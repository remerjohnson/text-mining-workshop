LOS ANGELES - University

killed and three USC tudents 
were injured early Monday 
morning in a fire at their 
residence. Dunigan. ~ current 
university staff member, was 
found on the second floor after 
the fire was extingui hed. The 
other nine re ident were able 
to exit the house safely after 
all were awakened by a fellow 
roommate. The cause of the 
fire is under investigation, but 
authorities believe faulty 
wiring was to blame. The turn-
of-the-century house did not 
have a fire detector and was 
covered with wooden shingles, 
which contributed to the rapid 
spread of the lire.

CHICAGO, III. - The 
University of Chicago 
Student Activitirs Office has 
decided to reinstate a single-
sex swimming time by the 
end of the quarter. The long-
standing policy had been 
aboli hed at the beginning of 
this year because of com-
plaints that the policy 
violated Title IX of the 
United States Code, which 
prohibits discrimination on 
the basis of sex. Several 
student protested the 
decision to allow co-cd

was appointed last night to replace outgoing 
Internal Vice Pre ident Greg Field. 

"I'm very pleased that Alex Sario is com-
ing in as the new internal vice president," 
A.S. President Coleen Sabatini said. "As 
commissioner of student advocacy, he has 
proven to be extremely dedicated, hard-
worki ng and effective." 

Also under consideration for the position 
were current Direclor of Public Relations 
Christy Guidi, former ommissionerof tu-
dent Advocacy Sou ley Diallo, former 
Roosevelt senator Jason Davis, former In-
ternal Vice Presidenl John Barnes and one 
applicant who applied on condition of ano-
nymity. 

Sario's appointment is effective Nov. 22, 
1996. The counci l will begin recruiting for 
his replacement immediately. 

In an unrelated event, two college sena-
tors re igned from their po ition . Both res-
ignations are effective immediately. 

Reve lle junior Senator Elishia Breed cited 
Lime constraints and declining grades as the 
rea 'on for her resignation, and Mar hall 
junior Senator Mousqa Katawazi said she 
felt that her efforts were beller spent in other 
areas, uch as community outreach. 

The meeting began with Chancellor Rob-

plan to formulate a commitlee 10 address the 
issue. 

The commitlee will con ist of students, 
staff, and faculty and will review an existing

UCSD Chemists Build 
Better Protein Trap 
CELLS: Scientists use porous gels to capture and 
study proteins under microscope 
By AI.x Gorman 
Guardian Reporter 

A team of UCSD scientists led 
by Chemistry and Biochemistry 
Professor W. E. Moerner has de-
veloped a new technique for cap-
turing and studying proteins, a 
basic component of living cells. 

protei n must open. Some part must 
close. That's the pan that 's been 
hard to understand, because we 
don ' t ha ve a clear picture of that 
right now, of exactly how that hap-
pens." 

In ' water, proteins are in con-
stant motion because of the forces 

The chemists 
use a porous gel, 
maintained under-
water at room tem-
perature, to capture 
the proteins and 
then observe them 
under the micro-
scope. Fluorescent 
dyes allow the sci-
entists to view the 
molecules. 

A great i mprove-
men! above previ-
ous methods for ob-
serving molecules, 
the protein trap 
mimics tpe insideof 
an actual cell. 

" We are doing 
lhis in an environ-
ment which allows 
the protein to retain 
its native structure 
and its functions to 
rema in intact," 
Mocrner said. 

In the last few 
years, sc ienti sts 
have learned a good 
deal about protein 
structure through 
the advent of ncw 
technologies such as 
nuclear-magnetic 
resonance and other 
typcs of spectros-
copy. 

These methods 
allowed researchers

Moerner and his

spectroscopy that 
attempted to alle-

Using a crystal 
lattice, M oerner 
captured a single

entists still knew very little about 
protei n function because the frozen 
crystal lattice did not bear enough 
si milarity to the inner workings of a

Preserved Oarfish Head On Display 
The Scripps Institution of Oceanography's Birch 

Aquarium is temporarily displaying the preserved head 
of a 24·foot oarfish found on a Coronado beach. 

The head, which measures about two feet high, will 
be displayed at the aquarium in a specially designed 
case. The entire fish is believed to have weighed about 
250-300 pounds. 

Oarfish are the longest borly fish in the ocean, and 
their life cycle is largely a mystery. Scientists believe 
that the fish can swim at depths of 1,500 feet. 

The Birch Aquarium is located at 2300 Expedition 
Way in La Jolla. It is open every day of the year (except 
Christmas and Thanksgiving). Admission for adults is 
$6.50; seniors, 55.50; students, $4.50; and children 
(ages 3-12), $3.50.

compare between the writing pr0-

Karlon, who is also the council's 
student representative (rom the 
bioengineering department. 

The council also expressed con-
cern over existing policies concern-
ing section enrollment and class 
size, as well as the lack of grievance 
confidenti ality. 

GSA President Vicki Mayersug-
gested creating an ombudsman to 
serve as a liaison between students 
and faculty , and to assi t with com-
plaints against the university while 
protecting student anonymity. 

' 'The grievance procedure is not 
confidential inside your depart -
ment," Mayer said. "The faculty 
talk amongst each other about you 
and your complaint. " 

Sworder also said he would like 
to change currenl uni vcrsi ty policy, 
which allow students 10 a(lend any 
. ect ion regardless of the one in 
which they arc enrolled. 

Sworder said hc promotes fixed 
enrollment in sections, and that he 

wishes departments were more 
aware of potential conflicts when 
scheduling classes. 

Later in the meeting, UCSD 
School of Medicine Associate Dean 
of Student Affairs Maria Savoia 
spoke about plans to lease UCSD 
Medical Center facilities to the ei-
ther the Sharp, Scripps or TenetJ 
OrNda healthcare chain. 

Savoia said the university first 
approached Kaiser Permanente with 
the idea of a lease, but Kaiser turned 
the offer down. However. TenetJ 
OrNda approached UCSDon its own. 

Savoia told the council that only 
the building and the equipment 
would be leased. The lease would 
not sacrifice staff posi lions or the 
mission of the medical center. 

In other busi ness. the council 
.approved a re olution in support of 
ex tending soft-benefits - includ-
ing library and RIMAC privil eges 
- to domestic partners " regardless 
of exual preference." 

The council did not approve a 
simi lar resolution attacking UC Prcsi-
dent Richard Atkin on for delaying a 
bill granting housing and health ben-
efits to the domestic partncrs of UC 
employee. but approved a third reso-
lution against the proposed $40 " In-

Sometimes people to do the wrong thing for the right 
reasons. Unfortunately, this is precisely what's happening 
on our campus with the graduate teaching-assistant 
strike. 

Graduate students have legitimate complaints. Their 
jobs are supposed to require 20 hours of work per week, 
and that is the amount of work for which they are con-
tracted and paid. However, according to the TAs, they 
consistently work much more than that. They say their 
jobs often require 40 hours of labor or more a week. 

This situation is not right. Like any other group of 
employees, TAs should be paid for the work that they 
actually perform. 

We would like to remind the administration that the 
number-one priority of a university should be teaching. 
That being established, they also need to remember this 
old adage: You get what you pay for. 

The administration should raise TA salaries to a level 
that attracts and retains the highest-quality workers; They 
should also look to compensate for this added expense 
by cutting back in non-teaching areas - not by raising 
student fees. 

While the administration needs 1.0 address the issue of 
appropriate salaries, unionization is not the answer to the 
TAs' plight. If she TAs successfully unionize and obtain 
collective bargaining rights, what will happen? 

One needs only look at the departments in which there 
i a dearth of available graduate-student labor: These 
departments employ qualified undergraduates instead. If, 
sometime in the future, an established graduate-studenl 

un~on decides that its members will not work for the pre-
vailing wage, the administration will undoubtedly turn to 
this option. 

Historically, the recourse of union 10 lower-priced 
compet ition has been to demand a clo. ed shop, where 
onl);' union members may be hired to work at the union 
wage. This elimination of competition is never good 
from the consumer's standpoint, as the quality of the out-
put is poorer and the price higher than in a competitive 
situation. 

Instead of striking, the TAs need to pursue other 
options - such as completing only the amount of work

rectify contract inequities. These actions would be more 
consistent with their goa l of fair compensation and

Barring any further delays, former UCSD staff mem-
ber Ernest Lee will be sentenced tomorrow for his role in 
several burglaries. While the maximum sentence of 12 
years in state prison he faces is somewhat excessive, the 
single year in county jail Lee's probation officer recom-
mends is nothing more than a slap on the wrist. 

Lee, who worked in UCSQ's Student Judicial Affairs 
office of all places, was tried and convicted this summer 
of two counts of first-degree residential burglary. 

Residential burglary is a serious crime, and Lee 
refused to admit his guilt until recently. Lee needs to be 
sent away, both for his own good and for ours. He has 
been diagnoled with a severe psychological problem -
obsessive-compulsive disorder - and has said he can't 
pIII"UIIee he won't commit the crimes again. For this

PROPOSITION 209 PROTESTS 
ARE ANYTHING BUT CIVIL 

COMMENTARY: Recent student demonstrations against the demise 
of affirmative action are exercises in civil mischief, not civic virtue 

Nat e 
PIETILA 

Predictably, the passage of 
Proposition 209 ha:; brought 
much upheaval to the University 
of California. Campus by campus, 
student protesters have 
denounced the retreat from affir-
mative action in several different 
ways. 

The first night after the elec-
tion, 28 UC 
Berkeley Stu-

Resident dents thought 
Gadfly that locking 

reaction from students in these classes ranged from 
inwardly to openly hostile. Some Chemistry 1408 stu-
dents, facing a midterm the following Friday, were so 
upset thal they shouted down the protesters. 

And how could we forget the anti-CCRI prote tthat 
erupted at UCSD last March? After rallying in the 
Price Center, demon trators marched through campus 
and took their protest to the intersection of La Jolla 
Village Drive and Villa La Jolla, where they were duly 

arrested for unlawful protest. 
Protesters also interrupted last 

Thursday's meeti ng of the UC 
Board of Regents. About 50 UC 

---..:;....;-- themselves 
inside the Campanile bell tower 
would be the best way to make 
their prote t known and keep 
California from retreating in the 
bailie for civil rights . Somewhat 
remarkable by Berkeley standards 
was the fact that as police officers 
moved in to remove the protesters, 
the students walked out voluntarily, 
and were cited and released. 

Other Berkeley students 
While the First 
Amendment 

tudent stood up in the middle of 
the meeting and staned clapping 
their hands and boisterously chant· 
ing, among other things, "No uni -
ver ity without diversity." Also, 
during the morning public com-
ment period, several students tried 
to address Proposition 209 by read· 
ing a transcript of an obscene 
phone ca ll made to an activi t at 
UCI, only to be ruled out of order. 

Some people might de cribe the 
preceding incidents as act of civil 
disobedience. [ would submit, 
however, that there is nothing civil 
- nothing adult - about locking 
yourself inside a public building 
just because you thought the gov-
ernment was doing somelhing 
wrong. There is nothing civil about 
stealing newspapers, making death 
threats, disrupting classes or inter-
fering with the nonnal now of traf-
fic . And, when it comes to political 
discourse, there is nothing civil 
about disrupting a public meeting 

expressed their outrage by stealing 
all 23,000 copies of the election 
day issue of the Daily Californian 
because it had the temerity to 
endorse the purponedly misnamed 
California Civil Rights initiative. 
This action cOSt the Daily Cal thou-
sands of dollars in printing costs 
and 1051 advenising revenue. Daily 
Cal Editor in Chief Mike Coleman 
also received death threats from 
anonymous 209 opponents. 

Eleven days ago. students at UC 
Riverside decided 10 protest by tak-

with profanity. ing over UI administration building and demanding 
that the univenity reruse to comply with Proposition 
209. This ripnarole disrupted normal university busi-
ness for at least six hours. 

Last Wednesday, between 50 and 60 UCSD slu-
dents marched IIOUnd campus in protesl of 209. This

"Hi Manin," I sigh. I was wait-

I talked with a week ago about the 
death of racism in this country. Can

"Yes, I saw the news. And you 
know what? I' m still going to fill up 
at Texat.:o," I tell him. 

"WHAT!? WHYI?" 
Here's why. 
For those of you whose sole 

source of news is the Gllardian 
(God bles your little heans), you 
missed some recent event in cor· 
porate America. It turns out that a 
number of Texaco senior executi ves 
were naming racists - obnoxious 
enough that a disgusted co· worker 
surreptitiously used a cassette 
recorder to catch them on tape. 

The tape revealed that the exec-
utives commented about how all the

~ More damaging. the tape also 
recorded them di sc us~ing their 
plans to re~ord two ets of notes 
from their meetings - a sanitiled 
version for public records and a real 
version (wi th all the racist policy) 
for internal corporate usc. Well . all 
this bad behavior is finally coming 
out to haunt them, isn ' t if I All of 
this information came out in a 
recent discrimination suit fi led 
against Texaco, a suit the company 
settled for over $130 million. 

Never one to allow such an easy 
chance to rally hatred against 
whites to pass him by, the ever· 
opportunistic Reverend Jcs 'e 
Jac kson called for an African-
American boycott of Texaco. AI 
Sharpton, the slick-haired, Annani-
attired crusader against poveny, 
was quoted as sayi ng (with regards 
to the $130 million settlement),

Troublemaking is

Continued from pace 4 
mailer how worthy ant i-abortion 
protesters think their cause is, they 
are not justified in engaging in just 
any ki nd of lawles acti vity. 

But how do we draw the line 
between civil di sobedience and 
civi l mischief? Civi l di sobedience 
is disobeying a law that one finds 
morally objectionable. For exam-
ple, many sick and/or terminally ill 
people lind that smoking marijuana 
provides some relief. Federal law, 
as it stands, prohibits uch activity. 
Nevertheless, some people think 
the law is unjust and refuse to obey 
it. 

Notice that most people who 
disobey this law don't go out and 
get in other people's faces about it , 
or violate some other law merely 
out of protest. Even though they

made pUblic, and that the picketers 
forced him to close his station for a 
few days, at a cost of $2,000 per 
day. 

Nonetheless, it 's easy to imagine 
all the ethnic activists coming out of 
the woddwor1c now, finge rs a-wag-
ging. "You see?" they crow, "Didn ' t 
we ,ell you there was institutional-
ized racism in America?" 

Funny. These are the same peo-
ple who would fall all over them-

think that denying relief to suffer-
ing people is one of the mo t 
immoral things government can do, 
they still realize that other criminal 
activity unrelated to the law in 
question solves nothing. 

Civi l mischief, on the other 
hand, is di sobeyi ng a law that is nOl 
immoral and that ha nothing to do 
wi th the law that one does finc4 
morally objectionable. Violating a 
law that prohibits people from arbi-
trarily disrupting a class is an act of 
civil mi schief. Blocking an inter-
section is also an act of civil mis-
chief, as is forcefully taking over a 
public building. 

While the First Amendment 
guarantee that we have the right to 
speak out on the issues of the day, 
it does not grant us the right to dis-
rupt the li ves of other people in 
making our opinions known. It also 
does not give u the option of 
invading people's personal space

whites at large. Challenged by the 
paucity of evidence of the so-called 
hidden racism against blacks, 
activists invented the notion of 
"institutionalized racism" to keep 
people like Jesse Jackson and AI 
Sharpton in power. 

Alas, every crackpot theory, no

They marched. They didn't burn 
newspapers, and they didn't t~ke

they did do was stand up, speak out 
and cla im their full rights as

But what about Ro a Paries' act

proper for people of her color? 
Wasn't she being mischievous 
rather than just di sobedient? 
Simply put, no. She was willfully 
disobeying what she thought -
and what all of us today agree -
was a bad, immoral law. 

The Proposition 209 protesters 
need to realize that political change 
can be brought about through con-
ventional means. The progress on 
civil rights came about not through 
civil mischief, but by people exer-

salesman in the used-car section of 
the screwball ideas lot? 

Are the ac tions of corporate 
executi ves an accurate barometer of 
race relations in America? Certainly 
not. The Texaco incident simply 
gives those on the activist fringe an 
ideological bogeyman against 
which to rally. Those of us not on 
the lunatic fringe simply shake our 
heads with disgust at the corporate 
officers, and move on with our lives. 

The truth is, we have come far in 
the course toward racial progress. 
How many blacks today would want 
to step back in time to even 20 years 
ago? As citizens, we need to ignore 
the noise coming from the desperate 
activists trying to preserve whatever

It was by engaging people in vigor-

defined "fighting words," censor-
ship of " racist" opposition to affir-
mat ive action or altempts to shout 
down politically incorrect peakers 
betray a lack of respect for real 
diversity. 

The desire for censorship is gen-
era lly steeped in two intenwining 
motivations: condescension and 
fear. Tho~e who are afraid of othcr 
people's ideas ei ther don ' t know 
their own argument well enough to 
properly defend it, or arc afraid that 

their argument won't stand up to 
rigorous scrutiny. 

The eondeseension comes from 
those who have an almost religious 
faith that their view is correct, and 
that those of us who don't agree 
with it are simply unenlightened 
dollS. They also believe that most 
people can't grasp their high , exalt-
ed concepts and would be easily led 
astray from the true path if exposed 
to the evil logic of the counter-
arguments. 

Those who worship the false 
di versity altempt to pass off name-
calling, insult and unsupported 
claims for a logical discu sion of 
the issues. They try to si lence oppo-
nents through the slieer volume of, 
rathcr than thc strength of, their 
argument. They altempt to impugn 
the motives of those advancing the 
argument they question.

PROTEINS: 
Moemer hopes to 
reveal cell's secrets 
C ... II ............. 2 

It was a large step from single-
molecule spectroscopy 10 some-
thing thaI resembled the · cellular 
system. A new method required a 
water-based environment, the abil -
ity to work at room temperature, 
and space for the molecule to move 
while still restricting it enough for 
the researchers to observe it. 

A postdocto ral student on 
Moerner's team, RobertDixon, was 
up to the cha llenge. He noted that 
polyacry lam ide (P AA ). a transpar-
ent gel often used in molecular bi -
ology. contained tiny pores full 'of 
water. Dixon and his colleagues 
used PAA to trap proteins that con-
tained tluorescenttags, then used a 
laser to light them up. 

"Eventually. after figuring out 
how 10 look forthem, where to look 

anywhere 

for them. we bepn to see indio 
vidual molecules that were moving 
around in the gel throughout its 
porous structure," Dixon said. 

Since the gel mimics nuid con-
ditions inside a cell, the proteins 
behave in the same way they would 
in Iheir natural selling. Dixon and 
Moerner estimate the gel makes the 
protein move about a hundred times 
slower than it would in a cell, al -
lowing researchers to observe the 
molecules for longer periods of 
time. 

Moerner and his fellow scien-
tists say that they hope their re-
~earch will help shed light onto 
di seases and how cells react to them. 
Understanding how proteins behave 
may also help chemists develop 
new drugs to combat illne s. 

Moerner say he also hopes 10 
use this new technique to explore 
the structure of the cell itself. 

"This could have applications in 
the tudy of other types of separa-
tion materials," Moemer said.

PhIsh 
Billy Breathes 

-•• 

After countless years of non-stop 
touring, it seems that Vermont's free-
wheeling and non-stru(;tured hippie-
cult ensemble Phish is tired. On their 
siKth studio album, Billy Breatlres, it 
becomes clear that Phish needed 
some time to relax and unwind from 
their unpredictable performance 
style. 

Certain Phish constants never 
change, and that certainly i~ the 
case on Billy Breatlres. The non-
sensical lyrics arc endearing, and 
all of' the tracks remain mostly 
eKperimental , with the band enjoy-
ably stretching musical form to it s 
outer limits. But fati gue has set in. 
The album is heavy in airy hallads, 
which arc actually rather relaxing. 

8illy Breathes seems to relay a 
message to all Phish-heads that the 
band is worn oul and needs a break 
from their relentless touring sched-
ule. The liner no te~ warn "The 
Phish stuff is prett y slow for now."

mob, as guitarist and lead singer 
Trey Anastasio cries, "Much ado is 
alii see /1 feel like it 's surrounding 
me I A crowd intrudes all day II' m 
finally swept away." 

Other tracks, such as "Free," 
also suggest Phish needs a vacation. 
On the album's last song, "Prince 
Caspian," based on C.S. Lewis' 
sequclto children's novel Tire lion, 
tire Witch and the Wardrobe, the 
band harmonizes beautifully, with-
out any singu lar strong vocal pres-
ence in the band. 

The tracks are still signature 
Phish and have their moments, but 
much like a tablespoon of codeine, 
they all seem to induce drowsiness. 
Billy Breatlres seems to lack the 
direction and the punch that made 
Phish's past material. Ask any 
Ph ish-head, though, and you'll 
know that the band 's real strength 
comes from thei r knockout live 
shows. If you need a good nap, 
however, check out Billy Breatlres.

Hell On Earth 

LIMR .. .,i. 
-..... 

Last year, when Mobb Deep 
released The Infamous ... , hip-hop 
heads received a glimpse into the 
lives of Queensbridge, .Y. , 
natives Havoc and Prodigy. One 
year later, Loud Records releases 
Hell Oil Earlh, the Mobb's third 
album. This latest effort follows the 
same lines as the previous two, ver-
balizing the Mobb's devotion to 
living trife. 

Mobb Deep remains lyrically 
untouchable, providing evocative 
interpretations of life in the streets. 
Although the bealS never equal the 
ferocity of "Shook One Pt. II," they 
are rock-solid. proving their creator, 
Havoc, is a skilled producer. 

Overall. the new Mobb Deep 
album favors a more mellow 
approach. complemented oy guest 
appearances by fellow QBC native 
NAS, Wu-Tang members Method 
Man and Raekwon, as well as Mobb 
Deep affiliates such as Big Noyd. 

An added.bonus is that the CD 
has been enhanced, and doubles as 
a CD-ROM. A biography, video 
clips and a Loud Records catalog 
are all accessible through Macin-
tosh or mM compatible computers. 
This is an interesting feature for a 
CD, suggesting future multimedia 
possibilities for artists. 

Hip-hop is permeated by artists 
claiming the gun-toting, Moet-sip-
ping, cash-stacking gangster image, 
but questions concerning thei r 
authenticity often arise. Straight out 
of Queensbridge, Mobb Deep 
embodies the essence of this 
lifesty le, and Hell on Earth is a hard 
hilling tribute to the trife life.

Now I Got Worry 

-• ••• 

The intensity of the Jon Spencer 
Blues EKplosion's well-received scc-
ond album, Orange, is matched on 
Its latest effort, Now I Cor WOf/)'-
which may be an understatement to 
any fan . Audiences fami liar with the 
Blues EKp losion's heavy blues-rock 
sound. argue that the latest release is 
their best yet. Beyond all else, Now 
I Cot Worry is lhe band 's most con-
sistent release to date. 

At first. Now I Cot Worry seems 
reminiscent of the band 's first two 
records, plagued with the blues 
influence of guitarist Judah Bauer 
and singer/guitarist Jon Spencer. 
And like their past records. drummer 
Russell Simins gives the blues a 
funkier twist. 

But unlike their past records. this 
16-song release will appeal to all lis-
teners, with its consistent yet diverse 
experience in blues, rock and funk 
with a twist of soul. Spencer's vocals 
boost the confidence of his music 
when singing lines like, "Kiss my 
ass/'Cuz your girlfriend still loves 
me," and 'Take a standIFuck the 
man." 

On the album, the Jon Spencer 
Blues Explosion also solicits out-
ide help to add a few extra spices 

and give t~e listener a more definite 
taste. Now I Cot Wor/)"s "Chicken 
Dog" features blues singer Rufis 
Thomas. "Fuck Shit Up" is a cover 
of a song by the Olympia-based 
Dub Narcotic Sound System. 

The Jon Spencer Blues Explo-
sion will perform at SOMA Live 
thi s Saturday, Nov. 23, with R.L. 
Burnside and High Notes of the 
West Coast Pop Underground.

Bleed Your Cedar 
IIIllt.ell .. R_ 

-•• 

Bleed YOllr Cedar, the debut 
album by Elysian Fields, lacks 
originality in its every aspect. 
Dominated by its depre~sing , unin-
spired lyrics. the group opens no 
new doors musica ll y. 

The band is composed of yet 
another female vocalist. Jennifer 
Charles, backed by an all -male band. 
Charles has a light, airy voice, com-
parable to Mazzy Star's Hope San-
doval. Ironically, she also resembles 
her contemporary. 

Although her simplified. 
depressing lyri cs take away from 
the musical quality of the album, 
Charles almost redeems herself in 
the final track, "Mermaid." In ·the 
song, Charles' voice is accompa-
nied by an acoustic guitar. She pro-
vides a liUle more variation with 
her voice in accordance with the 
incongruent lyrics. 

For a debut album, Bleed YOLir 
Cedar offer minimal potential. 
The only possibility for success lies 
in the musical contributions to the 
album, as they are pi votal in the 
band's future . Elysian Fields might 
find more fulfillment if they create 
their own sound, instead of cloning 
tho e that have already been estab-
lished.

Social Distortion 
American punk rock pioneers 

By Scott Yager 
Guardian Reporter 

Punk rock in the U.S. was 
a dangerous force in the 
1970' • used by angry youths 
to " pit" in the face of soci-
ety. 

ocia l Distortion, one 
highl y influential band from 
that first wave of American 
punk rock. resurrected it s 
aggressive blend of punk 
and rockabilly at SOMA 
Live last Saturday night, 
creating a niche for them-
selves alongside the influx 
of pop-punk bands bom-
barding today's music 
scene. 

The band was welcomed 
on-stage by wild and thun-
derous applause from the 
audience . With lead singer 
Mike Ness prowling the 
'stage, sporting a sequined 
Las Vegas;style shirt and hi s 
trademark sneer, the band 
roared into a cover of the 
Rolling Stones' "Under My 
Thumb." an unli sted track 
on Social Di storli on's 
newe t album, White Light, 
White Heat. 
White Trash . 

Ness and his 
band mates ripped 
through a rough ly 
equal mix of old 
and new songs -
ranging from the 
current radio hit 
" I Was Wrong" to 
some of Social 
D's more "old school" mate-
rial like "Mommy's Little 
Monster" and " 1945 ." 

PhOIO by Frank Ockenlels 
Social Distortion: Band on tour promoting new album. 

Th e band managed to 
deliver the urgency and soul 

of th ei r material 
through ex uberant 
musicianship and 
Ness' unmistakable 
growling voice. 

Ness and gui-
tarist Denni s 
Danell ex tracted 
every bit of life 
from their guitars, 
while Social Dis-

tortion ' new drummer 
Chuck Biscuits pounded the 
day lights out or hi s set. 

The enthusiastic crowd at 
SOMA clamored for more in 
between songs. The usually 
~toic Ness played to the 
crowd, praising San Diego 
as "one of the only places 
that would have Socia l Di -
tortion" in the old days. 

After a one and-a-half 
hour set, the band ob liged 
the screaming crowd wi th a 
three-song encore, which 
included the crowd favorite 
"Ball And Chain" and a 
cover of Johnny Cash's 
"Ring Of Fire."

HOPPER: 
MoCA presents 
film retrospective 
Continued from page 14 
the book Farlller by Jim Harrison, 
thc siory revolves around a middle-
aged school teacher tcmpted into 
an affair with a student. 

The film stars Hopper, Amy Irv-
ing, Amy Locaine, Julie Harris. 
Gary Buscy and Hal Holbrooke 
and is directed by Bruno Barello. It 
is a reunion of sorts for Hopper and 
Busey, who worked together two 
ycars ago in ··Chascrs." 

Hopper began his acting career 
here in San Dicgo al thc Old Globe 
TIlcatcr and the La Jolla Playhouse 
in the 1950's. His film debut came 
soon after in 1955, when he 
appearcd in "Rcbel Without a 
Cause." Throughout his career he 
has perfccted thc "radical" charac-
ter and pu hed the limits with his 
supporting roles in such films as 
"Apocalypse Now," "Waterworld" 
and "Blue Velvet." His ability to 
play many di vcrsc characters ha 
allowed him to work across differ-
ent genres. from an films to violent 
dramas to dark-comedy/action 
fi Ims ("Super Mario Brothers," 
"True Romance").

The Mirror Has Two Faces 
Streisand gets her man in romantic comedy 

By Carol Shum 
Staff Writer 

Bamra Streisand plays the unfor-
tunate underdog who triumphs 
when she gets her man in 'The Mir-
ror Has Two Faces," a modem-day 
adaptation of the ugly duckling's 
struggle. However, this movie 
becomes pathetic when the ugly 
duckling transforms to a swan and 
the message of the movie is lost. 

Strcisand portray Ro e Mor-
gan, an unmarried romance- litera-
ture professor who is the victim of 
several complications in an other-
wi e happy life. She li ves with her 
mother (Lauren Bacall), is madly" 
jealous of her beautiful younger 
sister (Mimi Rogers) and has a 
crush on her handsome brother-in-
law (Pierce Brosnan). 

Meanwhile, mathematics pro-
fessor Greg Larkin (Jeff 
Bridges), burned by love 
too many times. places a 
wa nt ad for a woman 
interested in inte llectual 
conversat ions. Rogers 
sends her sister's picture. 
and the professors meet. 
He enjoys Rose's compa-
ny so much that , even 
though they have not even ki ssed. 
he proposes marri age. 

Rose is in love and convinces 
herself th at she will gradually work 
sex into the unconventional union. 
When her attempt f ai Is, she l oso.:~ 
weight. buys a new wardrobe, and 

Pholo by David James 
Family matters: (From left) Bacall , Bridges and Streisand in "Mirror." 
gets a makeover. 

The' first · half of the movie is a 
delightful romantic comedy depict-

ing Rose and Greg" 
unique courtship. 
Bridges captures Greg's 
confusion when he mis-
takenly tries to apply log-
ical mathematical theo-
ries to human relations. 

However in tbe sec-
ond half, the film fall s 
apart. The movie makes 

no sense when Rose uccessfu lly 
seduces her brother-in-taw in order 
to prove that her new Cinderella 
looks can capture anyone, even 
Greg. At the end of the movie, the 
confus ion lies in whether Greg fall s 
in love with the old or new Rose. 

'The performances of Roger and 
Baeall arc especially strong. Despite 
her character's limitation, Rogers 
holds herself well as the bitchy sis-
ter. As the once bcauti I' u I mother. 
Bacall gi ves the be t performance, 
reminding Rose lhat she wi ll never 
find happiness because of her looks. 

In the spotlight, Strei sand cannot 
hold herself as an actress. During 
her transformation. she fail s to show 
any change in attitude, only a 
change in her tas te in fashion . As the 
director. Strcisand refuses 10 let her 
own vanity go because even as the 
pre-transformed Rose, she still 
looks terri lie. 

The message of the movie is 
confusi ng. As in any relationship. it 
sends mixed signals.

I think it innuences every step. 
It 's not like iI's a preachy spirilU-
alily, but you try to live it in every 
step that you take, musically and 
non-musically. It 's a thing that 
we try 10 keep in touch with. 

I believe that we're rcsponsi -
ble for bringing music through, 
but I don' t believe we ' re the 
source of the music. We' re lucky 
enough to be the channels that 
bring it through. 
What kind of ... experi-
ence w .. HORDE? 

It was cool in a lot of respects. 

themselves, we can't understand 
for the life of us why they would 
want to hurt each olher. 

People watch MTV and see 
Eddie Vedder climb up. the wall, 
and he jumps off and he body 
surfs, and it looks really coo l. 
What they don't realize is Ihat a lot 
of people around them who come 
to see us haven' t been watching 
MTV and don't know anything 
about that. As a result , they don't 
look up when they should, and 
they get dropped on and get their 
houlder dislocated and their nose 

busted. h suck for us to watch 
people get hurt while we' re on 
stage trying to do something.

The UCSD Guardian Thursday, November 21, 1996 

First of all, it got us in front of a 
lot of new people that maybe had 
thought about seeing us bUI didn ' t 
have the opportunity or desire to 
do it because they didn ' t know 
whal we were. II really turned us 
on to a whole 101 of people. 

It didn't feel right. We could 
have been a part of it, and it could 
have made us a lot bigger at the 
time, but it wasn' t the true spirit of 
Woodstock. It wasn't there lO bring 
all these bands together in the pirit 
of love, it was the spirit of Pepsi . It 
just didn't feel like the place for us. 
We still have our integrity because 
we did what we wanled to do. 
WIUIt can we expect on 
this tour?

was being able to meel all the

PIGSKIN: It's 
ti me for a football team 
Continued from pale 24 
rally around, Wecan be like one big, 
happy family - it will be beauti -
ful. 

Of course we would have 10 
start slow, beginning in 'Di vision 
Ill. Don' t worry, though, my plan 
will have us competing in Divi -
sion I soon enough . Here it is: 
after a healthy grant from our gra-
cious UC Regents, we can hire a 
quality coaching staff (I hear Lou 
Holtz is looking for a job), and 
level the fore t behind RIMAC 
(we ' ve got enough trees) to make 
room for a state-of-the-a rt siadium 
complete with luxury boxes and 
seating up to 50,000. 

In the grand .tradition of Coors 
Field and Busch Stadium, Karl 
Sirauss Stadium will be the new 
jewel in UCSD's architectural 
crown. 

Football will also require some 
fundamental policy changes, espe-
cially concerning recruiting. Sure, 
we' ll have to go out and give a few 
extra dol.lars to get quality players, 
but if you think talented alhletes 
choose schools because of the nice 
tour Ihey received on thei r visit to 
the school , I wish I could live in 
your dream world.ln the humble 
beginnings of our football program, 
we will stay in Division ilL 

But if my calculations are cor-
rect (and they usually are), we will 
begin with a 'focky season or two, 
but as is the case with most of our 
sports here, we will eventually 
begin to dominate. 

The difference between a win-
ning football program and other 
sports is money. As we continue to 
be an annual winner, we will at-
tract more fans, more media expo-
sure and mo ' money, Money is a 
big issue here, because it won ' t go 
solely to Ihe football leam - ev-
ery port gets a piece of the pie! 
With the ex tra cash flowing in , our 
entire at hletic program can begin 
its gradu al climb to Division I. 

This will also please the re-
gents, because once aga in they can 
take credit for a shrewd invest-
ment. And the students who 
whined last year about funding the 
sports program won ' t ha ve 10 
worry anymore. 

Another bonus that comes from 
winning on a national :;cale is rec-
ognition. UCSD is already in the 

SHABEL: Super 
sophomore takes third 
Continued from peee 24 

In Ihe final match of the 
Regionals, Shabel de feal ed a 
player from UC Santa Cruz and 
managed 10 earn himself a trip 10 
Memphis, Ga. 

" [The Regionalsl were diffi -
cull," Shabel said. "I had two 
matches Ihat could have gone ei-
ther way," 

Once he arrived at the Racquet 
Club of Memphis for his first Na-
tionals Competition, Shabel faced 
off against Adam Marcus of 
SUNY -Binghamton, who he beat 
easily in IWO sets. 

"l In this tournament, Shabel]just 
played about the same overalt," 
Turner said. "But he played a lillie 
better, and menially a little stron-
ger." 

Unfoctunately, Shabel was un-
able to defeat his semifinal ~­
petitor. Adam Norlander (rom 
Kalamazoo CoIlc,e, but mUlled 

upper echelon of academia, but 
let ' be honest, nobody know 
about it. Part of the reason why 
schools like Cal and UCLA are 
looked upon so highly is because 
of their athletic successes. We can 
join thi high-ranking club with 
our new-found athletic success, 
thus creating better jobs for all of 
us upon gradualion ! 

Believe it or not, I prediel that 
having a great football team will 
also boost our GPAs. Why? Be-
cause 10 field a winning team, we 
will have to adopt , shall we say, a 
slightly more lenient admissions 
policy to accomodate a special few 
students. 

And so what if their contribu-
tion 10 the school isn ' t with their 
grades, but on Ihe football field . 
Now, having these guys in your 
classes would do nothing but make 
your work look all the beller! 

Having a football team wi II re-
sult in a reaction that many of you 
here will not understand. A few 
here do -=- our two-time National 
Champion women 's soccer team, 
our women 's volleyball team and 
our men's waterpoloteam all know 
what I'm lalking about. 

Here's an example: You are off 
campus somewhere and someone 
foolishly dares to slander our foot-
ball tea m. You calmly explain to 
this loser that your Tritons are on 
their way to another Bowl game, 
but he doesn't li sten. Don ' t be sur-
pri sed if you find yoursel f scream-
ing at him and maybe ev.en threat-
ening him. 

It 's OK, it' s called pride. See 
kids, when you are good at so me-
thing, being happy about it and 
even having a willingness to de-
fend it is perfectly normal. 

Thai 's why when we watch col-
lege football, we see people'scream-
ing and yelling wilh their faces 
painted. It 's not only because they 
are raging drunk, it's becau e they 
have pride in their school! Yes, we 
can achieve this too. 

We would even have a natural 
ri va l in SDSU. With my plan, we 
can eventually beat them at their 
own game. See, with football here, 
you can no longer whine about 
UCSD. 

Every weekend can be like the 
SUit God Festival. By bringi ng 
football to campus you will have 
more fun, you will make more 
money, and basically all of your 
problems will be solved. 

Just accept football. 

to upset Ion Stuart from Williams 
College for third place. 

UCSD has never had an athlete 
win the Regionals or appear in the 
National Championship, and this 
was Shabel's firsl showing in the 
Rolex tournamenl. 

Because of his success at the 
Rolex , Shabel will have an easier 
time qualifying for Ihe NCAA Di-
vision III Nationals after the up-
coming 1997 eason. 

Last year, Shabel played in the 
No.4 spot behind Dan Brounstein, 
Mike Wi I son and Eric Steidlmayer. 
Wilson and Steidlmayer ended 
their Triton tennis careers last sea-
son, and Shabel hopes to move 
into the No. I or No. 2 spot when 
the learn's season begins ne)! t quar-
ter ' 

"(My abilities as a player] hue 
improved quite a bit since last year, 
especially over the summer," 
Shabel said. "It's hard to say ript 
IIOW (how the team wilt do lICit 
IeUOItJ - we definitely have a 
chanc:e to do well and we have a 
preUy solid leam."

Crunch Time for UCSD Polo 
WWPA: Traveling to Colorado Springs for the Western Water Polo 
Association's Championships, the Tritons look to reach the Final Four 
., ..... R ........ 
Spotts Editor 

Coming off two tough losses last 
week against Division ( Pepperdine 
(12-13)and Long Beach Stale (9-13), 

the UCSD men 's wa-
ter polo team has the 
daunting task to put 
the defeats behind 
them and move on. 
You see,there isacer-
tain tournament held 
at the end of the year 
that detennines who 

will represenllhe We tern Water Polo 
Association in the NCAA Final Four. 

And this happens to be the week-
end that the WWPA crown will go 
up for grabs, Vying for the litle will 
be the perennial favorite s, Air Force 
Academy, UC Davis and the Tri -
tons. And UCSD is no stranger to 
Ihe WWPA title, having won it nine 
times. In this season's tournament , 
the Tritons arc ranked second be-
hind Air Force and just ahead of 
Davis. 

Before nying to Colorado, UCSD 
lost to the 4gers at Long Beach on 
Tuesday, Nov. 14. Romas Kudirka 
once again led UCSD in scoring with 
fuur poinls, followed by Amir 
Mont as. ir with Ihree and R os~ 
Mecham with two, Long Beach State 
recorded fourtwo-point goalsen route 
to the ."ictory. 

"In Ihe Long Beach game, il w~ 
just the ca~e that they had more two-
rOmler.,," Triton Head Coach Denny 

Harper said "We put the ball in the net 
as much as lhey did, but they [obvi-
ously) scored more twos." 

The Tritons were looking to re-
bound from lhe loss on Tuesday with 
a victory over the Waves last Satur-
day al Canyon view Pool, but 
Pepperdine spoiled lhe palty, knock-
ing off UCSD with a 13- 12 come 
from-behind win. 

"We had some pretty good perfor-
mances against higher-ranked teams 
[LBS and PepperdineJ," goalie Joe 

Welsh said, "We're prelly wired for 
this weekend." 

The Tritons' legacy of success at 
the WWPA Championships is re-
flected in theconfidence shown by the 
players and eoaches, 

"( don't care what the seedings are 
nationally," Harper said . "We' ve won 
Ihis thing nine times, so we are lhe 
team to beat, There's no doubt that we 
respectleams like Air Force andDavis, 
but we' ve been here befure and know 
how to win."

WOMEN: An-
other record season? 
ContInued from PICe 34 
same team has allowed the Tri-
tons to overcome certain psy-
chological bogeymen together, 

"We are much more confi-
dent ," said senior team captain 
Pam Contini, "A lack of confi-
dence is what hurt us last year, 
We go into games with more 
confidence now, and i,4 makes. 
us that much beller." 

They will need that confi -
dence in the beginning of the 
season, as they will be tested 
early , This weekend the Tritons 
will be in Texa , participating 
in a tournament that includes 
three team s which all made the 
playoffs last year.

hopes for big season 
Continued from ..... 24 
intense duty II this crucial position, 
looking 10 oonlrolthe tempo of the 
fast-pacedTritonoffense. The6'6" 
Wall, among others. will have to 
step up to fill the void left by the 
injury of starter Mart Sebek. Oul 
unti I mid-December with a broken 
metacarpal,thesharp-shooling and 
ever-hustling Sebek will be sorely 
missed. 

"We're definitely going to lose 
a good player," sixth man Nick 
Maroutsos said , "butlthink we've 
1111ed hi s spot appropriately." 

The starting squad will sec ex-
tended duty this season. Though 
deep in talent, the men have a very 
limited numberof players who have 
seen dUly the past lew seasons. 

Otherkey perfonncrsshould be 
explosive forward Mike Thimgan, 
newcomer Mike McMillan and 
three-point bomber Maroutsos. A 
good freshman c1as will add depth 
to a team that normally plays eight 
or nine playCl's a game. Other than 
Aune, the team is not exceptionally 
tall, butlields a lineupofbig, skilled 
guards that should out match the 
competition. So whi Ie the team may 
be looki ng 10 get the ball to the 
consi tently superior Aune at ev-
ery opponunity, the Triton will 
nonetheless continue to fire up 
thrce-poilllcrs by the truckload.

THE COACH 
TRAVIS HILL 

I Want Football 
Right NOW 

Whine, whine, whine! 
That seems to be the 

favorite activity of many 
students here at UCSD. 

All I ever hear is, "We don ' t 
have thi , we don't have that!" 
. And the most popular one is, 
"We don't have any spirit!" 

UCSD Eyes its 
First Final Four 

There are many reasons 
why students at thi s fine 
institution are generally 
considered lifeless and 
apathetic, but I'm not going to 
go into that. The Coach is the 
kind of guy who looks for 
so lutions. In my opinion, we 
have so much potential here. 
For Pete's sake, let 's take 
advantage of it. 

PROMISING: UCSD women's basketball looks 
to reach the Division III championships this year 

My solution is simple. It 
will bring thousands of 
tudents together. It will be a 

fun distraction from school 
and, believe it or not, it will 
rejuvenate our dead party 
cene. Simply put, we need 

football! 

By Travis Hili 
Staff Writer 

Veteran fishermen have been 
known to believe that once a shark 
gets a taste for blood, it 
becomes a man-eater. It 
ca n be said that th e 
UCSD's women's basket-
ball team definitely ha a 
taste for blood thi s cason. 

Last year, the Tritons 
got a taste of the UCSD 
record books, recordi ng 
thei r fir ' t-ever playoff vic-
tory under Triton Head Coach Judy 
Malone. This yea r, however, the 
Tritons arc going fort he ki II , which 
means bad new for their oppo-
nents. 

"We' re looking forward to a 
good year," Malone said. "We' ve 
got four starters coming back. We 
made the second round of the play-
offs last year, this year we want to 
get further - we have our ights 
set on the Final Four." 

I know about all the 
different referendums concern-
ing 'the improvement of our 
athletic program that have 
failed atthi campus. But once 
again I remain positive. I just 
think the majority of the 
students were uninformed. So I 
have taken it upon myself to 
inform all of you misguided 
souls why football would do 
nothing but good for our 
school. 

Mark Patterson/GuMdian 

Hopes: Jungwirth (31) and company look to go all the way this year. 
Malone's women are intent on 

improving their 19-7 record from 

The addition of football to 
the athletic curriculum will 
definitely cause some contro-
versy, but regardless of the 
ideological or financial 
objections, I per onally 
gu,rantee it will bring people 

tog~ther . Whi Ie I cannot 
fathom why people can't 
appreciate a game that offers 
the beauty of a running back 
darting in and out of traffic 
combined with hits that have 
actually paralyzed men, I 
understand that there will be 
many who will hate football 
here. 

,Triton Hoopsters Optimistic 
SGUD: UCSD's starting five return to provide a fonnidabl~ line-up for 1997 

But even those who are 
ardently opposed to the idea 
will be able to band together
