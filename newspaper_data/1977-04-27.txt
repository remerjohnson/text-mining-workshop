Legislators 
Begin Talk on 
Bargaining Bill 

SACRAMENTO - A bill that 
would extend collective bargaining 
rights to employees of the 
University of California (UC) and 
the California State University and 
Colleges (CSUC) began its journey 
through the state legislature last 
week. 

The bill, AB 1091, is sponsored by 
Howard Berman (D-Beverly 
Hills). (Triton Times, April 4.) 
Berman and representatives of 
several employee organizations 
which support the bill testified at 
an informational hearing before 
the Assembly Subcommittee on 
Postsecondary Education. 

" I firmly believe that shared 
responsibility by the employer and 
employees, through their exclusive 
representative, is the most 
productive and equitable way to 
determine issues of mutUJil con-
cern," Bennan said earlier. 

John Vasconcellos (D-San Jose) 
who chairs the subcommittee, said 
he fears that the way the bill is 
written now, the Legislature might 
be left out of negotiations. 

He said he also fears the 
Educational Employment 
Relations Board, (EERB) , which 
would administer tbe law if the bill 
were passed, would be swamped . 
with work. 

Although "Bully II " didn 't finish in the money, Mrs. Ruth Cummins of San 
Diego decided to pay the extra dollar to keep him after the San Dieguito 
Jaycee's 24th Annual Jumping Frog Jamboree held Saturday in Del Mar. 
... . . takes two years to grow 'em this big, " she said. "It's cheaper to buy

UCSD's Institution for Continued Learning 

Retirees are Rising Force in University 
by Paul Watry 

Staff Writer 
Doris Brosnan thinks that it's time for the 

University of California to stand up and recognize the 
force of retired people in university life. 

Brosnan is both a member and coordinator for the 
Institute of Continued Learning (ICL), a seH-
supporting organization at UCSD which allows 
retired citizens to enjoy the benefits of receiving a 
college-level education at a mature age. 

" The ICL allows us to recharge our mental bat-
teries," claimed Brosnan. " Older people really enjoy 
being on campus and they really get a lot out of at-
tending classes." 

UC ProfeSsor Pushes 
Solar Plant Design 

by Dorothy Houton 
Staff Writer 

He is short, quick and convincing. He is a salesman 
trying to sell his design for a solar electricity plant or 
at least to gain acceptance for it. He goes up against 
the public and scientists, including a group of Applied 
Math, Engineering Science (AMES) professors and 
graduate students last Friday for an AMES seminar. 

"He" is Otto Smith, professor of electrical 
engineering and computer science at UC Berkeley. 
Smith seemed undaunted not only by the questions of 
the skeptical audience but from the oubursts of a 77 
year old. The questions seemed to .!trengthen his 
presentation, and now that President Carter is en-
couraging solar research and the development of 
solar technology, maybe Smith's presentation will be 
strong enough to bring him some luck ... 

Smith's plan provides for a solar plant that consists 
of heugona 50 meten long each covered with 312 
mirrors that reflect tbe radiation to receptors placed 
on towers 20 meten hiIb. The coDected energy is 
used to produce steam to be run throop a high 
preuure turbine. 

"I'm ,oinl to prtIeM to you a .ow electric plant 
that is feasibae, that can be built today with emunc 
tecmololY and wtU provide III with our future eneI'IY 
needs," claimed SmItb. 

c.t1 •• ld.PapI 

The Institute for Continued Learning was started 
on campus in 1975 by a small gr6up of retired citizens. 
It was fonned around a peer teaching concept. ICL 
" study groups" are in reality smaH discussion sec-
tions where each member contributes some facet of 
knowledge which he has researched. The final out-
come in the discussion groups is a result of research 
by members of the class. Individuals in the groups 
include everybody from Ph.Ds to housewives and 
retired professionals. " 

" Though 90 percent of us are MAs or above," 
claimed Brosnan, "everyone has something different 
to contribute, no matter what his educational 
background." UCSD students are especially en-
couraged to attend the discussion groups. 

Varied Course Offerings 
The many course offerings of ICL range from 

" archaeology" to "Shakespeare." Each course 
stresses aspects not usually found in a classroom. 
"For example," Brosnan said, "the Shakespeare 
class is examining the plays which will be appearing 
at the Old Globe Theater this summer. Later on we 
will be seeing the actual plays ... 

Another course is called "autobiography," in which 
participants form and write their own 
autobiographies for their families, grandchildren, or 
for publication. 

Members of ICL are also able to utilize various 
University facilities, such as the language 
laboratory, the crafts center and the University 
libraries. Also, members get a substantial discount 
on most extension courses in the University. 

And because ICL is part of the University, mem-
bers are free to audit any undergraduate or graduate 
class at UCSD. In addition, they can receive credit 
through " concurrent registration," where extension 
students can enroll in any UCSD course for credit. 

Saowb81Ung Effect 
"This program will have a snowballing effect for 

the simple reason that because of the zero percent 
population growth and the fact that a,reater number 
of people will be retired, the universities will have to 
start to serve another group of people. This group is 
the retired population." Already, Broanan pointed 
out. the program is in effect at Berkeley, Miami, 
Dartmouth. Yale, Harvard, New Hampshire and 
others.

Grow-Your-Own Pot Bill OKed 
By Assembly Justice Panel 

by Hugh Mcintosh 
Staff Correspondent 

SACRAMENTO - Legislation 
that would substantially reduce the 
penalty for growing small amounts 
of marijuana for personal use 
moved a step closer to becoming 
law Monday. 

By a five to two vote, the nine 
member state Assembly Criminal 
Justice Corrunittee approved a 
measure that would reduce the 
penalty for growing small amounts 
of non~mmercial marijuana 
from a felony to a misdemeanor. 
The bill', AB 367 is being sponsored 
by assemblyman Willie Brown (D-
San Francisco) . 

Brown said the bill will simply 
put into law a practice that is 
presently occurring in the courts. 
People are being given 
misdemeanor fines for growing 
small amounts of marijuana even 
though it is a felony punishable by 
imprisonment. 

In 1975 the state Legislature 
passed a law (SB 95, Moscone) 
which reduced the penalty for 
possessing small amounts of 
marijuana to a misdemeanor, but 
the penalty for growing it was not 
reduced, and remained a felony. 

People who grow their own 
marijuana are ultimately being 
prosecuted for a misdemeanor, 
Brown said. But they still have to 
pay a felony ' bail of as much as 
$2500 and they still have a felony 
charge on their record. AS 387 
would rectify UUa, be Mid. 

Brown added several com-

promise amendments to his bill to 
get it through the committee. As 
amenciP.d the bill would make 
g rowing from one to three 
marijuana plants per household a 
misdemeanor punishable by a 
traffic-like citation of $100. 
Growing four to six plants would be 
a misdemeanor punishable by a 
$500 fine and up to six months in 
jail. Growing more than six plants 
for sale would be a felony 
punishable by imprisonment as it 
is under present law. 

Michael Franchetti of the State 
Attorney General's office said that 
passage of the bill "is going to put 
more and more marijuana in 
California and more and more 
people are going to use it. It 

The bill would also make the use 
of marijuana more socially ac-
ceptable and would reduce the 
fear of adver e effects and con-
sequences of its use, he said. 

Franch tti said recent surveys 
prove that reducing marijuana 
penahi s leads to an increase in its 
use . Hll said Field polls taken 
before and after the 1975 Mos('one 
law was passed show an increase 
of SO percent in the number of aduh . 
CalifonUani who UI8 marijuana

law probably did not lead to the

T ay-Sachs Prevention Program 
To End Free Testing Today 
. This is the last day of testing on the campus of UCSD for adult carrier 
detection of Tay-Sachs Disease. Nurses, doctors and trained genetic 
counselors will be on hand for testing and counseling at the Muir Com-
muter Lounge, from 9 am to 5 pm for all students, faculty and staff on the 
campus. . 

Prevention and control of this genetic illness, which affects infants of 
Jewish parents and other populations of Eastern European descent can 
be done by a simple blood test. If both parents are found to be carriers, 
then they run a one in four chance that each pregnancy will result in a 
Tay-Sachs child. 

The California Tay-Sachs Disease Prevention Program, is a prototype 
model study for the prevention and control of genetic disease when those 
methods become available. 

I suggest that people with questions pertaining to this genetic illness or 
other familial problems are welcomed to stop by and discuss the matter 
with one of the licensed trained counselors. For further information call 
294-5659, the Tay-Sachs Prevention office at University Hospital.

were brilliant, her mind was 
brilliant, the way she reached out 
to students was brilliant. At some 
levels, she was almost too good to 
be true. On the last day of class, we 
gave her a thWlderous and tearful 
ovation. She stood very quietly and 
with great dignity as waves of 
applause surrounded her. Her face 
on that day still haWlts me. 

Although I am fond of literature, 
I vowed never to take a literature 
course again. Dozens and dozens of 
other students have been 
boycotting the literature depart-
ment for the same reason. 
Recently I heard that the literature 
department was hurting and that 
class registration was low. 

When the literature department 
voted against Widmer, they voted 
for low registration. They got what 
they wanted, namely an i,ndifferent 
department, with few who care to 
stimulate the students. But we, the 
student body, did not get what WE 
want. We want the university to 
bring back Eleanor Widmer. We 
miss and need and constantly 
regret the loss of Eleanor the 
Divine.

Low Upkeep 
For his plant Smith cited low upkeep, inexpensive labor ("grad 

students can do the work as a master thesis,") and relatively inexpensive 
materials ("if one tower craps out it's no big deal"). " The design would 
use materials we are willing to pay for," stated Smith, hitching up his 
pants in an effort to control his increasingly sloppy appearance - the 
result of his vociferollll demonstrating making him a picture of increasing 
entropy. "The key is to minimize the mirror costs," he added. 

After going through the economics of his plant, Smith concluded that it 
could produce energy at the rate of three cents per kilowatt hour (kwh). 
Because of this relatively low cost, Smith claims that his plant could 
provide the "cheapest source of new electricity." Smith said that it costs 
" four cents per kwh for oil just as fuel not including the power plant 
costs." He also added that he has "no Idea of what nuclear expenditures 
per kwh could be." . . 

In comparing other sources of energy to his plant, Smith claimed that 
the "deconunissioning cost" of his plant would be practically not~, 
"Just lock the gate on the plant and leave it," he said. "For m,lclear It 
costs one to 10 million to decommission a plant," Smith added. Smith also 
discussed the costs of handling dangerous radioactivity, both "short 
lived" (5,000 years) and "long lived" (100,000 years) . He didn't even 
begin to calculate the actual costs involved. 

For his plant Smith claimed that one doesn't have to dig up coal or 
destroy a "valley like Hetch Hetchy". He complained that we are using 
coal for the "wrong uses", " If you have a finger, you don't eat it," he 
commented. "Coal is a good chemical, keep it for cbemicals," he 
suggested. " We are being stupid in our destruction of our resources." 

, "Maldag Climate Worse" 
Smith also stated that every other source of energy, including oil and 

nuclear power plants, produce waste heat that is "making the earth 
hotter and the climate worse." Apparently Smith's plant would produce a 
small amount of waste heat or none altogether.

According to Brosnan, the 
program brings many other 
benefits. The participants who 
attend regular UCSD classes ac-
tually inspire learning and create 
interest in the classroom. "Older 
people can talk about things like 
the depression and the 19308 
because they actually were there. 
To the YOWlger students, what was 
formerly an abstraction, now in 
effect becomes a reality. The 
details enrich the classroom ex-
perience. This exchange affects 
both the older people, who learn 

about contemporary attitudes, as 
well as students, who in turn learn 
more about other ideas. 

" :I'his closes the generation gap 
and we want more young people in 
our classrooms. The students that 
attend are really amazed at what 
we come up with. This is the ideal 
opportunity for young people to get 
together with us in a different kind 
of classroom experience." 

uam students as well as all 
retired citizens are encouraged to 
contact Doris Brosnan in the ex-
tension office or at 452-3409 for 
further infonnation.

Rock Sleeping With IlMAD 'LOVE" 

By Tim MacKeazie 
Arts Editor 

Mad Love - Golden Earring, MCA 
I still can't understand why this Dutch band hasn't at-

tained superstar status. With the strong combination of 
Barry Hay's vocals and George KooymalL'l guitar flash, 
Golden Earring has exported some of the smoothest stuff 
this side of Heinekens. 

While Mad Love doesn't contain a monster, commercial 
appeal song like Moontan's " Radar Love," it has more 
continuity. It just happens to fit together, something not 
entirely true of last years To The Hllt. 

These guys aren't tulips in disguise, they' re top-notch 
rockers. Mad Love has its share, of which "I Need Love" 
and " Mad Love's Comin' " are the creme de la creme. 
"Bombay" is Golden Earring's grandoise, epic rocker, 
reminiscent of Led Zep's "Kastunir." 

Ghost Writer - Garland Jeffreys, A&M 
Garland Jeffreys must definitely be ' considered among 

the foremost of today's singer/songwriters, based upon his ' 
effort called Ghost Writer. He has that street-tough quality 
of Bruce Springsteen, but manages to vary his styles to· 
prevent the dreaded " rock-redundancy." 

YOUR 

"Rough and Ready" perfectly sets the album off 
track : 

Sick sick of takin' a back seat-
Takin' a back street 
Playing it cool 
I'm sick sick sick of bein' mistreated 
Bein'defeated 
And playing the fool 
I'm rough and ready· 
·Copyright 1977 Garland Jeffreys Music (ASCAP) 
Jeffreys' styles include rock and blues, in 8<ldlitio. 

pretty respectable dabble into reggae with "I 
Your Kind." Watch out, GbOllt Writer Jeffreys

'Rock and roll is just one of those businesses that 

gets into fads. Right now, for instance, punk-rocks 
are a dime a dozen. There wouldn't be enough

An Inside Look at "Musto " 

Hool~er Expose Not Too Reveolif.1g 
by Margaret Hewey 

Staff Writer 
When the buzzer rings, the girls 

come out of their small, gaudy 
bedrooms. They immediately head 
for the lobby in skimpy bikinis, 
their faces painted and their hair 
teased to perfection. A custome-:.,is 
waiting. 

They line up, smile, and sound 
off their names - Libra , Tiger, 
Gypsy, Chi Chi, etc . The man 
studies and sizes them up, his eyes 
linger on each possibility. " Will 
you please make your choice, sir, 
the girls get tired of standing," 
says the uniformed maid who 
greets customers at the door. He 
finally picks one and they head for 
a back room. 

The routine is a standard one at 
the Mustang Bridge Ranch, a legal 
whorehouse about eight miles east 
of Reno. It claims to be the largest 
in the country and is owned by Joe 
Conforte, known by many as "the 
brothel czar." Thanks to Robert 
Guralnick, a young filmmaker who 
spent some time on the ranch, we 
can witness the inside world of 
Conforte's brothel on celluloid. 

The result is Mustaag, a candid 
production about actual peopleilnd 
events. Although it is rated X and 
advertised along with the other 
"adult movies," the film is not a 
porno feature. Yet it can't really be 
classified as a structured 
documentary. It's more of a 
cinema verite presentation, un-
structured and with no real 
direction. 

The assortment of scenes record 
detail which unsurprisingly convey 
the ranch as a lucrative as well as 
dehumanizing business. But for 
those who have always wondered 
how a brothel works, what it looks 
like, what exactly goes on -
Mustang can be interesting. 

First of a ll, the ranch comes 
across as more of a prison than a 
glamorous whorehouse, in the 
opening scenes. It consists of a 
complex of mobile homes 
surrounded by a tall chain link 
fence and a few security guards. 

Inside, the girls work a grueling 
12-14 hour schedule and must abide 
by the strict house rules as well as 
stay on duty -for three-week 
periods. Their " business" rooms 
are garish and cramped, doubling 
as sleeping areas. 

How well do the girls profit 
finanCially ? This is never really 
mentioned in the film, but the 

minimum price is ten dollars -
" Prices the working man can 
afford," boasts Conforte. One. girl 
said that she turned 40 tricks a day 
when she was doing well. " You 
begin to lose count after 40," she 
said. 

The actual bedroom scenes 
between the prostitutes and 
customers are not erotic or por-
nographic . They are about ilS 
adventurous as trips to a doctor for 
a medical che kup. The whole 
process comes across as routine 

and matter of fact . Although there 
is nudity, we are denied the 
graphic details. 

Many of the scenes in Mustang 
are directed toward the fat, cigar-
smoking Conforte. His larger than 
life image on the screen (I.e. 
gregarious thug with a taste for 
loud suits, big diamonds and flashy 
cars ) is apparently the real Joe 
Conforte. According to filmmaker 
Guralnick - "He's a showman. In 
fact he was flattered when I told 
him he made Marlon Brando look 
like a wasp." 

Always the astute businessman, 
Conforte was pleased that

Guralnick wanted to do a film 
about his ranch. ':He just loves the 
publicity that Mustang is giving his 
establishment," says Guralnick. 
The publicity may help increase 
business, but on the other hand, 
might hinder it. While viewing the 
film I heard someone say, " It's 
enough to make you want to give 
up sex." 

It is surprising that Conforte 
would want himself filmed so 
closely. Although his prison record 
and illegal dealings are not 
mentioned in the film, it's not 
difficult to despise him. The 
camera records such unflattering 
scenes as - Conforte flashing a 
conspicuous wad of bills out to pay 
for his daughter's Fiat, talking 
about his business while porking 
out at his dining table, and making 
a fool of his aging father . 

At a recent UCSD sneak preview 
of Mustang, Producer-Director 
Guralnick as well as former 
Mustang prostitute Buffy Wilson 
were on hand to promote the film. 

Guralnick said that it cost a 
mere 300,000 dollars to make the 
film. He revealed that he cut ex-
penses by using one hand held 
camera most of the time, blowing 
16mm film up to 35mm film and 
utilizing available room lights. 
"Don't believe what they tell you in 
film school." he said. 

Wilson, who is promoting the 
film as well as writing a book about 
her experiences, said that she left 
the ranch after Guralnick finished 
filming. "At first we thought he 
was an FBI man and wondered 
what he was up to. But after the 
first six weeks we accepted him 
and he started to blend into the 
scenery more. " In person, Wilson 
looked more like an elementary 
school teacher than a former 
prostitute. She said that watching 
the film "made it seem all too real 
for me once more." 

Mustang is certainly not a very 
innovative or well-rounded 
presentation of the world's oldest 
profession. All those expecting to 
see a structured documentary on 
prostitution will be disappointed as 
well as those expecting to see a 
porno film. Guralnick expressed 
hopes that the film would attract 
others besides the porno crowd. 
He 's going to enter it in the Cannes 
Film Festival this summer. It will 
be interesting to see if his project 
succeeds in getting offthe g(ound_ 

Now playing at Mann's State 
Theater.
