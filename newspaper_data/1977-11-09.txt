v-c search committee 
still deliberating 
Behind closed doors, members Indicate 
support for Armitage of Ohio State 

by Mark Stadler 
Members of the Vice-chancellor of Student Affairs Search 

Committee, in a closed-door meeting Monday, indicated strong 
support for Richard Armitage of Ohio Sta.te for the vice-
chancellorship, the Triton Times has learned. 

In a straw vote taken at the Monday meeting, a majority of the 
committee members also supported Melvin Bernstein of UC 
Irvine and Edward Shaw of UCLA, according to sources clo e to 
the search committee. 

The search committee, which meets today to hash out its final 
recommendations for Chancellor McElroy, Monday also received 
reommendations from a group of undergraduates and graduate 
students who met with all seven finalists for the vice-chancellor 
post. 

Excellent-unqualified • 
The student group ranked the candidates from " excellent" to 

" unqualified. " The list - a copy of which was obtained by the 
Triton Times - placed Armitage at the top, with an "excellent" 
ranking. 

He was followed , in order, by David Bell of Fresno State, 
Bernstein, Associate Vice-chancellor of Student Affairs Rick 
Whitehill , Shaw, Charles McClure of UCLA and Assistant to the 
Vice-chancellor of Academic Affairs Tom Hull. 

Whitehill , though, according to sources had strong support from 
several students, and from the four college deans, who made a 
separate recommendation to the search committee . 

Whoever McElroy finally selects for the position will replace 
George Murphy, who resigned from the Student Affairs helm in 
April. 

At that time, McElroy appointed Physical Education Chairman 
Howard Hunt to temporarily replace Murphy . The Chancellor 
then appointed a search committee, comprised of undergraduate 
students, administrators, faculty and staff members, to make a 
nationwide search for Murphy's successor. 

Whitehill's support 
Of the two candidates from UCSD, only Whitehill garnered any 

support in the search committee's straw vote, according to 
sources. 

Whitehill was supported by approximately one-quarterof the 12-
member committee, the sources said. However, one committee 
member reportedly said Whitehill will be among those candidates 
recommended to McElroy, because of his ' ' long service to UCSD. II 

Armitage, the sources said, impressed members of both the 
search committee and the student group because of his candor. 

Don Strebel , a graduate student member of the student 
committee, said he'd talked to members of the search committee 
and that, " Armitage said all the things everybody wanted to hear, 
that Student Affairs is a mess and needs to be cleaned up. " 

Strebel said Armitage "described himself as a change-person 
who makes waves, somebody who comes in, perceives needed 
changes and then follows through." 

Strebel's remarks were confirmed by one source, who said 
Armitage impressed the student committee because he was the 
only candidate who wasn 't a "chameleon. He was the only one who 
said the same things to the students that he said to the search 
committee ."

Nuclear teach-in: Small crowd, large message 
by Laura Richter 

News Editor 
" You all have a common 

goal: life witho.ut fear, II 
emphasized Herbert Marcuse 
in a final emotional appeal 
du ring his speech at the 
Nuclear Power Teach-In held 
Sunday on campus. 

It was fear , that fear ot 
possible nuclear catastrophe, 
which prompted a handful of 
UCSD students , the UCSD 
Clamshell Alliance, to organize 
the teach-in. 

Daniel Ellsberg, nuclear 
arms abolition advocate, and 
Peter Faulkner, author of "The 
Silent Bomb," were featured 
speakers at the afternoon 
event. 

Promoted in ' the series of 
speeches, films and worksbops 
were the possible alternatives 
to nuclear power. Out of the 
barrage of technical infonna-
tion, one fact rose clearly in the 
minds of the sparse 100 persons 
who attended the panel 
speeches: the University of 
california bas developed every 
nuclear weapon ever produced 
in America. 

Diane Thomas 01 the UC 
Weapons Lab Conversio' 
Project, which belan 15 months 
8,0 to "try and develop a 
sustained campai,n a,ainst 

• nuclear power," spoke of the 

UC committee which had been 
appointed to review the 
Universfty ' s role at the 
Lawrence Livermore -Los 
Alamos Laboratories. Thomas 
pointed to professor Herbert 
York of UCSD as the campus' 
committee representative , 
saying that a conversion to 
solar power research at the 
labs would have to be encour-
aged through contact with the 
committee. 

Ellsberg knocked the Carter-
Schlesinger policy, which he 
says relies heavily on nuclear 
power. In making a " practical 
goal" of the abolition, he felt it 
imperative that "we must use 
all the methods effective and 
essential to ending the Vietnam 
War - letter writing, lobbying 
and non-violent civil disobed-
ience." 

When asked to comment on 
C-arter'~ Saturday veto of the 
breeder reactor, Ellsberg said 
that the particular veto, while 
welcome, was one of the few 
acta that has been made to 

uphold the President's cam-
paign promises. . 

Community action 
Outlining a 12 month pro-

gram organized by a coalition 
of UC anti-nuclear power 
groups, Ellsberg refered to 
"commu nit y actio n and 
organization, II as well as a civil 
disobedience demonstration at 
the United Nations General 
Assembly. "None of this will 
solve our problems. Whether or 
not our children are alive in 
the n xt generation depends on 
the outcome of t hi s move-
ment. " 

Subject to ElIsberg's most 
pointed c riti cis m were the 
workings of the Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission 
(NRC). " The NRC operates in a 
way that mocks its name," he 
stated, continuing that evi-
dence has shown that Pacific 
Gas and Electric (PGE) and 
the Energy Research Develop-
ment Agency (ERDA - newly 
named the Department of 
EnerllY) work through an 

avantageous position with the 
NRC. "In short, the publi :: is i 
no way being protected. 

"Those persons who are 
behind the development 0 
nuclear power live in the dark 
caves of the uncon ciousnes 
and scream when they see the

Coast Cruiser continues to 
cruise up to North County 

by Mary O'Connor 
Slatr Writer 
Wh~tever happened to the 

Coast Cruiser, the student-
operata! bus which used · to 
shurfle students to and rrom 
North County ror only 25 cen ts a 
trip? Well , surprise - it's still 
around, although in a slightly 
reduced rorm. 

For eight years, until spring 
quarter of last year, the Coast 
Cruiser made nine runs per day 
and was the oply bus that UCSD 
students could take between 
school and North County . 
Dur'ng spring quarter , 
however, San Diego buses 
extended their runs to reach 
15th Street in Del Mar. There, 
students could transfer onto 
North County buses. The Coast 
Cruiser was expected to be 
rendered useless by this new 
arrangement, and at the end of 
last year it was announced that 
this year Cruiser would be DO 

more . Over the summer 
someone realized that the lut 
city bus ran at about 6: 3Opm, 
and anyone wiahlq to spend 
the eveniDl at lab or library 
might be without a ride. Hence 
the Cruiser was reinstated for 
evening runs. 

This quarter the Cruiser 
leaves Matthews Campus (by 
the Medical School) , stops in 
rront or Urey Ha1l, AP&M, and 
Third College , and heads 
northward three times each 
evening Monday through 
Thursday. at eight, nine and 10. 
As or Nov. 6, there will be an 
additional three runs every 
Sunday evening. Sunday runs 
will exist only until Dec. 4 
unless ridership is large enough 
to warrant their continuation. 

The Cruiser takes the PacUic 
Coast Highway north as far as 
La Costa Blvd. The driver will 
stop anywhere along the route 
that is requested and will even

make short detours to deliver 
someone to his or her door. 

On the way back to UCSD, the 
Cruiser takes Interstate 5. 
Riders for UCSD should 
therefore flag the bus down as it 
travels northward. 

Although the Cruiser is 
basically the same, student-
operated and still only a 
quarter to ride it is much 
changed in appearance . 
According to Barry Beckham 
in the Orr-Campus Housing 
OUire, "In previous years, the 
school rented a 44-passenger 
bus rrom Aztec Bus Lines. Now 
we use a 12·passenger van rrom 
the UCSD motor-pool. We're 
trying to get something bigger, 
because our night runs are 
usually near or full capacity." 

Randy Erickson, one of the 
rour regular student drivers, 
says that he expects the Cruiser 
to get very crowded over finals 
week .

(Continued rrom page 6) 
Halperin is aiming ror a time 

of forty minutes (5: 20 to 5: 30 
per mile), which he says "will 
put me in the top half or the 

, finishers ." The favorite in the 
race is Jerome Drayton , 
Canada's premier runner, who 
placed firth in the marathon at 
the 1976 Montreal OlympiC 
Games . Leaving today fo r 
Montreal (where he will stay 
with relatives) , Halperin is 
paying for the entire trip by 
himself.

A I un to Canada 
UCSD'S~'rd seeded cross 

country DOer baa told the 
Triton TiJ be will bypau the 
NAJA District Three Cbam~ 
ionsbiPl tIlis Saturday. In a 
telepbone interview, Jon 
Halperin stated be baaeamed a 
spot on tbe University of 
Toronto Track Club and will 
compete for them in the 
Canadian Nationals, ' also 
scbedlilled for SatlLlrdllY 

co..try ra._r Jo. 
H ....... . 

Halperin , a junior from 
Encino, California, holds dual 
citizenship with the United 
States and Canada , which 
allows him to run for Toronto. 
Triton cross country runner 
Andy Skeil was upset at 
Halperin' s decision and noted 
that his absence will cost UCSD 
several points in this weekend 's 
NAIA meet in La Mirada. 

Works out in Canada 
During the past summer, 

Halperin worked out with the 

Toronto Club (wbicb is actually 
a team but maintains club 
status to lain additional funds 
from tbe Canadian lovern-
meat) and impressed the new 
coacll eooup to let bim run for 
U of T at the Nationals in Hull, 
Quebec. Toronto's top seven 
runners will compete at Hull 
while the top ten or fifteen 
Canadian finishers will qualify 
for the World Competition in 
Europe next Spring. 

For UCSD , Halperin has 
consistently placed in the top 
three team spots in dual meets 
and has a personal best of 27: 30 
on UCSO's tough 5 .3 mile 
course. 

The Canadian meet, how-
ever, will be a much stiffer 
challenge for Halperin. The 
Hull course is 12,000 kilometers 
(71h miles) , running over hill 
after hill . Since the race is run 
in mid-November, tempera-
tures are expected to be near 
freezing with some snow on tfie 
ground during competition. 

" I run best at forty degrees," 
Halperin observed, "but I've 
been training at night with 
heavier clothes to prepare for 
the race." The Canadian race 
will necessitate different 
running attire (turtleneck shirt 
and sweat pants) as well as 
becoming acclimated quickly 
to the weather factor.

it turned around just in time to 
see the ball roll into the open 
goal.

With the wind agatnst them, 
the Tritons had trouble getting 
the ball out of their end of the 
field in the first half. Ramirez 
notched his first goal en route a 
hat trick on a free kick when he 
powered a 25 footer past a 
diving Healy at the ten minute 
mark. Without the aid of a stiff 
gust of wind, Healy could have 
made the save. 

John Kalenda put the Tritons 
out in front on a penalty kick 
fifteen minutes into the second 
half. Gold was foulded near the 
net and when the penalty kick 
was assessed, coach Stewart 
Hayes called on Kalenda, his 
strongest kicker, to attempt the 
shot.

thirteen minutes later and fired 
it from twenty feet straight on

the game.

tJCSO got even as Jonathan 
Gold blasted a loose ball into

minutes left in the half. 

The Triton offense, tired by 
constant aggressive play in 
both halves, fell apart late in 
the second half and called on 
their defense to bail them out. 
As the minutes ticked away, 
play by both teams became 
more ragged, and at one point, 
resembled a rugby match with 
several players diving and 

lis the shots. Fresno Paciric had put heavy ca pressure on Triton goalie Brian 
Healy, who came out of his goal 
box to bat away a loose ball in 
front of the net. When the ball 
popped up into the air in the 
middle of a crowd of players, 
Ramirez jumped up and

Harry 8COrei 5 In 1081 
Arizona upends Tritons, 11-7 

by SIeve Gould 
Sports Edi&or 

UCSO's waterpolo team 
members knew they had to play 
nationally ranked University of 
Arizona even for the entire 
game if they wanted to have 
a ny chance of upsettng the 
visiting Wildcats. 

Three of the four periods 
were closely contested, but a 
strong second 'period by 
Arizona enabled them to 'down 
the Tritons, 11-7 Friday 
afternoon before a capacity 
crowd at the Natatorium. 

Hllb «oring opener 
For the first half of the 

opening ei,ht minute stanza , 
12th ranked Arizona controlled 
the ball but UCSO matched 
them goal for goal. 

After the Wildcats tallied 
with Mark GQrdon in penalty 
box, Dan Eby evened the score 
on a penalty shot. Eby scored 
again to knot it at two but 
Arizona's Stan Ch/lsS con-
nected for his second of fou r 
goals during the game to make 
it 3-2. David Harry then scored 
twice to pull UCSO even. 

Alei in the net 
Arizona threatened to blow 

the game wide open in the 
second period Dut Bob Alei 
made several fine saves to keep 
the score close. Alei stopped a 
shot on a two on one fastbreak 
and then way out of the net on 
another fastbreak to break up a 
potential goal. 

The Tritons fired cine shots 
on the Wildcats in the second 
period but a lack of movement 
a llowed the visitors, who 
combined a tight defense with 
ba ll control , to hold UCSD 
scoreless in the period and take 
a 7-4 halftime lead. 

Offense sputters 
Trying to work for better shot 

se lection, UCSD's offens e 
sputtered in the third period, 
and until Harry scored midway 
through the period to close the 
gap to 8-5, the Tritons had gone 
over twelve minutes without a 
goal. Even with man advant-

rolli ng on the dirt-trodden 
Matthews East Field. 

UCSD's season, ended by the 
defeat, was one of question. One 
unidentified Triton player 
noted "We only win when we 
have to:" the adage couldn ' t 
have been more appropriate for 
UCSD. In non-league games, 
the Tritons went 0-8-1 (includ-
ing All-Cal and plaYQff games)'. 
They compiled a 3-1 record in 
league action. 

The Fresno Pacific finale 
was another must win situation 
but the Jaime Ramirez show 
denied UCSD the opportunity to 
advance to the second round of 
the NAIA playoffs and forced 
tea m members to look for 
another saying .. . one for the 
1978 season.

ages twice in the period, UCSD 
couldn't penetrate the tough 
Wildcat's man to man deCense. 

Turnoven burt 
Needing a big fourth period, 

the Tritons lost tbe ball four 
consecutive times on turnovers 
while Arizona wIdened its lead 
to 10-5 on a pair of goals by 
Chass. 

Harry then tallied twice for 
his fourth and fifth goals of the 
game to narrow the Wildcat's 
cushion to 10-7. 

But Arizona played keep-
away for the final two minutes 
and added an insurance goal to 
ruin the Triton 's hopes of ' 
scoring a big upset. 

Good sbowinl 
Despite the loss , which put 

UCSD's season record at 10-6, 

Harry's offensive output and 
Alei's goal keeping against a 
strong team were superb. 

The Tritons must now look 
ahead to a busy week, as they 
face San Diego State in a 
grudge match this afternoon at 
UCSD, travel to UC Riverside 
Friday and battle nationa lly 
fifth rated Pepperdine back at 
UCSD on Saturday.

TCF is not a social group, 
emphasized Roy . But an 
integral part of Christianity is 
to get to know people - being 
with others. " The proof of being 
Christian is if you love others. If 
you don 't, you aren' t," he said. 

Rough times face the organi-

been eliminated next quarter 
as a result of UC's a~plication 
of the separation of church and 
state principle to its student 
organizations.
