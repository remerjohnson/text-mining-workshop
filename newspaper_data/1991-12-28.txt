The increainpy crucial topic of 
whcIber or not the University of 
CIIifomia should place more em-
pbMiI on reICII'Ch or IIeaChina was 
the c:enIrIl focus of November's 
AcademicSenllcmeelinaIatTues-
day. 

OwqltorRichiud Alkinson, in 
his IIIDUal stalC-Of-dM>university 
address, described the naDonaI de-
_ between research and teIChina 
in universities as Ma very worrisome 
problem. .. but he spoke positively 
on UCSD's sua:ess in boch areas. 

Referrina to the studalt to fac-
ulty and staff ratio, Atkinson noted 
that underfonnerCalifomia Gover-
nor Ronald Reapn. a strong advo-
care of biah quality teaching in the 
UC systIm. UCSD averqed 14.5

member. 

Currently, with 17 years of 
growth in enrollment and two addi-
tional colleges, UCSD's stucte.-
staff/facuIly I'I&io is only 17.6 to 1.

AIkinson is confident that 20 new 
professors can be himl. he said he 
could not JU8IIDleC that the univer-

Atkinson also addressed the 
UCSD budpt aisis. 

MLIst year's budget was carty a 
disaster for the University of Cali-

Atkinson. 

Atkinson warned that in January 
Governor Wilson may ask the Cali-

yearbudgetc:onection, which could 
include an.:ross-the-board cutback 
severely affecting the UC.

What is the UC's Future? 
• The 40% fee hike was just the beginning, with 
more increases and possible enrollment cuts expected 
By J8IOII Snell 
Senior Staff Writer 

ClIanceUor Richard Atkinson's 
hints of impending financial trouble 
for UCSD last Tuesday were just 
the latest in a series of warnings 
about the future of the University of 

NEWS ANALYSIS 
CalittJnia. . 

Both the university's adminis-
trators and student groups have in-
dicaIed that the next decade could 
bring massive fee increases that 
might make the UC the most expen-
sive public school system in the 

country and could eliminate the ex-
istence of lower-division students. 

In mid-November, UCPresident 
David Gardner warned the UC Re-
gents that the university might have 
to impose tuition on all students 
beginning in the 1992-93 school 
year. Currently, in-state undergradu-
ates pay approximately $2.500 in 
fees each year. 

Forcing all students to pay tu-
ition does not mean that California 
residents would pay the same 
amount of money as non-resident 
students. Instead, all students -

Stingley Completes 300-Mile 
Bike Trip to Benefit UCSD's DSU

Against 30 mph winds and cold Novem-
ber WCItber,UCSD alumnus Shawn Stinpey 
biked 300 miles last week toraiseover$2,OOO 
for the UCSO's Disabled Student Union 
(DSU). 

Stingley, a 1991 Third College gradwue. 
rode his bike for 34 hours beginnina Nov. 23, 
from Morro Bay to UCSD, on what was 
originally intended to be a 24-hour trip. 

"The first day was beautiful, but once the 
sun went down. the Santa Ana winds picked 
up. At Point Mugu, around 1 a.m., the winds 

were so strong that ~ one point I was blown 
to a standstill," Stingley said. 

At the I 82-mile mark, Stingley said, his 
parents and his roommate Mike Testa urged 
him to rest until dawn. He said he slept in 
Long Beach early Sunday morning, and at 
around 6 a.m. continued his ride. 

Stingley's final time was 34 hours and 41 
minutes. 

Stingley proposed the fundraiser as a 
way to raise public awareness and funds for

Blame, .... WiIIoD 
While studaa have tended to 

direct Iheir anaer over fee and III-
itioo iI.aasea _ the UC Rcpots, 
Uoiversity of California Student 
Asaocillioo (UCiA) Vice Prcsi-
deal John EdIon said dill the true 
bIIme lies with the state govern-
ment. 

,,(StudenIs] sbouId direct Iheir 
fears to the state," Edson said. "Sill-
dents and the rqenas ... are in the 
same boll together. Unless [the ~ 
scots) startclosioadowohospillls, 
they can't reaUy do much. .. 

"1bc governor fon:ea the UC to 
loot like the villain," Edson said. 
"[He] will undcn;ut the UC by bun-
dreds of millions of dollars, fon:ing 
the (regents] to raise fees." 

Rumors of possible ways the 
university could save money range 
from shutting down some univer-
sity-run hospitals to cutting off all 
state funding for UC Berkeley and 
Ua..A. 

Edson says that ifGovemor Perc 
Wilson attempted to cut offfunding 
for those IWO campuses, the entire 
UC system would feel its effects. 

"UCBerkeley andUa.A won't 
be privatized," Edson said. "The 
governor would make his recom-
mendation (for UC fimding] based 
on the remaining seven campuses, 
and then the UC would redistribute 
that money among all nine." 

In essen::e, such a move would 

simply force the UC 10 fund nine 
C8IqJUICS for the. price of seven. 

Another pcaible cm.ae in the 
UC aystan, IICCOIdiu& to Edson, 
would be 10 ellminale Iower-Gvi-
lion CXIUI'SeL 

"'Tbe ooIy pt.le dill would be

would be the c:ommuoity colleges," 
Bdsoo said. "You'd go somewh= 
for two yem dleaply, save up your 
money ,and then ao toa Cal State or 
UC ac:bool, depending on how well 
youdo." 
, He iDdicaled thai such an idea is 

hlR:lJy a wilclrumor, bec:auae itaune 
"directly from the bead of the de-
partmer.tof6nance intbc governor's 
offic:e." 

ThII same state financial officer, 
Edson said, mentioned the possibil-
ity of privatizing UC Berkeley and 
Ua.A. 

1be Michipn Example 
In trying to fmd ways to make 

cuts, the UC Regents have looked at 
what happened when a state finan-
cial crisis forced major funding cuts 
II the University of Michigan. 

Michigan is currently the most 
expensive public school in thecoun-
try, with in-state undergraduate stu-
dmts at UM's main campus in Ann 
Arbor paying approximarely $4,000 
in tuition each year, according to 
Wooo Lee, an associ8le director at 
UM's News and Information Ser-
vices Office. 

In the past five years, state fund-
ing for the University of Michigan 
has increased by 16 percent, while 
student tuition has jumped by 42 
percent 

Butthesituation in Michiganhas 
been one of gradual chan~e, rather 

The U,CSD Guardian 

than tbeextreme financial problems 
f.:ed in CaIifomia. Though fund-
ingblSo't kept up with inflaIion. the 
SIBle ofMicbigan has still managed 

" The governor forces the 
UC to look like the vi~ 

lain ... [He] will undercut 
the UC by hundreds of 

millions of dollars, forcing 
the [regents] to raise 

fees. 

" JOHN EDSON UCSA Vice President 
to increase funding to the univer-
sity. 

Last year's UCbudget, however, 
actually contained a cut of$2.2 mil-
lion in funding from the previous 
year, and UC students faced a 40 
percent fee increase in one year, 
rather than the five-year time frame 
given to UM students. 

Edson said thai the economic 
downturn in Michigan, while sutr 

slantia), was somewhat more 
gradual than the problems thathave 
hit California. 

MFrom what we're bearing, 
whll's happening here is unique to 
Califomia,"hesaid. "Overall, higher 
education institutions have had ... 
slight increases in funding." 

The 1992-93 UC budget pro-
posed by the UC Regents includes 
whll Gardner calls a "reasonable 
and modest" increase of $211.7 
million overtbis year. But. Gardner 
said. "the stile is not in a position to 
fund it We have received this mes-
sage unequivocally ... [from) the 
Depanment of Fmance." 

Finding Ways to Save 
Facing no increase and pemaps 

evenanothercut in funding, Gardner 
and the regents face some tough 
decisions in choosing how to keep 
the university afloat. and having 
students pay more isn't enough in 
itself. 

"Fee increasesdon 'tgenerare that 
much revenue," Edson said. "Last 
year's increase only raised an addi-
tional90 million dollars," 

With the regents adamantly 
against cutting pay increases for 
faculty members, the other likely 
avenue of cost savings is enroll-
ment cuts. 

"If state funding and student fee 
income... prove inadequate," 
Gardner told the regents, "then we 
will have only one altemative left 
and that is reducing enrollments to 
match available resources .... In all 
of our past fiscal difficulties, we 
have never done this." 

Edson emphasized that while 
cutting the numberofstudents at the 
university would be the easiest way 
.. 

NEWS 3 

to save large mounts of money, he 
warned that it would be a dangerous 
idea. 

"The most tragic [money-saver] 
would be to cut back on the number 
of students," Edson said "If we 
start cutting admissions, then this 
ceases to be a public institution." 

A Blow to Diversity? 
Another unforeseen problem 

caused by enrollment cuts could be 
the heightening of racial tension 
throughout the UC system. 

"Can you imagine, once we start 
tuming away [straight-A) students, 
how hard it will be to maintain a 
sense of diversity?" Edson said, 
"The Student Affinnative Action 
Committee would heavily pressure 
A.S. and other groups to ... main-
tain affinnative action guidelines 
despite enrollment cuts." 

Edson suggested that such an 
instance, with straight-A students 
being rejected by the university 
while underrepresented students 
were allowed admittance through 
affinnative action plans, could lead 
in the future to a backlash against 
underrepresented students and di-
versity programs. 

Edson cites the potential blow 10 
racial diversity and fair treatment of 
California students who excel in 
high school as reasons why he would 
rather see more fee increases than 
enrollment cuts, 

The UCSA will not take a posi-
tion on the matter. 

However, fee increases carry 
their own set of potentially harmful 
baggage with them,Edson acknowl-
edged.

.. OPINION 

"D:::== IIIe young woman in &oat 
of me asked. My frienda 
and I were conleq)leti"l 

dessert after. wonderful pizza dinneI'. (By 
American sbIndarda, it wu • lousy tw:USe 
for a pizza. but you lam to lower your 
standards quietly hcfe.) We ax:cpted her 
invitation to CUlto the front of the half-
hour line and struck; up a conversation. 
Two days later, we went dancing with 
them, and within a week, we md their 
families. The way we feU into such an easy 
friendship amazes me. but it seems to 
happen with stanJing regularity. 

At first. Russians seem very cold. 
Riding on the metro, I watch the stony 
faces as llley stare right through me. In the 
stores, IIIe sales clerks may or may noc 
harbor a dislike for foreigners, and llley 
treat you accordingly. On the street, IIIe 
only people who arc friendly arc usually 
after your all-valuable hard currency. But 
the coolness hides a warmth reserved for 
one's friends. 

Russians tend to be subtly affectionate 
in public. SlJ'OlIing down the street, many 
people walk in pairs with their arms linked. 
People also tend to le:m on their compan-
ions much of the time when riding on 
public transit. 

It·s a good thing they like to be so close 
because I have ridden on trains and metro 
cars where I was so tightly packed that I 
couldn't help but lean on the person next to 
me. And on the other side. And in front. 
And behind. 

Couples also indulge in public displays 
of affection regularly everywhere - on 
the metro. in the parks and on the street. 
Apparently this situation stems from lack 
of housing. Many families have two or 
more generations in the same mall 
apartment. For those who want privacy, 
the anonymity of a crowded street mt\)' 
offer more freedom than a cramped 
apartment.

iL The Russians, however, accept this 1m a 
r.:t of life. 

In a counay where Ion& Iincs are a Biven 
pen of ewsy day life, waiting4S minutes 10 
buy a food ban is considmId a short wait. 
When I akcd my Russian friend why she 
smoked when she knew it WII unhealthy, 
she shruged and said. "Hard life." 

The Russian attitude distinguishes them 
from tomgncrs in ocher ways. As Ameri-
cans, our carriaae and posture give lIS away 
1m quickly 1m our shop. One of my 
American friends was told by a Russian 
that he "waIb like a free man. " 

The stereoeypicalloud American hits 
especiaUy hard bec:ause the natives IR so 
quiet and subdued. I had to \earn noc to 
smile so much because it instandy identi-
fied me 1m a non-Russian in I sea of somber 
faces. 

Dcspice the faces, lhcrc is 8 sense that 
people here IooIt out for fellow Russians 
I1ICR than Americans look out for each 
other. When I reached the front of the line 
for that wonderful pizza, a total stranger 
started to scold me, saying that I should 
first allow another man at the end of the 
line with a baby go first. After I agreed. the 
young father ordered six pizzas without 
comment to me. And then he left. 

People also surrender seats, either 
voluntarily or by request, on the metro so 
an old babushka can sit down. I realize this 
type of thing also happens in the United 
States, but it seems more conunon here. 
Babushkas receive especially free rein . 
when it comes to ceiling people what to do 
because everyone indulges them. Rumor 
has it. although it is noc yet cold enough to 
test, that those wandering around without 
hats will receive reprimands from the 
babushlcos for noc being properly dressed. 

The Cold War is over, but the differ-
ences remain. In many ways, Russians are 
very similar to Americans. But in even 
more ways, we IR more different than we 
realize.

DIfferent 'Truths' 
About Abortion 
Editor: 

In response to "It's NO! Me They Hate 
-Just My Ideas" (Nov. 18). This was a 
very well-writlal and impassioned c0m-
mentary taking the ~life position on the 
abortion issue. I must say, though, I think 
Miguel Buckenmeyer missed the heart of 
the issue. "When peop1e n:a:t with haImi 
to others, they must be reacting outoffear. 
In this ~, I hope they fear the truth. " 

It is noc the "truth"I fear but the~" 
thai others choose to force upon me. The 
abortion issue is not a black or whille, right 
or wrong controversy. I suggest 10 the 
writerthat the hostile mICtionhehM felt to 
his pro-life staIXe canes from not the fear 
of "truth" - whose 1nIlh? what is the 
truth? - but from the fear of havi"l to 
follow his "truth" which denies everyone 
else's right 10 pursue and detennioe their 
own individual truths. 

The abortion issue is not a question of 
truth but a problem of differing opinions. 
Bccausethisis so,ldonotuodealitald bow 
acoocrcte conclusion such as the stm:eof 
pro-life could be made into law. Right 
now, there is a choice which allows an to 
exacise their individual opinions. The 
anger and fear in this oontrovmy comes 
from tho6e of us who fear that our belicfs 
will someday be denied. 1bcR is 00 righl

SAAC is Back on the Racism Warpath " 
• A recent controversy proves once again that the charge of racism can be a powerful political tool 

The Studenl Affumative Action Commit-
tee has hauled out its racial camons once 
again. This time it has aimed them at the AS. 
Council, and fired away with aIlegatiom of 
racism. The council's crime? II violated the 
old PC adage of never inspecting the creden-
tials of a member of a minority group. SAAC 
iepese.ltative Victor Nieblas applied for a 
position 00 the Registration Fee OOmmittee,

asked him some tough questions.

Considering that Nieblas continually re-

ferred to his extensive involvement in SAAC 
throughout his interview, and avoided discuss-
ing his priorities, one cannot help but wonder 
if something funny is going on here. 

Indeed, it is worth noting that the Reg. Fee 
Committee last year took some funding away 
from SAAC and moved it into Temporary 
Funding. How do you think the young SAAC 
intern Victor Nieblas felt about that? 

All of the evidence seems to point in one 
direction. Nieblas clearly has a SAAC~ri­
ented agenda. Noticing this, council member 
Erik Johnson rerll8Iked. "There could be a 
conflict of inrerest because on the Reg. Fee, 
you're going 10 be reviewing the unit that 
you're goingtobedi.rectly affectc~by. Sol was 
just wondering how you feel about that?" 

''I'm sure it's in the bylaws that I wouldn'l 
be able to vote on a conflict of interest case," 
Nicblas finally answered, "but I would be able 
to provide the information." Or should one say 
"pressure'''] 

Nieblas is going to hav~a strong influence 
on the conunittee and its decisions, reganlless 
of whether or not 'he votes on an issue. 1lle 
committee has a finite amount of money it is 
able to allocate. 1lle more money that goes to 
other projects, the less money SAAC sees. 
Nicblas' actions are tantamounl 10 saying, "I 
won't actually cut myself a piece of the pie. 
Instead, I'll cut everyone else a piece and 
whatever is left over I'U take for myself."

RECYCLE 
ContInued from pa&e 1 
UCSD campus, 

According to PPS Recycle Pro-
g ram Coordinator Bethany 
Gillmore. because of the intensive 
labor involved in the recycling of 
paper, PPS has agreed to help the 
co-op. PPS has taken over paper 
recycling while the efforts of the co-
op are focused on the recycling of 
aluminum and glass. 

Although !he#co-op has been 
somewtuuconcemed about whether 
or not the new program would 
eclipse the Recycling Co-op. 
Gillmore said, "We don't want to 
take away [!he student co-op] o~ 
ponunity in any way, shape or fonn. 
We support it." 

"We want to wortccooperatively 
with !hem. We want Ihem to coo-

!hey do. It is imponartt for !he stu-
dents to be involved in real life 
issues like this. That is !he major 
part of the educational process." 
Gillmore said. 

According to Hurst. "It is an 
enrichment to !he students to run a 
business. espcciaIJ y a recycling busi-
ness." 

Togelher with !he Student Envi-

Stingley said. 

Stingley cites the inaccessibility 
to disabled students of the shuttles, 
campus housing and the Career Ser-
vices Center as just a few eKamples 
of what disabled students must en-
dure on this campus. 

"Even the door to the Disabled 
Siudents Services building is not an 
automatic door. It must be manually 
opened." he said. 

Stingley said he had originally 
hoped to raise S5.000-SlO.000. but 
feels he was a little nai ve going into 
the project. 

"I realized that I could have 
worked at McDonalds for four 
months and made more money than 
I did fundraising," he said. 

DSU President Russ Allen said 
that although the DSU will not be 
able to buy both the Fortress wheel-
chair and the new computer they 
had hoped for. "We will most likely 
be getting [the] new computer as a 
result of the fundraising." 

According to Stingley. the one 
drawback of the fundraising is that 
"the administration may take 20 

NEWS 7 

percent off of the fund raised be-
cause the pledges were solicited on 
campus." 

Although Stingley said he i not 
sure whanheoutcome will be.Allen 
said, "Every cent counts. If we get 
only 80percentoul, that's OK. With-
out the use of the Price Center to get 
the pledges, we wouldn't have gOl· 
ten as many in the first place." 

"I've learned that disabled stu-
dents are just like you and me," 
Stingley -aid of his eKperiences 
WOrking 011 the fundraiser. 

"They have their dreams and 
goals. yet the only unusual barriers 
they face are the social and physical 
barriers we place upon them," he 
added. 

Slingley added that he hopes to 
make his 300-mile bike ride an an-
nual event as a re ponse to poor 
administrative funding for DSU and 
the success of raising awarenes 
about disabled students. 

"I would like to involve all UC 
campuses and raise money for DSUs

these projects are pan of a separare 
stale budaet independent from the 
budaet which governs SlUdent em-
ployee waps aOC - culty salaries. 

The university dOes not have the 
authority to alter these pIanI. 

Alkinson remarked that the bud-
get cuts were affecting morale at 
UCSD, which he predicts will expe-
rience a "low ebb for a long time," 
and he slreSSed the need "to hang 
logetherand appreciate each other's 
problems ... during these tough 
times." 

In addition, Atkinson expressed 
his hope that UC President David 
Gardner will be successful in con-
vincing the California Slate Legis-
lature and Governor Pete Wilson 
that the UCSD faculty has been 
responsible for a very high quality 
of teaChing, und does not neglect 
teachingrespon ibilities for the sake 
of research. 

In fact. student evaluations have 
generally supported Atkinson's 
praise of the UCSD faculty's teach-
ing abilities. 

A 1989 report tudying Course 
and Professor Evaluations 
(C.AP.E.) revealed that an average 
of 81 percent of students recom-
mend their inslIUctor, and nearly all 
tudents hold their UCSD profes-

sors in high esteem. 
Tuesday's Academic Senate 

meeting focused mainly on a report 
by Chemical Physics Professor Katja 
Lindenberg, and a response to 
Lindenberg's report by the Califor-
nia Assessment Program (C.A.P.). 

Lindenberg's report argued that 
placing more emphasis on teaching 

at UCSO will not nccessarily mean 
taking away from UCSO's research 
capabilities. 

In effect, with the right faculty 
and organization, the university 
should not have to sacrifice one for 
die oda, he said. 

Lindenberg proposcdan increase 
in ~wards to professors for aca-
demic activities other than just re-
search. 

However, the C.AP. and many 
of the senators present disapproved 
of any cutbacks in research at UC 
schools. 

C.AP. argued that the "wider 
implication" involved in reducing 
research "might not be right for the 
UC," especially because of the need 
for graduate school enrollment 
growth, contracts and grants and 
meeting the original UC Master 
Plan. 

Atkinson, in his address, pia ed 
an emphasis on the desired growth 
in the number of graduate students 
at UC D, and explained that gradu-
ate program depend heavily on re-
search. 

C.AP.a1soclaimedthatthededi-
cation of a school and its faculty 
toward quality research is a key 
factor in attrncting grad uate students. 

This quarter, graduate tudents 
make up 12 percent of the entire 
UCSD student popu lation. Atkinson 
said he would like to see that per-
centage increase to 25 percent in 
order to match most other major 
research universities and provide 
more teaching assi tants and re-
search assistants for professors. 

C.AP. also expressed concern 
that restricting UCSD research 
would severely limit the school's 
ability to auract income from re-

despite a genenI 10 percent • 
crease in private gifts to die entire 
UC system in 1990-91, UCSO's 
privale funding incmlsed nine per-
cent. 

C.A.P. also argued lhal a ~uc­
tion of UC research contradicts the 
30-year-old CalifomiaMasterPlan, 
which called for the UC to provide 
select undergraduate teaching and 
doctoral education, and to serve as 
thestate's primary research agency. 

The Master Plan provides for a 
stronger emphasis on teaching at 
the Community College level lind 
the California Stllte University 
(CSU) schools. 

Some Academic Senate mem-
bers said they were concerned that if 
the UC were forced to cut research, 
there would no longer be a di tinct 
purpose for having both the UC and 
the CSU y terns. 

In addition to the debate on re-
search and teaching, Atkinson's 
state-of-the-campus address in-
cluded updates on many other UCSD 
projects and problems. 

Atkinson acknowledged the 
growth of the UCSD Family Day 
Care Program, and applauded 
UCSD for being selected for impor-
tant new projects such as the Inter-
nationa\Thermonuclear Experimen-
tal Reactor (ITER) project, the 
Ludwig Institute for Cancer Re-
search and Scripps Institute of 
Oceanography's construction and 
operationofa "world-rangingccean 
research" vessel.

model is ineffective to lower-middle and low income students." he 
said. The more a university raises fees and relies on financial aid 
programs to support students, Edson explained, increasing numbers 
of students will fall through the cracks - too poorto pay lheirtuition, 
but not poor enough to qualify for financial assistance. 

Then there is what Edson calls the problem of "sticker-shoclc" -
the idea that needy students and students from underrepresented 
ethnic groups will see the cost of a UC education and nOI even bother 
to apply. 

During its lean years the University of Michigan still managed. 
through what Michigan Daily Editor in Chief Andy Gottesman 
described as "voodoo bookkeeping," to avoid cutting the quality of 
education at the university. If the UC is modeling any part of its 
strategy after Michigan, this would seem to be it. 

But with faculty seemingly untouchable, fees and admissions will 
most likely bear the brunt of the state's budget woes. The UCSA 

refe~ to the 40 percent fee increase announced on Feb. 14 as a 
"Valentine's Day Massacre." In retrospect. however, it seems that 
increase was just the first salvo in a UC fmancial civil war that may 
continue into the next century. It is the university's students who are 
on the front lines of that banle.

J USTAFEWNOTES: • Book the Chicago Bulls as repeat winners of the 
NBA title. Write it in stone. The 
reason? Very simple - Right 23. 

There have been very few 
athletes in the history of spons 
who have either never failed in a 
clutch moment, or have done it so 
infrequently that the public can't 
remember. The latter is some kind 
of feat, considering the spons 
fan's memory for failure. 

Michael Jordan is one of those 
athletes - along with the likes of 
Joe Montana, Larry Bird, Magic 
Johnson, Ronnie LotI. Lawrence 
Taylor and Jerry Rice. 

Audiences don't hope these 
players will come through when 
the pressure is on. 'They know 
these players will come through 
when the pressure is on. 

Even when the Bulls had four 
stiffs (movie title: "Air Jordan 
Visits the Morgue'') around him, 
Jordan had a knack for coming up 
big under 50,000 wan spotlights. 
Who can forget his 63-point 
bonanza against the Celtics? 
Boston won the series, but 
Jordan's air show was all that 
anyone talked about. Or how 
about his jump shot as a North 
Carolina freshman to win the 
NCAA title? 

A NO NOW, Chicago has surrounded him with decent 
players. This is not a fantastic 
starting lineup. No team with Bill 
Cartwright could be. But the 
players are good enough that 
Jordan doesn 't have to carry 
Chicago every night. 

And the team is good enough 
that it can compete with anyone. 

Which leaves the one remain-
ing intangible that, with Magic's 
retirement, no one else can match: 
Michael Jordan. 

• Bill Walsh's autobiogmphy 
Building a Champion should be 
required reading for any business 
major or future corporate lackey. 

He has more insights about 
how to manage a franchise than 
any four-unit course could 
possibly match. 

K EVIN MITcHEll. for Tom Gordon and Kevin Appier 
doesn't look so bad anymo~. 

• Of all teams, the Dodgers 
should know that pitching wins 
titles. Giving up Tim Belcher was 
a huge mistake. 

On the other hand, Eric Davis, 
Darryl Strawberry and Brett 
Butler ... sounds like the NL All-
Star team. 

• Ithe's not careful, Shaquille 
O'Neal could become the next 
victim of media hype. Being 
played up as the greatest thing 
since Wilt Chamberlain, and then 
getting outplayed by Elmore 
Spencer is not recommended for 
those interested in multi-million-
dollar contracts.

men's basketball 76-71 
in final of TIp-Off; 
UCSD shoots just 23 
percent in second half 
By Peter Ko 
Sports Editor 

It was definitely not a typical 
night for the UCSD men's basket-
ball team. 

How odd was it? Considerthat in 
the championship game of its own 
Triton Tip-Off Tournament. in its 
own gym, UCSD lost to PointLoma 
Nazarene 76-71. 

Perhaps taking their cue from 
recent weather patterns, consider 
that the Tritons shot a positively 
frigid 23 percent from the field in 
the second half. 

Consider that, while the Tritons 
were flinging up brick after brick, 
Point Lorna was ringing home shot 
after shot to the tune of 62 percenl 
from the floor in Ihe second half. 
'They shot the ball better than we've 
ever seen them shoot before," said 
UCSD Head Coach Tom Marshall. 

Consider that Rick Batt, a career 
60 percent shooter from the floor, 
went I for 5 from the field against 
the Crusaders. 

For that matter, considerthatBatt 
took just five shots. 

"I don't know in the four years 
that he's been here that he's ever 
been I for 5," Marshall said. Batt 
did manage I I points, with a 9 for

Point guard Monique Vaillancourt 
goes up fora shot against Pomona. 

By Peter Ko 
Sports Editor 

All Judy Malone could do was 
watch. 

The UCSD women's basketball 
head coach could do nothing but 
stand and watch from the sidelines, 
as forward Cari Young broke two 
school records that Malone herself 
had set 17 years ago, as the Tritons 
romped to a 78-69 victory over 
Pomona-Pitzer Tuesday night. 

Young set new school records 
for points in a single game with 40 
and field goals in a game with 19, 
breaking the former marks of 38 

and 17, respectively. Young also 
hauled down 19 rebounds. All in all, 
a fairly decent night's work. 

"As a formerplayer,l know that 
you don '( get into a groove like that 
very often, so it was fun to watch," 
Malone said. 

UCSD (2-1) needed every bit of 
Young's effort, because the 
Sagehens ' Caryn Cranston was go-
ing hog wild in her own right. 
Cranston had 23 points in the first 
half, and finished with 31 points and 
18 rebounds. 

Nevertheless, Malone said, "I

Nope, No Heroes Here 
M AIt'I1NA NA VRAnI.OVA SAYS tbatif SM hildbeendiagnosed as being HIV-positive, rather than Magic Johnson, she'd have been IOld that she deserved her dealh sentence. 
Meanwhile. Magic Johnson has become the hero of millions-after 
making it perfectly clear that he got the disease through unsafe 
heterosexual sex. 

Sorry to infonn those of you who'd side with Arsenio Hall and the 
rest of those paning Johnson on the back, but I'm going with 

Navratilovaon this one. Mag-

ic is DOl my hero. 
This isn't 10 say thaUdon 't 

feel for him. Johnson is un-
doubledly one of the finest 
haskethaIl piayersever, seems 
10 be an incredibly warm. in-
telligent, and nice human be-

ing, and doesn't deserve the hideous, drawn-out death that awaits 
him in the c1oser-than-we'd-like-to-thinIt future. I was stunned and 
hun when I discovered that he had tested mv -positive. 

But this entire Magic/HIV'story has also filled me with a great 
deal of anger. First off,let'saddressNaVl'llilova's points: sexism and 
hderosexism. The fact is, ifwefoundouctbatawoman had slept with 
as many uncounted partners as Johnson (who admitted he couldn't 
pidc out who he got the disease from ... no doubt due to the sheer 
nmnber of women he had sex with), we'd say that she was a slut or 
a ttamp or a whore Johnson, however, has simply been a "stud." 

Andifit was Navratilova, a lesbian? Simple: she's been perfonn-
ing unnatural acts. She's got it coming, just like all of those 
homosexuals did 

The fact that Johnson bas mv is a positive step for increasing 
AIDS awareness. But it also sbows just how palhetic our society's 
attitudes IOward sex really are. For Johnson to be ac:cepted as a hero, 
he first bad to make it clear on the Arsenio Hall Show that he wasn't 
one of those homosexuals. When that was over, it was okay 10 touch 
him, to malce him a hero. 

The facts are tbaI it's been at least eight years since we discovered 
how the AIDS-causing virus is transmittal Johnson kept having 
unprotected sex. With multiple partners. Had he listened, the whole 
thing could have been prevented. 

Still, he doesn't deserve what has happened to him. But neither 
did the thousands of victims who died of AIDS before anyone knew 
what caused it Our society didn't care about them. They got what 
was coming 10 them, simply because of their lifestyle. But Magic 
Johnson - he's a hero. 

Unlike many other AIDS victims past, present and future, Magic 
knew what causes the disease and should have taken steps to prevent 
it. In some ways, he is less deserving of our pity than those forgotten 
thousands who died in the late '70s and early '80s. 

But Magic is okay-he's a heterosexual, a man, an athlete. We 
approve of all the attributes that go along with those roles. 

The fBCl that AIDS awareness is increasing DOW is wonderful. But 
the reason it's increasing is because Magic - someone who coUIIIs 
- has got tI)e disease.Jt's a scathing indictment of our society, that 
we had to wait until Magic Johnson was mY-positive before we'd 
care about a spreading epidemic that's probably 100 percent fatal. 

For those of you looking for sports in this column, for a diversion 
from the terrible realities of everyday life, I'm afraid you haven't 
found any. 

This column IS about reality. And-especially in times likethese 
- reality is far more important than any fantasy world we might like 
10 build around ourselves.

ContInued from PICe 9 
rest after playing a frantic first half, 
thai ended with UCSD leading 41-
39. 

The Tritons are trying to playa 
more up-tempo offense this year, 
but theSagehens matched them step 
for step, up and down the court. 

Furthermore, Pomona-Pitzer 
countered the Tritons' pressure de-
fense with one of its own. The 
Sagebens harassed UCSD with a 
full-cow1 press and then collapsed 
into a zone. 

Malone noted that all of the Tri-
tons' opponents this year have tried 
to press, in pan because staning 
point guard Kathleen Alvarez is out 
with an ankle injury. 

SPORTS 11 

"We've got an off-guard han-
dling the point and a freshman com-
ing in ... I think I'd press too," 
Malone said, laughing. 

UCSD has been forced to start 
Monique Vaillancourt at the point, 
although Vaillancourt is normally a

injury leaves freshman Sara Mease 
as the main baclc.up.

Still, Malone has been impressed 
with the play of Mease: "We've put 
her in some pressure situations, and 
she's handled them well," Malone 
said. 

Ovenill, however, Malone said 
that she would like to see more 
consistency handling the press: "We 
need to work on our press offense. 
We handled it well at times, and at 
others, it wasn't so good." 

Malone would also like to get

offense. Beaver has struggled this

"She's not as mobile as Cari, so

UCSD, TV ain't on the air ... yet 
BY MARISA LEE . SPECTACLE WRITER 

A s early as Fall 1992. UCSD students may happen to kick back in front of the TV and accidenlaUy stumble upon the university's firsa-ever campus television 
station. Broadcast into Ihousands of homes in neighborins 
communities, the sbIIion would not mimic PBS, but would open 
university programs, bod! cultural and educational, to the 
community. 

Mary WaishoIt, dean of University Extension as well as chair 
of the advisory committee that is to oversee the implementation 
of the station, is optimistic that it will serve the conununity with 
the variety of resources offered by UCSD, such as cultural 
events and multilingual edlIcaIional programs. 

"Some of the programs will serve as a continuing education 
for professors, teachers, lawyers, doctors, nurses and engineers," 
she says: 

"Although it will be directed toward !be public as a commu-
nity service, it will also serve as a magnet for independenl 
producers and will be available to medical students, faculty 
members, graduate sludents and Scripps researchers for films, 
production work and special projects. 

"Ideally. though, we are hoping to raise the awareness of the 
surrounding conunuJ?ity of UCSD's unique educational opportu-
oltie and programs." Broadcast would include new fi nding in 
research, topicallec(lI res and feature of them any "talented 
mu ician and petfonning arts students" of UCSD.

The notion d a campus lelevisioo saation is not a new one. 
The idea originlled about five yean ago in the minds of many 
who worbd in the Media Center and Cmununication depart-
ment. Since then, the plan bas passed through a number of : 
bureaucratic regulations, such as building licenses and permits, 
federal approvals, IIIIOrney processes, fees and overall approval ' . 
by the FCC and UC Regents. . . 

Dr. Harold TlCho, vi~llor of Academic Affairs and a . 
physics professor, has been the ''main driving force behind this -
whole idea." Says Walshok, "He's the one who has kept the bBtl 
rolling with the FCC, attorneys and the budget. He is responsibf'e., 
for making this a reality." 

According to Walshok, the Slation will not be a big stUdio 
production with highly technical equipment. It will be runWa . 
limited staff comprised of a manager, technician and a conUnu: 
tee of three faculty members, three membefS from the ,. 
oily, one graduate student and one unde~. ., .~ ." ~ •. 

In addition"to the Media Center and the Convn~~t. ~;

Getting the Shaft 

Kensington Video is for the intelligent home viewer, not your average vidiot 
BY JOHN SWEENEY . CONTRIBUTING WRITER 

I awake with Isaac Hayes' theme song to the movie Shoft ruming through my head. This continues all day and by evening I am 
ready to stop by the local video store and pick 
up a heavy dose of the exploits of the private 
eye. But what's this? The video store attendant 
apologizes, there is no film titled Shaft in their 
catalog. An outrage! My mood turns ugly. I feel 
a righteous anger, noc unlike that of Vincent 
Price in TM AbomifllJble Dr. Phibes. I ask the 
attendant to bring me this fllm. They have 
never heard of this one either. I now realize that 
I should have gone to the Ken video store in the 
fust place. 

the financial gamble. There are many films that 
we do not get our investment back on, but we 
see that as an investment in ourselves. We do 
not want to be a clone of anodler video store, 
we want to be unique in our own right. We look: 
at ourselves more as a film archive rather than 
just another place that's going to have the top 

~~ 
~ ~ 

If Ghost, LooIc Who's Talking and Pretty 
Woman have ceased to spark your interest and 
you' re looking for new territory in the realm of 
film and video, then Kensington Video should 
be next on your agenda. Upon entering the 
store, one is immediately struck by the fact that 
simply browsing here will take a considerable 
amount of time. 1be store is decorated with 
scores of movie posters and promotional movie 
paraphernalia from years past dangling from 
the ceiling. perched above bounleOUS racks of 
videos. The film connoisseur has found home. 

Ken Video, located next door to the Ken 
Theater in Kensington, has seven major 
categories of videos: the mammodl classic film 
section, including an extensive silent film 
collection, general interest and standard issue 
films, a very large foreign film section, a 
section devoted to television series, concerts 
and docwnentaries, another devoted to the fine 
arts, including operas, ballets and animation, an 
wui valed honor and science fiction section and 
a growing section of fibns from the BBC, the 
largest fibn library in the world Sorry voyeurs, 
there 's no "adult" section, but Ken Video does 
boast a hearty variety of orgasmic art films. 

Kensington Video, which had its inception 
in the comer of a greeting card store in 1984, is 
owned and operated by Guy Hanford, his sister 
Pam Sisneros, his parents Richard and Wirmie 
Hanford, "along with lcids from the neighbor· 
hood who help out in the store." 

"Our customers are from entire strata of 
society," says Guy Hanford. who is also an 
elementary school teacher in Ramona. "They 
all merge at this place. We have a microcosm 
of San Diego here. We'U have the little old lady 
renting Gone With the Wind right next to the 
guy renting The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. 
They' ll never party together, but they'll rent 
together. Everybody has their own thing that 
they fall in love with, which also makes it han1 
on us. 

''We get a lot of films and videos that the 
typical video store wouldn 't have because of 

five hundred movies." 
Ken Video has 9,500 videos in its collection, 

and that's counting actual titles, not simply 
multiple tape copies. Among some of their 
rarely seen films are Roger Ebert's Beyond Ihe 
Valley if the Dolls, Shock T rwtment (the 
sequel 10 TM Rocky Horror Picture Show) and 
the original Cape Fear. 

"So enonnous and vast is their collection, it 
makes the mouth waler," says Warren College 
junior and cinema enthusiast John Aorendo. 
"It's a walk down memory lane as well as film 
history. Heck, it 's gOi all those 'Sinbad' movies 
I saw when I was a kid - need I say more?" 

Presently Ken Video has no plans to branch 
out. 

"We're really happy we can work together 
here in a family atmosphere," Hanford says. "If 
we branched out our family 
would be segmented, and 
we don't want to do that. 
This way we can put all 
of our energies into one 
place."

HardCore Films 
keep it rolling 

BY JENNIFER ABRAHAMSON , 
CONTRIBUTING WRITER 

fI hush sweeps over a crowd of whisper-ing lips as lights flood over newly lit, anticipating faces. The grand perfonn-ers take their positions, the various 
ftlm crews intently set their gaze upon them, 
and the cameras are ready 10 roll once again. 
Studio 140 is ready for action. A forceful click 
of the clapper reverbcn1es around the room as 
the show begins. The monwnental production 
in progress is one of the filst HardCore FtIm 
Productions meetings of the year. UCSD' s one 
and only film-making club is back for the 
commencement of its fourth go-around. 

Since its appearance in the 1988-89 
academic year, HarrlCore has bloomed into 
one of the most productive organizations on 
campus. 

"It's larger than it's ever been." says Peter 
Rollins, director of HardCore' s most recent 
film, Sara. "Usually 100 show at the first 
meeting, 50 at the second, and so on. This year 
it's different. This is the most stable it's ever 
been." 

In 1988, Rico Martinez, a graduate film 
student, along with undergraduates Mike 
Alberts and Milton fletcher, wanted to make a 
decent film. They formed HardCore and 
produced Bugs in Our Hair, a look at a group 
of cavemen discussing the progress and 
stagnancy of evolution. Bugs in Our Hair was 
made with just $500, obtained through grants 
and fundraising. 

The following year, N uc/ear Wosred was 
produced. The focus of the film is a group of 
teenage surfers who have a toxic encounter 
with the looming San Onofre nuclear power 
plant on the shore near Camp Pendlecon. 

Sara, now in post-production, is a more 
serious, moving depiction of the relationship 
between a tormented young Salvadoran 
refugee and an older Jewish woman. 

Imagine what goes into making a major 
Hollywood film. People are in charge of 
special effects, distribution and funding, 
sound production, light production, set design; 
writing, editing, casting and camera operating 
are just a handful of the functions a produc-
tion team must pertonn. TI!en there are the 
actors. Most moviegoers just look for the 
names of big stars, ignoring the anonymous 
credits rolling by as they race out of the 
theater. For HardCore, those martyrs are the 
stars. 

"The process of making [a ftlm] is more 
important than the fmal project," says Josh 
leBeau, director of Nuclear W osred and 
currently an assistant editor for Columbia 
Pictures in Los Angeles. "Learning how to 
work with people is the most valuable aspect 
of filmmaking which has helped me in the 
real world." 

"[At HardCore,] a freshman, a biochemis-
try major, can come in and actually be the first 
assistant camera," says distribution coordina-
tor loel High. "A lot of people who aren't VA 
majors who want to learn about camera work 
or learn anything at all about making films

Blood/all, HardCore's first color film, was 
released last spring. In it, torrents of a blood-
red mau rain from the skies, blanketing the 
earth in this black satire questioning 
humankind's purpose and place in the world. 

"HardCore offers us the chance to be 
completely responsible for ourselves," adds 
publicity coordinator Michele Kasik. "So far, 
we've had our parents to fall back on - but

keeping the club going and making a film, is

• "What you get out of it is what you put 

into it," says leBeau. ''There is no ruling 
hierarchy in HardCoce - if you give the 
effort, you will reap the rewards. 

High is derennined to enter HardCore 
films in various film festiWlls and competi-
tioos. His main goal is acknowledgement 
outside the UCSD community, with his 
ultimate target being Hollywood. 

"We've been heard about in Minnesol8," 
says Kasik. "[A) university called us and is 
adamant about creating anoIher branch of 
HardCore out there." 

HardCore is a highly social organization. It 
welcomes any experienced or noo.cxperi-
enced people who want to learn the intricacies 
of the real film-making world. 

Refreshments, laughter and business all 
flow at weekly meetings and film shoots. 
Shoots often involve travel. Member Lesley 
Langs recalls HardCore' s first location shoot 
for Bugs in Our Hair. "The whole crew spent 
three days camped out under the stars in a vast 
mountainous wasteland - three separate 
times." 

The next location shoot will be for 
Woodland Dream, HardCore's flfSt fantasy 
film and Langs' first shot at directing. Jenna 
McConnel will be head editor of the produc-
tion and Heidi Meyer will be first assistant 
director. 

"Lesley is by far the most qualified person 
for the job, it's as simple as that," says Sean 
Thomas, director of photography. 

Rollins, director of Bloo;:fa/I, jokes, "She's 
really the flJ'St director who actually has 
enough experience to hold the position." 

Unfortunately, funding a major HardCore 
production can be quite expensive for student 
ftlmmakers. Langs predicts the production 
will cost at least $6,000. HardCore members 
have become professionals at raising money 
through fundraisers such as car washes, can 
drives and the showing of films such as This-
is Spinal Tap . The group also offers the 
"HardCore Classic Film Series" every 
Monday at 7:00 p.m. in SLH 107. So far the 
series has included Black Narcissus and the 
original print of Night of the Living Dead. 

The key to a film's success is publicity. 
"So far, San Diego has been unresponsive to 
HardCore," Kasik says. "People have been 
supportive, but not in the way of giving 
money or even film, which is extremely 
expensive." 

HardCore's ultimate goal is to be working 
on three films per year, in pre-production, 
production and post-production. The only 
way to achieve this is to set up a system of 
regular fund-raising. 

'There simply isn't a market out there for 
one-man-created films," says Howard. "L, the 
movie industry there's only a market for 
group production filmmaIting. HardCore is 
the only place here where one can get that 
very experience." 

"It has become an obsession," High says. 
"I suppose that's why we're called 
HardCore."
