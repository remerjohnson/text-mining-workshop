$39,000 in Fees Stolen 
Unguarded SDSU Registration Fees Taken 
By John Klock 

On Jan. 19, four cashiers at 
San Diego State Unjversity 
registration bundled up the 
cash and checks they had been 
collecting all day from students 
paying fees, carried the bulky 
envelopes into the accounting 
room and dumped them in a box 
with everyone else's receipts. 

But before the envelopes 
could be opened and the money 
processed, someone reached in 
the box and pulled them out, 
stuffed them in a bulky coat and 
got away with $39,000. 

That Is the best guess of John 
Carpenter, SDSU police chief, 
as to bow that much money 
could have disappeared from 
the day's total. 

"I have been interviewing 
people to familiarize myself 
with the procedure. I knew 
right a way where the 
problems were. With 35 or 40 
people coming in and outofthat 
room, it would have been easy 
for one of them to pick up' a 
couple of envelopes without 
being caught," Carpenter said. 

"You can't operate on the 
assumption that everyone's 
trustworthy. I guess it has 
worked in the past, Qut their 
time has come," he said, 
promising that registration 
procedures in the future would 
be changed to provide close 
accountability. 

Procedures at UCSD's 
central cashier's office should 

prevent such a theft from 
happening here, according to 
Raymond Frey, manager of the 
office. 

"We have individua 
accountability here. Each 
cashier has to reconcile his 
account each day," Frey said. 

The only cash in a similar, 
vulnerable situation is a small 
amount that comes in the drop-
in, he said. 

"The drop-in goes right into a 
safe, though," Frey said. 

He also said other offices on 
campus that he's familiar with, 
including the housing office, 
also have individual account-
ability. .

Vending Fund 
Transfer Excites 
"Angry Reaction 

By Bob Slaymaker 
In support of a rare public 

. show of student and adminis-
trative anger, the AS Council 
voted unanimously last week to 
express its "outrage" at 
Chancellor William McElroy's 
decision last summer to take 
vending machine revenues 
away from student activities in 
order to help cover a Food and 
Housing Services deficit. 

In addition to throwing 
support behind the four college 
government's statement of 
outrage, the resolution called 
for AS President John Jenkel 
and representatives from the 
four colleges to meet with Vice 
Chancellor of Financial 
Management Herm Johnson 
and McElroy over the loss of 
funding. Tb.e resolution also 
calls for the student repre-
sentatives to report back to the 
Council within two weeks so the 
Council can initiate a strategy 

to regain the lost funds . 
McElroy's plan, which will 

take effect July 1, would 
incorporate the profi t s 
recei ved from vending 
machines into FHS revenues. 
Presently, a good portion of the 
money obtained from on-
campus vending machines is 
used to fund a variety of student 
programs, including the four 
college governments, Third's 
Cultural Awareness Day, the 
Warren Outback Cafe and the 
L.A. Times subscription in 
Cluster Lil>rary. 

Lack of Student Input 
Most of the student and 

administrative anger arose 
over the fact that the decision 
was made without student 
input. Zephyr Goldsmith, a 
member of the Third College 
Council, summed up the feeling 
of most of the students at the 
Council meeting when he said,

Coors Forum is on

Representatives froni both 
the Coors Brewing Company 
and the Boycott Coors 
Committee, which has charged 
Coors with unfair labor 
practices, will be on campus 
today to answer questions in a 
forum from one to four o'clock 
in the Student Center North 
Conference Boom. 

The forum, being sponsored 
by the campus radio station 
KSDT, is intended to clear the 

air about the allegations 
against Coors. Brad Thorn-
burg, KSDT general manager, 
said Coors submitted a serie of 
1940s radio programs to the 
station and that the station will 
not run the programs if the 
charges against Coors are true. 

The forum will be broken into 
three 45-minute sessions with 
breaks in between to " allow 
new students to come in, and 
others to leave," said Gina

UEO" Loses Money on Chapin, Others 
By Kathy Huffer 
Senior Staff Writer 

A low audience turnout and 
publicity difficulties combined 
to set back a recent University 
Events concert by at least 
$478. 

Last week Tom Chapin 
performed at UCSD and 
attracted only about 300 people, 
according to Ruth Baily, 
publicity coordinator for 
University Events . 

Diane Annala, Director of 
University Events, called the 
concert a "fluke." She said that 
the low turnout "was unu ual " 
termed it " a blow " to 
Univer ity Event . 

Baily said that niver ity 
Event " lost more (money)

that th y had hoped for b twe n 
1000-1300 people at the concert. 

S v ral factor wer Ited by 
niversity E vents per onn I as 

contributing to th mall 
hapin audienc and to a 

general difficulty in attractina 
large audiences to their events. 

"We were really handi-
capped by his agency," Baily 
said of the Chapin concert. 

Chapin's agency , she 
explained, was to send 
University Events a "huge 
amount" of promotional 
material, but did not. Baily aid 
that University Event never 
received the album and t-
hirt th y had expected from 

Chapin's agency . The agency 
did send them about 1000

AS ShQuld Take Over Machines 
. Vending Transfer 
Hurts College 
Governments 

Editor: 

The Guerdl8fl Mon., F .b. 5, 1979 

Chancellor McEI roy has 
recently made a fund.ing 
decision which, if enacted, will 
drastically infringe on student 
government independence and 
control. The administration has 
moved to cut off monies to the 
college student governments 
received from vending 
machine profits. This money 
which has been used to run 
graduation ceremonies, 
orientation sessions, and other 
college activities shall soon be 
used to subsidize Food Service 
operations that are presently 
losing money . I wish to raise 
serious questions to this action 
both on a moral and legal basis. 

Food Facilities which are used 
mostly by staff. faculty and 
graduates (Coffee Hut, Winzer 
Commons and Scripps) and 
which were designed to be self-
sufficient: thirdly, vending 
maclrine money which has 
unrestricted control by college 
governments will be replaced 
by Reg Fee money which shall 
be given to college adminis-
trators on a yearly application 
basis. 

My last objection to the 
Chancellor's vending machine 
plan is that students should not 
be forced to subsidize poorly 
operated food service facilities . 
In the "real" world when a 
restaurant cannot pay for 
itself. it is closed. This should 
be the same criterion for 
facilities on campus. 

Human Life ·Committee 
Commends Armitage Offer 

In the past, vending machine 
profits have been split between 
college governments and the 
Graduate Student Council . For 
appromimately ten years these 
funds have been used to offer 
programs as described above. 
But this year, with the need for 
an "ausLere"budget and 
impending budget cuts, the 
administration has red flagged 
money which they feel easiest 
to re-route, that is the students' 
activities money . I find this 
action logically inconsistent 
inasmuch ·as the Chancellor 
recently conducted a ten-year 
review of Muir College and' 
found that students want more 
activities and better com-
munication about such 
activities. This is done by 
increasing resources to college 
governments - certa inly not 
be decreasing the amount. 

The ASUCSD has voted to 
.repre ent the entire student 
body on this issue . As the 
student advocate group, the 
ASUCSD shall present a united 
voice to the administration. 
The AS should s tudy the 
possibility of running their own 
vending machine operation . 
ASUe Berkeley and ASUe Los 
Angeles have bot~ operated 
their own vending operation for 
years with much success. 

The action taken by the 
University administration 
must be questioned and 
Irescinded.

Iran Cancels $7 Billion 
In· US Military Equipment 

Egypt Won't Talk 
With Israel Now 

CAIRO, Egypt (AP) - Egypt 
- has rejected an Israeli proposal 

for a summit meeting at the 
Sinai town of AI Arish to resolve 
differences over a Mideast 
peace settlement, a weekly 
magaiine said yesterday. 

The Cairo magazine Rose E I 
Youssef reported that U.S. 
roving Ambassador Alfred 
Atherton relayed the proposal 
to Egyptian President Anwar 
Sadat after he discussed it with 
Israeli Prime Minister 
Menacl)em Begin last month. 

According to the magazine, 
the Israelis recommended that 
the two leaders meet in Al Arish 
and called for President 
Carter's participation at a later 
stage. It said without 
elaboration that Washington 
was not enthusiastic about the 
idea . 

The magazine quoted 
unidentified American sources 
as saying Washington is 
currently stUdying a proposal 

for holding a foreign ministers 
meeting but did not say if 
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance 
would participate. 

Cairo's semi-ofCicial AI 
Ahram newspaper reported 
that Carter is studying 
Atherton's report and plans to 
contact Sadat after Chinese 
Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-ping 
ends his visit to the United 
States today. 

In Tel Aviv. Israel radio 
reported that the Supreme 
Court yesterday ordered a 
commission to study land 
claims at a site on the occupied 
West Bank of the Jordan River 
where Palestinians are trying 
to block construction of a new 
Jewish settlement. 

The court prohibited any 
development at Nebi Salah, 
miles north of JerusaJem, until 
the commission ruled on 
ownership of the disputed 5-
acre site.

BADEN-BA DEN, West 
Germany (AP) - Lord

mittee. said yesterday that the 
deadline will not be extended 
beyond March 1 for Los Angeles 
to sign the Olympic Games

Peoples Republic of China will 
partiCipate in Moscow. 

WASHINGTON (AP) - Iran 
has decided to cancel U.S. arms 
purchases worth billions of 
dollars and has asked the 
United Slates to reduce sharply 
its military advisory presence 
in the country, informed 
sources said yesterday . 

"The total figure of the 
reduction may rea ch $7 
billion," a source said. 

Under the Shah of Iran, the 
Tehran government bought or 
agreed to buy about $20 billion 
in U.S. military equipment. 
training or construction. About 
$8 billion worth already has 
been delivered : 

A reduction of about $7 billion 
would wipe out much of the 
projected sales targeted for 
delivery over the next several 
years. 

The cutbacks requested by 
the embattled civilian 
government left in charge after 
the shah's departure Jan. 16 
reflect a changed political 
climate as well as questions 
about Iran's future military 
posture in the strategic Persian 
Gulf area. 

The reductions are "to start 
immediately." a source said, 
adding they were worked out by 
Iranian officials and special 
Pentagon envoy Erich von 
Marbod in talks that ended 

Saturday. Gen. Robert Huyser, 
deputy chief of U.S. forces in 
Europe. also took part, sources 
said. 

According to the- sources, 
agreed-on U.S . reductions in 
foreign military sales to Iran 
include 160 F-16 fighter planes; 
seven radar-equipped Airborne 
Warning and Control System 
aircraft; two Spruance class 
destroyers ; 16 RF-4E recon-
naissance planes ; a variety of 
missiles; and armored and 
other vehicles. 

The sources said Iran asked 
that the American Military 
Advisory Group' 'be reduced to 
250 people and also requested a 
major cutback in contract 
follow-on support." 

Follow-on support refer.s to 
largely civilian personnel sent 
to Iran to help the Iranians 
train with purchased U.S. 

coming ... 

equipment. 
Pre-reduction strength of the 

U.S . military advisers in Iran 
was believed to number about 
960. At its peak, the overall U.S. 
presence in Iran has been 
placed as high as 45,000 people" 
including dependents . As of 
Jan . 25, the Pentagon has said, 
there were 888 U.S. military 
and Defense Department 
employees and 85 dependents in 
Iran . 

Iran's economy. hurt by a 
loss of oil money, has taken a 
beating as the shah and the 
shah-appointed government of 
Prime Minister Shahpour 
Bakhtiar struggled to maintain 
power under attack by 
followers of reli~ious leader 
Ayatollah RuhoHah Khomeini. 
He wants to establish a 
neutralist Islamic Republic. 

Should this happen, Killanin 
said, the organizing committee 
shall immediately contact 
those cities which hosted the 
Games in the past. It is then up 
to the German national 
committee to decide if the next 
games should be held in 
Munich .

Cager~ Lose 75-74, 
.Drop to 1-4 in ·League 

By Kevin Elliott 
Starr Wriler 

The UCSD varsity basketball 
team lost another close contest 
Saturday night, getting nipped 
by the Azusa Pacific Cougars, 
75-74. 

Although the Tritons lost, 
they did something different 
than last Saturday, playing 
their sloppy ball during the first 
half, not the second half, saving 
their best for last. Instead of 
(ailing apart in the closing 
minutes as they have in the past 
four games, the team rallied 
together and pulled even before 
losing by just one point. The 
loss brought the Tritons' league 

record to 1-4. 
Both squads came out 

running in the fi rst half trading 
quick baskets in the early 
minutes. Led by Scott Knudsen 
and Bob Frazier UCSD stayed 
right with the Cougars for the 
first ten minutes of the game. 

The Tritons lost their poise 
and began to fall behind 
midway through the first half. 
The Cougars, led by Larry 
Shelton, began to pull away and 
led by 13 points, the biggest 
margin of the evening with five 
minutes to go. In the final 
moments before the break the 
Tritons regained composure 
closing the gap to 45-38 at 
halftime. 

and with two minutes to go, the 
Cougars' Rick Dillon hit four 
free throws to pull his team 
ahead, 74-70 . 

With one minute left Omalev 
hit two important free throws to 
bring UCSD within 2 points, 74-
72 . With 15 seconds left 
Frazier's desperation shot 
from 20 feet lipped the rim and 
it was all over. 

After the game Coach 
Cunningham, who last week 
announced his resignation 
effective at the end of the 
season, expressed his pride 
with the team's comeback . 
"Our guys played a good 
second half. We came back 
strong and finally executed our 
offense, Our guard play was 
excellent tonight and we played 
a fantastic second half ." I

Hills too 
Tough to 
Conquer 

The momentum continued to 
shift towards UCSD in the 
beginning o( the second half as 
the Tritons made up the deficit. 
With just nine minutes to play 
Lehman Brockett stole the ball 
and brought UCSD to within a 
point on a crowd-pleasing stuff. 

Assistant Coach Mallory 
Mitchell added, "We played a 
good game, but our freethrows 
hurt us again ."

An extremely quick women's 
basketball team (rom CSU 
Dominguez Hills came to the 
Maif.1 Gym last Friday evening 
and ran away with an easy 77-29 
victory over the Tritons. 

" Dominguez Hills was 
a lightning-fast team with 
incredible athletes," praised 
UCSD coach Judy Malone. 

Five members of the DH 
team scored in double figures . 

Despi te the loss , which 
Malone honestly termed " a 
c ream ," the coach was 
" pleased' with her team's 
improvement. Since the loss of 
star playe r Ca rol Hawley, who 
has left the team due to 
" persona l reasons," the team 
has been faced with the task of 
r es tructur ing offenses a nd 
defenses with a revised line-up. 

" We've had to go back to the 
ba s ic s of how to play 
basketball," remarked 
Malone. " At first the girls were 
sort of let down after Carol left , 
but they bounced back and

Charged up by his dunk, 
Brockett went to work on the

the Tritons even at 66-66 with 
only five minutes to play. Both 
teams traded clutch baskets

Amid Confusion,Swimmers Win 
By Jon Goelz 

Senior Staff Writer 
Both the men's and women's 

swim teams beat UC Riverside 
Friday night, though they 
probably would have settled for 
a seat in front of a blazing 
fireplace or a warm shower 
instead. 

The meet was not the 
primary concern of all the 
swimmers that night. "The 
extraneous variables were 
enough to distur:b any 
swimmer," said women's 
coach Diana Dann after the 
competition. 

"Number one, It was really 
cold," she recalled. "Number 
two, it was raining and the pool 
area wasn't sheltered. 

"Number three, the starter 
was inexperienced. He was 
inconsistent on some starts and 
he took his time out there while 
everyone was freezing," said 
Dann. 

Adding to the growing 
confusion, the Riverside pool's 
poor lightillg hampered vision 

as the meet ran into the 
darkness. The facility lacked 
backstroke nags. Events were 
called that the UCSD coaches 
weren't informed of before the 
meet. 

Men's coach · Bill Morgan 
shared Dann's bewilderment 
and disgust with the meet. "The 
meet was poorly run," he said. 
"We won't be going back there 
again." 

As a result, both teams were 
happy to jus! get their wins and 
leave as soon as possible. The 
men saved time by cancelling 
the 1000 free event, and still won 
71-29. 

No records were broken, no 
new All Americans qualified 
Friday. Swimming their off 
events, in off conditions, 
Riverside is one of the few 
schools the Tritons could have 
beaten with their line-up that 
day. 

The highlights of the 
competition included Nelson 
J1oward's double win in the 100 
and 200 free, J~ Hernandez' 

firsts in the 50 and 500 and Brian 
Smith's second place rinish in 
the breaststroke: 

The women likewise failed to 
score impressive times, but 
came home with a 65-49 victory 
anyway. 

The meet afforded new-
comers Nancy Lew and Kathy 
Conklin third place finishes and 
a second in the 50 free for Susie 
Zneimer. 

Shawn Blaisdell and Janet 
Parkinson both swam to double 
victories. Chris Evans added ' 

another first in the 50 back and 
almost won another when she 
placed second in the 100 
individual medley. 

The girls are baCk iii the pool 
Wednesday for a meet against 
visiting Utah. 
. With the home pool advan-

tage, however. she exppcts .a 
closer competition. Dann alse 
sends out a plea for timers to 
work during the 3 pm meet. 

Then on Friday, the women 
as well as the men fate Whittier

Netters Defeated

Spor&I Edi&or 
The men's' tennis team 

almost walked away with an 
upset over San Diego State last 
week, narrowly losing 31h to 
51h. 

"The match really could 
have gone either way," said 
Triton coach Tad Yamaguchi. 
"There were lots of close, three 
game sets, including a tie 
breaker in first singles." . 

hard to lose, especially in a set 
like that," remarked Metsch's 
teammate Ron Phillips. 

Phillips had his share of 
trouble, too, dropping the 
number five singles match to 
Pete Davis, 6-3, 6~.

Stalking the UCSD Literary Magazine 
By Lyaeue Tom 

S&8ff Wriler 
.. Av ant-ga rde ," "Self-

critical, " "Experimental, " 
"Diverse" and " Monographic" 
are some of the adjectives used 
to describe the writings found 
in each of UCSD's five literary 
magazines. 

Of the quintet, Crawl o.t 
Your WlJIdow is perhaps the 
most innovative in tenns of its 
writing techniques. Notebook 
el'cerpts from a Guatemala 
trip, an account of a San Diego 
tour in a script format, a 
journal r.eproduced in the 

authoress's actual handwriting 
and transcriptions of tape 
recorded short stories are 
examples encountered within 
the publication's pages since its. 
establishment in 1975. 

" It's based on experimental 
narrative writing which is 
more original than usual." said 
current director of the Warren 
Writing Program and co-editor 
Paul Dresman. 

The spring quarter of 1979 is 
the scheduled debut of Crawl 
Oat Your Window's next effort, 
a special double issue, which 
wiU be funded by a National

intricate Ullivenal Jewels: 
Localor' to Tracy Witt'.-stnlung 
geometrics, ' seen in tbe 
magazine's last issue, wbicb 
was published in spring 1978_ 

In its early beginnings, 
He1keD was known primarily 
as a small, poetry-oriented 
journal. The publication bas 
since grown in both size and 
scope as Roadwork, a 
magazine designed, in the 
words of co-editor Robert 
McDonell, "for all working 
writers; students and faculty 
are able to see their writing in 
print together." 

While tbe three-year-old 
publication still baa a poetry 
component, its contributions 
have expanded to include 
interviews and prose. Raad-
work'. last issue, published in 
Srpirul Jm. exemplifies sucb 
diversity, from the stark 
EngliBb translations of 
Vietnamese poetry, to the 
revealing portraits of Visual 
Arts Professor David Antin and 

Honorary Philosophy Pro-
fessor Herbert Marcuse, to the 
straightforward diary entries 
of Fannie Wooden's Same Old 
Story: Journal , to Reinhard 
Lettau's witty dialogues set in 
an exiled Latin American 
dictators' convention. 

Like Crawl Out Your 
Window, Roadwork a Iso 
considers artwork, as editorial 
board member Clare Starrs 
puts it, "of particular interest." 

In addition to the pub-
lication's upcoming issue in 
early May will be the February 
appearance of Marklnp, a 
monthly magazine with a 
lengtb of sixteen pages. 
Described by Mc~nell as 
"distinctly concentrating on 
one writer and one artist,' UIe 
first issue will feature 
the works of Associate 
Professor of Literature Sherley 
~nne WilUams. 
. Roadwork places no p~ge 

limits f9r Its contributions. Tb~ 
deadline is April 1. Markinls, 
on the other hand, welcomes

Arts 
Record Reviews: Cleaning House 

By Ted Navin Burke 
Arts Editor 

As they tend to do on The 
Guardian arts desk, records 
have been piling up like poker 
chips , unreviewed and 
unopened. What follows is a bit 
of house cleaning - this desk at 
times looks like a place where 
they empty wastepaper 
baskets - and hopefully the 
dispensing of some information 
that might aid you next time 
you enter the loca I record store. 

Tokyo Tapes - Scorpions 
(RCA) 

Recorded live in Japan (the 
new hard-rock capital of the 
world) , the German Scorpions 
play their way through four 
sides of machine-shop heavy 
metal. The songs are generally 
undistinguished (this band 
exhibits little originality in the 
songwriting department) , the 
drum work tends to be as rigid 
as rigor mortis, and the 
singing, in phonetic English, 
approximates the sound of a 
barking dog_ What makes the 
album a delight, though, is the 
guitar work of Ulrich Roth. 
Like Edward Van Halen, 
Roth 's style combines flash 
(ala Jeff Beck and Johnny 
Wi nter), technique (Allan 
Ho ld s worth and Harvey 
Mandel), power (Leslie West 
a nd Hendrix) and taste 
(Ritchie Blackmore) . His solos 
are swooping, over-powering 
sorties, with dizzying sonic 
r iffs, fleet -fingered note-
cl us ters a nd screaming 
ostinato textures _ Despite the 
already listed complaints , 
Roth's performance makes the 
album worth owning. B. 

Shiny Beast (Bat Chain Puller) 
- Captain Beefheart and the 
Mag i c Ba nd (Warner 
Brothers) 

This is one of the few times 
tha t a ll of Beefheart's freaky 
talents have been . ca ptured 
successfully on record, easily 
the fi rst time since 1968's Trout 
\1ask Replica. The music is as 
cranki shly idiosyncratic as it's 
ever been (jump-cut time 
signatures, a free mixing of 
"free-jazz" randomness and 
pop song structures, blues and 
neoclassical shades blending 
into thick atonal texture) and 
Beefheart's vocals, one of the 
raspiest voices anywhere, 
de liver his dadaesque, feee-
associative lyrics with the 
same kind of off-kilter verve. 
The eHect sounds like an 
Unlikely supersession between 
Howlin ' Wolf and Alfred Jarry 
(costumes designed by Max 
Ernst) . His new Magic Band, 
fea turing ex-Zappa sidemen as 
Bruce Fowler (trombone) and 
Art Tripp (drums) , handle the 
demands of the music with 
disciplined ease, executing 
Bee fheart ' s non -sequitur 

~rra ngements with a pro-
feSS ionalism that tends toward 
both perfection and liveliness, 
usually an unlikely symbiosis 
in art-rock groups . However 
cerebral Beefheart 's music 
ounds, though , it should be 

POinted out that Shiny Bea., is a 
fun album, full of good humor 
and strong ongs. This tlme out, 
The Captain is out to entertain 
as well as beguile. A Plus . 

L - Lob Creme and Kevin 
Godley (Polydor) 

fun of) , this eHort by former 
10cc members Creme and 
Godley is one of the more 
enjoyable art' rock projects 
released in the last year_ 
Musically , they aspire to Frank 
Zappa 's fractured musical 
parodies, and pull it off most of 
the time. 

Lyrica lIy, the a Ibum tells the 
story of youths growing up 
absurd, the themes going from 
teenage sexuality. peer group 
pressure, political confusion 
and a final resolution that one 
must cast aside all the things 
that has formed one ' s 
personality and t.!!mperament 

and make one's way through 
the moral, aesthetic, intel-
lectual and political universes 
unfette red_ Thematica lly, L 
resembles Portrait of the Artist 
As a Young Man. Not grea t art, 
but nice. B. 

K-Scope - Phil Ma nzera 
(Polydor) 

Though K-Scope lacks some 
of the rhythmic interest a nd 
angular improvisations that 
made his previous Diamond 
Head record one of the more 
interesting experimental rock 
releases of 1976, Roxy Music 
guitarist Phil Manzenera 's new 

IHII VIII( :. 

one is still intriguingly off the 
bea ten path . The music is a bit 
more human this time out, i.e. 
more easilty accessible to a 
wider a udience, and Manzera 
himself keeps a relatively low 
profile throughout , keeping his 
guita r chores to setting mood, 
rhythm duties a nd occasiona l 
fills. The saxophone work by 
ex-King Crimson member Mel 
Collins adds an agreeable ja zzy 
lilt to the instrumental tracks. 

Still , one is left w;:titing for 
Manzera's work with the new 
Roxy Music a lbum, reportedly 
coming anyday . B-

Black Noise - FM (Visa) 
Musically, FM are the usual 

contrivance one comes to 
ex pect from a group of 
middling-lo-com petent mu-
sicians seeking to make art in

"We are tal 'ng about student 
control of ,lt dent money." 

Gary Moser, a member of the 
Student Center Board', 
sugge.ted that the students 
themselves contract out 
vending machines. He cited 
other UC student governments 
that did so, saying "UCLA and 
UC Berkeley students own their 
own vending machines and use 
the money to finance student 
activities. " 

Vice Chancellor of Financial 
Mana ement Herm Johnson 

said last week that provisions 
had already been made in the 
administration to eover lost 
vending machine revenue for 
the colleges for the next two 
years, after which, he said, the 
colleges will have to find 
alternative sources of funding. 

Johnson, who confirmed that 
student input had not been 
sought in the decision, also said 
that the Reg Fee committee 
would have the option of 
funding college programs, thus 
allowing. he said, students to 
decide their own priori pes in

spending. 
Revelle Dean Ernie Mort 

questioned the viability of Reg 
Fee funding, saying he "would 
have liked to have retained the 
machine revenue because of 
the nexibility with which the 
students could use it and 
because of its consistency. The 
Reg Fee Committee needs to 
realize that we need a 
consistent source of funding to 
keep the college governments 
running." 

Mike Stroud, chairman of the 
Muir Colle2e Caucus. said that 

ha vlng .. no discretiona ry 
money (available for student 
activltie.) would mean budgets 
would have to be allocated a 
year before ... Thi. would take 
away any decision-making 
power the governments might!

In May of 1978, Larry 

Barrett. director of Housing 
and Food Services, was asked 
to report on the financial state 
of the seven on-campus eating 
establishments. All but one of 
the establishments hid been

accumulating deficits and the 
total deficit was over $200,000. 
The report was aimed at 
exploring possibilities which 
would alleviate the debt. 

Barrett issued his report in 
June. 1978, to Johnson . 
Barrett's report portrayed a 
bleak fiscal picture and 
suggested several possible 
alternatives that would rectif.y 
the situation, ranging from a / 
complete shutdown of some of 
the eating facilities to 
implementing a 25% increase 
in price. 

Another oj the suggestions 
was to incorporate into HFS 
funds the money from those 
vending machines in close 
proximity to the snackbars. 
The rest of the revenue, 
compromising about half of the 
total, would continue to be used 
to fund student prograMS. 

Last summer. upon the 
recommendation of Johnson, 
McElroy decided to incor-
porate all the vending machine 
money into HFS funds.

(Continued from paJ(e 1") 
transaction. We've never had a 
large shortage or overage we 
couldn't account for com-
pletely," he concluded. 

At SDSU , where the 
disappearance was not even 
confirmed for 10 days, the 332 
students whose fees were 
missing are being called. Those 
who wrote checks are being 
asked to stop payment, with all 
bank charges paid by the 
school, and write another 
check. 

But an estimated $5,500 of the 
money was cash, and so cannot 
be recovered. 

KSDT 
(Continued from pa2e 1) 
-manager. The forum will be 
played over KSDT the week of 
Feb. 14. 

Although not intended as a 
debate, a moderator, Elain 
Moser of the ACLU, will be 
present at the forum. The 
Boycott Coors Committee 
representatives will be David 
Sickler, national coordinator, 
Evelyn Desmairas, Los 
Angeles area boycott director, 
and Bob Salas, striking worker. 
The Coors representatives will 
be Joe Benites, Coors 
Community relations mana-
ger, and Susan Booker, Coors

to the win column, defeating 
Brian Sours, 7-6, 6-4. 

Alex Rosenthal, playing in 
the number four singles 
position, lost a heartbreaker to 
State's Greg Bell, 7-5, 6-7, 6-4. 

In an exciting match in the 
number six slot Leigh Jackson 
overcame a first game loss and 
racked up the third point for the 
Tritons by beating Pete 
Butemayer, 2-6, 6-1, 6-4. 

Metsch and Hein lost their 
doublp.s match, 6-4, 7-5, giving 
State .:le go-ahead point. The

Davis and Tim Kilker. 

The ~econd doubles match, 
betweeJ I osentha lIRosenberg 
and V -i l MoezzilGreg Cale-

weathe . The Tritons took the 
first game, 7-6, am.! The Aztecs 
slipped by in the second, 5-7. 

"It "a a great howing by

be able to beat them.

last Friday wa rained out and 
resch dul d for a later date.
