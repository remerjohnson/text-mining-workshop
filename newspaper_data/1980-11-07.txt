UC Students: 

Are you content with the 
way this univer ity is run? 
How do you feel about the 
university renting out its 
name for nuclear weapons 
research over which it has no 
control? Do you think the 
university is doing enough to 
alleviate the statewide

you pleased with Affirmative 
Action policies that have 
resulted in an overall decline 
of Third World student 
enrollments in the last five 
years? Are you satisfied with 
the academic fare you are fed 
in the classroom? Would you 
like more control over the 
hiring and promotion of the 
cooks who serve it up? Do you 
mind that billions of dollars 
in the UC investment 
portfolio support South 
African apartheid and the 
nuclear power industry? 

If the e question stir your 
imagination, let me pose one

US hostages at crossroads of the Iranian revolution 
BY WILLIAM BEEMAN 

When do revolutions die? When 
the revolutionaries become the 
political establishment? 

That is what is very nearly 
happening in Iran today as their 
Parliament divides between those in 
the majority who would release the 
American hostages for political gain, 
and those in the minority faction 
who cling to the purist revolutionary 
principle of no compromise. 

The resulting impasse on the 
hostage issue marks an important 
watershed in the evolution of 
government in Iran's fledgling 
Islamic Republic. The hostages have 
become much more than a key to 
American military aid in the war 
against Iraq; the resolution of the 
hostage issue is now the delicate 
turning point between revolutionary 
idealism and political stability. 

A1readv the oolitical behavior of 
the Parliament recalls the kind of 
manipulation , obstruction and 
kowtowing to authority that 
characterized the informal politics 
during the time of the Shah. 

The parliamentary faction which 
opposes imminent release of the

at Brown University who has sjJent 
many years working in Iran, wrote 
this for the Pacific News Service. 

hostages is motivated, in part , by 
deep suspicions inspired by the 
parliamentary majority 's sudden 
turn·around on the issue. After 
months of vituperative rhetoric 
directed against the United States, 
the leaders of the majority Islamic 
Republican Party changed their tune 
and began to press for a quick 
resolution, Some majority leaders, 
like the Ayatollah Khalkhali , were 
extremely forthright about their 
mot ives: to influence the US election 
and to get US military aid , 

But there is another important 
motive that is not mentioned: The 
consolidation of the Parliament 's 
own political power, 

The Ayatollah Khomeini urged 
the situation forward several weeks 
ago when he out lined the four 
conditions to be met by the United 
St,ates for release of the hostages. 
But Khomeini set no deadlines, nor 
did he assert that the conditions 
were absolute. 

Khomeini thus provided the 
Parliament the opportunity to 
demonstrate that it could put its own 
signature on the release conditions 
and, furthermore , that it could iron 
out its differences and bring the 
si tuation to a speedy resolve. In other 
words, he encouraged ParEament to 
demonstrate to the nation that it can 
act independently in the interests of 

SDG&E: 
THE 

the nation, and -at the same time 
make a show of bringing the great 
Satan, America, to its knees, 

The majority leaders in t he 
Iranian Parliament have risen to this 
occasion. The need to act swift ly and 
deci sively , and thereby consolidate 
their power, is all the more urgent 
given the rising fortunes of their 
arch-enemy, President Abul Hassan 
Bani·Sadr, As the commander of the 
armed forces in the war with Iraq, he 
has won the praise of Khomeini 
himself, putting him beyond the 
reach of the criticisms of the 
parliamentary clerics. 

To establish and consolidate their 
political power in the legislatixe 
arena, the majority in Parliament 
has shown itself willing to cast off 
the robes of revolution for those of 
politics. 

But it is just this suggestion of 
compromise , this taint of 
revolutionary compromise, which 
has become the principal source of 
distrust among the parliamentary 
minority, They reason that the 
conditions laid down for the release 
of the hostages fall far short of the 
original demand: the return of the 
Shah and his wealth. The present 
conditions are, in fact , very weak ' 
demands , to be only partially 
complied with, and they have none of 
the defiant features of the original.

BRIGADE 

And, the holdouts might ask, who 
is bringing whom to their knees?The 
notion of helping Jimmy Carter -
who the Iranian government labeled 
"the chief enemy of the people of the 
world " - get re-elected hardly 
looked to anyone like bringing him to 
hi knees. 

Ra ther, it all seemed to add up to a 
sell -out of Islamic revolutionary 
principles in exchange for two 
immediate gains: protection of the 
status quo of the new power elite and 
US arms to beat off a foe which many 
Iranians believe was originally 
in spired by America. 

Because of these suspicions, the 
minority chose to remove all 
possibility of dealing by delaying the 
release until after both the American 
election and the war with Iraq . 

Thus, it was not surprising that 
this group in Parliament (about 66 
members - small, but enough to 
thwart a quorum by their absence) 
strictly refused to attend open 
parliamentarv deliberations, Any 
direct attack they might make on the 
conditions tor the hostage release 
would be characterized by figures 
such as Ayatollah Khalkhali as an 
attack on Khomeini himself, since 
the original conditions were put 
forth py him, Complete withdrawal 
was thus the only means of protest

'Fade to Black' is horrible 
Fans won't like lack of explicit violence 

BY LYNETTE TOM 
St.ff W riler 

The ads for Fade to Black, are mi leading. They 
show a man's face , half of which is made up as 
Dracula. In one mummified hand, he clutches a bag 
of popcorn and in the other (normal) one, a soft 
drink. 

The camera zooms in for a clo e·up and a 
woman's scream is heard, cau ing the bag of 
popcorn to shake. People will see it and flock to their 
nearest theatre, convinced th<!y' ll exit to the best 
horror movie this s ide of Motel Hell. 

They're in for a big surprise. 
The face belongs to Eric Binford. a timorous 

delivery boy who finds solace and s trength from 
watching film s. His escapism is justified , what with 
his predatory Aunt Stella, condescending employer 
Mr. Berger, haunting co-worker Sam and Ritchie. 

comful prost itute Dee Dee, a nd smug movie 
producer Gary Bialy terrorizing hi s real life in a 
never ending "B" picture. 

When they start to infringe upon his private 
celluloid world. Eric defends him elf the only way 
he knows how: masquerading as the characters 
from his favorite films. but the masquerades 
u ually end in murder. 

The screenplay by Vernon Zimmerman is a 
twisted telling of the Walter Mitty idea . He directs 
with a sha rp eye on media violence but a well 
developed black humor. 

Editor Howard Kunin's integration of excerpts 
from old movie with the footage of Fade 10 Blacll is 
clever and effective. 

The movie turns on Dennis Christopher's 
portrayal of Eric . He demonstrates that he has as 
much acting. potentia l for the psychological drama 

of Black as he .does for the teenage comedy of 
Breaking Away. 

He is joined by Tim Thomerson's performance as 
counselor Dr. Moriarity, which teeters between the 
hilariou ' Iy brilliant. uch as the scene in whi h he 
becomes a harmonica virtuoso via snorting cocai ne 
in his police department basement office. and the 
incredibly s tupid , such as when he sti ll pursue ' 
Eric when his initial humanistic appeal is ans wered 
with a gunshot. Of Linda Kerridge. it s hould be 
noted that in her. the ads don ' t lie. he looks and 
sounds a lot like Marilyn Monroe. 

Fade 10 Black isn 't a pleasant fi lm to watch. 
People wi ll be repu lsed by the open brutality of 
Eric's act ions but outraged by t he lack of any " real" 
shocks. But what 's more discomfort ing t han the 
medium 's power of suggestion over the human 
mind?

mostly I look for the people 
involved and for character 
who are significantl y 
different from the ones I' ve 
played. I like to do films that 
are away from the formu la -
most films today are just 
moronic and I don 't want to 
do that sort of stuff. " 

Although she did Blind 
A mibition for TV, she prefer 
working in film and would 
only go back to TV for an 
especially good script. "TV 
was a calcu lated thing," she 
explains, "I thought it would 
be a good movie and the part 
was unlike anything I had 
done. Plus it was opposite 
Martin Sheen." 

Russell would like to work 
with people who, as she likes 
to put it, "are always trying 
to throw the ball ahead. to 
take chances." Among the 
people she lists in this 
category are Bernardo 
Bertolucci, Francis Coppola, 
Jean·Luc Godard, Martin 
Scorsese and Nicolas Roeg, 
the director of Bad Tim;'lg. 

' 'I've always admired 
Roeg's work - his sort of 
bravery. Working with him 
in an actress·direct or 
relationship was wonderful. 
He wa alway there and 
a lways open to ideas. We 
didn't actually improvise 
scenes but he left it open so 
that as the character became 
clearer to me I could alway 
say she wouldn't do thi or 
s he might do that. " 

The role of Milena in Bad 
Timing is Russell's most 
challenging part to date, and 
she delivers a dazzling, multi· 
faceted performance. S.he 
describes the part With 
enthusiasm: "Milena wa 
interesting and exciti ng 
because s he was so complex 
and her range of emotion 
was more than I've ever had 
to do. The first day, though, 
was really difficult. I went 
back to my room and cried. I 
wanted to call my agent and 
say that I had bit off more 
than I could chew. But I got 
over that scared·shitless 
phase." 

Oddl y enough, Russell 
found Milena easier to play 
than Mo Dean. "Dean was 
more difficult. I really had to 
find things to identify with.

Swimmers 'fun meet' 
competition at SDSU 

BY JIM AGRONICK

travelled across town to San SO U com bined in groups of

strongly in the races against 
both the University of San 
Diego and SDSU. 

Since Morgan rearranged 
the relays to create equal 
teams, several relays had 
outstanding swims. Among 
these were the 200'yard 
med ley with Jackie van 
Egmond , Claudia O'Brien, 
Sandy Groos and Robin 
Osborne, and the 200·yard 
free·style relay of O'Brien, 
Groos, Osborne, and Mary 
Thorsness. Vicky Barker and 
Natalie Pierce contributed 
strong individual perform· 
ances. 

The women's team lost 
two good divers from last 
year's Quad, but if Maureen 
Kavanaugh's Saturday 
performance is any indica· 
tion, the loss of the others 
wi ll not be too significant. 

The men 's team, swim· 
ming against SDSU , 
competed well for this early 
in the season. Typically 
SDSU dominates the early 
season meets, but the Tritons 
surprised the Aztecs with 
win in the BOO·tree·style, 
400·fly, and 400·back relays. 

Kevi n Lingle, Steve Beal 
and Doug Smith did well in 
the butterfly, while Joe 
Hernandez a nd freshman 
Greg Doya dominated the 
freestyle swims. 

Satu rday was also a good 
day for breastrokers as Steve 
Best. Don Edgar and 
fresh man Dave Reed all had 
successful swi ms. 

As with the women 's 
teams, there was so me 
skepticism about whether 
UCSD would have any 
st rength in the diving 
contests, but newcomer 
Derek Dou~lass surprised

cro ing campus has not yet

adding that "the number 30

due to the decrease in on-

Noise complaints are 
nothing new, said Umstead, 
who believes "it's been 
building up over a period of 
time, Recently, l've been 
getting quite a bit of pressure 
from the Chancellor' 
complex. I've been asked to 
come up with a solution, and 
although I'd rather see it stay 
this way, it looks like the 
change will go throught." 

Alternative on-campu 
tran portation service is a 
"long range" project that "is 
too cost ly to initiate now," 
said Umstead, 

"The problem with a 
shuttle service, one sug-
gestion we've considered, is 
that no cross roads link 
Warren campus with the 
other college campuses," he 
said, "A shuttle would have 
to go all the way around

Timing, Milena had so many 
transitional scenes, so many 
peaks that it didn't matter if 
some big scenes got cut 
because there was so much 
left. " 

Although Russell's acting 
has received considerable 
attention, her films have not 
always been well· treated by 
the studios, Her performance 
opposite Dustin Hoffman in 
Straight Time won praise but 
the liIm got lost in the studio 
shuffle. 

"It wa a good little film 
and I was upset that the 
studio di str ibuted it so 
poorly. If it had been given a 
chance it would have found 
an audience. But I have no 
control over these things." 

When asked about 
initiat ing projects herself and 
the possibility of directing, 
she was a little hesitant in 
responding. "Maybe ·in a 
couple of years I'd consider 
initiating projects but not 
right now. And I'm not really

It happened to secretaries first . Then lawyers. bookkeepers. 
cabbies. housewives, and businessmen succumbed to the beauty of our 
Pilot Razor Point and Finellner pens. 

Some people felt it was sick to get so emotionally Involved with our 
pens. But is it really so crazy to love a Pilot Razor Point pen that writes with 
a sharp smooth line and costs a mere 79C?ls it nuts to flip over Its unique 
little metal collar that smartly helps to keep its point from going squish? 

If It Is crazy. it's going to surprise a whole lot of people. In fact, we 
understand that Pilot Razor Point even has what it takes to score extra 
points with football players. 

It also comes to our attention that many 
coaches are fans of the Pilot Flnellner. 
Along with all the other Razor 
Point features. the 69C 
Pilot Finellner has 
the strength and 
drive to go through carbons. [PILOT] It's hard to resist a pen 
that holds the line like a Pilot. fineIne maier pens

Seymour - as beautiful and elegant 
as always - star in the story of a man 
for Vv'hom a picture is worth far more 
than a thousand words. Reeve is a 
~ung playwright who falls in IoYe 
with the picture of an actress from

For American, it i 
difficult to conceive of figures 
uch a "Hanging Judge" 

Ayatollah adegh Khalkhali 
in a po ition equivalent to 
House Speaker Tip O'Neil or 
minority leader Robert Byrd. 
but the analogy is not too far· 
fetched . Khalkhali and other 
parliamentary leader are 
learning that running a 
government i a lit! Ie 
different from running a 
revolution. Wherea revolu· 
tionaries ne d not com pro-
mi e their ideals. politician 
almo t always have to. 

The cleric were warned of 
thi by the late revolutionary 
leader Ayatollah Taleghani 
who urged the mullahs to 
e chew politics. According to 
Taleghani, the floor of 
Parliament is no pIa e for a 
piritual leader who hould 
erve as the best example of 

moral rectitude for hi s 
follower . Americans already 
know that legislator can 
rarely fill that role. 

Thus, Iranian clerical 
leader hip ha painted it elf 
into a corner. The proce s of 
asserting and maintaining its 
po ition i opening the 
leader to the same charges of 
collusion, capitulation and 
compromi e they levied 
again t others at an earlier 
tage of th revolution . Th y 

may have gained enough 
trength to prevail and bring 

their opposition into line. But 
the po sibility of their 
suffering the fate of their

parts, Robe pierre and

Iran 's Islamic Revolution

joke. But it's an intriguing 
idea." 

Russell has a couple of 
projects in the works but she 
says that none of them are 
really definite enough to talk 
about. 

Russell's latest film, Bad 
Timing can currently be seen 
at the Guild Theatre. 

Anti-draft 
"Involuntary military 

induction may seem rather 
remote at this time, but it 
poses a real threat to many 
young people," says UCSD's 
Draft Registration Informa-
tion Coordinator Mary Virga. 

But registration for men 
born in 1962 is just over two 
months away and Virga feel 
that it is "important that all 
students. male and female , 
become informed on the 
present draft registration 
process and the possible 
consequences of registering."
