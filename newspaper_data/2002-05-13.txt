Pride week hits campus 
Out and Proud 
events observe 
queer identities 
By ALUSON FORD 
Contributing Writer 

Members and supporters of the 
lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgen-
dered community gathered in 
Revelle Plaza at noon May 9 to 
begin a march throughout campus 
as part of Out and Proud V/eek. 

The LGBTA focuses on pro-
moting the understanding of gen-
der and sexuality issues and provid-
ing resources and support for those 
who need them. 

The organization began Out 
and Proud Week week on May 4 
with the third annual Queer Youth 
conference. The conferenr.e 
focused on offering support to local 
queer teens and was followed by a 
dance at Porter!> Pub. The rest of 
the week was filled with film screen-
ings, including "Ma Vie En Rose" 
and "The Laramie Project," a Big 
Gay Picnic, a drag show, various 
speakers and two alliance trainings. 

In addition to these events, a 
booth was maintained on Library 
Walk all week to provide informa-
tion about the LGBT community. 

The Out and Proud march fol-
lowed a path that led past Main 
Gym, through the Srudent Center, 
down Library Walk and into the 
Price Center. 

About 30 marchers, many 
decked out in rainbow-printed gear, 
chanted slogans such as, "We're 
here, we're queer. We refuse to live

eN A approves nurse strike 
Union contests UC's current merit-pay program 
By KYLE R. BIEBESHEIMER 
Senior Staff Writer 

Over 95 percent of the 8,000-
member California Nurses 
Association voted May 7 and May 
8 to approve a nurses strike in the 
UC health care system. 

The vote allows labor repre-
sentatives of CNA to call a one-
day strike if necessary, provided 

. they give 10 days notice to the 
University of California. 

Should a strike occur, the 
effects could be felt at public 

health care facilities throughout 
the state, including medical cen-
ters at UCLA, UC San Francisco, 
UC Irvine, UC Davis and UCSD. 

The potential of a nursing 
strike would affect not only the 
UCSD Medical Center's Hillcrest 
and Thornton hospitals, but also 
the Student Health Center and 
nearly a dozen members of its 
nursing staff. 

According to CNA representa-
tives, the heart of the dispute 
between the University of 
California and ~NA deals with

the present method for determin-

University officials contend 
that the "merit-pay program," a 
performance-based compensation 
program currently used by the 
University of California, attempts 
to reward hard-working nurses 
who demonstrate quality patient 
care with increases in pay. 

CNA is fighting to end the 
merit-pay program because it 
feels it unfairly rewards some

Cake to headline 
Sun God festival 
Delay caused by contract issues 
By CHARUE TRAN 
Senior Staff Writer 

The AS. programming office has 
announced the band lineup for the 
Sun God Festival, with alternative 
band Cake headlining this year's 
concert May 17 at RIMAC field. 

Bank- of the Bands winner Five 
Crown will open the concert. They 
will be followed by punk band No 
Use for a Name and hip-hop group 
Nocturnal. 

The announcement of the lineup 
was made during the week of the fes-
tival, which was later than usual. A.S. 
co-festival coordinators Brandon 
Freeman and Mike Hayes cited sev-
eral reasons for the delay. 

"It took'a long time to get the act 
... It was well-known that we had a 
fairly large budget, but it's been a 
tough time to get acts," Hay.'!S said. 
"We were panicking, but we mew it 
would all work out in the end." 

A larger budget for the festival 
was also a factor in the delay this 
year. 

"We tried really, really hard. 
ow that we had the budget, we can 

look for rock/alternative headlin-
ers," Freeman said. "That's the rea-
son it took so long." 

Sacramento-based Cake, who 
recently released the album 
"Comfort Eagle," are well-known 
for their quirky alternative rock 
music. They are best known for 
their song "Never There," as well as 
their cover of Gloria Gaynor's "I 
Will Survive." 

"I think it's going to be fun," said 
former A.S. commisioner of pro-
gramming Eisha Christian. "[Cake) 
is headlining XFest, so they're going 
to be really cool. They have a pretty 
cool show and a long set. I'm excit-
ed!" 

Christian was happy to have not 
only a high-profile headliner, but 
also one that is known for its high-
quality set. 

"Cake is more about the perfor-
mance than for being popish,"

UCSD pays tribute 
to TMC freshman 
Kumar remembered at vigil 
By KIRSTEN HUBBARD 
Staff Writer 

Hundreds of UCSD students 
and faculty attended a candlelight 
vigil Wednesday in memory of 
Paras Kumar, a Thurgood 
Marshall College freshman who 
died along with three family 
members in a fire at his home in 
Hollywood Hills, Calif., on May 
4. 

The vigil was held in the 
evening at the quad below 
Oceanview Terrace restaurant, 
where a stage was assembled. 

Students attending the vigil 
pinned commemorative yellow 

ribbons to their shirrs and each 
carried a candle, which was cere-
monially lit by the members of 
Marshall college'S F building, 
Kumar's former residency. 

"We all have our own experi-
ences with Paras that we hold 
deep inside," said Kumar's build-
ing resident adviser Liza Okazaki 
as she held back tears. 

Many students used the oppor-
tunity to tell everyone in the 
crowd what they enjoyed about 
their friend.

Nurse: 
Officials: strike will impact 
Student Health Services 
Continued from page 1 
nurses, while ignoring others who 
work just as hard . 

In place of the current system, 
CNA hopes to introduce a new system 
that uses length of nursing experience 
as the sole factor for determining pay 
increases for UC nurses. 

Many nurses contend that the 
merit-pay program currently in use is 
far roo biased and that the evaluations 
of work ethics are not objective 
enough, CNA representatives say. 

Paul Schwartz, spokesman for the 
University of California, disagrees. 

"We feel that [merit pay] is the best 
way to properly reward nurses who 
deliver excellent nursing and quality 
patient care," he said 

Schwartz is critical of the seniority-
based pay system proposed by CNA. 

"The union wants strictly a senior-
ity-based system that doesn't take into 
consideration quality of work perfor-
mance, and we just don't think that's 
appropriate." 

Schwartz says that support behind 
CNA is not unanimous among UC 
nurses. 

"While some nurses obviously sup-
port the union's position, there are 
UC nurses that do not, and would not 
want to see us abandon the merit sys-
tem," he said . 

Othcr points of contention between 
the two parties include staffing, 
mandatory overtime and full contract 
protections for per diem nurses who 
work on an as-needed basis. 

C A representatives maintain that 
many nurses say they feel that they 
have been too passive over the past few 
years in making their demands known 
to the University of California. Last 
weeks vote in support of striking, they 
said, was seen as a wake-up call. 

Fran Burns, a registered nurse at 
UCSD Medical Center, was pleased 
with last week's vote. 

"Nurses have been afraid to speak 
up because of repercussions," Burns 
sa id. "But now with the union being so 
lTluch stronger a:td so much more sup-
portive, nurses are at the point where 
they're saying, 'O.K., yeah, I have the 
backing so I am going to express my 
needs, and the needs for the patients.'" 

Dr. Brian Murray, director of 
Studcnt Health Services at UCSD, 
acknowledged the impact a nursing 
strike would have on students. 

"If the nurses go out on strike, it 
would impact delivery of health ser-
vices at Student Health," Murray said. 
"Although the quality of care would 
not be impacted, care would not be 
provided as efficiently or in as rapid a 
manner. Students should expect signif-
icantly longer waits and deferment of 
some health care [such as physical 
exams] if the nurses go out on strike." 

Charles Idelson, a spokesman for 
C A, recognizes the general senti-
ment felt by nurses employed at 
UCSD Medical Center and their col-
leagues throughout the UC system. 

"There's a lot of nurses at UC San 
Diego. They, like nurses throughout 
the UC system, are very displeased 
with the position that the administra-
tion has taken.» 

Idelson feels that last week's vote in 
support of a strike reflects the over-
whelming degree of frustration felt by 
UC nurses and the need to take action 
against their employers. 

"I think the outrage the nurses are 
expressi ng in the university system 
indicates a very large number of nurs-
es are fed up with the administration 
and feel they need to make a strong 
statement," Idelson said. 

Although the University of 
California and the CNA are far from 
resolving their dispute, Idelson is opti-
mistic that a fair settlement can be 
reached in the coming days without 
the need for a strike. 

"A strike would only be used as a 
last resort. We do have more negotia-
tions [this] week, and there's no reason 
why the University of California can-
not reverse its disastrous course and 
treat its nurses fairly." 

Talks ~tween the two sides will 
resume thi; week.

SIO professor receives one of 
15 awards at White House 

Charles David Keeling. a professor of oceanogra-
phy at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, has 
been selected by President George W. Bush as one 
of 15 recipients of the National Medal of Science, the 
nation's highest award for lifetime achievement in 
scientific research. 

Keeling. who has been affiliated with Scripps 
since 1956, will receive the medal at the White 
House later this month. 

Keeling is a world leader in research on the car-
bon cycle and the increase of carbon dioxide in the 
atmosphere. He was the first to definitively deter-
mine the fraction of carbon dioxide accumulating in 
the atmosphere from combustion. 

Keeling has also studied the role of oceans in 
modulating the atmospheric concentration of carbon 
dioxide by carrying out extremely accurate measure-
ments of carbon dissolved in seawater.

Education bond proposals 
find place on future ballots 

The placement of bond measures for public edu-
cation facilities has been approved for the November 
2002 and March 2004 ballots by Gov. Gray Davis 
and the Califomia Legislature. 

Under AB 16, the bill signed by Davis, the 2002 
bond measure would provide $13.05 billion for K-12 
and higher education facilities over a two-year peri-
od. The 2004 measure would provide an additional 
$12.3 billion over the following two years. 

If both measures meet with voter approval, UC 
campuses would receive $345 million per year to 
fund capital improvement projects to all UC cam-
puses, including the new UC Merced campus. 

UC projects that .will be funded by lease-revenue 
bonds on an accelerated basis have already been 
approved. One such project is Engineering Building 
3B at UCSD. Other buildings include Veterinary 
Medicine 3A at UC Davis, Natural Sciences Unit 2 at 
UC IlVine, Engineering Building Unit 2 at UC 
Riverside, Life Sciences Building at UC Santa Barbara, 
Engineering Building at UC Santa Cruz, and site 
development and infrastructure at UC Merced.

A new bill 
requires 
identification from 
first-time voters, 
which may 
disenfranchise 
students and 
some 
minority 
groups 

At least something good has corne from the 2000 presi-denti al election debacle : the passing of the Equal Protection of Voting 
Rights Act of 200 I. 

The legislation contains basic 
changes at the federal, state and 
local levels to protect voters and 
to improve election administra-
tion. 

The new legislation , passed 
April II, requires first-time vot-
ers to show verification of local 
residency. The original proposal was 
altered many times to suit bipartisan 
agreement. While the result is far from 
ideal, it contains elements that may improve 
our nation's electoral system. 

The bill sets electoral standards in three 
basic areas. 

First, voting standards will ensure that 
voters can confirm and correct their ballots, as 
well as be notified of overvotes. 

Second, the bill allows for provisional ballots. This 
means that if a voter's name is not found on the regis-
tration list at the polls, or if other problems occur, the 
voter can still cast a ballot, which will be counted if 
the voter's eligibility is thereafter verified. 

And third, th e legislation requires voter registra-
tion lists. 

Buried in the compromised version of the bill 
lies the voter identification requirement, which 
Imny believe will undermine the voting capabilities 
of certain votin g populations. 

It i important to consider what we are giving up 
with ItS pa~sage . 

T he identi fication req uirement has raised ques-
tions about efficiency. Students, especially those who 
are away from home, are concerned about their right 
to vote. While they would still be allowed to vote in 
their hometown, their ability to vote in elections 
while away at college would be raken away if they do 
not have a legal form of 10 that confirms their actual 
residence at college. This raises concerns about the 
added hassles people have to go th rough to prove 
their rt ght to vote . 

Sen. Christopher Bond, a Republican from 
Missouri, believes that requtrt ng 1D is no such 
has Ie. "Ninety percent of adult Americans have a 
driver's Itcense ," he said . "You have to show an ID to get on a plane, 
to rent a video, to buy cigarettes. Why can't you have some minimal 
identification to assure that you are a live human being, entitled to 
vote and entitled to vote only once in every important election?" 

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Pat leung/Goordion 

or 

Others believe that the bill will ha ve 
adverse effects on minority and student pop-

ulations, as well as the poor. Sen. Tom 
Daschle , a Democrat from South Dakota, said 

he believes that there will end lip being 
"millions of people today who are not going 

to get to vote because they don 't have a 
photo 10, because they don't have any 

means of showing identification through 
ownership," or in any case, a verifiable proof 

of residence. 
While there is little debate over whether we 

need electoral reforms, the ID requirement 
will foster more fraud than ever. Many people 
say they want to prevent felons or undocu-
mented immigrants from voting illegally. 

However, this legislation does not prevent such 
people from voting; false identification is easy to 
come by and easy to make . If a felon were able to 
obtain a fake 10, nowhere on the card would it 
be verifiable that the cardholder was a felon. 

The ID requirement also presents an admin-
istrative problem. 

There will be thousands of low-income, elder-
ly, homeless, minority and student voters who 
must make special arrangements to vote. Undt:r 
this legislation, even registered voters would have 
to find an open Department of Motor Vehicles 
office to get a state-issued identification card. This 
would present a major problem for those who are 
not easily mobile and cannot just drive to the 
DMV to get an ID. Imagine the hundreds of 
thousands of tax dollars that would have to be 
spent to prevent voter fraud - a task that 
should be left in the hands of those who are 
working the polls. What many seem to want is 
not a complete overhaul of tlle electoral sys-
tem, but more competent poll workers. 

Furthermore, the bill may also result in 
discriminatlon. What advocates of the bill 

don't realize is that voting is a funda-
mental right that should not be bur-
dened by any other requirement. We 

need identification to drive, to get 
on a plane and to rent a ~;deo 
because those are not rights 
clearly guaranteed by the 

"Constitution. Voting is the 
essence of an individual's social 

and political participation in a democracy; it is part of a citizen's liveli-
hood. 

By supporting this piece of legislation, we are supporting the dis-
enfra nchisement of everyone's right to vote, not only the rights of 
students, minorities or the poor.

C\I{({IE ELlZ .. \[>ETII ~KLAR 

W e a \I know that there is a lot of 
dating protocol. 

For example, do not spit on 
your date unless specifically 
requested to do so by said person. 
Do not mention how good his or 
her sibling is in bed. And my per-
sonal favorite : Do not promise ro 
call, even though there is no way in 
hell you would ever go out with the 
same transvestite twice. 

Clearly, we are saturated with 
rules about how to act on a date. 
But you know what our society is 
seriously lacking' Some sort of 
protocol that lets you know when 
you are being asked out in the first 
place. 

If you think about it, thi s is cru-
cial to the whole dating experience. 
You can't know whether it's ris!.." to 
eat garlic unless you first know 
whetl}er you are in fact on a date . 

So how are you supposed to 
know when you're being asked 
out' Most of you ha\'e figured out 
from past experiences that it 's 
nearly impossi bl e to know for 
sure. 

Say a guy asks a girl if she 
wants to study with him. [s that a 
date ? . 

Let's examine thi s from all 
sides. It 's studying, which is 
school - related and not at all 
romantic. But, if they go to a cof-
fee shop - a p lace clearly off 
campus and thus part of the out-
side, potential dating world -
does that make it a date' What if 
he buys her coffee? What if they 
have a non-schaal-related conver-
sation? 

There is nothing worse than 
thinking you are on a date when 
the person you're with barely regis-
ters that he or she could sleep with 
you - except maybe that feeling 
you get when you really want to 
sneeze but can't, because that is 
pretty awful, too. 

This is why there clearly needs 
to be some sort of standard way to 
ask people out. (And also some sort 
of sneeze-inducer.) 

Understandably, guys rarely 
want to blatantly say, "Hey, wanna 
go Out on a date with me'" 
Phrasing it like that really doesn't 
give 3 girl much room for an easy 
letdown. All you're really aski ng 
for tllere is a straight yes or no, and 
a no would suck. 

Men, being the uitraprotective 
nurturers of their egos that they 
are, have developed a way of aski ng 
girls to do thIngs with them in uch 
a way that it is never reall y clear 
whether it 's a date. That . way, 
should the girl say no, he can 
always pretend he never asked her 
out. 

That's all well and good, and I 
rea lly do have sympathy for tile 
gutS it must take to ask out another 
human being. 

But it is time for a change. 
\Nomen want it to be clear when 
we are being asked on dates. We 
want to know what is expectCi:d of 
us, and we want to know what we 
can expect from you - which, by 
the way, will always be more than

you should have to give. 
In other words, we want you to 

shove your egos up your asses. 
When a guy wants to ask a girl 

out for a date - any old kind will 
do - he should recite certain lines 
that will allow his female interest to 
understand his intentions and then 
respond accordingly. First, the set-
up: 

Guy: I really want to see 
"Spider-Man" this weekend. 

Girl : Yeah, me too. 
Good! The girl is showing 

interest and indicating that the two 
could potentially participate in a 
mutual activity. 

Guy: Well, I was thinking about 
going tomorrow night. Do you 
want to come with me? 

OK. here is where we will inserr 
the standard dating ritual that I 
propose should be part of every 
conversation of this nature. 

Guy: Should you respond in the 
affirmative, I will take that to mean 
you find me an attractive male 
specimen and will be consenting to 
a date with me. To answer yes and 
go out with me, say "yes" now. To 
turn me down, say "no" and then 
walk quickly away so you don 't see 
me uneasily try to recover my man-
hood. 

See? Was that so hard? Of 
course not. 

Now all the girl has to do is 
make a choice, and the whole thing 
is serrIed. No confusion, no small 
talk. 

So basically, I urge you all to use 
my patented Date Request 
Protocol model to help make the 
world an easier place for both sexes 
to live in. But don't use it to ask 
someone to see "Spider-Man" with 
you - it sucked.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 5 

Rediscover the joys of personal interaction 
Pernicious AOL Instant Messenger addiction wastes time 
By EVELYN HSIEH 
Contributing Writer 

It's 4:37a.m. and I am still up. 
The sun will rise in about 90 
minutes, and I am still awake on 
a Tuesday morning. No, I am not 
studying for a midterm, and no, 1 
am not an insomniac. 

The only reason I am not 
asleep is that my computer 
screen is filled with little flashing 
boxes. Has college life come to 
this? 

Internet chat programs are 
ubiquitous on college campuses, 
connecting students - and in 
some cases, controlling and con-
suming students as well. This 
brilliant system created by 
America Online, which was later 
copied by Yahoo and Microsoft, 
is convenient, wasteful and 
downright addicting all at the 
same time. 

Thousands of UCSD students 
can relate. The little ring of a 
newly sem message or the sound 
of a closing door signaling the 
departure of a "buddy" is never 
absent from some room in my 
suite. 

Instant messaging programs' 
omnipresence stems from the 
perfectly innocent motive of 
everybody trying to keep in 
touch. In the few years since its 
inception, AOL's version has 
infiltrated the daily lives of co[- . 
lege students everywhere. 

Of course, it's a handy tool 
that allows everybody with a 
computer and Internet access to 
instantly talk to anybody they 
want, whether they are 10 feet 
away or 10,000 miles away, all for 
free. In a microwave popcorn, 
drive-thru society, AOL Instant 

Messenger takes the cake in ful-
filling instant gratification. 

However, A.I.M. can quickly 
stop being a chain of communica-
tion and start being a chain 
between you and your computer. 
This goes back to the features of 
A.I.M. itself: With profiles, away 
messages, file transfers, buddy 
icons - and now subprofiles, 
"friend" quizzes and other add-
ons - A.I.M. has 

behind in classes as a result of 
spending quality time with his 
keyboard instead of with hi s 
books. A.I .M. can be counterpro-
ductive and even damaging. 

A friend of mine deleted 
A.I.M. from his computer alto-
gether because he thought it was 
an excessive waste of time and a 
breeding ground for gossip, 
among other things. One small 

step backward for 
become a 
labyrinth of per-
sonal informa-
tion, quirky quo-
tations and grist 
for the rumor 
mill. 

It has also 
spawned its own 
kind of langUage, 
where emotion 
icons and 
onslaughts of 
"hehe" dot every 
conversation. 

The little ring of a 
newly sent 

message or the 
sound of a closing 
door signaling the 

departure of a 
"buddy" is never

room in my suite. 

time stamps, one 
giant leap forward 
for time manage-
ment. It would 
take more than 
sheer willpower 
for an extreme 
user to do such a 
thing. 

After an 
extended period 
of heavy usage, I 
decided to give up 
A.I .M. for a 

With so many 
different features, A.I.M. is no 
longer just a matter of signing on 
and chatting away. I spend a good 
chunk of time reading my friend 's 
brother's cousins profile when I 
should be reading for class. 

A paradoxical situation exists: 
A.I.M. is a simple communication 
medium that is complex at the 
same time. The majority of 
A.I.M. conversations are pretty 
pointless, and doubly so when you 
can talk to the person face to face. 

It also devours your time 
faster than standing in line at 
Disneyland during the Christmas 
season. At the very least, instant 
messaging eats up a few hours. At 
the most extreme, a chronic user 
not only loses sleep but also falls 

month . 
Depending on 

whom I told, this was either no 
big deal or the equivalent of quit-
ting a five -pack-a-day cigarette 
habit cold turkey. It had started 
to disgust me when I saw people 
visit CLICS with an armful of 
books during finals week, only to 
sign onto A.I.M. Express as soon 
as they hit a computer. 

If you really look into the 
impact of this seemingly harmless 
A.I.M. addiction, perhaps you will 
also see the detriment it cau.~es. As 
for me, whenever I signed on, I 
knew I was gone. Four, five, six 
hours would pass. Besides acade-
mic troubles, I wasn't doing too 
well spirituaJly or healthwise. 

I lI1ay sound like was an 
anomalous case of A.I.M. mad-

ness, but believe me, I didn't go 
on nearly as much as others I 
knew. 

At first, quitting was difficult; 
the little yellow running man (the 
A.I.M. icon) would be~kon me at 
the bottom of the screen . JUSt one 
click, and I'd be able to chat away 
with [50 buddies. Then I redi s-
covered that talking to people face 
to face was a lot easier to interpret 
than trying to differentiate:! 
between "You're stupid," and 
"Haha!! U r so stupid! Hee!" 

I finally invested time in those 
overpriced books that I bought 
and hadn't glanced at before. I 
spent more time visiting people 
than checking away messages. I 
did feel a littl e more out of the 
loop, but hey - I wasn't a slave 
to my computer. 

I wish I could say that A.I.M. 
isn't so controlling anymore. It is 
the nature of A.I.M. to be con-
suming. It's just too easy to get 
caughr up in charting. It's roo 
easy to keep those buddies you 
met once and never, ever talk to 
on your list . It's too easy to type 
whatever you want and hit 
"Enter." And admittedly, 1 suc-
cumb to this ease more often 
than not. 

However, I pose a challenge 
to all students out there who can 
be honest enough to admit that 
the prevalence of A.I.M. in col-
lege is not so healthy. Get away 
from your desktop and allow the 
California sunshine to once again 
bathe your now pasty-as-a -
result-of-IMing-too-much body. 
Use your voice instead of your 
mouse. For once , sink out of 
aimlessness and sink into 
A.I.M.lessness . Heaven forbid, 
you might actually have a decent

Panel to evaluate campus noise 
Racket from construction, skateboards to be studied 
By TOM NEELEY 
Staff Writer 

In response to several com-
plaints about noise on campus, the 
Committee on Campus and 
Community Environment has 
established the Noise Work 
Group, an ad hoc committee to 
examine and identify noise prob-
lelll5 at UCSD. 

Allen Ryan, professor of surgery 
at the UCSD School of Medicine, 
chairs the group. He said the com-
mittee was loolcing to better under-
stand noise at UCSD. 

"What we want to do is to make 
recommendations for the campus 
that would allow the campus to 
understand the advantage of noise 
in the best possible way," Ryan said. 
"Certainly the committee realizes 
that there is bad noise and good 
noise." 

There have been around 150 
responses to the CCCE's initial e-
mail to the UCSD community 
regarding noise. These have cited 
construction sites, televisions in 

Pride: 
Students reflect on 
lifestyle at open mic 
Continued from page 1 

in fear l " The group attracted a wide 
range of reactions, from blank stares 
to cheers, as well as hugs and high 
fives from passing students. 

At the Price Center, a stage was 
set up where members and allies of 
the LGBT comrnnity were given 
the chance to speak out in front of 
the large lunch crowd. 

The open mic produced a variety 
of speakers, all enthusiastically 
cheered on by the crowd gathered 
on the steps. 

Wesley Fujimoto introduced the 
event by providing some context. 

"People ask, why do we have to 
be out there, why don 't we just keep 
quiet, why isn't there a straight 
awareness day, straight pride? Every 
fucking day of the year is straight 
pridc," Fujumoto said. 

Other students spoke of past 
experiences of fear and uncertainty, 
while others simply wanted to thank 
friends and lovers for their support. 

"1 want you to carry my chil-
dren," one female spealcer told her 
girlfriend, who was sitting in the 
audience. 

Many speakers spoke of having 
had trouble in the past, either com-
ing to tenns with their sexuality or 
finding the support that they need-
ed. But everyone who addressed the 
crowd was optimistic about the past 
week and the funlfe of the LGBT 
community. 

"There's a lot of people who are 

dining halls, slate boards and leaf 
blowers as sources of noise, among 
others. 

"There were lots of complaints 
on various sources of noise, and 
they were very broad," Ryan said. 
"There were a few people who 
either were not bothered or felt 
there wasn't enough noise on cam-
pus. They felt this campus is dead." 

Ryan stressed that students need 
to feel free to make noise. 

"In my personal view, students 
need to have noise; they need to 
have the ability to make noise," he 
said. "What we don't want is to 
have a locked down campus where 
students don't feel free to express 
themselves. Noise is an important 
part of student life. 

"On the other hand, there are 
times in which noise is inappropri-
ate. especially around dwelling 
areas and offices," he said. 

Ryan emphasized that students 
are not the only source of noise. 

"There are a lot of other sources 
of noise that have nothing to do 
with students," he said. 

The Noise Work Group, which 
can only recommend policy, will 
forward its findings and conclu-
sions to the Academic Senate and 
the administration, which ultimate-
ly makes policy. 

Emily Mah, an Eleanor 
Roosevelt College junior, is uncon-
cerned about noise on campus. 

"I think the campus is fairly 
quiet with the students and every-
thing because everyone's pretty 
mellow here," she said. 

Warren sophomore Robert 
Barreca agreed. 

"I don't think there's any noise. 
There are no people making 
noise," he said. "No one on campus 
is doing anything super crazy." 

Ultimately, Ryan underscored 
the intentions of the committee to 
help manage future campus 
growth. 

"What we want to do is help the 
campus ... provide recommenda-
tions that will help the campus 
manage noise so that it doesn't 
become a problem in the future," 
he said.

guess what, we're growing." Brian 
Latham said. 

However, members did acknowl-
edge that not all feedback had been 
positive. 

"There's a lot more Icnowledge 
and awareness, but at the same time, 
complementary to that, there's a lot 
more anti-LGBT activity going on 
- a lot of people who are vocally 

against our politics - that are very 
uncomfortable that we're here on 
campus," said Mike l<Jiuhnann, who 
has been involved in LGBTA for the 
past three years. 

Overall, he is happy with the 
organizations progress. 

"We're a lot more visible, a lot 
louder and a lot more proud than 
we have been in past years," 
JUufmann said.

Student panel to advise on 
University Center projects 
Officials seek input on Price Center expansion 
8y LAURA McGANN 
Staff Writer 

With plans to expand the Price 
Center and renovate the Srudent 
Center in the works, the University 
Centers and an A.S. Council task 
force are seeking studeP.t input. A 
series of focus groups will convene 
this week to elicit srudents' desires 
and needs for the expanded facilities. 

"The goal is to get a basic sense 
of how students use the facilities 
now and what can be improved," 
said University Centers Advisory 
Board Chair and UCAB represen-
tative to the task force James 
Lynch. 

Each session will be geared 
toward certain campus groups, 
ranging from commuters to gradu-
ate students to student organiza-
tions. 

Consulting firm Brailsford and 
Dunlavey is being brought in to 
assist the task force in assessing 
student opinion on campus and 
whether a referendum could be 
supported at UCSD . Opinions 
gathered during the focus groups 
taking place this week will playa 
part in assessing student opinion. 

"This company is going to tell 
us whether or not to go for it, they 
may tell us not to do it," said Task 
Force Chair Mark Stickel.

relayed anecdotes from his friend-
ship with Kumar. He ended on an 
emotional note. 

"Everybody was his friend," 
Shlueter-Corey said . "It didn't 
matter how well he Imew you or 
you Imew him. He cared.» 

Kumar was described as a gen-
erous, funny person who loved his 
family. 

"He was probably one of the 
most generous, loving people in 
the world," another speaker said . 
"He had a joke for everything." 

Another speaker agreed, 
"When I picture his face, I can 
always hear his voice. He was so 
funny. I'll really miss him and his 
presence in our building." 

If students do not support a ref-
erendum for expansion, it is 
unclear whether the expansion will 
go ahead. 

"Either we will have to live with 
what we have in a growing student 
population or other units in sru-
dent affairs would have to suffer to 
pay for it," Lynch said. 

The planned expansion, if 
enacted, would require student

Student fees, however, will not be 
used until the expansion is com-

said. "The earliest a fee would

Kumar liked to go home on 
weekends and spend time with his 
family and friends from high 
school, according to his friends. 

The Kumars' relatives claim 
that Kumar's father, Harish, had 
been excited about his son's arrival 
home the weekend of the fire. He 
discovered the blaze upon arriving 
at his house from a trip to 
Bakersfield, Calif. and immediate-
ly called 911. 

Kumar is survived by his 
father, Harish. 

His mother, Gita; his grand-
mother, Sitaben Patel ; and his 16-

will be voting on a new fee referen-
dum. 

"We would need srudent com-
mitment in order to begin," Lynch 
said. 

The facilities need to be 
expanded because the current space 
will be inadequate when the cam· 
pus population increases in coming 
years, according to Lynch. 

Current expansion plans have 
the Price Center growing eastward 
to the area currently held by the 
police station. The station would 
move into a new facility in the 
Campus Services Complex, which 
is at the intersection of Gilman 
Drive and Voigt Drive. 

More commuter lounge space, 
offices for student organizations 
and increased dining seating are 
parts of the plan for the Price 
Center. 

The Srudent Center's renova-
tion plan calls for more seating at 
the Grove Cafe and improvements 
to The Stage at Porter's Pub. 

Students wishing to attend these 
sessions should send an e-mail to 
ctmlith@ucsd.tdu or call (858) 534-
0818 to reserve a space. 

Police have not identified any sus-
pects. 

For now, Kumar's friends at 
UCSD are still mourning. 

At the end of the vigil, every-
one in the crowd Imelt while 
songs such as Bop. 11 Men 's 
"Yesterday" were played in dedi -
cation to the memory of Kumar. A 
large screen illustrated scenes 
from his life and friendships while 
many students wept. 

"If you could sum up Paras in 
one word, I keep thinking of 'live-
ly,''' said Evan Campbell, a 
Warren freshman and suitemate 
of Kumar's. "He had an aura of 
confidence, style and passion. It 
was a pleasure to be his friend. I 
learned a lot from him. He left an 
impression on everyone here. He 
left an impression on me." 

Jeff Le was also a close friend 
of Kumar's who spoke at the vigil. 

"There's one thing I regret," 
Le said. "I never got to tell him 
that I loved him."

"You kind of let! that since you are innocent, that 
the truth wiU vindicate you," Butcher said. "And I 
asswned that by talking to him, he would realiu: that 
I had nothing to do with it." 

But the poJice and judicial process would not ful-
fill his expectations . 

. At 2 a.m.. on April 6 in 11 now familiar procedure, 
the S.W~ '!- team paid Butcher • second unan-
nounced.VlSlt. '. .• 

Butcher was arrested . for assault with a deadly 
weapon in connection with the syringe atacks in 
Santa Barbara, Calif. 

Butcher ' refused to speak to lead Santa Barbara 
detective Ronald LeGault without his attorney pre': 
sent. Butcher .was hand(;uffed and then taJcen to the 
police statiOn to be boo/aid. 

For the next 15 hom:s. Butcher was put through 
what he described IS an emotionally draining ordeal. 

By pari.sa Baharian, Seni.or 

CNN, Associated Press wires and the Los Angeles 
T171Ulwerc running stories within a day. 

Soon, Butcher~ attorneys presented authorities 
with a list of 16 people who could provide an alibi for 
Butther in San Diego at the time that the two Santa 
Barbara attaclcs occurred. 

It took over a week, but April 18 all charges were 
, finally dropped. Butcher and his family were issued a 
'formal apology. . 

But how could Butcher become the prime suspect 
if hc could not have physically been in the area for 
two of the atacks? 

LeGault, the Santa Barbara detective, defended 
the arrest of Butcher. 

"He was in the right place on the mountain when 
tfie attack occurred," LeGault said. "He is also from 
Santa Barbara. Burcher had the right educational 
baclcground to facilitate - he would know how to do 
jt. And he looks very similar to the description." 

leGault did not say why police did not investigate 
Butcher's whereabouts to determine if he was physi-
cally in Santa Barbara when the attaclcs occurred. 

Mammoth Lalces police never 61ed charges against 
Butcher. 

GorhAm stated there was ceruin evidence thar led 
to Butcher, but in light of the facts that he had alibis 
for the two Santa Barbara cases, Butcher was no 
Jonger a suspect. 

"Our investigation led us·to him, then led away,~ 
Gorham said. "We have no desire to put anyone 
innocent in jail." 

lsychology graduate student Ed Hubbard, 
Butclter\ supervisor in the psychology lab, said police 
never asked him if Butcher was in the lab when the 
last attack occurred in Santa Barbara on April 5. 

If the poJice had checbd, they would have found 
'that Butcher WI$ in the lab with loUr or five people who 
could also wuch for hit p-acoce. 

Hubbard also disputed the authorities' contention 
that Butcher had unique scientific knowledge neces-

",rEEllrH ANIIUAL 

L.CSDUNDERGRADUATE 
RESEARCH CONFERENCE 

WELCOME 
to the Fifteenth Annual UCSD 
Undergraduate Research Conference 

The purpose of UCSD's Annual Research Conference is to recognize the outstanding scholarly work produced by our undergraduates and to stim-
ulate additional interaction between students and faculty at the research level. Another goal is to encourage more undergraduates to pursue doctoral 
degrees and careers in research and college teaching . 

A total of 95 students will be presenting papers at the conference this year. All participants have been nominated by members of the faculty who 
have judged their workJo be outstanding. All students will be awarded a certificate as a research scholar. 

The conference is organized into 17 small roundtable discussions. At each roundtable, five to seven students will present their papers with one or 
more faculty members serving as moderators. Each student has 15 minutes to discuss his or her paper and 5 minutes to answer questions. After 
all presentations are completed, there will be additional time for group discussion. Students will present their papers at either a morning or afternoon 
roundtable. During the session when they are not presenting, students will attend a roundtable 'of their choice as a member of the audience. 

This conference was made possible by generous support from the Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs, Joseph Watson, and the Senior Vice 
Chancellor of Academic Affairs, Marsha Chandler. The annual UCSD Undergraduate Research Conference is planned and coordinated by Academic 
Enrichment Programs which is part of Student Educational Advancement.

12 FEATURES THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Award-winning documentary 
filmmaker comes to UCSD 
'"When Mother Comes Home for Christmas' to be screened 
By LINDSAY BOYD 
Associate Features Editor 

The cri tical gender studies 
department will host a screening of 
the award-winni ng documentary 
""Vhen Mother Comes HOllle for 
C hristmas" May 15 in the Price 
Cen ter Theater. The documentary 
tells the story of a Sri Lankan 
wOlllan who works in Greece to 
support her family in Sri Lanka. 

In addition to viewing the film, 
guests will get to meet the filmmak-
er, 'ilita Vichani. Before he arrives 
Wednesday, let us introduce you to 
the woman behind the movie. 

GUllrdilln: Tell me about your-
sci f. Where did you go to school 
and how did you get into filmmak-
ing? 

Cultural awareness: Nilita Vilchani's 
film addresses issues of immigration, 
feminism and single parenting. 

Nilita Vichani: I grew up in 
India - in Assam, Calcutta and New 
Delhi . I studied literanue in New 
Delhi as an undergraduate and want-
ed to be a journal ist and a wri tel'. 

I came to the United States to 
lattend] the University of 
Pennsylvania as a b'Taduate snldent 
of communications. In my first 
semester I took a documentary 
workshop and we saw these films 
that completely blew me away. "No 
Lies,» "Chronique d'un ete," "Glass" 
... I had never seen films like these. 

I realized that documentaries 
could combine writing and poetry 
with painting in time, and very 
sound sociology. I decided this is 
what I wanted to do. 

Q: How did the idea for "When 
Mother Comes Home For 
Christmas" come about? 

A: I was living in Athens, 
Greece in the early and mid-'90s. 
Athens is not a very multicultural 
city. Being South Asian, I always 
felt like an outsider. 

On weekends, however, r would 
see the city's complexion change 
entirely. The Athenians would dis-
appear to their weekend resorts and 
Athens would become peopled by 
immigrants: Filipinos, Sri Lankans, 
Ethiopians, Pakistanis . 

I tirst became friends with a Sri 
Lankan woman named Maria. My 
natural curiosity got me talking to 
her and before long, she was telling 
me her remarkable story. She had 
been living in Athens for 15 years 
as an illegal migrant and her work 
was to take care of the then-97-
year-old ex-admiral of the Greek 
navy who was confined to his wheel 

chair. With her work in Greece, 
she was supporting 19 children and 
grandchildren in Sri Lanka! 

Through Maria, I discovered an 
entire community of Sri Lankan 
women living in Greece. Tllis led 
me to a ndtural question: If the 
Third World woman is no longer at 
home, what happens to [the home]? 
Who takes care of her children? 

Q: Could you comment on the 
challenges of making films that deal 
with such unsettling issues' 

A: There are many fine docu-
mentary filmmakers who manage 
to make their films without getting 
emotionally involved in their char-
acters'lives. For me, this has always 
been an impossibility. That is the 
only difference I can think of 
between being a socially conscious 
documentary filmmaker versus a 
socially conscious fiction filmmak-
er. 

Q: What is happening now with 
the people who were in the film? 

A: Josephine's dream of buying 
her house and living together with 
her children never came true. 
Instead, she spent the money she 
had saved for the house in getting 
her daughter Norma across to 
Greece. Norma's life is now sound-
ing more and more like her moth-
er's. She has left a 2 -year-old 
behind; for how long we do not 
know. 

Q: What was the most -impor-
tant thing you took away from 
making the film? 

A: What I've learned from every 
film I've made: No matter how 
much I research, I will never know 
what I will find. 

Cleared: 
Butcher decries media 
coverage of arrest 
Continued from pale 9 
sary to commit the crime because 
he has worked in a lab at UCSD 
for three years and has a minor in 
biology. 

"Any student who has taken a 
few biology and chemistry classes 
would know how to do it," 
Hubbard said, referring to mak-
ing the tranquilizer mixture that 
was in the syringes. "Our lab is a 
psychology lab - we don't have 
chemicals. The hardest drug we 
have is Advil." 

Hubbard believes that the 
police made up their minds that 
Butcher was the suspect and did-
n't bother to investigate further. 

'''I've made up my mind, don't 
confuse me with the facts,' is the 
feeling that I got about the police 
investigation," Hubbard said. 

At no point, Hubbard said, did 
he ever think Butcher could have 
committed the crime he was 
accused of. 

Butcher takes issue with the 
way the media, especially the 
G1IIIrdilln, handled the situation 
when news of his arrest became 
public. 

"1 really think that the 
G1Iardian acted incredibly irre-
sponsibly in this situation, espe-
cially with printing my picture," 
Butcher said. "It was like, 'Watch 
out for this guy! '" 

Mter Butcher's photograph 
was published, he said he began 
getting strange looks on campus . 
Butcher said that in one of his 
classes, a girl had just read the 
article, and when she got to 
Butcher's picture, she looked at 
him, then back at the picture 
turning herself sideways away 
from Butcher, as if, he said, to

ward off a potential attack. 
"'Nl'tat really bothers me is the 

thought that there are all these 
random people, sa)' John Doe who 
lives in Florida and reads the paper 
and just sees Peter Butcher arrest-
ed for this crime, and he never 
hears anything about it again." 
Butcher said. "It's a disturbing 
thought to think that there are 
these people out there thinking 
those thoughts about me." 

Butcher isn't bitter about 
what happened . He vitws him-
self as fortunate to have had the 
resources to prove his inno-
cence. Though the authorities 
and public viewed him as sus-
pect, Butcher had the unwaver-
ing support of his family and 
friends , who stood by him 
through it all. 

Butcher's mother, Carolyn 
Butcher, believes that there are 
many who are not as fornmatc to 
have the financial resources to 
hire the best attorneys. 

"How many young men are 
out there sitting in jails because 
they don't have financial means 
to prove their innocence?" she 
said. "How many more Peter 
Butchers are out there?"

PLAYOFF UPDATE 
Golf finishes 7th at Regionals 
Gale, Duckworth hoping for NCAA finals bids 
By ANU' KUMAR 
Associate Sports Editor 

The UCSD men 's golf team is 
a pan of one of the toughest 
regions in the nation, playing with 
three of the country\; top five 
Division II golf teams. The 
Tritons knew they would need a 
strong showing 'at the NCAA 
Division D Men~ West Regional 
to advance to the nationals. 

A slow start in the three-day 
tournament, which ended May 8, 
relegated UCSD to seventh place 
in Goodyear, Ariz., where UC 
Davis led the field of eight teams 
and took home the champi-
onship. 

The Tritons fell behind early 
in the first round . The lowest of 
the five scores posted by UCSD 
was an even-par 72 by Brian 
Duckworth, and the Tritons had 
a team total 304. This len them 
20 strokes behind the leader, in 
eighth place, and fort.:ed to claw 
their way up the standings to 
make a rcspectable finish . 

In the second round, the 
Tritons shot 302 and moved up 
to seventh place. On the second 
clay of the tournament, UCSD 
didn 't have anyone shoot par or 
better, and Duckworth again led 
the team, this time with a 73.

importance of a balanced, healthy 
diet, while demonstrating a human-
itarian concern \vith the overpopu-
lation of the earth. 

On the opposite sex (said to a 
female reporter asking a question): 
"I normally don't do interviews with 
women unless I fornicate with them. 
So you shouldn't talk anymore ... 
Unless you want to, you know." 

Spin: I'm very shy in nont of 
the ladies, especially in front of so 
many people. However, if you'd 
prefer to do a private interview 
over a candle-lit dinner, I would 
feel more comfortable. 

On tender emotions: "I wish that 
you guys had children so I could 
kick them in the [expletivel head or 
stomp on their testicles so you could 
feel my pain, because that's the pain 
I have waking up every day."

tenuous; I wish I could find the 
right words to describe to you the 
true depth of my sorrow.

life. Can I at least get laid? I mean,

The Tritons broke 300 in the 
final round, closing the tourna-
ment with a score of 292. 
Despite finishing well, UCSD 
hoped to be more successful. 

"We were disappointed. We 
didn't compete with the top guys 
like we wanted," Duckworth 
said. "Those teams with more 
experience go off to a good start. 
We did well in the last round, 
but we got off to a bad start." 

Davis shot scores of 284, 289 
and 283 to earn a total of856, and 
it finished 42 strokes better than 
UCSD. Cal State Stanislaus, 
which took second place, ended 
nine StroKes behind Davis with a 
combined score of 865. Rounding 
au{ the top five teams were Cal 
State Bakersfield , Western 
Washington University and 
Chico State. 

Individually, Mark Lawless of 
Stanislaus shot scores of 70, 69 
and 72 . He was five lmder par in 
his three rounds and led dIe tour-
nament by two strokes. Davis' 
Jason Boyd finished in second 
with scores of 69, 73 and 71, and 
both Josh Immordino of Western 
Washington and Jay Westerlund 
of Davis finished a stroke behind 
Boyd to tie for third place. Grand 
Canyon's Tommy Medina and 
Davis' Scott Gordon tied lvith

ing only one more game to win. 
Jansen lost onlv one match this 
season, finishin g with an impres-
sive 25-1 singles record. 

Westerman swept her first set 
6-0, bllt was down 2-5 in the sec-
ond before suspension. She fin-
ished the season undefeated with 
26 victories .

cate otherwise, the Tritons' abili-
ty to keep the match close against 

money; can I at least get [oral sex) 
\vithout people wanting to harass me 
and wanting to throw me in jail?" 

Spin: I enjoy upholding tradi-
tional American values, yet it 's 
been a while since I've practiced a 
few of them. 

On responsibility: "I'm the 
most irresponsible person in the 
world. The reason I'm like that is 
because at 21 you all gave me $50 
or $100 million , and I didn't know 
what to do. I'm from the ghetto. I 
don't know how to act. One day 
I'm in a dopehouse robbing some-

child. I'm being abused ... And you 
tell me I should be responsible?" 

Spin: My background is differ-

scores of 215 to complete the top 
five positions. 

Duckworth's score of 219 led 
the Tritons, and he finished the 
tournament tied for 14th wi th 
Jamie Kum of Western 
Washington and Eric Restrepo of 
Davis. Alan Scheer had scores of 
73,75 and 73 to place him in a tie 
for 18th with Kevin Klebe of Cal 
State Bakersfield, Western New 
Mexico's Anders Magnusson and 
Todd Halpen. Tritons Ryan Gale, 
Greg Wilson and Eugene Itkin 
finished in 32nd, 43rd and 44th, 
respectively. 

The top individual finisher at 
the regionals from a team that 
did not qualify for the NCAA 
Division II Championships 
earned an autolnatic bid to the 
nationals. Chico State's J.] . 
J akovac, who finished just one 
stroke ahead of Duckworth, 
earned the trip to the next stage. 

UCSD head coach Mike 
Wydra and his team hope that 
Duckworth and Gale, who have 
been solid throughout the season, 
will earn an at-large bid from the 
NCAA selection committee. The 
NCAA Division n 
Championships will take place 
May 21 through May 24 at the 
Mission Inn Resort in Orlando, 
Fla. 

!I much stronger Barry squad 
bodes well for the future of a 
team that usually pl ayed one 
senior, four sophomores and a 
freshman. 

Next season, UCSD will look 
to continue its 16-year streak of 
NCAA tournament appearances, 
but without the services of 
Tadlock, who will graduate with 
one second-place and two fifth-
place finishes in her NCAA tour-
na men t career. 

On respect for opposition: "On 
June 8, flesh will not be enough. I 
will take Lennox's title, his soul 
and smear his pompous brains all 
over the ring when I hit him." 

Spin: [ am highly anticipating 
my upcoming bout with my 
respected opponent Lennox Lewis. 
I am grateful for the opportunity 
to win the world title, and while I 
realize he is an opponent of high 
caliber, I am confident in my 
chances to earn the victory. 

On hobbies : "I can sell out 
Madison Square Garden mastur-
bating." 

Spin: I believe people are drawn 
to me for my dynamic personality, 
and my inherent radiant beauty. The 
excellence of my character is simply 
magnetic, and I think the number of 
my funs and friends is quite sizable. 

On religion: "Everybody COIll\-
teraets what God is really about. If 
Jesus was here, do you think Jesus 
would show me any love? Do you 
think Jesus would love me? I'm a 
Muslim, but do you think Jesus 
would love me ... I thinkJesus would 
have a drink with me and discuss .. . 
Now, he would be cool. He would 
talk to me. But [Christians) don't 
understand that when he comes 
back, that these crazy greedy capital-
istic men are gonna kill him again." 

Spin: While being a devout 
Muslim myself, I am tolerant to aU 
religions. I particularly have many 
Christian friends and enjoy dis-
cussing theology with them. 

With golden quotes such as 
these, it's hard to believe Tyson's 
PR firm decided to give him the 
boot. Well Tyson, if you still need 
another public relations person, 
give me call. Just s~y away from 
my ears.

UCSD grabs second, fifth in CCAA championships 
Twelve Tritons earn all-CCAA honors, teams prepare for Div. II finafs 
By KEITH DO 
Staff Writer 

VCSD 's track and field team 
ended its regular season with what 
hC:ld coach Tony Salerno called the 
t CJll1 'S best meet of the season at 
th C.lliforl1l <l Collegiate Athletic 
ASSOCIation Championships this 
weekend at UCSD 's TritOn Track 
JIllI Field Stadium. 

T be ho t TritOns took second in 
the women's competition and fifth 
on the men's side, improving on 

last yea r 's fourth-place women's 
finish and maintaining last yea r's 
fifth-place men's standing. 

The women's team fini shed 
with 104 points, but its tOtal was 
well behind UC Davis, which had 
220 points en route to its fourth 
consecutive women' CCAA title. 
Chico State tOok third with 99 
poi nts, foll owed by Cal State 
Stanislaus with 92 points in the 10-
team field . 

"We knew we would be in a 
position to do well," Salerno said. 

Isaac Sullivan/Guardian 

Good form: UCSO's Audrey Sung (left) leads several opponents. Sung set 
personal records in both the 1,500- and 3,OOo-meter runs last weekend. 

"We got all of the breaks, and 
everyone competed really well. We 
thought it would be really close for 
second place, but we just had a phe-
nomenal meet across the board . In 
a lot of ways, it wasn't about the 
people who finished first, second or 
third - it's the sixth, seventh and 
eighth place ones that got us one or 
two points, and that was what made 
a difference." 

Meredith Perry stunned the 
100-meter high hurdles field with a 
first-place fini sh over defending 
champion Melissa Ferguson of UC 
Davis and runner-up Michelle 
Green of Cal State Dominguez 
Hill with a time of 14.69 - the 
second -fastest in school history, but 
just short of the 14.65 required for 
a National Collegiate Ath letic 
Association provisional qualifica-
tion to the Division II national 
championships. 

Though Perry's title stands 
alone for the women, the other 
Tritons did not walk away without 
accolades of their own, setting 
numerous school records and top-
10 marks during the two-day event. 

Megan Bergin, already an 
NCAA provisional qualifi)!r in the 
hammer throw, set a UCSD record 
with a mark of 166'1" to surpass 
the 164'9" set by Tara Monaghan 
in 1996. The 400-meter relay team 
of Elizabeth T~u, Aileen Sabio, 
Alison McGrane and Hillary Mills 
also set a school record with a time 
of 3:54.47, beating out the 1996 
relay team's mark of 3 :55.74. 

Colin Young-Wolff/Gualdion 
Extension: UCSO's Julie Pope, #33, was one of the multiple UCSD athletes 
who placed in the school's record books over the weekend. 

Audrey Sung set personal 
records in the 1,500- and 3,000-
meters, both of which she has 
already earned NCAA provisional 
qualifications for. Sung's 10:01 .41 
in the 3,000 meter earned her a 
second-place finish and her 4:38.99 
in the 1,500 garnered a third-place 

standing. The 2001 All-American 
Sung in the 3,000 meters also fin-
ished fifth in the 5,000 meters, the 
third event in which she has a pro-
visional bid.

Women's tennis loses in quarterfinals 
Tritons beat Northwood, lose to familiar foe Barry 5-1 

stoner 
steps 

By COREY HOLMAN 
Staff Writer 

The UCS D women's tennis 
team advanced to the quarterfinals 
of the ational Collegiate Athletic 
Association Women's Tennis 
Championships before falling to 
Barry U niversity 5- 1 on Friday 
afternoon . 

The Tritons adva nced to the 
tournan,ent after a 22-3 regular 
season in which they took home 
the California Collegiate Athletic 
Association regular-season title. 

UCSD opened the competition 
with a 5-2 victory against 

orthwood University of 
Michigan in the first round of the 
16-team championship. 

The Tritons opened the match 
by winning two of the three dou-
bles contests. Lyndsey Tadlock 
and Julie Westerman clawed out 
a 9-7 victory in No. I doubles 
action, while Ashley O 'Neil and 
Mary Hung were able to pull 
down an 8-5 victory at No.2 . 
Kristina Jansen and Jasmin Dao 
dropped their No. 3 match at 3-
8. 

Goi ng into singles, the 
Tritons needed to pick up three 
victories, and they accomplished 
that with ease. Westerman con-
tinued her umJefeated singies 
season with a 6-1, 7-5 victory at 
No. 6. Jansen picked up the vic-
tory at o. 5 (6-1, 7-5) and 
O'Neil ra n away with a 6-2 ,6-3 

victory at No. 2 to give UCSD 
the victory. Jasmin Dao fell at 
No.1 (6-0, 6-0) to push the final 
score to 5-2 . The other two 
matches were left unfinished, but 
Tadlock was only two games from 
taking her singles match, and 
Hung was down a set and even 3-
3 in the second. 

With the victory, the Tritons 
advanced to the quarterfinals to 
take on Barry University, which 
defeated Bloomsburg College of 
Pennsylvania 5-0 in the first 
round. UCSD faced Barry earlier 
in the year, ending up on the 
wrong end of a 6-3 semifinal in 
the Xenia Anastasiadou 
Tournament on April 6. 

Barry entered the tournament 
as the third seed, but the unseed-
cd Tritons were able to give the 
favorite a scare. 

Earlier in the season, Barry 
rode three doubles wins to the 
easy team victory, but UCSD 
nearly reversed those fortunes in 
their second meeting. 

O'Neil and Hung were able to 
knock off Gizella Turbok and 
Bojana Miladinovic, the No. 22 
doubles team in the nation, 8-6. 
Jansen and Dao nearly took their 
match against Ewa Kleczek and 
Valeria Papandrea, losing a 
tiebreaker 7-5 after finishing the 
match 8-8. Tadlock and 
Westerman were overpowered at 
No. I doubles against the sixth-
ranked doubles tandem of Victoria 

Courmes and Maria Lopez. 
Down 2-1 , the Tritons knew 

they had to win four of the sin-
gles matches, one of which must 
be over one of Barry's three 
nationally ranked players. In the 
end, Barry's strength on the top 
of its lineup was too much for 
UCSD. 

No. 5 Courmcs knocked off 
Dao (3-6, 1-6) at No. I singles. 
Dao fini shed the season with an 8-
17 record in her first collegiate 
season, though her play dramati-
cally improved over the year. 

The nation's 17th-ranked 

Turbock had few problems with 
O'Neil, picking up the win 3-6, 1-
6 at No.2 singles. O'Neil finished 
her singles season with a 15- 10 
record . 

Tadlock also dropped her 
match against 44th-ranked Lopez 
4-6, 1-6, but the loss did little to 
diminish the lone senior's record 
of \9-5 . 

With victory assured, the other 
three matches were suspended, 
though the UCSD players had 
great chances to win all three.

So dose: The women's tennis team finished the 2002 season with a 23-4 
record and a game shy of advancing to the national championship match.

uniforms after games? 

These are all tough jobs; anyone 
would agree. But they pale in COI11-
parison to the huge obstacles, the 
seemingly insurmountable work, the 
pitfall after pitfall that Mike Tyson's 
public relations firm has to deal with. 

The firm just dropped Tyson 
after a particularly expletive-ridden, 
offensive interview less than a 
month before his June 8 world title 
bout against Lennox Lewis. 

I don't see why - there are some 
great opportunities to spin certain 
Tyson quotes into great sound bites 
for public consumption. I mean, this 
guy covers a lot of important issues 
present in our society today. 

First off, the whole biting inci-

Tyson's "I want to kill people. I want
