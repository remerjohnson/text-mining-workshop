PARADISE LOST?

Fernalde: Warren sophomore Curtis Jenson admires the overhang, constructed of wood 
and palm fronds, he and his roommates built on their apartment balcony. 

University Orders Removal of Warren 
Balcony Covering, then Reverses Decision 
PALAPA: Mark Smith and his 
roommates obtained pennission 
before building structure 
By Erin Patrick 
Guardian Reporter 

Amidsl the grey, concrete-block architecture 
of the Warren Apartments, onc Douglas Hall 
balcony stands out as a tropical paradise. 

According to Warren sophomore Mark Smith, 
Warren Ass istant Rcsident Dean Eric Rollcrson 
requested that he di smanlle hi s "palapa" - a 
wooden frame with 'a palm leaf overhang - in a 
Jan. 16 leiter. -

According to Rollerson, thc patio covering 
was in violation of university policy. 

However, Rollerson did not speci fy which 
policy had been violated. Smith was advised to 
"review you r studcnt handbook to be sure you 
understand this policy and others in their en-
tircty." 

Guidcline 12 of the Warren Stlldent Handbook 
states that "construction inside or on balconies 
involving heavy building matenab ... is strictly 
prohibitcd," 

However, Smith clai med thatthc wooden frame 

weighs no more than two peoplc, and that he 
obtained Rollerson 's permission to assemble the 
palapa al the beginning of fall quarter. 

Rollerson said he was uncertain how the palapa 
actually violatcd university policy. He had at-
tached to thc leiter a copy of a Jan. 8 memo from 
Housing Maintenance Supervisor AI Alarcon, 
asking "whcn wi lithe student be taking this down'!" 

Although Smith had been instructcd to disas-
semble thc palapa by today, Housing Superinten-
dent John Contrcras told him on January 21 -
fi vc days after Rollerson's leltcr - that the patio 
covering did not violate University policy and 
could remain on the balcony. 

Howcver. ca mpus Fire Marshall Ri chard 
Benton said he was surpri sed Contreras had al-
lowed Ihe palapa to remain. 

'Thescbuildings arc of what is described in thc 
building code as nonflammable construction," hc 
said. "It was inappropriate for any wooden struc-
tures to be cstahlished ... ( would perccive that as 
being contrary to the intcnt of the building code." 

Alarcon had no comment , and Contreras cou ld 
not he reached by prc~s ti me. 

Smi th said he harborcd no resentment toward 
Roll cr~on , who he said was most likely under 
pressure from hi s supcrior~.

MONEY: Official says 
pledges normally take 8- 18 
months to be collected 
By Nandini Harihareswara 
Guardian Reporter 

A I O,()()O gi It fro m the lass of 1995 to 
the Office for Studenls with Oisahilities 
(050), which Illany Ihought was missing in 

. action, mysteriously hecame availableTues-
day afternoon. 

According to OSD Director Roberta 
Gimblell , someone from Ihe'annual-giving 
section of the campus-development office 
left a voice-mail message for hcr staff at 
4:05 p.m., with the news that the money was 
avai lable. 

While Gimblett said she was glad to have 
the money, she was also mystified by the 
development office's timing. She said she 
had becn told as recently as November that 
the money would not be available for sev-
era l years. 

"What I have conditionally been told is 
Ihat thc money was not available because of 
the way it was pledged: that it would not be 
realizcd for live years," she said. 

UCSD Associatcd Students Issues Coor-
dinator Phil Hernandez said Assistant Di-
reclorofAnnual Giving A. J. Kohn told him 
the gift would not be ready for disbursement 
for sevcral years. However, Kohn said yes-
terday thai between eighl and 18 months 
usually pass before gift recipients see any 
money. 

Gimblett said shc had "no clue" why the 
money suddenly became available. 

"Whcn I talked to Ihem Ihey were very 
surpri scd because· thcy weren ' t expecting 
the money to be rcady for a while ," 
Hernandcz said. 

Howcver, current Annual Giving Direc-
lor Susan Shiomi-Cobas said she was un-
sure whether the money was actually avail -
able because the UCSD Foundation controls 
di sburscments. 

'Theoretica lly , Ihis money was supposed 
10 ha ve been transferred to Disabled Student 
Services," Shiomi-Cobas said. 'They might 
already have I don' t know i fit has occurred 
or nOL"

past Tuesday on topics rangi ng rrom 
admission policies to funding for 
UCSD's Office for Students with 
Disab ilit ies. 

A .S. President Coleen Sabatini 
questioned Watson and Richard 
Bat:ker - the assistant vice chan-
cellor or enrollment managementJ 
registrar - on why the university 
will not accept incoming students 
with a projected first -year grade 
point average below a 2.5. 

" I think [this policYI is limiting 
the admittance or certain et hnic 
groups. mainly Chicanos. Latinos 
and African Amcrit:ans." Sabatini 
s .. id. "The 2.5 is j udgmental and 
arhitrary. A 2.0 GPA is the state 
limit. su I don 't understand why 
UCSD relics on thi s hell curve equa-
tion for student udmiuance." 

However. W atson said out of 
11 ,000 upplicants turned away each 
year. 90 percent are UC-eligihleand 
derended the vulidity of the formu la 
for selecting potential students. 

·'Thus. it depends on the quality 
of admits Ito UCSD I." W,ttson said. 
" We do not re(;~nize a Jlaw in our 

equation; it works best with a large 
number of students." 

Backer added. " We are the only 
ones who usc (this equationJ . In thi s 
very-competitive environment. we 
know students are going to st ruggle 

professor's lecture verhatim onto a 
screen the student can see. 

Acwrding-to Witztum, deaf stu· 
dents have only two or three real·time 
captioners to work with during their 
lectures and the captioocrs are not 

and that is why 
we use thisequa-
tion for admit -

Watson fur-
t her added that 
disregarding the 
grade-point stan-
dard in dcfercm;e

Sabatini sug-

ally a disservit:e.

Sense with New Fee Policy 

Congratulations to the U Office of the President 
(UCOP ) for introducing a plan to "cut" student fee s and 
offer long-term structure so families can prepare for how 
they're going to pay for their children 's C education . 

The new long- te rm fee policy reduces the prev ious 10-
percent annual hikes in tuition down to a projected aver-
age rate of inc rease of 4.5 percent per annum. 

In addition 10 the tuition cut, the proposed long-term 
fee policy also promises fillnilies some reliahle, pre-
dictable numbers around which 10 base the financin g of 
their sons' and daughters ' educations. In the pa~t , fees 
were raised in a helter-skelter fashion, goi ng up apprecia-
bly during times of economic duress (when middle-c la~s 
parent~ whose children did not qualify for financial aid 
cou ld least afford it) and going up only minutely or not 
ilt all during economic-boom years . Thi s new poli cy 
would give parents more stabi lity, with mode rate fee 
increases every year. Parents can plan for these steady 
and s ubtl e increases, adjusting their budgets and s truc tur-
ing their financial planning to accommodate for a known 
factor. 

Additionally, actual inc reases in tuition under th e new 
plan would be linked directly to growth in per~onal 
income. which further ensures that parents won ' t be hit 
with hugt.: tuition int.:reases during times of economic 
hardship. 

This new plan is a good first step toward making the 
UC accessible to all qualified students. To additionally 
decrease volarililY, we urge Ihe regents to adopt the pro-
posed use of the five -year average of personal income 
growth. giving both the UC and parents greater stabi lity 
in planning for revenue flow. 

Bravin Should Not Be 
Excluded troIII CoI11IIlittee 

Each year the UC Regents are charged with appointing 
one UC student to a one-year term on the Board of 
Regents. The 26-member board selects a small group that 
makes a recommendation to the full board on who should 
be voted in as student regent. Notably absent from this 
year's comminee is current student regenr Jess Bravin . 

Why wasn't Bravin chosen to be on the selection com-
millce? The best explanation is the one that Bravin himself 
gives: Some regents - Roy Brophy in particular - object 
to Bravin's somewhat outspoken opposition to actions the 
board has taken, including the board's student-fee policy 
(or lack thereon and the legality of proceedings at a recent 
closed session of the board . 

Regent Brophy 's responses to Bravin's activities have 
been harshly personal : "We've had some great student 
regents. The last two have been exceptions." Quick to 
cover his vengeful tracks, Brophy asserted that Bravin 
wasn't excluded from the selection committee because of 
his outspoken participation . Rather, "the student regent ". 
is not automatically a member of the committee." 

On the contrary, only once before has a student regent 
been left off the selection committee. It is not true that the 
student regent has, as Brophy says, "occasionally" been 
included on the committee. The student regent has been 
there because he is in one of the best positions to judge the 
qualifications of student-regent applicants . 

The regents - Roy Brophy especially - have no right 
to get back at Regent Bravin for his vocal opposition by 
excluding him from a vital committee. Bravin has shown 
great dedication as student regent. Although some regents 
may not agree with Regent Bravin, they should stop trying 
to exact revenge and start acting like grown-ups.

was preparing 
to write this 

column, the lyrics of John 
Lennon's "Imagine" came to mind, 
and a wave of nausea swepl over 
me. 

It wasn 't because I find visions 
of social utopia irresponsibly opti-

Lelmon's lyrics. 10 horrow a phrase 
from F. SCOtl Fitlgerald. do in fact 
stand "for everylhi ng for which I 
have unatfcctcd scorn." 

It 's just thai Lennon's ideal 
world - a world without private 
property, religion or war: a world 
where somehow everyone lives 
together in harmony - is actually 
a dystopia, the very opposite of a 
ulopia. Such a world would be the 
very epi tome of poverty, oppres-
sion and hopelessness . People 
would not he allowed 10 provide 
for their own material needs in Ihe 
way they saw til. nor would they he 
allowed to enjoy Ihe fruits of their 
labor. Family and community ties 
made strong through religious 
commitment would be non-exis-
tent , thus rending society apart . 
Life in Lennon's world would be. 

Murray's vision Is 
bold and rooted in 
the American 
tradition of 
freedom. Yes, 
freedom - not 
collectivism - Is 
the American 
tradition. The 
bloated government 
we He today would 
have been 
unthinkable for the 
first 150 or so years 
of this cO.uatry's 
existence. 

If the hislory of rhe 20th ce ntu -
ry has proved anything il is thai 
leftist programs - and bi g govern-
ment in general - that sacrifice 
individual liherty for the sake of 
some elusive "common good" have 
heen ahject failures . These fai lures 
are by no means limited to regimes 
other than our own. 

For proof. one need look no fur-
fher than a heautifully written book 
by Charles Murray called "What It 
Means To Be A Libertarian." In 
crysta l clear prose, Murray lays out 
two maj or themes: how govern-
ment solutions to social problems 
violate individual liberty, and how 
mosl if not all federal programs 
implemented within the last 60 
years have utterly fai led to reach 
their lofty goals and have actually 
contributed to human misery. 

Thc lir~ t theme is laid oul in the 
fi rst few pages of the book . 
"Freedom is our hirthright. [The] 
ordinary person owes many things 
to many people and institutions -
to family, friends, community, 
church, workplace. But an ohliga-
tion 10 the government is unique . 
When the government decides you 
owe it somelhing, that obligalion is 
encoded in law. If you break a law, 
a representative of the government

demands. The right to initiate the use of physical force ,

COMMENTARY: Madeline Albright'S nomination as the first female secratary of state marks the first astute move 
by Clinton's second administration; here's why the apointment is good for women and U.S, foreign policy 

ALBRIGHT: A BOON FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS 
By Jul" Ku .......... 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

ow that the election is over, 
we can all slide baek inlo our usual 
hahit of assuming that the world is 
out to get us and that politicians 
are more interested in raising 
money than doing anYlhing that 
might help government work. 
Right '! 

Well. no. The nomination of 
Madelci ne Albright for secretary 
of slate demonstrates thatlhe nom-
inalion pro4:ess is working as well 
as Michael Jordan 's jump shot. 

Like a shot by Michael Jordan, 
chances are high thai Albright's 
nomination will go Ihrough . 
Furthermore, the Republican 
defense is left with its hands in the 
air. Instead of trying to stop the 
nomination, they stand in place, 
permanently dazzled by ils artistry. 

Albrighl 's nomination is spec-
tacular in many ways . 

First of all, President Clinton 
has fultilled his promise 10 female 
voters who helped re-eIC4:1 him. ]n 
the 1996 election, according to 
Voler News Service, Clinton 
received 54 percent of the female 
vote. Comparatively, men were 
equally split between Clinlon and 
Dole. 

In order to maintain the support 
of women being more loyal to the 
Democratic party than men , 
Clinton had to do somelhing to 
make women proud. Albright's 

nomination accomplishes thi s 
goal. allowing Clinton to appoint a 
hard-line choice for sec relary of 
siale withoul causing a feminist 
back tash. Furthermore , Clinton 
now has Ihe salis faction of know-
ing that his "mama's smiling 
down" at him for appointing a 
woman. 

Secondly, by appointing 
Albright. Clinton has helped Vice 
President Gore's chance of being 
elected president in 2000. The 
other possible secretary of state 
nominees, Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) 
and former Senate Majority 
Leader George Mitchell, are both 
considered more powerful in 
Washington and international cir-
cles than Albright. A successful 
term as secrelary of state might 
have set either one up for a run at 
the White House in 2000. Since 
Albright cannot run for president 
in 2000 (she was not born in the 
U.S.), her nomination does not 
challenge Gore's presidential 
hopes in any way. 

Funhermore, Albright is per-
sonable. As UN ambassador, she 
quickly emerged as the most ener-
getic and articulate member of the 
president's foreign-policy team. 
While Secretary of State Warren 
Chrislopher and National Security 
Advisor Anthony Lake lulled tele-
vision audiences to sleep, Albright 
never fai led to surprise broadcast-
ers and audiences with bold state-

Albright waa, and la, 
creatln, a precedent 
for how women In 
power should act. 
She Is maldng sure

menls. For example, after two 
unarmed privale ain:raft were shot 
down for venturing near Cuba, 
Albright remarked, "Fr.mkly. this 
is not cojones. this is cowardice." 

Albrighl has also proven thai 
she can handle the role of being 
one of the few women in the top 
levels of government. As the only 
woman on Ihe UN' Security 
Counci I these past four years, 
Albright was conscious of her sta-

tus as one of the only female 
amhassadors, yet never overem-
ph;tsized it. 

Similarly, we can expec t her to 
treat the role of being the fi rst 
lem;tle scnelary of state with the 
~ame humor anu grace. At her 
nomination ceremony. she said to 
Secrelary or State Chrislopher, "I 
can only hope that my heels can 
fill your shoes." 

Although Alhright is tough. she 
never appears to hide her feminin-
ity in an allempt to gain political 
leverage. For instance, when tak-
ing her tum as President of Ihe UN 
Security Counci I on Feh. 14 , 
Albrighl surprised fellow ambas-
sadors by placi ng red bags of 
cundy and cookies in front of 
them. She then explained to them 
rhat on Valenrine 's Day ir was a 
treat to be lhe only woman among 
14 handsome and intelligent men. 

Albrighl was, and is. creating a 
preceden't\ for how women in 
power should act. She is making 
sure that future female polilicians 
will not have 10 act like men in 
order to be taken seriously. 

Clinton's nomination is also 
dazzling bt:cause Albrighl has a 
wide base of support . She will be 
able to work with the conservative 
Repuhlican majority in the Senate. 
Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), the liv-
ing symbol of conservative 
RepUblicanism, and Albright 
already get along, having worked 

together through the Senate 
Foreign Relalions Commillee. 
Sen. Helms applauded her nomi-
nation for secretary of state . 
Likewise, Albright has ca lled 
Hl!lms "a living legend and one of 
the true genllemcn 01 the U.S. 
Senale ," 

The Alhright nomination is 
mosl impressive because it repre-
senls a shift in Ihe way President 
Clinton treats foreign policy. In 
1994. National Security Advisor 
Anthony Lake. now the nominee 
to head the CIA, said that the pur-
pose of foreign policy was 10 hring 
about the "enhancement of democ-
racy." 

At Ihe same time, so-called 
"realisls" argued that the real pur-
pose of foreign policy is to 
enhance the national interest. The 
"realists" argued Ihat foreign poli-
cy should emphasize giving priori-
ty to business, economic and secu-
rily relatiom,hips_ 

Throughoul his first term, 
Clinton went out of his way to 
prove the realists' ,claims . 
However. he seems to have recent-
ly changed his slance. For exam-
ple, it is impossible to argue that 
the purpose in sending troops to 
the former Yugoslavia was to 
enhance the national interest. 
Instead. the troops are in 
Yugoslavia because of what 
Albright calls America's "core val-

extremely fond of understating 
government 's power. In 1993, 
when he asked Congress to raise 
taxes to pay for his budget , Clinton 
daimed that his plan "asks" the 
wealthiest Americans pay their fair 
share. Ahem, government doesn' t 
"a~k" anyone to do anything; gov-
ernment demands. The United 
Negro College Fund asks you for

Murray points out , hcfore govern-

ti vely and compassionately looked 
afler the poor and less fortunate 
members of society. Thousands of 
independent charit ahle organi za-
tions - many of them religiously 
based - dedicated themselves to 
alleviating human suffering. These 
charities differed from govemment 
handouts in that they demanded 
responsibility from those who 
received aid. The indigent were 
en(;ouraged to seek work, and sin-
gle mothers weren ' t encouraged to 
try to rai se their children on their

take active roles in gell ing their

by poor women. the illegitimacy 
rate has skyrockcted. approaching

black Americans. 

But it is not just welfare thai has 
failed spectacularly. Murray notes 
that Medil:are has had no signili-

Social Se(;u rity, as we all know,

Although a few points in the

see today would have been 
unthinkable for Ihe first 150 or so 
years of this w untry's existence. In 

. fact, Murray envisions a federal 
government that spends roughl y 
two-fifths (~660 billion) of what it 
now does ($1 .6 tri Ilion), and whose 
law books are lrimmed to a very. 
very small fraction of their current 
size. 

Bill Clinlon would have us 
believe that "the era of big govern-
ment is over." [ disagree. 
Government is still the problem -
not the solution; it still regulates 
and spends too much. But the tide 
is turning. People are beginning to 
re(;ognize how oppressively inefli -
cient government is and always 
will be. "What It Means To Be A 
Libertarian" is merely the tirst shot 
in a revolution that will culminate 
not in utopia, but in a free society 
where human happiness is free to 
be pursued wilhoutthe oversight of 
Big Brother - or Big Bubba. 

one is perfect, and Madeleine 
Albright is no exception. As a 
result of her strong support of 
internationally unpopu lar posi -
tion~ taken hy the U.S .. Alhright 
alienated some of her UN peers. It 
is irol11c that the tenaci ty that 
secu red her nomination fo r secre-

the only thing that prevents her 
from becoming one of the greate~t

British and

clash in new 
comedy,film by 

producer 
John Cleese, 

(7lierce Creatures. JJ 

A:ter the runaway success of the second most successful . British fi 1m of all time, "A Fish Called Wanda," jt is 
surprising that a sequel , or an "equal" as co-
star John Cleese corrects us, did not come 
out earlier. Created and performed by an 
almost identical [1st and crew, "Fierce Crea-
tures" attempts to recreate the mood estab-
lished in the original. 

While portraying characters unrelated to 
those in "Wanda," there can be no doubt as to 
the inspiralion of thi s film. Although pos-
sessing several scenes that are .quite humor-
ous, "Fierce Creatures" is, for the mOst part, 
fails to li ve up to its illustrous predecessor. 

"Fierce Creatures" takes place in a British 
zoo that has just come under the control of 
multibillionare business tycoon Rod 
McCain (Kevin Kline ), who threatens lo 
close it down if it does not quickly tum out 
a profit of 20-percent on his inveslment. To 
faci litate this end, career minded executive 
Willa Weston (Jamie Lee Curlis), and the 
billionaire 's ludicrous son , Vince McCain 
(also Kevin KI ine) , lake off to England in 
order to increase profits . 

Their arrival brings them into conlact 
with the new, though aging. direclor of the 
park , Rollo Lee, played by John Cleese - a 
man very worried about hi s future emplQY-
ment. In order to attract higher numbers of 

visitor.~, Rollo has decided 10 replace all the 
existing exhibits with the most violent, dan-
gerous animals he can find . 

As the story progresses Rollo and Willa 
realize how wonderful the park is, and are 

. forced to re-evaluate their jobs, while Vince 
runs around finding ways to exploit both the 
zoo and its animals to maximize profits . 
This results in a pitched baltle detennining 
the outcome of the park .

IT'S 
ELEMENTARY 
Addressing gay issues 
in elementary schools 

By Jam/ Lofgreen 
Staff Writer 

Most elementary school chil-
dren have some knowledge of the 
slur "faggot," whether overheard 
as a ha llway insult or 
ushered from the moulhs 
of TV talk show guests. 

Dehra Chasnoff's 
documentary, "It 's Ele-
mentary," laps inlo kids ' 
awareness of ant i-gay 
sen timents by capluri ng 
classroom discussions in 
seyeral U.S . schools. The 
fi lm addresses whether or nOl, 
and if so how, Ihese gay-re lated 
issues shou ld he discussed wilhin 
the classroom conlext. 

School discuss ion of gay com-
rnu nilies and discrim ination is per-
haps one of today's most contro-
yersia l issues. The preya iling polit-
ica l climate censors classroom dia-
logue about gay issues, a lopic Ihal 
can polarize communi lies. 

In the !i lm, educator., kept in 
mind p:lrel1l~ , apprehension . Many 
ad ulls sha;ed fears Ihat di scussions 
of gay is~ ues would promolc 
"recruIlm.:nt"' to Ihe gay lifc~t y le 
or involye the dl~cuss i () n of sex .

Instead, dialogues focused on 
biases and di sc rimination of gays 
and lesbians along wilh the associ-
ated impact prejudice and stereo-
Iyping have on these communi lies. 

The kids were 
encouraged to do Ihe 
majority of the talking 
in the film, airing 
their views and confu -
sion aboul gay issues. 
Most i nstruc l or~ 
asked I hei r students 
- from grades one 
through eight - 10 

brainslorm lists of words associ-
ated with homosexuals, and to 
consi der where they receive 
inform<l tion about gays and les-
bians. While keeping within Ihe 
realm of di scrimination, their aim

WHIRLING DERVISHES 
Turkish dance troupe to perform at UCSD 

Cou~esy of University Events 
The Whirling Dervishes will perform in the Man-
deville Auditorium on Saturday at 8 p.m. 

By leslie Wane 
Guardian Reporter 

"Dazed by the marvels of 
love. our whirling endures," 
wrote Mevlana Rum i, the pre-
eminent poet of Islam during 
the 13th century Ottoman 
Empire. 

These words were to be 
prophetic, serving as the basis 
for founding the world-famous 
Whirling Dervishes of Turkey. 
This dance troupe belungs to 
the Mevley i secl of orthodox 
Islam, which was begun in 
Rumi 's name. For 700 years 
Ihis sect has kept ali ve the reli -

gious tradition of "whirling to 
ecstasy," a dance that was 
banned earl ier in this century. 
Those that have lickets to thi s 
weekend 's performance at 
Mandeville should cheri sh 
them, for like all of the ' 
Dervishes' engagements, thi s 
one is sold out. 

The ceremony of the 
Whirling Dervi shes is a highly 
structured act of faith, utilizing 
12 male dancers in huge bil-
lowing skirts and 12 accompa-
nying musicians. The dance is 
meant to symboli ze a form of 
escape from the bondage of 

life on earth. It begins with an 
introduction conducted by the 
"master," who knows the 
entire Koran by heart, and is 
followed by a four-part danc-
ing ceremony. 

Spinning incessantl y, Ihe 
dancers stri ve to aehieye a 
stale of enl ightened trance as 
the music changes from si mple 
to mesmerizing. Throughout 
the ritual the perfonners chant 
Islamic poetry. promoting the 
ideals of love and self-knowl -
edge thai will take them into a 
hig her appreciation of Allah. 
Eac h gestu re made by Ihe 

dancers, and even each gar-
ment of their clothing, serves 
to reveal the importance of tra· 
ditional worship. 

The Whirling Dervishes 
first came to the United Stales 
in 1978, and have since 
returned to perform a string of 
sold-out performance in 15 
citi es. Whether it is curiosity 
or faith that draws Ihe audi-
ence to the group 's perfor-
mance at the Mandevi lie Audi· 
tOriUIll this Saturd ay at 8 p.m., 
the Dervishes are sure to teach 
a spi ri tual lesson while they 
entertain.

L 7, Joan Jett , and Seven Year 
Bitch, as well as Pcrry's ex-band 
reflect the sound resonant of Stone 
Fox. This "sound" definitely leaves 
something to he desired. Such an 
album is just another lame attempt 
at copying and slightly mutating 
gi rl rock hy adding a nash of glam. 
The four women and one man who 
make up the Stone Fox recreate a 
sound which is loud, obnoxious

been exhausted by hands such as 
Hole and that nobody wants to hear 
anymore.

of Monty Python fame. as well as 
other well-known British actors, 
such as Roben Lindsay and Ron-
nie Corbett, all of whom have 
roles as Ihe keepers of Ihe various 
animals found in the park . 

Sexual, and to a lesser extent , 
physical humor play very strong 
roles in "Fierce Creatures ." 
From Rod McCain 's constant 
flatulence to scantily clad 
zookeepers racing around the 
park , "Creatures" draws heavily 
from British humor, remini scent 
of "Fawhy Towers," and other 
comedies playing on PBS. 

However, although there are

definite similarities, it seems 
that '-Creatures" attempts to fuse 
both British and American 
humor. leaving the film lost 
somewhere in the middle. It is 
an interesting change from the 
regular comedy formula 10 
which we are accustomed, but 
ultimately, despite several gen -
uinely funny moments, "Crea-
tures" fail s to adequately sup-
port the film. 

"Fie rce Creatures" is an 
altempt to I:apitalize on what 
was, in "A Fi sh Called Wanda," 
an immensely successful combi-
nation of actors and filmmakers . 
This current release, however, 
fails to capture the essence of the 
original collaboration, and while 
perhaps holding its own individ -
ually, "Fierce Creatures" pales 
when inevitably compared to it 's 
predecessor. 

On her newest release, 
TeJegram, Bjork teams up with a 
diverse pallet of producers and 
artists to recreate nine songs from 
last year's Pust album, with onc 
new track to bool. Bjork - aside 
from her two major-label solo 
releases Dehut and POoft - is also 
known for hcr work with the 
visionary Sugarcuhes in the late 
'80s.

TROY: UCSD challenged the home squad in an epic struggle, but fell in four games to USC 
But nothing was beller than the 

''freestyle'' exhibition. Predator and

area of the track where there was a 
bank of crushed cars. Each truck 
took its tum plowingoverthejunked

Meanwhile, in the foreground, 
the driver of Monster Patrol showed 
his skills by exiting the cab (while 
the truck was in motion, mind you) 
and "surfing" on the aerodynamic 
wing affixed to the bed of the truck. 

To add LO the viewing pleasure of 
the spectators, Monster Jam also 
feat ured Dune Buggies, Quad Wars, 
"Ruff Trux" and a daredevil 
stuntman who attempted to jump 
his caroverthree crushed cars parked 
end-to-end. 

I found it rather I:omical when 
some unfortunate Dune Buggy 
racer landed wrong and broke both 
of his axles - hi s tires completed

There is but one word that can

make a point to do so as I can now 
safely say that Motorsports are not

When the Odysseus-led Greeks 
captured the fortress city of Troy 
during the Trojan War, they ar-

ri ved inside a large 
wooden horse and 
during th e night 
abandoned the horse 
and sacked the 
stronghold. 

Centuries later,

volleyball team at-

tempted to attack and capture an-
other Trojan fortress, this one on 
the campus of the University of 
Southern California. 

While the Greeks arrived stra-
tegically camouflaged in their 
rake steed, the Tritons arrived in 
a much more easily identifiable 
passenger van. Apparently the 
new-age Trojans had learned from 
their ancient ancestors' mistake 
and were ready when UCSD 
pulled up to their gates.

With the element or surprise 
thrown out the window, the Tri -
tons stepped Oft the court hoping 
Lo put to use some of the lessons 
they had learned during their 
matches against the University of 
Hawaii. 

Having played tough against a 
top-ranked opponent away from 
home. UCSD now faced a USC 
team that featured a larger frontline 
than Hawaii with an intimidating 
hlock. 

Facing an aggressive Trojan at -
tack, the UCSD offense had some 
trouble finding its footing in the 
first two games. WiLh 12 errors and 
only five kills in the rirst gamc, the 
Tritons looked to regain the mo-
mentum that they had gathered 
against Hawaii. 

The start of the second game 
meant continued stru ggles for 
UCSD, as the Trojans capita li zed 
on the inconsistent servi ng of the 
Tritons that result.ed in 18 service 
errors.

erful inside game. Jungwinh leads 
the team in rebounding, averaging 
9. 1 per game. Point guard Cindy 
Yamasaki has been great from the 
outside, Icading the team with 21 
three-pointers. 

She also leads Lhe team in as-
sists (47) and steals (37). The last 
senior starter is Pam Contini. who 
has heen the glue keeping this 

By the Lhird game, UCSD had 
found iLsown Odysseus in the form 
of senior outside hiller Eric Mai. 
After faltering early, the Venice 
Beach product began to find his 
groove on the offensive end. 

"Eric was our go-to guy again, 
justlikc he was in Hawaii," Triton 
Head Coach Duncan McFarland 
said. "He got off to kind of a shaky 
start in the first game and then he 
found his rhythm - we sLarted to 
give him the kind of sets that he 
needs." 

Eventually finding his foml, Mai 
finished the match with a team-
high 26 kills . With the UCSD of-
fense waking from its slumber, the 
Tritons began to storm the gates of 
Troy in search of an upset. With a 
strong blocking frontline led by 
senior Matt Minehan, UCSD was 
able to get back into the match by 
taking the third game, 15-12. 

With dreamsorsacking the Tro-
jans just as the Greeks had, the 
Tritons continued their strong play 

lineup together. She has logged 
the most minutes. and is always 
doing the lillie things 10 help the 
cause. 

As the Tri tons look to the sec-
ond half of the season, they have 
a long road ahead of them. Seven 
of their last nine regular-season 
games are on the road . But in 
order 10 reach their Final Four 
goal, the women must learn to 

in the fourth game. USC changed 
its lineup and the substitutes com-
milled a series of errors that al-
lowed UCSD to take a command-
ing 14-8 lead. 

Sensing a possible tragedy in 
the making, USC returned its start-
ing lineup to the floor. Only one 
point away from forcing a decisive 
fifth game, the Tritons were unable 
to convert agai nst the fired -up Tro-
jans and saw the game slip away, 
16-14. 

"Weblew a huge opportunity to 
go intoa lifth game with [USC] and 
get an upseL," McFarland said. 
'That was the tough part - but the 
good pan was that we battled and 
hung in again t a good team and put 
ourselves into position to possibly 
upsetlhem." 

While UCSD was unable to rep-
licate the feat of the Greeks, the 
Tritons continued to better them-
selves for further conquesLs, includ-

National Championship.

UCSD is 5- I away from RIMAC 
this season . 

Barring a complete disaster, 
UCSD will be represented in Lhe

ever playoff game. This year, they 
are looking to rewrite the record 
books and reach the Final Four in

A fter several years of hoping and

da.y at th e 
Canyonvi ew Pool.

six teams involved will be permil-

UCSD, which boasls a rosIer full 
of adepl swimmers, faces the diffi -
cult task of deciding who will repre-

depth," Triton Head Coach Doug 
Boyd sa id . 

Regardless, the ent ire Triton 
squad will he on hand to support the 
team.

said. "Usually you' re husy for your-

self and Imeanwhile! cheering on
