Federal officials stop in 
San Diego to seeking input 

By MAlIC GLUNANA 
Senior Staff Writer 

About 40 UCSD students 
rallied outside the Wyndham 
Emerald Hotel on Nov. 20 wear-
ing T-shirts and bunons marked 
with the slogan, "save Title IX." 
The rally was held to show a 
panel of federally appointed 
commissioners that they support 
the law, which the commission-
ers are currently analyzing. 

The commissioners are trav-
eling to cities across the nation 
to listen to public input on the 
maner of Title IX. After hearing 
public input from across the 

nation, the commissioners will 
present a report on their find-
ings to U .S. Secretary of 
Education Rod Paige. 

The Feminist Majority 
Leadership Alliance coordinated 
the protest event. The 40 pro-
testers chanted sayings, includ-
ing, "Ho ho, hey hey, TItle IX 
has got to stay." Students also 
waved signs that said, "support 
women's sports," and, "demand 
equality." One police officer 
came to the protest upon request 
of the hotel due to noise.

UC offers employees 
new retirement plan 

By THOMAS NEELEY 
Associate News Editor 

The UC Board of Regents 
announced a new retirement 
program for employees at their 
Nov. 14 meeting that is set to go 
into effect on April 1,2003. 

Under the plan, the equiva-
lent of 5 percent of a qualifying 
employee's salary would go 
toward a special account called 
the Capital Accumulation 
Provision, where the money 
would earn an unspecified rate 
of interest. That rate is current-
Iy.about 7.5 percent. 

The decision was made in 
part because of lowered state tax 
revenue and budget cutbacks, 
which decreased the overall 
amount of salary raises that the 
university said it could offer for 

UC employees. Systemwide, the 
university expects to offer salary 
increases of 1.5 percent. 

"Since we are only able to give 
modest raises on a systemwide 
basis this year due to the state's 
budget deficit, we wanted to try 
to find additional forms of 
rewarding people financially," 
said Judy Boyene, associate vice 
president for human resources 
and benefits at the UC Office of 
the President. "And even though 
this doesn't increase employees' 
incomes immediately, it does give 
them a financial boost later on." 

Those employees eligible for 
the pro ram need to be mem-
bers 0 the UC Retirement 
Plan, which includes career 
employees and employees who

Blacklist alleged 
by grad student 
Professor disputes claims; 

Grad student faces dismissal 
By PARISA BAHARIAN 

Senior Staff Writer 

Former graduate student 
Edward Olano faces dismissal 
from UCSD without receiving a 
doctorate in mechanical and 
aerospace engineeri!lg because 
of alleged blacklisting by the 
university. 

Olano said that his former 
advisor and professor, Forman 
Williams of the mechanical 
aerospace and engineering 
department and the director of 
the Center of Energy Research, 
deliberately set out to destroy 
his chances of successfully com-
pleting a doctorate after a per-
sonal disagreement. A student 
of Peruvian descent, Olano also 
stated that students of color at 
UCSD face a hostile academic 
environment on a regular basis. 

Olano contends that when he 
began the process to retake his 

qualifying exam, Williams 
opposed him. 

"When I was ready to retake 
my Ph.D . exam, Williams said 
that if I retook it, he would fail 
me," Olano said. "Williams gave 
me three options: to take the 
exam and fail, to quit the school 
or to do whatever 1 desired." 

In an interview, Forman dis-
puted the validity of Olano's 
version of the events. 

"1 never told him I'd fail him 
if he retook the exam," Williams 
said. "I did everything humanly 
possible to help him." 

Olano said that he choose to 
retake the exam to stay on track 
to receive his Ph.D . 

At his May 30, 2001, candi-
dacy exam, Olano said he 
believes that he passed all three 
parts of the exam, but Williams 
told him he failed.

Triton Plus is now accepted 
off campus at Chipotle and

now been implemented at these 
three locations, to be eventually 
followed by others. 

"Chipotle, Islands ~nd Baskin-

active right now," said Mark 
Cunningham, director of H&DS. 
"There are seven others that we

BRIEFLY ETCETERA ••• 
UCSD co-develops 

behavior health program 
The Center fo r Community-based 

Research In Older People With Psychoses, a 
new program designed to develop effective 
new therapies for middle-aged and elderly 
people With schizophrenia and other chron-
IC psychotIC disorders. is being conducted 
by the UCSD School of Medicine In collabo-
ration With the San Diego County Health 
and Human Services Agency's Adult and 
Older Adult Mental Health Services. 

The program, which addresses an 
Impending crrSIS with the growing number 
of middle-aged and elderly indiViduals with 
psycho IC disorders. IS funded by a $7.5 mil-
Iron, five-year grant to UCSD from the 
Nanonal Institute of Mental Health. UCSD 
was chosen for the award based on its 
expertise In older-adult mental health, espe-
Cially In the area of psychotic disorders. For 
the past 10 years, UCSO's Dilip Jeste. who 
is the program's principle investigator, has 
had the only NIMH-funded center specifi-
cally devoted to studying middle-aged and 
older adults with psychotic disorders. 

In the fi rst year of the program, UCSD 
and AMHS will gather detailed information 
about the prevalence of psychiatric and 
medical problems, use and cost of services 
and quality of care in middle-aged and older 
persons with schizophrenia and related psy-
chotic disorders in San Diego County. For 
the next four years, the program will focus 
on the development and f€finement of 
Interventions to improve access to medical 
and psychiatric services and quality of care. 

As the baby-boomer generation ages, the 
number of people in the United States over 
65 is projected to double from about 35 mil-
lion today to nearly 70 million by 2030. 
Schizophrenia currently affects about 1 per-
cent of the population. One area of interest 
for the program is the possibility of remission 
of schizophrenia in old age, as illustrated in 
the recent Oscar-winning movie "A Beautiful 
Mind: which was based on the true life story 
of Nobel laureate John Nash.

Heroes: What the New Brain Science Reveals 
About How We Become 'NIlo We Are:' 

The book, which was published by 
Morrow Press at Harper-Collins, introduces 
the science of cultural biology, which 
explains the complex relationship between 
genes and environment that shapes the 
human brain and affects - for better or for 
worse - .human behavior. 

The book details how human interaction 
can result in extremely complex behavior. 
Among the chapters of the book IS an 
examination of the Columbine High School 
massacre, which takes into consideration 
the effects of violent video games and high 
school social hierarchy. The authors also 
contrast the uncommon violence shown by 
the terrorists on Sept. II, 2001 , with the 
uncommon compassion shown by 
stra ngers In the aftermath. 

NOAA establishes marine 
tech center at UCSC 

A Center for Marine Technologies will be 
established by UC Santa Cruz with a $2 mil-
lion grant from the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration. The center will 
use new technological approaches to study 
the processes driVing the highly productive 
coastal upwelling ecosystems along the 
California coast. 

The airn of the center, which brings 
together an interdisciplinary group of 
researchers from five partner institutions 
around Monterey Bay, is to establish the 
scientific basis for effective monitoring and 
management of these ecosystems, as well 
as the fisheries and other resources associ-
ated with them. 

The other partners are the Monterey 
Bay Aquarium Research Institute, the 
Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, 
Moss Landing Marine Laboratories and the 
National Marine Fisheries Service 
Laboratory in Santa Cruz, Calif. The 
Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary 
is also participating. 

The California coast is one of just five 
major coastal upwelling regions in the 
world, all of which account for 95 percent of 
the global marine biomass and more than 
21 percent of the world's fisheries. 

The co-directors of the center will be 
Margaret McManus, assistant professor of 
ocean sciences at UCSC, and Jeffrey 
Paduan, associate professor of oceanogra-
phy at the Naval Postgraduate School and 
an associate adjunct professor of ocean sci-
ences at UCSc.

elections . 

Brown said that the A.S. Council at UCSD 
will probably be receiving notice soon from 
the UC Office of the President mandating 
that the AS. Council remove its spending 
caps as well . Currendy, three of six college 
councils do not recognize slates and may have 
to begin acknowledging them, Brown specu-
lated. 

Brown reported that she is working to 
secure the $100,000 of state money that was 
given to UCSD for the Srudent Initiated 
Outreach and Recruionent program by this 
quarter. The repon that was written by last 
year's SIORC committee is currently under 
review by Vice Chancellor of Srudent Mfairs 
Joseph Watson. 

Brown reported that her favorite event of 
the year, th e African-American Student 
Union's Kwanzaa Celebration, will be held on 
Nov. 25 in the Price Center Ballroom. Brown 
urges all srudents to attend . 

Brown also reported that Chancellor 
Robert C. Dynes will be giving n State of the 

a m pus Add ress on ov. 22 a t noon ill the 

Price Center Ball room. She urges all students 
to attend. 

Brown also sa id that she is proud of the

favor of unisex bathrooms. 

Commissioner of Academic Affairs Halle 
Beitollahi 

Beitollahi reported that Garo 
Bournoutian was present at the meeting to 
answer questions regarding his nomination 
for representative to the Ad missions 
Committee. Bournoutian was present 
because council members wanted to speak 
with him before approving him for the com-
mittee. No members of co uncil asked 
Bournoutian questions, but his e-mai l 
address was announced for all of those wish-
ing to ask him questions. 

Beitollahi reponed that she is still working 
on her un-named project which 5he addressed 
at last week's council meeting. She has not 
revealed the content of the project, but stated 
that things are not running as smoothly as she 
had expected. 

Commissioner of Athletics Robin Shelton 
Shelton reported that men 's water polo

Commissioner of Programming Gabe 
Grossman 

Grossman reported that the 
Programming Office began talking with 
other universities about bands that they are 
booking. He said that from talking with

U[ challenged Williams, as I 
belicved 1 answered all the ques-
tions to satisfacti on," Olano said. 
"When I asked to retake the exam, 
Wi ll iams said it would be a waste 
of time and that I should explore 
other areas." 

Williams sa id that after 
Olano's performance on the first 
exam, it did not appea r likely that 
Ola no would ever pass. 

"Based on the performance on 
the first exam, I knew that he 
could not pass," Williams said. 
"50 I encouraged him to look at 
other areas." 

Olano rakes issue with 
Williams' judgment on his acade-
mic abi li ty. 

"I don 't know how Williams 
could corne up with that assess-
ment of my academic abili ty when 
I demonstrated excellent aptitude 
in his very own class of gas 
dynamics, in which I received an 
A," Olano said . 

Olano's grade point average, 
obtained from the MAE's spring 
2000-01 evaluations, showed an 
overall GPA of 3.028 within the 
department and a GPA of 3.54 
within his 3rea of specialization in 
combustion. 

When he attempted to switch 
advisors within the MAE depart-
ment, Olano alleges that he was at 
first welcomed, then shunned. 

" Professor Kalyanasundaram 
Seshadri said he would take me 
into his group, but that he needed 
to as k Williams for advice," Olano 
said . "A few days later, [ called 
him and he said he had to protect 
himself and couldn't offer me a 
place in his group."

The UCSD Guardran IS published twICe a week at the University of 
CaHOIma at San Diego Contents (e) 2002. Views expressed herein 

replesent the majori ty vote of the editOrial board and are not necessar· 
Ily those 01 the U( Board of Regents,·the ASU(SD or the members of 

the Guardlon staff. 

Tuition hikes are 
needed to ensure 

UC's quality 
Facing the possibi li ty of a 20 percent cut in 

state funding for the 2003-04 academic year, 
the UC Regents have passed a preliminary 

bud~et that considers two options for making 
up the lost funding: Either the Regents raise 
tuition by 6.5 percent, thereby generating 
about $49 million, or they depena on state 
legislature to pick up the tab, 

Compared to other wuversities of the same 
caliber, the average tuition to attend a UC 

~chool is extremely low: just $3 ,429 per year. 
Raising tuition 6.5 percent would cost Stu-
dents an additional $225. \Vhile it is true that 
thi. amoun t would mean the difference 
between some people being able to go to a 
UC school and llaving to attend a less expen-
Sive school , higher education is already - and 
to some extent probably always will be - an 
unattainable Imurv for some; and there will 
continue to be chea\Jer options for these stu-
dents, such as Califonua State Universities 
and commWlit\' colleO'es, In addition, the 
regents reduced tuition by 10 percent in 1994, 
meaning that any pending IIlcreases would 
merelv restore this loss of revenue rather than 
set an' all-time high for UC tuition, 

The Cniversit), of California is one offew 
public universities that can boast not having 
to raise tuition once in the past eipht years, 
T() rely on the legislature to foot the bill for 
a below-cost education instead of raising 
fees (which would be considered routine at 
universities of lesser stature) is ridicu lous, 

[l~ving not seen an increase si nce 1994, it 
would he naive for us to think that there 
won'r be one in the futu re, whether the leg-
I lature forks over the money or not, It is 
bener to endure a small increase now rather 
than a huge increase later. 

Alternatives to rai ing tuition include cut-
tlllg research programs, delaying restoration 
on equipment and technology, and reducing 
money fur sUidem services. All of these 
options boil down to one thing: cutting the 
pro"rams and services that make tnis a wor~d-c1ass universi~ in the first place, 

As the Regents fmd themselves sharply 
divided over the issue of a fee hike, the 
Guardian urges them to give the state a 
break ::ll1 d ask students to pay a little more 
for what they're already getting at a steal.

Kenrick Leung/Cuord,on 

UCSD should teach more about six colleges 
Many ignorant applicants select a college at random 

BY EVELYN HSIEH 
Staff Writer 

Back when we were still wide-eyed , 
naive high school seniors, getting into 
college was the ultimate objective. 
Autumn was domi nated by a flurry of 
SAT score reports, application packets 
and final exam-type anxiety. A typical 
seni or's tra in of thought might have 
gone something like this: "This verbal 
score isn't good enough for Cal! I 
should take It again ... Ugh, why is Mr. 
Smith so slow on mv recommendation: 
Maybe tllere are j~st too many good 
things to say about me ... What's this: A 
college selection for UCSD? I thought 
UCSD iVflS a college ... oh screw it, I'll 
just close my eyes and pick one ... " 

Thus begins the path of the unin-
fOflm:u prospective UCSD student. 
UCSD may be unique and extraordi-
nary with its ix-college sys tem , btlt it 
shou ld do a better job of informing 
potential students about the impor-
tance of coll ege choi ce. 

UCSD is distinctive in d,at it sup-
posedly combinc an in timate liberal 
arts coll ege atmosphere with a large 
university's plethora of o ptions and 
opportunities. We 've all hea rd it 
before in campus tours or admission 
represematives' spiels: UCS D is the 
best of both worlds in the best envi-
ronment, in, coincidentally, the best 
state in the best country on the best 
planet. ot exactly a hard sell. 

What these smiley faces don't 
emphasii'.e strongly enough , or perhaps 
whlt prospective freshmen do not lis-
ten to attentively enough, is the crucial 
choice of college . The fact that college 
choice determines both gene ral ed uca-
tion requirements and living area 
should only reinforce the need to bet-
ter inform high school applicants. 
Nary a day goes by that I don't over-

'hea r an obvious freshman whining 
about his core curriculum or discussing 
qualms about his college. 

CAMPUS 

" A lack of knowledge on an 
applicant's behalf hinders 

them from gleaning as 
much enjoyment as they 

possibly could." 
In the colorful brochure offered at 

the admissions office, there are plenty 
of glossy pictures of a smiling (surprise, 
surprise) and diverse studcnt popula-
tion, sweeping shots of eucalyptus trees, 
and of course, the requisite panoramic 
of tlle campus to remind sntdents yet 
again that yes, wc a,'e by the beach, In 
between are descriptions of the col-
leges, including general education 
requirements and college-specific stu-
dent organizations. The primed pur-
pose of each ('ollege is written as well. 

But to an applicant, " Dimensions of 
Culmre" might as well be a foreign 
phrase. Furthermore, each "focus" of 
the college is explained in a generic, do-
gootl- for- the-world fa hion, malcing 
dlem difficult to distinguish from one 
another, I've talked to far too many snt-
dents who were unfortunate enough to 

blindly choose their college and 
inevitably regret it later. G rantt!d, all 
colleges have their quirks and qualities 
and probably do offer a somewhat equal 
level of an enjoyable under!!:radl1<lte 
experience. Howe-ver, a lack of knowl -
edge on an applicant's behalf hinders 
them from gleaning as much enjoyment 
as they possible could . A double 110n-
science major in Revelle College mJ)' 
find it possible to gr:Jduute in four ye:lrs, 
and an engincer in Eleanor Roosevelt 
College might be able ro take summer 
school , bur had they known more about 
dleir college, they could avoid the 
unnecessary headache. 

How might this he accomplished: 
The approach should be two-fold : 
first, to emphasize what exactly the 
college system encompasses and ful -
fills; second, to better delineate the 
aspects of each college. Perhaps the 
brochure should elimin ate one smil ing 
photo and replace it wi tl, a notice that 
stresses the importance of college 
choice . Maybe admissions represe nta-
tives could make one extra push about 
it after their effusive praise. Or o ne of 
those many lerters/advenisemems sent 
to recruit students could addrcs the 
issue. And certainly it's partially the 
student's responsibility to become a 
better-informed applicant. 

In addition, the individual collcges 
themselves could take part in educat-
ing their prospective and current Snt-
dents as well , Tills might include giv-
ing separate presentations on Open 
House or Admit Day, or distributing 
sheets or packets that better elaborate 
the goal and curriculum of each col-
lege, Aside from pi cnlres of their facil -
ities (which would in fact be very hdp-
ful l, these material ' could elaborate on 
the common interests of their students, 
the core curriculum's purpose and a 
more detailed outline of the focus and 
relation to its name ake, Applica nts

THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 21, l002 THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 5 

LEIIER TO THE EDITOR 
Guardian coverage of 

bathroom issue lacking 
though they didn't even bother to 
read the resolution. The issue is 
not that transgendered people "feel 
uncomfortable" or "may be 
unsure" choosing a bathroom "due 
to the ambiguity of their sexual 
identity." The issue is that students 
are, as the resolution states, "con-
fronted and harassed when 
attempting to use gender-specitlc 
bathrooms." That they think this is 
just about transgendered people 
being confused, and that they con-
f1ate gender with sexual identity, 
shows that the Guardiall does not 
understand the issue at all. 

Students' e ... mail privacy is not 
adequately protected under law 

Editor: 
The Nov. 14 editorial 

("Endorsement of unisex bath-
rooms an unwise decision") and 
Nov. 12 article ("Unisex bathroom 
resolution passed") make it quite 
clear how ignorant the Gllardian is 
when it comes to issues of gender 
identity. 

Despite the fact that the resolu-
tion discusses three distinct groups 
(parents with children of the oppo-
site sex, students with disabilities, 
and students whose sex is not 
immediately apparent), the 
GUflrdian article and editorial 
focused almost entirely on trans-
gendered sntdents. This allowed 
them to print multiple false 
assumptions and untrue statements 
about transgendered people instead 
of actually addressing the resolu -
tion. 

T he Gum'dian writes, "Unisex 
bathrooms, their supporters argue, 
are good for transgend ered individ-
un Is who feel uncomfortable choos-
ing a gender-specific restroom" 
and " transgendc red individuals, 
who may be unsure of whicb bath-
rooms to use due to the ambiguity 
of thei r sexual identity," 

T hese quares show how igno-
rant the Gum'd,fln is with regards to 
gender identity, :md make it look as 

To prop up their claim that the 
resolution was written because our 
society is "overly sensitive to gen-
der issues" and not in response to 
issues that students on campus are 
bringing up and needs that they are 
trying to address, the Guardiall uses 
fallacious logic, such as: 
"Transgendered individuals would 
be subject to more scrutiny by pass-
ing up gendered bathrooms en 
route ro a unisex stall, opening 
themselves up to more ridicule 
than if they went into a gendered 
bathroom," As though people fol-
low other students around campus 
ro make sure that they didn't hap-
pen to pass a bathroom before they 
go into another one. 

They also printed accusations

'~"'Review 

Parisa Baharian 

Do you ever feel that prick-ly feeling on the back of your neck when you're at 
the computer, as if your every key-
stroke is being monitored? 

No need to call up psychologi-
cal and counseling services quite 
yet; you may not be completely 
paranoid. 

Simply put, there is no such 
thing as an absolute right to priva-
cy in our UCSD e-mai l transac-
tions. 

Forget about your cherished 
rights to privacy, or that the First 
Amendment protects free speech, 
or that the Fourth Amendment 
protects us against unreasonable 
search and seizure without proba-
ble cause - for in the university 
land of e-mail, those constitution-
al safeguards are not g uaranteed. 

H owever, the culprit for our e-
mail vul nerabi lities is n ot only the 
university, because even normal 
nonstudent ci ti zens o f the grand 
01' United States are not bestowed 
with a clear-cut con s t itutional 
right to privacy that includes e-
mail transactions. 

The only current U.S . stanlte 
that even remotely applies to e-
mail privacy is the U .S . Electronjc 
Communications Privacy Act of 
19S9. The code never actually 
mentions e-mail, only "electronic 
communications," The ECPA 
is such a complicated and poorly 
written statute that it creates 

many loopholes and allows viola-
tions to occur unabated by default. 

According to Mike Godwin, 
legal services counsel for the 
Electronic Frontier Foundation , 
the ECPA could be reasonably 
construed to protect university e -
mail by interpreting "electronic 
communications" to encompass e-
mail. 

But currendy, the statute is not 
crystal clear for a fundamental 
right of privacy to e-mail to be 
recognized, It will take some actu-
al effort on the part of lawmakers 

" The ECPA is such a 
complicated and poorly 

4»ritten statute that it cre~ 
~snuany~ophok5and 
allows violations to occur 

unabated lry default ." 
to incl ud e e-mail in the language 
of definitions for the statute of 
exte nsion of privacy, or else a 
court case that can legislate policy 
in place of Congress inaction. 

If the ECPA doesn't guarantee 
a clear fund amenta l right of priva-
cy for e-mail, how ca n we expect 
our power-hungry u niversity offi-
cials to voluntarily give us a right 
that isn't specificall y outlined? 
Furthermore, does this enorl11ous 
constitutional law hol e give the 
necessary mandate for university 
offi cials to snoop through ou r 
UCSD e-mails) 

Our trump card li es in our Bill 

gies you need 

of Rig hts, rele am court cases and 
our California state constitution. 

A U .S, government task force 
investigating the link berween pri -
vacy ancl empl oyees working for 
the government found th~ follow-
ing: "I E-mail! Illoni toring of gov-
ernment employees of actual COIll -
munications and communicators 
may impinge on the 
Constinttional rights of freednl1l 
of speec h (Fi rs t Amendmen t), 
against unreasonable search and 
seizu re (Fourth A.IlIendmcnt), and 
against self-incrimination (Fifth 
amendment), as well as on the 
right to privacy, specifica lly as set 
forth in both the Privacy Act and 
the ECPA." 

If e-mail privacy is purported 
to extend for arguably the most 
unprotected group - governmen t 
employees - then it can e'lsi ly bc 
uti lized on behalf of students at 
public or private universities. 

The Supremc Court cases of 
Grl.l7JJald v, COlll1t'CllClIl and Rot' t '. 
Wade unmistabhly carve out ,I

the government cannot interfere

Colleges: Divisions mean 
more than students realize 

continued /rom page 4 
would, ideally, start getting a more 
coherent idea about each college's 
distinct personality and those of its 
students . After all, part of the 
objective of the multi-college sys-
tem is to divvy up and align stu-
dents' preferences and philosophies 
with those of their college. 

It is very likely that those who 
can better understand and identify 
with their college will better enjoy 
college-specific activities. Each col-
lege's attempt to educate applicants 
could contribute to even a more 
enthused, spirited populace. 
Wouldn't it make sense for some-
one who chose their college, rather 
than randomly select it, to be more 
excited about attending this school? 
Since every applicant has the 
unique privilege of choosing his 
college, they should get the most 
out of it. 

T he effect of any better-
informed community is almost 
assuredly beneficial, and has the 
potential to spill over to other 

areas. Students who can make an 
informed decision about their col-
lege will perhaps be livelier con-
tributors to their individual col-
leges and to the university as a 
whole. Also, in what may be stu-
dents ' first decision concerning 
their collegiate experience, college 
choice serves as a precursor of 
reverberant decisions to come: 
what major to stick with, what 
classes to take and what career path 
to eventually pursue. 

Prospective students need to 
know that the choice they make will 
affect them more than they think it 
does. While many know that UeSD 
is ranked No. 7 among public uni-
versities, many don't know the first 
thing about their own college. With 
a more-informed student comes a 
better experience, as well as a more 
satisfying college and university 
tenure. A physics major in ERC may 
still take the intellecnlal marathon 
through the hell that is Making of 
the Modern World, but at least he 
would have w.mted to.

they should have known were 
unfounded, and falsely attributed 
statements to the resolution. They 
accused Associated Students of 
jumping on the bandwagon of UC 
campuses passing similar resolu-
tions, even though, when asked, I 
told Linda Cheu, the news reporter 
covering the story, that I did not 
even know that there had been sim-
ilar resolutions at other UC 
schools. The ov. 12 article claims 
that the resolution talks about what 
"handicapped people must go 
through in waiting for an available 

wheelchair accessible stall," when, 
in fact, it says that students with 
disabilities "are sometimes forced 
to go search for a bathroom desig-
nated for their se" when there is an 
accessible bathroom for the oppo-
site sex nght in front of them." 

It would be a good idea for the 
GUIlrdian staff to attend an Alliance 
training program and Jearn more 
about LGBT issues before writing 
about them. If you're interested , e-

Advocacy 

Speak: Users should be 
wary of invasion of privacy 

contimll'd from page 5 
provisions was a more focused priva-
cy concern, relating to the accelerat-
ing encroachment on personal free-
dom and security cause by increased 
surveillance · and data collection 
activity in contemporary society." 

Information gathering through 
deco'onic eavesdropping, monitor-
109 of e-matls, etc., seem to fall 
neatly witl}in tile intent of legisla-
tive and judicial jurisdiction of pro-
tection of privacy. 

Thus there is a legitimate foun-
dation in which e-mail transactions 
would be covered under the provi-
sion of right to privacy. Yet this is 
something that isn 't translated into 
UC policy. 

The University of Cali fornia 
Electronic Communications Policy 
bows to many of the federal and 
sta te privacy concerns with regards 
to e-mail, yet instead of providing 
ahsolute rights, it provides ample 
loopholes of wiggle room. 

The policy states in Section 
[VA , "The university respects the 
privacy of electrollic communica-
tions in the same way that it 
respects the privacy of paper corre-
spondence and te lephone conversa-
tions." 

Yet limits and restrictions are 
immediately put in place under 
Appendix C, in which the universi-
ty policy allows for seven general 
conditions that would "trigger a 
non-consensual access" to any elec-
tronic communication, such as e-
mail and phones, without prior 
con ent or knowledge of user. Sixth 
on the list of exceptions is if an 
administrator suspects a snldent or 
organization of some sort of mis-
conduct that is enough to trigger a 

nonconsensual access. The admin-
istrator in question would not have 
to get a warrant to monitor your e-
mail; all he or she would have to do 
is contact the vice chancellor or 
whomever the vice chancellor des-
ignates to handle such requests. 

Inspecting the reported occur-
rences in which non-consensual 
access were sought in the academic 
year of 2000-0 I reveals that UCSD 
sought three such requests, which 
were granted without prior 
approval. UC Davis had the most 
with nine, but all nine were granted 
with prior approval. Overall , the 
reported cases of nonconcensual 
access totals to 23 within that acad-
emic period in the ue system. 

If the numbers are accurate, 23 
cases do not seem al l that bad con-
sidering the enormous student 
population with the UC system. So 
where 's the smoke? 

It may be true that only a small 
number of students might ever 
have to worry about their e-mail 
privacy being invaded - but if 
you're an organization on campus 
that's under fire - such as the eM 
Cafe, or Tbe Koala, or a student 
actively opposing certain university 
actions, or suspected of some sort 
of misconduct - watch your back. 

The bottom line is that the uni-
versity owns our UeSD e-mail 
accounts - therefore, they set the 
rules. And when there is no funda-
mental right guaranteed, it puts all 
students' privacy of e-mail transac-
tions at risk for arbitrary review. 

So the next time you send an e-
mail, I'd be thinking about who 
might be monitoring your every 
mouse click or keystroke just an 
office away.

Chemistry professor J ohn C. 
Wheeler. who has direcr knowl-
edge of the admissions process 
Llsed for Olano, said that the 
decision to not admit Olano into 
the chemistry department whe n 
he applied for transfer was based 
so lely on Olano's academic 
recurd. 

'Olano was no t academically 
competitive in chemi try," 
Wheeler sa id . "He was not in any 
w~y blackliHed in chemistry thar 
I know of." 

Olano disputes 'Wheeler's 
assessment ~nd said he cha l-
lenged this decision bec~use both 
his Hachclor of Scicnce and mas-
ters in chemistry prove that he 
has a strong background in the 
subject. Olano said he requested 
to vicw the file and evaluation 
scnt from .\1A£ to chemistry, but 
the requc,r was denied. 

Based on thi pattern of 
eve nts, Olano bclieves that he has 
been bbcklisted. 

"Thl! initial warm reception 
of all rh e professors I 
appruac hed, then the sudden 
change leads me to believe there 
is something in my file - an 

unfavorable evaluation and/or 
diSCUSSion bctween Williams and 
these professors that influences 
rhem to not accepr me ," Obno 
sa id. 

\Villi ams denies rhat he 'has 
wrinen anything negative about 
Olano in his fi Ie . 

"I have not written something 
in his fil e," Williams sa id. "There 
is no secret file on Edward ." 

Olano alleges thar he has been 
blacklisted as reprisa l for not 
abiding by Williams' decision not 
to retake the candidacy exam. 

"I believe [hat I became black-
listed because I defied the wishes 
of my ex-advisor and choose to 
retake my exa m ," Olano said. 
"Advisors are like gods on this 
campus; they determine whether 

" I have not written 
something in his file ... 
There is no secret file 

on Edward. "

and engineering

Williams refuted Olano's alle-

gations that he has influenced 
any other professor or depart-
ment from accepti ng Olano. 

"I have not talked with any-
one," Wi lli ams said. "I did not 
forbid any colleagues to not take 
Olano - I just don't have that 
power." 

By many accounts, however, 
Wi lli ams' position on campus as 
the director of the Center for 
Energy Research affords him 
some measure of influence. A5 
director of CER, Williams over-
sees large research projects, such 
as the U.S. Departmen t of 
Energy's Virtual Laboratory for 
Technology for Fusion Energy 
Sciences on behalf of Jacob's 
School of Engineering. 

Brie Finegold, the A . . com-
missioner of student advocacy, 
said that she has viewed various 
financial grant documents that

indi.cate rhat Williams brings in a 
substantial amount of money to 
the university. 

"From the records I wa able 
to gain access to, Williams 
brought in over $2 mill ion of 
gra nts in the 2000 fiscal year to 
the school of engineering," 
Finegold said . "This is a signifi-
cant amount of mon ey for 
resea rch, espccially when 
research is the basis for UCSD's 
cxistence. " 

Olano said he then went 
through informal resolution 
channel s with the Office o f 
G raduate Student and Affairs, 
which dragged on for over a year. 
O n Oct. 15, 2002, Obno said 
that he received a formal letter 
from the OGSR Dean Richard 
Attiyeh dismissing his claim of 
discrimi nation and blacklisting. 

Attiyeh said that he could not 
discuss the case due to student 
privacy, except to say that there 
was an investigation that did not 
find merit in Olano's allegations. 

"Edward Olano 's case has 
been reviewed, and I believe the 
outcome is both fair and appro-
priate," Attiyeh said . 

Olano cites th e OGSR griev-
ance process as part of his overall 
case aga inst the university, alleg-
ing that an impartial investiga-
tion did not take place. 

"It was obvious that it wasn't a 
rea l investigation, for OGSR JUSt 
sided with the department and 
professor," Olano said. 

Finegold said that Ol anu's 
story of discrimination and pro-
fessor reprisal is not the only 
such case on the UCSD campus. 

"Whar happened to Edward 
happens a lot at UCSD; it was 
just not something we knew was 
happening until Edwa rd went 
public," Finegold said. " Beca use 
of his story posted on his Web 
site at www.sllveth fJtlldents.org, 
many grad uate students have 
CO llle forward sharing their expe-
riences and my office is working 
wi th them." 

One such . student, Joan 
Esnayra, a former graduare stu-
dent of UCSD's biology depart-
ment now wo rking for the 
National Academy of Sciences, 
said she fa ced reprisal and ~ Iack-

CU11[inued from page 1 
tilt: FMLA, said that the event was 
successful and participants came 
from various groups across campus. 

Student protesters attended the 
rally for various reasons. Many of 
the protesters partici pa ted beca use 
they believe in the value of the 
o pportunities that Title IX has 
provided fnr women and girls. 

Former UCSD crew member 
Amanda Malmquist said that she 
attended to show support for the 
work she believes Title IX has 
done. 

"r think today we take for grant-
ed that things are equal, or close to 
equal, and without Title IX, it 
wouldn't be that 
way at all ," 
Malmquist said. 

" 

tl1at it is because of Title IX that 
men's sports have suffered. 

The issue of men' sports suffer-
ing from Title IX 1V,1S debated 
before the panel of commiSSIOners. 

Economics professor Andrew 
Zimalist of Smith College argued 
that Title IX has not financiall y 
hurt men's athletics, but it has been 
the big budget sport of men's bas-
ketball and football that have been 
detrimental to some reams. 

Zimalist argued before the panel 
that the best way to save teams from 
being cut is to change the practice 
of averaging 85 players on scholar-
ships and 31 walk-ons per National 
Collegia te Athletic Association 

Di vision I football 

Meghan Lake, 
an Earl Warren 
College junior who 
pi a yed tennis in 
high school , also 
attended the rally 
to show her sup-
port for Tt tie IX. 

TItle IX has 

teams to having an 
average of 60 play-
ers. Zimalist sa id 
tha t these types of 
changes would not 
be detrimental to a 
football team and 
would free enough 
funds to maintain 
smaller men's 
SPOrtS, such as 
wrestling, that have 
traditionally been 

revolutionized the 
way women's sports 

are viewed," 
"Ti tle IX has 

revolutionized the 
way women's sports 
are viewed," Lake 
said, who believes 

- Meghan Lake, 
Eart Warren College junior 

that before Tttle IX, women 's sports 
were not taken seriously. 

The views of protesters echoed 
the thoughts of Nicky 
McCrimmon of the Women 's 
National Basketball Association's 
Los Angeles Sparks. McCrimmon 
spoke at the Cross Cui tural Center 
on Nov. 18 about the benefits of 
Title IX and the need to keep 
pushing to fully enforce the law. 

McCrimmon spoke about 
growing up and having to play on 
boys teams because there were no 
womens basketball teams. When 
she did play on girls' teams, she 
said that the boy's team wou ld have 
more opportunities to travel and 
would receive better equipment 
than the gi rls. 

"It wasn't fair to us," sai d 
McCrimmon, who believes that 
Title IX needs to conti nue to be 
pushed for full enforcement. 

Protesters received both posi-
tive and negative feedback from 
passers-by on the street. One man 
on his way to work told protesters 

cut. 
President of 

Neinas Spons Services Chuck 
Neinas countered Zima list's argu-
ment, saying that football pro -
grams should not be changed to 
accommodate women's ath letics. 

"J ust because your daughter 
doesn't want to play volleyball 
shouldn 't mean that your sun Gl n-
not play football," Neinas said . 

Issues like the proportionality 
rule were also debated before the 
panel. One aspect of gender cqui ry 
under Title IX calls for a propor-
tional number of male and female 
athletic opportunities according to 
the statistical male-female makeup 
of the instinltion . 

There were about 200 audience 
members in attendance at the pan-
elist hearing, inc ludi ng the -HJ

of last .. year's A.S. Council 

cuntinued from page 1 
appeal to students. 

Cu nningham cited the innova-
tion of last year's A.S. Council's 
idea to expand Triton Plus off 
campus. 

"A.S. came to us last year and 
asked us about this," Cunningham 
sa id. "Wc arc a scrvice organi za-
tion and stlldents are important to 
liS , but we actually hadn't thought 
about doing this un til A.S . 
brought it to our attention." 

A .. President Jenn Brown, 
who was A.S. vice president inter-
nal at the time that the counci l 
made the proposition to H&DS, 
said that Cuningham's office was 
very supportive of the idea to 
expand Triton Plus off campus, 
though somewhat preoccupied 
wi th the imple mentation of its 
One Rate plan . 

"We brought the idea up to 
[H& DSI rwo sUlllmers ago, and 
they liked the idea, but they were 
reail y busy with the One Rate 
plan ," Brown said. "So their mar-
keting team didn 't take it on until 
this last summer."

ing delayi ng restOration of ' tate-

Another challenge the 
University of Ca lifornia faces, 
Pryate l s;id, is the addi tional 
enrollment of 8,000 undergradu-
ates the university must carry in 
the 2003-04 school yea r. Four 
rhousand of these students are 
considered' "overenrolled," mean-
ing that the state is not providing 
the fu nding for them. In 2002-03, 
UCSD was overenroll ed by 500 
students. 

The Regents' proposal will 
now be ana lyzed by Gov. Gray 
Davis' budget oftlce. Davis, who 
has ye t to specify to where the 
rema ining $750 million in reduc-
tions for the 2002-03 state budget 
wdl be made, i expected to pre-
~e llt his budget proposal to a leg-
islatlve analys t in January. 

"It's still early in the process," 
Hayward said. "We reall y won 't 
have a good ense as to what the 
state's budget priorities are for a 
couple months ."

"Wi th Cityshuttle, students are 
now goi ng ri ght by [La Jolla 
Vi ll age Square]," Cunningham 
said. " It just made so much sense 
to me [to expand Tri tonPlusj." 

Cunningham addressed specu-
lation that the expansion of Triton 
Plus off campus may have a nega-
tive impact on dining fac ilities on 
campus. 

"[Th e on-campus faciliries j 
have a ca ptured m arket," he said. 
"[The expansion] isn 't going to 
change where 1 have lunch. \Ne're 
tryi ng to be judiciolls. To me, the 
custome r sti ll has a lot of chOIC-
es," 

Cunningham has high hopes 
for the s llccess of the TritonPlus 
expansion . 

"I think it's going to be dri ven 
by customers, but it's really going 
to be LIp to the merchants to see 
how it goes."

listing by the biology department 
after she reported sexual harass-
ment in the lab and also when she 
requested a time extension due to 
her disability. 

Esnayra said she stepped for -
ward to co rroborate Ola no's 
claims of an unaccommodating 
university w hen faced with dis-
putes bctween students and pro-
fessors, since it took her nine 
yea rs to resolve her complaints. 

" In the later stage of my case 
against the university, the biology

an extension of time to complete 
my Ph.D. based on a documented

Attiyeh," Es nayra said. "Yet my 
request was denied without any 
officia l justi fication ." 

However, Esnayra sn id her

Kitcher, now a philosophy

A Former student affairs offi-

By STEPHANIE LEE 
Daily Californian (UC Berkeley) 
(-WIRE) BERKELEY, 

C.llif. - After ca lling on the 
FBI to respond to allegations 
surrounding it~ Invo lvement on 
the UC Berkeley ca mpus during 
the 1960s, Sen. Dianne 
Feinstein SJid she is dissatisfied 
with the response dicited by her 
inquiry. 

Fell1stein, whose conressional 
cOlllmittee 3uthoriry includes 
FBI oversight, penned her 
request to the FBI last June after 
the publication of an investigative 
report by thl! all FrOlIC/.fm 
Cbroll/de. 

The report exposed the FBI s 
dTons to ou,t thcn-UC 
President Clark Kerr and rem vc 
Idnst faculty. 

Finding rhe FBI', response to 
be "1\1;ufflciclll," Feinstein pluns 
to I'o"ow LI p on thc agency's prac-

tJ c~s within the next few days, 
,a Id FClnstclI1 ; pokesperson Scott 
Gerber. 

"[fein5tein) felt that" the 
/FBI's) re pOllses did not fully 
amwer the questions," Gerber 
said. " In the future , he's going 
to seek better and fuller 
answers ." 

UC officials praised the 
C~ll1fornia senator's search for 
answers rcgarding FB I involve-
Illent at C Berkeley. 

"We ' re very appr eciative and 
gratefu l to the senator for pur-
suillg thi s," aid Scott Sudduth, 
UC assistant vice president . 

"Any individua l who h as 
been the subject o f an all eged 
investigation and effort to taint 
someo n e's name [has] the right 
to ge t to the bottom of suc h 
issues. " 

The Chrollicle reported that 
the FBI, in collusion wi th a for-
mer head of the CIA, attempted 
to have Kerr re m ove d from 
office . 

Kerr was described in FBI 
reports as a "liberal " and "at best, 
a highl y controver sial fi gure in 
Cal ifornia educatio n. " 

Citing hi s affi liation with 
"persons of questionable loya lty," 
the FBI asse rted that Kerr may 
have been a member of the 
Comlllunist Party, according to 
FBI records obtained by the 
Chrollicle. 

FBI offIcials in San Francisco, 
who were unaware of Feinstein's 
letter, sa id the agency has 
changed a lot since the 1960s. 

"Clearly the FBI operates 
much differently than it did 30, 
40 years ago," sa id FBI agent 
Andrew Black, a s pokesperson 
for the bureau's San Francisco 
office. 

The FBI's Washington, D.C. , 
headqua rte rs cou ld not be 
reached for comment . 

Retirement is defined by a 
be nefit program set by a for-
mula that looks at an employ-
ee's service credit, age factor 
and highest average salary over 
a 36-month consecutive period 
of employment. 

UC employees are eligible to 
retire at age 50. UCSD employs 
a total of 16,000 employees. 

J ackie Edwards, benefits 
manage r for campus human 
resources at UCSD, said par-
ti cipation in the retirement 
package is advantageous. 

"Actually, there's a great 
advantage," she sa id . "This 
mo ney that is 3cmally set aside 
earns interest to su pplement 
retirement income." 

Ed wards also said there is 
no ri sk to the earnings o f the 
money. 

" If you were to invest it in a 
pr ivate stock option, you don't 
know if it will increase or 
shrink," she said. 

Should an employee leave 
the university, the money can 
roll over to another employer's 
account, or the employee can 
take the money at retirement as 
a su pplement to basic retire-
ment income, according to 
Edwards.

Hearing: Panel investigating 
further provisions at campuses 

continued from page 3 
Srudents seeking services previ-
0us�y had to go through the activi -
ty coordinators, who were often 
unable to arrange for the appropri -
ate services. 

Along with the policy changes, 
a two-person panel is evaluating 
the campuses to determine 
whether further provisions need to 
be made to accommodate hearing-
impaired students. 

Arnie Lerner, one of the panel 
members, described his role on the 
panel as a "mediator." 

"We're going to make recom -
mendations, and then both sides 
can decide whether they wam to 
accept them or not," Lerner said. 
"They probably will ." 

UC officials said the settlement 
is a good thing for heari ng-
impaired sruden ts, adding to a pro-
gram that is already ·more lhan 
adequate. 

"The settlement will he lp to 
improve the services for [the l deaf 
and hard of hearing," said UC 
attorney Jeff Blair. "But J also 
believe that the services provi ded 
by both ca mpuses before [he set-
tlement were ones t11at citizens of 
the state of California woul d be

12 HIATUS THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY. NOVEMBER 21. 2002 

British heartthrob and secret agent Bond will 'Die Another Day' 
Big action sequences and B-rated acting are 
trademarks of another formulaic Bond film 

By BILLY GIL 
Staff Writer 

James Bond is back, and this time he has loosened up a bit. He has also brought along some friends. 
Dame Judi Dench and John Cleese 
rerurn in their previous role as M 
and Q, repectively, Halle Berry plays 
the new Bond babe, and plenty of 
new faces pop lip in a plot that 
revolves around diamonds, 0 A 
and death rays. 

Got all that? It doesn't matter. 
"Fun" IS the operative word here, 
and keeping track of exactly why 
130nd has to go co Korea, Cuba or 
Iceland is secondary to enjoying the 
film as it is . Once logic is thrown out, 
wa tching forced love stories and cars 
repeatedly crash through walls 
becomes much more gratifYing. 

Fans of thc serics should be 
pleased to know that the prerequi-
si te sex. chase scenes and explo-
si ons have all been set co maxi-
mum level. Refere nces to old 
Bo nd movies also are freque nt and

unobtrusive, such as Berry's emer-
gence from the ocean, evocative of 
Ursula And ress' Honey Ryd er 
character in the first Bond film, 
"Dr. No." Cleese 's hilarious Q 
also shows up with some good ies 
from the past, namely the jet pack 
and kni fe shoes. 

Pierce Brosnan, who reprises 
his role as J ames Bond for the 
fourth time, seems completely 
comfortable in 007's shoes . He 
obviously takes the role very seri-
ously and spends less time giving 
" Damn I'm smooth" stares in 
fa vor of actually acting. In perhaps 
one of those most demanding 
Bond roles, Brosnan must both 
show the desperation of a tortured 
man and Spout cheesy one-liners 
with equal ease.

'Emperor's Club' is 'Dead 
Poet Society' knock-off 
When studio executives are desperate for 

money they recycle, rehash and reproduce 
By ADAM KELEMAN 

Contributing Writer 

Morality can be thought of as the right or proper way a per-son should live one's life. 
"The Emperor's Club" is a test of 
how we conduct our lives in light 
of the expecta tions that are placed 
on a moral world. Ethan Can in 's 
short story, "The Palace Thief," is 
the fra mework of this fil Ill, which 
deals with the true nature of people 
and the journ ey to define morality.

REVIEW 

oped as archetype wi th no true 
depth. These characters ca n never 
truly develop when given a cliched 
teenager rol e, as seen when the 
young Sedgewick Buck (E mile 
Hirsch) cheats in a trivia game. 
This distinct role as the rebel will 
never release him from predictable 
stunts and a formulai c plot. 

Officer on duty: Day-Day (Mike Epps) abuses his ~sition of authority as he assaults three women in ' Friday After Next:' 
This movie docs not succeed in 

what it sets out to accomplish. It is 
more a meditation on manipulation 
and cliche than a compelling tale of 
virtue. "The Emperor's Club" 
demonstrates the injustice of dra-
matic movies today: the manipula-
tion of the audience. The audience 
is driven to laugh or gasp at the 
slightest substandard plot twist, 
which is bewildering. There is no 
compassion in "The Emperor's 
Club" - only the illusion that 
morality exists, perpetuated by the 
professor's teachings and actions. 

Kline's portrayal of the rousing 
professor is the backbone of "The 
Emperor's C lub." The passion that 
exudes from his demeanor and pres-
ence is a fonnidable performance, 
which is complemented by Emile 
Hirsch, who resembles Leonardo 
DiCaprio in his early days. 

'Friday' is ba~k to back old tricks 
'Friday' fans will lap up the third installment of Ice Cube's comedy 

By JESSICA KRUSKAMP 
Senior Staff Writer 

Expect Santa to rob you blind on Christmas Eve when 
"Friday After Next" rolls 

around. In Ice Cube's fantastical 
Friday world, even the jolliest of 
men is a holiday-in-the-ghetto 
nightmare. 

The third chapter of the 
"Friday" series finds Craig (Ice 
Cube) having fl own the coop. He's 
pulled himself up by his bootstraps 
and rented a bachelor's pad with his 
cousin, Day-Day (Mike Epps). The 
two are so grown up that their pad 
even has Yuleti de cheer during the 
holidays. 

Yuletide cheer, however, is 
shattered in a hilariously funny 
sce ne when Santa "The Cat 
Burglar" Clause tiptoes under the 
mistletoe to steal any gifts worth 
taking. When C raig confronts 
Santa, the Christmas tree is a 
weapon in an o pening scene that is 
fraught with swea ring, classic 
insults and below-pa r stage-fight-
ing that sets the tone for the rest 
of the movie. 

·'friday After ex t'· is not 
expenmental , does not push many 
boundanes and is pretty much like 

Film 
REVIEW 

the other "Friday" films . Fans will 
eat this movie up. It is exactly as to 
be expected: toilet humor, women-
with-moustaches humor, old-men-
dancing humor and cops-who-do-
nothing humor. 

Of course, there is a plot. 01' St. 
Nick makes away with the rent 
money, and most of the movie is 
spent trying to get it back -
though Craig and Day-Day never 
seem too concerned about it. Ice 
Cube and E pp could have made 
the threat of eviction more believ-
able. 

Hours to get the rent money in, 
jobs as unarmed security guards 
and a few pimps and hoes make the 
story drift away from its Chrisonas 
Eve theme. The old "Friday" slap-
stick comedy is in full force at all 
times, and only when "Santa" 
makes a sporadi c appearance or 
someone sprays some fake snow on 
a window is the audience relnindecl 
that, yes, tllis is supposed to be a 
holiday trea t. 

Craig, of course, has a love 

interest. Donna (Anna Maria 
Horsford) rerurns his advances, but 
there is one obstacle - a micro-
mini pimp named Money Mike. 
Small in stature and large in 
pimpin' style, Money Mike bosses 
Donna around. 

And Donna, for some reason, 
takes it. 

Maybe she had a momentary 
lapse in consciousness due to 
sequin-blindness from Money 
Mike's robes. Or maybe this is just 
the world of "Friday." In any case, 
she evenrually comes to her senses. 
Just wait until you see whose fami-
ly jewels end up like walnuts in the 
Christmas nutcracker. 

For more than a few cheap 
laughs, several jokes you ca n repeat 
and a good look at ChrismlaS on 
"Friday After ext," see the movie. 
Just go at the cheap matinee time 
- that way you'll be sure to get 
close to your moneys worth.

THURSDAY. NOVEMBER 21. 2002 THE UCSD GUARDIAN HI ATUS 13 

Talented Carlton displays her 
raw talent at Canes with Ben Lee 
The beautiful young genius proves that she's not merely 
another Britney or Christina when she rocks her piano 

By DAVID BYNUM 
Senior Staff Writer 

The H ouse of Blues concert series brought Vanessa Carlton to a newly remodeled Canes venue Nov. 13 . The 
renovations added co the enchanting evening 
with Carl ton and her Aussie opene r, Ben 
Lee. T he audience was 90 percent female, 
and the venue was at 80 percent capacity. [f it 
had been possible to give out these numbers 
before tile show, perhaps a greater male pop-
ulation would have showed and been shocked 
to hear the sultry styling of one of the musi c 
industry's freshest versions of the angered 
prodigal adolescent songstress. 

So why is the most talented of the newest

group of young female songwriters, who has 
been call ed "the answer to Brim ey," playing 
before a partially empty crowd at Canes? 
O ne would have to guess that some of her 
unsold tickets could be chalked up to 
anonymity. Despite appearances on "Total 
Request Live," a good deal of people still 
ca n't tell the difference between Carlton and 
,mists like Avril Lavigne or Michelle Branch. 
In so me illstances, with some artists, this is 
no b'Teat tragedy, but Carlton's talent, which 
ca me through so clearly Nov. 13, deserves 
attention. 

While Carlton probably won 't grace the 
cover of "Teen People," she is a great deal 
more likely to receive a Grammy nomination 
than her counterparts. More interested in 
music than anything el se, Carlto n is rumored 
to have re fused to dance in her mu ic videos; 
surprising for a girl who was accepted into 
the American Academy of Ballet at 14. 

Instead of grouping her in the Branch cat-
egory, think of Carlton as Fiona Apple, 
where she might be right now if she had a 
better piano teacher and a better therapist. 
While Carlton rocked with a full band for a 
good ha lf of the night, she shined most 
brightly when she o nly shared the stage with 
the cand les lit on her piano. Amid her few 
ai rplay songs were a number of slow ballads 
that were commanding enough as piano 
compositions without the addition of what 
ca n only be described as a raw and soaring 
vocal talent. 

This is not to say that Carlton put the 
audience to sleep. In fact, amid somewhat

princess; this girl can actually perform. 
boring tales of her college life before star-
dom, she managed to throw in a Rolling 
Stones cover song. While the audience was 
left to wonder how such beautiful music 
could be inspired by a drunken college boy 
tickling Carlton's thigh after hearing her si ng 
one night, they were not surprised when she 
started one of her final songs with, "I wrote 
this song with tears streaming down Illy 
face." 

The evening's most stirring rendition was 
"Ordinary Day." which displays her vocal tal-
ent better than most of her song, and pro-
vides the li stener with a good survey of 
Carl ton 's own melodic incarna tions. 

The album that she is promoting, "Be 
Not Nobody," has a dark and intelligent side 
that isn't heard by "TRL"-watchers . Whil e 
her radio-friendly songs tend to sound like 
what she referred to at her show as love songs 
written by people who aren 't in love, there is 
a great deal of substance to this Pennsylvania 
native. [t remains to be seen if Carlton will 
follow her predecessors in releasi ng a lack-
luster sophomore album, or continue to 
demand an audi ence until her name is men-
tioned among the greats. Regardless, her 
concert offered an enchanting look at a 
young genius who is still more familiar with 
her heart and the piano than she is with fam e.

Berry isn't quite convincing as Jinx, the 

latest Bond chick . It's OK; it's playtime fo r

squeezing every bit of attirude possibl e out of 
lines like "Ornithologist - that's a mouth-

Denise Ri chards and her vomit-inducing 
performance in the last Bond film (1999's 

"The World is Not Enough"). 
The most welcome surprise is th e effec-

newcomers Rosamund Pike (Miranda Frost)

riously wicked in thei r roles as Bond adver-
saries.

Turn 2 I " (Lookout!

Their l11usic, d combi nation of 
limplc punk rock formula and 
.Iren.l-worthy riff., reminiscent of 

that ghidly forgotten butt-rock 
era, is aboU[ 25 years roo bte. 

At the onset of their main-
~tream popularity, it was sa id that 
they were merelv a fab rication -
the' creation of some big-time pro-
ducers and their mass media 
machinery. But the Donn.ls have 
put 10 th~i r tlme and played their 
share of lI1all clubs and unwcl -
coming audiences. In fact, they 
will he celebrati ng thei r 10th

product of the media. 

However, since signing with 
Atlantic Records, their look has 
begun to shift toward that ever-
familiar glossy image that one can 
find splashed across the vaSUless of 
mai nstream music. It's starting to 
look as if, despite their punk rock 
roots, their new sexy persona will 
lead them into pop star territory to 
cohabitate with a mob of boy 
bands and girl groups. 

But the Donnas seem to be 
artempting to maintain some sem-

Radio Radio; 
could it be 

worth listening 
to again? 

don't pop

Rinaldo Dorman 

Who knew that radio-ti-i enclly rock could still kick out the jams? The indie rock-mind-
ed influence that is bubbling up 
past the tainted sugar-pop oil slick 
that sits on the surface of dominant 
media is enough to catch the ears 
of all but the most hardened and 
cynical ... well . at least of those who 
listen to rock music, I suppose. 

['m certainly not implying th'lt 
radio has somehow overcome all 
the negative aspects that have dri-
ven listeners into the undergrou nd 
for fresh sounds, but we have - for 
the moment - an exciting devel-
opment: lnteresting ha~ds arc 
being played on the radi o. 

You know what's honestir !,(ot

time they sti nk of .In overt attempt 
to protit' from the rcputation~ the)' 
werc forced ro ea rn while still 
working for a living. But nonethe-
less, [ am forced to admit I've been 
cranking up my tape deck/receiver 
whenever I hear the song from 
AudiosJave, "Cochise." 

Three-fourths of Rage Aga inst 
the Machine and one part of 
Sound garden have combined in a 
surprisingly vibrant fashi on (oka y, 
so Chris Cornell was a solo artist 
after Soundgard cn, but still ). 
Somehow, they manage to ret,un 
the best elements from both previ-
ous bands, in as much as could be 
brought over by the availa l,l e 
members. Tim Commford (bass) 
and Brad Wilk (drums) lay down a 
precise and driving rhythm section, 
while Tom Morello continues to 
work his guitar like a freaked-out 
DJ, and Cornell (vocals) gives the 
aggressive punch that is absent in 
his acoustic solo work. These parts 
- the band's simple yet experi-
mental rock and the singer 's 
aggressive edge - work seamlessly. 
They form a unity that can be 
appreciated on its own terms, and 
not as a novelty oHormer greatness 
- a gripe of mine that can be 
heard often in not-so-supergroups. 
Take MD45: Lee Ving (vocals/gui-
tar in Fear) and Dave Mustaine 
(vocals/guitar in Megadeth) are a 
prime lesson in why these things 
tank so often. 

"Cochise" is titled after the 
someone whom Morello credits as 
the last Native-American chief to 
die free and "absolutely" uncon-
quered, which he cites as bei ng 
representative of the song. Cochise 
the historical figure lost severn I 
family members when the U.S. cal -
vary captured, tortured and hanged 
them. Su bsequently, "Cochise the 
Avenger, fearless and resolute , 
attacked everything in his path 
with an unbridled fury. This song 
kind of sounds like that," Morella 
is quoted as saying on 
h up ://ubl.llrtistdirect. com/. 

All this after Cornell stated in 
Rolling Stone that he wouldn't 
write political lyrics. Oh well. The 
avant-garde leftism (or cOlllmie-
pinko-ism to you Republicans) of 
Rage Against the Machine was one 
of its strong points, offering a 
breath of political fresh air in an

Bazan of Pedro the Lion will play 
at The Casbah, where he will 
make a crowd of devoted fans 
and strangers fall in love with his 
humble manners and quirky 
sense of humor. The show will 
start at 8:30 p.m. and tickets are 
$10. For tickets and information

There is nothing more astonish· 
ing than musical skills that are 
passed down from one generation 
to the next. Extraordinary guitarist 
John Pizzarelli leamed his skills 
from his dad Bucky, who per-
formed with the swing bands of the 
'50s and '60s. Although not as 
skilled a guitarist as his father, his 
charming voice is sure to enchant. 
Seeing a one-of-a-kind show with 
Piuarelli on guitar, his borther 
Martin on bass and Ray Kennedy 
on piano will undoubtedly get you 
your money's worth. They play at 
the Poway Center for the 
Performing Arts at 8 p.m. Tickets 
are $43 to $45.

If you didn't see them last 

time they were touring on the 

West Coast you must be sure not 
to miss them now that they will 
be playing at Canes Bar and Grill. 
The internationally acclaimed 
British duo Zero 7 (Sam Hardaker 
and Henry Binns) is notorious for 
their mature and seductive soul 
and jazz sounds and will most 
likely be toting their group of pro·

Young. innovative and recently 
graduated from college, the 
members of Roots of Orch is are 
now out of school and can devote 
their lives to their music. The 
band that began with strange high 
school kids experimenting with 
synthesizers and drum machines 
has evolved into an invigorating 
band that is continually growing. 
Influenced by jau, post-rock and 
other forms of music, they have 
brought together what they love 
and what they know to make an 
interesting array of music. Check 
them out at the Che Cafe when 
they play with Oma Yang at 8 
p.m. Tickets are $5.

Rappers from Kentucky? An 

oxymoron, you say? They do exist, 
and they're good, too. Nappy 
Roots, the group that formed at 

Westem Kentucky University In 
1995, has been producing great 
rhyming lyrics and soul without 
any of the flashy gold chainS or

Who says disco is passe? Well , 

it's one of the most popular 
events at The Casbah, and there 
are many reasons as to why this 
might be. Perhaps it is the great 
array of music: rock, techno, 
garage, hip-hop and rockabilly. Or 
maybe it's the fact that all the 
people that show up are dance· 
crazy fiends looking for a good 
time. Or maybe it's because 
there's no cover' For whatever 
reason, if you're over 21, be sure 
to get your booty down their

'The Winter's Tale' lives at The Globe 
A cast of young actors bring the Shakespearean classic to dramatic life 

By ANNE CONG-HUYEN 
Associate Hiatus Editor 

Love, jea lousy, betrayal, inno-cence, guilt. All common themes in a typical work of 
Shakespeare, and the latest produc-
tion of"Thc Winter's Tale" playing 
at the Cassius Carter Centre Stage 
in Balboa Park is dripping with 
the 'e emotio ns and ideas, leaving 
nothing to be desired, 

Each year, the Uni versity of San 
Diego Masters of Fi ne Arrs in 
Dramatic Ans program collabo-
rates with the G lobe Theatres to 
present an o riginal theatrical pro-
duction with a young cast of tu-
dents enrolled in the inten ive 
graduate study program. This 
year's production of "The Winter's 
Tale" combines commendable per-
formances and innovative se t 
design to deliver an altogether 
pleasing product. 

ln the small , intimate atmos-
phere of Centre Stage, the audi-
ence is drawn in by dimmed house 
lights into the classical world of 
Sicilia and Bohemia and the drama 
that unfolds there with the overac-
tive imaglllanon of King Leontes. 

\Mth the opening scene. the sus-
picio us looks and solilo'luics of 
Leonres are incredibly evocative and 
no person in thc lIudiencc, no matter 
how dense they are, c:ln mistake his 
thoughts as 1;1" watches his wi fe 
H ermIOne ,md his fj'i end Pol ixenc , 
th e ncighboring king of Bohelilia. 

It is these jealous and w1founded 
;uspicions that act as impetus for the 
action in the pby. Polixenes flees for 
fear of his life. [ Iernlione is impris-
oned, where she gives bi rth to her 
daughter, who is later lost. 
Hernlione is put on trial, at which 
point her innocence is revealed to 

foolish Leontes, but all too late. So 
the remainder of the play tells of 
what becomes of the lost daughter, 
Polixenes and guilty, grievous 
Leontes. 

Although not a very original pro-
duction, the young cast displays 
amazing control of their physical 
capabilities both voca lly and physi-
cally, which results in an engaging 
and exciting performance. The edit-
ing of the ori brinal play is done mas-
terfully enough to leave only wha t is 
pertinent and integral to the action 
and plot of the stOry, which is neces-
sary for young college students with 
short attention spans (not to ay that 
there were young men sleeping in 
the front rows, because there were a 
few of those as well). 

Of the young actors, David 
Raphael D'Agostini as Leontes is 
very talented, if a bit over-dramatic 
(which is permissible since this is 
Shakespeare), but the performance 
of Jeffrey Brick as consci entious 
Camillo is more realistic if you 
ignore his short moments of trem-
bling and discomfort. The sea-
soned ChristOpher Gottschalk (a 
UCSD alumnus) is quite convinc-
ing as the confu ed but stubborn 
Polix.ines. Emmelyn Thayer ;md 
Deborah Annette Heinig as the two 
female leads, Hermione and 
Pauli lu, are very theatrical but pur-
poseful in their performances. 
Heinig was occasionally unrealistic, 
since her character jumped from 
tear ' to screams, not able to main-
tain either. But ovcrall, her role as 
the brokenhearted lady was well 
lelivered. Proba bly one of the 

more natura l performances was 
Rod Broga n as the Old Shepa rd, in 
which his character is su rprisingly 
realistic and humorous. Without 
being forced , he is able to pull off

caring and fearful and then endear-
ing and funny as well , 

The simplistic setting with cam-
ouflage-esque painting and soft 
lights is comfortable and fits cspe-
cially we ll ,vith the latter part of the 
play. The somewhat elaborate cos-
tumcs do not always correspond to 
the simpl e setting, but depict the 
time and place of the play (ancienr 
Greece), The trite music does not 
add to the play except for tl1e two 
dance sequences - one innocent 
and full of gaiety, the other sensuous 
and wild - in which it is the physi -
cal force of tl1e actors that propels 
the scene and not the music. 

Overall, the production is enter-
taining and easy to understand if 
you are willing to Ii ten. \Vith emo-

REVIEW 
Training Program perform won-
derfully. This play has large char -
acters with an array of emutlo n; to 
portray. These character, chal -
lenge thc actors. 

"This acting is some of the hest 
ever seen," Agins sa id, 

T he smeared lipstick and obvi-
ous bra strap is in the not-so-distant 
furure. Brody Armstrong, the 22-
year-old singer and Australian-
native wife of Rancid's Tim 
Armstrong, is a force to be reck-
oned with. She sneers the lyrics of 
their newest album, "Sing Sing 
Death House," and although she 
sounds eerily like Cour01ey Love 
ci rc'1 Hole's 1994 release, "Live 
Through This," The D istillers' 
sound still remains fresh . 

counesy at Ep~aph Records 
Listen here: Armstrong. Andy and Ryan of The Distillers get ready to sing. 

This week, the American drama "Mourning Becomes Electra" by Eugene O'Neill opens as 
the second prod ucti on by the 
UCSD Department of Theatre 
and Dance. Based on Greek 
dramatist Aeschylus'S tri logy, "The 
Oresteia," "Mournin g Becomes 
Electra" looks at the trials of a New 
England family in the aftermath of 
the Civil War. Director Suzanne 
Agins says that one of the reasons 
she chose this play is that it is "a 
great way to retell the Greek myths 
in a way that we can relate to and 
identify with ." 

The actors rise to the challenge 
of the intensity of the production 
and give the viewers the best perlar-
mance possible. 

Armstrong, who was once a 
member of punkers Sourpuss, isn 't 
just a chick with a mic. She is all 
over her guitar, and drives songs 
like "City of Angels" and "Sick of it 
All." 

Ryan, who likes to keep his sur-
name a mystery, is on the bass. TI1e 
man who actually worked at a 
record store a month before meet-
ing The Disti llers is like the princess 
in a punk fairytale. Guy works at 
store, plays a mean bass guitar in 
spare time, hooks up with The 
Distillers .. . and all 's well that ends 
we!l with "Sing Sing Death House." 

Andy, who only u es his first 
l1ame and whose resume lists such 
experience as drummer for the 
Nerve Agents, is more than quali -
fied for this gig. His sound, coupled 
with Armstrong and Ryan's, is dis-
tillcd bliss. 

"Sing Sing Death House" i the 
second full release from The 

Distillers. Longtime fans wi ll notice 
that Rose, additional vocaHst and 
guitarist off the first album, is MIA. 
]r's just the three D isti!lers now, and 
Brody, Ryan and Andy give no rea-
sons to complain. 

In true on-the-road shenanigans 
fashion, the band has had some 
good times on their national tour. 
The Disti!lers have gone high-tech, 
and addicts (or fans) can get their fix 
any time - the band maintains an 
online diary on their Web site, in 
which they log the craziness about 
being on the road. 

The diary is complete with 
behind-the-scenes info on the par-
ties, on-s tage horro r stories 
(Armstrong unintentiona!ly inde-
cently exposed herself at a recent 
show) and random musings. 

The Distillers bring along some 
luggage ,vith them: Garbage, pro-
moting their newest release in four 
years, "beautifulgarbage," and No 
Doubt, who have shamelessly pro-
moted their album, "Rock Steadv."

Garbage puts on a rather com -

pelling live show due to vocalist 
Shirley Manson, who possesses 
the stage with a powerfu l pres -
ence. She has yelled at screaming 
fans, thrown things at them and 
basically captivated thousands of 
people. Manson also details life on 
the road in a live journal on the 
Garbage Web site. 

o Doubt (who, according to 
Manson's diary, dressed as pirates in 
New Orleans and got a littl e 
liquored up) may seem like excess 
baggage to many - the No Doubt-
Garbage-Disti!lers triad is quite a 
combo. But "Rock Steady" features 
some of the band 's better songs and 
makes for a good show nonetheless.

One of the reasons that the play 
is such a treat for theater patrons is 
that "Mouming Becomes Electra" 
is not often performed. One of the 
main reasons is that, uncut, this play 
runs between six and six-and-a-half 
hours. With such a massive amount 
of material to work through, this 
play is a challenge for both the 
director and the actors involved. 

But not to worry - this pro-
duction will not be anywhere clo e 
to six hours. 

"One of my first tasks was to cut 
it so it runs at a reasonable length," 
Agins said. After cutting as much as 
possible, Agins says that the pro-
duction is "very brisk" and that it 
"plays like a ro ll er coaster, rartling 
along." T llis is a fast-paced pro-
duction that is sure to hl)ld tile 
viewer's attention from the o pen-
ing line to the curtain cal!. 

Another good reason to go see 
th is prod uction is that the actors 
from the Graduate Theatre 

T his is a strong drama that 
grabs the viewer at the very hegin -
ning. T he play's characters cowr a 
range of human e m otions, 
H owever, it is a trageov, so the play 
is largely melodramatic. Bl1t Agim 
said that this play "rips your hean 
alit in the best possible way." 

This is a good chance for stu -
dents to see a 25,OOO-year-old story 
brought into a much more modern 
context. Agins also points Ollt that 
"this is a chance fo r UCSD stu-
dents to see really world class act-
ing. This production grabs you ancl 
doesn 't let you go. It is intcnse, 
moving, devastating ... Everyone 
likes some dcvasta ti on , right ' "

Innovation gives 'Shrew' great new life 
Reversed gender role illuminates Shakespeare's classic comedy 

By KARLA DEVRIES 
Staff Writer 

This definitely ain 't your moth-er's Shakespeare; the Eveoke Dance Theatre's "Taming of 
the Shrew" is Shakespeare with a 
twist. While embracing all the 
humor and bawdy antics that were 
originally intended, director Gina 
Angelique uses gender reversal to 
fulfill her Shakespearean vision. 
Joined by a minimalist set design 
and intimate theater space, Eveoke 
creates a unique theatrical experi-
ence. 

In the show, gender reversal 
doesn't mean that the actors are in 
drag. With just one exception, men 
play men in the women's roles 
while women play women in the 
mens roles, all without changes to 
the text with respect to gender ref-
erences. 

In the Italian city of Padua, 
there are two sisters: the beautiful , 
sweet Bianca, and the saucy shrew 
Kate. Their father won't allow any-
one to court Bianca before the 
elder Kate is married off. The vari-
ous suitors scheme and philander in 
their quest, and in the end true love 
emerges where least expected. 

There are two additional char-
ac ters, Girl and Boy Gender, por-
trayed by dancers Elizabeth Marks 
and Anthony Rodriguez. These 
silent characters open each ection 
of the piece, reflecting the emo-
tional turmoil of the gel~ders 
through modern dance sequences. 
They remain onstage throughout, 
incorporating themselves into the 
scenes. 

The show runs through Dec. 1 
at downtown's Sushi Performance 
& Visual Art facil ity. This informal 
theater is a large, open room with a 
stage space in the center, surround-
ed by plastic chairs that are thank-
fully more comfortable than they 
appear. All the actors remain in the 
room throughout the performance 
lined up along the back wall behind 
the stage. Since the audience is 
always able to see the performers, 
they continue acting even while 
offstage. This gives the show a 
multidimensional aspect, si nce 
those offs tage playoff the action 
onstage. 

To emphasize the text of the 
play, very few design elements are 
used. Aside from a few smaller 
props, the only sets are two bench-
es that are moved to represent fur-
niture, walls and other objects. Al l 
the actors are dressed in similar 
costumes, with the women in dress-
es and the men in slacks, accented 
by individual elements. 

Due to this conservative set, the 
ac tors are forced to rely on the text 
itself. T he cast members make 
amazing use of their entire bod ies 
to evoke the sentiments of those 
words . Run ning the gamut from 
rage to playful innuendo, the actors 
charge the tiny space with emotion. 

Liv Kellgren 's portrayal of 
Petruchio is daring and well-exe-
cuted. The statuesque actress tow-
ers over lim Wild as Kate, which 
creates a physical gender reversal 
that further emphasizes the new 
roles. Kellgren's wild characteriza-
tion is both funny and intimidating, 
allowing for a new outlook on a 

Theater 
REVIEW 

very chauvinistic character. 
The show's lesser characters are 

also very entertall1ll1g. Most 
notably, Wendy Waddell as Tranio , 
the servan t who is posi ng as a 
nobleman, evokes hilarious body 
language and attitude that illumi-
nates the minor role. 

"Taming of the Shrew" is one of 
ma ny varia tions on the 
Shakespearean classic, but Eveoke's 
cast makes this one shine. The pro-
duction is both interesti ng and 
hilarious in its manipulation of 
gender stereotypes. Even the Bard 
himself would be amused. The 
show is curently running through 
Dec. I. Show times are Thursday 
through Saturday at 8 p.m. and 
Sunday at 7 p.m. Tickets are $12 
for students and seniors and $18 for 
adults under 65 . Thursdays and 
Sundays are "Pay What You Can" 
nights. Tickets can be purchased at 
the box office one hour before the 
show. For more information, call

Provocative new exhibit defies norms 
Unique cut-and-paste art forms combine the urbane with the strange 

By LISA MAK 
Staff Writer 

The Sushi Performance & Visual Art facility has been presenting the "Syzyrgy" art 
exhibi tion as a part of Its 2002-03 
Visual ArtS season. The exhibition 
will be shown until Dec. 14. 

"Syzyrgy" showcases the work 
of three innovative artists -
Ma tthew Forderer, Juli a Wren and 
;vlichael Svalbery - who crea te 
thei r pieces using unlikely sources 
and materials. T he word "syzyrgy" 
itself is a combination of the word 
"syzygy" and "scissors," emphasiz-
ing the Idea of cutting things up 
and reassembling them in uflique 
ways. 

"The main interest in displaying 
these three artists together was the 
way they dealt with materials in a 
cut-and-paste fa hion," said 
Carlson Hatton, who is responsible 
for putting the exhibit together. 

The abstract and sometimes 
bizarre work in "Syzyrgy" will 
Imlke you view art ifl an entirely 
new light. Forderer is presenting 
his "meat series," a collection of 
collages that combine images of 

meat packing and vaudeville per-
formances. His images, such as one 
where cowboys stand off against 
racks of hanging beef, create an 
awareness of the sense of absurdity 
in the world. 

The work of Wren , a young 
artist who recently returned to San 
Diego from shows in Los Angeles 
and the Bay Area, consists of mixed 
media pieces that merge the inter-
nal and the external senses. Wren's 
current series on display consists of 
old photographs sewn OntO paper, 
creating rich images of history and 
memory. 

Svalberg's sculptures explore 
how common objects like fuel tanks 
and fur collars can be transformed 
when combined. T hrough his com-
binations, Svalberg gives new life 
and meaning to objects that seem 
to have artistic value. 

During the selection process for 
the visua l arts season, Sushi looks 
for new, innovative and experimen-
tal work from emerging and mid-
career artists in Southern 
California. It seeks a diversity of 
cultural and personal backgrounds 
in its presentation of provocative 
modern art. 

"Sushi is a very active space," 
Hatton said . "There have been a lot

Bond: Explosions and skin will draw fans 
continued from page I) 

tion, culminating in a bedroom 
adorned with swans that looks like 
it was decorated by Prince and 
Bjork. 

The character of Graves is also 
successful as Bond's foil, with 
Stephens displaying his Guy Pearce-
like demonic grin. These two rising 
stars largely contribute to the success 
of the film . If the world is a fair 
place, much more of them will be 
een in the near future. 

The problem with including so 
much action and so many characters 
is that the film runs a bit long. Even 
wi th a running time of over twO 
hours, characters like Rick Yunes 
scarfaced villain, Zao, and Samantha 
Bond's hilarious Miss Monneypenny 
feel underused. Still, this is obvious-
ly an action movie, not a character 
film, and Bond's cool car chases, 
sword fights and surf scenes make up 
for plot holes and flat characters. 
Sporting both a cool new song and a 

laughably bad cameo by Madonna , 
this promises to be one of the most 
entertaining action movies released 
this year.

THURSDAY, NOVEMBER ZI, Z002 

Indie: Clear 
Channel 

rebels show 
up on the air 

conlinued from page 14 
otherwise raunchy and chauviflistic 
music industry. Morello, actually 
not frothing at the mouth like some 
bleeding hearts, has stated that he 
is willing to divert his political 
attentions to other avenues and 
focus this grou p more on the 
music. 

Not all is well , though, so don't 
go accusing me of overly glowing 
about a dreaded "major label" 
release. The video is "m 'eh " at best; 
The band rolls up in a vehicle, rush-
es into an elevator and then begins 
to gyrate in front of fireworks atop 
some construction site. Not too 
interesting really, considering one 
would expect something more 
exciting and original. And then 
there are the rumors about some of 
the tracks being done with rapper 
DMX, which JUSt doesn't sound like 
anything worth listening to. 

taying with a positive radio vibe, 
I I1lrn to a subject thar is much clos-
er t home; the de-corporatization 
of San Diego radio. T here are two 
full-ti me, widelv accessible stations 
that have COIlt~ away from Clear 
Channel s i\lana-e que monopoly of 
nearl y evel)' mainstream station ill 
San Diego; 92. 1 and 94.9. 

The selection on 92. 1 is a sur-
prising mix of very good semi-pop-
ular bands who don't get touched 
by the giants and otherwise popula r 
tracks . A look at their playlist is 
telling: Sure , th ere is the new 
Nirvana song alongside U2 and 
Korn, but there are also songs by 
The Distillers, Queens of the Srone 
Age, Flogging Molly, Jason Mraz 
alld even the Flaming Lips 
(bttp://www.mdepel1df1lt.fm l). Of 
course, they do play "Cochise." 

The most recent sta tion to turn 
its back on being separated on ly by 
its call numbers fro m a hundred 
similar stations around the country 
is 94.9. Considering how recent its 
change of format was, it is conse-
quently less fleshed out than 92.1 . 
Its personality is sti ll a little bare, 
and there are evidently fewer DJs 
then normal. Mostly they seem 
concerned with beating into the . 
ground the fact that they are not a 
Clear Channel station and are actu-
ally run by on-site DJs. Other then 
that, their claim is to form a San 
Diego-specific sta tion. There is 
some bamer about "adult alterna-
tive," which is about as loaded a 
statement as I have heard from the 
biz. Only time wi ll tell what this 
will grow into, but my vote is 
against making it all surfer/skater 
songs (another 91 X clone). 

(Secretly, I wi II miss the loss of 
all '80s all the time, but - shhh -
no one can know.) 

Along with a variety of smaller 
access stations, including the Web-
oriented likes of our own KSDT 
(http ;llsr:w.tlcsd.tdul), there are 
interesting asides from the regular 
run-of-the-mill stations like Free 
Radio 96.9 
(bttp;//W1ITW.pirate969.orgl), a pirate 
station that is only broadcasting Ofl 
Sundays from 6 p.m. until mid-
night. 

If your tastes run into the dar-
ing, then you might wam to go out 
of your way to check 96.9 out. You 
are hereby given my personal guar-
antee to find unique content over 
all of San Diego's airways. While 
they do ha ve "Ugly Radio," a punk 
program that runs twice during the 
lineup, they also have This Way 
Out, an internationally distributed 
lesbian and gay radio magazine; 
"San Diego Edition," a local news 
program; and "Porch Swing," the 
best in cia ic blues. 

o check out their Web site and 
see if you're in one of the lucky 
locations that can actually receive 
their low-powered transmission .

"OUTER SPACE & INNER SPACE: 
How NEURONS, BRAINS, AND SOCIETIES LEAR N" 
Comments and questions by PROFESSOR EDWI IlUTCIII 'S 

Department of Cognitive Science, UCSD 

How has the Human Race managed to learn so much about the UnIverse ') 
The answer to be explored in this talk looks at the ongoing interactions of 
items that are very small and short-lived-namely, individual hUIl1~n 
brains-wi th something that is decidedly larger and very long-li ved-
namely, the enfotding Tribe, Village, City, or Nati on in whIch each of us 
lives. The dynamical activities at each of these two levels-the II1dlv ldua l 
Brain and the functioning Culture-are each locked 111 a dan~e ut mUlual 
interaction and transfonnation, a dance that sends Humanity on ~ cognitIve 
adventure so far closed to all Olher creatures. And the better we understand 
this Brain/Culture interaction. lhe wIser and safer will our Inescapable 
adventure likely be.

THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 2 t , 2002 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Volleyball: UCSO's energy will play key role 
con untted wm page :;14 

!-l owevet', in last year's region-
al fin al, the "fhron s shocked the 
Covoles. and UCSD eliminated 
th c'm in five g'a mes to move on . 
Tha t match, along with some per-
" mal :lnimmtry, has developed 
into qune a ri v,tlry between 
UCSD and C SB, and should 
the CCAA rivals meet fo r a third 
nme on 10V. 12 at 7:30 p.m. for 
the regional semiti nal , it promises 
to be nc of the hi ghl ights of the 
tournament. 

The Tritons arc a confide nt 
bunch at this point in their sea-
son, having won their past si x 
matc hes, but their on ly three 
defeats are at the hands of 
Western Washington and CSUSB 
- both of whi ch UCSD may 

need to defeat in the regiona l, to 
adv:mce. 

Sopho more outside hitter 
Bonnie Wilson, who led th e 
-rritons in kills this year, will have 
to get a strong start in each of the 
matches if UCSD expects to win; 
her play has been a catalyst all sea-
son. 

As a team, the Tritons must 
pass well to get opportunities for 
middles Katie Hogan and Jennie 
Wil son and to keep the opposi ng 
block confused . Also, energy wili 
be a key factor, since the Tritons 
must shake their occasio n al 
lethargic tendencies and play with 
pass ion to be successful in the 
tournament. 

On the other side of the brack-
e t is sixth -seeded Cal State Los 

Angeles ( t9- 10) - one of th e 
most unpredic ta bl e teams in th e 
dra\\' - in addition to third-seed-
ed Western Washi ngton (23-2) 
and econcl-seeded BYU Hawaii 
(22-~). The Vikings of \tVV\ 'U 
held the tOP spot in the regional 
po ll for most of the second half of 
the year, bllt they were dropped 
from first to third in a puzzling 
switch when the fi nal poil came 
out. 

Two teams will emerge from 
the ir respective sides of the brack-
et for the regional final , which 
will be held Nov. 23 at 7 p.m., 
with the winner standing onl y 
three viCtories away from a 
National Collegiate Ath letic 
Association Divi sion Il national 
championship.

Soccer: Americans begin to watch soccer 
continued from page :14 

The sport appeals to parents as 
well. 

"[Soccer] is very agreeable for 
moms and dads," said UCSD men's 
soccer head coach Derek 
Armstrong. "It is clean and healthy 
and moms want to see their kids 
playa dean sport." 

The growth of professional 
leagues has also contributed to the 
rise of the sport. 

"[Major League Soccer] is 
great for the sport. r t is not at the 
same level as the European 
leagues, but it has improved with 
the younger Americans ," 
McManus said. 

McManus has also been 
impressed with the improvement in 
the quality of players in the United 
States. 

"Now, American players are in 
the English Premier L eague, the 
G erman Bundesli ga and the 
Dutch League. They're bei ng rec-
ogni zed all over the world , and 
people in America are starring to 
know thei r names," McManus 
sa id. 

Armstro ng credits the invention 
of the satellite with adding to the 
popularity of the sport, beca use 
fans "can nuw ee more soccer than 

ever." However, he believes that 
soccer needs to be made more 
accessi ble by putting it on national 
television rather than having to 
turn to Spanish-language channels 
to watch major games. He believes 
that success at the international 
level is also key. 

" There are more Landon 
Donovans in the pipe nne . 

He is definitely not a 
. " uruque case. 

- Derek Annstrong, utsD men's 
soccer head coach 

"It will be very important that 
we win the women's World Cup 
again next year," he said. 

Players believe that the sport 
and its professional leagues, the 
MLS and WUSA, will also have to 
be commercialized and promoted 
to gene rate a mass appeal before it 
will take off. 

"Most of the populariry will 
have to do with publicity and 

advertising," said UCSD forward 
Kristin Jones. 

Armstrong is happy to have wit-
nessed the growth of the sport in 
the United States. He has also been 
actively involved in developing its 
popularity. 

For the past two years, 
Armstrong has been the chairman 
of U.S. Club Soccer, a nonprofit 
organization solely cOlllmitted to 
supporting and developing com-
petitive soccer clubs . The club 
teams will help future elite players 
by allowing them to play other 
teams all over the country. 

Armstrong believes that the 
sport will continue to grow as those 
who play the game now will get 
their children involved in the 
future . In addition, knowledge of 
the sport will continue to spread as 
players become coaches . 

H c is also sure th at there are 
more young stars yet to come who 
will attract attention both at home 
and abroad . 

"There are more Landon 
Donovans in the pipeline. He is 
definitely not a unique case," 
Armstrong sa id. "Everyone in the 
world wants to get a handle on 
future Landon Donovans, so· we 
must be doi ng sOl11ethin)! ri)!ht. "

Women's cross country make first ... 
ever visit to NCAA championships 

Water polo: Depth will be crucial 

UCSD runners will compete in 6K race 
that will include 30 teams on Nov. 23 

By KEITH DO 
S ta ff Writer 

T he UCS D women's cross co untry 
tcam will louk to ma ke waves at its fi rst-
el'er appeara nce at the ati onal 

C(Jll c~iare Athletic As ociation Division II 
Cross' Country Championships on Nov. 
13. 

T he Tritons, coming off a third-place 
team fi ni sh at the NCAA Western 
Regiona l Championships [hat secured 
them the third and fin al national berth in 
the West Region, will send a squad that 
is ranked 18th nationall y to the 
Brookside Golf C ourse in Ashland, 
Ohio. 

Leading the way at the regional cham-
pionships for the women is Audrey Sung, 
who had a third-place finish among 131 
runners with a time of 22 :07 in the 6K 
race - good for her first All -West 
Region Team honor. Following Sung for 
UCSD was Lillian Gardiner (24th), 
Meghan Bellotti (28th), Mimi Hodgins 
(35th), Erin O'Donnell (36th), Lindsay 
Stalker (5 1st) and Kara Cross (60th). 

T he team's qualification came at the 
right time, following a lackluster perfor-
mance at the California Collegiate 
Athleti c Association Championships, 
where it finished fourth despite being the 
third-ranked team in the Western Region, 
which consists of the CCAA, Great 
Northwest Athletic and Pacific We~t 
Conferences. 

The following week, the team dropped 
from No. 4 to No. 6 in the regionaJ poll, 
and from No. 16 in the national poll to

falling out of the top 20. 
The women's 6K race will consist of 30 

teams, including UC Davis and Chico 
State, which finished tirst and second, 
respectively, at the Western Regionals, as 
well as defending champion Western State 
College of Colorado. The 30 teams will 
be representing the eight competing 
regions: West, East, Great Lakes, North 
Central, Northeast, South, South Central 
and Southeast.

"[LMU] beat some very 

good schools we lost to, like 
Pepperdine and Long Beach 
State, during the season," 
Onken said. 

Despite LM U's record 
against some top-ranked 
teams, UCS D managed to 
win both t imes when the 
rivals squared off ea rlier this 
season, and it's clear that the 
Tritons are just as exci ted 
about the third meeting us 
any of the others. 

" 1 wan! to get to the 
championship game and beat 
LM U," sa id senior dr iver 
Kellan Hori . 

In the tourna ment, 
UCSD will continue to uti-
lize the six-for-six substitu-
tion pattern that it has used 
all year. 

"The way we substitute 
should help us in a tourna-
ment situation where we play 
a lot of games in a short 
amount of time," Onken said. 
"By the end of Friday, our 
players will have spent hal f as 
much time in the water as 
other teams." 

UCSD's substitution pat-
tern and depth also helped it 
during the two-week layover 
between games. 

"We practiced really hard 
all of last week, and then we 
had a scrimmage between the 
twO teams with refs and 
everything," Hori said. "The 
intensity level was JUSt as hjgh 
as a normal game." 

Although there are twO 
games to be played on Nov.

Not much 
joy comes 
from the 

bandwagon 
From the 
Front Row 

Bryce Warwick 

T he temperature is in the mid- '80 outside and it 's the mi ddl e o f ovember, 
hur JUSt because " fai r wea ther" 
descrihe Southern California in 
the b ll doesn't me~ n it sho uld 
dcscri be its fa ns. 

I Io nesti y, what is th e deaP 
:-.Jcar ly one' month ago, I suffered 
the hi tter and horrible agony of 
w,nching my G iants lose to the 
Angels in the World Series. T he 
I.ext week, [ saw heads all over 
can:pus adorned in red halo caps, 
every one of them new. Last year 
the An gels had 17 fa ns worldwide, 
and yet after one run through the 
playo ffs, they magically became 
everyone's favorite team. 

Angels' fans did not deserve a 
World Series. I take that back -
those 17 deserved to have their 
team win as much as anyone else. 
T he rest of you need to take those 
hats off. 

And speaking of fai r-weather 
fans, where are all the Lakers flags 
on the cars now? Around playoff 
time last year, everyone and their 
mother flew one of those and loud-
ly proclaimed to be the team's 
biggest fan. Now, wi th the Shaq-
less, hapless wonderboys 3-8 and 
getti ng blown out routinely, I see 
no flags . 

Lakers fl ags aren 't the only ones 
that bother me though. After Sept. 
11 , when patriotism became fash-
ionable, it was nauseating to watch 

. the flags spring up in swift compli-
ance with a fad. What's sad is not 
that people recognized the need to 
bond as a nation, but · that these 
symbols of freedom lasted only as 
long as they were seen as chic. 

I' ll love my country - popular 
or un popular, at peace o r at 
war. I'll love my teams - winning 
or losing, whether my friends do 
or nor. 

Ba ndwagon jumping is like 
playing a game you know you'll 
win every time. T here should be 
no joy in that. 

Last time I checked, the 
America n Dream was to wo rk 
hard and to earn nicer things and 
a better life, bu t that's not the 
Southern Californ ia d ream. T hat 
dream is to win the lottery and to 
waste life away wearing red hats 
when fash ionable and attaching 
the Lakers !lag to th e car during 
the playoffs. 

There's something to be said for 
sticking with a team through the 
good and the bad, and the feeling 
at the top is fa r more fultilling 
when you know what it feels like to 
be at the bottom. 

I have the utmost respect for 
Boston Red Sox fans, Cincinnati 
Bengals fans and Golden State 
Warriors fans. Anyone who will 
stick by perennial losers in hopes of 
one glorious season understands 
exactly what I'm talking about. 

Southern California needs to 
show me something. I need to 
know that not all your loyalties are 
as shallow as Hollywood and that 
you're willing to make an invest-
ment into something less certajn

Making a 
cross 
Soccer fi nally 
makes it to U .5. 

By VALERIE NCi 
Staff Writer 

W eare all fami lia r with the image o f soccer moms driving their chi ldren to practice and cheering 
them on at their ga mes. T hese kids eat, 
sleep and dream soccer. In fact , UCS D 
women 's soccer head coach Bria n McMa nus 
cl aims that the U nited States has the largest 
population of youth playing soccer in the 
worl d. However, the numbers drop off a t 
the college and professional levels, and the 
sport has yet to develop the mass appeal of 
football , baseball or basketball. T hose who 
foll ow the action of both American and 
E uropea n professional leagues passionately 
are most likely involved in the sport them-
selves as either players or coaches. 

All of that may soon change. With the 
success of the U.S. men's and women's 
national teams at the international level in 
recent years, especially at trus year's men's 
World Cup, soccer may one day become a 
major sport in this country. T he sport - or 
"the beautiful game" as it has been called 
around the world - is only just now making 
an impact and increasing its fan base in the 
United States, despite its long history as the 
world 's most popular sport. 

T he rise of the women's game in the 
Unjted States began after it won the 1996 
Olympics an'd the 1999 women's World Cup. 
Americans gained a sudden interest in their 
men's team last summer during its successful 
World Cup campaign. Trus was evidenced by 
the 3.8 milljon homes watching the quarter-

final game ~tween the United States and 
Germany on ESPN, which was the largest 
soccer audience ever on the network. 

Young stars such as Landon Donovan and 
DaMarcus Beasley made headlines and 
became increasingly visible in the aftermath. 
Other international soccer powers also 
began to take American soccer seriously after 
years of doubting its teams' ability to play 
the game. As a result of the increasing popu-
larity, there are now more players, fans, tick-
et sales and television viewers of soccer than 
ever in the U.S. 

Soccer enthusiasts are glad to see that 
their sport is finally gajning momentum. 

"Most people had never really heard 
about it until the World Cup," said UCSD 
rrudfielder Molly Carlson. 

Other members of the women's soccer 
team agreed.

Fourth,seeded women's volleyball to 
play in Pacific Regionals over weekend 
Wmner of six-team tournament hosted by 
top-seeded CSUB advances to Elite Eight 

By BRYCE WARWICK 
Staff Writer 

As the UCSD women's volleyball team 
looks toward this weekend 's Pacific Regional 
in San Bernardino, Calif., familiar foes loom 
in the distance, standing between the Tritons 
and a second-consecutive trip to the Elite 
Eight. 

T his year's Pacific Regional is the toughest '. 
of the eight national regions, with five of the 
six competing teams ranked in the top 25 
nationally, and four of those tearns being in 
the top 10. 

Fourth-seeded UCSD (25-4) will open 
play Nov. 21 at 7:30 p.m. against the fifth 
seed and only nationally unranked team of 
the Pacific Regionals, Chamjnade of Hawaii . 
The Silverswords have compiled a 15-7 
record over the course of the year and 
received a berth into the tournament despite 
their third-place fin ish in the Pacific West 
Conference. 

T he winner of the UCSD-Chaminade 
match will take on host Cal State San 
Bernardino (28-2). The Tritons finished sec-
ond to the Coyotes in the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association by one game 
dus year, and CSUSB swept both UCSD

The setup: If UCSD opens the Pacific Regionals

game more. It is also becom-
ing more available to people 
and they are noticing that it 's 
an enjoyable sport," said 
Carlson's teammate, Lauren Jacobs. 

However, the road to popularity has not 
been easy. Trus has been due in part to the 
lack of positive media attention. 

"Rather than try to understand the sport, 
they either put it down or ignored it ," 
McManus sajd. 

Despite the ridicule the sport has 
received, soccer is still a popular recreation-
al activity, especially for young people. The 
nature of the sport makes it an attractive 
choice for athletes. 

"It's a group sport that a lot of people can 
play together," Carlson said. "You can play it 
when you're ymmg or old."

Water polo looks 
for revenge as 
host of toumey 

By OWEN MAIN 
Associate Sports Editor 

The UCSD men's water polo team will 
host and compete in the 2002 Western 
Water Polo Association Championships at 
Canyonview Pool on Nov. 22 and Nov. 23. 
The winner of the eight-team tournament 
will go on to play in the National Collegiate 
Athletic Association Championships Dec. 7 
through Dec. 8 in Los Angeles. 

UCSD ended the regular season losing 
three out of four games to schools from the 
tough Mountajn Pacific Sports Federation. 
However, the 12-time WWPA Conference 
Champion Tritons have had two weeks to 
regroup and get ready for their postseason. 

Last season, UCSD lost to Loyola 
Marymount University in the WWPA 
Championships, wruch were .held on the 
LMU campus. Ths year, the Tritons are 
looking to return the favor. 

"We want some revenge for last year," 
said senior goalie Lance Onken, who has 
given up just under six goals per game this 
season. "We feel like we're the best team in 
our conference and the team to beat." 

But UCSD knows that teams like LMU 
won't be a pushover. .
