Parking 
Shortage 
Assessed 

A UCSD parking committee 
ha decided to support a new set 
of recommendation regarding the 
lack of student parking at the 
Pepper Canyon apartments. 

The Parking and Transporta-
tion Alternative Advisory Com-
mittee decided to upport a sub-
committee's recommendation at 
a meeting held on Tuesday. 

Peter Messrobilln/ Guardian 

The committee's recommenda-
tions, which will be forwarded to 
Vice Chancellor of Bu ines Af-
fairs Steven Reylea's office to be 
considered, include recommenda-
tions to modify campus shuttle 
routes to encircle more of the 
campu , add student parking 
pace to parking lot 406 by the 

Fifth College dorm and Pepper 
Canyon apartments; and to sup-
ply temporary additional parking 
in lot 503 by the Warren apart-
ments. 

Members of the UCSD Parking and Transportation Alternative Advisory Committee met Tuesday and 
decided to support a subcommittee's recommendation on how to deal with student parking shortages. 

According to a urvey ordered 
by the su bcommittee, lot 503 is 
being utilized at 37 percent of its 
operating capacity. 

The Advisory Committee has 
pas ed a subcommittee's sugge -
tion to temporarily reconfigure 
the lot to " upply additional stu-
dent parking in thi nea rly empty 
lot until academic building are 

completed and [Central] library 
expan ion i begun," according to 
the language of the subcommit-
tee's proposal. 

Lurrently there are 128 faculty 
space , 78 0f which are con i t-
entlyempty,and 146 staff spaces, 
97 of which are empty in lot 503, 
accord ing to the urvey. The com-
mittee will recommend that the 
lot be reconfigured 0 that there

In addition, it is being recom-

mended that 118 staff spaces in 
lot 406 by the Fifth dorm be con-
verted to tudent space to meet 
the need for student parking in 
the an'a . 

Doug Willen , a repre entative 
from the Graduate tudent A 0-
ciation, maintained that he wa in 
"vociferous opposition to the 10 s 
of [graduate] spaces in lot 406" 
because graduate tudent and 
staff pay more for their permit 
and therefore, they hould be 
entitled to closer parking. 

He also argued that graduate 
students'irregular chedule render 
their attempts to park in tudent 

pace futile . 
Proponents of the additional 

student pace in lot 406 argued 
student who use the biomedical 
library and other facilities at night 
would have to walk if no parking 
wa a ailable and would face the 
afet hazard of walking alone in 

the dark. 
One committee member point-

ed out that "the problem on this 
campu i not parking ... it' con-
venience parking."

haping of shuttle route to form

I n a move to provide more 
direct support for its re earcher , 
Scripps Institut ion of Oceanog-

which ha previously been sup-
ported by government money. 

The program, announced on 
Feb. 13, is de igned to make the

re earcher , according to A so-
ciate Director of Administration 
Tom Collins. 

" We are hoping that thi [new 
policy] will make [ cripp] more 
attractive for the be t cientist to 
come here," Collin said . 

" I think the idea behind the pol-
icy change was to give all re-
earcher more of a ay in how 
cripp is run," Robert tewart, a 

Scripps researcher and member 
of the policy council that gener-
ated the new policy, aid . 

"U nder the new policy," te-
wart explained , "when [an 
a istant researcher or as ociate

mu t now be fund available

"I think thi makes more peo-
ple feel that they now have a part

different field of study," Ste-
wart continued.

Yacor AI'pert , a well-known 
physicist from the Soviet Union, 
delivered the fir t of two free 
eminar ye terday, which he 

had agreed to provide in excha nge 
for a three-week vi it at UCSD 
which began Feb. 13. 

Al'pert was invited to be a 
Regents Lecturer by both U LA 
and UCSD and has ju t pent 
three weeks at the Los Angele 
campu. 

An expert in the fields of plasma 
physic, the iono phere and radio 
wave propagation , AI'pert ha 
written 17 book as a re ult of hi 
work. 

Al'pert, ague ·t fthe Ie trical 
and omputer ngineering De-
partment, was originall invited 
to U SD in the 1970 ' by the late 
engineering profe r and founder 
of the • Department, Henry 
Booker, wh had kn wn Al'pert 

through hi work. 
However, Al'pert wa unable 

to accept this offer, a he wa not 
permitted to leave the oviet 
Union. 

According to Jim Arnold, a 
Cal Space engineer and colleague 
of Booker and Al'pert, Al'pert 
had been tryi ng to leave the Soviet 
Union ince 1968. 

In 1975, Al'pert applied for a 
i a to leave Ru sia for I rael, but 

was con equently removed from 
his posi tions of re pon ibility, re-
a signed to a relatively minor 
po t, excluded from cientific 
committee, and wa subjected to 
re t rictions on hi cientific activi-
ties . 

Booker renewed his letter of 
in itation to AI'pert in 1979 
through Arnold, who was i iting 
the 0 iet nion at the time. 

Although AI'pert wa ' till un-
able to accept the invitati n , he 
and Booker kept in touch while 
Arpert ontinued in hi a ttempt 
to leave the , oviet nion. 

At the age of76, Al'pert and hi 
wife vetlana were granted per-
manent permis ion to leave Ru -
ia late in 1987. 

" He had to break into the sy -
tem, against odds that would def-
initely [ha e prevented] me from 
tryi ng to leave the oviet nion," 
Arnold aid. 

After his departure from Mo -
cow, Al'pert pent some time at 

t. John's college in Cambridge, 
England before coming to the 
United tate where he ha been 
doing re 'earch a t the mith on-
ian Institutional A trophy ical

U CSB Offers New Sociology Class to 
Cover the History of the UC System 

SA TA BARBARA - UCSB freshpersons will 
encounter a new class spring quarter. 

Sociology 10. ent itled, "Introduction to the Univer-
sity," was developed to introduce freshpersons to cam-
pus life more completely than pos ible during UCSB's 
summer and Orientation Week presentations. 

The fou r-unit course will examine the history and 
function of the UC system and the UCSB campus and 
will include lectures and panel discussions focusing on 
issues such as affirmative action , racism, sexism and 
homophobia. 

The course is the /irst of its kind in the UC system, 
and i unique in its format, compared to other schools, 
according to Brian Schirn, a sociology teaching 
assistant. 

Schirn hopes the fact that Soc. IO does not fulfill a 
General Education requirement will not deter students 
from enrolling in the course, and hopes the class will 
become a standard course for freshpersons. The course

UC Berkeley Professor Suing St. Louis 
Paper for Misquotations in Article 

BERKELEY - Accusing a St. Louis newspaper of 
falsely attributing an "anti-black" opinion piece to him, 
UC Berkeley sociology Professor Harry Edwards is 
suing the paper for $1.2 million in damages. 

Edwards, who also works as a consultant to the 
San Francisco 4gers and major league basebalf Com-
missioner Peter Ueberroth, filed the suit in response to 
a column that appeared in the Jan. 4. 1988 issue of the 
Sf. Louis POSf Dispatch. 

In the lawsuit , Edwards claims that he was mi -
quoted by sportswriter Tom Wheatley, who intervied 
Edwards in July 1987 for an article on Edwards' work 
as a sports sociologist but used the interview for an 
opinion piece under the byline of Harry Edwards. 

The article contained statements "attributing respon-
sibility for the condition of blacks in America to 
blacks" according to the lawsuit. 

In the law uit, Edwards claims the article has dam-
aged his reputation within the black community and 
that he has lost income from speaking engagements as 
well. 

UCSB Students Will Vote in Spring to 
Finance Student Center Expansion 

SANTA BARBARA - Due to perceived over-
crowding in the University Center and a lack of ade-
quate recreational facilities, students will be asked in 
UCSB's Associated tudents spring quarter general 
election to approve a $14 million increase in student 
fees to be used in the expansion of the UCen (UCSB 
Univerisity Center) and the creation of a new recrea-
tional center. 

The project will cost nearly $26 million, $14,307,000 
of which would be financed by students through the 
self-imposed fee increase, according to Everett Kirke-
lie , acting vice chancellor of student services at UCSB. 

If the fee referendum passes, student payment of 
the two building project would begin as early as fall 
quarter 1989 in order to beat inflation and rising con-
struction costs. 

The four-year payment plan would begin with a $12 
quarterly fee , increasing annually to $19 by the second 
year, to $23 by the third year and $33 by the fourth 
and final year. The new Recreation Center would be 
completed by the third year and the UCer. additions 
by the fourth year. 

Although orne students are he itant about the 
proposal because they will graduate before the com-
pletion of the RecCen and the UCen additions, Rec-
Cen representative Jared Tausig assured that if the fee 
referendum passes, revenues from the first quarterly 
fee increase would be put to use immediately. Field 
lights would be installed in one spot on campus within 
18 months.

Personnel at the associate

UCSD Revenue at $685 Million for '88; 
Ranks 10th in Nation for Research Funds

Report Provides Insight Into Income, Expenditures 
By SUSAN E. HYLEN 
Staff Writer 

UCSD generated $685 million 
in revenues last year, according to 
a recently released campus finan-
cial report. 

The largest proportion of these 
funds came from the California 
State government which granted 
$197 million. The UCSD Medical 
Center genera ted $170 million and 
$157 million came from the fed-
eral government. 

Student tuition and fees ac-
counted for $38 million, accord-
ing to t he report. 

UCSD now ranks fifth among 
the nation's universities in federal 
grants received for research and 

lion for janitorial services . 
Grounds maintenance used an 
additional $2 million. 

The greatest percentage increase 
in UCSD's spending was for in-
struction, which grew from $77 
million in 1984 to $134 million 
1988. 

During this time, undergradu-
ate student enrollment went up 22 
percent, from 11 ,122 to 13,589. 

University officials expect total 
enrollment to increase to over 
26,000 by the year 2010. 

The report estimated that the 
university channelled over $1 bil-
lion into the national economy, 
including $660 million in San 
Diego during the 1987-88 fiscal 

year. 
The number of jobs the univer-

sity supports locally and nation-
wide increased by over 50 percent 
to 33,000 and 56,000 respectively. 

UCSD has also been a catalyst 
in the formation of 28 biomedi-
cal, computer, and electronics 
companies in the San Diego area, 
according to the report . 

The value ofthe land, buildings 
and improvements, equipment, 
libraries, and collections is esti-
mated to be in excess of $900 
million. 

At the end of the fiscal year, the 
value of capital improvements 
under construction was estimated 
at $482 million, according to the

UCLA Will Not Support 
Gay Housing Proposal 
By NAOMI RENEK 
Co ntributing Writer. Daily Bruin 

UCLA - The UCLA housing 
administration does not support 
a UC Berkeley proposal giving 
same-sex couples access to family 
student housing units. 

Students at UC Berkeley deve-
loped the Domestic Partnership 
Proposal in ovember to "extend 
the benefits of Family Housing to 
same-sex couples who, under Cal-
ifornia law, are not able to marry. II 

UCLA Director of Bu iness

tion Michael Foraker said , "We 

would want very much to stay 
with existing guidelines." 

To be eligible for family hous-
ing, couples must havea marriage 
license which is recognized by the 
State of California , he said. 

The proposal argues that the 
current family housing policy vio-
lates the UC Regents' non-<lis-
crimination clause which states 
that the University does not dis-
criminate on the basis of sexual 
orientation. 

According to the proposal,

Edilor S nOll': This colllllln is cOil/iI/lied frolll last Thursday. 

O N TH E WA Y out of town the car radio aid it was 4.)0 below zero in Butte, Montana, on Groundhog Day, \\ hich meant 13 
more week of winter and deep snow in the Rockie until June 

... It was hideou news, but my fiancee was laughing wickedly. 
"Perfect,"she exclaimed. "The perfect honeymoon - snowed in for 

13 traight week ." . 
I drove for awhile and aid nothing, just feeling her breathlOg and 

jabbering and vibrating like a strange instrument against m ribs as she 
curled up next to me and punched in a savage Warren Zevon tape 
"Mone , Guns & Lawyer" - an old tune, mean and crazy, but 
omehow it wa right ... I felt fine . 

h wa a good day to be driving fast and happy, booming up the 
mountain in a hot rod Chevy with a beau tiful girl wrapped around me 
and headed for some all-night marriage parlor in Reno. 

Earlier that morning, I wa ju t another mean drifter peedingacross 
the Bay Bridge in a flashy car with a brown bag full of hun?red-dollar 
bills ... Heading east and over the hump to Colorado, fleelOg the cIty 
and definitely not looking for anything stra nge . . . then I'd stopped for 
lunch and wandered straight through t he looking glass. It was free-fall 
now, like one of those sudden Acid Flashbacks that they've been 

WOmiSing us all these years. E WERE ALMOST to Loomis when Jilly remembered that she had left her purse back at the bar in acramento. 
"Goddammit. "she moaned . "We'll have to go back for it. We 

have to turn around." 
"Forget the pur e," ( said . "( have plenty of money." ( reached 

under the seat and grabbed a fistful of hundreds out of the rumpled 
lunch bag. " Look at thi ." I aid . "We're richer than Judas." 

She hook her head . ", 0 , I need my 10," she said. "You can't get 
married in Reno without 10." 

So what? J thought. From what she'd told me about her boyfriend, I 
figured he would have his people after us by now - maybe even the 
Highway Patrol for kidnapping. 

I had understood from the ~tart that J had some kind of bomb on my 
hands ... It was not like I'd picked up a hitch-hiker. 

No this was a very expensive woman ' and I had , in fact , grabbed her 
out of a downtown pOlitical bar at lunchtime and run awa y with her. 
There were many witne ses, and my car was very visible And now 
we were on our way to Reno to get marrieQ. 

That is not the kind of news any big-time powermonger wants to 
hear when he gets back from lunch in the governor's dining room: 
Pardon me, sir, but the whole lown IS humming wilh lhe news about 
)Iour girlfriend disappearing out of Ricci 's wilh a bald drifter in ~ 
hopped-up Chevy cOl1l'erllble with Colorado plates .. . The phone IS 
ringing off the hook. Whal should I tell them? 

What indeed? And what hould Itell them when we are stopped at a 
CH P roadblock on the outskirts of Truckee and her boyfriend swoops 
d own in a helicopter and orders men in black suit to beat a confession 
out of me? 

And what would she ay? That we had fallen in love at first sight in 
the mid st of an orgy at lunchtime and she had suddenly changed her 
mind about everything in her life? 

Probably not. They would drag me away in steel-mesh animal net 
and execute me like Caryl Chessman. Any story I told would mean 
nothing compared to hers. My fate was in her hands. F E'ELING CRAZY HAS never really worried me, It is an occupational hazard and on some days I even get paid for it 

- but there are some things that even crazy people can't get 
away with, and this idea of turning around and driving back to 
Sacramento to pick up Jilly's birth certificate seemed to be one of them . 

"Don't worry about him," she said . " He's having dinner with some 
tax lobbyists tonight. I'll just run in and get a little uitcase. h won't 
take two minutes." 

I shrugged and turned around. What the hell? J thought. Buy the 
ticket , take the ride. There was madness in either direction . And 
besides, I was beginning to like the girl. 

She was a dangerous dingbat with a very pure dedication to the Love 
and Adventure ethic - but I recognized a warrior when I met one, and 
on the way down the mountain I knew what Clyde must have felt like 
when he first met Bonnie.

Letters 

Ad Hominem 
Thinking Bad 
Editor: 

I would like to make an obser-
vation concerning M r. Paul A . 
Trout's letter (Guardian. Feb. 9) . 
Fir t. let me say I agree with mo t 
of what M r. Trout has to say 
about the parking problem, and 
think much of hi letter was well-
written . 

One aspect of the letter with 
which I take is ue, however, i 
Mr. Trout's list of categories into 
which he places Joseph McKin-
ley: "I) he live at Warren apart-
ments on campus, 2) he is a 
freshman, and 3) he is a Pre-A mes 
major." ow, I agree that the first 
point may be an appropriate 
premi e for Mr. Trout's argu-
ment. but how on earth does the 
fact that Mr. McKinley is a Pre-
Ames major affect either his a bil-
ity to write, or the validity of his 
argument'? 

Mr. Trout continues, "Not to 
knock the writing ability of Pre-
Ames majors. but the logic of M r. 
McKinley's essay is baffling." If 
he truly wi he to pursue the 
rigor of logical argument, how-
ever, I uggest that Mr. Trout 
examine this point very carefully. 
He asserts that Mr. McKinley' 
argument is illogical, yet attri-
butes at least some of his illogic to 
M r. McKinley's status a a Pre-
Ames major. 

To be technical for a moment , I 
believe the specific logical fallacy 
to which Mr. Trout has fallen 
prey is known as argumentum ad 
hominem; he has allowed his per-
sonal feelings about Pre-Ames 
majors to influence his appraisal 
of M r. McKinley's letter. 

Unfortunately, this mode of 
argument is not rare. In the "real 
world" (the place where st udents 
go when they graduate) familiar 
manifestations include racism, 
sexism, and all the most revulsive 
prejudice of modern society. Here 
at UCSD we seem to have (to 
coin a word) majorism. I am sure, 
forexample , Mr. Trout has heard 
that all Commu nication majors 
look gorgeou and handsome and 
have easy classes. I have certainly 
heard about the eccentricity and 
poor social skills of CSE majors. 

M r. Trout, such generalizations 
belong - if anywhere - in the 
pages of the Koala, and not in 
letters to the editor of the Guard-
ian.

Drums not 
" Anarchic" 
Editor: 

In response to the article on the 
"Bongo Drummers" (Guardian, 
Jan. 30), I just couldn't believe 
some of the implications which 
were suggested . As a fellow 
member of the musician society, I 
can understand the enjoyment 
and satisfaction that is derived 
from playinga musical instrument 
in public. 

Furthermore, I believe that 
everyone ha had, at one time or 
another, a desire to beat on a 
drum head. However, I'm sure 
that they did not want to play 
drums to get the feel of an 
"anarchic lifestyle. ,. Percu~sion 
rhythms may be amorphous or 
unstructured, but "anarchic?" 
Come on, does that make trumpet 
players conservative? 

I guess some feelings may be 
exuded from playing a percussion 
instrument. amely, hit it harder 
and the sound will get propor-
tionally louder. We all know what 
loud means; anger, frustration, 
and protest. Yeah, right. If you 
get any deeper than that , it 
becomes a battle of personal 
interpretations (like poetry). More 
confusion and anger,just what we 
need . That is not "jammin' for 
justice. " 

Also, playing drums at protests 
and demonstrations is merely 
enterta inment , providing a beat 
for prote tors to dance away their 
anger with . It would be absurd to 
think that the presence of drums 
at a demonstration or protest 
should influence a major change 
in society. Let's take a hint from 
student Pete Emanuelle, who says, 
"It's fun and a form of relaxation."

More Points 
On Parking 
Editor: 

This letter is a counter-response 
to the two "parking" letters 
(Guardian, Feb. 9). 

Spawned by my letter about 
the UCSD students'attitude prob-
lem, Michael S. Moore's response 
was nothing more than a personal 
attaek the tone and support of 
which only erved to prove the 
point of my original letter. The 
students themselves (or at least 
one of the students) have now 
shown that they have an attitude 
problem . (And just to clari,fy 
things, I never claimed that "park-
ing" was a pleasure. I said that 
"life" was a pleasure.) 

Upon reading the second re-
sponse to my letter by Paul A. 
Trout, I realized that he had mis-
understood the details as well as

Q and A: Do you think there's a problem with racism at UCSD? 

I don't really think that there 
is racism at UCSD. However 
it may seem like it because 
many people try to find a 
belonging by identifying them-
selves with or by joining orga-
nizations / clubs of similar (their 
own) backgrounds.

Parking 
Continued from page 4 
the major purpose of my letter. 
The au thor referred to me in this 
way: " I) he lives at Warren apart-
ment on campus, 2) he is a 
freshman, and 3) he is a Pre-
AMES major." 

Here is my response: I) I live at 
Warren apartments on campus. 
" Warren apartments" is the oper-
ative phrase, not "on campus." 
The walk from Warren apart-
ments is undeniably equal to or 
greater than the walk from every 
single parking lot on campus. 
And I have had the opportun ity 
of waking up well before class 
time in order to make the walk. 
By saying " He .. . lives on campus 
and therefore has no right to triv-
ialize the ... parking problem; 
after all, he only has to walk to his 
classes a few minutes away," the 
author/ tudent ha inadvertently 
proven my point. He read ily 
claims tha t I only have to walk a 
few easy minutes to class, but 
Warren is at least as far as if not 
farther than all of the parking 
lots. Therefore, the author has 
admitted that the walk from any 
parking lot is an easy one and ha 
proved a point of my original let-
ter. In addition, the Warren park-
ing lots have never been full . Why 
hasn't this st udent avoided his 
"parking problems" by parking in 
the Warren lot and making t hat 
simple walk? 

2) I am a sophomore, not a 
freshman. The entry in the phone 
directory is incorrect. But just say 
I was a freshman, what difference 
does that make? Is this a per onal 
attack or a class attack') If a per-
son is a freshman , is hi opinion 

le~s significant? 
3) Yes, I am a Pre-AME 

major. What does my major have 
to do with parking') Is this a 
cover-up attack using the preju-
diced, s tereotypical "engi neer" 
image? 

rhe author of the response 
claims that the logic of my essay is 
··baffling." He says, "To make a 
co nnection between the high pri e 
of park ing and the benefiu of 
walking to cla ss ... is a inine ." I 
couldn't agree more, and that is 
why I never made that connec-
tion . They were two 'eparate 
points , presented ide-by-side to 
support my overall message . Per-
haps the author should consider 

I don't think that racism is 
really evident. But there does 
seem to be some undertones of 
racism at UCSD toward the 
minorities because of the aca-
demic challenge present toward 
other students.

tha t it is h is own reading ability 
that needs to improve ratherthan 
another person's writing. 

T he author writes, "To be 'glad' 
to pay $144 for abysmal parking 
and inadequate daytime security 
is a phrase I though t I would 
never hear uttered by another 
UCSD student." Well, he forgot 

Since I started attending 
UCSD three years ago, I've 
seen a lot more minorities at 
this school which is good. But 
to me it seems they're just 
doing it to fill a quota, as 
opposed to making an earnest 
attempt to integrate. So asfar 
as racism goes, it s there, but 
its sugar-coated.

the other half of the sentence. 
What I said in my original letter 
was more along the lines of, "A 
student should 'be glad to pay 
$144 for abysmal parking and 
inadequate daytime security' in-
stead of paying $144 for extra tui-
tion, because it scares away some 
of the potential parkers ."

In the remainder of his re-
sponse, Paul A. Trout gives sev-
eral excellent solutions to the 
"parking problem." Of course, I 
had considered one or two of 
these solutions myself. but "find-
ing a solution" was not the point 
of my letter. My only purpose was 
to get people to try looking at the 

problem with a better attitude 
and thereby reducing the need to com-
plain uselessly. Paul A. Trout is 
right , " Bitching will get you no-

pective will.

UCSD Looks 
Unattractive 
Editor: 

I would like to address a prob-
lem that we have on campus and 
that man) people do not seem to 
consider much or a t all. The prob-
lem in question is the current 
phy ical condi ti on of o ur cam pus. 

The fact is that if a person \\ere 
~isiting UC 0 and did not know 
that it was a university , that per-
son's as e sment would not likely 

be that he ~he \\a~ touring an 
in tit ute of higher learning. I mean 
to a~k the reader to consider the 
following: garbage and rcc clablc 
good~ cluttering el'er,r lect ure hall 
and c1as room; a collage of chew-
ed gu m and graffit i coveri ng nea r-
Iy e\ ery ~quare inch of desk ~pace 
in the main library, underg radu-
ate library, and lecture halls (not 
to mention the traditional ~oph­
omoric atrocities adorni ng most 
of the campus' restroom walls): 
the slovenly appearance of the 
public eating fa ilitics (i .e., aban-
doned tables bearing a range of 
items from trays and plates to 
conglomerat ion. of I\asted foods 
and dnnks); a nd finally the sorry 
state of the vegetation canl-
pus-wide. 

OPINION 
These gripe~ are ~elf-explan­

uta ry. with the po~~ible e;\ cepti o n 
of the state of our plant life . The 
problem to be addressed regard-
ing the foliage i~ that people seem 
to feel the need tocut pathsacro~~ 

lawn~, between s hrub" and 
through groves of tree~ all of 
wh ich makes for a rather unat -
tractive campus. 

Perhaps it i, asking too much 
of college student s to take some 
care of their surroundings; that is, 
to ha\ e some co nsiderations for 
their colleagues II ho would rather 
ha\ e their campus looking re-
spectable. Evident l) , the trash 
cans and walkways do not suggest 
anything to some U SD student s. 
If we can't keep our trash in the 
cans, our pens to our papers, and 

our feet on the pathway, then 
perhaps '>ome SD entrance 
requirement adjusting is in order. 

W e ca n either ha ve a nice cam-
pus and live up to what should be 
expected of unilersit - level stu-

dent~ , or we can live in cxcre-
ment .

1 stood o\er the hole with a two-
foot olid iron pick, trying to fig-
ure out how to lever out the rock 
that blocked further diggi ng. Paul 
Rogers tood next to me. Hi 
hands pointed out t o a wave of 
roofs. 
. Three years ago, he explai ned, 

Colonia Panamericano was a gar-
bage dump . Entire families 
scrounged through the junk to 
find glass that could be recycled . 
The day's earnings equaled no 
more than $5 for ten hour work. 

I nodded , driving the pick into 
the dirt and pulling; the rock 
gave. Rogers continued: Today 
the colonia has a president , Miguel 
Mendoza; it ha electric power 
lines ready to be hooked up, a 
general store, a health clinic, even 
a restaura nt that his wife, T ara 
O'Reilly, runs. In three years, 
Rogers estimated, the community 
had suceeded in doubli ng its aver-
age income. 

Familie now ra ise pigs a nd 
salvage metal to ell to a booming 
metal recycl ing busi ness ru n by 
Mendoza . In the morn ings, he 
used to watch children and their 
mothers working alongside t he 
men in the dump, fi lling bags with 
broken glass. Now, o n mornings 
at Colonia Panamericano, located 
in Tijua na. Mexico, the men hop 

into their tru cks and ta ke off to 
collect scra p metal. 

I had come with a group of II 
students from Fifth ollege a nd 
the International House to work 
at Colonia Panamericano. Rog-
ers and his wife, bot h America n , 
have le\ ived there for three yea rs. 
I was upon thei r invit ation that 
we emered the community. 

They encouraged us 
to get green cards. We 
thought they were jok-
ing. They weren't. 

Before we ever set foot into 
Tijuana, we had already read an 
es a y on poverty written by Men-
doza. The mood of the group was 
wary. Deana Slater, assistant res-
ident dean o f Fifth College, warn-
ed u to ex pect something differ-
ent. Her face reflected concern as 
she quiet ly instructed u on what 
they day held in store for the 
group. 

Rogers , she said , was very clear 
on the point that they did not 
need our help . We were entering a 
community tha t could take care 
of itself. She added that we were 
to be paid for our labor - lunch.

saying t he Roger had enco ur· 
aged us to get green cards. We 
tho ug ht they were joking. As it 
turned o ut, they weren't. 

O 'Reilly invited us into the cuI · 
tural center, which double as a 
restaura nt. For an hour a nd a hal f 
he ta lked a bout the community 

and it pla n . As we sat in the cold 
windy room, listening to her 
speak, I aw discomfort , shock, 
and confusion wash over the faces 
of my peers. 

O'Reilly summarized Mendo-
za's essay in her own words, say-
ing that charity enslaves the poor. 
In her experiences as both a giver 
and receiver, she had found the 
system deplorable. The constant 
influx of food and clothing gave 
the needy no reason to help them-
selves. 

By coming to Colonia Pan-
america no, she continued, we were 
not necessarily helping. If our 
mission was charity, they did not 
need us . If our mission was to 
help the community. it would be 
beller for us to try securing loans 
and grants back in the United 
States. 

What we could do was limited. 
O'Reill y gave the group three 
choices: helping her in the cultu-
ral center, digging holes for fence 
posts, or cleaning trash and bricks 
from a playground area. I chose 
to dig.

Meals Donated Through 
Food Services to Feed 
San Diego's Hungry 

By RANDY DOTlNGA 
Slall Wriler 

The San Diego Food Bank will 
oon receive a check for more than 

$1 ,700 thanks to UCSDstudent . 
The donation is a result of a 

food drivel hunger fast sponsored 
bv the Inter-Colle~e Residence 
Hall Association (ICRHA). More 
than 1,000 students sacrificed their 
Wednesday night dinner to help 
feed the hungry in San Diego. 

"The purpose of the hunger fa t 
is to feed the hungry in our own 
community," said .Beth Stephens, 
Muir representative to ICHRA. 
The hunger fast has been a tradi-
tion at UCSD for seven years. 

In an effort to encourage stu-
de nts to donate their meals, stu-
dent volunteers from all five col-
leges set up tables near campus 
cafeteria where students could 
sign up to sacrifice their meals 
Stephens said . ' 

or each rt:leal donated , $1. 70 
goes toward the food drive. Many 
student s have wondered about 
the small amount per sacrificed 
meal that goes to the hungry 
becau e, on a 19-meal-per-week 

plan, each dinner is worth about 
$3.90. "A lot of people have been 
upset by that," Stephens stated. 

According to Cynthia Bush of 
the Meal Plan Office, the $1.70 
donation per meal sacrificed is 
"the raw food cost." The rest of 
the meal cost goes toward over-
head, such as salaries and admin-
istrative costs, and is not availa-
ble to go to the food drive, Bush 
said. 

Students have also wondered 
why they cannot donate meals 
they were already planning to 
skip, such as meal on weekends. 
According to Director of Hous-
ing and Food Services Larry Bar-
rett, a student on-campus hous-
ing and food service committee 
originally decided that hunger 
fa ts must not occur on weekends 
or other times when students often 
skip meals anyway, because the 
meal sacrifice is intended to be in 
"the spirit of a fast." 

Barrett added that if students 
were to donate a meal they were 
not planning to eat in the first 
place, "It would just be a dona-
tion . . . if you want to pass the hat, 
you can do that. The spirit of the 
fast is wlJat's important, and the

ontinued from page 8 
Standing outsid e, a fellow stu-

de nt a nd I used the iron pick and 
a broken shovel to place 15 two· 
foot deep holes in the ground . It 
wa s then that Rogers walked up 
and started talking to us. 

After explaining the history of 
Colonia Panamericano, Rogers 
added his comment on the com-
munity's self sufficiency. Whereas 
before the commu nity needed 
food and clothing from charity to 
get by, now they helped them-
selves . The president had been so 
uccessful with his recycling busi-

ne s that he built the general store 
to supply hi people with ba ic 
neccessities. 

I looked down at my hands, 
which I noticed were covered with 
bli ters and two cut . When I 
a ked Roger if the oil was hard 
to dig in, he said the local men dig 
ten feet down with the same tools 
we were u ing. 

My hands were cover-
ed with bliste rs. The 
local men dig ten feet 
down w ith the same 
tools we were using. 

The local men did more than 
dig holes. In the past three year, 
they built all the hou es, built 
storm breakers in the road and 
started an entrepenurial business 
of scrap metal collection which 
involved selling to Mendoza 
ratherthan to go-betweens. Men-
doza pays "them fair prices for 
their work and they, in turn, 
supply him with material to re-
cycle. 

Rogers stressed the fact that 
the community was in need of 
neither handouts, nor pity. What 
they need, he argued, are loans 
and grants for futher expansion 
of the metal business and , more 
importantly, they need medicine. 
Other than basic medical care, the 
community can provide for most 
of its needs. 

If anyone wanted to really help 
'these people, he said , the key was 
in gelling them good medicine 
and support from local charities 
a nd corporations in the form of 
loan . With loans they could ex-
pand their economic opportu n i-
ties and grow as a community. 

Both Rogers and O'Reilly had 
told us repeatedly throughout the 
afternoon that the people of Co-
lonia Panamericano were proud 
of t heir achievements and sus pi-

cious of "charity groups". We had 
to win tleirrespect and trust if we 
wanted tu help. 

They stressed the destructive 
effect s of making the people de-
pendent on our donations. fhe 
cycle of charit y and poverty had, 
in their eyes, des troyed a good 
part of Mexico 's populace already. 
Colonia Panamerican o was a 
change. a new system that offered 
it people both hope and dignit y. 

Rogers went on to say that 
what work in Tijuana will work 
anywhere in the Third World. 
The point was to support people 
economically. Loans, grants , job 
and other form of self-help aid 
would spur the recipients' ambi-
tion and allow for more long-
term improvement. Only through 
economic reform, he said, could 
the cycle of poverty be broken. 

As I put down the pick and got 
in the van to leave, what struck 
me most sharply was the fact that 
I had so many blisters after dig-
ging only one fifth as deep as the 
local men. When the van pulled 
away and wound down the rocky 
trail back to the highway, I re-
alized that many of my own ste-
reotypes had been changed while 
digging holes to build a new fence.

co mmittee felt that way .. . The

Barrett also said that the com-
mittee decided that fasts should 
not occur more than once a quar-
ter, "so students in the residence 
halls won't be pressured to give 
up a meal and be inconvenienced 
ve ry often." 

ICHRA, whi ch sponsored last 
night's fast, is "in it s first year of 
really being an independent stu-
dent organization," Stephens said . 
It consists of representatives from 
the Residence Hall Councils of all 
fi ve colleges . The purpose of 
ICH RA is "to provide events and 
programming for the entire cam-
pus," Stephens said . 

Despite the fact that only $1 .70 
from each sacrificed meal goes 
toward the hungry, Stephen em-
phasized that it is still an impor-
tant project, adding that, "In the 
long run the whole contribution is 
very much worth it."

Baseball Improves to 3-1 With 
A 6-2 Win Over Point Lorna 

By CRAIG PETER 
Comriburing Writer 

Rick Rupkey struck out even 
and allowed only two runs to give 
the Tritons a 6-2 victory Tuesday 
afternoon over the Point loma 
Nazarene Crusaders. 

There was a brief scare in the 
top of the ninth when. down 6-1, 
the Crusaders loaded up the bases 
with two outs. After a shot 10 
right field, a run cored, but a 
Crusader was picked off at third 
after overrunning the base and 
the Tritons improved their record 
to 3-1. 

UCSD began the scoring in the 
fir t inning by jumping out 10 a 
2-0 lead. Brian Crawford reached 
first when he laid down a beauti-
ful bunt which threw the Cru ad-
ers' pitcher off. Gar Fessia fol-
lowed with a ingle to left field. 
With two on, catcher Jim Mar-
tinez tripled 10 left-center, scori ng 

Henry Jimenez s,ngled and scored In the sixth inning Tuesday. 

two. 

Point Loma could not seem to 
get thing going until the top of 
the fourth . After a base hit and a 
stea.! , Dave owlan made a nice 
play at first, but the runner 
advanced to third. On a rip by 
third ba e, the Crusaders cored 
and Point Lorna found it elf back 

... . 

in the game with the deficit cut to 
2-1. 

The game became quiet until 
the Tritons erupted in the bottom 
of the sixth. Henry Jimene7 led 
off the inning by nailing a shot 10 
left. Martinez kept UCSD alive 
with a shot to right and pushed 
Jimenez across the plate. With 
one on and two out, Dave Liger-
rna n stepped up and powered 
a home run over the left field 

fence. The Tritons went into the 
eventh inning with confidence 

and a 5-1 lead . 

In the top of the seventh , Rup-
key pitched magnificently when 
he induced Point Lorna hitters 
into a ground out and two strike-
outs. In the bottom of the inning 
UCSD added an in urance run 
when Ernie Isola doubled and 
Brian Crawford singled to the left

Not only is UCSO's New Music Forum an essential outlet for composition stu-

dents, it also provides engaging new music for the community. The forum combines 
student and faculty compositions of instrumental, tape, videotape, electronic, 
theatrical, and improvisational nature. 

The name New Music Forum has recently come about due to a lack of understand-
ing of the previous name, Atomicafe. 

"People thought that food would be involved, and we also wanted to create a more 
professional attitude." said Chris Herzog. 

Herzog, along with Linda Swedensky and Frank Cox, maintain responsibilities for 
the entire group, which include seeking graduate. undergraduate and faculty com-
positions, coordinating performers for the compositions, organizing receptions, 
concerts, and rehearsals, sending press releases and public service announce-
ments, and providing publicity around campus. Although they are not paid. they 
put many hours of labor into the job. Frank Cox states his motiviation as "a need to 
build interest in new music, however possible." 

According to Cox, new music is serious music which "directs more than one 
emotion, building them on top of one another, kind of gritty. Music is one of the 
deepest expressions of a culture, it may change your perspective on nature, and 
even offer perspectives on life." 

Cox found that after achieving classical training in cello performance it became 
"more and more absurd to play works by European composers written one hundred 
years ago." 

Roger Reynolds, a rel'1owned composer and faculty member at UCSD, describes 
his penchant for new music: "I don't like the idea of working only in a context where 
everything has to be a trend, and modified, and compomised, to fit what I know is 
practical. I do pieces that are exactly what I want to do, sort of experiments, and 
don't have anything to do with practical concerns. It has to do with exploring, 
answering questions." 

A two.-day New Music Forum Festival is planned for Feb. 21 and 22 at 8 p.m. in 
MandeVIlle Recital Hall. On the first night, compositions bv Joji Yuasa. Mamoru 
Fujieda, Gai Wei Yin, Randall Giles, Mart Osborne, Tom North, Herzog, and 
Swedensky wi" be performed. 

Joji Yuasa's piece "Cosmos Haptic II" alludes to making contact with some 
aspect of the cosmos through the touch of the pianist. He suggests that the 
audience listen to the reverberations of the piano, which he studies in the piece, 
rather than the written notes. Yuasa says, "I wanted to create a oneness with the 
universe and myself." 

Another interesting highlight of Tuesday night's performance wi" be Herzog's 
"Hym·n." He will physically place performers and speakers around the audience 
so the music will have a surrounding effect. 

Wednesday's program wi" open with a computer piece called "Waterfa"" bv Brian 
Jackson, ethnomusicologist and composer. His music is inspired by Indonesian 
pentatonic scales and repeated rhythmic patterns. "These patterns delayed 
slightly and then mixed back with the original marimba sound give the music a 
pleasant slowing and free falling effect, hence the name," explains Jackson. 

Also featured on Wednesday is the world premiere of Professor Roger Reynold?' 
"Version Stages I-IV." Inspired by the series paintings of Monet which depict the 
same content in different lighting, Reynolds utilizes a five-minute musical paradigm 
four times, each time beginning with a different one-minute sound sample. His 
samples range from waves in La Jo"a Cove to the voice of a Japanese actress. 

The festival will also include a piece written by Eric Lyon, entitled "Wetwork." He 
describes it as "music written by a maniac for a maniac." 

The leaders of New Music Forum are aiming for the future. They would like to bring 
their music out into the community and away from the University. They want people 
to recognize New Music Forum as a separate entity, not just another student 
function. Another goal in mind is to create concert exchanges with other 
universities. 

New Music Forum is funded by the Graduate Student Association and also by the 
music department. Their association with GSA has led to an invitation to perform at 
the opening ceremonies of the new Price Center on April 27. 

New Music Forum is one of the most innovative groups at UCSO. It is the only 
venue in which student composers can offfer their work to the public. It is essential 
for them to receive feedback in this manner. This two-day festival on Feb. 21-22 
promises to be a valuable experience for the composers, performers, ar;'ld spectators.

Suds, a frothy celebration fea-
turing '50s and '60s songs, is cur-
rently playing at th", Lyceum 
Theatre in Horton Plaza . This 
spoof takes one back to a place 
where Johnny Angels ran rampant 
with their teen angels. 

The story i st!t in a groovy, 
psychedelic laundromat. Its plot, 
which is minimal to say the least, 
revolves around two guardian 
angels sent on a mission from 
God, or perhaps Motown, to mus-
ically assuage a love struck girl, 
whose pen pal lover dropped her 
before he even met her. 

Another "light" motif found 
throughout Suds is how to catch 
that perfect man every girl needs 
in order to be a complete person 
in the '50s. 

If you like listening to '50s and 
'60s songs such as " Respect," "The 
Boy I'm Going to Marry," "Chapel 
of Love" and "Locomotion," and 
if you want a very light, escapist, 
be-happy kind of "good clean 
fu n" filled evening, then Suds is a 
must . 

On the other hand, if you art!n't 
too keen on '50s and '60s music, 
and if vou can't take more than an 
hour and a half of non-stop hap-
piness, then don 't bother seeing 
this one. But if your grandparents 
are in town, consider Suds the 
evening's entertainment.

Last week 's production of Fox 
DII('t at the tudio Theatrl' on 
campus was a textbook exam pIt' 
of intimacy and Impli city in 
theatrt'. 

Tht' ft't'ling of Intimacy was 
providt'd by the the3tre it df. The 
pIa wa pt'ri'ormed in a small 
room. in front of a small audience, 
by only three actor who wt're 
usually wlthm 15 feet of the spec-
tators. This clost' atmosphere 
provided an intense experit'nce 
since every facial expression and 
every detail in costume came into 
the viewer's focus. 

The play was simple be'cause it 
used only one set in a strictly con-
fined space. Some of the action 
took place in an outdoor setring 
while other scenes were in a living 
room. 

The sets never changed, how-
ever, so one could see the living 
room set while action was taking 
place out of doors. ThiS simplicity 
was very effective because it placed 
the brunt of the performance on 
actors' abilities. Their raw talent 
shone through the sparse surround-
ings . 

Fox Duec, which was based on 
the novella The Fox, by D.H. 
Lawrence, is a story about tWO

OPENS FRIDAY AT A THEATRE NEAR YOU. 

the human experience. 
As Is is produced by Alan Craig 

DiBona, a UCSD student pres-
ently completing his degree in 
theatre. Other cast members are 
Larry Baza, Pat Dimeo, Rick Kuru, 
Barry Mann, Jeff Okey, Chris 
Redo, and Julie Small. 

As Is (its tirle very close to the 
word AIDS) is a story about the 
young, cursed and blessed charac-
ter Rich. Rich, played by Jeff 
Okey, is a promising writer of 
poems and short stories with a 
new book coming o ut . However, 
Rich discovers that his lymph 
glands are swollen and that he has 
contracted AIDS Related Com-
plex (ARC). 

Suddenly Rich's life is cast into 
being" one of them." He is treated 
as a leper by family and friends, 
except by one man , his ex-lover, 
Saul. 

Saul, played by Barry Mann, is 
incredibly kind, giving and com-
passionate. He is d riven by an 
unconditional love that is unex-
plainable. Saul guides Rich down 
the hallway of despair filled only 
with deeper and darker shadows 
as they go along. Saul is proud to 
say he accepts Rich, "as is." 

There is an upside to all this 
misery. Although Rich's life is 
degenerating day by day, those 
around him, family and friends, 
finally come around. They begin 
to accept him all over again , trying 
to understand themselves and their 
fear . 

The best thing about As Is is 
that al though it is based on a 
highly depressing topic, it is an 
incredibly funny play. There are 
many o ne lint:rs that leave you 

laughing well after one ends and 
another one begins. 

Many of the stereotypes of the 
gay community and AIDS are 
heightened and played out. In one 
particular bar scene, all the gay 
stereotypes are present. Tough 
guys in leather, bare-chested, and 
riding motorcycles talk of whips 
and chains, while on the other side 
of the bar are the loud, flamboy-
ant, pretentious gay men. This 
scene is incredibly funny, as it 
depicts the absurdity of stereo-
types. 

Another scene midway though 
the play is quite moving. All the 
performers on stage stop talking 
within their particular sets and call 
out the names of people they 
knew who died of AIDS. The 
scene works well and you get a 
sense that perhaps everyone in the 
audience would also like to shout 
out the name of a lost loved one. 

All performances were very 
good and believable. Small gave a 
fine performance playing two 
characters. Her principle charac-
ter is a shallow, indecisive, explo-
sive fema le friend of Rich's. 

Small also plays a pregnant 
woman who has contracted the 
AIDS virus. The hift between the 
two characters was smooth and 
almost unnoticable. After talking 
with Small, it is obvio us how 
diverse the two people are and 
what a wonderful job she does at 
portraying rhein both. 

"Each character required dif-
ferent energies. You had to com-
pletely change everything: emo-
tions, facial gestures, mannerisms, 
with the drop of a l'in," she said. 

Small is an undergraduate here

Turn Down the Noise

How often did your parents yell 
at you, " Turn down that noise! " 
And how often did you try, in 
vain, to convince them you were 
listening to music, not "noise." I 
wish I was playing The First of a 
Million Kisses then, the debut 

album of Fai rground Attraction. I 
would have lowered the needle

The 11 original songs range 
from deep and melancholy to edgy

"We wanted to purify, not sim-

o T o 'Picture This: 150 Years 
by m arci aro n oviu 

h iatus writer 

The La Jolla Museum of Con-
temporary Art (L]MCA) cele-
brates the 1 50th anniversary of the 
advent of photography with a col-
lection of photographs from the 
private collection of Elaine and 
Dr. R. Joseph Monsen of Seattle, 
Washington. 

The exhibit is an amazing over-
view of 150 years of photography, 
with 117 photographs ranging 
from the earliest to the most con-
temporary. The exhibit is only a 
small percentage of the Monsens' 
notable collection which they 
began in the 1960s. The exhibi-
tion. curated by LJMCA Director 
Hugh M . Davies, presents the 
medium of photography as a his-
tory, an art, and a pure aesthetic 
pleasure. 

The exhibit provides a broad 
spectrum of the progression of 
photography, highlighting the 
works of some of the most 
influential photographers of our 

neers of the photogr2phic art form 
such as Hill and Adamson, 
Carleton, Watkins, Gustave Le 
Gray, Brassai, and Ansel Adams. 
In addition, the exhibit displays 
works by many contemporary 
photographers including John 
Baldessari, Andy Warhol, Cindy 
Sherman, Robert Longo, and the 
Star Twins. These and many other 
notables are ea h represented by 
one or two of their works.

or to comment on a different 
perception of the same thing. By 
juxtaposing photographs not only 
are the differences apparent, but 
there are also subtle visual con-
nections to make between the 
photographs. 

As an additional display a 
camera obscura, which preceeded 
photography, is set up in a room of 
its own and provides an amazing 
view of the La Jolla Shores. T he 
camera consists of a dark chamber 
and lens which projects an image 
onto an opposite surface. The 
shore is projected upside down 
and covers an entire wall. The 
scene is a life size projection of 
natural colors in a confined space 
- it is like watching a living 
photograph.

A scene from The Government Inspector, (1 to r )Jim Morlino; Kari McGee 
and Kate Malin . 

Mistaking a traveling stranger 
for the insp.:ctor. they clumsily 
try to. brihe him. The st ranger is 
no fool and proceeds to take the 
villagers for all they are worth . 

The play was wrirten to lamba t 
corruption and stupidity 10 the 
Russian government at tht' time, 
but IS the message stili relevant 
today! 

"[t still holds, the abuse of 
power and corruption," says Pret-
zinger, "I don't want people to 
think I'm showing Ollie North 
and GtOrge Bush. I want people to 
sec themselves." 

Gogol intended for the play to 
be mural rather than satirical. " ['d 
ca ll it comic ab urdity, rather than 
sati re," commented Pretzinger. 

The play itself is entertaining 
and often hilarious, but I am 
un ure of the success of Pretzin-
ger's intentions . But before I get to 
my criticisms, let me tell you the 
positive aspects. On the whole, 
the acting is we!1 done, with nota-
ble standouts being Patrick Miller 
as the inspector and Kate Malin as 
the mayor's wife. 

Miller i~ easily the standout of 
the play and in many ways its 
savior. He plays his role with a 
great deal of exuberance and verve. 
His slapstick enjoyment of the 
play shows and makes all the 
scenes he is in all the more delight-
ful. Malin similarly brings joy to 
the performance, and her scenes 
with Miller are easily the most 
pleasurable. 

On the down side, the acting of 
the other players is very inconsist-
ent. Andy Weems as the mayor is 
probably the most guilty offender, 
as he has the largest role. His

play could have had more room to 
breathe and develop. With the 
mall quarter the play felt like it 

wa going to be an "arty" produc~ 
tion. omething new and pr bably 
"deep." 

But The GotJernment Inspector 
plays like a traightforward 
omedy for the fir t act and most 

of the second. It uddenly changes 
gear after the stranger makes ff 
with the t wnspeople's money to 
where everybody, (especially the 
Mayor) becomes deep and inrro~ 
spective. He goe into an extended 
soliloquy about hi failings and 
then extends it to encompa all 
humankind. 

He says something funny, the 
audience laughs and he insult the 
audience. I don't know if this is 
the way Gogol had written it or if 
this is one of Pretzinger's own 
ideas, but I thought it was in very

of a ingular direction that ulti~ 
mately brings this play down.
