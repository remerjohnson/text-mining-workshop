Congress 
Hopefu·ls 
Exchange 
Charges 
By DENISE DADOR 
Staff Writer 

With only days to the election, 
Democratic and Republican can-
didates vying to represent the 
41 st congressional district are 
trying to set the record straight 
on major issues concerning 
UCSD students and their com-
munity. 

Democratic candidate Daniel 
Kripke, who is challenging 
Republican incumbent Bill Low-
ery for the second time, has 
attacked his opponent's voting 
record on education, environ-
ment, women's rights and health 
care issues. 

The 41st Congressional District 
inJcudes UCSD, SDSU, USD, 
USIU, National University, Point 
Lorna College, Mesa College, 
Miramar College and several 
other institutions of higher learn-
ing. 

Kripke, a professor at UCSD's 
School of Medicine and director 
of the Sleep Disorders Clinic at 
the Veteran's Administration 
Hospital, claims that for a district 
which has more than 100,000

congressional district, which includes UCSD. 

students, faculty and staff, 
Lowery's stance on education is 
not in step with the needs of his 
constituents. 

"Because of his lack of educa-
tion he doesn't realize the impor-
tance of education," Kripke said . 
"The important thing to note 
here is that he's taking money 
out of students' pockets and out 
of UCSD." 

The Democratic candidate said 
he supports increased educational 
standards and funding. 

Kripke has documented in 
campaign brochures that Lowery 
has voted against education ap-
propriations, to reduce education 
funding and against UCSD's 
supercomputer. 

In a telephone interview from 
his Wash.ington D.C. office, 
Lowery disregarded Kripke's 
attacks on his education record 
and cited legislation that he 
supported preventing students 
from upper income families from 
taking out student loans and 
then investing the cash in money 

market mutual funds. 
"This was a real problem 
s~'Veral years ago, " Lowery said. 
"We tightened up on that pro-
cedure. 1 don't consider that to 
be anti-education." 

"My policy on student loans is 
that I don't want to see any 
student in America denied the 
opportunity to go to college for 
any reason." 

Lowery also said that he is a 
staunch supporter of UCSD's 
supercomputer. 

"There's not a bigger booster 
in Congress of the supercomputer 
than I. I believe it is the best run 
facility of its type in the entire 
country. " 

Lowery added that he backed 
the University Research Initia-
tive, which he said has resulted in 
54 million in federal funding for 
UCSD. 

The program, which started 
two years ago, allows for 5100 
million to be allocated to univer-
sities for research . He said

Debris Found 

Medical Waste 
at Black's Beach 

By MARY BEITY HEARD 
Contributing Writer 

Last weekend, lifeguards found 
medical waste, including vials of 
blood , syringes, gloves, and a 
hospital name tag, washed up on 
Black's Beach. 

All the items, except the 10 
bracelet, appeared fairly old , 
judging by the amount of marine 
growth on the items, according to 
Larry Aker, Assistant Deputy 
Director of the San Diego County 
Department of Health. 

The bracelet was traced to a 
Tri-City Medical Center patient 
by Gary Stephany, the Director 
of the environmental division of 
the Department of Health. 

The Los .Ang~/es Times re-
ported, however, that there ·is 
some confusion as to when and 
where the waste was disposed of. 

Aker said he sees no economic 
incentive for firms handling med-
ical waste disposal to dump waste 
in the ocean. It is more likely that 
the incident was caused by mis-
management. 

According to Aker, if the waste 
was left fairly accessible while on 
a transport boat, it is possible that 
someone rummaged through it in 
search of drug paraphernalia and 
threw pieces overboard in the 
process. 

He also mentioned that the sy-
ringes could have been used by 
drug abusers on boats and thrown 
overboard. 

Presently officials from the 

Department of Health are meet-
ing with disposal firms to deter-
mine exactly what happened and 
how this situation could have 
been prevented. 

At the moment, Aker is not 
worried about the health hazards 
posed by the waste. According to 
him, unless needles are washed 
ashore and stepped on, or sealed 
vials are opened, this type of 
waste is basically harmless. Aker 
expressed more concern with the 
possibility of drug users leaving 
their paraphernalia on beaches. 

Additionally, he mentioned that 
few diseases, especiaJly not the 
fragile AIDS virus, have the 
strength to survive the prolonged 
exposure to the salt water and the 
air. 

He is worried, however, about 
people opening vials or drug 
abusers overdosing on hospital 
medications, but concedes that 
those are worst case scenarios. 

Beach management is the only 
problem that Aker foresees. It is 
very difficult to clean up debris 
that washes ashore daily, he said . 

"None of us want to go with 
our families on the beach and all 
of a sudden find a blood vial. 
From a management point of 
view, we can't let that happen," 
Aker stated. 

This is not the first time that 
medical waste has surfaced on 
San Diego beaches. It has not 
always been washed ashore, 
though . Aker mentioned that 
many times it has been buried on

UCSD Institute Sponsors Moscow Arms Conference 
By KRISTINE CLARKE 
Guardian Intern 

The Institute on Global 
Conflict and Cooperation, head-
quartered at UCSD, recently 
sponsored in Moscow the Inter-
national Conference on Conven-
tional Armed Forces in Europe, 
"to actively involve UC faculty 
in the area of conventional arms 
control." 

security, military doctrine and 
strategy for NATOand Warsaw 
Pact nations, the impact of new 
technologies on conventional 
forces , and the assessment of 
military forces on each side. 

Sanford Lakoff, ptofessor of 
political science at UCSD, came 
away with a very positive impres-
sion of the conference. 

"Both sides agreed that the 
political conditions have changed 
so much in Europe that it's 
absurd to have these formidable 
military alignments facing each 
other," he said. 

UC faculty,lGCC researchers 
Soviet representatives, and sever-
al Europeans participated in the 
conventional arms control con-
ference from Oct. 4-6. An inter-
disciplinary research unit, the 
IGCC promote academic pro-
grams related to international 
peace and conflict on all UC 
campuses.

According to Greb, "It was 

the first time, to our knowledge, 
that the Soviets really empha-
sized that they recognized that

"The conference was not de-
signed to get a pecific proposal 
but to provide excellent contact 
for UC faculty," aid Alan 

Sweedler, conference coordina-
tor and professor of physics at 
SDSU. 

However, the conference also 
provided a beneficial forum for 
discussion. 

"There was an unbelievable 
exchange of information and 

idea at an informal level that 
nonetheless involved people who 
will take this information to the 
policy makers," said IGC re-
search coordinator Alan Greb. 

Presentations at the conven-
tional arms control conference 
addressed the future of European 

ecurity concern to be in Western 
Europe." Gla nost , the Soviet 
Union's policy of increased open-

in enabling the participant to

Protest at UCSB Leads to 
Arrest of Three Students 

SANTA BARBARA- Three UC Santa Barbara 
students and an activist for the homeless were arrested 
'Saturday Oct. 22 on charges of trespassing after 
participating in a sit-in at Congressman Robert 
Lagomarsino'S Santa Barbara campaign headquarters. 

The demonstration, held in protest of U.S. policy in 
EI Salvador, began as a rally ncar Stearn's Wharf, 
developed into a march up State Street and ended 
with an unexpected four-hour long sit-in at the 
Republican representative's office. During the sit-in, 
UCSB students Karen Zapata, Cara Yoshizumi, Lisa 
Ladmer and Tri-County Council for the Homeless 
member Don Hamilton were arrested. 

The four protestors were booked into county jail 
for refusing to leave the office. Each was charged with 
one count of trespassing, police reported. 

Bail was set at $500 each, but late Saturday night, 
all except Hamilton were released on their own rec-
ognizance. Two outstanding warrants kept Hamilton 
in custody, police said.

Chancellor Atkinson Recommends 
Changes For the Next President 

BOSTON- Chancellor Richard C. Atkinson 
attended the annual meeting of the Society of Research 
Administrators beginning Oct. II. During the meeting 
he expressed a desire to see the next president create a 
cabinet level science adviser. 

Atk.inson, as the former director of the National 
Science Foundation and the incoming president of the 
American Association for the Advancement of 
Science, pointed to several areas he felt the next pres-
ident should pay special attention to. These areas 
include: the development of a coherent federal 
research policy; setting priorities for completing 
billion-dollar projects, such as "Star Wars" or the 
space station; improvement of the nation's public 
school system and the reform of tax, patent and 
export laws. 

Atkinson also said that the next president should 
establish basic ground rules for priorities among 
"mega projects " such as the Strategic Defense I nitia-

tive, the National Aerospace Plan, and the Manned 
Space Station. 

Also mentioned as a concern of Atkinson's is "the 
sorry state of pre-college education in this country ... 
[which repr~sents] ... a looming resource crisis for the 
national research system." 

He felt that many of these problems could be solved 
with th ... addition of a department devoted to science 
and to research)

The UCSD Guardian NEWS 

BEACH: Medical Waste Found at Blacks 
Continued from pale I 
the beach for some time before 
appearing. 

According to the Los Angeles 
Times, last weekend's discovery 
is the third such incident in six 
months. In the past, however, the 

amounts were small and well-
contained enough for lifeguards 
to simply dispose of properly. 

The problem of medical waste 
washing ashore gained national 
attention when the east coast was 
plagued with a rash of such 

SIHk'. S .. ch: Medical waste washed up here last weekend.

Continued from pale I 
hold frank discussion. "It is clear 
glasnost had an effect on the 
conference since many of the 
statements [presented] were un-
usual," Sweedler said. 

Since his last visit to Moscow 
in the summer of 1985,just after 
Gorbachev's ascension to the 
office of general secretary, 
UCSD political science profes-
sor Philip Roeder has perceived 
"a strik.ing change in the Soviets' 
willingness to offer their own ' 
opinions that differ from official 
lines. 

"The specialists [at the confer-
ence] were quite remarkable in 
the diversity of opinions they 
were willing to express and the 
disagreements among them they 
were willing to air before the 
Americans," Roeder added. 

Lakoff also observed the 
Soviet participants' willingness 
to openly debate issues among 
themselves. "For example," 
Lakoff explained, "a Soviet 
general, through an interpreter, 
told me he had previously 
represented his country in 
Geneva for arms control and 
made statements he really didn't 
believe in since he took the party 
line. 

"When he came home and 

showed the ~peech to his daugh-
ter, she cried: 'What are you 
doing to us? Why are you leaving 
us with these terrible weapons?" 
Lakoff continued. "He said 
that he felt ashamed, but now 
that the new thinking is in place, 
he doesn't have to lie or take 
positions he doesn't believe in." 

Although glasnost encour-
ages increased discussion be-
tween the Soviets and the 
Americans, significant dis-
agreements remain. 

"Most participants agreed it 
will be difficult to achieve agree-
ment at the Vienna conventional 
arms negotiations between 
NATO and Warsaw Pact nations 
in several months," Sweedler 
explained. 

Lakoff, however, is optimistic 
that "within the next couple of 
years, an agreement is possible. 
With the INF treaty as a prece-
dent, it should be possible for 
both sides to agree to offsetting 
reductions in Europe with in-
spections to guarantee them. I 
think that it is in conventional 
weapons reduction that Gorba-
chev sees the biggest opportun-
ities for saving money, which 
would then be used for the 
civilian sector." 

The Institute on Global con-
flict and Cooperation plans a 
follow-up conference for 
September 1989 in a neutral 
European country.

From the beginning of the pro-
cess, it is the UCSA that has the 
most control over the preliminary 
selections. According to Maynard 
Dimmesdale, A.S. President and 
member of the southern sections 
nominatng committee, "The Re-
gents are always unhappy with 
the Student Regent because the 
UCSA always centers its inter-
views around the political issues 
that only concern the UCSA. I 
think the Regents want someone 
more concerned with student 
problems." 

Nominating committees from 
the southern and northern sec-
tions of the state will review all 
applicants and select those who 
will be interviewed on Nov. 12. 

The committee will choose five 
applicants from the southern sec-
tion and four from the northern 
section on Nov. 19 to go before 
the UCSA board to be inter-
viewed. 

"The student regent not only 
has to have a thorough know-
ledge base of the problems, but 
they have to have definite opin-
ions on how to solve them," said 
Mordecai Potash, A.S. Vice Pres-
ident of External Affairs. 

On Jan. 7 the UCSA wiU choose 
three students from the nine semi-
finalists to go before the Board of 
Regents for the final selection. 
Finally, Feb. 16 the Board will 
select the Student Regent.

Life in 250 '" ords 

W hy are we here? . . Is our existence accidental? Are we here as conduits of a divine will? Are we here to forge a bond between ourselves, our offspring, and other living creatures? 
Are we jusl passing time here before moving onto another existence? 
How do wefit into the pattern of chaos or order in the universe? What 
does death have to do with this? Why do we ask these questions? 

- Uffer from LIFE magazine Aug. /8, /988 

W hy indeed? Who needs that kind of sophomoric gibberish? Especially right now in the middle of this joyless presidential 
election year ... Which is almost over, by my calendar. Only 

five more days until one of these bums will disappear from our TV 
screens forever. 

Well. . . a harsh tag like "bums" is probably not fair to either one of 
the candidates. They are very different men, despite what you see on 
TV. George Bush is a treacherous swine who has never told the truth 
about anything and Michael Dukakis is a condescending little 
bureaucrat who thinks in slow motion and will end up giving both 
Harvard and Massachusetts a bad name before this year is out. 

Harsh judgments? 
Jesus. I would hope so . But this is a nervous year, and words like 

Liar and Treacherous and Bureaucrat and Slow are always relative, 
anyway - particularly in the speedy gray realm of national politics, 
where word with the specific graviiy of War and Peace or even Victory 
and Defeat can be twisted by hired wizards to mean almost 
anything ... whatever the candidate needs . 

The Bush wizards, for instance, have come around to thinking that 
maybe it's not such a bad thing for the incumbent vice president of the 
U.S. and the current 1988 front-runner to be known as a treacherous 
lying swine. It has stood him in pretty good stead with the electorate, so 
far, and there is no reason to think it might suddenly loom as a problem 
in the next five days. 

Who, after all , can say that a truthless balloon of a man like George 
Bush should not be president of the United States at the moment of 
historical apogee for this admittedly unique generation? 

Why not? Jimmy Swaggart was honest , and look what happened to 
him . He got crucified by addicts and traitors in the liberal press - just 
like J im and Tammy, and Oral, and Bill Casey, and Tawana Brawley 
and all the others who dared to reach too high ... Look at Ivan Boesky: 
Two years ago he was voted the "most admired man" by the graduating 
class of the Business School at the University of California in Berkeley, 
and now he is in prison for massive stock fraud . Where will it end? 

Not with Ivan. His fall from grace at Berkeley was not unexpected , 
given the sudden rush of front page Wall Street Journal headlines 
about his crimes, his confessions and even his neo-public decision to go 
belly-up with the fed s and turn state's evidence against his ex-partners, 
buddies and other (as yet) un indicted co-conspirators in the business he 
had chosen .. . 

N o. The real rap against Boesky and the thing that finally brought him low in the eyes of the late-'8Os campus crowd was the news that he was never really running the operation in the 
first place, that he was only a spear-carrier for the Real Boss of the 
junkbond racket, a truly ranking fixer from the bowels of Beverly Hills 
named Mike Milken, who made Ivan seem like an amateur when it 
came to rapid stockholders ... 1t was a matter of status . The original 
maze of fraud charges against Boesky made him so chic that he 
appeared instantly on the cover of Time magazine with a triumphant 
smile on his face .. . 

It was not until he was exposed asjust another yes-man for the really 
smart people that his image turned sour and even the children of his 
ex-peers started to laugh at him. 

Not even George Bush would return his calls after that. He was like 
Ben Johnson stumbling through Seoul International Airport like a 
common criminal ' after the Olympic Committee stripped him of his 
gol!! medal when he failed a routine urine test for steroids. Not even his 
bodyguards wanted to be seen with him .. . 

A few hours earlier they had been swollen with pride and power after Ben blew Carl Lewis away and got an incredible new 
world record in the 100 meter dash ... But shit happens, like they 

say in Phoenix, and it happened to Ben in a hurry. 
Boesky went the same way. One day he was champion swine, and the 

next day he was just another lame pig. Easy come, easy go ... 
Ed Meese said that, but where is he now? 
In England , I think - honing up for a brutal confrontation with me 

on BBC-TV in about to days, and the Brits have warned him not to 
carry any personal weapons or firearms into the studio when our time 
comes.

Letters 

Hitler Is 
No Joke 
Editor: 

This letter is addressed to a 
little man who on Halloween night 
of 1988 was doing his best to 
resemble another little man. (Com-
plete with mustache and swastika). 
I believe that a brief lecture on 
world history is in order. 

Twenty two million people died 
as a result of the little man's 
dreams of conquest and "racial 
purity." Six million of those dead 
were Jews murdered for the sole 
reason of being Jewish. 

~ . -

This is a very personal subject 
to me. You see, my grandfather 
died in the Nazi death camps, and 
my mother barely survived their 
terror. The Nazis almost destroyed 
the world that we, in the U.S., 
stand for : a world in which people 
have rights that are self evident. 

Therefore, I am addressing this 
to the one, whoever he might 
be, who on Halloween night of 
1988 saw fit to dress as the Nazi 
warlord Adolf Hitler. 

BUSH'S ACHIL.L.ES HEEL. 

In my opinion you might be 
one of several things: 

You might be ignorant beyond 
measure. ignorant to the fact that 
the crime has been committed or 
ignorant to the fact that the U.S. 
fought and shed its blood fighting 
the evil Nazi empire. 

You might be one of those who 
believes in "white power," and if it 
is so, all I need say is that your 
grandparents who fought the evil 
forces of Nazi Germany will 
probably pale in disgust at lhe 
thought of their own flesh and 
blood donning the hated enemy's 
uniform. 

And so for whoever you are, I 
have nothing but contempt. Alii 
can do is state my contempt for 
you publicly and hope that we are 
aU accountable in the end.

Endorsement 
Misses Mark 
Editor: 

I see that the Guardian has 
endorsed Lt. Governor Leo 
McCarthy for the position of U.S. 
Senator from California. (Oct. 
17) 

Except for one brief sentence 
describing McCarthy as "a tradi-
tional Democrat especially strong 
on legislative politics, the environ-
ment and entitlement programs," 
you did not describe his votes, 
positions, or thoughts on any of 
these o<jmportant" topics. How 
can one endorse a candidate as 
"the man who will address [these] 
problems," without relating his 
views on these few narrow, state-
wide concerns?

The '88 Election 

Spread 
6 States· 

Underdog 
Dukakis 

PHIL'S ANALYSIS .. . I realize that this may be a 
touchy issue to some, but I really didn't want anybody 
heading to vote without a deep understanding of the 
issues: The likeliness of Dukakis pulling out a victory 
is about the same as Joe Watson lifting the alcohol 
policy. Face)t Democrats, Dukakis doesn't have 
much of a chance. The reason? It's obvious. If I can 
recall correctly, in the last election Reagan obliterated 
Mondale 49 states to I. Now I know Dukakis isn't 
Mondale, but I'm assuming most of those who voted 
for Reagan are also going to vote for Bush. Dukakis 
will surely put up a better show than Mondale, but the 
Republicans are going to have to wait until '92 to see if 
the Democratic Party can put forth adequate compe-
tition_ Bush should easily cover the six state spread, 
and may only fail in some small, helpless New 
England states. Put your money down on this one, 
'cause the chances are very slim that I'm going to blow 
it twice in a row. Therefore . . . 

TAKE BUSH 

college political science courses 
relate the general duties and 
responsibilities of the office of 
U.S. Senator. Voting on bi-parti-
san issues such as declarations of 
war. approval of arms-control 
treaties, ratification of national 
budgets, and the appointment of 
U.S. Supreme Court Justices are 
all under the purview of the U.S. 
Senate. 

Perhaps in an earlier time (pre-
WWI), college age voters could 
reasonably be expected to base 
their votes for U.S. Senate candi-
dates on such specific statewide 
issues mentioned in the editorial: 
regulation of off road vehicles. 
student loans and table grape 
boycotts. 

However, in an age when college 
students and all Americans are 
faced with the threat of nuclear 
war, the possible collapse of the 
U.S. and world economic system, 
and the gross racial and class 
inequalities that exist in America 
and the rest of the world, I 
sincerely hope enlightened voters 
will look beyond the sketchy 
endorsement of the "traditional 
Democrat" Leo McCarthy and 
try to research the respective 
candidates in other local media 
and make their own decision.

Reader Gives 
'Fresh' Ideas 
EdJtpenon: 

Th,. L.A. Times says you have 
decided to replace the word fresh-
man withfreshperson unless some-
one can come up with something 
that sounds better and does not 
call women men. 

I believe "fresher" is a slang 
term used in English public 
schools; check out "Goodbye, Mr. 
Chips" or "Tom Brown's School-
days." Also, my unabridged dic-
tionary gives me "frosh"as a siang 
term for freshman . 

Now if we can only come up 
with a better replacement for 
chair-mantllan clulirperson. Chair 
is unacceptable; it doesn' call 
women men, but it calls people 
furniture, which in my book is 
worse. Any idea,?

Losing Sleep 
Over Alarms 
Editor: 

Have you ever been awakened 
by a fire alarm at five o'c1ock in 
the morning during the week? 
H ow a bout the weekend? Once or 
twice, maybe, right? However, if 
you are a resident of Building Two 
in the Warren Apartments you 
have been awakened by a fire 
alarm five times within the last 
two weeks. 

Besides being a major hassle, 
how does the University expect 
students to study well and be 
attentive in class when they are 
forced to wake up extremely early 
due to a false fire alarm. You 
would think that with the fees we 
pay, the maintenance department 
could keep the alarm in working 
order. and make sure that it is 
functional only when there is an 
actual fire. Nevertheless, the 
alarm goes off whenever it wants 
to. 

The main point I am concerned 
with here is why Building Two was 
not built with a detection system 
which would tell where the fire 
alarm was set offin the first place. 
Each time the alarm sounded, the 
fire department showed up, along 
with the University police, and 
checked to make sure there was 
no fire on every floor. 

I know it is good to check, but 
after three false alarms, you get 
the feeling there's no fire. The fire 
oepartment would be better off 
staying away and going to fight 
real fires . And how do cement 
blocks burn, anyway? A fire would 
be contained in one apartment, 
with little chance of spreading. 
Evacuating the entire building 
seems a bit much. 

Another thing that concerns 
me is where our expensive apart-
ment fees go. There must be some 
sort of maintenance portion, as 
the Warren Apartment landscape 
is solidly upkept during the week. 
Hopefully, more of our money 
will go to fixing the fire alarm 
than to cutting the grass inces-
santly. I personally would rather 
sleep soundly all night and have 
tall grass outside the apartments 
than wake up at five 0 'clock in the 
morning for a false fire alarm and 
sit on the freshly cut wet grass. So 
I am making a plea - please fix 
the fire alar~ in Building Two!

RACE: Candidates Make Accusations charges. Sadly, that doesn't come out during the campaign, only

"Thi is going to be an injection

On another issue, Kripke 
claims Lower has not been a

anti-environmental record . 

According to Kripke , Lowery

I'm working to re olve conge tion 
on our freeways. the seW'lge 
problem in Tijuana and San 
Diego. and I will continue to 
work on these problems," Lowery 
said. 

A It hough Krip ke lost to 
Lowery in 1986, he believe his 
chances have improved thi year 
due to the surfacing of charges 
indicati ng Lowery accepted il-
legal campaign funds . 

These allegations, Kripke says, 
have linked Lowery to Don R. 
Dixon, who is accused of looting 
Vernon avings and Loan of 
Texas in a billion-dollar thrift 
institution failure. 

Kripke said that a complaint 
he filed with the Federal Election 
Commission stating Lowery had 
received illegal corporate contri-
butions prompted Lowery to 
return $4,000 to contributor. 

Sources inside Lowery' cam-
paign counter that Dixon' $4,000 
contribution was accepted a a 
completely legal and personal 
contribution. 

If the fund had been obtained 
illegally it was not known to 
Lowery, campaign officials said. 

"Our approach has 
been to ignore the 
opposition and not to 
give ar:1Y legitimacy to 
... mudslinging." 

-Bill Lowery 
Lowery said that the Federal 

Election Committee has ruled in 
his favor when complaints have 
been filed against him in the 
past, and said that Kripke will 
deliberately file complaints right 
before an election in order to 
create controversy that cannot 
be resolved until the election is 
over. 

"Every time the FEC has ruled, 
I have been exonerated of the 

aid . "It' a tactic that has been 
continually used and has con-
tinually failed." 

Lowery aid Kripke's failure 
in the last election how that 

an Diego voters are weary of 
negative campaign tactics . 

"Our approach has been to 
ignore the opposition and not to 
give any legitimacy to that kind 
of character assassination and 
mudslinging," he said . 

Kripke's campaign ads have 
focu ed on Lowery's connection 
with Dixon . 

The Democratic challenger has 
circula ted cartoon booklets por-
traying "Lowdown Lowery" as a 
loathesome villain opposed to 
health research, women's rights 
and abortion . One campaign 
slogan reads, "Lowery took stolen 
loot - Give him the boot!" 

Kripke d efended his ad cam-
paign, saying that "America is a 
wonderful country where a per-
son can challenge a corrupt 
government official." 

Lowery countered that 
Kripke's campaign tactics cheap-
en t he political process and that

" He's a shrink who need a 
shrink. J feel sorry for him . He 
has spent well over $100.000 of 
his own money and he gets 
clobbered," Lowery continued . 
"The Democratic party rejects 
his mudslinging style ." 

Kripke said that , despite his 
success as a phsychiatrist and 
educator, he is seeking federal 
office because he i deeply con-
cerned about education, women's 
right and national security. 

"I've spent my life helping 
people, and Lord knows our 
country needs help," he said. 

Kripke, who has spent 17 years 
at UCSD, said his family has 
been very supportive of his 
campaign and that being in 
politics has involved a lot of 
personal sacrifice on their part . 

"My wife and I havc been 
happy at UCSD and we have no 
wish to leave except for the 
greater re ponsibility of helping 
our country," he said. 

Both Kripk e and Lowery 
emphasized the importance of 
the issues to voters and the need 
for students to get out and vote

Holocaust Survivor Hunts 
Nazi War Criminals 

By ADAM LEVY 
Staff Writer 

"When history looks back. I 
wam people to know the Nazis 
weren'r able 10 kill millions and 
get away with it . . , 

- Simon Wiesenthal. 

Simon Wiesenthal, revered 
Jewish Nazi-hunter and winner of 
countless awards, including the 
congressional medal of honor, 
will be speaking at the Main Gym 
Monday in what promises to be a 
poignant and inspiring ta lk and a 
warning to fu ture murderers that 
the human spirit endures and is 
eventually triumphant aga ins t 
victimizers of humanity. 

Relatives Murdered 

Wie enthal is a man intimate 
with history and a man with the 
extreme courage to face those 
that have performed unspeakable 
evil. He ex perienced Hitler's 
concentration camps and, when 
released in 1945 from a concen-
tration camp in Mauthausen, 
Austria , was 36-years-old and 
weighed only 90 pounds. 

Soon after, with 89 of his 
relatives murdered, he began his 
life-long work of tracking down 
those responsible. 

He began his work with the 
U.S. Army War Crime Office 
and immediately e~ out to gather 
information and evidence on Nazi 
atrocities. 

In 1947, he began what many 
would deem his greatest accom-
plishment, the creation of the 
Jewish documentation cente r in 
Linz. Through it, he has worked 
closely with the governments of 
the United States, Israel, West 
Germany, and Austria in provid-
ing information that has led to the 
arrest of more than 1100 Nazi war 
criminals. 

PUTSuil 

His most famous pursuit was 
his search for Adolph Eichmann 
of the Gestapo who was responsi-
ble for arresting Anne Frank in 
he r hidden a partment in Holland. 
In 1953, Wiesenthal found out 
that Eichmann was living in 
Buenos Aires, Argentina. 

By working in close conju nc-
tion with Israeli inteUigenceforces, 
Wiesentha l had Eichmann arrest-

ed in May of 1960. Eichmann wa 
found guilty of rna s murder and 
executed a year later. 

Not Bitler 

Although Wiesenthal's life has 
been dedicated to keeping the 
memory of the Holocaust alive 
and punishing those responsible, 
he is not a bitter man. It is his 
respect for tife that drives him and 
his hope that the world will learn 
from its lessons and never again 
allow ignora nce and genocide to 
be carried to their final conclusion. 

Wiesenthal is wary of compla-
cency and warns that anti-semi-
tism and racism are still alive 
today. In a recent lecture in 
Heidelberg, Germany, he warned 
of the eighty neo-nazi groups that 
exist in Germany, the U.S ., 
A ustria and Canada. These radical 
extremists are just waiting in the 
gallows, he said, for economic 
despair when they can make 
political gains. 

Could there be another Holo-
caust? "Of course. When it can 
happen in a culturally rich and 
intelligent nation like Germany, it 
can happenanywhe·re in t~e world. 
I will not exclude any country," 

L 4.' •• rr~ 

Simon Wiesenthal survived death camps in the-~ ':Iocaust and works 
to bring war criminals to justice. 

Wiesenthal told USA Today. For 
this reason, his center in Linz 
keeps track of neo-nazi activities 
throughout the world. 

His Life 

Born in 1908, in the city of 
Buchach, Poland , Wiesenthal 
grew up in an anti-semitic world . 

He received a degree in archi-
tectural engineering in 1932 from 
the Technical University in 
Prague, and seemed headed for a 
successful career. His life, like 
millions of others, was severely 
altered with the implementation 
of Hitler's final solution in 1938. 

At the age of80, in his cramped, 
stuffed office in Linz, he continues 
his pursuit of Nazi war criminals. 
West Germany has a file of 160,000 
that have not been caught and 
thousands more are not even 
listed. 

Among his many accomplish-
ments, Wiesenthal is also a writer 
and has published several books 
that deal with keeping the memo-
ries of the Holocaust alive , the 
most famous being Murderers 
Among Us. 

Television Series 

His life will be documented in 
an HBO four-part series this spring 
caUed "The Life of Simon Wiesen-
thai ," starring Ben Kingsley. 

Kingsley, who gave an Oscar-
winning performance in "Gandhi," 
was amazed at Wiesenthal's energy 
and dedication. He said that 
Wiesenthal was unstoppable, "like 
a tank." 
Responsibility 

Wiesenthal , however, puts his 
role in life in a less exalted light 
and calls it his respon ibility to 
the world. 

" I think I am one of the last 
witnesses. And a last witness, 
before he lea ves the world, has an 
obligation to speak out. My work 
for half a lifetime is to inform 
people. My work is a warning for 
the murderers of tomorrow." 

Tickets for Wiesenthal's lecture 
are available at the UCSD box 
office and all Ticket Master outlets. 
It will be on Nov. 7 at 8 p.m. in the 
Main Gym. The cost is $9 for 
general admission, $8 for senior 
citizens and $5 for students.

Comm Students Unionize 
By TAMARA MUHONEN 
Staff Writer 

D uring spring quarter of 1988, a collective group 
of communication stu-

dents decided they'd had enough. 
"We were upset with the way 

that the communication depart-
ment was running their registra-
tion process," explained senior 
Kimberly Bixler. "A lot of students 
were being left out, and we were 
having to wait in lines as early as 3 
a.m. just to obtain a department 
stamp in order to get into a class!" 

Serving on the faculty for this 
department, however, are a mere 
15 permanent faculty mem-

bers, with three visiting professors 
who mayor may not be hired 
after this year 

The hiring of faculty is based 
on a tool known as the Penner 
Ratio , which shows the ratio of 
faculty to students in course . 
Since the 1986/ 87 academic year, 
the Penner Ratio has grown from 
1.04 to 1.27 - a large increase, 
according to Dan Hallin, acting 
communications department 
chair. 

set up the Communication Student 
Resource Center, located in the 
Media and Communication Cen-
ter, operating from Professor 
Michael Cole's office. Here. com-
munication students can seek. 
advice and obtain information 
concerning graduation require-
ments, petitions, information on 
add / drops, and can obtain. as 
Mankita stated, "practical advice 
about the professors and how to 
get past the bureaucracy of the 
system. " 

Also located in the Resource 
Center is a communication refer-
ence library and a computer which

is available for student use. .--------------------------

As a collective body, the group 
functions as a support group for 
the communication students. 

Since the union's initial forma-
tion, the registration situation has 
improved, largely due to the 
installment of T-Reg. But "some 
people are still left out," Bixler 
said. 

According to Bixler, who serves 
on the steering committee for the 
union, one of the group's major 
concerns centers around a short-
age of certain necessary communi-
cations classes. 

"The way the classes are set up, 
there aren't quite enough classes 
for those who need them," she 
added. 

The communications depart-
ment is currently the largest under-
graduate program on campus, 
boasting approximately 935 stu-
dents, with an average annual 
growth of seven to eight percent.

Steering committee member 
Isaac Mankita said, "We have a 
certain number of students, and a 
certain number of faculty required 
to teach a certain number of 
classes. Those classes are not 
enough." 

"In addition," he continUed, 
"the faculty, like the faculty at any 
university, is concerned with its 
research." 

"There needs to be a better 
balance, not only for the students, 
but also for the faculty, so that 
they can further their education 
and concentrate on their research 
as well," Bixler said. 

As a collective force, the union 
wishes to address the issues result-
ing from the growth of the com-
munication department. Though 
it is a relatively new institution, 
the results of its efforts are already 
apparent in a number of areas.

In addition to its function as a 
support group, CS U operates as 
forum and voice for communi-
cation students. Representatives 
attend department-wide open 
course group meetings, and also 
produce a communication student 
publication, dealing with their 
concerns, opinions, and depart-
ment related issues. 

"We want the students to have 
a voice. That is our major role. 
CSU operates as a support group 
and a voice for the communication 
students." Bixley explaine~1. 

"But," she continued, "a handful 
of us can't do it alone. We want 
others to get involved ." 

CS U membership is open to all 
communication students, but in-
put and questions are welcomed 
from any member of the student 
body. Questions and concerns

The TritoDJ ()842) have been OR • roU of late (eiaht 
CODICCUtive wiaa) but have not faced Macaetor' (10-1-4) this 
season. In fact. the only competition UCSD baa ICen outside of 
California this vear came from Nazareth CoUeae (NY) on 
Oct. 14 in a pme which the Tritons won convincinaly. 3-0. 

On the other band, the Tritons have faced both of the other 
teams in the Rqional earlier this year. playinl Cal St. Stanislaus 
(12-4-I)toa 3-3 tie in Septemberand clippina Claftmont-Mudd 
(I S-3-2) by a 1-0 score just over a week ... 

"We don' really know bow lood Macalester is," assistant 
coacb Rod Cramblit mentioned durina a phone interview. "But 
we do know that if we win [apost Macaleater J, then we're JOina 
to have a toulh lame whoever we play on Sunday. Stanislaus 
surprised us back in September. We didn'l expect them to be tbat 
lood." 

The Tritons suffered a near disaster a week alO ",hea loaJic 
Brian Siljander went down with a shoulder injury in the pme 
.,.iost Claremont-Mudd, but were fortUUlely able to reactivate 
Greg Stadler to take his place. Stadler has ftlled in niedy. 
recording three consecutive shutouts in the last three p.mes while 
maJcing a number of excellent saves. 

According to Cramblit. the UCSD defense, headed by Scott 
Hyver and Scott Goodman, has been especialJy strong oftate. On 
the year, the defense allowed the squad to record an unbelievable 
16 shutouts, including seven in a row heading into Saturday's 
match up. 

AtteDdaoce for this weekend's ReJional could be a determinilll 
factor as to whether or not UCSD (assuming a Midwest-Far 
West Regional Championship) will host the Quarterfinals next 
week and/ or the Nationals the followina week, as weJl as 
affecting the chances UCSD has in being selected as a host site in

Women 's Soccer Finishes Undefeated at 17-0-2 

Ca/Poly Plays Tritons To Scoreless Tie 
By CHRIS ZAHARIAS 
Staff Writer 

FoUowing directly in the foolsteps 
of the men's team, the UCSD 
women's soccer team also finished 
the season without a defeat , 
playing Cal Poly-Pomona to a 
scoreless draw Monday at Wilrren 
Field. 

The shutout helped the women's 
squad (18-0-2) become the first 
UCSD women's intercollegiate 
team to finish a single season 
undefeated, an extraordinary feat 
considering that the Tritons, in 
addition to playing tough Division 
III schools, compete with several 
Division II schools as well as an 
occasional Division I squad. 

Having barely beaten them 1-0 
on the road earlier this year, the 
Triton women knew that the Cal 
Poly-Pomona Broncos would not 
roll over and play dead. Therefore, 
they immediately drove hard 
towards Cal Poly's goal, but were 
denied when aggressive headers 
by Heather Mauro and Felicia 
Faro off indirect kicks missed just 
above the post. 

After the Tritons' initial out-
burst, however, it was clear that 
the learns were evenly matched. 

During the first two quarters, 
the Triton offense was blessed 
with many scoring opportunities, 
but nevertheless was driven back 
by the Bronco defense, especially 
by imposing defender Shelonda 
Paul. 

Eventually, Paul's aggressive-
style play sent Mauro to Scripps 
Hospital for observation after a 
hard collision in the second period 
left Mauro lying stunned on the 
ground. 

Coach Brian McManus said 
afterwards, "I thought we did 
well. We just had some unlucky 
shots that bounced off the post or 
were just a little bit high, but their 
defense played a good game also." 

Following scoreless regulation 

W,att 
Junior Teresa Schwaar (4) distributed 12 assists this year 

play, the teams went into two 15-
minute overtime sessions, which I 
again produced nothing more than 
a bevy of close calls for both sides. 

In the first overtime, UCSD 
took a shot on goal with the Cal 
Poly keeper out of the box, but 
the ball sailed just over the post. 

At UCSD's defensive end, three 
consecutive corner kicks by the 
Broncos led to some suspenseful 
shots that nevertheless would not 
fall . 

The play of the game, however, 
occurred midway through the 
second overtime when Faro 
headed a ball that was two feet 
from being a goal. This play kept 
the Tritons on track for an 
undefeated record and their fif-
teenth shutout of the season. 

The shutout also helped set a 
positive tone for Saturday's up-
coming Western Regional match 
against St. Thomas of New York, 
to be held in St. Paul, Minnesota. 

Should the Tritons defeat St . 
Thomas, their next opponent will 
either be St. Mary's of Minnesota, 
the same team that ousted the 

Tritons in the first round of post-
season play last year, or Cortland 
State of New York, a team which 

played UCSD to a 1-1 tie in a 
fierce battle during last year's 
regular season.

The chances for the UCSD 
women's volleyball team hosting 
the NCAA Division III Far-West 
Regionals improved Tuesday 
when the Tritons crushed Point 
Lorna Nazarene 15-7, 15-6, and 
15-10 at the Triton Pavilion. Dee 
Dee Bigelow led the top-ranked 
Tritons with 14 kills. 

UCSD plays Cal State L.A. 
here at 7 p.m. Friday night, and 
will probably host the Regionals 
next weekend. Regional pairings 
will be announced Sunday night.

THE MEAT 
This past weekend was the final wr.ek of the flag football regular 

season. In a key battle between two undefated teams, THE MEAT 
made just that of the ailing CUNNING LINGUISTS by shutting 
them out 12-0 to take first place in their division_ After a scoreless 
defensive struggle in the first half, The Meat got their offense on 
stride by mounting two impressive scoring drives, while still 
keeping up their stingy defense in between and holding on to win. 

Good luck to all of you who made the playoffs and 
congratulations to The Meat, THIS BUD'S FOR YOU!

It has been said that nothing soothes 
the heart IIkeJazz.1t has also been said 
that nothing stln the soul like reggae. 
Combine the two, and the human 
body Is subject to a captivating sense 
of musical ecstasy. This weekend, UCSD 
will be exposed to the best of both 
worlds. 

Promising that this year's annual 
UCSD Reggae Festival will outshine 
last year's successful yet prematurely 
ended event, A.S. Commissioner of 
Programming, Jonathan Judaken 
has organized one of the most auspi-
cious Irneups In recent memory.

The event will commence at noon 
this Saturday and will transpose the 
normally sports oriented Mile-High 
Field Into a scaled down replica of a 
Jamaican community festival. 

Before the day Is completed, UCSD 
will have played host to an array of 
trinket and food vendors, and five of 
the most locally and globally respected 
Reggae acts around. 

Starting off the show will be a 
succession of three of the West Coast's 
finest bands, Brave NewWorld, Jawge 
and the Unknown Band, and San 
Diego favorite, the cardiff Reefers. 

As the sun starts to set and the lights 
slowly come on, one of reggae music's 
most lively bands will take the stage. 
The Internationally famous Babylon 
Warriors will cause even the stiffest of 
audience memben to get up and 
dance.

But it is one man ~o will bring 
the house down at this year's 
Reggae Festival. Often called the 
father of modern reggae music, 
Jamaica's own Joe Higgs will cap 
the bill. Higgs will come to UCSD 
to recite songs from his new album, 
"Family" and songs he used to 
play while touring with the likes of 
Bob Marley and the Wailers and 
Jimmy Cliff. Mentor and teacher 
to Bunny Wailer and Peter Tosh, 
it is UCSD's honor to be hosting 
one of the greatest reggae musicians 
of all time. 

Equally or perhaps more exci-
ting is the return of the treasured 
UCSD Jan Festival. Moving this 
year from its old location at 
Stonehenge Field to the grander 
Mile High Field, this ye.ar's Jan 
Festival will far surpass any of the 
past festivals. 

The four hour event will begin 
at 1 p .m. on Sunday with dis-
tinguished local fusion ensemble, 
Easton West, featuring extraordi-
'nary guitarist Hank Easton. Fea-
tured extensively on KIFM's "San 
Diego Artists" show, Easton and 
the remaining six members of 
Easton West promise to provide 
UCSD with an exciting introduc-
tion to their work. 

Following Easton West will be 
one of the hottest recording and 
live acts in contemporary jan 
today, Skywalk. Since their forma-
tion in 1980 in Vancouver, Can-
ada, Skywalk has seen their first 
two albums soar up Billboard 
Magazine's Jazz Charts. Based on a 
strong reliance on guitar, bass, 
percussion, and saxophone. Sky-
walk's unique emotionally moving 
style has made the band a sizeable 
contender comparable with fellow 
greats, Spyro Gyra and Steps 
4,head.

The first time I saw Midnight 
Oil was in the summer of 1985. 
They were touring the States as an 
opening act for UB40.1 was caught 
unaware. 

Instead of playing the bland 
sort .of reggae I was expecting, a 
huge machine-like bald man 
appeared and began to thrash 
gyratingly about the stage bel-
lowing lyrics that seemed down-

C 

right subversive. It was interesting. 
I went out and bought the record 
the very next day. 

That was three full years ago. 
Since then, Midnight Oil has 
achieved considerable success in 
the States with their album Diesel 
And Dust and the attending hit 
single, "Beds Are Burning." 

The record is a document of the 
band's tour playing the aboriginal 
settlements of the Australian out-
back, a journey they were invited 
to make after Aborigine Elders 

Show-down with Midnight Oil this Frida, 

heard the Oils' song "The Dead 
Heart," which was later included 
on the album. The songs concern 
the plight of Australia's natives, 
their oppression and their struggle 
with the white man's culture. 

Midnight Oil are no strangers 
to leftist politics. Supporting envi-
ronmental, social, political and 
anti-nuclear campaigns, they have 
used their high visibility in the 
pop-cultural world to draw atten-
tion to Greenpeace, Australian 
anti-uranium mining and wilder-
ness-preservation groups, and 
rehabilitation and employment 
centers for Australia '5 unem-
ployed. _ 

Peter Garrett, the six-foot-five-
inch shaven-headed singer of the 
band, was only nartowly defeated 
in his 1983 bid for election to 
Australia's senate as a member of 

Study Abroad Through

the Nuclear Disarmament Party. 
(Garretr was also instrumental in 
opposing a national identification 
card and was appointed by the 
federal government to a commis-
sion to re-write Australia '5 consti-
tution.) Needless to say, the band's 
music carries strong social and 
political overtones. 

Diesel and Dust maintains a 
more isolated, desolate feel to the 
music than did two previous al-
bums, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5. 4, 3, 3, 1 
and Red Sails in the Sunset. The 
band relied little on production 
and digital sound-processing (a 
trademark) of the Oils' earlier 
sound) and emphasized a chant-
ing, acoustic guitar-and-drum 
sound to evoke the empty land-
scape of the Australian outback. 

It is a sound which translates 

with great impact onto the stage. 
Says Peter Garrett: "I'm tired of 
seeing rock stars get wealthy by 
indulging their adolescent fanta-
sies, disappearing with their money 
and sticking it up their nose or 
into their motorcars or whatever, 
and doing nothing constructive . . . 
we have to operate on our own 
terms or else we wouldn't operate 
at all. End of story." 

Midnight Oil will perform a 
special benefit concert at the San 
Diego State University Open Air 
Theatre on Friday, Nov. 4, 1988 
at 8 p.m. Proceeds from the event 
will go to benefit Mid-City Drug 
Prevention Program, The San 
Diego AIDS Project, SDSU 
Community Service Network and 
Minority High School Recruit-
ment.

Picture a London street where 
every place on the block has been 
sold to a developer except for one 
house filled with small studios and 
interesting inhabitants. 

Out of one window floats in-
credible piano music as the con-
struction work begins to trans-
form the block. Inside, at the 
door to one studio, an agent 
listens trying to find a new star. 
Tht' door slams in his face, and 
Shirley MacLaine, as Madame 
Sousatzka, scowls at the intrusion. 
The scene is set for the film 
Madame Sousattka. 

The film is about one woman 
helping to teach a boy to grow up 
while coping with the changes in 
her own life. Shirley Mac Laine 
has the spotlight as an eccentric 
and uncompromising piano tea-
cher who says, "I don't just teach 
piano. I teach how to live." She 
does indeed, and the subject of 
her overbearing tutelage is Manek 
Sen.

young Indian boy perfecting his 
piano, torn between his mother 
and Sousatzka. Manek was raised 
solely by his mother who is always 
scraping to get by in a small 
apartment in London, but this 
15-year-old is trying to improve 
his small family's condition. 

Sousatzka goes beyond the 
teacher's role. She slowly domin-
ates Manek's life, making him 
spend more and more time with 
her, notgiving him theopporrunity 
to help his mother. She subtly 
begins to usurp the power of his 
mother. Madame Sowattka throws a parry. 

This interplay causes conflicts 
that draw you to the characters 
and their crises: a mother who has 
invested everything in her son, 
and strives for a better life; a 
teacher who has taught many great 
pupils but usually ends up losing 
them to fame and getting left in 
the background only to hear the 
stories of their success; and the 
tenants, being of a London house 
fighting to keep their home in a 
place where modern times are 
invading. _ 

Shirley Mac Laine definitely 

steals the show in this drama that 
keeps your attention for nearly 
two hours. One problem with the 
film is that with so many subplots 
and interesting characters, it's easy 
to get lost in their different plights. 

In contrast to this, one of the 
most entertaining scenes is 
Madame Sousatzka's birthday 
party, where most of the characters 
are brought together. 

Madam Sousatzka also has flash-
backs which bring in more char-
acters and crises. The film would 

'Glass' Airplanes 

have worked more effectively if it 
had focused on only a few of these 
characters, leaving out some ofthe 
extras, instead of trying to tell 
about all of them. 

John Schlesinger's fine direc-
tion works well with individual 
scenes, but needs improvement 
in terms of bringing the stories 
together. Despite this, Shirley 
MacLaine's excellent performance 
helps to bring the many characters 
together.

Dress to Eroticize 
by isabelle tihanyi 

aeniol' luff writer 

If you are looking for an enter-
taining or inflaming evening, and 
plays about two passionate, fiesty, 
foul-mouthed erotic lesbians titi-
late your interest, than "Dress 
Suits To Hire" is the one to see. 

This play by New York's Holly 
Hughes, presented by Sushi Inc. 
on Th~y through Sunday, Nov. 
3-6 at 8 p.m., portrays the IS-year 

, love-hate relationship between 
Michigan and Deeluxe who live in 
a costume shop and change iden-
tities as easily as they change 
clothes. Living in their own fan-
tasy world, they assume bizarre 
identities including sisters, cow-
boys, twins, lovers, and a mur-
derer and victim. 

Hughes wrote "Dress Suits To 

HAIRCUTS

Hire" based on a legend in New 
York's East Village about two sis-
ters who lived together in a tux-
rental shop and frequented a seedy 
bar called "Uttle Peter's." One of 
the sisters was killed by an intru-
der. Hughes related her play to the 
myth and describes her characters 
as "outsiders, outlaws, and quasi-
criminals. " 

Holly Hughes is the author of 
The Well of Hominess published 
by Grove Press, and The lad, 
Dick. Ms. Hughes is also a per-
former and a long-time member 
ot WOW Cafe, a women's per-
forming space on the lower East 
Side. 

"Dress Suits To Hire" has been 
described as rude, politically in-
correct, sleazy, and overtly sexual.

The 16-year-old actor, Navin 
Chowdhry, who plays Manek 
Sen, Sousanka's protege, is ex-
cellent as a young boy forced to 
make adult decisions between 
conflicting loyalties. 

Actress Shabana Azmi, who 
plays Mane\c's mother, is one of 
the most famous actresses in India. 
She convincingly plays a mother 
rebelling against her son's growing 
up, while also wanting him to 
rescue her from her situation. 
Twiggy also plays a compassionate 
role as Manek's friend and secret 
love interest. 

Music, along with MacLaine, 
holds center stage. If you like 
piano, you'll love this film. The 
London Symphony Orchestra 
even has a cameo appearance in 
the film. One of the best aspects 
of Chowdhry's performance is 
that although he does not play 
piano, his mimicry is incredible. 
Yonty Solomon is the musical 
advisor and also plays the original 
piano score. 

The film touches on something 
each of us has gone through: break-
ing from our parent or parents 
and making mistakes while doing 
so. Madame Sousattka is a com-
passionate character study of how 
people cope with changes in life. 

The film began Friday, Oct. 
28, and some say Shirley Mac-
Laine will be nominated for Best 
Actress in her first film role since 
her Academy Award performance 
for Best Actress as Aurora Green-
way in the film Terms of Endear-
ment. 

Suits . 
Continued from pale 4 
Hughes follows the structure of 
films noirs and the raw energy of 
early '60s off-Broadway to ex-
plore images of women and sex-
uality. 

Stephen Holden of The New 
York Times sums it up: "The most 
striking quality in 'Dress Suits to 
Hire,' HoUy Hughes' bawdy farce 
of sexual identity, is the play-
wright'S full-tilt fire-engine lang-
uage. Like Sam Shepard, her most 
obvious influence, Ms. Hughes, 
who created 'Dress Suits' in col-
laboration with its two performers, 
Peggy Shaw and Lois Weaver, 
invents rhapsodically raunchy, 
stream-of-consciousness riffs to 
evoke characters whose multiple 
identities are straining to burst out 
of their SKins." 

Peggy Shaw began her acting 
career in 1974 as a member of the 
gay theatrical company, Hot 

Peach~s . As a member of Spider-
woman Theatre from 1978-81, 
she toured Europe and the United 
States. She has been an actor I 
collaborator of the Obie-Award 
winning theatre company Split 
Britches since its beginning in 
1980 and co-founded the WOW 
Cafe. 

Lois Weaver has been an 
actor I collaborator and founding 
director of Split Britches Com-
pany and co-founder of WOW 
Cafe. She began her career in 
feminist theater in 1975 as a 
founding member of Spider-
woman Theatre and toured with 
the company for seven years 
throughout Europe and the 
United States.

sion, $7 for Sushi members. For

Siouxsie 
by patty jettie 

hiatua writer 

"We always want to surprise 
the people who listen, as well as 
ourselves, II said Siouxsie Sioux of 
Siouxsie and the Banshees. For a 
band as complex as Siouxsie and 
the Banshees, one never knows 
quite what to expect. 

Peepshow is their tenth overaU 

album and the fourth on Geffen 
Records. Bass player Steve Severin, 
who founded the band 12 years 
ago with singer-songwriter Sioux-
sie Sioux, felt that the band had 
reached a point that did not paral-
lel their musical expectations. The 
change eventually led to the addi-
tion of two new members. Jon 
Klein, formerly of the London 
underground band Specimen, 

filled the role of lead guitarist. 
Prior to Klein joining, Siouxsie, 
Severin, and drummer Budgie 
added Martin McCarick on key-
boards and cello to the now 
quintet'S lineup. 

According to Severin, McCar-
ick was a necessary addition. "We 
needed to expand, to broaden the 
sound and give us more options. 
We had always been shy of key-
boards and strings before because 
we know we couldn't do them 
live. Performing, we weren't sure 
whether the part we were playing 
was actually for a guitar on a 
piano half the time. Having Martin 
has made a lot of difference." 

After a two-week U.S. tour last 
year, the band retired to a small 
English village to fling artistic ideas 
at each other while avoiding the 
usual hassles that confront bands 
in the big cities. 

Produced by Mike Hedges and 
the Banshees themselves, Peepshow 
is the result of the band's con-
scious effort to "strip" their music ' 
of unnecessary frills . Known for 
their outstanding B-sides of sin-
gles, they decided to conglomerate 
an entire album with that style of 
sporadic music. 

Although the songs on the 
album pOssess the band's tradi-

tional dark quirkiness,the infusion 
of sound and lyrics lead to an out-
come far different than the tradi-
tional musical mainstream. 

Accoding to Severin, there is an 
overall theme to the current 
album. "There are a number of 
ways you can write lyrics: talk 
about your own emotions; attempt 
to be someone else; or take a step 
back and look in on someone 
else's relationship and the way life 
is. II 

" We do the latter more fre-
quently on this album than ever 
before. It became a funnel where 
we put our own emotional input 
but we also watched from the out-
side - like a peep show. There's 
definitely a heavy voyeuristic ele-
ment on the album." 

Consistent with this theme of 
morbid eroticism, the album's first 
single, "Peek-A-Boo," is a hyp-
notic song dealing with soft-core 
pornography and the way society 
accepts this medium and its de-
gradation of women. 

The cuts "Rawhead and Bloody-
bones," a grisly lullaby, and 
"Rhapsody," which discussed the 
spirit of the Stalinist era in the 
Soviet Union, are merely a few 
high points off an album done in 
the extremist style o( traditional 
Siouxsie.

Walkure, The Traveler) have put 
forth a truly coll\lborative effort in 
which the three elements - the 
text, the visuals, and the music -
interweave equally to produce an 
unparalleled theatrical experience. 

The story involves a single char-
acter known only as "M.," a Man-
hattan copy shop employee, dou-
ble cast and performed on alternate 
nights as a male and female role. 
Leaping back and forth through 
time and space, the gripping mono-
logue relates the character's multi-
ple abductions by alien visitors in 
a hive-like spaceship. At first, M. 
is unable to recall the incident 
clearly; and as M. struggles to 
remember and re-interpret the 
events, M. is abducted again. 

There is no clear narrative 
sequence. Hwang's M., almost like 
Vonnegut's Billy Pilgrim, is un-
stuck in time, and the effect is one 
of exploring a fitate of mind rather 
than relating a story. 

M. 's inner struggle involves mem-
ory and the interpretation of M. 's 
own past, bringing to the fore the 
fundamental problem of identity 
in the modern world. It is a specta-
cle rich in color and sound. 

Designer Sirlin has created more 
than 200 visual environments for 
the 9O-minute, no intermission 
rooo Airplanes, ranging from 
snowy woods and city scapes to 
spaceship interiors and a hospital 
operating room. Projected on a 
series of opaque white archways 
to give an added illusion of depth, 
the scenographs make it possible 
to change sets in a split second as 
many times as required. 

As Phillip Glass has noted, the 
effect is like having a live actor 
injected into a movie. By raking 
the stage and using photos taken 
from oblique angles, the projec-
tions provide the illusion that an 
actor is climbing up skyscrapers, 
leaping avenues, entering a space-
ship formed like a meshed globe, 
and floating high above a city. The 
immediacy of such scenic tech-
nique is breathtaking.

.:. 

Glass' music, no longer as mini-
mal as it was in his operas, adds a 
powerful compliment to the text 
and visual narrative. The score, 
performed by the world famous 
Phillip Glass Ensemble, involves 
considerable melodic motion and 
richer harmonic colorings than 
have been explored by the compo-
ser in the past. It is written for 
keyboards, flute, saxophones, pic-
colo, wind synthesizer, and a word-
less vocal pan that floats above 
the instruments. 

The striking blend of Glass' 
score, Hwang's text, and Sirlin's 
visual environments are combined 
to proVide an incredible journey 
through what M. calls "the Fifth 
Dimension," - perception. And as 
the other four dimensions are 
deliberately twisted and obscured, 
the "fifth" remains the most potent 
and involving for the audience. 
There are portions of this piece 
that are likely to remain in one's 
memory long after leaving the 
theatre. 

A lOur ck force of theattical 
innovation, 1000 Airplanes on the 

~oof promises to be the highlight 
In San Diego performing arts this 
fall. 

Tickets for the Monday, Nov. 7 
production range from $15 to

The San Jose Taiko Group 
Drums Up Life

What in the world is the San 
Jose Taiko Group? 

The taiko is a Japanese drum 
which, centuries ago, was used to 
drive insects and evil spirits from 
the rice fields . In times of drought, 
the. thunder-like sounds of the 
taiko were believed to summon 
the rain spirit to produce rain. 

The taiko was also played after 
a good harvest as a form of grati-
tude to the gods. By combining 
religion and music, the taiko has 
come to symbolize the celebration 
of life. , 

The San Jose T aiko Group, 

which mostly consists of Sansei 
(third generation Japanese musi-
cians), has fused traditional 
Japanese rhythms with the more 
international sounds of Africa, 
Latin America, and American jazz. 
Under the direction of master 
Seiichi Tanaka since 1973, the 
group combines musical rhythm, 
dance, costume design, and staging 
to give a totally new, modern ' 
rendition of traditional Japanese 
folk songs. 

San Jose T aiko promotes the 
idea of creating new variations of 
Asian American performing arts. 
The group has performed with 
such players as Art Blakey and the 
Jazz Messengers, as well as the 

The San ]o!e Tiako group 

Kodo Drummers of Japan. a highly 
respected taiko group. 

The main goal of the San Jose 
Taiko Group is ro expand Asian 
American arc into the future by 
drawing from the past and different 
aspects of international art. 

The performance by the San' 
Jose Taiko Group may be a new 
experience for you. It will definite-
ly be worth the time to go and 
learn a little about Japanese culture 
through this program. 

The San Jose Taiko Group will 
be playing at the UCSD Mandeville 
Auditorium on Sunday, Nov. 6at 
8 p.m. Tickets can be purchased at 
the UCSD box office and Ticket-
Master outlets.

Now with their latest album, 
Paradiso just hitting the record 
bins, Skywalk has set out on a 
nationwide tour destined to strength~ 
en their evergrowing popularity. 
Considered a "core" band by many 
jazz radio stations, Skywalk has 
the ability to become an influential 
mainstay in the jazz community. 

Headlining the day's event is 
undoubtedly the most celebrated 

tenor saxophonist alive today, 
Michael Brecker, fronting the 
Michael Brecker band. Fresh off 
the recently completed Herbie 
Hancock/Chick Corea world tour, 
Brecker is out to support his latest 
album, Don't Try This One At 
Home." He has been awarded a 
barage of awards throughout his 
twenty year career, including last 
year's approval by several jazz peri~ 
odicals as "Jazz Artist of the Year." 

Having worked on albums by 

Michael Brecker 

artists ranging from Bruce Spring~ 
steen to John Lennon to Dire 
Straits and Steely Dan, Michael 
Bred.er has built a substantial 
reputation in the music industry. 
Setting himself apart from other 
saxophonists, Brecker has also 
been a leader in instrument experi~ 
mentalism. Since discovering the 
EWI, a wind-driven synthe~ 
sizer/saxophone that he is cur~ 
rently renowned for, Michael 
Brecker has taken conventional 
instrumentation to its technologi~ 
cal limit. Look forward to the 
Michael Brecker Band dazzling 
the audience with state~of~the~art 
jazz performance. 

The UCSD Jazz Festival is pro~ 
duced by the University Events 
Office and the Associated Stu~ 
dents. 

Both events are free, and all 
students, faculty, and community 
members are strongly encouraged 
to attend. A variety of food will 
also be sold at the events by 
various clubs and organizations. 
The event coordinators welcome 
blankets and ground covers, but 
restrict bringing in of alcohol, 
bottles, cans, cameras and record~ 
ers.
