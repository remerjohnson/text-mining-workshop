In the week following Gov. Schwarzenegger’s

mandatory increase in funding for 
higher education — prison guards and

Funding is unsure for A.S. President 
Utsav Gupta’s week-old proposal to create 
an auxiliary section of the A.S. Council 
independent from the university. 

If councilmembers approve the pro-
posal, it will be placed on the Spring 
Quarter election ballot. Gupta aims to 
create a 501(c)(3) group — an inde-
pendent, tax-exempt, autonomous orga-

nization. This subsection, called A.S. 
Auxiliary, would be affiliated with the 
university’s A.S. Council and governed 
by a majority of the same members, 
but would not be subject to UCSD’s 
departmental restrictions, such as the 
prohibition against building off-campus 
housing.

“Off-campus housing and building a 
Greek row are the key pillars of this plan,” 
Gupta said. “Over a period of 50 years, we 
can buy La Jolla real estate and build stu-
dent housing with rates we can control.”

According to VP Finance Peter 
Benesch, the plan ensures that the coun-
cil will retain its university funding and 
services. He also stressed that the A.S. 
operating budget could not fund Gupta’s 
proposed subsection.

“We looked at the budget and decid-
ed we can’t fund A.S. money into it,” 
Benesch said. “It will be a separate entity 
both in that it won’t affect council at all 

and that it will need to raise 
its own money.”

Benesch added that the 
voluntary $5 fee Gupta 
suggested as a method of 
funding, modeled after 
the dues of groups such 
as the student organization 

CalPIRG, may be unfeasible. 
“With these times and students 

strapped for cash and so many groups 
reaching for a cause, people will see this 
as just another hand extending out for

The U.S. DeparWPHQW� RI�
(GXFDWLRQ� KDV� UHYLVHG� DQG� VLP�
SOLILHG� WKH�  Free Application for 
Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) 
application for the 2010-11 aca-
demic year, making it easier for 
students to apply for financial aid. 

Among the changes to the 
newer FAFSA application is the 
implementation of “skip logic,” 
a mechanism that recognizes 
which questions a particular stu-
dent needs to answer, and elimi-
nates all unnecessary questions. 

In addition, low-income stu-
dents will no longer be required 
to answer questions about assets, 

since these questions do not 
affect their aid. Different sections 
of the application will also be sep-
arated by color, making it easier 
for users to navigate. 

Over 34,000 students 
applied for federal financial aid 
using FAFSA in the 2008-2009 
school year. According to Jake 
Stillwell, communications direc-
tor for the United States Student 
Association, the new application 
should boost the number of stu-
dents applying for federal aid. 

“Studies have concluded that 
reducing the number of ques-
tions will encourage more stu-
dents to apply, because the sheer 
number of questions have pre-
viously deterred students from 

completing the form,” Stillwell 
said.

The UCSD Financial Aid 
Office is also optimistic about 
the new application. According 
to associate director Vonda 
Garcia, the streamlined applica-
tion process will encourage stu-
dents to apply for grants and 
loans. 

“I’m happy to see the 2010-11 
FAFSA has been simplified from 
over 20 screens down to nine,” 
Garcia said. “Students will find it 
easier to complete.”

The deadline to fill out the 
FAFSA is March 2.�

A 7.0 magnitude earthquake 
hit the capital of Port-au-Prince 
Tuesday afternoon, devastating the 
poorest country in the Western 
Hemisphere.

In a CNN article, Haitian 
President Rene Preval said that, 
less than 48 hours following the 
quake, the death rate has been esti-
mated at anywhere from 30,000 to 
100,000.

“You have to see it to believe it,” 
Preval told CNN. “Lots of houses 
destroyed, hospitals, schools, per-
sonal homes - a lot of people in the 
street, dead.”

Representatives from the UCSD 
Community Law Project and the 
InterVarsity Christian Fellowship 
told the A.S. Council at last night’s 
meeting that they will spread 
awareness for the American Red 
Cross’ relief effort by tabling on 
Library Walk on Jan. 14 and 15, 
from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.

Additionally, A.S. Campuswide 
Senator Wafa Ben-Hassine drafted 
a proposal asking the council to 
allocate $5,000 in funds to non-
profit health organization Partner 
in Health.

The proposal was rejected 
after a check of the standing rules 
revealed that A.S. Council cannot 
use student fees and funding to 
donate to outside sources. The pro-

money,” Benesch said. 
He said it would be difficult to 

receive enough donations to fund the 
organization. 

“Some organizations, such as 
CalPIRG, have 10 percent of the stu-
dent body donating, but it’s not fea-
sible for us to reach that 10-percent 
threshold,” Benesch said. 

One alternate method of fund-
ing the 501(c)(3) would be to ask 
for voluntary donations from outside 
sources. 

“Interested people could donate 
to the campus,” Benesch said. “For 
example, the local community could 
contribute to this organization, or 
Greek alumni could donate to the 
cause of building a Greek row.”

This model of business has previ-
ously been implemented on cam-
pus. According to Assistant Vice 
Chancellor of Alumni Affairs Armin 
Afsahi, there is a university depart-
ment of Alumni Affairs that has a 
separate 501(c)(3) organization 
called the Alumni Association, cre-
ated in 1974. 

“Alumni Affairs is a department 

which is funded by the university,” 
Afsahi said. “The Alumni Association 
is a membership-based organization 
that has the same goals but is essen-
tially separate from Alumni Affairs.”

Afsahi said that the two organiza-
tions work very closely together and 
are integrated in most of their actions. 
The association has a separate board 
of directors, although members from 
the department usually serve on this 
board; in fact, Afsahi himself is its 
executive director. 

“The association is a member-
based legal vehicle to facilitate tax-
exempt donations from alumni,” 
Afsahi said. “Our annual and life 
dues, if donated through the associa-
tion, are tax-deductible.”

In contrast to the fiscal separation 
of A.S. Council and the proposed A.S. 
Auxiliary, Afsahi said there is one 
comprehensive Alumni Affairs reve-
nue to which the Alumni Association 
contributes.

Director of Associated Students 
Lauren Weiner said the proposal is 
in the preliminary stages — a formal-
ized draft has not been presented to 
the council. 

Before a proposal is presented to 
the A.S. Council, various require-
ments need to be cleared. Director of 
Policy Initiatives Mac Zilber request-
ed an advisory opinion from the 
Internal Revenue Services to decide 
whether the council’s lobbying efforts 
will prevent it from creating this aux-
iliary. One stipulation of the creation 
of a 501(c)(3) is that the organization 
must be free from direct political 
lobbying. 

According to Zilber, the A.S. 
Council participates in two activities 
that could be labeled as lobbying. 

The council currently pays 
$2.24 per quarter per student to the 
University of California Student 
Association, which Zilber calls the 
“lobbying arm for all of A.S.” In 
addition, the council has previously 
arranged external events, such as Fall 
Quarter’s bus trip to UCLA during 
the UC Regents meeting on Nov. 19, 
which could be considered lobbying 
because of the implied request for 
students to influence the Regents’ 
decision. 

AVP External Affairs Gracelynne 
West said she doubts these activities 

will affect the likelihood of the A.S. 
Council being able to create a 501(c)
(3) organization. 

“Our campaigns are not necessar-
ily about telling the students how to 
vote,” West said. “They’re about issue 
awareness, not lobbying.” 

If this proposal is placed on the 
Spring Quarter election ballot and 
passed by student vote, the imple-
mentation of the organization and 
elections for the board of directors 
would begin in the 2010-11 academic 
year.

According to Gupta, the board of 
directors would be fiscally account-
able for the actions of A.S. Auxiliary 
and would review the auxiliary’s fund 
usage. Appointed members of A.S. 
Council may be guaranteed a posi-
tion on the board, although another 
proposal is to open positions for local 
community members. 

A special committee to discuss 
the logistics and feasibility of the pro-
posal has been created, and will meet 
for the first time this weekend.

In light of the massive 7.0-mag-nitude earthquake that wreaked destruction on Haiti on Tuesday, 
the second A.S. Council meeting of 
the quarter revolved heavily around 
possible funding and relief efforts to 
support and aid Haiti in finding sur-
vivors and rebuilding their country. 

Kenny Pettersen, a student who 
feels passionately 
about Haiti and 
has traveled there 
seven times, 
addressed the 
council in hopes 
they would allo-
cate $5,000 to 
nonprofit organization Partners in 
Health to help fund relief efforts. 

After nearly an hour of debate, the 
council decided the standing rules 
would not allow them to allocate 
$5,000 to an outside organization. 

President Utsav Gupta reminded 
councilmembers to spread the word 
about the A.S. Council survey, in the 
hopes that it would help make the 
UCSD football team more than a far-
fetched dream. 

Parminder Sandhu introduced 
himself as the new A.S. Advocate 
General, and addressed the growing 
issue of councilmember absences.  

“I’m working on impeachment,” 
Sandhu said, though his facetious 
tone belied any real threat. 

Social Sciences Senator Irfan 
Ahmed briefed the council on a plan 
to reduce the international-studies 
major tracks. Ahmed said the plan 
would solidify major and minor 
requirements, but marginalize much-
needed diversity within the major. A 
career-services fair for social-science 
majors is also in the works. 

A confrontation at last Friday’s 
New Boyz concert — in which a 
friend of an A.S. councilmember who 
was promised entrance was denied 
when the concert reached capac-

ity — proved to be a source of stress 
for AVP Concerts and Events Alex 
Bramwell.  

“Some were guaranteed by A.S. 
councilmembers that they would get 
into the [sold-out] event, but this 
reflects badly on council and makes 
my job miserable for the night,” 
Bramwell said. 

VP Student 
Life Riscie 
Hernandez 
updated council-
members on the 
services offered 
by the Office of 
Student Wellness. 

She announced that the previously 
vacant space between Price Center 
Theater and Jamba Juice finally has a 
new occupant: the new student well-
ness center.  

It will be used as a small space 
for meetings, programming, yoga 
and meditation, set to open Spring 
Quarter 2010, she said. 

Muir senators Ryan O’Rear and 
Lynne Swerhone talked about their 
first Muirworld radio show on KSDT 
last Tuesday. A total of nine people 
tuned in — a number that elicited 
cheers from councilmembers. They 
discussed adding a “Konstituent 
Korner” segment for next week’s 
show, during which students can 
call in and ask questions about Muir 
College or A.S.  Council. The sena-
tors thought the ‘K’s gave the idea an 
extra edge. 

As the meeting drew to a close, 
Campuswide Senator Bryant Pena 
voiced his frustrations with both the 
standing rules and councilmembers’ 
reluctance to act outside them. 

“We tend to shut off ideas that 
have great potential…it is our A.S. 
and our university,” Pena said. “We 
represent the students. If we need to 
amend the rules to do whatever it is, 
then let’s make it happen.”

Researchers from UCSD and the 
University of Toronto have found 
the exact formula for facial beauty — 
down to the millimeter. 

UCSD psychology professors 
Pamela Pallett and Stephen Link, 
along with University of Toronto pro-
fessor Kang Lee, surveyed hundreds 
of students to discover a ratio of the 
most attractive female face. They 
recently published their findings in 
Vision Research magazine.

Previous research found that the 
most appealing face could be deter-
mined by digitally and mathematically 
averaging the facial features of any 
given group of people. To test this 
hypothesis, Link, Pallett and Lee gath-
ered groups of roughly 20 to 40 UCSD 
students to conduct a new experiment.

The subjects were shown pictures 
of the same white female, with altered 
facial ratios — different proportions 
between features — and asked to 
choose the most appealing face.

“In Experiment One, for example, 
there were 10 alterations to an origi-
nal face, resulting in 11 faces,” Link 
said. “These were each paired against 
each other, and subjects were asked 
to judge which face appeared more 
attractive.”

The researchers established that 
the most attractive face was formed 
when the vertical distance between 
the eyes and the mouth is approxi-
mately 36 percent of its length, and 
the horizontal distance between the 
eyes is approximately 46 percent of 
the face’s width. About 63,000 images 
were used to determine the two mea-
surements — one for eye width and 
one for the distance between eye and 
mouth — with extreme accuracy.

Link said the findings showed that 
most people have an intuitive idea of 
facial beauty.

“People have an ideal for beauty in 
their own mind,” Link said. “You can 
ask them about it, and even if they 
think they don’t know what their ideal 

is, from comparative judgments, we 
can discover what their ideal is.”

According to Link, the purpose 
of the project was not simply to find 
an equation for beauty, but to gain an 
understanding of how people decide 
what is attractive and what is not.

While Pallett and Link only 
analyzed the facial features of white 
females, they said they plan to diver-
sify their studies.

“We have done a lot of research 
with Chinese subjects,” Link said. “I 
absolutely expect the results to be dif-
ferent. Beauty is a cultural and genetic 
sort of thing.”

4 THE UCSD GUARDIAN WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG/OPINIONTHURSDAY, JANUARY 14, 2010

Looks like those picket signs didn’t go unnoticed in Sacramento after all.
In his final State of the State 

address on Jan. 6, Governor Arnold 
Schwarzenegger (R-CA) made a 
monumental announcement: Not only 
does he want to restore $305 million 
in lost UC funding for the 2010-11 
academic year, he also wants to make 
sure state-prison funding never 
exceeds that of higher education. 

It’s refreshing to know that all stu-
dents’ efforts to protest fee increases 
and budget cuts weren’t for naught. 
The governor’s aids even said the tip-
ping point for Schwarzenegger was all 
the angry mobs across UC campuses 
this year. 

But let’s not break out the celebra-
tory bottles of Andre just yet. 

First, we can’t forget these prom-
ises are coming from a leader who has 
enacted persistent slashes to higher-
education funding every year in office 
(save 2006 — his re-election year). 

Naturally, Schwarzenegger doesn’t 
want to go to down in history as the 
man who ruined the best public uni-
versity in the world. But pressing the 
“rewind” button on six years’ worth of 
comprises to education will be no easy 
task — especially not for a lame duck. 

And in reality, the governor’s 
promise is light-years from becom-
ing realized. Democrats in the state 
congress oppose his proposed cuts to 
welfare programs, and his fellow GOP 
members aren’t too fond of increasing 
university funding. 

And although Schwarzenegger 
insists that this $20 billion-lighter 
budget won’t involve raising taxes, 
he’s also counting on a $6.9 billion 
increase in federal funding to balance 
it all out, which — with the national 
economy barely treading the first 
steps of its rebound — is anything but 
a safe bet. 

In the speech, he expressed con-

tempt at the fact that, in the last 30 
years, funding for higher education 
shrank from 10 percent of the state 
general fund to 7.5 percent, and pris-
on funding has swelled from 3 percent 
to nearly 11 — an imbalance of priori-
ties if we ever saw one.

Yet he predictably failed to rec-
ognize how much of that happened 
on his watch. Since Schwarzenegger’s 
term began six years ago, university 
funding has dropped 9 percent, while 
prison spending is up 32 percent.

Now, to reverse the damage that’s 
been done, the governor has also 
called to privatize a portion of our 
prisons — freeing up money in the 
budget for higher education. 

While passing part of the prison 
system off to corporations might 
seem a good way to lighten the state’s 
load, it’s not nearly so simple. Private 
prisons contract corporations to 
watch over inmates. Like any other 
business, they’re in it for the money; 
the more beds filled, the more money 

in their pockets. What’s more, stud-
ies from other states that have tried 
privatization have shown that they 
don’t always save the state money. In 
fact, in Tennessee, the state legislature 
estimated in 1998 that operating a 
private facility was as pricey as run-
ning two public prisons.

The real reason our prisons have 
become such an expensive burden 
is that they’re so overcrowded. If 
Schwarzenegger wants to make our 
prisons cheaper for the state, he 
should start by reconsidering the 
three-strikes and drug laws that have 
bloated prisons past maximum capac-
ity.

As much as we’d like to top off our 
plastic champagne flutes and toast to 
our new friend in high places, this 
board also recognizes the governor’s 
promises are riding on a long shot. We 
appreciate Schwarzenegger’s effort to 
reprioritize UC funding, but his plan 
to privatize prisons is hardly a sure-
fire path to savings. 

So until we see a proposal that 
both drums up legislative support 
and responsibly addresses the pris-
on-system issue, we’ll remain grate-
ful — and skeptically optimistic.

A.S. president Utsav Gupta’s dream to create a UCSD football team may be 
untimely and superfluous, but at 
least a motley blue-and-gold fleet is 
something that students can wrap 
their heads around.

The latest brainchild of our over-
ambitious leader, on the other hand, 
is a mystery and a mouthful. Gupta 
wants to set up a 501(3)(c) organiza-
tion — a financially independent 
branch of student government called 
A.S. Auxiliary — run by a yet-to-
be-appointed board of students and 
community members.

Sound boring? It is. And while 
we endlessly admire UCSD’s mast-
head poli-nerd for his enthused 
devotion to taming budgets and 
committees and evil administrators 
(and for answering our phone calls 
at 2 a.m.), it’s dangerous to open up 
more fee pools and accountable seats 
— especially when all those expected 
to pay and govern aren’t particularly 
interested.

Especially dangerous considering 
Gupta only has two quarters — and 
shrinking — to make a sovereign 
A.S. subsector something his succes-
sors care about, let alone understand.

It does sound pretty sweet to 
bust from university ties like a pack 
of tax-exempt renegades. Under the 
auxiliary branch, A.S. Council would 
be able to provide services the uni-
versity currently prohibits it to offer, 
like off-campus housing.

Thing is, land purchase in La 
Jolla is the only example Gupta and 
Co. can seem to muster. Particularly, 

upon which to raise a frat row. 
(Come on — if we wanted to be 
San Diego State, we would have 
just elected Adam Teitelbaum last 
spring.)

Not that affordable student hous-
ing isn’t practical. And it’s nice to see 
Gupta making good on another of 
his campaign promises, which hasn’t 
exactly been a trend in council his-
tory. 

But funded solely by a voluntary 
$5 quarterly fee Gupta is propos-
ing, he says this auxiliary branch 
wouldn’t be able to purchase the land 
until maybe 50 years from now. Yet 
that’s only if a full 10 percent of the 
student body — clueless to its pro-
posed purpose — agrees to pay. And 

who’s to say appointees in 25 years 
won’t decide there’s something more 
pressing on hand — say, a giant 
meteor hurtling toward Earth — and 
apply student fees toward that?

This would be one of those fees 
that hoards of students end up pay-
ing while very few reap the benefits, 
and very far in the future. A.S. Vice 
President of Finances Peter Benesch 
agrees it will be almost impossible to 
raise the amount of money needed 
to accomplish much anytime soon, 
and thinks it more feasible to hit up 
fraternity and sorority alumni to 
help us realize any dreams of Greek 
housing.

A 501(3)(c) organization is not 
inherently a bad idea; it would avoid 

taxes on whichever fees or donations 
did end up there, and could serve 
as a nifty middle finger to counter 
the administrative iron fist. But even 
if Gupta can convince the student 
body to vote it into existence on the 
A.S. ballot next quarter, the auxiliary 
branch will ultimately open up one 
more avenue for A.S. negligence.

There are already mountains 
of perfectly good abandoned com-
mittees and fish-netted proposals 
waiting in the wings of Price Center 
East for someone to take responsibil-
ity. Creating a brand-new mini A.S. 
council — even a lean, mean budget-
ary bad boy like this one — may be 
less important than maximizing the 
capabilities of the old.

QV���,
Rotting mounds of garbage don’t typically capture my attention for too long. They 
tend to smell bad, they attract shifty-
looking sanitation workers and I hap-
pen to be terrified of raccoons. It’s not 
that I don’t appreciate the large-scale 
impact of garbage or the importance 
of how it affects our planet’s ecosys-
tem — I just don’t think it’s anything 
particularly remarkable to look at.

“Avatar” was the exception.
Billed as the next generation of 

filmmaking, “Avatar” was in fact one 
of the most monumental heaps of 
garbage ever to appear in theaters. It 
was shallow. It was repetitive. It had a 
storyline that blended the worst ele-
ments of “Pocahontas” with the best 
elements of “Captain Planet”. 

But god damn if it wasn’t the pret-
tiest piece of garbage I’ve ever seen. I 
was captivated. I’ll even go so far as to 
say that I liked it. And that scares me.

While I’m not usually one to play 
up the cultural significance of over-
hyped, big-name blockbusters, it’s 
impossible to ignore the impact that 
“Avatar” is likely to have on the film 
industry, and on the development of 
our Internet-fed collective conscious-
ness. “Avatar” is much more than just 
a bad movie with good special effects; 
as the second highest-grossing film 
in history, it’s a sign of the times — a 
poorly scripted testament to the rap-
idly evolving nature of what intrigues 
us. And, by the looks of it, what 
intrigues us is a whole lot of crap. 
Glossy, digitally enhanced, multimil-
lion-dollar crap.

To be fair, that’s pretty much 
always been the case. Never before, 
however, has so mindless a film 
gained so much critical acclaim. 
Scene for scene, the plot of “Avatar” is 
roughly on par with that of a lesser-
known Disney movie. But we all 
liked it. A lot. Mainly because it was 
the coolest-looking thing any of us 
has ever seen. It was a rollercoaster, a 
spaceship, a dramatic warping of our 
immediate surroundings. The theater 
ceased to exist. We were in another 
world.

Unfortunately, that world was 
plagued by idiotic dialogue, shame-
lessly employed stereotypes and 
heroes we secretly hoped would die. 
And that’s why “Avatar” — with its 
exceedingly superficial plot line, its 
stunning lack of character develop-
ment and its near-unparalleled box- 
office success — is a perfect example 
of how our young, Web-minded 
generation — perpetually grafted to 
smart phones and jacked into social-
media networks — likes to get its 
kicks. 

It’s becoming more and more 
evident that what we want is instant 
gratification, pretty pictures and 
non-stop visual stimulation. We don’t 
want to think. We don’t want to read. 
We don’t want to be challenged, nor 
made to question what’s before us. 
Instead of lengthy newspaper articles, 
we want quick one-line summaries. 
Instead of complex back-stories, 
subtle character traits and thought-

provoking narratives, we crave a 
relentless barrage of 3-D bullshit. We 
want the immediacy of Twitter, the 
pornographic thrill of YouTube. We 
want color. We want action. We want 
it now. And it’s making us stupid.

There’s not much we can do 
about it, though. At this point, our 
unyielding drive toward complete 
digital idiocy has gained far too 
much momentum for any sort of 
effective reversal. We’re bound to 
grow ever more infatuated with 
technology, ever more impressed by 
mind-numbing feats of artificial visu-
alization, ever more dependent on 
our computer-generated intellectual 
crutches. Hearing my peers — the 

majority of whom I had assumed to 
be at least partially capable of intel-
ligent thought — praise the film for 
its brilliance is heartbreaking. The 
worst part is that I pretty much agree 
with them. 

But why? Why have I fallen prey 
to this epic piece of crap? Must I 
now commit hara-kiri, the ancient 
Japanese suicide ritual? Will the act 
of slashing open my abdomen and 
repeatedly stabbing myself in the 
throat be enough to cleanse my tar-
nished soul of this “Avatar”-induced 
stupidity? And how long will it take 
my roommate to get the blood stains 
out of the carpet? 

These aren’t the sorts of ques-
tions I like to ponder following a 

Monday-afternoon matinee, but 
ultimately, that’s what we’re all faced 
with. “Avatar” has forced us to come 
to terms with the extent of our social 
decay. We don’t need it to make 
sense, we don’t need it to make us 
think — it just needs to look good. 

Maybe the DVD release will help 
break our trance. Without its kick-
ass visual facade, after all, “Avatar” 
is going to look a lot like a bottom-
rung Pixar flick. It’ll be like seeing an 
average-looking girl without makeup 
for the first time, or like walking onto 
the set of “Sesame Street” and real-
izing that Elmo is just a sweaty nerd 
with his hand up a puppet’s ass. For 
now, though, we’re stuck — hope-
lessly fixated, relentlessly entertained.

Dear Editor,
Last week, in his annual State 

of State address, Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger stated: “Because 
our future economic well-being is 
so dependent on education … we 
can no longer afford to cut higher 
education.” Overall, in the context 
of deep and painful cuts to so many 
valuable programs, the governor’s 
budget proposal was a win for higher 
education.

In the current economic climate, 
it would be comforting to still have 
affordable, high-quality education, 
but unfortunately, our competitive 
advantage is vanishing. Think tanks 
estimate that California needs about 
55 to 60 percent of our population to 
be college-educated to compete econ-
omies with other states and nations 
in 2025. We expect that about 45 
percent of California’s population will 
complete a higher education — mil-
lions of degrees less than we need to 
even meet our own requirements for 
skilled workers.

Graduates from our 110 com-
munity colleges could be a big part 
of the solution, using their skills and 
knowledge to repower our economy. 
However, only 24 percent of commu-
nity-college students who intend to 
earn an associate’s degree or transfer 
to a four-year school are successful in 
doing so within six years. This is very 
troubling; we simply can’t afford for 
so many community-college students 
to fall through the cracks. 

It’s well-known that community-
college fees are low — but less well-
known is the fact that fees comprise 
only about 5 percent of the total 
attendance cost. So to make ends 
meet, most community-college stu-
dents work. A recent CalPIRG survey 

found that students worked an aver-
age of 23 hours per week, leaving 
themselves too little time to focus on 
academics. This is no small problem 
when three out of five community 
college students are underprepared 
for college and need remediation. 
They have to focus on academics if 
they are to succeed.

To buy back some of those work 
hours for study, community-college 
students need more financial aid. 
Part of the solution is to make sure 
that all students understand the 
basics of financial aid and have the 
help they need to navigate the pro-
cess. 

In this respect, Schwarzenegger’s 
budget, which suspends all new com-
petitive Cal Grants, was troubling. 
These grants are already limited in 
number: Last year, 245,400 quali-
fied applicants competed for 22,500 
grants. 

Of course, community-college 
students face many challenges in get-
ting to graduation, but working so 
hard that they can’t make the grade 
academically should not be one of 
them. We need to make sure that stu-
dents know how to apply for the aid 
that is available and continue to fund 
the programs that enable low-income 
students to earn degrees. Why set 
students up for failure when so much 
is riding on their success?

I t’s not too far-fetched to say I’m maniacal about comics. I grew up with them, and at the moment I 
pretty much live and die by them.

So when I explain my passion to 
curious onlookers, I’m always a little 
surprised when they tell me they’ve 
never read a comic book before. The 
reasons are always diverse: For some, 
it’s that comics are daunting — the 
moment they read a page, they’re over-
whelmed by visuals and don’t know 
where to begin. Others find the content 
immature, or the emotional conflict 
within superheroes silly and unrelatable. 

Whatever the reason, I feel it’s a big 
misunderstanding. Since I am of the 

opinion that comics can be just as ful-
filling as any other storytelling medium, 
I want to use this opportunity to discuss 
the fulfilling ways one can approach 
and interact with comics.

Assuming you’re reading from a 
physical Guardian instead of the online 
version, I encourage you to walk to the 
nearest bookstore (UCSD’s included) 
and cozy up to the comics/graphic-
novels section. If this is your first time 
’round these parts, there’s a good chance 
your eye will immediately fall on the 
shelves of Marvel and DC compilations 
— or a large body of books with num-
bers on their spines.

Say ‘Hello’ to the two biggest enti-
ties in comics: Western superheroes 
and Japanese manga. Take a moment to 
get acquainted. Now, grab a comic that 
catches your eye and continue reading 
this column before glancing back at said 
comic. Are you ready?

At first impression, the comic page 
is indeed daunting. There are lots of 
images and words, both large and small 
— trust me when I say I understand 
your pain. But if you’re still with me, I’m 
here to help. First thing to note is that a 
comic page is a lot like a poster, only a 
fourth or eighth of the size. Accordingly, 
you should read the page as you would 
read a poster: from top to bottom.

Now, depending on if you picked 
up a Western or Japanese comic, you’re 
either going to be reading from top left 
to bottom right, or top right to bot-
tom left, respectively. But it’s OK — the 
method of reading rarely changes. 

The way you interpret a comic, 
however, depends entirely on the way 
it’s presented. Comics, like every other 
medium, come in a variety of genres.  
For example, Dave Gibbon and Alan 
Moore’s groudbreaking Watchmen 
mostly used a 9x9-panel page layout — 
reflective of the familiar yet objective 
tone of the comic. It’s not hyper-stylized 
nor glamorized; the grotesque nature 
of the comic is presented in the most 
informational manner as possible.

In a popular Japanese manga like 
Naruto — which, unlike Watchmen, is 
highly fantastical — the comic is pre-
sented playfully, as is typical of other, 
similarly lighthearted mangas. There are 
even comics like Scott Pilgrim, which 
contain young-adult subjects like work 
and dating, yet are presented in fantastic 
styles so as to make the reading acces-
sible and fun.

There are, of course, more left-field 
comics like Prison Pit — wherein the 
content and presentation both reflect the 
chaotic, psychotic and disturbed nature 
of the comic. If you’ve picked up some-

PREACHY WILD WESTERN SHOOTS BLANKS

By Jenna Brogan
Associate Hiatus Editor

A fter a nine-year hibernation, twin directors Albert and Allen Hughes (“From Hell”) are back 
to make their mark on Hollywood. 

Too bad that mark is an unpleas-
ant stain. Known for films laced 
with social critique, the brothers 
make no exception with this year’s 
postapocalyptic western: a righteous 
slap on the wrist for 21st-century 
consumers. 

To start, we meet Eli (Denzel 

Washington), a man who — much 
like Cillian Murphy in “28 Days 
Later” and Will Smith in “I Am 
Legend” — appears to be the only 
person left on the planet.

Rather than making his way 
through the unscathed streets of 
London or Manhattan, however, 
Eli is trekking across what’s left of 
middle America, reduced to rubble 
by a war of human self-destruction 
and the subsequent obliteration of 
the ozone layer. 

But Eli is not nearly as helpless 
as you would think. Upon his first 

encounter with pillagers — yes, 
there are in fact many other people 
surviving in this dust bowl — we 
discover that not only does he pos-
sess superhuman senses, but he can 
wield a chainsaw-resistant samurai 
sword like nobody’s business.

With untouchable ninja skills 
that would make Neo bow down, 
Eli creams any and all vigilantes 
who stand in the way of him reach-
ing the West. 

While anyone from California 
knows that the West Coast is where 
it’s at, you may be wondering why 

this particular iPod-toting anti-
hero has his heart set on the Pacific 
Ocean. Drumroll please: In Eli’s 
possession is a sacred book that 
holds the secrets to mankind’s salva-
tion.

Which book, you ask? I’d tell 
you, but then I’d have to kill you. 

The only other person on the 
ravaged frontier who recognizes the 
power Eli carries — and is deter-
mined to obtain it by any means 
— goes by the name Carnegie (Gary

A ural voyeurs of the world, rejoice: Wall-of-sound afi-cionados Asobi Seksu are 
stripping down in every sense 
of the word. After six years per-
forming in a trippy haze of heavy 
distortion, thick reverb and guitar 
layered upon guitar layered upon 
guitar, Asobi released an acoustic 
album this December, reinterpret-
ing the sonic collages that gave 
them their fame. And come Friday, 
they’ll bare it all for the Loft.

This is perhaps appropriate 
for a band whose name trans-
lates to “playful sex,” and whose 
lead singer coos such suggestive 
oddities as “put your tongue to 
my battery” (that is, when she’s 
not cooing her unimaginables in 
Japanese). Asobi has pared them-
selves down from four mem-
bers to two: The only survivors 

are pixie-like lead singer Yuki 
Chikudate — whose otherworldly 
siren’s pipes make it hard to 
believe she hails from SoCal — 
and instrumentalist James Hanna. 

The removal of excess bag-
gage  is starkly apparent on new 
studio album Hush — released 
last February — and Rewolf, 
December’s full-length of acoustic 
self-covers. The title of the former 
seems a direct order for those who 
pigeonholed Asobi as shoegaze

HIATUS� THURSDAY, JANUARY 14, 2010� THE UCSD GUARDIAN�7

When the “Chicago 8” Vietnam War activists, the inmates that took over 
Attica prison and the American-Indian movement needed representation 
during the ’60s and ’70s, they looked to William Kunstler for help. One 
of the most controversial lawyers of the 20th century, he represented 
some of the most reviled members of society — from rapists to 
assassins to terrorists. Today, his ﬁlmmaker daughters Emily and Sarah 
Kunstler bring his story to the silver screen with a biopic about a man 
— however unpopular — who believed in justice for all. (JB)

FILMREVIEW

By Amanda Martinek
Senior Staff Writer

He’s scarier than the love child of Freddy Krueger and Hannibal Lector; he’s the most unassuming villain in 
existence; he’s your next-door neighbor. The 
normal guy that prunes his roses in the front 
yard and lives alone — a million times more 
threatening than any of Rob Zombie’s twisted 
nightmares, simply because he’s a real-life 
testament to what happens when a creepy old 
man catches the scent of a young blossoming 
girl, and can’t control his perverted desires.

Based on the novel by Alice Sebold, “The 

Lovely Bones” is the haunting tale of one such 
creeper and the 14-year-old after whom he 
pines. Susie Salmon (Saoirse Ronan) is young, 
happy and healthy. She spends her days jok-
ing with her best buds, snapping photos of her 
fam and daydreaming about the class hottie. 

But that happy bubble is burst when Susie 
herself informs the audience via voiceover 
that she will soon be murdered. Immediately 
after her admission, the film takes a dark 
turn — and every scene that follows will cause 
an anxious nausea to creep further up your 
throat.

See BONES, page 8

T he last thing Vampire Weekend’s sophomore album Contra could be criticized 
for is a lack of ambition. The Ivy 
League foursome busted out its 
encyclopedia of instruments and 
genres and created 10 crossbred, 
expertly culled songs. 

These twacked-out hybrids 
range from dancehall to “fourth-
wave” ska, African tribal drum-
ming to Auto-Tune, indie-pop to 
deep-house synth. With so much 
overlap, the whirlwind of jumbled 
tastes could prove catastrophic 
— yet somehow the boys of VW 
manage to create a completely 
peerless, rhythmic masterpiece. 

After their preppy, bright-eyed 
debut, which included predictable 
college cuts like “Campus” and 
“Oxford Comma,” one wouldn’t 
expect the new album to reference 
right-wing Nicaraguan rebels, ’80s 
Nintendo games, a frothy Mexican 
rice drink or the text font Futura. 
But oh, it does.

Whether sampling M.I.A.’s 
“Hussel” on “Diplomat’s Son” 
or taking tips from T-Pain 
on “California English,” these 
unabashed dorks don’t conform 
to iron-starched polos and cardi-
gans no more — instead, they get 
cultured. “Run” is a flavorful, fast-
paced dance number that explodes 
in African bass drumming, Miami 
Sound Machine trumpeting and 
moments of electronic New Wave, 
even reaching Disney “Circle of 
Life” sonics at one point. 

“Cousins” begins with clas-
sic ’50s guitars, continues with 
a thrashy punk baseline and 
— somewhere in the middle — 
includes a snippet of “Wipeout” 
surf rock.

VW’s instrumental spectrum 
may range from marimbas to 
thumb pianos, harpsichords to 
synthesizers and Mariachi trum-
pets to jittery guitars — but the 
heartbeat of Contra is its percus-
sion. Every track has an essence of 
rapid-fire snare, a deep thudding 
bass, tribal claps, congas and shak-
ers or a dancehall dub — keeping 
this LP faster and fancier.

 Rostam Batmanglij’s produc-
tion skills are leagues ahead of 
the first release, with riffs that 
jump and bump where “Oxford 
Comma” and “Cape Cod Kwassa 
Kwassa” sailed by unadorned. And 
the electronic tinge on every cut 
lends a sense of new weirdness 

that the boys must have always 
been working towards. It portends 
a rich career ahead with overt pre-
tension, a scholar’s eye inspiring 
the work and genuinely peculiar 
results. One imagines singer Ezra 
Koenig donning a monocle in his 
study as he pores over academic 
papers in one hand, underground 
mixtapes in the other. It’s a haugh-
ty and privileged image, but intel-
ligence and chops go a long way.     

Uncovering meaning from 
the dense, obscure lyrics after 
one listen is challenging, if not 
impossible. Even after Googling 
the correct words (and searching 
“balaclava” on Wikipedia), grasp-
ing what the hell VW are getting at 
is no easy task. But Contra is worth 
the time and patience — in a gen-
eration of one-click-away informa-
tion, everyone can access a page of 
answers. So what happens when 

four Columbia grads get greedy 
and want to do it all? Gorgeous 
sophomore sprawl.

thing this wacky, then — for the purposes of 
this walk-through — I encourage you to put it 
back on the shelf and pick up something a little 
easier to follow.

Once you’re finished, sit back and take a 
moment to reflect. Whether or not you realize 
it, you’ve actually gone through a bit of work.  
See, in a comic, you invest a certain portion of 
your own imagination — as opposed to, say, 
a film, where you simply receive and interpret 
what’s being handed to you. A comic is interac-
tive and subtly different for everyone, despite 
the fact that we see the same images and read 
the same texts. This is because images, by their 
nature, are emotional stimuli. They evoke 
visceral responses. And words, by nature, are 
logical stimuli, interacting with your sense of 
reason. The combination creates both harmony 
and conflict, because emotion and reason — 
though intrinsically linked — rarely go hand 
in hand.  

Let’s say that, in one panel, a woman is 
slowly brushing her hair, and immediately in 
the next panel exists a single bubble that says, 
“Hi…”.  Given these two panels, we could say 
that the woman is seducing someone with the 
brush of her hair and the trail of her word.  

Or, we could say that she’s just woken up 
and is brushing away her ruffled hair to say 
hello sleepily to a friend. Or, maybe these 
panels mean absolutely nothing, and are 
provided merely to place context of a given 
situation.  Point being: Image of the woman 
provides context by invoking a particular 
emotional reaction, and the text will pro-
vide a translation for said reaction. Because 
everyone’s experiences differ, the reaction to 
the comic will be different for each reader. 
Assuming you’ve read the comic properly 
and its actually somewhat decent, you should 
be feeling something.

Now that you’re familiar with the comic, 
notice that comics, like every other medium, 
come a variety of genres. Everything from 
noir to indie, to musical to social and politi-
cal — it’s all there. You can find a comic on 
anything, so long as you look properly.  Some 
are easier to read, some more difficult. It 
really depends on the artist. But in general, a 
worthwhile comic book should feel natural. 
It should be grand or intimate, or even both. 
A good comic book should leave you feel-
ing fulfilled. If you haven’t experienced any 
of this, you’re reading a crappy comic. Pick 
another. Enjoy.

Oldman), self-appointed ruler of

A testament to history repeat-

So it’s up to Eli and his newly 
recruited accomplice, Carnegie’s

from the enemy and hand-deliver it 
to safety. Along the way, Eli teaches

a thin line between action flick,

True, the final twist will throw 
even Miss Cleo for a loop. And 
“Eli” is rather striking in terms 
of atmospheric cinematography

(Stanley Tucci) lurks in the shadows 
of Susie’s carefree life, setting up each 
moment as potentially Susie’s last. It 
is during these instants of paranoia 
that director Peter Jackson shows 
off his mastery of deep screen-to-
audience tension.

As much as we wish it wouldn’t, 
Susie’s fated murder finally occurs 
one evening after school, when 
she’s walking home through a corn-
field and meets her evidently kind 
neighbor. He then lures her into a 
self-built clubhouse out of sight and 
sound, where he rapes and kills her.

Kids: don’t talk to strangers.
Cleverly juxtaposing reality and 

fantasy as Susie’s life slips out of her 
grasp, Jackson chooses to replace 
what would be a gruesome act of 
violence with a journey through “the 
in-between” — a not-quite-heaven 
magical world of vivid color and 
psychedelic imaginatives.

It is in this limbo that Jackson 
showcases the same outrageous 
special effects and supernatural ele-
ments that made “Lord of the Rings” 
a household name: Fields melt into 
oceans, seasons change when you 
turn the corner and ice sculptures 
the size of skyscrapers survey you 
from above. 

From the in-between, Susie 
desperately tries to reach out to the 
mourning parents (Mark Wahlberg 
and Rachel Weisz) she left behind, 
in hopes she can lead them to her 
murderer. 

The soundtrack provides 
“Bones” with a strong skeleton, 
adding intensity to each scene with 
heartbeat-mimicking rhythm and 
innocent skip-to-my-loo melodies. 
It also makes the film’s moments of 
dead silence absolutely unforget-
table.

Although Wahlberg shines as 
Susie’s passionate father whose 
obsession with finding his daughter 
nearly leads him to the edge of mad-
ness — and newcomer Ronan can 
say a thousand words with her eyes 
alone — their character development 
seems fairly inadequate for a story 
of such emotional turmoil. Through 
the traumatic event itself and the 
heartbreak that follows, the narrative 
never fully dives into the family’s 
struggle to cope.  

All in all, “Bones” is a chilling 
film. Lucky for us, Jackson doesn’t 
dwell on how awful and sad the 
story is, but instead focuses on a 
final optimism: In death there is new 
life, and with tragedy there is oppor-
tunity for love.

An Afterschool Nightmare in Disguise

ALBUMREVIEW

W ith a five-year gap between 2005’s Oh No and Of the Blue Colour of the Sky, Chicago natives OK Go — famous for that YouTube-hyped treadmill dance routine — left fans eagerly 
awaiting their latest release.

And they disappoint.
Paisley-clad lead singer Damian Kulash is the too-sweet anom-

aly child of the Shins and the Strokes, if Uncle Garfunkel used to 
read him disturbing fairy tales by candlelight. Needless to say, the 
band isn’t afraid to get weird — but weird doesn’t always mean 
awesome.

First single “WTF?” sees Kulash break trough the track as if he’s 
wandered into the studio after a day of communing with hippies 
and snapping his fingers in a coffee shop — surprised by the fancy 
equipment but deciding just to go with it. His satisfyingly smooth 
lyrics are layered over a mixture of electro-beats and guitar, chant-
ing, “Are you some kind of dark sorcerer/ Am I under some kind 
of spell?”

The opening cut, however, is not a harbinger of things to come. 
Blowing sexy oddities to the wind, the band veers into over-senti-
mental territory, stating the obvious — “You don’t get much dumber 
than/ Trying to forget a girl when you love her” — and comparing 
the fall of the sky to the end of a relationship. Gush. Barf.

It’s a mediocre ride all the way through — and even though 
gems like “White Knuckles” lend some funky drums and hand-
claps, Of the Blue differs leaves behind the catchy tenacity of fame-
makers like “Here It Goes Again” and finds itself in a Michael 
Bolton disco-holiday phase.

Change is inevitable, but we can’t help wishing OK Go could 
zap back to that glorious age when their indie-pop inspired tread-
mill jazzercise sessions across the nation.

which Asobi more lightly treads the reverb-free 
clouds of dream-pop than immerse themselves 
in the special effects of shoegaze — giving 
Chikudate new power behind the mic. The 
objective has switched to unfolding an epic, 
where before they focused on creating the 
woozy ambiance in which an epic story could 
unfold.

On Hush’s “In the Sky,” background sound is 
almost minimalistic — a simple beat, a keening 
guitar chord — far from the churning feedback 
of albums past. By tearing down the wall, every-
thing still here becomes more: the lyrics more 
meaningful, the sparse instruments more conse-
quential by sheer dint of rarity. 

It’s Rewolf, however — a direct preview 
of Friday’s acoustic show — that unveils the 
grandest evolutions. Their best songs stripped 
to the core, Asobi stay beautiful and reveal 
themselves as more than some exotic warbles 
hiding beneath noise pop. 

Of course, Chikudate’s lilting voice and psy-
chedelic lyrics remain — she still yowls about 
acidic attic bees on “Familiar Light” — but 
interpretation shifts radically between the two 
incarnations. In its original grungy shell, the 
song is a delirious anthem to hallucinations 
of apathy; whittled down, it is haunting and 
melancholic — like the tune from a music box 
belonging to a sad girl. 

So it goes with Rewolf, and their new live 
show. Studio tricks and complex textures in 
the past, Asobi becomes nothing more than 
Chikudate’s airy vocals set to guitar and drums. 
All tracks are slowed and sweetened, every 
word entirely discernable — unlike the glos-
solalia of albums past — rising to the surface as 
forgettably pretty guitars swirl down the glass.

NEWS� THURSDAY, JANUARY 14, 2010� THE UCSD GUARDIAN 9 

decreasing funding for prisons by 
outsourcing aspects of jail mainte-
nance to private companies. Instead, 
that money would be funneled into 
higher education, and public uni-
versities like the UC system would 
receive a minimum of 10 percent of 
the General Fund by 2014.

Schwarzenegger’s plan is a depar-
ture from the current budget, under 
which higher education receives 7.5 
percent of total state funds and pris-
ons receive 11 percent. Ten years 
ago, universities received closer to 
10 percent, compared to the peniten-
tiary system’s 3 percent.

“[Back then,] the state’s invest-
ment in a UC student was twice 
as much as it is today,” UC Vice 
President for Budget Patrick Lenz 
said. “In 1990, the state provided 
around $15,000 per student. And 
today, it’s about $7,500 per student.”

According to Lance Corocan, 
chief communications officer for 
the California Correctional Police 
Officers Association, the governor’s 
plan is not without flaws.

For one thing, he said, it intro-
duces market forces and profit as 
motivational factors in running a 
prison. He added that privatization 
would probably increase spending in 
the long run.

“It’s been proven throughout the 

experiment of privatization that cost 
savings are illusory,” Corocan said. 
“[The Governor] is trying to pres-
ent a very simple solution to a very 
complex problem — one that people 
have been trying to figure out for the 
last 300 to 400 years.”

According to UC Berkeley 
professor of public policy John 
Ellwood, privatizing prisons would 
mean contracting out to cheaper, 
non-unionized prison guards, in 
order to circumvent the pricier 
CCPOA guards. In addition, the 
policy might force the state to grant 
parolees more leeway in meeting 
with officers — reducing the num-
ber of individuals put back in jail 
after being released.

“In California, if you miss one 
appointment with your parole offi-
cer, you’re automatically sent back 
to prison,” Ellwood said. “In other 
states, you have two or three chances 
if you miss something. So, another 
way to cut costs is to take people 
[who have committed] less violent 
crimes and essentially get them on 
the street, assuming they won’t hurt 
people … If you have fewer prison-
ers, you’ll spend less money.”

By reducing prison costs, 
Schwarzenegger said he hopes to 
free up money for the UC and CSU 
systems without creating any addi-
tional taxes.

As it stands, the UC system 
received only 13 percent — or $2.6 
billion — of its funding from the 
state in the 2009-10 academic year. 
The rest came from sources like fed-
eral research grants, private dona-
tions and student fees.

The governor’s proposed 2010-
2011 budget, released on Jan. 8, 
would increase the amount the state 
gives to university by $370 million, 
to about $3 billion.

According to Lenz, the amend-
ment would provide an additional 
$1.6 billion in annual state funding, 
to be shared between the UC and 
CSU systems.

“It depends on the growth in the 
General Fund budget, so it’s hard to 
estimate,” Lenz said. “The point that 
we want to hold onto is at least the 
recognition that more money needs 
to be provided for higher education.”

According to UC spokesperson 
Leslie Sepuka, it is too early to say 
whether this additional state fund-
ing would allow for a decrease in 
student fees.

Schwarzenegger’s amendment, 
while at the forefront of budgetary 
discussion at the moment, is not 
the only recent government action 
aimed at increasing funding for 
higher education. Assembly Leader 
Alberto Torrico (D–Freemont) 
recently drafted a bill that would 

create an excise tax on gas produced 
in California, then give the revenue 
exclusively to universities.

“If you think that higher educa-
tion needs more money, there’s one 
of two ways to do it,” Ellwood said. 
“One way is to increase taxation, 
and the other way is to essentially 
get money from other parts of the 
budget.”

Such systems already exist in 
states like Texas, which uses 25 per-
cent of the revenue accumulated by 
a similar excise tax on gas to fund 
its university system. The Torrico 
Initiative — also known as Bill AB 
656 — passed in the state assembly 
on Jan. 12, and is currently under 
debate in the Senate. 

UCOP Academic Senator 
Henry Powell said that even if 
Schwarzenegger’s amendment never 
reaches fruition, it is nonetheless 
encouraging to see educational 
funding being discussed as a prior-
ity by the state. 

“When the state stops investing 
in education, it stops investing in 
its future,” Powell said. “In 2025, we 
are going to need a million more 
degrees than we are ready to deliv-
er … There’s an asymmetry there, 
between the needs of the state and 
the direction things are going. It’s a 
huge crisis.”

SPORTS� THURSDAY, JANUARY 14, 2010� THE UCSD GUARDIAN 11 

The win marked UCSD’s third 
straight five-set victory over the 
Gauchos.

Senior Erik Sierks played as setter 
for UCSD and facilitated a .368 team 
hitting average by delivering 68 assists. 
Junior Joel Davidson had nine kills and 
five digs off the bench.

After downing 53 kills at the 
competition, Fritsch has passed the 
1,000-kills mark in his career with the 
Tritons. 

“My goal is to do better than last 
year and take my team further and into 

the playoffs,” Fritsch said. “We’ve never 
made it into the playoffs. We got close 
last season, so that’s our goal.”

The Tritons will open the Mountain 
Pacific Sports Federation Jan. 13 when 
they travel to Northridge to face No. 2 
Cal State Northridge (3-0). UCSD then 
travels back to Santa Barbara to face 
No. 14 UCSB (0-3). 

The team has lost in its last four 
MPSF openers. The last conference-
opener victory was in 2004 against USC.

Readers can contact Jessy Jahangir at 
fjahangi@ucsd.edu.

Many of the day’s races were 
contested down to the final stroke, but 
none more so than the men’s 50-yard 
freestyle. Senior Daniel Perdew, for-
mer Male Swimmer of the NCAA 
Champions Meet, set a season best in 
the race, but lost by two-hundredths 
of a second.

“The [50-yard freestyle] is 
always kind of an interesting race,” 
McGihon said. “It’s whoever hits 
their start and turn [who] is usually 
going to be the one who comes out 
winning the 50, and Perdew was a 
little slow off the blocks today.”

However, more often than not, 
the Tritons came out on top in close 
races. Senior Jereme Barnett-Woods 
won the 500-yard freestyle by six-
tenths of a second with a time of 
4:41.13; sophomore Natasha Nguyen 

won the 200-yard freestyle (1:57.35) 
by less than a second; senior Todd 
Langland won the 100-yard freestyle 
(46.71) by one-tenths of a second 
and freshman Jon Masehi-Lano won 
the 200-yard breaststroke (2:07.65) 
by three seconds — despite being 
behind after the first 100 yards. 

Even with a strew of terrific fin-
ishes, junior captain Kyle Begovich 
said the Tritons know they still have 
areas to improve on before season-
ending conference and NCAA 
championships roll around.

“We have to be mentally strong,” 
he said. “Sometimes we race teams 
that are not as good, so we have to 
be mentally strong and compete at 
our level, even if it means we’re rac-
ing our own teammates and not the 
other team.”

The Tritons face off against 

cross-town rival the University of 
San Diego on Jan. 16 at Canyonview 
Pool in a showdown for San Diego 
superiority.

“Last year was a really close meet 
and we just barely won,” junior cap-
tain Anju Shimura said. “I know it’s 
going to be a good meet again, but 
hopefully we just work out hard this 
week and get through the workouts.”

Despite its home victories, the 
team has to move on to mentally 
preparing for USD according to 
senior captain Cari Cunningham.

“USD is another one of our big 
rivals,” she said. “So just like our 
meet yesterday, we have to focus 
on the day and forget about all the 
meets we’ve had in the past.”

celebratory atmosphere in the stadium 
I witnessed that day was unlike any 
I’ve ever experienced — it’s completely 
unique to the World Cup.

The latest installment, hosted 
by Germany in 2006, was especially 
unforgettable. The tournament was 
run with a measure of efficiency that 
typified its German hosts, and reflect-
ed the modern state of the sport. The 
footballing community was welcomed 
into Germany to watch the matches 
in state-of-the-art stadiums in well-
organized cities.

The players on the pitch did not 
disappoint. We came away from the 
2006 World Cup with images that 
are now indelibly ingrained into the 
hearts and minds of all soccer fans. 
The image of French footballing icon 
Zinadine Zidane — arguably the 
greatest player in the modern game 
— being sent off for his infamous 
“head-butt heard ‘round the world” 
on the Italian central defender Marco 
Materazzi will forever live on in the 

folklore of the sport.
This year, the world’s gaze will turn 

to South Africa for its once-in-every-
four year footballing feast, and the 
tournament has made history before 
the first ball has even been kicked. 
The 2010 World Cup marks the first 
time that an African country will host 
the competition, and FIFA’s decision 
to bestow the honor upon South 
Africa to host its prestigious tourna-
ment sends a greater message. The 
decision recognizes the progress the 
country has made, and provides it an 
opportunity to showcase itself to the 
world as an emerging, developing bea-
con of hope in Africa. Additionally, 
it demonstrates FIFA’s intention of 
expanding the sport in the continent, 
and recognizing Africa as an emerg-
ing footballing region.

The 2010 World Cup is effectively 
South Africa’s coming-out party on 
the world stage. So dawn your favor-
ite team’s jersey, hit the pub and bask 
in the glory that June and July will 
provide.

HOTCORNER

FRANK FRITSCH | VOLLEYBALL
The senior opposite hitter led the Tritons in kills at last 
weekend’s tournament. Fritsch smashed 53 kills, pushing 
his career total to 1,044 and making him the fourth most 
prolific hitter in UCSD history.

AROUND THE LEAGUE
With a 99-90 victory over the 
Washington Wizards, the Detroit Pistons  
snapped a 13-game losing streak — the 
longest since the team’s 1993-94 season.  
During the stretch, the Pistons lost by 20 
or more points four times.

In this tumultuous life, the only constant is change.  Everything in the modern world — from 
political theater to vacuum-cleaning 
technology — is ever-transforming. 
However, without fail, every four years, 
life grants the global community one 
single month of reprieve — an oppor-
tunity to rid ourselves of daily preoccu-
pations and join together for the single 
greatest sporting spectacle known to 
man: the FIFA World Cup.

For the last three-and-a-half years, 
fans worldwide have been forced to lay 
dormant their eager anticipation for 
the global showdown. However, now 
that 2010 is officially half a month old 
and the World Cup year is finally here, 
football fanatics worldwide — myself 
included — can hardly restrain their 
excitement for the impending pinnacle 
of the best game on Earth.

However, in this country, due to 
soccer’s lack of media attention, I can’t 
help but feel like I am one of a small 
population who view the sport for the 
great athletic contests it is — not a 
sport for cheats and play-actors.

My affinity for the sport of soccer 
began when I, like almost every kid in 
this country, joined a team in my local 
youth leagues. But, unlike most of my 
friends — so quick to abandon soc-
cer for the likes of more mainstream 
sports — my interest persevered. Since 
then it’s grown to be a very important 
part of my life.

The 1994 World Cup, hosted in the 
U.S., was the first time I could con-
sciously follow the competition. From 
there on out, I’ve been completely 
entranced by everything soccer. When 
Germany played the U.S. in Palo Alto, 
Calif., at Stanford University that sum-
mer, I was there before the marvel. 
Even at eight years old, it was impos-
sible not to goggle at the euphoric 
atmosphere that the World Cup spec-
tacle created. An amalgamation of col-
ors painted the stands of the stadium. 
Drunk German fans exchanged play-
ful verbal jabs with Americans, while 
a fervent nationalistic pride pulsated 
like electricity through the stands. The 

TRITONS COME OUT WITH A KILL
Jessy Jahangir
Contributing Writer

MEN’S VOLLEYBALL — After completing 
their most successful season in school history 
last year, the Tritons returned to action on Jan. 
7 and Jan. 8 at the 46th Annual Santa Barbara 
Invitational at UC Santa Barbara, where they 
placed seventh and picked up their first win of 
the 2009-10 season.

This year’s team is stacked with accom-
plished players like senior Frank Fritsch, 
who led the 2009 Triton team with 366 kills. 
Fritsch’s 1,044 career kills rank him fourth in 
school history. Senior Jason Spangler, who has 
totaled 1,171 kills in his career, is on his way 
to becoming the all-time career kills leader. 
He has only to best former Tritons Tom Black 

(1,268 kills) and Jim Waller (1,301 kills). 
One more player on the career-kills chart 

is junior Will Ehrman, whose 633 place him 
at 14th. Junior Phil Bannan has raked up 2,229 
career assists, placing him at fourth on the list 
of all-time career assists at UCSD. 

Prior to his injury, junior Adrian Guthals 
set the single-season record for hitting percent-
age with a .442 clip.

Going into the Santa Barbara Invitational as 
a major underdog, No. 11 UCSD started with a 
2-1 lead against No. 10 UCLA in its first match.  
However, the team ultimately lost to UCLA 
30-24, 24-30, 26-30, 31-29, 15-8. 

Over the course of the match, Ehrman col-
lected 17 kills and five digs. Fritsch had 15 kills 
and freshman Cyrus Kiani had 11; sophomore 
Andrew Kaban was right behind with 10 digs, 

and Guthals tallied four blocks. Bannan lent 
49 assists.

Despite jumping out to the quick lead, 
UCSD couldn’t capitalize in a tight fourth  
game and didn’t have an answer for the Bruins’ 
offense in the deciding game.

In their second match-up of the day, the 
Tritons lost to No. 3 UC Irvine 30-28, 22-30, 
30-26, 30-21. Spangler led the way with 16 kills. 

On the second day of the tournament, 
UCSD won its first two sets against No. 14 
hosts UCSB and held on for a 30-22, 30-27, 
29-31, 26-30, 15-11 victory. Fritsch led the 
way with 27 kills on .347 hitting. Ehrman had 
17 kills on .519 hitting and Kiani had 14 kills 
without an error on .667 hitting.

SWIMMING & DIVING  — 
Building off a smashing start to 
their  season, the UCSD men’s and 
women’s swim and dive teams came 
out with confidence on Jan. 10 at 
Canyonview Pool, claiming victo-
ries over Grand Canyon University 
and the University of the Incarnate 
Word. The men’s team defeated 
GCU 197-84 and UIW 189-109; the 
women defeated GCU 229-54 and 

UIW 220-74.
Despite their victories, head 

coach Scott McGihon said he still 
sees room for improvement in the 
teams’ mental preparedness.

“One thing we need to work on 
— and we showed that today — is 
our mental focus,” head coach Scott 
McGihon said. “It’s not where it 
needs to be. The athletes are going 
to have to figure [out] that only they 
can make themselves focus mentally. 
That’s the missing component.”

Despite their coach’s critique, the 
Tritons still pulled away with two 
solid victories over teams they may 
be facing again in the NCAA meet.

“It feels good to get the win,” 
senior captain Andy Islip said. 
“We’re charging up for conference 
championship, and so every meet is 
just more practice. We’re fine-tuning 

our strokes and techniques and get-
ting out all the kinks.”

At the meet, the Tritons placed at 
least two swimmers in the top three 
spots over 16 races, winning 20 races 
overall. The victors included sopho-
more Alex Henley, who earned a 
NCAA-qualifying time of 2:05.77 in 
the 200-yard butterfly event. 

Sophomore diver Patrick Cohen 
qualified for the NCAA tournament 
in the one-meter diving event with 
his performance.

“Getting to nationals feels amaz-
ing,” Cohen said. “This is everything 
I’ve been working toward. I feel like 
this year I was more focused. I just 
wanted to make nationals even more 
because I didn’t make nationals last 
year.”
