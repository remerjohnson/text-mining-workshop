Prop 9 Losing Heavily in Latest Poll 
Trend Just the Opposite of Wave Which Swept Prop 131n Final Weeks 

SAN FRANCISCO - California 
voters have reversed their attitudes 
on tax-cutting Proposition 9 in the 
past three months with 57 percent 
opposed and 31 percent favoring it, 
according to The California Poll. 

The poll, released yesterday, 
. constrasts with a survey three monUts 
ago in which Prop. 9 had a 20 point 
plurality in favor and only 26 percent 
against it, according to pollster 
Marvin D. Field, who established the 
independent statewide survey. 

The increasing trend of "No" votes 
on Prop. 9 is the opposite of how 
voters reacted to another tax-cutting 
measure, Proposition 13. During the 
closing weeks of the Prop. 13 
campaign, the plurality in favor of the 

property tax measure grew rapidly 
from three points to 23 points a week 
before the election. On . election day 
voters approved Prop. 13 by a 30 
point plurality. 

Voters in the latest sample were 
first asked whether they had heard 
enough to make a decision about 
Proposition 9, a measure that would 
significantly slash personal state 
income taxes. Not quite half of the 
state's voters said they had definitely 
made up their minds, while the rest 
said they wanted to hear more about 

Prop. 9 before coming to a final 
decision. 

When both groups were asked how 
they currently stood on the measure, 
those with their minds made up were 
much more negative on Prop. 9 then 
those who say they want to hear 
more, Field said. 

The major oposition to the 
measure results from fears that Prop. 
9 would cut needed government 
services and that the state cannot 
withstand another cutback in 
revenues, Field said. 

. The poU, a statewide telephone 
sample involving 1,219 reptered 
voters, found 12 percent undecided. 

Opponents of Prop. 9 fear that 
many state agencies and services, 
including the University of California, 
will suffer heavy revenue Ioaaes if the 
initiative is passed by voters in the 
June election. 

They daim that those in . higher 
income brackets will receive the moil 
financial benefit from the meaaure, 
while the average middle·da .. 
Californian will gain little or no tax 
relief. 

Supporters of the initiative feel that

Renters Rights and 
Democratic Process 
Attacked by Prop ·1 0 

BY TOM HAYDEN 
California students should oppose Proposition 10 to keep 

rents controllable , to stop the menace of housing speculation 
in the future, and to protect the ability of local governments to 
determine their own neighborhood destiny. 

Proposition 10 would eliminate existing rent control 
ordinances in cities like Los Angeles , Santa Monica, Davis, 
Berkeley and San Jose. It would erase the ability of local 
governments to pass rent relief or rent control ordinances of 
their choosing. The hard work of seniors and renters' groups 
in lobbying their elected officials would be a thing of the past. 

Any future rent control ordinances could only be passed by 
referendum, and then only within the framework of severe 
new limits that would be placed permanently in the Stale 

Constitution .

'Ask the Shah' Crossed Lines of Good Taste 
Editor: 

Just after finilhing the May 19 issue of 
The Daily Guardian, I felt compeUed to 
offer some criticism and ask the question: 
"Where do you draw the line of good ta.te 
in deciding whether or not an article 
should appear in your publication?" It 
seems you mUlt have thrown out any such 
standard for a large portion of Monday's 
edition. 

I am referring, of course, to the lengthy 
"article" (and I use the term looad.v) 
called " Ask the Shah." Thi. was 
obvioualy a .. tirical piece ba.ed mo.tly 
on politic. and .triving for humour, which 
in places was succes.ful. However, by 
and large the "humour" was very crude 

and vile, and brought back memories of 
junior high schoor contesta where the 
challenge was to see who could tell the 
most e1isgusting joke. 

I like a humorous Guardian just as 
much as the next person, but when I 
started reading abdut premature 
ejaculation and self .timulation, I began to 
wonder about the "good taste .tandards" 
which I .upposed thi. paper to have. Oh 
sure, I've been .urprised by some of the 
language used at time. in past issuea, but 
thi. i. clearly a different thing. 1he 
clincher came when I read on to be 
enlightened with the incredible humour of 
how the Shah had fed parta of his body to 
the .tarving Cambodian • . Let'. face it. 

that's nothing short of a sick and wille .. 
attempt at forced laughs. 

Now' l can see that the author of the 
piece is again.t the Shah, what he stood 
for, and the US's involvement in Iran, but 
he could have done a much better job of 
comically satirizing the situation had he 
omitted the crude.t portion. of the article, 
of which I alluded to the worst two. I've 
alway. been a consi.tent reader of the 
Guardian and hope that you, or whoever 
acreens material for the paper, will 
exercise better judgement in the future as 
to what sort of articles are in good taste 
and which are not. .

Quebec Voters May 
Ask for Independence 

MONTREAL - By the 
millions, the pebple of Quebec 
took their political future into 
their own hands yesterday, 
deciding with their vote 
whether to remain Canadian 
or to cast off on a course 
toward seceasion. 

The referendum was 
unprecedented in the two 
centuriea since the French of 
Quebec came under English 
rule. 

The early turnout for the 
historic deci.ion was massive. 

From .kyscraper.capped 
Montreal, to the walled old city 
of Quebec, to native 
seltlement. in the far north, 
Quebecer. formed long lines 
to vote "yes" or "no" to their 
provincial government's 
propos~. 

Quebec'. premier, Rene 
Levesque, and his Parti 
Quebecoia were asking for a 
mandate to negotiate an 
arrangement of "sovereignty. 
association" with the rest of 
English.speaking Canada. 

Under the plan, the mostly 
Frenc h province would 
become a polit ic ally 
independent nation, making 
all its own laws, collecting all 
taxes and establishing foreign 
relations. But it would retain a 
close economic association 
with Canada - free trade and 
a common currency, just as 
now. 

Levesque pledged that no 
negotiated agreement would 
be put into effect without being 
sulmitted to Quebec voter. for 
their approval in a second 
referendum. 

French - Soviet 
Summit Assailed 

WASHINGTON - Seae· 
tary of State Edmund Muskie 
bluntly criticized France 
yeiterday for failing to con.ult

the Sovie'ts. 

"Thi. is not conducive ... to 
the kind of mutual confidence 
and consultation which we all 

seemed to agree last week 
were essential to alliance 
solidarity and unity," he said. 

The meeting between 
Presidents Valery Giscard

Leonid Brezhnev of the Soviet 
Union was arranged secretly 
and held Monday in Warsaw. 

The French kept the 
meeting seaet throughout a

week. The United States and 
other a1liea were not informed 
until Giscard was en route to 
Warsaw, and Muskie 
indicated that he had yet to

Continued from pa~ 2 
flow of coca abroad. 

Some American assistance 
money has gone into rural 
development projects 
designed to modernize 
peasant communi tie., 
encourage the cultivation of 
other crop. for export -
rather than local consumption 
- and eventually bring a total 
ban on coca production. But 
American and Peruvian 
official. admit that any form of 
eradication is immensely 

, 

difficult because coca is grown 
on widely .scattered , small 
plots of land in the rugged 
jungle terrain. No other crop is 
as profitable or as easy to 
cultivate under su c h 
conditions, and the Andeans 
are simply not willing to 
exchange a plant with so much 
significance to their ancient 
culture for the untried benefits 
of "modernization." 

Critics charge that the 
eradication campaign will 
create an inflated black 

market for the drug, insuring a 
supply for illegal traders, but 
making purchase prohibitive 
for the peasants themselves. It 
is also probable that coca 
production in Peru, Bolivia 
and Columbia will pass even

ULeA Upset by Tritons-
BY SCOlT ALLISON 

StaHWribor 
When it comes to sports, 

UCSD always seem. to be 
operating under the shadow of 
ita lig brother to the north, 
UCLA. 

However. UCSO's Ultimate 
Frisbee team made giant 
Itridet toward rever.ing thia 
trend Sunday when they easily 
defeated the Bruin', 12·7. 

The victory was especially 
aatiafying; not only did it 

av~e an earlier seaaon 10 .. 
to UCLA, but it a110 saw the 
T ritonl dominate the action 
from the start. When the du.t 
finally .ettled, the only ones 
not surprised by the rt~.ult wu 
the UCSD telUll. 

"We knew ,oing in we 
could beat them, ' said UCSD 
captain Scott. Wilson. "It wu 
just a matter of concentrati"l 
and playing our game." 

Before UCLA knew what 
had hit them, the Tritons 
gained complete control of the 
game with a 6·2 lead . Criap

a stiDing defense carried 
UCSD past the frustrated 
Bruilll. 

Wilson teamed with Jon 
Greene, Lloyd Burgess, Rich 
Dumont and Al Lawrence to 
provide UCSO with potent 
oHen.ive fire.power, while Jon 
McGJore gave the Bruins a 
clinic on defensive aggressive 
defensive play. 

When the game ended, 
Wilson said that defeating 

in, Sports 

UCLA was no more 
meaningful than beating other 
Iquad.. But to many 
observers it was a clear 
indication that in just their first 

y~~ 01 exi~tence, the UCSD 
U1bmate Frisbee team can 
already compete with the 'big 
boys.,' 

"Sure, it was nice beating a 
powerhouse like UCLA," aaid 
Wilton. "But we've still got a 
long way to go toward 
developing consistency." 

1be Tritons succumbed to 
UCLA last month due to 
tremendous inconai.tency . 
Since the 15· 14 loIS, UCSD 
has benefited from both 
increased practice time and an 
offensive realignment that

Intramurallmertube Waterpoloat 

UCSD flu alway. had an identity 
crisi.. It'l the Rodney Dangerfield of 
the program. It gets absolutely no 
reapoect at all. Little media exposure, 
no weekly rankingl and general 
apathy from the czars has done little 
to massage the egos of the water polo· 
playing population on campus. 

Many of the sport's more avid 
participants are often caught walking 
aimlessly through the corridors of the 
Recreation Gymnasium looking fro 
reg<:ogMion. Oiad Bader, Harley 
Ba.aman, Greg Larlen, Larry 
Sadwick ... they're all the lame. AU 
asking the same question ... "Hey, 
when are you guyl goin~ to give some 
coverage to waterpolo!' 

Now that the Budman ha. 
aucasafully recovered from hi. three· 
week bout with AU·Ca!iti., it seems 
appropriate that tubers from aD over 
get their fair share of the limelight. 
After all, IT IS p1ay.off time. And for 
the 24 teams involved in the po.t· 
.... on championships" this i. a 
aerioua time. I mean, let's face it. 
Waterpolo &'::erl are aU creatures 
from the k Lagoon. Nothing 
tuma them on more than a well·timed 
dunk of an attractive member of the 
oppo.ing team. Those moments are 
legendary and get lufficient ly 
rehashed over post·garne beers. They 
aI.o get more erotic each time they 
are told. If Budman didn't know 
beUer, he'd be almost sure that the 
czars were ruMing a program of 
Intramuarl Grabboll. 

But enough! Waterpolo 
enthusialts rejoice! Here is that long· 
awaited rundown of your crazy sport: 

COED AA PLAY ·OFFS 
AA Play.offs start this Wednesday 

night with a full-lIlate of first-round 
action. Eight teams are entered and 
the difference in ability between 1 and 
8 is not that great! This tournament 
could be a real llwim meet. The 
favorite's role hall been adopted by 
last fall's ' hard-luck kidll from 
De.tiny. Their team name alone may 
be an omen for the rest of the play-
offs. Thil tearn il IIcrapy as well as 
hot. Joe Davis' group went 
undefeated in the Destroyer League 
with 5 straight winl and in the process 
knocked off the two pre-season 
favorites, Sklif and Squeaky 
Rubben. Martha Bauman" Tracy 
Dale, and Nadine Thompson do moat 
of the dirty work for De.tiny while 
Davis, AI Frowill, Mike Gibson, and 
Bob Owsley have all the fun. 

Seeded second in the single-
elimination tournament are the 
Water Bagel., a throw-together 
team that aqueaked its way put all 
five of their opponents in the very 
competitive Battleship League . 
Harley Bassman is the pilot of the 
Bagel •. He'll about as effective as the 
one that drove the Summit Venture 
into the Tampa Bay bridge. Despi~e 
this, however, the Bagels do have 
talent. Jim Agronick, Edie Conti, 
Lisa Ballance, Sunnie Landers, -and 
Steve Marx all keep the ship afloat 
with a balanced combination 01 
offense and defense. And despite all 
of the abuse that Bas.man take. from 
the 1M office, he still rales as one 01 
the toughest goalies to score against 

inthe~ Even , neither Sklif nor 
Squeaky Ru n received a to~ 
seed in the championships, look for 
one of these two talented entries to be 
there at the finish. These teams can 

definitely play. They also have the 
most experience. Sklif has all-ltar 
goal bomber Claudia O'Brien while 
the Rubben go with a more versatile 
attack that features John AIlen, 
Laurie Robson, Blake Storie, and 
Diana Dunn. Squeaky Rubben 
gave Destiny all it could handle in a 
5-4 thriller in early May, and is 
anxiously awaiting the rematch. 

Best bet for a long-shot in these 
evenly matched p1ay.oHs come from 
either Slippery When Wet or Bong 
Water. First-round pairings: 

Destiny.(S-O) vs. Slippery When Wet 
(2.3) 
Squeaky Rubbers (4-2) VI. Vertigo 
(3·2) 
Sklif (3.1) VI. Bong Water (3-2) 
Water Bagels (5-0) vs. Dungkers 
(3-2) 

COED A PLAY ·OFFS 
The usually predictable" A" Play-

offs received quite a jolt Monday 
night. Maybe not as big as Mt. St. 
Helens, but perhaps more 
devastating. Scolt Lindner's finely-
tuned polo ' machine, the Water 
Buffaloe., a team thoroughly 
dominated their division during the 
regular seallon, ran into a buzzsaw 
Monday evening in their 13-8 loss to 
an upstart Flotsam & Jetsam 
contingent. Flotsam's pumped up 
goalie, Larry Vanden Bos, (he?f the 
124-inch reach) went beserk-o In the 
goal and turned back shot after 
Buffalo shot. Jeff Barina, Rich 
Schmidt, Bonnie Linder, and Jayne 
Bronson took turns throwing in goals 
and before the Buffs came to , F & J 
had built up a insurmountable lead. 

The first-round shocker rearranges 
the dope sheet for the rest of the 
tournament as a host of 
representative " A" teams fin!sh 
preliminary action this week. Quick 
phone calls on the Bud Line to 
reputable sources in all major Nevada 
gambling casinos produced the 
foHowing "hard" information on the 
leading contenders for the Coed A 
Championship: 

Rock Lobaten (5.0) 

Greg Buchanon has a crack outfit 
primed and ready. 1be Lobsters can 
fill the goal at will. Odds: 2.1. 

Enis Penvy (4-0) 
Averaging 17 goals a game, EP also 
has the best defense in the 
tournament. Odds: 5-2. 

Priapus (5·0) 
Dave Marcos has another great 
defensive team that breezed through 
an easy Iked. Odds: 4-1. 

Flotsam &: Jetsam (4.2) 
If VandenBos walks on water in their 
next game this tearn will be tough to 
keep down O!'I the farm. Odd.: 9·2. 

Dankin'. La.t Stand (3· 1 ) 
Weinaoff, Jones & Bader are looking 
to go out a winner in their last trip. A 
Darkhorse. Odds: 8·1.

Drama/Bill Gibson 

UCSD Cast Has the Spirit 
In Baldwin's 'ADlen Corner' 

James Baldwin is one of 
very few American writers 
who has successfully bridged 
the gap between the novel and 
the dramatic form, and his 
play, Amen Corner currently 
in fine production atthe UCSD 
Theatre, is ample proof that 
his dramatic talent is at least 
equal to, and arguably greater 
than his achievements , in 
prose. Unlike his novels Go 
Tell It On The Mountain or 
The Fire Next Time,.the play is 
not a polemic. Rather, it 
explores with insight and wit 
the dilemma of men and 
women caught between the 
absolute dictates of religion 
and the necessity of living in a 
non-absolute world. 

Set in a storefront Christian 
parish in Harlem, Amen 
Corner presents the story of 
Siiter Margaret (Anasa 
Briggs) the pastor, who left her 
jazz.musician husband in 
order to find the Lord, and to 
preach His Word. As the play 
opens, she is living with her 
si.ter Odessa (Veronica 
Kemp.Henaon) and her 100 
David (Wendell J. Leonard), 
and preaching to a 
congregation of nine. The first 
act is filled with impassioned 
harangues and joyoull 
hymning, though at the same 
time the stage is set for Sister 
Margaret's fall from grace 
with the parishioners. 

The ominous tone of thill 
scene comes from her initial 
invocation to the parish, which 
has as its theme the bibilical 
quotation "Set thine house in 
order, for thou shalt die and 
not live." Just after she exhorts 
the faithful to match their 
deeds to their faith, and 
condemns one parishioner for 
driving a liquor truck, the 
audience becomes aware that 
Margaret'. own hou.e is far 
from being in order. She has 
not fully escaped her past; her 
husband Luke hal returned to 
New York, old, sick and 
dyin" and hi. reunion with the 
family lOWS the seeds of 
discord which provide the 
fickle parishioner. the excuse 

they need to oust her from her 
position. 

Anasa Briggs plays 
beautifully the sanctimonious 
Sister Margaret , filling 
parishioners and Audience 
alike with awe, chastising right 
and left, inviolate and austere 
under her vestemenls until 
finally confronted with the 
reality of her life in the last act. 
Robert Miller provides a 
co nvincing but erratic 
performance as the rasp-
voiced Luke. His entrance in 
Act I is marked by a hurried 
unnatural nervousness, but in 
Acts II and 111 he is at his best, 
filling the character with all the 
humble self-acceptance and

wisdom the world can teac . 
His llcenes with David are 
poignant . and very real, but 
because of Leonard's 
somewhat offhand characteri-
zation of David, they don't 
match the richne81 of Lukf!'A 
confrontations with his wife, 
and her breathtaking final 
admission of her love for him, 
as the hypocrites chant in the 
church above, i. the high point 
of the evening. 

All the parishioners are very 
well characterized in this 
unifonniy excellent produc-
tion but G.M. Phelps III and 
Charlotte Brown-Seward 
stand out, because of their 
talents and because of the 
roles the)' play. Phelps plays 
Brother Boxer, a church elder 
who is kept from working by 
Si.ter Margaret's iron fist. 
InitiaUy he i., like the rest, 
filled with a gregarious good. 
will, light-hearted, making wry 
comments about Margaret's 
wayward 100, but 81 the play 
prOgrelles he becomes mean 
and bitter, replacing his light-
hearted jibes with needle sharp 
dip about Ma~aret' I .. neity. 
Sisler Moore (Brown-Seward) 
i. much the same, but .he 
give. a more diabolical 

perfbrmance, retaining her 
sugar-sweet mien while 
stabbing Margaret in the back; 
between these two alone, the 
audience is shown, once 
again, how God's Word can 
be twisted to -mean anything 
one wants it to, and that for 
almost every Law there is a 
contradictory passage in the 
Scripture. At the outset, 
though, Sister Moore, Brother 
Boxer and the gargantuan 
Sister Douglass (Barbara 
Mellon ) provide much 
excellent comic relief. ' 

Another fine performance is 
that of Tina Marie Stewart 
(one of three ,UCSD students 
in this production) as the 
young mother Ida Jackson, 
who heightens the pathetic 
fallacy to tragic proportions, 
driving home the only 
"message" I found in the play; 
that prayer alone is not enough 
in this life, that it is too often a 
sanctuary from the truth rather 
than a reaching out toward it. 
This message also comes to 
Sister Margaret when it ill too 
late to do any good, and ~ her 
facade chips away, as she falls 
away from grace, from 
sanctity, the import of Amen 
Comer is brought home with 
devastating effect. 

Though aU aspects of this 
play, decor, lighting, acting 
and costuming are well-
handled by Floyd Gaffney and 
his crew, to me the true star is 
Baldwin himself. The Amen 
Comer has been disparaged 
by many.as "religious drama," 
and had to wait ten years 
before being produced 
professionally, but one could 
just as easay !,ppend the label 
"c1as.ical tragedy" to Amen 
Comer. All the unities' but that 
01 time are present, as is every 
other element, hubris, 
nemesis, the chorus. you name 
it, . it's in the play, ' It's 
impossible to say enough 
about it; for me it wu 
horrifying, suffocatinf' 
hopelell, heartbreaking y 
tragic, inescapable. Baldwin's 
text explodes with ambiguity,

The .ignificance of this 

pro-renter image by the real 
estate lobby is a major trend 
in Califomia politics: the rise 
of renters from apathy to 
become a major new, sdf-
aware constituency_ 

rent increases that continued 
even after apartment owners 
had reaped the benefits of 
Proposition 13. 

Opinion polls show a 
remarkable new support for 
rent 'control in California. 
The Fidd Poll, for in.tance 
shows 58 percent in favor 
(including a plurality of 
homeowners), and only 32 
percent against some form of 
rent control: .

were systematically preven·

college towns, simply 
because the authorities 
feared the student vote. 

The renters' movement , 
perhaps even more than the 
sate energy movement, has 
suggested a way to fight 
inflation that could become 
contagious if other solutions 
continue to fail. 

The solution is to use more 
democracy to fight price 

That's why Proposition 10 
is important to every working 
person or student anxious 
about the future in California. 
and it's why the economic 
power structure is worried 
enough to descend into 
purposeful fraud. 

Only two year. ago, for 
example, Santa Monica was 
a city languishing under 
Republican rule. ' Its 
population was 75 percent 
renter, an "unhealthy" 
balance in the words of one 
city official. Rents were 
Ikyroc:keting and vacancy 
r .. were low. 

Faced with a genuine 
renters' revolt, landlords 
have reacted with ferocioos 
dishonesty. Jarvis hal 
trumpeted loudy about' a 
"CEO conspiracy" to take 
over the .tate. Million. of 
dollars have been rai.ed for 

Proposition 13 has 
already removed the right of 
local government to control 
speculation, with almost no 
one but the authors knowing 
about it . A little noticed 
section of Proposition 13 
prohibits any new tax on 
property, which effectivdy 
means there can be no tax on 
.peculation in housing 
without a new constitutional 
amendment. Having secured 
a con.titutional right to 
'peculate, the landlord 
associations now want a 
permanent constitutional 
protection against renters' 
rights •

In their view Proposition 10 
is a way to head off the local 
renter. movements before 
they grow any stronger. The 
only way Proposition 10 can 
succeed is by a campaign of 
deception and fraud aimed at 
confusing renters and their 
sympathetic aIies among 
homeowners. 

There is an issue affecting 
all people here. When people

issues into their own hands,

Speaking on t MY SEVEN THEATERS" 



Graduate Restrictions Possible 
Con,inued from t>afle 1 

Concern over the implications of these issues 
~ ~ched the highest echelons of the 
UruVerslty . 

The Calfomia Post Education Commission 
Director Pat Callan confirmed that he had 
received a caU from UC President David Saxon 
last week regarding the analyst's proposal. "My 
impression is that the university is concerned 
because they see this as a major policy issue," 
said Callan. 

Callan said that a debate over public financed 
graduate education at a time of limited resources 
is an enonnoUi and complex policy issue that is 
not restricted to this state alone, although 
California is committed to public graduate 
education to a much . greater extent than any 
other state in the nation. 

According to Tom Jenkins, UC vice president 
in charge of the budget, the immediate effect of 
the analyst's action, if approved by the 
legislature, would possibly be to curtail UC 
graduate enrollment for 1980·81 by as many 81 
SOO. 

In the long run, it could shortchange a whole 
generation of students who wiu complete their 
undergraduate eduction in the 1980., according 
to Swain. 

"It's not wise public policy for the state to 
drutically reduce opportunities (for students to 
get a graduate education) for a period of 10 or 
15 years because of short term budgetary 
considerations," said Swain. 

In addition it could seriously undermine the 

university's reputation, which rests largely on 
graduate programs, by seriously hampering the 
university 's efforts to attract prestigious faculty. 

Many feel that the analyst is pushing for 
clarification of the issue at this time because of 
fears the university will try to compensate for the 
projected decline in under grad enrollment, 
slated to begin in the next few years, with 
graduate enrollments, thereby maintaining the 
current level of public funding over the next 

• decade. 
The first discussion of this issue will take place 

next-Monday in a Senate Finance Committee 
hearing. The battle lines will be drawn between 
the legislative analyst, who contends the 
university can and should control enrollment, 
and the university, which maintains that out of 
23,000 to 24,000 graduate student positions, it 
is not possible to calculate with complete 
precision how many students wiD eventually 
attend the university each fall. 

Gov. Brown's Department of Finance 
supports the university and believes it is acting in 
good faith, and not wiUfuUy attempting to make 
money by expanding graduate education 
positions, accoJ'ding to Dean Miller, 
Department of Finance. 

CPEC, the advisory body on whose 
recommendation the legislature tends to place a 
great deal of weight, has not taken a position on 
how many UC grad students should be funded 
next year, but is does feel the legislative analyst 
was correct in raising the question.

Baldwin has created a

Let Me Count the Ways is 
an instrumental intelJ>retation 
of the kama sulra. The band 
somehow manages to slip in a 

. sly commentary on Salt II with 
a mandolin solQ. 

While the cost of this 
186,OOO-record set (a pun on 
the velocity of light and a 
double-entendre criticizing the 
failure of US conversion to the 
metric system) may be 
prohibitive to some, the sheer 
brilliance of this endeavor is 
well worth the expenditure of 
your life savings. Suggested 
retail $1.7 million, $1.7 
million cassette. Available 
from K-Tel.
