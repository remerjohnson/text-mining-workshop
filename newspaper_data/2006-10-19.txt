Dorm 
Searches 

Restricted 
A San Jose court 
ruling binds police 
authority over dorms 
in protection of 
student privacy. 

By Serena Renner 
ASSOCIATE NEWS EDITOR 

Universities can no longer allow 
police officers to search on-campus 
dormitories without warrants under 
a recent court ruling that grants col-
lege students tenant-like protections 
that were previously withheld. 

The appeals case, which re-
appeared recently in the San Jose 
District Court of Appeals, revolved 
around the search and seizure of 
19-year-old Christopher Walker, 
a Santa Clara University student 
charged with possession of mari -
juana for sale after police officers 
collected evidence illegally from his 
dorm room. 

On Oct. IS, 2004, Walker was 
spotted smoking marijuana near 
the residence halls at SCU. After 
being confronted by campus secu-
rity officer Kim Payne, Walker said 
he smoked marijuana for medical 
purposes, then invited Payne to his 
dorm room to present documen-
tation from a medical marijuana 
club. 

While verifying the club cards, 
Payne discovered other supplies 
- such as scissors, miniature cigars 
and an electronic scale - which 
gave him reasonable suspicion to 
search further, the case stated. 

Payne eventually found large 
quantities of marijuana and $1,800 
in cash, which was handed over 
to police officer Tyson Green, who 
arrived at the scene shortly after. 

Before entering, Green asked 
Payne if he had obtained consent 
to search the room. in response, 
Payne confirmed consent but added 
that permission was not necessary 
because Walker had waived his pri-
vacy rights by signing the campus' 
housing .contract. The police then 
entered and seized the evidence. 

The most recent verdict deemed 
the police search unlawful because 
the university did not have suffi-
cient authority over dorms to grant 
third-party consent, but held that 
evidence could be used against the 
defendant - even if acquired ille-
gally -- because police would have 
obtained it from the university any-
way. 

"The case ruled that universities, 
like landlords, don't share occupan-
cy with students living in dormito-
ries, and therefore cannot provide

Housing Renovations Plagued by Problems 

HYDlf CHEUNG/CUARDIAN 
John Muir College's TIoga Hall was renovated over summer to accommodate a record 
numberoffreshmen, but hasfacedfurniture shortages and bathroom problems. 

By Christina Homer 
CONTRIBUTING WRITER 

The record-breaking 4.290 fresh-
men living on campus this year are 
settling into their somewhat-cramped 
housing situations amid complaints of 
a poorly planned redesign and lack of 
furniture, especially in overenrolled 
John Muir College and Sixth College. 

According to Director of UCSD 
Housing and Dining Services Mark 
P. Cunningham. there are 735 triple 
bedrooms across the campus this year, 
compared to only 22 triples last year. 

At Muir, Tioga Hall underwent 
a major renovation over summer to 
accomodate the large freshmen class. 
including bathroom renovations 
and new paint. carpet and furniture, 
according to Cunningham. 

"It's a long list, but it was our 
typical level of work for a major reno-
vation:' Cunningham stated in an e-
mail. 

However, some Muir students liv-
ing in the newly remodeled Tioga 
Hall are questioning the dorms' rede-
sign. Meg Gullo, a house adviser in 
the hall. has compiled a list of the 
most common student complaints 
and submitted it to Cunningham and 
other administration. 

In her letter, Gullo complained 
about the lack of shower-changing 
rooms and towel hooks that are too 

Space Race Hits Price Center Plaza 
New policy limits 
number of student 
org tables in PC 
plaza, forcing them to 
compete for space. 

By Justin P. Williams 
CONTRIBUTING WRITER 

A new Price Center tabling pol-
icy, which aims to curb the massive 
crowding of the plaza seen in the 
first few weeks of the quarter, sec-
tions off 12 8-foot by 8-foot spaces, 
rather than allowing student orga-
nizations to set up anywhere on a 
first -come, fust -served basis. 

The newly asSigned areas filled 
quickly this fall, often before 5 a.m., 
leaving several organizations with-
out space to advertise. 

[n Â·the past, organizations have 
showed up as early as 4 a.m. to 
compete for limited space and patio 
furniture. Any open area in the 
plaza, including directly in front of 
the fountain , box office and UCSD 
Bookstore, became an advertising 
area for the organizations, con-
sisting mostly of fraternities and 
sororities recruiting for their rush 
periods. Large Greek letters, some 
as tall as 12 feet, were placed on 
Price Center lawn and elsewhere 
around the plaza; stereos compet-

ARASH KESHMIRIAN/CUARDIAN 
University Centers has introduced a new tabling policy in Price Center plaza in an effort to 
relieve crowding, adhere to fire codes and limit the presence of student organizations. 
ed for airspace and fliers detailing 
rush events littered the ground. 

The new policy surprised most 
organizations arriving during rush 
period to set up tables. Blue tape 
and numbers marked off the new 
areas, with some areas reserved 
and some left open. Several orga-
nizations were unable to set up due 
to lack of space and a policy that 
bans the use of Price Center furni -
ture for events. During rush week, 
organizations resorted to several 
impromptu methods to deal with 
the new policy. including moving 
the tape and camping out over-
night. 

"The first three days [of rush) 
were bumpy; said John Payne, the 

scheduling and event services man-
ager for University Centers. 

Payne decided to implement the 
new policy to adhere to fire codes 
and address complaints from Price 
Center customers about the lack of 
space and furniture. The specified 
areas should also curb the tendel)cy 
for organizations to construct huge 
displays, taking up even more valu-
able space, Payne said .. 

"We allow it to be a free-for-all 
as a courtesy," Payne said. Although 
the new policy does dictate the 
location and amount of space avail-
able, rush week tabling will con-
tinue to be reservation-free.

far to reach from the shower. 
[n addition, the showers are much 

smaller - making showering uncom-
fortable for larger residents - and the 
fiberglass shells of the showers have 
begun to crack in some bathrooms. 

"When they made all the decisions 
on the renovations, it was, too late to 
convene a student panel:' Gullo said. 

Cunningham admjtted that he ha 
received complaints regarding Tioga, 
indicating that "the functionality of 
some of the remodeled space and 
some of the new furniture would 
describe a large portion of the con-
cerns which were brought to me and 
the need for more student involve-
ment in the renovation process." He 
said that he would be working with 
the Muir College Residents Council 
to address the problems. 

Gullo also said that the lack of 
drainage in the bathrooms causes slip-
pery floors, and only having one toilet 
paper ill penser in each stall leads to 
toilet paper shortages, especially on 
the weekends. 

"The bathrooms are one of the 
biggest problems:' Gullo said. 

Four weeks into the quarter, furni-
ture for Muir's converted triple rooms 
is still trickling in, but Cunningham 
blamed the furniture prOvider, which 
broke a contract with the university.

STUDENT 
FOUND 

DEAD IN CAR 
By Matthew McArdle 

NEWS EDITOR 

The body of a UCSD student was 
found in a parked car on Gilman 
Drive last week in an apparent sui-
cide, according to the San Diego 
Police Department. 

The county Medical Examiner's 
Office identified the student as 
Samuel Nahm, a 26-year-old 
Thurgood Marshall College junior 
from Los Angeles. 

Nahm's body was found on Oct. 
13 in the driver's seat of a white 1995 
Mitsubishi Mirage by two pedestri-
ans on Gilman Drive and Evening 
Way, about half a mile away . from 
campus, according to SDPD homi -
cide division Sgt. Pete Morales. 

The seat was reclined, Morales 
said. Because the pedestrians could 
not tell if something was wrong, 
they called the police. 

Although Morales said he did 
not see any signs of foul play at the 
scene, he said police had not ruled 
out any possibilities and indicated 
the death could also be the result of

Lawyer: Authorities Need 

Concrete Evidence to Knock 
~ WARRANT, from page 1 
the right for police to enter; UCSD 
Student Legal Services Director 
and attorney Elyce C. Morris said. 

This is good news for students, 
according . to Morris, because it 
overturns past judicial motions that 
had placed all Fourth Amendment 
authority in the hands of universi-
ties. 

The question of dorm searches 
is relatively undocumented, with 
the only California precedent, 
People v. Kelly, dating back to. 1961. 
In that ruling, the jury granted the 
university sole control over occu-
pancy, use and investigation of 
dorm rooms, placing considerable 
reliance upon housing rules. 

Instead of upholding the 45-
year-old deciSion, Walker's case 
gave precedence to more recent 
rulings that have promoted a uni-
versilyÂ·student relationship clos-
er to landlord-tenant contracts, 
Judge Richard J. McAdams stated 
at the end of the report. 

"Society and the cou rts have 
progressed from a view of college 
officials as substitute parents .. . to 
a contemporary view of the uni-
versity as an educational commu -
nity of adults:' McAdams stated. 

While the co urt decisio n 
strengthens student privacy rights, 
Morris said , it ignores another 
issue - "apparent authority." The 
term refers to someone else's perÂ· 
ception that a person has the right 
to act based on legitimate authorÂ· 
ity, as was the ca e with Payne. 

" It's an interestingly written 
decision in that they deliberately 
sidestep answering the big quesÂ· 
ti on lof apparent authority]:' 
Morris said. "Unti l they answer 
that , police officers still may say, 
'Well , we reasonably believed that 
secu rity officers had the apparent 
authori ty to give us consent to 
enter.'" 

While the written case leaves 

this query pending, McAdams 
added a "dicta:' or formal opin-
ion, at the end of the document 
that doubted the campus officer's 
apparent authority. Morris called 
the addition "enlightening." 

The case also poses implica-
tions for the way resident security 
officers regulate dorms, according 
to Morris. 

She said that as far as she is 
aware, RSOs currently lack a carn-
puswide method for enforcement 
- which may yield inconsistent 
responses. She also stressed the 
need for specific, clear reasons to 
attempt entry into a dorm room. 

"[RSOs] don't know what's hap-
p'ening behind the door unless 
they enter, or unless they have x-
ray vision," Morris said. "We don't 
live in the world of science fiction, 
right? If there's a door and you 
can't see behind and you have no 
right to open, then one could argue 
that the only reason you should 
be trying to enter is if you believe 
there is something wrong." 

She added that students should 
be able to refuse to open their 
door for law enforcement, unless 
officers have a warrant, or if some 
other exception exists. 

Morris said that she hopes that 
the ruling will lead to discussion 
about UCSD's student privacy 
policies and the training of resi -
dential life staff, security officers 
and police officers to interact with 
each other in a consistent manner 
to better uphold student rights, 
which should not be ignored. 

"[Students] are here and [they] 
should be comfortable in [their] 
homes," Morris said. "You don't 
leave your rights on the street when 
you walk onto this campus as a stu -
dent. I think it's about time that the 
law catches up with reality."

"We're waiting for an au topsy to

. iner:' Morales said. 
Morales said that he did not 

know when the autopsy wou ld be 
completed . 

This was Nahm's first quarter at 
UCSD, Marshall Dean of Student 
Affairs Ashanti Hands said. 

Marshall will provide support 
services for students who knew 
Nahm, according to Hands. But she 
said that Marshall did not have any 
direct community to target because 
Nahm was a new student, a comÂ· 
muter and had no known involveÂ· 
ment with any college organiza-

t ions. 
"Physically, we'll let the com-

m un ity dictate to us what the needs 
are," Hands said. -' 

Hands said that Q{n Â·aampus 
mental health services arc it\) tlable 
for students and encouraged stu-
dents to utilize them. . 

She also said peers of students 
experiencing mental health prob-
lems should encourage their friends 
to seek counseling. 

"We're certainly grieving and 
saddened," Hands said. "We missed 
an opportunity to connect with a 
person with such great potentiaL"

The normal policy during any

The new policy will also be in

Payne said the policy is better for

Although there are enough spaces

staff member or faculty mem-
ber, there isn't one. Through the 
program, UCSO affLiiates who 
do not purchase parking permits 
can rent a Flex Car for a free six 
hours per month, paying a small 
hourly fee after that. And as part 
of a test program at II universi-
ties nationwide, 

to convince at least a handful of 
commuters to hop the far side 
of Interstate 5 (or hop on one 
of the shuttles that run between 
the lots and the main campus) . 

Unfortunately, poor imple-
mentation may run both of these 
ideas into the ground, or at least 
keep them from flourishing the 
way they should.

Badda-bing! Lessons on Charity From 
a Public Transportation Prophet 

I was on a bus last week, con-templating th e smudges on the window and otherwise mind-
ing my own business, when 1 ran 
straight into Jesus. He was wander-
ing around the front of the bus, mut-
tering to himself, dressed in a surgi-
cal scrub top with a blue and green 
sarong wrapped around his legs. 

Now, 1 know what you're thinking. 
Jesus doesn't wear 

the kook asked. He was looking 
straight at me. 

I was unnerved by how dose his 
guess was. 

"San Jose;' I said. 
"Where's thaH" 
"It's about 30 miles south of San 

Francisco." 
"Do you like baseball?" he 

asked.

hand slightly aloft 

"I guess so," 
1 said . "Why do 
you ask?" 

" I like base-
ball;' the kook 
said . "1 knew a 
baseball player 
once. His name 
was Ted Williams. 

as if he's perpetually 
flagging down a waitress. 

Well, this Jesus didn't have any of 
these things, so even I was skeptical 
of him. He rooked and acted like a 
man with serious mental or emo-
tional problems. In fact, I thought he 
was a kook, at first . 

"I'm ... I need to see a doctor; he 
was muttering. "I don't feel very good. 
1 need to see a doctor, p[ease." 

The bus driver kept one eye on the 
road and one eye on the kook. 

"Hey. man." the driver said with 
conciliation, "Why don't you sit 
down, take it easy, huh? We'll get it 
fIXed up in a bit." 

The kook looked around as if he 
were lost, then nodded and surveyed 
Ihe bus .. I didn't avoid eye contact, but 
I didn't go out of my way to make it, 
eith~r. Did he need help? Was he a 
sociopath? It was hard to teU. 

He shuffled down the aisle and 
sat down in the empty seat across 
the aisle from me. 

Great. 
~Badda -bing, badda-boom," the 

kook babbled to himself, start-
ing straight ahead. "The bus goes. 
The bus stops. Doors open. People 
disembark. The bus starts again . 
Vroom." 

He reminded me of Dustin 
Hoffman in "Rainman." I tried to 
remember what condition his char-
acter had: Was it Parkinson's? 

~ Badda-bing, badda-boom," the 
kook said matter-of-factly, still star-
ing straight ahead. "The bus stops, 
the doors open. Badda-bing, badda-
boom." 

Autism, I remembered. It was 
definitely autism. Definitely. 

"Are you from an Francisco?" 

You 'ever hear of 
Ted Williams?" 

"Honestly, I don't know that 
much; I said . "I played ball when I 
was a kid , but that's about it." 

"You ever see 'Taxi Driver'? You 
know, De Niro?" 

,~ contemplating 
the smudges on 
the window and 

otherwise minding 
my own business, 

when I ran straight 
into Jesus?' 

I shook my head, and Jesus 
became confrontational. 

"You talkin' to me?" he demand-
ed. "You talkin' to me? I don't see no 
one else here, you must be talkin' 
to me.m 

I laughed. "I've heard the line, 
I've just never seen the movie." 

Â· You should watch it. You'd like 
it. Scorsese." . 

The kook looked around suspi-
ciously then leaned over as if he had 
some great secret to tell me. 

"My name is Jesus Christ, 
Extrr~ordjnaire." he confided. 
"Badda-bing. badda-boom." 

"I'm Nathan ." I said, shaking his 
hand . "Are YOll feeling all right? You 

were asking for a doctor, earlier .. . " 
"I feel better now;' Jesus said. 
"You sure?" 
"Sure. I'd tell you if I didn't." 
We sat in silence, looking around 

at the other people on the bus. I 
was sitting on a bus next to Jesus. It 
made me curious. 

"So ... who are you? What do 
you do?" 

"This is what I do." Jesus said. 
"This is my job." 

"The pay can't be very good ." 
"The pay is terrible; Jesus 

lamented. "I only get what people 
give me. And they don't usually 
give a whole lot. Hey, can I have a 
dollar?" 

He went in a ci[c1e from person 
to person, asking for a dollar from 
each of them. They glared at him 
skeptically or ignored him outright. 
When Jesus came to man with a 
briefcase and necktie, he stopped 
and grinned. 

"I know you have a dollar," he 
said, winking. "I' ll bet you have sev-
eral dollars." 

The man with a briefcase rolled 
his eyes and looked out the win -
dow. . 

"It's OK, you don't have to give 
me anything," Jesus told him. Â· You 
don't even have to say anything, or 
even look me in the eye. You don't 
have to acknowledge I exist." 

Jesus became philosophical. 
"You know, Nathan - it was 

Nathan, right? When 1 got on the 
bus, I looked around at all the peo-
ple, and I knew that some of them J 
would talk to me, and some of them 
wouldn't. I knew [ could talk to 
you, and that you would talk to me. 
We're following the same impulse, 
you know?" 

It seemed wise to nod. 
"But you," - and here Jesus 

turned scornfully back to Mr: 
Briefcase - "I knew you wouldn't 
talk to me. And it's not just because 
you have a tie and a briefcase. You 
think I'm crazy, but also - you're 
jealous. It makes you angry that [ 
can sit here in my crazy clothes and 
say whatever I want, while you have 
to sit there in silence, because that's 
who you are. It makes you really 
angry that I'm telling the whole bus 
about it, too. I'll tell you what: You 
can keep your dollar. I don't want 
it anyway."

Coming Up Next: Shallow, Biased News! 
With the focus on 
ratings and political 
slant, television news 
just isn't what it used 
to be. 

Jim Shen 
CONTRIBUTING WRI TER 

What do rusted nails , McDonald's 
hamburgers and modern television 
news have in common? They are all 
trash that is hazardous to human 
health . While the first two threaten 
physical health, the garbage spewed 
by television news insidiously works 
to corrupt society's capacity for inde-
pendent thinking. In pandering to 
political ideologies on the left and 
right and the quest for ratings, tele-
vision news has lost its journalistic 
credibility, mutating into mass enter-
tainment that passes itself off as intel-
lectual programming. 

With the polarization of American 
politics over the last two decades, 
television news has become little 
more than the ideological mouth-
piece for both left- and right-wing 
movements. 

Fox News, the leading cable news 
outlet, is at the forefront of media bias 
with its conservative-slanting news 
coverage. Many of the anchors on 
Fox News programs have a history of 
making unsubstantiated statements 
that espouse conservative views 
while denigrating the left. For exam-
ple, John Gibson, host of Fox News 
program the "Big Story." claimed on 
his program that "bin Laden told us 
today that our far left has been work-
ing for him ." 

Even more diSingenuously, Fox 
News has misreported and misla-
beled news items in a fashion that 
would have benefited conservative 
interests had they been true. On 
March 23, 2003, Fox News reported 

that coalition force had discovered 
a "huge chemical weapons factory" 
in Iraq when no such discovery had 
been made. More recently, on Oct. 3, 
2006, the network mislabeled former 
Republican congressman Mark Foley 
as a Democrat during "The O'Reilly 
Factor." While there is no evidence 
that. Fox News ran these misrepre-
sentations of reality on purpose, it is 
interesting that both misrepresenta-
tions benefitted the right side of the 
aisle. 

In a mirror image of Fox News. 

~ 
elevision news has 

6ecome little more 
than the ideological 
mouthpiece for both 
left- and right-wing 

movements." 

other networks such as CNN, ABC 
and CBS report in favor of the left, 
conducting their own false report-
ing and misrepresentations. In 1998, 
CNN ran a feature suggesting that 
Operation Tailwind, a u.s. incursion 
into Laos during the Vietnam War, 
was an operation to kill U.S. defec-
tors with nerve gas. Investigations 
later revealed that CNN had used 
testimony from a retired admiralliv-
ing in assisted care and selectively 
edited quotes from other sources to 
support its claims. On Sept. 8, 2004, 
CBS used allegedly forged documents 
in an attack on President George W. 
Bush's National Guard service. In an 
internal e-mail, ABC political direc-
tor Mark Halperin suggested that 
reporters should not "reflexively and 

artificially hold both sides 'equally' 
accountable." 

While the cases above are obvi -
0usï¿½y extreme examples of misre-
porting, they point toward a general 
trend of media bias. in a study con-
dueled by Stephen Farnsworth and 
S. Robert Lichter, published in their 
book "The Nightly News Nightmare: 
How Television Portrays Presidential 
Elections." Fox News favored Bush 
while ABC, CBS and NBC favored 
Democratic candidate Sen. John 
Kerry (O-Mass.) in their 2004 elec-
tion coverage. These biases directly 
influence the quality of the programs 
run on the television news channels, 
which are little more than rhetorical 
harangues by one side against the 
other. While these programs are sold 
as intellectual debate, they are in truth 
little more than entertainment. 

With the competition between 
televisioh news channels for viewers 
and ratings, each side struggles to 
one-up the other with coverage of 
breaking news and sensational sto-
ries. While this would be beneficial 
to propagating information about 
important events in a limited context, 
the current incarnation of television 
news grasps at the tiniest of events 
in an effort to gain an edge over their 
competitors. 

In coverage of the recent death 
of New York Yankees' pitcher Cory 
Lidle, major networks ran footage 
of the same burning building inter-
posed with talking heads for many 
minutes without any change in the 
situation. Similar Â·coverage" occurs 
for other breaking stories, and it 
merely amounts to the network 
announcing that something is hap-
pening and that they have no due as 
to what is going on other than what 
is visible on the screen. 

Additionally, television news 
wastes time covering events that have

Sensationalism Alive and 
Kicking on Cable TV News 

Highway Jesus Gives a Sermon on the Bus 
â¢ TV, from page 5 
little relevance to the nation at large. 
Every time a physically attractive, rela-
tively young white female goe miss-
ing, national television descends upon 
the case like a pack of vultures. Even 
though there is very little or no infor-
mation on possible suspects, motives 
or other circumstances of these cases, 
there are hourly updates on the 
unchanging situation. 

This sort of worthless cover-
age characterized the sensationalism 
surrounding Elizabeth Smart, Laci 
Peterson, Natalee HoUoway and vari-
ous other cases. "Vhile the kidnappings 
and deaths of these women are cer-
tainly unfortunate and reprehensible, 
a sensational kidnapping generates 

television coverage greater than that 
devoted to national and global issues 
such as federal elections or the war in 
Iraq. These stories, especiaUy in the 
case of murders with a suspect on trial, 
such a the Scott Peter on trial, simply 
do not deserve the amount of time 
and effort that television new spends 
in order to provide around-the-clock 
updates. 

Modern television news is a dis-
grace to the ideals of professional, 
objective journalism upheld by the 
titans of broadcast journalism such as 
Edward R. Murrow. Today's television 
anchors spit on their profession. There 
is nothing objective or professional in 
providing biased and sensational news 
coverage.

â¢ SCRATCH, from page 4 
(M r. Briefcase pulled the cord 

and got off at the next stop.) 
I started to think that maybe 

jesus Christ Extraodinaire wasn't 
just a kook. He was kooky, sure, 
bu t part of him seemed del iberate 
and aware. I wondered if he was a 
graduate student in literature, fish-
ing around for a story. 

We talked about the ups and 
downs of begging for money. I told 
him about a bum I ran into a few 
weeks before, who had showed me 
a handful of silver coins and asked 
for only a nickel. 

"He just wanted a soda," I 
explained to Jesus. "He was 95 per-
cent of the way there, he just need-
ed that little bit to get him over the 
top. Now. we both knew that what 

he rea lly wanted was. $10 for a bot-
tle of Jack, but he knew he couldn't 
just ask for that. He was a bum with 
a plan - and maybe that's the only 
kind of charity we'll tolerate." 

jesus pondered. He asked why a 
person couldn't si mply buy 95 cents 
worth of soda . It was because no 
one would buy an already-opened 
bottle, I suggested. It wouldn't taste 
quite as good. People might be 
uneasy about it. 

"So what?" jesus asked. "Isn't 
charity more important than a little 
uneasiness?" 

I didn't have a good answer to 
that. Granted, I have no problem 
with eating hot dogs that fall on 
the ground, so I'm biased. But he 
had a point. 

"Well , think about that;' jesus 

said, pulling the cord for the next 
stop. 

We shook hands again, and 
then he disappeared into the grimy 
intersection of Mission Boulevard 
and Garnet. 

When I got back to my apart-
ment, I realized I was wearing a 
San Francisco Giants sweatshirt, 
which explained a lot. And when 
I watched "Taxi Driver" later that 
night, it explained a lot more. 
I'm still not sure if jesus Christ 
Extraordinaire was genuinely 
insane or merely eccentric. (To be 
on the safe side, presidential can -
didates should probably stay away 
from Pacific Beach.) But whatever 
he was, I think he had something 
important to say.

Vendor Problems Hold 
Up New'Furniture Arrival 
â¢ TIOGA, from page' 

"The furnishings were ordered 
from multiple vendors and ordered 
over a period of several months from 
May through September usiflg our 
standard bid and ordering process-
es," Cunningham stated in an e-mail. 
"One vendor did not meet the agreed -
upon delivery schedule and we are 
addressing that issue with the com-
pany directly." 

According to Gullo, one of the 
most inconvenient features of the 
remodeling is the fact that the new 
desks have no drawers, because they 
were installed with the idea that even-
tually UCSD would become a paper-
less community. 

Some freshmen have also com-
plained about missing bookshelves in 
their rooms, a problem that may have 
been ca\lsed by misplacing book-
shelves that were moved out during 
the renovation process, according to 
Cunningham. 

"The existing bookshelves were 
all placed in storage during the ren -
ovation process, and those were put 
back," Cunningham staled. "It is 
possible that a bookshelf was missed 
in that process. The housing staff 
will be surveying every room to 
assess what is missing over the fall 
quarter to catch anything that hasn'tÂ· 
been reported to us by the indi -
vidual resident." 

Not all the renovations are fin -
ished, either. One of Tioga's eleva -
tors is under construction, which is 
estimated to be fmished by the end of

the quarter. According to Gullo. the 
frequent usage of the elevator causes 
it to break down often. 

However, not all the reactions to 
the Tioga renovation are negative. 

"The renovations are nice," Muir 
freshman and Tioga resident juliana 
Kincanno said. "Regarding the bath-
rooms, I think they could have done 
a better job with the showers, but 
overall it makes it more pleasant to 
live here:' 

Freshmen seem to be handling 
the crowded triple housing well, 
Gullo said, since the increased num-
ber of residents spurs more social-
ization. 

Next year's freshmen class is 
expected to be smaller, which should 
give H&DS some time to catch up, 
according to Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affairs Joseph W. Watson. 
He also stated in an e-mail that 
campuswide efforts are being made 
to add additional housing. 

"The North Campus Housing 
Project is planned for 2009 and 
would provide 1,000 beds for trans-
fer students," he stated. "Revelle 
and Muir College in-fill projects 
and North Campus Housing (Phase 
II) are being proposed to open in 
2011." 

Muir plans to renovate Tenaya 
Hall during the summer of 2007, 
and it will be handled better than 
Tioga, Cunningham stated.

The Art of Complaining 
Self-expression is ranked highly in the list of qualities that make art .. . art. In this October's exhi-bition "Complaint Box," the artists of Voice 1156 give tribute to a more common, less exalted 
form of self-expression: complaint. 

Images spread across the room like wildfire; a coUage exhibition of posters, paintings, sculptures, 
assemblage and photographs, heated with grievances. 

Grudges against humanity. PolitiC$. Evening news. Fat cells. Che Guevara. 
Street an and graphic design shake hands in this show: frontal profiles reference the black and white 

of Shepard Fairey's "Obey Giant; backgrounds are covered with the rugged, blended technique of spray 
paint and biographies trace back to graffiti collectives such as "Do the Math" (www.dothemath.tv). 

Gallery owner Monica Hoover's print of bejeweled fingers clutching dollars - titled "Resist and 
PersistÂ· - rhymes a message that is not so much a complaint as a statement of hip -hop currency. 

Spencer Little's drawings-by-wire describe apes and apish behavior (sometimes of human capac-
ity) in pieces with titles like "Mobile: Cellphone," "Human Head," "Chimp Head," "The Rise and 
FaU of Man," Â·Ego Monster" and "We're At War.Â· in "You Dropped Your Cool; a wiry boy points 
accusatively to his left. where the absence of cool is spotlighted by empty space. Little's works are 
carvings of care bulging with playful humor and hung from the ceiling or off the walls, like street 
scrawl without the permanence. 

An exhibit dedicated to complaining can't avoid politics for long. and "Complaint BoxÂ· features 
enough media bashing and Bush-bullying to keep any progressive hash-baby happy. A globally 
recognizable image of Guevera slanted with the text" cliche" may not rally the red Communists, but 
makes good commentary on visual overstatement. 

From streetisrn to surrealism. brilliant to bizarre, "Complaint Box" features work from over two 
dozen local artists - a wide palette for the choosing. Visit www.voicell56.comformore injlmflation.

Archie Bronson Outfit 
â¢ Derdanl Derdanl 
DOMINO 

***, 

If White Stripes married Modest Mouse and had a baby with sur-rogate mother Mars Volta, then the 
baby would be named Archie Bronson 
Outfit and heo be lisping "derdang der-
dang" in the cool shade of his carousel 
as he's wheeled repeatedly around the 
blues-rock neighborhood. 

Did .that personification make 
sense? It doesn't have to - if you've 
liked any of the aforementioned music, 
you're going to like ABO. Crossing 
delirious rifts with drum beats that 
drive your feet to rapture, this UK 
band plays blues-rock with torturously 
sweet seduction. 

Robin Thicke 
â¢ The Evolution of Robin Thicke 
STAR TRAK 

*, 

If you're a white man with a mani-cured jawburn and gel-spiked white-man hair - much like 
Pharre\l's latest soundchild, green-
eyed soulman Robin Thicke - you 
might want to think twice before 
attempting soultry R&D melisma. 

Sorry, but the whiteness is just 
too blinding to avoid. His voite. 
while adequately smooth and breathy, 
doesn't hide the thinned labor of vocal 
chords born without the black gene. 

At least on debut a1bwn A Beautiful 
World, Thicke had some sort of Euro-
crazy Jarniroqui thing going on . But 
PharreU takes his elevator treble beats 
to an even sparser level than usual on 
Evolution - add some melody-free, 

Singer Sam Windett croons, grous-
es and groans his songs to shrugging 
percussion and hysterical guitar jams, 
with occasional smatterings of lullaby-
soft acoustics to ease the dance-weary. 
Get down with their sophomore album 
Derang Derang and get swept up by 
their live show this Saturday, where 
they pull the best of their tenor-treated 
lyrics and tempered Southern gothic 
songs to get you jiving.

Light-brown-sugar "Idlewild"

stay-at-home "Growing Pains" dad 
Alan Thicke is his father and his album

Triton Tide Bids Farewell 
to Seven Storied Seniors 

Bruins Maul UCSD in Consolation Game

he felt after losing the match and 
watching the team's playoff dreams go 
down the drain. 

"The loss stinks, I never want to 
stop playing and I did not want to 
lose on senior night," Tannenhaus 
said. "We had a lot of talent on our 
team and we were never able to play 
up to our potential." 

Salazar, who has two years of 
elillibility left, was frustrated after 
the loss, but is optimistic about the 
future. 

"Our goal was to make it to the 
NCAA playoffs this year, and it will 
be the same thing next year;' Salazar 
said. "We had a lot of young guys 
play weU and gain a lot of experience 
and we will come back stronger next 
year:' 

Despite the bad feelings follow-
ing the loss, the Tritons got some 
eXciting news on Oct. 17. Vasquez 
was named the Brine/CCAA men's 
soccer player of the week for the 
week of Oct. 9-15. The freshman 

recorded 19 saves in only his third 
and fourth collegiate starts, and 
recorded a shutout in the Tritons' 
double overtime victory against 
Cal State Los Angeles on Oct. 13. 
Vasquez also kept . UCSD in the 
match against Cal State Bakersfield, 
making eight important saves. 

The seniors honored at Triton 
Soccer Stadium before the match were 
defenseman Devon Cook, midfielder 
Chase Douglas, defense man Matt 
Horne, midfielder Patrick Kelly, mid-
fielder Mark Moreira, Tannenhaus 
and Ryan Velasquez. 

"It was cool to have a lot of fans 
there for senior day," Tannenhaus 
said. "The seniors on this team have 
become some of my best friends dur-
ing my years here." 

The Tritons will look to shake 
off the disappointing loss with two 
wins as they finish their season with 
a weekend road trip. The team will 
travel north to play San Francisco 
State and CaJ State Monterey Bay on 
Oct. 20 and Oct. 22, respectively.

tinued their run. After trailing 2- ) 
at the end of the first quarter, UCSD 
went on to outscore the Falcons in 
each remaining quarter to win by 
three, 10-7. 

On the next day of competition, 
the Tritons battled undefeated USc. 

The Trojans got on the board 
first, but senior two-meter offense Ty 
Lackey answered right away to tie it 
at 1-1. UCSD was unable to capital-
ize on a power play, but after a usc

The Trojans then had a nice break-
away attempt, but Randall made a 
great defensive play, only to be called 
for an ordinary foul . He yeUed in dis-
gust and was given a penalty, making 
scoring easy for USC. 

UCSD could not deliver with a 
man advantage, allowing the Trojans 
to score another goal to go up by two, 
2-4. Kotanjian scored with only five 
seconds remaining in the quarter to 
trail by one, 3-4.

offense struggled to get a good look 
at the goal, but Lackey finally scored 
five minutes into the quarter to bring 
the score to 5-6. After the two teams 
traded goals, USC converted a pen-
alty shot to keep its lead at two at the 
end of the third, resulting in a score 
of6-8. 

The Trojans scored first in the 
final quarter, but the resilient Tritons 
added three goals of their own to tie 
the game, 9-9, including a penalty 
shot by Lackey. 

"San Diego is a very mentally 
tough team," Trojan head coach Jovan 
Vavic said. "They keep trying and 
don't give up. [The Tritons J did a good 
job creating counterattack opportuni-
ties . . . that actually hurt us:' 

After USC went up by one on 
a beautifully executed offensive set 
with 2 minutes, 8 seconds remaining, 
UC D was unable to respond with 
a man advantage, losing a close one, 
9-10. 

"It was bad luck:' junior driver 
Nestor Dordoni said. "I had a turn-
over at the end that just put us behind. 
We should have had it:' 

The Tritons then faced the Bruins 
for third place, but it was nothing like 
the dramatic win they had a couple 
of weeks ago. UCLA scored the first 
five goals before UCSD was able to 
get on the board late in the second 
quarter. Looking tired and unfocused, 
the Tritons could not battle back, and 
went on to lose, 3- 12. 

"Water polo is tough when you 
play two games in a day, and it was 
hard for us to come back [after the 
USC loss J:' Harper said. "But thai 
aside, UCLA played great~ 

"To be fair, 1 was guilty of some 
hearsay last time, with the comments 
I made about [Bruins' head coach 
Adam Krikorianl:' Harper said. "I 
shouldn't have said that; it wasn't 
true. [Krikorian J wasn't pissed off at 
the referees that game and I apolo-
gized to him:' 

While there was a misunder tand-
ing between the two coaches, UCLA's 
blowout win was loud and clear. 

It gets no easier for UCSD as the 
team goes back on the road to face its 
conference rival, Loyola Marymounl 
University, on Oct. 19.

Tritons Clinch Top Playoff Spot With Rout 
By Nicky Buchanan 

A SSOCIATE STAFF WRI TER 

The UCSD women's soccer team has 
kept with tradition, clinching its seventh 
straight California CoUegiate Athletic 
Association South Division title after 
defeating Cal State Bakersfield on Oct. 
15 on a 5-0 shutout. 

ot only did the Tritons secure their 
spot in the 2006 CCAA Championships, 
but this time they are bringing the sea-
son fmale home to the Triton Soccer 
Stadium as host of the tournament on 
Oct. 27 and Oct. 29, where they hope to 
snag the CCAA titl\! amid the hype of a 
home crowd. 

Though this appears to be a safe place 
to sit, with only two league games remain-
ing on the season and an overall record of 
14-1-2, the Triton players don't intend to 
end their ambitions here, they plan to 
propel themselves to the national level. 

"Wirming the South just adds .to the 
craving to win more and more, like an 
NCAA championship:' senior forward 
Alise MaUey said. "We're a team that 
learns from our mistakes and continuaUy 
grows as a team each game. We are proud 
to have gotten this far, but we can't be 
satisfied or content quite yet:' 

Last season, UCSD took the CCAA 
championship title, but stopped short in 
the final game at nationals on a 0-2 loss 
to eattle Pacific University, giving the 
team more reason to go all the way. 

[his thirst for success was reflected 
in the Cal State Bakersfield match, where 
the Tritons avenged their 2-2 tie with the 
Roadrunners on Sept. 22 with a convinc-
ing 5-0 win for their ninth shutout vic-
tory of the season. 

"Beating up on Bakersfield was amaz-
ing because it proved that the last game 
was a fluke and that Bakersfield isn't 
anywhere near our league of play:' junior 
midfielder Ali Lai said. 

The Tritons came down hard on the 
Roadrunners from beginning to end, 
taking 23 shots on goal and limiting their 
opponents to only five. 

Senior midfielder Megan Dickey 
made sure to leave it all on the field in 
her last league home game with a header 
into the side of the net, thanks to a line 
drive into the box from junior forward 
Kathy Sepulveda. 

Six minutes later, senior midfielder 
Kelly Cochran took her time to shine, 
putting UCSD up 2-0 with her eighth 
goal this season, beating the Roadruriner 
keeper from eight yards out on a pass by 
feUow freshman midfielder Laura Davey. 

The Tritons nailed in three more after 
the half, the first two within five minutes 
apart by Malley and junior midfielder 
Chelsea Campbell, and still managed to 
keep Cal State Bakersfield scoreless. 

"Our defense has been playing excep-
tionaUy weU:' MaUey said. "Not only do 
we have a solid starting lineup, but our 
bench is very reliable, so [our coach] 
doesn't even hesitate to put in another 
defender mid-gam~. You don't find that 
often in teams." 

When the line does fall through, the 
team also has reasonably good stock 
with McGovern, who holds 42 saves on 
the season, and is backed by sophomore 
~eeper Mia Shirley, who has not allowed 
a goal in the four games she has played. 

T he game came to a close in the final 
minute of play. Lai was covering the back 
post on a corner kick ball, which was 
knocked around the box for a moment 
before being deflected wide to LaL Lai 
then crossed it to junior mid fielder 
Lauren Segars, who drilled it into the net 
from five yards out for the fifth and fmal 
point on the game. 

This week the Tritons hit the road 
for their fmal two games of the regular . 
season. Though the matches against San 
Francisco State and Cal State Monterey 
Bay on Oct. 20 and Oct. 22, respectively, 
will have no bearing on the Tritons' seed 
in conference playoffs, it is imperative 
that they build up points to secure their 
spot in NCAA playoffs.

Men's Soccer Falls Short of Postseason 
By Brent Westcott 

STAFF WRI TER 

The UCSD men's soccer team 
started the season with hopes of 
playing in the NCAA champion-
ship tournament, but Cal State 
Bakersfield dashed those dreams on 
Oct. 15 at Triton occer tadium. 
In a match that featured plenty of 
offensive chances for both teams, 
the Roadrunners got the best of the 

Tritons, handing them a 2- 1 loss in 
the fmal home match of the season. 

The loss dropped the Tritons' 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association record to 5-7-2 and 
their overall record to 7-8-2. The 
crushing loss ended UCSD's streak 
of three consecutive postseason 
appearances, including last year's 
playoff run that was cut short by 
onoma State in the semifinals. 

With the win, Cal State Bakersfield

stands in second place in the CCAA 
South Division with 23 points, only 
one ahead of third place Cal State 
Dominguez Hills. 

On a day when the fans hon-
ored the seven seniors on this year's 
team, senior defenseman Dustin 
Tannenhaus opened the scoring 
only 10 minutes into the first half. 
Tannenhaus took a corner kick from 
junior mid fielder Tom Winkler and 
blasted it into the back of the net to 
give UCSD the early 1ead. 

"It was exciting to get an early 
goal to fire up the crowd on senior 
day:' Tannenhaus said. 

However, the good vibrations 
would not last, as the Roadrunners 
struck back only three minutes later 
with a goal by Ryan Gay. Both teams 
traded shots for the rest of the match, 
but in the 63rd minute, Cal State 
Bakersfield's Javier Barba beat fresh -
man goalkeeper Joshua Vasquez for 
the game-winning score. 

UCSD mustered 12 shotsÂ· on the 
night, but only two of those shots 
were on goal . 

"A lot of times we had guys take 
shots when they could have eas-
ily passed it off for an easy score," 
sophomore goalkeeper Luis Salazar 
said. "We defmitely were not cre-
ative enough up front ." 

Tannenhaus, a co-captain for the 
team, described the disappointment

Men's Water Polo Drops 
Thriller to No.1 Trojans 

By Paul Choi 
SENIOR STAFF WRITER 

The UCSD men's water polo 
team finished fourth in the Southern 
California Tournament on Oct. 14-15, 
but it could have easily been on top. 

As expected, University of South em 
California, UC Berkeley, UCLA and 
UCSD, considered the nation's four 
best teams, reached the semifmals. 
After two tough first-round games, the 
No. 3 Tritons faced the No. I Trojans 
in the highly anticipated semifmal 
matchup, which USC took by a narrow 
9- 10 margin. 

"Our game with USC just proves 
what we're capable of.' UCSD head 
coach Denny Harper said. "Not every-
body can say that you're capable of 
being able to hang with a team that has 
that much talent and that many weap-
ons - I thought we played great." 

In the first game of the tournament, 
the Tritons faced the University of the 
Pacific. The Tritons' offense struggled 
in the first half, but the Ttgers faiIed to 
capitalize on UCSD's inept play. With 
seVeral strong saves by senior goal-
keeper Jeremy Randall, the game was 
tied 5-5 at halftime. 

"We had a lot of opportunities, but 
we couldn't finish it off.' said junior 
utility AJ. Kotanjlan, who led the team 
with three goals. "We were hitting posts 

and people's arms:' 
Pacific started the third quarter 

with a 3-0 run and seemed to be on its 
way to an upset. The Tritons drew an 
exclusion, and after a timeout, Harper 
sent in substitutes to revive the defense. 
The subs slowed the Tigers' attacks and 
five unanswered UCSD goals pushed 
the score to 10-8. 

Harper credited the help off the 
bench for the offensive surge. . 

"It was clear to me that our starter 
were in a funk, so I brought in that 
whole group and they kicked butt," 
Harper said. "They won the game for 
us - plain and simple." 

Pacific finally scored with three 
seconds remaining in the third quar-
ter to bring the game within one 
heading into the fourth quarter. 

In the fourth quarter, the Tritons 
were able to score two goals early 
to go up by three, 12-9. The Tigers 
roarm. back with two goals of their 
own,"'f)ut UCSD held on to the one-
point lead for a win, 12-11. 

"We weren't running the same 
defense that we were when the start-
en were in there; Pacific head coach 
Mike Maroney said. "Hats off to the 
San Diego guys that came off the 
bench and did a great job:' 

The TrItons faced the Air Force
