Editorial 

The Last Straw 
The Constitutional crisis that arose in the 

United States this weekend upon the firing of 
Special Watergate Prosecutor Archibald Cox, 
along with the concomitant resignations and 
firings in the Justice Department is the last 
straw that the American People should take 
from its President. 

Richard Nixon has usurped his powers since 
he was elected President in 1968. Let us 
briefly delineate some of those usurpations of 
power that have been taken by the President. 

During the periods of the greatest anti-war 
protests in 1969 and 1970, Nixon had many 
anti-war activists under almost constant 
surveillance by the FBI. In the wake of 
numerous disclosures in 1971 and 72, it also 
became apparent that this surveillance was 
much more widespread than had been 
previously assumed. In fact, the most recent 
disclosures made by the Senate Select 
Committee on Watergate, show that much of 
this surveillance was used to harr.~lSs private 
citizens in the realm of tax payments. The 
case of Daniel Ellsberg also illustrates the 
President's policy of surveillance upon its 
private citizens. This then may be called 
Nixon's first usurpation of Power: Le. a direct 
and blatant violation of the civil liberties of 
the American People. 

Nixon's violation of the Bill of Rights leads 
directly into some of his more recent exer-
cises of dictatorial power, a power that no 
court of law or body of representatives has 
never affirmed in this nation. Namely, the use 
by Nixon of his position to spy harrass and 
steal the files of his opponents in the 
Democratic Party, and all that has arisen . 
from the events of June'~7' 72. Not only has 
Nixon used his power to e ale~ally harrass 
the opposition, but rece t admIssions by the 
owners of large American Corporations 
conclusively prove that Nixon's campaign 
le aders coerced such corporations into 
donating illegal contributions to Nixon's 
reelection campaign. Thus blatantly violating 
the Campaign Expenditures Act of 1972. 
Hence, usurpation 'Dum ber two. 

Finally, Nixon has proceeded to fire Ar-
chibald Cox, coerC'Ang Attorney General 
Richardson to resi5fD and firing Deputy At-
torney General Ruckelshaus, all because the 
three of them had decided to a bide by the 
word of the la w instead of by the word of one 
man. Hence usurpation number three: 
Violation by the President of the United States 
of the Constitution of the United States. 

Indeed, we could cite other instances that 
prove Nixon's unwillingness to abide by the 
law, but we shall stop here. We shall suffice it 
to say that Mr. Nixon has gone far enough in 
establishing an extralegal dictatorship in the 
United States. Now is the time to stop nim 
from further encroaching upon the laws and 
rights of all citizens in our country. It may be 
our last chance. 

The Triton Times urges the immediate 
impeachment of Richard Nixon by the 
Congress of the United States of America . Let 
Us 'prove, hopefully for all time, that the 
United States is governed under the rules of 
laws and not the rules of egomaniacal men. 
Urge your elected officials to vote for im-
peachment immediately.

Black's Beach 
Drive Continues 

By Rich Pool 
Nudity at Blacks Beach is 

still illegal despite the in-
creasing efforts of La Jolla 
citizens to repeal the State 
Parks and Recreation 
Department law prohibiting 
it. 

On October 12, the Com-
mittee to Save Blacks Beach 
(CSBB) presented the 
Department conunissioners 
petitions signed by 12,500 
people urging legalization of 
nudity on the beach. Mrs. 
Sheri Thomas, a coordinator 
for CSBB, described the 
hearing as the "typical 
bureaucratic shuffle." 

Dr. George Brolaski, also 
a coordinator, presented a 
more detailed account of the 
hearing. According to Dr. 
Brolaski, the CSBB 
representatives expected to 
see the parks department 
commissioners at 11:00 A.Moo 

The commissioners, 
however, made them wait, 
and one by one went home. 
When the Blacks Beach case 
finally came up, the com-
missioners allowed an op-
posing group to present 
arguments to the CSBB first. 

Throughout the hearing, 
the commissioners (by then 
not enough for a quorum 
remained)emphasized that, 
as Dr. Brolaski said, the 
petitioners "should be 
grateful" to even have a 
chance to speak, as other 
matters took much higher 

' priority. After hearing the 
committee, the com-
missioners aid they would 
study the petition. When 
asked what the public should 
be told, Dr. Brolaski said th 
reply was, "T II them to 
obey the law." 

Opposition to the SBB in 
La Jolla has come from two 
sources. Certain small 
organizations dislike the 

thought of nudity anywhere. 
Another complaint comes 
from the owners of houses in 
the La Jolla Farms sub-
division above Blacks 
Beach. . 

Dr. Brolaski explained 
that several years ago few 
people would trouble to go to 
Blacks and the residents 
living nearby had almost 
exclusive use of it. Now, 
dueto the increased 
popularity of Blacks, the 
homeowflers find cats 
parked in front of their 
homes, trash in their yards, 
and people trespassing on 
their property. They claim 
to support the anti-nudity 
law as protection against the 
abuse of their property. Dr. 
Brolaski thinks they are 
really just reacting to the 
loss of privacy and 
priveleges. He said that they 
have a key to the gate 
blockingÂ· the road down to the 
beach and that they think of 
Blacks as theirs. 

The attitude of the La Jolla 
Farms residents and the 
committee's treatment on 
October 12 have convinced 
CSBB members that more 
support and power are 
needed to achieve any 
success. The group 
therefore plans to join with 
similarly oriented groups in 
San Francisco, Santa Cruz, 
Santa Barbara and Los 
Angele . 

Instead of trying to change 
local re trictions on nud 
bathing, Dr. Brola ki hop 
these groups can influ nc 
the Parks System to make 
state-wid change.

The 
Illlpeachlllent 

Movelllent 
by Chris Rauber 

An administration racked by months of torturously 
drawn out Watergate revelations, and the startlingly 
rapid political demise of Spiro Agnew faces its toughest 
test this week, as an angry Congress seriously considers 
the possibility of impeaching the President of the United 
States. 

For the first time since Watergate exploded its way onto 
the American political scene it seems ievitable that 
resolutions calling for the impeachment of President 
Richard M. Nixon will be made before the House of 
Representatives. For the first time there seems to be 
strong support for such resolutions among both 
Democrats and Republicans in the Congress, as well as 
growing support in the country at large for impeachment. 

Furthermore, the confirmation of Gerald Ford as Vice 
President seems to be in danger, and many congressmen 
have observed that a Nixon appointee to fill the office of 
Attorney General would face stiff opposition. 

The developing constitutional confrontation was 
precipitated by President Nixon's refusal to obey a court 
order from the U.S. Court of Appeals Friday and his at-
tempt to pressure Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox and 
the Justice Department into accepting a compromise 
solution to the Watergate tapes issue. 

Nixon had previously indicated that he would take the 
case to the Supreme Court, and that he would obey a 
" definative" decision by that court. 

Instead of turning the Watergate tapes over to the 
Senate Watergate Committee, Special Prosecutor Cox, 
and U.S. District Judge John Sirica, Nixon proposed that 
he supply a summary of the tapes to Senator John Stennis 
of Mississippi for review. The tape summary would then 
be turned over to those investigating the Watergate 
scandal. 

Cox refused to accept the compromise and continued his 
investigation, despite instructions to the contrary from 
the President. He charged that the President was 
"refusing to comply with the court decree," and ordered 
him to turn the tapes over to Judge Sirica, in complian ~ 
with the federal court order. 

Nixon explained his instructions by saying that, 
although he did not want to "intrude upon the in 
dependence of the special prosecutor" he " felt it 
necessary to direct him, as an employee of the executive 
branch, to make no further attempts by judicial process to 
obtain tapes, notes, or other memoranda of presidentaial 
conversations. " 

After Cox rejected the Nixon compromise, the 
President directed Attorney General Eliot Richardson to 
fire the special prosecutor. Richardson refused, claiming 
that such an action conflicted with presidential pledges 
that Cox's investigation would be independent of the White 
House, and then submitted his resignation to the 
President. 

Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus was 
fired by Nixon after he, too, refused to fire Cox. 

Finally, Solicitor General Robert Bork, third in line at 
the Department of Justice, discharged Cox, and was 
subsequantly named as acting Attorney General. 

Reactions to Mr. Nixon's totally unexpected and un-
precedented actions have been generally vehement and 
highly critical. The acknowledged leader of impeachment 
sentiment in the House, California Congressman Jerome 
Waldie, has announced his intention of submitting an 
impeachment resolution before the House of Represen-
tatives on Tuesday, October 23. Waldie is a member of the 
House Judiciary Conunittee, the committee responsible 
for evaluating impeachment resolutions. 

Other Congressmen who have announced plans to offer 
motions for impeachment includ John Anderson, Rep. 
Illinois, Bella Abzug, Dem, New York, Hou e Majority 
Whip John McCall, Dem. California and Republican Pete 
McCloskey of California. Many other congre m n have 
proclaimed their willingn s to VOl for impeachm nt. 

If th House found that ther were grounds for a charge 
of iropeachm nt, the Senate woul then nrp, i -
trial of the Presid nt. 

Som congressm n ~re advocatin a mor :nodera' 
tand, which would giv th Pr id nt anoth r chance to

Pcirking Problems 
t Revelle, Muir 
"We'r~ getting by, " was 

Parking service Manager, 
Wayne Rounds' comment 
when asked a bout the 
campus parking situation. 
He added, "Even on the 
busiest days, people aren't 
parking in all the paved 
spaces available." Hc 
continued, however, that 
people are using a lot of off-
road, unofficial parking 
spaces, and when these 
areas are no longer available 
there will be a definate 
parking problem. 

In anticipation of this, 
Rounds states that two new 
parking lots will be built, 
hopefully during Christmas 
vaca tion . In any ca se, 
unofficial parkin g will 
continue to be available 
until the new lots are ready. 

Parkin g office s ur veys 
were taken last week at Muir 
and Revelle campuses, 
where according to Rounds, 
" the basic problem" lies. 
Surveys were taken on 
Wednesday, the lots' most 
populous day, at the peak 
times of 10 :30 to 11 :45 a .m. 

The Muir survey revealed 
that while there are 1164 
paved parking speaces, 1099 
were occupied, with 110 
vehicles parked in unofficial 
spaces, off side roads and in 
the woods. This unofficial 
pa rk ing will be cut off in the 
Spring when work begins on 
pe rman e nt buildings for 
Third College. At that point, 
Muir will be short several 
dozen spaces. In order to 
alleviate the problem before 
it begins the North Parking 
lot will be doubled in size, 
adding 120 spaces. 

Reve lie has 1311 official 
spaces and 1187 were filled at 
the time the survey was 
taken. 158 vehicles were 

parked in soon to be shut off 
unofficial paces. A new lot. 
accomadating from 100 to 
120 autos will be open hcre 
after Christmas. Until then 
off road parking in unpaved 
a rcas will be allowed . 

" There has never been a 
da y when parking space W (l 
not available on Matthews 
campus," s tates Rounds . He 
feels that although there was 
a shortage of parking spaces 
. during the g ra ce yeriod 
when parking permits were 
not rcquired for stud ent.~, 
now that citations ~re bcing 
given to vehicles' without 
permits, there are 15-20 PCI' 
cent fewcr ca rs on campus. 
Now, hc continues, wllcn a 
student says there arc no 
paces available . what he 

really llleans is that the 
particular space hc wan ts is 
not available. Students a rc 
being forced to park in less 
convenient places. but thcre 
is always a space availablc if 
they are willing to look for it. 

To facilitat the s a r ch for 
parking spaces, Round says 
that lots 12A and 13A, while 
not terribley central to Muir 
or Revelle, always have 
s paces a vailable . 12A is 
lo cated above the Third 
College resident halls and 
13A i near the Basic Science 
Building. Rounds suggests 
tha t students will have fewer 
parking hassles if they arc 
willing to wa Ik between 
campuses. '' It takes as long 
01' longer to drive as to walk 
between campuses ," he 
adds. 

The parking office en-
courages students to ride 
bicycles as much as possible 
around campus. The first 
s tage of a campus-wide bike

High Disaster Potential at 
San Onofre Alleged 

The Coastal Zone Com-
ittee held a public hearing 

Oct. 18, 1973 at the Bahia 
Hotel to gather information 
in preparation for making a 
decision on whether to grant 
public utilities a permit to 
enlarge the nuclear power 
plant at San Onofre. 

The highlight of the 
meeting was a presentation 
by Dr. Henry Kendall, a 
professor of phys ics at 
MIT and member of the 
Union of Concerned Scien-
tists. Dr. Kendall gave a 
rather exhaustive account of 
potential dangers involved 
with the fission reactor . He 
pointed <'ut that the potential

fallout pollutants in one 
reactor would be the

thousand Hiroshimas. 

Dr. Kendal went on to 
explain that the two sources 
of heat in a reactor are the 
chain reaction products and 
fission fragments resulting 
from the nuclear burning of 
the radioactive material. 
The former reaction can be 
stopped by safety devices if 
the plant water cooling 
system fails, but. the latter 
radioactive process can not 
be turned off and IlIUSt 
therefore run its course . This 
uncontrolable process. if not 
cooled, can generate hcat at

For a reactor of the s ize in

in the event of an ear-

resulting in a doubly bad 
disaster. 

The professor also cited 
evidence of an existing 
controversery within the 
A.E .C., citing repression of 
unfavorable studies, (even 
including censorship of in-
formation to A.E.C 's own 

licensing board), issuance of 
written instructions to 
A.E.C. witnesses not to 
disagree with existing 
policy, and A.E.C. aban-
donment of their own safety 
standards in many in-
stances. 

Regarding un!! c c~ptaole

Kendall said that wastes

AJt~r Midniqht 
By Joni Garwood 

Last Spring I decided that I would make an excellent 
surgeon. I envisioned myself delving into the secret world 
of livers and ligaments, bones and bunions, mercilessly 
carving away at any tumor or tremor that detracted from 
the function of body. 

Oh mad dreamer! There I was, among a team of 
dedicated individuals dressed in green, my sweaty brow 
among many sweatybrows,each of us deep in thought and 
awed by the vital, dynamic system revealed befo~e our 
eyes. That world seemed the logical and after the trials ~f 
physics, chemistry, and biology. The sacrosanct, al~elt 
humid world of oscilliscopes, PH meters, and bubbhng 
carbon compounds could not possibly compare with one 
single lymph node. And literature? Bah! No set of words 
could equal the delight found in working with ones hands 
and aiding all humankind. Besides, literature was 
beginning to bore me . 

Ambitiously, boldly, I ~alked .to Bu~ler H~II , .a squat, 
ugly building situated behind the tmPOSlng, b~lcklSh Mary 
Hitchocock Hospital and Dartmouth Medical School. 
There I introduced myself to Dr. Arther Nal~ove , 
Associate Professor of Surgery and in charge of Anunal 
Surgical Research during the summer. I had absolutely 
no experience. 

From the beginning Dr. Naitove was his usual kind, 
warm self. I was granted permission to work on a 
voluntary basis with three medical students p~ovided t~at 
I did not "faint, vomit , or scream" during crUCIal 
moments. I was also told to look pretty . Although Dr . 
Naitove is a competent surgeon, he is also an outrageous 
male chauvenist who takes delight in reestablishing thi s 
fact at every available opportunity . " Oon ' t forget to 
shower," he gleefully barked. " And on hot days be sure to 
wear shorts ." 

The first day I arrived promptly at 8:00. Dr. Naitove 
seemed surprised to find me there, then immediately 
ignored me. Today he was to perform a hyste~ectomy o~ a 
labrador retriever . The dog was Injected WIth 
phenylbarbitol and slapped on the stainless s teel table. An 
assistant shaved the belly and one of the med students 
gently pushed the air tube down the dogs t~roat : With the 
drame of witnessing spleens and bladders In theIr natural 
environment about to commence, I sucked in my cheeks. 
Nothing could make me squeemish . 

Cut, tear, open, tie back, and sponge. There they were, 
each organ perfectly formed , distinct, soverign, yet 
undeniably only a part of the whole . I felt my own 
stomach and thought how sad that I should know only my 
skin and never what lay just beyond. The blood was not in 
the least bit intimidating when going about its business, 
dorng its natural function. It is when blood is in a foreign 
land, outside the flesh , when it is frightening .. 

How was it that such beauty existed without everyones 
knowldege? It seemed that all the odysseys after truth, 
after glory, after perfection ended here, in the gut, not 
three inches beneath the navel. How ridiculous for men to 
continually search outward when the functions of that 
which works within is unknown, unfelt. 

" Here Andy, you ta ke over. " 
Dr. Naitove stood back and let a third year med student 

finish the operation . 
" Whoops ! Oh my God, give me the sponge!" 
They all laughed . 
" You ' ll probably hear alot of that this sW11mer." 
"Come ahn, come ahn, Lets get movin' . I gotta golf date 

after lunch. 
Sweet Dr . Naitove. 
He peered at me closely. 
" Think you wanna be a surgeon kid?" 
Good heavens . My sense of poetry simply could not 

sustain itself admidst the Marx Brothers brandishing 
James Cagney dialogue. I rocketed back to earth just in 
time. . 

" Yes.JJ 
" Erhumph . Mmmm." 
He peered atme again , sizing meup (wondering how I'd 

look in shorts?) . 
" What was the date of the Norman invasion of 

England? " 
" 1066?" 
" Yeah. And who were the Luddites?" 

r thought back quickly to the eighth grade. There I was 
si tting in histollY class, listening to the teacher drone' 'The 
Luddites were a bamd pf wprl,em om 19th century 
England who believed that the introduction of textile 
machinery reduced wages aod increased unem-
ployment. ;, 

" Not bad." 

(began to worry . Suppose he asked me to point out the 
kidney? I wasn't sure yet which name went with which 
01 gan. Dr. Naitove had all the ingredients of a tyrant. The 
med students looked at each other and smiled. Apparently 
they had all been forced through Naitove's facsmilile of 
" IT's Academic" themselves . 

He whirled around . "You think I'm funny, hah?" 
No, they did not think that Dr. Arther Naitove was ataU 

funny , except when he wanted to be. 
" Well I'll have you know that I am a great surgical 

room personality. I have every right to act this way." 
Without looking at me again he said "Se you at 8" and 

walked from the room . 

Rossellini Film Event 
Pioneer neorealist filmmaker Roberto 

Rossellini will be the subject of a film 
rctrospeetive and panel discussion a t UCSD 
on Thursday, October 25, and will make a 
guest appearance on campus Sunday, Oc-
tober 28 to di~('u~s his film~ and his recent 
television work. 

Rossellini film s such as Man's Struggle 
for Survival, Paisan, Voyage to Ita ly, The 
Miracle a nd hi s te levis ion histroical 
documentary, Blaise Pascal . will be 
screened on campus during the day on 
October 25 from 10 a .m. to 10 p.m. in the 
UCSD Art Gallery, 1260 Humanities Library 
Building, Revelle . Total admission charged 
for all these films will be $1 for UCSD 
students and $2 for non-students . 

That evening a panel discussion including 
UCSD professor and movie critic Manny 
farber, San Di ego Reader movie c riti c 
Ouncan Shepherd, inenw magazine edi tor 
Paul Schrader, Los Angeles Tin1es movie . 
reviewer Cha rles Chaplin. film director 
Martin Scorsese (of Mean Streets ) and 
UCSD graduate student and artist Ma rtha 
Rosier will be held on campus to discuss the 
films of Rossellini. The panel wi II be held in 
the Revelle Ca feteria at 8:30 p.m. 

The culmination of the Rossellini 
retrospective event will be the appearance 
on Sunday. the 28th of the director on 
campus. Some of his work which was 
prepared for F:uropean television will be 
screened (probably The Rise to Power of 
Louis XIV ) and Rosselini wi ll lecture on h is 
work. The screening will begin at 8:30 p .m. 
in the Revelle a feteria to be followed by the 
lecture . 

seems to be at variance with his original 
intentions, Rossellini .has been consistently 
conc rned with historical depiction from his 
fir st critical success, Rome - Open City, to 
his recent 120 part te levision documentary, 
Man's Struggle for Survival. 

Avoiding the all-inclusive cinema-verite 
preference of many docume ntarists, 
Rossellini's film truth omitted much of the 
standard documentary style. In Voyage to 
Italy , for example, Rossellini's camera does 
not linger on the streets of Naples, nor does 
it attempt to chronicle the lives of the people 
in the ci ty . Rather. Rossellini c hooses to 
show the frustration of protagoinsts Ingrid 
Bergman and George Sanders by shooting 
them in the confines of closed-in hotel 
rooms, excavations, cOITidors. Rossellini's 
Naples is not the Naples of the travelogue, 
but it is the city carefully seen first throught 
the limited awareness, and later,the in-
creasing enlig htenment, of the two main 
chalÂ·acters. 

Rossellini has recent! y lIIade significant 
advances in the technical aspect of cinema 
which allowed shooting with his remote 
control 25/250 millimeter zoom le ns free 
from the vibrations of a tracking or dolly 
shot . Another technica l cr ea tion of 
Rossellini's is the utilization of a rough-
edged mirror, which, when used in con-
junction with a large picture window, can 
renect a scale model backdrop into a set 
where life-sized equipmcnt and actors take 
up the foreground . He has used this latter 
technique extensively in the production of 
the fiction film, and has concentrated most 
of his efforts on historical documentaries for 
Italian and French television. His be li ef is

Coming as it did on the heels of the ex-
cellent And the Hit Just 'Keep On Contin' 
Mike Nesmith 's new albW11, Pretty Much 
Your Standard Ranch Stash was initially 
very difficult to rate. It had that fine 
Nesmith baritone doing certainly better 
than average material backed by a more 
than adequate band . .. but. .. 

The Hits Keep Comin ' album had unusual 
accompaniment, just acoustic and steel 
guitars. For me it represented steel 
guita rist Red Rhodes ' finest hour as he 
provided the perfect foil for Nesmith 's voice 
and acoustic guitar. Mike ' s already 
pleasant voice was tastefully enhanced by 
overdubbed harmonies in always ap-
propria te places. 

For what was essentially a duet, the 
album had unexpected depth and vitality. 
This ex traordina ry blend ' of instrument, 
voice, a nd studio production became a very 
special album. Few pop records have this 
self-life in which they take on a meaning 
beyond the simple , lyric , melodic and ryth-
mic values recorded. Other pop records 
have this same uncommon worth include 
Van Morrison's Astral Weeks the virtually 
unknown Paul Siebel classic Woodsmoke 
and Oranges and Jackson Browne's debut 
album. 
Pretty Much Your Standard Ranch Stash 
is highly reminiscent of the " First National 
Band" period of Nesmith's car eer. It means 
a return to the successful Nesmith formula 
of the past, namely the light country-rock 
sould. Instead of duet, this album presents 
Mike backed by a full band including 
electric, acoustic and pedal steel guitars , 
banjo, fiddle, piano, bass and drums. 

Quite a quality variance exists between 
'each individual song. Some, Like the opening 
tune Continuing, are very good, strong 01 
melody , harmony , and lyric , but then others 
are very ordinary. In the ballad Winonah, 
the instrumental backing is flat , the 
arrangement seemingly inappropriate , and 
this behind a basically moving story of a 
young woman whose inability to cope with 
life leads her to alcoholism and a lifetime of 
bars. 

There 's an ove ra II fee lin g of in-
completeness to the album. While perha p 
half the material is substantial enough to 
stand on its own, the remainder never gets 
beyond the lIsua I. Admittedly half good is 
better than mos t product. but after hearing 

PUBLIC NOTICE 

Nesmith 's potential through his last. .<Ilbum, 
Pret1y Much Your Standard Ranch Stas 
becomes no more than pretty much your 
standard good country-rock album. 

For a Mike Nesmith fan the expense 
would of course be worthwhile, but for 
others who want a hint, buy : And the Hits 
Just Keep On Comln' maybe later Ranch 
Stash.

Granicus' music fa lls somewhere between 
an irrunitation of " Led Zeppelin " rythmic 
redundancies and " Blue Oyster Cult' s" lyric 
American nightmares. The band is young, 
unpolished, and apparently unprepared for 
national exposure. 

The few glimpses of what could pass for 
real talent are quickly covered by their 
overall " heavy metal" bar band style . 
Young bands, by recording like this before 
they're ready , really " cheap shot" their,own 
chances for success. It's impossible to ta~e 
a record like this seriously, the hype reads 
well (written by noted reviewer Stephen 
Holden) but don 't be deceived, this one 's a 
dog. 

I do have to admit though, their lead 
guitarist can hit one note more times than 
anyone.

Story and Photos by Tom Pilgram 

It's hard to say just what Intramural football is 
about. Probably the most important answer from 
the students standpoint is participation. Anyone 
can, and does, do it. Looking through a camera, the 
most noticeable aspect is motion. At the snap of the 
ball, the field is transformed from static opposing 
teams to a series of rapidly moving individual -
contests. 

That's what I hope these pictures show, in-
dividuals in motion. I have made no attempt to get 
pictures of many teams. These shorts represent 
just two games, which I photographed to get 
friends in action . What [ hope is conveyed is the 
spirit of football, individuals in action.

Rugby: A Game for Skilled Amateur~ 

Fresno State (?) 
Drowns Polomen 
Forsaking the beach one 

fine Saturday afternoon, I 
sauntered on over to the old 
swimming pool to take in a 

p'~m~ of Triton water polo. 
When [ arri ve!! the op-
position had yet to show up, 
and I thought that maybe 
they weren't going to . 

Alas, but they did come, all 
the way from that bustling 
central valley city of Fresno . 

Havi ng driven through 
Fresno on occasion, I really 
wondered if they even had a 
pool to play polo in. 

Fresno State had not only a 
swimming pool but also a 
water polo team that was 
gooo enough to defeat the 
Tritons last Saturday. 

The game started only 45 
minutes late and the way ' it 
turned out maybe it 
shouldn 't have been played 
at al l. 

The major problem for the 
Tritons seemed to be their 
lack of offense and their 
penchant for turning the ball 
over to Fresno on fouls or 
bad plays. 

Ah, but if I had only gone to 
the beach .......... ..

Every year at this time, 
ruggers creep out of the 
cracks and back on the 
rugby field for the splendor 
and enjoyment of the UCSD 
sports fan . 

In past years, the typical 
UCSD spectator appeared 
confused with their first view 
of the ancient sport. So, in 
order to prime everyone for 
the upcoming rugby 
festivities , this short ex-
planation of rugby jargon is 
offered. 

First of all, everyone must 
understand that rugby draws 
its players from all forms of 
life; be it PhD or 8-year 
undergraduate. Therefore, 
there must be a common 
factor in all these people -
that is, the baser side. 
Knowing this, one can learn 
the conunon language and 
understand the players ' of 
this artful game. 

Hugger - a player of the 
game. Rhymeswith mugger 
which may be a better term. 

Hugger Hugger - a female 
follower who comforts her 
gladiator after the battle 
ends ; must own a broom and 
dustpan to pick up the pieces 
of her gladiator. 

Try - a successful attempt, 
yielding a score. 

Score - what the whole 
game is about. 

Scrum - seems a hard way 
to find a lost contact lens, but 
you just have to have your 
head into it. 

Ruck - looks. like an old 
fashioned pile-on; but if you 
look close, you will notice the 
togetherness and well-
planned action . 

Line-out - a short break in 
the play so the forwards can 
discuss the play. 

Forward - anyone of the Once again the Triton polo 
players proved that they can 
play well for half the game, 
as they held Fresno State 
scoreless in the first and last 
quarters . Unfortunately, 
Fresno put the ball in the 
goal II times during the 
second and third quarters. 

The game started on the 
right note for UCSD as they 
scored three quick goals to 
lead 3~ at the end of the first 
quarter . 

Water Basketball 
Off to Big Splash 

Fresno came storming 
back to score 7 times in the 
second quarter , taking 
advantage of many Triton 
turnovers to lead 7-3 at ,the 
half. 

Wet and wild describes the 
pool area Wednesday and 
Sunday evenings now that 
Water Basketball has 
started its second season. 
This year's games look to be 
as hair-raising as ever. 

Gideon Young ' s in-
tramural game seem to be 
one of the lesser-known 
s ports, drawin g only 15 
teams and almost no 
spectators. Evenly matched 

of the game is to knock your 
opponent out of his/her tube 
without the ref catching you. 

Water basketball, like all 
1M sports, is a terrific way to 
meet fun people and 
generally carouse around 
the poo), So, when you're in 
the mood for some sensuous 
and slippery entertainment, 
zip on over to thenattatorium.

like the linesmen in football.

their act at the traditional 
post-game party.

spectators instead of vice-
versa, come to the

Tuesday, October 30, at 7 
p.m. in HL 1449. 

The meeting will feature 

good cheer from the 
veterans and a film of the 
contest proclaimed as the 
rugby game of the century. 
All that can attend are 
welcome. 

Now if everyone studies 
hard, they will know as much 
as the players do, when the 
Triton Rugby Club opens its 
season in mid-November.

Reform Initiative 
At this time, a Political Reform Initiative is being 

circulated throughout California. Basically, the Initiative 
provides for : 

1. Campaign Disclosure: Requires complete auditing of 
ca mpaign finances for all candidates in California. 

2. Expenditure Limitations oE Campaigns for Statewide 
Offices and Initiatives : I.imits the total amount of money 
that ca n be spent by any ca ndidate or committee for a 
s tatewide office, in both the primary and general elec-
tions. Also, limits the total amount of money that can be 
spent on ballot initiative campaigns and limits the amount 
that can be spent to qualify an initiative . 

3. Lobbyist Regulation : Forbids lobbyists from making 
or arranging for political contributions and gifts of over 
$10.00 per month to legislators whom they are lobbying. 
Also, requires the registration of employers of lobbyists 
or anyone spending over $250.00 in a month to influence 
legislation . 

4. Conflict of Interest: Requires all state and local 
decision-making officials to file annual financial 
statements. Each state and local agency is given the 

res~nsibility for adopting a Conflict of Interest Code 
goveQ1ing its employees. Public officials may ~ot par-
ticipate in any decisions that affect any bus mess .or 
property in which the official holds a ce rtain financial 
interest. 

5. Ballot Pamphlet Reform : Provides a readable and 
understanda ble ballot pamphlet. 

6. Incumbency : 0 legislative newsletter or other mass 
mailing sha ll be sentat public expense by an elected state 
officer after the officer has filed a declaration of can-
didacy. The order of candidate names on the ballot shall 
be determined without regard to whether the candidate is 
an incumbent. 

7. Fair Political Practices Commission: A five member 
commission , with a full-time visible chairperson, ad-
ministers this Act. 

8. Enforcement: Provides tough civil and criminal 
penalties for those who violate the Act. 

In order for this initiative to be placed on the June 1974 
ba Uot, 325,000 valid s ignatures must be collected 
statewide. Many concerned people's action groups such 
as, Common Cause, and People 's Lobby, are working to 
collect these signatures . The only way to insure that 
enough signa tures are collected is for all of us to work . 

The Undergraduate Student Council (TUSC) and the 
Triton Times endorse this initiative, and encourages all 
s tudents to help in the collection of signatures. If you 
would like to help, please call Karen Steentofte at 453-
9369. Voters registered in San Diego County are especially 
needed . Reforr.1 measu res such as this are the only way to 
replace plutocracy with democracy. Make your voice 
heard by working for the Politica l Reform Initiative. Your 
help is needed .

Finally, where does the

Items such as "the guerillas 
don't screw,"? Other 
statements, such as "if you 
do not have sexual relations 
with men you will be feared 
and despised and viciously 
maligned by men ..... show a 
paranoic attitude toward 
sex.

Dr. Brolaski expressed 
amazement at the response 
to the petition. Volunteers 
collected 13,000 names in 
only two and a half weeks . 
He advises those who want to 

help to write William Mutt, 
head of the State Parks and 
Recreation Department in 
Sacremento and to send 
copies, l\f the letters to local

If you -feel you have something to

California fresh water needs . 

There are many other 
statements in this article 
that are insulting to in-
telligent men and women. It 
is a pity that Dana Densmore 
cannot see the truth, that 
celibacy is good, but sex as 
an expression of love is a 
natural and positive aspect 
of life. 

newsletter discussing the 
progress of their efforts. 

The American Civil Liberties Union is heading a 
national drive to raise money for the impeachment 
movement. 

Finally, the doctor touched 
on the process of need 
prOjection in use of electric 
energy. In the past demand 

'for electricity has doubled 
every ten years, and while it 
may be a logical projection 
that this wi\l continue, it is 
not necessarily valid. 
Further, this assumption 
may prove to be a self-
fulfilling prophesy. Indirect 
reference was made to ill 
fated projection models in 
the past ( Club of Rome's 
widely criticized Limits to 
Growth came to mind, but 
was not mentioned ). 

Here, as a result of 
overestimation, Southern 
California now has a 
dramatic excess of Northern 
California water. Professor 
Kendall remarked that ex-
ponential growth qui c kly 
becomes unhearable as a 
given.

Parking ... 
Dear Friend, 

I wish to deplore the ap-
pearance in the Triton Times 
of ads from firms claiming to 
sell research materials. I 

find these ads to be distur-
bingly similar to those which 
hawk ready-made term 
papers. I hope you agree 
with me that it is 
irresponsible to accept 
advertising for disservices 
to the university community. 

Until the issue is decided, 
the American Civil Liberties 
Union will defend anyone 
arrested for nudity at 
Blacks . Neither Mrs . 
Thomas nor Dr. Brolaski 
think the Park Rangers will 
do more than tell people to 
put on some clothes. 

Mrs. Thomas said that no 
one wants Blacks to be for 
nudists only. (Signs will 
clearly warn people that 
some bathers may not be 
clothed.) The committee has 
more than nUdity in mind. 
They want to preserve the 
beach itself. To many, Dr. 
Brolaski says, " Blacks is a 
concept; it has become a 
refuge from society with its 
Watergate and other 
problems." On the beach 
there is "a sense of 
community. " 

path network has been 
completed at Revelle and 
more bike paths will be 
added as money becomes 
available. 

Con't. from Page 2 
will continue to take frequent 
surveys and hope to deal 
with projec ted problems 
before they become realities. 

As a practical example of 
similar snafus in the past, 
reference was made to 
projection of Southern 

Dr. Kendal ended his talk 
with a plea for sharing of 
responsibility for projected 
needs, and for the need to 
inspect priori ties .
