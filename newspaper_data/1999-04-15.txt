U. Michigan Faces 
Admissions lawsuit 
ANN ARBOR, Mich. - The 
Center for Individual Rights 
filed a motion Friday to ask 
for a summary judgment in 
the class-action lawsuit chal-
lenging the University of 
Michigan's College of 
Literature, Science and Arts ' 
usc of race as a factor in its 
admissions process. The law-
sui t was filed by two white 
students who were denied 
adm issions to the universi ty 
in 1997. The center filed for 
a summ~ry judgment because 
it believes that many of the 
crucial facts of the case are 
undisputed and thus riegate 
the need for a trial. The suit 
was brought abou t because 
the University of Michigan 
gives underrepresented 
minorities 20 points toward 
their admiss ions total in a 
pOlnt-hased admissions sys-
tern .

Contest May Have 
Been Hazing 
EAST LANSING, Mich. -
An event originally called the 
tough-man contest between 
two Michigan State 
University (MSU) fraternity 
brothers is now bei ng investi-
gated as a hazing. The event, 
which took place last month, 
was a hilling contest between 
two fraternity brothers to 
determine who was the 
toughest. A 20-year-old Phi 
Beta Sigma pledge was hos-
pitali zed for at least six days 
and required kidney dialysis 
after the contest. He initi ally 
blamed his injuries on haz-
ing. The MSU chapter of Phi 
Beta Sigma has been sus-
pended for the time being. 
The hospitalized stu ent later 
recanted his complaint and 
said his injuries did not result 
from hazing.

By Marjorie Montemayor 
Staff Writer 

UCSD's Undergraduate Library (UGL) will 
have a different look once renovations on 
Galbraith Hall are completed in January, 2000. 

Planners are in the process of deciding what 
types of services, features and collections wi II be 
included in the new library. 

"This is going to be our first 21 st century 
library and therefore, it will be high tech, very 
wired, (and) a lot of computers," Phyllis Mirsky, 

interim associate vice chancellor of information 
and technology and universi ty librarian, said. 

The new library will also share facilities with 
Academic Computing Services. The library wi ll 
have two di tance- Iearning classrooms that will

Holocaust 
Survivor 
Speaks 
TALK: David Faber discussed 
his memories of being pursued 
by the Nazis as a young· man 
By Uly Korman 
Guardian Reporter 

David Faber, Holocaust survivor and author 
of Becallse of ROlllek: A Holocaust Survivor :\" 
Memoir, discussed his experiences in Europe 
during World War n to a full audience at the 
Price Center Theater on Tuesday night. 

Faber was born to a Jewish family in 
Poland, the youngest of eight siblings. 
When the Nazis invaded Poland, Faber, who 
was almost 12-years-old, and his family -
including five of his six sisters - ned to 
another part of the country for safety. The 
family moved several times in an allemptto 
escape from the Nazis. 

As they Iled, Faber and his family were 
reunited with hi s brother Romek, who was 
an escaped prisoner of war. At age 13, Faber, 
along with Romek, was arrested by the 
Nazis. Faber watched as his brother - who 
was a leader in the sabotage of the Nazi 
building of the atomic bomb - was brutal-
ly tortured and murdered. 

Soon after his brother's death, the Nazis 
came for Faber's family, who were hiding in 
an allic of a warehouse. As the soldiers mur-
dered his mother and si blings, Faber hid 
under a couch and survi ved. 

Shortly after, Faber dec ided to give him-
self up to the Nazi forces, thus beginning his 
experience in eight concentration camps. 

During his time in the concentration 
camps, Faber was witness to numerous tor-
tures and killings. He said he was forced to 
ex tract the gold fillings from the mouths of 

d~reased Jews. He also said he lost many 
friends during hi s experiences in the camps. 

"Every time I had a friend, I felt like I 
was a jinx to them; they all died," Faber said. 

He also spoke of the death march, in 
which he and other prisoners were forced to 
walk for II days and nights from one con-
centration camp to another. Ninety-five per-
cent of the prisoners died on this march, and 
those who survived were ordered to go into 
a ditch filled with green acid, Faber said . 

''The Nazis said, 'get disinfected, dirty 
Jews, you smell' . But r thought that if r 
plugged my nose and ears, [ could survive. 
And I did," Faber said. 

British troops liberated Bergen-Belsen, 
the last camp in which Faber was a prisoner, 
on April 15, 1945. Faber said this date is a 
day of liberation and remembrance for him. 

Faber said his experiences and memories 
of the Holocaust remained a sigrificant part 
of he life after he moved to the United States 
in 1957. Twenty-five years after the death of 
his brother, the German Consulate requested 
that Faber serve as a witness in the case of 
the man who betrayed Romek and con-

Lai came to UCSD from Japan. 
Her family sti II resides in Japan, 
but has come to the United States 
to take care of funeral proceed-
ings. Barnell -Terry said that, in 
addition to the family's grief, they 
have been struggling to deal with 
the bureaucracy involved with a 
person's death in the United 
States. 

" We are doing what we possibly 
can to help the family through this 
very difficuh situation," Barnell -
Terry said. 

Lai , who was a writer for the 

Nazis, Romek helped destroy ship-
ments of heavy water - a necessity 
in the construction of an atomic 
bomb. Javits said Romek saved thou-
sands of lives. Faber said that 
although he was overwhelmed by the 
pain of remembranCe, he knew that 
his memories were important. 

As a result of his testimony, 
Faber said he began to record his 
memories of the Holocaust on tape. 
The II cassettes that he recorded 
later became the book that both 
details his survival and fulfills a 
promise to Faber's mother.

Recently, Faber 's book was

this was an accomplishment for

Faber concluded his emotional

Wanted: One Graduation 
Speaker, Anyone Will Do 

Last week, Vice Chancellor of External Relations 
James Langley released a statement announcing the 
cancellation of all-campus commencement. Langley 
said the Commencement Speaker Committee had a 
difficult time attracting a speaker comparable to the 
two previous commencement speakers, President 
Bill Clinton and Speaker of the House Newt 
Gingrich. 

"We were unsuccessful in finding a commence-
ment speaker of the stature that we had wanted," 
Langley said. 

What the committee fails to see is the nature of the 
all-campus commencement. The ceremony is not an 
event held only to bring Nelson Mandela, Bill Cosby 
or Toni Morrison to speak at UCSD, though that would 
be nice. UCSD's all-campus commencement is an 
opportunity for graduating seniors to come together as 
a unified UCSD to celebrate a common accomplish-
ment. 

Thomas Bond, Revelle Provost, said that gradua-
tion should spotlight the students rather than a speak-
er. The Guardian agrees. It is unfair for the commit-
tee, so entrenched in its effort to secure a "headliner," 
to forget the very individuals for whom it is working. 
While it is true that graduating seniors care about 
who the commencement speaker is, as became 
painfully apparent last year, most seniors would 
rather have a decent speaker than no speaker, and 
therefore no all-campus commencement, at all . 

It is admirable that the committee holds such high 
standards and claims to want only the best for UCSD 
students; however, it is inexcusable to deny graduating 
students, both graduate and undergraduate, the opportu-
nity to rejoice as a singular, successful UCSD class. The 
all-campus graduation is one last opportunity for UCSD 
seniors to unite five colleges into one community. 

It is difficult to believe that UCSD, with all its 
influence and might, was unable to attract anyone to 
speak at graduation. If the committee was truly dedi-
cated to seniors and truly wanted to have an ail-cam-
pus commencement, it would have asked more than 
five individuals to speak at graduation; it would have 
found someone. There are number of great individu-

• als on campus who would have filled the podium 
nicely - Troupe, Lipsitz, Schudson, Doppelt, Snyder, 
Irons, Sebald, Saltman. 

Barbara Sawrey, professor of chemi try and a mem-
ber of the committee, believes that the committee start-
ed its search late, which may have hindered its attempts 
to attract a high-caliber speaker. Langley agreed. 

"We started the committee last fall but needed to 
start much earlier, like around this time of the year." 

We at the GUllrdian agree, and to keep such a failure 
from occuni g next year, here's a list of individuals to 
begin calling: John F. Kennedy Jr., Steve Jobs, David 
Ho, Bill Maher, Tony Gwynn, Jesse Jackson, Barbara 
Boxer, Craig Kilborn or even Monica Lewinsky.

TAX FORMS FRUSTRATE AND 
CONFOUND FIRST-TIME FILlERS 
COMMENTARY: 
Tricky income taxes 
prevent students from 
enjoying their spring 
By Brook Garrettson 
Staff Writer 

One of the benefit s of getting 
through college is .that the ultimate 
goal, a career and a paycheck, is in our 
grasp. The warmth of the prospect of 
becoming a "real" citizen overcomes 
the uncertainty of what the future 
brings beyond school. 

Then your parents inform you that 
they can no longer save on their taxes 
by claiming you as a dependent. It 
goes something like, "Guess what 
(your name here), you get to do your

Now wait a minute. I just spent 10

Board have made me into an

Welcome to the beginning of a

now, wait until you start working. 
Welcome to springtime hell. 

A quick glance over the forms 
leads to the immediate question, 
aren't I too poor to be able to fill out 
all these spaces? And what about all

year to throw the IRS out of our lives 
and offer a real tax cut. It was whittled 
down to almost nothing so that it 
would not suffer another veto. My 
self-pity is turning to a sort of 
oppressed rage. 

This credit is worth taking since 
one-fifth of your total tuition expenses 
can be applied toward your owed 
taxes. In order to take the credit, one 
must, you guessed it, fi~1 oul another 

cryptic form! Going through il 
reminds me of the math section .of the 
GRE, except here you must get a per-
fect score or face an unhappy call from 
the IRS. 

By ihe way, do not bother Iilling 
out the Earned Income Credit work-
sheet if you are taking the educational 
credits. I got to the end of this really 
crappy form , only to lind out that I 
was not eligible to use it or take any of 
the credit. Do they hire people who 
specialize in designing such contorted 
and frustrating ronns? Do they laugh 
when they think of all ttie misery they 
cause people? 

As you finally near the end of your 
arduous task, you start patting yourself 
on the back. But just when you 
thought it possible to becom~ a tax 
master, you find (on a whim) that an 
even larger, more daunting stack of 
federal and state forms await you . 
Adding to the discomfort, the state 
fonns are tentative as they are subject 
to a law to be passed that could elimi-
nate their purpose retroactively, which 
means what exactly? It seems impossi-
ble to not break the law no matter what 
one does. 

Want an accountant yet? 
Frustrated and stressed out, I 

crawled to student legal services in 
Student Center B and begged for 
help. For the first time this year there 
was a couple of IRS-trained profes-
sionals to help students file their tax 
forms . During this week appoint-
ments were available on a walk-in 
basis. 

A sense of relief pervaded my body 
when I found out I was not going to 
die, that I just had to approach each 
fonn one at a time. 

If it took 1,300 words to declare the 
'indepenc;lence of the United States of 
America and 178,000 words to make 
up the Holy Bible, then why do we 
need a 7,OOO,OOO-word tax code to pay

recent price hike I actually faint-
ed. Of course, I was driving at the 
time, but fortunately I was in La 
Jolla so nobody noticed when my 
car suddenly cut across three 
lanes of traffic and smashed into 
the side of Rock BOllom 
Brewery. 

Prices have become so high 
that I can barely afford them. 
even with the handsome salary I 
make writing for the Guardian 
(ahem). In the interest of the pub-
lic good (not to mention my 
urgent need to come up with an 
article to meet my deadline), I've 
decided to use this column as a 
public forum to try and formulate 
a solution to the current gas crisis 
the California consumer is faced 
with . 

Drivers who live in the north-
ern section of the state have been 
hit the hardest by the price 
increase, but they also have the 
easiest solution. All they have to 
do is drive up to Oregon. Not only 
. is the gas cheaper there, but every

You've probably heard about

scheduled for April 30. 
Admittedly, it 's been a while since 
I've read about supply and 
demand and all that other eco-
nomic tripe, but if I remember 
correctly, reduced sales in a free 
market generally lead to increased 
prices: 

"Hey, boss, we didn ' t sell 
enough gas today to meet our 
costs." 

"Really? Oh well , we'll just 
jack the price up another 5 cents 
tomorrow." 

If any of you really feel the

please move to another state.

Okay, so you weren 't really 
thinking that, but let's pretend that 
you were. If you had been think-
ing that, you would no doubt have 
been rather humbled when I retort-
ed: "Sure, and while we ' re at it 
why don ' t we just ask the Serbs to 
stop killing all the Kosovar 
Albanians?" 

If you ' re going to talk about 
greed and oil, you might as well 
start with OPEC. The fact is, the 
13 nations who are members of 
OPEC own roughly 40 percent of 
the world's oil, but the leaders of 
these nations rarely share the ben-
efits of this wealth with their aver-
age citizens. 

For example, Kuwait , that 
scrappy little country we rescued 
from Iraq during the Persian Gulf 
War, was ranked fifth in'Lhe world 
in terms of Gross Domestic 
Product per capita (right behind 
the United States), but 54th in 
tenns of quality of life by the 
United Nations . 

Hello. communists, are you 

paying attention? Shouldn't you 
guy stop pestering the evil capi-
talist pigs in the West and go 
after these jerks instead? Get off 
your lazy Marxist asses and do 
something for the proletariat out 
there. 

If Lenin could see what a shab-
by state the revolution against the 
bourgeoi ie is in, he'd probably 
roll over in his Plexiglas grave. Of 
course, he 'd probably be more 
upset about the way the Russians 
botched the whole Soviet Union 
thing and how he's been pickled 
and on public display for the past 
75 years. However. I'm sure he 'd 
be able to - pare some ti me to 
express his indignation over how 
the workers in the oil nations of 
the world are going unappreciat-
ed. 

'So, to summarize, if you want 
to do your part to help reduce oil 
prices, you'd better be one of King 
Fahd Bin Abdul Aziz AI-Saud's 
poker buddies or have a military 
force the size of NATO. 

Gas prices aren ' t going up 
because gas station managers have 
decided to skim a little extra 
money ' off the top, or because the 
C~O of Chevron is saving up to 
buy that tropical island he's 
always wanted, or because those 
pesky gas Gremlins have been 
swit.ching around the numbers on 
the price signs again. Gas is 
expensive because the oil needed 
to make it just isn ' t there. 

Please adjust your political 
agenda accordingly.

TAXES: 
Upon graduating, the 
situation gets worse 
Continued from pall- 4 
our taxes? 

The only consolation is that we 
are not alone in our misery. 
According to California 
Congressman Howard Kaloogian, 
the average American spends over 
40 hours preparing his or her taxes 
each year at an annual cost of over 
$350 billion. This drain on the 
economy could have been averted · 
by fi scal year 2001 if just one 
more senator had passed 
Congress' resolution to di sband 
the current tax code. 

California now uses an esti -
mate of your projected income to 
pre-calculate your owed tax. The 
law is written in such a way that 
future-earned money belongs to 
the state from the get-go and not 
to you. They want to pick our 
pockets before our pants are even 
on! 

The best i ' yet to come. It 
should not be surprising that stu-
dents have to pay taxes with their 
loan money. 

Despite all we face as poor stu-
dents paying taxes, the situation 
only gets worse once we leave 
school and start working. We will 
be forced to pay "success taxes," 
which means that the more money 
we make, the greater percentage of 
that money we have to pay to the 
government. 

This progressive, tax-rate 
schedule was first hypothesized by 

. Lenin at the tum of the century. 
Even though communism is dead,

TAXES: 
Even in death, the 
IRS is merciless 
Continued from .... ,. 5 
Lenin 's lax scheme still li ves on. 

In fac~, the average American 
pays 40 percent of hi s or her 
income in taxes. When someone 
paid 32 percent of their income in 
taxes in the Midd le Ages, they 
were considered serfs. 

After we have our visi t by the 
grim reaper, the IRS comes along 
to collect a hefty death ·tax on any 
after-tax money we did not spend 
while still alive. 

The Federal Reserve Act was 
pa sed as the 16th amendment in 
1913. Before then, there were only 
three legal taxes - import and 
export duties and excise taxes. At a 
tlat rate of only I percent, the new 
income tax seemed harmless. If 
those who voted for the amend-
ment could only see the can of 
worms they opened in giving gov-
ernment the unlimited ability to 
expand .... 

So where does our tax lnaney 
go"!

because it is a division of the pri-
vately held Federal Reserve. They 
found that their books are slightly 
out of balance - by a few hundred 
billion dollars. The lirst time the 
U.S. government completed an 
audi t of itself was this year and 
their books were missing a meager 
$3.4 trillion (Washington TImes , 
AprilS-II , 1999). That is 10 times 
more than all income tax revenues 
from 1997! 

This state of affairs certainly is 
not consistent with the vision of 
limited taxation and government 
that our nation 's forefathers had. 
One of them correctly stated that 
"the power to tax is the power to 
destroy." Wiih over one-fifth of the 
country on government payrolls 
and less than half of the nation 
supporting the system of govern-
ment entitlements, many 
Americans are discouraged from 
increasing their income or suc-
ceeding at all. 

Unaccounted-for billions cou-
pled with the nasty way the IRS 
deals with individual taxpayers has 
lead many in Congress to push for 
the abolition of the IRS. 

Could there be life without 
income tax? Before our income 
was taxed, it was not the job of 

Thursday, April 15, 1999 

government to provide a safety 
net for (hose who were lef' 
behind. The community ant 
church took it upon themselves to 
take care of the less fortunate. 
That love and responsibi lity for 
the common man must be revived 
in order for us to come out from 
under the burden of working live 
months of the year to pay for gov-
ernment spending. It would be 
more democratic if citizens could 
decide how to spend their money 
by personally helping people 
instead of having the government 
do it for them. 

Luckily, the drive to raise our 
federal taxes has since been ended 
by the Republican-led Congress in 
1994. If we encourage them, our 
taxes should become much less 
burdensome and time-consuming 
in the near future. We owe it to 
those coming after us to give them 
a better income tax system than we 
enjoy. 

So stay cheerful, fellow taxpay-
er. Your overpayment of the gov-
ernment with each paycheck will 
soon be followed by your yearly 
allowance from Uncle Sam in the 
form of a tax refund.

'NEW VOICES, NEW VISIONS' A MUST SEE 
The University Art Gallery exhibits 23 international artists and their eclectic view of the world 
By Susana Cervantes 
Guardian Reporter 

"Wow" is the word to describe 
the new art exhibit , on display 
April 9 th rough May 29 at the on-
campus University Art Gallery. The 
title of the exhibit "New Voices, 
New Vi sions," featuring 23 con-
temporary international artists, is 
an accurate description of the work 
displayed. 

Riveting, impacting, colorful , 
re llective, complex and penetra t-
ing arc a few words that desc ri be 
thi s season's thought-provoking 
displ ay of work. The range of 
media includes photography, 
pai nt ing, sculpture, install ati on 
and video. 

The works address i:;sues such 
as the environment , cultural ident i-
t y and the urban landscape. The 
art ists have chosen enrapturing col-
ors and vi vid subjects in order to 
capture their personal voices and 
visions. The images are so power-
ful they speak to an array of audi-
ences. Viewers are provoked to 

think about the images they see -
art for thought. 

Artis t Carlos Estrada-Vega 
displays a series of vibrant w lors

on canvas . Chris Verene offers a 
six-piece arrangement of chro-
moge ni c print s, ca pturing th e

trays movement in the city and 
the representation of women who 
fa ll prey to it. Jeff Brouws pre-
sents a va riety of American land-
scapes in his fi ve- piece chro-
mogenic prints. 

One piece that is especially 
impacting is Brett Cook-Di zney's 
Separatiolls. This piece refl ects 
the idea of art representing social 
and economic issues, human psy-
chology and human responses -
thus reshaping how people view 
art fo r the new millennium. The 
focus of th is piece is on soc ial 
interaction and dynamics, and the 
art ist conveys th is social message 

both visually and litera lly to his 
viewers. His project consists of 
layi ng out the issues of modern 
society and letting the viewer reac t 
to them. 

Separation.f addrl'sses the issue 
of geographic, cultural, class and 
racial separation in San Diego as a 
result of an increase in population 
and the expansion of the ci ty. He 
utilizes mediums such as photogra-
phy, sketches and paintings made 
with spray enamel and mi xed 
medi a on wood. Included in the 
piece is a collection of written 
interviews. The artist interviewed 
eight different residents of San 
Diego - from Downtown, La Jolla 
and Southeast - about the area in 
which they li ved and why they did 
not visit the other areas of San 
Diego. Cook-Dizney then painted 
these interviews and placed their 
portraits in the parts of town they 
did not frequent. 

In the written component of the 
piece, Cook-Dizney carefully stat-
ed that the purpo e of·the piece was

to reveal why indi viduals are sepa-

viewers, by reading the interviews, 
will be "provoked to address their 
own ideas of g~ographi c, class, cul-
tural , ethnic separation."

.... ck ... ed: Pete Postelhwaite and Rachel Griffiths choose high-wire electrical towers as the base of 
their romance in Fox Searchlight Pictures ' "Among Giants . H 

LOVE AND HEIGHT 
~mong Giants' reveals a bizarre love triangle at high altitudes 

By Christ Ine Kerley 
Staff Writer 

"Among Giants" details a 
romance set 100 feet in the air 
amidst high-wire electrical towers. 
Pete Postlethwaite ("[n the ame 
of the Father") stars as Ray, the 
leader of a rag-tag work crew hired 
to paint the towers. James Thornton 
plays his hest friend Steve. 

The li ves of the these two York-
shire men follow a very strict. mun-
dane rout ine. Middle-aged. sensitive 
Ray seeks odd jobs to support his 
estranged wi fe and children. Young 
and over-sexed Steve tags along to 
subsist in his emotionally empty 
life tyle. Soul- earching Gerry 
(Rachel Griffiths), a hack-packing 
drifter, insists on working with them 
and consequently supplies the cata-
lyst for the ensuing drama. 

Nothing much would have 
changed in their routine had Gerry 
done the ex pected and fallen for 

. Steve's boyish charm and good-
looks. Instead she chooses Ray, the 
emhlem of working class dignity. 

This decision brings out Steve's 
insecurities, and Ray's youthful 
delight in love. the former must re-
evaluate the di rection of his life. 
and the latter must ri sk opening his 
heart again. 

Ray 's and Gerry's relationship 
unfo lds in high altitudes, rellecting 
the heady heights they reach in th is 
exciting romance. The vast expanse 
of the countryside around them 
imbues their love with that thrill ing 
feeling of greatness to which one 
can he moved only by the sight and 
ahsorption of natu re. Sam Miller, 
the fi lm', newcomer director, 
expert ly captures these moments 
with a line sensihi lity of camera-
work and timing. 

As in many lilms, the fee lings of 
the characters arc transferred to the 
viewer. Yet here this phenomena is 
more immediate, thanks to screen-
writer Simon Beaufoy. The charac-
ters do not narrate the evolution of 
their emotions in tedious dialogue a 
la soap opera. The e emotions, how-
ever, are represented with startling 

: ._/$frJII"~If"" 
1 .... ,. _____ _ 
I a.#: _____ _ 
I .. ,..,1IssiI*JII •• ..., 
I ' O 10 _IIssiIO 
I "'''' --". .. *JII." .... ",_ 

clarity because Beaufoy understands 
that emotions are felt, not articulated. 

The viewer must rely on the 
characters' eyes, post ure and si lence 
as the main channels of in fo rmation 
for their feelings. One can ident ify 
wi th these emotions through the 
common human ex pcrience, the 
si lent motion that characterizes the 
movement of the mind. So the li lm 
pushes the emotions of the charac-
ters into the individual's interior 
rea lm of experience. eedless to say 
the acting in the film has to be 
~uperh to accomplish this, and it is. 

Of course, part f the immedia-
cy of the film is its rea lism. one 
of the characters are simple, and 
the plot is lIot too complex, hence 
everything represented is plausible. 
That is not to say that the film is 
without deeper meaning beyond 
the "bizarrc" love triangle. The 
high electrical towers themse lves 
carry many implications in the 
movie. As they ra ise the lovers up 
to ecstasy, they threaten a steep 
emotional fall.

Tonnie Sammanano is a profes- of a woman, from birth to old age. 
sional modem dancer and a teacher Tonnie used her son as a model for 
at UCSD, among other things. This her opening crawl as a wide-eyed 
weekend at Sushi Perfonnance and toddler. 
Visual Art in downtown San Diego "Fats," by George Willis, was 
she performed five solo dances perhaps the most awkward of the 
(read: all alone on stage for two dances, though the large and minia-
hours). Her expert technique and ture white pianos floating randomly 
expressive ingenuity combined were · across the stage were a nice effect. 
enough to cover the large hardwood The last piece by Joe Goode, 
dance floor and fill the spacious titled "I Drempt I Couldn't Go Any 
prop-empty room with life. She has 
won the San Diego Area Dance 
Alliance Tommy Award for "Best 
Modern Dancer" and has also 
received the 1998 "SDADA Student 
of the Year" award from SDSU. The 
enthusiasm and dedication Tonnie 
has given to dancing shows in each . 
movement she makes. 

The panicular movements she 
made last weekend were choreo-
graphed by five accomplished 
choreographers. When Tonnie 
chose who she was going to work 
with, her second solo project, she 
kept in mind the choreographers' 
di ver e approaches to the process 
of choreographing and their differ-
ent styles of creative dance inter-
pretation. The result wa a night 
that juxtapo ed live examples of 
the wide range of movement possi-
ble within the even widcr category 
known as modern dance. 

Nina Martin 's piece, "Secondary 
Surface," was based on the intelli-
gence of movement without any spe-
cific thematic intent. Repetition of 

Higher," was a serious and appropri-
ately climatic ending to the evening. 
The final scene, delivered on a tall 
table in front of the audience, 
involved text taken from moments in 
Tonnie's life and applied to a univer-
sal theme. 

Tonnie did a wonderful job o( 
switiching sensibilities quickly 
between each piece while using her 
versatile body and strength of 
expression to add something that no 
choreographer could request or 
define. 

Although Tonnie Sammartano' 
piece has passed, Sushi Perfonnance 
and Visual Art consistently showcas-
es the most interesting and ground-
breaking of San Diego's art. Call

CIRRUS: 
Band retains high-
profile image 
conti ...... from ..... 7 

Moonshine records was created 
in the eiuly 1990s, labeled mainly as 
a promoting outfit that also used the 
names Truth, Orbit and Flash. Over 
the next several years, Moonshine 
records released some techno com-
pilations that sold consistently well , 
including Teclroo Truth Speed Limit 
140 BPM and Ps),ciwtrance. As the 
techno underground grew in the mid 
1990s, Moonshine signed soon-to-
be big name acts such as Keoki, Carl 
Cox, Electric Skychurch and, of 
course, Cinus. 

Moonshine was also the first 
record label to develop a web site for 
promotional purposes. The web site 
has biographies o( all the major 
artists on Moonshine as well as 
downloadable MP3 format files. 
With the entire record industry up in 
arms concerning the .MP3 format, 

VOICES:

he reverted 10 one particular inter-
view that serves as an example of 
how the inability to recognize 
ignorance causes and perpetuates 
divisions. 

"Ignorance ... is propagated by 
separations and the unknowing 
that comes from not having expe-
riences with different geographics, 
classes, ethnicities and cultures," 
Cook-Dizney stated. 

Moonshine still uses the fonnat as a 
promotional tool. 

"I think right now IMP3s] are 
kind of a cool thing," Carter said. 
")t 's a hrand new way to exploit your 
music, share it with the masses. Now 
in the beginning it's cool. They 
should let that format run until they 
can develop it into something that 's 
more controlled. For now ... let it be 
free, as long as the artists aren't get-
ting hurt." 

The controversy over copyright 
infringement is clearly a moot point 
for Carter. 

'The kind of people who will 
download MP3s and not pay for the 
music are the same people who will 
copy CDs or tapes," Barry said. "It's 
just a different medium, it doesn't 
maUer. I think the more people that 
hear the music, no matter how they 
get it, the beller." 

I had listened to Cinus' latest 
Moonshine release Back on a Mis· 
sion, released las! fall, and found it 
well-executed but unoriginal and 
predictable. Back on a Mission, 

Therefore honesty enables a 
deeper understanding of the divi-
sions and social isslies at hand. 

Everyday our society becomes 
more complex and it is harder to 
sustain a sense of community. 
Cook-Dizney offers a unique 
opportunity for self-reflection on 
how we as people can contributc to 
creating a better society that is 
more inclusive, and less exclusive. 
Getting to know the different peo-
ple that make up our society and 
what makes them tick will enable 
new generations to become better 
community leaders and contribu-
tors.

seems to not have progressed much 
from earlier Cirrus releases like 
1997's Drop tire Beat. 

Cirrus mixes big beat and hreak

But it is not surprising that 
Cirrus has received so much 
attention in the last several years. 
As one of the few high-profi le 
American electronic/techno 
bands, Cirrus is the perfect mix-
ture of pop-techno, hip-hop and 
rock that will sell records and 
bring electronic music further into 
the American mainstream. Since 
American pop radio and MTV are 
barely ready to showcase even the 
catchiest electronic bands like the 
Chemical Brothers, Crystal 
Mcthod and the Prodigy, Cirrus is 
a solid and safe choice for corpo-
rate success, although perhaps not 
for innovation.

UCSD Gets Snubbed 
DAMN: No D-JU playoffs for UCSD this season 
By Bill Burger 
Senior Staff Writer 

Talk about a bad day. On 
Monday night . the TrilOn learned 
that they were not going to be invit -
ed to the Mohen Di vision 
IU Invitational Champion-
ships. and t.he 
next day, they 
had to face area 
rival San Diego State 
Universi ty (SDSU). 

"We were really mad because 
everyone knows we were a beller 
team than [La Verne Uni versity]," 
sophomore Zack Hite said. "We 
wanted to go out there and prove 
something to the committee." 

With the anguish of being 
snubbed still smoldering, the 
Tritons started strong against the 
Aztecs before falling in three 
games 10-15,5- 15,4-15. 

The first game began in a very 
promising fashion as the Tritons 
took an early 5-3 lead on a stuff 
block by Hite and Bill Sinclair. 
After three consecuti ve hitting 
errors by the Aztecs and a yellow 
card for SDSU Coach Jack Henn. 
the Tritons were up 8-3 and could 
smell a victory. 

A well-used time-out by SDSU 
got the Aztecs back on track, as 
they won nine of the next 10 points 
to surge ahead of the Tritons 12-9. 

service ace to pu II the Tritons back 
within two. Unfortunately. that was 
as close a the Tritons would get -
they surrendered the next 3 poi nts 
and lost the game 10-15. 

UCSD wa led in game 
one by out ide hitter Hite, 

who brought in 7 
kills , whi le 
Sinclair claimed 

the next highest total for 
the Tritons with 2 kills. As 

a whole, the Tritons had 15 kills 
and 10 hitting errors, while the 
Aztecs totaled 20 kills and 10 hit-
ting errors. 

In game two, the Aztecs started 
out hot, getting out to a 4-1 lead. 
Unfortunately, the Aztecs then put 
together another run. This time, 
they took seven of the next 8 points 
to all but put the Tritons away. 
UCSD could muster only one more 
point the rest of the way, and they 
eventually fell , 5-15. 

The Tritons came out flat in the 
third game and before anyone 
blinked an eye, the score was 12-2 
in favor of SDSU, and the match 
was all but over. SDSU eventually 
triumphed 4-15. 

The Tritons were led offensive-
ly by Hite, who iotaled II such 
kills, I ace and 5 digs. Senior seller 
Kurt Seckington chipped in with I 
kill , 33 assists and 2 digs. 

The UCSD Guardian 

BASICS: 
Fundamentals lead 
to good victory 
Continued from PllCe 16 
Ryan Hill , who recorded the 
put-out of the runner from sec-
ond unassisted, and then flipped 
to Kenny Fluharty who threw 
back to Eric Thorpe for the tri-
fecta. The Tritons also had a 13-
hit parade in their victory. 
Fluharty was 4 for 5 with 2 
RBIs and Chad Addison, who 
has now performed well enough 
at the plate to earn starting time 
in the outfield, went 3 for 4. 

The Triton lineup was solid 
all around with hitters one 
through five all gelling hits 
behind freshman pitcher 
Andrew Holloway in his first 
start of the year. The young 6'2" 
hurler went seven ilmings for 
the win - increasing his record 
to 2-1 - while allowing only 
one earned run on 6 hits. 
Reliever Brian Hinson replaced 
Dave Takehara . with 2 outs in 
the eighth inning after the 
Vanguards scored a run and 
went on to close the contest with 
his third save of the season. 

The Tritons scored all five of 
their runs in different innings, 
beginning in the top of the first 
with a lead-off double by 
Fluharty. 

In an effort to regain the team's 
lost momentum, UCS D Head 
Coach Jon Stevenson inserted 
junior Donald Chen into the lineup, 
who paid instant dividends with a 

"We might have had a letdown," 
said Hite of his team 's performance 
on Tuesday. "We worked all year 
for something that everyone feels 
we deserved and didn ' t receive." 

- . Usa Huff/ Guardl8f1 

"With three weeks left in the 
season, it would be great to kick 
it into high gear and run the 
tables," said Assistant Coach 
Brian Priebe. "Wins and losses 
are not as important as the qual-
ity of play and playing as good 
as we are capable of." SpMk: OutSide hitter Zack Hite led UCS~n kills against SDSU.

Let's Play Some Overtime 
MORE: Tritons play four overtime periods before loSing to SDSU 6-7 
By Sarah Hollne 
Staff Writer 

Sometimes the regulation period just isn' t 
enough; some teams need more time in the 
pool to show their SlUff. UCSD women's 
water polo is one of these teams, evi-
denced by its amazing ability to 
take most of its opponents 
into overtime. So far, out 
of 16 games this season, 
four have gone to extra time and 
even sudden death. So when ero s-
town rival San Diego State University 
(SDSU) went head-to-head wi th UCSD again 
yesterday, overtime seemed inevitable. 

The outcome, however, was still in doubt 
- UCSD had only a 2-2 record in these 
extended contests, and that dropped to 2-3 
when SDSU defeated the Tritons 6-7 in sud-
den death. Unlike SDSU's domination of 
UCSD during a preseason scrimmage, the 
women came back with a vengeance in the 
rematch, dragging the Aztecs into double 
overtime and twq periods of sudden death. 

The game gained added suspense due to the 
matchups outside the pool. Carin Crawford, the 
Aztecs' new head coach, was an All-American 
and Athlete of the Year during her time as a stu-
dent at UCSD, and played under current UCSD 
Head Coach Denny Harper. 

In the match, Dara Burch scored in the last 
minute of th fourth quarter, whieh tied the 
teams and brought them into overtime. Also 
scoring for the Tritons were freshmen Erin 
Welsh, Emma Kudritzki and senior Jenny 
Irwin. Maryam Hadiashar also played a stellar 
game in goal, blocking many tough shots 
against the Aztecs. 

The game was close throughout its entire-
ty, but the Tritons played catch-up after the 
first quarter, which ended 3-2 in favor of the 

Aztecs. In each quarter thereafter, both teams 
kept it even, scoring one goal each until 
UCSD finally evened it up. The team then 
went into two three-minute quarters of over-

time. The next six minute proved 
unfruitful for both team , however, 

and the tie remained unbroken. 
The. teams then wen! 

into udden death - a three 
minute quarter in which 
whate~er team scores first wins. 

Still, no goals were scored. Finally, in a 
second period of sudden death, SDSU's Sara 

Hanneman scored, ending the epic battle. 
Despite the loss, Harper was pleased with 

the level of play his team exhibited ye terday. 
"I fccl really good about where we' re at 

right now," Harper said. "If we remain focused 
and keep playing good water polo we could 
make it back to the national competition." 

This past weekend, the women's water 
polo team traveled to Bakersfield to play in 
the Western Water Polo Association 
Championship Tournament. A bit sluggish 
after not playing in two weeks, the Tritons 
warmed up against Claremont-Mudd-Scripps, 
beati ng them 8-5. 

In the semi-finals, UCSD again triumphed 
8-5 over University of Redlands. It was an 
impressive victory - Redlands is a three-
time Division U National Champion. 

Going up against UC Davis in the champi-
onship game, the Tritons again took a team 
into overtime, but lost 5-7 . The team played a 
very good game overall - Irwin defended 
two-meter well and the overall defense 
stepped up. 

"Our team is finally seeing that they can 
play these kind of games and beat these kind 
of teams," Assistant Coach Larry Sanders 
said. "Suddenly we're just coming together."

Close: Senior Ping Yeh eyes a volley in his No.3 singles match against Palomar College. UCSD was down 3-0 when Yeh sparked a UCSD comeback win with his 6-4, 
6-3 triumph. After Yeh , No. 4, 5 and 6 singles players Brain Crain, Vincent Darmohusado and Ari Frankel all. won to give UCSD a hard-fought comeback 4-3 victory. 

By Bill Burger 
Senior Staff Writer 

One or two great players are usually 
not enough to win in sports. The UCSD 
tennis team reiterated that fact to the play-
ers of Palomar College on Wednesday. 
Despi te losing at No. I and 2 singles, as 
well as at No. I doubles, the Triton depth 
proved to be too much for Palomar as 
UCSD managed to pull out a hard-fought 
4-3 victory. 

Due to injuries to many Triton pla),ers, 
Mike Rosell teamed up with Steve Shabel 
for the first time this year at No. I doubles. 
Shabel and Rosell hung tough the entire 
proset, but eventually fell 8-6. 

No. 2 doubles featured Brian Crain and 
Ping Yeh taking on Palomar College's Walt 
Hearn and Aaron Coyle. Crain and Yeh 
turned in a superlative effort,and were the 
only UCSD doubles team to win on the day, 

Despite losing doubles and their flNt two singles 
matches, a very deep Triton squad came back from 
0-3 to beat Palomar College 4-3 

as they went on to an 8-4 victory. this year and has been the Triton's most

admirably. Darmohusado and ................ Rosell played No.2 singles for

within striking distance, but position all season. Early on,
