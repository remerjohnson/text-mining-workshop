Clad in blue and gold armbands and cus-
tomized caution tape, about 100 students, fac-
ulty and staff gathered at the steps of Peterson 
Hall last Thursday for an hour-long teach-in 
addressing the effects of the budget crisis. 

While the coinciding walkout was heavily 
attended by students, only an estimated 40 under-
graduates attended the teach-in. The rest of the 
assembly was made up of faculty and staff. 

Communications professor Brian Goldfarb, 
who helped organize the teach-in, said it was an 
event intended to educate and inform.

“We had questions, but we were not trying 
to promote one particular way of dealing with 
it, because it’s a long-term issue,” Goldfarb said. 
“The call for a strike or a walkout was generated 
by faculty on other campuses. [Some faculty] 
thought the first day of action was not the best 
day, but it was nothing we could really stop.” 

THIS IS DISSENT

UC BUDGET CRISIS CAMPUS WALKS OUT IN PROTEST

Faculty and students at all 10 UC campuses marked the first day of classes 
Sept. 24 — except UC Berkeley 
and UC Merced, which employ 
the semester system — with 

mass protests 
targeting UC 
President Mark 
G. Yudof and 
the Board of 
Regents.

The UCSD 
walkout began 

with a midday rally in front of 
Gilman Parking Structure, and 
continued as over 200 protes-
tors marched up Library Walk 
to Peterson Hall.

The two-hour demonstra-
tion culminated in conflict as 
groups of protesters marched 
into classrooms and demand-
ed that teachers and students 
walk out. 

Carolan Buckmaster, 
president of the Union of 
Professional and Technical 
Employees San Diego chapter, 
said the number of protestors 
had increased to about 300 by 
the end of the demonstration.

Systemwide, the walkouts 
attracted about 7,000 students 
— 4,000 less than organizers 
had originally expected. 

Faculty and staff voiced 
concern over salary reduc-

tions that are hurting lower-
paid employees, the prohibi-
tion of mandatory furloughs 
during instructional days and 
the  perceived decline in edu-
cational quality at the uni-
versity. 

“I’m worried about access 
and affordability,” literature 
professor Shelley Streeby said. 
“A lot of hardworking students 
that deserve to be here can’t 
be. This [university] is a good 
investment. It is stupid not to 
invest in education.”

Student objections focused 
primarily on Yudof ’s proposed 

ONLINE
Exclusive 
video of the 
walkout, 
including 
classroom 
occupation.

For the people of the 
state of California, this 
is the access univer-

sity — the democratic access 
university — and it’s being eroded. 
It began long before this budget 
crisis began, but the budget crisis 
pushes it to a head.”

We hear you. You want the 
Guardian, like UC Berkeley’s Daily

POORLY DRAWN LINES By Reza Farazmand

RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE By Philip Rhie

Provides a steady stream of 
vague political buzz 
words and jumbled 
pseudo-revolutionary 
catch phrases. Displays 
remarkable rhyming skills 
while striking dramatic 
poses for any nearby 
photographers. Would 
make an excellent high-
school cheerleading 
coach.

Insists on dragging 
around a Che Guevara 
ﬂ ag everywhere she 
goes, regardless 
of what’s being pro-
tested. Unfair labor 
practices? Che. Global 

warming? Che. Small-
pox vaccinations for 
inbred poodles? Che was 
surely into that shit. 
Let’s invoke his image.

Skeptical. Dissenting. Kind 
of wierd-looking. Works his 
way through the crowd loudly 
criticizing every picket sign 
while presenting mountains of 
semi-bullshit counterevidence 
in an attempt to brutally piss 

people off. Appears to enjoy 
being yelled at by large groups 
of angry protestors. Probably 
into bondage sex.

Latches onto any protest, 
demonstration, or rally she 
can ﬁ nd. Doesn’t actually 
possess any values of her 
own. 

Overheard saying: “Let’s 
hippie this shit up a bit. 
Anyone got some sage 
to burn?”

He’s not really sure 
what he’s doing here 
— he’s just glad 
to be a part of 

something. Silently 
mouths protest 
slogans in an attempt 

to blend with the crowd.  

Overheard saying: What 
are we protesting, again? 
Silicon breast implants? 

Cool. Lemme get a sign.

Launches into a series of 
rambling, nostalgia-fueled 
sermons about “the power 
of youth” and “the equal-
ity of the masses,” what-
ever the #$%@ that is. 
Begins every sentence 
with “Back in the ’60s.” 
Captivates listeners 

simply by virtue of how 
haggard he looks.

32-percent student-fee increase that 
would be fully implemented by Fall 
2010, if approved by the UC Board of 
Regents this academic year. 

“I think that whatever your major, 
you will be affected by the bud-
get cuts,” John Muir College junior 
Traci Kim said. “The budget cuts 
affect everyone’s education. I wish 
that students would think about the 
things that affect the world outside 
their own class, their own grade and 
their own depart-
ment.”

Chants of “Lay 
off Yudof ” and 
“Yudof must go” 
broke out dur-
ing the rally as 
the crowd began 
to call students 
out of lecture 
halls and into the 
crowd. 

“[Yudof] has 
his head stuck 
in the sand and 
seems unwilling to 
deal with the issue 
at hand, so if he’s 
not going to step 
up to the plate and do his job, then we 
need someone else who is going to,” 
literature graduate student Andrea 
Dominguez said.

However, Dominguez added that 
Yudof is not the only one at fault 
for the university’s current financial 
predicament.

“We are all responsible for what 
happens on this campus. The stu-
dents and teachers allow it to func-
tion,” visual arts professor Micha 
Cardenas said. 

A number of instructors contin-
ued to hold class despite the com-
motion. Other faculty members dis-
missed their students from class, 
encouraging them to attend the 
teach-in being held concurrently at 

Pepper Canyon Hall.
“I do think that many faculty are 

divided on how they should respond 
to the convergence between student, 
faculty and service workers’ griev-
ances,” literature professor John 
Blanco said. “Some [faculty] depend 
on state funding, others don’t; some 
can afford to live comfortably with-
out a percentage of their annual sal-
ary; others can’t.”

Literature graduate student and 
long-time campus activist Benjamin 

Balthaser was 
pleased with 
Thursday’s turn-
out.

“Students and 
educators in the 
UC system are 
starting to wake 
up to the fact that 
their right to an 
affordable, high 
quality education 
and a secure work-
place has been 
stolen,” Balthaser 
said. “It has 
reached a break-
ing point now.”

Rally leaders 
encouraged members of the crowd 
on Library Walk to attend a meeting  
Wednesday evening in the Cross-
Cultural Center to discuss their next 
course of action.

“[I think the next step should be] 
contacting elected officials,” litera-
ture graduate student Adam Lewis 
said. “We need a coalition of faculty, 
students and staff to come together 
to form a concrete list of demands. 
Educating people through more 
teach-ins and protests will be a good 
way to encourage greater support 
and keep the pressure on state and 
university policymakers.”

Students, faculty and staff joined in a mass protest Sept. 24 to voice their contentions with budget cuts to the university and proposed increases in 
student fees. Many called for the removal of UC President Mark G. Yudof, who — along with the UC Board of Regents — has implemented furloughs 
for professors and union workers over the last year. Yudof has also suggested two separate increases in student fees, to be voted on in coming months. 
Protestors stormed lectures in Peterson Hall and Center Hall, interrupting class to call for fellow students to join the demonstration. 



NEWS� MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 2009� THE UCSD GUARDIAN 7 

By Sarah Smith
Associate News Editor

A bill recently approved in the 
House of Representatives would 
force colleges to overhaul their pub-
licly funded student-loan programs 
— requiring a switch from govern-
ment-subsidized private lenders to the 
Federal Direct Loan Program.

Passed in the House on Sept. 17, the 
Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility 
Act would originate all new federal 
student loans through the Direct Loan 
Program starting next year, mean-
while eliminating the Federal Family 
Education Loan Program altogether.

The bill is designed to dramatically 
increase the number of college gradu-
ates in the United States by 2020.

“No student in America should 
have to mortgage their future to get a 
good education,” Rep. George Miller 
(D-CA), chair of the House Education 
and Labor Committee and the author 

of the bill, said in a statement. “This 
legislation provides students and fami-
lies with the single largest investment 
in federal student aid ever and makes 
landmark investments to improve edu-
cation for students of all ages, and all 
without costing taxpayers a dime.”

Supporters of the bill argue that 
the Direct Loan Program will insu-
late interest rates from changes in the 
economy, guaranteeing students access 
to affordable college loans. 

According to estimates from the 
Congressional Budget Office, the bill 
will generate $87 billion in savings 
over 10 years by eliminating the cost of 
subsidizing private loans. 

Additionally, the legislation will 
invest $40 billion to increase the maxi-
mum annual Pell Grant scholarship 
from its current amount of $5,350 to 
$5,550 in 2010 and $6,900 by 2019. 

The bill would also support various 
college access and completion support 
programs, strengthen the Perkins Loan 

program, simplify the Free Application 
for Federal Student Aid application 
process, implement variable interest 
rates on need-based loans and provide 
loan forgiveness for members of the 
military who are called to duty in the 
middle of an academic year.

It would also provide funding to 
community colleges, public-school 
modernization and pre-kindergarten 
education. 

“Today the House made a clear 
choice to stop funneling vital taxpayer 
dollars through board rooms and start 
sending them directly to dorm rooms,” 
Miller said. “This vote was a historic 
triumph for America’s students, fami-
lies and taxpayers, and will ensure that 
their interests never again take a back-
seat to lenders and big banks.” 

UCSD, UCLA and UCSF are cur-
rently the only UC campuses still 
using the Federal Family Education 
Loan Program. All others have already 
switched to the Direct Loan Program.  

Financial Aid Office Director Ann 
Klein said UCSD is currently evaluat-
ing its business processes to determine 
how to make the transition to the 
Direct Loan Program.

Klein said the bill would not greatly 
affect the availability of student loans. 

“If UCSD moves to the [Direct 
Loan] Program, students would still 
be able to receive student loans with 
very similar terms and benefits,” Klein 
said in an e-mail. “Let us reassure our 
students that loan funds would be 
available if this bill passes and UCSD 
moves to the [Direct Loan] Program. 
Student access to loan funding would 
not be impacted.”

The Senate received the bill on 
Sept. 21 and referred the bill to the 
Committee on Health, Education, 
Labor and Pensions. It is awaiting 
approval in the Senate.

sjs001@ucsd.edu.

About a dozen faculty members 
spoke on issues ranging from con-
cern over the new furlough plan to 
rising student fees, and presented 
possible ways to confront the per-
ceived long-term privatization of the 
university. 

“Turning around the privatiza-
tion that has been occurring over the 
past 25 to 30 years is going to take 
another decade, but this is a good 
time to start,” Goldfarb said. “There 
is a certain silver lining of this as a 
wake-up call.” 

Faculty discussed various alter-
native solutions to plummeting state 
funding, including an enrollment 
plan modeled after the University of 
Michigan — one that would signifi-

cantly increase out-of-state enroll-
ment and create revenue. Others 
argued that such a system wouldn’t 
work in California. 

Visual arts professor Micha 
Cardenas voiced support for an alter-
native budget proposal created by 
AFSCME that would utilize profits 
from the five UC Medical Centers 
and only cut salaries above $200,000. 

Cardenas also encouraged stu-
dents and faculty to go on a pro-
longed strike in order to cause maxi-
mum systemwide disruption. 

“A one-day walkout will create 
some bad press [for the university] and 
cost them some money, but tomorrow 
will be business as usual unless faculty 
and staff go on a longer strike, which is 
what I hope happens,” she said. 

In addition to possibly increased 
fees, students are also witnessing the 
impact of the cuts on current course 
instruction. 

“The faculty-student ratio has 
increased enormously over the last 
couple of decades,” Goldfarb said. 
“Places like Texas are taking our fac-
ulty, and we can’t get them back. 
We’re facing real huge losses.” 

Literature professor Fatima 
El-Tayeb e-mailed her students 
before classes started last week to 
inform  them that she could no 
longer hold meetings with students 
outside of office hours because of 
the strict limitations placed on fur-
lough days. 

She is also posting class mate-
rial online instead of requiring text-
books, in an effort to limit costs for 
students. 

Like many professors, El-Tayeb 
held class on Thursday, but dedi-

cated part of her lecture to educat-
ing students about the walkout and 
explaining the effects of the budget 
cuts on education. 

“There were very few people 
who strictly walked out,” Goldfarb 
said. “What many of them did was 
create curricular units in their class 
based on the economic issues facing 
California and the education system. 
There is a very strong educational 
component to this event.” 

A larger, more comprehensive, 
systemwide teach-in is planned for 
Oct. 14. Future events and updates to 
the budget situation can be found at

ILLUSTRATIONS BY KIM CYPRIAN/GUARDIAN

Things became a bit less clear 
amid the shouts and signage of the 
angry mob last Thursday. Union 
workers, Cross-Cultural Center rep-
resentatives, YouTube-hit hopefuls, 
professors and graduate students from 
the artier departments, Student Voice! 
green-shirters — and everybody else 
who didn’t want to go to class — wove 
causes across campus, out-shouting 
each other and passing out protest 
paraphernalia like it was candy.

We asked a small sect of protes-
tors toting “Fees Are Racist” signs to 
explain how the cuts related to race; 
they replied that they didn’t know, 
and that someone had just handed 
them the signs. (It’s true: The U.S. 
capitalist system generally ensures 
minorities the lowest-paying, least 
valued positions and a much rougher 
road to higher education. In this way, 
furloughs and admission cutbacks will 
have a graver effect on minority popu-
lations — but that’s a massive econom-

ic issue that can’t be solved by Yudof 
alone, especially with anti-affirmative 
action nazis breathing down his neck.)

Which brings us to the next shod-
dily markered posterboard to catch 
our eye: “Yudof Hitler: Education Is 
Not Just for the Elite.” 

Hitler? Really? Unemployment can 
hardly be equated to mass genocide. 
Even less extreme jabs at the UC 
president — “Lay off Yudof,” “Cut 
Yudof, Not Education” — were igno-
rant to the fact that greater evils in the 
system exist than one stolid, bald con-
servative could be solely responsible 
for. (And lord knows there’ll always 
be another to replace him.) The only 
way the masses can change money-
minded policy up top is if policymak-
ers feel their security legitimately 
threatened by a group of unified, rea-
sonable individuals. A pissed-off herd 
of misinformed rebels without cause 
or direction isn’t exactly going to have 
the regents shaking in their boots. 

The Guardian editorial board has 

long vocalized its “official” stance on 
raising student fees or slashing from 
academics: It must be the very, very 
last resort. At this point, we firmly 
believe that Yudof and the regents 
have not done everything within 
their power to avoid the looming 32 
percent fee increase and the crippling 
blows currently being dealt to course 
quality/availability. We will need to 
have seen UC leaders hunger-striking 
on the White House doorstep and 
cutting their own salaries and benefits 
to common-man sleights before it will 
be acceptable for them to inflate the 
cost of public (if exceptional, up to 
now) higher education.

Why did university officials 
change admission requirements last 
spring to include those high-school 
applicants with fewer educational 
resources if they were just planning 
on spitting in all those newly eligible 
faces with a five-figure yearly tuition 
bill come fall? Yudof has proposed a 
larger financial-aid pool to accom-

pany the new fees, but the two only 
cancel each other out to become just 
as unaffordable as they are now. His 
Blue and Gold Plan — which covers

NATIONAL NEWS — With a university president 
who’s asking for buckets more of our money every 
quarter and a governor who wants to share buckets 
less (it was fun while it lasted, Cal Grants), the stu-
dent loan has never been more important. 

Thankfully, our friends at the House of 
Representatives seem well aware. They passed a bill 
on Sept. 17 that would both expand federal aid and 
invest some much-needed cash into higher education 
by revamping the student-loan system. 

But even though the Senate looks prepped to pass 
the bill and send it up to President Obama for the final 
OK, Republican dissent still echoes loud and clear.

Of course, we should be skeptical to a certain 
extent of such sweeping legislation: Two-thirds of 
our nation’s student body rely on loans to graduate, 
so it’s important that our legislators proceed with 
caution. The Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility 
Act of 2009 does, however, devote $3.25 billion to 
limiting interest rates on student loans, and puts a 
firm 6.8 percent cap on them as well — though many 
students would pay far under that maximum.

Funding would come from eliminating pri-
vate lending, which would save an estimated $80 
billion. Instead of going through banks for student 
loans, we’d be borrowing from the nation’s own 
bank account, rather than from companies like 
Chase and Sallie Mae, who are only in it to turn 
a profit. Not that a business setting out to make 
money is an unreasonable prospect, but we 
can’t afford to allow indirect lenders to capi-
talize on students — especially if Uncle Sam’s 
extending a hand full of Benjamins our way.

The Republican argument boils down to 
this: Because the S.A.F.R.A. would end the 
Family Federal Education Loan Program of 
indirect lending that’s been in place since 
1965 (instead, we’d be borrowing from the 
government itself), it will decrease com-
petition  (and thus, loosen standards) and 
remain full of hidden costs. 

It’s an unoriginal argument. Even Rep.

Per usual, I spent the wee hours of Sunday morning munching on leftover Islands fries and 
sympathizing with Taylor Swift on 
YouTube. But just as I was about to 
pass out on my couch, I came across 
an article relating to the one subject 
that trumps all else: Sex.

During this early-morning read, 
I discovered that there is such a job 
as a “sex surrogate” — an instructor 
who charges roughly $200 per hour 
to teach disgruntled Americans how 
to please their partners.

I know what you’re wondering, 
and yes, the clients do get laid by 
their teachers. After about a year of 
awkwardly narrated oral sex, eager 
students face intercourse as a “final 
exam.” And in the words of one of 
the surrogates: “If they pass, they 
graduate.” 

On first thought, I’d call that 
legal prostitution. I mean, come 
on — most of us grow up with a set 
of sexual morals hammered into us 
that can be simplified into a “Just 
don’t do it” slogan. Or at least that’s 
what our parents, teachers and 
Sunday School guides say.

But in this case, can’t we just 
write the sex surrogates off as sluts 
damned to burn in hell? Consider 
the standards that make sex OK. 
Does it need to be with your hus-
band or wife? Someone you’re in 
love with? What about the person 
you think is damn fine as you 
down your 15th shot, despite your 
inability to discern the difference 
between a toilet and a sink? How 
many people can you seduce before 
your little black book is unaccept-
ably thick?

And what’s the difference 
between putting out when someone 
buys you a steak rather than hand-
ing you a twenty?

Sorry, this is getting super 
Carrie Bradshaw. Back to sex 
surrogates. So they can poten-
tially sleep with everyone and your

all student fees for students whose 
families make less than $60,000 a year 
— will exclude students whose parents 
might make a little more, but still can’t 
afford to send their kid to school at 
$10,000 a year, especially considering 
the newly impossible cost of living.

While snaking from Gilman 
Parking Structure to Geisel Library to 
the Chancellor’s Complex, Thursday’s 
mob decided it would be a good idea 
to bust into Peterson Hall and Center 
Hall classrooms and push their slo-
gans onto students who had decided 
to go to class — the majority of whom 
were likely freshmen, or hadn’t caught 
word of the first-day-back protest.

To the dramatic disbelief of 

protestors, students responded to 
their demands to “Walk out!” with 
a resounding, “Fuck you, get out of 
here.” Later, during closing speeches 
on Library Walk from key players, 
A.S. Campuswide Senator Bryant 
Pena expressed his dismay over such 
disunity within the student body.

But we must remember that not 
every apathetic Price Center rat 
will be inclined to jump from his or 
her seat and join the revolution just 
because there’s a catchy call-back in 
his ear and a Che banner in his face. 
We cannot expect everyone to know 
(or care) about the proposed tuition 
hikes without informing them of the 
basics beforehand. Protestors would 
have been wise to pass out fliers or 

invite students to a future teach-in if 
they expected any sort of progressive 
response from the clueless thousands. 

So, our stance on the walkout: We 
endorse the concept wholeheartedly, 
but encourage a far more informative 
approach. Follow-up walkouts are 
essential — along with the participa-
tion of tax- and tuition-paying par-
ents, who hold the real weapon in the 
eyes of the suits up top. At this point, 
UC leaders probably feel it’s a whole 
lot simpler to rake in more student 
fees than haggle with the federal gov-
ernment or Schwarzenegger’s posse 
for emergency funds. But if protests 
continue to grow in size and we begin 
to chant in unison, we might have a 
real chance to rumble the fault lines.

A DROP FROM THE INKWELL By Priscilla Lázaro

Dear Editor,
Please take a stance in support of 

higher education and the UC walk-
out. Despite just recently graduating, 
these educational price increases are 
still highly important both to me and 
to future generations of California 
students. I am already in enough 
debt from my undergraduate career, 
and tuition hikes would make gradu-
ate school a distant dream for future 
UC students

 It is simply unacceptable that the 
UC administrators are giving them-
selves raises while using the budget 
crisis as an excuse to raise student 
fees.

Moreover, their adoption of 
special emergency powers has shut 
out faculty and students from par-
ticipating in important decisions at 
this crucial hour, and contradicts the 
democratic ethos of the University of 
California.

Again, please take a stance on 
this all-too-important issue. It 
should be the responsibility of the 
student paper to make students 
aware that they are being forced 
out of their education because of 
unaffordable prices. Hopefully, the 
Guardian can join in the protest 
against these outrageous tuition 
hikes and send a clear message to 
the UC Regents that they have no 
support among the student body 
population.

         —Anya Schukin

Dear Editor,
I am an ethnic studies graduate 

of Eleanor Roosevelt College and I 
was active in the UCSD community, 
participating in the Summer Bridge 
Program through Oasis, serving as 
a resident advisor at Sixth College 

for two years, acting as the politi-
cal awareness coordinator for the 
Asian and Pacific Islander Student 
Alliance and co-chairing the Student 
Affirmative Action Committee.

I am writing because I encour-
age you to demonstrate the same 
courage that the editor of the UC 
Berkeley newspaper did in endorsing 
the UC walkout.

Since my freshman year of col-
lege, I have rallied students against 
tuition hikes and cuts in financial 
aid, funding to the libraries and stu-
dent affairs at our campuses. Now, 
the current cuts will adversely affect 
low-income students and students 
of color even further. But these 
changes will also impact the quality 
of instruction and student support 
services of all UC students. We must 
remain united —professors, students, 
staff and alumni — to take a stand 
and defend the best public education 
system in the country. If we don’t, 
the UC Regents and the state of 
California will balance the budget on 
the backs of all of us, impacting our 
futures irreparably.

I support the Guardian and have 
read it regularly.  Respectfully, I ask 
that you take a stand. This is an issue 
that demands the utmost action and 
attention.

grandmother because it’s in their 
job description, right? But truly, 
the fact that the surrogate is raking 
in the cash for helping anyone and 
everyone (perhaps there’s a family 
discount) in a passionless relation-
ship becomes the deal-breaker. 
Because as we’ve been taught, sex 
is a gift that should not ask for 
anything in return. It shouldn’t be 
spoiled in an economic exchange, 
for the act itself is assumed to be 
mutual. 

Why, then, isn’t it taboo when a 
guy buys a cocktail for a girl to get 
her into bed? In so many instances, 
suitors spend a crapload on their 
dates — even if there’s no prospect 
of actual romance in the end — just 
to get some. Maybe these playboys 
aren’t directly exchanging cash for 
sex (that would be too obvious, 
and in society’s gaze, pathetic), but 
they’re not far off. 

It’s moments like these when 
we realize that we, the judgers, are 
not much better than those we’ve 
scorned. Take a moment to imag-
ine how easy it might be to lose 
your footing under the charms a 
deliciously handsome, rich stranger 
— one who so excels at the art of 
seduction that you find yourself 
enticed into bed before even learn-
ing his last name. 

Or what about your favorite 
reality show, “ The Real Whores” — 
I mean “Housewives” — “of Orange 
County”?  In every episode, these 
women prance around in jewels, 
fake boobs and veneers bestowed 
upon them by their pot-bellied 
CEO husbands.

And I’m sure you can guess how 
these Barbies return the favor.  

Sure, superficial exchanges 
occur everywhere, but it’s a little 
easier to reserve our judgment 
when the ladies in question drive 
Range Rovers and wear Dior — 
surely it means they’re doing some-
thing right.

I’m not saying everyone who 
has wriggled off her clothes after 
a delicious steak dinner should 
repent and attempt to re-grow her 
virginity — all I want is for you 
to consider what differentiates the 
Nicholas Sparks epic-romance kind 
of sex from your drunken romp in 
an I-House closet. 

It’s a matter of motives.
If sex surrogates truly want to 

coax Joe Six-pack from feeling less 
like a man every time he goes home 
to his wife, then I think that’s pretty 
noble of them. If it’s all a facade to 
get rich by having sex — genius. 
Though maybe the latter is a little 
less respectable than the former. 

But is she really worse than 
you and your friends, who de-tag 
incriminating drunk photos every 
weekend?

 Contemplate this, boys and girls, 
on your next walk of shame. Or on 
your next lonely Sunday morning, 
with only Taylor Swift and a fistful 
of fries to keep you company.

8 THE UCSD GUARDIAN� MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 2009� OPINION

Dear Editor,
I’m writing as a recent graduate 

and sibling to future UC students. The 
walkouts held at campuses throughout 
the state are an important opportunity 
for students, faculty and staff to send 
a message to both the public and 
the regents that we will not stand by 
while the cost of education skyrockets. 
Nor will we stand to see the funding 
devoted to education dwindle.

Please unequivocally endorse the 
walkout and use the weight of the 
Guardian to show a united student 
front. It will influence the decision-
makers who can help ensure that the 
great UC education so many have had 
the privilege to obtain remains avail-
able to all future students who seek it.

Thank you for all your efforts to 
produce a great campus newspaper 
and best wishes for a great year.

Dear Editor,
I’m writing to urge you and the 

rest of the editorial board of the 
Guardian to stand in solidarity with 
your peers, your faculty members 
and your staff members by endors-
ing the UC-wide walkout on Sept. 
24. UC Berkeley’s paper, The Daily 
Californian, did so in an editorial 
published on Sept. 22, and it’s crucial 
that all members in the UC system 
have an equal opportunity to learn 
about the ways to support each 
other. Needless to say, school papers 
such as the Guardian play a crucial 
role in that educational process. 
Please push for participation in the 
walkout and related events such as 
teach-ins, and please go further than 
the Daily Californian has, and frank-
ly confront the role of the adminis-
tration’s mismanagement of funds 
and power in the current crisis. 
Thank you for your time, and I look 
forward to your public response.

    —Xander Lenc
Junior, UC Berkeley

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
▶ LETTERS, MYVT�WHNL��

John Kline (R-Minnesota) of the 
Education and Labor Committee 
noted that his party’s objection to 
financial-aid reform is not-so-strange-
ly similar to its opposition to health-
care reform. Kline also says he sees no 
reason for this change.

But the truth is that the forward 
step could scarcely be more necessary. 
Students would benefit far more from 
noncorporate government loans than 
the supposedly competitive ones we’ve 
got now. Likewise, those supposed 
“hidden fees,” in all their grand speci-
ficity, amount to little more than an 
oppositional scare tactic.

It’s convenient for politicians who 
aren’t in touch with students’ needs 
to brush them aside, but here’s the 
thing: Students are at their breaking 
point, especially in California. If the 
proposed 32-percent fee increases go 
through next year, many UC students 
will be forced to walk out — not in 
protest, but in resignation. 

The S.A.F.R.A. couldn’t come at 
a better moment. If passed, the bill 
would revitalize the Pell Grant pro-
gram with $40 billion in increased 
funding over the next 10 years, help-
ing to offset the burden of rising 
tuition. It would increase the maxi-
mum award from the current $5,350 
to $5,550 for 2010, and continue to 
grow to $6,900 in 2019. 

The bill would also provide a $10 
billion surge to community colleges, 
recognizing their national importance. 
Community-college funding has tra-
ditionally come from individual states 
— which, to say the least, has proven 
insufficient in California, as enroll-
ment swells and funding shrinks.

A little help from above could go 
a long way in reducing class size and 
increasing enrollment capacity. It’s a 
long time coming: The Guardian, in 
fact, was begging for such reform back 
in May of this year. To see it come to 
fruition now would signify a crucial 
step in the right direction toward 
reforming higher education.

As proposed in the House bill, 
another $8 billion would be directed 
to early-childhood programs, and 
we’d still have $10 billion to give back 
to the Treasury. The change would 
even simplify the Free Application 
for Federal Student Aid — meaning 
you may get to keep your great-great-
grandma’s maiden name to yourself 
after all. 

Cutting out the middleman in 
lending would not only save bil-
lions — it would allow us to put 
those billions to better use, and make 
our degrees a little more affordable. 
Imagine that.

“
OVERHEARD

We’re in a level-two
drought. I didn’t know
water was still free!”

2:34 P.M.
PRICE CENTER

Last month, a group of eight Scripps scientists embarked on a 20-day expedition to capture the Pacific Ocean’s 
most elusive new specimen: garbage.  
The voyage was the first comprehensive 
study of marine debris’ effects on the 
ocean — though the collection of trash 
accumulating in the Pacific isn’t exactly 
novel.

The North Pacific Gyre, a col-
lection of currents which form a 
vortex between South East Asia and 
North America, is estimated to have 
amassed enough coastal waste to 
span Texas two times over, and has 
earned the nickname the Great Pacific 
Garbage Patch. 

Despite its estimated size, the trash 
patch isn’t yet a well-known world 
attraction. Ocean researcher Captain 
Charles Moore stumbled upon it on his 
way back from an offshore yacht race 
in 1997 and published his findings on 
the area. Soon afterward, the Algalita 
Marine Research Foundation began 
integrating this information into its 
educational presentations.

In November 2007, Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography gradu-
ate students Miriam Goldstein, Meg 
Rippy, Darcy Taniguchi , Jesse Powell 
and Alison Cawood attended one such 
seminar detailing Moore’s marine 
debris discoveries.

TAKING CHARGE
After the lecture, the students dis-

cussed the garbage patch over lunch. 
Goldstein took charge, asking the oth-
ers if they’d be interested in researching 
the biological effects of the marine 
debris. 

Each grad had a different area of 
focus that could aid the project — from 
Taniguchi’s knowledge of phytoplank-
ton to Powell’s interest in oceano-

Equipped with sampling nets and their very own research vessel, 
a group of graduate students from the Scripps Institution of

Oceanography boldly went where no oceanographer has gone 
before: to a trash vortex in the middle of the Paciﬁc Ocean.

INFOCUS Welcome Week

7/6;6:�)@�,902�1,7:,5�GUARDIAN

T housands of students crawled out of their new dorms to participate in Welcome Week, UCSD’s annual Week Zero full of 
spirit raisers to kick off the new school year. 
Major events included the Welcome Week 
Dance, UCSD Block Party and Meet the Beach. 

For those of you who slept through it all, 
Marshallites rejoiced when Thurgood Marshall 
College ﬁnally took home the Golden Shoe at 
the Unolympics and put 39 embarrassing years 
of foiled attempts and last-minute upsets in the 
past.

At the First Friday Concert, Keak da Sneak 
showed up late and slated opener Millionaires 
didn’t even bother to stop by — but really, who 
missed them?

Later, Chancellor Marye Anne Fox was 
notably absent from the Welcome Convocation 
and Dinner on Tuesday — touted as the top 
Welcome Week event by the Student Affairs 
Ofﬁce.

Way to leave us hanging, Fox.

Top: Vice Chancellor Penny Rue welcomed the newest batch of admits at Convocation, which featured speeches from Calit2 Director Larry 
Smarr and UCSD alumna Alejandra Sotelo-Solis. Middle: Sixth College students flaunted their circus-themed extravaganza but lost the 
Golden Shoe to Thurgood Marshall College’s bumpin’ jungle-boogie dance sequence. Bottom: Getting low at the UCSD’s annual First 
Friday, Keak Da Sneak graced the audience with his tardy, though inevitably hyphy, performance.

S urrounded by a small assemblage of San Diego Urban Corps students, many of whom were high school dropouts, Alejandra Sotelo-Solis tried to 
make the state-funding topic as simple as possible.

“Has anyone here ever bought a Sprite or a can of 
soda?” she asked the group of uniformed students. 
“Because if you have, then in a roundabout way, 
you’ve helped pay for this university. Your taxes have 
gone to help fund the research and the studies that 
go on here.” 

Sotelo-Solis wasn’t trying to bore them with 
sales-tax facts and figures. Rather, she was trying to 
illustrate that each student plays a role in supporting 
California’s public education.

As it turns out, only four of the 60 Urban Corps 
students had ever set foot on a college campus 
before.

Sotelo-Solis, who grew up in National City 
and graduated from Eleanor Roosevelt College in 

2001, has always acknowledged the importance of 
a community’s public institutions. After all, it was 
within the public UC system that she found her sup-
port system, as she joined Movimiento Estudiantil 
Chicano de Aztlan (M.E.Ch.A.), the Cross-Cultural 
Center and the university softball team. 

Early on, Sotelo-Solis recognized that diversity 
was visibly deficient at UCSD — and that the diver-
sity lauded in admit-day brochures wasn’t exactly 
reality within her own daily experience.

“You take a poli-sci course and talk about how 
important it is to recognize social and economic and 
gender diversity, and yet around campus, you notice 
a lack of representatives,” she said.

A natural-born leader, Sotelo-Solis worked as res-
ident advisor for International House and commu-
nity education coordinator for the annual Hate-Free

graphic equipment — so they agreed 
to write individual parts of a research 
project proposal.

Ultimately, they hoped that 
University of California Ship Funds 
would finance their study, despite 
hear-say that funding for student-led 
expeditions was seldom awarded.

About six months later, in May 
2008, Goldstein learned the proposal 
had been approved.

“I was like, ‘Oh crap!’ We actually 
have to do this,” she said.

THE RACE FOR FUNDING
Then the real work began. 

Goldstein, who was named the proj-
ect’s chief scientist due to her initial 
sense of leadership, needed money 
for what was now to be called the 
Scripps Environmental Accumulation 
of Plastic Expedition. The Ship Fund 
only agreed to pay for 13 of the 20 
proposed days of research at sea — 
not including funds for transportation 
and supplies.

The SEAPLEX vessel would 
leave from San Diego but return to 
Newport Beach, meaning that almost 
everyone would need a ride home. In 
terms of equipment, they lacked basic 
research accessories — including hun-
dreds of glass jars to hold samples.

There was also the minor issue of 
finding someone to lend them about 
$20,000 worth of oceanographic 
equipment.

“We had no money to back the 
equipment,” Goldstein said. “So we 
had to find people who would lend it 
to us knowing that if it was damaged, 
we couldn’t replace it.”

But the contributions rolled 
in. The Scripps Center for Marine 
Biodiversity and Education, the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration South West Marine 
Center and a slew of interested profes-
sors lent the SEAPLEX students the 
gear they needed.

NOAA even recommended 
Goldstein grab a beer at the Newport 
Beach Brewing Company when she 
returned. 

Next came the issue of what to do 
about those last seven days, which 
remained unfunded. The solution 
came when SEAPLEX found its 
perfect match: Project Kaisei, a non-
profit dedicated to raising awareness 
about the Garbage Patch, lobbying 
policymakers to address its existence 
and developing oceanographic waste-
removal equipment.

Kaisei fronted the bill, and a 

couple members even tagged along for 
the ride — including cofounder and 
director Douglas Woodring. 

Ultimately, Woodring’s goals in 
collaborating with Scripps boiled 
down to environmental credibility.

“We have two battles,” Woodring 
said. “In the ocean itself, it’s figur-
ing out how to fix the damage we’ve 
done. On land, there’s another set of 
circumstances for policy to allow this 
to happen. That’s why there’s a big 
compliment with the Scripps scientists 
and Project Kaisei. They’ve got the 
good science to back us up when we 
contact policymakers and say there’s a 
problem.”

The SEAPLEX team had grown 
to 14 members: eight scientists — 
including Scripps professor and 
faculty advisor Jim Leichter — three 
volunteers to aid in data collection, 
three representatives from Project 
Kaisei and two others in charge of 
communication and outreach.

SETTING SAIL
On Aug. 2, the SEAPLEX team 

joined a 12-man crew — composed 
of three able-bodied seamen, four 
engineers, two mates, two cooks and 
a captain — aboard the New Horizon. 
Since no one knew just how much lit-
ter was considered normal to be in the 
water, they headed 12 hours west of 
San Diego to sample water at a refer-
ence point outside the Garbage Patch 
and get a feel for the team’s chemistry. 

After picking up some plastic 
tidbits, they sputtered further west at 
11.5 miles per hour toward the North 
Pacific Gyre.

Though Goldstein chose the 
coordinates of the destination based 
on other reports about the trash 
superhighway’s location, there was no 
guarantee the team would find what 
it was looking for. The Garbage Patch 
isn’t an island anyone can spot from a 
telescope. In fact, the pieces of debris 
at its surface are so small that they are 
hardly visible to the naked eye.

But finally, after four and a half 
days of traveling, they hit the debris 
jackpot: litter in the form of shattered 
plastic, buckets, strainers, buoys, fish-
ing nets, the occasional rope and a 
lone construction worker’s hard hat.

The SEAPLEX team worked 24 
hours a day in 12-hour shifts to maxi-
mize their research time. Members 
collected samples with different tows 
— nets dragged through the ocean for 
the purpose of catching debris — and 
bottled them for the trip back. 

Though most scientists were 

BONGO NET
Named after their loose resemblance to bongo 
drums, these mesh nets are most commonly 
used to sample zooplankton. The net is placed 
inside the water to capture tiny particles, 
which are funneled into a collection receptacle 
called the cod end. Most bongo tows reach 
about 200 meters in depth and are placed in 
the water in a “V” shape in order to sample 
depths more than once. The mouth of each 
net measures the volume of the water filtered 
through the net.

Miles from Civilization, Scripps Scientists Discover an Ecosystem Full of  Waste
▶ GYRE, MYVT�WHNL� 

CTD ROSETTE
The Conductivity, Temperature and 
Depth rosette was a hot commodity 
on the New Horizon. One of the 
most commonly used pieces of 
oceanographic equipment, it helps 
scientists examine water’s vertical 
structure and collects water from 
various depths. It is constructed with 
several sensors — each surrounded 
by bottles — that measure pressure, 
temperature and conductivity, ulitmately aiding scientists to determine 
density. Sometimes the CTDs also have sensors to measure qualities that 
indicate phytoplankton abundance. The bottles open automatically when 
the rosette is put in the water, and are closed at various depths on the 
way up. Scientists use these water samples to observe nutrients, bacteria, 
phytoplankton and protists.

OOZEKI MIDWATER TRAWL
The oozeki trawl is similar to the 
bongo net, but is used to capture 
small fish and is therefore much 
larger (about 6 feet tall). The mesh 
of its net is also wider, allowing 
zooplankton to slip through the 
trawl while capturing larger 
specimen. The trawl reaches as 
deep as 2,000 meters, which 

is how SIO graduate student Pete Davison caught several deep-sea 
creatures during the SEAPLEX expedition, including an anglerfish and 
a vampire fish.

See SEAPLEX, page 14

“It was just very sad tosee [the debris] as
consistently as we did
because nothing in the 
ocean is found that
regularly. But that trash
sure was.

14 THE UCSD GUARDIAN� MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 2009� FOCUS

studying different elements of the 
ecosystem — whether phytoplankton 
or deep-sea fish — the amount of gar-
bage they found in between was hard 
to ignore. Out of 132 surface samples, 
the SEAPLEX team found garbage in 
100 consecutive tows at the eastern 
rim of the Garbage Patch.  

“There was no sign of anyone any-
where for weeks, except that we found 
everyone’s trash out there,” Taniguchi 
said. “We could obviously only see 
really well what was on the surface, so 
who knows what’s below the surface. 
We were really literally and figuratively 
just skimming the surface because we 
only looked at a small area of where it 
could potentially be. It was just very 
sad to see it as consistently as we did, 
because nothing in the ocean is found 
that regularly. But that trash sure was.”

But the trip wasn’t all buoys and 
fishnets. The SEAPLEX team also 
discovered gooseneck barnacles, 
crabs, sponges and anemones that had 
converted the trash into their living 
quarters. 

“Everyone says, ‘They have a place 
to live, so it’s not that bad, right?’” 
Goldstein said. “But not exactly.”

According to Goldstein, the gar-
bage poses a number of threats to sea 
life. Animals that eat the debris may be 
harmed, and garbage to which animals 
attach themselves could potentially 
float into neighboring ecosystems, in 
turn disrupting their balance.

A GLIMMER OF HOPE
Despite the sobering amount 

of waste the SEAPLEX explorers 
encountered, they were still able to 
enjoy the abundant marine life below.

Pete Davison, a fifth-year Scripps 
graduate student, retrieved a vampire 
fish and an anglerfish, which he plans 
on dissecting in search of ingested 
plastic. The team also spotted a dead 
giant squid the size of an adult human 
and hauled it on deck to examine 
the carcass. They kept it’s beak as a

Campus Campaign. In addition, she 
said that while working as a student 
activist for M.E.Ch.A., she began 
to understand the social impact of 
issues she had learned about in her 
classes — issues that she would later 
integrate into her political preroga-
tive.

“Now, as a politician, that’s what 
I’m able to do — apply my educa-
tion to real-life situations in National 
City,” said Sotelo-Solis. “So when 
we’re talking about gentrification 
or communities that are, you know, 
surrounded by vacant lots when 
they should have more single-family 
homes, I’m applying things I origi-
nally learned in the classroom.”

After graduating in 2001, Sotelo-
Solis participated in the Coro 
Fellowship in Los Angeles — mark-
ing the beginning of what would be 
an ascendant political career.

Through her experiences with the 
fellowship, which was designed to 
develop diverse civic leaders, Sotelo-
Solis quickly adapted to life outside 
the UCSD bubble. After completing 
the fellowship, she worked as District 
Director for San Diego Assembly 
Member Lori Saldaña, and later as 
a field representative for Monterey 
Park Assembly Member (and current 
congresswoman) Judy Chu.

In June 2008, Sotelo-Solis ran for 
National City’s city council, and was 
shortly after elected as Vice Mayor 
by fellow councilmembers under a 
campaign that pledged to curb pol-
lution in residential areas and work 
with community organizations to 
help curb neighborhood crime. 

Over the short term that she’s 
been in office, Sotelo-Solis has 
worked with numerous nonprofits 
— such as Healthy Neighborhoods 
and the Environmental health 
Coalition — to re-evaluate the city’s 
planning proposals. Specifically, she 

has fought to zone industrial and 
commercial districts away from resi-
dential housing.

“The last 10 months have been 
exciting, nonstop, hard-working 
months,” said Sotelo-Solis. “But I 
really got to see my community in a 
new light, with new faces.”

With a current population of 
approximately 60,000 residents, 
National City contains an ethnically 
diverse demographic that’s vastly 
disinterested in city-hall affairs.  

“We only have approximately 
15,000 [residents] that are registered 
to vote,” said Sotelo-Solis. “So when 
we’re talking about the electorate, 
it’s about a quarter of the people … 
and I think those who are under-
represented are really wanting to see 
change in city hall.”

Serving as only the third female 
on city council in National City’s his-
tory, Sotelo-Solis said she makes it a 
point to attend as many community 
events as possible in order to reach 
out to local families who may have 
grown up detached from the world 
of politics.

Though she has expanded the 
scope of her public service, she still 
hasn’t loosened her ties to UCSD. 
She has worked as the Director of 
Community Law Project — a pro-
gram for undergraduates interested 
in law, public policy and public 
advocacy — since last July. 

Though recent budget cuts have 
relocated CLP from Student Policies 
and Judicial Affairs to the Center for 
Student Involvement, Sotelo-Solis is 
optimistic about the project’s poten-
tial in the realms of social advocacy.

“I’m definitely looking forward 
to the move and the new family with 
the Center for Student Involvement,” 
said Sotelo-Solis.

Taniguchi, whose primary focus 

was examining microbial communi-
ties within the garbage patch, worked 
from 8 p.m. to noon in order to con-
sistently compare her samples with 
others in the Scripps reserve. On her 

last evening 
of sampling, 
she noticed 
that the waves 
around her 
were glowing. 
The light came 
straight from 
her research 
subjects: bio-
luminescent, 
6-inch pyro-
zome organ-
isms flickering 
in the breaking 
waves.

After a total 
of 20 days on 
the ocean, the 
New Horizon 
delivered the 
SEAPLEX 

team back to Newport Beach, samples 
in hand. 

Now, the Scripps scientists are 
rushing to complete their research 

and publish a report detailing the gar-
bage patch’s effects on the ecosystem. 
Though projects designed to help clear 
the area’s trash are still in beginning 
stages, the team hopes to provide as 
much information as possible to the 
scientific community and activist orga-
nizations that support ocean cleanup.

“If you want to know how to clean 
it up, you need to know where it is, 
how big it is and what sort of material 
it is,” Goldstein said. “We’re providing 
the basic facts.”

Scientists from the SEAPLEX team 
hope to release a report on the Great 
Pacific Garbage Patch by next year, 
and to encourage environmentalists to 
use their findings as a lobbying asset 
with which to influence policymakers. 

“This is about science, not politics,” 
said Jesse Dubler, a 2008 Earl Warren 
College alumnus who volunteered 
on the SEAPLEX team. “We need to 
coordinate among ourselves to estab-
lish this single World Environmental 
Organization as soon as possible, so 
that we’d have the resources to defend 
ourselves from the environmental con-
sequences of actions committed in the 
past few decades.”

Mike Wright, the team’s newcomers became 
the focus of the race: Four freshmen rounded 
out the top five for the Tritons. Tom Hudson 
finished 34th with a time of 27:24, and Matt 
Lenehan was two spots back, placing 36th. 
Taylor Hogshead and Matt Yankowski took 59th 
and 75th, respectively.

The Tritons totaled 204 points to place 
eighth overall against a field that included 
four nationally ranked squads. No. 12 Stonehill 
College had four of the top 10 runners on the 
men’s side, and went on to win the meet. Host 
and No. 9 Southern Indiana took second overall 
in the meet.

The Triton women were without All-
American junior Bre Schofield, who did not 
travel due to illness. Nevertheless, the team 
pulled off a solid performance in her absence, 
with reigning CCAA Freshman of the Year 
Inouye as UCSD’s top individual finisher for 
the first time in her career. Inouye ran the 6K 
course in 23:28 and took 17th place overall. She 
was followed by junior Caprice Thompson and 
senior Marie Schaper, who finished one second 
apart to take 30th and 31st, respectively. The top 
five was rounded out by juniors Brianna Alban 
and Nina Su.

According to the U.S. Track and Field and 

Cross Country Coaches Association, five of 
the competing teams ranked in the top 25. The 
UCSD women’s team’s total score of 148 points 
was good for sixth place overall against the stel-
lar field. 

With all five of its runners in the top 10, 
No. 13 University of Tampa claimed the wom-
en’s title, while host and No. 11 USI placed 
second. 

“As a team, I feel like we raced well,” Garcia 
said. “It can always be somewhat challenging 
to go on the road and travel to a setting where 
we aren’t really familiar. I feel like our group 
handled that really well and I was pleased with 
the results.”

Garcia added that he and his coaching staff 
always choose runners to travel based on who 
is most prepared to represent the university.

“It just happened that this week it was a 
very young group,” Garcia said. “It was a fun 
experience being able to take a younger group 
back to Indiana.”

The Tritons return home to prepare for the 
San Diego Track Club USATF 5K on Saturday, 
Oct. 3. The team will try to use the shorter-
distance competition to help prepare for the 
high-profile Triton Classic the following week.

16 THE UCSD GUARDIAN� MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 2009� SPORTS

But we have to stay positive, take what 
we can from this game and continue 
moving forward.”

Held scoreless throughout the 
first period, UCSD posted neon 
numbers on the board early in the 
second quarter, when a Donohoe 
goal tied the game 1-1. LMU, how-
ever, heated up on offense and netted 
three more goals to close the half 
with a 4-1 lead. 

In a six-on-five opportunity dur-
ing the third quarter, freshman util-
ity Brian Donohoe scored to bring 
UCSD within two points, but supe-
rior ball movement by the Lions left 
the Tritons in a 6-2 hole heading into 
the final period.

With just over six minutes left 
to play, the Lions extended their 
lead to five by taking advantage of 
Triton miscues. Goals by senior Bryce 
Madsen and Brian Donohoe at 5:55 
and 2:34, respectively, cut the Lion 
lead to three goals. The two late-game 
points were all the Tritons would 
manage as LMU held on for a 7-4 
win.

Despite coming up short against 
the Lions offensively, the Tritons 
played solid defense, holding LMU to 
seven goals and stripping the Lions of 
their entry pass during the final min-
utes of the game. 

“Our six-on-five — our extra man 
— was not very efficient tonight,” 
Harper said. “We only made two out 
of six. I can live with a team that plays 
really good defense, but what I can’t 
live with is how we goofed up on some 
of our six-on-fives. We made pass-
ing errors for absolutely no reason. It 
would be the equivalent of just hitting 
a tennis ball into the net, even though 
the shot you just received wasn’t very 
good. We had too much of that, and 
that annoys me.”

As a result of being displaced from 
their home turf at Canyonview Pool, 
the Tritons have been forced to weath-
er discontinuity at practice — a hard-
ship to which players hope to adjust. 
This week, UCSD is preparing to host 
UC Davis on Oct. 2.

“Davis is always a tough team to 
play,” Steven Donohoe said. “They 
usually bring size, speed and strength. 
It’s a typical conference foe — they 
get fired up to play us, and they’re 
going to want to beat us in our pool 
— or, our surrogate pool. We’re going 
to have to match that by focusing. 
We’ve got to get more focused before 
games, come out confident and play 
our game. If we play our game, we’ll 
be good.”

outside hitter Karen Reis said. “We 
just don’t have the same intensity that 
we need early on.”

Despite watching Chico State jump 
to a quick 4-1 lead, UCSD staged a 
comeback and eased through the rest 
of the match, taking a 25-20 victory in 
the first game. The Tritons were able 
to bounce back from an early hole to 
regain the game’s momentum.

“We analyzed tapes of their other 
matches and then we game-plan 
based on what they do, to try to take 
advantage of their mistakes,” senior 
captain outside hitter Sylvia Schmidt 
said. 

The Wildcats, however, were not 
ready to let the Tritons run away with 
an easy win. Despite hitting at a sea-
son-high .361 clip and a burst from 
Schmidt’s game-leading 17 kills, the 
Tritons could not control their serves, 
allowing Chico State to stay close 
throughout the second game. Despite 
leading the CCAA in aces, the Tritons 
allowed the Wildcats to score the 
majority of their second-game points 
with constant hitting errors, dropping 
the game 25-22.

“We probably gave them about 
90 percent of their points with our 
missed serves in the second game,” 
Black said.

The Tritons stormed out of half-
time with renewed energy and picked 
up a quick lead in the third game. 
Senior setter Elaine Chen paced 

the offense with solid setting as the 
Tritons put their second-game lapses 
behind them. They took control with 
game-changing kills and accurate 
blocking to win 25-14.

“There were no magic words that 
fixed everything,” Black said about 
his team’s post-halftime play. “We just 
looked at how we were playing and 
knew that we couldn’t give them so 
many points. We just focused more 
and tried not to make the same mis-
takes.”

UCSD maintained its new inten-
sity for the remainder of the match 
and withstood a late-game Wildcat 
charge to finish off Chico State with 
a 25-20 win. Playing a nationally 
ranked opponent for the first time 
in nearly three weeks, the four-game 
victory gave UCSD a boost that will 
help sustain a push toward the CCAA 
championships.

“It felt great to win against Chico 
State,” Black said. “When your oppo-
nent makes mistakes and you capital-
ize, it almost feels like you can’t make 
any mistakes and everything goes 
right.”

On the heels of its gritty victory 
against Chico State, UCSD hosted Cal 
State Stanislaus on Sept. 26. After the 
previous night’s hard-fought game, 
the Tritons knew they would have to 
keep their play in check against the 
Warriors.

“We didn’t have any emotional let-
down,” Schmidt said. “We try to treat 

every opponent the same every night.”
As they had already done seven 

times this season, the Tritons beat 
their opponent in three straight games 
— this time, defeating the Warriors 
25-14, 25-16, 25-20.

Although UCSD won all three 
games against Stanislaus, the victo-
ries again came after overcoming a 
slow start.

“We were a little worried there for 
a bit,” Black said. “But we refocused 
ourselves and came back in the game.” 

The Tritons stormed back on the 
shoulders of an offense that hit at 
a season-best .356 clip and saw ten 
players record kills. The win raised 
UCSD’s season record to 14-1 (6-1 
CCAA), while the Warriors dropped 
to 6-8 overall with an 0-6 in-confer-
ence mark. The weekend wins held 
extra meaning for  Black, UCSD’s 
fifth-year coach. 

“It always feels great to get a win, 
but even more since it was Black’s 
100th win,” Reis said after the match. 

The Tritons look to use their 
momentum in another back-to-
back home series next weekend. 
They will face Cal State Monterey 
Bay on Oct. 2 and San Francisco 
State on Oct. 3 before hitting the 
road for Northern California, where 
they will play Humboldt State on 
Oct. 9 and Sonoma State on Oct. 10.

chance you got, which made me lose 
my temper with you a handful of 
times. Which, of course, caused the 
whole world to think I’m a huge dick 
— an added bonus.

Mark Fainaru-Wada and Lance 
Williams made sure everyone knew 
that my genitals weren’t quite that big. 
So a big thanks go out to you two — 
the sneaky San Francisco Chronicle 
investigative reporters who used their 
hobby of digging through dumpsters 
to spy on my ass. You exposed the 
dirty details of my so-called steroid 
scandal, transforming me from a 
bigheaded star to a despicable human 
being.

Thank you Jeff Kent, for driv-
ing in just enough runs in 2000 to 
steal my MVP award. Before people 
thought I was a cheater, they thought 
I was a bad team player because of 
you. Luckily, no one noticed that I 
was the one getting on base, allowing 
you to rack up all those RBIs. Good 
thing they didn’t realize I didn’t get 
in any of my teammates’ faces before 

you showed up in San Francisco. You 
were the one who fired up a general 
dislike toward me among the public, 
without which I would 
never have broken any 
records.

A big “thank you” 
goes out to Peter 
Magowan and Brian 
Sabean for keeping the 
steroid use under wraps 
when you clearly knew 
exactly what was going 
on. You can’t put a price 
on packed stadiums, 
merch sales and licensing 
agreements. Looks like 
you made enough money 
off me to fuel your gar-
lic-fry addiction.

Lastly, I want to 
thank you, Bud Selig, 
for making me the No. 1 scapegoat 
in all of Major League Baseball. You 
knew that all your players were using, 
but you decided to do nothing about 
it. Instead, you opted to attack and 
blame me for all the problems in the 

sport so that you wouldn’t go down 
as the worst commissioner of all time. 
So I went ahead and broke Hank 

Aaron’s record while I 
was clean, just to spite 
you. 

Thank you Bud Selig, 
for providing me with 
the motivation I needed 
to become the all-time 
home-run leader. Too 
bad I couldn’t return the 
favor, Bud. I really tried 
to keep you from going 
down as baseball’s most 
infamous commissioner, 
but unfortunately, word 
got out that I wasn’t the 
only athlete playing the 
game juiced. What a 
shocker! 

Anyway, on this 
historic day, I want to truly express 
my gratitude to all those people who 
made me baseball’s most despised 
athlete. Because of you, I became 
baseball’s greatest. Suck on that, 
bastards.

VOLLEYBALL — Despite the added pressure of fall 
classes starting up, the UCSD women’s volleyball players 
did not let up the dominating performances that has char-
acterized their play throughout the young season. Playing 
against Chico State University and Cal State Stanislaus on 
Sept. 25 and 26, respectively, the Tritons cruised to two 
strong victories. The wins propelled the No. 4 Tritons 
to second place in the California Collegiate Athletic 
Association, with Saturday’s win marking career victory 
No. 100 for head coach Tom Black. 

The Tritons opened their weekend series against the 
Chico State Wildcats, who entered the game ranked No. 23 
in the nation with a 12-2 record. UCSD started slow with an 
unusual number of mistakes, allowing Chico State to stay in 
the game early on. 

“We started off slow, and we’re really working to improve 
our starting pace,” Black said. “We just need to increase our 
intensity in warm ups to find a pace.” 

Slow starts have become a pattern for the Tritons, who — 
in order to play deep into this season’s playoffs — will need 
to start their matches with as much enthusiasm as they have 
displayed late in games.

“It’s not that we try to start off our games slow,” senior 

Classy or 
Not, the 
Truth is
Refreshing
Michael Jordan’s “classless” speech after his induction into the Hall of Fame was 
all the rage this summer, with every-
one from professional sportswriters 
to amateur bloggers ripping MJ to 
pieces. Being without television for 
the past few months — liberating 
and frustrating at the same time — I 

missed His Airness’ speech when it 
was delivered. After hearing all the 
controversy surrounding it, I was 
looking forward to finally sitting 
down and YouTube-ing the 20-min-
ute acceptance address.

First of all, I have to admit to 
being a huge Michael Jordan fan. 
One of my biggest dreams for as 
long as I could remember was to 
meet Jordan in person. (If that day 
ever comes, I will no doubt start cry-
ing like a baby.) 

Despite my love for Jordan, I 
was looking forward to hearing this 
total lack of class from my child-
hood hero, something sports media 
giants were hyping up like nobody’s 
business. But midway through the 
speech, I was still waiting for the 
controversy. By the end of it, I was 
left wondering whether I had missed 
something.

So, in light of my disappoint-
ment, I have decided to travel into 
the future and visit the 2013 Major 
League Baseball Hall of Fame 
Induction in an attempt to present to 
all the sportswriters out there what 
a truly classless speech sounds like. 
Just like Jordan, this possible future 
inductee is someone I grew up idol-
izing on the baseball field. And just 
like Jordan’s address, the speech is 
truthful — even if it isn’t as classy as 
John Stockton’s.

You’ve now been transported to 
2013. The economy has been fixed, 
we’ve solved global warming by jack-
ing resources from Jupiter and you’re 
sitting in Cooperstown for the Hall 
of Fame Induction.

Bud Selig: I guess it’s time for 
me to introduce our next inductee: 
(cries a little inside) Barry Bonds.

Barry Bonds: Oh man, this is 
such an honor. You know, I never 
could have gotten here without the 
help of several people, and I’d like to 
take this opportunity to thank them.

Ayo, how’s it going Pedro? (Points 
to Pedro Gomez of EPSN). You’re the 
first person I want to thank tonight. 
This fool was on my ass 24/7 during 
my chase for the home-run record, 
and I appreciate the persistence with 
which you followed my game. You 
truly are my most dedicated fan. You 
also annoyed the shit out of me every

CROSS COUNTRY — Traveling 
without several of its top upperclass-
men, the UCSD cross-country team 
looked to a pair of sophomores to 
lead the way.

Sophomores Jeremy Riley and 
Elena Inouye led the men’s and wom-
en’s teams as the Tritons ran strong at 
the University of Southern Indiana 
Pre-National Invitational on Sept. 
26. Embarking on their longest trip 
yet this season, the meet allowed 
UCSD to preview the course that 
will be site to the NCAA Division 
II Cross Country Championships in 
late November. 

“Elena Inouye and Jeremy Riley, 
as sophomores, did a really nice job 
leading our team,” head coach Nate 
Garcia said. “They put themselves 
in a position where they showed 
that they weren’t in any way intimi-
dated by the high-caliber athletes 
that were out there.”

Riley completed the 8K course in 
26:52 to finish 24th overall. Running

MEN’S WATER POLO — The No. 
13 men’s water polo team suffered 
a disappointing 7-4 loss against bit-
ter rival Loyola Marymount on Sept. 
24 at the Coggan Family Aquatic 
Center.  The loss dropped the Tritons’ 
record to 5-7, while the fifth-ranked 
Lions improved their record to 8-2. 
Urged on by a large, enthusiastic 
home crowd, the Tritons played well 

defensively, but were plagued by a 
struggling offense and a few pivotal 
mistakes that ultimately cost them 
the game.  

“In the fourth quarter particularly, 
we missed some real strong opportu-
nities in front of the cage, and we just 
didn’t shoot well,” head coach Denny 
Harper said.

A core challenge facing the team 
this season will be training somewhat 
inexperienced players to can step up 
as shooters, as two of the Tritons’ 

leading goal scorers from last season 
graduated last spring.

“We just made a lot of dumb mis-
takes,” senior two-meter defender 
Steven Donohoe said. “One of our 
biggest problems right now is inex-
perience — and that’s actually what 
[Coach Harper] is saying. We’re going 
to play our best ball towards the end 
of the season. I’m the only returning 
starter field player, and that’s tough.

Senior driver Sean Roberts looks for an open pass against Loyola Marymount University on Sept. 24. The Tritons, playing on the first day of the Fall 
Quarter, struggled offensively and could not overcome an early 4-1 deficit, eventually losing the match 7-4 — their eighth straight loss to the Lions.
