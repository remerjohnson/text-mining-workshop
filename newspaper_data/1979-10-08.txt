Cultural Unity· Day Speakers 
Urge Activism by Minorities 
Music, Dance, Food, Artwork Celebrate Diversity 

By John Hondros 
Associate News Editor 
Although the festive 

atmosphere of the second 
annual Cultural Unity Day of 
Awareness could have been 
taken lightheartedly, the tone 
of the speeches demanded 
tha.t they be taken seriously. 

CUDA, organized by the 
Asian American Student 
Alliance, Black Student 
Union , Movimiento Estudi· 
antil Chicano de Aztlan and 
Native American Student 
Alliance, featured musicians 
and dancers from around the 
world and multicultural foods I 
and artworks last Friday. 

majority, " . continued Baca, 
"you students must stop and 
question what our role is and 
what it will be. We must work 
to equate our number with 
power." 

Baca warned that unless the 
Chicano community "wakes 
up to the day to day genocide 
against the border people, we 
will find ourselves in the same 
situation as the Jews in Nazi 
Germany." 

As co·founder of the 
American Indian movement, 
Dennis Banks spoke of the 
need for Native Americans to 
hold on to their culture. 

"I'm not advocating 
segregation," Banks said, 
"just a separate school system. 
We need to sing our own lOng, 
dance our own dance and 
practice our own religion. 
When we begin to abandon 
our spiritual habits, we 
abandon who we are." 

Activist Shirley Weber, 
who is the chairwoman of 
Black Studies at SDSU, 
claimed blacks have "suffered 
serious reversals in the 70s." 

Calling the 60. a decade of 
black consciousness, Weber 
argued that the "recession" of 
the 70s has led to a "Black 
Depression. ,. 

Dennis Banks, Native American activist of Wounded Knee, 
spoke to a Cultural Unity Day Awareness audience last Friday. 
He addressed the need for Native Americans to hold on to their 
culture. 

But the political and social 
status of minority groups in 
America was the subject of 
speeches by four activists: 
Herman Baca, Dennis Banks, 
Shirley Weber and Philip Vera 
Cruz. 

" In 1979, we find ourselves 
in conflict everywhere we turn 
- bending to the ways of 
White society, confronting our 
own values . We don't practice 
the ways of our people when 
altendin~ the university. 

She criticized black students 
for "wanting to be part of the 
mainstream that will never 
accept us. If we can't represent 
our own people, we might as 
well be dead. IntraD1u~al Funding

UCSD' 'Visitors to South African University 
Present Details of Affirll1ative Action Plans 

... more photo. p.4 

By Steve Schneider 
. Three UCSD administrators spent over 

three weeks in South Africa last July 
presenting Affirmative Action 
information to South African Universities. 

In what former Assistant chanf:ellor 
David Ryer terms a " modestly 
successful" trip, EOP Director William 
Byrd and OASIS Director Ken Majer 
spent 25 ~ays in South Africa with Ryer , 
addressing the problem of desegregation 
of South African universities. 

But because the US International 
Communication Agency has established 
affirmative action as one of its "top 
priorities, " the three may revisit South 
Africa next summer to provide ' further 
information, Majer said. 

The UCSD offi(.;als were invited to 
South Africa by the ICA at the request of 
Witswaterllrand University in 
Johannesburg, known as Wits. 

Wit is one of two white universities in 
South Africa that will "allegedly" admit 
increasing number of blacks beginning 
this January, according to Ryt"r. 

To assist in the further desegregation 01 
the universities, the US Embassy and 
Wits sponsored a three·day seminar at 
Wits, where Ryer. Byrd and Majer met 
with representatives from 13 of the 16 
South African universities . 

During th e mee ting th e three 
Americans presented information on 
OASIS and EOP programs at UCSD. 
The remainder of the trip was mostly 
spent in a similar manner, as the three 
travelled to various universities giving 
·'mini·talks," Majer says. 

For their efforts, Ryer , Byrd and Majer 
were paid on a daily basis by the US 
government. Transportation and lodging 
in South Africa were provided by the 
ICA. 

The visitors say they were well· 
received by their hosts . The fact that Byrd 
is black caused no problems, he said. 

Both Majer and Byrd say many South 
African universities and univer ity 
officials are ('ommilted to racial equality. 

Majer also says ther~ are small 
indications of lilwralism in tilt- White 

Afrikaaner government. sh,own by the 
recent establishment of black labor 
unions. 

The current racial segregation of the 
South African universities is maintained 
by a law passed in 1956 prohibiting th 
admission of non ·whites to white 
universities. Wit~ th passing of this law 
came the establishment of universities 

. reserved exclusively for either black, 
Indian or colored (mixed descent) 
siudents. 

According to Ryer, these universitie ' 
are "very inferior" in all respects to the 
white universities.

We Apologize 
A combination of negligence on the part of The Daily 

Guardican'. editon and a lack 01 communication between

apologies to the UCSD community are in order. 

OccuiOnaUy we contract with an advertiser who wanta 
to place an inJert - Ulually a po.ter or Oyer -in the paper 
after it i. printed. We get about $250 for providing the 
aervic:e. Laat week, we ICheduied an insert for Do. [qui., a 
company that i. plugging ita new IiBht beer. It was sent 
direc:dy to our printer in North County and WAi distributed 
with Wednelday'. paper. 

None of the editors .. w the insert. Someone should have, 
bec:aUle it dePlc:ta two women (naked, it appear., until you 
unfold the inaert), posing haunch to haunch. It i. designed 
to parlay the .horta-and·.katea motif that is 10 popular with 
faahion advertiaer. and album deaigner. into big profit. for 
the beer company. It i. sexist in the most elemental and 
vulgar aenae 01 the term. If anyone on the executive board, 
which makes advertiaing policy, had leen it beforehand, it 
never would have run. 

lnat, unfortunately, i. not the whole .tory. Only a 
fraction 01 the inserta ran Wednesday. The re.t ran Friday 
- along with a letter from two readers who, justifiably, 
were outraged by the ad. When we ran the reat 01 the inserts 
the same day, we appeared to ridicule the two women who 
wrote. 

lronicalfy, we were in total agreement with them. We ran 
the reat of the inlerta becaute we were under a legal 
mntracl to do 10, but we did not intend to run them the 
aame day AI the letter. So our fjrat apology i. to those two. 
ruden. 

0... aecond apology i.1o the community as a whole. We 
decided a few yeara ago that our advertising policy would 
be baaed on the editor.' judgement about whether an ad 
WAi potentially offenaive to a significant portion of the 
cornrmmity. But in the Do. [quis caae, we were sloppy; we 
didn't make a point of .eeing the ad beforehand. We let the 
m.ditional division between the day.to-day operation. of 
the blllineu and editorial halvea of the paper get in the. way 
01 our raponaibiIities. 

11uat won't happen again. No ad or insert will appear in 
the paper without being reviewed by a member of the staff. 
We will continue to make judgementa about ad. on two 
levela: whether we find the advertising offenlive, and 
.he .... we think a significant number of our reader. will 
find it oIfenaive. 

Our judaementa wiD always be IUbjective, beeaute we 
have never been able to find a uteful set of ab.olute 
guidelines to follow. But we are lUre last week'. fialCo will

Facts Said Not Straight "In Pub CriticisDlS 
Editor: 

I would like to correct lOme 
misconception. Guardian 
columnilt John Taylor hal 
concerning Walk'. Place 
(" AS: Buying Vote. with 
Beer," Oct. 1). 

The pub contractor, not the 
ASUCSD, . sponlOred ·the 
reception on Wedneaday. The 
pub contractor hAl invited 
campus leaders to his 
establishment to thank them 
for their IUpport, to outline 
what Walk'. Place has 10 
offer, . and to explain how 
organization. and groups may 
ute the facility. The ASUCSD 

. did not Ute any AS money for 
the reception. 

My major objection to 
Taylor's column i. ita liming. 
Walk's Place reflects 18 
monthl of planning, inch.tcling 
student IUrveYI, committee 
hearings and a open bidding 
proceal by the Student Center 

Board, all during which the 
Guardian ran news stories 
updating the progress of the 
Pub. Taylor had 18 months in 
which to Rive his critici.ms, 
critici.m. which would then 
have been .eriously 
con.idered by the board. I, as 
chair of the Pub committee, 
received no .uch critici.m. 
from Taylor. As such, I find 
his· after·the-fact opinion 

. unprofe.sional and an attempt 
at "muckraking." 

Taylor explain. how the AS 
run. the Pub to "buy votes 
with beer," while the fact is 
that the Student Center Board, 
not the undergraduate student 
government (ASUCSD), 
contracts and runs the Pub. 
'The Student Center Board; 
charged with setting Student 
Center policy and allocating 
Student Center fees, conaim 
of one repreaentative from 
each of the four college., one 

graduate repre.entative, an 
undergraduate repreaentative 
and a chair elected by the 
previous year's board. My 
point i. that the Student Center 
board i. not the ASUCSD. 

Taylor .tates that the 
ASUCSD is "in the gravy" 
with all this expected pub 
profit. I reiterate my point 
above: Walk'. Place is 
operated by the Student 
Center Board, not the 
ASUCSD. An important 
delineation, because the 
Student Center Board 
allocates its monies only on the ' 
Student Center facility. As 
such, any Pub profit shall be 
used to off.et inflationary 
increases in .taff, maintenance 
and utility costs to hold down 
atudent fees for the Student 
Center. 

No atudent money was used 
to build Walk'. Place. Henry 
Goldy and Walk Sellick. the 

Pub contractors, spent 
approximately $50,000 W 
open the Pub. . 

Walk's Place opened 
officially Ia.t Friday. The first 
week the manager experi· 
mented with various ID 
checking policies and trained 
new staff. I'd hope The Daily 
Guardian under.ta~. that 

this pa.t week was set aside to

While Men Lose 

WODlen-Runners Ace Tri-Meet 
By Barbara Haal 

The women runners from 
UCSI) left their male 
counterparts behind Saturday, 
finishing first in a tri·meet 
against Whittier and Cal Tech 
while the men's team finished 
last. 

Three UCSD ' women 
finished among the top six, our 
of a field of 14 athletes. But 
none could close in on a swift 
opponent from Cal Tech , who 
sliced almost two minutes off 
the previous record for the 
three mile route with her time 
of 19:30. Pally Farrell of the 
Tritons finished next , in 

second place. Kelly Garedes, 
in fourth place, and Bridget 
Duchame, in sixth, added 
enough depth to give UCSD 
the win. 

The women's leam showed 
surprising strength at the 
contest, and coach Andy Skief 
was impressed . He even 

' speculated about the 
possibility of sending a runner 
to the NAIA District Regional 
meet. "The next meets 
(against Cal Lutheran and the 
schools at the UCLA 
Invitational) are going to be 
crucial in deciding that," he 
said.

He even speculated about the possibility of sending 
a runner to the NAIA District Regional meet. "The 
next meets (against Cal Lutheran and the $Chools at 
the UCLA Invitational) are going to be crucial in 
deciding that," he said. . 

The tri·meet was the first competition of any kind 
this season for the women runners, who have just 
begun their second year as a team. The more 
established men's team, however, couldn't finish 10 
well. 

Hot, smoggy weather, and the con~inuous ups 
and downs of the Whittier course did in the male 
runners that day , "The hilly terrain took a lot out of 
the athletes, and had some bad effects on our guys 
especially ," said Skief after the race. 

Until the midpoint of the run, the best UCSD 
athletes were hanging in with the pack. But the 
weather and the hills wore down the Tritons as the 
race proceeded, and they dropped behind the 
stronger Cal Tech runners. 

CIT shut out the other schools from the first five 
positions, winning easily. Mike Rudman of UCSD 
finished the course in eighth place. 

Despite the poor showing, Skief seemed 
undaunted. The purpose of the first meets, he says, 
is to let runners adjust to the competition, and settle 
into the sport. 

Mid·season is the. time when his runners sh!>lJ1d 
- start placing highly in meets, when opportunities to 

110 to the district regionals are on the line.

Equestrians Meet at La Jolla Fanlls 
By Pat Knowlton 

The La Jolla Farms Horse 
stables and jumping grounds 
put on a 300- horse 
extravaganza over the last 
four days, highlighted by a 
$5000 Grand Prix jumping 
contest. 

Ken Nordstrom finished 
three flawless rounds of 
competition over 15 four·to· 
five·foot jumps with four·to · 
five·foot spreads to win the 
competition . 

The course drew compli. 
ments from Anne Kursinski , 
who won a silver and a bronze 
medal competing for the 
United States in the last World 
Cup competitions. 

"The jumps were big, but 
definitely jumpable," she said. 
"The course designer did a 
really good job." 

Robin Keller, wife of stable 
owner Richard Keller, sees the 
farm as a top facility for the 
sport. " It has the potential to 
be the best on the West Coast, 
next to Spruce Gardens," she 
said. 

Yet its 

be realized if University of 
California plans for the land 
the farm sits on become 
reality. The universitYr which 
owns the property adjacent to 
Torrey Pines Road , where La 
Jolla Farms sits, wants to sell 
the land to housing and 
commercial developers. 

Stable owners maintain that 
the land isn 't even sui table for 
development. "There have 
been big builders who have 
come in who wouldn't touch 
this land with a 10·foot pole," 
said Ms. Keller, who says the 
property is hard to build on 
because a river once passed 
through the area. 

The university has been 
, pressured by the state 

legislature to dispose of the 
land to get it off tax'exempt 
status and back onto the state 
property tax rolls. 

Naturally, horse afici -
onados at the competition 
don't want to see the grounds 
turned into condominiums or 
offices. "The question is big 
money or community 
interest," said Richard Keller. 

"Why would they want to 
take it down?" asked Mickey 
Haden , a trainer from Orange 
County. " It has the nicest 
grounds in all of Southern 
California . Their outside 
course is their best feature, and 
with the Grand Prix, it will 
attract people from all around 
the nation." 

" La Jolla is a marvelous 
faci lity. It is exactly like the 
ones on the East Coast," said 
Ms. Kursinski. 

Yet even though the threat 
of a sale hangs over the 
Kellers. they ha ve big plans for 
the stables. More shows may 
be on the way. " It is not justa 
possibility, but an actuali'ty 
that we will have big 
international competition 
here." said Mrs. Keller . 

A polo field is being built on 
the land also, with plans that 
UCSD students could use the 
new facility. "UCSD used to 
have a polo teams, but they 
had to travel so far to practice 
that the team finally had to 
dissolve," said Keller. "With a 
polo team field right next to 

campus, a team could be 
started again." 

New rings and outside 
courses are being installed. 
and more stables will soon be 
built. A new Grand Prix 
co urse will also be 
constructed, to put the facility 
"on the Olympics level," 
according to Lucy Corsini, an 
employee at the farm. 

The farm puts on abaout 10 
shows during the year, and lets 
the American Kennel 
Association hold dog shows 
also. It .is firmly rooted in the 
community by opening up 
riding classes to the public. 
and through University 
Extension. Senior citizens and 
handicapped people have 
special courses. suited for 
them. 

La Jolla Farms billed the 
weekend competition as 
perhaps the last time for 
UCSD students ·to see top 
competition at the Farm. The 
stables do seem out of place 
among million-dollar homes. 
and their fate is in the hands of 
university planners right now.

Feet are human, too. And therefore have 
an inalienable right to a pair of good, comfortable shoes. 
Like the one you see below. 

It's a Rockport. And it knows how to treat men's 
and women's feet with respect. 

Take the inside for example. With most shoes, the 
inside is just the other side of the outside. We consider that 
callous treatment. And so do feet. 

So we put a foam cushion insole inside. And a full 
leather lining. One that's been specially tanned to make 
it soft and comfy. 

Some companies think we're foolish to work so hard 
on part of a shoe never pay much attention to. 

Frankly, we don't care . 
what they think. We only 

care' how your feet 
feel about it.

Local interviews 
for software professionals 
The purpose of every Wang product is the same: 
to enhance p"-oducti,,ify' 

At Wang Laboratories, we make computer and word processing systems. 
But we'.re really not in the computer or word processing bus1ness. 

Our business is productivity. And that's a people business. 

Because it's people who produce. Machines just make it easier. 
Maybe all this sounds obvious. But you'd be surprised how many com-
puter and word processing manufacturers forget that the end users of 
their products are people. 

At Wang, we never ·forget. 

. That's why our products are simpler to use than theirs. And more 
efficient. 

And that's why we're growing faster than anybody else in the business. 

And that's w~y we're interested in Bachelor's, Master's or PhD 
candidates. . 

2 • I • C I 
Located in Lowell, Massachusetts, we offer excellent salaries and 
benefits including full relocation, profit sharing, stock purchase plan, 
medical and dental insurance, and full tuition reimbursement. 

In addition, we offer all the assets of New England - beautiful beaches, 
mountains, and forests; the historic, cultural, and educational richness 
of the Greater Boston area; and perhaps most important, an enviable 
standard of living within the reach of the software professional. 

Wang's representatives wil·1 be interviewing in the San Diego area on 
Oct. 18. To arrange an interview, call Elaine Rosenberg, Professional 
Recruiter, collect at 1-(617)-459-3786. Or send her your resume as 'soon as 
possible at:
