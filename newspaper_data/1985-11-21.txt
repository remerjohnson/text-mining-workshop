the North Conference Room 

Discussion of anorexia , 
bulimia and compulsive eating 
will be led by a health worker 
from the Raider Institute, a 
private hospital that treats eating 
disorders. 

The workshop is deliberately 
scheduled to precede the 
Thanksgiving holiday, when 
disorder sufferers are surrounded 
by food and subjected to family 
pressures, said WRC staffer Pam 
Orozco. 

The comet is coming: 
AS lecture series 

Halley's Comet and how best 
to view it are the topics of a 
lecture this afternoon at 4 pm to 
the orth Conference Room . 

Research phYSicist Harry 
Houpls will discuss some of the 
myths and facts associated with 
Halley's and other comets. 

Houpls ' presentation IS part of 
a lecture series sponsored by the 
Student Lobby Annex and the AS 
External AffaIrS Board . 

The senes' purpose IS to 
"edu ate students on academiC, 
politi cal and SOCial Issues," and 
the lectures are planned to 
cotoclde with current events, 
according to planner DaVid 
Marchlck. 

"We want to get students 
knowledgeable on Issues and 
hopefully they'll care more ," 
Marchlck said . 

On Tuesday, November 26 , Dr. 
Allen Greb , associate director of 
the Institute on Global Con flict 

BLOOM COUNTY 

and Cooperation, will speak on 
"Sta r Wars" and Arms COntrol. 

Next quarter, the planners 
hope to survey approximately 
1000 students with the purpose 
of understanding what sort of 
lectures would interest students, 
Marchick said. 

Walking on site at 
Scripps 

Another tour of the site for the 
new Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography aquarium will take 
place this Friday, November 22. 

The additional tours were 
scheduled because of high 
attendance at earlier walks. 

The site walks, led by Scripps' 
associate director George Shor, 
are free and open to the public. 
Visitors will be brought up to the 
site in vans. 

All toterested parties should 
meet at the southeast comer of 
the Deep Sea Drilling parking lot. 
Barring rain, the tOur begins at 
noon. For more mformatlon , call 
452-2835 . 

ASIO keeps 
CIA internships 

A resolution to ban the AS 
Internship Office from 
advertising CIA Internships was 
rejected by the AS Council at last 
night'S meeting. 

The resolution. submitted by 
AS President Mary Rose 
Alexander, called the Internship 
"Indirect support for CIA 
recruitment" and hence 
unconscionable. 

AS Councilmembers Peter Kim 
and Greg MacCrone said the 
resolutlon constituted 
"censorship" and vtolated 
students' rights to whatever 

internships interest them. 
The resolution, if passed , 

would not prevent ASIO from 
arranging CIA internships for 
students who speci fically 
requested them. 

The resolution failed 19-1. The 
supporting councilmember was 
University Center Commissioner 
Robert Lewis.

Meet the Regents 
By KAREN L. ROSE 

T HE NOVEMBER meeting of the University Board of Regents, the last of the 
1985 calendar year, took place 
November 14 and 15 at UCLA. 
The Regents heard reports and 
made decisions on several 
important issues: 

A report on afftrmative action 
indicated statistical progress in 
the UC efforts to attract more 
minorities to the system. In the 
fall of 1984, 14 percent of UC 
undergraduates were 
underrepresented minorities 
(excluding Asians), constituting 
an increase of over 11 percent in 
198) and a 39 percent increase 
over 1980. Gains of the past year 
are even more apparent, with an 
underrepresented minority of 
freshmen making up 18 percent 
of fall 1984, up 21 percent from 
1983 and 74 percent from 1980. 
According to preliminary 
registration figures , four of the 
UC campuses (UCB, UCl, UCLA 
and UCR) will have freshman 
classes consisting of 45 to 50 
percent minority students 
(including Asians); the nU'mber 
of graduating minorities will 
increase as well. It was noted 
that this progress was 
accomplished through university 
programs. 

A seismic safety update 
informed the Regents that both 
s'tate and non-state funded 
buildings are in need of seismic 
correction , according to seismic 
safety update. UC vice president, 
William Baker, said 56 university 
buildings in need of repair 
would require $300 million to 
correct seismic safety 
defiCiencies. To correct all state 
buildings would cost an 
estimated ·$2-3 billion, Baker 
said. 

AIDS diagnosis and treatment 
research in the UC system was 
outlined. So far, $10.7 million 
has been spent on research, and 
another $2.3 million will be 
allocated next month for clinical 
drug testing that pote ntially will 
be used to treat AlDS victims. 

The Regents voted in favor of 
a 6,6 percent faculty salary 
increase as part of their 1986-87 
budget. The University'S budget 
will be reviewed and revised by 
Governor Deukmejian before 
going an to the state legislature 
for final approval. The salary

increase would amount to an 
additional $43 million beyond 
what is currently being spent on 
faculty. 

The UC committee on Investor 
Responsibility (UACIR) 
instructed the uC treasurer to 
freeze stock purchases in Nalco 
Chemical Company, one of the 
companies in South Africa in 
which the university has 
invested. Na1co received an 
unsatisfactory rating in its 
compliance with the Sullivan 
Principles, a code of conduct 
voluntarily followed by 
companies in SQuth Africa. 
Although Nalco received a 
satisfactory rating as one of the 
original Signatories of the 
Sullivan Principles in 1977, in 
each of the last five years it was 
stated that Nalco "needs to 
become more active" in adhering 
to the Sullivan PrinCiples and in 
adopting a similar code of 
conduct in promoting Blacks in 
South Africa. The University of 
Califomia will not purchase more 
stock in Na1co, valued at $37 
million as of April 30, until 
UACIR evaluates the next 
reporting cycle of Nalco's 
pcrfonnance to end in fall of 
1986. 

The Cahfornia State 
University'S controversial 
proposal to offer doctoral degrees 
in education was a major area of 
discussion . President Gardner 
called this proposal "a radical 
departure from California State 
University's assigned role in the 
master plan" of the California 
educational system. The 
California Master Plan for Higher 
Education estabhshes the 
California State system as the 
administrater of undergraduate 
degrees in the University of 
California for master and 
doctorate degrees , in addition to 
undergraduate studies. If there is 
a clearly demonstrated and 
unmet need for doctoral training 
in education beyond what is 
currently available, the plan 
should be modified in that 
respect, Baker sa id. His staff is 
currently reviewmg the master 
plan . The CSU issue, which was 
not on the agenda for the 
Regents meeting, received more 
attention from the press than 
any other topiC.

New SIO Aquarium: 
hopes, controversy 
By MELISSA WEINSTEIN. Staff Wnter 

T HE SCRIPPS Institution of Oceanography has begun to plan a new aquarium 
which will replace the old 
Scri pps aquarium museum. 

The new aquarium would be 
31,000 square feet, compared to 
the 12,000 square-foot "old" 
aquarium. The tanks will be 
placed on the bottom level to 
prevent falling concrete. Plans 
include two 30,000 gallon tanks 
plus othe r smaller ones, 
specializing in upper and Baja 
California sea life. 

The "non-profit, educational 
services" provided through 
Scripps are gradually crumbling 
due to the aquarium's current 
status, according to 510 associate 
director, George Shor. "The 
building has always been far tOO 
small for the exhibits, staff and 
visitors, and working spaces for 
the staff are substandard," he 
said. Parking for the aquarium 
has long competed with the La 

Jolla Shores beach traffic. 
Also, the building is 

structuraUy unsound, Shor said. 
There are heavy saltwater tanks 
on the second floor which leak 
through the concrete, causing the 
steel reinforcement rods within 
the concrete to sweU, and 
ultimately the concrete cracks. 

Campus planner Marilyn Cox 
claims that it would cost far 
more to rebuild or rehabilitate 

the aquarium than to build a 
new one. 

These problems conc\usivrly 
lead to a need for a new Scripps 
aquarium museum, Shor said . He 
explains that the proposed new 

aquarium museum would be 
located 900 feet east of the 
present aquarium, adjacent to 
Scripps' WWB radio station 
towers. (The radio station is a 
ship communicating device.) 
Parking would replace the 
university dumping grounds 
known as Seaweed Canyon, JUSt 
east of the radio station.

O N MONDAY, UCSD celebrated the 25th anniversary of its 
November 18, 1960 foundIng 
with an all-campus birthday 
parry and formal convocation. 

Sunny weather, a free 
"celebration lunch," musIc by the 
Mar Dels and a 25-layer birthday 
cake drew approximately 1000 
people to the celebration on 
Muir field . Students ate , danced 
and listened to speakers give 
their impressions of the past 
predictions for the future of 
UCSD. 

Following a welcome from AS 
President Mary Rose Alexander, 
Dr. Ross Stone , a member of 
UCSD's class of 1967, the first 
group of graduates, gave some 
"verbal snapshots" of an infant 
UCSD. He said the first class at 
UCSD began with 161 students, 
but dwindled to 40, and ascribed 
the high attrition rate to rigorous 
academics , noting that "a 3.5 
GPA was required for admission." 

He said that many UCSD 
traditions began with those first 
students. "The UCSD recreational 
program evolved because 
students, faculty and staff said 
they wanted participatory rather 
than spectator sports. 

Dr. Richard Atkinson, UCSD's 
fifth chancellor said a few words 
about the state of the univerSity 
today. "UCSD is becoming well 
known nationally and 
internationally for its excellent 
faculty, outstanding academic 
program, first-rate students and 
excellent research rpgram." He 
cited the Gordon and Fisk 
reports which rank UCSD 12th 
and 13th respectively among 
American universities, and 
summarized, "UCSD has received 
a lot of recognition in its shorr 
existence." 

In 25 years, UCSD has

Another fish story contes between La Jolla & UCSD 
The forthcoming construction of the new Scripps Aquarium has again 

brought to light the seemingly never-ending conflict between the 
expanding community of UCSD, and the crypto-consetvationists of 
provincial La Jolla. Whether it be the brash politics of student activists 
or the ambitious designs of UC developers, the La Jolla community has 
never taken very kindly to "foreign intrusions" into the sovereign of 
native 'Jewels" concerning what La Jolla society should look like . This 
case is quite ironic, however, as one Ellen Scripps is frequently tenned 
as the "founding mother" of La Jolla by the traditionalists themselves, 
and we all know where her priorities lay in reference to public 
education over the wonders of marine life . 

In fact, because 01 this poor planning, La Jolla natives have enabled 
commercial developers (the University of California is not to be absent 
from this analysis either-take a look at Regents Park) to explOit the 
chiqueness of the area and subject us all to "condo-bondage." The 
community's dependence upon this "foreign" influx to fuel the growth of 
the service-sector cannot be denied nor simply ignored by the 
financially secure conselVationists and irate homeowners. The 
presetvation of La Jolla's "old-money culture" became a fruitless guest at 
the start of the 1960s when Americans really began to realize the 
potential of "California Dreamin'" and commenced a massive trek 
westward . 

The La Jolla conselVationists and their allies among the 
neighborhoods that surround the building site of the new aquarium, fear 
that this development will cause an avalanche of noisy tourists to 
descend upon their tranquil doorsteps at nearly double the rate that 
they do now. They envision a La Jolla Shores Drive that is congested 
with boisterous out-of-staters driving zinc-oxide all over their cleanly 
swept driveways; sun-bruned children are sure to be imitating blowfish 
in front of their picture windows. So the La Jollans attended the first 
public hearing surrounding the aquarium, anned with an Environmental 
Impact report that not only predicted the overabundance of tourists sure 
to deprive the neighborhoods of their privacy, but that stated that the 
new development would destroy some endangered native plants 
(supposedly cacti). The aquarium representatives qUickly disputed this 
repon, calling it hasty and ill-conceived. The La Jolians promptly threw 
their hands up and requested that another report be drawn up and 
addressed. 

La Jolla's most vivid attraction is its unusual, cordial co-existence with 
marine life. The new Scripps aquarium can add to this sometimes 
forgotten gift in a very unique and educational manner. By focusing on 
the downside of the aquarium's possible effects, the consetvationists are, 
by association , alienating themselves from a potentially natural 
development, that being greater awareness about the enonnous 
contributions granted to us, as human beings, by marine life. It is only 
by increased education about the intrinsic role of both marine life and 
marine scientists in such vital fields as food production, that those Iand-
loving tourists can come to respect our oceans, seas, lakes and rivers. 
Maybe if the La Jollans considered how different a tourist might feel 
about leaving his garbage strewn about the inlets of the Cove after 
visiting the wondrous tanks of a new Scripps aquarium, they might 
rethink their proposal to stop aquarium construction. The choice 
appears to be pretty clear. Either choose to placate yourself with a few 
more smiling tourists prancing about your neighborhood, or go to 

We understand how a community can grow embittered about the 
"despoiling" of its culture, its lands and its homogenity. La Jolla must 
realize , though, that it has built its economy on one industry-tourism. 

Shores beach and pick up the usual array of garbage left behind by 
uninformed visitors.

A sword unleashed 
Editor: 

I have, for a number of weeks 
now, wanted to write this letter. 
You may be pleased to know that 
it was your latest collective effon 
in the Opinions section of the 
November 18 issue of the 
Guardian that has been the 
catalyst for it. 

You conclude your editorial on 
"Suggestions" by lamenting the 
absence of a Journalism 
Department on our campus. A 
graduate school of this nature, 
you claim, ·would please many 
writers, who labor tirelessly 
without recognition , and without 
a support base." The implication 
being that with a school of 
journalism the unwearied 
endeavors of campus scribes 
would finally meet with the fruits 
of respect and backing by the 
student body. 

There are many [jne writers of 
poetry, prose, music and news 
on this campus. Some of these 
talented people write for the 
campuswide alternative media, 
some for depanmental 
pubhshings, others do so for 
their own and their friends' 
pleasure. However, with ve ry 
few exceptIons, none of these 
persons write for the UCSD 
Guardian, and as a resuh, It IS 
not a very good pubhcation. I 
will touch upon the deficienCies 
of your paper in a few moments, 
but for now [ would tike to 
comment on the lack of a "base 
of suppon and recognition" that 
Guardian wmers (editors) feel 
permeates the enure hterary 
commUni!) at UCSD 

The fau uf the matter 15 that 
there IS hroad wppon for man)' 
ltterar} gl'nrt's on campus. and 
hence for their writers I peak 
lor others as w~ll , when I say 
that t he lack of e ruuS<ll YOlo 
claim wnter~ rect!lve IS dlrelPed 

mainly to those of the Guardian 
and to the Guardian as an entity 
itself. which leads me to my next 
point. 

The Guardian is a poor 
example of a college newspaper. 
When comparing it to other 
major university publications 
such as those at UC Berkeley, 
San Jose State UniversitY. and 
UCLA, its inadequacies are 
vividly displayed . The Guardian 
does not repon events accurately. 
Its opinions are often presented 
in such a manner that they can 
easily be construed as simply 
skeptical reporting of factual 
information. Its discretionary 
poliCies with respect to the 
presentation of only one side of 
an issue leave much to be 
desired. Even its twice-weekly 
delivery to campus receptacles 
remains a thing of fate . Yet, 
probably the most disturbing 
aspect of Guardian policy is the 
.almost militant antagonism that 
the editorial staff and numerous 
staff writers engage in upon 
reponing of events, speCifically 
AS Council events Your 
ap.proach goes beyond 
constructive criticism and only 
engenders confrontation . This is 
unacceptable. It is my behef that 
consideration and not 
confrontation should be ~e goal 
of all media Media should seek 
to elucidate key issues and 
topics of concern and present 
them in such a manner as to 
allow for educated diSCUSSion on 
such concerns If the Guardwn

Fear of frats 
Editor: 

On behalf of the Greek 
organizations here at UCSD, I 
wish to respond to your paper's 
anicle "Our Far Aung Reporter's 
Visit With the AS" (NOV. 11 ), by 
Tina Rich . I was both saddened 
and dismayed in reading it. 
Saddened because the Guardian 
would devote valuable news 
space to cheap innuendo rather 
than balanced coverage of the 
issues involved and dismayed 
that once again some members 
of the Guardian staff felt it 
neces.sary to attack something 
they seem to feel threatened by 
- Greeks. 

One would think that a pape r 
like the Guardian would be 
IOterested in coveri ng the issues 
IOvolved in AS meetings III an

way to have a good time?" One 
could make the same statement 
of a newspaper, "Why must a 
newspaper cheapen itself with 
innuendos in order to make a 
story interesting?" It appears to 
me that perhaps Ms. Rich and 
the Guardian fear the Greeks at 
this schooL It is also cenainly 
clear that the Guardian does not 
understand them because if it 
did, statements such as the 
aforementioned would not have 
been made. 

In order to soothe the fears of 
Ms. Rich and the Guardian , I 
would like to reassure them -
we do nN bite: Greek letter 
organizations have been part of 
the conege experience since the 
American Revolution and every 
year their numbers grow larger. 
Here at UCSD, over 700 men 
and women belong to Greek 
letter organizations whose 
purpose is to improve and 
expand the undergraduate 
college experience. Members of 
fraternities and sororities 
contribute to other student 
organizations, work to improve 
campus social life , raise 

thou~nds of dollars for worthy 
charities, develop friendships , 
promote leadership development 
among their members, all of 
which lead to a greater college

Referenda: pieces of advice ... or mandates? 
By MONTE ROSEN, Staff W,,!er 

It IS nme [Q dispel the nonon 
that a student referendum can be 
Ignored because It IS only 
advIsory and nOt resolute . The 
referenda voted on by students 
last sprIng represent a tabulation 
of student opimon , and are not 
laws. However, for elected 
representatives. In college 
councils and the AsSOCiated 
Students. and for the student 
organizati ns who use student 
money. these referenda might as 
well be law. To represent 
students contrary to the SpIrIt of 
the referenda would be 
tantamount to ignoring the 
student mandate , which 
representa tives are elected to 
represent. This behavior is 
grounds for a recall referendum. 
Thus, regardless of personal 
political opinion, it is uneth ical 
for an individual or an 
organization supponed by 
student fees, to promote the 
presence of the CIA on campus. 

Responsibility is a highly 
debated quality in the realm of 
public practice, and in juridical 
practice, jail sentences hang in 
balance of the outcome of its 
interpretation. Elected 
representa tives often see their 
responsibilities in a different 
light than their constitutents, and 
the disparity is sometimes so 
great as to cause the breakdown 
of representational democracy all 
together. Elected reps have to be 
sensitive to the political climate 
of the masses they purpon to 
represent. They must act in such 
a manner which fulfills their 
constituencies' notion of 
responsible representation or else 
bear the hostile reactions. 

In the case of thc CIA summer 
internships through ASIO, 
perhaps council ignorance of the 
five-year existence of this 
phenomenon is an adequate 
excuse in its vision . But in the 
eyes of ItS constituency, it is 
another dismal display of 
unconcern . Granted , the council 
is doing its full share of work, as 
well as trying to maintain their 
own student Status, but 
somewhere the spirit of the 
referendum IS being lost. 

e take t e 

LlkeWlsc. ASIO's Ignonng thc 
democra tlc deciSIOn-making 
process on campous hy maklllg 
avai lable Information on CIA 
internships, whether Out of 
Innocence or guilt, IS a clear 
Indication of the present 
administrative ove rlook of the 
referenda . Cenainly, It is not 
illegal to work for the CIA, and 
some srudents might actually be 
Interested In the internships 
But , the bottom line IS that It was 
unethical for ASIO to proVide the 
IIlformation because I[ is 
c:o ntrary to the majority of 
students' opinion on how their 
money 15 to be spent. Legally, 
ASIO can do anything they want 
with the money altocated by the 
AS - anything means internship 
information for Ku Klux Klan, 
American Nazi Pany or any Other 
organization the ASIO deems 
imponant. Funher, the AS is 
powerless to revoke or withhold 
money because of this unethical 
practice, in order to guarantee 
political freedom. The civil 
libeny sword hangs over their 
heads. 

The insight available in this 
dilemma is that ethi CS aren't 
necessarily guaranteed by law, 
nor are ethical stands best 
pursued by democratic means. 
However, the taking of the moral 
high ground by students makes 
available actions which can 
return the ethical questions to 
ASIO and student 
representatives. Boycott is an 
effective means of convincing 
ASIO to fulfill student mandates, 
or less severe , a petition 
demanding ASIO's compliance. 
As for the political action at the 
representative level, responsible 
input is essential. If you are tired 
of seeing the AS respond with 
tired and ineffectual resolutions, 
demand money for an 
educational campaign , demand 
action with administrative 
officials to answer student needs 
according to student opinion, 
demand of the CIA to cease and 
deSist their activ~ties here and 
most of aU, indict your own 
apathy - a form of complicity 
with the CIA activities. ~

It looks as though a resolution 

proposed as a pragma\lc efron to 
appease a very well-backed 
heckler was adopted with httle 
dissent last ntght We hoped that 
the cacophonous vOice would 
not prompt AS members 10 
hasten the passage of the 
resolution In order to re-estabhsh 
harmony. but that the same 
voices will waken members to 
the serIousness of the ISSue and 
the Imponant implIcations of 
their vOte 

The deCISion whether or not 
to ban CIA internships offered 
by the AsSOCiated Students 
Internship Office (ASIO) cannot 
(should nOt) be an easy one . 
There is. however, a wrong vote 
- one cast without having 
invested it with sufficient 
thought 

The resolution is intended a~ 
an application of the outcome oT' 
a student referendum taken last 
spring. Referendum #2 read: "Do 
you suppon ending the use of 
student registration fees for the 
purpose of on-campus 
recruitment by military, the CIA, 
the Secret Service, the FBI and 
INS? 1,580 voted yes, 843 vOted 
no. Whether or not the 
resolution passed depended on 
how one interprets this 
referendum. 

The most obvious task at hand 
is the semantic interpretation. 
Can the presence of a piece of 
paper resting in a me shelved 
somewhere in the ASIO office 
which prospective interns may 
peruse in order to get an idea of 
die job responsibilities (active 
subversion is most likely not 
among them) possibly be 
construed as "recruitment?"

According to the Webster 
Dictionary, recrui tment IS 
defined as "to supply WIth fresh 
or additional members.' 

The answer IS, yes , It can be, 
and has been construed tn thiS 
way The referendum refers to 
"recruitment by the CIA . " Can 
one not argue that It was the 
ASIO that was recruiting for the 
purposes of Increasing the 
number of Interns not swelling 
the ranks of the Central 
Intelligence Agency There are 
myrIad semantic Circuits one can 
follow and while It is imponant 
to conSider alternatives before 
identifying the path leading to 
Truth, the more difficult deCision 
faced by the AS is how a 
referendum is to be used . 

The new and improved AS 
constitution artfully dodges this 
issue by elucidating on the 
nature of a referendum but 
making no reference to its 
application. Is a referendum 
advisory of resolute? There is no 
easy answer, for this question is 
one that has long plagued many 
political philosophers. If the 
student referendum is advisory, 
if a democra tic vote is not to be 
needed , and then made into law, 
then the notion of democracy is 
a farce. If. on the other hand , a 
referendum is resolute , and a 
meager majoriry, 1,580 students, 
can dictate universiry policy, 
then our system has fallen prey 
to an inherent malady, the 
tyranny of the majority, a very 
small, but active majority at that 
If a student referendum is held 
querrying students as to whether 
grades should be based entire ly 
on class panicipation and aU 

freshmen vote yes" (no one else 
votes, constderIng the Issue to be 
toO inane ), should the grading 
system be changed? We elect 
representatives, not only to 
translate the "public" wtll IOto 
poltcy, but also to serve as 
guardians of the democratIc 

~ystem hy which they were 
l hosen and to protect the 
Interests, to the extent pOSSible, 
of those who are sltghted by th~ 
process 

Voung on an Issue docs not 
make It legitImate . Referendum 
#2 was poorly conceived tn the 
sense that It would allow a smaU 
maJoney to abrogate the nghts of 
all students to have access to 
information about the CIA, the 
FBI and other IOstitutions 
deemed heinous. If not allowing 
them to recruit on campus is 
Intended as a symbolic slight to 
the institution, this could be 
better accomplished by allowing 
them to expend time and 
money, send a representative 
who will then be greeted by an 
empty interview schedule, 
frus tration and tedium. If. 
however, the referendum is 
intended as a way of protecting 
a misguided or naive student 
from being seduced into working 
for these institutions, who is to 
say that they are not being 
screwed by those who voted yes 
on referendum #2? 

The question of whether this 
referendum is good or bad is, 
unfonunately, now only 
academic. It has been submitted 
to the students and passed. Let 
us hope that in the future more 
thought will be given to the 
implications of proposals before 
they are presented for a vote. ~

Cruz revisited 
Editor. 

On October 23, the Coalition 
for a Free South Africa and other 
progressive groups mounted a 
powerful demonstration at the 
Institute of the Americas. At that 
time, Anuro Cruz, head of the 
political wing of the "Contras" (a 
military assemblage of ex-Somoza 
troops, disenchanted 
businesspeople, CIA agents and 
U.S. mercenancs - some war-
hungry veterans of Viemam). was 
paid to speak at the institute. A 
gala event was planned to be 
held in the institute garden , 
mcluding a formal reception a~d 
other civilities usually reserved 
for dignitaries of some repute. 
Our demonstration succeeded in 
preventing Cruz from eloquently 
pouring fOl1h the "Contra" 
position and raised questions 
regarding the institute's role in 
legitimizing this self-confessed 
CIA employee and political 
gangster. In light of criticism of 
our demonstration against Cruz 
from cenain quaners, the 
coalition feels that a detailed 
analysis and explanation of our 
tactic should be made. 

Cruz's visit to the institute 
must be viewed In the context of 
other simster political events, in 
that his visit cOincides with a 
recent escalation of right-wing 
and neo-fascist activity in San 
Diego. In the month of October, 
the Coca-Cola Company 
sponsored the "Educational 
Cultural Coalition," a grouping of 
"Contras" (such as Alpa 66) from 
Cuba, Viemam, Nicaragua and 
other countries with the Young 
Americans for Freedom, a right-
wing youth organization. Seeking 
to popularize themselves, and 
masking their real content with a 
cloak of cultural celebration, this 
assonment of mercenary 
organizations Staged events in 
Balboa Park for several 
weekends. In addition , members 
of the coalition were informed by 
the Young Amencans for 
Freedom that the F.D.N., the 
"Contra" organization 10 which 
Cruz plays a leading role, is 
setting up headquaners in San 
Diego. On October 30, Meir 
Kahane, a representative of the 
U.S. right wing in Israel and 
founder of the j.D.L and Terror 
against Terror, spoke at SDSU . 
Also, on ovember 6, Jeanne 
Kirkpatrick, spokesperson for the 
ultra-right of u.s. foreign policy, 
spoke at the Civic Center to a 
select audience. 

Against this backdrop, Anuro 
Cruz is invited to UCSD to 
panicipate in a lecture and an 
evening of genteel pleasantries 
which belie the real nature of his 
polities: terrorism, genocide, rape 

Much of the cntlcism, such as 
Russ Allyn's lener ro the 
Guardian , revolved around our 
alleged denial of Mr. Cruz's 
freedom of speech. The whole 
concept of freedom of speech in 
the American liberal tradition has 
become a distorted idol to some 
people in the United States. The 
media is largely controlled by a 
powerful minority who, in close 
alliance with the state authority, 
seek to maintain the status-quo 
by manipulation and guidance of 
public interpretation of, and 
reaction to, a situation. The 
whole concept of treedom of 
speech has become merely a rool 
by which those in power can 
control public reaction while 
maintaining an image of 
liberality. In any case, the 
"Contra" position in Nicaragua is 
the position of U.S. foreign 
policy in that country, and in no 
. y did our demonstration at 
the institute interfere with the 
freedom of speech of 
spokespeople of that position. In 
truth, it is President Reagan, 
Larry Speakes and George 
Schultz who al1iculate - and 
have full reign on the 
communications media - the 
position of the "Contras." Not 
only do they have complete 
freedom to aniculate their 
position, they use their elected 
office to finance that position 
with u.s. taxpayers'dollars. 
Twenty-seven million dollars was 
allocated this year to finance the 
"Contras," in addition to the 

Al1urc Cruz, who is one of the 
three foremost Contra leaders 
and who has a special rapport 
with Reagan, was paid to come 
to UCSD, to regurgitate the same 
lies and disinformation to which 
we are relentlessly exposed by 
the media. Thus his "freedom of 
speech" is always guaranteed in 
the form of U.S. state anitudes, 
speeches and policies. But in the 
absence of any willingness by the 
state or media to put forward the 
policies, achievements and aims 
of the F.S.l.N., and thus give 
them freedom of speech, it has 
become necessaty for individuals 
to actively demonstrate so that 
the media and people will hear 
and admit to the steadily 
growing voice of opposition to 
U.S. policy, and of support for 
the Sandinistas in combatting 
the infringement of their 
sovereigniry. 

The Sandinista government is 
an elected one with more 
legitimacy (as expressed in 
percentage of popular support) 
than, for example. the Re32an 
Administration. It is especially 
imponant for Americans to gain 
full understanding of the issues 
involved in Nicaragua in light of 
the considerable expenditures of 
taxpayers' dollars involved in 
propping up the "Contra" war. 

Mr. Allyn continues the 
traditional anti-Sandinista stance 
by attacking the demonstrators 
who turned out to voice their 
opposition to Mr. Cruz and U.S. 
foreign policy: but instead of a

It is therefore of the utmost

thoroughly inform themselves In 
order to monitor and control our 
government's policies, which in 
Central America do not serve the 
interest of the American people , 
but rather those of such 
corporations and businesses that 
have experienced a loss with the 
fall of Somoza, and the 
ascendancy of a truly popular 
and nati.:>ral government in 
Nicaragua.

Aquarium 
Continued from page 3 

The aquarium is presently a 
priority in the 25th anniversary 
campaign fund . This fund 
probably will not cover the entire 
COSt of the project, Cox said . 

Shor estimates that there will 
be 400,000 visitors per year at 
the new aquarium - 325,000 
people a year visit the "old" 
aquarium. 

Some of the homeowners in 
the neighborhood believe there 

would be at least twice as many 
tourists anracred to the location. 
Shor explains, "There is no plan 
for a commercial entenainment 
facility. We will continue to 
emphaSize education of school 
children , and of the general 
public, about marine sciences." 

A number of infuriated La Jolla 
residents attended the first 
public hearing to address the 
plans for the "new" aquarium. 
Residents presented a draft of 
the Environmental Impact 
Repon, which StateS that there 
are endangered native plants 
growing at the proposed 

development site . According to 
Shor, "No native plant 
assemblage exists in the 
intended aquarium-museum site 
or its parking area." He adds that 
there are many corrections to be 
made in the EIR. 

Another sensitive issue at the 
hearing concerned the impact 
that the plan would have on 
surrounding neighborhoods. As 
quoted in the San Diego Union, 
homeowner Edith Kodmur 

asked, "Should this kind of major 
public facility impose upon a 
remote and sensitive canyon site 
adjoining a now-quiet residential 
neighborhood?" 

The bUilding site is apparently 
1,500 feet from nearby houses 
and the parking lot site is 800 
feet from the nearest visible 
house , which indicates that the 
new aquarium would not, to any 
large extent, threaten the 
neighborhood's view. Shor 
funher explains that the parking 
lot is shielded from view by a 
high ridge. 

Some neighboring residents 

argue that a possible traffic 
problem would result in excess 
noise . Others claim that the new 
roads proposed for easier access 
to the aquarium would reduce 
congesti on in the La Jolla Shores 
area. One road would come from 
La Jolla Shores Drive and the 
other from Torrey Pines Road . 
The sound of traffic may be 
muffled a bit by the hills, 
however there is still a possibility 
of noise pollution . 

Pat Kampman, education 
coordinator at Scripps, maintains 
that the aquarium serves as an 
educational institution. Scripps 
conducts 250 different types of 
researcdh including long-range 
weather predictions, earthquake 
predictions and penguin studies. 
The studies are conducted by a 
research group called Nopax, 
and the data is collected by a 
satellite located near La Jolla 
Shores Drive. Kampman stated , 
"We are primarily interested in 
education. Forty thousand kids a 
year come to our outreach 
program in the classrooms. This 
isn't like Sea World or the zoo." 

The tanks, ranging from 700-
2,000 gallons, and the outside 
tidep.x>l contain 1,500 different

Atkinson , The faculty includes 
eight Nobel laureates, five of 
whom still teach at UCSD, Fony-
seven faculty members belong to 
the National Academy of 
Sciences, a membership that 
places the university behind 
Harvard and Stanford, but ahead 
of Yale and PrincetOn. In federal 
fiscal year 1983" UCSD received 
$155 million in federal grants 
and contracts-the sixth highest 
amount in the country , Scripps 
Institute of Oceanography is 
arguably the best research center 
of its kind in the world and 
UCSD medical center is "rapidly 
gaining prestige," Atkinson said. 

David P. Gardner, preSident of 
the University of California, 
spoke about the future of UCSD, 
praising the university founding 
fathers , Roger Revelle and Clark 
Kerr, for their "vision , 
commitment, energy and skill. 
without which we wouldn't be 
here today." He noted that more 
UCSD graduates go on to 
graduate school than any OIher 
UC grads, and predicted that 
"some of the University of 
California's brightest chapters 
will be written at UCSD." 

Birthday presents for UCSD 
were presented by several 
groups, Mark Broughton , 
president of the Alumni Club, 
presented a glass "memorabilia 
case" to be installed in the 
student center. UCSD also 
received a check for $1135 from 
the Retirement Club, a 
commemorative flag from the 
Staff Association and scrolls from 
the Faculty Association; 

Robert Lewis, commissioner 
University Center unveiled an 
artist's drawing of the new 
University Center. He said the 
drawings were un-detailed 
because only the preliminary 
designs were available-"the 
architect still has a lot of work." 
The new center will be eight 
times the size of the present 
facility and is projected for 
completion in 1988. 

A formal convocation followed 
by a reception tOok place later in 
the afternoon at Mandeville 
Center. UCSD's founding fathers 
and future leaders gathered to 
praise gains made by the 
university and to project goals 
for the next quarter century. 

"Twenty five years ago, few 
would have dared predict the 
leap into the top ranks of 
American universities that UC 
San Diego has managed so 
quickly and so well ," UC 
president David p, Gardner satd . 
"Twenty five years from now, tf 
this campus builds on the solid 
foundation of the past, UCSD 
will have scaled new heights," 
Gardner called for an emphasis 
on undergraduate education and 
a concentration on Paci fic RIM 
studies in particular. 

Chancellor Richard C 
Atkinson said the key to UCSD's 
continued growth and success is 
to "ensure an excellent faculty, 

Clark Kerr, preSident emeritus 
of the University of California, 
was given the university's Revelle 
medal for his efforts to open a 
campus in San Diego. Kerr 
praised the leadership of Roger

director for the Scripps Institute 
of Oceanography, Revelle 
recruited UCSD's prestigious first 
faculty members. Nearly 800 
people stood and applauded as

ReNU seeks to renew camaraderie 
By TRISH BROWN 

"You're 33 years old and you're 
a junior? What's wrong with 
you?" (From a conversation 
recently overheard in the 
Rathskeller.) 

Nothing's wrong - that 
person's just out of sync, he's 
one of UCSD's forgotten 
minority, the reentry students. 
ReNU , a campus organization for 
returning students, defines a 
reentry student as anyone at least 
five years older than the nonnal 
age for their class level. Another 
definition. used by some of the 
colleges for orientations, 
categorically puts anyone 25 or 
older into this minority group. 

A little more than 8 percent of 
UCSD's undergraduates are at 
least 25 years old. Dr. Beverly 

Ha~u of UCSD's Psychological 
and Counseling Services helped 
organize ReNU two years ago as 
a support group to help deal 
with the special issues reentry 
students face. But the group is 
now loosely organized, only 
meeting Friday afternoons at the 
Pub for end-of-the-week 
socializing. It seems that being 
past a cenain age and back in 
school are not ties that bind 
people together as strongly as 
race, ethnicity or gender. 

Harju says, "One of the 
problems is that there's an 
awfully wide age span. To say 
that everyone between the ages 
of 25 and 70 are a core group is 
flippant . There are some retired 
military men here, there are 
women in their 60s, there are 
married family people, some 
young singies, older singles, just 
such a range of interests." 

Time pressures also push 
against the reentry group. 
Students of any age feel there's 
never enough time to get 
everything done, but for the 
returning students those 
problems are multiplied. Janet 
Ranshous, one of the students 
who founded the original ReNU 
group , says, "There are 24 hours 
in a day, but family, earning a 
Wjlge, children and commuting 
all serve to eat up huge hunks of 
time." She suggests that to take 
more hours away from these 
areas and to put the time into 
something on campus (like 
ReNU ), is asking a lot from 
people. 

The students complain of not 
being able to schedule classes in 
a block of time; one class might 
be at 9, another at noon and 
another at 3, leaving gaps of time 
which still aren't long enough for 
a job. And most classes are held 
during the day, making it hard 
to work full time and still attend 
UCSD. 

Chips Dreilinger, dean of Muir 
College, admits the university 
"doesn't bend very much" to 
accomodate non-traditional 
students. ·We do relatively little 
in terms of offering regular, 
academic courses evenings or 
weekends. The extension has an 
excellent program, but most of 
that won't count toward a degree. 
And it remains pretty difficult to 
get approval to become a part-
time student here." 

Adding to these difficulties, 
some older students feel 
uncomfortable when they first go 
back to school, worrying that 
they won't fit in, or won't do 
well DreiHnger says that kind of 
"paranoia" is fairly common 
among reentry students, 
especiaUy those who've been out 

of school for a while and are 
reentering now at UCSD. They 
fear "that these young whizzes 
are coming here, a\l 
valedictorians and all used to 
using math , having taken 
calculus in high school last year." 
But although many reentry 
students initially feel at a 
disadvantage in comparison to 
the younger students, he says, "I 
think virtu~lly all the reentry 
students overcome that , but it 
takes sometimes up to a year to 
work it through." 

Reentry students live in twO 
worlds, that of their "real life" 
and that of the student. Those 
worlds often remain separate. 
Dennis Precourt started at UCSD 
when he finished high school, 
but later left school for a while. 
Now back, he says, "You see the 
university as outside the center 
of your life; home is the center. 
When you're at school, that's not 

and eventually helping to form 
Re U. 

Cleo Hoggan is not a member 
of ReNU, but she is a full-time 
undergraduate at the age of 68. 
She was a management services 
officer in the economics 
department at UCSD until her 
retirement in 1980. Now she's 
back to get a degree in history, 
simply for her own enrichment, 
she says. She feels that one thing 
she misses because of her age is 
the opportunity for group study 
with other students, but adds, "I 
might find someone (to study 
with) if I were more aggressive 
about it ." 

Part of her experience as a 
student here is reminiscent of 
Janet Ranshous' invisibility. Mrs. 
Hoggan says she's always "felt we 
all have a social responsibility to 
each other. Young people can 
fulfill that by going into student 
government, but that's not 

new lield opening up in student 
affairs, and to be more 
marketable 1 need to get my 
master's," she says. "For: anyone, 
especially single women, we all 
need to enhance whatever 
options we have." 

She says the other students 
have been very supponive, 
"especially the ones who work 
with me." They tell her they're 
glad she's going back to school 
because it helps her understand 
their problems bener. "They're 
loving this," she says with a 
laugh. "They tell me 1 drive them 
nuts before I have a test." 
- Levin says being both student 

and administrator is a matter of 
"learning to put on different hats. 
I'm a stUdent, then I'm not. 
Sometimes it's hard to get out of 
a class and step back into my 
administrative mode." 

Many reentry students transfer 
to UCSD, or have been out of 

ReNU, a reentry studtnt organiZation, gathers at the UCSD pub for weeklY "meetings?" Hmmmm ... 

a place to relax - that time's on 
tuition money, so it must be 
used wisely." 

Older students sometimes feel 
they aren't integrated into the 
general student popUlation. Janet 
Ranshous transferred to UCSD 
from a school that :'had senior 
citizens, so coming from there to 
here was a bit of a shock." 
friendly, outgoing and attractive, 
Janet doesn't seem like someone 
who'd have trouble meeting 
people. Still, "I'd sit down next to 
someone in a classroom," she 
remembers, "and I'd say 'Hi' and 
introduce myself. But I got almost 
no response. I felt invisible, not 
recognized . After about twO 
weeks I just stopped talking to 
people." 

Then one day while she was 
out hitting tennis balls, a young 
man started making 
conversation. "I was so happy," 
she says. "Someone wanted to 
talk with me. Then I guess my 
ring caught the light ~.s I 
gestured, and he said, 'Dh. Are 
you married?' When I said yes, 
he just turned and walked away 
without another word." That 
experience sent her looking for 
other non-traditional srudents, 

appropriate for someone my 
age ." Instead, she says, "I 
decided I could smile at people 
and spread some happiness." 
She tried that on campus, and 
the results surprised her. "I've 
found that , in general, the young 
men are much friendlier to me 
than the young women. Some of 
them (the young women) don't 
seem to see me. I expected the 
reverse ." 

Many returning students feel 
very well-accepted by traditional 
students. Some tum being older 
into an advantage. Carol 
Templeton is a full-time student 
with two children and a part-
time job. She feels being older 
than many of her classmates 
allows her to say things she 
wouldn't have said at 18, like her 
recent compliment to a young 
man in her math class on his 
"set of gorgeous shoulders." She 
says, "The kids at UCSD are the 
cream of the crop. Most of them 
accept me as a person, and that's 
important" 

Gail levin works on campus 
as a Student Affairs Officer at 
Edna, but she's also finishing up 
her bachelor's degree in literature 
here. Then she plans to go to 
graduate school. -There's a whole 

school only for a few years 
before returning. But Bruce Luke 
entered UCSD after a 20-year 
absence. He had to drop out of 
school in the eighth grade, but 
says he taught himself while he 
worked to support his family. 
"When the time came that I 
could go back to school, I quit 
work, took the GED (in lieu of a 
high school diploma), then took 
the SATs and came in by 
examination because I didn't 
have any high school records." 

Bruce wants to go to medical 
school. "It's a long haul, but it's 
what I always wanted to do. I'll 
probably get my degree and my 
appliction for social security at 
the same time," he says 
cheerfully. Meanwhile he plans to 
take advantage of as many 
university-related opportunities 
as he can, including the 
Cambridge University Program 
and the Dartmouth Exchange 
Program, as well as a quarter 
spent studying in Mexico. 

faculty, staff and 
administrators see rerurning 
students as Slrontdv motivated, 
committed and c1tir about their 
goals. Dean Dreillnger says 
they've learned to 

"compartmentalize their lives and 
concentrate fully on studying 
when they're studying, on their 
families when they're with their 
families and on their jobs when 
they're at work." He thinks they 
manage to do "more in a 24-
hour period than a lot of 
freshmen would imagine 
possible , and more than most 
freshmen would think is 
desirable ." 

Ellen Quinn, who was a 
reentry undergraduate at UC 
Davis, works at Muir College as 
administrative assistant to the 
dean. She says, "It's a lide bit 
harder when you're older and 
trying to hold down a 4O-hour a 
week job to support yourself and 
also further your education." 
She's JUSt completed a master's 
degree at the University of San 
Diego, so she knows what it's 
like to be a student now. Asked 
if being a reentry student 
presents any problems, she jokes, 
"I think I'll be p;lying back 
financial aid until the day I die!" 
Then she adds seriously, "But 

.education is a priority of mine 
and that's just something you 
have to live with." 

Even though university 
policies don't actively encourage 
older students, many of the 
people in the administration at 
UCSD are supportive and quite a 
few were reentry students 
themselves, or, as in the case of 
Chips Dreilinger, have one in 
the immediate family. 

Rebecca Garcia-Babb, acting 
academic coordinator at Third 
College, went back to college 
after being out for seven years. 
While juggling 'the duties of 
parenting, working and going to 
school, she formed - with other 
Third World, single-parent 

. students - her own support 
group that "really kept me going, 
helped me survive," she says. 

Garcia-Baab says she would 
~ welcome the chance to see more 
d reentry students at UCSD, to be 

"a liaison for them and give 
them some support when it gets 
rough." 

Chifs Dreilinger saw the other 
side 0 the reentry student 
problem when his wife went 
back to school to finish up pre-
med courses and then entered 
medical school, moving into a 
dorm and leaving him to cope 
with their three small sons. After 
med school she did a residency, 
then a two-year fellowship at 
Scripps Clinic. 

That kind of experience 
probably made him sympathetic 
to the cause of the returning 
student. He says, "Three or four 
years ago I drew up a proposal 
for a fifth college at UCSD, to be 
designed to meet the specific 
needs of reentry students." 
Unfortunately, it didn't generate 
much interest. 

A college geared to their needs 
would have been a godsend to 
returning students. Failing that, 
they can still get some support 
from each other. Red-haired, 
enthusiastic Julie Wert, currently 
an officer of ReNU, enjoys the 
Friday afternoons at the Pub, but 
she'd like to see the group 
become more organized -
maybe find somewhere else to 

m~et, and begin to focus on 
more than the social aspect of 
getting together. Lack of funds 
and available space, as weD as 
time constraints, make this a 
difficUlt wk. R:J

Helene Keyssar has been 
overflOwing with energy. She 
explains, "When I was a kid, my 
mother remembers times when 
we had just done some big 
adventure, and ten minutes later 
I would say. 'I'm bored. What am 
I goinl! to do now?'" 

Today, she has channeled that 
abundance of energy into not 
only chairing the 
Communication Department, but 
also into teaching, writing and 
directing. "What people most 
often say about me is that I have 
a great deal of energy. People are 
always asking, 'How do you 
manage to do it all?' Some . 
people think I'm greedy. I'm nOt 
willing to just pick one thing. I'm 
the person who wants not only 
'( to have) my cake and eat it 
toO,' but I want bread and butter 
as well. 

"I'm always trying to do too 
many things at once, and as a 

result, I'm always five to ten 
minutes late for everything. I 
tend to talk fast and move fast," 
she continues. 

was a very good school , liked the 
area, and, having two permanent 
jobs at a place that was a high 
quality school, came here." 

Presently, Helene is teaching a 
course in interactive television . 
She says, "I'm very much 
enjoying teaching the course, 
which brings together both the 
research project that I'm working 
on with interactive television 
with the Soviet Union and a 

Commendation from the U.S.

project was initiated by the

The Space Bridges project is 
designed to' "help diminish the 
mutual misunderstanding and 

covered live on the Cable News 
Network in the United States 
and Japan. A one-and-a-half 
hour version was broadcast 
nationally in the Soviet Union 
last June . In addition , a one hour 
version is being aired by PBS 
amliates nationally over the next 
few months. "Glory Days" is 
de~igned to explore the values, 
attitudes and behavior of young 
people between the ages of 16 

almost three years ago. There 
had been an initial attempt at 
something like this with the U.S. 
Rock and Roll festival. Friends 
of his in the Soviet Union 
suggested that we could do 
something together focused on 
children and film. 

"Professor Cole came back, we 
talked about it, we talked to -
Sherman George, head of the ' 
Media Center, and we started 
doing it. We did that first one 
("Moscow Calling San Diego: 
Children and Film") in four 
weeks and the seed was sown, 
and it's built since then. 

Helene Is not just interested in 
bridging the communiction gaps 
between different countries, but 
in communication as a whole. 
"in some ways , I've always been 
interested in it (communication). 
I've always been somebody who 
has been interested in writing 
and production and in various 
media and various aspects of 
communication, in the written 
word, in performance, in theater, 
film, television . In one way, I've 
always been doing it; on the 
other hand , I've had to learn a 
lot and it's been a challenge and 
it's been worthwhile." 

Oftentimes, her busY schedule 
prevents her from doing some of 
the things she enjoys most. "I 
don't ever have enough time to 
read, so I read on airplanes," she 
admits. "One of my greatest 
pleasures is my children, and I 
never feel I spend enough time 
with them. When I am with 
them, I adore it, but at the same 
time, I know I'm someone who 
loves to, and needs to, do this 
other work." 

Helen Ktyssa~-UCSD Communication Department Chairperson, professor, director and author-"Feminism 
and the women s movemtllt have been IItI)' important to me and what 1 do." 

Besides working on the Space 
Bridges project, she has also 
written three books: The Curtain 
and the Vail , about Black 
American theater; 11 biography 
called Right in Her Soul: The Life 
of Anna Louise Strong; and her 
latest, called Frntinist Theatre. 
Currently, she is working on two 
books - one on the films of 
Robert Altman, the other on the 
Space Bridges project. 

. Prior to their arrival at UCSD, 
Helene and her husband , Tracy 
Strong, chairman of the Political 
Science Department, both taught 
at Amherst University. They were 
both eventually offered two 
permanent positions at UCSD 
and they "knew that the school

being chosen as a recipient of 
the 1985 Peace and Friendship

1983 served as a model for the

A FTER HEARING about all of the complications that the 1985 UCSD women's 
volleyball. tcam has faced this 
year, one would tend to think 
that the season would be chalked 
up to experience. But, despite a 
rash of mJuries and inconSistent 
play that plagued the Tntons, Ihe 
season IS not over yet. After 
ftnlshmg 26-18 overall , 14-2 in 
DIVISIon III , and lvith a number-
clght rankmg in the nation , the 
UCSD women spikers have once 
again gained a Spot in the CAA 
DiVISion III playoffs 

As hc has stressed throughout 
the season in general, coach 
Doug Dannevik said [hat they 
would take each game -
including the playoffs - in 
stride, one game at a time. The 
next match that his team faces 
will be against the winner of the 
first round of western regional 
championships, either laVerne 
or Claremont. Dannevik expects 
laVerne to beat Claremont 
because they have beaten them 
twO times in a row. UCSD, on 
the other hand, is undefeated 
against laVerne, having beaten 
them four times in a row, each 
time with a different lineup (due 
to injuries). This proves that the 
Tritons have been flexible 
enough to remain competitive. 

The winner of the western 
regionals will advance to play 
Colorado College, a team that 
UCSD lost tp once this year in 
Colorado. Oannevik feels that it 
would be highly beneficial to 
host that round here at UCSD, 
and to do so, stresses the need 

to get large fan support and a 
good crowd, "much hke the 
soccer team did ." Not only IS this 
a psychological ploy for home-
COUn advantage, but also a 
financial one , an attempt to 
prove 10 the NCAA that It is 
more beneficial to host playoffs 
here as opposed to Other SiteS, 
"If we get a good crowd, If we 
make money, then the chances 
of us hosting against the next 
round would be a lot better than 
If nobody shows up Sarurday 
night ," Dannevlk claimed , 
"because we will have to 
continually battie more teams 
east of the Mississippi than 
west." 

To get to the "Final Four," the 
NCAA championships, the 
Tritons have to win only the rwo 
matches against either laVerne 
or Claremont, and Colorado 
College. Dannevik said that 
UCSD received a good draw this 
year, because they will not meet 
a team that is seeded ahead of 
them (Gustavus Adolphus), until 
the semi-finals. The 1984 TrilOns 
defeated GA last year in three 
straight games, "That is great for 
us, because we need the time to 
practice and to rest ," admitted 
Dannevik. "We haven't played 
well lately ... not poorly, but not 
like what the UCSD volleyball 
team usually does at the end of 
the year." Dannevik thinks that 
the Tritons haven't been playing 
to win , but to gain experience, 
and he hopes that the older and 
more experienced players, like 
captains Monica Bradley and 
Christy Wada, will take charge of 

this young tcam. Br.ldley and 
Wada arc thc only veterans of 
post-season playoffs , and were 
members of last year's 
championship team. 

Dannevlk said that "the tcam 
knows what this is aU about . , 
lhey're pan of a program thaI 
has been In the finals four years 
In a row," The team as a whole 
feels thaI the other teams in Ihc 
fie ld would have to play really 
well in order 10 beat them Bolh 
Bradley and Wada feel that they 
have a great chance of winning, 
but they will need to work hard . 
"Our ability 10 play really weU is 
there ," said Wada, "and as long 
as we have all our mental 
attitudes geared towards 
winning, then we will definitely 
win . .. we all depend on each 
other." Bradley agreed, saying 
that "physically we have the 
ability to beat these teams, it 's 
JUSt mentally sometimes we get 
down and don't play well 
together. 

The Tritons play their first 
match on the road to the "Final 
Four" on Saturday night at 7 :30 
in the Main Gym. It will be a 
good indicator of whether or not 
the team can come together at 
the end of this transition season 
of building and rebuilding, and 
continue to set a new precedent, 
UCSD has already been in the 
finals an unprecedented four 
years in a row - an 
unprecedented fifth NCAA 
championship banner will prove 
that UCSD women's volleyball 
tradition is still alive and well in 
1985. ~ 

~ Hoop opener moved against hosting the volleyball, I support it; It's great. But the fact 
that my openmg game is betng 
transferred from a Friday night 
game to a Sarurday afternoon 
game is bullshit." to 4:30 pDt Saturday 

Not dwelling on the 
postponement, Marshall looks 
ahead to the Saturday opener 
against the University Redlands 
with apprehensive excitment. He 
said, "This may be one of the 
most ~pon;mt game5 all year. 
They are a Division III team thaI 
went to Nationals last year, and 
so they're the team to beat. They 
were ranked in the NCAA News

end Triton soccer season 
By JOHN SCHACHT, Sports EdUor 

T HE WEATHER-HELD advantage? Sure, everyone's heard of the 
home-field advantage but the 
weather-field advantage, now 
that's a new one, Unfortunately 
for the 1985 men's soccer team, 
laSt Sunday's weather-field 
advantage went to the home 
team, Washington University of 
SI. Louis. Parlaying 10 days of 
soggy weather into a 0-0 tie after 
90 minutes of regulation and two 
ovenimes, Washington beat 
UCSD )-1 in the shoot-out 
format to move on to the 
quarterfinals of the NCAA 
Division 111 National 
Championships. 

How, you may ask, does a 
team employ the weather-field 
advantage? "The soggy field 
played right into their hands," 
said Coach Derek Annstrong. 
"Their style of play was vel)' 
defensive, and the wet field 
proved conducive to that style of 
play. They packed aD of their 
players into the last 12 yards of 
the field , and it made it vety 
difficult for our wingers to get 
around them-they just didn't 
leave us enough room to operate 
in ." 

Triton domination was such 
that Washington managed a total 
of twO shots on goal for the 
entire game, including both 
overtimes. But they had five 
more in the shoot-out format , 

and made most of their 
opportunities, sending three of 
their penalty box kicks past 
Triton goalie, Alberto Gomez. 
Despite the outcome, Armstrong 
remained adamant about his 
club's performance. "We played 
one of our best games: he said , 
adding that "if anything, we 
played too much soccer. Unlike 
our other playoff games, we 
weren't nervous or tentative at 
all . We came right after them." 
One immediate sign of the 
Triton'S aggressiveness-as well 
as WashinRton's defensive 

the Tritons in scoring. 

strategy- occurred when 
Washington pulled their number-
one goal scorer out after the first 
five minutes and relaced him 
with - you guessed it- another 
defense man. "They were 
doubling up on us ," Armstrong 
said of Washington's strategy, 
"and we did a good job of 
getting the ball to the other side 
of the field , only it takes so long 
on a sloppy field they had time 
to get over with no harm done . 
We just couldn't get behind them 
on that damn field ." 

Aside from double-teaming the 
ball, Washington rarely tackled 
the ball. "They stayed on their 
feet most of the game, and didn't 
give us vel)' many free kicks ," 
Armstrong said , "and we were 
hoping we could have had more 
(free kicks) against them." Even 
without many free kicks and 
despite the soggy conditions, the 
Tritons did have their chances. 
I n the fi rst half alone , Greg 
Schwarz, Joe Giaclone and 
Robert Paterson had shots on 
goal stopped by Washington 
goalie John Konsek. In the first 
ovenime, Scon Strommer hit the 
crossbar and Phil Kenney fired 
wide on the rebound , 'We really 
outplayed them in the 
ovenimes," Armstrong said, Ubut 

, we couldn't get the breaks. But 
their goalie deserves a lot of 
credit, because he did nothing

SPORTS 

The Claremont victory set a precedent for future pklyoJfs at UCSD, 

wrong the entire game ." 
Annstrong credited the 

advanced scouting report he had 
received on Washington for his 
coaching strategy that, in 
retrospect, may have proved 
fatal. "They had beaten th e 
defending champs (Wheaton) 
JuSt last week by scoring a goal 
with only 1:27 left when the 
Wheaton coach decided to bring 
one of his defensemen up to 
increase the pressure. They were 
waiting for us to do the same 
thing all game long-in 
hindSight maybe we should have 
moved a defensernan up and 
taken our chances. I thought it 
wouldn't come down to the 
shoolout." 

Employed as a means to avoid 
the infinite amount of ovenimes 
required to break a tie , the 
shoot-out format is not without a 
history of controversy, "Evety 
coach I've talked to is against the 
shootout," Annstrong claims, 
"including UCLA's and 
Claremont Mudd's coaches. 
Given the importance of the 
games, they should be played on 
Saturdays with a provision for 
another game on Sunday. The 
second gate would cover the 
extra costs, and you've already 
got the visiting team there for 
rwo days (Sarurday and Sunday) 
anyway. We'd fancy our chances 
in are-play."

.YOUR BODY IS UNDER

... By a swarm of viruses. There are 
no medicines that cure the . 
common cold. but cheer up! It will 
only last from 4-10 days. During 
these trying times you can do 
several things to make yourself feel 
better. and help your body get rid 
of those nasty VIruses. 

1) Gel Rtsl-
Relax. (like It easy. especially 

slow it down. 
2) loIS oj Fluuls-

At least 8 glasses of Juil:es. 
The fluids will thin you mucus 
so you can breathe more easily 
and will ease yout cough. 

But sorry ... alcohol does not 
COUnt, it takes OUt more than it 
pUIS in. ThiS also Includes 
smoking-your throat is 
irritated as It is already. 

Good 01' chicken soup sure 
does the trick. [t has warmth for 
your throat and has vitaminS for 
your body and It even tastes 
good too!! 
J) Garglc-

Use warm water and a tSp. of 
s,alt per 8 oz. glass. Gargle every 
hour. This is the cheapesl, 
safesl and probably the besl 
way to relieve Ihe swelling and 
irritation Ihal makes your throat 
sore.

Spodighton: FSPB 
The Revelle Annual Casino Night, The Evening of Comedy and 

Juggling, Provost Luncheons, Fireside Chats, and a reception with the 
Admissions Office r from UCSD Medical School are just some of the 
activities that the Revelle Faculty Student Programming Board has 
sponsored this year. 

Other activities held so far have included a tour of the UCSD 
Medical School Neonatal department, and the Humanities 
information forum held last week. "All of the activi lies we 've planned 
so far have turned out really great! The turnout at all the events has 
been really remarkable and everyone has thoroughly enjoyed 
themselves," comments Heather Bridgeman, FSPB chairman. 

Other activities that are being planned for next quarter include a 
"behind the scenes" tour of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, 
faculty luncheons, additional fireside chats , and a special program in 
which each Human ities student wiU have the opportunity to have 
lunch with their professor, TA, and discussion section group. 

According to Bridgeman, the committee consists of seven "hard-
working, dedicated , and enthusiastic members who work really well 
tOgether and are looking forward to the upcoming quaner." The 
members include: Stacy Caputo,jerfi Cicin, Tammy Kaufman , Shanna 
Rondberg, Bamara Steams, Bea Torrado, and Suzanne Wu. 

FSPB has many goals for next quarter, some of which include 
providing activities that are wonhwhlle to both students and faculty 
members; ac ti VI ties that will enhance the student/ faculty relationship, 
Whi le at thc same tlme proVide activllies that will be both fun and 
enJoyabl for everyone. The committee hopes that future events will 
maintain their goa ls, being lUll , Spen ... cular Pleasant, and BeneficIal!

But !nere will be no replay, at 

least not this season, and the 
bottom line still comes down to 
the number of goals scored in 
the shootout. And according 10 
the winning goalie Sunday, the 
whole process is based solely on 
luck. "A goalie has to pick a 
comer and simply dive for the 
ball," said Konsek, "I guessed 
right every time ." In a game of 
skill and conditioning, it does 
seem a bit odd to have the 
outcome rely on a roll of the

up snake-eyes for the Tritons. 

Tm sad about losing some of 
the seniors that have helped put 
this program on the map," 
Armstrong said of seniors Denis 
Guttridge, Alberto Gomez, Phil 
Kenney, Barry Thompson and 
Vic Skvama. "Some of these lads 
have been here all four of my 
years here, and I'm sorry to see 
them go. It's a shame that we 
couldn't bring back another game 
to San Diego. I know we 'd an like 
to thank everyone in the college 
for their suppOrt." 

The Tritons are only losing 
five players this year, so 
optimism runs high about the 
future of the Triton program. "I 
think we'll be even stronger next 

"We want to thank the college for their support .. . "

season," said Annstrong, "and we 
set some precedents that may 
allow us 10 host these games in 
the future ." But this year's 
dreams died in the mud and 
slush of SI. Louis when the 
Tritons were close to it all. Now 
the process begins again . "I really 
felt that the Washington game 
was the game for us. We were on 
the road, against a hostile crowd 
and in the worst conditions, and 
we held them scoreless. We'd 
have won the whole thing if we'd 
beaten them." Instead, they will 
have to settle for their Far West-

knowledge that they have gained 
the respect and support of a 
campus through fair weather or 
foul. • ~

look. Gone is the cowboy get,up in favor of a 
neater appearance. Fringe jackets have been 
replaced with black leather ones. Hair has been 
trimmed. In short, an image change. 

"We've definitely changed," says drummer 
Nigel Twist. "In a way it's just like moving on -
the band has moved on a lot. Everybody changes, 
y'know. We've just matured a lot and we've 
changed! 

"We wan~ to express ourselves mainly through 
our music and that's how it should be. It shouldn't 
be seen in any other light. I mean, a lot of people 
take the image first and say, 'Okay, we can 
pigeonhole this band because of what they're 
wearing.' And, well, we don't like that, y'know 
what I mean? Immediately, about a year and a half 
ago, people used to look at us and think, because of 
our haircuts and the cowboy gear, 'Yeah, okay. 
We've got these guys sorted out. We know what 
they're about,' without really listening to what 
we're about. Now we're giving them the 
opportunity to sit back and listen to the music and 
let the music speak." 

The Alarm's second album, Strength, does 
"speak" - of love, hope and strength: words that 
recur throughout the ten songs. So important are 
these ideas that they are seen as the essentials of life 
in three songs. "I'm just going to sing about the 
things that I need, a little bit of love, a little bit of 
hope, a little bit of strength, some fuel for the fire" 
("Deeside")j "Have I got enough love? Have I got 

Enough stt:enRth to face the world 

Vol. 10, No.9 November 21, 1985 

each day?" -("Dawn Chorus"); and " Give me love, 
give me hope, give me strength, give me someone to 
live for" ("Strengt~"). 

Music that once was rebellious is no longer. 
With songs like "68 Guns" and "Marching On," 
the band's first album, Declaration, spoke of 
standing up for yourself and fighting for what you 
believe - rebel rousing. 

"We've had a lot of criticism about 'brandishing 
our wares,' as it were, a little too much," explains 
Twist. "What we've attempted to do on Strength is 
make it a bit more personal, a bit more intimate. I 
mean, before, we were always saying, you, you, you, 
y'know, we. Now we've changed it to sort of I, me. 
Bring it down to a more personal level." 

Strength looks at the complexities of life with a 
pessimistic view, no longer fighting but 
surrendering to "this cruel world" where things are 
not so easily changed. 

"The optimism is still there, only we're taking a 
more realistic view, looking through another angle. 
To put it in these terms, on Declaration we were 
sort of looking at it through a telephoto lens and we 
were only able to see that small area, but now we've 
got a much wider angle on. We're taking in a lot 
more and using those experiences to speak from 
the heart." 

The Alarm has a simple yet strong sound. The 
rough--edged quality of its music is part of its 
appeal. Singer Mike Peters plays harmonica and 
acoustic guitar with bassist Eddie MacDonald, 
guitarist David Sharp and drummer Twist - a 
guitar band to the fore. The Alarm's songs are 
lively and uplifting. The hope is in the music itself. 
"The Day the Ravens Left the Tower" is a nice 
break with this style - a beautiful, melancholy 
ballad. 

Declaration saw the group classified as a folk, 
rock band. "I don't think we're categorized now. I 
mean, we were then obviously, because we were 

acoustic guitars a lot at that time. It seemed 
'know what I mean!" 

As for the current surge of bands bringing back 
folk,rock music, "There's definitely a genre of 
music occurring. There are a lot of bands like that 
now and whether we influenced that at all, I don't 
know," says Twist with a laugh. "It'd be nice to 
think about it." 

During its current American tour, the Alarm is 
not ignoring the protest/ march anthems from 
Declaration, despite its new style of music. 

"What we've been trying to do is make a 
mixture. Obviously, not a lot of people have heard 
the Strength album yet. It's only been released for 
about two weeks now, so what we're trying to do is 
spread it evenly, as it were. So we play about half 
and half really." 

The audience at a typical Alarm concert is not 
just teenagers,. as one might expect. "We really find 
a broad spectrum. I mean anything from quite 
young kids to adults. There are quite older people 
actually but mainly within the sort of 16 to 30 age 
bracket." 

After the United States, the Alarm does a British 
and European tour, returning to the states around 
February to tour again for about three months. 
"It's a long hard slug!" 

"Major touring and live performance is the 
essence of the Alarm anyway. It's something we 
enjoy doing and it's something we have to do 
anyway, so they both go hand in hand." 

Is touring a preference to recording? "I wouldn't 
say that. I really actually enjoy recording as well. 
It's just that when you're in one environment for 
too long a period of time, you tend to get stifled and 
you wish you'd be out doing something else .... But 
if there is a bias, I'd certainly say that touring is 
mine." 

The Alarm, originally from Wales but now 
living in London, returns to San Diego on the eve 
of Thanksgiving to headline at the California 
Theatre.

The lure of the $ea 
by arthur 8alazar 
Pity the poor pelican 
his beak can hold more 
than his belly can .. . . 
-Ogden Nash 

The pelican is a bird with a large pouch. that scoops up fish . The Rusty 
Pelican is a new restaurant where businessmen, clergy, doctors, UCSD 
provosts and other pelicans with large money pouches can scoop up 
fishes. Located on the heinously wealthy Plaza Business park, across from 
the University Towne Centre, the Pelican is this dissolute environment's 
happening place. It is an immaculate eatery that serves an excellent full-
course lunch for around $18. 

The ambience is deceptively composed in greenery, where before there 
was only a dust patch. InSide, the eminent colors are rich blues and earth-
browns. The decor caters to the capitalists who can afford to eat there. 
Wherever I looked there appeared full-breasted , All-American type 
women, the kind who speak through their noses , in terrifically skimpy 
attire. One of these ladies, Didi, became my waitress. 

What were her favorites? She liked Hawaiian Ahi, which 1 quickly 
noticed was the costliest item on the menu. For those on a budget, like me, 
the best entree is California Yellowtail, "a fish with a slightly pronounced 
flavor," she added. 

"Do you mean it's more tangy?" 1 asked. Yes, it was. 
She brought me four slices of warm sourdough bread in a basket. The 

bread was tasty and came with a tough crust. Then I was served a crab 
cocktail, finely choped and with its own little fork. Mine had a couple 
pieces of shell yet un peeled and for $4.50 I expected mas meat. My 
yellowtail came with fresh steamed vegetables and a pasta salad. It melted 
in my mouth, the trimmings well-complementing the fish. For $6.25 it 
was the best part of this endeavor. 

Capping off the flavor-fare with a special chocolate-pecan pie sounded 
like a great idea. It cost $3.45. I lost my appetite when she set the bill 
alongside my pie. This lunch, which wasn't paid for by the Guardian, cost 
me $15.90 plus a 15% tip. 

Tim Busalo, Rusty Pelican's manager, says to come despite the prices. 
"Y ou 're paying for the ultimate fresh fish. We get the catches and have 
them flown in the same day," he said. The Pelican's fishes come from 
faraway places like Alaska, Norway and the Gulf Coast. Busalo added, 
"We have dancing in a comfortable but elegant dining atmosphere." 

Nice, but too rich for my buds!

Better living through alchemy 
by daniel thoma. 

The current UCSD Drama satire could hardly do better 
Department production of than to join him there. 
Ben Jonson's The Alchemist, · Simply stated, the play tells 
directed by Walt Jones, is. a the tale of a trio of charlatans, 
wild and entertaining tour de two men and a woman, 
force that eloquently displays Subtle , Face and Dol 
the powers of first class acting, Common (oh , those old 
design and staging. . English allegorical names!). 

The text contains some of Pretending to be an alchemist 
the most difficult language and his ass.istants, they 
(and yet the most beautiful proceed to hoodwink a 
poetry) ever written for the variety of vain and greedy 
English theatre. In the face of fools, promising one man a 
this verbal challenge, the lucky spirit to win at 
players, to a man and woman, gambling, giving another the

"trippingly on the tongue," shopkeeping and marriage, 
with a grace and clarity that promoting (by unorthodox 
belies the antiquity of their and mysterious means) the 
dialogue. By their delivery cause of two puritan sisters, 
alone, one would think that and most importantly, 
this classic work is as fresh pretending ~o· create the

But, there is more beyond Epicure Mammon, who wants 
the admirable technical to use it to turn the whole 
expertise of speech. The world into gold. All of these 
actors have all built their roles idiotS pay and pay and pay for 
into living, breathing their mystical rewards (that 
characters whose various never come). 
foibles, excesses and crimes The program notes state 
are all the more believable that "as the immoral 
because of the depth and scoundrels prey upon amoral 
conviction with which they fools, the satire explodes in

character exactly like another, episodes." This is exactly 
they are all unique and what happens in the play.

Anyone who loves either they employ numerous ruses 
classic English verse or a good and comers of the set to get 

one "customer" out of the 
way while another is 
pounding at the door. The set, 
furthermore, is well cluttered 
with heaps of books and 
charts, with skulls and 
geometric figures piled on the 
shelves above. All of this 
mystical mess successfully 
shapes the environment of the 
alchemist & his partners. 
Lucie Lortie, scenic designer, 
and her construction artists 
and crew, are to be applauded 
for their good work. 

The costumes are another 
labor of love. Cathy H. 
MacFarland, designer, and the 
extensive costume corps, are 
also to be congratulated for 
their excellent work. The 
costumes are good; all are 
appropriate for [he characters 
who must work in them. They 
help the audience to 
understand, by visual clues 
alone, exactly what kinds of 
characters they are. A bad 
costume can kill an actor's 
performance, but a good 
costume lets the player's role 
shine all the more clearly. (In 
reviewing Twelfth Night last 
week, this writer neglected to 
mention the excellence of that 
show's wardrobe. It is a cliche 
that all too often costumes are 
only mentioned if the acting 
was bad. Hopefully this Hiatus 
writer can avoid that pitfall.) 

The lighting and sound 
values are also excellent. They 
flow smoothly and well 
(except for what appeared to 
be one late light cue on 
Thursday the 14th, that came 
up rather suddenly as a 
character moved toward the 
stairs). The proof of the good 
lighting and sound design is 
that generally they are not 
even noticed by the audience, 
unless they are meant to be 
noticed . A remarkabl e 
example of that kind of 
deliberately dramatic light 
and sound would be the scene 
of looking down the trap door 
into the cellar where the 
alchemist's furnace is fuming, 
which is a most effective 
moment, technically and 
dramatically. 

It is difficult to comment 
fairly on the acting, because to 
point out one person is to 
imply disapproval of all those 
others who are not 
mentioned. Jonson forbid ~ ~ that should be the purpose 

r here. In this writer's simple ], ~ opinion, the players were all 
c; superb. Yet, three certain ~

Bob's Book Report 

tThe Alche1l1ist': 
You sa\\' the play, 
noW' read the book 
by robert leone 

Kenneth Goddard, the 
forensic scientist turned 
thriller writer, has followed 
his first book, &le/ire, with 
The Alchemist, a tale of 
chemists gone wrong. This is 
one of those rare books where 
there is too much senseless 
violence. This is not a good 
book. 

This is a bad book. How 
bad is it? Well, in the cast of 
characters, we've got a UCSD 
chemistry professor who 
views organized crime as a 
convenient means of testing 
his new drugs without 
wortying 'about the FDA. 
We've got the almost 
obligatory two hotshot cops 
who met in Vietnam. We've 
got three separate batches of 
ruthless criminal figures, 
Mexican police (in a 
supporting role), inept local 
cops, hotshot lab techs who 
use gas spectrographs and .38 
specials, one or two born 
losers, three snakes (including 
one used as a murder 
weapon), on-campus (UCSD, 
for some reason, and not 
SDSU) drug dealers, a pimp 
with a thing for knives, a love-
sick grad student and drug 
labs in the desert. The 
impossibilities, the incon-
sistencies creep in and destroy 

an reality. The Alchemist is a 
hi-tech potbOiler, stemming 
from a tradition that includes 
The Enforcer, The Executioner 
and The Right Stuff. 

We've got the Mafia 
pia ying a round wi th 
computers, synthetic drugs so 
powerful that the word of 
mouth advertising affects the 
telephone company, drops 
cocaine demand by 20 
percent, start a mob war and 
so on and so forth . In other 
words, this book is 
simultaneously polemic and 
really thin (even if it 'is 405 
pages long). It's escapist 
literature, into a world where 
men are men, and the bad guys 
end up dead. At least the 
violent escapist literature is 
getting better, but there are 
several places where the 
author made bad choices in 
writing. Also, he could have 
done more research about 
l1CSD. Post office boxes in 
the Student Center, multiple 
dead bolts on a dorm room 
door and a " strictly enforced 
three hoor study periOd" 
starting at 7 pm, not to 
mention a few other howlers, 
are all signs that if Goddard 
did show up on campus, he 
didn't do much in-depth 
research.

Animal Bowl 
When the 1M football season 

staned it was assumed that the two 
best teams in intramural footban 
were Sandy's In The Hunt and the 
TKEs. Well , when they Hne it up this 
Sunday at 4:00 on Muir Field, those 
are the two teams who will square off 
for the tide of "best 1M footban team 
on campus." 

They have already played earlier 
this season, Sandy's winning 28-20, 
so the revenge factor is in favor of 
the TKEs. We can go back even 
further in this storied rivalry to 
reveal that this is reaDy a one-sided 
affair. The two teams have met 
actually three times in the past with 
Sandy's coming out on top each 
time. But don't let this fact fool you. 
Each game has been veryclose,each 
game going down to the wire. 

The talent on each team is 
incredible. If this school ever adopts 
intercoUegiate footbaD, which is a 
strong rumor on campus at this time, 
these two teams could make up a 
Slrong representative for the "Big U." 

Defending champs, Sandy's, is led 
by it's two speedy All-1M wide-outs, 
Chris Ferrez and Doug Roche. There 
hasn't been a combination mis good 
on the gridiron since Jefferson and 
Joiner. Add in the sne-aky Dan 
WaIters and speed burner Ken Shell, 
they are loaded with an offense Air 
Coryell would be envious of. 

TKE has more players on injured 
reserve than the Hidden Valley 
Convalacel1l Home. But if guts wins 
games these frat boys have a chance. 
They play hurt and they play well. 
You know the wounded animal 
theory. QB Bob Annell, the head 
dude, has the talent to carry the 
TKEs to their first ever AAA tide. 
And, their line' resembles a tidal 
wave, you JUSt can't SlOp it. 

The odds favor a IKE win. I mean 
how many times can you go to the 
well and come up empty? Maybe 
once more? 

Soul BOwl 
The Soul Bowl will be a match up 

of guys against the gals. The talented 
guys of Don's A Spaz vs, the 
superstar women of the SyntheticS. 

Don's A Spaz is basically earned 
by their men. They have the brains 
of Mike Peterson, the power of Jeff 
Iko, and the finesse of Henry Chang. 
These guys have carried this team aD 
year long. But the turning point of 
the season for them was the day that 
Mike's brother got hun for the 
umpteenth time falling over his own 
feet. You see , Mike's brother's name 
is Don, and Don's a spaz. 

The Gals in this game are the 
women of the Synthetics. These 
ladies are the equivalent of the men 
cn Don's A Spaz. They carry this 
team With their outstanding talent. 
The moSl talented of the ladies is 
their star wide receiver Shelly Lau. 
This gal leads the team in 
touchdown receptions and in 
receiving yardage. She is followed 
closely by the feasome twosome of 
Grace liao and Synthia "Synthetic" 
Wong. These three ladies can 
dominalt a game. HopefuUy for 
them they can dominate or at least 
offset the men of Don's A Spaz. 

This could be the hankSl pick of 
the weekend. I tend to lean towards 
the ladies through years of training 
so I will piclt the ladies of the 
Synthetics to cpme out on top. 

Climax Bowl 
Another one of our inter-teague 

final confrontations. These two 
teams have already met this year in a 
league game. Team Bozo had a very 
bad game and won only 20-13. Don't 
expect the same outcome this 
Sunday in the Climax Bowl. Team 
Bozo has tOO much talent to play 
another close game with the 
Desperados. 

First off they have the All-1M 
quarterback in "Dandy" Dan 
Walters. This guy can do it all. He's a 
combination of Dan Fouts and John 
Elway. He has one of the finest 
receivers in coed foothaD to throw to 
in Mary Beth Murray. No one has 
been able to keep up with her yet, 
nor will anyone on Ihe Desperados 
this Sunday. 

Dan and Mary Beth are not the 
only talented ones on the team. Take 
the threesome of Jay Kuo, Keith 
Cramer and Bill Dooley. These three 
are the beSt male defensive Rio this 
side of Busch, Municipal or Aloha 
Stadiums. LaSlly, mere is Kathy 
Walters, Dan's little sister, who 
applies all the nee~ defensive 
pressure. 

The heavy underdogs are the 
Desperados. The dictionary deftnes 
desperado as a bold, reckless 
criminal. An appropriate name for 
this group of hooligans. The only 
team who tries to intimidate their 
opponents more than the 
Desperados are the hated Oakland 
Raiders (yes, lA fans, it will alpays 
be the Oakland Raiders to this 
reponer). 

Look for a lopsided score in the 
final. The clowns will not clown 
around this time. 

It's that time of year again. Yep! It's 
eatin' and watchin' the waist time of 
year. The holidays are upon us. 

Banana Bowl 
ThiS game should be bitted as the 

men vs. the boys, the pros vs. the 
amateurs, or the Hons vs. the 
Christians. It's the very, very talented 
Thank God JR's Gone squad vs. 
some team to beat up on . The other 
day I heard the powerful Sandy's In 
The Hunt men 's AAA saying they 
were thankfut the JR"s Gone squad 
was in men's M . That's how good 
this team is. 

They are led by an unusual player 
in an unusual position. It's not very 
often in !M football that a lineman is 
the most dominating player on the 
field . Usually it is a quarterback or a 
wide receiver. But, in Paul 
Rasmussen JR's Gone has the most 
dominant player in M football . He is 
a combination of Lyle A1zado, trying 
to intimidate constandy, and Fred 
Dean with his tremendous speed 
and strength . Nobody has been able 
to stop him yet, except me yellow 
flag which he leads IMs in gening. 

The Assassins are led by the multi-
talented John Rores . This guy does 
everything but sell tickets. They also 
are one of the most dedicated 
squads in IMs. They are diligent 
practicers who think nothing 'of a 
two hour practice. They could be in 
trouble either against the Beach 
Heads or JRs Gone as their 
quanerback went down with a 
broken collarbone in their 
quarterfinal game. 

The Beach Heads win ugly. They 
reaDy don't have any offensive 
design but somehow seem to score. 
They are baSically a very good 
defensive club led by Dave 
Stanovich and Chris Stavros. They 
don't hit the home run very often but 
their pitching (defense) is superb. 
Look for them to give JR's Gone a 
game to remember. 

Cadaver Bowl 
This one features the twO best 

teams in men's A football , #1 Sneak 
It In vs. #2Joe. [('S not often that you 
get two undefeated teams into the 
Cadaver Bowl. Men's A is our biggest 
diviSIOn . It takes many trips to the 
gridiron to eam a spot in the final. 

In our tenth annual Cadaver Bowl, 
tradition seems to hold up. The one 
tradition that I know will hold up in 
the 1985 version is the typtcallack of 
offense in the Cadaver final . These 
two squads obviously didn't prep 
under laVell Edwards at BYU. They 
more likely learned their offensive 
theories from Pop Wamer the 
inventor of the sirWe wing. Both]oe 
and Sneak It In pfay what you caU 
"stone age football ." 

There is one thing these two 
teams do well, that's play defense. 
Stingy is the theme for each defense. 
Each team, believe it or not, gave up 
just one touchdown during the 
regular season. 

Look for intangibles to decide this 
one. 

Joe, orherwise known as the 
Paisley Brigade, reHes heavily on 
emotion. Led by their spiritual 
leader John Tsuji , they never are out 
of a ballgame. Rumor has it John 
bribes his players, and refs, with 
goodies from the Sundry Store. 
Sometimes it's better to be smart 
than good . They also have the All-1M 
center in Phil Noyes who is the only 
center in intramural history to call 
signals instead of the quarterback. It 
muSl say something about Joe's QB. 

Sneak 1\ In consists of a group of 
1M junkies. These guys have played 
so many sports and never taSled a 
championship that the odds give 
them the edge. Jay eadler led this 
team, sort of. He's the guy that 
scrambles around [or five minutes 
before he fmally throws the ball. 
Usually it is to a lineman who is 
exhausted from chasing around 
oying to block for him. 

Sneak It In will win 1-0 as they go 
into ovenime tied 0-0. They will gain 
one yard on the last play of the 
Califomia tie-breaker.

Here comes mixin' Dixon 
by mikel toombs 

HOLLYWOOD - Even as 
Don .Dixon is discussing his 
current musical partnership 
with singer Marti Jones over a 
lava lamp at the Holiday Inn. 
here, he can't avoid those 
three little letters. 

R .E.M. 
Dixon, of course, co-

produced (with Mitch Easter) 
the first couple of R.E .M. 
records, an association that is 
emphasized later this day 
when, after the duo performs 
a sterling acoustic set (the lava 
lamp is the major disap-
pointment) at Club Lingerie, 
the Georgians' "Can't Get 
There from Here" comes on 
over the P.A. The fact that 

Dixon didn't have anything to 
do with the particular song 
doesn't seem to matter - it's 
the thought that counts . .. . 

" I think one of the biggest 
things Mitch and I actually 
contributed to R.E .M.," 
Dixon (as he is known to 
friends) begins, "was allowing 
them to develop (their style), 
and helping them control it 
and channel it a little bit better 
and make it a little more 
palatable make it 
something that more people 
could listen to, on a slightly 
more general level- and help 
propel them in that direction; 
mainly, to take basically what 
they did and color it enough 

R.E.M., from left: Michael Stipe, Mike Mills, Bill Berry, Peter &ck 

so it wasn 't just boring, and 
just the same thing over and 
over again . 

" What ' s going on, 
particularly with Murmur, I 
think of in terms of surface 
water - which is what the 
band would be playing on 
stage - and then we have this 
real aqua fer beneath it that's 
got a lot of stuff going on, but 
it very seldom surfaces. 

"Reckoning is a little more 
direct, even though we used a 
tremendous amount of real 
sophisticated jazz-symphonic 
type miking and stuff. Some 
tracks were more successful 
than others, because these 
were still pretty cheap records 
to make and we had limited 
amounts of time because the 
band worked so much. But on 
some of the songs on 
Reckoning, if you listen to 
them real loud, we've got lots 
of binaural miking; lots of the 
background vocals, for 
example, were maybe 30 feet 
away, so that Mike Mills' 
voice is loud but it's way 
behind (Michael) Stipe's 
physically. " 

Dixon, whose only quarrel 
with R.E.M. 's Joe Boyd-
produced Fa',les of the 
Reconstruction is that the band 
didn't "stretch" itself enough, 
is noted for his work with any 
number of young East Coast 
bands. His results are 
consistently impressive, even

The Big Time 
Great Expectations , a Charles Dickens novel adapted to 

the theatre by Barbra Field opened to a packed house last 
Friday night in the Mandeville auditorium. 

Eleven consumate members of the Guthrie Theatre 
troupe pulled off a dazzling display of acting. This was 
combined with sophisticated scenery and lighting to 
produce 3 vivid portrayal of Dickens' novel. Playwright 
Field has also laced Dickens' somber novel with much 
needed humor and warmth to give polish to a well-
presented production. 

The play explores the life of Pip, played by Timothy 
Wahrer as he travels the road from a poor ignorant 

Pip plays in th~ parlour with friends Estella and Miss Ha"isham. 

orphan to a sophisticated gentleman with high hopes for 
the future . ~is rise in social status is funded by a ruffian, 
whom Pip had involuntarily aided years before. 

Pip falls in love with another orphan named Estella, 
whose benefactor is the despondent old dame Miss 
Havisham. As the play progresses, a complex web of 
intrigue leading from Miss Havisham to all the other 
characters is established. This quickly collapses and Pip's 
great expectations become only a hopeless dream. 

Great Expectatioru is both a thumbnail autobiography of 
Dickens and a social commentary of 19th century 
Victorianism in England. Estella is Dickens' real life 
mistress Ellen Ternan and Pip is a shadow of his turbulent 
life. In all, this play was well acted and definitely 
enjoyable, definitely worth seeing.

Mr. Dixon 
Continued from page 6 
though his technique is fairly 
simple (-sounding). 

"I try to keep the 
spontaneity high, but put it 
into the appropriate 
environment. Sometimes, the 
appropriate environment is 
real high-tech and real slick 
and, very often, to me the 
more exciting environment is 
a little rougher." 

Aside from R.E.M., North 
Ca rolinan Dixon has 
produced the likes of 
Swimming Pool Q's, the 
notable Fetchin Bones debut 
album and the upcoming 
Dumptruck release. A more 
personal project is Marti 
Jones' Unsophisticated Time, 
an album on which Dixon 
played most of the instru-
ments and wrote many of the 

songs. Continuing the one-
man/one-woman approach 
are Dixon and Jones' L.A. 
appearances. 

"We did the group for a 
couple weeks on the East 
Coast," says Dixon, "and it 
was pretty good but it's 
expensive and we felt like we 
didn't have any money and 
time to develop the group 
enough, to introduce Marti in 
the absolute best light. 

"We were so careful in 
making sure that it was songs 
we were dealing with, instead 
of purely arrangements -
because Michael Oackson) 
would have a tough time 
doing Thriller' on acoustic 
guitar. All the songs we have 
are really songs." 

A major strength of 
Unsophisticated Time is such 
real songs as "Lonely Is (As 
Lonely Does)," "(If! Could) 
Walk Away" and "Follow 
You All Over the W orId." 
Dixon, who sings a ouple of 

Charlotte's Fetchin Bona - Danna PenkS, Hope Nicholls, Aron Pitkin, 
Gary White, Mmc Mweller -haw cUbwted with a rase, 'Cabin Flounder' 

his own songs in concert (and 
Jones adds schmaltz-defying 
versions of "To Sir With 
Love" and Donovan's 
"Lalena"), thinks the time is 
ready for the duo's music. 

"I think we're entering a 
period here where people 
seem to be a little more 
receptive to being eclectic. 

We're getting back into one of 
these slightly more 'listening' 
eras, which is good 
particularly for songwriters as 
opposed to producers and 
engineers and the idea of the 
sound being the song, rather 
than the melody and the 
singer and the words being the 
song." 

Better play 
Continued from page 3 
moments of the work are so 
amazing that they must be 
pointed out. 

Epicure Mammon's 
daydream speeches of how he 
will live, breathe and eat, once 
he has obtained the 
philosopher's stone, and his 
almost sexual description of 
what utensils he will use at 
table, are some of the most 
luscious monologue lines ever 
written. Their raptured 
delivery, in full character, by 
actor D.B.Novak, makes the 
audience squirm with laughter 
and delight at the sheer 
extravagance of Mammon's 
sensuous and sensual desire. 

Secondly, there is the 
moment when Subtle, the 
fake alchemist, played by 
Johnathan Fried, dramatically

the cellar, and converses with 
the marvelously disembodied 
voice of his "assistant", Face 
(David Turrentine), while 
Mammon looks on in wonder 
at the fumes boiling up from 
the alchemist's furnace, 
below. The dialogue is a 
wonderful gobbledygook 
about oil of Mercury and who 
knows what alchemical 
garbage. It is played with 
delightful mock seriousness 
(to impress Mammon). From 
the playing between these 
three actors, one really gets 
the feeling of how stupid 
alchemy is, physically, and yet 
what a power it holds over the 
minds of men (a psychological 
and mythological strength 
about which Carl Jung has 
written so much). 

Lastly, there is a moment in 
the third act when Dol 
Common, played by Leah 
Maddrie, "goes mad" and 
runs about the stage reciting 
lines from Hamlet. Any lover 
of Shakespeare cannot help 
but be enamoured as she takes 
the alchemist's skull from the 
shelf and spouts to it, "Alas, 
poor Yorick, I knew him, 
Horatio ... here hung these 
lips that oft I kissed." Then, 
grabbing up some dried 
flowers, she launches into 
Ophelia's mad scene, "Here's 
rosemary ... " etcetera. One 
has to be there to appreciate 
the effect that Leah's 
remarkable, satirical delivery 
has on Mammon and on the 
audience. 

Congratulations to all 
concerned and involved with 
this remarkable production, 
and an earnest round of 
applause for the work of its 
director, Walt Jones. 

The Alchemist will continue 
tonight through Saturday at 
the Mandel Weiss Center.
