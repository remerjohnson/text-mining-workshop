Mehan 
Awarded 
Tenure 
Saltman Goes 
Against Dept. 

By Doug Campion 
Bud Mehan, assistant 

professor of Sociology and 
director of the Teas;her 
Education Program, will be 
awarded tenure despite a 
negative recommendation from 
the Sociology department. 

Mehan said that he received 
notification of the decision 
Monday from Sociology 
Department Chairman Dr. 
Bennett Berger after about two 
years of confidential 
proceedings. The review 
'process requires that opinions 
and recommendations be sent 
to Vice Chancellor of Academic 
Affairs Paul Saltman from the 
Sociology department, the 
Provost's Office at Third 
College (Mehan's college), the 
Office of Graduate Studies and 
Research and the Committee on 
Academic Personnel (CAP). 
Once Saltman' approves a 
professor for tenure, Chancellor 
William McElroy must also 
approve. According to Mehan, 
Berger read him a letter over the 
telephone, informing him that 
he was to be awarded tenure. 

Berger could not comment on 
the matter saying, "The case is 
not concluded yet." He added, 
"These processes are supposed 
to be confidential until the final 
decision comes down." 

Berger has received a letter 
from Saltman and sources say 
the Idter probably requests a 
response to Saltman's decision 
to go againsl the departmental 
recommendation of no tenure. 

Salt man would not comment 
on the potential outcome of the 
proceedings beca use " final 
action has not been taken and in 
that sense it's a file which has 
not been completed. " 

However , he did say that the 
issue "is in review at the 
department level again." He 
added , "We usually give the 
department a finite amount of 
time to respond ," but he could 
not recall the deadline for the 
response. 

"My department is fairly 
upset about this," said Mehan in 
reference to the overruling of 
the Sociology department's 
recommendation. 

According to Mehan the 
controversy over his receiving 
tenure arose within the 
Sociology department. "I don 't 
think there was a single main 
issue," he said. " I've been

Rec Center Gets 
Voter Approval 

But Voter Turnout Kills Proposal 
By Eric Jaye 

Editor 
Though nearly 80 percent of those voting approved the 

proposed recreation facilities proposal yesterday and Wednesday, 
the plan will not be forwarded to the UC Regents due to 
"insufficient" voter turnout. 

Only 12.5 percent of UCSO's graduate and undergraduate 
population voted in the referendum, short or ihe 25 percent turnout 
required by Chancellor William McElroy to legitimize the vote, 
"ccording to Election Marshal Kenzie Nicoll. 
The plan would have raised student fees by $5 per quarter to build 
and maintain student recreation facilities. 

If the plan had been approved, over a million dollars would have 
leen spend to build a new swimming pool, racquetball courts, two 
acuzzies and night lighting on the Muir field. 

"A great victory for good sense," is how Mike Elcan who 
IUpported the proposal and who serves as the Student Council 

~epresentative to the Student Recreation Facilities Committee 
Jescribed the vote. 

Elcan said the high approval percentage shows that students 
Inderstand that the proposal was "well thought out and in the best 
nterest of the students." 

Elcan attributed the low turnout to the tenth week referendum 
Jate which he called a "horrible time to take a vote" because of 
Jpcoming finals . 

AS Commissioner of Student Welfare Jon Bekken, who served 
Xl a group opposing the proposal, also expressed pleasure at the 
'eferendum results, though ,he indicated that his group might be 
willing to support a revised recreation facilities proposal next-year. 

Students voting in Rec Center referendum yelterday. Bekken said he would like to see certain aspects of the facilities financing, which he calls insufficient, worked out before he would 
support it.

North City West Development 
Outgoing Registration Fee 

Chairman Nicoll called the 
results a "very positive non-
binding opinion poll." 

By John Hondros 
Associate News Editor 

UCSD students have joined 
the ranks of community 
protesters against the 
development of North City 
West. 

The Student Coalition for 
Responsible Planning, which 
evolved from the Contemporary 
Issues' Wilderness c lass , 
formed with the intention of 
doing an objective analysis of 
the planned com munity . 
However, the coalition 's goals 
shifted "once we got more 
involved and found out what's 
going on," said Mitch Keeler, 
one of the 12 members of the 
coalition. 

A recent independent survey 
indicates that 67 percent of San 
Diego residents polled oppose 
North City West. "The 
community, as a whole , knows 
North City West will be 
detrimental to San Diego," said 
Keeler. 

If developed , the community 
of 40,000 - more than the 
total populations of Del Mar, 
Leucadia, Cardiff and Encinitas 
combined - will "affect most of 
the UCSD students, especially 
those living in the area," 
according to Keeler. 

Andy Caffrey, president of 
the coalition, is concerned that 
students won't be able to afford 
the housing. The minimum 
price for a house in North City 
West will be $175,000, and 
$95,000 for a condominium, 
Caffrey daims. 

"North City Welt will 

definitely not provide housing 
for students. No one will benefit 
from the development except 
for those who inherit $1 million 
from their grandparents," 
remarked Caffrey. 

Caffrey believes that North 
City West will create traffic 
problems for students who use 
Interstate 5 to get to and 
from campus. "The Environ-
mental Impact Report for North 
City West shows that there will 
be two hours of traffic jams 
durin g the morning and 
afternoon on 1-5 every day," he 
said. 

According to the EIR, the 

project will also increase traffic 
on Carmel Valley Road , 
creating pressure to widen the 
two· lane road to four lanes. If 
widening is necessary along 
Carmel Valley Road west of 1-5, 
the impact on the area's lagoon 
will be significant, the report 
claims, "since this biological 
habitat is already under severe ' 
pressure from development in 
the area." 

The aesthetics of North City 
West is another concern of the 
coali tion . "We're worried about 
the fact that San Oiego is 
quickly becoming another LA," 

(Please tum to page 14) 

Nicoll said that in this 
"Proposition 13 era" projects 
like the recreation facilities will 
no longer be paid for with state 
funds. 

Elcan said the recreation 
facilities committee will now 
"probably" ask the Registration 
Fee Committee to fund lighting 
of the Muir fi eld. 

Th Recreation Facilities 
Committee will also seek 
outside f1mding to defer rising 
construction costs so the $5 
figure wi ll not have to be 
in reased on a referendum 
question next year, Elcan said. 

Baraka, Evolving Poet, Talks 
Of Black L·iterature, History 

By Ted Burke 
and Steve Roberts 

"People and their life are always the primary 
principle," said poet, playwright, social activist 
Amiri Baraka, speaking about black art to a 
combined audience of a drama writing cla s 
and a music class last Tuesday in a room in the 
Mandeville Center. Baraka began his talk by 
asserting that a people 's art was something that 
came from their own experiment. 

"The art comes as a result of the people and 
not the other way around," he continued , "The 
music and the literature come as a result of the 
people's lives." 

Baraka, who changed his name from Le Roi 
Jones in the late Sixties, was one of the seminal 
figures in the Beat poetry movement of the late 
Fifties and early Sixties. His development as an 
artist hal taken from bohemianism, avid black 

nationalism, to a determinedly Marxist-Leninist 
stance. 

Although Baraka' political attitudes are 
plainly visible in his works, he remains an artist 
nonetheless who's powers to translate ideas 
into imagery has resulted in several brilliant 
works, which include poetry collections 
(Preface to a Twenty Volwne Suicide Note, 
and Black Magic Poetry), plays (The Toilet, 
The Slave, and S-l), a novel (The SYltem of 
Dante's Hell), and two books about mu ie, 
(Blues People and Black MUlic). 

To illustrate his point about art stemming 
from a people's lives and experience, Baraka 
pointed out that the laves brought from Africa 
were people forcibly gathered from aU over the 
continent. The captive Africans were people 
with different languages, different cultures. who

Letters to the Editor 

UCSD is Still a Feudal State 
Editor: 

We can thank John Taylor 
(eratwhile editor of the Triton 
Times, and now contributor to 
the first T uesda y edition of IT's 
prodigious offspring) for 
shedding much needed light on 
the feudal character of this 
institution. 

The recent Academic Senate 
censure of the Chancellor can in 
no way be compared to a 
parliamentary vote of "no 
confidence," Taylor advises. 
Becau e the 805 members of 
the academic senate have no 
power to determine how or by 
whom this university should be

run. And that is as it should be , 
he points out, since (Nobel 
laureates to the contrary 
notwithstanding) these men and 
women are" coUectively dumb." 

Taylor erred slightly, 
however, in contending tha t the 
UC President answers to 
Sacramento and the taxpayers. 
This would mean that these 
august adminis trators would be 
accountable to the people of this 
sta te, many of whom are 
employed, to borrow a phrase, 
as " Iine·item groundskeepers." 
The obvious lack of property 
was fortunately foreseen by our 
administrative elite who made 
clear (Article IX, State 
Constitution) that they would 
answer to no one. 

. That is why these barons of 
academia are so apolitical and 
so free. Free to develop H. 
bombs, neutron bombs. cruise 
missiles; free to invest in 
apartheid; free to recruit for the 
Central Intelligence A gency 
(and the Navy and the Marine 
Corps and ... ); free to di ~miss 
unSavory elements from their 
faculty . In thi s con tex t. Taylor's 
disdain for the Academic 
Senate's acti on ("The whole 
thing drips 01 politics") is readily 
understandable.

it up best in the commentary's

UCSD, Hospitals 
Face Unionizations 

Inexperienced Administrators Face 
Increasingly Activist Workers 

. By Marlc Stadler 

U nionization fever has struck La Jolla in unexpected places thi. year. Scripps Memorial Hospital, Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation and even UCSD are al1)ong the new 
hotbeds of labor activism in the area. Nurses~ Service workers arid 
public employees are in the vanguard of this movement. For 
instance: 

-Registered nurses at Scripps Memorial Hospitals early this 
year voted by a large margin to join the Califomia Nurses Assn. 
(CNA). The vote has caused no small amount of consternation 

Mark Stadler graduated from UCSD in 1978 after serving as 
managing editor of the Triton Times. He now works for the La 
lolla Light, where he has been covering local unionization efforts . 
among top administrators there. 

-Last month a small group of nurses at the staid and 
respectable Scripps Clinic Green Hospital tried to become the 
second local hospital to join CNA, but were soundly rebuffed. 

-Service workers at Scripps Memorial Hospitals tried to 
organize - this time, in a coalition of four AFL-CIO unions - but 
also lost th~ vote . The unions are now in the process of filing unfair 
labor pracbce charges against the hospiials with the National Labor 
Relations Board. 

-=- \yorkers at UCSD and other state institutions are looking with 
glee toward July ], when collective bargaining goes into effect for 
public employees. Officials with the American Federation of State 
County and Municipal Employees, active at UCSD for some tim~ 
now, are making plans to hold certification elections as soon after 
July] as possible. 

The really interesting thing abQutthis flurry of union activity is 
not that employees at these former bastions 01 anti·unionism want 
to be represented . 'f1ley would be foolish not to seek unionization 
in light of the lucrative contracts and benefits organized employees 
generally receive. 

What bears watching is how the administrators at these 
institutions - UCSD, Scripps Clinic a nd the like - react to 
unionization attempts. 

To begin with, most loca l administrators are novices a t the 
unionization game. Private institutions like the hospitals have long 
held a kind of immunity from unionization, especially in anti·union 
Southern California. In interviews, many of them profess ignorance 
of the complex certification process. 

And officials at state organizations like UCSD have never had to 
deal with the problems inherent in collective bargaining because 
unionization has been megal for public employees until now. 

So how have administrators reacted to unionization attempts? In 
varying ways, naturally, reflecting their own personalities and the 
temperaments of their institutions. 

At Scripps Memorial Hospitals, for instance, the administrators 
seemed to have panicked in the face of nurses and service workers 
wanting to organize. 

They cut off all communication on the maller with the media -
and thus the outside world - at the behest of their legal staff . They 
hired a Los Angeles.based labor relations firm, West Coast 
Industrial Relations Assn. , which has a bad reputation among 
union organizers. They started an intensive anti·union campaign 
among their nurses. 

They lost the election. Nurses voted overwhelmingly in favor of 
joining the California Nurses Assn . and instituting collective 
bargaining procedures . 

The nursl's mi!lht have voted to unionize pven without the 
(please turn to page 14) 

If Taylor doesn't see why 
faculty and staff want child 
care, then he doesn't 
understand why it ' s an 
affirmative action issue. Good, 
affordable child care could help 
women gain job access· equal to 
that of males. Despite the fact 
that we might all agree that both 
parents should bear responsi. 
bility for childrearing, such 
duties usually revert to the 
female . This is a social problem, 
in need of a social solution -
hence the need for child care. 

It has been somewhat 
interesting to watch William 
McElroy and Paul Saltman 
fight over the job of 
administering defense 
contracts. It's been a thrill 
watching Paul "I'd rather 
discuss amino acids" Saltman 
reach new heights of self· 
servitude. And, of course, it's 
been a novel experience to see 
the Academic Senate struggle 
for ~emocracy, so to speak. 

But don't forget these are the 
same folks who autocratically 
denied the possibility of honors 
to all but a small percentage of 
students. And where were these 
worthies when the Chancellor 
roughed up the daycare center, 
when he tried to set the faculty

AUSCHWITZ, Poland (AP) - Pope John Paul 
II cdebrated Mass yesterday amid the ruins of Hitler's 
most infamous death camp and appea led for peace 
and justice in the name of all nation s whose rights were 
violated. 

Speaking from a wooden railroad platform from 
which millions were herded to their deaths , the pontiff 
drew his greatest applause when he quoted his 
predecessor , Pope Paul VI: " No more war, only 
peace!" 

A hugE! crowd of several hundred thousand stood

Europe Votes 
BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Europeans began 

voting yesterday in the world 's first multinational 
election , choosing a continental Parliament many 
have dreamed of for years as a first step toward a 
United States of Europe. 

The voting was light, apparently because of apathy 
and ignorance of the issues involved . 

Violence struck on the first of three days of balloting 
when terrorists lobbed a hand grenade into a school 
being used as a polling place in Belfast , Northern 
Ireland. Police said the attackers raked the building 
with gunfire, but there were no injuries.

WASHINGTON (AP) - President Carter has 
decided to move into full -scale development of a huge 
new. mobile mis sle designed to foil any Soviet surprise 
attack on the US la nd·based striking force in the 
1980s a nd beyone , administration officials said last 
night. 

The plan calls for mounting 200 missles, each with 
10 powerful nuclear warheads, on some form of rail 
system that would shuttle them among some 8,000 to 
9 ,000 " hardened" launch shelters so the Russians 
would be unable to knock them out in a first strike . 

Registration Backed 
WASHINGTON (AP)-A bill that would renew 

military draft registration for a ll men aged ] 8 through 
26 was approved yesterday by a Senate 
subcommittee. The issue might reach the Senate floor 
for debate next week . 

The measure , passed on a 4-3 vote in a closed 
meeting or the Senate Armed Services manpower 
subcommittee, was the first action in the Senate this 
year on the politically controversial subject of the draft 
which was abandoned in early] 973 at the end of US 
involvement in the Vietnam War. A draft registration

US Keeps Sanctions 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Presidenl Carter said 

yesterday he will retain economic sanctions against

Termed 'Fair to Owners' 

Initiative Would Stop Rent Gouging 
By Sam Gooch 

Staff Writ. 
Students may benefit from 

alate-wide efforts to place a rent 
stabilization initiative on the 
July 1980 .tate ballot which 
would prevent rent gouging by 
property owners. 

The Golden State Mobile 
Home Owner. League 
(GSMHOL), with almost 
200,000 members throughout 
California, officially launched 
ita signature gathering 
campaign in late April. The 

league expects to obtain 
500,000 signatures by the 
September deadline to allure 
the needed 346,119 valid 
signatures, according to Bob 
NcNaul, GSMHOL's San 
Di(!8o-based associate director. 

The proposed initiative would 
prevent rent increase abuses by 
setting control guidelines for a 
4·year period beginning July 1, 
1980. The guidelines would 
establish a base rent period 
retroactive to April I, 1979, 
and allow landlords three 

options by which to raise rents: 
(1) By one·haJf the rise in the 

Consumer Price Index for that 
year. 

(2) By itemizing expenses 
and increasing rents to cover 
additional costs of maintaining

Actually, White's musical

through MIT's graduate

while transcribing the trumpet

funny - it made it sound as if

Graduation Can Be Step Or Leap 

By Heatherbell Fong 
Staff Writer 

Whether graduation is an 
end, a means to an end, a 
turning point, or a matter of little 
moment depends on the 
individual point of view. 
What one gets out of attending 
UCSD is not so much what one 
puts into it, but what one 
expects to ge t out of it. 

For Jack Grobstein, a UCSD 
History major, class of '76, 
graduation furnished "evidence 
that the individual can 
accomplish something." UCSD 
was important for Grobstein. 
"Going there was a choice that 
changed my life for the better, 
he says . " I would do it again. " 

It was at UCSD that 
Grobstein discovered in himself 
the creativity that is essential to 
his present position as editor 
and co.founder of a magazine 
called Vision the Sophi.ticate 
(Viaion until recently). The 
magazine has a growing local

and international reputation, he 
said. 

But at graduation, Grobstein 
had no idea that he would be 
involved in such a project. He 
spoke of the "sheltered" life of a 
coUege student, saying that 
when he was at UCSD he 
though the most important thing 
that could happen was "what 
the Chancellor was doing." In 
the " real world ," said Grobstein , 
"it is surprising how insignificant 
those things become." 

Graduating in the same year 
as Grobstein , Otis Watson 
provides an interesting contrast. 
The self-realization tha t came to 
the undergra duate Grobstein 
seems to have been a mark of 
Watson in high school. It was 
there that , finding himself 
"involved in public speaking," 
he decided to "use that talent" in 
pursuing a legal career. 

Watson's years at UCSD 
were " rewarding," he said. 
They confirmed him in the 

course he had sketched out for 
himself. H e approached 
graduation with the attitude tha t 
it was "time to move on -
better myself." He had a lready 
been accepted into law school. 

That summer of '76 was like 
any other summer for Watson. 
He went to work at Crocker 
Bank, as he had been doing 
every summer since he was a 
junior in high chool. In the fall 
he entered Western State 
University College of Law. 

Watson said he "knew law 
school would be rigorous," but 
was nevertheles s unprepared 
for an experience that was "like 
going through kindergarten 
again." In this "brand new and 
very competitive" milieu 
Watson has already dis · 
tinguished himself, as he is 
president of the California State 
Student Bar Association this 
year.

good time" was the aim of

Philosophy maior Jim Pokomy 
while at UCSD. Pokorny 
remembers having "no strong 
feelings" that he should "tackle 
the world," or "make a million." 
No major turning point occurred 
in his undenlTaduate years, and 
he attended graduation (which 
he postponed because of the 
draft: it was 1970), with the 
idea of going on having a good 
time. 

Pokorny worked for a while 
in a restaurant in North County 
and spent a lot of time on the 
beach . Not worrying about the 
future , not even looking ahead, 
he hit ch-hiked across the 
country and ended up in the 
Bahamas. For two years he was 
"uncommitted" to any other 
way of life. 

" It would be difficult to 
recreate that now ," said 
Pokorny recently from his San 
Diego law office. He said that 
his career, his age, and the 
mood of the times" have 

changed him. 
Pokorny shares his law office 

with Sam Khouri, his "old 
roommate from UCSD who 
funnelled himself right into a 
legal career." It was Pokorny's 
opinion that, in comparison to 
himself, Khouri "feels he missed 
out." 

Khouri, however, remarked 
that although " there was 
nothing wrong" with Jim's past , 
" I don't regret what I did either." 

Khouri remembers UCSD as 
"a pretty place." He said he was 
"sad" to leave, but having 
decided in his sophomore year 
to apply to law school , he was 
set to attend Hastings in 
northern California by the time 
he graduated . 

Khouri , an economics major, 
was given the distinction at 
graduation that he "cooked one 
hell of a hamburger." He had

Grads Can Expect Good Job Market 
By John Hondrol 

A_i.te News Editor 
Job prospects are good for 

the Class of '79, as the number 
of offers nationwide are up 35 
percent over last year, 
according to a survey laken by 
the CoUege Placement Council. 

The survey shows that the 
technical majors, such as 
engineering and the physical 
sciences, account for 60 percent 
of all job offers. while there has 
been nine percent decline in 
offers for the humanities and 
social scie,!ce majors. 

"There are a lot of good jobs 
in engineering and computer 
science available in San Diego," 
said Gloria Liebrenz, manager 
of the UCSD Career Planning 
and Placement Office. Most 
engineering jobs have a starting 
salary of $15,000 a year for 
those with bachelor degrees, she 
added . 

Liebrenz said about one· half 
of the UCSD students enter the 
labor market upon completing 
the undergraduate level. "Most 
of the engineering students 
choose to go to work over 
continuing school at the 
graduate level," she said. 

Liebrenz emphasized that 
students should include classes 
in accounting, computer science 
and statistics in their academic 
programs. "This is what most 
employers are looking for; no 
students should graduate 
without taking these classes. " 
Knowing the " basics" of these 
classes will suffice for most jobs, 
she added. 

Despite the nationwide 

Placement Council statistics, 
Liebrenz said that this year 
more companies have visited 
UCSD to interview humanities 
and social science students than 
ever before. "We anticipate (at 
the CPP office) that job 
opportunities for our humanities 
and social science majors have 
increased since last year," she 
said. 

"Those (humanities and 
social science) students who 
take advantage of the various 
employment contacts we have 
at the Career Placement Office 
will be able to get the job 
offers," commented Liebrenz. 
"For those who have not yet 
started to search for jobs, the 
labor market will not be as 
kind ." 

According to Lebrenz, the 
major emploYment firms with 
management training programs 
usually go through the CPP 
office when seeking employees. 
"If students aren't included in 
the on-campus interviews, they 
don't exist to the employer and 
can't be considered for a slot." 

Liebrenz commented that the 
"strong quantitative emphasis" 
in the Economics department at 
UCSD is "what the businesses 
are looking for . These 
quantitative skills are very 
salable." 

For those humanities and 
social science students worried 
about the " quantitative 
requirements," Liebr e nz 
advised: " Hang in there, 
because it pays off after 

Pugwash to Meet Here 
Ethical questions in science will be explored in depth at the 

Pugwash Conference, to be held at UCSD from June 1210 June 
26. 

The event will be comprised of addresses and lectures by 
nationally and internationally known scholars and 
policymakers , various films with guaranteed seating, and four 
"plenary sessions." 

Daniel Ellsberg, Joel Premack, Theodore Friedman, and 
Jonas Salk are among the list of speakers. A $50 fee is required 
for attendence at the conference for a total of two credits. 

A two·session class being offered by both the Political Science 
and University Extension Department is "a preview and a way to 
participate in the conference," according to Ronald Bee, 
assistant director of political services department. 

It will be held on June 12 and June 28 in University Extension 
Room 2 from 7 pm to 10 pm. Jeff Leifer and Eric Markusan are 
the instructors. 

For additional information on signing up for the class and 
conference, please contact Cecilia Solis at the University 
Extension Office. The telephone number is 452·3411.

Last year, 64 percent of the 

UCSD students who applied 10 
medical school were accepted. 
The CPP office works also to 
provide career alternatives for 
students interested in the health 
sciences, but who are not 
destined to be traditional MDs. 

"There has been a upsurge in 
student interest in health 
administration," said Liebrenz. 
However , these administrative 
positions are not only limited to 
Biology majors. "A lot of 
employers don't care about the 
major; they are more concemed 
about the skills, " she said. 

Liebrenz said that 15 years 
ago she believed the field of 
Oceanography had the best 
potential for growth. This has 

not proven true, she continued. 
Instead, she sees the most 
potential in the fields of health 
care and energy. 

"There will be a growth in the 
field of health care delivery; this 
will be mandated by the 
formation of a national health 
program," she said. 

"As we continue to develop 
new kinds of energy, there will 
be a need for people with a 
background in politics to 
implement this technology," she 
said. 

Liebrenz believes that 
students majoring in language 
are "committing employment 
suici de . " However , she 
cont inued, "to be bilingual is to 
be put at the top of the 
employment li st."

IOphomore years, the 6 '4", 
loo.pound outfielder sat out his 
third year of eligibility. 
Dickinson decided to give it a 
final try in his senior year under 
new head coach Vince Askey. 
He made the team, earning a 
starting spot in the outfield. 

"Jon's desire, dedication and 
hard work finall y paid off," said 
Askey. "He has proven that one 
can excel and lead in athletic 
competition without having the 
greatest natural gifts."

DickinlOn was the "clutch" 
performer during the team's 14. 
25 season. "Jon always got the 
hit when it was needed the 
mOlt," Askey remarked. "He 
was the guy that everyone 
wanted to see in the clutch 
situations." DickinlOn was 
credited with wiMing several 
'games with pressure RBI 
singles. 

Dickinson was a key, both 
offensively and defensively in 
the Tritons' second best season 
ever. With a .380 batting 
average , the outfielder 
established the highest average 
in UCSD baseball history, 

smashing 41 hits and 23 RBI's. 
For the month of April he batted 
.500. 

DickinlOn, a Third College 
Biology major, demonstrated 
his leadership abilities 
throughout the sealOn. "Jon 
tried to help the team in any way 
he could, from throwing extra 
batting practice to offering good 
suggestions to me," praised 
Askey. 

DickinlOn has'been described 
as a "total team player" by his 
coach. U Jon's philolOphy was to 
excel on the individual level and 
win at all costs for the team, said 
Askey. Dickinson received

intends to work as a lab 
assistant on campus this 
summer, and possibly play

Van Gundy's first year 

cycling endeavors at UCSD 
were very successful. In April , 
the Warren College junior won 
two races and placed second in 
the prestigious NCAA Western 
United States Intercollegiate 
Championships. She won both

the Claremont and UC Santa 
Barbara Criteriums. She added 
another lirst place victory in 
May with a win at Dominguez 
Hats. 

The . 22·year·old chemistry 
major ended up as the only 
female cy.c1ist on this year's 
team. "Cycling is a lough sport 
for women," said cycling coach 
Dean Patterson. "No other 
UCSD women lasted the entire 

" season . 
"Some other girls started 

oul," Van Gundy added, "but I 
don't know what happened to 
them. I guess they just didn't like 
it. You have to be sort of weird ." 

For practice, Van Gundy 
rides with the other members of 
the team besides cycling back 
and forth to UCSD from her 
home in Cardiff. The cyclist 
feels that the men have helped 
her improve. 

"In cycling, men are much 
better than women. The guys 
would take time out from their 
rides and help me work out." 

"Susan is a very coachable 
athlete, with an excellent 
atti tude," Patterson remarked. 
"She'll do whatever I suggest in 
critical race situations." Van 
Gundy began this season as a 
novice rider and has gradually 
improved . 

She came to San Diego from 
Riverside where she attended 
Riverside City CoUege, playing 
number one doubles and 
number two singles.

UCSD May Control Telescope 'In Space 
By Eric Harpell 
Science Editor 

resolving power of the Mount 
Palomar telescope, currently 
the most powerful telescope in 
the United States. 

Talks among University of 
California astronomers about 
the possibilities of a UC campus 
obtaining the center began in 
1977, when the National 

Academy of Sciences 
recommended that the 
telescope be linked to a "science 
institute," at the ground·based 
control point. 

A tOO-inch reflecting 
ieleacope to be placed in orbit 
around the Earth in 1983 may 
have its control center at 
UCSD. 

Although the location of the 
control center for the Large 
Space T descope (LST) hal not 
yet been decided, the UCSD aite 
hal an excellent chance of being 
adected by officials from the 
National Aeronautic. and 
Space Administration (NASA), 
according to Or. Margaret 
Burbidge, UCSD profe.sor of 
Astronomy and Astrophysics 
and former director of 
England's Royal Observatory. 

Burbidge said the control 
center will be a mecca for 
scientist. from allover the 
world. The La Jolla sile appeals 
to NASA official. because 
"visiting scientists like to come 
here," said Burbidge. 

By locating the 1ST outside 
the Earth 's . atmosphere, 
scientists will get a "new view of 
the Universe ," Burbidlle said. 

Surface features of the outer 
planets--Uranus, Neptune, and 
Pluto··w ill be visible to 
astronomers for the first time, 
while very distant objects, such 
as Quasars and Pulsars, will 
reveal properties formerly 
obscured from scientists by the. 
Earth'. atmosphere, she said. 

may have an opportunity to be 
direc tly involved with the 
control center. " Adjunc t 
positions are being discussed for 
scientists, " said Burbidge , 
whereby "many of them would 
be allowed to maintain staffs of 
graduate students." . 

Burbidge also mentioned that 
UCSD seniors and juniors will . 
have an opportunity to do 
research with the LST. 

Lumumba and Zapata Are 
Worthy of College Naming 
(Continued from pale 2) would merit operating in their 
were democratic revolu. names. 

The lO-ton LST, already 
IDler construction, will have 
better l'UOIution than any other 
telescope, .aid Burbidge. She 
expects the orbiting telescope to 

~ve 20 to 30 times the 

The LSTs orbit, 310 m~es 
above the Earth's surface, will 
be far enough from the 
atmosphere's obscuring 
properties to allow astronomers 
to view the universe in the 
ultraviolet spectrum, she said. 
Ultraviolet light is usuall1 
absorbed by the Earth s 
atmosphere, preventing 
scientists from analyzing the 
complete spectrum of stellar 
objects. "It wiD be like viewing 
the universe a new color," she 
added. 

UCSD faculty and students 

The space shuttle, currently 
being tested by NASA , will 
carry the LST into space. The 
Goddard research center in 
Florida , which will be 
responsible for launching and 
maintaining the LST in orbit, 
will assist the proposed LST 
Control Center in monitoring 
T elemelry from the telescope. 

Representatives from the UC 
campuses al Berkeley, Los 
Angeles , Santa Cruz, and San 
Diego met at UCLA early last 
year to discuss possible 
locations from the control 
center. "At the UCLA meeting, 
the participants decided on La 
JoDa as the best site," said 
Burbidge. 

WE ARE 

San Diego's 

tionaries. Both fought the ruling 
class. Both were assassinated 
by reactionary forces . Had 
these persons lived, and had 
their programs been imple. 
mented , their respecti ve 
countries (Zaire and Mexico) 
would be in better shape today 
- less impoverished, less 
dependent on U.S. capital. 

If Third CoDege "officials" 
took the trouble to study history 
and explain it to prospective 
applicants and their parents, 
perhaps Lumumba and Zapata 
would be thought of favorably, 
as are the justifiably admired 
Douglass, Drew and King. 

At the very least, Lumumba 
and Zapata merit this honor 
more than our administrators

through the institution of 
American slavery, were 
systematically stripped of their 
own culture. 

Baraka (Le Roi Jones) Speaks On His style 01 reading adds 
"meat" to his rather outspoken 
political views , which enter his 
poems in the form of direct 
statements and surrealistic 
images, depicting his extreme 
distaste for capitalism. 

Art~s Roots in Black Experience 
"The question of the what is 

Afro·Americanism as opposed 
to the African thing, is a whole 
new cultural development. 

" When Afro ·Americanism 
developed, it was a 
new culture, the result of many 
different African nationalities 
coming together forcibly under 
the circumstances of slavery, 
developing a culture in English , 
and influenced by Christianity ." 

Baraka further pointed out 
that what did survive from the 
original African cultures were 

the I?ractical elements. "They 
let us have the work song, 
because thai was what slaves 
were brought here lor, and they 
let us have the spiritual because 
they (the slave owners) thought 
the church was a method of 
social control... Except that got 
turned around too . They star ted 
to organize the churches . 

" It was the only place in the 
community where black people 
could meet and organize. Nat 
Turner was a preacher. 

"A lot of the early black 
nationalist militants wer e 
ministers. The church was a 
very st rong institution in the 
black community, and it had a 
lot to do with any art that was 
created, and it still does . The 
whole 'soul' phenomena was 
basica lly the introduction of 
strong church elements into the 
blues . If you look at 
AfroAmerican literature as a 
genre, as a whole body of work, 
you'll find a very functional 
literature that is actually spoken 
in churches, whether they're 
sermons, I speeches exhorting 
people against slavery, or the 
slave narratives." 

Going on, Baraka insisted 
that black music reflects the 
changing experience of black 
people in America . 

" Afro·American music is a 
reflection of what the people 
themselves are . It 's gone 
through gr,eat changes because 

those changes reflect the 
changes of the people. The 
movement from work songs and 
spirituals to blues signifies a 
change in the whole of social 
relationships among black 
people themselves . When they 
talk about ' .. . the blues came up 
the river,' the blues didn't come 
up the river by itself. The people 
ca me up the river, and the music 
followed them. 

Amiri Baraka 

"Earlier, when the musIc 
ca me to New Orleans, it was 
because New Orleans was tHe 
largest city in the black belt in 
the south. This was the most 
sophisticated development of 
the music in that particular 
place. Hence, New Orleans, 
where' they can take the 
spiritual, the African rhythms, 
the old hollers , the blues and put 

them together with European 
instruments, was the place 
where they created a music that 
was on a higher technological 
level because it now made use of 
mor e varied harmoni c 
framework. The music 'came 
up the river" because Black 
people themselves migrated to 
the North. " 

Later on, Baraka spoke of 
the discrimination in most 

literature anthologies that are 
used in most college classes. 

He pointed out that these 
anthologies include the works of 
a select group of whitr male 
writers, and that very few 
black, women, Indian, and 
virtually no Chicano writers are 
included. 

This discriminatory practice 
exludes those writers whose

works might , in some way, 
disrupt what he called " .. .the 
status quo. " He said a person 
who puts together such an 

antholo~y isn't necessarily 
" ... the bourgesoisie ... but he 
obviously one of they 
bureaucrats ." 
" ... a lillie group of dudes who 
reflect the little group of dudes 
that run this. And that (their 
selection '01 writings in 
anthologies) will be their 
interpretation of history, so as to 
support the continuation of the 
status quo." 

After about twenty minutes 
of speaking . he answered 
questions from students on 
matters like disco, jazz, and the 
young black musicians he 
considers to be the major jazz 
voices in America , which 
included such names as Julius 
Hemphill , Arthur Blythe, Don 
Pullen, The Art Ensemble of 
Chicago, Air ,and others. 

He said much of the "fusion" 
jazz that 's been selling well is 
what he called "commerce" 
rather than art, or music made 
solely to make money . 

He referred to disco as being 
nothing more tha n a diluted 
version of black urban blues, a 
non · stop muzac ky quality 
that lulls people to sleep and 
acts as a soporific . 

"They don't even announce 
the tunes now" he said, "they 
don't give you a break. I have 
nothing against dancing, I like 
dancing , but I can't dance 
forever. I have to take a break 
and make use of the other part." 
Baraka pointed to his head. 

After his talk, he gave a 
reading of his latest poetry in 
HL 1402. Here, the audience 
was wit~ss to his (literally) 
incredible style of reading, 
which incorporates a series of 
gurgles, howls , and word 
divisions which add a strong 
emphasis to his poems, giving 
them an almost musical quality. 

His direct statements were , 
,much like his poetry , mostly in 
the form of colloquial black 
English , (" ... comy mutha· 
luckas in top hats ... "). Among 
his images was one which 
described Vampire bats 
hanging out on the upstairs 
porch of the White House (" .. .is 
that you, Bda?"). 

Baraka is not only one of the 
key figures in black American 
literature, but in a ll American 

~terature as well . His poetry and 
prose , through it's seemingly 
unending changes in style and 
political tone , ranks in quality 
beside that of Gary Snyder, Lew 
Wel -h, Philip Whalen, Norman 
Mailer, James Baldwin , and 
other significant writers from the 
Fifties, Sixties, and into the late 
Seventies. His verse is spiced 
with a brilliant twist of sardanic 
humor, and his ability as a 
reader is unsurpassed. 

Perhaps someday America, 
and UCSD, will recognize 
Baraka's writings as one of the 
most important and impressive 
bodies of work that has been 
produced in American literature 
in the latter half of the 20th 
century.

'Julius ' . Done Good 
Diaphanous c loud s of 

napthalene rose from woolen 
fugitives of the closet and 
drawer. The rheumy June air 
insinuated itself among the 
bundled spectators, while 
nymphs of the marine layer, 
called forth by the reverberating 
hallos of forelorn pt!acocks, 
bedewed a ll things with fairy 
tears. 

It was none other than the 
setting of the first production of 
the 30th San Diego National 
Shakespeare Festival. No flag 
flew to proclaim the play a 
tragedy, but thus it was - the 
tragedy of Juliu. Caesar. 

reckon I done slept clear 
through him a time or two. But 
doggone it, exceptin' for it lasted 
three hours, this here show's a 
dandy - especially if you got a 
hankerin' fo r history and such 
like. Even if you ain't, it's a darn 
sight beller than them girly 
shows. It 's got killin' and blood. 

Julius Caesar is one of 
Shakespeare's shortest and 
most succinct plays. It focuses 
on the conflict between personal 
morality and successful political 
leadership ... 

The taciturn edge Jonathan 
McMurtry gives to his Brutus is 
in form with this production's 
general insistence on character 
traits: Cassius is appropriately 
hungry -look ing , Casca is 
undeniably oily and Mark 
Antony is as smug as an 
overgrown baby let loose in 
Toys-R-Us. 

Katherine plays Portia and Jonathan McMurtry 
Now old Julius Grab-the-Girl-

Quickly and I haven't hit it off 
too good in the past , and I 

Well , that's what all them 
books say and they all got a lot 
of hoopla about ambition and 
some mean feller called Prince 
Matchabelli to boot. But that 
ain't the good parI. It's the way 
everything moves right along 
like it does . First you got a 
stabbin' here, then you got a 
murder there, then you have a 
big showdown and it looks like a 
whole heap of people get killed 
and then a whole heap of people 
up and kill themselves .... 

They got a ghost too - that's 
old Julius come back from the 
dead to haunt the rapscallions 
who stabbed him. He's all pale 
lookin' and he 's got on the same 
dress he wore the day they did it. 
Gave me the creeps, tha t's for 
darn sure . I don't mind that the 
fellers all wear dresses too much 
since they ain't too girly-Iookin' , 
but they oughter wash 'em when 
they get 'em bloody.

Schizo 'Winter Kills' Survives 
That Winter Kills has been 

released at all is no small 
mitacle . Three years ago the 
film 's producers ran out of 
money and production came to 
an a brupt halt with only a week 
of shooting left. Usually such a 
condition means death to the 
film, but not in this case. In 
1978, actor Jeff Bridges got 
production rolling again so that 
the film co uld finally be 

co mpleted . Luckily , th e 
schizophrenic nature of the film 
works to conceal its intermittent 
history. As a finished product, 
Winter Kills offers a n 
intriguing, comical but finally 
unsatisfying excursion into an 
Al ice-in- Wond erla nd world 
where nothing is as it seems. 

discovers evidence which points 
to a conspiracy behind the 
assassination of his brother, a 
U.s. President (shades of the 
Kennedy assassina tion can be 
found here). From here on in the 
complexi ti es multiply fa sler 
than rabbits so please don't ask 
me to explain. 

The process of falling on 
one 's own sword, as it is 
portrayed at the Globe , 
suggests a bizarre sexual rite .... 

In the cool of a San Diego 
evening, a very interesting (yes, 
interes ting) presentation of 
W ill iam Shakespeare 's Julius 
Caesar drew to a close for the 
first of many times to come. 
Across the sky the stars paced 
out the last of three hours , and 
mockingbirds began to sing in 
noisy irreverence as ignorant 
eucalyptus turned their silver 
leaves to the moon. It is not 
theirs to know the deeds of men. 

The plot , which almost defies 
explanation , is set in motion 
when Nick Kegan (Bridges) 

Based on Richard Condon's 
novel, Winter Kills focuses 

(please tum to page 14) 

Aw, that ain't so. It takes 
some mighty good actors to go 
stabbin' themselves like thaI. 
That fellpr Brutus, exceptin' for 
his whin i.lg, did the job real nice-
like. 

Who shall te ll them Brutus

Mehan's case is one of those

attempt to introduce student 
opinion to the tenure review

Mehan recommended, 
however, that students not get

he believed that would

the proceedings . 

"S tudents tend to be

of this type of situation," said 
Mehan. " I don't think the CAP

the students' protests ," he said.

management's clumsy attempts at an anti·union canwaign 
certainly didn 't hurt the CNA's chances. 

'Winter Kills ': The Rich, Powerful 

For the service workers ' unionization vote - which followed 
closely after the CNA election - Scripps Memorial stuck with 
West Coast Industrial Relations. After the four AFL·CIO unions 
lost the election, they claimed unfair labor practices by Scripps 
Memorial , and plan to file charges with the National Labor 
Relations Board. 

While representatives of the unions have refused to give any 
specifics about the alleged unfair practices, they say the charges 
center on actions taken by West Coast ." (Continued from page 13) 

on people who have an excess 
of wealth and power. John 
Hou.ton, as Pa Kegan, is a 
ruthless bu.ineuman who has a 
giant computer center 
(something out of James Bond) 
which keeps tabs on everybody 
and everything. Another 

character in Pa Kegan's class 
plays war games with real tanks

takes a darkly comical slant on 
his material, and whereas he 
fai ls on the conventional levels 
of storyline and characteri· 
zation, he fascinates one 
stylistically . Many of his images 
succeed in their flamboyance 
such as the scenes in the 
computer are a visual triumph. 

Coalition 
(Continued from page 1) 
said Caffrey. 

Students come here for the 
area as well as the academics, 
added Keder. 

The coalition, with support 
from Muir Provost John 
Stewart, will sponsor a student 
internship here this summer. 
The interns will receive four 
units in return for research on 
the North City West issue. The 
coalition plans to make public 
the results of the research. 

Management officials at Scripps Clinic took a different tack than 
their counterparts at Scripps Memorial. 

~ey considered retention of West Coast, then rejected the idea, 
opbng for a more personal campaign against the CNA. Blair 
Sadler, vice president and director of the clinic , met with groups of 
nurses, as did Donna Fosbinder, director of nursing. 

Sadler also spoke willingly with the media about the unionization 
effort and the steps he was taking to convince nurses it was 
unnecessary. 

Again, as at Scripps Memorial, it is unclear how big a p<'.rt 
Sadler's efforts played in determining how the nurses voted in the 
certification election. But his more open style certainly didn't hurt 
him in the vote. 

Now UCSD is faced with a unionization effort by AFSCME, one 
that is sure to become more intense in the upcoming months . How 
have UCSD personnel officials reacted to this fact? 

From all indications, they have reacted poorly. According to 
,AFSCME offi cial Jim Stronski, . UCSD officials have been 
systematically harrassing union members, telling them that if they 
leave the union, their grievances will be alleviated. 

AFSCME has filed a writ of mandate in Superior Court, asking 
that UCSD stop such practices. They way university officials reael 
to this writ, and the way they act in the coming months as AFSCME 

or~anizes on campus, will have a great effect on the way employees 
here vote in certification elections.

Ronson. I don't know why, but 
Bowie has allowed chaos to reo 
enter his music. But for me, the 
best news is the lyrics. Rather 
than the myth·maker or the 
prophet , we are given "Bowie 
engage," writing about wife· 
beating, disco DJs, and (horror 
of horrors!) the dangers of 
money. 

With his usual aplomb , 
David has ripped off vocal 
mannerisms, lyric style and, 
encoura2imrlv. musical intent 
from Talki"B Head.' David 
Byrne, trimming it with Work 
on a Wing.type ballads. 

Brian Eno', syntho· technics 
are still in evidence, especially 
on the jarring African Night 
Flight, but his meticulous 
production isn 't; this record is 
so dirty, it sounds like someone 
let Iggy into the control room, 
after plying Alomar with lSI . 
It 's great; anyone who's liked 
Bowie's mutations up to now

Whales Supported Here 
By Cindy Beveridge 

Staff Writ ... 
Unlike 10 many organi-

zation. ~at · come to UCSD 
each year,f1ourish for a few 
week. and then dwindle into 
oblivion, Greenpeace already 
appean to have a promising 
future on campus, . 

Greenpeace is a non-profit 
international organization 
aiming primarily to preserve the 
remnants of the whale nation, 

It gained worldwide acclaim 
when members succeufully 
placed themselves between the 
shot of the harpoon gunner and 
the whales. 

New to the campus last 
quarter, the club hal already 
received strong support from 
students, according to Mike 
Cooper, president and founder 
of the organization at UCSD, 
Participation hal been high at 
the various introductory 
activities Greenpeace has held 
in preparation for next year, he 
said. 

Cooper 
with the 
success. 

said he is pleased 
club's preliminar} 

" If interest stays this high 
next year, I think we can 
become a big part of the 
Greenpeace movement," said 
Cooper. 

Ac c ompli s hm e nts on 
campus are channeled into the 
San Diego chapter, which 
helped Cooper eet up the club on 
campus. Together they put top 
priority on educating the public 
on the slaughter of the whales 
and the baby harp seal, said 
Cooper. 

Another important objective 
of the club is to gather financial 
support, according to Cooper. 
nus year a table has been set up 
at Revelle to sell T -shirts and 
buttons while c olle c ting 
signatures for various petitions. 
. One of the most important 
petitions calls for a 10.year 
moratorium on commercial 
whaling . A ccording to 

Greenpeace, every 15 minutes 
a whale dies , shot by a harpoon 
which explodes inside his body. 

Included in the club's plans 
for next fall are movies, 
speakers and physical action 
when necessary, said Cooper. 
Primarily, however, "making 
every body aware of the 
situation is our main emphasis," Greenpeace rallied at Scripps Institute last spring, 
he added. 

Kerr to Speak at Graduation 
By Jon Goetz 

Clark Kerr, former UC 
President who helped establish 
UCSD, will speak on the 
University ' s successes at 
Revelle's graduation a week 
from Sunday. 

Kerr, who has been named 
the "mosl influential" person in 
the field of education three times 
in a US News and World 
Report poll chairs the Carnegie 
Council on Higher Education, a 
position he has held since he left 
UCSD in 1967. 

He plans to speak to the 
Revelle graduates about the 
development of UCSD, which 
he term s a " spectacular 
success." Kerr and the UC 
Regents founded campuses al 
Irvine, Santa Cruz and San 
Diego during his tenn as UC 
President with the intention of 
creating three very different 
universities , he said, 

UC San Diego was designed 
to be a campus with large 
colleges, Santa Cruz a campus 

with small colleges and Irvine a 
more centralized campus. 

K~rr's nine-year term as UC 
President spanned an era of 
turbulence a t UC Berkeley in 
the 19605. Conflicts arising 
from tha t campus eventually 
cost him his job. 

During this lime Kerr directed 
systemwide administrators to 
deed a piece of land on the 
fringe of the Berkeley campus to 
the ci ty of Berkeley for use 
toward fr ee speech activities. 
Controversy arose when other 
Rege nt s and B er k e ley's 
Chancellor refused to do so. 

University rules at the time 
prohibited candidates for office 
and communists from speaking 
on ca mpus , and lim ited 
student's rights for political 
action on campus. 

A sit·in at Berkeley's Sproul 
Hall in that era once again 
placed Kerr in a controversial 
position, Kerr refused to allow 
police to intervene in the 
demonstration , but then -

Governor Reagan ordered 
police to break up the 
disturbance and arrest the 
demonstrating students. 

"What disturbed the more 
co nservative Rege nt s," 
remarked Kerr , "was that the 
Chancellor brought in 600 
police and I refused to allow 
them on campus." 

Eventually, these events led 
Reagan and the conservative 
forces on the Board of Regents 
to oust the President in 1967. 

Kerr was also c redited 
with the Donohue Act of 1960, 
which established the California 
" master pla n" for h ighe~ 
education. T he plan set 
admission standards for the 
University to allow only 12 ,5% 
of high school graduates to gain 
admission to a Uc. 

He was also responsible for a 
major decentralization of the 
UC system which allowed 
Chancellors much more 
responsibility over day to day 
operations, 

Before accepting the UC 
President's position in 1958, 
Kerr taught at Ohio's Antioch 
College, Stanford University, 
Washington, a nd UC B6"keley. 
In addition, he has published a 
number of books on universities 
and labor relations. His la test 
publication, a Carnegie Council 
report entitled Fair Practices in 
Higher Education , was 
released in April. 

Renters 
(Continued from page 4) 
from retaliating against renters 
who exercise privileges under 
the new measure. 

So far , GSMHOL has not 
encountered much opposition. 
"The ..eal battle will start if and 
when the initiative makes the 
ballot ," said McNaul , who 
expects strong negat ive 
reactions from the real estate 
lobby whi c h includes 
contractors a nd property 
owners,
