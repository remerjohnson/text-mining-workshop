ReluYn of Ihe Jedi----------------
Film Benefits Hospital 

By CANOLE 
The world has waited in 

\vonder for three years to 
see who George Lucas will 
present as Y oda 's "at her 
hope" to help Luke 

kywalker combat the dark 
side of the Force. 

For the kids at San Diego 
Children's Ho,>pital and 
Health Center Yoda's 
"ot her hope" will be a 
present from the people at 
I ucasfilm Ltd., in the form 
of a ben fit previe\\,' of 
Re/urn oj the jedi" to help 
combat pediatric disease. 

"I see these benefits as an 
expression of Lucas' 
feelings of commitment to 
the American public, " said 
benefit organizeri. who 
askecl \0 remain ,mon)· 
mous "He cot! Id have

"Lucas felt the suu:ess of 
the Star Wars Saga has 
been due to t he interest of 
children and the child in all 
of us . Therefore he wanted 
to return to these youngJedi

MCC Facility Lost 
San Diego lost out to 

Austin, Texas earlier this 
week in a bid to be the site of 
a major computer research 
institute built by the 
Microelectronics alld 
Computer Technology 
Corp. (MCC). 

One of the main reasons 
MCC cho e Austin were 
"doubts about California's 
longterm commitment to 
top-quality education," 
according to a Los Angeles 
Times article Wednesday. 
The loss of the facility 
represents a heavy blow to 
California's economy and 
amounts to a slap in the face 
of the University of 
California_ 

University efforts to 
rescind Governor George 

Deukmejian's recent budget 
cuts continue in Sacra-
mento today. 

The loss of the MCC 
facility, and the possibility 
of simi liar los es in the 
future may be a factor in 
swaying the governor away 
from his stringent budget-
balancing agenda enough 
that he allows legislature-
mandated budget increases 
for UC to pass across his 
desk unmolested. 

The governor's office still 
declines comment on what 
Deukmejian's reaction will 
be to budget hikes for UC, 
bu t the pressu re is 
mounting. Next week, the 
Guardiatl will take an in-
depth look at the budget's 
progress in Sacramento. 

ted a personal pride 
amongst the many volun-
teer . 

"The desire of the 
volunteers, like Lucas. is to 
step back from the spotlight 
so the public will focus 
primarily on the programs 
and needs of the hospital." 

In regards to their own 
involvement in the benefit, 
the organi/ers commented : 
"Everything our company 
does is anonvmous. We are 
underwriting the cost of the 
benefits so that the $75 per 
ticket will go directly to 
Children\ Hospital. We 
expect the sellout audience 
wi ll raise a totdl of $:32,7;)0. 

"The evening of the 
performance there will be a 
sunset patio buffet at the 
Fletcher Estate with Darth 
Vader as guest. Then buses 
will shutt le these "Friends 
ofYoda" to the preview. We 
1WW have sold two-thirds of 
the tickets ." 

Rodgers commented on 
the contribution of the 
benefit on In'half of 
Children's Hospital. "Inour 

applications to Lucasf!lm~

Ignoran t on Madrid 
E d itor: 

In an attempt at bemg 
humorous, Scott Rhoads, m 
hiS article on l'.1adrid. came 
across as an Ignorant, Ugly 
Amencan, The type of humour 
tha t Rhoads tried to put across 
would be better suited to RV 
Magazine or an Idiot's Guideto 
Travel. Rhoad compared 
Madrid to Tijuana, On what 
basis was this comparison 
made? Or wa it made because 
the people in Tijua na 'peak 
the same la ng uage and 
therefore must be the same? 
Rhoads describes one of the 

Sights ne sa\\ on hi~ hus lour 
as "some art building." Is that 
the same thing as an art 
museum? lias Rhoads ever 
heard of the Prado Museum?

Legislation Pending 
on High Utility Bills 
An open le tter: 

The Consumers' lTtility 
Board (CUB) legislation which 
I pending in acramento is a 
reasonable anwer to 
skyrocketlllg utility bills. Yet, 
it i" facing defeat due to lack of 
ratepa}er input. l tility 
customers must act now or 
accept higher bills in the 
fu ture. 

The CL'B IS a board elected 
by all contribut ing ratepayers. 
Like the utility compa nie" , 
thi!' board would employ a 

profes~lOnal staff of la\\-yer.." 
accountants, energy analysts. 
etL'. This ;"taff would compile 
III formation to be presented 
before the Public l Tlili t ies 
Commmlssion (PlIC) when, 
for tnstance, SDG&E asked 
for another rate increase. The 
U'B would finally give 
ratepayers effective input in 
the ratemaking process and 
would assure that a point of 
view other than the ul1llues'ls 
reprec.,cntrd before the PUC. 

The CU B legis lation IS 
simple and proven . It would 
require utility companies to 
enclose CUB information with 
their bill!-> on a quarterly baSIS. 
(The CUB would pay 
additional costs.) Stnce uti lity 
compan Ies enjoy a legal 
monopoly that ratepayers are 
obliged to support, thiS "eems 
a reasonable requirement. 
With a mll1lmal cash outlay, 
ratepayers Will have an 
opportunity to create a 
substitute for normal market 
pressures , bringing some 
realll Y to Ihe conditions undl'r 

\\ hich the utility companies 
operate. Wisconsin ha~ 
created a simi lar program 
with gratifying resu lts. The 
rate of increase in utility bills 
there has fallen significantly 
since its implementatIOn. 

The next fe\\ weeks are 
crUCIal fOrlhe CUB legislallon. 
Reports for Sacramento reveal 
that legislators are not 
recei\ Ing enough letter.., from 
constItuents supporting eL'S 
to induce them to \'ore for it. 
After all, If their COn<,llluents 
aren' t concerned, most 
legIslators would rather not 
n~k opposing the powerful 
utilities. Letters can make the 
dIfference in pa'iSll1l{ t hi'i bill. 
The effort would create 
tremendous le\'erage for the 
CL.:B coalition. Legislators 
assume that each individual 
\\' ho wnte'i represents many 
more \" ho are very concerned. 
At thIS point, I€'tler writing is 
the key to passing the CU B 
legis latIOn . Assemb lyman

The Parking Lot Nightmare 
By JEFF EA STER 

HaVIng recently Jomed the 
legions of the UCSD parking 
lot warrior~, I must expre~s 
my outrage at this deplorable 
situation. Up u nt iI this 
quarter, I was a Revelle dorm, 
dweller. tota lly oblivious to the 
constant ~truggle going on 
qU ietly to the south of my 
peacefu l dorm. My car sat 
content in its parking spot for 
weeks at a time wit hout 
moving. The only time I 
needed a parking spot was on 
returning from a Friday night 
beer run , and spaces \\ ere 
alway" plentiful, since 
e\eryone else was also on a 
beer run. But all g<xx\ dreams 
must come to an end. and I 
omtnously decided to move to 
La Jolla. 

:vJ\ m(Ae \\ as tantamount to 
a det:larat Ion of war again..,t all 
commutcrs. I quickl} reahzed 
(after the fir ... t day I)f c1a"ses) 
that 1 mav ha\e bitten off a 
little bit - more than m\ 
Volbwagon could handle. 
Arri\' ing innocently at 10::30 
Monday morning, I cruised 
'ilo\\ I) lllto the parking lot 
fully expecting rows and rows 
of empty yellow carports to 
beckon for my patronage, I 
quickly noticed a strange 
tension in the a i r. The guy in 
the Pinto behind me screeched 
past as soon as he saw an 
opening large enough to fit his 
car. I glanced over at him as he 
passed. He was grimacing 
menacingly, his face was beet 
red, and snowy \\ hite foam 
dribbled down his chin. I could 
hear him "creamlllg ob.,ceni 
tie.., /)\el' the roar of hIS engine 
as he disappeared around the 
corner of the aisle. I noticed he 
had taken mv door handle wit h 
him, and I ,vondered why he 
had been so upset. I figured he 
must ha\'e been a physics 
rroajor late for a problem 
"ect lon. 

Fifteen minutes later I s t ill 
hadn't found an empty 
parki ng place, a nd I had driven 
past the same orange I londa so 
many times that [ felt that the 
driver (a strange sou l WIth 
gran ny glas..,es and a beard) 
and I were old frie nd s. Rut 
perse\'erence su rfaced and, 
undaunted, I resumed my 
quest. After a few more 
cirCUIts of t he lot, I came upon 
a girl backing out her 
Triumph . I trembled with joy 
as I waited for her to get ou t of 
my way. But before I cou ld 
blink, an orienta l fellow in a 
Camaro had usurped my 
space. I ro ll ed down my 
window to \Olce m) dIsgust, 
but. when I "a w the macht'll' he 
\\'Ielded In my eli reet ion, I 
qUIckly dl'nd d to rl'sume: my 
search. 

\fter whal s«'mt'rI IIkl' 

sc\'eral hours, [ finall\' found 
an open "pot, and r 'il()\\ Iy 
eased m) car into it. r had no 
idea what time it \vas, so I 
decided to head towards my 
first class, hoping to catch a 
few last minute gems of 
wisdom. Upon arriving at 
USB, I rea lized quickly that 
the person down there talkmg 
about nons ingular matrice" 
was not my socio logy 
professor. I glanced a t the 
clock, and a lmost had a 
coronary. It was 3:43 and j had 
mIssed al l threeofmy lecture~ . 
I slowly trudged back to my 
car, \'a ndalizin~ any UCSl) 
property that got in Ill) wa~. 
After ;"earching in the \ ast 
ocean of cars fur up" ards of an 
hour, j found m~ poor car, WII h 
se\'eral long ... cratches along 
the d(xlrs and a nice t \\ehe 
dollar parkIng ticket tucked 
under my windshield \\ iPl'r. 
Apparently my yellow parkll1g 
st icker did not give me the 
privdege of parking in a while 
space. Need less to sa\ I shed 
se\'eral gallons of tears and 

spent the next three weeks in a 
sanilarium, 

Ry no\\', though, I've learned 
the ropes , and routinely arrive 
at school three hours before 
Illy first class. And with the 
mechcation I recel\'e for my 
shattered nerves, I'm fina ll y 
able to voice my thought s on 
t hIS sad sit uation. Therefore, 1 
demand that someofthewhite 
spaces, espec ia lly in the 
He\'elle lot and theadmi nist ra , 
tive section of campus be 
changed to yellow. I've seen 
drivers flg-hting for yellow 
... paces \\ Ith all the huma11lty 
of seagull s figh t i ng- for a

close,ended game. The gamt'o 
SCI in Apnl , 19HH, began \\'Jlh 
the lIS players trying 10 
nulllf, the mo\ement of 5.000 
Cuhans into Nicaragua 
(th rl'atening Honduras), while 
the Sm'iets tried to contain 
and destroy pro·western 
Yugoslav Army units in Ihat 
country's ci\'il war. Pakistan 
and India were not helping, 
becau, e they were on the verge 
of declaring war against each 
ot her. SlIlce both cou nt ries are 
by t hen nuclear powers, the 
con fhct was of major concern.

was 1 () scnd 3,000 Marines to 

lI()ndura~ (countering the 
Cu hans ), whi Ie the SO\ iets 
sent IO,O(){) paratroops into 
Belgrade and began a naval 
blockade of the pro-western 
Y ugosla\ port s to keep out 
western arms shipments to 
the partisans. 

Mo\e two began ,",: jth the 
reading of the intelligence 
reports. The Soviet blockade 
had turned back 1 \vo Italian 
freighlers, after off- load ing the 
"military supp lies" th e 
freighters were carryi ng. East 
Cerman LalXlr unions (the 
"Umty" union in particular) 
had set general strike dates, 
and, In the Ne\\ World, the

Cindy Skadron. Second row: Julie Zianno, Lori Sherda, Jackie Jaquint 
C hristine Grimaud. Not pictured: Sharon Co~en . ' 

What sunny day in May would be complete without a frisbee and a cold 
Miller beer? Well it was just that kind of day Sunaay when Better Luck This 
Time ran by Joe's Frisbee Team 8,3 in Women's Ultimate Disc action. 

Better Luck ThiS Time jumped out to a 52 halftime lead and stayed in 
control for the rest of the game, allowing "Joe" just one second half goal. 

Gina Lombardi and Julie Zianno give these ultimate goddesses 
outstanding speed. Take their wheels and mix them with the fine passing of 
Jackie Jaqumt, Kim Swanson, Chrlstme Grimaud and Cmdy ''Flick'' 
Skadron and you've got the recipe for a winner. 

S.A. Kevin Gunnmg says he wants to party with you Better Luck ThiS

FOR ALL YOU DO ... THIS 
BUD PAGE IS FOR YOU! 

Softball Scene CoedMA Odds Comments 
As we come to the close of 

another regular softball season I'd 
like to write about some of the 
highlights and low lights of the 
season. Between all the pregame 
barbeques and postgame Buds 
there have been some interesting 
happenings .... There have been a 
couple firsts on UCSD's diamonds. 
The day that they erected the new 
Warren apartments and a ~nce 
was put up every left-handed hitter 
on campus has dreamed of being 
the first to hit one out on Warren-
North field. That was four years ago 
and nobody had yet hit one out. 
Bad wind conditions and the fact 
that it was a dam long way out, 330 
feet to be exact, made a dinger 
almost impoSSible. That was until 
Skip Piper of the Sliding Drabos 
stepped up to the plate and 
proceeded to boom out the first 
real home run over a fence in UCSD 
softball history. I guess we'll have to 
call Warren field the house that 
Piper builL.There have been some 
great pitching performances at 
UCSD. Shutouts, one hitters, two 
hitters, but never the elusive no-
hitter. There are 138 games played 
every week and over 1,000 games 
played every year. That's more than 
15,000 1M softball games played in 
1M softball history. But never has 
there been a no-hitter thrown. It 
seemed like it would never 
happen, Never say never I've heard 
somewhere before. I guess Mark 
Warner believes in that saying.

out the last man to register the first 
no-hitter for the Fried Iguanas. The 
first no-hitter in UCSD history .. .. 
Speaking of some great pitching, 
Charlie SUrh of Pathetic struck out 
seven batters last weekend. That's 
no fluke. Last year he struck 11 
batters in one game. He can wing it 
with the best of them .... Paul 
Prendeville walked six batters in a 
row in his last appearance for 
Jockularity. They hooked him and 
sent him off to Montreal for a bag of 
peanuts .... The most runs scored by 
a team in a game this year was by 
Boogie In Your Butt. They scored 39 
ruf'\s ... Most total runs, On The Ball 
with 103 runs so far. That's a 20.6 
run per game clip ..... The Soft 

Brawlers have allowed only 2.5 runs 
per game for the fewest runs 
allowed this year .... Look for some 
big games coming up. 5-0 Viva 
Cerveza vs. Rupe's Troops this 
Saturday at 11 :00 on Muir-South. 
This should be a good one ... Also 
look for a dream match of the #1 
and #2 ranked teams In the Men's A 
division on Saturday, June 4th, at 
5:00 on Muir-South. 5-0 and #1 
ranked Backdoor Men vs. 5-0 and 
#2 ranked Lingusmen .... What have 
they done lately department? Last 
year's Men's A champs the 
Dartmouth Boys are 3-3 in Men's

ups John DeLorean's nose are 0-3 
in Men's M A A case o f reverse 

sandbag .... lnjury report: half the 1M 
program is on the injured reserve 
for strawberries on the legs from 
sliding with shorts on. Come on 
people, it takes brains to get in 
UCSD doesn't it? I guess you all lack 
the speed of the Budman ... And 
you thought the Budman forgot 
Kevin Bateman, didn't you? How 
can you forget Mr. Cool. Well he's

The big intramural e\ ent of 
the year IS coming up thIs 
weekend. The All · Cal 
Intramural Sports Fes tl\al 
will be held at UC Riverside, 
and w1l1 feature intramural 
teams from all nine UC 
campuses competing in tennis, 
table tennis, softball, and 
volleyball. All events are coed, 
and the teams were selected to 
represent the Tritons through 
tournament s held at the 
beginning of the quarter. 

This is t he time of the 
quarter when the regular 
seasons in the variou s sports 
are \\ indmg down and the 
playoff pIctures are shapmg 
up. 
VOLLE} 'BALL 

Some of the teams tha t look 
hke they can make plans for a 
~econd seao.;on are: In the 

women 's A division, Good 
Try, led by team captain 
Christine Wang, is 14·1 and 
lex)king good ; this seems to be 
the team to beal. In men 's AA, 
Altered Momes at 13·2 has 
tl) be among the favorites. 
fncidentally, Altered Momes 
along with Sets & Violence 
\\'ill make up the coed 
volleyball squad at the Sports 
Fe ·t. The men 's A division 
s hapes up with the former 
team of the week We Know 
the Ferg (i s·(l), Inter-
racially Mixed (14·1), Blue 
(12·3), and Irish Setters (10· 
5) as the crea m of the crop.

:\l ollv Wheatlc\', who had been 
training for lht., heptathlon all 

1 year, finally had an opportu· 
I nity to com pete in one. She 

was it littl e di sa ppointed with 
her performa nce, but Coach 
Skid felt "he did ext remely 
well and \\arned that "she's 
fa"t on her way to a birth in the 
Nat lonal..," In the ) ears to 
come. Ot her... \\ ho dId well 
\\ere Carol\ n Lerch in the 

1500 meters and Leslte 
Sanders in the :3000 metero.;. 

The mood on the team is 
generally upbeat now as 
members are expected to come 
back m full force next season. 
Adding to their talent will be 
the exceptional running of 
Chris Bowlus, whu wa<..; unable 
to com pete this year because of 
an mjury. The squad will also 
be expect ing a lot from this 
year's freshmen and perhaps 
some new incoming st udent s.

II sailed smooth ly through the 
regular 'eason with a 5·0 
record and are probables to 
repeat. Another team to look 
for are the F1oaties , who head 
into the playoffs at 4·1. The 
coed A Cruiser League boasts 
the top scoring team in all of 
water polo. The Wet Dreams 
have scored 95 poinls in five 
gamcs they have pillyed for a 
19 points per game average 
and lln undefeated record. 
Other teams to watch for are 
Swamp and Nads; both 
teams check in at 4· I. 

Note : All AA teams will 
enter the playoffs v,:ith AAA 
st<ltu s and the top A or 
sandbagging AA teams will be 
moved to AA - all this at the 
discretion of the intramural 
offIce.

WIth playoff berth~ on the 
111ll'. four of the "ix games 
played on Sunday we r e 
decided by one goal. In AA, 
Rastaman Vibration slipped 
bv Inner Discs 7·6, and 
Frank Puss defeated Disc 
Jockeys 65. In single A, 
When the Disc is Over 
outlasted Disc Jockeys II 7·

of the day the Disc Offs 
knocked off Dirty White

SOFTBALL 

Every week the LOp teams in 
each sport get the ink . But for 
those teams to be at the top, 
t here has to be some teams llt 
th e bottom. No\\ . here'" their 
time in the sun. 

Going into the bOll om of the 
se\'enth it looked as if The 
Pope's Nose might pull out 
its finit victory . But Hokusai. 
led by Dan ' Kaufman, who 
went four for SIX, hit two

The San Diego Repertory 

Theatre's outstanding produc-
tion of Mark Medoff's Children 
of a Lesser God is a compelling 
journey into the frightening and 
fascinating world of the deaf. 
This Tony Award-winning drama 
introduces the hearing 
population to a language and a 
culture traditionally foreign to 
the theatre, the domain of the 
spoken word. This touching love 
5tory of a hearing man and a 
deaf woman reveals the realm of 
.,i1ence, . a silencc full of 
.,ound," in which the deaf live. 

.Jdme., Leeds is a fonner 
CJIl1PU., rddical and Peace Corps 
vol unt ecr whose desire to help 
other., draws him to work as a 
speech therapist in an 
institution for the hearing-

impaired and the deaf. Sarah 
Norman is a 23-year-old 
nonspeaking deaf woman 
alienated by the attitudes of 
normal people toward the 
"lesser" members of society. 

Unable to hear or speak since 
birth, Sarah 's life is governed by 
the hearing community. 
Believed to be mentally 
retarded as a young girl. Sarah 
was placed by her unsympathe-
tic mother in an institution for 
the deaf, where she has lived for 
the past 18 years or her life. 
Defiant towards tho e who have 
defined her existence for her 
( 5hc ..,ay"'.. She means .... She 
wants ..... ), Sarah isolatcs herself 
in..,ide her hardened exterior 
hell. Now too old to stay in the 

school. this homele~ WOllldn 
remain as a maid in the dorms. 

An Arts Magazine Serving the UCSD Community 
Vol. 3, No.7 ay 19, 1983 

She refuses to leam to lip-read 
or speak, insisting that her 
language of signs isan adequate 
form of communication in her 
situation. 

James becomes Sarah 's 
teacher, friend, and lover, the 
only person who tries to 
understand her as an individual. 
Their relationship is trained by 
the common activities the 
hearing take for granted in daily 
life: listening to music 
answering the telephonc 
conversing over Italian food, 
playing bridge, and even tilt' 
personal and intimcltl', 1ll<1kin9 
love. Penetrating her .,ih'ncc 
Jame., discover." S.nah to be d 
sensitive intelligent 1m ing 
human being. 

The team of I'eter A. J<1tob~ 
.1I1d Raliha ['Opt hn .I as l.Hlle., 

and Sarah is exceptional. Jacobs 
performs the role of James, 
described by director Sam 
Woodhouse as more challeng-
ing than King Lear, with great 
sensitivity , and emotional 
range. Appearing on stage for 
the plays entire two-hour 
duration , Jac(lbs portrays 
rna terfully what amount to a 
dual role. tIe speaks hi<> own 
lines in b(lth English Jnd 
American Sign l..mguage.

Tiny hollow snaps trap unwary 
flying things between soaking 
slippery palms and miniature probing 
fingers delicately poke and prod 
while wide limpid pools of ashes 
search for pain and remove 
transparent wings that 
grubby palms blend into 
faded flowers on a cotton skirt. 

Fluorescent sun on chrome chopsticks, 
drone of white faceless 
rubber hands chimes with clinking 
beakers as chloroform tiny claws 
mime silverware on wine glasses.

"You 'll never watch television 
the same way again. " 

- MTV slogan San Diego Gets Its. • • 
complete home entertainment 
room ; and their latest contest 
gives some lucky viewer a 
chance to be in a video with the 
band Loverboy America 's Finest City- finally 

has its MTV (Music Television). 
When the Cox Cable system 
added MTV to its line-up last 
month it opened up the living 
rooms of 350,000 viewers to the 
video music channel. 

Almost everyone has seen or 
heard of the two-year old, 24-
hour-a-day, all-music network, 
and record company executives, 
artists and even radio stations 
are singing the praises of MTV. 

Bands such as Duran Duran, 
Adam Ant and the Stray Cats 
were drowning in the 
conservative current of AOR 
(Album Oriented Rock) before 
they found MTV (or MTV found 
them), Brian Setzer ofthe Stray 
Cats is well aware of this. 
"College radio and MTVwere the 
only two sources that were hip 
to us; promoters couldn't 
understand why we had no 
airplay and were selling out on 
our first tour." 

As these groups gain 
newfound fame, their MTV 
exposure is also paying off at 
the record stores. A recent study 
showed that eight out of ten 
young adults heard ofa band for 
the first time on MTV and six out 
of ten bought or plan to buy an 
album by an artist they saw on 
MTV. Derek Shulman of 
Polygram Records states, "mv 
is a wonderful new way of 
exposing music, Which, if liked 
by the audience, definitely 
translates into sales. And that's 
our bottom line." 

MTV's success did not happen 
overnight, it just seems that 
way. The network was launched 
August 1. 1981 by the Warner 
Amex company (the same 
people who produce the Movie 
Channel) in New York. It was, 
and still is, the only 24-hour, all-
music channel. 

After one year the station had 
6 million subscribers and 700 
affiliates. MTV was voted 

Product of the Year" by 
fortune magazine and one of 
Time'5 Bests of the Year." As it 
approaches its second 
anniversary the network 

currently has 12 million 
subscribers and 1,500 affiliates 
and is seen in all 50 states. 

The foundation of the 
network is the music - rock 
and roll. Artists and record 
companies produce the video 
clips which cost an average of 
$30,000 to $40,000 to make. 
(David Bowie recently spent 
over $150,000 filming his new 
single " Let's Dance " in 
Australia.) 

These tapes are sent to MTV 
for no charge and the program 
director decides what will 
appear on your television. Some 
videos are r~ected because of 
poor quality or because they 
don 't fit in the format. Rick 
James is a little too "soul " for 
MTV, but Michael Jackson fits 
the rock style. Van Halen 's 
" Pretty Woman" was seen as too 
controversial. The music that is 
presented ranges from heavy-
metal to new-wave to reggae 
and even some oldies. 

Five Video Jocks (VJs) 
introduce the songs, present 
music news and do in-studio 
interviews with different 
groups. These VJs are becoming 
celebrities as much as the 
artists themselves. Nina

Blackwood, the first VJ selected 
two years ago and an 
experienced actress, sees the 
role ofa VJ asa cross between an 
actor and a DJ. " We perform a 
little, but mostly we have to be 
up there as ourselves," 

Along with the music and 
news, the network offers a 
variety of specials, interviews 
and live concerts. The latest 
feature they have is called 

MTV Video Jock Nina Blackwood 

. Basement Tapes' where 
unsigned bands can submit 
videos for a chance to win a 
recording contract with EMI 
America. 

Promotional giveaways have 
also played a big part in MTV's 
popularity. Blackwood was in 
town recently to do an in-store 
giveaway at Wherehouse 
Records for the Hall and Oates 
concert. '" think people 
appreciate our coming out and 
getting involved. I like it 
because we (the VJs) get 
feedback from the viewers and 
it s a nice way to meet people." 

MTV has given away a "One 
Night Stand" with Journey, the 
Rolling Stones and Fleetwood 
Mac. Viewers send in cards and 
the \\ inner and three friends are 
flown by Lear jet to see the band 
in concert, given dinner and a 
limousine ride back to the 
airport where they are flown 
home, all within a 24·hour 
period. 

other promotions have 
included a MTV " House Party' 
where the network throws a 
part}' at the \\inner's hou~ 
(they even tossed in $300 to 
clean the rugs \; A .. Hawai ian 
Holiday with Pat Benatar'; A 

. .. 

MTV is succeeding in leaps 
and bounds acros~ the country, 
but what has been t1.e effect in 
our fair city? 

Lucy Dis.'>, marketing director 
for Southwestern Cable, .!oays 
that their has been an increase 
in subscriber~ '>ince thf'yadded 
mv in October. A good 
example of the intere.'>t In mv 
that we have experienced can be 
seen at the front counter. We 
just put a box of 1.000 mv 
buttons out and they were gone 
within a week and we don t hal'e 
very much walk-Up traffic. ' 

The concert busines.s has 
been helped by the network as 
well. Promoter Bill Silva offahn 
and Silva presents thinks it is 
part MTV and part 91X that have 
boosted the music scene in San 
Diego But mv is ob\iously 
reinforcing the careers and 
giving exposure to many bands 
that wouldn 't otherwise get it. . 

The most important sector 
for the record companies is the 
retail outlets. John Broderick of 
Musicland at La Jolla Village 
Square gives tht!m the thumbs-
up. MTV has had a great deal of 
effect on sales at our store. We 
even have a section that 
features many of the bands seen 
on MTV." 

Club Diegos, a new night spot 
in Pacific Beach, features 
dancing to VIdeo music 
Although they don tactually 
sho\'o MTV, man} of the \ ideo,> 
played arc ones that first 
appeared on the channel. 

It seems only natural that a 
combination of t\\O bastions of 
American culture - rock and 
roll and telnision- should get 
along famously, Mn' i~ a dream 
come true for the artists \\ho get 
thc exposure' it i a sa\ior for 
the sagging record industry; it 
is a hit for the cable affiliates 
who don 't ha\'e to pa) for the 
advcrtiser'supported station 
and it is not a minute too '>oon 
for mu . .,ie "tdned teenager". As 
Nina Black\\ood a SImply put

A 'Whammy' of a record from-B-52's 
Whammy 
The B-52's 
Warner Brothers 

By MARK B[U'1t:R 
Virtually every summer the 

music media somewhat 
randomly selects an album to be 
the biggest hit of the season. 
Last year. for example. radio 
stations decided that John 
Cougar was the Ghandi of Rock 
and Roll, so they played his 
terrible, trashy record until even 
casual radio l isteners were near 
nausea. This summer. however, 
radio listeners could fair 
significantly better, The late<;t 

B-52 's disc entitled. Whammy. 
has all the ingredients, both 
commercially and artistically to 
be the hottest album of the 
summer, 

Whammy is a critical release 
for both The B-52 's and Warner 
Brothers Records, After two 
highly successful outings, last 
year's Mesopotamia, flopped 
miserably, which naturally led 
to speculation that the band had 
run out of gas, The B-52 's new 
music, though, is more than 
enough to dispel any rumors of 
a creative decline, 

funny man Fred Schneider 
has returned in fine form to 
restablish his position as the 

foremost comedian in rock, This 
guy could end everyone into 
hi!>terics just by describing a 
recital infarction, Cindy Wilson 
and Kate Pierson still posess 
incredible vocal range, and 
paired with Schieder these three 
handle the vocals with all the 
precision and originality that 
one could possibly ask for. 

With the exception of the last 
half of side two, the tunes on 
this record are vintage 6-52'5, 
Long classified as a collection of 
dancing humorist, the band 
does it's utmost to live up to 
this genre with songs such as 
" Whammy Kiss" and " Butter-

Galas will 
• premiere 

new work 
Avant -garde singer/com -

poser Diamanda Galas will 
present a solo concert of her 
own compositions at 8 pm 
Saturday. May 21. in Sherwood 
Hall at the La Jolla Museum of 
Contemporary Art. 

Diamanda will perform the 
San Diego premiere of 
"Panoptikon," a work for so le 
voice, live electronics and four-
channel tape: and " Wild Women 
with Steak Knives, " for solo 
voice and four microphones. 

This will be Diamanda 's first 
San Diego concert in two years, 
and it will be her only local 
concert this year. She currently 
is a visiting researcher at the 
Center for Music Experiment at 
UCSD. 

Diamanda performs what she 
ca lls "expressionist real-time 
composition and kindred 
operatic rituals, i.e. , rock 
performance, Greek tragic 
theatre. German Expressionist 
performance and other ecstatic 
theatres." 

Her work, she wrote. " is 
primarily concerned with the 
execution, sequentially. 
chordal ly, and/ or contra-
puntally, of different 'processes 
of concentration: 'mental 
states: or 'dramatic states: for 
which vocal sound is the 
primary physical coordinate ... 
It is operatic performance I 
speak of. not mere 's inging.' The 
performance practice I describe 
demands a total dbciplinc of 
the performer as compo~er. 
poet. actor. and virtuoso 
vocalist." 

Diamanda 's performance at 
Sherwood Hall is being 

pre~nLed as part of the feslival 
of New Arts, sponsored by the 
UCSD Center for Music 
Experiment in coordination 
with Sushi. Inc. General 
admission is $10. with preferred 
seating at $15: tickets for 
students and seniors arc $5. 
Tickets are available in advance 
at all Tic-ketron outlet". for 
more information phone Lhe

Expcriment at 452-4383, 

B-52s get the 
"Whammy" 
wntinued from page 5 
bean." which 1V0uld be well 
received in the Comedy Store. as 
in any dance club. "Legal 
Tender" and "Trism" present a 
somewhat more subtle side of 
the band 's humor. but the real 
gem of th is record is "Song for a 
future Generation," whi ch 
besides being both zany and 
me lodi c. gives you an 
opportunity to hear a soliloquy 
from each band member. 
concerning ideas such as Black-
ca pp ed Chickadees and 
illegilimate ch ildren. 

If th ere is a weak point in this 
album. it would have to be the 
music. Ri ck Wilson ju t doesn't 
seen to play his guitar with the 
same bite and power that he 
used on the debut record. This is 
a picky point. however, and 
certainly no reson to dismiss 
this album, Overall , the product 
is pleasantly satisfying and 
definitely worthy of any 
commercial success be towed 
upon it. 

Richard (jere and David Keith are aviation officer candidates in "An Officer and a Gentleman." 

Gere's ~Officer' shows here friday 
By CLYDt:Nt: Nt:[ 

ET and Poltergiesl weren·t 
the only big films to come out of 
the Summer of 1982. An Officer 
and A Gentleman brought quite 
a few people to the theaters. 

It has all the elements of an 
old fashion love story, but it is 

definitely spiced with a fiery 
relationship between Richard 
Gere. portraying lack Mayo. an 
officer candidate, and Debra 
Winger as Paula Pokritki. a 
small town girl. 

Gere turned in an intense 
performance. but Louis Gossett 

Jr. turned in a spectacular 
performance as the domi 
neering drill instructor, Sgt. 
foley. 

The film will play th is friday 
in Mandeville Auditorium at 8 
pm, Tickets are $2 at the Box 
Office. 

Hallucination, reality and Gielgud 
By CLYDt:Nt: Nt:[ 

When does the border 
between reality and hallucina-
tion blur? 

french director Alain Resnais 
examined the complexities of 
this state in his first English 
language film Providence. Sir 
John Gielgud. better known for 
his role in Arlhur, portrays Clive 

langham, a dying novelist 
whose personal pain twists his 
perceptions of reality into 
paranoid hatred and the subject 
of a new book. 

The object of his hallucina-
tion revolves around the 
members of his family. Ellen 
Burstyn, Dirk Bogarde, and 
David Warner. play the various 

members of his ~eemJngly 
ordinary family. 

Resnais juxtaposes reality 
with fantasy in this film, which 
creates a semi-nightmarish 
effect. 

Providence will play tOnight 
in Mandeville at 8 pm Tickets 
can be purchased at the UEO 
Box Office.
