BAC Moves to Halt Step II Plans 
by Paul Osterman III 

Step II construction of the New Student Center, the 
design of wt'aich was approved by the UC Regents last 
week, may be halted if the student segment of the 
Building Advisory Committee (BAC) complete~ their 
present drive. 

"We want to stop it and offer the students something 
better," said Paul Rosen, student architectural con-
sultant for the center. Rosen spoke at a Friday press 
conference with the BAC. 

Student financial consultant Tom leanse said 
students on the BAC want construction halted because 
"the present plans may not be what the students want. 
What's on paper is geared for yesterday." 

In addition , only 28 percent of Step II will be of a 
rec reational or social nature, with the remaining 72 
percent of the space used for administrative and student 
servi ce offices, such as Student Affairs, Financial Aids, 
and Student Employment. 

Pr; sent plans call for the Student Section to contain a 
snack bar and pending University approval and the 
passage of any 18-year-old.drinking law a 'pub'. Mos,t of 
the remaining space is occupied with a lounge . and 
fi replace, and a " mezzanine lounge". Areas for two 
student organization offices and "craft sales" are also 
incl uded in Step II. 

Exclusive of craft sales, the Union has 3,700 usable 
square feet, " the equivalent of a four bedroom house," 
said students on the BAC.

The site for Step II is slated immed',dtely south of the 
Mandeville center, between Gilman Drive and the 
existing Student and Craft Centers just east of the gym . 

Gut Level 
Action to halt Step II began atfer students met with 

"various University administrators two weeks ago," said 

)tep II plans may be halted. 
Tom leanse. "We asked ourselves if Step II is what the 
students want, and gut level react ion was-no!" Names 
of the administrators were not d isclosed . 

According to leanse, Ass istant Vice Chancellor Mary 
Decker spoke to the Chancellor on behalf of students on 
the BAC. Chancellor McElroy reportedly "agreed for the 
center to be what the students want. " Changes in Step II 
are "supported by the Chancellor," l eanse said .

Suggested changes for the St .p II phase of the 
Student Center are the addition of a bowling aile\" cl 
small stage or amphitheatre, and music-practice room 

"We will also be conducting r search on either 
student centers or unions in Southern California," tht> 
BAC said, "to see what they have done " 

Should Step II construction be stopp d, and changes 
made, cost for the center will unaVOidably rise The HAC 
said students would have to bear any Increa In cost A 
rise in the student center fee would be IneVitable for any 
changes, but " only if the students want It," emphaSiled 
the BAC. 

The Triton Times learned that the Issue may be part of 
a Fall quarter student referendum , to Include proposed 
facility changes in detail as reasons for the fee Increas 

Student BAC members stressed that students will be 
able to express thei r opinions or ideas If they contact 
them or drop by the student center now. 

Student members of the BAC are Lincoln Cushing and 
Margery Bennet from Muir College, Irene Bustillos and 
Sylvia Torres from Revelle College, Paul Rosen , student 
consultant on architecture, and Tome Leanse, student

UCSD Accepts Neilsen 
Bid for Third College 

Chancellor Opposes Plus-Minus 

by Jerry Schneider 

Campus Architects and 
Engineers presented to UC 
Regents last week a S6 
million bid by Neilsen 
Construction Co. of San 
Diego for the construction 
of Academic Unit I, the first 
permanent building of 
Third College. 

Charles Powers, campus 
architect, said that the 
company's bid was the 
lowest of four contractors 
who submitted estimates 
May 8. The next highest bid 
was five percent (S300,OOO) 
higher . 

Powers stated that A&E 
estimated the total cost at 
$5 V. million . Ap-
proximately half of that will 
cover labor costs, the other 
half materials. 

Although this estimate is 
$900,000 higher than the 
initial appraisal , Powers 
tated that A&E has sub-

mi tted sufficient evidence 
to the state, which will 
supply the entire amount, 
to a count for the increase. 

Po wers said that 
projected price increases 
for labor and materials in 
the next 12 months boosted 
the price tag. 

Masonry and carpentry 
workers, who will do most 
of the construction on the 
unit, are currently on strike 
throughout the San Diego 
area . They are asking for a 
13 percent pay increase to 
cover a 16 percent rise in 
the ' cost of ~iving . 

Given a go-ahead by the 
State, A&E will probably 
award the bid within the 
customary 3O-day period, 
Powers stated. With the 
paperwork completed In 
mid-June, construction 
Would be finished in 
December, in time for 
opening at the 1975 fall 
quarter 

At tha t time, Com-
munications, Urban and 
Rural Studies, and Science 
and Technology will open 
offices in Academic Unit I, 
stated Anton Witte, senior 
educational facil ities 
planner . Two remaining 
programs , Third World 
Studies and Teacher 
Education, along with the 
Third College Provost will 
remain officed at Matthews 
campus. For the most part, 
Fourth College will fill the 
space vacated by Third 
College, Witte stated .

Speak ing in a l ive in-
tervIew over campus radio 
station KSDT last Tuesday, 
Chan ce llor M c Elroy ex-
pressed his opposition to 
the proposed plus-minus 
grading system. In addition, 
he said the Triton Times 
Apri I Fools affair is 
"closed" . 

Discussing the grading 
proposal , McElroy said, " I 
certainly wouldn't go for 
it, " adding, " I went through 
this 20 years ago at Johns 
Hopkins. I haven't heard 
any new arguments that 
would convince me that the 
(plus-minus system) is any 
better than the one we have 
now." 

McElroy felt that the

Step II Design Cleated ' 

Regents OK Provosts 
by.Mary Pat Huxiey 

LOS ANGELES- The University of California Regents 
Friday approved the appointments of Morris Friedkin 
and Lea Rudee as provosts of Revelle and Fourth 
Colleges, respectively . In addition, the board rubber-
stamped plans for Slep II of the Student Center and 
Student Affairs facility. 

In other action, UCSD student parking fees were 
raised S12, to S48 per year, the education fee for part-
time students was reduced, and compensations for 
Regent's professors and lecturers were increased . 

The student parking fee incre~ becomes eHective 
on July 1, 1974. S36 per year. 

The reduction in educational fee for part-time 
studt'nts is established at SSO per quarter for a student 
enrolled for less that 9 units of academic credit per 
quarter. The new reduction becomes eHective with the 
Fall Quarter, 1974. The part-time student will now pay 
fees totallinR S162 per quarter instead of S212. The 
reduction is for undergraduates only, as it was con-
sidered too difficult to define the part-time doctoral 
candidate. 

Effective July 1, 1974, the range of stipends for 
Regents' Professors will be increased from the present 
ranRe of S7,OOO to S10,OOO per quarter to a new range of 
S8,OOO to S10,SOO per quarter. Stipend for Regents' 
lectul't'l's Will be increased from a range of S2,OOO to

with five letter grades of A 
to F,)s wholly adequate. 
" To try to differentiate 
much more than that tends 
to lead to artificial types of 
separations." The proposed 
change, recently approved 
by the Committee on 
Educational Policy here, 
would allow the appel)ding 
of a plus or minus to each 
letter grade, with the suffix 
to carry a bonus or penalty 
of one-third of a grade 
point . The Academic 
Senate wi II vote on the 
motion in June. 

On the subject of the 
recent dismissal and 
subsequent reinstatement 
of David Buchbinder as 
editor-in-chief of the Triton 
Times, M cElroy said that as 
far as he is concerned the 
matter is closed . When 
asked whether he was 
embarrassed at having to 
reverse his position after 
V ice-Chan ce llor George 
Murphy admitted having 
m isadvi sed him, M cElroy 
r esponded , " I w asn' t 
embarrassed . ... 1 th ink he 
(Murphy) did as good a job 
as he could .. 1 do think we 
made a m istake in t ry ing to 
solve thi s problem too 
rapidly." 

The chancellor revealed 
that he has asked the 
Regents' legal counsel to 
present the ituation 
directly to the Regents, in 
order to get clarifi cation of 
his authority . McElroy 
expressed his ::>wn con-
clusions regarding editorial 
matters by saying, " I don't 
think the chancellor ha 
any authority, as far as I can 
tell, to remove the editor 
for any cause , except 
possibly for fi sc al 
mismanagemE>nt " 

As a further aftermath of

Any appeals of M urphy's

Hot COpy 
It had been my intention, in attending the Regents 

meeti", in LA last week, to fully immerse myself in the 
Workinl Press Experience. Toward such an end, I had 
decided to: 

Hang around in bars between sessions, drinking dry 
martinis and theorizin. d.uldy about what the Regents 
were considering 111 Executive Session; 

Smualy discuss the juicy items that reporters are 
supposed to come across in the course of their in-
vestigations, but don't print in Order to protect and 
maintain their sources; 

Run into the Press Room, at the first indication of a 
possible story, and yell into a phone, "Get me the deskl 
Dump Page Onel Hot Copyl" and so on; and, 

Generally act like the cynical, urbane, worldly type 
that I thought a reporter was supposed to be. This was, 
after all, a Real Assignment. 

However, after acquiring our 'Triton Times' stickers at 
the entrance to the Press Room, we chanced to look 
around. Instead of the excited, teeming mass I ex-
pected, there was one reporter, from the LA Herald-
Examiner, sitting alone at a long table and gazing 
forlornly at his typewriter, with a deadline in a half-hour 
and nothing to write about. He looked extremely tired 
and not quite. cynical enough. 

So we left the Press Room and went to the main 
entrance of the long room in which the Regents were 
meeting, but were stopped by a guard at a table . 

"You can't go in here unless you're on the list," he 
said. 

We gave him our names, which, of course, were not 
on the list. "Well, how can we get in1" I asked . 

"You can get in, but you have to go to the othEr 
door ." The guard pointed down the hall at a door about 
20 feet away. 

"Where does that door g01" 
"Into the room, obviously," he said, looking away. 
Obediently, we went through the other door, and sat 

down behind a man whose name had been on the list, 
and who had juSt come in the first door. 

During the second session, I spotted the kind of 
reporter I'd been looking for . He had a wrinkled, dirty 
suit, tossled hair, did not wear a name sticker, and had 
the most perfectly cyncial expression I could've 
imagined . I watched him take notes, and tried to 
duplicate myself the short, fluid flips of the wrist. He 
shot occasional. dry looks at the droning Regents . 

·When, later on, he snubbed with a calculated look of 
disdain a reporter from the San Diego Union who tried 
to make a joke about the proceedings, I began to 
pattern my life after him . I eventually discovered that 
he was from the San Francisco Chronicle. 

After Friday's Regents' session, I got an interesting 
look at the working press in action during a news 
conference with gubernatorial candidate Bob Moretti. 
When we walked in, the Candidate was hurriedly 
reading over the pre-prepared press release that 
described, in the past tense, what he was about to say. 
The reporters milling around shot •. .ff-hand comments at 
him : 

"Hey, Bob, why should we cover you with the SLA 
running around town?" 

"What would you say if I told you Brown was going to 
covertly tape your press conference?" 

The Candidate ("I don't care what Brown does") 
smiled at them, and made sure his cigarette was out 
before stepping up to the podium, which was by then 
bathed in television lights . 

Thereafter, the reporters adhered to what had been 
my notion of the way reporters act at press conferences. 
They referred to him as 'Assemblyman Moretti ' and 
asked pointed questions, which , in context, seemed 
.. Imost routine and surprisingly, welcomed by the 
Candidate . And as soon as the lights were off and the 
conference over, the jokes started again, and the 
Candidate became 'Bob' . 

If Moretti's conference was at all a capsulization of 
the press/public figure relationship, I stand reassured . 
Professionalism was maintained when it mattered but 
not at the expense of the 'comfortableness' the pr~ss is 
often CI iticized for . We could hardly expect reporters 
and can~idates, for example, to work together can· 
stantly .. s the adversaries thry'rE' oftE'n judged to be . 

After the conference, in which the Chronicle reporter 
asked c ne question, and asked it just the right way, I 
watched him walk down the hall tp the men's room . 
When ~ , e left olJ"l>lvp.s . I tried to walk with the same 
measur !d stride, but remembered I was flv,.l the Triton 
Times \,/hen I found I'd forgotten where the car was .

Revelle Students to 
Vote This Week 

Revelle students this week will elect their RCCA and 
TUse representatives for next year. From 10 a.m. to 2 
p .m. today, tomorrow and Thursday, ballots may be cast 
at the votin, box in the Revelle plaza, and between 2 
and 4:30 p.m. at the Revelle Provosfs office. 

The ballots are prInted in last Friday's Triton Times,

will vote on two UCSD-wide issues. One is the con-
troversial grading proposal that would allow for plus-
minus grades. The second question on the ballot in-
volves the name of the new student center. The 
possibifities under consideration are Diegeno Hall, 
Torrey Center, and the Triton Union .

The Triton Times feels that the plus 
(+) minus (-) feature of the new grading 
system, proposed by the Committee on 
Educational PolicV (CEP) is disad-
vantageous to the UCSD community. 

This proposal, if passed by the 
Academic Senate in June, will induce 
unnecessary and undue pressure on 
students by creating additional emphasis 
on grades - rather than on learning. 

We believe that the current emphasis 
o n grades is large enough, and needs no 
further amplification as would occur if 
this proposal were passed . 

This proposal, if passed, will provide 
unavoidable and excess work and 
aggravation for all faculty members, 
since there would be more than twice as 
many grades, and con~Pfl"pntlv ~n ' ;n-

• negatIve 
creased number of student complaints. 

We believe that an additional 
workload of this nature should not be 
imposed upon the faculty by the small 
number who usually attend the 
Academic SenatE' meetings. We en-
courage all faculty members to attend 
the Senate meeting, Tuesday, June fourth 
to excercise their vote . 

This proposal will affect all students. 
We encourage, therefore, active par-
ticipation in the CEP/Registrar's student 
poll , taking place during the ne)(t two 
weeks . In addition, we encourage 
students to speak with their professors 
and encourage their attendance at the 
Academic Senate meeting and their 
negative vote on the plus minus feature. 

Mid-East Terror No.1 
Once again the world has been 

shocked by a brutal Mid-East atrocity . 
Rather than react emotionally ' to the 
immediate grisly offense, we feel it best 
to back away and take a long-range view 
of the Middle East Conflict. 

The precipitating cause of the current 
Middle East problems was the genocidal 
An ti-Semitism of Nazi Germany . Millions 
of Jews who managed to survive the 
holocaust found themselves homeless, 
impoverished and in need of refuge. 
Under such circumstances, one would 
have thought it reasonable of the United 
States to live up to the motto of its Statue 
of liberty and allow a massive wave of 
immigration . But to advocate such a 
c ourse of action was politically 
dangerous. since it was opposed by labor 
unions and anti-semitic sentiment. There 
was an easier way out. 

The Zionist movement demanded a 
Jewish nationa.1 homeland in Palestine . 
Some Zionists believed that Jews had a 
God-given right to a Palestinian nation 
state . The United Nations (a puppet of 
the Big Five) thus conceived a "humane" 
solution to the "Jewish problem" : accede 
to Zionist demands and create the State 
of Israel. The Palestinian Arabs had no 
elf-determination ; they were not 

allowed to establish their own im· 
migration quotas . When the immigration 
did come, the Arabs felt threatened. and 
gueri lla warfare broke out, with atrocitie~ 
committed on both sides . Many of the 
Jewish founders of Israel no doubt had 
hoped and believed that Arab and lew 

would live peacefully in Israel and the 
Mid-East, but their hopes were cruelly 
blasted . 

They key to the fatal tragedy of the 
Mid-East was the establishment of Israel. 
This should never have taken place 
without the democratic consent of the 
native peoples of Palestine. Israel came 
into being because of the hypocracy and 
imperialist prerogative of the Western 
Powers . But given that it was established, 
it is heartless to blame dispossessed and 
persecuted Jews for moving there, or to 
blame the Arabs for resenting the in-
trusion . 

We hope that everyone will recognize 
the complex nature of this tragedy . We 
expecial'y hope that the Arabs and 
Israelis will come to recognize that 
neither party is the absolute villain, and 
will open themselves to understanding 
and compromise . For a table Mid-East 
peace, we believe that several c om-
promises are absolutely essential. The 
Arab states must formally recognize the 
ex istence of Israel , offer guarantees for 
its security (including perhaps a U. N. 
buffer zone), and suppress the vicious 
guerilla terrorist movements that now 
find refuge within their borders. In turn, 
Israel should be willing to make 
~ignifi cant territorial concessions to the 
Arabs, and join with Arab states in im-
pi menting social programs to better the 
miserable lot of the Palestinian refugees . 
We pray that Secretary of State Kissinger 
is doing all' that he ran to promote such a 
resolution . 

Mid-East Terror No.2 
Israel continued its policy of not giving 

in to blackmail at the sacrifice of tens of 
c hildren . As if to compensate for this 
doubtful action, the Israeli government 
then performed the ine)(cusable act 
(again) of bombing the villages of the 
Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, whose 
plight they are partly responsible for . 
This sort of action does nothing to 
promote Israel's positon . While the 
terrorists act as misguided (and 
reprehensible) individuals, the bombings 
in lebanon are official acts of a govern-
ment. The terrorists are counter-
revolutionary, and hurt their own cause, 

but any child can realize that the Israeli 
government is participating in organr zed 
murder. It is ironic .that they have even 
borrowed the disgusting phrases of the 
U.S. war machine. and called their raid a 
retal i ation . 

The 1 riton Times calls on Israel to 
come to grips with reality, and deal with 
the Palestinian issue in a sincere, 
responsible way. Israel is behind the 
times . Expansionist policies are passe; 
neocolonialism is the order of the day. 
let Israel learn the lesson of Portugal and 
fall into line.

osteopathy which I would 
like to correct. 

There are two types of

and M.O.'s both utilize all 
scientifically acc~pted 
methods of -diaanosis and

difference is that the D.O. 
receives additional trainlna

Crawling Eye Report 

Who Killed William Knowland? 
A great deal of suspicion 

surrounds the February 23 
death of William Knowland, 
editor and publisher of 
The Oakland Tribune . 
Reporters and other 
political watchdogs. who 
don't necessarily have a 
conspiratorial axe to grind, 
are confounded by what 
appears to be an official 
blackout of vita l 
background information in 
the case. We should be 
suspicious here because 
Knowland was a key press 
figure in the SlA matter and 
the circumstances of his 
death are mysterious in a 
way that is familiar to 
conspiracy researchers . 

Knowland's body was 
recovered either on the 
banks of or in the flood-
swollen Russian River (t here 
are conflicting accounts on 
the recovery of the body) 
behind his home in Monte 
Rio . A search for him had 
been touched off when he 
failed to keep an ap-
pointment, the nature of 
which has not been 
disclosed (L.A. Free Press, 4-
5-74, p.3). The Sonoma 
County sheriffs office 
immediately termed the 
death a suicide althoug'h no 
suicide note was found 
(N .Y. Times, 2-24-74, p.1 & 
53; 2-25-74, p.30) They did 
not immediately release 
information on the nature 
of the wound or the weapon 
used (N .Y.Times, 2-24-74, p . 
53). 

ThQ day after the in-
cident, sheriff's spokesmen 
reported that an autopsy 
showed that Knowland 
"killed himself yesterday 
with a single .32-calibre 
bullet in the head" (NYT, 2-
25-74, p. 30) . "We have 
definitely ruled out foul 
play," said Under-Sheriff 
Robert Hayes (Ibid.) There 
has been no official 

comment on the reason or 
manner of the suicide-a 
response an l.A. Free Press 
reporter terms "deafeningly 
si lent" (4-5-74, p. 3). 

How does an autopsy 
demonstrate that a gunshot 
wound was self-inflicted? 
Anybody can hold a gun to 
someone's head . How was 
foul play ruled out? Nobody 
will say . 

No one knows why 
Knowland would kill -
himself. Those closest to 
him are baffled as to the 

reason and call SUlticil ' /lut -
of-character for the mtln 
(Ibi d . ) His mood was 
described as "e bullient " 
two days earlier during a 
Tribune 100th birthday 
celebration at which he 
optimistically discussed 
plans for the paper's growth 
(NYT, 2-24-74, p . 53) . There 
is no evidence of ill health 
or personal problems (L .A 
Free Press, loc . cit .)

The Visual Arts 

Musical Notes! Department will sponsor a lecture by art critic Max KozloH on Thursday, May 
23. The title of the lecture 
will be "Moral Con-
sciousness in 20th Century 
Art ." Kozloff has been the 
art critic for The Nation and 
the New York correspon-
dent for Art International. 
He is currently a con-
tributing editor for Art-
forum and has written a 
major book on the artist 
Jasper Johns. ' 

LOOKING THROUGH-
Pusport. Atco Records. 

More and more so, in-
novative European bands 
are finding their way to the 
American market. And 
strangely enough, the 
suspected stereotypes are 
not there at all. One would 
suspect for e~ample, that a 
German band would be 
playing heavy, oppressive, 
and weighty music, but 
looking at Passpott, an 
e~citing German rock-jazz 
band we find this to be 
untrue in spades! 

What makes this group's 
material so exciting, is a 
fle~ible and talented 
quartet of musicians. Two 
keyboard artists, one of 
which" doubles on 
saxophone as well as an 
electronic and acoustic 
percussionist, along with a 
bassist-guitarist. What is so 
interesting here, is the 
number of musical com-
binations that can be made 
with two keyboards in this 
day and age of mellotrons, 

moogs, and electronics . 
This allows for a beautiful 

blend of mellotron 
background with moog 
soloing over it; as the band 
runs through some standard 
and some modestly 
progressive jazz-rock 
numbers. 

Most of the album runs 
relatively mellow, but the 
allowance for high tempo 
and strong d',mamics shows 
itself often. The opening 
cut " Eternal Spiral" is a 
marvelous blues variation 
with imaginative use of 
synthesizers to embellish 
and stand in the foreground 
as well. 

For the ear keenly at-
tracted to the new electric 
keyboard sounds, " Looking 
Through" is a fine, fine 
musical set. 

QUiirter Notes 
Well, the first "Kiss" 

Endurance contest was held 
a couple of weeks ago in Ft. 
Lauderdale, as promotion 
for "Kiss" (who will be 

appearing at the Sports 
Arena May 30 incidently), 
and fourteen more kiss-
contests are beinll held as 
well! 

The Ft . Lauderdale 
winners set the new world 
kissing endurance record of 
96 hours, 32 minutes and 
(gasp) 6 seconds I Winners 
of the heats (no pun in-
tended) in the fourteen 
other contests, will join the 
Ft. Lauderdale winners in 
the final "Great Kiss Off" on 
May 25 in Chicago, for the 
final marathon . Winners 
wi II receive an eight day 
cruise to Acalpulco. 

Jim Dandy, lead singer 
for Black Oak Arkansas, is

Angeles. The completed 
sculpture will be presented 
to Britain's National Gallery 
for its permanent collection 
when the group arrives in 
London in mid-May.

maiden who represents the Christian

Musical Notes! 

The program features the UCSD 
Chamber Singers in Bach 's Motet No. 6 
"Lobet den Herrn, Aile Heiden, ." This 
work will be followed by SPRING by 
Antonio Vivaldi, with Joan Sturman, 
violin, solOist, and the UCSD Chamber 
Orchestra. 

CONCERTO IN C MINOR by Bach, 
with Eugene Gratovich, violin, Hugh 
Matheny, oboe, Thomas Nee guest 
conductor and the UCSD Chamber 
Orchestra and Bach's dramatic CAN-
T A T A NO. 140 wi II also be presented . 
The work is based on the hymn, "Wachet 
Auf," composed a century earlier by 
Phillip Nicolai . The text of the hymn is 
based on the biblical parable of the Ten 
Virgins in which Christ is represented as 
the he:lVen ly bridegroom to be Wf'rl to a 

The chorale its~lf-known by heart by 
members of the congregation in Bach 's 
day- is presented forthrightly in three 
choral movements . The remaining 
recitatives and duets are derived from 
the story with emphasis on the human, 
sensual qualities of the allegory. Thus, 
Bach combined the familiarity of a 
popular chorale with heightened 
dramatic effects to give immediacy to 
this musical portion of the church ser-
vice. 

David Chase, director, has had e~­
perience conducting with numerous 
chora l groups in the East. Thomas Nee is 
musical director of the La Jolla 
Civic/University Symphony and the New 
Hampshire Summer Festival. All the 
performers have appeared in recitals in 
major music centers on both the East and 
West coasts.

Final UCSD Theatre Production 
"No Place to be Somebody," the fourth and final 

production of the 1973-74 drama season at UCSD, will 
open Friday, May 24 for eight performances. 

The production will be directed by Dr. Floyd Gaffney, 
UCSD associate professor of drama, and will be 
presented in the UCSD Theatre on the Matthews 
campus. 

Performances will be at 8 p.m May 24-26, 29-31 and 
June 1-2. Gaffney advises that it is not a play for 
children to see because of the street language used and 
the raw emotions displayed by the characters . 

Charles Godone's " No Place to be Somebody" was 
awarded the 1970 Pulitzer Prize . The play was first 
performed at the Sheridan Square Playhouse in 1967 
and went on to successful runs at the New York 
Shakespeare Festival Public Theater and the Promenade 
Theater in New York . _ 

Scene of the production is a bar in an integrated 
neighborhood on the west side of Greenwich Village. 
Johnny Williams, owner of the bar, was involved with a 
black racketeer early in life and identifies with him as a 
father image. Johnny gets involved with the rackets in 
an attempt to gai n power. He meets a liberal white girl 
who is the daughter of a former Mafia lawyer and uses 
her to help him get information to blackmail the Mafia . 
In the violent finale, Johnny, his mentor (the racketeer) , 
and Mafia men are killed . 

Gaffney, who specializes in black drama and dance, 
said that although the surface action suggests a black 
militant melodrama, the play is not just about blacks 
and whites. " It's a study in human desires, behavior and 
responses to their political, social and economic en-
vironment," he explained . The title "No Place to be 
Somebody" suggests a philosophy of people who for a

number of reasons, both soc ial and emotional, have 
difficu lty reali zing their full potential as citizens and 
human beings. They can 't express themselves as in-
dividuals and can't pull themselves out of the squalor in 
which th ey live." According to Gaffney, Johnny sym-
bolizes those negative elements in American society 
which are in conflict with systems of ethics and morality 
of the mainstream . 

The play, like many other contemporary dramas, 
emphasizes the human suffering that's been the fate of 
blacks for over 300 years, Gaffney said . It shows men 
struggling desperately to gain control of their lives in a 
world that tends to forget them, he said. 

Speaking of American university theatre in general, 
(Gaffney considers Third College an exception within 
the academic institutional structure), he said that most 
universities produce traditional plays which give few 
opportunities for black actors . 

Gaffney has selected a cast of 16 UCSD students and 
community actors from throughout San Diego. Gary 
Morton, UCSD sophomore, has the lead role of Johnny 
and his girl friend is played by Heidi Nickerson, a UCSD 
junior. 

Serving as assistant director is Melvin Johnson , a 
student at San Diego State University . 

Daniel Dryden, UCSD assistant professor of drama, 
designed the four- level set. Spatial in concept, it 
uggests that the scene represents a microcosm of 

what's happening in the larger world outside. 
Musical director is Dr. Eddie Meadows, of San Diego 

- State University, who will conduct a four-piece band of 
San Diego musicians. Accompanying the group will be 
singer Patricia Roberts, a UCSD junior . 

Admission is 52 .50 for the general public and S1.25 
for students . Tickets are available at the Drama 
Department, Bldg. 203 Matthews, or at the box office in 
the new Student Center .

SELECTED JO(;KS 
A week and half ago theSelected Jocks Staff awarded 

a " framed copy of the newly enshrined Selected Jocks 
emblem" to Lee Johnson for his support of the Sl Staff. 
Upon learning about this dubious award Johnson was 
inquisitive as to the origin of our distinguished emblem . 
So herewith the history of this cla,,,i c insignia. 

To be exact there are three prevalent theories as to 
how the emblem came about, some of them plausible 
and some not. 

The first theory goes deep into ancient history as it is 
rumored that an intrepid spelunker found the graphic 
imprinted on a side wall deep in "Les Caves des France." 
Along with the hieroglyphic, which we have since 
deciphered to read "Ies Jacques selecte," there was 
found an inscription that possibly revealed the true 
identity of the artist. It read "Fruit of the Loom, H. The 
Mouth, c."

Due to lack of information and incomplete research 
the SJ Staff cannot officially reveal the source of the 
second theory as to the origin of our insignia . Presently 
the nation's Chief Selected lock has refused to comply 
with our subpoenas for relevant information. Once the 
(characterization deleted) turns · over the necessary 
documents we will be able to give you, our reader, the 
results of our investigation . 

Un Ie,s otherwise noted, all events ~ be ilelCl on the \JCSD Soocer Field. 

The third, and most plausible, theory as to the history 
of theSJ logo is that the SJ staff decided to pull down the

"But certainly everyone

We have no answer for 
that, other than cowardice 
and apathy : a lack of love, 
if you will. It saddens us to 
think that our first social 
comment is about such a 
traditionally Christian 
whipping-post as "sex." It 
saddens us to think that we 
waited so long to find the 
courage to sf)E'ak . Be that as 
it may, we hope and pray 
that this will not be the last

want Knowland dead, well. 
I have an idea. Knowland. a 
political conservative, was 
concerned about the failure 
of police to apprehend 
suspects for the slaying of 
Oakland school superin-
tendent Marcus Foster. On 
January 10, he ran a signed 
editorial on the front page 
of The Oakland Tribune 
demanding that the police 
and DA " reassure the law-
abiding people of this 
community that every step 
has and wi II be taken to 
bring the perpetrators of 
this evil deed to justice." He 
offered a 510,000 reward for 
information leading to the 

a"est and conviction of 
Foster's killers (NYT, 2-24-
74, p_ 53) . Quite Simply, my 
speculation is that 
Knowland, either through 
his own zeal or press 
sources or because his 
reward offer finally paved 
off, accidentally stumbled 
on the fact that the SlA, 
which had claimed credit 
for the Foster slaying, was a 
government front 
organization . He could not 
then be allowed to live with 
that information. 

It is interesting to note 
that Joe Rem iro and Russ 
little were arrested within a 
day after Knowland's 
editorial hit the tands . Was 
this a government attempt 
to cut off Knowland's 
personal investigation 
before it really got un-
derway? 

Next installment---an 
historical context : the 
"suicide" of Maryland 
congressman William Mills; 
a San Quentin escape story,

The marketing research specialists who gave 
America the Datsun automobiles (260Z, 8-210, 610, 
510, Lil Hustler truck. etc.) have determined that 16" 
of the 8,000,000 college students in this country will 
buy a new or used car within the next year. 

Using a slide-rule and sheer blind luck, we 
figured that equals 8,160 persons of the 51 ,000 in 
San Diego's university communities. 

So we figured we'd talk to you brieny and 
clearly: at Terry Allen Datsun in EI Cajon (EI Cajon 
Boulevard at Marshall just off the freeway from 
whence you can see our sign on a clear day) we be-
lieve that people involved in education (getting or 
giving) deserve more than a hearty slap on the back 
and "well done" and all that other stuff. We believe 
that the break you'U be giving all of us by getting 
an education is worth a break to you right now on a 
new or used automobile. 

We'd like to prove It to you. 
With special financing to students. With spe-

cial deals for students. With special care of students 
and faculty alike. 

Now's the time. You'll probably be working 
this summer, so that'll give you good credit. 

So drop by Terry Allen Datsun. For a new 
Datsun or a used economy car of any make or model. 

It's worth a lot more than a slap on the back.

Barrett said . They will be 
constructed at an estimated 
$430,000. 

Barrett also stated that 
UCSD will be applying for ' 
additional financial support 
for the construction of the 
Third College Housing unit 
from a Regent's Equity 
Fund. It will cover 30 
percent ($690,000) of the 
total cost. This would be 
the first time UCSD has 
so ught money via this 
avenue. Barrett said that UC 
campuses at Irvine and 
Santa Cruz have already 
requested money from this 
source . 

Barrett said that he is "99

By that time, UCSD will 
have a total enrollment of 
an estimated 6,000. But this 
figure is expected to be 
upped to 10,000 this year,
