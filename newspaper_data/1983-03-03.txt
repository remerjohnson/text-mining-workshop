Ireland under wraps

Guardian; What is the basis 
for your protest of the Queen's 
visit? 
Walsh: The British govern-
ment is responsible for the 
problems that are currently 
taking place in the part of the 
world that is called Northern 
Ireland. The Queen of England 
is the titular head of the 
government of England as weI I 
as the sovereign represent-
ative of Great Britain and the 
United Kingdom . In her 
capacity as repre entative of 
the British people, she is 
making a state visit to the 
United States of America 
which happens to have 
somew here between 30 and 40 
million people of Irish 
ancestry. Many of whom are 
devoutly upset with the 
manner in which England has 
been running things in 
Ireland, and we are taking this 
opportunity to express our 
deep feelings about this issue. 
Guardian: What are you 
setting out to accomplish at 
the rally? 
Walsh: I expect the rally to 
accomplish a few things. First 
and foremost, there will be a 
certain recognition on the part 
of the British government and 
the Queen directly, that 
wherever she goes she 
encounters Iri sh-American 
opposition largely on the 
grounds of the illegal 
occupation of Ireland. 
Guardian: What do you want 
the demonstration to say or 
prove to the general public? 
Walsh: The demonstrations 
like this one prove that, A) we 
are not merely just a bunch of 
cranks, B) and its opposition is 
not restricted to one spot in 
one part of the world. 
Wherever the Queen of 
England goes whether it is 
Chicago, New York. Boston, 

people only to detain them 
illegally and hold Kangaroo 
courts where no concept of due 
process occurs. Also, the 
second purpose is not only to 
educate the Queen of England 
as to the growing opposition 
amongst Irish-Americans, but 
it's also to bring to attention of 
some of our fellow Americans 
who are not of Irish descent, 
about a problem if they knew 
the facts, they would be 
equally outraged. 

Guardian: The civil rights 
movement in Ireland began in 
August 1968 based upon 
Martin Luther King 's 
successful activities in the 
(American) south. The Roman 
Catholic community was 
being discriminated against in 
housing, jobs and other 
economical and educational 
activities. Wasn't this event 
the first sequence in many 
protest marches that led to 
what is referred to today as 
"Bloody Sunday?" 
Walsh: Yes. What happened 
was police forces began 
repressing them (the Irish 
people) with dogs, and violent 
attacks , so the British 
government sent in troops to 
maintain the order that had 
previously been in existence. 
So during a civil rights march 
in January 1972, English 
paratroopers commanded by 
Lt. Col. Derek Wilford opened 
fire without provocation on a 
group of civil rights marchers, 
killing 13 of them while 
wounding a number of others. 
Lord Chief Justice Woodgery 
(who was the high chief justice 
of the legal system of England 
- the equivalent of Warren 
Burger of our Supreme Court) 
conducted an inque t. The 
result of his inquest was that 
these people were unarmed 
and were not engaged in any 

provocative activity. He went 
on, however, to find out that 
because of the circumstances 
there was no blame to be had. 
In any event, it wa a very 
similar situation to the Cale 
massacres in Mili , Son-Ii 
massacres in Vietnam. Only 
13 people were killed in Ireland 
as opposed to 101 in Vietnam, 
but the point we raise here i 
that unlike Lt. Cale who went 
to prison for his'crime, Lt. Col. 
Wilford received a knighthood. 
We feel as Americans, and 
Irish-Americans, that this is 
the kind of outrage that should 
be brought to the attention of 
the world. 
Guardian: What could the 
Queen of England do about it? 
Walsh: When the Queen of 
England had an opportunity to 
do something about it, she 
didn't refrain from doing 
anything, she went and did 
something positively immoral. 
Let me ask you a question. 
Let 's suppose the French 
government, after Barbey wa 
brought back from Bolivia 
instead of putting him on trial, 
made him a member of the 
order of the bathe. Don 't you 
think someone would say, 
"Hey, wait a minute. Just 

because those instances 
happened 40 years ago, you 
don't reward somebody for 
that?" This man murdered 13 
Irish citizen who were merely 
protesting diSCrimination in 
their own country (rai ing hi 
voice) they can't vote, they 
can't get decent housing, they 
don't even have acce, s to jobs, 
their ons and daughters can't 
go to universities on equal 
footing with Prote tants, and 
they're born m their own 
country. Foreign troop come 
in and shoot them on their own 
soil and the guy who d~ it 
i n't censured, i n't given a 
slap on the wrist, doe n't go to 
prison , he becomes a member 
of the peerage. I think that I 
cause for concern, and any 
person who i fair-minded has 
to be a little worried. 

Guardian: You have spoken 
out against monarchy in the 
past, do you stdl feel that way? 
If so, you must re ent the 
Queen' vi it. 
Walsh: Here we have the 
Queen of England, pending 
God knows how much of our 
taxpayers' money. I under-
tand that they have called up 

a reserve company of Marine 

to help With ~ecurlty, It s 
going to cost the city of an 
Diego x number of dollars In 
overtime for the poltce 
department JU t to provide 
security for thl woman who I 
gomg to go to the finest 
re taurants, luxury this and 
luxury that, and we're a 
country who rejected 
monarchy 200 year ago. Here 
we have our officials bowing 
and scraping to the Queen of 
England for what? I don't 
under tand it, and I dont 
thmk the average American 
under tand either. I think 
some of u are a little bit fed up 
with thl fawning over British 
royalty, particularly when the 
royalty doe something hke 
bestow a knighthood on Derek 
Wilford. 
Guardian: If you have the 
opportumty to speak to the 
Queen what Will you ay? 
Walsh: I would ay, "I hope 
you have a mce tlme m San 
Diego, Your Highnes . but 
please do omething to take

No. Ireland ' s courts: 
mili~aristi~, non-jury 

As Amencans, we are disturbed at the inhumane 
treatment by the British army on Northern Ireland. 
As official head of the Judicial System and Her 
Majesty's Forces, Queen Elizabeth II has not 
condemned the unprincipled and murderous actions 
being taken by these branches of her government 
against the people of Northern Ireland, In fact 
Elizabeth II has condoned and decorated English 
violence and terror. 

The queen knighted the commanding officer of the 
Parachute Regiment, Lt. Col. Derke Wilford of 
"Bloody Sunday infamy." His orders led to' the 
shooting of thirteen peaceful civil rights marchers in 
Derry Ireland on January 30, 1972, 

The Queen's courts in Northern Ireland are 
militaristic non-jury trials that run counter to all 
other democratic judicial systems of the civilized 
world. Why else would the Queen bestow' knighthood 
on Wilford after most governments would have locked 
him up and thrown away the key. 

Assassination squads within the British army are 
responsible for ten deaths between October and 
December of last year. These victims were civilized 
non-combatant individuals. 

The fact that 80 percent of Ireland voted for 
independence in 1918, is the only true national 
plebiscite, indicates that the democratic wishes of the 
Irish people have been ignored. Until such time as her 
Majesty's government shows a willingness to 
recogm.ze the democratic wishes of the Irish people, 
the Umted States should make a clear, firm demand 
that England give up its maintanence of Ireland as a 
colonial statehood.

Editor: 

Assemblywoman Sunny 
("Little Dictator") Mojon· 
nier's comment that she had 
not had "one piece of mail" 
telling her that her constitu · 
ents favor raising taxes to 
maintain services (especially 
education) grieves me very 
much. Postcards are obviously 
too informal for her. I do not 
believe Ms. Mojonnier should 
be deprived any longer. I urge 
all UCSD students and 
faculty. who care deeply about 
our education and Ms. 
Mojonnier's mail sack, to 
write Sunny and tell her that 
she has a const ituency to raise 
taxe:; and solve our budgetary

Letter writers should know 
about scientific evolution 
Editor: 

Eight persons, at last count, 
have written replies to the 
letter "Striking Out at the 
Validity of the Bible," by Mr. 
james Harvey johnson, 
published by the Guardian 
Feb. 3. For many years Mr. 
Johnson has been encouraging 
people to look critically at the 
Bible, and his approach is 
rather blunt: he outlines some 
of the stories which would 
seem to challenge anyone's 
sense of the plausible. and 
then suggests that the rna t 
reasonable conclusion is that 
the book is a collection of 
human myths, fabrications 
similar to the morality storie 
of Aesop or Hans Christian 
Anderson. 

As a whole. the published 
responses would seem to show 
that faith is alive and well at 
UCSD. The health of science, 
however, seems to be less 
certain. It is amazing that so 
many students at a major 
research university do not 
even understand what science 
is! 

Let me, too, be blunt : 
Religion (at least in its 
"fundamentalist" form, the 
belief in an omnipotent 
personal creator which works 
miracles) is incompatible with 
science. Science does not 
"disprove" uch a belief; it is 
simply and radically incompa· 
tible with it. Anyone who 
values science as a method or 
as a world view, and also 
retain a belief in such a "god" 
can do so only by utilizing a 
form of self·deception in which 
the two belief systems are 
employed selectively. and by 
making no attempt to achieve 
intellectual coherence. 

It is quite true that science 
has developed in the Western 
world in close association with 

Christian metaphysics - but 
it has done so as a reaction to 
the Christian world view. not 
as a natural outgrowth of it. 
Charles Madder (Guardian, 
Feb. 10) names Galileo, 
Newton, and Einstein as 
"serious thinkers and 
researchers" who may 
nevertheless have found the 
Bible (or at least some form of 
religion) worthy of belief. He 
does not mention that 
Galilco's faith led him to 
Rome, where his work was 
suppressed by the Church; 
that Newton ended his days 
wallowing in mysticism and 
occult alchemy; and that 
Einstein drifted away from his 
colleagues, rejecting quantum 
phYSICS for reasons of 
metaphysical faith . 

The incompatibility of 
scie nce and religion is 
documented quite well by the 
letters to the Guardian of the 
last few weeks: 

- Krista Keiger (Feb. 7): 
"Faith in God surpasses all 
human reason and under-
standing." 

- james Papp (Feb. 10): 
..... scientific fact is God's 
anyway. and hecandowhat he 
likes with it... .. 

- Roger W. Johnson (Feb. 
10): .... . shouldn·t He (God) be 
able to temporarily suspend or 
otherwise these laws (sic) at 
His whim'" 

- Gary Lee (Feb. 14): ... .. is it 
impos ible or illegal for him to 
suspend or change those laws 
as he sees fit?" 

- Bruce Hamilton (Feb. 14): 
"Bear in mind also that 
anything is possible for an 
omnipotent God." 

- Finally. Phil Robinson 
(Feb. 22) brings in the entire 
"creation science" story, 
complete with its non-existent 
"model." thermodynamic

maklOg and vacuousness . 
Fortunately we are sti ll free 
from organized football. but 
fraternities and sororities are 
here, and we either have to 
reconcile ourselves to them. or 
think of sufficient reason to 
get rid of them, or ideally, 
decide how they can be a 
constructive influence on 
UCSD. 

This is one of those 
underground investigative 
articles that are supposed to 
win Pulitzer prizes . With 
journalistic zeal overcoming 
my prudence I penetrated a 
fraternity in Berkeley, Nu 
Colony of Alpha Sigma Phi, in 
the best tradit ion of reporters 
going where they are not 
invited . In this case. however. 
[ received a confirmation from 
a friend of an invitation I had 
extended to myself. 

When 1 arrived In the 
evening [ was expecting. not 
unwillingly. the usual 
debauchery that. one 
imagines. goes on in a 
fraternity house every night. 
To my surprise. and not 
entirely to my disappoint· 
ment, the orgia tic tendencies 
seemed to manifest them· 
selves in playng Scrabble to a 
late hour. with accompany!ng 

misinterpretations, proba-
bility arguments which give 
no s tated premises, semantic 
nonsense about "missing 
links." and misq uotes from 
evol ut ion ists. 

All of the 'e writers need 
some remedial education . 
They should have learned in 
high school or earlier that the 
"laws of science" are not 
God's, but man's. They are 
human construct ions which 
codify and summarize a host of 
human obsen:ations andgi\'e a 
humall interpretation of 
nature. These writers should 
know that science is nol 
merely descriptive, as Gary 
Lee asserts; it is also predictive 
and unifying, by means of Its 
!-,rrand theories. These theories 

milk and cookies. Nor was thIS 
Scrabble game of a mean 
intellectual level. which will 
be apparent when J tell you 
that my last word made over 
thirty points, and I finished 
amiserable last of four. 

The fraternity is. a' base, 
fraternal, and what can be 
built upon that base is a 
structure of wastmg time on 
mindless pranks. Ignonng the 
peace and comfort of other 
people. and. at worst. 
dest ructiveness; or a st ruct ure 
de velopi ng man as an 
intellectual and social animal 
can be built. Rarely, perhaps 
never , is the second possibility 
unmixed with the first. For 
instance, it is traditional for 
fraternities to have some sort 
of 'hazing' rite, an intellectu· 
ally and socially inexplicable 
practice that can be merely 
fatuou s, or dangerous. 

Even a house which ha 
pride and interest in the 
education of its members. 
which the one I visited does, 
justifIably. have, cannot 
prevent the urge of the social 
animal to take o\er from the 
studious one. Games of 
Dungeons and Dragons (yes, 
Virginia. there IS still a 
dungeon master) can loom 
importantly the day before a 
final or midterm. On the other

bane of editorial columnist. 
television and books can do the 
same. But television is rarely 
as interesting as real people. 
and who reads books these 
days? 

Of sororities I know less.

observations and have the 
highest associated probabilit y

As a theory. the "God

110 associa ted proba bi Ii t y of 
giving correct predictions, 
si nce any events can be said to

"mystenous ways" of God. 

The letter from Mr. Lee IS 
espeCially disappointing. The

would not swear to thiS if 
pressed. The questIOn one ha" 
to answer IS whether thbe 
conditIOns prevailed before the 
young women Jomed sorori· 
ties , or if they developed as a 
result. No doubt they were 
that way before. and the 
sorority merely aggravated the 
case. Going to a university is 
supposed to be an expanding 
and enlightening experience, 
but this sort of society only 
narrows one toone's own kind .

prevails. and till only a few

there is nothing to guarantee 
thiS development, or to

Fraternitites and sororities 
have become memb rs of the 
academic organization UCSD. 
To protect its quality, 
reputation, and comfort, 
UCSD should weave the 
st rictest rules possi ble around 
what have proven themselves 
Jonahs at other universities. 
We should also use the 
strictest rules because they 
have, at other univerSIties, 
proven themselves to be good 
influences at their best. But 
the university can only cont rol 
with dIscipline the external 
actions of the. ocieties, what 
affect other people. The 
internal activity, or lack of it, 
is a matter left to the 
organizers and members. 
Although it affects the whole 
academic community, the 
community can at the end only 
hope that the fraternity or 
sorority has a sen e of its 

ocial, intellectual. and 
educational effect - and thus 
responsibility.

demands the ethical commit·

honesty not onl y of those who

Britain in Ireland 
continued from pag~' 1 
they want to live in an Ireland 
that happens to be united and 
free ." I don't think there is 
anything wrong with saying 
that, but in England it is illegal 
for me to talk like this. But 
that is why we fought the 
Amencan Revolution, isn 't it? 
Guardian: One of your points 
in your opening statement was 
the "necessIty of American 
mfluence In achieving a just 
peace in Ireland." Are you 
saying that if the Queen gets 
her feathers ruffled a bit, that 
might help with the cause? 
Walsh: (Pause) If you recall , 
the relationship between the 
United States and England is 
very close. We are often 
referred to by non·English 
speaking countries as "Anglo-
Saxon powers." The United 
States has been very 
supportive of England, a very 
good example of this is the 
controversy of the Falkland 
Islands war. If you recall, 
Secretary of State Alexander 
Haig in fact resigned largely 
because of his disagreement 
with an Irish·American, a 
brilliant Irish-American, Jean 
Ki r kpatrick, She was our 
ambassador of the United 
Nations and she fe lt very 
strongly that America's best 
interest lay with Argentina, a 
fellow American country, and 
that we shouldn't have 
supported a colonial European 
country in the Western 
Hemispht:re in violation of the 
Monroe Doctrine. To make a 
lung story 5hort, KIrkpatrick 
had a little bIt of influence. and 
the English were very upset 
that the Umted States didn 't 
go to bat for England as much 
as they had wanted, and as you 
recall, Secretary of State 
Alexander Haig stepped down 
over the crisis. That is an 
indicatIOn of the kind of 
influence in power in which 
the United States State 
Department and our govern-
ment can have upon the 
Engli h. I believe that if the 
President of the United States 
said to Prime Minister 
Margaret Thatcher tomorrow, 
"Mr5. Thatcher, please. 
Northern Ireland is an 
embarrassment to the 
Western Democracies. Clean 
up that wretched little 

statelet . give the Irish their 
freedom. Don 't embarrass us 
anymore." The British would 
be In a tough way economically 
to ignore that because the 
United States provides them 
wit h a great deal of economic 
and military aid without 
which they would be in dire 
straights. So all I'm saying, 
and I think all fair-minded 
Americans are savin~ is we 
would like to have a little bit of 
influence on our allies when 
they are doing something 
wrong. God knows they 
criticized us for Vietnam, 
British papers were running 
full-blown that American boys 
were dying every day in 
Vietnam. They weren't lifting 
a finger to help us, but they 
had plenty to say in the 
London Times and Daily 
Telegraph about how immoral 
we are. Now here is an 
opportunity for us to return 
the favor and ask them what 
they are doing to clean up the 
mess that they have created in 
Ireland. 
Guardia n: There have been 
stories, horror stories, about 
British security forces killing 
children. How does the rest of 
Europe feel about this and 
England's occupation in 
Northern Ireland? 

During the climax of the season's worst rainstorm, a group of students went ber8erk on Muir 
Quad Tuesday, attacking one another with sodden Topsiders and screaming, "Death to 
polyester." 

Wals h : Today, in France, the 
coverage of Ireland is 
extremely widespread and the 
French are very very upset 
about these instances where 
children have been shot by the 
British security forces. Much 
of this is the result of an utter 
lack of care by the British 
security forces. They are 
firing into crowds, they are 
using these plastic rubber 
bullet s which are supposed to 
be non-lethal , like (sarcastic, 
ally) tear gas is non-lethal. 
They are used to break up 
demonstration , but what has 
happened is that there have 
been about 20 fatalities, 
mostly children, women, etc. 
Well, the European Commis-
sion on Human Rights has 
been awareofthis by a number 
of complaints. (Whispering) 
One of the complamts was 
brought by the Irish 
government against the 
United Kingdom; it resulted in 
] 979 in a finding by the 
European Commission that 

CONSIDERING A LAW CAREER? 

the British were violative of 
the European Charter of 
Human Rights. This was 
covered on page A-33 in the 
New York Times. Now had that 
been any other country,] think 
it would have gotten a little bit 
more prominant coverage than 
A-33. Can you imagine if the 
United States had been found 
guilty of human rights abuse 
by the World Court in VIetnam 
and the coverage of such be 
found in A-33 of the New York 
Times? The French newsppaer 
Le Monde called it "an 
extraordinary double standard 
when it comes to Ireland ." 
From the French point of view, 
Americans don't cover Ireland 
because we are pro·English . 
Guardian: Do you see that 
trend changing at all? 
Wals h: These kind of things 
are slowly changing. Slowly, 
but they are changing! 
Instances like jhis (where 
people are becoming aware) 
are being repeated across the 
country and across the globe, 
and the cumulative effect of 
this is what I want : for people 
to ask questions. If what this 
red-headed guy is saying is

Ireland. •• 
continued from palle 5 
true, why haven't I heard 
about it? Maybe I'll get an 
investigative reporter to find 
out if this guy is telling the 
truth. Somebody will have a 
Pulitzer prize on their hand 
when the ultimate book is 
written. But it is changing, 
and with personal experience, 
I can say that the interest in 
every aspect of what is taking 
place in Northern Ireland is 
much greater today than it 
was in 1971. 
Guardian: Past history has 
always shown America 
backing up and supporting 
England in almost every 
capacity. What makes you 
think that it would suddenly 
stop supporting England on 
this issue over Ireland? 
Walsh: The surprising thing 
about it is that the number of 
Irish·Americans in the last ten 
years who have become 
knowledgeable on the 
situation has grown incred· 
ibly. I teach a couple of Irish 
history courses back in New 
York, and the enrollments in 
these courses has been 
growin~. I don't know if the 
" Roots' phenomenon (the 
Alex Haley book and 
subsequent TV drama) is 
responsible for this, but 
thousands of Irish·Americans 
who know they are Irish but 
don't know anything about 
Ireland are starting to educate 
themselves abou t Irish 
history. They are learning 
such things, for example: that 
the Continental Army that 
George Washinglon led was 53 
percen t Iri sh. George 
Washington became an 
honorary member of the 
"Friendly Sons of St . Patrick." 
A recent study by the William 
& Mary Quarterly indicated 
that the Irish and Scottish 
populations of the colonies 
was a major reason for the 
resort to warfare by Lord 
North's government. There is 
a growing cultural awareness 
amongst Irish·Americans and 
Scottish·Americans that, 
"Hey, we played a very 
significant role in breaking 
away from England, and you 
know something, it is not 
terribly unlike the problem 
that is going on in Northern 

Ireland today. What they are 
trying to do is break away from 
England." 
Guardian: What about the 
European Commission on 
Human Rights? Didn't they 
ask a week ago today for an 
investigation of the goings·on 
in Ireland? 
Walsh: That's right. The 
European Commission on 
Human Rights serves at the 
pleasure of the European 
Parliment which presides in 
Stasburg, France. There is a 
European Charter on Human 
Rights which all the 
subscribing members of the 
parliament sign. The British 
signed it, and they were found 
guilty of violating article 73, 
which deals with the 
incarceration of prisoners. 
The English contested it, there 
was a litigation before the 
Commission and the Attorney 
General of England was 
debating with the Attorney 
General of Ireland . The 
Commission ruled in favor of 
Ireland, finding that England 
was guil ty of mistreating 
those suspected IRA terrorists 
in their prison s through 
systematic use of degrading 
torture techniques. Some of 
the techniques were appalling. 
One of them is - by the way, 
many of these techniques were 
taught to them by the United 
States government, which we 
apparently learned from our 
experience in Vietnam . 
Anyway, one of the tortures is 
to take a prisoner into a 
helicopter and put a blindfold 
over the prisoner and then 
take off. The helicopter 
returns to ground (still about 
two feet in the air) and you tell 
the prisoner that if he doesn't 
talk, you are going to throw 
him out of the aircraft. What 
you do is throw him out - he's 
only two feet off the ground 
but he doesn't know that, and 
it creates an incredible 
traumatic neurotic effect 
which results in either a 
mental schizophrenic break· 
down or a confession. 
Amnesty International, which 
is an English organization of 
lawyers, issued a report in 
1981 where they found that 98 
percent of the convictions in 
Northern Ireland prisons were

the result of confessions. In 
the United States by 
comparison, confessions 
account for fewer than 5 
percent of our convictions, 
confessions under Miranda 
and other requirements, are 
extremely rare. 98 percent of 
the Irishmen who are sent to 
jail in Northern Ireland do so 
as the result of confessions. 80 
percent of those 98 percent are 
convicted only on the basis of a 
confession, only, no corrobor· 
ating testimony, and no 
collateral evidence to indicate 
that they have committed a 
crime. Solely convicted on the 
grounds of a confession, many 
of the confessions are 
extracted under the circum· 
stances that I told you, taking 
arrson and throwing him out 
o a helicopter. Other 

techni~ues the British use are 
called 'white noise," sensory 
deprivation, "hooding," a 
technique known as hooding. 
You put a hood over a person, 
throw them in what is the 
equivalent of a padded cell, and 
leave them without any sound 
or contact with human beings 
for periods from 48 to 150 
hours. During this period of 
time, the human psyche 
cracks, and people will do or 
say anything. Now these 
statistics and these instances 
that I am relating to you were 
not dreamed up by me. These 
have been verified by Amnesty 
International and by the 
European Commission of 
Human Rights. I think it is 
long overdue for the American 
press and the American 
government to start question· 
ing what's doing on in Ireland. 
N ow the British response to all 
this is "Don't butt in in our 
affairs; these people are 
terrorists." They love to 
compare the Irish Republican 
Army to thp Puerto Rican 
LibernatlOnal Army which 

blows up places like the police 
headq uarters of N ew York city 
not too long ago. They couldn't 
be further from the truth 
when they make that 
comparison. The IRA are 
fighting in Ireland to keep the 
British out of Ireland. The 
Puerto Ricans are in N ew York 
conducting business whatever 
their business may be. The 
simple problem is that the 
British are in Ireland, and the 
IRA is taking the position that 
they don't belong there. And 
I'm taking the position that 
they don't belong there, and I 
think the overhwelming 
majority of Irish·Americans 
believe that they don't belong 
there. The question is "how do 
we get them out?" Now I would 
like the Queen to answer that 
question. 

Guardian: How would you 
answer it? 
Walsh: What they should do 
is set a date for withdrawing. 
They then abide by it, and 
make clear to the Protestant 
community in Northern 
Ireland that their bigotry and 
their discrimination against 
Catholics are no longer going 
to be tolerated, and that the 
British exchequer is not going 
to support a fascist commun· 
ity. When that date for 
withdrawal comes, you are on 
your own, fellas , so come to an 
agreement. There is no reason 
that they cannot do that. 
Guardian: Obviously this 
solution has been suggested 
before; what has been the 
reason for the English 
negative reply? 
Walsh: The British response 
is "If we pull out, there will be 
a bloodbath." I ask you, hasn't 
there been 2000 deaths so far, 
isn't it a bloodbath for the last 
ten years? How much worse 
can it get? The solution is 
simple, the English have 

Mayoral candidates to debate 
The four major candidates 

for mayor of San Diego - City 
Councilman Bill Mitchell, 
Deputy Mayor Bill Cleator, 
County Supervisor Roger 
Hedgecock, and Port Commis· 
sioner Maureen O'Connor -
will participate Sunday in a 
deb ate i n Man d e v i II e' 
Auditorium. 

Sponsored by the Urban and 
Rural Studies Program, the 
debate begins at 7:30 pm and is 
free and open to the public. 

Each candidate will make 
two·minute opening state-
ments, repond to questions 
from a panel of San Diego 
County journalists and then 
be given two minutes for 
closing remarks. 

Most local polls give 
O'Connor the edge in the race, 
but no one candidate is 
expected to win a majority in 
the March 15 election. A runoff 
is set for May 3. Call 452·3690

gotten out of every colony they 
were once in . They have gotten 
out of Kenya, India, Rhodesia, 
Malta, Syria. Gana, and the 
United States. Why haven't 
they gotten out of Ireland? 
Guardian: Do you see Irish· 
Americans becoming as 
influential to American 
foreign pol icy as other 
minority groups? 
Walsh: Basically, I think the 
day is coming when the Irish· 
American community will be 
as vocal and as contributory to 
American policy as, say, 
J ewish·Americans and Black 
Americans. When that day 
comes, no one can say that 
Irish·Americans are different 
from any other American 
group , instead, Irish · 
Americans are merely asking 
for justice for ourconcems the 
way our fellow Americans ask 
for theirs. 
Guardian: The killings, the 
same situation has been going 
on for so long. The British are 
st ill occupying Ireland, 2000 
people have been murdered. 
Do you ever expect a 
resolution between the two 
countries? 
Walsh: I certainly do. Can I 
point out that, until 1921, the 
26 counties of Ireland have 
been under British rule for 791 
years. I tell my students that if 
it took 791 to get 20, maybe we 
can wait 100 more to get the 
other six. I think the point 
really isn't whether or not 
chronology is in our favor, 
justice is on our side. The issue 
here is a very simple one. Let 
the English government tell 
the civilized world why they 
are in Ireland. Let them 
explain to the United Nations 
why it is they have created a 
treaty which says "Protes· 
tants have citizens rights in 
part of the United Kingdom 
and Catholics don't. Why is it 
that Protestants and Catholics 
have to be separated on 
religion only in Northern 
Ireland?" It doesn't exist (the 
separation of religion) in 
Scotland, doesn't exist in 
Wales, it doesn't exist in 
England, and doesn 't exist in 
the Republic of Ireland. Why 
are the English subsidiz ing a 
government that is based upon 
religiou s su premacy for 
Presbyterians? I think if they 
were forced in an open forum 
to confront these issues, It 
would be they, not I, who 
would be answering a 
reporter's questions.

Skiers barely miss Nationals Athlete 

of the

By BRAD SCURLOCK 
Staff Writer 

Two points out of a total of 
600 was the difference 
between victorr and defeal. 
The UCSD men s ski team lost 
at June Mountain. and UC 
Santa Barbara will represent 
the Southern California 
Intercollegiate Skiing 
Association in the National 
Intercollegiate Skiing 
Association at Waterville 
Mountain. New Hampshire 
this weekend . This is 
undertandably a great 
disappointment to UCSD, a 
young team that has gathered 
tremendous respect through-
out Southern California by 
leading the SCISA going into 
the February 19th national 
qua lifying event at June 

Playoffs 
tonight 

By MIKE GREENBERG 
Staff Writers 

H's time for the second 
season. Throwaway the 
season records and statistics. 
Tonight at 8 pm in Azusa 
Pacific, the UCSD men's 
basketball team will compete 
in the first fund of the NAIA 
District III playoffs. John 
Block's team is seeded fifth in 
the eight team tourney (the top 
four teams received the home 
court advantage in the first 
round), and will be attempting 
to rebound from a disap-
pointing 59-55 season-ending 
loss to Point Lorna last Friday 
in the Pavi lion . 

The Tritons had hoped to 
host the first round of the 
playoffs, but after the loss to 
the Crusaders, the league 
committee which met last 
Sunday decided that Azusa 
deserved the advantage by 
virtu re of the team's better 
league record, 8-6 to UCSD's 7-
5. But Block is stil very 
confident about his team's 
c han ces. " I'm confident 
because r know we are the 
better team," said Block, 
"Azusa will be tough in their 
tiny gym, but If we execute the 
way we are capable of, we 
should be able to Win." The 
second round of the playoffs 
will be held Saturday night at 
a neutral site, Chapman 
College. Should they win, the 
Tritons' likely opponent will 
be the victor of the Westmount 

Cal Lutheran contest. 
Transportation may be 
available at the Intercollegiate 
Office for tonight's game.

LISA GILBERT 
Women's Tennis 

Despite losing the national 
bid, UCSD put on spectacular 
performances in both the 
s lalom and giant slalom races. 
Led by Mike Hann's sixth 
place finish in the s lalom and 
Chris Littlewood's third place 
in the giant slalom, the men's 
team amazingly placed four 
skiers in the top 20 of each 
event. Currently the men's 
team holds second place in the 
CISA, behind Santa Barbara, 
while the women 's team is 
ranked number three, behind 
unbeaten UCLA and Orange 
Coast Jr. College. In combined 
overall team scoring, UCSD 
ranks second behind UCLA 
with three race weekends 
remaining in the regular 
season com peti tion. After 
narrowly missing the national 
bid, revenge-seeking UCSD is 
determined to capture the 
SCISA Championship title 
and the accompanying six foot 

1983 is the finest season in 
UCSD skii ng hi story and 
Coach Art Sloat looks to the 
future with contInued 
optimism. Later this season, 
five ski team members will be 
competing in downhill races, a 
first for UCSD. The three year 
old team is currently in the 
process of obtaining recog-
nition as an official 
intercollegiate team . This 
recognition would allow the 
presently self-supporting club 
to compete with the Eastern 
powerhouses and recruit 
experienced skiers from 
around the nation. 

The future of the UCSD 
team depends on participation . 
While the team is losing only 
three racers thIS season, 
Coach Sloat encourages 
anyone interested in trying out 
for the 1984 team to contact 
either Coach Nick Nedd or 
himself at the Intercollegiate 
Office as soon as poSSIble. 

The number two seed on the number one team has lost 
but one match all season (to a Div. I player) while racking 
up eight singles wins, losing only one set in the process. Her 

~igges~ win of the season came in the match against USIU, 
10 whIch she embarrassed her Div. I opponent &0, 6-0. 
Against Pomona Pitzer the scores were &2, 6·0; against Pt . 
Loma, 6·0, 6-1. Her only dropped set came against Biola 
before she rebounded to win 4-6, 6-3, 6-2. Lisa has also 
teamed WIth Dena Neal to go undefea ted in the numbertwo 
doubles spot. Coach Liz Dudash characterizes her playas 
"extremely steady from the baseline," adding that she has 
pla yed "exceptionally well. She's alway~ one of the first off 
the court5." After being hospitalized for an infectIOn last 
year, LIsa IS coming back strong in her sophomore sea~on 
on the squad. 

Rough, sporadic start greets softball club 
By JOE FALLETTA 

Staff Writer 
That all important combina-

tion of good defense and good 
offense eluded UCSD softball 
agian last week as the Tritons 
dropped a double header to 
Chapman College, 17-1 and 8-

0, and a single game to 
Palomar College, 7-0. It was 
the Tritons' fifth loss in as 
many games so far this year. A 
game against Southwestern 
College was postponed 
because of rain as was this 
week's home double header 

agatnst Loyola Marymount 
At home against Palomar 

College, good pitching and 
good fielding stopped the 
Comets for three innings until 
a walk, a wild pitch , two 
errors, and two solid hits 
brought five runs across. Two 

Hoop playoffs at a glance 
Tonight's game: UCSD (13-12, 7-6 league) against Azusa Pacific (14-15, 8·5) at the 
Cougar gym. 
Azusa's strengths: Azusa's overaIl record is unimpressive, but they have been playmg 
their best ball onate. The Couprs employ a tough man-to-man and wne press that can give 
their opponent fits when apphed correctly. A 23-point victory over third seeded Southern 
Cal CoIlege was a perfect example ofthis. The Cougars possess oneofthe quickest guards in 
the league, Michel Lloyd, a transfer from Nevada Las Vegas. Despite lacking height, (Ron 
Letourneau is the tallest Cougar at &6), Azusa has been able to outrebound opponents by a 
significant margin. 
Azusa'a weaknesses: The loss of scoring leader Jeff Robinson (broken leg) hasn't hurt 
the Cougars as much as having junior point guard sidelined Jeff Apana(spratned knee) . 
Michael Lloyd, however, has more than compensated for Apana's departure, and the team 
seems to play better without Robinson than with him. But Azusa does lack a dominatmg 
scorer they can go to in the final minutes of a game when they need a basket. 
UCSD strength8: Point guard Bobby Goodman and forward Ron Hicks have been steady 
all season long for the Tritons, averaging 30 points between them. Ray Banales can be 
deadly when he is on the mark, but unfortunately that hasn't been too often. Reserve Ste\e 
Flint. anc\ Brand~n Nixon have been playing very well of late and will likely see a lot of 
playmg ttme tOnight. When the rebounding game is clickin.ll no one runs betterthan UCSD. 
UCSD weakne8ses: Poor rebounding has plagued the team all year long, with a certain 
trend developing_ When the Tritons outrebound their opponents, they usually Wtn. When 
they are outrebounded, as was the case the last time they met Azusa, they lose. John Block 
must get production on both ends from his front line (Mike Dabasmskas, Mike Maross , and 
Dave McGuire) if UCSD wants to avoid a blowout. 
Key matchup8: Good"",,, liS. Lloyd, Both players have pro potential , and the one who is 
more effective will probably give his team a decisive edge. Azusa 's Ron utourneau liS. Triton 
coins Dabasi1tSkas attd McG"ire. Last time the two teams met, Letourneau pulled in 14 
boards while the Triton dynamic duo could only muster five. Better board production IS 
critical if UCSD is going to prevail.

Running Thoughts 
By MIKE GREENBERG and JEFF SAVAGE 

Staff Writer. 
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE DEPT. It's playoff time, and 
one has to think that the UCSD men's basketball team could be 
in a much better situation than having to take the long drive up 
to Azusa Pacific to play the Cougars in the opening rou~d of 
NAIA District III action . Head Coach John Block has said all 
season how he wants the team to peak at playoff time. With the 
squad playing so incons!stently it is very hard to figure ~hat this 
team is capable of. Is thiS a team that was the only one In league 
play to defeat Westmont, or are they the bunch of guys w~o lo~t 
two of their last three home games to Southern Cahforma 
College and Point Lorna? Will the real Triton team please stand 
up - or just play quality basketball? We should find out about 
the 1982-83 Tritons tonight because it is time to put all those 
redundant questions to bed. It' s showtime. 
NOT TO BE BELIEVED DEPT. The women's basketball 
team. unlike the men's, has been very consistent. Despitec\osing 
out their season with a loss to Division I USD last Saturday 
night, Judy Malone's squad has exceeded all expectations, 
Finishing 17·9 (12-4 in Div. III), narr<?wly missing the pl~yoffs 
with basically a very young team, things can only get bnghter 
for the women in white and Rold . "We were much improved over 
last season," says Malone_ ' I'm already looking forward to next 
year_" Next season should be grand with the likes of Parker, 
Sweatt, McKeone, Gregory, Krause, Francis. Michelotti and 
company retu~ing for another cam~ai~n. M~lone is taking the 
right course With her program by bUilding With youth . The last 
two recruiting years have been banner ones for the eight year 
coach. 
COULD IT BE DEPT. Major League Baseball has 
apparently decided to follow in the paths of hockey, basketball, 
and most recently, football by designing a playoff format 
whereby the first three t.eams in each. of the. four divisio':ls 
qualify for post season actIOn. ~he plan IS to be !mplemente~ In 
the upcoming 193 season and Will be structured In the follOWing 
manner: the second and third place teams in each division will be 
awarded wild card berths and will square off in a bes~-of-five 
series while the first place team receives a bye . The wild card winn~rs will then meet the four first place teams in a best-of-
seven series. The four finalists will then compete in the 
championship series of their respective leagues in a best-of-nine 
match up. The World Series will now be a~ ll-game series to be 
played sometime in late December. Accordtn~ toone top baseball 
official, "All the owners are quite pleased With the new format 
because of the tremendous amount of revenue generated . It (the 
format) also gives each team a far better shot at post-season 
play."

The Wight Family Players closed out their Coed AA basketball 
season with a forfeit win over the Hot Shots to up their record to 6-l. 
This team has a line up of players that would not only make Jerry Buss 
sit up and take notice but open his checkbook too, Tom Wight, 
former UCSD varsity b-ball star, Bob Patterson and assistant varsity 
coach Tom Marshall make up the weaker half of the "family." The real 
strength comes from the outstanding play of women like Jill Keene, 
former varsity player, Vanessa Davis, Ann Bearis, Leighann layton, 
linda Fogarty, and the quick moves of Debbie Fox. So, Jerry, if you're 
tired of the Lakers' slump just get on the phones to the Wight Family 
Players and sit back and pour yourself a cold Miller beer.

It was predsely 2:45 pm last Sundflol 
when the reins came and weshed out 
the "nal two events of the 8th ennual 
UCSD Supc:rst.s compdltion. Oru 
Ven Hengl had just d eared 4'61n the 
high jump with most of the remaining 
compdltOl'S poised, shivering. yet 
reedy In the wings waiting patiently 
for their IIrst attempts at the ber. 

Compdltion will be resumed this 
Sunday at 2 pm on the Warren Track. 

newcomer Steve Losil have outside 
chances of passing him up this 
Sundflol· 

It was rally e shame. The last two 
events, the high Jump and the mile, 
promised to put the "nlshlng touches 
on e stirring competition. 

For the nrst 3'" dflolS, eight tams 
and some thirty Individual 
compdltOl'S bettled It out mano-a-
mano for Superstars points. And 
when the heavens opened, It was 
pretty much an Instant replflol of 
previous competitions. 

UCSD's own version of Bruce 
Jenner, Rick Wilbert, was well on his 

w~ to another title and perhaps 
another record performance. 

On teemmate Eddie Novek and 

Wilbert, however, has a tall order In 
front of him If he wishes to reclaim 
Craig Kreeger's Superstars point 
record of 6064 for 8 events. 

Fa[ him to crack the magic berrier, 
Wilbert needs to Jump around 5'6' In 
the high Jump and run a mile In 5 
minutes lIat. His bests are 5'5' and 
5:07. Knowing Wilbert as we have the 
past three years, we WOUldn't put It 
past him.

Take Charge At 11. 

In most jobs, at 22 
you're near the bottom 
of the ladder. 

In the Navy, at 
22 you can be a leader. 
After just 16 weeks 
of leadership training, 
you're an officer. You'll 
have the kind of job 

care of sophisticated 
equipment worth 
millions of dollars. 

It's a bigger chal-
lenge and a lot more 
responsibility than 
most corporations give 
you at 22. The rewards 
are bigger, too. There's 

your education and training prepared 
you for, and the decision-making au-
thority you need to make the most of it. 

As a college graduate and officer 
candidate, your Navy training is geared 
to making you a leader. There is no boot 
camp. Instead, you receive professional 
training to help you build the technical 
and management skills you'll need as a 

a comprehensive package of benefits, 
including special duty pay. The starting 
salary is $17,000-more than most com-
panies would pay you right out of college. 
After four years, with regular promo-
tions and pay increases, your salary will 
have increased to as much as $31,000. 

Navy officer. 
This training is 

designed to instill 
confidence by first-
hand experience. You 
learn by doing. On 
your first sea tour, 
you're responsible for 
managing the work of 
up to 30 men and the 

As a Navy officer, you grow, through 
new challenges, new tests of your skills,

Tuesday With t he UC

ending with a home game 
against the University of 
Redlands on April 5, hope 
springs eternal for Wight and 
crew. The season is young 
and, with conference games 
not due until the second half of 
the season, Wight says UCSD 
is sti11 looking for a lineup that 
works. 

Friday's game agianst 
Palomar saw UCSD's fir, t 
baseman Jan Martin behind 
the plate and doing well, 
catcher Vanessa Davis on the 
mound striking out three, and I Cathy Williamson, who has 
played short and second base, 
showing good talent at first. 

Wight says the Tritons' 
main pitcher, Julie Drause, 
will not take up mound duties 
until after basketball season. 
Meanwhile , competition 
against the Tritons has been 
steep and even junior colleges 
like Palomar and South-
western come highly respec-
ted. 

"It's still early in the 
season," she says.

The building 
as an artistic 
showplace 

ByKOMHV 
The cunent exhibit at the Mandeville Art 

Gallery does not purport to be a show with 
something for everyone. However, At /lome 
with Architecture: Contempofa'1l Views of 
the /louse does offer an overview of 
postmodem architecture applied to single 
family dwellings, and should .>e rewarding to 
those willing to put a little thought Into the 
viewing experience. 

A visitor to the gallery can take In the 
exhibition on several levels. One can simply 
admire what Is Inside the gallery: a 
collection of beautifully detailed models, 
photographs, meticulously drawn plans and 
collages. On this level, the viewer would be 
Impressed by the painstaking attention to 
detail that goes Into each stage of planning 
the house, from sketch to ftnlshed product 

The visitor taking In the exhibit on this 
most basic level would undoubtedly marvel 
at the cleverness of the scale reproductions, 
the exacting quality of the pen and Ink 
renderings, the beauty of colored pencil 
drawings. He or she would also be missing 
half the show. 

The real beauty of At /lome With 
Architecture, lies not In what Is actually 
within the gallery walls, but In what went 
Into these models and drawings. These are 
the work of some of the most distinguished 
of architect/artists: Arqultectonica, Batey ~ 
Mack, Peter eisenman, frank Gehry, Michael 
Graves , Moore/Ruble/Yudell, Rob 
Wellington Quigley, Susana Torre, Tod 
Williams and Associates, and VenturI, Rauch 
and Scott-8rown. The ultimate expression of 
form and function, the houses are art that 
one can live with, and live In as well . One Is 
constantly reminded that these houses are 
homes, tailored for speclftc clients and 
speclftc sites: they must be practical as well 
as aesthetically pleasing. 

The homes represented range from lavish 
to modest, from a building cost of around 

~70,OOO to well over $I million. A private 
residence designed by Michael Graves Is a 
good example of lavishness: what one might 
build If one has a view of Manhattan, a 
collection of foreign automobiles, a ftalr for 
the dramatic, and a large expense account 

To appreciate the absolute grandeur of 
this home requires at least a lengthy 
Inspection of the glass-enclosed model and 
accompanying drawings (or better stili, a 
view of the actual house), but sumce to say 
that the problem of accomodatlng the car 
collection Is solved neatly by a wing of 
garages on one side of the entrance 
forecourt, and a freestanding garage 
pavilion. There Is a " typical french 
courtyard" modi fled to Include a large 
swimming pool and a garden .. . well, the 
archltects·s display speaks for Itself. 

The Holt Residence, designed by Batey ~ 
Mack, seems to be a modern adaptation of a 
Roman villa, sitting on the edge of an

expanse of the flat bay, with an addditional 
pool of water to reflect the sky. Italian 
travertine, MexJcan sandstone and Texas 
granite combine to create ancient Roman 
splendor In Corpus Christi, Texas, 1982 : "The 
plan Is organized around Interior courts -
an atrium and Impluvlum based on Roman 
prototypes. .. The house Is furnished with 
classical antiques and some of the walls -
here and there partially crumbling away -
are washed with faded Pompeltan colors." 

Venturi, Rauch and Scott-8rown show 
almost exclusively smaller houses, yet these 
have as much planning and Imagination 
Involved as any of the larger homes. The 
Houae In Northeastern Delaware Is an 
unpretentious home for a family of three, 
with flat and stylized columns 
(" representations of the Doric order," 
explain the architects). 

The House on LonA Island Sound, by 

"AxOllOlBetrfc Plodel House X" by [Weaman 

Steven lzenour with Venturi, Rauch, and 
Scott-8rown, distinguished by a large ship 
sheel "rose" window. The simple square 
bungalow takes advantage of waterfronts to 
the east and the south, four flat Doric 
columns, as In the Delaware house, frame the 
Long Island Sound. 

frank O. Gehry Is the architect for the 
Whitney Residence In Los Angeles, a house 
"comprised of separate and disconnected 
volumes, each with a distinct character." In 
other words, the rooms of the house are 
scattered about the property like boxes, " the 
client camping from box to box and In the 
Intervening spaces." This unusual house 
Includes a greenhouse, a guest house with 
outdoor movie screen, a long narrow 
swimming pool, and a three-car garage. The 
halls of the house are completely 
dlscoMected from the rooms and are placed 
In the yard, and the guest bathroom Js In a 
tower away from the guest rooms. 

Peter [Isenman's " House X" Is a marked 
departure from the traditional, and also from 
the post-modem notions of architecture. 
While most houses, [Isenman claims, are 
"conceptually vertebrate," having a central 
hearth or stairway to center around, House X 
Is non-vertebrate, divided Into four 
quadrants. [ven these quadrants are non-
vertebrate: to move from kitchen to dining 

room one must move to a different unit, 
while a bedroom and a living room share a 
unit. A particularly striking part of 
t lsenman's display Is the axonometrtc 
model of the house, a model which appears 
"normal" only when vlewer1 from a spedflc 
angle. 

"Plaba House" In Texas by Arqultectonka 

Most of the houses on display are not 
attempts to redeftne architecture, as House X 
seems to be, but are attempts to refine 
exiting deflnltlons and add new meanings to 
them .. Susana Torre literally builds the new 
Into the framework of the old: Clam House, 
for example, Is a former stable, totally 
transformed on the Inside and moved to a 
new location, but only slightly modlned on 
the outside In order to preserve Its former 
Identity. 

Susana Torre Is also the designer for the 
two-silo Bach House, built, as she states 
"primarily out of prefabricated elements: 
two wooden sllos ... skyllght, Iron spiral 
staircase, and wood decking." An Innovative 
"bridge" of mirrored glass connects tl\e 
silos, reflecting the trees and thus creating 
the tJIuslon that the silos are not connected 
at all. 

My personal favorite, In terms of pure 

fantasy, Is the Maba House In Houston 
designed by Arqultectonlca. this home 
reacts to the bleak surroundings by 
providing Its own built-In scenery. The house 
Is divided Into flve architecturally distinct 
parts facing five distinct courtyards walled 
In different materials: white brick, pink 
marble, glass, etc. 

The most Imaginative feature of this flve-
courtyard scheme Is the method used to

Ever since Stanard Ridgway 
appeared. face twitching and all. 
with Marc and Bruce Moreland 
as the first version of Wall of 
Voodoo in 1978 there has been a 
great deal of attention placed 
upon the rise of an L.1t band 
that has the notoriety of once 
being an organization dedicated 
towards the sale of giant 
telescopes and "amazing sea 
monkeys" for Its existence. 

Wall of Voodoo comes to town

Wall of Voodoo. All the boys 
cooped up in a dressing room 
and I tum and say, "Cmon BIll. 
let's get out of here and go run

marketable than your previous 
material?

synthesizers and bass, Joe 
Nanini as percussionist. Marc 
Moreland on six and twelve 
string guitars and 8i11 Moreland 
on synthesizers. 

As a performing entity. Wall 
of Voodoo is a very competent 
synthesizer-oriented band. 
Instead of the usual array of 
instruments that are used only 
once during a performance. Wall 
of Voodoo actually plays their 
instruments instead of relying 
on elaborate presets in order to 
cover up lack of musical skill. 

On stage. Wall of Voodoo has 
a very plain set-up. drums. 
Moreland stage right and front 
and Ridgway on center stage. 
Once in front of the audience. 
Wall of Voodoo proceeds to play 
near exact reproductions of the 
music on their albums. 

What this amounts to is a 
happy medium between the 
gonzo bands that turn each song 
into a twenty-minute 
extravaganza and the bands that 
have such incompetence that 
they only can sound good after 
the two thousandth take in a 
recording studio. 

Ridgway: We 've never tried to 
play any kind of music that 
befuddles anybody's under-
standing about us, It just 
happens to tum out that way 
sometimes. I'm glad that people 
see It to be that non-elitist form 
ofmuslc we're building because 
we've never tried to make music 
that's particularly alienating to 
any faction or clique. We don't 
really believe in the club aspect 
too much. What's best I think is 
to try and realize what you e!1ioy 
and magnify those elements as 
much as you see fit. It·s funny, 
you're in an entertainment 
industry and an entertainment 

By JOHN riff 
had a phon2 and we even got a 
rotary on the telephone in case 
we got a lot of calls so we could 
put people on hold, Those were 
some lonely months there, What 
essentially happened was that 
we began soliciting Hollywood 
producers with music that they 
didn't need. We ended up doing 
a few porno films and a 
Canadian tourist film that was 
cancelled after two weeks. but 
we were still paid for it. It just 
kind of turned into a band. We 
made a conscious decision at 
one point. "Why don·t we take 
these and I'll slap some words 
on them" and it kind of grew 

not having made a fil m of It. I 
think most people th ink very 
programatlcally about music, 
There 's very few people unless 
you 're a real dry head or 
something that you don 't see 
some image when you listen to 
music. 

That was really big back in 
the 1800's when the romantic 
period was at an all time high. 
People like Berlioz. you couldn't 
really listen to any music by 
Berlioz without a program. 
You 'd know that movement one 
was the witch in the doorway of 
the hut selling eggs to the 
children. If you didn 't know that 

Ridgway: Yes, I do. But I th ink 
Its mainly us getting better at 
what we do. We didn't sit down 
thinking that that would be the 
single, It Just kind of worked 
Itself out that way. We've always 
looked at our music as our 
approach to pop music. What we 
write Is really popular music to 
us. It's all different for different 
people. We've even had trouble 
with "Mexican Radio," We've 
had peop le asking us If 
" Mex ican Radio" was 
derogatory towards MexJcans. I 
think to myself. "What possibly 
In the song could lead you to 
believe that? Could It possibly 
be the word MexJcan?" 

It's kind of a funny thing. 
We've always ertloyed sitting In 
our cars and trying to find the 
Mexican radio stations that drift 
In and out on the dial, We 
thought It was great to be 
listening to something that we 
didn't understand. Its kind of 
soothing to me. I don't know 
why, It's about a guy that's 
listening In his car and he's 
transported down to Mexico 
where he has his own live show. 
To me It's a tale about vanishing 
urban comm un Icatlon and 
ethnic bewilderment. 

Wall of Voodoo will be 
playing this coming Sunday at 
the Del Mar fairgrounds with 
the English Beat. Recently 
Ridgway talked with Hiatus 
about the band, 
ffia lus: You recently referred to 
Wall of Voodoo 's music as 
something for "the vast urban 
barbeque," What exactly did you 
mean by that? 

The sometimes wUd and aau4 WaD of Voodoo wUl play Sunday at tile Del Jltar r alrgrounds. 

ffliltus: Are you pleased with 
where the band Is now? 
Ridgway: The way the band j 
playing and the way we're 
performing the music that we're 
writing. yeah I can say I'm 
happy. I really don't like the 
business. Rock and Roll Is a real 
stinking, horrible thing, Not It, 
the attitude. but the business. 
You find a lot of Incompetent 
people. a lot of hangers on. 
suckers and things like that. I 
don't care for Its attitude 
predominately towards women, 
To me. the stereotype of pln'up 
rock I Hnd to be very obscene. 
/flatus: What prompted you to 
cover Johnny Ca5h's 'Ring of 
fire"? 

Ridgway: Yeah I probably said 
that at one time or another You 
sec. the thing is I used that 
phrase " the vast urban 
ba rbec ue" to descri be 
something I couldn't verbalize. I 
don't rea ll y know. I guess what 
it means is tha t most ofthe t ime 
I'm just as confused as anybody 
else as to what to call what we 
do. It would be very simple for 
me to say that it was just "new 
music" or something but I think 
that goes without saying - it 
was a flippant remark. 
nialus: Many publications see 
Wall of Voodoo 's music asbeing 
a new kind of all-american-
country-western -type genre . 
What do you see about the 
motives of the band? 

medium but at the same time 
you're in an artistic medium as 
well as a business . It's 
confusing, you know. I really do 
spend mo~t of my life totally 
confused. 
Hiatus: Wall of Voodoo started 
out as a business ... 
Ridgway: It was a soundtrack 
company. Our aspirations were 
to wr ite soundtracks for high 
goth ic. you know. kind of touch 
of evil and things like that. Thf' 
only people that we could fi nd 
doing that were some of the 
students that were at USC or 
UCLA. we did some shorts which 
usually ended up being shown in 
somebody's bedroom. none of 
this was theatrical release 
material. Then we got confident 
about that and said, "Why don ·t 
we turn this into a real thing?" 

So we got an office and we

Ilia Ius: Do any of your 
published ~l1gs arise from your

Ridgway: One in particularthat 
I like to describe is "The

L.P That was a song that we had 
put together for Airport 1980. 
We though that.theywould need 
some kind of credit music and 
we wrote it with that in mind. No 
one really wanted it. With that 
visua l kind of cinematic image 
in mind I wrote the words that 
are on there now. It worked out 
that way with quite a number of 
songs. 
nlatus: Do you still maintain 
that cinematic image in your 
writing today?

everyone in the band does. A lot

approach to that though Is that

rUD and games at the 25th 
Annual Grammy Awards 

By MDRfW Kt:f:ILR 
Colin Hay, of the Australian 

band Men at Work, stood on a 
small, black podium wearing a 
plaid vest and faced two dozen 
Inquiring jounaUsts. His band 
hadjust won the Grammyaward 
for best new artist. One loud 
woman pressed, "Did you think 
you would win?" Hay seemed 
amused. " We didn't think too 
much about it. but. you know it 
would have been a long way to 
come to lose," 

And so it went at last week 's 
25th Annual Grammy Awards 
ceremony at the Shrine 
Auditorium in iDs Angeles. 
Sponsored by the National 
Academy of Recording Arts & 
Sciences (NARAS), this gala is 
held every year to honor the 
best in the business, 

This year's ceremony could 
best be described as a "TOTO 
Conquest." The middle-of-the-
road pop group picked up 
awards in almost every 
category, including Record of 
the Year ("Rosanna") and 
Album of the Year (TOTO IV). By 
the end of the three hour 
program, members ofthe media 
backstage were praying, "please 
no more TOTO, we have no 
questions left." 

As with all big awards 
extravaganzas, the star-gazers 
were out in full force. Music fans 
lined up early in the daywaiting 
to get a glimpse oftheir favorite 
stars. A team of security guards 
kept the crowd back as limo 
after limo carted t~e performers 
up to the entrance. 

It was not much better 
backstage in the press area. In 
the television area. cameramen 
and reporters jockeyed for 
position in the cramped 
quarters. The photo area, which 
was nicknamed "The Zoo," 
featured as much action as the 
actual ceremony. Photogra-
phers stood on tables and 
climbed on anything that wasn't 
breathing to get the desired 
shot:While Men at Work were in 
fr 0 n t 0 f the au die n c e 
performing "Down Under," a 
shoving match broke out in the 
photo area between two 

overzealous cameramen, 
Staffers of NARAS would 

parade the performers, 
presenters and winners through 
the media area at a rapid fire 
pace to pose for photos and field 
questions. This made it hard on 
the press who had to keep one 
eye on the 1V monitor to see 
what was happening on stage as 
well as Interview the 
entertainers in front of them. 

Reactions of the winners were 
similar, "It Is almost as good as 
sex," quipped Steve Lukather of 
TOTO. Melissa Manchester, who 
won Best female Pop Vocal 
Performance, claimed, "It was 
worth a new pair of pantyhose to 
be here." 

Some of the celebrities had 

more serious matters on their 
mind. After presenting the 
award for Best R&'B Vocal 
Performance, Rick James and 
Grace Jones took time out 
backstage to blast Music 
Television (MlV) for refusing to 
play black-orienled artists. 

Jones raised eyebrows in 
another way. She wore an 
outrageous black and red outfit 
with no back and a minimal 
front and sported a huge 
umbrella-like hat. She was 
greeted by screams and whistles 
in the photo area. 

The most popular visitor 
backstage was comedian Eddie 
Murphy. Although he won no 
awards, Murphy was deluged 
with questions on his rising 
career. Murphy provided the

funniest bit of the evening when 
he walked out on stage while 
lionel Richie was accepting his 
award for Best Pop Vocal 
Performance and stole the 
Grammy from him. Jokingly he 
said, "I wasn't going to leave 
without one of these." 

BiIIlvey, president of NARAS, 
told the press what he thought 
was causing the current record 
industry Slump, " It ·s a 
combination of things. Home 
taping is one and also we don't 
have the overreaChing 
superstars we used to. There is a 
problem with radio play, but 
there is no shortage of good 
music on record." 

Ivey was pleased with the 
overall show that was broadcast

Beatty's "Reds" to 
play here Saturday 

Last year, Warren Beatty 
proved to Hollywood that he 
wasn ·t just another pretty face 
when he won the Academy 
Award for directing Reds.

one founder of the American 
Communist Party John Reed 
(Beatty) and Louise Bryant 
(Diane Keaton ), a couple whose 
love survived their own personal 

contlicts in a period of violent 
and repressive times. 

This is one of the very few 
good epic flIms that Hollywood 
has turned out In the past few 
years. You will all have the 
chance to see it this Saturday in 
Mandeville Auditorium at 8 pm

Music fit for royalty 
by King Sunny Ade 
Juju Music 
King Sunny Ade 
Mango 

By IIIIKIL TOOPIBS 
Uist Sunday was certainly a 

banner day for royalty. Queen 
[lizabeth II of Great 8ritaln paid 
regal visits to Scripps and the 
Old Globe In the afternoon. 
while at night King Sunny Ade 
held court at the Adams Avenue 
Theater. 

Now. Sunny Ade isn ·t really a 
king - only a prince - but 
then. when was the last time you 
heard Queen Uz playa stellar 
lead guitar? 

King Sunny plays a form of 
music known as ·Juju." as you 
might expect from the title of 
his debut American album. Juju 
Music. Juju is the music of the 
Yoruba. Nigeria 's largest tribe. 
and is based on traditional 
talking drums and call -and-
response vocals. 

King Sunny. while certainly 
mindful of his roots - he has to 
be. or he'd be forced to abdicate 
his " throne" - plays a 
decidedly Western style of juju. 
complete with electric guitars 
and s y nth e s lz e r s . J uj u . 

according to Sunny. I:) ramer 
sweet and surprisingly quiet. 
especially when you consider 
that the ¥oruba have been 
called " the loudest people in 
the loudest nation on earth." 

King Sunny. It seems. is first 
and foremost a pop musician -
sort of the African George 
Benson. although much more 
interesting. His music has a 
captivating flowing grace. 
jolted every now and then by 
Jamaican-style dub effects and. 
most effectively. by some 
Hawaiian guitar. 

An early type of steel guitar. 
the Hawaiian guitar was first 
introduced to American blues 
over a half-century ago by 
pioneer Jimmie Rodgers. so its 
use in original African music 
isn·t all that startling. As played 
by Demola Adepoju. though . the 
instrument domina tes the 
sound of King Sunny's 14-
musician African Beats. lending 
a qua li ty to be found in neither 
contemporary Western nor 
tradit ional African music. 

Juju Music is ultimately a 
fi ne work of danceable and 
listenable pop. made 
memorable by King Sunny Ade's 
cross -cultural musical 
assimilation.

The Beat make a 
biumphant return 

Uist December. the Cultural 
Arts Board of SOSU brought lbe 
Beat to San ~iego. for all those 
concerned, the show was an 
overwhelming success, At the 
time. The [ngllsh Beat (as they 
are called In the States) hadjust 
released a new album that 
Jumped to number t1fty~ne on 
the Billboard charts In a matter 
of six weeks, Due to the rapid 
success of this album. Special 
Beat Seroice. the show sold out 
its nine hundred person 
capacity In Just two days. 
leaving many hefty Beat fans 
outside waiting for a friendly 
scalper to satisfy their desire to 
be Involved with a Beat show. 

A live performance by The 
Beat. however. exceeds the 

'

quality of the music that they 
purvey on their albums. With a 

large crowd of hysterical 
teenagers driving them forward. 
they tum around and put even 
more energy Into the audience. 
To date. the Beat has played 
twice In San Diego. This 
upcoming third show will be 
their largest yet. If viewed 
within a proper perspective. the 
Beat is a reasonably eqjoyable 
band but if taken too seriously, 
will result In a terminal case of 
Ska Death . The [ngllsh Beat will 
play this Sunday at the Del Mar 
falrijTOunds. 

Savage Republk will play 
this coming Saturday at the 
Backdoor. 

This rriday. Alan Holds-
wortb will play at the Backdoor 
with IOU. The Gap Band will 
appear Wednesday night at 
Golden Hall. 

Buildings 
as artistic 

• expression 
continued from page] 
Moned them: a swimming pool 

winds through all five 
courtyards expanding here and 
there to accomodate an Island. 
perhaps with a palm tree. 
Arqultectonlca envisions a 
Urestyle where "one walks 
through the house and swims 
through the courtyards. A 
Jaccuul is precariously 
cantilevered over the back alley. 
All In all. the Maba House 
"explores alternatives to the 
conventional suburban home." 

Noted local archItect Rob 
Wellington Quigley shows the 
Sterrett Residence of Rancho 
Santa fe. a house which appears 
substantial and ImpressIve 
despite Its relatively small size. 
Quigley accomplishes thi s 
through a series of Spanish 
c ourtyard s and double 
stairways. 

The Jaeger Beach House. also 
by Quigley. Is actually Isolated 
from the beach by a wall of 
houses. but the pavilion-like 
structures provide a view of the 
ocean nonethelss. and the 
buildings are scattered in such a 
way as to suggest. rather 
whimsically. that a giant wave 
has tossed them up on the 
shore. 

Contrast Qulgley's beach 
house with the New Jersey 
Beach House desglned by 
Michael Graves: while the New 
Jersey house also has a magical 
quallty to it, tastemers have a 
different perception of a beach 
house. and so this one appears 
almost sandcastle-llke. 

The houses represented come 
from near and far. The 
architectural firm of 
Moore/Ruble/Yudell designs 
the Kwee House In Singapore. a 
rather formal residence with 
lush Interior gardens. The same 
firm is responsible for the Rodes 
House In los Angeles. described 
as "serene and formal on a 
modest budget. " 

As the award-winning Charles 
Moore (of Moore/ Ruble/Yudell ) 
once stated: "A house should 
have eyes and ears and arms and 
a heart. and It should talk to you 
when you're In it. It should say 
simple things. naturally - like 
"You're home." "Sit down and 
read here." or "Gather over 
here." But It should also tell a 
cheerful Joke now and then and 
be erudite enough to quote the 
classics." If that Is Indeed the 
function of a house. the single 
family dwellings of At nome 
with Architecture serve theIr 
function remarkably well. 

At nome with AlChitecture:

Nou5e will be showing at the

Skiers barely miss Nationals Athlete 

of the 
Week 

By BRAD SCURLOCK 
Staff Writer 

Two points out of a total of 
600 was the difference 
between victorr and defeal. 
The UCSD men s ski team lost 
at June Mountain. and UC 
Santa Barbara will represent 
the Southern California 
Intercollegiate Skiing 
Association in the National 
Intercollegiate Skiing 
Association at Waterville 
Mountain. New Hampshire 
this weekend . This is 
undertandably a great 
disappointment to UCSD, a 
young team that has gathered 
tremendous respect through-
out Southern California by 
leading the SCISA going into 
the February 19th national 
qua lifying event at June 

Playoffs 
tonight 

By MIKE GREENBERG 
Staff Writers 

H's time for the second 
season. Throwaway the 
season records and statistics. 
Tonight at 8 pm in Azusa 
Pacific, the UCSD men's 
basketball team will compete 
in the first fund of the NAIA 
District III playoffs. John 
Block's team is seeded fifth in 
the eight team tourney (the top 
four teams received the home 
court advantage in the first 
round), and will be attempting 
to rebound from a disap-
pointing 59-55 season-ending 
loss to Point Lorna last Friday 
in the Pavi lion . 

The Tritons had hoped to 
host the first round of the 
playoffs, but after the loss to 
the Crusaders, the league 
committee which met last 
Sunday decided that Azusa 
deserved the advantage by 
virtu re of the team's better 
league record, 8-6 to UCSD's 7-
5. But Block is stil very 
confident about his team's 
c han ces. " I'm confident 
because r know we are the 
better team," said Block, 
"Azusa will be tough in their 
tiny gym, but If we execute the 
way we are capable of, we 
should be able to Win." The 
second round of the playoffs 
will be held Saturday night at 
a neutral site, Chapman 
College. Should they win, the 
Tritons' likely opponent will 
be the victor of the Westmount 

Cal Lutheran contest. 
Transportation may be 
available at the Intercollegiate 
Office for tonight's game.

LISA GILBERT 
Women's Tennis 

Despite losing the national 
bid, UCSD put on spectacular 
performances in both the 
s lalom and giant slalom races. 
Led by Mike Hann's sixth 
place finish in the s lalom and 
Chris Littlewood's third place 
in the giant slalom, the men's 
team amazingly placed four 
skiers in the top 20 of each 
event. Currently the men's 
team holds second place in the 
CISA, behind Santa Barbara, 
while the women 's team is 
ranked number three, behind 
unbeaten UCLA and Orange 
Coast Jr. College. In combined 
overall team scoring, UCSD 
ranks second behind UCLA 
with three race weekends 
remaining in the regular 
season com peti tion. After 
narrowly missing the national 
bid, revenge-seeking UCSD is 
determined to capture the 
SCISA Championship title 
and the accompanying six foot 

1983 is the finest season in 
UCSD skii ng hi story and 
Coach Art Sloat looks to the 
future with contInued 
optimism. Later this season, 
five ski team members will be 
competing in downhill races, a 
first for UCSD. The three year 
old team is currently in the 
process of obtaining recog-
nition as an official 
intercollegiate team . This 
recognition would allow the 
presently self-supporting club 
to compete with the Eastern 
powerhouses and recruit 
experienced skiers from 
around the nation. 

The future of the UCSD 
team depends on participation . 
While the team is losing only 
three racers thIS season, 
Coach Sloat encourages 
anyone interested in trying out 
for the 1984 team to contact 
either Coach Nick Nedd or 
himself at the Intercollegiate 
Office as soon as poSSIble. 

The number two seed on the number one team has lost 
but one match all season (to a Div. I player) while racking 
up eight singles wins, losing only one set in the process. Her 

~igges~ win of the season came in the match against USIU, 
10 whIch she embarrassed her Div. I opponent &0, 6-0. 
Against Pomona Pitzer the scores were &2, 6·0; against Pt . 
Loma, 6·0, 6-1. Her only dropped set came against Biola 
before she rebounded to win 4-6, 6-3, 6-2. Lisa has also 
teamed WIth Dena Neal to go undefea ted in the numbertwo 
doubles spot. Coach Liz Dudash characterizes her playas 
"extremely steady from the baseline," adding that she has 
pla yed "exceptionally well. She's alway~ one of the first off 
the court5." After being hospitalized for an infectIOn last 
year, LIsa IS coming back strong in her sophomore sea~on 
on the squad. 

Rough, sporadic start greets softball club 
By JOE FALLETTA 

Staff Writer 
That all important combina-

tion of good defense and good 
offense eluded UCSD softball 
agian last week as the Tritons 
dropped a double header to 
Chapman College, 17-1 and 8-

0, and a single game to 
Palomar College, 7-0. It was 
the Tritons' fifth loss in as 
many games so far this year. A 
game against Southwestern 
College was postponed 
because of rain as was this 
week's home double header 

agatnst Loyola Marymount 
At home against Palomar 

College, good pitching and 
good fielding stopped the 
Comets for three innings until 
a walk, a wild pitch , two 
errors, and two solid hits 
brought five runs across. Two 

Hoop playoffs at a glance 
Tonight's game: UCSD (13-12, 7-6 league) against Azusa Pacific (14-15, 8·5) at the 
Cougar gym. 
Azusa's strengths: Azusa's overaIl record is unimpressive, but they have been playmg 
their best ball onate. The Couprs employ a tough man-to-man and wne press that can give 
their opponent fits when apphed correctly. A 23-point victory over third seeded Southern 
Cal CoIlege was a perfect example ofthis. The Cougars possess oneofthe quickest guards in 
the league, Michel Lloyd, a transfer from Nevada Las Vegas. Despite lacking height, (Ron 
Letourneau is the tallest Cougar at &6), Azusa has been able to outrebound opponents by a 
significant margin. 
Azusa'a weaknesses: The loss of scoring leader Jeff Robinson (broken leg) hasn't hurt 
the Cougars as much as having junior point guard sidelined Jeff Apana(spratned knee) . 
Michael Lloyd, however, has more than compensated for Apana's departure, and the team 
seems to play better without Robinson than with him. But Azusa does lack a dominatmg 
scorer they can go to in the final minutes of a game when they need a basket. 
UCSD strength8: Point guard Bobby Goodman and forward Ron Hicks have been steady 
all season long for the Tritons, averaging 30 points between them. Ray Banales can be 
deadly when he is on the mark, but unfortunately that hasn't been too often. Reserve Ste\e 
Flint. anc\ Brand~n Nixon have been playing very well of late and will likely see a lot of 
playmg ttme tOnight. When the rebounding game is clickin.ll no one runs betterthan UCSD. 
UCSD weakne8ses: Poor rebounding has plagued the team all year long, with a certain 
trend developing_ When the Tritons outrebound their opponents, they usually Wtn. When 
they are outrebounded, as was the case the last time they met Azusa, they lose. John Block 
must get production on both ends from his front line (Mike Dabasmskas, Mike Maross , and 
Dave McGuire) if UCSD wants to avoid a blowout. 
Key matchup8: Good"",,, liS. Lloyd, Both players have pro potential , and the one who is 
more effective will probably give his team a decisive edge. Azusa 's Ron utourneau liS. Triton 
coins Dabasi1tSkas attd McG"ire. Last time the two teams met, Letourneau pulled in 14 
boards while the Triton dynamic duo could only muster five. Better board production IS 
critical if UCSD is going to prevail.
