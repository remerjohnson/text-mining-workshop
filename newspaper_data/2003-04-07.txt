evidence suggesting that smoke-free policies 
not only protect people from long·term dan-
gers of second·hand smoke, but they also 
rapidly prevent heart attacks. 

The study's authors attnbute much of the 
sharp decline In acute myocardial infarctions 
to a near-elimination of the effects of sec-
ondhand smoke on blood platelets and the 
artenes that supply blood to the heart 

The researchers also speculate that 
smoke-free enVIronments encourage smok-
ers to stop or reduce smoking. which also 
reduces heart attack risk. 

Dunng an average six-month period, the 
number of hospital admissions for AMI from 
people liVing or working in Helena is just under 
seven per month. However, during the six 
months that the ordinance was in force, the 
number of hospital admission for AMI in 
Helena declined to less than four per month. 
There was no Significant change in the number 
of admissions from outside the Helena area. 

The study'S statistical analysis was pro-
vided by Stanton Glantz, Ph.D., professor of 
medicine at the UCSF Cardiovascular 
Research Institute. The findings were report-
ed at the scientific sessions of the American 
College of Cardiology meeting in Chicago.

one Issue as his priority and his 
pac;sion: parking. He has many 
ideas about how to increase "S~ 
!IpOtS at UCSD, Stich as creat-
ing unpaved parking spots on 
campus; seelcing co.rPOl':ltc 
sponsorships of parking spaces; 
and d,,-creasing the numbers of 
"An and "B" spaces on campus. 

Barton has no experience in 
A.S. Council, hut as be is aware 
of oouncil issues, this is not a 
pressing concern. More tron-
bling are the gaps in his knowl-
edge about parking - Ba.rton 
was not aw:are that the UCSD 
Master Plan existed, or what its 
implications fo.r parlcing were. 

However, Hso lacks con-
crete plans to execute his ideas. 
Also, he is less articulate than 
Gallagher. FinalJ}~ his support 
for A.S. resolutions and activi-
ties pertaining to national 
issues :IS opposed to C'a1TlpUS 
ones make him a less attractive 
camfldate than Gallagher. 

BRIAN UlGA The 2002-03 A.S. Council, some-times cnticized for putting too much 
rocus on external issues and not 
enough on campus matters, featured 
a successful stint by Gallagher as 
commissioner of services and enter-
prises. In Winter 2003, his colleagues 
named him "Council member or the 
Quarter" ror exhibiting a passion for 
progress this year and for completing 
goals he realistically set at the begin-
ning of his tcrm. 

Jeremy Paul 
Gallagher 

While chairing the Co-op 
Oversight commitee during the last 
school year, Gallagher fought on stu-
dents' behalf when he came to the aid 
of the Che Cafe whcn thc UCSD 
administration crackcd down on the 
content or the b'llnl.llcsd.rdu Web site. 

While Banon's carefree 
attitude and lade of preten-
$ion could inject energy into 
A.S. politics, the euarJilln 
believes he is unqualified for 
the position of A.S. president. 

The New Students First of 
the Unity Action Parking 
Wave Slate Slate~ presidential 
candidate, Brian Uiga, has 
identified an excellent priority 
for any member of student 
govemmenr. decrea5l1lg stu-
dent apathy. Uiga is passionate 
about this issue and has many 
intriguing and promising ideas 
for "inciting" the studenr body. 
Uiga also wants to focus atten-
tion on campus issues instead 
of sending council members on 
A.S.-funded trips to lobby Or 
attend con~rences.

As commissioner or !>ervices and 
cnterprises, Gallagher oversaw the 
Grove Caffe, an A.S. enterprise that 
generatcd morc profit in one quarter 
under Gallagher than it had in the 
prcvious two years combined. 
Gallagher also estimates that by 
merging the A.S. Internship Office 
with internship service at the 
Carcer Center, the council will save 
$6,000 pe r yea r. 

cnuc ror the A.S. Council. lie is cur-
rently working on merging the 
Lecture otes and oft Reserves 
enterprises to improve the efficiency 
and solvency of each. .allagher has 
also looked to generate further rev-
enue by building a ropes course, a 
joint venture ,vith UCSD recreation 
that ,viII undergo construction aftcr it 
passes through one last committee. 

Gallagher looks to accomplish 
short-term goals whilc in office, 
such as the improvemcnt of campus 
atmosphere and diversity. I Ie 
belicves that cncouraging students 
to get involved keeps them at 
UCSD, which is why he plans to 
improve runding for Triton Tide, 

Gallagher is largely reali stic 
about most long·term goals, and has 
proven that he is able and willing to 
work toward them whether he sees 
the end result come to fruition or 
not. He has proven that he can han-
dle the pressure of/arge projects and 
will work toward common goals 
with others. Gallagher's ideas have 
already yielded savings ror the A.S 
Council, a crucial element in the 
wake or funding shortfalls that have 
recently plagued univer ity services.

Kevin Hsu did not schedule an 
interview with the GutlrJitm. 
However. it is apparent from 
his candidate statement and 
the behavior of the Committee 
1.0 Elect Kevin Hsu thar his 
candidacy is not ro be taken 
seriously. The levity Hsu 
injected in the campaign was 
appreciated, but-he is hardly

and recently culminated in a 
boorish perfomlance at the 
presidential debates. Des-pite 
this, the G/IIl7dirm encourages

THE COMMISSIONERS 

Perse Hooper 
Academic Affairs 
With so many candidates running 

uncontested, it I a relief to find that Perse 
Hooper, the sole candidate for commis-
sioner of acaderruc affairs, is knowledge-
able and passionate enough to successful-
ly protect, champion and expand UCSD 
students' acadcrruc interests. 

As it stands now, there are positJons 
for students to sit on many Acaderruc 
Senate committees convened to deter-
rrune and decide acaderruc matters, but 
this year they remain empty, leaving cru-
cial student opinions unheard. Hooper's 
first priority in office will be to meet the 
challenging task of finding students for 
these critical positions. More Important-
ly, she will launch an active campaign to 
find the right people, not just seat-fillers. 
Additionally, she will pu h ro create stu-
dent positions on committees where they 
are not presently included, such as the

Jeremy Cogan 
Enterprises 

While he is runnmg unopposed for 
comrrussloner of enterpnse operauons, 
there should be no doubt that UnJty can-
didate Jeremy Cogan I~ the TIght person 
for the job. The Gllardlf/n endorses 
Cogan because of hi~ experience, Idea~ 
for improvement and enthusiasm. 

Cogan has a wealth of expenence In

served on the MUir College CouncJl for 
twO years, mdudmg tillS year when he 
served as the John MUIr ollege sopho-

Jordan Cross 
Athletics 

One of the most qualified candidates for 
his respective position on this year's ballot 
is Jordan Cross, who is running unopposed 
for commissioner of athletics. The 
GlIlJrd,an wholeheartedly endorses Cross 
for the position with extreme confidence in 
his abilities to execute the duties involved. 

In addition to spending time in the A.S. 
student ad\'ocacy office this past year, 
Cross has also been an active participant in 
Triton Tide and UCSD athletics. He has a 
definite plan for next year, including both 
long- and short-term goals for improving 
campus spirit and the athletic deparonent. 

In the short term, Cross would like to 
see Triton Tide more involved in reaehi"ll'

Communications 

While the race for commissioner of 
communications is uncontested, students 
hould have no reservations casting a vote 

for qualified and insightful Students Fir t! 
candidate Frances Galvon. 

Galvon currently serves as assistant to 
A.S. Commissioner of Communications 
Navneet Grewal and has helped allocate 
A. . funds to campus media organizations . 
Galvon hopes to garner more money from 
the council to help address the backlog of 
funding requests by several media orgs who 
have needed the funding sufficient to pro-
duce. She also plans to aid media organiza-
tions by adding suggestions in the Media 
Publication Guide on how to become more 
self-sufficient via adverti ing revenue.

in the A.S communications office is the cre-

No Confidence 
Student Advocacy 

Rarely IS a candidate for government so 
unqualified for or unsuited to the position 
for which she runs, that even If she runs 
unopposed, a vote for her would be a J11JS-
placed vOle. However, tlus is the case With 
Viv13ne Pourazary, who is the sole candidate 
for commis loner of student advocacy. 

Pour37.ary's experience for this position 
IS 1lIllllcd. While she is active on UCSD's 
Mock Trial tcam and in the Pre- Law society 
and ha~ worked With CalifornIa's Youth and 
Governmem Program and RiverSide 
County's Youth ourt Program, ~he ha;

Stephanie Aguon 
Diversity Affairs 

Stephanie Aguon has an informed and 
realistic approach to the position of com-

demonstrate that she realizes it's not just 
important to get a diverse student body 
into UCSD, but that retaining the group 
already here is also a crucial part to build -
ing and maintaining diversity on campus. 

So far, the office of Diversity Affai rs has 
only had an incomplete charter. Much of 
Aguon's job this year will be to get the 
office, which is only in its second year, off 
the ground. This includes establishing a 
budget and procuring funds to bring 
nationally recognized speakers and 
activists to inform the campus, expanding 
outreach to high school students and to 
UCSD students, and developing annual 
programs and events . Since there is no 
precedent for such an office within the UC 
system, Aguon lists sending A.S. Council

MONDAY. APRIL 7. 2oo} TIlE U [) GUARDIAN OPINION 7 

GUARDIAN A.S. ELECTION ENDORSEMENTS 
Hooper: Has 
ability to out .. 

reach and 
communicate 

conrinued from page 6 
facul ty-hiring committee, where she sees 
the greatest need for student input. 

One of the most important aspects of 
the academic affairs commi sioner's job is 
to communicate effectively with students 
about their academic need .. Hooper has 
already proven her ability to seek out Stu-
dents and acknowledge their input 
tluough her time as a core member of the 

tudenr Initiated Outreach and 
Recruitment Commission and her work in 
establishing a comprehensive outreach 
project for students on rural Indian reser-
vaoons. As a resulr of what she has heard 
from students at UCSD, she plans to 
immediately attempt to restore cour~e li st-
ings in the Women's Studies, Filipinola 
and hicanola Studies deparmlents. 

While the quality of campus life for 
tran fer tudents is on the agendas of many 
candidates, 1 looper plan to advocate for 
changes in the way transfer students are 
adnlltted, by implementing comprehensive 
review for transfer applicants, who arc cur-
rently not judged on the creativity and 
intelligence they demonstrate through 
their application essays, but rather on how 
well they have fulfilled their Transfer 
Admission Guarantee requirements. 

While she has no formal A .. experi-
ence, her outreach experienceand her 
pure enthusiasm for the task at hand more 
than qualifies her for the job. She i~ ener-
getic abolll correcting what she knows to 
be lacking on campus academically; and 
what she doesn't know, she plans to find 
out. It is doubtful that, If elected, r looper 
will not manage to tap you personally for 
your opinion in her quest to fill the acad-
emic needs of every UCSD student. 

Galvon: 
Established 

UCSD society 
of journalists 

continued from page 6 
arion of a UCSD chapter of the Society of 
Professional Journalists. Many other col-
lege across the nation have established 
SPJ branches on their campuses in order 
to give aspiring journalists the oppornlJ1i-
ty to meet with professionals who can lend 
perspective and memorship to interested 
students. The creation of an PJ chapter 
at UC 0 is even more essential, consider-
ing the lack of a journalism major, where 
prospective journalists arc never form~lIy 
instructed by professionals or FJculty, but 
rather can only learn by working III A.S . 
media orgs or tile G/la/'dwll. 

Galvon reall tically realize that tile 
campaign to acquire an FM frequency for 
the KSDT radio statt n is probably dead, 
and contend that concentrating on a goal 
that seems unattainable in the hort term 
i a wa. te of time and energy by her office. 
Instead, she wishes to focus on projects 
that are more reali tic and beneficial, such 
as the creation of an A. . new letter that 
would promote efforts put forth by the 
A.S. Council and its offices, student orga-
nization and undergraduate at large. 

Galvon also wi he to empower 
media organizations by constructing a 
Students Media Rights Guide and by 
coordinating a Know Your Rights cam-
paign for all students. Thi is crucial to 
the livelihood of campus media in the 
wake of the U SO adl11ini tratlon's 
attempts to reprimand Tht Koala and the 
bllrn.1I J.tJu Web sire for their content. 

Galvon wJlI fund media organizations 
wilh content-neutrality, basing deCisions 
upon merit uch a frequency of publi -
cation and longevity. The Gllard,all 
believes .alvon is the right choice for 
commissioner of communications. 

Cogan: Will 
institute meal 

points at Grove 
Caffe 

continued from page 6 
into. Cogan will have the Grove Caffe, 
which, in fall quarter, yielded a profit for the 
first time in two years. Cogan plans to con-
tinue such improvements. Cogan said that 
he would like to see the Grove accept meal 
points, which he said would increase profits 
even more. I Ie said that he would also be 
going over the bllSines practices of the 
Grove, A. . L.ecture otes and A.S. Soft 
Reserves in dn attempt to maxirruzc effi-
ciency and profitability. 

\Vith regard to future enterprises, 
Cogan said that a ropes course could be in 
place as early as next year on the UCSD 
campus. He said that it would be an A.S. 
enterprise that could be used by not only 
the UCSD campus community, but the 
surrounding community as well. Even 
though his campaign to put an A.S. enter-
prise in the Price Center Game Room 
after its renovation failed, Cogan said thar 
he would like to pursue the possibility of 
an A. . enterprise cart that would be 
located in Price Center and possibly serve 
ice cream or any other treat that rudents 
might want. 

Cogan shows a high level of compe-
tence for the job and should have no prob-
lem as next year's A.S. commissioner of 
enterprise operation . 

Shah: Wants

festivals 
commued from page 6 

gramming commi sioner has enormous 
and stressful tasks, and the sooner Shah is 
familiar with the inner workings of the 
programming office, the better the pro-
gramming office will be. 

One of the things that hah would like 
to sec done is to improve the headliner at 
each of the festivals . In order to do this , 

hah would like to ee money directed 
toward the headliner. I Ie also advocates 
keeping allocations targeted toward the 
larger festivals, since these arc the events 
each quarter thar draw the most students. 

Shah is well aware of the trengths and 
weakne ses of this year's programming 
office and is offering various ways to 
improve programming next year. ne 
such improvement that Shah would like to 
see implemented is the hiring of people 
more suited toward marketing, publicity 
and public relations. l Ie would also like to 
work more with the community and the 
press to get the word out about the various 
event~ that are promoted through the .5. 
Council . 

In order to work more with the com-
munity, Shah advocates ~ r d largcr st:tff 
that would go out and find out what stu-
dents would like to see in terms of pro-
gramming. Ilowever, hah doe n't think 
an online submission for:n would be good 
for learning more about students' prefer-
ences. The Gllardiall disagrees with thi 
since the use of an on line form would let 
more students have a voice as to who they 
would like to sec perform at festival . 
Furthermore, this would reduce the size 
of staff needed to reach out to the tu-
dents. With Shah advocating a greater 
and specialized staff, manpower could 
become a eriou problem and the nece -
sity of finding the right people for the job 
becomes ever more important. 

Programming i one of tlle very few 
thmgs on campus that Jraw students 
together. The GIiI/I'd,all hopes hah i fully 
aware of hiS weighty respoll Jbilitie and 
en urages him to ahsorb a much mfor-
matlon as he can to ensure that all fe u-
vals, especially Sun ,od, will be the event 
that all students mu~t go to. 

Advocacy: 
She is ignorant 
of Principles of 

Community 
cominued from page 6 

side counsel in academic dishonesty ca es 
- a priori ty the Gllard,an supportS 
wholeheartedly - she naively supposed 
that Director of Student Policy and 
Judicial Affairs Nick Aguilar would 
accedc easily to this request, and that he 

wOl~d similarly support her pro po al to 
place more snldents on the Policies and 
Procedures Manual committee. 

Also, though one ofPourazarys stated 
campaign promises is to expand the 
"Know Your Rights" campaign, she her-
self had no Idea what UC D 's Principles 
of Community were - or their implica-
tions for student rights. 

And finally and most disturbingly, 
Poura'1.3ry di played an insufficient com-
mltlnent to the crucial student right 010 t 
frequently under attack at CSD: free-
dom of expression. \,vhen asked if she 
would defend a student si lenced by the 
admiltiStration for expressing racist beliefs 
on Library Walk, he said she would not 
because that student would have been vio-
lating other students' "rights" - forget-
ong that while the Consitution guarantees 
us the right to freedom of speech, it does 
not outline any righr to be protected from 
offensive material. Pourazary also said she 
would not have defended the Che Cafc in 
their latest administrative run-in over-
Internet links to terrorist organi'1.3tions. 

The GuardIan does not doubt that 
Poura'1.3ry will be elected thi week, as she 
will surely remember to vote for herself. 
However, our grave rrusigivings about her 
ability to advocate appropriately and 
effectively for UCSD's tudent body 
make it il11po ible for us to endor e her. 

Vasant: 
Supports better 
communication 
between depts 

continued from page 6 
However, she al 0 wants to increase 

the ability for all tudents to have access 
to their academic counselors. he also 
empha izes the need for greater commu-
nication between college and depart-
ment advisors. Vasant would like to ee a 
program created so that all students can 
be gil'en a chance and a time to meet 
With their academic counselor at least 
once a quarter. The GlIard,an does ques-
tion how such a I Ierculean effort can be 
accomplished. in light of the impacted 
schedule that counselors already have. 

Va ant also expressed intere t in creat-
ing greater tie among students by having 
all-campus dances once a quarter and 
tr:m fer-student dinner . These unifying 
events would make the campus more 
active and sociable. Although these ideas 
could be e rablished in conjunction with 
the programming office, it i Important to 
note that Va. ant has ideas on creating a 
conductive environment among students. 

Another possibility that Vasant would 
look IntO is streamlini ng student services 
hy looking at a ll the services that are 
offered and seeing what service could be 
merged. Thi would give students an 
easy location to go to, instead of going to 
various ervicr :;round campus. 

otlllg the budget cuts in the nldent 
affairs department, Vasant i open to the 
po ibtlity of uSing .S. morue to fund 
nOI1- .. ervices uch as O . .. 1.S. and 
shurtle service. A .. funding i already 
Impacted a it i , and the Guard,all 
encourages \'asant to lobby the adnuni -
trauon to not cut student services. The 
student services commi sioner hould 
not only maintain A. .-funded tudent 
se rvices, but hould also ellSure that all 
other ervice are there for rudents. 

Fee Referendum 

Yes 

This yea r's ballot 
will include a fee ref-
erendum, asking If 
an additional $6.75 
quarterly fee should 
be assessed in addi-
tion to the exi~ti ng 
$2 I activity fee. Thi~ 
fcc is necessary, and 
ItS passage will 
increase the quality 
of student life. 

The A.S. 
Council ha a $1.2 million budget, gar-
nered primarily through the $63 paid 
annually by each UCSD undergraduate. 
Although this seems like a lot, ir has 
become less adequate o\'er the past few 
years as the number of tudent organJ7..a-
tions has mcreased faster than the A.S. bud-
get. Increased enrollment, as well as the 
distinct possibility of eliminattng freshman 
parking, mandates that the council hold 
more concerts and events to entertain the 
on-campus residents. With no parking, 
freshmen will not have cars to get them to 
off-campus entertainment I'enues, making 
on-campus entertainment more Important. 

Commuters also benefi t from a fee 
increase. More money for the A .. 
Council means more concerts and more 
funding for the student organizations that 
many commuters ee as their only 
nonacademiC links to UCSD. 

The A . . budget IS already ;trained. 
The past two councils have dipped into the 
mandate reserve fund - the equivalent of 
"deficit pending." The fee increase will 
provide about another $300,000, givtng 
the council the flexibility to prevent this 
for the forseeable future . More money also 
allows the council to tnvest in new money-
making enterprises, further strengthening 
the councils financial situation. 

Finally, this fee increase differ In one 
impo ant way from the fee increases thrust 
upon UCSD students by the UC Regents 
earlier tlus year: The students have control 
over this money. Resr assured that all of t1llS 
money will be distributed by students. 

For the e reasons, U 0 should vote 
to approve the 6.75 quarterly actJvity fee 
this week. 

Comm i ssioners 
On the constitu-

tional amendment 
to change COITlJl1JS-
sioners from elected 
to a ppointed POSI-
tions, we strongly 
urge a "no" vore. 

The A. com-
mi sioners arc 
charged With 

.,.. TO defending 5tudents' 
J... '4 I Tights, II1crcasmg 

diversity, running 
A. . enterprises and . . lecture note, 
and representing students before the 
Academic Senate, among other thing 
Making these positions appointed Instead 
of elected takes power away from the VOt-
ing student electorate and throws it into 
the hands of the A . . Council. 

It i imperative that these commls ion-
ers continue to be held accountable to the 
will of the voting tudents, not to politi -
cian looking to reward their consoruents. 
To do otherwi e would be to open our 
student government to the poSSibility of a 
spoils system like that of the nattonal gov-
ernment, where loyal campaign contribu-
tor arc granted plum position for their 
upport during election ea on. 

Contrary to the "Pro" starement in tlle 
sample ballot, this amendment nukes the 
commiSSIOner positions 1/I0l't political, 
sinct they will be appoinreu by politiCians 
in tead of elected by students. Indeed. all 
positions become more political, with the

LmERS TO THE EDITOR 
Uiga totally un'lualified 

for A.S. presidency 
Editor: 

The A.S. debate on Apri l 3 was a 
sad and pathetic display of 
stupidity. Brian Uiga and his group 
of idiots have proven that they have 
neither the maturity nor the self-dis-
cipline to be in 011Y type of leader-
ship position. He claims to want to 
erve one of dle most prestigious 

universities in the nation, yet his 
answer to opposition is to say, "F-k 
you," and Aip off the odler candi-
dates. He claims to be the only one 
with brains, telling me aftcr the 
debate, "I'm a mechanical engineer. 
Who t are you? A political science 
major?" lIe then began to dance 
around like a monkey, saying, "( 
have the brams. I have the brains." 
Uiga has shown that he has no 
brains. ot once h3 he ever aid 
anything of substance. I Ie simply 
prefers to sa}' "F-k you" to all of 
those that do not agree with him. 

[s this how he would run the A.S . 
meeting) By screaming obscenities 
and not allowing anyone else to 
speak) pparenLiy he believes that 
only the superior me hamcal engi-
neer mind can be put into this cov-
eted po ition and people, such as 
political science majors, do not have 
enough brainpower for even the 
SImplest of tasks. Uiga' dl gusting 
and pathetic display proves he has 
none of the so-called "brains" that it 
takes to be A.S. president. The pre -
ident of Associated Students in the-
ory hould represent the tudent 
bod}'- Do we, as students, want a 
dancing idiot to represent us? This 
coming week I look forward to VOt-
ing ogoJIIst Bnan Uiga.

Editor: 

This is an open lerler to all per-
sons who have found offense with 
my actions at the UCSD presIden-
tial debates. 

I sincerely feel that student apa-

goals are

contmued from page 6 

would like to see rallies before 
games to get school pirit going and 
to hopefully increase anendance. An 
idea to get students inv Ived early is 
to give Triton Tide T-shirts to 
freshmen during freshman onenta-
oon. One of his ideas for getting 
more students to games IS to rnalee 
games into events wiul more than 
athletic attractions. 

For his long-term goals, Cross 
wants to launch task force to look 
into the pOSSIbIlity of athletic 
scholar hips and an eventual move 
into DIvision 1. While he acknowl-
edges that these thmgs are still a 
long way from reality, he feels that 
It IS Important to start to look IOtO

not only improve the quality of ath-
letics on campus, but to also 
Improve campus life a a whole. 

thy is the No. I problem on this 
campus. 

T he outcome of·my spectacle at 
the Price Center can be summed up 
in the following way: At least 300 
people will not vote for me because 
they find my actions disgusting. 
Perhaps 100 people will vote for mc 
because they are tired of the preten-
sion surrounding the A.S. elections. 

As a candidate, rIo e. 
BlIt [ have forced the apathy sur-

rOW1ding the A.S. elections out of 
perhaps 400 people, and frankly, I 
don't care ifI win as long as the stu-
dents are impassioned enough to do 
something about those in power. I 
congrarulate anyone who insults me, 
for they have found their voice. 
Consider running for office next ycar 
if your passion decides to continue. 

I will be on Library Walk during 
dle next week asking people what is 
wrong with UC D. 1 trongly urge 
you to come out and tell me that I 
am what is wrong with UCSD.

Campustruth.org ads 
are anything but truthful 
Editor: 

I am extremely dismrbed by the 
compustruth.olg ads that appeared in 
your newspaper on March 3 I and 
April 3. I find these ads extremely 
offensive because of their blatant 
propaganda that attempts to pro-
mote an anti-Palestinian entiment 
on this campus. From a newspaper 
that claims to "reserve the right to 
refuse advertiSing which has 
ob cene, sexist, racIst or other con-
tent deemed inappropriate" (as 
stated in the ad policie on the 
GuardIan Web site), , do not know 
how to react to the publication of 
the C011lPIJrlnltb.OIg ads, except wi th 
disbelief and shock. I certainly 
expect that the edItors of this news-
paper would have bener judgment 
than to accept money for an adver-
tisement that to me seems so 
inAammatory. If an organization 
approached your newspaper with 

an ad degrading women, blacks, 
Latinos or gays, then would this 
newspaper accept money and print 
the ad? I could never imagine a 
campus newspaper allowing racist 
or sexist ads to be printed. The pur-
pose of a newspaper seems so clear 
to me: give its readers the fa ts, not 
feed them propaganda based on 
venomous stereotypes. 

I am very disappointed in this 
newspaper, but more importantly 
very frightened by the presence of 
these ads. By llccepting to print 
the e ads, your editors have obvi-
ously deemed them clear of racist or 
inappropriate content. I do not 
think that I am alone when r say that 
the degradation of Palestinians, let 
alonc any ethnic group for thiS mat-
ter. is inappropriate and lacklllg in 
the most f~undalllcntal value~ of 
acceptance and respect. The root of 
the stereotypes presented in these 
ads is deeply ba.ed on hatred and a 
complete lack of consideration and 
compassIOn for others. Similar ads 
have already appearcd in othcr cam-
pus newspapers around the country 
where they have sorred criticism 
and outrage. Student at Florida 
State Unlvcr;ity, niversity of 
Michigan and Rutgers University, 
to name a few, have all expressed 
vehement OPPOSItion to the pres-
ence of these ads in their respecoI'e 
school publications. 

Is there any hope for a world 
free of hatred? Pcrhap one might 
con ider me a naive optimist, but 1 
do very strongly believe that we 
can live in a world without the 
presence of malice and misguided 
intentions. I Iowever, the existence 
of such ads greatly discourage. 
me. 'n the fu ture, I hope this 
newspaper will properly enforce 
its stated advertiSIng policy, and 
think twice heforc accepting 
money to pram inAallllllutory and 
prejudIced ads.

Kevin Shawn Iisu stressed the 
importance of working with and 
improving srudent organizations 
and events as the central compo-
nent of improving student life at 
UCSD: "Student orga ni zations 
arc the lifeblood of our university." 

Gallagher, who is currently the 
.\ .S . commissioner of services and 
enterprises, plans to get students 
IIlvolved in various organizations 
and promote anendance to off-
campus events, such as UCSD 
SpOrtlllg event. 

"\ e need to really activate and 
motivate the students. Jetting 
involved is essential in campus 
life," Gallagher said. "When peo-
pic feel that they are involved, they 
feci like they belong here and want 
to suy here." 

[n addition, Gallagher want to 
promote outreach from the .S. 

ouncil to get more students 
IIlvolved in decision-making in the 
~tudent governmell! and school 
administration. 

Uiga provided a simple solution 
to improvmg student life at UC D. 

"The way to improve stud~nt 
life on thi campus is to make it 
more fun because right now it is 
really boring - its terribly boring. 
The reason why is nobody is willing 
to get involved," Uiga said, blaming 
past A.S. cOW1ci ls for the poor qual-
ity of snldenr life at UCSD. 

. Barton blamed the poor quality 
of student life on the problems 
\Vlth students parking. 

"We have to worry about park-
ing first, and thcn we can worry 
about the e other lofty goals. 
ParkJOg has to come first, and then 
we can have some fun. , plan to

people to park their cars." 

The parking problems Barton 
touched on were the next subject 
the ca ndidate was asked to address. 

Barton opened the debate on 
the heated subject, expresSlIlg out-
rage about parking fees and exces-
~Ive tickeong. 

"I am going to find out where 
that money goes and who is in 
charge of it," he said . '" am going 
to make him accountable to the 
tudents." 

Barton also blamed the current 
A.S. ounci l for the loss of student 
pots. 

"They lost 1,200 [""] paces 
under their watch," Barton said. 

Barton gave many of hIS ideas 
on how he would increase studcnt 
parking, including allowing

continued from page I 

This is the third consecutive

first successful farm workers' 
union in U.S. hi story. H e led 
numerous peaceful demonstra-
tions, including the na tionwide 
boycon of grapes and many long 
fasts and marches. 

"[He was] a voice for the voice-
less," aid Polanco in his speech. 
"lIe was a hero not just to the 
Latino community, but to all peo-
ple that believe in dignity, respect 
and human rights ." 

"Viva Ce ar Chavezl" Polanco 
then cried out three times, to the 
resulting cheers of the crowd. 

The event wa sponsored by 
the UCSD Cesar E. Chavez

ous red and black balloons, eating

performance from a Lanno chorus, 
who were draped in colorful pon-
chos and guitars. They watched 
UC D srudent group La Joya de

their flower-like cosrumes. The 
crowd even rose together to sing. 

One of the many students 
inging along was Chris Hiestand, 

an Eleanor Roosevelt College 
junior. 

" I'm having a good time," 
I hestand said. "But why I'm here 
- In my high school AP U .. 
) JIStory class, I never learned 
about Chavez. I'm here to find Out 
more about him." 

One of the first speakers" as 
Elsa Sevilla, a freelance journal-
ist involved with many popular 
news shows, such as "America's 
10st Wanted" and "Good 

Morning America." She began 
her speech with a moment of 
ilence to honor the U .S. troops 

in Iraq. 
"These festivities honor a great 

man," evilla said. 
The onlooki ng crowd flocked 

to a photo exhibition at the front 
of the amphitheater after the 
speakers were fini hed. Tables and 
easels held a number of large 
black-and-white prints depicting 
the landmarks of Chavez's life by 
photographers juan Lopez and

holiday is not about a day of rest. 

"[The holiday] should always 
remind us of the work of farm-
workers and other working men 
and women," Polanco said. " fIt 
will] honor the contribution farm-
workers have given from the 
begi nning of time to the present 
- the food that nourishes us and 
our children. My hope i that

sue UC Regents 

Suit over withholding 
investment documents 

By NEIL SPEARS 
Staff Writer 

A lawsuit fi led against tile UC 
Regents on April I alleges that the 
Regents are violating the 
California Public Records Act by 
refu ing to release documents 
related to the performance of indi-
vidual venture capital inve5t1nents 
in the UC pension funds. 

The Son Jose MtrCllry News, the 
Coalition of University Employees 
and Charles L. Schwartz are plain-
tiffs in the suit, alleging these docu-
ments will provide evidence that 
the university has mismanaged the 
funds . 

The university claims that the 
documents, transcripts and tape 
recordinb'S of closed-door meetings 

" 

judy Alexander, an attorney for 
the Mercm) News, believes it was 
not appropriate for the Regents to 
hold decisions regarding pol icy 
changes in fund strategies during 
do ed sessions. 

" We understand perfectly that 
there are needs fo r private ses-
sions," Alexander said . " But when 
they ' re talking about general 
investment strategy and whether 
they' re goi ng to put more money 
in private equity funds, or they' re 
going to put more money in pub-
lic companies, or they're going to 
put more money in bonds , then) 
think those general strategy and 
policy discussions should be held 
in public." 

Schwartz, professor emeritus of 
physics at UC Berkeley, has been

ques tions a bout

and the integrity of 
the regents and 

by state offices be - Childes L Schwartz, UC 
available for public Berkeley professor 
review. 

UC spokesperson Trey Davis 
believes that the release of the doc-
uments would expose information 
that is sensitive to the way venture 
capital firms conduct business. 

"The danger in being forced to 
dlsdose that information is that 
these companies simply won't do 
business with public institutions 
that have those requirements," 
Davis said. "That then locks [the 
university] out of a whole tier of 
highly lucrative inve tment oppor-
tunities." 

The university currently releas-
es aggregate data on fund perfor-
mance, but does not specify indi-
vidual investment data, known as 
the internal rate of return. 

"Si nce the money lhat [the 
Regents] are investing is our pen -
sion fund, we're very concerned 
about it," said Margy Wilkinson , 
chief negotiator for C.U.E. "We 
heheve that they are malung some 
very unWlse InveSllTlem decislon~." 

their inVeStlllent advisors, based 
upon my critical studies of the 
available public record," said 
Schwartz in an pril3 message. "A 
lawsuit is the last, but nece sary, 
resort to get the truth out." 

"California's flagship educatlon-
al institution is behind the urnes 
and below the sta ndard for fu ll dis-
closure," said Karl Ison, atto rney 
for C.U.E. "The public has a right 
10 know how UC is Inve ting bil-

A hearing on the case will be 
held May 12 in the Alameda 
County Superior ourt. 

At the close of the fiscal year 
ending june 30, 2002, UC retire-

those who participated," sa id 
Roosevelt Freshman Senator Max 
l ia rrin gton . "The prod uct they 
came up with was what was a ked 
for, and I and others have been con-
tinually impressed by their progress 
reports, presentations and dedica-
tion." 

The proposed referendum 
included the expansion of offices 
and the Co-op stores in the Snldent 
Center and the addition of food 
services in Price Center. Nonfood 
retail services, including a full -ser-
vice bank, grocery store and an 
expanded Post Office will also be 
added. 

"I'm disappointed because the 
sena te is elected to speak for the 
snldents, and to be the student 
voice in the student government," 
sa id University Centers Advisory 
Board Chair and task force member 
James Lynch . "\ Vith so many sena -
tors supporting it, it's a litde dis-
heartening to know that the stu-
dent voice is nOt being listened to." 

However, according to John 
Muir College Sophomore enator 
jeremy Cogan, the concern is not 
on tile wording of the referendum 
itself, but on the limited discussion 
of other possi ble options. When 
Brown submitted the amendments 
to the referendum, a motion was 
passed limiting council member 10 
talk only about the referendum as it 
was presented by the UCETF. 

"Even though I'm 100 pe rcent 
in favor for the referendum and 
expansion, I felt that discussion was 
limited and we weren't given the 
chance to discuss them," said 

ogan, who abstained from the 
vote. "If we want expansion to hap-
pen, it should be somethi ng that 
counCil is almost unanimous on. I 
want to see the referendum P,ISS, 
but In order to do that we need 3n 
A. . Counci l that is united." 

Brown also expressed the same 
concerns regarding the lack of dl -
cuss lon and debate dUring last 
week's meenng. Another concern, 
according to Brown, i the po ibil-
ity of a counter-campaign that 
might be oppo ed to expansion. 

ul felt it nece sary to veto the 
legis lation to bri ng rise to the voic-
es at the table that were not heard ," 
Brown said. " I feel it is really 
important that in making a deci ion 
about Price Center expansion, we 
l(Jok ctlllcallr at which W;IY it ha; a 
beller chance to pas~ ." 

For some members of the 
CETF, the delay also means 

pu;hlllg back the campaign neces-
sary for the passing of the referen-
dum. According to UCETF C hair 
Carn Bournoutian, the t a~k force 
will sti ll prepare to run the referen-
dum ,md keep ItS seventh-week 
deadlrnc, at which time students 
wrll be able to vote for it. 

" I t can be done, as long ,I' ques-
liOns arc answered by thiS \I cck's 
meeting." Bournoutian SJid . "I feel 
(hJt there ha; been plenty of ante to 
d,stu, the Issue and It has jU;,t heen 
pushctl hack and pushed b,lck." 

A.S. se nator~ Will have the 
opportunity to override the veto 
at this week's meeting. In order 
for the veto be ovcrruled, there 
Illll~t be a two- thirds vote. In the 
event of failing to ge t the reqUired 
votcs, a new referendum wlil be 
redrawn . 

" I feci that With a very compre-
hensive and well -facilitated dl'cu -
IOn, the four vote of abstenllons, 

IncluulIlg my elf, could take the 
lillie to either vore affirmative or 
ncgallve," sa id MUir Freshm31l 
Senator Nam Sui . " I thi nk that we 
could possibly cOllle to some kind 
of compromise that would not 
result In both s ide haVing to sacri-

.fice their Intentions and goal ."

Hunger: UCSD groups participate in citywide cleanup 
continued from /)age I I 

budget CUtS both at the federal and 
local leve ls, the e programs need 
our help more than ever." 

Over th e last 19 years, the 
I Junger Cleanup has involved over 
125,000 volunteers and raised over 
$1 .5 million. Money raised will 
benefit local, national and interna -
tional rel ief programs. Of the 
funds raised at Saturday'S event, 50 
percent will benefit the Cortez 
Hill Family Center, a local San 
Diego hunger and homeles ness 
relief agency. 

Each volunteer organization 
was sent to different sites around 
the San Diego area to help in any 
way it could for the day. 
Assignments ranged from working 
at shelters, to cleaning up and 
beautifying after-school program 
sites, to landscaping and painting 
hOll es. In addition to donating 
services, each organization raised 
money toward this year's goal of 
$2,000. 

"Bei ng college students, we do 
have a lot of extra time 011 our 
hands," sa id Revelle College 
junior Dustin Wong of AACF. "It's 
good to use that time to do some-
thing productive and beneficial to 
the community." 

In addition to monetary aid, 
the CAHH also aim to pro-

mote awareness and advocacy for 
the increa, ing poverty level in 
the United States. According to 
the U.S. Censlls Bureau, the 
number of individuab living 
below the poverty level in the 
United States increased by 1.3 
million during the past year, rais-
ing the national tOlal to 32 .9 mil-
lion peopl e. 

One of the main legislative pri-
orities for the SCAlll I and one 
of the Hunger Cleanup's major 
advocacy campaigns for 2003 is the 
reauthorization of the governments 
Temporary Assistance for Needy 
Families program. TANF provides 
$ 16.9 million per year in food, med-
ical care, childcare, shelters and 
other services for low-income fami-
lies. CalPIRG and the NSCAHH 
see this as a gtea t opporruni ty for 
Congress to close the gap between 
need and resources available by the 
government. 

"Advocacy and education is a 
major part of Hunger Cleanup and 
the hunger campaign," Kermani 
said. "We do community service, 
but we also feel we need to push 
for legislation that helps the 
poverty sinlation in this country. 
That's what really makes a differ-
ence in the long run." 

To aid in this goal, each vol un-
teer individually signed lette rs

Deep rools °in shaky ground 
A glimpse at 
the trials and 
tribulations of 
Groundwork 

Books 

Story and photos by 

Hono Hsu, 
Senior Stoff Writer 

Most students have all inkling that, besides 
being an alternative campu bookstore to the 
UCSD Bookstore in the Price Center, 
Groundwork Books is also a poliocal, com-
munity-oriented, student-run co-op. But 
most students do not know how long 
Groundwork Books ha been around, how 
hard it is has fought to smy rooted on the 
UC D campus and the difficulties it still 
faces. 

tarting in 1979 as a metal cart wheeled 
around Revelle College, Groundwork Books 
has grO\\~1 il1lo a major te~lbook ource for 
students. Professors in the humanitic; and 
social sciences now commonly place book 
order through It. But as students and faculty 
have expressed, ItS also more than just a 
bookstore. 

Ethnic Studie professor Charle ' Briggs 
aid, "[because] mone)'-making isn't the 

only goal there, [Groundworkl gives u a 
model of how we can think about building a 
community that not only serves the particu-
lar needs of an organization, but at the same 
time, the vast number of interests and need 
that are held by the members of the com-
munity." 

Worker arah Espino explains, "It's not 
ju t like a textbook tore, it's like a general 
bookstore, and we al 0 have events ... politi-
cally oriented [like] Zapitista events." 

The University Center Web ite 
describes Groundwork a offering "books 
and media off the beaten path," including a 
small video library for rental. Groundwork 
is also heavily upponed by volunteers, like 
Thurgood Marshall ollege freshman Julie 

anchel., who wa attracted by the opportu-
nity to contribute to a liberal cause. 

As ,roundwork defines itself on a red 
po ter inside the store, it is a "political collec-
tive" that trives to build lhe "groundwork" 
for a funlfe "nonhierarchical and n nauthor-
itarian system of oclal organization." 

The necessity of improvements is evi-
denced by the fi r t week of the quarter, 
which bring lines that spill out of the 
cramped bookstore. tudent . ometime 
have trouble finding their books, which may 
be on the floor. Bookshelve become 
dividers for students to squeeze around as 
they form a line to pay. . 

"I was here yesterday, I am here tooay and 
I have a class in ten minutes," aid Jessica 

Calm before the storm: Here Groundwork Books appears peaceful before the first week of the 
quarter; a rush of students purchasing textbooks will create massive lines to get Into the boo store 

nllen, a lransfer student in John Muir 
College. "Every time I come in here, it IS a 
ridiculously long line." 

Recognizing the limitations of the mostly 
volLUltcer smff, Muir junior Jonathan Ying 
Sdid, "I find it ludicrous, but I can't really 
blame them because these are tudcnt volun-
teers. They can't control how many students 
come in here ... Blame it on the UC Regents." 

Groundwork workers and volunteers 
admit to these hortcomings and are frustrat-
ed with the limited space. 

"We don't have adequate space," said vol-
lmteer worker Laura Macintyre. "Becausc of 
thaI, we can't do used textbooks as much." 

I lowe vcr, Macintyre also POll1ts OUI that 
providing tc tbooks at all is" omething fatrly 
recent" si nce GrOlmdwork mainly provi les 
books fr III II1depcndem pubh hers. 

"rlt was surted] as 3 fa\'Or to faculty mem-
bers tha t upponcd us," he aid. 

"Now faculty members who don't even 
know what we're about place orders Wllh us. 
We're n I really cut Ollt to do that." 

The student workers also aid thu 
GrOlllldwork has tried to atuin a second f1001' 
in the past, but plans for exp.lJlSion have 

always failed, accordmg to ladntyrc. 'he 
has worked for GroLUldwork slllce 19 9 and 
rerurned to volunteer after graduaong. 

Macintyre recalls the ~truggles she's seen 
in GroLUldworks dealings WIth the LUll vcr ity. 

"The university has continuously tried to 
get us out of this pace becau e they feel we're 
directly competing with the bookstore," she 
said. "We're nOt, we're a co-op, we're a non-
profit org-mization and wc're JUSt trying to 
provide what wc can to the students and to 
the general an Diego community."

the editors' 
soapbox 

Wait, I thought we were 
all in college to learn? 

Jessica 
Li.ngel 

Many tudent now attending 
universitie for all the wrong reasons 

I n a lot of ways, college hasn't 
cxacdy been what I thought it 
would be. The work load ha been 
about a demanding as I'd 
assumed, and just as I'd imagined, 
there have been interesting classes 
to take and a lot of things to learn. 
The thing that's been the biggest 
urprise for me over the past two 

years isn't so much college itself, 
but rather the motivations behind 
people mending it. 

I didn't come to school to "find 
myself," nor did 1 come to be able 
ro earn more money when I 
joined the workforce. The only 
motivation that made me want to 
attend chool was the idea of 
learning. I'm all tOO aware that 
this makes me a dork, which does-
n't come as a surprise to anyone 
who knows me. I may in fact be 
the biggest dork on the face of the 
planet. I read about 30 books a 
year, I can recite all the presidents 
in chronological order and I can 
probably tell you which hockey 
team has won the tanley Cup in 
any given year since 1934. 
Dorkiness aSide, I graduated high 
school eagerly looking forward to 
being able to spend all my time 
learning what I wanted to learn 
because that's something 1 have 
genull1ely enjoyed all my life: 
learmng. 

Flash forward to 2003, and 
here I am wondering what the hell 
it is that most other people are 
dOing here. If you think I'm exag-
gerating my clai m that there are 

" There is something very 
wrong when a group of 

students admits to 
becoming a student 

only to become rich or 
better Cl4uaimed with 

themsel{ es. " 
people at UCSD who should real-
ly and truly be ashamed of being 
here, bear with me. True story: I 
was in a lower-division political 
science course discussion, and the 
TA asked us to raise our hands 
when she listed various reasons 
for going to school. To my abject 
horror, about 25 of the 30 lads 
said that they came to earn more 
money. Four agreed that they 
were here to "find themselves." 

ot to sound overly preachy or 

self-serving, but I was the only 
kid who would admit to coming 
to school to learn. 

There is something very wrong 
when a group of students admits 
to becoming a student only to 
become rich or better acquainted 
with themselves. Both are severe 
insults to the pursuit of education, 
and should be seen as such. 

College hould not be the 
place you go to make money. 
Perhaps I'm biased in that I don't 

understand why anyone would 
devote themselves solely to mak-
ing money, which seems so ridicu-
lously shallow and superficial as to 
not even merit a serious fraction 
of educational motivation. ote 
that I don't equate money with 
success, nor do I comprehend 
people who do. r would have 
understood if people said that 
they wanted to attend school to be 
successful, but not for the horren-
dously capitalistic venture of 
wanting to be rich. 

I'm probably idealizing here, 
and r recognize that. I probably 
shouldn't expeCt people to come to 
college simply to study. I probably 
shouldn't actually suggest that we 
set aside things like greed and envy. 
But I don't think it's so ridiculously 
illogical to sugge t that education 
should be above that. There is 
omething intrinSically valuable 

about knowledge. To corrupt that 
value with an actual dollar amount

would support Groundwork. 
Board Chair of the University 

Center Advisory Board (UCAB) 
James Lynch was surprised to hear 
about Groundwork 's desire for 
expansion. 

"Gary Ratcliff approached the 
co-ops last spring, and all the co-ops 
gave a cold response ... I've been on 
UCAB for three years, and this is 
tbe first I've heard of it," he said. 

MacIntyre is skeptical about the 
expan ion process due to past deal-
ings with the university. 

"One of the things they're talk-
ing about now is expanding ... 
However, because of their lack of 
faith and the way that they've 
negotiated with us in the past , 
we're very suspicious. We cannot 
trust them, we have no reason to 
trust them," she said. 

In addition, Groundwork also 
faces competition from the UCSD 
Bookstore. 

"Now, we're not competing 
with [Price Center]. If a professor 
orders with them, we don't carry 
their books. What they do is come 
in and take our bookJist ... and 
they'll start providing [books] to 
undercut us. They use really preda-
tory monopolistic practices to get 
us out of business," Macintyre said. 

Still, for those who want to help 
Groundwork, there are ways to 
contribute, such 3S volunteering 
like Macintyre and Sanchez. 

" If you don't like the lines, come 
help us Out. We have a volunteer 
discount of 27 percent," Macintyre 
said. 

Although expansion may be a 
touchy subject and currendy not 
included in the referendum pro-
posal, Falkenstein say that if Stu-
dents want Groundwork to be 
expanded, they can lobby the A .. 
Council. For now, it seems that as 
long as Groundwork is around, so 
will the lines.

ARENA UCSD Bike Shop 
broadens scope What is the best part of spring quarter? 

Skateboarding equipment and 
services now offered on campus 

Interviews by Barri Worth, photos by Tyler Huff 

By ANNIE YANG 
Contributing Writer 

While many UCSD students 
choose to walk around campus 
every day, so me students prefer 
hiking or skateboardi ng as more 
expedient forms of transporta-
tion. 

For almost 35 years, snldents 
have been able to receive services 
for their bicycle needs at an on-
campu location. The UCSD Bike 
Shop, which is located In the Old 
Student Center, specializes in bicy-
cle repair and maintenance while 
offering a variety of bicycle-related 
equipment and parts aimed to 
ensure both a safe and fu n ride for 
its customers. 

However, as skateboards have 
had a growing appeal with the stu-
dem population, the UCSD Bike 
Shop has recently begun to offer 
skateboard parts to meet the incre-
mcmal demands from the ska te-
boarding crowd. 

"What happened is that a lot 
of Jlcopl e requested bearings, 
truck nllts and other type of parts 
so we began to offer a whole 
selection of them," sa id Kris 
\Vells, manager of the UC 0 
Bike Shop and former C D stu-
dent. 

Pan of the reason that the Bike 
Shop decided to market skate-
boarding equipment is that the 
hop hopes and expects to attract 

traffic while extending its services 

to satisfy the needs of those stu-
dents who own skateboards. 

"r t also creates an additional 
service offered on the UCSD 
ca mpus and serves as a good addi-
tion that will keep people coming 
to the tudent Center," Wells 
said. 

In the ccnter of the Bike Shop 
alongside a rack of bicycles, a vari-
ety of skateboard decks with such 
brands as flip , Element, Lib Tech, 
Blacklabel , horty's, Lucky and 
ATM are on display with other 
skateboarding paraphernalia such 
as bearings, wheels and trucks. 
Replacement hardware such as 
truck nuts and bolts, kinpins and 
bolts, grip tape, stickers and ri er 
plates are also available. 

Wells has been shopping 
around at most of the local board 
shops in San Diego, mainly located 
in Pacific Beach and Encinitas, to 
compare and match prices. 

"The Bike Shop offers prices 
that are pretty competitive because 
;tudents don't want to spend a lot 
of money," Wells said. 

While the sale of skateboarding 
pans reflects recent expansions, the 
Bike Shop has undergone qUite a 
few changes sillce its inception in 
1968. The Bike hop first started 
operating in a Quanz3 hut located 
in Eleanor Roosevelt College. 
Basic services such as replacing flat 
tires and oiling services were pro-

I'm not denounCing people who

I spent all my childhood looking 
forward to college. It was going to 
be this intellectual haven where it 
was okay to be smarr, okay to be 
fascinated by things and okay to be 
a dork. It was going to be the place 
where I could cultivate learnmg 

about things I loved . And in a lot of 
ways, I have been able to do that. I 
have learned how to anJIY'Le litera-
ture, to develop my though IS on 
paper and to discuss great works of 
writing. This isn't so much a criti-
cism of people who had mOlives for 
college that varied from mine. 
Rather, it is a statement of pity for 
people who ca nnOt see what a waste 
these years will be for them if they 
have a motivation other lhan the 
pursuit of knowledge.

NCAA: Fans 
shed tears 

overtoumey 
continued from iXtge 22 

they watch, no matter who their 
favori te team is playing. 

The other big reason for watch-
ing a sporting event is the likeli-
hood that either team could con-
ceivably win the contest. You could 
watch 1,000 games betwcen Preuss 
School aml the 1992 Bulls and 
nel'er see a Preuss tcam kno k off 
J ordan and company (or get a sin-
gle shot for that matter). But the 
pari ty in college ba ketball is 
deceivably good, especially at tour-
nament time. A. conference M VP 
can have an off night as easy as he 
ca n have a 30-point game. 
Fourteen-point favorites can, and 
have, fallen apa rt at the scams 
when introduced to a neutral site 
full of fans creaming thei r head 
off for the underdog. 

There is no feeling like the first 
two days of March Madness. You're 
confident that your carefully-
selected bracket will prove fruitfu l 
- this is the year. Bosses are hak-
ing their heads because half of their 
staff has called in sick to watch the 
game at home and the other half is 
wasting time refreshing th ei r 
browser to ca tch score updates as 
they "look busy" in their cubicles. 
By the end of the day, the blue and 
red paint adorning the face of an 
Arizona fan is smudged with tears 
because they choked yet again, my 
bracket i ripped into shreds cur -
ing the like of Holy Cross und 
Colorado for not pulling the upset 
the gods had promi ed me, and 
your obnoxlOus dead-head room-
mate IS winning your pool. 
Madness! 

And it doesn't go awayl Most of 
the games rurn out to be nail -biters 
up until the final buzzer sounds. 
The competirion is always III the 
air, and no one knows it better than 
Roy Williams and Jim Boe hei m. 
two coaches who have played up 
their tremendou luck, while trying 
to shake the nagging upsets that 
have stood in the way of their 
narional championships. Both have 
led their teams through the crazi-
ness multiple times, and have both 
made the trip to the finals only to 
see the I lall of Fame predictions of 
pundi ts, presidenrial phone call 
and trips to Disneyland go to the 
coach on the OIher bench. The 
Road to thc Final Four is erratic 
and adrenaline-fillcd , hm the Big 
Dance always ha a winner. Either 
Williams or Boeheim wtll learn 
what its like on 10nday night. 

The other will stammer off to 
the locker room cur>lI1g the "PJri -
ty" und "significancc" I speak so 
highly of. Il is dance Will be over 
for another year.

Volleyball: Tritons set goal for last week 
of season , hope to finish ahead of USC 

Nothing beats madness

continI/cd /rom page 24 
ment wa generated. Stanford 
pulled Out to a 15-4 ll.'3d early and 
put up an intimidating block that 
forced UCSD onto an abWldance of 
errors. The Cardi nal closed Out the 
game 30-20. 

The second game seemed to be 
a carbon copy of the first with 

tanford once again running out 
to a 15-4 lead 3nd finishing the 
game 30-20. 

The Triton had their best 
chance in the third game. since they 
kept the game close throughout. l 
25-25 however, the Cardinal were 
able to push three points on their 
serve and gal the cushion that was 
needed to win, 30-27. 

After the match, fourth-year 
UCSD head coach Ron Larsen 
praised Stanford for its strong play. 

"I thinl: they came in really 
focused and played outmnding, 
the first two game particularly. 
They got out and served better 
than they have all year. That's the 
best I've seen a tanford tcam play 
since I've been here," Larsen said . 

Despite the tough situation. 
the Tritons have a clear goal for 
this final week of their season. 

"'''e've gOt to come In ready for 
practice, and we've got to practice 
hard. We've got two matches 
agamst two teams that we could 
beat. If we win those matches, we'll 
be put ahead of [USC] and then 
that would do a lot of good for our 
program," Perrine said. 

The lntons' March 31 match 
against the La Verne was a sloppy 
match In which UCSD played 
down to Its inferior opponent, but 
pulled out the win 32-30, 30-20 
and 30-24. La Verne hIt -.012 for 
the malch, racking up more errors 
than kills and making the Tritons'

Others, like me, will be too busy 
collecting our jaws from the 
groWld. The Big Dance will finally 
be over and our pants will have been 
wetted with morc excitcment than a 
6-year-old who just rode the 
Goliath on a stomach full of pink

and college basketball in general, is 
the spon for sports fans. All of the 
great things about sports - the 
intensity of the games, the bi g shot 
hit by the benchwanner who's only 
in because of injuries \0 all five

the faces of fans and players of the 
analysts' favorite right after they 
lose. College basketball is the great-
est sport because it is the only real 
contest m which every team rtally 
has a sporting chance. 

College baskerball games, on the 
other hand, mean something. There 
arc around 30 games that each team 
plays. A loss IS always morc nc" ... tive 
than a win IS positive, seeing as how 
only 65 of the 306 Di"ision I teams 
make it to thc tournament. Games 
arc important no maner when they 
are pla}'eo. A win may make or break 
onc's chances to make it to the con-
ference tournament, which in tum 
affects their chances at making the 
national tournament. College fans

assists and 10rumer picked up 10

Verne in what one player 
de cribed as a "circus tent" with 
unreasonably warm temperarures. 

UCSD's final weekend of the 

sea on is April 12 and April 13 
against CSU Northridge and UC 
Santa Barbara. D espi te the 
Tritons' lack of success thus far, 
they remain optimistic. 

"Vle really have to go in with 
the mindser that we have nothing

There are two reasons why

FAQ on REEF's Financing 
Question: How are Education Investments different from a loan? 

Answer: Loans are sums of money lent at interest. Education Investments 
are sums of money disbursed to students at no interest. The 
obligation of an Education Investment is based on a fixed percentage 
of future income for a fixed period of time. This program allows 
flexibility in obligation according to your economic situation. 
Which means, you pay less when you have less and more when you 
have more. 

Question: Can these Education Investments pay for all of my tuition? 
Answer: Education Investments are a great complement for students that 

have already received grants, scholarships and federal loans, but 
still need more money for their living costs. REEF can help students 
fill the gap between what you have and what you need without the 
debt burden. REEF will pay upto $7000 to UCSD on your behalf. 

Question: How does this affect my Financial Aid package? 
Answer: Education Investments will not affect your Financial Aid package. 

REEF works closely with the Financial Aid Office and the Student 
Business Office at UCSD to ensure Education Investment 
disbursements fit into your cost of living package. As opposed to 
increasing the amount of loans you are responsible for, you know 
have an alternative way to finance your education that's more 
ensitive to your future ability to pay. 

Question: How are these percentage rates determined? Will they change 
throughout tbe life of the obligation? 

Answer: Percentage rates begin: 
0.1'1. for graduate students (1110 of one percent) 
0.2'1. for undergraduate students (l/5 of one percent) 

Rates are specific to each applicant. The more information a student 
gives REEF, the more accurately a rate is determined. Students are 
encouraged to inform REEF about their goals, career plans, intemships, 
major, test scores, CPA and anything else they think is relevant 
regarding their future.

MONDAY. APRIL' 7, 2003 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Polo: Tritons can't come back against UCD 
continued from page :24 

the boost it needed to establish a 
position of dominance in confer-
ence play. The Tritons struck 
first in the COntest, capitalizing 
on a 6-on-5 power play to take an 
early 1·0 lead. The goal swung 
the momentum U SD 's way, but 
on thc very next Davis pos es-
sion, the Aggles scored to tie the 
game at one and shut down any 
confidence the Tritons had . 

Still hurting from the blow, the 
Tritons gave up three more goal 
in the first quar'ter for a 4- 1 Davis 
lead . UCSD managed one more 
goal in the quarter, but offensive-
ly, the Tritons were having trouble 
with their passes and fumbling the 
ball a little too much. In any 
UCSD - UCD game, where the 
play is rough and the goals are 
ground Out with precision, allow-
ing four goals in a quarter is 
almost fatal. 

"After that first goal, we got a 
little too relaxed and we let up too 
much. It's frustrating to any team, 
and those goals really hurt us," 
Sanders said. 

The Triton defense toughened 
up in the second quarter, shutting 
down the Aggie offense and creat-
ing some opportunities on offense, 
but the Tritons continued to have 
their trouble in front of ti,e cage. 
UCSD scored in the third to pull 
within one at 4-3, and looked to 
take the equalizer, but two Davis 
goals shut down any signs of a 
Triton comeback. UCSD added 
one more in the fourth, but by 
then it was tOO Imle, too late. 

Bantilan· Smith was UC D's 
top corer with two goals. 

Tyler Huff/Wordian lik 
A missed chlnce: With Its loss to UC Davis, UCSD may have cost itself a top 
seed In the V'NIPA Championship from April 25 to April 27 in Bakersfield, Calif. 

UCSD goes into its next game 
against conference leader Loyola 
Marymount on April II knowing 
that the odds are agalllst them for 
a top seed, but the Tritons till 
plan to fini h strong. 

UTho e game could have 
given US the [seed], but -,ve squan-
dered those chances," Sanders 
said. K'vVe need to come together 
these next weeks and make up for 
our losses."

early on, easily taking all three dou-
·bles matche . The No. I team of 
junior Sameer Chopra and sopho-
more Bryan Swan sq uared o ff

freshman Tomas ovak and his 
partner, junior Jeff Wilson, faced 
Kyle Anderson and Ben Lundell

Meyer and Sean Nagel also beat 
Adam Morgan and Brett Morse-

With start 
of season 
come new· 
beginnings 

Tritons get a split of weekend games 

o Knows 
Owen Main 

T he beginning of April is a great ome of the year for portS fans. \,ve have the 
BA winding down, the CAA 

tournament heating up and for a 
day, fans of teams like the P~dre 

ca~ say, "\\'e're JU t a game back." 
The beginning of the baseball 

sea on IS filled with optimIsm and 
hope. For a while, I can hope that 
the Yankees go down, teams like 
the TWinS become dominant and 
that my favorite team can li l'e up LO 
my elevated expectations for once. 

\Ve can hope for things like 
what happened to the Angels last 
year; Pirates fans can say, "If the 
Angels did it, so can we!" 

For me, there is definItely a 
moment every year when I get 
goosebump at the sight of a major 
league game. Actually, thIS year It 
was In the pregame. That's the mo t 
fun part if you're a baseball fan, 
watclung teams warm up, take bat-
ong pracuce, marvel at how far they 
can hIt me hall and the way they can 
make long tm. 100).. routine. 

A.<. I 'tepped through the mnnel 
and laId ey~ on the field and its 
pregame g(~lng, on for the fir~t time, 
I clo.,ed my eye Jnd LOok a deep 
breath. I Inhaled a comblnJoon of 
the ll1ell of a hot dog and something 
burning. ,ood old QuaJcomm. 

I opened m)' eyes. A major league 
field IS Immaculate, In bener hape 
than a golf course and even mowed 
WIth the preCISion of a pumng green. 
There IS something totally different 
about being at a game In person as 
opposed to watching it on Tv, 
something I'll always be awed by. 

I went to take my seat In the 
nght field bleachers. It's a different 
vantage point to watch a game from, 
and you always have the chance of 
catchmg a home run ball. A fflend 
of mine got us four from row scats 
and for oncc, we dIdn't get ktcked 
out II hen the Padres usher came by 
and checked our ocketS. 

On the ~amc field , three days 
later, was anOther sIgn of hope m 
Dodgers pilcher Darren Drel fort . 
After ~Ignmg a huge cOntract a few 
year, ago, Drdon hadn't pItched 
smce 200 I after tearing the medial 
collateral ligament 111 hI right 

elb()\~ for the second ume. The 
begmnlllg of thIS season brought 
along wlm It the hope of a new 
bcgll1l11ng for 1m carcer. I Ie was the 
fourth starter m the rotauon and 
lost the game, but he dIdn't pitch 
badly. The pomt i that he pitched. 

BClI1g at a major league baseball 
game abo bnngs thoughts of my 
dad. Dodger StadIum took anore 
then three hours to dnve to from my 
hometown, and so going to a game 
With Just rum and my brother or the 
rest of my &milywa defirutely more 
then Just going to a game. 

It was a day where we'd leave at 
7 or 8 a.m. on a Sunday, get to the 
parktng lot gate at Chavez RaVlne 
and wai t for an hour for the gate to 
open . Once we gOt in ide, watclung 
the players come IntO the stadium 
and watchmg batting pracuce were 
some of the best ume we'd have.

UCSD takes down CSUB, can't 
come back against UC Davis 

By DANIEL DiAl 
Staff Writer 

In the race for top conference 
seeding, the women's water polo 
team roll ed into Bakersfield, 
Calif., on April 5 with an initia-
tive to beat CS Bakersfield and 
rival UC Davis, thereby ending a 
message to the rest of the 
\Ve tern \Vater Polo ssociation 
that the TritOns arc here to play. 

CSD showcased its team 
strength for even quarters, pick-
ing up a 10-5 victory over C UB 
in the process. Ilowever, it wa 
one leaky first period against 
Davi that brought the whole 
dream cras hing down. The 
Trito'ns fell to the ggies for the 
second time this sea on, 6-4 . 
\\'ith a 1-2 record against the 
Aggles for the eason and a 0-1 
record against conference leader 
Loyola Marymount, the prize of a 
top seed now look more distant 
than ever. 

"It is still possible to pick up a 
good seed for the [conference] 
tournament," said UC D head 
coach Larry anders. "But with 
two 10 es agaInst DaVIS, a team 
that we shOl~ld have beat, we Just 
made the road a whole lot 
tougher. II 

I f there were any II1dlcation of 
a weaknes~ 111 UCSD's dcfensi\e 

armor, it wasn't apparent in the 
opening game of the day against 
the Roadrunners. The Tritons 
held Bakersfield to only one goal 
in the first half, dominating the 
area in front of the cage. UCSD 
also controlled the tempo offen-
sively, but the goal-scoring well 
came up dry in the first half. The 
halftime score of 2- 1 only con-
firmed the Story of a team that 
was outplaying its opponent, but 
failing to get the total advantage. 

"We definitely outplayed 
Baker field , and we were looking 
for that opportunity to ju t take 
that game away; but without goal, 
it just wa n't happelling," anders 
said. 

The Triton offense finally 
broke out of its shell in the sec-
ond half, torchIng the 
Roadrunner defense for five sore-
ly needed goals, givi ng UCSD a 
commanding 7- 1 lead before 
bringing out the ubs in the 
fourth quarter. U SD' bench 
also gOt into the act , addi ng three 
goal of their own while plckll1g

The Roadrunner hit three

off the contest. Meri s Bantilan-
