Staff Writer 

It's a bright and sunny day at the 
beach as a middle-aged couple 
lounge and reflect on their lives. 
Suddenly their nonnalcy is m. 
terrupted by, yes, two life-sized 
lizards who carry on just like 
humans. 

A little bizarre? Naturally, it's 
an Edward Albee play. And 
naturally, Seascape reflects 
Albee's propensity for the absurd. 
It's aU very well handled by 
director Jack Tygett-right down to 
the fascinating rhythmic head 
jerks and movement patterns of 
the two lizards. 

The Old Glove production has 
just the right chemistry as the 
entire structure fuses nicely 
together. The ordinary reality of 
the distant waves, an occasional 
jet flying overhead (the wee-done 
sound by Phil Shofner,) the bright 
sand dunes and lovely blue sky 
(Robert Zentis did a fabulous job,) 
the lively bantering between the 
two humans, then bam-the lizards 
and a new reality to deal with. 

What does it all mean? Well, 
there's the intellectual level-
man's fate, existentialism, etc. 
But it's tempting just to enjoy it on 
an entertainment level and laugh 
at the incongruity of it all. Albee's 
gift for verbal pyrotechnics, 
cOlnbined with interesting 
characters, setting and a crazy 
situation are wonderful. Some 
critics call his form a kind of 
dialectic, "an oscillation between 
the prosaic and the absurd, obvious 
and mysterious, commonplace and 
revelation." 

Any way you look at it, Seascape 
is a kind of off-the-wall treat. The 
play opens with average, everyday 
Charlie and Nancy catching some 
rays in some sand dunes. Nancy is 
the more active of the two, put-
tering around with her painting, 
shouting at the lethargic Charlie to 
be young and energetic. 

Charlie, on the other hand, is 
sacked out on a beach blanket, 
relaxed and mellow, pointing out 
that he's earned his retirement. "I 

. just want to do nothing," he says 
lazily. But Nancy won't have it. 
"Is that what we've come all this 
way for?" 

She suggests that they "move 
from ne hot sand strip to another-
see places, do things." ButCharlie

won't budge. He's not up to trying 
out a new life-it's too scary. "I'm 
not up to the glaciers and the 
crags." 

It's at this stagnant part of their 
lives that the lizards appear. 
Ironically, the lizards are trying 
this very idea out. Well, not 
exactly glaciers and crags, but life 
on the hot sand strip. When a 
mutual amity is tentatively 
established between two couples, 
the lizards, Sarah and Leslie, tell 
about how they are seeking a new 
life out of the water. 

And they are amazed at their 
new world. In fact, it is their 

fascination for ordinary things that 
is the source of a lot of the laughs in 
the second act. Simple things like 
clothes, shaking hands (or legs, as 
they call it,) airplanes and juman' 
reproduction are curious wonders 
to them. 

One big question that one ke€ps 
in mind after the lizards pop in: 
how the hell is Albee going to end 
the play now that he's thrown a 
monkeywrench into everything? 
Well. he more or less cops out and 
the play is literally dimmed out 
through melodramatic lighting 
technique (Steph Storer.) A 
disappointing conclusion, yet keep 
in mind this is an Albee play-and 
unconventional, often discon-
certing flourishes are not un-
common. Sometimes it works, 
sometimes it doesn't. It didn't 
work here. 

But the faultiness of the play IS 
nicely compensated by.the craft of 

the cast. Throughout the first act, 
the playful and often amusing 
bickering may have dragged 
slightly where not handled 
properly . However, Valerie 
Snyder and Ron Ray guide the play 
smoothly and with style. 

Snyder, an Englishwoman 
making her first debut at the 
Globe, is perfect as the petulant 
Nancy. Her channing English 
enunciations add something 
special to her lines. And Ray 
proves what a skilled veteran he is, 
acting his role as the quietly suf-
fering Charlie. 

As for the ~'.re just 

-

great. Susan M. Rihr and Doug 
Hinkston move convincingly in 
their stunning lizard garb (Li&~ 
Skiles' costumes prove to be highly 
innovative and imaginative.) They 
slither from one point to another 
with captivating poses, their heads 
moving mechanically and con-
sistently, regarding the humans 
with fascination and caution. 

A nice thing about the play is that 
it's rarely boring-and if towards 
the end one hasn't gotten anything 
out of it all (which is doubtful )-the 
lizards make it worthwhile. 
There's a little bit of something for 
everybody in Seascape-it's a well-
put-together crazy idea. 

Seascape is being performed at 
the Old Globe Theatre in Balboa 
Park. Full time college students
