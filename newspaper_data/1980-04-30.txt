Rescue Failure Frustrates Carter 
Says Iranians Are 'Ghoulish' in Nationally Televised Press Conference 

WASHINGTON (AP) -
President Carter, clearly frustrated , 
lashed outlast night at the "ghoulish" 
display of American dead in Tehran 
and defended his ill-fated attempt to 
r'escue the hostages as an effort worth 
taking_ 

Carter said it would have been a 
worse failure not to have attempted 
the rescue , saying e fforts at 
diplomacy had met with failure in an 
Iran split by competing political 
interests. 

In a news conference, Carter 
described his m eling Sunday with 
members of the commando team and 
said they expressed "deep regret that 
they failed to carry out the mission as 
planned" and asked "to be permitted 

Chancellor William McElroy 

to try again." 
He expressed anger with "the 

ghoulish actions of the terrorists and 
some of the government officials in 
Iran ... who displayed in a horrible 
exhibition of inhumanity the bodies of 
our courageous Americans ." 

"This has aroused the disgust and 
contempt of the rest of the world and 
indicates quite clearly the kinds of 
people with whom we have been 
dealing in a peaceful effort to secure 
the resolution of this crisis." 

He added: "We cannot deal with 
inhumane people who have no 
respect for international law," yet 
vowed to keep taking peaceful means 
to win freedom for the 53 Americans 
held for nearly six months. 

Mea n w hi .1 e, the Ce n tra I 
Intelligence Agency believes that 60 
percent of the American hostages in 
Iran would ha ve been killed or 
wounded if President Carter's rescue 
plan was carried out as planned , 
KCSS Radio in San Francisco 
reported . 

The a11·news station, quoting a 
source it said has been "accurate in 
every detail so far, " said Monday 
there was a CIA report saying "60 
percent of the American captives 
were likely to be killed or wounded 
even if the assault had gone off as 
planned." 

A CIA spokesman in Washington 
who was not identified declined 
comment on the story. 

The station quoted the source as 
saying the plan was approved even 
though the Joint Chiefs of Staff 
reportedly were given the CIA 
document. 

The CIA believed that it would be 
impossible to free all the hostages at 
the same time because they were in 
small groups in different areas of the 
embassy compound, KCSS said it 
was told by the source. 

"At the time the mission was 
terminated, we did it with great 
regret ," Carter said last night. 

In an opening statement, Carter 
said, "a failure to attempt a worthy 
effort, a failure to try" would have 
been worse than the failure of the

Let's Work·, Give Money to Help 
Defeat 9, ~ Says With Gift Funds 

BY REBECCA LOWEN 
Staff Writer 

Chan ellor William McElroy, 
using funds donated to the 
univer ity , sent a letter to campus 
staff last weei< warning them of 
potential salary cuts if Proposition 
9 is passed June 3. 

" I am afraid that citizens'

They would have us believe that

said. 

"What Jarvis do sn't say is that

isn't that great. For exam pi , the 
net tax saving for the av ra~

amount to only about $ 125 over 
one year. That' not mu h of a

making th distinction between 
writing the letter as a private

(David Saxon, UC President, 
drew fire for using univer ity funds 
to send a letter to over 100.000 
UC students warning them that if 
Proposition 9 passes, tuition would 
be imposed for th first time in the

BY CAROLYN FRIDAY

California set another 

precedent this week when the 
California Post -secondary 
Education Commission 
(CPEC) announced it was 
compiling a registry of women 
and ethnic minorities who 
would qualify for academic 
and admini trative positions at 
the state's publi colleges a nd

Although approximately 70

California is the fir t state to 
establish an affirmative action 
list of admini trator and 
f"c ulty candidates from a ro s

member said. 

Any woman or ethnic 
minority wishing to be 
included in the regiltry merely 
lubmit. free of charge a 
registration form obtained 

from CPEC in Sacramento. 
CPEC will then-forward these 
names on a computer tape to 
the systemwide affirmative 
action offices at UC, csue 
and the state college , who in 
turn, should make the names 
avai lable to the various 
campuses. 

The compilation of this 
registry was mandated by the 
1977 Hugh s Bill (AB 105), 
a legislative attempt to r ctify 
the under .representation of 
ethnic minorities and women

claimed, in the upper

base for its Middle Eastern security 
anchor. Of course, Sadat seems very 
confident. But so did the Shah almost 
till the moment of his departure from 
Iran. As with the former Iranian 
regime, Sadat's men make no secret of 
their lavish taste. . Opulence has 
returned to Egypt. Rich men are again 
in prominence all the while the grinding 
proverty of Cairo is everywhere 
apparent. The Iranian Revolution had 
a slowly growing grounds well that 
finally toppled the tyranny. Who can 
say with high probability that Anwar 
Sadat sits more secure in his 
presidential palace than the Shah did? 

There is resentment aplenty in 
Egypt, enough to suggest that the US 
might radically consider once and for 
all consigning to the trash bin of history 
the geopolitical strain of thinking which 
gave rise to the Nixon Doctrine. 

In short , that thinking held that we 
are involved in a deadly chess game 
with the Russians. We have big allies 
and big enemies. The small countries 
are only pawns in the game, to be 
shoved about, blocked or captured as 
needed. 

But with the Russians bogged down 
in Afghanistan and the US facing 
social upheaval in Central America , 
the geopolitical chess game looks very 
fuzzy . Crystal clear, on the other hand, 
is the fact that in too many countries 
popular social upheavals are becoming 
the chief threat to entrenched regimes. 
And short of nukein g whole 

populations, there is no mmtary way 
whatsoever of manipulating these 
situations. Nor are the old 
methodologies of the CIA or Moscow 
- or Peking·oriented communist 
parties fomenting these upheavals . 

TIle stark fact is that people allover the 
world are made, furious, contemptuous 
of their governments. 

The growing wave of refugees from 
Cuba is sending a warning signal to 
Castro that thanks to his regime's 
foreign adventurism and disastrous 
mismanagement of the economy, even 
he might risk the fate of other 
overthrown autocrats. So too with 
"Baby" Doc's Haiti, where - as in 
Egypt - wealth preens itself 
prominently against a backdrop of the 
worst poverty in the Western 
Hemisphere. The scenario is repeated 
all over Central America. 

In response to similar tensions, Iran 
underwent a revolution that well· 
known Harvard scholar of Iran, Prof. 
Richard Frye, said is to the Islamic 
world what the French Revolution was 
to the western. Despite the chaotic 
early years of the French Revolution, 
France in the end emerged as a 
powerful and unified country. A new 
social basis for government had been 
laid , and power that rests solidly in and 
not upon the people is the only lasting 
basis of stable governance. There is no 
substitute for democracy, even if it is as 
messy as it now is in Iran.

US, Iranian Fighters 
Clash Over Oman 

TEHRAN - Two carrier. 
based US' fighter jets 
intercepted an Iranian patrol 
plane over the vital Gulf of 
Oman and "escorted" it back 
to Iranian air space yesterday, 
the Pentagon said. Iran 
claimed the American jets 
"started to shoot" at the plane; 
the Pentagon said no weapons 
were fired. 

The aerial encounter was 
the first military confrontation 
between the United States and 
Iran since militants occupied 
the US Embassy in Tehran 
and took 53 Americans 
hostage Nov. 4. 

Meanwhile, a Swiss 
representative in Tehran was 
quoted as saying the bodies of 
eight Americans killed in last 
Friday 's aborted hostage 
rescue effort will be flown to 
Zurich this week. And Iranian 
President Abolhassan Bani· 
Sadr called for a special 
meeting of non·aligned 
countries to deal with the US 
action in launching such a 
mission , the official Iranian 
news agency said. 

President Carter said 
yesterday he believes he 
"made the right choice" in 
ordering the hostage rescue 
attempt. 

During a visit to Kuwait, the 
Iranian foreign minister, 
Sadegh Ghotbzadeh, escaped 
injury when gunmen in two 
cars fired at his motorcade. 
Iran blamed the incident on 
neighboring Iraq. 

Iran's revolutionary ruler, 
Ayatollah Ruhollah Kho· 
meini , claimed " American 
pseudo·left groups" and 
agents of the deposed Shah 
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, 
carried out a wave of 
bombings in Tehran on 
Monday, according to Tehran 
radio. The Iranian news 
agency Pars sai d four 
Germans who arrived in Iran 
on April 15 claiming to be 
correspondents for the 
magazine Stern were being 
held in connection with the 
bombings. A bombing was 
reported yesterday near 
Ahvaz , 350 miles southwest 
of Tehran. 

The Iranian news agency 
Bani ·Sadr yesterday as saying 
he had asked Cuban President 
Fidel Castro, current head of 
the non.aligned nations, to 
convene a special meeting to 
deal with the America n 
hostage rescue attempt.

Alfred Hitchcock 
Dead at 80 

HOLLYWOOD - Sir 
Alfred Hitchcock, the Master 
of Suspense whose movies at 
once charmed and terrified 
audiences for more than 50 
years, died yesterday at his 
home of natural causes, 
spokesmen for the 80·year·old 
director said. 

His bland manner , egg 
shape face with lower·lip pout , 
his instant wit and affection for 
good living made him one of 
Hollywood 's most identifiable 
and best loved personalities. 
But his professional stature 
stemmed from his exceptional 
craftsmanship in putting 
together dramatic thrillers of 
infinite variety. 

PG&E Gets 
Rate Hike 

SAN FRANCISCO - A 
whopping $1.2 billion annual 
gas and electric rate increase 
- the largest ever granted in 
California - was authorized 
for Pacific Gas and Electric 

Co. yesterday to offset highe.r 
fuel costs. 

The increases , granted by 
the Califomia Public Utilities 
Commission, go into effect 
immediately. The PUC 
stressed the massive increases 
will have no affect on PG&E's 
profits. 

Under the new rate hikes, 
the average homeowner will 
pay an additional $7.24 a 
month for energy used during 
the summer and some $14.40 
more during the winter.

HELENA, Montana -
Claiming nuclear war would 
erupt within hours yesterday, 
the leader of a religious sect 
said members of his faith had 
taken refuge in fallout shelters 
in several Western states. 

However, police in most 
cities he named as refuge 
areas said they had no reports 
of people heading for shelters, 
private or public. 

Leland Jensen, 65 , a 
chiropractor and "naturo· 
pa thic physician" in Missoula, 
predicted that either a nuclear 

war would start or "an 
accident that will cause it to 
happen" would occur at 7:55 
pm EDT yesterday. 

Jensen said he believes all 
a lies with populations of 
100,000 or more and major 
military bases are targeted for 
nuclear attack from the Soviet 
Union. 

He said he bued his 
prediction on biblical prophecy

Lions Pick Sims Number 1 in NFL Draft 
BYV's Marc Wilson to Oakland, USC's Charles White on his way to Cleveland 

NEW YORK (AP) -
"Whatever the pros dish out, 
I'm ready to take," halfback 
Billy Sims said yesterday alter 
Detroit made him the No. I 
pick in the National Football 
League college dralt. 

Taking what the pros dish 
out, though , is contingent 
upon what the Lions dish out 
monetarily - and right now 
the former Oklahoma star and 
his prospective employers are 
lar apart on a contract. 
. "Detroit will have to wake 
up," the 24.year-old Sims said 
01 the Lions' undisclosed offer 
which is apparently lar below 
the $4.5 million, six-year 
contract he and his agent, 
Jerry Argovitz, are seeking. 

"I hope to be able to sign 
with Detroit soon" , said Sims, 

a 5 · loot · II , 2 10-pound 
speedstar . "Everybody's 
making a 100 percent effort 
except Lions ' genera l 
manager Russ Thomas. He's 
made a zero effort." 

"Our hope is we'll soon 
resolve it, " Thomas said lrom 
Detroit. "But I can't stand here 
and tell you we' I sign him next 
week . He deserves the best 
contract he can get and it's his 
agent's job to get him that 
contract. I understand that 
and we're working on it but it's 
going slowly." 

Once the Lions picked 
Sims, a Heisma n Trophy 
winner as a junior, and the 
runner -up in the balloting to 
Southern Cal' s Charles White 
as a senior, the door was open 
to a draft choice·trade between

the San Francisco 4gers, No.2 
on the list, and the New York 
Jets, with the 13th and 20th 
picks in the opening round. 

1/ Detroit hadn't taken Sims, 
the 4gers would have. Instead, 
they used New York's two 
selections to take Earl Cooper, 
a lullback from Rice, and Jim 
Stuckey, a defensive end from 
Clemson. And the Jets , 
already possessing one of the 
most feared deep threats in 
Wesley Walker, used the 
4gers' pick to grab another 
burner , Johnny " Lam" Jones 
01 Texas. 

" If we have two guys going 
Uke Walker and Jones, it will 
put tremendous pressure on 
the opposing defense," said

Derrick Gainey . it gives New 
York the potential of an 
explosive three wide receiver· 
offense or of sending Jones out 
of the backfield from the 
halfback slot. 

Cooper, too , offers 
versatility . San Francisco 
coach Bill Walsh said he is a 
back "with excellent size 6 -2, 
227 who is also nimble. He 
should fit into our runnin~ 
game and our passing game. ' 

If the 49ers hadn't been able 
to swing their deal with the 
Jets , insiders Ii gured they'd 
have gone lor Brigham Young 
quarterback Marc Wilson. 
Instead, the 6·4, 204.pounder 
wound up across the Bay with 
Oakland . His selection, No. 16 
overall. raised a few eyebrows 

considering the Raiders' recent 
quarterba c k swap with 
Houston when they shipped 
Ken Stabler to the Oilers in 
exchange for Dan Pastorini. 

" I was beginning to wonder 
if I'd ever be chosen," said 
Wilson. "I though I'd go 
higher. There was 10 much 
talk that it got to the point 
where I was just happy to be 
picked at all." 

Oakland coach Tom Flores 
explained: "We had no idea he 
would be there. We were 
looking for a running back but 
when you have a chance for a 
quarterback like this one you 
can't pass him up." 

Wilson was one of the two 
lirst round quarterbacks 
selected .

Baseball Rivals Finally Fall After 12 Years 
BY TIM LIOTTA 

Sports £,lilor 

There hasn't been a bigger 
upset since David slew Goliath 
in biblical times. 

The UCSD' men's baseball 
team upended the NCAA 
Division I power, USD, 
clipping the Toreros' in the 
heel, 6-5 on Olsen Field last 
Thursday. It was the first time 
thE' Tritons had defeated their 

Senior Tom Nicholson, in 
his final outing as a Triton, 
then went to work stifling the 
Toreros, allowing only one hit 
in the first ~ve innings he 
pitched. 

UCSD added to their lead , 
with one run in the third inning 
and two more in the fifth. The 
filth inning rally saw five 

t NFL !?ra/t: See p. 5 -----------~--
L . ~s town rivals in 12 years of 
play. The dismal past record 
against the Torero!, who had 
captured the 1977 NCAA 
Division II championship, had 
seen UCSD come close but 
never win one. 

consecutive Triton batters 
co llect a basehit. 

But USD wouldn't roll over , 
as their power-packed lineup 
finally dented the stubbom 
Triton defense for two runs in 
the top of the sixth. Once the 
vault was opened, the Toreros 
went back to the bank for runs 
in each of the next three 
innings, tying the score in the 
top half of the ninth at 5-5. 

Good Weather Brings Out 
Best in Men's Track Team 

The Tritons had already 
been bombed earlier this 
season by the Toreros twice, 
during two visits to US D's 
"Va lley of the Giants" 
stadium. But on Thursday, it 
was a different story. 

UCSD jumped on the 
scoreboard first on back -to-
back doubles by Tony Hicklin 
and Pat McGovern in the 
bottom of the first inning, for a 
2-0 lead. 

The Triton half of the ninth 
inning proved to be the 
difference as steady Dean 
Scarafoni led off with a double. 
Pat McGovern walked, both 
runners advancing on Tony 
Hickllmd's grounder. 

Despite a stormy winter which rained out 
several early season meets, the UCSD track 
team has responded to the recent good 
weather (before this week) with some 
performances worthy of national competition. 

The men's team haH won one dual meet so 
far this season, a February 9 meeting over 
Claremont College. Immediately after this 
victory, rain washed out three meets last 
quarter. The constant downpour had a 
demoralizing effect on the members of the 
team. 

Despite the early season problems , the 
team hung together and trained hard. The 
Tritons were ready for the weather to turn and 
when it did they gave some excellent 
performances. 

Decathlete John Serrano has been one of 
track coach Andy kief's top performers. He 
qualified for national competi tion in the NAIA 
National Championships, to be held at 
Abilene Christian University later thi quarter.

Serrano has given the impression that he's a 
superman of sorts. 

In his latest decathalon competition, he was 
hit in the shoulder blade by a javelin, errantly 
thrown out of the sector. After being rushed to 
the emergency room of a nearby hospital for 
some minor repair work, he returned to 
complete the event. He scored 6,824 points, 
qualifying for the national competition. 

Local Surfers Compete 

Two of UCSD's four high jumpers have 
cleared the 6'8" qualifying height for national 
entry. Chris Sando, who recently won the 
event after clearing the prescribed height in 
the Cal Tech Invitational, and Larry Flynn , 
have both earned a trip to the nationals . 

The track season winds down with the last 
meet of the season this Saturday when UCSD 
hosts US International University and the Los 
Angeles Police Department on Warren Field 
for a 1 pm start. 

Coach Skief and 'his team members have 
begun to set their sigh ts on nE'"t season.

The Old Globe Thea tre's 
long.awaited production of 
The BiflO Inques t is currently 
playing a t the Carter Center 
Stage Theater in Balboa Park. 
After its initial commission by 
th e Royal Shakespeare 
Company in London, the play 
was presented in New York , 
San Francisco, and most 
recently at the Mark Taper 
Forum in Los Angeles, 
receiving mixed rt'views and 
general popularity. 

The script was culled from 
transcripts of the inquest into 
the circumstan es surrounding 
the death of Steven Biko, a 
proponent of Black Con-
sciousness in South Africa. 
The text, which was smuggled 
out of South Africa after the 
trial, is itself an interesting and 
important document but also, 
being a trial transcript, lends 
itself marvelously to the 
dramatic idiom, as it pursues 
the notion that a trial is really 
an elaborate ritual or drama. 

Unfortunately, the Old 

Health is not a 
static slate of being. 
Health is a state of 

progressiv~ change. 

Globe production allows itself 
to negate practically all the 
dramatic po sibilities of The 
Bilw Inquest , not giving the 
playa fair trial , as it were. All 
the players in this show carne 
to the production with a self· 
righteousness which belies the 
reality of the characters' 
positions in the drama. 

The Daily- Guardian 

Arts 
The most clear example of 

this tendency is Von Schauer, 
who plays the barrister for the 
Biko family. He appears 
incapable of approaching the 
tria l from the point of view of 
his character , that is, as if the 
trial was not already a closed 
affair. This results in a kind of 
static characterization , where 
there is no movement in his 
mood : he is simply outraged 
throughout, instead of

Photographu/C~ris Sherman 

'Solana Backward' Pictures Neighborhood 
Photographers with an 

interest in realism have often 
turned their cameras on their 
own environments - their 
famaies or neighborhoods. 
The mythos of the Camera as 
the Revealing Eye has a strong 
tradition in the "art world", 
from the tenement portraits of 
Jocab Rijs to the so-called 
"social anatomy" portraits of 
August Sander, to the more 
modern plunges into popular 
photojournalism of Bill 
Owenl' Suburbia and Robert 
Frank's Americans. 

Liz Siaco, a Visual Arts 
Graduate studen t , has 
photographed a very small 
microcOimic neighborhood in 
Solana Beach. It i. very easy 
to drive right by the small 
community at 225 South 
Highway 101 and not even 
realize it exists. Silco' s 
photograph. are intimate and 
revealing, obviously the kind 
of work which could only have 
been produced by a resident af 

the neighborhood. 
Her technique is rough, but 

with an elegant·intimate sort 01 
whimsy to each portrait which 
serves as a cement lor each 
individual image, bringing the 
whole show together as a 
coherent and very powerful 
.tatement 01 the material 
objecta and the relationships 
between residents which 
characterize true neighbor-
hoods . 

Sisco's photographic point 
of view participates with her 
neighbora but also transcends . 
One of the more interesting 
aspects of the show are the 
various obscure and non-
traditional vantage points she 
takes as a photographer, 
giving each image a look 
which is true hybrid between 
the lamily snapshot and the 
planned, carefully executed 
art image. This lends the effect 
of a varied, amalgamated 
mosaic . Ana/o. ~II. Solana Backwards, featuring "neighborhood" photos, will be at the Mandeville Annex Gallery through May 2. Hour. are 12 pm to 5 pm, Monday through Friday.

Von Schauer is not alone in 
this. None 01 the players seem 
to be capable of leaving the 
issue in a ny doubt, so what we 
get is a cheap propaganda

The exception , however , is 
UCSD studenl Navarre Perry,

Perry brilliantly characterizes 
the rabbit-like Dr. Hersh, 
bringing into this farce an 
element of uncertainty, while 
everyone else has forgotten 
that these men are men, no 
mailer how evil. They are 
depicted as monsters.

proceeding to conform with 

~Iish judicial procedure; this 
trial looks as if it took plac 
in San Diego, rather than in 
Johannesburg. I h,s lack 01 art 
might be defended by some 
conceptual foolery, but to m , 
looks like 'heer laLiness. 

There lone excellent 
innovation introduced by 
Higgins. CUlling th trial into 
short scene, he injects 
excerpts of Biko' writings and 
speeches into th ac tion. J . 
Aubrey Island , as Biko, 
speaks of revolution, of 
religion , of sport and culture, 
stating unequivocally the 
Afri ca n altitude toward 
relations with Whites. In ma ny 
cases these tirades have direc t 
relation to the pre ding 
scene, and always offer 
tangential relation to the play, 
adding a haunting dimension 
to the trial. a sort of evocation 
of the dead man in question.

aspects of this innovation are 
handl ed c rudel y, u ing

effect is of Steven Biko a t

he surely deplored. I land' 
charac terization belies what

a b lIicose jingoist rather than

surely was. 

All the crilrcisms could 
well point to the v ry eff c ts 
Higgins and the cas t hoped to 
achi ve, the imm diacy and 
universality of the tr ial's

urgency of Biko's position.

Sims # 1 in NFL Draft 
Continued (rom page 5 

The other was Arizona 
tat 's Mark Ma lone, chos n 

by the Pittsburgh teelers as 
the heir-appa r nt to Terry 
Bradshaw who has said h will 
probably retire in two years. 

" ) fe I that I am wi thout a 
doubt the best athlete to play 
quarterba k in a long, long 
time," Malon said. "That's 
what the pro couts tell me and 
I b lieve them .. .1 have what it 
takes t o h a gr at 
quarterback in the NFL." 

Mom e nt b efore the 
te I rs closed the 2-hour, 51 -

minute fir s t round, the 
Cleveland Browns selected the 
round's fifth running back, 
Southern Cal's Charles White , 
whose size 5-10, 184 and lack 
of speed are being held against 
him but whose durability is 
unquestionable. 

Not only did the Lions and 
4gers pass him up for other 
running ba ks , so did the 
Baltimore Colts, who took 
Curtis Dickey of Texas A&M, 
and the New England Patriots , 
who selected Notre Dame's 
Vagas Ferguson . 

fh only position to attract 

more attention than running 
back in the fir t round was 
defen ive back. Six of them-
cornerbacks and safeties -
were s I cted , starting with 
Colorado's Mark Haynes by 
the New York Giants . 

But the bigg t attention-
getter clearly was Sims. he 
f1 a hed a winning smile, a 
victory sign and a football to a 
balcony of cheering spectators 
when h emerged from th 
shadows the moment NFL 
Commissioner Pete Rozelle 
ca ll ed out his nam at the draft 
headquarter , a midtown New 
York hotel. 

" D e troit is a grea t 
challenge," Sims said a few 
minutes later a t a news 
conference. 

"They have uniform No.20 
ready and I'm ready to fill their 
shoes. With the people they 
haye, we can make a great 
program." 

And in Detroit , coac h 
Monte Clark added: "He's the 
best football player in the 
country this year. That 's why 
we pi ked him. He is a quality 
person . I'm v ry impre d 
with him ." 

T he differen , according to 
Coffey, is that UC counted a 
executive level administra tors 
everyone from student body 
president to linen servi e 
people, with salaries ranging 
from $7,500 and up. 

The state colleges, on the 
other hand, reported only 
those who mad a1aries of 
more than $25 ,0 00.

said, "is a sentiment shared 
with the men who went on this

men" who had tried were 
prepared to tr again. 

Carter vowed: " We will not 
forg tour hostag s. We will 
take whatever s teps ar

Carter's news conference

Sen. Edmund Muskie to

secretary of tate. Vance 
resigned Mon day in a n 
unusual public clash with 
Carter over the wisdom of last 
week 's rescue mi sion . 

Explaining Vance's 
position , Carter said Vance 
was against any milita ry 
action and preferred "that w 
not ta ke a ny kind of action in 
Iran that might hav had any 
connotations of a milita ry 
nature . His preference was to 
wait lon ger instead of
