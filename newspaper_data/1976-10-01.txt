Eliot Richardson in San Diego 
• There Are Limits To What Amer,ica Can. Accomplish 

by Vera M.I. Todorov 
Community Editor 

Secretary of Commerce Eliot 
Richardson, in an interview with 
collegiate newspaper represen-
tatives at the Westgate Hotel 
Tuesday night, explained that the 
public's "erosion of confidence in 
government" is due to "over-
promising" on the part of 
politicians. 

Richardson said the public must 
overcome a "don't just stand 
there; do something instinct" 
when dealing with a national 
problem. He outlined the "limits of 
what we can expect and what 
resources can accomplish," citing 
an example from his experiences 
in Great Britain as Ambassador to 
that COWltry . 

GovermneDt Owr-Commltment 
He said that Great Britain is a 

perfect example of a government 
that is "totally over-committed 
and totally over-involved" in 
private enterprise. Richardson 
said that labor in Great Britain, 
Wlder the Socialist Party, wanted 
an increase in wages of 30 to 35 
percent and a decrease in the 

Accreditation 

traditional eight hour work day. 
Government response to labor's 

demands, Richardson said, 
created a rate of inflation that was 
higher than the wage increase, 
causing the English pound to drop 
to its lowest value in history. 

Rkhardson said, "to escape this I 
trap, you must create in-
centive .... get the government out 
of private industry. We 
(Americans) are in a situation 
where we can profit from Great 
Britain's experience."

should be reevaluated." 

Richardson said there is erosion 
in the loan program, just as in 
people's confidence in govern-
ment. "There is a propensity to 
cheat, not an obligation and 
responsibility to repay. Other 
people aren't real ... just faces. The I 
students are just thinking of I...

Richardson also explained that 

jobs for liberal arts majors will not 
be stimulated by the government, 
because of a federal necessity for 

smau science-based factories. 
Richardson said, "I believe a 
liberal arts education is the best 
education an individual can 
receive, but liberal arts majors 
will have to learn that their college 
education will not necessarily yield 
them a job." 

SBPC Urges Student 
-Control Over Fee Hike

of guidelines and present them to 
everyone at once. 

What Does it Mean 'for ' UCSD? 

An irresistible force met an 
immovable object last week as the 
Student Body President Council 
(SBPC) again presented UC 
President Saxon a list of recom-
me da~o,ns .lor ,guidelines on. ~~ 
upcoming registration fee n-
crease. 

Meeting in Los Angeles, the 
SBPC reiterated that " assuring 
meaningful student input in setting 
the differential levels" was their 
most important concern. The 
differential increase levels are to 
be detennlned by each campus 
chancellor in accordance witt 
guidelines established by Saxon. 
The SBPC wants to insure student 
control over the increase, which 
may be as much as $24 next year 
and another $21 increase the year 
after. 

The SBPC feels as though it is 
being left out of the guideline 
process. Saxon asked the SBPC for 
input on the guidelines first, but he 
has since not communicated with 
the Council about what shape the 
guidelines would take.

News Editor 

So now that UCSD has received a 
100year accreditation, what does it 
mean? 

The late June decision, the result 
of last spring's accreditation study 
by a 12 member team from the 
Western Association of Schools and 
Colleges, has met with varied 
reaction from students, staff and 
administration. 

" Basically, the accreditation we 
received was a re-affinnation of 
the soundness of our total 
program," said Wayne Gray of_ 
academic planning. "Though 
accreditation is very rarely not 
given, the report on UCSD was 
particularly complimentary." 

The report, as Vice-chancellor of 
Academic Affairs Paul Saltman 
noted, "could hardly have b..."en 
better if we had paid for it. It was 

Paul D . Soltman 

complimentary al.r!tost to the point 
of being public relations. We were 
delighted and enthused with their 
findings, and it confinns what 
we've been saying about this place 
for a long time: it's pretty damned 
good." 

The "probationary" three year 
accreditation UCSD had been 
working under was a result of the 
critical 1973 accrediting report 
which cited 44 major concerns at 
the time. Better preparation for 
the 1976 team, including a stack of 
reading material over four inches 
high and composed of more than 
500 pages of text and tables 
relating to UCSD, a detailed 130 
page self-study report and superior 
organizing resulted in what was 
tenned by all quarters "a very 
fruitful visit. " . 

" Don't think that the 1976 
conunittee members came to pat 
us on the back," said Saltman. 
"They arrived jaundiced-eyed and 
hard-nosed, ready to be critical of 
us. Our . programs have improved 
in the last · three years, as 
evidenced by the report, but it 
should be noted that problems with 
the 1973 accrediting team, in-
cluding notably communication, 
organizatioo, qualified persoMel 
on that committee and other such 
circumstances resulted in their 
negative report. II' 

nus year's accrediting report, 
whUe questioning some depart-
menta and facets of the total UCSD 
educational process, still managed 
to paint a picture of quaUty ~ 
dergraduate and graduate 
education. Some students question 
thia analysiJ, and many feel that 
the inadequadea pointed out in last 
May'. antl ... ccredttaUon rally still 
need to be reckoned with. Concerns

sexual discrimination. 

Though some members of the 
accrediting team met with 
students late last April, the 
gathering had questionable im-
pact. "I believe that they didn't 
give a damn about what the 
students felt," said Bert Lee, who 

Bert Lee 
now represents Revelle College on 
the Advisory Committee on 
Student Fee Programs. "It seemed 
to me that at the meeting they were 
only giving toten .attention to the 
students. Admittedly, part of the 
fault can be attributed to the 
studera, as they didn't really have 
the hard data to give. H students 
get more involved, and It appears

('ontillul'(l "" Pug 8 

In a letter to Saxon the SBPC 
listed three main recom-
mendations they felt should be 
included in the reg fee guidelines to 
insure "minimum levels of student 
participation on the" reg fee in-
creases. The recommendations 
were : I 

" 1: Any proposal by the Chan-
cellor for a differential 
registration fee . increase shall be 
submitted to the registration fee 
committee prior to its trans-
mission to the President. The 
proposal must be ' approved by a 
majority of the committee 's 
student members. 

2: Any major capital ex-
penditures funded by the 
registration fee shall be approved 
by a majority of students voting in 
a campus-wide referendum held 
during the regular academic year. 
The minimum turnout 
requirement shall be the same as 
that for approval of mandatory 
student fee increases. 

3: The registration fee com-
mittee shall have a student 
majority which elects a student 
chair. Student members shall be 
appointed by campus govern-
ments." 

Saxon tenned the SBPC letter a 
" prescription" and said "we've 
had your views, we've had them 
before." He catagorized the SBPC 
views as the same from year to 
year. Saxon did, however, tell the 
SBPC. what he would do about the 
guldeJ.inea-''I am going to come up 
with a defensible compromIae" set 

DauidSaxon 

There was no contact with the 
SBPC over the increase, only over 
its implementation. The Council 
had issued a statement opposing 
the across the board $48 increase 
and at the same time urged student 
control over the differential in-
crease. According to Andy 
Schneider, Coop Statewide 
External Affairs Coordinator, 
" Reg fees are collected to provide 
for student cultural, fiscal, and 
social needs. These fees should be 
controlled by the students." 

Saxon recommended that the 
SBPC talk t.o their chancellors 
about the issue of reg fee and the 
guideline. Schneider met with 
Chancellor McElroy last Wed-
nesday to discuss this issue. 

Saxon alsip wants everyone to 
help him in "rylDg to get state 
support, he told the Cowtcil. He 
said he especially wants student 
help in getting the $9 million in

Schneider felt " the ad-

they failed to consult studeib on 
the reg f increase. " 



..... " I tritOD times 
letter to the Eiditor 

McElroy Reaffirms CPB Purposes 
On October 22, 1M Chancellor 

Mc:Elroy reaffirmed the a'e8tion 
cl the Campus Pnwam Board. 
Tbe specific charge cl the CPB 
remalns unchanged to this date: 
"TO PROVIDE BALANCED 
PROGRAMMING IN PER-
FORMING ARTS AND EN-
TERTAINMENT OF HIGH 
QUAUTY THAT IS CONSISTENT 
WITH THE EDUCATIONAL 
OBJECTIVES OF THE UCSD 
COMMUNITY." 

At first glance, it is evident that 
this highly nebulous tenninol~y 
can assume a multitude of in-
terpretations. 

One glaring fact will help to add 
a consistency to the meaning cl 
Cbancellor McElroy's directive: 
ALL of the fllDding for CPB 
programming and operating ex-
penses is paid by YOU, 11IE 
STUDEl'IT. 

Seventy percent of the Board's 
fmancial support is derived frOm 
the Campus Activities Fee (the six 
dollars you pay every quarter) and 
the additiooal money comes from 
the Registration Fee (the one 
hundred dollar . fee you pay each 
quarter to subsidize aU student 
support bureaucracies at UCSD). 

In light of this financial support 
situation, it becomes immediately 
apparent that the charge of the 
Campus Program Board should be 
interpreted • thusly: ALL 
PROGRAMMING OF EDUCA-
TIONAL ENTERTAINMENT AT 
U.C.S.D. SHOULD REFLECT 
STUDENT PREFERENCES AND 
NEEDS. Furthennore in order to 
ensure the validity and viability of 
the execution of this charge, 
STUDENT INPUT AND 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR 
PROGRAMMING 
EDUCATIONAL EN-
TERTAINMENT SHOULD BE 
PURSUED WITH MAXIMUM 
VIGOR AND PERSISTENCE. 

In other words, since students 
pay for programming of en-
tertainment at UCSD, STUDENTS 
SHOULD ACTIVELY HELP 
PLAN AND IMPLEMENT ALL 
SUCH PROGRAMMING. 

The question is: DOES CPB 
PROGRAMMING REFLECT 
STUDENT PREFERENCES? 
Perhaps a quick rundown of the 
administrative structure (i.e. 
bureaucracy) is in order. 

As of now, the Board consists of 
two graduate students, six un-
dergraduates, five faculty and one 
administrator. In addition, 
programming of events is sub- ' 
divided into six categories : these 
are Music (classical, ex-
perimental, etc.), Dance (modern, 

jazz, etc.), Drama, Films, Lec-
tures, and Pop Events (Rock 
concerts, juz,comedy, etc.). 

In pOint of fact, although 
students comprise the majority of 
the Board, only in Fibns, Lectures, 
and Pop Events do students ac-
tively participate in programming 
procedures. In fact, in Music and 
Drama, NO STUDENTS sat on 
these subcommittees last year. 
Surely there must be some 
students at UCSD interested in 
such programming. 

In addition, with regard to films, 
lectures, and concert program-
ming, it is evident that student 
participation and awareness can 
be greatly enhanced. One notable 
example is frequenUy mentioned; 
more ethnic-oriented en-
tertainment (i.e. Soul, Blues JaZz, 
Latino) could be presented. 

Who's at fault for thiS ljituation? 
There are many multifarious 
variables which have contributed 
to this state of affairs. The most 
indelibly consistent factor appears 
to essentially be that the students 
on the Board lack a clear and open 
channel of commWlication with the 
student body at-large. 

While in theory, the student 
representatives on the Board 
represent a studem constituency, 
in reality, there are as inlulated to 
student CMeet·OS as the faculty and 
administrators ! 

The Campus Program Board 
recognizes that an open channel of 
communication is imperative to 
ensure effective progranuning and 
has consequently begun to initiate 
surveys. Yet, surveys in them-
selves are limited tools. What is 
needed is ACTIVE STUDENT 
PARTICIPATION on the sub-
conunittees. 

Therefore, the Board is offering 
an opportunity and a challenge to 
interested students who would like 
to exercise a little self-
detennination in how their money 
is spent.

Possible Change Foreseen In 
Present Quarter System 

By Jeff Fenton 
The poalbillty of a UC system-wide change frcm the present quarter 

system to the semester system was reported in the June 10th issue of the 
UC Berkeley Ddy CaUfomlaD. 

ThIs is a possibility which could have serious consequences. 
Representatives of the faculty a~ UC Berkeley voted overwhebningly in 

favor of the change, although the Board of Regents has the final 
authority. 

In 1966, the University, formerly on the semester system, adopted the 
presem quarter system in an effort to deal with enrollment growth. 
However, a full program of summer classes was never adopted at any 
campua. Also, enrollment Is levelling off, state funding has riot been ~ 
creasing and the entire University is now in a ·~teady state," compared 
to the "go-go growth" of the 19SOB and 1960&. . -

At Berkeley, in a referendum held in fall, 1974, a majority of the 
undergraduate students voted qaai a possible change, while a 
majority Ii graduate students favored It. 

Advantages of the semester system include having more time in a 
given course and more time for faculty to become personally acquainted 
with students. Also, since most California junior college campuses use 
the semester system, transfer students would ~ their transition easier. 
One less fmaI-eum week would be held per year. Since a stodent would 
have fewer different course titles In a year, testbook expenses might 
decrease slightly, 

There would be many disadvantages, also. Since such a change could 
only be instituted at a campus all-at-once, continuing students would have 
severe difficulties, since requirements would have to be modified and 
Wlit values would have to be converted. Students, faculty, ad-
ministration, staff-everyone-would become confused and bewildered. 

Courses .!¥ould have to be restructured, sliced up, and combined, taking 
much valuable professional time which would be better spent on actual 
leaching and research. To.add to the paper sl)Owstonn already raging, a 
new blizzard of papers, catalogs, charts, and guides would have to be 
published. 

The confusion and chaos resulting from the change would be, at least 
initially, as intense as if, all of a sudden, the government were to change 
our measurement system from English to Metric. With all the other 
problems we already face in college life, students should be spared any 
further distress. Pity the poor students, staff, and trees uprooted to fuel 
the paper tornado! . 

The proposal for academic calendar change is a distasteful recipe for 
total chaos. and should be rejected. At least, if the change were to be 
conSidered, the student's voice, in full UC-wlde referendum, should first 
be heard.

Chancellor McElroy responded to 
this idea with a flat, "no way." He 
noted that the Program Review 
Conunittee (PRC) didn't rubber 
stamp anything, and added, "if you 
don't belleve that, attend one Ii the 
meetings." (It should be noted that 
the accrediting report stated that 
student representation on the PRC 
was "llmlted and largely inef-
fectual," but that the committee as 
a whole was seen as extremely 
effective) . 

Both McElroy and Saltman 
agreed that the 10 yelll'l was a 
lengthy time, but noted that the 
university has a "critical and 
stringent process of ongoing self-
study and evaluation. " In addition 
to that procesa, McElroy said that 
there would be a midway 
evaluation by the accrediting 
committee at the five year point.

Still, the entire accrediting 
process has been coming under 
criticism from many quarters. 
Saltman admitted that "we really 
didn't gain much insight from the

report." 1fowever, he added, "it's 
necessary to be callbrated by an

material. But don't play this albwn 
in front of the family. This is a 
much raunchier Pryor than the one 
you've seen on television. Pryor 
describes the difference between 
White and Black women with 
considerable detail, as well as his 
experiences on acid and some 
hassles in a Chinese restaurant. 

Richard Pryor 

With few exceptions, the material is absolutely first-rate. 

. "I don't like movies when they don't have no nlggers in 'em. I saw 
movie of the future called 'Logans Run.' There ain't, no niggers in it. The 
way I figure it WhIte folks ain't planning for us to be here." 
_ "We done malIe enough movies about pimping ... White folks know all 

about pimping, cause we're the biggest whores they got." 
Comedy 'albums have come a long way since the early days of BID 

Cosby. The dialogue of "Bicentennial Nigger" is laced with ample-doses 
of blue language. Indeed, Cosby's "Hey, hey, hey" has given way to 
Pryor's "Hey, motherfucker." 

In keeping with the theme of this albwn, Pryor describes the bice~ 
tennial as "celebrating 200 years of white folks kin kicking ass." And 
although he may never be invited to the White House, it doesn't really 
matter. Richard pryor will be kicking ass for quite a while. 

Very Together, Deodato, MCA reccrds - BaSically the same old fare 
from Eumir Deodato, the king of big production retakes. 

His previowi hits Include the remakes of "Alsa Sprach Zarathustra" 
(2001) and "Rhapsody in Blue." Very Together continues along the same 
lines, with Deodato's versions of "Theme From Star Trek" (done disco 
style) with Henry Mancini's "Peter Gunn." . 

Deodato seems content in hiS current position, indeed even lazy. Under 
no circumstances can he be considered to be extending himself. Very 
Together represents a compotent work by a compotent mus!cian, but 
altogether unexciting.

TIle Great Welcome Week Sbaff1e 
Orientation Week. Welcome Week. Welcome new students to the sprawl 

that is UCSD. Orient them to what It all Is. In five days. 
Don't be ridiculous. All you can do in five days is stage some activities-

that often border on the banality of high school senior week-and try to 
acquaint people with themselves and the campus just a little. All the 
recipients of this attention can hope for is an impression, a (eeling. 

And not a very honest one at that. Orientation Week is a blend of "fun"-
activities and "serious"-activities, mixed in with a little freebie food 
(possibly the last you'll ever get at UCSD). The other 33 weeks are 
reading and writing and a cramming and searching for ways to get away 
from the rou~e, spiritually as well as physically. 

That's a far cry from human checkers. (Human checkers? You'd have 
to be a damn good leaper-and how to tell who's a king?) And banana 
races and marshmallow eating contests and beerchugging. 

Thls is supposed to orient the wide-eyed freshman to "higher 
education?" , 

That's not cOll\Pletely fair, of course. There are other things going on in 
the school year's pre-season week, that some might consider more useful. 
Like readinR skills sessions. Birth control info. Student government talks. 

But guess which activities are better attended? Which would you rather 
attend - a free lunch or a talk on student government? Be honest. 

••••• 
Not that Orientation Week is just for new students. Far from it . It's a 

vital time for student organizations to recrult new blood. A time to live 
and a time to die. A time for whitherlng groups to revitalize themselves 
and for new groups to get started. 

This process takes place most visibly at the Bizzare Bazaar-the aMual 
Student Organizations Fair, sponsored by the Student Center, As one 
student said to another a day before the bazaar: "You should really be 
there. It'll ~ your one good chance to get at aU the new .students." 

Well, a lot of organizations were out there trying last week. The grass 
hump in front of the Student Center was a myriad of signs and earnest-
faced students explaining why their group is worthy of attention. The 
situation would have been complete If each group has only had a barker 
pitching their wares. B.ut alas, no. 

And you could always tell an organization bound for extinction. They 
were at the tables that no one visited. 

••••• 

Possibly the most touching-and revealing-portraits on the Orien-
Iation Week tapestry were those of the freshman women and their 
parents as they prowl the campus, from Ice Cream social to Bizarre 
Bazaar. Invariably, as a friend pointed out, the mother and daughter 
look alike . If Mom dresses neatly, so does daughter. And vice versa. 

The real test, though, would be to compare bow the two look after a 
year in the dorms. Or even a quarter. • 

And that knowledge is bound to sadden the parents, just a little. 
• •••• 

It's during Orientation Week that new students get their first taste of 
the ultimate common experience fot \1GSD students. You can see it at the 
Cashier'S Office, the Bookstore, the cafeterias, the box office. 

Standing In line. More than anything elae-even studying-the common 
student experience. And it's just preparation for the many lines people 
stand in all their lives, like obedient cattie. ~ecause they think they can't 
do anything about it. 

But what If everybody stopped standing in lIne-just said No way, it's 
not fair. Something would have to change, because all the institutions 
people stand In line for depend on ~~~~~ to survive. 

••••• 
And that's Orientation Week. Welcome to the real thing.

New Season, Women's Volleyball 
New Soles for New Season to Open 

. With All-Cal Tourney 
_Cross Country by Roa ICato It ·was only 1ut year that this 

Staff Writer Triton squad, returning most of ita 
Tbe UCSD crou country 

program is back in full gear again 
this fall after a four year absence 
from the campus sports scene. 

Coming off one ~ its most sue- players, dominated the conference 
ceaaful sealOllS ever, the women's · without incurring a loss. It wasn't 
volleyball team headed by coach until the fiDal round of the post· 

season playoffs that the Tritons 
suffered their lone defeat to a 
conference school. In the Cham-
pionship game, Groamont, which 
lOll it's previous encountero with 

U~, edged out the San Diegans 
in two clOlie games, 18-14 and 18-18. 

Coach .Andy Skief was met by 
thirty eager and willing cross-
country hopefula at the squad's 
first ~ lut Monday. 

"I'm ten feet off the ground," 
exclabnecl coach Skief. "This is the 
biggest turnout we've had for 
cross-country here at UCSD since I 
have been here. There were still 
other runners that could not make 
this meeting." 

Leading the way for this year's 
squad will be returning jWlior, 
Doug Jacobson, returning 
sophomores, Jon Halperin and 
Kevin Young, freshmen Alan 
Bernath and Doug Moon, along 
with junior college transfers Mark 
Stienforth and Danny U gale. 

Being made up mainly of fresh-
men and sophomores means that 
this year's contingent of runners 
will be the backbone of the cross-
country and track programs that 
are just now starting to become 
competitive again. 

The harriers take off this 
. Saturday to Golden Gate Park in 
"San Francisco to compete in the 
All-Call tournament being hosted 
by UC Berkeley. In this race the 
Tritons will probably face their 
toughest competition of the season. 
The schedule continues with meets 
in Long Beach, La Mirada, San 
Diego, and the City of Orange, 
while finishing up with the District 
III championships in Biola.

Adding depth to this year's squad 
will be newcomers Amy Harber, a 
freshman out ~ Los Altos High, 
Karen Kachler, and _ Aileen 
Horimoto. HorImoto, who In coach 
Millenbah's words is one of the 
finest players to ever participate at 
UCSD, will join Holly Stewart and 
Teresa Duquette as setters for the 
Tritons. 

On the front line, Andrea Beylen 
will pair up with Harber to form 
what Millenbah feels can be the 
best combination of hitters in the 
conference. Others who will be 
counted on for their all-around 
offensive and defensive skills will 
be Eva Ljungme, Jennifer Freed 
and Karen Flanuner. 

Optimistic about his ream's 
chances, coach Millenbah cites the 
enthlllliasm felt among the team 
members as a means to overcome 
the possible pitfalls of their 
demanding schedule. 

"With only a week's preparation, 
this upcoming tOurnament will be a 
learning experience," conunented 
Millenbah." We'll be going up to 
have a working game but we'll also 
have fun. We may not win this 
tournament but we should do fairly 
well." 

The home opener for the Tritons 
will be against San Diego City 
College next Wednesday at 4 pm in 
the recreation gym. 

Flag Football 
Meetings 
Today 

Team meetings for both men'l'

support, and atl the ad-
miniltrative support'Tor organized 
research. Of pararll.,.t concern 
was the llbrary SUJ» rt, which is 
30% below the UC n e age. 

Chancellor McElroy said that he 
thinks thole areas will be "sub-
stantially improve(i" this year, 
and "much better than previous 
years." He recognized that the 
" due share hadn 't been ac-
complished," and seemed satisfied 

with everything but this year's 
stude.-TA raUo. 

The final page of the accrediting 
report noted that, "no one at UCSD 
denies that problems exis t. 
Administrative officers and others 
were quick to acknowledge them 
and to express detenninatioo to 
deal with them effectively." 

Time, hopefully not 10 more 
years and the next accrediting 
report, will tell.
