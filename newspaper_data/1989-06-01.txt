A.S. Allocates $360 to 
Lawyer Consultation Fee 
By LAURA PROCTOR 
Senior Staff Writer 

The A.S. Council last night 
approved a proposal to allocate 
$360 from the General Unallo-
cateQ Fund for a lawyer consulta-
tion fee related to the ongoing 
issue of G PA calculations for pre-
engineering majors . 

For $360, a lawyer would spend 
approximately four hours re-
earching the issue and would 

then, according to the resolution, 
write an opinion "regarding the 
legal rights and options of the 
ASUCSD and of the individual 
students on this issue." 

The admission practices of 
UCSD's engineering department 
are allegedly in violation of Uni-
versity of California systemwide 
academic regulations. 

When most UC students repeat 
a class for which they have 
received a nonpassing grade, only 
the second grade is averaged into 
their GPA. 

For pre-engineeringstudents at 
UCSD, both grades are used in 
grade-point calculations, which 
in turn determine whether or not 
the student will be admitted to the 
major. 

Many councilmembers ques-
tioned whether the student body 
would want $360 of their funds 
spent on four hours of research 
and a single letter from an attor-
ney. 

The issue of whether or not the 
opinion could realistically lead to 
any legal action on the part of the 
students was also raised, and the 
A.S. 's degree of legal autonomy 
was debated. 

As the proposal's author, Stu-
dent Advocate Bard-Alan Finlan 
spoke in favor of the resolution, 

urging Council to begin a proce s 
that would be "the most signifi-
cant thingthatany A.S. has done. 

"You all ran on students' rights 
issues," he reminded the Council. 
"The question is are you willing to 
uphold this?" 

He said that since the student 
body had voted in favor of the 
referendum to look into hiring a 
lawyer, they would probably be in 
favor of this resolution as well . 

Vice President-Administrative 
Alex Wong stepped down from 
his neutral position as the meet-
ing's chairperson to argue against 
the proposal. He objected to hir-
ing a lawyer because he felt there 
were other options that should be 
looked into first. 

"Do we want to spend $360 to 
ask this person for counsel on a 
specific issue?" he asked the 
Council, adding that "We have 
not pursued our administrative 
options." 

"I don't think this is an appal-
ling thing to ask for," Wong con-
ceded, but nonetheless advised 
the Council to pursue other 
courses of action before spending 
$360 on four hours of work. 

A.S. Advisor Randy Woodard 
agreed with Wong that other 
options had not been sufficiently 
looked into. 

"I would like to see some work 
done by the A.S. - some up-
plementary research to Bard 's 
resolution on where the A.S. 
stands with the administration," 
he said. 

Woodard noted that it is unclear 
whether or not the A.S. is legally 
able to sue the University, since 
they are a part of it. If the A.S. is 
unable to sue the University, he 
asked, then why spend the money 
on a lawyer's opinion? 

"In my opinion," he said, "You

should look at some more admin-
istrative remedies." 

According to Finlan, looking 
into legal, not administrative 
solutions, would be most effective 
when dealing with the University. 

"I am not advocating that with 
all matters in life you use attor-
neys," he said, "[But] if we're

Committees Reject Governor's 
Proposed Student Fee Increase 

A major legislative victory for 
the University of California Stu-
dent Association (UCSA) was 
won in Sacramento this week. 
Both State Senate and Assembly 
Education Budget Committees 
have rejected Governor George 
Deukmejian's proposed 10 percent 
increase to UC student fees for 
1989-90 and restored it to the 
three percent called for by state 
law governing such increases. 

unanimously in support of stu-
dents . 

Mayor O'Connor Asks Deukmejian 
To Declare 'State of Emergency' 

"I am very gratified that legisla-
tors agree with students that the 
student pocketbook is no place to 
look for money to fill in the gaps 
in the state budget," aid Tracey 
Woodruff, president of UCSA. 

"Since Student Summit '89 last 
Februarv, UCSA has lobbied the 
legislature vigorously to eliminate 
this tax on students. Students 
have written letters to, called, and 
visited legislators to win their 
support for the fee rollback. Our 
success this week shows that legis-
lators listen when students speak," 
Woodruff said. 

Assembly Member Campbell 
noted, "Closing low-income citi-
zens of California out of our pub-
lic universities is a short-sighted 
way of saving money for the state. 
A well-educated , diverse Califor-
nia is a bountiful California, and 
the public university system is key 
to achieving that goal. I applaud 
the actions taken this week by my 
colleagues ... 

UCSA Campus Offices have 
mounted a massive campaign in 
recent weeks to convince the 
Governor and the Legislature to 
provide more money to the public 
university system. Students from 
all over the state have been travel-
ling to Sacramento to personally 
lobby legislators. Student leaders 
from San Diego, Santa Barbara, 
Riverside, San Francisco, Santa 
Cruz, and Davis have all planned 
Capitol visits.

In response to the increasing 
problem of gang-related violence 
and drive-by shootings, San Diego 
Mayor Maureen O'Connor recent-
ly asked Governor George Deuk-
mejian to declare a "State of 
Emergency" in the San Diego 
neighborhoods where gang vio-
lence occurs most frequently. 

Such a declaration would allow 
the city to receive direct grant 
funding from the state. 

"I'm asking the Governor to 
allocate a one-time $34 million 
grant to San Diego to put more 
police power on the front lines of 
this battle against drug lords," 
O'Connor said. 

She also said that the money 

could come from the "recently 
discovered $2.5 billion surplus in 
the state budget." 

If the request is approved, 
O'Connor said the city would use 
the money to put more police 
officers on the streets, expand 
San Diego's Drug Abuse Resist-
ance Education program, improve 
intervention and rehabilitation 
programs, and build additional 
detention facilities . 

The decision to find a way to 
increase funding for the crime 
prevention programs may have 
been motivated by the recent 
drive-by shooting of a pregnant 
woman, said Paul Downey, the 
Mayor' press secretary. 

According to Downey, the 
Mayor's office had been trying to 
find a way to allocate money for 

litttti! t'J 

the problem, but "they didn't think 
of declaring a State of Emergency 
until [recently]." 

The request was made under a 
provision of the California Code, 
which states that the Mayor may 
request a State of Emergency 
providing that "conditions are, or 
are likely.to be, beyond the control 
of the servies, personnel, equip-
ment, and facilities of [the city of 
San Diego)." 

Such a request is exempt from 
the provisions of the Gann limit, 
which limits the amount of money 
that the state and county govern-
ments can spend each year. 

Unfortunately, said Downey, 
the request hasn't been approved 
yet . "Since the Governor hasn't 
said anything either way yet, we're 
hoping to hear an approval."

Davis Associated Students Propose 
Erradication of the term "dorms" 

DA VIS - A resolution encouraging the abolition of 
the u e of the term dorms by UC Davi and its units 
in reference to on-campus housing facilities wa 
introduced by Councilmember Steve Schwab. 

If approved, the council will adopt and promote the 
use of the term "residence halls" in place of "dorms" 
when referring to on-campus housing. 

According to the California Aggie, the re olution 
tates that it is e ential that tudent leaders support, 

rather than defeat, the objectives of the Residence Life 
Program by promoting positive examples and ideolo-
gies on campus. 

Residence Life believes that there are innumerable 
learning opportunities within the residence halts -
opportunities for individual and groups to clarify 
and reassess personal and community values, develop 
personal ideas, relationships and experience free-
doms in their new environment, according to the text 
of the resolution. 

Members of the ASUCD Council will be voting on 
this issue tonight at Davis. 

UCB's Daily Californian Attacked 
BERKELEY - The ASUC Berkeley Senate 

voted Wednesday, May 10 to approve a drasti-
cally altered version of a bill that expresses discontent 
with The Daily Californian's endorsements for ASUC 
executive offices. 

The bill calls for the message to be placed on the 
front page of the election supplement, a paid adver-
tisement that usually appears in the Daily Californian. 

The original bill, written by Sen. Brian Dunn, 
called for candidates to be declared ineligible if they 
attended a Daily Californian endorsement meeting. 

Although the bill retains all of its assertions regard-
ing the interview process, it no longer seeks to dis-
courage candidates from participating in endorsement 
interviews, and excludes an amendment that would 
revoke The Daily Californian's status as the only 
"campus newspaper" that can print an election 
supplement. 

Dunn, who ran unsuccessfully for executive vice 
president and did not receive the paper's endorsement, 
states in the bill that the newspaper's endorsements 

BLOOM COUNTY 

"give a supreme advantage to those candidate who 
are endorsed." 

He al 0 states that the endor ement interviews are 
biased because "different questions are asked to dif-
ferent candidates." 

Many senators who spoke in favor of the bill said 
that the paper, the only free daily publication di trib-
uted on campus, has too much influence on the out-
come of the electio ns because students may follow the 
paper's endorsement blindly.

UCSB Faculty and Staff Dissatisfied 
With Status of Black Faculty on Campus 

SANTA BARBARA - Several prominent UCSB 
faculty and staff members expressed dis atisfaction 
with current campus policies on recruitment and ret-
ention of black faculty at a forum held last month by 
the UCS B Black studies department. 

Facu lty complaints contrasted sharply with admin-
istration figures indicating that UCS B has a higher 
percentage of Latino, Black and Native American 
faculty members than the UC system's overall aver-
age, and with the declaration that UCS B "is commit-
ted to increasing the number of minority faculty 
members on campus," according to a May 24 univer-
sity press release. 

Profes or Gerald Horne, chairperson of the Black 
studies department, cited national reports that indicated 
difficulties in recruiting and retaining ethnic minorities 
for faculty positions may eventually cripple the nation's 
economy, adding that "this campus has particularly 
daunting problems." 

Specific areas of concern for Horne and others are 
affordable housing, advancement opportunities, 
employment for faculty pouses and existing racial 
attitudes among white faculty member . 

But Julius Zelmanowitz, associate vice chancellor 
of academic affairs, believes the problems afflicting 
recruitment and retention of ethnic minority faculty 
"CUI across all disciplines, all facul ty members who are 
in demand across the nation." 

He also said the underrepre entation of minorities 
at UCS B is not due to a lack of active recruiting, but 
is the result of a small pool of minority candidates. 

In 1986, for exam ple, white Americans earned 
20,583 doctoral degrees, whereas Blacks accounted for 
only 820 uch degree . 

Many of those at the forum believe that, because of 
the low number and high demand for qualified ethnic 
minorities, the university must "sweeten the pot" if it 
hopes to attract them. 

Horne said there is additional reluctance among 
persons of color to come to UCSB because "often-
times, [they] would prefer to be in more urban areas."

Legal Tips for Students on Moving 
out of Off-Campus Housing 

With the end of the year rapidly approaching, 
many student commuters are wondering what is going 
to happen with their moving plans for the summer. 
One common question that students wonder about is: 
"Can I get my rental deposit back?" 

California law states that only the part of the 
deposit which is reasonably necessary to pay lor the 
unpaid rent, repair damages caused by the tenant, and 
cleaning the apartment may be kept by the landlord. 

Within two weeks after you have moved out, you 
as a tenant, must receive an itemized statement in 
writing explaining what was done with your security 
deposit. The landlord cannot withhold your security 
deposit to cover the cost of normal wear and tear. If 
you do not receive your refund within two weeks, you 
should contact the landlord in writing (preferably by 
certified mail with return receipt requested). Keep a 
copy of your letter for your own records. If there is a 
disagreement with your landlord regarding your 
refund, you should visit the Student Legal Services 
Office. It may be necessary to file a claim in Small 
Claims Court. 

Another question students are concerned about is: 
"How much notice do I have to give when I decide to 
move out?" 

Normally, if you pay once a month you should give 
30 days notice in writing. If you do not give proper 
written notice, you may have to pay additional rent. 
This, of course, does not apply if you signed a long-
term lease.

"Thunder is good, thunder is impressive, bur it is ligh tning that does 

the work, " 
- Mark Twain, 1908 

SAM CLEMENS WAS a natural, a born counterpuncher with a whip-quick mind and a fine musician's insti nct for stringing words together - even when it came to the delicate matter of 
changing his own name to Mark Twain, a phrase he picked up from 
hanging around riverboat people during his youth on the Mis issippi. 

"Mark twainr'was a shout from the foredeck up to the wheelhouse, 
saying the depth-line was wet up to the second mark, or exactly two 
fathoms deep., . , It would be like me changing my name at the age of 
16 to something like Third and Ten, or Double Overtime. Or maybe 
World B. Free, which has already been done. 

Twain lived most of his life in an almost mystical state of awe 
regarding the powers of Mother Nature. But he never worked with 
dynamite. It was not invented until he was 31 years old . 

It was a maniac Swede named Alfred Nobel who did it, and he felt 
such remorse about the deadly potential of his invention that he 
dedicated all the profits from his patent to an annual award for the 
most successful effort to prevent war in the world: the Nobel Peace 
Prize. 

Nobel' fears were soonjustified in wars all over the globe, where the 
winners were usually the ones with the most dynamite. 

These quantum leap on the dark underbelly of pure energy re earch 
are not observed as public holidays in most places, but they are marked 
in red ink on any physics calendar and often celebrated in private by 
relatives, scientists and Bomb Worshipers on all levels of the universal 
social strata. 

My friend George Stranahan fits all three of these categorie . He is a 
nuclear physicist , a linear descendant of Alfred Nobel and a certified 
black belt in the field of random explosives usage - a complex, 
little-known art in which the "No. I fuse man" (the fool with the Zippo) 
is required to build his own bomb and accept total responsibility for 
whatever happens when it explodes, 

B OM B FREAKS BELIEVE that demolition is a very preci e art where the price of sloppiness is usuaJly death or disfigurement. But they lie. 
Demolition - no matter what they tell you - is essentially a giddy 

business . It is a strange mix of high art with no god, and a low sport 
with no commissioner. Bomb fever is, in fact, a hideous syndrome 
worse than anything in nature except meat sickness and swine fever. 

I was broodmg on these things on a bright afternoon last week when 
I was feeling on a bit of a roll. ... It was Derby Day, as I recall, and I 
had just won heavily. I had also taken delivery, that morning, of a 
atchel of double-ended industrial smoke bombs that I was eager to 

test. 
"Where is Stranahan?" I asked my friend Paula, a professional 

horsewoman who was deeply depressed at her failure to pick the Derby 
winner . . .. But I was in a whoopee kind of mood , seized by a notion 
that it was time to kick out the jams. 

t'rang George. He was going into the hospital on Monday for serious 
neck surgery, which was causing him to lose his sense of humor. It was 
time for a bomb - a monumental kind of bomb that we had never 
done before . George needed it, I wanted it, and Paula agreed to 
cooperate if we would set it off underneath a low-flying aircraft. 

George arrived in IO minutes , screeching into the driveway with a 
carload of fuses, caps and Dita-Gel, which we immediately hauled up 
to the back pasture where I was keeping the old Jeep station wagon. 
and I figured this was it. 

I T WAS GETTlNG dark as we loaded the bomb into the Jeep. I twisted the six fuses of the three double-ended smoke bombs together and wrapped them loosely with thin strips of duct tape. It 
was delicate work. George attached dynamite caps to his sausages of 
jellied nitroglycerine and clamped them in place with his teeth . 

We were in for a shrapnel display of considerable magnitude. Ingots 
of jagged steel would be blasted in many directions at speeds up to 
8,8()() mph. We had hooked up a powerful si ren and aimed it down at 
the road in order to paralyze traffic for 20 or 30 seconds,just in case the 
bomb blew sideways. 

S-t happens, as they say, but not this time, On this day, our bomb 
was perfect. I fired up the smoke bombs and then scanned the hillsides 
for unlucky trespassers as George lit the Dita-Gel fuse - which he said 
was exactly three minutes long, but he ran like a cheetah anyway, 
leaping ditches and coils of old barbed wire as we fled in real fear 
toward the house. 

The next I IO seconds hummed with an ungodly tension that smart 
people will tell you bombing is all about , It was like waiting for a 
volcano to blow, an extremely keen sense of time ticking down in slow 
motion to an instant of terrifying possibility .. .. We had done the deed , 
and now we waited , 

The blast was like the end of the world right in front of us. The 
gunpowder went first, a sharp orange flash that seemed to lift the jeep 
straight out of its chassis and J()() feet up in the sky, and then came a 
deep rolling ground shock. 

Huge chunks of red shrapnel hovered slowly a bove us - the hood, 
the roof, the doors - and then they began to co me down, which made 
for an interesting moment. We were stunned into pillars of salt. I 
remember watching with helpless awe as the tailgate floated down and 
bashed a crater in the yard about 50 feet in front of us . 

It was a magic moment. We stared a t each other and laughed, Then 
we went back in the house and drank whisky, feeling extremely 
peaceful as we began making plan for the next one. 

Are TAs 
Competent? 
Editor: 

I have a complaint. Here I sit 
staring at my chemistry problems: 
my head filled wi lh a mishmash of 
information but no way to relate 
it to the homework. 

I have worked on these prob-
lem over a nd over, but the solu-
tion I get are still not correct. The 
final step, I think to myself. is just 
to wait for discussion section and 
there I know my questio ns will be 
a nswered, a nd t he pro ble ms 
solved . Or will t hey? 

I have been a t the fine insti tu-
tion of UCSD for almost a year 
now, and I have yet to have a TA 
that understands the topic and 
can explain the homework with-
out the students'help. Many times 
I have at back in my seat and 
watched a T A fumble through 
even the simplest of pro blems, 
and just avoid the more difficult 
ones claiming that we, the stu-
dents, "don't need to know that 
for the final." 

The questions were assigned, 
obviously for a reason. I have 
gone to the e men and women 
seeking guidance to help me get 
through (and hopefully with good 
grades) my various classes, but I 
am disappointed with the help, or 
lack thereof. 

When I came here I assumed 
that if a person was a T A they 
would have to have command of 
the course material. I heard over 
and over that if I had any prob-
lems with homework or under-
sta nding the subject matter I was 
to go see the T A - that's what 
they are there for. 

The students are suppo ed to 
utilize the teaching assistants, let 
them help us grasp the topic, and 
succeed in our classes. One pro-
fessor told a class I was into use 
the T As as our personal slave, 
and to never let them have wasted 
office hours . 

Well I have tried to follow the 
advice, gone to ection, gone to 
office hours and problem ses ions, 
but I am sorry to say that my 
confidence in the abilities of T As 
i very low, I'd really hope that 
I've just received a bad crop of 
UCSD TA and that my com-
plaint is only personal, but ome-
how I don't think that's the case.

Judicial Board Reply 
Editor: 

As a mem ber of the A.S. Judi-
cial Board who did not support 
the decision by the majority of the 
Board, I am responding to the 
criticism of t he Board's decision 
to allow the V.P. external elect ion 
results to stand. 

I do believe that the Board has 
set a precedent that may be 
ambiguously interpreted by next 
year's A.S. ca ndidates. The Board 
found Migacz guilty of commit-
ting a violation and yet did not 
disqualify her from holding office. 

I fear that future candidates 
may be tempted to violate the 
rules in the hope that even if they 
are found guilty of committing a 
violation, the final appeals body 
will dismiss the charge. However, 
before prospective candidate act 
hastily, they should be a ware of 
why the Board reacted the way it 
did. 

The Board felt that it could 
declare election results null and 
void on ly if the plaintiff (Craig 
Peters) showed that the defend-
ant (Mishka Migacz) had com-
mitted a violatio n, and that he 
also demonstra te that it substan-
tially affected the election results. 
Peters did prove that M igacz 
committed a violation by cam-
paigning door-to-door in the Muir 
apartments. However, Peters did 
not present any proof as to how 

many persons in the apartments 
M igacz contacted. A minimum of 
five people would have been 
needed to have been contacted to 
have possibly altered the election 
resu lts (809 to 804). 

I fe lt that there was no need for 
Peters to have proven the exact 
number of people contacted in 
order for h im to have proven the 
election results were affected . 
However, the majority of the 
Board fe lt it was unfairto disqual-
ify someone without specific . 
proof. Therefore, if in t he future 
the plaintiff shows com pelling 
proof that a vio lation occurred, 
a nd shows specific proof that it 
affected the election, then future 
Boards should have no reason to 
excuse the accused, accord ing to 
the precedent just set. 

Although I was against the 
majority opinion, I hold that those 
Board mem bers who voted in 
favor of Migacz were in no way 
biased in their decision. I know of 
no Board member who knew 
either Peters or Migacz. Neither 
did I hear any member speak of 
Peters with dislike, nor of Migacz 
with sympathy. I sincerely believe 
that each Board member acted in 
the interests of fa irness and jus-
tice, as they individually perceived 
the e ideals.

The UCSD Guardian OPINION Thursday. June I. 1989 5 

"Black Magic" Racist So what were you thinking when you decided on the title? 
Probably that it would be nice to 
have a theme based on the 1930s 
song, "That Old Black Magic." 
Innocent enough. 

Praise for Plays 
EcUtor: 

As I'm sure you're all aware, 
there has been an increase in the 
recognition of racist (subtle and 
otberwise) gestures in the UCSD 
community. As student leaders, 
faculty, and staff, I know it is far 
from our goal to condone any 
racist behavior. That is why it was 
such a shock to me when I picked 
up a copy of the Warren Briefs 
and found that the theme for the 
semi-formal is "That Old Black 
Magic." 

For those of you who are/ were 
unaware, I will state it plainly. 
This is a prime example of subtle 
racism instituted in our jargon 
that oppresses and upholds the 
existing racist society in which we 
live. 

Briefly, the term "Black Magic" 
is racist because it caters to the 
ever-existing theme in our society 

I I 

of black being bad and white 
being somehow better, i.e. good. 
To exemplify this, we need not go 
far and examine the opposite of 
"Black Magic," "White Magic," 
which is considered "less bad." 

To cite other examples, devil's 
food (black) vs. angel's food (white) 
cake, and we mustn't leave out the 
ever-present symbol of bad luck, 
the black cat. Wake up people! 
We have to recognize these things. 

I would like to believe that 
when this theme was decided on 
no one planned for it to be offen-
sive, much less racist. It is because 
I am a student leader and most of 
you are my peers/ supervisors, 
that 1 feel it necessary to call 
attention to this matter. As peo-
ple who are directly affecting stu-
dents, we must, I repeat, must 
recognize the implications, subtle 
or otherwise, of what we do and 
say.

However, 1 know of at least 
one member of council that called 
attention to the racist overtones 
of this term. Why was she ignored? 
Council should have recognized 
that if it is offensive to one person, 
it certainly will be offensive to 
others. 

In closing, I would like to state 
that my purpose in writing this 
letter is not to evoke a stream of 
defensive replies. Rather, '1 want 
everyone, students and admini-
strators alike, to closely examine 
their thought patterns and realize 
the implications of what we do 
and what we say. "That Old Black 
Magic" is a prime example of 
what we should be trying to get 
away from.

Editor: 
I am writing in response to last 

week's Undergraduate Theater 
Festival. It gives me great plea-
sure to praise everyone who was 
involved in the production of the 
five plays, and also to encourage 
those who chose not to take 
advantage of the opportunity to 
attend this wonderfully spectacu-
lar event to do so in the future. 

From 7 p.m. to almost mid-
night Wednesday through Sun-
day of last week, one could go to 
Warren Theater, relax in a chair, 
and partake (not just view) of five 
different situations - each-with 
its own poignant message. One: 
could not just sit there all comfor-
table in a chair and watch the 
actors work through their lines. 

Instead, one was actively in-
volved in the conflict being pres-

ented, as was I, and for a few 
preciow hours the stresses and 
turmoil of classes seemed unim-
portant. There were limes when 
the action seemed so real that one 
could feel the tension in the air 
and the audience became uncom-
fortable with the ensuing scene. It 
seemed that real. 

Guardian, I hope you publish 
this letter because too often the 
reviews printed in your paper are 
not complimentary enou&h when 
praise is indeed needed. The peo-
ple involved in theater and V A 
need to be appreciated, for at 
times they can provide true art to 
a bunch of tired and stagnated 
students who really need these 
artistic excursions. And for the 
people who didn't see the festival, 
you really missed out.

OPINION The UCSD Guardian 

Q and A: 
What should the state do with this year's budget surplus? 

Considering the ongoing debate about 
environmental protection in California and 
the nation, I believe that the budget surplus 
should be appropriately allocated to protec-
tion agencies of the state, and hopefully, the 
nation will follow suit. 

Tanya O'Conner 
Freshperson, Fifth 

Political Science 

The surplus money should be put to use in 
cleaning up our environment, especially the 
chemical wastes that are being dumped into 
the ocean. It'/l be nice to the clean beaches 
along the California coastline. 

Richard Kim 
Senior, Revelle 

Biology 

The state could distribute the surplus 
among centers of higher education, mandat-
ing that it be spent to improve existingfacili-
ties, rather than build new ones. 

David Hall 
Junior, Revelle 

Urban Studies and Planning 

The surplus money should be used to con-
struct a more elaborate faculty club, more 
fountains at the Price Center, and the rest 
should be used for AIDS education and to 
help California's homeless.

Minority Student 
Enrollment Up 
Over Last Five 
Years, Regents' 
Report Shows 

The annual enrollment of mi-
nority fresh person students at the 
University of California has in-
creased steadily over the past five 
years, following a similar increase 
in the number of minority appli-
cants during that same period. 

The figures were contained in a 
report outlining application, ad-
mission and enrollment statistic 
for all entering freshpersons and 
transfer students for the years 
1984 through 1988. The report 
was presented to the U C Board of 
Regents at the Board's May meet-
ing in San Francisco. 

The report was compiled by the 
office of William Frazer, senior 
vice president for academic affairs. 

"Inherent in the University'S 
admission policy is the goal of 
offering a place for every Califor-
nia resident applicant who applies 
on time and meets the eligibility 
requirements," Frazer told the 
Regents. "Achieving this goal has 
become increasingly difficult in 
recent years because of growth in 
the number of applicants . ~ 

In addition to enrollment fig-
ures, the report also presented an 
academic profile of both fresh-
persons and transfer students 
including information on such 
categories as grade point aver-
ages, campus choices, and selec-
tion of academic majors. 

The report showed an increase 
in the number and percentage of 
enrolled fresh persons for all eth-
nic categories, with the exception 
of white students, over the past 
five years. The sharpest percen-
tage rise (100 percent) occurred 
among American Indians, who 
doubled in number from 115 
fresh persons in 1984 to 230 fresh-
persons in 1988. 

The enrollment of black fresh-
persons rose by 15.5 percent; Chi-
cano freshpersons by 48 percent; 
Latino fresh persons by 78 per-
cent; Filipino freshpersons by 24.5 
percent; and Asian/ Asian Amer-
ican fresh persons by 31.5 percent. 

The number of white students 
enrolling as freshpersons declined 
by 4.8 percent, from 12,404 in 
1984 to 11,805 in 1988. 

While the total number of fresh-
persons admitted to the Univer-
sity increased by 19 percent , the 
percentage and number of stu-
dents admitted by special action 
declined from 6.6 percent in 1984 

to 5.2 percent in 1988. 
Contributing to this drop was 

the pressure to accommodate the 
sharply increased number of elig-
ible applicants and the fact that 
an increasing number of students 
served by the University'S affir-
mative action programs are eligi-
ble for regular admission. 

NEWS 
following the 'establishment of a 
variety of campus programs to 
improve the transfer rate of com-
munity college students to the 
University. 

As was true for fresh person 
applicants, approximately one-
half of California's transfer stu-
dents reside in Los Angeles and 

San FranCISco Bay Area counties. 
Unlike .fresh person applicants, 

however, transfer students do not 
take advantage of the mUltiple 
campus application option, ac-
cording to the report. 

The overall entering grade point 
average of regularly admitted 
transfer students was 3. 19 in fall 

Thur da)" June I, 1989 7 

of 1988. 
According to the report, over 

60 percent of the enrolled transfer 
students were not eligible for 
admission to the University of 
California as fresh persons, prim-
arily because they lacked some of 
the required high school subjects 
and their grades were too low. 

The profile of new students 
presented in the report showed 
the great majority of fresh persons 
(81.8 percent) coming from Cali-
fornia with over one-half (56.9 
percent) residing either in Los 
Angeles or San Francisco Bay 
Area counties. Only 48 percent of 
the state's high school graduates 
reside in t hose areas. 

Student Nominated for S.D. Emmy 

Some 20 percent of San Fran-
cisco Bay Area high school grad-
uates are eligible for UC admis-
sion, the highest rate in California 
and well above the 12.5 percent 
statewide rate set by the Califor-
nia Master Plan for Higher Edu-
cation. 

Scores on standardized tests 
for entering UC freshpersons 
compare well with those for stu-
dents nationally, the report shows. 
The mean SAT on math and ver-
bal scores for UC students aver-
aged 85 to 95 points higher than 
national scores and the overall 
high school grade point average 
of regularly admitted freshpersons 
who enroll was 3.68 in the fall of 
1988. 

After a three-year decline, the 
number of transfer applications 
increased by 3.3 percent last year,

An instructional video co-
produced by UCSD senior Nancy 
Shumovich has been nominated 
by judges from the National 
Academy of Television Arts and 
Sciences for a San Diego Emmy 
Award . 

According to Visual Arts Un-
dergraduate Coordinator B.J . 
Barclay, this is the first time that a 
student in the department has been 
nominated for a San Diego Emmy 
Award. 

The nominated video that 
Shumovich and San Diego State 
University student Shari Kotzen 
co-produced and directed is en-
titled "San Diego Fire Depart-
ment Training," and is a compila-
tion of clips from previously 
produced training shows. 

The video "covers a range of 
topics from a drill, [to) how to do 
elevator rescues, [to] firefighters 
singing songs," Shumovich said.

She explained how her video 
unit operates. First, they are paged 
and "we respond by going out on 
an ambulance that has visual 
equipment instead of emergency 
provisions and go out as close to 
the fire as we can," she said. 

"Our focus is different than 
that of the media and the fire-
fighters in that we concentrate on 
what firefighters are doing," she 
continued. 

Shumovich, a communication 
and visual arts double major, has 
been working as a video intern at 
the San Diego Fire Department 
since last July , and said that 
producing the firefighting training 
shows utilizes her "programming, 
writing, scripting, photography, 
and editing experience." 

Her supervisors at the fire 
department praised Shumovich's 
video work. 

"Nancy's character and motiva-
tion is that of a self starter ... Her 
work is viewed as professional by 
me and the vendors of EMT 
manufactured products" who want 

to use her videos as a sales device 
across the nation to send to fire 
departments," Training Officer 
Michael Reed said. 

Currently, fire stations buy 
broadcasting time on San Diego's 
Learning Channel and air Shumcr 
vich's shows three times a month 
so that firefighters can watch 
them. 

Shumovich said that her theory-
motivated education at UCSD 
played an important role in de-
veloping her current skills as a 
video producer. 

Visual arts and communication 
classes gave her "the background 
for an internship to creatively put 
things together," she said. 

As a 1990 graduate, Shumovich 
plans to pursue a career in video 
production and hopes the recogni-
tion from the nomination will 
help her to get hired by a local 
television station. 

She said that "It's an honor to 
be nominated ... I've put a lot of 
time into [video] production, so 
it's nice to be recognized."

'The Littlest Defector' Visits San Diego 
By FREDRIC HAMBER 
Stoff Writer 

The "littlest defector" has grown 
up. 

Walter Polovchak , from the 
oviet Ukraine, attracted national 

attention nine years ago when he 
sought asylum at the age of 12, 
making him the youngest Soviet 
defector in U.S. h istory. He was 
in town last week to tell the story 
of his years oflegal battles, and of 
his life in the U.S. 

In 1980 the Polovchak family 
first came to the U. ., where some 
relatives had emigrated before 
them. Walter Polovchak began 
his story, however, by telling of a 
visit by his aunt from Santa Bar-
bara to his hometown of Sambir. 
After that visit, Walter 's parents 
started thinking of trying to emi-
grate in order to pro\'ide a better 
education for Walter and his older 
sister. 

They applied for exit visas and 
were successively denied for sev-
eral years until Walter's father -
who Walter remembers as a man 
well-versed in the ways of the 
black market and of obtai ning 
official favors - befriended an 
agent of the KG B. 

"Every time we got denied, he'd 
write letters to Brezhnev, 'til luck-
ily, in 1979, we got our permis-
sion. A lot of people think we 

came for a vacation," Polovchak 
aid. 

After arriving in Chicago, WaI-
ter's father had an almost instant 
change of mind, and began com-
plaining about America . This 
a tonished Walter and his sister, 
who were dazzled by everything 
they saw. 

By wanting to remain 
in the U.S. against his 
parents wishes, Walter 
was seeking legal rights 
which would not even 
be granted to an Amer-
ican minor. 

"I walked into a store; I'd never 
een shelves filled up with food 

from top to bottom - with peo-
ple waiting to pay! I noticed even 
dogs have their own aisle !" WaI-
ter recalled. 

One night, Walter overheard 
his father telling his mother that 
he wa going to go back to the 
Soviet Unio n, with or without her 
and the family. Walter believes 
that his fat her had a girlfriend 
back home, but said that his 
father wanted the whole family to 
go back together, to avoid possi-
ble recriminations from the gov-
ernment. 

\11 
Walter and his sister h id out for 

a few days at the home of a cou-
sin. Since his sistel was 17 years 
old, she had reached legal adult-
hood in the Soviet Ukraine, and 
thu was independent from her 
parents. Walter, however, as a 12-
year-o ld, was in a much more 
precariou legal position. 

When a police officer, accom-

panied by Walter's father and a 
Polish translator ("They couldn't 
find the Ukranian one," Walter 
laughed) apprehended Walter, 
they took him to the police head-
quarters. His sister arrived with 
an Ukranian-speaking attorney, 
who was granted temporary cus-
tody of Walter. 

This was just the beginning. By 

wanting to remain in the U.S. 
agains t his parents ' will, Walter 
was seeking legal rights which 
would not even be granted to an 
American citizen who was a legal 
minor. 

The American Civil Libertil':s 
Union took his parents' side, and 
the court battles continued for

Neon Art Symbolizes 'The American Spirit' 
By ANDREA AD LEMAN 
Contributing Fea/ures Editor 

.. eon IS associated with the 
highest aspirations and fanta ies 
of the American dream as well as 
the lowest expression of commer-
cialism and banality There is no 
other an form that is as symbohc 
of the Amencan spirit." 

So wrote Llli Laklch, founder 
and director of the Museum of 

eon Art In Lo~ Angeles, in her 
autobiographical Neon Lovers 
Glow in the Dark. Lakich is one 
of nine anists whose work is 
being shown in the exhibit ~Neon, ~ 
which is currently on display in 
both the Grove Gallery and the 
Price Center Ballroom lounge. 

Although visually appealtng, 
neon art is difficult to define. 
Grove Gallery Director Maryann 
Callery quipped that, "It's a gas!" 

On a more analytical note, 
Crafts Center Director Ron Carl-
son feels that neon's versatili ty 
helps define it. 

"Neon pervades a lot of differ-
ent type of styles and mediums 
and it's a nice complement because 
it's such pure, intense color," he 
said. " It 's a wonderful addition to 
art, and it's used in painting, it 's 
u ed in sculpture, it's used just by 
it~elf. 

"It's kind of a mysterious sub-
stance," he continued . "It 's not a 
light bulb and it's ki nd of strange 
and you can do a lot with it ." 

Although neon ha been in 
existence since the early twentieth 
century, artists did not begin to 
experiment with the medium until 
the '60s. 

Both Lakich and Carlson feel 
that neon as an art form has 
undergone a revitalization in 
recent decades. 

As for the future of neon art, 
Carlson noted, "I think we'll see 
kind of a renaissance in it; and 

James Soe Nyun. a student in the Crafts Center's beginning neon 
class, works at the glassblower. 

then I think it will probably fade 
out again, because everythi ng i~ 
kind of cyclical. 

"It's technology that has been 
u ed for an industry and it's finally 

breaking out of that industry and 
people are finding it as a tool to 
express them elves." 

T he industry to which Carson 
referred is the sign industry, which 

used neon for advertisements from 
the '20s to the '50s, according to 
Lakich's book. 

One of the more prominent 
works in "Neon" is "Pop 
Shark," a 14-foot creation by 
Michael Fletchner in which sha rks 
pop out of a toaster. Fletchner 
characterized his work as "hard to 
describe mechanical neon work, 
numerous kinetic systems." 

"Dodeca Rockola" is a visual, 

"Neon pervades a 
lot of different types 
of styles and mediums 
... It's such pure, 
intense color. " 

- Ron Carlson 

musical jukebox made of neon by 
Guy Marsden. Like Fletchner, 
Marsden has exhibited his work 
throughout California and Ari-
zona. 

Concerned about the future of 
neon art, Lakich began the Mu-
seum of Neon Art in 1981 , the 
only museum of its kind in the 
world . In her book, she recalls the 
factors that led to her decision. 

"I came to the conclusion that 
unless there was a permanent 
place, a museum, to exhibit, doc-
ument , and preserve this an form 
which I felt was synonomou with 
America itself, then my own work 
would be nowhere in 50 or 100 
yea rs," he wrote. 

'" realized that' wa devoting 
my life to the creation of some-
thing that would be totally des-
troyed - never maintained , re-
paired, or exhibited - unless I 
gave some energy toward creating 
that vehicle for its perpetuation."

3's Company Pleases The. Crowd 
by bruna darini 
hiatus staff writer 

"In Ms. Isaac's Tabula Rasa. Denise Dabrowski 
Faith Jensen -Ismay, Terri Shipman, Terry Wilson 
and Ms. McCaleb kept struggling heroically for -
ward to surges of recorded music .. . Ms. Issac's 
Unlitled Duel had equally strong, blustery cho-
reography for Ms. Jensen-Ismay and Ms. Shipman, 
who appeared to be hurled about by a power they 
could not control" wrote the New York Times on 
seeing San Diego's premiere modern dance troupe , 
3's Company, perform on May 6 at the Merce 
Cunningham Studio in New York City. This 
echoes an increasingly popular sentiment about 3 's 
Company. 

The group, consisting of 10 dancers, one musi-
cian, and a general manager has expanded since the 
company was co-founded by Jean Isaacs in 1974 
with just three dancers including herself. Under 
the artistic direction oflsaacs and Nancy McCaleb, 
3's Company has become a 
renowned dance troupe, in-
creasing its budget three times 
within the past year. 

"The response [from New 
York] was very very positive," 
said Isaacs. "People said we 
moved differently than New 
York dancers. W e were more 
physical and looked healthier. 
I'd like for those to be adjec-
tives which describe my work." 

Isaacs, the former dance r and 
current director of 3 's Com-
pany, has studied dance with 
Anne Talbot, Bill Evans, Merce 
Cun ningha m, and Margaret 
Jenkins. She has appeared in 
workshop performances with 
Twyla Tharp, Rudy Perez, Bill 
Evans, and Merce Cunnin~ham . 

Isaacs has choreographed 
pieces for 3's Company, San 
Diego Ballet, California Ballet, 
Choreo 18 of Maryland and George Washington ' 
University and appeared in the KPBS video Take 
J featuring works from her company. H er list of 
achievements continues on and on. 

When asked what her interpretation of modern 
dance was,Isaacs answered "Every day I [ask] that 
question (What is modern dance). Sometimes I 
just say you have to see it. It 's different from one 
person to the next. It's the most of the three 
dance forms that's tied up into a person's person ... 
the person is the dance." 

Isaacs currently teaches modern dance at UCSD, 
as well as at the School of the Performing Arts 
(SCPA) and at her studio downtown. In the past 
she has taught in the UCSD drama department, 
San Diego State's dance program, the Conserva-
tory and USIU. 

"There's so mething about the quality of the 
student here [at UCSD] ... in the intelligence : .. 

that I rea lly love," Isaacs said . 
Similarly, students appreciate the quality of her 

classes both at UCSD and at her 3'5 Company 
Studio downtown. 

.. A lot of choreographers make movement," 
said Melissa Cottle, a participant in Isaacs's mod-
ern dance classes, "but Jean makes art. She 
approaches teaching in the same way as her cho-
reography, giving the essence of what movement is 
about." 

"She's unpredictable. Different in her e nergy 
and movement. Her excitement is contagious." 
Gabrielle Kaufman said, who also dances in Isaacs's 
classes. 

Both Carde and Kaufman are the recipients of 
Summer Intensive Workshop cholarships given 
to students by Isaacs annually. 

Isaacs offers so many opportunities to students 
because as a college student she 
could only participate in dance 
classes twice a week. [t was not 
until after graduating from col-
lege with honors and working 
as a dissatisfied Spanish teacher 
that she realized that dancing 
seriously was what she truly 
desired . 

"If this is what students really 
want to do, they can make it. 
They should go for it and do 
it," Isaacs said. 

According to Isaacs, her pas-
sion for dance began as a child 
coming fro m a large Italian 
family. Dance was a simple, yet 
great way to get attention. 

" When I was a kid at my 
first performance, I thought, 
' Wow! Everyone's looking at 
m e!' .. . it ' s something so 
basic," she said. 

This desire to dance has carried over into her 
immediate family in which both daughters partici-
pate in dance classes. 

Upcoming events for Isaacs include Stage 7 
Dance Theatre's presentation of he r " Mist Leaves 
No Scar" on May 26 and 27 at Ciry College 
theater . Isaacs and her company will hecond ucting 
a summer workshop and performing in Ramona in 
addition to intensive workshops at Isaac's studio 
this summer. 

Both Tabula Rasa and Untitled Duet, cho-
reographed by Isaa s and performed by UCSD stu-
dents on the night of' June 3 in Mandeville 
Auditorium. 

According to Jean Isaacs, "Tabula Rasa" m ea ns 
blank slate, indica ting that each person is a blank 
slate at birth. As life progresses, different factors 
come into one's life filling the slate or shaping the 
person .

Despite the religious overtones, 
their intent is not to force a par· 
ticular view of the world but to 
make music that will bring people 
together. Their lyrics simply re-
flect their backgrounds, says Sai-
lers. 

"I grew up in the church, so I 
had a basic knowledge of biblical 
images. The Bible, just as a piece 
of literature, is such a rich source 
that when you're writing songs it's 
really easy to draw from that if 
you've grown up with that. And 
so many of those images are like 
archetypical images that you don't 
have to be Christian, you don 't 
even have to say that you believe 
in a God to get some beauty out of 
them." 

Judging from the warm, enthu-
siastic reception they received 
Wednesday, they have succeeded 
in creating music that rranscends 
differences in beliefs and reaches 
out to everyone. 

"The master plan is to just take 
everything and put it towards the 
world vision. That's the master 
plan," Ray emphatically stated. 

"Try to make it a better place," 
Sailers added softly. 

"That's what we want every-
body to do. Individual action is 
important. It's what we want to do 
and that's what we're working 
towards. 

"Change the world."

dissertation was approved and he 
became Dr. Sebstian Winston. A 

native Californian, Winston moved 
to New York where he received 
his B.A. and M.A. His interest in 
the bass flute began in 1986 when 
he purchased one for commercial 
reasons. 

His curiosity was heightened 
further when, practicing in his 
studio, he played for Robert 
Erickson, composer and profes-
sor emeritus in the UCSD music 
department. Erickson was in awe 
over the sound. At the time very 
little, if any, composition was 
written for the bass flute. Win-
ston asked Erickson to write 
something and hence his fetish for 
the bass fl ute began. 

Winston's Saturday program 
will spotlight five UCSD compos-
ers. Brian Ferneyhough, also a 
faculty member, will have "Mne-
mosync" (Goddess of Memory) 
performed. Winston speaks of 
Ferneyhough's piece as "such a 
compositional challenge. Every 
time 1 play it, every time, I must 
start at square one." 

Another unique contemporary 
work to be performed is "Terms 
of Temporal Detailing: A Homage 
to David Hockney." Although the 
piece was written for Winston to 
perform, composer Joji Yuasa 
explores the same ideas Hockney 
does in his photo collages. 

Other works include "Chron-
opolis," by grad uate student Frank 
Cox. Winston describes this piece 
as "like a mental city ... each 
movement is like a different crea-
ture." During one movement, the 
piece uses musical devices to fore-
cast and echo movements from 
another. 

" Mutual Intuiting," by Frank 
Pecquet, utilizes two pre-recorded 
bass flutes as well as the one per-
forming live. Pecquet has added 

special effects su h as echo and 
delay to manipulate the sounds of 
recording. Pecquet calls the piece 
"a light fluid composition." 

Another composi tion to use 
pre-recorded material is Chaya 
Czenowin's "Ina." Her piece uses 
six recorded bass flutes . The focus, 
Winston explained, "is the rela-
tionship with the solo (the ani-
mate individual) in relation to the 
voice of many." 

Winston is a busy man. After 
completing his doctoral program, 
he moves to Speranza, a trio he has 
formed that "is on a contempor-
ary level, yet highly artistic." 
Winston also plays each week 
with a group at his church . His 
comment about all the activities in 
his life is that "it's all just music."

rude and rough, I got a really 
sweet guy. I was relieved, but 
admittedly somewhat disap-
pointed. The excitement was gone . 

The Violent Femmes are now 
taking a break in the middle of 
their United States Tour. Delor-
enzo feels the tour is going excep-
tionally well and the band is enjoy-
ing it. They are playing "a good 
mix of material from all four of 
their albums." 

When asked about their change 
in sound over the years, Victor 
Delorenzo replied that ..... for 
the first two records, the material 
had been around for a long tim~, 
we were clearing out old material 
on Hallowed Ground. For the 
econd two records, The Blind 

Leading the Naked and 3, we were 
experimenting more." 

On 3, the band went into the 
studio with only Gordon Gano, 
guitarist and songwriter, having 

. heard any of the songs before. 
Gano explained that, "The first 
time we ever played together was 
in front of an audience, with no 
rehearsal. The fast, quick ideas 
seem to be so right on the mark in 
expressing the songs I write, and 
that's something I wanted to catch 
in the studio." 

Spontaneity is definite! y an essen-
tial element in the Violent Femmes' 
music. They have been getting 
into the groove and letting fans in 
on the excitement for seven years 
now. The trio's origin's date back 
to days spent "busking," in' the 
treets of their hometown, Mil-

waukee, Wisconsin. 

Now when DeLorenzo says, 
"the band functions as a unit, we 
all play an equal part," it's obvious 
he is very serious. We know the 
band as a band and not a singer 
with backup. A very close-knit 
group, they have never changed 
the band's original line-up. 

Although their songs may seem 
fun and stylistically raw, DeLor-
enzo does not joke. The humor in 
the Violent Femmes music is sar-
castic and cutting. They play with 
an aggression and intensity that is 
rare. The music is initially amus-
ing and catchy, but certain ele-
ments sink like rocks. Clearly this 
band is dealing not simply with 
hilarity but with profundity. 

The Violent Femmes are sche-
duled to perform at the California 
Theatre on June 7 at 8 p.m. See a 
live show that makes you think 
and dance simultaneously.

Saturday, June 3. The dance pro-
gram will present An E\lelling of 
Dance as its contribution to the 
two week celebration of the arts. 

The program for Saturday's 
performance will include works 
by dance directors Patricia Rincon 
and Margaret Marshall. One piece 
by Rincon, "Harvest Moon" takes 
a folkloric look at the daily work 
and leisure habits of a community 
of wheat farmers. 

Barry Bernal, the newest faculty 
addition to the physical education 
department, takes his piece 
"Escape" into a different realm. 
The piece uses jazz to address the 
idea of people trapped within the 
dark forces of society. 

Other pieces include "Trilogy," 
a multimedia piece which rakes a 
serious look at growing old. 
"Relax," by Marshall, is a roman-
tic duet inspired by the effects cer-
tain drinks have on relationships. 

An Evening of Dance will pres-
ent eight pieces in all, encompass-
ing modern, jazz, ballet and thearre 
dance. For those who enjoy music 
of heritage, Rincon 's "Pictures 
Without Words" should prove 
satisfying. It is a spicy piece with a 
Latin flair set to music by jazz 
musicians Spyro Gyra. For deep 
intellectuals, "A Tabula Rasa" will 
explore in physical motion the 
concepts 19th Century philoso-
pher John Locke did with words. 

The dancers performing in An 
E\lelling of Dance are all UCSD 
students enrolled in physical edu-
cation dance courses. At last their 
long hours of practice will shine. 
General admission is $7 . Faculty, 
staff and students are $5.

several years. Each court defeat 
for either side was appealed, and 
Walter recalled that at one point 
his case was being heard on five 
separate judicial benches. 

"I had a lot of parents against 
me," Walter said, but added "For 
me to go back to the Soviet Union 
- especially after all those things 
I said - would have been a one-
way ticket to hell." 

"For me to go back to 
the Soviet Union ... 
would have been a one-

-Walter Polovchak 

When asked whether the KGB 
had a hand in the proceedings, 
Walter replied that on one occa-
sion, his lawyer received a threat-
ening phone call. The attorney's 
office was also broken into and 
"Mysteriously, only my files were 
stolen," Walter said. 

Polovchak's legal wrangles 
came to an end in 1985 when, a 
few days after his eighteenth birth-
day, he received his American 
citizenship. 

Polovchak is now working for 
a computer software company in 
Chicago. He claims no particular 
political party affiliation. 

Speaking to a gathering at the 
Libertarian Supper Club of San 
Diego, Polovchak said that he 
particularly appreciates the free-
dom of religion and freedom of 
movement which he feels Ameri-
cans take for granted. ")n the 
Soviet Ukraine, teachers would 
stand around churches and write 
your name down; and the next 
day, when you came to school, 
they would punish you," he said.

ever-so-close to winning. 

The second-ranked Tritons

feated and came out on the wrong 
end of a 1-0 sudden-death over-
time game against William Smith 
College on an extremely windy 
day in New York to close out the 
season 20-1-2. 

The lousy weather and title 
game defeat, however, still could 
not cloud this season of achieve-
ment , as All-American Katy 
Dulock obliterated teammate 
Heather Mauro's single-season 
scoring record with 21 goals - in 
her first year. Mauro, however, 
did not fall far from her previous 
record-setting season, tallying 16 
goals herself. 

Defense dominated all the Tri-
tons' games, as the solid ba.ck line 
helped goalie Julie Freiss collect 
18 shutouts, including two streaks 
of six in a row. Two-time All-
American Susan Kramer led a 
stingy defense that allowed just 
seven goals. The only goal they let 
pass to a Division III school came 
on that fateful day in the middle 
of November. 

A majority of the team returns 
next year, providing an excellent 
opportunity to avenge the long 
loss and to attain the elusive 
No. I spot for the first time. Ever. 

Sophomore All-American Rachel Vetter's play in the National Title 
game helped the Tritons rise up and over the competition.

Triton Swimmers Take 
Second at Nationals 
Men's Swimming 

There was an overa bunda nce 
of talent on the Triton men's ' 
swim team this eason - a 
record 21 swimmers and divers 
qualified for a nationals roster 
limited to 18. However, this 
only helped UCSD, which 
captured second place with 486 
points at the NCAA Division 
111 Championships. 

Though they fell to Kenyon 
(which scored 603.S), the Tri-
tons' second-place finish im-
proved upon last year's third 
place finish. 

Thirteen Tritons earned AIl-
American status in individual 
competition, the most notable 
of those being Brad Thomas 
(1,650, SOO and 200 freestyle), 
Jason Vance (200 backstroke), 
Steve Denys (100 freestyle), 
Derron Frederick (100 breast 
stroke), Shannon Smith (400 
individual medley), Greg 
Good rich ( I 00 backstroke), and 
Dave Sacco (1,650 and 500 
freestyle). 

Other All-Americans inclu-
ded Rich Da niels, Da ve 
Dolotta, Randy Franke, Josh 
Harris, Doug Smith and Jeff 
Vance. 

But Triton swimmers were 

not the only ones singled out 
for honors. Bill Morgan,

Highest Ranking Ever For Men's H20 Polo Tough Year For Men'sHoop 
In a season of bests, the men's 

water polo team did not disap-
point, as they too completed their 
best seaso never. 

Competing against scholarship-
filled Divison I teams, the Tritons 

;finished the season ranked eighth 
in men's open water polo. 

Although eight teams were in-
vited to the National post-season 
tournament, the Tritons were 
excluded. The tournament re-
quired teams from every region of 
the country to be represented. 

Because of this requirement, the 
Tritons were passed over for lesser 
ranked teams from the East. 

Despite the snub, the Tritons 
were able to end their season on a 
positive note, capturing the West-
ern Water Polo Association 
Championshir with a 9-6 win 
over the Air Force Academy. 

The Triton offense was led by 
Jason Brown and David Calder 
while goalie Randy Franke pro-
vided steady defense to lead the 
Tritons.

What'. Oolng On He,e - Nobody on the Triton team knew, but 
they didn't care 24 hours after their record-breaking ordeal began. 
UCSD got itself into the Guinness Book of World Records for the 
longest game of all time.

The Triton bests did not end 
with the termination of their sea-
son. On Sunday, April 15, the 
Tritons surpassed the three-year-
old Guinness World Record for 
the longst water polo game. 

The UCSD record of26 straight 
hours was played over a two day 
period, starting at I : 15 Saturday 
afternoon. 

Fourteen Triton players partic-
ipated in the event, and amassed 
a total of948 goals in the 26-hour 
time period. The fourteen were: 
Larry Sanders, J .P. Beay, Peter 
McConville, Stuart Sweeny, Chris 
Carrillo, Mike Schatz, Jay Hagen, 
Jasbn Brown, Todd Sells, Randy 
Franke, Tom Schatz, Jason

Five Tritons led the way for 
UCSD and were selected to the 
All-American team. lenna Banas-
zek earned this honor for both the 
200- and 500-yard freestyle . Mi-
chelle Steinbergel was chosen for 
the 200 butterfly, Jennifer Wieder 
in the 100 butterfly, Erin Bakey 
for the 200 breast stroke, and 
Joan Macaulay for the lOO-yard 
backstroke. 

See W. SWIM, page 12 

In a game against the Uni-
versity of Redlands this season, 
the Triton men's basketball 
team set a UCSD record - it 
gave up 120 points that night, 
the most any Triton team ever 
gave up. After recording 35 
wins and the two best back-to-
back years in its history, the 
1988-89 Tritons fell apart. 

Though it began the sea-
son with a 2-2 record after the 
Triton Tip-Off Classic, UCSD 
fell to 3-7 over Winter Break 
and was never able to challenge. 
It didn't help the team any that 
Andy Wagstaff and ick 
Capuano, two players who 
were on the roster the previous 
year, decided to quit before the 
season for unverified reasons. 
It helped even less when the 
Triton's only scoring threat, 
sophomore guard Tim Rapp. 
was declared academically in-
eligible for the rest of the season 
when fall grades were released. 

There were a few bright 
spots, however, in the Tritons ' 
troubled 9- f 7 season. The high-
light of the season came when, 
in a game against La Verne, 
Triton captain Scoop Troy 
threw up a hail-mary 58-fOOl 
bomb at the buzzer to beat La 
Verne, 68-66. 

Also on the bright side, 
Gordon McNeill, Rick Batt 
(who set a Triton record with 
16 field goals in a game), and 
Greg Kund , none of whom 
played last season, all emerged 
and had better-than-average 
seasons. All will be returning 
next year, as will Erik Quigley 
and Darvin Jackson who could 
be UCSD stars of the future. 

The Tritons future looks 
much brighter next year. After 
all, they have nowhere to go 
but up.

Eight: Magic Number for 
Muchlmproved W. Hoop 

The catl'80ry is number ' , 
and the answer is: 'The win 
differential between 1988 and 
1989, the number of team and 
individual record accomplish-
ments , and how many players 
are returning for the UCSD 
women's basketball team. . 

"What is eight?" This after-
the-season question was much 
easier to answer than the ones 
posed in November when the 
Tritons kicked off the new sea-
son after finishing 11-14 the 
previous year. 

Any lingering doubts about 
their ability to win, e pecial\y 
in close games, were silenced 
as the senior-led group (with 
five newcomers) posted a 5-2 
record in games with a point 
spread offour or fewer, includ-
ing two claimed in overtime. 
T he Triton team records they 
snap ped were most wins in a 

season, highe t winnin.'l per-
centage (.760), consecutive vic-
tories (nine), and most points 
scored. 

The other half of the eight 
accomplishments were indivi-
dual season and career achieve-
ments by four starters : Tracy 
Ragatz in scoring and assists, 
Jill Koster in rebounding and 
scoring, Beth Koenig in scor-
ing, and Nancy Caparaz in 
assists. 

Seniors Ragatz, Koster, and 
Koenig, who acco unted for 
more than half of the team's 
total scoring, almost half the 
assists , and all but two of 80 
three-pointers, will be sore ly 
missed, Optimistically, though, 
two starters return as do sev-
eral young outside shooters 
and post players who hope to 
earn the regional berth the 
team was denied this season.

The UCSD Guardian 

Cross Country 
Finishes Second 
At Regionals 

obody said that all Triton 
teams had to set stunning new 
precedents in UCSD sports while 
breaking all sorts of records. This 
year's men's and women's cross 
country teams did not produce 
much in the way of mind-boggling 
feats and top national finishers 
- but what's wrong with second 
place finishes for both the men 
and the women at regionals, and 
three Tritons at the national meet? 

Denise McFayden led the wo-
men's squad, which fini hed tied 
with Claremont-Mudd for second 
behind Occidental at the Western 
Regional at Castaic Lake. Mc-
Fayden, who finished second in 
the women's 5,000 meters at re-
gionals to earn a bid to nationals, 
finished 29th at the national meet 
in SI. Louis. 

For the men's team. nothing 
much was broken except maybe 
Roger Webb's heart when he fin-
ished sixt h in the five-mile course 
at the Regionals - one place 
away from a national-qualifying 
berth. However, Merrell Hora 
and teve Fenster finished fourth 
and fifth , respectively, in the 
regional meet to qualify for nation-
als and help the men's team to a 
second place finish, also behind 
Occidental. 

McFayden and Hora, who fin-
ished 62nd at the national meet , 
were selected as MVPs for their 
respective squads this year. 

Another Good Season 
For Triton Fencing 

Triton fencing turned in another 
impressive season in 1988-89, 
despite the fact that only Kathy 
Cox from the women's team made 
it to nationals. Both the women's 
and the men's teams finished 
second in the Southern California 
Fenci ng Conference_ 

Cox, a senior, finished fifth at 
the NCAA Western Regionals 
her junior year, but was denied a 
trip to nationals . This season, 
things were different as she went 
16-4 in regional play in Long 
Beach, finishing first in her div-
ision and earning a trip to nation-
als, For the second year in a row, 
Cox (who ranked 22nd in the 
nation in the Cross-Divisional 
Championship) was selected as 
the tourna ment's outstanding fen-
cer for her athletic performance 
and commendable attitude by 
regional coaches and competitors. 
Cox, who finished second in the 
conference with a 51-5 record, 
was also se lected as the team's 
MVP. 

The men's team also posted 
impressive numbers during the 
season. Men 's foil finished first in 
t he conference. Sabre and Epee 
both finished second . But, West-
ern Regionals came around. John 
Keller, who had qualified for 
nationals the previous year, placed 
six th in the epee at Regionals and 
was nosed out of the nationals 
(the NCAA selected four). In the 
sabre, Avi Friedlich, a first-year 
student with a load of talent, 
placed six th, while Peter Pak and 
Arnon Friedmann placed sixth 
and eighth , respectively, in the 
foil.

Winston's Flute Smokes

hiatus staff writers 

When things are so dark and you wonder why do you get Out of bed, and 
then you realize all :you ha~ in life is hope. 

-Sebastian Winston 

The every day sounds of campus activity create a soft white noise that 
filters in the air arou nd us. We draw steaming coffees to our mouths 
and sip in unison. He lowers his head and draws closer. My own 
reflection bounces off the black of his sunglasses as his mouth forms the 
above quote. 

It seems that for Sebastian Winston, the man behi nd the dark shades, 
music is the hope in his life. Saturday evening, Jun~ 3, Winston will 
share with us the music that is so important to him ina bass fl ute recital.

hiatul luff writer 

No, they're not sisters. In fact, looking at them, you wouldn 't immediately guess that they're friends. Emily 
Sailers sits back relaxed in her chair, looking comfortable and conservative in her gold EMORY sweatshirt, 
Levi 's and spotless white hightops. Next to her, Amy Ray sits on the edge of her chair lighting up her second 
cigarette, restlessly swinging her feet back and forth . She's dressed in a brown polka dot blouse and space blue 
jams, with various members of the Jetson family flying across her legs. The canvas has almost completely come 
away from the rubber toes of her Nikes. Sailers has a Batman button pinned to her sweatshirt, Ray has a 
Navajo cross tatooed on [he inside of he r left forearm, right above the eight friendship bracelets tied to her 
wrist. 

What the Indigo Girls are are two musicians/song writers whose different qualities combine to create some 
great music. 

Despite a lack of airplay on commercial radio, the crowd attending their concert last Wednesday at the 
Bacchanal responded to their music as if they were hometown fa vorites, not an almost unheard of duet our of 
Decatur, Georgia. 

It 's not hard to understand the appeal of their music, but because it does not fit into any kind of 
commercial radio format, it is somewhat surprising that they would be signed by the largest label in the record 
industry. CBS's Epic. If the response Wednesday night can be taken as a sign of future success, then CBS's 
risk is going to payoff big. 

ailers, 25, and Ray, 24, have been singing together for over seven years. They put out a single of their 
own in 1985 and an EP in 1986. In 1987. with the help of John Keen, they produced a full length album, 

[range Fire, also on an independent label (it was through Keen that they got hooked up with REM). They 
already had plans to produce another record when CBS signed them. 

Ray commen ts with a wry mile, " We wanted to make another independent record but no one was 
interested ... 

Since getting signed by a major label and becoming famous was never their goal, they are in a good position 
to continue creating their uncompromising, passionate music. 

"There's no difference as far as the freedom we have mUSically," says Ray. The big change is in how busy 
they are now. " We just get kind of tired sometimes." 

Next to their strength as singers, it is the serious, poetic quality of their lyrics that makes their music 
exceptional. Rich with biblical imagery, they may not be immediately accessible to everyone. Yet when one 
interviewer at the press conference before the concen tried to depict them as saving music from the 
superficiality of pop songs, Ray modestly negated such a lofty depiction of their work. 

"I write because I go through something," explained Ray. "But I think that there's not that big of a difference 
between fast living, drugs and all that stuff and relationships and God. When you're going through one, you 
might turn to the other. 

"I don't think [the themes of pop music] are a separate concern, necessarily . People think of it as separate, 
but I think that there is a way to reach every spectrum of the world. A young person that may just want to 
listen to a Gun's 'n Roses song might really get into what we're doing at the same time because of a basic 

. passion. "

hiatus senior staff writer 
Who are the Violent Femmes? 

Our music has a humorous slant, 
but Irony slips in here and there just 
like In real life. 

What are they like? Judging from 
their music , one would expect 
obnoxious, sarcasti , profound per~ 
sonalities. Victor Delorenzo, drum~ 
mer for the trio, does not fit the 
bill. Over the phone he was 
friendly, accomodating, and even

N xt week will be the AII~ 
Student show in the Mandeville 
Annex Gallery. This will be a 
large, eclectic mix of upper div~ 
ision work in media including 
drawing, painting, sculpture, and 
installation. 

In addition to the artwork in 
formal gallery spaces, numerous 
outdoor installation works will be 
exhibited all over campus. These 
pieces are often the most exciting 
because the artist incorporates the 
environment within their art~ 
work. Some interesti~g works to 
look out for are Sam Frazier's 
Memorial, a work combining 
wood, sod, fertilizer, fake grass, 
and flowers, and dealing with 
society's attitudes about AIDS; 
and Christina Huizar's Like a Leech, 
a wood and cardboard structure 
which addresses i sues of life and 
death in an abstract sense. 

The Media division of the Vis~ 
ual Arts department will be 
represented by two special events 
on campus. Videolmage, a video 
art exhibition, will take place in 
Price Center Conference Room 1 
today and Friday from 3~8 p.m . 
Pop in during that time and watch 
a few of the student videos on 
display. 

On Wednesday, June 7 at 7 
p.m., there will be A Night with 
UCSD Filmmakers. This event, 
held in the Price Center Theater, 
promises to be a provocative, 
exciting demonstration of the 
outer limits of film techniques. 

POETRY 
The Department of Literature 

will hold a poetry reading spot~ 
lighting contemporary work of 
UCSD students and faculty. Fanny 
Howe, one of the newest faculty 
members to join the department 
of literature, will head the event. 
Works by Ruta Poe, Evan Dugan, 
Kathryn Reif, Martha Reid, Erik 
Ulman and others will be read 
aloud by the authors themselves. 
The reading will take place June 7 
in the Revelle Formal Lounge. 

DANCE 
The gra eful leaps and plies of 

ballet as well as the energeti 
motions of jazz will be per~ rmed
