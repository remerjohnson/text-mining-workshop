Commentary 

Li pset as 'Leftist' 
by Richard Nadeau 

Since the end of the sixties, 
many people on the left have 
given up on universitie , arguing 
that the majority of the 
academics in the university 
system have sold out and are 
predominantly concerned with 
the promotion of their own 
lucrative careers and pocket-
books . The assumption un-

IS a link between " reativity" 
and a "leftist inclination," lipset 
ca lled upon his data to prove 
that the most prestigious and 
creative researchers were 
further to the left than " less 
prestigious" researchers . 

Another fundamental part of 
Lipset 's argument was the 
notion that rllost creative i n-
tellectuals are usually " marginal 

Upset holds that AmerlCiln aCildemics 
as a class have a vested interest In 
ma/ntainlnll the status quo. and keepinll 
change within the boundaries of peaceful 
reforms. 
derlying this view is the old folk 
wisdom notion that "a dog with 
a bone in hi s mouth can"not 
bark," -- that is, that American 
academics as a class have a 
vested interest in maintaining 
Ith tatus-quo and keeping 

hange within the boundaries of 
peaceful reforms . 

Speaking Wednesday evening 
befor a capacity crowd of UC 

an DIego tudents and faculty 
members, Dr. Seymore M . lipset 
of Harvard University presented 
a view of academic intellectuals 
that is quite the opposite of the 
one presented above . Wielding 
a weighty sociological magic 
wand composed of an array of 
statistics gathered from a survey 
of 60,000 American academICS, 
lipset argued that American 
intel lectuals are generally on 
the " left," and that those in-
tellectuals who are in the more 
prestigious universities are to 
the " left" of those in less 
prestigious universities . 

He also co ntended that hi 
data I d overwhelmingly to the 
conclusion that the more 
"creative" research oriented-
academ i s are more to the left 
than " teaching" oriented 
academics, and that young 
academics are more to the left 

Lips~t : fun -
damental political problems of 
the industn'aI revolulion have 
bee" solved .... " 
than older academics. 

In explaining his findings, 
lipset argued that there is 
something ihherent in in-
tellectual I ife that pressures 
academics to be innovative, and 

th~t this innovative "thrust of 
mind" is the basis for a rejection 
of the traditional values of 
society. He al50 arlued that 
innovation and creativity are 
hiahly rew.ded in American 
SOCiety, and that this reward 
system pressures academics to 
become hi." Iy competitive in 
the intellectual marketplace. In 
'iupportinl his claim that there 

men" and "outsiders." Adopting 
thi s argument from Thorstein 
Veblen , Lipset contended that 
this explains why the Jewish 
community produces ~ 
"disproportionate" amount of 
superior innovative intellectuals 

. than other groups in society. 

Fi nally , in designating 
America as a "post-i ndustrial " 
society, Lipset claimed that the 
American social system is very 
much dependent upon its in-
tellectual elite for technical 
guidance and ideas, and that 
this need of the system confers a 
high prest ige status upon in-
tell ~tuals . Yet, because in-
tellectuals tend to be inherently 
critical of the status-quo, a 
tension develops between the 
critica l i mpu lses of the i n-
tellectuals and the "systeQ1 's 
managers ." Because of this 
ten ion , Lipset argues, a 
"destabilizing process" is built 
into the system and provides for 
a peacefu l and continuous 
social change. 

Taken as a whole, Lipset's talk 
was a sel f-servi ng and vision-
distorting piece of sociological 
mumbo-jumbo. A slight dose of 
cri tical thinki ng may help us 'ee 
our way through th i verbal 
mog and expose the weed that 

would call itself a rose. 
The first criticism to be made 

is that the concept " left" (as 
well as the concepts "creat ive' 
and " innovative") was freely 
employed without even the 
lightest provision of a formal 

definition . When confronted 
with this problem, lipset evaded 
controversy by maintaining that 
" left" had to be defined "within 
the context of the system." Yet 
this one-dimensional definition 
is itse lf methodologica lly 
prob lematic sinc Lip et's 
survey data (the weaknesse of 
uch attitude surveys is another 

can of worms) only applies to 
academics and not to other 
segments of the "social system." 

When pressea further on this 
matter, Lipset admitted that his 
notion of " left" was an "i n 
systems left ." Thus, for Lipset, 
the Kennedy-type I iberal who 
works for piecemeal reform 
within the system is classified as 
a man of the left. Does not this 
indicate an impoverished 
command of lanluale? Wh.,· 
does Upset insist upon usinl the 
term "leftist" when he means 
"liberal'" Could it be that for a 
Harvard intellectual a 
revolutionary stance that 0p-
poses the system as a whole is 
inconceivable and only a

Errata 
In an article on the Graduate 

Student Council Wednesday, 
the Triton Times ill£orrectly 
reported that the subcommittee 
of the GSC would allocate 
funds, while in truth the GSC 
will make the decisions. The 
subcommittee is gathering 
budget requests. 

In addition, the " tacit un-
derstanding" referred to was on 
the part of the Vending Machine 
Committee and not the GSc. 

Finally , in the Student 
ooperative story, we in-
orrectly spelled Gina Capalbo's 
nd Alex Neddleman's names. 

The Triton Times regrets these 
rrors.

standards. Students who work on 
the project may receive credit in

Rattling Snakes; Not A Radical 
I am wrltmg this letter in response to the 

Malcolm Smith article, " The Mystery of the Rat-
tlesnake, " [Triton Times, Jan . 8]. the contents of 
which were inaccurate, misleading and, at best , 
mane. There are many of us here at UCSD who both 
understand and appreciate that each species, 
whether plant or animal, occupies a special and 
necessary position in the delicate ecosystem in 
which it lives, The rattlesnake does not thrive in 
" orners" and, if confronted, will attempt to flee 
given the opportunity , I encourage Smith to 
continue his "Nature Corner" series but hope that 
he will concentrate on elucidating the many 
marvels and wonders of our Southern California 
wildlife community , What we don't need is the 
perpetration of inaccurate mythologies through the 
medium of shabby Journalistic satire that cau e 

~trong selective pressure for the development of a 
rattleless rattlesnake , 

KENCASSMAN 
In the front page Co-op story on January 22, you 

put Montgomery Reed and myself in the same 
kettle of fish , You said we were two of the Ccrop's 
most radical and outspoken members. As leader of 
the Radical Education Project, Montgomery is all 
too deserving of the title " radical. " But as an active 
member of the Young Americans for Freedom, I can 
in no way be deserving of that label. I am against 
big government and I have a firm belief in and a 
profound respect for individual rights , Please don't 
call me a radical again ,

Where banks offer a maximum of 5
