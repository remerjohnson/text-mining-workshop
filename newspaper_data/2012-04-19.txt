The Department of Justice ended 
its two-year federal investigation 
into racial tensions at UCSD last 
Friday, April 13. University admin-
istrators entered into a voluntary 
settlement with the Justice and 
Education Departments that estab-
lishes an Office for the Prevention 
of Harassment and Discrimination 
to resolve allegations of race-based 
discrimination. The agreement also 
requires mandatory anti-discrimina-
tion training for staff and students.

“Students have a right to seek 
and obtain an education without 
facing racial harassment,” Assistant 
Attorney General for the Civil Rights 
Division for the Department of 
Justice Thomas E. Perez said in an 
April 13 press release. 

The Department of Justice 
launched the investigation into 
UCSD after the racially charged inci-
dents of 2010.

“UCSD, like all colleges and uni-
versities, has an obligation to make 
clear that racial discrimination and 
harassment on campus will not be 
tolerated, and this agreement is a 
significant step in the right direction,” 
Perez said. 

The OPHD declined to comment 
further regarding the provisions of 
the agreement due to the confidential 
nature of the settlement. Although 
the office declined to comment, the 
university released a statement about 
the agreement.

“At UC San Diego, we are pleased 
that our discussions with the U.S. 
Department of Justice have resulted 
in a collaborative agreement that 
recognizes our extensive efforts to 
address harassment and discrimina-
tion, and reinforces a plan for con-
tinued improvements in campus 
climate,” the university wrote in an 
April 13 press release. 

The racially charged incidents in 
question began in February 2010, 
when UCSD fraternity members held 
an off-campus party known as the 
“Compton Cookout.” Outrage over 
the racial climate and the discov-
ery of a noose inside Geisel Library 
culminated in marches and protests

DALAI LAMA 
COMES TO UCSD

BY JAVIER ARMSTRONG

UCSD introduced a new type 
of trash can, called BigBelly 
Solar, on campus this week. The 
Massachusetts-based company 
claims the solar panel-powered 
trash and recycling bins reduce the 
collection frequency by up to 80 
percent.

UCSD Facilities Management 
purchased a total of 25 stations. The 
units consist of one trash compactor 
and one recycling compactor and 
can be found around Library Walk 
and Town Square. 

Assistant Superintendent of 
Facilities Management Alonso 
Noble said this is just the first step 
and that UCSD will purchase more 
solar-powered trash cans.

According to the BigBelly Solar 
website, the trash cans can hold 
about 180 gallons of trash, five times 
the capacity of a traditional 35 gal-
lon trash can. The units also house 
a built-in sensor that alerts main-
tenance workers when it is time to 
empty them. The people responsible 
for pick-up will be notified via a 
website. 

BigBelly personnel are training 
the UCSD Solid Waste Management 

Department staff how to manage 
the units. 

With the new trash cans, UCSD 
is following the lead of cities like 
Chicago, Philadelphia and Boston 
that have already bought into the 
initiative. Harvard and MIT have 
also implemented the trash cans 
onto their campuses.

“We are looking at how it will 
benefit staff, how it will benefit the 
university and how it can attribute 
to the sustainability of the universi-
ty,” Noble said. “With the old system, 
a landscape staff would be assigned 
to drive out to the trash cans to see 
if they needed to be emptied or not.”

Noble said that, with the new 
system, the last shift of the cleaning 
crew can just check the website and 
take care of the units that need to be 
serviced. The saved trips allow those 
on staff to spend their time doing 
other tasks.

The CEO of BigBelly Solar said 
in a Fox Business Network interview 
on Nov. 18 that the cost of each unit 
depends on the system. If a park sys-
tem needs 10 of the trash cans in, the 
cost might be about $1,000 a month 
over a five-year period.

His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama began his panel before a sold-out RIMAC Arena crowd with a joke.
“Usually, when I give a talk, no notes,” 

he said. “No preparation. Main reason: I’m 
lazy.”

SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY

BY AYAN KUSARI
Staff Writer

A research team has built a five-
story building just to tear it down 
and set it on fire. 

The researchers, led by struc-
tural engineering professor Tara 
Hutchinson, will use a giant earth-
quake “shake table” —  a rectan-
gular hydraulic platform designed 
to mimic the shaking motions of 
an earthquake —  to recreate the 
conditions of the 6.7 magnitude 
Northridge quake of 1994. 

The scientists began testing at 
the country’s largest shake table, 
built by UCSD’s Jacobs School of 
Engineering at Scripps Ranch, this 
Tuesday, April 16.  

“What we are doing is the equiv-
alent of giving this whole building 
an EKG,” Hutchinson told the San 
Diego Union-Tribune on April 16. 
“We want to see how it performs 
after an earthquake and a fire.”

The narrow structure, which 
resembles a tower, is designed to 
serve as a model for a variety of 

building types. While the bottom 
three floors have been constructed 
like private homes, the top two have 
been built to function as a realistic 
model of a hospital.

The hospital-like top 
floors of the building have 
been outfitted with a full 
surgical suite, including 
an intensive care unit and 
a working elevator. 

These floors are com-
pletely electrified to 
resemble the conditions 
of a real hospital being 
subjected to an earth-
quake.

Once the building 
has been subjected to the 
full battery of earthquake 
tests, it will be set on fire 
to determine how struc-
tural damage induced by 
these disasters affects the 
spread of fire. 

Because gas and electrical lines 
are frequently broken by seismic 
shaking, fires are a common side 
effect of earthquakes. 

The researchers hope to get a 

better understanding of how fires 
spread in damaged buildings. 

They believe this information 
will help them design buildings that 

are more 
r e s i s t a n t 
to flames 
when broken 
down.

Scientists 
will be able 
to record 
every last 
detail of the 
m o v e m e n t  
as things 
c r u m b l e , 
shatter and 
burn. 

The inte-
rior of the 
building will 
be moni-
tored care-

fully — with over 500 sensors and 
70 cameras —  throughout the test-
ing. 

In addition to simulating the 
Northridge earthquake — one of 
the costliest disasters in California 

history —  researchers also plan to 
model the 7.9 magnitude quake that 
struck Alaska in 2002. 

This earthquake is of particular 
interest because the vibrations of 
Alaskan fault lines tend to resem-
ble the vibrations along the San 
Andreas fault system, which domi-
nates seismic activity in southern 
California.

Finally, the researchers plan to 
recreate the conditions of the 8.8 
earthquake that struck Chile in 
2010. 

 The Chile quake, which occurred 
on Feb. 27,  was one of the largest in 
recorded history. It resulted in over 
500 fatalities and caused a tsunami 
that touched every corner of the 
Pacific rim.

The $5-million project received 
materials and funding from cor-
porate partners, government agen-
cies and the National Science 
Foundation.

Tara Hutchinson was not avail-
able for interview as of press time.

Researchers Develop Shake Table to Mimic Earthquake Conditions

The audience laughed. His off-
the-cuff introduction contrasted with 
the brief speeches given by his co-
panelists, Dr. Richard Somerville and 
Dr. Veerabhadran Ramanathan, both 
professors at the Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography. 

These two professors convened 
with Tibet’s spiritual leader for a dis-
cussion on global climate change. The 
Dalai Lama’s UCSD visit was the first 
in a series of three talks given here, 
at San Diego State University and the 
University of San Diego, collectively 
titled “Compassion Without Borders.”

During the talk, the Dalai Lama 
stressed the necessity of creating insti-
tutional change that would prioritize 
long-term environmental solutions 
over “short-sighted” economic interest.

“Big building, big house, a big car 
and big salary,” he said. “‘That’s the 
meaning of life’ — no, certainly not… 
This blue, small planet is our only 
home. We have to take care of it.”

All three panelists spoke about the 
importance of reacting decisively to 

climate change, enacting environmen-
tal reform and separating politics from 
the global warming conversation.

“Everyone’s entitled to their own 
opinion but not to their own facts,” 
Somerville said. “I think if we de-polit-
icize the debate — you know, there 
aren’t any Republican or Democratic 
thermometers; satellites aren’t liberal 
or conservative — then we could make 
some progress.” 

The Dalai Lama continued his San 
Diego visit with an afternoon stop at 
USD; there is also a panel today at 
San Diego State on ethics. Though the 
Dalai Lama has visited other UC cam-
puses in the past  this was his first time 
speaking in San Diego.

According to UCSD Extension’s 
Director of Information Technology 
Henry DeVries, the event took a good 
deal of coordinating between the Dalai 
Lama’s Personal Peace Emissary, Lama 
Tenzin Dhonden and all three schools.

“The Lama Tenzin approached 
us at UCSD Extension, with the idea 
that the Dalai Lama would welcome 
an invitation to speak in San Diego,” 
DeVries said. “So our chancellor issued 

an invitation… but with the size of 
RIMAC, it would be a shame if only 
4,200 people would get to hear him. So 
we approached the other two universi-
ties to see if they would like to form an 
organizing committee.” 

Between all three universities, 
over 20,000 people attended the Dalai 
Lama’s discussions. At UCSD, all 2,700 
tickets sold out in an hour. At SDSU, 
with 12,000 capacity, the tickets sold 
out in two hours. In the past, the 
Chinese government has protested the 
Dalai Lama’s appearances at American 
venues, stressing that he is considered a 
separatist in political exile. 

The Dalai Lama reinforced the non-
political nature of the talk in a news 
conference before the speech, where 
he explained the meaning of event title 
“Compassion Without Borders.”

“The world belongs to human-
ity, and each country belongs to its 
own people — not religious leaders, 
or kings, or queens, or emperors, or 
political parties,” he said.

involving hundreds, and a teach-in 
that numbered as many as 1,200.

In the aftermath, Chancellor Maye 
Anne Fox and Black Student Union 
co-chairs David Ritcherson and 
Fnann Keflezighi signed an agree-
ment outlining the administration’s 
commitment to improving the cam-
pus climate. The university agreed to 
implement 19 BSU demands, which 
included providing more funding 
for diversity programs and creating 
new positions dedicated to enriching 
diversity.

Since then, university administra-
tors have created the position of Vice 

Chancellor for Education, Diversity 
and Inclusion, hired 12 non-white 
faculty members and instituted a 
diversity requirement for all under-
graduates. 

The university began drafting a 
new code for student conduct in May 
2009 to increase university jurisdic-
tion over off-campus events. The uni-
versity hopes to implement the new 
policy in Fall 2012.

BSU Vice Chair and Vice 
President of External Affairs-elect 
Olamide Noah said that she believes 
that the university has not yet ade-
quately addressed the situation. 
According to Noah, the university 
initially agreed to the terms put 

forth by the BSU, but has since 
put minimal effort in fulfilling and 
implementing the demands.

Most other UC campuses have 
black student resource centers and 
the administrators agreed to provide 
one for the UCSD campus in prin-
ciple, Noah said, but the burden fell 
on the BSU to compile the necessary 
research and put together a proposal.

“Although there have been chang-
es, a lot of those changes were initi-
ated by students. It wasn’t the univer-
sity that took it upon itself to fix this,” 
Noah said.

This week, A.S. Council discussed festivals and official school business. 
Panhellenic Delegate Katey 
Soulzberg announced that a 
member of the Panhellenic Council 
will attend 
council meetings 
from now on. 
Muir Senator 
Elizabeth 
Garcia informed 
council that 
Muir Musical 
“Rent” had been 
a success, but Muir College Council’s 
distribution of $10 coupons for the 
UCSD Bookstore was less fortunate.

“We would say ‘free $10’ and 
people were like, ‘no thanks,’” she 
said. “Really what do we have to 
do?” 

Engineering Senator Parminder 
Sandhu reported that there would be 
a referendum next year to increase 
fees to account for the student bus 
passes.

Associate Vice President of 
Enterprise Operations Brian 
McEuen showed off the new Sun 
God merchandise that goes on sale 
this Monday, including fanny packs 
and some slick sunglasses.

“If you have dirty fingers, don’t 
touch!” McEuen said.

Representatives from The Zone 
presented council with details on the 
Good Life Festival it will be hosting 
on May 3. The festival will feature  
giant hamster balls in water, a rock-
climbing wall and beer goggle race-
carts. Everything is free with a valid 
student ID.

The Student Fee Advisory 
Committee told council about the 
necessity of taking another look at 
student fees. 

“It’s probably the most important 
issue on this campus right now,” 

McEuen, who is also the SFAC 
Chair, said of student fees. “There’s 
not really a lot of fat to trim. But 
we have to continue on, We have to 
supply that number; this is where 
dwindling state support has screwed 

over the students, 
and with decreasing 
revenue streams 
we have to cut 
something.”

Associate 
Vice President of 
Student Services 
Leigh Mason and 

members of the A.S. Safe Rides office 
(Katie Guadagno and Stella Ng) 
spoke to council about the future 
of A.S. Safe Rides. A.S. Safe Rides 
provides students with an emergency 
ride home from 11 p.m. to 2:30 
a.m. Tuesday, Thursday, Friday and 
Saturday, during Weeks One through 
Ten. Mason noted that the growth of 
the Safe Rides program was causing 
it to run over budget by about 
$10,000.

“This service is extremely 
important; we’re seeing this increase 
every year, we have to re-prioritize 
what services are getting money and 
this one is one we should be looking 
at,” A.S. President Alyssa Wing said.

Campuswide Senator Carlos 
Molina led the council in a small 
break by throwing balloons around 
the Forum.

The council unanimously passed 
a resolution opposing the policies of 
the revised Student Conduct Code. 
The council also passed a unanimous 
vote in support of UCSD’s bid to 
host UCSA Congress 2012.

There were high-fives all around 
for last week’s Councilmember of the 
Week, Campuswide Senator Brad 
Segal. This week’s Councilmember 
of the week is Engineering Senator 
Sandhu.

4 THE UCSD GUARDIAN |THURSDAY, APRIL 19,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

Last Friday, as per usual, the Guardian set off to cover the A.S. election results in Price Center East. And while the 
green-, gold- and blue-clad group in front 
of Burger King was every bit as exuberantly 
loud and heartbreakingly depressed as 
election candidates should be, a cursory 
glance around the rest of Price Center 
revealed a markedly different atmosphere. 
The expressions of the majority of students 
that Friday ranged from befuddled, to 
straight-up confused, to obliviously studying. 

Given the generally apathetic expressions 
of the student body, it is no wonder then 
that our election turnout, at a meager 21.6 
percent, hit its lowest point in four years. 
Alyssa Wing’s victory in 2011-12 saw a 
turnout of 27 percent, Wafa Ben Hassine’s, 
22.7 percent (2010-11) and Utsav Gupta’s, 
around 23 percent (2009-10). 

A number of factors led to such a low 
turnout. For one, the general election voting 
came a mere month after the Division-I 
vote, which had seen the staggeringly high 
student response of 51.1 percent. If the 
athletic referendum had been tied in with 
the general election, much like how the 

Canyonview and UCEN referendums were 
tied in with elections in 2011, turnout may 
have been higher. Of course, there was a 
number of factors as to why the Division-I 
vote occurred separately, for one, because 
A.S. Council wanted it to, but the apathetic 
reverberations from such a high voter 
turnout certainly had a negative effect in 
the end. Most students, burned out from the 
intense campaigning for and against Division 
I, had difficulty in creating further interest 
for something that did not seem as dramatic 
or single-issue. 

Another factor that played into election 
turnouts is the mobilization of college 
councils. For the past two elections, 
the candidate with the strongest college 
affiliation (who mobilized large slates with 
names that followed the “verb-the-noun” 
nomenclature and used the color blue) won 
out. This theory, of course, focuses solely 
on President-elect Meggie Le, who often 
cited her experience with Marshall College 
Council, and our current President Alyssa 
Wing, with Warren College. 

The validity of these theories aside, it 
is clear that efforts to reach out to campus 

Voter Tune Out
Low voter turnout may be a result of  political apathy on campus, but certain measures 

should be taken, such as the creation of  a new committee on the A.S. Council.

This week, everyone’s newsfeed is filled with complaints, accolades, 
people complaining about people 
complaining and “I’ll just take 
more drugs” statuses. In other 
words, the Sun God lineup is 
out, everyone is self-righteous 
over the selections and I’m left 
hiding updates from my feed, 
wondering if the exact popularity 
and relevance of the artists really 

matters that much.
Judging by the online debates: 

Yes, it does. Judging by studies 
about the importance of music, 
especially for our demographic: 
Yes, it does. In fact, as far back as 
1989, scientists ran a test to figure 
out the all-important question of 
whether people with societally 
determined “good” music taste are 
more attractive: Yes, they are.

First, it’s important to 
acknowledge that our music 
tastes are a) probably already set, 
and b) will get less and less cool 
over time. A 2008 University 
of Alabama study showed that 
lifelong music preferences stem 
from whatever we listened to 
from 16 to 21 — suggesting that a 
large part of this love stems from 
nostalgia and that 20 years from 
now we’ll get teary-eyed when 
“Talk That Talk” comes on the 
oldies channel. This study is right 
on the money — why yes, I am 
excited about Paul van Dyk, and 
yes, that may have something to 
do with that (perhaps ill-advised) 
phase in high school when I only 
listened to European trance a la 
Darude and Tiësto.

Then, there’s a battery of 
papers about the importance 
of music taste to both personal 
identification and how we perceive 
others. A 2009 Cambridge 
University study determined what 
we’ve all instincti0vely known 
since we began shunning others for 
(still) liking Avril Lavigne in the 
ninth grade: People, especially, as 
the study cites, us “young people,” 
stereotype others based on their 
music tastes. 

More interesting is the research 
that suggests these stereotypes are 
generally true. In 2003, Rentfrow 
and Gosling at the University 
of Texas at Austin evaluated 
undergrads on both their music 
taste and personalities. People 
who like “high-brow” music 
(think classical, blues, jazz) are 
emotionally stable, open to new 
experiences and have above-
average  intelligence and verbal 
abilities. 

Most of the same traits are 
present for those who like rock 
music, except the latter are also 
more athletic (which could due 
to the male-oriented bias in 
these genres). Lovers of top 40 
and rap/hip-hop are not only 
more athletic, they are also more 
agreeable, extroverted and likely to

You’ve probably seen the new solar-powered trash cans that look fresh out of the 
Star Wars droid sale. 

It is easy to assume that the 
new cans are only UCSD’s latest 
accessories to our high-tech, 
environmentally-friendly claim 
to fame, but these receptacles will 
end up being a sustainable money-
saving investment in the long 
run. 

According to Alonso Noble, 
the assistant superintendent of 
Facilities Management, they 
are still gathering information 
regarding the money spent on the 
project, so it is hard to know if the 

BigBelly Solar bins are worth it. 
This information needs to be made 
known to students before we can 
trust that the sustainability of the 
trash cans outweighs the initial 
costs.

But still, this trash can-recycling 
bin combo is an effective solution 
to reducing disposal costs — each 
unit is a solar-powered trash 
compactor that can hold about 180 
gallons of trash, compared to only 
35 gallons that the old trash cans 
held. 

In addition, the units will also 
save maintenance time because 
each one has a built-in sensor that 
detects when bins are full, and 

maintenance is alerted on a website 
to empty the unit. 

By having a compactor within 
in each unit, workers will have 
to empty the receptacles less 
frequently, and less money will be 
spent on the transportation costs 
of dumping the trash because fewer 
trips will be taken to landfills. 

The Massachusetts-based 
company BigBelly Solar, which 
makes the solar bins, claims that 
the collection frequency is reduced 
by up to 80 percent. 

Saving on these maintenance 
fees month after month is a 
smart way to reduce costs and 
the environmental impact of 

transportation. 
When walking by the new trash 

cans, the only major concern is the 
fear of vandalism to the fancy solar 
panels that sit atop the receptacles. 

But these same trash bins are 
found in major cities including 
Chicago, Philadelphia and Boston 
— all of which have reputations 
for crime that just barely beat the 
mean streets of La Jolla. 

Over time it will become more 
apparent if BigBelly Solar bins are 
beneficial, but as a campus moving 
toward sustainability, this looks like 
an innovation that UCSD shouldn’t 
throw out.

New Solar-Powered Trash Cans Are Sustainable Money Investment

THE UCSD GUARDIAN |THURSDAY, APRIL 19,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG 5

constituents can be reformed. Only 
one-fifth of the students at UCSD 
care about who controls a yearly 
budget of $3 million and their Sun 
God lineup, or at least, only one-
fifth cared enough to actually vote. 
Council’s Library Walk campaign 
only targeted a select group of 
students — namely those who 
forgot that election week was in 
full swing and accidentally walked 
through the gauntlet of over-
enthusiastic candidates. 

In order to most effectively 
mobilize the greater college 
campus, a non-biased committee 
within A.S. Council could be 
created, so the work would not 
fall completely on the Advocate 
General. 

Once this committee is created, 
a greater emphasis could be placed 
on targeting students in select 
groups — for instance, in classes. 
A conflict of interest may prevent 
candidates from giving press 
speeches at the beginning of each 
lecture, but the Advocate General 

or the new election committee 
could assign a number of neutral, 
non-returning members of the 
council to go up in the beginning of 
lecture to urge students to vote. 

The committee could also focus 
its efforts on greater publicity 
for the election events that A.S. 
Council currently hosts — the 
presidential and vice presidential 
debates are prime examples. Every 
year, the debates are moderated 
by Guardian staffers, and every 
year, despite our attempts to “mix 
it up” by asking the candidates 
to ask each other questions or by 
allowing public input, nobody pays 
attention except for the candidates 
themselves. 

And though an individual 
focus on specific colleges may 
not be the end-all-be-all of voter 
turnout, it certainly targets a 
specific population (underclassmen 
in certain colleges) and can 
dramatically help a slate out to 
boot. Ride the Tide, with three-
fourths of its executive board 
members as active members of the 

Marshall college community, is a 
prime example. So is the fact that 
two of the very few Student Voice 
victories this year went to Muir 
College Council Senators — after 
all, Muiron Elizabeth Garcia all but 
led the party this year. 

Finally, having larger ballots 
would likely yield larger turnouts. 
Instead of having several special 
elections a year, a larger general 
election with a few hotly-contested 
referendums could positively affect 
voter turnout. Not everybody 
cares about Division I, or the 
Canyonview Pool, or even UCEN, 
but having issues like that on the 
ballot would prompt students who 
actually did care to vote, and most 
importantly, spread the word. 

Low voter turnout is a collective 
action problem that plagues every 
elective process from college 
councils to national elections, but 
effective measures can be taken to 
combat this problem by narrowing 
the focus of election campaigns, 
rather than broadly focusing on the 
entire college campus.

be politially liberal. And finally, in 
another blow to everyone’s love-to-
hate genres, devotees of pop music, 
religious music and, yes, country, 
are agreeable and conscientious and 
generally wealthier — but also have 
low verbal ability and are more 
narrow-minded and politically 
conservative. 

The news is bad for country 
fans in the dating field as well. In 
the aforementioned 1989 paper, 
researchers had undergraduates 
make several dating videos about 
themselves in which everything was 
kept constant except music taste. 
Other undergrads then judged 

the videos and rated the subjects’ 
attractiveness. 

The results showed a correlation 
between music taste and attractive-

ness, though the individual results 
were unremarkable: Men who like 
rock music were more appealing 
(though the same is not true for 
women). 

Women who like classical music 
were more appealing (again, not 
true for the opposite sex). 

Everyone who liked country 
music was less attractive (the 
exception, of course, being our own 
Opinion Editor Madeline Mann, 
who essentially out-Taylor Swifts 
Taylor Swift).

In conclusion, science confirms 
everything we secretly thought was 
true. Music is important. It defines 
us. Don’t listen to country.

Dear Editor,
The registered student 

organization “Awareness and Action 
for Autism” is having a benefit 
concert at the Loft, in a week, with 
the proceeds going to an organization 
called NFAR. This event has a 
Facebook event, with a wall where 
participants can post. 

I posted the following comment: 
“While some of NFAR’s programs 
are beneficial, the language they 
use to describe autism encourages 
unjustified fear and dehumanization 
of autistic people. Citations and 
additional explanation provided upon 
request.” They deleted it, with no 
explanation or justification. Three 
times. And they have refused to even 
admit, in public, that they did so. This 
is clearly not the behavior of a group 
interested in open, honest dialogue, or 
apparently, any dialogue at all. Such 
high-handed refusal to engage with 
criticism is not acceptable behavior for 
a UCSD student organization.

Dear Editor,
The April 9 article entitled, 

“Study: UC Education Is Too Leftist” 
refers to a recently published study 
by the California Association of 
Scholars which claims, in almost 
conspiratorial terms, that the UC 
system’s curriculum is leading our 
students down a liberal social science 
path, shepherded by mostly liberal 
professors who are, drum roll, 
Democrats. Scratch the surface and 

you’ll find that this group is led by 
Ward Connerly, a former UC Regent 
who made it his personal crusade to 
destroy affirmative action, and is part 
of a larger organization called the 
National Association of Scholars. 

If you play around on the NAS 
website for just a few minutes it’s 
easy to unveil this group’s real goal: 
bringing the conservative agenda 
to college campuses to target multi-
culturalism, affirmative action and 
further the ultimate agenda of a “free 
market”-based society.  As always, 
FOLLOW THE MONEY.  

The NAS is funded by such 
conservative heavyweights as:  Sarah 
Scaife Foundation, Koch Foundation 
and the John Olin Foundation.  The 
article cites an education-focused 
website, “Minding The Campus,” 
which loosely claims that students 
have complained about their too-
radical professors.  

Keep in mind that “Minding The 
Campus” is a subset of the Manhattan 
Institute, a conservative think 
tank that relishes the supply-side 
economics paradigm of deprivation 
for most and riches for a few.  This 
study is not a case of unbiased 
research and the Guardian should 
have done a little of its own to bring 
its readers a truer picture of the 
backstory behind this “study.”

6 THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  THURSDAY, APRIL 19,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

I was born two years shy of the 1980s, but I’m just as stuck in the decade as any alcoholic Van Halen 
obsessive. Here’s why: For the entire 

month of April, a few of my friends 
and I have challenged ourselves to lis-
ten to only music made in the 1980s. 

The rules are simple: Exceptions 
can be made for live shows and when 
we don’t have control over the music 
playing, but any time we make the 
conscious effort to listen to music, it 
has to be from the ’80s.  

You might be wondering what 
the appeal of such a silly challenge is, 
apart from the fact that it’s a challenge. 
It’s simple, really; having constraints to 
your music-listening means you even-
tually have to dig a lot deeper, making 
’80s April an enriching experience. 

So far, I’ve discovered how great 
New Zealand indie-rock was, down-
loaded the entire discography of cult 
indie-rockers Felt, made early house 
music my new cooking soundtrack 
(I gotta dance while I drain noodles, 
guys) and began belting out the 
Smiths more often than usual in my 
car. For months I felt stuck in a musi-
cal rut, with little to no desire to go 
digging for new music, but now I find 
myself constantly asking my friends 
about their new ’80s discoveries and 
scouting blogs for unknown treasures. 

My hunt for the obscure received 
a slight knock in credibility, though, 
when the New York Times published a 
column by Alexandra Molotkow titled 
“Why the Old-School Music Snob Is 
the Least Cool Kid on Twitter.” 

Molotkow’s point was this: “There 
is no longer any honor in musical 
obscurity.” Apparently, the rise of 
social media has made little-known 
music even more irrelevant; instead, 
she argues, the more people like 
something, the more valuable it is. 

Now, let’s forget the idea that 
“value” in terms of music is subjective, 
but get to the root of the problem: 
Molotkow’s point isn’t unique. I’ve 
noticed an upswing in once-hipsters 
deciding that they’re now too cool to 
actually care about discovering music. 
They look down on those still excited 
by the prospect of a great new band, 
scoffing on their high horse while 
ironically (though they’d argue it’s 
authentically) listening to more “pop-
ulist” acts (whatever that means). 

While I, too, relish the fall of 
music elitism caused by the Internet, 
a taste for the obscure does not equate 
to snobbery. There’s a difference 
between happening upon an excellent 
band that hasn’t made it big yet and 
actively seeking out such acts only 
because they’re obscure. Good music 
is good music, and I don’t understand 
why there’s this sudden aversion to the 
music nerdery I love so dearly. 

Molotkow would probably mock 
my ’80s April jaunt, instead suggesting 
that I let the populist speak for itself 
and watch while artists like Azealia 
Banks rise through the ranks of 
YouTube. And I’ll do that. But I’ll also 
continue to hunt through record bins, 
because good music lives there too.

Now, back to the ’80s.

Digging 
Deep ‘Aint 
Snobbery; 
It’s Just Fun

Combining delicate harp harmonies with dense electronic textures and a sense of melody borrowed from contemporary 
R&B, Active Child’s Pat Grossi makes 
music that sounds both otherworldly 
and corporeal. Next �ursday, Active 
Child will play at �e Lo� at UCSD. 

Grossi took the time to talk with the 
Guardian over the phone Wednesday, 
discussing R&B, pop music’s past and 
the di�culties of playing his delicate 
pop music live.

�e combination of harp and 
electronic beats is certainly an unusual 
one. “Originally I was doing both 
separately, and suddenly I realized 

‘wow, maybe I should just try to 
put these two things together to get 
something really interesting,” Grossi 
said. “I would listen to the electronic 
stu� and feel like it was missing 
something a little more tangible, there 
was something just out of reach. I 
couldn’t really connect with a lot of it, 
and as soon as I started playing harp 
on top of it, it started to feel like much 
more engaging music.” 

However, making the transition 
between this intricate approach to 
production and the o�en-unsteady 
realm of live performance has proven to 
be tough. “It was di�cult,” Grossi said. 
“We’ve been touring pretty much non-

stop since the album came out. 
I think the songs are changing and 

we’re playing them a little bit better 
each tour. We’ve �gured out how to 
break down a lot of the orchestration 
and make it happen live.”

As though his approach wasn’t 
inventive enough, Active Child’s debut 
album, last year’s You Are All I See, 
saw the band �irting with the kind of 
buoyant pop melodies one might �nd 
on a Beyonce track. Grossi attributes 
this shi� to increased vocal skills. “I 
feel like I found myself moving more 
and more in that direction the more

TRITONES SEVENTH ANNUAL BALLROOM SHOW
PRICE CENTER BALLROOM / APRIL 21, 8 P.M. / FREE

In celebration of their 15-year anniversary, the Seventh Annual A Cappella 
Ballroom Show will be hosted by UCSD’s own Tritones this Saturday night. 
The show will feature performances from southern California’s finest college 
a cappella, with groups representing UCLA, UC Irvine, Point Loma Nazarene, 
Cal State Northridge and of course, UCSD. Proceeds go to the Tritones’ 
upcoming album, set for release this fall. (RE)

WAVVES
PORTER’S PUB / APRIL 25, 8 P.M. / FREE

Born from the drab suburban sprawls 
of southern California, Wavves is 
the brainchild of San Diego slacker 
Nathan Williams. The band’s brand 
of bratty, lo-fi pop-rock has gained 
steady acclaim from the indie rock 
community. Williams has made 
a virtue of not taking music too 
seriously, with his silly fuck-you 
anthems becoming a staple of 
outdoor music festivals and college 
venues. Rising local innovators 
Cuckoo Chaos and TV Girl are set to 
open. (RE)

con�dent 
I became with my voice, Grossi 

said. “It’s more fun for me as a 
singer, and I think it carries a lot 
more soul and a lot more melodic 
diversity. �ere’s just a lot more 
�ow to the voice and �ow to the 
melodies.” Grossi is also inspired 
by the way pop music has evolved 
over time, �nding the ‘80s to be a 
particularly motivating time.

“I think naturally when you 
write a song, you’re drawn to 
certain aspects of old music that 
you listen to,” he said. “I’ve always 
been really into the sound of the 
‘80s -- gated drums, toms and 
lots of reverb. I like a lot of the 
synthesizers from that time period 
as well, the classic analog pads 
and synths. I think that to not 
be in�uenced by some musical 
creation is pretty much impossible.”

Last time Active Child played at 
UCSD was in late 2010, supporting 
School of Seven Bells. Grossi is 
excited about the progress the 
band’s made since that show.

“We’re obviously touring a lot 
more and becoming a stronger 
band,” Grossi said. “We’ve also 
added a drummer and percussionist 
to the group who’s been playing a 
mixture of live drum kit and a full 
electronic kit, so he’s back there 
doing a lot of work, helping the 
songs come to life. It should be a 
much more engaging show than 
when we played there last.” 

�e development of Active 
Child’s live setup isn’t limited to 
the musical, either: “It should 
be a pretty all-encapsulating 
performance where you hopefully 
feel lost in the music,” he said. 
“We’ve added a lot of lighting, 
lasers, smoke and things that will 
help enhance the mood. It should 
be pretty powerful, hopefully.”

MOVIE REVIEW

Chimp Off  the 
Old Block
Family nature ‘documentary’ injects chimp 
footage with sentimental Disney magic. 
Brana Vlasic • Contributing Writer

J ust in time for this week-end’s Earth Day, Disney’s 
“Chimpanzee” aims to provide 

an environmental, family-friendly 
romp that’s light on gritty, real-
life documentation and heavy on 
Hollywood sentimentalism and a 
whole lot of 
cute and cuddly 
chimps. 

Narrated by 
Tim Allen and 
co-produced by 
Disneynature 
(2007’s “Earth” and last year’s 
“African Cats”) and the Jane Goodall 
Institute, the movie transports audi-
ences to the forests of the Ivory 
Coast in the heart of Africa. With 
sweeping establishing shots of dense 
jungle canopies, we swing from 
tree to tree to Alastair Fothergill’s 
delightful conga/jazz score reminis-
cent of Louis Prima’s “Jungle Book” 
soundtrack. 

From here, the film narrows 
in on a tribe of chimpanzees, and 
we’re introduced to our unwitting 
protagonist, a baby chimp named 
Oscar. The traditional Disney nar-
rative then kicks into full gear when 
Oscar’s mother is killed by a rival 
clan of chimps, led by a vicious look-
ing chimp who we are told is named 
Scar (of course). Oscar is secluded 
from the rest of his community and 
his chance of survival seems slim 
until he is unexpectedly adopted by 
one of the wisest, alpha male mem-
bers of the clan, Freddy.  

The patient filmmakers man-
age to capture moments of Freddy’s 
remarkable nurturing side, as well as 
his defensive animal instincts, pro-
viding ample opportunity for direc-
tors Fothergill and Mark Linfield to 
develop the chimps’ relationship on-
screen. Freddy teaches Oscar how to 
dig for ants, crack open honeycombs 
and sniff out the ripest nut. It’s ador-
able, sure, but it’s equally fascinating 
to watch the animals’ daily routine 
at such an intimate proximity — 
whether or not Tim Allen’s heavy-
handed narration is distracting from 
the realism. 

And, as expected from the target 
audience of “Chimpanzee,” realism 
isn’t the film’s goal. For example, the 

scene in which Freddy and Oscar 
hunt for the tasty red colobus mon-
keys, they conveniently omit any 
gruesome footage of our lovable ape 
heroes feasting upon their cousin 
specie. 

But “Chimpanzee” is undeniably 
gorgeous. The footage of untouched 
scenery reveals the hidden beauty 
of our planet — a certain goal of the 
Jane Goodall Institute, which is set 
to receive 20 cents for each movie 
ticket sold in order to support its 
goal of educating the public about 
wildlife preservation. 

“There might be easier ways 
to make a living, but none are this 
fun,” says one of the film’s featured 
researchers during the closing cred-
its. It’s an inspiring message for a 
young audience whose dreams may 
lie beyond a nine-to-five cubicle job, 
and for “Chimpanzee”’s few modest 
goals, that’s a solid achievement.

ALBUM REVIEW

A fter Bay Area garage revivalist Ty Segall got more introspective and a lot less fuzzy on last year’s excellent Goodbye Bread, Hair, his 
eight-song LP with White Fence (aka Tim Presley) 
finds him back at the distorted, jam-based garage 
sound he’s become synonymous with. Tim Presley, 
also of the bands Darker My Love and Strange 
Boys, brings his bratty lo-fi persona White Fence 
to the table, resulting in a solid, psychedelic rock ‘n 
roll album.

Recorded exclusively at Bauer Mansion, a studio 
in SF’s Chinatown, Hair begins with “Time,” a song 

whose long introduction includes clashing cymbals, a deep, chanting voice, dirty 
garage guitar feedback and almost pastoral acoustic strumming, eventually trans-
forming into fuzzy, distorted vocals over loud, gritty rock ‘n’ roll.

“I Am Not A Game,” the album’s first single, is an organ-driven track that begins 
as an upbeat, fun, dancey tune and ends with a double time, freakishly psychedelic 
jam. “Easy Rider,” borrowing the name from the ’69 classic counterculture Dennis 
Hopper film, has a simple and easy-going tempo, its tambourine and snare paired 
with breezy surf guitar chords, and allows the vocals to dominate, making it easily 
Hair’s best song.

The album as a whole is less than 30 minutes, giving the album a more cohesive 
feel and leaving the listener wishing there was more. In a crowd of faceless garage 
rock acts, Ty Segall & White Fence stick out like redheaded afros. Although both 
are said to have new solo works in the making, with an album this good, hopefully 
another collaboration will be in the future.

D rugs and Spiritualized have always gone hand in hand, although main man 
Jason Pierce’s exposure to restric-
tive experimental medicines to 
treat his recent liver disease and 
double bout of pneumonia means 
that Sweet Heart Sweet Light was 
composed under the influence of 
a wholly different set of narcotics 
to which he has traditionally been 
associated. 

His band’s latest effort is 
Pierce’s attempt to make sense of 
life following his emergence from 
an exhausting, and apparently 
enlightening, recovery process.

Sonically, the record rarely 
strays from the conventional 
Spiritualized cocktail: classic blues, 
Krautrock rhythms, ecstatic gospel 
with conventional rock and roll 
arrangements and richly layered 
soundscapes. 

As demonstrated on strong 
lead single “Hey Jane,” Sweet Light 
features many lengthy songs that 
are gradually built up by melodic 
guitar riffs and attractive piano 
melodies broken down and then 
tentatively reconstructed into 
euphoric, orchestra-led climaxes. 

Pierce’s meticulous perfection-
ism at the mixing desk means the 
record retains melody, avoiding 
disintegration into a confusing 
cacophony of noise. 

The album is also one of the 
band’s more accessible efforts to 
date, with much of the epic lay-
ers of fuzz and guitar distortion 
common throughout its earlier 
work neglected in favor of more 
accessible melodies and prominent 
vocals. 

Unfortunately, here Pierce’s 

limited capabilities as a singer are 
further undermined by lyrics that 
are often repetitive, stereotypical 
and unintentionally amusing, load-
ed with predictable references to 
Jesus, Mary, getting to heaven and 
“holding on.” “Don’t play with fire 
and you’ll never get burned,” for 
example, sounds like another tired 
line uttered innumerable times 
across the band’s seven albums.

Though he remains over-
whelmingly concerned with the 
same melodramatic issues, the 
album features several moments of 
clarity and optimism. 

High-point “I Am What I Am” 
is a reassuring proclamation of 
self-peace, while the soaring chant 
of “So Long You Pretty Thing,” 
backed by triumphant strings and 
a powerful choir conclusion, ends 
the record on an enduring note. 

It is with this new backbone 
of positivity that Pierce narrowly 
avoids colorless redundancy.

10 THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  THURSDAY, APRIL 19,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

Ryan Goodbrand 7–0 was credited 
with the win, throwing seven innings 
and allowing just four hits.

GAME 2
The next game of the series was 

scheduled to be played the following 
day, but was rescheduled due to 
inclement weather. “Sometimes it’s 
tough, being on the field and not 
knowing if you’re going to play or not 
that day,” LaFace said. “But you just 
have to come in with the mindset that 
you’re going to have a game that day, 
and everyone’s just gotta play hard, 
regardless of the weather, because you 
never know.”

UCSD took a big 14–2 win, as 
Susdorf doubled, tripled twice and 
recorded three RBI in the second 
game. The bats were hot across the 
roster as shortstop Garrett Tuck 
recorded three hits on three runs, while 
Frazier chipped in two RBI. wSenior 
righthander Jeff Rauh recorded the 
win, relieving senior Greg Selarz in 
the fifth inning. Rauh recorded three 
strikeouts, while allowing only one hit 
in his three innings.

GAME 3
UCSD’s only loss came in the 

second game of the day, where they fell 
to the Toros 1–0. The Toros capitalized 
on a Triton error in the bottom of 
the first inning to go up 1–0. But the 
Tritons were unable to get the bats 
going to close the gap. 

“It was tough getting shut out in 
that game,” LaFace said. “I think guys 
came with the mindset that we had to 
make a change in our approach and 
just try and be more aggressive and put 
the ball in play as opposed to just being 
passive and waiting for something to 
happen.”

GAME 4

UCSD ended the series with a big 
16–5 game last Tuesday, April 17 at 
Triton Baseball field. The Toros took 
an early two run lead in the first inning, 
but the Tritons recovered in their turn 
at-bat. UCSD went up 5–2, off a three 
run homerun from sophomore Scott 
Liske.  The Tritons kept the bats hot 
throughout the match, as sophomore 
Nick LaFace went 4-for-4, while first 
baseman junior Richard Siegel went 

3-for-4, recording four runs.  Triton 
southpaw junior Richard Kilbury 3–0 
— the junior has picked up three wins 
in his past three games — allowed just 
two hits in his 2.2 innings. 

“It was kind of a sloppy game on 
both ends, there were some things that 

we had to clean up defensively. It was 
just one of those games where different 
things happened, but I’m glad that we 
ended up on the winning side of it.”

ruda@ucsd.edu

The only other team to come 
out of the tournament unscathed 
was Division-I San Jose State. 
The Tritons will have this week to 
prepare for a non-conference bout 
against San Diego State, this Friday, 
April 20, before they head into the 
postseason. 

UCSD will look to replicate its 
results from last season, where the 
second-seeded Tritons upset first 
seed Loyola-Marymount 11–13 in 

the conference tournament. This 
season, UCSD will host the WWPA 
tournament.

“We have really been focusing on 
the counter attack and our power 
play defense,” Kreutzkamp said. “I 
thought that in both of those areas 
we are showing huge improvements. 
Our play is the best; it’s been all 
season and hopefully we are peaking 
at the right time.”

Triton to take wins in both the singles 
component and doubles component.

The pair of Jiganti and Ling downed 
Abilene Christian’s Guilherme Gesser 
and Michael Morris 8–5 in the No. 3 
doubles bout. The Tritons fell in the 
No. 1 and No. 2 doubles matches. 

Down 2–1, the Tritons could 
only manage two wins in the singles 
competition. 

Jiganti won the No. 2 singles 
match against the Wildcats’ Nick 
Plum, with scores of 6–1, 1–6 and 
6–4. Sophomore Devon Sousa pulled 
through for the Tritons, playing in 
the No. 6 singles position, defeating 
Michael Morris with scores of 6–2, 
2–6 and 6–3. 

The Triton women did not fare 
any better, falling 1–8 to the No. 6 
Wildcats. 

UCSD went without winning a 
single set in the singles competition. 
The only match the Tritons were able 
to take was in the No. 3 doubles 
match, between junior Katie Mulloy 
and sophomore Laura Wilke. Mulloy 
and Wilke took their match 8–4 
against Abilene Christian’s Jaclyn 
Walker and Emily Conrad. 

“[Abilene Christian’s] ranked 
seventh in the country, and we 
actually played pretty well against 
them,” UCSD head coach Liz Laplante 
said. “We weren’t really going into the 
match necessarily looking to win, but 
to just hopefully win some matches.”

The following day, Monday, April 
16, the No. 21 Tritons conceded 
another loss, this time to unranked 
Concordia. 

Mulloy and Wilke came through 
again in the No. 3 doubles match, 
taking an 8–2 win against Concordia’s 
Ellie Johnson and Ulrike Hahn. 

However, the No. 1 doubles pair of 
junior Melissa Breisacher and senior 

Jacquelyn Davis fell 8–4, while UCSD’s 
No. 2 doubles team of freshman 
Melinda Chu and sophomore Tara 
Vanooteghem dropped their match 
8–5.

The Tritons managed to take 
two wins in the singles competition, 
with Vanooteghem winning the No. 
3 match 6–4 and 6–2 and Mulloy 
cementing the No. 4 win with scores 
of 6–3 and 6–0. 

“It was a great day for [Mulloy]. 
She’s a senior, she’s always got three or 
four injuries at a time, and she played 
a great match to win that singles 
battle.”

Both the men’s and women’s 

teams will return to competition this 
Friday, April 20. The men will stay in 
Southern California, where they will 
face Point Loma on the road. 

The women will travel up to 
Turlock, where the Tritons will face 
off against the Warriors for the second 
time in two weeks.

“We haven’t had a great year as far 
as our wins and losses go, but we’ve 
really improved a lot,” Laplante said. 
“We’re just hoping to end the season 
with two or three wins, and build 
from there for next season.”

UCSD Prepares for Conference 
Tournament.
BY RACHEL UDA
Sports Editor

MEN’S GOLF — The UCSD Men’s 
Golf team placed 11th in a field of 
20 schools last Monday and Tuesday, 
April 18 and 19 at the 39th Annual 
Hanny Stanislaus Invitational in 
Turlock, California.

The Tritons came into the 
tournament after placing second 
out of 11 schools in the beginning 
of April at the FLC Skyhawk Desert 
Shootout.

“The fact that we did place 
second the other day shows that we 
actually have the potential to show 
well at Regionals,” UCSD assistant 
coach Keith Okasaki said.  

In the first day of competition, 
sophomore Simon Lewis and 
freshman Jay Lim led UCSD on the 
green. Both Tritons finished five 
over par, with scores of 149. The 
two ended the first day tied for 34th 
place overall. 

Sophomores Jacob Williams 
and Fredrik Palmer-Picard both 
recorded decent performances, 
carding scores of 153 and 155, 
respectively.

The Tritons ended the day 
placed 13th, chasing first-place 
No. 4 nationally ranked Cal State 
Stanislaus and second-place No. 7 
Western Washington.

The Tritons had a good second 
day to jump up two spots, finishing 
11th with a score of 902. UCSD 
finished 38 over par, nine strokes 
behind 10th place Dixie State. 

Simon held his stroke to lead the 
Tritons with a score of 222 on the 
par-72 course. Lim finished three 
strokes behind, while Williams and 
Picard carded scores of 74 and 75 
respectively.

“[Simon] played better than his 
score indicated,” Okasaki said. “It 
was really windy on Monday, and 
the conditions made it hard for 
everyone out there. [Lim] played 
a solid round, it wasn’t his best 
performance but we just finished a 
practice round today, and it went 
pretty well. So we should have a 
pretty good showing at conference.”

Hosts Cal State Stanislaus kept 
its first day’s advantage to win the 
tournament for the 14th time in 
the past 17 years, while Western 
Washington finished in second. 

The Tritons now have the rest 
of the week to prepare for the 
CCAA Championships, to be played 
on April 23-24 in Paso Robles, 
California, where UCSD will look 
to improve on 2011’s sixth-place 
finish.

Coming off a loss to unranked Cal Baptist the weekend prior, the No. 19 Tritons 
have rebounded beautifully, going 
4–0 at the Santa Clara Invitational 
last Saturday-Sunday, April 14 to 

April 15.
The four wins secured the 

second seed for the Tritons, who sit 
two games behind first place Loyola 
Marymount and four games in front 
of third place CSU East Bay.

The tournament, hosted by 
Santa Clara University, pitted nine 
Western Water Polo Association 
squads against each other, serving as 
a proving ground for the conference 
tournament, to take place in just 
two weeks. 

On Friday, in their opening 

match, the Tritons took on 17–11 Cal 
State East Bay. The game remained 
close in the first two periods, as 
the Pioneers kept within one goal 
of the Tritons. But UCSD pulled 
away in the third quarter, outscoring 
CSU East Bay 3-0, riding their 
momentum to take a comfortable 
9–3 win against the Pioneers, who 

sit right behind the Tritons in the 
conference standings.

Against the Pioneers, the scoring 
was spread across the roster. 

Sophomore utilities Leah 
Gonzales and Sarah Lizotte each 
netted two goals apiece. The 
Tritons also saw contributions 
from consistent goal scorers senior 
attacker Jessica Tran and senior 
center Kirsten Bates. 

“I thought that both Kirsten 
Bates and [senior driver] Katherine 
Biehle had a fantastic tournament,” 

UCSD head coach Brad Kreutzkamp 
said in an email interview. “[Biehle’s] 
counter attack skills have helped the 
team all year and have particularly 
helped us as of late.”

In their second game of the day, 
the Tritons fought for a closer 12–8 
win against CSU Monterey Bay, who 
is just 6–7 in conference.

Bates led the Tritons in the 
attack, tallying four goals, while 
Lizotte, Biehle and center Melissa 
Bartow each tacked on two goals 
apiece. 

On Sunday, April 15, the Tritons 
faced bottom of the conference CSU 
San Bernardino, who have lost all 
14 of their WWPA matches thus far. 
UCSD strolled to a 26–5 win against 
the Coyotes, before taking down 
Division I CSU Bakersfield 12–7.

BASEBALL — The Tritons moved 
back into the national rankings this 
week after taking three of their four 
games against CSU Dominguez Hills.

The Tritons — who sit at the top of 
the CCAA standings — have two more 
conference series before postseason 
play. 

The first will be a home-and-away 
series against CSU San Bernardino, 
beginning this Thursday, April 19 
at San Bernardino. UCSD will end 
CCAA play with another home-
and-away series against CSU Los 
Angeles, and will close out the regular 
season against Grand Canyon in the 
beginning of May.

GAME 1
No. 29 UCSD took a tight 3–1 

win against the Toros last Thursday, 
April 12. 

The Tritons scored all of their 
three runs in the bottom of the second 
inning, when freshman Brett Levy 
doubled down the leftfied line. Levy 
advanced to third on an error, and 
was brought home by junior second 
baseman Spencer Frazier.     With 
just one out, sophomore Danny 
Susdorf doubled to load the bases. 
Frazier and junior Sam Michaels scored 
off a sacrifice fly. The Toros recovered 
one run in the fourth inning, but were 
unable to close the deficit. Triton ace
