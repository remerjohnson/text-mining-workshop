Muir night watchman enJoys 
'meeting, talking with students' 

Ko"'y IC/uz.' 
"Students are not conscientious enough about protectinJ/ 

their personal possessions." says Bill Vecera . Muir college 
nillht watchman. "They leave out expensive typewriters and 
guitars. and forllet to lock up their rooms and refrigerators. 
This is just askinll for trouble ... 

Vecera can be found Tuesday through Saturday nillhts. 
strollinJ/ throullh the Muir dorms and apartments. His job is 
not to be confused with that of the campus police. however. he 
is here solely to prevent crime. If he should come acro.s a 
burillar or a vandal. in the Clct he reports him. but does not 
apprehend him. 

One of the problems that Vecera deals with is that of 
transients Clnd non-students who sleep in the 10unJ/es and halls 
of the dorms. He simpl~' asks them te} leave. and if they refuse 
to do so. he calls the campus police. 

Another major duty of the nillht watchman is to assure that 
students ' belonllinJ/s are not stolen: especially those that are 
left out overnillht or lei t unlocked. In case an incident arises. 
Vecrera is equipped with a walkie-talkie which puts him in 
touch with both Cleo Malone. Muir resident dean. and the 
campus police. . 

Most Unusual Experience 
Vecera 's most unusual experience as nillht watchman was 

earlv one morninll when he observed two boys breakin/Z into 
one 01 the Muir Clpartments. He contacted the campus police 
and then went over to stop the two. It turned out. however. that 
the v lived in the apartment. and hCld just locked themselves 
oul. 

Vecera lists as his QualificCitions for the nij!ht watchman 's 
job as his past experience in the militarv intellil!ence. and his 
ellpertise in judo. He tauj!ht judo at a GI constabulary school in 
Germany at the end of World War II. and served in the 18th Air 
Corps Intelligence during the war. He still feels confident that 
he could handle anyone who came at him with a weapon. 

" Freedom of thou/Zht and the opportunity to meet and talk 
with students are two main advantaj!es of this job." says 
Vecera.

Com. Board cuts T.T., KSDT 
The CommunicCitions Board voted late Monday to slash the 

TRITO:\ TIMES operatinlZ budget to a h~ve l below that of last 
year . The Comm Board mandated that. among other things . 
salaries must be cut. I::ditor-in - chief ~Iollv Selyin said the 
cuts. if allowed to stand : will " force several kev stan members 
to resilZn. and the paper will be hard-we sed 'to find qualified 
replacemen ts ... 

The Communications BOCird is a chancellor 's advisorv 
committee. which as owner 01 the various media . i's 
responsible lor thc publication of the TRITO:\ T1MI::S and the 
supervision of radiO stCltion KSDT Clnd the subsidiar~' journCils. 
The ;\londa\' mel,tinll WClS called to determine allocCitions of 
lunds lor the various ml'dia this \"ear. 

Actin/Z Communications 80Clrd chairmCin Mike Weiss called 
the board into "executive" sessliJO. In a stCi tement to the 
THITO:\ TIMI::S Weiss said he tailed the dosed meetin/! 
because he lelt previous meet in/!s to discuss bud/Zet allocations 
had been "chaotic" since non-board members were present. 
All non-board members were Clsked to leave Mondav 's meetinj! 
exceptin/Z one representative Irom each ul the campus media . 
Later several students were permitted to speak at the meet in/Z 
because Weiss said he " Iell intimidated ." 

The Comm Board 's orlj!inal budj!et called for a two thousand 
dollar cutin the TRITO\" Tnll::S allocation. At a Comm Board 
meeting two weeks a/Zo. chairman Debbie Smith said the TT 
cut WClS made in order k> balclOce the CommUnications BoCird

KSDT requested S10.500 in salaries when their total bud/Zetlast 
year was less than $6.000. Olnev commented that " j!oin/Z from $6.000 in total costs last year to a request of $25.000 this year 
takes a little bit of /Zall .·· Olne~' also pointed out that 25 per cent 
of the TRITO:\ TIMES proposed budj!et is for sCllaries while 40 
per cent 01 KSDT 's is earmarked for salaries. Kessel stated " I 
think the TRITO\" T1M£S is over-sa laried ." 

On the issue of salaries. ,}:T editor Molly Selvin pointed out 
that they were alreadv low and that Clnv cuts would result in the 
loss ot important sta r"f members. To this Reed replied . " I think 
that" a lot of bullshit. " Selvln commented that "TT salaries 
are the same this year CIS last. while KSUT requested triplmj! 
of their salaries." 

We iss said he feels the TRITO:\ TIMES salaries ilre 
"outrClj!eous.·· Asked if he felt that S25 a week is an outraj!eous 
salar~' for 50 hours of wurk pl'r week . Weiss replied that he lelt 
that 820 was a mure suitable saICl[\' for the t~'pe of service the 
TRITO\" TI~IES provides. 

When the board bej!Cln discussion uf spec~fic budj!et proposClls 
KSDT manCl/Zer John Clark sCiid he could not make Cln~' cut: in 
the proposed allocation of :!I.94i. Selvin said the TRITO\" 
TIMI::S could cut Sl.OOO dollars frum their propused allocation 
of 522.500. Selvin pointed out thClt tlJe TRITO\" TL\IES has 
alwa\'s operated on a minimum budget Clnd thClt Clm' cuts would 
be undesirable . 

After about two hours ot discussion on the budj!et. three 
students entered the meetinj! Clnd were told that the board was 
in "executive" session Clnd the~' would ha ve to leave. Later the 
three returned with Ken Carr . AS Commissioner of External 
Affair. Carr said the meetinlZ wa "bullshit" and demanded 
there be a referendum to determine how Comm Board lund be 
divided. Weiss told the TRITO\" T1MI::S thClt he " probabl~' 
should ha\'e adjourned the meetinll after Ken Carr 's 
disruption." Weiss added. however. thClt he believes "the 
decisions reached b~' the board were lair ."

Reaction to the Comm Board 's preliminary budget wa 
immediate. ;\orman Olney pointed out that the Board had 
received several recommendations calling lor lull I.undlnj! of 
the TRITO\" T/:'IIES. The Revelle .college /Zovernment had 
recommended that the TT be given first priority for lundln/Z. 
Revelle Provost Paul allman. a member of the Rej!1 tration 
Fee Comm ittee. commented that " if the CommunicatIOns

Rej! i tration Fee Com mittel'. it behooves them to show bv 
their actions that the~' Cl re l'nsilive and conc rned about the

Weiss said that the adopted budget i only a preliminary one. 
and that chCl nge may stili be made at the next Comm Boc.r J

Crew Keeps Stroking 
Andy Estobrook 

In this fanc~ . Irill~· . \·ou·l!otta·have·a·j!immick world of sports. 
one sport floats a cut abovP the others. Crew combines the tru~ 
notion of ph~sical fitness and conditioninj/ with finesse . skill and 
the American wa~·. Yes. Ir iends. crew is the sport that makes vou 
a man. the sport that mClkes mothers prouu. 

I suppose before Il!et too involved with the intricacies of crew. I 
should first explain to the fres hmen exat tlv what I mean bv the 
words "crew" and " rowing." First of all .' " <:rew" is a lIeneral 
term used to describe all 01 the various torms. classes. and stvles 
of the art of "rowing." .\ow this " rowinj!" is not the everyda\' 
sense of rowing a rowboat. This t:;pe rowing is much more 
complicated. because there ~re usuall\' eij!ht oarsmen to a boat 
and each 01 these eight oarsmen stroke one oar. Th is is where 
finesse counts heavv. The object 01 crew racmg is to be able to 
row tOj!ether and put the strenj!th 01 ei~ ht people into a single . 
uniform motion. B. accomplishing this. your boat will go laster. 
which is also the object. 

There is much more to the sport of crew than cali ~ printed 
here. so if I've perchance stimulated some spark o[ curiosity. YOU 
can learn a lot more b\' either calling 453·6731 Of'StoPpinll by Apt. 
L.3. :'Iluir Apartments. The people there can answer any questions 
or j!ive ~ou an~ Inlo you need . 

The 'CSO Crew team. \,ounj! Clnd inexperienced. hasn 't lared 
too well in recent \'ears. in laet. last veal' the\' didn 't win a race. 
But this year. under the sharp eves' 01 Coach Gabor. the team 
expects to 110 much better. with il large part of the lightweight

A Newspaper for 
the Rich? 

The question is no longer who gets the money. It has 
become obvious that there is simply not enough money 
to adequately finance the TRITON TIMES, KSDT and 
the subsidiary journals. 

When the TT's 1971·72 budget was drafted last spring, 
there was no padding and no allowance for the 6% rate of 
inflation. All expenses jJave remained the same eKcept 
for increased printing costs which additional ad 
revenues can not cover. From that original plan, n,ooo 
was cut by the Communications Board Monday night. If 
the proposed AS referendum does not favor the TT, it 
appears that we will be forced to suffer additional cuts. 

At present, the Comm Board has mandated that the 
cuts will come from both operational expenses and from 
salaries. After exploration of all possible alternatives, 
the T.T. staff agreed a cut in only the operational 
expenses will be the easiest to cope with. 

Why couldn't the TT take a salary cut and operate just 
as effectively? A salary cut will result in the loss of 
several members of our editorial staff. These people 
depend upon their salaries to live. That means pay for 
food, rent, clothing, dentist bills , books, tuition, etc, are 
on sao to S 100 a month. Now that's a good trick at the 
present salary level but would be impossible on any less. 

Why wouldn't it be possible for us to take a second job 
to supplement our incomes? Editors put in an average of 
3S hours a week (including two long nights at the 
printers) in addition to carrying a full academic load . 
There just isn't time left for anything else. 

If these people are forced to quit who would take their 
place? Students now in editorial positions have already 
worked two to three years on the TT, mostly on a non· 
paying basis. When they acquired their technical skills 
and proved themselves competent, they were moved 
into editorial positions by vote of the staff and approval 
of the Comm Board. Could freshmen who have joined 
the staff this year and just begun to learn, replace their 
editors? Or would journalistically competent students 
who are currently outside of the staff magically appear 
and offer to work at least 35 hours a week for $70 a month 
or less? 

The TT has only been alive for five years. Those of us 
who can look back three or four years feel we have 
established a foothold. With the majority of our 
technical problems behind us we find we are now able to 
concentrate our efforts on improved coverage. 

We are the firsl to admit we aren't the perfect 
newspaper and its that realization which keeps us at the 
typewriter until sometimes Ihree in the morn in!!. But for 
a 101 of us at the 1T Ihe keys are going 10 crash off Ihat 
typewriter unless we can keep our salaries. 

There's a 101 of talk these days about equal 
opportunity. If salaries are cut, this paper will only be 
an opportunity for Ihose students who are financially 
secure. 

Think about it·!!!

What stands in the way of

quite noticeably. Mt. Soledad , 
Radio signals don 't go through

them either. So. with Mt . 
Soledad between the campus 
transmitter site and Pacific 
Beach . parts of that 
communitv will not be able to

you say. " so if that's true. why 
don 't you put the transmitter

Everybody else does."

New Releases: Berlioz, Schubert, Chopin 
Kevin Olson 

For those of you whose hearts nutter at the 
mention of Van Cliburn's name. we bave My 
Favorlle Eaeore. IRCA LSC·31BSI . Poland 's 
favorite son is back with more of his jZreatest 
hits. and encores the\' are indeed. from the 
stirrinjZ Etude in C Minor by Chopin to the 
mvstic subletv of Debuss\" 's Reflets Daas 
LOeau Althou~h all the pieces here - b,· 
Scriabin. Chopin . Debussy. Szymanowski and 
Rachmaninoff - have those qualities pleasing 
to an audience desirous of more. the inclusion of 
the lonller and more serious Scherzo in B-flat 
Minor, 0,. 31 by Chopin is somewhat 
incongruous. The pla\'inll itself. althoullh at 
times rather uninspired . has the technical 
!lawlessness one associates with Cliburn. and 
that alone makes the album worth keepinjZ 

From a master of the piano. we turn to a 
master of the violin in Heifetz: Fanta.ie Op. l~ 
by Schubert, and Serenade Melaacoligue Valse 
by Tschaikowsky I RCA LSC-31091. Franz 
Schubert could perhaps be considered a musica l 
counterpart of the poet Rimbaudire - povertv 
and little or no recognition throullhoul life : 
death at the tragic age of 31. Like a shooting 
star. his musical pirit burned only briefl\' in the 
constellation of nineteenth·centur~· composers. 
yet he manaj!ed to compose over a thousand 
works. of which the Fantasle is one of his last 
and best. It is a profound and moving work . yet 
contains the lightness and simple beaut~· onl.\· a 
master like Heife tz can give. 

On the piece by Tschaikowsky. which Heifetz ' 
violin dominates with the same burning 

intenSity. I was overwhelmed by a quote from 
Eric 810m in the liner notes :" Iit iSI hillhl~' 
characteristic of Tschaikowsky' s art in that 
vein of minjZled sadness and IIraciousness in 
which he excelled when he felt thinlls 
profoundly without heinjZ in too emotionalh' 
self·induillent a mood." And that prettv much 
savs it all. 

Last is a new version of Berlioz' Requiem 
IRCA Victor VICS-6043. 2 records I. done wi th 
Charles Munch 's Boston Symphony Orchestra 
and the New Enlliand Conservatory Chorus. The 
Requiem is ipso facto a work of the deepest 
nature. and is given a worthy treatment here. 
althoujlh the ps~'chedelic cover would have the 
composer turninll in his jZrave. The Requiem is 
a sweepinll series of ma.jestically empyreal 
movements. buildinl/ in intensity somewhat like 
a theatre drama. and 'maintains its spiritual 
puissance throughout the muiad of variations 
in rhnhm. dynamics. melod~' and harmony that 
Berlioz contributes. 

Such diversity - four brass choirs. flutes and 
trombones amidst tenors and bas es - millht 
seem awkward in a lesser composer. but it 
serves here onl\" to indicate the extent of 
Berlioz' greatness. Especiall~' appealinj! is the 
plaintiveh' touching tenor solo. backed b\' a 
subtle arrav of strinl!s and mixed voices. in 
Sanetas, which is worth a . 'Grand Prix du 
Disque" by itself . The next time ~'our acid rock· 
loving friend is in a more spiritually pensive 
mood . tr~' introducinj! him to classical music 
with something like the Reqlllem, and I'll 
guarantee you a convert.

just a little late ~ Is there no 
end in sillht? Well fo lks. whv 
not take a little bread and turn 
on to the new taste sensation -
the Teen Anllels and beer. :-\0. 
this isn't a nell. Hostess 
product. nor it it a super 
concoction of Holl v Holmes. 
It·s. ~'es folks. an 'intramural 
co-ed football team . They 
specia l ize i n f u n. 
entertainment. and a healthy 
wav to I/et hillh. This IIroup of 
(un·lovinl/ freaks has taken the 
American lIame of football and 
stood it on its pointed lillie 
head. 

So lar in their last two j!ames 
these dej!e nerates ha,'e 
manalled to consume two kells 
of beer and turn the intramural 
held into a total state of 
anarchy. :\ot bad tor a jlroup of 
lonj!-haired collelle students 
who don't know anv beuer. 

Probablv the stranl/eSl lor is 
it really~ I thing about the Teen 
Anl/els . is that the~' pla~' to 
lose. ;\Iuch like the :'\ew Your 
Mets. their fatal charm lies in 
the fact that the" truly enjoy 
losinll - in tact. the\' are upset 
if they don ·t. In the words of 
one of the more inebria ted 
members of the team. after 
their last j!ame. " 5/&+. we 
almost won that game." 
Shades of Charlie Chaplin and 
the Keystone Kops . we have on 
our \"er~' own campus aI/roup 
of bunglinj! heroes who actually 
let the fans win in the end! Is 
this the American Wa~'~ Well . I 
certainh' hope so: And if b~' 
chance \,ou want to get in on a 
piece of the act ion. find out 
lI'hen their next game is. brinj!
