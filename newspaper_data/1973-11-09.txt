Sex Clinic Opens 
By Rick Drom 

A female psychiatrist and a male psychologist 
have teamed up in a new sex clinic at Revelle. 

The clinic is designed to benefit students , faculty 
and staff at UCSD who have sexual conflicts. The 
clinic will be open on Wednesdays from 3-5 p.m. in 
the Revelle Provost complex . 

Dr. Hugh Pates, a Revelle counselor, will work 
with Dr. Judith Jorgensen , a psychiatrist , in the 
clinic. Dr. Pates, who has a Ph .D. in psychology, 
feels that such a team will be more effective in 
solvi ng problems than other services currently 
offe red on campus . 

"The concept is not new," he explained . " Masters 
and Johnson probably pioneered in this concept of a 
male-female team to work on sexual difficultieS. By 
having both viewpoints involved, sessions can be 
more effective and beneficial," he said . 

An additional bonus to this team will be their 
varied backgrounds. Dr. Pates, with a psychology 
background, will bring a professional knowledge of 
emotions to the team . Dr. Jorgensen will be able to 
offer a different angle on problems. 

Dr. Jorgensen received her M.D. at the UCLA 
Medical School .before entering the field of 
psychia ry. Thus she has a unique knowledge of the 
physical side of sexual conflicts. 

Together, working as a team , they are hopeful that 
both couples and individuals can benefit from their 
sessions. 

As Dr . Jorgensen explained , "This clinic should 
be especially helpful for students at UCSD, since 
this is a crucial time in their lives. Sexual problems 
can be an important concern for students . Our dfop-
in sex clinic is an effort to reach these individuals 
and try and help them." 

For the first few weeks anyone interested in such 
help can Just drop In, without an appointment. Later 
appointments can probably be made. 

Dr. Pates described all sessions as being sup-
portive and Informative. The sessions can either be 
private or with small groups; since the latter method 
does have some advantages. 

By discussing problems and concerns in a small 
group, often people realize that they are not "alone". 
Instead of being the on ly one ' with a particular 
concern, they find that others share their feelings. 
Also group sessions often aid by bringing different 
viewpoints upon the same concern. 

Dr. Pates and Dr. Jorgensen emphasized that 
faculty and 8taff are Invited to attend as well as 
students. Their drop-In sex clinic Is only a small part 
of the Wide range of counseling services offered at 
UCSD. 

This Clinic will work In conjunction with the 
Health Center and the Psychological and Coun-
seling Services already existing on campus . 

More Information about this clinic and other 
services can be obtained by calling Dr. Pates at

Director of University Center 
Talks About Future Plans 

By David L. Buchbinder 

" As Director of the new University Center, I hope 
to organize activities which will bring people 
together as people and not as faculty, staff or 
students. ", claims Mark Bookman the director of the 
new University Center rising between MC and Muir 
College. 

As Director of the new University Center it is 
Bookman's function to act as a resource person for 
student groups on campus . "I wish to aid and assist 
campus groups in any way possible.", asserts the 
UCLA Law School Graduate. 

In an interview with the Triton Times , Bookman 
explained some of his immediate plans for helping 
student organizations . "Right now , we are at-
tempting to organize a workshop on student 
programs which would be held at the beginning of 
next quarter and would deal with such topics as the 
University bureaucracy, student funding and 
student input to the Adm inist ation. Basically , the 
workshop would attempt to expand the knowledge 
base for students who deal with the Ad-
ministration ." 

Bookman not only attempts to see the problems 
of communication from the viewpoint of students , 
but also from the administrative level. For instance, 
Bookman would like to see a Student Ad-
ministration Intern Program on campus . The 
program would put students in quasi-administrative 
roles, according to Bookman and would help 
students to learn about the higher levels of the 
University. "That is, the program would inform the 
administration of student problems, and the 
students of administrative problems. It would help 
the student body discover where the problems lie at 
UCSD." 

In conjunction with the intern program Bookman 
also envisions a Student Lobby class which would 
deal not only with the problems already mentioned, 
but also with the legal implications of sucn' 
problems. "Take collective bargaining", says the ex-' 
president of the UCLA Graduate Student Council , 
"how will it affect students? Who does one 
collective bargain with? The campus administration, 

or the entire Un iversity? And if the real rise in the 
cost of living is 10% but the legislature only grants a 
6% raise, where is the other 4% to be found? And if 
it is found, will the staff benefit only at a great cost 
to the students?" 

However, Bookman 's main job is to direct the new 
University center, and as he describes his major 
problem at th is time, " How does the Center become 
a Center for the University?" 

Bookman then explained that the manner in which 
the center will realistically become an all University 
Center , will be if everyone shares in it. Mark would 
like to have an all Campus Party at the beginning of 
each year which would recognize the contributions 
of all memebers of the campus , from the highest 
echelons, down to the lowest. 

"Additionally", claims Bookman , "There is no 
reason why student services should rema in iso lated . 
That is, Psychological Services , for example , does 
not.need to rema in restricted to the s ixth f loor of 2D. 
Communication is a two way street. Campus 
Services should come to the student as well as the 
student going to the service." 

According to Bookman , the University Center will 
be open on February 1. It will contain meeting 
rooms and 12 offices to be util ized by student 
organ izations. 

During the next week, explained Bookman , all 
student organizations should be receiving a letter 
informing them to apply for space. The awarding of 
space will be done on a priority basis and all awards 
will be made by the Undergraduate Student Council. 
" Hopefully" , asS'erts the University Center Director, 
"Several groups may be able to share offices 
together, thereby enabling all student organizations 
to have space in the new facility ." 

Groups who do not receive such a letter should 
feel free to contact Mark at ex . 2943 or Rick Drom at 
e~ . 1016. 

" Remember", concluded Bookman , " The 
University Cen'ter is a new facility . We have an 
excellent opportunity to develop good program-
ming, and not make the mistakes made by other 
campuses."

Activities Planned for Christian 
-Emphasis Week 

The week of November 12-16 has been designated 
Christian Emphasis Week at UCSD. Various ac-
tivities are planned throughout this week to present 
a Biblical view on a variety of topics including sex, 
the occult and prophecy, among others. The 
discussions on sex and the occult will be held In the 
Revelle Cafeteria at 8 : 30 on Tuesday and Thursday 
respectively. Both of these discussions are being 
co-sponsored by the Revelle College Guest-In 
Residence Committee . We are encourag in g 
students and faculty from the entire campus to 
come and listen and participate In these 
discussions. After the topic has been presented a 
question and answer period will begin . The talk on 
sex should prove to provoke some Interesting 
discussion. 

Also during the week a group of Christian 
scholars and professors from schools such as the 
University of Texas, Harvard, Dallas Theological 
Seminary, University of Cambridge, institute of 
Bibl ical Studies, and New York University will be 
speaking on diverse topics in some class lectures 
throughout the week. 

A short resume of the noon and evening topics is 
presented tlere with a calendar of events for the 
week. A more in-depth presentation will appear in 
Tuesday's Triton Times. 

MONDAY-On Monday the lamb's Players, a 
Med ieval street theatre troupe wi II present their 
successful performance of the Medieval morality 
play, "The Hound of Everyman ." Will the Great Red 
Father convince Everyman to make it under the 
buxom embrace of ruby-Ii pped lust? How will Bent-
brain stay sober as a jug? Is Dead Fred really dead? 
Can lucretia, the soothsayer of the solar sanctum, 
mesmerize our hero long enough to meet his deadly 
demise? And what would his wife say if she knew he 
was drinking himself to death. The answers to these 
and more will be yours in the Medieval Tradition 
from the wooden stage and the painted faces of the 
roving Lamb's Players drama troupe. No money do 
we take from your purse but It may cost you your 
life. The lamb's Players will be performing back-to-
back performances at 12 noon and 1 :15 on Revelle 
Plaza. 

TUESDAY-"Sex and the New Morality" Can 
situational ethics be applied to the areas of sex and 
love? Are there any absolutes or was man given the 
choice to use sex as he sees fit? What are the 
consequences of having no absolutes and a 
relativistic society? Does sleeping with your 
girlfriend cause any adverse psychological effects, 
like guilt? What do sociologists and psychologists 
of our day like Alvin Toffler, author of Future 
Shock, say concerning this issue? Can the Bible 

have anything relevant to say concerning the area of 
sex? Do you have gripes concerning the supposed 
Puritanical view of sex and love In the Bible, come 
voice your grievances at the discussion. This 
discussion will be open ended, any question 
concerning sex or related fields will be discussed 
after the talk. The discussion will begin on Tuesday 
evening In Revelle Cafeteria at 8 :30 p .m. 

WEDNESDAY-On Wednesday evening the 
Athletes In Action "West" Basketball team will be 
playing our own UCSD Tritons. The AlA basketball 
teams have generally been very good in the past. 
last year's "East" team almost edged North 
Carolina State (ranked about 3rd in the nation at the 
time) in a thrilling game. The two teams should 
make for an exciting game. 

THURSDAY-"The Devil Trap" Is there any ex-
planation for the sudden rise of interest across 
Arnerica in the areas of the occult and witches? Are 
Ouija boards and tarot cards harmlessgamesor does 
a spiritllal force guide these objects as some people 
claim? Is the answer found in sorcery and the quest 
for spiritual possession as Casteneda believes and 
writes about in his books , The Teachin~s of Don 
Juan and Journey to Ixlan. Do tables rea ly levitate 
i'iidcan people call-up the dead through seances? 
Does Satan exist? And if so, what powers does He 
have? Or, is the Satanic church in San Francisco 
merely a myth? Are our national leaders in Congress 
involved In the occult and the seeking of answers 
through mediums as Jeanne Dixon? COUld you be 
involved in the Devil Trap? These issues and a host 
of others will be dealt with on the talk "The Devil 
Trap" . Also how the occult has affected our 
universities will be discussed . 

FRIDAY-"Where is Mankind Headed?" Friday at 
noon, in Revelle Plaza, Hal Lindsey, author of the 
best selling books The Late Great Planet Earth and 
Satan is Alive and Well on Planet Earth will be 
speiiking on the topic of Bible Prophecy. Does the 
Bible predict the occurence of certain events, such 
as the reuniting of Israel as a nation, the abundance 
of earthquakes and famines? What is the real truth 
behind the Middle East Crisis? Did the prophets of 
long ago record and prophesy about the times we 
are living in? Did they talk about this generation of 
people alive today? Are we in the time of fulfillment 
of Christ's words when He said, "When you see all 
these things come to pass you will know I am near, 
right at the door." 

If you are interested In reading up on this area 
before Hal's talk on Friday, copies of his book The 
late Great Planet Earth are available at both the 
University Bookstore and the Revelle Sundry Store.

Healt'h Workshops 
San Diego, November 2, 1973--A second series of 

four one-day Workshops , relating to health plan-
ning, will be conducted by the . Comprehensive 
Health Planning Association of Imperial , Rivers ide 
and San Diego Counties (CHPA) at the Hilton Inn, 
1775 E. Mission Bay Drive, San Diego, November 27-
30, from 8 :30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m . each day. ' 

Titled "Four MORE Days to Remember -- For

both students and professors . For Instance, he has 
nothing but sympathy for the freshman who 
stumbles on campus with what may be the largest 
single amount of money he's ever had at one time, 
but who has to chuck a significant portion of It Into 
texts right away. In fact, Mares said the first week or 
two of school is usually the most frustrating for 
everyone, and the most " negative" in terms of 
response. " After waiting in an hour and a half line at 
the cashier's office, for instance, you 're not going to 
be too happy to find that none of the books you have 
to buy have arrived yet," he said . 

And obviously, If we can't get out books, the only 
people ar_ound we can pick on are the people at the 
bookstore. So they get picked on. But Mares said 
that most foul-ups on book orders are tt"le fault of 
the publisher or distributer. In fact, ordering 
problems have Increased substantially in the past 
year or two. 

As a result of the long ordering periods for books 
(six weeks for US orders, and up to three months for 
filled foreign orders), professors had .to have book 
lists for their winter classes in to the bookstore the 
day before the opening of the fall quarter. Mares 
said that many departments haven't even aSSigned 
classes by that time, but that any head start In 
ordering is helpful. At any rate, most of the winter 
term inventorty Is in now. Whew. 

Another problem with books is the present 
national paper shortage (notice they've been 
blowing down the Sunday funnies to fit more on a 
page?) that has affected most of the country's 
publishers. Unfortunately, Mares said, that shortage 
Is expected to get worse before It gets better, so to 
speak, as is a shorta~e of cotton that may torce a 
markup in prices for T-Shirts and like Items. 

. Feedback? 
Mares said feedback from the community comes 

"daily." Although people tend to jabber only when 
they're mad about something, he said people often 
compliment him and his staff on bookstore services. 
("But many of the complaints have to do with the 
way a cashier gives a customer his change.") And a 
few years back, in a poll of academic departments 
concerning the bookstore, nearly all comments were 
faborable, save an occasional "Bookstore? Oh, that 
bookstore." But Mares expects to be taken for 
granted, and doesn't seem to mind it. 

We had to leave about then. (Had to buy some 
paper to type the article on .) Anyway, someone 
wanted to know where the Blo 6'78 books were, she'd 
been 100kinIJ all over for them.

OPINION 
I' O.K., You're O.K. 
An~ I.T.T.'s Just Great 

by Michael Horowitz 
Guest Writer 

Hardly anybody noticed last month when the posh 
Florida suburb, Cape Kennedy, received permiSSion 
to regress its identity back to the Spanish som-
nabullsm of Cape Canaveral. It Is a time to recall the 
sleepy siesta of the Iberian hacienda; sharp-
tongued idealism is gauchely out of place. Del Mar 
Downs indeed! Next comes La Jolla Reds .. . 

It is fitting, in this era of Cultural Cop-Out, that 
the two leading social science sellers should be 
B.F. Skinner's aeyond Freedom end Dignity and 
T.A. Harris' I'm OK, You',. OK. Together they ad-
vance a futuristic psychology which, coupled with 
pol itical apathy, could seal the coffin on personal 
resistance within the Holy Corporate Empire. 

Enough has been said of Skinner's anti-utopia. 
Suffice it to say that , through Citing the crisis 
brought on by a reckless oligarchy , It rational izes 
stricter control of the people. It Is really I'm OK, 
You',. OK that has been haunting me of late. For it 
is Harris who, masking as the Santa Claus of Happy 
Consciousness ; deals tha politics of refusal an 
ideological stink-bomb. 

Let's analyze this pseudo-Nick's ho ho. Harris 
beg ins with Freud ; our experience as children is 
said to dictate our stance as adults. Through an 
insecure childhood , we may conclude that I'm Not 
O~ , You're OK and be a dependent adult . Or I'm Not 
OK and You 're Not OK and be a despairing adult. 

In Harris' world, of course, there are alternatives 
to invalidism and suicide. One can emerge from 
childhood with an intact ego. For those , there are 
two other choices . I'm OK, You're OK is Harris' 
favorite; that's the tolerant adult. Then there's I'm 
OK, You 're Not OK. That's a situation where a kid 
feels together but thinks the parents have problems. 
You smile, right? 'Cause that sounds like little Che 
in his crib, righ t? Wrong , says Happy Harris. That's 
no Radical , that 's a Criminal! "He refuses to give 
up .. . hatred sustains him ." 

It all seems baffling that any trained psychologist 
could flatly characterize the I'm OK, You 're Not OK 
attituae as Criminal. It sounds like Soviet 
psychology, blandly tossing political malcontents 
into insane asylums. What is it with Established 
Psychology? Does it feel so threatened by hostility 
that rebels must be called lunatiCS? 

Yet It Is not Harris' attack on the Negative Psyche 
that is so important; for few actually believe that 
prophets are necessarily gangsters. What is more 
insidious is Harris' model : I'm OK, You're OK. For 
here we have our Sacramento physician's Stance Par 
Excelience, the Happy Consciousness of Pure 
Tolerance. 

The question of tolerance in liberal society has 
been examined before , notably by Marcuse, Moore, 
and Wolff in Critique of Pure Tolerance. It is enough 
for our purposes to understand that the demand for 
tolerance, in a society of considerable destructive 
force , is a political demand. Under the guise of 
reasonableness, the System asks your cooperation . 
But , in a situation already agressive, civility is not 
reasonable - it is passive . 

Granted , Harris is chiefly concerned with the 
micro-dynamics of personal interaction. Like the 
Blue Cross commercials , he frets that we're too hard 
on each other; that the climate of mental health 
would be improved if we all suspended our 
criticisms of each other. Yet it is Harris who speaks 
of criminals , who extrapolates social judgment fro m 
psycho logical class ification. 

The issue hardly needs Harris' comp licity . TO 
advocate suspen sion of value as a means of 
facilitat ing health is inevitably worrisome. In a 
society in which struggles against dominat ion are 
graphically current, there will be a comfortable 
bourgeoiS longing for tranquil ity ... and a campaign 
to convince people to be pleasant There are Smiley 
buttons , Muzak, and bumperstickers (" Have a nice 
day ! ') to counter Watergate, Chile, and monopoly . 
With i this framework , there Is bound to be an 
atter'l pt to elevate therapeut ic understanding into a 
socidl ethos . 

T. t>, . Harris has not written a political book , 
although he sometimes lapses into class-tainted 
social opin ion. But to publi~h I'm OK, You're OK in 
the 'Jlxon era, without establishing some strong 
prov ,sbs against conservat ive co-optation, Is to 
invlt:3 ,hat co-optat ion. One notices suspic iously the 
run-lway popularity of this medicinal guide. Are so 
many people in group therapy? Or is I'm OK, You're 
OK !ust what the Right ordered .. . for Richard Nixon, 
the · Chilean colonels, and the rising shadow of 
I.T.T.?

What If You Are Wrong? 
Editor : 
I am writing this letter from Israel after a 

4 months stay as a New Immigrant and Professor of 
the Hebrew University, as a religious agnostic , a 
socialist of long standing and as an active (twice 
imprisoned) opponent of the kind of imperialist war 
that was waQed in Viet Nam. 

What I have seen in these 4 months has confirmed 
my beliefs. Israel is a Democrat ic State which is 
acting responsibly and humanely to improve the 
conditions of its disadvantaged citizens, particularly 
among the Sephardic Jews and Arabs. It Ji the 
fitting repOSitory of an intellectual, spiritual and 
ethnic tradition that has remained viable for 
thousands of years and within the space of one 
century produced a Marx, a Freud, and an Einstein. 
It is forging unbreakable links with the people of the 
oCCupied territories - Gaza and the West Bank - and 
with Jordan itself, through encouragement of in-
dustry and trade , training in scient ific agricultural 
methods, organisation of trade unions , and en-
couragement of unrestricted travel throughout 
territories and across the Jordan River. These 
relationships have already sparked a true revolution 
among the Arabs - in economic status, in the 
liberation of women , in the enlargement of 
economic and cultural horizons. Given the gift of 
Peace, they would inevitably lead to a harmonious 
comm unity . 

But now we are at war. The governments of Egypt 
and Syria played an elaborate charade with the 
Russians. They mobilised in October of 1973 just as 
they had mobilised in June of 1967 and as they were 
ready to attack then , they were ready now and did 
attack. 

We are at war against the governments of 100

equally cyn ical African governments who trade

. ..,r-

by Robert Carroll 

A number of muddleheaded sub-
jects -- I w ish I could call them citizens 
-- are today clamoring for the ab-
dication of Richard Nixon . They do so, 
I thi nk , without genuinely considering 
both the gravity and absurdity of such 
a demand. In the first place , RN was 
elected to Executive Power by an 
overwhelm ing majority- of the voters . 
He received, as tle has so often 
remi nded his most dogged critics, a 
mandate to rule according to 'his 
Republican principles . At no time In 
our history has the silent majority --
those whose mouths are closed either 
by fear or Ignorance -- ever made its 
voice so loudly and clearly heard . This 
is the twentieth century and our 
people are the best educated in the 
universe. Would it be reasonable to 
believe that an Enlightened Public 
could be so mistaken about the 
principles of its chosen leader, as 
those would have us believe who now 
scream for the abdicat ion of RN? 
Furthermore, this is a time of great 
international tension , and noth ing 
could be more conducive to the 
dissolution of the Republic than the 
exacerbation of our differences, wh ich 
are, after all , only about th ings in-
different. To contest the actions of our 
President -- such as the secret 
bombings of Cambodia, the in-
tervention in the In case, the 
establi shment of a private pol ice 
force, enemy lists, etc., and the 
general obstruction of justice in the 
so-called Watergate Affair, to name 
only a few -- to contest such actions 
merely adds fuel to the fire and 
weakens our prestige in the eyes of 
foreign nations . And nothing is now 
mo re compelling than the reestablish-
ment of our rightful pOSition in the 
eyes of World Opinion . Thus , I say, 
RN should not abdicate in this time of 
criSiS. And I call upon him not to give 
in to his unthinking critiCS who have 
only their own interest at heart and 
care nothing for the general interest of 
the Republic as a whole. 

Furth ermore , as any pol itical 
theorist knows, when one branch of 
govern ment weakens or begins to 
usurp the power of the others -- as is 
the case with our Legislat ive and 
Judicial branches respectively -- in 
order to preserve the integrity and 
power of the Union it is up to the 
stronger or threatened branch to 
assert itself with uncommon vigor in 
th e true spirit of Democratic 
Republicanism. Hence, now more 
than ever, it has become Imperative for 
the Executive branch of our govern-
ment to pick up the slack left by a 
weak and ineffectual Leg islature and 

to ward off the usurpers in the 
Judiciary. Now more than ever should 
we rally behind our Presid ent, 
demonstrating our unfaltering support 
of his despotic actions . Here it might 
be appropos to recall the words of the 
wise J.J . Rousseau , concerning the 
difference between a tyrant and a 
despot . Let me make this perfectly 
clear, my fellow Americans, Richard 
Nixon is not a tyrant as Ralph Nader 
has claimed . A tyrant is a usurper, and 
the mandate of the silent majority has 
definitely declared that RN is no 
usurper, but a lawfully elected 
President . A despot, on the other 
hand, is one who puts himself above 
the law, and that RN has done in order 
to mak.e this a more perfect un ion and 
preserve the integrity of our Union . 

Why must we conti nue to deprecate 
our Leader? Why must the press make 
every effort to discredit him with their 
biased, distorted, if accurate , 
reportage? Where Is the ed itor willing 
to portray RN as a lover of dogs , as a 
human being who suffers under the 
delUSion which all of us are afflicted 
with in some degree: the delusion of 
being more than mere humans? Where 
is the reporter interested in human 
Interest? Richard Nixon has never 
acted towards the people, has never 
treated the people, with anything but 
the respect they deserve. So why must 
we treat him with the disrespect more 
deserving of madmen and tyrants than 
mere despots? 

Some cry out about the President's 
associates and friends . How could 
anyone, they ask, consistently 
surround himself with an elite corp of 
sartorially splendid criminals. But 
here again we see the vic ious wheels 
of the press turning on innuendo and 
unproved allegations. Simply look to 
the prisons , my friends , and you will 
not f ind Richard Nixon 's friends there . 
That should sufficiently disprove the 
claim that RN constantly surrounds 
himself with extortionists, con men, 
burglars, and thieves. RN 's friends are 
not in prison ; his enemies are. 

And so my fellow subjects, I im-
plore you to cease this pernicious 
ciamouring for the abdication of our 
President. Cease these dangerous 
cries of impeachment. After all , your 
freedom is at stake. Free people, 
remember this maxim of Rousseau : 
" liberty can be gained , but never 
regained. " Would you give up your 
freedom only to gain vengeance on a 
man chosen by the popular press as a 
scapegoat for all your problems? 
Pr ices have gone up enormously, I 
know. But , profits have gone up even 
more enormously . Would you give up 
creating this great wealth for others? 
Would you give up your freedom? " A 
little disturbance gives vigour to the 
soul, and what really makes the 
species prosper Is not peace but 
freedom." Let us hear not more cries 
for peace at the expense of our 
freedom . Let us call upon our 
President to remain at the helm and 
continue to heap upon us our just 
deserts! It is your duty as true sub-
jects.

Letters To The Editor 
Locked Out 

Dear Editor : 
Last week, desiring a 

cu p of coffee, I went 
down to the Revelle 
Dining Commons. The 
crush of people in the 
room adjoining the 
Revelle Caf was in-
credible. This situation Is 
common . 

Looking next door was 
the Revelle Cafeteria . 
Empty . Now, I hate to 
think of the. "Good 0 1' 
Days" at my tender age 
but it wasn't long ago 
(about ' a year) when Holly 
Holmes or the Revelle 
Dorm Committee decided 
to stop the use of the Caf 
as an all-hours " student 
cen ter. " 

As an undergrad , I used 
to commonly use the Caf 
as a place to study , talk , 
read the newspaper, etc . 
So did everyone else. 
Now Revelle has the room 
next door and the Coffee 
Hut. The situation at Mu ir 
is worse . I expect Th ird is 
similar. 

Cold weather is, or will 
be soon , upon us. I 
suggest the Caf be re-
opened to general use . It 
will not change matters -
mealtimes are at present 
chaotic. They were 
chaotic five years ago 
when the Caf was 
generally open. The food 
never has been good. 

It is a building of the 
University and thus , I 
would assume, not yet a 
pr i 'late enterpr i se . I 
question the strict legality 
of keeping a designated 
public place closed to the 
public . 

I would appreCiate

informed the readers of 
th is paper that : " Sex is a 
white man's worry , he is 
the one who is afraid he 
can't satisfy you 
sexuall y .... " . If you had 
not informed me, I would 
have still been 
disillusioned to believe all 
those false ideas that : all 
men are created equal (as 
far as race, color, or 
creed) ; and that every 
race , color , or creed 
shares in its misfortunate 
vict i ms, or perhaps in 
words which might be 
more appropriate , in a 
group of people who are 
incompetent . 

Yes I had been so 
disillus ioned to the point 
that I thought that the 
black man was just as 
good as any other man. 
How could I have been? In 
fact I had even wondered 
why people cannot live as 
brothers and sisters , and 
why there seemed to be 
so much racism , 
ji ngo i sm , and 
chauvanism . Hopefully 
our dear "black woman" 
will also come to her 
senses , and real ize that 
the "black man" is indeed 
superior, especially (as 
you pointed out) to the 
" white man", when it 
comes to sexual in-
tercourse. She must have 

been lying when she 
stated that she had been 
with black men in bed . 
Either that or they were 
wh ile men in disguise. 

Yes , the white man is 
no comparison for the 
blacK man , especially 
when it comes to that 
native stuff . 

Another thing which is 
just as true , is that the 
.women on campus are far 
superior to the male 
population . Referring now 
back to the letter to the 
editor entit led " Ma le 
Dogs" , our two dear Muir 
women happily pointed 
out to our naive, bra inless 
selfs that the men on 
campus are a bunch of 
slobbering , pimple-faced , 
h ig h school , stereo-
types . By the time I 
graduate from this 
college, w ith all its in-
telligent students , I am 
go ing to be so intell igent 
myself , I won 't know what 
to do . 

I wish to thank all you 
intell igent , mature, non-
a r r 0 g ant ,_ non -
chauvanistic people for all 
the help you 're giving me. 

Seriously, I hope to see 
the day when all men & 
women will be as brothers

VB Weekend 
by Eric Raisters 

Last weekend, as previously advertised, was a 
Volleyball weekend to beat all volleyball weekends. 

The clinic came off spectacularly with C. R. 
Ignacio spreading his wit-and knowledge to all who 
attended. Both UCSD students who attended the 
.clinic, John Grill and Jack Gregg , came away with 
USVBA official's certifications for their ·efforts. 

This however was topped by the almost un-believ~ble match between the Japanese Women's 
Team and the U.S. National Women's Team. 
Although the expected results came to pass, the 
way in which they came to pass was quite unex-
pected . 

In a match the day before, the Japanese team 
demolished the U.S. women in four sets, 15-3,15-7, 
13-15 15-4. Coming to San Diego, the U.S. team decid~d to at least make a good showing against the 
team that took the silver medal at the Mun ich 
Olympics. 

And put on a good show they did . Showing 
strength in spiking and blocking as well as a sound 
defense the US women made the Japanese women 
work ha;d for a 15-10, 12-15, 15-4, 15-8 victory . 

As usual the Japanese women played like ' 
machines, with almost perfect passing and flawless 
defense and in the long run, this factor as well as 
the inco'nsistency of the U. S. team's passing led to 
the downfall of the American girls . 

Hopefully this will not be the last time that such 
an exciting weekend takes place in San Diego, but if 
It is, this show should satisfy even the most ardent 
volleyball fan for the next few months.

UNTITLED VI 
UCSD has undergone 

phenomenal growth in the 
past couple years. The 
increased enrollment in 
the last year alone Was 
about a thousand people. 
At this rate in 10 years 
there could be around 
30,000 bodies roaming 
around the campus. Of 
course with more people 
and more money, one 
never knows what one 
may find ... 

he negotiated for a new 
car, the Chancellor ; s 
house, a job sleeping on 
his new mattress and the 
clincher, a year's supply 
of gas. Along with 
Badman, Choo-choo 
Montgomery , CIF-4A 
player of the Year in Los 
Angeles and Sweet Simon 
Stuporville, New Jersey 
Player of the Year were 
also enticed to play for 
the UCSD football team 
next year. 

The Administration has 
voted to allot 2.5 million 
dollars for th e refur-
bishing of Saltman 
Stadium . The seat ing 
capacity will rise from 
85,000 to 100,000 to allow 
for the renewed interest in 
football on the campus. 
Work will also be started 
to increase the parking lot 
on the Torrey Pines 
Stadium . 

The seventh new gym 
on the UCSD campus was 

dedicated last Th ursday 
in ceremonies presided 
over by Chancellor 
McElroy . The gym is 
equipped with two 
basketball floo rs, a 
swimming pool and two 
thousand new lockers. 

The intramura l 
department reported its 
best year for football 
teams. There are ap-
proximately 70 mens 
leagues and 63 coed 
leagues this year. Rumor 
has It that the All-Stars 
have voted to challenge 
the San Diego Chargers to 
a flag football game at 
their convenience. 

Rumor has it that Chi 
Delta Phi has challenged 
Phi Zappa Krappa to a 
grudge mud puddle fight 
to be held on the Schmidt 
memorial field· · on the 
southeast part of the 
campus. All are invited to 
bring cheerl eadrs. 

By defeating USC last 
Saturday, 42-7, UCSD has 
won the right to appear in 
the Rose Bowl January 1. 
UCSD marched to a 
perlect 10~ season in 
winning the Pacific 9 title 
and ended the regular 
season ranked number 
four in both wire service 
polls . Coach John McKay 
had this to say after the 
astonishing victory , " It · 
was great to beat USC, 
they were a good team 
an d fought hard . Our guys 
from La Jolla truly out-
played them ." 

The UCSD " Athlet ic 
Department announced 
that it will host the NCAA 
Volle yball Cham-
pion ships next year. The 
final matches will be held 
on Black's Beach where 
the new Federal laws 
restric ting clothed 
bathers will be observed. 

Powder Puffers 
Hold ScrimITlage 

Bill Sharman an-
nounced that he has 
accepted the position as 
head basketball coach at 
UCSD. He anticipates a 
winning season this year 
and feels t~at the team 
may even be able to give 
UCLA a run for the 
money. He announced 
that his assistant coach 
will be Paul Trainer who 
was a former player for 
the UCSD Tritons. 

The UCSD rug by team 
has accepted an invitation 
to appear in the World 
Games in New Zealand 
next year. The ruggers 
will be defending their 
title that they won last 
year by defeating the 
nat ional team from 
Eng land . All rugger 
hug gers will once again 
be encouraged to attend 
the game and may even be 
partici pating in a match of 
thei r own . 

Bad man Boomington 
from Tulsa, Oklahoma 
has signed a letter of 
intent to attend UCSD 
next year . He was voted 
high school player of the 
year in the nation and was 
quite a catch for the 
recruiting department. It 
was reported that as well 
as receiving an all ex-
penses paid scholarship, 

The most excit ing flag 
football games are not 
being played on the 
soccer field , but on the 
Third College lawn. Last 
Sunday, twenty energetic 
girls matched wits and 
talent in the first powder-
puff game of the season . 
The Morn igs and the T.C. 
Tornadoes met In a 
deadloCk -- 24-24. 

This game was no spur-
of-the-moment scrimage. 
Each team had practiced 
for days beforehand under 
the di rection of their 
coaches. The Tornadoes 
were guided by Rod Siglar 
and Lambert Harvey , 
wh ile the Mornlgs were 
lead by Randall Jackson 
and Curtis King . 

To start off the match , 
Willie Bowman ran a 
spectacular 40 yard 
quarterback keeper to give 
the Mornigs the lead. The 
Tornadoes didn't waste 
time catching up when 
they sent out their star 
player, B .J. Robinson , 
out to gain six pOints on a 
60 yard kick off return . 
Thus prompted , the 
Mornigs brought out their 
most valuable player , Rita 
Carter, who threw if 
spectacular 30 yard pass 
to Linda Cleveland, fixing 
the score 12~ at half-
time. 

At the beginn ing of the 
2nd half , Rita increased

her team's lead with a 40 
yard touchdown. When 
the Tornadoes finally got 
the ball , they brought the 
score up to 18-12 on a two 
yard dive. But , getting 
away with the same trick 
twice, Willie ran another 
quarterback keeper to 
hold the lead at 24-12. 
With two more excellent 
plays, B. J . tied the score 
with a quarterback keeper 
and a five yard flanker 
reverse. 

B::lth the Tornadoes and 
the Mornigs are en-
thusiastic about more 
games and new op-
ponents . They are 
challenging any and all 
other powder puff teams. 

John Davis , co-head of 
the Recreation Center and 
primary organizer of this 
game, has hopes of 
form ing an official 
powder puff football 
league. His other projects 
for the near future are 
coed volleyball , Bidwiz, 
billiards , ping-pong and 
girls' basketball tour-
naments.

Water Polo 

Sweep Highlights Weekend 
Playing with a newly 

found consistency , the 
Triton Water Polo team 
upped its record to 10-5 
with victories over 
Redlands and the 
University of Arizona last 
weekend. 

Friday afternoon the 
Tritons hosted Redlands 
in wh at turned out to be a 
tight game. The Tr itons 
started off slowly but 
built up momentum as 
they came on to score-
four fourth period gO'als to 
overcome a one point 
Redlands lead and win 8-
5 . 

Saturday the Tritons 
kept their momentum 
rolling along as they 
swept past a good 
Arizona team by the score 
of 10-7. 

As usual the Norris 
brothers (Mike and ' John) 
continue to star .. for . the 
Tritons . John has been 
paCing the scoring all year 
and leads the team . with 
37 goals for the season. 

Mike has been a good 
team player, steadying 
the freshmen in their play 
as well as contributing 
offensively. 

One player who has 
been a vast improvement 
over the season has been 
Jeff Kon iges. Jeff started 
out as the thirteenth 
player on the team and 
since then has gone out 
and won himself a 
start ing position . 

The two goalies, Dave 
Christiansen and Pau l 
Bogseth have also im-
proved in their play over 
the course of the season . 

The Tritons b ig test of 
the year will be this 
Saturday as they take on 
the Aztecs of San Diego 
State. State beat UCSD in 
their first meeting this 
year, but the Tritons have 
Improved steadily since 
that game and should be 
ready to give State a 
tough game. The game 
will be played at State this 
Saturday.

Other events on the 
Tritons schedule include 
games against South-
western College and a 
grudge match against 
Loyola , a team that has 
beaten UCSD In two close 
games. The big finale to 
the Water Polo Season 
will be the NCAA Small 
College Championships 
to be held at UCSD over 
the Thanksg iving Holiday. 

The one problem the 
team has right now is a 
depth problem. Several 
members of the team have 
been forced to drop off 
the team because of 
sickness or a heavy study 
load . 

This season has been a 
relative success so far but 
Coach Gary Becker is 
already looking ahead to 
next year. Everyone on 
the team will be returning 
and rumor has it that even 
Mark Liska might t rn out 
next year (way to go 
Mark).

Mahler Madness 
Ronald Magglano 

The UCSD Music Department , In Its 
most typical "don't rock the boat - It's 
more fun to sink it" style, has created 
the biggest splash on campus since 
mother superior jumped the gun and 
landed in Holy Hubert's sanctified 
bathtub. Of course, the cause of all the 
excitement is the image of a slightly 
built man, wearing John Lennon 
spectacles and a mona lisa smile, w~o 
stands front and center on countless 
posters proclaiming November 10 - 18. 
as Mahler Week. 

As if that wasn't enough , bumper 
stickers with such original slogans as 
" Mahler Grooves" and "Honk If You 
Love Mahler" have appeared from 
nowhere. Even the chairman of the 
department has hocked his faded 
sweatshirt with the venerable portrait of 
Ludvig Van in favor of a pale blue, skin 
tight body suit with the inscribed 
challenge : "~II We Are Saying Is Give 
Mahler A Chancel" Indeed, Mahler-
mania appears to be sweeping across 
the campus with a ferocity that hasn't 
been seen since Charley Padowerski 
swept the basement of Urey Hall and 
earned the Linda Lovelace Clean Living 
Award for .1973. 

Amidst this atmosphere of profound 
hysteria, I sampled the feelings of 
several students towards the upcoming 
Mahler week , only to find that no two 
opinions were the same. Hans Off, an 
undergraduate physical therapy major, 
was reminded of the fact t tiat his father 
once drove a 1956 Mahler. Yesia Can, a 
graduate student in animal husbandry , 
when asked what he thought of Mahler 
called for impeachment as the only 
logical alternat ive . And Odielocks 
Goldman, percussionist with the La 
Jolla/University Orchestra , looked up 
from his meal of string beans and 
halloween candy, summarizing the 
mood of the entire campus when he 
choked on a mouthful of carmelcorn 
and said with tears in his eyes , " Mahler 
who ...... 

That for sure, seems to be the 
overriding musical question on campus 
at the moment. Just who is, was, or 
ever shall be Gustav Mahler. To say that 

Mahler was a composer is like saying · 
that a Porsche is a car, that Candice 
Bergen is a woman, that Richard M. 
Nixon is an Idiot. It is a gross un- · 
derstatement of the facts. It would be 
more apt to say that a Porsche is a 
woman, that Candice Bergen is over-
sexed and that Richard M. Nixon Is a ... 
well a great Idiot . By the same token ,' 
Gustav Mahler was not a car, cannot be 
impeached, and whether or not he was 
oversexed will never be known . He was 
however, and for lack of a better term, a 
rnega-compQser. Perhaps more than 
any romantiC composer, Mahler ex-
ploited the symphony orchestra to its 
full potential. 

Amid a background of worldliness 
and overconfidence that swept the 
world at the turn of the 19th century , 
Gustav Mahler wrote prolifically 
romantic music that slaps the ears like 
the hot kiss at the end of a clenched 
fist. 

One certainly cannot ignore Mahler's 
music for it was not meant to be taken 
so lightly. Of his nine complete 
symphonies, only the first three ap-
proach what may be called the "con-
ventional". Beyond that point his or-
chestrations became as expansive and 
exciting to the ears of his age as do the 
electronic melodies of Keith Emerson 
seem to ours . That incredible degree of 
intensity is intrinSiC to Mahler's work 
and it will be well displayed during the 
eight day a week Mahler Music Festival. 

Tom Nee will direct the activities and 
conduct the La Jolla University Or-
chestra, and despite his size, he is a 
man well suited to the enormous Job . 
Howard Wells will set his fingers to the 
piano, and the orchestra of seventy odd 
men (and women) will offer the product 
of over a months work for public 
conSideration . All events are free to 
students: so If you want to impress 
your new girl, your folks , or your parole 
officer with a little cultural education , 
you would do well to discover what 
many all ready know and then join the 
happy, smiling faces chanting the old 
favorite refrain : " Roll Over Beethoven -
We Want Mahler! " 

Don Maker 

Last Su nday , .San 
Diego's most avant-garde 
theatre, "The Crystal 
Palace", presented a tour-
de-force of technical 
theatre entitled Chrysalis . 
Written and directed by 
Rosie Driffield , Chrysalis 
is a flight of Imagination 
and experience, a journey 
into thoughts centered 
above a macabre ad-

Contrary to the impression which seems to fall 
over them, "The Who", as a group, are far from the 
most prolific group around. Their last album of new 
material was WHO'S NEXT, back in 1971, and before 
that TOMMY in 1969. That's 2 albums In four years, 
which is not a staggering amount of material. 

There have been a large number of rereleases of 
old material and reworklngs as in LIVE AT LEEDS; 
MEATY, BEATY, BIG AND BOUNCY, MAGIC BUS, 
and an outpouring of solo albums (except from 
drummer Keith Moon), one each for Daltry and 
Townshend, and three thus far from bassist John 
Entwistle. 

Hence, it's safe to say that Pete Townshend (the 
main writing spirit for "The Who") is being very 
careful exactly what "The Who" Is doing in terms of 
albums. 

And it's paid off well. From their early roots as the 
first "Pop Art" music group, they set a number of 
firsts in the music world with their outrageous stage 
act and violent attitude towards music (the old 
destroying of guitars, amplifiers, mikes, and drums 
after their act). 

Then came TOMMY, largely unheard of for about a 
year, and then heralded as the most important piece 
of rock at that time. The first rock-opera. 

From there, Who's Next?, was the next major 
major release, and if fulfilled the bands promise as 
an important musical group. 

And now, at last the latest release from the mind 
of Pete Townshend : Quadrophenla. 

A lot of talk about the "concept" of th is album is 
bound to be heard, and already it's being bi lled as 
"The Who's" new rock-opera. Now, seriously , 
Tommy was not really an opera, and this Isn't even 
as close as Tommy was , it's merely an album with a 
unifying concept. And an interesting one indeed. 

The album focuses around a young tough named 
Jimmy. Jimmy is an English lad caught in the world 
of mods and rockers that existed back in the early 
day's of a band called "The Who." The essence of 
the album is capturing Jimmy's consciousness . 

The interesting point is, that Jimmy has sort of a 
split consciousness (and who doesn 't?) , and on the 
album, each member of "The Who" represents one 
portion of Jimmy's consciousness, and gets a 
musical theme which represents it. The liner notes 
on the album put it In Jimmy's own words : 

"A touch guy, a helpless dancer. 
A romantic , is it me' for a moment? 
A bloody lunatic, I'll even carry your bags. 
A beggar, a hypocrite, love reign over ~e. 
Schizoprenic? I'm Bleeding Quadrophenlc." 

And happily enough , the album really works. It 
takes "The Who" to new levels of greatness. The 
album is a very unified work , where one song leans 
heavily on the other. The four themes cant inue to 
pop up in and out of different songs, ty i'lg them all 
together. We hear the different levels of con-
sciousness crying out to one another. 

Musically, it is the most advanced work "The 
Who" have done to date. It is the same "Who" 
driving, smashing guitar wo'rk which lent so much 
energy to Tommy , with the addition of the levels of

added Arp Synthesizer that began to show in Who's 
Next. In addit ion, t here is a return of Entwistle to 
using his distinctive horn playing ability, not seen 
since early "Who" songs such as COBWEBS AND 
STRANGE, which add another dimension to the 
work . 

Perhaps most exciting to note is that while 
Daltrey stili handles the lead vocals. the other 
members of "The Who" (particularly Townshend) 
also lend vocals to the album. This provides a 
welcome variety in style and attack. Harmonies and 
background vocals have always become ~'The 
Who's" work when they were employed. 

The album of course offers lots to ponder over for 
those who enjoy Interpreting tyrlcs. The desire to 
relate the entire story to Townshend's life is heavy, 
due to many references to past "Who" endeavors, 
including the stuttering of MY GENERATION in a 
"mini-opera" The Punk Meets the Godfether, and 
even the old Who song The Kid's are Alright popping 
up on the album. 

Musically speaking the album Is very rich (within 
the framework that has become "The Who"), and the 
album's success lies in taking the dramatic energy 
and unity contained in Single songs like aaba 
O'Rlley , and The Song Is Over, and extending this 
energy through two entire albums, so what results is 
one long song cycle, expressing one overall picture. 
The result is truly exciting .

I am uncertain exactly what frustrations drive an 
artist to construct the so-called "Solo" album , but 
I'm usually leary of any such endeavor. When I say 
"solo" album , I mean the album In which the one 
artist plays all instruments and handles all vocals 
h imself as In Paul McCartney's first solo al bum , 

Here we find Roy Wood, former member of the 
now defunct Brit ish " Move", driving force behind 
the origlnat ion of Electric Light Orchestra, and 
currently heading up Wizzard , putting out his first 
solo album . 

My reason for bringing attention to the album at 
all is, suprise of suprises, it Is actually good. 
Wood's album has a feel ing of wholeness and 
freshness that always appears to be missing from 
these one-man band ventures. The album is a 
delicious mixture of style, instrumentation (which 
ranges from cellos and flutes to harmonica and 
banjo), and vocal technique which makes a very 
fulfilling album . 

Stylistically, a brand of light rock sounding at 
times like David Bowie, Wood encompasses a wide 
range of song-style from the sentimental Nancy, 
Sing Me a Song and My Dear ElaIne, to the comical 
Irish loafer [and his henl, Miss Clarite and the 
Computer, and When Grandma Plays the Ba!ljo . 
Loafer for example sounds a bit like ElO playing an 
Irish jig , Miss Clarke employs a wh ispered over 
vocal to capture sense of computerization . 

Wood finds himself at his best with the rockers 
though , and touches his roots w ith Rock Down Low 
and a Rock Medley which closes the album . 

All around, the variety, pace, and cleaness of each 
song make th is an exciting release ; a solo album 
which in no way reeks of soloism .

Sarod Artist to Perform 
Ashish Khan ac-

complished sarod artist 
will present a concert of 
North Indian classical 
music sponsored by the 
UCSD Music Department 
and Campus Program-
ming Board , Friday , 
November 16, in Revelle 
Cafeteria at 8 :30 p.m. 

Tansen , a court 
musician of Akbar the 
Great , founded the Gur-
ana , or school ,ofwhich 
Ashish Khan is the direct 
heir. Ashish 's grandfather 
was the noted Pad-
mabushen Allaudin Khan , 
teacher of Ravi Shankar, 
Ashish 's father. 

Ashish began training 
with his grandfather and 
continued with his uncle 
and father . Only thirty 
years old , Ashish has 
toured widely in the 
United States and 
throughout Europe. The 
score for a film composed 
by Ashish won top awards 
from film critics in India. 
He has taught at his 
father ' s school in 
Calcutta , and in San 
Rafael , as well as for the 
Amer ican Society for 
Eastern Arts In Berkeley, 
University of Washington, 
and the Kinnara School of 
Ravi Shankar. 

Pranesh Khan , Ash lsh 
Khan 's younger brother, 

will accompany him on 
the tabla, and Kamal Shah 
on the tamboura--a 
plucked string instrument 
used as a drone. 

The sarod , originally 
from Afghanistan , was 
developed to its present 
form by Ustad Allauddin 
Khan . The body is of teak , 
the belly is covered with 
skin , and the finger boarct 
is metal . The sarod has 25 
metalstrings,ten of which 
are played with a plectrum 
made of coconut shell. 
Four strings carry the 
melody , two accentuate 
the percussive rhythms 
and four others are tuned 
to the dominant notes of 
the raga being played . 
The remaining fifteen are 
sympathetic strings . A 
metal gourd increases the 
resonance . 

The tabla is the most 
popular two piece drum of 
India. The right hand 
drum-tabla is tuned to the 
toniC , dominant or sub-
dominant. The left-hand 
drum (banya) acts as the 
bass drum and is capable 
of many tones wh ich can 
be var ied by the degree of 
pressure from the base of 
the left palm.

PaciEic Yields InEo On Atlantic 

Deep Sea Drilling 
Completes Leg 32 

Scientists aboard the Deep Sea Drilling 
Project's research vessel, ON GLOMAR 
CHALLENGER reported that evidence 
obtained from scientific drilling in the 
northwest Pacific has contributed im-
portant new information concerning the 
South Atlantic Ocean . The -scientific 
team also gathered evidence leading to 
the conclusion that during the period of 
Earth's history ranging from 115 to 150 
million years ago, there was a world-wide 
doubling of the rate at which new oceanic 
crust was formed by the process that is 
called "sea floor spreading" . 

The announcement came as the ship 
made port in Honolulu at the conclusion 
of Leg 32 last month . 

In explanation, the scientists noted 
that new floor of the ocean forms by 
intrusion of hot, molten rock in cracks 
that develop a.long the trends of 
spreading centers. These spreading 
centers are the major oceanic mountain 
·chains . As the molten rock cools, 
magnetic minerals form and become 
small magnets In the rock , all aligned 
with the Earth's magnetio field . Because 
the North and South Poles have reversed 
their locations many times in the past, a 
magnetic map of the floor of the ocean 
shows numerous bands parallel to the 
central oceaniC spreading centers. These 
bands can be identified and traced in a 
worldwide pattern much like comparing 
tree rings . 

During the cruise just completed, a 
number of holes were drilled which 
established the identity and geologic age 
of several groups of magnetic bands In 
the western Pacific. One of the most 
significant results established that an 
unusual magnetic band In the northwest 

, Pacific corresponds to a ba,nd existing on 
both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. This 
band represents the period of ap-
proximately 115 to 150 million years ago; 
its width indicates that the sea floor 
spread at about twice the normal rate 
during that period. ' 

This evidence also Indicates that the 
opening of the South Atlantic Ocean 
basin can be dated, with new found 
accuracy. to have occurred about '125 to 

130 million years ago. At that time the 
newly formed Atlantic Ocean must have 
looked very much like the Red Sea or the 
Gulf of California of today---a mere notch 
in a major continent. 

Co-Chief Scientists for Leg 32 of the 
DSDP were Drs. Roger L. Larson of the 
Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory 
and Ralph Moberly of the HawaII In· 
stitute of Geophysics of the University 
of Hawaii. The expedition departed 
Hakodate, Japan in August and made 
port in Honolulu on 10 October 1973. In 
conducting the on-site operations , It was 
sometimes necessary to lower drill string 
through more than three miles of sea 
water and ocean floor sediment, a feal 
made possible . by GLOMAR 
CHALLENGER's capability for dynamic 
pOSitioning which is a system for precise 
location and stability above the drill hole 
on the sea floor. 

The ship also cored sediment from two 
broad plateaus riSing from the sea floor 
about 1500 miles east of Japan, 
Recovered samples of fossiliferous rock 
revealed a record of oceanic conditions 
over the past 100 million years. 

Other holes were drilled on or next to 
seamounts in order to date the time 
during which ancient volcanism oc· 
curred . The resulting data has led the Leg 
32 scientific team to believe that volca nic 
activity west of Midway Island, for 
example, ceased about 27 to 30 mill ion 
years ago . Other holes were drilled near 
the Islands of the Hawaiian chain 'wh lch 
has active volcanoes at the southeastern 
'end and Increasingly older extinct 
volcanoes to the northwest. Still farther 
northwest along this track, at Koko 
Guyot seamount, the time of volcan ism 
was shown to be about 50 million years 
ago. 

The next two-month cruise of 
GLOMAR CHALLENGER - Leg 33 - will 
continue this Investigation of the 
relationship the pattern of volcanism has 
had on the character of Pacific sea floor 
movement, as well as the rise and fall of 
volcanic Islands. Leg 33 will leave 
Honolulu In late October 1973 and ter-
minate In Tahiti In early December.

Defecation 
Editor : 
I have a few comments I 

would like to make 
concerning the article you 
ran in this section Oc-
tober 30, 1973, until now, 
titled Satisfaction . 

To the woman who 
wrote the article , I would 
like to say to you, that 
you have taken a bad 
experience with the Black 
man or men you have had 
the displeasure of having 
sex with and generalized 
it in respect to all Black 
men . Your article has only 
suffered the image of the 
Black man sexually to be 
utterly disreputed . Your 
generalizati on was 
completely erroneous and 
unjust to the many Black 
males who would 
superbly fulfill your every 
whim , sexually and 
physically. I myself being 
one of many others , 

I beseech you to retract 
your previous statement 
and justify the injustice 
you have afflicted upon 
numerous Black men and 
women . 

To you the editor I say 
that your printing of the 
article Satisfaction , was 
completely unjustified 
since you have no proof 
the article was written by 
a Black woman , as it was 
signed. 

If by any means you 
obtain this proof, I must 
say you are doing a hell of 
a job to provide UCSD 
students with the lowest 
defecation readable.

m usico.l Notes 

Premlata Fomerla Marconi 
Photos of Ghosts • River of Life ; Celebration; 
Photos of Ghosts; Old Rain ; 11 Banchetto ; Mr. 9 
'til 5; Promenade the Puzzle. 

Speaking of groups you probably haven't heard of 
before, Premiata Forneria Marconi (called PFM for 
convenience sake) is one of the Italian Rock Groups 
now attempting to break into the American Music 
Scene. 

The album is indeed an interesting one. River of 
Life, the first cut of the album starts with an 
acoustic guitar in a sort of classical vein which is 
quickly joined by flute producing a sort of medieval 
sound . Then , organ riff enter in and a modernizat ion 
effect begins to take hold, when suddenly in comes 
a dyamic electric bass and Its hard driving rock 
joined by piano and energy . 

The total effect of the group is that form of 
classically influenced rock made popular by " Yes" 
crossed with the dramat ic progressive unity found In 
early " Pink Floyd" . The addition of violin , flute , and 
piccollo by Maura Pagan i add to the effect , and 
keyboardist Flavio Premoli shows signs of Keith 
Emerson influence whenever he leans into the moog 
synthesizer as in Celebration . 

The only flaw with this impressively instrumented 
group is the vocals on the album . Here, despite trys 
at harmony the lack of a truly developed lead 
vocalist shows the seams in their musical curtain. 
Further, the group is not comfortable in English , 
and the vocals tend ever so slightly to sound 
phonetiC. 

Despite this problem , the band has a strong 
potential for possibly making that difficult 
breakthrough into the American market , with the 
resources they have, if they can concentrate that 
instrumental energy and make it work for them . The 
band is young (average age of the members is 23) 
and still highly impressionable (or so it seems) and 
perhaps their next album will mature into the big 
break they seem to need. 

For now, Photos Of Ghosts offers listening in that 
classic-rock field at a level whjch should be in-
teresting and entertaining, if not totally awe-
inspiring. 
News to Peruse 

Two years after its release in October 1971 , " Pink 
Floyd's" seventh album Meddle has been certified a 
gold record . Encouraged by this and the success of 
recent The Dark Side of the Moon, Capital is 
repackaging the bands two earliest albums, Pink 
Floyd and A Saucerful of Secrets under a two-record 
package entitled A Nice Pair.
