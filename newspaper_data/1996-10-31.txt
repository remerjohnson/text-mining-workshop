hit Roanne Bracks in 
face with hammer 
By Terry Lew 
News £ r 

Roanne Bracks, a 1996 Marshall 
College graduate, awoke early Sat· 
urday morning to the sound of a man 
beating her in the face with a claw 
hammer. 

" 1 heard a really loud noi e ... 
which I found out later wa ' a ham· 
mer hitting my face," Bracks said. 

"1 woke up and I heard omeone 
saying, ·Die. bitch. ", 

Brack , who wa staying at her 
mother's home in Fletcher Hills, 
told EI Cajon police she recognized 
the voicc of Godoy Hale - her ex-
boyfriend. 

Hale, who was a Muir College 
student between fall 1992 and spring 
1996 but left without receiving a 
degree, wa arrestedTue day morn· 
ing on charges of as aull with a 
deadly weapon, burglary, making 
death threats and tonure. 

According to a police source fa· 

mili ar wi th the ca ' C, Hale wa ' 
charged with lorture instead of at-
tempted murder becau e torture -
unlike attempted murder - is pun-
ishable by life in prison. 

California Penal de *206 de-
fines torture as "innicting great 
bodily injury .. . with the intent to 
cau e cruel or extreme pain and suf-
fering for the purpose f revenge, 
extortion, persuasion or for any sa-
distic purpose." 

Hale remains in custody at the 
downtown San Diego entral De-
tent ion Facility. His bail was set at 

500.000. 
Bracks. who lost six teeth and 

suffered deep cuts on her mouth and 
face in the attack, first met Hale at a 
U D cafeteria in February. They 
dated for four months, bUl Bracks 
aid she left Hale when he began 

acting aggressively. 
According to Bracks, Hale be· 

gan stalking her after the breakup. 
He made dozen ' of threatening 
phone calls, ultimately causing her 
to leave her an Diego apartment 
and go into hiding.

The University of California manages and op-

Proposed Surcharge Quietly Dropped from lIe's Table 
FEE: UC officials 
considered timely 
graduation 'incentive' 
By Leena Shankar ' 
Guardian Reporter 

A recent UC Office of the Presi-
dent (UCOP) propo al to add an 
extended-enrollment fee has been 
unofficially dropped from consid-
eration. according to sources close 
10 the initiati ve. The prQPosal 's cur-
rent slatus has caused confusion for 
those invol ved. 

The proposal - Intended by it 
designers 10 be an incenti ve for stu -
dents to graduate in four years -
outlined plans for an additional 
charge of $200 - 1000 per quarter 
beyond the student 'S fourth year at 
any U school. 

UC Provost C. Judson King sent 
a leiter and copy of the dra ft pro-
posalto all the UC campuse ' i n mid-
July. 

UCSD Assoc i ated Student s 
President Co leen Sabatini said she 
opposed the fee increase because 
there are bellcr methods to encour-
age tudents to graduate in four 

years. 
"The proposed surcharge is a step 

that has been taken far too early. 
The first step is to improve aca-
demic advising and class availabil-
ity." Sabatini said. 

"I am very happy that the Of-
fice of the President has dropped 
the fee proposal for this year. but 
the A .S. will be keeping a close 
eye to see if the proposal comes up 
again." 

However, UCOP spokesman 
Mike Lassiter denied that the e/(-
tended-enrollment proposa l was 
ever seriously considered. 

"The Office of the Pres ident 
has ju t heen discussi ng th e pros 
and cons of the proposal ; there 
never was a formal proposal pu t 
out for con iderati on," Lassi ter 
said , 

" At thi s time. there is no time-
table for this proposal coming be-
fore the board, especially since the 
budget proposa l has already been 
e ·tabli shed for the coming year." he 
added. 

According to University of Cali -
fomia Student Associat ion (UCSA ) 
Executive DirectorKimi Lee. UCOP 

"tiler. were many 
dlffer.nt factors to 
be considered In this 
proposal. 111. 
pr~sal needs to 
addr ... stud.nts 
who may be .nt.rlng 
with no Advanced 
Plac.m.nt credit or 
transfer stud.nts 
who have problems 
transf.rrlng th.lr 
credits ov.r into the 
UC system." 

- Georgios Anagnostopoulos 
Chairman 

UCSD Academic Senate Division 

never had formal plan tosublllitthe 
proposal 10 the UC Board of Re-
gent - thc fi nal authori ty on sys-
tem-wide fee increases - for ap-
proval. 

'The Office of the President /in 
conjul1l:tion with the UC campuses l 

considers various proposals that 
come up and then submits some of 
them to the regents," Lee said. "But, 
in light of the fact that the UC sys-
tem has been moving toward 
privatization by increasing fees. it is 
probable that the proposal will come 
up agalO." 

UCSD Academic Senate Di vi -
sion Chair Geo rgios 
Anagnostopoulos said the proposal 
was dropped for various reasons -
although Anagnostopoulos said hc 
has nOl ye t recei ved wrillen confir-
mallon of such a dec ision. 

'There were many different ruc-
tors to he considered in th is pro-
posa l." Anagnostopoulos said 

"The pruposal needs to acdress 
students who may he enlerin.,: wllh 
no Advanced Placement cr ~d i t or 
transfer student s who hay ~ prob-
lems transferring their creuits over 
into the UC system." he added. 

According to Sabati ni. the dra ft 
proposa l also lacked a c lear defini -
ti on of an appeals process. 

"T hl s surcharge has gn:al rami-
fica ti ons for those students who 
are working. those who arc engi -
neering majors. those who have 

double majors. and those who 
l:hange Iheir major during their 
co llege years. I want to see more 
about an appeal process," she 
said . 

A ccording to King 's leller. 
Gov. Pete Wilson ' Compact With 
Higher Education - a four-year 
agreement between the universily. 
the governor and the leg islature 
that guarantees funding for higher 
education if the universi lY fulfill s 
cert ai n commitments - requires

ber of students graduating in four

The UCSO Guardian ~ PUbhshed twIce a week at the unIVerSity of Call1ot0l3, San Otego~ Contents 
01996. 'VIewS eltpressed here.., represef'lt the majOrity volo of the edtlO(lal board. and are not

The Association of Student EmployeeslUnited Auto 
Workers (ASElUAW) is at it again . Continuing a strug-
gle that dates back at least four years, the union of most-
ly graduate students has threatened to go on strike if the 
university does not grant them official recognition and 
the right to bargain collectively. 

Few would argue that teaching assistants and other 
graduate-student academic employees have it easy. That 
is no reason to unionize, however. Graduate-student 
employees have few of the worries th'ar blue-collar work-
ers have, such as job security or retirement benefits. 
Furthermore, as the only supply of labor available on 
campus to fill teaching-assistant positions, they have no 
fear of replacement. 

More importantly, being a T.A. should be viewed as an 
investment in one's education, rather than ajob. An aca-
demic teaching position is a learning experience - a 
valuable part of a graduate student's education on the 
road to becoming a profeSSional or entering academia. 
Considering the temporary nature of lheir stay here, 
graduate students have no reason to view their academic 
teachillg positions as careers. They are here for a few 
years before they move on to bigger and better things. 
They do nor need a union . 

On the basis of these arguments and the fact that they 
already have their own representative organization, the 
Graduate Student Association, the Guardian encourag~s 
members of the ASE/UAW to vote against a strike and 
eease demanding recognition from the university. 

VcnIaIism of 'b.., 
Materic-ls Hurts Everyone 

It seems fairly obvious that the average student here at 
UCSD spends an exorbitant amount of time in the con-
fines M a library: Whether it's Geisel, Undergrad or any 
of the others. students here constantly avail themselves 
of the libraries and the resources contained therein . 

Some students, however, can't seem to control their 
infantile impulses for destruction when they are inside 
these hallowed halls of academia. Each and every day 

book~, magazines and newspapers are defiled by people 
who tear out pages. rip out pictures and write their own 
moronic thoughts over the words of the authors. 

There are only three reasons why a person would 
damage library materials, and not one of them is justifi-
able. First. there arc those who disagree, either politically 
or morally, with the content of the materials . These folks 
take it upon themselves to censor the offending material, 
as the rest of us are obviously far too stupid to make our 
own decisions about what we should read or see. 

Secondly, there are those competitive people who wish 
to monopolize necessary class materials to give them-
selves an unfair advantage on an assignment. It doesn't 
mailer how much you want to get into medical school -
screwing your classmates by sabotaging necessary 
resources is unconscionable. 

Finally, there are those who are just too cheap to 
spend a few cents on making a 'copy of the pages or arti-
cles they want. If this is your problem, come find us and 
we'll lend you a quarter. 

In a perfect world. these people would all be gathered 
up and smacked severely fottheir impudence. We all 
depend on being able to access the materials in the 
libraries for research, assignments and our own intellec-
tual enjoyment. Those who vandalize library resources 
inconvenience other students and f.cully for their own 
selfish ends.

MODERN PRESIDENTS LACK 
WASHINGTON'S CHARACTER 

COMMENTARY: Today's political candidates don't stand up under 
scrutiny, but the real issue is whether they can get the job done 

B r e n t

Smells Like 
The Truth 

"George, what happened to 
the cherry trcc'!" 

"Uhm." 
··George .. ... 
After only a moment's hesita-

tion - less than a second. really 
- George squares up hi s shoul-
ders. takes a breath, and an-
nounces: 

"Father. 
cannot tell a 
lie ..... 

And so the 
myth goes. 

Not much could sully the charac-
ter of George Washington. At a time 
when constituents looked upon 
politicians with more respect than 
derision, Washington eommanded 
the adoration of a nation. Everyone 
knew "everything" there was to 
know about him, and more. 

After the Revolution, 

candidate not only has to deal with challenges of the 
present, he has to contend with his entire life. Where 
myth protected Washington from scrutiny, modem pres-
idents deal with records, allegations and even myths -
nasty, uninspiring myths - of his past. 

The result is that a man's life is exposed to a world 
ready to criticize the smallest blemish. However, presi -
dents and hopeful contenders have more than "small 
blemishes" - they have outright hypocritical, shame-

ful. ugly life clIperiences, as does 
everyone. 

Welcome to the modem presi -
dential campaign, as much a cruci -
fixion as it is a determination of the 
nation's leadership. 

More often than not, the crux of 
the crucifixion relies on questions of 
character - as if character ever 
determi ned whether or not president 
did an acceptable job. Character 
never prevented an able president 
from acquiring a second term. 

Washington headed the new nation's 
potentially most potent political 
force - a veteran army. A man of 
lesser stature may have aspired to 
empire. Washington. however, gave 
up his commission. 

The myth is even more endear-
ing. Washington was a soldier who 
never feltJear in the face of bailie; a 
planter who never aspired to be any-
thing other than an honest fanner; a 
boy who, despite inevitable punish-
ment (whIch never materialized), 
owned up to his actions. 

For some reason, 
politicians think that 
"good character" Is

Americans. yet they

for a man who is second only to 
Wa hington in America's heart. 

Such examples can't compare 10

6 OPINION 

GEORGE: 
Continued from paC. 4 
Soviets, and it woriccd. 

For some reason, politicians 
think "good character" is important 
to Americans, and seem to forget 
that Americans have had over 200 
years to gct used to presidents of un-
Washingtonesque proportions. 

Woe is Bob Dole - his allack on 
President Bill Clinton's character is 
falling on deaf ears. 

Clinton does not have the char-
acter of Washington. No president 
ever has or ever will. So Americans 
look for results - economic results. 
]s it any wonder that people, having 
lived through rece sions more often 
than not over the past 16 years, 
elected Clinton despite his character 
naws? Clinton onered change, Bush 
offered trickle-down economics. 

Now. Dole is faced with dethron-
ing a president under whom the 
United States has gained expanded 
Irade. rising wages and an unem-

ployment rate of 5.1 percenl - the 
lowest in six years. 

Dole initially tried to convince 
people that the national deficit is an 
impo sible burden, and that he 
could balance the budget by CUll ing 
taxes by 15 percent, a ridiculous, 
radical proposition. But had 72 per-
cent of the nation not felt good 
about the condition of the economy, 
according to a New York limes/CBS 
News September poll, Dole may 
have gained some VOles. Instead, he 
has f ai Icd miserably. 

With the United States experi-
encing a secure peace and prosperi-
ty not known since before World 
War I, it's no wonder Dole has 
tUl"Jled to the only avenue available 
to him - character attacks. 

Thus, Clinton is rer..eiving illicit, 
if not illegal, foreign funding. 
Clinton is hiding potentially damag-
ing evidence concerning his 
Whitewater involvement. Clinton 
promised to run the most ethically 
responsible administration in hist(}-

ry, and now half his SlatT has either 
been fired or is in jai I. Et cetera, et 
cetera. 

If citizens are happy under their 
current president, if the perceived 
results of the president are more 
than satisfactory, then Americans 
will re-elect Bill Clinton. People 
Ii kc results - they don't care how a 
president comes by them. 

When you're five years old, you 
grow up with the myth of 
Washington and suspect that a per-
son can't be president unless he 
somehow emulates him. But as we 
deal with our immediate concems in 
the increasingly ugly reality of poli-
tics, Washington falls further into 
the realm of myth. 

There is no doubt that Clinton is 
less than honest. Dole, for thaI mal-
ter, can not claim Washington's 
legacy. However, we need to make 
our presidential selections by deter-
mining who will preserve our secu-
rity, nOl by deciding ~ho has.impec-
cable character.

LLNL: uc 
spokesman denies 
any wrongdoing 
Continued horn pale 1 
tory . universi ty and government 
policy." Schwoegler said. 

According to the internal audit, 
LLNL personnel unde rcharged 
some federal agencies while over-
charging other agencies by compa-
rable amounts during the period of 
September 1990to May 1993, while 
conducting work on 279 approved 
projects for 15 federal agencies. 

The audit also showed that LLNL 
had failed to return unused fund. 
upon the completion of a number of 
projects. 

" Public institutions such as 

LlNL must maintain strict care and 
accountability of public funds since 
they have a public tru t and respon-
sibility to do so," U.S. Attorney 
Michael Yamaguchi said. 

Although laboralOry personnel 
violated official policy, Schwoegler 
said the switching offunds was done 
because resources were not imme-
diate ly available - and researchers 
wanted to get their work done on 
time ratherthan put projects on hold. 

"The completion work was per-
formed for the benefit of the federal 
government, with the understand-
ing that additional funding was in 
the pipeline," Schwoegler said. 
'There was no wrongdoing on the 
part of the lab." 

However, Assistant U.S. District 
Attorney Anne-Christine Massullo

"Public Institutions 
such as LLNL must

of public funds since 
they have a public

responsibility to do 
so."

U.S. Attorney 

said the U.S. Department of Justice 
approacht<d the irregularities as a 
civi l-fraud case. By transferring 
overrun costs from one project to 
another. LLNlofficials violated the 

federal False Claims Act that pro-
hibits the filing of false claims or 
statements with the governmenl. 

"When money is earmarked for 
certain purposes by the federal gov-
ernment, you cannot use that money 
for anything else," Massullo said. 

However, the university main-
tains that as a whole, the federal 
government did not lose any money. 
In addition, no laboratory employee 
gained personally from the transac-
tions. 

Following the di scovery of the e 
accounting discrepancies, the uni -
versity paid the federal government 
$700.000 in 1995. 

However, Massullo said the Jus-
tice Department felt it needed to 
further review the extent of the mis-
managed funds. Its investigation 

" Thursday, OclOber 31,1996 

uncovered unauthorized loans be-
tween unrelated project accounts and 
poor documentation in many of the 
fil es. 

As required by federal law, the 
Justice Department gave the univer-
ity an opportunity todi scuss a settle-

ment before filing suit on behalf of 
the government. 

The agreement between the Jus-
tice Department and the university 
was based on findings from LlNL's 
1993 internal audit. as well as find-
ings from the federal inspection. 

The $2.7 million consists of the 
$700,000 the university gave to the 
department in 1995. an additional 
$800.000 for misallocaled and un-
documented funds, and $1 .2 million 
in damages - whi ch includes 
$200,000 for auditing and legal 
costs. 

According to Schwoegler, the 
money for the settlement will come 
out of the UC's managemenl-p,!!r-
formance fee - funds the univer-
si ty receives from the government 
for managing the labs. 

The government allocates a per-
formance fee each ycar- 6.6 mil -
lion for the 11)96 fiscal year - and 
sets it aside for claims or miscella-
neous expenditures incurred in the 
operation and management of the 
lab . lfnoclaimsare liled.themoney 
reverts to the labs' discretionary re-
search fund. 

To prevent a si milar recurrence, 
LLNLofficials have created 26 cor-
recti ve measures - 21 of whieh are 
already in place. 

"The remaining fi ve will bccom-
pleted by the end of this fi sca l year,"

The Associate Paradise -Lost 
Comedy tackles duality 

By Alii Macisaac: 
Crime explored in documentary 

Staff Writer 
The Wall Street world is taken 

by storm in "The Associate." 
Financial analyst Laurel Ayers 
(Whoopi Goldberg) 
devises a plan to create 
a fictitiou s partner, 
"Robert S. CUllY, "who 
happens to be a middle-
aged white male. This 
clever plan is inspired 
by the ract that Ayers 
lost her promotion to a 
pretentious white male 
who she graciously took under her 
wing. Unfortunately, Goldberg is 
double cast as Ayers the corporate 
whiz and CUlly, her male counter-

part - destroying the small 
amount of credibility the film 
actually had. 

The idea behind the film is 
intelligent, but it loses its self-

respect the moment 
Laurel Ayers decides to 
dress up as her "partner" 
and continue on her 
quest to the top of the 
financial world. 

Goldberg looks like 
Ben Franklin on a bad 
hair day with a gallon of 
pancake and too much 

eyeliner. Miraculously, she pulls it 
ofr, and everyone believes that 
"Roben CUlly" is real, despite the 
fact that he looks sub-human. 

Associate: Whoopi Goldberg 
takes on dual role in new film. 

Frank. (Tim Daly) is the only 
person in the film who sees through 
this theatrical affair Ayers is per-
forming on Wall Streel. He devises 
a si lly plan that draws attention 
away from Ayers for a moment, 
while he maneuvers to become the 
new financial god. 

Fonunately, Whoopi Goldberg 
is a comedic actress with tremen-
dous talent, because without her, 
thi s film wouldn't have made it to 
the theaters.

Drama often obscures reality, but

mutilation-slayings of 
three eight-year-old boys

Continued from page 12 
clivities - deemed aberrant by the 
predominantly Christian town -
they are convenient scapegoat. and 
ultimately, the accusations leveled 
at the youth seem to involve preju-
dice more than definitivc evidence. 

The filmmakers began to role 
their camera as the suspects waited 
for trial. The nonfiction tory unrav-
els before the viewer in a coherent 
narrative structure that the editors 
crafted in a one-and-a-half year 
post-production period. As events 
moved along, Berlinger and Sinof-
sky conferenced and reviewed 
footage they had captured, anticipat-
ing the types of "scenes" they want-
ed to rel.:ord in order to drive the nar-
ration from a cinematic standpoint. 

During the shooting, the crew 
was careful to remain unobtrusive 
while recording the lives of the sub-
jects. They were able to record the 
mutual hatred resonating between 
all the panics involved. One scene 
depkts a victim's father engaging in 
target practice on a pumpkin while 
rattling off a venomous diatribe of 
vengeance for the accused teens, 
and anOlher reveals an outburst of 
resentment for the victims and their 
families by one suspecl's girlfriend. 

"Paradise Lost" does nOl spare 
the-abject - it opens with actual 
crime footage of the bodie found tiy

BIG FISH: 
Third-wave ska 
reaches new levels 
ContInued front PICe 10 

In an interview with lhe 
Guardian. Reel Big Fish trumpet 
player Tavis Werts discussed lhe 
band's newfound success and slar· 
dom. and new album (which was 
produced by John Avila. of Boin-
go). 
....... : How did,. pya 
... picked up by ,,1 

Werts: John Feldman from 
Goldfinger came to a show we 
were playing with the Skeletones. 
and he really liked us and wanled 
to use our hom players for the 
Goldfinger album. So he got in 
touch with a couple of us. and lold 
their record label guys about us. so 
we basically gol hooked up through 
them. 
What AI )'011 do cHHerentIy 
on T,." the Radio ON from 
your tint album? 

Well, the recording quality 's a 
lat better. A lot of the same songs 
from Everything Sucks but they 
were recorded a lot differently, a lot 
more tighter. It ·s just a lot more 
professional-sounding album. 
Is your · tour schedule still 
hectic? 

Oh yeah , it's pretty hecti c. We 
just got back from a six-week tour 
of the U.S. wi th Let's Go Bowling 
and Cherry Poppin ' Daddies. both 
really great bands that we like a lot. 
We ' re leavi ng in two days to go on 
tour wi th the Toasters and 'the 
Aquabats around Hawai i and a 
bunch of other cities on the East 
Coast. Hawaii's actually one of the 
first places where we' re starting to 
get a lot uf radio airpl ay. They have 
a radio station there ca ll ed "Radio 
Free Hawaii" which is based 
ent irely on requests. 
Are your songs still about 
strictly "macho" stuff, like 
chicles and beer? 

Yep, they' re all pretty much 
about girls or being a rock star. 
Aaron (the lead singer) writes all 
the lyrics. but he clai ms to be a lot 
happier now, so I don ' t know what 
his new songs are going to be like. 
I. all the attention the 
band's receivinc now .over • 
......... ? 

II's been really overwhelming. 
We just gOl back from our first real 
nalionallour. and now it's like we 
really need to sil down and gel a 
handle on thi s. We released the 
song "Everything Sucks" as our 
first single and we did a video for 
it. and il was on MTV's " 120 Min-
utes." 

The ~udden fame thing 's pretty 
much taken all of us by surprise. I 
mean, you know we were just a 
small Orange County band for so 
long . But lhen we didn' t have a lot 
of ways 10 gel the band enough 
exposure. Gelling on the "Misfits 
of Ska" compilalion (on Dill 
Records) did us a lot of goOd. 
because il was shipped and distrib-
uled all over lhe country. After il 
was released, I slarted gelling e-
mail from kids all over the place. 
That's when a lot of people started 
picking up on us and we slarted to 
tour in different pans of the coun· 
try. 
Do you wMi to ... R_ 
ala FIsh &WI • bfc • No 
Doubt or Qul.elr? 

Oh yeah. RiJlll now. we're still 
not really mllku. any money from 
il. and we've aII_ our day jobs

Michael Collins 
Irish revolutionaries take on English 

By DlIYe Yen 
Guardian Reporter 

Irish rebels and nationalists 
clash with the English and 
amongst themselves in Neil 
Jordan's hi storica lly 
accurate. but lack-
luster epic "Michael 
Collins." 

Liam Neeson 
plays Collins. a vio-
lent Iri sh revolu· 
tionary who desires 
to achieve peace 
through non·vio-
lence (notice the 
contradiction). Collins. in an 
allempt to free Ireland from 
the reign of England. forms a 
terrorist organization. 

On the other side of the 

spectrum. British forces retali-
ate against innocent Irish citi-
zens. including in the film's 
best scene. randomly di patch-
ing spectators and participants 

at a soccer game. 
This hloodshed con-
ti nues even after 
Coll ins negotiates a 
treaty with the 
British. The treaty 
fails to guarantee 
complete Iri sh 
autonomy and 
divides the republic 
between Collins' 

rebels and the Irish nationalists 
and their leader Eamon De 
Valera (Alan Rickman). 

The fundamental problem 
with "Michael Collins" is that 

nothing is ever thoroughly 
explained. Scenes come and 
go. but no one really knows 
why. Somewhere in between. 
he manages to develop a rela· 
tionship with Jul ia Roberts 
(Kitty Kiernan); thus. the ever-
'o-predictable love triangle 
fonm between Coll ins, Kier-
nan, and Collins' best friend 
Harry Boland. played 
remorsefully by Aidan Quinn. 

La t year "Brave heart" 
tackled a similar theme. about 
a courageous patriot who 
fought bravely for indepen. 
dence against a tyrannical 
Engli sh empire. You ' re beller 
off renting that movie rather 
than wasting your money on 
"Michael Collins."

I would be thc 20-year-old

pursue his true ca lling In life: 
golf. But Tiger is no ordinary 
golfer - just ask Nike. 

That's right. Tiger Woods 
"just did it ." and has not onl y 
taken the NCAA and the 
Amateur Golf Association by 
storm. but he is the newest 
dynamo on the ProfeSS ional 
Golf A soc lation Circuli . And 
he isn' t even old enough to buy

So, as the Nike commercial 
asks, is golf ready for this? 

Oh yeah. Wood~ has

Monday night 's 
road game at Occi-

" It did not swell up on Tuesday 
morning, so Ihat was a good sign," 
Oceguera said. "And il has gotten 
a 101 better in the last couple of 
days, so I'm hoping thai I won ' t 
need Ihe MRI on Friday." 

"The [Occidenlal playersJ were 
hacks," junior midfielder/forward 
Lauren Johnson said. "They tried 
10 injure us and they got to Cela. 
They would not even shake hands 
at the end of the game." 

The Tritons entered Monday 's 
contest with a 14-1 record and the 

top ranking in the nation. The de-
fending NCAA National Champi-
on inc reased their winning streak 
to eight games, en route to record-
ing their 13th shutout of the ycar. 

The Triton tifling defense was 
at its best Monday night . keeping 
posse sion for most of the contest. 
Lisa Wilkinson. Beth Freeburg and 
Oceguera dominated from the 
back. creating numerous opportu-
nities for the potent UCSD of-
fen c. 

Senior midfielder Toni Nunez 
began the scoring halfway th rough 
the fi r I half with her sixth goal of 
the year. 

"We struggled fo r the fi rst 15 
min utes ," seni or fo rward Elc 
Johnson said . "They had an off-
side trap on, but we gOlto the m. It 

wa~ weird because one of goa ls 
was on a slope. so you had to shoot 
at an ang Ie." 

Lauren Johnson, UCSD's lead-
ing scorer, added to her season 
total with her 17th goal of the 
campaign . Along with her goals. 
"Scorin ' Lauren" has found time 
to contribute nine assists. upping 
her total to 43 for the year. 

Alison "Burley" Hurley as-
sisted on the next Triton goal .

highest-paid PGA player this 
year. not counting his promo-
tional earnings of over $60

could net him a couple more 
million. Not bad for a college 
dropout. 

And the way Woods' fans

I bet mo t UCSD men's occer 
fans were unaware that hi story un-
folded before their very eyes yes-
lerday, amid the wind and rain of a 
winter-like storm. 

Yesterday was the first time in 
UCSD men ' s soccer history that a 
game has been canceled due to 
atmospheric conditions. Pretty im-
pressive, eh? 

Unfortunately, history is the 
least of the Triton' worries. With a 
record of IO-S, UCSD' top prior-
ity is its lasl lame of the season 
alainsl Division I UC Irvine and 
lhe upcomina playoffs. 

"If we would have won thi 
game, we would have definitely 
made it to the playoffs," senior 
forward Nate Hetherinlton aid. 

So far this season, the Tritons 
have lost only one game to a fel -

low DiviSion III team, fifth-ranked 
Ri chard Stoc kton (NJ). T heir 
record versus Di vision III foe, 
coupled with their quality sched-
ule. gives eighlh-ranked UCSD a 
good chance of competing in the 
post-season. 

Yesterday 's game. how-
ever. which would have 
matched up the Tritons with 
Claremont College, will not 
be rescheduled. This may 
be a surprise. because the 
Mustangs were to be the fi-
nal Di vision III competition 
for UCSD. And a good 
showing for them against UCSD 
could have solidified their hopes 
of earning a playoff spot. 

"If we would have won, we 
would have been a shoe-in for a 
home seed," Triton Assi tant 
Coach Ted Przybylek aid. "With-
out this game. we stiJI have a good 

chance of befng in the playoffs. 
and maybe still a game at home." 

The team faces a few obstacles 
on the road 10 the playoffs, though. 
First and foremost. UCSD will 
travel north to Orange County to 
bailIe Di vision I foe UC Irvine on 

Sunday night at 6 p.m. 
"This game isextremely 

important because of our 
winlloss situation ," 
Przybylek said. "[UCI] is a 
Division I school and is 
doing half decent. It is our 
advantage that we play 
them last , though. UCI 

plays against Division I teams all 
year long and so they are usually 
tired, and we'have beaten them the 
last couple of years." 

Also. the Tritons' game against 
the Anteaters will be only their 
second game in two weeks. This is 
vital to UCSD' playoff perfor-

mance because it gives the tea m 
time to prepare for the big-ga me 
situation. 

"We always get rea lly up when 
we play a Divis ion I tea m." 
Hetherington said. "We' ve been 
running a lot and practicing hard. 
The only difference is the inten-
sity in a game is different than in 
practice." 

If the Tritons do make it to the 
playoffs, whom the Tritons will 
face in the post season is still up in 
the air, as well as where any games 
will be played. But UCSD hopes 
to have a better result than last 
year' s loss to Chapman in over-
time. 

"Any team in the playoffs is a 
very good team," Przybylek said. 
"There are no easy games in the 
playoffs and if you can win five 
games, you are the national cham-
pions."
