Watson Takes Fifth 

Shockley Appointed 
Provost at Third 

Noted physicist and humanitarian William Shockley 
has been appointed the new Provost of Third College it 
was announced today in Berkeley. 

President Hitch made the announcement yesterday 
only three days after joseph Watson, the former provost 
of Third was named the Provost of the new "Fifth 
College", the School of Penal Sciences. 

In making the announcement Hitch said "I am quite 
sure that Bill Shockley will continue the fine tradition of 
Third College and the excellent work of its former 
provost joe Watson ." Hitch did say however that 
Shockley will be encouraged to test his theories and that 
"Third College is probably as fine a laboratory as a 
scientist studying in his field could find ." 

Shockley the former Nobel Prize winner in Physics 
has gained fame in recent years for his works of 
genetics. Although skeptics have doubted the validity of 
his theories on the inferiorities of blacks compared to 
that of whites as a whole, most members of the 
academic community have applauded his provocative 
and stimulating studies in a field which was formerly the 
realm of crusty old "New Deal" type liberal biologists 
who drearily paraded the half baked notion that en-
vilonment was more important than the individuals 
genetic background . 

Shocldey said he was generally satisfied with the 
programs of study at Third College but that "studies of 
genetically inferior cultures and societies should be 
abandoned." 

The new Provost said that "I am investigating the 
po sibility of starting a department of Domestic 
Sciences and starting next year Third College will offer a 
degree in Sanitary Engineering." Arrangementj ha. 
already been made with the Sanitation Department in 
San Di go for a co-operative educational program .

the building should be ready by the milennia." 

Bananas Make Appeel 
(la jolla) In an exclUSive 

interview on KSDT's "The 
Record Show", the for-
mation of the Banana 
liberation Front (BlF) was 
announced last week by 
Randolph, the World's 
largest Banana. 

Randolph, largest 
(rp'}Ntpnlv 42 fp .. t) of t~o 
bunch ()f baii ,! rl_ 
demanding fruit reform told 
KSDT Djs Rick Anderson 
and larry Deckel that he 
was "Sick and tired of 

seeing bananas treated as 
sex symbols ."

then it didn't happen.

Piranhas and Pyramids: 

Work on Third Starts 
Plans for the construction 

of Third College were 
finalized last week at a 
meeting of the Regents in 
San Francisco . Construction 
began immediately after 
the announcement was 
made. 

According to the Ar-
chitects in charge, Third's 
Architectural plan will 
"emphasize the many 
myriad culture's which the 
programs of Third College 
attempt to deal with ." 

The Dormitories will be 
constructed in the center of 
a Piranha infested pond 
(complete with Anopheles 
mosquitoes). The dorms 
themselves will be made 
out of Bamboo, and will be 
placed on stilts in the 
center of the pond . 

Some regents expressed 
concern that the plan 
provided for no boats or 
rafts to transport the 
Students to and from their 
on-campus residences . 
However , these were 
denouced by the majority 
as " non-repressive." Some 

Four-in-One 

of those in the majority also 
described the pond as "the 
latest in home security. If 
there were boats the 
protective effect of the 
Piranha would be im-
mediately negated." 

The classroom buildings 
will be an even greater 
architectural triumph , the 
planners contend. Adobe 
huts, Navaho hogans, and 
Tibetan stone pagodas will 
characterize the main 
features of the classroom 
buildings. 

The "fete-a-tete" as the 
planners call it, will be 
Third's unique Commons : a 
one-half scale replica of the 
Great Pyramid of Giza. It 
will feature sunken 
passageways, secret en-
trances and exits, and the 
cafeteria will be housed in 
an underground replica of 
King Tut's tomb. 'We think 
a Commons should be 
fun", the Planners and 
Regents agreed.

University Fills Quota 

Improvement in Cafe. Food Noted 

The claim stems from a 
long time practice of 
equating bananas with 
phallic symbols and a 
recent event in which 
Randolph's wife Chiquita 
was raped (her yellow 
leotards carele~sly .. tr .. wn 
.lway( an<1 blten in pubhc. 
Randolph attributes this 
casual attitude to the sexual 
associations that have long 
time been cast to banan.as. 
"You don't see people 
picking on apples" said 
Randolph, "they claim they 
keep the doctor away. And 
who ever dares cast 
allusions to oranges? And 
they're as perverted a pear 
as there's ever been ." 

Vice Chancellor Paul Saltman announced today that 
UCSD had fulfilled the affirmative action guideltnes 
instituted by the federal government, and henceforth 
only White American males would be considered for 
faculty positions, With an emphasis on Jews. 

Saltman explained that the UCSD department average 
had been greatly improved when the recently created 
Afro-Asian-latin-Indian-American Studies Department 
had lured a Black, American-Indian woman with a 
Spanish surname 

Dr Harvey Mudde, 
Chancellor of the UCSD 
Uti lities service (CUC-
DUS), today told reporters 

at a press conference in 
downtown Revelle that a 

~ewer main had broken 
under the Revelle cafeteria 
three weeks ago. It was 
discovered yesterday when 

can of radioactive 
Iracer" waste was flushed 

down a USB toilet . 

Dr james Bugger tells 
thiS story: "Well, we flushed 
It down as sort of a joke. We 
were teaching med students 
the basics of tracing 
samples throuRh the blood 
tream. So, as a practical 

demonstration , we sent a 
small, neutral-bouyancy 
container with 'hot' cobalt 
in it through the pipes and 
gave out geiger counters to 
the students. Imagine our 
surprise when we trailed it 
going into the cafeteria area 
but not out of it! We just 
hope the canister remained 
intact." 

Ironically, most students 
who eat at the Revelle 
Cafeteria were of the 
opinion that the qualtity of 
the food during the last 
three weeks was better than 
averaae. A few, however, 
wondered if the main has 
been broken 10nRer than Dr. 

Medinl School Nobel LAure.t", On. Wilhelm von ! tost and Fritz von Spitz cIemonttr ...... 1heir new "Iri ..

"jawohl". HMfted Dr. von TlOIt, ''fHen D •• DriHe 
~ch could not ~U"'llct. mit uns." 

Mudde claims. The first 
week of fall quarter was the 
date most often put forward 
as the time of breakage. 

When told of this rumor, 
Dr. Kruse, Director of the 
Institute for Applied Food 
at Revelle (DIAFR), hotly 
denied it. She claims that 
the plastic-lined paper bags 
taped underneath the 
cafeteria chairs are there to 
allow students to take out 
food. She closed the in-
terview when reminded of 
the ten dollar fine for this 
unlikely act. 

Dr. Mudde professed his 
belief that the repair work 
being done by Drs. Mc-
Carty, Soto, and Hinton will 
be finished today. McCarty, 
Soto, and Hinton are 
members of UCSD's 
Utilities Service Work Crew 
for Fixing Broken Sewer 
Mains (YCSDUSWCFBSM).

"Since she counts as four mtnorities," 5altman aid, 
"and the department only has two facu lty members, this 
department is 200% minority, which meets government 
requirements." The other faculty position in this new 
department has been filled , but Saltman would not 
confirm rumors that the appointee was obel Prize 
winning novelist BortS Pasternak.

Fairest of the Fair Contest 
DEL MAR - Locations, dates and times of 21 

remaining area Fairest of the Fair contests have been 
announced by the Southern California Exposition, 
sponsor of the annual county-wide competition to 
select a queen to reign over the Expo during its "June 21 -
July 4 run . 

Winners take part in the Fairest of the Fair Pageant on 
June & at the Scottish Rite Memorial Center in San 
Diego. 

Preliminary contests have already been held' at 
Pacific Beach, Spring Valley, National City and La Mesa.

and will appear in promotional events at the fair. The 
Fairest of the Fair will receive S500 in cash and prizes 
valued at S1,500. 

Engineer Shortage Ahead 
A seemingly unavoidable shortage of engineers is 

building for the years ahead in most engineering fields . 
The shortage, already being felt, is boosting salarie~ and 
leading to more job security. The future demand for 
engineers should remain strong for at least this decade 
and probably beyond. 

What has been a buyer's market for the last several 
years, is turning around again for those who possess an 
engineering degree. Employers are stepping up their 
efforts to find good graduating engineers to the tune of 
5% increases or more in salary offers since the end of 
last year. At the Master's level, the number of job offers 
rose 40%. Competition is also strong for the still 
relatively few women and minorities graduating in 
engineering and technological disciplines. 

The engineer who is flex ible about job opt ions may 
also find she/he is in demand for other kinds of em-
ployment such as management and techn ical sales. 
Furthermore, since there is considerable flexibility 
among curricu la and degree, employers can draw on 
engineering graduates from related fi elds when there is 
a shortage of applicants in the fie ld of fi rst choice.

Entrepreneurs· Needed ... ~ · 
One type of oraanization UCSD has all 

too few of is the student business. Many 
reasons for this have been asserted, but 
no one really seems to know why. SE~ is 
determined to try to locate the rare breed 
of daredevil-the UCSD entrepreneur. 
Any lead will be followed to locate 
members of the species. Harvard and UC 
Berkeley students have for decades 
produced successful businesses that are 
sold or willed to underclassmen by 
graduating seniors. The types of en-
terprise attempt~ can range from -the 
Simple one- or two-person business or 
partnerships up to complex cooperative 
associations and corporations with 
boards of directors and employers. 

Immediately, SEO has business for the 
following types of workers : bartenders, 
pet sitters, caterers, chauffeurs, con-
valescent aides, house cleaners, painters, 
readers, tutors, sales persons, and pilots, 
etc., etc. SEO is willing to explore any 

possibility with students who are in-
terested in developing their own business 
in those areas mentioned above or any 
others. 

Setting up student business is hard 
work and it takes dedicated people to be 
successful. Nonetheless, the en-
trepreneural risks are balanced by the 
high profits possible in successful 
situations. Salaries for entrepreneurs 
would have to be paid through the 
earnings of the business as no funds are 
available at this time from the university. 
Students interested in such endeavors 
should contact Eric Martinez, Bldg. 215 
Matthews Campus or Judy Manternach, 
Bldg. 210 Matthews Campus, or call ext. 
1936. Ideally, ideas should be written up 
and submitted to Mr. Martinez prior to 
discussion of the project. 
"Those who organize, manage, and 
assume the risks of a business or en-
terprise-Webster's.

Campaign Starts for June Primary 
by James C. 5010 

Over the past two or 
three weeks we at the Triton 
times have been receiving 
mountains of political 
literature relatinl to the 
upcoming June 4 primary 
election in Califomia. So for 
the Spring Quarter we 
would like to present some 
of the important in-
formation to the voting 
public so that you might 
better decide who you 
might vote for . This column 
will not be an editorial type 
piece but rather a news 
column with what we hope 
will be practical insights 
into the political world of 
the upcoming election . 

Who Gets It? 

We plan to concentrate 
on statewide offices 
especially during the first 
part of the quarter. Em-
phasis will be on the 
gubanatorial primaries for 
the two parties. When the 
filing deadline was up three 
weeks ago it was an-
nounced that 31 people had 
submitted their names as 
candidates . Although a 
final list was not available 
by press time you can be 
sure that this election will 
have a top number of 
qualified and strong 
candidates for all the 
parties. 

Candidates for the 
democratic nom ination 

include Baxter Ward, Los 
Angeles County Supervisor 
and former broadcaster; 
Bob Moretti, Speaker of 
the State Assembly; William 
Matson Roth, a University 
of California regent; Ed-
mund C. Brown Jr., 
California Secretary of 
State; Jerome Waldie, 
member of the House of 
Representatives, and Joseph 
Alioto, Mayor of San 
Francisco. 

In the Mervin Field 
California poll, highly 
regarded among political 
experts in the state, Brown 
is the impressive fron-
trunner with approximately 
46 percent of the vote 

Meeting for Married Student Housing 

Single graduate students, post doctoral 
fellows and medical residents are among 
the groups that are asking the University 
to house them in either the Coast or 
Mesa married student apartments . 
Because. of the ever increasing demand 
for a limited number of apartments the 
Housing and Food Service Advisory 
Committee is asking for student opinion 
on several issues concerning the married 
student apartments. These issues in· 
cl ude: 

2. Should there be a maximum time 
limit for occupancy? Various suggestions 
include one or two years for all students. 
If this policy is adopted how would its 
implementation affect students currently 
living in married student housing? 

1. To who should priorities for housing 
in married student apartments be given? 
One proposal would give first priority to 
married students with children. Second, 
and equal priority would be given to 
married students with no children and 
Si ngle graduate students , on a first come 
first serve basis . Another proposal would 
gIve all students - single graduates, 
ma rr ied students with or without 
children - equal priority. 

3. How can administration of the 
apartments be made less subject to 
abuse? There is a widespread feeling that 
use of the apartments has been abused. 
Students have sublet their apartments to 
nonstudents for extended time periods; 
people have remained in the apartments 
beyond termination of their students 
status. etc. 

A Housing and Food Service Advisory 
Committee meeting will be held Thur· 
sday, April 4 at 1 :30 in the Revelle South 
dining hall. The purpose of this meeting 
will be to hear student opinions con-
cerning the above issues. All interested 
persons are invited to attend and give 
their suggestions. 

Early Job Assistance 
The demand for certain kinds of goods and services 

continues to grow. The energy crisis is creating new jobs 
and establishing -different priorities. Better jobs and 
more promotional opportunities are increasing for 
women and minorities . 

It is a myth that the job market is rigid and static . On 
the contrary, it happens to be a fluid arena where 
people are mobile: occupations are changed on an 
average of five times during a lifetime. It is also flexible 
enough for people to be enterprising: over a third of 
today's graduates probably will end up working at jobs 
that have not yet been invented. 

Education has a potent value in the society, but the 
relationships between it and possible work en-
vironments often need to be more clearly understood, 
particularly in the rapidly -evolving occupational 
scence. Thus, in order to help students still at UCSD 
gain gretlter freedom and flexibility as they make 
dec isions about future jobs, a pair of workshops 
focusing on the student-job relationship will be offered 
by Career Planning and Placement this quarter. 

The relationship between student tlnd job is first seen 
on the student side in the Occupational Survey 
Workshop. where students look at their occupational 
Interests, goals, and priorities, and lay a groundwork for 
future job hunting. The workshop should especially be 
taken by tudents early in their college careers . The job 
side of the student-job relationship is examined in the 
Job-Seeking Techniques Workshop, as it concentrates 
on job-hunting procedures and strategies aimed at 
helping students locate potential employers, approach 
them, and present themselves with confidence. 

Each workshop will consist of exercises, lectures, and 
discussions; will have three meetings; and have limited 
enrollment .

among those who have 
decided whom they are 
going to vote for . Mayor 
Alioto is second with 20 
percent and Morretti is 
third with 14 percent . 
However in a poll taken by 
the Roth campaign, Brown 
had slipped to 41 percent, 
while Morretti and Alicto 
had also fallen slightly. 
Roth and Waldie had 6 
percent and 5 percent 
respectively. While it is 
obvious that Brown is the 
strong frontrunner, Moretti 
and Alioto have started to 
swing their campaigns into 
high gear. 

William Roth has been in 
the local spotlight lately as 
he opened his San Diego 
Campaign headquarters in 
an abandoned gas station. 
Alioto has been the most 
obvious of the candidates 
in San Diego with ap-
pearances every week for 
the past month. Baxter 
Ward and Roth have been 
applying public pressure 
towards Brown for public 
television debates. It looks 
I ike the Democratic 
campaign will be a free 
wheeling affair with lots of 
fireworks . 

The Republicans have an 
interesting matchup with 
Lt. Governor Ed Reinecke 
and Controller Houstan 
Flournoy as the candidates 
with the ma jor media 
coverage . Their campaigns 
have not yet become as 
act ive as their democratic 
counterparts but it looks 
like it should be tight race. 

Reinecke has had some 

.gen'l admission $2.50 
UCSD students ':.50 

problems relating the ITT 
affair but he seems to be 
fighting just that much 
harder to erase any doubts. 
At first he was thought to be 
the natural successor to 

.Covernor Reagan but then 
Reagan said that he was 
going to. be neutral in the 
campaign. As a result some 
of the money that probably 
would have gone to 
Reinecke went to Flournoy. 
Flournoy seems to be the 
stronger candidate in a 
general election because of 
his popularity among in-
dependents . Reinecke 

. however is very strong 
among traditional 
Republican voters as was 
evidenced last week by his 
endorsement by the 
California Republican 
Assembly (CRA), a con-
servative grass roots 
organ i zation . 

Although Senator Alan 
Cranston is very popular 
throughout the state his bid 
for reelection has attracted 
a number of Republicans in 
an attempt to unseat him. 
His most prOrT'inent op-
ponent probably won't be 
able to run against him. S. I . 
Hayakawa, of San Francisco 
State fame was recently 
denied a chance to ,un in 
the republ ican primary 
because he switched his 
party reg istrat ion f rom 
Democrat ic to Republi can 
too late. Republ icans who 
are running include James 
Johnson, a former Assistant 
Navy Secretary , State 
Senator H. l. Richardson, 
and Dr. Earl Brian. 

We also plan to cover 
important statewide offices 
as they provide interest to 
the University of California 
and any propositions that 
may arouse the voter. 

Local races will be 
covered if they have any 
interest and several of them 
look like they just might 
provoke a few heated 
debates . As usual the 
County Board of Super-
visors continue to exe~ 
themselves in the process of 
who can throw the most 
mud. My own prediction is 
that there will be some 
lawsuits before the year is 
out against one of the 
supervisors. 

It is hoped that this 
column will give broad and 
fair coverage to all the 
candidates in the races we 
cover.

Minority Editorial 

Regents Duplicity 
, 

In their meeting of March 15, 1974, the University 
of California Regents voted to scold Goodyear Tire 
and Rubber for makIng an illegal contribution of 
40,000 dollars to the reelection campaign of Richard 
Nixon. While the Regents and .the govemment 
profess this sort of activity to be illegal as well as 
undesirable, their actions indicate exactly the 
opposite. The government has resorted to 5 000 
dollar fines of companies which contributed as 
much as 100,000 dollars, and Nixon has even 
returned a large part of the money to those who were 
caught (and subsequently "confessed".) The 
Regents, who hold 347,000 shares of Goodyear 
stock worth 6.1 mi Ilion dollars, voted in conjunction 
wlt.h management NOT fo fine the top company 
?fflcers who made the contribution, and also NOT to 
institute a policy of firing officers for similar 
behavior in the future . Regent Carter justified these 
actions on the basis that an opposite vote would 
have "~n adverse reaction against that company as 
far as Investors are concerned ." 

The real message from the regents to Goodyear is 
clear: they do not disapprove 01 the actions of 
Goodyear, and they implicitly encourage these 
actions in the future . The signers of this editorial 
abhor these actions of the Regents , which clearly 
demonstrate that if Watergate has taught them and 
U. S . industry anything , it Is only to be more careful 
in their illegal activities . 

We also note, that in the true spirit of affirmative 
action of the university, the Regents voted with the 
management of Goodyear against the demand of 
so":,e stockholders that the company issue a report 
on Its employment practices towards worr.en and 
minorities.

Open Letter 
Dear President Nixon : 
I heartily urge you not to 

resign the office of 
President under any cir-
cumstance. Though the 
evidence against you 
appears to be damaging and 
overwhelming, I hope you 
fight this thing through to 
the very end. 

Even if the House of 
Representatives should 
impeach you, I urge you to 
hold your ground and, not 
buckle under. Stay in there 
and fight! let it go to the 
Senate and challenge that 
august body to convict you . 
Do you think they would 
dare? 

If the House is squeamish 
about impeaching you, you 
can imagine how loathe the 
Senate will be in going that 
one fateful step beyond and 
carrying out your political 
execution . It will be a first 
in American history . They 
will be setting a very 
dangerous precedent and in 
the process will go down in 
infamy as the king-killer 
Congress . It will mean that 
this legislative body. with a. 
mere flick of the wrist, can 
keep or dispose of any 
future President as it sees 
fit; I don't think the 
Founding Fathers quite had 
this in mind when they 
wrote the Constitution. 

However, if the Senate 
sh<?uld find you guilty, still 
don't give up. Fight on! 
Refuse to leave the White 
House; barricade the doors 
to the Oval Officel You, not 
Jerry Ford or anyone else, 
were lawfully and over-
whelmingly elected by the 
people of these United 
States to be their President. 
Don't let anyone ever take 
'it away from you. It's yours, 
not their's . 

Of course if they do send 
in the marines to get you-
those unpatriotic ingrates-
you' ll have to give it up. We 
certainly don't want any 
more law-breaking and 
violence . Perhaps you 
could sacrifice yourself on 
the altar of what you 
believe in , as President 
Allende did just recently in 
Chile and become a martyr 
to the cause, but that of 
course is up to you . 

Some may claim that 
such an ordeal will tear the 
country apart and 
wrecklessly undermine the 
very foundations on which 
the Republic itself stands. 
Ignore such warnings . Be 

firml Hold your ground! If it 
should come to that, then 
so be it. let the chips fall 
where they may. Unleash 
the furies . Fight for what 
you believe in; don't give 
an inch. Perhaps it's about 
time we have a good 
shaking up. Certainly we 
will be much stronger and 
better for it afterwards. 

Just remember Mr. 
President that what's good 
for the country isn't 
necessarily good for the 
coming Revolution . Do the 
Revolution an incalculable 
service and stay in there no 
matter what the outcome. 
You and only you alone, 
remaining and working 
within the system can 
subvert it far more 
thoroughly than a whole 
army of revolutionaries 
ineffectually attacking the 
citadel of government from 
without. History has ap-
pointed you the advance 
assault troops of the 
Revolution . Don't let her 
down now in this, your 
finest hour. You have a 
rendezvous with destiny. 

You're a fighter, Mr. 
President. Slug it out to the 
last man. Don't let them 
hound you from the highest 
pinrfclcle in the land. Hold 
onto it with your life! 

All Power to the People!

Soto, Again 
By Malcolm Smith 

In" A Defense of 
Colonialism" (T.T. Feb . 22) 
Mr. James Soto takes a 
rather unimaginative stand 
as an apologist for existing 
fact, using arguments that 
harken back to the days of 
jingoism and the poorly 
disguised racism of 'White 
man's Burden". This should 
not surprise us, as Mr. Soto 
holds political views that 
are more appropriate to the 
19th century than to the 
20th . It is unfortunate that 
Mr. Soto fails to rise above 
the " tired mediocrity" 
which he deplores in the 
Marxists. 

Examples are sited of 
failures of newly 
established governments to 
progress toward "economic 
and political stability", 
presumably of the type 
enjoyed by the nations of 
the western world; Greece 
and Hitlerian Germany are 
fine examples of this 
stability. The nations of 
Africa did not evolve as did 
the nations of Europe,

TheSLA 
Introduction by Mason Powell 

The Symbionese liberation Army has recently been in 
the news due to the kidnapping of Patricia Hearst. In 
spite of the fact that Ms. Hearst goes to a branch of U. 
C. and that the SlA has made complete publication of 
its communiques a necessary condition to the woman's 
safety, no mention of the kidnapfing has appeared in 
the Triton Times. Furthermore, al Southern California 
newspapers have published incomplete, misleading, 
and distorted reports; the television on this issue of 
course remains the boob tube. and only radio station 
KPFK (90.7 on FM radio), whose sister station KPFA in 
Berkeley received the initial communique from the SLA, 
has given the subject complete and unbiased coverage. 
(KPFK is, in fact, the best news source in Southern 
California and broadcasts the news nightly at 6 p.m.) 

What follows is part of a transcript from General Field 
Marshal Cinque sent to Randolph Hearst on February 
21, and published in the San Francisco Examiner on Feb. 
22. It is hoped the readerw ilt now be able to form a 
slightly more informed opinion of the SlA. However, 
due to the inherent nature of Southern California's "free 
press," one is forced in this case, and actually in many 
other cases, to listen to KPFK radio to learn what is 
happening. 

To those who bear the hopes and faith of our people, 
let the voices of their guns express the words of 
freedom . 

Greetings to the people, comrades, sisters and 
brothers, General Field Marshal Cinque speaking. 

The Symbionese War Council, the Court of the 
People, has just finished hearing tapes and hearing 
some of the new.; reports and statements made by the 
Hearst family concerning the arrest of Patricia Campbell 
Hearst. 

In the court's second tape by Patricia, it was said that 
any good faith gesture on the part of the Hearst empire 
would be basically OK. 

We, however, understand that Patricia wants to come 
home, as soon as possible and that this statement was 
clearly misinterpreted as meaning that an untrue 
gesture of good faith and regret would be accepted by 
the people. 

This is not the case and, therefore, at the end of that 
tape stated by Patricia, I myself, by the direction of the 
court, stated the feeling of the court and thereby 
clarifying the request of the people. 

That statement reads as follows : 
"We wish to clarify what your daughter has said about 

our request by a good faith gesture on your part . The 
people are awaiting your gesture. You may rest assured 
that we are quite able to assess the extent of your 
sincerity in this matter. And we will accept a sincere 
effort on your part . 

" We are quite able and aware of the extent of your 
capabilities as we are also aware of the needs of the 
people." 

The Hearst empire has attempted to mislead the 
people and to deceive them by claiming to put forth a 
good faith gesture of S2 million . 

This amount is not at all a good faith gesture but 
rather is an act of throwing a few crumbs to the people, 
forcing them to fight over it amongst themselves . 

We have had a court hearing concerning both the 
actions of the enemy Hearst family and the Hearst 
empire as a whole and the media and the combined 
responsible gesture of good faith . 

We have chosen first to expose a sampling of the 
extent of the Hearst empire which includes the Hearst 
Foundation, the Hearst Corporation empire. and Mr. 
and Mrs. Hearst's personal assets . The assets of the 
Hearsts' wealth include the following : 

1. A silver mine and thousands of acres of land in 
Mexico, acreage in Hawaii, and 70,000 acres of tim-
berland in Northern California valued at millions of 
dollars. A cattle ranch near San luis Obispo, orange 
groves in Florida, a duck club and rice paddies outside 
of Marysville, Calif. Small land holdings and homes in 
Hillsborough, New York and San Diego. Each valued at 
well over one-half million dollars . 

2. Personal stocks. large interests in IBM, Beatrice 
Foods, Ex)(on, the Sugar Bowl Corp ., and Safeway stores, 
United Airlines, and Hughes Airways. And huge 
holdings in drug companies, ore industries, paper 
companies, lumber companies and cattle ranches.

3. Miscellaneous personal items. A collection of 

antique paintings, Chinese screens and Greek vases. 
Twenty-four vases each valued at S10,OOO each . A 
collection of Oriental rugs given to him by his personal 
friend, the Shah of Iran. The family has also received 
numerous gifts over the year5 from other long-time 
personal friends such as Ho~ard Hughes. 

The Hearst Foundation is a front for the Hearst for-
tune. The foundation serves as a tax loophole for that 
fortune. The foundation donates an estimated S3 
million a year to established charities to maintain its 
legal status as a foundation . The S1 .5 proposed to be 
comi ng from the foundation is nothing more than half 
of what that foundation is legally required to donate 
annually in order to maintain its foundation status. 

The assets of the Hearst Corp. have been stated many 
times. However, I will restate them again as some 
specific factors . As we all know, the Hearst Corp. is 
composed of a chain of magazines and newspapers. 
However, I wish to point out two specific ones as 
examples. Cosmopolitan magazine reaps profits of $7 
million to S8 million per year . Another is House 
Beautiful, which reaps profits of S3 million to S4 million 
a year . The Hearst Corp . is also composed of as 
mentioned before, a chain of TV stations and fe~ture 
fi lm industries and also ownership of lumber companies 
and partnership in large stockholdings in General 
Motors as well as land holdings in each of the cities 
where the newspaper chains operate: for example, 
ownership of one square block in New York City, with 
the land alone valued in hundreds of millions of dollars 
as well as land and buildings in England and Australi~ 
and Europe. 

In total, the Hearst empire along with Mr. and Mrs. 
Hearst's personal wealth does in fact go into the 
hundreds and hundreds of millions . 

Even if Mr. Hearst was to give all that to the people, 
with the personal friends such as the Shah of Iran and 
Howard Hughes he would suffer no losses. 

However, even if Mr. Hearst were to give all of that to 
the people, he cou ld never pay the people back for the 
past losses of their children and freedom , nor for the 
current suffering they are now under. 

We also wish to point out that when necessary the 
enemy can adjust its losses to correspond to its interests 
at any given time. 

It is in the direct interest of Mr. Hearst to comply with 
the demand for food . Not because he finds it necessary 
to feed the people but rather because he must secure 
and protect one of his possessions - his daughter, 
Patricia . Thus, he finds a way to change the proposal 
(the tape voice is garbled at this point; it sounds like "of 
the assessable laws" or "acceptable laws") which allow 
him to distribute the charitable rather than ransom 
goods . 

In the same vein with the stated enemy. corporations 
wish to aid such countries such as South Africa, the 
Phillipines, South Vietnam or Ireland in securing brutal 
dictatorships which rob and murder the people. No 
existing laws are honored and no one responsible goes 
to prison for the rest of their lives. This is typified in the 
Watergate scheme and the U.S. deliberate violation of 
the United Nations sanctioned international embargo of 
Rhodesian goods. 

On the other~hand, any time the interests of the 
people are at hand there is an enemy law to counteract 
th~se Interests and of course the people are forced to 
abide by them. In understanding this we cc.. ne to 
understand why the U.S. has more ~risons and the 
largest numbers of laws to control the people that has 
ever been recorded in the history J)f humans on this 
earth. 

These laws are created to imprison the people and by 
that protect the rich from the poor. ' 

It is in the judgment of this court that the Hearst 
family and the Hearst Corp. seems to be more foolishly 
concerned with the identities of supposed SLA elements 
rather than with the admission to the people of the 
crim~s committed against the people by the Hearst 
empire. That act of good faith (following is unclear on 
tape - "in its - showing") to the people, not to the SlA 
.- the Hearst empire should demonstrate a change of 
Interest, .r~gret for his crimes against the people and a 
firm deCISion that they will no longer be a party to such 
actions in the future . 

They shoul? also d.emonstrate that they are not only 
concerned with freemg and making a better life for 
Patricia but also freeing and making a better life for all 
of the people. However, they have seemingly said by 
their actions that they know me and therefore do not 
have to repent for their crimes. 

However. to this I would say yes. You do, indeed. 
know me. You have always known me. I'm that nigger 
you have hunted and feared night and day. I'm that 
nigger you have killed hundreds of my people in a vain 
hope of finding. I'm that nigger that is no longer just 
hunted, robbed and murdered. I'm the nigger that hunts 
you now. 

Yes, you know me. You know us all. You know me. I'm 
the wetback . You know me, I'm the gook, the broad, the 
servant, the spik. 

Yes indeed, you know us all, and we know you - the 
oppressor, murderer and robber. And you have hunted 
and robbed and exploited us all. Now we are the hunters 
that will give you no rest. And we will not compromise 
the freedom of our children. 

Death to the Fasci st insect that preys upon the life of 
the people.

Well, according to the philosophies of the various 
editors and contributors to the volume (this is issue 
number 1 with more to bilow, success willing) they 
"Look forward to the day when people will no longer 
look upon the human body with disgust, shame or fear, 
but accept it as it is, and for all its worth '" They preach 
that the naked human body is not erotic, but rather it is 
clothing and strip-tease philosophy that makes us 
believe it is erotic. 

So the book tells us all the places around the country 
where you caD stop being a "c1othist" and become a 
nudist. It also has a number of articles concerning the 
history of nudism , V. I. B. (vacation in the buff) 
vacations, and coverage of the Miss and Mr. Nude 
America and World pageants . 

My complaint with all this fine sounding liberated 
philosophy is this . If the book is so concerned with 
changing this falsified image nudity has gotten, why 
then are they using yellow-press sensationalism and 
seemingly attempting to attract the porno voyeur?? For 
example : one article in the volume concerns one 
Wendy Zellea Berlowitz who feels that "clothing is 
irrelevant. It doesn't matter whether you have clothes 
on or not ." To prove this, she removes her blouse in 
public, auctions it off, and then gets arrested for in-
decent exposure and challenges the constitutionality of 
the law. Now ignoring the sensationalism of all this, 
there is sti ll reason to believe that this is a sincere at-
tempt to e levate the human body. So be it. However, 
consider how the editors of Clothes Free handle the 
story. First off, the interview is entitled "Wendy's secret 
weapons" (sound at all like something you'd find in the 
back of a seedy bookstore?) and on the back cover they 
spout "Travel with Wendy as she takes her top off from 
Norman, Oklahoma to the East Room of the White 
House. Exclusive classroom photos not available 
anywhere else in the world," (Yes, Wendy is a teacher) . 
And you should see these picutres . Talk about strip 
tease philosophy. The sliding down the thighs of pants , 
panties, and so on . If the statement of these photos is 
supposed to be "the human body is beautiful , not 
eroti c" then somebody is kidding . No, they're not 
eroti c, but they're sure trying to be. 

All right, the book does do what it sets out to do, at 
least to the extent of providing a comprehensive li sting 
of nearly every nudist camp in the U S. and Canada, but 
it's the hypocrisy that seems to float around the book's 
philosophy which strikes me The book in some senses 
ought to offend a true philosophical nudist, and is 
certa in ly a dissappointment for voyeurs, despitf> an 
advertising air designed to draw them in, so one can 
only judge its merit on its puported accuracy con-
cerning the "nude scene". Be your own judge. Here is 
their e ntry concerning our very own Black's Beach . 

"BLACK'S BEACH : Over 3,000 persons daily have 
been reported at this beach , most of them nude . It's 
located about 110 miles south of l. A. on Interstate 
Highway 5 in La Jolla. Take the Genesee Avenue exit 
from the San Diego Freeway. Go West on Genesse for 
about a mile to North Torry Pines Road, continue south 
about a mile and turn right on La lalla Shores Road . Go 
a little more than a mile to Discovery Way Park in 
Aquarium Museum lot. Walk north to end of lot down 
path to beach . Past rocky point that juts out is begin-
ning of 'Free Beach.' Water and beach cleaner about 3/4 
mile further down ." 

Look out folks, here they come!

Concerts: 

The San Diego Sports Arena 
eats rock groups and never cries. 
And its latest victim of acoustic 
distortment was "Yes", who 
played against the Sports Arena 
last week during finals. 

Hearing a concert at the 
Sports Arena is closely akin to 
placing your stereo in the toilet 
and listening to records w)lile 
flushing, and yet it is the only 
place we've got with the size to 
handle the big name concerts. 
So we all buy our tickets, get 
frisked at the door, and try to 
keep the best frame of mind we 
can . 

That night marked one of the 
rare times that a concert in the 
Sports Arena started on time 
(remember last year's "Yes" 
concert when they finally came 
on at Midnight?), and to make 
up for this success, they started 
off by announcing that John 
Sebastian would not appear as 
scheduled. Sigh . In his place 
appeared Charlie Starr (it could 
have been Ringo Starr and it 
wouldn't have fully made up for 
Sebastian's absense) who played 
electric guitar and sang all by 
himself, and went from dull to 
nearly interesting in the course 
of his tastefully brief set . 

Now I was ready. The stage 
full of outrageous setting, the 
green blobs, the dragons head 
engulfing the percussion 
equipment, the whale bones, 
the blue tunnel, the tower over 
the whole mess loaded to the 
brim with lighting instruments. 
In comes the Firebird Suite, and 
with it "Yes," picking liP right 
where they left off last year by 

YES 
playing the entire album 
to The Edle. As always, 

remains a knock~ut. 
music is so lushly complex 
could almost swoon . While 
play it Close to the 
they've matured enough 
they can go out onto 
tangents and play more 
and freely than ever before. 
Wakeman particularly · 
more willing to let go and 
barrage of keyboards say 
piece. 

However, the 
complex nature of Close 
Edge was lost to the 
Sports Arena, and in 
hearing five instrum en 
each blending to make a 
we get the whole whole in 
resounding chaotic 
Rounds one to the Sports 

After setting the mood 
"Yes" proceeded to 
nearly its en,tirety their 
epic Tilles of TuOlv .. ".,

vantage. The lighting

and synthesizer solo which 
wrenched the sports arena to its 

very limits as the dragon's head 
splits in two, blossoming like a 
great fl ower, whale bones 
psychedelically flashilJg red and 
darting back and forth, death 
heads projecting, lights 
thrQbb ing, strobes appearing, 
smoke filli ng and engulfing the 
interior of the dragon head, the 
drums, the stage . Everybody's 
jaws Simply dropped. Round 
two to "Yes". 

Back out for the encore. 
Closing night excitement fills 
the stage as it's the end of seven 
weeks and 40 concerts on the 
road for the band and crew. 
Roundabout and 5tarship 
Trouper, both crowd-pleasers 
and played with as much energy 
as I've seen them done. Four 
naked groupie-streakers h it the 
stage, the crew throws confetti 
the crowd th rows " Yes" ~ 
balloons, and its no contest. 
"Yes" wi ns two out of three falls 
and the Sports Arena can only 
offer a parki ng lot jam up as its 
final sore-loser tactic . An ex-
Citing evening of theatrical 
concert-going with some of the 
finest musical work the current 
rock scene has to offer. 

Side note: 
Caught "Steely Dan" at I . )'S 

Saturday night and as mobbed 
as it was, the worst and most 
uncomfortable at J.j's is better 
than the best at the Sports 
Arena . Dan's set was too short 
but really solid, and local band 
"Glory" shows signs of real 
Potential. J.J's continue to 
become one of San Diego's 

concert halls .

FUSION, Mich~el Ur~niak - Columbiil 
KC32852 

The sound of Fusion is a distinctive 
blend of typically Eastern European 
sca les and rhythmic materials with the 
contemporary improvisational music 
found primarily in Western jazz. The 
resultant music that Michael Urbaniak's 
sophisticated, highly talented quintet 
creates is at once both unique and 
familiar, i.e . that despite its ethnic in-
fluences, the music 's chordal and har-
monic basis is very reminiscent of that 
heard in the recent recordings of, jlmong 
others, Herbie Hancock and Eddie 
Henderson . The sum of this album's aural 
setting of well-conceived, well -
performed layers of diverse and con-
trasting timbres and textures comprises 
certainly one of the most auspicious jaZl 
debuts in recent years . 

R~ted: bcellent 

THE ATKINS-TRAVIS TRAVELING 
SHOW, Chet Atkins and Merle Tr~vis -
RCA APL 1-4479 . 

While this album certainly doesn't 
fulfill its theoretical promise (teaming 
two country music's finest guitarists) it 
neYe! really disappoints . What it is, is 
essentially a low-key thirty-minutes of 
casual country-pick in', and for this 
listener, an LP of satisfying unpretentious 
entertainment. 

R~ted: Good 

THAT'S WHAT I AM HERE FOR, Roy 
Buch~nan - Polydor P06020 

Undoubtedly, Roy Buchanan is a 
superlative, consistentiy exciting rock 
guitarist, one of the best, and this album 
is simply f~r superior to his previous two 
efforts . Unfortunately, the album's 
production and mix are as tasteless as 
before and his "new" band shows high-
quality ~ band class but no belter. In 

All Ears 
personally appropriate of settings 
alone. Very nice. 

Rilted: Excellent 

KISS, Kiss - C~5ilblanCii NB 9001 
. There's a very manufactured, kind of 

Moby Grape, atmosphere about this 
band . "Live" they emit a very, very well-
rehearsed understanding of the most 
superficial elements in rock (i .e . 
redundant rhythmic and chordal 
structures, banal lyrics and repetitive 
"no-technique" solos), and this, their 
debut LP is at best a well-produ.ced 
reflection of that same simplistic polish . 
Straight off page one of " How to have a

NATURAL BOOGIE, Hound Dog 
Taylor and The Houserockers-Alligator 
4704 

This tight set of Chicago-style good-
time boogie-blues is a suitable follow-up 
to their excellent debut LP released in 
1973. 

Natural Boogie is made up of" Hound 
Dog originals, traditional pieces and 
Elmore James tunes ("H~waiiiln Boogie", 
"fillk To My Bilby") used as showcases 
for either Taylor's raunchy slide guitar 
lines or second guitarist Brewer Phillip's 
fine flat-picked leads . While admittedly 
there's really nothing new here, the 
album's enthusiasm "is" quite con-
tagious, and the musicianship is first-
class throughout. In all, a worthy 
acquisition for any blues fan .

Because of the emminent

the Obscure Sports 
Department has decided to 
make Crew the focus of this 
week's article. 

Crew is the oldest in-
tercollegiate sport in the 
United States. Competition 
in the sport began way back 
in 1852 with a race between 
the crews of Harvard and 
yale. Since then the sport 
has grown tremendously, 
now over 100 colleges and 
universities compete in 
regattas held all over the 
country.

have. Shells range from working out off of the

well as Varsity competion . necessary to win races is 

A typical eillht oared time lost from studying, 
shell is about 60 feet in which as we all know is of 
length and weighs in the 
neighborhood of 250 
pounds. Being as light as it 
is for its size the shell is very 
fragile . The hull of the boat 
is only 1/8" thick. The seats 
are supported by an 
elaborate framing system 
within the shell which also 
provides rigidity for the 
boat. 

Crew is one of the most 
demanding of all sports. It 
requires a lot of time and 
energy from those who 
participate in the sport. This 
is one of the problems that 
Coach Bill Gebur has faced 
in trying to build a highly 

prime importance, 
especially here at UCSD. 

This year Coach Gebur 
hopes to field two com-
petitive shells. 

The Varsity Four should 
be fairly strong, having 
three experienced oarsmen 
in the shell. The boat will be 
coxswained by Sue Glick-
man, with Morgan jotinson 
in the stroke seat . Mike 
glass and Mark Akeson 
return trom last years frosh 
four to hold the middle two 
seats in the shell. Tom 
Eckstein rounds out the 
Varsity shell . 

The Frosh Four is quite 

inexperienced and has had 
its problemsjn getting a set 
boat . At present Larry 

Snowd~n is the coxswain, 
Tim Finnilan is in the stroke 
seat, with Richard Smith, 
Grady jones and Dave 
Gutzler in the 3,2 and bow 
seats respectively. 

The Crew Classic itself 
will commence the rowing 
season on the west coast. 
The Classic will begin at 8 
am with the single sculls 
and finish around noon 
with the featured Varsity 
Eight race. 

The Varsity Eight 
competition should be 
outstanding . Crews 
spotlighted in the race 
include last years Classic 
and Western Sprint 
champion, Washington, 
Navy, always a power in 
Crew, and the University of 
Wisconsin, the 1973 In-
tercollegiate Rowing 
Association champion. 

All the races will begin at 
the northern end of Mission 
Bay, near the Catamaran 
Hotel and finish just past 
the Bahia Hotel on Bahia 
Point . Good viewing 
locations can be found on 
Santa Clara Pt., EI Carmel 
Pt. , and near the finish line

Abalone Regulations For 
The Deep-Sea Poacher 
by Bert Kobayshi FISHING REGULATIONS 

pertinent to your foraging 
for dinner. All frustrated lobster 

divers have been eagerly 
awaiting the opening of 1) You must have a current 
abalone season that started - 1974 sport fishing license 
March 16. And now that the (S4.00). 
season has finally arrived, 
the following may be a very 
necessary item for the 
prospective Ab consumer. 

Due to the revisions of 
the rules and regulations 
covering Abs that occured 
over the past two years, 
there is a need for a recap 
of the 1974 CALIFORNIA 
FISH AND GAME SPORT 

AIDA 
Is comln. 

April 13 

2) North of Yankee Point 
(in Monterey County) 
SCUBA cannot be used; 
south of Yankee Point 
SCUBA is allowed . 

3) Open season is from 
March 16 through january 
14 

4) limit is five Abs in the 
combination of all species. 

5) Minimum size 
measured in greatest shell 
diameter; Red Abs : 7 in-
ches; Green, Pink and 
White Abs : 6 inches; Black 
Abs : 5 inches; all other 
species 4 inches. 

6) Abalone irons must be 
straight, or with a curve 
having a radius of not less 
than 18 inches (such as 
irons made from 
automobile leaf springs-in

curve), and must not be less 
than 3/4 inch wide nor less 
than 1/16 inch thick . All 
edges must be rounded and 
free of sharp edges. Knives, 
screwdrivers and other 
sharp instrumehts are 
prohibited . (This is a new 
regulation this year. The 
reasoning behind this 
change stemmed from the 
non-coagulating nature of 
abalone blood, which 
resulted in a high mortality 
rate of "shorts" due to 
injury from cuts . Divers are 
cautioned to learn to judge 
a legal abalone and not pop 
a "short" so as to minimize 
the risk of injury even 
more.) 

7) Abs must be brought 
ashore above the high water 
mark in such a condition 
that the size can be 
determined. Such Abs not 
in their shell may not be 
transported or possessed, 
except when being 
prepared for immediate 
consumption . 

8) Fishing hours: half-
hour before sunrise to half-
hour after sunset . 

9) Yqu must carry a 
device which is capable of 
accurately measuring the 
size of the Abs taken . 

When you are finally 
successful in locating and 
securing a limit of Abs, but 
don't know how to clean 
them or otherwise prepare 
them for consumption, call 
Bert (ext. 2285) or any Sea 
Deucer Divemaster for free 
advict: . 

Good Luckl Oh yeah , the 
best spots to find Abs are in 
the Bird Rock vicinity.

.nswer to Selected Shorts, 

All- Americans Next Year? 

Congratulations to Jerry (Sic) Colt and Paul 
Trainer. who were both named to the USIU AII-
Opponent Team, which was selected by members of 
the USIU basketball team. The All-Opponent first 
team was dominated by players from USD and 
league winning Azusa-Pacific. 

UCLA Chokes on Vegetables 

In more basketball news, UCLA is hereby awarded 
the All-America Choke award as they somehow 
managed to throwaway a seven point lead in the 
second five minute overtime and twice blew eleven 
point leads, the last with six minutes to go in the 
game, as North Carolina State picked up a free ride 
into the NCAA Basketball Championship, as they 
defeated the Bruins, 80-77. 

The Big Melee Finley Shafted--
Twice 

San Diegan Ken Norton must be congratulated 
and awarded the Muhammed Ali/Cassius Clay 
Mouth of the Month Award for his great publicity 
campaign and downright lousy bid for the 
heavyweight boxing crown of the world, as George 
Foreman handily disposed of Norton with a second 
round KO. 

Also the "Chicken of the Year" Award goes to 
Muhammed Ali , who after calling a press conference 
to announce plan for his bid for the heavyweight 
title , and prediction of Foreman 's downfall at the 
hands of Norton , decided to make himself scarce 
and ski p the scheduled press conference. 

Turning to baseball , Mrs. Charly Finley is 
awarded the " Mothers of Invention Necessity" 
Award, as she finally did what no other person has 
been .able to do - get rid of Gharley Finley . Mrs . 
Finley is now filing for divorce and has a court in-
junction preventing him from going home. 

The " Boob" of the Year Award goes to Charley 
, Finley , who signed up Herb Washington , a 

professional 60 yard sprinter, as a pinch runner, and 
hired Maurey Wills for a week to teach his new 
aquisition how to steal bases, only to find out that 
instead of sliding into bases , Washington bounces 
over them . 

1M Basketball Champs 

Finally , the congratulations of all who par-
ticipated in any way, shape or manner in the UCSD 
intramural basketball program to the top three 
teams in the 1974 Winter quarter leagues. The 
winners were: ON who beat the BANG GANGERS

Pilge 11 Triton Time5, April 2, 1974 



The Triton Times Wastebasket 
Each day, the Triton Times receives reams of 

gritty material from University of California, San 
Diego, the UCSO Extension, and all of the UC 
system's other crude manifestations. All this stuff 
comes in the form of ' news' releases, and all of itl 
begs to be ignored. 

However, because there accumulated a par-
ticularly Impressive mass of the garbage over 
spring break, when no one was looking, we have 
decided to run it all at once and be done with the 
blight. So here. 

"Spring Wildflowers-How to know Them": Sure 

Spring wildflowers and beekeeping will be the topics 
of two classes University of California Extension, San 
Diego will offer starting in April. 

"Spring Wildflowers - How To Know Them," to be 
held Saturday mornings in San Marcos, will be taught by 
Wayne P. Armstrong, who is a botany and biology 
instructor at Palomar College. A foremost authority on 
Southern California plants, he will show participants 
how to identify spring wildflowers brought out by the 
rains as well as the useful, edible and poisonous plants 
of the area (Poison Hemlock, for instance, grows 
abundantly in San Diego Cou"ty). 

He will lead the class on field trips to a recently 
burned area, a creosote bush scrub community, a 
"disturbed" coastal streamside plant community, a 
vanishing coastal salt marsh, as well as to riparian 
woodland, a mountain meadow and a yellow pine 
forest. 

First class meeting is April 20, 9 a.m. to 12 noon, in 
Room LS-2 of the Life Science Building at Palomar 
College in San Marcos. Carpools will be arranged for 
field trips. 

A practical use of wildflowers and other flowers will 
receive attention on 10 Thursday evenings, beginning 
April 11 . Rodman Miller, a Ph .D. candidate in the 
department of Biology at UCSD, and an experienced 

We Certainly Hope So 

University of California President 
Charles J. Hitch state<. :'Jday (March 27) 
that fair and adequate 'iaries and fringe 
benefits are the Univt: y's first priority 
in seeking budgetary au, nentations this 
year Hitch 's statement wc:s made before 
a subcommittee of the A~ I ,bly Ways 
and Means Committee meeting in 
Sacramento 

He stressed that he and his staff will 
work with the Legislature" ... so that opr 
employees-whether professors or 
secretaries or custodians or librarians -
are not in effect penalized because they 
work for the University of California." 

Hitch stated that the Governor's 
budget includes a request for a 3.7 
percent increase in staff personnel

Beekeeping," 7 to 10 p.m. each Thursday in Room 1117 
of the Psychology and Linguistics Building on UCSD's 
Muir Campus. 

California is among the high volume producers of 
honey in the United States, and this country is the 
leading producer of honey in the world . Yet the ancient 
art of beekeeping still lends itself as a one-person oc-
cupation, whether for supplementary income or 
pleasure.

whenever one of them miikes a firey stiitement, 
someone from his office is there to write it down,

Conservatives and Libertarians: 
How to Know Them 

The growing national 
attention being given to 
conservative thought, and 
the effect conservatism 
could have on future 
national policy, will serve 
as the background for a 1(}' 
part lecture series begin-
ning Tuesday, April 2, at the 
University of California, San 
Diego. 

Some of the nation's 
leading proponents of 
conservatism and liber-
tarianism, including John 
Hospers, Libertarian Party 
candidate for president in 
1972, and M . Stanton Evans, 
Jr ., editor of the In-
dianapolis News, are 
cheduled to take part . 

The lectures will begin at 
7:00 p.m. each Tuesday 
through June 4 in Room 
2722 of the Undergraduate 
Sciences. Building on the 
Revelle College campus at 
UCSD. Cost for the series 
is 551 .00 with three 
academic units being of-
fered through UCSD Ex-
tension . Those interested 
may attend the first lecture 
for free . If they wish to 
continue, they may sign up 
for the remaining lectures 
at that time. 

The series is under the 
direction of Dr. Daniel Orr, 
Professor of Economics at 
UCSD, and is being un-
derwritten in part by grants 

from the Fred C. Koch 
Foundation and the 
National Endowment for 
the Humanities. 

Modern American 
conservatism varies widely 
in its doctrines and tactics 
and even the word "con-
servatism" has no simple 
definition. For the most 
part, conservatives share a 
strong suspicion of 
government activity , 
particularly in the 
economic sphere, and view 
schemes for the perfection 
of society with considerable 
skepticism. 

Of recent interest, 
particularly among 
students, is libertarianism, 
an offshoot of con-
servatism . libertarians 
oppose government in-
trusion not only in 
economic affairs, but also 
in what they regard as 
matters of personal liberty 
and conscience such as 
abortion and draft amnesty. 

Hospers, director of the 
school of philosophy at the 
University of Southern 
California, will open the 
series on April 2 speaking 
on "Libertarianism : 
Philosophy and Program ." 
Evans, who serves as 
chairman of the American 
Conservative Union, is 
scheduled to speak on "The 
Media in a Free Society" on 
May 14.
