UCSD Freshman 
Dies in Fall at 
Blacks Beach 
Active Revelle student 
falls 200 feet from cliffs 
By KYLE BIEBESHEIMER 
Staff Writer 

Revelle freshman Gilbert F.D. unez jr. fell 
to his death from atop the cliffs above Blacks 
Beach Saturday at aboLit 5 p.m. He was 18. 

Nunez and some of his friends had gone to 
the cliffs to study just after 4 p.m. The victim 
strayed away from the group to climb on a 
rock situated on the edge of the cliff when he 
lost his balance and fell.

Lifeguards estimate that Nunez descended 
nearly 200 feet before landing on the beach 
below. 

"He was an avid climber - he was practi-
cally a monkey," recalls Revelle freshm an 
Becky Bowen, a friend of Nunez's. "He was 
climbing and slipped and fell to his death." 

Trolley Options Narrowed 
Several people walking along the shore saw 

the victim plummet .down the cliff. Shortly 
thereafter, paramedics from La jolla's engine 
company No. 9 arrived on scene along with 
San Diego lifeguards. CPR was performed, but 
there was nothing anyone could do to save the 
fallen student.

for proposed trolley station on UCSD campus

Associate News Editor 

The Metropolitan Transit Development 
Board and the A.S. Council have narrowed 
down the 12 original on-campus trolley sta-
tion location proposals to four, in preparation 
for the Feb. 22 deadline, when only two pro-
posals will remain. 

Currently, the four proposed sites for the 
extension of the San Diego Trolley are under-
neath Price Center, in Pepper Canyon, and 
there are two proposals for stations in East 
Campus. Though each site has its own 
advantages, Khaleghi has expressed major 
interest in the building of the Price Center 
station. 

"I hope the city and the administration get 
together to recognize that we all need an 
alternative form of transportation that is as 

"He was a friend to all of us:said jennifer 
Pae, a friend of Nunez's. "He loved to make 
people laugh, he was so much fun to be 
around. He was the only person who knew 
everyone in the building. He was such a 
friendly, loving person and that's what makes 
it so difficult, because he was so close to 
everyone." 

When students heard of the accident, they 
immediately came together and took action. 

"The way parking is going to be, we need a 
way to get [drivers) out of their cars: said A.S. 
President Doc Khaleghi. "We need something 
that will serve the entire campus community." SeeTIMMUU!Y, Page 2 See FALL, Page 9 

uc to Pay $22.5 Million in Billing Fraud Settlement 
Regents' deputy counsel claims there was no fraud, previous cases will be dismissed 
Contributing News Writer 

The University of California 
agreed this week to pay $22.5 mil-
lion in response to an audit by the 
U.S. Department of Health and 
Human Services Office of the 
Inspector General. The settlement 
effectively closed suits of two 
alleged False Claims Act violations 
brought against the university in 
1996 and 1999 in Federal District 
Courts in San Francisco and 
Sacramento. 

The suits alleged fraudulent 
billing procedures, claiming that 
the five UC medical school hospi-
tals used incorrect coding proce-
dures. Government-funded pro-
grams such as Medicare and Medi-

ly for procedures done by residents 
instead of teaching physicians. 

john Lundberg, general deputy 
counsel for the UC Board of 
Regents. said there was no fraud. 

"There were certainly no dam-
ages, fines or penalties: Lundberg 
said. 

The False Claims Act enables 
plaintiffs in a lawsuit to receive at 
least 15 percent of the recovered 
amount if the case is settled. In this 
situation, there was no payment 
from the university to the individu-
als who tiled the suit. 

In fact, Lundberg said that the 
1996 San Francisco case will be 
dismissed entirely, being "devoid of 

facts.~

of falsely charging California's gov-
ernment-funded health care 
provider, Medi-Cal. It is unknown 
whether the plaintiffs are receiving 
any of the compensation the gov-
ernment derived from the settle-
ment. 

The Office of General Counsel 
stated that the University of 
California "came out rather well" 
in this settlement, due to its "high 
degree of compliance to begin

procedures. Lundberg said the 
institutions were down-coding as 
much as they '.vere up-coding, that 
the occurrence of both were mini-
mal, and that the hospital practices 
were close to accurate. 

The Physicians at Teaching 
Hospitals initiative was started by 
the Office of the Inspector General 
to evaluate the billing practices of 
over 40 hospitals across the nation. 

[n 1995, as a result of the same 
audit, the University of 
Pennsylvania paid $30 million to 
the federal government for the vio-
lations of one hospital. 

Public universities have also 
been hit. The University of Texas, 
San Antonio paid a $17 million set-

Trolley: 
UCSD will rwt receive 
trolley stop until 2008 
ContInued from INC. 1 
close to the center of campus as pos-
sible." he said. 

Most students believe that this 
location is the best of the proposed 
sites, as it would not require a shuttle 
to get to the center of campus. unlike 
the other sites. 

" It would be so nice just being able 
to hop on a trolley and having it actu-
ally taking me to where I want to go; 
said Revelle j unior Scott Simmonds. 
"Waiting in line for shuttles and buses 
would defeat the whole purpose for 
me. because I could easi ly park my car 
in East Parking and take the shuttle 
there." 

Moreover, many say that this site 
would save them money by not' forc-
ing them to buy a parking permit. 

" \ think some people would take it 
depending on how efficient it was; 
said Muir freshman Allison Long. " It 
would be convenient and cheap." 

Currently. the San Diego Trolley 
costs between $1 and $2.25 per ride. 
although monthly passes are available. 

The proposed Prter Cen ter site 
would be located underground. with 
an entrance in close vicinity to the 
food court. . 

By contrast. the other sites would 
require students to take a s~uttIe, 
which would take more time. This 
extra time may be a strong enough 
deterrent that students may not use 
the trolley and may instead choose to 
continue driving. 

"Having to take a shuttle from the 
parking lot to the center of campus 
would actually take more time than it 
would just driving into East Parking 
and waiting: Si mmonds said . " I 
would be willing to wait for the trolley 
if it took me where I needed to go. but 
not for [Pepper Canyon or East 
Campus\ ." 

Mark Thompson. the senior trans-
portation planner for MTDB, said 
there is still some time before the final 
location will be decided. and that no 
such date can be estimated at this 
time. 

However. Khaleghi said the elimi-
nation process will cont inue th is 
week. as he is meeting with the 
Campus Community Planning 
Commission today to discuss the four 
suggested si tes. 

Once the list has been refined to 
three. Chancellor Robert Dynes. in 
collaboration with the MTDB, will 
narrow down the locations by Feb. 22 
to two possible si tes. taking into con-
sideration cost. location and conve-
nience to students. among other fac-
tors. 

The Trolley Board will make the 
ultimate decision once the university 
and the administration have approved 
the site. 

Even though the location of the 
trolley station will be decided within 
the next six months. the UCSD site 
would not open until October of 
2008, according to Thompson. 

Students are unhappy over this late 
date. because putting a trolley on 
campus was originally proposed 20 
years ago. although nothing has hap-
pened until recently. 

"This is typical government 
bureaucracy; said Muir sophomore 
Steve Reis. "It takes years for anything 
to get done: 

The structure will not be complet-
ed until this late date. as the Federal 
Transit Administration and Congress 
will only fund one large trolley project 
within a certain radius at a time. A 
trolley station is currently being built 
for San Diego State University near 
Mission Valley, and it will be complet-
ed in 2004. 

Once this $11 7 million project is 
done. construction will begin with the 
Balboa extension that will include a 
stop at UCSD on the Orange and Blue 
lines. 

The Blue line is a 25.2-mile line 
that makes 23 stops between Mission 
Valley and the International Bor~er. 
while the 21.6-mile Orange lille 
makes 15 stops between Bayside in 
Centre City and Santee Town Center 
Station .

The Melding of 

• 

,....10n Politic eli 
President Bush 5 plan to federally fund religious 
groups would help our poor communities 

Senior Staff Writer 

Throughout his campaign, Pres-
ident George W. Bush sought to 
portray himself as a different type of 
Republican. His policy proposals 
and campaign speeches were all 
centered around the idea that he is 
a compassionate conservative. 

Congressional Republicans had 
been hurt in the past by Democra-
tic portrayals that painted all 
Republicans as greedy politicians 
who were out to get single welfare 
mothers and take their welfare 
checks away. In 
seeking to 
immunize him-
self from any 
such negative 
attacks, Bush 
made one aspect 
of his compas-
sionate conserv-
ative campaign 
centerpiece a 
proposal to allow faith-based char-
itable organizations to compete for 
federal money. 

[n the president'S own words, 
what his plan would do is "set out 
to promote the work of communi-
ty and faith-based charities. We 
want to encourage the inspired, to 
help the helper. Government can-
not be replaced by charities, but it 
can welcome them as partners 
instead of resenting.them as rivals." 

It is evident that faith -based 
organizations have been doing 
compassionate work to the helpless 
for centuries, and have been quite 

effective in doing so. 
What the Bush plan seeks to do 

is simply to extend a helping hand 
to those who are already in the 
trenches battling homelessness, 
alcohol and drug dependency, and 
various other social ills. Bush went 
on to say at the National Prayer 
Breakfast that "Millions of Ameri-
cans serve their neighbor because 
they love their God. Their lives are 
characterized by kindness, and 
patience and service to others. They 
do for others what no government 
program can really ever do: They 
provide love for another human 

being. They pro-
vide hope even 
when hope 
comes hard." 

Countless 
lives are 
changed by 
the s e 
faith-
based 
orga-

nizations on a daily 
basis, and those lives 
are testimony to their 
efficiency. It would 
be completely illogi-
cal if government 
did not do all it 
could to help 
these charities.

The presidency of George: W. 
Bush has officially begun. The next 
four years are going to be ones 
filled with shock and disbelief at 
each day's headlines reporting the 
actions of the executive branch. 
Just recently he closed the race 
relations and AIDS offices in the 
White House, then turned around 
and reopened them after a couple 
of days. 

According to TM w.u SItWt 
}oumaJ, the most shocking thing he 

money to these groups will be con-
trolled by Congress. 

One might inquire which par-
ticular faiths Dubya is interested in 
funding with this executive action. 
According to the meeting he held 
with 35 religious leaders from the 
four major religions of the United 
States - Christianity, Catholicism, 
Judaism and Islam, he will disperse 
the money to all of them. 

But wait. Let's allow logic to 
intervene into our thought process 
here. With whom does Dubya have 
the strongat ties in the religious 
community? Evangelical Protes-

You know it must be Islam. I've

BERTRAND FAN 
t occurred to me the other 
day, while I was sitting on my 
couch looking at a black 

screen because my stolen digital 
satellite had gone down, how 
dependent my life has become on 
what some may call unethical 
means. My friends and [ were dis-
cussing what drugs we should do 
for the Weezer concert. 

- "Well, we really shouldn't do 
acid because it's on a Sunday and . 
then we have finals that week, and 
the last time we did acid we didn't 
sleep for like 40 hours." 

"But at the same time, [ don't 
want to just smoke out either, 
beca use this is pretty special. [ 
mean, its Weezer, man, they 
haven't released an album in like 
five "years. [ think we should do 
shrooms. Shrooms are pretty 
damn cool and we'll only be 
screwed up for like six hours 
instead of 40." 

uYeah, I suppose those have 
some residual effects, too, but 
shrooms would be cool and we 
should do them just because we 
had a bitch of a time getting these 
tickets in the first place ... ." 

Suddenly my roommate came 
downstairs and said, "Hey, they 
zapped the card." 

"So unzap it, jerk-off." 
"No, they like really zapped the 

card." 

Turns out DirectTV had just 
about had enough of us watching 
every Pay-Per-View movie, five 
porn channels, and every local 
channel in the United States for 
the low, low price of free every 
month and they hadn't just done a 
normal zap, they had completely 
screwed over our card. 

They had sort of screwed over 
our card in the past, and then we 
would have to fix it, but this time 
they screwed it over in an unflX-
able way. So we turned on the 

By the time we reached 
UCSD, I already had 
one guy buying me a 
ticket. I parked in a "B" 
space with my grad 
student permit and 
went to the Bursar's 
office and got a sticker 
for my other 1. D. (/ 
have two UCSD l.D.s 
for this exact purpose). 
Dreamcast and played some pirat-
ed games for a while and thought 
about how we weren't going to 
watch Pay-Per-View for months. [t 
was kind of a sobering thought; 
the kind that could only be reme-
died by drugs, or alcohol, or bash-
ing our heads against the wall to 
get some sort of getting-away-
from-reality effect. 

But back to how we got the 
Weezer tickets: My friend Dan 

forwarded me an e-mail saying 
that Weezer tickets were going on 
sale the next day so we talked 
about how we would wake up 
early, say 9 a.m. , head over to the 
box office and buy the tickets. 
The next day, [ rolled out of bed 
around 11 :30, picked up Dan , 
and headed toward UCSD. On 
the way, [ called up EDNA, and 
then the box office, and they told 
me that they only had 500 tickets 
and they were only giving out one 
per I.D. [ swore, rolled a few stop 
signs, and speed-dialed a bunch 
of my friends that didn't like 
Weezer and asked them to buy 
me tickets. 

By the time we reached UCSD,

my grad student permit and went

Round Table and collected a 
bunch of I.D.s from a bunch of 
non-Weezer appreciating friends, 
and headed to the box office. They 
marked our I.D.s with a Sharpie 
and sold us some tickets. Appar-
ently they sold out in less than 
two hours. 

Soon Monday came around 
and another friend tipped me off 
that they were selling tickets 
again, so we took out our I.D.s 
and a very sharp knife and pro-
ceeded to doctor them until the 
Sharpie marks were no more, and 
bought some more tickets. All in 
all, we ended up with 11 tickets at

OPINION 5 

Students Need a 
Real Dining Facility 
By PARNAZ TAHERI 
Staff Writer 

Of the many problems here at 
UCSD, one would not think a 
place to ea t would necessarily 
top the list. But should it? In the 
case of Marshall students, food 
has turned out to be a slight 
problem that has many up in 
arms. As if eating at the small La 
Casa Restaurant were not bad 
enough, students from Marshall 
college are forced to go to differ-
ent dining facilities on weekends 
due to the fact that La Casa is 
closed on Friday nights, Satur-
days and Sundays. 

Speaking from experience, it is 
plainly obvious that most stressed 
and busy college students barely 
have the time to eat, let alone 
walk a good distance to put 
something edible into their 
empty, stricken stomachs. 

Unfortunately for students at 
Marshall, getting a quick bite to 
eat is not an option on the week-
ends. Ever since the start of fall 
2000, La Casa has been taking 
the place of Oceanview Terrace, 
which is being remodeled and 
will not be open until next year. 
The problem here lies in the fact 
that Marshall students are forced 
to go to Warren, Revelle, Muir or 
other far dining facilities to eat a 
decent meal on weekends. 

According to La Casa employ-
ees, the reason La Casa is closed 
on the weekends is that it is not a 
real dining facility, but rather a 
temporary replacement for 
Oceanview, which will be open 
next year. It is for this reason that 
the restaurant is not open on the 
weekends, and also why it closes 

at 3 p.m. on Fridays. 
Complaints and whining 

aside, it is evident that it will not 
necessarily kill the students to 
walk a few extra yards to the more 
distant eating facilities. But let us 
look at the facts. First, shultlcs are 
not in operation on the weekends 
and therefore the majority of the 
students have to walk certain dis-
tances to eat wherever they want. 

Second, with the busy acade-
mic and social lives that students 
have, walking as much as 15 min-
utes each way to ea t is yet anoth-
er burden they do not want to 
deal with. 

Third, it is practically written 
in the history books that college 
students are just plain lazy. The 
majority of the students would 
rather starve and eat stale crack-
ers than actually walk to the near-
est dining facility. 

It should also be taken to con-
sideration that for most students 
here at UCSD, especially fresh-
men, a dining facility is not on ly 
somewhere to eat, but is also an 
opportunity to meet other stu-
dents from their college. Without 
this opportunity available for 
Marshall students, they are not 
only deprived of instant food, but 
also of the chance to meet other 
Marshall students. 

With Ocean view being remod-
eled for an entire year, the least the 
administrators could have done 
was provide a dining facility for 
Marshall that is open until the 
usual 7:30 p.m. closing time every 
weekday, as well as be open every 
weekend. Having failed to give us 
even that much, a restaurant was

6 OPINION 

Pro: 
Bush 5 proposal would not 
single out a religion 
continued from ..... 4 
that the Bush admi nistra tion has 
proposed - from the nomina-
tions of Attorney General John 
Ashcroft and Interior Secretary 
Gale orton, to school vouchers 
and tax reform - are critical of 
the Bush proposal, saying that it 
would blur the lines between 
church and state. Opponents 
claim that federal money being 
funneled into such religious orga-
niza tions is a simple violation of 
the First Amendment prohibition 
of an established religion . 

However, when one looks at 
the proposal. it can be seen that 
there are three prongs that should 
pass almost anybody's constitu-
tionality test, save perhaps the 
members of such organizations as 
the American Civil Liberties 
Union . 

The Bush faith-based proposal 
allows for more tax deductions for 
the American taxpayer. It allows for 
those 80 million taxpayers who do 
not itemize their deductions to 
deduct charitable donations from 
their taxes. 

The plan would then go on to 
allow for charitable donations from 
individual retirement accounts 
without penalty, and it would also 
raise the chari table donation limit 
from 10 to 15 percent of compa-
nies' taxable income. The first part 
of the president's proposal is sim-
ply a plan to give American taxpay-
ers more incentive to give to chari-
ties. There is no constitutional con-
troversy with this aspect of the 
plan. 

The second part of the Bush 
plan creates a new office in the 
White House and asks five cabinet 
departments to look for ways to 
encourage cooperations between 

the government and religious 
groups. In addition to the new 
office, the new administration's 
plan is going to create a fund from 
federal and private funds that will 
help small community and faith -
based groups apply for grants. 
Assistance to these groups in help-
ing them apply for grants should 
also be innocuous enough not to 
stir any problems. 

The third and fi nal prong of the 
Bush proposal seems to be causing 
the most ruckus. The plan expands 
"charitable choice; allowing reli-
gious groups to receive funding for 
a variety of social programs such as 
inmate rehabilitation and the set-
ting up of afte r-school programs 
for low-income children. 

Before those on the left start 
screaming about a violation of the 
separation of church and state, they 
should see who supports Bush on 
his initiative. When Bush initially 
made the proposal, the man who 
introduced him was none other 
than Democratic nominee for vice 
president, Sen. Joe Lieberman. The 
Senator from Connecticut has 
been an avid supporter of such 
programs for quite some time. In 
addition to Lieberman, form er Vice 
President AI Gore came out in 
favor of charitable choice so that 
our nation can "meet the crushing 
social challenges that are otherwise 
impossible to meet." 

Liberal groups will have 
greater problems trying to explain 
why the Bush 's idea is a bad one. 
The key word from the Bush pro-
posal is to "expand" charitable 
choice. Religious charities that are 
highly effective in changing peo-
ple's lives, such as the Salvation 
Army and Catholic Charities, 
already do receive federal grants 
and those grants make a large 
portion of these organizations' 
annual budgets. What the Bush 
plan does is expand the amount of"

for claim to this pool of money, 
because they will have the largest 
number of organizations compet-
ing for it. 

Hypothetically though, this is 
beyond the point. Even if the 
funds are divided up rather evenly, 
the evangelical Protestant groups 
are still getting money and conse-
quently achieving their initial 
objective. Creating this office of 
faith-based community seems very 
much like Dubya paying dues to 
his most loyal voter constituency. 
How the money is divided does 
not belittle the fact that evangelical 
Protestant groups still have access 
to a $10 billion pool of money. 

Having religiously affiliated 
social organizations fight for funds 
in our capitalistic republican gov-
ernment is not a good idea . 
Although religious tensions have 
eased over the years, when money 
enters the picture it seems that 
religious prejudices would be 
heated up again. Our country is 
still victim to rampant anti-Semi-
tism, as seen from the recent arson 
and bombing attacks made on 
synagogues over the last couple of 
years. The current Israeli-Palestin-
ian conflict hasn't cooled things 

. between the Jews and Muslims 
either, as can be seen by the verbal 
and ideological fights occurring 
almost daily on Library Walk. 

As quoted from The Wall Street 
Journal, Texas Democrat Chet 
Edwards put it best when he said, 
"What kind of religious tension 
will we have among religious enti-
ties if we have tens of billions of 
dollars on the table to be divided 
among them?" The opening of 
this office and the dispersal of 
funds will simply reinforce the

sion among the other religious

We are taught growing up that 
the separation of church and state 
is a long-standing foundation of 
the United States. Well, this is. not 
totally true. Separation between 
the two is not mentioned in the 
Constitution, and it has not been 
followed consistently by Congress 
or the courts. I think the idea that 
separation of church and state has 
existed for eons is strictly a West-
ern U.S. concept. 

According to "The Logic of

American Politics; written by 
UCSD professors Gary Jacobson 
and Sam Kemell, a 1960 survey of 
school districts revealed that 77 
percent of schools in the South and 
68 percent in the East were con-
ducting Bible readings. Even 
though in 1963 the Supreme Court 
banned Bible readings in public 
schools, years later only a few Ten-
nessee schools had begun abiding. 

In 1997. despite the fact that 
public school Bible readings had 
been banned for 30 years, a feder-
al district judge found them to still

life in Alabama. The judge conse-
quently issued orders for moni-
tors to be sent.. to Alabama class-
rooms to control the situation. 

The congressional impeach-
ment hearings for Clinton were 
opened with prayers. It was only a 
couple of years ago when Newt 
and the good old boys in the 
House were trying to legalize Bible 
reading in public schools again. 

Besides infringing on our First 
Amendment rights, this creation 
of faith-based -offices has allowed 
us to hear more examples of 
Dubya's eloquent speaking skills. 
[n the press conference announc-
ing the creation of the office, 
Dubya showered the media with 
well-thought-out sentences while 
surrounded by every minority reli-
gious leader the 'good old boys 
could find . 

Negating himself within the 
same sentence he said, "We will 
not fund the religious activities of 
any group. but wh.en people of 
faith provide social services, we 
will not discriminate against 
them: Demonstrating perfect 
grammatical structure at the same 
conference he said, "Problems like 
addiction and abandonment and 
gang violence, domestic violence, 
mental illness and homeless ness 
- we are called by conscience to 
respond: Most people would 
have ended that sentence with a 
preposition, but Bush's knowl-
edge allows him to avoid con-
forming to standard English. 
[ronically, most coke addicts 
could have caused less confusion 
in constructing that selltence. 

For those of you who voted for 
Bush, don't say you didn't see this 
coming. Then again, if you voted 
for Bush, you probably do want 
mandatory Bible reading in public 
schools and for the government to 
fund the Protestant Church. So I 
guess I should be saying, "Con-
gratulations, are you happy now?" 
But I'm sure you are.

that if you're going to do something wrong,

clause of the First Amendment is completely 
dashed away. 

The Bush plan is a step in the right 
direction . It allows for the federal govern-
ment to assist those charities that have one 
success story after another. The proposal 
simply enlarges the amount of federal con-
tributions to , these groups, giving them 
more resources in their fight against the 
social ills of our country and restoring the 
lives of hurt people. All of this is done in a 
manner that is consistent with the federally 
protected rights that we as Americans hold 
dear.

your help. The following individuals are just a few of the many who have volunteered 
their time and expertise to enrich our first trimester: Professor Maria Dolinsky, 
Linguistics Department; Drs. Rozeanne and Mike Bailey, Super Computer Center; 
Dr. Gerald Balzano, Music and TEP Departments; Mr. Ken Anderson, Director of 
the UCSD Choir. 

We'd also like to thank the following organizations: La Jolla Playhouse; RIMAC; 
'Natatorium; Rock Climbing Center; Birch Aquarium; Cross-Cultural Center; and, 
the SOLO office. 

In addition, we would like to thank the UCSD Alumni Association and students for 
raising money for our outdoor study tables. Lastly, a special thank you to the more 
than 100 tutors who take time out of their busy schedules to help us each day. 
We owe our success to all of you and know you will continue to help and support 
all of us here at Preuss. Thank you again and we will keep you updated on what

WASHINGTON - The health 
care industry is lobbying the Bush 
administration to delay, change or 
kill regulations protecting the pri-
vacy of medical records. 

Hospitals, insurance companies, 
health maintenance organizations 
and medical researchers say the 
rules, issued in the final weeks of 
the Clinton administration, would 
impose costly new burdens. But 
members of Congress say privacy

requests to shelve the rules or 
reopen the rule-making process to 
solici t public comment on the need 
for major changes. 

John P. Houston, a lawyer at 
UPMC Health System, affiliated 
with the University of Pittsburgh, 
said hospitals would have to buy 
expensive information technology,

uled to take effect

with the rules. The 
rules, he said, are so

Under the rules, health care 
providers must obtain written con-
scnt from patients for the use or 
disclosure of information in their 
medical records. The rules will 
affect virtua lly every doctor, 
patient, hospital, pharmacy and 
insurance plan in the United 
States. 

Critics say the Clinton adminis-
tration went overboard in pursuing 
a worthy goal. The rules, they say, 
are too prescriptive and, in many 
ways, unworkable. Health care 
providers of all types have flooded 

public cares about 
this issue very, very much," he said. 

Under the rules, every health 
care provider must appoint a "pri-
vacy official" to develop privacy 
policics and procedures. Patients 
would, for the first time, have a fed-
eral right to inspect and copy their 
medical records and could propose 
corrections. A health care provider 
would have to keep track of every-
one who received medical informa-
tion from the files, and a patient 
could demand that doctors and 
hospitals provide an accounting of 
all disclosures in the last six years.

Rolling Blackouts Hit 
Russia as Services Fail 

RAZDOL OYE, Russia 
Nikolai A. Yudin may be the most 
unpopular man in this desolate 
town of 13,000 in the Primorsky 
Region, about an hour's drive from 
Russia's southeast Paci fi c coast. He 
is responsible for supplying the radi-
ators of 2,000 residents with hot 
water pumped from the factory's 
boiler. This winter, he has done nei-
ther. Primorsky's sputtering power 
plants have too little coal to generate 
more than a trickle of electricity, and 
Yudin 's factory gets less than a third 
of what it needs to stay open. 

The regionwide fuel shortage 
here has disrupted the lives of hun-
dreds of thousands of people, 
brought unspeakable misery fo r 
tens of thousands, and killed 
scores. In the worst winter in a half-
century, with temperatures down to 
50 below zero, Primorsky's four 
electrical generating stations have 
resorted to rolling blackouts, 
plunging even big cities like 
Vladivostok into darkness and chill 
for as long as 12 hours a day. 

At least 28 people have died 
from exposure or from fires and 
asphyxiation caused by faulty heat-
ing devices. Children have gotten 
frostbite; schools have closed; 
whole villages have lost heat, power 
or both for weeks. The boiler at 
Yudin's factory burned its last good 
heating coal on Dec. 28. 

Primorsky's real crisis is a col-
lapse of basic services in what 
many call the most mismanaged, 
neglected and corrupt of Russia's 

89 regions. For that, many blame 
the administration of the gover-
nor, Yevgeny I. Nazdratenko. 

Since 1993, Nazdratenko, 51, 
has ruled Primorsky almost as if it 
were independent of Moscow -
which, being almost 6,000 miles 
and eight hours away by jet, it near-
ly has been. 

On Feb. 5, President Vladimir 
Putin reacted sharply, firing 
Russia's energy minister and secur-
ing Nazdratenko's resignation. But 
the shortages remain. 

Of course, though all of this, 
some people keep warm without 
difficulty. 

In Vladivostok, in the neighbor-
hood called Sanatornaya, with a 
breathtaking view of the Pacific 
Ocean, builders are erecting 10 
magnificent three-story homes. 
Their owners are not a matter of 
public record, and city officials are 
sti ll trying to evict a clinic for dis-
abled children to clear more space 
for the houses. 

Press reports say that some of 
the houses will go to the mayor, the 
provincial prosecutor, the regional 
police chief and the provincial 
financial chief. The second-biggest 
home, at 8,500 square feet, has 

marble~taircases, a hot tub, a glass-
enclosed winter garden and a wine 
cellar. Cold weather is unlikely to 
be a problem. The home has a pri-
vate heating system, too.

Investigators Unsure Why Submarine 
Failed to Detect Japanese Trawler 

WASHINGTON - In parallel 
efforts to untangle Friday's naval 
mishap off the coast of Hawaii, 
Navy and civilian investigators 
spent Sunday debriefing crew 
members and reviewing logs from 
the Navy submarine whose 
abrupt surfacing as pa.rt of drill 
caused the sinking of a Japanese 
fishing vessel. 

A search by Coast Guara and 
Navy vessels was continuing for 
the nine Japanese, including four 
high school students, who were 
not among the 26 crew members 
and teen-age students plucked 
from the sea after the incident. 
But as nightfall approached in 
Hawaii, hopes for further rescues 
were dwindling. 

A central question in the two 
probes, Navy and civilian officials 
said, would be how the crew of 
the 360-foot submarine, the USS 
Greeneville, could have failed to 
detect the presence overhead of 
the 190-foot Japanese vessel, the 
Ehime Maru, before surging to 
the surface. 

After the Greeneville returned 
to its home port of Pearl Harbor

That is not a large percentage 
of the thousands of companies

with. In these shaky days of the 
Internet economy, though, it is 
remarkable that a company would 
turn away business. 

But DoubleClick, which distrib-
utes ads to consumers on thou-
sands of Web sites, has taken a pub-
lic beating from advocates for pri-
vacy rights, who contend that it 
tracks people's online wanderings 
too intrusively. 

The company has consistently 
denied that its policies violate C9n-
sumer privacy; the Federal fude 
Commission recently dropped an 
inquiry, but it still faces class-

At the same time, businessmen

creation of a promised Assets 
Management Corp. that would 
spend public money to soak up 
$12 billion in bad bank loans and 
put them back in the black. 

Thaksin, 51, who has the 
biggest popular mandate any 
modern Thai leader has attained, 
has come face to face with the 
promises he made to win it. His 
near-majority victory has pro-
duced high hopes for a stable gov-
ernment, accompanied by a 
healthy bounce in the stock mar-
ket and in investor confidence. 

But critics warn that his 
promises could drain the national

waves had not been big 
enough to toss seawater 
into boats. 
on Saturday, the submarine's 
skipper, Lt. Cmdr. Scott Waddle, 
was relieved of his post pending 
the results of the investigations. 

Some members of the Japanese 
crew and their relatives have also 
asked why the American sub-
mariners did not join directly in 
rescue efforts, particularly in the 
initial half-hour after the sinking, 
before Coast Guard ships and air-
craft arrived on the scene. 

Adm. Thomas Fargo, com-
mander in chief of the Pacific 
Fleet, said at a Navy briefing in 
Honolulu that choppy seas, with 
waves of 3 feet to 4 feet and a 6-
foot swell, had made it too dan-
gerous for the Greeneville crew to 

state attorneys general. And so 
Doub1cClick is redoubling its 
efforts to build a reputation as a 
company that protects privacy. 

While DoubleClick's renewed 
emphasis on privacy may be the 
most noteworthy example, the 
company is far from alone in its 
mission. 

Chief privacy officers like 
Polonetsky are increasingly com-
mon in the executive suite - and 
not just at dot-corns. CPOs, as they 
are called, have been appointed at 
companies like IBM, AT&T and 
Eastman Kodak. There are now at 
least 100 privacy chiefs in the 
United States, making $125,000 to 
$175,000 a year, said Alan F. 
Westin, who runs a training pro-
gram for chief privacy oif:cers asso-
ciated with his organization, 
Privacy and American Business. 

But while it may be unrealistic 
to believe that the rise of the chief 
privacy officer will automatically 
lead to better privacy, many advo-
cates for privacy rights say that the 
shift is real. 

"It's a significant development; 

treasury and that the euphoria of 
the moment could evaporate 
quickly. Thailand, the epicenter of 
the region's economic crisis, could 
begin to slip backward after the 
painful reforms and incrementl\1 
gains of the defeated administra-
tion of former Prime Minister 
Chuan Leekpai. 

The feel-good campaign 
pledges could grind the economy 
down again, economists say. The 
promised programs could raise 
Thailand's debt from 60 percent 
of its gross national product to 
more than 100 percent, according 
to a recent report by the Standard 
Chartered Bank. 

More fundamentally, there are 
concerns that Thaksin, who grew 
rich as a telecommunications 
baron under the old system of 
patronage politics, will begin to 
undercut the democratic reforms 
that have taken tentative root 
under Chuan's three-year admin-
istration. 

Thaksin has said he would like 
to soften measures imposed by 
the International Monetary Fund 

open hatches and take survivors 
on board. . 

But the captain of the Japanese 
ship, Hisao Onishi, told reporters 
separately that the waves had not 
been big enough to toss seawater 
into lifeboats. 

The first Coast Guard heli-
copters arrived on the scene about 
30 minutes after the incident, but 
the first rescues were not made 
until about 15 minutes later, after 
the first ships arrived on the scene, 
a Coast Guard spokesman said. 

A senior Navy official, who 
spoke on the condition of 
anonymity, said he found it hard 
to explain how the incident could 
have occurred if normal surfacing 
procedures were followed. But he 
said that the most likely explana-
tion could have been that officers 
responsible for conducting a 
periscope search somehow failed 
to see the Japanese vessel, either 
because of choppy seas or 
beca use some other obstacle was 
in the way.

The New York Times 

said Marc Rotenberg, head of the 
Electronic Privacy Information 
Center, a policy group in 
Washington. Rotenberg. a frequent 
critic of business and government 
when privacy blunders occur, said: 
"This has become part of main-
stream business culture." 

A privacy officer's major tasks 
include complying with the grow-
ing patchwork of local, state, fed-
eral and international laws and 
regulations that govern privacy. 

Some chief privacy officers will 
work with lawmakers to help 
design privacy legislation now that 
the topic has become a major 
issue in Congress. More than a 
dozen bills have been introduced, 
and Rep. Edward Markey, 0-
Mass., has predicted that privacy 
will become "the civil rights issue 
of the decade." 

Westin said that dealing with 
the legislative effort "will be one of 
the really big tests to see If CPOs 
are really doing their job:

while helping to increase foreign

Despite his image as a modem 
politician and his party's slogan, 
"New thinking, new implementa-

reform remains in question. He 
has formed a government coali-
tion with the parties of two past

tributed to the collApse. 

Thaksin also is fighting an 
indictment by the National 
Countercorruption Commission 
after being accused of hiding his 
assets. If' convicted by a 
Constitutional Court, he could be 
summarily barred from holding 
office and removed from his post. 

He has insisted on his inno-

his popularity remains high, the

Neuroscience Professor Passes Away 
John. S. O'Brien discovered the genetiC cause of Tay-Sachs disease 
By ALeX J. LEE 
Associate News Editor 

UCSD Professor of 
Neurosciences and founder of 
Myelos Neurosciences 
Corporation John S. O'Brien 
passed away in his La Jolla home 
Feb. 1. 

Internationally known for his 
discovery of the genetic cause of 
Tay-Sachs disease and his devel-
opment of screening tests for the 
disease, O'Brien was first 
recruited by the UCSD School 
of Medicine in 1968 after six 
years as a faculty member at the 
University of Southern 
California . 

His scientific work and his 
efforts in support of screening 
led to the establishment of wide-
spread, coordinated screening, 

education and counseling pro-
grams for high-risk individuals, 
resulting in a 'decrease in the 
number of Tay-Sachs de.aths. 

Chairman of the Department 
of Neurosciences at the UCSD 
School of Medicine, Leon ThaI, 
remembers O'Brien fondly. 

"John was a world-class sci-
entist, an esteemed colleague, a 
wonderful mentor to his stu-
dents and a warm, caring indi-
vidual who will be deeply 
missed ," ThaI said. 

UCSD Vice Chancellor for 
Health Sciences Edward W. 
Holmes remarked on O'Brien's 
contributions to the field ofsci-
ence. 

"[He) was an early pioneer in 
the application of knowledge 
gained in the laboratory to help 
patients; Holmes said. "He built 

upon his important scientific 
work to become an advocate for 
genetic screening and education 
programs, effectively bridging 
the gap between basic science 
and patient care: 

O'Brien is survived by his 
wife Susan, his mother Esther, 
his sister Linda and her husband 
Peter O'Brien-Rothe and six 
children. 

At this time, only private fam-
ily services are planned. The 
family requests that all dona-
tions be sent in lieu of flowers to 
support the UCSD graduate 
program in Neurosciences. In 
addition, checks should be made 
out to the UCSD Foundation 
and sent to the following name 
and address: Leon). That MD,

SIO Engineer Receives ,Nichol Award 
By _ OFF DIETRICH 
Staff Wfiter 

Scripps Institution of 
Ocean.ography research engineer 
and senior lecturer Richard 
Seymour was recently honored 
with the 2000 John G. Moffatt and 
Frank E. Nichol Harbor and 
Coasta l Engineering Award. 

The prestigious honor is 
awarded annually by the 
American Society of Civil 
Engineers. Seymour received the 
award in recognition of his life-
long contributiqns and leadership 
in the field of coastal engineering. 

His status with the ASCE was 
also elevated to Fellow in com-
mendation for his life work in the 
field . 

" It is very rewarding to be rec-
ognized by your peers; Seymour 
said . 

The rich history of past recip-
ients of the award is not lost on 

him. 
"I'm very proud to get the 

award," Seymour said. "The gods 
of coastal engineering have been 
past recipients. I'm very proud to 
be included." 

Robert Guza, a professor at 
Scripps, acknowledged Seymour 
as having a "long and illustrious 
career; as well as "being a leader 
in studying the California wave 
climate." 

Throughout his career, 
Seymour's research has covered a 
wide range of topics, from the 
practical to the theoretical. On the 
practical side, he has studied 
coastal sediment transport and 
shoreline erosion. He is also 
renowned for his theoretical work 
with surface gravity waves. 

His greatest achievement may 
be the creation of the Scripps 
Coastal Data Information 
Program for furthering the study 
of surface gravity waves. What

started in 1976 with a single buoy 
off Imperial Beach has blossomed 
into one of the world's largest sci-
entific data collection networks. 

Scripps research associate Ron 
Flick credits the success of the 
CDIP to Seymour's innovative 
thinking and ability to make the 
theoretical accessible. 

Flick noted that Seymour "was 
the first to make a practical system 
to measure statistical properties of 
ocean waves." 

One of the goals of the project 
was to bring a research tool to the 
level of common practicality. 
Seymour helped make this goal a 
reality. 

Currently, he is working on an 
expansion ofCDIP to measure the 
impact of waves on the shoreline. 
The research is taking place at 
North Torrey Pines. It will include 
monitoring sand movement on 
and off the beach,which is valu-
able for testing computer models.

Some went to the cliff where the 
accident happened to lay flowers in 
memory of their friend. Others plan 
to hold a candlelight vigil this week. 

By Sunday afternoon, less than 
24 hours after the accident took 
place, family members had arrived 
at Revelle College's Atlantis Hall to 
retrieve Nunez's belongings. 

Student~ could hardly maintain 
their composure as they assisted 
Nunez's father in moving his 
belongings out of his room. Some 
openly wept as they packed boxes 
filled with personal items into a 
rented U-Haul trailer. 

Others wrapped their arms 
around those who were overtaken 
by the reality that their friend was 
gone. 

Perhaps the most emotional 
moment took place when several 
students presented the victim 's 
father with a picture frame con-
taining a poem written especially 
for his son. The poem was sur-
rounded by a dozen photographs 
taken at UCSD of Nunez with his 
suitemates and friends.

The UCSD School of Medicine 
spent $3 .5 million during the 
course of the investigation, accord-
ing to sources within the medical 
school. 

The UC system spent approxi-
mately $15 million in professional 
fees during the course of the audit. 

The motivation for this settle-
ment was economic, as running out 
the litigation would have cost mil-
lions more than the $22.5 million 
paid as a result of the settlement. 

NEWS 9 

Several friends worked through 
the night to finish the project in 
time to present it to the Nunez 
family. 

More than 20 students and sev-
eral family members then held 
hands and formed a circle in the 
parking lot to remember their 
friend one last time. 

Each bowed their heads in 
respect, and some offered a few 
words in memory of their good 
friend . 

As the family prepared to 
depart , one student brought a 
bouquet of flowers to the victim's 
father. At that moment, many stu-
dents broke down crying. 

As one person ran to get tis-
sues, the last of Nunez's belong-
ings were packed up. Family mem-
bers thanked the students one last 
time for their support before they 
left UCSD for the long journey 
home. 

"You've got to kind of remem-
ber what he did, and not just what 
happened recently," said Graham 

Lubins~y, a Revelle freshman and 
suitemate of Nunez's. "He led a full 
life. He had an impact on everyone 
he dealt with, and that's what you 
have to remember. You can't be 
upset forever about one incident 
- you've just got to keep him in 
your heart." 

According to Lundberg, the real 
savings was time. Attempting to set-
tle the matter in court would have 
been "a long, protracted litigation," 
he said. 

Following the audi t, the UC 
schools have implemented compli-
ance plans that call for specialized 
officers on each campus, a commit-
tee to deal with potential violations, 
and education programs designed 
to increase awareness of proper 
accounting procedures. This 
increase in oversight aims to bring 
the hospitals into further compli-
ance with federal regulations. 

Lundberg cited the clearer reg-
ulations put in place in 1996 as 
enabling the university to imple-
ment effective plans for financial 
accountability.

EATU 
A Guide to 

have to be honest with 
you . ['m not a psycholo-
gist. I'm not a marriage 
counselor. So why am I 
giving advice on college 
relationships? 

It's because I've had my share of 
experiences that have taught me a lot. 
[n addition to my relationships, [ have 
also seen many close friends go 

through the difficulties of college 
relationships_ 

My hope is that others can learn 
from our mistakes, as well as our 
triumphs, by reading this article_ 

That said, here are my humble 
offerings of advice about life 
and love in college. 

A WIIoIe New Wortd 
The first thing you must 

realize is that you aren't in 
Kansas anymore, Dorothy. 
College relationships are on an 
entirely different plane of exis-

tence than high scho~1 relation-
ships. While many college rela-

tionships fall short in magnitude 
when compared to post-college 
relationships, they are much more 

serious than your typical high school 
relationship. 

Gone are the weeks on end when 
all you see of your so-called signifi-
cant other is the 15 minutes 
between math and sci-
ence, Since not 
everyone has 
the same 

Some 
advice for 

those of 
you who 

have been 
unlucky in 

love 

2Jx josh Grouse, 
gealures edilor 

schedule in college, it takes some effort 
to actually see your boyfriend or girl-
friend. This means that you two mi$ht 
actually have to go on a date, a foreign 
concept to many high school students. 

The dating world can be a lot differ-
ent in college as well . Whereas trips to 
the movie theater with a large group of 
friends passed for dating in high 
school, the majority of college women 
expect dinner along with the movie. 
You can also forget about the mob of 
friends there for moral support. Most 
college dates, especially the first ones, 
are just the guy and the girl, or at least 
they should be. 

""'IIC 
An interesting feature of college 

relationships is that they can serve as a 
springboard into post-college relation-
ships. Prior to college, if two people 
went out to a movie together, they were 
most likely "together." The concept of a 
date in high school was virtually 
nonexistent, save a select few seniors at 
every high school. 

Dating can be a great thing if done 
right. On the other hand, it can also be 
the gateway to hell . Let me explain_ 

The purpose of dating is to get to 
know another person. Ideally, two peo-
ple who didn 't quite know each other 
could go out and have a good time 

talking about their lives and 
their dreams. They 

could share what 
kind of per-

son they 

are with each other. By the end of a few 
dates, the two people have, ideally, 
learned enough about each other to 
make an educated decision as to 
whether or not they wanted to pursue 
a relationship. Unfortunately, things 
don 't always work like that. 

One of the drawbacks to dating is 
that the two people are usually too 
worried about making a good impres-
sion on the other person that they 
completely forget to be themselves. As 
a result, each person is left with a vague 
idea of who the other is. Often times, 
people take this information to heart 
and enter into a relationship, not 
knowing too much about the other. 

FEATURES 11 

The inevitable conclusion is that 
the hidden quirks come to fruition 
once the person's guard is down. These 
quirks can come as a shock to the 
other person and can get on their 
nerves. This can lead to ugly fights and 
even breakups_ 

The one cure for this unsightly out-
come is to be honest from the start. If 
.the other person doesn 't like you for 
who you are, then that person probably 
isn't the right person for you in the first 
place. This sounds like pure common 
sense, but you would be surprised how 
many people do not follow this advice.

The Soapbox 
By ALEX J. LEE 
Associate News Editor 

The' opening lines of San 
Diego's latest revival of David 
Henry Hwang's play "FOB" begin 
with a man's mean-spirited lec-
ture on all that he hates about 
FOBs, referring to people who are 
"Fresh Off the Boat,W calling them 
"clumsy, stupid, greasy and 
horny." As the lights brighten, the 
identity of the speaker becomes 
apparent. The speaker is an Asian 
male. 

In truth, this self-loathing 
among Asian-American males is 
common enough for me to write a 
commentary on it. Granted , not 
all Asian-American males hate 
themselves, but I would venture to 
say that most have at one point in 
their lives. More accurate ly 
though, they probably have hated 
society's image of them, or the 
prevailing stereotypes that have 
plagued Asian-American males 
for years. 

Let's face it: minorities usually 
get shortchanged by society as far 
as how they're represented. 
Stereotypes and misconceptions 
thrive iR our collective con-
science. Asian-American males 
have been no exception. Most 
recently, they have been deemed 
effeminate. nerdy and unattrac-
tive. 

The popular flash-animation 
"comic" character of Mr. Wong 
remains as one of the saddest 
examples of how stereotypes of 

The UCSD Guardian 

Society's Stereotyping of 
Asian-American Men Can 
Lead to Self-Loathing 

Asian men prevail in our society, 
with his "slant-eyed yellow face" 
and "buckteeth" still persisting 
even in the 21 st century. 

Not all forms of racism are as 
obvious. Most are much more 
subtle, like the media's constant 
misrepresentation of Asian-
Americans. 

Growing up Asian-American 
has not been easy. Along with all 
the self-doubt and questions of 
identity that characterize any ado-
lescence, there was the added ele-

Not all forms of racism

are much more subtle, 
like the fact that the 
media never seems to 
represent Asian-
Americans accurately. 

ment of being an Asian-American 
male in a society that appeared to 
ignore us. 

It's something that most 
Asian-American males under-
stand but never talk about: a feel-
ing of invisibility. In short, we 
don't fit any of the typical defini-
tions of masculinity or maleness. 
Physically smaller and less threat-
ening than most other males, it 
was easy to feel less than a man. I, 
and any of my Asian-American 

peers no matter how good looking 
we are to ourselves, know we can 
never look like the non-Asian 
romantic leads of your typical 
Hollywood flick or weekday sit-
com. 

So where did this leave me? 
Where does it leave most Asian-
American males who never see 
themselves on television or in the 
movies as anything more than a 
fleeting extra or the nerd w~o 
knows the answer to some ridicu-
lously complex physi~ problem? 
It leaves us wondering hO\" :;00-
ety really looks at us and why no 
one seems to understand why we 
feel alienated. 

Over the past 30 years, it has 
become more socially acceptable 
for an Asian woman to marry a 
white male, but the opposite has 
not been the case. Historically, the 
role of wives to their husbands 
has been a submissive one. In 
other words, it didn't matter if a 
white man and a minority woman 
matded, because she would 
already be deemed subordinate. 
As long as he was white, he ful-
filled the role of the dominant 
male husband. 

This also seems to be the same 
logic behind most television news 
formats. It is rare to see a minori-
ty male, especially an Asian male, 
opposite a white female anchor. 
The reason is that our society has 
always sent the message that 
Asian males are not the masculine

Students Should Give in to Sweet 
Temptation This Valentine's Day 
While previously tl10ught of as an unhealthy food, studies have 
shown that chocolate can actually be good for you 
IyIllUYWONI 
Senior Staff Writer 

Chocolate is one of the most 
luxurious and craved foods in the 
world. A true chocaholic knows 
that just the mention of chocolate 
will evoke pleasurable thoughts. 

The average American con-
sumes 11 .5 pounds of chocolate 
per year, whereas the Swiss con-
sume twice this amount. 
According to lJJ:vw.onhealth.com, 40 
percent of women and 15 percent 
of men admit to regular chocolate 
cravings. 

Who says that something that 
tastes so good is bad for your 
health? In fact, studies have 
shown that chocolate can actually 
have positive effects. So grab a bar 
of chocolate, read this article and 
realize you're doing something 
good for y~lUr body. 

-Chocolate is derived from the 
cocoa tree threobroma cacao, which 
is- native to Central and South 
Amerjca.loday, these beans are 
cultivated around the equator and 
can be found in the Caribbean, 
Africa, Southeast Asia and even in 
the Pacific islands of Samoa and 
New Guinea. 

At the time, cocoa beans were 
used as the local currency and 
they were recognized as among 
the many treasures stolen from 
the Aztecs. When the Spaniards 
took the chocolate back to 
Europe, they used it as a drink. 
This drink was a luxury not many 
could afford. 

Afterward, when the Spaniards 
monopolized chocolate, the 

French, English lind Dutch began 
to cultivate chocolate as well . 
Increased production reduced the 
prices of cocoa and soo~ t.he 
masses in Europe and Ammca 
were enjoying what once was con-
sidered a delicacy. In 1828, choco-
late maker Conrad J. van Houten 
patented an inexpensive way of 
pulverizing the beans into powder, 
which later facilitated making 
chocolate drinks and solids as 
well. 

As for caffeine, it tums 
out that chocolate's 
caffeine level is about the 
same as a cup of 
decaffeinated coffee. 

Let's now dispel some myths 
about chocolate. Here's a list of 
the ingredients in chocolate: min-
erals, caffeine, saturated fat, threo-
bromine, phenylethlamine, anan-
damide, sugar and flavonol s. 
Explaining these components 
individually will further our 
understanding of chocolate. 

Minera ls such as copper and 
magnesium are present in choco-
late. Of course, people need these 
every day. The amount of caffeine 
in chocolate is insignificant com-
parable to the amount in a cup of 
decaffeinated coffee. There are 
about 10 milligrams of caffeine 
per average 1.65-ounce bar, com-
pared with about 80 milligrams in 
a cup of coffee. One would have to

be extremely sensitive to caffeine 
to fear eating a feeble chocolate 
bar. 

People often worry about satu-
rated fat because it clogs arteries, 
restricts blood flow to the heart 
and causes heart attacks. About 
one-third of dark chocolate is nat-
urally-produced cocoa butter, 
which is a form of saturated fat. 

However, medical researchers 
have found that not all saturated 
fats are the same and that cocoa 
butter does not raise cholesterol 
levels in the body. As a matter of 
fact, one report even points out 
that "exaggerated consumption" 
will actually lower cholesterol. 
That is to say, much of the cocoa 
butter consumed is not absorbed 
as it passes through our bodies. 

According to a repor.t by 
www.onhealth.com. chocolate may 
actually raise the good form of 
cholesterol, HDL, and reduce a 
bad form of fat, triglycerides, due 
to the high content of stearic acid 
in the cocoa butter. 

Now consider threobromine, 
defined as a bitter, volatile alkaloid 
resembling caffeine in its chemical 
structure, but with a mild effect on 
humans. Horses and dogs are very 
sensitive to threobromine, and 
that is why chocolate can be 
harmful to them. 

Phenylethylamine is an 
amphetamine-like psychoactive 
drug with an effect that is said to 
resemble that of ecstasy, the feel-
ing of being in love. There is 
phenylethylamine in chocolate,

A side note to the whole issue of 
"I love you" is that those words 
should not be uttered in the heat of 
passion. Many have been scared 
away by someone screaming "I love 
you" during, or in close proximity 
to, sex. The fact is that hormones 
and emotions are raging while peo-
ple do their thing, so it's not a good 
idea to say "I love you" for the first 
time during sex. I would recom-
mend not saying it for an hour after 
sex, kind of like eating and swim-
ming. That way you get a chance to 
calm your emotions and figure out 
if you really mean it. 

8ettI1IC ....,... 
Taking this step in the relation-

ship is different for everybody, so 
I'm not going to spend a lot of time 
dwelling on the subject. 

My advice on getting physical is 
to simply wait until both people 
feel completely comfortable with it. 
Rushing into it before one of the 
partners is .ready can lead to 
unnecessary tension in the rela-
tionship. 

The same goes for pressuring a 
partner to go further. If you truly 
care about the person, then you 
will wait until your partner is ready 
as well . 

A side note on purely physical 
relationships: It has been my 
experience that these never turn 
out well. When two people say 
that they are just in it for the 
physical aspect and they don 't 
want a relationship, things usually 
don 't turn out the way you would 
like. Inevitably, somebody starts to 
get feelings for the other. It's just 
not worth it , at least in my experi -

late is anandamide, which is a nat-
urally-occurring chemical in our 
brains that mimics the effects of 
eating or smoking marijuana. 
However, to fully have that effect, 
one must consume at least 20-30 
pounds of chocolate in one sitting. 
That's twice as much chocolate as 
the average American eats in a year. 

The sugar in chocolate is usual-
ly table sugar, which isn't as bad as 
the high fructose com syrup that 
sweetens almost everything else in 
our grocery stores. 

. ence. 

Pr.III ••• 
No matter how close two people 

are, there are always going to be 
problems in a relationship. I have 
yet to encounter a couple that has 
gone out for longer than a couple 
of months that hasn't had at least 
one argument 

The key to getting through 
problems in a relationship is hon-
esty. I am convinced that this is all 
that is needed. The real problems 
come when people bottle up their 
emotions and then unleash their 
fury in one epic argument, leading 
to more serious problems than if 
they had simply been honest in the 
first place. 

... so it's not a good idea 
to say "I love you" for 
the first time during sex. 
I would recommend not 
saying it for an hour 
after sex, kind of like 
eating and swimming. 
That way you get a 
chance to calm your 
emotions and figure out if 
you realry mean it. 

If you are completely honest 
with your partner, then things will 
turn out the way they should. If 
you two find that you are truly dif-
ferent people, then it is better to be 
honest about it than to drag out the 
relationship. It may hurt, but it is 
the right thing to do.

ple very defensive, which can lead 
to escalated fights and a bigger 
problem than the one that Started 
the argument. The breakup 
should be a last resort , used only 
when all other options have been 
exhausted. 

8ettI1IC ...... tile .... 
While breaking up is tough , it is 

a part of life. After all, you're going 
to break up with everyone that you 
go out with except the person that 
you marry. But even your spouse 
isn 't immune to the breakup, as 
recent figures on divorce will con-
firm . 

The important th ing is that you 
don 't give up on relationships. If 
someone breaks up with you, then 
you should move on. I'm not say-
ing you have to go out on a date the 
very next day, but you should get 
out there eventually. 

There will be an inevitable 
grieving period. The length of it 
will vary based on the length of the 
relationship, the kind of person 
you are, as well as the kind of per-
son that your ex is. A good way to 
get through it is tp surround your-
self with friends, and realize that 
life goes on .

Soapbox: 
Society has a stereotypical 
image of rfUlSculinity 
ideal. Obviously, the issue is not 
black and white or as simple as I 
present it. I exaggerate. But, ask 
almost anyone, Asian or not, and 
they'll probably know what I'm 
talking about. 

Now, before I get some people 
too riled up, allow me to clarify my 
point. I'm not trying to call upon 
some sort of revolution in how 
people choose their mates, nor am 
I saying that interracial dating 
should be the goal of every male 
and female. To marry or choose a 
mate based on specific criteria like 
race would be a terrible mistake. 
Tlfe goal ultimately should be to 
remain as open as possible and fol -
low what your heart tells you. Trite 
words, I know, but true just the 
same. 

The current trend of interracial 
marriage simply seems to be an 
interesting indication of how far 
our society has come in terms of its 
perceptions of Asian-American 
l11ales as a whole. 

All right, so it's true that Asian 
males are featured in countless 
martial arts films, and yes, they are 
portrayed as being the strong, 
Superman type. But how often do 
you see Bruce Lee getting the girl 
at the end of the movie? 

A friend of mine has an interest-
ing view on th e situation. 
According to him , feeling undesir-
able to white girls was not the only 
case, but he fclt undesirable to all 
girls of all races in general. In 
essence, he believes that "Asian ' 
guys are the crap left over," at least 
in the opinion of most girls. In a 
recent "Newsweek" article, a 
Filipino from San Francisco, 
Marlon Villa, whose wife happens 
to be white, elaborated on this 
common sentiment. 

"Black guys are studs, white 
guys have all the power and Asian 
guys are the nerdy little wimps that 
women wouldn 't glance at," Villa 
said. 

As odd as this may sound, I feel 
there is truth in these statements. 
One need not go any further than 
the local Abercrombie & Fitch to 
see society's popular ideal of mas-
culinity - a white male model , 
complete with chiseled jaw and 
raging pects, staring you straight in 
the face. Big surprise, there isn 't a 
single Asian male among them. It's 
as if society keeps reminding us 
that we, as.,Asian-American males, 
do not fit tfle masculine ideal - so 
stop trying. 

All this talk of prevailing stereo-
types that surround Asian guys 
reminds me of a particularly eye-
opening experience that happened 
to me not long ago. At this point, 
I've told it to friends so many times 
that it's already become cliche, yet 
it still never fails to leave my listen-
er speechless, not knowing whether 
to laugh hysterically or to frown in 
disgust. Suffice to say, I'll call this 
story my "date from hell." For the 
sake of embarrassment, ( prefer to 
usc fake names of people instead of 
real ones. And yes, this really hap-
pened. 

About a year ago, I frequented a 
popular eatery in San Diego. Every 
now and then, I would chat with 
the servers and waiters. Someone 
who always seemed to make an 
effort to talk with me was a server 
by the name of "Lisa." A friendly 
girl of 19, Lisa was not terribly 
bright but sweet just the same. 

She was blond and aggressive 
and towered nearly a foot taller 
than me. Lisa was a force to reck-
oned with, one that I never in my 
wildest nightmares thought I 
would have to encounter. 

As I was waiting in line one day 
to buy my food, she asked me for 
my number. I, being a little more 
naive back then, was happy to 
oblige. I thought that all that would

The UCSD Guardian 

Soapbox: 
Interracial marriages 
are on the rise 

come of this casual exchange of 
personal information was a new 
friendship. 

Little did I know, she wanted 
me, Alas, I was not attracted to her 
and did not want her. After our 
"first date," my indifference toward 
her made the quantum leap to fear 
and disgust. 

When she asked to hang out 
one Friday night, I was under the 
assumption that it would be a 
casual affair, one in which at most I 
would gain a new platonic friend. 
From the minute I got into her car, 
however, I knew better, 

Imagine my horror when I 
opened the door of her lAIr, only to 
be knocked out by the stench of 
cheap perfume and the glaring eyes 
.of her flirtatious face, The moment 
was truly a poignant one as I could 
see she was making a real effort to 
win me over with her overly made-
up face and revealing clothes that 
seemed to show off more of her 
unsightly flesh than I could ever 
possibly want to see in one sitting. 

I felt like I was kidnapped, with 
no place to go, From that moment 
on, I knew she considered this a 
{jate, To hell with the fact that I was 
underdressed in shorts, a T-shirt 
and flip flops; she was determined 
to give me a "first date" I would 
never forget. That's when she 
dropped the bomb and confessed 
her true feelings for me. 

"Man, I've seen you every time 
you've walked by to get food and I 
just think you're so hot; she said 
with the giddiness of a schoolgirl 

about her first crush. 
So far, no problem, I thought. 

No big problem at least. Sure, I 
didn't like her back, but I would 
soon clarify that. And then she 
dropped the bomb, I took offense 
immediately. 

"You see; she explained. "All 
my white girlfriends tell me all the 
time, 'Oh, don't dig those Asian 
guys, they're small, slant-eyed and 
smelly.' But not me, that's exactly 
why I like you so much. I so dig the 
fact that you're hairless and for-
eign. You see, I'm American and 
you're foreign and you can teach 
me all about your country: 

Words do little justice to how 
sick I felt. Her ignorance was truly 

Slowly but surely the 
media is redefining its 
image of Asian-
American men from that 
of geeky, unattractice 
and sexless to strong, 
romantic and masculine 
frightening and after a long and 
painful night, I was free from her 
wrath. But the damage was done, at 
least to my self-esteem. 

Is that what people really think 
when they see my Mian face? I 
wondered. It's a question that I 
think most Asian-Americans ask 
many times during their lives, 

The rise of the marriage rate of 
Asian men to white women, how-
ever, can be seen as a sign of how 
society is changing its views of 
Asian males. 

According to demographer 
Larry Hajime Shinagawa's book 
on marriage license data in 

Monday, February 12, 2001 

California, • Asian Americans: 
Intermarriage and the Social 
Construction of Love," Asian-
American men born in the United 
States are far more likely to marry 
women who are white (18,9 per-
cent), of other Asian ethnicity 
(22 ,7 percent) or another racial 
minority (6 percent) than more 
recent immigrants, Shinagawa 
expects the trend to continue and 
sees an even greater speedup in 
the near future. 

While many may see interracial 
marriage as a positive thing, as a 
clear indication that Asian males 
are finally being accepted and 
embraced by the mainstream, oth-
ers are not as enthusiastic. As my 
own experience -illustrates, Asian 
males continue to run the risk of 
becoming the focus of a new form 
of fetishism with which Asian 
women have become all too famil-
iar. 

Nevertheless, things are chang-
ing for the better. Slowly but sure-
ly, the media is redefining its image 
of Asian-American men from 
geeky, unattractive and sexless, to 
strong, romantic and masculine. A 
new wave of Asian actors like 
Chow Yun Fat, Rick Yune and Jet Li 
are helping to reshape old percep-
tions and create new ones. 

The battle is still an uphill one, 
yet I remain optimistic. I have 
come to the conclusion, just as 
many of my peers have, that being 
an Asian-American male is a very 
exciting thing. Because we do not 
fit popular definitions of mas-
culinity, we can forge ahead and 
create new ones that show Asian-
American males as what they truly 
are: unique and dynamic individ-
uals who like to shake things up a 
little, in hopes of making a differ-
ence.

No Luck For Men's Bball 
Triton woes continue on road, teams falls to 3-18 
By scon BURROUGHS 
Associate Sports Editor 

Chalk it up as learning experi-
ence. The Tritons' men's basket-
ba ll team engaged in a couple 
more rough Division II California 
Co llegiate Athletic Association 
matches over the weekend, and 
had nothing to show for it Sunday 
morning except some growth as a 
team, some upper circuit season-
ing, a boatload of aching body 
parts and two more notches in the 
loss column. 

Friday night, the Tritons went 
knuckle-to-knuckle with the 
Sonoma State Cossacks and Sat-
urday they did battle against the 
San Francisco State Gators in a 
closely contested match. 

The Sonoma State game was 
not a lively affair for the blue and 
gold hopefuls. Held up north in 
Rohneert Park, the tilt saw frosty 
Triton shooting and a consistent 
Cossack offensive attack. In front 
of a crowd of 519, the Tritons 
looked shaky from the opening

whistle as the team shot only 29 
percent in the first period. : 

The three-point shot, which 
the Tritons have depended heavily 
upon all season as a main offen-
sive weapon, misfired horren-
dously in this match, UCSD shot 
only three of 14 from behind the 
three-point arc. 

Sonoma State was led by the 
stellar play of Matt Knudsen, who 
had a game-high 20 points on 
eight of 13 shooting. Trevor Howe 
was also a main contributor for 
the Cossacks, netting 14 points 
and pulling down six rebounds, 
while center Chris Oliver chipped 
in with 10 points and nine 
rebounds. 

UCSD had Kyle Moyneur 
come off the bench to throw 
down a solid nine points on 3-6 
shooting. Anotherlhton standout 
this night was Sam Higgins, who 
also had nine points to go with his 
six rebounds. ~ 

It was not to be for the Tritons, 
however, as in response to a late 
surge by UCSD to pull within six, 

at 40-34, late in the game, the 
home team went on a 13-0 tear, 
effectively shutting the door on 
the Tritons' hopes for a win. The 
victory upped the Cossacks record 
to 7-8 in league play and 1 0-1 0 
overall. 

The San Francisco game was a 
largely different affair, The teams 
appeared evenly matched from the 
opening tipoff, and the lead see-
sawed between the squads 
throughout the game. 

At halftime, the Tritons were 
up by a score of 35-32, but SFSU 
outscored the Tritons by those 
same three points in the second 
half, which included a 16-8 Gator 
run to knot the game at 67 points 
apiece at the end of regulation. 
The Tritons could not get their act 
together in the overtime frame, 
and were outscored 8-4 to drop 
the match 71-75. 

The Gators saw exemplary play 
from senior Marcus Adcock, who 
had 19 points on the night.

Triton Volleyball 
Swept by BYU 
UCSD is no match for the 
Cougars, lOSing both nights 3-0 
By aeon IUIIROUGIII 
Associate Sports Editor 

Those Mormons sure can play 
them some volleyball, as the UCSD 
men's volleyball team will attest. 
The BYU squad went missionary on 
that ass this weekend, sweeping, the 
Tritons 3-0 on back-to-back nights 
to hand the secular sportsmen in 
blue and gold a pair of losses. 

Friday night's match was a sor-
did soiree for UCSD, as they com-
piled a whopping 11 errors and a 
pithy .140 hitting average on the 
night, These unremarkable Stats can 
be greatly attributed to a strong 
Cougar team. They hit .400 in the 
match, knocking down an impres-
sive 48 kills on 85 swings as a team. 
The opening round set the tone for 
the match, as Cougar freshman 
Jonathan Alleman had a BYU-
record 5 aces and the Tritons hit for 
a paltry -.069 average to lose the set 
30-16. 

It got better from thue, though, 
as the Tritons battled hard in the 
following two sets, staying within 
striking range until the final points. 
But those final points always 
seemed to fall the Cougars' way 
and the Tritons ended up losing 
both sets, by scores of 30-25 and 
30-27, respectively. 

Alleman was the standout in the 
night's match, as in addition to his 
acing spree, he also had a match-
high 14 kills and four blocks. 
Junior Matt Olsen also came 
through for BYU with seven kills 
on the night. 

UCSD saw impressive perfor-
mances from their two senior 
standouts. Donald Chen, last sea-
son's team MVP, was' once again a 
force on the floor, pounding out 12 
kills in the effort. Zach Hite, the 
other key senior performer, chipped 
in with 10 blue and gold kills. 

The Tritons returned to the dark, 

dank Smith Fieldhouse Saturday, 
hoping to gain vengeance for the 
prior evening's malfeasance. Once 
again, their hopes were dashed by 
BYU's potent attack and seemingly 
impenetrable defensive front. 

This match was more like a 
BYU house party than an actual 
volleyball game, as 10 of the 12 
players on the Cougar roster 
recorded at least one kill . They put 
up a .337 average while holding 
UCSD to .109, .with only 37 kills 
on 101 swings. The Tritons also 
committed 26 errors, as they just 
could not get their game on track 
and lost the match by set scores of 
30-25, 30-15 and 30-25. 

The third set was the brightest 
moment on this dismal evening, as 
UCSD forced seven BYU attack 
errors and climbed back into the 
game, trailing only 27-25. They 
failed to take home the set though 
as the Cougars knocked down 
back-to-back kills and took home 
the set and the victory. 

Alleman was once again a main 
component of the Cougar's attack, 
notching 11 kills, five digs and four 
blocks. 

Chell was the man for UCSD 
for the second consecuti'/e night, 
with a team high of 10 kills. Griffin 
Cogorno stepped up his game Sat-
urday night for the Tritons, turning 
in an effort wonh nine kills, four 
blocks and eight digs. 

While the weekend was a rough 
one indeed for the Thton faithful, 
they can take solace in the fact that 
these losses came counesy of the 
only unbeaten team in the nation. 
BYU's record now stands at a ster-
ling 4-0 in league and 7-0 overall. 
The Tritons record dropped to 0-4 
and 1-7 for the season. 

UCSD will look to improve 
their record starting tomorrow, 
when they face off at home against 
the University of Hawaii at 6 p.m. 

Baseball Creams Redlands 
By ROBERT FULTON 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD baseball team 
rocked the University of Redlands 
15-6 on the road Friday. 

Alexander Cremidan picked up 
the win for the Tritons, striking out 
seven in six innings. 

The Bulldogs' Billy Pope suf-
fered the loss, allowing nine runs in 
2 2/3 innings. 

The Thtons' big inning came in

the top of the third, when they 
scored eight runs. 

Offensively, rhe Tritons' Tyler 
Sullivan was on fire, scoring four 
runs off three hits to go with his two 
RBIs. Eric Thorpe also had a big day, 
driving in four runners on four hits. 

David Hawke contributed with 
three RBis of his own.

Softball: 
Chico State, UC Davis 
to be paying a visit 
ContInued ".. ..... 24 
teams went back and forth, refus-
ing to let the other pull away. 

Sonoma State again started off 
by scoring in the first. UCSD tied 
the game at one in the second half 
of the inning. Then the two teams 
neu.tralized each other defensively 
unttl the fifth, in which the Cos-
sacks put up two runs in the top half 
of the inning, only to give them back 
to UCSD in the bottom half. 

In the crucial last inning, UCSD 
had SSU down to two outs with 
nobody on, but everything fell 
apart. A single, error, double, single 

_ and another double later, Sonoma 
State had a four-run cushion and 
the eventual win. 

Junior pitcher Christi Martinelli 
was tagged with the loss, despite 
only allowing two earned runs. 
Hayes, Anderson and Kim Aggabao 
each had two hits in the effo-rt for 
the Tritons. 

Saturday against San Francisco 
State, Gator Lisa Delsman was 
throwing goose eggs until the bot-

_ tom of the fourth, when the Triton 
offense exploded to the tune of 
four 'runs on five hits. That would 
be more than enough for UCSD 
hurler Harlan, as she again went 
the distance giving up only four 
hits and two runs while striking out 
seven Gators. 

Offensively for the Tritons, Met-
tee was 3-3 while Harlan, Ander-
son and second baseman Christina 
Searing each had two hits. 

In the second game, San Francis-
co quickly jumped out to a 3-0 lead 
in the first, taking advantage of two 
UCSD errors. However, even the 
rain wasn 't enough to cool off the 
red-hot Triton offense, as they 
responded by scoring seven runs in 
the bottom of the first, the big blows 
coming on a double by Wilson and 
a two-run single by Anderson. 

Martinelli then coasted for 
UCSD until the fifth, when she 
gave up a home run to Gator 
Natalie Batista on the first pitch of 
the inning. After an RBI double 
brought the Gators within two at a 
score of 7-5, Harlan came in as 
relief and ended the threat. Harlan 
proceeded to shut down the Gators 
for the rest of the game to secure 
the victory. 

OffenSively, the Tritons ' were 
particularly impressive over the 
weekend, scoring a total of 20 runs 
in the four games. 

"OffenSively we did a great job," 
Gerckens said. "We hit the ball 
hard; we battled back a couple 
times. We have been working on 
our offense a lot since the fall. r 
think the team really focused on it, 
and it showed." 

Pitching also performed well for

Behind him, DeKiethi Walton and

down 16 points in the victory. 

The Tritons' effort was a team 
display, as four UCSD bailers were 
in double figures. Christenson led 
with 15 points, while Higgins had 
14. Cole Miller and Erik Ramp 
were good for 12 each. 

With the victory, SFSU's record 
rose to 2-14 in conference and 4-

Time to Name 
the Triton's 
New Mascot 

Fulton's 
Corner 

ROBERT FULTON 

I t's nice to see the most recent step that UCSD ath letics has taken to wrench our campus 
from the lack of school spirit. We 
finally have a mascot. 

All major athletics programs 
have mdscots. I can just now pic-
ture the Stanford tree. Duke Uni-
versity has that guy dressed as a 
Blue Devil. Seems appropriate. San 
Diego State has that silly guy 
dressed like an Aztec jumping up 
and down, who has brought so 
much controversy. 

Now we have our own Triton 
mascot. 

A mascot leads and inspires 
crowds to cheer for the home team. 
It is a symbol we can all ra lly 
around; something ·to get stoked 
about. It adds that much more to 
the experience of UCSD athletics 
and the UCSD college experience 
overall. 

Now all we need to do is name 
the mascot. 

Earlier this year, I calle\! out for 
suggestion to rename RIMAC. 
RIMAC is so dry. We need some-
thing that strikes fear or wonder -
or anything. The only suggestion 
so far are "Atlantis" and "The 
Macky." 

Now it is the mascot's.turn. 
He needs a name that repre-

sents the school, strikes fear into 
opponents, or just plain sounds 
good. 

Here are a few suggestions. 
My crack staff of reporters, (OK, 

mostly just myself and the loony 
Lobster guy) have done a lot of 
thinking, and this is what we've 
come up with . 

Timmy or Tommy the Triton 
sounds good. It has alliteration, 
which is often nice. But it sounds 
too elementary. "Look out, here 
comes Timmy the Triton. Run for 
your lives!" That is not going to 
work. 

King Triton would work. That 
was the name of Ariel's dad in the 
Disney classic, "The Little Mer-
maid." He was powerful and she 
was hot. But it is not that original. 

Neptune is also a possibility, 
being that Triton and Neptune are 
essentially the same. 

How about Monty Triton? Oh, 
wait, another school around here 
has something similar, and they 
have had trouble with that. 

There is always SIougey. It just 
sounds good. 

How 'bout Teddy RuxTriton . 
Many of us are children of the '80s. 

Other suggestions are ·Old 
Dirty Man: "Crazy old Man: and 
my favorite. "Old Dirty Bastard 
With a Fork." That would, of 
course, lead to "Big Baby Jesus with 
a Fork." All of you Wu Tang Clan 
fans will know what I'm talking 
about. 

And there is always the favorite, 
"Hungry Moses." It is derived from 
Moses with a Fork. 

Another winner that came in at 
the last second is "Mr. T." I pity the 
fool who disses UCSO! 

Well , there are my suggestions. 
If you have any more, please call 
my office at (858) 534-6582 or e-
mail me at sports@ucsdguardian.org.

Tritons Swing Through Three 
Wins Over the Weekend 
Softball splits 
against Sonoma, 
sweeps San Fran 
Iy ISAAC PEARLMAN 
Associate Sports Editor 

Going into last weekend, the 
UCSO softball team "ad yet to 
be tested in California Collegiate 
Athletic Association action, with 
their only previous two games 
against Biola, a nonconference 
opponent. But with four sched-
uled games in two days, the Tri-
tons figured they would quickly 
have a good idea of where they 
stood after the weekend was over. 

After splitting games against 
Sonoma State University Friday 
and then sweeping San Francisco 
State at home Saturday, the blue 
and gold passed their test with 
flying colors and gained a stran-
gleh.old on second place in the 
CCAA with a 3-1 conference 
record. UCSD, with an overall 
record of 5-1, is behind only Cal-
ifornia State University San 
Bernardino, which occupies the 
first-place slot with a 2-0 league 
record. 

·We're three and one: said 
head coach Patti Gerckens. 
"That's a great start. I think the 
team now knows what the CCAA 
teams are about and that they 
aren't going to die out there." 

_ In its first game against Sono-
ma State, UCSO started off on 
the wrong foot, giving the Cos-
sacks the lead with an unearned 
run in the first inning. However, 
that would be the last run SSU 
would get until the sixth inning.

pick up the victory. 

The nitons evened up the 
score in the second. when senior 
right fielder Michelle Wilson sin- _ 
gled and later scored on fresh-
man shortstop Amy Mettee's 
triple. In the fourth inning it was 
Wilson again triggering the ni-
ton offense with another single. 
After advancing to third, she 
then scored on pinch hitter Erin 
Sinclair's single to right. 

Pinch runner Angie Carr 
replaced Sinclair Ind later scored 

on a single by junior center field-;

struck again in the sixth, taking 
advantage of two SSU errors, a 
single by senior Jeanine Cordero 
and a double by junior Kristina 
Anderson to push three more 
runs across the plate and extend 
their leld to 6-2 and seal the vic-
tory.

The UCSD men's tennis team 
put the maximum hurt on Califor-
nia State University Los Angeles 
Friday. 

The nitons won with a domi-
nating 9-0 score. 

The only matchup that had any 
suspense in it whatsoever was 
between the two schools' No.1 play-
ers. UCSD's Mike Meyer outlasted 
Eddie Sengendo 7-6, 4-6, 6-4. 

The other contests were cake 
walks for UCSD 

At the [\(0. 2 spot, Jeff Wilson 
downed Jeff Miller 6-4, 6-4. No. 3 
Dan Albrecht beat Thomas Abel 6-
2, 6-3; Everett Schroeter swamped 
Cezhan Ambrose 6-1 , 6-0; No. 5 
Sean Higginbotham smoked Tai 
Thlang 6-1, 6-0; and No. 6 Ryan 
Thompson swept Richardson 
Morataya 6-0, 6-0. 

The doubles action was a 
laugher for UCSO as the nitons 
barely broke a sweat 

UCSO's team of No. 1 Meyer 
and Wilson defeated Los Angeles' 
Sengendo and Miller 8-1. 

The Thtons' No. 2 duo of 
Albrecht and Schroeter swept Los 
Angeles' Abel and Ambrose 8-0, 
and UCSD's No. 3 pair ofThomp-
son and Blake Wilson-Hayden 
spanked Los Angeles' Thlang and 
Morataya 8-1 .

out ' 

Next up for UCSO is another 
road match, this time shaping up
