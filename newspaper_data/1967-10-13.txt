Muir College has officially 
opened. Last Friday's convo-
cation in Matthews Campus, 
according to Provost John Ste-
wart marked the beginning of 
UCSD's second college. 

A crowd of 1000 guests, uni-
versity personnel and students 
attended the event, at which 
Robert Penn Warl'en, noted nov-
elist and poet, gave the keynote 
address. 

Stewart introduced the tlve 
"honorary fellows" of Muir 
College and preserted them wlth 
the certificates of their award. 

The five fello s are Ernest

Cal'eteria Crisis 
MovestoSo/ution 

"To be boDest, as this world goes, is to be one man picked 
out or ten tbousaDd."--Sbaltespeare, 'Hamlet,' Act 0, Sc.2 

Many students on campus ha'le deeried the change In admis-
sion policies of the cafeterias as a cbanp 10 the educational 
ideals of UCSD. Now that tbe commuters aod resident students 
haYe been "segregated" lnto separate d1nlng balis, accord1ng to 
an arbitrary price of a meal, we are now a split student body 
db llttle contact between the two groups. U is furtber impossible 
for faculty and staff members to sit down wltb students durlDg 
meals. or even betwten meals, and discuss questioos of our ace· 
As one AS senator puts it, we can't even look at the mural 10 
the Revelle Cafeteria without paying addmissioo. We seem to 
haYe a police state on campus, 10 wbicb one must ~bOw bis card 
to be fed, and without a meal card, one must eat 10 an lnterior 
area of the camous. i.e.tbe Snack Bar and the BamDoor. 

What these critics faD to explain is the reason for tbis cbange 
10 policy and manner 10 wbich it was instituted. Prophet Food 
Co., according to the FinaDcial Office, lost approximately $25,000 
durlDg the last academic year. 'Because this concern is a profit-
seeklDg organization, sucb aloss cannot be withstood for long. 
An lnvestigation into the nature of tbis loss revealed that the 
food wb1ch non-paYlnc customers re ceived, either throucb tbe 
courtesy of tbeir dorm frieods or througb their own disbonest 
actions, made up the majority or tbis amount. Togetber witb Aux-
Wary Enterprises, Dean Murphy and various others 10 the admln-
istration, Propbet Co. sought a means of limiting these actions. 
The present set-up is certainly not perfect, but despite all in-
quiries into the matter. no better solution could be found. Even 
the efforts of Provost Saltman to cbaJlce the poUcy were for naught. 
The basic problem, then, is bow Prophet Co. can work 10 the 
black U students and others cheat their fellow studen s. 

The word "cheat" is here quite appropriate. According to 
Mr. Norr 10 Auxiliary Enterprises the food bill included 10 the 
dormitory fees is based on the actual amount of food one student 
will ut 10 a week. Taken into accound, be said, are the facts 
that all residents do not eat three meals a day, seven days a week 
(notwitbstandlng the two meals offered on Sunday); that they wUl 
not consistently ask for second servings; that they wUl periodically 
go borne for the weekend or eat at the BarnDoor once in a while; 
and that women eat less than men and usually eat more of the less 
caloric foods than the men. Thus when a student does not eat 
seconds, or goes home for a couple of days, or sleeps through 
breakfast, be is not really loslng money but rather is followlog 
the "formula" already figured lnto tbe $984 payed for room and 
board. If this student, however, takes seconds oot gives them to 
bis commuter friends, or the commuters sneak into the cafe-
teria and take food not paid for, they are upsetting the overall 
balance expected in such a large operation. As a result of these 
devious larks, the price of living on campus must go up, as high 
as $150 more, to compensate for these few students, or the qual-
ity of the food and service must go down (if that is possible), or 
the admittance policies must be altered. 

Mr. Norr said that UCSD's seating policies were unique 10 the 
University of California last year--at all other campuses the 
residents non-residents are segregated into specified dining halls. 
"Well," declare the critics, "the educational ideals at Revelle 
an d Muir Colleges are unique, too." The point is the students at 
UCSD are not unique. We have the cheats, inside the classroom 
as well as inside the cafeterias. Although the caliber of the person 
who attends UCSD may be higher, as the bookstore manager has 
found in terms of the petty thefts committed in that enterprise, 
tb e few who do make the habit of beating the system manage to 
upset it as well. 

In contrast to the critics of the new policy stand the optimists, 
who always seem to adapt to any change in the SOP's. So the 
commuters can't buy their hamburgers at the cafeteria--well, 
the BarnDoor serves better food anyway and the profits there go 
right back into the AS fund for more benefits for the student body. 
So the faculty can't discuss Vietnam or Freud in front of the color-
ful mural any longer. Well, who could hear what they said anyway, 
and isn't it more pleasant to discuss such things under the sunny 
San Diego skies in Revelle Commons and Muir patio? Further-
more, state these condoners, it is just as convenient to meet 
friends outside the cafeterias as it is inside. 

One can naturally find numerous arguments to justify either 
side of the controversy. But the major facts remain: (1) Prophet 
lost money; (2) there are 800 more students on campus, exc luding 
any additional staff. faculty, and visitors who like to eat lUlich 
every day; (3) the e~ ting facilities have not markedly grown enough 
to allow for the sane policies as last year, when a student could 
eat anywhere on ca npus, and (4) UCSD would face the same sit-
uation if it were in chArge of the food service. 

New ideas, nevert leless , are being presenlo:d to tM AS Senate 
Dean Murphy and ewryone else concerned to change the new status 
quo. The idea ot a trial period next month which would te s t /the 
honor code that the .\S Senate and Interdorm Council are strength-
ening may prove the best policy. But again, it is up to the students 
and all other peoplf on campus to make whatever new policy is 
Instituted work. The main cafeterias in Revelle and Muir could 
be opened up to ev~ryone tomorrow if the residents were willing 
to forfeit their unlimited seconds privUege. But by all present 
indicatlons, they adamantly refuse to relinquish this hard-fought-
for right. 

Any solution, in conclusion, must attempt to solve the two prob-
lems of financial loss and increased student population. We can 
experiment all we want, and perhaps there Is an untried procedure 
that will please everybody. But the honesty of the student body 
is basic to any system. Regardless of the everpresent few who 
rebel against the necessary rules imposed "n all for the sake of 
each, the majority of the sane, clear-thinking student body must 
realize that it Is their responsib1llty to insure the success of any 
reforms the administration-student "Ad Hoc" committee enacts.

Dear EdItor: 

After two years of a severe 
drought here at UCSD a slight 
respite has saved many stu-
dents from self-destruction. 
To the males it is a time 
for merriment and rejoicing. 
To the females, however, it 
is a time for sadness and de-
spair. Nevertheless, we thank 
you, Provost, and we thank 
all of the other people res-

ponsible for the event. But mo-
st of all we want to thank 
all of the girls who ha.-e cho-
sen UCSD as their home base 
for 1967-68 operations, forthey 
have made this happening pos-
sible. Yes, the female sex has 
at last arrived at UCSD in 
sufficient numbers, and it is 
the heartfelt hope of the wri-
ters of this article that they 
are most detinately here to 
stay. 

Affectionately written,

What is Actors Quarter? U is, 
or course, a theatre company, 
but it is different in both goals 
and repertory from commercial 
theatres and most other com-
mUnity theatres as well. It dU-

in tbat it presents signUieant 
contemporary plays without ap-
ology, or sugar-coating. It frank·

In both plays and players, Ac-

Actors Quarter does seek to

But it is a theatre· of lovolYe-
ment---it does not sbr1nlt from 
the concrete social, political, 
and moral Issues or our time. 

Actors Quarter is an ensem-

In it. in its beglnn1ngs, theatre

If you're geared for the ad-
venture at spendlng three or 
four months 10 the Okavango 
Swamps in the Uny country 
of Lesotho in Southern Africa 
on not much more tban 2 to 
3 dollars per day, then there 
is a graduate student 10 AMES 
who you shouid get 10 touch 
with. 

He Is lam Malcolm Hirscb-
sobo, a ZS-year-old South Af-
rican born 10 Jobannesburgwho 
is going back to his homeland 
10 two years to try to conquer 
the .Okavango Swamps by Jeep. 

Go on tile safari, aod you too 
may meet a glrde face tofaee! 

To loterestpeople and answer 
questions concerning the saf-
ari, Hirscbsobo has scheduled 
a public meetlng and slide sbow 
of his past trips for 8:00 pm 
Tuesday, October 17, in room 
2622, Undergraduate Sciences 
Building at UCSD. 

The safari is scheduled for 
the summer of 1969. It will 
be winter 10 Africa and that 
area's most favorable season. 
Hirscbsobn feels tbat It w111 
lake the neIl two years to 
plber equipment and to tram 
aod condition the safari mem-
bers. 

Those who are golng should 
nod their vehicle s within the 
next two months and begin to 
fix tbem up. They can be 10 
any sbape when purchased, Hir-
scbsobn said, but they must 
be in top shape when they are 
shipped to Africa. 

Hirscbsollll's safari will be 
a researcb trip. U might 10-
clude biological studies of the 
various plants aod animals 10 
the area, or a survey or the 
pologlea1 structure. Hirschs-
oIID is already sure of one com-
panion, a geophysics student 
from PurGJe Unlversity, who 
wants to do refraction studies 
10 the swamp area.

Cftester Nimitz Facility 

Provides Sertfts 

For Scripps FI.et 
One of the world's finest 

sbore bases for supporting oc-
eanograpblc researcb, the '1 
mnlion Cbester W. Nimitz Fa-
cility of Scrjpps provides ber-
thing space for tbe entire 9 
vessel Scripps researcb fleet. 
Named for the late Fleet Admi-
ral Nimitz, tbe Marine Faclll-
ty rests on six acres of land 
leased from the U.S. Navy, on 
tbe Sao Diego Bay side of pt. 
Loma. Amoog the facillties 
are offices, workshoPS. ware-
houses, slUp's stores. and sci-
entific aDd technical equipment 
laboratories. 

Expedition (Eastropac). The 
largest ship in the neet. Argo is 
able to sustaiD a 32 man crew 
and a scientific party of Z4 for 
60 days or 8000 miles. 

"October IS. 19i'l 

cbatrmao of the department 01 
oceaoocraPbY at Sc~ and 
an internationally kDown res-
earch oceaaograpber. Is the 
coordinator for Eastropac and 
for seve ral months has been re-
lieved of some of his Scripps 
duties to map the program. 

While the seeODd Door of tbe 
lO,400-s(Jlare foot admlDlstra-
tion bundlng is the centrallllb 
of tile mariDe facUlty's opera-
tioos, tbe ground Door provides 
tbe necessary office space to 
plan ltiDerarles and operatioos 
of the floating eJpeditioos. Near 
by, machine, electrooic and e· 
lectric shops oeeupy a 16,000 
square foot warehouse. Inthese 
sbops, radar, sonar, lorans and 
similar e<JIipment are desigDed 
for use by the Scripps Deet. 

The smaller, white craft sho-
wn to tbe right of Argo is the ne-
west addition (Feb. 1966) to tbe 
Scripps Deet. This vessel, the 
Alpba Helix, Is essentially an 
ocean-going laboratory that 
provides a modern, fuUy-equfp-
ped blolocfcal station for work 
in any part of the world. It was 
donated by tbe National Science 
Foundation, togetber with a sup-
porting shore laboratory and 
pools. The beart of the Alpba Sumner Aua1torium is shown here on tbe Scripps Oceanograpbic Researcb Institute just to tbe right 
Helix is her laboratories. She ~~Of.s.v.e.rdru_p~Hal_I' ____ ~ __ III!!!!!II ______ I111!!!!~ _____ ~."~~_ 

In announcing Dr. Wooster's 
appointment to head Eastropac, 
Donald L. McKernan, BCF dir-
ector in Washington, said a 
main goal oC tbe study is to 
gain from knowledge of the 
relatiooslUp between ocean con-
ditions and tuna and marlin 
resources In the area to be 
investigated, itself many times 
the size of the United States.

As the oceanographic branch 
of the University of California, 
San Dieco, Scripps Institute oC 
Oceanography has earned a 
worldwide reputation as one of 
the best and most important 
centers for research and.gra-
duate training in marine sci-
ences. 

The Institution is adjacent 
to the main campus of UCSD, 
,DD tbe sOOre of tbe Pacific 
Ocean. just north of La Jolla. 
Dr. William A. Nierenberg, 
formerly professor of physics 
at tbe University of California, 
Berkeley, serves as Dean and 
Director of the InStitution. 

He said solutioos to many 
problems relating to Cisherles, 
weather prediction. anddeCense 
depends upon an understanding 
of tbe changing ocean environ-
ment. 

_________________________________ .. The scientific scope of the 

institution's research has gr-
own to embrace pbysical, chem-

rna. San Diego. Adjacent to 
NEL on land leased from the 
Navy is the $1 milllon Nimitz 
Marine Facility. considered one 
of the world's finest shore bas-
es for supporting oceanograph-
ic research. To financially sup-
port Scripps and its many 0p-
erations, the National Science 
Foundation and the Office ot 
Naval Research contribute ap-
prOximately 80% of the funds 
needed. Personal grants and the 
Scripps Foundation provide thE> 
r emalning capital. 

A oewly-developed, com-
plex, electroniC. sea-noor map-
piDg instrument is shown here 
with arms of the two men res-
ponsible for its design and dev-
elopment: Dwight E. Boegeman, 
Jr., and Maurice S. McGehee, 
engineers of the Marine Phy-
sical Laboratory of the Univ-
ersity of California, San Diego's 
Scripps institution of Oceano-
grapby. Called the FISH - short 
for Fully Instrumented Submer-
sible Housing - the device bas 
been successfully utUlzed to 
map the fiDe structure of the 
sea bottom in more detail than 
bas previously been possible. 

For the first 18 months of 
the program, Eastropac will 
emphasize physical, chemical, 
and biological oceanography. 
From 1968 through 1970, fishery 
investigations, including dev-
elopment ofweather forecasting 
techniques. exploration, and ex-
perimental fiShing, will receive 
major attention. 

FLIP, Scripps' unique research vessel, provides a stable platform for tile most refined oceanogra-
pbic measurements ever taken. Developed by the Marine Physical Laboratory, witb flnaoelal assis-
tance from the U.S. Navy, FLIP is iDternationally famous for its use in underwater acoustics. otller 
studies, in fields such as wave attenuation, sound propagation and bearing accuracy phase Duc-
tuatlon, have made use of FLIP's ablUties. 

WHAT EVER HAPPENED 
Baby Jean Is really a sweet 

old giri, and she's stlll as cute 
as a cuddly, marshmallow-type 
puppy dog. For all oC her good 
iooks, she's a pretty impor-
tant young lady, especially wben 
you consider that sbe is only 
four years old. Last year Vice-
President Humphrey and Calif-
ornia's Governor Brown came 
all tbe way to her home in 
La Jolla )1st to say 'hello'.

Her popularlty bas tended 

to give her a complex. All 
she likes to eat Is exotic food. 
Once she sam pied a leather 
shoe, nibbled on some flash 
buibs, and swallowed down an 
empty baby bottle. Who is our 
mystery lady? WIlY. only tbe

Baby Jean, wbo Uves in ber 
own ring tank down at PRL 
(Physiology Research Lab at 
Scripps), was brougbt Into cap-

was caught less tban ten miles 
from San Diego's sbores by 
a joint ettort of UCSD and '

well as biological studies. Con-
tinuing investigations are con-
ducted of the topography and 
composition of the ocean bot 
tom, of waves and currents, 
and of the flow of heat and 
interchange of matter between 
seawater and the ocean bottom 
or the atmosphere. 

Scripps' own research ships 
have extended the geographiC 
scope from the institution's own 
beach and adjacent coastal wat-
ers to ali the world's oceans. 
Nine oceanographic research ' 
vessels are in operation, and 
otbers are being planned. Ad-
ditional laboratory space is 
provided by the U.S. Navy on 
the grounds ot the Navy Elec-
tronics Laboratory in Point La-

Graduate education is pro-
vided througb six curricular 
programs - biological oceano-
graphy, physical oceanography. 
marine biology. mar ine geol-

geophysics - conducted by tbe 
Department oC the Scripps in-
stitution of Oceanograpby. The 
general research effort is cen-
tered in three Divisions, des-
ignated Ocean Research, Mar-
ine Biology, and Eartb Scien-
ces. The diversity of their work 
is extended by three Federally 
sponsored laboratories -- the

equipment are avallable tor tho-
se desiring such activities as 
weight-Wting, gymnastics 
wrestling,karate, and traillpo-'

PhYI. Sci. Seq.

S1nee tile last school year, 
more thought bas been applied 
to how the Physical Science re-
quirements can be madebeara-
ble for tile enteriog students ha-
Ying weak matbemaUcs prepar-
ation. TIle new name, Natural 
ScieDCe Se<JJence, is only tile 
title of a revised series of sci-
ence courses. TIle appropriate 
sequeDee leve11s cbosen accor-
ding to ooe's performance of tile 
matbematics placement test be-
Id this week and one cprter of 
UCSD math york. 

For the eaerlng fresbmeo, 
tile Natural Science Sequence 
bas tile following pattern: a math ' 
plac:emeDt eDlD puts blm in the 
Math lor Matb 2secpmee.De-
pending on the results of one

slcned math sequence. he deter-
mines wblcb Natural Science

stlcation. Alab session 1nd1ca-

so iDcluded in only tile upper le-

per leye1 scieDceseqaenee. The 
other Idea Is that tbe student 
could apply tor tile provost's 
approval to enter into the se-
quence even though be bas not 
sutflcieDtly met the mathema-
tics re¢ement. 

The Natural ScIence sequeo-
ces represent the eoosoUdation 
of three different departmeDts 
on campus. Although no 0118 de-
partment oversees tbe entire

WHAT IS TOOK? 

SPECIAL COLLECTION 
CONTAINS TREASURES 

There are some Uttle-pub-
licized treasures on the Spe-
cial Collection sbelves in the 
UCSD llbrary. 

One of these is Ernest Hem-
ingway's first book, publlsbed 
by a Parisian boot seller. Tbis 
first edition of 'Three stories 
and Ten Poems' Is an unim-
pressive, grey paperback whicn 
is now valued at $950 to $1000. 

Our library also owns a first 
edition copy of James Joyce's 
'Ulysses.' This book was aiso 
printed by a Parisian book: sel-
ler. 

bas DOW grOWD to iDclude ZO 
special collections. 

One of these is the M.a1n 
Rare Boot Collection. n coo-
tains mo~ of tbe books pub-
lished before 1700. The col-
lection bas a greal number of 
wrUlngs by Daniel Defoe, Sam-
uel Johnson and Niccoli Macb-
lavelll. 

An important part of Special 
Collections Is the author col-
lections. These include collec-
tions of the works of WWiam 
Blake. D.H.Lawrence, Aldous 
Huxley, Ernest Hemingway and 
Robert Soutbey. 

Tile main benefit to the stu-
dent lD this new seCJlellC8 plan 
ts Us consideration for the fresh 
man with little math prepara-
tion. For this lDdividual, tile 1 
sequeDCe begins withcllemistry 
which emphasizes an extension 
of blgb sehool algebra and bas 
DO ealculas pre-requisite. Al-
ter two courses of the sequence, 
his math knowledge has become 
.;u::tplete enough for him to eo-
ter into the physics courses in 
the sequeoce. The two courses 
require a greater math prepa-
ration and include several basic 
concepts of calculus. The final 
course in tbe sequence is bio-
logy which relies upon too know-
ledge gained in cOOmlstry and 
pbysics. 

The new cluster I Library, wbleb now contains the arts and 
music collections, Is in the same building as the new Bookstore. 

The Special Collections De-
partment, organized in 1964, 
handles these valuable works. 
At that time, it contained a 
few rare, autographed and fra-
gile old books. The Department 

The Friends of the UCSD 
Library organization has help-
ed greatly to build this strong 
and fine area collection. 

For the student with a strong 
background in math, the Natural 
Science 2 sequences provide a 
rigorous application oC mathe-
matics principles. According 
to this plan, pbysics is taught 
first, utilizing calculus imme-
diately and oHering a higher 
plane of science work thin that 
of the lower sequence. Two 
quarters of physics work gra-
duate the student to the 2 course 
chemistry se(J1ence. This two 
level course also involves cal-
culus and related concepts. 

The two level Natural Science 
sequencd finishes with one 
course in biology. 

Despite the attention payed to 
the Natural Science series of 
courses, a problem l;t W eXJSts 
for tbose who are not ;uf!icient-
ly competent in mat I and yet 
still seek a sclelllle major .

And, not surprisingly. be and

tical rather than a moral sa-
ciety and in doing so Is crea-
ting a contradiction lD Amer-
ican Ideals. 

SIL has an lnterest10gideaas 
to bow the cafeteria should be 
run. They and a great many 
others think the cafeteria should 
be open to free informal gath-
erings that promote the free 
exchange of ideas an opinions. 

The cafeteria Is only one of 
the things that SIL will be con-
cerned with tbls year. Al-
ready, they have had some of 
their people arrested for "0b-
structing traffic." whUe they 
were passing out anU-war and 
anti-draft leaflets in downtown 
Sao Diego. 

Many people don't agree with 
SIL. Its ideas, or lis aims, oot 
these "students" are doing one 
commendable thing: they are 
"participating" and using the 
plaza for its original purpose-
the promulgation of free speech 
and free Ideas.

ing to 'lour campus. We'd like to talk to 'Iou about coming to LMSC. Contact 'lour place-
ment office for an appointment. Our Interview team will be on campus October 20.
