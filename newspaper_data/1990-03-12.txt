Dispute Over Key Issuance Continues 

CO-OPS Rally to Protest Possible 
Removal from Student Center 
By ANDREA ADLEMA 
Senior Staff Writer 

Member and supporter of the 
UC D co-op held a rally on the 
gym step Friday to rai e student 
awarene of what they perceive 
a an adminis trative threat of evic-
tion due to the co-op , refusal to 
sign a contract regarding space us-
age in the Student Center. 

Several month ago. University 
enter Direc tor Jim Carruthers 

notified the co-ops in writing that 
failure to sign would result in allo-
cation of co-op pace to o ther tu-
dent-run organizations. 

The co-op cite a Dec. 5 letter 
from Carruther , which state that 
the admini tration will " hold [co-
op] space for allocation" and 
complete a " tran ition of new tu-
dent operations ... [by] June 30, 
1990," as indicating that the co-
ops would be removed if they did 

not sign the pace agreement. 
According to Assistant Vice 

Chancellor of Undergraduate Af-
fairs A. W. Russ, the "tran!>ition" 
will not occur immediately, but 
instead propo als from other tu-
dent organizations will probably 
be solicited at an un pecified time 
in the future. 

Four of the five co-ops are 
unwilling to sign the contrac t the 

administration ha offered becau e 
they feel it is not in their best 
interest. The Computer Co-op 
'igned in December. The deadline 
for the other co-op!> to ign is FrI-
day. 

The primary rea on for co-op 
disapproval of the contract is the 
key issuance and u 'age clause, 
which mandate that the co-op be

The Third College Renaming 
Committee submitted plans to the 
Third College Student Council on 
Friday for a referendum that would 
a k Third students what they would 
like thei r co llege to be renamed. 

The ballot propo ed by the 
committee Ii t Martin Luther King 
Coll ege, Rosa Park ollege, 
Sequoia College, and " no prefer-
ence" as choice for the new name. 

Thi ballot propo al wa in 
re ponse to a letter the Thi rd Col-
lege Student ouncil !>ent to the 
renaming committee on March 5, 
which recommended that the 
committee propo e a referendum 
for th April A.S. e lection to re-
quest tudent opinion on the new 
college name. 

ccording to Deni!>e Godfrey, 
a member of both the renaming 
comm ittee and Third Student 
Council, the letter was sent in re-
sponse to outcry from Third 01-
lege student!> who are 'eeki ng a 
more democratic r naming pr c-
ess. 

Third olleg\! Pr vo 't eci l 
Lytle aid he formed the renaming 
committee - composed of five 
stud nts, one alumnus, one taff 
member, and three fa ulty mem-
ber - 10 give the college a " more 
meaningful " name. The commit-
tee will forward thei r recommen-
dation to Lytle for approval. 

In ide ... 

However, many Third College 
students expressed a desire to have 
a Mice in the renaming through a 
student vote. 

Lytle re ponded that a vote of 
thi kind would be unacceptable, 
since voter turnout at mo t elec-
tions amounts to a small fraction of 
the population. 

According to Paul Lanning, a 
member of both the renaming 
committee and the student coun-
cil , the referendum submitted by 
the renamin g committee will 
merely olicit student opinion; the 
results of the vote will be trictly 
advisory. 

"There was a misconception 
among the tudents that [one of 
their] right had been taken by the 
provost" in not le tting the tudents 
vote for the renaming. Godfrey 
aid, adding that Lytle could name 

it himself if he wanted. 
Godfrey explained that by hold-

ing a town meeting and selec ting a 
renaming comm ittee, Third Col-
lege Provo tCe il Lytle wa trying 
to give tudent a voice a to the 
college' new name. 

Lanning added that Third l-
Iege faculty and slaff can al 0 vote 
in the referendum. He expres ' ed 
hope that Third College a lumni 
could take part in the renaming. 

"We would be happy to poll 
alumni if we knew that they would 
re eive ballot ," Lanning !laid. 

Lanning added that givi ng 
alumni a v te would depend on 

OPINION

Disillusionment 

whether or not money could be 
allocated to prov ide po tage to end 
ballot to alumni. 

"We don't have the money [to 
mail ballots] a a committee, [but 1 
we feel thi would be a worthy 
cost," Lanning said. 

The sludent counci l wi ll draft 
the referendum at it tonight and 
submit it as a ballot item in the 

pril A.S. election. 

Con truction of the new addi-
tion will begin during Spring 
Break, and will con ist of two 
pha e , said Boone Hellmann, 
a istant vicechancellorof De ign 
and Con truction. 

Pha e li the initial con truc-
tion of the addition , which i ex-
pected to be completed in Septem-
ber, 1991, according to Hellmann. 

Andy Howard addresses an audience on the Gym Steps 
during a noon rally to generate support for student co-ops. 

Hellmann warned student that 
the initial visual impact of the 
con truction area will be "' ho k-
ing." 

Repre, ent~tive at the Univer-
ity Communication ' office 'aid 

that "'the project will create the 
bigge t hole in the ground this 
campus has ever seen." 

The excavation site will wrap 
around the library on three ides, 
and will be 30 to 35 feet deep, he 

~a id . 
"'I want everyone to realize that 

it will be a major change, but bear 
with us. and leave final judgement 
until the project i completed," 
Hellmann aid. 

During construction, the en-
. trance to the library will be moved 
to the north side . making it more 
diffic ult for students and campus 

per~onnel to enter. 
Two concerns rai 'ed by the .S. 

Coun ilia t week about the proj -
ect were the limitation and di:-.rup-
tion oftudy 'pace and the re-
moval of eucal piuS trees. 

Hellmann a knowledged that

and tudent to minimize the in-
convenience.

Graduate Students Discuss Co-ops, RIMAe, and Lab Policy 
By ATHERINE DILLE 
News Ediw/' 

Graduate Student Association 
members voted last Wednesday 
ni gh t on several resolutions, con-
cerning issues including co-op 
space agreements and UC ties with 
labs, and discussed the recently-
pa sed RIMAC referendum. 

Graduate Student A sociation 
(GSA) Representati ve to the Uni-
versi ty Center Board (UCB) Paul 
Eykamp infonned GSA members 
of the board' s efforts to mediate 
between the UCSD administration 
and co-op in regard to Student 
Center 'pace agreements. 

According to Eykamp, a di s-
pute arose when the co-ops took 
is ue wi th a sec tion of the Student 

enter space agreement that re-
quired them to be on the university 
)."ey system. The co-ops cited pa t 
\ecurity problems a sociated with 
the uni versi ty system .1> the rea,on 
why they would nOI sign the agre-
ment, Eykamp sa id. 

After hearing both the co-op~ 
and the university 'S views, the 
board decided to support the co-
op's position because "the univer-
sity showed no compelling rea on 
to suppon the ir views," he said. 

Several GSA members asked 
what authority the UCB actua lly 
has over Student Center deci ions. 

Eykamp responded that, in thi s 
case, the board is fu nctioning in an 
advisory role to Vice Chancellor 
of U ndergraduate Affairs Joseph 
Watson. 

"Now the ball is fimll y in the 
court of Joe Watson," he said. 

Eykamp said that "everything 
the board has requested has been 
granted until now." 

The GSA mcmbers then passed 
a resolu tion which expressed their 
SUppOlt for the U B's position. 

On the subject of RIMA C, ev-
eral GSA members expressed an 
interest in insta lling a system for 
pecial referendums where the job 

of infonning stude nts on the pos i-
ti ve and negative aspects of pro-
po ed projects is not in the hands 
of tho e making the proposal - in 
thi s case, the RIMAC Committee. 

GSA Vice Pres ident Randy 
Gi les reported that 440 of 2,300 
eligible graduate sllldents had voted 
in the special referendum. 

"Graduate s tudents clearly 
didn ' t have an intere. 1 in voting," 
Giles sa id. 

One GSA member suggested 
that perhaps graudate tudent voter 
turnout was low because many 
graduate students do their work at 
home and wcre unaware of the 
referendum. It was propo ed that 
~tuden t~ be noti tied by mail during 
fu ture spccial referendums. 

Graduate studen ts then di s-
cussed a resolution proposed by 
Labwatch, a UC Santa Barbara-
based group, which called for the 
UC to sevenies with the Lawrence 
Livemlore and Los Alamos labo-
ratories. 

In opposi ton to the proposal, 
Gi les infonned the group that he 
had visited the Lawrence Liver-
more Lab that Monday and had 
seen that the labs "are involved in 
a lot of wonhwhile acti vi ties." 

Gi les said that "having seen the 
kind of thing that goes on there .. . 
the university has a more benefi-
cial relationship with the labs than 
another non-profit or for-profi t 
group could have. 

"It basically boil s down to a 

moral issue of ' 00 we want the 
University involved with nuclear 
weapons research?,' " he said. 

Eykamp pointed out that the 
UCS D-based In tillite for Global 
Con fli ct and Cooperation, which 
was formed as a counterbalance to 
the labs to sllldy ways to reduce 
g lobal conflict , i funded in part by 
money generated by both of the 
labs. 

Graduate student David Fre-
mont responded by saying that the 
factthar some groups receive "fall -

According to Hellmann, 246 
trees will be removed during con-
slruction , 25 percent of which are 
di ea ed. He added that the current 
policy is to plant o ne tree fo r every 
tree that is removed. 

In this project, however, the 
landSl ap i ng around the library will 
be markedly diffe rent from its 
present appearance, s ince it wi ll be 
impossible to replant tall trees on 
too of the library add ition. 

out" money from the lab ' should 
not have any bearing on the moral 
issue of whether or not the UC 
should be involved in nuclear 
weapons development. 

Another graduate student said, 
"it would be nice to send a message 
to the U.S. government that we 
don't need these labs anymore ... 
we need disarmament talks." 

Graduate student Rod Corriveau 
advocated UC involvement wi th 
the labs becau e " the academic 
community has a moral responsi-

which he says is the admini-
stration 's responsibili ty. 

Although it is the ba is of the 
connict, key issuance wa not the 
main theme of Friday 's rally, at-
tended by about 75 . 

The speakers focused instead 
on issues of tudent empowermelll 
and tudent decision-making when 
student fees are involved. Noting 
that the llIdent Center is funded 
by student fees, several speaker 
called for student control of the 

Instead, the landscape design-
ers have created a park-like selling 
with plant , benches, and paths. 
The area surtounding the library 
will contain a major plaza fronting 
the Central Library entrance and 
sculptures on the south side. On 
the nonh side, native canyon vege-
tation will be planted to blend with 
the canyon, Hellman said . 

The underground design was 
created by Gunnar Birkets & As-
sociates Inc., and was chosen so as 
to not obscure o r mar the original

The GSA eventually voted not

calling for the end of UC manage-

Encouraging passer -by to stop

Nicaraguan Election 

Reform In Jeopardy 
The future of icarag ua appears bleak. The elat ion over the 

election of Violeta Chamorro IS fading quickl y, and the new 
admini tration face many dauming problems. Not the least of 
the e is the relu tance of the Sandinistas to bow to the will of the 
people and effect a mooth transition . 

The Sandinistas spent millions campaigning for Daniel Ortega, 
the American media was convinced they would ail to victory. 
But the di ati faction with Sandinista mismanagement and re-
pre sian wa strong; the voters could not be bought. 

It's easy to forgel in a n age of predominantl y peaceful revolu-
tion in Ea tern Europe that communist thug don 'tlike to give up 
power. Statements from members of the andini ta regime are 
laced with subtle and overt threat: mentions of po si ble vio-
lence. distribution of free weapons to civilian, and demand that 
the "goals of the revolution" not be renounced. 

But renouncing tho e goal is precisely what the people of 
icaragua de ire; they certainly don't want a rerum to the days 

of omoza. but they clearly want deliverance from the di aster of 
Marxist-Leninist economics. The New ReplIhhc report that 
"The Sandinistas had pre ided over the economic destruction of 

Nicaragua: a ruined export economy; a 90 percent drop in living 
standards; mas ive unemployment and hunger; the exodus of 
nearly a fifth of it, people, including most of its skilled workers 
and professionab .. .. " 

Sandinista apologisb pomt to U.S. pressure as the cause of 
these troubles . This IS a weak argument, however, since there 
isn't auccessful MarAist economy in the world, and there is 
hardly reason to belteve icaragua would have been the excep-
tion were it not for the big. bad United States. 

The people of icaragua weren '( fooled b) that argument. Ln-
fortunatel). tt may all be for nothing. Samlinistas have threatened 
vtolence if the Contras are not demobtlil.ed, and have reportedly 
been handmg out weapons to ,>upporrcrs. The Sandtnista~ are also 
frantically attempting to pass laws, including a general amnest) 
act. which would vtrtually paraly/e the nc\\ government. 

A pamlYl.ed govet IlIllCllt would be -- if it is possible - worse 
than the Sandinl'>tas The icaraguan econom) is 111 shambles, 
and the Ortega regIme systematically weakened the ,>oeiety's 

in~tJtution!'> in a;' effo/1 to ma!..e the statc supreme. RebuIlding 
will be difficult in any circum tances; with resistance perhaps 
armed -- from the andintstas. it may bc imposstble. 

That is precisely what the Sandinistas wan\. The opposi tion 
promised prosperity. and if they fail to deliver, the andinbtas 
can step tn Wilh a new revolution perhaps democrat ie, perhap,> 
not. Either way, icaragua will be worse of! than before, and will 
be sliding once agatn down the latled comm uni t path. 

Thts fate may be avoided with the help of the rest of the free 
world and the SovIet Union, and a clear-headed .5. policy 
dtrected toward assisting democracy 0 matter \\ hat the rest of 
world does, however. the future of icaragua as always 
resh with the NIcaraguan peoplt.: Il opefu ll y they will beat the 
odds. 

Muir Students Outraged At Stereotypes 
Editor : 

I am writing th b letter in re-
sponse to the letter regarding M uir 
freshpersons and Muir College. 
(",Egoti stical Morons at Muir". 
March 5) I am a Muir College 
freshperson and took great offense 
at the blatant generalities and un-
founded comments made in this 
letter. 

The argument seems to be that 
tho e student attending Warren 
College are morally superior and 
humble when compared to those 
tudents attending Muir. 

I would venture to say that at 
any given campu here at UCSD, 
you will be able to find a relatively 
even number of students who you 
find offensive or below your own 
moral standards. 

At the same time, there will be 
a number of students who do meet 
your moral standard and who you 
would be able to get along well 
with. 

It sounds as though you take 
offen e at the jokes people make 
about how far dining facilities are 
from Warren College. 1 am sure 
that if you request that your 
"friend" from Muirnot make the e 
comments. (s)he would ccase and 

po~sibly apologize. However, 
these jokes you take ·uch offense 
in are only humor. 

o one is claiming that you 
will receive a les er education at 
Warren College because you live 
fu rther away from the dining fa-
cilities. If you continue through 
life with such a grim sense of 
humor and out look, you are bound 
to encou nter all sons of people 
you are not going to get along 
with. 

This brings up my next point. 
You call all male students at Muir 
"ass hole .. and all fema les 
"sleazy," You base all of these 
assumptions on your encounter. 
with maybe five students at Mui r. 
I wish you would point out to me 
these women strutting about in 
their underwear. I have been li v-
ing in the Muir ReSidence Halls 
for an entire year and have yet to 
see half naked women roaming 
freely about hitting on any person 
they happen to encounter. 

How can you make these gen-
erali ti es based only on your lim-

BENSON 

ited experiences at Mu ir? 
Next, your colorful u e of ad-

jectives lasshole, sleazy) can onl y 
lead one to believe that you have a 
fi rm grasp on the English lan-
g uage and are able to mature ly 
convey your ideas. 

You act in your letter as if you 
could actually pick a Muir tudent 
o ut of a line-up. I have friends 
from several of the UCS D col-
lege , and we' re all different 
people. 

r don't believe that the colleges 
have al tered out individual pe r-
sonalities so m uch that where one 

studen t used to be a great person 
and fun to be around, now (s)he is 
mora ll y corrupted and egotis tical. 

In your future whinings, try to 
be more pecific about your tar-
get. I am sure I speak for many 
when I ay that J, as a Mui r 01-
lege st udent , take offense in your 
rambling . 

P.S. Guardiall Edi tors: How 
could you even consider pri nt ing 
this kind of garbage in your news-
paper? 

At least try to find literate let-
ters. 

Robert Howard 

Complaints Must Cease 
E ditor: 

J have noticed, in the last few year and pan icul arly since I trans-
ferred to UCS D. that people sure like to do an extraord inary amount of 
complaining. Here on campus the studen ts like to complain about 
pa rking, fees, and the administra tion. I would like to address those of 
you who are the most vocal: hut up. 

How can students complain about parking on thi campus? If you 
don ' t like the co t then don ' t buy the penn it. And what did you expect, 
your own personalized space right next to all of your classes? Get real, 
people. If you want parking fees. go downtown and pay eighty bucks a 
month to park under a bank. Yes, it costs money to park , but relatively 
the cost is quite low. And as many are quick to point out, the faculty gets 
the choice pots on campus and there are always pace in their lots. [f 
1 were an instructor here and had to put up wi th some of the wet-nosed 
whining brat that pa~s them;elve off as tudent , I would demand. at 
the least. decent parking. 

A, far as the fees go, everyone liI-.es 10 mention that they pay for this 
chool 0 they should ge t what they want. I've got some news for you 

people, you don ' t pay diddly. For a major univer ity such as th is, our 
fees our nothing. [f you really want to complain about paying fees 
transfer to Stanford. 

Are you ti II wonderi ng why the administrat ion dec ided 10 screw-up 
Urey lawn? Is another build ing really necessary? Ask this, people: 
would you be here today if the university had quit adding to the campus 
in '72? Enrollment keeps going up. and as long as new suckers keep 
applying, new buildings will continue to be bui lt. Of course they could 
put the new building on the other side of [-5, bu·t don't bitch when you 
have ten minutes to run two milcs to get to class. 

This seem s to cover the majority of the complaints that surface for no 
apparent reason other than the fact that some people need to bitch all of 
the time. [ will not deny that there are several problems in the above 
areas that need to be addressed, but writing letters to the edi tor com-
p[aining about the problem does nothing towards solving it. If you 
people are really interested inkeeping contro l of thi s school in the hands 
of the student then do something. You can all start with voting. If you 
don 't vote, that's just as good as telling the R egents that they own us. 

The next time you want to complain about someth ing, remembe r: 
Ihey could bulldoze your favorite parking lot tomorrow, our fees could 
reflect the quality of our educational opportunity and be thousands 
more, and they ' ]] probably raze your dorm next just to shut you up. 
Instead of complaining a bout it, think about the problem objectively and 
wri te to your e lected representative with a viable solution.

'The Hollow Men': The Disillusionment Of A First-Year Student 
By BEN BOYC HUK , Associate Opillion E ditor 

We are tlie IlOl/ow men 
We are the slI/ffed men 
Lealling togetlier 
Headpiece fi lled with straw. Alas! 
My firs t year at co llege has been an amazing, enlighten-

ing, yet profoundly disturbing experience. My initial months 
here were a festive time. Panies-were easily fo und, alcohol 
fl owed freely. people were excited. But with the advent of 
midtemlS, certain academic realities took ho ld, and with 
that, certa in social rea lities became apparent as well. 

Shape without form , shade wit/lOut color 
Paraly:edforce. gesture without motion. 
In high school, I was a bit of an anachronism. I fe lt like 

I was 30 in a Iinle nation run by toddlers. ] didn ' t like the 
high school soc ial life much, a nd it didn ' t like me. The 
ridiculous parties each weekend were one thing. I d idn ' t 
have to go to those. What disturbed me wa the attitude that 
there are the "cool" and the "uneool," the "accepted" and 
the " unaccepted." Unfortunately, those terms could mean 
anyth ing to any panicul ar group. What disturbed me more 
was to watch good people, wi th ensible values and creative 
minds, se ll o ut their consciences for the prive lege of ac-
ceptabili ty. 

I thanked God when I /i.0t out. 
For some strange reason, I expected co llege to be to tally 

differen t. I had visions of an academic and social "Xanad u .. 
where I could partake ot honeydew and drink the milk of 
paradise. I counted down the days , until fi na lly, the great 
day came, and I moved on campus. My God, !' d never been 
more excited. My dream had fi nally come true. 

For a time, r though t I was happy. I thought 1 had fo und 
my place in paradise at la t. Butthe honeydew overripened, 
the mi lk became sour, and I suddenly realized that ] had 
been terrib ly, terribly naive. 

This is rhe dead land 
This is the cactus land 
Here the slone images 

Hawaii's East-West Center 
and 

Are raised, here tl,ey receil'e 
The supplicatioll of a dead ilia,, ' s hand 
Under the twinkle of a fading star" 
The consequences of my naiv ity have been devastating. 

I realize now that I am livi ng in a donn spl intered into 
several factions. Dislike and disun ity run rampant. My 
suite virtually cut everyone off from the outset. Our fellow 
residen ts were judged, fou nd gui lty, and convic ted very 
quickly. Nobody ever had a chance. Animosity runs deep 
to th is day. 

Bickering, senseles and misinfonned gos ip. os tra-
cism- all became the norm. Everyth ing I had despised and 
eluded in high school had fi nally caught up with me here. 

GuAimIAN Cl@..-up 
, 

I wasn' t drinking the m ilk of paradise at a ll ... I was 
drinking fro m the very cesspool of lies I had fough t so hard, 
and so successfully, to resist a few months before. Luckily, 
I caught myself. We've made so many mi takes, taken so 
much fo r granted, lost so many friendship opportunities, 
and worst of all , wasted so much time. Now 1 am trying to 
repair the damage I helped cause, if only little by little. 

It doesn' t take a genius to rea lize that the very same 
people I deplored in high chool would be most of the same 
people I would encounter in college. These are the same 
people who dic tated what was right and what was wrong to 
those who felt it imperative to li sten, Ie t they be judged 
" unacceptable." It 's almost as if they've come to get those 
of us who managed to escape them in high school. 

The eyes are not here 
There are no eyes here 
III this valley of dying stars 
III this hollow valley 
This brokenjaw of ollr lost kingdoms 
College is a place where great freedom can be exercised. 

For many of us, we 've never had access to so much 

freedom. Forsome, it is a time to throw caution to the wind. 
" Eat, drink. and be merry, for tomorrow we shall die!" For 
those of us who did not have such freedoms at home. the 
temptation is amazingly great to literally become drunk on 
the freedoms offered to us here. 

But with freedoms come responsibi lties, and those 
constraints which our consciences place upon us. 

It saddens me to see that so many of u have fallen. We 
were so strong. We never yielded to the pressures o f high 
school. ] thought we would rather die than surrender. 

But the temptations are so beau tiful. To be able to -
exercize unbridled personal and sexual freedom is a very 
attractive offer, indeed. To at last assert ourselves, without 
the burdensome supervision of our damned. meddling 
parents. To fina lly break free from home's repressive 
chains. To at last experience unlimited, unknown pleas-
ures. 

But every thing has its price. For those of us who fought 
aga inst confo rmity, agains t ostracism, against j udgement, 
that price is our ouls. 

I cannot and will not judge the lifestyles of others. For 
some, hedonism is a path they have chosen to trave l. For 
others, a life devoted to God is their chosen way. There are 
millionsoflifestyles to choose from , and it would be wrong 
to condone or condemn anyone in particular. because each 
person has to seek out his or her own fonn of happiness. 
Coercing people into a way of life that goes against every-
thing they believe in is not just wrong. it's destructive. 

III this last of meeting places 
We grope lOge/her 
And avoid speech 
Gathered 0/1 this beach of the IlImicl river 
That, I be lieve. is just a partofthe problem with life here. 

We, the fut ure of America and the world, have sunk into a 
collective mediocrity. Motivation is slowly but surely 
slipping away. We, the "Best America Has", are not the best 
anymore.

Murder Story Was Dangerous and Distasteful 
Editor: 

I'm responding to the article 
"UCS D Woman Found Murdered 
rn Her Clairemont Apartment," 
splashed over the front page of 
Feb. 20 issue of The Guardian. r 
feel the art icle ' s conten t disp layed 
poortaste on the paper's part, and 
the article for the front cover was 
an invasion of Janene Weinhold's 
privacy to announce her personal 
life as it was. 

t picked up an issue late Tues-
day afternoon and skimmed the 
headlines, expecting to see an 
article about the Regents planning 
a new building for campus. In-
stead, the article regarding Wein-
hold quickly got my attention, and 
I had to finish reading it once I 
started. This article was so out of 
character for The Guardian that it 
gave me a scare. This is my third 
year here at UCSD, and dreadful 
happenings such as assaults and 
murders are publicized at all times 
at the Women's Resource Center 

Disillusion 
Continued from page 5 

We' ve lost our spirit. 
Somewhere along the way, 

omeone forgot to instill us with 
the values, e thics. and ideals of 
o ur forefathers. We, the youth of 
today, have forgotton honor. We 
have lost re pect for each other 
and ourselves. We are manipulat-
ive. We play with each-others' 
minds like pawns on a chess boarq.. 
We are an uncaring, unfeeling 
ociety. We are a society wracked 

by violence, fear, and despair. 
How can we, the future, expect 

to deal with such huge problems 
as drugs, debt, and crime, if we 
can't relate to each other? We, the 

and at the provost's office. 
WI erea The Guardian, which 
has the larges t circulation on 
campus, has publicized neither 
type of case until thi s article, which 
was a l 0 done in poor taste. The 
sty le of the article wa n't infor-
mative by giving the facts and 
ways to prevent such a tragedy 
but was written to scare UCSD 
women. 

It was very important to in-
form us of this malicious fata lity, 
but the paper had no business to 
bri ng us into this young woman's 
world and allow us to know her 
personal doings. The article made 
us get to know this girl, which 
enabled us to relate our I ives to 
hers , which brought the situation 
too close to home. It made thou-
sands ofUCSD girls fear for their 
lives Tuesday nigh t. Every girl 
who read the articlt:, including 
my elf, locked all door and win-
dows and checked them three 
times to ensure their safety, I 

future , are encouraging our own 
destruction, by not allowing our-
selves, as individuals , to assert 
ourselves as individuals. We are 
so caught up with trying to con-
form to some social norm, but I'll 
be damned if I don ' t know just 
what that norm is. 

Do any of us? 
And if we do , why can't we ee 

all of the harm it is causing? 
It 's as though our soul s have 

been eaten away, from the core 
out, leaving us shells of what we 
once could have been. 

Now, as we try so hard to be 
socially conscious, to help those 
less fortunate than our elve , we 
fail to see that those who are truly 
the victims of misfortune are our-

lt was very important that this 
tragedy was brought to everyone 's 
attention and that we're aware of 
the evils in this world, but the 
approach to this article was dis-
tasteful by splashing iton the front

GO BACK TO THE PAST 
Group Attempts to Recreate the Middle Ages 

Robert Me/son, a member of the Society for Creative Anachronism, demonstrates the use of his weaponry. 

Historical Accuracy Stressed; 
No 'Trolls and Pixies Among Us' 
• tory By Doreen Erenea, Associate Features Editor 

The flap~ of the colorful tent~ were blowing in the wind , and people 
were in dressed in costumes that should only have existed in history 
OOol-.s or paintings - ranging from elaborate and Intricate desigm. to 
everyday attire . A place that had been a small piece of grass next LO 
some concrete structures was transformed into something out of a 
sLOrybool-. ... or the Middle Ages. 

Walking into UCSD 's Stonehenge area on Saturday, one could 
observe valiant knights fighting in a roped-off area, as spectators 
dresed in medieval c lothing were watching and cheering. Everyone 
appeared to be in a jovial mood and enjoying the afternoon, despite the 
cloud y weather. 

It was like Mepping back in time to a period where people were 
courteous and well-mannered, addressing each other a~ "my lady" or 
" my lord." Convers3nons flowed like wine into goblets of silver. 

The impetus for this trip into the past was a tournament for the San 
Diego area Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA). organized by the 
UCSD chapter. The Stonehenge area had been iransformed into the 
Middle Ages - Joe Smith was t no longer Joe Smith; he was Sir Joseph 
Smithington of Canterbury. 

SCA members create their own persona or character that could have 
lived during the Middle Ages. One member explained that their 
personas are not based on characters from lite rature or upon historical 
figures, but instead are original creations. 

lub members invent their characters by doing research into the 
history of the Middle Ages and by trying to undl:rstand what it was like 
to live during that time period. 

Gall Johnson/Guardian 
Corina Herro, left, and Barbara Kissinger practice middle-age 
weaving. 

"[People] have a tendency LO look at medieval people as dumb or as 
savages, but they have accomplished a lot. Being in the SCA makes 
you stop to appreciate it ," said Robert Hand, who goes by the name 
Robert Carpenturas in the SCA. 

Usually, members give themselves new names and create some sort 
of history for their characters. Everyone at the tournament was called 
by his SeA name. One member 's real name is not even known to 
others in the SCA, accordi ng to another member. 

Once members create their ident ities, they make corre pondi ng 
costumes to wear to SCA events and meetings. Many of the members 
explained that their costume refl ect the time period and region their

dressed in a middle-cla~s 
busi ness man ' s costume which 
included a brown cape and a 
feather-plumed cap. 

A woman. who claimed he and 
her character were Irish, explained 
that her costume was allowed to be 
more elaborate than the o thers 
because in her character's region 
people only wore very elaborate 
and colorful dres es. Her red vel-
vet gown featured black embroi-
dery, over which she wore a thick 
grey cape with red lining. She 
explained that the wealth of jew-
el ry she wore was characteristic of 
her character's time period and 
region. 

Another woman was dressed in 
a tigh t-fi tt ing red and white gown 
with a low-cut bodice. 

She explained that her clothing 
would have been considered under-
garments in medieval England. She 
said that her dress was supposed to 
be worn only at home, and that if a 
woman of her time period were to 
go out, she would put on an outer 
skirt and wear a higher-cut bodice 
that didn't reveal as much. 

People throughout the area were 
bu ily participating in activities 
characteristic of the medieval time 
petiod. Some were weaving, oth-
ers played folkmusicon recorders. 
and some took part in fights .

heavily researched." said Pelln~ ' 
Mebon. ""ho goes by the name 
Am~r If uOlller. 

:-Vle lson said that the group put 
an em phasis on the be t a. pec t ~ of 
the :-Vliddle Age~, such as the 
empha~ i , on chivalry. 

"SCA members have a tendency 
to be on the rescue. They tend to 
help out people when they are in 
need." Melson aid. 

She told a story of how one 
SCA member stopped along the 
side o f a road to help a woman 
change her tire, and then suffered a 
heart a ttack. Melson said the group 
holds a memorial banquet every 
year for the Samaritan. 

" We all try to keep with the 
premise that we are all gentle born. 
A lor of it carrie over into our 
daily live . Manners are very im-
portant," Melson said. "You know 
you'rei n theSCA whenyou curtsy 
to your boss." 

Most SCA members belong to 
groups that take part in specific 
acti vities. The majority of the ac-
tivitie fall into o ne of three cate-
gories: fig hting, arts, and club 
organization. Probably one of the 
most visible activities of the SCA 
is the fighting. 

"We use real armor because we 
need to protect ourselves," said 
fighter Andy Deuchars, who goes 
by the name Talorc. 

Deuchars said SCA members 
use rattan wood to make weapons 
because "i t's flexible, takes im-
pact, and it breaks cleanly ," He 
also emphasized that they try to 
make the weapons as realis tic and 
as close to medieval standards as 
possible. 

Another fighter, Scott Farrell 
(Guillaume), explained that there

-Penny Melson 
Isnot a standardofskill that people 
have to meet to become lighters. 
But there i~ an authorization re-
quired for fighters, which "goes to 
show that they ' re safe on the field, 
safe to them elves. and safe to 
everyone else." 

"As long as you have an interest 
it's all right to participate," Farrell 
aid . He also explained that it costs 

about $ 100 to put a basic se t of 
armor together, but someti mes 
people wi ll spend thousands of 
dollars for their armor. 

All of the members agreed that 
anyone can fight, and that they a re 
willing to train whoever is inter-
e ted. Farrell said that even women 
can fight if they want to. 

According to the San Diego 
chapter of SCA, there are "three 
important documents that all new 
fighters should have ready access 
to." 

Th e first of these is the 
Marshal's Handbook, which con-
tains rules that must be followed 
by all kingdoms throughout soci-
ety. The second is the Marshal' s 
Handbook of the Kingdom of rhe 
Caid. This book covers the rules 
for the pecific Kingdom of Caid 
(Southern California). 

"All fighters and marshals need 
to be familiar with these rules and 
refer to [the rule 1 when getting

their equipment ready," according 
to theSCA. 

Finally, there IS a pamphle t 
written by Guillaume De La Bel-
gique called "Dumb Answers to 
the Dumb Questions Most New 
Fighters Ask. " Thi s is a practical 
guide to advice on amlOr. weap-
ons, fie ld <!tiquette. and other ') ub-
jects. 

The ballies begin in a des ig-
nated areaof a field. The announcer 
loudly addresses the audience and 
tells them which lighters are to do 
battle. The fighters get into their 
armor and choose their weapons. 
They then prepare to fight . 

However, they mu t first salute 
the throne, the person whose favor 
they bear. and the per 011 whom 
they are fighting . The fighters 
usually fight for a person in friend-
ship or for a girlfriend or boy-
frie nd. 

"Talorc is fighting for my honor 
in the field. I watch him while he is 
fighting," explained Laurie Flie-
der, a member of the UCSD SCA 
chapter. 

., Bearing a favo r is usually done 
in friend~hip, and ladies are placed 
on pedestals, so it 's a honor ," she 
said . 

Pre ent in the area are marshals, 
who are there to "make sure that 
the lighters don' t go out of the 
speci lied area. protect the observ-
ers, and [make judgment calls) if 
the fighter ask them to," aid Flje-
del'. 

But the fighters themselve 
make the final judgment as to the 
winner of the battle. According to 
Rieder, if a fighter is hit on the

con~id(;l-ed dead. 

SCA membcr\ also take part til 
a "anel}" of an fonns, including 
costulltJng. calligraphy, brewing. 
dancing, mUsil., woklng, and ~JJlg­
tIlg. 

"We try to mal-e each piece of 
art ;" ,tlltllt!ntic as possible, right 
do\.\ n to the pigment m the pamts 
and III the costumes" Farrell sa td. 

The SCA also takes part in 
organizational actt, Illes by sched-
uling banquets, toumamenls, and 
meetings. 

The SeA trie .. to recreate the 
Middle .\ges not a~ they were, but 
il\ they .,huuld have been. They are 
--devoted to learning about the 
period of history called the Medie-
val Era," according to information 
provided by Ihe SCA. 

The organization is worldwide, 
and has charter branches in Ger-
many, Sweden, and New Zealand . 
According to Baroness Elinore 
W indimere (June Ashwonh). head 
of the San Diego area SCA. there 
are nearly 100,000 SCA members 
worldwide. T he organization is 
entering its 25th year of existence. 

Within the United States, the 
organization i divided into hierar-
chical sections, the largest be ing 
kingdoms. Kingdom are usually 
states. unless the state is large, like 
California. California is divided 
into two kingdoms - the King-
dom ofCaid (Southern Cali forn ia) 
and the Kingdom of the West 
( onhern California). 

Within the kingdoms are baro- . 
nies. There are about a half-dozen 
baronies in Southern California 
alone. The San Diego barony has 
been in ex istence for 20 years. 

In addition, there are smaller 
groups within the baronies called 
cantons. The cantons are usually 
sections of the baronies divided up 
by phy ical location. T he UCSD 
campus canton is called the Col-
lege of St. Ardam is. 

" We're about two years old. 
There had been a group at UCSD 
about 15 years ago, but everyone 
in the group graduated. and there 
just wasn' t anyone left to continue 
the tradi tion," said Shannon Tor-
rey, a UCSD alumni who helped 
re- form the College of St. Ardamis. 

How to Get Involved 
The group meets the second Sunday of 
every month at the Muir Apartment 
Lounge. Phone: 698-7242.

essary 10 push UCS D over the lOp. 

The Tri ton stars inc lude Rich 
Danie ls ( ra nked fi rst in the 200 
freestyle) , Greg Goodrich (ranked 
first in the 100 backstroke). and 
Brad Thomas, who s its atop the 
500 and 1650 free~t y lc ran kings. 

The Tri tons' 400 medley re lay 
team. which fin ished firsl in lasl 
year'~ event , returns intact. They 
lead a strong group of re lay leams 
thaI i, expected to earn points for 
the challengers. 

According to Morgan, Kenyon 
is 100· 150 points better than UCS D 

on paper. However, the Tritons 
have swum well in big meets Ihis 
yea r and, wi lh their ex perience, 
150 po ints is not an unrealislic 
number to overcome. 

Morgan be lieves that Kenyon' s 
lack of depth has left the door 
slightly ajar. and that the Triton ~ 
could sneak Ihrough. Thus, the Tri· 
ton challenge could make fo r the 
mosl competilive National Cham-
pionshi p meel in years. 

" Kenyon wi ll be a big hurdle 
for us to overcome," Morgan said. 
" But, we have been preparing all 
season for Ihis mee t. 

" 1 f we arc at all capable of beat-
ing Kenyon, we will because Ih is i. 
what we have been training for. "

BASEBALL 
Continued from page 24 

Head Coach Lyle Yates aid 
that this was Rupkey's "besl show-
ing" this year. Rupkey was a sec-
ond-team All-American last sea-
son, but started slowly in his senior 
campaign. 

Tomolonis relieved and closed 
out the second game as well, earn-
ing his second save of the after-
noon. 

Yates was obviously pleased 
with Saturday's results, and said 
that the team is " right where they 
want to be." 

As Whittier is not seen as a 
contender in Divi ion [J[, Yates 
believes it was necessary for the 
Tri tons to show domination over 
the weaker Poets. 

According to Yates, Whittier 
can be viewed "a measuring stick" 
team. Yates,looking toward post-
season possibilities, think that 
UCSD, as an independent, ha to 
convinCingly beat pushover team~ 
like Whittierto put itself into good 
position for post-season consid-
eration. 

Yates also fe lt that the team 
accomplished everything it set out 
todo. Every player on the club I.wr-
tieipated in Saturday 's game:" ei-
ther at the plate or on the field . 

Starting third baseman Dave 
Ligennan, UCSD's leading hitter 
last year. showed !>ign of shak.ing 
off his early season s lump, going 2 
for 2 in the ~\!cond gam\!. 

Ot her ~tandOU ll> were SCOIOf', 
Eric Judson and J.J . Fi;,her, who 
went 4 ror 6 and 3 for 4, rel>pec 
tively, in the sweep for the Triton~ . 

U S D is now 8-7 overall and 5-
I versus Division II[ opponellt~, 
and is rank.ed 10th nationally. 

The Tritons play against a Di vi 
sian n team, Wayne State fr III 
Nebraska, 011 Monclay. 

A fter finals week. they face 
Montclair SI. and Occidental of

Yet, remini scent of a match 
against UC Irvine a few weeks

the Aztec slowly ralliedtowinthe

Despite the loss, Graybill was 
pleased with his squad 's perform-
ance. " I feel proud that we gave a 
good Divi iOIl I team all it can 
handle," Graybill said. 

Mid-Week Intercollegiate Sports Attractions ... 
The third game was played 

much like the other two, as SDSU 
team set up its shots well tak ing a 
13-7 lead over UCSD. 

Once again, however, UCSD 
was able to answer the Aztecs' bid 
for a lead with a strong rally, as the 
Tritons were able to tie the game at 
14- /4 behind Matt Brega's erv-
ing and Lamson Lam ' kill. 

However, as in the previous

For the fifth-ranked Tritons, it 
was their first dual meet since they 
finished their match against Air 
Force on February 21. 

Sunday, UCS D ran into trouble

Ditzler won hi match 6-3, 6-0. 

The other Triton winner in the

For UCSD, this match was the 
first of several in a row against 
teams from the East and the South. 

According to Monnar, these 
teams present a different style of 
play than the Tritons are used to. 

"They use a lot of top spin and 
big ground strokes. They like 10 
play the baseline a lot more. In the 
Wesl, the players usually move up 
on the net more," Monnar aid. 

The Tritons will play host to 
Eastern squads four days in a row, 
starting today with the University 
of Rochester (NY) at 3 p.m.

Men 's Lacrosse 
Recovers from 
Losing Streak; 
Beats Up On 
Manhattanville 
By MATT RASBAND 
GI/ardial/ Reporler 

-------

With an easy 15-7 victory over 
Manlmllanvi lle on Thursday. the 
UCSD men's lacrosse team ended 
a two-game 10 ing streakandupped 
its record to 7-2. 

U SD had dropped its last two 
games by a total or three goals to 
t\\' ,) of the West's top tcams, Ari -

zon ~1 (ll1d Whittier. before winning 
wi I CSD Co-Head COilCh Bob 
1 Leod termed "a reall ) loppy 

g.)tlle ... 
"We were coming off a couple 

of tough. emo ti onll l ga mes. " 
MacLeod ~aid . " I wasn't expect-
ing us to play rea lly well.lt ·s good 
to gel ba k in a winning frame of 
mind. " 

Although Macleod was not 
particu larly impressed wi th the 
Tritons' perfonnance, hi team did 
jump in front early and cruise to 
the easy victory. 

Sven Haynie, ajuniorattackman 
who had four goal and an assist, 
opened the scoringj ust 23 seconds 
into the game for the Tritons. 

By the end of the first quaJ1er, 
UCSD had built a 5-3 lead, en 
route to an 8-4 halftime edge. 

The second quarter was the Juan 
Mi llan Show, as he cored three of 
his four goals in the final five min-
utes of the quarter. All were shot 
from over 10 yards out, sneaking 
by three defenders and the goalie. 

The only difference in the-
second half was which Triton pro-
duced his own highlight film. This 
time II was senior midfielder Chri 
Hod: :e, who added three goals. 

!II acleod was impressed with 
the play of goalie Tony Prestigi-
acomo, who kept Manhallanville 
out of the game with key saves. 

According to Macleod, the 
victory wa especially sweet be-
cause Manhattanvi lle ison the East 
Coast, where lacrosse is more popu-
lar and beller established at the 
college level than in the West. 

"It feels good to play an Eastern 
team and beat them up. It shows 
that we can hold our own, " 
Macleod said.

Baseball Clobbers Whittier 10-1 and 21-4 
By MATTHEW ROCHIOS 
Sraf!Writer 

Saturday afternoon the UCSD 
men' ba eball team utilized every 
opportunity given to it in cru hing the 
Whittier College Poet 10-1 and21-4. 

In the fir t game of the double-
header. the Tritons jumped on the 
Poet for eight run in the first two 
inning. 

They literally knock.ed out the 
Whittierstarteraftertwo batter in the 
fir t. 

On a come-ba ker, Poet Brett Som-

er took a ball off the knee and wa 
unable to continue, yet pitched long 
enough to get tagged with the loss. 

UCSD' Dann Eaton (3-1) threw 
four full innings, triking out five and 
yielding only two hit. Eaton was in full 
control of the game when he dep~rted, 
but wa apparently bothered by a ore 
arm. 

Senior Rich Tomolonis came on in 
the fifth and pitched the remainder of 
the game for the Tritons, sealing the 
win and picking up his first save of the 
season. 

Whittier batter could only come up 

with four hit in the fir t game, com-
pared to the 10 UCSD managed to 
accumulate. 

The second half of the doubleheader 
featured a puni hing hitting display by 
the Triton. 

UCSD pounded Poet pitching for22 
hi t throughjust eight times at bat, scor-
ing in every inning except the sixth. 

Several players troked for multiple-
hit games, including Ernie lola (5 for 8 
on the day) in the blowout. 

UCSD' Rick Rupkey went six in-
ning to improve his record to 4-2.

Tritons Shooting for First National Crown 
By BRIA lTOW 
Senior Stal/Writer 

No team in NCAA history - not even 
John Wooden' UCLA Bruin basketball 
dynasty - has dominated its sport the way 
the Division III Kenyon College of Ohio 
men'!, swimming team has. 

Kenyon dominated the 1980 a no other 
team could. For the entire decade, Kenyon 

wimmer~ gave a new meaning to the word 
dynasry. They captured 10 straight na-

':\TIO':\L PREV)E" 
tional championships. ~etting a new NCAA 
record . And in that ~pan, they were rarely 
challenged, except by C 0 , which fin -
ished second five f the last six years. 

But this I'> a new decade, and the Triton 
men believe it could be theirs. 

U SO boa~t its est team ever. They 
have ,>everal swimmers wh have national 
experience n their sitle. They want th 
crown that has n w eluded them for three 

I years. 
For the II seniors who compris a ma-

Jority of th 17-man Triton squad that 
leaves t day for the National ham pion-
ships at Milwaukee, WI, thi" will b th ir 

last opportunity to catch Kenyon. 
"Our guy believe they have a legitimate 

chance to win," UCSD Head Coach Bill 
Morgan said. " Kenyon i the only team that 
can beat us." 

As u ua) , Kenyon is loaded with super-
tars. Yet, for the fir t time in a number of 

years, it does not have the depth that ha 
been characteri stic of its other dyna tyera 
team . 

The Tritons do. They have a number of I 
big scorers with the potential to pick up a 
lot of points. They also have a number of
