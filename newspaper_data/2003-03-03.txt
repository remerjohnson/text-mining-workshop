Fest: Five acts fight for spotlight / Computer Repair conci/wed from page I 
three performanccs showcased var-
ious rock groups. 

The first among these was Rye 
Coalition, who gave an animated 
Jnd vIgorous show. Performing 
vanous guitar-drl\cn songs like 
" wllchblade Sister," the New 
jersey group showed their love by 
rciaYlllg how far they travelcd to 
perform here at "San Diggity." The 
group proved 5uccessful in tirring 
.Ill energetic crowd, which was 

mo~h pltung and crowd-surfing to 
the hard ~ounds of the rock band. 

San Diego-ba;ed Rocket from 
the Crypt lined up their six mem-
bers to gIve an equally dynamic 
performance. Using guitars, a 
trumpet, a saxophone and even a 
tambOUrine, the group rocked the 
arena With nonstop music, hailing 
themselves as the band here to 
"save rock 'n' roll." 

Lead si nger Speedo paused 
between songs to crack jokes about 
hi~ faml blemishe and the mosh 
pll "ci rcle dance." While some in 
lhe audience found the songs to be 
raucous and overbearing, others, 
such as loU iClan j oh n Kooker, 
praised the group. 

"What I liked about the band 
was that they were rea lly tight," 
Kooker said. "It's one thing to make 
mUSIC, but It 'S really hard to make 
musIC people like listening to." 

Queens of the Stone Age, the 
festival~ headliner, were clad III all 
black and performed on a dark set 
that included blinding spotlights, 
projection of various pictures, and 
a monument of their signature egg 
and sperm symbol.

the Metropolitan Water District 
voted Feb. II to !Iuorldate their 
water supply, which reaches over 
I million people III Southern 
Callforllla - Includlllg an Diego. 
.\nd la~t October, in the name of 
provldlllg consumers With a Wider 
varlcty of produce for purchase, 
Congress passed a farm bill that 

all()\\~ all Imported fruits and "eg-
etabb to be Irradl3ted . 

Under these pohcles, the food 
and water we consume will be sub-
Jected to controversial trearments 
Without our consent because some-
one decided that It is better for us 
thiS way. 

Food Jrradianon is a popular 
Idea III the meat IIldustry and the 
federal government, which will 
save money by bUYIng cheaper, 
Irradiated meat to serve in school 
cafeterias beginlllng next year. 
Farmers a),o love the Idea because 
Irradiation kills any crop-threaten-
Ing foreign pests lurking in thl! 
mangos and planta lm. we import 
(rom other countries. 

Not everyone IS ~old on the 
practice, how c\'er. 

The ultimate goal behind Irra-
dlallon IS to sterilize food . 
Irradl3tJOn can loll bacteria and 
paraSltc, like E. coli or sal lllonella 
Illllleat, for IIHtance. It IS generally 
agreed upon that IrradiatiOn alter, 
food The proce s warms the food, 
may slightly change m tas te or 
"sl ighdy" reduce It; levels of the 
Vitalllill thiamine, accordlllg to the 
Ccnters for Disea e Control dlld 
Prcvenuon. The process also SlOpS 
natural rlpenlllg, extending shelf 
life. 

The problem IS that Irradl3uon , 
which uses gamma rays or elec-
trons, may Illtroduce clements that 

are harmful to humans. 
The Center for DIsease 

Control and Prevenuon de cribe 
Irradlanon as a Simple, harmless 
process, comparable to pasteuriza-
tion for milk or pressure-cooking 
for canned foods. The American 
Dietetic A:. oclation says Irradia-
tion research, testing a~d evalua-
non have been going on for 50 
years Without finding negative 
effects. The Center for Consumer 
Research POintS out that NASA 
astronauts dille on Irradiated beef, 
pork, smoked turkey and corned 
bee . 

Yet Public ClUten, a consumer 
advocacy group, de cnbes Irradia-
tion as "the equivalent of several 
billion chest X-rays." It says that 
irradiated produce contains 
"destroyed" V1tarrun , nutrients and 
chell1lcals Illlked to cancer and 
birth defects. The Organic 
Consumers Association, a nonprof-
It public intere t organization, con-
tends that Irradiation also breaks 
down cells and "sma hes" enzymes, 
maklllg digestion more difficult for 
the body. 

They also say that berween 5 
percent and 80 percent of VI ta mills 
A, C, E, K or B complex arc lost 
dUTlng Irradiation, dependll1g on 
the type of produce and Its e"po-
sure to radiation .

NATIONAL 
The nv York Tim IS reported 

on Jan. 29 that the irradiation 
industry wants to replace the wor-
risome term "food Irradiaoon" 
With "cold pasteurization" to 
downplay the proce s - and mis-
lead the consumer. Futhermore, 
the irradiation radula, or logo 
affixed to irradl3ted produce, looks 
a lot like logos that have nothing to 
do WIth Irradiation, a PR trick that 
further misleads the consumer. 

The bOllom lille is that meat 
IrradiatiOn and produce Irradiaoon 
a rc two different debate . Meat 
IrradiatiOn at least makes meat safer 
to comulllc by killing potentially 
deadly bacteria . The General 
Accounung ffice pOll1ts out that 
food pOlsol1lng In schoob II1creases 
by about 10 percent each year. 
Food-borne IIlne;scs cause 76 rrul -
lion II I ne;se" 325,000 ho\pltall73-
tlons and 5,000 deaths each year, 
lays the Center for Consumer 

Re~earch at C DaVIS. 
The only valid argument for 

permitting the Importauon of irra-
thated produ~c IntO the country for 
consumption that pertalm to con-
sumers IS that It offen, more vanety. 

But thats not a trong enough 
argument for Jlubhc Citizen, which 

By EMILY VIIIO, Senior Staff Wrltel 

has advised a moratorium on fur-
ther recommendations to expand 
food irrad iation. And it 's not a 
strong enough argument fo r 
Whole Foods, the health-con ciou 
supermarket that told the San 
Francisco Chrolllclr that it will not 
carry irradiated food . 

It may be true that irradiation is 
an option for meat, con idering the 
process could eradicate harmful or 
deadly bacteria. But as consumers, 
we should not be willing to buy and 
eat irradiated food becau e produc-
ers are afraid of foreign pests ruin-
mg their crops. 

Then there's the water. 
In 2006, 18 mill ion Southern 

Ca liforn ians can turn on their 
faucets and gel a blast of fl uoridat-
ed wa ter. Tbr all Dugo UIlIOIl-
Tnbzl1l1 reported Feb. 12 that the 
Metropolitan \Vater District, 
which provides water for over 90 
percent of San Diego County, has 
voted to !Iuoridate their water sup-
ply. 

Why? They're worried about 
our teetll . 

T he Sall Dugo UIlIOll - Trtbunl 
reported that one-third of 
Californ ia's water supply and rwo-
thi rds of the United States' water 
supply is fluoridated . Fluoride 
bonds with teeth, hardening their 
outside surfaces and perhaps pre-
venting decay. Advocates of flu -
oridation, t.kc the American 
Dental AsSOCiation, say that it 
can redu e dental dl ease by 
30 percent. 

Critics like tile Fluoride 
Action erwork say tI,at 
fluondatlon can Impede 
the growth of children's 
permanent tecth, call,e 
brown and white SPOl'., 
Impair bone, and thar 
the process only 
delays dental dlsea,e, 
It does not prevent 
It. They POll1 t out 
that the benefits of 

fluoride come from tOpical applica-
tion, not IIlge [Ion. 

T he FlUOride Action etwork 
says that 9 percent of Western 
Europe has elected not to !Iuondate 
its warer. It i n't that they doubt the 
potential benefits of fluoridation . 
They object to the procc,s because 
it is what Germany has called mas 
"compulsory lI1edICatlOn. " 

That IS JUSt what It IS. Southern

Election reform is unenforceable 
A.S. bylaws are fraught with loopholes 

By DANIEL WAn5 
Associate Opinion Editor 

When UCSD's student gov-
ernment spend three ho urs dis-
cussing the legal ra mifications of a 
1976 upreme Court case on cam-
paign fi nance refo rm , it 's more 
than a little odd. 

Fraught with good intentions, 
the A.S. Cou nci l amended its elec-
tions bylaws during the Feb. 26 
meeting. In the wake of a directive 
handed down by the UC presi-
dent, the A.S. Council abolished 
mandatory campaign spen ding 
re!otrictlOI1S, then instituted a vol -
untnry system of e,~pcnditllre lim-
Its. 

e.H, the council went a step 
further 111 "leveling the playing 
field" and forbade candidates to 
,Icccpt campaign contrlblltions 
from persons not affi liatcd With 
UCSD, wllh the exception of the 
candid.ltc's "ill1mecliate fa mily." 

These new provisions arc 
ndiculously unenforceable . 

Even the under the previou 
system, by which candidates were 
forced to re trlct their spending, 
srudellt politiCians found ways to 
evade the bylaws. In 1998, an 
IIldependent A.S. presidential can-
didate named Joe Leventhal chal-
lenged the bylaws' constitutionali-
ty alld failed . Rather than give up 
hope and limi't himself to the 
measly 200 allowed him by the 
draconian b}·J.IWS, Leventhal's 
fnends created the "Committee [Q 
Elect Joe Levcnth'll " to spend 
mOllcy Oil hl~ bchal f. 

F:vcry candidate thiS year will 
Opt IIltO the voluntary re~tnctlons 
wstem Jo not do ,0 would be to

CAMPUS 
to blly the e lection. I Iowever, 
every major slate -:- be it tudents 
First! or Unity or any others that 
should crop up - will undoubted-
Iy have some organi7.ation spend-
ing money on its behalf. The 
slates can spend as much as they 
want by funneling money through 
a friendly front group like the 
pingpong club. In real world poli-
tiCS, these unregulated orgalllza-
tions are called political action 
committees or ,pecial interest 
group. They're not runnlllg for 
office, so they're not restricted by 
e1cctions rule . 

The ban on outside contribu-
tion is laughable because of the 
impossibility of the elections man-
ager tracking down the origin of 
evcry dollar pent by every candi-
date. If a candidate pends a mil -
lion dollars on his campaign, 

there'~ no way to tell whether the 
ash came from his summer joh at 
t.ubucks or from J huge under-

the-table donation by Qualcomm. 
Contrary to the belief of omc 
AS Council members, there are 
no "dl clQsure rules" requiring 
candidates to reveal the ,ources of 
their Income. , 0 one will ever be 

brought before the elections COIII-
mlttee on charges of accepting 
contributions from olltside par-
ties. 

Besides the unenforcea ble 
ca mpaign finance regu lations, 
the A.S. elections bylaws are 
pac ked with other loopholes. 
T he mo t sign ificant is the defin-
ition of an official "campaign 
period." 

T he elections bylaws say that a 
timeframe known as the "cam-
paign period" doesn't begin until 8 
p.m. on the Sunday before spnng 
quarter c1asse . Most candldJtes 
have interpreted this to mean that 
one cannot begin hanging pmters 
or distributing glossy rave cards 
umil thiS time. 

Alas, nowhere in the elections 
bylaws does it say anything about 
candidates not belllg allowed to 
campaign until Sunday - and 
rightfu lly so, for to prevent candi-
dates from telling others of their 
potential candidacy is to unlawful-
ly restrict their freedom of pcech. 
Candidates could start hanging 
posters today, if they wanted. 
I ndeed, at thi POll1t, they are not 
e\'en candidates and are not undcr 
the JUrISdiction of the electiom 
committee. They could conduct a 
full-fledged campaign during the 
entire winter quarter, and since 
they havcn't signed any forms 
declaring themselves official can-
didates, they wouldn't bc subject 
to any of the election, bylaws. 
Until'the moment .1 stlldent turns 
III hiS "candidate packet" to the 
A.S. secretary, he I not a candi -
date. 

Run free while you can, little 
politicians. Run free l For the next 
two wceks, there are no rules .

'Daredevil' confuses 
the intelligent viewer 

Though ass and elbow are easily 
identified, movie's plot is not 

basically 
carrie Elizabeth Sklar 

I want to go on the record right now to set the record straight: In general, barring any inCidents 
involving the obviou alcohol or 
mass amounts of chocolate, I am a 
relatively intelligent human being. I 
may not be a rocket cientist, but I 
know my ass from my elbow. 

That ~ald, I alll now going off 
the record so that I can admit that 
I did not understand the plot of 
"Daredevil ." 

Now, I know what you're 
thll1kll1g. You ' re thinkll1g that 
" Daredevil " IS a movie based on a 
comic book . And you're probably 
mak.lIlg the mental leap to the real-
1z,'1tJon that the baSIC stol'),llIle of 
thiS movie is deSigned for even the 
most Idiotic of 7 -year-olds to 
understand . So by now yo u've 
corne to the co nclusion that I fall 
just short of an Idiotic 7 -year-old 
on the Intelligence cale. 

Well fine, you happen to be cor-
rect about all of those POllltS. But 
unlike all of the rupid people I 
know, I have an explanaoon to 
explalll my mental honcomlllgs. 

First of all, I really uldn 't want 
to see "Daredc\~1. ,. I wanted to ee 
"About chlmdt" or "AdaptJtlOn" 
- omething smart people see. I 

would have waltcd to see 
"Daredevil" so that I could deny 
seeing it by talklllg Instead about 
one of those other films. But I was 
with a man of homosexual onenta-
tion, and Ben Affleck does wear 
skin-tight lea ther throughout most 
of the film . Enough said. 

So there I was, ready to enjoy this 
mindless acuon film . And I must say, 
it was rather good. It hJd basic char-
acter development, speCia l effects, 
romantic Intere~t and -lest we for-
get - Ben Affleck 111 skill-tight 
leather. All in all, It was J good time. 

This was what I was thlnkmg 
when the film reached what I like to 
call "the key moment of the film 
when everythll1g finally tlt:s together 
and the enu of the film becomes 
completely ob\;ous." I call It tillS 
because at this moment m the tihn 
(follow me c10selv here, tillS I, .1 reJI-
Iy complicated ' term), \:\·crythlllg 
finally nes together, Jnd the end 
becomes completely Ob'"OlI'_ Sull

b OPINI N 

Basically: Muted audio 
seemed like part of the film 

conrmued from page 5 
commercial for this movie) that the 
premise of "Daredevil" is that the 
hero IS blind, but all of his other 
en es have been heightened by 

radiation . Because that happens all 
the time. Right. Anyway, through-
out the mm, there are occasional 
scencs that give the audience an 
Idea of what it might be like to see 
the world through audio wavcs, so 
that we can better con nect with the 
experiences of a blind superhero (as 
if we all haven't felt like thot 
before). 

o my fir t instinct when the 
fight continued \\~thout ound wa 
to assume that Colin Ferrell, usmg 
hiS undeniable ex appeal, wa 
slowly damaging Daredevd' other 
senses, tarting With his heanng, 
and what we were expenenclng was 
what a fight would be hke if you 
were blind and deaf. 

J thought that for five minutes. 
Of course, the rest of the the-

ater caught on to the fact that the 
mOVIe itself wa just fucked up 
about four minures before I did. I 
know thiS because they started 
yellmg thlllgs like, "Put the sound 
back on!" at the SCreen. 

Anyway, the fight continued 
without ound. 1 finally caught on 
to the fact that this was a technical 
problem, and none of it really 
bothered me that much. How 
Important IS the actual sound of Ben 
Affleck getting hiS ass kicked' Ot 
very. 

Bur then Colin Ferrell started 
talking. And Ben Affleck did a little 
bit of talking back, but that really 
wasn't as Important because he IS 
not Cohn Ferrell And then J real -
Ized that thIS was the moment I The 
moment when the bad gu)' IS sure 
he has won, so he give~ away every 

plot secret and explains every loop-
hole! And 1 was missmg it! 

Then, like a voice from thc 
heavens, comes: "I have anotller 
super power, Daredevil. One you 
have never seen before." 

Cur to Ben Affleck, who i 
understandably scared by thiS new . 

Then back to Colin Ferrell : " I 
butt-rape my victims." 

What)! 
The screen shows our !iero 

again. Hes struggling to get up (and 
I must admit that, Colin Ferrell or 
no, I would be trying to run away, 
too) . "No, not butt-rapel" 

Thl is definitely not a voice 
&om the heaven . By now, those of 
you who are more intelligent than I 
am will have realized that tile actu-
al sound never came back on, but 
the audience, bemg the re ourceful 
bunch that they were, deCided to 
add their own soundtrack. 

"Yes, I will butt-rape you, just 
like J butt-raped ... Oong dramatic 
pause) . .. your Jathrr l " 

f course, the whole audience 
was shocked by this plot twist. But 
before we could react, the official 
movie ound came back on ju t in 
time for me to hear Ben Affleck ay, 
" ... my father?" 

And then, of course, he wa sud-
denly revived and won the fight, 
complete Wlth ound. 

o basically, I still don't know 
what the bad guy had to do with 
DaredCYll's failier. I 'd probably say it 
had something to do with butt-rape. 
Bur before you label me a moron, 
allow me to please point Out that this 
IS my ass, this I my elbow ....

THE UCSD GUARDIAN MONDAY, "'1ARCH 3, 2003 

LE II ER TO THE EDITOR 
Killing dogs is useless 

and unethical 
Editor: 

I agree with Hsieh in the arti-
cle on the dog labs (Feb. 24 issue 
of the Guardia'!) that "animal 
abuse in this nation and around 
the world is no doubt a problem 
that should be focu ed on," but 
would like to use a morc inclusive 
meaning of the word "abuse." I 
would like to comment on what 
she defines as "humane," because 
these labs do violate the animals' 
welfare. The e animals are bred 
simply to be killed and arc not 
small, but are confined to small 
cages. They arc put to death by 
tho e that are up posed to be tak-
ing care of them. lIundreds have 
been killed at UC D alone. 

Put ilie u efulness you may 
believe is there aside, and think 
about the moral questions 
involved. Would you allow this to 
happen to your dog? If not, we 
ought to be equally opposed to 
these actions when committed 
against an animal without a name 
or a home. It's suppo edly humane 
because the animals are injected 
with potassium chloride and feel 
no pain . Judging &om the debate 
that exists surrounding the moral -
ity of capital punishment, it can 
hardly be agreed upon a ethical. 
Compounding that, leilial IIlJec-
tions are reserved for our worst 
cri minals, not our best friends .. 

Hsieh says the Web site 
http://www.doctorsagainrtlabs.com 
undermines the argument by 
presenting a different breed of 
dog than is used and by being 
overly biased . It is true that peo-
ple who have witnessed dozens 
of dogs being killed unnecessari-
ly may have feelings about it, 
which is understandable . 
Humans are biased and have 
feelings when others are victims 
of injustice. They are dogs, sen-

" Lethal injections are 
reserved for our worst 
criminals, not our best 

jrienill. " 
tient animals, and not a set of 
data that can be spoken of with-
out compas ion. 

H ieh suggests that dog labs 
are beneficial because they pre-
pare students for unpleasanmes , 
but by killing animals, our future 
doctors are taught to be merciless 
and unsympathetic. We ought to 
teach them to care deeply for the 
life in their power and not simply 
hrug when their patient die . 

One claim is that medi cal 
schools iliat have abolished dog 
labs have done so because of pres-

That the United Kingdom was so 
pressured that it abolished the 
practice entirely? Or is it more 
reasonable that these progressive 
schools have simply progressed) 

We are told that their death is 
a small price for student experi-
ence. These labs arc performed 
not for re earch, but to establish 
known facts again and again. It's 
possible to learn &om a video or 
computer simulator, from a 
human cadaver, or by observing 
human surgery like many schools 
do. That teaches SUI dents what 
medicine is , rather than opening 
up a sl11all, furry animal. The 
alternative isn't si mpl y reading the 
book instead or spend ing hours 
studying. What 's ca lled for arc 
replacements for the labs, not the 
ability to opt out. 

Hsieh says that it's acceptable 
to kill when there is a purpose. Of 
cour e anyone who kill any ani-
mal is going to claim there was a 
valid purpose. Would it be accept-
able to kill my pet if I had a very 
good reason, such as watching itS 
heart slow down and speed up, 
and say, "yeah, that's what they 
said would happen" ?

Instant runoff suggested 
Task force to recommend new voting system 

By GAELLE FAURE 
Associate News Editor 

The ASUC D Ad Iloe Voting 
Svstelll~ Task Force decidetl to rcc-
ornmentl the aciopuon of i mtant 
runoff voting to the A.S. ouncil at 

II~ meeting on Feb. 2!!. The task 
force, after tallymg the results of ,I 
mock election that polled studel1tl 
un Library \V.llk on Feb. 2 1 ancl 
Feh. 2M, debated the merits of four 
voting systems: instant runoff, 
Condorcet, approval and plurality, 
the lauer of which IS currently In 
place. The task force will pre~ent 
ItS recommendation during the 
A. . Council's March 5 meeting. 

"I hope A .. will implement the 
recomltlendations," said F.leanor 
Roosel'elt College Freshman 
Senator Max Harrington, who 
spearheaded the idea of a ta k force 
and served al its chair. "I believe it 
will. Just practically, we have six 
scnators on this task force, and il 
was a unanimous decision, so I 
think they're going to seriously 
look at IRV and see that its better 
than plurality." 

In instant runoff voting, voter 
rank their choice in order of pref-
erence, and if any candidate 
receivcs over 50 percent of the first 
choice votes, they arc elected, as 
they would be under plunllity vot-
ing as well. Ilowever, If they do not 
receive this maJonty, the last- place 

candidate is elimina ted, and each 
ballot cast for that candidate counts 
for the second choice listed on that 
ballot. This procc s of elimination 
and recounting is repeated until 
one candidate receives over SO per-
cent. According to the enter for 
Voting and Democracy, this eliml-
narcs "spoilers," cnablll1g votcr~ to 
vote mOre freely for t1md-pany 
candidates in a bipartisan race 
wlthoUL fear of hclplllg their Icast 
faVOrite candidate. According to 
the CVD, tillS sy~tem generally 
increases voter Uirnout mel pro-
motes more pOSitive campaigning. 

According to I larrington, how-
ever, there is criticism of instant 
runoff, particularly regardll1g Its 
suppOrt by some major politicians. 

" I think some people may say 
tllat this actually demonstrates how 
weak of a reform it is, because if the 
major parties don't feci ilireatened 
enough by it and suppOrt it, then 
what willlRV do? Will it pe rpetu -
ate our two-party system?" 
I Yarrington said. 

Ilowever, he said he felt that 
this system still give third parties a 
greater opportunity to grow and 
challenge major parties. 

Several members of the task 
force felt that the instant runoff 
~ystem, if implemellled, has the 
potential to change the outcome of 
A.S. elections. Elections in the past 
have produced offiCials who had 

received less than the majority of 
the vote; in last year's race, for 
example, Jenn Brown was elected 
receivmg less than 50 percent of 
votes cast. 

After learning ahout Instant 
runoff vOllng from the Green 
Pany's advocacy of thl'> system, 
Ilarrington had first proposed to 
form an instant runoff ta,k force. 
Ilowel'e r, the A.S. CounCIl's Jan . !) 
approval of a task force asketl that 
rhe members look at a vanety of 
sy~tcms . The task force included an 
A.S. senator from each college. 
After sta rting out 1~llh IlIne vonng 

~ystems under conslderauon, they 
narrowed the number down to 
four, discounting others due to 
their unsuitability of apphcatJon to 
the UCSD campus. 

The mock elections polled over 
100 suldents on Library Walk on 
their preference between five differ-
ent academic departments in a sce-
nario where one department was to 
be elected to set academic require-
ments for all tudents. Political sci-
ence won by every voting system; 
the result, however, was not of any 
consideration to the task force. The 
polling was intended to familiarize 
students with the four systems by 
having them vote in the four differ-
ent ways, with task force members 
answering any questions they had as

focused on the furure of growth 
and resource allocation at UCSD. 
Chandler laid out a very descri ptive 
plan for growth in three main 
areas: the facul ty, the untlergradu-
ate programs and the 
~rraduatclprofessional school pro-
gram,. 

"This i a vcry competitive situ-
ation we arc m," Chandler said 
regarding faculty growth. 

UCSD continuously recruitS 
faculty from top in;tltUllOns 
around the country, Chandler said, 
Inciudlllg Ilarvard, Mas achusem

" \\'c are at our highest rate of 
recruitment right now, and we 

mu~t continue thiS until 1010," 
Chantller said . 

I n addition to the expansion of 
undergraduate prograllls, which 

handler praised as J re~ult of 
continued faculty growth, the 
graduate and profes,ional pro-
grams have abo been expa nded, 

With new research in areas such a 
biOI n formancs , en VI ronmen tal 
studies, computational sciences, 
political cience and international 
affairs. 

"Graduate growth is fundamen-
tally important," Chandler said. 
"Our graduate programs erve our

a model institution of the

60 affiliated faculty members, as 
well as numerous upporting pro-

gram is expected to be presented in 
an International symposium later

The final topic presented dealt 
WIth issues of homeland security. 

"Re earch in homeland security 
i not a new mission at UCSD, and 
started well before cpt. II, 200 I," 
Dynes said when he opened the 
presentation. 

San Diego has been thought of 
a a prime target of terrorism 
because It CO tHa1l1 a large port, 
one of the nanon' bUSIest border 
cross1l1gs and several ml1llary 
bases. 

" cpt. II closed the door on 
tradmonal research and develop-

IS on research. development and 
deployment."

E-Check: Bill payment goes online 
cuntinued frum /Jagc I 

"Campuses such as UCLA use all online 
credit ca rd payment option," Cooper said. 
"But they have to charge students an addi-
tional $10 a year in fees to pay the vendor 
that supplies the service. And with the cur-
rent budget problems and hikes in tuition, 
such a fee increase was not a popular 
option." 

1 f enough student~ use the new system, 
there is a good chance that the fee amount 
will go down. The current goal is 30 percent 
panict pa tion by registered students 111 the 
next four years. 

The new ser.~ce wi ll also aid in the cur-
rent ca mpus budget crisis. As it stands now, 
the universIty spends roughly $100,000 a 
year Oil mailing billing statements to Stu-

dents. The long-term goal, according to 
Cooper, is for students to be able to enroll 
for classes and pay their tuition fees all in one 
si tting. This would cilininate the spend1l1g 
necessary for in-between tasks, such as the 
packag1l1g and distribution of the sta tements. 

E-Check can al 0 help lessen the problem 
of late fees that arise from mail delays by 
allowing snldents to pay and update their 
balances Immediately. 

H\ Ve have high hopes for the new ser-
vice," Cooper said. "We want all students, 
new and conttnuous, to be aware of E-Check 
and utilize It." 

For more information on E-Check and 
future payment options, contact the billing

nil)' to acquire valuable work

their academic and career mter-
esrs. \\ 1m make AI P different 
from orher internship programs IS 
that It allows srudenrs to wurk 
while contributmg to their acade-
miC progress. 

'';\1 P pronde tudents the 
oppornlnll)' to get credit for doing 
an academiC II1ternship. ThiS has 
the ohnom benefit ofhelpmg sru-
dents carn unlls toward gradua-

Ta\'l or. "AI 0 , mall\' tudents are 
noi a\\ are that to do Inrern hips In 
some orgamzatJons or industries 
such as radiO, tele\~ Ion and bro-
kerage firms, they are required to 
receive college credl t." 

Upon hearing the word intern-
shIp, many would a OClate it With 
busy work that IS nor challenging. 

"I thmk a lot of Internships arc 
JUSt companies trying to get credll 
for helping young people get 
expenence, but Instead of real 
expenence, they make you do 
office work bke faXIng and sta-
pbng," aid Revelle College fresh-
man tephanie Tsukamoto. 

However, to list an internship, 
a company must make sure that 
the responsibilities of the student 

Intern be hnked to academiC smd-
les, that srudeJ1[s are not permit-
ted to participJte in telemarketing 
or cold-calhng of any kind, and 
that general office duties must be 
kept to a mmlmUI11. 

There are vanous ways SUl-
denr~ can lind Informanol; linked 
With ,\lP. 

"1\ rudent can lind an Intern-
ship on their own using Career

requirements, a coun elor Will 
help the student enroll for credit," 
Taylor . ald. 

After seemg a coun c1or, one 
needs to find a faculty advisor who 
has expertise releva n t to the 
Internship, and preferably one 
from whom he has taken at least 
one upper-divisIOn course to 
SUpervl e tus work. 

AlP also caters to the needs of 
students on a more personal level to 
make sure that the prospective

interns find Internships that suit 
their desires. 

"We also work lI'ith snidents 
one-on-one to place them in an 
inrernship related to their inter-
csts and career goals," Taylor said. 

Internships arc available year-
round, but summer seems to be a 
very popular quarter to Intern. 

Iloping to secure a summer 
Internship, Revelle ollege junior 
Da\1d Brena said, "I am applying 
for an internship this summer 
because r want to do something 
productive and want to gain expe-
rience." 

Another reason smdenrs seek 
internships arc for the travel 
opporUiniti.:s. "AIP's \\'ashington, 
D .C. and London programs pro-
\'Ide students with exciring oppor-
runHie to Intern in the nation's 
capitol or abroad," laylor said . 

This concept is definitely 
encouragll1g snldents to apply for 
Internship , Brena said, "I am also 
applying because I am hoping to 
travel , and r want to go to 
London," 

There are also the "Out of 
town" intern hi ps, where srudents 
can work for companies all across 
the nation. In the past, srudents 
have gone to work with "The Late 

how with David Letterman" in 
ew Vork, fBM in Texas, the 

Getty Museum in Los Angele 
and the state capital in 

acramento, Calif. It is al 0 possi-
ble for students to arrange an 
intern hip in their hometown.

internships are a definite plus on a

OK to he lost in thought for a 
while. Vour friends will cover for

Tauru ( pril 20-May 20) You 
can get a lot done with the right 
ream. Focus on the objective so 
that you can keep others on track. 
And keep control of the money. 
You're the most practical one. 

Gemini (May 21-June 21) Life's 
more exciting when you're taking a 
risk. Vou won't get cverything right 
away, but make your intentions 
known. Vou could attract a collabo-
rator. 

Cancer aune 21-)uly 22) You'd 
probably like to stay gone for 
another day or twO, but other work 
demands your attention. Don't quit 
until you've got next }'ear's income 
set aside. 

Leo Ouly 23-Aug. 22) You hate 
financial hassles. They houldn't 
apply to you. Vou should be able to 
get whatever you want And maybe 
you will, evenrually, but you won't 
get it all today. 

VlJ'go (Aug. 23-Sept. 22) Vour 
parmer nearly has everything under

worth the cost. 

Sagittarius ( ov. 22-Dec. 21) 
Vou're bei ng pressured to tell the

Men's volleyball gives Bruins 
tough run in match at RIMAe 
Tritons change setter again after loss to 
LBSU, but still suffer familiar setback 

By BRYCE WARWICK 
Senior Staff Writer 

It's deja vu all over again fo r the 
VCSD men's volleyball team. After 
a rough loss to Long Beach Srate, 
the Tritons made yet another 
switch at setter, but still suffered a 
si m i lar l oss three nigh ts l ater 
against VCLA. 

VCSD hcad coach Ron Larsen 
crotted Out the same l i neup on Feb. 
26 thar he'd used in prior matches, 
with senior Tye 111Oreson doing the 
setting. Just like they have made a 
habit of doing, the Tritons hung 
close for the first game. Despite the 
4gers' quick 8-4 start, UCSD 
showcd thar It was willing to battle 
and tied the game at 10. either 
team was dble to separate, and arrer 
the Tritons fought off a game POlOt, 
the <;core leveled at 29 apiece. LBS 
was able to earn a SIde out, however, 
and a ' fhmn attack error gave the 
4ger the game. 

ShowlIlg morc resolve than It 
has dl)played irt previous malches, 
UCSD hung tough after the loss in 
the first game and stayed competi-
tive in the second. In the end, the 
4gers held on for a narrow 30-27 
viuory. 

The more athletic LflS wore 
down the Tnron~ in the thIrd game 
and crutsed ro the 30- 19 sweep. 

Thoreson pIcked up 33 aSSISts 
and Eric Perrine Icd UC D with 
II kills, while dam Toren added 
nine and a team- high SIX dig~ . 

Failing to capita l ize on the 
opporrunity they had in the first 
game is som ething the Tritons 
were definirely concerned with, but 
they inSisted th,1t their lack of suc-
ce~s In those situations III the paSt 
wa not a factor. 

"It wasn't a lack of confidence, 
it's iuSt that we needed to push on 
th,1t and we didn't," ' l oren \ald. 
" [ r's a rough loss." 

U SD returned to action 
1\larch I In ,mother ,\ l ountaln 
Pacdic SpOrt Feder.ltlon match 
WIth UCLA. Po\sibly respondmg 
to the re'oul b of J tealll survey he 

conduc ted ove r the w eekend , 
Larsen played Per rine at setter in 
hopes of gettirt g a better r esul t. 

The fi rst game was a shootout, 
with both teams combining for 55 
ki lls on only J3 errors and treating 
the fans at RlMAC Arena to a classic 
duel. The Tritons hit nearly .200 
points above their attacking percent-
age on the eason, hitting .408, while 
the Bruins countered with a .478 
mark of their own. UCLA had the 
first chance ro put the game away at 
29-28, but the Tritons were able to 
get a Ide out and level the score. 
The lritons had the next game point 
at 30-29, but the Bruins were also 
3 ble to get a srop. After four unsuc-
cessful attempts to clo e the match 
by UCLA and three by UCSD, 
Bruin outside hitter Jonathan costa 
cam e tip wilh back- to-back solo 
blocks on Jim Wdller to steal the 
game for U LA at 37-35 . 

Waller had II of his m atch-hIgh 
I R kIll s in the firsl game, and Andy 
Rupp tallied seven 111 the first frame 
en rotlte ro a season- high /J . 

The fir~t gam e was to be the 
high POtl1l for the Trnons, howev-
er, ~tnce UC 'D managed only 25 
lulls in the last tWI) combined, com-
pared to 27 in the /im game alone. 

UCLA used a balan('ed offcn~e 
that saw three plnycr~ wllh double-
dtglt kill figures to fill I h the 
Tritons 30-23 and 30-26 in the 
final two games. 

Pernne dished our 49 a si ts tn 
his return to the etter slO[, Ke'~n 
Keyser picked up SIX block assists 
and Waller led the team with 10

D espite the los, the team sti ll

direction, especially with Perrine

Softball: Mettee hits her second home run 
COlHtnued from page 20 

four runs. The first was scored by 
fre,hman Danielle Ro 5, who was 
pinch-running for sophomore 
Jamie Hurst, who walked. The 
. econd wa,> cored by Jllnior Amy 
Mettee, who also walked. 

opholl1ore J\heko McCue then 
hit a two-run double, scoring 
freshmen Nikt Anderson and 
Jennifer Leonard. ue D gained 
an insurance run in the sixth to 
put the score at 5-2. 

The Will went to freshman 
starter Stephame Kurz, who 
brought her record up to 2-1 with 
six inntngs of two-run ball. Junior 
Jodie Bland picker! up the save in 
an tnnrng of work, her second of 
the season. 

"I got tnto a couple of Jalll in 
the fifth and sixth Innings, but the 
team provided moral and defen-
~Ive suppOrt, and we got out of it 
without any runs scored," Kurz 
saId. 

The second game against 
Chico got out 10 a much tougher 
start for UCSD, since the 
Wildcat qUIckly scored three 
runs off tarter Bland in the first 
inning. Chico added twO more tn 
the fifth and one more in the 
IXth before Bland, a Junior, was 

pulled for sophomore Ken 
Ilanley, who finished off the 
game pitching one and two-thIrds 
tnl1lngs. Bland's loss put her at 5-
2 on the season. 

VeSD was shut Out for the 
first five inntngs, but Mettee 
started off the sixth inning in 
style with her second home run 
of the rear. The Tritons capital-
ized on three-straight walks and 
multiple balks by Chico reliever 
Emily M Dermont to core two 
more runs, but were shutdown 
once Chico's starter, Amber 
Neves, returned . UCSD put up 
one last fight in the seventh when 

Sara~ M. Stauc~/Cuo,dian 
Tum two: The Tntons try to execute a double play against UC DaVIS, but the 
Aggles' Megan Turman makes It difficult by sliding hard into second base. 

Ilurst singled and advanced to 
second on an error, and junior 
Kim Aggabao knocked her tn 
with a double, but one run was all 
the Tritons could get, eventually 
losing 6-4. 

"\ e came Ollt ready to play, 
and it was nice to get the first win, 
but our fundamentals broke down 
in the second game, and we gave It 
to them," said Triton head coach 
Patti Gerckens. 

The doubleheader against UC 
DaVIS on March I started on a 
sour note with an 8-2 loss. The 
Aggies quickly jumped to a 7-0 
lead off starter Bland, who wa 
pulled after 2.1 innings of work 
and suffered the 10 s that put her 
record at 5-3 on the season. Both 
Triton runs were scored by fresh-
man Desiree Franclscus, while 
Aggabao added an RBI. 

Game two of the Davis double -
header was a nail biter, with starter 
Hanley throwing a five-hit com-

plete gatne, but dropping her 
record to 3-5 with the setback. 
The only difference in the game 
came on one wing by Sue Yale of 
Davis, who hit a home run In the 
fifth inning. 

Mettee collected two of 
UCSD's hits, while Leonard and 
senIor KttSttll H unstad got the 
other two. The Trttons left SIX 
runners on base. 

"The second game agaInst 
Davis was one of the best games 
we've played In a long time," 
Gerckens saId. "It was one of 
those games where someone Just 
has to lose. If we can lose to Davis 
by one rUIl, though, we can heat 
anyone." 

VCSD is now 10-9 on the sea-
son and 6-6 in the alifornia 
Collegiate Athletic Association. 
The Tritons will face C U 
Bakersfield on March 7 and CSU 
Dominguez Hills on March 
both away game.

Behind a huge performance 
from Kim Aim, ChJCO cored tn

I run on a different schedule than mo~t people. My clas es stan at II a m. 0 I don't gct 
up until at least 10, and bedome IS

realm! thIS Isn't typIcal behavIOr, 
but Jill I the only one who thlllks

For fJr toO many IlIght~ , I\·c 
heard the famlltar ound of the 
announcement~ over the loud-
speakers that the buildlllg IS about 
to clo~e, and far tOO many times, It 
has closed before I'm ready to 
leave. I'm not the only one. A lOt 
of people get herded to the exItS 
nght along with me, or cut theIr 
workout~ short because they know 
the clo e I comlllg. And \V'hy; 1'0 
save some money III operating 
co ts: 

I don 't know about vou, but of 
all the thlllgs I pay for at thl~ 
school, RL\1AC I probably the one 
I find most useful. It' a great facllt -
ty; there are a lot of recreaoon 
options and, at least for now, there' 
always parklllg nearby. I'd be more 
than wllllllg to pay a few extra dol-
lars a quarter to keep RL\.1AC open 
longer. Twenty-four hours would 
be ntce, but I'd serue for the build-
Illg ~ta}~ng open until 2 a.m. 

Isn 't thIS the time in our Itvcs 
when our sleep schedules are the 
most outrageous? Don't we need 
omething to do at one III the 

morlllng when we just can't study 
any more? houldn't there be 
somethlllg to do on thIS ndicu-
lously dead campus at ntght~ 

I reahze that you have a poten-
oal safety concern if you have peo-
ple comlllg OntO campus or walklllg 
across campus late at rught. That 
belllg sa Id, there are systems 
already In place to gwe you a afe 
walk wherever you'd hke to go, and 
LaJolla IS so laughably low In mme 
that the rISk is truly minimal. 

I get tired of the talk about 
Improvlllg Itfe at UCSD, the 
admllllStration's doublespeak and 
seeing how we're mOVIng toward 
AS. e1ecuons, you're about to hear 
much more of the same. '#hen I~

Men's basketball ends losing ways 
Late jumper gives Tritons victory over Davis 

By AMBER MAmN 
Staff Writer 

The Tritons came back from 
the weekend up north I- I after 
two close games. While 
WintcrFest was talang place in 
RIMAC Arena on Feb. 28, the 
UCSD men 's basketball team 
was able to overcome UC Davis 
in its home gym with a jump shot 
in the last SIX seconds to win 85-
84. Then, after five lead changes 
throughout the game, the 
Tntons fell seven points short of 
beating ChICO tate, finishing 
89-82 on March I . 

On Feb. 28, the Aggie took 
over the first half, entering the 
locker room with a 14-poi nt 
lead. At 52-38, the scoreboard 

did not stop the Tritons, who 
came out ready to play. With 
7:38 left in the game, UCSD 
went on a run tha t lasted 4:22 
and olltscored Davis 16-3 . Davi 
took the lead, but Adam Snyder, 
who had six points in the last 
I :42, answered every Davis score. 

The Tritons were up with 26 
seconds to go until Davis' 
Dominic allori made two free 
throw to regain the lead for the 
Aggies. Then it came down to 
the last seven second , when the 
Tritons called a timeout after 
almost throwing the ball away. 
Following the timeollt, Snyder 
caught the inbound pas , drove 
into the key and made a jumper 
with just three seconds left in the 
game. 

"I didn't have a good angle, so 
had to shoot an off-balance 

shot, and luckily it went in," 
Snyder said. 

This win snapped a 13 -game 
losing streak to the Aggies, who 
dropped their six th-straight 
game, and brought the Tritons to 
5- 14 in the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association.
