Graduate 'Student an 
Apparent Suicide at Muir 

The body of graduate student Brad Gre-.l', an apparent liuicide 
victim, was discovered by a jogger early Thanksgiving morning 
on Muir' a soccer field. 

A vial containing a "strong. smelling" chemical substance was 
found near Grey by cam~s police after they received a call from 
the jogger about 7 am Thursday, according to Campus Police 
Chief Hugh French. 

Grey, 27, was last seen by his wife sometime Wednesday and 
probably died late that evening, French says. 

Grey was reportedly depressed after missing his Master's orals 
Wednesday, according to French. 

But Nathan Kaplan, thesis advisor for Grey, says the death was 
the result of a "combination of factors, " and says the exam (in 
chemistry) "wag a cause, but it was much deeper than that." 

Although Grey's death was an apparent suicide, the county 
coroner has ruled its cause "unknown" until a 30 to 40.day 
investigation is completed, French says. 

The contents of the vial will not be known for several more days 
pending laboratory te!>ts, according to French. 

AluDlni Association Endorses 
SaltDlan for Chancellor's Post 

By Jeff Beresford·Howe 
and Meg Honda 

The Alumni Association aid ye terday tha t 
it wants Vice Cha ncellor of Academic Affairs 
Pau l a llman to be UCSD's n xt cha ncellor . 

In a leiter to UC Pre!>ident David axon, 
chairman of the committee looking for a 
successor to William McElroy, th asso ia tion 
said, "We believe that Dr. Pa ul Saltman, 
throughout his service to U 0 , has 
de mon s tr a ted ca pa bilit ies th a t are in 
accorda nce with (our ) criteria. Dr. a llman 
would make a n outstanding chancellor. We, 
therefore, sugg st that Dr. a llman b giv n 
strong considera tion for th position of 
Cha ncellor of UC . an Diego." 

The decision to endorse Saltma n was made 
by a n Association executive committe Nov . 
IS, a nd no other candida tes were on!>idered , 
according to Alumni President Ra ndy 
Schwartz. 

a ltman, a lmost unanimously agreed upon 
as the top UCSD contender for the post 
McElroy will leave in June, was delighted with 
the endor!>ement. 

" I'm please tha t a lumni would write this ... it 
represents what I hope people will fe a~out me. 

The endor!>ement establishes three criteria 
for the post Schwartz !>aid the a lumni 
committee almost unanimously recognized. 

First, the letter says, "any serious candidate 
for the position of chancellor should have a 
dedication to the role of teaching as a vital 
function of the university." 

Also of primary importance, it continues, are 
a commilmerlt Jo "academic excellence" and a 
"successful history of leadership experience 
and administrative expertise ... " and an 
awareness of "the unique relationship that 
exists between faculty and administration in the 
University of California system." 

The chancellor's search committee meets 
today to narrow the list of candidates for 
Mc Elroy' 5 spot to "about 12·15." Saltman is 
virtually certain to be on that smaller ~st. 
committee members say. 

The Alumni Association Board of Directors 
met early this month, decided to respond to a 
search committee request for their evaluation of 
what a chancellor !>hould do. 

Nov. II, the Board committee met and 
decided to interview Saltman that Thursday, 
Schwartz says. 

After the meeting with the vi e chancellor, it 
was a "consensus" decision to endorse 5altman 
"pretty much in the strongest terms." 

Schwartz !>ays "Saltman is the only 
contender that has been publicly acknowledged 
by the search committee. and we feel the 

commillee will end up choo!>ing between 
a llman and a n outsider. " 

Frank Phillipl> ,' the alumni representative to 
the cha ncellor's l>earch ommitlee , asked not to 
be consulled on the deci!>ion because, he says, 
he didn' t want to compromise his position. 

Kennedy Will Talk 
To Small Group 
At Med School 

By Monica Gieben 
Staff Writer 

na tor Edward Kennedy will address a 
l>mall gath ring of 50·55 people at Winzer 
Commonl> on the medical !>chool campus this 
Friday, campus health care officials say. 

Originally scheduled to !>peak in Mandeville 
Center or the gym, Kennedy will now meet only 
with reprel>entatives ot various campus health 
care organizations a well as a few faculty 
member!>. 

Why his plans were changed could not be 
explained by the senator's Washington staff or 
San Diego advance staff. 

Kennedy will speak on "health care delivery, 
in general, " according to Mike McCraw, 
Health Science Advisory Program and Career 
Planning acting director. 

The selected studenlli and faculty 
participating in the discussion will be allowed to 
pose questionlo and to express concerna 
pertaining to the health care iuue. 

A procedure to decide which atudenb will 
attend Kennedy's discussion has been 
established by the Health Experience Learning 
Program and H5AP. 

"We've contacted the various health related 
student organizations 'on campus, of which 
there are about nine, and each organization halt 
recommended to us those members who have 
been most involved in the organization and in 
health related activities that would indicate that 
they had a sincere concern for the state of 
health care delivery ," explains McCraw.

Chinese Lit. Scene Flowering, Novelist Says 
By Eric Jaye 

The dark age of chine!>e literature under the evil 
reign of the gang of four ha !> ended, a visiting novelist 
from the People'!> Republic said here last night. 

All over China writers who were stifled by the gang 
of four are being rehabilitated and a bumper crop of 
anxiou young writers is emerging, Regent!> Lecturer 
Xiao Qian told an International Center audience. 

Under the lo(ang, Xiao said, "Art served as a 
means to their viciou!> needs. Artists were stifled and 
sometimes even murdered." 

Today, the same wind of liberalization' that is 
aiweeping the rest of Chinese society is putting 
Chinese literature "back on the right path." Xiao 
said. 

Mode of thinking can't be chanlo(ed overnight, 
Xiao warned, but he declared himself an "optimi!>t ," 

The rich Chinese literary tradition ha. "paid 
dearly" for the eXCe5loeS of the !(anl{ of four, Xi<to

2 The Daily GuardIan TuHday, Nov. ff1, 1t79 

At Least It's a Chance To Be Heard Signatures For Classes 
Hard to Get Editor: I was pleased to see that the 

Chancellor Search Committee 
is requesting .tudent input via 
a questionnaire in your 
newlpaper. As if that weren't 
enough, the committee, which 
advisel the real search 
committee is wholly composed 
of .tudents. 

A moment's thought was 
enoullh to vaporize any 
feelinga oIsati.faction at being 
able to take part in the 
selection of our next 
chancellor. Clearly, the 
chancellor has a 800d deal of 
power al UCSO'II chief 
adminiatrator. It i. he (or, iii i. 
too earthshakins to IUllgelt, 
abe?) who aets the ,1eneral 
c5recti0n 01 development at 
UCSO; mo.t prosrarns of 
importance operate under IU 
direct or indirect supervision. 

Unfortunately, a cun;ory 
exmnination 01 the campoai. 
tion of the search committee 
and of the questiona on the 
lW'Vey ill rather diaheartenins. 

'The aearch committee it 
compoaed aJmoet entirely of, 
aurpriae aurprise, members of 
the A.oc:iated Students. Do 
they represent our interests? 
Reportedy, there was about a 
15 percent turnout (juat over 
one·seventh) 01 IIludents for 
the last AS e1ectionll. In 
national politics, garnerins 60 
percent of the vots for a given 
office is conaidered a landslide 
victory, 10, for the sake of 
simplicity, lets use this as an 
averase for the fraction of 
vote, won by the AS 
government members as !1 
whole, though it is a bit on the 
generous side (many won with 
Ie .. than 50 percent, and few 
with. even 60 percent). Sixty 
percent of 15 percent IS 
exactly nine percent, so it 
appears that the AS represents 
approximately nine percent, 
jUit under one·tenth, of the 

Erratum 
In yesterday's 

Daily Guardian, we 
identified a speaker at 
the Iranian rally as a 
San Diqo State Iranian 
Iludent. 

In fad, the speaker 
was Stephanie Camp-
W. a rally organizer 
... UCSD Iludent. 

We apologize for the 
en"Or. 

~""1111_"'_ ~_lA '''''''''''''''' 
.tudent body. How they can 
pretend to represent our 
interests i. not immediately 
obvious. 

Question 1 01 the .urvey 
uk. the student to "prioritize" 
a ~st of qualities to be sought 
alter in a new chancellor. Of 
these eight qualities, it is clear 
that McfJroy has a less-than· 
firm commitment to only two 
of them, mainly "Affirmative 
Action Commitment" and 
"Concern for Undergraduate 
Education." The other six, 
"Academic Qualifications," 
"Community Leadership," 
"Funding Source Expertise," 
"Research Orientation," 
"Concern for Reputation of 
UCSD as a Superior 
Academic Institution," and 
"Adminililrati ve .Qualitieli, " 
can all be reasonably ascribed 
to him, except perhaps the lalit 
one . 
The second question asks 
whether "undergraduate and 
graduate student representa· 
tives" who are now only ex 
officio members of President 
Saxon's joint search 
committee should be elevated 
to voting atatus . . It is not clear if 
this AS committee includes 
itllelf among those students 
who seek formal voting 
privileses. 

The third question again 
alik. us to "prioritize" lome 
ISSUes we would like the 
chancellor to support. Many of 
theie are actually substantive, 
though some are not illues 
over which the chancellor has 

~uch control. The chancellor 
may find it difficult to "bring 

the students closer to the 
community," ali, probably, 
would most students enrolled 
in any courliel which require 
studying (most do). A 
commitment to "interdiscip. 
linary litudies" is laudable, but 
it is already possible to enroll in 
199s, special projects and 
special majors, and last year a 
student by the name of Karen 
Lever was even able to design 
and moderate an excellent 
course which brought in guest 
leelurers in such diverse fields 
as neurochemistry, dolphin 
researdl (John C. Lilly 
himsetr), LSD research 
(Sidney Cohen), anthropology 
and philosophy. 

The others are issues which 
the chancellor does have the 
power to influence, such as 
" Improved transportation and 
bus service," "More child 
care," "Low·cost housing 
around the University," or 
"Student participation in the 
tenure process" (which I 
personally feel IS not as 
burning an issue as others do, 
but then my major department 
already has many brilliant 
profelisors who are eager to 
help their students, and thus 
has no problem with tenure). 

Two other questions simply 
ask for the student's own 
comments. 

It i. difficult for me to ,;ee 
why the AS has created this 
survey. The fael that only 15 
percent of the student body 
bothers to vote should .how 
that most of Wi will not 
interrupt our studies or 
precious leisure activitieli 

(remember those? Many of us 
don't anymore), to participate 
in thili 50rt of activity. UCSD is 
a IiChool, and a challenging 
one at that. 85 percent of the 
students don't vote simply 
because, despite the 
adolescently naive rhetoric in 
the AS student handbook, it is 
not important. 

The AS does little more 
than distribute student fees 
(mainly to itself), and argue 
endlessly over Issues 
unimportant to the general 
student body. We have all shut 
the AS out of our minds, 
because we have many more 
prelising things to take care of, 
day after day, assignment 
after assignment, exam after 
exam, and chapter after 
chapter. What spare time we 
do have is spent unwinding 
from the pressure, socializing, 
and just doing something 
relaxing. It ili more important 
to follow national and global 
issues and to vote in general 
elections. Few of us have time 
to adequately know these 
issues, let alone those of the 
AS. 

Indeed, the "important issues 
on thili campus are rarely dealt 
with by the AS. Oay care was 
fought for by those who sorely 
needed it, not by the AS. The 
ililue of tenure review is fought 
for by students whose major 
departments are ·-mo't · 
affected, not by the AS. 
Affirmative action iii fought for 
by the BSU, SAAC, and 
MECHA, not bY the As .. For 
this reason, mOlt of us are

Editor: 
Our registration procedure 

at UCSD puts an obligation on 
the student to seek proper 
advising and to get the 
ne c essary professors ' 
signatures or department 
stamps on their regilitration 
cards. This burden is not too 
unreasonable when they can 
reach the profesors, but it has 
been ~Iear during the present 
registration period ( as in every 
previous one I've seen) that 
they often can't. 

It is bad enough that some 
professors restriel the students' 
access to them by keeping 
absurdly abbreviated office 
'hours. It'.s bad enough that 
lOme department offices seem 
to be indifferent to the 
students' problems and fail to 
help either in reaching a 
professor or in offering the 
student some alternative. 

But when a professor is 
totally absent during the 
critical -to the student -
days when programs need to 
be approved and cards to be 
signed, it is a seriouti 
dereliction of professorial 
duties and a callous disregard 
of the litudents' welfare.

Help for Those Re-entering Academic World 
8, Alice Rockey 

U you walk over to the Student Center you will see, 
in one of the cubbyholes, the Drop·ln Center for Re-
entry Studenlli. Re.entry is a club formed in 1978 for 
students who have been out of achool for a number of 
yean; and are returning to UCSO to pursue various 
desrees and career goals. With .trong support from 
Beryl Brown, tutorial, program coordinator at 
OASIS, Re·entry is allempting to recognize and 
meet the special needs of UCSO'I 6OO-plus return 
students. We have been allocated a very small room 
in the Itudent center and an even IImaller budget by 
the Associated Students. 

UCSD's re-entry litudents come from various 
occupational and personal backgrounds and 
Iifnty1es but are all related by the simple fact that 
they are older (24·plua.) than the run of the mill post· 
adolescent college a.tudenl. Their ages range from 24 
to 80; they are all united by the simple need to share 

with otheu in the same liituation. 
For many returning studentli, re·entry into 

univeraity life is a kind of culture shock; the world 01 
academics and youthful colleagues is something the 
a.tudent is not prepared to deal with. The age 
difference serves to alienate these students, and 
having a place to drop in and converse with other 
students can be quite a boost to an ailing ego. The 
Re·entry Club also serves as a door through which reo 
entry students can rejoin the student environment. 
After the initial shock, the re·entry !>tudent can relate 
to the broad spectrum of fellow students, youthful or 
not , with a little support from this group. . 

What mailers now is that UCSO doe. not seem to 
recognize and want to meet the special needs of Re· 
entry studenb. There is no fully. funded person in the 
staff office appointed to deal with the Re-entry 
students organization. UCSO i" the only campus in 
the UC system without one. Aillo . there are no 

guidance counselors on hand to advia;e the 
sometimes confused and befuddled returning 
student. 

Re-entry is attempting to get more help from the 
adminilltration, including participation from the four 
colleges in sending representatives to help man the 
center. As it stand, now, the Re·entry Center is lully 
staffed by club volunteers and is opened for drop. ins 
only' when one of these members is ayailable. 

With continued assistance from Beryl Brown and 
others like her, Re-entry is determined to establish 
itself on the UCSO campus. 1he need for lIuch a club 
has always been great, and aa. more and more 
students are waiting to go on to colle..&.e after high 
!oChool, the need increase. quarterly . The Re·entry 
Club will provide guidance, companion hip and 
informational aloltistance to those Itudents who are 
making the difficult transition from jobs or familie:l to 
the world of university life_

UN Security Council 
Will Meet on Iran 

UNITED NATIONS - Security Council members agreed to 
meet on the US· Iran crisis and the council president liaid the 
session probably would begin no later than today despite an 
Iranian plea for a week's delay. 

Council President Sergio Palacios de Vizzio of Bolivia told 
reporters he expected a meeting last night or today in response to 
Secretary.General Kurt Waldheim's urgent request that the 15-

.member council convene on the issue. . 
Waldheim took the unusual step of calling the meeting Sunday, 

saying the conOict over Iranian militants holding 49 American 
hostages in the US Embassy in Tehran threatened world peace. 

Iranian lipecial envoy Saeed Sanjabi told a news conference the 
next few days are "of high political and religious significance" in 
Iran and "we have requested postponement to the next week of 
this meeting." 

In Iran, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini raged against the 
Unit~ States yesterday and told his followers all Iranian!> must 
learn to handle weapons, drop their divisive argumentl; and unite 
with all their might against America or "we will disappear for 
ood " g . 

Khomeini broadcast a speech from his headquarters at the holy 
city of Qom to revolutionary guards, asking that they mobilize 
against the "Satanic" power of America. 

And 100 mileli away, in Tehran, the 49 American hostages 
that are his price for return of the deposed Shah Mohammad Reza 
Pahlavi spent their 23rd day as captives in Tehran's US 
Embauy. . 

"An Islamic country ought to be a military one ... Everyone 
mUlit learn shooting and military skills .. .In addition to the religious 
equipment and faith that the youth of our nation possess, they 
must allio be equipped with materials and arms_. _A country that 
will have 20 million youths in a few years lime, should have 20 
million armed men."· .

New Experiments Could Lead to 
'Inexhaustible' Supplies of DNA Material 

By Monica Gieben 
Staff Writer 

DNA. One was that the DNA ringll 
can be removed from bacteria, purified 
and put back into the cell. 

and everyone of the progeny from that 
single cell will have that gene." 

One of the promises of this new 
technology is that "it allowll us, for the 
first time, a virtually inexhaustable 
source of any human gene," says 
Helinliki. 

New experimenta in DNA could 
allow more detailed atuciy of genetic 
material and maN production of 

~rtant genetic resourCei. 
DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is the 

infonnational molecule of a cell, and 
stores the genetic directions for cell 
Iynthelis and heredity. 

Ac:c:ording to Donald Helinski, chair 
01 the Biology Deparbnent, he and hili 
auociates are intereoteP in a particular 
kind of genetic element called a 
p1umid - a circular molecule or 
"ring" found in a variety 01 different 
bacteria. 

The second was the discovery of 
certain enzymes that could cut into the 
DNA molecule at a certain point, 
allowing the insertion of DNA into that 
DNA ring. 

"What these two breakthroughs 
meant was that now scientists could 
take DNA or a gene from any living 
organism, whether from human,

Bluestein - Developed Test To 
Help Detect eNS Disorder 

By Steve Walsh 
Dr. Harry Bluestein, of the UCSD School 01 

Medicine, has developed a diagnostic test for 
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus - a seri~us 
disorder 01 the central nervous system - which 
he hopes may help detect new symptoms of the 
disease. 

The central nervous system type of lupus 
affecta the brain and common symptomll 
include psychosis, 

This condition occurs in about one out of 
every 10,000 people, appearing in women nine 
times as often as it does in men. The afniction is 
most common at age 20. 

"Some occurrences of lupus are relatively 
hannless," said Bluestein, "though they may be 
present in a patient lor life." Should the disease 
affect certain important organs, however, it can 
be latal. 

Bluestein explained that certain antibodies 
are found only in CNS lupus patients. 

"These antibodies are present in the cerebral 
spinal fluid at the base of the brain, apparently 
getting there from the circulation, though it is 
not yet known how. 

"CNS lupul> is apparently caused by these 
antibodies reacting with molecules in the 
membranes of the patient's neuronal brain cells, 
either killing them or preventing them from 
sending their electrical messages." 

Bluestein said a diagnostic test for (:NS luput. 
has been developed here. This is important, he 
lI8id, "because a patient who is known to have 
CNS lupus and has been treated for is may 
again be afflicted with the same symptoms of 
the disease later." It is difficult for physicians to 
detect the true cause 01 these new symptoms, he 
added . 

l'h'CI~l' 111m I .. "CI~l' H 

accept the tumors and allow them to 
grow "essentia lly as they would in a 
human, " according to Kaplan . 

"The mice provide a very good 
model for human reaction" to 
chemotherapy, said Paul Bartl, 
business manager for the group. 

Kaplan emphasized , however, that 
it will take some time before it is proved 
that the growth of human cancers in the 
mice is the same as in humans. "But we 
are pretty convinced that the tumors 
retain at least 90 percent of their 
characteristics" after the implantation , 
he said. 

After the tumors have grown in the 
mice (a process which takes from three 
weeks to several months, depending on 
the cancer), sample~ are tranllplanted 
into a tissue culture in the labora tory , 
where the biochemistry pf the tumor is 
studied. By ob~erving what substances 
are helpful and what substances are 
harmful to the growth of the tumors , 
the researchers can determine how to 
try to inhibit the growth of the cancer in 
the mice, eventually leading to an 
effective treatment for that cancer in 
humans. Kaplan explained. 

Kaplan and Sato are· "just at the 
beginning" of what they feel can be 
accomplished 'with the experiment~. 
They hope to eventually have a system 
which can find treatments for many 
kinds of human cancer. 

They have already found a drug 
which appears to be effective against a 
number of cancers of the colon and will 
soon be used in homan patients, said 
Kaplan . , 

The researchers plan to begin work 
soon linking the growth of tumors with 
nutrition. "We are pretty certain that 
nutrition has a definite effect on the 
growth and inhibition of cancer," 
according to Kaplan. 

Bluestein's research is concerned with lupuli 
when it affects the central nervous system, 
because this tyPe of the disease is the least 
understood. 

In cases like this, he said, there are three 
possible causes of the new symptoms. First, the 
already present lupus could be responsible.

Pro Pitcher Still at UCSD 
By Jon Goetz 
Sports Editor 

At UC D. people think 
Ihnd y M iller is unique 
be<.:ause he plays professional 
ba~eball. In the world of 
baseball, people consider 
Miller strange because he 'b 
interested nut only in I::RA 
statistics and pickoff moveb. 
bul in thinu like ma rine 
sedimenls . . 

" I see myself as a ping.pong 
hall-bouncin!{ between the 
archaic institution of baseball 
and the artificial institution of 
Ihe university:' he ~aid durin f{ 
a recent UCSD scrimmage. a~ 
he unloaded the brown jui<.:e 
from his chaw of tobacco onto 
the sidelines of Olsen Field . 

Miller is the only ex·UCSD 
player now earnin!,( a livin!,( by 
playing a sport. He'~ probably 
the only professional baseball 
player planning on earning a 
living through !-(eophysics. 

After he played ball and 
studied physics for three years 
at UCSD. the Baltimore 
Orioles took Miller on the fifth 
round of the 1974 draft. Since 
then. he ha~ played with five 

minor leagup r1uh~ and heen 
ca lleoup to majors twice, once 
with the Orioles ilnd once with 
the Muntreal Expos. but ju ' t 
rt'mClined for his ··cup of

Ye t his years in the !,(ilme 
haven·t ended his education. If 
anything, playin!{ ba~eball has 
helped in his inlermittent study 
of physicb. and hi~ constant 
study of people . Miller has 
returned in 1975, 1976. and 
1979 to finish hi~ degree from 
Revelle Colle!{e. Later he 
hopes to study at Woods Hole 
Oceano!{raphic In~l itution in 
Massachussetts, affiliated with 
MIT. I::very time he returns to 
study. his brain is refreshed 
f rom the physical itctivity of 
pitching. Doing nothinl,f but 
playing haseball puts him ·' in 
mental retirement". accordinu 
to Miller, and !,(ives him ne~ 
ener!,(y to sludy. "When you 
get away from school. you get 
perspective'" 

Paradoxically. his educa· 
tion ha~ not 'helped him in 
baseball. but has hindered his 
relations with other players 

and team personnel. ··lhere':. 
resenlment because I'm a 
college student. Players come

playcrs like Miller a life that

The women's volleyball 
team surprised everyone but 
themselves lallt weekend as 
they qualified for the 
December national champion· 
ships by finishing third in the 
California regional play·olls in 
Sacramento. 

They will be seeded filth in 
the nationals, behind top 
ranked Azusa Pacific and 
third seeded UC Davis. 

"They didn't take me by 
surprise," said coach Doug 
Dannevik, after the T riton~ 
upset victory over both second 
seeded UC Davis and host 
team Sacramento State, "We 
can play anyone in our level. " 

The Tritons began with 
Davis on Friday. All week the 
UCSD practice keyed on 
preparing lor Davis and their 
tall blockers. UCSD won the 

~cond and third game 15·12 
and 15·6, while Davis took the 

firbt and fourth 15·8. 15·0. In 
the climactic fifth game, 
UCSD advanced to th e 
semifinals with a 16·14 win. 

"They took u~ lightly and 
we stuck it to them," said 
Dannevik. "We knew what to 
expect." 

Next was Sacramento 
State. Before several hundred 
of their fans, the hometown 
school took the first two from 
the Tritons 15.13 , I 5· II. 
.Then UCSD .unlea~hed hitter 
Elaine Bergman on them, and 
won the next three by scores of 
16·14, 19·17, and 15·6. 

After the fourth game, 
which stretched out to 19 
points, the crowd gave both 
teams a standing ovation . 
"That was the best game I've 
ever been a part of," said 
Dannevik. Bergman domina· 
ted that match with her hitting 
style that eventually won her a 
spot on the all· tournament 
team.

The win against Davis set 
up a winner's bn,lcket fina l 
match again:.t top·seeded 
Azu:.a Pacilic, who beat the 
Tritons twice in league play . 
Azusa handed UCSD three 

~traight losbes , 15·11, 15·5, 
15 ·5. They eve ntually 
defeated Davis for the re!,rional 
title in the finaill. 

Davis had worked itself up 
to the top of the loser's bracket 
of the double elimination 
tournament, and they took on 
the Tritons again. This time 
they were more wary of 
UCSD's bkill. "They didn 't 
ta ke us quite so lightly this 
time," baid the UCSD coach. 

The tall Davi~ front line 
blocked almost everything the 
Tritons hit al them. UCSD lost 
this final match 13· 15,2· 15. 
and 13· 15. 

Even ~o. thili left the seventh 
seeded T riton~ in third place. 
first place Azusa, second 
place Davis. UCSD, and 

fourth place Sacr.imento Slilte 
all qualified for the De(;ember 
6·H AlA W Divibion III 
national championships. held 
at Oc<.:idental College . 

Dannevik figures that Illb 
team should '1tlectst hI:! able to 
place in thl:! tup eight teams of 
this 16 team tournament. This 
iii the firbt time a ny UCSD 
women's volleyhall halo 
qualified for a national playoff, 
but it's not likely to be the last. 

" Il>aid thai in three yect rs we 
cou ld win thc national 
championship. Well, we'rc 
way ahead of that schedule." 
says Dannevik. "Next year, 
with soml:! more bodies, we 
could win a nationid 
championship. "

Grateful Dead Shows 
Why They're Not Yet 

"A Long Strange Trip' 
By Gregg LauRhlin 

Staff Writer 
The commercial logo for the Grateful Dead's 1979 Winter 

Tour reads: " 1965·1979 What a Long Sirange Trip it's Been", 
Indeed, the band ha~ come a long way in Ihe last decade or so. 

With several world tours and a dozen or so album~ to their credit , 
the Grateful Dead are one of the most prolific and well·traveled 
bands around. And when they appeared at San Diego's Golden 
Hall last friday and. Saturday nights, the Dead played with a 
harmony -and unity that made it apparent why they've been 
around as long as they have. 

Friday night , Garcia and the band took the stage at 8 and 
starled off with a new song 
from their upcomin.&. album The Daily Guardian 
Everyman's Dead. The new 
song received a polite, though A t 
leu-than· ecstatic greeting r s 
from the audience, but the 
band quickly followed with a 
superb rendition of their 
traditional show-starter "The Promised Land". From then on , the 
Dead played nothing but "old favorites"; getting into excellent 
versions of such crowd-pleasers as Gooel Lovin ', I Need a 
Miracle, The Music Never Sloppeel , and Estimateel Prophet. 

After a 20·minute intermission, the band came back on stage 
and Garcia started it off on guitar with one of his trademarked 
flowing. ethereal leads; meandering about the fret board for five 
minutes or 50, until Bob Weir picked up the beat with a dynamic 
crescendo of rhythm chord~. The audience seemed to sense all at 

Garcia meandered about the 
fretboard until Bob Weir picked 
up the beat with ~ dynamic crescendo. 
once what the band was getting into, and the Dead Heads went 
wild in their seats. Bill Kreutzmann and Mickey Hart joined in on 
their baSI drums·to pound out the beat that distinguil>hes the song, 
and then the whole band got together for an inspiring 15-minule 
version of "No Fade Away"- one of the Dead 's best live songs. 

Early in the !>how, fans could observe a tall, bearded man, 
limping around in the darkneu behind Kreutzmann and Hart's 
elaborate drum sels. Later, the lall one came out of the shadowlI 
and bat on a road case off to the right hand side of the stage. The 
big man, of course, was Bill Walton, a devoted Dead Head since 
his college days. Evidently,'Walton decided that his time would be 
better spent watching the Grateful Dead than watching the 
Clippers get demoralized by Kansas City over at the Sports 
Arena. 
. BOlh the Friday and Saturday night shows were relatively 

short, b'y Grateful Dead standards - about three-and-a·half 
hours each. On · Friday night the Dead encored with a well· 
received version of "US Blues," that left, the house packed and 
begging for more for 20 minules after the house lights came on. 
Highlights of Saturday's performance included "Dark Star," a 
sensational "Sugar Magnolia ," and a predictable encore of "One 
More Saturday Night." On the whole, the band played about as 
tight last weekend as they ever have, and if their San Diego ~hows 
are any indication, the Grateful Dead may have a " long strange 
trip " yet to travel.

At the ripe age of 26, Miller 
has reached the middle-age of 
a baseball player. He'll keep 
throwing until his chances of 
pitching in the majors seem 
slim. But he knows that one 
good year in the big leagues 
means a lucrative multi-year 
contract. This ' is his only

finda an intrinsic joy in being 
on the mound. 

Miller knows he never

to become a good pitcher if he 
hadn't received a boost from 
coach Lyle Olsen and PE

"You've got the ball. You're

says. "You can have a lot of 
fun by fooling people." 

The diagnostic test for cases 
like thilo is as follows: 

Then, "Staph A" ( a protein

component of the antibodies),

New DNA Techniques Preserve

the new ability to synthetically produce 
large amounts of a specific gene, be 
.tudied much more thoroughly, he 
says. 

In addition to aiding in the structural 
anaIysi. of specific gene., recombinant 
DNA techniques may a1l1O be used to 
syntheaize neceslli8l')' human products 
and correct deficiencies of such 
products in individuals . 

"We can essentially convert 
bacteria into factories for the 
production of human products," says 
Helinski, 

An example would be the 
production of insulin, a hormone 
necessary . to all individuals and 
eIIpeciaily diabeticll, who are now 
treated with animal insulin. 

"The way that this is done is to 
isolate the human insulin gene, insert it 
into these ONA rings and put them into 
bacterial cells so that now the 
bacterium has human insulin genes 
and therefore produces human 
insulin," explains Helinski. 

In addition to producing new 
opportunities for medical research, 
these techniques have ,mushroomed 
into projects that deal with such 
subjects as the engineering of 
agriculturally important bacteria. 

One laboratory is in the process of 
taking bacteria that convert 
atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia, a 
neceliSary form of fertilizer for plants, 
and engineering them so that they 
become more effective. 

Thus, according to Helinski, "new 
revolutionary technologies" can also 
save the agricultural industries costs 
for things like fertilizer , since the 
substitute bacteria may be easily and 
inexpensively produced, 

In emphasizing the variety of 
applications of recombinant DNA 
research now underway, Helinski says 
researcherll "are presently 
collaborating with the medical school 
on a research project in which we are 
trying to isolate and compare the 
normal and the defective gene for a 
particular hereditary disease. " 

The Associated Students, University Events, and the Student Center Board 
Cheerfully co-sponsor: 

According to Helinllki, these types 
of projects indi~ate that "in the long 
range future, society is going to be 
faced with a very important question: 
namely, do we want to ul>e 
recombinant DNA techniques and 
genetic engineering to modify human 
cell.? It won't be long before all the 
tools will be there," 

Helinski cites as an example a 
lIituation in which two parents have a 
high probability of giving birth to 
offl>pring with a particular hereditary 
disease such as sickle-cell anemia_ 

"It won't be too far in the future that 
liCientists will be able to tell those 
parents that we can take the egg of the 
woman and introduce the c9rrect gene 
into the egg of the woman to be 
fertilized by the sperm through in vitro 
fertilization techniques , and . to 
reimplant the corrected fertilizeq egg 
into the womb of the woman to provide 
the assurance that the parent's 
offspring will be born as a normal , 
healthy individual."

Genes -
conjure up a very complex set of moral 
and ethical questions that society is 
going to have to face. 

"We have a case here where the 
technological advances are going to far 
outrun society's ability to cope with it 
from a moral or ethical standpoint." 

Helinski explains that some present 
DNA research dealll with the very 
fundamental questions and problems 
of gene expression, while other projects 
are working in more applied areas such 
as agriculturally important nitrogen 
fixing bacteria and genetic 
modification of hereditary diseases. 

"I think we clearly stand to gain a 
considerable amount of basic 
information in the next two or three 
years. As to whether that information 
will actualy be applied, in terms of 
correcting such things as human 
hereditary diseases, it could be another 
10 or 20 years, or maybe not at all," he 
says. _ 

Helinski explains that the work ill 
very closely monitored by a campus 
Safety Committee.
