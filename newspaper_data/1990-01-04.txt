State Lowers Drunk Driving 
Threshold From .10 to .08% 
By RANDY DOTINGA 
Senior StaffWriler 

As few as three alcoholic drinks 
over a two-hour period could mean 
jail time for California motorists, 
under a new drunk driving law that 
took effect Monday. 

On Jan. I, the blood alcohol 
concentration (BAC) at which a 
driver is considered too intoxicated 
to drive in California wa lowered 
from .10 percent to .08 percent. 

According to information pro-
vided by the state attorney general's 
office, a person weighing between 
90 and 150 pounds will reach the 
.08 level after only three drinks 
over a two-hour period. A drink is 
defined as 1 1/4 ounces of80 proof 
liquor, a 12-ounce can of beer, or4 
ounces of wine. 

Four drink over a two-hour 
period will place an 180-pound 
person t the .08 percent limit. 
Under the old .10 percent limit it 
would have taken five drinks. 

The bill to lower the BAC level, 
sponsored by state Sen. Bill Le-
onard (R-Redlands), was passed 
24-3 by the Senate last April, and 
signed into law by Governor 
George Deukmejian in September. 

California is the fourth state to 
lower its BAC limit to .08, follow-
ing Oregon, Utah, and Maine. 

According to administrative 
assistant Betty Klein of Leonard's 
Sacramento office, the senator 
decided on the .08 limit partly 
because it had been previously 
instituted in other states. 

"If [Leonard] had a choice, he 
would say that there should be 
absolutely no drinking and driv-

ing. [But] realistically, he wanted 
to start where he would have a 
good chance of getting the legisla-
tion pas ed .... The other states 
thought [the .08 limit] was realis-
tic," Klein said. 

She added that Leonard may at-
tempt to lower the BAC limit even 
more if .08 is successful in reduc-
ing drunk driving deaths in Cali-
fornia. 

According to the attorney 
general's office, drunk drivers were 
responsible for 2,51 0 fatalities and 
65,000 injuries in California dur-
ing 1988. Drunk driving is the lead-
ing cau e of death among 18-24 
year old. 

Diane Backdahl, administrati ve 
assistant of the San Diego County 
chapter of Mothers Against Drunk 
Driving (MADD), said her organi-
zation was "thrilled" about the new 
law. 

"We view it as one more tool, 
one more thing people will think 
about. ... The average person is 
going to think twice [about drink-
ing and driving]," she aid. 

But the new law is not likely to 
change the behavior of hardened 
drinkers, such as alcoholics, Back-
dahl said. 

"It won 't affect the heavy-duty 
drinker that we can 't,get no matter 
what we do," she said. 

Public Affairs Officer Jim 
Anderson of the San Diego divi-
sion of the California Highway 
Patrol said the new law will re-
quire a "slight adjustment" on the 
part of patrol officers, but not extra 
training. 

According to Anderson, one of 
the main effects of the .08 limit is 

that patrol officer will not have to 
take such a "hard look" at drivers 
who seem to be, due to their driv-
ing and perfonnance on roadside 
sobriety tests, on the borderline 
between sobriety and drunkenness. 

Under the .10 limit, Anderson 
aid, patrol officers might have 

had a borderline driver take an 
extra obriety test or repeat one. 
"Now you're going to say he 's 
probably going to be there [drunk], 
becau e they've dropped it down 
to ,08. You're going to make up 
your mind a little more toward 
taking him to jail than letting him 
go." 

Anderson added that although 
drivers may be arrested for drunk 
driving even if their BAC i below 
.08, such arrests are rare. 

Results from other state with 
.08 limit indicate that the .08 limit 
may decrease drunk dri ving deaths 
in California. Lt. Glen Rader of the 
Patrol Bureau of the Oregon State 
Police said the .081 imit has worked 
"very well" in his state since it was

Three New Colleges Featured In 
Long-Range UCSD Growth Plan 
By PHIL GRUEN 
Senior Staff Writer 

UCSD's Long Range Develop-
ment Plan, recently approved by 
the UC Regents, includes plans for 
both the addition of three new 
colleges and the construction of 
numerous buildings. 

In the future, according to the 

Long Range Development Plan 
(LRDP) , UCSD will accommo-
date an additional 2,000 faculty 
members, 7,000 staff members, and 
10,000 students by the year 2005. 
The plan also includes the approved 
construction of new roads, a 
"University Center," and a "Light 
Rail" system. 

10sophies have not yet been deter-
mined for these colleges, which 
willlikel y begin construction when 
rapid campus population growth 
dictates they should. Collum pre-
dicted that a new college would 
begin construction every four to 
five years to meet expansion needs. 

A.S. Council Allocates Event Fundi~g 
The large number of new bui Id-

ings to be constructed will be built 
in order to accomodate a large in-
crease in tudents and faculty. Cur-
rently, UCSD has 1,825 faculty/ 
researchers, 5,600 staff members, 
and 16,675 students, including 
graduate students. In 10 years, 
those figures will escalate to 3,975 
faculty/researchers, 12,925 taf-
fers, and 26,050 students. UCSD 
currently employs and holds 24, 1 00 
people. In the year 2005, UCSD 
will be a major university with 
42,950 people. 

Vice Chancellor of Admini tra-
tion Wayne Kennedy said that"the 
Regents' approval of the LRDP in 
November brings us closer to our 
goal of growing at a moderate pace 
while maintaining and enhancing 
a physical environment at UCSD."

After postponing over half of 
the scheduled items on its agenda 
until next week's meeting, theA.S. 
Council last night approved mone-
tary allocations for a MEChA event 
and UCSD's entry in San Diego's 
Martin Luther King, Jr. parade. 

The A.S. allocated $650 for 
Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano 
de Aztlan's (MEChA) Chicano/ 
Latino High School Conference 
after listening to several members 
of MEChA explain the benefits of 
the conference. 

MEChA member Mike Garcia 
described the conference, intended 
to encourage San Diego and Impe-
rial Valley Chicano/Latino high 
school students to attend UCSD,

a "an investment in the future." 
Other MEChA members ex-

plained that the conference would 
give Chicano/Latino high school 
students attending a chance to inter-
act with Chicano/Latino students 
who are now attending UCSD. 

The students attending the con-
ference will see the UCSD stu-
dents as "role models," one 
MEChA member said. 

The Council also allocated $600 
for UCSD's entry in the annual 
Martin Luther King Jr. parade. 

According to Scott Parker of 
the Warren dean's office, this will 
mark the "second time UCSD has 
entered [the parade] as a campus-
wide effort." 

Parker said that UCSD has spent 
a lot of time trying to involve stu-
dent in the parade entry "who will

give a diverse repre'ientation of 
UCSD." 

UC Student Assoc ation repre-
sentative Deni e Whisenhunt aid 
that in the past the parade has had 
a "good UCSD turnout." 

In other A.S. activity, Program-
ming Commissioner Matthew Sch-
nurer encouraged the Council to 
attend the Jan. 12 TGIF featuring 
the band Red Hag. He also men-
tioned his proposal for an upcom-
ing W orId Music Serie . 

"We are looking into Caribbean 
music, Salsa," and other types of 
music for the eries, he said. 

At next Wednesday's meeting, 
the A.S. will addres proposed 
amendments to the A.S. Council 
Bylaws, the fighting words i sue, 
and the allocation of $11,800 for 
new media equipment. 

HIATUS 

The increase in the number of 
undergraduate students is expected 
to be handled effectively by the 
addition of the new colleges, each 
of which will be located on the 
northern end of campus. The col-
leges will surround Third College 
to th'" west and north and the North 
Campus Recreation Fields to the 
west and south. Educational phi-

The LRDP outlines the con-
struction of 12 campus buildings 
to be completed by 1993. Eight of 
these proposed buildings will be 
located in the main, "central area" 
of campus. The eastern ection of 
campus will contain three of the 
proposed buildings. The Scripps 
Institute of Oceanography will 
house the other building, the new 
Stephen Birch Aquarium-Mu-
seum, to be located east of La Jolla 
Shores Drive. It i scheduled for 
occupancy in March of 1991. 

The 1989 version of the LRDP 
is a revision of three earlier plans, 
the first of which was drafted in 
1963,and revised in 1966 and 1981.

GI Bill Benefits To Vietnam 
Era Veterans Comes To End 

The nation's mostly widely u ed GI BiIJ education 
benefits are coming to an end. After nearly 24 years of 
contributing to 8.2 million Vietnam era veterans with 
school and training expenses, the Department of Veter-
ans Affairs mailed the program's final checks in Decem-
ber. 

Some 60,000 veterans currently enrolled in schools 
and receiving assistance were notified that their pay-
ments would be stopped when the Vietnam Era veterans 
GI Bill expired in December. The program 's termination 
date was spelled out in legislation passed in 1976, and has 
been widely publicized by VA. 

Educational benefits for Post-Korean Conflict and 
Vietnam-era veterans were earned by serving on active 
duty between 1955 and 1977, and were available for 10 
years after discharge.

UCSD Researcher Receives 
Milken Cancer Award 

UCSD Cancer Center researcher Stephen Howell, 
M.D .• has been selected as a recipient of the Milken 
family Medical Foundation's Cancer Research Award 
for 1989. The $50,000 award was presented in New York 
last month. 

The Cancer Research A ward, which was established 
last year, honor up to eight outstanding clinical and basic 
scientists each year. 

Howell received the award for his pioneering work in 
ovarian cancer. He is currently developing a drug deliv-
ery treatment technique that bombards ovarian tumors 
directly with drug exposure up to 1,800 times greater 
than those received through tandard intravenous ther-
apy. 

Ordinarily, only a few percent of ovarian cancer 
patients survive five years. However, in one study using 
his technique, Howell has achieved a five-year survival 
rate of nearl y 70 percent. 

More than 400 women have undergone the experi-
mental therapy at the UCSD Cancer Center. Howell and

Graduating students may be interested in serving as 
volunteers for Volunteers in Service to America (VIST A) 
a pan of the federal domestic volunteer agency. 

VISTA volunteers serve full-time for one year with 
local, non-profit sponsoring organizations. Service as a 
VISTA Volunteer qualifies some graduates for defer-
ment of most student loans and partial cancellation of 
National Direct Student Loans. Some objectives met by 
VISTA volunteers include helping emergency shelters 
develop programs to meet their needs and working with 
at-risk youth in cities across America.

Vitamin D Found Beneficial 
In Colorectal Cancer Battle 

In a collaborative study, scientists from the UCSD 
School of Medicine and the Johns Hopkins School of 
Hygiene and Public Health have found that people with 
high blood levels of a form of vitamin D may reduce their 
risk of developing colorectal cancer by as much as 80 
percent .. Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of 
death from cancer in the U.S., and is responsible 61,000 
death and 151,000 new cases annually. 

The study is the first to report that a vitamin D 
compound in the blood is associated with a major reduc-
tion in the incidence of colorectal cancer, according to 
Cedric Garland, associate professor of community and 
family medicine at UCSD and principal author of the 
study. 

"Our latest results are based on what we found in the 
test tube, and the picture is very clear. Those who 
developed colon cancer were deficient in vitamin D," 
Garland said. "The lab data provide the most direct, con-
clusive evidence to date, and make an exceptionally 
strong case for the protective effects of vitamin D." 

Garland cautioned, however, that he study results 
should not be interpreted as a recommendation to take 
large amounts of vitamin D, which can be toxic in high 
doses. 

"Presently, the best suggestion is for people to eat a 
variety of foods rich in vitamin D, including fortified 
milk and surface-dwelling fish, suchas tuna and salmon." 

UCNEWS 
Berkeley AS Fails To Renew 
Its Boycott Of Coors Beer 

A bill that would have renewed the ASUC Senate at 
Berkeley's expired boycott of Coors beer was defeated . 
last month. 

The boycott, started almost two years ago, urged 
students and university facilities to stop purchasing Coors 
beer due to the company's alleged racist. sexist, homo-
phobic and unfair labor practices. 

After a heated discussion, the Senators voted 5- 11 to 
cease their boycott of Coors beer. 

Mark Weideman, one of the main objectors to the 
boycott, said that Coors beer made vast changes in its 
hiring practices and treatment of ethnic minorities. 

Citing statistics, many of which were provided by the 
beer company itself, Weideman said that African Ameri-
cans now comprise 30 percent of the management and 
that women account for nearly 23 percent of the brewery's 
work force. 

"The infonnation that I gathered (shows] that Coors 
has make good faith efforts to redeem themselves over 
their past practices," Weideman said. 

Though supporters of the boycott questioned the re-
liability of stati stics provided by the company, Weide-
man said that the NAACP had ranked Coors Industries 
the number one company in terms of treatment of minor i-
ties, thus proving practices had changed. 

Boycott-supporters pledged to resubmit the bill next 
seme ter.

DRUNK: Tougher Legislation Lowers 
Legal Intoxication Level To .08 Percent 
Continued from page 1 

instituted in 1983. 
Rader noted that the BAC level 

of those arrested for drunk driving 
in Oregon has fallen from .20 per-
cent to . 15 since 1983. The per-
centage of those killed in auto 
accidents who had BAC levels has 
also dropped, from 52 percent in 
1983 to 43 percent in 1987. 

However, Rader said these 
drops are also attributable to other 
Oregon anti-drunk driving laws 
passed in 1983, such as one that 
mandated arrest for motorists who 
refuse to take a blood test to deter-
mine their BAC level. 

Maine, which instituted a .08 
limit si nce 1988, has also experi-
enced a drop in drunk driving sta-
tistics, according to James Mon-
tell, a highway safety coordinator 
with the Maine Dept. of Public 
Safety. Drunk driving arrests in 
Maine have risen from an average

of 831 a month in 1987 to 976 a 
month in the first 11 months of 
1989, he said. 

"I think the [.08 limit] gave the 
officers courage and incentive to 
become better at detecting and 
apprehending drunk drivers," 
Montell said. 

The percentage of auto fatali-
ties that were alcohol related has 
also decreased in recent years in 
Maine, Montell said. He added that 
Maine's decision to lower the limit 
to .08 "was the key thing that 
happened in the last couple of years 
that has helped keep this rate 
down." 

Montell said education and 
prevention programs, along With 
patrol officer training, have also 
contributed to the drop. 

Trooper Kent Whitney of the 
Utah Highway Patrol said the .08 
limit in his state has led to an 
increase in drunk driving arrests 
since it was instituted in 1987.

However, Utah has not seen a 
corresponding decrease in the per-
centage offatalities that were alco-
hol related. Whitney said. 

The .08limit is not the only new 
law facing drunk drivers in Cali-
fornia this year. On July I, Senate 
Bill 1623 will take effect, author-
izing police officers to seize the 
license of a suspected dnmk dri ver 
pending a formal hearing. 

Under this law, drunk drivers 
can lose their license for six months 
for a first offense. and one year for 
a second violation. 

Currently, first-time offenders 
in California are punishable by at 
least 96 hours in county jail and a 
fine of no less than $390, in addi-
tion to the possible suspension of 
driving privileges, according to the 
state Vehicle Code.

Future Shocks 

Winds of Freedom 
1989, which was almost certainly the most important year of 

change since 1968, ended with a bang. The movements for 
democracy around the world have what President Bush might 
call "the big mo," and their momentum is still increasing. 

There was a certain symmetry to the ousting of dictators in 
Romania and Panama, but the differences were stark too. In 
Panama, a well-executed military operation by the United States 
did what the Panamanian people could not do for themselves: re-
moved a murderous thug from power. 

But that murderous thug was powerful largely because ofhe!p 
from the CIA and DEA early in his career. U.S. drug users al 0 
bear much of the blame. The money that Manuel Noriega used to 
buy weapons, and live his lavish lifestyle, came ultimately from 
their pockets. 

In Romania, the people could not tum to the Soviet Union for 
help, but, fonunately, did not need to fear opposition from 
Gorbachev either. In Panama, hundreds died. In Romania, tens of 
thousands. The high price Romania had to pay was largely a 
function of how intrenched Nicolae Ceausescu was. 10 Panama, 
Noriega had not had time to install as complete a security force, 
but the evidence is strong that he was working towards it. The 
"Dignity Battalions" were an embryonic form of secret police. 

Although the intervention in Panama won wide bipartisan 
support, there was some dissent; those who denounce the inva-
sion argue that other solutions were not fully explored. But the 
U.S. sem in an overwhelming force, and still had great difficulty 
putting down the Noriega regime. This suggests that Noriega was 
much more entrenched than anyone thought. 

Rebuilding Panama's economy will be a formidable task. U.S. 
sanctions hit the country hard, and the invasion caused a lot of 
damage. Romania will have mtemational help to rebuild, but 
Panama is the responsibility of the U.S. 

The U.S and Panama have a special relationship, which is 
spelled out in the 1978 Panama Canal Treaty. This gave the U.S. 
the legal right to invade, and it also makes Panama's well-being 
a U.S. responsibility, even had Noriega not been our creation. As 
The New Republic wrote, " in ousting Noriega, we've only begun 
to clean up the mess we've made in Panama." 

Elsewhere in the world, other nations have taken steps toward 
freedom. The Dec. 30 Los Angeles Times had an amazing passage 
in an article on Vaclav Havel's election as Czechoslovakian 
president: "It came one day after Alexander Dubcek, the qusted 
Communist Party chief who led the 'Prague Spring' refonns that 
were crushed in 1968, was named Speaker of the Parliament in 
another stunning rebuke to the repression of the past [see box on 
the opposite page]. 

"It also comes two days after the Bulgarian government 
agreed to talks with the opposition, seven days after the govern-
ment was overthrown in Romania, seven weeks after the Berlin 
Wall was opened by East Germany, five months after a Solidarity 
activist became prime minister of Poland, seven months after 
Hungary opened its borders to West, and eight months after the 
Soviet Union held its first competitive elections in 70 years." 

The Berlin Wall had already lost its meaning, but now it will 
be removed entirely, according to East German leaders. And 
other murderous thugs around the world are worried that they 
face a fate like Ceausescu's. Chinese octogenerian leaders have 
increased security but, despite some hopeful moves (plans to 
allow dissident Fang Lizhi and his wife to leave the U.S. Em-
bassy, for example), are still determined to stay on the outdated 
and intellectually bankrupt Marxist path. 

Freedom is on the rise around the world, and the future of these 
reforms will strongly shape the rest of the century. The 1990s 
promise to be as fast-paced and interesting as the 1980s. 

Abortion is Not Just a Secular Issue 
Editor: 

This IS in response to Andrea 
Adleman'sNov.30commentary, 
"Secularizing Abortion." I spent 
many years as a secular liberal 
activist; I was "pro-choice," a 
fervent atheist, and a very politi -
cal individual. 

One night, one minute in fact, 
atone single moment, I was sound 
asleep in my bed when [ awoke, 
terrified, with cold sweat pouring 
off my forehead, and there was 
the spirit of God. A very unusual 
experience, I assure you- but 
quite real, quite factual. 

Needless to say, I realized that 
I was quite mistaken-Dod was 
very real, and very powerful (there 
is no way to convey these things in 
conversation, but I will do my 
best). And my views radically 
clJanged, not only in terms of 
politics, but in everything else as 
well. 

I was raped repeatedly in my 
freshman year of college and also 
impregnated. It is everything it's 
made out to be--terrifying, hu-
miliating, degrading, and down-
right scary. 

But a human life is sacred; it is 
a blessing from God, and from 
God alone. We are free to believe 
what we want to believe, to act as 
we choose to act, and to o~y or 
disobey any law. Though we have 
the ability to do these things, we 
must also seek to do that which is 
right. And as to your question: 
who is to judge what is right? It is 
simply God alone. 

Our human wisdom, values, 
and philosophies are not without 
merit, but they are not substitute 
to serving God. 

If we are interested in finding 
justice and truth, then at some 
point we shall all realize that our 
mortal opinions and theories are 
just passing views, which are 
replaced easily (no matter what 
creativity or inteIligence we 
showed in our lifetime). 

Abortion is just one action that 
Muslims, Jews, and Christians can 
not stand by and watch, and be 
silent! We cannot be still or be 

silent in the face of evil; we cannot 
condone greed, lust, discrimina-
tion, or murder, and we must fight 
against it, even at the cost of our 
own lives. 

Abol1ion is the destruction of a 
st ill innocent human life. To take 
a healthy embryo out with suction 
or forceps and cause it to die is a 
very, very serious action. It is more 
brutal than rape or assault, and itis 
not a proper solution to an un-
wanted pregnancy. 

[ am not here to argue, or to 

insult you for your views, which 
(believe it or not) I once held. 
They are not picked at random, 
and they are based on your expe-
riences. 

But, as far as "Catholics can 
believe what they want-just leave 
the rest of us alone," this does not 
cut it, because the issue here is 
universal: God is here, He is real, 
and He knows more than we do, 
and the greatest joy on Eal1h is 
finding that out!

A Change in Policy 
In keeping with the New Year tradition of reflecting on the 

past and making resolves for the future, The G.arilian has 
revised its non-sexist language policy. 

After over a year of its ear-jarring reign, "freshperson" is 
stepping out of the GMardian's pages to make room for "first-
year-student," a term our staff hopes you will find more 
suitable. 

When the word "freshperson" firsrappeared, in October of 
1988, , it was greeted with hearty jeers by many. Charges of 
pro-feminist bias and linguistic barbarism flew. But "freshper-
son" survived, until a recent executive board meeting where 
lengthy discussion and often heated debate resulted in its 
demise. 

Our staff places a high priority on reader convenience and 
is firmly committed to providing its readers with streamlined, 
easy-to-read articles. In keeping with that spirit, we decided 
to use standard constructions rOl' words such as "chainnan" 
and "first base man," without reinfOrcing society's unneces-
sary sex-based distinctions by usingwords like "chairwoman" 
when referring to females. llIe GtulrtlMn will continue to 
dem.onstrate its wholehearted approval of attem.pts to combat 
sexism by printing non-standard word constructions, such as 
"councilpcrson," when such words are part of an individual '$ 
official title. 

The idea behind these changes is a simple one: we want your 
reading to be unencumbered by awkward-sounding words. 

At the same time, The GUlJrdil1n does not regret 
"fi:eshperson's" brief reign, as linguistic experimentation goes 
beyond a simple question of semantics. Because language is 
the tool by which we express our thoughts and feelings, it is 
one of the most fundamental outward manifestations of our-
selves and, perhaps provides the most telling indication of our 
collective social ideals. If our little bit of pesky ear-jarring has 
caused anyone out there to re-think his position on our 
culture's deeply-entrenched sexist social bias, then "freshper-
son" was worth the inconvenience. But now it's time for the 
inconvenience to cnd. 

The Gutlrdian wishes you a happy and unencumbered New 
Year.

The Aftermath of the 1968 Prague Spring 
She kept coming back to the speech Dubcek had given over the radio after his return 

from Moscow. Although she had completely forgotte n what he had said , s he could s till 
hear his quavering voice. She thought about how foreign soldIers had arrested him, 
the head of an independent state, in hIs own country, held him for four days 
somewhere In the Ukranian mountains, Informed him he was to be executed - as, a 
decade before, they had executed his Hungarian counterpart [rnre Nagy - then 
packed him off to Moscow, ordered him to have a bath and shave, to change his clothes 
and put on a tie, apprised hIm of the decision to commute his execution, instructed 
him to consider himself head of state once more, sat hIm at a table opposIte Brezhnev, 
and forced him to act. 

He returned, humiliated, to address his humiliated nation. He was so humiliated he 
could not even speak. Tereza would never forget those awful pauses In the middle of 
his sentences. Was he exhausted? Ill? Had they drugged him? If nothing was to remaIn 
of Dubcek, then at least those awful long pauses when he seemed unable to breathe, 
when he gasped for air before a whole nation glued to its radios, at least those pauses 
would remaIn. Those pauses contained all the horror that had befallen their country.

So This Is 
Christmas 
By GAIL JOHNSON, 
Associate Photo Editor 

Grandma may have been a 
grinch this Christmas, but I was 
no Tiny Tim myself. Ho Ho, oh 
no. It was the Holiday from Hell. 

My sister called the night be-
fore I was due home. "Well, is 
there any reason why you wouldn't 
want to spend Christmas with your 
own family?" Lord yes. Millions 
of them. Perhaps this was the year 
to donate my services to a charity 
- for the entire holiday break. 

Tensions, petty arguments, and 
all of those oh so lovely memories 
of holidays past build up to an en-
ticing urge to run. 

They'll never let me forget the 
year I proclaimed Santa to be a rat 
fink, much less the Christmas Eve 
I sprained my back under the 
Christmas Tree in front of all the 
visiting relatives. Mom and I 
nursed our various ailments with 
Dick aark that New Year's Eve, 
too stoned on codeine to care.

With the force of23 other holi-

huns that I decided to bring home 
this year. I decided it was time for 
"real" communication. And so 
continued the Holiday from Hell. 

Mom and I spent the day after 
Christmas with Oprah, too stoned 
on Nyquil to concentrate. We 
cuddled under the covers as we 
dozed to the cheerful prattle of 
negaholics (people addicted to 
negativism). And it started to sink 
in. Grandma may have been outto 
ruin the holiday, but I had demol-
ished it before I left San Diego 
County. White Christmases may 

notexiston the edge of the Mojave 
Desert, our favorite family carol 
may be "Grandma Got Run Over 
By A Reindeer," but at least there 
is a tradition.

A new decade has begun. At

of adolescence. To claim to start 
anew belongs only on a greeting

all ducks are birds, but not all 
birds are ducks. However, we all 
have noses. And it matters. 

Starting anew may not be real-

reprioritizc. I had planned to run 
a photo of the first dawn of the 
nineties instead of writing these

I'm too big for our wagon, and 
my sister now has four cats. There 
will be future similar holiday reve-

I predict as much peace within my 
familial ties as there will be peace 
on the planet within the next dec-

a linle easier, there would be 
greater opportunity to enjoy the

PLAN 
Continued rrom page 1 

1963, and revised in I 966 and 1981. 
The 1989 LRDP is unique in that it 
presents five general concepts to 
aid in the physical planning proc-
esses: neighborhoods, academic 
corridors, connections, the Park, 
and the University Center. 

The concept of neighborhoods 
involves clusters of buildings and 
space with distinct boundaries and 
architectural designs. 

driveways will be permitted [in the 
ecological reserve]," and any new 
developments in the grove reserve 
"would require an amendment of 
theLRDP." 

Finally, a "University Center" 
will be created to help make up for 
the lack of a "college town" at 
UCSD. The University Center will 
become a town center or an urban 
hub of sorts, comprising 28 acres 
of campus space roughly located 
where the Mathews Academic 
Complex now stands. 

According to Pat Collum, 
UCSD's director of Physical Plan-
ning, phase one of the University 
Center is already being mapped. 

Tho UCSD Guardian 

tion, the demand for more parking 
spaces and better access to campus 
also increases. 

The LRDP calls for 11,900new 
parking spaces to be added to the 
existing 13,330 (a total of 25,230) 
to meet the parking needs of a large 
campus. This will mean a grand 
total of2S ,230 parlcing spaces. This 
number allows for a ratio of 2.3 
commuters to one parking space, a 
ratio that, according to the LRDP, 
"has proven adequate thus far to 
meet the needs of the UCSD cam-
pus." • I

The academic corridors concept 
is entirely conceptual, as it imag-
ines UCSD divided into five dif-
ferent academic blocks: humani-
ties,lDItth/engineering/physics,life 
sciences, social sciences, and 
marine sciences. The corridors 
cross through the neighborhoods, 
as they attempt to link the 
institution's largest departments. 

Collum explained that the old 
UCSD Bookstore and the Warren 
Theater will be razed, and a Stu-
dent Services Facility containing 
the Admissions Office, the Regis-
trar, the Student Outreach and 
Recruiting Program, Housing and 
Food Services, the Loan Admiru-
strati on, Student Financial Serv-
ices, the J.D. Card Office, and 
possibly the Parking Office will 
take its place. 

The LRDP's parking plan in-
troduces three different phases of 
parking development. Phase One 
continues to look for various loca-
tions for surface lots in the short 
run, and parking structures in the 
long run. Phase Two sees the 
continuation of remote lot devel-
opment with shuttle service (i.e., 
the Third College lots). Phase 
Three will witness the Aevelop-
ment of parking structures at se-
lected locations, if deemed neces-
sary.

Program Looks at 
Press and Presidents 

A historic symposium 
and taping for a public 
television special featuring 
the presidential press 
secrtetaries from the past 
seven administrations, from 
John F. Kennedy to George 
Bush, will be held on 
Friday, Jan. 5, at UCSD. 

"The Presidency, the 
Press and the People." 
which will be produced for 
television by KPBS-TV. 
will be taped before a 
closed audience. The 
program will be submitted 
to the Public Brodcasting 
Service (PBS) for national 
broadcast in spring 1990. 

Particpants in the sym-
posium will include NBC 
news commentator John 
Chancellor, who will act as 
moderator, and former 
presidential press secretar-
ies Pierre Salinger, George 
Reedy, Bill Moyers, 
George Christian, Ronald 
Ziegler. Jerald terHorst, 
Ronald Neesen, Jody 
Powell, James Brady and 
Larry Speaks. Marlin 
Fitzwater, press secretary 
for President George Bush, 
is also expected to partici-
pate. 

The symposium will ex-
amine numerous issues re-
lated to the presidency and 
the media, including the 
role press secretaries have 
played in shaping U.S. 
domestic and foreign pol-
icy. Other issues to be ex-
amined include the chang-
ing role of the press 
secretary since the Ken-
nedy administration and the 
impact of television and 
other communications tech-
nology on the presidency. 

"The Presidency, the 
Press and the People" is 
being underwritten by Ford 
Motor Company. The 
symposium and subsequent 
public television special 
represent the joint efforts of 
UCSD's American Political 
Institutions project and 
University Extension, in 
conjunction with KPBS-
TV.

JUST HANGING OUT 
During Winter Monarch Butterflies Reign In UCSD Grove 

• Story By James c ollier, Features EdiJor 
Walking through the eucalyptus grove north 

of the Mandeville Center, the leaves seem to 
flutter as if they have a life of their own. Careful 
observation shows that these "leaves" are in 
fact monarch butterfl ies -danus p/exippus to 
be exact. The butterflies are currently massing 
on the branches of eucalyptus trees at UCSD in 
a routine winter migration. 

David Marriott, a butterfly collector, taught 
a UCSD extension course last quarter called 
"Introduction to the Monarch Butterfly." The 
butterflies look so much like leaves, Marriott 
said, that "many people don't real ize that they 
are right over their heads." 

"The monarch is the most amazing butterfly 
we have, [because it] migrates on a round trip. 
They' ll fly here and spend the winter and then 
fly back to where they came from," Marriott 
said. 

He said that the butterflies, which have 
orang wings trimmed in black, migrate during 
the winter basically for warmth 

"When the winter chi ll comes, [the butter-
flies] have to do somethin ," Marriott said. 
"The coast is the wannt pot, at I ast 10 
Califorma anyway. The~~ are Califom a but 
terfl m Ii nse." 

The );lro 'e nt'ar Mande Ille pro Ide every 
thmg the rnon rcll Heed to survive the wmter 
chill. Besld s the ,-osla] warmth. al1d th fa t 

that the temperature rarely dips below freezing, 
Marriott said the eucalyptus trees have "mid-
range foliage" that protects the butterflies from 
ground chill and from the wind above the trees. 
Also, the faculty club, just west of the grove,

protects the monarchs from wind chill . 
The monarchs cluster on the east side of a 

tree to get the warmth of the morning sun. In the 
morning while it is still cool. monarchs are very 
sluggish. Marriott said that when he catches 
monarchs in the morning many times they "will 
just hang out on my hand for a While." 

"When it 's warm they' re all through here 
flying around," he said. 

Marriott estimates there are more than 
10,000 monarchs in the grove, and that Ihe 
butterflies have made the UCSD grove what 
Marriott calls a "major over-wintering" site. 

" A lot of places are just motels. They hang 
out for a while and move on. But this place is 
d.efinitely an over-wintering habitat. Theycome 
here to spend the wi nter every time. 

"Now that they are here, they aren't going 
try to find another place. They are going to stay 
here until February," Marriott said. 

Marriott said that he is concerned about the 
monarchs' UCSD home. He said that mon-
archs are very "picky" about their trees and 
limbs. 

" If someone came In and cut thelle Iimb~ off.

David Marriott said if the temperature is cool enough monarchs will just lIang out .• 

Monarchs 
Continued from page 8 

Marriott said he is currently 
working with Campus Planning to 
protect the monarchs' habitat at 
UCSD. The eucalyptus trees in 
the area won't be trimmed. until a 
decision is reached on what to do 
with the area, Marriott said. 

Marriott would like to see the 
area set aside as a nature reserve, 
"so they won't build, prune limbs; 
so they don't do anything [to the 
grove], basically. 

"We need to preserve this phe-
nomena." Marriott said "If people 
come thiough and cut down all 
these trees and build buildings, 
these butterflies will have no place 
to go, which will be kind of sad" 

Marriott is pan of a group that 
works with the Los Angeles Natu-
ral History Museum and its mon-
arch study program. He tags but-
terflies with a sticker that asks the 
finder of the butterfly to mail it to 
the Los Angeles History Museum. 

"I'm the only one tagging south 
of L.A.," he said. 

Marriott said tagging butter-
flies is "relatively new" in Califor-
nia, adding that it staned about five 
years ago. The main reason for 
tagging, he said, is to learn where 
the butterflies go. 

"These may be local butterflies 
that live in the Laguna Mountains. 
Or possibly from some of the 
western states," Marriott said. 

But Marriott said "we don't 
know" exactly where the butter-
flies come from. 

A large amount of butterflies 
need to be lagged because, on the 
average, only two out of 1,000 
tagged butterflies will be found,

Monarchs 
Continued from page 9 

Marriott said. About 25,000 mon-
archs have been tagged, and Mar-
riott said that he has personally 
tagged about 2,000 butterflies. 

Marriott's extension class fo-
cuses on the migrational pattern of 
monarchs. He also said that he 
taught students how to tag, and that 
they "love it." In fact, one of his 
students took. a tagged butterfly to 
Point Lorna (which is about 10 
miles south ofUCSD). 

"Tbe butterfly that one of my 
students took to Point Loma went 
nonh," Marriott said. "How it got 
here is pretty amazing. Once it gets 
close by it'll track down its phero-
mone, and that's a scent that the 
butterflies release. And it's on the 
branches. So once it can locate this 
area fairly close, it'll be attracted 
to the pheromones, and it'lllmow 
it's home again." 

Marriott said that in many 
cases butterflies return to the exact 
branch that they were taken from. 
He also said that a monarch can fly 
up to 80 miles a day. The butterfly 
Marriott's student took to Point 
Loma " probably made it back in an 
hour easy." 

Marriot recently found a mon-
arch from Fortmorgan, Colorado 
at UCSD. The butterfly apparently 
flew over 900 miles. 

"It definately is a record," he 
said. "The previous record was 660 
miles. It's just amazing . 

"The more we tag, the more we 
learn," Marriott said. "It's going to 
take quite a few years to learn 
about the monarchs." 

How to get 
involved: 

Anyone interested in tagging 
butterflies or assisting the mon-
arch study program can contacl 
David Marriott at 274-6817. 

1/ you find a living or dead 
monarch with a small white tag 
affixed to its wing or find the tag 
alone, you can mail it to the Natu-
ral History Museum, Los Angeles, 
CA90007, with a lIOtation o/where

more impressive as they defeated 
nationally sixth-ranked SI. John 
Fisher 67-65. 

Tournament MVP Rapp again 
led the Triton scoring attack with 
14 points and shared rebounding 
honors with all-tournament per-
former Chris Moore. Both Rapp 
and Moore each snared eight 
boards. 

Marshall was especially pleased 
with Moore's election to the Roch-
ester All-Tournament team. 

"Even though he came off the 
bench the whole tournament, they 
recognized that once he came in, 
his play made a real impact on the 
flow of the games." 

The Tritons started their holi-
day roll, which gave them their 
best start since an 8-4 beginning in 
1979, with a 74-69 home win over 
The Master's College on Decem-
ber 16. Rapp wastbe scoring leader, 
as he has been in nearly every 
game this season, with 18 points. 
Gordon McNeill yanked down 11 
rebounds . 

UCSD then took its act up to the 

great Northwest, challenging 
Oregon's Lewis and Clark College 
and Division I University ofIdaho 
on December 20 and 23, respec-
tively. The Tritons left NAIA le-
wis and Clark searching for an 
answer, prevailing 79-72. The 
Idaho contest was a different story, 
as the Vandals bushwhacked 
UCSD, 95-54. 

Despite the apparent one-sid-
edness of the Idaho contest, 
Marshall said that the Tritons 
weren't completely blown oUL 

"We were in the game most of 
the way, but their superior bench 
strength really took its toU on us in 
the second half," he said. 

Marshall also emphasized that 
even though UCSD realistically 
had little chance of beating a Divi-
sion I tearn ofIdaho's caliber, it is 
important for the Tritons to see 
how they match up against schol-
arship teams. 

" Playing a team like Idaho gets 
o ur kids to try to push their game to 
a higher level,"MarsbaIl said. "11lis 
game also helped to point out our 
weaknesses, and gives us a better 
idea of what we need to worlc on 
the rest of the year." 

eduCtltion: a choice & a future 

SPORTS 13 

Perhaps the most amazing fea-
ture of the Tritons' holiday suc-
cess is that they did so well - even 
though Rick Batt has been playing 
with a broken thumb since the game 
against 'The Master's. Despite his 
injury, Batt has still been a fairly 
solid contributor, as he is third in 
Division ill in individual field-
goal percentage at 69.9 percent 
and is also one of the team's lead-
ing rebounders. 

"He's definitely been slowed 
by his bad thumb, but he still played 
very W'ell at Rochester," Marshall 
said. 

Marshall expressed that he looks 
forward to this weekend's La Jolla 
Classic at the UCSD Main Gym. 

"There's always a big, enthusi-
astic crowd for the Spirit Night 
game (Friday]. That always gets 
our kids really excited, and moti-
vates them to play well."

Tritons Win UCSD Collegiate Invitational 

Swimmers Pick Up 
Where They Left Off 

By TOM RIZZUTI 
SraffWrirer 

The NCAA National Champi-
onships are still a couple of months 
away, but seven UCSD swimmers 
had already reserved a spot for 
themselves when the Tritons hosted 
the UCSD Collegiate Invitational 
at Canyon view Pool on Saturday. 
In their first competition in over a 
month, the Tritons defeated teams 
from New Mexico State Univer-
sity and the University of Red-
lands. 

Despite the long layover be-
tween meets, UCSD continued to 
train towards the end of Fall quar-
ter and over the vacation. The team 
practiced from December 10-18 

backstroke (1 :57.50). 
Vance and Thomas are the only 

Triton men who have qualified for 
the nationals, which will take place 
from March 15-17 in Evanston, 
lllinois. 

Five UCSD women have al-
ready qualified, including Sabrina 
Lum, whowonSaturday's50-yard 
freestyle with a time of25: I O. The 
other four include Katy Arnold, 
Jenna Banaszek, Catherine Ca-
prilles, and Joceyln Rothbard. The 
women's national meet will be held 
from March 8-10 in Milwaukee, 
Wisconsin. 

has the same format as the NCAA 
meet. 

Morgan also pointed out that 
the Tritons have really been pre-
paring for next weekend's meet. 
He assessed last Saturday's com-
petition as more of a tune-up after 
coming off a long layoff. 

"We haven't competed [since 
November 18] and we found out 
where we stand today," he said. 

Morgan said that, overall, he is 
happy with the work his team has 
done, including Saturday 's per-
formance. 

"The people who trained hard 
over the past couple of weeks were 
rewarded today." 

and returned on the 27th. The prac-
,..----------------------- tice paid off, as the Tritons domi-

Although seven swimmers have 
already qualified, the Tritons still 
have nine meets remaining and 
hope to qualify several more as 
early as this weekend, when UCSD 
hosts several schools in the San 
Diego Senior Invitational this Fri-
day through Sunday at Canyon-
view Pool.

PHIL'S ANAL YSIS .. .It's down to the wire. Eight teams remain, with all, except 
maybe Pittsburgh, capable of making it to the Super Bowl. And that's not taking 
anything away from the Steelers - these guys crept quietly into the playoffs and beat 
Houston in the House of Pain. Not an easy feat. But Denver willlikeJy crush them in 
Mile High - a House of Utter Pandemonium. The Bills made it to the AFC Champi-
onship last season, but they just don't have it this year. Cleveland doesn't really have 
it either (after all, it's an AFC team), but expect to see the dawg bones on Saturday after 
the Browns chew up the Bills. The Rams-Giants game should be the best matchup of 
the weekend. New York is extremely tough at home in the playoffs, but Los Angeles 
won a road game last weekend over the Eagles and is frothing at the mere thought of 
another crack at the 4gers. The Rams - probably the NFL's second best team-
should pull this one out. With the 1988 home playoff upset to Minnesota looming over 
it, San Francisco is mentally prepared for this contest. Physically, well, they're the 
4gers, and this version could be more powerful than their 1985 Super Bowl squad. 
After all, the 1985 team didn't have Jerry Rice. PHIL recommends that you take ...

entirely overrun, however, by Wil-
liam Jewell. In fact, the Tritons 
took an 11-6 lead early and after 
falling behind 39-33 at the half, 
managed to tie the game at 45 fi ve 
minutes into the second half. But 
five minutes later, William Jewell 
was up by 10. It never got much 
closer, and the Cardinals wound 
lip with the victory by 19 points. 

Forward Chris Ely led the Tri-
tons in the scoring department with 
14. Nancy Caparaz led UCSDwith 
nine assists. 

In the first round game against 
William Paterson, T riton starting 
center Lisa Beaver, who managed 
to score only eight points in the 
other two games combined, tallied 
18 and led both teams in rebound-
ing with 12. 

In addition to Diepenbrock, the 
All-Tournament team included 
Arabie Adams of William Jewell, 
Carrie Bowen of Franklin & 
Marshall, and Jane\ Yilek and Traci 
Wise of Simpson. Wise was se-
lected as the tournament MVP,

But Saturday' s victory over

tough in the final minutes and

who led both teams in scoring (18) 
and rebounding (11), was fouled 
on the other end and hit both of her

Senior goalie Julie Friess, sen-

ior forward Teresa Schwaar, and 
sophomore forward Katy Dulock

Beergammon: Boot Factor 2 
Though few would disagree that backgammon is one of the 

best board games ever invented, even fewer redlize that it can be 
greatly improved with a simple addition: beer. No, even man's 
oldest board game isn't sacred. 

To play Beergammon, play a normal game of backgammon 
using the doubling cube. When the game is over, the loser must 
drink one-quarter of a beer foc every point lost. 

For example, if the game was a double game, the loser drinks 
half a beer. No problem. But if the game was 8,16, or 32 points, 
the consequences can be frightening. A 64-point game and it's 
over. 

To add another twist, Beergammon can be played so that 
every time a player's piece is hit and sentto the bar, he must chug 
half a beer. So, not only is a defeated player penalized for losing 
the game, he also suffers during the game as well. To make 
matters worse still, some Beergammon fans play for up to $1.00 
a point, on top of the suds. Now you can lose your shirt as well 
as your lunch.

Early Saturday morning a few 
weeks ago, while most sound-
minded students were taking ad-
vantage of their free morning to 
sleep in, I found myself joining 
hundreds of early-rising, excited 
kids at a Walt Disney sneak pre-
view. Before long, the lights 
dimmed, the crowd calmed as the 
film started to roll, and we were all 
drawn into the wonderful world of 
underwater animation. 

Walt Disney is presenting its 
twenty-eighth animated film, ''The 
Little Mermaid." For the first time 
since 1959, the film is based on the 
classic fairy tale written by Hans 
Christian Anderson. The story 
follows a traditional theme of a 
young heroine, in this case a mer-
maid, who falls in love with a 
handsome prince. 

"The Little Mermaid" is unique, 
however, in that the heroine is 
part of an entirely different world: 
the ocean. Her love is so strong 
that she is willing to give up her 
world in a desperate attempt to 
fulfill her dream of being a part of 
the human prince's world. 

Despite the predictably sappy 
theme, the film was alive with 

colorful shells, fish, and bubbles. zany artistic talent.

'Prancer' Just Doesn't Fly 
By James E. Ingman 
Contributing Writer 

Orion Pictures'latest film release,"Prancer," attempts to capture that 
magical spirit of Christmas within us all. Yet it soon becomes apparent 
that the movie fails in its quest. 

Jessica Riggs (Rebecca Harrell) fervently believes in the magic of 
Christmas. She surrounds her dismal life with every aspect of Christmas: 
decorations, food, and even Christmas carols in July. Thus, she is 
saddened when she discovers that the third reindeer is missing from her 
town's Santa display. 

She encounters a wounded reindeer, wandering in the forest. She be-
friends it, believing that it is one of Santa's, and hides the animal in the 
shed behind her farm. 

The rest of the film concentrates on Jessica's efforts to care for 
Prancer, conceal the animal from her father (Sam Elliott), and, most im-
portantly, return the reindeer to Santa in time for Christmas. 

What is predominantly missing from "Prancer" is the magical Christ-
mas spirit. Perhaps this is a result of the fact that we never really sense 
a bond between Prancer and Jessica. Sure, she cares, feeds and risks her

'Worth Winning' 15 Worth Seeing 
By Scott Castner 

HIatus Staff Writer 
If you've ever been caught up in multiple romantic relationships all developing at the same time, 

you'll definitely appreciate the storyline of the new Twentieth Century Fox release, "Worth 
Winning." 

Mark Harmon stars in the film as a wealthy uptown bachelor who has considerable difficulties 
keeping relationships going with females. He attributes his problems to being simply too 
selective-which must have something to do with it, since nearly every woman he meets seems to 
instantly fall in love with him. It even seems a little ridiculous at times. When a glorified , beautiful 
woman walks into the room, the whole room, consisting of mostly male bachelors, stops to stare in 
awe. Of course, Hannon gets a date with the girl by casually interrupting all the other wooers and 
relying on his suave conversation skills. 

His friends. most of whom are already married. can't figure out what his Problem is. as they 
watch him fall in and out of relationships with incredible women. So, they decide to engage in one

Picasso painting. lfhe loses. he has to give up his getaway cabin. Harmon reluctantly accepts the

Madeline Stowe. Lesley Ann Warren, and Maria Holvoe play the three seemingly incompat-

course, the marriage is going bad and Harmon sweeps her offher feet. giving her sexual gratification

Philip Aaberg 
Upright 
Windham Hill Records 

Windham Hill Records. 
Yes, Windham Hill Records. 
The same record company that 

brings you yuppified musicians 
with healing crystals stashed in 
their acoustic instruments now 
brings you one of the best boogie-
woogie albums in years. Philip Aab-
erg, keyboard artist, has created 
one of the better musical works of 
art in a long time. 

Aaberg has toured with such 
musical stars as Peter Gabriel, 
Maria Muldaur, Kenny Rogers, and 
the Doobie Brothers. Even musi-
cal great ElVIn Bishop claims that 
Aaberg is "the best piano player 
I've ever heard ." 

Aaberg's latest album, Upright , 
IS a good example of what working 
with such great star can produce in 
a very talented musical mind. He 
describes the album as an example 
of a small town dance on a Satur-

day night. 
The album i a perfect example 

of dance music. Eleven of the 
album's 14 cuts are solely instru-
mental. This ("eates a very ener-
getic and vigorous medley of 
boogie-woogie tunes. 

This is especially true with "Not 
Wot I That," which relies on the 
throbbing beat of Vinnie Colaiuta 
on drums and John Clayton on 
upright bass. As a matter of fact, 
Colaiuta's drum work sounds very 
similar to that of the late John 
Bonham in Led Zeppelin. 

There is, however, something 
strange about this album. In most 
of the songs on the first side there 
is a very familiar melody. The 
theme from the "Peanuts" cartoon 
seems to be inherent in each song, 
as if without it Aaberg would not 
be able to playa bass line on the 
piano. 

Overall, this is a very well-ar-
ranged and performed album. The 
rhythm and blues feel produces an 
emotional and infectious collec-
tion. 

If you like to dance, or even if 
you want something new and dif-
ferent, then this is one of the best 
albums to come out in years. 

But be forewarned : this is not 
rock and roll. This is boogie-woogie 
at its best.

Phil Collins 
... But Seriously 
Atlantic Records 

It seems as though Phil Collins 
doesn't think that people take him 
seriously enough. Never mind the 
fact that he has worked on music 
and produced albums for Eric 
Clapton, Peter Gabriel (before and 
after Gabriel left Genesis), Robert 
Plant, and others, and helped to 
develop the distinctive percussive 
sounds of the '80s, the man just 
can't get no respect! His latest 
endeavor, ... But Seriously , is his 
attempt at getting taken at more 
than "face value." 

I think Collins' strength lies in 
writing from a personal perspec-
tive from the mind of the observer 
and the feelings of the person 
experiencing something. Fortu-
nately, he doesn't abandon this 
strategy on his new album. I think 
this is a sincere attempt at making 
some meaningful statements, but 
you won't find him waving a flag 
with Bono or "dancing with the 
missing" with Sting. He uses, in-
stead, the more subtle inner voice 
of the mind's eye. 

He talks about the war in Ire-

land, the homeless, the poor and 
oppressed, the the problems of 
crime and life in the inner city; 
but, despite the power of these 
issues, he doesn't make a strong 
position. 

He laments that "that's just the 
way it is," asks us to "think twice," 
questions why "it never gets any 
better," or shouts that "we can't 
make it on our own." These might 
be realistic views on the human 
dilemmas he poses, especially given 
the first-person voice he uses, but 
I wish he'd get as angry as he did on 
"I Don't Care Anymore." 

The best lyrics, and probably 
the best songs, are still the per-
sonal ones. "Father to Son," the 
gentle, reassuring advice of a fa-
ther, is very touching, and "Find a 
Way To My Heart" is a definite 
musical standout. "I W ish It Would 
Rain Down" is a moving, compel-
ling song featuring the guitar of 
the blues-wailing Eric Clapton. 

He recruits some heavyweights 
for assistance, like Steve Win-
wood, David Crosby, Steven 
Bishop, and C lapton, but they 
never draw too much attention 
away from Collins, which is some-
times disappointing. 

Collins has his regular backup 
band, including a funky horn sec-
tion and Daryl Stuermer on guitar 
(whom Genesis stole from Jean-
Luc Ponty for playing guitar on 
tours) . 

I liked the album, especially 
because I like Phil Collins' work, 
but I think he needs to take more 
risks and explore other areas. Being 
one of the best musicians of the 

6 HIATUS JANUARY 4, 1990 

'80s, he has lots of room forexperi-
mentation. Perhaps he was so con-
cerned with the criticisms of his 
silly love songs that he forgot how 
meaningful they are to many of us. 

Whitesnake 

By Michael Newton 
Hiatus Intern 

Slip of the Tongue 
Geffen Records 

If you only take interest in the 
hard rock sounds of heavy metal 
on a rare occasion, let the latest 
release by Whitesnake be that 
occasion. The album, titled Slip of 
the Tongue, is simply metal at its 
best. 

Whitesnake has taken an amaz-
ing blend of friction and finesse 
and has created a sound that hits 
like a ton of bricks. Yet it stays 
detailed enough to maintain char-
acter, unlike the work of a lot of 
metal bands, who think that loud 
and fast makes a good album. 

Considering that Whitesnake's 
two previous albums-Slide It In in 
1984 and Whitesnake in 1987-
were very successful, both exceed-

See ALBUMS, page 7 

Albums 
Continued from pale 6 
ing platinum-selling levels by far, 
Slip of the Tongue should have 
success beyond measure. 

Part of what makes the new 
album a cut above the band's pre-
vious work is the addition of an 
amazing new guitarist, Steve Vai. 
For those who are unfamiliar with 
Vai, he is looked up to in the guitar 
world as almost a demigod. His 
incredible technical precision has 
won him various awards in Guitar 
Player magazine, including "Best 
Rock Guitarist" of 1987 and 1988 
and "Best Overall Guitarist" of 
1988. 

Whitesnake's lead singer David 
Coverdale says of Vai: "He is a 
giant of a musician and most cer-
tainly an inspiration for me to 
vocally fly. He is the most musi-
cally articulate musician I've ever 
worked with, weaving sonic tapes-
tries from hell! He explored the 
lyrical and musical structure of the 
songs to create a totally secure and 
unique musical performance." 

Without a doubt, the tight 
guitar playing on the album makes 
the songs reach a level that is well 
beyond what could otherwise be 
reached. 

Before the release of Slip of the 
Tongue , Coverdale was quoted as 
saying, "It's going to be fresh, crea-
tive, balls to the wall." That was 
no lie. The music on the album 
displays a rare diversity, ranging 
from supersonic guitar-grinding, 
screaming,. drum-bashing sets like 

"Kittens Got Claws" and "Cheap 
An' Nasty" to the mellower, closer-
to-sanity "Sailing Ships" and "The 
Deeper the Love." Even though 
the speed of many of the songs is 
not recommended for the weak-
hearted, they all have individual-
ity, which makes Whitesnake's 
music stand out. 

As far as the lyrics go on this 
album, there is once again a great 
deal of diversity--only this time 
the diversity is from great to hor-
rible. The lyrics are co-written by 
Adrian Vandenburg and David 
Coverdale. 

When the lyrics are read from a 
written page, they're usually crea-
tive, although they don't always 
make much sense. 

Once Coverdale gets a hold of 
them, the words become quite 
distorted. Unless you're following 
the song with a lyric sheet or really 
concentrating on the vocals 
(which is difficult, as the instru-
mental part is so outstanding), all 
you hear is a series of unintelligible 
words with a recognizable chorus 
thrown in intermittently. 

This is pretty typical of a metal 
band, but when it is on the same 
tracks as the musical talent of Steve 
Vai, it stands out as a weak link. 

Considering that Coverdale 
came out of the band Deep Purple, 
maybe he's just stuck in his old 
ways: getting away with not per-
forming too well. 

The music more than makes up 
forrheweak lyrics on the album. If 
you enjoy metal, you'll enjoy Slip 
of the Tongue . 

Coverdale put it quite simply: 

"I want to be involved in quality 
rock. Hopefully we've achieved 
that with good songs and high 
caliber musicianship."

Will and the Bushmen 
Will and the Bwlunen 
Capitol Records 

Between the time Ipicked up a 
copy of Will and the Bushmen's 
self-tirled new release and the time 
I sat down to write the review for 
it, I learned something important 
about music. When I first popped 
in the CD and started to listen, I 
immediately thought that it 
sounded like some country band 
that had modified itssound a little 
in order to make it in the pop 
scene. 

I really didn't want to listen to 
much more of it, but I left it on as 
I straightened up my room. When 
it had ended, I didn't think too 
much about it and went on with 
my day. 

I came back later in the day to 
find my roommate and some of his 
friends listening to it. I asked 
them if they liked it and they all 

seemed to think it was pretty good. 
I wondered if maybe I hadn't given 
it a fair chance. 

Over the next week, I listened 
to it several more times, enjoying 
it more each time. I even read 
through the whole set of lyrics it 
came with. 1 became truly im-
pressed with the band once I had 
opened my mind enough to accept 
its different sound. I even told one 
of my more musically open-minded 
friends from home about it in order 
to get more feedback about the 
band. 

-I had made a complete turn-
around in my opinion o(Will and 
the Bushmen and learned that 
repeated exposure to music, com-
bined with an open mind, can lead 
to enjoyment of things that I never 
would have taken interest in. 

The first thing to know about 
Will and the Bushmen is that they 
don't come from L.A., New York, 
or London, like most of the bands 
we're exposed to these days. In-
stead, they represent a struggling 
media center in Nashville, Ten-
nessee. 

Most people would think that 
they are a twangy country band, 
just like I did. Although there is a 
hint of country influence in their 
music, there are many more influ-
ences that are stronger. They com-
bine Southern pop and rock with 
Stax-Volt sou I, Texas garage rock, 
and R&B shouters of the deep 
South to produce a sound that is 
upbeat with meaningful lyrics. 

The one major hit that has come 
off the album is "Blow Me Up," 
which has been getting airplay on 

local popular music stations. 
Will and the Bushmen have 

also released their only video to 
date wi th this song, which is being 
pLayed on many music-video shows 
and stations. PersonaLLy, I think 
most of their other songs are actu-
ally better than "Blow Me Up," 
even though they are getting vir-
tually no publicity. 

Their other songs present a wide 
range of musical styles. There are 
songs that have a serious rock 
sound, like "Three Girls From 
Detroit." There is also a really 
good mellow R&B song called 
"Doubts." 

Some ~ngs like "It's Gonna Be 
Alright" and "Like Laughing" seem 
to focus on lyric quality, although 
they still have catchy tunes. Of 
course, they have a couple more 
songs with pop/rock mainstream 
potential like "Book of Love" and 
"Typical World." 

The band, cO!1sisting of Will 
Kimbrough, Sam Baylor, Mark 
pfaff, and Bryan Ownings was onLy 
formed in 1984, but has developed 
an original, diverse repertoire 
through playing all over the South 
at roadhouses, bars, frat parries, 
and other low-budget gigs. 

Now that they've signed with 
SBK, a division of Capitol Rec-
ords , they've had their chance to 
show the world the appealing 
quality of that repertoire. If they 
can just get enough people to lis-
ten, they'll catch on quickly. For 
now, we'll just have to wait and 
see.

The next young lady is a beau-
tiful blonde virgin who has all of 
the players of the profe sional 
football team she works for after 
her. Needless to ay, he i much 
more impressed with the low-
aced, debonair Harmon. 

The th;rd woman he must per-
suade to marry him is a free-spir-
ited lady who despises the rich 
class that Harmon represents. 
Being the adaptable man that he 
IS, Harmon adjusts himself to be-
come attractive to her without 
looking like he' pur uing her. 

This eventually leads to Har-
mon running around town, trying 
to lead three different lives. To 
keep his end of the deal, he vide-
otapes the women accepting his 
proposals, then proceeds to attempt 
to break off the engagements. 

The story seems a bit unbeliev-
able, predictable, and perhaps

larious. One can't help but laugh 
most of the way through the movie. 

After all, what is the point of a 
comedy other than to make people 
laugh? If the aforementioned flaws 
are ignored, "Worth Winning" will 
delight almost anybody. 

Prancer 
Continued from page 3 
life for the animal, but Prancer is 
not very responsive. 

We fail to ee any warm, touch-
ing, gentle moments between 
human and animal, as in "E.T." 
Unlike E.T.'s departure, when 
Prancer eventually leaves, we are 
not saddened to see him go. 

As a result of this lack of Christ-
mas spirit, the film is able to de-
velop two characters that resemble 
Ebenezer Scrooge from "A Christ-
mas Carol." Abe Vigoda (the 
grandfather in "Look Who's Talk-
ing") comically portrays an ex-
hausted veterinarian who doesn't 
want to help Jessica save Prancer, 
but eventually does. 

H is performance is upstaged 
onl by Cloris Leachman, who 

plays the town's crabby old widow. 
Her character is such a parallel of 
Ebenezer Scrooge that she even 
lives in an old, run-down mansion 
on the outskirts of town. Her per-
formance is so beautifully por-
trayed that she is one of only two 
characters that we really end up 
caring about. 

Where "Prancer" finally 
stumbles and falls is in its aim. It is 
clear that the filmmakers wanted 
to create a movie that would cap-
tivate the child in all of us. Por-
trayals by Elliot, Leachman, and 
Vigoda were executed so that par-
ents would not be bored out of 
their minds, while Harrell and 
Prancer performed solely for 
children's laughter. 

When a film drags on for nearly 
two hours, everyone becomes 
cranky, regardless of age. To top it 
off, we've been awaiting the 
chance to see Prancer fly for most 
of the film. Just when we expect 
him to do so, we are disappointed. 
That's right, folks, Santa's live 
reindeer are never seen flying on 
the screen. 

"Prancer" ends up like an un-
finished Christmas tree. All the 

ornaments are hung, a few lights 
shine bright, but without the 
golden star at the top, the magic 
and pirit of Christmas are 10 t.

In writing the lyrics, the com-
posers intended to reach out to 

adults as well as children, giving a 
universal message to all. 

As for the return of the chal-
lenge of a fairy tale, the vice presi-
dent of Walt Disney explained 
that they are well suited for ani-
mation because of their fantastic 
etting as well as their traditional 

"good verses evil" theme. 
Director John Musker adds, 

"They tend to have a timeless and 
universal quality that appeals to 
practically everyone in some way 
or another."
