Following the longest budget impasse in California state history, legislators early last week signed the final draft of the 2008-
09 state budget, ending an 80-day stalemate over 
the document and guaranteeing the University 
of California significantly less funding than 
petitioned for by the UC Board of Regents in its 
request earlier this year. 

Maintaining essentially the same amount 
of funding the UC system was allotted in the 
previous fiscal year, the new state budget sets 
the university’s operating funds at a total of 
$3.256 billion. This fall, approximately 5,000 
new students entered the UC system, an enroll-

ment figure university officials say will be hard 
to maintain in the future.

“It is difficult to conceive how the university 
could continue taking additional students year 
after year when the state is not providing the 
funding to support this additional enrollment,” 
UC Vice President for Budget Patrick Lenz said.

The UC system kept its promise to enroll 
all eligible students this academic year, but 
dwindling state funds will likely jeopardize the 
continued success of this guaranteed admissions 
policy.

“We believe very strongly that the state needs 
to be funding public higher education at a level 
commensurate with our needs if our institutions

The UC Board of Regents met in Irvine this month to discuss a proposal that aims to rewrite the rules of freshman admission 
eligibility that would go into effect for fall 2012.

The proposal, constructed by the UC Academic 
Senate and discussed in the committee on educa-
tional policy, would amend the rules concerning 
guaranteed admission and give students who are 
not eligible under current guidelines a chance to 
have their applications considered for admission 
under comprehensive review.

UC President Mark G. Yudof expressed tenta-
tive support for the proposal at the meeting and 
told the regents that the changes are headed in the 

right direction.
Later during the meeting, the regents voted to 

begin to take measures that would increase sys-
temwide campus diversity among students, staff 
and faculty in areas including race, geography and 
socioeconomic status. 

According to a systematic study of eligibil-
ity conducted by the Board of Admissions and 
Relations with Schools that began in 1996, the 
rules governing admission not only leave out many 
qualified students, but also exclude a dispropor-
tionate number of racial and ethnic minorities. 

“The folks on the other side of the line were 
dense in diversity relative to those who were 
being included,” former Academic Senate Chair

The American Federation of State, 
County and Municipal Employees 
announced last week that it will pursue 
a ballot measure to increase employee 
participation in the governance of the 
$43-billion University of California 
Retirement Plan.

The union, which represents 
roughly 20,000 UC patient-care tech-
nical and service employees, will 
begin collecting voter signatures in 
October for Assembly Constitutional 
Amendment 5. AFSCME must collect 
694,000 signatures in order for the 
measure to appear on the June 2010 
ballot.

Co-authored by Sen. Leland Yee 
(D-San Francisco/San Mateo) and 
Assemblyman Anthony Portantino 
(D-Pasadena) and introduced in 
February 2007, ACA 5 would amend 
the California Constitution to establish 
a board of trustees to govern UCRP. 

Hopeful that the ballot measure 
would not be necessary, in May 2007 
Yee authored and shifted his energy 
toward a similar initiative — Senate 
Concurrent Resolution 52 — that 
urged the UC Board of Regents to 
grant shared governance for its pen-
sion plan. SCR 52 passed in both hous-
es of the state Legislature in September 
2007, but the regents ignored it. Now, 
with the support of AFSCME, ACA 5 
is moving forward.

There is growing concern among 
UC workers as their pension plan, 
once one of the top-performing in the 
country, now appears to be signifi-
cantly underperforming its peers.

“Even besides conflict of interest in 
the plan’s management and its unsat-
isfactory performance over the past 
years, every other employee in the state 
has a voice in his or her pension — UC 
workers do not,” said Adam Keigwin, 
Yee’s communications director.

UC spokesman Paul Schwartz 
said the university is willing to con-

sider new methods of incorporating 
employee input, but that the UC fac-
ulty does not agree with the creation 
of a new, separate board that would 
add an additional layer of bureaucracy 
and threaten the university’s ability to 
construct employment packages that  
support its recruitment and retention 
needs.

“Although ACA 5 is consistent 
with our commitment to employee 
participation, it does contain some 
provisions that threaten to undermine 
a system that has served the state 
extremely well,” he said. 

Schwartz added that ACA 5 cre-
ates potential conflict of interest issues 
by giving employees decision-making 
authority over their own retirement 
benefits and putting them in the very 
difficult position of having to choose 
between the university’s broader inter-
ests and their own.

AFSCME, however, continues to

FACULTY DEFICIT

Unable to maintain an accept-
able student-to-staff ratio in the 
face of increasing enrollment and 
decreased state funding, UCSD’s 
Skaggs School of Pharmacy and 
Pharmaceutical Sciences will this 
year receive emergency campus 
funds intended to bail the fledgling 
graduate school out of its insuffi-
cient-faculty crisis. 

Upon a visit from the 
Accreditation Council for Pharmacy 
Education next month, campus 
officials must propose a plan to 
dramatically increase the size of the 

Chancellor Marye Anne Fox addresses the incoming freshman class at the 2008 Welcome Convocation and Dinner event Sept. 21 on RIMAC Field. This year saw the largest number of applications in campus history, with a total of 19,690 freshman applicants admitted for 
fall 2008 and winter 2009. The magnitude of the university’s ever-growing applicant pool has UC officials worried over whether the 10-campus system will be able to support such continued growth, considering the stagnancy of state funding.

pharmacy school’s faculty in order 
to meet the mandated faculty-to-
student ratio. Skaggs faces the pos-
sibility of being denied accredita-
tion renewal if failing to do so. 

The plan — currently under 
draft with the cooperation of 
Chancellor Marye Anne Fox and 
the University of California Office 
of the President — would open 14 
new permanent faculty positions, 
requiring an additional $3 million 
in funding.

In their focus-site visit, the 
ACPE will analyze the pharmacy 
school’s individual programs in 
order to ascertain whether suffi-
cient faculty, funds and resources 
exist to maintain these programs.

Skaggs School Dean Palmer 
Taylor said he is confident the 
university will find the resources 
necessary to maintain the school’s 
accreditation, citing the state’s 
recent budget stalemate as reason 
for campus officials’ failure to final-
ize the school’s assistance plan. 

“It would be fair to say that we 
have a plan already,” Taylor said. “It 
just hasn’t been fully agreed upon, 
and I think that’s understandable 
because of the difficulty and slow-
ness of the state budget.”

The Skaggs School budget is 
composed of state support through 
UCOP, student tuition and fees, 
pharmacy alottments from UCSD 
Healthcare, research support and 
philanthropy. The latter two cat-
egories are directed to specific 
research objectives and achieving 
a level of excellence in academic 
pharmacy.   

According to Taylor, Fox 

acknowledges that the pharmacy 
school has been shortchanged by 
UCOP in the past, and says that the 
school must now make up for this 
deficiency.

When the Skaggs School opened 
its doors in 2002, bolstered by the 
abundance of thriving pharmaceu-
tical and biotechnological compa-
nies in the surrounding area, the 
school accepted 24 post-bacca-
laureate students with promising 
GPAs pursuing graduate degrees 
in pharmacy or the Pharm.D pro-
gram. With the grand opening of 
the Pharmaceutical Sciences build-
ing in 2006, the acceptance rate 
increased to 60 percent, leading to 
the issue of insufficient faculty. 

Taylor said that despite the 
problems increased enrollment has 
brought the school, such develop-
ments are necessary to propel the 
institution forward. 

“We needed that diversity of 
income and diversity of programs to 
be a full-fledged pharmacy school,” 
Taylor said. “You just cannot run a 
program with a diversity of courses 
with 25 students per class. When 
we planned the school, we felt that 
60 students per class was the small-
est it could be while still having an 
economy of scale.”

Skaggs School Director of 
Research Communications Debra 
Kain said she is confident that the 
school will receive the funding nec-
essary to continue operations.

“I don’t think anybody feels like 
the accreditation is at risk,” she 
said.

push for shared governance of the 
UC pension plan, especially in light 
of recent reports of pension fund mis-
management. The California Chronicle 
reported last year that John Hotchkis, 
a member of the investment advi-
sory committee at the UC system, 
retained a 1.1-percent interest in his 
former firm Hotchkis & Wiley Capital 
Management, which was chosen in 
July 2004 to manage more than $430 
million in UC equity funds. 

In addition, the East Bay Express 
reported that recent changes in pen-
sion fund management have led to 
decreased investment revenues for 
the university. Specifically, it said that 
contracting with high-priced pension 
consultants and money management 
firms has resulted in the pension plan’s 
unsatisfactory growth performance 
over the past year. 

In response to past pension 
reform efforts, Schwartz said the 
university has now proposed a new 
advisory structure that incorporates 
union representatives into the advi-
sory board. 

According to Keigwin, UC employ-
ees were allocated positions on the 
advisory board, but union members 
have not had a fair chance to take 
advantage of this opportunity. 

“The current advisory group has 
‘electable’ workers, but these are not 
effective,” he said. “The election of 
these workers was a sham, requir-
ing an e-mail address and password. 
Many workers for [the UC system] do 
not have this and many do not speak 
English. The two worker positions 
ended up being filled by members of 
the administration.”

are to continue serving the people of 
California well,” Lenz said. 

Because the signing of the bud-
get was so delayed, the UC system 
has immediately begun scrambling 
to find wasys of cutting campus costs 
so as to best fulfill obligations to both 
students and staff.

“Since the governor signed the 
budget this past week, it is difficult to 
project what cuts will have to occur 
at the campus level,” Lenz said. “[The 
University of California] must protect 
the quality of education delivered to 
our students to ensure reasonable 
class size, the ability for students to 
get the course sections they need 
and the opportunity to graduate in a 
timely manner.”

While the final state budget does 
restore almost $100 million that was 
originally scheduled to be cut from 
the university’s budget, campus offi-
cials are still hard-pressed to com-
pensate for the lack of a projected 
$100-million funding gap by utiliz-
ing reserve funds and cutting back 
on spending to mediate a variety of 
costs, including those stemming from 
inflation.  

“The year-to-year funding from 
the state in the UC budget was 
reduced by only $20 million,” Lenz 

said. “However, the additional enroll-
ment growth, current compensation 
costs, increasing health benefits and 
increasing energy costs will require 
campuses to find over $100 million 
to support these costs.”

As the budget stalemate dragged 
on in the Legislature, anxiety arose 
over how the UC system would cope 
with the lack of a finalized budget 
at the start of the 2008-09 academic 
year. The regents’ final budget could 
not be officially enacted until a signed 
state budget had been produced.

Had the impasse continued, the 
UC system would have resorted to the 
use of “non-state” resources, includ-
ing student fees, research funding 
and endowment funds, Lenz said.

“State funding pays for the 
core educational program at [the 
University of California], but as a 
whole, the university has a variety of 
funding sources,” UC Office of the 
President spokesman Brad Hayward 
said. “Because of those multiple fund-
ing sources, we were able to borrow 
internally to get through the state 
budget impasse without a great deal 
of pain, and that probably would have 
continued through November.”

Crescenzo at sdecresc@ucsd.edu.

Brown said, adding that this informa-
tion led Academic Senate data analysts 
to re-examine the university’s eligibility 
construct.

Current policy guarantees UC 
admission to high-school students with 
GPAs in the top 4 percent of their senior 
class and to those among the top 12.5 
percent of all California graduates. 

The proposed changes, if imple-
mented, would guarantee admission to 
students in the top 9 percent of their 
senior class, but limit the number of 
students who are guaranteed admission 
based on statewide ranking to the top 
9.7 percent. 

The university would use its stan-
dard process of comprehensive review, 
extending consideration to students 
who fall outside the requirements for 
both ranking-based categories but who 
meet an unweighted GPA requirement 
of 2.8 instead of the current require-
ment of a weighted 3.0

Under comprehensive review, fac-
tors for admission include an appli-
cant’s special talents, outstanding per-
formance in a particular subject and 
notable improvement in one field. Low 
family income, disadvantageous per-
sonal background, lack of opportunity 
and need to hold a job would all receive 
consideration.

“We brought forward a proposal 
that tries to introduce more fairness and 
more excellence, so we can look at more 

information more closely and give com-
prehensive review,” Brown said.

Although the proposal was written 
with the objective of increasing appli-
cant diversity, several regents agreed 
that it is impossible to predict how the 
changes may affect diversity on UC 
campuses. 

“It is truly a modest proposal 
because most of it will be determined 
basically like it is now, but there is a 
greater fairness and greater accuracy 
by bringing to bear the instrumentality 
of our comprehensive review,” Brown 
said. “We are hopeful that greater fair-
ness and excellence will translate to 
somewhat greater diversity, but we truly 
don’t know.”

Brown acknowledged that the com-
prehensive review system implement-
ed in 2001 has shown a tendency to 
increase diversity in admits. B.O.A.R.S. 
studies show that the proportion of 
admitted students from low-income 
families, rural areas and low-perform-
ing schools has increased since adopt-
ing comprehensive review. 

After using new data from the

Trying to figure out what to do on flights has always been a challenge for me. I always 
bring a book, but almost certainly 
end up next to the family with cry-
ing quintuplets. I also bring my 
iPod, but for whatever reason, my 
music collection just doesn’t seem 
as cool 30,000 feet up. If I’m lucky, 
I can fall asleep, but this normally 
doesn’t happen and more often than 
not I end up simply contemplating 

life or engaged in some awkward 
conversation with the not-always-
so-interesting person next to me.

On my most recent flight, how-
ever, I was lucky enough to fly 
JetBlue, which finds the kindness 
in its heart to bless all passengers 
with over 30 channels of cable TV 
and several more for watching mov-
ies (that is, at $5 a pop). Sure, they 
didn’t feed me a single scrap of food 
on a six-hour cross-country flight, 
but free entertainment is better than 
vital nourishment any day!

So after stowing my carry-on 
luggage in an orderly manner and 
attentively watching the preflight 
safety instructions, I was able to 
spend over four hours switching 
between cable news channels such as 
MSNBC, Fox News and CNN. Over 
this span of time I found myself 
laughing, crying, staring in disbelief 
and experiencing a queasy feeling 
deep inside my stomach that could 
only have resulted from a cross 
between depression and disgust. 

On MSNBC, I had the wonderful 
opportunity to catch “Countdown 
with Keith Olbermann.” I had 
watched Olbermann only a few 
times before and was genuinely 
shocked when I heard what was 
coming out of his mouth. In less 
than 10 minutes, he accused presi-
dential candidate Sen. John McCain 
(R-Ariz.) of claiming to invent the 
Blackberry and single-handedly 
ruining the United States’ economy. 

It is truly amazing what clever 
editing of sound bites can do to 
a politician’s speeches. I honestly 
believe that Olbermann was on 
the verge of standing up out of his 
chair, ripping off his clothes and 
claiming that Sen. McCain was the 
devil incarnate and calling upon 
the American people to strike out 
against the demonic minions of the 
hated Republican Party.

After tiring of Olbermann’s rants 
and raves, I attempted to find sol-
ace in switching over to CNN for 
the legendary insight of Larry King. 
On his panel he had four women, 
two supporters of presidential can-
didate Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.), 
and two supporters of Sen. McCain. 
After each fine lady was allowed to 
make her initial remarks, the scene 
quickly melted into the inevitable 
shouting match, as participants took 
turns rolling their eyes and scoffing 
at one another. Mr. King himself 
tried to maintain his journalistic

State of
Disunion

See DISUNION, page 6

By Matthew McArdle and Simone Wilson
Senior Staff Writers 

It’s no secret that the University of California’s undergraduate population is disproportionate to the racial makeup of the state — enrollment 
figures for blacks, Latinos and other underrepre-
sented minorities lag far behind their white and 
Asian counterparts, especially at first-tier cam-
puses like UC Berkeley, UCLA and UCSD.

What’s also clear is the danger of completely 
disregarding the disadvantages of lower-resource 
schooling in the UC admission process. The solu-
tion to the larger national problem of self-sustained 
poverty must be institutionalized, because if there 
is no chance provided to climb the occupational 
ladder that is higher education, economic scales 
have little to no chance of shifting.

When California voters approved Proposition 
209 in 1996, race consideration ceased to be a 
legal factor in admission to the 10-campus system, 
and university officials have been seeking ways 
to compensate ever since. Community outreach 
programs directed toward minorities were founded 
in an effort to boost enrollment, and some cam-
puses imposed holistic admissions systems allow-
ing a more subjective examination of applications. 
Student-provided information about character and 
background alongside grades and test scores are 
now considered in admission decisions — a change 
that has indeed seen increased minority enroll-
ment. At UCLA, a switch to this system led to 
a 100-percent increase in the number of blacks 
admitted to the campus over the previous year.

Now, after receiving UC President Mark G. 
Yudof ’s blessing, the Board of Regents is preparing 
a significant alteration to the university admis-
sions process that will change decades-old policies 
regarding the percentage of high-school graduates 
guaranteed a spot within the university, as well as 
offer students who have not completed all of the 
required “a-g” college-prep courses or taken certain 
standardized tests an avenue to higher-education 
opportunity. UC proponents believe the changes 
would create more diversity within the student 

population by providing a larger and more varied 
applicant pool.

Specifically, the plan calls for reducing guaran-
teed admission (to at least one UC campus) from 
the top 12.5 percent of all California high-school 
graduates to 9.7 percent, while in turn promising 
a slot on at least one university’s acceptance list 
to those in the top 9 percent of their senior class, 
up from the current 4 percent. Though this would 
not hugely affect the pool of high achievers who 
are accepted based on the current system, it would 
widen the doors for those attending high schools in 
poorer areas, perhaps lacking Advanced Placement 
opportunities and the proper counseling to assist 
them through the rigorous UC admission require-
ments.

The proposal would also give — for the first 
time — students with a minimum unweighted 
grade-point average of 2.8 a chance to receive a full 
comprehensive review of their application by their 
preferred campuses, instead of the previous bar at 
an honors-weighted 3.0. It would drop the SAT II 
Subject Test requirement for all applicants and offer 
students who are missing one or two required class-
es a chance to apply under a new category called 
“entitled to review.” In these ways, the new plan is 
a fair solution to the disappointingly low numbers 
of minority students currently being accepted to 
the university.

There is, of course, one glaring contradiction 
to this proposal, and it’s one none too foreign 
— money, or lack thereof.

The state’s 2008-09 UC budget, announced 
early last week, will maintain UC spending pos-
sibilities at their currently strained state, hardly 
even supporting the growing number of admits the 
university already sees under the more exclusive 
system currently in practice. The new alterations 

would allow about 20 percent of California high-
school graduates the opportunity to be considered 
for admission to the university instead of the cur-
rent 12.5 percent. So, up against each other, how 
could the ever-tightening budget possibly support 
a 7.5 percent review increase in the number of col-
lege-bound Californians?

Most obviously, more applicants means a need 
for more manpower in the assessment process, 
already a monstrous operation that takes time and 
unavailable dollars to sustain.

Most frighteningly, unless we are to sacrifice the 
quality of existing student life — including class 
size, campus resources and affordability — there 
will have to be a greater rejection rate to balance 
out the ballooned eligibility. And, if the new system 
is to be effective and a greater number of minorities 
are accepted who wouldn’t have been academically 
eligible before — and they aren’t all just sent to UC 
Merced or UC Riverside, as often does happen in 
the “guarantee” process — there will be an inevi-
table increase in rejection letters sent to the pool of 
applicants who had better access to resources, and 
who perhaps reached higher academic marks.

What the comprehensive review process will see 
is a magnification of its most controversial parts 
— those which center around trickily subjective 
applicant traits. How to determine exactly who 
didn’t have the opportunity to fulfill a requirement, 
or where a personal hardship should outweigh an 
academic achievement?

So, if there doesn’t magically appear some end-
less source of outside funding, and this new all-
inclusive plan does pan out as planned, just let it 
be known that progressive inclusions will not come 
without a sacrifice of many university-qualified 
students on the other end of the spectrum. With 
a wishing well so shallow and dreams so big, this 
cake can’t be had and eaten too.

Right Place, Wrong Dime
Tightening constraints on the UC budget can’t support a progressive push 

to include minority applicants — valiant as it may be.

Going Green Threatens Food Quality
Dear Editor,

This school year has brought a sustainable 
approach to our growing green university. Visiting 
my old residence last year at the Sixth College 
residence halls, I was amazed at the new carpet 
and furniture made from recycled material, the 
low-flow showerheads and the energy-efficient 
lighting. We have indeed taken one big step into 
the future. I applaud all those who contributed to 
making us green.

A few nights ago I visited my favorite dining 
hall, Sierra Summit. Expecting its signature chick-
en patty sandwich to be as good as always, I was 
deeply disappointed when I found that the bread 
bun took three-fourths of the sandwich, while 
there lay a sliver of chicken in between. It’s not just 
sandwiches or Summit — it’s all the dining halls. 
Visiting other dining halls, I’ve seen the increase 
in meal prices, limit in variety and the downgrade 
in the quality of food.

I’ve only been living in Sixth College Apartments 
for about a week, but I’ve already seen the change. 

Freshmen now receive 2,750 meal points, which 
would be more than enough for food, even with 
the increase in prices. But that leaves sophomores 
with 2,100 points and the mindset to conserve and 
cook on their own since dining-hall dinners cost 
$8 or $9 per dish. Does serving food with plastics 
made from plants and using Fair Trade products 
really cost us that much more?

Don’t get me wrong, I’m all for the green 
revolution and doing my part. But I know I’m not 
alone when I ask: Does going green really limit the 
ability of dining halls to serve good quality food?

6  OPINION THE UCSD GUARDIAN MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 29, 2008

integrity, but I almost certainly 
caught a glimpse of his “Obama 
’08” undershirt when he was cut-
ting to commercial. 

Then, I reluctantly settled in 
to watch the undisputed king 
of cable news mudslinging: Fox 
News and Bill O’Reilly. I have a 
family friend who says he tunes 
in to Fox News ever so often 
to “find out what all the crazy 
people are saying.” I was not dis-
appointed. “The O’Reilly Factor” 
presented me with a panel simi-
lar to the one on “Larry King 
Live,” except that this selection of 
keen political minds was all men. 
Of course, the same shouting 
match ensued, O’Reilly cutting 
off his distinguished participants 
midsentence with seemingly lit-
tle remorse. 

Next up was “On the Record 
with Greta Van Susteren” and 
Part I of her exclusive inter-
view with Todd Palin, husband 
of Republican vice presidential 
candidate, Alaskan governor and 
bona fide superwoman Sarah 
Palin. Mr. Palin has come to 
be known on Fox News as the 
first dude, and his professionally 
groomed facial hair and grown-
out crew cut left no doubt that 
he could indeed kill a moose 
with his bare hands and lift it 
into his F350 without anybody 
else’s damn help. Van Susteren 
attempted to drag interesting 
answers out of the first dude 
but he simply was not up to 
the task of offering any single 
bit of insight into the political 
accomplishments or know how 
that would make his wife a viable 
vice-presidential candidate. 

As I watched hour upon hour, 
I found myself hoping that the 
average American or student at 
UCSD is not honestly consider-
ing these laughable TV shows 
and political pundits as reliable 
sources of information on which 
to base their vote.

Unfortunately, I realize that 
television and the Internet sites 
that accompany it are the domi-
nant outlets when it comes to 
getting political information and 
these programs, no matter how 
blatantly biased, are certainly 
shaping the opinions of millions 
of voting Americans. Sure, Jon 
Stewart and Stephen Colbert 
host really funny and informed 
shows, but they are hardly politi-
cal experts.

These facts are nothing new, 
but election season is upon us 
and most people truly believe this 
election will be one of the most 
important decisions we make as a 
country in decades. Certainly, the 
next president will have a pro-
found effect on the lives of col-
lege students, as we watch tuition 
rise in a troubled economy and 
attempt to find jobs after gradu-
ation. I encourage everybody to 
skip the cable TV and find more 
reliable sources when seeking out 
information about the various 
candidates and their ideas for the 
country. Newspapers, while still 
biased in some regard, usually 
try to present the facts in a much 
more objective and informative 
manner. And there is usually less 
screaming and old men wearing 
hairpieces. Better yet, visit the 
Web sites of both candidates and 
their respective parties where 
you will find exactly how they 
intend to approach nearly every 
issue. Take the time to fashion 
your own opinions and make an 
informed decision.

And, of course, tune into the 
various cable news channels to 
find out what all the crazy people 
are saying.

A fter a six-hour flight and five-hour truck ride through winding 
dirt roads and a lush, green 
jungle, Eleanor Roosevelt 
College senior Amber Fiutko 
arrived at her summer 
destination. However, Fiutko 
would not be lounging on exotic 
beaches or exploring ancient 
ruins while in Latin America. As 
a pre-med student, she would be 
building a health clinic in rural 
Nicaragua and gaining valuable 
experiences through one of UCSD’s 
lower profile medical volunteer 
opportunities.

Project Nicaragua, founded 
two years ago at UCSD, is a 
c om mu n it y - s e r v i c e - or i e nt e d 
organization dedicated to improving 
health conditions in Nicaragua, 
the second poorest country in the 
western hemisphere after Haiti. With 
approximately 80 percent of the rural 
population living on less than two 
U.S. dollars per day, health care is a 
low governmental priority.

“We buy soda for $2 and don’t 
even think twice about it, but for 
them, it’s their entire living,” Fiutko 
said.

As a nonprofit organization, 
Project Nicaragua generates its 
funds from concessions sold at 
Qualcomm Stadium, donations 
from corporations, partnerships 
with programs like the International 
Neurosurgical Children’s Association 
(INCA) and A Ministry of Sharing 
(AMOS) and through the project’s 
own fundraising events, such as 
the upcoming Poker Tournament 
Fundraiser on Nov. 22. All funds 
generated by Project Nicaragua are 
used to update the country’s current 
health care equipment to first-world 
standards, leaving travel expenses to 
be covered by individual members. 
From these funds, the project is able 
to provide basic, yet much-needed 
supplies such as gloves, gowns, gauze 
and other surgical equipment. 

Since its inception, Project 

Nicaragua has facilitated at least five 
trips per year, each lasting roughly 
a week, where groups of four to five 
members have the option of working 
closely with Nicaraguan doctors 
in the capital city’s major hospitals 
while also conducting vital research 
on Spina bifida, a major childhood 
neurological disorder common 
in the region. Members can also 
venture into the rural communities 
of Nicaragua to build local health 
clinics. According to Whitney Kelsch, 
Project Nicaragua undergraduate co-
director, both types of excursions 
allow students to experience third-
world health care first-hand through 

close interaction with doctors and 
patients.

“Everything [about Project 
Nicaragua] is hands-on, from 
volunteer work to fundraising,” Kelsch 
said. “Members are out there talking 
to [Nicaraguan] kids, giving blood 
tests and learning how to analyze 
blood work. You get to do everything 
that interests you on a small scale. 
You get to do now what you would be 
doing in four years.”

Arpan Patel, a Thurgood 
Marshall College alum who visited 
Nicaragua earlier this summer with 
the project, opted to volunteer at 
Managua’s main hospital, El Antonio 
Lenin Fonseca, as well as a children’s 
hospital called La Mescota. For Patel, 
the disparity between U.S. health 

care and Nicaraguan health care was 
evident within seconds of stepping 
into El Antonio Lenin Fonseca — 
he witnessed flies buzzing around 
an emergency room crammed with 
ailing Nicaraguans, with many more 
forming a line outside in hopes of 
seeing a doctor.

“If all you know is hospitals in 
America, you’re going to be shocked 
when you see [a Nicaraguan hospital],” 
Patel said. “These are not ideal 
conditions for medicine. They try [to 
maintain a sterile environment] by 
cleaning people off as they come in, 
but they are just so underfunded.”

At this hospital, Patel had the 
opportunity to observe Nicaraguan 
residents in the operating room, but 
received the most hands-on experience 
at the children’s neurosurgery ward 
at La Mescota, where he shadowed 
Carolina Cantarero, a doctor who 
gave up her residency at El Antonio 
Lenin Fonseca to be La Mescota’s only 

neurosurgeon. At La Mescota, Patel 
witnessed how poor funding prompted 
the various surgeons to fight for their 
time in the operating room. Although 
Spina bifida is a major childhood 
disease in Nicaragua, currently at a 
rate of 2.7 cases per 1,000 live births, 
Cantarero is limited to performing 
neurosurgeries on Thursdays only.

“Even though she has this ward 
full of kids with Spina bifida, some 
as extreme as a kid with his brain 
exposed and hanging out the back 
of his head in a sack, it’s the lowest 
priority at the hospital as far as 
surgery goes,” Patel said.

In an effort to eventually lessen 
the number of cases of Spina bifida, 
Patel conducted research on behalf 
of Project Nicaragua to explore the 
possible causes of the disease. One 
cause that accounts for 70 percent 
of cases is a lack of folic acid during 
prenatal nutrition. 

After conducting several surveys 
with mothers of children with the 
disease, Patel noticed that nearly 
all families surveyed were exposed

Top right: The well-stocked bar and cozy kitchen serve up a broad selection of food and drink, despite the dive bar 
reputation. Bottom: The stylized, custom-made bar sign welcomes visitors to the Tilted Stick with a bit of flair.

If you can get past the dirt — the dirt of the bar, the dirt of the customers, the dirt of the dogs fresh off of Dog Beach — then you can probably get past the 
dirty kitchen and enjoy what is almost universally known 
as the most delicious bar food in San Diego. The Tilted 
Stick, one of the diviest dive bars in Ocean Beach, has 
a reputation and a surf shack decor that can intimidate 
classier beach-goers. Nonetheless, this reputation is part 
of the draw for most of the bar’s patrons. 

The bartenders are renowned for their moodiness 
and the rule list posted behind them accentuates the 
myth. Rule one: If you can’t afford to tip, you can’t afford 
to be here. Rule Eight: If you’re not having fun, you’re 
doing something wrong. The third rule on the list tells 
patrons, in more colorful terms, to keep their dogs 
behaved. Located right off Dog Beach, the Tilted Stick 
may be OB’s only dog-friendly pub.

It’s almost tradition to have a basket of wings — 
served hot, medium, mild, teriyaki, barbeque, Caribbean 
jerk or naked — or an order of mahi tacos and wash 
the meal down with one of the 20 beers on tap, all while 
holding off some drunk patron’s wandering canine. 

A sporadically stocked jukebox partially obscures the 

closet-door entrance to the women’s bathroom and when 
sports games aren’t playing on the bar’s 12 television sets 
the music can go from Journey to Slayer without anyone 
skipping a beat. One rundown pool table gets heavy use, 
and it shows in its torn felt and crooked cues. But the 
table is free, a real rarity. An outside patio offers a quiet, 
shaded and secluded spot to down a beer and a burger 
and fight through a basket of heavenly Cajun fries.

None of the food costs more than $7.75 and half-
orders of wings are available as well as simple starters 
like chips and salsa for as little as $2.75. On top of the 
fantastic food, the Stick has a monthly beach cruiser 
and surfboard giveaway. If you want a great meal after 
a great surf, and you don’t mind a little grime and a lot 
of character, swing into the Tilted Stick. You probably 
won’t regret it.

Imight have made the realization once I crossed the Potomac River and saw the tall, marble column 
of the Washington Monument stand-
ing sentinel over the city. Or perhaps 
it was once I dropped off my things 
and, through the flurry of flyers 
advertising the presidential debates, 
immediately found myself at a semi-
nar hosted by the Brookings Institute 
on congressional campaigning. And 
later, when passing by the White 
House, I was 
blocked by a 
police barricade 
so a stream 
of sirens and 
Suburbans, all 
b u l l e t p r o o f , 
stole down the 
road at more 
than 50 miles an hour — I might have 
understood it then, too.

But the day I walked back from 
work in the misty rain and suddenly 
saw Senator and Democratic 
presidential candidate Barack Obama 
emerge from the Mayflower Hotel 
and wave to a crowd of onlookers, 
it hit me: I’m in a different kind of 
town. 

Leaving San Diego to attend the 
University of California, Washington 
Center, located in the heart of the 
District of Columbia, I had traded 
in tank tops for think tanks and 
earthquakes for earmark spending. 
Here in Washington, suits and ties are 
the uniform of the people and it’s not 
at all unusual to see foreign dignitaries 
stuck at a traffic light while you hurry 
through the crosswalk. The Australian 
Embassy is across the street from 
where I will be living, working and 
taking classes for the next two and a 
half months. The White House is only 
a four-block stroll away. 

In Washington, politics flood the 
streets. Here people passing by hold 
flyers out for interest groups or walk 
around with briefcases containing 

secret security clearance codes and 
intelligence on foreign affairs. It’s on 
the metro, where at 8 a.m. in the 
morning the line is crowded with 
an assortment of people dressed in 
professional attire and reading the 
latest copy of the New York Times 
or the Washington Post. It’s even 
carved into the side of the historical 
monuments, most of which I’d only 
ever seen in history books or movies. 
Politics here thrive on a grander 

stage, a national 
stage, where 
decisions made 
down the street 
impact the lives 
of Americans 
living in 
G a l e s b u r g , 
Michigan and 

Palehua, Hawaii. It’s a strange power, 
an intoxicating one, one that seizes 
the people here with a vehemence 
that I’ve never before heard of, let 
alone witnessed. 

Of course, there are those who 
don’t care as much about politics and 
live life as normal citizens, without 
bringing up the latest Gallup polls 
or the Wall Street bailout package in 
every sentence. My sandwich maker 
at Subway did not mention one thing 
about President Bush, or Congress or 
the Pentagon while chatting with me 
over turkey and, of course, American 
cheese. He was a high school kid 
just working the rounds. But that’s 
not to say he didn’t know the game 
himself — when I threw my trash 
away 15 minutes later, I heard him 
arguing with another customer over 
successful campaign strategies for 
third-party candidate Bob Barr. And 
everyone that I talked to — from 
the producers at my internship who 
were ordering from the Cheesecake 
Factory and watching the presidential 
debate coverage until 2 a.m., to the 
random guy who stopped me in the 
street to demand that I watch the 

debate or else suffer from treason 
— everyone was going to watch the 
debates with a fervor only felt during 
Monday night football. 

I knew that debate-watching 
parties would not be hard to find. 
There were no less than two dozen 
events within a mile radius of the 
Washington Center, all with different 
themes and hosted by different 
organizations. The gay and lesbian 
community hosted an Obama Pride 
party with free food and cheap drinks 
at a nightclub; the DC for Democracy 
group hosted a Drinking Liberally 
party above the 17th Street coffee 
shop; Busboys and Poets, a local 
cafe, showed the debates on large 
HD screens with the in-house band 
performing American themed songs 
afterward. The Ventor Sports Cafe 
even offered $1 shots for any group 
who could guess which word would 
crop up frequently during the debates. 
If I had bet on “fundamentally” I 
wouldn’t have made it through the 
end of the broadcast in a coherent 
state of mind.

Watching a political debate with 
such a well-informed and clever 
crowd was different from watching 
the debate with my friends back home 
in the dorms. The Washington crowd 
of college-age students, middle-age 
businessmen and senior citizens not 
only criticized most of the dispute over 
war strategies — one student in the 
crowd shaking her head and getting 
up for another drink when John 
McCain had trouble pronouncing the 
name of Iran’s President Mahmoud 
Ahmadinejad — they knew exactly 
who was spinning and what the spin 
was. Honest answers, which delved 
into the candidate’s background 
or sponsored legislation, received 
applause while weak responses, 
mostly about the candidates’ love 
for veterans and soldiers, prompted 
disbelief and disappointment. 

Some onlookers cheered for 

McCain’s speech on learning from 
the past in Afghanistan and listing 
his experiences, while others stood 
up for Obama when he reiterated 
the need for withdrawal in Iraq. 
One student even had his laptop out 
in the middle of the bar, reviewing 
ABC’s fact-check listings online as 

each candidate threw out figures and 
totals, telling the bar “That’s complete 
bull!” or “Spot on with that one!” As 
the debate wore on and the replies 
became more convoluted and less 
informative, another student, clearly

slurring his words and gripping the 
back of his chair for support, yelled 
above the voluble buzz of analysis, “I 
don’t care who has a goddamn bracelet, 
it’s not the prettiest senator who gets to 
be president!”

The middle-aged crowd, clearly 
at ease with the 20-somethings 
who shouted obscenities at the bar’s 
television, seemed interested in what 
the younger crowd had to say. One 
woman asked me what I thought about 
McCain’s insistence to suspend the 
campaign until the crisis was solved. 
When I told her my answer — that 
I felt the idea had good intentions 
even though it backfired when Obama 
called his bluff — she smiled, sipped 
on a glass of red wine and said, “That’s 
politics for you. If you’re going to point 
the gun, you better be prepared to 
pull the trigger.” Then she engaged 
another student in a conversation 
centered on the Paris Hilton campaign 
advertisement, trying to figure out who 
exactly Paris Hilton was. Luckily, the 
student was from California and clearly 
up on his popular culture as well as his 
economics.

After a long week spent adjusting 
and settling into a city that is as different 
from San Diego as liberals are from 
conservatives, the debates highlighted 
the fact that politics, in every form, 
dominate the ways and wills of the 
people. It’s not a town built on rock ‘n’ 
roll but policy and politics, a town built 
more than 200 years ago that continues 
through the efforts of half-crazed, half-
genius people who know the difference 
between boondoggle and a blacklist 
and want to make a change.

to pesticides because of their rural 
lifestyle. 

Project Nicaragua aspires to 
change the health conditions of these 
rural areas, offering members the 
opportunity to improve the quality 
of life, one community at a time, 
through well digging, promoting 
health education and building 
regional clinics for the many rural 
citizens who do not have a vehicle 
and must walk days to the capital city 
for treatment. 

Last week, Fiutko and four other 
volunteers initiated the construction 
of a health clinic in the community 
of El Bejuco. Rising at 5:30 a.m. 
to roosters crowing, Fiutko, along 
with John Muir College juniors 
Brian Champagne, Erika Go and 
ERC alumnae Rachel Peterson and 
Jacqueline Suyuo, cleared grass with 
a machete and dug holes waist-deep 
until sundown. 

While Fiutko and her team 
started construction on the clinic, 
American doctors Laura and David 
Parajón finished training a group of 
rural citizens who were elected by 
their communities to become health 
promoters for the various clinics 
the two doctors hope to implement 
throughout Nicaragua. Upon 
completion, this clinic stands to serve 
400 to 600 residents of El Bejuco and 
its surrounding areas.

Along with building a clinic, this 
aspect of Project Nicaragua afforded 
Fiutko extended interaction with 
townsfolk, allowing her to not only 
make a medical difference, but also 
to interact culturally during her time 
in a third-world country.

“They were so welcoming; it was 
just a different society,” Fiutko said. 
“Through translation they kept saying 
‘we are so honored to have you here, 
we have so much love for you all, 

thank you for helping us’ and it really 
puts in perspective how such a little 
thing can make a huge difference in 
these communities.”

Without the conveniences of 
electricity or running water, Fiutko, 
Champagne, Go, Peterson and Suyuo 
experienced life as Nicaraguans. The 
elderly women at the jobsite taught 
the group how to make fresh tortillas 
while Fiutko learned a bit of Spanish 
from a child named Celsia who toted 
a tattered textbook with pictures 
accompanied by their Spanish word 
equivalents.

“Just because we showed an 
interest in their culture, we got to 
learn so much more,” Fiutko said. 
“We really got to know the people we 
were staying with and helping.”

While Project Nicaragua is still 
a fledgling organization, boasting a 
modest 10 to 15 members, the scope 
of opportunities it offers to both 
premed students and students with 
a general interest in public health 
and third-world relief may rival those 
of bigger organizations in terms of 
hands-on experience. 

“Compared to other medical 
organizations on campus like P.A.S.S. 
[the Pre-Medical Association of 
Students for Service], an organization 
that gets you in the door with the 
MCATs and things like that, the 
difference between that and [Project 
Nicaragua] is that we are very direct 
and we immerse ourselves specifically 
in public health — we have a direct 
focus on Latin America and South 
America,” Kelsch said. “While other 
organizations are concerned with 
getting you into med school, our club 
is about the reason why you wanted 
to go into the medical field in the 
first place.”

12 SPORTS THE UCSD GUARDIAN MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 29, 2008

Take a break from the weekly 
routine with a water sports class 
at UCSD Recreation’s Mission Bay 
Aquatic Center.  Each semester over 
1000 students enjoy MBAC while  
wakeboarding, surfing, sailing, 
kayaking, rowing or 
windsurfing their way 
through the semester.

Classes are available 
weekday evenings and 
weekends to accomodate 
even the most studious of 
schedules.  Studying 
has never been 
this much fun!

offensive display.
“Our success came from being extremely 

active around their goal,” Pascale said. “Our 
guys were a little more alert and we were 
able to score on some scrambles in front of 
the goal.”

Senior midfielder Joe Shah chalked the 
offensive outburst up to high energy play 
and determined finishing.

“We just kept pushing the ball up the field 
and at the goal,” Shah said. “We made our 
shots really count; we had a lot of shots and 
a high conversion rate.”

Pascale said that in order for the Tritons’ 
offensive success to continue they must be 
even better in front of the goal than they 
were against Pomona.

“We have some days where we are pretty 
sharp up front,” Pascale said. “As the season 
goes on, we will see fewer opportunities to 
score and we need to take care of goals when 
we get the chance.”

Shah said that the team must improve its 
technical skills as it goes forward if it hopes 
to continue winning.

“We are looking to improve the smooth-
ness of our play and moving the ball well,” he 
said. “Like our coach has mentioned, we are 
bringing the intensity every game and the 
soccer aspect will come later.”

The squad will enjoy two more matches 
in the friendly confines of Triton Soccer 

Stadium, before hitting the road again on 
Oct. 10 when they face Cal State Stanislaus. 
Both players and coaches recognize the 
importance of racking up the conference 
points at home.

“Our conference is based on points and 
anybody can sneak into the conference tour-
nament,” junior forward Tony Choi said. 
“There is always good competition and we 
take every game seriously.”

Pascale said he recognizes the advantage 
of playing at home, but like a true skipper he 
is preaching patience and focus as the season 
heads through the midway point.

“We are trying to take it day by day and 
game by game,” Pascale said. “Every game is 
going to be a war and we need to make sure 
to bring the effort.”

The Tritons took on Cal State Bernardino 
on Sept. 28 and were dominated early en 
route to a 3-0 defeat. Offensively, UCSD 
couldn’t get much going, settling for only two 
shots on goal, while allowing all three goals 
in the first half. The Tritons were unable to 
take advantage of their corner kicks even 
though they had five more than the Coyotes.

The squad will finish its home stand 
against No. 23 Sonoma State University on 
Oct. 3 and Humboldt State University on 
Oct. 5.

bwestcot@ucsd.edu.

Entering the fourth set, the Tritons altered 
their attack to go around the Broncos’ blocking, 
focusing on better passing. Though behind in 
points, Schmidt said she didn’t feel under pres-
sure, and described the team as mentally tough. 

“We are used to fighting back, so when 
we got down tonight we tried to focus on 
serving and passing and playing as a team,” 
Schmidt said. “We focused a lot on serving 
targets and trying to break down their pass-
ing to get them out of their offense, and to 
get ours going.”

The change in strategy worked for the 

Tritons as they went up by as many as 10 points 
in the fourth set and seven points in the fifth to 
easily take the remaining sets 25-14, 15-9. 

Schmidt finished the game with 18 kills on 
0.410 hitting to go along with three aces and 
five blocks while Chen continued to spark the 
offense, recording a double-double with 54 
assists and 11 digs. 

With their latest win, the Tritons improve 
to 11-2, 5-1 CCAA. They will take on Chico 
State in an Oct. 3 away game at 7 p.m.

Tritons added two more goals in the period 
to put the Tritons, putting them up 4-1.

“We got off to a good start, shooting the 
ball well,” head coach Denny Harper said. 
“We caught [LMU] off guard a little bit.”

The Tritons continued the offensive 
onslaught early in the second quarter, scor-
ing another quick goal.

But with less than two minutes remain-
ing in the half and leading 5-1, the Tritons 
began to unravel. LMU scored back-to-
back goals to cut UCSD’s lead to two. With 
18 seconds left in the period, the Lions 
scored a man-up goal to end the half down 
only 5-4. 

With the momentum on LMU’s side, 
UCSD had to come out strong in the 
second half. Senior utility A.J. Kotanjian  
scored two goals early, giving UCSD a 7-4 
lead. The Lions, however, capitalized on 
UCSD ejections to score three unanswered 
goals and tie the game at seven.

With 48 seconds left in the period, 
Kotanjian drew a penalty shot and junior 
two-meter defender Donohoe drilled the 
attempt in the corner of the cage to regain 
the lead for UCSD. 

“At times our offense looked balanced 
and at other times it fell apart and we were 
crowded to one side of the cage,” Donohoe 
said. 

Even while struggling, the Tritons 
entered the final quarter with an 8-7 lead, 
looking to add. Instead, UCSD failed to 
convert on a six-on-five opportunity in its 
first possession of the quarter and allowed 
LMU to tie the game at eight after a coun-
terattack goal with 6:58 left in the game. 

After both teams added a goal, the 
Lions quieted the crowd with two scores 
that gave them an 11-9 lead.

Just when things were looking grim for 
the Tritons, Hunt drew a penalty shot in 
the Tritons’ six-on-five offense. With 1:32 
left in the game, Donohoe converted on the 
penalty to cut the Lions’ lead to one goal.  

The Tritons needed one more defensive 
stop when senior driver Adnan Jerkovic 
stole the ball away from LMU with 39 
seconds left and passed to Hunt, who drew 
another penalty.

Lions Stun Crowd With Last-Minute Goal

ERIK JEPSEN/GUARDIAN 
Freshman goalkeeper David Morton led the Tritons in a solid first-quarter defense against LMU, 
giving up only one goal. The defense faltered late, allowing LMU to come back from a 5-1 deficit.

With the entire crowd on its feet, 
Donohoe made his third penalty shot and 
fifth goal to tie the game. The enthusiastic 
UCSD fans were unable to help the Tritons 
on the ensuing possession when, following 
Donohoe’s ejection, utility Tim Hummel of 
LMU netted the winning shot for the Lions 
and silenced the still-standing crowd.

UCSD had four seconds left in regula-
tion to score and send the game into over-
time, but the Tritons were unable to get a 
shot off and settled for defeat.

LMU’s last goal, which was made in a 
man-up situation, accentuated the prob-
lems that UCSD had on its own six-on-five 
opportunities.

“We started out the game two for two 

on six-on-fives and then we got tired and 
got away from what we were trying to do,” 
Harper said.

The loss brings the Tritons’ record to 
10-3 and 2-1 against Western Water Polo 
Association opponents.

Coming off the loss, UCSD faces a 
tough game with Cal State Long Beach on 
Oct. 2. The Tritons have undoubtedly cir-
cled the game against Cal State Long Beach 
on their schedules considering UCSD has 
lost their two previous meetings.

UCSD will then return home to face 
No. 8 UC Irvine on Oct. 3 at 6 p.m.

WOMEN’S VOLLEYBALL — 
Heading into the weekend, the No. 16 
UCSD women’s volleyball team was 
on a three-game winning streak and 
felt confident about taking on peren-
nial California Collegiate Athletic 
Association powerhouse and No. 1 
ranked rival Cal State San Bernardino 
at RIMAC Arena. After the first two 
sets however, the Tritons were in a 0-2 
hole and fighting to stay alive. Instead 
of panicking, UCSD head coach Tom 
Black focused the team on playing the 
women across the net, and not their 
ranking. 

“We just needed to stay within our 
system and play each play,” Black said. 
“Play the team on the floor and not 
their rep.”

The Tritons went on to take the 
next three sets, 25-16, 25-20, 15-12, 
and took the win against the previ-
ously undefeated Coyotes. The win 
was big for UCSD as it dealt Cal State 
San Bernardino (12-1, 5-1 CCAA) 
its first loss of the season and its first 
CCAA loss of the season for the third 
consecutive year. The win was also 
a reminder of last season, when the 
Tritons fell behind in the first two sets 
and had to rally in the final three to 
take down the then-No. 2 Coyotes. 

UCSD dropped the first set in 
heartbreaking fashion, coming back 
from a four-point deficit to take the 
lead 24-23 on a kill by freshman out-
side hitter Hillary Williamson. Cal 
State San Bernardino battled back with 
a block and a Triton error gave the 
Coyotes a 25-24 advantage for the set 
point where freshman middle blocker 
Samantha Middleborn finished the set 
for the Coyotes with a block. 

The second set was another hard-
fought struggle for the Tritons, as 
they dropped the game 25-22, com-

MEN’S SOCCER — The UCSD men’s 
soccer team got its four-match 
home stand off to a superb start 
with a 3-0 thrashing of Cal Poly 
Pomona in front of a lively crowd 
at Triton Soccer Stadium. Sept. 26 
marked the beginning of a crucial 
run through California Collegiate 
Athletic Association play, and the 
Tritons did little to disappoint. 

With points at a premium in 
a stacked division, the men from 
UCSD made sure to take care of 
business against a Cal Poly Pomona 
team that looked overmatched 
throughout. 

The victory over the Broncos 
earned the squad another three 
points, moving their record to 3-
1-1 in league play and 6-1-1 over-
all. UCSD now has 12 conference 
points and currently sits in a sec-
ond-place tie in the south division 
with Cal State Dominguez Hills.

The Tritons wasted little time 
early on, pressing the Broncos 
from the outset of the match. 
Their attacks led to a multitude 
of chances in the first half and 
their efforts were rewarded with 
two early goals.

In the 30th minute, senior for-
ward Tony Fernandez nearly con-
nected on a spectacular score as 
he controlled the ball and fired a 
bicycle kick on goal. Pomona goal-
keeper Thomas Ryan was able to 
make the initial save, but sopho-
more defender Jared Kukura man-
aged to get his head on the ball and 
put it in the back of the net. The 
goal was the second of the season 
for the Tritons’ impressive young 
defender.

Rather than settle for a one-
goal advantage going into halftime, 
UCSD continued the attack and got 
a boost of energy from some well-
timed substitutes. 

Senior forward Ali Shams entered 
the match and quickly scored the 
first goal of his career on a beautiful 
cross from junior midfielder Kyle 
Parton just before the half in the 
44th minute. Shams’ entrance into 
the game was his first action of the 
season and he took advantage of the 
opportunity, showing that he will be 
ready to play when called upon in 
the future.

After dominating the first half, 
the Tritons picked up right where 
they left off as they netted an early 
goal in the second frame to put 
the match out of reach. In the 
49th minute, senior forward Tom 
Caplan got some space on the right 
side and unleashed a shot on goal. 
His attempt was blocked but the 
rebound was put right on the door-
step of Pomona’s goal and sopho-
more defender Brandon Yee was 
there to clean it up for his first tally 
of the season. Pomona attempted 
to fight back but simply could not 
get anything past senior goalkeeper 
Peter Akman and the stellar Triton 
defense. The shutout was Akman’s 
fifth of the season and eighth of his 
career.

Head coach John Pascale praised 
his team for being extremely focused 
in the final third of the pitch, allow-
ing them to put on an impressive

MEN’S WATER POLO — The packed 
crowd of excited fans who came out to 
watch the UCSD men’s water polo match 
on Sept. 25 could not have asked for a more 
exhilarating contest. Unfortunately, the 
Tritons ended up on the wrong side of it. 

Netting a goal in the last five seconds 
of regulation, No. 7 Loyola Marymount 
University broke an 11-11 tie to defeat the 
No. 10 Tritons in a game that UCSD con-
trolled most of the way. UCSD was unable 
to hold on to a lead against a late-charging 
LMU team. 

The Lions scored a goal right off the 
bat on a backhand shot from the two 
meters, but from that point on, the quarter 
belonged to the Tritons. With 6:22 left in 
the period, UCSD capitalized on a six-on-
five opportunity as senior driver Adnan 
Jerkovic found junior driver Jeff Hunt 
inside for the score. With the game tied at 
one, the Lions had a chance to get that goal 
back from the Tritons with a six-on-five of 
their own. However, freshman goalkeeper 
David Morton stuffed LMU’s attempt.

UCSD took the lead on a breakaway 
goal from junior two-meter Daniel Garcia, 
who stripped the ball from LMU. The

WOMEN’S SOCCER — “Every game is a 
war,” said head coach Brian McManus of 
his top-ranking squad.

The UCSD women’s soccer team is the 
primary target in the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association. Picked by the coach-
es of the conference to win the south 
division, the Tritons just want to make it 
through their conference schedule.

“We have the most difficult con-
ference in the country in Division II,” 
McManus said. “Our goal is to make it to 
the conference playoffs and anything is 
possible from there.”

The team is already well on its way to 
the playoffs. Currently, UCSD sits atop 
the south division with a 7-1-1 overall 
record and a 3-1-conference record.

Opening the season in Washington, 
UCSD posted victories over Central 
Washington University 2-0 and Western 
Washington University 2-1 in overtime. 
Junior midfielder Alexia Zatarain was the 
hero against WWU, scoring both goals 
for the Tritons. The two wins catapulted 
the Tritons to a No. 3 ranking in the 
nation. 

UCSD finished its preseason play with 
a double-overtime tie against Cal State 
San Marcos 0-0 and a 4-0 demolition of 
Texas A&M University-Commerce. 

After losing at San Francisco State to 
open up CCAA play, the Tritons rallied 
off four straight victories.

The most recent victory came against 
Cal Poly Pomona on Sept. 26. Two first-
half goals by senior forward Natasha 
Belak-Berger led the Tritons to the vic-
tory. Her first came in the 29th minute on 
a laser from 15 yards out, and the second 
came just before halftime when she out-

the set. While the set remained close, 
UCSD committed 10 errors in the 
second set and had 16 errors for the 
opening two sets compared to only 
having eight for the three final sets.

 Cutting down on errors and stick-
ing to their game plan, the Tritons 
rallied behind Williamson in the third 
game. The freshman phenom had four 
total kills in the set including the 
team’s last three of the set. Junior out-
side hitter Sylvia Schmidt felt that in 
addition to limiting mistakes, UCSD 
upped its intensity after the first two 
sets, which contributed to the turn-
around. 

“There was a newfound sense of 
urgency where we felt like we had to 
pick up our game right now,” Schmidt 
said. “After we got rolling it gave us 
more hope and we started clicking.”

In the fourth and fifth sets the 

Tritons proved worthy to be contend-
ers for the Division-II championship, 
taking the games 25-20 and 15-12 
respectively and seeming in control 
throughout, hitting 0.333 and 0.391 
respectively.  

Williamson finished the match 
with a career-high 17 kills, while 
senior outside hitters Rebecca Bailey 
and Kimberly Carpenter added 12 
kills apiece. In addition, sophomore 
middle blocker Cara Simonsen had 
a standout game with a career-high 
eight blocks for UCSD. 

After toppling Cal State San 
Bernardino, the Tritons took on No. 
20 Cal Poly Pomona Saturday night 
in the second game of their week-
end series. After taking down the 
first ranked team in the country, the 
Tritons knew that the Broncos were 
not going to just give them the game. 

As play unfolded, Cal Poly Pomona’s 
reputation as the CCAA conference’s 
top blocking team became apparent 
against UCSD, taking the Tritons out 
of their element. The Broncos’ senior 
middle blocker Vanessa Williams and 
junior setter Jasmine Davis stood in 
the way of UCSD all night, defend-
ing the net and throwing off Triton 
offense. 

After leading 20-18 in the opening 
set, Cal Poly Pomona (7-4, 4-2 CCAA) 
scored the final seven points to take 
the first set 25-20; the Broncos’ block-
ing had disrupted the Tritons, resulting 
in several attack errors. UCSD battled 
back with Schmidt and Williamson to 
take the second set 26-24, but lost the 
third set 25-22, after being unable to 
build momentum as a team. 

maneuvered the Bronco goalie and sent 
the shot to the back of the net.

In what McManus considered one of 
the team’s worst performances of the sea-
son, UCSD still found a way to win.

“You’re going to win some games 
playing well, and others ugly,” he said. 
“Our players have set a benchmark, and 
that is to find a way to win. We were able 
to do it against [Cal Poly Pomona].”

UCSD is captained by its four seniors, 
who lead a team with 14 talented fresh-
men. According to McManus, the recruit-
ing class has been plucked from some of 
nation’s most elite club teams.

“All I want the freshmen to do is play 
like they did for their clubs,” he said. 
“They all came from good club teams 
and my goal is for them to keep enjoying 
the game.”

While chemistry would be an expect-
ed problem for most teams fielding so 
many fresh faces, the Tritons are very 
close already, according to McManus. 

Annually one of the premier pro-
grams in the country, the Tritons are 
trying to avenge a devastating loss at the 
hands of rival Cal State Dominguez Hills 
in the NCAA Regional last season. The 
four seniors are leading the charge back 
to the NCAA Championships, a level the 
team expected to be at last season.

“The players that were able to play last 
year did an incredible job just getting to 
regionals,” McManus said. “But we were 
crippled by injuries late in the season. 
Losing to a rival is hard.”
