UCSD students attend 
nationwide conference 
US SA summit addresses 
high er education issues 
By LAURA McGANN 
Associate News Editor 

Scven UCSD students renlrlled 
to C:lInpus this week from the 
Universiry of Colorado, Boulder, 
where The I arional Student 
Congress was held, eager to begin 
enacting the United States Student 
Association 's year long agenda. 

The 01ational Student Congress 
is the anJ1u,11 conference held each 
year by USSA, the nation's largest 
non-partisan, nationwide coalition 
of co lleges and universiti es. 
Working under the slogan 
"Education is a right," snldents 

from member schools meet Jt the 
conference to decide which student 
issues the schools will be addressing 
during the year and what tactics will 
be used to address them. The 
national officers and board of direc-
tors, which are student positions, 
are also decided. 

The two largest campaigns 
decided upon for this school year's 
agenda include a voting campaign 
to increase snldent involvement in 
the electoral process and a cam-
paign calling for the re-authoriza-
tion of the Higher Education Act.

Border Projed ~ains

Program aims to deter 
underage binge drinking 
By KIRSTEN HUBBARD 
Staff Writer 

The San Diego-Tijuana Border 
Project, which targets college-age 
snldents in an effort to reduce 
cross-border underage and binge 
drinking, was designated a national 
Model Program by the Center of 
Substance Abuse Prevention for 
2002. 

The Border Project, primarily 
funded by the County of San 
Diego, was one of 30 outstanding 
substance abuse programs recog-

nized this year amongst 200 
reviewed for their work in reducing 
and preventing 'drug and alcohol 
abuse. 

"All communities struggle to 
fight the incidence of underage 
drinking," said supervisor Greg 
Cox, whose district represents the 
Tijuana border crossing. "But here 
in San Diego County, we have the 
added challenge of our proximity to 
the international border with 
Mexico, where the legal drinking

State budget 
still not passed 
Partisan debates rage 
over funding ellts, taxes 
By EVAN McLAUGHLIN 
News Editor 

T he state of Ca lifornia's bud-
gCt for the 2002-03 fisd year 
remains in gndlock on the asscm-
bly flo r al most a month and a 
h31f after thejunc 30 deadlinc. 

Si nce the Sena te passed a 
lIIodified version of Gov. Gray 
Davis' revision in late june, the 
budget has not been welcollled by 
as embl y Rcpublic;lI1s, who 
would rather slash funding to 
state programs and agencies than 
increase taxcs. The assembly 
failed to pass the budget bill , A.B. 
425, on June 29 and has been 
debating over modilications 
since. 

"Gov. Davis' proposal takes 
spcndin& levels to a new 
extreme,' said Peter DeMarco, 
press sec retary for Assembly 
Republican Leader Dave Cox, 
R -Sacra mento. 

"This is a spending problcm 
and not a revenue problem," 
DeMarco said. "Raising taxes is 
not the solution." 

DeMarco cites a 37-percent 
increase in stare government 
spending during Davis' three-

year tenure that h;IS caused 
Republicans to block the passage 
of thc governor's budget. 

Howeve r, Democrats have 
defended the proposed budget 
because of its commitment to 
funding programs they say arc 
essenti al to the sta te . 

"A.B. 425 reflects the priori-
ties important to the Democratic 
caueu such as providing educa-
tion, healthcare and disabiliry 
assis tance programs," sa id 
Kristal Dekker, a spokesperson 
for Assemblywoman jem~y 
Oropeza, D -Carson. 

"The Conference 
Committee hns already cut $7 
billion from the current budget. 
\Ne ca n cut no more." 

A major point of dispute in 
the state budget has oeen the 
Vehicle License Fee. a car tax 
that was to supplement the bl d-
get with approximately $1.7 bil -
lion by imposing steeper fces 
when registering vehicles . 
Because the Vehicle License Fee 
had in hibited any progress

"/\ lot of students can 't get 
access to education sllIlpl y because 
they cun't afford It ," said UCS D 
Vice PreSident Internal Kevin Hsu. 
an attendee of the conference. 

USS/\ was ini tia ll y formed as an 
organization concerned with srudent 
rights. T he group began in 1946 
alter snldents from 37 cOWloies, 
lI1c1uding the United States, met in 
Prague. Czechoslovakia, to lawlch 
the International Union of Srudents. 
That same year. the United States 
formed its own union of srudents: 
the United States National SOldent 
Association. 

This year's conference included 
dIscussions on tactics for poli tical 
organizing and how to deal widl 
Iss ues faci ng students, especially 
focusi ng on the idea that "no matter 
your race, agenda, class or physical 
ability, you have the right to go to 
college," said UCSD A.S. President 
J enn Brown, a conference attendee. 

Brown, elected to the USSA 
board as chair of the Golden Pacific 
Rq.'ion, which includes California, 
Hawaii, Arizona, Guam and 
America Somoa, will be focusing her 
efforts on a voting campaign and 
worki ng against the Racial Privacy 
Initiative, which would eliminate 
racial sta tistics from the college 
applications process if passed in 
2004. To coordinate these cam-
paigns. "I wi ll be having conference 
calls every other week and I will be 
attending six board meetings during

Hsu was also elected to the board 
and will serve as the chair of the 
National Asian Srudcnt Caucus, a 
caucus within the coalition National 
Peuple of Color Srudem Coalition.

missioner of communications, was

Drinking: 
Underage binging is a 
problem in border area 
Continued from pace 1 
age is 18. 

"[Through the Border 
Pro ject], the County of San Diego 
has committed to working with 
our communi ty partners to reduce 
the negati ve consequences of 
cross-border drinking, and we 
have begun to see success. n 

Every Wednesday, Friday and 
Sa turday nights, thousands of 
young Americans cross the border 
to attend downtown Tijuana night-
clubs, where they dance, socialire 
and consume inexpensive alcoholic 
beverages. Large portions of these 
club-goers are San Diego college 
sOldcnts. 

"Obviously, student; can't legally 
drink when they're 18 or 19 in 
America," said Michelle Haft, a Muir 
sophomore. "But when they cross 

th~ border, they're often so excited 
about drinking legally that they get 
carried away." 

The problem of underage and 
hingt! drinking in Mexico is a 
unique issue lor communities along 
the southwest United States border. 

Differences in alcohol policies, 
such as drinking age (18 years of age 
in Mexico and 21 years of age in the

Women's drop-out rate related to outlook 
A UCSD study shows that the drop-out rate of 

female students in engineering classes relates to an 
attitude shared by many women in engineering: that 
competence in engineering is something they are 
born with. 

\M1en faced with difficulties in engineering class-
es, female students tend to see the problem as an 
issue related to their identities. Female students will 
more often drop classes when faced with difficulties 
than their male counterparts because the female 
students believe that aptitude is a fixed ability, while 
male students tend to see the problem as a chal-
lenge to overcome through mOfe studying or a new 
approach to the problem, according to the study. 

The study finds gender tension in en~ineering 
classes as well. \M1ile female students believe that 
they must work. harder and perform at a higher level 
than male students to prove themselves, male stu-
dents believe that female students are given more 
breaks. 

The study concludes that positive female role 
models at critical points in the college careers of 
fem~le students may help keep women in engi-
neenng. 

A follow-up survey is underway to determine 
how attitudes about intelligence affect high school 
age women. An additional survey for college women 
is being planned. 

Poetry writing workshop to 
be held at Central Library 

A poetry writing workshop will be held Sept. 7 at 
the San Diego Central Library on 820 E St. in down-

third-floor Wangenheim room. 

Only 30 participants will be accommodated. If 
interested in attending. contact Pamela Sanderson at

UCSD to hold Sept. 11 
memorial service 

A special memorial service will be held for the 
UCSD community at noon on Sept. 11 in the Price 
Center. The program will include remarks from 
Chancellor Robert C. Dynes and a carillon presenta-

cell phones produced today. 

Asbeck received a Ph.D. from MIT and has 
worked for the Samoff Research Center in Princeton, 
N.J., as well as the Rockwell International Science 
Center. Asbeck joined the UCSD faculty in 1991.

prominent public health and safety 
problems on both side of the inter-
national border. 

On any weekend night, over 
1.400 United States teenagers and 
<1clults cross the border into San 
Diego toO intoxicated to drive 
legally. 

As a result of cross-border par-
rying, many students experience 
health problems, including 
injuries, sexually transmitted dis-
eases, unw,mted pregnancies, vio-
lence and vehicle crashes caused 
by excessive drinki g - both in 
Mexico and once arriving back in 
San Diego County. 

"College sOldents don't seem 
to understand that T ijuana is [in] 
another country," Haft said. "If 
they make a mistake in 1], it's 

to swap the VLF increase for an 
increase in the cigarette tax is some-
dling I can suPPOrt." 

Meanwhile, the University of 
Ca lifornia has taken the init iati ve 
to make up for cuts to its allm'a-
ti on. Over $20 million has been 
put back in to the UC budget 
since the governor' Nb y revI-
SIO n, 

An additional five -percent cut 
was made to research, allowing 
the lll1 iversity to restore funding 
to the system's new dual admis-
sio ns process, student-i nitiated 
outreach, College Preparatory 
Ini tia tive, Central Valley 
Outreach and Graduate and 
Professional School Outreach. 
The Preuss School, UCSD's K-12 
charter school , will also see an 
augmentation of $400,000 under 

much more severe. When peopl e 
are drunk, they aren't thinking 
normally, and mistakes are even 
easier to make." 

The border project addresses 
the complex problems associated 
with cross-border drinking, includ-
ing two languages, several cultures, 
and numerous layers of federal , 
statt' and local government agen-
cies on both sides of the border. 

Both public health and safety 
components are incorporated to 
permanently reduce alcohol-relat-
ed crime and violence. 

The project has facili tated 
increased awareness of cross-border 
problem-solving and more than 
300 news stories over the past year. 

Increased law enforcement 
operations have also been put into 
effect. Law enforcement officers 
from both sides of the border have 
been checking IDs of young-look-
ing border crossers, enforcing 
public drunkenness laws, detain-
ing severely intoxicated pedestri-
ans, performing crowd control 
strategies and intervening in other

Not everyone supports the 
llle:lSUreS imposed by the project. 
James Powell, a Warren senior, 
fe el strongly about the issue. 

"I think the drinking age 
should remain 18 in TJ and should 
be 18 here, toO," Powell said. "If 
I'm old enough to vote and die for 
my country, why shouldn't I be 
able to drink? .. . It's all about the 
principle of the thing." 

For project supporters, howev-
er, results have been bvorable. 
Since the Border Project was estab-
lished in 1997, there has been a 37-
percent reduction in late-night bor-
der crossers with a blood alcohol 
concentration at or above .08. 

In addition, there has been a 
26- percent reduction in the over-
all number of late-night border-
crossers on combined Friday and 
Sarurday nights. There was also a 
decrease in the number of DUI 
fatalities in the San Diego-Tijuana 
Border region, from 23 fatalities 
in 1999 to five in 2000.

Sawrey said. 

Atkinson has been vocal in hi s 
criticism of the usefulness of the 
SAT lin UC admissions, asserting 
it measured aptitude, not achieve-
ment. and was out of sync with 
what srudents actually needed to 
learn in order to be ready for col-
lege. 

"We need standardized tests 
that bear a demonstrable relation-
ship to what students actually 
study in the high school college-
preparatory curriculum," he said. 
"We also need to focus student 
attention on mastery of subject 
matter rather than mastery of test-
taking skills." 

College Board Associate 
Director of Public Affairs Kristin 
Carnahan said that while the SAT I 
changes are timed closely to 
Atki nson 's cri ticisms and the 
B.O.A.R.S. report, their seeds lie in 
a 1994 srudy done by the College 
Board. 

Many changes suggested by 
that srudy were made; some were 
not, but now are being implement-
ed. 

"What Atkinson said got us to 
be focused a little sooner nn mak-
ing those changes," Carnahan 
said. 

Changes will be mad to both 
~::c tions of the SAT I.

4 OPINION THE U D GUARDIAN MONDAY, AUGUST 12,2002 

Information 
By CHRIS M. TAYLOR 
Staff Writer 

\¥hat do hard-core: pornogra-
phy companies and extremist pro-
life groups have in common ? If 
you answered "a string of highly 
decepti ve, addictive and!or 
unavoida ble Web sites contai ning 
explicit photographs and having 
URLs closely resembling the 
names of major corporations and 
cultural icons," you're correct! 
Congratulations, give yourself a 
cookie. 

Despite the overly complex 
description, most students at UCSD 
know exactly what r am talking 
about. Pornography Web sites have 
long since cied to register URLs, or 
Web addresses, that resemble typos 
uf other URLs (such . as 
Imp:IIWW1JJ.yaho.com, an obvious 
typu of http://WWUI.yahoo.com). 
These sites also register URLs with 
similar names bur different 
domains, such as the infamous 
http://wv.rw.whitthollsu-om (a definite 
surprise tor everyone trying to learn 
about the office of the President at 
Imp:llwww.whiftholm.gov). MoS{ 
studems have probably fallen prey 
to this hady advertisi ng strategy, 
especially at inoppomme times such 
as, say, looking up test materials 
wi th your critical gender study 
group. 

[n an attempt to be idealistic, [ 
was skeptical that pro-life groups 
would sink to this level. Based o n 
the knowletlge that most extreme 
pro-life groups are fundamentally 
religious, it seems ironic that they 
would ,teal an advertising ploy -
:In unethIcal one at that - frum 
comp.lIlies that embody everything 
they despise. 

'1h verify my suspicions, J went 
to Imp:lhuwlV. IIJ'ypepJi.01g, one of 
the su~pect Web sites. This wo uld 
,celli like an appropriate Web ite 
to go to if you were inexplicably 
overCOllle with the urge to 

r~searc h soda. I was alarmed -
though no longer surprised - to 
lind myself looking at dozens of 
pictures of aborted fetuses. Along 
with these pictures came strong ly 
worded warnings to ward off 
abortion as well as any advocates 
of a hortiun . 

Don't get me wrong: [ am very 
pro-life, and I don't lllind defending 
that viewpoi nt. J lowever, [ am 
appalled that these groups reduce 
themselves to marketing strategies 
that deceive Internet users into 
viewing photos they had no inten-
tion of viewing. The makers of the 
site are ambitious: the pictures can 
also be reached via the URLs 
b lip:! hVlV1V. loII /Jfa rrakhan .com, 
b II p :1 hL'lVW .go ryco le71lon . com, 
b I tp :! hVlV1V . 1/(/ I ;01/ a lorgo 11 izat iOlljiw-
il'01llCII ,C01l1 'Ind bttp:llwww. IIJfl IO-
dflJ."'YJ.arll1, among others. 

Not on ly does this strategy reek 
o f poor eth ics, but it also negati ve-
Iv affec ts the attitudes of the 
\; '01l1~ 1l it reaches, destruys the 
organizatiun 's own credibility amI 
refl ects poorly on all other decent, 
intel lecnlal pro-life advocates. 

Ideally, if a woman wishes to 
have an ahortion, she sho uld 

undcr~t ,md what she is doing. That 
do~~ Ilot IllCJn .macking her with 
pictures of ahorted felUses, but it 
docs mean showing her the pros 
Jnt! cons of her situation . 

She should under land why 
pro-lift: groups believe it is a child, 

without ethics 
and therefore murder. She should 
learn why pro-choice groups 
believe it's a lifeless fetus and there-
fore the woman's choice. Ignorance 
is neve r the healthy choice, as we 
all should know by attending uni -
versities where intellectua l enlight-
enment is the goal. 

That said, pro-li fe groups 
should not be deciding whether the 
woman would be ignorant. This is 
about as effective as cigarette pack-
ets' health warnings aimed at 
deterring smokers. Everyone 
knows it's dangerous, but no one 
really bothers to read the warning. 

Aside from being unethical, 
deception ruins credibility. Any 
woman who looks at these Web sites 
will be angry that she was deceived 
into seeing them, and will almost 
certainly continue with the abor-
tion. Because these Web sites have 
the gall to con women into reject-
ing abortion, many people will 
become indignant to the cause. 
This advertising is self-destructive. 

Furthermore, when has the 
Internet ever been a haven of 
undeniable fact? There are 
countless reasons to doubt the 
pictures and sayings of these 
groups merely because it's th e 
J nternet. For one, the photos 
may be doctored o r stolen from 
another Web site. Also, the photos 
may not be of abortions. Perhaps 
the photo is a botched birth . 
Perhaps the child has suffered a rare 
and horrific genetic defect. Perhaps 
the pictures were taken at a black 
market abortion in a Third World 
country. Perhaps the photo is years 
old, showing procedures long out-
dated and overly messy. 

Regard less of the possibi lities, 
there is no reason to believe, at first 
glance, that these picrures are 
exa ctly what the pro-life groups say 
they are. And beca use they have 
already deceived us intu viewing 
their Web si te, why should we 
believe them? 

Hoping that there would be a way 
to stop this woe, r went searchi ng tllC 
unconscionably dull copyright laws 
to see if any laws had been broken, 
both by pomography rings and pro-
life groups. Internet copyright laws 
arc ridiculously nebulous, making it 
difficult to get a grasp on what yOll 
can and can't do. 

Rut there seems to be 
one rule tllat most of 
the Internet copy-
right specia lists 
agree on : URLs 
are not copyright 
protection. As 
"rrp:ll1/Tluw.,ydi.r -
li.if. coml illffr-
lIet .bt1ll, a site 
with informa -
tion about 
internet copy-
right law, says, 
"URLs to Web 
sites arc not 
under copyright 
protection by 
themselves because 
they are a fact, just as 
telephone 11l11l1bcrs 
are." Therefore, no 
URL is offlimit s to the fir I 
party to register it. Porn rings 
and pro-life groups havc every 
right to trip Internet users into 
stumbling o nto theIr \ Veh sites . 
URL deception u~es 011 r freedom 
(not to mention inability to type) 
against us. I helieve tllat it is ullcth-

ical. Sadly, it is also unavoidable. 
Any attempt of the government 

to regulate this would just flood the 
courts with frivolous lawsuits by 
frivolous people. People would 
soon be eopyrighting letters of the 
alphabet in their URLs. 
Unfortunately, nothing more may 
be done legally except to make 
Internet users aware of these orga-
nizations. 

All organizations, from porno 
rings to pro-life crusaders, should 
count this son of activity as ethical-
ly repr-ehensible. But until it can be 
proven that these morally negli-
gent groups have done something 
illegal, we had 
all better learn 
how to 
type.

End suicide's misguided stigmas Students must examine 
UCSD's corporate ties 

speak up, 'j--
speak ~)tJ;a 

, .. . ;. 

Slllude touchcs us all al some 
po lilt in our lives. 

It was while I was rock climb-
ing in Creat Falls Natiunal Park 
in Virgi nia this summer that I 
s tumbled upon a suicide note. 

The note was written o n a 
slippery boulder no more than 15 
feet from the d rop-off into the 
Great Fa ll s. T he words of the 
sui ci de notc we re written in ,I 
!lowing ri ver of metallic dark 
red. Not written in a marker, 
possi bly in paint , but possibly in 
bloud. 

The note rcads like a poem, 
bllt there is no doubt that the 
author of this declaration was 
seriously contemplating suic ide 
and begging one last time for 
help before stepping off that 
ledge. 

l ' hc note was signed with o nly 
the initial "J." No other contact 
information was provided, just 
that mocking J . That is what upset 
me the most after reading the di s-
tn:ssi n!{ letter: J couldn't answer 
J's uy- for help because I didn 't 
IUlow who he or she was. 

Did you go through with it, J? 
Did yuu take that fatal step over 
the falls? I pray you didn't . 

Jesse Reynolds, a Great Falls 
park ra nger, said that there have 
been no sui cides this year, but that 
there is an average of one suicide 
per year. Reynulds sa id he was 
unawa re of any such suicide note 
ncar the location J described. 

T here is ho pe that J changed 
his ur her mimi and didn't go 
thruugh with it, because there 
hasn'l been a suicide this year and 
the letter was probab ly written 
recently. 

Statistically speaking, if J is a 
male, hc is lllOSt likely dead . 

Accord ing to the ' Centers for 
Di sease Contrul, males threaten 
suicide bs but go through with it 
fouf times morc fre quently than 
fe l1l ales. III 1999, males acco unted 
for 72 percent of all suicides . 

But if J is :1 female, there IS a 
ve ry hi gh probability Ihat she is 
still .dive. \Nomen :I rc statistica lly 
less likely to acntally go through 
with suicide than males, but more 
likely to attemp t it. 

According to the statistics fi"Oll1 
the American Associari on ur 
Suicidolo!:,'Y (/\/\5), a person takes 
his or her own life every 18 mjnutes. 

In other words, srnce [ bega n 
writing this colull1n 54 minutcs 
ago, three people have committed 
suicide. 

A m orbid and sobering 
though t, but true nonethel ess. 
And the world needs more of that: 
more discussion of the unpleasant 
and examination 'of the harsh rea l-
ity of suicide. 

We must get beyond the 
socially-constructed stigma of 
shame that is so often associated 
with suicide . 

We must get beyond 
the socially-

constructed stigma of 
shame that is so often 

associated with 
suicide. 

Suicide is more comm o n than 
homicide. According to the MS, 
suicide o utranks homicide bv a 
ratio of five to three. The fiAS 
also estimates that over five mil -
lion people have attempted sui-
cide, and almost everyone has had 
thoughts of suicide at some time 
in their lives. 

Face th e facts: It is impossible 
to assign a stigma to suicide with-
o ut bringing the stigma of 
hypocrisy to us all. 

But the question of what drives 
someone to suicide has haunted 
me since I stumbled ove r J 's sui-
cide letter. 

The Web site of the National 
Institute of Mental Health offers a 
wide range of reasons tha t serve as 
triggers for those considering sui -
cide, including hopelessness, pain 
and the inabi li ty to cope with a 
recem stressful experience and to 
see alternative solutions to their 
problems .

UCS D, sai d thai students ron-
templa tc suicide fur a var iet)" of 
rcasons. 

"Sollie mi ght suffer from 
chrunic depression," j\ 1ashman 
said. "Or it coultl be an event, 
sllCh as the loss of a boyfriend or 
girlfriend o r academic failure. " 

There arc somc warning signs 
to watch for in a troubled fnend 
or lcqll3in tance. 

The Sa maritans, a cris is inter-
vention Web site , lists sO ll1e 
ambiguous verbal behavior that 
can point to possi ble suicidal 
thoughts ancl actions: "I want to 
go to sleep and never wake up;" 
" I'm going away on a really long 
trip;" "You won't have to worry 
about me anymore;" "I'm so 
depressed, I can't go on;" and 
"Voices are telling me to do bad 
things." 

So what do you do if someone 
you know shows some of these 
signs or demonstrates other suici-
dal behavior? 

Listen. Be there. D o n't judge. 
Be encouraging. Then offer to go 
with them to psychological and 
cou nseling services, located in 
Galbraith H all, or have them (:III 
(858) 534-3755 to se t lip an 
appointment. Or have them call 
the anonym ous 24-hour San 
Diego crisis line at (800) 479-
3339. 

No matter how scary it Imty 
seem to vocalize the word "sui-
cide," it is imperative to break the 
shackJes of si lence and to get help. 

Suicide affects more than one 
person. Without a doubt, the life 
of that one perso n matters 
immensely to his or her family, 
friends and acquaintances, and 
even to strangers who might hap-
pen to snllnbl e on th e tra gic histo-
ry of someone they never even 
knew. 

Thi s is for you, J. T hank you 
for opening my"eyes to the world 
of pai n and da rkness that those 
battling with thoughts of suicide 
constalllly endure. 

I dcsper a tely hope YO Il found 
that foothold of comfort in the 
rocks before jumping from that 
ledge . If not, then may you rest in 
peace.

young adults to the Friday races, 

The campaign to raise attendance and draw 
in a younger market has proved successful. 

"There has been an increase of 15,000 to 
20,000 for the races on Friday," Rubenstein said, 
"\Nc.: arc very happy," 

Rhodes said tim the 4 o'clock Friday racing 
:1I1d concerts hooks an entire generation that 
would never have 3nended what she claims is an 
inhumane sport. 

"rr'~ sad to have to trick the young people co 
come to the races they would never before have 
frequented, if not for the free concert," Rhodes 
said. 

ousl y injured," Rhodes said, 
"Racehorses arc forced to race with bairlillc 
fractmes that would, without drugs, be too 
painful to TUII on. As ,I result, injuries, chronic 
lameness and fatalities are common," 

Rhodes cited a 1993 University of Minnesota 
snldy that found that 840 horses were fatally 
injured on U,S. tracks, and 3,566 horses - or 
one horse in every 22 faCes - were so severely 
injured that tht:y cOl~d not finish the race. 

Martha Gillson, a DMTC Clistomer service 
1I131Jager, said she couldn'r release information 
on whether there were any injuries to the hors-
es on the Aug. 9, r3ces, 

The racetrack allows anyone 18 years or 
older to bet 011 the races, so 1ll3ny sntdenrs place 
bets before the concerts start. 

UC Berkeley jWlior Yaniv Alfusy, a DMTC 
s;w.tomc.:r service representative, said that gam-
bling at the racetrack is attnctive for m:my rca-
sons. 

"Many shldents gamble becau$e it's risky 
nnd fun," Alfasy said . "And unlike at casinos,

Coronado is not .\Ctual ly an island hilt :l 
pcninsula, which - de~pite enorll1ous pres-
s ur~ to l1lt:rge With San Diego - has pre-
scrl"cd its independence , The tirst inhabi-
[:IIHS of Coronado were mosr li kely the San 
Diegll ilOs: Asians who crossed the Bering 
land bridgc . Their successors, the Deiguc 
Indialls, were ,till in residence 011 the island 
whell the Spanish arrived in 1542 . Ilowcver, 
cIJlI1l11erci.i1 developll1ent on Coronado did 
not happen untililluch later. 

III 1846, Spmish settler Juan Rodr'guez 
Cabrillu sold the peninsula to two Americans 

~()r $1,000. Ont: year later, when California 
became parr of the United States, the penin-
sula changed hands several times before the 
Coronado Beach Company bought it ill 
I H8r, ,lI1d began construction of the Hotel 
Del Curonado at the turn of the century. 

The Ilotel Del , as it's known, is perhaps 
the most recogni7,able attraction on 
Coronado Island. On its beach and within 
it rOOI11S, Ron:i1d Re:lgan vacationed and, at 
the hotel, -ri.ll1Y Curtis filmed "Some Like it 
I lot." John D. Spreckics, who owned one-
third of the Coronado Beach Company, 
took uver the horel when its builder was 
lInable to repay :I loan. The mansion tha t 
Spreckles huilt for himself is now the 
Glurictta Bay Inn . 

The guest that won't leave 
Kate Morgan, shown here, is said 
to have haunted the hotel since 
1892. Morgan checked into the 
hOlel nursing a broken heart 
after a quarrel with her estranged 
husband, Five days later she was 
found on the beach, dead, with 
a gunshot wound to the head. 
Her death was ruled a suicide.

Beauty and the beach: Marylin Monroe 
poses in front of the Del. 

T he Ilotcl Del has grown consi dera bly 
over the years. The Vi ctorian building that 
was the backdrop for "Somc like it I lot" is 
sti ll available for guests, and olle of th e 
rooms is even said to he h:lullted (see 'rhe 
guest that won't leave ' below), The rowers, 
cabanas, beach houses and cottages reflect 
the hotel's modernization anti expansiun . 

Dinner cruises, harbor lOurs and trolle y 
tours arc just sOll1e of the ways to explore 
Coronado. Or maybe yuu 'd like to coast 
down Orange Avenu c, the town's main drag, 
on a bicycle built for two. \ Vhile Coronado 
borders on the touristy side, when you look 
across the bay at the San Diego skyline, you 
will be gl:Jd that :111 escape from the daily 
b'l'ind is just a bridge away,

Experts warn students of

utes, at a racetrack you have four 
o r five hour s to spend your 
money." 

Keith \" 'h yte, the executive 
director of the.: National Council 
on Problem Gambling, said that 
college stude nts arc particularly 
vu lnerable to ga mbling addiction. 

"The pro blem with adoles-
cents and young adu lts is tha t 
they don't ha ve full y-evolved 

ration~ 1 decision -making skills," 
Whyte said . " A~ a res ult, the 
highest rate o f gambling prob-
lems, such as addiction , is found 
in the age group between 18 to 
21." 

Whyre said that if the race-
tracks are active ly targeting the 
young adult age group through 
free music concens, they should 
also provide gambling addiction 
prevention services. 

"Our organization remains neu-
tral on gambling; however, to be 
responsible, the racetracks must 
have a prevention program target-
ed at the very age group they've 
targeted," Whyre said . 

Nevertheless, co llege srudents 
have been comi ng out to where 
"the surf meets the turf' at old Del 
Mar. SOlli c Youth , The Vines and 
The Violent Femmes are just some 
of the bands that will have played 
Del Mar this racing season, prov-
ing that horserncing makes strange 
bedfellows.

UCSD senior lifting his dreams 
Phillip Truong trains to qualify for Olympics 
By ANU KUMAR 
Sports Editor 

UC:SD senior Phillip Truong 
had a vision and set a goa l for him-
self in high school. Since that 
point, he has been working virtual-
ly every day toward accomplishing 
his g-oal. One day, Tr'uong hopes he 
will f!o "all the way" and will quali-
fy for the Olympic weightlifting 
events. 

' Ii'uong beg-an strcngthening in 
high school to improve his basket-
ball ~a tlle . Whcn the basketball 
se~tSO;l ended, his c03ch in Van 
Nuys, Calif., saw ta lent in Truong 
and asked him to continue 
weightlifting and compete. 

His coach was right - Truong 
does have talent in the sport. At the 
Junior ationals in 1999, Truong 
finished in fifth place; the athlete 
who took first place competed in 
the Olympics. As a junior, Truong 
was nationally ranked 23rd in his 
weight cb ss from u pool of over 
JOllliftcr . 

Olympic welghtli fting includes 
two events. The snatch, the tirst 
of the rwo li fts performed in all 
Olymptc weightlifting competi -
tiuns, is a techni4uc in which the 
li fter takes a wide grip on a barbell 
and attempts to raise it above his 
head. In the clean and jerk, the

second of the two events, the Ii ft er 
l ifts the barbell to his shoulders 
and, after a pause, above his head. 

Truong is capable of lifting t 20 
kilograms in the snatch and ubom 
t 50 kilograms in the clean and jerk. 
The lifter to win the last Oly1t1pic 
weighdifting compctition in 

1 h lOng's same weight class accol11-
pli shed 160 kilogram, ill the snatch 
and 187 ki lograms in the clean amI 
jerk. 

With his uaining techniquc, 
which he hones in the weight 1'00111 
at RL\1AC six days a week for 
about three hours a day, Truong 
believes he can improvc to lift 10 
more kilograms per year in cach 
technique. H owever, keeping up 
with the stud}'ing for his psycholo-
gy major prevents lhtong from 
carrying Out his ide:tl training regi-
men. 

U ['m bearing up my body," he 
said. " Lifting at the weight 1'00 111 
ami then studying, I rarely sleep 
before 2 :I.m. That's not good for 
:Inv kind of athlete." 

' Injuri es have also slowed the 
pace of Truong's progress. lIe is 
currently hindered by wri ,[ and 
back injuries, which he sustai ned in 
training. 

Truong- emphasizes that 
weightlifting should he used as a 
me:lns of tra ining for all sports. 

" Weightlifting has always hccn 
misconstrued for body building or 
power lifting," Truong said . 
"They differ in that both do not 
involve any type of ovcrt skill. 

" 'vVith wcighrlifting, YOll need 
speed, agility, tlexibility and overall 
:1thleticisl1l . \Vith wcightlifting, 
there is maximal output froll1 the 
nervous system as well as the mus-
cular system, whereas the other 
two are minimal. I could go on and

Points: 
UCSD should have ath-

wondered ~hen, if ever, there 
would he things to represent 
UCSD in stores other than the 
bookstore in the Price Center. 

There is an obvious difference 
between schools such as UC 
Berkeley and UCSD; they compete 
in Division I. 

UCSD, the only university in 
Division II not to hand out athletic 
schularships, is able to take pride in 
its impressive raw athletic talent 

after tak.ing third place in the 2002 
Sears Directors' Cup. 

UCSD could have won the 
Directors' Cup, but it still wouldn't 
attract the attention of more than a 
handful of people. There needs to 
be something that grabs people's 
anention, but there won't be such a 
focal point until UCSD starts 
granting 5Cholarships to student 
athletes. 

The lrilOllS recently made the 
jump from Division III to Division 
II, and UCSD convincingly proved 
itself to be the third-best 5Chool in 
the nation at the more competitive 
level. Shouldn't that be some 
incentive to the athletics depart-
ment to think about giving athletic 
scholarships? 

weightlifring as a part of training 
for a II sportS." 

-lI'uong plans to cominue with 
his workout rourine throughom his 
final year at UCSD in order to 
qualify for the next natiunal COI11-
petition . After graduating next 
June, this Olympic hopeful will go 
b'1Ck and train with his coach, after 
which he would like to work Out at 
the Olympic.: training center in 
Colorado Springs. 

"I would like to train there with 
other Olympians and then hopeful-
ly go all the way," Truong said. 

Such a move would soon allow 
UCSD to draw attention from 
across the cOl1ntry, and scholar-
ships could help the Tritons com-
pete with nationally known univer-
sities. 

For now, UCSD will have to 
force itself to be content with what 
it has. The Tritons will have to 
force themselves to be satisfied and 
excited about a Spirit Night against 
our not-much-of-a-rival UC Davis. 

It seems like a world of differ-
ence would eome about if UCSD 
athletes could earn scholarships. 

The lritons might continue to 
rack lip Sears Directors' Cup 

poitlt~ and improve their impres-
sive Division II records, while 
UCSD is left off the map,
