the eleclricity in the room fails, leaving 
only darkness. The year 2000 bug has 
left some people worried that thi may 
be an accurate forecasl of the future. 

The year 2000 bug is a problem 
because many older computer programs 
and chips were built lo assume that the 
firsl two digit s in a c ntury are always 
" 19." When the lim day of the new mil-
lennium comes around, many computer 
will think il is Jan. I, 1900.

a recent report from the Federal General 
Accounling Office warned that if lhe

ning. 

Hamburg, a former democralic .S.

cies or non-violence should go beyond gun 
control. He sa id lhat in a Idition to hanning 
weapons for cili/ens, we should pursue a 
policy of non-violence III foreign affairs . 

"The atmosphere of violence start s al lhe 
top,' Hamburg said. 

The only woman among seven candi-
dates in her race, mir is an environmental 
scientist with the Departlllent of Toxic 
Substances Conlrol She said she is espe-
cially interested in issues concerning the 
environmcnt. 

Amir said thal there i ' a direct connec-
tion bet ween cancer and pollution. 

"One th()u~and five hundred people die 
every day from cancer in thi s country," she 
said. "Eighly percent of all cancers arc 
caused by environmental toxins." 

Amir said that the stale needs to invest in 
alternative renewable energy sources. She 
added thal while scientists suggest lhal we 
should cut fos1> il fuel emiSSIOns hy 60 per-
cent, accompli hing the lask would involve 
a large alllounl of time and dedication. 

"We would have to pUl the degree of 
effort behind thal , that we put inlo making 
the alom bomb," Amir said. 

Hamburg and Amir also discu '1>ed

Tritons Shine Despite 
Lack of a Football Team 

Last weekend, Homecoming 1998 proved that 
UCSD can radiate spirit despite the lack of a tradi-
ti onal homecoming foothall game. Alumni , slUdents, 
staff, faculty and even commu nity members showed 
the ir support for UCSD at the Chance ll or's 
Challenge 5K RunlWalk. which kicked off the week-
end festi vities and raised over $ 100,000 for under-
graduate scholarships. Thank you, Chan e ll or Dynes, 
for starting this tradition that not onl y unites the 
UCSD community, past and prescnt , bUl raises 
money for such a worthy cause. 

The weeke nd 's ce lebrati o n also included the 
awarding of the Sears Directors' Cup, a trophy g iven 
to the bes t athletic program in each of the collegiate 
divi sions. U D is the firs t school ever to win the 
Sears Cup without a football team. o ngratulations 
to the Triton athletic program for making sport s his-
tory and re e i ving well-deserved recognition for a ll 
the ir hard work and ta lent. 

For such a young school . UCSD is fortunate that 
so many alumni carne back to support their alma 
mater. We appreciate the efforts of everyone who put 
in the time and work to make Homecoming 1998 a 
success. Also, thank you A.S. President Joe 
Leventhal for finishing ahead of the chancellor in the 
5K and thereby winning a free barbecue on Library 
Walk for a ll students next quarter! 

Education Act Expects 
Parental Responsibility 

President Clinton s igned the Higher Education Act 
on Oct. 7 , giving universities the authority to notify 
parents of a student's drug and alcohol violations. 
Meaning, if a co llege student under the age of 21 is 
cllught drinking or doing drugs, college administra-
lOrs have every right to tell the student's parents. 

This legislati on is absurd. Under the law, being 18-
years-old means you are an adult, regardl rss o f 
whether you are in college. Part of being a respons i-
ble adult is taking responsibi lity for your actions. 

By passing this law, Congress is effecti ve ly saying 
that college students are not really capable of moni -
toring their own behavior and must be periodically 
re igned in by their pan.:nts. This hurts both parents 
and students. 

Parents don 'l need the added worry of caring for 
their grown-up chi ldren, and college students need a 
hance to fend for themselves before entering the 

"real wor ld ." How can sludents t:ver be expected to 
be fully functioning adults if they arc nol treated so 
under the law? 

ollege should be a time to test out adulthood in a 
safe environment, not an ex te nsion of high school. 
Despite the bill's good intention of protec ting co ll ege 
students, the Higher Education Act will ultimate ly 
prevent parents from letting go and students from 
testing out their wings . 

Props and Flops 
Props to Ht:a lth cicnces for reducing thc 

number of faculty mcmber responsibilitics, bal-
ancing its re~ourccs and improving education. 

Props to Kiki Smith's fountain , the lIewc~t 
addition to the Stuart Collection. The co llection 
as a whole is, however, sti ll quite appalling.

CULTURAL ICON RIGHTFULLY 
RETURNS TO SPACE AT AGE 77 
COMMENTARY: 
Hero 's ability to 
contribute to Discovery 
should be celebrated 
By Laura Knighten 
Senior Staff Writer 

Heroes are a ~ommodit y that 
America runs short of th cst: days. With 
our pres ident under constant attack 
and lilll' and spons star ' frequcntly 
under arrest , it is difficult to imagine 
what Sen. John Glenn meant to the cit-
izens of this country 36 years ago. 

Yet, a hero is exactl y what John 
Glenn was to ou r parents and grand-
parents in 1962. During an astonishing 
five· hour night aboard Friendship 7, 
Glenn became the lirst Illcrican, and 

~ecoml human, to orhit the: earth. He 
fueled Ameril:an dreams of ~pace tra\'-
d . brought ~cience - anLl NA ' A- to 
the forefront of national l"on,l:iou\-

Il\.:~~ . anLl brought a ~enM': of M:curity to 
a nation heing healen in the ~pace race 
by it, Cold War em:my, the USSR . 

Wilh thc ColLI War long over and 
Rus~ians and Amcric,\Il~ wurking hand 
in hand to fUl1her ~pace ~I:ience, 77-
ycar-old Glenn, now a sena tor from 

hio, will return to space today. This 
time he will travel in ~ t yle as the old e~t 

as t ro na~1l ever to cnter orhit. In 'teaLl of 
a so lo journey in a tiny capsule wi th 
one window anLl n com puler, Glenn 
wi ll nde in the Discovery sparc shullle, 
a sophi sti ca ted piece of machinery, 
wi th six olher crew member, . 

While many Americam cclebralt: 
Glenn's return to orbi t, thc Irip ha, 
also met with a grea t deal 01 cri ticism. 
Some charge that Glenn is not "mis-
sion criti ca l" and therefore a waste of 
taxpayer's money. while others allege 
that Glenn 's return trip comes as a 
result of an unfair use of his power as 
a senator, as well as a payback for 
Glenn's support of the Clinton admin-

Some ask if it is 
critical that these 
experiments be 
conducted now. The 
answer is no. In fact 
the information Glenn 
sends back will 
probably never 

~irectly benefit him or 
his generation. 
However, combined 
with future 
hypotheses and 
experiments, it may 
benefit ours. 
is tratlon. 

While thl!sC charges may on some 
kvel hl! truc. Glenn shou ld still be 
granted a rcturn Irip to space. 

Hc may not he an c,sential crew 
mcmber aboard Discovery, but Glenn 
wi II add a unique dimensiol1 to the trip. 
For SO I1ll! tillle, NASA ~cicnll sts have 
observed a resemblanc(' betwee n the 
effects of weightlcssnes~ on astronauts 
and thl! aging proee~s . Through hi s par-
ti cipation in 10 physical cltperiments, 
Glenn will work to help sc ientists dis-

cover any co nnection that ex ists 
between the aging process and the 
force of gravity upon human beings. 

Glenn's role in these ex periments 
requires that he wear a "sleep harness" 
full of electrodes (vaguely reminiscent 
of head gear, for those readers who 
experienced the joy of braces) and a 
heart monitor, as well as swatlow a pill 
reported to be roughly the size of a bot-
li e cap. The pill will contain a ther-
mometer and transmiller that will 
record Glenn's body temperature on a 
regular basis. Because Glenn is fit 
enough 10 meet NASA standards at age 
77, he will add the dimension of geri-
atric study to the mission that other 
astronauts could not. Clearl y, he docs 
add va lue to the Discovery mission . 

Glcnn\ ,ervice a\ a guinea pig for 
thesc expcriment> will help the ,cil!n-
ti fic and medi cal community learn 
what CUI1I1L:ctiol1 lies between thl! lorce 
of gravity and the agi ng proct:ss in 
human hcing~. An y knowledge about 
aging gleaned from the mission, and 
any other experiments thai may result 
from Glenn's work, will eventually 
help improve Ihe quality of life of the 
nation's elderly, perhaps even lead to 
technology that may reverse some eh:-
ments of the aging process. 

Some ask if it is criti cal that these 
experiments be conducted now. The 
answer is no. [n fact the information 
Glenn ends back wi II probably ncver 
directly benefit 111m or hi s generation . 
However, combined wi th future 
hypotheses and experiments, it ma y 
benefit ours. 

Additionally, sending Glenn. a space 
veteran, may prove quite revcaling. 
NASA doctors have information on 
Glenn dating ba 'k at least four decades. 
Perhaps they will learn more than thcy 
bargained for by comparing the physi-
cal effects of . pace travel on Glenn in 
1962 with the data gathered in 1998.

NON-SCIENCE DEPARTMENTS MUST EARN LUNCH 
Editor: 

This is in response to the edito-
rial entitled "UCSD Must Excel in 
All Departments to Compete," 
published in the Guardian on Oct. 
22. A concept apparently not 
understood hy the aut hor is that 
there is no such Ihing us a free 
lunch. 

The School of Engincering has 
indeed recei ved very significant 
contributions over the past year. 
These were not UCSD fund s. The 
contributions were made directly to 
the School of Engineering hy inde-
pendent entiti es who stand to gain 
from ils further improvement. 
Good engineers are in high 
demand, and evidenlly the industry 
is recognizing the benefits it wi ll 
gain from investing in their educa-
tion. 

Asking for money to be magi-
cally injected into departments is 
asking for charity - a free lunch. 
There is a very important di slinc-
tion between investment and chari-
ty. In investment, both parties gain 
from the transaction, whereas char-
ity is parasitic, unearned money. 
UCSD's money being poured into 
the bottomless pits of departments 
ultimately comes out of all of our 
pockets in tuition and taxes - no 
free lunch . 

For departments to receive 
more funds . they must first better 
themselves and demonstrate that 
they have something to olTer in 
thei r respecti ve fields. These 
departments must show that they 
are a good investment lO those 

whu will benefi t from their suc-
cess, or they will be lefl in the 
dust. . 

If Ihe quality of the uni vcr,i t as 
a whole is measured by the sum of 
its parts. then it shou ld cnwurage 
all departments to follow in the 
example of Ihose who currently 
conlribute the mos t to that sum, 
sudl as the departments of engi-
neering and sciences.

Ignorance Enrages 
Real Sports Fans 
Editor: 

I would like to applaud Jacoh 
Gordon, sports editor, on hi s col-
umn " Padre Fans Aren 't Real 
Fans" (Guardian, Oct. 22. 1998). 
Not only is he wise enough to see 
through to the shallow stupidity of 
Padres fans , but he is at the same 
time able to show us how a TRUE 
and WISE American male sports 
fan should behave. 

That fan is the one who would 
say something like: "I damn near 
hit her," when a woman demon-
strates a lack of know ledge regard-
ing a sport. 

Finally there is a man not afraid 
to show his rage - rage strong 
enough to bring him to the brink of 
physical assault ' when a woman 
doesn ' t know the number of 
innings in a baseball game. 

Thank you, Jacob Gordon.

Student's Logic 
Must Be Questioned 
Editor: 

Reading the leiter ("Hate 
Crimes Are Not Our Business," 
Gllardian, Oct. 22, 1998) from Ihe 
presumably smart and modern stu· 
dent Dann Zurek last Thursdny, I 
cou ld not help but wonder nbout 
his level of logic and awareness 
when he states : "one isolated act of 
murder is not conclusive evidence 
of a nationwide epidemic of hate 
crimes." 

BY POPULAR DEMAND, 
SOLANA BEACH! 

Starting November 25th, our free holiday 
shuttles to trains for UCSD students will 
head north to the Solana Beach Amtrak 
Station (flyers, not to worry, we'll still be 
giving rides south to Lindbergh Field) 

I could nOI hop' to change the 
mind of someone like Dana Zurek, 
who wri tes abou t hi s Chri sti an 
alt ru ism and the lifestyk choice of 
homosexuab. Just as ( won't 
l:hange my mind ahout a human 
heing having their righ t to be them-
selvl!s protected hy law, people like 
Dana Zurek wi ll desperately ho ld 
on tn their bel ids ahou t a person's 
worth in relation to his or ha own 
se lf-worth. Perhaps he thinks 
Matthew Shepard chose to be mur-
dered. 

I would like to remind pe pie 
like him Ihat Ihere is one ex treme-
ly famous case of an iso lated hate 
crime that cre:lIcd far more than 
legi lation. Like Matthew 
Shepard, this person was tied to 
hand-hewn posts and murdered. 
Can you guess whose son 1 am 
talking about here" 

Maybe none of us wuuld know 
about Jesus being crucified had it 
taken place in Wyoming, in Dana 
Zurek's simple world.

Athletics Create A . 
WelHounded School 
Editor: 

The move to Division II athlet-
ics is a much needed and long over-
due step to improve the overall 
experience of UCSD. Our athletes 
have proven themselves superior at 
the Division III level and the move 
would result in more exciti ng 
matchups . Full scholarship, 

Limited 
• Watch out for drunk drivers 

Division I athletics should be the 
ultimate goal of the Triton spons 
program. 

Sports playa major part in Ihe 
lives of Ailleril!ans today. To make 
UCSD a superior. wel l-rounded 
insti tut ion. it makes sense to strive 
for excellence in all facets of life. 
Therc is no question that UCSD is 
a top-ranked academic university, 
bUI support for sports is lac king. 
One cannot necessarily blame the 
students. No team enjoys a sizable 
crowd unless the game is a nation· 
al championship. 

The faculty and administration, 
however, show even less support 
for athletics. Comments made by 
offi cials in the Guardian ("Faculty 
Approve Move to Division II In 
Mail Ballot," Oct. 19,19(8) reflect 
thi s lack of support , as [does] the 
published budget for our sports 
program. The article stated that the 
faculty was opposed to athletic 
scholarships and any increase in 
the athletic budget. UCSD has set 
aside $500,000 for sports while the 
average Division 1I school has a 
budget of $2.3 million. 

Also, how ean a student gel 
excited about a UCSD vs. ' 
Savannah College of Art and 
Design matchup? Imagine a bas-
ketball game between the Tritons 
of UCSD and the Bruins of UCLA. 
The stands would be full, the band 
playing and there would be excite· 
ment in the air. The Friday-night

Charges as to Glenn '~ use of

Diego news station reported that 
lhe head of ASA received 52 
call s from Glenn before the 
January mission annOUlll;ement.. 
Glenn. denied a second !light in 
lhe '60s bccause of hi s importance

that he wanted and did everything 
reasonable in hi s power to make it 
happen. If anything, such tenacity 
shows Glenn as a role model to 
young and old alike for determina-
tion and ambition. 

Moreover, Glenn 's hard work in 
both returning to space and in mak-
ing the trip happen prove that peo-
ple of any age can be contributing 
members of society. Glenn recent-
ly told Newsweek magazine ("The 
Time Traveler," Oct. 26, 19(8) 

thal, "I'm n t done yet.." While not 
everyone over 50 can go into 
pace, no person, no matter his or 

her age, has to be "done" after 
retirement. No maller what infor-
mation Glenn brings back in the 
mission, he exempli lies the philos-
ophy of "young at heart." 

Finally, if Glenn 's ,pot in the 
Discovery crew i~ a "pay back," it 
is one from the American people. 
In Glenn 's 1962 orbi t. he ri~ked 
hiS life to hoost the American 
position in the space race and to

to make the journey and can add 
value to the miss ion, we should 
celebrate his trip. 

Glenn, who has been training 
since February, passes NASA's 
physical requirements and has 
spent 12 hours a day in classroom 
and simulators learning how to

operate the equipment not avail-
able in his 1962 journey. While his 
trip will increase both NASA's and 
Glenn 's prominence in the 
American mind, it will also bring 
us important scientilic infonnation. 

At 2 p.m. ' ST when Glenn and 
the ~ix other crew members jour-
ney into space, let u~ wish them 
well. Glenn ha, earned hi s place 
among the crew for the work he 
already ha, done and for the infor-

stated, "'This is a very high-level

Is it impossible to have superior

would be no different than those for 
normal students. Evcr hea r of

HOMECOMING '98 SURPRISES 
COMMENTARY: 
Spirits fly at UCSD's 
suce ful, non-tradi-
tional Homecoming 
By Travis HIli 
Associate Sports Editor 

I can just hear the whimpering 
right now: 

"Wah! There's no football here I 
How can we have a Homecoming? 
Wait! I think I left my Bunsen 
burner on, gotta go! Wahhhhhhhh!" 

You know, as smart as people at 
UCSD are supposed to be, they 
really are quile stupid . 

Listen up UCSD: Homecoming 
'98 was actually pretty cool. Why'! 
Because I gave it a chance. 

For everyone crying because of 
the lack of football and subsequent-
ly the lack of a "traditional " 
Homecoming, it 's important to 
remember that Homecomi ng is a 
celebrati on of people returning 
home. So despite the fact that we 
don 't ha ve a football squad, we can 
still take pride in our extremely 
success fu lath letes of the past and 
present from other sports. 

Besides, if any of you know the 
lirst thing about me, you know that 
I am probably UCSD 's biggest pro-
pom:nt of a f(x>t ball prog ram . So 
when J heard about Homecoming, I 
just kind of shrugged it all. Then I 
heard about the detail s of the event. 
It was to be a weekend-long cele-
bration spanning every home game, 
wi th the highli ght heing a huge 
afternoon fes ti val on RIMAC field 
before and during Saturday'S mcn's 

The festivities at 
Homecoming 
included food, 
bands, booths, a 3()" 
foot Inflatable slide 
and to top It all off, 
a beer garden. 
Stili sound stupid? I 
don't think so. 
soccer game. The festiviti es at 
Homecoming included food. hands, 
booths, a 3D-foot inflatable slide 
and to top it all off. a beer garden. 

Still sound stupid? I don ' t think 
so. 

Homecoming was a damn good 
time. It was espec ially cool becausc 
men's and women's soccer, wa ter 
polo and vo lleyball programs all 
had alumni games that pitted for-
mer UC5D s lar~ agai nst the current 
ones. TllOse games were great lun. 

On Saturd ay, everyone in atten-
dance had a b la~ t.. There we re rep-
resentatives from most spo rts teams 
in allendance, as well as some stu-

dents who just showed up to see 
what wa going on. I saw alumni 
meeting people and telling them old 
war stories about how great the 
"good old days" were. As sappy as 
it sounds. it was still pretty coo l. 

I spent most of my time in the 
beer garden, probably the greatest 
invention since beer itself. ow 
I'm sure many will point to my 
being hammered as the t:ause or my 
outstanding time at Homecoming. 
Well. that delinitely contrihuted, 
but I had fun at the ther events 
when I was sober. Besides, what 
the hell is wrong with having two, 
three or 10 beers wi th some old and 
new friends? 

I met some really cool people at 
Homecoming, and found out that 
we ac tually do have a lot of tradi-
tion in our athletic program - a 
tradition that was furthered when 
UCSD received the cars 
Directors' Cup, awarded to the best 

CAA Di vision III athletic pro-
gram, during halftime of the men 's 
soccer game. That was very coo l. 

Overall , I'd have to say that 
Homecoming ' 98 was a success. It 
was hy no means traditional. hut I 
think th at's what added to the fun 
of it all. So, this is the part where I 
continue to chastise every apathetic 
sat:k at thiS schoo l. Do not cry 
ahout stull like Homecoming unt il 
you gct yo ur as~ ou t th i!re. You 
might he , urp rised and meet ,orne 
cool people. While you' re at it, he

The VCSD Guardian 

Y2K: Harel says 
UCSD has been 
preparing for 2000 
Continued from paige 1 
terns to make sure they are safe 
from year 2000 bug problems. 

"Hopefully, [the year 2000 bug] 
won't even affect UCSD students," 
he said. "There obviously may be 
some gli t(; hes here and there on 
some lillie th i ng~ that may not he 
working the fi rst d<lY of the year, 
but we are h<lving major tests being 
done on all the key (;O mpuler sys-
lems to make sure thai they are 
lesled hefore 1999." 

Hanel sa id Ihe commiltee makes 
sure thai the areas or (;a mpm, thai 
affe(; t students Ihe most arc moni-
tored for any possi ble problem~. 

"We have to d leck cenlral sys-
tems such as SludentLi nk 10 make 

~ure that all the Iyear 2000 bug] 
problems are resolved. while we 
also are working with campus 
authorities 10 make su re Ihat the 
ex tern al is~ues such as electrici ty 
and telephoncs arc goi ng III he 
working correctly," Hare l ~aid. 

Additionally. t.:heck~ wi ll be 
made on Ihe hasic equipment that 
stude nls u~e in order to make sure 
Ihe in~lrument s conlinue 10 work as 
usual. 

"AII kinds of inslruments in lab· 
oratories have 10 be tested because 

they have imbedded, pre-pro-
grammed chips in them, like med-
ical instruments or instruments in 
different chemistry and t-iological 
labs and so on ," he aid. "We need 
to test multiple risky dates when 
we do the testing, including the end 
of February. II those things are 
being tested." 

Harel also said that product ven-
dors make testing eas ier by listing 
which of their products are certi -
fied safe. However, Harcl said that 
these in~trumenl are not the main 
threal. 

"The fi rSI priority is to make 
sure the critical system~ are on and 
Ihere's no safety issues," Harel 
said . "We deli nitely don' t want ele-
vators that don' l work or tele-
phone~ Ihal don' l work or networks 
Ihat dOll ' t work or that Ihe basic 
registrali on system doesn' t work. 
Those are the Ii rst prioriti es and 
those are, as far as I know, all taken 
care of. But there's still more work 
10 be done before 1999. There' 

~Iill a lot of tesling Ihat's bei ng 
done." 

Harel also said that all of the 
lesting and adj usting has required 

u niver~i t y mo ney. 
"We have cenlra ll y spent about 

500,000 so far on [year 2000 bug] 
lesting." Harel said. "This includes 
purchasc or lesling soft ware and 
lahor costs." 

Harel said that UCSD actually 

Thursday, October 29, 1998 

has not needed to spend as much 
money as some of the other cam-
puse.s preparing for the year 2000 
bug becau e UCSD is a younger 
campus than most schools, so it s 
core systems are relatively mod-
ern . 

"We are in very good hape, pri-
marily because we are a relatively 
young campus so our central com-
puting systems are not very old," 
Harel said. "Some campuses have 
financial systems or student sys-
tems that dale back to Ihe I 960s or 
19705. We don' t have anything like 
thaI. Our oldest systems arc from 
1991 so we don't reall y have any 
old systems that didn' l lake any of 
Ihi s [the year 2000 bug] inlO 
account. 

"The bOllom line is thai it's a 
seri ous issue, but we think we arc 
in good shape," Harel said .

BEFORE THESE CROWDED SEATS 
Dave Matthews Band charges Coors Amphitheater with energy and emotion 
By Vikrum J, Singh 
Guardian Reporter 

On Monday night. Oct. 26, the

provided an evening of inlense pas-
sion. Ireedom and a~t oni shment

onto the stage . 
" R ap un ze l ," 
"Slay," H rush" 
and "Don ' t Drink 

their Cra.l'll the Water" each 
provided a taste of Dave's new 
musical dynamic. "Rapunze l," in 
particular. was one of the live lie t 
songs. It featured a whirling solo 
hy Moore and Stefan Lessard 
(bassist). Drumming prodigy 
Carter Beauford also engaged the 
audience with hi s phenomenal abil-
ities . Matthews rambunctiously 
clicked his hee ls and spun like a 
dervish, while Moore and Beauford 
exchanged music _

album . Gnl(;efully waltzing 01110 
the stage at Coors Amphilheater in 
his ever-so- popularized lounge 
pants, Dave Matthew ' gave a per-
formance thai will leave San Die-
gans bedazzled for months to 
come. Band members Boyd Tinsley 
(acousti c violin) and Leroi Moore 
(saxophones, flule and bass <.:Iar-
inel) each played a so lo set within 
this opening song that energized 
the audience and set the pace for 
the rest of the ni ght. The group 
played a fast paced improvisation 
and ended abruptly, creating an 
inviting and powerful atmosphere. 

Dave stayed close to his tradi -
tional roots for most of the concert , 
playing "Best of What's Around," 
'Two Step" and " Warehouse," 
among others_ Each song included 
an improvisati onal jam session by 
the band and electric ri lIs and solos 
from Tim Rey nolds (e lectric guitar) 
and Greg Howard (chapman sti<.:k) . 
Reynolds carried eat:h song into a 
new dimension, showi ng the audi-

"Ants Marching" was one of Ihe 
most powerful songs o f the 
evening. All the performers played 
ind ividual so los and caused an 
uncontrollable response from the 
audience. Tinsley, however, stoic 
the show. He stepped up 10 the very 
edge of the stage and began a th ree· 
minute improvisational violin solo. 
Inflated condoms were fl ying, 
lights were flashi ng and fans were 
screa ming, but Boyd continued 
faster and faster, hypnoti call y 
up lifting the audience to a natural 
high. 

Dave Lubiu/ Guordlon 
Matthews: Dave Matthews plays for over 12,000 who attended Monday night at the Coors 
Ampitheate, finishing the band 's two hour set with" All Along the Watchtower." 

Like mo 't of its concerts, the 
Dave Matlhews Band loves to end 
with Ihe old Bob Dy lan hit "All 
Along the Watchtower." In keeping 
with tradition , the band did just 
that. Boyd fiddled with his violin. 
creating a sound reminiscent of 
antique Asian strings. while 
Reynolds scratched the strings of 
his guitar, creating a psychede li c 

effect. Both sounds fu sed together 
incredibly we ll , facililating the 
intense passion wi th whi ch 
Matthews was about to sing. Clos-
ing his eyes and crisply striking his 
Chet Atkin 's signature series guitar, 
Dave exploded on the microphone 
while the olher instruments came in 
around him. The power and magni-
tude of this last song is simply 

indescribable. 
At 10:45, two and a half hours 

after it started play ing, the band left 
the stage and fans re luctantly 
crawled out of the amphitheater 
still mesmerized_ A Live at Coors 
Alllphitheater CD mighl be an 
appropriate project , after all the 
energy the band left wilh the audio 
ence.

SCARY MONSTERS 
SUPER CREEPS 
R ,m,m"', who. H.llow,," 
was all about candy? It was simply a 
malter of choosing the right hero or 
vill ain , buying or fas hioning the 
appropri ate cOSlume, procuring a bag 
or a bucket and a Il ashlight. and hit-
ting Ihe streets wi th friends to 
'crounge up a month 's worth of candy 
in only a few short hours. 

The celebration of Hallowecn was 
a happy ritual of go rging one's se lf on 
sweets until eve ry las t ounce of sugar 
was consumed. or until Mom put a 
stop to il and insisted that toothhrush-
ing was next on the age nda. 

Sadly. unless yo u're still under 5 
feet tall . those days arc gone forever. 
In the process of growing up, the ce l-
ebration of Halloween has changed 
from an innocent gathering of candy 
bars into a yearl y challenge to test the 
limits of your fear. 

Some !lock to amusement parks 
that feature a Halloween Iheme and a 
colleclion of well -constructed "ter-
rors" fo r their dose of fri ght. while 
olhers search for local "haunted hous-
es" which have been set up to capital-
ize on the season. Others. looking for 
an excuse to party, wind up scaring 
themselves by binge drinking to the 
point of hospitali luti on. 

These acti vities. whi le being exci t-
ing as wcll as delrimental to the blood 
pressu re, can rapidl y grow tiresome to 
the twenty-somelh ing coll ege stu-
dents who have had enough of the 
routine of the Hall oween sem,on. 

This year, put the candy for Ihe 
neighhors' kids outside, tu rn out the 
lights and scare the bejeepers out of 
yourself with a scary movie. 
The Classic Horror 

"Halloween" (1978) 
This classic is "I he" origi nal hor-

ror li hn. Already 20-ycars-old, this 
slasher horror movie set the Mandards 
that arc sti II being observed by w n-
temporary horror fi lmmakers . 
Direc ted by the infa mous John 
Carpenter and starring Jamie Lee 
Curt is. Ihe fil m wa~ made on a low 
budget. Despi te its age, il SI i II man-
ages to play on very modern fears. 

"Friday the 13th" ( 1980) and "A 
Nighlmare on Elm Street" (1984) 

As the movie says . "Whalever you 
do, don' t fall asleep:' This pair of 
classics should be checked olT from 
every scary-movie lover's lis!. These 
films helped to establish the mass-
murdering psycho genre. Their subse· 
quent sequels (a long with the 
"Halloween" sequels) have generated 

If you're sick of the spooks that haunt those 
scary freshman parties, why not check out 

the imaginated variety on film1 
franchises that still ex ist today. "Elm 
Street" also brought direclor Wes 
Craven into the spotl ight. 

"Polterge ist" (1982) 
Steven Spielberg's story of a house 

haunted by lost soul s puts a far-less 
bloody sp in on the conventions of a 
horror movie. The plot is consider-
ably richer than others of its lime and 
presents situations that are more fam-
il y-orient ed th at it s contcmporaries. 
Despite its depth, the tension and the 
terro r remai n. 
Psychological Thrillers 

" Psycho" (1960) 
Direc tor Al fred Hitchcock's best-

kn ow n wo rk is a mas terpi cce of 
American cinema and a milestone in 
the thrill er/horror genre. The story of 
a young woman stealing from her 
employer in the hopes of slaning a 
new life takes a shocking twist when 
she stops to spend the night at the 
Bates MOlel. The artistry of thi s fi lm 's 
music, . framing and editing 
arc almos t as enjoyable 
as lht: plot itse lf. 

"The Shin ing" 
( 1980) 

Stanl ey Kubrick 
brings Steven King's 
~ t o ry of cabi n feve r 
gone mad to the big 
screen. Jack 

icholson', per-
formance of the

fi nest work. The 
director brings his 
uni que slyle to 
the fi lm as well , 
addi ng to mood 
and style of lh is 
cxce llent pi cturc. 

" Rose mary's 
Baby"' (1968) 

While lhe lill e 
doesn' t hint at the hor-
ror genre, this Ii 1m is 
arg uably the ultimate 
horror movie -
even the video 
cover suggests ev il 

incamate. Roman Polnn,ki directs an 
exce llent cast headed up by the bri 1-
lianl Mi a Farrow a~ Rosemary. The 
li lm is based on the gu thi c novel by 
writer Ira Lev in . 

"The Ex orcist" (1973) 
Despite a lack 111 wel l-known

Exorcist is a classic , lory of demon

horror genre with some fresh blood 
by developing a new story rather than 
another sequel. The resull was Ihe

Kevin Williamson tried to write 
himself another winner with "Last 
Summer: ' However. it takes more 
than attracti ve ac tors and actresses to 
create an engaging storyline, and the 
series h a~ suffered as a result. Th is 
lilm has received far less acclaim than 
the Scream series due to its weak plot 
and poor development.

HALLOWEEN WITH A LATIN ACCENT 
La Jolla Symphony and Chorus will premiere 'Latin Accent' this Halloween 
By Laura Brommelsiek 
Guardian Reporter 

Thi~ Halloween, while children 
beg neighbors for candy, and la~ t 
minute alterations arc made on 
costumes, over 220 of CSD and 
La Joll a's linest musica l and voca l 
talents will tunc thei r instrument~ 

works." Soli berger said. 
Cha e concludes the perfor-

Illan(;e with the west coast pre-
miere of "Ode to Common 
Things," ba~ed on the te)( ts of 

obel Prize-winning Chilean poet 
Pablo Neruda. eruda explores the 
(;ommon things we take fo r grant -

and warm up 
their voices for 
the La 10lla 

ymphony and 
Choru~ 
(LJS&C)1998-

//J co~cert ~ 
',eVteW 

ed: the feel and 
fum:t ion of an 
object, the l. lm-
plistic sensation~ 
that we ~o fre-

99 season premiere. "Latin 
Accenl." . 

The performances thi s Saturday 
and Sunday will open LJS& 's 
44th season, "Passport to the 
World." Veteran Choral DircclOr 
David Chase and newly appointed 
Music Director Harvey Sollberger 
lead the group on thi s year's jour-
ney. 

Thi~ sea~o n i~ a ce lebration of 
Latin and Far East musical tri -
umphs, with Rus~ian, European 
and American empha~is . "Latin 
Accent" commences with "Rap-
sodie Espagnol," a four-movement 
piece the brochure ca lls a "sultry 
homage to Spain." Sollberger 
described this piece as a slow tran-
sition from the 'deep "Prelude to the 
Night ," a shadowy movement. to 
the astounding conclusion in 
"Feria." 

'''Feria' is explosive. The literal 
definition equivocates to celebra-
tion, like our street fairs and mar-
ketplaces. Its finale brings on lire-

quently overlook 
in our everyday li ves. 

While it may be too late for 
many people interested in the con-
(;ert to allend. the whole concept 
of LlS& ~hould be enough to 
bring interested parties to future 
shows. Nearly hal I' of the ense m-
ble are UCSD student s, be they 
undergraduates or dedi (;u ted 
music majors. The other half arc 
wmmunity members from around 
the San Diego area, even as far as 
Orange ounty, ranging in age 
from high school s tudents to 
senior ci ti zens. 

One thing the performers all 
share, however, is their love of 
music. 

"Professional musicians can 
get burnt out from the constant 
performances ... they may sturt to 
lose the very quality that brought 
them to music in the first place," 
Sollberger stated. "Having only 
volunteers makes the gro up ahout 
enjoyment and keeps David 
[Chase) and myself honest. We 

must meet and surpass the e)(pec -
tations these mu,idans bring to 
rehearsals and performances, or 
else they wi ll go and play for 
someone e l ~e ." 

• ollberger has been a profe ssor 
of music at CSD since 1992, 
teaching cour~es in conducting and 
a large undergraduate course called 
"The Symphony." (It '> Musi(; 9 for 
those interested.) 

He i~ a fluti st, symphonic con-
du(;tor, composer and teacher all in 
one. When asked how he keeps 
eve rything hal anced, Sollbcrger 
said that every activity feeds off the 
others, raising the energy and con-
centration Icvd\ needed to perform 
eac h ta~k . 

La Joll a Symphony and Chorus 
is considered one of the few "true" 
symphony and c ho rtl ~ associations. 
While many symphoni es have a 
chorus they will ca lion when in 
need, the LJS&C conglomerati on 
gives both groups equal partner-
ship. 

US&C performs on campus in 
the Mandeville Auditorium. Each 
quarter, there is one weekend of 
performances consist ing of a Satur-
day night presentation at 8 p.m . and 
Sunday matinee at 3 p.m. In addi-
tion, anyone can come to the linal 
dress rehearsal from 7 to 10 p.m. 
on the Friday before the show for a 
mere $3 . Generally, for the benelit 
of the audience, the music director 
will give a conci se synopsis of the 
performan(;e before the rehrarsal 
begins. 

Courtesy of La Jolla Symphony 
SoUbargar: Harvey Sollberger will be making his debut as the newly 
appointed music director at "Latin Accent" 

Eric Br mberger, noted musi- The next performance sched-

There's a war going on in 
California, a war for justice and 
survival. It's not being fought 
with bugles blaring and rifles 
bla ting; it's being fought with 
ophi ticated political campaign 

weapons. 

Don ' t be fooled , the political 
campaign over Proposition 5, the 
Indian Self-Reliance Act, is a 
war - the outcome of which will 
determine whether America ever 
intends to honor its agreements 
with Native Americans and 
whether California Indian will 
have the same economic oppor-
tunities enjoyed by all Ameri-
can. 

Instead of land, the governor 
and the U.S. Justice Department 
are threatening to take away 
Indian property - their ca ino 
games. Why? The moti ves are 
the same - greed and power, at 
the expense of America ' poorest 
people. Indian tribes have the

United States. Indians on reser-
vations have an 80 p~rcent un-
employment rate and have twice 
the risk of early death, ub tance 
abuse addiction, and three times 
the ri k of uicide. 

A few tribes have begun to 
alter these dire statistics through 
revenues earned by tribal govern-
ment casino gaming. 

Yet, the right of tribes to gen-
erate what is a mall amount of 
money, compared to state lottery 
and Las Vega gami ng revenues 
is being challenged.

MUERTOS: 
Spirits feed on the 
offrenda on earth 
Continued from page 11 
good god, made a bet with Mict-
lantc<.:u htli . If Quetza lcoatl won, 
the bone~ would regenerate and 
people could exist eternally on 
earth. But if Mictl antecuhtli won, 
the bones would stay in Mictlan 
forever. Good overcame evil , and 
Quetzaleoatl won the bet. 

But as he was ca rrying the 
boncs to earth, Mictlantecuhtli 
tripped him and Ihe bones fell on 
the land of Mictlan. Even though 
Quctl.akoatl wa ' able to bring the 
hones to ea rth, their fall in Micllan 
created a major flaw. Mietlante-
cuhtli made them immortal. In 
order to visi t their fami lies aftcr 
death, people have to pass through 
Mictlan without being caught by 
thc evi l Mictlantecuhtli . After mak-
ing it through Mictlan the spirits 
are tired and hungry, and they feed 
0 11 their olTrenda on earth during 
Los Dias de Los Muertos. 

The famili es ()f thc deccased not 
only create an altar honoring their 
loved one~. they also go to the 
cemetery to clean the grave ~ite~, 
which are de~onlled wi th flowers. 
<.:and les and other offerings. 

A <':o lllmon dccoration on the 
altar is a goofy ligurine of Mict -
lanle<.:uhtli. Although he is known 
a~ the evi l lord or the Underwor ld , 
hl! i~ ridiculed as a ligurine to ~how 
him that he is not feared . The Mex-
icans make fun of Mict lantecu htli . 
and they laugh at death to show that 
Ihey arc not afraid or il. 

The holiday is celehraled dif-
fcrcnt way~ in different regions.

BLOOD SUCKING BEAUTY 
David Reed explores the relationship between art and vampire 
By Christine Kerley 
Guardian Reporter 

Art that deftly questions reality, 
time and represcntation has a 
unique way of mesmerizing its 

much like Reed's smooth. glossy. 
almost organic-looking abstract 
paintings. 

Facing thi s wall of movie 
moments, which is next to a TV 

audience. The La 
Jolla Museum of 
Contem porary 
Art 's current 
exhibit, ··David 

I/J art 
'<:"eview 

with dips from 
vampire films 
and a mirror in 
which to con-
front one 's 

Reed Painlings: 
Motion Pictures:' captivates VISI-
tors with a <.:areer retrospecti ve on 
the highly u~c~ssful San Diego-
born abstra<.: t painter. 

Though the idea of abslract art 
makes the layman yawn at the 
immediate <.:o nnotations of blank 
geo·metri<.: fi gures on canvas, that 
dull image is w mpletely at odds 
wi th the style of Reed's work. 
From hi ' carly pai ntings of the 
1970s to hi s morc recent multi -
media installations, Reed's work 
both slyly extracts and forces par-
ticipalion from the observer. But 
the ex perience is always interesling 
and exciti ng. 

Reed's rel:cnt work ex plores the 
relationship between painting and 
!ilm. and how the viewer interacts 
with these forms of media. Very 
apropos of th is subje<.:t is hi s I:ur-
rent fas<.:ination with vampire 
movies. Small re<.:tangles of still s 
from various Ili <.: ks ahout the 
undead adhere to one wall oI' the 
mu eum. which visitors are wel-
come to rearrange. The <.:ut images 
interrupt scenes of suspense and 
hang in time, teeming wi th energy, 

appearanc~. 
viewers are allowed to read from 
the anist 's journal. Reed states that 
he wonders why. while walking 
under a light-rcllec.:ting <.: handeli cr. 
he thought of vampires ' relation-
ship~ with mirrors. Is it simply a 
matter of their lack of a soul that 
robs them of the ability to castc a 
rellection? And are observers of a 
painting also like vampires, staring 
at a scene or images. including no 
likeness of their own? 

Running with these thought s 
can lead one into a rich rea lm of 
personal intcrpretalion. The idca~ 
and images taunt and nag at the 
hrain . 

Last week, the exhibit 
also featured IWO very 
enjoyable and haunting 
films by Chri s Mark-
er. "La Jetee" 
(1962) and "Sans 
Solei I" (1982) 
played as part 
of the com-
pani o n 

installation. "Haunted: Films Cho-
sen hy David Reed." The movies 
featured intensely resonated with 
the themes of memory, loss and 
obsession. While Marker's lilms 
sat heavily on the <.:apacity of the 
intellect t() respond to an inllux of 
profound ideas, the next lihns 
will run on a lower, more sub-
tl e gear. Director Gui lIermo 
Del Toro's "Cronos'· 
( 1994) and Carl Drey-
er's "Vampyrc·' will 
play thi s Wednesday 
at 7:30 p.m. 
Hil <.: hco <.: k 's 
··Vertigo" will 
run next 
week.

MORE THAN PRACTICAL 
'fr Andersen LI. Consulting Practical Magic takes a look at the bonds between sisters 

By Brenna Hampton 
Guardian Reporter 

Andersen Consulting will be interviewing on campus 
Monday, November 9th . 

If you are graduating this fall, winter, or spring and are 
intere ted in a career with the leader in management and 
technology con ulting, get your r ume packets (re ume, 
unofficial transcript, personal data sheet, and availability 
form) to Career Services by Friday, Octobt:r 30th. 

Based on a novel of the arne 
name by renowned author Anne 
Hoffman , "Practical Magic" is a film 
worth seeing despite steep theater 
prices. It is a cross bet ween a roman-
tic comedy and a touching story of 
two sisters. Sandra Bullock ( ally) 
and Nicole Kidman (Gilli e) play the 
sisters, who arc the direct descen-
dants of a powerful witch named 
Mary Owens. Abandoned by her 
lover and outcast from Puritan soci-
ety, Owens does what many 
lovelorn, pregnant women only wish 
were pas ible; she spins a curse that 
all men who fall in love With an 

Courtesy of Tnmark Plcturesf 
Dead: Nicole Kidman (left) and Sandra Bullock (right) use witchcraft 
and whipped cream to bring the man they killed back to life . 

Owens woman wi II die an early, 
tragic death. 

Not until 
their parents die 
are Sally and 
Gillie told of the 
curse by their 
aunts, delightfully acted by Dianne 
Wiest and Stockard Channing. 
While Sally decides 10 never fall in 
love and thus protect herself from 
the curse. Gillie says "the hell wi th 
ii," and has fun . Sally casts a linal 
spell on herself so that only a man 
who cannot possibly exist will rail 
in love with her. Gillie, however. 
takes on the curse with ambiva-
lence. After sleeping with all the 
men in her small town. she decides 
to run ofT and live life supplement -
ed by her meager magica l skill s. 

Whi Ie Sally ends up tiS a widow 
with two chi ldren, Gillie tinds her-

self on a never-ending trip of bad 
boyfriends. cu l-
minating in her 
dlOice of the 
Dracula-incar-
nate for a lover. 
"Jimm y" (Goran 

Visnjk:) is a nauseating, yet intoxi-
cating, cross between vampire and 
cowboy, which. like beer and tequi-
la, shou ld never be mixed togelher. 

Sally re 'cues Gillie in Ihe nick 
of time, hut accidentally kills 
Jimmy in the process. They make a 
seri es of pour choices that eventu-
ally lead an FBI agent (Aidun 
Quinn) to their home. 

At thi ' point. viewers realize 
that they know exactly what is 
going to happen from this point on, 
but for some reason still want to 
watch Ihe movie. Director Grinin 
Dunne ("Addicted To Love") docs 

a wonderful job of holding the 
audience 's interest throughout the 
film. Subtle musk: and excellent 
cinematography by Andrew Dunne 
add to the overa ll , mystical feeling. 

Don ' t go to "Practical Magic" 
expecti ng to see explosive specia l 
effects or innovative action scenes 
with dangerous out-takes . Nor will 
you find the sex or violence tradi -
tionally associated with great 
movies. "Practical Magic" relies on 
the universal ideas of love, laughter 
and hope to carry it through the 
theaters. Helpful are the innate 
charm of Bullock and the sexy 
charisma of Kidman. which 
demonstrale that women who an.: 
sexy and powerful can al so be 
incredibly feminine and real. 
"Practical Magic" is a surprisingly 
genuine look at the bonds between 
sisters and soulmates.

BAnLE: 
Triton win again, set 
sights for Chapman 
Continued from PII'. 2. 

A win means the Tritons have a guaran-
teed spot in the playoffs and have a good 
shot to h st regionals at RIMAe. A loss, 
however. may put the Tritons' postseason 
hopes in jeopardy. In short . it is a must-win 
on host i Ie territory. 

"It is never easy to win against Chapman 
especia lly on their own Iield." Coach Brian 
McManus said . "!l 's a double-header with 
the men 's team so Chapman fans will rea lly 
be out there on Friday." 

The Tritons have gained a great deal of 
ex perience since the beginning of the year. 
McManus is very impressed with the way 
hi s freshmen have played. 

"Last year, when we got hristy 

[Abizaid[ and Cindy [Dostalek], I thought 
we couldn 't do much better than that ," 
McManus said. "But this year's freshmen 
have been unbe li evable, too. This is as good 
a dass as UCSD has had in a long time." 

Abizaid, Dosta lek and the ste llar fresh-
man class have now gelled into a superb 
squad led by Hari spe and three-time 

ational Champions Hurley and Shelbi 
Thiele. The cohesion has been so strong that 
the Triton of new have begun to dominate 
Division III like the Tritons of old. 

Nothing is guaranteed agai nst Chapman, 
though, and the Panthers wi ll definitely be 
looking for blood. 

"We are rea ll y. really exci ted for thi s 
game Friday," Harispe said. " It is the defin-
ing factor on where our season goes from 
here." 

If they just play the game al> they have 
been, the Tritons will come out victorious 
and have a happy Halloween weekend .

REALITY: 
Hoopsters gripe over 
marijuana and money 
Continued from page 28 
smoke pot, and now they are lighting even 
harder to keep that right. This i just plain 
funny. Though many of you would like to, I 
am sure that none of you have ever peti -
tioned your boss to make it legal to use ille-
gal drugs. I can almost respect the players ' 
pica for more money hut thi s argument just 
seems ridiculous to me. What's next? -
mandatory smoke-outs before games'! I can 
see it now. Karl Malone and John Stockton 
running down the COli rt , laughing hysteri -
ca lly and eating a bag of Doritos. 

Butl can 't blame everyt hing on the play-
ers. The owners are successful business-
men, and all business men know that timing 
is crllcial. This bemg said , the timing of this 

lockout could not have been worse. 
Michael ' Jordan is planning on leaving 

next season so the owners could expect 
interest to drop off. A quick history lesson 
tells us that after the baseball strike of 1995. 
attendance dropped almost 50 percent the 
following year. The combination of the 
departure of the league's prodigal son and 
the fan s' anger in the wake of lockout spell s 
substantially dec reased profits for the own-
ers in the future whenever negotiations do 
end. 

As funny as I try to make thi s lockout 
seem, I know that inevi tahly the losers arc 
goi ng to be the fans, and that is not funn y. 
Increased sa laries and a decreasing number 
of games means that the fans arc going to 
have to make up the di (,ference. 

So, I am boycotting the NBA!! Besides, 
we have football , and spring tra ining is on ly 
live months away. I'll manage without the

UCSD CWB SPORTS 
SURFING 

Last year, Sports Illustrated recognized 
UCSD as the "best surf school" in the 
country. Seventeen Magazine interviewed 
UCSD's strapping surfing squad in a boy-
hunting supplement last spring. Though 
Sports llIustrated claims 
UCSD gets the 
best surf, a la 
Black 's, and 
Seventeen claims 
that UCSD's surf-
ing contingency 
boasts not only 
"surfer-dudes" but 

"sm~t ones" too , 
neither mag talks 
about the quality of 
UCSD's surfing 
team - male or 
female. 

In recent years, 
UC Santa Barbara has 
climbed to the top of the 
National Scholastic Surfing Association 
(NSSA) chain. UCSB has always been a 
top contender and took the national title 
last year. Before UCSB dominance, 
though, UCSD reigned supreme. 

Though UCSD did not find itself on 
top after last Sunday'S season-opening 
NSSA event in Huntington Beach, the 
opening contest proved to be very promis-
ing for the fledgling squad. 

In two- to four-foot rippable A-frame 
peaks, UCSD's "A" team finished a 
promising third overall, with the "B" leam 
not far behind, finishing eighth overall. 

This strong finish did not come at the 
hands of the team's more experienced 
surfers like Josh "Champ" Rhodes, Sander 
Nauenberg or Jim Weisel. Rather, it came 
from the youth, UCSD's freshmen core 
surfed extremely well, advancing through 
several heats. 

UCSD Freshmen Holly Beck and 
Heather Long dominated the women's 
bracket, fini shing first and second overall, 
res pecti vel y. 

Freshman Garth Engelhorn finished 
seventh overall - the top UCSD men 's 
finish - only missing the finals by .5 
points. 

Junior Dylan Jones earned some 
respect in the longboard division, finish -
ing sixth overall. 

"We have a great team this year," 
Rhodes said. ''They are young and fired 
up. It's ex.citing to do so well in the first 
contest after a disappointing season last 
year. The UCSD Surf Team is working 
back to its true fonn: number one." 

- John Maynard 

CYCUNG 
Homecoming. Ahhh, the splendor. As if 

last weekend's Alumni Beer Garden, soccer 
joust and men 's water polo epic were not 
enough, the UCSD Cycling team con-
tributed to the Homecoming fest ivities with 
its Tune Trial and Dirt Criterium races. 

In both events, the team finished in first 
overall. Before Sunday's races, the team 
was skeptical about the season. 
Afterwards, however, those worries were 
put to rest. 

To say they did well is an understate-
ment. The team killed it. UCSD finished 
in Iirst place overall in the Time Trial, rid-
ing faster than leams from UC Irvine (sec-
ond), CSU Fullerton (third), SDSU 
(fourth) and UC Riverside (fifth). 

Individually, UCSD's Pete Knudsen 
took: first-place honors, followed closely by 
teammate Dan Lindell who finished in sec-
ond place overall for the men's "A" team. 

The men 's "B" and "C" learn fur-
nished a strong field as well. Each team 
posted three LOp-ten finishers. 

On the women's side, UCSD's Crystal 
Ketcham reigned queen. It was clearly her 
day. Ketcham not only won the overall 
Time Trial. she was also the overall 
women's Dirt Criterium champion by 
three minutes . 

On the men's side it was Knudsen, the 
TIme Trial winner, who repeated as the 

Dirt Criterium Champion. Knudsen 
edged out UCLA's Stephen 

Fletcher by only 7 seconds for 
the win. 

ITIlls has been a really 
exciting season so far," 

Goldberg said. "Our 
team did an epic job 
and took advantage of 
our home field. Based 

on this weekend we 
should have a 
great showing at 

regionals." 
RegionaIs will take place this weekend, 

- John Maynard 

EQUESTRIAN 
The highlight of any five-year-olds 

summer - a trip to the amusement park 
with mom and dad to a land of cotton 
candy, sunshine, and of course the merry-
go-round. Maybe there was a favorite 
horse, or perhaps a particular song that 
stirred the heart. Riding one of those hor-
sies was a blast. 

Now imagine that kid a little taller, a 
little wiser but riding real horses in a real 
competition. Th.is is the reality for mem-
bers of the Equestrian Team who had their 
first show last weekend at the Equestrian 
Team Competition hosted by the 
University of San Diego. 

Through all the jumping, trotting and 
cantering, UCSD was able to finish a 
respectable third at the competition. Erin 
Adams, Cathryn Hagar, Katie Holden and 
Erica Wiseman all turned in excellent per-
fonnances as they each earned enough 
points to move on to the next class. 

Bianca Bussey put on a standout show-
ing and placed first in both of her ride on 
Sunday, qualifying her for the High Point 
Ride off. Bussey ended up taking third in 
the event to cap her day. 

Five other riders also took first place in 
events: Heidi Kikillus, Shani Podel, 
Anneliese Kannow, Hagar and Wiseman. 

At present, UCSD is in third place in 
the division.

The NBA is Just a 
Bunch of Babies 

. Late la t night I purposely 
turned off Cheers to watch news 
about the NBA Im;koul. You 
may ask why I would choose 10 
see a bunch of bickering babies 
fighting rather than one of the 
funniest television shows ever. 
The answer is simple: I find the 
arguments between the players 
and owners more humorous 
than Norm making another joke 
about hi s obesity. 

If you guys think about it I 
am sure that you will come to 
the same conclusion. A week 
removed from the best baseball 
Season of all time and the great-
e ·t Padres' performance in the 
history of tho club. the "'por\!, 
section is now dominated by 
people arguing that an average 
sa lary of 2 milhon isn't enough 
and that it isn ' t lair to have ran -
dom marijuana test mg. 

The relationship between the 
SA players and the owner:-

has been on the verge of explo-
sive for quite some time. mak-
ing it difficult for me t) chome 
sides. n nne !.ide you' ve got 
the greedy bi lIionaires; and on 
the other. ch ildi~h millionaires. 
In thi s case. I have to go with 
the money-hungr owners. 

Can you rea ll y blame me? 
Let's take a step back and look 
at this laughable si tuation lrom 
another pOint of view. Probably 
all of you arc in the middle of 
midterms right now. The major-
ity 01 you arc ... taying up all 
hours of the night . cramming Ml 
that you might have a c.:hance at 
pa,slI1g that test. If you get 
enough good grades you wi II 
graduate and get a good job out 
of college or be fortunate 
enough to be accepted to ~rad 
sc.:hool where more work awaits 
you. 

Despite all thiS work. \)\) .\) 
percent of us will never sec the 
kind of money that the AVER-
AGE BA player makes. And 
they have the nerve to c.:omplain 
about a sa lary cap. 

PUlling the money argument 
aside. it i~ hard to take sides 
with a group 01 the people that . 
on average. an: so devoid of 
morals it would make Johnny 

ochran ' cringe. 
Latrell Sprewel l thinks that 

choking his coach is an appro-
priate response to being 
benched. edric ena llos ha~ 
decided on multiple occasions 
to take ex tended vac.:ations in 
the middle of the season. Shawn 
Kemp has to use both hands to 
count up his illegitimate chil -
dren. I know that I am not alone 
in consideri ng thi s soda ll 
unacceptable behavior. 

Because of prior negotia-
tions, the NBA players have 
effecti vely won th ' ri 'ht to

Salvation: Tritons ' striker Cindy Dostalek strides to keep the ball in bounds. She did a lot more than 
keeping the ball in play during Monday's USIU game, including a goal and 2 assists. in the 3-0 win . 

By Jacob Gordon 
Sports Editor 

This year\ Homecoming had Illany fir~ts : it 
wa~ the rir~t time C D wa~ crowned Sear~

Thankfully, nothing happened. The 3-0 Triton 

win was swift and orderly. nlike la\ t Saturday's

trol over the match. il:lling no foul go uncalled. 

The men in stripe, even tried to quiet raucous 
USI fan, when they got too rowdy. 

CSO played the way it has been 
playing lately - very. very

goa l in three games and her eighth of the season. 
tying her for the team lead with another fre~h ­
man scoring machine. Jcssic.:a Cordova. 

With the Tritons ahead 1-0. they looked to 
tack on to their lead . Once agai n. it was 

Do~talek 's speed that made the dilTerence. 
Breaking away from the pack and swerving 
around defenders. Dostalek forced the SI nfortunately. ncar the end

the game was suspended. 

When D's women's soc.:cer team viSited

The five-minute break at halftime did not

last goal on another breakaway. The winning 
streak was extended to 7 and the Tritons ' record 
raised to 11 -2-1 . 

Freshman Laura Oooly scored the first Triton 
goa l when mid fielder Janine Harispe crossed to 
forward Cindy Oostalek, who raced up the side-
line. Dmtalek then dropped the ball olT to Oooly 
in the middle who put the ball past the keeper.

There i~ onl y one regular-season game

FLAKES: The Sagehens re heduling allows UCSD to t cus on Chapman 
By Travis Hill 
Associate Sports Editor 

Pomona-Pitzer ollege got 
lucky yesterday, but it can only 
hide for so long. The Sagehcns 
were schedu led to face 01T 
jlgainst th ' SD men 's 
socccr ~quad in 

larelllont on 
Wednesday, but th 
POlllona-Pit ler athletic 
departm ' nt requested to 
reschedule the match to a later 
datc. 

The Tritons will keep a watch-
ful eye on thi s situation. hecause 
there is the possibility that th' 

. rnat c.: h will he played here in La 
Jolla. The Tritons could usc ;lI1oth-
er home contest. especia ll y again~t 
a Divi sion III rival like Pomon:l-

Pill.cr. 
With this match post-
poned. Arm trong and 

hi s staff wi II he able 
to focus their play-
ers on the higge t 

match since an earlier 
heartbreaker to al Lu -

thi s Friday 's contest in 
hapman. 

This match is probably D's 
biggest of the sea~on because of 
the post eason implications it 

brings. The Tritons went th rough a 
mid-season slump where they lost 
six of seven games, culminating 
with the al Lu defeat. That 
drought put the SD's po tsea-
son in serious doubt . 

The current winning streak has 
the Tri tons believing they can 
~neak into the playoffs, but a win 
over Chapman is essential. To put 
it bluntly. if U D loses this 
Friday. there wi ll be no postseason
