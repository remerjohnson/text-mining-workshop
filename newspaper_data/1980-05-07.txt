Students went silly in yesterday's AS run-off 
election, naming "Very Silly Students" slate 
presidential candidate Jeremy Charlton and two 
cohorts to office. 

In other run-off races , Bill Topkis was elected 
vice-president by a 100 vote margin; Warren 
Wheeler wa elected External Affairs 
Commissioner and Reggie Williams Student 
Welfare Commissioner by similar margins. 

Meg Honda for Public Relations, and Todd 
Thompson, for Activity Fee Chairman, joined 
Charlton as silly victors. 

Students also voted overwhelmingly (979-
469) against a proposal put forth by the San 
Diego Students For Peace and the AS Council 
that would have prohibited military recruiters 
from doing their work on campus. 

" I would like to offer my condolences to 
President Carter, Governor Reagan, 
Representative Anderson and Ambassador 
Bush," said president-elect Charlton when he -'"'lre;~ic;"~i;'"-;;~~~~7J~~~~ heard of his victory. 

He attributed his slate's success to a 
"campaign that was successful in getting silly 
people into the polling booths" and declined 
further comment, saying he was tired and 
sunburned from campaigning all day. 

'Linda Sabo, the "Student Interests Not 
Special Interests" candidate for president, was 
unavailable for comment. 

Silly slate victories for the two most 
important AS offices yesterday were slim, with 
Charlton edging Sabo by 35 votes and Todd 
Thompson narrowly defeating Jules Bagneris 
by 25 votes. 

Honda, however, trounced Alma Key in the 
race for Public Relations Commissioner, 
collecting 704 votes to Key's 524. 

A second referendum question on the ballot 
yesterday , asking whether a "W" should be 
placed on a student's record if he should drop a 

KelatilJl1' con.ms •• oner, attracted the largest 
number of voters yesterday, with 704 vot ••

class late in the quarter, was answered 
negatively by voting students, 1226-163. 

Responses to the drop date question, asking 
students which week during the quarter was 
appropriate for the drop deadline, were 
predominantly in the sixth week, 1,024 
answering that way. After the sixth week, 
responses dropped to practically none, but 
increased week by week towards the end of the 
quarter, and were higher in the "after the tenth 
week" category. 

Approximately 17 percent of the student 
body turned out to vote in yesterday's run-off

Racist, Insensitive Faculty Claimed by Minority Graduates 
BY CAROLYN FRIDAY 

Sacramento Correepondent 
The University of California's student 

affirmative action plans will come under 
strict legislative scrutiny as a result of 
action taken Monday by the Assembly 
Ways and Means Subcommittee 
responsible for the UC budget. 

In an effort to force cooperation from UC 
and the other public higher educational 
institutions, California Post Secondary 
Educations -Commission (CPEC) Director 
P.at Callan appealed to the committee for a 
legislative man4ate which would give 
CPEe the authority to review and make 
recommendations on all proposed and 
existing state funded outreach, support 
services and developmental programs for 
ethnic minorities. 

"Similar language was adopted in the 
past, but not quite as broad," Callan told 
the legislators. "It only referred to outreach 
programs which got us into trouble with the 
University of California, who didn't want us 
reviewing their graduate and professional 
affirmative action programs, for reasons 
which in retro pect are fairly ea y to 
understand ." 

The committee had earlier denied UC's 
request for $600,000 to Jund the 
affirmative action program on the basis of 
CPEe' re ommendations. 

UC President David Saxon, in his own 
lett r to the powerful committee this year, 
said the propo ed plans "will guide th 

university's efforts to fulfill its commitment 
to equality of access to graduate and 
professional education." 

The minority and enrollment problem at 
the graduate level is particularly severe 
since little progress has been made in recent 
years to increase minority enrollment, 
according to an Equal Education 
Opportunity Report released by CPEC 
released earlier this year. 

Under the 1960 master plan for higher 
education, the University of California 
operates all the state's professional schools 
and most graduate programs. 

CPEC criticized the university 's 
graduate affirmative action program 
because it failed to identify and address the 

pecific problem areas which are 
responsible for the static minority 
enrollment figures . 

Two yea,rs ago , CPEC quietly polled 
214 minority and women graduate 
studen .. on UC campuses to find out what 
the students perceived their needs and 
problems were. . 

But when the systemwide administration 
learned of the unauthorized survey, it 
forced CPEC to halt the study and to 
remove the results from the Equal 
Education Opportunity R port, according 
to Maricella Montez . Lopez , the CPEe 
official who ran the tudy. 

According to Dr. Alice Cox, UC 
assistant Vice President of Stud nt 
Academic Servi es , CPEC used faulty 

methodology in its survey. 
CPEC official Bruce Hamlett and 

Lopez, however, feel the univ€!'sity was 
more opposed to the blunt language the 
students employed, rather than the 
methodology. . 

Racist and insensitive faculty, 
inadequate support services and 
insufficient academic preparation upon 
entrance were the three maior baniers mOlt 
often cited by the UC mj~ority graduates 
surveyed. 

"The majority felt racist faculty attitudes 
were the greatest obstacles to minority 
students," said Lopez. 

The students also perceived a lack of 
commitment on the part of the university to 
retain students. Lopez said. 

" I think support and outreach should go 
hand in hand in any affirmative action 
program," said CPEC official Bruce 
Hamlett. "Emphasis in UC is on outreach. 
And it is really a disservice to students to 
bring them in and then have them drop out 
for lack of support services."

American Among 10 
Iran Bomb Arrests 

Iranian authorities arrelted 
an American woman as an 
alleged CIA agent and three 
other foreigners and .ix 
Iranians in connection with a 
recent wave of -bombing' in 
Tehran, newlpapers in the 
Iranian ' capital . reported 
yesterday. 

The young Moslem 
militants holding the US 
Embasay said, meanwhile, 
they had completed the 
scattering of their American 
hostage. to a dozen provincial 
ci ties in Iran. 

The bodies of the US 
Marines and Oyers killed in the 
abortive hostage rescue 
mission in (ran were flown 
from Tehran to Zurich, 
Switzerland, where they were 
transfnred to US custody by 
the Swiss governmnet and 
International Red CrOlf, and 
then on to Delaware's Dover 
Air Force Base. 

US official. have consis-
tently reported that eight 
servicemen died when a 
helicopter s,liced into a 

" 

tran'port plane in a fiery 
accident in the Iranian desert 
aa the rescue operation was 
being aborted April 25. The 
Iranian. have reported 
variously that nine or 10 
bodies were recovered from 
the aite. 

Greek Catholic Archbishop 
Hilarion Capudji, who acted 
a. an intermediary in the 
transfer of the bodies, said 
Iranian official. told him the 
nine coffins he escorted to 
Zurich held the charred 
remain. of nine persons, 
although some bodies or body 
parts were unidentifiable . 

In Wa.hington yesterday, 
Pentagon spokesman Thomas 
Ross reiterated that only eight 
American servicemen were 
killed . "We'l have to wait until 
we get to Dover to see what'l 
on the plane," he told 
reporters. 

The American woman in 
the reported .espionage case 
was not identified, nor were Ihe 
nine other perlOns said to have 
been arrelted.

Draft Funds 
Kept Intact 

WASHINGTON - Presi· 
dent <:arter's draft registration 
plan paued a major te.t 
yesterday when the Senate 
Appropriationl Committee 
refused to mak:=z cuts in the 
$13.3 million ed to carry 
out the program. 

By a 17-9 vote, the panel 
refused to reduce an 
appropriation for the Selective 
Service Sy.tem to $4.7 million 
- an amount sufficient only to 
upgrade the agency's 
computer-. , but not to start 
actual registration of 
youngstera for the draft. 

Carter'. plan still faces other 
challenges in the committee 
before it JOel to the Senate 
floor, which probably will be ita 
last .top in Congress. 

Sen. Mark O. Hatfield, R· 
OR, said he would propose 
amendments in the committee 

to require women, a, well as 
men, to regiat~, 81 Carter

Even Without Italian Bike 

Cyclist Could Win Nation After Only One Year 
BY BARBARA HAAS 

Senior Staff W riler 
She's only been racing 

competitively for one year . 
She's only been in California 
for five months. And already 
she' s qualified for the 
California Southern District 
Cycling Championships, and 
pollibly a shot at the National 
title. 

Her name is Audrey 
Thornton , and she arrived at 
UCSD in January from 
obscure Bennington College in 
Vermont, with an enrollment 
of 600, after growing up in 
Boston. In her latest race, the 
Western Division IntercoUegi-
ate Champion.hips, she easily· 
bested a field of tbp collegiate 
cyclists by 45 seconds in the 
time trials_ ThouRh it surprised 
all her comEt!titors, it merely 
reassured Thornton of her 
ability. 

Thomton entered her first 
race last year, a United States 
Cycling Federation event in 
Saratoga Springs, New York. 
She had : started. training only 
two weeks before the contest, 

but in the early part of the race 
she had already outdistanced 
the other athletes by a mile. 

Riding unchallenged 
around the track, she called 
out to her coach about the lack 
of purpose for her to finish a 
race in which there were no 
competitors. The coach had to 
go out and ride the track with 
Thorr:'ton to persuade her to 
cross the finish line and place 
first in her ' debut as a 
competitive cyclist. 

"It was really hard at first 
for me to get the idea that I 
stwuld want to win. It was hard 
to develop a winning 
mentality," Thornton says. "I 
come . from a very non-
competitive background, and I 
just couldn't see finishing 
something that wasn't even a 

" . race. 
As Thornton explains her 

feelings about the competition, 
. her expression changes as new 
thoughts spring up inside her 
head, and her eyes vary from 

gr~ to blue to green. 
.1bomton's · appearance is 

not that of an accomplished 

cyclist. Her long form 
resembles a gymnast, or 
perhaps a basketball forward , 
or quite possibly a dancer, 
which she was for 12 years. 

"I danced for 12 years, and 
finally quit when 1 was a 
sophomore. I realized that I 
would never be one, and 
people told me I couldn't be 
great," Thornton says.

"My parents were surprised 
when I decided to come here to 
Califomia to race. Neither of 
them are into any competition;

Softball 
Softball sealOn at UCSD has always been an enigma. 

Next to ill brilliant academic reputation, there is nothing 
RIOre typical of UCSD than 1M softball in the springtime. 
I mean really, 240 teams in a school of 10.000 can't be 
aU wrong. Softball is definitely big business in April and 
May in La Jolla. 

And in 1980 the balance of competitive power has 
. never been better. With ooly half of the season 
completed, all of the Budman's pre-season 
progno.tications have gone down the drain. So what else 
if new _ Our good friend with the blue cape has a1",ays

all-campus champs, swallowed not only the olive last 
Thursday but the jar as well, as they squandered a 16-4 
5th inning lead in their 19-18 disgrace against the Med 
School Longballers_ 

No need to hang their heads, though. They've got 
plenty of company. Big reputation teams of past softball

Biohazards, S8 & the Pharm Kids, Artful Dodgers, you

In their place, a whole ho.t ofpretenders have stepped 
to the head of the class. Teams like No Nukes, 

L~aIlers, Too Cool, Squeeze Mr Balls, Charlie's 
Ele ants, Fobo, Bang Gang and the Rug Rats, all get to 
fin out if they handle the pressure of being on top this 
week. 

And for all of you long-shot players, the Budman's

All-Cal 
When you mention the word invasion, most people 

tend to give it a negative conn ta tion. Let' face it, the 
USSR's invasi n of Afghanistan was not one of the more 
popular moves of the decade ... right? 

Now however, an invasion of another sort wi ll take 
place this weekend when 160 student athletes from the 
University of California's other 8 campuses trek 
southward Friday for the 15th annual All-Cal Intramural 
Sports Fes tival. This one will be announced and promises 
to be a lot more friendly. 

Representative coed teams in softball , volleyball , and 
team tennis will take part in the two-day event that is 
designed to minimize the competitive aspect of sport and 
maximi?:e the social end of it. 

Friday's events include regular team competition in 
each sport as well as mixed competition between schools. 
For the uninitiated, you haven't seen anything until 
you've witnessed the UCSB men and UCSD women 
squaring off against the Irvine men aoo Cal-Berkeley 
women in coed softball. 

On Saturday, UCSD will take advantage of its natural 
home environment as it takes the Festival to Mission Bay 
Park for an all-day program of activities that includes 
Over-the-Line and Sand Volleyball tournaments as well 
as a series of aquatic -oriented events sponsored by the

Winters Slick, but Dregs' Art Rock Original 
Superficial Jazz Pop, Canned Ethnic 
Muzak with Polish, Exploited Ecology 

BY PAUL WALTRY 
Steve Esmedina was right 

when he dubbed the Paul 
Winter Consort a cliche , 
Wandering aimlessly from 
medium to medium , their 
music is often too formulated 
to be termed jazz, and too 
loose to be called classical : the 

Paul Winter 
compromise often results in an 
intellectual form of muzak. 

Yet at his best, Paul Winter 
can be a stabilizing force for 
such talents as Ralph Towner 
and the Oregon jazz group. 

In the album Icarus, for 
example, Winter harnesses 
the tremendous energy and 
inventiveness of Oregon and 
focuses it in a polished, 
disciplined production. 
Without the energy of Towner 

or any of the other firs t rate 
musicians on Icarus, however, 
Winter remains only a stale, 
ecologically-minded compro-
mise between jazz and pop. 

Armed with Icarus and 
some "save the Whales" 
bumper stickers , I marched 
optimisti c ally into the 
Catamaran last Sunday to 
hear Winter play. As 
expected, the clientele - a ll 
aged in their later 205 -
drank Perrier water, wore 
Birkenstock sandals and had 
just returned from a "healthy 
20 mile jog. 

Straight away, I was faced 
with dozens of invitations to 
see Paul Winter "play his 
saxaphone with the whales" or 
visit Paul Winter in his 
ecologically perfect farm in 
Litchfield. Connecticut. The 
price of these excursions (a 
solid $445 for a four-day stay 
on a farm) left me feeling 
queasy about the price of 
commercialized ecology. 

The concert was really no 
different. Although supporting 
a vast array of exotic 
instruments and equipment 
from Uganda and Brazil, 
Winter concentrated his effort 
on the mo're popular 
instruments of cello , guitar and 
saxaphone.

Everyone knows that

that , thanks to the low-brow of

from the graces of critics and

Dixie Dregs a ' 'Revelation' in Progressive Rock 
Continued from page 7 of surprises, deft alternations 

'among classically derived 
chord progressions, wrenching 
hard-rock dynamics, quicksil-
ver jazz flurries, and country-
style flat picking, all handled 
cogently and at a rate of clean, 
exacting speed that is the 
province of only a very few 
players. Of other , only 
guitarist Allen Holdsworth 
(Tony Williams, Bruford, Soft 
Machine) rivals him in speed 
and technique. 

Morse, though, is not the 
typical rock-guitar ego-tripper 

c ontinually hogging the 
spotlight (though he, more 
than most , w\Juld be justified if 
he did). Instead, he is a team 
player, allowing ample room 
for the others to streich out and 
establish their identities. Smart 
move. 

In the rhythm section,

drummer Rod Morganslein

turns of The Dregs music with

Sloan - are peerless 
techl1icians who could 
eliminate their respective 
competition with a single riff 
(which is true enough), butis in 
their songwriting and 
arrangements. Where other 
progressive and fusion bands, 
good and bad, love to dress up 
bone-bare ideas with lavish 
and ·extraneous bout of 
ensemble virtuosity (adding 
precious little musical sense), 
The Dregs, with principal 
composer Morse as titular 
head, have learned the elusive 
art of continuity. 

Drawing from an imposing-
ly eclectic variety of styles, 
The Dregs combine the 
ingredients of classical, 
jazz/fusion, low-strung funk, 
hard-rock and bluegraas into 
their sound, eschewing mere 
window 'display blandish-
ments, instead achieving a 
kind of cross-reference 
intricacy. Free of jump-cut 
eraticism and, happily, 
sophomoric Iyria, the band', 
material has a unified, 
continuous feeling to it, a too-
rare trait that . puts their 
considerable talents as soloists 
in an engagingly acceasible 
light.
