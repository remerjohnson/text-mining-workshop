Asteroid Soup 
Conventionally, the early Earth was thought to be warmed by a greenhouse atmosphere, 
which would not allow the chemical reactions leading to the 9rlgin of life. But UCSD 
professors argue that asteroid bombardment could have heated the planet.

Asteroid Impacts May 
Be Key to Origin of Life 
SCIENCE: New theory unveiled 
by two UCSD professors at 
national conference last weekend 
ByDMI(,... 
Senior Staff Writer 

Asteroids the size of Los Angeles which 
plunged into Earth's early frozen ocean may 
have been the key event that led to the origin 
of life, say UCSD researchers. 

In a theory presented to the American 
Association for the Advancement of Science 
(MAS) last weekend, Professor of Marine 
Chemistry Jeffrey Bada and Professor of 
Chemistry Stanley Miller discussed an alter-
native solution to a puzzle that has locked 
scientists in debate for decades. 

Widely accepted solar evolution models 
hypothesize that when life began billions of 
years ago, the intensity of the sun was only 20 
to 30 percent of what it is today. 

"[This scenario] would lower the average 
temperature below zero degrees Celsius [32 
degrees Fahrenheit], which would freeze the 
ocean," Miller said. 

The enormous amount of snow and ice 
produced by these temperatures would reflect 
a good portion of the sun's light, dropping 

equilibrium temperatures to about minus 40 
degrees Fahrenheit, Bada said, 

,Why then, ask scientists, did the Earth not 
become a permanently frozen planet? Most 
expens embrace the notion that an atmo-
sphere with 100,000 times more carbon diox-
ide than today acted as a greenhouse, trapping 
sunlight and convening it to heat. 

But Bada and Miller have questioned this 
theory, speculating that life could not have 
arisen in an atmosphere full of carbon diox-
ide. 

"You'd have to have a lot of carbon diox-
ide in the atmosphere to keep the temperature 
above freezing," said Bada. "High carbon 
dioxide is the kiss of death for organic life." 

Proponents of the high carbon dioxide 
atmosphere theory contend that organic life 
was brought by extraterrestrial objects coil id-
ing with the earth. 

Bada, who works at the Scripps Institution 
of Oceanography, has attempted to address 
this claim by looking at the remains of extra-
tellrestrial objects imbedded in polar ice. 

In one chunk of 4,400-year-old Greenland 
ice pulled from 2,600 feet below the surface, 
Bada discovered evidence of such extrater-
restrial organic material.

Tribute to 
Mandell Weiss 
MEMORIAL: UCSD benefactor 
is remembered as friend to local 
theater and community 
By Stephanie B. Simon 
Staff Writer 

"Mandell loved a party," said La Jolla 
Playhouse Artistic Director Des McAnuff of 
the late philanthropist, Mandell Weiss, and 
the pary thrown in his honor yesterday evening 
was indeed a memorable one. 

Over 200 students, faculty, staff, family 
members, friends and acquaintances attended 
the celebration in memory of Weiss, whodied 
at the age of 102 last Dec. 29. The event 
included speeches, a slide show, a play read-
ing, a memorabilia display and a reception. 

The event began with a speech by Chan-
cellor Richard Atkinson in which he praised 
Weiss' generosity in the creation of the 
UCSD's performing ans center, which was 
eventually named in his honor. He also de-
tailed the many other honors and recognitions 
bestowed on Weiss, calling him "a benefactor 
for all of San Diego." 

Though Weiss contri buted millions of dol-
lars over the course of his lifetime to UCSD's 
Depanment of Theatre, the La Jolla Play-
house and many other Judaic and community 
organizations. many of the speakers agreed 
that he will be best remembered for his com-
passion, friendship and love of theater. 

"Mandell was more than a benefactor. He 
was a friend," said Theatre Department Chair 
Frantisek Deak. "He had a special relation-
ship with students, and their youth seemed to 
sustain him. As Mandell left the theater after 
opening nigllt, he would go backstage and 
congratulate the cast ." 

McAnuff revealed that Weiss attended the 
opening ni~ht for every production ever staged 
by the Playhouse and the Theatre Department 
at the Weiss Center, including Patrick 
Stewan's "A Christmas Carol," performed 
just weeks before Weiss' death. 

"We all loved him," said Professor Emert. 
tus Arthur Wagner, who was the founding 
chair of the Theatre Depanment. "He was a 
very lovable guy."

Chancellor Kicks Off 
United Way' Campaign 
CHARITY: Agency will contribute funds to 
countywide organizations, L.A. earthquake relief 
By Ivan Delventhal 
Guardian Reporter 

UCSO's annual United Wayl 
CHAD Campaign, which began 
Feb. 14, gives employees, faculty 
and slaff the opportunity to con-
tribule to a number of United Way 
charities through March 17. 

"The focus, this yearespecially. 
is on ensuring that people have the 
opportunity to contribute either 
money or time," Campaign Co-
Chair Barry Niman said. 

In an effort to publicize this 
year's campaign, Chancellor Ri-

CHAD, they will just pass the 
money on. We want to make it all-
inclusive," Niman said. 

Many contribution recipients 
provide year-round health and 
human care support services, as 
well as natural disaster and family 
emergency assistance. In addition, 
the donations to United Wayl 
CHAD will be directed toward 
helping homeless, unemployed 
and disabled individuals. 

This is the second year the 
United Way/CHADcampaign has 
been accepting volunteers. How-

In the past, donations to

campaign have been used exclu-

year the campaign is accepting 
money for the Los Angeles earth-
quake relief fund, as well as for 
any countywide organization the 
donor specifies. 

"If people want to designate an 
agency that is not United Way or 

campaign orga-
nizers are hoping to "tap into" 
student talent. "We are hoping for 
more participation among students 
and faculty than we've experi-
enced in the past," Niman said. 

Staff and faculty members have 
received packets containing infor-
mation on how to make donations 
via payroll deductions orone-time

CHAD, which stands for "Com-
bined Health Agencies·Drive," is 
an organization comprised of 20 
local chapters of national health 
agencies. In addition to these, 
United Way has 143 agencies in 
San Diego County.

Professor to Lecture on Alcoholism 
Some people may be more at risk for alcoholism 

beeause of their high tolerance to the effects of 
alcohol, according to School of Medicine and VA 
Medical Center Psychiatry Professor Marc Schuckit. 
He is the author of a recently published study of 
alcohol consumption and alcoholism in college-aged 
men. 

Schuckit will be speaking about the study today at 
4:30 p.m. in a lecture entitled ·A 20-Year Study of 
Children of Alcoholics and Controls." 

The lecture, which is free and open to the public, 
will take place In Garren Auditorium In the Basic 
Sciences Building at the School of Medicine and is 
part of the School of Medicine's Distinguished Faculty 
lecture Series. 

Schuckit's study suggests that in American soci" 
ety. where drinking is encouraged, people who re-
quire relatively high doses of alcohol to feel the 
effect might be likely to drink greater quantities In 
order to achieve the same level of Intoxication as 
their peers. 

Over time, people's tolerance to alcohol becomes 
even higher, and they are more likely to become 
physically dependent on alcohol. 

Schucklt directs a large, long-term study foRowlng 
237 sons of alcoholics and 237 matched controls. He 
fIrst tested the I1)8n for their reaction to alcohol eight 
to 12 years ego, and the published report describes 
aspects of the 1~ar fonow-up of the first 223 
volunteers. 

In the study, Schuckit found that both sons of 
alcoholics and matched controls who felt less Intox~ 
cated and performed well on motor·skllis tests after 
drinking three to five servings of alcohol at age 20, 
were four times more likely to become alcoholics by 
age 30. 

In his report, Schucklt describes his theory that 
there may be several genetic characteristics which 
make a man less sensitive to alcohol durlna his 

teens and 20s. This information could be used to 
educate and prevent alcoholism for those at high 
risk.

UCSD Student Stands Out at Stand-Up 
PERFORMANCE: 
Warren senior laughs it 
up on Sunday night 
By Peter AIUI 
Guardian Reporter 

For Warren College senior 
Kareem Matthews, Inking 
people laugh has always come 
naturally. A self-described 
class clown, Mauhews thought 
a foray into stand-up comedy 
might be for him. 

"This is something I've been 
thinking about doing for a long 
time," Matthews said. 

On Sunday night at Chiller's in 
Pacific Beach, Matthews will get 
his chance, as he performs in 
Chiller's Comedy Showcase. tick-
ets for the 8 p.m. show are $5 and 
can be purchased at the Dimen-
sions of Culture office in Sequoia 
Hall.

However, Bada said, the 
amount of organic compounds dis-
covered was so small that the 
chance oflife forming from such a 
"dilute soup" of organic material 
was miniscule. 

"You're really, really in a des-
perate situation [for the creation 
of life] because the amounts [de-
livered by extraterrestrial objects] 
are so, so small," Bada said. 

This evidence convinced Bada 
that organic material was gener-
ated on Earth, a conclusion that all

organization which supports 
opportunites and activities for Af-

According to Innovative En-

Holmes, the organization will use 
its portion of the proceeds for its 
scholarship fund. 

"I wouldn't have thought about 
performing if [Holmes] hadn't 

but eliminated the possibility of a 
high carbon dioxide atmosphere. 

Bada and Miller based their 
theory on the premise that the inter-
nal heat of the planet would pre-
vent the primitive ocean from freez-
ingtoadepthlowerthan I,OOOfeet. 
From there, the two scientists cal-
culated that the impact of large 
extraterrestrial objects could gen-
"erate enough heat to thaw the ocean 
and trigger the cascade of reactions 
that lead to the formation of life. 

"An [extraterrestrial] object of 
400 kilometers [250 miles] will 
boil the whole ocean," when it 
impacts Earth, Miller said. "We 
pointed out that these impacts can 
actually be beneficial."

Sunday night's performance 
won't be the first time Matthews 
has stood up in front of an audi-
ence. Last November, he made his 
comedy debut during a show at 
UCSD's Triton Pub, where he was 
voted Most Valuable Comic. 

"Most of the comedy I do is

our lives," said Matthews. He

material he would use on Sunday 
night.

60 miles in diameter were quite 
common millions of years ago and 
were large enough to thaw the 
Earth's frozen oceans, Bada said. 

Miller said that arsome point, the 
intensity of the sun was high enough 
to prevent the ocean from refreez-
ing. 'Then life took off," he added. 

Miller said the basis of the 
theory is well-founded because it 
is generally accepted that large 
extraterrestrial objects like aster-
oids and meteors pounded the an-
cient Earth. 

"The moon was bombarded un-
ti13.8 million years ago, "said Miller, 
citing evidence brought back from 
the Apollo lunar exploration mis-

certainly the Earth waS too. " 

in the past two or three years. And 
I think, at a minimum, I can be a

The American public is sick and tired of violent crime. Although 
nothing much has changed in the last couple of years - national crime 
rates have remained stable and in many cases they have actually declined 
- violent crime bas nevenheless become the crisis of the moment. Like 
the issue of illegal immigration, the issue of crime in America has proven 
to be a magnet for reckless and reactionary quick-fix measureS. As the 
"culture of violence" debate continues and proponents push for the 
censure of Beavis and Butt-head, Mortal KombatandSnoopDoggyDog, 
others continue to fight for more cops, more jails and, most prominently, 
a reformation of the criminal justice system. 

Exploiting public anger for the lofty goal of reelection, politicians 
throughout the United States have fought tooth and nail for the passage 
ofa multitudeof'1bree Strikes and Y ou'reOut" crime bills. In California 
alone,five such bills have made it past the State Legislature, and President 
Clinton, never one to miss an opportunity, has thrown one more into the 
bag just for kicks. This legislation should sound familiar. The idea is to 
sentence criminals convicted of three felonies to life in prison without 
parole. This would not only contain the most dangerous criminals, it 
would also provide a strong incentive for two-time ex-cons to get on the 
straight and narrow. 

Although this crime-busting scheme sounds fine and dandy on paper, 
''Three Strikes" crumbles under closer scrutiny. While it's a great idea if 
we're simply shopping for a way to punish "the deserving," '"Three 
Strikes" strikes out if our goal is to curb crime. It's quite true that locking 
up three-time offenders will keep them off the streets and unable to 
commit crimes. However, it does nothing to stem the tide of crime. 
Despite the rhetoric of deterring would-be third-time offenders, there's 
little reason to believe that increasing the threat of punishment will have 
an effect on crime rates - especially when we're focusing on hardcore 
criminals. This has been illustrated repeatedly by the death penalty. 
Although the United States has some of the strictest laws and sentences 
in the developed world. it continues to have the world'shighestper-capita 
rate of incarceration. 

But deterrence isn't the only issue. Perllaps more important is the 
fiscal cost of 'Three Strikes." Because of the increase in lifetime 
sentences (and the increase in elderly prisoners, who cost about twice the 
$20,000 per year average to care for), it's estimated that 'Three Strikes" 
would cost Californians between two and five billion dollars per year. 
Under 'Three Strikes," especially the bills which do not differentiate 
between three-time rapists and three-time crack smokers, the imposition 
of mandatory lifetime sentences would also increase pressure on an 
already overburdened cotut system and would undoubtedly require 
building more prisons. 

There is no logic in such a bill. Not only would it cast California further 
into financial ruin, it's unlikely that it would help quell the problem of 
crirne in America. Ifwe'rereally serious about violence on our streets, our 
solutions must deal with questions of reformation and prevention as well 
as punishment and law enforcement.lt' s a telling sign that the states with 
the lowest number of repeat offenders have institutionaliz.ed educational 
programs within prison. Perhaps when we are as dedicated to this side of 
the equation as we are to collecting our "just desserts," we can truly make 
our streets safe. 

Milken Conbact Question 
Of Academic Fr •• dom 

Politicians andacademicsjustcan'tgetalong.ltseems that every time 
professors do something controversial, public officials flex their political 
muscles to bring those shifty intellectuals back in line. At last week's 
meeting of the University of California Board ofRegents, board members 
asked for a review of a controversial Ua..A contract with convicted felon 
Michael Milken, treading on the toes of the academics in standard 
fashion. 

Fonner junk bondsman Milken co-taught classes last year at UCLA's 
Anderson Graduate School of Management at the request of a professor

COMMENTARY: Despite the achievements of the British Conservative 
government, a continuous string of scandals threatens its political survival 

ANDREW 

REYnOLDS 
WORLD 

VIEW 

Prime Minister John 
Major's ruling Conservative 
Party government in Great Brit-
ain has plummeted to an em-
bamissing third place in the 
opinion polls and is in danger 
of fai ling to serve its full tenn. 
which theoretically need not 
end until 1997. 

Usually, such slumps in 
popularity ste~ from bad ec0-
nomic news or 
diplomatic de-
feats on the 
world stage. 
However, in 
this CIISe, the 

of traditional family "morality." Butthe worst was yet to 
come. 

Last month another junior minister, Lord Caithness. 
was catapulted into the media when his wife shot herself 
after finding out about her husband's affair with another 
woman. Straight out of the pages of "pulp fiction," an-
other scandal swfaced early this month. 

A newly-minted Conservative member of parlia-
ment (MP) and former journalist Stephen Milligan was 
found dead in his London apartment under what police 
described as "suspicious circumstances." Milligan was 

discovered on a table wearing nothing 
but ladies' stockings and a garter belt, 
with a plastic bag on his head and an 
electrical cord wrapped around his neck. 
Authorities believe hediedduringasexual 
act. 

Conservatives 
have been hit by a remarkable string of 
scandals (most of them sexual) which 
wouldn't be out of place on "HardCopy" 
or "A Current Affair." In Britain. the chief 
roockrakers are the tabloid newspapers 
(most prominently, the Sun and News of 
the World), which are the predecessors to 
much of what we see in America on 
primetime ~Ievision: In the last year, they 
have happily wallowed in the stream of 
titillating details which have flowed from 
the House of COI11IIIOm.

Just when the government was ~­
ering from this blow, it was hit with the 
final punch when another new MP was 
forced to resign after admitting to an 0b-
sessive ~ with one of his 18-
year-old ~ assistants. What made 
II1IIIers worse was that this panicular MP 
inherited the p8diamemary seat of the 
beloved Margaret Thatcher when she re-
tired in 1992.

While combing through the personal 
details of these five MPs,1 came across an 
inreresting comection which may help to 
predict when and where scandals will visit 
the eo..ervative government in the fu-

als were white males who, after years of

Fust, there was the case of cabinet 
member DaWl Mellot (a.k.a. "Minister 
for Fun") who was forced to resign after 
the details' of his affair with a journalist 
made the news. At the time, Majorhad no 
idea that this was the first - and tamest 
-of many scandals 10 hit his administra-
tion. Mellor's resignatian was followed 
by the sacking of finance Minister 
Norman Lamont While Lamont was 
forced out on ideoloJical grounds, the 
fact that he was renting his second hOuse 
to a masseurfprostitute did not help his

ANTI-ABORTIONISTS HAVE A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE

Radical ant-abortion JI'OUPS have 

noc arisen because of a disparity be-
tween public opinion and the legaI 
standing of abortion, as Mr. 
Buckenmeyer claims. Virtually all 
polls show that most Americans ac-
cept the status of abortion as deter-
mined in Roe v. Wade. Abortion 0p-
ponents have become radical because 
they have lost on all fronts - at the 
ballot box, in the courts and in public 
opinion - and some have decided to 
take the law into their own hands. If 
they succeed in theireffons, it would 
send a terrible message: that you can 
achieve what you want in this country 
through terror and intimidation. Let's 
make swe they don't.

In the Feb. 17 article, "Bogus

Phillips states that "one of the rust 
things a couple must do is to verify 
whether she is pregnant or not, then 
get professional advice about her

out of financial embarrassment, his 
name was muddled again in a high-

options." Thank God that there are 
still legitimate clinics trying to do 
this! The reality of any unexpected 
pregnancy is that there are many 0p-
tions available to a woman other then 
abortion. 

Unfortunately, the purpose of an 
abortion clinic is to encourage the 
woman to kill the child inside of her. 
There is one simple reason why a 
woman will never hear all of her 

that the British economy is picking up 
and unemployment has steadily de-
clined in the last six months. How-
ever, it's quite possibile that his party 
may lose the parliamentary elections 
as a result of Milligan's death and the 
other sordid scandals, which would 
cut the Conservative majority to 15 in 

options at an abonion clinic - they 
will not want to lose business by 
telling the woman that she should 
carry the child to term. Abortion is a 
multi-million dollar industry that 
thrives on the ability to convince 
vulnerable women that the best thing 
for them to do is to terminate their 
pregnancy. 

Why would Ms. Phillips object to 
films that show the realities of what an 
abortion entails? Funher, the fact is 
abortion is an extremely dangerous 
process by which many women have 
died. How could any responsible doc-
tor not inform his patients of the risks 
of any "medical procedure!' Abor-
tionists would like nothing better than 
to sugar-coat the entire procedure by 
not informing the woman of the real 
consequencesofabonions-thatthey 
are taking a human life (the fetus is far 
beyOtK!thestageofa"c1umpofcells") 
and that by having an abortion there 
are some dangerous physiological 
ramifications. 

I hope that any woman who gets 
pregnant will not seek counsel from 
an abortion clinic because, if all goes 
according to a clinic's agenda, it will 
undoubtedly be the last stop for both 
her and her unbom child.

the years, but often it was Weiss 
himself who helped them work 
out thecontlicts. "I don'tthink it 's

"Mandell wanted very desper-
ately to be an actor when he was a 
young man," McAnuff added. 
''That might come as a bit of a 
surprise, because he was soft-spo-
ken and somewhat shy and rather 
reserved, but his passion for act-
ing was very real." 

Weiss never had the opportu-
nity to realize that dream until 
1981, when he was given a role in 
the Playhouse's production of 
"The Matchmaker." McAnuffbe-
Iieves that Weiss truly became an 
actor in his later years. but not 
because of this single role. 

"'The fact of the matter is, he did 
become an actor. I watched this 
happen, I watched him come to life 
in his nineties. He became an actor 
by living through every perfor-
mance on the stage. His passion for 
theater sustained him in his last few 
years of life," McAnuff said.

My strategy is the opposite of 
the official wisdom. My strategy 
is that a strong economy arises 

from restoring the environment 
and graduating more people from 
college. That is not so simple as it 
sounds because you have to ask. 
what does a state contribute to an 
economy, because we have a glo-
bal economy. It contributes envi-
ronmental assets and workforce 
assets. So, broadly speaking, you 
can only pursue two paths. One is 
economic growth at the expense 
of the environment and through a 
less-educated , less-skilled 
workforce that works for cheap 
labor. Or the other isjob [growth] 
from restoring the environment 
and creating a lot of high-skilled 
employment. Those are the two 
big things .... Tax policy is impor-
tant, but not as important as [at] 
the federal level. We're about av-
erage in taxes .... And regUlations 
-I'm for simplifying regulations. 
The usual call for streamlining 
regulations means lessening our 
environmental standards. I don ' t 
agree with that. If you get corpo-
rate behavior to improve from 
within, .because the corporation 
takes the environmental message 
to heart and they have incentives 
to behave accordingly, you won't 
need as much regulation and bu-
reaucracy .. .. This is like the worst 
of all systems. You' vegolto make 
penalties for pollution so high and 
the benefits for environmental 
compliance so great that corporate 
behavior will change from within. 
That's the only way to lessen all of 
the regulatory bureaucracy. 1 think. 
And I think higher education plays 
a big role in that.

THEATER 

· Burning Dreams 
San Diego Repertory's production is a narrative nightmare 

By John Godfrey 
Staff Writer 

The San Diego Repertory Theatre's world 
premiere production of the jazz opera "Burn-
ing Dreams" looked to beone of the theatri-
cal highlights of the 1994 season . The sub-
ject matter of the piece - that life is a 
dream-inspired examination of the way 
dreams and reality interact and impact one 
another - seemed particularly exciting in 
the Rep 's early publicity . 

Further, the show's artistic lineup fea-
tured some of San Diego 's more gifted, 
creative people, including co-director/co-
author J u I ie Hebert, co-wri ter Octa vio Solis, 
scenic designer Robert Brill, lighting de-
signer John Martin and costume designer 
Mary Larson. 

Despite high hopes and a wealth oCtalent, 
however, something went wrong with this 
show. Big time. 

Co-directors Hebert and Sam Woodhouse 
let this production get away from them. To 
be more specific, they let the story of this 
production get away from them. The piece 
lacks narrative clarity to such a degree that 
events on stage seem random, unconnected 
and occasionall y ridiculous. The hard-work-
ing cast engages in stage activity that seems 
meaningful to them - they dance, they 
sing, they emote like crazy - but the pro-
duction fails to translate essential elements 
of meaning to the audience. 

It 's not that 'the Rep doesn't give us 
plenty to look at during the two-hour perfor-
mance - quite the contrary. Hebert and 
Woodhouse bombard the audience with 
loaded imagery throughout the show -
they just don't give us enough context to 
make heads or tai Is ou t of what we ' re seei ng. 

This narrative shortcoming is a major 
flaw, and a thoroughly understandable flaw 
at that. Depicti ng a world of dreams onstage 
is a tremendous challenge, and the Rep 
should be applauded for both its ambition 
and its quirky inventiveness. 

Scenic designer Robert Brill captures a 
wonderful dream ambiance with his numer-
ous trap doors and rampant, relentless use of 
metaphor. John Martin's expressive lights 
amplify the non-naturalistic aesthetic on 
stage, as do Mary Larson's clever costumes. 

But what does it all mean? I couldn't 
begin to tell you. In fact, in some cases I'm 
still not sure which characters were sup-
posed to be doing what to whom during this 
show. 

The outline of the story is as follows: 
Rosaura(Anita De Simone) and Segismundo 
(Rinde Eckert) are brother and sister, but 
Segismundo dies at birth while Rosaura 
lives. By entering the dreamworld, Rosaura 
"meets" her deceased brother, her father 
(Alex Britton), and her mother (Cheryl 
Carter), and eventually comes to terms with 
the subconscious impact they have had on 
her life. 

The Rep complicates this simple storyline 
to the point of obscurity. In spotlighting the 
surreal quality of the dreamworld, this pro-
duction shoves the characters, their devel-
opment and any sense of narrative progres-
sion into the wings. 

The cast features five gi~ted singers, 
whose voices evoke emotional intensity 
throughout the Spanish-English opera. The 
acting work is less accomplished. The per-
formers fail to communicate subtle narra-
tive details in favor of broad posturing. 

Gilla Leishman's compositions are also 
problematic. During the best moments, 
Leishman's music is reminiscent of Tom 
Waits - discordant, desolate, offbeat. But 
too much ofthe music is simply flat and du II. 
The music is not visceral enough to be 
considered jazz and not elevated enough to 
be considered operatic. 

Faulkner, Strindberg, Brecht, Joyce and 
numerous other non-naturalistic authors re-
jected the Iimitationsoflinear storytelling at 
one point in their careers. In different ways 
each turned away from one of the most 
common forms of modern narrative logic-
causal reality - in favor of some various 
systems of logic. 

The Rep's "Burning Dream" is clearly a 
rejection of casual reality, but in favor of 
what? The program tells us that the produc-
tion is a "journey through a dreamworld," 
adding that "in the dreamworld, everyone is 
lost and searching." I can't help feeling that 
the creative team on this show got a bit lost, 
too. 

If this were the first of several workshop 

, Courtay 01 Eric Riet 
ROUIn (AnIta De SImone) _ICeS with a clown (Deborah Slater,. 
productions of "Burning Dreams," I would 
think that the Rep is off to a strong begilr-
ning. If we are to consider this a finished 
product, then it must be said: "Burning 

Dreams" is severely flawed. 
"Burning Dreams" runs through March 5 

at the Lyceum Theatre in Horton Plaza. For

THEATER 

New Vic Theatre 
English theater group satirizes 

Chaucer's Canterbury Tales 
By Melina Jacobi 
Staff Writer 

The success of England's New Vic The-
atre is frequently attributed to its excep-
tional talent and well-written scripts as 
well as its ability to combine comedy and 
laughter with audience participation. The 
company will perform its version of 
Chaucer's Canterbury Tales on Sunday at 
8 p.m. in Mandeville Auditorium. 

In the production, performers gather on 
the town vicar' s lawn to celebrate the 600th 
anniversary of Chaucer's story. They as-
semble to witness the competition for the 
Chaucer Cup, which is awarded to the 
person who tells the best tale. 

Members of the audience observe the 
competition along with the "townspeople" 
and vote on which of the fi ve tales they like 
the best. 

The stories chosen for the production 
are "The Nun' s Priest." "Wife of Bath," 
"The Pardoner," "The Franklin," "The 
Reeves Tale" and "The Miller's Tale." 

Its relationship with the audience sets 
the New Vic Theatre apart from other the-
ater companies, Prior to each show, ticket-
holders are invited to come onstage for a 
cup of SI. Clemens - an orange and lemon 
drink popular in London . Patrons are en-
couraged to talk to the actors and look at the 
set and props. 

But audience participation does not stop 
• 

there. "Throughout the show, the audience 
helps dictate the progression of the plot by 
voting on sequences of events. Some aud io 
ence members are even brought up on the 
stage, accidentally mistaken for characters 
in the play," said Robert Friedman, pro-
ducer of the company's North American 
tour since 1990. in a recent phone inter-
view. 

The New Vic Theatre was formed in 
1980 by Michael Bogdanov and Micky 
0 ' Donoughue and has entertained theater· 
goers throughout the United States and 
Britain. The company's roots can be traced 
back to 1973, when O'Donoughue and a 
group of actors under Bogdanov's direc· 
tion "sowed the seeds" of an ensemble-
style of theater, which placed heavy em· 
phasis on audience panicipalion. 

Today, the company continues todazzle 
audiences with its adaptations of classic 
tales to ti t the molds of popular theater. 
"They keep the integrity of the story. so as 
not to destroy the storyline. but also add in 
their British humor," Friedman said. 

In addition to TIle Cmlterl;lII:r Tales, 
the company has adapted Dracula. TIl e 
Hunchback of Notre Dallle and A Tale oj 
Two Cities. 

The New Vic Theatre wi ll perform Sun-
day at 8 p.m. in Mandeville Auditorium. 
Tickets for students are $ 14. For more 
information, call 534·6467.

A lot of people don't realize how much goes into making a film. Creating 
illusions with photographs being flickered, that in itself, that's art. But as a 
student. reality kicks in fast. Having a budget of a few hundred dollars for my 
senior thesis film, that's reality. I COUldn't afford 'Star Wars' type special 

effects. I got the actors to volunteer to be my aliens, free. And used the 
American Express'· Card to charge major expenses like film and 

processing. The Card helps me stick to a budget. (It even helped 
me save serious money on a flight to New Orleans. with my 
Continental voucher.) Working on the film for no mooey, and long 

hours, tempers got a little short. So, 
the Card came in handy at my wrap 

party. We all became friends again. The 
American Express" Card works. For real.

BASEBAll .. : 
Tritons go 2-1 
ContInued from .,... 14 
Delfavero led off with a double, 
and Ramirez drove him in with a 
base hit. Ramirez advanced to sec-
ond on the errant throw home, and 
then to third on a Bobby Arban 
sacrifice. Buu Aaron walked to put 
runners on first and third. 

With Armando Sanchez up, 
Aaron took off for second. Ramirez 
scored after a wild throw by Alder-
man, while Aaron went around to 
third. Sanchez picked up an RBI 
with a base hit that scored Aaron, 
giving UCSD a 3-1 lead. 

Greg Sims starred for the Eagles 
with a couple of hits, 2 RBIs and two 
amazing diving catches in left field. 

Idaho knotted up the score at 3-3 
on Sims' second RBI-single, but. 
again, UCSD answered. 

In perhaps the most important 
inning of the ballgame, UCSD 
scored the go-ahead run with two 
outs. Jason Aguilar singled and stole 
second, setting the table for Chris 
Miyake. He laced a single into left 
field to drive in Aguilar. 

"Miyalce was duc," Yates said. 
"He had been hitting the ball well all 
day, and we knew that if we could 
keep giving him chances, he would 
come through." 

In the bottom of the seventh the

Tritons added an important insur-
ance run. 

O'Brien led off with a singie, 
and DelFavero sacrificed him to 
second. Ramirez (2-3, RBI) then 
tapJied a dribbler toward second 
base, and he beat out the throw for 
an infield hit. An error allowed 
Arban to reach, loading the bases 
for Aaron. Aaron came through, 
lining a sacrifice fly into deep1ight 
field and extending the lead to 5-3. 

Hartmann (2-0) got stronger as 
the game progressed. Afterdodging 
his way in and out of jams in the 
early-going, he silenced the Coy-
otes for the final three innings, pick-
ing up a complete game win. 

"Our pitching has just been phe-
nomenal, and [Hartmann] was no 
exception," said Yates. "We played 
so much better today. We had better 
focus, better execution, and we' re 
gaining momentum." 

The momentum didn' t carry over 
into Wednesday, however, as the 
Tritons ran out of steam in a 3-0 loss 
to SCC. 

Playing in its third game in three 
days, UCSD went with sophomore 
Marc Abrams as its starter. Abrams, 
who had pitched only one inning 
this season, threw a great ballgame. 
But two lead-aff walks and a shut-
out performance from SCC pitcher 
Paul Gutierrez proved too much. 

The Vanguards got to Abrams

early in the bottom of the first. 
Abrams walked lead-affhitter Bryan 
Seidel, and then gave up a hit-and-
run single to Jason Albrand. Jason 
Brissey brought Seidel home with a 
sacrifice fly to give SCC a 1-0 lead. 

From then on, Abrams (7IP, 3ER, 
3H. 4K) was in cruise control. He 
set down the next 16 batters before 
givingup asolo home run to Bri ssey 
in the bottom of the seventh. 

In the eighth, Abrams (0-1 ) 
walked Brandon Dekker to open the 
inning. Yates brought in his closer 
Luhrsen to try to keep the game 
close, but a stolen base, a sacrifice 
bunt, and a sacrifice fly by Ken 
Turner produced the third run of the 
game for the Vanguards. 

That was more than enough lee-
way for Gutierrez, who held the 
Tritons to just four hits on the day, 
two coming from DelFavero.

fense." But you haven't seen any-
thing until you've witnessed the 
aggressive play of the "skeleton 
crew." 

The UCSD 
Ice Hockey 
Team (1-6-3), 
lacking scoring 
but definitely 
not heart, ar-
rived in the Bay 
Area last week-
end with 10 
players and no 
coach for two 
tough match-
ups against San 
Jose State and 
UC Berkeley. 

The team 
came home 
with ugly 13-0 
and 7-1 losses 
- and a new 
nick.name. 

anything," team captain Steve 
Schwartz said. "It was the most 
brutal hockey game I've ever seen." 

With fists thrown right and left 
and cross-checking rampant. San 
Jose took full advantage. 

. The bad 
luck continued 
against Berke-
ley the next 
night. Weary 
from travel and 
extended play-
ing time, the 
"s keleton 
crew" lost to 
the Golden 
Bears, 7-1, but 
not without 
controversy. 

"Our top 
linecouldn'tgo 
on the trip," UCSD goalie lit up by Berkeley. 

With Ber-
keleyup4-0in 
the first period, 
UCSD for-
ward Jason 
Barglow 
knocked in a 
goal that was 
eventually dis-
allowed be-

defenseman Stewart Marcano said. 
"It was just the skeleton crew out 

cause the goal had come dislodged. 
Despite disagreements with the 

call. UCSD immediately responded 
with another goal. 

there on the ice." 
Though they fell behind early in 

the first period against San Jose, the 
San Diego skaters played hard-nosed 
hockey. Without a coach, line 
changes were made from the bench. 

"We really came together on this 
road trip," said Marcano. "Every-
one played hard, especially to pro-
tect our goalie."

Rugby 
The UCSD rugby team (2-1) 

took a break from league play 
last weekend to take pan in the 
2300 annual OMBAC Tourna-
ment at MissiOn Bay. 

San Diego competed in a total 
of four games over the weekend, 
losing to Claremont and San Di-
ego State's A and B teams, while 
successfully pulling out a victory 
over Cal State San Bernardino, 
10-3. 

In its showdown against San 
Bernardino, San Diego success-
fully avenged a preseason loss to 
CSUSB. 

In a physical battle. UCSD 
muscled its way on top with the 
help ofEthraim "Cash" Brammer 
and Mark Bazzet. 

The OMBAC Tournament has 
a reputation for being very rough. 
This year was no exception for 
UCSD. Ben Spike suffered a 
concussion, while Mike Picco 
was hampered by a minor break 
in his hand.

Ultimate Disc 

There was good news and bad 
news for the UCSD men's ulti-
mate disc team after the UCSD 
tournament last weekend. The B 
team won its division, but the A 
team lost a close game to UC 
Davis in the quarterfinals. 

The UCSD B team went 4-2 
on its way to the title, losing close 
games to A teams from UC Santa 
Cruz and Los Positos College, the 
tourney's top-two seeds. 

The UCSD A team did not 
perform as expected, committing 
untimely mistakes. 

"The A team did not look good, 
but they'll bounce back," Cliff 
Hanna said. "Part of the reason 
they didn't do well was because 
we usually combine the two 
teams."

Women's Lacrosse 

The UCSD women's lacrosse 
team traveled to Santa Barbara 
last weekend toc:ompete in a non-
league tournament. 

Following a tough first day of 
competition, which included a 
sound defeat at the hands of UC 
Davis, UCSD regrouped for 
Sunday's match against 
Humboldt College. 

The new day brought better 
results for UCSD. San Diego 
pummeled Humboldt by five. 

"Humboldt's a very good 
team," UCSD Head Coach Diane 
Wipple said. "We played very 
well." 

The victory was a confidence-
booster for San Diego, especially 
in light of the fact that three de-
fensive starters were out of the 
action, forcing Wipple to rework 
her lineup for the contest., 

UCSD, ranked second in the 
Southern Division, hopes to be 
completely healthy in time for its 
big matchup against the Univer-
sity of Arizona on Saturday, Feb. 
26. Arizona is ranked fifth in the 
Southern Division.

HIllEII 
Aren't There 
Any Other 
Skaters? 

Haven' t we seen this 
somewhere before? All the 
lights, cameras and micro-
phones shoved in the face of 
the attention-grabber, the one 
who attracts the inquiring 
minds. 

"What does he think about 
the game?" ask the masses. 
·'What's her angle on the 
competition?" 

It happens countless times 
in sports. Focus on the favorite, 
and the unknown creeps up and 
surprises everyone. 

The 1994 Winter Olympic 
Games in Lillehammer are no 
exception. The ongoing Tonya 
HardinglNancy Kerrigan 
gossip train chugs on. 

The UCSD Guardian Thunday, February 24,1994 

Kerrigan gets a TV special 
with all of her friends. Harding 
completes four out of five 
sextuple-toeloop-axle-lutzes. 
Kerrigan talks to David 
Letterman's mom. Harding 
tells Connie Chung to go to 
hell.

All we hear about is Tonya 
this, Nancy that. Yes, this 
scenario has been established 
under somewhat goofy 
circumstances, what with the 
clubbing of Kerrigan's leg and 
all. But geez, ain't it a bit 
much?

In the 1984 NCAA college 
basketball title game, every-
body talked abous Patrick 
Ewing, Reggie Williams and 
the unbeatable Georgetown 
Hoyas. What happened? 
Villanova cut down the nets. 

In the 1988 World Series, 
nobody was supposed to 
conquer Jose Canseco, Mark 
McGwire and the mighty A's 
from Oakland. What hap-
pened? The Dodgers beat them 
in five . 

In the 1993 Breeder's Cup, 
the experts said to bet the 
house on the entry of 
Bertrando, Marquetry and 
Missionary Ridge. What 
happened? Some 130-1 
longshot made everybody look 
foolish, not to mention poor. 

The entire free world has 
gone completely bananas over 
this HardinglKerrigan "show-
down." And that's exactly why 
neither of them will capture 
anything resembling a medal. 
Nevermind Kerrigan's first-
place performance in last

This has been tournament week 

for the UCSD baseball team, and 
after three games of the Southern 

California 
College Invi-
tational, it is 
still in conten-
tion for the 
tournament 
noH~"""''' title. 

The Tri-
tons captured 
their first two 
games against 
Concordia and 
Idaho, but a 
loss to South-

ern California College on Wednes-
day makes Friday's match-up with 
Biola a must-win for the Tritons to 
advance to Saturday's final. 

The action-packed week began 
on Monday when the team hit the 
road for Irvine. The lone run of the 
game was a third-inning gift to 
UCSD. 

Craig Birk worked a two-out walk 
off of Eagle starter Trevor Earle. 
Dan O'Brien then reached base on 
an error by the shortstop, putting 
runners on first and second. Earle 
hit AI DelFavero with a pitch. load-
ing the bases for Ricky Ramirez.

Ramirez reached on another error, 
allowing Birk to score. 

Earle (9IP, OER, 7H) deserved a 
better after his masterful perfor-
mance, but he was instead saddled 
with the loss. 

One run was all that Ryan 
F1anagan(7213IP,OR.6H.6J(.IBB) 
needed. He limited the Eagles to six 
hits and only allowed three runners 
to reach third base. In the process, 
he extended his scoreless inning 
streak to 13 and 213. 

Kurt Luhrsen worked the Tri-
tons out of a two-out. two-on jam in 
the eighth to earn the save and pre-
serve the 1-0 victory. 

"Ryan showed good control out 
there. He had them completely 
fooled, and [that] was good, be-
cause offensi vely we were not sharp 
at all," Head Coach Lyle Yates said. 

Some of that sharpness returned 
Tuesday during the Tritons' 5-3 tri-
umph over Idaho College at Triton 
Field.
