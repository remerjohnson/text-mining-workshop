'Students First!' Presidential Candidate 
Sabatini Victorious in Run-Off Election 
By Laura Lamb 
Staff Writer 

Eleven percent of the UCSD student body -
1,648 students - cast its votes during 
yesterday'S A.S. run-off election, electing Stu-
dents First! candidate Coleen Sabatini as the 
new A.S. president. 

In other results, independent candidate Marku'i 
Wong captured the commissioner of academic 
affairs position; Alex Sario of Students First! will 
be the next commissioner of student advocacy; 
and U.N.I.T.E. 's (Uniting New Ideas Through 
Experience) Ritesh Khullar will be the new War-
ren sophomore senator. 

Sabatini, who received 56.1 percent of the 
t'otescompared to Hearn's43.3 percent, expressed 
her gratitude toward her supporters after the re-
sults were announced. 

... want 10 say, fintoh", 'Thank you' to all the 
students who went out and supported Students 
First'" she said. 

Sabatini promised to fulfill her campaign proto-

ises to be pro-active and pro-student. 
"We're going to get started tomorrow," she 

said. "We just want people to know that our door 
is open when they have an issue." 

Hearn congratulated Sabatini on her win. 
"I think Coleen is a very capable individual... 

[and] she'll do a great job next year," Hearn said. 
"I just hope that students move forward and gain 
more power on this university .... I think that's 
what the students voted for." 

Wong beat U. .I.T.E. candidate Carol Tran by 
only 24 votes. 

"Hopefully, Markus Wong can bring in some 
really good ideas to the office," Tran said. 

Sario received 54.7 percent of the run-offvotes, 
beating U.N.I.T.E.'s Irene Feldman by 146 votes. 

Khullar, who beat Students First! candidate 
Jon Salunga by only four votes, expressed mixed 
feelings toward winning . 

"I 'm surprised that four votes could make a 
difference," he said. "I wish more people would 
come out to vote." 

Shadab Claims 
A.S. Electiqn 
Violation 
UNFAIR: Ex-commissioner 
claims bias against 
independent candidates 
By 'van De.ventha. 
News Editor 

Former A.S. Commissioner of Commu-
nication Farsam Shadab said yesterday he 
will "fight tooth and nail" to invalidate the 
recent A.S. elections which, according to 
him, violated A.S. election bylaws. 

In his violation report, Shadab claimed 
that the structure of the A.S. ballot offered 
candidates who were members of a slate an 
undue advantage over independent candi-
dates. . 

"My basic gripe questions the design of 
the ballot," Shadab said. " Under each 
candidate 's name, if you ' re in a slate, it has 
the slate name, [but] if you ' re an indepen-
dent candidate, it has absolutely nothing 
there. " 

In his violation report, Shadab cites ar-
ticle 5, section B, subsection 1, item "j" of 
the election bylaws, which places limits on 
campaigning in the vicinity of polling places. 

The bylaw states that: " It shall be a vio-
lation ... for any candidate, and/or slate, to 
campaign within 50 feet of the polls on 
election days, as measured by the Elections 
Manager." 

A.S. Election Manager Jay Park declined 
to comment on the report. 

Meanwhile, outgoing A.S. President 
Naomi Falk criticized Shadab's move to 
nullify the election. 

"I think it 's unfortunate given the money 
spent on elections and the hard work people 
put in, that [Shadab] would try to negate 
these efforts and get the election invali-
dated," Falk said. 

While Falk acknowledged that belong-
ing to a slate can potentially benefit a candi-
date, she said that having the slate listed on 
the ballots, beneath the candidates' names, 
did not constitute an "unfair advantage." 

"The purpose of having a slate is to 
identify people who have similar ideolo-
gies," Falk said. "[Shadab's] charge that a 
slate name listed on the ballot is propaganda 
is not true." 

Shadab, however, insisted that having 
the Ae name beneath a candidate's name 
on the ballot is inappropriate, &nd consti-

Renowned Sci-Fi 
Author Visits UCSD 
SPACE: David Brin discusses exobiology and the 
(so far) unsuccessful search for extraterrestrial life 
By Chris Schreiber 
StBffWriter 

While people often wonder 
whether other intelligent life ex-
ists in the universe, noted science-
fiction author and scientific lec-
turer Dr. David Brin says the 
chances are slim. 

time and couldn ' t keep a lid on 
Watergate be able to keep such in-
formation a secret? 

Unlikely on both counts, Brin 
said. 

Citing Manhattan Project physi-
cist Enrico Fermi, Brin noted that 
extraterrestrials - if they exist -
should have found Earth by now. Brin gave a lecture Tuesday 

before approxi -
mately 100 UCSD 
students and fac-
ulty members at 
UCSD's Graduate 
School of Interna-
tional Relations 
and Pacific Stud-
ies, entitled "The 
Oreat Silence: Is 
Anybody Out 
There?" 

Brin spoke for 
two hours on vari-
ous subjects, in-
cluding the origins 
of life, possible 
solutions to min-
erai and power 
shortages via aster-
oid mining and so-
lar-energy farms 
on the moon and, 
of course, extrater-
restrial life. 

"I le.rned .bout 
varlou. modes 
of space 
exploration I 
hadn't heard of 
before, and he 
explained thin •• 
In a manner I 
could actually 
understand. " 

Brin showed 
various math-
ematical calcula-
tions that implied 
if intelligent life 
existed and spread 
outward at a rate 
consistent with 
Earth 's expansion 
into space, we 
would almost defi-

'" learned about various modes

One of Brin's main points was 
that life probably originated on 
many other planets which had the 
n41cessary features to support life 
- water supply, specific minerals 
and precise levels of light, tem-
perature and gravity. 

However, Brin said the exist-
ence of extraterrestrial life is a far 
It)ore dubious proposition. Brin 
explained that, despite extensive 
efforts, no sign of intelligent life 
has been encountered . He 
downplayed UFO aficionados'

questions: First, why would the

A.S. Officer Denounces Racism 
CRIME: Alex Tom 
cites need for greater 
eduation of community 
By Laura Lamb 
Staff Writer 

A.S. Counci l member and Uni-
versity of California Student Asso-
ciat ion member Alex Tom at 
Wednesday 's A.S. meeting urged 
the council to recognize the wide-
spread existence of racism in the 
community, and noted the need to 
educateall members of society about 
its dangers. 

Tom, who is of Chinese descent, 
played a message left on his answer-
ing machine several weeks ago, in 
which an unknown caller used ra-
cial slurs to insull Tom's support for 
affirmative action. He received the 
call following his speech at a March 
12 rally on the "National Day of 
Action." 

" We're going to change the im-
migration laws to keep more people 
of your kind out of the country, and, 
as far as abolishing affirmative ac-
tion, that will help a lot of your 

slant-eyed relatives, since a lot of 
them are denied admission to col-
leges right now to make more room 
for dumb niggers and dumb spies," 
the caller said. 

" [ AffirmativeactionJ isdiscrimi-
nation in favor of dumb spics and 
evidently a bunch of dumb, fat Sa-
moans," the caller added. 

Tom explained that police were 
initially hesitant to file the call as a 
" hate crime," usually preferring to 
label such incidents as "harassment" 
- a term which overlooks the racial 
aspects of the crime. 

"People need to be aware that 
racism does exist on all levels, in a 
blatant form," Tom said. He also 
mentioned that he has been the vic-
tim of similar hate crimes in the 
past. 

A .S. President Naomi Falk 
voiced her support of Tom's efforts 
to make more students aware of the 
existence of racism in the commu-
nity. 

" I think that when many people 
think of racism, there's a general 
perception that [it] doesn 't exist 
anymore, or when it does, it's an 

isolated experience," she said. 
" But, i fyou talk to people on this 

campus, or in the community, this 
type of thing happens on a regular 
basis," Fa lk added. "We need to 
educate people about it... [and] the 
first thing to do is admit that i t 's out 
there." 

A .S. Vice President External 
Brian Dowd agreed. 

" lI's not j ust an • Alex Tom' is-
~ue. It 's an issue about people, ~ 
Dowd said. 

Tom discussed WIth 
council members his hope to pass a 
resolution offiCially demonstrating 
their opposition to hate crimes. Tom 
also invited all members to a forum 
on Thursday, May 3 - during the 
Pan-Asian Celebration Week - to 
discuss the issue of confronting rac-
ism in the community. 

"People can ' t sit idly by and dis-
miss the issue of racial discrimina-
tion and hate crimes," Tom said. 
"This is something I hope all of [the 
A.S. Council) will support as repre-
sentatives of the large constituency 
that is affected by t his issue. " 

"This issue cannot die," he said.

Cheating is a Blight on 
Biology Department 

Cheating currently abounds in our Biology Department, a 
deleterious state of affairs in which studems copy lab 
procedures, answers to questions and even re ults off labs 
previously completed by other students. This excessive 
cheating threatens the academic integrity of UCSD, the 
Biology Department, and the hi gh standards both institu-
tions try to uphold. 

Estimates of cheating run as high as over 90 percent of 
all lab students. The Biology Department needs to remedy 
this problem, acting immediately to preserve its reputation 
of academic honesty . 

'A problem thi s severe requires tough solutions. First, the 
Biology Departmem should change the curricula of the labs. 
The current labs have remained basically the same for the 
last decade. The administration should go with a national 
lab curricula. which usually changes every year. If this 
proves prohibitively expensive, then the professors them-
selves should overhaul the curricula with several differem 
lab manuals, all of which could be rotated on a yearly basis. 

Second, the T As should be instructed to check students 
who appear to be copying from labs in class. This may seem 
obvious - but previous incidents have hown that some 
TAs Jet such activity go unchecked. T As should also check 
the lab data and see if it makes sense given the experimental 
conclusions. While they may not have time to do this with 
every lab, they could check randomly selected labs each 
week. This would help dissuade blatant cheating. 

Finally, having students lum in their completed labs to the 
department at the end of the quarter would make it more 
difficult for the students to obtain finished, graded labs. 
Students do not really need their labs to prepare for the MCA T 
or the biology GRE: material much more useful for preparation 
can be obtained through preparatory books or classes. 

In the cnd, the Biology Department should sen~ a mes-
sage that cheating - of any kind - is ~nacceptable . [t 
should act expeditiously to defend its integrity before this 
outbreak of cheating damages it beyond repair.

A.S. Election Manager 
S.hould Respect Public Info 

Few students who voted last week in the A.S. e1eclions 
were aware of the fact that one of the candidates had 
dropped out of the running before race began. As a result, 
some students voted for a former candidate who should not 
have been on the ballot. 

By disregarding the importance of informing students that 
former Commissioner of Academic Affairs Candidate Christy 
Guidi dropped OUI of the race, A.S. Elections Manager Jay 
Park essentially duped vOlers into thinking they could vote for 
Guidi. This ridiculous situation could have been avoided by 
printing ballot inserts which listed the remaining candidates. 
Such updates could have been handed out to vOlerS at the polls, 
thus avoiding the mishap altogether. 

However, .Park has managed to further convolute the 
situation by withholding election-result information from 
media inquiries. Although he released numbers for the other 
candidates. the results of the commissioner of academic 
affairs race are conspicuously missing from the public 
record. The two remaining candidates. Carol Tran and 
Markus Wong, competed in a runoff election yesterday -
the only race which had no available numbers from last 
week's votes. 

Worse yet. the A.S. has not uttered a peep about the •

OPINION 

GROUNDWORK BOOKS S'llLL 
STUCK IN THE GROUND 

COMMENTARY: Must the poor students at UCSD continue to be 
forced to buy their books in this embarrassing store?

Every time it happens, I get 
nervous. My palms begin to 
sweat and my pulse quickens. 
Fi nally, I enter. 

Often, I have nightmares 
abo ut my quarterl y trip to 
Groundwork Books. After all. 
a sane perSon ean only endure 
so much si ll y left-wing bab-
bling before he explodes. Butl 
find the best way to handle this 
dreadful situation is just to get 
it over with as 
quickly as 
possible. The 
longer one 

the same outdated ideologies: "Bring back affirmative 
aClion!", "Fight oppression!", "People, not profits!" 
There's not even a harmless "Have a nice day!" pin. 

Around the other comer, you can get bumper stickers 
if you really want to spread the word about the upcoming 
revolution. You can also tell everyone how you'd rather 
be "smashing imperialism" (but just can't get lime of! 
work to do it), or' how we shou ld all fight racism (a truly 
profound idea that bumper stickers, of all things, wi ll push 
to fruition). As you approach the check-outline, you arc 
swamped with bell igerent signs telling you that you can-
not use a credit card or plus card . After all, Groundwork 

doesn't want to endorse such capitalist, 
oppressive endeavors. Instead, you are 
forced to pay with cash or write a check, 
a tiring and archaic process where they 
make you include practically every tiny 
bit of infonnation on the check, from 
your mother' s maiden name to your 
place of birth.

plaining about having to walk through 
the store, read the propaganda, or actu-
ally give money to these people, the 
more he is likely to despise the whole 
episode. JUSI suck it up, go in, try not to 
read the signs, and get the hell out. It's 
your best shot. 

Personally, I can discuss the ernbar-
rassment we call Groundwork Books so 
gleefully because I am through with it I 
have purchased my boob for my final 
quaner at UCSD. As. for the rest of you 
poor saps, though, I can only offer my 
condolences and a brief discussion of 
Groundwork Books, including what 
you' ll have 10 put up with, should you 
have the misfonune of one of your 
classes sclli .. its books ~. 

I'y ....... 

After buying your books - no doubt 
inundated with similar propaganda -
you will be handed a receipt with the 
college left-wing feel-good phrase of the 
month. Right now, its "Fm: Mumia!" -
a noble effort to put a convicted mur-
derer out on the streets. Pemaps ne1lt 
month, it will be "Save the Whales!"

Now, I would have absolutely no 
qualms about Groundwork. Books or any 
other establishment lilte it, u long as I 
wun't forced to go inside and do busi-
ness with them. But the university re-
quires that 1 purchase my boob there (if 
I want to rad f!Jl' my closes and do 
well), subjecting me to clic~ ideolo-
gies that I don't support, and effectively 
endorsing those ideologies with public 
money. 

In the first place, let me succinctly

COMMENTARY: In reality, hate crimes throughout U.S. history have had more to with the maintenance of 
traditional power relations than with immediate issues of race 

IMMIGRANT BEATING WAS SIMPLY A HATE CRIME 
By Kathleen Lytle 
Slaff Writer . 

The beating of Rodney King 
was not an isolated incident. And 
neither wa the unmistakable attack 
on illegal immigrants by Riverside 
police officers on April I. It was 
t:cnainly nO I an "emotional out -
burs t" resulting from a long and 
dangerou~ car chase. 

It was a hate l: rime. Simply lis-
tening to the audio tape of the " in -
cident ," in which one police officer 
calb the immigrant s "wetbac ks" 
after slamming a baton across their 
bodies. wi ll dispel any doubts of 
this conclusion. 

If the term "wetback" isn 't ter-
rifying, then you mu t not be aware 
thai whites lynched more Mexicans 
duri ng the height o f American 
lynch-mob violence around the tum 
of thi s century than they d id blacks. 
And if the term " lynching" does not 
cause your throat to tighten, then 
understand that American race re-
latillns wi ll not improve until you 
beg in 10 under tand the true mean-
in g and e motion behind such 
word .. 

Hate crimes In this coun try ex-
tend as far back as the ea rl y co lo-
nial days. During the centuries of 
legalized slavery, lynching was a 
popul ar method used to keep all 
"uppi ty" fo lks in their place. 

At that time, jJ lacks comprised 
less than 10 percent of those who 
were ly nched. The overwhelming 
majority were in fact poor whites, 

as they were often known to incite 
slave insurrections. Because the 
Old South hinged upon social , po-
litical and spiritual apanheid based 
on color, anyone who violated these 
tenets would be lynched for his or 
her trespasses . Any white who 
dared to cross the racial divide was 
murdered with the same fervency 
as a black who demanded freedom . 

II was only after the emancipa-
tion of slaves that the number of 
blacks lynching victims skyrock-
eted. That's bct: ause a free black is 
more dangerous than a suppressed 
one. You only need to lynch one 
person to send a message to mil-
lions of others - the cornerstone 
philosophy of the night rides and 
nigger hunts. 

While only a few whites com-
mitted these crimes, America was 
- and continues to be - a na-
tion that turns the other cheek . 
For eac h black Iynchcd , othcr 
blacks were warned. By the ame 
toke n. every murde red white 
served as deterrent to future white 
radi ca ls . And eac h di s posed 
Mexican reinforced the warn ing 
aga inst imm igration. 

Rcgardless of whether the vic-
tims were white, black or Mex i-
can, mob violence was , and is , 
sanctioned to maintain tradit ional 
posi ti ons of power. Hate crimes 
are not primarily about race , gen-
der, sexuality or religion - they 
are about power. On Apri l I , 
1996, Riverside police negotiated

power wi th thei r batons. 

Poor whites u ed to lynch poor 
whites, and, as. rapper KRS-ONE 

once stated, "It 's black cops kill-
ing blaek kids in Johannesburg." 
The only power a poor white has is 
psychological. His pale white skin 
color affords a few privileges 
which generally have nothing to do 
with whether there will be enough 
food for dinner. 

But it is still the idea of white 
supremacy from which many try to 
squeeze sustenance. But what 
power did a black cop have in 
apartheid South Africa? Not much. 
and he still murdered for a govern-
ment wh ich spat on him. Race-
based polit ical structures are not 
simple. They arc bloody and con-
fused, becau e only power is in 
contention. 

You may wonder how attacks 
upon eve ryday people like 
Rodn ey King - o ne so 
uninvolved in challenging the sta-
tus quo - can be connected with 
attacks upon "uppity " blacks and 
whiles. It may be diffi cult fo r a 
society so deeply steeped in the 
fallacy of ind ividuali sm to unde r-
sta nd that, fo r peop le of color, 
nothing has ever been about the 
ind ividual. Ind ivid ual freedoms 
are a group privi lege reserved fo r 
whites. Rac ial SUbjugati on is for 
people of color, and th is reason-
ing ap plies to hate cri mes as well. 

Wh ites were not likcly to be 
hung unl e s they took an indi -
vidual stand agai nst the tatus 
quo . Group-ba cd raC Ial privi lege 
for whites protected them from 

random violence. Whereas for 
people of color hale crimes are 
rarely aboutlhe action s of an in-
dividual , but rather aboul the po-
silion of the race in society. John 
Brown was hung for his indi -
vidual actions in leading a slave 
revolt. Rodney King was beaten 
because o f the color o f his skin . 
Immigrant men and women were 
attacked on April I by police of-
fice rs because of ass umpti ons 
abo ut co lo r and c iti ze nship . 
While John Brown was an indi-
vidual , the olhers were just that 
- "others." 

During the 1992 Los Angeles 
Rebellion. white Americans were 
outraged by the Reginald Denny 
beating. II seemed to be innicted 
wilhout purpose. Whi t had Denny 
done to any of the young men who 
beat him? Nothing. At that unique 
mo ment in Amer ic an hi story, 
Denny became the "other," and the 
young black men became individu-
als. 

It was an ironic hate crime. The 
most immediate method of power 
- physical power - belonged to 
people of color, and 'they did not 
hesilate to exercise it. Dcnny was 
stuck in a rnomenl of time where 
his color put him in a roup of "oth-
erness." As such, he was the vic-
tim of a random hate crime which 
sent a message, not to him as an 
individual, but to his group of "oth-
ers."

THE PEOPLE'S VOICE REsPONDS TO CRITICISM 
Editor: 

Once again, Peter Chang 
("UCSD's Alternative Media Fails 
Again."ApriIIl,I996)squandershis 
time and talent espousing literary 
vomit disguised as i,*lligent thought. 
Chang tries to sway others into be-
lieving any promotion of di versity by 
students of color is inferior. 

We do not take these attacks 
lightly. The focus of our newspaper 
is to educate and unite students be-
cause the GUIlrdilJn minimizes any 
at1empt to do so and indeed bombards 
a decreasi ng fraction of the student 
body.ltsecmslhat The Peopk's Voice, 
and those it represents, must pose 
some kind of lhrealto the system. 

So the GUIlrdian prints editorials 
like "How the KKK Views Affinna-
tive Action" and "Black History 
Month Distorts Black History." 
Chang chose to don a "little, yellow.

last article, he stated "Readers are en-
couraged to tune in next week as let-
ters pour in ..... But we have better 
things to do with our time. L like all 
of my SIaff, am IClively involved in 
revolutionizing this university and 
community. Chang would know this 
if he bothered to ask Illy of us about 
our opinions or activities personally, 
rather than making erroneous assump-
tions. But I suppose that he believes, 
as stated in his article on the KKK and 
affirmative action, "the last thing we 
want is open dialogue between our 
people and the colored." 

Chang must lack ideas for editori -
als since he chose to focus on an "un-
read" newspaper. Allow me to sug-
gest ideas for opinion articles that 

walls are covered with anti-abortion 
paraphernalia; religious items fill the 
shelves: "Give yourself unto God; he 
is your Savior ...... One side of the store 
celebrates the United States' military 
might and how it has protected the 
equality that so truly exists in our 
country. The other side seeks to lower 
taxes on the rich. privatize health care 
and education. end affirmative action 
and put a cap on immigration. 

The "open-minded" left-wing stu-
dents at UCSD surely would RO( stand 
for that. There is no way they would 
pay money to buy a book whose re-
ceipt blared out the words "Abortion 
kills'" No way in hell. But when the 

moment they could be the victim 
of a hate crime? 

The National Guard came in , 
the power relations were returned

In the end, though, we must give 
Groundwodc a fair chance. After all,

Reginald Denny is portrayed as 
such a tragic figure. It wasn't sup-
posed to happen to him. 

In 1996, it goes without say-
ing that no one should be ran-
domly attacked for his race, gen-
der, sexuality or religion. But we 
still have not demonstrated the 
courage to address such power in-
equalities which encourage hate 
crimes. For those who see hate 

self to be, please enlighten us with 
your opinion on subjects that have a 
pertinent effect on the students and 
staff at this university.

stepped inside, it still remains a quaint

The closest it has come to the revo-

though some of us actually appreci-
ated their closing). But I still pity those 
who actually have to go inside.

The function played by hate

in lieu of submilling its own pro-
posal. 

However, certain SDSC em-
ployees said reconciliation was 
unlikely because the UCSD·GA 
conflict is rooted in the differ-
ences between academia and cor-
porate America. 

Merry Maisel, a to-year-veteran 
science writer at SDSC, said she 
suspects GA 's first concern is intel-
lectual-property rights to future 
projects. 

"They are business people who 
want to get a lock on the future," 
Maisel said. 

CHARGES: 
Shadab seeks 
invalidation 
Continued from pale 1 
tutes a clear breach of A.S. election 
bylaws. 

"There is a definite advantage of 
having yourslate 's name under your 
name," Shadab said. "It brings to-
gether all the advertising you have 
done before and brings it to a focal 
point, and gives you that last little 
advantage." 

"I was one guy up against 17 
people, a juggernaut slate," Shadab 
said, in reference to the slate Stu-
dents First!, which completed a near 
sweep of last week's elections. "I 
really had no hopes and I didn't 
think I was going to win .... Very 
early on in the campaign I gave up." 

Shadab justified his move seek-
ing an invalidation of the elections 
as a gesture based on the principle 
that independent candidates be af-
forded as many benefits as those 
who are members of a slate. 

"At this point, it's not even about 
avenging my loss .... I don't want to 
sound like a biller loser," Shadab 
said. "It·s really about having Ihe 
elections be more balanced for the 
independent candidates." 

"An independent candidate 
should feel that [he] can run inde-
pendently and still have a good 
chance to win," he added. "One 
shouldn't feel forced to join a slate 
because that's the only. way to 
win." 

Marshall Sophomore Senator 
Andrea Santos was the only inde-
pendent candidate to be elected dur-
ing last week's A.S. elections.

and not just sell ing stuff - not that 
either is good or bad," Braun said. 
"[But] the combination of academic 
and business mindsets doesn't nec-
essarily work. Sometimes you can 
honor the different interests, but nOI 
here." 

SDSC's potentially rocky fu-
ture has led several of its competi-
tors to move in and offer jobs to 
unhappy employees. Braun was 
lured away by Teledesic, a Wash-
ington-based telecommunications 
firm. 

"I was content with what I was 
doing," Braun said. "If this bicker-
ing between UCSD and GA hadn ' t 
happened, I wouldn't have left. II 
wasn't necessarily the reason, but 
the final trigger."

Within the past year, Founding 
Director Sid Karin, Executive Di-
rector Peter Arzberger, Director of 
Research Wayne Pfeiffer, Manager 
of Information Services Stephanie 
Sides. Programmer/Analyst Jeff 
Winkler and Braun have all left the 
center. 

Pew ill, who served as acting di-
rector between Karin's departure and 
Duke 's arrival, will reportedly stay 
at SDSC as chief operating officer. 

Although Braun said he found 
Pewitt to be "professional and po-
lite," another employee said confi-
dentially that some SDSC workers 
are upset thaI Pewitt will remain at 
the center. 

" I guess we figured that after a 
new director was hired, [Pewi.u] 
would just sort of vanish," the em-
ployee said.

are comparing the recent 
crossover success of pop-
punk Australian trio, 
Ammonia, with that of its 

Epic labelmate, Silverchair. How-
ever, in an interview with the 
Guardian, Ammonia's lead singer 
and guitarist Dave Johnstone said 
the similarities "end" with their 
Australian roots and common 
record label. According to John-
stone, Ammonia's background is 
"distinctly pop - not that Seattle 
music." 

The band recently broke 
through radio airplay in the United 
States with the single, "Drugs," 
off its debut album, Mint 400.

Johnstone: Perth really, literal-

world. It's about 3,000 miles from 
the next city. In between, there's 
just desen. It's a tiny, tiny little 
town. It's really pretty, kind of 
relaxed, but it's gOl a good music

late-80s pop-ish music scene. We 
kind of took off from there; and 
when we got popular, people said 
thaI we sounded very "Perth." 
We're proud of coming from 
there. I miss it when I go away; 
but we're on tour, and we just gol

-***** 

Repelilion, Unwound 's fifth 
album in as many years on the 
Ki II Rock Stan. label, depart~ 
from the explosIve punk ~ound 
of the OlympIa trio's pasl work 

The band maintains its unpar-
alleled · Inten~ lI y, however, l:om-
bining despondent voca ls with 
hard-hilling drum beats, caustic 
guitar chords and feedback. 

On the Repelilion album, the 
band experiments with a new 
ound thal includes piano, organ, 

synthe izer, vibes, wind-c himes, 
saxophone , spontaneous noise 
freakouts and a "dub" song. 
Such variation supports 
Unwound's development of ten-
sion on the album, achieved 
through cgntrolled chaos. 

Overall, Unwound invents an 
exquisile sound which is pierc-
ing yet elegant on Repetilion.

Unwn tlen Law takes a very 
apathetic appruach to music.

Lyrically, Unwritten Law is 
unsure of itself. Its anempt at 
political commentary only fills 
up space, and its songs about 
love and sex are written in the 
tradition of the incredibly trite. 

Unwritten Law's real 
trength lies in its ability to play 

complex melodies. Songs like 
"The Legend of Johnny and

what the band can accomplish 
when they care enough.

Girls Against Boys 
House of GVSB 
Touell n' Go IIlCwd. 

-***, 

Girls Against Boys' usage of 
two bass guitars sets the deep, 
throaty tone for the entire album. 
The addition of lead-singer and 
guitarist Scott McCloud 's sonic 
playing and laid-back vocals 
resu lts in a tight, but somewhat 
sedated, groove which harnesses 
the lIstener's unention. 

Two gems on the band's third 
relcase are "Cra h 17," a guitar-
driven track which sounds like 
early Offspring; and "Disco' Six 
Six Six," where keyboardist Eli 
Janney lays down a smoky 
groove which the rest of the 
band fills in nicely. 

At times, House oJ GVSB 
gets overly sluggish and mired 
in it's own sound. Songs such as 
"Life in Pink" and "TheKin-
daMzkYouLike" sound almost 
as if your stereo is on the fritz. 
This quicksand approach does 
work at times, most dramatically 
on ('Vera Cruz," a slow, sonic 
jam which settles the listener 
into the back of his couch.

The Wailers 
Jah Message 

liAS II .... 

-** 

In the late 60s and early 70s, 
the Wailers was a band far ahead 
of its time. As the back-up group 
to Bob Marley, the Wailers revo-
lutionized reggae music and pro-
duced such timeless albums as as 
"Catch a Fire. " 

However. rece nt attempts by 
reggae anists to advance with the 
times have failed for the most 
part, and the Wailers ' newest 
R.A.S. Records release, Jah Mes-
sage, is no exception. 

The group, although incredibly 
talented, fails to bring its past 
musical genius into the studio. 
Led by Aston "Family Man" Bar-
ret and Junior Marvin, the Wailers 
shy away from the sound for 
which it has become famous . The 
group instead chooses to incorpo-
rate keyboards and a synthesized 
string section - a weak attempt at 
keeping with the times. 

Marvin is responsible for lead 
vocals ; and although he has 
incredible potential , the lyrical 
content leaves the listener won-
dering exactly how much time he

devoted to songwriting. NOI much 
can be said in support of lyrics 
like, "Everything is going right! 
Everything is out of sight," or "Jah 
love has got the power .... Jah love 
is like a tower." 

The backbone of this album, as 
in all reggae, is the rhythm. In this 
respect, the Wailers retains some 
of the rock-reggae glory from its 
roots . With the work of the 
always-reliab le bassist Barrell , 
and contribution from such great 
drummers as Sly Dunbar and 
Leroy "Horsemouth" Wallace, the 
rhythm is definitely the highlight 
of the album. 

Although di fferent strains of 
reggae - dancehall and dub, for 
example - have progressed and 
flouri shed with the times, reggae 
in its purest form was unable to 
make the transition. Newer rcggae 
leaves listeners with high expecta-
tions and disappointing selections. 

Some recent bands, such as 
Culture, the Gladiators and Israel 
Vibration, release strong albums 
but pften fall victim to the unnec-
essary urge of adding synthesizers 
and other so-called modem orna-
mentation. 

As such, there are only two 
options for reclaiming the quality 
of reggae. The artists must either 
recognize and rec laim the lime-
lessness of the music from their 
heyday, or they must make a 
smoother transition into modern-
izing their sound. 

Jah Message exemplifies reg-
gae's inability to break new 
ground. Instead, it tosses itself 
onto the stagnating pile of failed 
recent reggae albums.

Hate Riots in France 
Kassovitz portrays savage accounts of 

suroival in French inner-city 
By Dill Ok .. 

Stl!Jff~er 
French director and screenplay 

writer Mathiew Kasso-
vilZ's lateSl film, aptly 
entitled Hate (fA 
Haine), is an intensely 
provocative, even sav-
age account of three 
youths' survival in the 
French cite (the French 
name for what Ameri-
cans call "the hood"). 

Set in the outskirts of Paris 
among the housing projects, Hare 
follows the series of events set 
over 24 hours following a major 
riot SlOpped only by police brutal-
ity, in which one Arab youth is 
arrested and seve.rely beaten while 
in custody. While this is just busi-
ness as usual in the cite, this time 
a .44 Magnum is lost by the 
police. only to fall into the posses-
sion of Vinz (Vincent Cassel), a 
close friend of the police force 's 
latest victim. This same weapon 
conlinuously proves to effect the 
lives of these three youths during 
these critical 24 hours - leadi~g 
to a climax that is as inevitable as 
it is tragic and janing. 

The ties that bind these three 
close friends serve as an interest-
ing contrast to their radically dif-

ferent backgrounds. Vinz is both 
white, as well as Jewish, and 
aspires to avenge his dying friend 

by the old credo of "an 
eye for an eye." 

He intends to take 
the life of a policeman 
in retribution, using the. 
very weapon the French 
police force provided 
him with. Sayid is an 
Arab with the closest 
ties to the latest victim 

of the police force ; and Huben is a 
black who acts as the moral center 
of the group - he strives to climb 
his way out of the hood to a better 
life. 

The world in whiclJ these three 
friends live is one of utter nihilism 
where most youth have no ambi-
tions or aspirations, and in the 
end, no hope for the future . Few 
bother to funher their education, 
seeing no point in even trying to 
improve on their lOIS. Instead the 
k.ids hang out in packs on rooftops 
and in parks smoking buds, only 
working occasionally. The "work" 
usually consisting of making 
minor drug deals for pushers high-
er up in the underground hierar-
chy. 

True to its name, Hate does an 
exemplary job of portraying the 

manner in which hatred, whether 
it be directed racially, ethnically 
or against the system in general, is 
a vicious cycle of self-perpetua-
tion. 

I! remains uncertain whether 
more despair may be unearthed 
from the reality of so little being 
done to staunch the flow of perse-
cution within the projects; or that 
attempts made by the few who try 
to stop the vicious cycle result in 
linle more than lessons in futility. 

Although the story takes place 
in Paris, the strong presence of 
American culture and violence 
enforces the probability that such 
aspects and societal problems are 
more univeJ:Sll1 than the public 
may be lead to believe. 

However, the film never 
becomes self-indulgent and con-
sistently remains grounded in a 
bleak reality that is shocking more 
for its honesty than the consistent 
occurrences of violence. 

Other factors, such as the 
effective use of the black-and-
white medium, consistent "time 
announcements," as well as the 
inclusion of the large amounts of 
empty time present within the 
Ii ves of the youth, all add to the 
realism and poignancy of the 
film's message.

B"I'llfll\ys 
Local punk bands play Che Cafe benefit 

Clikatal Dcatowi and Calabash 
Case, two local punk bands played 
the Che Caf6 last Friday to benefit 
the Sound 

the interest of anyone in attendance. 
The group's expertly played brand 
of punk music, which draws inspi-

ration from 
Ambition -
IYouth 

CLIKATAT IKATOWI political and 
cerebral 

lnfonned collective. The main "draw 
of the evening, was definitely 
Clikatat Ikatowi, whose fiercely 
loyal fan base comprised the major-
ity of the attendees. 

Clikatat Dcatowi opened its 45-
minute-long set with a provisional 
hom seclion which generated a 
.;acophonous but engaging backdrop 
for the singer's spoken introduction. 

Although the vocals at a live 
show are always difficult to make 
out, the wild antics of the lead 
singer combined with the drum-
mer's fast· paced, solid percussion 
work add more than enough to hold 

I, 

AMMONIA: 
Band with pop 
Continued from.,... H8 
In MY WIY? 

Of all the comparisons made, 
the only ones I see are that we're 
both from Australia [and] both 
from the same label. That's pretty 
much where our similarities end. 
They're a lot younger, and they 
grew up listening to Seattle stuff. 
We grew up to the pop music com-
ing out of Penh. We even listen to 

sources, is highly original - a 
commendable feat considering it 
hails from San Diego. 

Catching Clikatal has proved to ~ 
be quile difficult recently, as it is 
largely a word-of-mouth band 
Speculation is that Cli~taI will 
soon take a hiatus from performing, 
while writing new music, practicing 
with its new band member and will 
possibly return with a new moniker. 
It will also be ditching its word-of-
mouth mode of publicity. which 
could make the band more accessi-
ble in the future. 

- Rebecc. Hal 

different stuff than they do. But we 
get along really well with the Sil-
verchair guys, we're not competi-
rive with them or anything. 
Where cId )'ou ' &at the Idu 
for MOnrp"7 , 

I wrote that little riff before 
rehearsal, and when I played it, the 
other guys thought it sounded son of 
like a Velvet Underground song. So 
from that, we got all this stuff and 
this influence about drugs, prosti-
tutes, money .... It took off from one 
or two minutes, and people seemed 
to like it. It's pretty catchy stuff.

Fat, Happy and 
Proud of it 

Many athletes today are 
getting into trouble - either 
they are running afoul of the 
law while partying with topless 

- dancers in cheap hotel rooms. 
or they're using green-died 
coiffs to headbutt hapless little 
referees. Whatever the reason 
for these mishaps, the overall 
pattern reveals much about the 
p yches of our troubled 
gladiators. They aren't happy 
campefS. As luck would have 
it. I can propose a solution 
guaranteed to put a smile on 
their faces and a lippy-lap song 
in their hearts: They need to 
get fat. 

America has a distinguised 
history of happy fat men 
competing in professional 
sports. often being met with 
great success and wild 
popularity. The fat boys are 
always charming the masses 
with big smiles on their faces 
and cheeseburgers and beers in 
their bellies. The rotund guy in 
athletic conte ts is never the 
one who gets tossed from a 
game as the result of a big 
brawl. nor is he called for a 
"T' because he yelled at a ref. 
He's just the happy guy 
dreaming of doing well enough 
to get a McDonald 's com mer-

, J. cia l - so he can cat all those 
free Big Macs during the shool. 

Just take a cursory glance at 
all the beloved fat boys in 
professional sports today. 
Baseball and football have the 
fa ttest of the fat men. Tony 
Gwynn and Fernando 

•• Valenzuela of the Padres, Big 
Cecil Fielder of the Tigers and 
just about any catcher in the 
majors ~ all popular fat guys. 
Every offensive lineman and 
most defensive linemen in the 
NFL fall into thl ~ illustrious 
catagory. the most notable 
being ~ate Newton of the 
Cowboys and Jerry Ball of the 
Raiders. John Madden - an 
affable big fella in his own 
right - has made a living

of professional linemen on his 
chalkboard and showing the 
big men running and giggling

look at the player many people 
claim was the greatest. most

I Birk·'s Bombs 
Blast Baptist 
TATERS: Craig Birk 
put on a power display 
on Monday, smashing 
three home runs 
By Sean Rahlml 
Associate Sports Editor 

Ceci l FielderandCraig Birk may 
not seem to have much in common 
- one is a major leaguer weighing 
350 pounds, and the other is a 
considerably trimmer athlete 
for the UCSD baseball team, 
but one gets paid thousands of 
dollars each day by the base-
ball owners. and the other pays 
thousands each year to the UC 
regents. 

However. last week, the 
two had a lot in common, as both 
accomplished a spectacular feat : 
Birk and Fielder each crushed three 
home runs in a single game. Fielder 
did it in Toronto on Tuesday. while 
Birk's performance at Triton Base-
ball Stadium on Monday carried the 
Tritons to their second-straight vic-
tory. knocking off Cal Baptist, 8-3. 

Birk 's performance started in-
nocently enough. as he singled home 
the initial run in the first inning. 
Lead-off hitter David Myers opened 
the Triton half of the inning by draw-
ing a walk and stealing econd base. 
Jason Aguilar continued hi s hot hit -
ting by lacing a single to left field . 
moving Myers to third. Birk then 
followed by crushing the next offer-

ing from losing pitcher Darren Mai 
into center field for his first RBI of 
the contest. 

In the third inning, Bir\( came up 
to the plate with the Lancers leading 
3-2. thanks to home runs from Dan 
Bergmanand Ramsey Altwaiji. Birk 
changed things quickly, however. 
blasting Mai 's 2-2 delivery overthe 
right-field wall. 

"It was a two-strike pitch 'and a 
little up," Birk said. "He made 
a mistake. and I tried to capi-
talize on it ." 

The senior from Los Al-
tos hit two more moon shots 
in the fifth and seventh in-
nings, putting UCSD up for 
good in the bottom half of 
the fifth. Aguilar reached 

base on an error, and Birk promptly 
drove him in with a missile over 
the right-field wall, which never 
made it 20 feet off the ground 
during its entire flight. Of course, 
this shot was small in comparison 
to hi third bomb. 

The Lancers' Bergman came in 
to relieve Mai in the seventh inning. 
Birk stepped up to the plate and took 
the first two pitches inside. Doing 
hi s best imitation of "Big Cecil." the 
Triton designated-hitter spanked 
Bergman's third offering so hard 
the Lancer right-fielder never 
moved. He simply turned his head 
to see just how far beyond the fence 
the home run would travel. Birk 
followed his epic blast, one which

would have made Cecil proud, with 
his third home run trot of the game 
-except thatBirk's was a bit faster. 

"I told him to relax his swing a 
little because normally when you 
hit a ball so hard. you tend to 
overswing a little in the next one." 
Triton Head Coach Robert Fletcher 
said. 

In relief of UCSD starting 
pitcher Marc Abrams. freshman 
southpaw John Gherini took over 
in the fifth and pitched well enough 
to' pick up his first co llegiate vic-
tory. Pitching a flawless two and 
two-thirds of an inning, the hard-
throwing left- hander held his own 

in his debut. 
"I was just trying to do my 

job," Gherini said. " I got to pinch 
hit a couple of times earlier in the 
season; but I felt pretty good throw-
ing today , so we ' ll see what hap-
pens." 

Set-up man John Titchen came 
into the contest in the seventh in-
ningwith two runners on base. "J.T." 
filled in perfectly. getting Lancer 
Scott Payne to ground out to third-
baseman Chuck Johnson for the third 
out. Titchen pitched a flawless eighth 
and Andy DeGrasse preserved the 
victory for UCSD, pitching a score-
less ninth.

Menzel shook off her nagging hand

with a huge double down the left-

field line which brought in pinch-runner Sarah
