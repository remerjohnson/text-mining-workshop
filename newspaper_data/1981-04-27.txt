Improve AS with 
new constitution 
Editor: 

I commend A.G. Webb for 
his well·reasoned article 
(GlUlrdian, April 20) and his 
attempt to get us all to "first 
discuss the basics" of what 
we want in a student 
government. His first 
criterion is crucial: that the 
student government "repre· 
sent all the students." How 
this problem is addressed will 
determine the future succes 
of any new constitution 
which comes out of the 
convention process. 

No student government 
will be effective or 
meaningful until it begins to 
attract the support of the 
student body at large. As 
students, the most effective 
weapon we have for 
achieving our political goals 
is our numbers - our ability 
to oonoentrate our demands 
through a loud collective 
voice. Student government 
will be an irrelevant political 
organi~tion as long as it fails 
to obtain the mass support of 
the student body. And it will 
always fail to obtain that 
support until it resolves the 
fundamental lack of 
representativeness in the 
current Associated Students 
structure. Until students feel 
that the student government 
reflects their priorities, they 
will fail to take an active 
interest in it. And rightfully 
so. Why get involved with a 
student government which 
does not reflect our primary 
reason for being here? 

I contend that the 
overwhelming concern of the 
vast majority of students is 
straightforward and easily 
ascertained: academics. If 
our goal is a truly 
representative student 
government, why not select 
ret»resentatives in away that 
reflects our primary concern? 
This is why the contitution I 
have proposed calls for 
representation by academic 
major. 

But this is by itself not 
wholly adequate. And here I 
must correct Mr. Webb, who 
seemed to indicate that my 
proposal substituted for 
college representation. My 
proposal would actually 
expand college representa' 
tion. This is essential both 

for providing a way of 
representing the large 
numbers of students who 
have not chosen a major and 
for continuing a form of 
represen tation that has 
traditionally reflected a 
major source of identity for 
studen ts (particularly for 
freshperson and sopho· 
mores, whom also tend to be 
the ones who have not chosen 
a major). 

Maybe the particular 
methods I have chosen to 
select representatives are not 
the most equitable or the 
most workable. I remain open 
to all ideas for improving my 
proposal. I have yet to see, 
however, a proposal that 
fully addresses the problem 
of creating a representative 
selection process for the 
student ~overnment. And 
this critenon should be first 
and foremost in our minds 
when we discuss the basics, 
as it is for A.G. Webb. 

Only through creative 
solutions to the problem of 
"representing all the 
students" can we put a stop 
to the process whereby 
student government becomes 
the tool of a small clique 
(which dominates proceed· 
ings and reaps the greatest 
financial rewards). This 
process destroyed the 
Student Cooperative Union 
several years ago and has 
destroyed the AS now. More 
and more, many fine 
students get turned off by the 
senseless bickering of self· 
aggrandizing political 
opportunists. These students 
drop out of the government 
process, leavin~ the 
politicos' and Junior 

bureaucratstofiihtamongst 
themselves as U\ey become 
increasingly alienated from 
the great mass of student 
concerns and become 
increasingly isolated. This 
cyclical pattern is a function 
of the un·representative 
selection processes that both 
the Coop and the current AS 
utilize. We need a bold step 
away from those selection 
processes. I claim LhaL 
academic major representa' 
tion provides that step. But if 
you have a better method, I 
encourage you to present it at

UCSB offers escort 
Editor: 

Concerning the escort 
service at UCSD which I'm 
told has recently folded, 
resulting in a severe hazard 
to those travelling alone after 
dark, I feel the committee 
investigating a replacement 
service should be aware of 
the Community Service 
Organization , a student 
organization at UC Santa 
Barbara. 

We are 38 st udents 
working as a civilian 
extension of the UCSB Police 

Department: every day from 
10 am to 6 am, two CSO's 
I>3trol the campus on bicycle. 
We fulfill many funcitons; 
the most important here is 
that we are available during 
all hours of darkness to 
escort people who would 
otherwise be walking or 
riding alone. We carry radios 
for immediate contact with 
the police department , we 
wear yellow shirts for 
visibility, we are trained in 
first aid and CPR and we 
function as an information 

and referral service. 
The CSO is a respected 

part of this campus, and we 
would be happy to furnish 
your campus with further 
mformation, should it be of 
help in restoring an escort 
service. Reach us at 805·961 ·

Keep Up the good coverage 
Editor: 

The article, "The Herpes 

tlay Infectious Rock 'n' Roll" Guardian, April 20) , opefully is a sign of future 
GlUlrdian coverage of UCSD 
bands that has been needed 
for a long time. 

There are many student 
bands here at UCSD with 
great talent to offer, which 
have gone unrecognized due 
to lack of exposure. The noon 

concerts at Revelle are a great 
source for student bands to 
perform, and should be 
continued. Further, the 
Guardian could help the 
situation by providing equal 
coverage for many of these 
bands as they have done in 
the Herpes article. 

As a member of a UCSD 
band, Steel Breeze, I feel that 
the GlUlrdian would be an 
exc:eJlent source for publicity 

of all of the bands that 
perform on campus. We have 
received very pos itive 
reactions from many 
students wherever we play, 
indicating a strong student 
interest in campus bands. 
This definite interest of 
UCSD students should be 
served by better coverage in 
the Guardian.

State elections a circus 
MAXWELL GLEN and 

CODY SHEARER 
WASHINGTON - Make 

way for the circus. The most 
entertaining political 
campai~ in years is about to 
unfold m California. 

The 1982 Senate race for 
incumbent Republican Sam 
Hayakawa's seat is already 
intriguing Hollywood 
producers because of its 
situation·comedy possibili· 
ties. 

There's a star·studded cast 
of contenders, including 
Repu blican congressmen 
Barry Goldwater Jr., Robert 
K . Dornan and Pete 
McCloskey, first daughter 
Maureen Reagan, as well as 
Democrat ic Gov . Jerry 
Brown. 

But the most improbable 
contender of all is novelist 
Gore Vidal. 

During his only previous 
attempt for political office, in 
1960, New York congression· 
al candidate Gore Vidal never 
let his audiences doze off. On 
daily tours of church halls, 
women's clubs and cocktail 
parties, Vidal would begin his 
standard stump speech by 
discu ssing whether Liz 
Taylor was happily married 
to Eddie Fisher, or whatJack 

Parr was "really like off 
camera." 

Vidal would then abruptly 
change his course and 
advocate the recognition of 
Communist China, federal 
aid to education and a 
reduction in the Pentagon 's 
budget . . Such behavior was 
then, and still is, uncharac-
teristic for a politician. 

During the early 1970s, 
Vidal ioined other discon· 
tented Democrats in forming 
the People's Party, which 
nominated a reluctant Dr. 
Benjamin Spock to run for 
the presidency in 1972. 

Vidal's quick wit has 
repeatedly gotten him into 
trouble with colleagues. In 
the last 15 years, both 
William F. Buckley and 
Norman Mailer have nearly 
thrown punches at him on 
national television. 

And there's no guarantee 
that his contender in the 
Democratic primary, Jerry 
Brown, will be safe from 
Vidal's sharp tongue. 

"Jerry's turned himself 
into a ptofessional politi· 
cian," Vidal told us in a 
telephone interview from 
London. "He does these crazy 
dances around every subject, 
trying to appeal to everybody 

and ends up a~pealing to no 
one. I mean he s in trouble. 

"If I were Jerry, " he 
continued, "I would take four 
years off and I'd sit down and 
I'd read books and I'd think 
thoughts and I'd figure out 
who I am. Once I knew that, 
then I'd go." 

Vidal won't declare his 
candidacy "for another 
couple of months," but he's 
already telli~ reporters to 
look for htm "on the 
hustings." And we've learned 
that liberal fund·raisers are 
already sounding out 
potential backers who might 
contribute toward the $2 
million needed for his 
primary war chest. 

The novelist is running to 
"stop the drift toward war. 
There's a real war spirit in 
the land ... you know, 25 
percent of our federal budget 
goes to the Pentagon and 
Reagan will have it up to a 
third by 1983." 

ThouJdl Vidal 's erudition 
isn't likely to appeal to 
voters, Brown's aides aren 't 
taking any chances. The 
Brown for Senate committee 
has already filed with the 
Federal Election Commission 
and plans to raise $1.5 m\lIion

US foreign policy moves to the south 
BY JOHN STEWART Pentagon forming an explosive alliance? expenditure which will result in a one·third increase 

of the total US fleet, much of 
which is de tined for the 
Indian Ocean; the continuing 
build· up of the $1 billion 
Rapid Deployment Force; the 
e tablishment of six 
permanent US military bases 
10 and near the Persian Gulf; 
and the creation of a 1.500· 
man US " peace·keeping" 
force in the Sinai. 

The little·noted confluence 
of recent foreign military 
visitors to Washington -
including delegations from 
previously untouchable 
South Africa, Argentina, 
Chile and Brazil - ha 
renewed old speculations 
about a long di credited US 
military policy. These 
visitor, a number of whom 
arrived simultaneou Iy ,

the Pentagon may again be 
pursuing a radical. all · 
embracing "resource 
defense" policy involving a 
Roten tially explosi ve 
'alliance" between the US, 

NATO, South Africa and 
South America. 

The sticking point in such

an alliance is the South 
African connection . given 
that government's racist 
apart heid policies which 
were shunned by the Carter 
Administration . But South 
Africa is aloes ential to 
uch planning because of its 

huge naval por t and 
sophisticated surveillance 
and communications system 
at Simonstown. 

The goal of the strategy is 
to secure the free flow of 
Western·bound Persian Gulf 
oil through the Indian Ocean 
and South Atlantic, as well as 
to guarantee Western acce 
to the rich "Gulf of Minerals" 
in southern Afri ca, the 
source of nearly 90 percent of 
the West ' s essential 
minerals. 

The strategy, which has 

evolved among independent 
analyst over the pas t 
decade, involves three clo ely 
related component . The 
first is to extend US and 
NATO ea and ground forces 
into the Persian Gulf area 
and the Indian Ocean, with 
access to Simons town. The 
second component would 
involve creation of an alliance 
of the so·called "outlaw 
tates" of the South Atlantic. 

This "South Atlantic T reaty 
Organization" (SATO), a 
southern cousin of NATO. 
would include South Africa , 
Argentina, Chile and possibly

Bagneris, Harris wartn up for 
caDlpaign asking for respect 
Both see it as good for AS, but see each other 
as 'too limited' in perspective to do a good job 

BY JEFF BERESFORD· HOWE 
News Editor 

Joshua Harris and Jules Bagneris have 
defined their positions for the upcoming AS 
presidential run-uff - and neIther seems 
worried about excessively flattering the other. 

"A lot of (Harri ' campaign) i a single issue, 
like programming. I'm in favor of that, but it's 
not the only thing the AS can do," Bagneris 
says. Harris is AS Programming 
Commissioner. 

"I saw a suggestion fromlules that TG's be 
more 'cultural.' I don ' t think that he's 
answering to a good majority of the students," 
Harris says of Bagneris, the first Black 
candidate to make an AS presidential run·off. 

Both are planning campaigns that will 
emphasize "more of the same." For both, that 
means ~ing door to door in the dorms, posting 
flyers (Bagneris said his get ripped down 
Quickly) and meeting people on the plaza. 

But it will not apparently mean a 
confrontation. ' 

Bagneris said yesterday he has challenged 
Harris to a debate sometime this week, but 
Harris told the Guardian he won't do it. 

"I'd rather not, for two reasons. One is that 
there was a crowd of only about 10 (sic) at the 
last one, so a debate won't help any because 
there'll be a small crowd. There is just not 
enough noti<,:e, so P,f!>'ple ~on't get out and vote 
or come to hsten, HarrIS says. 

"They can read more about it in the 
newspaper. " 

Both see the campaign's main issue as 
restoring respect to the AS, and each is 
convinced of his own superior ability to do 
that. "I want people to write letters to the 
Guardian saying what a good job the AS is 
doing," Harns said. 

"We (Bagneris' slate) have the possibility of 

bringing some leadership to effect change on a 
lot of issues facing the campus, state-wide and 
otherwise," Bagneris says. "The AS has to 
deal with direct benefits to students." 

Harris agrees - to a point. 
"The number one priority of the AS has to 

be programming issues," he says. " Working to 
improve programming, and especially the 

intercolle~iate and intramural athletics 
programs. 

Harris uses the same phrase as Bagneris -
"direct benefits to students" - but has a 
different rule for determining what they are. 

"We should not completely rule out (non· 
programming activities), but we should de· 
emphasize non·direct student services." 

Asked for an example of such a service, he 
suggests the Student Lobby, an $8,000 "non· 
direct student service." 

Harris also says he wasn't surprised at the 
student vote endorsjng UC Regental 
investment in South Africa. 

"There are so many more important things 
to worry about on campus .. . we re too young a 
school to spend our time on those things," he 
says. 

Bagneris has a more traditional attitude to 
the campaign - he thinks it's "important to 
have a legitimate AS, and let students inform 
other students about campus issues." 

His "Respect with Perspective" slate has 
emphasized AS solvency, so that it can have 
an effect on political issues. 

"We need a strong AS to initiate changes 
(for the betterment of the humanities and 
social sciences) and struggle to see them 
implemented," he said in responding to the 
Guardian questionnaire two weeks ago. 

"We cannot afford ineffective leadership."

US foreign policy' 
move to the south 
continued from page 3 
their s trategy with other 
" regional powers ." South 
Afr!ca, of course, is the only 

r~<?~aI power .of military 
slfnJflcance astnde Africa 's 
oi ·shipping sea lanes. 

While the four Western 
groups which prepared the 
report are not official bodies, 
they often reflect the official 
foreign policy thinking in 
their respective govern· 
ments . Indeed, British Prime 
Minister Margaret Thatcher 
subsequently spoke out in 
support of the recommenda· 
tions in the report, and US 
deputy Defense Secretary 
Frank Carlucci has explicitly 
warned European govern· 
ments that Washington 
alone, "cannot bear th~ 

~urden of protecting Western 
!nter~s~ beyond Europe," 
ImpliCItly suggesting a 
NATO role in the sea lanes 
defense. 

The second as pect of the 
overall stratey, the " SATO" 
scenario , is far more 
speculative. The creation of a 
SATO ha s long been 
advocated by some conserva· 
tive US military strategists , 
clu s tered around the 
Wa hington·ba ed American 
Security C o un c il an 
independent think·tank' with 
close ties to the Reagan 
Administration . These 
strategists argue that the 
}!incipal naval powers of the 
:South Atlantic - South 
Africa, Argentina, Brazil and 
Chile - should coordinate 
their individual defense 
efforts in much the way 
NATO coordinates US and 
European defense. Similarly, 
the SATO and NATO 
maritime policies should be 
c~rdinated , even though 
thIS would necessariy involve 
NATO cooperation with 
South Africa. 

Besides the strategic 
importance of the South 
Atlantic sea lanes , US 
strategists also point out that 
the South Atlantic region is 
itself rich in oil, fish and 
scarce minerals. Three of the 
principal powers - South 
Africa, Argentina and Brazil 
- are, or soon will be, 
nuclear powers. And the 
Brazilians ar e qui c kl y 
building their own navy 
which now includes a fleet of 
11 submarines which can 
patrol the 2,OOO'mile gap 
between Recife and West 
Africa . 

That the Reagan Admini· 
stration may now actively be 
encouraging such an alliance 
is pure supposition. But there 
have been some suggestive 
signs. During the election 
campaign, Lt. Gen . Daniel 
Graham, the former director 
of the Defense Intelligence 
Agency and a Reagan advisor 
on defe n se, t ra veled to 
Argentina and s poke out 
direct ly in upport of a South 
Atlan tic a lliance . Ge n . 
Graham is a lso closely 
connected to t he American 
Secur it y Counci l , w h ich 
many in Was hington believe 
wa responsible for inviting 
the fi ve Sou t h A r ican 
military intelligence officer 
to Washington in mid ·March. 

Curious ly , the controver· 
s ial vis it by South African , 
who were treated to a 
meeting with UN Amba a· 
dor Jeane Kirkpatri c k , 
coincided with the Wa hin~· 
ton vi it of Argentina 
Pre ident·de ignate, General 

Roberto Viola. 
Other recent high·ranking 

military delegations in 
Washington included the 
head of the Chilean Air Force 
and the Brazilian chairman 
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff . 
Whether any of these 
delegations met with others 
is not known, but the 
warming up of US relations 
to all of the regimes is clear. 
The Carter Administration's 

s~cti<?ns poli<:y on Chile is 
being hfted, as IS the arms aid

reportedly now seeking some 
$100 million worth of US

US policy toward South 
Africa itself has been evident 
iI. recent remarks by 
President Reagan, who asked 
in a March 3 interview with 
Walter Cronkite if the US 
could "abandon" a "friendly, 
nation like South Africa' 
which, he noted, "strategical· 
ly is essential to the free 
world. It has production of 
minerals wt. all must have 
and so forth." 

If the Reagan Administra· 
tion insis ts that it is still 
"reviewing" its policy 
toward South Africa, the 
South African ~hemselves 
are firmly convinced that 
they have a new friend in 
Nashington.

Vidal probably won't win, 
but Brown aides say the 
challenge would hurt their 
candidate. It would divert 
party dollars away from vital 
voter registration and get' 
out·the·vote efforts . Some 
aides worry that Vidal might 
make Brown look vulnerable 
or hollow on the issues. 

On the contrary , Vidal 
might be good medicine for 
the fence·~trllddling Brown. 
Being his intellectual equal , 
Vidal could help the governor 
sharpen his political ideas 
which, according to some, 
have recently lost focus . 

Many liberal Californians 
are upset with Brown for

they fear Brown may soon 
appoint two conservatives to 
the state Supreme Court to 
" broaden his base." 

Should he put an organiza·

help Brown and other 
Democrats rediscover their 
princples. 

But if th e noveli s t 's 
fascination with polit icians

his ability to stake Brown out 
on the issues. And then

Spikers dotninate 
Hold off USIU in finals 

BY NANCY LEE 
The Triton Spikers came 

out of Saturday's All-League 
Volleyball Tournament with 
top honors in the six team 
match. Cal State Northridge, 
U IU, UC Riverside, and La 
Verne College competed 
against UCSD. Cal Poly San 
Luis Obsipo, which is in first 
place for the NAIA Southern 
Division did not show for the 
match. 

Tom Feuer, an outside 
hitter for UCSD, said, .. ... the 
Tritons played exceptionally 
well on Saturday. We all 
wanted the tournament for 
our coach." 

The five teams played one 
round robin, and the two 
teams with the best record 

ended the day's tourney in a 
final match. 

UCSD downed UC River-
side and La Verne College 
twice, and split matches with 
both Cal State Nort hridge 
and USIU. In order to decide 
which two schools would 
play in the fi nals they

games to 15 points. UCSD 
lost the first game but came 
back to down USIU in the 
next two, winning the match.

Women's 
softball 

• wInners 
BY BOB McSPADDEN 

Sport. Editor 
In Dan Monteverde's first 

season as coach of the 
women's softball team, he 
has managed to turn the 
Tritons' 1980 record of 1-14 
into at least a tie for first 
place in the CCAC con-
ference . 

This has not occurred 
without the help of an 
excellent team . however. 
which: has won its last three 
games with a scoring margin 
of 23 runs to the opponents 1 
run ; has allowed Loyola 
Marymount to reach not 
farther than second base in a 
1-0 victory April 17; and 
spotlights pitcher Rita Uribe 
for two shutouts in her last 
three games. giving up only 
two hits in a 14-1 trouncing of 
Point Loma College on 
Tuesday. 

The Tritons league record 
of 4-2 guarantees them at 
least a tie with Loyola 
Marymount for the league 
championships . Should 
Loyola lose either of its two 
upcoming games with Point 
Loma. UCSD would be in sole 
possess ion of firs t place and 
gain an automatic berth to 
the regionals in San t a 
Barbara. 

In the Tritons' 1-0win over 
Loyola Marymount on April 
24. Uribe pitched a no-hitter. 
facing 24 batters in seven 
innings . The following 
Tuesday Uribe shut out LA 
Baptist College. 8-0. and 
Thursday she continued her 
impressive pitching in the 14-
1 crushing of Point Loma 
College. 

In the game vs. Point Loma 
College. UCSD 's Vanessa 
Davis went 4 for 5 with one 
home-run and six runs batted 
in. 

The Tritons ' overall record 
of 7-7·1 is a pleasant 
turnaround from the 
previous two seasons. which 
saw UCSD win only two 
games and lose 27.

experience with the people on 
your team gives you an

Goldman. 

Interest in ultimate frisbee 
at UCSD is growing. "We 
expected only a few teams." 
said Scott Berndes of the 
intramural office . "We 
offered it because it's so 
popular at other UC schools 
and had great response. I 
think intramural fri sbee is 
going to become very big here 
at UCSD." Berndes said .

'Full Circle' offers food for 
thought, but is talky, turgid 

Morali ty of World War II explored 
BY MIKE THOMAS 

Are you ready for some 
good old-fashioned . didactic 
theatre? Have you recently 
said to yourself. "What I need 
is a play that will make me 
ponder moral choices 
involved during wartime and 
help me make the right 
choice?" Has it been awhile 
since you've thought about 
Jews and Nazis and World 
War II and concentration 
camps? 

Well then. have I got a play 
for you . Full Circle by Erich 
Marie Remarque. which just 
opened at the Cassius Carter 
in Balboa Park for a run 
through May 24. has all the 
ingred ients you're looking 
for. Hey. so what if it's turgid 
and talky? It is. after all guilt-
free entertainment: after 
seeing Full Circle you will be 
a superior person. So what if 
the road to boredom i paved 
with honorable intentions? 
Thi play is "heavy." man. 
Well . enough sarcasm. Sorry 
to say. but self-r ighteous 
pl atit udes coming fr om 
German writers who spent 
the war years in Hollywood 
living with Paulet te Goddard 
and then write tame little 
morality plays s tick in my 
craw. But the fault may not 
be entirely Remarque·s. the 
play was adapted from the 
German by noted hack Peter 
Stone who may have been 
responsible for the unwieldy 

dialogue. 
The plot involves an 

escaped concentration camp 
political prisoner who seeks 
refuge in a cynical woman's 
apartment (irony of ironies) 
on the day that Crazy Adolf 
offs himself. He stays with 
the woman, warming the 
cockles of her frozen heart . 
until the Russians come and 
offer him a chance to help 
create a new, socialistic 

Germany. He refu ses and i's 
led off at play's end by the 
guard and th in-'!s have come 
full circle (get itr). Ugh . . 

This kind of thing may 
have gone over ~eat in the 
50's on television s Playhouse 
90. but in t he 35 years since 
the end of the war there have 
been so many of these type of 
ventures that you get the 
feeling you 've seen it all 
before. The actors stru~le 
valiantly with what they ve 
~ot and try to inject some life 
mto the one-dimensional 
characters but you wonder if 
the effort is worth the bother. 

Malcolm Young. a gradu-
ate student in drama here at 
UCSD. looks like he's spent 
seven years i.n a conce~tra-

tion camp with his gaunt face 
and greying hair. D'Ann 
Paton Peace is properly 
weary as the woman who is 
interested only in survival. 
But. as Jean Kerr once said , 
the snake gets all the lines. 
and the neatest job of scene 
stealing is done by Anthony 
Drake as the Gestapo officer . 
Drake has all the snake-oil 
charm of an in s ur ance 
salesman pitching a policy. 
He makes the phrase. "the 
banality of evil " come alive as 
we find ourselves sympathi-
zing more for the villian than 
the earne t. ponti fi cating 
heroes. 

Laura Lankin . Navarre T . 
Perry. and Tom Kelroy are all' 
effective in the smaller roles. 
and the stagi ng by director 
William Roesch is inventive. 
But as the Bard wrote. the 
play's the thing. and this 
one 's about as much fun as an 
evening in Bar tow. If any 
author take it upon himself 
to be morally edifying. he 
hou ld at least do it with a 

sense of s tyle. wit and 
imagi n ati on . ing r edie nt s 
sadly lacking in Full Circle.

Music/Ted Burke 

'Affirmation' brings life to pub scene 
To be honest, and certainly 

not to hold anyone account· 
able, I've been generally 
unimpressed with most of 
the musical acts that've been 
booked into Walk's Pub over 
the last year and a half. Savel 
for an outstanding jazz series 
last year that spotlighted 
such stellar local musicians 
like Hollis Gentry, Joe Morillo 
and Peter Sprague's Dance of 
the Universe Orchestra 
(which I wish someone in 
charge would again initiate), 
much of the music has left me 
feeling more blase toward it 
than a gorged mouse 
regarding the last nibble of 
cheese, as in I've had my fill 
of monotonous jazz·funk 
units, whimpering folkies or 

run·of·the·mill rockers who 
think that louder is better. 
Sorry, but I've been through 
it before. 

Someone, however, must 
have sensed that I was a tad 
bit weary of the usual 
musical fare. In a burst of a 
bright idea (lightbulbs in the 
comics), this person 
unknown booked an LA jazz· 
fusion band Affirmation, 
who were, to belabor my topic 
sentence. a pleasant, even 
invigorating ' respite, like 
water thrown on your face on 
the hottest day of the year. 

Which isn't to sar that 
Affirmation were 'cool in the 
slightest. Comprised of 
musicians whose collective 
playing history includes 

tint with Frank Zappa , 
Pa sport. The Band, Jean· 
Luc Ponty and The Don Ellis 
Orche tra among man y 
others, the mu icians -
Thom Teresi on keyboards 
and synthesizers. Joe Gaeta 
on guitar, Tom Fowler on 
bass, Jimbo Ross on electric 
and accoustic viola, and Dave 
Crigger on drums - they 
provided more than their 
share of hot, flashy playing, 
but smartly twined with an 
element that escapes the 
hordes of lesser fusion 
ensembles: taste. 

That's to say that 
Affirmation's material, much 
of it by Teresi, side·steps the 
usual genre tendency to 
merely jam off speedy but

repetitious riff (a bad habit 
favored by Stanley Clarke) 
and instead develops their 
theme . Like the Dixie Dregs, 
who they re emble more than 
a little, the tunes are a 
splendid int~ration of rock 
hard dynamICs, the bitter 
sweet meloncholia if a violin 
concerto. the spritely 
pyrotechnics of Lizst and the 
smooth, qu ick·witted 
resourcefulness of hard· 
bebop. Though occasionally 
overwhelmed by the habitu· 
ally abysmal acoustics at the 
PUb. Affirmation none the 
les ucceeded in demonstra· 
ting their ability to convey an 
array of moods and 
evocations. 

Spicing up the band's 
melodic strengths were the 
capabilities of their principal 
soloists, Teresi , Gaeta and 
Ross. Teresi, the most 
mainstream in sound, would 
rip out rapid runs, creating a 
sharp but pleasing contrast 
to Ross' hard. resonatin~ 
romanticism and Gaetas 
fleet ·fingered , hard·nosed 
attacks. The solos came to a 
fever pitch on a song that 
concluded their set,with the 
trio exchanging runs in an 
exci ted rou nd·robi n of 
soloing, a kind of inspired 
three·way call and response. 

What I could have done 
without, though, was 
Crigger's extended drum 
solo. Though a very good time 
keeper and propulsive 
influence during the 
ensemble work, his outing 
lacked individual identity or 
a semblance of rhythmic 
originization, sounding 
instead like a random grab·

everything. My advice would 
be for him to make like Bill 
Buford (whose own Jazz rock 
albums are among the best

to being an influential bit of

Altogether. Affirmation 
certainly got me from my

Jazz, in one form or 

another, seems to be the by . 
word in music for late week 
UCSD entertainment. 
demonstrated by the 
Affirmation show last 
Thursday, and by last last 
Friday's noon concert on the 
gym steps by The UCSD Jazz 
Ensemble. A rather enjoyable 
way to wile away the lunch 
period. 

Under the firm hand of 
Music Department faculty 
member Jimmy Cheatem, the 
Ensemble performed the big-
band music of several great 
composers, including Count 
Basie, Duke Ellington and 
Fletcher Henderson, and 
highlighted the skills of 
several promising soloists. 
This was most evident in a 
tune called "Basically

Tay-Sachs 
tests here 
next week 

Free screening for Tay· 
Sachs disease and sickle cell 
anemia will be offered by the 
California Tay-Sachs 
Disease Prevention Program 
and Action Enterprises 
Development, from May 4 to 
7, at UCSD. 

Tay·Sachs di sease and 
s ickle cell anemia are 
incurable, geneticall y 
in herited disorders. 

Tay·Sachs disea e i fatal 
and is most common in 
Jewish children of Eastern 
European descent , however, 
its occurance i not limited to 
any racial or ethnic group. It 
is best described as a lack of 
enzyme w hich can be passed 
on to a gene carr ier's child. 
T he disease affects t he 
child's brain and nervous 
system and tran sforms 
beautifu l b a bies i n to 
physicall y and mentally 
retarded children. Life 
expectancy for these children 
is three to four years of age. 

Sickle cell anem ia is a blood 
disorder which is one of the 
mos t common long-term 
ill nesses of Black children . 
Its occurance, however, is 
also not limited to any racial 
or ethnic group. For example, 
in the Hispanic population 
the carrier rate for the 
d isorder is one in every 24 
individuals. 

A simple blood test is used 
to detect carr iers for ooth 
genetic disorders. Identified 
carriers can then seek genetic 
counsel ing pr ior t o and 
during pregnancy, for a 
heal t hier and happier 
outcome.

BY JANET COOKE 

AS P_liamentar\an 
LA JOLLA COUNTRY 

DAY SCHOOL (AP) -
Fueled by equal measures of 
electric beer jUld frustrated 
sexual drives, the AS softball 
team edged The Guardian's 
elite -nine 17·9 and 11·6 in a 
dou bleheader here yesterday. 

Former AS Vice·President 
Nancy Laga, with two home 
runs, was the hitting star for 
the "AS Exuals." 

Kathy Huffer, Guardian 
editor. noted afterwards that 
Laga's heavy drug intake 
mad e it difficult fo r 
outfielders to distingu ish 
between her dilated pupils 
and the softball. 

And Laga wasn't alone, she 
said. 

"The game was hardly 
fair," Huffer said. "(AS 
President Bill) Topkis alone 

, took enough speed to gas a 
greyhound." 

Thegames were marked by 
one bench-clearing brawl and 
one vicious, heads· up play at 
the plate in which Guardian 
typesetter David Eckmann, 
completing a home run, 
leveled the nose of an 
unidentified AS official, who 
was left writhing on the 
ground by his callous team-
mates. 

The Guardian has chal· 
lenged the AS to a rematch at 
soccer, Huffer said. The AS , 
at home nursing, has not 
responded yet.

The Revelle College 
Players will present their 
third annual musical 
Godspell, April 30. May 1 and

the door. Godspell has 29 cast 
members and more than 30 
people on the production 
staff, and considerable advice 

has come from the UCSD 
Department of Drama. It 
sounds like it's going to be an 
exceptionally vibrant, fun 
presentation.

The Che Cafe will have a

Thursday, April 30 at 8 pm. 
The Che is located at the 
southeast corner of Revelle

Guardian offices. 

Blues keep getting better 
continued from paJle 13 
Blues," a medium tempo 
shuffle with a walking bass 
line and a sasy horn 
arrangement that was brash 
and jubilant. The surprise 
among the soloists was 
harmonica player Keith Aran 

who, playing a diatonic harp 
rather than the expected 
chromatic, took a solo that 
combined the liquid textures 
of Paul Butterfield and the 
melifuous phrasing of the 
late saxophonist Paul 
Desmond. Other solos, . by 

trumpeter Jim Fowler and a 
tenor saxist whose name I 
was unable to fet, provided 
their share 0 interesting 
moments. Though not of the 
highest caliber just yet, they 
show ability beyond their 
years and much promise.
