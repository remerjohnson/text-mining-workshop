Speakers kick off celebration 
of Black History Month 

By SHANNON ELIOT 
Staff Writer 

StudentS and faculty gathered 
in Price Center Plaza to kick off 
Black History Month on Fe\:'. 3. 
The presentation, sponsored by 
the African American Student 
Union, fearured speeches by black 
educators as well as performances 
to promote awareness of African-
culture. 

As the first gathering in a 
series titled "Reflecting on our 
Past, Challenging the Present, 
and Shaping our Future in Higher 
Education/' the presentation was 
celebratory of past black accom-.. 
plishments while also aiming to 
promote activism in overcoming 
obstacles in the present-day black 
community. 

"This is not the only month 
that we should take an active 
interest in blade: culrure and the 
black community and the black 
struggle," AASU president and 
Thurgood Marshall College 
junior Stephanie Akpa said in her 
opening remarks. "It should hap-
pen on a daily basis."

By MARNmE FEDERIS 
Associate News Editor 

The College Republicans at 
UCSD recently started a petition 
asking the A.S. Council to adhere 
to California's Ralph M . Brown 
Act, which requires legislative 
bodies to set agendas at least 72 
hours before a meeting. The law 
also requires that notices be sent 
to constituents one week prior to 
meetings. 

"What we're doing is not 
malicious," College Republicans 

chair Chris Taylor said. "Every 
student has a right to know where 
their money is going. When the 
A.S. [Council] doesn't have agen-
das written out, it makes it diffi-
cult for students to respond to 
things that are going on." 

However, according to A.S. 
Commissioner of Student 
Advocacy Jeff Boyd, the A.S. 
Council consulted Student 
Policies and Judicial Affairs 
director Nicholas S. Aguilar and 
was advised that the Brown Act

The A.S. Council debated legis-
lation that would amend its consti-
tution to make the Commissioner 
of Athletic Relations an appointed 
position. An open roll caU on Feb. 
4 showed that more councilmem-
bers are in favor of the legislation, 
with a vote of 11-8-4. 

Council members must submit 
their final open roU call votes by 4

A.S. Commissioner of Athletic 
Relations Jordan Cross presented 
the legislation to council. 
According to Cross, candidates for 
the position can be easily swayed by 
slates, while the position itself 
needs to maintain a certain apoliti-
cal nature.

Instan·t run'off 
voting postponed 

A.S. votes to use simple 
runoff in Spring elections 

By NEIL SPEARS 
Senior Staff Writer 

Legislation to enact a single 
runoff voting system for next quar-
ter's A.S. elections was narrowly 
approved by the A.S. Council on 
Feb. 4 with a vote of 9-8 with 6 
abstentions. 

Before the change, election 
bylaws stipulated that elections 
would, for the first time, use instant 
runoff voting this year. But accord-
ing to A.S. Elections Manager Tom 
Chapman, StudentLink will be 
unable to implement instant runoff 
voting this year. 

"[Runoff voting] is the closest 
thing we can do for instant runoff 
voting this year," Chapman said. 

Under the new rules, a general 
election will be held on Monday 
through Wednesday of the second 
week of spring quarter. If no candi-
date receives a majority of the vote, 
then the top two candidates will 
compete in a runoff election on 
Thursday and Friday. 

Debate on the council floor last-
ed over an hour and focused on the 
possibility of decreased voter 
turnout and lack of investigation of 
the single runoff system's effective-
ness by the council. 

"It's not fair and you haven't 
consulted enough," Thurgood 
Marshall College Council Chair 
Travis Silva said. 

Silva, along with Thurgood 
Marshall College Sophomore 
Senator Kate Pillon and other 
cOlIDcilmembers, voiced concerns 
that switching to a single runoff 
system after only a few days of 
research flies in the face of the 
months-long research behind the 
recommendation of the voting sys-
tems research task force to imple-
ment instant runoff voti ng. 

"We decided that instant runoff 
voting was the more fair way. We 
did not decide that runoff was the 
more fair way," Pillon said. "Instant 
runoff voting and runoff voti ng are

Athletics: A.S. Council divided 
contin~d from page I 

out and expanding athletics into all arenas 
of student life," Cross said. "I am concerned 
that if this position becomes one of a popu-
larity contest, students will ultimately lose. I 
think it would be a disgrace to our students, 
athletes and school to tie this position in 
with slate politics." 

However, some councilmembers argued 
that making the position appointed would 
take away from student voice. 

"( think that this dramatically takes away 
from direct student input," A.S. President 
Jeremy Paul Gallagher said. "One of the ben-
efits in having direct srudent input is that you 
can have someone who wants to push for 

UCSD to have Division I sports and some-
one who wants to push for something radi-
cally different - although some may argue 
that those people should not be in this posi-
tion, they should have the opportunity to 
run, and that benefit outweighs any other 
issue." 

Others argue that the position should be 
similar to the position of the Commissioner 
of Student Advocacy, which the A.S. 
Council recently voted to make appointed. 
Some councilm'embers argued that there is 
a danger that someone unqualified be elect-
ed to a commissioner office.

IR/PS: Graduate school celebrates Asian 
cultures with performances, fashion show 

conrinUld {rcmt page I 
participate by feeding lucley red 
envelopes to the lions . 

Mannam, an IRiPS Korean 
srudent oq;anization, invited tae 
Icwan do ninth-degree black belt 
master and international referee 
Nam Kim to perform various 
exercises and board-breaking 
feats. 

First-year IR/PS graduate sru-
dent Han Chen performed com-
petition-style tai chi at the festival . 
With a background in both 'tae 
Icwan do and karate, and having 
srudied tai chi intensively for a 
summer in Beijing, Chen said he 
wanted to share this aspect of 
Chinese culture with others. 

"I really want to bring Asian 
culture to the graduate school set-
ting,"'Chen said. "We're usually 
pretty busy with school, and a lot 
of the aspects of Asian culture that 
we enjoy aren't really brought out 
in our coursework ... We find out 
why we're interested in this region 
and see each region's special 

dances and martial arts." 
The festival featured an inter-

national fashion show, in which 
srudent groups modeled tradition-
al clothing from China, Korea, 
Japan and Thailand. 

Other events at the festival 
included a set of Khmer dance 
performances courtesy of the 
Southeast Asia Link group from 
IRIPS and a lesson in contempo-
rary "ikebana" - Japanese-style 
flower arrangement - from pro-
fessional Two Kikuchi and stu-
dents from the Japanese classes at 
the graduate school. 

"Ikebana is based on the con-
cept of perfect flowers, which 
don't exist in the real world," 
Kikuchi said. 

The festival ended with a per-
formance of a scene from 
"Journey to the West" by srudents 
from Chinese classes. "Journey to 
the West" is a classic Chinese 
story about a monkey with super-
natural powers who must accom-
pany a monk on a quest to obtain 

holy Buddhist scriptures. Chen 
was responsible for writing the 
script of the performance. 

Srudents at the festival felt that 
this year's events were successful. 

"This year I think would be the 
best," said Peng Zeng, a second-
year graduate srudent who co-
hosted the festival. "The perfor-
mances really showed the Chinese 
culture, the Korean culture [and 
the) Japanese culrure, and we got a 
lot of IRIPS srudents involved in 
the whole thing. It's definitely a 

• collective action." 
Although PIASO did the major 

coordinating for the events, IRIPS 
srudent groups also contributed 
their efforts. Participating groups 
included Mannam, South East 
Asia Link, China Focus and 
Asameshikai. 

The Graduate SchOQI ofIRlPS 
has a high percentage of srudents 
from overseas. The school offers 
programs with regional specializa-
tion in Japan, China, Korea, 
Southeast Asia and Latin America.

"Wh~t's important about 

[these commissioner) positions is 
that they are very specific jobs that 
require knowing very specific 
details that are not gained 
through electi ons, but gained 
through experience in that office," 
A.S. Commissioner of 
Programming Alex Kushner said. 

Some who opposed the legisla • . 
tion presented responses from their 
constituencies on the issue. Earl 
Warren College Senior Senator 
Jennifer Klage and other Warren 

College senators sent out e-mails 
telling their constiruents about the 
legislation. 

According to K1age, 45 out of 
57 srudents replied in support of 
having the offi.ce for the commis-
sioner of athletic relations remain 
an elected' position. 

"As the Warren senior repre-
sentative, I cannot vote for this 
legislation," K1age said. "This is 
what they want - to go against 
that; I can't do that. " 

Others cited a referendum on 
spring 2003's general elections 

bea 

ballot on which students voted to 
keep all commissioner positions 
elected. 

According to Cross, many 
qualified srudents are deterred by 
the election process. 

"The most qualified people for 
this position may not be the most 
recognizable," Cross said. "Many 
athletes who would do an amazing 
job in this position have expressed 
their lack of interest in participat-
ing in a school-wide election."

Voting: Some on council 
fear decreased voting 

concinUld from page I 
two different things." 

A.S. Vice President Finance 
Eric Webster said that shortening 
the voting time frame and requir-
ing students to vote in two elec-
tions will decrease voter turnout. 

However, Student Council of 
Eleanor Roosevelt College Chair 
David Goodwin denied the claim 
that voter rurnout will be lower 
than usual. 

"Voter rurnout will be terrible 
anyways," Goodwin said. "With 
that in mind, if voter turnout is 
going to be terrible, 1 don't see why 
we don't go with the system that 
seems the fairest." 

When problems with the timely 
implementation of instant runoff 
voting on StudentLink appeared 
two weeks ago, a straw poll of 
council members revealed strong 
support for the use of instant 
runoff voting, even if it were to 
require paper ballots. 

According to Chapman, paper 
balloting would cost about 
$20,000. With a budget of only 
$7,000 for the election, Chapman 
said that instant runoff voting sim-
ply is not feasible this year. 

"I could do [paper balloting) on 
$7,000 with one polling location on 
Library Walk, but that would not 
allow for sufficient access for peo-
ple who want to vote to be able to 
vote," Chapman said. 

Some council members, like 
A.S. Commissioner of Enterprise 
Operations Jeremy Cogan, sup-
ported the implementation of 
runoff voting for other reasons. 

"I saw an election last year 
where two candidates ran with the 
same last names, one of those can-
didates doing so in order to confuse 
voters on a massive scale," Cogan 
said. "I find that to be very unfair. 1 

find runoff voting, whether it's 
instant, whether it's rapid, to be a 
solution to that problem." 

Halfway through the debate, 
Pill on introduced an amendment 
that would have effectively revert-
ed the election system to a simple 
plurality. 

"We had plurality before and it 
worked ... well," Revelle College 
Senior Senator Stefani Martinez 
said. "It wasn't that plurality didn't 
work, we just wanted to find a bet-
ter system. We should go back to 
plurality for this one year and then 
make IRV work without a problem 
next year." 

The amendment failed 7-9 with 
7 abstentions, leaving the legisla-
tion to implement runoff voting 
intact. 

The col\flcil also approved 
changes to the elections bylaws 
which add a 4O-character "expres-
sion statement" under each candi-
date's name, require candidates to 
remove campaign materials prior 
to the announcement of election 
results, and prohibit candidates to 
intentionall y mislead voters. 

Additionally, a bylaw prohibit-
ing campaigning in classrooms was 
clarified to only prohibit active 
campaigning. 

Those changes, which were 
debated separately from the voting 
method, were passed by consensus. 

Unlike constitutional amend-
ments, changes to ~e A.S. Elections 
Bylaws only require a majority of 
the senators' approval to pass. 

Chapman hopes that instant 
runoff voting will be ready on 
SrudentLink by Spring 2005. 

"The dialogue we're having 
now with SrudentLink is the dia-
logue we wanted to have five 
months ago," Chapman said. "But 
at least it's happening now."

Textbooks shouldn't be 
'a chance to swindle 

C alifornia Srudent Public Interest Resea rch Group 
re leased a report on Jan . 29 
examining the detrimental 
cost college srudents incur 
when buying course text-
books. On average, srudents 
pay nearly $900 per year on 
books, CalPIRG said. 

"Rip-off 101 : How the 
C urrent Practices of the 
Textbook Industry Drive Up 
th e Cost of College 
Textbooks" provides insight 
to the struggle to maintain 
affordability aside from ris-
ing fees while acknowledg-
ing support from the sru-
dent, facul ty and administra-
tion communities. The 
report found that instructors 
wt're often unaware of the 
in fl ated costs of assigned 
ma terials, that supplemental 
items in textbook bundles 
such a CD-ROMs ' and 
workbooks go largely 
unused, and that adclitional 
pertinent content was often 
lacking from "updated" edi-
tions. 

Furthermore, U.S. cus-
tomers pay significantly 

more than they would for 
the same book abroad. 
American srudents are get-
ting a raw deal from the 
booksellers. 

CaIPIRG's students 
should be applauded for tak-
ing the initiative to educate 
their peers and professors 
about the necessity for real 
reform. Also, the efforts put 
forth to innovate the market 
with online sites such as 
http://www.compusbookswap.cum 
are a progressive step to 
encourage students to work 
within their own communi-
ties to save money on books. 

However, professors are 
also encouraged to con-
tribute. By informing stu-
dents whether or not a 
book's new edition is neces-
sary, shopping printers to 
find the company with most 
affordable readers and 
weighing in to their depan-
ments and the Academic 
Senate about the need to 
keep book prices level, facul-
ty members can help keep 
college affordable for stu-
dents who are already facing 
soaring srudent fees. 

Education a casualty in 
Bush's 2005 budget 

F irst Lady Laura Bush has stated more . than 
once that her hus-

band 's ties to the education 
community are represented 
by his tie to her, a school 
teacher. One can't help but 
wonder if Laura Bush 
would actually consider 
teaching in the kind of 
school that the Bush 
administration seems to 
generate. 

In his 2005 budget pro-
posal, President Bush 
freezes spending on educa-
tion incentives, programs 
such as Head Start and 
after-school programs like 
the 21st Century 
Community Learning 
Centers and Even Start. 
Literacy programs, drop-
out prevention and bilin-
gual programs either have 
funding frozen or eliminat-
ed entirely. 

This comes on the two-
year anl1lversary of 

Congress' education 
reform legislation, the No 
Child Left Behind Act. At 
the time, Bush promised to 
fulfill the program's focus 
to improve quality and 
accountability In exchange 
for results. But after dimin-
ished funding and weak 
implementation, the pro-
gram is disappearing. 

Education is a basic need 
and it should be a focus for 
even the most reduced of 
domestic policies. Instead 
of lowering taxes or 
increasing funding to 
NASA, perhaps funding 
should be focused on those 
in the most need of it, those 
the closest to home. Before 
handing out irresponsible 
tax cut packages or funding 
programs that will build 
space stations on the moon, 
perhaps a promise should 
be fulfilled to those who 
have the greatest claim on 
responsibility - children.

~ I LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Ethnic affiliation 
source of pride 

Editor: 
The opinion piece from the 

Feb. 2 issue of the GUIlrdian titled 
"'Diversity' has an unusual con-
notation in college" seemed to be 
an attack on students participat-
ing in cultural clubs and ethnic 
minority organizations. The arti-
cle said such students "stay with 
their ethnic group, show a lot of 
pride, and refuse to interact with 
other ethnic groups." 

This statement is a sweeping 
generalization that is by no means 
a retlection of all student cultural 
organizations on campus, in fact 
probably none at all. First of all, 
most students in cultural clubs do 
have friends outside of their ethnic 
group with whom they interact. 

To say they only converse with 
people inside the.ir group is igno-
rant and presumptuous. Some 
students may prefer to spend a 
greater amount of their time with 
friends involved in the same orga-
nization, just like athletes on a 
sports team find themselves hang-
ing out with their sports friends. 

I think the writer should rec-
ognize that some people enjoy 
their ethnic club affiliation 
because it provides a safe outlet 
for them to interact with others 
who speak the same language, or 
eat the same food back at home, 
or just identify with a common 
cultural background. 

The writer himself expresses 
bitterness thilt there is no "white" 
club on campus. If he so wishes 

" It seems that 'diversity' 
in the context of a college 

campus should imply 
exposure to and 

acceptance of all different 
kinds of people. " 

-Arldl ~ Eleanor 
Roosevelt CoIIeP freshman 

there was a group that he could 
identify with, isn't it contradictory 
to assail people who do have that 
certain group? 

It seems that "diversity" in the 
context of a college campus should 
imply exposure to and acceptance 
of all different kinds of people. It 
also implies respect. And if UCSD 
wants to work toward' an environ-
ment that facilitates respect, it 
needs to start with each individual 
respecting other peoples' needs to 
perhaps spend some time with 
those they identify with, and even-
tually become more comfortable 
with themselves to open up to new 
people around them. '

Principles of

the UCSD Principles of

College drinking carries few 
repercussions from peers 

Social lives of university students 
should go beyond alcoholic beverages 

Aftertaste 
Evelyn Hsieh 

I t can be said \vith little hesita-tion that the favorite pa time of college students is drinking 
alcohol. Drinking is so synony-
mous with collegiate amusement 
that it has acquired an almost 
esteemed and obligatory sta tus 
thaJ begs the conditional : If you 
are a college student, then YOll 
must drink. 

Of course, this is not the case, 
bu t the preval ence of alcohol on 
coll ege campuses is undeniable. 
Acco rding to a comprehensive 
200 I study 1.Jy the Core Institute, 
85 percent of college students 
consumed alcohol at least once 
during the year. 

T ltis incredibl e prevalence not 
on ly exists in dorms and at parties, 
but al 0 (perhaps more so) in the 
mindsets, gene ral conversa tion 
and perceived norms of college 
students everywhere. It is com-
monplace to overhear students 
talk about drunken revelry and 
parties on Fridays and hangovers 
011 Monday. 

Even at UCSD, a so-called 
"dry" call1 ~ US , the presence of 
alcohol is clearly seen and heard . 
Alcohol is such a rooted aspect of 
college that it begs a never-asked 

question : Why does college 
social Ii fe revolve around alco-
hol? Namely, what is it about 
alcohol that makes it overwhelm-
ingly the measurement, embodi -
ment and essence of fun at a uni-
versity? 

At a second glance, these pon-
derings may seem somewhat 
unusual, if not nonsensical. In col -
lege, no one really questions the 

" Collegiate drinking has little if no stigma, as far 
as 1 can see. Start with 
one large crowd, add a 

generous helping of 
alcohol, mix weU and 
voila! College fun ." 

. reasons fo r excessive drinking, 
much less casual consumption. It's 
just something you do, or at least 
hear about. 

Not to say that there aren't 
students o ut there who abstain 
from drinlcing (myself being one 
of them), but the acceptance of 
drinlcing as a social activity is so 
far embedded in our conscious-
ness that even nondrinkers treat 
the issue with relative noncha -
lance. 

Collegiate drinking has little if 
no stigma, as far as I can see. Start 
with one large crowd, add a gen-
erous helping of alcohol, mix well , 
and voila! College fun. It makes 
perfect sense. Well , that is until 
you look at the logic of it all. 
Basically, consuming alcohol in 
excessive amounts blurs and dulls 
the senses, causes people to do 
extre mely idioti c albeit funny 
things, frequently vomit, have 
hangovers, feci like crap, injure 
themselves and others, drive dan-
gerously, do things they regret, 
and generally surrender any rem-
nants of intelligence or discretion. 
While drinki ng does not always 
equate with drunkenn ess, it is a 
precondition. 

I'm not tryi ng to offend the 
vas t proportion of students here 
on campus, bu t really, isn 't the 
above li st of alco hol- ind uced 
activities accurate' Bright and 
hard-wo rking s tudents chug 
down beer after bee r and do it all 
over aga in next Friday despite 
(or because of?) the after-effec ts. 
J t certainly ca n 't be the t as te 
alone; very fe w wo uld probably 
prefer the taste of liquor over 
soda unless it is mixed in . It 
doesn 't make so much sense, now 
does it? 

It ' d be unfair here to merely 
point a condemning finger at the 
preferred social activity of col -
lege students. And I must di s-

OPINION 5 

In light of Iraq's facts, 
reflection warranted 
By JESSICA LlNGEL 

Opinion Editor 

In light o f all those politicians 
and administrators shaking their 
heads in disbelief and resignation 
at the lack of information - or 
the accessibility of wrong infor-
mation - regarding weapons of 
m ass destruction in Iraq, there is 
at least one party who can cla im 
that it had every reason to believe 
that there were no nuclear materi -
a ls to be fo und. Mohamed EI 
Baradei, head of 
the Uni ted 
Na tions nuclea r 

" 

nity and P rime M ini ster Tony 
Bl air implements a similar pro -
gram on his side of the Atla nti c, 
confessions of inaccuracy abound 
throughout the Capi tal. Secretary 
of State C olin Powell has publicly 
stated in the New York Timfs that 
had he known about the lack of 
weapons of mass destruction, he 
woul dn't have supported the war. 

Accordi ng to an 'o nl ine Web 
poll conducted by lewsweek, 7" 
percent of those po lled believe that 
Bush and Vice President Dick 

agenc~ issued a 
statement remark-
ably close to the 
situation kn own to 
be true today : 
there was " no evi-
d ence of resumed 
nuclear activities ... 
n or any indicati on 
of nuclear- related 
prohibited actiVI-
ti es at any related 
site." 

In addition to the 
loss of life and 

prOperty, there is a 
noted loss in respect 
for leaders , a loss 

that wiU prove 
difficult to replace. II 

Cheney knowingly 
mi s repr ese nt e d 
intellige nce on 
Iraq. J n addi tion LO 
the los o f li fe .lI1d 
property, there is a 

'noted loss in 
respect for leade r , 
a loss that will 
prove diffi cult to 
repl ace. 

O f course, 
none of thi s is to 
say that the inva-
sion of Iraq didn 't 
have benefits. 

T hat sta tement 
was issued after EI 
Baradei's team had performed 247 
inspections at 147 sites. T he same 
goes for bio logical warfa re technol-
ogy: Hans Blix headed 73 1 inspec-
tions between November 2002 and 
March 2003, searching for evi-
dence of biological weapons. H is 
team found nothing. Confi rmation 
of these results took hundreds of 
Iraqi and dozens of Allied lives. 
Perhaps we should have gone with 
what the United ations tOld us to 
be tme. 

As President George W. Bush 
agrees to an investigative commit-
tee into the intelligence commu-

Idea li sts might 
point to the cap-

ture and removal of a terrible bru-
tal dictator who had long abused 
hi s people and terro ri zed nea rby 
nations. Cynic will say that the 
U ni ted States now has access to oil 
fie lds galore, that .the war was one 
of fi nancial motivations - an 
argument that is perhaps weak in 
light of how much money was 
spent in military force and recon-
structi on. But neithe r reason 
resolves a key pretense of this war 
with which everyone was supposed 
to agree .

THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY. FEBRUARY 5. 2004 

Drinking: Social norms not always acceptable 
continued from page 5 

claim that I am not aU familiar 
with the party scene so many of 
my observations may be flawed. J 
admit that the extent of my expe-
rience is mostly encompassed by 
conversations I overhear on the 
shuttle, characterized by, "I was 
soooo hung over." 

I've heard that drinking 
loosens up the atmosphere and 
the very quality of being inebriat-
ed beyond comprehension lets 
individuals party down, carefree 
of reality'S responsibilities. Take a 
beer bong or a funnel and drown 
your worries awaYi or watch 
someone else do it and laugh your 
cares away. There must be some 
appeal if millions of students 
enjoy it so much. What is puz-
zling to me is that it seems that 
the presence of alcohol is integral 
to having fun . Additionally, the 
frequently mentioned, alleged 
dearth of school spirit and social 
life at UCSD is sometimes attrib-
uted to the aforementioned "dry-
ness" of our campus. 

If alcohol is the £t'el for fun, 
then p rhaps the lack of a fraterni-
ty row at UCSD is the reason for 
the deadness of we,!kend life. 

There are parties and clubs galore 
to indulge in, however, and some 
students have found it a mostly suf-
ficient substitute. Here, students 
frolic in alcohol-soaked indulgence 
and enjoy the craziness and, less so, 
the stupor that follows. 

One can't really expect these 
same students to enjoy a round of 
Taboo or Twister. There are plen-
ty of ways to have fun without 
drinking - movies, conversa-
tions, shopping, outings, and yes, 
board games. They could do all 
these things without worrying 
about cops or throwing up yester-
day's brea kfast. Students know 
this, but it's not the same. Mter 
all, drinking is a grown-up privi-
lege that must be employed as 
soon as parents are out of the pic-
ture. And as college is the time to 
stretch out those wings and fly to 
freedom, alcohol is a required 
accompaniment for the ride. If 
this is true, then the propensity to 
drink is rooted beyond a mere 
desire for mindless pleasure. 

Students revel in doing what 
they are told not to do. Is it inaccu-
rate to say that drinking isn't as 
exciting when one turns 21? I don't 
know. 

But there must be some allure to 
fuse the notion of social enjoyment 
to the consumption of a drink. 
Students get into other self-
destructive patterns with full 
knowledge of the outcome. 
Students probably cease the endless 
parties once they're out in the "real 
world." 

The reason for college drinking 
may be the overwhelming need to 
be like their friends (even though 
"peer pressure" is a term relegated 
to high school drug-preven tion 
seminars). Maybe it is just more fun 
when alcohol is served. And, yeah. 
maybe it is that margaritas and Jell-
o shots just taste better than the 
virgin kinds. Or maybe drinking 
fulfills a need for pleasure or mean-
ing that is, in fact, insatiable. 

In the end, I can find no com-
plete explanation for the strong 
pull of the beer can. I do. however, 
suspect that the answer lies beyond 
the social circles and deeper into 
individuals themselves. They must 
know that something lies beyond 
the bottle.

Iraq: No weapons found, time to learn 
continued from page 5 

Whether or not oil was a moti-
vating factor and whether or not an 
individual sovereign nation should 
take it upon i tsel f to punish the 
leader of a foreign country, ridding 
the world of a dangerous threat, is 
defensi ble. 

The removal of biological and 
nuclear weapons was the key pre-
cept of Operation Iraqi Freedom. 
And now it rurns out that that pre-
cept was false . . 

Hindsight is 20120 and it's easy 
to say that there's no way we could 
have known that weapons weren't 
there. It's easy to say that we should 
have trusted the UN weapons 
inspectors, we should have waited 
for international approval, we 
should have made more of an effort 
to gather information before press-
ing ahead with an invasion that 
would cause devastating losses in 
both property and life. 

Actions are only as good as 
their motivations and effects. It 
rurns out that the motivations 
behind this action were not well-
founded , at least as far as weapons 
of mass destruction go. The 
important thing now is to view 
this as an example of poor fore-
sight, of not gathering enough 
information and of not relying on 
reliable sources. 

The United Nations was creat-
ed as a supra-national organization 
capable of monitoring and punish-
ing another nation's activity. The 
biggest mistake made in the war 
with Iraq, the one that will have the 
longest effects, is the lack of inter-
national involvement. Blame for 

this should neither fall on the 
United Nations nor countries 
we've come to antagonize for their 
decision not to join the campgain. 

Rather, the blame should be 
placed on the United States for 
ignoring the UN inspectors, for 
not stressing international cooper-
ation. 

There is a distinction between 
anguish over what has happened 
and acceptance of what can be 
done in the future . A distinction 

" Actions are only as 
good as their 

motivations and effects. It 
turns out that the 

motivations behind 
[invading Iraq] were not 

weU~founded, at least as 
far as weapons of mass 

destruction go. " 
between wanting an investigation 
in order to further a sense of self-
righteousness and wanting an 
investigation to prevent future 
misinformation. 

For the moment, it's imporrant 
for both hawks and doves to regu-
late their reactions. To those who 
never supported the war in Iraq, it 
might be easy to become further 

embittered, to consider themselves 
with the inalienable right to cry, 
"Told you so!" But that's not an 
effective way of dealing with the 
situation at hand. And neither 
should the pro-war camp waste 
time blundering through excuses 
for why the misconceptions were so 
attractive, why the war 'was still 
necessary. 

Protesters should be valiuated 
and the pro-war crowd should be 
reconciliatory. Certainly, an inves-
tigation should be launched as to 
how such a grave untruth came to 
dotninate the military agenda. But 
more than aU of this, it should be 
noted that this cavalier action with 
meditation on the facts only after 
action has been taken has set a dan-
gerous precedent. 

As for the investigation lhat 
Bush has sanctioned and many 
Democrats have long called for, it 
seems that regardless of where the 
information went wrong, perhaps 
the most noteworthy aspect is the 
admission that something went 
wrong. A huge impetus to the frus-
tration regarding the investigation 
heretofore was the frightening 
implication of infallibility. Such an 
attitude can only lead to further 
invasion with the wrong motiva-
tion. 

History repeats itself, or so the 
saying goes. This is one instance 
that demonstrates quite clearly why 
it's important to understand what is 
happening in the policies and 
actions of the world in order to 
prevent them from reoccuring. 
This is one instance when history 
cannot be allowed to repeat itself.

expression at UCSD .. . within the 

. bounds of courtesy, sensitivity, con-
fidentiality and respect ... " 

I can 't seem to find where the 
Koala fits in there, anywhere. As for 
the shredders, one could argue that 
encouraging the destruction of the 
Koala is not "appropriately 

respond(i ng) to such acts," but one 
must also ask, "What kind of uni-
versity do we attend where not only 
do our student fees fund the KOIIIa 
but we also condemn those who 
actively seek to change the status 
quo by destroying it?" The shred-
ders are not the enemy on this cam-
pus - hate and discrimination are 
not the result of those Thurgood 
Marshall students. 

Furthermore, Guardian writer 
Ed Wu in "Koala critics cross with 
shredding antics on Library Walk" 
Gan. 29, 2004) proclaims that "If 

something does offend our sensibil-
ities enough, we should write and 
speak out in protest, not destroy 
the publication in question." 
Students have written and spoken 
out against the Koala in the past and 
nothing has changed. American cit-
izens actively destroy their own flag 
in protest when they disagree with 
its policies - why should a crum-
myoid hate-filled newspaper be 
any different?

Brown: Council asked to 
post agenda 72 hours earlier

does not apply to ASUCSD. 
"The A.S. (Council] is not 

responsible for adhering to the 
Brown Act," Boyd said. "We as a 
student government are not nec-
essarily subject to the Brown Act 
because our authority comes from 
the chancellor. We are an adviso-
ry body and the chancellor can 
dissolve us at any time." 

According to Aguilar, meetings 
of the A.S. (Council) do not have to 
adhere to the Brown Act. 

"In my opinion, the Brown Act 
does not apply to student govern-
ments," Aguilar said. "What stu-
dent governments are bound to are 
constirutional articles and bylaws 
which sets how meetings should be 
conducted and whether they 
should be public or not." 

Boyd said agendas for A.S. 
[Council) meetings are posted on 
their Web site and are available to 
everyone by Tuesday afternoons, 
approximately 24 hours before the 
council's Wednesday meetings. 

"We try to have agendas up on 
the Web sin.: so that if people have 
an issue, they can come in and feel 
free to speak on that," Boyd said. 

According to teX! of the act, 
which was fi:st enacted in 1988, the 
Brown Act was established with the 
philosophy that "public agencies 
exist for the purpose of conducting 
public business, and the public has 
the right to know how its collabo-
rative decisions are being made." 

According to an opinion from 
the California Attorney General's 
office in 1992, community college 
student governments must adhere 
to the Drown Act. The opinion, 
however, does not mention UC 
student governments. 

According to Jeff Boyd, the UC 
~tem differs from community col-
leges because it is governed by the 
UC Board of Regents, who desig-
nate a chancellor for each campus 
who has the ultimate authority when 
it comes to student governments. 

"Community colleges and state 
schools are generally designed for 
all applicants from all residents, 
and so community college (student 
governments) would probably have 
to fall unuer the authority of the 
Brown Act," Boyd said. "However, 
the UC schools are selective, and 
authority is given to the Regents 
who pass down the authority to 
[the A.S. Council) ." 

Ann Parode ' from Campus 
Counsel, which deals with legal 
issues for the university and reports 
to the Office of the Chancellor, 
also said that there are differences 

be~een community college and 
UC student governments. 

"A community college is a 'local 
district,' for purposes of the Brown 
Act, whereas the Regents of the 
University of California is a 'public 
trust' created under the California 
constitution," Parode said. "It is a 
statewide administrative agency, 
not a local agency." 

Taylor said thllt while there are 
questions of whether the Brown 
Act applies to UC student govern-
ments, the AS. Council should still 
consider following the act. 

"[The) AS. [Council) is contest-
ing that they don't fall under this, 
and if that's true, it's not a lot to ask 
to support something like this," 
Taylor said. "I'd be really surprised 
if they don't want to do this because 
it's basically saying they don't want 
any accountability, and they don't 
want students to come when they're 
giving out their money." 

According to Boyd, meeting the 
requirements of the Brown Act 
would mean a few changes to the 
way the AS. Council sets its agen-
da. 

"If we did have to be in compli-
ance with the Brown Act, we would 
have to then make our agendas by 
Friday, which would change all of 
our deadli.II:$ and would make it 
difficult lor us to get all of our stuff 

done," Boyd said. "Being a lot 
more lax in our agenda allows us to 
deal with new problems that come 
up during the weekelld." 

The College Republicans' peti-
tion also cited the California 
Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act, 
which requires state boards and 
any advisory board or conunittee 
to conduct open meetings. 

However, Parode also cites an 
oplDJOn from the Attorney 
General's office in 1983 which 
states that the open meeting law is 
inapplicable to "bodies that advise 
the Regents of the University of 
California or that exerc.ise authority 
delegated to them by the Regents." 

For some, the issue is that stu-
dents should be aware of how the 
A.S. Council appropriates funds. 

"By having them provide a 
schedule and agenda ahead of time, 
it prevents [the) AS. (Council) from 
sloppy appropriation of our 
money," CoUege Republicans vice 
chair internal ' Adam Richardson 
said. "They would have to stick with 
a certain agenda, and we would 
know where money is going."

lllURSDAY, FEBRUARY 5, 2~ 

. History: 
Academic 

achievement 
examined 

continued from page I 
Unified School District of being 
segregated and providing inferior 
education to minority students. 
The educational facilities in ques-
tion were accused of being separate 
but unequal. Despite the district's 
incorporation of bussing, achieve-
ment statistics of black students 
continued to fall consistently 
below the academic standard. 

"It has been nearly 40 years 
since the Car/in case and the dis-
parity between white students and 
students of color, when it comes 
to academic achievement, contin-
ues to exist," J ones said. 

Jones said that after the dis-
trict's completion of a state-
administered standardized testing 
in 2003, 16.8 percent of African-
American students were deemed 
proficient or advanced in math, 
compared with the Latino, white 
and Asian student populations, 
which scored 18.5 percent, 43 .8 
percent and 60.1 percent profi-
cient, respectively. 

"Is it because students of color 
are incapable of achieving? I am 
here to tell you in a resounding 
voice, 'no,' that is not the reason 
why," Jones said. 

In attempting to remedy the 
problem of underachievement, 
Jones suggested to "raise teacher 
expectations of students of cqlor, 
inform teachers to instruct as if all 
children are college-bound, 
accept no excuses when it comes 
to coursework .. . and recognize 
and believe all kids are capable of 
achieving." 

Preuss School junior Christina 
Griffin added to Jones's senti-
ments on the importance of giving 
driven and disciplined minority 
students an equal opportunity to 
fulfill the educational require-
ments needed to attend college 
and pursue excellence in higher 
education. While Jones' commen-
tary addressed current problems 
and potential solutions, Griffin 
shared her own personal story. 

Griffin praised her involve-
ment with Advancement Via 
Individual Determination, a pro-
gram that helps students reach 
their academic potential, but rec-
ognized that there still existed a 
certain lack of opportunities for 
other students. 

"While the class was made up 
of 12 college-bound seventh-
graders, I knew that we were not 
the only seventh-graders in the 
school who wanted to go to col-
lege," Griffin said. She said she 
did not understand why "the same 
information, same opportunities, 
and same initiatives" were not 
made available to other seventh-
grade students who were not affil-
iated with A.v.LD., but nonethe-
less had dreams of attending col-
lege. 

Now, as an 11th-grader, 
Griffin praises the equal opportu-
nities that she and students of all 
ethnicities who seek to pursue 
higher learning have been given at 
Preuss. 

"I know my classmates, and I 
will not be kept out of the know of 
anything because we are all taking 
advanced placement and honors 
classes," Griffin said. "At my 
school, we are all given a more-
than-equal-opportunity to suc-
ceed, and the responsibility we 
have to take advantage of that 
depends on our individual want to 
do so," Griffin said. 

The program also featured 
dance performances by UCSD's 
hip-hop dance group Erratix and a 
capella vocal music performances 
by gospel duo Two For Him.

THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 5, 2004 

Bright, warm, incandescent light bathes a room filled with chat-tering UCSD students. 
Espresso Roma is an orchestra of 
conversations, blenders, espresso 
machines and ringing registers. A 
man in a brown, orange and white-
striped beanie is sitting on a stool at 
the far end of the coffeehouse. 
Armed with a guitar and quiet 
charm, 24-year-old Jason Yamaoka 
is freshly in to his post as a new solo 
act under his project name J. 
Turtle. He strums an acoustic 
Martin guitar with folk-rock grace 
and scrunches emotions through 
his facial expressions while he 
sings. . 

). Turtle's acoustic folk-rock res-
onates witll the crowd of students 
in Roma; as more students loolr up 
from their dlick textbooks and lis-
ten intently throughout the set. He 
is no stranger to the coffeehouse 
rock scene. Yamaoka is previously 
of Jason and Jane, a San Diego-
based duo Oason attended San 
Diego State University and Jane 
attended UCSD) that gained much 
popularity in the coffeehouse cir-
cuit since their emergence four 
years ago. The duo parted ways in 
February 2003 and Jason has since 
re-emerged with a vision: to be an 
independcl .t musician and produc-
er, with Ani DiFranco-like com-
mand of control over his own busi-
ness and music. He stresses inde-
pendence and is very intent about 
having no limitations with his 
music. "The reason I don't want to 
sign to a label is because I know 
they are going to ask for an image," 
he said. 

The music is a charming reper-
toire of songs about relationships, 
love lost, love gained and sleepless 
nights. J. Turtle's songs are sounds 
that he would describe as raw. He 
draws insl Ji ration from favorite 
bands, ranging from the country-
tinged Toad the Wet Sprocket to 
hip-hop pop Outkast. He speaks 
and grins with a sweet little boy's 
ease, and talks to the audience as if 

each perso'n in it was a good 
friend. As J . Turtle plays, sweetly 
haunting acoustic sounds float 
through the air and grace past the 
faces of weary yet intrigued stu-
dents. The lyrics are honest and 
open, and so is he. At the end of 
his set, the whole coffeehouse 
applauds - a drastic change from 
the first few hapless claps and lis-
teners at the beginning of the 
show. An audience is charmed. 
Many fresh-faced fans are born, 
and he talks to everyone who 
approaches him - and a lot do. 

The staff at Roma say). Turtle 
had one of the best turnouts for 
Roma Nights ever: He has always 
drawn a large crowd, whether with 
Jason and Jane or as J. Turtle.

The Shins: No gimmicks, just great melodies 
New Mexico natives bring indie-pop style and fine-tuned lyrics to San Diego 

CDuItesy 01 Sub Pop 
Don't shun them: Featuring a range rj vocals from lead singer James Mercer, the Shins have hugely impacted the music scene 
with their latest album, Chures Too Narrow. catch the shindig at canes Bar and Grill. 

By CLAYTON WORFOLK 
Senior Staff Writer 

While Andre 3000 shimmied, the Strokes discovered their inner-Cars, and Jack and 
Meg' managed to further muddy 
the details of their relationship, the 
Shins worked this year to once and 
for all dispel the myth tha t all 
things indie are unlistenable . 

To the contrary, the Shins fash-
ioned one of the year's most melod-
ic records with Chutes Too Narrow, a 
virtually uncontested indie-pop 
success that breezed ontO the Top 
10 lists of countless critics and won 
over legions that missed the New 
Mexico quartet's 2001 debut, Ob, 
Inverted World. The Shins will carry 
this hype to their sold-out show at 
Canes Bar and Grill in Mission 
Beach on Feb. 8 . 

The Shins are often, and not 
mistakenly, compared to two great 
pop baUadeers of the 19605, the 
Zombies and the Beach Boys. 
However, what the Shins do on 
Chlltts and, to only a slightly lesser 
degree on Ob, IlIve1ted World, is 

refreshingly unique. Though infec-
tiously catchy, the band's songs are 
neither sugary-sweet nor sonically 
challenging. The Shins instead opt 
to craft left-field pop tunes that 
change direction at just the right 
moment to create the beautiful 
hooks that characterize every song. 
What's more, songwriter/vocal -
ist/guitarist James Mercer 's 
melodies don't rely on intricate 
harmonies or extensive instrumen-
tation, but simply on excell ent 
songwriting.

so it is yet another Friday night and there is nothing to do. Well, get out of that lonely 
room, grab some friends and start

on Feb. 6 at the ERC Green. 

Red Big Fish is arguably the 
most popular headliner any col-
lege concert has procured, making 
thi the most promising college 
concert at UCSD. The quarterly 
$5 ERC activity fee approved last 
year gave the E RC student coun-
cil the funds to snag Reel Big Fish 
for this year's concert, which is a 
reincarnation of the 
ERCapaLUAU. 

Reel Big Fish promises to give 

• 

a grear show. It is one of the third-
wave ska bands that broke out in 
the 1990s with simi lar bands like 

o Doubt who later abandoned 
the ska sound. Reel Big Fish, how-
ever, remained faithful to its style 
and started dabbling in differenr 
projects. They contributed to 
"Baseketball," directed by "South 
Park" creators Matt Stone and 
Trey Parker, and had hit singles 
"Sellout" and "Trendy." Its dis-
tinct sound makes the ban-:l a 
must-see on Friday night.

Ben Affleck's career: Dead at 32 
short kids 
are cool 
David MBuzz" Bynum 

Ben Affleck's career was pro-nounced dcad at 10:45 p.m. last Saturday night in a local 
La Jolla theater after the viewing 
of the trailer for his new film, 
"] ersey Girl." 

I'm not quite sure what hap-
pened to Ben Affleck's career, but 
as a once-huge fan, [ can bonestly 
say I no longer care. It was the 
moment I realized this that I knew 
Ben's career was dead. After burst-
ing onto the scene in 1997 with a 
notable performance in the Kevin 
Smith film, "Chasing Amy," and 
an Academy Award for his collab-
oration with Matt Damon in writ-
ing the screenplay for "Good Will 
Hunting," Affleck has systemati-
cally patented a system for tortur-
ing audiences in and out of the-
aters by combining a string of 
waste-of-time film projects with 
an even larger string of waste-of-

.. 

time personal choices. One can't 
help but wonder if he has been 
calling Britney Spears over the 
past year and asking for career 
advice. 

" This says to me tluu people in HoUywood 
seem to think that 

America cares about 
Ben and Jennifer at least 

five times more than 
America actually does. 

The makers of Bennifer's 
latest collaboration got 
the hint fram (Gigli. '" 
Most film actors have the luxU-

ry of being able to escape the ruin 
of bad projects by staying out of 
the public sphere for a while in 
between Jisasters. Affleck, howev-
er, has been in a total of 19 films 
since the release of "Good WiJl 

Hunting," or about one every 
three months . While early pro-
jects like "Shakespeare in Love" 
seemed to have shown some promise, 
his most recent choices have turned 
into disaster after disaster. 

Most recently, this problem has 
been compounded by the public's 
initial interest, and later disinter-
est, in his off-screen affairs with 
Jennifer Lopez. 

Having followed this agonizing 
affair only very distantly, I can 
only ask myself if these two people 
even \mew each other. On Jan. 13 , 
Ben vowed he would marry 
Jennifer, and 10 days later 
Jennifer's people announced that 

th~ wedding wa officially off. 
Tliis is typical of the type of activ-
ity that surrounded the couple's 
engagement that began capturing 
headlines all the way back in 
October 2002. For 14 months the 
public has been taken back and 
forth on the issue. Maybe it is the 
public's fault for caring, but cer-
tainly some of the blame has to lie 
with, and I am ashamed to use this 
term, Bennifer. 

I guess the fascination with the 
wedding can in some way be 
likened to the media's former fas-
cination with Oprah's weight. 
When she is fat one day and skin-
nya week later, and then fat again, 
I am not sure whether me media 
attention that the issue gets is a 
matter of fascination or confusion. 
I can't blame America for wanting 
to have the facts straight; I can 
only blame Beonifer for changing 
the facts so many ti mes in a 14-
month period. 

I think the proof that America 
wasn't really so fascinated with tlle 
Bennifer machine was that "Gigli" 
gros ed $5.6 million at the box 
office. That is roughly one-6fth of 
what Ben and Jen made combined 
for shooting the film. In compari-
son, another bad Affleck film, 
"Daredevil," pulled in $45 million. 
This says to me that people in 
Hollywood seem to think that 
America cares about Ben and 
Jennifer at least five times more 
than America actually does. The 
makers of Bennifr.r's latest collab-
oration got the hint from "Gigli." 
J-Lo was removed from posters of 
"Jersey Girl" and promoters are 
playing down her 15 -minute role 
in hopes of not repeating a 
"Gigli"-like disaster. 

Sadly, it seems "Jersey Girl" 
was Affleck's attempt to go back to 
the well. Directed by Kevin Smith, 
Affleck knew that he couldn't 
afford to fail in this latest attempt. 
But after seeing the trailer for this 
abomination, I can promise that 
he will. This time, it won't even be 
J-Lo's fault. The simple &ct is that 
AfBeck has become box-office poison. 

Affleck's overnight success 
came by virtue of the fact that he 
displayed a flash of genius in his 
participation in "Good Will 
Hunting." In the, past five years, 
Ben has used that flash of success 
to rake in a fortune by playing a 
long list of roles that could have 
been played by Freddy Prinze, Jr. 
Unfortunately, the residuals of 
the brilliance that was "Good 
Will Hunting" are all but gone 
and no one has seen even a mod-
icum of anything luminous from 
him since then. 

All of the benefit of Ben's early 
success is now overwhelmed by 
doubt of ever seeing any again. 
While America once thought 
Affleck an artist, they now mow 
him to be a playboy and nothing 
more than a pretty face. The prob-
lem with this is that there is always 
a younger one around the comer. 
It won't be long before Affleck will 
be an afterthought to Ashton 
Kutcher. 

Affleck's career is survived by 
his brother Casey Affleck's 
career. The memorial services 
will show in a theater near you 
less and less frequently for the 
n en few years.

'Miracle' not usual Disney fodder 
Film features accurat~ representation of historical event 

By EVAN McLAUGHUN 
Senior Staff Writer 

Do you believe in miracles? For sports fans, a miracle would be if Disney, for once, didn't screw up a 
sports movie with over-the-top cliches and 
irritating attempts at humorous dialogue. 
"Miracle," the story of the gold medal-win-
ning 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team, pro-
vides technically realistic hockey scenes 
and portrays the true passion required for 
probably the greatest sports upset of the 
20th century. 

Kurt Russell ("Tombstone," "Escape 

from New York") gives a stirring perfor-
mance as Herb Brooks, the college hockey 
coach hired to lead Team USA at tlle '80 
Lake Placid games without embarrassing 
the team and nation on the world stage. 
Brooks assembles a unit of ragtag players 
and unrelentingly molds them into a swift-

'Jap~nese Story': Indie laden with brilliant subtleties Shins: Band 
will bring 
innovative 

style to stage 

Superb acting, realistic chemistry and engaging story drive this Australian gem' 
By ANNE CONG-HUYEN 

Hiatus Editor 

Perilous deserts, a sexy geolo-gist, a Japane e businessman 
- these are the basic ingredi-

ents that make up Sue Brook's 
exhilarating drama, "Japanese 
Story." 

Set in the breathtaking 
Australian wilderness, the tale 
begins with an independeQt, 
strong-willed, single, working 
woman, Sandy (played by the love-
Iyand hlonde Toni Collette), who 
unwillingly babysits a foreign 

businessman named Hiromitsu 
(Gotaru Tsunamisha). Hiromitsu 
is intent on seeing the exciting and 
alien sites of a big wild continent. 
But the dislike and misunder-
standings between the two 
strangers slowly give way to a ten-
sion-filled friendship and unlikely 
romance. 

Initially funny and ultimately 
dramatic, "Japanese Story" man-
ages to combine two people from 
distinct cultures and place them 
in a realistic and engaging story 
full of human emotion and 
intriguing enigma. Much like the 

fall indie hit, "Lost in 
Translation," Brook's film is full 
of subtleties - visual, auditory 
and emotional - that secretly 
stay with you long after the film 
has ended. 

Although the film is far from 
perfect, the acting is sensational, 
especially by Collette. No longer 
the weird single mother ("About a 
Boy," "The Sixth Sense"), the 
awkward girl ("Muriel's 
Wedding") or the supporting 
character ("Dinner with Friends," 
"Velvet Goldminc"), Collette is 
now able to take on a character

R'Jnner-up no longer: Toni Collette shifts from her usual supporting roles to shine as the lead in "Japanese Story: a tale of an 
Australian w:lrT1an forced to play tour guide for a demanding visitor and the dynamic relationship that develops. 

Miracle: Filmmakers capture the emotions of 
America in 1980, adding to the films spirit 

c/,ntltued from page I I 
known as "the Miracle on Ice." 

Throughout Brooks' odyssey 
for redemption (as a player he was 
cut from he gold medal-winning 
1960 team just before the Winter 
Games), he remains undaunted in 
his quest - but often at the 
expense of his family and his play-
ers' spirits. "Miracle" is more or 
less a story of Brooks' own drive 
for glory while the rest of the cast 
is portrayed as on-and-off believ-
ers at va rious points in the film. 
One gripe may be that the film is 
too much "The Herb Brooks 

Story" and not enough about the 
roustabouts who actually labored 
for the gold. 

The filmmakers' efforts to 
recreate the ambiance of America's 
deflated morale is first revealed in 
the opening montage with archival 
news footage surrounding the 
weaker moments endured by the 
United States in the mid-to-late 
19705: Watergate, the Iran 
hostage crisis, rising inflation, 
Cold War tensions and a gas 
shortage. To understand the sig-
nificance of the U.S. hockey victo-
ry over the Soviet Union, other

than the obvious point that the 
Americans were brutally over-
matched on the ice, the American 
woes of the time needed to be 
depicted. 

Unlike most Disney sports 
films, the cheesiest thing about 
"Miracle" was Brooks' loud-and7 
proud wardrobe. The story seems 
too good to be true, but the facts 
do check out: The U.S. did score a 
last-minute goal in its opening 
game with Sweden to secure a cru-
cial tie; Team USA:<; MarkJohnson 
did score on a buzzer-beating, 
momenrurn-lifting slap shot in the 
opening period of the Soviet 
Union game; and mainstream 
America did not give a puck about 
hockey before this game, only to 
draw true inspiration from the vic-
tory. The action shots are first-
rate. Credit director Gavin 
O'Connor for hiring hockey play-
ers to fill the film's team and not 
actors and body doubles. Both 
O'Connor and Brooks knew what 
was needed for success; not the 
best men, but the right ones.

REVIEW 

and create a degree of complexity 
and sentiment that is pure bril-
liance. She manages to shine by 
virtue of her own talent rather 
than with unnecessa_ry gimmicks 
or in the shadow of a big-name-
no-talent-star. 

Tsunamisha is uncanny in his 
portrayal of an uptight businC$s-
man . His character evolves from 
cold and snobby to curious and 
personable in a delicate manner 
that is suitable for the film. 

Collette and Tsunamisha have 
an undeniable chemistry that pro-
pels the fi lm. Although awkward at 
points, for the better part of the 
film their relationship maintains a 
very realistic feel, thanks to the 
understated realism of 
Tsunamisha's pushy corporate 

. executive and Collette's feisty 
heroine, 

Subtlety in this film may be 
lost on some. "Story" is slow at 
points and never picks up to the 
speed set by many popular films. 
The editing is a bit choppy: Some 
scenes are too short, while others 
drag on. This ultimately creates a 
slight unevenness in the film that 
detracts from its merits. 

Despite its shortcomings, the 
skillful acting and compelling 
plot hold "J apanese Story" 
together to create a strong, intel-
ligent movie that, sadly, may go 
unappreciated by the majority of 
popular audiences.

Mercer's vocals, which range 

from calm faux-Brit to high-regis-
ter Brian Wilson, are the Shins' 
piere de resist/met, forming verses 
and bridges that are just as memo-
rable as the choruses. "Saint 
Simon," possibly the best song on 
Chutes, takes the listener for a cir-
cular ride that finally breaks into a 
blissful, violin-backed chorus of "la 
la las." Other album highlights 
include the arpeggiated keyboards 
of "Mine's Not a High Horse," the 
four-chord drawl of "Gone for 
Good" and the loud/soft dynamics 
of "So Says 1." 

The Shins' evolution into indie-
pop wunderkinds began in 1997 
when the band formed as a side 
project to the members' main 
endeavor, Flake Music. After 
releasing a couple of lo-fi EPs and 
7"s and touring with the reputable 
Modest Mouse, the band won a 
spot on the national scene with Oh, 
Inverted World. The record intro-
duced Mercer as a pop-sensible, if 
somewhat unconventional, song-
writer with the rough-around-the-
edges but coherent "Girl Inform 
Me," "Know Your Onion!" and 
.. ew Slang." 

Members of the Shins had a 
fe~ run-ins with pop culture in 
2002, as Mercer penned the tune 
for a Gap commercial (remember 
the one with Ashton Kutcher and 
company riding bikes "down on 
khaki treet"?) and Crandalt's girl -
friend Elyse Sewell sported a 
well -tailored Shins top in front of 
Tyra Banks last year on "America's 
Top Mode1." 

Released in late 2003, Chuus is

'Women Who Steal' features 
an exuberant cast of three 

Anything goes in this unusual st~ry 
By JESSICA LONG 
Senior Staff Writer 

The basic question is, "Was it a good production?" For San Diego Repertory Theatre's 
"Women Who Steal," the answer to 
that question comes in the form of a 
line from the play itself: "Yes, but ... " 

Overall, the play is good. One of 
the best things about it is that it is 
very fast-paced. There is never any 
rime to get bored. Not that you 
would, anyway. The story is unpre-
dictable and cettainly doesn't go the 
way one would imagine the after-
math of a dinner between the wife 
and the lover of one man to go. 

Anything and everything can, and 
does, happen in this production. 

The acting is well developed and 
the small cast does a fantastic job of 
bringing the story to life. Linda 
Libby plays Peggy, the 50-year-old 
woman who just discovered that her 
husband cheated on her - on 
Christmas Eve of all days. Libby 
does a good job portraying the inse-
curities that plague Peggy ever since 
marrying up in the world as she tries 
to do her best to be a loving mother 
and a devoted wife. 

Shana Wride plays the talkative, 
over-analytical Karen, the 4O-year-

There's no getting around it: Mates of State are a -husband and wife duo who sing together, very

experimental and melodically

little pop songs. Gardner's keys (usu-

up the space of the songs just enough 
to allow the vocal interplay to take 
center stage. 

Surprisingly, the slower songs 
don't work as well, save for some 
pretty melodies in "Open Book." 
For the most part, the songs are 
more infectious when they stay 
unpredictable, changing up rhythms 
and harmonies, but keeping every-
thing grounded in assured hooks and 
heartfelt delivery. You might think 
it's too cute at times, but you're

of the fact it continues sp firmly in

Rock: Student talent to be 
showcased at the concert 
conlimll!d from page /0 

Rock n' Roosevelt make it an 
event that everyone should attend. 
The nonexistent cost is a great 
perk, too. So what are you waiting 
for? Stop playing that spider soli-
taire, step away from your com-
puter, throw on a jacket and head 
over to the new ERC campus for a 
great show. 

n-tURSDAY, FEBRUARY 2004 

Steal: Set 
throws off 
humorous 

performance 
continued from page J :l 

old who slept with Peggy's husband. 
Funny, loud and over-dramatic, 
Wride make the audience love 
Karen, showing her grow as a person 
even when shoving her current crush 
in the trunk of a car. 

Bernard Baldan has the daunting 
task of playing every man in the pro-
duction. This ranges from the poor, 
confused waiter, to Peggy's husband, 
to everyone else in between. He does 
a fantastic job of making each char-
acter so unique that it is easy to for-
get that he plays all of them. The 
whole cast does a great job of work-
ing with each other [Q create believ-
able, likable characters. 

Then, there's the set. The first 
thing that draws the eye is a huge 
pair of sunglasses hanging over the 
middle of the stage. Throughout the 
play the lenses were filled with pic-
tures of everything from trees to 
broken windows, but at each 
moment the glasses served as more 
of a distraction than a useful tool. 
The rest of the set was bright blue 
and looked like a puddle of mud 
when the stage was lit in red. This 
set was then decorated with silver 
icons and CD; when light reflected 
off of these CDs, the reflections 
made the set even more distracting. 

Some of the subject matte); 
underlying the play may nor be as 
relevant to the lives of students as to 
an older audience. Marriages that 
last over 20 years, menopause and a 
40-year-old "younger woman" may 
seem rather far removcd from the 
daily life of students. However, 
themes of cheating lovers, unrequit-
ed love and revenge are relevant to 
any age. 

Whatever flaws this production 
has, the mere humor makes up for 
it. Even the most serious moments 
are peppered with amusement, 
though it tends to be leaning 
toward the dry side on some occa-
sions and toward the over-the-top 
side on other occasions. 

"Women Who Steal" will be 
playing at Lyceum Theatre in 
Hortoll PI:l:t3 until Feb. 22. For 
more information, call the box office 
at (619) 231-4304.

18 SPORTS THE UCSD GUARDIAN lliURSDAY, FEBRUARY 5, 2004 

Softball: UCSD rallies to come back in first game lljl CLUB SPORTS

scored. 
The Lancers regained the lead 

in the sixth, scoring two runs, but 
UCSD raUied back in the bottom 
half of the sixth by scoring three 
runs, topped off by junior left 
fielder Breanne Copes run-scor-
ing double. 

"We've really been working on 
our hitting, and it showed today," 
head coach Patti Gerckens said. 
"It's fun to watch an offensive 
game when it's going your way; 
even our outs were solid hits." 

Bland pitched a two-run com-
plete game, allowing only four 
hits, giving her her first victory of 
the season. 

"It was exciting to see the girls 
come back from being down in the 
sixth," Gerckens said. 

The Tritons were once again 
forced to come back from behind 
in the second game, when the 
La.ncers roughed up freshman 
statting pitcher Tina Rowe for two 
quick runs in the third inning; but 
their lead wns short-lived. 

The Tritons quickly answered 
with two runs of their own in the 
bottom of the third, which start-
ed with a single by freshman 
Melanie Meurer. Senior third 
baseman Amy Mettee netted a 
walk, and Meurer and Mettee 
performed a double steal, setting 
up Aggabao for a two-RBI dou-
ble. 

The Tritons put two more runs 
on the board when Franciscus 
started the fifrh inning off with a 
single, which was followed by 
Aggabao's li rst career home run, 
making the score 4-2. 

Cal Baptist started a comeback 
in the sixth inning but could only 
score one run, which was negated 
in the bottom of the sixth by 

sophomore rightfielder Niki 
Anderson's own first career home 
run, putting the final score at 5-3. 

Rowe gained a victory in her 
first career appearance, giving up 
three runs and six hits in seven full 
innings. 

"Both Jodie and Tina pitched 
great games. They had great con-
trol, and both showed confidence, 
and really got better as the game 

" Our team has the most 
heart of any team in the 
league, and I think that's 
what gets us our wins. " 
- Tina Rowe, women's softball 

freshman pitdIer 
went on," Gerckens sad. "And 
Jamie [Hurst) called twO wonder-
ful games behind the plate. These 
were two great wins to start off the 
season with." 

The early game on Feb. I was 
one UCSD wishes it could forget, 
falling 11-0 at the hands of USD. 
The Toreros started the assault in 
the first inning, and continued 
into the fifrh, when the game 
ended due to the eight-run rule. 
Bland suffered her first loss of the 
season, bringing her record to 1-1 
on the year. 

"Its not good enough to just 
win one of the games in the series 
anymore," Gerckens said. "We 
mentally broke down in the first 
game, and we can't do well if our 
mental game breaks down, 
because physically we have the 
skills. "

continued from page 20 

"It was nice to see some other 
players get in," Ginn said. "Back-
to-back games every weekend take 
a toll on the body ... it helps to sit a 
little." 

San Francisco State pulled to 
within 10 points, but the game was 
never in danger, as UCSD made 
plen ty of free throws to ensure the 
victory. 

Bolton-Gallagher finished with 
II points and added a game-high 
16 rehounds. Junior forward 
Margaret Johnson continued her 
strong play with 10 points and nine 
rebounds. Ginn and freshman 
guard Leora Juster added 10 and 
t3 points, respectively. For the sec-
ond straight game, 10 of the 
Tritons' dressed players con-
tributed at least one point. 

Center Chrissy Ridenour had 
20 points and 21 rebounds for San 
Francisco State. 

The Tritons will now play all 
the teams in the league again, but 

in reverse order. They will play at 
San Francisco State on Feb. 6, 
whom they last played on Jan. 31, 
then at Sonoma State on Feb. 7, 
whom they last played Jan. 30. 

Ginn is interested to see how 
the teams will have changed. 

"When you play teams the sec-
ond time around, you see a lot of 
changes," she said. "It will be inter-
esting to see what kind of coaching 
changes will be made." 

TIlls will be most true of their 
upcoming game against San 
Francisco State, who they will play 
in two consecutive games. 

"It's hard to play the same team 
twice in a row," Ginn said. "They 
are a very athletic team. But we've 
seen what they have, including the 
press they put on us in the fourth 
quarter. We'll have to come out 
with our '/I( game." 

The Tritons will rerum home on 
Feb. 13 and Feb. 14 to face Cal State 
Bakersfield and Cal State Stanislaus, 
respectively, at RIMAC Arena.

In a complete role reversal, 
UCSD steamrolled over USD in 
the second game by a score of 9-0, 
again ending the game in the fifth 
inning. 

"There is nothing that wasn't 
positive about the second game," 
Gerckens said. "But if you beat a 
team that bad in the second game, 
you know you should have beaten 
them in the first." 

Rowe pitched her second com-
plete game, scored her first career 
shutout, and improved her record 
on the season to 2 -0. 

"Our team has the most hean 
out of any' team in the league, and 
I think that's what gets us our 
wins," Rowe said. 

The offensive sparks kept light-
ing for the Tritons, with nearly 
every starter getting at least one hit 
in the second game against USD. 

"Offense showed up and did 
what it is expected to do," 
Gerckens said. 

Mettee and Aggabao once 
again led in offensive numbers, 
with Mettee going 3-for-3 with 
two runs and two RBIs, and 
Aggabao going I-for-I and adding 
both one run and one RBI. 

"We would've liked to have 
gone 4-0 this weekend, but 3 -1 is a 
great start. The competition will 
only get better, but this was a good 
way for us to learn what we need 
to work on," Gerckens said. 

The Tritons take the field 
once again this weekend, when 
they take on Cal State Bakersfield 
at Triton Softball Stadium for 
two games on Feb. 6, with one at 
I p.m. and another at 3 p.m. 
UCSD will play another double-
header on Feb. 7 at home against 
Cal State Stanislaus, with g~mes 
scheduled to start at noon and 2 
p.m. 

Equestrian 
The UCSD Equestrian Western 

Team is still ranked No. 1 in 
Southern California after hosting a 
Western show on Jan. 24 and Jan. 25 
at Del Mar Horse Parlc. 

Western sophomore captain 
Alicia Cunningham-Bryant set a 
great example for the rest of the 
team by winning all of her classes for 
the weekend. Open rider senior 
Linda Torres also brought the team 
points, as she was awarded Reserve 
Champion both days. Advanced 
rider freshman Lindsay Minor 
placed in the top three in her classes, 
as did novice riders senior Morgan 
Messing and junior Kali Felts. 

Sophomore Charlene Zil and 
sophomore Nicole Reagan also 
placed well in their Intermediate II 
class, riding against some tough 
competition from Cal Poly Pomona 
and Mount San Antonio College. 

The equestrian team will be trav-
eling to Cal Poly Pomona and 
Pepperdine next weekend to com-
pete in a pair of English shows. 

Women's lacrosse 
The UCSDs women's lacrosse 

season opener was Jan. 31 against 
Santa Clara University. 

The Tritons got off to a good 
start in the first half with the first 
goal of the season scored by senior 
Elaine Lui. The Broncos answered 
back with three goals of their own, 
putting the score at 3 -I. The Tritons 
fought back, responding with goals 
from freshman rookies Elisha Agee 
and Katie Frehafer. They ended the 
first half strong, tying the score at 4-
4 with another goal from Lui. 

Coming out with power in the 
second half, the Tritons dominated 
with a good defense, forcing many 
turnovers. Lui continued her ram-
pant scoring with two more in the 

second half, finishing the game with 
four goals. But, despite all their 
efforts, the Tritons came up short by 
a fina1 score of 9-6. 

The Tritons have put the loss 
behind them and look forward to 
their upcoming game against 
Ariwna State University. 

Ice hockey 
Coming off three straight wins 

against UCLA, 1has and Cal State 
Nonhridge, the UCSD ice hockey 
team looked fotward to its weekend 
with No. 1 Ariwna State, playing 
twice in two days. Despite a long 
drive, the Tritons still looked good 
on Jan. 30, only down 2-0 after the 
second period. However, a few bad 
bounces led to a three-goal outburst 
by Arizona State. Though the 
Tritons played an even 55 minutes of 
hockey, five minutes was enough for 
the Sun Devils to put up a win of7-
O. 

Saturday afternoon was a differ-
ent story. Early on, the Tritons 
seemed intimidated by Arizona 
State's aggressiveness and hard 
forechecking. However, the goal-
tending of sophomore Gavin 
Gruber kept the game close and 
gave the Tritons a chance to turn the 
game around. 

The Tritons' turnaround was 
sparked by a late second-period goal 
that closed the gap to 3-1. In the 
third period, UCSD came out Ay-
ing, never letting up on either end of 
the ice. Four unanswered goals, 
including three by freshman Kolin 
Ownian in the third period, sealed 
the game for a 5-3 win. 

The Tritons are anticipating a 
strong season finale with games at 
San Diego State and their final 
home game of the season on Feb. 6 
at UTC Ice Town against Fresno 
State at 10:15 p.m. 

D--i UC Irvine sinks UCSD swimming 
Both Triton men's and women's teams fall to Anteaters 

By EVA HOFFMAN 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD swimming and 
diving team fell to UC Irvine, an 
NCAA Division I team, on Jan. 
31. The men's final score was 120-
180, and the women's 175-125. 

After three weeks without com-
petition, the UCSD men got off to 
a good start by claiming first and 
second place in the 2oo-yard med-
ley relay. The winning team, com-
prised of freshman Mike Lahey, 
junior Brett Going, freshman Matt 
Fontes and junior Mark Tare, fin-
ished in 1:35.53 . Freshman Aram 
Yoo, senior Rob Small, sophomore 
Barnabas Sclafani and sophomore 
Mike Isaacs, who formed the sec-
ond-place team, were only eleven 
hundredths of a second behind. 

UCSD also dominated in the 
backstroke, with first and second 
finishes in both events. Lahey 
earned the only individual event 
wins for UCSD · with times of 
52.03 in the 100-yard backstroke 
and 1:53.90 in the 200-yard back-
stroke. 

Trailing Lahey in the 100-yard 
event was Sclafani, who finished in 
S3.19. In the 200, Yoo placed sec-
ond (1:S7 .69). 

Freshman Paul W!kholm was 
narrowly defeated in the 200-yard 
butterfly. He swam the second-
best time of his life, 1:55.48. 

Tim Fuller, another freshman, 
earned second place in the 200-
yard freestyle with a time of 
1:44.66. 

Alongside the swimmers, 
divers freshman Daniel Grodh 
and sophomore Jason Boehm 
competed for UCSD. Grodh 
placed second on both the one-
meter board and the three-meter 
board. Boehm came in third on 
the three-meter board. 

On the women's side, sopho-
more diver Jennifer Margrave 

claimed second place on both 
boards. 

Although they won only four 
out of 14 events, the women's 
team took first and second place in 
two races. In the 100-yard breast-
stroke, junior Rosanna Delurgio 
swam a winning I :04.34. She was 
followed by senior Denise Bogard 
with a 1 :04.93 . Delurgio, an 
Olympic hopeful, has lost the 100-
yard breaststroke only once in a 
collegiate meet this season. 

Freshman Emily Harlan tri-
umphed in the SO-yard freestyle 
(23 .85). Senior Carolyn Kwok 
came in second (24.30). 

Harlan also placed first in the 
100-yard freestyle (52 :67). 

The women finished their dual 
meet season with a win in the 200-
yard freestyle relay. Freshman 
Laura Johnson, sophomore Sarah 
Grant, freshman Monica Becks and 
junior Katie Miller finished first 
with a time of 1:40.02. UCSD is 
undefeated in the event this season. 

Despite their loss, the teams 
seemed happy about their perfor-
mances. 

"We had amazing swims on 

both the men's and women's 
teams, and successfully shocked 
Irvine, beginning with the first 
medley relay, showing them that 
we were going to be tougher com-
petition than they thought," 
women's co-captain Kwok said. 

The meet against UCI marked 
the end of the dual meet season for 
UCSD. The women's final dual 
meet record is 4-S and the men's 
record is 1-5. 

"We've definitely swum against 
some of the best teams in the 
country, swimming· a primarily 
Division I schedule," UCSD head 
coach Scott McGihon said. "The 
reason be.lUnd that is simple: If we 
want to swim our best at the end 
of the year, we need to swim the 
best during the year. " . 

The teams will next compete at 
the Pacific Collegiate Swim 
Conference Championships Feb. 
II to Feb. 14 in Long Beach, 
Calif. 

When asked what the teams' 
goals for the meet are, McGihon 
said, "To win." He also said, "Along 
the way we'd like to get more peo-
ple qualified for NCAAs."

Baseball: Tritons open season with 3 .. 0 start 
continued from page 20 

Hernandez went 4-for-5 at the 
plate. Riddle, Pinocchio and 
pinch hitter Alex Gascon each 
had a double in the game. UCSD 
scored 16 runs on 17 hits in the 
nightcap. 

In the series closer, the 
Rangers scored three times in the 
top of the third inning to take a 4-
I lead over the Tritons. Regis 
scored again in the top of the 
fourth. Down 5-2, UCSD junior 
second baseman Joel Clark 
smacked a single up the middle to 
plate Langone and junior out-
fielder Craig King. 

The Tritons tied the game at 
five apiece in the fifth inning. In 
the bottom of the eighth, good hit-
ting combined with sound base-
running proved to be the key to 
UCSD's third victory. 

Langone bunted his way on 
with one out, stole second and 
advanced to third on another sin-
gle by Clark. That brought up the 
heart of UCSO's order in 
Hernandez, . Riddle and 
Pinocchio, who had punished the 
Rangers all weekend. Langone 
then got caught on the base path. 
Heads-up base running put Clark 
at second. With two outs, 
Hernandez singled up the middJe. 
Clark scored what proved to be 
the game-winner when the throw 
tQ first got past the Regis first 
baseman. After a wild pitch 
advanced Hernandez. to third, 
Riddle provided an insurance run 
with a single to left. 

The Tritons inched out the 
victory, 7-5. Clark finished 3-for-
4 with three . RBIs. Hernandez 

went 3-for-5 and Riddle went 2-
for-4. 

UCSD starting sophomore 
pitcher Byron Grubman went 
three and one-third innings. Only 
three of the five runs scored 
against him were earned. Junior 
pitcher Logan Boutilier (1-0) 
came in to pitch five and two-
thirds innings of strong relief, 
earning the victory for the 
Tritons. Boutilier's performance, 
striking out four while allowing 
no walks and just three hits, was 
enough to earn him California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
Baseball Pitcher of the Week 
honors. 

For the weekend series, 
Hernandez, Riddle and Pinocchio 
went a combined 23-for-34 (.676) 
with 10 runs scored, eight RBIs 
and six doubles. 

The Tritons face Concordia 
University in Irvine, Calif., on Feb. 
4 in non-conference action. UCSD 
then returns to Triton Baseball 
Field this weekend for a three-

Sacramento State. The teams will 
playa single game on Feb. 6 begin-
ning at 2 p.m., and then will play 
single games on Feb. 7 and Feb. 8

Baseball sweeps non--
conference home . opener 
Tritons beat Rangers and open 

2004 season undefeated 
By COURTNEY FIELD 

Senior Staff Writer 

The UCSD baseball team 
went undefeated during its open-
ing weekend and swept its three-
game eries against non-confer-
ence opponent Regis Univer ity. 
In the dou I Ie header on Jan. 31, 
the Tri tons outscored the 
Rangers, 5-2 and 16-6. In the 
series finale on Feb. I, UCSD 
came from a 4-1 deficit to defeat 
Regis by a final core of7-5. 

In the first game of the 2004 
season, UCSD head coach Dan 
O 'Brien introduced many new 
faces into the Triton starting 
lineup. The mix of returning 
players and new players proved 
to be the key to UCSD's initial 
success. 

"We pride ourselves on being 
f\lndament~lly sound, and I think 
we're off to a good start," O'Brien 
said. "This weekend, we were 
consistent on the mound, at the 
plate , on defense and on the 
bases. We will be a very solid ball 
club if we stay consistent .in tho e 
four areas, and continue to focus 
on the little things that win ball 
games." 

Offensively, UCSD junior 
transfer and starting second 
baseman Ricky Pinocchio went 
3-for-3 in the game with two 
doubles, a stolen base and two 
runs scored . Senior catcher Jeff 
Riddle also went 3-for-3 in the 
game and had two RBIs. Triton 
shortstop and UCSD Athlete of 
the Week Keith Hernandez went 
3-for-3 with two doubles, two 
runs scored, a stolen base and an 
RBI. 

UCSD ace pitcher Raf 
Bergstrom (1-0) started on the 
hill for the Tritons and threw six 

innings of stellar baseball. Regis' 
only offensive activity came from 
the bat of catcher Scott Richards 
in the top of the second inning. 
With a runner on first, Richards 
homered to left field and momen-
tarily put the Rangers one up on 
the Tritons. 

UCSD soon countered with a 
run in the third inning and two 
more in the fifth. Triton transfer 
Ryan Leake pitched three innings 
of relief and earned the first save 
of his UCSD career. 

The Tritons came out strong 
in game two of the doubleheader 
and scored eight runs on six hits 
off of Regis pitcher Clay lichota 
(0-1). 

The Ranger ,seeking revenge, 
countered and scored five runs of 
their own in the top of the second 
inning off of UCSD starting 
sophomore pitcher Jose Navarro. 
Navarro went three and two-
thirds innings while transfer 
SWomo Lipetz (1-0) threw three 
and one-third innings of relief 
and earned the victory. 

UCSD continued its offensive 
attack in the bottom of the fourth 
inning when sophomore leftfield-
er Damian Fante hit a home run 
that drove in three runs. The 
Tritons scored six runs in the 
inning. Fante went 2-for-3 in the 
game with two runs scored and 
five RBIs. 

Pinch hitter/third baseman 
Keith Albrecht secured the 
Triton victory with a two-run 
home run in the bottom of the 
sixth inning. 

In the game, Triton outfielder 
Ryan Langone went 2-for-5 with 
two RBIs and one stolen base. 
Pinocchio went 2-for-4 and

UCSD beats San Francisco State 
Women's basketball cruises, 71-57 

By STEPHEN VONDERACH 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD women's basketball 
team finished the first half of its 
season with a convincing win, fea-
turing both impressive defense and 
offense, over San Francisco State 
on Jan. 31. The 71-57 victory 
moved the team to 10-7 overall 
and 6-6 in the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association . 
San Francisco State dropped to 9-8 
overall and 5 -7 in the CCAA. This 
is a huge improvement over last 
year, when at the halfway mark of 
the season UCSD was 3-10, having 
lost their first seven games. 

UCSD jumped out to a huge 
lead and continued to build it up 
until halftime. Senior guard Ali 
Ginn began the rally, helping 
UCSD leap to a 13-6 lead, and 
junior center Stacy Bolton-
Gallagher finished the half with a 
very strong performance. Both 
players had 10 points at halftime, 
and with lots of contributions from 
the other players, UCSD had a 42-
22 lead. 

Ginn has been impressed with 
Bolton-Gallagher's play in the last 
few games. 

"Stacy's been playing great late-
ly," she said. 

Bolton-Gallagher went 6n to 
record double-digit rebounds for 
her second straight game. 

San Francisco State made a 7-0 
run to start the' second half, but 
UCSD put the game out of reach 
after a timeout with a 14-4 run, 
stretching their lead to 56-33. 
With such a huge lead, the team 
was able to rest some of its starters 
and get some other players more 
playing time, specifically senior 
forward Robyn Phillips, freshman 
center Megan Niedermeyer and 
junior guard Lauren Sargent.

To the hoop: UCSD sophomore guard Matthew Conti drives the lane against the 
Gators in the Tritons 80-70 victory on Jan. 31 at RIMACArena. 

By MAn RYAN 
Senior Staff Writer 

The Tritons concluded their 
six-game losing streak against 
San Francisco State, 80-70, with 
an inspired second half of bas-
ketball at RIMAC Arena onJan. 
31. 

UCSD once again got off to 
a sluggish start in the first half, 
going down by as many as nine 
points . The Tritons were able to 
hang around by going 8- for-9 
from the foul line and hitting 
some three-point baskets, cut-
ting the Gators' lead down to 
32 -3 8 at the half. 

UCSD only shot 30 percent 
from the field in the half to San 
Francisco State's blistering 69.6 
percent. At the half, head coach 
Greg Lanthier did not feel that 
the Gators' hot shooting would 
continue. 

"They were 16-for-23 from 
the floor," Lanthier said. "We 
felt that they would not contin-
ue to shoot like that in the sec-
ond half and that we would 
come back." 

In the seco nd half, the 
Tritons looked like a completely 
different team, outscoring the 
Gators 48-32. Junior forward 
Jesse Boyd came out with three 
quick points, and a three-point-
er by sophomore guard 
Matthew Sweany and a foul shot 

gave the Tritons the lead at 41 -
39. The game remained close at 
56-52 at the II-minute mark, 
but then UCSD made its run. 
Junior guard Brandon Francis 
hit a big three-pointer, and 
Boyd followed with a jumper. 
With 5: lion the clock, a three-
point shot by Sweany virtuaJly 
put the game out of reach for 
San Francisco State at 70-57. 
Late free-throws by Boyd sealed 
the win for the Tritons. 

"Any win is a big win, losing 
streak or not" Lanthier said.
