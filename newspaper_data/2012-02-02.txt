SURF REPORT

Staff Writer

Transportation Services revealed five new, environmentally friendly buses at the beginning of this quarter.
    These buses cost $385,000 each. Vehicle 
reserves and grant funding financed the pur-
chase. Transportation Services received $50,000 
for each bus from a grant awarded for replacing 

diesel-burning buses with buses that use alter-
native fuel.

While the buses do not currently display 
any UCSD insignia, they will soon feature the 
new UCSD logo. “There really haven’t been 
any complaints about the buses because they 
have the same speed, acceleration rate and 
size,” A.S. Representative to the Transportation 
Committee Parminder Sandhu said. “The 
quality of the ride hasn’t changed, but it’s newer 
and cleaner inside.”

Unlike the old buses, which ran on diesel 
fuel, these buses run on compressed natural 
gas. According to Sandhu, the Transportation 
Committee is in favor of the purchase of these 
buses. Since CNG burns cleaner than diesel fuel, 
they are more environmentally friendly than the 
old buses. “The new CNG buses will help the 
campus meet its sustainability goals of reducing 
greenhouse gases and particulate emissions, 
while creating significant savings in fuel costs

In three weeks, students will be able to 
see grading history and other statistics that 
can be used to evaluate classes and professors 
before choosing courses. This is due to a new 
grade distribution tool that will be available 
on the A.S. Council website.

The grade distribution tool, a free service 
provided by A.S. Council, will use data sets 
from all UCSD classes since 2007. Students 
will be able to search by class, department 
or professor. “They [will be able to] see a 
summary of GPA — what the grade point 
average that the professor gives out on 
average, how much students tend to drop the 
class, and things along those lines,” Associate 
Vice President of Academic Affairs Mac 
Zilber said. “They [will] also be able to see… 
which classes at UCSD give out the most As, 
which ones give out the least.”

UCSD’s original grade distribution tool 
was taken down several years ago. The tool 
was not widely known to students and did 
not receive much traffic, Zilber said. The A.S. 
Academic Affairs Office had been working 
on creating a new grade distribution tool for 
about three years. 

“Up until pretty recently, UCSD had a tool 
like this on its website,” Zilber said. “Once 
UCSD took the tool off the website, we felt 
that it would be useful for students to have 
access to this information in a way that was 
provided by a ucsd.edu address, not by some 
private company or something along those 
lines.”

A letter alleging that the athletics department 
is trying to keep the upcoming Division-I vote 
on the “down low” was leaked late Wednesday 
night. The letter, supposedly written by a student 
athlete, alleges collaborative efforts between A.S. 
Council and the athletics department towards 
securing the vote. 

“As a member of the athletic community and a 
leader in trying to get the referendum passed, we 
were trying to keep the vote on the [down low],” 
the letter reads. “This is straight from the athletic 
department, we want people to vote, but we only 
want them to vote yes.”

According to former Sixth College Senator 
John Condello, the letter was released by an 
unnamed vice president to a group against 
the move to Division I. It began circulating on 
Facebook on Wednesday night. 

“The VP who released it was approached by 
Alyssa Wing and was told to keep all of this on 

the down low,” Condello said. “That didn’t really 
happen.”

Wing denied any connection to the note and 
said that A.S. Council has a policy of neutrality. 

“As far as we know, the note that appeared 
on Facebook was entirely unaffiliated with A.S., 
the pro campaign, the athletics department, or 
any other organized group involved with the 
referendum,” Wing said in an email. “Contrary 
to some of the comments made, the Facebook 
message was not an A.S. email that circulated. To 
my knowledge, it was a message that was sent to 
an A.S. councilmember.”

Wing said A.S. Council will partake in 
an “unprecedented neutral voter awareness 
operation” when voting opens during Week 8.  

The referendum, if passed by students in the 
upcoming special election, would add a $165 
fee per student per quarter to fund the move to 
Division I sports. Voting begins Week 8 and will 
continue into Week 9.

UCSD School of Medicine researchers 
studying tobacco addiction found that the 
range of pharmaceutical and anti-smoking 
aids available in the last decade has not in-
creased the number of successful quitters. 
�eir results will be published in the An-
nual Review of Public Health.

�e study, led by professor of family 
and preventive medicine John P. Pierce, 
reviewed studies of tobacco addiction con-
ducted within the last 20 years. 

Researchers analyzed the e�ectiveness 
of pharmaceutical drugs, as well as nico-
tine gum and the patch, but found none of 
these aids have been signi�cantly success-
ful. 

“We looked at smokers that had quit 
before 35, before 50 and before 65,” Pierce 
said. “If you quit before 35, we think you 
can avoid as high as 90 percent of the con-
sequences of smoking. If you quit before 
50, you can avoid at least half of them, and 
if you quit before 65 you can avoid at least 
a quarter.”

According to the paper, increasing 
numbers of smokers successfully quit at 
di�erent ages during the 20-year period 
analyzed. �e number of people who quit 
before 35 was higher every year, but the 
numbers leveled o� in the late 1990s, sug-
gesting the number of successful quitters 
had plateaued.

�e researchers noticed this trend 
within all three age groups, indicating that 
fewer people were successfully quitting. 

“It isn’t that the drugs don’t work,” 
Pierce said. “It’s that people think they 
don’t have to try that hard anymore.”

Pierce said that there is evidence that 

pharmaceutical drugs such as the patch are 
successful in clinical trials, but the results 
are not showing up in the general popula-
tion. He said that the data does not show 
there have been more quitters even though 
researchers are seeing more and more peo-
ple using these products.

“Marketing says put on a patch and 
you’ll quit, but it’s a nicotine addiction — 
you can’t cure a nicotine addiction with 
nicotine,” Pierce said. “What you can do is 
dull the withdrawal symptoms while you 
do something else about it.

Pierce said his research showed that the 
most successful group of quitters are those 
who quit without any assistance. 

“You must incorporate behavior 
change,” Pierce said. “You must build up 
the motivation — this is one of the hardest 
things you will ever do and then really go 
for it. Unless you’re doing that, the nico-
tine patch is probably not going to help

THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 2,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG 3

This week’s public A.S. Council 
meeting featured a high public 
attendance of about 25 students and 
free cheese balls.

Like Fall 
Quarter’s public 
meeting, most of 
the members of the 
public attended 
for an attendance 
c o m p e t i t i o n 
between the 
college councils.

“This is my first time; I’ve never 
been to an A.S. meeting before,” 
Eleanor Roosevelt college junior Julie 
Hoang said. “I’m here to support 
ERC and the ERC senators.”

However, there were a few 
members of the public who were 
not affiliated with college councils. 
Like Fall Quarter’s meeting, these 
members came for one reason: food.

“I was doing homework and some 
guy told me there was food, so that’s 
why I’m here,” Revelle college junior 
James Kuo said.

Associate Vice President of 
Athletic Relations Aurora Lopez is 
psyched about Spirit Night, which is 
happening this Friday. Students who 
attend Spirit Night wearing face paint 
will receive free foam fingers.

According to Associate Vice 
President of Student Services Leigh 
Mason, the condom machines in 
Price Center have been restocked. 
Students can now continue to buy 
and use them as needed.

Vice President of Student Life 
Meredith Madnick awarded Muir 
Senator Leah Wong her belated 
Council Member of the Week sash as 
well as this week’s Council Member 
of the Week Roosevelt Senator 
Baldeep Dhaliwal. Congratulations 
on winning such a prestigious award.

“If you ever want to nominate 

someone for Council Member of the 
Week, let me know,” Madnick urged 
council. “I only get to see so much 
and I want to make sure whoever 

is working 
hard is getting 
recognized.”

V i c e 
President of 
External Affairs 
Samer Naji 
introduced a 
resolution in 

support of the March 1 Day of Action. 
While most of council supported the 
idea, not everyone was supportive of 
the language.

“The March 1 protest is going 
to happen anyway,” Associate Vice 
President of College Affairs Leonard 
Bobbitt said. “Even if A.S. doesn’t 
endorse it, you can still plan the 
event. I think ultimately we will 
endorse it, but [the resolution] needs 
some development.”

Council decided it would be best 
to vote again next week so that the 
language of the resolution would 
have a chance to develop.

“We all talked about Samer’s 
proposal and were critical of it, but 
none of you said that you would 
sit down and hash it out with him,” 
Roosevelt Senator Jackie Clavin said. 
“These are the things we should be 
taking a stance on and we should all 
be willing to help.”

Sixth College Senator Cody 
Marshall discussed his senator 
project, the Division I Speed Dating 
event. During this event, up to 350 
students will be able to sit with A.S. 
Council and discuss the Division 
I referendum over free pizza. 
Hopefully, the attendance for free 
pizza will be even higher than it was 
for Wednesday night’s free cheese 
balls.

Grade Distribution Tool is Hoped to Increase A.S. Publicity
Although similar third-party 

websites that evaluate teachers and 
classes, such as ratemyprofessors.
com already exist, Zilber said that 
the council’s new tool will be less 
subjective. “I think this provides 
them with information that is more 
objective than things like Rate My 

Professors,” Zilber said. “I think that I 
often hear faculty complain that Rate 
My Professors is biased because only 
the students who love the class or the 
students that hate the class will report 
on what’s happening. So I think it’s 
nice to give students access to more 
objective information, and they don’t 
have to rely on a small sample size.” 

Zilber said he hopes that offering 
the grade distribution tool on the 
A.S. Council website will draw more 
traffic to the website and help A.S. 
Council promote a variety of other 
services in the future.

New Buses Will Save UCSD Over $200K Annually 
for the university,” Assistant Vice 
Chancellor of Auxiliary and Plant 
Services Russel Thackson said in an 
email. “Environmental sustainability 
is a part of UC San Diego’s DNA and 
a top priority for Transportation 
Services.”

CNG costs about half of what 
diesel fuel costs. Thackson estimates 
a savings of approximately $30,000 
per bus per year, meaning the 
current fleet of five new buses will 
save Transportation Services about 
$150,000 per year. 

Thackson said this savings will 
ultimately help Transportation 
Services’ current $7 million deficit. 
“The new CNG buses are a smart 
investment both fiscally and 
environmentally,” Thackson said. 
“Not only do they provide significant 
operational costs savings, they 
also lower our overall emissions. 
Purchasing the CNG buses is just 
one element in our ongoing push to 

meet UC San Diego sustainability 
goals.”

While there are currently 
five new buses in the bus fleet, 
Transportation Services is expecting 
two more buses, which will make 
the annual fuel and maintenance 
savings $210,000 annually. The two 
additional buses are expected to 
arrive in late 2012. The blue and 
white shuttles that these buses 
replaced were past their ten-year 
lifespan. According to Thackson, 
their age made them expensive to 
operate and maintain.

“To ensure the [old] vehicles were 
in compliance with the California 
Clean Air Act, each bus would have 
needed to be retrofitted with diesel 
pollution control devices,” Thackson 
said. “The buses were also due for 
further repair of major components 
like engines and transmissions.”

Rather than purchase these parts 
for the old buses, which would 
have cost over 50 percent of the 

initial purchase price for the old 
buses, Transportation Services put 
the money towards the new buses. 
“The cost to replace a bus is pretty 
expensive, but from this point on, 
every bus [Transportation Services 
buys] will be an environmentally 
friendly CNG bus,” Sandhu said. The 
buses currently run on the Regents 
route, as well as on the Arriba and 
Nobel routes. “The routes [that the 
buses are used on] were chosen 
based on passenger usage and bus 
capacity, as well as to maximize use 
of the more cost-effective CNG fuel 
in an effort to be as environmentally 
and economically efficient as 
possible,” Thackson said.

Currently, the Transportation 
Committee is surveying commuter 
students to help determine if shuttle 
routes or MTS services will be cut 
or combined.

Eleanor Roosevelt college junior Julie 
Hoang said. “I’m here to support 
ERC and the ERC senators.”

However, there were a few 
members of the public who were 
not affiliated with college councils. 
Like Fall Quarter’s meeting, these 
members came for one reason: food.

“I was doing homework and some 
guy told me there was food, so that’s 
why I’m here,” Revelle college junior 
James Kuo said.

Associate Vice President of 
Athletic Relations Aurora Lopez is 
psyched about Spirit Night, which is 
happening this Friday. Students who 
attend Spirit Night wearing face paint 
will receive free foam fingers.

According to Associate Vice 
President of Student Services Leigh 
Mason, the condom machines in 
Price Center have been restocked. 
Students can now continue to buy 
and use them as needed.

Vice President of Student Life 
Meredith Madnick awarded Muir 
Senator Leah Wong her belated 
Council Member of the Week sash as 
well as this week’s Council Member 
of the Week Roosevelt Senator 
Baldeep Dhaliwal. Congratulations 
on winning such a prestigious award.

“If you ever want to nominate 

someone for Council Member of the 
Week, let me know,” Madnick urged 
council. “I only get to see so much 
and I want to make sure whoever 

is working 
hard is getting 
recognized.”

V i c e 
President of 
External Affairs 
Samer Naji 
introduced a 
resolution in 

support of the March 1 Day of Action. 
While most of council supported the 
idea, not everyone was supportive of 
the language.

“The March 1 protest is going 
to happen anyway,” Associate Vice 
President of College Affairs Leonard 
Bobbitt said. “Even if A.S. doesn’t 
endorse it, you can still plan the 
event. I think ultimately we will 
endorse it, but [the resolution] needs 
some development.”

Council decided it would be best 
to vote again next week so that the 
language of the resolution would 
have a chance to develop.

“We all talked about Samer’s 
proposal and were critical of it, but 
none of you said that you would 
sit down and hash it out with him,” 
Roosevelt Senator Jackie Clavin said. 
“These are the things we should be 
taking a stance on and we should all 
be willing to help.”

Sixth College Senator Cody 
Marshall discussed his senator 
project, the Division I Speed Dating 
event. During this event, up to 350 
students will be able to sit with A.S. 
Council and discuss the Division 
I referendum over free pizza. 
Hopefully, the attendance for free 
pizza will be even higher than it was 
for Wednesday night’s free cheese 
balls.

Grade Distribution Tool is Hoped to Increase A.S. Publicity
Although similar third-party 

websites that evaluate teachers and 
classes, such as ratemyprofessors.
com already exist, Zilber said that 
the council’s new tool will be less 
subjective. “I think this provides 
them with information that is more 
objective than things like Rate My 

Professors,” Zilber said. “I think that I 
often hear faculty complain that Rate 
My Professors is biased because only 
the students who love the class or the 
students that hate the class will report 
on what’s happening. So I think it’s 
nice to give students access to more 
objective information, and they don’t 
have to rely on a small sample size.” 

Zilber said he hopes that offering 
the grade distribution tool on the 
A.S. Council website will draw more 
traffic to the website and help A.S. 
Council promote a variety of other 
services in the future.

New Buses Will Save UCSD Over $200K Annually 
for the university,” Assistant Vice 
Chancellor of Auxiliary and Plant 
Services Russel Thackson said in an 
email. “Environmental sustainability 
is a part of UC San Diego’s DNA and 
a top priority for Transportation 
Services.”

CNG costs about half of what 
diesel fuel costs. Thackson estimates 
a savings of approximately $30,000 
per bus per year, meaning the 
current fleet of five new buses will 
save Transportation Services about 
$150,000 per year. 

Thackson said this savings will 
ultimately help Transportation 
Services’ current $7 million deficit. 
“The new CNG buses are a smart 
investment both fiscally and 
environmentally,” Thackson said. 
“Not only do they provide significant 
operational costs savings, they 
also lower our overall emissions. 
Purchasing the CNG buses is just 
one element in our ongoing push to 

meet UC San Diego sustainability 
goals.”

While there are currently 
five new buses in the bus fleet, 
Transportation Services is expecting 
two more buses, which will make 
the annual fuel and maintenance 
savings $210,000 annually. The two 
additional buses are expected to 
arrive in late 2012. The blue and 
white shuttles that these buses 
replaced were past their ten-year 
lifespan. According to Thackson, 
their age made them expensive to 
operate and maintain.

“To ensure the [old] vehicles were 
in compliance with the California 
Clean Air Act, each bus would have 
needed to be retrofitted with diesel 
pollution control devices,” Thackson 
said. “The buses were also due for 
further repair of major components 
like engines and transmissions.”

Rather than purchase these parts 
for the old buses, which would 
have cost over 50 percent of the 

initial purchase price for the old 
buses, Transportation Services put 
the money towards the new buses. 
“The cost to replace a bus is pretty 
expensive, but from this point on, 
every bus [Transportation Services 
buys] will be an environmentally 
friendly CNG bus,” Sandhu said. The 
buses currently run on the Regents 
route, as well as on the Arriba and 
Nobel routes. “The routes [that the 
buses are used on] were chosen 
based on passenger usage and bus 
capacity, as well as to maximize use 
of the more cost-effective CNG fuel 
in an effort to be as environmentally 
and economically efficient as 
possible,” Thackson said.

Currently, the Transportation 
Committee is surveying commuter 
students to help determine if shuttle 
routes or MTS services will be cut 
or combined.

4 THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 2,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

Buying textbooks is the bane of every poor college student’s existence. The only thing 
worse than getting back $20 for a $200 
book at the bookstore is being forced 
to buy those god-awful course readers 
that go straight into the recycling bin 
mere seconds after your final. Never 
fear, How-to Guru will teach you 
how to cheat the system and get texts 
cheap, so eating will no longer be an 
occasional luxury.

First things first — your most 
essential resources are your friends 
and social groups. Don’t be afraid to 

turn the ol’ puppy-dog eyes on your 
friends when you ask to mooch their 
old textbooks for a quarter or two. If 
this doesn’t fly, try negotiating for a 
reasonable price by dropping hints at 
how their friendship has changed your 
life all the while. Don’t be afraid to 
brown-nose — you may be pleasantly 
surprised at the results.

If you’re lucky, sometimes you 
can get away with skimping on 
buying texts altogether. Checking 
RateMyProfessors can be a lifesaver 
because sometimes a kind soul will 
announce that that grossly overpriced 
textbook on your list is supplementary 
reading at best. This can save you 
from parading into class with your 
massive textbook in hand, only to bust 
a vein when the professor announces 
the class is based off of lecture 
material. 

For the linguists out there: Don’t 
buy any of the multiple textbooks, 
CDs and DVDs required for 
linguistics courses because you can 
simply use and abuse the language lab 
on the third floor of HSS, where all of 
the materials are available for free. 

If you can’t weasel your way 
out of buying textbooks, look no 
farther than using online resources 
such as Facebook Marketplace, 
PostYourBook, and Uloop. Through 
these sites, students can negotiate 
prices and arrange to meet with each 
other on-campus to make exchanges. 
PostYourBook has been mass-
emailing the entire UCSD campus 
for two consecutive quarters — the 
website boasts good prices that can be 
bartered down with actual students. 

For the starving literature majors 
out there, PDFs of public domain 
books (Shakespeare, Kant, Locke, etc.) 
can be downloaded free from sites like 
Project Gutenberg. You can read these 
on your laptop, or a Kindle if you’re 
feeling fancy.

Start looking for texts as soon as 
you get your required list because 
ordering online can save you a wad. 
Websites such as Amazon, Half and 
AbeBooks can give you a quick fix, 
with books on the market as low as a 
few cents (shipping is a sneaky little 
gremlin, though). What’s more, you 
can sell back your books through 
these same sites, instead of being 
massively gypped by the insulting 
bookstore buyback prices.

Next quarter, do your wallet — 
and your stomach — a favor and 
investigate your options before 
turning to the bookstore as a last 
resort.

Buy Back 
Your Pride 
by Saving on 
Textbooks

It’s been three months since the pepper spray incident seen around the world. Since the now-iconic example of police brutality 
— when Lt. John Pike pepper sprayed a group 
of seated student protesters — UC Davis has 
found itself at the center of worldwide press 
scrutiny. Over 100,000 people have petitioned 
for the resignation of Chancellor Linda Katehi, 
the woman who ordered the police involvement. 
Pike is now instantly recognizable as the dubious 
star of the “pepper-spraying cop” meme. Davis 
itself is a symbol of the worst opposition to 
the Occupy movement. And in dealing with 
this public relations nightmare, the university 
committed another public relations faux pas 
— shelling out $100,000 for a crisis consultant 
to help itself deal with the fallout. Worse, the 
crisis consultant is from a company that had 
ties to the same organization that’s supposed to 
independently investigate the Nov. 18 incident.

A�er the initial knee-jerk reaction 
of annoyance at misplaced funds, it’s 
understandable that the volume of press 

inquiries is more than one department can 
handle. University communications sta� are 
equipped to write press releases promoting 
campus events, not respond to thousands 
of  requests demanding an interview and 
demanding it now. And the money isn’t coming 
from students’ pockets either. UC spokeswoman 
Lynn Tierney has said that the consultant’s 
salary is coming from an emergency reserve 
fund and, as much as we wish that all UC money 
goes toward education, it’s reasonable that each 
campus has a crisis fund unrelated to student 
tuition, and that now would be the time for 
Davis to use it.

But none of this excuses the bigger issue 
that stems from hiring this particular crisis 
consultant. Davis hired the consultant from 
Marsh, a company that was once part of Kroll, 
the business still investigating the pepper spray 
event. �ough the companies split in 2010, 
and both Tierney and UC President Mark G. 
Yudof both see no con�ict of interest arising 
from the former split, the connection still 

raises concerns over integrity on both sides. A 
crisis consultant, responsible for helping UCD 
respond to an un�attering incident and portray 
itself in the best possible light, should not be in 
any way connected to the people conducting the 
investigation itself. 

As UC Santa Cruz professor Robert Meister 
stated, without knowing the extent to which the 
two organizations will work together, there will 
always be the suspicion that the probe’s fact-
�nding is trying to �t into a coordinated script 
to make the school look better. 

Ultimately, Davis’s poor response to a 
reasonable need for crisis help is likely to inspire 
more ire. 

Although prosecutors have announced 
that none of the original demonstrators will 
be charged, and although the police chief who 
directly approved the pepper spraying is still 
on (albeit paid) administrative leave, this new 
move isn’t doing Davis any favors in the eyes 
of the people that should be its most important 
constituents: its students.

Davis Pepper Spray Crisis Consultant Will Only Raise More Outrage 

Last July, our CSU neighbor San Diego State University hired a new president — a feat we’re in the midst of here at 
UCSD ever since Chancellor Marye Anne Fox 
announced that she will end her eight-year 
tenure this June. �e new SDSU president, Eliot 
Hirshman — previously provost and senior 
vice president of the University of Maryland, 
Baltimore County — was o�ered a he�y salary 
of $400,000. �e amount is a $100,000 raise 
from his predecessor’s salary, and has the 
dubious distinction of being the highest salary 
in the CSU system. 

What’s worse, the CSU trustees hired him at 
this 34-percent salary increase on July 12, the 
same day they voted to increase student tuition 
by 12 percent.

As a result, a state senator has introduced 
legislation to limit UC and CSU executives. 
Senate Bill 967, introduced Jan. 13 by Sen. 
Leland Yee (D-San Francisco), would prohibit 
pay raises within two years of state budget cuts 
or when tuition and student fees are increased. 
Additionally, the bill would cap the salaries of 
newly hired administrators to no more than 
5 percent of their predecessor’s pay. If passed, 
the bill would be legally binding for the CSU 
system, but only a recommendation for the 
autonomous UC system.

Yee — who has been a vocal supporter of 
public higher education — introduced a similar 

bill in 2009 that passed in the state legislature 
but was later vetoed by former Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger.

Gov. Jerry Brown, who recently cut 1 billion 
from higher education, probably wouldn’t do 
the same, considering that even he objected to 
Hirshman’s pay package.

But CSU and UC o�cials have defended 
such raises, claiming that they’re necessary for 
recruiting top talent. And while it’s di�cult 
to swallow such overwhelming salaries when 
schools are �ghting to keep libraries open, we 
have to admit that, looking at the compensation 
received by other public university admins 
nationwide, $400,000 doesn’t look so 
unreasonable.

At University of Alabama — a public school 
with a smaller overall budget than SDSU 
(685 million to 776 million, respectively) and 
smaller enrollment (30,500 to 31,700) — the 
president’s salary is $192,161 more than 
Hirshman’s. Across the board, presidents at 
other public universities are making the same, 
if not more, than the newly hired exec at SDSU. 
Regardless, the pay increases send the wrong 
message to students struggling to pay rising 
fees. More importantly, we simply can’t a�ord 
it. 

Such comparisons to other universities 

Stepping Up the 
Competition

The UC system continues to pay administrators below other comparative systems, but 
with the reputation of  the UC campuses, the system will find the talent it deserves.

Slight Salary Cap Raise Will Strike Adequate Balance 

IN OTHER NEWS By Rebekah Hwang LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Dear Editor,
It is with great regret that I 

pen this letter to mark the recent 
passing of the Guardian’s Dignity. 
It was only after a particularly 
arduous and protracted suffering 
that it finally made the dark passage 
from this world to the next, having 
been ill for some time from a 
perilous mixture of media funding 
deficiencies and student apathy.

In the last week of its life, the 
Guardian’s Dignity submitted to 
an experimental treatment that 
included repeated injections of 
glossy advertising in an attempt to 
support its failing financial system.

While this treatment imbued 
the Guardian with the revenue it 
so desperately needed, in the end 
it served as a tragic final blow 
to feeble Dignity. And with that, 
Dignity departed quietly early this 
Thursday morning, as the Guardian 
was being distributed throughout 
campus.

It will be missed (by some). The 
Guardian’s Dignity was preceded 
in death by the usefulness of A.S. 
Council and the affordability of a 
UC education.

In lieu of flowers, it is 
recommended that donations be 
made to local independent media.

Senior, Revelle College

Dear Editor,
I was inspired by Roberta 

Alexander’s letter published Jan. 30. 
As an — ahem — somewhat 

advanced (old) scholar, I’ve been 
on a number of campuses all over 
North America. My parents are 
both Michigan alumni. Yes, I’ve 
been to The Big House (Michigan’s 
enormous football stadium). It was 
fun. I’ve got an undergrad degree 
from Queen’s University, Kingston, 
which has plenty of in-your-face 
school spirit. Interesting campus 
life: Fraternities/sororities are 
totally outlawed. College sports 
play a minor role at Queen’s, for 
most involved. But as an undergrad, 
the place crackled with rah-rah 
enthusiasm. You don’t need Greeks 
or The Big House for school spirit, 
just a particular brand of school 
spirit.

The idea that school spirit 
follows from elite athletics is 
contrived. School spirit emanates 
from the student body, not from 
branding, not from hero worship. 
The number of skateboards that 
locomote here is impressive! The 
student body runs co-ops, Che 
Cafe, Sun God and a fairly safe 
campus. Why leave Cal, Stanford 
and UCLA in order to promote the 
clamorous, libidinous company of 
the “college sports” fans? I’ll tell 
you why: to sell more merchandise. 
Why bother? Save your money, 
students!

lose sight of the more dire circumstances occurring here 
in the �oundering Golden State. �e �scal condition of 
California and its public schools is unique. 

Let’s look at the University of Alabama again. Despite 
$59 million lost in state appropriations, no employees at 
UA have lost jobs, had salary cuts or been furloughed, 
President Robert Witt said. With our cuts at 1 billion and 
counting, it’s safe to say that we are in a far di�erent place. 
So rather than compare ourselves to other universities, 
we should be looking critically at what our much stricter 
budget can actually sustain, which is what this bill is 
asking us to do.

And it’s not as though this bill eliminates the 
possibility of raises altogether. �e 5-percent wiggle room 
in the bill will allow us to hold on to our current talent, 
or seek executives on par with them. In essence, we can 
a�ord talent like National Medal of Science winner Marye 

Anne Fox now, so we should be able to �nd someone in 
her league at a 5-percent salary increase later.

Admittedly, there’s high competition for quali�ed 
university admin; we aren’t searching for replacements 
in a vacuum, especially if less-struggling systems are 
o�ering more. But the reputation of the California public 
university system and a more-than-decent salary given 
our hard times should be su�cient to yield a few willing 
candidates. Perhaps an increase in the percentage from 
a 5-percent cap to a 10-percent one would be a due 
compromise, allowing us to stay competitive nationally 
in the search for top executive talent while keeping an eye 
on our budget.

But it might be a moot point anyway. As admirable 
as Senate Bill 967 is, the timing is completely o�. CSU 
plans to hire six new campus presidents this year, and it’s 
unlikely that the bill would become law before the hires 
take place.

A “Bad” 
Ending Is 
Better Than 
None At All
F our seasons is enough to dub “Breaking Bad” one of the best televi-sion dramas out there. It’s the show 
that has been called “Weeds” on meth, 
the show that single-handedly changed 

everyone’s perception of Hal from 
“Malcolm in the Middle” and the show 
that taught fans to “respect the chem-
istry.” Season four ended with a bang, 
literally. Arguably one of the best season 
finales ever produced, the show made us 
question, again, the morality of Bryan 
Cranston’s evil protagonist. 

The good news is, the producers of 
the show have responded in kind, plan-
ning a 16-episode season five. The bad 
news is, season five will be the show’s last. 
Producer Vince Gilligan is ecstatic about 
this finality. For him, the opportunity to 
plan an ending, to fully, deftly end his 
story is a dream come true. 

This is a rather unusual request. One 
of the only other times that a hit televi-
sion show has deliberately asked for 
artistic license to, well, end its story is 
“Lost” in 2007. And though many, myself 
included, might believe that a conclusive

He’s  My Brother, She ’s  My Si s te rtake  the  L of t  to  the  theat re.
By Andre w W hit wor th •  Associate  Hiat us  Editor

I l lustrat ion by Jef frey  Lau/Guardian

L os Angeles sextet He’s My Brother She’s My Sister is no stranger to the stage. Indeed, two of the band’s performers own a successful the-atre company in Los Angeles, while two others 
are Hollywood actors (in fact, you might recognize cel-
list Satya Bhabba from his role as villain Matthew Patel 

in 2010’ “Scott Pilgrim vs. the 
World”). Upon experiencing the 
band’s live show, this dramatic 
background should come as no 
surprise, as He’s My Brother She’s 
My Sister attempts to make each 
performance a theatrical experi-
ence that transcends the boundar-
ies of an ordinary concert.

Lead singer and songwriter 
Robert Kolar took the time this 
week to speak with the Guardian 

over email about the band’s upcoming show, its aesthetic 
influences and the unrelenting theatrical quality of its live 
performances.

“I think it helps us appreciate showmanship and putting 
on a performance that can engage and hopefully sweep 
the audience away,” Kolar said. “Most audiences gravitate 
towards our live energy and instrumentation.  Plus we 
experiment live and throw in a spontaneous flair.” 

The band generally performs in whimsical costume, 
and the lineup includes a tap dancer who uses her shoes to 
emulate hi-hat and snare drums. 

“We are always exploring new ground with attire and 
various patterns, hats, make up, dress, stripes, glitter and 
beyond,” Kolar said. 

Indeed, the band feels that “most bands who dress in 
t-shirts and jeans [are] living in a rigidly defined aesthetic 
space,” a sort of creative stagnation that He’s My Brother 
She’s My Sister avoids through rigorous aesthetic reinter-
pretation.

On the musical side, the band draws from a compel-
ling list of influences. Referencing diverse artists such as 
T. Rex, The Everly Brothers, Howlin’ Wolf and early David 
Bowie, Kolar acknowledges that such musicians have “real-
ly shaped my end of the musical stylings of the band.”

Kolar also feels influenced by Los Angeles, the band’s 
home. 

“Any environment can have its influence,” Kolar said. 
“And certainly California makes its mark on us artistically. 
Traveling through the south, east, deserts, mountains and 
swamps have had a significant impact on us as well.”

The band is particularly excited about its upcoming 
debut LP (set for release on Pledge Music this spring), pro-
duced by Thom Monahan, who has worked with Vetiver 
and Devendra Banhart in the past. 

“The music out at the moment doesn’t quite capture the 
energy and instrumentation of the current lineup,” Kolar 
said. “This new record definitely feels like a proper intro-
duction to our sound.”

He’s My Brother She’s My Sister will bring its brand 
of flamboyant vaudeville folk to the Loft’s stage this 
Thursday, Feb. 2. The show begins at 9 p.m. and costs $8 
for UCSD students.

ending actually enhances its overall quality, some attention 
must be paid to television’s unusual form of storytelling.

By its very nature, television shows aren’t meant to end. 
One of the longest running scripted shows, “Days of Our 
Lives,” is a soap opera that has clocked 47 seasons and is 
still running strong. It’s the narrative that never quits nar-
rating, and writers who truly know their craft are the ones 
to make this happen. By gauging the audience’s approval 
or disapproval, television writers know just when to ax 
unpleasant characters (Nikki and Paulo from season two 
of “Lost” come to mind) and can tweak their show accord-
ingly. Without the luxury of a conclusive ending, writers 
can drag the story into a dead end and quickly turn it 
around, or just lose focus altogether (ahem, every season of 
“Heroes” after the first one). 

Still, I argue that many shows have dragged on for 

far too long. “How I Met Your Mother,” for example, has 
overstayed its welcome. Despite a built-in ending, there 
is no ending in sight (hint: At some point, it’s supposed 
to involve the mother); instead, the producers are milk-
ing their Neil Patrick Harris cash cow for all that it’s 
worth, destroying the liveliness of the story in the process. 
“Scrubs” almost avoided this issue. Its stellar eighth season, 
tapped as its final one, had a series finale that made fans 
forget the tepid 6th and 7th season entirely. But in an act 
where pride trumped good sense, creator Bill Lawrence 
allowed season 9 to happen, a pitiful excuse for a continua-
tion/spin-off that ruined the show’s season eight high. 

For this reason, I’m excited for “Breaking Bad”’s fifth 
and final season. After all, when “Dollhouse” was given 
notice that its second season would be its last, Joss Whedon 
cranked out one of the best examples of condensing a five-
season arc into one, defiantly ending his show on his own 
terms. Perhaps, control of destiny is for the best.

One-half of experimental 
power-pop giants 
Fiery Furnaces, Eleanor 
Friedberger took critics 
by surprise last year 
with her solo debut Last 
Summer — a summery 
gem brimming with the 
same ingenuity and heart

“THE ROOM” WITH TOMMY WISEAU
PRICE CENTER EAST / FEB. 5, 8 P.M. / $5

If “The Room” is indeed the “Citizen Kane of bad movies,” then writer/
director Tommy Wiseau is our modern-day Orson Welles. The film stars 
Wiseau as a down-on-his-luck Casanova who becomes tangled in a web 
of deceit, betrayal and one of the most confounding scripts in movie 
history. Come watch this o¨ensive, genre-defying, unintentionally surreal 
masterpiece of a disaster at Price Center this Sunday. Wiseau himself will 
be attendance. (RE)

“SPRING AWAKENING”
MANDELL WEISS THEATRE / FEB. 3-4, 8-11, 8 P.M. / $10

The beautiful and provocative 1906 play by Frank Wedekind that inspired 
the sensational Broadway musical is coming to UCSD’s Mandell Weiss 
Theater. “Spring Awakening” follows Melchior, Moritz and others in a 
group of adolescent boys at a German school as they discover the pitfalls 
of sex, love and the coming of age. (RE)

ALBUM REVIEWS

O n Paralytic Stalks, art-pop eccentrics of Montreal move from the Prince-like, 
guitar-heavy R&B sound of their 
most recent work, False Priest, 
into their darkest psychedelic 
circus yet. The powerful produc-
tion of the album hits you from 
the start — it features a heavier, 
almost shoegaze-esque sound high-

lighted with avant-garde, classical-
inspired orchestrations and catchy 
pop hooks full of lead man Kevin 
Barnes’ trademark melodic sass. 

Still holding on to the unhinged 
aesthetic of earlier works, of 
Montreal create contemporary 
soundscapes comprised of indus-
trial synths and organic strings 
that stress themes of insanity and 
doom.  It’s a sad album in that 
Barnes refers solely to his real life 
troubles. “Spiteful Intervention,” for 
example, is a spinning lullaby full 
of bizarre harmonies that lead you 
into the depths of Barnes’ troubled 
consciousness.  As he croons, “It’s 
fucking sad we need a tragedy to 
occur / To gain a fresh perspective 
in our lives,” a very personal side of 
the frontman surfaces.

 “Ye, Renew the Plaintiff,” a 
multi-part, Bowie-influenced eight-
minute jam, sees Barnes addressing 
his wife with all of his problems. 
Between great vocal shifts and 
compelling musical transitions 
(the track is like several songs in 
one), lyrics like, “How can I defend 
myself against this world?” and “I 
can think nothing but getting my 
revenge” sum up the thematic spirit 
of Stalks, leading to the beautiful 
second half of the album  — an 
ultimate release of numbing drones 
and hypnotic, driving vocals that 
lift us from the cacophony of 
Barnes’ troubled psyche, and back 
into our own.

O n third LP Tramp, the understated mournful croon of Brooklyn-based 
singer-songwriter Sharon Van Etten 
is nowhere to be found. After deal-
ing with insecure heartache on 

debut Because I Was In Love and 
sophomore LP Epic, Etten now 
sounds more self-assured than ever 
before. 

Tramp begins with three power-
ful numbers that showcase Tom 
Petty-esque strumming under 
Etten’s beautiful rasp, conjuring a 
charming sense of melancholy and 
mystery, while remaining atten-
tive to sharp, catchy songwriting. 
“Serpents,” the album’s first single 
(featuring the omnipresent Dessner 
brothers of The National), is lyri-
cally darker and more aggressive 
than much of her past work, com-
plemented by a driving cacophony 

of electric drums. 
But Tramp’s latter half drags, 

delving into lazier dream-pop songs 
that at times feel emotionally drain-
ing. With the help of a Fender uku-
lele and Beirut’s Zach Condon on 
back-up vocals, the album begins 
to regain some zeal on the excel-
lent track “We Are Fine.” It’s not 
quite enough to stir up the same 
engaging bravado of the album’s 
explosive first half, but it’s more 
than enough to keep us anticipating 
a more confident fourth release.

MOVIE REVIEW

When Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim announced that they’d be releasing a feature film, cult 
fans of the duo’s darkly genius Adult Swim 
sketch show “Tim 
and Eric Awesome 
Show, Great Job” 
reacted with both 
excitement and 
uncertainty. The 
venture seemed 
destined for one of 
two unappealing 
outcomes: It would 
either a) elongate the show’s 15-minute amal-
gam of fake PSAs, zero-budget commercials 
and absurdist pop-culture pastiche into an 
exhaustive feature length, or b) sift out its 
stranger, more refreshingly transgressive ele-
ments in the name of mainstream viability.

During the opening minutes of “Tim and 
Eric’s Billion Dollar Movie” — a commercial 
for the hazardous “Schlaaang Super Seat,” a 
faux-movie starring a Johnny Depp imper-
sonator, Jeff Goldblum as someone named 
Chef Goldblum — the former seems the case. 
But, as we’re swept into the film’s surprisingly 
cohesive plot, “Billion Dollar Movie” assur-
edly proves itself a new comedic experience 
all its own. 

The film follows two Hollywood won-
derkids (Tim and Eric) who — after blowing 
their billion-dollar budget on a three-minute 
flop — hide from their vengeance-seeking 
financier Tommy Schlaaang (a terrifying 
Robert Loggia) while managing a failing mall 
in an effort to raise back the money. 

What’s immediately striking about 
“Billion Dollar Movie” is just how unrelent-
ingly frightening it is. Similar to their recent 
non-“Awesome Show” outing, HBO’s “The 
Terrys” — the film ups the ante in terms 
of nightmare surrealism. In fact, much of 
“Billion Dollar Movie” draws directly from 
David Lynch: unnerving performances from 
non-actors and Lifetime-style cliches tinged 
with surreal horror. “Twin Peaks” star Ray 
Wise even drops in for a perfectly disturb-
ing cameo as the mall’s spokesman for a 
highly unsanitary new-age cult, while John C. 
Reilly’s sickly, feral mall guide Taquito could 
simultaneously haunt the recesses of any clas-
sic horror flick and land Reilly an Oscar for 
Best Supporting Actor. 

Though, as with the show, “Billion Dollar 
Movie”’s terror is perfectly counterbalanced 
by its countless moments of unorthodox 
hilarity. Zach Galifianikis is unsurprisingly 
outrageous as the duo’s pig-tailed spiritual 
guide, Jim Joe Kelly, and elsewhere the film 

revels in incredibly deadpan contemporary 
satire that might leave some of the older 
audience members wondering what the few 
bearded nerds in the front row are laughing 
about. 

That isn’t to say that each bit works. 
Often, the gross-out gags (spoiler: geni-
tal piercing) seem more unnecessary than 
shocking or funny. And Will Ferrell’s role 
as the “Top Gun”-obsessed mall manager is 
disappointingly flat. But these are a few brief 
moments in the shuffle of an entertaining, 
genre-defying piece of filmmaking.

To say “Billion Dollar Movie” is not for 
everyone seems like a vast understatement 
— as is the case with most any artists who 
poses something as new and defiantly un-
mainstream as Tim and Eric. And with both 
Heidecker and Wareheim beginning to test 
the waters of a wider audience (Heidecker 
will star alongside LCD Soundsystem’s James 
Murphy in this year’s “The Comedy”), noth-
ing could be more promising.

No. 14 women’s water polo goes 
2-1 in weekend tournament.
BY NICK HOWE
Associate Sports Editor

This past weekend, the No. 14 UCSD Women’s Water Polo team traveled to the University of Maryland to partici-
pate in the Terrapin Invitational. 

The team fared well in the tournament 
overall, going 2–1 to put the Tritons at 3–1 
for the season.

On Saturday, the team started strong as 
it handedly beat Wagner University in the 
morning match. Sophomore center Melissa 
Bartow put the Tritons ahead with the first 
two goals of the match; afterward, UCSD 
never conceded the lead.

Bartow scored back-to-back goals again 
in the beginning of the second period, bring-
ing the Tritons’ led up to 5–1. 

Sophomore Sara Lizotte quickly tacked 
on two more goals, while transfer junior 
Brittany Daniels scored her first goal as a 
Triton in the 11–6 victory.

But they couldn’t keep up the momentum, 
as the afternoon game saw the Tritons fall to 
Maryland University 14–6. 

Lizotte led the Tritons with four goals, 
with senior utility Natalie Peng adding two, 
but it wasn’t enough to stop the onslaught 
from undefeated Maryland. 

The two teams were tied at 4–4 after the 
first period, but Maryland pulled away, scor-
ing five goals in the second half to cement 
the victory.

Marist University — a squad that has yet 
to find a win this season — appeared out of 
its depth against the Tritons in the last match 
of the tournament. 

Lizotte came out red hot against the Red 

Foxes, scoring a career-high eight goals. 
But the first period had UCSD and Marist 

trading goals to tie the game at 2–2. Soon 
after, the Tritons capitalized on a Red Fox 
penalty that had them playing down five 
men to six. 

With the advantage, the Tritons finished 
back-to-back goals from Lizotte and senior 
center Kirsten Bates to turn the tide in the 
Tritons’ favor. 

The two squads battled in the first half, 
but a penalty shot made by Lizotte late in 
the second period opened the floodgates for 
UCSD. 

In the third quarter, the Tritons extended 
their lead to five. With just 18 seconds 
remaining in the period, Lizotte put away 
another goal to push the score to 12–8. 

Junior goalie Alexandra Taylor had a big 
night, blocking eight shots on goal and allow-
ing the Tritons to walk away with the 12–10 
victory.

For her role in leading the Tritons to a 3–1 
record, Sara Lizotte was awarded the KAP7 
Western Water Polo Association Player of 
the Week. 

Over the past four games, Lizotte has tal-
lied 20 goals and 5 assists, drawn eight ejec-
tions and shot over 58 percent. 

This is the second time Lizotte has been 
awarded the WWPA Player of the Week 
honor, after she was recognized last year as 
a freshman. 

The Tritons play the Red Foxes again at 
home in the Canyonview Pool at 6 p.m. on 
Feb. 10.

TOP OF THE ORDER

Despite losing four starters from last season’s NCAA Division II National Championship squad, the Tritons come into 2012 as No. 1. After taking the first national champion-ship in program history last season — winning 
their championship match against Alabama-Huntsville 10–3 
— the Tritons look set to pick up where they left off. The 
complete 2011 NFCA Coaching Staff of the Year returns, with 
UCSD head coach Patti Gerckens returning for her 20th sea-
son at the helm. The NFCA Coach of the year heads a squad 
replete with two All-West Region selections and the CCAA 
Freshman of the Year — all anchored by junior All-American 
pitcher Camile Gaito.

Gaito returns to the mound for UCSD after recording the 
fourth lowest ERA in the nation last season — just 40 runs 
in 47 appearances — leading the Tritons in their undefeated 
post-season run. The 5’4” pitcher is joined by senior All-
CCAA selection Kris Lesovsky, an outfielder and offensive 
mainstay for the Tritons, who returns as the lead-off hitter. 

All-CCAA Freshman of the Year Mya Romero will sit in 
as short-stop for UCSD. Romero will likely be relied upon to 
continue generating hits in her sophomore year, as her 46 hit 
record is second only to Lesovsky on the roster.

Sophomore outfielder Taylor Sepulveda — an All-NCAA 
Tournament team selection — also returns, along with sopho-
more catcher turned first baseman Caitlin Brown. 

Although UCSD’s young team is filled with talent, 
Gerckens concedes that the graduated seniors left gaps in 
the roster.

“We definitely have some big shoes to fill,” Gerckens said. 
“But we have some great players returning and we have a tal-
ented group of freshmen. But they’re young and they’ll need 
time to learn and mature.”

But Gerckens said she couldn’t attribute the Tritons’ mer-
curial rise from the 2010 season, where UCSD failed to even 
make the conference playoffs, to any one factor. 

“It was just so many variables and so many of our fresh-
men just came up big,” Gerckens said. “But our seniors — Jen 
DeFazio, Sara Woofter, Katrin Gabriel, in the postseason — 
the three of them were our driving force. They just harnessed 
everyone and got them to believe, and as we continued to win 
and pull out games in the last inning, the team just started to 
believe. Things just started to come together, and we just had 
a good bunch of athletes that had the right chemistry. Things 
just gelled at the right time: Our offense gelled at the right 

time and our defense, which had been strong the whole year, 
continued. And of course, to top it off, [Gaito] stepped up for 
us on the mound, and that speaks volumes right there.” 

The first game of the season against Northwest Nazarene 
will likely be the proving ground to find a replacement for 
third baseman Sarah Woofter. Woofter, who started all of her 
four years for the Tritons alongside graduated second base-
man Jennifer De Fazio, are two power-hitters that the Tritons 
will miss.

That is not to say UCSD is without a way to generate 
offense. One of the strengths of the Tritons is their versatility, 
giving Gerckens the option to either hit big or play small-ball.

Gerckens said the Tritons’ speed running bases is also a 
huge upside.

“Speed doesn’t go into slumps,” she said. “We want our 
athletes to be smart and aggressive on the bases. If we can get 
the defense thinking about the runner on base, that means 
that the catcher will be thinking about them stealing, which 
means that some of her emphasis is going to be taken away 
from the pitch-call. And the pitcher may be worried about 
people taking off. Our goal is to confuse them and make them 
think about us. And when you can force errors, it really can 
bring a team down.”

Gerckens’ emphasis on base-running is seen in the new 
additions, which include senior Annie Wethe, who spent her 
four years of eligibility as the starting center midfielder for 
the women’s soccer team. Wethe will be playing utility and 
primarily running bases. 

Other Triton newcomers include first baseman Monique 
Portugal and junior transfer right-handed pitcher Michelle 
Escamilla, who are both expected to make immediate impacts.

In the National Fastpitch Coaches Preseason Poll, the 
Tritons claimed the No. 1 rank yesterday, Wednesday, Feb. 1. 
UCSD received 16 first-place votes.

“We can’t look at it from the viewpoint that we’re cham-
pions,” UCSD assistant coach Jessica Millsap said. “It’s about 
doing what we need to do, playing the game we love and hav-
ing fun. We’re just excited, enthusiastic and we can’t wait for
