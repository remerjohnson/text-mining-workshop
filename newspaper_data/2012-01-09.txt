STUDENT ACTIVISM OBITUARY

CLICS to 
be Study 
Space After  
Break-in
Students can utilize former 
library until its upcoming 
classroom renovation.
BY NATALIE COVATE
Staff Writer

The Center for Library and Instructional Computing Services — more commonly known as CLICS — is now open as a study space for students. UCSD administrators reopened CLICS in response to a 
group of approximately 50 students who forcibly reclaimed the library dur-
ing finals week of Fall Quarter 2011. 

“In regards to students taking [back CLICS], I think they should take 
whatever’s theirs, in my mind,” Vice President of External Affairs Samer 
Naji said.

According to a statement signed by university administrators including 
Executive Vice Chancellor of Academic Affairs Suresh Subramani and Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs  Penny Rue, CLICS will remain a study space 
until the university renovates the library into classrooms. The date of the 
renovation is still unknown.

GRAD 
KILLED IN
MURDER-
SUICIDE 
BY ZEV HURWITZ
Staff Writer

UCSD graduate Karen Reis was 
among four killed in an apparent 
murder-suicide early New Year’s Day 
in Coronado. Reis, who graduated 
with a degree in cognitive science 
in 2009, her brother David, 25, and 
their friend Matthew Saturley all 
died from gunshot wounds inflicted 
by Navy pilot John Robert Reeves. 
Reeves then shot himself in the head.  

A Jan. 5 Los 
Angeles Times 
article reported 
that the four 
spent New 
Year’s Eve in the 
Gaslamp district 
before returning 
to celebrate at the 
Coronado apart-

ment where the shooting took place. 
Reis was a Warren College student 

who played for the Triton volleyball 
team. Most recently, she coached vol-
leyball at San Dieguito High School 
Academy in Encinitas and worked at 
a Trader Joe’s in La Jolla. 

According to an MSNBC Jan. 
5 article, San Diego Sheriff ’s Capt. 
Duncan Fraser is looking at a poten-
tial relationship between Reeves and 
Reis. 

“At this point we do not have a 
motive for these shootings,” Fraser 
said to MSNBC on Jan. 5. “There 
were no eyewitnesses.”

According to an online obituary 
provided by the Reis family, Karen 
had planned to become an occupa-
tional therapist.

Executive Director of UCSD 
Alumni Affairs Armin Afsahi 
released a statement last week 
expressing sympathy over Reis’ 
death.

“Upon hearing of the tragic 
events that occurred in Coronado 
over the weekend, we are very sad-
dened by the loss of a member of 
our UC San Diego alumni family,” 
Afsahi wrote. 

A candlelight vigil was held 
Wednesday, Jan. 4, at San Dieguito 
High School Academy in memory 
of its late volleyball coach. Another 
memorial for Karen Reis is planned 
for this week on campus.

Funeral services for Reis and her 
brother were held Saturday, Jan. 7, in 
Bakersfield.

IDLE WORSHIP

Students 
participating in the 
quarterly undie run  
during Fall 2011 
stop in their tracks 
to rally around a 
mannequin. 

The undie run — 
held Wednesday, 
Dec. 7 during 
finals week — 
began at Geisel 
Library around 
11 p.m. and 
continued down 
Library Walk to 
CLICS, where a 
few students 
found an entrance. 
It ended in the 
Revelle Fountain.

SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

Synethesia Benefits Creative Thinking
BY REBECCA HORWITZ
Associate News Editor

 
UCSD researchers have found evi-
dence that synesthesia — a neural 
condition in which the senses are 
jumbled and people can hear and 
taste words — has a physical basis, 
indicating that there is a genetic 
component to the condition.

Synesthetes experience words, 
colors and numbers as having 
sounds, tastes and colors. For 
example, the letter “B” could be 
seen as red in someone’s mind and 
“O” could be a white letter while 
the name Joyce could taste warm 
and savory.

Study co-author David Brang 
said the research team is look-
ing at the evolutionary benefits 
of synesthesia that have allowed it 
to survive natural selection. It is a 
trait that is not inherently useful 
so it hasn’t been selected for evo-
lution itself, but instead “tagged 
along” with another trait. 

The researchers used a tool 

called the Diffusion Tensor 
Imaging to see the connections 
between different brain regions, 
and found that the brains of syn-
esthetes are wired differently. 
Synesthetes’ brains have increased 
connections between the associ-
ated senses.

The visual images of these 
connections could help explain 
why some forms of synesthesia 
only move in one direction, such 
as seeing numbers evoke color but 
not seeing colors evoke numbers.

The images could also help 
scientists explore the theory that 
all humans have the neural mech-
anisms for synesthesia, but that it 
is suppressed in most people.

Studies have found that syn-
esthesia is seven times more 
common in artistic and creative 
individuals, leading scientists to 
think that synesthetes are better at 
bridging different ideas.

Brang said that a person who 
evokes colors from sound could 
listen to a musical piece and then 

paint what she sees, and it may be 
able to intuitively have the same 
significance for people who do 
not have the ability to see the 
colors. 

“Even though you and I may 
not have synesthesia, the asso-
ciation of some colors and some 
numbers or colors and sound 
may make sense to us,” Brang 
said. “If you were to look at a 
painting and see some dark pur-
plish sphere somewhere would 
you feel comfortable associating 
that with a flute or a bassoon? 
Most people would think a bas-
soon, a deep dark color would 
flow with a deep dark sound 
versus a wavering line for a flute, 
maybe a yellow color for a flute.”

Currently, the researchers are 
trying to discover whether syn-
esthesia is present in animals as 
well, or if it is present in humans 
only.

     Che Café held a benefit music 
festival from Friday, Jan. 6 to Sunday, 
Jan. 8. Tickets for the “I Promise” 
Festival — which hosted 24 bands 
over the three days — ranged from 
$10-$15 per day, with the Che 
hitting its full capacity of 200 people 
throughout the weekend.

Featured bands included Crystal 
Antlers, HEALTH and Griever. Each 
day of the festival was structured 
around a different genre (hardcore, 
indie, experimental) based on the 
music the cafe has supported. 

Scott Sanders of music booking 
company Spirit Animal Productions 
said that coordinating band 
schedules was the main challenge 
for the festival planners. He initially 
contacted 50 bands, but many of 

them were busy on tour or recording 
their music.

“A lot of bands wanted to commit, 
but it just didn’t work with their 
schedule,” Sanders said in an email.

For example, hardcore band 
Retox was scheduled to headline 
Friday’s festival, but ended up 
dropping the show. 

“There are always bound to be 
bumps in the road in setting up 
such a massive project, but everyone 
involved has been really supportive 
and knows that all of the work is 
worth it to save the Che,” festival 
organizer and co-founder of the Che 
Café benefit blog Jesse Kranzler said 
in an email.

According to Kranzler, all of the 
participating bands agreed to play 
for free, though the Café reimbursed 
travel and food costs. 

“We just reached out to a bunch 

of friends and bands we knew had a 
history with the Che or cared about 
the local DIY scenes,” Kranzler said

Prior to the festival, the Che Cafe 
raised $9,000 via donations from 
the Che Cafe benefit blog.  Kranzler 
said they expected to make another 
$7,000 during the festival. They will 
$12,000 by March for insurance fees 
to avoid being shut down.

“It’s important that people 
remember that [the cafe is] an active 
and welcoming place to go, perform 
their own music, set up their own 
shows and see bands they’ve been 
wanting to see for years,” Sanders 
said. “The Che is such a significant 
place and it has the ability to change 
people and give them a home to be 
comfortable in.”

Che Cafe Hits Capacity During Fundraising Concert

This student movement to reclaim 
CLICS was a response  to the library 
closing at the end of the 2010-11 aca-
demic year. Closing CLICS was esti-
mated to save the university $450,000 
this year alone — a fraction of the 
total $3 million cut made to the uni-
versity’s library budget according to 
the Feb. 17, 2011 Guardian article 
“CLICS May Close Next Year Due to 
Budget Cuts.”

“It’s the state and the state is 
not making us a priority,” Naji said. 
“They’re forcing these tough deci-
sions on the administration. When 
the administration is able to allow us 
to reclaim a study space, that’s a vic-
tory for students and for the admin-
istration in my opinion because it’s 
showing the state that neither party is 
doing OK with the cuts that are com-

ing down, and that adds pressure on 
the state [which makes them] more 
hesitant to cut the budget. “

Students had the support of Vice 
Chancellor Gary Matthews, who 
asked police officers to leave and not 
interfere with the movement. 

Subramani told the San Diego 
Union Tribune that the campus is 
prepared to overlook the forced entry 
and that administrators would not try 
to force the students out of the space.

A.S. officials involved in the 
movement assured faculty that stu-
dents would be responsible for pro-
viding security, banning alcohol, 
cleaning the space and ensuring that 
only UCSD students were using the 
space.

Administrators reminded the stu-
dents that there was a 24-hour study 
area available in Geisel Library during 
finals. Students responded that the 

area was crowded, noisy and isolated 
from other parts of campus.

While most students were inter-
ested in having the space to study, 
some also felt the break-in was a 
statement against budget cuts.

QUICK TAKES

The Los Angeles June ballot may feature a proposed initiative that would mandate porn actors to wear condoms in all productions �lmed in 
the city. Called “Safer Sex In �e Adult Film Industry Act,” the law aims at 
treating condoms in the adult industry like helmets in construction work or 
goggles in welding — as a mandatory safety precaution.  

�is initiative is intended to create a safer work environment for adult 
actors. �e AIDS Healthcare Foundation reports that adult �lm workers 
are 10 times more likely to be infected with sexually transmitted diseases. 
Herpes a�ects 66 percent of porn actors, and 7 percent of the actors are 
HIV positive. �ese mandatory precautions would decrease the chances of 
actors contracting such diseases, thereby protecting them and those who 
they come in contact with.

�e $12 billion-per-year adult industry has successfully fought condom 
law e�orts in the past. Opposition is rooted in a potentially negative impact 
on sales, as has been the case when adult production companies have previ-
ously instituted condom policies. Creating a safer work environment for 
these actors, however, is more important than potential revenue loss. One 
actor contracting a serious STD is all it takes to trigger a domino e�ect, 
which would not only jeopardize the health of all actors, but completely run 
the business to the ground.

Adult performers are members of the community, and this measure 
should become a standard public health law that the city strictly enforces.

A Condom Mandate is a Must to Keep Porn Industry Clean  New Condom Law In Los Angeles Will be Futile

A proposed ballot measure for the Los Angeles June 5 primary calls on the city to patrol the use of condoms in porn films. The movement 
towards reducing HIV/AIDS in the adult entertainment industry is well-
intentioned, but this measure is too expensive and weak to enforce.

It is unclear whether this measure can even be regulated by Los 
Angeles. The Los Angeles city attorney Carmen Trutanich announced that 
the city has no legal authority to require the industry to wear condoms and 
charge fees for inspections. The condom requirement can only be imposed 
by the state of California — a law that already exists at the state level in 
California, but has been difficult to enforce.

The state has been ineffective in enforcing this condom requirement, 
but that’s not to say that the adult entertainment industry is not taking its 
own steps towards disease prevention. The Free Speech Coalition, a trade 
association for the industry, argues that city intervention is superfluous, 
as the adult entertainment industry has its own testing protocols and 
regulations that are highly effective at preventing an HIV outbreak.

This measure is a concern for taxpayers because it will cost $4.4 million 
to put it on the ballot. In a time of fiscal crisis, the city of Los Angeles 
cannot afford to put expensive laws on the ballot that will likely prove 
feeble. According to the city, it has already received threats of lawsuits from 
the adult film industry, which will only inflate the financial burden of this 
ballot measure.

It is worthwhile to �ght against the spread of HIV, but change must 
come from within the industry, not the city.

My three faithful readers (mom, dad, Regina) may remember that this space 
once housed a media column. But last 
week, I decided that I no longer want 
to overanalyze Twitter each week, 
and would rather discuss men who 
want to have sex with very young girls 
(and other facets of human behavior). 
Hence, Field Notes. 
     Here’s the deal: In late December, 
psychologist Jesse Bering started a 
Scienti�c American advice explaining 

the evolutionary basis of readers’ 
dilemmas. His inaugural inquiry 
came from a middle-aged man who 
is attracted to young girls, doesn’t do 
anything about it and wonders why 
society’s big, bad age of consent laws 
try so hard to quash the almighty male 
sex drive. 

In answer, Bering cites research 
suggesting that such attraction may 
be biologically adaptive and explains 
that, historically, age of consent laws 
have been much more lax. He is  then 
vili�ed by everyone from the former 
SciAm editor in chief to Jezebel.com for 
being a rape apologist eager to unleash 
the world’s dirty old men onto the 
delicate �owers of the Disney Channel. 

Now, I’m a male privilege-accusing, 
Bechdel test-using feminist — but 
I don’t agree that Bering is a rape 
apologist for suggesting that being 
attracted to young girls may be 
“natural.” �e heart of the matter isn’t 
sex, but rather the concept of what is 
“natural” versus what is “moral.”

Evolutionary psychology — which 
argues that our psychological behaviors 
have evolved in certain ways to further 
reproduction —is o�en decried as 
pseudoscience that further racism 
(see: Satoshi Kanazawa’s Psychology 
Today articles about black women 
being unattractive). Plainly, the �eld is 
controversial, but there’s a di�erence 
between explaining a possible reason 
for one man’s attraction to young 
girls and condoning the use of that 
information to harm a young girl. 

Much of our actions today 
contradict their original evolutionary 
purposes. Just because we’re all put 
here to go forth and multiply doesn’t 
mean we’re forced to do so. And 
just because the man gets his kicks 
fantasizing about sixth graders, and 
may have an evolutionary basis for 
doing so, doesn’t mean he can act on 
desires in the face of the body of work 
showing the negative e�ect of such 
relationships.  Refusing to challenge 
our knee-jerk reactions compresses 
the dimensions of human behavior; 
and even if these seemingly dangerous 
theories excavate some desires 
societally deemed as “ugly,” we have 
the choice not to act on said desires.

Call me reductionist, but I believe 
evolutionary psychology o�ers one of 
the greatest opportunities to show true 
morality, and that what separates us 
from animals is not divine inspiration, 
but our ability not to be slaves to 
evolution, our ability to make choices 
and transcend against our so-called 
“best interests” and what a million 
years of programming told us to do.

Field 
        Notes

ANGEL

Our California legislators gave the state a hefty present this new year, ringing in nearly 760 new California 
laws beginning on Jan. 1. This package comes 
complete with more regulations that harm 
California businesses. When regulations 
burden businesses, job opportunities 
diminish. To a university full of students 
entering the workforce, these laws should 
concern UCSD.

At first glance, some of these new 2012 
laws might sound appealing, as several of 
them bring new benefits and protections 
for employees. New Department of Fair 
Employment and Housing rules make it easier 
for employees to initiate discrimination and 
harassment lawsuits against their employers. 
This extra protection is in place to help those 
who may be discriminated in the workplace, 
such as transgender or homosexual 
employees. Another law fines employers 
$5,000 - $25,000 if they “misclassify” an 
employee as an independent contractor to 
avoid paying state-mandated benefits. The 
threat of this fine could compel employers 
to classify more workers as employees and 
provide the required additional benefits. 

While these rules seem attractive to 
employees, they add costs and risks for 
companies. Tightening laws on independent 
contractors allows businesses to be fined on 
minor details, while failing to more clearly 
define the difference between independent 
contractors and employees. Independent 
contractor positions are beneficial to 
businesses because there is no wage 
withholding, no employment taxes and no 
liability for fringe benefits. By removing these 
financial burdens, companies are able to hire 
more employees, and thus creating a better 
job market in California. In a shaky economy, 
working as a contractor is a welcome 
opportunity for the unemployed — one that 
may shrink because of this new law.

If businesses can’t find ways to dodge 
the costs California tries to impose on 
them, they head for friendlier states, taking 
potential jobs with them. Carl’s Jr. CEO 
Andrew Puzder claims California’s current 
regulations make it too hard to open a new 
restaurant, so Carl’s Jr. will be opening future 
restaurants elsewhere. Puzder is not the 
only one. According to California relocation 
expert Joe Vranich, the number of companies 

leaving California has increased from one 
per week in 2009 to 5.4 per week in 2011. 
This mass relocation of businesses has sunk 
California to an employment deficit. Sadly, 
California’s deterrence to business isn’t letting 
up. Chief Executive Magazine annually 
asks 500 CEOs to rank the “best states for 
business.” California was ranked number 50 
in 2011 for the 7th year in a row, with many 
survey respondents citing the hostile nature of 
California’s state regulators.

Even companies that remain in California 
may not be hiring as much. Unemployment 
in California is currently at 11.6 percent — 
almost 3 percent higher than the national 
average. There could be many reasons for 
this, but the additional regulations in 2012 
won’t help the unemployment situation. 
Citizen Outreach president Chuck Muth puts 
it nicely: “Government regulations and rules 
make hiring an employee an expensive royal 
pain in the keister.” If a local business wants 
to hire a new employee, it better have the 
pockets to pay for prevailing wages, overtime 
rules, workers’ compensations, withholding 

The Fine Print
New state employment laws make it more costly for businesses to hire and operate in California — leaving 

fewer job opportunities for job seekers and the unemployed.

taxes, payroll reports, family leave rules, discrimination 
lawsuits, health care mandates, firing regulations…the list 
goes on and on. Job opportunities are artificially snatched 
away because employers cannot afford to hire.

These new burdens come during a time when 
employment after college is more important than ever. 
A typical student in 2010 owes an average of $25,250 in 
student loans, according to the Nov. 2 New York Times 
article “College Graduates’ Debt Burden Grew, Yet Again, 
in 2010.” Student debt, combined with the highest college 
graduate unemployment at 9.1 percent for the class of 2010, 
causes new California laws on employment to be under 
closer scrutiny.

The message from companies is clear: Excessive 

regulations make conducting business in the Golden State 
extremely difficult and costly. As a result, businesses hire 
less or even ditch California altogether, leaving fewer job 
opportunities for the unemployed. Companies must be able 
to hire in California without extra regulations and added 
costs — the exorbitant amount of California regulations 
should be reduced. Unfortunately, 2012 merely piles on 
more. Of course, repealing regulations is not exactly a bed 
of roses — it means we will have to accept fewer employee 
protections across the board. Some might say this is 
“progressing backwards,” but we must remember there are 
costs to regulations as well; repealing a decent chunk of 
them might actually be the most crucial step to increasing 
employment in California.

New Employment Laws Will Hurt Recent Graduates

QUITE FRANKLY By Lior Schenk

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Dear Editor,
I’m British — the land of the 

Queen and of the hit TV sitcom, 
“Skins.” I’d like to tell you my brief 
history. At 13 I lost my virginity. 
The next four years I partied, drunk 
copious amounts of alcohol and 
pursued promiscuous fun very 
successfully (the land of the Queen 
remember). In short, I avoided 
homework and instead caught 
chlamydia — or nearly.

At 17 I stopped. It was my last 
year of high school and I hit the 
library. I didn’t even attend my 
prom. Something changed. In fact, 
for my freshman year of college I 
did nothing but study. I scored the 
highest grade in my year. That’s 
not to say it was boring — I had 
a beautiful girlfriend, my acoustic 
band won the college competition 
and I flew back and forth to LA.

Still, why did it all change? Why 
did I receive a mug this Christmas 
that said “I love Spread Sheets!”? 
What happened to the party-loving 
me?  

We are continually faced with 
decisions. I, for one, am petrified 
about making the wrong one. A 
decision I make today feels like it 
could result in years of financial 
hardship or social leper-hood.

I strive to be the best — a 
Steve Jobs in the making and an 
Oscar-winning actor at the same 
time. I know I can’t be both but I 
want to be fantastic at something 
soon — I’m sure many of us know 
that feeling. But, I know that life is 
rushing by. 

Apples iconic man himself 
stated ‘“If today were the last day of 
my life, would I want to do what I 
am about to do today?”

The problem is that we can’t 
be at every social event in the 
world and also win a Nobel Peace 
Prize. Both take a lot of hard work 

of which we are limited in our 
capacity. At college, can we really 
party every night and wake up with 
a 4.0 GPA on the day of graduation? 
No, unless we are President Obama 
or James Bond — unfortunately I 
lack the handsome good looks for 
the latter. 

So what’s the advice? The only 
thing that pops up with predictable 
ambiguity is: Find the balance.  My 
life is tormented with that lovable 
word — some British sarcasm there. 

Where does the balance lie? 
At the extreme, the Independent 
reads, “the body of Sarah Napuk, 
the brilliant young Oxford student 
who took her own life, was found 
with her study schedule next to 
her,” and in the same breath, the 
LA times reads, “USC student falls 
from sixth-floor dorm window 
after attending rave.” Failing to 
find the balance can have serious 
consequences. 

In the end, which path will lead 
you to the presidency, to solving 
cancer or to finding that perfect 
family in the suburbs? Either way, 
it’s a continual struggle to get there. 

As students, we find ourselves 
anxiously trying to get that balance 
each and every semester and often 
we fail wonderfully. The solution? 
Well, of course I don’t know. But 
balance or imbalance, I will not 
give up.

O n Sept. 15, 2011, singer and actress Zandi De Jesus received news that hit her like a punch to the gut; at 27 years old, she was diagnosed with stage-three 
breast cancer. 

“I had to go get an ultrasound, and he said it was really 
nothing,” De Jesus said. “And then two months later, it grew 
into a huge mass that was extremely painful, and I’m the one 
who called the doctor and said, ‘I need another ultrasound. 
I need another scan. I need something — this is not right.’” 

Prior to the startling discovery, De Jesus, born and raised 
in Los Angeles to a musical family of �ve girls, was an Elea-
nor Roosevelt College student at UCSD, where she partici-
pated in just about everything — from working at I-House 
and as a Resident Advisor to involvement with ArtPower! She 
graduated in 2007 with a degree in �eatre. 

�e active student — who began singing at the age of two 
and eventually picked up the clarinet, tenor sax, piano and 
guitar — also made sure to stay true to her musical back-
ground.

While at UCSD, the innate musician formed a band called 
Zsos a�er meeting guitarist Justin Crisostomo in 2005 at an I-
House SLAM (Spontaneous Laughter, Art and Music) event, 

the �rst of which was organized by 
her now-husband Jin Namkung — a 
fellow RA at the time. �e duo later 
joined up with four other musicians 
to form Zandi and the Mercenaries of 
Funk. A�er gaining a large fan-base at 
UCSD, the band became popular on 
YouTube. �eir channel currently fea-
tures many acoustic renditions of pop 
covers and two original songs.

“I found that a lot of folks from 
out of country enjoy our music as 
well, especially from Brazil,” De Jesus 
said. “I’m really inspired by Brazilian 
jazz artists, like Antonio Carlos Jobim 
and Sérgio Mendes. �ey’re both re-
ally huge in�uences in my music; I 
grew up listening to them.” 

A�er college, De Jesus moved to 
New York City to pursue her acting 

career and toured the country as Macy Park in “�e 25th An-
nual Putnam County Spelling Bee,” a Tony Award-winning 
Broadway musical. �e 9-month tour, beginning in Oct. 
2008, was cut short for the expecting �rst-time mom a�er 
three months, when she returned to Los Angeles to give birth 
to her now two-year-old son, Max.

A little over a year a�er his birth, De Jesus received her 
cancer diagnosis. Now Max serves as the singer’s primary 
motivation to stay strong in her �ght. 

“[My son] reminds me that I need to beat this because I 
need to see him grow up and get through all his milestones in 
life,” De Jesus said. “�ere’s just so much ahead of me. I don’t 
want to let cancer get in the way of that.”

De Jesus then began raising funds for her treatment and 
recovery through her music and the generosity of her sur-

rounding community of family, friends and fans.
“A lot of people were donating money, which I thought 

was so generous and so supportive,” De Jesus said. “But I 
also wanted to give back in some way, so [my family, friends, 
bandmates and I] started thinking about fundraisers and 
bene�t concerts and doing an album together. We just wanted 
to give back to people who were giving to us.”

�e �rst fundraising event was a 3v3 Bene�t Jam at San 
Diego United Training Center, which showcased perfor-
mances by the breakdancing community in San Diego. �e 
event was put together on Oct. 1 by some of De Jesus’ good  
friends  while she was undergoing her �rst chemo treatment. 

“I was really, really blessed and touched because they 
didn’t even ask my permission to do it,” De Jesus said. “�ey 
went ahead and said, ‘Let’s help Zandi!’ �at was amazing.”

But De Jesus hasn’t stopped making music herself. She’s 
working on her own album (a release date is still to be deter-
mined), which will feature a fusion of di�erent styles, includ-
ing jazz, funk, soul, R&B and hip-hop. 

“�is is gonna be my �rst complete album as an artist,” De 
Jesus said. “I’ve been singing since I was two, but I’ve never 

actually put together an album. So this in itself is a huge ac-
complishment for me and something I’ve been meaning to do 
for my whole life.”

Aside from hoping to raise funds from her album, De Je-
sus said she hopes to inspire others and to be an example.

“It’s really a passion and dream of mine to be able to share 
my music with everyone,” De Jesus said. “So whether that 
means just my immediate community or my YouTube fans, or 
if that means signing with a record label — all of that would 
make me happy. But ultimately, it’s really about the process 
and being able to make the music and share the music and 
perform — to really bring people together and hear my story.” 

De Jesus is keeping her fans updated by maintaining a 
blog, cleverly titled “Once Upon a Boob...,” which she said 
helps her stay encouraged throughout her treatment.

“I think it’s really therapeutic to be able to write about the 
things that you’re going through, but the number one reason 
why I started writing was to keep friends and family in the 
loop,” De Jesus said. “And I’ve been told it’s inspirational to

people who have had cancer or are 
going through cancer right now as 
well. Every day when I blog, I let 
people in on the bad things I’m 
going through but also the good 
things I’m �nding through those 
bad things.”

De Jesus has already under-
gone four chemotherapy sessions 
thus far, which began at the end 
of September. Her last treatment 
is scheduled for the beginning of 
February, and a month later, she 
will have a double mastectomy, fol-
lowed by reconstruction and radia-
tion therapy. 

“I’m really, really thankful and 
grateful that I’m in LA where I 
can be treated at UCLA, which is 
a huge, amazing research facility 
that’s doing such good things in 
terms of cancer research,” De Jesus 
said. 

Despite having to deal with all 
the trials of her illness and its side 
e�ects, the cancer warrior main-

tains a positive outlook. With a 
good-humored shrug, she apolo-
gized for what she calls her “chemo 
brain,” a phenomenon that makes 
it di�cult to focus and hard to re-
member what you’re talking about 
mid-sentence. But chemo brain or 
not, her message is clear.

“Claiming that you’ve already 
won this battle is a huge part of 
the process because you can’t go 
through this acting defeated al-
ready,” De Jesus said. “You just 
always have to stay positive, and 
I think through my music and 
through this story, I want people to 
know that that’s important — to be 
thankful and to be positive.”

�e initial punch of the battle 
may have le� De Jesus temporar-
ily stunned upon impact, but it was 
unable to knock her down — an 
inferior contender against a per-
sistent spirit and the immense sup-
port of a loving community.

INFOCUS MOONKAM PROJECT

T he sky is no longer the limit for students who aspire to outerspace study. MoonKam, 
a project headed by the Sally Ride 
Science Academy in cooperation 
with UCSD undergraduate interns 
and the National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration (NASA), is 
offering a unique opportunity to 
middle student science programs 
across the nation, allowing them 
to participate in an actual NASA-
funded mission currently orbiting 
the moon. 

The MoonKam program is 
centered around the GRAIL mis-
sion, which consists of two space-
crafts  that were launched this past 
September. They’re equipped with 
cameras that are currently taking 
pictures of the lunar surface, in 
order to study the moon’s gravity in 
high precision detail.

Beginning mid-March until 
May, middle school classrooms can 
send in their requests to NASA of 
what specific part of the moon they 
would like to see photographed. The 
requests will filter to the mission 
control center based in UCSD, to be 
carried out with the help of UCSD 
undergraduate interns working on 
the project. 

The MoonKam project is the 
brainchild of Dr. Sally Ride, the 
first female astronaut in the United 
States, former UCSD professor and 
founder of the Sally Ride Science 
Academy with Dr. Karen Flammer, 
also a former UCSD professor. They 
began the project with the specific 
goal of promoting science education 
and public outreach. 

According to the creators, the 
idea behind the MoonKam program  
in particular is that by engaging 
young students in a tangible space 
project with visible effects, they will 
be more motivated to pursue their 
interests in science and technology. 

Undergraduate interns at UCSD 

will also benefit from the program 
by gaining a hands-on experience 
with a NASA project. Interns com-
ing from a broad range of concen-
trations will work on all aspects of 
the MoonKam sector of GRAIL, 
from the actual work of positioning 
the spacecraft, to handling the web-
site design for request-processing. 

“We believe that if you just give 
students the opportunity to be 
involved with science, excite them, 
let them ask questions like, ‘How 
was the moon formed? Why does 
it look the way that it does?’ and be 
able to actually take part in answer-
ing those questions, we will be able 

to capture those budding interests 
in science, math and technology,” 
Flammer said. 

So far, over a thousand schools 
have registered with the MoonKam 
project, taking advantage of the 
opportunity to nurture the inquir-
ing minds of the space physicists of 
tomorrow. The creators hope that 
even more classrooms do the same.

More information on the 
MoonKam project and a registration 
portal can be found at moonkam.

10 THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  MONDAY, JANUARY 9,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

BY RACHEL UDA & NICK HOWE
Sports Editor & Associate Sports Editor

MEN’S BASKETBALL — The Triton Men’s 
Basketball team struggled through winter 
break as the season reached a crisis point. Last 
Friday, the Tritons dropped to 1-6 in confer-
ence, losing in overtime to Chico 78-72. The 

following day, UCSD fell again in Turlock, as 
it trailed Cal State Stanislaus 66-56 when the 
final buzzer brought the game to an end and 
the Tritons fell to 1-7 in the CCAA. 

At the beginning of the season, Coach 
Carlson emphasized that the strength of the 
UCSD program was in its recruitment of ath-
letes that are more intelligent than the com-
petition. Not only does the average UC San 
Diego student score over 200 points higher 
than their CCAA counterparts on the SAT, 
Carlson said that they also had better basket-
ball smarts. That is, the ability to know what 
to do in game-time situations in order to win. 
This strength, coupled with a good work ethic 
and an emphasis on defense, was how UCSD 
was going to win games against schools with 
larger recruiting budgets and lower admis-
sions standards.

Sitting in the meat of the season, the 
Tritons have not followed through on their 
preseason promise. Last Friday against Cal 
State Stanislaus, the Tritons played well 
enough to go toe-to-toe with the Warriors

Junior Tyler McGrath had the best game 
of his career, scoring 19 points while shooting 
33 percent from behind the arc and sinking 
six of his seven free throws. Senior Mike Meza 
also contributed 15 points to go along with 
sophomore James McCann’s 14 points and five 
assists. But the boards have been the root of 
what is truly hurting the Tritons. McGrath, 
a shooting guard, totaled five rebounds — as 

many as center Christian Hatch — and the 
Warriors out-rebounded the Tritons 29-46

This discrepancy allowed for the Warriors 
to shoot an atrocious 29 percent from the 
field, because they were always getting second 
looks at the basket.

Cal State Stanislaus’ big gun, senior 6’9” 
center Reggie Jones, scored 31 points and 
pulled down 14 rebounds. He also managed 
to largely shut down Triton senior as well, 
team points and rebounding leader Christian 
Hatch, who finished with only nine points and 
five rebounds, compared to his usual double-
double.

In overtime, the Tritons lost on free throws 
as they hacked at Cal State Stanislaus into hit-
ting 14 of 18 from the line.

Last Saturday against Chico State, the 
Triton defense fell apart, allowing the Wildcats 
to shoot 48 percent from the field and hit 11 
of 20 three-pointers, 55 percent from behind 
the arc. 

At the beginning of the year, Coach 
Carlson said that if the team could play 
defense, it could run with any team in the 
country. The Triton defense has not lived 
up to expectations, and without a superstar 
offense, the Tritons have struggled to keep 
pace with the more talented and more athletic 
CCAA teams. With the win, Chico improves 
to 5-3 in the CCAA while UCSD drops to 1-7.

Senior Justin Brue finished with his first 
career double-double with the kind of hustle 
that the Tritons need from every player in 
order to win, scoring 12 points and pulling 
down 10 boards. Hatch meanwhile had 12 
points and six rebounds. He struggled from 
the floor, making only 3 of 10, but made it up 
from the free-throw line where he sank six for 
six.

Second Team All-CCAA last year, Wildcat 
senior Jay Flores led the game in scoring with 
17, hitting three three-pointers — two of them 
back-to-back down the stretch to solidify 
Chico’s hold on the lead and shift momentum 
away from the Tritons for good.

The Tritons did rebound better in the 
game, nabbing 28 boards to Chico’s 29, but the 
defense was so poor that the Wildcat offense 
rarely missed anyways. 

In the end, basketball comes down to which 
team can put the ball in the basket more times 
than the other team can. The Triton men’s 
team has failed to hustle, box out and make 
short layups, resulting in massive rebounding 
deficits and subsequent losses. Athletically, 
there is no excuse for being out-rebounded. A 
5 ft. guard can box out Yao Ming. Rebounds 
are either the result of height and athleticism 
or discipline from everyone on the court to 
commit to boxing out on every shot. Quite 
simply, as of late, the Tritons have fallen short 
on all counts. 

UCSD now needs to prepare for its next 
game on Friday against Cal State East Bay, 4-3 

in conference play. The Pioneers have shown 
flashes of brilliance this year, beating No. 6 
nationally ranked Cal Poly Pomona two weeks 
ago. The Tritons will have a big test matching 
up against junior guard Mark Samuels, who 
throws up big points and dishes the ball well. 
However, the Pioneers do not have any starters 
over 6’5”. The Tritons should out-rebound Cal 
State Stanislaus, which has no good players 
over 6’5; they should be able to drop the ball 
down to Hatch for some easy points and they 
should out-rebound the Pioneers for the win.
But those are some dubious “should”s.

UCSD Basketball Undefeated

BY RACHEL UDA
Sports Editor

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL — After 14 regular season games, 
the No. 3 UCSD Women’s Basketball team remains unde-
feated. 

The Tritons, who returned every player from last year’s 
roster, were picked to win the conference from a poll taken 
by the CCAA coaches — and for good reason. So far, UCSD 
has won all of its league games by an average margin of just 

over 22 points. 
Its closest competition this season was in the last away 

trip against Chico State.
Last Saturday, Jan. 7, UCSD came from behind to force 

overtime. The Tritons cut a six-point Wildcat lead with just 
five minutes left on the clock. 

Still down by two, in the last possession of the regulation 
time period, senior guard Chelsea Carlisle came up with a 
steal and finished with a layup on the other end to tie the 
game at 70.

The lead changed hands five times in the overtime peri-
od, and Carlisle looked as if she would secure the win with 
a layup that put the Tritons up 80-82 with just five seconds 
remaining. 

However, the Wildcats caught the Tritons on their heels, 
and Chico’s McKenzie Dalthorp equalizing with one second 
left on the clock. 

In the second overtime period, Chico seemed to have 
run out of steam, as UCSD raced out to a six-point lead with 
little resistance, ending the game 91-97.

“That was an unbelievable effort from our group tonight,” 
head coach Charity Elliott said to the UCSD Athletic 
Department. “We simply refused to lose. We were down and 
we weren’t shooting very well from the perimeter, but we 
kept battling and we found a way to win against a very good 
Chico team.”

UCSD’s starting five all recorded double figures, with 
junior guard Emily Osga and sophomore forward Erin 
Dautremont leading the team in scoring with 23 points 
apiece. Carlisle and senior forward Lauren Freidenberg 
both chipped in 14 points, with senior shooting guard Daisy 
Feder knocking down 18 points.

On Friday, the Tritons took a comfortable 22-point win 
from bottom of the conference Cal State Stanislaus, beating 
the Warriors 83-61. Elliot took the game as an opportunity 
to develop the bench, with the scoring distributed through-
out the roster. Feder and Carlisle were the only two Tritons 
to record double figures, while freshmen Natalie Luzar and 
Dana Webster both scored eight points apiece. 

“We set the tone in the first five minutes and really built 
on things from there,” Elliot said. “It truly was a team effort 
tonight and it was great to see some of our younger players 
get an opportunity and do some really good things.”

The Tritons sit at the top of the conference standings, 
with an 8-0 conference record and a 14-0 overall record. 

Next Friday, UCSD will face Cal State East Bay (2-5), 
before taking on the only other undefeated CCAA team, 
reigning conference champions Cal State Monterey Bay 
(7-0), next Saturday, Jan. 14.

Hillary Williamson: Daktroniks West Region All-Star Second 
Team, First Team All-CCAA; Katie Condon: Second Team

Women’s Volleyball — By any other team’s standards, 
UCSD would have had a pretty remarkable season. The 
Tritons put together a 22-6 record and fought their way to the 
regional semifinal before losing to nationally ranked Sonoma 
State. However, the women — ranked as high as No. 11 
nationally —were looking for a National Title.

The team struggled to find its groove against unranked 
teams and sometimes played down to the level of other 
teams. However, when they were on, the ladies could put 
together some serious game. Now, with four new recruits 
and a number of solid underclassmen, the squad has a good 
foundation to make another run for the playoffs next year. 
Their next chance at a National Title may not come for a few 
years as their talent recovers from losing seniors Roxanne 
Brunsting, Katie Condon and Hillary Williamson.

Men’s Water Polo — For the first time in five years, the 
men’s water polo team qualified for the national tournament, 
stealing the berth from first-seeded Loyola Marymount and 
winning the conference championship.

Having placed four players on the All-Conference team, 
juniors Brian Donohoe and John Butler and seniors Graham 
Saber and David Morton, Morton was named the tournament 
MVP. The Tritons seemed to be peaking at the right part of 
their season, but first-round opponent No. 1 UCLA was never 
going to make it easy. The Bruins faced UCSD on one other 
occasion, beating the Tritons 9-4 without even fielding their 
top-scorer Cullen Hennessy. 

But on Dec. 3 in the national semifinal bout, UCLA came 
out full-force, taking an 11-1 win from UCSD, with Hennessy 
putting three past Morton.

The Tritons ended the 2011 season with a narrow 9-7 loss 
against Princeton in the consolation game.

WOMEN’S SOCCER

Record: 13-3-4, 12-1-3 in conference (1st in 
CCAA, lost to Chico State in the second round 
of the NCAA Division II Championships).

Honors: NCAA Division II participant, 
Sarah McTigue: NSCAA All-American Third 
Team, All-West Region Daktronics First Team, 
All-CCAA First Team; Kristin Armstrong: 
NSCAA All-West Region First Team, All-CCAA

Region Third Team, CCAA Newcomer of the 
Year.

Women’s Soccer — UCSD’s anticlimactic 
second-round exit from the NCAA national 
tournament was a surprise, if only because 
the normally dominant Tritons failed to meet 
expectations in their 2011 season. 

Last season’s women’s soccer team was the 
culmination of four years of head coach Brian 
McManus’ primping and polishing, with 10 out 
of its 11 starters returning from 2010’s national 
runner-up squad.

McManus is fond of saying that the Tritons, 

who have made post-season appearances in all 
ten of their seasons since moving to Division 
II — have become accustomed to playing with a 
target on their backs. UCSD went undefeated in 
its first 12 games and finished at the top of the 
conference going into the CCAA tournament, 
but for the third year in a row, the Tritons were 
picked to win the conference title, and for the 
third year in a row were knocked out of the 
conference tournament by lower-ranked teams. 
Fortunately, the Tritons by then had amassed a 
13-3-3 record that guaranteed UCSD the No. 1 
rank in the West Regionals, where they met with 
CCAA opponent Chico State. 

The Wildcats scored midway into the first 
half, while the Tritons failed to convert any of 
their 14 shots and were eliminated from the 
tournament.

“It was just one of those days,” McManus 
said. “The ball wasn’t going to go into the back 
of their net.”

It’s obvious that next season will be a 
rebuilding year for UCSD, who lost five starters 
— including All-American Sarah McTigue and 
All West Region selections Annie Wethe, Shelby 
Wong and Kristin Armstrong. McManus will be 
busy filling the gaps, which will include finding 
a goalkeeper, as Armstrong and the team’s only 
other netminder senior Sarah Garland graduates 
this year.

MEN’S SOCCER

Record: 10-8-0, 9-7-0 in conference
Honors: Alec Arsht: NSCAA All-West 

Region Third Team; Cory Wolfrom: NSCAA 
All-West Region Third Team

Men’s Soccer — Inconsistency has 
consistently marked the men’s soccer team 
in the past few seasons. Although under the 
helm of head coach Jon Pascale the Triton men 
garnered winning records in their past two 
seasons, they still find themselves all too often 
underperforming against bottom-ranked squads 
in the same weekend that they rally to top 
league-leading Sonoma State.

The failure of the team to find a rhythm 
could be attributed to the youth of the squad. 
Certainly, kinks need to be worked out, 
assignments better understood and roles more 
precisely defined, but these are things that 
will come with more experience. The Tritons 
amassed a 10-8-0 overall record last season, 
losing three straight games before winning their 
last four matches.

If there’s one thing that can be said about 
this particular squad, it’s that they’re resilient, 
and will be making a serious run at the 
conference finals next season.

The UCSD Swim and Dive team had several 
standout performances over the weekend meets. 
On Friday, Jan. 5, both the Triton men’s and 
women’s teams faced Division I competition 
— the women’s team met with Texas 
Christian, San Diego State, Rice University and 
Washington State while the men dueled Texas 
Christian. 

Freshman Jaclyn Amog had a particularly 
good showing, taking first in the 100m butterfly 
with a personal best of 57.04, moving up to 
sixth place on UCSD’s top 10 list for the 100m. 

Senior All-American Alex Henley landed 
the Tritons on the podium with a second place 

finish in the 200m backstroke with a time of 
2:03.11, narrowly losing the gold to San Diego 
State top finisher Leona Jennings — who 
recorded a time of 2:02.49. 

Despite losing 165-135 to Texas Christian, 
the Triton men’s team came out with better 
results than the women, placing five top 
finishers. Diver Tyler Runsten snagged two 
gold medals, finishing first in the 1m dive 
and 3m dive with scores of 297.40 and 323.20, 
respectively. Sophomore Nick Korth won the 
200 IM, along with sophomore Alex Merrill 
who won the 200m freestyle and senior Max 
Herman who took the 1000m freestyle. 

The No. 1 ranked Tritons hosted their final 
home meet of the season on Saturday, Jan. 7 
in a dual meet against No. 3 Grand Canyon 

University. The men’s and women’s teams split 
the scores, with a 159-103 win on the women’s 
side and a 146-116 loss on the men’s. 

Henley stole the show on the women’s 
end, taking first in all four of her races — the 
200m butterfly (2:05.57), the 200m backstroke 
(2:04.95), the 200 IM (2:07.46) and was a part of 
the winning 400m medley relay team (3:53.25) 
with Among, Neda Nguyen and Anji Shakya. 

The men’s team dominated at long distance 
swims, sweeping the top three spots in both 
the 500m and the 1000m freestyle events, with 
Herman taking first in both races with times of 
4:45.96 and 9:56.75, respectively
