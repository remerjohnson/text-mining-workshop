Enough! 
Enough! The trivial lengths to which this year's A election'>

if any confidence in next year's council is to be sal" aged from thi" 
wholly unnecessary mess. 

T he result of a ll this legal and extralegal manueverin~ by 
David Tollner's S"'W"'A·M"'P late and Marcy Jaffe\ 'tudent 
Act ion late can on ly undermine the already shaky ground upon 
which t he AS is built. The credibility of the institutIOn of student 
gcwernment has already been reduced in the eyes of UCSD 
students: the credibility of the lJCSD undergraduate populatiun 
a'> a whole ha~ been Irre\ersibly blemished in t he eye" of the 
community at lar~e. 

And *W*A*M*P and tudent ActIOn are not \J,.hol!\ at fault. 
The A. Judicial Board, acting on neither legal prt.'Cedence nor 
With common sense, overruled the AS Election Commi"wl!1's 
ruling that suspended tudent Action from c(lmpaignll1g 
because of "unfair" camoaum literature alleging Tollner had 
been "endor:,ed" b\ the CARP "l\100ntc:-. .. The judicial board\ 
ruling centered on the interpretatIOn of the word "endor~ed." 
and its member~ deCided sl1ch a term \\as hardly Itbelous. The 
sentence that followed - and 10 which the board apparently had 
no concern - Ims 10 poor taste and worthy 01 dl'l'lpltne. It 
e~('apes us why the board iJ~nored thiS while focustng on the 
fmolous defmit ion of "endorsl>d .. 

Both slates hayc acted IrratIOnally. immaturely. and Without 
regard for the well being of LTC,:)I)'" undergraduate populatIOn. 
The Judicial board. tal). acted In a manner far from judiCial 
prudence and has contnbuted tu thiS compromise of student

Keeping it up 

Let's face it: fat people have no reason to live 
"Should a woman wit h 50" 

hips," asks a Los A11f(efes 
Tillles article , "wear designer 
jeans?" 

The question, you' ll agree, is 
unmistakenly misguided. The 
query ought to be: "Should a 
woman with 50" hips - have 
50" hips? 

No. No woman hould have 
50" hips, nor ' hould any man . 
And nobody' s goingtodisagree 
with me thi s time. What have 
we come to? Sometimes we 
can 't see the forest for the 
trees. Our world 's gone topsy· 
turvy in its doomed·to·fail 
espousal of any and all mi sfits 
and aberrations . 

It 's gone too far. Fat we can 
do without. 

r have before me a "Dear 
Abby" clippi ng. The bereaved 
writer, a di straught person 
who signs herself apt ly, "Fat. 
Fe male , and Mi erable ," 
writes: 

"Dear Abby: Do you know 
what it' , like to: 

- Squeeze int o a theater 
~('at, and sit in agony during 
the entire performance while 
t he sides of t he seat dig into 
your thighs ? 

- Shop in a grocerv "tore 
and ha\'e people watch to see 
what you put in your care 

- Walk into a restaurant 
and wonder If you' II fit into the 
boot hs or cha I r? (O r \\ orse vet. 
go to somcone's home and pray 
there wi)) be a chair that's 
st urdy enough to hold you?) 

- Wonder if maybe you 

wouldn' t be hell er off dead?" 
The fat and misera ble 

fem ale has a point. 
Now, though I'm a cedu lous 

reader of Abby's and have to 
usually admire her studied 
and sy mpatheti c re ponse. to 
a forlorn corre pondent, it 's 
obviou that Abby has to pull 
punches in t he interest of 
maintaining her lucrative 
nationall y sy ndi ca ted sob 
column. She has to tread 
lightly in her goal to soot he 
and sy mpathi ze. e\'en when 
she knows she's not doing a 
wretched reader any fa vors in 
the long run . If Abby hits them 
wit h Realit y Therapy and calls 
a spade a spade , she's had it. 

But we don 't care to be 
lull ed. You decide. Is it 
actually a favor to direct the 
fat person, as Abby so 
ruthless ly did, to the National 
AssociatIOn t o Aid Fat 
Americans Inc., of unfortu· 
nate Bellerose, New York? 
"Thi s is a group of frankly fat 
people," Abby notes, "w ho 
have banded toget her for the 
purpose of helping the ()he~e to 
accept themselves a ... thev 

" . 

are. 
That's not good ad v ICl'. dear 
I~eader: that's doing \ lolcnce 
to the -.enslbihtH's of all of uo.; 
rational people With properl)

psyche~. 
We're forced to ask \\ here 

sLlch Idea~ come from. Who 
hasn't noticed of late quite a 
few -;trateglcally·placed 

advertisements In the 
newspaper that announce Fall 
Fashions for "the full·figured 
woman." Eagleson's is the 
clothing store for "big and tall 
m n ," pandering to a portly 
pu blic of fat males. Depart 
ment store catalogs now even 
offer a couple of s lick pages of 
sackcloth wraparounds for 
fatties. 

This all bespeaks a kind of 
distortion and degeneracy of 
dignity. [s it, after all. dignified 
to be fat? 

Absolutely not: no one can 
deny that obesity is one of the 
few maladies over w hi ch we 
have great control. Fat people 
might , at best, get pity - but 
not sy mpathy. 

But you're angered by me 
seeming ca ll ousnes, and 
in ensitive condem nation of 
fat persons . Don', get me 
wrong: I do realize that there is 
such a thing as a hereditary 
predisposition to grossness. 
But. barring the very 
occasional endocrine or ot her 
organ ic et iology O\'er \V hich we 
ha\'e scant control, there's

American populace IS 01'\\'1)) be

problem? 
Part of the answer. a ... YOU 

can "(''e, may he m the ab'surd 
tendency to' "accept" fat ne~s 
We don't even call it hke It IS 
anymore. The "portly man" 
and the "full·flgured woman" 
are just euphemism~ for 
dirigib le. 

Anot her ans", er 111lght be in

to compen:-,atc or subhmate 
"'Ith food when one IS afflictl'<i 
by emotional disorder" But 
hold it -dodging the issue and 
appealing to "higher 
psychological motivational 
factors" or termmology like 
"subliminal compensatory 
urge" are just su bstitutes for 
sloth and lack of dic;clphne.

AS shows dislike of Attiyeh appointment 

Past connections with CIA are brought to question, and defended. 
By ROB HOWARD 

The ASUCSD cou ncil voted 
8-4 last Wednesday night to 
oppose professor Richard 
Attiyeh's recent appointment 
as the new Dean of Graduate 
Studies and Research. The 
decision was made in light of 
Attiyeh's past cooperat ion 
with the CIA through 
economic research he 
conducted while at the 
Inst itute for Policy Ana[ysis 
(lPA). 

For over two hours. the 
economics professor spoke and 
responded loquestionsdealing 
wl1 h the activities of the [PA, 
the non-profit organizat ion of 
\\ hich he \\-as a director. 

"The nature of t hiS research 
is JI1 no way secrel, it's enl irel), 
public and above board," 
com mented Attiveh. "At lhat 
lime. t he CIA wa-;; oneof many 
government agencies advi 
sing our it S) negotiators of 
the U. 's position on tariff 
reduct ions, which were being 
considered by most of our (t'. ) 
Irading partners to promotr 
free trade in most of the 
l'Con0111 ies of t he world." 

According to Attlyeh, the 
CIA was simply an intermedi 
ary, ask i ng the IP A to perform 
a specifiC economic "tudy on 

behalf of other governmental 
groups - such as the. tate 
Department and Treasury. 
The purpose of the [PA was to 
analyze the effect on trade 
flows of certal n pol ICY 
instruments such as tariffs 
and quotas. Attiyeh Said. 

Others present at the AS 
meeting felt the CIA's 
intentions were less noble. 
"The type of activit y t hat he 
did directly affected the price 
manipulations (and) the trade 
wars that the United States 
and the CIA took against Chile 
in 1973," stated Reggie 
Williams. A Commissioner. 

Mo~t AS mem bers agreed 
they lacked enough informa 
tlon to judge the ramifirat Ions 
of Attll'eh's work at the [PA 
MemJJers did, however, agree 
that the IPA 's connection \\'llh 
the CIA was, in itself. an 
adequate reason to protest 
Attiyeh's appointment. 

George KastJaficas, head of 
the movement to protest 
Attlyeh's appointment. feared 
that such nght wing politics 
would endanger the academic 
neutrality of L CSO. Kastia 
ficas also expressed concern 
over "the le\'el that . I udent., 
will now be recruited into the 
CIA from the campus." Most 

AS board upholds 
Jaffe slate ruling 

In a 4·U deCision, the 
ASUCSD Judicial Board 
voted last night to uphold a 
decision to invalidate last 
Wednesday 's loting. and to 
maintain charges Ihat the 
Student Action Slate libeled 
presidential candidate 
DaVid Tollner in a flyer 
campa ign. The board, 
meanwhile, reI ersed a 
deciSIOn which would hale 
pre\{'nted the Student 
Act ion late from camp-
aignlllg during the final day 
of dect ions t odav. 

During the four hours of 
te..,timony, the board 
listened to e\'idence -
submitted bv both the 
Student Actie)n Slate and 
Tollner - which centered 
arou nd t he use of a Student 
Action Slate flyer which 
publicized the 'Moonies' 
endorsement of Tollner. 

While both side agreed 
that the 'Moonies' did 
display a sign which 
endorsed Tollner. the two 
Sides did not agree that the 
endorsement was a legit -
imate endor~ement. 

Tollner urged the board 
to consider the term 

"endor~ement" accord!ng 
to it's procedural use III the 
elect ion codes - and not Its 
common-sense lise. (The 
procedural use of "en-
dorsement stipualtes that 
an org(lnizat ion must fde 
the proper paper work to 
become a legitimate 
endorser, which the 
'Moonies' did no!.)

Kakishlba, Stephen Has·

The tenure denials of MUir 
professor Tony Ngubo and 
History professor Emory 
Tolbert were likeWise thought 
by KastJaficas to be a result of 
the University's conservat ive

HaDllll eyes a few changes 
in DC and state budgets 

B ... HENRY SCHl1LMA~ 
\acramento Corn:'pondenl 

LegIslative Analyst Willtam 
Hamm recently presented 
legislator., a smorgasboard of 
opt ions t hey could take to cut 
up to S2.5 billion from the 
state's budget , including o\,er 
$1 0 million from the 
University of California. 

Hamm, the [egis[at ure's 
non-partisan budget reviewer, 
mdicated in his 300-page 
report his list was not meant to 
be a specific proposal. but 
instead is an option paper 
offering suggested cut from 
which legislators can pick and 
choose to help offset a major 
shortfall expected for next 
year's budget. 

According to the report, 
ISSUed Monday. the unil'ersi 
ty's budget could be cut: 

- $ 7.3 million by 
increasing t he student ·teacher 
ral10 from 17-1 to 20·1 and the 
:-,tudent-TA rat'lO from 44 I to 
50-1, resulting in the lo~s of 
231 TAs and 88 teachers; 

- :11.1 million by 
Increasing non -rrsldent 
graduate tuition by $1,500. 
and establishing resident 
graduate and undergraduate 
tuition of 5500 and $250 per 
year respectively ; 

- $18 million b} Jl1creaslng 
studt'nl fees $150 per year, 
thereby making student 
services totally .tudent-
supported; 

$12.3 million In 
adm inistrative cost s; 

- 6.2 millton In eqUipment 
replacement and deferred 
main tenance: 

- and 17 Y millton by 
eillninat 109 \ arious re"earch 
and Itbrary programs. 

lf all the e proposah were 
accepted by the Legislature, 
the university's budget would 
be reduced by 182.5million-
nearly 20 percent of the state's 
l.TC appropriation. Legl!:;)at ive 
and un!\l"rsit\ source __ all sa\ 
the Un!\ ersil'} can expect a 
budget cut below the 25 
percent Go\' . Brown suggested 
for next year. but that

Protestors hold rally against 
draft board training sessions 

By SCOTT YOUNG 
Members of the Committee 

Against Regi t rat ion and the 
Draft (CARD) held a rally and 
picket to prote t the training of 
volunteer members of the new 
draft board last Thur day at 
the Catamaran Hot el in 
Mission Beach. 

About 150 people, including 
members of Women 's Peace 
Action, Student for Peace at 
San Diego State, the Women's 
International League for Peace 
and Freedom, the San Diego 
Peace and Ju ·tice Coalition 
and the Libertarian Party 
joined CARD at noon to "focus 
attention on the fact that our 
govern ment is pushing the 
draft furlher and further," 
according to Rick Jahnko, 
spokesperson for CARD. 

"This is the first timewe\e 
had draft boards ince the 
draft was ended ... in 1973." 
Jahnko said, adding, "We feel 
that people should be aware 
this draft board training is 
going on 0 that they canjudge 
the promises made earlier that 
we would only have regist ra· 
lion ." 

There are now fourteen 
draft boards in an Diego 
Coum v, with five volunteer. 
on each. Chosen last "ummer 
from a pool of volunteers 
solicited from civic groups, 
Chambers of Commerce and 
media relea~es, the seventy 
new board members are 

currentl~' undergoing training 
from the elective en'ice 
administration. 

CARD. with a local 

membership of about 500 
people, ha s a diverse 
population; over half of the 
members are women. many of 
them older, "There's a concern 
among people immediately 
affected, like students and 
young people, but there is also 
concern among the general 
population, those people who 
remember Vietnam," Jahnko 
said. 

Fritz ands. Libertarian 
party candidat e for t he tate 
Assembly, 7 th District, 
joined the rally, stating "We 
(the Libertarian Party) are 
opposed to the draft because 
we're opposed to slavery." He 
went on to ~tate that "The 
draft will probably begin 
during the summer, maybe in 
a cou pie of years, when t here is 
no organized student protest." 
'ands went on to say, ''The 

government will be 'ery 
sneaky about it all, that's why 
rallies and protests are 
nece ·sary. I mean, why have a 
draft board without a draft? 
Why have a draft without a 
war? Look around, we've got a 
lot of opt ions - t he Falkland 
Island!>, EI alvador. the 
Middle Ea!>t. maybe Poland or 
Nicaragua, maybe the 
Caribbean ... pick a war, any 
,." ar, righ t '" 

The picke'ters were more 
hopeful. Dan Rubinstem, of 
the Students tor Peact' at San 
Diego Stale l'niver-.it} said, HI 
thlOk thmg:; like thi~ (protest) 
really do have an effect. 1\ e 
seen-it on campu:-, and I thmk 
the people want peace."

leo Tolstoy was one of the giants of 
nineteenth-<entury world literature, In 
his writings he grappled with some of 
the most tormenting problems of his 
time and ours and showed himself to 
be a psychologist virtually without 
equal. Always demanding of himself. 
he sought to inspire his readers to 
.search for the true meaning of 
existence. This course will deal with 
the major novels and stories he 
produced in h Is long career. 
Discussion will focus on the 
compelling moral and social issues

Maxine Cheever, from CARD, 
agreed, "I think the Peace 
Movement is here in force 
again. People aren ' t going to 
stand for the draft or a war, 
we're not fool any longer." 
One group of independent 
radicals , declaring them 'elves 
"members of the human race" 
told The Guardian that 
Reagan would only be reo 
elected "over our dead bodies. "

Though reminiscent of the

of a more sophisticated 
organlzat ion. Group leaders

to them strictly. The

Satire has a long and rich tradition in Russian literature, In the twentieth 

century, satire has often proved to be one of the few outlets for criticism of 
Soviet society, The sul!ject of this satire have ranged from the government 
bureaucracy, the military, and the literary establishment to the foibles ofthe 
"new" Soviet man, This course will concentrate primarily on the 
development of satire in the 1920's, a period of great eJlperimentation, and In 
recent decades, a time of radical upheavals in Soviet culture, Readings will 
Include works by 6ulgakov. flf and Petrov. Zoshchenko, Volnovich. Sinyavsky, 
Iskander. and Aksyonov,

The result of these unrealistic

ourselves to be something of a

Apocalyptic conference 
"Doomsday" - followed by 

t he second coming of Christ -
is an idea that ha. continued 
through much of Western 
history . 

The earth would tremble. 
the wicked would be destroved 
and a glorious New J rusafem 
would filter down from the 

heaven~. an eternal home for a 
chosen few . 

To shed more light on this 
neglect ed su bject, the William 
Andrews Clark Memorial 
Library at UCLA is presenting 
a pu blic . eries of seminars of 
"Messianism and Millenarian-
ism in English Literature and 
Though t, 1650-1 00." 

eries organi/er Richard 
Popkin explained that 
"millenarianism" i~ the belief 
in t he coming millennium, the 
100-yenr reign of Jesus as 
described in the Bible . 

"Mes~ianism." he added, "is 
the related belief that God's 
messiah (anointed one) would 
soon appear." 

Today. t he word' mille-
narianism and messianism are 
generally unknown. Yet the 
belief in the coming 
millennium has beenoneofthe 
major forces in the We tern 
wor ld for the past four 
hundred years. says Popkin,

interpret the definition of 
"endorsement" from the 
definiton given in the 
'Definitions' chapter of the 
election codes. which reads: 
"Endorsement is when an 
individual or group(s) 
publically s upport a 
candidate(s) in her/ his bid 
for an elected office." 

The Judicial Board cho e 
to uphold the procedural 
definition of "endorse" over 
the 'Definitions' definition 
of endorse. And since the 
'Moonies' did not file the 
proper paperwork. the 
Student Action late was 
guIlty of lIbel in the printing 
of the flyer . 

(In addition to the 
definition i .. ue. the Board 
also considered charges that 
the flyer insinuated Tollner 
attempted to co\'er up the 
endorsemen l.) 

The tudent Action Slate 
stated that "ob\'ious 
ambigU Ities" existed In the 
codes. and that they 

intended the endorsement 
statements to be understood 
in common sense terms. 

"There is no way you can 
expect 9.000 students to 
think that when we used 
·endorsement'. we meant 
they (the 'Moonies') filled 
ou t t he paperwork," 
Stephen I Iaskins told the 
board. 

And , " i n terms of 
malicious intent.there was 
none." Kakishiba told the 
board. "it was simply a 
devise we used as an 
example of Dave's (TolI-
ner 's) politics ... (as being) 
right of center." 

Tollner. meanwhile, 
impressed on the board that 
hi . campaign was irrevers-
ably damaged as a result of 
the f1\'er. 

"As far as I know, the 
'Moonies' ha\'e very few 
followers," Tol\ner said, 
"And It Isn't politically 
favorab le to be assocIated 
wit h them."

Not just a figment of the 
poor and bypassed. mille 
narianism has found de\otees 
among the great scient ists and 
political leaders of times past. 
Sir Isaac Newlon and Joseph 
Priestly were millenarians. 
Oliver Cromwell was another. 
John Milton, too. believed that 
an ideal religious st at e of 
affairs cou ld and would come 
to pass. 

"Various millenarian and 
me. sianic movements have 
influenced modern history." 
Popkin said. "The whole 
Middle East situation, of 
course. ha been affected by 
various millenarian claims. 
The Balfour Declaration of 
1917. favoring the es tablish-
ment of a Jewish national 
home in Palestine, was 
certainly based on it. Lord 
Balfour was a staunch 
millenarian .

speculation about th

"And there are important

Heart x-ray at Medical Center 
A computer t hat "subtract ~ " irrelevant data 

from X-ray pictures of the heart is enabling 
physician at the UCSD Medical Center 
(University Hospital) to obtain clearer, more 
precise images with less risk to pat ients and at 
less cost than the standard method of X·ray 
heart imaging. 

"Digital cardiovascular flu oroscopy" 
involves injecting a radiopaque (opaque to X-
rays) dye into a vein in the arm or leg. Once the 
dye circulates to the heart, still or moving X-
ray pictures are taken. A computer 
"subtract" irrelevant images, i.e., image - of 
tissues that do not contain dye,leaving a sharp 
picture of the dye-containing struct ure of the 
heart only .. 

The computer also can "translate" the 
image into a color picture, enablmg pysicians 
to discern more easily cert ain abnormalities, 
such as ischemia (lack of blood suppl y) or 
Impaired function of the hear t. [n addit ion, the 
computer ailalyzes the data. pro\' iding more 
precise and objective measuremen ts t han a 
human observer could. 

UC D Med Center was among the first in 
the country last year to mtroduce digital 
flu oroscopy for evaluating heart fu nct ion . ehe 
technique is now u 'ed here for t he detection of 
ischemic hea rt dIsease, as well as for the 
evaluation of heart. fu nctIOn. under the 

direction of Chilrles Hlggms, M.D., chi<'f of 
cardiovas uclar radiol ogy. a nd William 
As hburn, M.D., chief of nuclear medicine. 

Only hal f a dcwen cen ters in the cou nt ry use 
the technique for heart imaging. according to 
Dr. Higgins , but its use for imaging blood 
vessels elsewhere in the bod y has become 
widespread, as physiCIans have become aware 
of it. advantages. 

Heart catheterization, the tandard method 
of X-ray heart imaging, involves injecting 
radiopaque dye directly into the heart via an 
artery. Either s til or mov ing black-and -white 
pIctures can be taken during the procedure. 

Since digital computer fluoroscopy requrie 
inject ing the dye only into a vein in t he arm or 
reg, it is considered less risky t han heart 
catheteri zat ion . The patient need not be 
hos pitalized follow ing the procedure, thus 
reducing costs. The new test also can be 
perfor med more q ui c kl y th a n hear t 
cat heteri 7ation, reducing costs. 

T he procedu re wi l not yet replace heart 
rat hetenzat ion, however, because it st ill can 
not be used to examine certain s t ructure~ . , 
such as t he coronary arteries, according to Dr. 
Higgi ns But for many pat ients needing heart 
tests at (lC 0 Med Center. computer digit al 
fluoroscopy will proVIde a ~a fer. less costly

caught wit h it . lzod's off: the USC football team was 
put on two year probat ion by t he NCAA preventing 
it from appearing in bowl games in 1983 and 1984, 
and from being televised in 1982 and 1983. The 
:"-JCAA caught one of the frat's assistant coaches 
selling players' tickets for a profit and returning the 
I ncome to t he players . 

Not t hal serious, you !-.ay, but that is like catching 
a mafioso for tax fraud ; could have nabbed him for 
more but at least you got ·em. 

One week after the CAA handed down their 
decision, those slippery Trojans went on record as 
saying that the probations were too stiff for such a 
minor crime. Two years probation for selling a 
coupl of tickets to help put those "starving

classes that never existed? taning students? 

Frat President James H. Zumberge. in his reply to 
the probation. said " ... that the severity of the 
penalties reflects a measure oh-ind lct Ivene"s that IS 
shocking for an organizatIOn \'o.lth the slatureof the
