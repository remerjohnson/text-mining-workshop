...... Attack ... 
On UCIC Campus 
SANTACRUZ-At 11 p.m. 
on Sept. 17, a woman was 
grabbed from behind while 
walking alone on a UCSC 
campus path. According to 
UCSC police, the woman 
fended off tlie attacker by 
kicking him in the groin. The 
police believe the attacker 
intended to rape the-woman, 
although she escaped with 
only minor bruises. Police said 
the victim started to struggle 
as soon as she was grabbed. 
Her attacker fled into a 
wooded area when she kicked 
him, and has not been seen 
since. There were no actual 
rapes at UCSC during 1994, 
however one attempted rape, 
two cases of sexual assault and 
battery and two cases of other 
sex offenses were reported.

More than 500 UCSD students, 
wearing red armbands and black 
shirts to show their solidarity, gath-
ered in the Price Center plaza on 
Thursday as part of a nationwide 
protest against the end of affirma-
tive-action programs. 

The plaza was transformed into 

"Freedom City" for three hours, a 
forum which featured speakers ad-
dressing civil-rights and affirmative-
action issues. 

The sPeakers included several

Rape Reported 
To Police -
ASSAULT: Victim has not yet 
filed a police report about the 
Oct. 1 North Parking incident 
By Teny&.ew 
AuocJllttI News Editor 

A woman, who wished to remain anony-
mous, called the UCSD police last Tuesday 
morning to report being raped on Oct. 1. 

According to the police department, the 
woman said she had not yet decided whether to 
make a formal police report. 

"We don't know her name, and we don't know 
how it happened," said UCSD Police Detective 
Bob Jones. "All we know is that -it reportedly 
happened on Oct. 1-in the evening hours-and 
we're guessing that it was somewhere in the park-
ing lot area above Marshall College." 

The woman did not dcscribC her attacker or 
the circumstances leading to the assault. 

Jones said that Nancy Wahlig, director of the 
Student Safety Awareness Program, bad been 
speaking confidentially to the roommate of a fe-
male student who reported being assaulted in the 
same area on the same day as the caller, and that the 
two anonymous reports were probably related. 

According to Jones, the UCSD police are 
obligated to inform the university community of 
any sexual assaults occurring on campus by 
noon the following day.

Fiber-Optic Cable Will Soon be Installed in University Centers 
DELAY: 'Reasonable' 
price negotiated with 
outside contractor 
By Mary HI,,_ 
St.ff Writer 

KSDT - UCSD's student-run 
radio station - and several other 
organizations in the University Cen-
ters wiu soon be linked up to UCSD's 
fiber-optics network, administrators 
announced last week. 

The project, which was initiated 
lut October following a fiber-optic 
cable request from Student 

Cableworks, was temporarily de-
layed while UCSD Administrative 
Computing & Telecommunications 
(ACf) negotiated a reasonable in-
stallation price with an off-campus 
contractor. 

Eddy Mardon, manager of the 
project and an administrative ana-
lyst in the telecommunications plan-
ning section, said ACT recently re-
ceived a favorable bid from an 
unidentified contractor, and that the 
long-awaited fiber-optic link be· 
tween the University Centers and 
the Central Utilities Building (CUB) 
will soon become a reality. 

The university has placed an or-
der for the installation of the fiber-
optic cable, which should be in-
stalled within the next three weeks. 

Mardon said that the installation 
itself should be a simple process, 
taking only three days to complete. 

"We don't need to do any dig-
ging," Mardon said. "The tunnel 
system that runs through certain parts 
of campus already exists between 
the Student Centers and the utilities 
(building]. 

"All we need to do now is install 
the interduct between the Student 
Centers and CUB," he added. 

The interduct is an orange, plas-
tic tube approximately 1.25 inches 
in diameter, through which the fi-
ber-optic cable is pulled. 

Contractors estimate that they 
will need 2,000 feet of cable to com-
plete the project. 

As a result of the new fiber-optic 
cable installation, the University 
Centers will be equipped with 24 
new ports, through which campus 
organizations could gain access to 
the Internet.

benefit from the new fiber-optic link

Guardian Reporter 

In an effort to better serve the 
dining needs of UCSO students, 
administrators approved S1.5 mil-
lion in renovations this summer to 
several Revelle dining areas, includ-
ing Anchorview, the Revelle Deli 
and the student-run "Why Not 
Here?" facilities. 

According to project manager 
Mark Oitman, Anchorview is be-
ing remodeled primarily because 
it is an outdated facility, and stu-
dents on campus 
have said they 
would like 
Anchorview's inte-
rior to be reno-
vated. 

better and more agreeable eating 
atmosphere. A dining solution was 
derived, in part, from student in-
terviews. 

After the Plaza Cafe opens its 
doors next April, the Deli will close 
down and will be converted into 
"Why Not Here?," which is sched-
uled to reopen in its new location 
near the beginning of June. "Why 
Not Here?" will stay student run and 
will continue to hire students on a 
volunteer basis. 

In the meantime, "Why Not 
Here?" will remain 
open in its regular 
location, while 
one-third ofthe fa-
cility is trans-
formed into an en-
ergy-efficient dish 
room for the Plaza 
Cafe. 

"One of the main 
goals of this project 
is to offer the best 
service possible,"

also a manager at Ote

Juice Bar to Replace Assorted Vmyl 
VACANCY:UCAB 
fills space after A.S. 
fails to meet deadline 
By IEItIIe! ~oon 
Gun/an Reporter 

On the Juice, a fruil juice and 
smoothie vendor currently located 
in the Price Center Food Court, 
will soon move to the space VI-
cated by Assorted Viny I at the end 
of last year. 

The University Centers Advi-
sory Board (UCAB) and the A.S. 
Council agreed 10 have UCAB take 
over the space and install a new 
business of its choice following 
the council's June decision to shul 
down Ihe student-run Assorted 
Vinyl Co-op. 

"We decided that UCABshould 
take over the space, because On 
the Juice was popular with the stu-
dents and seemed like something 
[Ihey) could benefit from," said 
Jean Lee, A.S. commissioner of 
operalions and services. 

However, A.S. president Naomi 
Falk said Ihat the council never 
intended to give the space back to 
the university. 

"The intent of Ihe council was ... 
to put something in that space," she 
said. "We're always seeking 10 

expand and provide new ICrvic:cs 
that aren't already being provided. 

.. A.S.bICw it. Morespecifally, 
.h~ office of operations and ser-
vices blew it," Falk added. 

UCAB gave Lee and her staff 
until July 10 submila proposal for 
a new student-run co-op to re-
place Assorted Vinyl - a dead-
line Falk says was extended to 
mi.d-August. 

"We had from May to Aug. 7to 
submit to UCAB a viable proposal. 
A proposal was never submitted or 
written, as far as I'm aware," Falk 
said. 

UCAB was unavailable for com· 
ment. 

According 10 Lee, it was "un· 
likely" that any new proposal would 
have passed through the initial legis-
lative stages. Lee said that a proposal 
would not have been voted on, in any 
case, because of the difficulty ingath-
ering councilmembcrs during the 
summer. 

"The deadline was right in the 
middle ofsummer, so even if there 
was a proposal submitled, A.S. 
would have had to call an emer-
gency meeting," she added. 

Lee also said thai the council 
had several ideas for the space, but 
it decided that limiting operations 
was in its best interest. 

. "I think whal it came down 10 
wu that, at thia point in time, we 
had to platen and try not 10 get new 
ventures, .. she said. 

1)Ie council voted on June 7 10 
close Assorted Vinyl, after.suffer-
ing Iosscs of S56,000 in two years. 

"Assorted Vinyl started losing 
money due to tough competition 
from Tower Records and other 
stores," Lee said. "Students weren'l 
shopping there because its prices 
were higher than the larger music 
stores." 

Lee added that closing Assorted 
Vinyl ultimately saved the council 
money, "instead ofletling it run on 
and on." 

She asserted that another space 
could become available for a new 
co-op in the future. 

"There has been talk thai the 
space where the rec room used to 
be may open up for A.S. somelime 
later," Lee said. "However, at Ihis 
point, Ihere aren't any new co-op 
services that the students would 
reall y need." 

But, Falk disagreed with Lee's 
assessment. "With all the struc-
tural changes taking placeon cam-
pus, I don't foresee A. S. getting a 
space like Assorted Vinyl's 
again," she said. "It's really un-
fortunate. " 

There will be a Guardian News Writers' 
meeting every Thursday at 4 p.m. 

ae there, or we'll do to you what we did to the monkey.

our years and $40,000 later, I'm still in 
tJie same position. I came to college pri-
marily because that's what people in my 
demographic group were expected to do. 
I certainly didn't come to learn about any 
particular topic. That is, I - like so many 
other students - had no idea what I 

wanted to study when I graduated from high school. 
So, I went to cOllege to prolong the job hunt, to 
improve my resume and to allow myself the op-
portunity for a beller career than I would have been

It didn' t work. 
After 12 quarters and 

countless hours of reading 
about Yanomamo tribes 
and the sleeping habits of 
12th-century medieval 
cows, I am hardly more 
qualified for a job' now then 
I was then. The bottom line 
is that nowadays, a college 
education - particularly a 
UC education - is not 
practical. The end result is 
not worth the initial invest-
ment. 

Everyone has heard the 
complaints of how UCSD offers little in the way 
of a "practical education" -the kind found al San 
Diego State or specialty schools. Defenders of the 
UC educational philosophy contend that schools 
like UCSD are nol designed to teach pnctical job 
skills; they are supposed to teach life skills: how to 
think, how to reuon and how to sucaed. With these 
talents, lludents will supposedly be ready for ei-

. tber further ecIucatioII or a high-level job wbich will 
train them u they go. 

But this approach is neither practical nor effi-

magine, for a minute, that you

walk into an office building -
which is falling apart due to 
faulty engineering stan-

nosed secretary and are then ushered 
into a poorly lit conference room. 

When your lawyer finally does ar-
rive, he claims that he's unclear about 
the ".exact specifICS" of your riahts, but 
he proceeds to draft a letter to your busi-
ness colleague inyway, littering the 
paper with grammar mistakes. Incred-
ibly, the longest - and most compli-

Just what kind of IlCenIrio is this, 
you might ask? Quite simply, it is a IICIO-

The most obvious reason that a col-
lege degree has value is that it serves 
as a ticket into the job market. Statis-
tics taken over the last decade from the 
U.S: ·Department of Education show 
that getting a college degree not only 
warrants placement in a higher income 

such as doctors and air

then you, too, support 
the value of higher edu-

"I don 'tthink I'm going to read that 
section. I'm pretty sure I can get by 
without it." Most students seek to 
do the least amounl of work neces-
sary, justJo.get by . 

Granted, some students came to 
school to study specific subjects. 
Also, many sludents have specific 
career goals and can choose classes 
which directly prepare them for 
those paths. But the majority doesn't 
fall into that group. Thousands of 
students float through classes just 
to get their degrees, all the while 
thoroughly uninterested in the ma-
terial being taught. Even people 
who know precisely what they want 
to do have to suffer through unnec-
essary general-education require-
ments. What could be more useless 
than a. biology major laboring 
through first-year French or a litera-
ture major falling asleep in calcu-
lus? 

Whether or not the idea is to

to be well rounded. You can't 
force a biology major to appreci-
ate and enjoy a foreign language 
if he has absolutely no interest in 
the subject. 

Still, some argue that education 
is what you get out of it, that it is 
not the university's job to encour-
age students to maximize all avail-
able resources. Sadly, this is true. 
As previously. mentioned, a signifi-
cant portion of students do Ihe least 
amount of work necessary. Most of 
these students are not here to learn, 
They came to college for the same 
reasons I did -to get a degree that 
will hopefully lead to a quality job. 
Because these students are actually 
uninterested in the material itself, 
they will certainly get very little out 
of what they are taught. It would be 
more efficient and practical for 
them to enter the job market di-
rectly. If these people are among the 
most capable students in California, 
they should have no problem work-
ing their way up the professional 
ladder into whatever occupation 
they choose. 

On the other hand, college can 
serve as a handy way to delay Ihe 
inevitable job hunt. If this is his 
purpose, and he doesn 't plan on 

The UCSD Guardian 

Il}Irning anything pertinent or ap-
plicable to real life, then he has 
made the right choice. But for most, 
it's not worth four years and 
$40,000. 

The worst problem, however, is 
that it is still diffICUlt for students to 
get a!lything out of college, whether 
they want to or not. Most of the blame 
falls directly on the educatiori system 
and its structure. Once the university 
convinced itself and its students that 
a UC educalion was not directly job-
oriented, il felt comfortable de-em-
phasizing the specific material it 
leaches. The quarter system offers the 
best example. 

With just 10 weeks to cram in 
all the information for a given 
course, students tend to learn most 
of it the night before the exam -
which means that two days later, 
they will have forgotten it all. For 
students to actually retain any facts, 
the material needs to be reinforced 
over a longer period of time. The 
quarter system provides the best 
proof that college students actually 
learn very little, 

Add to that the entire process of 
lectures and exams. Over the course 
of one quarter, students listen to 
approximately 30 hours of lecture,

via the spolcen word. They also read 
an average of 200-300 pages per 
week. Then they are expected to re-
gurgitate those 2,500 pages of read-
ing and 30 hours of speaking in just 
three hours, via the written word -
which takes significantly longer to 
produce than speaking or reading. 

Tests need to be given over a 
much longer period. They need to 
involve oral examinations as well 
as written and should have no time 
restraints. Naturally, this would 
require a substantial funding in-
crease from the government- but 
only if the government wants its 
students to retain the information 
taught to them. I, for one, can cer-
tainly say I remember very little 
from not only my freshman history 
courses, but from last quarter 's 
courses as well. 

Deficient funding produces still 
other problems preventing students 
from getting out of college what 
they put into it. The government and 
its education budget make it increas-
ingly difficult to get anything out of 
a UC school. Consider this: As a 
U.S. history major, I will graduate 
with my degree, without ever hav-
ing studied the American Revolu-
tion or any American history after 

OPINION 5 

1918. The Great Depression? Never 
heard of it. Korean War? Nope. I 
can do this for two reasons: One, 
the school's U.S. history major does 
not require that I study those time 
periods. lWo,the school has not of-
fered classes on those time periods 
since I' ve been here. Increased 
funding would solve this problem. 

But it's also symptomatic of an-
other problem plaguing the UC sys-
tem: revisionist history by the politi-
cal left which now dominates our 
education system. While I can'tlell 
you anything about four major 
American wars - or an entire cen-
tury, for that malter-I can certainly 
tell you how evil all the slaveholders 
were, and how Andrew Carnegie was 
a vicious capitalist, imposing his 
dreadful economic system on thou-
sands of helpless immigrants. Did I 
really need four years of college to 
tell me that slavery was bad? This is 
about all I remember of what I've 
"learned." 

College definitely provides and 
teaches some good skills, necessary 
for obtaining high-level jobs. But 
it doesn't offer enough practical and 
immediately applicable skills, or 
teach enough useful information to 
justify the enormous investment.

6 OPINION The UCSD Guardian Monday,Octobcr 16, 1995 

EDITORIAL BOARD SENDS CYNICAL MESSAGE 
Editor: 

While iI is true that UCSD, as 
a campus, often breeds cynicism, 
the Guardian recenlly took this 
cynicism to new heights. 

In your editorial printed on the 
morning of the largest statewide 
UC rally in a decade, ('''Freedom 
City' : Better in Theory Than in 
Reality," Oct. t 2, t 995) y~u 
wrote, "Affirmative action is 
gone, and it's not coming back any 
time soon." 

This declaration of affirmative 
action's defeat, at a time when the 
battle has barely begun, is truly as-
tonishing. One can easily imagine 
how the current Guardian edito-
rial staff would have written on 
previous political struggles: 

1963 - The Guardian to Mar-
tin Luther King, Jr. on the eve of 
the March on Washington: "Martin, 
forget it. A rally held at the steps of 
the Uncoln Memorial does nothing 

DEGREE: 
Graduation leads to 
better job.~ 
Continued from ..... 4 
unemployment rate for people with-
out a college degree was a startling 
19.0 percent for men and 18.9 per-
cent for women. That number is 
nearly halved for women with col-
lege degrees, plum~eting to a pal-
try 9.7 percent. The unemployment 
rate also drops for men with de-
grees, to 15 percent. 

Beyond monetary benefits, go-
ing to college also allows students 

more than validate the U.S. 
government's power - and the 
white power structure, as well." . 

1985 - The Guardian to UC 
divestment protesters: "Apartheid 
in South Africa is a fact, and it's 
not going away any time soon." 

1989 - The Guardian to 
Czech dissident Vaclav Havel: 
"The idea of a one-sided rally to 
address concerns regarding free-
dom of expression is flawed for 
several reasons." 

If the Guardian editorial board 
is opposed to affirmative action, 
it should say so, rather than hid-
ing behind the supposed irrevers"-
ibility of the regents' vote to re-
peal it. 

If, on the other hand, the edi-
torial board supports affirmative 
action, it could do worse than to 
endorse the efforts of those who, 
in both word and deed, are send-
ing out a clear message that mov-

to mature. Freshman year, I was a 
bratty, cocky student, more con-
cerned with having a beer than 
studying for classes. I did stupid 
pranks. I drank too much. I ate 
poorly and got sick often. Some 
nights, I would debate my 
unresearched and unformulated 
ideas· with my suitemates late into 
the evening. During my early col-
lege years, I learned more about 
what I stood for and - more im-
portantly - why I stood for it. 

In short, college gave me a wall 
behind which 1 could hide, a safe 
place to interact and play around. If 
I played too hard, I got a slap on the

port from a campus cop. But if I had 
done some of the same things off 
campus, a cold San Diego jail cell 
might have been waiting for me. 
College, then, is also a haven where 
students can learn from their mis-
takes. Some of these mistakes, if 
made in the "real world" and not be-
hind the protective walls of the uni-
versity, would be devastating. 

Still, perhaps the most important 
reason to value a college education 
is that it stimulates students to think 
for themselves. I would not be able 
to write a coherent, well-organized 
paper if it were not for higher edu-

LAPD Lab Guilty of 
Corruption 
Editor: 

Dr. Kary Mullis, who won the 
Nobel prize for developing the 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
test, was amazed at what was being 
passed off as science at the Los 
Angeles Police Department's 
(l.APD) forensic lab during the O.J. 
Simpson trial. Lab personnel were 
drying blood samples on cardboard 
and cutting the cardboard in tbe 
open air of the lab, with evidence 
from various cases scattered on 
tables. The dust from the cuttings 
drifted around that poorly air-con-
ditioned lab for as long as three 
days, contaminating Civery shred of 
evidence on which it settled. 

11 is not surprising, then, that 
Simpson's blood was found on the 
evidence. 11 will also be found on 
all of the other evidence from all the 

cation. In addition, I would be un-
able to read critically, formulate 
strong arguments and understand 
allusions and references in our mod-
ern society, if it were not for my 
college schooling. 

Critics point to today '5 higher 
education as being "too rote" and 
"too theoretical." But who would 
you rather have designing an earth-
quake-proof bridge over Coronado 
Bay: a college student who knows 
every theory behind eanhquake me-
chanics, or an uneducated worker 
with practical experience, who 
probably couldn't write a thought-
ful proposal to build the bridge in 

other cases wbicb were exposed to 
the air of that lab. In fact, tbe blood 
of all the people sampled will be 
found on all the evidence. 

Lab personnel should blind 
themselves to prejudice by compar-
ing unlabeled blood samples with 
uncontaminated evidence. If only 
one match is found, tbey have a 
case. If more are found, they have a 
contamination problem. 

Those concerned with "high-
priced lawyers" getting the guilty 
acquitted should instead worry 
about all of the innocent people in 
jail, who could not afJord the legal 
assistance necessary to challenge 
the government's evidence. 

Forensic labs sbould be 
privatized. Then both the defense 
and tbe prosecution can procure fo-
rensic services from labs competing 
to provide the bighest quality at the 
lowest cost.

the first place? And who would you 
rather have performing a heart trans-
plant on you: a doctor who knows 
every theory behind oigan rejection, 
or an uneducated medical technician 
who learned everything on the job? 

Think about living in a world run 
by Domino's pizza delivery guys, 
and then consider the value of 
higher education. Who, but students 
with four-year degrees, even has the 
background to invent new strategies 
and create new innovations for the 
next century? A college education 
has value because it opens the doors 
to employment, maturity and future 
knowledge.

"It wu gratifying to see that so 
many of our students are concerned 
about mltinlaining the diversity of 
the UCSDcommunity ," said Interim 
Chancellor Marjorie Caserio. "I con-
gratulate the organizers on a peace-
ful rally which I believe provides a 
good opportunity to voice impor-
tant issues." 

As part of the event, UCSD stu-
dents, T As and professors were en-
couraged to wilkoutof theircluses. 

"Most students walked out to 
learn about civil rights, to 1earn about 
inclusion," said Brian Dowd, in-
teri m A.s. vice president external. 

All the speakers at the event 
stressed the need for continued stu-
dent activism to combat the recent 
challenges to affirmative action. 

"If we let [the UC regents' deci-
sion to end affirmative-action pro-
grams within the university] go, then 
we are just as guilty as they are," 
said graduate student Anthony 
Navarrete. 

"1bis is our time to step up," he 
said. "1bis is our civil-rights move-
ment Without it, we will take 10 

steps backward. " 
Greg Akili, of the Equal Oppor-

tunity Coalition, said that racial-
and gender-based discrimination is 
no accident. 

"There has been a methodical, 
purposeful and deliberate action to 
keep people of color and women 
from benefiting from the society to 
which they contribute," he said. 

Seversl participants voiced their 
concerns resulting from the UC re-
gents ' decision to end affirmative-
action programs within the univer-
sity. 

"This is an outcry, a physical and 
emotional reaction to go against 
those who don't choose to listen 
about affirmative action," said 
UCSD junior Maria Figueroa. "We 
are pro-active. We are progressive." 

Speakers were not limited to stu-
dents and community leaders. Peter 
Irons, a UCSD professor of political 
science, said there is a lack of diver-
sity in UCSD's teaching staff. 

"It's not that those with political 
and social values of affirmative action 
are unable to teach," he said. "There is 
not enough diversity to be reflective." 

Irons added that much of the fac-
ulty at UCSD does not realize the 
campus is lacking in diversity. 

"The truth is, many professors 
are not very concerned about these

Tram Nguyen, Women's Re-

to the crowd her own experiences as 

a Vietnamese-American woman, 
emphasizing gender issues which 
she feels are involved in affirmative 
action. 

"I hope that people who say, 'af-
firmative action doesn't afJect me,' 
understand how it does affect them," 

she said. "It is not just about race. It 
is also about gender." 

Nguyen said she hoped that by 
speaking out and telling her story 
her peers would achieve a sense of 
realism, discovering "that this is not

Monday, October 16, 1995 The UCSD Guardian 

to the 

One UCSD staff member's journal of his 
treacherous journey up Mt. MclZinley, Alaska 

Monday, June 5: Anchorage, Alaska 
After meeting fellow climbers at the hotel, we all 

ate together at a nearby restaurant. I expected everyone 
to be quite nervous and apprehensive, but to my sur-
prise, everyone was pretty loose. Our head guide is Bill 
McKenna, who has been down off the mountain for 
only a week, after just climbing the Cassin Ridge. 
Wednesday, June 7: Camp II, 5:00 p.m. 

The weather around Denali was not good enough to 
allow the bush planes to land on Monday, so we stayed 
in Talkeetna that night. The weather had cleared enough 
by early Tuesday, so we tlew in early that morning 
onto the Kahiltna Glacier base camp at 7,200 feel. 
After getting organized and setting up the tents, we 
carried a load up to Camp II at 7,BOO feet. Then, we 
went back down to Camp I and spent the night. The 
next morning, after breakfast, we tore down Camp I 
and moved illo Camp H,and here I am now. It's pretty 
wild, in that it does not get dark up here at all. At the 
darkest part of the night, you can easily read a book in 
your tent without a light. 
Thursday, June 8: Camp II, 11:30 I,m. 

A foot of snow came down last night. After break-
fast, we roped up and started off for Camp III, carrying 
a load of food and fuel to cache. Visibility was about 
100 feet. It was windy, and you couldn't see any 
landmarks. We went about 100 yards and then returned 
back to camp because of navigational problems. 
Saturday, June 10: Camp III, 5:20 p.m. 

We finally hauled all of the Camp II gear to Camp 
III. I am exhausted. I think all of the bike riding I did 
in preparationforthis climb helped mecardiov8SCularly, 
but climbing like this uses slightly different muscles. 
My legs were getting pretty sore. I have a big welt on 
my right shin from the boots. I hope this doesn't 

become a major problem. 
Sunday, June 11: Camp 111,. 9:00 p.m. 

Today, we went up Motorcycle Hill with crampons 
and sleds, and cached about 15 days of food and fuel just 
above Windy Comer at 13,000 feet. When we were going 
around Windy Comer, a section of the route was pretty 
treacherous, The trail that had formed in the ice was only 
the width of one boot, and it was cut into a 35·degreeslope 
of blue ice. The hard part was that the 50-pound sleds 
couldn't fit on the trail, so they dragged below you -
down the slope at a right angle, twisting and tugging at 
your torso. This, while carrying a 4O-pound pack. 

We buried the cache and will hopefully move camp 
to 14,000 feet tomorrow. 

Right below our cache site, McKenna showed us 
where he had found three frozen climbers, who died 
two weeks ago. Apparently, their gear was spread 
around all over the place. 
Tuesday, June 13: Camp IV, 7:20 p.m. 

We established CamplVat 14,300 feet yesterday. The 
weather these past few days was ideal, better than it was 
in La Jolla when I left. It got pretty cold last night, 
however - probably 10 degrees below zero. Despite 
putting on additional layers and using my overbag, I was 
wid all night. The ground was sucking away my body 
heat, despite my two sleeping pads. My Thermarest was 
fully intlated, I was totally hydrated and I had a good 
supper. Fortonight, I have put elllra clothing between my 
pads and will try sleeping on top of my overbag to 
increase insulation from the cold ground. 

Since we have been here, another climber has died, 
for a total of five this season. A group of three Spanish 
climbers tried to camp at 19,000 feet on the West Rib. 
High winds shattered their tent. One of the climbers

hen tackle Rueben 
Davis nailed Dallas 

quarterback Troy 
Aikman for a safety on 

. the Cowboys' first offen-
sive play yesterday, the Charger faithful 
erupted with eardrum-bursting noise. 
Dallas hadn't given up a safety since . 
Cowboy QB Rodney Peete fell into the 
endzone on Dec. 28, 1994. 

But 56 minutes, four turnovers and 
endless amounts of yellow handkerchiefs 
later, the only group who cheered San 
Diego's ugly 23-9 loss was the Dallas 
defense. That's because the men in silver 
and blue were on the receiving end of 
three interceptions, one fumble and one 
hopelessly weak arm. 
. The arm in question, of course, be-

longed to Charger second-string quarter-
back Gale Gilbert. Gilbert rode into 
yesterday's contest sporting a paltry 16.7 
quarterback rating and did little to change 
his image, personally causing all four 
turnovers. In the end, it was a game in 
which usual starter Stan Humphries -
out with a shoulder injury - never looked 
better. 

"It was the same system, but a very 

The San Dieao Cbarpn 
.. . .. 

different quarterback," said Dallas safety 
Brock Marion, who garnered one of the 
three I NT's. "We came out and put a lot of 
pressure on [Gilbert]. He was trying to get 
the ball away and not get sacked." 

But despite some mixed-up routes and 
missed passes, Gilbert did have the Charg-
ers moving the ball early. And when the 
Chargers' offensive line provided the time, 
Gilbert delivered. On San Diego's first 
series, he tossed a 14-yard pass to swing-
back Ronnie Harmon and a 16-yard pass 
to wideout Andre Coleman, pushing the 
Chargers into Dallas territory. 

Gilbert's quick snaps kept the Cow-
boys' defense off guard for awhile, but 
sack leader Charles Haley and tackle 
Russell Maryland soon caught on. With 
San Diego leading 2-0 - and with 6:59 
left in the'quarter - the pocket COllapsed 
due to Haley's pursuit, and Gilbert 
coughed up the ball to Maryland. The 
fumble gave Dallas a first-and-tO from 
the San Diego 48-yard line. 

"Wc knew we had to come up with 
something," Dallas middle linebacker 
Robert Jones said. "[Gilbert] came in with 
confidence, but I think we were able to 
keep that confidence level down ... 

The MOON Is 100M: Darryl Johnston (a.k.a. The 
Moose) rumbles for a big gain late in the third quarter 
of Dallas' 2()'9 victory (above left). 

Int.'-'nce: San Diego cornerback Willie Clark (31) 
roUChs up Cowboys wideout Michael Irvin In one of 
many costly penalties incurred by the Chargers (above 
right). 

The NFL's top-ranked offense took 
full advantage of the Charger turnover, 
marching down the field with a five-play, 
48-yard drive in just over two minutes . 
Two big passes by Aikman to wide re-
ceiver Michael Irvin - for 16 and 25 
yards, respectively - put the Cowboys 
on the four-yard line with 4:40 to go in the 
quarter. 

On second and goal, star running back 
and NFL touchdown leader Emmitt Smith 
wiggled his way over right tackle for the 
score - and a 7-2 Dallas lead. 

"[The game] was frustrating at first, 
but the defense hung in there," Smith said. 
"We got the ball back and made some 
things happen." 

When San Diego got the ball back with 
4:30 on the clock, Gilbert's quick snaps 
turned into quick problems. The Chargers 
shot themselves in the feet, gettingslapped 
with a false start, an illegal crackback 
block and an illegal motion penalty - ail 
during the same series. . 

Still, a nifty 4t-yard grab by Coleman 
(on third and 26) salvaged the San Diego 
drive. It was then upto AFCleading rusher

Wednesay, June 1~: 
Camp IV, 8:30 •• m. 

It's my birthday today. No climb-
ing today because McKenna came by 
and called it off, due to the weather. It 
has been windy during the night, and 
a lot of snow has fallen. I haven't 
popped my head out of the tent yet; 
but there is quite a bit of snow on top 
of it. Probably the avalanche dangeris 
too high on the Head Wall. 

McKenna said that Bill Ross, a 
climber in our group from Bend, 
Oregon, had to be taken to the medi-
cal tent last night, and is now on 
oxygen. He had developed a bad 
headache the first night at 14,000 
feet, and last night was coughing 
with fluid in his lungs. He was not 
able to acclimatize fast enough. He 
will have to be escorted down to 
Kahiltna Base and flown out. What 
a pity. Ross is a neat guy who is in 
superb physical condition. 

It took us seven days to establish 
ourcampat 14,300 feet from Kahiltna 
Base at 7,C'IXJ feet. Seven days is the 
minimum time recommended forsafe 
aa:\i rnatization. Perhaps if we had 
taJcen a slower rate of ascent, Ross 
would have been okay. ' 

list night, I realized I am the 
second-youngest person in the 
group. The youngest is 34. What a 
bunchofol' duffers! Butallofthese 
guys are in extremely good shape. 
Damn their discipline! They are al-
ways so prompt. I have to scramble 
like mad, so as not to be the last one 
ready each time. 

Bec:ause of the large number of 
climbers here during the very short 
climbing season, there are two out-
door potties. Each one is just a ply-
wood throne, perched on top of a 
deep hole someone has dug out in 
the glacier. One is located in the 
center of camp, and it is quite the 
socia! gathering place. While you 
are sitting there doing your busi-
ness, people are walking all around, 
perhaps talking to you while wait-
ing in line. Both potties are oriented 
so they have a breathtaking view of 
Mt. Foraker, Mt. Hunter and the 
surrounding lowlands. It would be 
hard to find a potty with a better 
view anywhere in the world. 

Today, we are confined to our 
tents because of bad weather. The 
options are plentiful and varied, and 
they include reading, sleeping, talk-
ing to your tentmate or just lying 
there. Some climbers have brought 
decks of cards or radios. Cassette tape 
players either freeze or drain batteries 
too fast to make them practical.

Another climber died yesterday, 
this one from Taiwan. Apparently, 
his group of six or seven Taiwanese 
cli mbers left its camp at 17,000 feet 
for the summit yesterday, After re-
turning, they got hit with high winds. 
Most of them were severely frost-

not to go any further. Since Mike,

go through my gear and eliminate 

enough weight at 14,C'IXJ feet. I elimi-
nated some weight, but not nearly 
enough. My pack must have been SO 
pounds. When I arrivedal high camp, 
I was totally spent. There were no 
available tent sites, so we had to cut 
snow blocks and dig one out. We 
made a nice, strong fort. 

Fortunately, Sunday was a bad-
weather day. I did not have enough 
energy, after the previous day's gru-
eling carry, to attempt the summit. I 
slept most of the day. 

On Monday, June 19, the early-
morning weather looked good enough 
for a summit bid, so we got underway 
around 7:00a.m. I felt good enough to 
go for it, but I was still drained from 
the carry to 17,000 feet. 

At Denali Pass, the view down 
the Muldrow Glacier was magnifi-
cent. When we got to the Football 
Field, I saw, for the first time, the 
summit ridge and the long and fairly 
steep face you have to climb to get 

to it at the other end. At the top of 
this face, we stashed ol:r packs, put 
on our parkas and made the traverse 
along the summit ridge. The summit 
ridge is very beautiful, quite narrow 
and drops off abruptly -thousands 
of feet on both sides. 

The weather was almost ideal. 
The wind was moderate, and the 
temperature was around zero de-
grees. We were on top of the lower-
elevation cloud cover, and you could 
see hundreds of miles in all direc-
tions. There is a flat area just below 
the summit, where we stayed for 
about half an hour to take pictures. 
Afterward, we headed back to avoid 
a bottleneck on the ridge, since other 
parties were approaching. 

On Tuesday, we tore down our 
camp at 17,000 feet and descended 
all the way down to Kahiltna Base at 
7,000 feet, picking up our caches of 
food, equipment and garbage along

some of our food and fuel to de-
crease weight. 

On ~ w"y to Kahiltna, at around 
8,C'IXJ feet and with about eight mi les 
to go, I developed a very painful shin 
bang from my boots - this despite 
the extra pldding. extra socks, unlac-

fixed the shin-bang problem, and 
we were able to proceed at the usual 
rate. [ wished I,had thought of this 
sooner. I had two huge welts on both 
shins, as well as a black toenail on 
my big toe. I suppose many climb-
ers on Denali would lov: to have 
such minor injuries after their trip. 

We arrived at Kahiltna Base 
around 11:00 p.m., set up the tents, 
melted snow, ate and went to bed. 

The flight back was incredible, 
looking down over the glaciers and 
crevasses, and the magnitude of the 
rugged,jagged,granitepeaks. look-
ing back, Denali still rose above 
everything. 

In Talkeetna, we checked in at 
the K2 Bunkhouse, and then most of 
us went directly over to the Fairview 
Inn forpitchen of beer beforeshpw-

ering. This is a common ritual. The 
bar became full of climbers, most of 
whom had just gotten off the moun-
tain that day as well, and many still 
wearing their climbing pants and 
boots. The place really got iiI up. 

I left the bar about 4:30 a.m. 
I woke up completely hung over, 

enjoyed my fi,rst shower in quite a 
while and went over to the Roadside 
Inn for my first cooked meal. I had 
two breakfasts. Then, I caughl the 
2:00 shuttle to Anchorage, and was 
able to catch a plane back to San 
Diego. On the plane, there was a 
group of climbers with whom I had 
talked on the summit. 

OurcJimb required only 15 days 
to go from the Kahiltna Base land-
ing strip, up to the summit and back. 
The average is 21 days. We were

fortunate to have had such fine 
weather during our climb. No major 
storms hit Denali during our time 
there. And during the preceding five 
weeks before we got there, the 
weather had been so bad on Denali 
that only eight percent of the climb-
en reached summit. 

It's amusing to be back in civili-
zation, where everything is so easy. 
No more melting snow, zippered

GoreTex, Ibuprofen and gobs of sun-

It's All Jerry ... 
In the wake of the Chargers' 

pitiful 23-9 defeat at the hands 
of the Dallas Cowboys yester-
day, the differences between the 
two teams clearly boil down to 
one thing: the owners. 

(Well, the owners, and the 
fact that the Chargers have a 
weak-armed, Gino Torretta-Iike 
backup OB and ~ivers better 
suited for Fresno State. But, that 
is beside the point) 

There is a difference between 
a championship team like the 
Cowboys, and a team which 
languishes with 6-10 records 
before pulling out a miraCle 
fluke year like last season, and it 
comes from the top. 

Jerry Jones is a great owner. 
Why? Just look 1JOUnd. Every 
other team hates him. And I 
don't mean "hate" in the normal 
sense.. I'm ta1king about a deep-
rooted, "Take one IIlOI'e step 
near me, and 1'(1 feed your face 
to your neck" kind of hale. And 
that means everything. 

Just what has that pansy Alex 
Spanos done to make people 
bate him? Wel~ he's made a lot 
of money, donated to several 
charities and is seen smiling on 
the sidelines like a big boob. 
Jerry Jones? Well, he's made a 
lot of money, swindled the NFL 
with some nifty marketiOg deals 
and signed Deion sanders. 

The Chargers' have made 
first-round selections like 
Stanley Richard and Isaac 
Davis. The Cowboys? Try 
Emmitt and Troy. Under 
Spanos, the Chargers have made 
some big pick-ups, like So 
Orlando and Jim McMahon. 
The Cowboys, on the other 
hand, have grabbed Jay 
Novacek and Charles Haley. 

But, aside from acquiring 
top-notch talent, Jones also 
works a room like Frank Sinatra. 
When I went to the Clwgers 
game yesterday, Jones was 
everywhere. He sbook hands 
with all the writers, and chatted 
with players from both teams. 
Spanos was nowhere to be seen. 

Of course, there are the 
aitics who say owners shouldn't 
be seen or heard. However, 
Jones is doing everything in his 
power to make his lelllf- and 
the NFL - more marketable. 
With the bad press surrounding 
athletes these days, we should 
applaud his efforts. 

So next year, when Dallas 
has garnered yet another ring 
and the Chargers have still more 
boring acquisitions, think about 
the men behind it all. Think 
about the owners.

Tritons Tame LMU Lions 
ROARING: UCSD continued to improve its playoff hopes by tying Division I Loyola Marymount 
By Seen Rehlml 
Associate Sports Editor 

The question is: To tie or not to 
tie? In the case of the UCSD men's 
soccer team, it's actually a good 

thing to battle to a 
draw, especially 
since the team can't 
afford a loss - even 
to a Division I 
school. 

Despite playing 
without solrd de-
fender Jay New-

comer because of a recurrent ham-
string injury, UCSD earned the 
much-needed tie, 1-1, against Divi-
sion I Loyola Marymounton Satur-
day nigbt to keep Triton playoff 
hopes alive. 

Loyola came out strong in the 
first half, pressuring the Triton de-
fense right from the beginning. The 
Tritons, meanwhile, played pa-
tiently, making runs on nu~rous 
occasions to keep the offensive-
minded Lion midfielders on their 
heels. 

Stretched out: Brian Turner (left) and UCSD stayed with Loyola 
Marymount through regulation and two overtimes to earn a tie. 

As it turned out, UCSD was able 
to capitalize on a counterattack run .

By LIN CoIliazier

The UCSD cross country

improvement, as 11 runners 

achieved per-

at Saturday's 
Balboa Classic.

The Tritons were paced by 

senior standout U. Castner, 
who captured fourth-place over-
all with a time of 25:43. Only 
13 seconds behind Castner was 
teammate John Walsh, who 
came across the line in 25:56 to 
grab fifth-place honors. 

Those placements, however, 
were to be expected. The real 
story was the five runners who

their pevious top marks. Gavin 
Klinger finished sixth for 
UCSD at 26:43, Mike Wallace 
took eighth in 27:05 and Steve 
Varnell surged to ninth at 27:11. 

The women's team accumu-

15 teams. 

Leading the way for .UCSD

"Shaniqua" Hurley. Unfortunately 
forShaniqua-and UCSD-goals 
were not easy to come by. 

Hurley was denied by celebrity 
goalie JJ. Castner (of track fame) 
while the men's team was unable to 
put another goal past the Loyola 
netminder in the second half. 

The Lions opened the half by 
pushing its defenders up the field in 
hopes of tying the contest. UCSD's 
freshman netminder Jason Reynoso 
came up big carlyon, including a 
deflection of a point blank shot to 
preserve the slim Triton lead. 

"[Loyola Marymount) was never 
dead, though," Triton Head Coach 
Derek Armstrongsaid. "At 1-0, they 
were not going to just lie down and 
die." 

And sure enough, the Lions tal-
lied the game-tying goal at tbe 79:22 
mark, knotting tbe contest at 1-1. 

After the Triton defense de-
flected a crossing attempt away 
from the traffic in front of the 18-
yard box, Loyola's Pat Choate 
flicked the ball behind the crowd 
of players to an awaiting Barton 
Payne, who blasted a left-footed 
strike - from about 10 yards out 
- past a helpless Reynoso. 

"To be honest, I thought it should 
have been called offside," 
Armstrong said. "The referee was 
fine, but it was the bloody linesman.

Tritons Sheath 
Silve..swords, 21·4 
DOU~I-E DIPPING: UCSD dominated a pair of 
games on Saturday, toppling Chapman,. 17-6, and 
crushing #17 Chaminade (HI), 21-4 
By D .. Sweeney 
Senior Sts" Writer 

The UCSD men's water polo 
team is playing as if possessed. 

Havingstumbled through the first 
halfoftheseason with 
an unsightly 3-9 
record, one would 
have thought that the 
Tritons were in for a 
long season. 

But then they hit'a 
litlle winning streak, 

_';";0;; ... which they extended 
on Saturday at the Canyonview pool. 
UCSD prevailed in not one, bullwo 
games, knocking off Chapman Uni-
versity, 17-6, and Chaminade Uni-
versity, 21-4, to extend their win-
ning streak to four. 

And it is not just the winning 
streak that has been impressive: The 
margins of victory during the span 
have been almost unreal. 

In their last four games, the Tri-
tons haveoutscored theiropponents, 
77-23. 

The streak culminated with Sat-
urday night's victory over the 
Chaminade Silvenwords, who had 
been ranked 17th. 

N bas been the caSe recently, 
the Tritons came out of the blocks 

quickly, posting the first score of 
_the contest. After Steve Hom won 
the opening sprint, tbe team got the 
ball to All-American Mike Nalu, 
who threw a rocket at Chaminade 
goalie Kanalu Koenig. Though par-
tiall y blocked, the toss had enough 
mustard on it to trickle into the cage. 

Barely a minute later, John 
Giulianotti converted a Steve Crass 
pass into a cross-court goal, putting 
the home team up by two. Follow-
ing another Nalu score, Giulianotti 
assisted on goals by Hom and Adam 
Bollenbach-and theopeningquar-
ter closed with UCSD holding a 5-0 
lead. 

It was not until midway through 
the second, after the Tritons had 
garnered three more goals, that the 
Silverswords managed to get the 
ball past goalie Joe Welsh, who had 
been impersonating a brick wall up 
until then. By that time it was too 
late for Chaminade, considering the 
way UCSD was playing. • 

Nalu answered the opposition's 
score almost immediately, with one 
of the most impressive shots of the 
game - a sidearm skip-shot that 
fluhed past a defender and the 
goalie, and somehow found the cage.

UCSD Poaches. Leopards 
SPLIT: The Tritons rebounded from 
a Friday loss to Westmont by topping 
the West's #4, La Verne, in four sets 
By Dan Kraft 
Sports Editor 

Hide and seek. A game played 
by elementary school kids - or a 
form of volleyball strategy? On 

Saturday evening, 
the UCSD women's 
volleyball team 
made an argument 
for the latter during 
its showdown with 
La Verne University 
at RIMAe. 

The Leopards 
came in ranked fourth in the 
NCAA's Western Region, hungry 
for a piece of the second-rated Tri-
tons: And as the match wore on, a 
patlern began to develop: UCSD 
inevitably grabbed the early lead, 
but couldn't hide from the La Verne 
counterattack, making all but one 
of the games a nail-biter. 

The opening set began typically, 
with the Tritons jumping out to 
early advantages of 6-1 and 10-3, 
before ·the Leopards began their 
hunt. The Tritons temporarily held 
off the La Verne comeback, when 
they tallied consecutive points on a 
sweet back-set spike by junior 
Christine Chi and an ace by Micke 
Biesheuvel. That made the score 
12-8 UCSD, forcing La Verne into 
a timeout. 

The Tritons continued to roll 
after the break, as setter Sherine 

Ebadi (49 assists) 
connected on a 
jump-serve ace. An 
error by the leop-
ards then gave 
UCSD the game 
point at 14-8. 

However, it was 
then that the Tritons 
demonstrated their 
recurrent inconsis-
tency caused by an 
ever-changing 
lineup. With outside

Warriors Squeak Past 1litons, 1-0 
TRIPPED: UCSD's previously unbeatable women's soccer team dropped its second straight game to Westmont by a 1-0 score 
a,areaw...... 
Contrlbut1rw Sports Writer 

The UCSD women 's soc:c:er 
team, trying to rebound from the 
loss that ended its record-breaking, 

45-game, regular-
season unbeaten 
streak. added another 
piece of history Fri-
day night. 

Unfortunately for 
the Tritons, it was a 
piece the team would ..l:~Wl:.. ratber nol see in the 

books. For the first time in Head 
CQKh Brian McManus' eight-year 
reign, UCSD has lost two games in 
a row, dropping a 1-0 heartb~er 
to Westmont College. 

During the first half, it looked as 
if the Tritons had put last week's 
controversial loss to Cal State San 
Bernardino behind them. UCSD 
dominated the early play, thanks to 
a fierce midfieJd that kept 
Westmont's offense behind 
the center circle. 

UCSD's offensive at-
tack, on the other hand, was 
alive and well, continually 
pressuring tbe Westmont 
defense. The Trilons took 
advantage of lheir edge in speed to 
have the run oftbe sidelines aU day, 
bul they were unable to convert on 
numerous crossing opportunities. 

The "missed-chances" theme 
was reinforced 13 minutes inlo the 
game, when sophomore Betb 
FrceburghcadcdaTriloncornerkic:k 
into tile net. But the score.was disal-

lowed because of a goalkeeper 0b-
struction call on UCSD's Diana 
Muchowski, despite the fact the ball 
sailed well over Westmont keeper 
Debbie Trujillo's head and landed 
several yards behind ber. 

The rest of the afternoon, tbe 
Trilons were off tbeir game - by 
inc:bcs. An inch or two lower on tbe 
four shots that hit the crossbar or a 
couple more inches inside on lbe 
ones that banged off the posts, and a 
game that sbould have been over by 
halftime, would have been. 

By the second half, Westmont--':' 
always a physical opponent - re-
doubled its efforts by punishing any 
Trilon to get near the ball. This 
resulted in a more even midfield 
play and a sustained Westmont of-
fensive attack. 

At the same time, UCSD began 
losing confJdence in itself, espe-
cially after plays such as E1eJohnson 

Lauren Johnson repeated Ihe 
above scenario, just four minutes 
later. She took the ball 10 the top-
rightanc:rofthe penalty box, where 
the sophomore was confrooted by 
two Wuriol1- Robin Paulson and 
Brenda Stratton. Fating in three di-
rections at OIICIC, the Triton made 
Paulson and Strallon look like 
drunken figure skaters, zipping right 
between the two and launching a 
shot as they stnaggled 10 regain bal-
ance . 

As the game wore on, UCSD 
became more and more tentative on 
both offense and defense, whicbwas 
the major reason for the defeat With 
16:4510 play, WesImont'sJennifer 
Wills took control of the ball just 
outside the UCSD box, sunounded 
by three Tritons. But none of tbe 
Trilons made a move Iowud ber, 
and Wills managed 10 get a sbot off 
tbaI hit Peanon in the hands and 

bounced into the goal. 
"She [Pearson] was 

looking wbere she was 
going 10 play the ball be~ 
fore she caught il ;

solid,. they came back from a five-
point deficit to pull 10 within one, 
12-11, when Chi bombed a nicely 
placed Ebadi back-set. However, 
Westmont closed out Ihe set strong 
and won on a service ace, 15-11. 

Game two was doser still. The 
Tritons led 13-11 before the War-

well, and four points later, Ihe War-

DRAW: UCSD 
ties Div. I Loyola 
c.tInued from ,... 18 
They uid that the linesman did DOl 
show up. but how many games are 
there tonight7Thereshould be other 
referees available. It'. a joke." 

After the tying gOl~ both teams 
seemed content to run out the cloc:k 
and make a charge in the extra 
period. 

With two IS-minute overtime 
halves, each team took its shoaat a 
second goal. It was LoJOla·s tum 
in the first overtime, firing five 
shots toward the Triton goal. It 
took the great play of senior de-
fender Kea Burns to keep the con-
tes' .00. 

Reynoso stayed sharp in the net 
and received defensive help from 
junior Nate Hetherington, senior 
Matt Chilton and juniordefenseman 
Chris Siok. 

UCSD turned the tables on the 
Lions in the second extra period, 
sending midfielders up to pressure 
the Loyola defenders. Lion 
nelminder Chris Walter came out 
of his "pen" on many occasions to 

lnag potential crouea, utilizilll his 
six-foot-four frame. 

"Hc'. a pel 'keeper,· II-. 
said. ·We were hying to pIIII ... 
aut further, and bopefuIly ....... 
reach for one that was .liltld.'" 
of his grasp, 1IIIl we could.at get 
that right balI.. 

FonB ... OM last effort to 
score the wiainl goal with tliree 
miDuta left in the overtime. A 
loose ball was knocked out of the 
box and rolled right to Fong, who 
nailed a right-footed blast toward 
the far post. This time, however, 
Walter denied Fong by getting his 
hand on the ball and deflecting it 
just wide. 

"I settled for the tie with a couple 
of minutes to go," Armstrong said. 
"But in the very end, you have got 
to accept [the tie]. There's nothing 
you can do about it. I don't wantthe 
boys to get beat." 

UCSD visits Claremont on Oct. 
18, playing in. another "must win" 

. situation. 
"Claremont is a huge game for 

us," Fong said. MThere' s a big ri-
valry between us, and they are go-
iog to be hyped for it. It 's going to 
be a game." .

Big gain: Ronnie Harmon provided a much-needed spark for the Chargers' offense, 
scoring the only San Diego touchdown on a 48-yard run. 

BOLTS: Chargers 
overwhelmed by Dallas 
Continued from paee 13 
deep into Dallas territory before the gun 
.sounded for the second quarter to begin. 

The Chargers looked to go ahead, but 
Gilbert looked like a man running out of 
room, as he threw his second interception 
straight into. the arms of Cowboy safety 
Marion on tfie one-yard line. Four and out 
by Dallas gave San Diego the ball back with 
10:S61eft in the half. Gilbert then tossed his 
third INT, and the Cowboys again made the 
Chargers pay. 

"You just can't turn the ball over to a 
team like Dallas and expect to win," Charg-
ers wide receiver Shawn Jefferson said. 

Aikman orchestrated an 8S-yard, pic-
ture-perfect drive, going 6-6 on pass comple-
tions in the process. The drive was capped 
by another one-yard Smith jaunt over his 
favorite blocker, right tackle Erik Williams 
- pUlling Dallas ahead 14·2. 

"[Aikman] throws the ball so quick," 
San Diego linebacker Leslie O'Neal,said. 
"The only way we're going to get there is if 
he holds the ball longer." 

The Chargers' first possession of the 
second half provided the only major high-
light for San Diego, as Harmon slipped 
away from an onrushing Dallas "0" and 
streaked down the right sideline. Distanc-
ing himselffrom the Cowboys' secondary, 

Harmon dashed 48 yards for a touchdown 
and trimmed the Dallas lead to 14-9. 

" Our number-one goal was to stop the 
run," Cowboys linebacker Jones said. "We 
were overpursuing, and they got one big 
play on us." 

Charger hopes were dashed, however, as 
Dallas immediately responded with yet an-
other long drive. With Smith virtually 4I:ar-
rying the team on his shoulders, the Cow-
boys stormed 80 yards in 14 plays and -
most importantly - ate eight solid minutes 
off the clock. A Darryl Johnston rumbling, 
bumbling touchdown put the score at 20-9, 
Dallas. 

Most of the fourt\l quarter was slop ball. 
San Diego was unable to move the ball, 
Gilbert was sacked frequently and the Cow-
boys tacked on one more field goal to put 
the game away, 23-9. 

Near the end, the Chargers had one big 
chance to cut the lead, but the play -. deep 
pass to Jefferson - was called back on a 
penalty, because he had stepped out of 
bounds. 

"Ididn'tknow I had gone out of bounds," 
Jefferson said. "I need to see the replay." 

With the loss, the Chargers dropped to 3-
4 on the season, while the Cowboys im-
proved to 6-1. To break even at .SOO, San 
Diego mast beat a tough Seattle team on the 
road next week. 

"This team has a lot of chanCIer and 
heart," JefferlOn said. "We're Dot going to 
give up. We're not going to stop fighting."
