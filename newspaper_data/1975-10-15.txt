1973-74 academIc year placed 
fi fth in total federal grant and 
contract s awarded to US 
colleges and univer itie_1 the National cience Founaation 
(NSF) ha reported. 

The total , $71.1 million for 
the fiscal year 1974, represent a juml? of $15.9 million over the 
prevlou year . The campus 
ranked 12th in the nation that 
year. 

According to U SD con-
tract and grants officer Harry 
Moore, the 1974-75 level is 
lower, at $66.1 million in 
federal and $6.7 in nonfederal 
award , because of a $11 .8 
million grant in 1973-74 for 

construction at the medical 
school. 

However, Moore told the San 
Diego Union that UCSD should 
retam its po it ion in the 
rank ing, regardless of the 
smaller grant total. 

The 1973-74 total includes 
Department of Defense con-
tracts amoun ti ng to $10 million

Beside the phy ical aspects, Pates spoke of heavy drinking

The petition drive to recall

21, is the third drive initiated by 
Del Mar voters since June in 
what has been a flurry of 
political controversy there. 

Four Dcl Mar re ident ,

a UCSD chemistry profe or. 
The petition charges Weare with 
depnving citizens of the right to 
vote on the Del Mar community 
plan, fiscal irresponsibility, a 
failure to implement an Open 
Space Plan and "ignoring the 
people."

Wri Commends Solar Managment 
Editor: 

I would like to take this opportunity to 
commend the Solar Division of InternatIOnal 
Harvester for its handling of the present 
machinist's strike. It is not often that a company 
stands up to organized labor in the effective way 
that Solar has. 

cessions to the Union. His answer was a 
categorical "no," and he further indicated that 
that as far as Solar is concerned, the Union can 
picket all winter if it so desires. 

I must commend Solar for resisting the 
Union's demands, and for not submitting to 
economic blackmail as so many companies and 
communities have in the recent past. (Examples 
include the firemen versus the city of Berkeley 
and the policemen versus the city of San 
Francisco.) 

Now I will concede that it i usually the right 
of the workers to strike, but by the same token, it 
i the right of management to resist labor's 
demands, if possiblc. In most cases, the 
eco nomic hardships impo ed on ~he company 
neces itate some form of coml'romlse, but Solar 
ha thus far been able to aVOid that. [nded, on 
the 11:00 Channel 10 News last Friday night, a 
spoke man for Solar management indicated that 
Solar'S production i ahead of las t year. In fact, 
production for the first quarter of 1976 is now in 
progress. 

I think that speaks very highly for Solar. They 
have been able to recruit a new work force that 
has produced extremely well under a set of rather 
adverse circumstances. These circumstances 
include having one's tire slashed and l or being 
deluged with threatening phone calls and letters. 
But, of cour e, it is all in the spirit of "collective 
bargaining. " 

My animosity toward the Solar strike has its 
roots not in the economics of the strike, but 
rather in the cheap hoodlum violence employed 
by the Union. I trongly object to the senseless 
bombings and assaults in the name of "social 
and economic justice." I further object to the 
manner in whIch the Machinist'S Union has 
attempted to intimidate those loyal employees 
who continue to work in the face of the strike to 
support their families. By such tactics, the Union 
is usurping the rights of the worker who chooses 
not to support the strike. 

The same Solar spokesman mentioned above 
was asked if the company was preparing to alter 
it s terms of settlement in the direction of con· 

I realize that this letter will be interpreted by 
, orne individuals to mean that I am anti-labor, 
but that is not the case. Rather, I am opposed to 
the utilization of violence and threats in areas 
where reason should predominate .. . as in 
collective bargaining.

Support for Basic Research Urged 

by 
William D. McElroy 

A recent National Science 
Foundation report indicates 
that , in constant dollars, 
support for basic research in 
1975 is expected to decline by 8 
percent from the 1974 level. 
And, according to The 
Chronicle of Higher Education, 
"this is the sharpest percentage 
decline ever recorded by NSF. " 
Other accounts from across the 
country indicate that industry 
and state expenditures for basic 
research, particularly in colleges 
and univers ities, are followlOg 
the same downward trend . 

However, what concerns m e 
most is how the academic 
science community and the 
federal granting agencies react 
in this crucial period . During 
such times of fiscal and political 
stress, a psychology tends to 
develop which courd do untold 
harm to the fundamentals of the 
nation 's basic research ac-
tivities . There is, for example, a 
tendency on the part of granting 
agencies to support only the 
"safe" research, and the 
scientific community more 
often than not capitulates to 
this practice. Part of the 
problem is that as public 
opinion shifts, research that 
seems "relevant," and hence 
safe, changes. For example, a 
few years ago the government 
was eager to support research 
on environmental problems. 
Today, enl ironment is 
relatively "out 'and energy is 
"i n ." Thus Sl) ppo-t tends to 
become erratic The e attitudes, 
combined with , congressional 
pressures, can 'n time erode and 
destroy the qu;dity of American 
science. We li'U,t continue to 
support our s Jperior scientists 
steadfastly; at the same time we 
must urge adm nistralors and 
program direl t s in granting 
agencies to ncourage the 
unconvention< I approach to a 

proble~-.that i I be willing to 
Invest fisk capita . 

One significant mod ification 
of the awarding of research 
fund would' enable young 
scienti sts to be less inhibited and 
more creati ve in their t hinking 
and a pproach to fundamental 
problems. Departmental grant 
could be awarded speci fically to 
upport research by junior 

facult y. In thi way, our young 

Chancellor William D. McElroy 
scientists would have a 3- to 5-
year period to prove themselves 
early in their careers . Upon 
receiving tenure, the scientists 
would then apply for a regular 
grant and would be judged by 
the normal peer review process. 

VVho is equipped to judge 
where a breakthrough i likely 
10 occur--the Congre s or even 
experienced sCience ad -
ministrators? The answer is, of 
course, the scholar who is 
willing to gamble his time and 
career o n followin g his hunches . 
In the process of such effort, he 
wi ll work much longer hour 
and with far more energy and 
enthusiasm than if h e is 
following dictum laid down by 
Washington . 

The central, critical core of 
modern science is the body of 
work known as nondirected, 
basic research. In reality the t 
" health" of a nation's science 
effort is a function of the 
quality of basic research being 
done. It is incumbent on those 
responsible for the nation 's 
well-being to provide adeq uate 
support for re earch of high 
qualit y. In turn, scienti sts carry 
the burden of edu ca ting 
decision-maker a to the 
critical impor1allce of basic 
research. Of co urse there are 
often charges that cientists 
cannot prov ide an exact 
definition of quality. However, 
I believe the important issue is 
not the del JOllion , but Lhe 
recog nition of quality . 
Scienti t are able LO provide 
thi s recognition and have done 
so effecllvely through the peer 
review process. The validity of 
this proces has been demon-
strated by the application of 
basic knowledge for the bet-
terment of our society. 

What i at stake, then, is 
more than just a few research 

grants or contracts; it is the 
nature of American science 
itself. Our bigge t challenge will 
be convincing decision-makers 
at all levels that a budget cut 
here or lack of support there, 
while insignificant Individually" 
add up almost impreceptibly 
over lime. Today's cries for 
across-the-board cuts or more 
applied "relevant" research will 
gtve way to tomorrow's "if only 
we had supported those efforts 
back in the '70's." 

If we are to preserve our 
extraordinarily productive 
re earch operatIOn, especially in 
our universities, we must un-
derstand that the more difficult 
the times become, the more 
critical it is to support our basic 
cientists at a steady, predic-

tab le rate.

Tax Trickery 

The nation has taken all the shocks and excitements it wants. It 
would like to give a big yawn and watch the World Series. In 
normal times Mr. Ford would be just the man for it, relaxed and 
easy. The commonl>lace qualities that Democrats sneer at are just 
right for calmer lime . Democrats charge he will be defeated 
because he is dull. Nonsense! If we could just get America back to 
normalcy, presidential dullness would be extolled: Republican~ 
would sport bumper-stickers, "Stay Bored With Ford!" and win a 
landslide. 

The hitch is, of course, that times aren't normal. The pre ident 
can bombinate all over America denouncing "swollen federal 
bureaucracy" and telling GOP women's groups, "I'm going to free 
American business from the s hackles of government over-
regulation," and most people just say, "So what?" They are 
frustrated and a little frightened over bread·and-butter realities. 

The activist Democratic majorities are throwing bills at the 
relucta nt president and it is showing up in the remarkable veto 
record. There has never been a similar 14 months' period in modern 
hi tory . Just last week Senate and House overrode the veto of the 
$2.75 billion child nutrition law with lopsided majorities (Senate 
79-13; House 297-18) and mo t Repubhcans deserted the White 
House. It' worthwhile to compare thi s with veto records of 
presidents going back to 1929: 
President Years Vetoes Overrides 070 Overridden 
Ford 1.2 39 7 17.9 
Nixon 5.5 43 5 11.6 
Johnson 5 30 0 0 
Kennedy 3 21 0 0 
Eisenhower 8 181 2 l.l 
Truman 8 250 12 4 .8 
Roosevelt 12 635 9 1.4 
Hoover 4 37 3 8.1 

It is an extraordinary and growing confrontation. Mr. Ford is the 
veto president. Nobody can doubt (hat he is sincere in his economy 
drive and one admires his doggedness; furthermore nobody loves 
his opponent, Congress. But the whole economic postulate on 
which he operates goes back to Hoover. The huge deficit that 
alarms him so much is primarily due to the recess ion, lo~ t revenue 
and swelling unemp'loyment insurance but he never seems to grasp 
the fact or doesn t mention it. His crusade doesn't seem to be 
catching on and more and more his speeches sound like an un· 
derdog candidate in the last month of a presidential campaign that 
is actually 13 months away. 

La t week Mr. Ford proposed a tax reduction that he called "the 
biggest s iflgle tax cut In our history" if Congress would cut an 
eqUIvalent amount , $28 billion , dollar for dollar, from ex-
penditures. We mu t make, he sa id, "a fundamental decision about 
our nation' s future" and today we s tand at a "crossroads in our 
history." Generally America stands at a crossroads of history only 
in election week. 

Anyway the figures were incorrect, and the proposal was a 
chimera. t'ongress made $17 billion in antirecess ionary tax cuts last 
March and the President went alon~ with it. dra~~in~ Treasury 
Secretary Simon behind him. The issue in Washington today is 
whether the tax cut will be continued; the President added $11 
billion to the $17 billion already in effect and claimed that he was 
offering $28 billion, which was the "Biggest in history" , he said, 
provided Congress went along with the deal, which of course it 
won ' t. It was disingenuous; it was a trick, a propaganda gimmick. 
The temporary tax cut expires in January so that if it is to be 
continued (as It is virtually certain to be, and Congress will pass it 
anyway if Mr. Ford vetoes) it must be done before January. The 
president doesn't send up his own budget message till the end of 
January presumably telling where he wants to make those $28 
billion cuts, and even an all-Republican Congress couldn't enact 
them in less than a year. The president' s ploy is so clumsy that it is 
embarrass ing; it recalls all those Ford WIN buttons. 

There is some evidence of dissension within the Administration . 
It makes the Democratic leader hip happy but is bad news for the 
country. The surest evidence that Democrats think they smell 
vic tory next year is the number of candidates1 by lates t count about 
a dozen. There is no front -runner yet ana a lot of people are 
thinking maybe it will be a retread , bubbling Hubert Humphrey, 
who is the least disliked alternative to everyone else. 

A number of differences among presIdential cou nsellors have 
urfaced rece ntly: Defense Secretary Schlesinger $Iapped down 

Kissinger's idea of Persh ing missiles for Is rael (capable of carrying 
nuclear warheads); vice president Rockefeller virtually told Simon 
to ge t off the team if he couldn't accept the president's probo ed 
$ 100 billion energy agency (which Rocky invented) ; labor 
Secreta ry Dunlop want s to re cue New York C ity while S lOlOn says 
its default would be "tolerable and temporary." The 
Administration is split on the tax cut, Dunlop for it (how did he 
ever get into this crowd?), the usual Simon-Greenspan bloc against 
and Mr. Ford in doubt: Does his $28 billion ploy mean he' s for it or 
against? See the next episode. 

Mr. Ford's favorite target is Big Government and nobody can 
say he is inconsistent for as congressman he voted against school 
aid, medicare, u.rban r~newal andJ~rice supports for far~er~ . "I st;C 
our people making tlielT own decI Ions rather than abdlcatmg their 
future to the mass ive Big Brother structure," he tells business 
audiences. Reporters note that subsequent quest ions from the floor

ma ive dama~e suits brou~ht

Wilson said that Supervisor 
Dick Brown , who e deci ion to 
change hi s mind on the airport 
questIOn resulted in the county 
changing it s vote, was being 
"generous with San Diego' tax 
money ," 

Wilson aid the San Diego

liab le for any damages resulting 
in failure to move the airport , 
a nd Brown would not have to 
worry about such litigation 
because he didn ' t li ve in any of 
the citie in the port di strict. 

Brown lives in El Cajon, who 
favored retention of the lin-
dbergh site.

that the city or the port district 
had done nothing to alleviate 
the noi e problems at Lind-

dramatically along with the size 
of jet aircraft, there was a 
concern that Lindbergh ' Field 
was both too small to hold the 
traffic and not safe enough to 
handle the larger jets. Jumbo 
jet such as the Boeing 747 and 
the DC- IO Tristar still do not 
service the Lindbergh facility . 

Former San Diego Mayor 
Frank Curran suggested at one 
time to build a floating plat-
form off the P oint Lorna or 
Coronado coast which could 
handle the new jets and large r 
traffic. Sites at Miramar, 
Ca rmel Mesa, and Miramar 
have bee,: considered serio us ly 
a t one tIme or another but 

s!r~ng opposition from local 
clt~ze !1 s and the high co t of 
bUilding a nother airport have 
led to the de mise of such 
possibilities. 

Recent proposals by the 
Orange County Board of 
Supervisors to establish a 
resional tri-county airport with 
RIverside and San Diego 
counties have also failed to 
make any serious headway in 
the con truction of a new 
airport. 

by O. Paullronkwe 
Sometime or another you 

may .have had the experience of 
meetmg someone who on the 
surface looks uninterest ing 
unattractive and maybe wei rd 
until you get to know him 
better. 

.In . the wor.ld of science, 
Clentlsts occaSIOnally run into 

matter that behaves s imilarly. 
One of such structures is the 
element helium . 

At room temperature , it is a 
co lorless, odorless gas that is 
t:vice as heavy as hydrogen, the 
hghtest gas. Chemically, it 
refuses to have anyth ing to do 
with other elements at ordinary 
temperatures. 

You can say it is an "unsocial 
element. " 

H owever, when Helium is 
cooled to low temperatures, 
very close to absolute zero, it 
start di playing interesting and 
intriguing characteristics. For 
example, a half-filled bea ker of 
liquid helium will tend to 
overflow. 

AI 0, so lid helium is the 
softe t known solid. 

These and many more 
remarkable properties of helium 
have been the subject of intense 
researc h by physicists. At a 
recent colloquim here at UC 
San Diego, professor John 
Wheatley, one of the foremost 
researchers in low temperature 
physics, described the recent 
~dvan~es in the study of helium, 
lI1c1udmg the work he and his 
collaborators have done here. ' 

Helium is a "twin element " 
or, in scientific language, it'is 
composed of two isotopes called 
Helium 4 and Helium 3 , 
Helium 4 has two protons a nd 
two neutrons while Heluim 3 i 
made of two protons and a 
!Wutron. 
. Of the two i otopes, Helium 4 
IS the more common one. 
Heluim 3 is rare, being only one 
part in ten million of Helium. 

To give a practical picture, 
!his is equivalent to one penny 
10 every S 1 00,000. 

-- --

- ---

Helium 4 in the neigh-
borhood of absolute zero 
exhib its two remarkable phases call~d Helium I and Helium II .' 
Helium I is a completely normal 
liquid but undergoes a trans· 
itio n at the lamda point (around 
7·2degrees K) to Helium 11. 

Helium II , unlike most 
su bstances, remains a liquid 
under its own vapor pressure all 
the way to absolute zero. A 
pressu re twenty-five times that 
of the atmosphere is required to 
solid ify it at abso lu te zero. 

Al so, unlike Helium I 
Helium II exhibiLS a property 
\\ h!C!l phycisi~ts call super-
fluldily, _As a <,uperfillid Hehum 

I)" ,101111 " ' hl'at ky 
II ha ~ ror practical purposes 
7l:rO vi, cosit y a nd can flow 
rriction le!'l>ly out of it s con-
tainer. 

Also, a superfluid has zero 
entropy . (Entropy is a measure 
of di sorder, so a state with zero 
entropy is perfectly ordered.) 

Another remarkable property 
of Helium II is that as a 
superfluid , it is a far better 
conductor of heat than any 
known solid conductor. For 
example, it is two hundred times 
a better conductor than copper. 
Heat flows through Helium II 
j u t a s fa st as water will flow 
out of a faucet. 

Helium 3, the more rare 
isotope of helium, below a few 

milli-degr~~s Kelvin undergoes 
two tranSitIons called " A" and 
"B", both as liquids, 

Until recently, it was un· 
certain whether Helium 3 was a 
superfluid or not. The first 
pro?f of the superfluidity of 
Hehum 3 was an experiment Dr. 
W~eatley and his collaborators 
uSIng a tec hnique called 
"Fourth Sound." 

By thi s technique, they 
showed that a pressure wave 
could be propagated in Heluim 
3 when it IS enclosed in a porous 
medium .- a phenomenon 
characteristic of superfluids 
only , 

Another low temperature 
group at UCSD under 
professor John Goodkind has 
also done significant research 
on the specifi c heat and 

ma~netic behavior · of solid 
Helium 3. Helium 3 and 
Helium 4 are the two known 
case in nature of uncharged 
quantum fluid s. 

Helium 3 is remarkable in 
tha,t it is the only uncharged 
qUId that, obeys ~ .set of prin. 
elples which phYSICists describe 
a Fermi·Dlrac Stati tics 
(He!iu.m 4 obeys Bo e·Einstein 
statistics,) The behavior of 
Helium 3 is imilar to that of 
electrons !n metals, except that 
electrons 111 a metal behave lik e 
charged Fermi fluids. Th e 
transi tion of Helium 3 to a 
s uperflui~, then is analogous to 
the tran ilIon of the electrons in 
a metal to a superconducting 
state (a superconducting state is 
when a metal conducts elec-
tricity without any resistance). 

Commenting on Helium 3 
re earch and the excitement it 
hold , Professor Wheatley said, 
"A lot of progress has been 
made in the last three years in 
understanding Helium 3, but a 
rich variety of new phenomena 
await both experimental and 
Lheoret ical investigation."

Eat Your Fat 
The recent program "The Gun5 of Autumn" has brought a 
~torm of abuse upon the network that produced it, CB . 

Perhaps the main point of the program was that animals a~e 
raised to overabundance so that they may be hunted . The graphiC 
exposi tion of this was probably at th e rool of most people' s di gu t 
with hunter. 

or course, fine poinls such as needless pain can be argued about 
forever. But anyone who eat meat cannot reall y oppose the baSIC 
idea of hunting. Most of the meat on Amerkan tables today is there 
by the grace of man, not God. 

And vegetarians who are vegetarian ' becau e the thought or 
catin~ a "fellow creature' .. nesh disgu ts them aren't any more 
. upenor morally. They're willing enough to give their pa sive 

a~sent to the slaughter or millions of radish plants and gra nola 
t rce~ . 

What makes the murder of a rabbit any worse than the murder of 
a plant? It mu t be admitted that the sowing and reaping of a wheat 
field ju t doe n't in pire much disgust. 

Alter much thought and a Ix-paCI< of Miller High Life, I:ve 
come upon what I think is the reason people are disgusted With 
hunting. . . . 

The reason is that we lend to anthromorphlze anima ls; I.e., ee 
them in our own image. Now at fim this may not eem such a bi,g 
favor--nor is it. But when wc consider that some of us deny thiS 
ame considerat ion to others of our species, anthromorphy must be 

considered a thing to be reckoned with. 
When we see a deer being shot, wc think of Bambi; when we see a 

rabbit killed, we naturally think of the Easter bunny. When we see 
a potato belllg ruthlessly ripped out of the ground, what do we 
thmk or? Just about anything but potatoe . . 

omehow, we get the idea that animal are cute ju t for our 
benefit. 

It works the other way, too. We speak of a person having the 
character of a lion or being as ~ Iy as a fox . We've come to believe 
the characters which we have conferred upon the animals so much 
that we beE,in characteriLing people with "animal attribute." 

How often do wc comparc our. elves to plant? Whilc you or 1 
may describe Hiram Thomas as a vegetable, we almost never 
compare ourselves to one. 

Have you ever tried 10 discO\ er Ihe t rue character of an onion? 
(Parenthetically, I sec by my note. it is no\ time.to de,!-I ~i Wl. t.he 

term "fa cist in . eCL" Therc scem to be no obvIOUS s lInilantles 
betwccn fasci~ts and in ect.,. A ca c co uld be made that insects are 
like fascists when they devour food crops with ncver a thought of 
how tho e who depend on the crops wi ll farc. On the other hanel , it 
must be conccded that fa rmcr\ really elon't ~pcnd a lot of time 
\\ondcring where the in~ect~ will get their ncxt mea\.) 

(So, whether in~ccts harve~ t a crop or larmer. do it , from the 
POll1t of view of the plant bein g. eatc n, it doesn't make a 10\ of 
diffcren ·C. Thc only difference IS that when a swarm of locuq s 
descends on a crop to devour ii , they do it more efficiently -- and 
seem to have more fun while doi ng it -- than any farmer could hope 
to.) 

orne of u are inconsistent, then. We're all for harvesting plants 
but -- heaven forbid -- let 's not han est any animals. 

We are not even consistent in our love of animals. Many of us 
may be horrified at the thought of killing a moose and at the same 
time delighted at the thought ofaj uicy, thick steak . 

Why do we do thi~? The answer is that moose are generally 
thought of as being independent creat ures, free spirit ~ roaming the 

fores t~ . Who \:Quid kill . uch a beautifui creature? 
Cows, unfortunately for them, aren' t . 0 exciting. They're rather 

stupid and oafi.,h look ing. One ra ther gets the impre,sion that cows 
,ort of like being ~Iaughtcred in Kansas City. H aving one-q uarter 
of it~ bulk in the frcezer \\Qu ld ,ecm to be the hi ghest . ituation to 
which a cow could a,pire. 

As for pigs, well ... they deserve it. TheY'1"e so dirt y. We only eat 
them as a humanitarian se rvice. If we didn't kill them , they'd ju~t 
get dirt i cr and smellier. We arc right to put out of their m i ~ery. 

No, none 01 us are truly hone, t. Some of us are ju >t more honest 
than other, .

LiMandri Quits SBPC Post; 
Cites Moran Case 

'Alice Doesn't 
Day'Set 

by Mkhael Simpson 
.art Wriler 

Marco LiMandri announced 
his resignation flom the Student 
Cooperative tatewide external 
affairs co-coordinatorship he 
held with Irma Munoz at 
Monday night's Coop meeting. 

In that post LiMandri had 
shared UC San Diego's un-
dergraduate representation on 
the U C Student Body 
President' s Council. 

In other action, the Coop 
voted down a proposal 10 bar 
the Triton Times from Coop 
meetings. 

In announcing his resignation 
LiMandri cited three reasons: 
the SBPC's convening of a 
closed ses ion to discuss the 
possible removal of its UC 
Santa Barbara undergraduate 
representative, the impossibility 
of developing "a student class 
consciousne sIt through the 
SBPC and the possibility that he 
was hUrling more than he was 
helping it by remaining on the 
CouncIl. 

liMandri said that he had 
wanted last Friday's meeting of 
the SBPC, held in the Student 
Center, to be open to everyone. 
However, the SBPC, by an 
eight to seven vote, had decided 
on a closed session to consider 
the ouster of UCSB's Neil 
Moran for campaign violations. 
(Sce Triton Times story, Oct. 
II, page one .) 

liMandri felt this event 
crystalized what the SBPC is : a 
"structurally incompetent" 
organization which is "dated" 
and marred by a "distinct 
failure with the st udent s." 

Triton Times 8an 
Later in the meeting Mon-

tgomery Reed, Coop 
Propaganda Committee 
chairperson, proposed that 
Triton Times reporters be 
barred from Coop meetint!s. In 
re ponse Fred Speck menlloned 
his letter in last Friday's Triton 
Times on the Coop Steering 
Committee's compromise with 
that newspaper, and said that a 
document of proof of what 
Irma Munoz called" landering 
of the news" by the Triton 
Time should be compi led 
before action i taken . 

Alec Nedelman mentioned 
that Triton Times reporters, as 

students~ could not be exclu~ed 
from ;:)t udent Cooperative 
meetings. 

The motion was defeated 26-
22, with seven abstentions . 

Mark Bookman, Student 
Center Director, told the Triton 
Times yesterday that any 
organization representing 
students cannot bar students 
from their meetings. 

October 29 has been 
designated a "Alice Doesn't," 
a day on which women across 
the nation are being asked to 
refuse to perform the duties 
they normally do, and to 
participate in alternative ac-
tivities that benefit themselves. 

Sponsored by the National 
Organization for Women 
(NOW), the strike day is billed 
as an organized dtsplay of 
feminist nonsupport ~~ "~he 
system." Women participating 
in "Alice Doesn't" day are 
asked not to work in or out of 
the home, do any retail or 
grocery hopping or anything 
that does not satisfy the needs 
of Alice. 

Strike day activities in ' San 
Diego. County .. will in<;lude 
conscIOusness-raiSing seSSion, 
performances by women 
composers and songwriters, 
birth control clinics, and 
numerous other alternatives . 
NOW suggests that women who 
are unable to leave work to 
attend these activities should 
wear "Alice Doesn't" arm 
bands. 

Sex Clinic Enters Third Year 
~y Barry Bovshuw 

Staff Reporter 

Entering in its third year at UC San Diego, the sex clinic offers 
professional counseling to . tudents and staff with sexual problem. 

Thc program has been set up to give the student a comfortable 
atmo phere in which he can discuss his problems. Hugh Pates, 
head of counseling and psychological serv ices works with Dr . 
Judith Joq~ensen, a psychiatrist, in a group format on Wedne day 
from 3 until 5 pm. Appointment s for individual coun eling from 
Pate are available at other times of the week. 

Among the problems dealt with at the clinic are unfulfilling 
sexual relations, homosexuality, premature ejaculation, and failure 
to ach ieve orgasm. People with problems are encouragcd to have 
their sexual partners prescnt at the counseling sessions. 

The services prOVided are st rictl y confidential. Pates said that 
approximately 72070 of the individuals who come in to discu s their 
problcms develop a ~Iearer understanding of their situation, and 
later c .xpres~ satisfaction. 

The sex clinic is locatcd at the Revc lle provost's office .

Floyd Finally Follows 
'Dark Side of Moon' 

by Timothy MacKenzie 
Staff Writer 

WI H YOU WERE THERE -
PINK FLOYD. Columbia 
Records. 

How is Pink Floyd ever going 
to be able to follow "Dark Side 
Of The Moon?" They pondered 
over that question themselves 
(or over two years. Finally the an~wer has arrived in the form 
of " Wish You Were Here." 

"Wish You Were Here" is 
not as good as "Dark Side Of 

The Moon," to the surprise of 
no one. However, Pink Floyd is 
able to rekindle some of their 
previous magic and channel it 
mto a very creditable album. 

"Wish You Were Here" 
won't come right out and grab 
you. Like all of Pink Floyd's 
mu ic, it has certain subtletjes 
that require more careful 
Ii tening. After listening to it 
several times, it will begin to 
grow on you. 

The vocals are not a 
powerful as on " Dark Side Of 
The Moon," but are quite 
effective on "Have A Cigar" 
and the title cut "Wish You 
Were Here." "Shine On You 
Crazy Diamond" is a lengthy 
instrumental with nine pans, 
taking up over half of the album 
time. There is no mistaking a 
Pink Floyd instrumental. 

It is safe to say that Pink 
Floyd will never again attain the 
creative hei~hts that brought 
out "Dark Side Of The Moon." 
We'll just have to be satisfied 
with works like "Wish You 
Were Here." And that'S not so 
bad.

With the release of "Ely ian 
Encounter," the Baker·Gurvitz 
Army is betlinning to show 
some marked tmprovement over 
previous efforts. Spearheaded 
by ex-Cream drummer Ginger 
Baker and guitarist Adrian 
Gurvitz, the Army is developing 
a more solid relationship with 
each other. 

Continued on Page II 

"Ely ian Encounter" starts 
off beautifully with an upbeat 
number, "People." One of the 
albums finer moment s can be 
found in "The Gambler," a 
very melodic work featuring the 
guitar of Adrian Gurvitz and 
the voice of Snips Parsons. 
"Remember" is the album 's 
high point. Here the Army 
reall y sou nds like a force to 
contend with in rock music. 

The musician hip on 
"Elysian Encounter" is 
definitely first rate . Ginger 
Baker re-emerges as one of the 
finer drummer/ percus ionists in 
rock music. His work i ex-
cellent, but not nearly as 
overpowering as it was in some 
of his post-Cream work. The 
highlight of the album can be 
found in the person of Adrian 
Gurvitz, who is absolutely 
dazzl ing on the guitar. A prime 
example can be heard on "The 
Hust ler," where his lightning 

The Sensational Ale. Harve, Band 
guitar riffs blend beautifully 
with the ba sguitar work of 
brother Paul Gurvitz and the 
drums of Ginger Baker. Snips 
parsons on vocals and Peter 
Le rner on keyboard s also 
contribute orne excellent work.

Water Polo, Under New 
Rules, Wins, 13-6 

By Ron Kato 
Staff Writer 

The Triton water polo team, 
playing its first weekend series 
under the newly established 
NCAA rules, bounced back 13-
6, to defeat Pomona-Pilzer 
Saturday after suffering a 9-6 
loss to the UniverSIty of 
Arizona on Friday. 

The rule modifications, 
' already used by the AAU, 

involving the limiting of 
travelling squad and an 
unlimited foul rule, will effect 
many of the independent 
schools like UC San Diego, who 
are not oriented with the AAU 
style of play. But despite the 
recent enactment, UCSD came 
on strong last Saturday to 
defeat the team from Pomona 
by the score of 13-6. Never-
theless, coach Gary Becker said, 
"We'll have to learn some new 
s trate&ies for upcoming 
games. ' 

At the out set of the contest, 
the Triton's Mike Maguire 
scored in the opening minutes to 
give UCSD an early one point 
advantage. Jerry Pillsbury of 
Pomona-Pitzer then followed 
with his first of three goals to 
close out the first quarter in a I-
I tie. 

When play resumed in the 
evenly matched first half, 

Pomona took a short-lived 2-1 
lead before the game was 
deadlocked again at 3-3. At this 
point, UCSD's Dave Harry 
scored two consecutive goals to 
offset Pomona's stubborn 
comeback efforts, only to have 
Duane Brum's penalty shot 
close Pomona within one point 
once again. But Pomona's 
defense yielded another goal to 
the Tntons, as co-captain 
Dennis Thomas scored to put 
UCSD ahead, 6-4, at the half. 

Holding Pomona-Pitzer 
scoreless, the Tritons outscored 
their opponent's by two goals to 
take an unsurmountable 8-4 
lead in the third quarter. 

Unable to capitalize on 
Pomona's penalty foul early in 
the fourth quarter, UCSD ran 
off four unanswered goals when 
both teams were at full 
strengths. Teammates Harry, 
Thomas, AI O'Hern and Joe 
Miller each contributed with the 
necessary goals to put the game 
well out of reach for Pomona. 
Rick Lantz added the final tally 
for the Tritons and Pomona's 
Duane Brum scored on another 
penalty shot 10 bring the final 
score of the game to 13-6. 

Becker's water polo team 
posting an 8-4 record will now 
travel north to face Cal Poly 
SLO, UC Berkeley (JV), Cal 
State Hayward, San Francisco 
and Santa Clara.

Tension mounts . Sweat rolls . A ball bounces. Action begins. 
Three-man intramural basketball is underway and the fun is ju t 
beginning. .,. . 

According to Lee Johnson, the mt ram~ral .actlvlt y dIrector, 
" This year's three-man basketball program IS tWIce as large as last 
yea r's. We have eight leagues and over fifty team." 

Composed of both tall. and short playcJs, th.e leagues are divided 
according to skIll to prOVIde the most competition. 

Far from being a sexist activity, this year's program is not 
compo ed only of male but a lso of females. A few learn have 
incorporated females into their tcams, a first for Ihree-man 
basketball. 

ot only is three- man baskelball a stage for competition but it is 
also a basis for enjoying li fe and having fun for many athletic 
minded tudent. A lack of funds and space, howevc r, has limited 
the extent of this program and many people's na mes a re subjected 
10 being penciled onto waitin g lis ts. 

" What we need ," sa id Lee Johnson, "is more funds to keep our 
programs running." 

Since the maIO idea of inlra mural s is to have fun and meet 
people, player Jim Lopez, ~ized up the situation and commented, 
" Three man basketba ll is a great way to get back into shape and a 
way to meet people and enga~e in some really active competit ion. 
It' even better when you win. ' 

Do yourself a fa vor. Go see one of the games on Wednesday

Women's 
Soccer Club 
Formed 

By Dave Eisen 
Sports Editor 

Not satisfied with the men's 
soccer club last year, UC San 

senior Suzy Hansen has 
her own group for 

he women's soccer 

"They didn't seem to be 
interested in women's soccer at 
all last year," Hansen said. "I 

Club organizer Suz, Hansen' 
(n Photo: Nathan Meye,.) 
thought that it would be best 
to start our own organization. 
We're interested in producing 
some good women's soccer on 
campus . " 

After recruiting some 
women to join the club, 
Hansen made one of her most 
important moves, by capturing 
former UCSD vansity men's 
soccer coach, IIan Rothmuller\ 
to help teach her players ana 
act as official coach. "lIan's 
really interested in helping the 
women learn the game.!' 

ansen said. ' 

For the first quarter, the 
group will just be trying to 
learn the basics of soccer. 
Then in January, the club will 
join the Peninsu la YMCA 
League of San Diego, to get 
some tou~h competition. "For 
now, we Just want the women 
to get the rules and fun-
damentals down, then later we 
can worry about playi.ng othe r 
teams," Hansen explamed. 

The club practices at 
Matthews field, Monday, 
Wednesday, and Friday from 
5-7 p.m . Hansen says that 
beginners should come out on 
Wednesdays to get their first 
look at soccer. 

Students, faculty, staff a 
frie nds of UCSD are ", .. llrn'm 
to join the club.

Weare Petition • •• 
Conlinued from Pale I 

The petition drive against th.e 
ordinance was started because It 
reflected the policies of the 
soon-to-be-suspended plan. 
The council repealed the or-
dinance, later enactini an in: 
terim ordinance effective until 
the Community Plan is revised. 

The petition for Weare's 
recall came in August. 

Weare characterized that 
movement as "the most bizarre 
campaigning this county h~s 
ever known. The attack .IS 
based on innuendo and the BIg 
Lie." He termed the reasons 
for his recall ridiculous: ."It'. 
hard to find anyone wllh. a 
better record on open space; It'S 
hard to find anyone who votes 
more conservatively on 
financial is ues." 

Responding to the ~har~e. that 
the CIty Council demed Cll1zens 
the right to vote on the. Com-
munity Plan, Weare saId that 
being able to vote. on ~I.even 
aspects of the plan gIves CItizens 
more input to the plan than a 
referendum on the plan . 

"People have mixed feelings 
on orne aspects of the plan. 
Thi will let us know how 
people feel on each part of the 
plan," he stated. 
Not Representithe Government 

Of the four Del Mar residents 
who initiated the petition drive, 
only Helen Drysdale would 
comment specifically on the 
recall movement. Drysdale 
explained that the recall 
movement "stems from the fact 
that the Council denied people 
the right to vote on the general 
Plan' that is not repre entatlve 

, " government. 
Dry dale said the voters 

won' t be heard through the 
November 25 election. "The 
que tions were hauled out of 
context from the plan; and the 

publicity campaigns, when he 
came out in the open and ap-
pealed to the racism ,latent In 
many people, that w~s It. 

You can have Alt . . You ca.n 
take the champion 10 all hI 
glory and tyle .. I'm thro~gh 
trying to def~nd hI'!', and tfymg 
to swallow hIS tactIcs. I WIll no 
longer take to hi poetry. I 
won't listen to every fight, 
expecti ng him to break down 
jlnd 10 e. 

And yet you know, when 
they broke in on the TV w!th the 
announcement that Alt h~d 
TKOd Frazier in the 14th, I till 
felt a chill of e citement down 
my "pine. 

city council will then interpr t 
the results in the way they wanl 
to." . 

Drysdale believes that If th t 
11 points of the plan are pa sed 
it will bring economic disc;stel 
to Del Mar. '7he r~nt . 
property taxes and city servl~e~ 
will go up. Many people, In 
eluding student, won't be abl( 
to afford living in Del Mar.". 

Weare stated that the revlsec 
Community Plan wouldn' , 
bring any radical change to De 
Mar' rather it would bring tht 
plan' up to ~ate 'Yi!h pres~.n t 
City CounCIl pohcles. I 
restricts growth to what we'f< 
now doing in Del Mar," he sal(' 
in reference to the Plan. 

C.ouncilperson Sh~par( 
argues that if the plan IS not 
passed, it will increase th 
availability and cost. of st~d~n 
housing, by preserving. eXlstln! 
structures and allOWing fOI 
density bonuses in Del Mar. 

Citizens are Reacting 
Councilper on. Tom Pear 01 

is the only counCIl member whe 
upports the recall movement. 

He termed the recall ." 
re ponsible moveme~t , saylO/, 
the citizens are reacttng t<? th l 
avo idance of a dlrec 
referendum. 

"The City Council. and th 
city attorney are plaYing le~a 
game. People are now 100kl!1! 
tnto the possibility .that the CI~ . 
Council acted Illegally II 
avoiding the referendum," h 
claimed. 

Both sides maintain that the 
are very concerned about Dc 
Mar' future. As one obserye 
noted, the interesting thlf). 
about the recent controveny 11 
Del Mar is that it i centered 0 1 
a town with the same area a 
Balboa Park, eighty per cent 0 
which is already developed .
