The First Day: Rumors, 
Accusations and Voting 

by Scott SadU 
As oclate News Editor 

"Elections start today." 
"Oh yeah?" 
"Yeah. You gonna vote?" 
"I don't know. Who's running?" 
And for the first time in six years voting polls opened at UCSD for 

students to select individuais they want to fill the slots of the political 
hierarchy chosen in last month's campus-wide referendum. 

The polls were-scheduled to open at 10:00 am on Wednesday. At 10:15 
things were not quite underway. 

"We still need a few things to get started," said Matt O'Brien at the 
Revelle voting booth. " Ballots, ballot bags, procedural sheets." 

"Oh, is that all?" 
Rumors of lawsuits, picketting and potential harassment to block the 

voting were as thick and heavy as the moss at the Ching Dynasty 
Monastery. Had the ballots been stolen? Political outlaws hijacking 
reams of mimeographed paper and headin~ for a hideout? Holding up 
Scripps Aquarium and asking for asylum and a delay of the elections? 

Accusations Levied 
Accusations that would have invalidated the previous referendum had 

been levied against everyone from McElroy and Murphy to Andy 

Commentary 
Schneider and the Communications Board. Had the injunction suc-
ceeded? 

Speculative political reporting makes betting on the horses seem like 
sunrise prediction. There are a lot more variables involved in an elec-
tion. The candidates know the glue factories they face if defeated. 

The trick, then, is to search for clues, signs, emblems of cryptic 
meaning to get the feel of the progressing political events. 

Dave Ernst, assistant to George Murphy, administration-student 
liaison, and all-around organizer and executor of the election, pulled up 
to the Revelle Plaza voting booth. He was driving the same golf cart that 
the Emperor of Japan had nearly driven off the end of Scripps Pier in a 
visit to UCSD a year ago. Ernst brought the special voting equipment. 
Along with the ballots and other paraphenalia he showed me the new 
Violation Code that had been hashed out by election organizers. It said 
everything about voting except who to vote for. 

Are Intercollegiates on the Way Out Here? Everyone I spoke to was concerned about the legitimacy of the voting process. Measures were being taken to make this a blatantly straight election. .

U rumors floating around 

UCSD are correct, the school's 
intercollegiate athletic program 
will not outlive President Carter's 
first term. 

A money crunch, which has 
prompted an increase in 
registration fees beginning in 
September, has broug.ht 
speculation that UCSD's m-
tercollegiate athletic program will 
be totally cut off within three 
years. Sources indicate that the 
cut would indirectly help the in-
tramural sports program. 

"I've heard the rumors-mainly 
last year," George Murphy, Vice-
chancellor and Dean of Student 
Mfairs said last week. 

"It comes down to this: we're at 

a point in which additional cuts 
will hurt departments. We can 
make the cuts across-the-board in 
bits and pieces, or excise par-
ticular problems in their entirety. 
I prefer and the Reg Fee com-
mittee prefers, the latter option. 

"We haye avoided a,ctually 
doing this, but at some point we 
will have to. We must figure out, 
in addition to what brought 
students here, what keeps them 
here." 

Murphy concluded, "At some 
point, the decision will have to be 
made." 

Definite Moves "Soon" 
One source told the Triton Times 

that " you'll see defintite moves 
within three years." The source 
added that some administrators

T ay-Sachs Screen i ng Progra m 
To Begin Operation Monday 

by Ran Anbar 
Assistant Managing Editor 

A model program for the prevention of genetic diseases will begin 
operation at UCSD Monday. In this instance the target disease is Tay-
Sachs, a recessive genetic disorder which develops in infants before 
they are born and begins to attack their nervous system a few months 
after birth. 

Cynthia Sucov, coordinator of the prevention program, sees far-
reaching applications for its design. "The principles established in this 
community-based education, screening and prevention process can 
serve as a prototype for the control of other genetic diseases in the 
near future," she said. 

Tay~achs, on the other hand, seems to predominantly strike Jewish 
children of Eastern European descent, although one out of 200 persons 
in the general population are carriers of the gene. 1. Discovery 

It wasn't unti11969 that Dr. John O'Brien, currently chairman of the 
partment of Neurosciences at the UCSD Medical School discovered 

e cause of the disease (a missing enzyme). Before that nothing could 
done for a family aff~ted with Tay-&lchs. Although a cure or 

erapy has not yet been discovered, it is now possible, due to 
'Brien's discovery, to prevent the disease by identifying "at risk" 
rents (those who are both carriers of the gene) and give genetic 

ounseling. 
This identification can be accomplished by a simple five-minute 

lood test. 
It it is detennined that both parents are carriers of the gene, it 
comes established that statistically one of four births of the parents 

ill be a Tay&chs child. Both parenti must be carriers of the gene in 
rder for a Tay~cha child to be born. 
After an adult carrier detection II made, complete family counaeling 

. ~rranged. If parents are "at riIk," they are presented with various 
tematives to taking the risk of havinl a Tay~chs child. 
In some cases the parents may select artificial insemination from a 
no~arrying male donor. Adoption is another discuased option. 

Another alternative is to test the amniotic Ouid around a young fetus

Advisory Committee on Student

Another source said that "There 
is really no reason to continue the 
(intercollegiate) sports program 
the way it is now. Either it should 
be stepped up, or finally 
eliminated. " 

Others disagreed. Murphy said 
that "We get an enormous

But what about the people staffing the polls? U a person works at the 
polls it can only mean that a) they want someone in particular to win, b ) 
they are working for some organization that supports someone, or c ) 
they have some vested interest in the procedure. Anyone who claims to 
be working in the polls because of UCSD pride and/or a desire to help 
make UCSD a better place for students to learn, should report to 
Psychological ervices for an immediate lobotomy. 

" Why are you working at the poll?" 
Ray Feist, member of the Muir College Council, lackey to Dave

Student government as smooth as possible. We want to insure a straight 
election. "

Archaelogists Find Remnants of 
Past Lives at San Diego Mission 

by Margaret Hewey 
Staff Writer 

Digging up the pasi-it's a 
tedious and time consuming 
process. For over ten years, 
University of San Diego students 
have been doing it with patience 
and perseverance at Mission San 
Diego de Alcala. 

Even while alleged 100,OOO-year-
old discoveries have been recently 
unearthed by a University of 
Calgary archaeologist in nearby 
Mission Valley sites-they dig on. 

The UCSD field program is 
headed by two history professors, 
Dr. Raymond Brandes, head of the 
graduate studies program, and 
Dr. James Moriarity, a prominent 
prehistorian and archaeologist. 
According to Moriarity, it's the 
only program of its type in 
Southern California because it's a 
"continuous part of the 
curricuhun. " 

Classes are taught at the site 
each week, and a small museum 
has been steadily filled with more 
than 40,000 artifacts over the years 
from all the diggings. It was a 
Saturday morning when I went out 
to the Mission. USD was on spring 
vacation, yet there were still a few 
dedicated students sifting and 
picking away at the dirt Wlder the 
hot sun. 

Moriarity and his wife Nonnie 
were also there, taking a brief 
donut break. " Hey Doc, I think 
we've found something," comes a 
voice from the site. Moriarity 
excuses himself and gets up for a 
look. 

The discovery turns out to be a 
bone fragment from an Indian or 
possibly Spanish cooking area. 
Nothing terribly signifIcant. But 
Moriarity tells them to put it in the 
artifact pile, a wooden table with 
bits of stones and bones scattered 
on it. 

"I'm afraid I won't be alive 
when this project is completed," 
says Moriarity, whose voice 
resembles William Holden's. "It'll 
probably take 20 years, but Dr. 
Brandes and I wanted to do 
something more than just develop 
a single curriculum that would 
train archaeologists. We wanted to 
be able to bring the student to a 
greater understanding of our own 
cultural heritage. And this is the 
perfect place for it. 

"Here, both graduate and un-
dergraduate students can handle, 
see, touch, reconstruct and 
discover-it's a valuable ex-
perience, even if some of them 
don't go into archaeology." 

Moriarity explained how the 
particular site was chosen for such 
an extensive project, saying, 
"There is a historical record on 
this site and I knew roughly when 
I began here that there was a 
square quadr ngle . .1 discovered 
what linear measurements were 
used from the city of Bergos 
Varez. And once I found that out, I 
measured off . the areas and sur-
veyed it so I knew I could come 
right down on a wall, the main 
wall of the quadrangle." 

Moriarity noted that the sit was 
" prehistoric as well as hi toric" 

because " the Indians were here 
before the Spanish came." He 
stated that there was one purpose 
for excavating historic sites-
namely to restore or reconstruct 

f~atures at some "distinguished" 
time in the past. 

" But we're still in a mystery 
period here because we don't know 
how much of the Spanish 
remains," said Moriarity. " I don't 
know what the architectural 
ouUines are yet. We're just at the 
roughest, crudest stages." 

Moriarity pointed to a rec-
tangular outline at the lowest level 
of the digging area, and said, "By 
the time the Americans were here, 
all of this was an empty, grassy 
field-so they made this their 
cemetery. They dug right down to 
the Spanish level, with some' of the 
remains found near the original 
floor.I traced the bones through 
records and documents. The Army

Vat Yes on Rec Center 
. Please VOTE YES ON THE RECREATION CENTER proposal. The 

real qUstiOH In this issue is whether or not the proposed Recreation 
Center is n eded. At present the demand for the present facilities is so 
great that many of the existing intramual and recreation programs have 
been cut back. 

For example: 
-The number ot games In Intramural tootball was cut trom seven 

games to five games due to lack of field space. 
-In Coed Innertube Waterpolo some leagues were cut to five teams 

per league, meaning only four games for each team. 
-Floor Hockey was played only one quarter this year instead of twice 

a year as was done in the past. 
-Volleyball was cut from three quarters a year to twice a year. 
-In aU these sports participation was up appreciably this year, forcing 

games to be played at later hours and cutting into already scarce hours 
used for open recreation. 

-Many of the Recreation clubs have been forced to hold their 
meetings elsewhere on campus due to the lack of space in the existing 
facilities. 

Ann Carberry might be right in saying that the proposal has its flaws, 
but then again just about every facility on campus does. Take a look at 
the Student Center, the Mandeville Center and any other new facility on 
campus. 

The real question is whether or not we need new recreation facilities. I 
think it is kind of obvious that we do. And if we don't vote YES on the 
proposed facility we may never get the Recreation Center that is so 
desperately needed.

Trident Fellowship Sets Goals 
For Hunger Awareness Week 

You may wonder what has in-
duced a number of students to hold 
this Hunger Awareness Week. 
This project is being sponsored by 
the Trident Christian Fellowship, 
a group of UCSD students who 
have committed their lives to the 
Lordship 0 f Jesus Christ. We 
believe God's love for all men has 
been manifested in us, and it is 
this love and concern for the 
hungry people of the world which 
causes us to hold this Hunger 
Awareness Week. Our expressed 
purpose for the week consists of 
five goals: 

1) To provide information for a 
global awareness of the hunger 
problem. 

2) to generate a hope in the 
effectiveness of the individual to 
help the problem. 

3) To generate funds during the 
week, and beyond, to meet hunger 
needs. 

4) To provide means for con-
tinuing awareness. 

5) To receive feedback on the 
effectiveness of the effort. 

Please listen to what we have to 
say, and let us know if any 
response is sparked in you. You 
are always welcome at our 
Wednesday night meetings at 7:30 
in the ReveUe Fonnal Lounge.

Rec Campaign is "High-Presssure" 
I would like to point out to aU 

uam students that the Physical 
Education Department is 'con-
ducting a high pressure and illegal 
campaign to convince them to vote 
for an ill-conceived and poorly 
designed .Recreation Center. The 
PE Department has already paid 
for a $100 ad in the Triton Times 
(campaign spending limit is $50) 
and is encouraging the posting of 
unidentified (sponsoring 
organization is required to be 
specified) flyers providing 
misleading information about the 
Center. 

We need additional recreational 
facilities, but we do not need the 
extra va gent and raroOff complex 
proposed by a few aristocratic 
elitists. Modest, utilitarian 
facilities should be built on the 
empty land north of Muir college. 
This would provide playing fi.elds, 
tennis and swimming immediately 
accessible from both Muir and 
Third College, with adequate 
parking already located close by. 

IT students are to pay for the 
recreation Center, then they 
should plan, build, and operate it 
themselves. The Center has 

already been planned (how else, 
could they tell you it will have an 
L-sbaped swimming pool, etc.) 
Once they have your money, the 
plans won't change. "Student 
control" has been advertised, but 
there is nothing about this in the 
ballot question. Nor has anyone 
specified the extent of fonn that 
the student control might take. 
Like as not, we would be stuck 

Commentary 

with another "student" center 
operation run by a director who 
cannot be hired or fired by 
students and paid for by a man-

The Recreation Center, as 
proposed, is going to rip you off.

Is There No Justice? 
I g?t up for work as 'usual that morning, at 5:30, walked to the Revelle 

parking lot, and discovered my motorcycle had been stolen. My so 
called "~avy duty" chain and lock, less one link, which had been 
snapped like butter, was all that remained. 

I had not always kept my motorcycle in the five finger discount 
supennart. About three weeks prior to this day, I had been forced to 
move my cycle from the safety and confines of an Atlantis Hall stair-
well. 
. You see, one of our compassionate UCSD "peace" officers 

discovered a regulation that forced me to leave my parking space, 
after a year and a half of hassle free parking. I had made the rounds 
attempting to get permission from the police, parking services, business 

Enticing Summer Job Opportunities 
office, resident deans, hall managers and others. . 

Each person passed me on to the next. I came up against some great 
rational. Here are some of their more valid points: 

1. ) Fire Hazard-the bike holds half a gallon of gas, and Atlantis is all 
cement. Are Not What They're Cracked Up to Be 

Again this spring the South-
western Co. is starting its annual 
campaign to recruit students for 
summer jobs. Many of you have 
undoubtedly seen posters that 
read something like this: 
"Sununer Job: $900 per month. 
Call 459- for interview." If you 
are curious, as I was two years 
ago, you will call the number and 

a secretary will answer. She will 
give you an appointment for an 
interview, but will give you no 
further information about the job. 

If you attend the interview you 
will attain the following in-
formation: the Southwestern Co. is 
a publishing company that uses 
students to sell books door-to-cioor 

ra.t. 

during the summer. YOu will be 
required to go to Nashville for a 
one week training session and then 
will be assigned a . territory 
somewhere in the East. 

The line of books that I sold was 
a two-volume stud~nt handbook 
that are designed for grammar 
school and high school students. 
The books are good, but it took me 
three weeks and $200 to realize 
that students do not need them to 
get through high school. People 
that have spent several hundred 
dollars on a set of encyclopedias 
are not going to spend $40 on a set 
of books that conlain essentially 
the same information as is con-
tained in their school textbooks. 

The representatives will also tell 
you that the average student 
makes $900 per month above 
expenses. What they don't tell you 
(and this is from an article in the 
Wall Street Journal) is that 25 
percent of the students quit. Since 
I estimate that about one out of 
every four student salesmen are 
returning salesmen (and 
presumably wouldn't quit since 
they have done it before,) that 
means that about one out of every 
three new salesmen quit sometime 
during the summer. 

Since most students are looking 
for summer jobs that offer money 
and not experience, be careful. 
Demand that the company give 
you a few names of UCSD students 
who startcd selling their books but 
that soon quit. Talk to these 
students and find out what bad 
aspccts there are about the job. 
Since the company probably won 't 
give you any names, you may feel 
frce to call me at 453-6887.

2.) Every motorcycle owner at UCSD will think they can park there. 
(After a year and a half I had sole occupancy of this space.) 

When I discovered the bike was gone that morning, my initial reaction 
was shock followed by intense rage. I played the game, followed the 
rules and in thre,e weeks got burned. 

I knew the first thing to do was to file a police report. I wasn't sure 
whether to call the campus police or a real police department, I decided 
on the forme r. For the first time in all my dealings with the campus 
police did I get the time of day. 

I w.as mad and they understood my anger, so they said. It's truly 
amazmg that they understood now. Too bad this capacity for un-
derstanding was not available about three weeks prior to this day. We 
sat down, calmed ourselves and filled out a police report. 

. The p~l1>?se of this article is not to make you laugh (however if you 
did that s flOe), but rather to make a point. We need to be aware of 
what's going on around us. Some Sunday morning, take a walk through 
one of the uam parking lots. 

If you can't find a car with a smashed window and a missing tape deck 
it was a slow Saturday night. There's a tremendous problem with crime 
here and I don't feel that the UCSD police department is doing their job 
worth a damn. When a UCSD cop is looking in stairwells for excuses to 
write ~rking tickets, someone might be losing his tapedeck, motor-
cycle, bicycle and in the case of rape, virginity. . 

Regulati.ons are mean,t to be followed, but this can be pushed too far. 
. To ~lIevlate ~omeone s worries about millions of motorcycles parked 
10 stalrw~lls I m out $500. What about insurance? With today's theft 
problems It would cost as much as the bike to insure it. 

I have very little hope of ever seeing my bike again but it took this 
m~ch to, make me aware. In a recent movie, "Network," Peter Finch 
said YO~ ve got to g~t mad. M>: hope is that it doesn't cost you $500 to get 
mad. I m s~re you ve heard It said that the pen is mightier than the 
sword. If thIS pen were but a sword there are numeroWi castrations I 
would perform.

Defend Abortion .Rights 
1be National Abortion Ri8hta Adioo League (NARAL) baa called for 

a national demoutratian at tbe White HOUle In defense of abortion 
rights on Mother', Day, May'. Local actlonaln San Diego and other 
cities are being planned. , 
Although the majority of AmerIcana sUpport lepJ abortion, lawmakers 
continue to paaa legIalatlon l'eItricttn8 our ~ to choo8e. The anti-
choice people lobby, march and organize In a vicious aUempt to turn 
back the Jan. 1973 Supreme Court declaioo. 

Many women don't realize how far the anti-abortion legislators have 
gone. States such as Louislana and North Dakota provided zero legal 
abortions in 1974. Massachusetts and other states have passed laws 
requiring paren"l consent before a minor can obtain an abortion. Utah 
recently passed a law banning the use of state funds for abortion. A 
study by PlaMed Parenthood in 1976 reported that 29 percent-50 percent 
of all women who wanted a legal abortion can not get one. 

The anti-abortion forces, with powerful backing from the Catholic 
Church hierarchy, continue to lobby for a constitutional amendment 
declaring a fetus a full human being from the moment of conception and 
therefore entitied to protection froiD abortion. This type of amendment 
will make all abortions illegal; women will once again face the butcher-
abortionists' tables where tholUnd of our sisters died before the 
Supreme Court decision . . In addition, the IUD would be outlawed 
because it prevents the implarUtion of an already fertilized egg. 
Perhaps a vaginal search of aU women will be required to make sure we 
are not carrying a 'murder' weapon. 

The fetus-fetisbists are pressuring Congress to call a constitutional 
convention to vote on a fetal amendment. If 34 state legislatures pass 
special resolutions calling for this cOIlvention-a convention that would 
outlaw abortion ... woman's right to chooee will be severely affected. So 
far, five states have passed this resolution: Iodiana, Louisiana, 
Missouri, Nevada and New Jersey. Is California next? Anti-abortion 
lawmakers In this state, including Assemblyman Bob Wilson, are 
pushing for it. 

A serious threat came last fall when Congress passed the Hyde 
Amendment which bans the use of Medicaid funds for abortion. This 
would deny abortion rights to 300,000 women each year. The disastrous 
effects of this amendment on poor, black, and chicana women are 
evident: in Washington D.C., 85 percent of aborjions in this majority-
black city are paid for by Medicaid. Why should these women resort to 
dangerous, illegal abortions just because they are poor or non-white? 

The Hyde Amendment attempl$ to divide women along the lines of 
race and economics; it is a dangerous first step aimed at denying 
abortion rights to one section of women in preparation for a future 
denial to all women. The amendment is now tied up in the courts, but a 
similar law could be attached to other legislation at any time.

Erratum ' 
In Wednesday's "Enter Freely" 

column, we said the Triton Times 
ads for the Recreation Center 
were paid for by the recreation 
department. (This is an error. The 
ads, according to recreation 
department head Lee Johnson, 
were paid for from the physical 
education department's " use fee" 
funds. No student money was used 
to pay for the ads, Johnson said. 

The Triton Times regrets this 
error. 

Whithill's remark may have 
shocked some members of the 
campus community but it came as 
no suprise to those familiar with 
his past performance (before Rick 
became " Richard" that is.) For 
Rick Whitehill has had difficulty 
with tne First Amendment before. 

We remember, Rick, when, upon 
David Saxon's visit to UCSD, 
students gathered to protest UC 
complicity in the murderous, 
torturous arm of the federal 
government, the CIA. We re-
member the banner of protest 
placed on the gym steps (the site 
of Saxon's opprobrious defense of 
the CIA's UC presence) which you 
personally, and in violation of the 
most cherished constitutional 
freedoms, tore down. (See tran-
script of the Univeristy's kangaroo 
proceedings against the anti-CIA 
coalition for Whitehill's ad-
mission.) 

You may qualify you r threats 
against 1r. Lee's person as 
" metaphorical," but this is 
somewhat less than convincing to 
those of us who watched you push, 
shove and trample UCSD stud~nts 
protesting the UC/CIA connection 
on that November day. 

We remember, Rick, we 
remember . .. and you haven't 
changed much at all.

'1 AAAAARRRRRGGGGGHH. 
HHH!!!" 

I voted on the issues I thought 
relevant to the future of my 
existence. 

Fifteen students had voted by 
noon at the Main Gym poll ... while 
on the other side of the Noll all the 
lnformation you could want about 
jobs was belng presented carnival 
style. . 

WOW!!! 
Step right up,lget your job here! 

Just knock the right graduate 
diploma off of the scbolastic shelf. 
Three throws for just $15,000 and 
20 years of your life. Or, for a job 
with security, maximum security, 
there is always the Marines. 

While on Muir along the walk 
nell to P&L Andy Schneider was 
walkiDg along passing out hand-

-bills, saying "vote today, vote 
today ... " 

And Jeff Leifer stood in Revelle 
P1aza givipg out green handbills, 
saying, "Will you come out and 
vote today? That's me," pointing 
to the name on the piece- of 
paper ... 

Legal Electioo8-Plea8e • 
And Monty Reed handed out 

pink handbills as a part of a tea~h­
in about alleged illegalities in this 
election and the March referen-
dum. "If I vote today," Reed said, 
" I'll write in 'legal elections, 
please.' " 

And the Triton Times hit the 
newsstands with . an ed·head 
bla.ring " President : Schneider," 
which forced me to stop and think 
about everything I had written, 
who it was written for, what the 
power of the preSs meant , which 
side I was on, and, and, and ... 

As I;. ~ 11.' .~P.d at3 :00 pm. A 
final check fOWld that first day 
voting totals showed that about 30 
students had voted at Third 
College, 80 at the Main Gym , 120 
at Muir , and 115 at Revelle. I could 
not find the Fourth College Poll so 
I went to the Coffee Hut and ate an 
85c meal that tasted like a 
discarded ballot.

Archeology-
CooUoued from Page 1 

is going to supply headstones for 
these bodies. They will remain 
here, s uperimposed over our 
restoration. " 

Along with many other famolL'l 
archaeologists, Moriarity has long 
been a hWlter of early man in this 
area. The Del Mar, Texas Street 
and Buchanan Canyon are some Ii 
his most famous early man ex· 
cavations. 

Moriarity disputes ar· 
chaeologists who claim to have 
found evidence of early man 
before 25,000 years, saying, "In 
my opinion, the only absolute 
dating method for archaeological 
investigations is radio carbon 14. 
To me, it's the only acceptable and 
proven system c:l dating. 

"Though it has errors, the 
errors are always within reason. 
The other methods that have been 
tried (and some of them olfer 
dates of great antiquity) do not 
correlate nonnally with the radio 
carbon dates taken on the same 
sites." 

Moriarity is skeptical about the 
recent discovery of l00,OOO-year' 
old sites in Mission Valley made 
by Dr. George Reeves of the 
University c:l Calgary. " If he 
really has fOlUld 100,OOO-year~ld 
sites, well God bless him-but I'm 
not going to buy any 100,000 
years ... that's the wildest kind of 
assumption based on what he 
thinks the geology is. This isn't a 
discovery, this is a statement of 
nonfact. 

"Though others think it m ight be 
100,000 years old, no professional 
archaeologist who has worked 
extensively in Southern California, 
to my knowledge, has ever talked 
about the possibility of man being 
here before 40,000 years ago, 
except Dr. George Carter." 

Carter, a former Curator of 
Anthropology at the Museum of 
Man and now professor of 
geography at Texas A&M 

University, headed tne 
simultaneous excavation of the 
Texas Street and Buchanan 
canyon sites in t he 1950's. 

He was severely criticized for 
his claims 01 finding 100,OOO-year-
old artifacts, with Moriarity, who 
himself, worked closely with 
Carter on the excavation, 
believing the sites to be not more 
than 25,000 years old. 

McElroy' s Digglng-A lAugh 
Moriarity laughs when asked 

about the recent excavation at 
Chancellor McElroy's house. He 
saw no reason for the r~igging. 
"I excavated the site in the 1950's, 
after it had been discovered by 
Malcolm Rogers. The Chancellor's 
house was built by William Black 
as his own residence. I knew Mr. 
Black when I was a young ar-
chaeologist struggling here. A 
burial was discovered when the 
excavations for the original house 

Sports Cuts...

amoWlt of mileage out of the 
program, given the low-key 
context that we have put it in." 

An argument used by some is 
that intercollegiates service only 
about one-fourth the nwnber of 
students that intramurals do, 
while costing nearly the same. 

Howard HlUlt, currently UCSD's 
head of Physical Education and 
formerly the athletic director, 
attributes the higher cost to t ravel 
and equipment expenses that are 
unique to intercollegiates. 

Rumors Over Years 
He added, " I've heard the 

rumors over the years, but I think 
that any decision that eliminates 
intercollegiate sports should be 
made by students. Personally, I 
think that the sports program adds 
appreciably to student life." 

La Johnson, the head of UC-
SO's Recreation Department, sees 
no advantage to cutting in-

were being done. 
"The burial was excavated and I 

made a museum coije .. tion . I 
didn't excavate the entire area-
you never excavate an entire area, 
I guess, unless you're uncovering 
a pyram id. The point is, I put in a 
good excavation-it lasted 6 or 7 
weeks a nd we gained a great deal 
of information. I realized that 
there were Indian burials there-it 
just wasn't necessary to dig up the 
whole front yard." 

Moriarity often has his own 
students helping him excavate 
some of his sites. For instance-
both the Texas Street and 
Buchanan Canyon digs were 
assisted by students . He's proud to 
say that many of his graduate 
students at the university have 
made several publications and are 
working on their own projects.

"I've heard it discussed." 

"I firmly believe there's a place

want them cut. There is a need for 
competition for some students 
beyond intramurals. 

While some sources were 
forecasting the end of the 
department, all administrators, 
while speaking on the record, 
indicated that the University is 
committed to intercollegiates.

T".~ in District 

by Steve Gould 
Staff Writer 

From the midwinter quarter to 
the end of May, a small group of 
students comprising the USCD 
track club. work out every af-
ternoon at the old football tield on 
the Matthews Campus. UCSD has a 
track club instead of a team 
because there aren't enough 
athletes to compete in every event. 
Of the events our school does 
compete in, one man, Kevin Levine 
Morning, runs in five (and usually 
wins) the 100 meter dash, long 
jwnp , both relays (400 meters and 
mile) and the grueling 400 meter 
run. 

When he was at Pasadena High 
School, Morning finished sixth in 
the state high school championships 
in the triple jump, leaping 46'5" 
(Willie Banks, now the nation's top 
distance jumper, won the meet.) 
Long Beach State, UC Irvine and 
Occidental all thought enough of 
morning to offer him full track 
scholarships. But he chose UCSD, a 
school1with no athletic scholarships 
at all. 

majoring in urban and rural 
studies, "so I didn't run my fresh-
man year. But I just couldn't keep 
away from track." 

In fact, he planned last year to 
transfer to San Jose State, which 
fields one of the NCAA's best dual 
meet teams, but the idea of red-
shirting one year didn't Ilppeal to 
him. 

Since his decision to stay at 
UCSD, Morning has emerged as a 
one man show at most of the meets 
the school enters. His 400 meter 
time (49.0 in his first year of 
seriously competing in the event.) is 
tops in the NAiA District Three; 
known best for his long jwnping 
ability, Morning has managed a 
seasonal best of only 22'9" because 
of a twisted ankle. Last year, he 
hovered around the 24 foot range. 

Running track for UCSD reaps 
few benefits, and by the end of the 
season, Morning runs alone because 
the other sprinters drop off the club.

" I came to UCSD to study," says 

Morning, now a ~ year old junior 

"Our school has potential for a 
good team, but many don't want to 
come out. They take 12 units and 
complain there's nothing to do 
here," complained Morning, who in 
addition to running track, 
carries 20 units and sings to speak Chinese?

" We played very poorly, not well at all," said UCSD golf 

coach Pat Patrick. 
The poor play to which Patrick referred was UalO's 19th 

place finish in the Southern california Intercollegiate Golf 
Tournament held at Torrey Pines Golf Course last weekend. 
A total of 24 teams competed in the tw~y event. 

Battlirig windy conditions, Oave Warnick shot the low 
score for the Triton team with a two day total of 162. War-
nick was supported by his teanunates Harold Wessman 
(166), Ken Nicoll (169), Tim Sullivan (170) and Ron Krueger 
(170). 

" We lost our nwnber one man, Paul Cassaras, who 
graduated last year, said Patrick. " His lost hurt lIS." 

USC won the tournament with a team score of 595. Scott 
Simpson of USC earned the top individual honor by shooting 
a two round total of 143. ~~~~~~~~~~ 

San Diego State University finished a cloSe second, four ~ . 
shots behind the Trojans. The Aztecs placed two of its ~;';';;;ij'~~ 
members high in the individual standings. Curt Worley 
finished a single stroke back of Simpson for second place 
and Wayne Searle tied for fourth with a score of 143. 

UCSD is 6 and 6 in dual matches with two left to play. 
After the match season ends the Tritons will compete in the 
NAiA championship tournament. Patrick believes that 
USIU will be the team to beat. USIU finished fourth in last 
weekends tournament, but Patrick maintains that UCSD 
still has a "good chance" to do well in the season's final 
competition.

Women Lose to Mesa 
Cage~ Fall in Tourney Game 

by MicbeUe Frost 
Staff Writer 

The women's basketball team 
was defeated by Mesa College 61-
44 in a game played Wednesday at 
Mesa. The match was the first 
game for each team in their post-
season league tournament. The 
Tritons went into the tournament 
witi. a 9-!! season record, finishing 
in a three-way tie for fourth place 
along with Palomar and Mesa. 

The first half of Wednesday's 
game was an aggressive struggle 
for control of the ball. As a result, 
there were numerous turnovers, 
loose balls and personal fouls. 
Gradually. the Mesa team 
developed their style and con-
sistency, a combinaUon the . 
Tritons could not overcome. 

UCSD only tied the score once, 
never leading, due to Mesa's tight 
defense under the basket, a llowing 
very few shots from within the 

key. Nwnerous turnovers resulted 
because of UCSD's ineffecUv 
passing and an over-anxious of· 
fense. Mesa's offense began 
working well as they embarked 
upon a 13 point drive, an im-
pressive mixture of outside 
baskets, layups and inside shots. 

With the half-time score Mesa 
36-UCSD 19, UCSO was still very 
much in the game. Unfortunatley, 
the second half proved to be 
equally disappointing for the 
Triton women. As the final buzzer 
sounded, Mesa had increased their 
lead to a 20 ~int difference. 

High scorers for UCSD were 
Ann Carrington with 11 and Carol 
Gebhardt with Mary Joe Speer, 
Dani Grady and Ann Carrington 
each fouled out. 

Triton coach Judy Malone felt 
everyone on her team :was 
hustling, but Mesa "had better 
control over the ball." She added 
that "Mesa is probably the most 

improved team in the league." 
UCSD plays their second game of 
the tournament at 3:30 on Friday 
at Palomar. 

The second annual San Diego 
Intercollegiate Over The Line 
Classic takes place next weekend, 
Saturday, April 30. It will be an all 
day festival of over the line sof-
tball, sun, sand and fun at 
Mariner's Point in Mission Beach. 
Students from all of San Diego's 
college campuses will be invited to 
take part in what is fast becoming 
a spring happening. 

Over the Line is San Diego's 
contribution to lifetime sports and 
places much more emphasis on 
participation than on softball skill. 
All interested students and part 
time jocks are encouraged to see 
Mike Hipp in the Recreation gym 
office to sign up. The Classie is 
-scheduled to start at 8:00 a.m.

'Rock and Roll ~tQrs: 
ng Lots of Trouble 

In the latest issue of Rolling Stone magazine, Keith Richard says 
that he can't believe that a government ~ould spend two seconds of 
its time worrying about what rock and roll band is coming to in its 
country. He said "the idea is: 'let's grab him' so it just becomes 
political outlaws-there' really isn't any way for anybody in our 
position ?r. !'Iy ~sition to ge t a fair trial, because of the image, or 
the preJu(i1ce ... lt's already against me just because of the 
image ... illegal, they ar~ really out to make rock and roll illegal." 

As for his immediate future, he said "finish this live albwn beat 
this rap, hopefully do some gigs in the states later on this year. 'South 
Americ-a-l'd like to bust that one wide open." Richard said he looks 
at South America and thinks of the potential rock and roll audien-
ces ... it's like British petroleum not going and tapping some huge oil 
field. He said " ther,e are thousands and thousands of record buyers. 
They . should be knocking on Moscow's door, they should be hit-
chlukmg down to South America. You could go to New Delhi or 
Calcutta, there are thousands of street kips there. Africa has got to 
be another place where we could get it together." 

About the future of the Stones, Richard replied " As far as I know it 
is just going to go on because it feels good to go on rigbt now . .'.lf 
someone is unable to be witl) the others for a while then there will 
just be a gap, but it will go on." ' 

Rolling Stone magazine then asked if visa problems are massive 
after the Canadian bust, will the Stones keep touring? Richard said 
" Yeah1 'cause we will keep on trying to get in and eventually we 
will." . 
. Britis~ punk rockers, The Sex Pistols, are again making headlines 
m Brltam. Last winter they uttered obscenities on a live TV show and 
~er~ dropped by EM!. This spring they received 50,000 pounds for 
slgnmg With A&M records and 25,000 pouJlds six days later for 
leaving. 

~ft~r a sig~g ceremony near Buckingham Palace marked by 
drmkIng, belch10g and denunciations of the Queen, the Sex Pistols 
rode to A&M headquarters, and apparently. !JAit so much in the 
limousine that the driver refused to take them home. At the offices, 
th~y reportedly drew swastikas on framed pictures, broke II 
w1Odow and threatened employees. 

Some newspapers even reported accusations that there had been 
attempts. to rape some of the women employee~ at the record com-· 
pany offices. But Sex Pistols Bassist Sid Vicious denied the stories ' ~y~ng h,e "Wouldn't have touched the girls with a barge pole.': 
VICIOUS then went to the bathroom, apparently to wash his feet in the 
toilet, when another employee walked in. Vicious reportedly threw 
him in the toilet.

Metaphysical Artworl~ Exhibited 

by Debbie Scbwartz 
Staff Writer 

objects and space. 
One of the basic metaphysical problems that all 

artists must deal with concerns the manner in which 
objects distinguish themselves from each other and 
(rom the space that surroWlds them. This week's 
exhibit at "The Other Gallery" provides three UCSD 
visual art undergraduates an opportunity to share 
their resolutions to th,is problem. 

Much oriental artwork concerns itself with purity 
of the brushstroke or mark. Wick Alexander shows 
such an interest in mark as a means of establishing 
form in his work. Studies of oriental shapes and. 
teclmiques appear in his cloth paintings, hanging 
sculptures, and wall collage. His paintings are 
similar to those of Boston in that his backgrounds 
are indefinite, but his forms have more stability. 

Paintings and hanging sculptures by Martha 
Boston, Wick Alexander and Michael Grisak 
cultivate distinctly individual visions of 
figure/groWid relationships. 

Michael Grisak works with clear-cut definitions of 
form and space in his approach. The minimalist 
elements in his paintings creat rigid representations 
of objects and the spaces in which they exist. His use 
of ~olid color areas and shadows explicitly separates 
objeCts fr~m one another and clearly distinguishes 
between figure and ground. Grisak's sketches make 
the same distinction through direct use of line. 

Martha Boston's acrylic paintings suggest a 
merger of figure and ground. Her shapes subtly take 
form and are often of indistinguishable nature. The 
spatter technique that typifies her application of 
paint gives an aquatic texture to the surface of her 
paintings. The blending of her fonns into nebulous 
backgrounds implies an underlying unity between 

The exhibit will continue through 5:00 Friday 
evening. 

Legendary Modern Jazz Quartet to 'Perform 
The Modern Jazz Quartet has 

scheduled a single appearance in 
San Diego during its current 
concert tour. The concert is

Symphony. 

Called "the best.\lf the best" by 
the noted jazz writer Leonard 
Feather, The Modern Jazz Quartet 
is literally a legend in its own, 
t.ime. 

Originally the rhythm section of 
Dizzy Gillespie's big liand in the 
1940's, The Modern Jazz Quartet 
has the longest life of any en-
semble in the history of jazz. After 
the Gillespie orchestra disbanded 
in 1951 the quartet emerged as a 
formal entity, making its first 
recording and starting on the road 
to world stardom. In the fonowing 
25 years, the MJQ, as it is known 
to admirers the world over, was to 
make its mark on the international

jazz community. 
In Europe no other American 

ensemble has so consistently filled 
concert halls and elicited such 
moving and enthusiastil! ovations 
as The Modern Jazz Quartet . 

The sound of The Modern Jazz 
Quartet has been characterized by 
Whitney Balliett in The New 
Yorker "The quartet, because of 
its instumentation and its cOPstant 
interweaving, has a tintinnabulous 
texture. It shimmers, it rings and 
hums, it sounds like loose 
change." This sound is the most 
refined in chamber jazz: cool, 
swinging, light but not lightweight. 
It contrasts the skeletal economy 
of John Lewis's piano with the 
ornate embellislunents of Milt 

Jackson's vibraharp, heard 
against the easy but driving 
resilience of Coqnie Kay's drums 
and the beautiful tone of Percy 
Heath's bass, weaving sinuously 
throught the musical fabric. 

The MJQ has played with the 
present personnel since 1955. How 
does a sound endure so long? Since 
the four musicians each pursue 
individual ' careers in addition to 
their mutual exterprise, they are 
constantly bringing new ideas to 
their work together. Thus, they go 
on refining their unique style 
without redefining it, never 
straying from their own direction 
but always growing, elegantly 
classic, utterly contemporary.

" King David" was composed in 

1921 and is considered one of 
Honnegger's most significent 
contributions to the 20th Century 
repertory along with his five 
symphonies. The work was 
commissioned for the reopening of 
a threatre in the Swiss Village of 
Mezieres, which had been closed 
since World War I. Honegger had 
been recommended by Stravinsky 
and the first perfonnance on July 
11 catapulted the 28-year~ld 
composer to international fame. 

Kodciiy's " Hungarian Psahn" 
ranks as one of its composer's 
finest achievements. This work 
was. also commissioned for a

Globe Theatre, He last year won

Academy of Television Arts an'

Alcala excavation, graduate 
student Charles Corillo, is piecing 
together a sarcopQagus. Donated 
by La Jollan Tom Barger, the 
2700-year-old coffin was found 
about ten miles south of the 
Dharan airport in Saudi Arabia. 

"There are only about a dozen of 
these in existence," says Corillo. 
"Unfortunately, the body had been 
robbed from it long ago." With 
that he picked up a corner section 
of the coffin from a mass of 
numbered fragments and pieces

on a table. "It's taken me two 
years just to piece this section 
together. The problem with this is 
that it's very delicate and tends to 
crumble every time I pick it up. I 
may try using the grout used for 
fixing bathroom tile in the future."

Corillo and 2 other students in 

the field program will be helping 
Dr. Moriarity start a ' new early 
man excavation in several weeks. 
Moriarity is enthusiastic about the 
project which will be called the 
Brown Site, located by the Town 
and Country Hotel in Mission 
Valley.

Corillo saw that the site looks

"and hopes that he will be able to
