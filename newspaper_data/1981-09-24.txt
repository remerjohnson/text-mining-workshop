A Different Angle 

A boy's dangerous toys ' 
1 once lived on a tiny pacific island ca lled 

Okinawa. Many soldiers died there during 
World War fl. There are memorials scattered 
all over the island dedicated to the dead and 
their cau ·es. 

We children were too small to care or to 
appreciate our close association with war. We 
went to schools built for the Army children. 
We watched movies in hot tin s helters called 
quon et huts. built by the Marines. We even 
went to church in one. We played in the same 
fields and on the same hilltop ' where 
thousands of men had died year s before. 

My friend Brian and r would do careless 
things in that place of invis ible dangers, like 
exploding huge Chinese firecrackers in every 
s nake hole in our neighborhood. What we did 
not know then was that the snakes we teased 
so unmercifully could take us out with one 
bite, more poisonous than a cobra. and just as 
painful. Even the sky and sea held danger. In 
the winter would come huge horrible typhoons 
that would lay waste to whole villages, and the 
water kept s ilent pocket s of deadl y Man·Of· 
War jellyfi s hes and assorted vicious tentacled 
creatures. 

Then there were the man· made dangers. 
Occasionally old WWII bombs and shells 
would be found in rice paddies and fi elds, and 
'ome would occasionally ex plode, wa ·ting the 

discoverer. 
I was such a discoverer. I found my bomb 

near a wall where we s at everyday waiting for 
the olive drab bus to pick u up to go to the 
olive drab school. It was laying in the tall 
weeds, about as big as a milk bottle, all ru . ted 
and crusty. Brian said that it was just an old 
muffler or something, but we both hoped that 
it was something exciting and dangerous, and 
what fit the bill better than a bomb left over 
from some long ago bat tIe? 

I decided to set it off. There I was, six years 
old. walking to a nearby cliff with a mort ar 
s hell resting in my chu bby little hands. I was 
loosely su rrounded by a gaggle of neighbors 
not want ing to see a little boy blown into little 
bit s. 1 reached the cliff and tried to throw it 
over the fence. It went over the fence, but 
rested on a little ledge. I then proceeded to try 
to pus h it off. I t was about then w hen a strong 
hand tore me away fr:~m my tas k. The hand 

~longed to one of. t he members of the Army 
bomb squad, who then took my toy away. 

So it goes, the Army nearl y killed me and 
then sa\'ed me. They say that they want to 
draft me now, so I guess t hey want to kill me 
again . Perhaps one day, when I am in bat tie 
and a mortar shell is about to land in my 
fox hole, a s trong hand will reach in and pull 
me away. Then again, perhaps not.

Melvyl's contribution to UCSD literature 
This Argus had a hun-

dredth eyes ... 
-Golding's trans. of Ovid 

Argus, a ' t he Greeks tell it. 
wa the hundr ed·eyed 
shepherd set to wat ch over 
Jove's mis tress 10. I wa: 
reminded of him when 1 firs t 
'aw the massive array of video 
di s play terminal s in t he 
Undergraduate Library. The 
age of heroes is long past, ours 
i a mock· heroic age: so this 
new Argus is named Melvyl, 
and he guards nothing more 
loft y than records of certain 
volumes in t he University of 
California libraries. 

I spent an idle hour this 
summer learning to talk to 
Melvyl in his native language, 
"Command." (The beauty of 
Command i ' that it lets you 
tell Melvyl what to do; with 
Lookup, his second language. 
you are on the receiving end of 
a programmed multiple·choice 
test.) What I learned i!) that 

like most of hi s digital 
brethren young Melvyl is an 
idiot savant. You have heard of 
people who can recite the 
Con s titution backwards 
without blinking, but cannot 
remember their own names; 
Melvyl is Qne of tho ·e. 

For Melvyllacks all sense of 
proportion . He is not 
interested so much in telling 
you what you want to know as 
in showing off what he knows. 
Suppose you are curious about 
the su bheadings under the 
general rubric '· Iiterature." 
You type the command. 
"Browse Su literature." 
Mel vy l is obliging. "Su 
literature ; 7993 s ubject 
headings found," he tells you 
- and proceeds to Ii °t them all . 
"I. Aardvarks - literature. 2. 
Abaci - literature.. ... You 
have just hit the jackpot, and 
the only way to stop t he payoff 
is to punch the "break" button 
and plead with Melvyl to 
c hange the subject. 

Now , a card catalog has this 
advantage. that you can open 
it where you want , flip 
through it at random, and by a 
mysterious osmotic process 
acquire a general sense of its 
contents in moments. Mel vyl 
is not one for mysterious 
processes or random brow· 
sing rt is all one to him 
whet her he dis plays t en Ii ne . 
or ten thou ·and. 

As you may suppose, Mel vyl 
is rather humorless. I once 
tned to get him to stop one of 
his interminable lists with the 
typed suggest ion to "cram it. " 
"You may not begin a 
command with CRAM, " 
Melvyl replied . This is his 
sl andard answer to most 
anyt h ing he does not 
understand. 

The worst of it is, Melvyl is 
illi terate. I sorely suspect that 
he has not read a single one of 
those books he is so eager to 
tell you about. Item : I asked 
Melvyl to find "TheHistorieof 

Foure· footed Beas tes," an 
early 17t h·cent ury zoological 
treat ise by one Edward 
Tapsell. "Search resu lt: 0 
records at UC librari es," 
Melbyl assured me. I was 
ske pti ca l, s ince mo s t 
uni veristy libraries own a 
recently published facs imile 
edition. So I asked Melvy l to 
look for books by Tapsell. This 
time. without so much as an 
apology for his abysmal 
s tupidity, Melvyl admitted 
t hat he had found " The 
Historie of Fovre·footed 
Beaste s . " Thrown by 
Renaissance v for u! That is 
not merely a bug in the 
program: it is a plague of 
locusts. 

Melvyl is not much fun now, 
but reliable sources hint that 
he is being programmed for a 
few games. Not chess or Star 
Wars, but educational 
bibliographic games des igned 
by prof s~or s of Ii brary 
science. The most interest ing 

is one call " Bookworm 
Invas ion." Melvyl print · a list 
of fifteen books. Then 
computer·generated "book· 
worms" come from the sides of 
the screen and begin attacking 
the books by eating the letters 
of the titles . Players have 
thirty seconds to save as many 
books as possible by typing out 
their tit les. Point s are awarded 
not only for speed but for 
c ritica l judgement : one is 
penalized heavily for saving 
Miss Piggy 's Guide 1o Life 
lOstead of, say, a first edition 
of Paradise Losi. (Indeed, for 
saving it at a ll.) 

Do you suppose Melvyl 
knows what happened to his 
grand fat her Argus in the end? 
Mercury was sent to rescue 10. 
so he sidled up to her guardian 
and began tell ing him a shaggy 
dog s tory abou t how Pan was 
once fool in~ arou nd wit h some 
nymph who turned into a reed'.

Glen and Shearer 

Tuition tax credits: playing with fire 
Back in the third grade, 

there were only two things 
worth doing at recess: playing 
tag and plotting how to blow 
up the school. 

Nothing ever came of the 
latter game, of course, but we 
can st ill recall the grand 
explosions planned and 
executed in our imaginations. 
Leveling our classroom 
building seemed like an 
admirable project at the age of 
eight. 

Now, however, a number of 
older though not·much·wiser 
boys here have an idea that 
might have an equally 
devastating resu It. Several 
U.S. Senators want to give 
tuition tax credits of up to $500 
a year to parent: of private 
school children . 

With support from the 
Reagan admini · trati o n , 

enat e sponsors plan to use 
tuition tax credi ts a ' a plus 
during campaigns next year. A 
bipartisan counteroffensive 
begin ' thi s week when 
s keptics in the House hold 
h ear ing ' to drum up 

oppos ition to I he Senate bill. 
Their arguments will be worth 
listening to. 

The notion of tuition credits 
h as been arou nd for a 
generation or so: Parents with 
kids in private schools often 
think they deserve income tax 
breaks for s houldering both 
property taxes and tuition bill . 
Senate legislation was first 
introduced three years ago. 

While some parents may 
think it's time for tuition tax 
credits, the measure is s ure to 
undermine public ecucation. 
To begin with, the measure 
would basically rob from the 
poor and give to the rich. 

The Senate plan, being 
pus hed by Senators Robert 
Packwood (R·OR) and Daniel 
P. Moy nihan (D·NY), would 
also act as an incentive for 
parent s to move their kids 
from publi c schools and s hip 
them off to privateor parochial 
academies. The accompanying 
tax credits would amount to a 
fed eral s ub ' idy for those 
schoob, many of which don't 
need help. After all, pri\'ate 

schools aren't s ick: they're 
opening at the rate of three per 
day. 

Given l oday's general 
economic hardshi ps, it's hard 
to feel sorr y for parents who 
can afford the luxury of 
private schools for th eir 
children. But the Senate bill 
would also undermine the 
educational system on which 
90 percent of the nation's 
school ·age children s till rely . If 
enacted today, it would drain 
the U.S. Treasury of up to $7 
billion by the end of 1983, by 
which time the admini s tration 
plans to have cutback federal 
education s upport by 25 
percent. 

"If the gcwernment dumps 
policies and parents jump 
s hip, it spell ' deep trou ble for 
th e country," Arnold Fege of 
the National Parent -Teacher 
Association told ou r reporter. 
Mi c ha e l Duf fv . "Pub l ic 
schools will becollle t he haven 
for the least·attractive 
hild ren: the underachie\'er~, 

the disabled . thc poor and the 
problem kid!:> t hat private 

sc hools can imply ignore or 
expell as t hey see fi l. .. 

Tuition tax cred its might 
amount to a knockout punch 
for the already bruised public 
sc hools. If c r e dit s are 
approved, increasing numbers 
of parents could even tuall y cut 
their tax losses further by 
rejecting school tax lev ies at 
the ballot box . Before long, 
good loca l schools wou ld be 
beyond t heir in terest. 

What would our Founding 
Fathers say about tuition tax 
credits? Since 80 percenlof the 
nation's private schools are 
c hurch·af filia ted, federal 
in centives \ ... ould probably 
violate t heir not IOn of a 
separate church and state. If 
churches aren't to be taxed, 
they shou ldn 't benefit from 
tax mea~ ures. Even DeJ.>uty 
Treasury Secretary R. TIm 
McNamar recently admitted 
that there' · no POlOt in 
pursuing federal tax credits 
wit hout judicial re\·ie\.\. <Four 
of five state tuition tax credit 
laws passed in the iast se\'eral 
year~ have been ruled 

unconstitutional) . 
Of course, it's unfair to rail 

against tuition tax credits 
without noting that the public 
schools face enormous 
difficulties. It 's w rong to' 
blame parents for patronizing 
private schools when so many 
have grown frustrated with 
teacher quality. disci plinary 
problems and the many years 
of declining test scores. 

Bu t running away from 
public schools won't improve 
them. Only hard work wi ll. 
There 's hope in t he recent 
rising test scores in Atlanta, 
New York , Trenton and 
Wa ·hington . D.C. It shows 
that public schools aren't a 
lost cause. They deserve all 
the unflinching support that 
parents a;, well as a st mgy 
federal g()\'c rnment can 
muster.

Violent reaction to Iran repression 
.;:ontinued (rom pal!e 2 
of being spi neless b~' hi s 
militar y advisers. and 
according to some accounts, by 
hi s own twin sister, Princess 
As hraf. She reportedl y 
en I{aged' fllin In a loud and 
bitter a rgument over the need 
fo r quick and violent action to 
que ll the ri sing tide of revolt. 
Some of the shah 's generals 
are sa id to hav e cooll y 
discussed the best way to kill 
the million people or more they 
felt would have to be sacrificed 
before the IXlpula t ion cou Id be 
s tunned into submiss ion . 

The shah lapsed into a 
course of half·way measures 
which both enraged and 
emboldened those in rebellion 
against him. The young men 
dying in the streets on ly gave 
courage to at hers st ill fight ing. 
As the deadly toll - shocking 
in it s own right - grew tenfold 
in t he retelling, the resi stance ' 
became even more daring. 

Indeed . it s members ~eemed 
blessed: saved someho .... ,: from 
the mas!;acre they had come to 
expect on hearing exaggerated 
accounts of mass death 
elsew here. 

Now the Religious ciences 
Circle of the hol y cit y of Qum, 
agroupof hard ·line clerb'Y. has 
iss ued a declaration that 
might have been authored by 
th e wors t of th e shah's 
generals , cal ling o n the 
government to increase its 
intelligence efforts and disarm 
everyone except "re I ia ble 
religious individuals." 

They also praised t he efforts 
of chief prosecutor General 
Rabba ni Amlas hi , who seems 
ready at this point to orer the 
mass execut ion of some 4.000 
imprisoned "d issidents." 

The mu llahs dearly are 
scared to death, and are 
beginning to break under the 
pressure. Dozens of them have 
been assassinated by urban 

guerri lias in recent w('('ks: 
most of the survivors Ira\'('1 
about Te heran surrounded by 
bud yguards. The mere s ight of 
the mulla h 's turba n a nd cl oak 
has begun to serve as a license 
to shoo t. 

The second sign of fi s;,ure is 
a profound tac tical s h ift. 
Minis ter for Ex cuti ve Affairs 
Behzad abavi has directl y 
blamed the bombing of the 
prim e mini s tr y on the 
" Monafeqin ." This term can 
be tran s lated as "hypocrites," 
but it is, in fact,a politica l code 
name for the Muhahideen e· 
Khaq, the le fti st orga ni za tion 
headed by Massoud Rajavi, 
now serving as prime minis ter 
in exile under the shoadow

Earthquake safety of USB questioned 

By DEBBIE HARDIN 
The Undergraduate Science 

Building on Revelle Campus 
could sustain major damage in 
the event of a strong 
earthquake, a report prepared 
by an independent engineering 
consulting firm says. 

The report, issued last week 
by J.J. Degenkolb and 
Associates, rates USB's 
earthquake safety as "very 
poor . " The engineers 
predi cted that there would be 
"extensive structural and 
n o n struct ur al damage ,

and ' or falling hazards" if a

Campus Architect Chuck 
Powers believes that this was 
a cursory examination, and 
that the results are being 
blown out of proportion. 
According to Powers, the USB 
was designed in the late 1960s 
and met all of the design 
qualifications at that time. 
Since t hen more stringent 
codes have been put into effect ,

Bekken's charges dropped 
Remember Jon Bekken? 
Bekken, an ASUCSD 

presidential candidate and a 
leader of the campus's left 
wing, acquired two sets of 
criminal charges last year. 

The first and most ·-",,,1 
controversial charge was for 
the publication of ATT credit 
card telephone codes in an 
April 3 edition of the New 
Indicator, a paper on which 
Bekken worked last year. 

Ot hl'r c l,rlrge were for 
battery , t respass'lOg, and 
failure to disperse, incurred 
during the May 29 sit·in of 
Chancellor I<ichard Atkin· 
son's office. 

During a hearing on Aug. 31, 
the City Attorney dropped the 

phone code charges. Bekken, 
in return, pleaded guilty to 
trespassing and failure to 
disperse under the People vs. 
West act, which allows a 
defendant to plead guilty 
without admitting guilt. 
Bekken was fined $150 and 
given a year's probation. 

As part of the plea bargain, 
Bekken was asked tosubmit to 
the NI a letter of retraction , 
which in part read: "The 
publishing of these codes was 
and is against California law, 
whether or not they could have 
been used effectively to 
defraud the telephone 
company. The New Indicator 
used poor judgement in 
publish ing these codes." 

Bekken's attorney in the 
case was Ted Burner, a 
member of the National 
Lawyers Guild, 

"The New Indicator 
published what purported to 
be the credit card num bers, " 
Burner told The Guardian. 
"To my knowledge, they were 
not (actual credit card 
numbers). However, the law 
makes it an offense for anyone 
to pu blish any num ber or code 
of an existing, cancelled, 
revoked , expired, or non· 
existant (nature}." 

According to Burner, the 
codes printed in the NI were 
useless since they were non· 
existent.

KSDT's Fate Postponed Once Again 
AS Council Appoints Special Task Force 

By Ll A ULLIVAN 
Associate ews Editor 

The decision on whether 10 
fund campus radio station 

,KSDT will not be made by the 
Associated Students Council 
for at least another week. 

Rather than making a 
decision at last night' s A 
meeting, council memb rs 
established a task force to 
re 'earch the issue and present 
a progress repon to the cou ncil 
next w k, 

At is ue i' whether to 
allocate $10,000 of the A 
budget to KSDT despite their 
inabilit y to broadcast on 
campus, And A President 
Jule ' Bagneris has repeatedly 
said that he favors t he funding 
only if they broadcast on 
campus, 

But K DT officials . ay they 
can't broadcast on campus 
unless they receive money for 
both an FCC license and the 
equipment neces ' ary for 
campus wide transmi ' ' ion . 
The station now run ' via cable 

throughout the San Diego 
area, 

There are several ways that 
KSOT could broadcast on 
campus. but all would require 
expensive installations, say 
officials at the station, These 
might inc1ud the ins tallat ion 
of a c1o:ed wire svstem. a cable 
wire within th universllv. or 
t he use of an FM carr ier 
current. The exact costs of 
these sYstems are undeter-
mined, -

Obtaining an FCC licens 
may also be expensil'e and 
difficult , especially in the an 
Diego·Tiajuana area which 
already has crowded airwaves, 
due partially to conflicting 
:tat ions, 

nt il the $10,000 d cis ion is 
made, K 01' will be funded for 
operating cost.; on a weekly 
basis during the tllne of 
asses 'men!. The money will 
not go toward salaries, since 
all 40 workers at K D1' are 
I'olunteers. 

The ta k force will be 

comprised of two representa· 
tive ' from K DT, three 
members of t he AS Council, 
and one member of the 
Student Cent r Board. In 
addition to assessing K DT 
options for campus wide 
broadcast ing, they will also 
examine the s tation's 
managerial st ruct ure, 

The tudent Center Board 
alreadv once shut down KSDT 
and fn>ze t heir budget aft er the 
tat Ion broadcast an interview 

with Ku Klux Klan official 
Tom Metzger in July. 

During the Metzge r 
interview. a gruup of about 13 
protesting student s. including 
Bagneris, gathered around 
KSDT and expressed their 
anger wit h his racist I'iews. 
K 'DT officials insist that they 
were not endorsing Met zger, 
but were si mply exposing his 
views LO st udents on campus, 

The official reason the A 
gave for shutting down K DT 
was that the presence of 
Met zger on campus showed "a

, But when the board learned 
that the A on l y had

Unfortunately , too many

Military cooperation with 
NA A, in building the pace 
shuttle, has given "helping" 
right to the armed forces. In 
fact, the space shuttle was 
redesigned in order to make 
room for various defense 

weapons , Former Air Force

system would consist of 60 
satellites, each with 18 quare

By LYNETTE TOM 
Who says theater audiences have to go 

a ll the way to downtown San Diego (and 
often pay through the proverbial nose) to 
see a professional production at the Old 
Globe or Fox? Certainly not the UCSD 
Drama Department. which is 
understandably proud to inaugurate ih 
ProSerie~, an annual event which will 
feature a trio of acting troupes and /or 
solo performers. 

The season opens with a threeday tour 
of The Acting Company. Founded by 
actor John Houseman and based at the 
John F. Kennedy Center in Washington 
D.C., its mem bers will perform the 
following plays; William WycherJey's 
The emU/try WI/e, Carlo Goldoni's Jl 
Campiello , and Samuel Beckett 's Wailing 
For Codol, to be shown on October 16,17, 
and 18, respectively. Two pleasant 
surprises await UCSD viewers in the last 
production in the form s of Alan 
Schneider and Richard Iglewski .The 
former , a UCSD professor, will once 
again direct the play. The first time was 
twenty five years ago in the American 
premiere star:-ing Bert Lahr (better 
known as the Cowardly Lion in The 
Wizard Of Oz). The lat ter, portrayi ng 
ESlragon, is one of three UCSD drama 
st udents elected by The Acting 
Company. 

Harpo Marx fans should markJanuary 
23 as a don ' t miss date for Lee 
Marderosian's Love Me And The Wol'ld Is 
Mine: A Tribute To Harpo Marx. It is a 
diverting combination of excerpts from 
the comedian' s own autobiography, film 
clips. and Marderosian 's stage and screen 
impersonations. And for the Literary· 
minded and musically·oriented, there's 
the April 24 appearance of Nightclub 
Cantata. Playwright / poet Elizabeth 

wados takes the compositions of Sylvia 
Plath. Pablo eruda. Frank O'Hara. 
David Avidan , Nazim Hikmet , Eve 
Merriam, and their colleagues and 
transforms them into a musical that 
bespeaks of the caberet tradit ion. 

All productions will be hown at the 
Mandeville Auditorium. howt ime i ' at 8 
pm. Subscriptions to the ProSeries are 
$14 for students and $18 for general 
admission. ingle tickets are $5 
(students) and $7.50 (general admission). 
Tickets for The Acting Company can be 
purchased through University Events. 
which co· sponsors the tour. only.

Waterpolo expects strong '81 season 
UCSD to face tough UC Irvine in home opener 

BY TIM PICKWELL 
Water polo coach Denny 

Harper has introduced a new 
phenomenon into UCSD 
aquatics: It's called the BIG 
TIME . 

As in BIG TIME competi-
tion. 

Harper and his t eam 
returned this week from the 
pre tigiou s UC Irvine 
tournament , where, says the 
two-year coach, "We played 
more top level teams in one 
weekend than the program 
had ever played before. " 

The weeke nd was the 
culminatio n of Harper 's 
effort to upgrade the water 
polo program. Since the time 
he acquired the job in April of 
1980, the energetic long-time 
player has at tempted to 
schedule the top teams on the 
West Coast and in the nation. 

Because of his success, the 
NCAl\ Division III Triton 
now find themselve pi tted 
against "uch Division I powers 
as Berkeley. Stanford , UCLA 
ancl l'S ' , and UCSD is 
apparent I. giving the larger 
'chool..; ... ome l·ompetition. The 
team h~l~ a r('('ord of two wms, 

~IX l()s~es. and twu ties. They 
defeated Rrown t'niversit v. a 
dommant Eastern club, and 
advann>cl In two rounds of the 
Irvine tllurney. 

The Tritons early-season 
performances include an 
Incredible 4-4 tie wit h the U B 
Bears and a tough 9-6 10 <; to 
top-ranked Stanford. 

" If there were professional 
\ '< at er polo teams," Harper 
figures, " they wou ld be just 
\I kc thes(' schools." 

The ream, however, was not 
happ\ with these moral 

victories. "They were mad . 
They thought we should have 
won, " said Harper. 

This year 's group, described 
by Harper as "scrappy," is 
probably the fa s tes t in 
UCSD 's his tory. 

The defense is anchored by 
goalie Willy Morris, an AIl-
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association performer, and 
collegiate All-American. Co-
captain Morris, a senior, was 
the MVP on last year 's 19-10 
team. He set a school record 
w ith 238 blocked shots, and 
already ha 59 in the season's 
fi rst ten games Steve " Mouse" 
Marks, a senior lead ' UC 0 in 
scoring with 17 goal s. Dan 
Crane, also a senior, who run 
th e offense and absor bs most 
of the oppos ition's foal ~ thp 
second in goals scored with 15. 
Other major contributors are 
Kai Loedel. w ho led the team in 
scor ing in 1979, a nd co-
captain, Toby Raymond. 

The unit also h a some 
promi ing freshm a n , most 
notably Bill Kazmierowicz. 
Harpe,: descr ibes him a ' the 
fastel-ot man on t he squad and a 
"definite blue-chip recruit." 

Allot her p layer . Greg 
Buchanan, suffered an eye 
injur~ against USC Sunday 
and i~ sti ll hospitalized in 
Newport Beach. Buchanan 
wi ll be missed w hen the 
T r itons tangle wit h heavy-
weight UC Irvine tomorrow at 
.J. pm. 

The game w ill be UCSD's 
home ope n er and the 
inaugural match in their new 
pool on Mi ramar Road. ( ee 
map). 

Moving to the larger facili ty 
was a prime factor in Harper ' 

effort to improve the program. 
The shallow campus sw im· 
ming hole deterred tronger 
univers it ies from traveling to 
San Diego. and hindered the 
Tritons' ability to compete in a 
regulation pool. 

"We really had no chance at 
all in the old pool," Har per 
reveals. " [t was like pract ici ng 

in a bat htub and playing in an 
ean." 
Harper has seen his team 

improve radically s ince he 
instituted two-a-day practices 
a nd spr ing a nd summer 
leagues. He expects them to 
keep improving and hopes to 
achieve the goals of competing 
with big schools and reaching 
t he NCAA playoffs. 

To reach post-season play, 
the veteran coach feels his 
team must win the four team 
California Collegiate Athlet ic 
Association (UC Riverside, Cal 

tate LA, San Luis Obispo, 
and UCSD) and knock off some 
top team . 

Saturday the Tritons will 
face Claremont.

Large Crowd 
Expected for 
Intramural 
P;~ogram zn 
1981 

By VALERI S. ANDERS 
Stoft Writer 

UCSD's intramural compe· 
titian gets underway this 
weekend with an expected 
student participation larger 
than ever before. Sports 
offered this fall include team 
tennis, floor hockey, volley· 
ball, innertube waterpolo, flag 
foot ball , and three on three 
basketball . 

Each intramural sport is 
divided into three divis ions. 
Division A is for those with the 
basic skills who play for 
recreation. In Division AA, 
competition is a bit stronger, 
while Di vision AAA is for the 
experienced player who 'eeks 
the highest competi tion. 

Student referees are u ed to 
officiate intramural game . All 
referees must attend a 
training cliniC, pass a written 
lest, and prove they have the 
abi lity to referee in game 
situat ion ' (in addition to 
putting up wit h irate player ). 
These rep ' insu re that each 
intramural contest is played 
by the same set of rules, which 
is necessary, since over 4 ,000 
players are involved each 
Quarter. 

Those interested in starting 
an intramural team of their 
own can do so by coming by the 
intramural office and filling 
out the proper form for their 
. port, and attendi ng the 
captain " meeting for their 
chosen sport. Captains must 
attend this meeting to sign up 
their teams. Times of the 
meetings are posted in the 
intramural office with some 
meetings as early as today . 

Mike Hipp and Scott 
Berndes , directors of the 
intramural office, stress that 
there is a growing number of 
people signing up in the 
program every Quarter, so 
interested students should 
move Quickly to a s ure 
themselves a place in this 
Quarter's action . 

Many special intramu ral 
events are planned for this 
year. A "Budweiser Team Of 
The Week" will be chosen by 
the Bud Man , and a feature 
article and picture of the team 
wi ll be shown in the Guardian. 
Tournaments will be held 
every weekend, and the Bud 
Super Sports are happening 
Oct. 17. In this competition, 
over 25 teams from UCSD will 
compete against teams from 
SDSU and USD. Each team 
will consi s t of 8 team 
members, and w ill compete in 
a total of 6 events; frisbee toss, 
8·80 relay , round -a- bud , 
ca noeing, voll eyba ll , and 
obstacle course. 

Any interested student or 
staff member can play in the 
intramural sports program. If 
you would like to play on a 
team, but are new to the 
' choo l, ju s t attend t he 
captain' s meeting for the sport
