Despite facing $750 million in state funding cuts for the 2011-12 academic year, the University of 
California will loan the state $200 million 
on Feb. 29. The $200 million loan is just a 
portion of the $3.3 billion needed to keep the 
state in the black.   

The state is expected to fall below its 
safety cushion of $2.5 billion by the end of 
the month and in more than a week will fall 
$730 million in the red, state controller John 
Chiang said in “California could run out of 
cash by March, controller warns” in the Jan. 
31 Los Angeles Times. 

According to the Los Angeles Times, Gov. 
Jerry Brown signed a bill on Feb. 3 that will 
allow the state to borrow from special funds, 
such as those allocated for transportation or 
scientific research. The bill will make $865 
million available. The rest of the funding 
will be made up from loans from the UC 
and California State University systems and 
delaying reimbursements for doctors of state-
provided healthcare programs. 

“As we all know, the state of California is 
in a pretty bad financial situation,” UC Office 
of the President spokesperson Dianne Klein 
said. “They came to us and Cal State and 
asked, ‘Can you loan us money so we don’t 
default?’ As a gesture of good will, we agreed.”

In addition to the UC loan, the CSU 
system will loan the state up to $250 million, 
according to the Daily Californian. 

California’s revenue is $2.6 billion less 
than projected, while spending is higher by 
about the same amount, according to the San 
Francisco Chronicle. 

“We have to go out and borrow this money 
ourselves, it’s not like we can open a drawer 
and fling cash about,” Klein said.

According to Klein, the UC system has 
a better credit rating than the state and will 
borrow the requested $200 million at an 
interest rate of 0.5 percent. The UC system 
will loan the $200 million to the state at an 
interest rate of 2 percent.

“We don’t want to lose money in the deal,” 
Klein said.

Klein said the state originally requested 
the loan by March 2, but recently expedited 
the loan to Feb. 29. The state is expected to 
pay back the loan by April 20 of this year. 

“We’ve been in talks with the state 
government for a while to find a long-term 
funding plan for the UC,” Klein said. “This 
is part of the process. We understand that 
they have a cash flow problem, so we’re 
in a position to help them out. We’re all 
Californians and we all want the same things. 
This is not in an adversarial way, and we’re in 
a position that we can loan this money.”

According to Klein, the state already owes 
the UC system $1.7 billion.

“It’s not that we want to keep doing this,” 
Klein said. “For the time being, it’s what we 
feel is the best thing to do.”

Student Business Services will be opening 
a survey to students on Feb. 15. They will be 
using this input to improve their ability to serve 
students

Every year, Vice Chancellor of External and 
Business Affairs Steven Relyea’s metrics division 
invites approximately 25,000 students to take 
the Student Satisfaction Survey and provide 
feedback on various student business services. 
The feedback is later discussed and analyzed at a 
retreat by Relyea’s metrics division.

“The responses [on the survey] are looked 

at and discussed carefully to see what needs 
to be changed,” Communications Manager for 
Business and Financial Services Barbara Field 
said.

Specifically, they look at budget allocations, 
resources and what can be improved for specific 
business services. Changes have already been 
made based on the past years of the survey.

Mail services, for example, no longer delivers 
junk mail to students living on campus. They 
also send email alerts when a package is received 
from the United States Postal Service. These 
changes were first implemented based on results 
of the survey.

Students from historically black colleges 
and universities will be able to participate 
in a new University of California fellowship 
program called Summer Institute for 
Emerging Managers. UC Provost Lawrence 
Pitts announced the program at a Jan. 24 
press conference in the Robinson Memorial 
in Pasadena.

SIEML will accept 25 students this summer 
and will take place every year at one of six 
participating UC business and management 
schools. They include UC Berkeley’s Haas 
School of Business, UCSD’s Rady School of 
Management, the UC Davis Graduate School 
of Management, UC Irvine’s Paul Merage 
School of Business, UCLA’s Anderson School 
of Management and UC Riverside’s A. Gary 
Anderson Graduate School of Management.

“We hope the experience for those students 
selected to attend SIEML will aid them in 
successful enrollment in professional degree 
programs such as the MBA,” UC Provost 
Lawrence Pitts said in a Jan. 24 UC Office of 
the President press release. 

The program is currently offered 
to undergraduate students enrolled at 
Morehouse College, Hampton University, 
Howard University and Florida A&M, among 
others. 

Selected students will be offered an all-
expenses-paid trip to one of the six UC 
business programs. They will spend two weeks

BIRDLAND By Rebekah Dyer

VISUAL DIARY By Khanh Nguyen

BY MICHAEL CHANG
Staff Writer

Back in a time when writing 
on someone’s wall implied crude 
scribblings on their side of a 
cave, humans had already begun 
utilizing social-networking as a 
way to stay connected.

A recent study by Harvard and 
UCSD researchers suggests that 
ancient hunter-gatherers had 
interactions similar to the social 
networking of today’s Facebook 
or LinkedIn. This helps answer 
whether networking is a product 
of modern technology or if it 
could have been a survivalist tool 
utilized by ancient man.

The existence of an ancient 
social network system that 
allowed cooperative and altruistic 
humans to gather together would 
help explain why these facets of 
human life exist today. Some even 
theorize that selfishness would 
have out-competed selflessness 
without this form of networking.

“We found that what 

modern people are doing with 
online social networks is what 
we’ve always done, not just 
before Facebook, but before 
agriculture,” UCSD professor 
James Fowler said in a Jan. 25 
campus press release.

The researchers studied 
the Hadza, an ethnic group 
in northern Tanzania. Within 
it is a smaller population that 
still practices the traditional 
hunter-gatherer model 
of living, which predates 
agriculture and domesticated 
animals. Fowler and Nicholas 
Christakis, a professor at 
Harvard Medical School, chose 
this group not only because of 
the lifestyle, but also because 
of its level of genetic isolation.

Researchers administered 
tests that were co-created by 
Fowler. First they asked the 
adults whom they would 
prefer to live with. Later, 
knowing that honey was a 
favorite food among many of 
the Hadza, each adult received 

three honey straws and was told 
to distribute them to friends. 
This would allow the team to

T his week’s A.S. Council meet-ing was full of serious politics and Valentine’s Day love.
Associate Vice President of 

A c a d e m i c 
Affairs Mac 
Zilber reported 
a record 300 
students applying 
for A.S. grants. 
Ap p r ox i m at e l y 
$50,000 is 
necessary to fulfill 
the need.

Vice President of Student Life 
Meredith Madnick was so excited 
to announce the location for this 
quarter’s A.S. Council Retreat that 
she asked everyone to begin a drum 
roll. I suppose laser tag is a pretty epic 
way to spend a retreat, and I would 
bet that Madnick should expect a 
heavy turnout.

“You’re not required to go, but I 
will heavily judge you if you don’t,” 
Madnick said. As if council needed 
any other motivation to go.

Vice President of External Affairs 
Samer Naji attended a California 
State Board meeting where it was 
decided that a millionaire’s tax will 
be put on the ballot, so that anyone 
making more than $1 million a year 
will be taxed. This money will mostly 
go to higher education.

Muir Senator Leah Wong 
announced that all the UCs will be 
collaborating in the creation of a 
“Shit Broke UC Students Say” video, 
where five students from each UC 
will be filmed on their campus saying 
some shit that broke UC students 
would say.

A.S. President Alyssa Wing 
has already taken some action in 
response to an email sent out by 
UCSD Recreation Services to students 
enrolled in Recreation classes that 

clearly advocated the support of 
Division-I sports.

“No department or staff member 
should be influencing the vote,” 

she said. “Vice 
C h a n c e l l o r 
Penny Rue is 
already aware 
of it and is 
taking action. 
We are asking 
the Recreation 
office if they can 

issue a public apology for a breach of 
neutrality.”

After this dark revelation, 
Madnick lightened things up with 
the announcement of Sixth Senator 
Cody Marshall for Council Member 
of the Week! He strutted his stuff 
to LMFAO’s “Sexy and I Know It,” 
which seemed appropriate since he 
was nominated for Council Member 
of the Week for his Division-I speed 
dating event.

Madnick and Vice President of 
Finance and Resource Kevin Hoang 
announced that they want all of 
council to be their valentines this 
year. They distributed Sweetheart 
candies and even saved a box for me. 
How sweet.

This was followed by a very 
serious discussion about whether the 
External Affairs office should be given 
funding for a new scanner, since they 
are responsible for scanning voter 
registration forms. The funding was 
eventually allocated.

Muir Senator Elizabeth Garcia 
opened a discussion regarding the 
placement of a question about what 
students want to see happen to CLICS 
on the special election ballot. After 
some editing, a question was deemed 
worthy of a student vote. Look for it 
on this year’s special election ballot.

Business

Program to Begin at Haas School at UC Berkeley in May
learning about different areas within 
business. Instructors will consist of 
UC business school faculty. 

UCSD Rady School of 
Management Dean Robert S. 
Sullivan said that students will 
learn networking skills as they are 
introduced to chief executive officers 
and chief financial officers from local 
businesses. The participating students 
will also be guaranteed internships in 
management environments. 

“The program will allow the 
[UC system] to build relationships 
and a long-term rapport with the 
faculty at the universities that are 
recommending the students,” Sullivan 
said. “Even when they go back we 
are hoping there will be mentor-
student relationship, and that they 
will continue to communicate beyond 

the two-week program.”
Executive Director of the 

undergraduate program at Berkeley’s 
Haas School of Business Erica Walker 
said that deans from the six business 
schools sent letters to partnering 
historically black colleges and asked 
that they begin to identify students for 
the program. Students will be selected 
based on their academic performance 
during their first year of college. 
According to the SIEML website, 
students must have at least a 3.0 GPA, 
demonstrate leadership skills and 
display an interest in management 
positions in the fields of business, 
engineering, healthcare, government 
or the non-profit sector. Applicants 
must also receive recommendations 
from faculty at their colleges and 
universities.

“We are limiting the pilot program 

to 25 students mainly for budgetary 
reasons,” Walker said. “After the first 
summer we will learn some things and 
at that point we will look at expanding 
the program to larger numbers as well 
as other underrepresented groups 
such as Hispanics.”

Prospective students must turn in 
applications by March 30 and will 
be notified by April 16 if they are 
selected. The 2012 program will 
run from Sunday, May 20 through 
Saturday, June 2. 

SIEML will last for two consecutive 
summers with the initial session 
taking place at UC Berkeley. For the 
second summer, the students will be 
invited to a different UC campus not 
yet identified for another two weeks.

Student Feedback Collected Annually to Improve Campus Life

Additionally, E-Communications 
has observed through past surveys 
that Apple products make up 57 
percent of network-enabled devices 
used by students on campus. They 
are now putting more resources 
toward Apple products and 
interfaces.

Student feedback is also what 

drove Student Business Services to 
create an e-check payment option. 
Now, 80 percent of students pay 
UCSD through e-check.

Students also asked the bookstore 
to expand their non-book products, 
such as dorm supplies, toiletries and 
gifts. Bookstore shoppers can see 
that these products are now available 
and the selection changes every year 
depending on student needs.

Both undergraduate and graduate 
students may be invited to take the 
survey.

“Ideally, at least 40 to 50 percent 
of the people we invite would take 
the survey,” Field said. 

This year’s survey will open on 
Feb. 15 and run through March 14.

draw out initial social ties among the 
participants.

Scientists also studied friend 
connectivity between other traits, 
such as height, strength, food 
preference, and the transitivity of 
friendship, which is whether or not 
people had mutual friends. 

When the researchers mapped 
the data by examining the camp 
ties and the transfer of straws, they 
discovered how sharers were often 
friends with other sharers while 
non-sharers were friends with 
other non-sharers, with little to no 
intermingling in between. 

“We turned the data over lots of 
different ways,” Fowler said. “We 

looked at over a dozen measures 
that social network analysts use to 
compare networks and pretty much, 
the Hadza are just like us.”

Fowler could not be reached 
for comment as of press time.

Susan G. Komen’s decision on Feb. 3 to reinstate funding to Planned Parenthood has been 
trumpeted as a clear victory for 
pro-choice advocates. The breast 
cancer awareness organization pulled 

$650,000 of funding from 16 Planned 
Parenthood affiliates 72 hours prior, 
under claims that they don’t fund 
institutions under governmental 
scrutiny. It was only after immense 
public pressure from politicians, non-
profits and ordinary people through 
social media sites that they decided to 
reverse their decision.

It’s a big win, to be sure, but for 
pro-choice advocates, the fight is 
hardly over. This is not the first time 
that Susan G. Komen has come under 
pressure from anti-abortion groups 
to pull its funding from Planned 
Parenthood. Many groups cite the fact 
that Planned Parenthood-sponsored 
mammograms and biopsies are not 
provided in-house, but are actually 
referrals. Others, better at getting to 
the point, cite their refusal to work 
with an organization that provides 
abortions. Particularly staunch 
churches and religious schools have 
gone as far as to boycott Komen-
sponsored breast cancer awareness 
walks and runs for their continued 
funding of Planned Parenthood. 

Faced with this continued 
backlash, a few staffers within 
Komen, according to the Los Angeles 
Times, began meeting in private to 
discuss how to deal with the Planned 
Parenthood backlash. In the end, they 
decided to continue funding to avoid 
any controversy. 

This very astute decision clearly 
did not impact Susan G. Komen’s 
senior vice president of public 
policy, Karen Handel, a staunch pro-
lifer. She had formerly run as the 
Republican nominee for governor in 
2010, ironically losing because she 
was not considered pro-life enough. 
Handel, along with a number of 
anti-abortion supporters at Susan 
G. Komen, saw the government’s 
investigation of Planned Parenthood 
in September as a golden opportunity. 
The investigation in question, 
started by Rep. Cliff Sterns (R-Fla.), 
operated under the belief that Planned 
Parenthood illegally uses public funds 
to pay for abortions. 

Despite the fact that Komen 
Chief Executive Nancy Brinker 
claimed that the decision to pull 
Planned Parenthood funding had 
unanimous support in the Susan 
G. Komen foundation, the rush of 
Komen resignations following the 
announcement speaks otherwise.

This controversy can be a learning 
experience for Susan G. Komen. A 
women’s health organization needs 
to know exactly where it stands 
when it comes to the controversial 
topic of abortion rights. When half 
of Komen is continuing to pressure 
the organization to drop funding for 
Planned Parenthood and the other 
half is willing to quit over the same 
issue, this is clearly something that 
will come up again.

When a Claremont McKenna College admissions o�cer admitted to in�ating SAT scores to improve rankings, the 
world of higher ed received the much-needed 
reminder that university is a business — dedicated 
to selling the school to yearning high school seniors 
and big-time academics alike. 

As a result of the Jan. 30 announcement, 
education experts have been weighing in on the 
internal pressure admissions o�cers face, but the 
greater focus should be on the role of the rankings 
themselves, the indicators used and the problem 
with  a system that can, and is, easily manipulated. 

Amid the discussion, “pressure” is not a 
satisfying justi�cation for falsifying information, 
as doing so creates both a slippery slope and a 
double standard. Professors rarely give free passes 
to students who plagiarize or cheat on exams due 
to academic pressure, and senior o�cials should be 
held to at least this standard. 

�at said, it’s easy to see where the temptation 
lies. According to UCLA’s Higher Education 
Research Institute, almost two-thirds of students 
cite “academic reputation” as the most important 
factor when selecting a school; in other words, they 

rely heavily on rankings, and especially the most 
hallowed ranking of them all: U.S. News & World 
Report. While there are those rare high school 
seniors who will conduct an in-depth study of 
various university options, most will glance at the 
ratings and, based on these, apply to some target, 
safety and reach schools, then call it a day. Yet 
according to the San Francisco Chronicle, a 2010 
rankings survey revealed that more than 80 percent 
of college admissions o�cers felt that U.S. News 
o�ered misleading conclusions, even as 70 percent 
came from schools that happily splashed their 
ranking across promotional materials. 

�e conclusions are worse a�er looking at 
the methodology of the U.S. News rankings. By 
far the most important factor, accounting for 
22.5 percent of �nal rankings, is “reputation” as 
determined by the opinions of those at similar 
schools. And “selectivity” — aka SAT scores and 
acceptance rate, which are gathered via the honor 
system — accounts for 15 percent of the ranking, 
nearly twice that of “graduation rate.” When the 
system that in�uences the decision of thousands 
nationwide is based on things as intangible as 
“opinion,” or self-reported factors like SAT scores, 

it’s no surprise that everyone starts fudging the 
facts. 

Although CMC is the most recent and most 
“prestigious” school to have been caught with these 
shenanigans, other universities are simply more 
blatant with their attempts to game the system. 

For example, Baylor University in Texas pays 
accepted students to retake the SAT so it can report 
higher scores. More commonly, schools o�en 
target outreach to students who have no chance of 
being accepted, simply so the acceptance rate goes 
down and the prestige goes up. 

Even we’ve been trying to rebrand for a while, 
whether it’s been morphing the name of the school 
from UCSD to UC San Diego, designing new �yers 
with pictures of happy students with sur�oards or 
the move to Division I sports that’s currently the 
talk of the town. 

Rankings are here to stay; they do have value 
and are simply too convenient in terms of reducing 
information cost to be tossed aside completely. But 
Claremont McKenna, Baylor and other universities 
that see them as a easily manipulated system show 
that their methodology should be reevaluated 
— and maybe these schools’ values too. 

When College Rankings Become a Game, Cheating is Inevitable 

Some worst-case scenarios are too terrible to stomach. And such is the case for San Diego 
Unified School District — faced 
with overwhelming state budget 
cuts, a stalwart teachers’ union and a 
terrifying lack of funds, the district 
superintendent issued a worst-case 
draft budget that includes, among 
others, a 1,200 across-the-board staff 
layoff. 

The draft budget is full of 
unpleasant realities. If the district sees 
a (likely) $122-million cut from state 
funding for the 2012-13 school year, 
then the following will happen under 
the new budget: 1,169 staff members 
laid off, including 781 teachers, 
dramatically increased class sizes that 
push the maximum allowed by the 
state and decreased funding to the arts, 
school nurses and security.  

This is based, of course, on the 
worst-case scenario that assumes that 
Gov. Jerry Brown’s budget ultimatum 

will fall through — a risky gamble that 
gives voters the choice of passing a tax 
raise on high-earning individuals in 
November or see the state funding ax 
fall on school funding. It also assumes, 
more pessimistically, that the teachers’ 
union and other teaching unions in the 
area demand their scheduled 7-percent 
raise in 2012-13 and a generous health 
care package. 

This is not to say, of course, that 
teachers do not deserve these funds. 
But when 90 percent of the district’s 
general fund budget is consumed by 
employee compensation and payment, 
and when the teachers’ union looks 
unlikely to concede even a small 
portion of their additional benefits, 
it is clear that hardnosed negotiating 
has shifted towards something akin to 
selfishness. 

District official predictions 
are even more significant — if the 

Worst-Case Scenario 
The San Diego Unified School District’s fatalistic plan to resolve its budget crisis ignores one 

key component — the union’s stronghold on district funding.

Dear Editor,
You might reasonably ask why 

I care about a referendum over 
a fee I won’t have to pay.  On a 
personal level the referendum 
doesn’t affect me one bit.  However, 
as a citizen, I take great pride in 
University of California and its 
campuses — the greatest system 
of public education the world has 
seen — and I fret when I see that 
greatness threatened.  There are 
two problems with a move towards 
NCAA Division I:  The first is 
that it’s fiscally irresponsible and 
the second is that it will damage 
the educational quality of UCSD, 
a campus which has so far been 
free of the negative influence of 
increasingly professionalized sports 
on college campuses.

We like to blame the investment 
bankers and hedge fund 
managers for the latest economic 
crisis.  However, the cause of the 
housing bubble and bust was people 
paying for luxuries they could not 
afford; the financial industry just 
decided to take quick profits by 
looking the other way. We have 
all paid for this carelessness with 
lost jobs, lost homes and recession. 
Division-I athletics is exactly one 
of those luxuries we cannot afford 
right now. Education is the engine 
behind the American dream and 
our economy.  It ought to be getting 
more affordable every year, not 
less. We’ve all seen the dramatic 
fee increases at UC over the last 
years and there’s likely more to 
come.  Some of you may be willing 
to pay an extra $495 a year.  But 
in these trying financial times, I 
don’t think it’s right to saddle future 
students with another burdensome 

fee, especially since fees have a way 
of increasing over time.

More costly than the fee itself 
is the negative impact Division-I 
athletics will have on the quality of 
a UCSD education.  I like attending 
sporting events as much as many of 
you.  But UCSD is an educational 
institution, not a training program 
for professional athletes. Our 
priority must be educational 
quality.  Our job prospects depend 
upon employers recognizing that 
a UCSD diploma means we’ve 
received a rigorous education.  One 
need only look at the various 
academic scandals involving 
athletics that are constantly reported 
to realize the dangers.  Some of 
these scandals have been close to 
home: Stanford’s athletic department 
recently circulated a list of suggested 
easy courses to student athletes and 
athletes at Berkeley were found to 
have received fraudulent grades for 
courses they hadn’t even attended 
in some cases.  Mind you, many 
student athletes are extremely 
capable students.  However, I think 
it’s clear that Division-I athletics, 
and the money involved, has been 
a massive source of corrupting 
influence in higher education.  At 
UCSD we know better than to 
jump on a bandwagon just because 
everyone else has.

D-I Move Damages 
Quality of Education

IN OTHER NEWS By Rebekah Hwang

November tax hikes pass and the unions agree to forgo 
their raises and take cuts to their health care packages, 
nearly all the planned layoffs can be avoided. Even if 
the tax hikes aren’t passed, deeper cuts to 
generous compensation packages can help 
avoid this catastrophe. After all, allowing 
nearly 1,200 layoffs — to protect the raises of 
those teachers who avoid pink slips next year 
— is a plan that lacks altruism. 

The leader of the teachers’ union, the San 
Diego Education Association, has dismissed 
the school district’s worst-case scenario 
worries with a claim that it is too “cynical,” 
that the district has been faced with 
overwhelming budget cuts in the past and 
has persevered. Gov. Jerry Brown has urged 
school districts to pass optimistic budgets, based on his 
projected tax increase and a huge dose of confidence. But 

wisely, school districts across the state, San Diego Unified 
included, have opted out and chosen to look at reality.

Now is not a time to be Pollyanna. Budget gimmicks 
and delaying solutions in the past have only served to 
move the problem to the next year, and the next year 

on. The state’s annual revenue has dropped 
$17 billion since 2007, and it is clear that 
education, more specifically K-12 education, 
will see the brunt of it. In the next two 
years, San Diego Unified will be operating 
under a $150-billion deficit, two-thirds of 
which can be attributed to the lack of union 
negotiations. But enough is enough.

The school district is up against a wall, 
and no matter what, will have to choose 
which tough cuts to make for the 2012-13 
school year. Just how tough these cuts will be 
will depend on whether the teachers’ union 

will finally recognize the direness of the situation and 
make concessions. 

If tax hikes aren’t 
passed, deeper 
cuts to generous 
compensation 
packages can 
help avoid this 
catasrophe.

Disney Can’t 
Compete 
With Ghibli 
Classics
A nime frightens me. Maybe it’s the generally dark subject matter or the foreign cultural tropes that 
are still alien to me, but the anima-
tion style has never failed to strike 

an unsettling chord. Yet, for as much 
as it has left me slightly perturbed, 
anime has always been within reach 
for me — particularly that of Hayao 
Miyazaki’s Studio Ghibli.

Growing up with Buddhist parents 
meant, among other things, countless 
childhood hours spent dawdling in 
activity rooms stocked with rows of 
Japanese kids movies — strange and 
colorful pop-cultural artifacts that, 
for a white suburban kid whose best 
friend was a Mormon named Lance, 
may as well have come from another 
planet. But I watched them — always 
in awe, sometimes in curious fear — 
and Miyazaki’s classics made their 
way into a heavy rotation. There was 
the sky-bound fantasy epic “Laputa” 
and the slightly more adult and 
considerably more violent “Princess 
Mononoke,” but it was Studio Ghibli’s 
coming-of-age masterpiece “Spirited 
Away” that had me floored — though 
it took me a decade to understand 
why. 

It’s difficult to classify “Spirited 
Away” (or anything Ghibli, for that 
matter) as a “cult” film. When it was 
released back in 2001, it was the high-
est grossing movie in the history of 
Japanese cinema. However, at least for 
the Disney-reared American, it does 
follow much of the cult criteria: It’s 
gorgeous, foreign, strange and wildly 
un-mainstream. And for a film pri-
marily about childhood, presumably 
for children, it is completely devoid 
of rehashed Disney archetypes (no 
ultra-delicate females matched to 
puffy-lipped male counterparts, no 
evil-for-sake-of-evil villains, no rococo 
wedding reception finale).

It’d be pointless to try and describe 
every nuance of the film here: the 
complex characters, the perfect score, 
the expertly crafted fables-within-a-
fable, the breathtaking hand-drawn 
artwork. (I’ll go ahead and blame my 
recent concentration troubles on a 
hardcover book of stills from the film 
that a friend gifted me for my birth-
day.) But the most salient of “Spirited 
Away”’s qualities is the fact that it isn’t 
simply a film about the adolescent 
experience — it is the experience. 

As Chihiro arrives at her new 
home — after leaving her old friends 
and school behind — she stumbles 
into a massive nightmare world filled 
with dangerous monsters and daunt-
ing responsibilities. She has her name 
literally taken from her, leaving her 
to construct a new identity in this 
foreign place while clinging to the 
memory of her old one.  In the mean-
time, she slowly begins to find that all 
of the seemingly hostile inhabitants of 
the ghostly bathhouse are just lonely, 
self-conscious or themselves without 
an identity. 

And that’s exactly what it’s like 
when you’re growing up. The world

LEAPING OUT 
OF THE SCREEN

Producer Charlotte 
Huggins talks 3D bliss.
By Ren Ebel • 
Hiatus Editor

F
or the casual movie-goer, filing 
into cramped theater seats and 
donning the dorky glasses that 
accompany any 3D movie might 

easily ooze “gimmick.” For Charlotte 
Huggins, it’s sacred ritual. 

The film producer and UCSD alum 
is one of the world’s most prolific pro-
ducers of 3D films — from blockbusters 
like 2008’s “Journey to the Center of the 
Earth” to those nostalgic “4D experience” 
attractions at theme parks (remem-
ber Disneyland’s “Honey I Shrunk the 
Audience”?). 

It’s a pretty remarkable achievement 
in such a specialized field, and it certainly 
wasn’t Huggins’ plan back in 1980. 

“It was a very unexpected but 
straightforward route,” Huggins said 
in an interview with the Guardian 
Wednesday. “I graduated a quarter early 
but I wanted to do the whole graduation 
ceremony, so I got a local job at World 
Research as an economic researcher. And 
they made movies that had to do with 
economic topics.” 

During this time, Huggins was 
approached by a USC Film School writer 
about possibly producing a short, high-
concept docu-drama. But at that time she 
had aspirations for law school and inter-
national business.

“He showed up at my door one day 
and we wrote a script for a little docu-
mentary called ‘Interview 15,’” Huggins 
said. “And it ended up winning all these 

awards all over the world.”
On the heels of this unprecedented 

success, law school began to sound a lot 
less attractive. Huggins moved to Los 
Angeles and began working her way 
up the ladder as a production assistant. 
Soon, she began writing for the hugely 
successful police drama series “Hunter” 
with writing partner and now-husband 
Tom Huggins, up until the Writers Guild 
strike of 1988. 

“It’s funny; [Tom] had an undergradu-
ate degree in film and I had an under-
graduate degree in political science, and 
during the strike he went back to UCLA 
to get a Ph.D. in biology while I got a job 
at an FX company,” Huggins said.

At Boss Films, Huggins had her first 
exposure to early 3D, working on such 
projects as Sony’s “Wings of Courage”

more, the band’s notoriously tight live performers possess the kind 
of easy improvisatory energy that characterizes bands like Phish and

ALBUM REVIEWS

O ver the last 15 years, French synth duo Air has carved an increasingly limited 
niche, crafting restrained, down-
tempo pop songs more evocative of 
sleek interior design than anything 
else. This arc climaxed with Air’s 
two most recent albums, Pocket 
Symphony and Love 2, which were 
stylish to the point of total boredom.

On Le Voyage Dans la Lune, 
designed as a soundtrack to Georges 
Méliès’ 1902 silent film of the same 
title, Air attempts to combat this 
creative stagnation, trading their 
normally inoffensive synthesizer 
textures for tom-heavy live drums, 
unwieldy synth experiments and 
even the occasional distorted gui-
tar. On some tracks this approach 
works well, like the brash, driving 
“Sonic Armada” or album highlight 
“Seven Stars,” which pairs aggres-
sive motorik rhythms with smooth 
piano chords and a characteristi-
cally breathy vocal by Beach House’s 
Victoria Legrand.

Nonetheless, Voyage contains 
too much filler to really operate as 
a cohesive album. Tracks like the 
aimless “Décollage” and the drowsy 

Brian Eno imitation “Lava,” though 
pretty, aren’t interesting enough to 
sustain the listener’s attention, while 
the cutesy “Who Am I Now,” the 
album’s only other non-instrumental 
song, fails to meet the high standard 
set by “Seven Stars.”

But even though Le Voyage Dans 
la Lune is flawed (perhaps a short 
EP would have been better suited 
to the material), it may mark the 
beginning of a new period in Air’s 
history, one in which the group is 
willing to stray from its normally 
tidy approach to music making. This 
development, though not completely 
fulfilled on Le Voyage, is an exciting 
one indeed.

I t’s a story you’ve read on blogs time and time again: Indie-pop trio Tennis was formed by hus-
band and wife Patrick Riley and 
Alaina Moore, who used a sailing trip 
up the Atlantic as inspiration for their 
debut Cape Dory. 

Unsurprisingly, the band is 
especially sick of hearing this cutesy 

background, which is why they make 
a point to distance themselves from all 
things nautical on follow-up Young & 
Old. In case it wasn’t obvious enough: 
Moore goes so far to croon “I took a 
train to/ I took a train to get you” in 
the opening lines.

See, they’re traveling via locomo-
tive now — not sailboat. 

That’s not the only change found 
on Tennis’ second effort. With the 
Black Keys’ Patrick Carney on board 
as producer and drummer James 
Barone fully integrated in the lineup, 
the band is bolder than ever. 

Take first single “Origins”: While 
certainly no wall of sound, the track 
sees the band trading Dory’s jangly 
beach-pop for richer girl-group vibes, 
with crisp backup vocals and (oddly 

enough) a bluesy guitar solo thrown 
into the standard indie-pop mix.

 “Petition,” in particular, sounds 
exactly like a Black Keys song, only 
with Moore’s Diana Ross-like vocals 
instead of the expected soulful growl. 
Even the lyrics take a turn for the 
dark: “High Road” culminates in 
Moore belting, “Paradise is all around, 
but happiness is never found” — glum 
stuff for a band with a track called 
“Waterbird” in their discography. 

But despite this refreshing change 
of pace from the band, the sweetest 
moments are when Tennis surrenders 
to the melody and own their trade-
mark whimsy.

O f the 2000s’ endless supply of precious Brit-rockers, it comes as no surprise that 
Field Music managed to maintain rel-
evancy in the new decade, with their 
sound sustaining a certain maturity 
that draws confidently from pop icons 
of the past.  And Plumb, the fourth 

release from David and Peter Brewis, 
may be the duo’s most inspired work 
to date. 

Instantly recognizable here is the 
’70s power-pop influence, occasion-
ally owing the likes of Paul McCartney 
and Electric Light Orchestra a royalty 
check or two. “Start the Day Off”’s 
robust major-chord melodies are 
accompanied by a wistful string 
and woodwind backdrop, while the 
oversized chorus on “Sorry Again, 
Mate” wouldn’t feel out of place on 
a Badfinger record. The vocal lines 
on “A Prelude to Pilgrim Street” even 
manage to echo David Gilmour’s 
accented chants from Dark Side of 
the Moon — a testament, also, to the 
album’s immaculate production.  

But there are a handful of throw-
aways that seem half-heartedly 
attached merely for their technical 
elegance (see dragging instrumentals 
“Ce Soir” and “So Long Then”).

Fittingly, Field Music is most 
dynamic at their most conventional. 
The confident guitar grit of throb-
bing rockers “Just Like Everyone 
Else” and “(I Keep Thinking) About 
a New Thing” solidly anchors the 
album. Plumb’s singular gem lies in 
the straightforward groove of “A New 
Town,” where proggy guitar shuffle 
builds pleasant steam from start to 
finish.

is huge and terrifying and filled 
with beauty. You’re scared to tears 
of what might be lurking in the 
backyard, but the urge to find out 
is too powerful to resist. Before we 
learned to so sternly dismiss it, we 
embraced the unknown, if only out 
of pure necessity. And so we were 
constantly in this state of violent 
transition — be it a new school, 
new friends, a new haircut, a new 
hobby. It was bizarre and it was 
enthralling. 

Sadly, now that Studio Ghibli 
is under the inevitable Disney 
blanket, the Miyazaki stamp has 
become less and less distinctive. 
Recents such as “The Cat Returns” 
— though not wholly without the 
occasional visual stunner — have 
settled for more generic plots and 

lazy, two-dimensional characters. 
The new trailer for this year’s 

installment, the upcoming “Secret 
World of Arrietty” based on “The 
Borrowers,” doesn’t offer much 
hope for a return to the days of 
shape-shifting raccoons, suave 
man-pig fighter pilots and the won-
derfully strange spirits who only 
come out at night.  

But we still have the classics. 
What’s remarkable about a film like 
“Spirited Away” is how it manages 
to offer something new with each 
viewing. When I was 10, the film 
was a psychedelic parade of spell-
binding worlds and characters. In 
another 10 years, who knows? For 
now, it’s a fleeting glimpse of how it 
felt to be a kid completely in awe of 
the world, and that’s magic worth 
preserving.

Disney Tropes Threaten 
Studio Ghibli Genius and Disney’s “Honey I Shrunk the Audience.”

“I was hooked,” Huggins said. “I watched the way 
people reacted to it, and it was so immersive. I dreamt, 
then, that it would be more than a wave. It would be a 
tidal wave.” 

With practically every animated movie now being 
released in digital 3D, and the current second coming of 
3D re-releases, from the Disney classics to “Star Wars: 
Episode I,” clearly Huggins’ dreams have been surpassed. 
Not to mention, she’s found the perfect job. 

“The core of producing is setting up the best cir-
cumstances possible to make the best movie possible,” 
Huggins said. “I don’t do the job of the director, or the 
writer, or the cinematographer, but I get to find all those 
people, bring them all together and give them the most 
freedom and the most creative experience possible. And 
that’s incredibly satisfying.”

But what truly makes Huggins the perfect candidate 
for mass 3D production is the simple fact that she’s just 
3D’s biggest fan — a mark that becomes apparent listen-
ing to her gush about her latest project, “Journey 2: The 
Mysterious Island,” due out this Friday. 

“This weekend I will probably see ‘Journey’ — I hate 
to say it — six or seven times. I’ll see it in digital 3D, I’ll 

certainly see it in iMAX 3D, I’ll see it in 2D. I love watch-
ing people watch the movie.”

Speculations about the near future of 3D are met with 
even more excitement.

“The next big thing, I believe, is glasses-free 3D,” 
Huggins said. “The technology is there. The minute you 
can sit in your house and watch 3D without the glasses is 
the minute it really, truly becomes ubiquitous.”

In Huggins’ near future: a 3D collaborative film with 
Metallica — an as-of-yet under-wraps project that will 
combine a concert performance, narrative and “will star 
the five members of the band: James, Lars, Kirk, Robert 
and the fans.”

That’s one more of the countless surprises in the 
producer’s wildly varied career. (Huggins can’t help but 
chuckle at the notion of working with one of thrash 
metal’s most popular bands, though she adds, “they’re 
amazing, amazing people to work with.”) But as of now, 
Huggins is simply thankful that she stuck with her 
instincts.

“I worked hard at UCSD,” Huggins said. “I took 
French and Italian and a lot of business classes. I knew 
what I wanted to do and then, whammo, I started doing 
something totally different. At the end of the day, you 
gotta keep your eyes open.”

junior outfielder Danny Susdorf, who 
grounded out his first time at-bat but dou-
bled as the Tritons batted around. Seigel had 
the first hit of the inning and Tuck singled to 
left field to bring in Rahn, who was hit by a 
pitch to get on base. 

The Tritons rallied again in the fourth, 
led by freshman Ryan O’Malley doubling 
to right center. UCSD scored four in the 
inning, and the Western Oregon one-run 
response in the fifth and ninth innings was 
not enough to bring the team back.

 
GAME 3
FEB. 4

The Wolves squeaked by UCSD in the 
second half of Saturday’s doubleheader as 
both teams’ offenses fell flat.

Triton starter Greg Selarz went six 
innings, giving up two runs on eight hits 
and two errors. Tony York relieved for just 
one inning, giving up one hit and no runs 
as the game was called after only seven 
innings.

The Tritons took the lead 1–0 in the 
bottom of the second inning after LaFace 
doubled to left center and was subsequently 
batted in by a Garret Tuck sacrifice fly to 
the right field. 

The Triton offense only had three hits to 
Oregon’s eight hits.

GAME 4
FEB. 5

The Wolves outlasted the Tritons to take 
the series in a hard-fought finale.

Western Oregon jumped UCSD in the 

first inning, taking three runs as Wolf cen-
terfielder A.J. Royal tripled and was brought 
home by a Miller single down the right 
field line. The inning was capped off with a 
double down the left field line to make the 
score 3–0 as the Tritons came to bat.

The Tritons struggled to generate 
offense, but the team played smart small 
ball to pick up one run in the fifth, two runs 
in the sixth and one in the ninth. Battling 
from behind the whole game, the Tritons 
struggled to find peace with a pitcher, going 
through five in the game, four of whom only 
pitched for an inning before being pulled. 

The Tritons had the last at-bat, but failed 
to capitalize as Spencer Frazier struck out 
and Susdorf grounded out to the pitcher to 
end the series.

relieved by freshman pitcher Kayla Hensel, 
who ended the game, with the Tritons secur-
ing the lead 8–5.

GAME 2
FEB. 3

In the second game of the series, Gaito 
was replaced on the mound by junior Jennifer 
Manuel and freshman Michelle Escamilla. 
Escamilla recorded her first win as a Triton as 
the Tritons went down early. 

In the second inning, Northwest 
Nazarene’s Kristin Resfland hit Manuel for 
a double, putting the Crusaders up 1–0. 
Northwest Nazarene increased its lead in the 
third inning after loading the bases.

The Tritons recorded their first run of the 
game at the bottom of the third. Portugal, 
McQuaid and Romero found their way on 
base and Granath popped out to center 

field, advancing McQuaid home to score. 
The Crusaders’ Chelsea Anderson walked 
the Tritons’ next two batters to tie the score 
at 2–2.

Escamilla relieved Manuel at the top of the 
fourth and kept the Crusaders scoreless for 
the rest of the game. 

UCSD broke the draw in the sixth inning. 
Down two outs after their first two at-bats, 
the Tritons loaded the bases. With senior 
Annie Wethe on third, pinch running for 
senior Nicole Spangler, Romero doubled to 
left-center for three RBI.

GAME 3
FEB. 4

The third match of the series saw both 
starting pitchers face off against each other. 
Gaito seemed back in her usual form, record-
ing seven strikeouts while allowing just three 
hits in five innings.

The Tritons scored in their first at-bat, 

loading the bases and recording two unearned 
runs off of two wild pitches.

In the fourth inning, UCSD recorded just 
two hits but finished with five runs, capitaliz-
ing on two untimely Crusader errors. Up 7–0, 
the Tritons put the game out of reach as Gaito 
retired the next three batters in order.

GAME 4
FEB. 4

In the last match of the series, the Tritons 
converted eight of their 10 hits to sweep the 
Crusaders. Swanberg finished with three hits 
and two RBI, while Romero recorded two hits 
and three RBI. 

Hensel went the distance for the Tritons, 
allowing just one hit and recording her first 
win as a Triton. UCSD went up early, but put 
the game out of reach in the fifth inning, end-
ing with five runs on four hits.

make the cut for runs per game.
The only area for which UCSD was nationally 

ranked was its earned run average — almost completely 
attributable to Gaito’s 0.75 ERA. 

Obviously, with a pitcher as good as the junior, the 
Tritons would have always been in contention. And 
after last season, I just left it to that.

Even Gerckens herself couldn’t explain it, spluttering 
out something about magic and team chemistry and 
timing. But after some probing I started to think 
otherwise. It’s no secret that the Tritons aren’t below 
playing small ball. Whenever graduated senior Katrin 
Gabriel got up to bat, if the opposing third baseman 
didn’t sneak in towards home, she would most certainly 
find a bunt and make her way round the bases. 

At the time it just seemed like insurance.
“Speed doesn’t have slumps,” Gerckens said in 

defense of small ball. But Gerckens seems to think that 
speed is good for more than just squeezing out a couple 
extra runs. 

“If we can get the defense thinking about the runner 
on base, that means that the catcher will be thinking 
about them stealing, which means that some of her 
emphasis is going to be taken away from the pitch call,” 
Gerckens said. “And the pitcher may be worried about 
people taking off. Our goal is to confuse them and 
make them think about us. And when you can force 
errors, it really can bring a team down.”

Those are a few major assumptions. But Gerckens 
might have the secret: errors. 

In the Tritons’ 2011 national championship season, 
UCSD’s opponents collectively committed 82 errors 
in 58 games, for 1.41 errors committed per game. 
Looking at the CCAA statistics for 2011, no team in the 
conference comes close to the 1.41 error mark other 
than Sonoma State, whose 62 errors in 60 games puts 
them at 1.29 errors per game.

The trend seems to have continued into the college 
world series, where three of the Tritons’ four opponents 
committed errors well above their season averages. In 
their third match, Minnesota State Mankato’s one error 
— just higher than their 0.84 average — proved crucial 
towards the Tritons’ 4–2 win. 

More telling is first-round matchup C.W. Post’s 
seven errors, well above its 1.28 average. The Tritons 
capitalized to take the game 7–0. Numbers don’t lie, 
but they can also make nothing seem like something — 
and I will be interested to see if Gerckens’ theory holds 
up later into 2012.

GAME 1
FEB. 3

Junior designated hitter Richard Seigel 
went two for three with an RBI to lead the 
Triton offense as it fumbled to find momen-
tum in its loss on Friday.

Senior pitcher Jeff Raugh kept the Tritons 
in the game, only giving up two hits and one 
run on one error. But when he was pulled 
after six innings, the Tritons went through 
five pitchers who gave up seven hits and 
seven runs in three innings. 

The Tritons took the lead 1–0 in the bot-
tom of the fourth with one out. Sophomore 
Justin Rahn reached first on a fielding error. 

Sophomore centerfielder Nick LaFace was 
then hit by a pitch to move Rahn to second, 
from where he was hit in by Seigel for the 
Triton’s only run of the night. In the top of the 
seventh the Wolves scored two runs off two 
hits and a Triton error. They sealed the game 
with a five-run rally.

GAME 1
FEB. 3

In their season opener, the No. 1 Tritons 
got an early lead against the Crusaders. In the 
bottom of the first inning, with junior Diane 
Imoto on second and sophomore Tess Granath 
on first, sophomore catcher Charly Swanberg 
hit a solid line drive down the left field line to 
bat Imoto into home.

Northwest Nazarene had no response in 
its next at-bat, but the Tritons tacked on two 
more in the bottom of the second inning off of 
consecutive in-field errors.

The score remained 2–0 until the fourth 
inning when the Crusaders hit senior pitcher 

Camile Gaito for five runs. With two men on 
base, pitcher Cara Duckworth singled for one 
RBI. Gaito managed to strike out the next bat-
ter, but walked the next man up to tie the score.

Designated hitter Brianna Kinghorn 
struck a double to put the Crusaders up 4–2. 
Northwest Nazarene picked up one last run to 
end the inning.

Down 5–2, the Tritons rallied in the fifth 
inning. Both freshman second baseman 
Monique Portugal and junior Emily McQuaid 
singled to get on base. Portugal advanced 
home off consecutive infield errors, while 
McQuaid was brought home by consecutive 
sacrifice bunts.

With two outs, designated hitter Jennifer 
Manuel doubled to center field for two RBI.

Gaito finished out the sixth inning and was 

After 20 years at UCSD, softball head 
coach Patti Gerckens may be onto something. 
In 2011, after missing out on the conference 
championships, UCSD went undefeated 
at the college world series, winning the 
championship game by a remarkable (if not 
uncanny) seven-run margin.

In our coverage of the Tritons’ 
championship run, I threw around a couple 

ideas with the sports staff as to how a team 
ranked 15 spots under the national favorites 
could so dominate the series. Not to say, we 
were incredulous. But I don’t think many 
people would have put odds on a team that 
was ranked 15 spots under No. 1 Alabama-
Huntsville — a school with a long-standing 
history of strong softball squads.

You could maybe attribute one win to 
luck, the building of momentum, or the 5’4” 
Camille Gaito catching a team by surprise. 
Still, it doesn’t add up. UCSD wasn’t even in 
the top 50 teams for batting average, nor did it

UCSD Fall to 0-3 Against Point Loma

BY RACHEL UDA
Sports Editor

The No. 17 UCSD Women’s Tennis team 
has yet to find a win in the 2012 season. In 
the Tritons’ home opener against No. 11 Point 
Loma University last Monday, Feb. 6, UCSD 
fell 7–2.

UCSD’s top doubles team — Triton juniors 
Jacquelyn Davis and Melissa Breisacher — 
dropped to Point Loma’s Maika Adair and 
Sharon Reibstein. 

Davis and Breisacher looked poised from 
the start. Breisacher’s strong serve over-
whelmed Adair and Reibstein from the start, 
but the Point Loma pair was clearly better 
down the stretch. The two counter-punchers 
slowly took the lead in both sets, winning the 
match 8–6.

UCSD’s second doubles team of Melinda 
Chu and Tara Vanooteghem took a disap-
pointing 8–2 loss against Point Loma’s Jessica 
Kwan and Kiersten Steinhauer, though UCSD’s 
third pair of Katie Mulloy and Laura Wilke 
picked up an 8–4 win against the Sea Lions’ 
Wileen Chiu and Samantaha Mohr.

Down two games to one, the Tritons were 
unable to bounce back in the singles compo-
nent of the competition. 

The No. 1 singles match featured UCSD’s 
Breisacher and the Sea Lions’ Adair. The 
match was close, but again, Adair wore down 
Breisacher, ultimately taking a 7–5, 7–6 win. 
UCSD fell in the rest of their singles matches, 
with the exception of Davis’ contest with 
Steinhauer. The Houston native took the com-
petition in three sets, winning the first 7–5 
and dropping 3–6 before taking the last match 
6–3.

“Even though we lost, I am encouraged 

with the team’s improvement, especially in 
singles,” UCSD head coach Liz LaPlante said. 
“We have some work to do in doubles and 
after we settle on which teams work the best, 
we will improve with each match.”

 The 7–2 loss drops the Tritons to 
0–3 this season. UCSD will compete next in 

the Arizona Invitational on Feb. 10 to Feb. 12, 
where the Tritons will look for a win against 
Division-II opposition — Dominican College, 
Grand Canyon University and the Academy of 
Art.
