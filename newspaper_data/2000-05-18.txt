of the main opposition television

46th anniversary of the landmark 
Brown vs. Board of Education deci-

saying that the disparities between 
California's best and worst public 
schools are so great as to violate 
the state constitution's guarantee 
of a free and equal public educa-

the state assure that all schools

Maya Angelou will have 
knee surgery June 13 and 
will not speak at UCSD 
By VINCENT GRAQNANI 
News Editor 

Chancellor Dynes canceled this year's 
all-campus commencement Tuesday after 
Maya Angelou said she would be unable to 
speak at graduation. 

Angelou told UCSD officials earlier 
this week that she will have double knee 
surgery June 13 and that she regretted 
having to cancel the commencemenr 
address, which was scheduled to be held 
June 17. 

"We are deeply disappointed, in part 
because hopes had been raised so high by 
the prospect of Maya's appearance; said Jim 
Langley, vice chancellor of development and 
university relations. 

Chancellor Dynes said he considered 
the pos ibility of ecuring another speaker 
but concluded that not enough time 
remained. 

Langley agreed. 
. · We felt that a month was not ample 

time; Langley said. "There was no room for 
margin of error: 

Langley said that while he understands 
students may be disappointed. many do not 
realize how complicated the process of 
securing a speaker can be. 

"[ think it disappointed a significant 
number of students; he. 'said. "Perhaps 
many wish there was a substitute, but I 
would say to those people that there is a 
significant amount of work that needs to go 
on behind the scenes when securing a

UCSD will participate in San 
Diego's 10th annual Regional

mitment to community and 
healthy lifestyles for its residents,

location for hosting the event

the model for other big cities in 
California. such as L.A. and San 
Franqsoo,· 41tz said. "We have 

the best weather and are ideal for 
this sort of thing: 

As part of California Bike

is expected to attract over 4,000 
participants citywide. Additionally,

commuting. decreasing traffic and 
improving air quality.

around San Diego county, includ-
ing one at UCSD. 

Each pit stop will pro~ide 
cyclists with free food and gifts,

proposed the names of five people 
who were available to speak June 17 
and that they asked for 72 hours to 
try to secure one of the speakers. 

Khullar said that while he was 
disappointed that Dynes chose to 
c.ancel the ceremony, he under-
stand that time is running out to 
secure a new speaker. 

"I respect his decision," Khullar 
said. "Unfortunately, as a graduat-
ing senior I'm disappointed. It's 
just a very unfonunate situation as 
a whole." 

Mantell said that he too was 
disappointed with the situation. 

"I'm disappointed that we're not 
going to have an all-campus com-
mencement because a .lot of us 
worked hard for it throughout the 
year," he said. "I think that a lot of 
this is out of our control."

Langley said the chancellor was

campus unity but added that the

themselves in favor of the Second

A few people from the Million 
Mom· March and other gun con-
trol supporters drifted over to the 
SAS rally. Margorie - who 
declined to give her last name -
wondered how the people at the 
rally could think the way that they 
did. 

"I feel nauseated by this: 
Margorie said. "Especially when I 
see little chi ldren getting into it. 
That's what they're going to grow 
up to be like, too. I don't think that 
the people are thinking clearly. 

The UCSD Guardian 

pleased to see the money go toward 
O.A.S.I.S., or some other student-
related agenda. 

Langley said this year's experi-
ence can teach the campus com-
mUl1ity a lesson about planning the 
ceremony in future years. 

He suggested that the campus 
look for someone with closer ties 
to UCSD who could offer personal 
messages instead of a speech that 
has already been given several 
times. He said that it may be best to 
find someone who does not charge 
money to speak. 

·If we are going to pay for a com-
mencement speaker, we are going to 
be viewed as simply another date on 
their calendar," he said. 

He suggested that students 
and administrators meet soon to 
discuss next year's commence-
ment and come up with a new 
plan for the ceremony that does 
not revolve around a celebrity 
speaker. 

Seven separate coll~ge com-
mencements will be held June 17 
and 18 for IRIPS graduates, Ph .D 
recipients and students from the 
five undergraduate colleges. 

These people forget that you can't 
shoot somebody dead if there isn't 
a gun there." 

Holding signs, American flags 
and chanting "No Gun Control" 
and "Guns Save Lives,ff the crowd 
marched toward the area of the 
Million Mom March. 

At 7th Street and Constitution 
Avenue .W, the epicenter of the 
Million Mom March, the anti-gun 
control group was greeted by a 
chorus of boos and shouts from 
both sides of the street. Supponers 
of each group met at the sidewalks 
in some places, screaming about 
which side was right.

TA Settlement Will 
Benefit All 

The UCSD Guardian is pleased that the 
University of California and the teaching 
assistants ' union have reached a tentative 
contract agreement. 

This marks the end of th TAs' 17-year 
campaign for a contract. During this time, 
students have been greatly affected by 
strikes and the threat of strik s. It now 
appears that this tactic has paid off for the 
TAs. 

The new contract contains increased 
benefits for TAs, including a 9.S-percent 
salary increase over the next two years and 
full fee remission by fall 2002. 

In addition, the deal includes an agree-
ment by the union not to strike for the 
duration of the contract. 

The Guardian believes these points are 
beneficial to both parties, as well as to th 
UCSD student body. 

As students, we get a large portion of 
our education from TAs. It is therefore in 
our best interest for them to be paid well 
for their hard work. Their working condi-
tions are our learning conditions. 

We are also pleased to see a provision in 
the contract stating that TAs will not 
strike for the duration of the contract. The 
threat of strikes in the past has often put 
undo stress on students dealing with final 
exams. Professors are often uncertain as to 
how papers and exams will be graded in 
the event of a strike, causing turmoil for 
students. If this contract is ratified, stu-
dents can rest assured, knowing that 
another strike will not occur as long as the 
contract is in effect. 

We also hope that the university keeps 
its word and formally ratifies the con-
tract . 

The Guardian is pleased to see that the 
struggle for a contract has ended. In addi-
tion, in future years we hope that the 
process of negotiating between TAs and 
the administration will run more smooth-
ly and not harm students.

Market Pressures Force News to be 
Entertaining Rather Than Informative 
Important news stories drown amidst a tidal wave of sensationalism designed to 
attract an audience and keep consumers coming back for their next fix 
Senior Staff Writer 

Last week. the Russian duma ratified 
the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty. 
Even as the number of countries that 
have ratified the treaty increases. the 
U.S. Senate has already rejected it. This 
rejection might have important conse-
quences in the international arena, 
especially now that the Pax Americana. 
which only 10 years a~o seemed perma-
nently established. IS questioned or 
rejected by more and more countries 
who see America unwilling to responsi-
bly exercise its role as the world 's sole 
superpower. 

The recent instability of the New York 
Stock Exchange, which had global reper-
cussions. created fears that the long sea-
son of America's booming economy 
might draw to a close, and reopened the 
question of how we, as a society. have 
used these booming years. 

It also rekindled the criticism that, 
instead of spreading wealth among as 
many people as possible. we have cut 
social spending and concentrated 
money in fewer hands. The strike of jan-
itors in Los Angeles and San Diego, 
fighting for a SO-cent hourly increase 
and minimal health benefits. can be 
seen as a symbol of how economic 
growth has increased. rather than 
diminished. social disparity. 

The international mission to main-
tain peace and establish order in Kosovo 
is badly underfunded. After spending bil-
lions of dollars to bomb Kosovo. it is now 
impossible to find a few million dollars to 
rebui ld the political structure of the 
country, • 

These are only a few of the many 
intertwined threads that have crossed 
the national and international scene in 
the last weeks. The average American 
viewer. however. is quite unlikely to 
have heard much about these issues. 

Whatever one thinks of the 
plight of [Elitin Gonzalez], 
all have to admit that each 
day the international 
mission in Kosovo goes 
underfunded will generate a 

kvelofhumansujJ~ng 
several orders of magnitude 
greater. 
On the other hand. it is quite likely 
(and almost unavoidable) that the aver-
age viewer has heard a lot about one 
Elian Gonzalez. his father Juan and 
their Miami relatives. 

The media circus, with its many 
jesters and buffoons, has hovered over 
this story for more time than even the 
minimal restraint of the Jerry Springer 
era would allow. I will not dignify such 
a circus by expressing my opinion on 
the case. My opinion (and I do have 
one) will stay with me. What interests 
me is not ,the Gonzalez story, but the 
fact that it is a story or, better, that it 
has been fabricated into a news story. 

Whatever one thinks of the plight of 
the boy. all have to admit that each day 
the international mission in Kosovo goes 
underfunded will generate a level of 
human suffering several orders of mag-
nitude greater. Since it is impossible to 
report everything (and filtering is one of 
the most important functions of the 

. journalist). one would expect newspapers 
and 1V stations to filter news based on 
relevance, potential human impact and 
so on. 

This. unfortunately. does not seem to 
be the case. 

The story of Gonzalez. unfortunatelY 
for him and for us. had all the requisite 
elements that a media story should have 

in this day and age. For one thing. the 
protagonist was easily identifiable; he has 
a name and a face. The fundamentals of 
the case are rather simple, the alterna-
tives quite clear: Either the boy returns to 
Cuba with his father or stays with his 

. Miami relatives. The case was politically 
charged and was complex enough to give 
each day a few new minutiae to report. 
Everyone- could take a side and feel, 
rather strongly. that he was on the good 
side, while the opponents were obvious-
Iyevil. 

Compare this (hypothetically. of 
course) with a serious, in-depth analysis 
of American foreign policy toward Cuba. 
The problems here art rather complex 
and have many faces. The analyses are 
long and difficult and do not automati-
cally lead to an emotional response. Just 
thinking about it, I can hear the hypo-
thetical click of remote controls as 
American viewers switch to the WWF 
tOl,lrnament. 

The general scheme that one can see 
emerge by obselVing the news on most 

. media (especially on television. but 
newspapers are getting close) is that of a 
co~f1.uence between the world of reality 
as It IS reported to us, and that of fiction. 
as it is created by the same media. In 
other words, there is an effort to package 
and refer reality to the models and for-
mat of fiction . 

Action movies and the whole under-
culture of physical violence are obvious 
referents for police chases, school shoot-
ings and - in general - to the whole 
news media genre of crime and war. 
Kosovo was constantly in the news while 
it was bombed. though it has all but dis-
appeared from attention now that the 
issues are more complicated and funda-
mental. 

Lifetime movies and "movies of the 
week" furnish an anchor for human

UCSD'. Five College System Alienates Upperclassmen 
The five colleges on campus form an impurtant part of first and second-year students' lives, but after that they begin to lose relevance 
a,UVlN UID 
Senior Staff Writer 

Perhaps the most distinctive 
feature of UCSD is its five-college 
system. The arrangement was 
designed to combine the intimacy 
of a small college with the advan-
tages of a major research universi-
ty. The small-school environment 
provides a communal atmosphere 
and environment in which to live, 
thrive and grow. With the activi-
ties the colleges provide. students 
can easily develop friendships, 
build school spirit and play a 
more active role in college life. 

However, for many upperclass-
men living off campus, the sense 
of connection with their under-
graduate college has been lost. 
The five colleges seem less rele-
vant to them now than durin~ the 
one or two years they spent hving 
on campus, The connection exists 
only when one tries to deal with 
academic matters such as finish -
ing general education require-
ments and making endless trips to 
academic advising. 

In terms of college life and 
social activi ties. however, there are 
no significant incentives for 
upperclassmen to participate in 
thm college's activities. As a 
result. they develop an apathetic 
attitude toward their college that 
lasts until graduation. 

Once students move off cam-
pus. :he lines between the five 
colleges dissolve .. One starts inter-
acting with students from other 
colleges more. Upperclassmrn 
begin to study primarily with oth-

ers in their major. They set out to 
get more involved in clubs, athlet-
ics, sororities, fraternities and 
other organizations that are cam-
puswide rather than college ori-
ented. Life starts to resemble that 
of any other large university. 

Segregated living arrange-
ments and dining facilities no 
longer confine those who live off 
campus, There is a new commu-
nity and environment for them to 
live in and explore. It is easier for 
them to drive around the San 

natives . 
Even hanging out at their col-

lege during the day becomes more 
of a hllssle for upperclassmen. 
Many spend most of their days 
just going to class, working off 
campus and spending long hours 
commuting. Upperclassmen 
would rather eat and rest at the 
Price Center, the Student Center 
or the library because of these 
establishments' central locations 
on campus. 

It is true that there are com-

really attract them. The co.lI::ges 
should set up new organizations 
and activities in which their com-
muters would really be interested. 

The colleges must also reach 
out to commuters more and per-
suade them to participate. Only 
posting banners and flyers around 
the college areas is inadequate -
commuters generally never ven-
ture there. 

Instead. the colleges should 
mail flyers and send e-mails to 
inform their upperclassmen about 

Unolympics last September? If 
you exclude the resident advisors 
and the members of college coun-
cils. there probably was only a 
handful of upperclassmen. if any. 
The colleges would certainly have 
a better feeling of self-importance 
if more juniors and seniors partic-
ipated in their activities. 

If the colleges want to remain prominent in students' lives past the second 
year, they should do more to get commuters actively involved. The five schools 
must make an ejJort to talk to upperclassmen to find out what would really 
attract them. The colleges should set up new organizations and activities in 
which their commuters would really be interested. 

It is also quite ironic that the 
five colleges have fought the all -
campus commencement - they 
fear it will upstage the individual 
college ceremonies. The individ-
ual ceremonies are less significant 
to upperclassmen who have lost a 
sense of belonging to their col-
.Iege. After two years of having lit-
tle contact. the colleges suddenly 
force students into an awkward 
position. It is like separating from 
a spouse for two years without 
any communication. then being 
suddenly compelled to spend the 
day with him or her. Diego area, eat at different restau-

rants. and visit new places. They 
can smoke. drink or party at their 
residence without the {{'ar of a 
resident security officer breaking 
up their fun . 

Because there are more 
options fo r students living off 
campus. the colleges have a hard 
time trying to compete for these 
students' atten tion. For com-
muters. the costs of participating 
in college activities b gin to out-
weigh the benefits. Each college 
does have a student organization 
that plans events and actiVities ~ r 
commuters. but as upperclassmen 
t>ecome more involved in other 
things. the college commuter 
clubs do not offer attractive alter-

muters who feel a stronger con-
nection with their college and 
actively participate in the organi-
zations. programs and activities 
they provide. However. many 
upperclassmen are not interested 
in what is currently offered. 
Furthermore, the difficulty of 
finding parking close to their col-
lege may be a deterrent. even 
though students can park in A. B 
and metered spaces during 
evening hours. . 

If the colleges want to remain 
prominent in students' lives past 
the second year. they should do 
more to get commuters actively 
involved. The five schools must 
make an effort to talk to upper-
classmen to find out what would 

what is going on - some colleges 
already do this. Informed com-
muters are more likely to take part 
in the college events. The key. how-
ever. is to successfully convince 
commuters to actually participate. 

Otherwise. commuters will 
lose a sense of belonging to their 
college, They will become very 
apathetic and will not show any 
school spirit or unity I know all 
the colleges have a sense of pride. 
but the fact that upp rclassmen 
do not care about the colleges 
shows how flawed this perception 
has become. How many upper-
classmen participated in , Spirit 
Night? Do you remember how 
many juniors and seniors helped 
their college compete in the 

It IS no wonder many seniors 
prefer an all-campus commence-
ment. It i more relevant to them 
because they feel more of a con-
nection to the UCSD campus as a 
whole. 

About two-thirds of the stu-
dent population currently lives off 
campus. The challenge for the five 
colleges is to maintain the sense 
of Unity with these commuters. 
Otherwise. there is no point to 
having five colleges when they are 
only prominent for the first two 
years at UCSD. if for that long. 
The colleges should either be ig-
nificant for the enure time stu-
dents spend here. or not at all.

Celebrities Must Pay Price of Fame 
Some musicians misconstrue their right to privary as an excuse for reclusivity 
UCLA Daily Bruin 

(U-WlRE) LOS ANGELES -
We have all heard' the aphorism 
that says, "if you can't take the heat, 
get out of the kitchen." Well, appar-
ently all of us have, except for Fiona 
Apple. As much as I enjoy her 
music, her rebellious attitude and 
incredible voice, I have had a hard 
time listening to her music lately. 

Frankly, she has just gotten 
obnoxious. I know that as a good 
critic, I should be able to separate a 
person from her artwork, but 
whenever I hear any of her songs 
come on the radio, I stan reaching 
for the tuner knob. 

This is not meant to imply that 
deep down there is something 
wrong with Apple. For all I know, 
she is probably a really sweet per-
son; kind to her friends, friendly to 
strangers and full of all kinds of 
other good qualities. . 

As a public figure , however, 
he leaves much to be desired. 

Whenever she pops up in public, 
she is always throwing a tantrum 
of some sort. She continually 
complains that critics are the bane 
of her existence and that she 
should just be left to play in 
peace. 

Now, I only know this because I 
have read accounts in other news-
papers. So who knows? She may be 
right. Maybe it is all a vast conspir-
acy by the evil media out to get her. 
I doubt it, though . 

It seems to me that she has been 
the subject of a few bad reviews, 
and now she thinks she is some-
how exempt from criticism since 
she has a few hit songs- hence, 
her holier-than-thou attitude and 
acidic remarks to the media . 

Perhaps she thinks biting the 
hands that feed her will somehow 
advance her career. 

We all know it does not work 
that way. Try this in a class if you 
like: If a professor gives you a bad 
grade, tell him he is a moron, sit 
back and wait for the good grades 
to stan rolling in. Try it in all your 
classes, actually. You will find your-
self on the dean's list in no time 
flat. 

I am being a little unfair to 
Apple here, because she is by no 
means the only one who does this. 
I am just picking on her because 
she made a rather dramatic point at 
a recent concen that it would be a 
good show because there were no 
reviewers in the audience. 

The irony was that she made 
this remark with Roben Hilburn of 
the L.A. Tunes in attendance, so her 
linle coven remark was then sent 
out, accompanied with a nice color 
photo, to subscribers across the 
county. A critic reponing on this 
bit of anticritic sentiment struck 
me as a moment of wonderful 
irony. 

Apple is not alone thouSh. 
Adam Sandler, a pseudomusiCian 
and largely unfunny comedia~, 
docs the same thing, but in a dif-
ferent way. Rather than outwardly 
proclaiming his disdain for the 
media, he has simply withdrawn 
himself. 

He no longer does press junkets 
for his films. nor does he grant 
interviews to the media. People 
who work with him on his wildly 
successful films are similarly for-
bidden from speaking to the press 
about the newly minted recluse. 

Once again, this is someone 
who has been subject to a fair 
amount of negative criticism in 

years past. Maybe since Sandler has 
been panned so many times by 
cynical writers who had to sit 
through his movies and listen to 
his attempts to break into music, 
he has decided to remove himself. 

I could continue this rant at 
some length to cover the extremely 
long list of cntenainment personal-
ities who somehow consider them-
selves above all attempts at criti-
cism. That is a little self-indulgent, 
though. Just as it is my right as a 
writer to dislike them, it is their 
right as anists to not respect what I 
have to say. 

Rather than keep bagging on 
the people who cannot take com-
ments on their work, however, I am 
going to extend this dragnet of 
mine to all those celebrities who 
keep proclaiming how much they 
hate being famous. 

First, this is just straight-up 
dumb. I am sony, but there is no 
other way to say it. If an individual 
is a professional musician, one who 
records albums, goes on tour and 
appears on MTY, then he or she 
has already given up the "right" to 
obscurity. 

I am not saying that anyone has 
to accept paparazzi creeping 
around his or her bushes or crazed 
teenage fans breaking into one's 
house. Once an anist gets that 
record deal, however, he or she 
cannot use that tired old line, "I 
just want to make music." 

If these people really wanted to 
make music, they would get anoth-
er job and make music a hobby. It 
would be like Bill Clinton saying 
that he just wants to make policies 
and not have people analyze his 
life.

Fame: 
Celebrities must accept 
good press along with bad 

If anyone actively seeks the 
limelight, that person has to be 
ready to accept the consequences. 
So, when the boy band of the 
moment gets mobbed at a restau-
rant, tough luck for them. It would 
be nice if fans would be respectful, 
but the artist has to accept the 
downside of fame. 

Let's use everyone's favorite 
celebrity, Courtney Love, as an 
example. She has. been crammed 
down our throats for quite a while, 
first as the wife of Kurt Cobain, 
then as a trashy musician, then as a 
glamorous actress. 

Throughout the entire 
process, she has been a royal pain, 
continually whining about how 
unfairly she has been treated. In 
her defense, she has I eally had it 
tough in many ways - having 
your husband kill himself is a ter-
rible experience whether the 
whole world knows about it or 
not. Nonetheless, she runs off at 
the mouth far too much for her 
own good. 

I saw her in concert a few years 
back, and she went out of her way 
to tell the entire audience how 
much she loathed the photogra-
phers who were there covering the 
show, going so far as to order them 
to leave and intentionally standing 
away from them. 

Love, tough cookies. You did not 
seem to have a problem when every-
one was excited about your high-
fashion makeover, so do not get 
huffy just because someone takes an 
unflattering shot of you on stage. 

The same goes for you, Apple. 
When people called your debut 
album "brilliant,W you did not pitch 
a hissyfit. When things are not 
looking so sunny, however, no 
artist has the right to suddenly opt 
out of the media eye. 

It is one thing to want to keep 
your personal life private. I do not 
have: any problems with public fig-
ures who want to keep their ~Ia­
tionships to themselves. or those 
who do not want nonessential 
details put out there for all the 
world to see. 

When it comes to their roles as 
entertainers, however, these artists 
have to learn that they are not just 
~ar people anymore. I do not 
thmk they would want to be, either. 
Would Love want to go back to 
being just a regular lady with a bad 
job and a band that she played in 
on weekends? 

I doubt it. 
So in my parting words of infi-

nite wisdom, 1 will ~mind all those 
celebrities (since I am sure they all 
hungrily await my genius advice) 
that they got to where they a~ 
because of the public. 

The reporters who reviewed 
your work and the people who 
bought it are the ones to whom 
you owe your fame. Do not think 
you are somehow above us all, just 
because you $ot famous and we did 
not. So, cool It with the snootiness, 
and just go back to making music. 
That is why we liked you in the first 
place.

Daily Bruin 

(U-WIRE) LOS ANGELES 
- University of California 
union leaders say that stagnant 
wages mean tens of thousands 
of their workers are falling 
behind in the race to stay ahead 
of rising inflation rates and are 
losing ground in relation to 
other state workers. 

Citing a 6 percent average 
wage difference in comparison to 
other state employees in compa-
rable positions, members of 
University Professional and 
Technical Employees union 
along with the Communication 
Workers of America are asking 
the state legislature for an addi-
tional 2 percent budget allocation 
for non faculty salaries. 

Brad Hayward, a UC 
spokesman agreed, saying UC is 
in favor of a what the unions are 
asking for. 

"There are cases in which we 
know some groups of employees 

at the university are compensated 
less than comparable groups of 
employees in the local market: 
Hayward said. 

"We certainly support efforts 
in the legislature and by the gov-
ernor to provide salary increases 
to help liS address market lags 
that we have in some areas: he 
added. 

Hayward said allocations in . 
Gov. Gray Davis' budget revision, 
released Monday, would provide 
$12 million in staff compensation 
increases. 

Currently, 24 percent of the 
total funding for the UC system is 
provided by the state's General 
Fund. 

The university allocates an 
annual 2 percent cost of living 
adjustment to staff, but Fried said 
with inflation, employees need 
more. 

He pointed out that while the 
University of. California has 
focused on wage parity for faculty 
and administrntors, it has been 
neglecting staff. 

This year, UCSD's pit stop will 
be located in Parking Lot 510, 
near the corner of Gilman and 
Voigt drives. 

Over the years past four years, 
UCSD has consistently attracted 
over 300 cyclists to its campus pit 
stop. 

Coordinators of the event 
anticipate participation from 
UCSD's Pedal Club, a com-
muter program that rewards 
members who commute to 
UCSD by bike three or more 
days per week. Approximately 
1,000 members are registered in 
the program. 

According to Lutz, Bike to 
Work Day is more than an 
endorsement for bicycling as a 
healthy alternative to driving. 

"It's a promotion for people to 
try biking, but it's also a way for 
us to recognize those who have 
already been biking, like Pedal 
Club members, and to let those 
interested know that there are 
i~centives: Lutz said. 

"[Registered participants) 
have reported that they contin-
ue biking to work after partici-
pating for the first time: he 
said. "This is just one small way 
people can make a commitment 
in their personal lives to help 
solve the environmental and 
parking probl~ms we have at 
UCSD: 

According to the San Diego 
Regional Bike to Work Day regis-
tration form, 30 percent of people 
who tried commuting by bike for 
the first time last year continue to 
ride today. 

Copies of the San Diego 
Regional Bike map, which fea-
tures over 500 miles of bike 
routes and facilities, are available 
from Ridel ink at 1-800-COM-
MUTE.

Zapatlsta: 
Event contained musical 
performances and speeches 
ContInued rro. ..... 1 
olurion of love. 

Throughout the day, several 
people performed and spoke in 
support of the movement, includ-
ing a reporter from the Starlight 
Newspaper, a publication dedicated 
to homeless issues. 

Lory Tatoulian, a monologue 
artist, performed her piece 
"Beautiful Armenian Girl. H Los 
Vicerales, a percussionist band 
from Tijuana, also performed for 
the crowd. 

"We use music, poetry and pic-
tures to promote awareness on 
campus about the Zapatista strug-
gle: said Muir senior Adriana 
Guajardo, one of the coordinators 
of the event. "We realize that it is 
really easy for students here to get 
alienated from what happens in the 
rest of the world, and the Zapatista 
struggle is something that is going 
on right next to us in Mexico, that 
we as U.S. citizens should be con-
cerned about: 

Members of Z.A.G. said the 
Zapatista movement has been taking 
place in Chiapas. Mexico, where the 
government has been suppressing 
the indigenous people - mostly of 
Mayan descent - of this poorest 
and southernmost state. [t has been 
hailed by many as the first resistance 
movement of the new global society, 
according to Z.A.G. members. The 
demonstrators have protested the 
economic policies of the West by 
establishing roadblocks in Chiapas, 
calling press conferences and send-
ing out press releases. 

Also present at the event were 
representatives from the Comminee 
for Solidarity in the Americas, a local 
organization composed of voluntary 
activists who work to create connec-
tions between the people of Tijuana • 
and San Diego. 

The Committee for Solidarity in 
the Americas promotes awareness 
about U.S. involvement in the perse-
cution of the indigenous people of 
Chiapas. [t asserts that the U.S. ~ov­
ernment has supported MeXican 
control of Chiapas for many years. 

"We can't ignore the fact that 
the U.S. government finances a lot 
of the weapons that the Mexican 
government uses to repress and kill 
the indigenous people of Mexico 
just because these people are 
demanding justice, liberty and 
democracy: Guajardo said. 

Graduate student Guillerlllo 
Ariles-Rodriguez spoke about the 
importance of increasing student 
involvement in the Zapatista 
movement. 

"Social and political awareness is 
almost nonexistent on this campus: 
Ariles-Rodriguez said. "We hope to 
promote F· 'litical and social aware-
ness to students on the UCSD cam-
pus through the employment of per-
forming arts as well as through the 
use of alternative media." 

Roosevelt junior Odette Orozco 
spent two weeks in Chiapas as an 
international observer. She said 
that while she was there, she saw 
military raids against indigenous 
people at least 30 times a day. 

"[ learned that if people from 
around the world were to go to 
this indigenoliS community as 
observers and show support for 
the Zapatista movement, the 
Mexican government is less. likely 
to invade the community," 
Orozco said. 

Although Z.A. G. currently has 
approximately 20 members, the 
participants are determined to 
increase student involvement. 

Graduate studellt Robert Herr, 
who is also a member of the 
Committee for Solidarity in the 
Americas, discussed human rights 
violations in Latin America and the 
role of the U.S. government in the 
enactment of these violations. 

"There is a whole other world O'lt 
there: Herr stated. "These countries 
have troubling social and economic 
problems that we as students and cit-
izens should be concerned about."

The Guardian explores Sun God 2000's weak nighttime concert lineup 
ay JOIIPH UI 
Staff W,it", 

That's right, kids - it is indeed 
that time of ,ear again. Time for 
thousands 0 UCSD students to 
find ways to sneak kegs into the 
dorms. Time for the beer drinking 
to start midday (or midweek) and 
then continue long into the night. 
Time for those raging Sun God 
parties, where the halls smell like a 
strange blend of cigarette smoke 
and something grotesquely 

· other.~ Time to see the pizza 
delivery guys work hard for their 
money. The time to pay homage to 
the Sun God has returned. 

The Sun God festival originally 
started as a daytime festival, but 
the insertion of an evening concert 
in 1985 rmde Sun God what it is 
today. In 1985, Los Lobos enter-
tained the masses. In 1992, Blur 
came to UCSD. The next year, 
Blues 1hlvcler and Gin Blossoms 
came to perform. No Doubt in 
1994, 311 in 1995, and Rocket 
from the Crypt was here at Sun 
God in 1996. 

By the way, who is coming to 
Sun God 2000? 

Umm .... not sure, eh? 
Well, the star-studded lineup 

for Sun God 2000 is Dishwalla, 
Rahzel from The Roots, The Aqua-
bats and local band F.o,N, 

Hey, I thought Naughty by 
Nature was supposed to come.? 
Nope. Sorry. They backed out, and 
so did Run-DMC. 

Well, the lineup is still kind of 
cool. I guess. Let's see what we 
have on our hands. 

Dishwalla was formed in 1992 
and is fronted by JR. Richards and 
bacUd by bassist Scot Alcxander, 
guitarist Rodney Browning and 
drummer George Pendergast. Jim 
Wood was added as the key-
boardist a few years later. Dishwal-
la's debut album Pet Your Friends 

yielded "Counting Blue Cars: 
which was Billboard's Rock Song 
of the Year in 1996. 

Since then, Dishwalla released 
And You Think You K1IQW What Lift's 
About in the summer of 1998 with 
little fanfare. Dishwalla has toured 
extensively and they have enter-
tained crowds with their catchy 
choruses and pop hooks that are 
layered over a solid rock guitar 
sound, but can they headline a fes.-
tival with thousands of people in 
attendance? We shall see. 

However, fans can count on 
Rahzel from The Roots to spice 
things up and keep the show lively. 
His funky jazz sound will be fresh 
and exciting. Not to mention the 
fact that Rahzel is a master of 
vocals. He has been described as a 
vocal percussionist, a vocal acrobat 
and a human beat box. This self-
proclaimed "Godfather of Noyze ~ 
is sure to keep the crowd mesmer-
ized and energized for, ahem, 
Dishwalla. 

How can you forget our favorite 
new wave, ska-punk band, The 
Aquabats? Their affinity for the 
1960s Batman series has led to 
their zany costumes and imper-
sonations of various Batman vil-
lains. Vocalist Christian Jacobs 
fronts the band, which has at least 
eight other members. The Aqua-
bats' most recent effort, The Aquo-
bats vs. The Floating Eye 0 is certain 
to bring their happy sounds of 
syncopated guitar upstrokes and 
bright horns in order to keep 
things upbeat . 

Local band F.o,N, won the Bat-
tle of the Bands at the RIMAC all-
nighter and thus will be opening 
the concert. 

The DJs and Vinylphiles Club 
will keep the crowd pumped up by 
spinning music between sets. 

So, there we g<r- the evening 
concert lineup for Sun God 2000. 
Dishw.lla is a one-hit wonder 

• 

COtIt~ of MCA Records 
liioi: Not five Roots, but ~ Sun God 2000 wiU ftature Rahzel (above right) and his lXXal upertise from The Roots. 
band, but could prove to come up 
solid. Rahzel is very talented and 
should put on a fantastic set. The 
Aquabats should be amusing and 
it will be great to experience 
F.o.N.'s local feel. 

However, it still seems as if Sun 
God 2000 lacks that solid headlin-
:r that will ma~e everyone want to 
rush to the show. Sun God's pop-
ularity has never revolved around 
"goodW bands, just popular ones. 

Perhaps we will be pleasantly sur-
prised by the musical perfor-
mances, which, at the very least, 
will provide something to do for 
free on a Friday night.

Interoiew with circus performer proves it's never too late change direction in life 
IyILONAFMI 
Senior Staff Writer 

In a recent telephone interview 
from a small Indiana hotel near 
where The Big Apple Circus Stage 
Show was touring. Justin Case, Big 
Apple Circus performer and native 
Australian, explained how his quest 
to admire someone else's work led 
him to discover his own artistic tal-
ent. 

Prior to his circus career, Case 
studied art. Like many students 
tired of bad textbook pictures, he 
planned a trip throughout Europe 
to see the masterpieces in person. 

On his way out of a museum in 
Spain, something clicked when he 
crossed paths with a juggler, realiz-
ing that he wanted to expand his 
artistic horizons beyond the two-
dimensional world of paintings and 
print-making. 

Case sees the circus as a 
metaphor for life, a place 
where everything can and 
will go wrong, Besides a 
microcosmic demonstration 
for how we cope with 
problems, the big top is 
the perfect venue to watch 
the flexing not onry of 
limbs arul imagirui.lum, 
but oj humor as weU. 

A longtime fan of motorcycles 
and bicycles, Case moved on from 
juggling to bicycling and took on 
his specialty for a comedic bicycle 
act in The Big Apple Circus Stage 
Show, which is about the hilarious 
mayhem that ensues when a pro-
fessional acting company and a 
one-ring circus are slated to per-
form simultaneously on the same 
stage. The scheduling imbroglio 
results in a comicat, anistic tug-of-
war as the performers duke it out, 
matched in talent and wit. 

This is Case's first time in 
America, which he admits is very 
different from its portrayal on tele-
vision. Like most performers on 
the road for months at a time, one 
of Case's biggest challenges is eat-
ing well. According to Case, ham-
burgers and chips do not cut it. To 
ensure the intake of sufficient 
nutrients with his meals. Case 
brings along his juicer and mixer. 

Inspired by Charlie: Chaplin 
and Buster Keaton, Case relies 
on his comedic sltills as much as 

Moving from the realm of the 
dark room to the big top was no 
easy feat for Case. He practiced his 
craft about six hours a night, work-
ing in a photo lab during the day to 
make ends meet. Case trained in 

Australia with Chinese acrobat Lou 
Gong Wrong of Nanjing Acrobatic 
Troupe, then joined The Ecole 
Nationale de Cirque in Paris. spe-
cializing in acrobatics while taking 
clown workshops at the Ecole Sans 
Filet in Brussels. Case has per-
formed in Australia, Europe and 
Japan, appearing in several interna-
tional festivals where he won 
numerous awards. 5« c.cus, Page 21

Another look at what the Electra complex can do 
"""'LB Hiatus Editor 

The annual Sun God festival is 
by far UCSD's biggest event of the 
year, a 24-hour party with free 
bands, carnival-style booths spon-
sored by every campus organization 
and an enornlOUS amount of energy 
that can be best identified as genuine 
"spirit: 

In pastlears. a simple wink or 
smile coul be the right password 
for a free jell-O shot in anyone of 
the many booths. Numerous veteran 
professors expect a large portion of 
their classes to be missing or not in 
the right frame of mind. Verily, it is 
this "frame" that might be the single 
greatest connection between all stu-
dents during Sun God. 

Whether one is high on life or 
simply high, Sun God is notorious 
for setting an easy-going attitude 
throughout campus. However, this 
attitude might be compromised with 
this year's band selection. 

The true popularity of Sun God 
has always revolved around its 
nighttime concert lineup. Last year, 
Cypress Hill got insane in the mem-
brane with UCSD, while Social Dis-
tortion and the Roots belted out 
memorable perfomlances the year 
before. 

This year, Dishwalla is headlining 
the concert with the Aquabats, 
Ramel from The Roots and F.o.N. 
opening for them. This is not a good 
sign for the future of UCSD's free 
events. Here are some general con-
cerns about this year's concert. 

First, their name sounds familiar, 
but what do these guys sing? Dish-
walla is ultimately a one-h\t wonder 

COUftesy 01 c.tneMI«tr • . com 
....... -......: Carmen Ellrtra will be the celebrity guest for "7'M GJeib Show. H 
of a band that would not even have 
made the supporting cast of previ-
ous Sun God concerts. 

Second, just one "Roo!"? What 
happened to the other five members 
of the group, not to mention that 
Ramel is what you call a "vocal per-
cussionist; a true beat boxer. What 

this also implies. however, is that the 
members who actually rap will not 
be there. A firestorm of beats might 
spill out of Rahzel's muse-coated 
throat, but getting one Root as 
opposed to the whole proverbial tree

marinating of all three bands 
emanates a disturbing imbalance, 
the same way in which mixing Pepsi

cial celebrity guest for this year's 
show. Past celebrity guests have 
included Dustin "Screech" Dia- L.....--_______ --.J 
mond from "Saved By the Bell" fame 
and M1V veejay Kennedy. 

When asked why Electra was 
chosen to be the show's guest. 
Gleibennan replied with enthusi-
asm. 

"Wr. wanted to get celebrities that 
would gather a huge collegr. audi-
ence and who also had a great stage 
presence," Gleiberman said. "She 
was fifth on our wish list of possible 
guests. but after some consideration, 
the wholr. staff agreed that she was 
actually the No. 1 choice for this 
show with her incredible presence. ~ 

Wish list alternatives included 
Katie Holmes and Sarah Michelle 
Gellar. However, Glelbennan was 
qUIck to inject, "Even though we 
didn'l get Holmes or Gellar, I think 
Carmen Electra gives just as strong, 
if not stronger, incentive for people 
to come see the Gleib show live." 

"The Gleib Show" started in 
1997 and has progressively grown 
into a comedylvariety show, filled 
with sketches and movie spoofs 
such as "jewish Maguire," "Titanic 
2" and "UC Swingers." The finale 
will also have a final mini-movie 
entitled, "American Booty; a spoof 
on this year's best picture winner 
where a sixth-year student falls in 
love with a freshman. 

If thr. show's cinematic antics do 
not float your boat, then the 15-
minute interview with Electra might 
be enough incentive to see where fife 
has led Dennis Rodman's ex-wife. 
Apparently, there is life after "Bay-
watch.· Gleiberman also promises 
that thr. show wiU have a special 
"something" in store for all those 
who watch the interview, although, 
the hosl was reluctant to divulge his 
secret. 

Aside from spoofs and silicone, 
"The Gleib Show" will also feature a 
nationally known comedian, a hid-
den camera segment and the show's 
very own house band Greensboro 
Ln . Last year was marked by 
Gleiberman's entrance in a Marine 
Corps. tank, and the host has 
promised to keep the utradition" 
alive this year. 

Gleiberman has done what this 
year's Sun God nighttime concert 
has failed to do - capture the audi-
ence. Sun God's equation for suc-
cess has always been a simple one by 
featuring a strong headlining act. 
Quite frankly, Dishwalla is a poor 
choice to give main stage to. Ramel 
wou Id have been a better choice to 
headline or even the Aquabats, as 
both parties carry strong audiences 
and assure a hefty number of stu-
dents to stay for the whole concert. 
The audience will probably groove 
more to the in-between spinning of

Electra: 
Dishwalla is not cut out 
to be a headlining act 

the DVC deejays than Dishwalla's 
act. 

Get a head stan on Sun God with 
the " The Gleib Show,· as it may 
prove to be this year's biggest attrac-
tion despite the enonnous amount 
of money given to fund these night-
time concens. 

Circus: 
Case discusses importance 
at comic relief 
his physical talent. His act 
requires an enormous amount of 
concentration and skill. but 
entertaining the audience takes 
precedence. . 

"My number-one desire is to 
feel that I've touched the audi-
ence.· Case said. "My role is very 
much comic relief." 

Case sees the circus as a 
metaphor for life, a place where 
everything can and will go 
wrong. Besides being a micro-
cosmic demonstration for how 
we cope with problems, the big 
top is the perfect venue to watch 
the flexing not only of limbs and 
imagination. but of humor as 
well . 

Also, for those wondering what 
the real story is behind his name, 
Ca,se insists there is no story 
(although he is consideriqg 
changing his last name to Credi-
ble). He also said that oddly 
enough, most people are not 
aware of the pun when they hear 
his name. 

The Big Apple Circus Stage 
Show will be at the Civic Theatre 
in downtown San Diego, June 13-
18. 

For students staying in San 
Diego over the summer, check out 
Ragtime (Aug. 15· 20), Fosse Ouly 
11-16) and Cabaret (Aug. 1-6), the 
lanu of which are two of Broad-
way's most racy, sexy musicals to 
date. For more information or to

OUTDOOR SLAM-DUNK IASKmALL 

Nothing turns heads at a basketball tournament 
Irke a monster slam dunk and right behind that is a 
deep 3-po1nter. But at UCSD we're genereny a little 
short on high "yers or long bombers. Well. that's 
all 'gunna change on Saturday. Ifs time for eVIllY 
hoopohotic to have hislher day In the sun at this 
event that has been the comerstone of the festival 
for years. 

I! you ever wondered what ~ would feel Nke to 
be like Vince soaring through the air for another 
jam, this Is your tournament. We've got the courts 
set-up so even the most ground-bound Tmons can 
go off. And. don1 worry we've got plenty 0/ first aid 
for those rim shots to the heed. 

I! firing 'em up from long range is your spe-
cialty you will feast on the 3-poinI Una that has been 

~ed In to 17 feet. Ifs just about a layup and 
worth twice as much as a regular bucket. Bombs 
away! 

The rawn of our construction work IS a tun filled 
day olleeling like a superstar on the basketball 
courts under the beautiful San Diego sun. MUSIC. 
pozes and refreshments will accompany all the 
action. Think of the trash-talk you can secure by 
hammering home a thunder dunk on somebody 

who said you couldn't jump (even though they 
were probably right). 

As if all that wasn't enough. the real feature of 
the day is the SLAM DUNK CONTEST. This will

Track and Field Not 
Intimidated by Foes 
Even though they were the only Division III school 
present, UCSD men and women both finish fifth 
By ROBERT FULTON 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD track and field squad 
went to play with the big boys this 
weekend at the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association 
Champions;lips. held at UC Davis. 

"I'm just really pleased with how 
our people stepped up; said Thton 
Head Coach Tony Salerno. "There's 
nothing about our performance that 
would tell anyone that we're a 
Division III program. Virtually every-
one we have put in a strong perfor-
mance and we're a legitimate threat 
to everyone: 

The men's and women's teams 
each held their own. 

The women placed fifth out of 11 
schools with 92 points. and the men 
also finished fifth with 71.5 points. 
competing against nine schools. 

The women's 4x4oo relay gar-
nered third place with a time of 
3:55.84 ;md qualified for nationals 
with a season best performance. 

Jessica Shugart played Flash this 
weekend, docking a time of 25 .53 
for fourth in the 200-meter dash and 
a time of 12.56 in the 100-meter 
event, giving her fifth place. She also 
commanded the anchor leg on both 
relay teams. 

Nicole Rodriguez got in on the 
action, completing a national quali-
fying time of 63.15 to finish in 
(ourth place in the 400 hurdles. 

Maggie Dwire tossed in a season 
best in the 800 meter with a time of 
2:17.41 for fifth. 

[n field events. the women had 
more highlights 

[n the triple jump, Lilian Liu fin-
ished fourth with a leap of 11.31 
meters, Anne Morre took seventh 
with an 11 .06 and Nicole johnson 
eighth after flying 10.98 meters. 

The UCSD Guardian Thursday. May 18, 2000 

The women had an excellent clay. 
Freshman Carolyn Jones burned 

up the track, taking first in the 3000-
meter race in a school record of 
9:50.53. She also grabbed third in 
the 1500 meter in a time of 4:38.99.

Sun God: 
Weekend festivities will 
include plenty of drinking 
CGnIIMed ".. ..... 28 
get drunk if you get to campus so 
early?" Well to answer that [ have 
to relate a story. Sun God morn-
ing is kind of like Christmas 
morning around the Burger house 
when my sister and [ were 
younger. The first one who woke 
up would give the other one a 
Sign, (usually a stuffed animal by 
the door) telling the other that it 
was OK to go into their room 
when they woke up. 

Sun God is a lot like that, except 
whenever somebody in my apart-
ment wakes up, they run around 
and make sure everyone else gets 
up right then so the drinking can 
begin. 

Another thing that is exciting 
about Sun God is that everyone 
around campus is friendly and 
cheerful. Definitely more friendly 
and cheerful than usual. There is 
none of this "looking at the ground 
as you quickly scurry to class" ' 
garbage that usually happens. 
around this school. 

First of all , nobody is going to 
class. I think it is against the rules 
of the school to attend class on 
Sun God Friday. Second of all, 
everybody that is walking around 
is just as happy as you that it is 
Sun God. Because of this, every-
body is cheery and in a talkative 
mood. This mood is even more 
enhanced because everybody 
around you is inebriated in some 
fashion . 

Parties after the concert can 
sometimes be a sticky situation. 
The campus police really crack 
down hard on Sun God, so [ 
wouldn't suggest having a party if 
you live on campus. [ am sure that 
most of you will know somebody 
that is having people over after the 
concert, but just in case, in the. 
spirit of Sun God, [ am making this 
offer. 

Come by the Guardian office 
today or tomorrow and look at the 
white board on the left wall of the 
office. [ will leave directions to my 
place, which is just off campus, and 
everybody is invited to come by an 
hour after the concert ends. 

It just breaks my heart when [ 
hear people say that they don't 
have anything to do on a Friclay 
night, so at least this Friday you 
can:t say you didn't have any 
options.

lose is familiarity: Lanthier said. 
"You know how they're going to

"[ think we were certain ly hurt

When we lost those five seniors, 
that was hard for us to recover

for us: Lanthier continued . 
"Going from D III to D II, it's

we got nine seconds faster:

A Crash Course in 
Sun God Etiquette 
IyIlU.IUIl8III 

Sometimes, my friends and I sit 
around my apartment, sip beers 
and discuss whether we 'really 
belong at this school. 

There are times when we real-
ly don't seem to fit in. Sure we do 
our work and study for tests just 
like all of you guys, but we seem 
to crave entertainment way more 
than the average UCSD student 
does. Maybe the average student 
here is simply more diligent than 
I, or maybe being at this school 
for one, two, three or four years 
(or more for some of you) has 
simply curbed your drive to have a 
good time. 

o matter what it is that drives 
you into this world filled with ' 
books and calculators, put it in the 
closet this weekend, because Sun 
God has arrived. 

The majority of you will 
understand my excitement right 
away, but those of you who will be 
experiencing your first Sun God 
festival tomorrow may be a little 
confused about why this day is 
something that I have been 
counting down the days to ever 
since Halloween . Let me attempt 
to explain. 

First of all , and probably least 
importantly, the A.S. Council goes 
to great lengths to try and ensure 
an entertaining Friday of Sun God 
weekend. Everybody knows about 
the concert, but this concert is 
different than other concerts dur-
ing the year. The A.S. Council 
usually puts the concert on 
RIMAC field, where you could fit 
20,000 people if you wanted to, 
and people come out in hordes to 
see the entertainment. I am not 
even all that enthused about the 
bands this year, but you can bet 
that I will be there (at least physi-
cally) . 

There is also a carnival-like 
atmosphere on campus through-
out the day. Many organizations 
have booths on Library Walk where 
you can play games and win prizes. 
My personal favorite is still from 
my freshman year, when The 
Koala's booth was titled "Knock the 
Cock into the Box." 

There are also merchants from 
around town that set up booths 
where you can do anything from 
buy popcorn to get tattooed. These 
booths are surrounded by an 
inflated circus, where you can run 
through an intlatable obstacle 
course or box with inflatable 
gloves . 

Additionally, I have been told 
that there is an area where beer is 
given away to people of age. I have 
never been 21 for a Sun God festi-
val before, but now that I am, you 
can guarantee that I will be looking 
for this beer oasis that I have heard 
so much about. 

More important than the 
added scenery around campus is 
the attitude the Sun God festival 
brings with it. First of all, every-
body walking around campus is 
drunk or high or worse. This 
begins at about 9 a.m. and contin-
ues all the way until you can't 
stand up anymore (last year, that 
was midnight for me, but hopeful-
ly I can improve on that pitiful 
performance this year).

Rowing Team Hangs Tough 
Triton crew takes fifth place at Pac-l 0 Conference Championships, beats rival Sac State in heat 
By ROBIIIT PULTON 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD men's and 
women's crew teams had strong 
showings this weekend. 

The men strutted their stuff at 
the Pac-10 Conference Rowing 
Championships, and the women 
did well in the Pacific Coast 
Rowing Championships. 

The Pac-1 0 event is one of the 
toughest competitions around, 
comprised mainly of Division I 
schools. 

This did not affect UCSD. 
"The big thing for us is to be 

the premier (Western 
Intercollegiate Rowing 
Association] school: said UCSD 
Head Coach Michael Filippone. 
"Two out of the last three years, 
we've been No. 1," 

The Triton men grouped 
together to take fifth in the varsi-
ty eight final with a time of 
5:57.9. 

UCSD was thrilled by the 
fifth-place finish . The four 
schools ahead of the Tritons were 
all Division I rowing powerhous-
es - UC Berkeley, University of 
Washington, Oregon State 
University and Stanford 
University. , 

"The finals was the same exact 
lineup of the people who were 
racing two years ago in 1998.-
said senior crew member Paul 
Dodge. 

In addition to the varsity eight 
performance, UCSD had another 
highlight. 

Courtlt¥ UCSD Crew Tens 
....... The UCSD men's varsity eight emu sqwd. which ftnishtd fifth at the Poc-lO Confrrmce Rowing Championshrps, prrpam 
to launch before a raa this last wtnma. 

The men's novice eight won 
the petite final in a time of 
6:44.5 . 

"They'll have an impact com-
ing back next year: Filippone 
said. "They'll be hungry to make 
an impact on the varsity team." 

The weekend was made even 
sweeter by the Tritons' win over 
rival Sacramento State. 

Sacramento had recently bean 
on iI roll, including a victory at 

the Western Intercollegiate 
Championship last month. 

"The seeding got all screwed 
up, and we were in a really diffi-
cult heat against Sacramento 
State, but we saw the opportuni-
ty: Dodge said. "We lost by two 
seconds to Sac State last month. 
We were really pissed off. This 
was the continuation of their 
'Golden Year.' They were unde-
feated in our conference, and we 

had to race them." 
All of these accomplishments 

gave Sacramento State bragging 
rights, but UCSD took them 
away. 

In the varsity eight preliminary 
heats, Sacramento jumped out a 
full boat length ahead early on. 
UCSD battled back and the two 
schools were eventually going at it

Three Members of Bask~tball Team to Depart 
UCSD's men's busketball standouts Russ, McMillian and Almquist conclude their hoop careers 
By ROBIIIT FULTON 
Sports Editor 

Senior members of the men's 
basketball team will have to take 
their shot-stuffing skills and their 
fantastic shooting somewhere else 
next year. The call of graduation is 
in the air. 

Ahmad Russ and Michael 
McMillan have already graduated 
and Dan Almquist will be parting 
ways come June. 

"It's kind of interesting because 
all three of them had very different 
careers here; said UCSD Head 
Coach Greg Lanthier. 

Each player contributed some-
thing special to the squad. 

"I think the two things, from a 
basketball standpoint, that Ahmad 
brought was a nice shooting touch

we've had since I've been here; 
Lanthier said. "He was the leading 
rebounder per minute the two 
years he played, which was not 
surprising." 

McMillan fulfilled his duty as a 
role player with excellence. 

"Mike on the other hand did 
all of the little things that were 
necessary to be successful: 
Lanthier said. " I found when we 
were surrounded by better play-
CfS, Mike could be a cl1mplemen-
tary player." 

Almquist brought out the best 
in the team. 

"Dan was very inspirational.

each of the two years he played, 
which is evidence of how they 
viewed him." 

Different paths

stars to 
UCSD. 

Of the three 
players, 
McMillan is the only one 
who spent his entire carttr 
here.

Lanthier said Russ could have 
been much better had he started 
playing sooner.
