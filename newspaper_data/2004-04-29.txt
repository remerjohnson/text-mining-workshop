An estimated 1,000 college stu-
dents, faculty and supporters 
marched through downtown San 
Diego on April 26 in protest of 
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's 
proposed tuition hikes and budget 
cuts to higher education. 

About 70 UCSD students 
joined the rally, marching with par-
ticipants representing different 
colleges in San Diego County, 
including Grbssmont College, San 
Diego City College, San Diego 
State University, Mesa Community 
College, Southwestern College 
and California State U niversity

The UC Student Association's 
graduate and profes ional student 
committee released a report detail -
ing the "true cost" of education for 
graduate and professional .rodents 
on April 22 . 

If Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger's proposed budget 
cuts are implemented, graduate 
student fees will increase by 40 
percent and professional student 
fees will increase by 25 percent.

On the ftUII'Ch: Faculty and students from local colleges march to GeN. Arnold Schwarzenegger's San Diego office in protest 
of proposed cuts to higher education on April 26. The march was sponsored by the San Diego Stop the Cuts Coalition. 

"I think that there's a sentiment 
that students are not a political 
force, that we have no voice, and 
that we don't care," Benjamin 
Balthasar, a coordinator for the 
UCSD Coalition to Stop the Cuts, 
said. "The protest suggests that

. Atkinson shares stories 
behind S.A. T. reform 

By BRYAN BAO 
Associate News Editor 

Former UC president and 
UCSD chancellor Richard C. 
Atkinson spoke on his experi-
ences working to change the 
Scholastic Aptitude Test 1 exam 
at Mandeville Auditorium on 
April 28. Recounting the devel-
opment of the S.A.T. debate, 
Atkinson highlighted the impor-
tance of standardized testing in 
the American education system 
and shared many of the personal 
events that inspired him to seek a 
new method of standardized test-
ing. 

In addition to serving as UC 
president, Atkinson's support of 
achievement tests, such as the 
S.A.T. II, over aptitude tests 
helped to prompt significant 
changes in the S.A.T. 1. Atkinson 
also served as the chair of the 
National Academy of Sciences' 
Board on Testing and 
Assessment. 

Beginning in 2005, the 
SAT. 1 exam will feature a 25-
minute writing segment and a 
more advanced quantitative sec-
tion. 

"During his eight-year tenure 
as the president of the 
[University of California] ... he 
challenged this country's most 
widely used admissions examina-
tion - the SA T. I," said Center 
for the Humanities director

Outreach 
supporters 
mull new 
coalition 
By VLADIMIR KOGAN 

Senior Staff Writer 

On April 27, a day after students 
held statewide protests against cuts 
to higher-education funding, a 
group of students, staff and faculty 
members concerned with the elim-
ination of outreach programs met 
to discuss the organization of a new 
coalition. 

In addition to discussing the spec-
trum of the pre-coUegiate programs 
devoted to increasing access to high-
er education for students from 
impoverished or poor-performing 
districts and disseminating informa-
tion, attendees at the gathering 
reflected on the impact that outreach 
programs have had on their own 
lives. The event was sponsored by the 
Graduate Student Association. 

"We know that there are a large 
number of people on this campus 
- faculty, staff and students - who 
are concerned about outreach ... 
and what we wanted to do is bring 
these people into a forum, " 
Heather Flowe, GSA vice president 
of external relations and a sixth-
year psychology graduate student, 
said. Flowe organized the event.

Impagliazzo wins 
Guggenheim Fellowship 
Russell Impagliazzo, a UCSD computer sci-

ence and engineering professor, was awarded 
a Guggenheim Fellowship on April 8 in recog-
nition of his work on heuristics, proof complex-
ity and algorithmic techniques. 

Guggenheim fellowships are awarded to sci-
entists, artists and scholars in the United States 
and Canada. This year, the annual fellowships 
from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial 
Foundation totaled $6.9 million and were 
awarded to 185 out of over 3,200 applicants. 

Impagliazzo, who came to UCSD in 1989, 
specializes in computational complexity theory. 
His research indudes proof -:omplexity, com-
putational randomness, structural complexity 
and the theory and foundations of cryptogra-

safely use less randomness. 

Jane Goodall to be honored 
at Birch Aquarium 

Renowned primatologist Jane Goodall will 
be awarded the Nierenberg Prize for Science in 
the Public Interest during a ceremony at the 
Birch Aquarium on April 30. 

Goodall will be presented with a medal and 
$25,000. The ceremony, which will start at 
7:1 5 p.m. in front of the aquarium, will be fol-
lowed by "Reasons for Hope: a free public 
presentation and a book sisning with Goodall. 

The award honors Wilham A Nierenberg. 
who served as director of Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography from 1965 to 1986. 

GoodaH beRan to obseIve wild chimpanzees 
in th 1960s m she traveled to Tanzania. She 
diSC()Jefed that chimpanzees, who were previ-
ous¥ thought to be helbivores, were in fact 
omnivores. She also witnessed their ability to 
make tools, which challenged the prior belief that 
this abaity distinguished humans from animals. 
Documenting the behavior of chimpanzees in 
the wild, Goodall was able to point out their 
social hierarchy and later discovered that chim-
panzees engage in primitive warfare. 

Since then, Goodall has founded the Jane 
Goodall InstiMe, a woridwide network of indi-
viduals committed to promoting healthy 
ecosystems and sustainable livelihoods. 

Scripps scientist finds one 
of Earth's earliest lifeforms 

A team of intemational scientists, including 
a scientist from Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography, have identified what is believed 
to be one of Earth's eariiest forms of life. 

The team of scientists from Norway, Canada 
and South Africa, as well as Hubert Staudigel of 
Scripps, found microscopic life colonized in 
anaent vOlcanic lava dating back nearly 3.5 bil-
lion yea rs. The findings were reported in the 
April 23 edition of Sdence. 

In 200 I, Staudigel and his colleagues dIocu-
mented heM' microscopic organisms smaller 
than the width of a human hair are able to eat 
their way into volcanic rock to form long tubes. 
The new study describes a similar finding in the 
Barberton Greenstone Belt a region several hun-
dred miles east of Johannesbu~ South Africa. 
According to the scientists, the diSCovery proves 
that microbial processes that can be seen today 
also occurred during the early stages of the Earth. 

Staudigel has argued that the region's pre-
vious geographic position in a submarine envi-
ronment DeieM' the ocean floor may have pro-
vided protection from the effects of meteorites 
on the Earth's surface billions of years ago.

UC lab may lose nuke -reserves 
Decision could change lab's core mission 

. By ADEll IQBAL 
Daily Californian (U. Califomia-

Berkeley) 
(U-WIRE) BERKELEY, Calif. 

- In an effort to cut down on pos-
sible targets for a nuclear terrorist 
attack. the U .S. Departtnent of 
Energy may remove Lawrence 
Livermore National Laboratory's 
plutonium and uranium reserves-
a move that could transform the 
lab's core mission and its future 
under UC management. 

In a congressional hearing on 
April 27, representatives from the 
General Accounting Office testi-
fied that a terrorist threlit to the 
nuclear weapons facility may be far 
greater than anticipated. 

The D.O.E. has traditionally 
prepared for preventing theft of 
nuclear weapons materia1s. but the 
accounting office report released 
April 27 suggests that a suicide team 
of terrorists could barricade them-
selves in the facility and detonate a 
malceshift nuclear weapon - a con-
cern for the Livermore lab, which is 
about 40 miles southeast of Berkeley. 

"Without question, D.O.E. 
nuclear warhead pr.oduction plants, 
test facilities, research labs, storage 
locations and decommissioned sites 

are attractive targets for terrorists 
determined to turn our technology 
against us. and willing to die while 
doing so," Rep. Christopher Shays 
(R-COM.) said at the hearing. 

Consolidating nuclear material 

" We received the highest 
rating possible from 

the Office of Security. 
We feel that the 
lab is very safe,"

storage would improve security by 
reducing the number of sites and the 
cost of protecting them, Shays said. 

Lawrence Livermore lab offi-
cials dismissed the concerns about 
a possible terrorist attack, saying 
the lab is addressing a number of 
credible threats and has increased 
its security force. 

"We received the highest rating 
possible through the Office of 

Security." lab spokesperson Lynda 
Seaver said. "We feel the lab is very 
safe." 

Removing Livermore lab's plu-
tonium reserves could fundamen-
tally shift the mission of the lab. 
which has focused on nuclear 
weapons defense since its inception 
in the 1950s. 

The proposal could spark a shift 
in opinion about whether the uni-
versity should bid to manage the 
lab, said Lawrence Pitts, chair of 
the systemwide Academic Senate. 
the UC faculty decision-malcing 
body. 

"If the labs changed their char-
acter in their totality, would that 
change the bidding process?" Pitts 
said. "The answer is absolutely 
sure." 

Much of the argument against a 
Livermore lab contract bid has 
centered on whether a public uni-
versity should have a hand in devel-
oping and stockpiling nuclear 
weapons. 

"If the Universiry of California 
manages the Livermore and Los 
Alamos labs. they have an absolute 
responsibility not to lend the man-
tle of academic respectability to the

need to keep it an acceptable price." 

The event was sponsored by the 
San Diego Stop the Cuts Coalition, 
a group with representatives from 
the different college campuses. 
The protest was also part of a 
statewide srudent walk-out coordi-
nated with srudent groups similar 
to the San Diego coalition. 

The list of concerns srudents 
voiced during the rally and protest 
included the proposals to cut finan-
cial aid and outreach programs and 
[0 increase srudent fees at each col-
lege system. 

"Given that the Legislature is 
really not representing what the 
priorities are in this state, it's really 
important for us to come out, col-
laborating as students. to say we're 
not going to accept this kind of 
attack on the basic right of having 
an education that is affordable and 
available." Rebecca Anshell. a 
member of the UCSD Coalition to 
Stop the Cuts. said. 

The rally began at 10:30 a.m. at 
San Diego City College. where stu-
dent spealeers encouraged the crowd 
to demand affordable education. 

The protesters wallced 40 blocks. 
stopping traffic at intersections. 
Escorted by the San Diego police. 
protesters marched to the governor's 
downtown San Diego office chanti-
ng. "Don't tall students, WI the rich." 
The students stationed themselves in 
front of the governor's office on 
Front Street while speakers contin-
ued to disruss how the proposed cuts 
and fee increases would affect them. 

Heather Flowe, vice president 
of external affairs of UCSD's

that the fee increases are detrimen-
tal to the economic state of

California. 

" [Students) contribute to the 
economic vitality. of this state. we 
keep this state going," Flowe said. 
"We need to invest in our educa-
tion. not eliminate them. if we're 
going to get out of this budget cri-
sis. We cannot balance the budget 
on the backs of our students." 

Protesters sent a delegation of 
six students from the different San 
Diego colleges inside the office to 
deliver a letter stating the protest-
ers' demands. Earl Warren College 
junior Samara Bahoor was the 
UCSD undergraduate representa-
tive for the delegation. 

Bahoor said that she and other 
members of the coalition described 
to officials their personal ClI:JlCriences 
as students and spoke about the 
importance of outreach programs. 

"I spolce about working students 
and how it's going to malce it hard-
er for me to live," Bahoor said. 

The governor's proposals 
include the elimination of outreach 
programs. a 10-percent increase in 
student fees for UC resident 
undergraduates and a 4O-percent 
increase for graduate students. 

California State University stu-
dents spoke about the S24O-million 

cut the CSU system might face. 
which. they said, would mean fewer 
classes and professors. Community 
college srudents also spolee about 
the importance of outreach and 
maintaining the lower tuition fees. 

"It is so important to have com-
munity colleges because it is cheap 
and [that's) the main reason why peo-
ple go." Bahoor. who transferred to 
UCSD &-om a community college. 
said. "It's important to maintain the 
lower level of tuition so that people 
can get an education." 

For John Muir College fresh-
man Tam Phan. who currently 
.receives financial aid. the protest 
was a new experience. 

"[The protest) felt very empow-
ering. seeing all these people from 
the different colleges come togeth-
er," Phan said. 

While there are no definite 
plans for other rallies. the coalition 
is continuing to meet and is plan-
ning an event in May when the 
revisions t6 the proposed budget 
are made. according to Balthasar. 

"I thinle that [the protest) went 
exceptionally well." Balthasar said. 
"It was one of the first times stu-
dents from all the areas and col-
leges marched together."

Warren fee needed, but 
campaign is unfair 

Earl Warren College students are voting on a $12-per-year fee 
increase this week. The 
increase might be necessary 
to deal with budget cuts -
wese has the smallest bud-
get despite having the most 
students - but die election 
process has been unethical. 

wesc, which spent itself 
into debt last year with 
$1 ,500 worth of Frisbees and 
zip wallets, has neglected 
Warren's commuters liy mak-
ing it impossible for them to 
vote from home. Rather than 
holding the election on 
StudentLink, the council 
instead opened two paper-
ballot polling places: one near 
the Pnce Center shuttle stop 
and one in the Warren resi-
dence area. Not every com-
muter visits the Price Center 
shuttle stop, and commuters 
have no reason to aprroach 
the Warren residentia com-
plex. More~)Ver, ~ommuters 
have more mcenttve to vote 
against paying more money 
to a council tha t focuses 
almost exclusively on resi-
dents. wcse seems to have 
intentionally slanted the elec-
tion to favor residents over 
commuters in order to ensure 
the referendum's approval. 

USA Today's participation 
in the elecnon 15 also trou-
bling. It has paid over $2,000 
for referendum advertising 
and publicity. Should the fee 
increase faiT, the newspaper 
stands to lose money wilen 
funding is cut for the $9,000-
per-year Readership 
Program. Although there IS 
no written guarantee that 
wesc woufd continue to 
fund USA Today, it is a huge 
conflict of interest for the 
paper to fund the referen-
aum. rfWCSC had bothered 
to hold the election on 
StudentLink, USA Todtly's 
money for the polling sta-
tions and other "get-out-and-
vote" efforts would be 
unnecessary. 

Regardless of whether the 
fee increase passes, WCSC 
must remember to address 
commuters' needs. WCSC 
neglected commuters by 
refusing to hold an online 
election, but would do well to 
remember that commuters 
constitute the majority of 
Warren students. If Warren's 
student leaders forget to cater 
to them, they may face the 
wrath of commuters whose 
long-term memory could 
prove better than theirs in the 
next election. 

Zero ... tolerance policy 
overly burdens students 
A .s. Commissioner of Student Advocacy Jeff 

Boyd announced last 
week that Eleanor Roosevelt 
College tallied the most acad-
emic dishonesty cases last 
year, accounting for 46 per-
cent of all cases at UCSD with 
97 of a total 210 - over twice 
as many as any other college. 
The scope of this discrepancy 
casts doubt on the academic 
dishonesty policy used to 
prosecute suspected cheaters. 

Boyd attributed the vol-
ume of cases to the college's 
use of the popular online pla-
giarism prevention service 
Tumitin.com in Making of 
the Modem World classes. 
While there is nothing inher-
ently wrong with running a 
student's work through a data-
base to compose what the ser-
vice calls "originality reports" 
and "similarity indexes," its 
coupling with a zero-toler-
ance policy like the one used 
at ERC is problematic. 

It is unfair for only some 
colleges to use Turnitin.com 
- made available to all facul-

ty by the Office of Student 
Policies and Judicial Affairs in 
2001 - in their required 
writing classes. Even if the 
system were flawless, students 
at different colleges should 
not face different degrees of 
dishonesty investigation when 
the consequences of a prose-
cution can involve academic 
probation, an F or worse. 

The very nature of a zero-
tolerance policy is dangerous 
when a for-profit business is 
responsible for raising the red 
flag that mandates a case. A 
certain amount of error is 
inevitable when student work 
is compared with millions of 
published works and student 
papers, as well as the contents 
of the Internet. While ERC 
Dean of Student Affairs 
Patricia Scott claims the poli-
cy has been re-evaluated since 
the slew of cases, ERC and 
others employing 
Tumitin.com would do well 
to revisit the cases wrongly 
prosecuted and develop a 
more flexible approach in the 
future.

"1 LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Anti-Semitism thrives 

on Library walk 
Editor: 

Anyone who opposes bigotry, 
ignorance and hate should be 
appalled by the April 26 display 
on Library Walk. After 6 million 
Jews were massacred in the 
Holocaust, the swastilca was used 
once again against the Jewish 
people during the anti-Zionism 
display on Library Walk on April 
26. 

Following such proud displays 
of solidarity against hate during 
Take Back the Night and the Day 
of Silence for the LGBTQIA, 
one would hope that UCSD 
would be a community that 
would not condone hate, discrim-
ination or intimidation for any 
group. The fact that there was 
not widespread protesting against 
the use of Nazi propaganda 
aimed at the Jewish people and 
Israel reflects very poorly on the 
UCSD community as a whole. 
Before today, I had only seen 
swastikas being used for political 
means in old photos, with their 
captions in German. 

In stark contrast to the dreary, 
morbid display of anti-Semitic 
propaganda, the Israel AJIiance 
group flew American flags next to 
Israeli ones to show that the two 
countries were both progressive 
democracies that support free-

dom of religion, speech and 
thought. Israel offers far more 
rights for homosexuals and 
women, for example, than any 
nation in that region. 

In addition to the swastikas, 
one could also find clearly anti-
Semitic political cartoons of Ariel 
Sharon, which made him look 
like a character from a Nazi chil-
dren's book. There is suffering

today in the Middle East the 
same as there was suffering in 
Germany in the 19305. Like the 
anti-Semitism of yesterday, the 
fingers are again being pointed at 
the Jews as the people to blame 
for the world's misery. When will 

we students heed the call of duty 
from those exterminated by hlte, 
and learn to stand up against hate 
and bigotry against all people? 

It is easy to dismiss what hap-
pened here today by convincing 
yourself that you don't know 
enough about the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict. True, there 
are many issues to be explored 
before one could malee an educat-
ed judgment. But it doesn't take a 
genius to observe a swastika being 
flown at an anti-Zionism rally 
and put two and two together and 
realize that anti-Semitism is 
being perpetuated here at UCSD. 

What happened in Germany 
was incomprehensible to the peo-
ple at the time, because they felt 
that in the modern age, such 
widespread anti-Semitic violence 
was impos.~ible. Nazism was dis-
missed as freedom of expression 
until it had caught Germany by 
the throat. With synagogues 
being bombed in Europe, build-
ings becoming targets in 
America, and innocent civilians 
like you and me being torn apart 
by nail studded bombs in the 
streets of Jerusalem, it is time for 
everyone to realize that freedom 
itself is under attack. Once again 
the question arises whether the 
Jewish people, and all people who 
advocate rights for diversity, can 
exist. As the banner which dis-

Gouging students for excess units is bad policy 
Save money by avoiding marijuana munchies this summer 
horse's 

mouth 
EdWu 

W hile many aspects of the proposed budget cuts to the UC system are no 
doubt galling, this writer has 
argued in the past that fee increas-
es are necessary to maintain the 
quality of the UC system, 50 long 
as disadvantaged students are 
given the assistance they need to 
attend college. However, one 
aspect of the proposed second 
round of tuition hikes is particu-
larly troubling: the 
Schwarzenegger administration's 
proposal that students who talee 
more than 110 percent of the 
credits necessary for graduation 
begin to pay tuition at out-of-
state rates. Slipped into the mael-
strom, most protesrers·have hard-
ly noticed the clause, but the gov-
ernor's office believes it can save 
59 million per year by essentially 
penalizing students for their intel-
lectual curiosity. The figure seems 
grossly misleading and the tactic 
itself could compromise educa-
tional quality for the best and 
brightest in the UC system who 
also happen to be the most disad-
vantaged. 

It appears that the only possi-
ble origin of the $9 million figure 
is from computing the excess 
number of units students are 

graduating with, and multiplying 
by the penalty. But this figure in 
no way represents the actual cost 
of teaching students for more 
than 110 percent of their units. 
Often times, these students are 
double majors, in which case due 
to the limited number of courses 
they can take in a quaner, any 
spaces they fill in classes above 16 
units would most likely be empty 
anyway. Perhaps the new struc-
ture targets the other breed of 
students who exceed 110 percent 
of required uniu: wayward acade-
mic wanderers, who jump from 
major to major over the course of 
seven or eight years. But why 
penalize students for academic 
curiosity? The lower-division 
classes that those studenu take are 
taught in large lecture halls where 
the additional cost of a few extra 
students is essentially zero. 
Perhaps both the double majors 
and the wandering studenu add a 
bit on the load in the way of TAs 
and grading, but it is not as if the 
classes - and the units that they 
take - would not exist were it not 
for the extra units . 

In the case of the double 
majors and students with minors 
in particular, the policy seems to 
penalize academic investigation, 
and even worse, it has the poten-
tial to create a two-tier system 
within UC among the brightest 
who undertake heavier worldoad~. 
Financi.al aid offices most likely 
will neglect the somewhat mar-
ginal cases of double majors in 
need of support, or at best, use 
those much-needed funds to take 

on additional students at Uc. 
However, students who are better 
off can afford in-depth education 
in more than one field. Due to the 
increasing importance of non-lib-
eral arts degrees with career-spe-
cific training, such as engineering 

" In short, the proposed policy penalizes academic 
investigation and further 

hurts motivated 
disadvantaged students, 
when all students should 

be exploring classes 
outside of their majors, 
either tD further prepare 

themselves far the 
work farce or tD broaden 

their understanding 
of the world. " 

or economics, a "one-major-fits-
all" approach is unjustified. 
Students very well could use com-
plementary education from multi-
ple fields that they can best pick 
up in college. A biologist very 
well could use pr~ng skills 
in her future work, and certainly 
aspiring engineers should be 

encouraged to take classes involv-
ing plenty of reading and writing, 
lest they graduate with the brains 
to create useful machines without 
the ability to communicate what 
they actually do. 

In short, the proposed policy 
penalizes academic investigation, 
and further hurts motivated dis-
advantaged students, when all stu-
dents should be exploring classes 
outside of their majors, either to 
further prepare themselves for the 
work force or to broaden their 
understanding of the world. It 
penalizes despite the fact that pre-
venting motivated students from 
filling up empty spaces will likely 
save the state very little money. 

If the rest of the tuition hike 
proposals are passed, this relative-
ly minor issue probably will fall in 
with the rest of them. Perhaps 
UC campuses can help skirt this 
requirement by establishing 
"expected graduation unit 
counts," which are higher for 
double and triple majors, and stu-
dents with minors. Leave it to the 
administrators to be the enlight-
ened ones. This writer tries, in 
any case, to be optimistic. 

W ith the many UCSD stu-dents who live off-cam-pus in 12-month con-
tracts, the summer no 

doubt represents an albatross 
where students must either sublet 
their rooms, at substantial cost, or 
make some use of their time in 
San Diego. As a veteran of San 
Diego summer living, this writer 
feds that he is qualified to make 

at least a few suggestions: 
I. If at all possi ble, take sum-

mer classes. While sitting for 3 
hours straight in a class twice a 
week might not seem appealing, 
the classes are far easier than 
classes during the normal acade-
mic year, and somehow, this 
writer manages to learn more dur-
ing them, although that might just 
be an illusion of the condensed 
time frame. In any case, he wishes 
that all quarters were only 5 
weeks long. 

2. Get a research job on cam-
pus if at an possible. The times 
wiJI be far more flexible to taking 
classes on campus, and .there is 
plenty of money around for 
undergraduates seeking to do 
research (notably the chancellor's 
undergraduate research scholar-
ship). It's far more appealing on a 
resume than working retail, and it 
pays about the same. 

l . Try avoiding both the beach 
and marijuana. Salty air or a case 
of the munchies can only increase 
one's food budget, and between 
rent, classes and a job in either 
retail or a lab, perhaps it's best to 
stay on a diet.

Annual event about 
more than feminism 

Editor: 
Recent articles, opinions, and 

letters to the editor in the 
Guardian have created a controver-
sy over Take Back the Night. By 
arguing over feminist philosophy 
in relation to the event, every arti-
cle has lost sight of the issue at 
hand. Take Back the Night is not a 
feminist event. It is not even an 
cvenf just for women . It is a com-
munity event. exual assault and 
domestic violence are communiry 
issues. Both men and women are 
affected when someone is raped 
and/or beaten. 

Had anyone writing these arti-
cles been to Take Back the ight, 
they would have seen that there 
was a good-sized consti tuency of 
men. These men were applauded 
for helping to break stereotypes 
and myths that concern these 
issues. The men were also given 
the opportunity to share their own 
experiences, which many did. Men 
made some of the most powerful 
statements of the night. T his event 
was created to bring awareness to 
the UCSD community and perpet-
uate action to stop crimes against 
both men and women. It is dis-
heartening to have students come 
up to you and say, "People are 
raped here?" Take Back the Night 
showed me that UCSD is not 

always apathetic and students here 
can create a powerful healing envi-
ronment. 

To clear up another issue, the 
A.S. Women's Commission is not a 
feminist organization. The com-
mission is trying to create a safe 
space on campus for women of aU 
races, religion and political affilia-
tions to voice their opinions. If 
people like Adam Bronstein and 
Kelly Gi I bert are still offended by 
what the Women's Commission is 
doing, we invite them to get 
involved, check their facts and put 
some action behind their empty 
words.

No need for animal 
cruelty at UCSD 

Editor: 
I would like to thank Lisa Mak 

for her article on vivisection 
because it demands our attention 
("Groups protest animal testing," 
April 22). ot simply because it is 
cruel , outdated and unnecessary, 
but because it is unreliable and 
dangerous. We know that humans 
aren't the same as dogs and are 
even less similar to mice, a notion 
lost on UCSD cognitive science 
professor Andrea Chiba, who reas-
sures us that a large number of ani-
mals killed at UCSD are mice. It is 
no comfort to me that more mice, 
dogs, rabbits, rats, guinea pigs and 
birds suffer and die than primates. 
I'm opposed to caging our closest 
relatives and giving them diseases 
that we're no closer to curing than 
we were 20 years ago. I'm opposed 
to testing amphetamines on dogs. 

Lab animals experience unalle-
viated pain: They are poisoned, 
blinded, shocked, confined and 

burned, subjected to radiation and 
chemical and biological weapons, 
their bones fractured. They endure 
maternal deprivation experiments 
and mice, rats and macaque mon-
keys alone are currently being used 
in 445 tests on the effects of 
cocaine. 

UCSD receives almost $200 
million in federal funds (your tax 
dollars) for research. If anyone

other than white-coated lab tech-
nicians treated animals this way, 
they'd go to jail. 

A growing number in the med-
ical profession, such as Physicians' 
Committee for Responsible 
Medicine, are telling us that vivi-
section is unreliable. By studying 
human populations, scientists saw 
a correlation between cigarettes 
and cancer, but unfortunately for 
those that continued to die from 
lung cancer, the labeling of ciga-
rettes as carcinogenic was delayed 
for years because results from ani-
mal tests didn't come to that con-
clusion. More people die each year 
from reactions to legal drugs, 
found safe in animals, than from all 
illegal drugs combined. Visit 
Students AgainstAnimal Suffering 

at http://suasucsd.tripod.com for 
information. 

It's callous to claim that inflict-
ing pain on more than 20 million 
animals in this country each year is 
helping animals, as if testing on 
thousands of nameless dogs and 
cats is justifiable to possibly save 
others, when there are available 
alternatives. The leading cause of 
death in companion animab is 
human action. u-r are killing them. 
If we put a fraction of the money 
that we dedicate to vivisection into 
spay/neuter programs, we could 
actually make an impact on their 
lives. 

If animal experimentation was 
ever necessary, it no longer is. 
What diseases we can't prevent, we 
can attempt to cure through 
nonanimal research methods. As 
Dr. Mark Feinberg, a leading 
AIDS researcher, said, "What 
good does it do you to test some-
thing in a monkey? You find five or 
six years from now that it works in 
the monkey, and then you test it in 
humans and you realize that 
humans behave totally differently 
from monkeys, so you've wasted 
five years." Let them go. The acts 
committed against animals are 
called necessary evils, but they are 
not necessary, and are diverting 
attention and money from real 
progress. Caring about the suffer-
ing of the smallest beings among 
us may not be the most important 
thing we can do, but they do mat-
ter.

approximately half of the 20 people 
present for the event. Each 
described their personal connection 
to pre-collegiate programs and 
opponunities they received 
through targeted outreach. 

"These programs have been cru-
cial with my persistence in school-
ing and higher education," GSA 
adviser Freeda Warren said. 

She credited the extra boost 
enrichment services under the QUl-
reach umbrella gave her to attend 
college. 

The group pledged to support 
UC President Robert C. Dynes in 
his negotiations with state lawmak-
ers, whose budget plan proposed 
eliminating all funding for the pr0-
grams. Representing various campus 
groups, several of those present said 
they would write letters backing 
Dynes in his pledge to redirect por-
tions of the universitys core budget 
to fund the programs slated for cuts. 

"I support [Dynes' pledge) fuU-
heartedly," Hugh Mehan, a sodol-
ogy professor and director of the 
Center for Research on 
Educational Equity and Teaching 
Excellence, said. 

However, Mehan, who defended 
outreach programs in a December 
2003 testimony before the state 
Senate's budget subcommittee, 
called Dynes' proposal a "mixed 
blessing" that could alienate faculty 
members who have proven to be an 
important but lukewarm ally in the 
fight to preserve the programs. 

Predicting that few among the 
faculty would be willing to sacrifice 
money slated for salaries and 
research, Mehan said they never-
theless had a stake in seeing out-
reach succeed. 

"We have to get the faculty to 
realize that its in its best interest to 
have a diverse srudent body," he said. 

According to Mehan, the issue 
has become a "political football" 
for UC administrators and legisla-
tors - one that has lacked sincere 
backing since its inception. 

"I'm incredibly pissed off about 
the situation," Kris Kohler, a sec-
ond-year sociology graduate stu-
den, said. 

Kohler also chaired the UC 
Student Association when the Board 
of Regents initially adopted SP-1 
and SP-2 in 1995, two resolutions 
banning race and gender preference 
in admissions and employment. 

According to Kohler, the 
Regents compromised with stu-
dents and faculty who had united 
against the decisions by boosting 
funding for outreach programs to 
preserve access to the UC system 
for disadvantaged students. 

"As we were fighting to protect 
affirmative action, we were excited 
that people wanted to expand these 
programs," Kohler said. 

He now says he believes that 
decision was disingenuous, with the 
Board and legislators waiting for the 
first available opportunity to make 
"political backdoor deals" and elimi-
nate the programs again, an opportu-
nity they discovered with the state's 
budget crisis. 

Rafael Hernandez, director of the 
Early Academic Outreach Program, 
urged students to speak out and pres-
sure political leaders. 

"You, as students, have a tremen-
dous amount of power, especially 
when you remind them that you 
vote and that you register others to 
vote," Hernandez said. 

EAOP had mel and surpassed 
three of its four five-year goals set 
during the 1998-99 school year one 
year early. It projected to meel the 
last goal by the end of the required 
period, according to Hernandez. 
Because of the programs success, he

Atkinson also described the 
encounter that led him to begin 
his effort to change the nature of 
standardized testing. 

"On the way home [from a

to visit my grandchildren," 
Atkinson said. "I found my

seventh grade, already diligendy 
preparing for the S.A. T. by test-

analogies ... I was amazed at the 
amount of time and effort 
involved, all in anticipation of the 
S.A. T. Was this how I wanted my 
granddaughter to spend her

Atkinson then described the 
development of the debate dur-

ducted by the University of

sample and that test should have 
more mathematics than simply 
an eighth grade introduction to 
algebra." 

Following his speech, 
Atkinson fielded questions from 
the audience, including ques-

tions regarding the A.C.T. and 
the relative importance of apti-
tude as opposed to achieve-
ment. 

"I'm not interested [in a stu-
dent's IQ)," Atkinson said in 
response to the question. "I'm 
interested in knowing what a stu-
dent has achieved." 

The speech, which included 
numerous humorous anecdotes, 
elicited laughter from the audi-
ence on several occ .sions. 

"I'm glad to see that he has 
not lost his sense of humor after 
so many years in administration," 
Anagnostopoulos said. 

Atkinson served as the 17th 
UC president between 1995 and 
2003 and as UCSD chancellor 
between 1980 and 1995. He has 
also served as director of the 
National Science Foundation

Academy of Science, the

EAOP: Outreach supporters strategize 
cOnlinued from page 7 

argued lawmakers had poor timing 
in proposing their cuts. 

"If this was a business, it would 
not be a time to cut [its budgetl," 
Hernandez said. "When you're 
having success, it's time to add to 
the coffers." 

The proposed budget cuts 
would affect 28 outreach programs 
run by the UC and CSU systems, 
he said. These programs involve 
acaderriic development for all stu-
dents, including those from K-12, 
community college and graduate or 
professional programs. 

According to Hernandez, the 
state had a duty to maintain fund-
ing for the programs, pointing out 
that only 20 percent of high schools 
in California supply more than 55 
percent of the students adrrUtted to 
the University of California. 

Emmanuelle Regis, an organiz-
er at the San Diego chapter of 
Californians for Justice, said the 
group would back efforts to stand 
up to the state. She said CFJ, a 
grassroots group that organizes 
high school students, would hold a

planned protest on May 17 to mark 
the !iO-year anniversary of Bruum v. 
BOiIT'd of EdUCtltion, the Supreme 
Court ruling ending segregated 
schooling. 

Flowe pledged to schedule more 
events to address the outreach cuts. 

"I think this is just a first even t, 
and there will be very many more, " 
Flowe said. 

UCSA: Report raises tuition hike concerns 
continued from page I 

increased fees will affect the quality 
of undergraduate education. 

"The university puts a lot of the 
teaching responsibility on graduate 
students, and when there's more 
fees for grad students, you're going 
to have fewer grad students, fewer 
TAs and fewer sections for classes, " 
UCSA chair Matt Kaczmarek said. 

\¥hile undergraduate enrollment 
has increased by 100 percent in the 
past three decades, graduate enroll-
ment has increased . .by only 7 per-
cent, according to statistics from the 
UC Office of the President. 

"Our lundergraduate] class-
roorns in the recent decades have 
swelled to the size of small cruise 
ships," said Heather Flowe, 
Graduate Student Association vice-
president of external affairs. "[Thel 
teaching load ... is increasing for 
both graduate students and faculty, 
leaving less time for research and 
innovation. Under these condi-
tions, recruiting the best faculty 
and students to the UC will 
become increasingly difficult." 

The repon c1aimea lhat there is 
a general misconception dut earn-
ing a graduate or professional 
degree at a UC campus costs signif-
icantly less than at comparable 
institutions. UC stipends are on 
average S2,772 less than amounts 
offered by comparable schools, 

according to the report. 
In addition, the report also 

states that the cost of living in 
California leads most UC students 
to spend more dun the recom-
mended 30 percent of their income 
on housing. The report listed the 
cost of living at the UCSD campus 
as 134 percent above the average 
national cost of living. 

According to Flowe, if the gov-
ernor's proposals are passed, med-
ical school students will incur 
another S15,OOO in debt. 

"Increasing the burden of debt 
will force professional students in 
greater numbers to seek careers 
outside of the public service sec-
tor," Flowe said. "If you have a 
mountain of debt to payoff, you 
need to go where you can earn the 
big bucks - in the private sector -
to pay your loans bade. We need to 
find ways to suppon students who 
want to have careers in public ser-
vice and with non-profits." 

Accordinr to Carol Hartupee, 
director of the School of Medicine 
financial aid office, the national 
average indebtedness for a medical 
school student in 2003 was 
S97,275. The average indebtedness 
for a student at the School of 
Medicine was 570,633. 

"There is a concern natiomvide 
with rising debts for medical stu-
dents," Hartupee said. 

The report also argued that an 
increase in graduate and profes-
sional fees and a reduction in the 
number of such students would be 
detrimental for the California 
economy. UC research and devel-
opment productivity gains between 
2002 to 2011 have been estimated 
at 55.2 billion, which would result 
in 104,000 new jobs for the state, 
according to the report. The esti-
mated impact of UC graduate stu-
dents on the gross regional product 
in San Diego in the science and 
engineering workforce is $236 mil-
lion, the report showed. 

IUczmarek feels that the fee 
increases will encourage many stu-
dents to pursue graduate and pro-
fessional education in other states. 

"In the long term, this will cause 
the state to lose its competitive 
edge in many leading local seCtors," 
IUcunarek said. 

The report concludes by urg-
ing the University of California to 
take several state initiatives, 
including maintaining the current 
fees and tuition rates for 2003-04, 
reducing graduate and profession-
al student fees in the long term, 
creating a program of repayable 
fellowships for doctoral students 
who choose to teach in the state 
upon graduation, and increasing 
funding to university outreach 
programs.

K KY'S Latin rock@ 
an Diego's PINBA UB 

Lecal band Pinback 3pecialize in dreamy melanchelic pep 
By IAN S. POIT 

Staff Writer 

The kind of music Pin back play - lonely, complex indie pop 
- is not the kind of music 

one would expect to come from 
San Diego. Decidedly on the 
opposite side of the musical spec-
trum from the aggressive hard 
rock (or adolescent pop-punk) 
that has , for better or worse, come 
to represent San Diego music , 
Pin back combine the classical ele-
ments of the indie-pop canon with 
a melodic and satisfying - if 
somewhat homogenous - brand 
of modern rock. 

A collaboration of the creative 
energies of Armistead Burwell 
Smith IV and Rob Crowe, 
Pinback began as a part-time 
recording project, then grew into 

a larger commitment when both 
members put their other bands 
(including 3 Mile Pilot and 
Thingy) on hold. Following 
recording sessions, a bidding war 
and subsequent legal battle, 
Pinback's self-titled debut was 
finally released in 1998. 

The band's debut finds Smith 
and Crowe picking and choosing 
from sounds previously placed on 
the indie-pop shelf by bands like 
Sunny Day Real Estate and 
Modest Mouse. Exploring the 
artier side of emo, Pinbllc/t beauti-
fully defined the group's signature 
drone-like guitar tone and the 
lush, two-voice chorus that 's the

the Pinback sound, as exemplified 
by the group's 1998 debut, is its

REVIEW 

The bad? Many of the srunts are 
CG-animated and look that way. 
\\!hereas in a film like "Crouching 
Tiger, Hidden Dragon" the stuntS 
looked almost believable in their 
fluidity, these are completely car-
toonish and ridiculous. At times, 
the stuntS are hil arious. Other 
times they feel inhuman and awk-
ward. 

There's also the fact that the 
Shaolin team is just too good. 
Beyond the initial frustrations, 
there's no chall enge in the 
monks' victories. It becomes less 
like "Bad ews Bears" and more 
like watching the Yankees - you 
don 't want to root for them. That 
is, until, they come up against 
Team Evil, an anonymously vil -
lainous group of players hopped 
up on those pesley "American 
drugs." This final showdown is 
by far the best part of the film, 
showcasing impressive special 
effects as the players fire balls 
down the Held like Dragonball Z 
characters. 

"Shaolin Soccer" has its share 
of flaws, namely that at a much-
cut 87 minutes, the character 
development and love story don't 
make much sense. But fans of both 
Kung Fu films and slapstick com-
edy shouldn't miss this dose of 
riotous filmmaking from overseas.

'I'm Not Scared' reflects on innocence 
The Italian 'Stand By Me' proves to be more than just a horror flick 

By ANNE CONC-HUYEN 
Hiatus Editor 

HOw doe a dIrect r combine element of a thriller, a com-ing-oC-age tory and a come-
dy into one decent film? Sounds 
impossible, but somehow 
Gabrielle Salvatores 
(" Medetcrraneo,,) doe it with 
ama zing succe in his newest 
film, "10 on flo Paun" (''I'm 

ot Scared"). 
Set In a small rural Italian 

own, dunng the heat wave of 
1978, a likable 10-yea r-old, 
Michele (Giuseppe Cristiano), 
finds a hole dug into the grouncl 
by an abandoned house and dis-
covers anoth~ r young hoy, Filipo 
(Mattia De Pierro), held captive 
there. \\!hat follows is a frighten-
ing and almost heartbreaking tale 
of strained friendship and lost 
innocence told through the eyes 

of a wise child. 
The picturesque, untouched 

countryside through which 
Michele, his four-eyed sister and 
his friends ride and frolic seems an 
unlikely place for a horrific secret, 
but the idyllic serting sets a perfect 
soft, slow tone for the rest of the 
film. This tone and locale are 
depicted with a painter's care 
through bright cinematography 
that perfectly captures everything 
down to the beads of sweat on a 
child's brow. Through this 
painstaking care, the mood 
instantly changes from being 
sunny and lighthearted to dark 
and perilous throughout film. 

The young star Pierro .is so 
touchjng that one cannot re:;ist his 
charmingly realistic character. 
Unspoiled, yet strangely intuitive 
and bright, Pierro creates a pro-
tagonist that is ultimately lovable 
and softly caprures the viewer's

mention with a strong grasp. His 
interactions with other characters, 
whether they are his peers or his 
parents, are tangible yet subtle. 

His relationships with his 
immature and innocent little 
friends strikingly mirror the care-
fully observed, desperate adults-
and to an eerie effect. Instead of 
just another lame horror fliCk, 
Salvatores delivers an incredibly 
human experience in a captivating 
film. 

Not a dreary, dark thriller like 
the ones Hollywood has been 
passing off as intelligent movies 
(think "Taking Lives" or 
"Gothika"), "I'm Not Scared," is 
free of cliches or cheap artifices to 
frighten or shOCk. Instead, what 
Starts as a thoroughly shoclcing 
film, even for those who expect it, 
ultimately becomes a strong tale 
of childhood friendship and dis-
covery that doesn't recycle normal 
film conventions. The film 
becomes one that is marvelously 
affecting and satisfying.

Sex and deceit satiate 
brooding 'Young Adam' 

McGregor and Swinton reveal unadulterated 
depictions of despair and deception 

By ANNA DYLEWSKA 
Senior Staff Writer 

With its raunchy sex, unlikable characters and morally ambiguous atmosphere, the 
1950's Glasgow, Scotland, depicted 
in "Young Adam" in no way resem-
bles Eden. The title of the film iron-
ically implies an ideallistically pure 
environment, yet writer/director 
David Mackenzie's bleak outlook 
only has room for deception, betray-
al, cold indifference and a faux set of 
ethics that immediately connect ex 
with crime. Mackenzie's picture is 
anything but pleasant. But the W1Set-
ding snapshot of unspectacular blue-
collar life and its naked, flawed char-
acters are fascinating in a strange, 
uncomfortable way.

neous romps on the dirt and rocks 
and in a jerky boat, as well as their 
disastrous parting. Mortimer and 
McGregor infuse the relationship 
with the necessary level of uncon-
trolled desire that explains Joe's 
inability to fully part with her. 
Mortimer nicely adopts a well-bal-
anced mixmre of strength and vul-
nerability, and she brilliantly han-
dles a moment in which Joe sub-
jects Cathie to sadomasochistic 
humiliation that involves custard 
and some condiments. 

Former Tallcing Head David 
Byrne's apprehensive musical score 
contributes an unnerving quality to 

(peter Mullan) fish 
the body of an 
almost naked 
woman out of the 
Clyde River. Her 
death is a mystery, 
until her connec-
tion to Joe slowly 
begins to unravel. 
Joe is a Scottish 
drifter who finds 
shelter and work 
on a barge owned 
by the orrunary Les 
and his reticent 
wife Ella (filda 
Swinton). Joe soon 
woos Ella with a 
bl unt stare and the 
two take part in a 
dirty love affair.

and enhances the 
characters' con-
flicting thoughts. 
The film contains 
sparse dialogue, 
so almost all char-
acter analysis has 
to come from the 
actors and the 
serting. The coal-
gray city in which 
even the few lush 
green trees quick-
ly become shad-
owed by dust sug-
gests an envi ron-
ment in which 
principles have 
little meaning, able " way. 

In teresti ngly, 
Mackenzie strips their graphic sex 
scenes of ardor or affection, perhaps 
to emphasi ze the pair's hapless lives. 

Additionally, McGregor anci 
Swinton strip down their charac-
ters - both on physical and emo-
tionallevel. McGregor sheds all of 
the glamorous charm that he 
flaunted in "Moulin Rouge" and 
"Big Fish" and becomes a cold, 
indifferent man who is reclusive 
about his feelings and at odds with 
his conscience. He obsessively 
watches couples rumpling sheets, 
beds numerous women, and 
smokes enough cigarettes to rival 
Colin Farrell. Swinton delicately 
taps into tile newly awakened pas-
sion of a bored, h~rd-worlcing wife 
and mother, and she gives some of 
her dialogues with McGregor a 
delicious slice of wit and humor. 

While the two lovers engage in 
their adulterous lust, Joe recalls his 
stormy relationship with a former 
dutiful and abused girlfriend, 
Cathie (Emily Mortimer). He 
fondly remembers their sponta-

and where sin ha~ 
a place to breed . 

The characters come through as 
damaged individuals, but it is 
impossible to feel pity for any of 
them because none of them are 
decent or blameless. The rough 
world of the film is difficult to 
digest because of its grittiness and 
the lack of distinction between 
good and bad, or guilty and inno-
cent. There are times when the 
explicit sex scenes are overbearing, 
and the hopelessness of the plot 
becomes a bit tiresome, particular-
ly when it reaches the rather 
unclear, inconclusive ending. 
However, the emotional honest 
with which the actors infuse their 
characters gives the film a rare 
potency.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY, APRIL 29, 2004 

'Nothing to Declare' is colorfully poetic 
Mexican-American culture and politics questioned in dance piece 

By JESSICA LONG 
Senior Staff Writer 

Just in time for Cinco de Mayo, the Patricia Rincon Dance Collective presents "Nothing to 
Declare," a unique look at 
Mexican-American culrure. 

"Nothing to Declare" was born 
out of what Rincon describes as the 
"profound experience" of returning 
to Mexico 30 years after moving to 
the United States, where she found 
herself surrounded by her "family, 
heritage, history and roots." 

Confronted with this duel his-
tory that many Mexican 
Americans face, she sought to cre-
ate a piece that dealt head on with 
the struggles and achievements of 
the community. Rincon carefully 
crafted a piece that dealt with the 
evolution of Mexican-American 
stereotypes and the reality of 
being a Mexican American in the 
present day. 

In "Nothing to Declare," more 
traditional elements of Mexican 
culture collide with popular cul-
rure. Nowhere is this more appar-
ent than in the poetry written for 
the show by Adolfo Guzam, a 
member of the Taco Shop Poets. 
Spoken in both English and 
Spanish, the poetry adds continuity 
to the piece as it progresses. 

Not only does the production 
include dance and poetry, but also 
elements of musical theater such as 
singing and acting, which help to 

add more dimensions to the piece. 
The music in the production 
ranges from traditional Mexican 
music to rave, and more serious 
elements of the piece are balanced 
by moments of humor. 

" In 'Nothing to Declare,' 
more traditional elements 

of Mexican culture 
collide with popular 
culture. Nowhere 

is this more apparent 
than in the poetry 

written far the show by 
Adolfo Guzam, a 

member of the 
Taco Shop Poets. 

Many traditional Mexican 
symbols appear throughout the 
production, such as the image of 
the Madonna . One of the dances 
also features the imagery of 
brightly colored wrestling masks 
as the dancers use the primitive 
energies of wrestling to create a 

Dance 
PREVIEW 

dance that is aggressive yet beau-
tiful. 

Also on the program for the 
evening is "RushStop," the unique 
multimedia production that uses 
the work of animator Steve 
Churchill. This piece looks at the 
role of time in our society with 
brutal honesty and more than a bit 
of humor. Questioning and laugh-
ing at why we feel the need to 
schedule time to relax, this piece 
is something to which everyone 
can easily relate. 

These two works combine real 
life issues with the art of music, 
poetry, video and dance to bring 
the point home in a provocative yet 
humorous way. 

Performances will be held at 
Sledgehammer Theater at St. 
Cecilia's Church, located at 1620 
Sixth Ave . (at Cedar) in 
Downfown San Diego, April 29, 
April 30 and May I at 8 p.m. and 
May 2 at 7 p.m. Tickets are 518 
for general admission and 514 for 
students and seniors. TIckets can 
be purchased in advance by calling

'Earthquake Sun' traces timeless love 
By HEM SINGH 
Senior Staff Writer 

'T he mind is a labyrinth of 
illusion," says the old 

. woman on stage. This 
statement seems to capture 

the creative mind of Luis Valdez, 
the "godfather" of Chicano the-
ater, perfectly. "Earthquake Sun," 
the multiple award-winning 
writer and director's latest play, is 
a vision of a man traveling 
through three millennia in search 
of a lost love and lost brother. 
Though it boasts beautiful set 
designs, the play's overdone script 
makes it only a mediocre show.

by research into Mayan ideology 
and customs, namely the "Popol 
Vuh" (Mayan texts that include 
creation myths and history) and 
the "Rabinal Achi-The Warrior of 
Rabinal," a religious dance drama 
over two thousand years old. The 
deciphering of Mayan hieroglyph-
ics in recent decades has helped 
Valdez to add this cultural flair to 
his theatrical production. 

And what a production it is . 
The play begins very dramatically 
with a monologue by an old 
woman in a Mayan jungle in 712. 
Her role is to help Jaguar Kan, the 
protagonist played by Daniel 
Rangel, lind his lost lover and 
twin brother throughout the 

whole play. The audience is led to 
understand and identify with the 
situation of a man who has been 
thrown several thousand years 
back in time. The flow and story 
of the play are undercut by 
Valdez's feeble attempts to add 
humor through some very bad 
puns. At some points in the play, 
they are so overstated and poorly 
timed that one can't help but 
flinch. They bring down the qual-

THURSDAY, APRIL 29, 2004 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

The fine art of Television Diplomacy 
A pleasant evening turns into 'The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly' 

short kid 
are cool 
Jessica Kruskamp 

My boyfriend and I eye each other suspiciously. We stlre, hawlc-Iike, waiting for any 
sudden movements. Somewhere in 
the background, "The Good, the 
Bad, and the Ugly" theme song 
plays and our trigger fingers twitch, 
poised for action. Then we pounce. 

On the remote. 
I employ moves I've picked up 

from "Will & Grace" to finagle 
the remote froI1l his grasp; high 
kicks seem to work well. He 
approaches the battle in a more 
orderly manner, strategically 
maneuvering like Easy Company 
on war mini-series "Band of 
Brothers"i tackling has proved to 
be an effective tactic for him. 

Most times he gets it. As he 
channel surfs , triumphant and 
bloodied, r begin wheedling, 
negotiating for any sort of deal 
that means that I won't be viewing 
the la test documentary on the fas-
cinating world of airplane build-
ing on the Discovery Channel. He 
holds all the power, in the form of 
our remote courtesy of Time 
Warner Cable, yet he's listening. 

He's listening because we've 
learned the art of Television 
Diplomacy. 

It's a particular peacelceeping 
policy that makes our TV viewing 
habits resemble C-SPAN. It's an 
intriate dance that averts argu-
ments, ensures that I learn a bit 
about building some son: of vehicle, 
guarantees he finds out what digs 
the hippest mettosexuals are sport-
ing, and keeps us both sane. 

Thanks to Television 
Diplomacy, we can eat diMer 
together peacefully. It's bad enough 
that we watch 1V while we eat din-

ner on the bed, our sparkling din-
ner conversation sterruning from 
what's on the tube. All I ask is that 
I don't have to watch welding, a re-
run of "Sports Center," or anything 
to do with war while I eat. 
Likewise, I don't expect him to 
watch the terrifically awful pro-
gramming I love to hate. 

He takes a more intellectual 
approach to 1V; by the time I'm 
parked in frOnt of our off-brand 
picture-box, I'm aiming to slow 
down brain waves. He enjoys a fine 
episode of "How a Harley is Born" 
or a Histoty Channel instillment 
depicting war - any war. I'd rather 
spend my time with something 

" It's a jXDticular 
peacekeeping policy that 
makes our IV vieWng 

habits re.semlk C,SPAN." 
utterly mindless like the reality 
series "du jour." 

So, in the spirit of diplomacy, we 
compromise. To put it bluntly, I 
watch his crap so he'll watch mine, 

Really, he puts up with a lot 
when he consents to watching my 
selections. I don't even like the 
shows I'm watching, but it's quite 
fetching to despise .it. I claim that I 
am studying this or that reality 
series in the spirit of my communi-
cation major. If I'm desperate, I'll 
play the visual arts minor card and 
argue these shows are marvelous 
displays of performance art. But 
he's doing it for diplomatic reasons. 
He knows if he watches "Friends" 
with me, he's got leverage the next 
time "Junkyard Wars" is on. 

He's the Kofi Annan of our 
humble Paci6c Beach apartment. 

There are those! moments when 
we stumble on a show that is mutu-
ally agreeable. Those shows that 

live in the purgatory, where we each 
think they're not so bad but not so 
good, and that's just perfect. It's like 
an oasis in the culruralJy parched 
desert of our cable plan. 

For instance, I /mqw I've seen 
him chuckle at "Queer Eye for the 
Straight Guy," and he's not laugh-
ing at p1eadess golf-pants or tie-as-
a-bel t fashion mclcs, he's smiling 
because he's genuinely enjoying it. 
He does so covertly, however, as 
hel; usually occupied with dinner or 
a paper. And he was more than 
shocked when I watched the NFL 
draft with a peculiar interest. I 
played that off, asserting that I was 
only interested in seeing if anyone 
from my brother's collegiate foot-
ball team got dr",fted (there were, 
and I strangely and loudly rejoiced, 
losing my poker face for a 
moment). W", hold our cards close 
to our chest; in the spirit of 
Television Diplomacy, we're trying 
to keep the peace lind our own 
furure best interests in mind. 

I save all the really bad stuff, 
like "Baby Beauty Queens" until 
he falls asleep, anyway. I can han-
dle a little compromise when 
we're both awake. 

Television Diplomacy is not for 
the faint at heart. It takes supreme 
compromise, control and possibly 
physical contact when battling for 
the remote. 

And it pays off - we throw each 
other a bone once in awhile. Last 
Friday, he tossed a bag from Best 
Buy in my lap, contlining season 
five of "Sex and the City," which I 
recendy starred to watch. He does-
n't know it yet, but I shelled a few 
bucks on Amazon.com to purchase 
"The Band of Brothers" series that 
he's been coveting. The mini-series 
is being aired on television, but 1 
refuse to watch the re-runs on the 
History Channel while we dine on 
frozen pizza because it's just too 
damn violent. So, I just bought him 
theDVD set. 

He can wait until I'm asleep to 
watch it.

Earthquake: Sets beautifully 
represent different time periods 

continued from page I:J 
ity of the acting, givi ng the cast an 
air of humor even when they are 
attempting to depict serious situa-
tions. Some lines are so outra-
geously out of context that it 
might not be a bad idea for the 
theater to invest in a goed edi tor 
to revise the script. 

Despite the poor quality of the 
script, "Earthqualce Sun" is a visu-
al treat. Sets constantly change to 
represent the years 712, 2012 and 
3412. The transitions are very 
smooth, though, and the sets are 
appealing to the eyes. 

It is interesting to see Valdez's 
vision of the 34th century, which 
includes double helixes alluding 
to DNA both in props as well as in 
costumes. These two elements 
help reinforce Valdez's bleak pre-
diction that in the 34th century, 
humanity is only surviving 
through cloning after the ban of 
sex. A Mayan jungle in the 8th 
century is also well-represented 

artistically through elaborate 
props and costumes including 
hieroglyphs carved into wooden 
doors and intricate feathered 
headpieces. Special effects such as 
strobe lights and good sound 
effects add to the sci- Ii feel of this 
play and malc.e the transitions 
between Kan's time-traveling a lot 
smoother. 

Overall, "Earthquake Sun" 
should only be seen if there is noth-
ing else to do or if one wants to 
delight in innovative set design. 

The play is running through 
May 16 at the Lyceum stage in 
Horton Plaza in downtown an

Sunday nights are at 7 p.m. ; all 
other evening shows are at 8 p.m.,

Skynyrd. Best known for their 
down-south anthem 'Sweet

Duane Allman, Lynyrd Skynyrd are 
the quintessential Southern rock 
band. After a string of hit albums, 
the band faced tragedy in 1977 
when a small plane carrying the 
band members crashed, killing 
Ronnie Van Zant, Steve Gaines 
and Cassie Gaines. Ten years after 
the crash, the remaining mem-

The 31 st annual Adams

the mid- 1980s. Roots music 
embodied the forms of music 
that contributed to our modem 
forms of pop, . rock and jazz. In 
past years, the festival has 
brought a wide variety of music to 
San Diego, featuring everything 
from traditional folk to Celtic 
music. This year, the festival will 
feature Tomcat Courtney, Robin 
Henkel and the American Folk

"If you're feeling sinister/Go 
off and see a minister/He'll try in 
vain to take away the pain of 
being a hopeless unbeliever~ If 
nothing else, Belle & Sebastian 
are one of the more innovative 
bands out there today. The band 
hails from Glasgow, Scotland, and 
has a sound that can best be 
described as folk-meets-196Ds-
pop. The seven-piece band has 
an idiosyncratic style and is confi-
dent about doing things the way 
they want to. Though only 1,000 
copies of their first album 

Tigermilk were released, they 
soon gathered a huge following. 
Their Sllccess continued with sev-
eral other albums that were big in 
both the United States as weir as 
Europe, most recently Dear 
Catastrophe Waitress. Belle & 
Sebastian perform at Spreckels 
Theatre at 7 p.m. Tickets are 
$28.50. ® __ w~e-=dn;..;;..;esd;..;;;..;a;.L"y

Tritons take on UCSB, Chapman 
Women's crew improves on D-I rival Gauchos 

By MICHAEL SCHOECK 
Senior Staff Writer 

The UCSD women's crew 
team won one of six races in a 
three-way home m eet against 
UC Santa Barbara and Chapman 
University 011 April 24. 

" I think the varsity has done a 
great job continuing steady 
improvement, but the novices 
really came into their own at this 
regatta," UCSD head coach Patti 
Pinkerton said. 

UCSD picked up a victory 
over UCSB ill the second novice 
eight race, with the Tritons fin -
ishing more than 13 seconds 
ahead of the Gauch os in a time of 
8 minutes, 9.3 5 seconds . 

UCSB, however, was victori-
ous in the other five races. 
Chapman was notably underrep-
resented at the meet. 

"Unfortunately, Chapman did 
not have enough varsity mem-
bers to race , so it essentially 
turned out to be a dual [meet) 
against UCSB," senior Jennifer 
Watters said. 

UCSB won the varsity eight 
race in a time of 7: 13.1, while the 
Tritons posted a time of 7:24.6 
for second place. 

UCSD's losing gap was lower 
than the last time the Tritons and 
Gauchos squared off against each 
other. 

The same was true in the first 
novice eight race, which provid-

ed the closest margin of victory 
as all three teams competed. 

"The Ilovice eight was lead-
ing, but caught a rolling wake 
badly, and one of the rowers lost 
her oar," Pinkerton said. 

The Gauchos won the race 
with a time of 7:27.2, followed 
closely by the Tritons' mark of 
7:30.24. Chapman was left in the 
wake with its third-place time of 
8:37.19. 

"We were very aggressive 
during the race, and stayed with 
them for the first half of the 
race," Pinkerton said. 

However, UCSB inched away 
from the Triton boat when it

we fel! short, but I think we sti ll 
made UCSD look great." 

The dominant offensive per-
formance by the Tritons in their 
game against UC Davis was 
abse nt for the better pan of the 
first half ill the championship 
game. UCSD sh ot heavily, but 
the ball was going nowhere near 
[he cage. A man-up opportuniry 
was missed in the half. After giv-
ing an early goa l to Wright, the 
defen e shored up for most of 
the first period . But without a 
UCS D offellsive threat, goals 
from LMU's Stacia Peterson and 

arah Hamilton at the 2:47 and 
I :24 marks, respenively, gave 
the Liolls a cushion to ease into 
the contest. 

UCSD, on the other hand, 
had trouble adjusting to the pace 
of the game. Despite the starting 
lineup's experience, the majoriry 
of which played in the 2003 title 
game, the Tritons' nervousness 
was evident during warm- ups. 

"Because of our nerves and 
pressure to shoot better, every-
thing wasn't going in," UCSD 
senior goaltender Stephanie 
Lombardo said. "Lots of shot 
were going over the cage, even in 
warm-ups. The way you warm 
up IS the way you're going to 
play the game." 

Any pressure that the cold 

shooting might have missed , was 
certainly made up by the hot 
home crowd. The shouts stream-
ing from the largely pro-LMU 
attendance made it difficult for 
the Tritons to ease into a shoot-
ing streak. Lombardo recalled 
spending parts of the second half 
with the LMU men's water polo 
team jeering behind her goal. 

" It 's always tough playing 
down at the half, but with the 
men's team sitting over the cage 
... their rooting and cheering 
wasn't the easiest to listen to," 
Lombardo said. 

T he jeers of the LMU home 
crowd provided a spark to Start 
the fire in the 'Triton's game. 
Midway through the third, 
Clevenger took a hard elbow to 
the face guarding WWPA MVP 
Devon Wright. The blow had 
enough power to knock 
Clevenger's tooth through her 
cheek, and caused the game to be 
stopped for severa l minutes while 
she received medical attention. 

In the midst of this, the LMU 
crowd applauded the brazen 
blow and the injury sustained by 
Clevellger. LM U parents were 
also standing up and cheering. 

"I don't remember too much 
because I was mostly in shock, 
but I know the crowd was cheer-
ing and Larry (Sanders) was 
yelling, 'This LMU crowd has 

real class' while I was being 
attended to," Clevenger said. "I 
gOt help from the trainers, . but I 
wanted to get back in the game 
as soon as possible." 

Clevenger needed seven 
stitches to close the cheek 
wound, but that would have to 
wait until she finished the game. 
Clevenger was taped up by the 
trainers, returned to action, and 
hopped in on a 6-on-5 attack, 
striking a blow of her own with 
the power-play goal to follow 
Wong's success. 

"We did a good job to try and 
fight back," Sanders said . " I 
could tell because the other 
coach [LMU's John Loughran) 
was screaming at the referees, 
trying to challenge anything." 

T he efforts of Clevenger and 
her teammates didn't go unno-
ticed. Along with garnering the 
runner-up honors for the second 
year in a row, four Tritons were 
named to WWPA All-
Confe rence teams. Bantilan-
Smith and Lombardo earned 
fi rst- team honors while 
Clevenger and Wong were hon-
orable -mention selections. 

Four LMU players earned 
all -WWPA honors, plus the 
Lions head coach John 
Loughran was named WWPA 
coach of the yea r for the fourth 
consecutive year.

junior second baseman Ricky 
Pinocchio doubled, Chico State 
replaced junior sta rter Mike Jones 
on the mound with left-handed 
relief ace Robert Anaya. The 
Tritons got two runs back on an 
RBI ground out by junior leftfield-
er Joel Clark and a single up the 
middle by junior shortStop Keith 
Hernandez to make it a 7-5 ball 
game in the eighth inning. 

Senior centerfielder Brett 
Burton, who had a pair of two-run 
triples on April 24 and already 
collected two hits on the day, 
came through with a two-run sin-
gle through the left side of the 
infi eld to knot it at seven runs 
apiece. 

"1 think today's win was a per-
fect example of oW' emphasis that 
anybody on any given day can step 
up for this team ," UCSD head 
coach Dan O'Brien said. " Brett 
(Burton) was injured for a while, 
and as soon as he came off the 
[disabled list], he stepped in right 
away and started acting like a 
fifth -year senior and had a big 
weekend for us." 

Tied at 7-7 in the bottom of 
thc ninth, Burton drew a four-
pitch walk with one out. Junior 
designated hitte r Brian Robinson 

came back from an 0-2 count and 
singled through the left side of the 
infield to put Burton at second, 
representing the winning run . 

Trump, who successfully got-
ten on base in each of his first six 
at-bats after red-shirting a year 
ago, came on as a pinch hitter and 
belted the first pitch he saw off the 
center-field fence . He is now 7-
for- 13 on the year with five runs, 
four RBI and a .769 slugging per-
centage. 

"This win is huge," O'Brien 
said. "We try not to worry about 
things in the conference that are out 
of our control, but we needed to get 
at least a split this weekend to stay 
eligible for the NCAA tournament. 
We want to get to the conference 
townament, but we're here to win a 
CoUege World Series and [we could 
not have done) that without at least 
a split this weekend." 

UCSD junior pitcher Shlomo 
Lipett, who went on the mound 
for the final three illllings, picked 
up the win in relitf of senior 
starter Raf Bergstrom, improving 
to a perfect 4-0 on the year in his 
first season in the program. 
Bergstrom was effective over six 
innings, allowing seven hits, twO 
earned runs and three walles. 

Burton finished 3-for-4 with a 

double, a walk, two runs, two RBI 
alvl a steal. Senior catcher Jeff 
Riddle was 2-for-4 with a home 
run to : ~ad off the fourth inning, 
his fourth on the year. He also had 
two runs scorer! and two runs dri-
ven in. Robinson was 2-for-4 with 
an RBI single, and Pinocchio 
crossed the plate twice. 

The win puts UCSD's record 
at 30-2 1 overall and 19-17 in the 
CCAA. This maries the second 
time in O 'Brien's seven years that 
the Tritons have reached the 30-
win mark for a season. The first 
was in 2002 when UCSD went 
30-23-1. The victory also gave 
UCSD its 20th home win of the 
2004 campaign. 

The win and the series split put 
UCSD into a tie for fourth place 
with San Francisco State 
University in the CCAA. With the 
top four teams going to the CCAA 
conference tournament, each 
game that the Tritons play in the 
final series of 2004 at Cal State 
Stanislaus between April 30 and 
May 2, at Turlock Stadium in 
Stanislaus, Calif, will be of the 
utmost importance. As long as the 
Tritons' record in the last games is 
better than that of San Francisco 
State's, the Tritons will capture 
the playoff berth. 

Softball: No.2 Tritons have 
two more chances at SFSU 

cominW!d from page 20 
and saw her record drop to 13-11 
overall. 

UCSD brought a run home in 
the fourth inning, bringing the 
score to 7 -1. The Coyotes had 
exploded in a five-run second 
inning and added two more runs in 
the third. The Tritons scored twice 
in the sixth, but Cal State San 
Bernardino had added another run 
in the fourth and tacked on its final 
insurance run in the bottom of the 
sixth, putting the game at its final 
score of 9-3. Sophomore outfield-
er Jenny Spencer had a double and 
senior second baseman Kim 
Aggabao knocked out a triple for 
UCSD. 

The Tritons suffered another 
one-run defeat in their second 
game on April 24, losing 1-0 to 
Western New Mexico. Rowe was 
working 011 a shutout into the sev-
enth inning, but with two outs, 
Western New Mexico was able to 
squeak in a run . UCSO's bats 
remained silent in the bottom of 
the sevellth . Rowe suffered her 
seventh loss of the season, and her 
record dropped to 10-7. The 
Tritons managed five hits, but 
couldn 't complete a run. 

UCSD finally snapped out of 
its rut in the first game of the day 
on April 25 and was able to win its 
play-in game against Cal State 
Stanislaus in single-elimination 
playoffs, 6-2 . Cal State Stanislaus 
jumped out to a 2-0 lead in the sec-
ond inning against freshman 
suTter Rowe, neither run earned, 
but that was all Cal State 
Stanislaus would score for the day. 
Rowe gained her II th win of the 
seaSOll, raising her record to 11 -7 
on the season. 

The Triton's offensive funk 
ended in the third inning, when 

they exploded with five runs and 
added another in the sixth to bring 
the game up to its final score, 6-2 . 
Spencer led the offense for UCSD, 
going 2-for-3, scoring twice and 
netting an RBI off her second 
home run of the season. Aggabao 
and junior first baseman Jamie 
Hurst both went 1-for-3 on the 
day, adding both a run and an RBI 
each. Franciscus and Bland both 
scored for the Tritons as well, 
while freshman catcher Nikki 
Palmer drove in an RBI. 

Continuing their bad luck after 
a brief reprieve, the Tritons were 
pitted up against soon-to-be tour-
nament champions San Francisco 
State. Bryant had a rocky first 
inning, giving up three runs in 
two-thirds innings of work and, 
lacking any run support, took the 
loss, her fifth of the season. Bland 
pitched five and one-third innings 
in relief, gave up four earned runs, 
all in the sixth inning, and earned a 
no-decision. 

UCSD managed five b~, two 
coming from Aggabao, who, lIpon 
entering the tournament, was the 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association's leading hitter. She 
went 2-for-3 , Spencer and Bland 
both went l -for-3, and Anderson 
went l -for-2. All three players 
knocked in singles. 

The Tritons will return to the 
field when they playa doublehead-
er against CCAA rival Sonoma 
State on April 30 in Rohnert Park, 
Calif. On May I, the softball team 
will square off against San 
Francisco State for another dou-
bleheader. If the Tritons are able 
to match the SFSU record during 
the Sonoma State series, then 
sweep San Francisco State. UCSD 
will move into first place in the 
CCAA.

continued from page 20 
The Triton's improvement, 

despite laclcing a key component of 
the eight-man squad, demonstrates 
the definite threat that UCSD 
poses against rival tearns. 

"~re were rowing in a lineup 
that we had only tried once before 
the race," Carriker said, "but it 
worked out fine ." . 

The Tritons' varsity eight out-
stroked San Diego State, which fin-
ished third in 6:24.9, by more than 

" 

junior," Davis said. "But the sopho-
more and junior are borh second-
year rowers." 

The Tritons' novice eight fin-
ished the April 2 5 race in fourth 
place in a field of six boats with a 
time of 6:44.7, 15.1 seconds behind 
heat-winner USC, which finished in 
6:29.6. The novice team is seeded 
sixth in its WIRA heat for the May I 
and May 2 regatta. 

"Our novice boat has been 
showing a lot of 

five seconds. UC 
Irvine took fourth 
in the closel y 
matched heat, fol-
lowed by UCSB 
and UCLA in fifth 
and sixth place, 
respectively. 

UCSD's men's 
crew program has 
developed steadily 
this season, as the 
junior varsity and 
novice rowers are

improvement this 
season," Davis 
said. "I think that 
they can probably 
finish in the top 
four [at the WIRA 
regatta) . " 

All three teams 
have cut back their 
practice schedules 
slightly in order to 
prepare for the 
upcoming WIRA 

demonstrating that they, too, are a 
viable threat. 

At the Newport Regatta, the JV 
eight finished second to OCC, 
posting a time of 6:25.9 to the 
Pirates' 6:19.5. 

"We gained about 10 seconds [on 
OCC) in the]V nee," Davis said. 

This improvement lands the 
hlllior varsity boat in striking dis-
tance of the top-seeded OCC 
team. 

"Our ]V boat is seeded fifth [at 
the WIRA Championships), but I 
think we can definitely finish in the 
top three if they race to their 
potential," Davis said. 

The Tritons have a remarkably 
young team considering how com-
petitive their race times are. 

"The JV boat is made up of six 
freshmen, one sophomore and a 

Championships. 
"The teams are tapering this 

week," Davis said. "We're drop-
ping the volume of practices, but 
the intensity is picking up." 

The Tritons are ready to cap off 
the 2004 WIRA conference season 
in style. 

"We want to give [OCC, UC 
Davis and Gonzaga] a run for 
their money," Carriker said. 
"We're feeling good, we have a 
fast lineup anc, assuming that the 
weather is calm, it's going to be a 
fast race." 

After the May I and May 2 
WlRA Championship regatta, the 
Tritons will travel to Worcester, 
Mass., to compete at the East Coast 
Athletic Conference National 
Invitational Regatta on May 8 to 
partake in the national champi-
onships.

The UCSO dancesport team 

completed its undefeated season 
with another victory at the UNLV 
Desert Challenge. in Las Vegas, 
held April 24 and April 25. UCSD's 
two teams took first and second 
place out of six teams. 

"It was the best performance 
I've seen from the team all year," 
UCSD coach Peter Edwards said. 

Not only were the formation 
teams successful, but couples com-
petitors from UCSD placed in the 
top six couples in nearly every event 

Individual winners included 
Oleg Asanbayev and freshmanJulie 
Wall, who placed second in Bronze

The UCSD 
women's lacrosse team hosted 

the Western Women's Lacrosse 
League playoffs on April 24 and 
April 25 at Warren and Spanos 
Field. It was the first time it had 
hosted the event in nearly five years 
and the fourth time hosting in the 
league's history. 

The Tritons entered the play-
offs looking solid·afrer finishing off 
·their regular season with a pair of 
wins over Loyola Marymount and 
Pomona-Pitzer. Among the eight 
Division I teams vying for the 

championship, UCSD was ranked 
sixth. This playoff appearance was 
the first for UCSD since entering 
the highly competitive Division I 
league. 

Unfortunately, UCSD lost both 
of its matches on April 24, elimi-
nating the team from a run at the 
title. Facing a large and organized 
team from Santa Clara University 
in the opening round, the Tritons 
couldn't seem to find their rhythm. 
They faced a similar uphill battle 
against UCSB in the consolation 
bncket. Results of the game were 
unavailable at press time. 

The women's lacrosse team 
improved since last year, trans-
forming itself from a faltering team 
into a playoff contender in the 
course of a single season. Although 
this season maries the end for one 
graduating senior, the high-scoring 
Elaine Lui, the team is looking very 
strong for next year.

sophomore Katie Murray, junior 
Christine King and freshmen 
Katie Kilduff, Megan Hagquist, 
Leab Llach, Dana Hunt and Darn

Although the outgoing tide 
slowed things down a little, the 
race was stiU swift and strong, and 
the team was content with the 
improvement over UCSB. 

"As it was, across the board we 

improved about two boat-lengths 
on [UCSB)," Pinkerton said. 

At the Marcil 27 Berg Cup, 
UCSB won all silt races, but 
UCSO's strong recent results 
indicate that the team bas been 
able to close the gap as the result 
of an extensive workout schedule. 

"We've been in our overload

It was the lISt home race for 
the Tritons' five four-year ath-

Watters and Liz Jones, along with 
Stefanie Barriere, Alexis Kleckner 

and coxswain Claire Romelfanger. 
The tri-meet was also the last

WWP A Championship Albrecht's 10th-inning home run seals win 

By COURTNEY FIELD 
Senior Staff Writer 

On April 23, the UCSD base-
balI team kicked off a crucial four-
game series against ClUco State 
with a heroic game-winning home 
run from senior first baseman 
Keith Albrecht in the bottom of 
the lOth inning. The final score of 
game one was 5-4.

Ace in the dutch: Jose Navarro gave up four earned runs on seven hits and 
one walk while striking out three in the Tritons' 5-4, lO·inning victory on April 23. 

The Wildcats avenged the 
loss, sweeping the doubleheader 
on April 24, 5-4 and 5-3, respec-
tively. 

UCSD entered game four on 
April 25 needing a victory to keep 
their playoff hopes alive. The 
Tritons rallied from a four-run 
deficit to earn an 8-7 victory and 
maintain their fourth place tie with 
San Francisco State. 

In the April 25 game, with run-
ners on first and second, UCSD 
red-shirt freshman pinch hitter 
Brian Trump took the first toss 
from Wildcat pitcher Nick Burger 
and knocked a double off the cen-
ter-field wall with one out in the 
bottom of the ninth inning. This 
was enough to lift the Tritons to 
the crucial victory. 

"It was a good feeling," fresh-
man firstbaseman Brian Trump 
said. "I was ready the whole game 
and was just trying to keep my 
mind focused . I had a feeling that 
it was going to be a first-pitch fast-
balI because that's what he had 
been throwing. I was just sitting on 
that pitch and saw it." 

The Tritons were trailing the 
Wildcats, 7-3, in the bottom of the 
seventh inning. UCSD junior right-
fielder Ryan Langone reached on an

topple hosts and WWPA kingpins 
Loyola Marymount, falling in the 
April 24 finals for the third con-
secutive year, 7-3. 

For Loyola Marymount, the 
win meant it's fourth trip to the 
National Collegiate Athletic 
Association Final Four. For the 
Tritons, who finished the 2004 
regular season with a 15-20 
record, it was another failed 
attempt to end LMU's WWPA 
dominance and its own champi-
onship drought. After putting up 
a fO\lr-game winning streak and 
successfully spreading its offense, 
UCSD entered the game knowing 
it had a chance to challenge the 
Lions. 

But in a game where near-per-
fection was needed, the Tritons 
battled pre-game jitters and a 
hostile and boisterous home 
crowd. Mistakes were few and 
minor, but enough for the Lions 
to pounce and race out to a 5-0 
advantage by the third period, led 
by Devon Wright'S pair of scores. 

The Tritons managed to fight 
off the butterflies and screaming 
fans enough to muster a late, two-
goal third-quarter run. Junior dri-

Men's crew anxious for 
WIRA Grand Finals 

Tritons gain time on top-seed 
Orange Coast College 

Softball doesn't Ido the Dew' 

By MAnHEW GRANT 
Associate Sports Editor 

Somebody better tell the 
Orange Coast College men's varsi-
ty eight crew team to look out 
behind them, because UCSD is 
catching up fas t. T he Tritons 
entered the Newport Regatta on 
April 25 determined to undermine 
the 8.SS-second advantage OCC 
boasted at the April 4 San Diego 
City CharnpionslUp Grand Final 
race. T he result was a blazing-fast 
UCSD boat that cut the Pirates' 
lead to 4.1 seconds, as the Tritons 
completed the 2,000-meter course 
in 6 minutes, 19.1 seconds under 
near-perfect conditions at Newport 
Harbor, Calif. 

"[OCC] has a really fast start," 
freshman Brenden Carriker said. 
"After that, we just pretty much 
stayed close. We didn't let them 
walk all over us." 

The improvement gives UCSD 
a great shot at winning the Western 
Intercollegiate Rowing Association 
Championship race on May 2, 
where the boat will again face OCC 
and other division rivals UC Davis 
and Gonzaga. 

"The varsity eight is seeded 
third behind OCC, which is first, 
and UC Davis," head coach Mark 
Davis said. "Gonzaga is seeded 
fourth, but any of those four can 

win [the Grand Finals) because 
there is not a lot of difference in the 
speed between them." 

The Tritons have confidence in 
their ability to compete in the May 
2 race on Lake Natoma in 
Sacramento, Calif., when the team 
wilI be fully tapered and in top 
form. 

"[On April 25) we improved 
about five seconds, but one of our 
varsity eight rowers was sick, so we 
are probably faster than we 
showed," Davis said. 

Sophomore stroke seat Todd 
Myer missed the April 25 race due to 
illness, wlUch caused the Tritons to 
have to rearrange the rowers. 
Because the stroke seat is the eighth 
position in the boat, closest to the 
coxswain at the stem, all of the seven 
rowers belUnd the stroke seat base 
the rhythm of their strokes off of his 
rate. 

To compensate for the absence 
of Myer, Davis moved freshman 
Michael Zurko from the junior var-
sity boat to the varsity eight, and 
switched sophomore co-captain 
Eric Kuhle to the stroke seat. 

"[Zurko] performed very well," 
senior co-captain Eric Hardeman 
said. "We weren't any slower. I 
thought we stepped up to the chal-
lenge really well."

Tritons go 1-5, drop three single-run games 
By JOE SPANO 
Senior Staff Writer 

UCSD competed in the 18th 
annual Cal State Bakersfield 
Mountain Dew Classic held in 
Bakersfield, Calif., on April 23 
through April 25 . The Tritons 
dropped all four of their games 
and went 1-1 in the single-elimi-
nation playoffs, losing to tourna-
ment champions San Francisco 
State in the quarterfinals. 

The Tritons couldn't catch a 
break in the tournament. It began 
with the early game on April 23, 
with a 3-2 loss to Grand Canyon 
University. Despite jumping out 
to a two-run lead in the top of the 
first inning, UCSD's lead was 
fleeting. Grand Canyon scored 
two in the bottom of the first and 
once more in the fifth. 

Freshman pitcher Tma Rowe, 
who was on a three-game win-
ning streak, lost her sixth game of 
the season, putting her record at 
10-6. The Tritons had two hits on 
the day, including a double by 
sophomore shortstop Desiree 
Franciscus. 

The second game on April 23 
found UCSD suffering a difficult 
defeat at the hands of tourna-
ment host Cal State Bakersfield, 
losing 9-8 in nine innings. Junior 
Kelley Bryant, pitching in relief 
for senior starter Jodie Bland, suf-
fered the loss, bringing her over-
all record to 3-4 on the year. 

UCSD once again jumped to

an early lead, scoring once in the 
first inning. But by the sixth 
inning, the Roadrunners were 
leading 8-1. The Tritons put 
together a solid sixth inning, 
posting seven runs and seemingly 
shifting the momentum to their 
side. Hits included a double by 
sophomore rightfielder Niki 
Anderson and a triple from senior 
third baseman Amy Mettee. The 
Roadrunnen, however, managed 
to hold the Tritons in ema 
innings and put one run on the 
board in the bottom of the ninth 

to win. 
Since the Tritons lost both of 

their games, they entered the 
bronze pool of the tournament, 
hoping to emerge victorious 
against the other two teams who 
had also lost both of their first 
games. 

Cal State San Bernardino had 
other ideas, however, and beat the 
Tritons by a score of 9-3 in the 
early game on April 24. Bland 
took her 11 th loa of the season
