Finding New 
Students Top 
Priority Here 
Declining Enrollment 
Threatens UCSD Funding 

By Cindy Beveridge 
Staff Writer 

An a nticipated drop in student enrollme nt in the 
near future emphasizes the need to implement 
new programs to advance recuitment, Chancellor 
MdJroy told the Academic Senate in their first 
meeting of the year last night. 

"The toughest problem facing the universi ty 
right now" was treated with a variety of • 
suggestions by the chancellor aime~ at 
maintaining the present rate of enrollment. 

The drop is expected to occur as a result of a 
decline in the nationwide college-age population, 
limiting the number of a pplicants to secondary 
institutions. 

.. A more aggressive program in our recruitment 
procedure is necessary ," MdJroy said. "We need 
to retain our .present student population until 
enrollment again takes an upward swing," he said. 

A Senate commillee responsible for assessing 
the effects of the projected decline will continue to 
investigate recruitme nt programs described by the 
cha'ncellor. The committee is composed of one 
student, two members of the Senate, and two vice 
presidents. 

Declining enrollment decreases the a mount of 
money allocated to the university by the state. 

Decreasetl student enrollme nt is particularly 
important as the 1978·1979 budget reached an 
"all -time high" of 247 million, according to

Del Mar Planning Legal Fig~t Against 
North City West DevelopDlent Report 

By Kathy Huffer 
Associate News Editor 

'[he City ' of Del Mar is racing 
against time in an a ttempt to a t least 
postpone future construction of the 
recently -approved North City W est 
development. 

In a special meeting last night , the 
Del Mar City Council voted to seek 
court action against the City of San 
Diego, whose counci l approved the 
first phase of the North City West on 
Monday . Such a move must be 
made by Nov,S. when their lega l 
right to litigate expires, 

"We're serious, a nd we feel that 
we 're right," Del Mar Mayor AI 
Tarington said after the council. 
emerged from a two·hour long 
dosed session. 

Council members agreed to 
withhold det<lils of their strategy 
until a t least next Monday night, 
when they will discuss more specific 
plans for a lawsuit. 

There are six or seven forms of 
litiga tion avai lahle to Del Mar. 
Council m mb er H e rv ey 
Sweet wood said after the meeting. 

While he would not go into detail. 
Sweet wood said the t:Ouncil will 
probably attempt litigation on both 
environmental and economic 
grounds . 

Sweet wood also indicated that 
the council's primary objective is to 
"slow the rate of growth." adding 
that members want to increas the 
span of yei.1rs designated for 
development of North City W e st's 
nine phases. 

But weetwood did not discount 
the possibility of s toppin g 
development altogether. "Our 
options a re from stopping it in its 
tracks ... to seei ng nothing happen at 
all, " he commented, 

The counci l has a t its disposal 
"hundreds of thousands of dollars" 
in a reserve fund that could be used 
for legal 'osts, weetwood said. But 
.Jthough the t:Ouncil has saved 
money, weetwood said they would 
not necessarily spend the entire 
fund. 

Community me mbers in ,the 
North County area wi ll also be 
urged to contrihutl' fllnds for the 

lawsuit, according to Sweetwood. 
Del Mar resident JoseJ}h Lang. 

who spoke brie fly before the council 
lJegan its private deliberations . said 
he found through a "casual po"" 
that some Del Mar citizens were 
willing to donate $100 each toward 
court action. "People are willing to 
put their money where their mouth 
is," he said. 

The counci l may combine their 
legal effort s with the Coalition for 
Responsible Planning, a ci ti zen 
adion group bast'<) in Del Mar tha t 
tried to prevent approval of North 
City West. The C!Ja lition has said in 
the past it would seek court a ·tion 
against the development. 

" It 's been discussed." ' weetwood 
said of a possible joint effort. .. As 
individuals, counctl members are 
very dose to some of the memb rs 
of the coalition . We will havea lot of 
areas of agreement."

Beyond Slogans 
There are signs around campus, mainly on walls and kiosks, 

that this fall's progressive buzz words will be "Democratize the 
Regents." According to a flyer, "people power" is being put to 
use. starting with a mass meeting next Monday. to support an 
amendment to the state constitution that would change the 
appointed Board orRegents to a popularly elected Board of 
Regents. 

The supporters of this campaign may be falling prey to the 
notion that more voting means more !IOCial justice. If they have 
thought beyond the composition of their slogan. they are no 
doubt counting on the occasional sophistication of the 
California electorate - which defeated anti-gay and 
antismoking industry propositions on the same ballot last year 
-to differentiate between their individual int~rests in paying 
fewer taxes and their collective interests in a first-rate 
university. That is a dangerous jump to make. 

lt is hard to imagine a more frightening tableau than a 
collection of self·styled'laxpayers' advocates taking advantage 
of a Regents' election to bring the "Spirit of Proposition 13" to 
the University of California . II the trend in election~ for 
elementary and high school and community college district 
trustees is any indication. we would get back.to-basii:s 
candidates, candidates who would use William Proxmire 
techniques to ridicule university research projects, candidates 
who would turn reading lists for political philosophy courses 
into anti·Communist sloBans. "Do you know what they call 
music up at UCSD?" a Regent candidate who happened on a 
newspaper feature about our experimental music department 
would tell a Rotary Club meeting. ''They use computers and 
old tires ark! do things with their voices that makes 'em lIOund 
like geese in a blender." 

Much of what a mOdern research university does could be 
made to sound nothing short 01 silly by a good rhetorician. He 
would have a field day with research prolP'ams whose value is 
only understood by scholars or by the researchers conducting 
them. This is not to say that voters aren't illtelligent enough to 
make general judg,ements about issues, but candidate!! can 
manipulate information about complex subjects to t~1I 
whatever story they want. An example w'as the barely 
unsuccessful witch-hunt last year against state Supreme Court 
justice Rose Bird, which was based on distorted, out-of-context 
excerpts from complicated legal opinions. 

No political scientist would inllist that voters have acceu to 
enough inlormation to make intelligent choices about all the 
illllues that shape society; the solution that has been devised 
over time is a balance of pow~r among elected and appointed 
officers. That system protects UC Irom excessive politic.'al 
tampering by placing lhe state Legislature between the Regents 
and the voters. Local IIchool boards ar~ elected, but volumes of 
state-mandHted regulations and policies insur~ that no local 
hoard could reinaugurate the 19th Century , But UC has 
carefully protected its semi·autonomy from slate lawmaking; a 
popularly·elected colleelion of yahoos could have a field day 
rearranging things. ' 

The need to create electoral constituencies, which Regents 
appointed by governors do not have. would make Regents and 
Regent candidates as interested in headlines, and in 
appearing to be constantly active, as other politicians. They 
would divide up the electorate into ideological bailiwicks 'and 

would bring into public discussion many issues the organizers 
of the "Democratize the Regents" movement would prefer 

w~re left oul. I'd hate to think what would happen to affirmative 
aelion if it WHS sul~eeled to the same electoral impulses that are 
pulling anti-busing candidates on school boards in Loa Angeles 
and San ~iego. The iSllues aren't lIimilar, but a good politician 
could easily hlur the distindions. 

Supportets of the drive will maintain that it would he beller to 
have Regents rellponllihle to voters instead 01 to the Imlliness 
community. from which many of them are drawn (this ildells 
true under Gov. Hrown that it wall under Gov. Rea",an). But I 
imagine thHt th~ iSIIIJe!I ov~r which a businellsman would m011l 
likely vote like i1 busineurnan, such as UC's investment 
portfolio. are beyond the information and interellt of molit 
voters. Other issues like campus collective 
bargaining, remain within the jurisdielion of the IItHt~ 
Leuislature. ' 

For forces that ci111 themselves progrellsive to initiHte any 
movement to further "democratize" anything - that is. 
provide elections where b~fore ther~ were none - ill to ignore 
the widely reco",nized electoral backlallh against governm~nt 
and public spending. II a Oemcx:ratic US Con!{ress can dillcuss

liberal state Ass~mbly speaker (Leo McCarthy) ("vms a

Ineligible Play-er in Cheap Underwt;Jter Shots 

1M Wa~er 'Polo Dynasty Ends in Disgrace 
By Jon Goetz 
Sports Editor 

' Ine coed innertube water 
polo season stands at its 
midway point but for the 
Underwater Cheap Shots, a ' 
team with more experience 
than the rest of the Ieag-ue put 
together, the 1979 season is 
over . 

i,1tramural czar Mike Hipp 
booted the team out of the . 
leagu~ after Scott Berndes, a 
('o·coordinator of intramural 

athletics , forced Cheap Shot 
memlJt!r Jeff Wustman to 
admit he had lied about his 
affiliation with the University 
to illegally obtain a Recreation 
Privilege card (the card is 
required for all non ·students 
who play intramurals) . 

The team also used a nothe r 
ille!-(al player in their game 
Sunday night , wh!ch the 
Cheap Shoh; won 9-·5 with 
only five players i~he pool 
(six is usual). ' Ineir opponents 

also use<l an illegal piayer in 
tha t !-tame, :n exchange for 
allowing the Cheap Shots an 
extra player. 

Their ejection from the 
league halts a new dynasly 
team captain Mike Tom was 
hoping to build. The Cheap 
Shots have won five 

. championships since the 
inception of the sport at 
UCSD. They are practically a 
living hi s tory of the sport as 
played here. 

. c....-..-. .-
The soccer team struck early against USIU Monday, but then gave up three goals in a J.llon. 
Bill Bullock scored first on a cornerkick from Bruce Logan. USIU tied the score late in the fint 

half. went ahead in the OIecond period off a direct kick. and added another goal later in the game. 
Nonetheless, coach Stewart Hayes called the contest "the most encouraging game" of late. as tho: 

offense has been starting to work together to form ., potent threat . UII'A the amount of time we've 
practiced," sayK Hayes. "We've had !!OITIe IIOrt of double session a ll !leason long." 

'Ibi~ is the right time of the !leaSOIl to peak, as ptayoff time approaches. A win in either of the 
Iwxt two RameAagainst Biola and Azusa Pacific shou ld putt~ Tritons into NAIA poAt-season play.

ORGANIZATIONAL MEETING 
WEDNESDA Y, OCTOBER 24th 

4:00-5:30 PM 
IN THE 

NORTH CONFERENCE ROOM 
OF THE 

STUDENT CENTER 

'lney ended up winning 
most of their games, and the 
athleles that started with the 
squad stayed wilh it. Tobi 
Delong played with them for 
four years , then studied at UC 
San Francisco and played for 
a leam there. This year she 
returned to UCSD on an 
exchange program, and 
rejoined the leam, scoring 
m a ny of their goals with her 
strong arm. 

The Cheap Shots picked up 
inte rcollegia te water polo 
coach Russ Hafferkamp this 
year, adding his international 
waler polo playing experience, 
to their advantage . Some of 
the team members have also · 
been to the AII·Cals and 
regional championships of 
innertube waler polo. 

Yet the team is gone now, 
clearing the way for a probable 

leagu~ sweep by Dan Ehy's 
SKLIF team and a sure trip to 
post·season play . 

SKLIF has some of the best 
a thletes 'of the water polo and 
swimming pro g rams at 
UCSD, and has a 3·0 record 
this season. Eby and Claudia 
O ' Brien both play inten:olleg· 
iate water polo , Scott Hinman 
is an assistant coach of the 

~ater polo team, and Joe 
Hernandez was among the top 
freestylers in last spring's 

NAIA championships. 
Eby can hit the corners of 

the goal from eight yards out. 
Hinma n, a lormer junior 
college All· American, still has 
a fast backhand shot. 

O'Brien, playing Sunday 
with a fiberglass cast on her 
left hand, utilized her good 
hand fo r several mid-court 
steals and at least two goals in 
their 12·9 win over the 
Squeaky Rubbers. 

Hernandez glide.s down the 
pool quickly and smoothly, 

. notably better than the choppy 
swimming style of most 
players. 

SKU F should benefit from 
the Cheap Underwater Shot's 
demise, but they still face 
competition from the other two 
AA leagues. Destiny, 
captained by high.scoring Joe 
Davis, also has a shot at lhe 
championship. 

Davis and women's 
• swimmer Nadine Thompson 

have helped propel the team to 
a 2·0 record, only allowing 
one goal and scoring 44 points 
themselves. Destiny is the 
favorite to win their league, but 
the S&M's and the A.S. 
Holes, also undefeated , will try 
to spoil their chance. 

lne Polo Bears also have 
an outside charic:.e at the AA 
Title. 

Erratum 
The Dail!J Guardian erroneously reported yesterday that 

the UCSD water polo team lost 10 Cal State Los Angeles in a 
tournament played in San Salvador. In fact , the team rarely 
travels to exotic Latin American nations to play water polo. 
The farthest they have gone for a game this year is Claremont, 
considerably closer to home , where they played CSLA.

Dylan's Train Derails 
By Ted Burke 

Art. Editor 
A friend recently tried to 

convince me that the outright 
religiosity .on Dylan's new 
Slow Train Coming (the 
" born -ag a in " vari e ty, 
America's foremost pockmark 
on anything spiritual) was 
valid because Bob the Bard 
had a lways used theological , 
• pe c ifi c ally Biblical , 
refe rences in his lyrics. 

True enough, I conceded, 
Dylan made a lot of use of the 
Bible in hi. much of it 

brilliant, ra nging from the 
prophe lic sounding spiril -
rousers of " When Our Ship 
Comea In" and "Chimes of 
Freedom" a ll the way to the 
spare, backwoods ve rse on 
John Wesley Harding . When 
he was working in his besl 
fonn , Dylan would adopt the 
skeletal cadence of the Good 
Book and would transform it 
into something else, a molif 
that could sustain a writer 
coming to grips with g rowing 
up absurd , the plight of the 

individua l sean:hing for values 
in a n age that's le t itself be

surreali s tic impression of a 
consciousness tha t 's bee n

Dyla n , of (Ourse, had other 
linguis tic ploys: purposeful use 
of c lic he . hype rlro phic

b ibli ca l cad e n ce, Dy la n 
di splayed a ta le nt fo r 
assuming a kind of voice a nd 
then tra nsfo rming it into 
something else a ltogether. In 
his own way . Dyla n adhered to 
Pound 's t!dict to "make it 
new. His successes a re

Dyla n. however , is nol out

Slow Train Coming ·

Evangelical chest-thumpers, preswnes 
he can wipe everyone else's clean as 
well. 

What's most disheartening about 
Slow Train Coming isn't the fact that 
Dylan's got religion - there are millions 
of people who believe in God who are 
not fanatics and behave in ways anyone 
would consider rational - but the fact 
that the most original lyrical talent or 
rock and roll would produce this kind of 
warmed over, banal, cheap-shot gruel. 
This m"y, however, be the best that 
Dylan can give us at this time or anytime 
in the future. After an extended 
explosion of extraordinary work early in 
hi. career, (Another Side of Bob Dylan

Impact Report for NCW. 

in '63; John Wesley Harding in '68; a 
span of five years), it seems to me more 
obvious that Dylan has used up all of 
what he had, and had to spend the years 
after that trying to live his past down 
(what else could explain a travesty life 
Self Portrait). Slow Train Coming, 
then, is a warning to those who still have 
some semblance of a'brain at the end of 
the Me decade: be your own man or 
woman, but don't blow your wad all at 
once. lnere's still a lifetime to get 
.through. Dylan is the saddest example of 
what happens if you don't walch your 
step.

The subject of some debate within the center, it was chosen, representative

facti about forcing a poor woman to go for whatever means are available." 

"San Diego has cast the gaunt'et
