Secret Society 
Reveals Members 
DA VIS - Stunned by 
criticism from the UC Davis 
commun:ij', Sword and 
Sandals, a campus secret 
society, recently announced it 
will provide students with the 
opportunity to see its mem-
bership roster. "This is in 
response to people's ques-
tions about who is considered 
to have enough merit to be in. 
It 's a good way to show 
people that [the group isj not 
so elitist in nature," said 
member Wes Namikawa, who 
added that the group is 
currently accepting applica-
tions for new members. The 
application process marks a 
change from the previous 
policy of individually inviting 
members to join Sword and 
Sandals. 

SDSU Population 
Reflects Diversity 
SAN DIEGO - The percent-
age of white students at San 
Diego State has decreased, 
while the percentage of 
minority students has 
increased over the last three 
years, according to a report 
conducted by the Department 
of Academic and Institutional 
Studies. "Colleges are 
starting to take a serious look 
at their makeup," said Gus 
Chavez, director of the SDSU 
Educational Opportunity 
Program. "Education is a 
business, and the change in 
the student population has 
created a new customer." 

Gov. Cuomo Dazzles 
Davis Audience 
DAVIS -In a speech that 
addressed the condition of the 
nation, New York Gov. Mario 
Cuomo spoke at UC Davis 
last week. "Americans 
understand that we're still the 
greatest nation the world has 
ever seen, but they feel less 
optimistic than they have in 
the past," the two-term 
governor told the crowd.

Court Drops Its Restriction on Tapes 
By PhIlip Michaels 
News Editor 

lic recordings of oral arguments 
made in 23 landmark cases over the 
last 35 years. 

be appropriate," the court said in a 
prepared statement. 

The showdown between UCSD 
Political Science Professor Peter 

. Irons and the U.S. Supreme Court 
came to an end last week when the 
court announced that it would drop 
its restrictions on tapes of oral ar-
guments made before the court. 

To get access to the tapes, Irons 
signed an agreement with the Na-
tional Archives that he would not 
duplicate, distribute or broadcast 
the tapes, an agreement which the 
professor promptly violated. Irons 
had argued that the agreement was 
non-binding and that the educa-
tional merits of the tapes out-
weighed the consequences of break-
ing his agreement with the archives. 

Last month, Wong, writing at 
the direction of Chief Justice Wil-
liam Rehnquist, said that the court 
would have to approve any future 
req uest by Irons to use the tapes. 

With lastweek'sannouncement, 
however, the court will no longer 
restrict access to the tapes. In addi-
tion, said court spokeswoman Toni 
House, the court would not pursue 
any further action against Irons. 

In a letter to the National Ar-
chives, Court Marshal Alfred Wong 
said that the archives should not 
place any restrictions on providing 
copies of the tapes. Since 1979, the 
court had banned the public distri-
bution or broadcast of the tapes. 

The debate over the tapes began 
when Irons published May It Please 
the COLI rt, a book and cassette pack-
age that made available to the pub-

In August, the court blasted 
Irons, accusing him of breach of 
contract. "In light of this clear vio-
lation of Professor Irons' contrac-
tual commitments, the court is con-
sidering what legal remedies may 

When reached for comment on 
the court' s reversal, Irons jokingly 
referred to the decision as '·craven 
capitulation."

u.s. Immigration Policy Criticized 
FORUM: Panelists call for 
UCSD students to join the fight 
for Chicano rights 
By Jennifer NIcoli 
Guardian Reporter 

At an open forum held last Tuesday at 
Peterson Hall , UCSD students and faculty 
discussed the reported abuse of Mexican and 
Chicano immigrants by the United States gov-
ernment. 

The forum, attended by approximately 75 
students and faculty, was organized by Voz 
Fro"teriza, the A.S.-funded Chicano news-
paper and sponsored by Movimiento 
Estudiantil Chicano de Azhin (MEChA) and 
the UCSD chapter of Chicano Concilio. 

UCSD History Professor David Gutierrez 
and Raza Rights Coalition Coordinator Paul 
Aceves spoke at the forum , accusing the U. S. 
government of making "Mexican immigrants 

, the scapegoat for all U.S. domestic prob-
lems." Both speakers also noted that the small 

turnout of students demonstrated the lack of 
public concern for the problems facing the 
Mexican community. 

Aceves spoke fervently as he outl ined the 
positions of the Raza Rights Coalition, a com-
munity-based organization that works for the 
rights of Mexicans and Chicanos, and urged 
immediate action from the Hispanic commu-
nity. 

Aceves said that the Raza Rights Coalition 
"does not recognize tht. U.S'/European impe-
rialist-created border." He also reiterated the 
coalition 's common phrase, "We didn·t cross 
the border, the border crossed us ." Aceves 
said that the coalition considers the border 
patrol to be a special police force, comparable 
to the Gestapo of Nazi Germany, whose ~ole 
purpose is to brutalize Mexican migrants. 

Gutierrezsaid the United States has a "myo-
pic" view of the problems facing Mexicans. 
He added that becau eofthe American media's 
portrayal of the "i llegal jmmigrant crisis,"

MeAnuff Will Reduee 
Role with Playhouse 
THEATRE: Tony Award-winning director will 
pursue other interests on stage and screen 
By Jonna Palmer 
Associate News Editor 

Des McAnuff, the guiding force 
at the La Jolla Playhouse since 
1982, will reduce his role there 
once the 1994 season concludes. 
The move comes as McAnuff is 
rumored to be on the verge of a 
multi-film deal with Disney Stu-
dios. 

Award for Best Director of a Mu-
sical. ''Tommy'' is currently in the 
middle of a national tour and on 
Broadway. McAnuff is preparing 
''Tommy'' for its London premiere. 

With help from McAnuffs ar-
tistic direction, the La Jolla Play-
house won the 1993 Tony Award 
for Outstanding American Re-

gional Theatre. 
The Playhouse has 
received over 200 
other major theatre 
awards during 
McAnuff's tenure. 

La Jolla Play-
house supporters 
and staff members 
reacted positively 
to the new arrange-
ment with 
McAnuff. "This is

Beginning in 
1995, McAnuffs 
title will be Direc-
tor-in-Residence at 
the Playhouse, 
meaning he will 
largely be able to 
come and go as he 
pleases. "La 10lla 
Playhouse will re-
main my home 
base," said 
McAnuff. " I wam 
to pursue additional 
directing and writ-
ing in the theatre 
and in films and, si-
multaneously, keep 
my close ties with

vision an ongoing 
relationship with

there and less on

President of the La 
Jolla Playhouse 
Board of Directors,

senior administra-
tive duties," McAnuff added. 

McAnuff signed on as artistic 
director of the Playhouse in 1982 
and has seen the theatre company 
through II seasonsofgrowingsuc-
cess si nce it reopened in 1983. 
During that time, both McAnuff 
and the Playhouse have gained na-
tional recognition several times. 

"Big River," a musical that pre-
miered at the Playhouse in 1985, 
went on to Broadway where it won 
Tony Awards for both McAnuff 
and for the show itself. In 1987, 

cAnuff directed Lee Blessing's 
"A Walk in the Woods," which 
was performed on Broadway, as 
well as in Russia and England. "A 
Walk in the Woods" received a 
Pulitzer Prize nomination. 

Most recently, McAnuff di-
rected, "The Who's Tommy," 
which he co-wrote with Who gui-
tarist Pete Townsend. For his ef-
forts, McAnuffwon the 1993 Tony 

approval of 
McAnuffs new position in the 
theatre company. " I'm delighted 
for the Playhouse to be entering a 
long-term relationship with 
[McAnuff] . For a long time, I've 
known that he has had more lucra-
tive offers, and the fact that he 
stayed has been a testament to his 
dedication to the Playhouse," said 
Dwyer. 

Vanderlaan said that the new 
relationship will be advantageous 
for everyone. "The Playhouse is 
the place where he will do the kind 
of theatre he wants to see pro-
duced. When [McAnuff] tooka50 
percent salary reduction to get us 
through some pretty turbulent eco-
nomic times this past season, it 
showed us his unselfish dedica-
tion. When I invited [McAnuff] to 
stay with the Playhouse in this 
new capacity, and he enthusiasti-
cally accepted, I was elltraordi-
narily pleased," Vanderlaan said.

Prince Receives Death Penalty 
Cleophus Prince. the "Clairemont Killer· convicted 

for the 1990 murders of six women in the Clairemont 
area, was sentenced to death in a San Diego court on 
Friday. 

"It Is the judgement and sentence of this court that 
the defendant, Cleophus Prince, shall be put to death, • 
said Superior Court Judge Charles Hayes when he 
announced the. punishment for each conviction. 

Before Hayes announced the sentences, Prince 
stood up and faced the relatives of the victims. "I did 
not kill any of [your] daughters. I feel pity inside for your 
families passing away, but I did not kill your daugh-
ters,· PrInce said. 

Beginnin(with the murder of Tiffany Schultz in her 
Clairemont apartment on Jan. 12, 1990. the 
·Clalremont Killer· terrorized women in the Clairemont 
area until the arrest of Prince a year later. Prince's 
victims were usually young women with brown hair 
between the ages of 18 and 21. The victims were killed 
by multiple stab wounds. 

Prince's second victim, 21·year-old Janene Marie 
Weinhold, was a student at UCSD. 

Prince was arrested In March, 1991, after samples 
of his blood were used to conduct genetic tests. The 
tests, which later linked Prince to semen found near 
the victims' bodies, were crucial to the prosecution's 
case against him. 

Medical School Announce. Plans 
10 Build Children'. Eye Center 

The UCSD School of Medicine has finalized design 
plans for the Abraham Ratner Children's Eye Center, a 
facility dedicated to pediatric eye care, The new facility 
will be located next to the Shiley Eye Center on Old 
Miramar Road and is Intended to expand the vision 
services provided through UCSD's Department of 
Ophthalmology. 

Ground-breaking is expected in March, 1994, with 

construction to be completed by the end of the year. 
Financed by private support, the facility will be 

named in honor of Abraham Ratner. whose widow is a 
major contributor to the project. 

"We are extremely grateful to the Ratner faillily for 
making it possible 10r us to create the Abraham Ratner 
Children 's Eye Cenrer. Children have always been an 
important part of the vision services we offer," said 
Department of Ophthalmology Chair Stuart Brown. 

"We now are able to expand on our pediatric 
services in an environment especially suited to chil-
dren,· added Brown, who also directs the Shiley Eye 
Center. 

The center will provide a full range of vision ser· 
vices, including routine eye examinations and treat· 
ment for common childhood eye disorders such as 
strabismus (crossed eyes) and amblyopia (lazy eye). 
Sophisticated diagnostic and treatment equipment 
will be available to physicians to treat children at the 
Ratner Center. 

"We will provide primary eye care to children and 
also serve as a resource to community pediatricians 
and opthalmologists when children have more compli· 
cated or rare eye disorders,' said pediatric 
opthalmologist David Granet. who will serve as medi· 
cal dirctor of the Ratner Children 'S Eye Center.

The reasons for the court 's re-

Irons added that it was also pos-
sible that this was the fi rst time Ihe 
court had seriously thought aboul 
its reslrictions on the use of the

The court's decision clears the

am rarely one to discuss re-
peti tive issues, but one 
theme that warrants contin-
ued attention is America's 
:nsatiable grab for "victim" 
status. Leave it to people-
panicularly college students 
and administrators-to sus-

tain this issue and upgrade its impor-
tance from a mere burp in the history 
of our cul tural evolution. 

These days it doesn't take much 
for a political, ethnic or religious group 
to cry "victim" and have all of society 
crying on its shoulders. It cenainly 
i n't like the old days when one group 
could legitimately claim to have been 
victimized if it - oh, say -lost six 
million of ilS people to genocide -
give or take a million. 

The problem is not the rampant 
scourge of victimizati on spreading 
through the nation - anyone who 
claims to have been victimized has 
orne justi fiab le reason for the an-

guish they experienced. The problem 
is how arbititrJrily victimization has 
evolved as many groups exploit it for 
their own politica l advantages. It 's as 
if we can ' t identify the victim any-
more than we can identify the vi lI ain . 

One ource of the blurred di stinc-
tion between victim and villain is the 
movement toward a politica lly COf-
rect America. In their pursuit to sensitize the boorish, 
testosterone· laden, barbaric Americans, the politically 
correct agents have mistakenly established a double 
standard. This standard, in the words of former colum-
nist Ben Boychuk, accepts "the burning of campus 
publ ications".[asj a celebration offree speech [while] 
calling someone a water buffalo has become a capital 
offense." 

The sexual conduct codes of Antioch college -
where each level of sexual activity from kissing to sex 
must have the approval of both panies - have been 
mentioned so often only because of the absurdity and 
backwardness of the codes and of those who proposed 
them. It is codes like these that cause mai nstream 
America to reject the pol itica l correctness as some 
intellectual malfunction of the liberal agenda. The 
politically correct movement keeps tryi ng to protect 
those who are victimized by an oppressive system 
insensitive to their special needs. Yet instead of estab-
lishing itself as a contendi ng political interest, the 
movement has merely wallowed in its hypocritical 
reasoning. as Americans are only reminded of the 
movement' s stupidity through occasional Newsweek 
coverage of it~ latest accomplisments. 

Past decades, uch a the greedy '80 , have been 
stereotyped: now the '905 are marked as the decade of 
whining victims. As "social awareness" hus crept in, 
citizens of the United Stutes are required to become 
more ~ensitive to tho e who were downtrodden or 
neglected during those horrible Reagan years. 

Yet victimization did not really establish it fOOLI ng 
until it started hilli ng its original antagonist - the 
Anglo-Saxon white male. Joel Schumacher's film Fa/{· 

By BEN LAVINE, Opinion Editor 

ing Down introduced America to "white-male para-
noia" presented in its Hollywood extreme. The social 
commentary presented by the film not only symbol-
ized much of the urban decay in Los Angeles, it 
illuminated a number of fears of the urban, white 
middle class. All of the frustration expressed by the 
lead character OFENS, played by Michael Douglas, 
was culminated in one line: ") did everything [society] 
told me, and I'm the bad guy?" 

Yes, the white male achieved his own unique form 
of victimization as he backlashed against an increasing 

'The problem Is how arbitrarily

number of liberal elements vilifying the European 
white male as the perpetrator of all social ills from 
urban poverty toColumbus' laughter of Native Ameri-
cans. But like DFENS, most white males see them· 
selves trying to survive in a tattered nation torn by a 
decline in moral va lues and cu ltuml worth.

LOPEZ MISSES POINT WITH BLACK RESPONSE TO DENNY BEATmG 
Editor: 

In hi s article on the Reginald 
Denny beating, Mario Lopez poses 
a question that I will answer here. 
You ask whether it is acceptable to 
beat or ki II someone because of his! 
her color. 

Because your question is a sur-
face question which evades the im-
portunt issues which torched the des-
perate streets of South Central Los 
Angeles and were slammed across 
the face of Reginald Denny, [ will 
hold my response until I clarify the 
issues which really played them-
se lves out in the Los Angeles rebel-
lion of 1992. 

Ironic as it may be, you yourself 
wrote the key to solving the Ameri-
can mystery of contemporary race 
relations which was viciously ig-
nited years prior to the Rodney King 
decision and simply exploded for 
public recognition in the spring of 
1992. 

You wrote "Actions have conse-
quences. People must be held re-
sponsible for their actions and the 
results of those actions. To ignore 
thi s simple principle is an invitation 
to anarchy." In doing so, you over-
looked your own main argument 
and its relation to American hi story. 

Anarchy set foot on thi s land 
with the first chained dark body that 
survived by slave codes, rather than 
li ved by American laws. Anarchy in 
the American dream is engraved in 
the scarred flesh, the leathered skin 
and the raped blood of America's 
shadowed brother. Anarchy of jus-

tice and equality for all will not be 
embraced by American society un-
til dominant American society -
white Americans- looks back into 
itshistory on this land. 

Guilt-free statements, such as 
"" m not my great-grandfather" hold 
no water in the struggle for Ameri -
can equality, simply because all ac-
tions have consequences. Black men 
and women live under the suffocat-
ing load of centuries of illiteracy, 
centuries of broken fami lies and sto-
len loved ones and centuries of so-
cial inferiority. 

Wh ite men and women li ve un-
. der the shelter of a 250-year head 

start in education (and you wonder 
why blacks score lower than whites 
on standardized tests, and an equal I y-
long head start in business manage-
ment. Whoever manages the money 
manages the government, whether 
we like it or not. 

This is why the contemporary 
struggle is actually be tween the 
haves and the have nots. It just so 
happens that blacks tend to fall into 
the ha ve-not category. 

Howcan we expect a historically 
targeted group of people to over-
come 250 years of institutionalized 
enslavement in the one generat ion 
between the Civil Rights movement 
and the ReaganlBush era, which 
expected the black community to 
have completely recovered?

America has always feared the

because the black man has always

America has noth ing to fear but

6 OPINION The UCSD Guardian Monday. NOVI' llIhl' I' 8. 1993 

READERS RESPOND TO .LOPEZ AND VASQUEZ LEITER 
Editor: 

Normally, I do not choose to 
respond toany articles writlen in the 
Guardian, but Mario Lopez's ar-
ticle on the Reginald Denny beating 
warrants a response. You made too 
many statements out of ignorance 
and lack of understanding. Allow 
me to take a moment from my stud-
ies to educate 'IOU. 

Before I do so, I must say that 
you made many statements that I 
resented as an African American. 
However. I will only respond to a 
few of them. First of all, I resent the 
~tatement that you made in refer-
ence to Jesse Jackson, Maxine Wa-
ters and other African-American 
leaders inciting violence with chants 
of "no justice, no peace." Obvi-
ously, you have no understanding of 
this phrase. It is clear from your 
article that you interpret this phrase 
a "no ju tice, there will be vio-
lence." What superficial thinking! 

No peace has many definitions, 
but the use of violence is probably 
last on the li st. No peace means 
African Americans will fill the court 
houses demanding equal protection 
under the law. No peace means Af-
rican Americanswill actively speak 
out against acts of racism. No peace 
means challenging laws. No peace 
means challengi ng the present au-
thorities - police departments, 
mayors, congressmen, senators and 
even the president, if necessary. 
None of this involves violence. 

However, it does involve mobi-
lization of the African-American 
community with a common agenda 
and purpose. It involves intellectual 

combat and not physical combat, 
except incases of self-defense. Was 
the response of African Americans 
to the King verdict only out of anger 
and frustration, as you state? No. 
Once again, Mr. Lopez, that state-
ment is evidence of your superficial 
thinking. African Americans were 
not just angry about the verdict. 

They were angry and frustrated 
about years and years of authorities 
mistreating, misrepresenting and 
misleading them. The rebellion in 
Los Angeles was a means of re-
sponding to the authority's mistreat-
ment that exists within the African-
Americans' communities. It was 
about reclaiming what was at one 
time understood. It was about ex-
pressing the frustration of the lack 
of protection of constitutional rights 
within urban communities. 

Let's talk about the true "two 
faces" of the justice system. One 
face is that when African Ameri-
cans are beating a white man, a 
videotape is crucial evidence. It is 
the key witness. The other is that 
when white men beat African-
American men in front of witnesses 
and a videotape is made, the video-
tape has no significance in deter-
mining the guilt of the offenders. 
The first face says that a videotape 
of whites beating African Ameri-
cans shows an act of self-defense, 
even if the victim is defenseless. 

You see, this is not only about 
justice being served in terms of the 
punishments and penalties. It is 
about justice being served in terms 
of the way in which a case is devel-
oped. The evidence that convicts an 

FMIik 
African-American male cannot con-
vict a white male, even if the evi-
dence comes in the same form. Thi s 
is not to justify the beating ofDenny. 
Neither the beating of Denny nor 
Rodney King should have occurred. 
However, I believe you have re-
sponded to the wrong faces of the 
justice system. You, too, have been 
victimized and manipulated by the 
media. 

Do you sti II stand by the state-
ment that the beating of King is 
irrelevant to the Denny case? I sure 
hope not. In fact, the beating of Ki ng 
is quite relevant. The beating of 
King coupled with the beating of 
Denny showed society that racism 
still exists. It did not end with the 
Emancipation Proclamation . It 
shows that there are inconsistencies 
within the justice system. It also 
shows that no matter who you are, if 
you have been harmed by another 
individual you deserve equal pro-
tection under the law. You see, Mr. 
Lopez, it is deeper than who is jus-
tified and who is unjustified. It is 
about a perpetuation of the same 

mentality that has caused racial con-
tlict for hundreds of years.

Vasquez Wrong on 
lIIepl Immigrants 
Editor: 

Dolores Ramirez Vasquez's let-
ter attacki ng political figures who 
oppose illegal immigration and the 
benefits these immigrants recei ve in 
the Uni ted States is uncalled for. 
Apparently she thinks more of the 
Mexican citizens than of the Ameri -
cans are being shortchanged because 
of a lack of funds - many of wh ich 
are now bei ng spent on undocu· 
mented iIIegals. 

Some of the Mexican-American 
groups feel that those who oppose 
illegal entry and benefits in the U.S. 
are racist. That might be true in a 
few cases but most orthe opposition 
comes from hard-working ci ti zens 
and even legal immigrant~ who 
played by the rules. 

As one who has been a supporter 
of civil rights, as a member of the 
Congress of Racial Equ a lity 
(CO.R.E.), a supporter of and par-
ticipant in the famous March on 
Washington in August, 1963, when 
Martin Luther King spoke and as a 
current contributor to the Southern 
Poverty Law Center which has 
fought and won large cases against 
racists and Kluxer groups, I resent 
her and other "Mexican First" 
groups. 

I sympathize with the plight of 

the poor in Mexico and those with 
Mexican backgrou nds here . I urge 
these Mexican-American groups do 
what other illlilligrant groups did -
urge those they are trying to help to 
lear'n English so they can better 
themseh'es el'onomil'<lll~ :l nd plan 
their families' growth on what they 
can afford. If each American family 
had not planned ahead in thi s area 
then many more of us would be in 
poverty - r know r would. 

r support fully the concept of not 
givi ng citizenship to n child born to 
an illegal immigrant. At present, 
once a child is declared an Ameri-
can citizen then the entire family 
can come into the U.S. even if they 
entered illegally. They al,o would 
be eligible for \~e lfare for a full 
generation. 

Having said all Ihi s I SUppOll 
legislation that would pro\'ide hea lth 
care for all Americans and legal 
immigrants and the II'mk, I'f~l ura in 
Wright Edelman and the spi rit of the 
recently deceased Supreme Coun 
Justice, Thurgood Mar,hal/' 

All of these have contributed a 
great deal in providing a human 
approach to some of our many prob-
lems.

In addition to the high number 
of UCSD graduates pursuing ad-

of bachelor-degree recipients are 
employed .full or part time.

Seventy-four percent of the 
class of 1987 is now employed 
full time. Ten percentofthegradu-
ates are employed part time, while 
12 percent are neither seeking em-
ployment nor pursuing adva'need 
degrees. 

Four percent of the 1987 gradu-
ating class is currently unem-
ployed. 

The rates of unemployment for 

the classes of 1989 (four percent) 
and of 1991 (seven percent) are 
similar, although th~ percentages 
of those graduates with full-time 
employment fall to 62 percent 
and 50 percent, respectively. 

The most popular career 
choices among all respondents are 
in the fields of business, com-
puter programming, engineering 
and scientific research. The data 

for median salaries of graduates 
shows that as they gain experi-
ence in the workforce, their sa la-

Furthermore, 74 percent of 
the graduates surveyed are 
working in the career field of

AIRWAVES: KSDT, the campus' student-run station, provides an 
alternative fonnat for listeners tired of the commercial grind 
By Erin Anderson 
Staff Writer 

isteners will never confuse KSDT, 
UCSD's student-run on-campus ra-
dio station, with more mainstream 
stations like KGB 01'91 X. As far as 
radio stations go, KSDT doesn't fit 
the mold of the run-of-the-mill ra-
dio programming listeners find on 
other stations across the dial. And 

according to the staff at KSDT, that's ex-
actly the way they want it. 

"I think a lot of times the people on 
campus don't really get a clear idea of 
what we're doing," said KSDT General 
Manager Craig Elsten, ''They're like 'Oh, 
you guys just play whacked-up, awful 
music.' 

"Butl think my philosophy behind it is 
that everyo}1e comes in here and plays a 
good show, and that you can hear, at this 
station, a variety of music that you just 
cannot even hear anywhere else," 

Mall Semancik, the music director at 
KSDT, agreed that the station provides a 
unique alternative for UCSD listeners. 
"There are no other stations in San Diego 
I;ke KSDT. And there are no boundaries 
for creativity," Semancik said. 
A Dlv.,.. Sutlon 

Since its inception over 20 years ago, 
KSDT has served as an alternative choice 
for music listeners in the San Diego area 
through an emphasis on a diverse reper-
toire of music. "The commercial stations 
playa limited amount of music simply 
because they believe you have to play 
music the listener knows, you have to 
make them feel comfortable," Semancik 
said. 

Because KSDT is neither overseen by 
the university nor supported byadvertizing, 
the station has more leeway than commer-
cial radio, according to KSDT's manag-
ers, They pointed out that administrators 
enforce profanity restrictions, and com-
mercialization often leads to overplay and 
repetition of music in popular demand. 

KSDT's music department is able to 
decide what music is played based on cre-
ative content, not based on the label on 
which it is released. 

"One band may not have as much pub-
licity, But if they're doing something dif-
ferent and display more creative expres-
sion than another band, KSDT is going to 
put them on," Semancik said. 

The majority of the music played on the 
station comes from smaller, underground 
labels which lends a uniqueness to the 
repertoire. Fifty percent ofthe music KSDT 
receives is not distributed to any other 
station in San Diego. Semancik attributes 
this to the more open-minded nature of 
college radio, which leads to more diverse 
programming, 

Programming Director Alex Ward said 
that this open policy allows KSDT to ex-
periment with a greater variety of musical 
styles on its airways and give bands which 
are just starting out a chance for radio 
ex posure. "There's an i ncredi ble diversity 
of music that cannot be categorized under 
rap. or grunge, or rock. KSDT keeps' itself 
open to more than these regular commer-
cial categories," he said. 

"So many bands out there today have not 
been discovered and don ' t have enough 
money to put out CDs, and these people do 
not receive any attention on commercial 
radio, basically, because commercial radio 
is used to make money," Ward said. ''That 
leaves a lot of bands out in the cold, and 
college radio can help these bands out," 

The station finds out about new bands 
through publications and press releases in 
the music industry as well as through per-
sonal contacts with bands and record com-
panies. Independent labels send samples 
of their music to the station which, by 
Ward's estimation, receives music from 
about 20 local and national bands daily . 
Occasionally, when a label is unable to 
distribute its own music, KSDT buys the 
music with its own funds. 

KSOThasearnedareputation with these 
independent labels and musicians as re-
ceptive to new and alternative talent. Ac-
cording to Ward, the relationship KSDT 
has developed with San Diego bands ben-
efits both panies. 

"KSDT's rela-
tionship with San 
Diego's local bands is close and friendly, 
not only business- like. They give us the 
music which helps create the music scene, 
and we help them out by giving them 
exposure," Ward said. 

Local bands and campus bands are 
showcased on a weekly show called ''The 
Noise Box" that airs from 8 to 10 p.m. 
on Wednesdays, The bands are inter-
viewed and play li ve in the KSDT 
studio. In addition, the station fea-
tures new local talent on other pro-
grams. 

Semancik said that although the 
programming philosophies of college 
and commercial radio differ, both have a 
place in San Diego. "[Commercial radio 
provides] you with choice A, and KSDT 
provides you with choice B," he said. 

''The bottom line in a fair, democratic 
system is that there should be alterna-
tives;' Semancik added, "We let the music 
speak for itself." Unlike commercial radio 
stations, KSDT programming does not fea-
ture OJs who spend more time talking than 

Dominic lobbla/Guardian 

playing records. "At KSDT, the music is 
primary, and the job of the DJ is to provide 
new, intriguing, and enticing music," 
Semancik added. 
Gettlnc Involved 

UCSD students can become KSDT DJs 
after they complete a five-step training

The diversi ty of the OJ style~ is e,sen-

according to Semancik. "A~ mll~ic direc-
tor, I don't really care whal the DJ' , musi-

"The one thing I do ask i, that they

At present , KSDT has a carri er current

space on the crowded FM dial is a 
problem. Finally, all of the DJs 
would need to be licensed as radio 
operators, and the station would 
have to adopt the strict guidelines 
of the Federal Communications 
Commission (FCC). 

According to Ward. the DJs 
would have little problem with 
FCC guidelines because of a regu-
lar station policy which prohibits 
the use of profanity. This policy 
advises caution in picking songs 
which include obscenities.

KSDT's' managers are looking at 
expanding the one-hour broad-

lems with the adaptation of an FM

Tritons 
Beat 
Panthers 
Again 
VOLLEYBALL: UCSD 
finishes regular season 
with 11 straight wins 
By BrIan K. Hutto 
Sports Editor 

The Triton women's volleyball 
team (21-9) concluded its regular 
season schedule with a 15-4. 15-6, 
6-15, 15-7 victory over Chapman 
University at the Triton Gym last 
Friday night. UCSD will host the 
first round of the NCAA Champion-
ship playoffs this Wednesday against 
Pomona-Pitzer. 

San Diego volleyball honored its 
seniors on Friday and the support-
ive crowd cheered the Tritons onto 
an easy triumph over the unher-
alded Panthers (4-20). 

The UCSD starters came out 
swinging in the first set, grabbing an 
early lead and never relenquishing 
it. The overmatched Panthers re-
corded only seven kills and com-
mitted six errors. Senior outside 
gunners Liz Vesanovic and Laura 
Kranz led the charge, and UCSO 
slaughtered the Panthers in game 
one, 15-4. 

Game two wasn' t much differ-
ent. The Tritons controlled the tempo 
on their way to a fast-and-furious 
15-6 cat washing. 

Dannevik pulled his starting unit 
for the third game and inserted his 
second team. Unfortunately, much 
like the Oct. 26 contest at Chapman, 
they ran into a bit of trouble. 

UCSO's errors doubled to six 
and its kill percentage plummeted 
to .190. Chapman took advantage of 
the youflgsters' mistakes and inex-
perience, elimin&ting all hopes of a 
clean sweep with a 15-6 battering. 

"Friday's main court big game 
put all the focus on them. I think that 
got to them," Dannevik said of his 
supporting squad. "It may have been 
premature to put them in at that 
position." 

~hapman, traditionally a Triton 
rag doll, has hardly provided the far

gym at 7 p.m. 

The Tritons have struggled al 
times this year. At one point in the 
season, they dropped four straight 
matches to UC Riverside, Point 
Lorna Nazarene College, Westmont 
College and Occidental College, re-
spectively. 

"Parts of our mid-season, we 
were not playing very well," 
Dannevik admitted. "But we have 
improved throughout the year and 
that's exactly what I expected." 

It was the Mizuno Tournament 
hosted by UCSD Oct. 15-16, that 
turned the tide for the Tritons. San 
Diego very nearly upset the nation 's 
top powerhouse, Wash U .• but even-
tually fell to the Bears in an emo-
tional five-set loss. 

However, they carried that mo-
mentum throughout the rest of the 
regular season, accumulating an 11 -
game winning streak to finish off 
the season. "We played with.heillht-

But the Panthers did gi '{e 
UCSO's second unit all it could 
handle - forcing five sets - in 
their loss to the Tritons in the Oct. 
26 matchup. The starters did nOl 

ened intensity in the last month. We 
are definitely ready for NCAAs," 
Dannevik said. 

"We established goals for differ-
ent parts of the year," Dannevik said 
about the Wash U. game. "We 
wanted to see how close or how far 
we were from being ready. We found 
out that we are as good or beller in 
most areas than we need to be . 

"I am not at all unhappy thol we

Dannevik rein~e n~d the ~taners

was no surprise - UCSD set and

Kranz led the Tri tons with 12 
kills and VeslInol'ic pounded 10.

''They li ke 10 be number one:' 

Dannevik mused on WlI.,hington· s

Sweet's Bid for NCAA Executive Director Turns Sour 
By Grea Wrenn 
Sfmlor Staff Writer 

UCSD Athletic Director Judith 
Sweet, one of three finalists for the 
job of NCAA executive director, 
will remain in San Diego for the 
time being, University of Arizona 
Athletic Director Cedric Dempsey 
was named the association's third 
Executive Director last week. 

Sweet had actually been a reluc-
• tant candidate for the job, turning 

down five requests 10 throw her hat 
in the ring. 

"Initially, they felt it was impor-
tant I be in the pool of candidates, 
The last time they contacted me it 

was a stronger message indicating 
they felt [ would be a good execu-
tive director," Sweet said last week 
while still in the middle of the inter-
view process. 

Sweet expressed mixed emotions 
on Saturday about the decision. "I'm 
disappointed not to be able to con-
tinue my involvement [at an execu-
tive level) with the NCAA, but I'm 
very happy to be staying with 
UCSD," she said . 

Sweet, who has been athletic di-
rector since 1975, has experience at 
the higher levels of NCAA activity. ' 
She served as vice president and 
secretary-treasurer before being 

elected to a two-year term as NCAA 
president in 1990. 

However, her bid for executive 
director may have been hampered 
by her present position at a Division 
IJI school that has no football pro-
gram. 

Sweet has also been at the center 
of a controversy within the associa-
tion. She served as a consultant to 
the NCAA Gender Equity Task 
Force, which has sought to enforce 
Title IX, the law stipulating equal 
opponunity for male and female ath-
letes. 

The genderequily issue has been 
a divisive one, especially among

It wa business as usual for the 
UCSD women's soccer team ( 17 -0-
I), which returned from Minnesota 
last ~ight as the NCAA Division III 
West Regional champions after 
amassing' 2-0 victories over both 
GUSi:!VUS Adolphus College and 
Wisconsin-Stevens Point over the 
weekend. 

The wins give 
the Tritons their 
secondstraight,and 
Ii fth in six years, 
berth in the Final 
Four. to be held 
next weekend at 
William Smith 
College inGeneva, 
NewYo!t. 

The Tritons 
faced host Gu ta-
vus Adolphus on 
Saturday. It was 
a teeth-chattering 25 degrees at kick-
off, and it remained chilly for UCSD 
throughout the first half. The Tri -
tons fired five shots before inter-
mission, but were unable to convert. 

Things warmed up a bit for the 
Tritons II minutes into the second 
half. Jennifer Ewert found team-
mate Carin Pugh running right and 
fed her the ball. Pugh took off down 
the right sideline, then cut inside 
and took it to the goal line, where 
she fired back across the center.

keep his players away from distrac-
tions such as the field orthe weather, 
the coach didn't hold practice on 
Thursday, opting instead to shoot 
hoops in the gym. 

Sunday's game pitted the Tri-
tons against Wisconsin-Stevens 
Point (16-4-1), who defeated Trin-
ity 4-2 in overtime Saturday. It was 
Stevens Point's first trip to the re-
gional playoffs and UCSD made 
sure that any plans for a Cinderella 
Final Four story were crushed. 

With the temperature a relatively 
balmy 38 degrees at kickoff, the 
Tritonsdidn't have to worry as much 
about checking body pans for frost-
bite every five minutes. The fields, 
on the other hand, had deteriorated dur-
ing the night by freezing over. There 
was no slippage in UCSD's play. 

out Stevens Point. The Tritons pep-
pered Walker with 18 shots, while 
limiting Wisconsin-Stevens Point to 
just three. 

McManus had been worried 
Stevens Point forwards Janie Pro bat 
and Jody Rosenthal, whom he had 
seen run roughshod over Trinity. 
"We denied them the ball com-
pletely," McManus said. Neither 
Rosenthal nor Probat had a shot. 

Much of the credit for the 
weekend's success, according to 
McManus, belongs to his defensive 
triumvirate of Sears, Dawn Lee and 
Diana Muchowski, who have been 
the keystone of the Tritons' 13 shut-
outs this season. ''The back three 
never put a bad foot down all week-
end," the coach said. 

In addition, McManus said, the 
Tritons' strategy of continual offen-
sive pressure in both games had 
offset some of the opposition's 
speed, which had been a source of 
concern for the coach last week.

With just under two minutes to

Amanda Johnson found herself in 
front of the goal. chasing a ball that 
Stevens Point goalkeeper Savonte 
Walker also had a bead on. Johnson 
beat Walker to the punch and put 
UCSD up 1-0. 

"I thought the first game was 
tougher, because we dominated 
more in the second game," UCSO's 
Eva Kingsbury said. "We went out 
hard in both games, but actually Cal 
Lutheran [a 1-0 Triton victory last 
Wednesday] was tougher than.both

UCSD waited until there was 
only I :21 left in the game to finish 
out the scoring. This time Amanda 
Johnson got the assist when she fed 
Pugh from the left side of the net. 
Pugh handled the pass and simply 
tapped it past the helpless keeper. 

While Gustavus Adolphus at 
least put up a fight, UCSD wiped 

"We played well for the condi-
tions," Amanda Johnson said. "But 
we knew that it was not going to be 
pretty soccer." 

At least, the Tritons are now pre-
pared for what is li,kely to be another 
hot -c hocol ate-and-a-roari ng-fire 
kind of Final Four. 

The Tritons' semifinal game on 
Saturday will be against Plymouth

M. SOCCER: 
Tritons advance to 
the Elite Eight 
Continued from page 20 
ota, failed to scratch the plus side 

of the Gusties' net. 
Gusties goalkeeper David Gm-

ham played like a man possessed. 
snuffing a total of 12 shots and frus-
trating UCSD ' s leading scorer Chri s 
Romey at almost every turn. 

With 14 minutes to play in the 
first half. a loose ball found its way 
to Romey at the top of the goalie 
box. and he sent a shot screaming 
toward the top left of the cage. A 
leaping Graham snared the ball in 
mid-flight. 

Gmham stifled two shuts from 
Erik Waldman. three from Romey 
and one from Brian Turner in the 
first half alone. 

Amazingly, Gmham' s nightmare 
only worsened in the second hal f. 

UCSD's Ken Fujii lofted across-
ing pass with 28:32 left in the half to 
a charging Romey. An airborne 
Romey redirected a picture-perfect 
header to the right-upper"Y" of the 
cage. The ~tunned home crowd of 
over 700 witnessed Grahams' leap-
ing. last-second tipofthe sure goal. 

"Their goalie was really on his 
game," Armstrong said in the un-

der~tatement of the year. 
"IHel saved their game," UCSD 

defender Matt Chilton agreed. "We 
definitely were the beller learn." 

The regulation ended in a score-
less tie, forcing two 15-minuteover-
time periods, in which Graharnagain 
sent Romey, Chong Yu and Todd 
Curran packing. 

Finally. the game came down to 
u series of five penalty kicks per 
team. Graham saved consecutive 
shots from UCSD's Ken Burns and 
Jay Newcomer, and Triton goalie 
Michael Madden continued his net-
minding mastery with leaping stops 
of the Gusties' Darren Carlson and 
Aaron Lee. 

UCSD' s Chilton finally pen-
etrated the Graham defensive wall, 
nailing a left-side shot to put the 
Tritons up by one. Gustavus' Peter 
Beck evened the score at one before 
Triton Brett Egusa launched a right 
comer shot for the 2-1 lead. 

Ithough Gnlham's outstanding 
performance kept the Gusties' hopes 
ali ve. it was Madden who stole the 
show. Leaning to the right of Nels 
Dokl,en's shot. he rapidly reversed 

his direction to stifle both the at-
tempt and the Gusties' hopes for an 
upset. 

Romey clinched the victory with 
a left-corner scorcher that not even 
Gmham could get his hands on. 

"I wasn' t too terribly nervous." 
Romey said of the opportunity to 
shoot the game winner. "I knew I 
could make these. I was just saying. 
'don' t letthisguy save them again. '" 

" This game was rubbish." 
Armstrong said. "We had a lot of 
nervous tension and our emotional 
clock went right over the top. We 
have to forget it and start again." 

Sunday's Colorado College con-
test again showcased an exceptional 
Triton defense. Colorado College 
qualified for the regional fi nals by 
beati ng Claremont College 4- 1 in 
Saturday's first game. 

Tritons Brian Turner, Nick 
Terlecky. Chilton and Maddencom-
pletely shut down highscoring Ti-
ger forwards Noah Epstein (57 
points on the season) and Arron 
Lujan (56 points). but San Diego's 
offense sti ll could not capitalize on 
its opportunities. 

Tiger defenders Isaac Jones, Jeff 
Montera, Serapio Baca and Tom 
Heisler blanketed Romey like a fog 
and used every opportunity they had 
to beat him down, litemlly. 

In a very physical game. the Ti-
gers committed 21 fouls compared 
to the Tritons' 19. Free kicks ran 
rampant, but both Madden and Colo-
rado goalie Mark Handy blanked all 
first-half shots that came their way. 

Senior speedster Robert Ripley 
provided instant entertainment early 
in the second half. Ripley burned 
past the Tigers' defenders at 48: 18, 
but cou ldn't quite control the ball 
enough to put it past Handy. who 
came charging out to snare the shot. 
Ri pley' s forward momentu m caused 
a collision in front of the goal. Handy 
held onto the ball. but remained on 
the ground for about five minutes. 

Madden returned the favor by 
snagging in mid-air a Baca header at 
the far right-hand comer of the goal 
and pulling off another di ving. off-
balance save of an Epstein headerto 
the right side of the cage. 

Neitherteam truly controlled the 
game - the Tigers launched seven 
shots to the Tritons' five. but 
UCSD's defen\e prevented Epstein 
and Lujan from getting a good look 
at the goal throughout. 

At 82:09. the Tritons finally capi-
talized. Sergio Salvador controlled

" I was surprised it got by the 
defense. but when it did I saw the

scribed. 

"We were overwhelmed by the 
physical and athletic nature of the 
game," Colorado College Head 
Coach Horst Richardson said. ''This 
is the first ti me all season we have 
been shut out. UCSD has a lot of 
great athletes." 

"We could have won it up to the 
75 th minute. but [Armstrong) can

GREGG 

lHHEnn 
Evander 
Chutes His 
Way to Title 

Well, let's see, anything of 
note happen this weekend in 
the sports world? Umm, 
nothing really stands oul. A 
special shout goes out to the 
UCSD soccer teams and their 
stunning playoff victorie , of 
course. But other than that, not 
too much ... oh, wait a minute, 
wasn't there.a boxing match or 
something? 

Yes, as a matter of fact, 
there was. Bowe-Holyfield 11-
Repeat or Revenge. Say what 
you want about pay-per-view, 
this was one fight that was well 
worth the five bucks I paid to 
see it. 

It was a stirring bout 
between two gladiators: one a 
well-trained, bOdy-of-steel 
warrior and the other a well-
one, bouncer-looking type of 

guy with a body like a glazed 
old-fashioned who just 
happens to be one of the 
toughest men alive. 

But what this fight was 
really all about was the 
parachute guy. In the middle of 
the seventh round, one James 
Miller, address unknown, 
dropped out of the sky and 
onto the ring apron. His 
parachute caught in the lights 
over the ring, and Mr. Miller 
got tangled in the ropes before 
flopping over backwards into 
the crowd. 

What an idiot. I mean, this 
guy had to overcome a lot of 
obstacles to get to his destina-
tion. First of all, there was a 
canopy over the ring, 0 he 
wore a propeller on his back to 
come in horizontally under the 
tarp. But what was he think-
ing? A parachute is a big thing. 
How did he expect to fit his 
chute under the lights? If 
you're going to go to all the 
trouble of planning a stunt like 
this, you might as well get it 
right. 

Of course, once he hit the 
ropes, the real trouble began. 
As he tried to struggle away, he 
dropped into the second row of 
fans. That's when half the 
crowd decided to step in and 
kick the crap out of him. Some 
security guy started swinging 
away with hi walkie-talkie 
while Bowe's manager, Rock 
"Si lly Hat" Newman, got a 
couple of licks in. 

Sure, the fans beat up the

MEN'S SOCCER: Wins over Gustavus Adolphus 
and Colorado College send UCSD to quarterfinals 
By Brian K. Hutto 
Sports Editor 

Now, it matters. UCSD men's 
soccer Head Coach Derek 
Armstrong has stressed the impor-
tance of playing well 
in the regular season 
all year, and the Tri-
tons have dominated 
their opposition, 
amassing a 12-game 
unbeaten streak en 
route to an impres-
sive 16-2-1 overall 
record. Armstrong' S 
response: "The regu-
lar season means 
nothing now, it's a 
whole n~w game out there." So the 
multi-talented Triton squad shifted 
gears, barrelling into the postseason 
this past weekend. UCSD escuped a 
scare from Gustavus AdolphusCol-

lege on Saturday, outpointing the 
Gusties 3-1 in a do-or-die penalty 
kick decision and advancing to 
Sunday's North CentralIFar West 
1993 NCAA Regional Champion-

ship Final against 
the Tigers from 
Colorado College 
here at UCSD. The 
Tritons' 1-0 triumph 
clinched a Nov. 14 
home field 
quarterfi nal contest 
against· Roanoke 
College of Virginia. 

Saturday's 
Gusties' clash could 
have easily blown 

Armstrong's speed-demons into a 
crushing first-round exit. The Tri-
tons, despite launChing enough shots 
to throttle the entire state of Minne-

GUARDIAN ATHLETES-OF·THE WEEK 

Sophomore Amanda Johnson was a major 
factor in the UCSD women 's soccer team 's victory 
over Wisconsin-Stevens Point in yesterday's West-
ern Regional Final. 

UCSD men 's soccer goalkeeper Michael Mad· 
den was one of the heroes for the Tritons during 
this weekend 's regional playoffs. 

The senior recorded shutouts against Gustavus 
Adolphus and Colorado College , including 
Saturday's overtime, penalty-kick thriller versus 
the Gusties. Madden stopped three of the first 
four penalty kicks to ensure the Triton victory. 

Johnson coll·;!cted a goal and an assist to give 
the Tritons the 2-0 win that sent San Diego to the 
Rnal Four, 

"The team knows the feeling from last year 
[when the Tritons lost]," Johnson said. ·We don't 
want to do that again .• 

"It was a necessary performance," Madden 
said. "I do what I can do. It was nothing special. "
