Mike Chinoy, NBC foreign correspondent 

NBC correspondent tells of 
experiences on foreign beat 
BY MICHAEL SCHWARTZ 

taft Writer 
The foreign correspondent 

is typically portrayed in 
books and movies as a 
dashing, robust man. 
fearlessly covering the most 
perilous of stories with 
uncompromising style and 
calm. 

Yet Mike Chinoy. a foreign 
correspondent for NBC 
News, does not strike one as a 
dashing and robust. or even 
particularly stylish. But after 
listening to the stories he 
told a group of UCSD 
students yesterday, one 
would agree that he is quite 
courageous and covers some 
of the most interesting and 
life -threatening stories 
around. 

Chinoy, who has covered 
Asia for network news since 
1975, presented his experi-
ences in the Mandeville Suite 
in Tioga Hall. with the help of 
video tapes of his news 
reports, to an audience of 
faculty and students from the 
departments and programs 9f 
history, sociology, linguis-
tics, chinese studies, political 
science and communications. 

Chinoy was invited to hold 
this session by his friend and 
admirer Paul G. Pickowicz. 
Associate Professor of 
History and chairman of the 

Program on Chinese Studie 
here. The presentation, 
which was co-sponsored by 
the programs in chinese 
studies and communication , 
was geared toward illustra-
ting the process by which a 
story, such as Soviet seizure 
of an Afgan village, finally 
reaches the American 
viewer. 

According to Chinoy, all 
stories are first cleared at 
NBC headquarter in New 
York and then investigated. 
Chinoy pointed out that often 
very interesting and 

important tories are 
"squeezed out" by editor 
simply . becau e of the time 
constraints within which 
network news mu t operate. 

Chinoy emphasized that 
while he tries to "stay in 
regular contact with New 
York ," there are time 
limitations and often he is 
involved in "substantial 
travel often on short notice." 

One example which he 
gave took place during 
coverage of the war in 
Afganistan. Reporters were

U C regents discuss 
affirmative action 

The UC system is making 
very active efforts to reach 
out to prospective students 
from groups typically 
underrepresented at UC. 

That is emphasized in a 
report on UC's outreach 
activities that was discussed 
with Regents yesterday in 
San Francisco. 

The Educational Opportu-
nity Program (EOP) was 
started by the Regents in 
1964 from funds they 
allocated and was designed to 
increase the numbers of 
minority and low-income 

students in the University. 
However , t he report 
recounts, "their numbers 
began to level off by 
1973 ... and it became 
apparent that new efforts 
were needed to increase 
educational opportunities for 
minority and low-i ncome 
young people." 

NCTn service better 

In studying the problem, 
UC staff members found that 
black . Chicano-Latino, 
American Indian and Filipino 
students attained eligibility 
for UC admission at much 
lower rates than white and 
Asian students. With that 
information. UC shifted its 
focus from simply recruiting 
minority studen ts to working 
with them at much earlier 
ages to help them attain 
eligibility for admi ion and 
establi shed the Student 
Affirmative Action Program 
(SAA). 

Beginning Mondar' North 
County Transit wil restore 
more dependable bus service 
to UCSD. 

Bus service to North 
County has been trou bled 
since Nov. 5 when NCT 
drivers, mechanics and 
clerical workers went on 
strike. 

Riders who depend on NCT 
line 3<)1, running south to the 
Veterans Administration 
Hospital from Ocean ide, to 

get to campus, can expect 
consistent hourly service 
between 6:15 am and 9:15 pm 
beginning Monday. 

Progress towards resolu-
tion of the strike ha been 
slow, but mediators for both 
sides have scheduled new 
talks for next Tuesday, NCT 
spokesman Michael Gillespie 
said yesterday.

'SDSP 3 ' trial 
posponed again 
--------_.-------------------------------------Police not cooperating 

BY PETER MORTENSEN 
News Editor 

The trial that wa 
cheduled for Monday of 

three San Diego Students for 
Peace member arre ted this 
summer while prote ting 
regi tration for the draft ha 
been continued untillan. 19, 
one of the defendent aid 
ye terday. 

The three - Mitch 0 na, 
Ahuva Novak and Fred Peck 
-were arre ted Aug. 1 while 
driving around the ite of a 
downtown ant i-registrat ion 
rally. Police cited them on 
various vehicle code relating 
to illegal position of 
passengers and obstruction 
of the driver' view by a 
banner. 

Sosna said that the date in 
San Diego Municipal Court 
was postponed because of the 
San Diego Police Depart-
ment's inability to produce 
"discoveries" as required by 
the defen e. The di coverie 
relate to th activitie of the 
police before, during and 
after the anti-regi tration 
rally at the downtown U 
Po t Office - ite of draft 
registration of 19-and 20-year 
old males thi ummer. 

Sosna said that the 
defense, represented by Ted 
Burner of the National 
Lawyer's Guild has a ked for 
a trial by jury. The court ha 
made no acknow-Iedgement 
concerning trial arrange-
ments, he added. 

IfÂ· convicted, the "SDSP 
Three" face fine totalling 
several hundred dollars. 

When court convene for 
the case in mid-January, 
Sosna said thejudge will hear 
a motion to dismis the case. 
If thi motion i denied. the 
case will go to trial that 
afternoon. 

But So na does not think 
that the ca e will be 
aismissed. The defen e i 
asking for dismissal on the 
basis that charges against 
the three show "discrimina-
tory law enforce-ment in an 
attempt to suppress First 
Amendment rights," he said. 

"It is my opinion that they 
won't dismis the case. 
They'd be agreeing that the 
police department did ind~ 
discriminate in pro ecutmg 
u in uppres ing our First 
Amendment right ," Sosna 
said. 

o 'na believe that the 
court ha demon trated that 
it will defend the city ' police 
"no matter how incorrect 
their actions." 

And the fact that the police 
had "difficulty in complying 
with the motions of di covery 
as granted by the court" at a 
hearing in October for the 
group irritate Sosna. 

"They're taking their time 
on this and there is no excuse 
for it," he aid. The police did 
say ye terday, though, that 
they were "sending along" 
recordings of 19 hours of 
police radio tran missions 
urrounding the time of the 

arre t . 
Th police have notified 

the defen e thatthey recently 
forward d "a packet" 
containing an un pecified 
amount of information 
relating to the di coveries. 
So na said that hi lawyer 
had not received the 
material a of ye terday. 

Other defen e discovery 
motions include the names of 
all officer in olved in the 
arrest at the rally, 
statement . to police by all 
witnesses to the ca e, oral or 
written tatement by the 
defendent on file with the 
police. police note and 
memo relating to the events 
of the day and a detailed list 
of some material relating to 
the ca e that was destroyed 
before the di covery motions 
were granted. 

So na acknowledged that 
there may be a rally outsideof 
the courthou e prior to the 
trial inlanuary. Heal onoted 
that there will be increased 
draft registration resistance 
throughout the month as 
registration at local post 
office re urnes then. 



The pitfalls that confront Reagan in Central America 
BY FRANZ 

SCHURMANN. 
Nowhere in the world was 

there such a strong 
conviction that Ronald 
Reagan's victory would 
signal a big difference in US 
foreign policy ~ in Central 
America_ Reagan's stunning 
triumph was celebrated 
wildly by right-wing forces in 
El Salvador, while Havana 
gloomily marked it as a 
return to US intervention-
ism 

Throughout t he campai~, 
Reagan vowed a tough pohcy 
toward communism in the 
Americas. He called for a 
blockade of Cuba, and his 
advisers openly dispar~ 
Cuban and commuDlst 
inv()lvement in the EI 
Salvador conflict and in post-
Somoza Nicaragua. 

The whole record of the 
last two Republican adminis-
trations, those of Nixon and 
Ford, suge&ts that the US 
will veer sharply, from what 
had been a liberal and 
cautious policy toward Latin 
America under Carter tC' a 
tough, hard-line approach 
under R~an. Indeed, one of 
the earliest and most 
dramatic consequences of the 
election may be a direct US 
involvement in the bloody 
civil war now tearing EI 
Salvador apart. 

Since the US is already 
involved in backing the so-
called "centrist" junta in the 
form of weapons shipments, 
financial aid and the presence 
of advisor - shades of 
Vietnam when Kennedy 
assumed office in January , 
1961 - it is not diffucult to 
imagine how Reagan might 
easily allow this involvement 
to grow quickly. 
Franz Schurmann, professor 
of history and sociowgy at UC 
/Jerkeiey, wrote this for the 
Pacific News Seroice. 

But as in those early days 
of US-Vietnam involvement, 
when success seemed mainly 
a function of money and fire 
power, so now the strident 
demands of the Central 
American right for just a 
little more aid to secure final 
victory obscure the full 

The US will veer 
sharply from what 
had been a liberal 
and cautious policy 
toward Latin Am-
erica under Carter 
to a tough, hard-
line approach 
under Reagan. 
picture_ Upon examining 
what lies behind the 
obscurities, however, one can 
see massive pitfalls and 
quicksand that could easily 
plunge the Reagan Adminis-
tration into another Vietnam-
type situation well before it 
has a chance to try out its 
approaches to setting the US 
on the right course again. 

The bitter confl ict in El 
Salvador involves more than 
the hapless people of that 
country. Already drawn in 
directly and indirectly, are 
Guatemala and Honduras 
which support the right wing 
and Ni ca r ag ua whi c h 
supports the lef t. Also 
involved are Costa Rica , 
Panama and Venezuela, who, 
w hil e s uspicious of the 
radical leftism of the EI 
Salvador ins urgen ts , fear 
even more the poss ibility of a 
return to US interventionism 
which could easily evoke a 
tidal wave of anti-American-
ism in countr ies with fairly 
conservative and repressive

regimes, 
The powerful symbolism 

of "el imperialismo yanqui" 
throbs everywhere in Latin 
America, much as hatred of 
Russia does among the Poles. 

But these are elements in 
the political landscape which 
Reagan's advisors are fully 
aware of. They Rave been 
constants in the Latin 
American political scene for a 
long time_ 

However, two new 
swellings appear on the 
landscape which Reagan's 
advisors may be inclined to 
dismiss as easily asJohnson's 
advisors di s missed the 
staying power of the 
Vietcong. Those new factors 
involve Mexico and the 
Catholics. 

Many Americans, while 
knowing better, still tend to 
see Mexico as a sombrero 

republic. But it now has a 
population half that of the 
United States. It is 
undergoing a pell -mell 
industrialization all the 
while it suffers from grinding 
poverty. For the first time in 
Its history, it has wealth and 
influence that go beyond its 
borders. 

In the conflict with 
Somoza, Mexico strongly 
supported the left ist 
Sandinistas. Now it shows its 
support for the leftist 
insurgents in Guatemala and 
EI Salvador. The day after 
Reagan 's election, Presedent 
Jose Lopez Portillo warned 
the US not to intervene in the 
Central American conflicts. 
And the Nicaraguan ambas-
sador in Mexico City said 
that if the US intervened in 
EI Salvador . to support the 

~ 

right, Nicaragua would go in 
to support the left. 

The Mexicans are convinc-
ed, based on the experiences 
of their own revolution, that 
revolutionary ferment will 
continue in countries such as 
El Salvador and Guatemala 
until a leftist regime comes to 
power and is able to satis fy 
the key grievance of the 
peas antry - land re -
distribution_ Such a regime 
could then re-establish law 
and order, just as in Mexico 
after the 1910-1920 revolu-
tion , which promulgated a 
dramatic land reform. And 
just a s the Mex ican 
revolutionary party, the PRI , 
turned into an entrenched 
mandarinate in Mexico, so 
the Mexicans believe leftist 

. regimes will do elsewhere in 
Central America.

by police a few days later_ 

Since this act was a

Town Bloody Hall hasMailervs.fems 
BY TED BURKE 

There are perverse types who think 
that if one places a group of people in 
the same room who've sworn, 
metaphorically or literally, to destroy 
each other, the reflex to go for one's 
gun will subside and what will result 
is a rank exchange of opinion, insights 
and life stories. And after the 
participants have learned that they're 
not nearly as distant from each other 
as they had thought, they'll lock arms, 

Greer (author of The Female Eunich), 
radical lesbian Jill John on, literary 
critic Diana Trilling and a 
representative from The National 
Organization of Women, whose name 
I am unable to recall. At that time, 
Kate Millet had viciously vilified 
Henry Miller, D.H . Lawrence and 
Mailer himself in her tract Sexual 
Politics as outstanding representa' 
tives of an elitist male literary culture 
that has oppressed women by 

A lot of us like to watch a good cat fight, 
like kzds fighting over the use of a toy 
brothers and sisters all, and stroll 
down the beach into the risingsun of a 
higher revolution. 

Anyone of us can, of course, say 
'posh' to such self-destructive 
Jeffers0l1isms and know, ' smirking. 
that enemies remain antagonists to 
the bone despite the demands of 
decorum. Usually the result of such 
debate situations are inconclusive and 
static, with neither side abjuring to 
the points made by an opponent. A lot 
of us like to watch a good cat fight, 
si tuations where otherwise 
reasonable people are reduced to the 
level of kids fighting over the use of a 
prized toy. As in hack-and-slash 
horror films, many of us get a cheap 
thrill over blood being drawn for no 
good purpose. 

So was the case with the film Town 
Bloody Hall, a documentary in the 
cinema vertie mode by D.A. 
Pennebaker. which was shown last 
week to initiate a new weekly film 
serie at the La Jolla Museum of 
Contemporary Art. Filmed in 1971, it 
is an account of a debate between 
writer Norman Mailer and an 
as ortment of prominent femini t 
polemici t , who included Germaine 

distortin~ their image so that the 
imaginatIOns of male fictionalists 
might be better served. 

Mailer. whose pugnacious 
reputation has at times dwarfed his 
writings in the pu blic mind, countered 
with The Prisoner 0/ Sex, a scathing 
attack on Millet's_ lack of literary 
critical skills and her deliberate 

misreadin~ of the texts she was 
dealing WIth. It is also at turns a 
brilliant defense of Millet and 
Lawrence and a convoluted agonizing 
over the "existential" aesthetic in 
male/female relationships. In any 
case, Mailer's book sparked a fair 
amount of pu blic debate, and some 
enterprising souls thought it would be 
a neat idea to have The Prisoner 
confront representatives from the 
opposition. To be expected, the event 
was hardly a shining example from a 
Kansas debate manual, but was 
rather a riot of rhetoric, nameÂ·calling, 
heckles from an unruly crowd and 
public spectacle. In other words, an 
intellectually worthless few hours, 
but, I'd say, a rousing good time. much 
like a TV. wrestling match on a 

aturday afternoon. 
With Mailer officiating, each 

speaker was to be given ten minute to 
speak, after which Mailer would pose 
a question. Things got off to a proper 
start. First to talk was the NOW 
representative, who offered a list of 
moderate feminist proposals: 
housewives should draw a living 
wage, women should get equal pay for 
equal work and other less than 
incendry ideas. Greer spoke next, 
eloquently attacking the premise of 
Mailer's literary heroisms and 
poetically called for an art of the 
collective. not of one voice but many. 

Then matters derailed and ('.arne the 
point where the night got 
permanently off-track. Reading from a 
text composed in the stream on 
conscious manner that has always 
sent me to pounding my head against 
the wall, J illJohnson rhapsodized that 
all women are able to love all other 
women and until men are able to love 
all other men, the hopes of an all-
embracing social revolution will be 
scuttled like pipe dreams. Mailer, 
poking a pencil through a cardboard 

woman-friend on tage while Mailer 
demands that she "act like a lady." 
When the audience cheers the pair on, 
Mailer say "You people paid twenty-
five dollars to see two pairs of dirty 
jeans wrestle on stage, which seems 
odd to me because you can ee all the 
cock and cunt you want down the 
street for four bucks." Johnson and 
friend leave the hall, not to return. 

Picking up the pieces after 
Johnson's psycho-theatrics was hard, 
and for the rest of the debate the panel 
split hairs on Mailer's "poeticized" 
understanding of biology, whether 
vaginal orgasms were possible, 
Mailer's warnings that Women's Lib 
has the potential of becoming a left-
wing totalitarianism, why the 
women 's movement must concern 
themselves with their own lot over all 
other causes and a host of other 
feelings, all accompanied by the 
interjections of an audience. With 
that, the night was ended, with no 
one's mind changed and few friends 
gained . 

a rousing good time, much like a TV 
wrestling match on Saturday afternoon 
coffee cup, his face a mass o( 
downturned lines, cut Johnson off at 
this point, saying that she'd done five 
minutes over the time limit. Johnson 
stands motionless while the audience 
heckles Mailer, demanding that he let 
her conclude. After an exchange of 
curses, he initiates an audience vote 
and concludes that the 'nays' have it. 

â¢ Someone in the audience heckles 
Mailer again. and Mailer, agitated.

the long run everyone loses their 
congency as tangent pin out faster 
than a car on a greased blacktop- but 
just how the women's movement will

Foot' race

those who are older to run 
against a 21-year old 'macho' 
waiter. So, we have added the 
'Fastest' category, where 
running will be allowed and 
the 'Most Skillful ' division 
for walkers only." Doering 
added that waiters and 
waitresses must arrive at 
noon to pre-register for the 
" Fastest' Division and 2:30 
pm for the " Most Skillful" 
Category. The race will be 
h eavi ly monitored by 
personnel to avoid infrac-
tions of previous years. 

"The prize are valuable 
enough to encourage orne 
competitors tostray from the 
rules," Doering notes. "[n 
previous years, we've seen 
them pour champagne pilled 
onto the tray back into the 
glass, or, to hold onto the rim 
of the glass with thum bs. 
Those kinds of things , 
including pu hing, shoving, 
elbowing et cetera are 
frowned upon. In fact, if we 
see it , the guilty party is 
immediately disqual ified .. " 

Although the San Diego 
Police Department aids race 
officials with traffic 
problem ,they do not oversee 
race infractions . 

Because officials are still 
attempting to arrange full 
prizes, in addition t<;> 
trophie , for both divi ions, a 
listing of awards will be 
released hortly. The first 70 
participants will receive free

program provides funds for 
recruitment of eligible high

college students, for financial

areas, the SAA Program has 
supplemented existing EOP 
resources. " 

The first major component 
of the Student Affirmative 
Action Program was the 
Partnership Program, begun 
in 1976, whereby faculty, 
students and staff from the 

UC work with students in 
grades '7 through 9 motiva-
ting them to aspire to higher 
education and providing 
academic assistance to help 
realize those aspirations. The 
schools targeted for the 
Partnership Program are 
ones t hat have a high 
proportion of minority 
students who are underre-
presented at UC. There is a 
Partnership Program at each 
of the eight general UC 
campuses that works with 
the junior high schools in its 
geographic region. More than 
250 junior high'schools are 
now working with the UC in 
the Partnership Program. 

In addition to the EOP and 
SAA Program ' which are 
operated on all nine UC 
campuses, the report also 
describes additional efforts

In the ten years since the

shore up its own resources 
and have shown themselves 
to be astonishingly effective.

means that the women's 
movement is faced with 
crisis, a crisis that means 
that the advancements 
women have managed over 
the years could be handily 
wiped out, setting them back 
to SQuare one. 

Town Bloody Hall quite 
unintentionally reveals what 
the women's movement must 
do: the coffeehouse bohemia-
nism must be doffed and 
women must more than ever 
enter the tooth-and -nail 
ruthlessness of mainstream 
electoral politics. And that 
will be the next test on the 
movement. If it's to have a 
lasting effect on the culture 
in which all of us live, it must 
be affirmed at the voting 
booth. A sudden realism is 
upon all of us.

forbidden to enter combat 
zones. If by chance they were 
able to penetrate the zones, 
they were primaril y 
concerned with their own 
well-being. 

As such, "very few 
journalists actually witness 
combat." So when he was 
asked by an Afgan rebel if he 
had seen the man's movie, he 
was quite interested. The 
man's movie turned out to be 
a first-hand look at the 
battles in the mountains of 
Afganistan , so Chinoy 
offered the man money for 
the film, and was eventually 
able to buy the film for $1500. 

The film was then 
videotaped in London and the 
tape was transmitted by 
satellite to New York and 
aired on NBC News.
