Senior Staff Writer 

The 21st annual Sun od 
festival began at 10 a.m. with 
activity, food and information 
booths scattered throughout 
campus. It concluded with a con-
cert ar RIMAC Field thar drew 
nearly 15,000 students. 

"This year was pretty excel-
lent," A.S. Festival Co-coordina-
tor Alex Kushner said. "Relative 
to other years, it attracted about 
3,000 on average." 

Concert doors opened at 5 
p.m. when Beston and the 
Kitchen warmed up a smaU crowd 
from the newly introduced side 
stage. Srudents started flowing in 
steadily at 7 p.m. when Latin beat 
group Kinky took the stage. 
Natives of TIjuana, Mex., Kinky 
has been touring through Europe

Even the bands had a good 
time at un God, as White Starr

dig it, and they want to come out

Undergrads showcase research 
Conference recognizes student achievement 

UCSA members ejected 
from Regents meeting 

ByJUNMA 
Senior Staff Writer 

A host of sfildents, faculty and 
administrators gathered at the 
UCSD Faculty Club on May 17 
for the 16th annual 
Undergraduate Research 
Conference. The event was the 
first of three symposiums made 
possible by Academic 
Enrichment Program and the 
Office of Student Affairs. 

The other two are the 
Faculty/Mentor Research 
Conference later this month and 
the Summer Research 

onfcrence in August. 
Conference organizers invited 

89 undergraduate students to 
conduct presentations and papers 
on their research topics for fellow 
students and moderating profes-
sors in a collection of I J round-
table discussions. 

Each student was nominated 
by a member of the UCSD facul -
ty as showing excellence in the 
fields they study. Professors of all 
majors were invited to submit 
recommendations. Majors on 
hand ranged from biological sci-
ences to anthropology and topics 
ranged from Advances in 
Bioengineering to Explorations 
in World History. 

"The purpose of UCSD's 
annual research conference is to 
recognize the outstanding schol-
arly work produced by our 
undergraduates," said conference 
coordinator Darlene almon. 
"We hope to stimulate additional 
Interaction between students and 
facul ty at the research level and 
encourage undergraduates to 
pursue degrees and careers in 

research and college academia." 
Organizers also hope that the 

conference provided a dynamic 
and vital link for students pursu-
ing a career in research and gave 
some experience in terms of pre-
senting facts obtained in 
research to the academic com-
munity. 

"Every student should come 
away from this with a feeling of 
confidence," said Loren C. 
Thompson, assistant vice chan-
cellor of student educational 
advancement. "Having faculty 
and fellow peers involved in dis-
cllssions of their topics is a ges-
ture of support from the univer-
sity for undergraduate research 
as a whole." 

The day began with guest 
speakers, including Chancellor 
Robert C. Dynes, followed by a 
series of presentations and dis-
cllssions that lasted for the 
remainder of the day. 

Many of the student presen-
ters felt a combination of excite-
ment and nerves. For most of 
them, it was their first time pre-
senting their research to profes-
sors. 

"I t's good to see the teachers 
pre ent during our speeches,· 
said Jackson Wong, an Eleanor 
Ro sevelt College student. 
"Everyone here has the same 
goal to learn and that puts every-
one on the same level. The facul-
ty members are here to learn 
about these topics just as we are, 
and in that respect, we can con-
sider them our peer . Knowing 
that relieves some of the pres ure 
when we're pre cnting OUf topics 
to them." 

Other students feel that the 

conference helped expose them 
to a broader range of topics relat-
ed to their field . 

"Instead of focusing solely on 
the one thing we're researching, 
we are also exposed to and can 
learn about other specialized 
areas that we may not have been 
aware of before," said Michael 
Tolleth, a Revelle College senior 
majoring in chemical physics. 

Many of the undergraduates 
attending the conference feel 
that the experience of presenting 
their findings to experts in their 
fields was the most rewarding 
part. 

"This conference has helped 
me reevaluate my research and 
explain it in simpler terms for 
people who are not familiar with 
my topic," said Olga Gaidarenko, 
a Thurgood Marshall College 
sophomore majoring in molecu-

Administrators on hand 
expressed their beliefs that the 
strength of a research university 
is to allow undergraduate stu-
dents to get their first experience 
in research and to learn what the 
creative process entails. They 
hoped that this conference 
helped expo e students to that 
process.

here experiences that flame of 
creative excitement that I experi-
enced as a student researcher and 
still experience as a profes ional,"

that it will carry them and drive 
them in the future to be focused

Members of the public, including 
students affiliated with the 
University of California Student 
Association, were asked to leave the 
May 14 UC Board of Regents meet-
ing held in San Francisco following 
the public comment period after 
audience members began to raJly and 
speak out of turn after the allotted 
time for the period expired. 

Representatives from UCSA, 
including UCSA Chair and UCSD 
student Stephen Klass, came to the 
public comment period to address 
possible student fee increases as well 
as the need for the creation of a stu-
dent advisory board to address a fee 
increase. 

KJass said many students hoped 
to address their concerns regarding 
the fee increase in front of the 
Regents, and those students became 
upset when the opportunity to speak 
expired. 

"Because it was such a con-
tentious issue, people were getting 
very heated ," KJass said. "They 
wanted to get their voices heard and 
this is the only capacity at the meet-
ing where people are allowed to 
make comments." 

The public comment period, 
which was originally allocated 20 
minutes in the agenda, was extended 
an additional 10 minutes by Regents 
Chair John Moores. Despite the 
extension, three speakers still were 
unable to deliver their comments and 
began to chant. 

The Regents meeting was tem-
porarily recessed and police ordered 
all members of the public to leave the 
gallery. Students reassembled and 
rallied outside and were met with by 
Regents Gayle Binion, Odessa 

Johnson, Velma Montoya, AJredo 
Terrazas and Tom Sayles as well as 
Student Regent Dexter 
Ligot-Gordon and Student Regent-
Designate Matthew Murray to hear 
the rest of their remarks. 

UC Spokesman Trey Davis said 
that even though not all students 
were able to relay their comments at 
the meeting, the Regents are aware 
of student issues. 

"Ir's not as if the only time the 
students get input is in that 20-
minute public comment period at the 
start of the meetings," Davis said. 
"Ir's an ongoing dialogue that occurs 
throughout the year." 

According to Davis, students and 
members of the public are allowed to 
contact Regents through any other 
number of means. Additionally, 
speakers are invited to submit the 
written entirety of their remarks. 

Guidelines for the public com-
ment period generally allow for three 
minutes to be provided to each 
speaker and for three individuals or 
more to combine their time fo r seven 
minutes of input. 

Davis defended the decision to 
end the public comment period after 
the first extension. 

"It's JUSt not fair to everybody else 
to suddenly hijack a meeting that has 
10 or IS items for one single item," 
Davis said. 

Klass said of the meeting overall 
that he felt the Regents "understood 
where UCSA was coming from" and 
that despite being asked to leave the 
meeting, UCSA was able to get their 
message across. 

"Some believe (the public com-
ment periodlls the only way that stu-
dents can get their voices heard, but 
in a lot of ways being kicked out was 
a success an helping the cause," KJas 
said.

The United States may be on the brink of 
one of the largest 
security failures in the 
lustory of diplomacy. 

After months of tak-
ing a hard line against 

orth Korea 's nuclear 
arsenal development, arti -
cles have been surfacing in 
national newspapers that the 
Bush administration may be 
shifting its focus to only the 
sale of nuclear weapons rather 
than demanding an all-out disman-
tling of the orth Korean nuclear 
program. 

If thiS happens, it won't matter 
what steps we're taking to beef up 
homeland security. In terms of pre-
venting nuclear weapon prolifera-
tion, Iraq won't maner either. The 
United States would sacrifice all the 
efforts it has made to prevent nuclear 
weaponry from getting into the 
hands of rogue states and subnation-
al actors 111 a. diplomatic moment of 
Impatience. 

It's difficult to overstate the gravity 
of the Slt1.Iatlon that would anse If 
North Korea were not coerced by the 
1I11ernaoonal community to abandon 
Its nuclear weapons program. 

Thl~ is a regime that has regularly 
bartered weapons including missiles, 
missile launchers, nuclear technolo-
gy, tunneling technology and war-
head canisters to countries in the 
Middle East, includ1l1g Syria, 
Pakistan and I ran. These deals are 
often in exchange for oil. In 
December 2002, Spanish warships 
worlung with American military and 
intelligence offiCials stopped a 
Korean freIghter found to be trans-
porting 15 scud mls iles bound for 
Yemen. JUSt last Tuesday, Australian 
authorities caught a ftshing boat 
attempting to smuggle 110 pounds of 
highly pure heroin into Sydney. Tht 
Wall Strur Journal reports that while 

be destroyed 

North 
Korea 's 

exports from 
legitimate business 

totaled only $650 
million in 200 I, its 
annual revenue from 
illegal drugs is in the 
neighborhood of 
S500 million to SI 
billion. 

Now the idea is 
being floated that 
maybe we'll just let 
North Korea have its 
nuclear program, but 
we are going to make 
sure that it doesn't 
export these weapons 
to the highest bidder 
- a1 -Qaeda or other-
wise. 

WORLD 

" 

Harvard professor 
who worked on 
Korean issues for the 
Clinton administra-
tion, said, "It's a fan-
tasy to think that you 
can put a hermetic 
seal around North 
Korea and keep them 

from getting a grape-
fruit-size piece of plu-
tonium out of the 
country." In theory, 
it's much easier for 
intelligence opera-
tives to photograph 
the movement of 
larger weapons -
like nuclear missiles. 
But even these slip 
past our watchful 
eyes. 

Right. Our intelli-
gence sources can't 
even be certain where 
in the country this 
clandestine, highly

enriched uranium program has been 
developed; that information was 
uncovered by South Korean intelli-
gence officers and Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea defec-
tors . The International Atomic 
Energy Agency inspectors sta tioned 
in the country as part of the 1994 
Agreed Framework negotiated by 
the Clinton admilllstration were 
never able to account for all the plu-
tonium rods (which, once 
reprocessed, serve as the fiSSile 
material in a nuclear warhead) and 
conjectured that the orth Koreans 
may already possess one or two 
nuclear weapons. 

This is a country roughly the 17.e 
of Pennsylvania, but we are stili 
unable to account for these larger 
pieces of the nuclear program puz7.1e. 
And now we 're proposing that we 
would have the means by which to 
prevent the sa le of plutonium to 
other groups? As Ashton Carter, a 

fered severe eco-
nomic distress since the 1980s, 
which was only accelerated by the 
fall of the USSR, several flooding 
and agricultural disasters, and 
chronic famine that have claimed the 
lives of millions. As Colin Powell 
said, "What [is North Korea ] going 
to do With another two or three 
nuclear weapons when they're starv-
II1g, when they have no energy, when 
they have no economy that's func-
tioning?" It is c lear that regardless of 
any deal struck with North Korea, 
that the regime has no incentive to 
abide by the contract. 

It 's also a historical fact. The 
linton administration and the 

North Korean regime negotiated in 
1994 the Agreed Framework. The 
framework was intended to freeze all 
nuclear weapon s development in 
return for economic aid and normal-
ization of relations, It is believed that 
the highly enriched uranium pro-
gram, to which the North Korean

government admitted last October, 
began as early as 1995. They never 
had any intention of committing to 
the agreement. 

Sympathizers with the DPRK will 
argue that the international commu-
nity, led by the United States, Japan 
and South Korea, breached the con-
tract first. In fact, the light-water 
reactors these countries were going to 
build for Korea as an alternative ener-
gy source - set to be completed by 
2003 - were still under construction 
when the North Koreans admitted to 
their highly enriched uranium pro-
gram. 

Sympathizers will also argue that 
the United States never normalized 
relations with North Korea, that the 
bar was continually moved so that the 
DPRK could never obtain equal foot-
ing. However, this ignores the four-
party summits held with North 
Korea, aimed at improving diplomat-
ic and economic ties between China, 
South Korea, the United States and 
the DPRK. 

However, these sympathizers 
ignore the fact that North Korea did 
not respond in kind with behavior 
that merited normalized relations. In 
2000, Kim Dae Jung, the then-
President of South Korea , won the 

obel Peace Prize for the first I11ler-
Korean Summit held between the two 
nations that year. But this opening of 

orth Korea ca me at a high pnce. 
Kim Dae Jung allowed IIyund31 to 
funnel $192 million to orth Korea 
m order to secure the landmark Intcr-
Korean SUml111 t. Every piece of 
progress comes with "economic aid" 
strings attached . 

And plaY1l1g the nuclear card over 
the past two decade has won dIem 
billions in extortion prizes. 

Therefore, any agreement with 
North Korea must include a verifiable 
dismantling of North Korea's nuclear 
program and cannot be limited to the 
mere prohibition of nuclear weapons 
sales.

Editor: 

On behalf of members of the

in passing the Price Center and 
Student Center Expansion 
Referendum. With a voter turnout 
of nearly 30 percent, we were able 
to show that as a student body we 
are not riddled by apathy and that 
we care about the issues that affect 
our campus. I especially want to 
thank those students who took the 
time to vote "yes" on the referen-

no or chose to abstain, I respect

In the '80s, students voted to

Presidents John F. Kennedy 
and Dwight D. Eisenhower were 
celebrated for their military capa-
bilities, perhaps more so than any 
other American presidents in the 
20th century. Commander-in-
(hief during the Cuban missile 
crisis and the leader of the 
European theater in World War 
II turned leader of the Western 
front during the Cold War, 
respectively, Kennedy and 
Eisenhower represent military 
might and foreign relations. 

But despite the fact that mili -
tary supremacy is a huge part of 
their legacies, there is not a single 
picture in the archives of history 
showing Kennedy or Eisenhower 
in military dress. And there's a 
reason for that - at the time, it 
was somewhat paramount that 
the American people would not 
perceive the presidency as being 
overly military. The U.S. govern-
ment is a civilian one - the 
responsibilities of being com-
mander-in-chief of the military is 
not the primary function. Enter 
George W. Bush and his PR stunt 
of plastering himself Onto every 
available magazine cover in flight 
gear galore, more than eager to 
be the poster boy for military 
might. 

In case you somehow man-
aged to miss the photo op that 
was all over the news, President 
Bush went all out and attempted a 
carrier deck landing, complete 
with flight suit and cameras 
galore. The former Texas Air 

ational Guard pilot was obvi-

, 

NATIONAL 
ously aiming to cement his image 
as a tough guy on terror. The idea 
to substitute a four-seat Viking 
for the usual helicopter was 
allegedly Dick Cheney's. 

And even though there is 
something funny about a guy 
who e military experience con-
sists of flying over the southern 
United States, there is also some-
thing disturbing in having a pres-
ident who is all too willing to turn 
his back on an important national 
ideal in order to confi rm his own 
would-be cowboy image. 

Just as the United States claims 
not to be an empire (never mind 
that this isn't an uncommon stance 
for a number of countries around 
the world), the American people 
do not look at their president as a 
military leader Ollt to conquer the 
planet, but rather as a domestic 
leader with international and mili-
tary responsibilities.

ture to police and regulate stan-
dards of freedom and democracy 
among other states. Whether or 
not the situation in Iraq could be 
classified as such an obligation is 
arguable. Whether or not the 
presidency should be viewed as a 
military position is not. 

Perhaps, this was a single stunt 
that was made as an early cam-
paign attempt, and it shouldn't 
merit much grumbling among 
those in the Democratic camp. 
And perhaps, this was an indica-
tion of how Bush really sees him-
self, and how the American peo-
ple should see their leader. 

There have been arguments 
that this image of a swaggering 
macho man is what the American 
people elected, that they wanted a 
John Wayne attitude in the 
White House. But perhaps those 
who would contest that Bush is 
simply fulfilling the role that he 
promised should consider 
whether or not that role is really 
one that should be embraced. 

There's little doubt that the 
incumbent has no intention of 
leaving office in 2004. And 
there's a similarly mall chance 
that most people see any prob-
lem in the president taking 
advantage of his position as com-
mander-in-chief of the military 
by parading as a fighter pilot with 
the photo op in mind . 

But miniscule or not, there is 
still a problem with publicity that 
is equitable to ego inflation. And 
there is an even larger problem 
with getting used to a blend of 
the military as well as the civic 
within the persona of the presi-
dent of the United tates.

By now, the acronym SARS is 
well known throughout the country 
and around the world. The deadly 
pneumonia-like disease has become 
a daily news item, sadly, each day 
bringing new cases and new fatali-
ties in Asian countries and else-
where. In addition, the disease has 
crippled the tourism industries and 
consequently, whole economies of 
several Asian countries. 

The University of California, 
toO, has felt the brunt of the out-
break. Students were recalled from 
srudy abroad programs, numerous 
trips have been cancelled and even 
some foreign students have been 
prevented from enrolling. This 
minor upheaval at the collegiate 
level does not hold a candle ro the 
constant fear and paranoia that 
must be infiltrating Asian nations 
and even heavily Asian communi-
ties outside of the continent. 
Amidst the tense atmosphere, the 
situation shows a variety of prob-
lems with society that have little to 
do with disease and medicine. 
Besides showing the vulnerability 
of populations to mysterious dis-
eases, the Severe Acute Respiratory 
Syndrome outbreak is a case study 
of human inepti tude, paranoia and 
i nsensi tivi ty' 

It is no secret that the spread of 
SARS was aided by the stubborn-
ness and blunder of the Chinese 
government. As a result of its 
denial of a visibly potentially dan-
gerous problem, SARS was not 
nearly as contained as it could have 
been. The disease is believed to

ment officials

WORLD 

Hong Kong feels 
unwell. The resul-
tant catch-22 puts 
the masses in a 
tough position. 
While it's perfectly 
rational to flinch 

image. Even recently, CNN 
reponed Chinese censorship of its 
coverage, criticizing the govern-
ment's cover-ups and improper 
handling that may have exacerbat-
ed the outbreak in Asia. Human 
error, pride in the form of saving 
face in an arguably still-backward 
country and continued denial 
depict the problems of China's 
government - one that is already 
known for oppression, human 
rights violations and other less 
than savory allegations. A country 
supposedly on track to become a 
superpower is still being hindered 
by its own mistakes. 

Within both the epicenter and 
the outskirts of the epidemic, para-
noia has continually manifested 
itself. News agencies routinely 
report increasing quarantines in 
outbreak areas - CNN even post-
ed pictures of empty public venues 
in Beijing as a result of the mass 
quarantines. However, even here in 
the United States, SARS has per-
meated mindsets. The Los Angtks 
Tr71UI reponed that, within Asian 
communities such as Chinatown, 
any hint of even a minor cold from 
an Asian person has caused 
bystanders to edge away. And it 

when a person of Asian descent, 
recently arrived or not, so much as 
sneezes, it's also quite unreasonable 
to eye every Asian with suspicion. 
Afrer all , documented cases within 
the United States are still few, espe-
cially compared with overseas fig-
ures. In addition. the World Health 
Organization has expressed hope in 
the increasingly favorable condi-
tions in Canada and other places. 
Like any possibly panic-inducing 
situation, the SARS outhreak is ripe 
for accusations and injustices in the 
midst of paranoia. 

If paranoia is somewhat justi-
fied, and if cover-ups and poor 
handling are unfortunate but 
understandable, insensitivity is 
pretty much inexcusable. Yet how 
many times have SARS jokes and 
comments been exchanged by 
humor-searching friends? Of 
course, even deadly diseases aren't 
immune from the verbal darts of 
Leno and Letterman. However, at 
the civilian level, continued jabs at 
humor regarding SARS hardly 
contribute to a mirthful atmos-
phere. Perhaps, I am too stiff in 
my idea of enjoyable rappon, but 
even discounting the distasteful 
value of SARS jokes, how is it 

funny making light of a disease? In 
Asian countries where whole cities 
are shut down and economies suf-
fer, not to mention the increasing 
number of deaths, joking about 
such a thing could not possibly 
conjure a smile. It seems as if get-
ting SARS would even be a fun 
event here. "Oh, you're sick? 
Maybe you have SARS!" has been 
heard more than enough. 

Of course, amidst tense and 
paranoid times, an injection of sit-
uation-related humor can be 
understood, but is not at all neces-
sary. SARS jokes sometimes seem 
to have almost become a daily 
excuse for a si lence breaker or 
conversation insertion. If any-
thing, it is disappointing to hear 
people fling around SARS like a 
catch phrase. Nobody is going to 
make fun of a cancer patient by 
gossiping about her chemothera-
py-thinned hair. SARS victims 
would probably not appreciate 
momentary amusement at their 
expense either. 

The SARS situation sprung 
onto the world scene so suddenly 
and quickly it awakened our fears 
that have been conjured through-
out the ages by the Black Plague, 
smallpox and even influenza. 
Unfortunately, it has also revealed 
flaws of people and society that 
come forth only when such a situa-
tion occurs. SARS, while by no 
means completely under control, 
looks to be at least marginally man-
ageable as some counnies report 
successful containment. Still, soci-
ety has on its hands internal dilem-
mas on a separate level that cannot 
be remedied by any vaccine. 

Pint: Irish begin to conform to their own stereotype as alcoholism grows 
conun~d from page 5 

racism is born. Ireland is no di ffer-
ent, although much to irs govern-
ment's dismay, the Irish population 
is beginning to make that stereo-
type a reality. Binge drinking is at 
an all-time high, prompting tough 
new laws to limit the power of the 
pub over the common irish citizen. 

With rumors of increased drink-
ing, a number of surveys were 
undertaken to measure the danger 
of the climb. The Western Health 
Board has S3Jd that alcohol con-
sumption has increased by 50 per-
cent over 12 years. Medical treat-
ment ranging from liver daJrulge to 
injUries from bar brawls now COSts 
about $2 .7 billion annually. Over a 
third of all emergency room patients 
suffer from alcohol-related injuries 
or illnesses. Per annum, every Insh 
citizen or resident will have an aver-
age of II liters of pure alcohol. 

Even more worrisome is the 
young age at wluch the lrish start 
drinking. Most lnsh teenagers begin 
at age 12 ; one in five of these are reg-

ular drinkers. Half of all males by 
age 15 are regular drinkers and will 
be classified as alcoholics by age 2 I. 
Even young girls, with usually more 
restraint, have numbers only slightly 
lower than their male counterpartS. 

Binge drinking is on the rise, as 
over 40 percent of adults binge 
drink. But the reasons for the 
increase are more vague. 

One of the more colorful ideas is 
that the Irish are forced to drink 
because of all the problems that 
beset their society: corrupt politi-
cians, troubles in Northern Ireland, 
the poor Iraqis and 800 years of 
English oppression. However, 
Ireland enjoys more freedom today 
than it has in the past 800 years com-
bined. Ireland has one of the fastest 
growing economies in Europe, and 
with the Celtic tiger economic phe-
nomenon still lingering, Ireland has 
one of the highest qualities of life in 
Europe. In a recent study, Dublin 
was rated the seventh-best ciry in the 
world to live in. VVhat, then, is hap-
pening to lrish health? 

There are probably several rea-
sons for this rise. One problem is 
the miserable health care system 
under the woeful leadership of 
Micheal Martin, the Minister for 
Health and Children. This week 
alone, there will be over 200 beds 
decommissioned in hospitals across 
the country. Mr. Martin recently 
told five countries that were affect-
ed by the SARS virus that they were 
not allowed to attend the Special 
Olympics this year in Ireland, 
despite the World Health 
Organization's condemnation. 
With these problems already plagu-
ing the health system, all of Mr. 
Martin s attempts to "educate" the 
public about the dangerous effeCts 
of alcohol through advertisements 
have been weak at best. 

Related to this issue is the pas-
sage of a number of inefficient laws 
regulating alcohol consumption. 
The government legislated miles of 
red tape that must be cut to open a 
new pub. Hoping to kill two birds 
with one stone, leaders thought that

by curbing new pub openings, they 
could preserve the traditional Irish 
pub and lessen drinking. llis law is 
futile; less than 10 percent of 
Dublin pubs service the alcohol 
needs of over 35 percent of the 
Dublin population and there are 
already 10,000 pubs in Ireland -
800 alone in downtown Dublin. 

Most important is that lreland 
has recently become prosperous 
after centuries of poverry, and it is 
possible that the Irish are not able 
to cope with the sudden success. 
Like the trend of lotto winners to 
immediately squander the fortune, 
it is possible that the Irish, now with 
heavier pockets, drink more 
because they are able to do so. 
Economists have criticized ireland 
for the poor handling of the Celtic 
ti ger and its end uri ng love of all 
things "lrish." This criticism is to 
be expected from any sudden explo-
sive economic growth, but it is 
based in truth. The Irish could also 
be mishandling the new freedoms 
and financial prosperity.

New laws and taxes have closed 
pubs earlier and clamp down on 
underage drinking. An ad campaign 
to stOP binge drinking has appeared 
on televisions across the country, 
and while largely ineffective, it is 
better than nothing. Regardless, 
the solution to Ireland's binge 
drinking problem will not be found 
through legislation, but through 
education. If this doesn 't work, 
drinking will decrease only if the 
population suffers enough damage 
to realize the dangers of binge 
drinlcing. 

Usually, the Irish keep true to 
their stereorype by making any 
visit to the pub a grand one, both 
through friendliness and alcohol 
accessibility, but my pint isn't sit-
ting as well tonight. I finish and 
head home for a bit of teeto-
tailing.

MONDAY. MAY 19. 2003 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Concert: Bad Religion, Mas Def perform 
continued from page I 

Students had plenty of other 
venues to expel their un God spir-
it. A gauntlet of enormolls inflat-
able slides and climbing walls occu-
pied approximately one quaner of 
the field and many stood in long 
lines to jump on trampolines or 
whirl around in carnival rides. 

Some students, however, took it 
upon themselves to stage their own 
entertainment. John Muir College 
sophomore Jessica Venturi and 
Warren senior Candice Jackman 
orchestrated an impromptu 
wrestling match, attracting much 
cheering and many spectators. 

"The match was just in the spir-
it of Sun God, and next time we 
plan to take bers," Jackman said. 
"This is definitely the best Sun 
God I've been to becallse everyone 
is partying." 

Headliners Bad Religion and 
Mas Def drew the largest crowds to 
the main stage near the end of the 
night. Ilostess Bianca Daly, who 
was running between the main and 
side stages in order to introduce 
each act, was enthUSiastic about the 
night. 

"We really couldn't have asked 
for a better night because the bands 
and students were awesome," she 
said . "Everything went really well." 

Daly was scheduled to co-host 
with Jamal Douda, but Douda left 
the concert early due to illness. 

Hana H9J/Guordian 
Infected: A crowd of students watches Bad Religion perform on the main stage 
at RIMAe field; Mos Del followed, clOSing the evening of Sun God festivities. 

Bad Religion vocalist Greg 
Graffin quipped during his orne on 
stage, calling UCSD "better than 
overrated Berkeley," the "scholarly 
UC campus." but a school that 
"still can't compare to UCLA." 

Even those comments could not 
deter the audience from cheering 
Bad Religion through its hour and 
fifteen minute set. 

Following Bad Religion, Crown 
Ciry Rockers was the last act on the 
second stage and appealed to the 
pack of Bad Religion fans to attend 

their show by calling out, "UCSD, 
come to me." The crowd listened, 
and Crown City Rockers warmed 
up the hip-hop fans for Mos Def, 
the final act of the night. 

"Overall, the night was a huge 
succe s with the second stage and 
smooth transitions," Kushner said. 
"We had non-stop music until 
I I :30 p.m., and the only thing we 
are orry about is that there was no 
DJ tent. Hopefully for next year, 
we can do both the side stage and 
the tent." 

Sun God: Booths, food, games fill campus 
continued from page I 

Ascension, Triton Twirl and Dance 
Team were among the performers. 

"[The festival] needs to be at least 
a week," said Earl Warren College 
sophomore Hanan Jammal follow-
ing a crowd-pleasing perfonnance of 
Michael Jacksons "Beat It" at the 
Karaoke Club booth. " [t s the only 
day UCSD comes alive, right here." , 

In commemoration of the festi-
val's 21 st year, the Associated 

tudents sold beer glasses, shot 
glasses, T-shirts. pencils and tem-
porary tattoos as souvenirs. 

While the unexpected deactiva-
tion of the Price Center fountain 
foiled Circle K's plans for a rubber 
ducky race, the daytime Sun God 
festivities ran mostly as planned. 

"Everything worked very 
smoothly," said Gabe Grossman, 
A.S. commissioner of program-
ming. "It was a lor of fun and a lot 
of people really enjoyed it." 

Grossman estimated that 
between 6,000 and 7,000 people 
took part in activities during the day. 

More than 80 student organiza-
tions rook the opporruni ry to 
advertise and recruit members. 

The Society for Creative 
Anachronism staged high-profile 

mock fights thsoughout the day 
between students dressed a.s war-
riors from the Middle Ages. 

Student Health Advocates chal-
lenged students to guess the num-
ber of condoms in a jar. The person 
with the clo est gue s won the 
assorted condoms. 

Political and religious groups 
did not miss the chance to increase 
visibiliry for their clubs. 

Campus Crusade for Christ 
operated a foot-washing tation 
where people could sit down and 
enjoy a one-on-one foot washing. 

On-campus vendors also bene-
fited from the large numbers of 
students attending the festival. 

At 1 p.m., the line for Round 
Table Pizza in Price Center 
stretched out the door. Supervisor 
Jenny Peraza estimated that the 
pizzeria would serve over 1,000 
people before closing. 

Private ecurity checked cus-
tomers' bags and identification 
before allowing people to enter 
Round Table. A DJ provided music 
on the patio. 

In addition to student organiza-
tions, vendors seized the opportu-
njry to advertise to the campus. 

"We're showing our fall product 

line to give everyone a preview,~ said 
Greg Nielsen, a marketing assistant 
with Simple Shoes. "We're talking 
to snldents to see what they want." 

While an overwhelming uni-
formed police presence at the event 
was not apparent, Communiry 
Service Officers patrolled the cam-
pus thsoughout the day. The festival 
prompted the UCSD police to beef 
up ecuriry. Anticipating increased 
incidents, UCSD Police doubled its 
on-dury staff. Supplemental officers 
came from San Diego State 
University, University of San Diego 
and the City of San Diego. Special 
units from the Alcohol and Beverage 
Control were also patrolling. 

"Daytime was extremely busy 
for the force, as we were patrolling 
the residence halls," UCSD Police 
Sergeant Tom Morris said . "From 
4 p.m. to 7:30 p.m., the activity 
slowed when the students made 
their way toward the concert." 

Many students added to the pec-
tacle of the festival by drinking alcohol 
before attending. Regardless, atten-
dees appeared to enjoy the actiVIties. 

"Sun God is great," Warren 
freshman Arieh Kat'l. said. "There 's 
a little tOO much drinking, but it's 
great. " 

Referendum: Fifty .. four percent vote 'yes' 
comim4td from page I 

fact what most students on this 
campus wanted," said UCETF 
chair Garo Bournoutian. "VYhen I 
initially heard the news, I was 
pleased with the results. Everyone 
on the ta k force did an ama7jng 
job with thi referendum." 

The voting week for the referen-
dum was marked by "Pro" and 
"Con" campaigns throughout the 
special election. UCAB funded the 
special elections amI provided for 
polling booths, posters and flyer 
for the UCETFS campaign and all 
other campaigns regarding the ref-
erendum. 

"ObViously we're really di ap-
pointed," aid Jennifer ohen, a 
core member of the Food Co-op 
and supporter of the "Vote 0" 
cdmpaign. "We didn't have the 
means for neces ary oUtreach 
because the neutral campaign and 
the 'Ye~' ampaign were prelty 
much the same thing and together 

they had S 1,300 to promote it. 
We're just happy that people went 
out there and voted." 

Others were also displeased with 
the results of the referendum. A 
"Vote No" campaign has been a con-
tinuing presence throughout the 
voting period. The campaign has 
brought lip issues of whether the ref-
erendum process has been student-
initiated and whether an expansion i 
necessary. According to the cam-
paign group's Wcb site, http;llstu-
dmtrolltrol.org, expansion is expen-
sive, unl1(.'Ccssary and should be a 
student-controlled projl.'Ct. 

"Thcy tried to pas the referen-
dum three, four times already," said 
Thurgood Mar hall College fresh -
man Felix Truong, a upporter of 
the "Vote 0" ampaign. "And If 
the students said no ea h time, then 
they should probahly drop it." 

According to ,allagher, other 
leps need to be taken In the expan-

sion and renovation processes to 

make sure that the referendum text 
will be followed . If any item in the 
referendum were not completed, 
students could make a case to the 
AS oW1cii and GSA to nor pay. 

"The referendum is a contract," 
Gallagher said. "If they don't deliv-
er what it ays, then student don't 
have to pay for it. That' the plain 
factual legal matter of it." 

Others have al 0 expressed the 
need for tudents to till have active 
role in ensuring that what the ref-
erendum states will be followed . 

"[ think that iI's possible if ru-
dents apply pressure in a positive 
way that they can get what they 
want," said Jon \Valton, a core 
member of the Food o-op. " I feel 
that if students apply pressure in a 
positive manner, I think they can 
get mo t of what they might want." 

Fees for the expan ion and ren-
ovatl n will nOI be collected until 
2007, when con ttu tion i approx-
imated to be compleled.

IR/PS holds Latin American Festival 
School celebrates with performances 

By CHRISTINE PAE 
Staff Writer 

The Latin American tudent 
Organization of UC D's Graduate 
School of International Relation 
and Pacific tudies treated the 
campus community to the festivi-
ties and fun of Its annual Latin 
American Festival at the IRIPS 
complex on May 15. 

FestiVIties included an authen-
tic Argentine dance performance 
from the Grupo Argentino 
Folkl6rico, Salsa dance demon-
strations, a performance by Latin 
Jazz band The Danny Green Trio 
and finished off with Capoelra - a 
Brazilian form of martial art and 
dance_ 

Apart from studying Latin 
America. Lt'lS members. aid that 
festivals like thl~ have been orga-
nized to encouragc students upon 
experiencing the culture outside of 
the classroom. 

"The significance of thiS event, 
which IS the Significance of all 
events, is that It'S a time for all snl-
dents to come logether and learn 
about the culture of the regions 
that they're studymg," said Julieta 
.,\1endez, a second-rear graduate 
student at IRIPS. "It' not some-
clung that is really focused on 111 
class, so it's a good change to learn 
aboul it and live It al the same 
time." 

LA 0 members also said that 
the festival's speclalt) is ItS concen-
tration on a parucular regIOn of the 
world. 

"ThiS event Imngs focu; toward 
a region. In thiS fe!'(lval, we focus 
attention on one of the regIOns 
that the school focuses on, which is 
Latin America," aid Rlthya Tang, 
a first-year graduJle studenl at 
I RIPS and vice pre~ldcnt of stu-
dent affaIrs 111 LASO. "So, for the 
;chool thl!t I their day, their 
moment and light."

for the IRIP school, but this does 
not hinder graduate student orga-
nizations like LASO from pUlling 
together festivals . 

"That's more of an issue sepa-
rate from what this festival is all 
about," Tang aid. "We were OUI-
voted, but we don't know the real 
reason." 

Such issues however were of no 
concern to attendant of the festiv-
ities, and to the organizers. 
According to Tang, IRiPS aims 
mostly to diffuse Larin American 
culture to the UCSD community 
and to let the IRIPS graduate 
school be better recogl1lzed_ 

Tang also noted tl13l IRiPS has 
been relatively obscure compared 
to the other graduate schools on 
campus. 

"This program has been kept a 
secret. I don't thmk a lot of people 
know about the program," lang 
aid. "ThiS fes II va I IS more about 

Latll1 AmeTica. the school in 
UCSD and to tell the communiry 
whal we're about." 

The Lalln AmeTican Fe ti\'al 
has typically been orgdlllzed by the 

I RIPS language department, bUI 
this year the e\'ent was primarily 
planned by the ;tudents. The evel1l 
wa created for exclUSively IRIP 
graduate !ltudents and anyone else 
who held interc t. 

"I" e deCided 10 kcep tillS year' 
fcstlval withm IRlPS, even though 
the language departmcnt wanted to 
expand il and possibly open Il up to 
the undergrad ." LASO Prc,ldent 
Gamaliel alazar said. 

Each year, LASO and thc 1.H1-
guage department at I RJPS orga-
nize festivals Ihal are dedicated to 
peclfic regIOns of the" orld . Thc 

Asian Festival IS held .It the lImelv 
month of February for lh~

Salazar ~ald that Ihe fc~nval wa, 
dedicated to the graduate ;lUdcnL\, 
but also to aCI as a precur or to 
other celebr.l tions. 

"\Ve fclt thal this year, we 
should keep It here 111 honor of Ihe 
15-year alulllni rcunaJll," Sal.Jzar 
~aid. "We felt thaI Ihls would be a 
good jump- t.1rl for thaI e\'enl."

student knows about cramming, 
procrastinating and pullll1g all-

the stress becomes extreme -
extreme enough to cause detri-
mental consequences? 

Extreme levels of stress can 
cau e anxiety, memory blackouts, 
phYSical illness and be factors 111 
depression, substance abuse, eating 
disorders and even suiCide. Many 
educational and medical Journals 
have recorded these troubling

By KATE LEE 

Contributing Writer 

Every student at UCSD has 
experienced the familiar survey 
passed out near the end of each 
quarter. The entire lecture hall 
bows Its heads and fills in the CIr-
cles on C.A.P. E .'~ Scanuon sheets, 
deCiding whether they Ii ked their 
professor, the class and teachang 
aSSiStants, commenong on any-
thing from the difficulty of papers 
and midterms to the eccentrlClues 
of their lecturer. 

One stud em even wrote about 
a profe sor's VOice, "The professor 
sounds like KermH the Frog. This 
puts me to sleep. I guess when I 
was young I took a nap after 
Sesame Sueet." 

How is this information used? 
The C.A.P.E. runners rerurn to 

the office and the evaluations are 
put through a scanner. A program 
designed especially for the c.A.P.E. 
office, the "c. .P.E. database," 
stores the results of the 5tatisOCS on 
the front of the CAP.E. urvey. 
The CAP.E. 5urve~ are then 
stored uy department in filang cab-
anets an their department office. 

After the grades for each cI ass 
have been turned an, both the pro-
fessor and the department can 
view their C.A.P.E. re~ullS . Fvery 
evaluaoon for every class IS orga-
nized by department and returned 
to the deparnnent where they are 
tored on file. 

h IS over the ~ul1lmer 11l0nlh\ 
that the acrual .A.P.E. hook I ~

by the CAP F .. office 10 review 
every class 's evaluation ~hects and 
to compi le comments frolll the 
back of each '.A.P.E. form. It IS 
the job of these editors to create a 

Winy and interesting paragraph 
that incorporates the comments of 
the students. 

"They are the same comments 
for pretty much every class. It's the 
eduor 's job to make them sound 
onganal so that people will read 
them," said C.A.P.E. director 
Loralyn HC}1nan. 

Each editor tallies all the com-
ments from the evaluaoons. If 10 
percent of the evaluaoons from a 
gaven class have the same comment, 
the comment will ma1.:e It anto the 
CAPE book.

"We're making headway in the 

eyes of faculty," Heyman said. 
"We continue to be funded, and 
professors who in the past have 
refused CAP.E.s are willing to 
give us another shot." 

1egan Green, rwmer coordi-
nator and future C.AP.E. director, 
ha felt the change an C.A.P.E.

- Comment from CAP.E. CAP.E. has 
come a long way 
since it began an 

1973. When C.A.P.E. first began, 
surveys were sorted by hand. Four 
yem ago, the C.A.P E. office did 
not even own I own SC3ntron 
scanner, and dUTlng the summer 
would have to wheel every survey 
down to the Prate Center to be 

~canned , after whICh the ~urvey

ulty, ~ome of whoan were diS-
pleased With the .A.P E. s~tem 
and their evaluauons. 

"There have definitely been 
some bad years 111 C.A.P.E. hmo-
ry," Ileyman said . 

Ileynun and her staff 3rc con-
fident that thiS year Will not he

Ideas for reworking the CAP I' .. 
evaluaoon form, I [eyman IS ccr-
tam that C.A.P.E. Will conunue to 
receive the upport of fa culty, 

"It was really archaiC ," 
Ilcyman said. "Wi th our reV1~cd 
budget we havc tned to reworK 
thangs to do everythang as effi -
Ciently as possible." 

Because it receives surveys 
from about 650 clas es per quarter, 
efficiency is key to the colossal fa k 
of managing the CAP.E. office. 

Even with the large budget 
cuts propo cd for next year, 
H eyman is confident that the 
C.A.P.E. program will continue to 
receive the fund ing it needs to 
publish the book. C.A.P.E. fund-
ing comes from a grant from the 
Committee for Instructional 
Improvement (ICC) that is given 
to every UC school. U SD funds 
CAP.E. with this money. 

"We are far under budget for 
the current year," I !eyman ald. "It 
assures us we can get by with less 
and shows the admJrusuaoon that 
we aren't wasting their money." 

Other changes that CA P.E. is 
looking into include reinstating the 
"Off the Wall" section of the 
CAP.E. book and the creaoon of a 
new CAP.E. survey. The new sur-
vey may even have an open section 
on it, leavi ng professors to create 
thClr own questions and receive 
feedback on their speCific questions 
that may ~rtain only to their class.

15 trust the only 
issue of anal sex? 

Miranda 
Writes ~' r 

Miranda 
Dear Miranda, 

My boyfriend and J have been 
together for three months, 
Lately, he's been hinting that 
he'd realJy like to try anaJ sex. 
He isn't pressuring me or any-
thing, but I'm not sure if I 
should do it or not. 

Do you think it's a good idea? 
AJso, if J decide to do it ... how 
will it wo rk? 

- J ana, 19 

Dear Jana, 
You 're really the only one who 

can answer your first question. Do 
you want to do it? If you did, how 
would you feel about yourself and 
your relationship? If you and your 
boyfriend have a supportive and 
loving relationship, and you don 't 
feel pressured that he'll break up 
with you for declining, there's 
nothing wrong with trying new 
things. 

Some girls are curious about 
anal sex, but worry that trying it 
will ma1.:e them deviants. To ease 
your fears, take a look at the statis-
tics. 

After you know what you're in 
for and have had a chance to 
change your mind, talk to your 
boyfriend about your deciSIOn. Set 
Out guidelines, includIng his 
promise that he 'll stop if you ask 
hIm to and his promise to wear a 
condom. 

When it comes to the actual 
event, there are several things you 
can do ro make the experience 
more comfortable for yourself. 
Make sure your boyfriend under-
sta nds the importance of taking 
things slow to avoid hurting you. 
As I'm sure you'll find from your 
research, lubrication i the key. T he 
anus isn 't an area that produces nat-
ural lubrication, and without some 
outside help, you could end up 
tearing delicate ossue. 

It might be better to starr with 
manual penetration before mov-
ing on to, um, bigger things. This 
will help accustom you to the feel-
ing of penetration, and help you 
to relax. The most important 
thing is for your whole body to be 
relaxed or penetration may be 
painful. 

ow we get back to the point 
about condoms. Even if you and 
your boyfriend are monogamous, 
STD free and practice a type of 
birth control other than condoms , 
you MUST USE A CONDOM 
FOR ANAL SEX! The latex will 
work better with whatever lubri -
cation you use (only oil-free lubri-
cants are safe with latex), making 
for a more comfortable expen-
ence. 

C.A.P.E.: Surveys help in choosing classes 

According to a srudy conducted 
at UC San Francisco, in a random 
sampling of 3,432 adults in the 
United States, 25 percent had 
experimented with anal sex at some 
point. In the arne study, a survey of 
592 students at Midwestern 
University revealed that \ 7 percent 
of sexually experienced males and 
18 percent of sexually experienced 
females had engaged in heterosexu-
al anal intercourse. 

ln the second place, unprotect-
ed anal sex is the easiest way for 
your boyfriend to pick up a nasty 
bacterial infection. And, of course, 
it's much easier to catch an STU 
through anal sex than 31ly other 
kind of sex. 

That sounds scary, doesn't it?

many buttons with the university. 
We had to tell them we were 
going to re-evaluate things and 
prove to them that we are not just 
something like Tht Koala." 

As a result of input from the 
Associated Students, faculty and 
C.A.P.E. taff, C.A.P.E. decided to 
place "Off the Wall" on a two-
year tria l hianl , excluding the 
section frOI11 both the 2000 and 
2001 CAP.E. books. This year 
marks the first year that CA P.E. 
may be able to include an "Off the 
Wall" section. 

"We are working toward a way 
to bring ["Off the Wall"] back and 
trying to satisfY people who were 
upset with it in the first place," 
l leyman said. "We want to work 
in a way that represents students 
but doesn't work against the 
adminIstration and faculty. We 
need their support roo." 

Other faculty and departments 
who have been unhappy with the 
CAP.E. book and the evaluation 
urveys, as well as "Off the Wall," 

have created their own surveys 
that are used to evaluate their 
classes. One of these professors is

"For the five year or so before 
I created my own evaluation, it 
was just becommg very obvious to 
me that the C.A.P.E. surveys were

If after careful consideration, 
you decide to try anal ex, there arc 
several things you can do to make 
sure you're prepared. The first 
thing I'd recommend is researching 
anal sex online. 

To answer your question, I ran a 
search for Uanal sex tips" on the 
online search engme Google. 
Surprisingly, no real porn Sites pre-
sented themselves. What I did find , 
however, was a lor of helpful infor-
mation and advice about the expe-
rience. In thi case, I think educat-
ing yourself beforehand will make 
for a better encounter. 

But don 't let that frighten you . All 
kinds of sex should be about 
enjoyment and sharing. 

Experimentation like this can 
help keep your ex life fresh and 
fun . If you decide to do it, there 's 
no reason why the experience 
can't be as exciting and romantic 
as any other form of sex you 
engage in. 

Best of luck.

into consideration questions that 
ask a student if they did the class 
assignments and what they thought 
of these readings or the syllabus. 
These surveys are also publ ic 
domain and are kept on file . 
Students may request to see these 
surveys, like C.A.P.E. surveys. 

"¥ou can't take it word for 
word," Heyman said. "There's 
always going to be people who like 
a different form of lecture style and 
things like that. But it is the rnost 
accurate representation anyone can 
get. No other UC system has an 
evaluation systern like ours."

"It's well -known that the reason 
tudents use C.A.P.E. is to find out 

which class has the least work," 
Woodhull said. "In term of the 
substance of the course, I don't 
think you get much from C.A.P.E. 
There. r~ally isn't much qualitative 
analYSIS. 

Woodhull said that she had 
received high ratings from previous 
C.A.P.E. surveys but had refused to 
entertain further C.A.P.E. survey-
ing to "send a signal" to the 
C.A.P.E. office. 

"I don't refuse the C.A.P.E. sur-
veys because I don't like the ratings 
Y get," Woodhull said. "I just don't 
feel the need to participate in a 
process where there are idiotic 
remarks like, 'This course sucked.' 
Could a professor do that on a stu-
dent's paper? No." 

Although some faculty may not 
approve of the C.A.P.E. book and 
its evaluation, Thurgood Marshall 
College sophomore Brie Lodter 
uses the book to choose all her 
classes every quarter. 

"I use it so I can get a feeling for 
if people liked the class or not," 
Lodter said . "Sometimes it's wrong, 
but most of the tirne it's right." 

Other students disagree that 
C.A.PE. is a helpful resource when 
picking classes. 

"I feel that they give contradict-
ing opinions," John Muir College 
junior Justin Klein aid . "They 
waste a lot of words saying cute and 
witty things that just aren't. The 
only thing that it is good for is if a 
teacher gets a I percent, then you 
know not to take him."

general it was encouraged for pro-

they are used in the consideration 
for raises and are put on a profes-
sor' record when preparing an 
applicaaon to teach interdiscipli-
nary studie in other departments 
at UCSD. For some departments at

FAQ on REEF Financing 
Question: How are Education Investments different from a loan? 

Answer: Loans are sums of money lent at interest. Education Investments 
are sums of money disbursed to students at no interest. The 
obligation of an Education Investment is based on a fIXed percentage 
of future income for a fixed period of time. This program allows 
flexibility in obligation according to your economic situation. 
Which means, you pay less when you have less and more when you 
have more. 

Question: Can these Education Investments pay for all of my tuition? 
Answer: Education Investments are a great complement for students that 

have already received grants, scholarships and federal loans, but 
still need more money for their living costs. REEF can help students 
fill the gap between what you have and what you need. REEF will 
fund a maximum of $7000 for cost of living expenses per school 
year. 

Question: How does this affect my Financial Aid package? 
Answer: Education Investments will not affect your Financial Aid package. 

REEF works closely with the Financial Aid Office and the Student 
Business Office at UCSD to ensure Education Investment 
disbursements fit into your cost of living package. As opposed to 
increasing the amount of loans you are responsible for, you now 
have an alternative way to finance your education that's more 
sensitive to your future ability to pay. 

Question: How are these percentage rates determined? Will they change 
throughout the life of the obligation? 

Answer: Percentage rates begin: 
0.1 % for graduate students (l/10 of one percent) 
D ,~/a for undergraduate students (l /5 of one percent) 

Rates are specifjc to each applicant. Education Investments are 
awarded on a case-by-case basis. The more Information a student 
gives REEF, the more accurately a rate is determined. Students are 
encouraged to mfonn REEF about their goals, career plans, mternships, 
major, test scores, CPA and anything else they think is relevant 
regardmg their future .

Kenrick Leung in rhe UCSD CuGrdion, Oct 24. 2002 

School of Medicine, 
Medical Teaching 
Facility, Rm 175 

In the early 1970's, when 
QU IN CY TROUPE was an adjunct faculty member at the College of 
Staten Island, someone told him that he would never be hired as a 
tenure-track professor unless he had a bachelor's degree. I Ie had 
attended Grambling, but not graduated. I Ie changed hiS resume to 
say that he had graduated from Gramhllrlg. 

Over the years, high accomplishments and fame Irlcrca~eu, lnd he 
held several prestigIOus teaching positions. I Ie became UCSD\ 
brightest literary star-popular lecturer, nationally renowned poet 
and author, as well as a gifted teacher who gave back to the com-
munity. I Ie accepted a prestigIOUS nOllllnatiOn as Cahforl1lJ 's Poet 
Laureate, but sta te legislature staffers discovered the lie. I Ie With-
drew hiS nOlTIlrlation as Poet Laureate, and eventually reSIgned 
frorn UC D as well. 
This moral mme field will be negotiated by LAWRENCE 

HINMAN , a Univer ity of San Diego Philosophy profes or and

SENIOR SENDOFF 

Golf loses lone senior to graduation 
Schneider will be missed as golfer, sportsman 

ByIOESPANO 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD golf team, which 
finished its season with a tie for 
sixth place in the National 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
Division II Western Super 
Regional tournament on May 7, 
will lose to graduation this year its 
lone senior Blake Schneider, who 
will be missed as an essential play-
er and great leader. 

"Blake was one of the best play-
ers on the team," said head coach 
Mike Wydra. 

chneider competed in nearly 
hal f of the tournaments for the team 
this year and his best fi lllsh of the 
year wa 22 ml place, which came in 
the POlllt Loma I nvlta tional on

"I played for the team all four 
years, and it was ju t an awesomc 
experience," Schneider said. "I real-

Iy enjoyed the camaraderie and just 
hanging out with the team. We all 
got along really well.» 

Now that the season is over for 
Schneider, he laments that there will 
be no more practices, but says he 
will definitely be rooting for the 
team next year. 

"Before this season, Blake had 
trouble includ-
ing hook or 
draw into his 
shots," Wydra 
said . "But last 
summer, he 
learned how to 
move the ball 
left and nght ,

40 yards farther

rhe highest-qual ity tOurna ments. 
We Will really miss his brand of 
competitiveness and leadership that 
he brought to thc team." 

chnetder, who came to UC D 
when it was still a Division III 
school, noted the difficulty that 

came with switching to Division II 
in his sophomore year. However, he 
was happy with how successful the 
team has been in the past three 
years, making it to regional twice-
a rare feat for a nonscholarshjp 
school. 

"Some of the best times in my 
four years were the road trips, just 
riding up to places like Davis and 
Bakersfield in the team van; we 
always had a great time as a team. 
Also, coming from Northern 
California, it was great to have an 
adult-like coach like Wydra down 
here in San Diego. He would always 
be there for us, even invi ting players 
over for dinner on occasion," 
chneider said. 

Wydra had only good things to 
say about Schneider and recalled 
that at one tournament tlus year, 
Schneider offered to give up hiS spot 
m the tournament to a fellow golfe r 
for the good of the team, somethjng 
Wydra had never een in all Ius 
years of coaclung. 

"We couldn't have accomplished 
anything we did this sea on without 
Blake," Wydra said. 

Sendoff: Women's water

themselves as a "cohesive unit." 

"\Ve all have equally important 
parts. It's not like were relying on 
only one or two people to get the 
job done ... we all work together," 
Silvem13n said. 

In fact, the seven scruors are the 
be t of friend , talang something 
that could have been limited only 
to the pool and letting it blossom 
IntO a mle friendship. 

"Yeah, we do lots of thJllg, 
together; nOt just practi cing, but 
hanging out," Lyman said . 

Tne thriving sense of team-
work among the group ha; been a 
stapl e for succe , carrying the 
tcam, especially in btg games. 

"Every big game that we played 
... was a big team effort, " Boyle 
said. "We played \vith each other a 

a group, rather than a bunch of 
individuals ... 

As serious as their demeanor 
was in the pool, humor reigns king 
among the group. 

"\,ve always joke around, we're 
loud and we like It that way. We 
even have a senior 'pose' that we 
made to be cure," Bourret said. 

\Vhen each senior goes their 
own sepa ra te way a fre r college, it 
is not the sport that ther WI ll miss 
the most, but the relaoomhlps 
they have made because of It. 

''I'm gOing to mIss spendmg 20 
hours with everybody, practicing 
and sitting for hours at the Geisel 
Library ba~emcnt," Lyman aid. 

As the UCSD seruors ride off 
into the SW1Set, they leave a t:1n-

playoffs 

o Knows 
Owen Main 

F or the entire BA season, many UC D students who are BA fans waited for the 
lIlevitable: a rematch of last sea-
son's epic Laker vs. Kmgs \Vestern 
Conference Final. La t week, bom 
, orCal dnd oCal students' hope 
were crushed when bOth the 
Lakers and Kmgs wcre knocked 
out of the playoffs. 

Lakers' fans had always put me 
"barnng IIlJury to one of our ke~' 
gu} .. disclaimer II1to their asseroons 
that mey'd bnng home a fourth 
champlOnslup III a row. For them, 
the playoff came down to twO foot 
IIlJunes at the ,arne pesloon, a hlg 
man who hasn 'l been thJS lI1eflecO\ c 
slIlce (well, a long as I can remem-
ber), a three-polllter that wouldn't 
go down, and an M\ 'P and Coach of 
the Year who pro\'ed they deserved 
their respective awards tlus season. 

Irony threw a wrench IIlto 
Kings' fans' hopes who have alway 
quesooned the Lakers' depth or 
what would happen if Shaq or 
Kobe were to get hurt. TheIr MVP 
candidate, ChriS Webber, went 
down III the middle of their serre 
and with him, went much of ilie 
fight and hope of WInning. 

The Kmgs were more prepared 
to deal ~th the loss of Webber then 
the Lakers would be to deal Wlth me 
loss of Shaq or Kobe, but the hot 
shooting of one fOn11er Laker guard 
coupled Wlth the ineffectiveness of 
another WithOut Ius low-post mate, 
proved the undolllg of the Kings. 

A:, one Kmgs fan put It, "My 
only consolation IS that If the KlIlgs 
didn't win It, the Lakers didn't 
either." 

So the Laker~-KlIlgs "rivalry," IS 
apparently strong. But, as the 
team, rom 'H:xas proved, sOllie of 
the rest of the league has now 
caught up \:\ 'hen the Lakers won 
the championship III 2000, they 
were head and shoulders above the 
rest of the ICJ!(ue. They proved It 
once again 111 ~0()1 , swecplllg their 
way IIlto the finals and loslIlg only 
one IlOsL,cason game . 

Hut a funny thlllg happens when 
you're successful in profeSSional 
spom the~c days: -I cams catch up 
"1th you. -l1,e first team to catch up 
to the Lakers was the KlIlgs la\t sca-
'>On. TIllS scason, both Oallas and 
San AntollJo proved iliat they have 
learned frolll the beaongs they've 
taken o\'er tlle past threc ~easons, 
and now one of them Will almost 
undoubtedly take home the utle. 

The Lakers w.Il retool. ' Ialks of 
Scottie Pippen and Karl Malone 
abound while they also need mure 
youth and athletiCism on their ros-
ter. 

For the KlI1gs, they'll go back to 
Sacramento with baSically the same 
players and chalk thiS season up as 
bad luck . But there must be a pre-
valllllg thought that, If It didn't 
creep lilt their collective heads 
before, it must now. Will thl 
KIng team ever Will the 
Championship) Or will they sim-
ply turn Into the Utah J 37.7. of the
