Low Turnout Notwithstanding 

'Third' Backed As Official Name 
Despite Previous Council Stand 
By Monet Payton 

Staff Writer 
The Third College student 

council voted thr to one . 
yesterday morning in favor of 
submitting the name "Third" to 
Chancellor McElroy's naming 
committee. 

The full council, composed of 
six faculty and six students, had 
previously decided that the 
name would be submitted only if 
there was a 50 percent turnout 
of both faculty and students in a 
yes·no election held last week. 

While there was a 60 
percent turnout of the faculty, 
only 25 percent of the Third 

College students voted . Faculty 
and students favored the name 
"Third" by a three to one 
margin. 

Because there was no 
quorum of the faculty at 
yesterday's meeting, there will 
be another meeting of the full 
council Friday morning in order 
to discuss whether the name will 
be submitted . However, since 
60 percent of the faculty voted 
last week, it was assumed that 
this was their voice. 

Ther~fore, it is unlikely t~at 
the decision to submit the na me 
will be reversed, according to 
College Council a lternate Jules 

Naming Boy~ott Group 
Claims Some Success 

I A loosely.formed coalition of five people that didn't even have a 
name until asked for one by a Daily Guardian reporter says it has 
played a role in keeping the Third College Council from getting the 
election turnout it wanted in last week 's naming vote. 

Although the "Lumumba.Zapata Movement Committee" has 
only been formed over the last several weeks, Mark Escajeda, an 
AS representative from Third, says his group helped keep the Third 
College Council from getting the election turnout of 50 percent it 
wanted. 

According to Escajeda, feelings in favor of the name have been 
substantial over the ten year history of the College, but have been 
limit ed in their effect by both a ttrition a nd graduation. 

He stre ses that the Commille is "not as organized as everyone 
thinks it is ." Thp. l.ommillpp ronsists of about fi ve members, but 

Carlos Montalvo, AS 
President, who supported the 
boycott of the Third naming

The naming of the group 
itself as the Lumumba ·Zapata

Bagneris, a student. 
Bagneris , who can only vote 

in case of ties , walked out of the 
meeting yesterday because of 
his disagreement with the way 
this subject is being handled. 

"The total disregard of 
student interest throu g h 
unethical practice, non · 
productive methods , and so· 
called 'democratic pa rti ci· 
pation ,' indicates that student 
government is a minor concern 
to Third College admini· 
stration ," said Bagneris. 

Arturo Herrera, head of the 
"Lumumba·Zapata Movement 
Committee," agrees with 
Bagneris. 

He says that the Third 
College Council is "continuing 
what has been going on in the 
election so far. .. they say one 
thing and then do another ." 

He adds tha t the 25 percent 
turnout shows that students 
actively boycolled the election 
last week. They "showed their 
rejection of the election as a 
whole because of the way it was 
done. " 

Sung Choe, a Third College 
ounci l member who voted in 

favor of submitting the name 
"Third" ,sa id "i t is ridiculous to 
have another elec tion when 
people supported the na m

" W e h ope tha t the

He also comme nted tha t they

Nuclear Power 
Risks Hard 
To Ascertain 
Four Scientists Debate, Disagree 
On Implications of Three Mile Leak 

By Kathy Huffer 
Associate News Editor 

Assessing the risk of nuclear power is impossible at present 
because " there haven 't been enough accidents to tell," said UCSD 
physics professor William Thompson at a well·attended nuclear 
debate last night. 

Thompson, along with three other California scientists, spoke 
out on nuclear energy in the CalPIRG sponsered debate was 
more than two and a half hours. 

The scientists frequently disagreed, and each had the support of 
some of the between 150 a nd 200 people attending the Third 
Lecture Hall program. 

Much of the'discussion and debate centered on the recent Three 
Mile Island nuclear accident , which resulted in the partial 
evacuation 01 Harrisburg, Pennsylvania residents after trouble in 
one of the nuclear reactors there posed the threat of a core 
meltdown. 

" I see no reason why it shouldn't happen again ," AI Sweedler 
Associate Professor of Physics at CSU Fullerton said of t~ 
Harrisburg disaster. 

Thompson , though, believes that " nuclear safety will be 
improved (as a result of Three Mile Island ) because now we know a 
nuclear accident can happen." 

During the debate , which was moderated by Channel 39 
anchorwoman Carol Hutchinson, the scientists a lso argued about 
the future of nuclear power. 

Sweedler strongly advocated further research and development 
of solar energy as a more " benign and humane" source of future 
ene.rffY supplies becau e of its fl exibi lity and because energy 
deCISions could then be made on a local , "different kind of 
democratic level." 

Calling nuclear reactors " too cotton.pickin' expensive," Norman 
Dessel , Professor of Natural Sciences at San Diego State, a lso 
supported solar energy, explaining that "solar is with us-it's not 
something tha t's a matter of the future."

Political Science Asks 
for Doctoral Program 

By Pat Domowitz 
Staff Writer 

The newest and a pparently 
fas test growing department on 
ca mpus ha s sub mitted a 
proposal which would a llow 
UCSD to begin offering a Ph.D 
in political science beginning in 
1980 , according to department 
head Sa nford Lakoff . 

Lakoff said one of the major 
factors which has a llowed the 
department , only five years old , 
to propose the new program is 
the appointment of four new 
faculty members, effective next 
year. 

"W e haven 't offered a Ph.D 
before because we haven 't had 
the necessary critical mass of 
faculty before," Lakoff said. 

"But wi th the new addi tions, I 
believe we hav reach d that 

ri ti ca l rna 's, parti c ularly 
considering the out tanding 
qualifications of the new facu lty. 
We may not be as large as 
Berkeley or UCLA , but we 
ha ve a formidable , young 
faculty and we are ready to offer 
a proper Ph .D," he said. 

The four n w appointments 
- one full profes or, one 
assistant and two a sociates-
include peciali ts in M xico, 
comparativ politi c and 
American politics, filling in 
some gaps in the departmental 
offerings and strengthening 
others. 

Prof. Wayne Cornelius, a 
Stanford graduate, and A st. 
Prof. Ann Craig of M.I.T., his 
wife , both are specialists in 
Mexican politics. Cornelius has 
specialized in migration and 
immigration problems and will 
head a major conference in La 
Jolla next week on immigration 
of Mexicans to the US. Craig 
has specialized in the Mexican 
land reform movement. The 
two will combine teaching here 
with running an independent 
institute for M exica n · 
Americans. 

Associate Prof. Peter A. 
Gourevitch, a Har vard 
graduate, will add hi expertise 
in comparative politics within 
W es t rn urope to the 
department 's s tron ges t 

on en t ra tion . Currently 
teaching a t Canada's McGill 
University , Gourevitch has just 
publi hed a book on the reform 
of Fren h local government.

Rec Center Idea is 111-
Planned, Unnecessary 
Editor: 

Th. week .tudent. are being 
asked to approve a recreation 
center fee that will run for 25 
yean at $5 per quarter per 
. UCSD students will liote 
tomorrow arid Thursday on the 
recreation center proposal. 

.tudent. The facility would 
include a pool. two jacuzzis. 
racquetball-handball courts. a 
shower and locker room and 
night lighting for Muir Field. 
The la.t item is especially 
needed. 

However. the proposal 
auffer. from major deficiencies. 
Cnef among these is lack of 
thought. 1l1e proposal allows 
tolally ludicrous figures for 
facility maintenance, ludicrous 
because they are 10 pitifuUy 
arnall. In order to keep this 
center operating UCSD will 
either have to raise the fee or 

AS Flag 
Editor: 

It has come to my attention 
that the ASUCSD Council has 

li~ed within the proposed 
budget of Jamie Montgomery, 
director of public relations, a 
proposal for the production of 
an ASUCSD flag . This is 
ludi c rous , pompous and 
pretentious_ 

While as a graduating senior, 
I will not ha ve to see this flag , I 
say to all those who will be here 
next year: If you see such a flag, 
bum it. 

Jonathan Osborn 

raise regi.tration fees, and reg 
fees are already too high. 

In addition, questions of 
priorities enter into the question. 
Are more rec facilities essential 
in view of declining enroUments, 
scarcity of funds . and the 
desperate need for expanded. 
affordable student housing? 
Could the money be better spent 
elsewhere? 

This proposal has been voted 
on before, and if defeated this 
week it will undoubtedly be 
voted on again_ Why? Because 
the administration wants this 
facility badly. It has been 
pushing ij for over three years 
now. and this is but the latest 
attempt to get it accepted. No 
students were involved in those 
initial plans; they're window 
dressing now. added after the 
original proposal's 3-1 defeat in 
March, 1977. 

Ths year they're holding the 
referendum in the tenth week, 
allowing very little advance 
warning and generally working 

' to limit turnout to supporters. 
People I've talked .to in the PE 
department have told me that 
they don't expect to meet 
minimum turnout this year, but 
they do expect a positive vote. 
one which can be used next year 
in their campaign. 

Don't give it to them. Reject 
this ill-conceived proposa l. 
Don'tlet them get away with it! 
Don ' t accept half-baked 
schemes to squander rare 
student monies.

UCSD Needs Extra Rec Facilities 
Editor: 

Mark Troll IS Inaccurate in 
his arguments over the 
proposed student recreation 
facilities_ 

The proximity of the chilling 
Pacific Ocean notwithstanding. 
many students use the UCSD 
swimming pool for their daily 
physical activity. Included in 
this array of swimmers are 
many off-campus residents. 
some of whom are not fortunate 
or affluent enough to afford a 
pool of sufficient size for a 
workout. Time to use any 
recreation facility is not an 
obstruction for any of us. no 
matter how busy we are . 

As a stude nt. I will not 
pretend to be knowledgeable 
about the operation and 
organization of the PE 
department. However, there are 
many, many students I have 
talked to today who are upset 
that Mark ridicules the 
outstandin g intramural 

program a t UCSD. The mere 
ment ion of elimination of a sport 
such as coed innertube water 
polo is shocking - what next , 
coed softball? 

As a female non-intercol-
legiate person , I have found 
support and encouragement in 
intramural participation a nd in 
acti vity classes tha t the PE 
department offers. Thus, I am 
now an active proponent of 
sports, fitness and recreation for 
each student, regardless of 
ability or experience. 

Obviously, Mark did not 
study the recent le tter by the 
Student Recreation Facilities 
Committee. If he had , he would 
ha e observed tha t the critical 
need for more faci lities, 
especia lly racquetball-handball 
courts and a swimming pool, is 
now and not as a guard against 
increased enrollment. The 
referendum is recommended to 
alleviate existing crowding, not 
same distant future need. 

I see no short-sightedness in 
assessing crowded swimming 
conditions and concluding that 
an additional pool is needed ; 
rather , this is long-sightedness 
a nd consistent with the efficient 
planning a nd concern of the 
student com millees that 
forwa rded the referendum. 

I do not begrudge Mark his 
opinion or priority o n 
recreation. In fact. I praise him 
for his intere st in th e 
referendum . However, his 
arguments are weak a nd 
inaccurate. 

I as k all students to read the 
voter information' sheets readily 
available at a ll likely student 
congregation areas (call EDNA 
if you need one). Vote on this 
important issue - naturally, I 
feel that a YES vote is desirable. 

If you are in favor of physicaf 
fitness and recreation and of 
student control over student-
funded facilities, vote YES.

Teachers Have' Personal Interests, Too 

Professors Stab at Democracy-And Miss 
By John H. Taylor 

S ince no one hal told you. the Academic Senate is not a senate at aU. It is 
not an a.sembly of 

lawmakers. Someone on the 
faculty compared it to a 
p.arliament, and said its ar,ti-
William McElroy vote was like 
a no-confidence vote in a prime 
mini.ter_ The analogy i. no 
good. 

Teacher. serve here at the 
pIea.ure of the administration, 
not the other way around. The 
administration is in.talled by the 
UC president, who an.wers to 
Sacramento and the taxpayer •• 
Teacher. are public servant •• 
not policy makers. Their 
expertise is in re.earch and 
instruction, not politic •. 

Hardly anyone ever goes to 
"senate" meeting._ 1l1e vote of 
no-confidence in the Chancdlor 
repre.ented well leu than half of 
the ".enator._" Mo.t 
reaponaible public bodies would 
not even hold a buaineu 
meeting ~th so few members. 
bec:aule they realize any 
decision made and publicized 
could give an incorrect 
impteuion of the inclination of 
the full memberlhip. 

Here the "senate" is run 
diHerentiy. A Itraw vote ia held 
in public, folowed by a leu 

dramatic but more accurate 
mail ballot to all 805 members. 
Though past practice indicates 
that the fuD vote could bring 
different results. the. goals, 
headlines and an embarrassed 
chancellor, are already 
achieved. " No confidence in 
McElroy" i. burned into the 
public's sensibilities before a 
legitimate vote is ever recorded. 

. Richard Nixon and Gov. Brown 
never manipulated the media 
better. 

Teachers .ay they di.like the 
smell of politic. that i. about. 
One said that "lobbying (for or 
against McElroy) is for a 
different world_ You don't 
invite academics in for a drink 
and change their mind._" The 
".enator.," then, are 
.. academic.... the calm 
beneficiaries of the age of 
reason. The .uggestion is they 
have no per.onal intere.t. to 
protect, like the a.cetic 
guardian. in Plato's Republic. 
and have left UI behind in the 
"different world" of con.tantly 
.hifting social preuurea that is 
democracy. 

Their disdain wa. reRected in 
the infonnality of the gore -
McElroy meeting. Chainnan 
RUII Doolittle ran the show, 
resplendent in an open.necked, 
Ihort_ IleeWld shirt. without 

paying attention to whether all 
the people casting ballots were 
professors. One is thus further 
discouraged about whether the 
resulting vote was even the least 
bit legitimate. The exact vote 
wasn't important, said Doolittle; 
what was important was the 
faculty's "emotionalism_" Good 
God. 

The . "senate" has not 
specified its claim of ongoing 
neglect of faculty views by 
McElroy. though McElroy has 
specified over 200 faculty 
consultations this year. He drew 
the line, he said, at such is.ues 
a. whether faculty kids should 
be bounced from the student 
and· taxpayer-funded daycare 
center. And, yes, that action 
angered lome teacher., though 
I never understood their claim to 
free babysitting. 

What probably happened 
Ia.t week is that teachers were 
frightened by McElroy' •• udden 
and . apparently ill-timed 
administration .huffle, Many 
(JfOfeuor. like Vice Chancellor 
Paul Saltman, Lot. of them gol 
their job_ through him. He is 
also an outlpoken champion of 
academic excellence, and · 
alway. was during a time when 
the academic world often carne 
elOIe to aub.tituti.. trendineu 
for IChoIar.hip, He hal also 

helped build first -rate 
departments , and is more 
insistent upon quality teaching 
in addition to research skills 
than he gets credit for. McElroy, 
in turn, is good at community 
relations and the all-important 
scienc'e of grantsmanship. 

So what exactly were these 
men and women voting on? 
What (so far unrevealed) 
pattern of neglect led to such 
ontoward extremism? What , 
besides politics and self-interest, 
drew them together to try to end 
a man's career three years 
early? If they walt until after the 
fact to specify their charges, 
they will have treated a 
chancellor with Ie.s professional 
respect than the university 
would give to a line-item 
grounds keeper who was about 
to be fired. 

The whole thing drips with 
politics. Doolittle took to the 
phones last week like a bookish 
Kissinger to reconcile the 
feuding administrators . 
Saltman is in his office, his 
duties restored . but no one' has 
done anything about the 
personality clash that 
precipitated the crisis. Canning 
or publicly embarrassing one of 
the personalities were never the 
smart options_ 

The Academic Senate should 
not be expected to choose 
among the smart options. 
Classical democracy depends 
on the notion that ignorant 
individuals can muster wisdom 
beyond the sum of their parts 
when they assemble. The 
function goes the other way in 
this case; the "senators" are 
individually wise. coUeCtively 
dumb_

Vorster Forced Out 

JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -
President John Yorster, a dominant fi gure in South

Among the biggest expenditures in the secret fund , 
according to Ihe report, was $ 11.35 million allegedly 
loaned to Michigan publisher John P. McGoff for 
efforts to buy the Washington Star, the Sacramento

"Based on our experiences to da te, these matters

CHP Angry at Sickout 

SACRAMENTO (AP) - Glen Craig, head of the 
California Highway Patrol, said yesterday he would 
not condone a scheduled sick.out by CHP officers 
seeking more pay than Gov. Edmund Brown, Jr. has 
offered. 

Craig was reacting to a call by the California 
Association of Highway Patrolmen, which claims to 
represent 95 percent of the force, for officers to stage a 
sickout every weekend beginning this Saturday. 

Brown is offering a 10.5 pay a nd fringe increase 
package, a nd the association wants 20.6 percent, 
ci ting the fact that CHP officers, like other state 
employees, recieved no pay raise last year. 

The CHP commmissioner said every sick leave 
claim would be investigated and administrative 
ersonnel would be used to sta ff patrol cars on the 
highways if necessary. He refused to say whether 
officers participating in the sickout would be fired. 

Radar for CHP? 
SACRAMENTO (AP) - Brown administration 

offi cials, citing the gas shortage and need for fuel 
conservation, said yes terday they would again push 
for use of radar in California Highway Patro l cars. 

But Gray Davis, Gov. Edmund Brown, Jr.'s chief of

a $3 million federal grant to pay for the radar only If 
the Legislature agrees to put the proposal in the state 
budget. -

Davis sa id Preside nt Ca rter . through Charles 
Warren, his energy liason in Ca lifornia, asked the

*Thll II an all-student referendum to construct, maintain and operate -new student recreation 
facilities consisting of a swimming pool with jacuzzl ,. racquetball courts, night lighting on the Muir 
field, and a jacuzzi at the Natatorium . . 
The construction cost Is $1,006,000 which will come from a Regents' loan for that amount. has an interest rate of 
9.5 % and is repaid over a 25-year period at $106.595 per year. The loan is secured by a mandatory 
$5/quarter/student fee which also provides maintenance and operating funds. Based on 10,000 students, there is 
a minimum of $43,405 per year for maintenance and operation. Additional Income comes from non-student user 
fees and rent when school is not In session (e.g .. Summer). , 
All costs were researched by the UCSD Architects and Engineers Qffice and the Capital and Space 
Management Office. 

No fees will be collected until the Facilities are ready for student use. in Fall 1981 . 

There are no additional use fees for registered students. 

Non-students must pay a use fee. 

The student fee will be included in student fee scholarships and grants via Student Financial SeNices. 

The student fee may be changed only by a direct all-student vote. 

At the end of the 25-year debt retirement period, there will be a direct all-student vote to approve the fee level 
for continued maintenance and operation. 

The question will appear on the ballot as follows: 

Shall the Students of the Unillersity of California at San Diego aHess themseilies a fee of $,.00 per quaTter per student for the sole 
purpose of ronstnccting, maintaining, and operating Sludent Recreation Facilities consisting of a swimming pool , ja04Zzi , fille

nighl lighting on the Muir Field, said Facilities to be gO\leTned by the Student Recreation Facilities ChaTter? 

The size of the new pool is 25 yds X 25m. Each jacuul is 15' In diameter. The racquetball courts are standard size 
20' X 40'. The locker room has 100 dressing and 500 storage lockers. Solar heating and natural ventilation are

ASUCSD, the GSC, and each College Council. and 3 non-voting consultants. The Facilities annual budget report 
is public and must be submitted to the ASUCSD. the GSC, each College Council. and the consultants.

Escajeda says. He adds, " if

The Committee staged a 
boycott of the naming election 
lasl week. 

I! was supported by AS and 
e thnic organization officials 
from across campus, inciuding 
AS President Carlos Montalvo. 

According to Escajeda, this 
boycott was partially 
responsible for the low (25 
percent) student turn-out , far 
short of the 50 percent goal the 
College Council set. 

The Committee now intends 
to "follow up" on the boycott by

Brown Asks Carter to Veto 
Los Alamos Appointment 

SACRAMENTO (AP) - Gov. Edmund Brown, Jr. asked 
President Carter by telegram yesterday to block the 
appointment of Donald Kerr as director of the University of 
California's Los Alamos Laboratory , one of two UC nuclear 
labs. 

Kerr is accused by Brown and other critics of being a foe of 
nuclear disarmament. Brown opposed Kerr 's recent 
appointment by the Regents but was outvoted. 

Every major U.S. nuclear weapon has been developed at the 
Los Ala mos and Livermore labora tories, run by the university 
on a federa l contract. Brown has called for UC to sever ties with 
Los Ala mos and convert Livermore to non-weapons research.

Political Science Grows 
Offers Doctoral Degree 

(Continued from page 1) 
Associate Professor Gary J . 

Jacobson , a Yale graduate, 
brings a special ty in American 
Politics with him from Trinity 
College in Hartford , Conn., 
where he recently published a 
book on campaign financing . 

The additions will allow the 
department to offer strong 
concentrations in comparative 
politics and Scien ce, 
Technology and Public Affairs 
to prospe c tive graduate 
students, while also covering the 
other a reas of the discipline , 
Lakoff said. 

He said the proposal a lready 
has received local approval, but 
still lacks the Regents' sanction, 

although that approval IS 
expected by midsummer. 

"We will begin to advertise 
the program this summer," 
Lakoff said, with an eye toward 
admitting the first graduate 
students in Fall 1980. The 
initial class probably will be 
limited to five students, he said, 
and will be taught on a tutorial 
basis. 

Students will be expected to 
complete a two· year residence 
then complete a thesis within 
two to three years. 

"We 're starting small, but 
we'll build as we gel bigger," 
Lakoff said . " I think that we'll 
be competitive regardless of 
size. We have a lot to olfer."
