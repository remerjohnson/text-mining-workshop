Speaking at the event, which 
concluded his systemwide inaugu-
ration tour that began soon after 
he took office in October 2003, 
Dynes said his fight for outreach 
funding was only a small part of 
the financial challenges the uni-
versity faced in his first year on the 
job. 

"r realized that I had to look at 
the future of the university-look 
10 or 20 years up - but I also 
realized that I had to stop this 
bleeding, or else this university 
would become just another uni-
versity," he said, referring to a 
budget compact signed with Gov. 
Arnold Schwarzenegger last 
spring that promised more state 
money after three years of budget 
cuts. "As I said to the governor, if 
the University of California 
becomes just another university, 
the state of California will become 
just another state. And that actual-
ly rang through to him." 

For Dynes, who first joined the 
university in 1991 as a UCSD 
physics professor after a private 
career, and then served as the 
campus' chancellor prior to his 
move to the top position at the 
university, the tour concluded at 
the very place that launched his

UC career. 

"Coming back to San Diego is 
coming home for Bob," 
Chancellor Marye Anne Fox said. 

During a question-and-answer 
portion of the meeting, Earl 
Warren College Freshman 
Senator Matt Herrick asked 
Dynes what the university could 
do to increase minority enroll-
ment in the aftermath of a voter-
approved ban on affirmative 
action in the 1990s. 

"The student population of the 
University of California really 
doesn 't look like the rest of 
California," Herrick said. "If you 
walk around campus, you see a 
surprising lack of minorities." 

In response, Dynes said he 
hoped to use the university system 
to improve low-performing high 
schools, and described a 10-year 

plan to bring in more highly qual-
ified math and science teachers. 

"If you asked, I would like to 
use affirmative action, but it's 
against the law," he said . "I would 
put it back tomorrow. But what's 
happened since Proposition 209 is 
that we've looked at other ways to 
increase diversity." 

During Dynes' meeting with 
UCSD alumni later in the day, 
Local 3299 of the American 
Federation of State, County and 
Municipal Employees Union held 
a candlelight vigil to appeal to the 
president in its ongoing contract 
negotiations with the university. 

"President Dynes is the top 
decision-maker in the UC system 
- top enough to meet with Gov. 
Schwarzenegger," said union

Regents approve bid for Berkeley lab 
Board makes no decision on two other facilities 

ByUSAMAK 
Associate News Editor 

The UC Board of Regents has 
approved UC President Robert C. 
Dynes' proposal to submit a com-
petitive bid for the continued 
management and operation of the 
Lawrence Berkeley National 
Laboratory. T he vote will allow 
Dynes to submit a proposal on 
behalf of the university to the 
Department of Energy by the Feb. 
9 deadline. 

The Energy Department owns 
the Berkeley lab, along with the 
Los Alamos National Laboratory 
and the Lawrence Livermore 
Nationa l Laboratory. The 
University of California has man-
aged the labs for more than 50 
years. A law passed in 2003 man-
dated that the labs seek competi-
tive bids for management rights 
for the first time in history. 

The current management con-
tract for the Berkeley lab will 
expire Jan. 3 I. 

"The University [of) California 
has managed the Berkeley lab 
since its inception in 1931, and 

that laboratory we are all vety 
proud of," Dynes said at the 
regents' Jan. 20 meeting. "It has 
experienced enormous success 
under the university's manage-
ment and is a jewel in the scientif-
ic crown of the United States." 

While the Los Alamos and 
Livermore labs perform nuclear-
weapons research and design, the 
Berkeley lab is a civilian-based 
facility that does not perform any 
classified military research. 
Projects at the Berkeley lab 
include research on dark matter, 
the human genome and high-per-
formance computing. 

"When one looks over the 
horizon to the furure of science 
over the next 20 years, this work is 
going to be very exciting," Dynes 
said. "I personally look forward to 
watching science at the Berkeley 
lab and the relationship with the 
Berkeley lab and the rest of the 
nation." 

The Energy Departme;-at has 
specified that if th uOlversity 
wants to make a proposal, it must 
agree to certain non-negotiable 
terms, including the department's 

right to remove employees from 
contract work and the right to 
reduce the management fees paid 
to the university in the event of 
environmental, health and safety 
violations. 

The management proposal will 
include provisions for returning 
fees to scientific programs and for 
the retention of the laboratory's 
staff in the universitywide benefits 
program, according to Dynes. 

"Our technical proposal will 
highlight the strengths of the uni-
versity and what I believe to be 
our unparalleled capacity to pro-
duce scientific achievements at the 
Berkeley lab," Dynes said. 

At the Board of Regents meet-
ing, state Sen. Denise Ducheny 
(D-San Diego) also said she, along 
with the New Mexico state legisla-
rure, supported a university bid for 
the manarement of all three labs, 
including the Berkeley facility. 

"I do believe it is important for 
us, particularly with respect to 
Berkeley and Livermore, that we 
maintain the group of contracts

I BRIEFLY 
A.S. Council, GSA call for 

new co-op oversight system 
The University Centers Advisory Board and 

co-op members would lose their spots on the 
campus' co-op oversight committee under a 
preliminary plan proposed by Associated 
Students and the Graduate Student 
Association, according to University Centers 
Director Gary Ratcliff. 

Explaining the proposal offered during the 
five-party talks designed to extend the student 
co-op leases - which the university threatened 
to terminate in November - Ratcliff asked 
UCAB members at their Jan. 25 meeting for 
input and opinions on the board's role under 
the plan, which UCAB Chair Jessica Kart could 
take back to negotiations. 

If approved, the plan would establish a body 
composed of student govemment representa-
tives to oversee the co-ops, according to 
Ratcliff. The body would be responsible for a 
review ev,ery two years to certify that the co-ops 
represent the best "interest of the students:' In 
addition, it would serve as a forum for resolving 
disputes with administrators or University 
Centers, he said. 

A conflict-of~nterest provision in the over-
sight committee's draft charter would prohibit 
co-op members from serving as representa-
tives. 

However, Ratcliff asked UCAB members to 
delay their comments on the proposal until it 
received authorization from campus 
ombudsperson Judith C. Bruner after the 
board's GSA representative, Dana Dahlstrom, 
wamed that the details of the plan might be 
covered by a confidentiality agreement in effect 
for the negotiation process. 

Bruner is moderating the talks between the 
co-ops, the two student govemment associa-
tions, University Centers and campus adminis-
trators. 

After the board approved Ratcliff's sug-
gestion without objection, Staff Association 
representative Yolanda Leyva pointed o.ut 
that his earlier statements would be included 
in the board's min utes, which are open to 
the public. 

By consensus, the board approved a motion 
to expunge the previous discussion of the 
negotiations. However, several members then 
warned that the recorded vote to remove a por-
tion of the minutes might create a mistakenly 
nefarious impression. 

'1ust don't put it in," Student Affirmative 
Action Committee representative Kirsten 
Bowen said to secretary Dina Randazzo. 

On a final vote, the board approved replac-
ing the section in the minutes with a statement 
explaining that it would seek advice from 
Bruner before discussing possible co-op over-

Re~rt: More oversight 
neededforunwersHylend~ 

Even as more and more universities enter 
the loan business by lending money to gradu-
ate and professional students, a new report 
from the Govemment Accountability Office has 
found that the govemment does not have 
enough information to ensure that they are not 
defrauding taxpayers. 

Though universities lent only $1. 5 billion of 
the more than $84 billion in total government-
backed student loans distributed in 2004, they 
are rapidly entering the loan business and 
expanding their borrowing operations. Much of 
the growth has occurred among private non-
profit universities, who usually sell their debt 
notes to other companies shortly after making 
the loans as a way to raise revenue, the GAO 
stated. 

To correct for a dearth of regulations in the 
emerging industry, the report recommended 
that the Education Department's Office of 
Student Aid enact new rules requ iring colleges 
to submit regular audits and financial state-
ments. 

Superintendent warns of 
state underfunding school 

In his second annual State of Education 
address, California state Superintendent of 
Public Instruction Jack O'Connell offered his 
backing for creating lower thresholds to pass 
school parcel taxes. 

The time has come "to let the voters choose 
to stop starving our schools: he said, urging the 
state to lower its current two-third voter-
approval level needed to pass taxes that can 
pay for ongoing school operations to 55 per-
cent. 

O'Connell also criticized Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger for failing to include the full 
public school funding guaranteed by 
Proposition 98. 

"We have created world-class expectations 
for our students and schools in California, but 
we simply aren't funding our schools at the 
level they need to produce world-class 
results: he said. 'California is not investing in 
its future:' 

Schwarzenegger, on multiple occasions, has 
dismissed calls for higher taxes, calling on leg-
islators to reduce unnecessary spending 
instead.

I A.S. COUNCIL AT A GLANCE 
A_S_ Meeting '18 - Jan. 26, 2005 

Items of Immediate 
Consideration 
Item B 

The council approved a line-item budget 
for the Winterfest 2005 concert, totaling 
almost $60,000. Included in the budget is 
more than $30,000 to hire performers Social 
Distortion, KRS-One and others. 

Reports 
Presidential Chief of Staff Jared Feldman 

Feldman reported that the Price Center 
Building Advisory Committee is grossly 
over budget. Therefore, the committee will 
discuss the development plans that will be 
phased out or cut completely from the 
expansion. According to Feldman, current 
suggestions include eliminating a stage and 
dressing room planned for the performance 
area, among others. 

Council Caucus 
The council discussed the current nego-

tiations between the university and the sru-
dent co-ops. According to President Jenn 
Pae, she and Thurgood Marshall Junior 
Senator Kate Pillon met with a lawyer to 
discuss representing Associated Srudents in 
the discussions. Pae and PiJlon both said 
that it was not necessary for a lawyer to rep-
resent the council. In an unofficial vote, only 
four of the 14 senators present supported 
allocating money to pay for legal represen-

ration. 
Additionally, Pilion said she was frustrat-

ed with the administration's attempt to rele-
gate the role of the council to a mere advi-
sory position. According to Pill on, she and 
Pae have instead lobbied for the A.S. 
Council to receive the ability to rule on 
whether the co-ops are representing the stu-
dents' best interests. 

Old Business 
ItemB 

The council approved the reallocation of 
57,000 from the general unallocated fund 
into A.S. Programming to help pay for the 
Sun God festival. 

New Business 
ItemD 

Revelle College Senior Senator Ted 
McCombs proposed a resolution opposing a 
bill inrroduced in the state Senate that 
requests the UC Board of Regents to imple-
ment a set of academic freedom guidelines 
to ensure a lack of bias in the classroom. 
According to McCombs, the bill would 
undennine the learning environment.

Tour: Future welfare of university, 
state linked together, Dynes says 

continued from page , 
organizer Jessica Lopez, referring to the 
compact. "He can, with the same wave of a 
pen, bring the contract dispute that we have 
to an end." 

Dynes personally spoke at the vigil after 
the alumni gathering, pledging to do his 
best to offer future raises to the workers, 
Lopez said. 

At the town hall meeting, UCSD 
researcher and President of the University 
Professional and Technical Employees 
Local 9 Carolan Buckmaster also ques-
tioned Dynes about a third year offlat wages 
for university staff. 

"No one can defend the tough times the 
state of California has gone through, but I 
am pleased that the governor has offered 
this compact so we can have raises for our 

staff," Dynes said, pointing out that 
Schwarzenegger's proposed budget 
promised to provide a 1.5-percent raise. 

Reflecting on the year he spent touring 
the state and the university, Dynes said he 
realized the importance of his instirution in 
the state. 

"The thing that I came to be aware of is 
that we - you and I - have a hand in this 
incredible legacy," he said. "Our job is to 
keep the University of California at the top 
of its game, because we have a responsibili-
ty to our state and our society .... It's only 
that way that California can continue to be 
the only place in the world where we want 
to live."

THURSDAY, JANUARY 27.2005 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

UC head rules out privatization 
As part of his visit to thr UC C/P1I-

pus, UC President and ftmner UCSD 
ChalluUor Robert C. Dynes sat iJqum 
with tbe Guardian editur1a/ board for a 
quertion-alld-answtr stSsiun about thi 
top ;mus facing the rmivn-rity. The fol-
luwing is (/ pa7Tiai campikltiull of Dynts' 
rmla7'lis: 

Gullrdian: How do you feel 
about increasing reliance on private 
funds and what is the effect of that 
on the university'S mission? 

Dynes: There is some rumbling 
about privatizing the university -
you've probably heard some of that 
n mbling, That's code for saying, 
"How do we afford, as a public 
instirution, to do what we do?" The 
state of Cali fornia has reduced the 
number of money that supports the 
UC from 12 percent of its budget 
to 7 or 8 percent of its budget over 
the past 20 years. That's why you're 
paying more fees. The state has 
walked away from its responsibili-
ties and it's reaching a limit, 
because you can't pay much more 
in the way of fees . 

We've got to find other ways to 
find money. Now, one of the obvious 
ways is private philanthropy - peo-
ple donating to the university. Right 
now, the university receives just a lit-
tle over $1 billion a year from private 
sources. You would say, "Holy cow, 
that's a lot of money!" And you're 
right; I can't even imagine what a bil-
lion dollars would look like if sitting 
on a table. That having been said, 
the university receives from the state 
almost $3 billion, so that one billion 
is still pretty small. 

G: Do you see a specific threshold 
at which a public university becomes 
a priva te tmiversity - a point beyond 
which you're not willing to go? 

D: I'm not willing to become a 
private university, in part because of 
my own belief in public educ:ltion . ... 

Let's sta rt off philosophically, 

because I grew up in a public system. 
I was educated in a public system. I 

- worked my way through college with 
jobs. 1 managed to do it - my par-
ents couldn't help me. If it weren't for 
the public system, I would not be 
here today, and I know that. I believe 
that the United States has the best 
public systems in the wo~ld and that 
the University of California is the 
best public system we have. 

Despite the fact that the fees have 
gone up, you can sti ll somehow take 
some debt that isn't going to kill you 
and graduate and pay it back. It 
shouldn't be that way, but it is. 

So now, let me give you some 
cold, hard facts . The state of 
California gives us $3 billion a year. 
It's $9,000 to $10,000 per srudent, 
that's what the state of California 
gives us. Three billion dollars a 
year pays for some of the faculty 
salaries, staff salaries and rooms. 
But nor all of it, by any means. We 
raise a lot of money to pay for the 
stuff to teach you guys . ... 

If we kissed the state goodbye 
tomorrow - "I can't deal going up 
to Sacramento to deal with the 
Legislarure, because they drive me 
crazy" - we would need an 
endowment of $60 billion dollars 
to do that. That's an endowment 
that's bigger than Harvard's .... 

So philosophically, I don't want 
to go there, and practically, T don't 
see where that $60 billion is going 
to come from - that's on the order 
of an entire year's budget for the 
state of California. 

G: Do you know why UCSD is 
lagging behind other campuses in 
alumni donations? 

D: I think the real truth is that 
in a period in the '70s and '80s, sru-
dents were sort of abused at 
UCSD, so they don't have great 
memories of their time .... r mean, 
they weren't taken seriously. r think 

ON THE WEB

hltp:/ IWWW.uadguon:JIon.Ofg. 

that we kind of [brushed them 
aside], that we didn't have much in 
the way of residences .... And when 
people don't care, it shows. There 
is about a decade and a half where 
students felt like, "Alright, you're 
here. Now get out of here." 

Now, I think all of that has 
changed. I can tell you one person 
that cares about srudents: That's 
me. So there is this one and a half 
decades out of our short life where 
we're trying to find these alumni 
and say, "Please, please, please give 
us a second chance." 

G: A srudy released last year 
compared the performance of Preuss 
School with other applicants who 
were not accepted. and found no sta-
tistical di fference. Why do you feel 
that this specific outreach program 
deserves more protection against 
cuts than other outreach programs? 

D: You have to first understand 
that I was instrumental in the 
Preuss School, so I have a certain 
fatherly feeling. 1 almost lost my 
neck on the Preuss School. You're 
roo young to understand this, out I 
almost lost my job for the Preuss 
School, so I have a certain owner-
ship in the Preuss School, an emo-
tional attachment to it. 

I'm willing to put academic 
preparation money - outreach 
money - into anything that proves 
successful. Not goofy ideas, but any-
thing that acrually achieves success. 

And what is success? In my view, 
success is preparing young people 
so they can acrually compete by the 
11 th grade and will be eligible for

pynes provides key 
leadership and vision 

Despite daunting bud-get times ahead, the University of 
California has an invaluable 
resource on its side: 
President Robert C. Dynes. 
At a Jan . 24 campus appear-
ance, Dynes demonstrated 
his uplifting passion and 
vision, which are surely nec-
essary to guide the unIversi-
ty through these challenges. 

Though he has faced 
criticism - these pages 
included - for his unilat-
eral negotiations on a bud-
get compact with Gov. 
Arnold Schwarzenegger, 
Dynes' year-long, universi-
tywide tour has exhibited 
his desire for broad input, 
including new advisory 
committees formed under 
his administration. His 
insistence on placin~ 
"qua lity over quantity' 
bodes well for continuing 
the legacy of excell ence 
that has defined this insti-
tution . In an interview, 
Dynes sta ted his cominit-

ment to using the universi-
ty's meager state funding to 
support target personnel, 
induding competitive 
wages for chancellors and 
merit-based promotions 
for staff and faculty. 

In this time of need, it is 
important that the universi-
ty possess a long-term 
model to chart its course 
into the future . However, it 
is imperative for Dynes to 
realize the limitations of his 
own idealism and hopeful-
ness and acknowledge the 
sensitivity of the assump-
tions in his plans. Whether 
it is the built-in inflation 
estimates in the compact or 
assumptions about the pro-
fessional needs of the state's 
eco'nomy 20 years down the 
road , these assumptions 
may derail even the best-
laid strategies. 

Though challenges 
remain, Dynes' current 
administration certainly 
provides a basis for cautious 
optimism. 

Connerly's campaigning 
tarnishes legacy 

Ward Connedy leaves the UC Board of Regents this year 
one of the most controver-
sial figures in the University 
of California's history -
and righ tfully so. Over his 
12-year term, the regen , 
appointed by Gov. Pete 
Wilson , has established 
himself as an unlikely but 
unfaltering critic of affirma-
tive action. His successful 
drives to end all semblance 
of racial preference and cat-
egorization have precluded 
anything but scorn from 
progressives. 

Most unfortunate, how-
ever, was Connedy's 
propensity to use the politi-
cal prominence conferred 
by his position to promote 
his polItical agenda outside 
the university and even out-
side the state. Cannerly's 
extracurricular involvement 
in sta tewide anti-affirmative 
action ampaigns like 
Prorositions 209 and 54, as 
wei as his continued lobby-

ing for similar legislation in 
other states su~sest an inap-
propriate pobocal reading 
of fiis role as a member of 
the. university's governing 
body. 

Connedy was not entire-
ly the boogeyman his critics 
have made him out to be, as 
recent accounts by UC 
Students Association 
President J ennjfer Lilla and 
Student Regent-designate 
Adam Rosenthal have indi-
cated. But sadly, his reckless 
crusade against contempo-
rary perceptions of race tar-
nishes an otherwise praise-
worthy lepacy marKed by 
the regents endorsement of 
domestic partnershi p 
rights, support for outreach 
programs and opposition to 
student fee increases. 

Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger would be 
wise to consider the unfor-
tunate ramifications of 
dragging politics into a 
IJ.ubl!c trust when selecting 
Connerly's successor.

Critics overlook Preuss 
School's strong achievements 

By BRYAN TSAO 
Opinion Editor 

The recent calls for Preuss School's funding to be 
distributed to other outreach programs are surprising 
and demonstrate a lack of understanding of the bene-
fits that the school brings to not only the students who 
attend it, but to California's much maligned K-12 edu-
cation system. Many critics believe that the school 
doesn't deserve the disproportionate funding it 
receives, arguing that the money spent on educating a 
relatively small number of students could be more 
effectively spent on other fonns of outreach, such as 
the Early Academic Outreach Program. 

Unfortunately, this argument completely ignores 
a fundamental aspect of Preuss School's mission: 
Besides enrolling low-income, non-native-English-
speaking children whose parents never received a col-
lege degree (generally the students least likely to go 
to college) and sending them off to prestigious uni-
versities, the school also field -tests educational prac-
tices with hope to improve K-12 education in 
California. Policies that the school is testing out 
i ncl utle more instructional days, smaller class sizes 
and a structured curriculum to support low-income 
students. Many of the school's students are also 
underrepresented minorities, meaning the state can 
apply any results about what does and does not work 
to deal with the root cause of the university'S low 
minority enrollment. No, it's not Ward Connerly, 
Proposition 209, insufficient outreach funding or the 
vast right-wing conspiracy - it's because our prima-
ry and secondary schools do a poor job of educating 
low-income and minority students. On the other 
hand, EAOP and other programs that critics argue 
should receive Preuss' funds focus more on educating 
low-income high school students about how to 
become eligible for college. While that is certainly a 
very important task and an effective short-term 

means of improving minority and low-income enroll-
ment rates, it's more of a Band-Aid than a structural 
improvement. From that perspective, Preuss School 
is a much better investtnent in the long term. 

According to a study sponsored by the Center for 
Research on Educational Equity, Assessment and 
Teaching Excellence, Preuss School isn't exactly fail -
ing at its other job. Preuss students completed more 
UC A-G . eligibility requirements by grade II than 
the students rejected by the school, and every student 
completed the requirements by graduation, probably 
the result of the added instructional time that the 
school's extra funding helps cover. Moreover, the idea 
that Preuss students perform no better than rejected 
applicants is patendy false. The study clearly reports 
that Preuss students scored "significantly higher" on 
the history section of the California Standards Test. 
Instead of cherry picking the test results that show 
that rejected applicants perform as well as Preuss stu-
dents to justify taking away the school's funding, per-
haps it would be more constructive to allow the 
school to continue to function and determine why its 
history te:tching meth.ods are so effective and apply 
those lessons to its entire curriculum. After all , that is 
th'e sort of thing the school was established to deter-
mine and disseminate to other schools. 

Those results don't even consider the school's 
impressive showing when compared to other San 
Diego and California high schools in spite of its dis-
advantaged students. According to the report, the 
school scored the highest Academic Performance 
Indicator scores in San Diego County among schools 
composed of at least 80 percent students eligible for 
federal meal assistance, as well as in the top 10 of all 
San Diego schools. Ninety-eight percent of Preuss 
students also took the SAT I in 2002, compared to 37 
percent of California high school students in general

T he sky was clear, the air crisp. Washington, D.C., was secure, in the post-Sept. 
11 sense: grim-looking snipers on 
rooftops, cops on every corner, 
packs of protesters clamoring in the 
distance . 

It was a celebration. 
On Inaugura tion Day last week, 

President Bush seemed to gleam 
with fa ith that everything in his sec-
ond term would go as smoothly for 
him as the $40 million ceremony 
tha t kicked it off. You could see in 
his eyes the confidence - or cocki-
ness - that his critics love to hate 
and his admirers love to rely upon. 

That gloat of self-importance, 
the poker face of the Bush presi-
dency, seeped into all the festivities 
onJan. 20, but it found a manifesto 
in the speech Bush gave to formal-
ly begin his second term. 

It was irony typical of Bush 
administration functions : The 
president spoke on the importance 
of "liberty" at home and abroad, 
asserting the primacy of U.S. inter-

and 49 percent of San Diego 
County. On average, the students 
scored 984 compared to the 
California average of 1012 and the 
San Diego County average of 1003 
- although lower than average, it is 
impressive considering the Statistic 
includes all Preuss students com-
pared to only the top 37 percent of 
Californian students. The top half 
of Preuss students averaged 11 22 . 

Asserting that Preuss doesn 't 
improve students' college admis-
sions rates is also problematic 
because it doesn't adjust for the 
kind of schools that Preuss students 
applied to. The study states that 
four-year colleges accepted Preuss 
students and students whom Preuss 
rejected at roughly the same rate 
(90 percent). What we don't know 
about the rejected students is which 
colleges they applied to or will 
imend. [n the relatively short histo-
ry of the school , alumni have 
already matriculated to such highly 
selective universities as Stanford, 
Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology, Dartmouth and the 
University of California. While it's 
imposs ible to know for certain 
without further research, it's plausi-
ble that Preuss students apply to, 
on average, more highly selective 
universities, making their 90 per-
cent acceptance rate potentially 
much more impressive. 

The study in question even con-
cludes with, "The students of the 
Preuss School have already made 
some impressive strides," and sees 
Preuss as a "school that has high 
average achievement in spite of the 
relative socioeconomic disadvan-
tage of its studem population," 
making an argument for cutting 
Preuss' funding even more unten-
able. The study itself cautions read-
ers from jumping to conclusions 
based on its re.latively limited data 
and states that C.R.E.A.T.E. hopes 
to gather additional data.in the

it would be fooHsh to pull the plug

ests in shaping its foreign policy 
and warning all those who might 
stand in its way. 

In a l6-minute address, Bush 
mentioned "freedom" 27 times. He 
did not mention Iraq by name. 

Instead, he opted to stick to his 
stubborn idealism - that tri -
umphant American trait that Bush 
has contorted into an excuse for 
war, turning something for which 
we were once respected , even 
loved, into an Orwellian 
euphemism for arrogance and self-
ishness. On that cold Washington 
day, Bush's faith in his own actions 
was as unrelenting as ever. 

The American people's fa ith, 
however, was not. Inaugural festiv-
ities distracted from the fact that 
Bush's approva l rating, hovering 
around 50 percent, is one of the 
lowest ever for the beginning of a 
second term. It's a sign that finally 
- with the United States broke, 
divided and at war - people may 
be considering the president 'S role 
in all this misery. 

Or it might be a sign of the pub-
lic 's realization that the arrogant 
president's second four-year agenda 
is even more unpalatable than his 
first. 

Having sufficiently pillaged 
America's foreign policy in his first 
term, Bush is looking to create his 

legacy through a domestic agenda 
aimed at demolishing the safety 
nets of the New Deal and other 
social programs while casting a veil 
of conservative Christian values 
over the country. 

His plan to pr.ivatize Social 
Security, which he claims is in crisis, 
is by far the most disrurbing domes-
tic plot hatched by the administra-
tion so far. Citing false numbers 
(generated by the propaganda 
machine your tax dollars pay for), 
Bush claims that Social Security will 
be bankrupt by 2018. His solution 
for this is privatization of the sys-
tem, with the formation of individ-
ual accounts that would allow users 
to invest in the stock market. 

The problem with Bush's solution 
is that a real problem with Social 
Security doesn't exist. Economists 
predict that Social Security may, in 
2052, have to reduce payments to 80 
percent of what they are now. But 
that may not happen, and even if it 
did, solving such a problem would 
not be a huge expense. 

Privatizing the nation 's largest 
and most successful social program, 
on the other hand, would be a titan-
ic cost. It would also remove from 
existence the only definite source of 
income for many elderly Americans. 
Even if the stock market continued 
to grow, which it very well may not, 

Bush's plan would still net a loss of 
benefits for most Amcricans com-
pared to the current system. 

B4Sh's plan to privatize Social 
Security is a plan to run it into the 
ground. He's already done that with 
the federal budget, running a defic it 
of around $413 billion to pay for 
the war he started and the tax cuts 
for the wealthy he wants to make 
permanent. Even facing a weak dol-
lar and an economy that's at best 
keeping its head above water, Bush 

keep~ that stubborn optimism. 
Maybe it's because he doe n't 

ImI1W things are so bad. This, after 
all , is the president who said he did-
n't want to hear bad news about 
Iraq, who surrounds himself only 
with people who agree with him, 
who proudly asserts that he doesn't 
read the newspapers. 

Is it possible he 's never heard of 
the 45 million Americans without 
health care? Or the actual financial 
crisis that troubles Medicare and 
Medicaid? These programs, which 
provide medical care and prescrip-
tion drug coverage to the poor and 
elderly, face a serious solvency 
problem, but that doesn't bother 
Bush. He's content to let them die. 

Poor people, apparently, have 
no place in the "ownership society." 

Neither, of course, do gays who 
wish to be married, or women who 

~ llVE 

wish to have an abortion . Bu h 
plans to keep up efforts toward a 
constitutional ban on gay marriage, 
whi le openly praising antI-abortion 
activists who clamor for Supreme 
Court appointments to overturn 
Roe v. Wade. 

Liberty? Freedom? Only if you 
fall neatly into Bush's value systems 
OT can make a significant financial 
contribution. 

The good news is that Bu h's 
radical second-term agenda is mect-
ing serious resistance, even from 
within hi s own party. Moderate 
Republicans in Congress are already 
squirming at Bush's plans for ocial 
Security. Having been alerted to the 
administration's tendency to pro,~de 
misinformation, media ' outlets 
everywhere are blaring the truth: 
Social Security is not in crisis, but 
the nations finances are. 

Strident optimism was a fine 
face to wear on Inauguration Day, 
but Bush will soon find that it does-
n't suit all occasions. As war casual-
ties and costs rise, and resistance to 
the Bush administration's plan to 
turn America back into the Wild 
West grows, his expression may 
change to reflect reality.

Ducheny said. "I think as people 
have moved into the bidding 
process, they've realized ... the 
work the university has done [in 
this lab), the magnitude of it and 
the importance of that relationship 
with the university." 

The Energy Department began 
the bidding process for the labs 
after a series of safety and security 
violations in recent years. In the 
summer of 2004, a

join Nuclear Watch of New 
Mexico in making a competitive 
bid for the Los Alamos lab. 

"In submitting a proposal, we 
seek , to influence the bidding 
process and ultimately. the Los 
Alamos lab contract as well, irre-
spective of whether we are chosen 
to manage the Los Alamos lab,"

Eastwood, 
performance 

Swank deliver knockout 
in modern 'Rocky' story 

By ANIA DYLEWSKA 
Senior Staff Writer 

With the superb "Mystic River, Â· it seemed that Clint Eastwood had 
Film 

REVIEW 
reached the apex of his directing career. The film not only garnered 
tremendous performances, (Sean Penn and Tim Robbins won Oscars 
for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor, respectively), but dealt gen-
uinely with relationships between family and friends handling loss, 
suspicion, loyalty and betrayal. 

In "Million Doliar Baby,Â· Eastwood again inspires strong perfor-
mances and manages to delve into a similarly complex set of rela-
tionships, th is time between an aging coach, his old friend and a 
young, determined hopeful. 

Frankie Dunn (Eastwood) is a professional boxing trainer who 
owns the Hit Pit, a shabby boxing gym. He is an expert at teaching 
aspiring boxers all the skills they need to become great. However, 
Frankie's need to shelter his trainees, and himself, eventually drives 
them away because he Is reluctant to put them into championship 
fights. Eastwood plays Frankie as a downcast man who has been to 
mass almost every day for 23 years in search of redemption, but who 
is still unable to atone for the mistakes he made in the past. One 
error has resulted in an estranged relationship with his daughter, 
which fuels an unnecessary subplot in the film. Eastwood adds grav-
ity to Frankie by tapping into layers of sadness and guilt that appear 
to be the reasons behind his conservatism and cynicism. 

Frankie only has one lifelong friend, Eddie "Scrap Iron" Dupris 
(Morgan Freeman), a one-eyed, has-been champion and caretaker 
of the gym. Freeman again revitalizes his finely tuned trademark-
noble role. Despite their constant humorous parade of well-
rehearsed insults, Frankie and Scrap have an unusually loving bond 
based on understanding and, from Frankie's perspective, guilt over 
Scrap's injury. 

The movie receives an oomph of energy when 31 -year-old 
Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) forcefully enters Frankie's gloomy 
world and asks him to train her. Frankie immediately refuses and tells 
her that she is too old and that he does not train ' girls ." However, 
Maggie, who grew up dirt-poor and has nothing without boxing , is 
unwill ing to take 'no ' for an answer. Instead, she spends every 
minute between w"itrp. :lsing shifts practicing her punches at the gym, 
and is encouraged by Scrap, who recognizes her talent, passion and 
ambition. 

Swank easily morphs into Maggie both physically and emotional-

Iy. After three months of training, the actress' strong, muscular 
physique looks pr~isely like the body o.f an agile and enduri~g 
athlete. Swank ignites Maggie With the vigor of a dogged rookie 
and endows her with the sheer determination, unshakable 
willpower and unobstructed focus that are simply compelling. 

In an intense scene at the gym on the day that Maggie turns 
32, Maggie's vulnerability astonishes Frankie . Swank skillfully 
allows Maggie's desperation to .gently ~urface from und~r her 
solid resolve which moves Frankie to tram her. Soon Frankie arms 
Maggie with 'a powerful knockout punch that helps her swing her 
way through se~eral tough opponents. At this p~int, the ~tory 
seems like a typical struggle of an underdog who fights against 
all odds to become a champion. Yet despite the "Rocky"-like 
set-up, the film takes an unexpected twist, a!'ld it ~omes 
clear that the feature is about much more than just bOXing. 

Cinematographer Tom Stem surrounds the action with omi-
nous shadows, while the director arms characters with secrets 
that are never fully exposed. The characters shift in and out of 
light, but they mostly reside in between, in a gritty, gray under-
world. There are no easy truths in this place. Instead, the 
thought-provoking storytelling explores the blurry regions 
between good and evil, morality and immorality, sin and 
redemption, and God and death. 

In the film, a borderline father-daughter relation-
ship develops between Frankie and Maggie. 
Eastwood and Swank share a subtle connection that 
seerns honest, profound and loving, but not exces-
sively sweet. Once the film takes a darker turn, 
Maggie and Frankie face their deepest fears as 
they struggle to retain their bond, and at the sa~e 
time courageously get through a final battle. ThiS 
battle progresses to a haunting and affecting end-
ing that gracefully plays at the heartstrings.

THE NO-COST

CABARET SHOWS WORD-OF-MOUTH 
CHANNEL STUDENT TALENT 

By OAKLEY ANDE.SEN-MOORE 
Staff Writer 

Other than the fantastic graduate and undergraduate shows pro-duced by the UCSD theater and dance department, there is another remarkable, albeit lesser known, element of UCSD's 
perfonning arts greamess: the "cabaret." Besides giving students the 
opportunity to create or perform whatever their unbridled imagina-
tions and efforts can produce, the "cabaret" also gives broke college 
students a chance to see fresh, collaborative works for free. 

The theater and dance department parcels out performance 
spaces and specific dates during each week of the quarter to students 
who want to produce shows. Those students seek out a cast and 

crew, rehear.;e and then, mostly through word of mouth, 
draw in audiences to see their finished products. 

This weekend, the small thrust stage in Galbraith 
Theater will house Tennessee WIlliams' "The Notebook of 
Trigorin," directed by Earl Warren College senior Michelle 
Trachtenberg. In this widely overlooked work, WIlliams 
reworks Anton Chechkov's "The Seagull" into an illurninat-
ing play about unrequited love, berrayal and other human 
relations, using his poetics to shift the perspectives on the 
characters and reveal what Chechkov never did. 

"To enjoy 'Notebook,' you can never have seen 
[Chechlc.ovs) play before and sti ll know the characters and 
the plot," Trachtenberg said. ur mean, who hasn't experi-
enced a broken heart?" 

Trachtenhcrg came across this play at Barnes and Noble 
and then convinced a cast and crew of some 16 people [0 
work on it with her. 

Abandoning the traditional practice of audition ing, 
Trachtenberg approached each person independently for 
their particular role. 

"It was a brave choice," said Thurgood Marshall College 
junior Allison Dana, who plays the officious Arkadina. "She placed

The GalDe 
The Documentary 

Interscope 

To call the Game's major label debut, Tilt Docume11lary, highly 
anticipated would be an 
understatement. With a 
move out of the 50 Cent 
playbook, Game teamed 
with Dr. Ore and with 
many other rop producers 
to create an album with 
unprecedented pre-release 
hype. 

Game intends to bring 
the West Coast back with 
this CD, and it starts off 
strong with the Dre- and 
SCOtt Storch-produced 
"Westside Story." The 
identifiably Kanye track 

"Dreams" follows, and 50's 
appearance on "Hate it or 
Love It" makes it one of the 
more catchy, radio-bound 
tracks. The album stays 
strong through the middle 
with "Higher," "Put You on 
the Game" and "Start From 
Scratch." The CD closes 
on a more introspective 
note, with the last song a 
reflection on his new role as 
a father. 

The DOCllmmtary was 
done very carefully by the 
notorious perfectionist 
Dr. Dre, but the Game has 
a long way ro go. Rapping 
for under two years, he 
has yet ro find his own 
style, takes shots at rap's 
punching bag, Ja Rule , 
and name-drops much 
more than is acceptable in 
rap. 

Game claims that this 
album is "Ready to Die, 
Reasonable Doubt and 
Doggystyle in one." While 
that is certainly far from 
the truth, this is an enjoy-
able listen with few poor 
tracks and some of the 
best production possible 
today.

Is it really possible to function in a world without clear blue skies, 
a beautiful ocean and a 
bright warm sun? For us 
San Diegans, such a world 
is unthinkable. We view 
countries with snow as safe 
havens from the Bush 
administration, not as hip, 
booming cultural centers. 

Those of you who 
know your music are shak-
ing your head. You're 
probably listing to count-
less musical acts from 

Canada that silence my 
brand of San Diegan arro-
gance. Well, it's time to 
add another band from up 
north to that list. 

Death from Above 
1979 are more of a duo 
than a band. Their combi-
nation of loud, distorted 
bass guitar and pounding 
drums will remind some of 
Lightning Bolt, but the 
comparisons are only 
superficial. Death From 
Above 1979 is, like it or 
not, a hard rock band. 
Sure, there are sparks of 
noise here and there, but 
even the pop-radio-friend-
ly Beatles had "noise" 
Spurts. You're a Woman, I'm 
a Machim reminds how 
cool riff-heavy rock is. The 
album overflows with 
catchy riffs and sing-along 
choruses, making it the 
perfect gift for the M1V-
worshipping generation. 
Moreover, this album 
forces us to rethink our 
cultural position in the 
world, as many of our con-
tributions are more of an 
embarrassment than 
achievement.

Cabaret: Giving aspiring 
UCSD producers a shot 

conrinued from page 7 
a lot of faith in me, so 
wanted to step up to it." 

Eleanor Roosevelt 
College senior Brian 
Swarberg, who plays 
Trigorin, said Trachtenberg 
approached him enthusiasti-
cally. 

"Her excitement and 
drive and constant proposi-
tioning got me wanting to 
do it," he said. The play fea-
tures a very talented cast, 
some recognizable from 
previous department shows 
and some who are as yet 
unrecognized, such as 
Warren senior Dylan 
Seaton, whose role of 
Constantine will be his first 
lead in a play. 

"Michelle is awesome," 
Seaton said. "She's made me 
a lot better actor just in the 
course of a few weeks." 

Amid encouragements 
like "Slap me some skin 
'cause that was the best!" 
and "Give me those lungs, 
honeybuns," Trachtenberg's 
rehearsal process is infused 
with the feeling that every-
one is being encouraged to 
achieve their best under the 
dIrector's charismatic and 
innovative eye. ]n the midst 
of rehearsing a scene, 
-::-rachtenberg exclaims, 
"That was such a brilliant 

moment - she started and 
suddenly all of you leaned 
in. It was fucking brilliant! 
Oh my god, my heart'" 

Tender moments like 
these are not uncommOll. 
There is a noticeable com-
munity relationship in the 
process between these peers, 
and this collaborative aspect 
must have played a large fac-
tor in what has led to some 
very touching achievements 
during the play. 

Trachtenbergs "director's 
note" reads, "I love emotion, 
anything that gets my blood 
bubbling will command my 
attention. Tennessee 
Williams does this for me 
tenfold." Indeed, the play is 
full of emotional nettles that 
prick at you amid Williams' 
beautiful language. T he 
young and disconsolate char-
acter, Masha, says, "When 
there's nothing else to say, 
people always say 'yomh, 
youth,'" to which Trigorin 
responds wistfully, "How 
tortured you are by it. And by 
love, unrequited . Well. 
Youth, love, they're worth 
the price." The price of this 
performance - merely two 
hours of your time - is also 
worth it. "The Notebook of 
Trigorin" shows this week-
end only, at 8 p.m. onJan. 28 
and Jan. 29 in Galbraith 157.

Dynes: Governor pledged to honor compact 
conrinued from page 3 

the Uc. It's a simple measure. Just 
give me those measures and I'll find 
some money to put into it. 

G: You have said that you would 
allocate $12 million to outreach 
programs, no matter how the 
Legislature comes down in the 
budget. Are you willing to sacrifice 
enrollment for outreach? 

D: No, we'll find that money 
elsewhere. We must meet the 
Master Plan. I'm a devotee of the 
Master Plan, so we have to continue 
that growth of 5,000 students. We 
have to find that outreach money, we 
have to find that $12 million else-
where. But no, I won't trade it off. 

G: If the sufficient amount of 
money to rebuild University House 
cannot be raised through private 
funds, is the UC Office of the 
President prepared ro fund it? 

D: I've said "no" so far. That's 
local and they've got to raise that 
money locally. 

My wife and I lived in that house 
for seven years. You would look at it 
and go, "Holy cow, would I love to 
live in that house'" And it was nice. 
On the other hand, it was dangerous. 
I have a photograph of mushrooms 
growing in the bedroom carpet .... 

Something has to be done, 
because nobody should be living in 
that house. ]t is seismically unsafe. 

G: Do you believe we will we 
get enough money? 

D: It will be private money. It 
won't be money that will be 
drained from student resources. 

And ] believe he will, I trust 
him. I've had enough conversations 
that I believe him. But I think he 
appreciates that it's in his best inter-
est. He understands that the 
Universi ty of California is actually 
the salvation of California. He did-
n't know that - I taught him this. 
But he understands it, and I think 
he sees that as the right place to 
invest. 

G: You spoke today about 
"tweaking" the Master Plan. Today, 
California has far more students 
attaining higher education degrees 
and we have far more technology 
jobs that require these degrees than 
when the plan was first written. [s it 
time for the state to go back and 
make revisions to the Master Plan? 

D: No. Let me start off wi th the 
context of the Master Plan. The 
Master Plan is much broader than 
saying that we're the top 12.5 per-
cent of top graduating classes at 
high schools. It talks about research 
and it talks about graduate educa-
tion and graduate degrees .... 

The signal is that the bachelor's 
degree is no longer the terminal 
degree. Every student is thinking 
about what's next: "Am I going to 
go to law school, to medical school, 
get a Ph.D.?" ... 

Inside the Master Plan, we have 
actually been sacrificing the graduate 
programs to continue to meet the 
tidal wave of undergraduates. Now 
that that's going to level off, we have 
to build the graduate schools, so that 
they wi II be better for you. 

companies up and down California, 
almost all of them come from 
California universities .... 

I'll give you a great example: 
Mike Judge. He graduated in 
physics from UCSD and then cre-
ated "Beavis and Butthead," then 
"King of the Hill" and ... so on .. .. 

I don't know what the next 
industries are, but [ hope they 
come out of the UC, because then 
there will be jobs for the arts and 
humanities folks, for the social sci-
entists, for the engineers and for 
the scientists . 

G: With the recent rankings -
I'm sure you've heard that we're 
13 th in the world based on a study 
done in China - how do you think 
UCSD compares to other schools 
in the system and how does the 
University of California, in gener-
al, compare to other private and 
public institutions? 

D: I ain't going to answer that 
first one, because I'd have nine 
campuses killing me. But the sec-
ond part is something that I allud-
ed to in the town hall meeting. The 
University of California, without 
any argument, is the finest univer-
sity in the world. 

Now, people say to me, when I 
say that, "What are you talking 
about, Bob? Harvard? Stanford? 
Princeton?"

G: The governor has come 
under fire for failing to restore 
money to education groups last 
year and for indicating his intent to 
overrurn Proposition 98. Does this 
hold any bearing on your compact 
agreement with him? 

D: He has told me over and 
over again over the past year that 
he would honor the compact ... . 

G: Where does that leave the 
more traditional social science 
majors, who may not be thinking 
about law school but about enter-

F~ncing: Sprowles, Runyan pull off upsets 
- conlinued from page r:2 

foil. Runyan finished 19th in a field 
of 93 in sabre. On the women's 
side, Ambort placed 31 st out of 85 
in epee, and Yianilos placed 90th 
out of 100 in foil. 

In Division I competition, 
Tibbs finished 99th out of 183 in 
epee, Sprowles (who, along with 
Ambort, entered in both competi-
tions) finished 43 rd out of 170 in 
foil, and Runyan and Martin 
placed 93rd and 100th, respective-
ly, out of III in sabre. Ambort 
finished 21 st agai nst 98 other 
women in epee. 

Notable performances include 
Sprowles' 5-3 victory over 
Olympian Dan Kellner and 
Runyan's upset of All -American 
Jason Paul of Ohio State. Paul went 
on to win the tournament, finishing 

first in the Junior Men's Sabre

entire tournament came against 

" The great thing about this 
team is how they all 
pulled together in a 

demanding weekend of 
fencing and travel, " 

- Heidi R,unpn. UCSD fencing 
head coach 

Runyan. 
Based on the NAC results and 

their finish in the top 32, Ambort 

and Runyan have been awarded 
USFA points, which go toward 
determining fencers ' national rank-
ings. 

"Fencing at these national tour-
naments really helps me gain expe-
rience, so I'm less nervous about 
other tournaments," Runyan said. 
"Attending NAC helped prepare 
me for Northwestern the next 
week. Going to big tournaments 
help prepare you for even bigger 
tournaments. " 

On Feb. 5 the Tritons will stay 
home to fence as they host the 
annual San Diego Invitational, 
which will be held at Main Gym. 
The home squad will not only be 
able to cross blades with familiar 
rivals Stanford, Cal Tech and Air 
Force, but it will also get a second 
shot at beating Northwestern . 

Basketball: UCSD capitalizes on turnovers 
continued {rom page 1:2 

The Tri tons were a model of 
consistency, shooting a solid 50 
percent from the fi eld in each half 
while also having a strong game 
from the free-throw line, convert-
ing 79.3 percent of their free 
throws. 

The Antelopes, while shooting 
over 50 percent in the first half, saw 
their accuracy dip to 43.3 percent 
in the second and struggled the 
entire night from three-point 
range. After going l -of-3 from 
long distance in the first half, 
Grand Canyon could not shoot 
itself back into the game, missing 
II of its 14 three-point attempts in 
the second and finishing the game 
with a dismaying 25.3-percent 
shooting performance from behind 
the arc. 

UCSD was also able to take 
advantage of the Antelopes' 17 
turnovers, but limited itself to 
only eight such miscues . UCSD's 
nine steals and 17 assists, com-
bined with its steady shooting 
performance, more than made up 
for Grand Canyon's slightly better 
rebound numbers : the Anteaters 
pulled down 29 boards to the 

, Tritons' 25. 
Four players scored in double 

digits for the Tritons, who have 
gone 3-1 when putting forward 
such a balanced offensive attack. 
Freshman guard Clint Allard led 
the way with 15 points and a 
team-high six assists. Junior guard 
Odioh Odiyeh added 13 points, 
sophomore forward Chris Randall 
had II points on a perfect 4-for-4 
shooting performance from the 
field, and sophomore guard

Robby Peters came off the bench 
to sink three of his six three-point 
attempts en route to his 13-point 
performance. 

, Grand Canyon was led by a 
game-high 24 points from for-
ward A1onz.o. The team had only 
one other player in double digits, 
as reserve Emil Swain contributed 
13 points. 

The Antelopes suffered the 
entire night because of their start-
ing guards' inability to score. 
While Ryan Nelson accounted for 
game highs of eight rebounds and 
eight assists, and Prileau Davis 

added nine points, five assists and 
four rebounds in 40 minutes of 
play, the two combined for eight 
turnovers. 

The Tritons will try to contin-
ue their winning ways in a pair of 
league contests this weekend . 
They will gear up for UCSD 
Spirit Night on Jan. 28 as they 
play host to Sonoma State (9-6 
overall, 6-2 CCAA) , followed by a 
match-up with San Francisco 
Sute (8-7 overall, 5-3 CCAA) on 
Jan . 29. Both games are scheduled 
for a 7:30 p.m. tip-off at RIMAC

Top--ranked nten's fencing goes undefeated in tourney 
Women's team finishes 6-4, led by freshman epeeist Chelsea Ambort 

By EVAN WANG 
Staff Writer 

ot content to stay around 
Southern California and dominate 
the local competition, the UCSD 
fenci ng squad spent the last two 
weekends traveling east to Illinois 
and Kansas to test their "metal" 
against some of the best competi-
tion in the nation. 

On jan. 22 and j an . 23, the 
T ritons, who are currently the top 
squad in the Intercollegiate 
Fencing Cenference of Southern 
California, fl ew to Evanston, 111., 
for the Northwestern Duals to 
compete against the likes of 
Northwestern University, Temple 
University, Michigan State 
Universi ty, j ohns Hopkins 

"The great thing about this 
team is how they all pulled togeth-
er in a demanding weekend of fenc-
ing and travel," head coach Heidi 
Runyan said . "There were 10 
women and 10 men who fenced for 
the Tritons, and every one of them 
contributed victories to the overall 
team's performance." 

University and a handful of other 
schools. Despite the freezing con-
ditions and heavy snowstorms, 
sleep deprivation and the disad-
vantage of the time change, the 
Tritons fenc ed fiercely. The men 
went undefeated in their nine 
head-to-head match ups, led by 
freshman foil Cameron Sprowles, 
who had a very impressive 26-1 
record for the two-day tourna-
ment.

Face off: Junior Masha Merat (right) strikes at her opponent at the Northwestern Duals in Eva:1ston, III., held on Jan. 22

FromJan.14toJan.17, UCSD 
sent a contingent of its strongest 
fencers, including Ambort, 
Sprowles, junior sabre Bret 
Martin, freshman sabre J ason 
Runyan, freshman foil Laurel 
Yianilos and team captain and 
senior epee Timothy Tibbs, to 
Overland Park, Kan., to partici-
pate in the North American Cup, 
which was sponsored by the 
United States Fencing 
Association. They competed 
against the best fencers from all 
across the United States, Canada 
and some even from Europe in 
two categories: Division I (where 
fencers of all ages compete against 
one another) and Juniors (age 19 
and under). 

On the women's side, the hosts, 

much like the weather, were unre-
lentingly harsh and absolutely 
demolished the competition.

currently ranked sixth in the

losing streak with gusto 
UCSD dismantles Grand 

Canyon, 78-64, at RIMAe

In grand style: Freshman guard Andrew Hatch and the Tritons finally snapped a 
dismal five-game losing streak against Grand Canyon on Jan. 25 at RIMAC Arena. 

By JOE TEVELOWnI 
Staff Writer 

After a string of tough losses to 
Californi2 Collegiate Athletic 
Association opponents, the UCSD 
men 's basketball team finally ended 
its misfortunes in a 78-64 victory 
over former CCAA member Grand 
Canyon on Jan. 25 at RIMAC 
Arena. 

T he Tritons (2-6 CCAA, 6-9 
overall) found themselves down 
early to the Antelopes (9-13 over-
all), continuing a recent trend 
where the team has faced first-half 
deficits it is unable to overcome. 

However, o nce the Tritons 
sta rted playing catch-up from the 
nine-point gap midway through 
the first half, they never looked 

back. The team went on a 15-4 
streak to take the lead, and closed 
out the half on an amazing 31-7 
run, placing the team ahead 40-27 
at intermission. 

The Tritons maintained the 
advantage throughout the second 
half, leading by as many as 18 and, 
except for a one-minute period 
after a Prileau Davis steal leading 
to a Noe Alonzo jumper, held a 
comfortable double-digit lead. 

The Tritons' 14-point win was 
the convincing victory this young 
team needed to end its season-
long five-game losing streak, 
defeating Grand Canyon for only 
the fourth time ever in their 12 
meetings. 

See BASKETBALL. Page I I 

against the Tritons was a resound-
ing 24-3, and they didn't lose 
more than six games to any other 
team. Against the rest of the field, 
the Tritons represented them-
selves adequately, going 6-4 over-
all, led by freshman epeeist 
Chelsea Ambort's 22-3 record. 

Perhaps the most exciting head-
to-head matchup for UCSD came 
against Wayne State University. 
After the women's team was nar-
rowly defeated by Wayne State, 13-
14, the men's squad returned the 
favor, squealcing by in a 14-13 vic-
tory. 

In the Juniors competition, 
Sprowles made a very strong show-
ing, placing 38th in a field of 139 in

Tritons fall to D-I Anteaters 
Men, women wrap up regular season 

By MA1THEW GRANT 
Sports Editor 

Closing out the regular season 
against UC Irvine, the Tritons 
men's and women's swimming and 
diving teams came up short in their 
respective meets on Jan. 23, despite 
strong individual showings against 
the Division I Anteaters. While 
managing to stay within striking 
distance thanks to the team's unpar-
alleled depth, UCSD's men lost 
168-127, as UC Irvine captured 
wins in 13 of 16 events. The Triton 
women, coming off only hours of 
rest since defeating University of 
San Diego on Jan. 22, struggled 
and lost, 190-105. 

"I schedule us the toughest 
meets at the end of the season to 
get us ready for NCAAs," head 
coach Scott McGihon said. 

Senior Kurt Boehm led the 
Triton charge, winning both of the 
individual events claimed by the 
Tritons. In the 200-yard freestyle, 
the German transfer christened a 
new meet record by more than two 
full seconds while leaving the sec-
ond- and third-place Anteater fin-
ishers in his wake. The previous 
record of 1 minute, 41.89 seconds, 
set in 2003 by UC Irvine's Phil 
Garcia, didn't hold water against 
Boehm's 1:39.81. Seniors Michael 
Baier and Brady Gosling rounded 
out UCSD's scoring in the event, 
talcing fourth and fifth place, 
respectively. 

In the 200 individual medley, 
Boehm led teammates Baier and 
junior Ben F alcioni to sweep the 
second-to-last event of the meet. 
Touching the wall at 1:50.62, 
Boehm shattered the best UC 
Irvine time in the record books, set 
by Jeff Klatt in 1990. 

But the key for the men's team 
in keeping the meet close was not 
the number of events won but the 
number of races in which Tritons 
took second, third and sometimes 
fourth . UCSD took second place in 

Andrew Mo/Coordion 
The stretch: Senior Brett Going and the Tritons men's swim team stayed close 
to Division I UC Irvine on Jan. 23, but could not capture a win. 
12 of the 13 events it did not win 
and took third in six of those races. 
In swimming, points of descending 
value are awarded to the top-five 
places, thereby malcing non-first 
finishes almost as valuable as victo-
ries at the end of the day. 

The women's team encountered 
difficulty beating the Anteaters to 
the wall, and a lack of depth assured 
that victory would be unattainable 
for the Tritons. The UCSD 
women were swept in four individ-
ual races and struggled to consis-
tently earn lower-value points. 

Senior Rosanna Delurgio and 
sophomore Emily Harlan won the 
l00-yard breaststroke and the 100-
yard freestyle, respectively - two 
of the Tritons' four victories that 
day - but their efforts were 
instantly countered by UC Irvine 
due to a lack o( follow-up. 
Delurgio, for example, earned nine 
points with her first-place race; 
however, because thr four subse-
quent finishers were Anteaters who 
earned four, three, two and one 
points respective to their. finish, the 
Tritons lost the event, 10-9. 

Delurgio's 1:03 .43 victory in the 

100 breast was especially notewor-
thy in light of her brealcing the UC 
Irvine pool record in the event, for-
merly held by UC Berkeley'S 
Staciana Stirts, for her 1 :03.52 set 
in 2000. 

Weighing these results only 
weeks before the Pacific Collegiate 
Swimming Conference 
Championships, it is important to 
note that the Triton women~ team 
came directly off of a dual meet 
against USD onJan. 22, which the 
Tritons won handily, 170-120. 

The Tritons won 12 of 16 
events, including sweeps of both 
the one-meter and three-meter 
diving competitions and wins in 
both the 4OO-yard medley and 400 
freestyle relays. 

"Both teams are going to be in 
the top-three at nationals," 
McGihon said. 

The team and fans alike have 
plenty to look forward to at the 
PCSC Championships held from 
Feb. 16 to Feb. 19 in Long Beach, 
Calif., and again at the NCAA 
Division II Championships from 
March 9 to March 12 in Orlando, 
Fla.
