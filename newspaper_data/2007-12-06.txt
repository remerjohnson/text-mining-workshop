The coordinators of Revelle 
College’s Next Step Program recently 
finalized a partnership with the Grove 
Caffe that will allow the program’s stu-
dent participants to take their profes-
sors out for coffee at the eatery twice 
quarterly.

Created in 2005 by the Revelle 
College Council, Revelle Provost Daniel 
Wulbert and Dean of Student Affairs 
Renee Barnett-Terry, the program was 
designed to encourage upperclassmen 
to develop relationships with faculty 
members outside of lecture halls. The 
yearlong program pairs up to five 
Revelle third- and fourth-year students 
with each involved faculty member 
based on the student’s major.

In addition to promoting ties 
between students and faculty, Revelle  
Senior Representative and Next Step 
Coordinator Aria Jafari said that a 
major goal of Next Step’s partnership 
is to provide publicity for the Grove,

Bomb Threat Empties Campus Medical Complex

By Hadley Mendoza
Senior Staff Writer

In response to last year’s housing strain caused by an 
unexpectedly large freshman class, campus planners are 
working on two new infill housing projects in John Muir 
and Revelle Colleges in the context of previous planning 
studies. The projects, still in the design phase, are part 
of larger neighborhood projects that will be completed 
incrementally over the next 10 to 20 years to provide 
more first- and second-year housing.

Preplanning committees for each of the infill projects 
formed in fall 2006 to brainstorm and discuss concepts 
for the buildings. 

“There was a lot of enthusiasm to complete our living 
environment,” committee member and Muir Resident 
Dean Pat Danylyshyn-Adams said.

Muir’s new housing unit, projected for completion in 
fall 2011, will be approximately 10 stories tall and provide 
about 275 beds. It was designed to integrate the floor plan 
of the college’s apartments into the lounge-centered struc-
ture of its Tioga and Tenaya residence halls.

Originally, there was discussion to place the building 
in the nearby parking lot, but the committee decided to 
keep all housing close to Muir’s central quad. 

“The idea really was to keep it within the Muir com-
munity,” Danylysyhn-Adams said.

In addition to housing, future Muir building projects 
include a renovation of Sierra Summit dining hall and 
adjustments to nearby pathways, in order to accommo-

date the increase in residents. The college will also be add-
ing about 200,000 square feet of space for academic use.

Revelle will be expanding even more, as it stands to 
gain about 700,000 square feet of new academic space 
in addition to about 500 undergraduate beds and an

National Investigators Probe 
Fraternity Hazing Allegations

By Matthew L’Heureux
News Editor

Hundreds of staff and students 
were evacuated from the School of 
Medicine complex on Dec. 5 after a 
suspicious package was discovered 
in the Leichtag Biomedical Research 
Building. While the device was ulti-
mately determined to be a hoax, 
questions regarding campus officials’ 
prior knowledge of the threat persist, 
according to a local union represen-
tative.

All buildings in the School 
of Medicine, along with the 
Skaggs School of Pharmacy and 
Pharmaceutical Sciences Cellular and 
Molecular Medicine East building, 
were evacuated after the package was 
discovered inside Leichtag at 10:26 
a.m., according to FBI Special Agent 
Darrell Foxworth. At approximately 1 
p.m., a campuswide e-mail from Vice 
Chancellor of Business Affairs Steven 
W. Relyea announced the evacuation 
and advised students and staff mem-
bers to avoid the buildings. 

Employees from the FBI, San 
Diego Police Department, UCSD 
Police Department, Bureau of 
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, San 
Diego Fire-Rescue Department and 
U.S. Customs and Border Patrol 
responded to the scene, which was 
then swept for other suspicious 
devices.

“The Metro-Arson Task Force 

took the necessary steps to render 
safe the device,” Foxworth said. “It 
was determined that it was a hoax 
device and not an actual device.”

After determining that the pack-
age was not an actual bomb, officers 
turned the scene over to the evidence 
response team at approximately 5:15 
p.m. The evacuation was contained 
and no one was hurt, Foxworth said.

Skaggs research associate Wenru 
Yu said that she received a phone call 
from a friend at Leichtag telling her to 
evacuate, but continued working until 
the alarm in her building went off.

“No one panicked,” Yu said. “We 
get lots of false alarms.”

After waiting outside their build-

PIKE Brothers Not ‘Smarter 
Than a 5th Grader’

Six UCSD students from the Pi 
Kappa Alpha fraternity competed on 
an episode of the national television 
show “Are You Smarter Than a 5th 
Grader?” that aired Nov. 29 on the 
FOX network.  

Hosted by comedian Jeff 
Foxworthy, the show featured John 
Muir College junior Tyler Van Buren, 
the main contestant who had to rely 
on advice from either a group of 
fifth-graders or his fraternity broth-
ers to answer a series of questions. 
The PIKE brothers ultimately proved 
unsuccessful against the fifth-grad-
ers, but the experience was very 
rewarding, Van Buren said in a press 
release.  

In the episode’s final round, Van 
Buren had to admit he wasn’t smart-
er than a fifth-grader after he was 
asked whether Buddhism originated 
from China or India — he answered 
China.  

UCSD Offers Free Post-
Exposure HIV Test 

The San Diego County Health 
and Human Services Agency is col-
laborating with UCSD’s Antiviral 
Research Center to offer free and 
confidential HIV testing to people 
who may have recently been infected 
with the virus.  

The Early Test Program provides a 
new test method that checks for the 
presence of the HIV virus, which can 
be detected within a week of infec-
tion.  A regular HIV test, in contrast, 
looks for antibodies in the blood, 
which can take three months or lon-

ger to detect.  
“This is especially important 

because newly infected individuals 
have a very high viral load,” said 
Susan Little, an associate profes-
sor of medicine in UCSD’s division 
of infectious diseases, in a press 
release. 

University Gets Grants for 
Math, Science Program
The University of California has 

been awarded nearly $5 million in 
grant funding to improve teacher 
education in math and science, 
university officials announced this 
week. 

UC Irvine and UC Berkeley were 
given two of the 12 grants from the 
National Math and Science Initiative 
to implement programs modeled 
after UTeach, a successful math 
and science teacher preparation 
program at the University of Texas 
at Austin. Grants of up to $2.4 
million were awarded following a 
competition that included submis-
sions from more than 50 universities 
nationwide.

“These grants will allow UC to 
build upon its existing collaborative 
efforts to fill an important need — 
training qualified math and science 
teachers for California classrooms,” 
UC Provost Wyatt R. Hume said in 
a press release. “Addressing this 
teaching shortage is critical to help-
ing keep California’s economy and 
communities strong.”

The NMSI grants will also con-
tribute to UC’s Cal Teach program 
and its commitment to quadrupling 
the number of UC students trained 
annually to be math and science 
teachers from 250 to 1,000 by 2011.

POORLY DRAWN LINES BY REZA FARAZMAND



sages from the source that, coupled 
with low security settings, established 
a thread allowing access to the broth-
ers’ profiles. The informant logged on 
under the alias of “Trent Jacobs” and 
was not part of any network. 

“We never responded to the mes-
sages and have absolutely no idea who 
it is,” Holmes said. 

The evidence presented to Sigma 
Nu Fraternity, Inc. brought officials 
from the organization to UCSD’s cam-
pus last month. The fraternity’s under-
graduate members were individually 
interviewed by officials, and pledging 
has been delayed while the investiga-
tion continues.

“We are working closely with uni-
versity officials to resolve these issues,” 
Braddick said. “The candidate pro-
gram has been suspended until we 
finalize a plan to assist the chapter to 
move forward from this.”

As hazing rumors continue to cir-
culate, charges against other organiza-
tions within the Greek community 
have yet to be substantiated.

“While I cannot speak to any 
specific allegations, as a leader of 
the Greek community I can say that 
hazing is not tolerated by our Greek 
community and that any allegations 
are taken seriously,” said Liz Hill, 

president of UCSD’s Panhellenic 
Council.

However, accusations of fraternity 
hazing have not been presented to the 
Interfraternity Council, according to 
IFC President Ken Schwartz.

“I do not know who made this 
claim nor why they made this claim,” 
Schwartz said. “All chapters have 

been advised to review their Risk 
Management Policies.”

Hazing is a violation of both the 
UCSD Conduct Code and state law. 
Students found guilty of hazing can 
incur monetary fines, academic sus-
pension and possibly prison time. 
Student organizations linked to haz-
ing can lose their affiliation with the 

campus.
“Hazing is a very serious mat-

ter,” Student Organizations Adviser 
Marilyn Russell said. “Hazing is physi-
cally and emotionally damaging and 
can be degrading and humiliating for 
group members. It has no place in any 
organization.” 

If allegations of hazing surface, 
the Center for Student Involvement 
immediately conducts an investi-
gation, evaluating the evidence 
using Student Policies and Judicial 
Affairs to determine if a violation 
of the Student Conduct Code has 
occurred. 

Russell said she was unable to 
provide specific details about any 
hazing allegations on campus at this 
time.

 According to the Sigma Nu Web 
site, the fraternity aims “to develop eth-
ical leaders inspired by the principles 
of love, honor and truth” by overcom-
ing “traditional recruitment practices 
and challenges.” Sigma Nu enforces 
value-based recruitment, described as 
“the fraternity world’s most cutting-
edge recruitment program” to help 
“increase both the quality and quan-
tity” of chapter membership.

Last night’s A.S. Council meet-ing started off smoothly, but hit roadblocks while reviewing 
finance bills and confronting the coun-
cil’s lack of participation in local affairs.

The council arrived at a general 
consensus while amending its election 
rules to make use of single transferable 
votes. The adoption of STV, which 
required years of collaboration with 
TritonLink programmers, will allow 
students to rank 
A.S. candidates 
during elections 
instead of only vot-
ing for their top 
choices.

But consensus 
did not make a 
return appearance. 
A finance bill sponsored by Eleanor 
Roosevelt College Senator Stephanie 
Usry encountered a surprising amount Usry encountered a surprising amount Usry
of council scrutiny.

Usry requested $459 to orchestrate 
“Triton Tuesday” next quarter. She is 
seeking to bolster school spirit campus-
wide by setting up a screen printer on 
Library Walk (on Tuesday, for allitera-
tive effect) and offering to print “Triton 
Pride” logos on students’ otherwise 
spiritless unadorned shirts.

Thurgood Marshall College Senator 
Kyle Samia said that the project should Kyle Samia said that the project should Kyle Samia
be funded by Triton Tide, UCSD’s 
“elite spirit crew,” and debate contin-
ued about purchasing the equipment 
instead of renting it, use of the printer 
by other organizations, the need for 
further research on pricing and a string 
of additional concerns. 

Sixth College Senator John Cressey
expressed his disappointment with the 
council’s skepticism over the proposal. 

“She’s done her research,” he said. “If 
you don’t trust finance committee then 
I’m not very happy about that. Finance 
Committee has done their research.”

After the bill passed, the council 
considered establishing a public events 
manager for A.S. Programming. The 
new position, which would cost about 
$47,000 a year, is designed to ame-
liorate the council’s growing need for 
event planning.

Vice President of External Affairs 
Dorothy Young said the position Dorothy Young said the position Dorothy Young
shouldn’t be created until the council 
secures funding, but the group still 

voted in favor of its 
creation. 

At current fund-
ing levels, the posi-
tion can only be 
supported for three 
or four years unless 
students approve a 
fee increase or the 

council cuts other areas of the budget.
Tension returned during open 

forum, when Associate Vice President 
of Local Affairs Aida Kuzucan took Aida Kuzucan took Aida Kuzucan
the floor to talk about the council’s lack 
of participation at the Dec. 2 La Jolla 
Christmas Parade.

“This past Sunday I sat on a side-
walk for a half-hour,” she started, 
before being interrupted by Biological 
Sciences Senator Emma Sandoe for Emma Sandoe for Emma Sandoe
speaking about council matters during 
open forum, which Sandoe said was a 
violation of Robert’s Rules.

“Are you serious?” Kuzucan asked 
repeatedly over Sandoe’s protests. “Let 
me finish. I sat on Sunday on the 
sidewalk for a half-hour dressed as an 
elf. No one showed up. No one felt the 
initiative to show up.”

Kuzucan had to inform event orga-
nizers that UCSD would not be partici-
pating in the parade.

Although she was visibly upset at 
the meeting, her dismay changed to a 
desire to increase council participation 
in local affairs next quarter, and just in 
time for New Year’s resolutions.

ings for several hours, employees were 
informed they would receive adminis-
trative leave for the day and were per-
mitted to go home, Deputy Director 
of University Communications 
Dolores Davies said.

Classes in nearby Center Hall 
were not canceled, though signs were 
posted warning passersby that there 
was a bomb scare across the street.

Foxworth declined to comment 
on the timeline of events leading up 
to the evacuation, and said he did 
not know when UCSD was initially 
aware of the threat.

However, Professional and 
Technical Employees Local 9 
President Carolan Buckmaster said 
that campus officials were informed 
of the threats as early as the evening 
of Dec. 4, but still had School of 
Medicine employees report to work 
the next morning.

Buckmaster said that workers in 
the building’s vivariums — facili-
ties in which animal research is per-
formed — were told that threats were 
directed toward “the animal facility.” 
They were also asked to “look for any 
more suspicious objects” before they 
evacuated, she added.

“The UC received a threat last 
night against an animal facility and 
they let employees into the building 
this morning,” Buckmaster said. “As 
one of the workers and a representa-
tive for the workers, we were very 
disappointed that the university let 
the employees into work today.”

which last year was languishing in 
funds. He said that the Grove is an 
ideal place for informal meetings with 
faculty members.

“Having students and faculty go 
to the Grove is a good, cheap alter-
native [to the Dine-With-a-Professor 
Program] and also helps an on-cam-
pus business,” Jafari said.  

According to Revelle Junior 
Representative Shibani Rajadhyksha, 
the program’s benefits include a $4 
pastry and beverage deal as well as the 
opportunity to meet with a professor at 
the Grove twice per quarter, in contrast 
to the one-time policy of a similar but  
older Revelle program, Dine-With-A-
Professor. 

Jafari credits the success of the pro-
gram to the communicative improve-
ments made the process of pairing of 
students with faculty. 

“Next Step has become a tighter-
run program and still has potential 
for continued growth and success,” he 
said. “The new partnership with the 
Grove can only offer more opportuni-
ties and a pleasant venue for relation-
ships to develop.”

While both Jafari and Rajadhyksha 
feel that the program has been benefi-
cial to Revelle students, they agreed that 
expanding it to become a campuswide 
program would be problematic. They 
already struggle to recruit enough fac-
ulty members from the most popular 
discipline choices, and said that cam-
puswide recruitment would be an even 
more difficult task.

According to Rajadhyksha, the 
program’s current success is due to the 
close personal relationships between 
program coordinators and specific stu-
dents and faculty. However, she said 
that she would support a larger-scale 
program if the A.S. Council agreed to 
organize it.

Barnett-Terry said she supports the 
program, and would also like to see it 
implemented throughout campus.

“I don’t think any college has a pro-
gram like this,” she said. “Some of these 
faculty members are inviting students 
into their homes. How many programs 
allow you into the life of a faculty mem-
ber at UCSD?”

▶ THREAT,THREAT,THREAT from page 1 A timeline of the day’s events will 
be released when more details are 
made public, Foxworth said.

Leichtag researcher and UCSD 
graduate student Minh-Ha Do, one 
of the employees evacuated from 
the building, said that her cowork-
ers appeared to have been aware of a 
threat more than an hour before the 
device was discovered.

“People knew of the threat by 
9 o’clock, and the alarm went off 
between 10:30 to 11 o’clock,” Do said.

Revelle College senior Rachel 
Intriago, another researcher at 
Leichtag, said  the building had 
received harassing phone calls from 
an animal-rights group the day before 
the threat was received. 

Buckmaster said that the Animal 
Liberation Front, a prominent ani-
mal-rights activist group, contacted 
Leichtag the night before and the 
morning of the threat.

“They said, ‘This is going to be 
huge,’” she said.

ALF representatives could not be 
reached for comment as of press time.

UPTE officials are planning to 
write a letter to Chancellor Marye 
Anne Fox detailing their grievances 
about how administrators handled 
the situation, Buckmaster said.

Though the comment period is now over regarding chang-es to UCSD’s free speech 
policy, the future of student free-
dom on campus remains nebulous. 
Input on the new guidelines was 
overwhelmingly negative — over 
half of respondents were against any 
form of regulation. The American 
Civil Liberties Union’s San Diego 
chapter has also jumped in the fray, 
concerned about the proposal’s 
legality  — particularly the section 
dictating that students who assem-
ble would need to obtain permits 
in advance, which would illustrate 
prior restraint on free speech. Now 
the university is forming a revision 
committee charged with address-
ing the comments and revising the 
proposal to accommodate students’ 
right to free speech while protecting 
their study environment.

There is no doubt that the cur-
rent proposal dangerously ignores 
student freedom. The changes 
transform a fair and effective policy, 
which has functioned for decades, 
into a tyrannical set of restrictions 
prohibiting even the most innocent 
of gatherings. By severely limiting 
the times and places people can 
congregate — even demanding that 
a group of 10 or more acquire a 
reservation to meet — the changes 

would be catastrophic to UCSD’s 
already-crippled campus livelihood. 
Meanwhile, the document’s cloudy 
language regarding enforcement and 
reservation rejection leaves the door 
open for administrative abuse.

The question now is what can 
be done to update the policy, while 
protecting and promoting free 
speech. The committee, which will 
have 16 members selected by the 
A.S. Council, Graduate Student 
Association, Academic Senate, 
Vice Chancellor of Business Affairs 
Steven W. Relyea and former Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs Joseph 
W. Watson, needs to listen carefully 
to the dissent, and work diligently 
to consider the views of the over 
90 respondents completely against 
the policy. 

The administration has been 
characteristically secretive about its 
specific motives for the changes, 
denying that religious activists or 
last year’s Dimensions of Culture 
debate influenced the proposal. This, 
however, leads students to be right-
fully wary of the extreme measures. 
The committee should participate 
in an open dialogue with university 
officials to better understand their 
concerns, and then incorporate that 
input with student comments to 
create a draft that accommodates 

UCSD’s research and study empha-
sis without impeding on students’ 
First Amendment rights.

The fact that the administration 
would present such an inherently 
oppressive draft, regardless of its 
motivation, speaks volumes about 
its disrespect for the student voice. 
The committee needs to carefully 
counterbalance this with meticu-
lous consideration of every possible 
implication that the final changes 
present. The group has the hugely 
important duty of guarding freedom 
in an instance that will impact stu-
dents for decades to come.

STUDENT LIFE — As ambitious as 
it is, changing the otherwise-barren 
social landscape of UCSD is possi-
ble. The creation of the Loft, a social 
lounge with a nightclub feel, repre-
sents the administration’s earnest 
effort to respond to concerns over 
the lack of an on-campus communi-
ty. Although the intentions behind 
the Loft are good, the presentation 
of the venue — even according to 
the administration’s own standards 
— is slightly off the mark.  

According to Seth Klonsky, pro-
duction manager at the University 
Events Office, the Loft was designed 

to have a relaxed and mellow feel 
and challenge the student body to 
become “a part of the club.”  Ideas 
ranging from an iPod jukebox to 
an LCD screen that momentarily 
displays the faces of entering cus-
tomers are just a few ways to make 
people feel a much more personal 
connection with the space. 

While these ideas are nice in theo-
ry, to play music through an interac-
tive medium such as an iPod jukebox 
would only cater to the musical tastes 
of the iPod’s owner, thereby alienat-
ing and possibly irritating the rest of 
the students in the club.

Furthermore, these new ideas 
will be experienced by a relative 
few, as the nightclub will have a 
capacity of approximately 130 peo-
ple — extremely small considering 
that it is supposed to be a bonding 
mechanism for the entire UCSD 
community.  This detracts from the 
core mission which, according to 
last year’s Undergraduate Student 
Experience and Satisfaction prog-

ress report, should aim “to address 
the need for a greater physical, 
social and emotional community.”  
To envision a tighter knit student 
body through a venue that can only 

accommodate a fraction of one col-
lege is strange enough, but to expect 
that such a goal can be achieved 
within a campus that is nearly 200 
times the venue’s size is simply pre-
posterous. 

Another alienating attribute of 
the Loft is the way it aims to be chic.  
The club will try to achieve this with 
a color palette that will undergo 
subtle changes — the lighting in 
the club will slowly dim as the day 
passes — and an open interior with 
a variety of ottomans and commu-
nal-oriented circular tables. 

The overly artistic and mature 
environment of the Loft also poses 
an issue, as it fails to serve diverse 
audiences. The narrow focus on the 
details of the nightclub may back-
fire, as it could seem too fancy and 
over-the-top for many college-age  
undergraduates. Furthermore, the 
food and drinks served in the Loft 
may disappoint — a menu of wine 
and tapas doesn’t exactly cater to  
the entire college crowd. 

All these amenities, while nice, 
seem to be designed for an older 
audience (such as UCSD gradu-
ates) and are not appropriate for 
the undergraduate demographic. 
Simply put, wine-sipping and for-

eign food will likely target too nar-
row an audience to fully achieve the 
community bonding the campus so 
desperately needs.

The University Events and 
Student Life Offices should look at 
other successful off-campus venues 
to get a better sense of what students 
want. 

By modeling itself to be more in 
tune with popular venues, the Loft 
could attract the students who would 
otherwise spend weekend nights at 
San Diego hot spots. In addition, the 
administration should increase stu-
dent involvement in planing these 
sorts of programs so it produces a 
venue that interests several sectors 
of the student body. This can be 
achieved  simply through a compre-
hensive survey that clearly demar-
cates one taste from another. Doing 
this would circumvent the possibil-
ity of creating a venue that is far too 
mature for undergraduate tastes, as 

Sorry, but I’m going to bypass the hole in the ozone layer, the Iraq War and the humanitar-
ian crisis in Darfur and get straight 
to the meat: your mouth.

You may be asking why I’m 
choosing to explore such an over-
looked part of everyday life. But 
language is so much more impor-
tant than we realize, because it not 

only conveys what we think, but also 
offers listeners a chance to find out a 
little about who we are.

For example, if you’re one of 
those people who enjoy saying “irre-
gardless” or “supposively,” you’re an 
idiot. If you say “amongst,” you’re 
stuck in the 1650s. If you pep-
per your speech with words like 
“impuissance,” “abstemious” or “ses-
quipedalian,” you’re a pompous ass-
hole. If you like to joke around with 
sexual words, you’re probably not 
funny. And if you hand over your 
card to the bartender and say “Keep 
it open,” you’re my best friend.

Language is constantly evolv-
ing, and for good reason. As social 
creatures, we need to be able to 
communicate effectively. If you’re 
not in on the latest lingo, you might 
find yourself unable to participate 
in common conversational topics. 
That’s why it’s so vital to understand 
the words around you, and, when 
necessary, invent your own words or 
phrases to accurately describe your 
personal life experiences.

Take, for example, the Q-gasm. 
It was invented to convey that ultra-
gratifying feeling of clean satisfac-
tion you get when you swab your ear 
canal and finally pull out the wax 
chunk that has been impeding your 
hearing for the last hour. 

To describe such a golden feeling 
in one word, you have to be savvy. 

The possibility of erecting a juris doctorate program at UCSD has always been just 
that — a possibility which, despite 
student support, has never fully 
materialized. 

Although such an implemen-
tation would broaden the narrow 
focus of the university’s graduate 
opportunities, funds have always 
run too short to realistically con-
sider the prospect any time in the 
near future.

Recent talks with the California 
Western School of Law, however, 
hint at bringing a legal-study pro-
gram to UCSD’s science-oriented 
campus. 

According to officials from both 
schools, they are currently consid-
ering partnership proposals that 
would support a joint program.

Though the alluring opportunity 
may win the hearts of faculty and 
students — many of whom have 
long hoped for a more developed 

legal-study program — campus 
officials should be cautious not to 
rush into a hasty partnership with 
Cal Western. Doing so, especially 
without an extensive plan to imple-
ment sweeping improvements to Cal 
Western’s currently mediocre pro-
gram, would significantly weaken 
the strength and prestige of UCSD’s 
academic reputation. 

It would be like jumping onto an 
already sinking ship.

Unlike the UC law schools, 
which are typically ranked among 
the top 50 law programs in the 
nation (known as tier-one schools), 
according to U.S. News and World 
Report, Cal Western consistently 
ranks among tier-four schools (the 
bottom 50, out of the nearly 200 
American Bar Association accred-
ited institutions nationwide).

Unless campus officials have a 
plan to boost its disappointing rank-
ing — a near impossible task given 
that jumping up in rank requires 

overtaking other already well-estab-
lished universities — UCSD would 
be best to continue wishing for the 
day when it has the funds to found  
its own law school. 

Otherwise it risks pouring money 
into an endeavor that would not 

only dissappoint the UCSD commu-
nity but the rest of the UC system 
as well. And after that, there are no 
second chances. 

Given these current circumstanc-
es, the prospect of a merger with Cal 
Western is simply too dangerous.

THURSDAY, DECEMBER 6, 2007 THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 5

I mean, you could simply say that 
it feels good to dislodge a stub-
born wad of earwax, but Q-gasm 
is so much better. So next time you 
and your friends are discussing oto-
hygiene, feel free to bust out the 
term. You won’t be sorry.

But it doesn’t stop there. There 
are many more words and phrases 
that everyone should know and use 
in order to maximize their vocab-
ulary and overall conversational 
skills.

The next time you see a flat 
ass walk by, call it a badinkadink. 
Or if the ass is big, yet ugly, it’s a 
badonkadon’t. 

Ever wondered about all those 
big-sunglasses-wearing girls on 
Library Walk who advertise Greek 
letters on their badinkadinks and 
badonkadon’ts? They’re called 
sorostitutes. 

And for those of you keen on 
homophones, the fun just keeps on 
coming. If you’ve ever called your 
friend dawg, homie, brohound or, 
god forbid, BFF — just stop. Not 
only do my ears bleed, you’re way 
behind the times.

There’s a new breed of word for 
you to use. And pronunciation-wise, 
it’s interchangeable with a different 
word that means ugly. (All you need 
to do is add an apostrophe for good 
measure. It’s as simple as that.)

That word is mofug, and it’s 
based on a modification of every-
one’s favorite expletive. Used in an 
example sentence, the word means 
“friend”: Hey mofug, what’s going 
on? 

But the fun begins when you 
strategically insert that aforemen-
tioned apostrophe between the O 
and the F to get mo’fug. Then, the 
word means “more fugly.” Again, 
used in an example sentence: Damn, 
she’s mo’fug than a fruit bat. (If you 
don’t think that’s funny, check out 
what a fruit bat actually looks like 
and then reassess your opinion. If 
you still don’t think it’s funny, die.)

Finally, I have to say that people 
need to stop acting so self-righteous 
and get over the constant taboo 
associated with certain words. For 
example, the words “nigga,” “retard-
ed” and “gay” are for some reason 
considered globally offensive in all 
situations. But definitions are con-
stantly evolving, and these words 
should only be labeled insulting 
when critically examined in con-
junction with the conversation’s 
context and tone.

Don’t get me wrong. True, legiti-
mate hate speech is disgusting, dis-
turbing and hurtful, but there are 
those occasional situations that are 
literally so stupid that they can only 
be described as “gay.” And where’s 
the harm in greeting your close 
friend as your “nigga”? 

A word’s meaning is much more 
than what “Webster’s New World 
Dictionary” lists; it’s about how you 
use it, when you use it and what 
your true intentions are. 

However, as with any term, don’t 
overuse these words or you’ll come 
off as a boring, uncreative idiot — 
save them for when they’re truly 
necessary to capture the essence of 
the moment you’re describing.

Language is an amazing tool. It 
lets us describe anything and every-
thing, and if there’s a term we can’t 
think of, we can invent something 
else in its place. 

And believe it or not, new lan-
guage happens in front of our eyes 
every day. In fact, it was just two 
years ago that Merriam-Webster 
adopted spyware, biodiesel, manga 
and unibrow. And this year saw 
the addition of crunk, microgreen, 
ginormous, smackdown, sudoku 
and telenovela.

That’s the beauty of language: flu-
idity. It’s interesting, it’s funny, it’s pro-
vocative, it’s exciting and it’s infinite. 

So use it to your advantage, nig-
gaz.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Campus Officials Failed to 
Warn Employees of Threat

Dear Editor,
We are not paid enough to be 

sacrificial victims, and we are not 
trained to be a bomb squad. 

On Dec 5. one of the staff work-
ing in the Leichtag Biomedical 
Research Building found a bomb. 

The bomb was a propane tank 
strapped with nails and shotgun 
cartridges. We were extremely wor-
ried for the well-being of all our 
research staff and animal techni-
cians that might have been harmed 
if the bomb had exploded. We are 
relieved that all ended well.

As the crisis abated, however, 
our relief turned to outrage. As we 
realized how our employer had dealt 
with the threat, UCSD received a 
bomb threat from an animal-rights 
group on the evening of Dec. 4 and 
again on the morning of Dec. 5. 

Rather than calling for trained 
bomb experts to thoroughly inves-
tigate the threat and warn all the 
staff working in the building, the 
animal technicians were just told 
to keep their eyes out for anything 
suspicious. 

Sheer luck avoided what could 
have been a massive humanitarian 
catastrophe leaving many injured or 
even dead.

That administrators at UCSD 
value our lives so little truly astounds 
and grieves us. 

We demand an investigation 
and consequences for the supervi-
sors and administrators that failed 
to warn employees first thing this 
morning and call in the appropriate 
authorities.

Our animal technicians are 
among the lowest-paid and hard-
est-working employees on campus. 
They have a true dedication to the 
wellbeing of the animals under their 
care. 

They deserve better, as do the 
rest of the staff in the building.

This Season, Opt for an 
Animal-Friendly Holiday

Dear Editor,
The holidays are upon us, and 

for most people this season conjures 
up images of friends family, and, of 
course, lots of food. 

However, this time of the year 
reminds me of UCSD, where, as 
a biology major studying animal 
behavior in 1997, I celebrated the 
holidays, for the first time, with 
vegetarian feasts.  

My decision to become a vege-
tarian stemmed from my experienc-
es working with bonobos (pygmy 
chimpanzees) during a special proj-
ect at UCSD. 

I started seeing these intelli-
gent and inquisitive animals in a 
whole new light and began extend-
ing this new vision to other ani-
mals — namely the animals I ate 
for breakfast, lunch and dinner. It 
was also at this time that I dis-
covered many of the hidden hor-
rors of factory farms: Egg-laying 
hens are crowded in tiny wire cages 
so restrictive that they can barely 
move, let alone nest or spread their 
wings; mother pigs spend months 
at a time nearly immobilized inside 
narrow metal crates; and turkeys are 
bred to grow large so quickly that 
their skeletons often cannot keep up 
with their abnormal body weight. 
Standard practices also include cas-
trating male calves and pigs without 
painkillers. 

How could I, someone who was 
a self-proclaimed animal lover, con-
tinue to eat some animals while 
working to protect others? The 
answer was easy: I couldn’t. 

After celebrating my 11th 
meat-free Thanksgiving this past 
November I’m now creating another 
delicious animal-friendly holiday 
feast for friends and family to enjoy. 
The options are endless: cashew nut 

roast with herb stuffing or a “meaty” 
mushroom loaf with mashed pota-
toes, gravy and traditional sides, 
that will satisfy everyone’s taste 
buds. Alternatively, I can run to 
the neighborhood grocery store and 
pick up a meat-free Tofurky roast 
with all the fixings. 

I’m hardly alone — millions of 
Americans are sharing their holiday 
spirit with the animals by celebrat-
ing with vegetarian foods. Make this 
holiday season a compassionate one 
by visiting TryVeg.com for quick 
and easy recipes that everyone can 
enjoy.

6  OPINION THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY, DECEMBER 6, 2007

By Charles Nguyen
Senior Staff Writer

LOCAL NEWS — Call me a politi-
cal tourist, the kind that visits a 
place and wishes it was home. Right 
now, San Diego is far from home 
for this young local native, who 
has visited a bevy of major cities 
like Los Angeles and San Francisco, 
which are more likable and liberal in 
policy. The problem with San Diego 
seems to be a political resume where 
old-school reigns. The city’s latest 
crusade against alternative lifestyle 
sees City Attorney Mike Aguirre 
standing against water bongs. 
Before that, he targeted beer on the 
beach. Even before that, the city 
took on medicinal marijuana. And 
in between, it was mini-dorms. All 
of California is moving to the left as 
America’s Finest 
City edges right-
wise, meanwhile 
shoving out the 
city’s youth.

Flubs rou-
tinely  come 
a d m i n i s t r a -
tively from all 
the aforemen-
tioned scandals, 
city officials 
adopting hard-
line stances 
that inherently 
excise the inter-
ests of their younger constituents. 

The latest issue involves the local 
sale of all water bongs, which is now 
prohibited under Aguirre’s cease-
and-desist mandate. Under the reg-
ulations, distributed citywide late 
November, every smoke shop must 
stop the sale of all paraphernalia 
— the expansive blacklist includes 
glass and water pipes, scales and any 
smoking accessories.

Aguirre hasn’t understated his 
mission’s intensity: the city attorney 
calls the shops “exploitative” places 
that sell a lot of “crap.” Breaking the 
rules can result in up to a year of 
jail time or a $1,000 fine per type of 
displayed illegal equipment. Aguirre 
said part of the problem is jargon-
related flexibility, where the shops 
dub paraphernalia with euphe-
misms to comply with state and 
federal laws. Supplies are used for 
legal tobacco smoking and, beyond 
that, the customer is liable.

What Aguirre considers com-

mercial deviousness, I consider a 
great moment in civic compromise. 
Much like the brown paper bag that 
conceals illegal alcohol presence in 
public, rewording terminology as 
it comes to paraphernalia provides 
the needed legislative space between 
the city and its citizens — it’s a 
“see-no-evil” understanding that 
this city seems to totally ignore. 
And until crime and drug use spills 
into the streets of Pacific Beach 
and Hillcrest, where many of San 
Diego’s smoke shops reside, there is 
no need for Aguirre to disturb that 
compromise.

Aguirre’s effort is the latest step 
in shrinking the world for college-
age San Diegans. 

Recently, the city and he went 
after beachside alcohol presence. 
The ridiculously overbearing pro-

posal instated a 
temporary ban of 
alcohol on local 
beaches.

Aguirre also 
masterminded the 
city council’s city-
wide move against  
mini-dorms. That 
plan was passed, 
and currently 
bars large groups 
of students from 
living together. In 
2006, San Diego 
County offi-

cials targeted medicinal marijuana, 
appealing a San Diego Superior 
Court decision to uphold state law 
permitting marijuana’s medicinal 
use.

As devil’s advocate, Aguirre is 
simply catering to his customer 
base. 

The bulk of San Diego’s populace 
is some combination of conserva-
tive, military, elderly and rich — all 
are voter types whose interests clash 
with smoking, drinking and college 
kids living together.

But where is the love for yup-
pies? What politician will stand for 
San Diego’s burgeoning young-adult 
population that supports the region’s 
most profitable industries, such 
as biology research? San Diego is 
becoming undeniably inhospitable to 
citizenry aside from the its elderly, 
home-owning demographic.

the Loft is currently doing.         
In a school where social hierar-

chies and parties have been replaced 
by study groups and weekly “Super 
Smash Bros.” tournaments, the Loft 
represents a fresh new challenge to 
nerdy norms. 

However, despite the genuine 

effort put into the venue’s envi-
ronment, the future success of the 
nightclub is hampered by several 
qualities that contradict the admin-
istration’s own guidelines for stu-
dent-life services.

12•7 The Golden Compass

I n the void left behind by “Lord of the Rings,” fantasy-adventure “The Golden Compass” arrives just in time to submerge kids and kids-at-heart in another children’s-
novel-turned-movie trilogy. This time, the mystical land is 
more familiar as an alternate-universe Oxford, where people’s 
souls physically manifest themselves as animals. The heroine, 
Lyra Belacqua (newcomer Dakota Blue Richards) must rescue 
her friend from the claws of villainous “gobblers,” using her 

trusty Alethiometer (a truth-telling gadget) and balls of steel 
to hunt for, of all things, dust. Throw in witches, talking polar 
bears and Nicole Kidman and you have one hell of a thrilling 
fantasy epic. And though there has been some grumbling about 
the film’s quality of special effects (not to mention the God-kill-
ing subtext), the lively pace and quirky storyline compensate for 
a shoddy-looking critter or junior theology lesson.

Juno

W hen tiny Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page) decides to break the news of impending fatherhood to 
lug-nut Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera), there’s only 

one way she knows how: She moves an entire living 
room set to his front lawn and greets him before a morning 

jog, sitting atop the very chair where they performed the deed, 
stove-top pipe clenched in her mouth. Such is the charm of Jason 

Reitman’s (“Thank You For Smoking”) sophomore effort, a film so 
sugary sweet and drenched in cute bitterness you’ll swear a trip to the 
dentist’s office has long been overdue. For filmgoers who have drawers 
devoted to multi-colored scarves, or who cried during the last Shins 
album, your annual indie messiah has arrived.

The encounter between the one-time lovers is only the tip of the 
iceberg for Juno’s unwanted venture into early adulthood. Knowingly 
incapable of raising a little one, she opts to hand the baby over to Vanessa 
(Jennifer Garner) and Mark (Jason Bateman), a couple who scream sub-
urbia. As the seasons drift by, Juno gets bigger, the teasing gets worse 

and her sources of comfort slowly disappear, leav-
ing only best friend Leah (Olivia Thirlby) and 
her almost too-understanding parents (J.K. 
Simmons and Allison Janney). She also 
finds a confidante in Mark, whose 
similar taste in punk music 
and B-horror flicks reveals

In Which 
the Editor 

Swears She’s 
Not a Bitch

R eally though, I haven’t always been such a bitter old wench. If nostalgia hasn’t obscured my 
self-image too entirely, I was actu-
ally quite an enjoyable companion 

and conversationalist in the old days 
— honest, curious enough to listen 
and generally nonjudgmental (okay, 
that last one is the nostalgia) — and 
by old days I mean pre-Hiatus, or 
roughly two years ago. We (yes, you 
and I!) could possibly have had a 
pleasant little chit-chat about which 
new film we wanted to attend or 
respectfully exchange opinions on 
any album released within the last 
couple years as if it was “current” 
—  and all without me ripping your 
throat out for assuming I’d want 
to discuss such an inconsequential 
topic as music with a fellow mortal 
such as you. Plus, if I’ve never heard 
of it — or especially if I have — it’s 
probably not worth clouding the 
moment of precious free time in 
which you’ve cornered me. What’s 
that you say? I’m afraid I don’t 
understand; my only known words 
belong to an exclusively awesome 
dialect known as sarcasm.

Most veterans of music writing 

T he year 2009: Will Smith is Earth’s last man. No, this isn’t Malcolm X’s dream finally realized, it’s this 
winter’s leading sci-fi plotline. 

American cinema’s fourth run at the 
classic 1954 Richard Matheson novel plops 
us into an apocalypse where Smith, a 
virologist turned one-man-army, grapples 
with day-to-day survival after a self-made 
infection morphs all humanity into can-
nibals. Smith spends his nine-to-five col-
lecting food, working out his pecs and 
touring a desolate New York City. Come 
night, Smith and his dog try to outlive 
their hunters, a vampire-like breed bent 
on bloodlust.

Originally, director Francis Lawrence 
was hot on the music video circuit, where 
“Legend’s” one-man-saves-the-world motif 
was Justin Timberlake’s one-dude-saves-
the-dance-floor. While “Rock Your Body” 
and “I’m a Slave 4 You” credits are typi-
cally resume killers, Hollywood has a way 
of turning shit to success; Lawrence made 
his feature-film leap with “Constantine,” 
Keanu Reeves’ comic-based foray into the 
dark arts. 

Director aside, “Legend’s” main draw 
is its visuals. Come Oscar season, the film 
could be sporting some heavy gold for its 
tech work, which generates flesh-eating 
humanoids en masse to take a chomp 
out of Smith’s fleeing ass. Also included: 
cinema’s most sweeping, awing annihila-
tion of an American landmark. Forget the 
Golden Gate’s destruction at Magneto’s 
hands in “X-Men: The Last Stand” and all 
that tripod mess in “War of the Worlds,” 
“Legend’s” missile attack on Brooklyn 
Bridge stands a cut above in visual wonder 
and thrill.

H ip-hop may claim the chip-munk sound effect as its own, but the founders of 
the movement were none other than 
Alvin and his two bros Simon and 
Theodore. It all started when Dave 
(Jason Lee), a failed musician, found 
the wily chipmunks causing a ruckus 
in his cupboard, and made a deal to 
adopt them only if they’d sing on his 
next album to impress his boss Ian 
(David Cross). 

The plot gets deeper, but going 
into detail would spoil the twists. 
Tim Hill, Hollywood director of 
“Garfield: A Tale of Two Kitties” 
fame, takes command of the 3-D 
animal actors as well as their 1-D 
human counterparts. Fingers crossed 
for a “Marmaduke” movie with Ted 
Danson.

I am Legend

Atonement12•7
A tonement” is exactly what it was intended to be: a World War II uber-melodrama about love and lies, and the most belliger-
ent Oscar bid since “Forrest Gump.” It’s brilliantly 
written, beautifully filmed, sublimely acted, coura-
geously directed and guaranteed to take home every 
single gold-plated Mr. Clean that the Academy can 
press out. It’s so good it will almost make you sick.

James McAvoy (“The Last King of Scotland”) 
and Keira Knightly are the grotesquely attractive 
lovebirds, who journey through a physically and 

emotionally deteriorated 1940s Europe as the war 
rages and hope begins to fade. Before the war, the 
two would have lived happily ever after if it weren’t 
for a sheltered, naive little girl, who jealously accuses 
Robbie (McAvoy) of a crime, not understanding the 
consequences and eventually regretting her allega-
tion. Cue the title, as she spends the rest of her life 
searching for a way to make things right amid the 
strains of war, with Robbie as a soldier struggling 
to find his way home and his Cecilia (Knightly) as 
a nurse heading toward the front, all hell breaking 

loose in the meantime.
Not much more can be said without ruining 

your holiday trip to the cinema. Suffice to say, 
people die and Santa Claus isn’t real. Even after 
an endless summer of wrist-splitters like “Surf ’s 
Up” and “Pirates,” there’s something to be said for 
the Hollywood system if it can so intentionally 
garner this much talent in one place and produce 
a masterpiece of such astounding caliber. If only it 
would do so more often.

— Josh Christensen

O n the heels of his acclaimed divorce downer-com-edy “The Squid and the 
Whale,” director Noah Baumbach 
returns with another talky expose 
on the family unit, “Margot at the 
Wedding.”

Margot (Nicole Kidman), a 
narcissistic writer who draws upon 
her own twisted family dynam-
ics, shares an inferiority complex 
with her betrothed sister Pauline 
(Jennifer Jason Leigh). Meanwhile 
groom-to-be Malcolm (Jack Black) 
loves Pauline dearly but is rebuked 
by Margot, branded the type of 
awkward putz the sisters rejected 
in high school. Hilarity ensues as 
the neurotic sisters jab at each 
other with the worst intentions. 
Go if you like biting exchanges 
between wasps, or if you’re into 
Jack Black shtick.

that I know look back on their time with an almost pitying fond-
ness that’s often worse than the overpuffed importance of those still 
immersed in the practice. Entertainment journalism is widely con-
sidered the least pressing of the journalistic practices, wrapped up in 
romantic details too specific to the artist or isolated scene in ques-
tion to solve any major political problems or expose social injustice 
or otherwise better the world for those more unfortunate than we.

And there is probably enough bad music writing (thought-
less, lauding press releases disguised in vague quirky-talk) to back 
up this brush-off a thousand times. But what I try to keep telling 
myself, tossing the front page aside for a sleepless night of squeezing 
chord sequences for meaning and attempting to wrangle the impos-
sible debate of what makes something good or bad, then assembling 
a self-satisfying string of perfect adjectives to form sound-imitating 
literary music of my own (or something retartedly optimistic like 
that), is that art is ultimately what the rest of all that “important” 
crap is for. Why try to be free, try to survive, try to better our eco-
nomic situations if not to finally just enjoy the rewards of human 
creativity?

So you see my dilemma. After being holed up in a dark room 
atop the Student Center (otherwise known as the Internet) for two 
years, trying to prove to myself there’s a purpose in tanking classes 
and relationships to obsessively write and design shit nobody even 
sees, I’ve become this confused, foggy-brained introvert — half 
wistful prophet and half music snob (coincidentally the two types of 
people I think I hate the most). Then there’s this  over-analysis of self 
to top off the mix with a seal of doom. So if I’ve brushed you off or 
alienated you with wordy pretentions, as I tend to do — maybe it’s 
only because I’m jealous. I get so caught up in writing and thinking 
about it that I forget to be part of it — I, the artless, who makes a life 
of observing and deciding the art of others.

In final review of myself, Hiatus Editor: two very enthusiastic 
thumbs down, but a few extra stars for effort, I suppose. And now 
to the three brave souls taking my place this winter. Christ: You’re 
a better man than I. Thanks for putting up with my Wednesday-
evening breakdowns, and good idea resisting my party pleads to 
stay home and watch movies instead. Koko Kisses: You made me 
remember what it feels like to be genuinely excited about music, and 
I want to fucking talk about it again. Seriously. Sonia (who could be 
heard saying, as I glared at a bloodied page of reads, “I hope Hiatus 
doesn’t turn me into a bitch”): You’re beautiful, and there’s no doubt 
in my mind you’ll keep the pages beautiful, no matter how you may 
doubt yourself. I’ve been there; it sucks, but there’s nothing like the 
feeling once you’ve made it out alive. Now pardon me while I hobble 
out like the old sap I am, off to a country where I can’t speak the 
language and Hiatus is nothing but an absence; where, with any 
luck, I can start acting like a normal person again. And maybe even 
liking it, just a little.

Ghostface Killah
■ The Big Doe Rehab
DEF JAM

T hough Ghostface threw quite the diva’s tantrum when his fellow Clansmen pushed their fifth official group release to Dec. 4, the same day Big Doe Rehab was set to drop, the New 
York rap titan must have known there wasn’t much to worry about. 
After all, he’s following up Fishscale (and underdog sequel More 
Fish) — arguably the most widely adored hip-hop album of 2006 
— and currently holding up all the popular dignity his ’90s-royal 
family still has, while the rest remain rutted in the same apathetic 
slump they’ve felt since 2004 (when Masta Killa’s No Said Date at 
least made a shadow of a blip on the scene’s radar). 

RZA, ever the peacekeeper, pushed the Wu’s 8 Diagrams another 
week (not that it made a difference — both albums leaked early any-
way); ironically, it’s Ghost that could have used the extra time. His 
newest foray into the brutally honest day-to-day of a recovering drug-
gie/criminal/playboy is 15 minutes and eight tracks shy of Fishscale, 
but that crunch makes all the difference — especially considering 

he has once again overenrolled the guest 
class (though this time, not behind the 

production boards, to a fault). “You 

gonna have to cut me off the track like cancer,” Beanie Sigel threatens 
on “Tony Sigel,” at which point he is actually faded mid-verse from 
an uneventful beat by Diddy producers the Hitmen.

“Supa GFK” (“Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it’s Ghost”) doesn’t 
even find enough time to separate the Killah’s vivid violence from 
an untouched Johnny Guitar Watson funk line beneath, distract-
ing proof that even the Clan king isn’t above the superhero trend. 
During every phoned-in chunk from members of both Theodore 
Unit and Wu-Tang, we can’t help but imagine how the stretch would 
instead sound in Ghost’s own buggy whimper, his left-field proper 
nouns and Crayola details scribbled into the dull cracks. (Not that 
the gigantic posse should be dismissed altogether; its presence gives 
him a necessary godfatherly, Mother Ginger countenance.)

Lyrically, Ghost only lets his weird-storm slack in miniscule 
increments, and even then it’s for lack of room; the Doom-less 
backdrop, however, is a much clunkier giveaway. 8 Diagrams 
ends up in quite the opposite predicament. RZA has had so 
much material rotting in the pipeline for so long that he’s obliged 
to come equipped with an updated set of thrashers to preserve 
his with-the-times reputation. The George Clinton-featuring 
“Wolves” creeps with spaghetti-western whistles and handclaps, 
and “Unpredictable” strains to keep Timbaland pace with skittish, 
metal-scraping turmoil. But when overlaid with obviously discon-
nected rhymes from the eight Wu staples and fringe-member 
Streetlife, the dinner party turns awkward and eerily irrelevant.

In a perfect world, Rehab would be extended and tossed the 
kind of wildfire beats we got on Fishscale, and 8 Diagrams would be 
compacted into a bonus EP. Or, better yet, Ghost and RZA would 
make nice already (the former only shows up on 3 Diagrams cuts) 
and admit that they’re meant for each other. The slow tin slide and 
Roots-y chorus of “Killa Lipstick,” Rehab’s signature elevator-eyes 
number, can’t handle the heat of snaky quips like “Double cokeheads 
who love cartoons/ Tight chicks who eat pussy, listen to Prince 
and play with they womb.” Conversely, Wu’s chorusy, Busta-esque 
“Starter” ticks with dark, schizo potential, but mundane lines like 

“All my independent Women/ Time to let your hair down” (from 
U-God) beg for the squirrely, nosy fetishes of Ghost, his flow 
permanently caught in an upward slant that never seems to hit 
the ceiling. But until these Clan heads find it in them to zen their 
midlife-crisis cranks, theirs is one hell of a racket to observe.

GiPOD200 Grill
Do you have a friend who longs to heat things 

up to the bangin’ beat of Britney Spears’ “Gimme 
More”? Well, the wait is finally over — culinary 
genius George Foreman has finally found a way 
to combine two life essentials: music and meat (or 
vegetables, if that’s your thing). From the master-
mind behind the grill that promises to “melt the 
fat right off” comes an MP3-playin’, indoor/out-
door electric grill. Complete with 10-watt amps 
and a speaker at its base, the new GiPOD makes 
roasting a whole chicken while simultaneously 

“supermanning that ho” a complete 
possibility. The GiPOD also features 
a 200-square-inch cooking surface 
and the same fat-separating technol-
ogy as its older cousin. This is the 
perfect present for friends who have 
backyard parties or that spunky granny of 
yours who loves to gangsta lean while she 
grills. In any case, youuuuuuuuuuu too can 
grill and groove.

— Autumn Schuster

Are your pockets feeling the punch this winter? Don’t 
worry — with the help of a few easy do-it-yourself gift 

ideas, you can still dazzle your friends without break-
ing your budget . The best thing about DIY gifts is 

that (if skillfully executed) they’re more personal 
than slapping a few hundred bucks down for the 

latest techie gadget.
An “inside joke” box is the perfect pres-

ent for your BFF, who’s sure to recall the 
moments of hilarity that make your friend-
ship special. Cut a hole at the top of a 
sealed cardboard box, then write shared 
jokes on individual cards and place them 
inside. Decorate with sentimental pho-
tos  (bonus points if they’re embarrass-
ing middle-school snapshots). 

For your significant other, a book 
of massage coupons is both easy and, 
more importantly, free. This is the gift 
that keeps on giving, and involves a 
mutual experience guaranteed to set 
the mood. Feel free to experiment with 
any other personal services you can 
think up (i.e. breakfast in bed coupons, 
lap dance coupons). 

For a brother or coworker, try fashion-
ing a personal beer bong. Ask the nearest 

pimply teenager working your local Home 
Depot — he’ll know what supplies work 

best and where to find them.
Finally, there’s the reason why DIY gifts 

were invented: mom. Of course, this is the 
one person who will love you unconditionally, 

no matter how much money or time you invest 
in her Christmas present. Regardless, the priceless 

macaroni picture frame or hand-drawn card is always 
a safe call and will evoke memories of those elementary 

school gestures of affection (before you totaled the car).

Made famous by “Lars and the Real Girl,” an ana-
tomically correct sex doll may just be the best present 

you’ll ever give. After all, hasn’t that bachelor brother of 
yours been lonely for long enough? What about the poor 

widow in your church choir? Everybody needs lovin’ — and 
Abyss Creations has the perfect solution. At www.realdoll.
com, you can choose from 10 customizable body types, 15 
faces and five different skin tones to create your recipient’s 
ideal PVC partner. Though the dolls may appear a bit expen-
sive at first glance, who can put a price on stress-free, undeni-
ably faithful companionship? To the tune of $6,500, these 
silicon beauties are a steal for that forlorn friend, who can 
have his/her wish list of “female,” “male,” even “she-male” 
sex appeal granted at the click of a mouse. The best part 
about the dolls is that they’re disease free, not to mention 
versatile — some models can change faces to spice things 
up at their owner’s whim. And if that’s not enough, you 
can order accessories like glow-cocks, extra wigs, or 
the flat-back torso of either gender. So, why not 
give the gift of a partner that never says no (or 
anything, for that matter) this holiday season?—  Autumn Schuster

I know only 
four things about 
this highly-antici-
pated video — how it 
begins, how it ends, that it’s 
seriously hardbody and will change 
street skateboarding forever. From 
what I’ve heard, the flick starts with 
everyone on the Lakai team doing 
a trick down a custom-made stair 
set — loaded with explosives. After 
the trick gets stomped, the stairs 
explode. So, if you know someone 
who likes skateboarding and shit 
that explodes — or skateboarding 
on shit that explodes — pick up 
“Fully Flared.”

Pyrotechnics aside, this video 
is supposed to be as revolutionary 
as Girl’s 1998 classic “Mouse.” This 
shouldn’t be surprising, given how 
much the two videos have in com-

mon: parts from Eric Koston, Mike 
Carroll, Rick Howard and — you 
heard me right — Guy Mariano. 
But, apparently the coup-de-grace is 
Marc Johnson’s epic three-song-long 
part at the end of the video. Johnson 
was recently crowned 2007’s Skater 
of the Year by Thrasher magazine, 
and rightfully so — he makes even 
the most hardbody of tricks look 
easy. His last trick, an ender-ender, 
has caused quite a buzz in the skate-
boarding rumor mill. If you care 
to find out why, go to your local 
skateshop on Friday, cop the DVD 
and see for yourself.

High-Def Holiday

If you want to do nature shows right, pick 
British. If you want to do nature shows even 
better, pick marijuana.

Both worlds can be simply combined for 
maximum environmental intimacy: Pop in 
BBC’s award-winning up-close documentary on 
the Earth’s myriad habitats. One puff, and that 
meerkat is wildly funny. Two, and you’re run-
ning with the meerkat. Three, and you are the 
meerkat. No show has better put us in mother 
nature’s shoes than “Planet Earth,” and no drug 
besides bud is able to do the same.

The box set of the David Attenborough-
narrated series is 550 minutes of nature’s pure 

visual glory. Viewers’ favorite images include 
the unadulterated gore on Africa’s plains to 
heartbreaking polar bears starving in a shrink-
ing Arctic environment.

The show surveys the globe’s remote ter-
ritories with every eye-pleasing device known 
to man: couch-grabbing time-lapses paint 
extended visions of night turned to day and 
slow-motion sees wolves devouring mice at 
painstakingly slow frame rates. “Oh snap!” has 
personally been a regular exclamation following 
such eye pleasers. Buy the high-def version to 
evoke more stoner glee.

“Fully
Flared”

The “Flight of The Conchords” 
season-one DVD is the mothaflip-
pin’ gift for that special (non-Aussie) 
friend. The foot-tapping HBO com-
edy series features New Zealander 
duo Jemaine Clement and Bret 
McKenzie — aka Flight of the 
Conchords — trying to make it in 
New York’s Lower East Side. Without 
money or a competent band man-
ager, the crazy kiwis must deal with 
gig drought, racism and threesomes 
(not to mention Bowie). In each 
of the 12 episodes, the Conchords 
break into hilarious folk-parody acts 
to comment on various painfully 
ironic situations and on their attrac-
tion to American women (“Yes, 
sometimes my lyrics are sexist/ But 
you lovely bitches and hoes should 
know I’m trying to correct this”).

A fter “Knocked Up” and “Superbad,” the armies of Judd Apatow try to go three for three with “Walk Hard,” a blitzkrieg strike on popular musician 
biopics. The “Spinal Tap” offspring parodies Hollywood rags-
to-riches narratives, following the fictional Dewey Cox (John 
C. Reilly) through a traumatic childhood, backup-singer 
affair and rock-star demise, brought on by his addiction to 
every drug under the sun. Witnessing John Lennon (Paul 
Rudd) call Paul McCartney (Jack Black) “a fat cunt” will 
likely be worth all ten bucks.

D irector Tim Burton puts scissors back into the hands of Johnny Depp, 
this time with a barber’s smock in 
the screen adaptation of Stephen 
Sondheim’s powerhouse musi-
cal “Sweeney Todd: The Demon 
Barber of Fleet Street.” As an 
unjustly imprisoned man, Depp’s 
Todd submits to the madness and 
grief of losing his loved ones and 
vows to use his barbershop upon 
escape to exact bloody revenge. 
Recycling what seems to be half 
the “Harry Potter” cast, “Todd” fea-
tures Alan Rickman (the evil Judge 
Turpin), Helena Bonham Carter 
(partner-in-crime Mrs. Lovett) and 
Timothy Spall (slimy henchman 
Beadle Bamford) alongside the 
man who polished the role of the 
nobly immoral antihero as Captain 
Jack Sparrow. Full of entrancingly 
horrific imagery and armed with 
an experienced cast, “Todd” is 
poised to be another prized addi-
tion to the Burton/Depp wall of 
fame, right between “Corpse Bride” 
and “Edward Scissorhands.”

W e thought that influen-tial “Godfather” and “Apocalypse Now” direc-
tor Francis Ford Coppola had ended 
his career with “Jack” back in 1996. 
But now, Coppola steps off his Napa 
Valley vineyard to tell the story of 
an aging professor’s life-awakening 
hours before the onset of World War 
II. That the professor is played by the 

finest of character actors, Tim Roth 
(“Pulp Fiction”), makes Coppola’s 
stab at cinematic resuscitation all the 
more curious. Whispers surround-
ing “Youth” say Coppola’s in fine 
(if slightly flawed) form. While he 
may not have rediscovered his own 
youth, he’s at least set the moviemak-
ing wheels back in motion.

E veryone knows how smoothly eggnog goes down, especially with some Denzel Washington: 
that cheek-to-cheek grin; that curdled 
intensity; that cock-eyed stare; that 
timbre-rattling cackle are all holiday 
mainstays as much as Santa’s fat ass.

This year, America’s storied tra-
dition of “Christmas-then-a-movie” 
flaunts its expected pomp and tinsel 
with Washington’s latest vehicle, the 
unabashedly uplifting “The Great 
Debaters,” which follows a group of 
quick-lipped kids through Jim Crow-
era racism. The budding upstarts 
don’t lack in heart, but need Denzel-
caliber direction to beat out their 
highbrow competitors at Harvard.

Washington’s return to the direc-
tor’s seat, after a terrific directing/
acting turn in the expertly tender-
ized “Antwone Fisher,” jumpstarts 
what could otherwise be a holi-
day-day yawn. Naysayers envision 
another “Remember the Titans,” and 
it’s not that far a stretch: “fight for 
your right to play football” turns into 
“fight for your right to debate,” and 
both see Denzel doing the father-
figure thing against a civil-rights-
movement backdrop. But only in 
“Debaters” will audiences get Denzel 
laying verbal whoop-ass on snooty 
ivy-leaguers — surely a new way to 
enjoy Christmas.

H ow do Americans con-duct politics, and how do Americans conduct war? 
“Charlie Wilson’s War” has the same 
answer for both questions: with cha-
risma. And with Tom Hanks, Julia 
Roberts and Phillip Seymour Hoffman 
behind the masks of the power players 
involved, the charisma is palpable. 

If you’re not a poli-sci major, you 
likely know next to nothing about U.S. 
involvement in the Russia-Afghanistan 
war of the 1980s. Or even that Russia 
was ever in Afghanistan, or that our 
covert involvement helped us in the 
Cold War. But neither did Charlie 
Wilson (Hanks) — that is, until politi-
cal operator Joanne Herring (Roberts) 
got a hold of him. 

Before that, Wilson was just like 
any other coke-snorting, whisky-
guzzling, womanizing congressman. 
Sure, he’s still a guileless son-of-a-
bitch when the movie’s over, but his 
accomplishments in the meantime 

— with the help of CIA operative Gust 
Avrakotos (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) 
— is astounding. Wilson wheels and 
deals with foreign dignitaries in a 
thick Texan drawl, building a tenuous 
alliance to buy and distribute Russian 
weapons for Afghan insurgents while 
keeping domestic scandals under 
wraps. Gust makes deadpan remarks 
as Wilson sips booze, surrounded 
by his army of gorgeous secretaries. 
Although Roberts may be just another 
wide-eyed starlet who takes up screen 
time, Hanks and Hoffman are masters 
of the acting craft, and their scenes 
together are the heart of the film.

But “Charlie Wilson’s War” isn’t just 
about cocaine and strippers, fast-talk-
ing congressmen and low-cut blouses. 
As witty as the characters are, their 
story teaches a tragic lesson about the 
way our country conducts itself in the 
world, and about the consequences of 
our shortsightedness.

THURSDAY, DECEMBER 6, 2007 THE UCSD GUARDIAN HIATUS  15

By Simone Wilson
Hiatus Editor

T he only way one could hope to butcher a parody as hardened as John Waters’ 1990 Americana 
campfest “Cry-Baby” — starring a 
fresh-from-puberty Johnny Depp at 
its gyrating rocka-hillbilly core — 
would be to miss the humor in its 
more subtle cultural jabs. But subtle 
in a Waters piece could still sock 
us in the eye from clear across the 
drive-in; tucked into the cozy La Jolla 
Playhouse cavity, we are positively 
pummeled. The stage adaptation of 
Waters’ youthful “Not Another Teen 
Movie”-strain celebration in 1950s 
stereotypes was guided through all 
stages of production by the strangeling 
himself — following up the Broadway 
success of his slightly less-perverted 
“Hairspray” — and the new script 
hammers the film’s original mocking 
points so hard that “Cry-Baby” even 
begins to parody its own parodies.

We begin, of course, at the annual 
anti-polio picnic, where diseases are 
icky (along with UFOs, weirdos and 
communists) and square is the only 
way to roll. But when a gazebo-crash-
ing gang of big-bad drapes roar in 
from stage right, the small get-togeth-
er soon balloons into an all-company 
summarization of the film’s entire 
first quarter, squished into a polio-
vaccination needle and rammed up 
our overstimulated behinds. How 
mean are these greasy leather-jackets 
from across the tracks? “So damn 
mean that we don’t like Ike!” Why 
does this grown baby cry? “It’s like 
callin’ someone curly when they don’t 
have hair!” That’s right — the woeful 
orphan’s nickname was born of cold 
irony, because one solitary tear is all 
his lonely left cheek will ever wick. 

Lead actor James Snyder (resem-

bling a baby-fattened, more flam-
boyant Robert Downey Jr.) may not 
writhe with the same knee-weaken-
ing smolder as Johnny — hell, who 
could — but his stupider sexlessness 
allows us to snap any last longings of 
belief and sit back for this upgraded 
parade of bubbling superficiality, 
never without a few extra helpings 
of American cheese. But Cry-Baby’s 
rock-star spasms are apparently 
enough to win over one particular 
square in pink: the blonde-blonde 
Allison, played by an abrasive, almost 
rubbery-voiced Elizabeth Stanley. By 
the time the garden-party number 
has wound from its whirling class 
war, the devil’s-music posterboy and 
his object of repressed lust are already 
in the throes of professing “infection” 
with each other’s sudden love. It’s 
certainly one of the faster-moving 
Romeo/Juliet relationships, but in a 
Pleasantville this sexually deprived, 
one can’t help but get a little carried 
away. (So far, in fact, as to request a 
slip of pink mouth-muscle later that 
night on a racy escape to makeout 
point. Ooh la la!)

For all its inevitable exaggerations, 
“Cry-Baby” does admirably dodge a 
few key cliches of musical theater, 
with some scenes reaching a novel 
level of strangeness. Psycho groupie 
Leonora loosens one more screw 
with every scene-stealing cameo, tak-
ing the lopsided Turkey Point stage 
for a feverish solo and acting out 
her matrimonial fantasies alongside 
head-square Baldwin (Christopher 
J. Hanke) in a brilliant bridal-shop 
romp. Though the film’s original cli-
max — Alison’s siren-steamy “Please 
Mr. Jailer” — is sidestepped com-
pletely, its memory is soon stomped 
out by the passive-aggressive tension 
of “A Little Upset,” a feat in gymnas-
tic “Stomp” choreography that sees 

a herd of pent-up inmates (“I must 
have woke up on the wrong side of 
my rat-infested cot”) give the Wiffle 
cheerleaders a shackle-shattering run 
for their bake-sale money. 

In an overkill only musical theater 
could aspire to, the Playhouse’s clos-
ing scene looks “We Go Together” 
from “Grease” straight in the eye for 
the most obvious of all the play’s 
parodies, “Nothin’ Bad’s Ever Gonna 
Happen Again.” As if to prove there’s 
no way they could have taken this 
Waters business too far, the cast’s three 
nonwhite members skip center stage, 
lit up by a glittering rainbow Ferris 
wheel, and declare racism a thing of 
the past; “Kumbaya!” harmonizes the 
line of cracker-jacks behind. “That’s 
the moral of the story,” the squares 
and drapes sing, finally finding some-
thing they can agree on: “Everything 
is hunky-dory!”

“Cry-Baby” continues its run at the 
La Jolla Playhouse until Dec. 15.

Is there any better way to kick off your holiday merriment than with David Lynch? There’s 
more than your usual share of weird in this industrial tomorrowland of foreboding black and 
white, as Henry Spencer must play daddy to his girlfriend’s mutant baby, unaware of the 
truths that underlie the tot’s genealogy. “Eraserhead” was our invitation to Lynch’s carnival 
of confusion manifested in later masterpieces like “Blue Velvet,” and it’s grainy brilliance 
is clearer then ever in a new 35mm print at two midnight screenings at the renowned Ken 
Cinema. (CM)

a new image of him, as well as hidden 
tension between the married W.A.S.P.s

But what will capture you, dear pop-
ulist hipsters, is Reitman’s attention to 
character detail, from Paulie’s addiction 
to tic-tacs to Juno’s obscure reference to 
her unborn child as a “sea monkey.” It 
seeps all the way into the dialogue, laced 
with verbal oddities like “Wizards!” 
to indicate Paulie’s deep awe, or Juno 
shouting “Thundercats Ho!” to imply 
her water has broken. Half the fun is 
waiting to hear what absurd thing will be 
uttered next. This seamlessly combines 
with the chilly Michigan neighborhood 
the characters inhabit, every color of 
the land so stark that the environment 
changes with the characters.

The film owes more than its 
fair share to predecessors like “I 
Heart Huckabees” and granddaddy 
“Rushmore,” which is probably not a 
discredit to Reitman, whose “Smoking” 
two years prior proves he’s more 
than a style-stealer — yet the signal 
from audiences is that they’ve already 

grouped “Juno” into the grotesque 
genre of “quirky comedy.” It’s a shame, 
since “Juno” is a fine film — albeit not 
a new initiate into the classic cinematic 
canon, like “Rushmore,” but deserving 
far more credit than another predict-
able marketing label slapped across 
its forehead. And yet after the sudden 
success of “Little Miss Sunshine,” every 
studio and thrift-store stock girl wants 
to buy in on the next big thing, and 
it looks like festival-darling “Juno” is 
the latest casualty. Soren Kierkegaard 
wrote: “Once you label me, you negate 
me,” so do this enjoyable slice of 2007 
a favor — stop the branding and let it 
bask in its own fleeting beauty.

THURSDAY, DECEMBER 6, 2007

By Janani Sridharan
Senior Staff Writer

UCSD’s club ice hockey team is 
looking to improve upon a medio-
cre start to the season, including a 
5-4 overall record, in order to earn a 
playoff berth and make a push to the 
national championships when their 
schedule continues after winter break.

UCSD’s latest game was a 7-4 road 
loss to UC Irvine on Nov. 30, during 
which the Tritons got off to a bad start 
and allowed three early goals in the first 
period. The Tritons managed to take 
one of those goals back with a score by 
freshman wing Stephen Lockwood at 
the end of the first period.

The Tritons picked up the pace in 
the second period as junior wing Ken 
Yamashita scored two goals. 

“We were feeling really positive 
going into the third period with the 
score 5-4,” Yamashita said. 

The Tritons’ fortunes turned in 
the third period, as the Anteaters 
outscored them 2-0 to seal the win. 
Penalty troubles hurt the Tritons in 
their comeback attempt and ultimately 
contributed to the loss.

“We got out to a bad start in the 
game,” junior wing Alex Azuma said. 
“We were disorganized in the begin-
ning and weren’t playing cohesively. 
We battled back but then had some 
unlucky calls that didn’t go our way 
near the end.” 

The Tritons have had some disap-
pointments this season, which is to be 
expected from a team that has only one 
senior on its roster.

“I think that we could be playing a 
lot better, but we have a pretty young 
team this year,” Yamashita said. “We 
only have one senior, and the majority 
of team is underclassman.”

Even with their struggles, the 
Tritons have had success this season 

and their record, despite the loss to 
UC Irvine, is evidence of the team’s 
resilience. UCSD’s wins have come 
against Sacramento State University, 
Cal State Northridge, the University of 
Redlands and two against College of 
the Canyons.

According to Azuma, UCSD’s 8-5 
win over CSU Northridge on Oct. 
13 was its greatest victory so far this 
season.

“We played a consistent game in all 
three periods against CSU Northridge,” 
he said. “It was physical, hard-hitting 
game and we played aggressively on 
our zone defense.” 

The Tritons have a break before their 
next game on Jan. 18 against Loyola 
Marymount University. UCSD will 
then take on the University of Redlands 
on Jan. 19, playing the Bulldogs for the 
second time this season. 

The Tritons will be looking for con-
tinued production from a few key play-
ers who have stepped up in the first half 
of this season. In addition to Yamashita, 
junior center Troy Miller and sopho-
more wing Kenny McCubbins have 
been key offensive players for UCSD. 
On defense, sophomore goaltender 
Ben Cohen has stepped up in his first 
season as the starting goaltender. 

“He’s definitely been a big factor in 
our games, stepping up and making 
really good plays,” Azuma said. 

UCSD has high expectations for the 
rest of the season, hoping to acquire a 
good position in the playoffs and a shot 
at the national championships.

“I expect nothing less than win-
ning all the way through the rest of the 
season,” Yamashita said. “We still have 
our toughest game against Northern 
Arizona and we could really boost our 
rankings if we win our games.”

Barry Bonds, the all-time home run king, has finally been indicted.
So to all you Barry-haters out there, 

before you pop open a bottle of your 
finest champagne to celebrate the 
demise of baseball’s legendary villain, 
ask yourself why Bonds’ indictment 
is being hailed as the ultimate victory 
against cheating in professional sports. 
Ask yourself why so much attention 
has been focused on the exploits of one 
man, while the sports world around him 
cannot itself boast a spotless record.

As hard as it is for me to admit, 
Barry is an asshole. Being a die-hard 
Giants fan, it took me years to realize 
it — and it breaks my heart to this day. 
A childhood spent idolizing the man 
led me to develop a glorified image of 
him. No matter how many times he 
turned down my requests for a simple 
autograph throughout my youth, I still 
adorned my walls with his posters and 

memorized all of his Hall of Fame-
worthy statistics.  

With the indictment charges, it 
now seems that Bonds began dab-
bling with the juice in 1998, setting in 
motion a span during which he broke 
both the all-time single season and 
career home run records and won four 
straight MVP awards from 2001-04. 
And he did it all at a point in his career 
when most ball players retire because 
of tired knees or blown-out elbows. 

Of course, Bonds skeptics ignore 
the fact that he batted .360 and won 
the National League batting title one 
year removed from breaking the single 
season mark. Surely, having bigger 
muscles must allow you to have the 
patience and hand-eye coordination 
to take a breaking pitch to the opposite 
field for a clean single, right? 

Also left out of the Bonds debates 
are his 500 stolen bases, most of which 
were recorded before his supposed 
steroid use. Now, with public opinion 
vehemently against him, it is ironic that 
Bonds was the leading vote-getter for 
the All-Star Game for over a decade, 
chosen by fans year in and year out 
as their most respected and idolized 
player. 

But none of this means anything 
anymore, because I guess Bonds is a 
cheater. Every single one of his home 
runs should have an asterisk next to 
them and Marc Ecko should be made 
the new commissioner of baseball. 
And the Hall of Fame? Forget about 
it; no way should a cheater like Bonds 
have a plaque that graces the same 
sacred wall as Ty Cobb, an unimagina-
ble bigot and self-admitted murderer. 

Bonds’ critics abound, and reasons 
for his standing as baseball’s anti-hero 
range across the spectrum from moral-
ity to racism. To those of you out 
there who blindly hate Bonds, but can-
not give me any more reason than 
“he cheats,” take a good look around 
and open your eyes to the sad real-
ity that he’s not sports’ only cheater. 
Unfortunately for him, he just happens 
to be the only one who holds a major 
record and is harder to get along with 
than a strand of syphilis. 

As baseball’s bad-boy, Bonds could 
never be given the benefit of the doubt 

Strong Start Brings High Hopes
By Joe Tevelowitz
Senior Staff Writer

After impressive victories over 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association rivals Cal State 
Stanislaus and Chico State, the 
men’s basketball team has opened 
its regular season home schedule 
with back-to-back victories for the 
first time since its 2004-05 season. 
The Tritons will look to win their 
third-straight home game to open 
the season on Dec. 6 against Alaska 
Fairbanks, something the team has 
not accomplished since the 1998-99 
season, prior to UCSD’s move to 
Division II. 

With a 2-0 conference record 
and 2-2 record overall, UCSD will 
attempt to even up the all-time 
series with Alaska Fairbanks, cur-
rently in the Nanooks’ favor at 2-1.

Sophomore forward Andrew 
Browning was pleased with the 
Tritons’ fresh start at home and 
attributed the wins to the team’s 
preparation.

“I think that the two wins we 
pulled out this weekend were very 
important,” he said. “We have been 
working really hard in practices, 
preparing for league [games] and 
winning our opening games gives us 
some momentum.

According to Browning, home-
court advantage played a role in the 
team’s victories.

“Starting off the league season 
at home ended up being beneficial 
for us,” he said. “It was great to 
see some support from the students 
who came out and I know that we 
fed off their energy.”

In the season’s early stages, UCSD 
has exhibited a deeper lineup, with 
10 players having played in each 

of the four games, and three play-
ers averaging double-digit points, 
led by sophomore guard Jordan 
Lawley at 11.5 points per game. 
The Tritons also have three players 
averaging over two assists per game, 
led by senior guard Clint Allard’s 
5.5, and three players averaging four 
rebounds or more per game, again 
led by Allard at 6.8 per game. In 
comparison to last season, only two 
UCSD players averaged more than 
two assists per game — junior guard 
Kelvin Kim at 3.8 and Allard at 3.7 
— and junior forward Shane Poppen 
was the only Triton to average more 
than four rebounds per game. 

As a team, UCSD holds advan-
tages over its opponents in assists 
and rebounds, as well as three-point 
field goal percentages. The Triton 
offense this season has appeared 
much more fluid, yielding more 
open shots and opportunities, with 
the team collectively shooting 39.5 
percent from long distance.

Poppen, who is averaging four 
rebounds this season in addition to 
6.3 points in 19.5 minutes per game, 
credited the squad’s better cohesion 
for its marked success.

“Unselfishness is key in our 
offense,” he said. “Our offense is a 
lot less rigid this year allowing for 
more freedom on the offensive end. 
The freedom allows our team to be 
more creative, but we also know to 
stay within the framework of the 
offense and set hard screens getting 
other people open.”

Some of this season’s early suc-
cess can be attributed to the Triton’s 
new head coach Chris Carlson. In 
his first-year at UCSD, Carlson has 
demonstrated strong leadership SANH LUONG/GUARDIAN

Junior forward Henry Patterson’s play in the paint is a big reason for the Tritons’ early success with 
opponents regularly focusing on and fouling Patterson, which creates open shots for his teammates. See BASKETBALL, page 19

skills and basketball knowledge 
while establishing a solid connec-
tion with his players.

“[Carlson] has definitely had a 
positive impact,” Poppen said. “He 
drives us to be the best team we can 
be and truly believes in us.”

Browning, who has more than 
doubled his points- and rebounds-
per-game totals from last season and 
emerged as a key Triton reserve and 
frontcourt stalwart, echoed Poppen’s 
sentiment, saying that Carlson is 
taking the Tritons in the right direc-
tion. 

“Coach Carlson has done a great 
job [in] his first year here,” Browning 
said. “He has made the transition of 
the coaching change go smoothly 
and has really exceeded my expecta-

tions coming into the year.”
According to Browning, 

Carlson’s rave reviews stem from his 
approachability.

“He is a great player’s coach [and] 
is very easy to talk to on and off the 
court,” Browning said. “His style 
of coaching sets us up for success. 
He incorporates competition into 
everything we do in practice and 
makes sure that we are always play-
ing as hard as we can to win.”

The Tritons will look to push 
their early-season record to above 
.500 against Alaska Fairbanks, but 
the Nanooks will not bow easily.

“Alaska Fairbanks is a really good 
team and have beaten some good 
Division I schools,” Browning said. 
“They are going to be a tough team 
to beat, but if we bring the intensity 

on defense we played in our last two 
games, we will have a great chance 
of winning.”

Following their matchup with 
Alaska Fairbanks, scheduled for 7 
p.m. at RIMAC Arena, the Tritons 
will continue their homestand 
against William Jewell College on 
Dec. 16 at 3 p.m. and against Wayne 
State on Dec. 18 at 7 p.m. 

The Tritons will play two more 
games in January before UCSD 
classes resume for Winter Quarter, 
traveling to face CCAA oppo-
nents Sonoma State on Jan. 4 and 
Humboldt State on Jan. 5, with 
both games scheduled for 7:30 p.m. 
tipoffs.

Tritons Responding Well to New Coach

Junior guard Kelvin Kim finds a lane to drive to the basket between two Cal State Stanislaus defenders during UCSD’s Nov. 30 win over the Warriors.

for his actions. For the public to forgive 
a player, or a team, for cheating, they 
have to be able to win the hearts of fans 
and portray an image of good old-fash-
ioned Americana. 

Take the case of the unstoppable 
New England Patriots, for example. 
Winning three Super Bowls usually 
tends to put you in fans’ good graces, 
and right now the Pats have a fan base 
as big as their average margin of vic-
tory. It can’t hurt to have a quarterback 
like Tom Brady, who is just as comfort-
able on the cover of GQ as he is under 
pressure from a safety blitz, either.

But the New England Patriots 
are cheaters. Their head coach, Bill 
Belichick, was fined for stealing signals 
from the opposing team, and according 
to sources, it wasn’t the first time. Many 
football fans and players will say that 
what Belichick did isn’t a big deal, that 
all teams steal signals. But statements 
like that is eerily similar to the fact that  
Bonds is by no means the lone juicer 
in baseball. Within the ranks of base-
ball’s nice guys, names such as Gary 
Matthews Jr., Miguel Tejada and Matt 
Williams have been linked to steroids. 
So why is it that the Patriots’ brand 
of cheating is virtually ignored while 
Bonds faces a nation-wide witch-hunt? 

Arguing that New England’s cheat-
ing is not as bad as Bonds’ is like trying 
to justify one murder over another. I 
don’t care if you think Bonds cheated 
— he did — but you should not be 
allowed to pick and chose which cheat-
ers you want to persecute. 

Around the time that Bonds was 
approaching Hank Aaron’s all-time 
home run record, a columnist for the 
San Francisco Chronicle, Gwen Knapp, 
suggested that Barry retire one home 
run short as a sign of respect for the 
game and as a way to make amends for 
his previous wrongdoings. However 

unrealistic it may have been, it was a 
nice thought and would have surely 
quieted the majority of Bonds’ critics. 
Let’s not abandon that noble gesture, 
but instead apply it to the aforemen-
tioned cheaters: the Patriots.

Only one team in NFL history, 
the 1972 Miami Dolphins, has ever 
gone undefeated for an entire season, 
but this year’s Patriots seem to have a 
legitimate shot at repeating the incred-
ible feat. If the Pats are 15-0 going 
into the season’s final Sunday, I call 
on Belichick to forfeit the game to 
acknowledge his fraudulent ways and 
teach all of America’s youth that it is 
unacceptable to cheat. Retiring before 
hitting number 756 would have been 
the greatest sign of honor to Hank 
Aaron and to the morality of the game. 
Likewise, conceding the 16th win of 
the season would illustrate Belichick’s 
willingness to play the game the right 
way, and would be a tribute to the 1972 
Dolphins, who we can safely assume 
didn’t use video technology to cheat.

Obviously we all want to move past 
this tainted era of cheating and schem-
ing and hope that our beloved sports 
teams can return to the days of yore 
when games were decided by grit and 
determination. But using Bonds as a 
scapegoat will not help us get there any 
sooner; it will only create animosity and 
foster future discontent among both 
players and fans. Just be happy with 
the fact that Bonds has been indicted 
and will most likely now retire from the 
game. Let him steal away into the night, 
leaving his home run total to be broken 
by a future slugger. I implore you to 
show him respect that, as a player, he 
never fully showed you as a fan. Be the 
bigger person and remember him as 
the great player that he was, one who 
loved the game and loved his team. To 
err is human, to forgive divine, so cut 
Barry some slack and move on.

Forfeit Pefection for Honor
