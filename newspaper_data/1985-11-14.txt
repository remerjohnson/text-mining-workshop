With the first meeting between President Reagan and Soviet leader

its attention toward Geneva with hopes of peace in potential arms 
limitations and improved relations between the two superpowers. 

However, as the summit date draws near, its high expectations grow 
dim. At UCSD, an institution known for fostering both the political

would also give a sense of 
accomplishment to all people 
associated with the univerSity, 
Ramseyer said . 

"Commul11ty support ...

Eighty-three reports of stolen 

bicycles or bicycle pans were 
reported to the UCSD police 
between January I , 1985, and 
October 27, 1985, said a report 
from UCSD police officer Clark 
Martin . The report said the total 
financial loss of parts and 
bicycles cam~ 10 $11 .978. 

The Police Department 
registers bicycles and encourages 
owners to engrave their bicycles 
with identifying marks such as a 
California driver's license 
number. 

The CO's leave noces 
occaSIOnally reminding the 
owner of the tagged bike to lock 
the bike or to use a more 
substantial lock. 

Cafe may provide 
alternative 

The new coffee house 
scheduled to open by the end of 
the next quarter outSIde the 
Crafts Center IS sull in ItS 
conceptual stages. according to 
Brad Silen. ASSOCiated Students' 
adVlser on the cafe 

Silen, who mitlally became 
mvolved in AS to promote the 
idea of a campus coffee house , 
expressed some skepticism of it 
ever becoming a realiry. Greater 
Interest and financial suppOrt of 
the cafe must be generated in 
order for it to open next quarter 

or at all , Silen said . 
An alternative to other eanng 

establishments on campus, the 
coffee house concept arose last 
year from the collaborative efforts 
of the Associated tudenrs and 
the Crafts Center. Their idea was 
to create an informal 
environment conducive to 
intellectually stimulating 
conversation. omplcmented by 
good , stimulating coffee, Silen 
explained. He also noted that 
similar coffee houses at other 
university campuses are very 
popular. As the AS represents the 
various Interests groups on 
campus, the AS Cafe will provide 
place for these diverse interests 
to interact, Silen believes. The 
comfortable atmosphere will be 
inviting not only to students, 
but also to employees of the 
university and members of the 
community, he added . 

Silen perceives the coffee 
house as a creative alternative to 
the campus' beer bashes of the 
past, or as a place to unwind 
after a visit to the nearby pub 
before going home. Extensive 
serving hours will adapt to any 
lifestyle. 

'The cafe offers something to 
the entire student body" and 
therefore is "highly Justifiable for 
AS funding ," Silen said.

Diverse students 
share cultures 
By BARBARA SOBEL 

T HE FIRST TWO floors of Tenaya Hall have been turned into Muir College's 
second theme house, the Cultural 
House. Like Muir's Wilderness 
House and Revelle's Language 
House, the Cultural House is a 
form of standard university 
housing, not co-operative 
housing. According to Louie 
Kronopolis, Muir College 
Assistant Resident Dean, Muir 
decided to implement the 
Cultural House idea as a Wa)1 to 
expand residential life and to 
develop an appreciation of 
culture among Muir students. 

The Cultural House held a 
Greek culture evening on 
Sunday. KtOnopohs led a 
discussion on Greek history and 
va lues, and taught the group a 
bit of Greek vocabulary. 

In February 1985 a 
subcommIttee of the Student 
Affirmative Action Committee 
(SAAC) met to evaluate the 
feaSibility of a Cultural House at 
UCSD. UCLA, UCSB and 
Stanford aU have similar houses 
based on the same general 
prinCiples. The subcommittee 
outlined the objeCtIves of the 
house and met with the ReSident 
Deans of the four colleges. Muir 
was the only college that 
Immediately accepted the 
program. At 'the time Muir was 
looking for an idea for a new 
theme house. 

Cultural House is a Joint effort 
of SAAC and MUIr College. 
Rasheeda Pasha, SAAC 
Residential Life Intern , acts a an 
intermediary between $Me. the 
Cultural House, and the MUIr 
administration. Pasha IS an 
advisor who raises Issues that 
need to be discussed by both 
SAAC and the Muir 
admmlstration . "Rasheeda keeps 
track of what's going on, and 
reports it to SMC SMC keeps 
an eye on It and recommends 
actions," said Wade Wofford , 
Cultural House resident and 
member of SMC SMC plays a 
major role in programming for 
the Cultural House , according to 
Wofford . 

"The Cultural House at Muir is 
a pilot project," said Denise 
Miura , MC Executive Intern of

External Affairs he believes that 
If the house works well , the other 
colleges will implement their own 
Cultural Houses. 

Monte Broad cd , Warren 
College Assistant Resident Dean, 
said the idea is one that all the 
colleges suppOrt in principle, hut 
one thar they have reservations 
about operating. "It is a hot issue 
for us. We are waiting to see the 
good and bad pOints," said 
Yolanda Trevino, Third College 
Resident Dean. She satd Third 
College will evaluate the program 
at the end of winter quarter. 
Both Warren and Third Colleges 
are wat hing the progress of 
Muir's Cultural House with the 
idea that a similar program 
might be adopted in the future 
to fit the needs of the individual 
colleges. 

One of the concerns 
administrators felt about the 
Cultural House was that it would 
promote segregation. The ethnic 
mix of Cultural House 
partiCIpants was a concern, 
Trevino said. According to Nadir 
Haqq, SMC Executive Intern, 
Internal Affairs, "the Cultural 
House IS a drive for dlversiry. It 
IS not intended for segregation ." 
He hopes that people from as 
many different backgrounds as 
pOSSible will participate 
"Different cultures have a 
untfying effect. You learn what 
makes a person tick, talking 
about his cul ture ," Haqq added . 

The opportunir), to participate 
111 the Cultural House was 
presented to Mutr continuing 
students last spring and to 
freshmen at their orientation. 
Some residenrs were put 111 the 
house because of their Interests, 
Kronopolis said . Felicia Filip, a 
Cultural House resident, said she 
did not hear about the house at 
her orientation, but thinks she 
was put in because of the 
extensive traveling she has done 
and her expressed interest in 
culture. 

Cultural House residents feel 
they are getting a new 
perspective on the world. 
something extra by living in the 
house . "A wonderful support 
system is being built because of

AS votes on C'IA at ASIO 
By Karin Jacobsen" ScajJ WnCer 

As PRE IDENT Mary Rose Alexander introduced a resolutlon to ban CIA 
internships offered by the 
Associated Students Internsh ip 
Organization (ASIO) at an AS 
Council meeting Wednesday. 

until last week's counCi l meeting 
when a Guardian reponer, 
follow1l1g up on a student 
compla1l1t, asked why the ASIO 
was sponsori ng the CIA. "At that 
lime, it was too late to draw up a 
resolution . 

"We are nor recrumng for the 
CIA ," Einwohner said . 

Einwohner said she did not 
know how the CIA internship 
originated. but conjectures thar 
the CIA approached the ASIO , 
saying they could provide a 
valuable learning experience for 
the student. 

The CIA internship has been 
available since 1981 and was 
renewed in December 1985 
befole resolution #2 was passed. 
A cording to Einwohner, "In the 

five years the Internship has 
heen here, no student has ever 
expressed an 1I1rerest 111 it." 

AnOther ASIO representative , 
who was responsible for the Oyer 
said "We didn't decide to 
advertise the CIA internship 
specifically. We look at which 
kinds of internships are popular 
with the students, and try to 
highlight those. Washington , 
D.C. II1ternshlps are currently 
very popular, and we offer 
between 200-300 Internships 

there . I listed the CIA as one of 
thes& internships not realizing 
that it would be such a big deal." 

If the AS decides that the ASIO 
internship constitutes indirect 
endorsement of the CIA, they 
will recommend that the ASIO 
drop rhe 1I1ternshlp. According 
to Alexander, " ow that they (the 
ASIO) understand the Issue, I 
think they are willing to not have 
the internship. This issue got 
made our of something that was 
not a big Issue. ~ 

The new legislation lollows 
controversy over a recent ASIO 
Oyer listing the CIA as one of its 
Washington , D.C. summer 
internships. In tbe AS elections 
last spring, a substantial majority 
of students passed resolution #2 
(Yes-I 580, No-843), which stated 
that student registration fees 
would not be used to suppOrt 
on-campus recruitment by either 
the CIA, FBI , INS, Secret Service 
or military. 

"The ASIO is a Vi rtually 
mdependent and autonomous 
organization, with its own 
leaders The AS does not take 
any actlons on their day to day 
activities," Alexander said . 
However, because the ASIO is 
partially subsidized by the 
ASUCSD with student activity 
fees, the AS is drawing up a 
resolution to ask the ASIO to 
withdraw the CIA internship, 
Alexander said. 

UCSD campaigners calling 
According to Alexander, 

resolution #2 was initiated by 
the ProgreSSive Student Alliance 
to target on-campus recruitment 
through Career Services. "I don't 
think the ASIO was aware that 
the resolution applied to them 
too ," Alexander said. 'The ASIO 
is a non-political organization; 
their sole purpose is to provide 
an internship service to the 
students." Alexander said that 
"Washington internships are very 
popular and I think the ASIO 
was unaware that listing the CIA 
internship would have any 
political repercussions. It was an 
oversight; they either didn't 
know about or didn 't remember 
the referendum." 

Alexander said that the AS did 
not know about the ASIO OyerS 

Alexander pointed OUt that 
although resolution # 2 passed 
last spring was "only a 
recommendation and not a law," 
it reOected student feeling 
against CIA recruitment on 
campus. 

"There is a fine line between 
recruitment and endorsement," 
Alexander said. She said that the 
AS Council will decide whether 
the CIA internships constitute 
recruitment by the CIA. "I would 
have to say that the CIA 
internship is probably indirectly 
an endorsement of the CIA," 
commented Alexander. 

ASIO director Rena E1I1wohner 
said the ASIO is torally 
unaffiliated with any (political) 
group and offers internships 
with a wide variety of different 
political organizations.

A TELEMARKETING fund -raising ca~paign was launched October 7 by 
the UCSD 25th Anniversary 
Fund-Raising Campaign in order 
to raise $2,000,000 by June 30 
for a student center. 

Parents and alumni are the 
focus of this particular fund-
raising effort. They are being 
contacted by telephone by 
students hired to help with the 
campaign. Those contacted are 
asked 10 pledge from $100 a year 
for three years 10 $1 ,000 a year 
for three years. 

"We are calling people who 
have an interest in the 
university. UCSD is growing, its 
status is increasing and we're 
here to help it continue. The 

parents have an investment in 
the UI1lVerslty and they want 
their child's degree to mean 
something. The alumni's degree 
will mean more also ," said Lisa 
Osborn, program director for the 
fund-raisi ng campaign. 

According to Osbom , 
approximately $90,000 has been 
raised so far this quarter while 
$200,000 is the goal hoped to be 
reached by December. 

According to Ray Ramseyer. 
special assistant to the 
Chancellor and directOr of the 
25th Anniversary Campaign, over 
2,000 parents have made pledges 
so far and approximately 
$850,000 has been raised , from 
la t year's campaign and that 
generatt;d so far this year, 
combmed. 

The parents being contacted 
now are those who were 
contacted last year in a Similar 
campaign that lasted from 
February to May, according to 
Osborn , but who did 'not make 
pledges at that time. 

Students were hired to 
telephone the parents and 
alumni because "rhey know the 
most about the university and 
they too (like the parents and 
alumni) have an investment in 
it," according to Osborn. 

"We hire pro-student center 
students with enthusiasm. This 
will carry over to the. people we 
speak to," Osborn said.

Into the Summit with bleak hopes 
One thing we can be sure of in the up oming Geneva summit 

between the United States and the Soviet Union is that both leaders, 
Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev, will be playing to a crowd of 
upwards of four billion people. This mass of humanity has waited 
patiently for nearly 40 years for the two superpowers to reach an 
agreement on how to "unterrorize" the planet. The gross and 
unnecessary stockpile of nuclear weapons accumulated by both nations 
since the second World War has overwhelmed us all, and the time has 
come to dismantle the premise that they are constructed upon - that a 
Single country can achieve the goal of global superiority. 

After" - living in a pia-net-wide Hiroshima scenario, or not existing at 
all . 

Starting from a rational , forego ne conclusion that no ideology should 
superimpose its aspirations on the prospe t of peace that thereby 
produces a violent international climate, one would think that 
politicians would simply drop the practice of blindly accusing one 
another of being evil in order to truly support the ir own rhetorical 
flourishes about their sincerity in creating global cooperation. 

uclear weaponry has become a shield against international 
accountability as citizens of the world are merely satisfied with the 
temporal nature of nuclear detente rather than severely questioning the 
imperialistiC wanderings of both nations. For the people of this world 
are now pawns to the greatest destructive force in the history of our 
being; we simply do not want to antagonize either superpower enough 
to motivate a crooked finger pushing a bulton , potentially wiping out a 
species that is not yet ready to die, 

We say to Ronald and Mikhail. "Excuse us , gentlemen , but we would 
like to inte~ect something before you end the summit with just a few 
symbolic gestures. We only wanted to tell you that the game has gone 
toO far , the sun is sinking faster, the tides are rising higher. Imagine if 
you could both sit down together and decide to dismantle all the 
nuclear weapons that are in your possession. Look, your public images 
would get such an international boost that you might remain in office 
even into the 21st century! You fellows could call up Deng in China, 
Maggie in England, Francois in France, Zia in Pakistan, Ghandi in India 
and a few more of the potential world destructors, and convince them, 
too, of the futility and ludicrousness of nuclear armaments. Then we 
could all get back to the business of being stable human beings again. 
What do you say?" 

Pervading the atmosphere above Switzerland is the fate of humanity. 

Looking yonder th rough the daily pages of summit discussion and 
analysis, it seems everyone is partiCipating in the numbers game. We 
think that it must be something of a generational flaw, that the concept 
of ageism has finally chilled us to the bones - we , the second 
generation of nuclear-age children cannot grasp to logic of nuclear 
tradeoffs. Offensive , defensive , strategic, land-based , sea-based , air-based 
- hell , even mind-based - nuclear weapons are to be bartered like old 
pieces of furniture . For what purpose? We have never felt secure under 
a nuclear umbrella; in fact, if one is morosely reminiscent, our whole co-
existence wlth these man-eaters has been a living nightmare. One may 
pretend not to think about these missiles and lasers each day, but we all 
have that one , terri fying memory of our first conception of the "Day 

If the twO superpowers do not reach an accord that will guarantee rapid 
reductions in nuclear capability, one cannot hope to trust either of them 
in their convictions that their specific ideology is morally correct, or in 
their promises that they do not seek global dominance. The agenda 
items proposed by the Reagan Administration, such as a discussion of 
human rights violations and regional conflicts, cannot be properly 
addressed by either side if the nuclear power struggle goes on much 
longer. Those nations that suffer under imperialistic greed built on a 
nuclear domain have virtually no chance at salvation (i.e. Poland , Chile, 
Czechoslovakia, Guatemala, Hungary, the Phillipines and so on into 
eternity) if the superpowers refuse to negotiate on the most inhumane , 
pressing item. All of our heart-wrenching problems: poverty, starvation , 
malnutrition , oppression, racism, sexism, totalitarianism, ageism, 
overpopulation , environmental abuse and the like, are worthy of serious 
global consideration. The almighty chess game has stalemated on the 
1986th move - humanity has no moves left to capture the king of 
secular superiority. Let the United States and the Soviet Union put their 
chessboards back on the shelf. Let us extend our hand in reconciliation 
and trust. Let us live in a nuclear-free world forever more.

An AS response 
Editor: 

I am writing in an attempt to 
give the UCSD student body an 
accurate account of the issues 
that are discussed at AS Council 
meetings and to clear up the 
construed controversy over 
resolutlon it 2 on last year's 
spring election ballot. 

Firstly, the article written by 
Tina Rich titled "Our Far Rung 
Reporter's visit with the AS," was, 
I believe , an attempt to cover the 
AS meetng on October 30 «(wo 
weeks ago). At that meeting, the 
AS discussed many pertinent 
issues not even so much as 
mentioned by Ms. Rich nor the 
Guardian . For example , we 
debated and passed financial by-
law amendments and an entirely 
new set of Constitutional by-
laws. Both documents were 
elabora te and vital to the 
functioning of your AS Council. 
In addition, we discussed the 
25th Anniversary, the Lobby 
Annex, a Programming Idea 
contest and the AS Cafe. 

Also not mentioned by this 
article , or by the Guardian , are a 
variety of prOjects that the AS is 
working on and has discussed at 
thelf meetings. These include: 
Alcohol Education (notice the 
new class offered next quarter); a 
new posting service with 16 
brand new kiosks coming next 
quarter, plans for the University 
Center: attempting to change the 
'drop Without a 'W " deadline 

from 4th to 6th week of the 
quarter; a students' nghts 
handbook; alternative housing, a 
"Tipsy Taxi Service", the 
Chancel!or" Leadership 
TranSCript Program; a new 
Commuter Ride Board; speakers' 
forum; increased library hours 
(has anyone noticed that HL IS 
now open untll 2 am on 
weeknights?) All of these projects 
are beginning to be worked on at 
this ve l} moment; I question why 
the Guardian hasn't chosen to 
look into these issues. 

Why is it that the Guardian 
chooses instead to cover certain 
aspects of the AS meeting which. 
by the way, were only 
announcements? Yes, I don 't 
deny that we dIscussed the Idea 
of entering a student float in the 
La Jolla Town Council Parade 
and to begin attending their 
meetings. Nor do I deny t"<it one 
council member menti011ed the 
idea of opening a UCSD 
"paraphernalia" shop to include 
both Greek and UCSD items 
(where else can you by a UCSD 
shirt on campus without being 
over-charged by the bookstore?) 
Both of these items were 
discussed two weeks ago , but I 
stress they certai nly were not at 
the heart of the meeting. 

Why does the Guardian 
choose to give students such 
distorted facts about their AS 
Council? Why is the Guardian 
more concerned about making 
an Issue out of an Hem which we 

haven't even had a chance to 
confront: The fact that ASIO 
advertised summer internships 
with the Central Intelligence 
Agency? Here are the facts: The 
referendum was passed last 
spring against the CIA 
recruitment on campus by Career 
Planning and Placement and the 
referendum was endorsed by the 
newly-elected council. Last 
Wednesday, (the day of our last 
meeting) the AS Internship 
Office, a service of the AS, 
announced that it would be 
offering internships with the 
CIA. That same night, Dennis 
Woo, a Guardian writer, came to 
the AS meeting to ask why th is 
internship was being allowed in 
hght of the referendum - thiS 
was the first time I was aware of 
the ASIa 's internship. At that 
time, I mentioned that we would 
look into it and that the ASIO is 
semi-autonomous from the AS in 
its da y-to-day operations. Since 
then , it has been debated 
whether by providing an 
internship, ASIO is directly 
contributing to the CIA's 
recruitment on campus; this is a 
fine line. I believe that the ASIa 
should not provide these 
internships because of student 
referendum; ASIO further 
understands this now that the 
referendum has been brought to 
their attention. It was an 
Innocent mistake on behalf of 
ASIO and it will be corrected by 
the AS Concll . I have submitted 

legislation as New Business, and 
it will be voted on by the AS 
Council on Wednesday, 
November 20 at its weekly 
meeting. This legislation was 
drafted and the issue dealt with , 
long before Mr. Cronin's threat of 
a "new election." 

I hope this letter will clear up 
the confusion caused by the 
Guardian's lack of accurate 
coverage of AS events and 
meetings. Lastly, I would like to 
nOte that Mr. Cronin does not 
even attend AS meetings and did 
not speak to myself, or any AS 
Council members or the ASIa 
staff. How then, can he 
accurately base his opinions?

Editor: 

In response to Mr. Cronin's 
editorial in the last issue of the 
Guardian, I'd like to suggest that 
you were out of line . Although 
you may have registered some 
valid complainrs concerning 
political apathy on campus, I feel 
that only those were legitimate 
and your ire and indignation 
should have been restricted to 
the AS or the student body at 
large . The AS Internship Office 
should not have drawn your fire 
although your liberal imaginings 
may have lead you to believe that 
ASIO fired the first shot. It 
should nOl even have been used 
as the springboard from which 
to launch your attack against the 
AS. 

I understand your position 
against the conception of a 
student referendum as adVISOry 
rather than resolute . I realize that 
this seems, and may in fact be , 
unfair and render the, entire 
process unnecessary. Why bother 
to care about an issue enough to 
voice your decision when it can 
be overrided or disregarded 
anyway? In asking this question 
you raised an Impornmt point

The Door of Opportunity Creaks Open 
By SANFORD LAKOFF 

The new arms-control 
proposals of Soviet leader 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev and 
President Reagan , both calling for 
a 50 percent reduction in 
strategic nuclear warheads, leave 
important diagreements 
unresolved but bring the 
superpopwers closer to a major 
agreement. In place of a window 
of vulnerability, a door of 
opportunity has been opened, 
and the twO leaders would be 
tempting fate if they did not 
begin to walk toward it at their 
forthcoming summit meeting. 

Soviet ICBM warheads would 
eliminate such fears - and with 
them the case for the MX. 

Although an acceptance of 
either ceiling would leave the 
Soviets with an advantage in the 
land-based leg of the strategic 
triad, this advantage could no 
longer be claimed to be militarily 
significant. The United States, 
moreover, would continue to 
enjoy offsetting advantages in the 
other two legs of the triad 
because of our superiority in 
submarine-launched missles and 
long-range aircraft carrying 
bombs, penetration aids and 
cruise missles. 

would keep the 243 SS-20s now 
deployed, while we would be 
allowed 143 Single-warhead 
cruise missiles but no Pershing 
2s. 

launcers, but may be willing to 
limit the number rn exchange for 
US willingness to limit its 
deployment of the new, highly 
accurate D-5 submarine-launched 
missiles. 

strategic threat but as a way of 
protecting mankind , he should 
be willing to agree to limits on 
testing that would remain in 
force until the preliminary work 
shows sufficient promise to 
warrant either renegotiation of or 
if necessary, abrogation of the 
ABM treaty. 

The exact terms of the two 
propsals are still officially secret, 
but enough details have been 
leaked to make outlines of a 
compromise package more than 
dimly discernible. 

In the crucial matter of 
intercontinental ballistic missle 
warheads, the gap between the 
earlier bargaining stances has 
been narrowed dramatically - to 
a difference of 3,600 proposed 
by the Soviets and 3,000 
proposed by the US. Either way, 
the Soviets would be obliged to 
dismantle a substantial number 
of their approximately 6,500 
ICBM warheads. It was the 
lopsided imbalance between this 
arsenal and the roughly 2,000 
warheads in ours that gave rise 
to fears of a Soviet pre-emptive 
strike and to a politically 
unsuccessful effort to diminish 
the risk by deploying MX 
missles. A sharp cutback in 

With respect to intennediate-
range weapons, which have 
caused anxiety in Europe. the 
gap has also been narrowed, 
although less dramatically. 
Instead of insisting on a "zero-
zero" formula , the United States 
now propses equal 
emplacements: the 140 
Tomahawk cruise missile 
launchers and Pershing 2 
ballistic missle launchers 
scheduled to be installed by the 
end of this year against an 
identical number of Soviet 55-20 
ballistic missle launchers. The 
Soviets, who previously 
demanded that we dismantle all 
of our weapons while they 
retained as many SS-20's as 
needed to offset French and 
British forces , :lOW reportedly 
propose a somewhat more 
accommodating formula . They

Hail to: UCSD Summer Session, Q-028 
University of california. San Dlego/1.1 Jolla, CA 92093, 

A compromise would probably 
resemble the trial balloon floated 
by Ambassadors Paul Nitze and 
Yuli Kvitsinsky during their 
celebrated "walk in the woods" 
in 1982, which was promptly 
shOl down from both 
Washington and Moscow. That 
proposal called for the United 
States to deploy 75 Tomahawk 
launchers (each with four single-
warhead missiles) and the 
Soviets to retain 75 5S-20s (each 
with three warheads). If this 
balloon were reinflated , it might 
just be allowed to fly. 

A new and suprising 
complication introduced by . 
Reagan - suprising because It 
runs counter to the 
recommendations of his own 
Commission on Startegic Forces 
- calls for both sides to forgo 
deployment of mobile misslles. 
This is likely to meet stiff SOVIet 
opposition, but even this ~i~kle 
miRht be ironed out. The mlhtary 
heads of the Soviet StrategiC 
Rocket Force probably agreed to) 
a drastic cutback in ICBM 
warheads because they were 
already planning to pnase out 
many of their heavier fixed 
launchers in favor of less 
vulnerable but lighter mobile 
missiles carrying few warheads. 
They are therefore unlikely to 
agree to a total ban on mobile 

Last but hardly least, there is 
the problem posed by the . 
StrategiC Defense Initiative. Sovtet 
spokesmen in Geneva warned 
that there can be no agreement 
on arms reduction unless the 
United States renounces its 
intended development of "space 
strike weapons." They are careful; 
however, nOl to denounce all 
defensive efforts. The obvious 
reason is that they have already 
made heavy investment in 
defenses. More than half the 
mega tonnage in the American 
strategic mix is carried in our 
bomber fleet, and is therefore 
vulnerable to the thick Soviet 
ami-aircraft screen as well as to 
the recently upgraded ABM 
around Moscow. The Soviets also 
have under wayan undeclared 
SOl of their own, aimed at 
developing other forms of 
ballistic missile defenses -
including lasers that might be 
deployed on the ground or in 
space. . 

There is enough commonahty 
of interest in this issue to allow 
for compromise. Both sides agree 
that "research" on defensive 
systems is not forbidden by the 
1983 ABM treaty. If Reagan is 
serious about wanting to assure 
the Russians (a nd our allies) that 
the SOl is intended not as a 

Indeed, once a treaty is 
hammered out at the arms-
control talks in Geneva, it will 
become apparent that funher ~ 
progress may well require the 
deployment of effective defenses. 
Otherwise , neither side WlII be 
willing to risk still deeper cutS in 
its strategiC deterrent force. But if 
there is no agreement now, both 
sides will become committed to a 
no-holds-barred offensive and 
defensive anns race that will 
virtually preclude more 
comprehensive reductions. 
Successful negotiations will also 
relieve political tensions in 
Western Europe. reduce pressure 
on the US budget, and offer 
Gorbachjev the chance to enlist 
the cooperation of the West in 
his campaign to lift the Soviet 
economy out of the Stone Age. 
For all these reasons, both 
leaders should not allow this 
door of oportunity to slam shut 
without making every effort to 
take advantage of it.

regarding the responsiveness and 
responsibility of the AS vis a vis 
the students themselves, 
However, you should have 
stopped there because the recent 
publicity flyer put out by the 
ASIa is not a case exemplary of 
your point. The AS[O broke no 
rules when it agreed to provide 
an opporrunity for students to 
intern with the Central 
Intelligence Agency and the AS 
did not go against student 
wishes when it did nothing to 
deny this opportuniry. 

It is unfortunate that the 
mention of the CIA causes an 
almost rabid reaction with some, 
but there is still no law against 
mentioning it. There is also no 
law against worki ng for the 
agency if one should decide to 
do so. But there is an unwritten 
law brought into existence by a 
measured consensus among 
students that the CIA should not 
be allowed to recruit on campus. 
Fine. Maybe everyone should 
respect that. So now the question 
is this: [s the CIA actively 
recruiting when it is merely 
advertised on a flyer as one of 
the literally hundreds of 
possibilities that a prospective 
intern, follOwing his own 
interests, may choose? That 
seems like reaching to me but I'll 
assume for now that it is indeed 
active recruitment. Now what 
happens if a student is 
interested in interning with the 
CIA for very good reasons of his 
own? Should he be denied the 
opportunity, where it could exist 
(namely at a university where 
opportunity should abound), to 
pursue his Interest if his PUrsUlt 

I in no way affects his fellow 
students? [s it right that he be 
denied , by a student referendum 
or any other means? , say It is 
not. Maybe that is why a student 
referendum is adVlsory and not 
mandatory. 

Now suspending my previous 
assumption, it seems to me that 
the CIA is not recruiting through 
the ASia . The CIA does not 
come to individuals in this case 
so much as it lets individuals 
seek the agency. [t is simply one 
of the many corporate and 
political organizations that is 
willing to take on srudents as 
volunteers. [n return for their 
time, students are given 
experience and exposure in their 
field of interest outside a 
classroom environment. The 
argument over whether the CIA 
is wrong in notion or immoral in 
practice is a heated one with, I 
belie\'e, sides of close to equal 
merit. Certainly there are 
individuals who may want to 
intern with the CIA for what 
might be quite valid reasons, 
though they may be ideologically 
different from yours. You should 
respect their freedom of thought 
and choice (i n true liberal 
tradition) and even thank the 
ASIa for maintaining a Wide 
range of selctions to suit people 
other than yourself.

students would make between 
$5.50 and $8 an hour, the 
guaranteed pay is $4.25 an hour. 
"Bonuses" referred to in the ad 
constitute any payment above 
and beyond the base rate . 

Bonuses are offered to 
stUd ents who earn the most 
pledges in a nigh t or who have 
the highest average by the end of 
a three to four hour long session, 
according to Ramseyer. There are 
a variety of other incentives that 
are also used so students will 
have the chance to earn these 
bonuses, Ramseyer said. 

"I don't get my hopes up 
(about the bonuses). I get 
bummed out when [ don't make 
it. It's good enough to get the 
regular wage but, if , get more, 
then great," said Greg Felix, an 
electrical engineer major and 
telephone operator for the 
campaign. 

"It's hard to ask people for 
money. It's hard to put myself in 
the positIon of asking for it 
when I think about how I would 
feel if I were the one being called 
and asked. I don't believe in it 
strongly enough to trick myself 
into being an aggressive caller," 
said Felix. 

'" find it stressful , but I like it," 
said Karen Yeakley, a 
communications major working 
as a caller. "There are good and 
bad days. I took the job because 
being a communications major, I 

thought it would give me 
experience in tne field : It can 
be rewarding as well. "One man 
who was not interested in 
contributing ended up pledging 
$500 after' talked to him ." 

The students who do the best, 
who receive the most pledges are 
those "who don't mind asking 
people for money," Osborn said . 
Osborn also said that many 
students find out quickly that 
this job isn't for them "because 
they are unable to do this at aiL" 

"It's a difficult job," said 
Ramseyer, "First of all a high 
percentage of those contacted by 
phone aren't home. Second , 
there are more people with 
reasons not to contribute than 
those with reasons to contribute. 
Satisfaction comes from success, 
so it can sometimes be 
frustrating work: 

Construction for the 
University Center Will begin next 
fall . It will house a theater for 
films and lectures, meeting 
rooms, offices for student 
organizations, areas for 
recreation and relaxation , a 
bookstore, information facility 
and food concession areas. 

The total cost for the 
University center will be 
approximately $14 or $15 
million , according to Ramseyer. 
Part of that will be paid through 
an increase in student fees and 
part will come in the form of 
rent from facilities housed within 
the center. The students will

probably begin to pay for the 
student union at the start of 
construction , Ramseyer said . 

"We are hampered by not 
having an adequate student 
center. There is an important 
need to enhance the sense of 
community on campus," said 
Ramseyer. 

The telemarketing campaign is 
but one phase of the 25th 
Anniversary Fund·Raising 
Campaign which encompasses it. 
The goal for all the phases of 
this campaign is $30.4 million to 
be reached by the end of 
December, 1986. 

The other fund·raising phases 
include donations from 
corporations, friends of the 
university, and faculty and staff, 
said Ramseyer. No parents or 
alumni will be contak:ted for 
donations in areas other than 
the student center. 

A total of ')USt under $13 
million" has been reached so far 
in the combination of all phases 
of the campaign. This money Will 
go to the development of 
programs that are "marks of a 
great university," said Ramseyer. 

A few of the programs that are 
beIng planned include a 
humanities institute, an Increase 
of library special collections, 
Pacific Basin studies, Institute for 
Research on Aging, a cancer 
center research facility , an 
aquarium and ocean sCience 
center and an outdoor 
amphitheatre. 

According to Ramseyer, 
approximately 15% of the total 
amount earned through the 
telemarketing campaign will go 
to the expenses of running it. 
The costs include the phone 
bills , personnel and the "minor" 
cost of supplies. ~

UCSD comments on Geneva talks 
By JOHN C. TOMAN and MARGOT GERBER 

AlIr" Greb, IGCC aSSISlane dim tor 

UC influences talks 
In addition to his job as a 

professor at UCSD, Allen Greb 
is assistant director of the 
Institute on Global Conflict and 
Cooperation ((GCC). Greb 
believes that professors' influence 
on the summit is limited, 
although "several of us know 
people who have contacts in 
Washington , DC; several IGCC 
members, for example , including 
myself." 

Greb descnbes IGee as "a 
systemwide new institute" whose 
purpose is [Q "increase the 
number of people who are 

York has 
reselVations 

actively engaged in research and 
teaching about ways to avoid 
large-scale intemational conflict." 
IGCe's headquarters are at 
UCSD, but it is active on all nine 
UC campuses, 

Greb thinks that as a teacher 
he must create awareness in 
students and give them a 
broader background in 
international relations so that 
they can influence events like 
the Geneva summit. "The 
ultimate thing they can do is 
learn more about the issues. 

"The UniverSity of California 

is in a neat position (to 
influence the talks) since it 
operates or manages the two 
nuclear weapons laboratories for 
the Department of Energy." Greb 
actually sees political awareness 
emerging within the university. 
"The UC system is starting to be 
recognized as a source of 
information about issues such as 
the summit. It's actually 
beginning to work." 

According to Greb, there are 
two major reasons why Reagan 
has waited so long to go to the 
bargaining table. First, "He didn't 
know exactly who he was 
dealing with." Soviet leaders have 
come and gone, but now there 
seems to be a growing stability in 
Gorbachev. Secondly, "Reagan 
came into office with the notion 
that the United States was 
strategically inferior to the Soviet 
Union." Therefore, he thinks 
Reagan had to build the nation's 
defenses before entering into 
negotiations. 

As for the talks themselves, 
Greb harbors reserved optimism. 
He sees any major agreement as 
the result of a long process. 
"Probably all that's going to come 
OUt of this summit is the 
agreement to have another 
summit." 1m 

Herbert York, UCSD political 
scll~nce professor, and statewide 
director of the Institute on Global 
ConflICt and Cooperation (IGeC). 
belreve that not very much will 
come of the Geneva talks since 
the situation is charged "with 
purely political questions. It 's 
hard to figure out what will 
happen at the talks, thlnkmg 
only about the issues." 

Herb Yarn, IGCC d,rector and polrtical science professor 

What he does feel will occur 
during this meeting is the 
arrangement of future talks, and 
the identification of mutual 
interests and guidelines that 
should be pursued at later 
negotiations meetings. 
York comments that the 
character of these conferences 
will be interesting because 
Gorbachev is a new and a 
younger leader with a different 

personality than his 
predecessors . 

On the subject of what 
students can do to influence 
these talks. York says that the 
correct way to look at the role of 
students, is that they are 
preparing themselves through 
their education for their future 
roles in society, His theory is 
that students leam from 
watching what is going on in the 
world , and that they can apply 

US, USSR: 'compromise' 
The spirit of compromise is an 

important thing that UCSD 
political science major Kyle 
Knapp doesn 't believe Reagan 
has. He thinks the leaders of 
both the United States and the 
U.S,S.R. are too stubborn to come 
to any agreement at the Geneva 
summit. 

"I'm not overly optimistic 
because the Reagan 
Administration now, as I see it, 
is ... mainly hard liners, and they 
don't seem to have any spirit 
towards compromise. I think we 
need to push the Reagan 
Administration towards a more 
flexible position." 

Knapp doesn't think Reagan is 
willing to bargain over "Star 
Wars" or the arms build-up. "He 
doesn 't seem like he's in a mood 
to sit down and talk." 

"I would say now IS a pretty 
decent time for Reagan" to go to 
a summit. Knapp thinks Reagan 
wants to take some pressure off 
his domestic programs, 
particularly his tax plans. Also, 
"He's getting tons of press over 
this (the Summit) and that's 
going to improve his image." 

The Russians, Knapp says, are 
"now more than ever in a spirit 
of compromise. They're terrifred 

Pleast tum to page 9 

this absorbed knowledge later, 
when they become leaders, 
public policy makers and 
concerned citizens of their 
generation . 

York says , "If this sounds 
paternalistic, that is because it 
is." He believes that university 
professors have the task of 
aiding this learning process, in 
order to prepare students "10 
play their proper role in the 
future ." 

Kyle Knapp, pollllcal 
sCIence major 

Gerald Steinberx, UCSD political 
science professor 

Summit: 
'a big show' 

Gerald Steinberg, visiting 
assistant political science 
professor at UC5D, and research 
fellow at the Institute on Global 
Conflict and Cooperation 
((GCC), teaches a class on 
international relations this 
quarter. He feels that an 
important function of this 
course, and of faculty members 
who teach politically oriented 
material, is to help students 
separate different aspects of 
political process from the 
rhetoric. Steinberg says that, 
although his class doesn't deal 
directly with the Geneva talks, it 
is necessary for students to learn 
how to PUt events into a 

histOrical perspective in order to 
understand the role of 
negotiations in political history. 

Referring to his own 
knowledge of negotiation 
meetings, Steinberg commented 
that he expect the summit talks 
to accomplish very little. He says 
that in the past these talks have 
not really changed anything, 
since usually the agreements are 
worked Out in advance, and only 
announced at summits. 

"There is a lot of media 
distortion (of the event)," says 
Steinberg. It is an opportunity for 
the leaders 10 get 10 know each 
other, but ',it has almost no 
impact on international 
relations." He cite-s as an 
example the Kennedy and 
Krushchev talks in 1963, which 
actually hindered efforts 10 
relieve world tensions more than 
they helped, since the two men 
experienced a personality clash. 
He notes that shortly after these 
"peace talks" came the Cuban 
Missile Crisis and the Berlin 
Crisis. 

Steinberg looks upon the talks 
as a "big show," during which 
political leaders get media 
exposure , so that "the media and 
politicians work together to 
further each other's interests," 
However, he feels that "the fact 
that the summit is taking place is 
the most important thing" 
because it "signals or 
acknowledges that there is a 
renewed chance for some U.5.-
Soviet cooperation ." 1m 

SCO/l Foust , political science major 

Wait, Mr. President 
UCSD political science major 

SCOtt Foust tries to take an 
objective viewpoint on the 
Geneva summit. He isn't 
particularly impressed with either 
Reagan or Gorbachev, or with 
the summit meeting as a whole , 
but he does think some kind of 
agreement will eventually emerge 
from the summit. 

"I don't think a whole lot as far 
as major agreements is going to 
come out of this summit 
meeting, Even in the laSt week or 
so the sides are still far apart. 
They can't even agree on a 
statement. let alone major issues." 

But Foust does think that the 
atmosphere for the arms control 
talks "in the near future would be 
good if they could only, at this 
summit, come up with '" 
guidelines," Foust thinks the best 
time for talks will be six months 
to a year from now, "because 
Gorbachev will have secured 
himself in the hierarchy of the 
U,S,S.R" 

According to Foust, "There's 
been some egg on Reagan 's face," 
especially concerning the recent 
Soviet sailor incident, "I think 
Reagan has to go to the summit 
looking tough to appease his 
hard-line backing. 

"I believe there are going to be 
several rallies around the nation 
in support of President Reagan." 
Through these demonstrations, 
"Reagan would he all the more 
encouraged" 10 get something 
done at the summil." 

As for Gorbachev, Foust says, 
"He's very smooth," But he 
thinks Gorbachev will be "a 
standard, Politburo-type leader. I 
don't think he's gong to ". come 
up with anything radicaUy 
different." He believes that once 
Gorbachev concentrates Soviet 
power, there's going to be a 
different policy. Scott says, "It 
has been to Reagan 's advantage 
to wait." But it's clear he thinks 
that the President should have 

~)fed a little o~~e;.. ,r ~ I I~' 

'compromise' 
Continued from page 8 
of 'Star Wars ,' the Russian 
economy is in bad shape and 
they spend way 100 much on 
their defense ." 

Knapp believes the Russians 
should Cut their defense 
spending and concentrate on 
domestic spending, but "they've 
got to create somethimt against 
our 'Star Wars.' " He adds that the 
Russians are tOO stubborn also. 
regarding arms control. 

Knapp thinks that both stdes 
need "more technical advisers 
and sClentlfrc people" because 
the issues of the summit are so 
sens itive. "Up until a couple of 
years ago Reagan still thought a 
nuclear war was winnable. I 
honestly don 't think politicians 
and the people who are Reagan 's 
advisors are knowledgeable 
enough." ~ 

Reagan: 
too tough 

Beth Ledinson, a UCSD 
political science major doesn't 
believe Reagan has pursued the 
right policy in going to the 
bargaining table in a pOSition of 
political strength. She thinks it's 
good that he's finally willing to 
talk, but she feels Reagan's 
position intimidates the Soviets 
so that there is less chance of a 
significant agreement. 

"I think (we) should question 
Reagan more. And question what 
he really wants 10 do. And 
question it from the point of 
view of a Soviet." She believes 
students should actively protest 
and demonstrate against his 
policies, to PUt pressure on him 
to come to some kind of 
agreement with the Soviets. 

Chief in Beth's mind is the 
StrategiC Defense Initiative ("Star 
Wars"), which she thinks has 
intimidated the Soviets so 
that they are now less likely 10 
agree 10 any sort of arms 
reduction . 

"Reagan is not being entirely 
truthful about what his real aims 
are. He doesn't want to talk 
about Latin America, but he 
wantS to talk about Mghanistan. 
So he's trying 10 make the Soviet 
Union look really bad with 
Mghanistan," 

According to Ledinson, 
bargaining from a position of 
strength is "misleading. I think 
that's the wrong way to go into a 
negotiation. You should go in 
feeling that you have something 
that you can work with as equals. 
I think it's going to put the 
Soviet Union on the defensive ." 

As for the outcome of the 
talks , Ledinson says, "Maybe 
they'll better understand what 
their problems are , 'j'hey'll be in 
agreement on what they disagree 
on." However, she thinks 
that neither of the sides "reallY

Polo mallets opponents 
By DAVID TEDROW, Staff Wnter 

T HE UCSD men's water polo team got back on the winning track this past 
weekend. On Friday they beat 
Division I Air Force 12-5 , then 
on Saturday they destroyed 
Loyola-Maryrnount 21-3. 

Friday afternoon, UCSD went 
up against Air Force clad in 
sharp new caps from Italy. Was 
this a gimmick by coach Denny 
Harper to get his team psyched 
up for the game (similar to otre 
Dame's .... 'Caring green jerseys 
against USC)? Not quite; actually 
the old caps got lost at the Long 
Beach Tourney the previous 
weekend , so these ""Cre simply 
replacements. and so far, they've 

UCSD is 2 and 0 since wearing 
them, 

They won their second game 
in a row on Saturdy against 
Loyola of Marymount, a team 
they were expected to kill. 
Ho""Cver, midway through the 
first quarter, UC D found 
themselves trailing 0-1, and 
seconds later, the entire starting 
squad found themselves on the 
bench where they remained until 
the second quarter started . The 
Tritons' only score of the first 
quarter came on a counterattack 
goal by Darrell Denny after a 
beautiful pass from Phil Pettis. 

In the second quarter the team 
started to play the kind of ball 

they are capable of, exploding 
for 10 goals in the quarter. Add 
to that 10 more goals in the 
second half, and you have a nice 
win for the home team. 

This is the final weekend of 
the Tritons' regular season. 
Thursday they play Cal-State 
Fullerton at 3:30 pm, and Friday 
they play Sunset San Diego Club 
at 4 pm . In addition, they will 
play the alumni as part of 
Heritage Weekend on Saturday 
at 11 am. 

Also, for thf Tritons' two 
senior starters, these will be the 
final home games of their 
careers. Both Dan Kahl, a 

1M Playoffs begin 
this weekend 

transfer from Cal-Berkeley, and 
Duncan Millar, from picturesque 
Costa Mesa , are integral members 
of this year's squad. In addition, 
they are both All-American 
candidates, with Millar hoping to 
cecome UCSD's first three-time 
All-American in water polo.

EVERYONE can finally take a breather because the 1985 UCSD Intramural 
football season is finally over. For 
all of you who did not make the 
playoffs, you'll have to watch 
from the sidelines, while a 
selective few who managed to 
last into the playoffs will battle 
for SpOts into the finals in each 
of the five divisions. FollOWIng is 
a division-by-division look at the 
teams predicted to rise to the 
top. 

MA 
The teams in mis diVision are 

definitely the most. expenenced. 
Sqndy in the Hunt seems to have 
the Inside track to the 
champIOnships. ThiS team IS 
compnsed of players from last 
year's AAA champion, York Hunt 
Club and perennial M power 
Sandy and the Baggers. They are 
paced by quick receivers and an 
expenenced quarterback. TKE, 
who lost to Sandy in the regular 
season, are looking for sweet 
revenge in the final , but first 
must get by the always.tough 
boys from Butt State UnIversiry. 
BSU proved to be the best team 

in the Saturday league with big 
wins over the Herd and 
Chocalate City. The other teams 
left are the Cardiac Kids, the 
1984 M champion , and Charlie 
by the Sea. Both are capable of 
knocking off any of the other 
three. The future Doc's are quite 
explosive but Just may not be 
ready to play in this diVision. 
Charlie's may also prove to be a 
factor with their Wlde open style 
of play. It should be very 
interesting. 

AA 
This diviSIOn looks like a four-

team race, but the advantage has 
to go to Thank God JR's Gone. 
They have been ranked number 
one all season long and have yet 
to meet a formidable foe . Right 
behind JR are the Beach Heads; 
laSt years A champIOn, the 
Assasins; and the Berman's Boy, 
who have plenty of offense. 
Where's Steve loan who must 
first get by Passed Prime, may 
prove to be a factor with their 
Wide array of trick plays. Other 
teams to look for are Rude Boys, 
the Roach Motel , Team Ortho 
and Ax. 

A 
This division does not seem to 

have as many sandbaggers as it 
has had in the past. Look either 
for Phi Dflta Theta or the 
Blocking Heads to win the 
division . If neither one of these 
teams wins the championship, 
look for Tijuana Vice or Crazy 
Otto and the Unicefs. 
COED 

In the M division look for 
T cam Bozo to walk away With 
the title. This team's girls are far 
better than the guys. The 
Desperados and the Real Estates 
are me only two teams with a 
chance of upsetting Bozo. The 
best of the rest honor goes to 
Ferocious But Loveable, however 
they will have to play over their 
heads to beat the three others. 

In Coed A watch out for Rude 
kalors , Mom and Pop Are 

Watching and Hot Legs. Don's a 
Spaz have the talent, but 
sporadic play may be their 
downfall. The best chance of 
upsetting the top teams goes to 
Master in the Universe and the 
Pioneers, but the talent of the 
top teams will probably be tOO 
much. ~

Under the Arch: Men's 
Soccer goes to St. Louis 
T HE MEN'S soccer team is heading to St. Louis this Friday to take on 
St. Louis-based Washington 
University who are 19-2 on the 
year and ranked 13th nationally. 
The game begins at 11 am 
Sunday, Pacific Time. 

T he Bears are the Great Lakes 
regional champions. and earned 
the right to host this round by 
defeating last year's national 
champions, Wheaton, who v.'Cre 
ranked first in the nation. If the 
Tritons can beat Washington, 
there is a good chance they will 
host the remaining rounds. 
Washington hosted this round 
because they had to travel in the 
first one and because their 
soccer facility is new, according 
to the site selection committee. 

The Bears are said to be an 
offense-minded team, and are 
led by All-American forward 
George Shopin, who recorded 20 
goals and nine assISts. Mid-

fielder lack Edmond had eight 
goals and 12 assists, while goalie 
John Konsak had six shutouts 
and a 0.67 goals-against average_ 

The Far West regional 
champion Tritons are led by 
freshman midfie\der Robert 
Paterson's 17 goals - including 
the game-winner versus 
Claremont - and forwards Greg 
Schwarz and Bubba Wingate, 
each with eight goals. Senior 
halfback Phil Kenney now has 
seven goals after scoring two 
more in the first round . Goalie 
Alberto Gomez has recorded 15 
shutouts and a 0.40 goals-against 
average. 

The Tritons will be leaving 
Friday with a 22-person travel 
party. The NCAA is picking up 
the tab for air fare . UCSD is 
allotting $15 a day to each player 
for room and board, as well as 
$8 in meal money. The Tritons 
will be returning Sunday at 8:30 
on TWA flight #125. 

-John Schacht 

Clark just having fu~ 
By STEPHANIE KAUS, Staff Wnle, 

JOHN LEANEY, coach of the women's soccer team, is more than satisfied with the 
Tritons' performance this 

year. Every player has Improved 
markedly, and the team has held 
up in an extremely tough league. 
But if there is one player that 
can be singled out for 
distinction , it would without a 
doubt be forward sensation 
Adriene Clark. Clark has been 
the top scorer In nearly every 
game, finishing the season with 
a grand total, of L8 goals in 21 
games. 

Even more impreSSive IS the 
fact that the TritOns scored (I 
tota l of 53 goals , so Adriene 
scored a third on her own. 
Interestingly enough , she was 
also the leadi ng scorer last year 
with on ly fi ve goals, more proof 
of the astonishing Improvement 
of the team as a whole . 

Adriene has always been a 
major force of the Triton team, 
starting as a freshman fullback 
and sophomore halfback. But 
forward is the obvious position 
where she excels . Clark h(ld felt 
at the begInnIng of the season 
that she could do v.'C1I in thiS 

position , but was slightly 
apprehenSive about approaching 
Leaney. Leaney, meanwhile , had 
been kicking the idea around 
since tryout but wasn't 
completely sure as to whether 

Adnene Clark scored 18 goals In '85. 

Adriene wanted to play it. But 
after the first game her talen! 
shined through , and they both 
knew they were on to something 
good .

Fencers 
beat Oeey, 
UCSB 
By VAlERIE GULICK 

I N THEIR third meet last weekend , the UCSD men's fenCing team easily swept the 
newest comers to the conference, 
Occidental College , in all areas: 
foil 9-0 , epee 9-0 and sabre 8-1 
and overall 26-1. UC Sama 
Barbara proved to be a real 
spoiler to the team's record and 
beat the previously unbeated 
epee team by one bout 4-5, and 
the sabre tcam also 4-5. The foil 
team saved the day by winning 
their event 6-3, thus getting the 
desperately needed victories for 
an overall win against UCSB 14-
13. This maintains UCSD's 
overall undefeated standing in 
the Southern California Fencing 
Conference. Although each team 
has had its ups and downs, they 
have kept the lead In the 
conference In all areas: foil 5- 1, 
epee 5-1 and sabre -1-2 . 

Next week's match will be the 
toughest so far as UCSD battles 
the strongest teams in the 
conference, UCLA and CSULB. 
CSU LB is presently undefeatec..l 
overa ll and in sabre and epee. 
UCLA is also undefeated In sabre 
and fOIl. The three top places are 
pretty much up for grabs next 
weekend as UCSD completes the 
first round of the conference. 
November 23 beginS the second 
round of fencing. 

Thc women's team had a split 
day, losing to the more 
experien ed and taller UC Santa 
Barbara 4-12. The Occidental 
match was touch and go, with 
our women tying In bouts 8-8, 
but winning on number of 
touches on their opponenrs, 57-
49.

the team can be demanding, but 
maintains "I would never think 
of nOl playing. It's too much 
fun ." 

What's the secret to Adriene 's 
success? She Cites the E;xcellent 
coaching by Leaney as the 
reason . The coach, as she put it , 
"knows a lot about soccer." 
Leaney maintains that a 
combination of pace and 
exceptional ball control make 
Clark so powerful, along with her 
terrific attitude. Also , she can 
score on either foot and doesn't 
need to slow down and adjust 
her footing. 

What pleases Leaney most 
about Adnene is that he still sees 
room for improvement in her, 
and her willingness to learn . 
Next year he looks forward 10 
"maki ng Adriene even stronger." 
Her exceptional re cord thi 
season will be tough to beat, but 
with her attitude and talcn! It 'S 
likely .0at she will su rpass it. ~

Exploding tThe Alchetnist~ 
bV daniel thoma8 

The 1985-86 Drama Department season 
officially opens tonight with Ben johnson's classic 
tale of trickery and greed, The Alchemist. Directed 
by Walt jones, visiting director and head of the 
MFA directing program, the show will play at 8 pm 
Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights, and at 7 pm 
Sunday night, Nov. 14-17 and 21-23. All 
performances will be in the Mandell Weiss Center. 

Speaking with Hiatus last week, Jones spoke at 
length regarding the play and his treatment of the 
script. 

Hiatus: Who chose The Alchemist? 
Walt Jones: I did. (The department) asked me (last 
year), thinking about the students who were in the 
school, if I were asked to direct a project this year, 
what would I do? And then knowing the students as 
I had known them last year, and knowing what 
their appetites were, what kind of thing do they 
want? I thought this would be a good thing for them 
to do ... . I had to look at what I wanted to do, too. 

I first started getting interested in The Alchemist 
in 1972. Then again in '78 there was a possibility of 
it being done somewhere, so I renewed my efforts 
to make it even better and then dropped it. Last 
year I suggested it (to the department) as a 
possibility. Somebody asked me ... It's not usual 
that people ask directors what they want to direct; 
usually they just ask you if you're available and 
they tell you what the play is. This is a unique 
opportunity for me to do what I want to do, but the 
requirements are that . . . it can't be a two-person 
play. It (must) fulfill the needs of this school. I also 
have a little bit of marketability there, and we 
talked about what would be appropriate for a first 
show, inasmuch as this is a kind of season here .... 
So I just decided that would be a good production 
and I presented it to the faculty and they thought it 
was a good one, too. 

H: You mentioned there was something about 
the play you thought would interest the students? 

WJ: It's a funny play; I think it's fun to be in. It's 
a verse play, so that's challenging. You're not 
speaking lines that have been re-written 
substantially, you're really speaking 17th century 
language, poetry, verse. So I thought I knew that 
their appetites leaned in that direction, that they 
really wanted to do verse, and I thought this isn't 
done that much. The Alchemist isn't done a lot, not 
that much; with johnson they usually do Volpone if 
they do anything. So I didn't think that they would 
have a lot of big backlog of productions of The 
Alchemist that they would have to discard, so they 
really had no frame of reference for it - well, not 
no frame of reference, but it's like if you do Hamlet, 
you have a preconception of a black turtleneck and 
the dark. Most people didn't know this play and 
that was good. 

I didn't know I was going to have this job but I 
thought I would at least come back, if not this year 
then the following year - next year - to direct 
again, because I enjoyed working with them last 
year. So I talked it up. Even then, people didn't 
really run out and read it. It's a hard play; it's a 
really tough play; it's a very long play. There is 
another play of his, &rtholomew Fair, that I did in 
'75, and that play is something like a thousand lines 
longer than Hamlet. And none of these plays were 
ever really presented necessarily in the length that 
they are published. 

In the 17th century ... actors would make a 

l ____ --::.-:::-. _________ J 

decision, based on audience reception most of the 
time, whether or not to do a certain scene or a 
certain part of a scene .... TIley'd come backstage, 
say, and say, "There's a guy out front with 
tomatoes and he's been lobbying on them all night 
so don't do that." And they would say to each 
other, "You'd better not do that scene, it's too 
serious, you'd better not do this scene," whatever, 
and they would make the cut. Very democratic. 

To do a production of this kind of play I think 
presumes the director is going to act as those actors 
(would) and make a decision about what's going to 
be said. I also feel ... the director is the author of the 
production. The playwright is the author of the 
play. The director is the author of the production 
and has the responsibility, the right and the 
responsibility to explode the play he's working on 
and reassemble it. That's not to say you take a new 
play and throw the pages up in the air, and however 
they fall that's how you do it, but you have the 
responsibility to examine the structure of the play 
and to challenge the structure of the play. If the 
structure of the play is very important, it will make 
you do it in that way. 

If a play is a good play and it's lasted that long, it 
becomes a classic, but it doesn't mean that you 
have to perform the play in that way. 

As the author of that production, I have chosen 
that play, say, The Alchemist, to do because it 
amplifies something that I feel, and I will use it to 
amplify what I want to amplify, and I will cut away 
or reassemble or jog it around, or explode it if I 
need to, to make it make that point. If it's a good 
pIa y it will make its own point as well as making my 
point. But I have the responsibility to myself ... If, 
for instance, something makes me laugh and it's 
necessary for me to laugh in that scene, that's the 
way I have to do it. I can't worry about what the 

majority of people are going to think ... If it's a 
good play, and The Alchemist is, then the 
playwrights, Shakespeare for example, will survive 
the productions of their plays. 

H: Tell me about this play. 
WJ: There's a line, from Marlowe or one of those 

guys - "The wind that bloweth all the world, 
beside desire of gold ... " - that is common to 
every character in this play, and that's what 
Johnson was writing about with great disdain and 
distaste. It's a comedy, but it's a comedy in which 
no one escapes ridicuie ... They're all fools, all of 
them. It's a pretty heavy indictment, but it's also a 
very articulate play and a very lyrical, beautiful 
play. The biggest fools have the most beautiful 
things to say. Epicure Mammon is the biggest catch 
that these two crooks have come upon. Crooks -
it's a con operation, that's what this play is. The 
alchemist is a guy who reputedly changes all metals 
into gold, and that which he uses to do that is the 
philosopher's stone. It's called the magisterium, 
and it's this mysterious thing - most alchemists 
wouldn't even talk to each other about their 
methods, and they differed from each other in 
method so wildly that you didn't know who to 
believe. But in the same way that everybody wants 
to think that there is a fountain of youth and there 
is some regressive drug that will make you tum 
younger, and the same way that people wish there 
could be a time machine, people really want to 
know that those things can be, that something like 
that could happen. They want to believe it, in the 
same way that people going to a magic show know 
they're going to be tricked, but they want to believe 
that it's true. 

So these people come to these two con men ... an 
alchemist and his henchman. The henchman goes 
out and !lets them: it's a real stinK kind of

Just winging it 
by mathew meyer 

The Birdcage Review, UCSD's undergraduate journal of the arts, will 
publish its 11th consecutive edition this quarter . While this fact alone 
makes the Review the exception rather than the rule among campus 
literary magazines, the staff of the magazine is currently struggling to 
overcome a new set of challenges. 

"When the Birdcage Review began, in the spring of 1982, its 
development was paralleled by the growth of a strong, cohesive but small, 
group of artists and writers," says Mathew Meyer, co-editor of the 
magazine. "There were enough writers and artists who knew each other 
that the good material was available, was being written, right around us. 
The only problem was money." 

Today the situation is reversed. "We have enou(lh money, for the first 
time ever, but we, as editors, have become isolated from the people on 
campus who are making art. Most of our regular cOfttributors graduated. 
Jane Tassi's poetry and K.rl Rosseler's prOH, two veritable fixtures of the 
magazine, are gone. I100k at the staff box and the contents from last 
spring's edition, and 10 of the contributori and six of the editors are 
gone!" 

This exodus has left a vacuum which Meyer, co-editor Mark Cheney 
and managing editor CS CodV are struggling b:> fill. "It is a challenge. but 
we are not going to ait back and print nothin. but our own work, or the 
work of our~nds. We have an obligation to nurture theartscommunity 
on campus. Toward that end, we have increaled ~ number of Sifdcage 
Poetry Readings from three to 15 this year. The next reading is Friday, 
November 21 at 4 :30 in TCH~ 141 with Stephen Rodyer, Jane Tassi and 
David Dramm. We are not to be just a literary magazine; we have to find 
art, photography, music •. , Our problems are cOl;T1pounded because, 
unlike Roadwork and other m8i3zines on campus, we are committed to 
printing only the work of undgraduates. not &rad students or professors. 

"We have never had to .truggle so hard just to get material. L 
understand how busy students are. Every week there are events and 
activities I plan to attend, and I wind up missing them, so how can I expect 
every writer and artist on campus to remember the Birdcage Review? 

If there are artists and writers out there who do remember the Birdcage 
Review, they will be interested to leart) how the submisssion and selection 
process has change. "First of all, we eliminated our deadline. Anytime you 
have anything to submit, just lock up your garret and go to the nearest 
submission box and stick it in. There are b<;>xes in both Literature 
Department offices, the Music, Drama and Vis\.J3l Arts offices and in 
EDNA.

There was a time in 

America when the majority of 
her populace aspired to the 
same conventionalized social 
paradigm. During this era, the 
masses of this co untry 
vehemently supported a 
conservative president and 
the United States was engaged 
in a cold war with the Soviet 
Union. Another character-
istic of this period was the 
growth of an industrial and 
technological design that 
disregarded both the 
environment and the human 
spirit. It was this very social 
and political climate upon 
which the laments of poet 
Allen Ginsberg were 
unleashed. 

And the beat goes on Ginsberg's achievements extend far beyond his involvement with the beats. During the '60s, his political 
activity accelerated. He 
organized anti-war demon-
strations and traveled to Cuba 
to beseech equality for 
homosexuals and paid a visit 
to Czechoslovakia, where he 
spoke out for human rights in 
general. 

The period in question is as 
much 1985 as it was 1955, for 
Ginsberg, in a rare San Diego 
appearance this past weekend, 
demonstrated that his poetry 
is as applicable and urgent 
today as it was when he gave 
his historic reading at Six 
Gallery in San Francisco three 
decades ago. 

Last Sunday at San Diego 
State University's Monte-
zuma Hall , Ginsberg displayed 
his vitality with a series of 
brilliantly delivered poems. 
The years have not mellowed 
the poet; on the contrary, he is 
still as zany and vibrant as his 
reputation suggests. His 
orations of the classic poems 
.. Sunflower Sutra" and 
"Kaddish" were absolutely 

stunning. Although his more 
recent poetry seemed to suffer 
in comparison, this reading, 
unquestionably substantiated 
his position as one of 
America's greatest living 
poets. 

An interesting touch that 
Ginsberg brought to this 
reading was the guitar 
accompaniment of UCSD's 
own Matthew Rothenberg. 
This follows in the pattern of 
Ginsberg'S previous musical 
collaborations, some with 
such celebrated artists as Bob 
Dylan and Joe Strummer (of 
the Clash). Although 
Ginsberg's musical involve-
ment is an aspect of his career 
that is often ignored, it should 
be noted that he not only 

indirectly influenced a great 
many popular artists, but 
participated in their creations 
as well. His enormous volume 
of recorded work, including 
two records on which he sings 
the verse of William Blake, 
along with the "First Blues" 
compilations, are also among 
his musical accomplishments. 

Of course his most widely 
recognized association is with 
the "beat" generation, of 
which he was an early 
proponent along with 
William Burroughs, Peter 
Orlovsky, Gregory Corso and 
Jack Kerouac, among others. 
Ginsberg'S "Howl,' along 
with Kerouac's On the Road, 
are the most widely 

acknowled~ed literary 

manifestations of the "beat" 
philosophy. 

It was Ginsberg'S insight 
into the life of Kerouac that 
brought him to the UCSD 
campus after his public 
reading at State. He delivered 
a lecture to the English 
Literature 176 class on the 
essentials of Kerouac 's 
"spontaneous prose," 
attributing much of his own 
poetical form to his longtime 
companion and close friend . 
He confessed, "My reading 
style is ultimately derived by, 
literally, Kerouac's voice ... I 
owe it all to him. (Kerouac 
was) the seed a nd the model of 
how to talk idiomatically 
using tones of voice, r.igh and 
low, with pitch and volume." 

He is also a staunch 
Buddhist who studied for 
years in India and at home. 
Currently, Ginsberg lives in 
Boulder, Colorado, where he 
operates the Jack Kerouac 
School of Writing and-
Poetics. 

His visit to San Diego (the 
first in over a decade) 
reflected both his political and 
spiritual concerns. At age 60, 

. he is a man who has 
apparently suffered no loss of 
conviction. After 30 years, he 
still expresses the same belief 
in poetry that he does in the 
richness of life and the 
promise of this country . In his 
own words: "Who denies the 
music of the ..spheres denies 
poetry, denies man, and spits 
on Blake, Shelley, Christ and 
Buddha. Meanwhile, have a 
ball. The universe is a flower. 
America will be discovered." 

May the spirit of Allen 
~ Ginsberg live to witness the j fulfillment of his own

New writers are well .... versed 
by margaret carlin 

The New Writing Series is 
sometimes referred to as 
poetry readings, but simply 
presents new writing by the 
authors. Generally, one or 
two prose writers or poets 
read(s) his / her own work at 
each session. 

"We have a lot of poets, but 
(the writers) are not all 
poets," says Stephen Rodefer, 
curator for the Archive for 
New Poetry who organizes the 
New Writing Series . 
"Sometimes we have critics 
who give talks and sometimes 
we have conferences on 
literary subjects. We invite a 
wide variety of people that we 
think would best suit the 
student needs and pro-
fessional needs in the 
community." 

Such writers as John 
Ashbery, Denise Levertov 
and Adrienne Rich have been 
presented by the series in past 
quarters. Readings for the 

remainder of this quarter 
include those of Don Byrd 
and Jed Rasula (next Monday) 
and Judy Grahn (Nov. 20). 
Byrd and Rasula are editors of 
the Los Angeles based 
magazine Wch Way. Byrd is 
also a poet and critic. Rasula is 
a poet and "Has a very 
interesting job. He's a writer 
for the television series, 
Ripley's Believe It or Not, 
which is an ideal place for a 
poet to get information, I 
think." Grahn is a nationally 
known poet and lesbian 
activist. 

Not only does the New 
Writing Series present West 
Coast writers, but people 
from all over the world, as 
well. 

"This winter we're going to 
have an Italian poet and 
there's often Latin poets here 
from Central America," 
explains Rodefer. "Generally 
we plug into other organi-

zations which are bringing 
name people from abroad. 
Often (writers) already have 
some sort of arrangement in 
Los Angeles or something like 
that. " 

The New Writing Series is 
associated with the Archive 
for New Poetry, part of the 
Special Collections Depart-
ment of Central Library, 
which has one of the best 
collections of contemporary 
library material in the 
country. The series is also 
presented in cooperation with 
the Literature Department, 
UEO and the Center for 
Music Experiment. 

Often, the facilities of the 
Center for Music Experiment 
are used for larger presenta-
tions. During winter quarter, 
a group of five students are 
organizing a performance of 
Louis Zukofsky's "A"-24 that 
might be done in conjunction 
with the center . This musical

tTwelfth 
Night' 

by daniel thomas 
It is the opinion of Hiatus 

that the "verse-project" of 
Twelfth Night at the Warren 
Theatre not only succeeded in 
its "exploration" of the 
Shakespeare text, but also 
delivered up some excellent, 
entertaining theatre. 

To begin with, some 
liberties were taken with the 
script, but even where these 
were most evident, they were 
quite good in their effect. For 
instance, at the beginning of 
the show, several different 
scenes were "telescoped" and 
played as one scene, with the 
different actions taking place 
in different areas of the stage. 
This formed a striking, new-
style introduction to the 
matter of the play, and 
quickly moved the audience 

Directed by Ross S . 
Wasserman . Jeff Sugarman 
(Orsino), Bruce Seifert 
(Curio ;'O[ficeT) , Maria POTrer 
(Viola) , Mark Hofflund 
(Sebastian) , Dwayne Bartel 
(Cap tain / Priest) , Eugene 
Nesmith (Antonio). Michael 
McKee (O[fice/ Sermnt), Julie 
Briskman (Olivia), Gloria 
Mann (Maria) , Eric Grischkat 
(Sir Toby Belch). Brad Cottrill

Santos (Malvolio ) , Randy 
Braunberger (Clown) , Ivan 
Splichal (Musician).

into the work, setting up and 
whetting the appetite for the 
action to come. 

Director Wassermann had 
somewhat reluctantly 
informed Hiatus beforehand 
that a certain character had 
been "eliminated." However, 
without actually knOWing 
that, it would have been 
difficult to notice the change. 
The necessary lines were 
handed over to Maria, 
Olivia's maid, and the crucial 
garden scene actually 
appeared to be the better for 
its slight changes. Wasser-
mann is to be commended for 
exploring the text and daring 
to change it. 

Other directorial touches 
included the use of modern 
hardware, notably the tape-
deck for some onstage music, 
the duke's officers dressed in 
punk-style military green and 
most delightful, a refrigerator , 
six-packs and potato chip baL 
in the revelling scene. Having 
a lock on the refrigerator was a 
sttoke of genius, and then to 
pick it with a hairpin! 
Hilarious, and appropriate. 

It should be noted that 
these modern touches were 
restra i ned, and in this 
restraint came much of their 
effectiveness. There was a 
good balance struck between 
the classic Shakespeare text 
and the modern performance; 
the language, especially, was 
very well handled, with a lot 
of the old puns played out by 
the actors' gesturt<s and 
movements in ways that 
Shakespeare himself could 
not have helped but approve 
of. 

There was some use of 
affectation in the acting of 
certain characters, as is also 
quite appropriate in a rough 
and tumble comedy like 
Twelfth Night . Indeed, it is 
hard to imagi ne so me 
characters being played 
without affectation, such as 
Andrew Aguecheek, a 
delightful idiot. Others, such 
as the clown, showed 
remarkable and commend-
able restraint in the acting and 
gave insight into a deeper 
character underneath the 
surface foolery. Affectation 
was again tastefully used in the 
transformation of Malvolio's 
haughty restraint into a 
deluded .attempt to impress 

his lady with uncharacteris-
tically happy-go-lucky 
behavior. 

Crucial to the story is a case 
of mistaken identity between 
a brother and his sister who is 
disguised as a man. 
Fortunately, there was a 
similarity of appearance 
between the two players, 
except for their height, and 
this typical Shakespearian 
gimmick became almost 
believable. Again, the acting 
of the two , Viola and 
Sebastian, was fortunate in its 
similarity, and helped to 
convince even a skeptical 
audience that such a mix-up 
might be possible. 

The scenic design was quite 
good and as with the acting, 

drew great strength from 
restraint. A most wonderful 
touch was the tree in the 
garden, through the branches 
of which three devilish 
characters hid while setting a 
trap for a fourth . Then, to 
have them pull the tree back 
and forth, echoing the pacing 
of their intended victim, was a 
superb use of a piece of 
scenery. 

The Duke's palace was 
elegantly evoked wjth a few 
simple pillows, on which he 
would lie, pining for his love. 
Then there was the 
refrigerator. .. absolutely 
hilarious. 

Throughout, the tone of 
simplicity was followed, and 
the acting of the story stood 
out in good relief against that 
clear background. The 
director, the designers, the 
crew and the cast are all to be 
commended for their 
excellent work. 

Hiatus looks forward to the 
next "project," Moliere's Don 
Juan, in February. 

tBoesman' 
atECC 

by arthur .. lazar 
Professor Floyd Gaffney, 

from the UCSD Drama 
Department, directed a well-
integrated version of Boesman 
and Lena, a potent play about 
the sad existing conditions of 
blacks in South Africa, at the 
Educational Cultural 
Complex in Southeast San 
Diego last weekend. Athol 
Fugard's script, written over 

15 years ago, addresses issues 
- poverty, racism and apathy 
- that remain unresolved in a 
present-day society whose 
media constantly portrays an 
Africa in turmoil. 

In the play, a man and his 
lady are rraveling nomadically 
through the mudflat plains 
from one lost job to another . 
Their only possessions 
amount to less than the bare 
necessities : a couple of 
blankets, a jug of water, pots 
and pans and a scrap of bread. 
Boesman, as described by 
Lena, is a man good with his 
hands, an old dog, and a 
drunken fool who tells his 
lady," 'You don't want to sit in 
this world sober." From the 
dialogue one realizes that 
Boesman has been a "Stepin 
Fetchit," one of those white-
ass-kissin' plantation 
workers. Lena, in her words, 
is "an old bitch who's always 
being clobbered." This line 
was both humorous and 
tragic, a delivery that brought 
this play's central feeling to 
the forefront. 

The set design - their 
encampment at a mudflat -
has many levels for the actors 
to speak from, and under 
Gaffney's supervision it is 
dynamically used. At this 
land patch , Boesman and Lena 
meet up with another rraveler 
who speaks in an unknown 
tribal dialect. This man, Outa, 
is invited by Lena to share 
their fire, against Boesman's 
wishes. 

Boesman chooses the 
company of his bottle over 
Lena and Outa. Lena is glad to

Cream Hustler is still alive

In fact, now is a fine time

the ice cream is plentiful 
and the clerks are relaxed.

empty-handed. "Ice cream 
is ice cream," you say? No, 
no. The Niederfrank ice

Tastily warm homemade

Cream, Kahlua Krunch, 
Triple Chocolate, C conut 
Almond Joy and Butter-
scotch Marble. Just step 
one foot into this ice cream 
haven and you will be 
absolutely arrested by the 
scent of the baking cones. 
This, mixed with the sight 
of all that ice cream just 
waiting to be eaten, is 
enough to make anyone an 
a9dict. Believe me, I know. 

The Ice Cream Hustler 
boasts a wide range of 
flavors. Beginning with the 
altogether overlooked 
Vanilla, one could travel 

According to Sky and 
Telescope magazine, Novem-
ber is a good month to watch 
the sky. Under dark sky 
conditions (no moon in the 
sky, no street lights for miles, 
no clouds or haze) Halley's 
comet will be visible with 
binoculars, and there will be 
several meteor showers, 
including the unpredictable, 
sometimes spectacular Leonid 

meteors, which are predicted 
to peak during Saturday and 
Sunday nights. Since the 
moon is in its first quarter on 
the 19th, lunar light will not 
be a problem in watching pre-
dawn meteors (the best time 
to watch for the Leonids). 

Both Sky and Telescope and 
Astronomy magazines predict a 
10 meteor-per-hour shower at 
most, while the Griffith Park 

Observer predicts two dozen 
an hour. The Observer also 
mentions an Andromedid 
meteor shower, which will 
peak on the 14th of this 
month at 10 meteors an hour. 
This shower was once more 
spectacular, but it's orbit was 
perturbed by Jupiter in 1940, 
and it hasn't been the same 
since. Apart from meteor 
showers, a good observer can 

the short distance to Butter 
Rum and Pecan and end up 
with the sinful Amaretto 
Fudge Cheesecake. Sher, 
bets are also sold, and 
anything can be whipped 
up into a malt or milkshalce 
(well worth the prices of 
$1.80 and $1.75, respec, -
rively). 

The hours at the Ice 
Cream Hustler are, 
unfortunately, not geared 
to the needs of the average 
student. But, on any given 
weekday, from noon to 
4:30 pm, you can indulge 
yourself in any vice offered 
by the Hustler. 

Thankfully, the Ice 
Cream Hustler is not in the 
habit of weighing its scoops 
(a very tactless practice). If 
you are nice, polite and 
gracious, this arbitrary 
procedure can work in your 
favor. However, if you are 
impatient and demand your 
single scoop of White 
Chocolate Chip NOW, be 
prepared for a small 
serving. 

In any event, even if it's

stop by the Ice Cream

Space 
dream 
by arthur talazar 

Graeme Ferguson dreamed 
about filming the NASA 
space shuttles in flight with his 
newly invented 210mm 
ImaxiOmnimax cameras, to 
give "would-be" astronauts 
like himself a simulated, life-
like ride aboard. His idea 
required the help of our 
national space program and a 
$3 .6 million budget to 
complete. Once he acquired 
the necessary elements, 
Ferguson needed to plot the 
sequence of shots his " would-
be" film directors - the 
astronauts - took: . Fergu-
son's film, The Dream Is Ali\le, 
captures this man's concepts, 
ones that leave viewers 
dreaming of fantastic, 
uncharted worlds beyond our 
galaxy. 

The Dream, showing daily 
through mid-March at Balboa 
Park's Reuben H . Fleet Space 
Theater, is a feast for the ears 
as well as the eyes. The music, 
composed by Micky Erbe and 
Maribeth Solomon and 
presented in multi-track 
Dolby stereo, complements 
the heavenly spectacle one 
glimpse s through the 
astronauts ' eyes. 

As seen in the Space 
Theater's specially con-
structed diamond-dome, The 

Dream - its footage taken 
over a four-year span and

From the avante-garde to 
the traditional, this weekend 
offers an incredible lineup for 
dance enthusiasts. 

The weekend kicks off with 
the West Coast premiere of 

,"Untitled 1985 (if you don't 
know now you'll never)." The 
collaboration by chore-
ographer Alice Kaltman and 
sculptor Robert Rohm is 
narrative and explores the 
dynamics of male / female 
relationships. Using Rohm's 
sculptural pieces to help 
create a skewed domestic 
setting, the choreogaphy 
weaves its way around the 
sculptures in a moving 
statement about emotional 
interaction . The unique 
performance is being staged at 
the La Jolla Museum of 
Contemporary Art's Sher-
wood Auditorium Friday at 8 
pm. General admission is $7, 
$5 for students and seniors. 
Call 454-0267 for further 
information on this special 
melding of two diverse art 
forms. 

Tap dancing is becoming 
quite trendy; however, the tap 
dancing greats known as The 
Copasetics are no new-comers 
to this classic form of dance. 
The five "hoofers" trace their 
careers back to Harlem in the 
1930s where they helped 
bring this Black American art 
form to its peak. With 

credentials from the Cotton 
Club and Casino de Paris, The 
Copasetics are the Harlem 
Globetrotters of tap, swinging 
into routines of classic steps 
like the "buck and wing," 
"over the top" and "through 
the trenches. " These masters 
of tap are appearing in the 
Mandeville Auditorium 
Sunday at 8 pm. Tickets are 
$12 for general admission and 
$8 for students. Call 452-
6467 for additional informa-
tion on these tapping 
American treasures. 

Whether you sway towards 
avante-garde or traditional 
forms of dance, these 
programs promise to be 
evenings of exciting 
movement showcasing some 
of the best movers and 
shufflers.

Alchemy 
Continued from page 1 
operation, a shill and all that kind of stuff. They're 
very inventive and very funny about the way they 
do it, because these people are 0 gullible. It's too 
easy. These people want it; they want that (gold) so 
much that they want to be tricked. Epicure 
Mammon is the biggest catch of all, because he's 
got so much money, because he's ... so willing to 
give it to them. Subtle - the name of the alchemist, 
who is anything but subtle; they don't have to be, 
these people are so easy - Subtle says of 
Mammon, in a very strange speech that seems to be 

...::L complimentary, that Epicure Mammon not only 
.~ wants the money for himself, he wants to give it 
~ away; he wants to change the world to gold. He 
""§ wants to go to hospitals, to give it to the ~or. He's 
it: . still a fool, Johnson says; he's still a fool, a very 
.£ articulate one, a very imagistic one and literary. 
9 Mammon's language is some of the most 

{ beautiful language ever written; (it's) so beautiful, 
.., it just gushes with lust that turns itself into other ! kinds of lust - the obvious kinds of lust; sexual 
... lust, too. For him, lust is a very general erection, 
~ and he goes from a monetary lust to a lust of the 

spiritual. He embraces all lust; he is lust for life and 

r---. WlTHTIiISAD ____ _ 

that's what he wants. Subtle says of him he's just 
going to give it away. Subtle's still going to trick 
him; Subtle's still going to get the money out of 
him, the money for the philosopher's stone. They 
have all sorts of ruses to get the money out of him 
and they do a kind of good cop/bad cop stuff to 

~ake the people feel so shitty that they've got to 
give them the money. And they also build (failure) 
into their plan, failure to make the stone because of 
something that the person did. 

So because Mammon has a lust, because they 
know that he's a lusty guy, they bring on a whore at 
their house to arouse him. He's been previously 
told ~h,at piety, that virginity is the only way to go, 
that It s the only way he's ever going to get the 
stone. So they deliberately entrap him with this 
whore, and catch him with his pants down -
literally. And naturally, the stuff in the basement 
in the furnace that's making the philosopher'~ 
stone, blows up. 

Well, Mammon's not the only one; that happens 
to everybody. It's not even important that they get 
the things they came for ... Johnson says the root 
of all humanity is money, the desire of something 
you don't have. That implies a lot about the world 
in which we live. 

~iatus will. be attending the opening of the play 
tomght and mtends to publish a review of the 
performance next week.
