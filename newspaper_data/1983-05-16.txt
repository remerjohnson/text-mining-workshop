MEChA's praiseworthy 
Cinco de Mayo party 

By D'ARC\' SWARTZ 
Friday, ~ay 6 was thedayof 

the twelfth annual Cinco de 
Mayo celebration put on b) 
MEChA (Movmiento Estudi· 
antal Chicano de Aztlan) or the 
Chicano Student Movement of 
the Southwest. The celebra· 
tion. which took place on the 
Hump from midday until six 
0' clock, was an interesting 
com bi nation of a cu It ural 
theme, polit ical expression, 
and good fun. The importance 
of the annual Cinco de Mayo 
celebration is that it smashes 
stereotypes which Americans 
commonly harbor towards 
Chicanos, and it allows 
Chicano students at UCSD to 
express their unique cultural 
heritage. 

On this fine afternoon, 
about three hundred students 
and other members of our 
community gathered on the 
Hump to see Mexican dancing 
and to hear speakers from the 
Chicano mO\'ement in San 
Diego. Beer and food were 
served and the afternoon was 
topped off with a IJ\'e band and 
dancing. 

One organizer of the event 
told me that It ~hould not be 
referred to a~ a part\ but a~ a 
celebratIOn. Festl\'lty was part 
of all the acti\'itie~, but the 
event's real pu rpose was to 
celebrate the dav :\1exlco won 
Its independence from the 
colonial French, and alsu to 
celebrate Chicano heritage 

The cdehra rion em phasized 
the nchnes~ and uniquenessof 
Chicano cu ltu re. while it 
attempted to era~e common 
American stereotypes of 
Chicanos. For example. 
,.,e\'eral antIque. beautIfully 
restored "low rider" car" \\ ere 
dl"pla\ed. One ;\IEChA 
'ipokesperson told me that the 
purpose of dl"playmg the If)\\ 
riders was to break down the 
stereotype of Chicanos In 

shabb~ dress driving old. beat· 
up Chevy~. The car" were all 
cu"tom decorated. and each 
expre~sL'd the personality of 
Il!-. owner Together. the low 
riders are an expre" .. ;ion of 
unlqunes" and richness of 
Chicano l"uItUf(', and are 
con"ldered to \)e n form of an, 

St'\'('ral ..,p('a kl'r~ addressed

\'Iolence - but Intellect ual and 
moral st ruggle a" a means of 
hfting poor ChlCano~ out of 
urban poverty. and gi\'ing 
them t he mean" for cult ural 
self'expression. The metaphor 
of re\'olutionary struggle helps 
Chicanos to achieve solidarity, 
because the Mexican Re\'olu' 
tion is een as part of their 
heritage. rt must be stressed, 
however. that it is a metaphor. 
The struggle of the Chicanos is 
a cultural struggle. not a 
violent one, 

Aside from its cultural and 
pol it ical s ignlflca nee, the 
Cinco de Mayocelebration was 
good. clean fun. All attending 
tudent enjoyed entertain, 

menl ranging from traditional 
Mexican folk·dancing and 
good food. to a dance with a 
live band. I talked with many 
students who felt the 
celebration was as much or 
more fun than the TGIFs. 

The Clncl) de Mayo 
celebration is an example of 
the type of event which would 
be excellent for the AS Council 
to fund in the future. The

Letters to the Editor 

On Guardian Journalism and Libel 
Editor: 

Before [ "tart. I \\ auld like to 
make :.omf' comments on the 
exchange between 1\11'. Savage, 
and Dean Varga. First, I would 
like to compliment Mr. Sa\'age 
for finally putting his feelings 
(however childish ' "Don't 
harass .... c()ver your behind?") 
where they belong, in the 
opinion section, Second, [ 
would like to point out that 
with the '·cute." and desperate 
reply that Dean Varga 
received from Sa\'age, it wou ld 
tend to make one believe she 
hit the nail on the head. (In 
other words. someone got 
caught.>

stepping Iheir ethical bounds. 
Unfortllnatel~ it is the reading

mat t e r \\' hat po s sib Ie 
retribution we may receive, 
After all, papers cont inue 10 
print, so writers can always 
reply to criticism. as is Iheir 
right. But. all too often papers 
ignore these mistakes b~ 
hiding behind the "fmding the 
truth." and "freedom of Ihe 
press" banners, Believe me, I 
really didn't want to jump on 
the "down wit h the (;/((( rdiau" 
bandwagon. as did so many 
during the R. Williams fiasco, 
but, since so much injustice 
has been done by so few, it is 
time to respond .' 

To sa\' that the Gllardiall is 
a lihelo-lls paper IS far too 
st rang. Yet t hey seem to find 
great need for the lI:-.e of half, 
truths. Whether this is for 
"intere ·t ing'· journali"m I 
don't kllOW, In Ihe past, It 
seems to have been the way of 
writers to slant articles the 
way they want - examples of 
I his pract i ce wi 11 follow I a ter. I 
realize it i::-; hard for the 

(;/((/rdiuJI stafi to \\'rite 
\\ ithollt opinion~, on "ubjech 
that directly il1\'ol\e them, vet. 
the\, IJIllsf realize this it their 
nspolISibififyl Too often this 
paper is used as a toy for 
somebody's publicit y game or 
opinion. (U..,ing it a" a to), can 
and has hurt people involved. 
and Ihe paper's reputation in 
genera\.) Art Ides are written 
so as to present a "black and 
\\'hile" story, examples of this 
are the piece on R, Williams 
earlier this year and the recent 

"analysi~" -by 'a\'age on the 
llni\'ersitv Center. These 
were so black and while yOU 
have to wonder aboul how 
open the wrilers ' minds were. 
That 1:-. nOI considered good 
journalism. You sec. the R. 
Williams piece had been based 
too much on judgement prior 
to Writ 109 to be a good story. 
and at t he same time it had too 
much fact to be an op1l1lOn. 
That "analysis" by Savage 
was so drenched by personal 
opinion that it should have 
been lisled as an editorial.

There is no argument over 
the bird's endangered status. 

The California condor i" the 
l1lost endangered species in the 
L1nited States. Estimates of 
remallling individuals range 
from 19 to 23. There are on lv 
four breeding pairs. . 

The condor once flew from 
Canada to Mexico. It possesses 
the second largest wingspan of 
any hiI'd on earth with its 
majestic black wings 
stretching nine feet. Like 
many birds of prey it peforms 
the necessary function of 
ea t i ng disease, bea ri ng ca rrion, 
and needs an extensive 
amount of territory to roam 
and hunt. The cundor's 
natural habItat has been

provides an opport unity for 
Ihe l iS to finally do something 
right in the way of wildlJfe 
consen ation. The condor is " 
symbol of American wildlife 
a-nd its sur\'i\'al is crucial. 

There are two conflicting 
opinions as to how best to sa\'e 
the condor from extinction. 
The first. to leave the birds 
alone in their habitat. and 
hope that they can naturally 
increase their numbers. Part 
of this plan would include 
purchasing \'ast amounts of 
land to pre\'ent CI\ dization 
from further encroaching 
upon Iheir territor). 

Thl.., is the option with 
\\ hlCh t he SIerra Club. Friends 
of the Earth. and a fe\\ other 
cm imnmentalist groups "ide.

WHAT'S THE 
DIFFERENCE? 
The difference: A Written 

Guarantee. We have student 
discounts, and evening hours, 

just like many other shops. But, 
unlike others, we back up all our 

work in writing. If, after we've cut, 
permed, or colored your hair, you're 
not completely happy, call us within 
~even days. We'll redo your hair at no 

extra charge. That's a big difference.

Dave Awaits 
Med School 
Acceptance 

By SHARON HARRISON 
Slall Writer 

Dave is tinkering in hi s 
garage again, Clothed in baggy 
coveralls ~tained in grease, he 
is attempting to restore his 
motorcycle that was all but 
dest royed ina bad accident 
last year. Patiently, with what 
one might ca ll a physician's 
care, he goes over every inch of 
the machine. Which make 
lots of sense - Dave is 
awaiting his acceptance letter 
to med school. 

UCS D has a reputation as a 
hea\y pre-med campus, and in 
fact 20.6 percent of our present 
undergraduate st udents are 
biology m(1jors. Only a few of 
the most outstanding and 
impressive sl udents receive 
more t h(1n one acceptance to 
medical schcKll, allowing them 
to choose a campus they mighl 
fa\'Or. Most studentsjust hope 
for at least one acceptance. to 
any medIcal school. even after 
scndlllg lens of applications to 
va riou s campu!:'es (wh ich also 
gets expensive). And for every 
indi\' idual come individual 
problems. 

Dave went to LICSB right 
after high school. "College was 
just a place to be after high 
school." Dave admits, smiltng. 
"My grades were mostly S '!:, 
and Co.,. and I even failed two 
classl'>" that I had taken 
incomplete" in and ne\'er made 
up."

of the communictions majors 
and 72 percent oft he literature 
majors at UCSD are female. 

For graduate programs, 
there are even fewer women in 
traditionally male fields. In 
engineering, roughly 15 
percent of the graduate 
students are female, in physics 
only 8 percent of the graduate 
st udents are female, and in 
economics, 17 percent of the 
graduate students are female. 
Again, in liberal arts areas, 
such as literature and 
ociology, women are in the 

majority and make up 60 
percent of the graduate 
students in those areas. 

It would be misleading not to 
point out that significant gains 
have been made by women in

Program was established 10 
1980 with trust fund s set up by 
Mr. John G. Searle, who was 
president of the research· 
based pharmaceu tical Co., 
G.D. Searle and Co. 

Currently, more than seven 
million dollars have been given 
to 47 Scholars across the 
country to further research in 
medicine, chemi try and 
biological sciences. 

When Donoghue was a ked

he was one of the winners, he

many fields of study. At 
UCSD, the pecentageof female 
mathematics majors has 
increased from 30 percent in 
1978 to 40 percent in 1983. In 
the last five years, in areas 
such as economics and 
political science, close to a 15 
percent increase in the 
number of women has taken 
place, to the point now where 
there are almost an equal 
number of men and women in 
those areas at the undergrad-
uate level. 

National statistics also 
reveal gains made by women 
in the last few years. The 
percentage of women studying 
business and management on 
the collegiate level has 
incresed from 39 percent in 
1978 to 45 percent in 1980. 
Some gains have also been 
made in the field of law. [n 
1978, women comprised 30 
percent of those studying law 
and by 1980, women 
comprised 39 percent of those 
in law. 

Discrimination is one factor 
that has kept women from 
going into traditionally male-
dominated fields. Female 
students often have trouble 
being taken seriously by 
professors In fields where 
males dominate and where 
there are few or no female 
professors. 

More pervasive than blatant 
discrimination against women 
are social attitudes and 
conditioning that cause male 
and females tochoo edifferent 
areas of study. 

Sex role conditioning takes 
place from the time one i 
born. Women, to a large

extent. are not encouraged by 
family, friends, and teachers 
to pursue certain fields. How 
many women recall being 
given a chemistry set to 
experiment with when they 
were in grade school? 

Here at UCSD, some 
attempt has been made to deal 
with some of the bariers 
resu Iting in underrepresenta-
tion of female students in 
certain fields of study. 

Vice Chancellor o'f Under-
graduate Affairs Joe Watson 
pointed to support groups such 
as Women in Science and the 
Society of Women Engineers, 
which support women who go 
into nontraditional fields_ 
Workshop and programs 
sponsored by the Counseling 
and Psychological Services, 
Career Planning and Place-
ment, and the Women's 
Center also help deal with 
conflicts and barriers in 
pursuing studies and careers. 

For example, there is a 
workshop series bei ng 
oonducted this month entitled 
"Strategies for Successful 
Career Development for 
Women," which helps women 
deal with identifying long-
term goals, and role conflicts, 
along with presenting 
successful career women as 
role models. 

That inequity exists at 
UCSD between male and 
female students is amply 
illustrated through a 
breakdown, by sex, of students 
in the different major areas. 
The situation is improving 
some, but gross disparity still 
exists.

th slim budget hike. Says 
UC ' J) Chancellor Ri chard 
Atkinson, "llCS))".; ability to 
maintain the qualit y of its 
inst ruct iona I and research 
programs is diminishing 
rapidly. " 

The raw figures are more 
meaningful when they are 
brok n down into their various 
components. The UCSD 
Medical Center, which 
includes University Hospital 
in Hillcrest. had the largest 
increase, jumping from 21.7 to 
2;) percent of the total budget. 
The general campus rose from 
25.3 to 26.5 percent, and the 

chool or Medicine and the 
administration kept budgets 
wit hin .2 percent of the 
original. The big loser was the 
prestigious Scripps Institution 
of Oceanography, tumbling 
rrom 19.9 to 15.2 percent.

salaries," according to 
AlklOson. "(JCS]) has already 
lost a few or il s very best

losing-ot hers." 

If Deukmejian 's cuts are not 
rescinded. lJC faculty will 
have salaries 18.5 percent 
below those of comparison 
Institutions by June 1. The 
result has been not only a 
trend towards professors 
lea\'ing the school, but a 
growing ra te of refusal by 
those offered positions at UC 
campuses. 

Last year. one-third of those 
orrered faculty positions in 
engineering. physics. and 
chem istry declined the orfer. 
ThIS year. more than one half 
or the orren; in the same 
depart ments have been

European Travel 

N OW the Seamy Side 
By SCOT RHOADS 

I began my trip Ihrough 
Spain at one of that count ry's 
most popular tourist spots, 
,\1 a d rJ d . The 0 n h J'l' a I 
attraction I could fmd' 1I1 this 
city was the thrill of the nigh 
Impos ... ible challent'l' of 
attempting to disco\er \\hy 
any tourist would want so 
much as change plane" here. 
:\Side from the excitement of 
the occasIOnal coup and the 
no\,elty of observing an open 
and thri\ing neu · Nazi 
mO\'e111ent, Madrid has lit tie to 
recommend it. If you want to 
know w hat the Cit \. is like. 
Imagine Tijuana in the 1990's, 
Sumehov>, all I benan CIt ies 
louk the same from a distance. 

But I did not go there to 
admire the incompleted yet 
decaying buildings. After 
taking in the oneortwosights, 
foolish ly buying some canned 
food at a corner grocery and 
ruini ng a pair of pants at a 
nearb y laundromat, I

lay in store for me in this

read the remains of my travel 
book. Surely, I thought. there 
must be more to see m such an

to discover the hidden sights, I 
unwisely signed up for a 
guided bus tour for the second 
and last time that summer.

Hitting the Jackpot 
with Officer Jitn 

to him. He took it , th e corners 
of his eyes wrinkling wiLh 
amusement. barely visible at 
t he perimeter of those glasses. 
"Thank you," was all J cou ld 
think to say, but I think he 
understood. 

By THOMAS RANKIN 
News Edilor 

"Just between you and me," 
the cop asked, sliding his 
sungla se up ont o hi s 
forehead, "how fast were you 
going before I pulled you 
over?" 

"What are you writing me 
up for?" I asked. more than a 
little suspicious. 

He laughed, "Don't worry, 
I'm just sayin' seventy plu ," 

"I was goi ng about ninety, 
maybe ninety- five ," 

His eyes widened a bit. 
"Why'd you slow down? My 
cruiser won't do more than 
eighty." 

I grimaced. "Jesus." 
" Well," he sighed. "it's 

probably just as well. I radioed 
ahead to Wells. They were 
gonna set up a roadblock for 
you." 

We were inside of a small 
room. in a bui lding not unlike a 
portable class room at an 
impoverished high school, in 
the town of Jackpot, Nevada . 
Jackpot is tiny, no more than 
two casinos and a spread of 
trailer houses that burn red 
lights on the porch even in 
midday. The township 's sale 
source of income came from 
bored farmers across the 
border in Idaho and, it was 
becoming increasingly 
obvious, out-of·towners who 
rolled through the desert 
tedium at ex tra· legal speeds. I 
was await ing "trial." sitti ng 
within four wood paneled 
walls with a scattering of 
chairs and a folding table with 
a placard reading Homer R. 
jones. jus/ice 0/ tJze Peace. 

It was hot. my nerves were 
frayed, and I was stuck with a 
garrulous backwoods deputy 
who. I mused, might have 
possesed some not-so·pleasant 
ideas of the American judicial 
system. 

Ju st as he seemed ready to 
launch into a conversation, 
however, a bright red Blazer 
four·wheel-drive pulled up 
ou tside, disgorging an obese 
redneck in a flannel shirt. A 
massive revolver hung from a 
gun belt across his belly. 
dangling a lmost parallel to the 
ground beneath a roll of flab. 

The cop cleared his throat 
and dropped his sunglasses 
back down onto his nose. They 
wert' mIrrored: cold and silver 
Itke a 'iUb'7ero morning. 

" lIello, Homer." said the 
cop. 

"ll'lo Jim." He regarded me 
casually, 

"This our suspect?" 
"Yep. Here's th' paper." 

Officer JIm had siJpped eastly 
into t he sagebrush vernacular. 

J lomer tm)k the report and 
walked to the "bench," fallmg 
hea\lh Into hl!-' chair. 

"Wayall, lessee .. . " Ilomer 
!-'huffled through the paper· 
work for a fe\\ Illlnutes, finally 
looking LIP at me. head ~lIli 
tipped dr)\\, nand eye!-' rolled 

upward~. "Plea?" 
"e; utlt} ." 
.. A wrigh t...l hereby f md you 

in nolation of !-'ect ion ... er, 
well. spel'CIingon a publtc road. 
Fine will be in the amount of. 
ahh, say fifteen dollars ." 

I dug mto my wallet and 
pulled out a twenty dollar bill. 
handing it to him across th 
table. He drew a large wad of 
bills from hi~ breast pocket 
and began searching through 
it . All I cou ld see were fifties 
and h LI nd rcds. 

"S heeit." he muttered . "e'n 
you break a t\l,entv.Jlm?" 

"Sure can't. mallest I got is 
a twent y." 

Homer stood up and moved 
towards the door, sLopping to 
hand my twent y to Officer Jim . 
"Why don 't you take him over 
to the casino and get him some 
change?" 

"Sure th ing." 
Homer left without a 

backwards glance, back, r 
assume, to whatever activity it 
was that had pumped so much 
blood into hi s flapping jow ls. 
The Blazer fired up with a 
great roar and trundled back 
towards a distant cluster of 
trailers . 

Officer Jim gathered 
together his ~ear and stood up. 
"Let's hit it. ' 

He laid into the throt tie as 
he drove out of the parking lot , 
spewing a roo. ter tail of fine 
dust. Following in my own car, 
I mimicked him, now 
thoroughly into the pirit of 
the event. We roared towards 
the casino, s lewing across the 
rutted ground . I kept a firm 
grip on the steering wheel, 
watching the LTD's rear end 
bobbing and leaning through 
the turns. 

He stopped hi s car and got 
out, waiting for me with a 
barely noticeable grin . I 
followed him inside thecasino, 
a place called Cactus Pete's, 
which was in the process of 
receiving a new facade. 

r don't particularly like 
casinos, and once inside I was 
jarred by the vibrant lighting 
and the cacophony uf the s lots. 
It was obvious, however, that 
Officer Jim was in his natural 
environment. li e stro ll ed 
across the floor like a ship's 
captain, waving and nodding 
to t he dealers, change-makers, 
and prostitutes who smi led 
and called out , "Hey, Jim" or 
"Ho\\,;'s it hangin' today?" One 
of the whores, heavily made· 
up and obviously drunk , held 
out a welcoming arm to him as 
he approached. He gave one uf 
her buns a cursory squeeze 
without breaking st ride. 

Officer Jim reached th e 
cashier's booth before I did. 
leaning insolently against the 
counter and tossing the bill at 
the young woman behind the 
register. "Change," he said. 
hIS head making a practiced 
turn as he ran hi:-. gaze acrus~ 
the roolll. She handed hIm a 
ten and two fivcs. one of\\ hlch 
he held out to me. 

When I grabbl'CI it he did not 
Immed iately release hl~ grip. 

In~tead, he rolled hi~ ht'ad 
back sligh t Iy and we stood for 
a fraction of a second. just like

Men Finish Fourth 
In Div. III Tennis 

By MIKE GREENBERG 
Staff Wril"r 

NEW YORK - After easi ly 
di posing of the third ranked 
team in the nation , Swarth-
more, in the NCAA Divis ion III 
National Championships in 
Albany, New York last week, 
the men from UCSD were up 
against the best team in the 
country, the University of 
Redlands, in round two, Not 
only did the Tritons play their 
best tennis of the 1982-83 
season, but they almost pulled 
off the biggest upset in the 
sc hool 's hislory_ After 
sp litting the first six matches 
in the best-of·nine event, 
UCSD actua ll y went up one 
'et to love (two sets wins a 
match) in match seven as the 
doubles team of Eugene Jones 
and Lance Lareau played 
magnificently in 45 degree 
weather on the outdoor courts 
of the Albany campus, But just 
when Coach Don Kramer 
thought that his team might 
dethrone the eventual 
National Champions, the law 
of averages - a.k .a. too much 
opposi ng talent - came into 
play, Although the ensuing 
matches were close, Redlands 
s tarted playing superbly, 
wi nning count less key points 
to thwart the upset-minded 
Tritons, 6-3, in what Redlands 
players and coaches called 
"their toughest match of the 
yea r." 

Playing for third place 
against Kalamazoo College, 
lfCSD performed brilltantl) 
from the outset. taking a 
commanding :3·(} lead as Jones, 
Lareau. and Dave SIder all 
won convincingly. Rut in..,tead 
of \\inning the next t\\'o 

matches to finish in third place 
in thetournamenl. the Tritons 
suffered h ea rt breaking 
defeats in matches four and 
five, to give Kalamazoo new 
life. an opportunity they didn 't 
waste; Kalamazoo went on to 
down UCSD, 5-4. "We had 
some tou~h luck in that 
co ntest,' said Kramer 
referring to the 7-5 loss in the 
t hird set of match four and the 
7-6 loss (7-5 in the tiebreaker) 
in the final set of match five. 
"It was just a matter of a few 
points here and there that 
separated us from winning the 
title." Despite high expecta-
tions, Kramer was disap· 
pointed yet realis tic when 
reflecting on the events that 
took place. " [t 's all right to be 
disappointed, but you can't it 
around and mope if you gave it 
your best efforl," said the 
Triton coach whu directed 
UCSD to an impressive 17-9 
record in his first year at the 
helm. "We played so well 
against Swarthmore that we 
have nothing to be ashamed 
about. I think we played our 
best tennis all season long 
right here in New York." 

Several Tritons labeled the 
overall team finish. fourth 
place, "very disappointing" 
and they reiterated that 
commcnt when they discussed 
the individual championships. 
Kramer had anticipated big 
things from hi:-. lads in the 
tndi\lduab, but it \\as "imply

By MIKE GREENBERG 
Staff Writer 

When called upon, baseball 
purists can always come up 
with a logical excuse for why a 
team is not doing well. At 
Saturday's Padre-Dodger 
game I visited with a variety of 
different types, all of whom 
had their own personal theory 
on why San Diego was 
situated in fifth place with a 
lackluster record . Says John 
Graub, 42, of Escondido, "The 
Padres are not scoring enough, 
tha t's what's killing them 
.xjg:ht now_" I tried to point out 
tfia1:"San Diego was leading the 
league in runs scored , but 
Graub wasn't li s tening , 
Rai ing his voice loud enough 
so that all of Mission Valley 
could hear, he continued , "If 
Lezca no could hit his weight 
and if Garvey could hit orne 
homers we would be in first 
place. " Seemingly on cue, 
Irene Curtis, 77, a season 
tic ke t ho lde r s in ce th e 
fra nchise sta rted in 1969, 
interjected with a sweet voice 
that would put Mrs_ OLen of 
Folger's commercials fame out 
of work_ "We're nol getti ng the 
start'n pitch' n that we 
thought we'd get," says Curtis 
matter-of-fact ly, "Plus our 
ba:;erunning IS terrible: we get 
picked off base too much." 
Adam Beck. 9, sporting a 
Huckleberry Finn smile, had a 
different view. "Our bu llpen is 
what is doing us in," says 
Beck, who along with three 
friends had managed to move 
do\,,-n from thei r $4.50 third 
deck seats to the $7.50 loge 
<;ec.t IOn somet I me bet ween the 
third and ;-,e\ enth innings. "If 
we had 'a Bruce Sutter or a 
Goose Gos~ae we would be in 
great shal;e," he added 
ent hU..,lasl1c .. tll \'. 

Eq'n thougli the trio from 
three dIfferent generations 
raJ"ed some ahd pomts. the) 
\\ere all Ill~'orrect III theIr 
a"sl'"smenh ()n what'" \\ rong 
\\ ith the Padre". But they can 
not be iaulled for not fll;ding 

the reason. Simply because the 
answer does not lie on the 
baseball field, but instead in 
the clubhouse, a place seen 
only by the media, the 
manager, and the ballplayers 
themselves. During the recent 
homestand that concluded 
with yesterday's 3-2 Dodger 
viclury, many members of the 
Padres seemed to be on trial for 
what the press terms "failure 
to produce a winningteam _" In 
fact, Gary Lucas, Luis Salazar, 
Ruppert Jones, Garry 
Tcmpleton, John Montefusco, 
and Gene Richards have 

Total unevquivocal

description of Lord 
Williams' domain.

already been tarred and 
feathered by the San Diego 
media even though a verdict 
has vet to be handed dow n. 

Unbelievably, the one man 
who is di rectly responsible fo r 
the cl ub's poor ta rt and 
eventual fourth place fin ish 
has gone vi rtuall y unnoticed 
by San Diego's fi ne;-,l. I' m 
referring, of course, to 
Manager Dick Williams, True, 
the man has won an infi nite 
amount of games, including 
three world champion;-,hips 
WIth the Oakland A'" 
(1972, 7:l, 74). No one will 
dispute the man"" abilIty to 
manage: hi" ow n peer"

motilator, and his ab!lll\ to 
dcvelop ~()ung talent Into 

proven superst ars IS unpar-
alleled. But what about after 
the young talent is developed 
and the team is ready to win? 
Williams (the same can be said 
for Yankee manager Billy 
Martin) carries around with 
him an ugly defect that will 
always hamper an eXDCrienced 
club - his inability to 
communicate with his players. 
If one looks at the aforemen-
tioned list of players, one will 
discover that all of the above 
are veterans, proven a thetes 
who have been accustomed to 
handling difficult situations. 
as they see fit. But when 
Williams manages, he runs the 
s how. Total. unequi voca l 
autonomy is th e descript ion of 
Lord Williams' domain . Any 
peasant who try to stand up 
for th eir own rights are 
thrown into the dungeon. If 
you don't believe me, jus t ask 
Gary Lu ca s. Th e Padre 
reliever, one of th e league's 
best left -handers in 1980 and 
'81 (the yea rs preced i ng the 
King's arrival ) is now locked in 
a sma ll , sme ll y cha mber; 
almost certa in dea th awaits, 
as he will most assuredl v be

more common ly known as 
baseball's wai\'er list. 

For the past year and a half I 
have seen the t ransformation 
of a team from contender for 
the National League ti t le a 
season ago to a problematic 
ba llclub that will have to play 
extraord inarily to finish th ird. 
What lit tle morale thi s club 
had in Spring Train ing is 
com pletely gone, just 30 games 
into the schecl ule. After a 
victor\', the clubhouse is 
upbeai . but in no way dnes it

worr~ 1I1g about -this perfor-
mance and whether he IS gOlllg 
to bl' "ubjected to a William" 

Some players simply can not 
respond to that kind of 
pressure . Unfortunately, as 
long a s Dick William s 
manages the Padres , that type 
of pressure will always exis t , 
as will San Diego's inabilit y to 
win a divi ion title.

for, lost his qu arterfinal match

nation's 12th ranked player 
said that although he didn 't 
pl ay like he wanted to, fat igue 
was a facto r. " I had some close 
matches all week long, and it 
took a toll physica ll y by the 
time I reached the quarter-

Although the main empha-
sis of the trip \\'a~ to win the 
nationa l tit le,theexperienceof 
competing in a national title 
will ;-,urely remain in the 
mi nds of the Triton players for 
years to come: 
-Dave Sider, junior: " We had

experience. I was hoping to 
come back to San Di ego with a 
gold medal in the indi vi duals

-Lance Lareau, jun ior: "It

- Dave Reer~ . fre<; hma n: " It

was great coming a ll the way 
to New York. I played prett y 
well because I was super 
psyched at thc beginning. I 
could have played belteron the 
bigger poi nts but that will 
come from experience_" 

On an even mo re bright 
note, Jones, SIder, and Lareau 
a ll wcre named bv the 
Intercollegiate T('nnis

So despite a disappoint ing

look very good for l. C 'n
