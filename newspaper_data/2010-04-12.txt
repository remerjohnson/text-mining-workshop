Roughly 200 students and faculty 
members — wearing surgical masks 
and black tape over their mouths 
to symbolize censorship, and bear-
ing signs with the slogan “Art is 
not a crime” — engaged in a “silent 
march” on April 8 to protest the 
university’s ongoing investigation 
of visual-arts associate professor 
Ricardo Dominguez.

The university launched a formal 
investigation after Dominguez and 
the b.a.n.g. computer lab — a collec-
tion of UCSD students and faculty 
who use technology as performance 
art  — staged a Virtual Sit-In during 
the March 4 “Day of Action” protest. 
There, he invited people  through 
online advertising to initiate a com-
puter program he designed to over-
load and potentially crash the UC 
Office of the President Web site. 

Approximately 400 participants  
took part in the sit-in. The program 
also redirected some links on the 
site to a 404 error message that 
replaced the typical “URL cannot be 
found” text with phrases like “There 
is no transparency found at the UC 

Police also investigate 
Dominguez’s involvement 
in a cell-phone app that 
aids illegal immigrants.

After a contentious student-gov-ernment election featuring three new slates, seven presidential 
candidates and the first incumbent presi-
dent to run for reelection, Revelle College 
junior Wafa Ben Hassine won the 2010-
11 A.S. Council presidency on April 9.

Ben Hassine, who is currently a campuswide senator, won 
the election by a margin of 278 votes over incumbent A.S. 
President Utsav Gupta, who came in second. 

The outcome of the presidential race was heavily influ-
enced by the single transferable vote system. Using the STV 
system, voters are asked to rank the candidates in order of 
preference. In the event that a student’s first-ranked candi-

A recent UCSD study has linked 
drug use among teenagers to their 
involvement in social networks, 
their sleeping patterns and their 
proximity to individuals with simi-
lar habits.

Assistant professor of psychia-
try Sara Mednick used informa-
tion from an online database called 
the National Longitudinal Study 
of Adolescent Health to determine 
whether teenagers who have friends 
with poor sleep patterns are likely to 
adopt similar habits. Furthermore, 
it was found that irregular sleeping 
habits oftentimes lead to increased 
marijuana use. 

Mednick — along with Harvard 
sociology professor Nicholas 
Christakis and UCSD political-
science professor James Fowler — 
examined social behavior within 
the networks of more than 8,000 
students from the seventh to 12th 

grade. Participants were asked to 
answer surveys that included ques-
tions about their sleep patterns and 
drug use.

The students were also asked to  
give the names of five male and five 
female friends, who were in turn 
asked to fill out the same survey and 
name their friends — effectively cre-
ating a network. Participants retook 
the surveys three additional times, at 
intervals of three years. 

“We were able to track how these 
behaviors that kids were having 
the first year changed across the 
years, and how the effect of new 
friends also affected their behavior,” 
Mednick said. “So, if I knew you as a 
friend and you started smoking pot, 
[we analyzed] how likely it would be 
that I would start smoking pot.”

Using this data, researchers 
found that collective drug-and-sleep 
behaviors  extended to four degrees 
of separation in social networks. 

According to the study, if a mem-
ber of an individual’s given net-

work sleeps less than seven hours, 
the likelihood of the original indi-
vidual sleeping less than seven 
hours is increased by 11 percent. 
Additionally, Mednick found if a 
participant reported using marijua-
na, his or her friend would be 10 
percent more likely to use the drug 
as well. 

The study also concluded that a 
participant’s tendency to use drugs 
increases by 19 percent if they have 
a friend who sleeps less than seven 
hours a night. Though the correla-
tion was more dramatic between 
individuals who were direct friends, 
participants were 5 percent more 
likely to use drugs if an acquaintance 
within four degrees did so as well. 

Mednick said her discoveries can 
be explained by a strong social influ-
ence among teenagers. For exam-
ple, if you have a friend who rarely 
sleeps, you — through spending 
time with your friend — will prob-
ably adopt similar habits.

“In order to have my sleep affect 

your sleep, we’ve got to be physically 
involved with each other,” Mednick 
said. “It’s a more influential aspect 
— a more direct aspect. That way, we 
can actually hang out together, not 
sleep together and maybe even do 
drugs together. These are the social 
aspects of a strong influence.” 

Mednick said she will contin-
ue her research by examining the 
effects of napping within a network.

By Angela Chen

Before results could be 
announced at the A.S. election at 
Round Table Pizza on April 9, the 
election committee had to address 
a number of grievances filed against 
various slates. 

According to A.S. Election 
Manager Vishal 
Kotcherlakota, current 
Vice President of Finance 
and Resources Peter 
Benesch filed a griev-
ance against the Tritons 
First slate on March 
30. Kotcherlakota said 
Benesch accused the 
slate of pre-campaigning 
by reaching out to stu-
dent orgs through email 
before the official cam-
paigning period began, 
and of posting fly-
ers on the Chancellor’s 
Complex. 

In addition, the griev-
ance stated that Lynne Swerhone and 
Ryan O’Rear, current Muir College 
senators who ran for reelection on 
the Tritons First slate, violated elec-
tion protocol by promoting their 
slate on the their KSDT radio show 
“Muirworld.”

Kotcherlakota said the commit-
tee struck down the first complaint, 
but ruled that Swerhone and O’Rear 
had indeed violated election guide-
lines, and prohibited them from 
campaigning for one day. Although 
Benesch appealed the ruling to the 
A.S. Judicial Board, a board consist-
ing of seven non-council students 
appointed by the president, the 
board upheld the sanction. 

However, Benesch’s actions 
prompted a public apology from 
the Tritons First slate during the 
vice-presidential debates on April 
5. Both Swerhone and O’Rear were 

reelected.  
Independent presidential candi-

date Tan Dhillon filed an election-
day grievance on April 9 against 
incumbent A.S. President Utsav 
Gupta, who was running for reelec-
tion. Dhillon claimed that Gupta, by 
keeping the Web site he had created 
during the 2009-10 election without 
specifying the year of his campaign, 

was being decep-
tive. 

However, Gupta 
said the Web site 
was only active so 
the Guardian could 
keep him account-
able for campaign 
promises. 

The Students 
First slate also filed 
two election-day 
grievances against 
Tritons First, both 
for violating elec-
tion protocol in 
Eleanor Roosevelt 
College.

In the first grievance, the Students 
First slate — represented by ERC 
senior Chris Westling — accused 
the Tritons First slate of posting un-
approved election posters in the ERC 
common areas. 

“This directly targets the fresh-
men voters and gives Tritons First 
an unfair advantage,” Westling said. 

According to both election and 
college protocol, campaign flyers 
must be approved by resident advis-
ers before being posted in colleges. 
As evidence, Westling presented 
photos — taken by Students First 
campuswide senatorial candidate 
Noor El-Annan — of the posters, an 
explanation of flyer policy from ERC 
Resident Dean Rey Guerrero and a 
note from ERC R.A. Samantha Lee 
stating that she had not approved 
the flyers. 

However, the Tritons First slate, 

represented by presidential candidate 
Brian McEuen, said that the accusa-
tion was a miscommunication. He 
explained members of Tritons First 
had approached Lee’s co-R.A., Cody 
Griffin, to ask permission to hang 
the flyers. McEuen said Griffin gave 
his approval without notifying Lee. 

“This is a misunderstanding and 
the problem comes from having two 
R.A.s, not on the part of the candi-
dates,” McEuen said.

Students First also accused 
Tritons First of “dorm-storming” — 
visiting individual dorms to cam-
paign. 

According to A.S. election 
bylaws, disqualification — the sever-
est consequence of a grievance rul-
ing — only occurs when the accused 
party demonstrates malicious and 
repeated violations, or when the vio-
lation is so significant as to change 
the election outcome. 

The most significant grievance 
in recent A.S. history occurred dur-
ing the 2003 elections, during which 
Vice President Internal candidate 
Steve York filed a grievance against 
a Students First! slate. York claimed 
the slate had violated election proto-
col by displaying campaign posters 
on April 10, instead of taking them 
down the night before. 

As a result, the committee — and 
later the judicial board —disquali-
fied the entire Students First! slate 
including Vice President of External 
Affairs-elect Rigo Marquez, who was 
replaced by Harish Nandagopal, a 
candidate that shad run for the vice 
president of finance and resources 
position on the Students First! slate.

According to Kotcherlakota, the 
judicial board decided to overturn 
all three of this year’s election-day 
grievances, and the rulings had no 
effect on the results of the election.

For me, one of the biggest perks of Spring Quarter — though it takes a distant second to 
bidding the Making of the Modern 
World program a tearless adieu — is 
the opportunity for artificial reinven-
tion. 

While I personally have yet to sign 
up for RIMAC salsa classes or organic 
chemistry, if the sorority hopefuls 
hustling to the shuttle stop by my 
apartment in fuck-me heels mean 
anything, it’s that spring is the season 
of change. 

No better evidence of this fleet-
ing reinvention exists, though, than 
Admit Day. 

It’s a small 24-hour window to 
convince Mom, Pop and their new 
little admit that — barring all rumors 
that UCSD is home only to bio-nerds 
and KKK members in training — 
we’re actually a lively campus that 
promotes diversity, an active lifestyle 
and a host of other admissions-office 
buzzwords having little to do with our 
actual college experience. 

The student-org leaders and 
financial-aid officers crowding Library 
Walk last Saturday were are all part 
of a careful illusion that our school 
is an impossibly welcoming bastion 
of higher learning — where there’s 
always someone to offer a friendly 
smile or full-color satire newspaper at 
every turn. 

The strongest sell of all, though, 
is the unremitting SoCal sun, which 
somehow manages to part the clouds 
and shine down on freshman hopefuls 
in an act of divine interference on the 
second Saturday of April, every year, 
without fail. (Curiously enough, at 
press time, it’s in the low sixties and 
overcast. Excuse my resentment.)

It appears not even a race war nor Bill of Rights battle can permeate UCSD’s ever-victori-
ous air of apathy. This A.S. election 
season, voter turnout dropped a few 
percentage points compared to last 
year despite a supersized candidate 
pool and what seemed to be a brief 
spike in interest in campus politics.

Once again, Students for 
Affirmative Action Committee 
members — who officially endorsed 
Students First presidential candidate 
Wafa Ben Hassine — proved more 
powerful than the disinterested 
majority (who will ironically com-
plain all year about how the Sun 
God lineup sucks and how UCSD 
is socially dead, despite having 
neglected their five-minute oppor-
tunity to have a say). 

At the same time, in the face of 
recent unpopularity, current presi-
dent and 2010-11 candidate Utsav 
Gupta proved that a killer cam-

paign can almost topple the SAAC 
trend, along with the fact that he is 
the single best campaigner in the 
universe. (Sarah Palin best come 
knocking if she has any intention 
of bagging the U.S. presidency in 
2012). 

What A.S. President-elect Ben 
Hassine can learn from her fellow 
candidates is that, in addition to 
her promises to lessen our carbon 
footprint and diversify our student 
population, she has been elected to 
represent the interests of all constit-
uents. Just as importantly, she has 
been elected to throw a yearlong $3 
million party to help us forget we’re 
wasting precious youth working our 
asses off at a failing institution.

But if Ben Hassine only fulfills 
one responsibility this year, she 
should play the role of mediator 
to what is destined to be a feisty 
forum. No future president will 
ever get as much done as Gupta — 

he’s superhuman when it comes to 
the grindstone. The only way Ben 
Hassine can achieve similar levels 
of productivity is to unite council-
members so they can get shit done 
together. 

As usual, campuswide senators 
are sure to clash: Inexperienced 
firecrackers like Deyna Roberson 
will be sitting next to seasoned 
strategists like Zoe Seher and Victor 
Flores. The cabinet is similarly 
loaded for crossfire, with odd-
woman-out NOW! cheerleader 
Kristina Pham alongside Tritons 
First candidates Andrew Ang and 
Michael Lam.

Pham will probably run a similar 
term as current Vice President of 
Student Life Ricsie Hernandez — 
hands-off and Concerts & Events-
focused — and Lam is likely to drift 
from the council like this year’s 
Vice President of External Affairs 
Gracelynne West. Vice President of 

Finance and Resources-elect Ang 
has proven either too headstrong 
(while ignoring sound advice) or

SARAH ARAKAKI/GUARDIAN

By Wafa Ben Hassine
A.S. President-elect

It is my pleasure and honor to have been chosen by the student body to be qualified enough to 
represent them. I would not be in this 
position had it not been for the over-
whelming support that the Students 
First slate and I had been receiving all 
along. Needless to say, Friday night 
was an immensely humbling experi-
ence.

However, getting elected into 
office is not an accomplishment. 
Campaigning only means so much 
until the year is over and the stu-
dents can check off all the changes 
the Students First slate promised to 
make. I will be more than happy to 
accept an accomplished status upon 
exiting office with a record that ful-
fills our slate’s promises. 

Friday night, Tritons First swept 
the elections, taking most of the sena-
torial seats and two out of the three 
vice presidential positions. Contrary 
to what some may think, I believe 
that the goals of both Tritons First 

and Students First align. Together, we 
are a group of committed individu-
als who are looking to make paying 
college dues easier, cut waste from 
the annual budget, promote environ-
mental sustainability, ensure student 
safety and enhance student life to 

make it more 
exciting.

Throughout 
my campaign, 
I spoke a lot 
about insti-
tutionalizing 
activism in the 
UCSD commu-
nity and within 
the Associated 
Students. This 
activism entails 
several aspects.

First, I want 
to see the A.S. 
Council make 

more informed funding decisions, 
spend money in a sustainable manner 
and revise the budget to cut waste. I 
will be chartering a committee soon 
that will be responsible for doing this. 

This committee will then present 
to council a couple of weeks before 
we pass the budget, allowing for any 
changes to be made after hearing 
their recommendations. I will also be 
working very closely with my friend 
and colleague Andrew Ang — vice 
president of finance and resources 
elect — to carry out said reforms.

Second, as president, I want to 
ensure that our A.S. Council is com-
mitted to seeing a more environmen-
tally sustainable campus. We need to 
focus on furthering our sustainability 
efforts, and this can be done in a 
myriad of ways. Styrofoam in Price 
Center, the sale of bottled water and 
the lack of bike lanes on this campus 
are but a few of our school’s environ-
mentally unsound characteristics. 

Of course, the initiating step to 
repair said issues is voting in a posi-
tion for associate vice president of 
sustainability. This position would 
be a working liaison between the 
Student Sustainability Collective and 
the A.S. Council. The AVP would 
also conduct a yearly audit of A.S. 
sustainability efforts and provide 

weekly written reports of campus 
sustainability efforts to council. The 
AVP sustainability’s responsibilities 
are also external: The AVP would 
advocate for environmental policies 
at municipal and state levels, when 
students are directly impacted by said 
policies.

Finally, with the students facing 
even steeper hikes in registration fees 
next year, it’s about time that the A.S. 
Council dedicates its energy to fight-
ing the budget cuts. We are in a crisis 
of diversity, and — working with 
Student Promoted Access Center for 
Education and Service — we have 
to fight for a more diverse student 
makeup through sustainable outreach 
to historically underrepresented com-
munities. 

We are also in a crisis of privatiza-
tion. The California Master Plan for 
Higher Education’s promise of free 
public education has been ripped to 
shreds. Unified as a student body, we 
cannot stand up for that. We need 
an A.S. Council that is not afraid 
to get political and be biased for 
the students: We need to empower 

students of all backgrounds to shape 
our school’s future. Some of the most 
important happenings of this upcom-
ing year are the California guberna-
torial and midterm elections. I will 
work closely with the vice president 
of external affairs to bring each can-
didate to our campus and allow the 
students to be well-educated before 
casting ballots. 

Besides attending all UC Board of 
Regents meetings, I would also like to 
have our council go on lobbying visits 
together. If finances permit, council-
members will be expected to go on 
quarterly lobbying visits. Working 
with the vice president of student life, 
the trip can serve as a retreat and an 
opportunity for the A.S. Council to 
be better informed and, subsequently, 
put greater pressure on California 
legislators to reprioritize public edu-
cation when passing the budget. 

Above all, I am looking forward 
to a year of service and keeping the 
students’ interests at heart, both with 
local administration and external 
elected officials. Thank you, and I 
hope to serve you well.

THE RIVETER By Ronnie Steinitz

Whether a clairvoyant meteorolo-
gist is enslaved in a heavily guarded 
room in the admissions office, I can’t 
be sure. But I do know that — for 
anyone whose home lies north of the 
La Jolla bubble — a campus flooded 
in sunshine and free food is a pretty 
strong sales pitch. 

It’s also a misleading one. Of 
course, nowhere in any student-led 
campus tour or UCSD brochure 
might new freshmen — ink still 
wet on their Statements of Intent to 
Register — find any mention of the 
infuriating tangle of red tape at this 
university inhibiting everything from 
enrolling in classes needed to gradu-
ate on time to picking up a care pack-

age from home after 4 p.m. 
And why would they? Wasting a 

Saturday on the real UCSD experience 
— the one comprised of Grade-D din-

ing-hall mys-
tery meat 
and lecture 
halls so huge 
they require 
prescrip-
tion glasses 
— wouldn’t 
serve any-
one’s inter-
ests. 

Naturally, 
tablers on Admit Day (myself not 
excluded) are desperate for fresh meat 
to fill their soon-spacier org meetings. 

I can’t help but think, though, 
after witnessing so much staged 
Library Walk merrymaking, that 
despite all the bureaucracy and 
undercooked chicken, it’s too bad 
the greatness of this place doesn’t 
stand on its own. Last I checked, the 
beach isn’t a short walk from UCLA 
or Berkeley, nor can they boast the 
almighty presence of Ben and Jerry in 
their dining halls. 

Perhaps our admissions office 
doesn’t rank those advantages as 
highly as pamphlet-friendly headers 
like “diversity” or “community” — but 
it’s a shame the three-ring admissions 
circus overshadows what small joys 
UCSD actually can offer on the pretti-
est day of the year.

Dear Editor,
Thank you for your April 1 story 

“E-mail Mishap Raises Concerns 
Over I-House Admissions Process,” 
about the discriminatory, race-
based admissions process at the 
International House. I am “John,” the 
student mentioned in the article.

I am writing in response to 
Jeremy McGrew, who told the 
Guardian that “anyone who is try-
ing to criticize the setup of this, or 
how they run it, is trying to throw a 
wrench in something that’s moving 
very smoothly.”

The system of using race in 
housing is not a “good setup.” In 
Eleanor Roosevelt College’s writing 
series Making of the Modern World, 
we learned how white people once 
systematically denied housing and 
other rights to blacks. That was not a 
good setup, and it was racist. I-House 
should not hide behind a cloak of 
diversity when what it really supports 
is continual racism and discrimina-
tion. In calling the I-House admis-
sions system a “good setup,” maybe 
he was not aware of it, but McGrew 
used the same arguments made by 

supporters of southern Jim Crow 
laws, who thought someone “crazy” 
like Rosa Parks was fighting some-
thing “that’s moving very smoothly.” 
We know Rosa Parks was not crazy; 
she was courageous in standing up to 
institutions and “good setups.” Over 
something as trivial as a seat on the 
bus, she took a stand and we are now 
indebted to her as a nation. 

We stand with Rosa Parks, and 
we need to tell UCSD I-House staff 
that their defense of a system that 
denied admission to Mexican, Asian, 
black, white and other students based 
partially on race or national origin 
concerns is indefensible. 

—“John”

EXPIRES 2/15/10

malleable to whoever scares him 
most (first, Associate Vice President 
of Student Affairs Gary Ratcliff, sec-
ond, the Koala). 

Speaking of the Koala, Ben 
Hassine is destined to become a tar-
get. Though she maintained a ratio-
nal stance during Gupta’s student-
media funding freeze in February 
(if boycotting important committee 
meetings can be considered ratio-
nal), she harbors an exceptional 
hatred of the controversial paper. A 
heat-of-the-moment, Gupta-esque 
reaction to kill the Koala wouldn’t 
be uncharacteristic. Ben Hassine 
would be wiser to direct the council 
toward more constructive efforts to 
battle racial insensitivity. 

Another top priority this year 
will be training student representa-
tives on campuswide committees 
to inform themselves on the topics 
at hand and report back to council 
regularly. Ben Hassine, herself, has 
had problems on such committees 
— mainly with attendance and not 
getting the word out fast enough 
to rouse a student army. One more 
sure path to empowering students 
from the ground up would be to fol-
low the campaign promises of presi-
dential candidates John Condello 
and Tan Dhillon, who advocated the 
publicizing of student rights and a 
system to keep RSOs in check.

But, like we said, priority No. 1 
for councilmembers is tossing aside 
campaign paraphernalia and finding 
common ground. With a council as 
divided as Gupta’s and a president 
without his singlehanded ability to 
lift projects off the ground, next 
year’s A.S. hamsters will have no 
chance of finding their way off the 
wheel.

On April 3, Wikileaks.org leaked Apache helicopter footage that 
revealed U.S. soldiers gunning down 
two supposed insurgents — who actu-
ally turned out to be journalists with 
cameras, two RPGs and Ak-47s — 
and all those unfortunate enough to 
be the line of fire.

The tragic mistake, aggravated 
by  crude commentary such as “Oh 
yeah, look at those dead bastards” and  
“All you gotta do is 
pick up a weapon,” 
is a window into 
the training tactics 
used by the U.S. 
The callous remarks 
make it clear that 
some soldiers think 
of war as one big 
video game. 

Indeed, games 
such as America’s 
Army, Modern 
Warfare and Call 
of Duty have been 
used to train soldiers and help them 
deal with combat trauma. But in a 
video game, no matter how many 
ruthless rounds are shot, reality can 
always be reset with the click of a but-
ton — not an option on the battlefield. 

A civilian can only imagine the 
psychological toll warfare must 
take on a soldier. But when war is 
desensitized to the point that the line 
between reality and fiction is blurred, 
the value of a human life is compro-
mised. 

Not only has the boyish eagerness 
to pull a trigger has compromised 
our country’s public image, it has led 
to the indiscriminate slaughtering of 
innocent lives.

Obviously, video-game military training isn’t a vestibule of 
human sympathy, as demonstrated 
by the recent video leak of a few 
helicopter-perched U.S. soldiers gun-
ning down a group of journalists from 
a helicopter. 

However, the soldiers in question 
can’t be faulted for simply following 
orders — even if their humanism 
doesn’t translate very well to YouTube.

In the now-
infamous clip, 
soldiers discuss 
whether or not the 
insurgent group is 
armed, and fire only 
after it is confirmed 
the group is non-
American. 

The screams of 
jubilation from the 
soldiers are unset-
tling, but let’s face it: 
Soldiers are trained 
to kill. If a soldier 

were squeamish, or took too long to 
consult his conscience, he wouldn’t 
make a very good fighter — and could 
potentially endanger his squadron.

It’s not all ruthless violence, either. 
At the end of the video, members of 
the U.S. army are seen rushing to the 
scene to pick up wounded children. 
The children were originally inside a 
van, obscured from view — but, upon 
their discovery, soldiers are quick to 
help them. 

Though a video depicting a violent 
shooting is never pleasant, the latest 
from Iraq is no Abu Ghraib — just a 
display of tactlessness from soldiers 
who were following ruthless direc-
tions.

Office of the President.” 
Dominguez said the incident was a form of vir-

tual civil disobedience, a part of the body of work that 
Dominguez was both known and hired for at UCSD 
in 2005.

Dominguez said that university officials had been 
informally investigating him since January for his involve-
ment in creating a cell-phone application that helps illegal 
immigrants safely cross the U.S. border with Mexico by 
leading them to fresh water and other forms of aid.

According to Dominguez, the university has threat-
ened to strip him of his tenure. Tenure allows profes-
sors extra job security by requiring just cause before 
their contracts can be terminated.

Upon request from the UCOP, Assistant Vice 
Chancellor of UCSD Audit & Management Advisory 
Services Stephanie Burke scheduled a meeting with 
Dominguez on April 8 to investigate his involvement 
in the March 4 Virtual Sit-In.

A small group of protesters accompanied 
Dominguez to the meeting, where he asked the crowd 
whether or not he should go inside. 

According to Dominguez, the consensus was that 
he should delay the meeting until he had consulted a 
lawyer.

“The community said we could either hold this meet-
ing outside with these 200 people present as witnesses, 
or we would have to wait until I had legal counsel,” 
Dominguez said. “We agreed to postpone the meeting.”

Warren College senior and visual-arts student Holly 
Eskew asked the American Civil Liberties Union  to 
become involved in Dominguez’s case. She said ACLU 
attorneys plan to review Dominguez’s case this week, 
and will determine how the UCOP investigation relates 
to free speech.

Dominguez’ cell-phone app has received additional 
scrutiny from other sources. Earlier this month, three 
congressmen — Rep. Duncan Hunter (R–Calif.), Rep. 
Brian Bilbray (R–Calif.) and Rep. Darrell Issa (R–Calif.) 
— drafted an open letter to Chancellor Marye Anne Fox 
earlier this month, urging her to stop supplying univer-
sity funds for Dominguez’s project.

“The issue is with the actual technology he is 
working to create,” Joe Kasper, Hunter’s spokesman, 
said. “It’s problematic to Congressman Hunter for two 
reasons: One is that its sole purpose is to help foreign 
nationalities illegally cross the U.S.-Mexico border, 
and two is that its being funded by tax-payer dollars. 
The university can step forward and stop acting as a 
platform to help propel the technology forward, which 
is what seems to be the case right now.”

Dominguez said he does not plan to alter or post-
pone the cell-phone project.

“The researchers and myself deeply believe in its 
conceptual frame — we believe that art is not a crime,” 
Dominguez said. “We also believe that it is important 
to bring to the foreground the crisis that is part of the 
border, and to hold accountable those communities 
that just let people die in an unconsidered way. As long 
as the project continues to work in that way, we do not 
see why it should not continue.”

Eskew said the visual-arts community will stand 
behind Dominguez throughout the investigation.

“We are standing behind him in terms of the value 
of his work, and as an individual,” Eskew said.

date is eliminated, that vote is transferred 
to the second-ranked candidate, and so on. 

Gupta — running for reelection on his 
self-created NOW! slate — received the 
most No. 1  ranked votes of all seven candi-

dates. He had 1,153, compared 
to Ben Hassine’s 1,106. Gupta 
led Ben Hassine 
in every round of 
the elimination 
except the final 
one, in which 465 

votes were transferred to Ben 
Hassine — giving her a total 
of 1,991 votes, compared to 
Gupta’s 1,713.

Ben Hassine, who ran on the 
Students First slate, said the win 
came as a surprise to her. 

“This was such a hotly con-
tested election that the entire 
time we were in the dark,” she 
said. “We didn’t know how 
we were doing, and everyone 
had different opinions about 
who was going to win. I didn’t 
expect it, and I had prepared 
myself not to win and made 
plans for next year if I didn’t.”

She added that the STV 
voting system was a fair indi-
cator of student preferences. 

“It’s like a thermometer,” Ben Hassine 
said. “With the STV system, there’s no binary 
of ‘yes’ or ‘no’, since the voters can rank on 
what they want.”

Gupta said he was disappointed about 
the loss, but agreed that the results showed 
a clear preference.

“A loss is a loss, and you have to learn 
to swallow them,” Gupta said. “Whether or 
not it reaffirms [my actions as president] 
or not, I don’t think it really speaks to 
those types of actions. It just speaks to who 
had the best ideas for next year and who 
can get the vote out, and I think the answer 

is obvious tonight. It’s Wafa.”
The Tritons First slate — led by current 

Thurgood Marshall College Senator Brian 
McEuen, who came in third for president 
— swept a majority of the executive and 
senatorial positions. Tritons First candi-
date Andrew Ang won the vice president 
of finance and resources position, while 

Michael Lam, also of Tritons 
First, took vice president of 
external affairs. 

Additionally, Tritons First 
candidates Anish Bhayani, 
Adriana Garcia, Michael 
Raimondi, Zoe Seher and 
Jennifer Tzi won five of the 
eight campuswide senatorial 
positions. 

McEuen said he was pleased 
his slate took so many spots 
despite losing the presidency.

“If a majority of my slate 
won and I didn’t, that’s fine 
with me,” McEuen said. “And 
we did great tonight.”

McEuen said that he would 
likely not be involved in the 
student council next year.

“[Ben Hassine] has good 
counsel,” McEuen said. “I hope 
she listens to them, because 
that didn’t happen last year.”

From the Students First slate, 
Deyna Roberson, Victor Flores and Adriana 
Garcia won campuswide senatorial positions. 
Ben Hassine said it was unfortunate that no 
Students First vice-presidential candidates 
would be joining her, but that it would not 
affect the performance of the council.

Independent presidential candidate and 
Thurgood Marshall College Council Chair 
Tan Dhillon, who came in fifth, said that he 
planned to continue his involvement in A.S. 
Council.

“I’m not done with A.S.,” he said. “I’m 
planning to come back as associate vice 
president.” 

Associate vice presidents are appointed 
by the time the new council assumes office 
during Week Seven. 

Sixth College Senator and presidential 
hopeful John Condello — who placed 
fourth after running independently — said 
he was “super happy”  with Ben Hassine’s 
victory. 

“I think she’s experienced, she’s ide-
alistic and hopefully she can appoint 
everybody that can help accomplish her 
goals — and I’m glad Utsav didn’t win,” 
Condello said.

He added that he’d like to see Ben Hassine 
take a firmer stance on many issues.

“[I’d advise her] to not be so politically 
correct and make sure that she can speak 
her mind more often, and not worry so 
much about offending people,” he said.

Independent presidential candidates Joe 
Virgilio and August Ryan Brenner were not 
present at the election announcements. 

The results were delayed for two hours 
while the A.S. Elections Committee discussed 
three election separate greviances — two of 
which were filed against the Tritons First 
slate and the other against Gupta. 

According to A.S. Elections Manager 
Vishal Kotcherlakota, student voter turnout 
was 22.7 percent — down from 24.3 percent 
last year. Marshall College boasted the highest 
college turnout at 25.3 percent, and Warren 
College had the lowest, at 21.1 percent.

“I’m happy that it was a competitive 
race this year,” Kotcherlakota said. “There 
was a diverse group of turnout, which is 
what a legitimate A.S. election needs.”

Ben Hassine said that her first priorities 
will be to appoint associate vice presidents 
and charter a committee to start determin-
ing the 2010-11 executive budget.

A fter almost two years of upset, the “cancer cluster” at the UCSD Literature Building seems to have finally faded from interest. The literature department has 
expressed its wish to close the case for good 
after three separate studies failed to pinpoint 
the cause of the cluster — and after university 
officials worked with the Building Committee 
to implement several cautionary measures.

“The reports confirmed to us that, as far 
as we know, the building is safe,” Literature 
Department Chair Oumelbanine Zhiri said. 
“Because of that, the elevators are back to nor-
mal. Life is back to normal.”

An unusually high incidence of can-
cer among staff and faculty working in the 
Literature Building — eight cases between 
2000 and 2008 — has been the source of public 
scrutiny since early 2007. 

Panic among those with offices in the 
building was heightened by a June 2008 report 
by UCSD professor and epidemiologist Cedric 
Garland, who pointed to electromagnetic 
fields (EMFs) being emitted from the build-
ing’s elevator equipment as a possible cause 
of cancer. (Garland had also investigated a 
possible cluster in the Chancellor’s Complex.) 
According to his report, the likelihood that the 
building’s cancer rate was caused by chance 
alone was one in 3,333.

As a result, two elevators in the Literature 
Building were temporarily shut down, and 
staff were vacated from offices with suspected 
high exposure to the EMFs. 

In February 2009, about 100 depart-
ment affiliates — some carrying a coffin 
down Library Walk — staged a dem-

VIN DE SYRAH

SITESEEN I nspired by the whimsy aesthetic of “Alice in Wonderland,” Vin de Syrah Spirit and Wine Parlor in downtown 
San Diego’s Gaslamp Quarter is an under-
ground lounge worthy of its “eat me”s and 
“drink me”s.

Prove you’re of age to a moustached 
man behind a velvet rope on the corner 
of Fifth Avenue and E Street and you’ll be 
permitted to descend down a question-
able subway-stop stairwell. At this point, 
it’s impossible to tell you’re just steps away 
from the entrance to SD’s trendiest water-
ing hole. Look for an inconspicuous gold 
handle jutting from of an ivy-covered wall, 
and — once you’ve made it inside — make 
your way to the left. The right side’s plush, 
oversized booths are reserved for bottle 
service, which will cost you about $300.

It’s impossible not to gawk at Syrah’s 
décor: white, porcelain parasols are sus-
pended from the ceiling, and warm wax 
candles dangle from mangled tree roots. 
The front door’s floor-to-ceiling ivy 
spreads over the inside wall as well, inter-
rupted here and there by butterfly- and 
moss-adorned brick and wallpapered for-
est.

Most impressive is an oversized table 
for 12 where wine tastings are held every 
Friday and Saturday — suitable for vino 
virgins and winos alike — just sit back, 
close your eyes and imagine your somme-
lier is mad and your drink is a very strong 
tea.

Of course, given it was recently dubbed 
a “hotspot” by Yelp, Syrah becomes more 
crowded than Geisel on finals week by 10 
p.m. Not surprising, considering the list of 
cocktails and wines could take you years 
to conquer. The bar even offers the elusive 
Chimay — a fruity ale brewed by Belgian 
monks — and a more welcoming air than 
the other bourgie wine joints in town.

The best time 
to score a phone 
number is post-10 
p.m., when the 
deejays’ house 

beats and top-40 mashups provide an 
ample soundtrack for scoping eye candy, 
while the French Gewurztraminer provides 
you the liquid courage to approach. 

For the best service on the other hand, 
arrive during Syrah’s happy hour — 4 p.m. 
to 8 p.m. — for $5 sangria specials. Or, 
show up with a group and split a bottle 
of wine. (Most are in the $30 range, but 
they can go from $22 for a domestic 
Pinot Grigio to $140 for a 2002 Cabernet 
Sauvignon.)

If you’re not a wine drinker, not to 
worry: Syrah doubles as a spirit parlor. 
Try scratch-made specialty drinks like the 
Caprese Martini — complete with cucum-
ber, basil and sundried tomatoes — or the 
Gaslamp Lady, a sweeter, more palatable 
lime, grapefruit and cayenne pepper rim.

onstration, arguing that the university’s 
response was insufficient. Demonstrators 
presented Chancellor Marye Anne Fox with 
a petition with 1,300 signatures that called 
for immediate action, including a relocation 
of the literature department.

In May 2009, some classes were moved 
into Sixth College trailers, and some faculty 
chose to hold office hours at on-campus 
cafes or in the Cross-Cultural Center.

One participating student, who asked 
to remain anonymous, said the university 
should have at least evacuated the building 
while the studies were being conducted.

“I was most upset because — even if the 
evidence was inconclusive — the university 
was really slow to find new classrooms,” 
he said. “I stayed in that building all year. 
The whole department was concerned. It 
was disrespectful and irresponsible for the 
university to not find an alternative place. It 
seemed like the well-being of the students 
and staff wasn’t important.”

Environmental Health and Safety 
Director Stephen Benedict decided to hire 
UCLA epidemiologist Leeka Kheifets to 
investigate EMF levels in the building. 
Though Kheifets admitted that building 
employees showed an unusually high inci-
dence of breast cancer and recommended 
further investigation, her July 2009 report 
concluded EMF levels were low. Kheifets 
pointed out that epidemiological evidence 
does not support an association between 
EMF and breast cancer in the first place.

The report also recommended that the 
building be equipped with air conditioning 
to reduce humidity that would allow for the 
growth of molds and fungi.

According to department chair Zhiri, 
the completion of the air-conditioning sys-
tem will be the final step in the university’s 
public agreement with the staff and faculty.

“We feel that the administration has 
done what was agreed upon to do,” he said.

Ninyo & Moore, a geotechnical and 
environmental sciences firm, was hired 
by university officials to perform a chem-
ical-trace analysis of air samples in the 
Literature Building. The firm tested for 
various air-quality parameters, including 

temperature, relative humidity, carbon-
monoxide levels, carbon-dioxide levels, 
ultra-fine particles and a broad spectrum of 
volatile organic analytes.

The firm released a report in December 
2009 concluding that it “could not find 
evidence to corroborate a health concern. 
… Based on all of the findings mentioned 
above, no further action is recommended 
concerning further specialized investiga-
tion of indoor air quality in the Literature 
Building at this time.”

According to Building Committee 
Chair and literature professor Roddey Reid, 
though the air-conditioning installation 
was expected to be finished by the end of 
Winter Quarter, the process was delayed 
partly due to the chemical-trace study, and 
he now expects the installation to be com-
pleted by the end of Spring Quarter.

The installation of air conditioning 
throughout the Literature Building — a 
project expected to cost over $100,000 
— was one of five possible solutions pro-
posed in September 2010 by the Building 
Committee to “improve the workplace envi-
ronment.” The committee also proposed 
that the university initiate a toxicological 
study, make improvements to ventilation in 
the elevator room and replace the elevator’s 
hydraulic oil with soy-based vegetable oil — 
all of which have been completed.

A February 2010 study performed 
by the Field Management Services 
Corporation to measure the magnitude 
and vector direction of the elevator’s power 
frequency magnetic fields concluded that 
magnetic-field levels throughout occupied 
areas of the building were not unsafe. 

“We are reasonably confident that right 
now the building is clean, or as clean as can 
be ascertained by science,” Reid said. “What 
it is for us to have all these mitigation mea-
sures, it [has] allowed the department and 
its members to resume normal operations. 
It’s been very disruptive of us as an academ-
ic unit, and has allowed people to move on 
from this very trying experience in the way 
of health issues.”

10 THE UCSD GUARDIAN� MONDAY, APRIL 12, 2010� FOCUS

ertarians living in a declared state of war 
against Mexico since 1994, using nonviolent 
avenues like the Internet to spread their mes-
sage.

Dominguez partnered with the group in 
1994, leading to their joint 1998 invention of 
an online tool called Virtual Sit-In. The tech-
nology allows protesters to flood and poten-
tially take down certain Web sites.

Most recently — in a move that now has 
the UC Office of the President questioning 
Dominguez’ employment — the professor 
employed Virtual Sit-In on the UCOP Web 
site on March 4, allowing individuals to 
protest online during the Day of Action to 
Defend Public Education.

Before that, in November 2009, 
Dominguez created a Web site nearly identi-
cal to the current UCOP Web site, announc-
ing that a new “Zero Tuition” program was to 
be employed by the UC system. Several news 
outlets called in, believing the statement to 
be real.

Dominguez was also involved in the cre-
ation of a mock UCOP Web page announc-
ing the resignation of UC President Mark G. 
Yudof.

Virtual Sit-In uses an HTML-based pro-
gram to target specific Web sites. For each 
individual that signs in to join the protest, the 
targeted Web site is forced to refresh — clog-
ging the server and eventually preventing its 
use, just as if it were a real location filled with 
protesters.

“Electronic civil disobedience allows us 
to think about the question of art becom-
ing a social manifestation, allows us to think 
about art allowing communities who do not 
have access to power to make themselves 
present and allows the unbearable weight of 
human beings to put a stop to the crisis that is 
around us — especially the juicy crisis of edu-
cation,” Dominguez said. “It allows us to see 
that art is an active space in public culture, 
and that it cannot be disregarded.”

Warren College senior Holly Eskew, a for-
mer student of Dominguez, said she partici-
pated in both the physical and virtual protests 
that took place on March 4.

“About 400 of us did the Virtual Sit-In, 
and at the same time, we had our real bodies 

protesting,” Eskew said. “We are reaching the 
time when we can compare our real bodies 
to our digital bodies and online environ-
ment.”

Dominguez was hired into the UCSD visu-
al-arts department in 2005, specifically for his 
work in electronic civil disobedience. Since 
then, he has become involved with CalIT2, 
acting as director of the b.a.n.g. laboratory 
— a group of students and faculty who use 
modern technology to construct social and 
political statements. 

“Art is as important as science or engineer-
ing or philosophy,” Dominguez said. “Art is 
a space that allows us to expand the way that 
we can think of the future. This is a product 
not of activism, and not a product of politics, 
not a product of science — it is the outcome 
of artistic investigation.”

While much of Dominguez’ recent 
work utilizes the Internet, he has experi-
mented with a wide range of artistic media. 
Dominguez began studying classical theater 
in the early 1980s, later moving on to agitprop 
theatre — a type of politically driven perfor-
mance drawn from the terms “agitation” and 
“propaganda.” 

“In the early ’80s, I became interested 
in thinking about the future of theater,” 
Dominguez said. “I began to theorize new 
forms of electronic theater, and we wrote a 
series of books — one called The Electronic 
Disturbance and another book called 
Electronic Civil Disobedience.”

From there, Dominguez moved to New 
York City to begin forming a body of research 
that would eventually lead him to work with 
the Zapatistas.

“I started working with the Zapatistas in 
developing an intercontinental network of 
struggle and resistance,” Dominguez said. 
“We initiated the practice of electronic civil 
disobedience and electronic action in 1998, 
and there, we did a series of performances 
for the Department of Defense, Congress and 
many other communities who responded to 
the issue of civil disobedience as an area of 
interest and dialogue.”

Since his recruitment by UCSD in 2005, 
Dominguez has significantly expanded upon 
the breadth of technologies he involves in his 
art, as exhibited by his involvement in *par-

ticle group* — a group of poets, new-media 
artists and sound artists who are interested in 
“poetically” investigating the nature of toxic-
ity in unregulated products that use nano-
technology, especially nanosilver.

Nanotechnology uses particles on the 
atomic scale that can often create new com-
pounds — which may, in turn, be toxic. One 
of *particle group*’s core projects has been 
the creation of a piece of equipment that acts 
as a “particle sniffer.”

“It allows you to walk through the instal-
lation, sniffs you and then tells you the level 
of toxicity in your body because you’ve been 
using, say, Maybelline lipstick or transpar-
ent suntan lotion,” Dominguez said. “The 
response by the sniffer is a series of poetic 
scannings of your body. That’s the core vision 
of the *particle group*.”

Dominguez said that his projects, whether 
oncampus or nationwide, always rely on the 
contributions of fellow artists and activists.

“Collaboration is at the core of the perfor-
mative matrix that I do, with all the different 
groups I work with,” he said.

Eskew said that the close attention 
Dominguez pays to his students is truly an 
asset to the visual-arts department.

“He is equal-handed in the way that he 
gives to his students and his projects,” Eskew 
said. “He happens to be one of the most spec-
tacular lecturers, and the most giving, caring 
professor I have ever come across.”

Crew Team Holds Strong in Newport Beach
By Liam Rose
Associate Sports Editor

WOMEN’S CREW — Finally start-
ing to come together as a group, the 
UCSD women’s crew team turned in 
promising results this weekend at its 
last regatta before conference cham-
pionships.

At the Berg Cup in Newport 
Beach on April 10, the Tritons’ nov-
ice four-boat crossed the finish line 
in first place. Earlier, the varsity 
eight-boat finished fourth after being 
narrowly edged out by UC Santa 
Barbara. The novice eight-boat only 
finished fourth after being forced to 
overcome an official’s mistake at the 
start of the race.

In the varsity eight race, the 
University of San Diego pulled away 
early, leaving UCSB and host Orange 
Coast College to battle for second 
place. UCSB fought back and forth 
with the Tritons throughout the 
middle of the race, but managed to 
pull ahead in the final sprint to take 
second.

Nevertheless, senior captain Jesi 

Bennett said she was impressed with 
her team’s ability to hold up against 
stiff competition. 

“It was a good one,” Bennet said. 
“We haven’t been losing by a whole 
lot, but we haven’t been jelling as a 
group. We’re finally doing what we 
need to do personally in order to 
do well.”

She said the Tritons’ success can 
be attributed to a strengthening of 
their chemistry.

“Even though we’re supposed to 
row as a boat instead of eight indi-
viduals, we’ve refocused on the fact 
that we all have a personal duty to 
make the boat go faster in a more 
efficient way,” Bennett said. 

The Tritons were set behind in 
the novice eight race before they 
even started moving. While the start-
er is required to wait for each crew to 
ready itself before starting the race, 
the official failed to notice that the 
Triton boat was chalked on a buoy, 
and began the race anyway.

As a result, the Tritons faced a 
severe disadvantage, but were still 
able to keep their composure and 

finish the race strong. 
The novice four race went much 

more smoothly: The boat earned 
UCSD’s only outright victory of the 
day.

“I am very proud of them,” head 
coach Pattie Pinkerton said. “It was 
a very strong field. They came from 
behind and rode with quite a bit of 
poise to take the race.”

UCSD’s final race will be at the 
conference championships in three 
weeks.

Pinkerton said she is hopeful after 
her squad’s performance on Saturday. 

“We’ve had a race plan, and we’ve 
been struggling with executing it,” 
Pinkerton said. “But we’re very 
happy that all the things we’ve been 
working toward are starting to come 
together.”

Leading up to championships 
the Tritons will race at the Western 
Intercollegiate Rowing Associate 
Championships on May 1 to May 2 
in Sacramento.

12 THE UCSD GUARDIAN� MONDAY, APRIL 12, 2010� SPORTS

Howe was one of only six Tritons 
to compete at UCLA’s invitational, 
a high-profile meet that features 
Division-I schools from across the 
country, as well as professional ath-
letes. Far from intimidated, Howe 
shattered his school record in the 
javelin throw by six feet with a mark 
of 220’ 6” to take the gold. The throw 
gave Howe the top mark in NCAA 
Division-II thus far this season.

 “When you’re [setting a personal 
best] by six feet, it’s really excep-
tional,” Salerno said. “Him just being 
a sophomore shows there’s really no 
top end for him.”

Also competing at UCLA was 
senior hurdler Christine Merrill, who 
ran both the 100- and 400-meter 
hurdles. She placed sixth and fourth 
in the events, respectively. Senior 
thrower Danielle Thu — redshirt-

ing this season and competing indi-
vidually — placed third in the ham-
mer throw while fellow senior Marie 
Archer placed fifth. Junior thrower 
Theresa Richards placed eighth in 
the javelin — an event won by former 
UCLA All-American Tara Ross. 

At Pomona-Pitzer, senior polee-
vaulter Donna LaFever won her 
event with a jump of 12’5.5”, earning 
a provisional Division-II qualifying 
mark that should send her to the 
national championships later this 
year.

Her sister, junior Stephanie 
LaFever, placed fourth in the 100 
hurdles and fifth in the high jump. 
The younger LaFever will be one 
of several Tritons competing at the 
Mt. Sac heptathlon/decathlon this 
Wednesday and Thursday.

On the men’s side, senior hur-
dler Leon Baham took third in the 

400-meter hurdles with a time of 
53.42, then placed sixth in the 110 
hurdles. Sophomore jumper Jeffrey 
Head placed third in the long jump 
with a mark of 21’ 11.5.” 

In the first national poll of the 
season — released on April 6 — the 
Triton women were ranked No. 2 in 
Division-II, while the men stood No. 
13 overall.

UCSD now boasts a total of 18 
marks — including two national 
bests — ranking it in the top-10 
Division II schools this season.

“We’re excited about both teams,” 
Salerno said. “But the men’s team has 
really stepped up recently.”

The Tritons return to action 
on April 17 at the Soka Peace 
Invitational, held in Aliso Viejo.

WORLD FAMOUS HAMBURGERS

By Liam Rose
Associate Sports Editor

TRACK AND FIELD — In case there 
were any doubts, the UCSD’s track-
and-field athletes used last weekend 
to reaffirm they are some of the best 
to ever pull on a Triton uniform. 

Junior sprinter Kelly Fogarty, 
senior distance runner Daniel 
Anderson and sophomore thrower 
Nick Howe all improved on their 
own school record, highlighting a 
lively weekend for the entire team. 
Howe traveled with a small Triton 
contingent to the Rafer Johnson/
Jackie Joyner-Kersee Invitational at 
UCLA, while Fogerty, Anderson and 
the rest of the team competed at the 
Pomona-Pitzer Invitational. 

Fogarty bested her records in 
both the 100- and 200-meter dash, 
clocking a time of 11.74 in the for-
mer and 24.12 in the latter. The 
times earned her first and second 
in the events, respectively, as she 
was surpassed only by Republic of 
Chad sprinter Kaltouma Nadjina in 
the 200. 

“It’s pretty amazing,” said head 
coach Tony Salerno. “When you’re 
running 12-flat or a little under it’s 
pretty fast, but when you get down 
to the 11.7s, you’re running with 
the big girls. That 11.74 is really 
impressive.”

Anderson broke the school 
record in the 800 meters only two 
weeks before — at the Cal/Nevada 
Championships — but still managed 
to improve his mark with a victori-
ous time of 1:50.56.

history of the UCSD men’s basket-
ball team.

The final walk to the bench was 
bittersweet for Acevedo, who said he 
attributes much of his success to the 
people he played with throughout 
his collegiate career.

“It was mixed feelings — sad 
and happy,” Acevedo said. “I just sat 
there in my jersey, reflecting back 
on my career. I had a lot of great 
times. I just hugged my teammates, 
thanking them.”

But now, their collegiate careers 
behind them, Acevedo and Lawley 
are confronting the same dilemma 
all students face on the cusp of the 
real world: What next?

For both Triton standouts, the 
answer is, hopefully, a career in pro-
fessional basketball.

“I’m going to play basketball as 
long as I can,” Lawley said. “Just 
keep playing until my clock runs 
out.”

However, Lawley — who was 
named to the 2009-10 California 
Collegiate Athletic Association first 
team and led the league with a 
20.2 points-per-game average — 
acknowledged that the jump from 
UCSD to the European professional 
leagues would be a massive one.

Both he and Acevedo will be 
entering an elite pool of basketball 
talent. Although incomparable to 
the NBA, the international curcuit 
has a talent standard far above the 
Division-II NCAA.

Lawley said he recently hired an 
agent to help him score a spot in a 
European league, and is currently 
looking at professional leagues in 
Germany, Turkey, Australia and the 
Baltic countries.

But regardless of which league 
he ends up in, Lawley said his agent 
wants him to play in the first divi-
sion — against “the big boys” — 
a move that will require him to 
improve many aspects of his game, 

including his physique.
“I’m a little scared,” Lawley said. 

“I will have to change up my game 
and become either a [shooting 
guard] or a [point guard]. 

However, Lawley — who is cur-
rently training in the off-season to 
meet the increased demands of pro 
ball — said he remains sure of his 
abilities.

“It’s more a physical than a men-
tal issue,” Lawley said. “I think I can 
handle it mentally, but physically, I 
need to get my body 
stronger and faster 
in order to be able to 
play.”

Acevedo, who said 
he plans on explor-
ing opportunities in 
European and Puerto 
Rican leagues, will 
face similar challenges. 
But even if he doesn’t 
make a team, Acevedo 
said he knows he 
wants to stay involved 
in the sport, even if 
it means working in 
youth camps — like 
the LeBron James King’s Academy, 
which visited RIMAC Arena this 
past summer.

Lawley and Acevedo both said 
they have recieved full familial sup-
port for their decision to pursue pro-
fessional basketball careers; Lawley 
described his parents as “stoked” on 
the idea. Perhaps equally committed 
to their welfare is their mentor and 
coach of the last four years, head 
coach Chris Carlson.

“I have the confidence that I can 
play international ball,  but I’m just 
scared of going over there all by 
myself,” Lawley said. “I will be leav-
ing a lot of people behind.”

Both players were standout 
seniors in high school — Lawley at 
Tokay High School in Lodi, Calif., 
and Acevedo at Agoura High School 
in Agoura Hills, Calif. They had 

several options for playing ball in 
college, yet both chose UCSD — a 
school not especially well-known 
for its athletic program.

Lawley said there were three 
major pulls to becoming a Triton: 
the school’s academic prowess, La 
Jolla’s great weather and the caliber 
of people involved in the basketball 
program. 

“When I looked at the school, I 
saw a great group of guys,” Lawley 
said. “They made me feel welcome 

and want to play with 
them.”

After meeting the 
team and spending 
time with Carlson, 
the prospect of a blue-
and-gold Triton jersey 
became increasingly 
attractive.

Acevedo said 
that while success at 
UCSD was rarely easy 
to come by, he came 
out on top thanks in a 
large part to Carlson’s 
mentoring.

“There is less time 
to study, less time to freelance 
and less time to explore majors,” 
Acevedo said. “Coach was always 
telling us to manage time and keep 
up on our studies, and he really 
helped guide me and the rest of the 
players so we could handle basket-
ball and school.”

As many UCSD athletes can 
attest, Acevedo and Lawley have 
found the academic responsibilities 
that come with attending a top-
notch public university difficult to 
balance with a full-time athletic 
career. Student athletes must jug-
gle road games, home practice and 
workouts with their studies.

Because UCSD doesn’t hand out 
athletic scholarships, Carlson said 
there is added pressure on Triton 
athletes — obligated to perform 
highly both academically and ath-

letically while, in some cases, work-
ing a part-time job. 

“I try to stress success in the 
classroom to my athletes every day,” 
Carlson said. “Because they must 
be both exceptional athletes and 
exceptional students, I make sure 
they stay on top of tests, papers and 
all their other assignments.”

Under Carlson’s tutelage, 
Acevedo has already fulfilled the 
unit requirement for a degree in 
communications, and Lawley is fin-
ishing up his last quarter as an 
economics major. Both are set to 
graduate in spring.  

“Jordan and Tyler were both 
great guys,” Carlson said. “They had 
to balance school, work and basket-
ball, and they were extraordinary at 
it. I firmly believe that both of them 
will be successful beyond UCSD.”

In the more far-off future, Lawley 
and Acevedo said they plan to uti-
lize the education they received at 
UCSD to launch post-basketball 
careers.

Acevedo said he plans to cou-
ple  his degree in communications 
with experience in the pros to get 
involved in the business or coaching 
side of the sport.

Similarly, Lawley said he hopes 
to eventually pursue a career as a 
sports agent. He is currently look-
ing into a joint graduate program in 
business and law.

“I am going to take the LSAT 
soon,” Lawley said. “I want to be 
an agent. That will allow me to stay 
close to basketball even after I can’t 
play.”

Both Acevedo and Lawley said 
the fulfillment they derive from 
their sport greatly outweighs the 
stress of an uncertain future.

“Stress? Yeah there is some 
stress,” Acevedo said. “But I wouldn’t 
trade [basketball] for anything.”

W ith only 47 seconds left on the clock in UCSD’s season-ending 79-87 loss to Humboldt State 
on Feb. 26, senior guards Jordan Lawley 
and Tyler Acevedo walked to the bench for 
the last time in their Triton careers. They 
recieved a standing ovation from the RIMAC

With a familiar blast from the scoreboard 
buzzer — the same one that signaled the 
beginning of their careers four years ago —
