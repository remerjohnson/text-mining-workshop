SURF REPORT

University 
Centers Fee 
May Increase 
$39 Annually

BY NICOLE CHAN
Associate News Editor

In this month’s special election, 
students will be voting on a proposed $13 
fee increase to sustain University Centers, 
— which includes Price Center, the Student 
Center and the Che Cafe. 

According to a Feb. 8 presentation led 
by University Centers Interim Director 
Sharon Van Bruggen and John Hughes 
of the Student Life Business Office, the 
University Centers budget went into the 
red during the 2010-11 year. 

The proposed fee increase will go 
towards the essential maintenance and 
needed repairs of University Centers. 

“Without action, the budget will go 
into deficit and reserves will begin sliding 
to zero due to needed facility repairs and 
replacement projects,” Van Bruggen said in 
the presentation. 

Each student currently pays $76.50  per 
quarter for the University Centers fee. If 
the referendum is passed, students will pay 
$89.50 per quarter. 

According to Van Bruggen, the new 
fee is lower than university center fees 
for other UC campuses — students at UC 
Irvine pay $110 per quarter and students at 

STATE OF CALIFORNIA

BY ZEV HURWITZ
Associate News Editor

California Assembly Speaker John Perez has proposed legislation that would help middle-class students afford 
California state tuition.

Perez’s proposal, announced Feb. 8, 
would undo a 2009 tax break for out-of-state 
corporations that would help reduce tuition 
for certain students by up to two-thirds.

If passed by the legislature, UC students 
whose family income is too high to qualify for 
Cal Grants, but still below $150,000, would 
qualify to receive around $8,200 in tuition 
breaks annually. 

Cal State students in the same financial 
demographic would qualify for around 
$4,000. The cost of tuition, excluding housing 
and student fees, is around $12,000 a year at 
UC campuses and nearly $6,000 at Cal State 
schools.

“The pressures of the recession and 
massive fee increases have eroded, or even 
ended, the dream of higher education for 
too many California families,” Perez (D-Los 
Angeles) said in a statement. “Now it is time 
for our state to reinvest in our system of 
higher education. The California Middle Class 
Scholarship does that by closing a loophole 
for out-of-state corporations and slashing fees 
by two-thirds for thousands of California 
students.”

Announced in a video on 
middleclassscholarship.com, Perez’s proposal 
would end tax loopholes for corporations that 
cost the state $1 billion every year. 

The new scholarship fund would assist an 
estimated 42,000 UC students and 150,000 
Cal State students. Community colleges would 
also receive an increase in funding of around 

$150 million.
“California is on the mend,” Perez said. 

“And one of the best ways we can help 
that continue is enacting the Middle Class 

Scholarship and helping reclaim the promise 
of higher education as an economic engine for

ENROLLMENT 

BY LAIRA MARTIN
Associate News Editor

A two-pass registration system 
will be implemented for students for 
Fall Quarter 2012 registration, the 
Office of the Registrar announced in a 
universitiy-wide email on Feb. 10. 

The two-pass system will require 
students to register at two different 
times; they can enroll in up to 11.5 
units during the first pass, and then up 
to 19.5 units during the second pass. 

Students can enroll in up to 22 units 
on the first day of instruction. 

Waitlists will not be available during 
the first pass to encourage students to 
fully enroll in at least two classes. 

Additionally, students that 
fail to enroll during their first pass 

appointment must wait until their 
second pass appointment to enroll. 

“This gives all undergraduates a 
better chance to obtain at least two 
classes toward fulfilling requirements,” 
the Office of the Registrar wrote in the 
email.   

The range of registration times 
will also be expanded, 7 a.m. to 11 
p.m. Monday through Friday, with 
appointments on Saturdays as well. 

“I think it’ll be frustrating for 
juniors and seniors who’ve been 
gaining credits to get better enrollment 
times,” Marshall College sophomore 
Courtney Bakas said. “[They] won’t 
be able to get all the classes they need 
at once but on the other hand I think 
it’ll make registration more fair for the 
whole school population.”

Other UC schools, including UC 
Berkeley, UCLA and UC Davis already 
use a two-pass registration system. 

UC Santa Cruz implements a two-
pass system for all undergraduates that 
have non-senior status while UC Santa 
Barbara has a three-pass system. 

“I really appreciate the two-
pass registration system,” UCLA 
sophomore Jerry Ciolino said. “As an 
underclassmen it can be really hard 
to get classes you really need or want. 
With the two-pass system you have a 
better chance of getting those classes 
because enrollment is spread out a little 
bit more over all the undergraduate 
students.”

our state.”
UC President Mark G. Yudof 

released a statement in which he 
applauded the proposal and said 
that affordable tuition for all 
students was a priority.

“As we work with the governor 
and legislators on fiscal and 
policy issues that would affect the 
affordability of a UC education, we 
welcome constructive efforts such 
as the speaker’s proposal to provide 
middle-class tuition relief,” Yudof 
said in the statement.

In order for the proposal — 
which is divided into bills AB 
1500 and AB 1501 — to pass, the 
California legislature would need 
‘yes’ votes from two-thirds of both 

the Assembly and the Senate.

Republican leader Bob Huff 
released a statement Feb. 8 that 
urged Democrats to seek other ways 
to help finance education besides 

raising taxes.
“Republicans have long argued 

that the low income students are 
heavily subsidized and that the UC 
and Cal State are relative bargains 
for the more affluent students,” he 
said in the statement. “Let’s first 
enact the Governor’s pension 
reforms and balance the state 
budget then we can better assess 
the need for changes in tax policy 
and higher education.”

Based on the current

legislators, several Republicans 
would need to support the legislation 
in order to ensure passage.

According to a 2010 facilities 

condition analysis conducted 
by ISES Corporation, essential 
maintenance and repairs to Price 
Center are estimated to cost around 
$6.4 million. 

This includes $2.6 million for 
Student Center, $722,000 to the Che 
Cafe and about $4.5 million for 
required renovations for each of the 
facilities.

Operational expenses and 
maintenance include the stocking of 
Price Center’s restrooms, printing 
supplies, heating and cooling and 
trash collection. 

According to the presentation, 
the $13 fee increase will allow for 
continued building maintenance 
and  24-hour access Sunday through 
Thursday to Price Center East. 

The fee would also help maintain 
low-use fees for meeting and events 
sponsored by student organizations 
and A.S. Council. 

If the referendum passes, the 
new university centers fee will go 
into effect during Fall Quarter 2012. 

The fee will be adjusted annually 
beginning Fall Quarter 2013 to 
account for inflation and consumer 
price index. 

According to the presentation, 
annual adjustment will not exceed 

2 percent. 
The quarterly $13 fee increase 

and consumer price index 
adjustment is expected to yield over 
$20 million during the next 20 years 
for University Centers. 

The University Centers 
Advisory Board, which is composed 
of undergraduate and graduate 
students and Van Bruggen, will be 
responsible for overseeing the fee.

4 THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  MONDAY, FEBRUARY 13,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

Researchers at University of California, San Francisco concluded that sugar is “toxic,” and recommended that it be regulated like tobacco and alcohol. 
They bring up a good point: eating too much sugar causes obesity, and with 
roughly 70 percent of Americans considered overweight (having a BMI larger 
than 25), it would be wise for individuals to change their unhealthy habits. 
However, using government regulations to manipulate people’s sugar intake is 
a strategy that has proven time and time again to be ineffective.

Modest regulations on sugar repeatedly prove ineffective at curbing 
obesity. Several studies have shown that school bans on soda vending 
machines did little to change kids’ diets. When soda was no longer available at 
school, students satisfied their sweet tooth with other unhealthy treats.

According to a 2004 study funded by the federal government and the 
Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, taxes on soda are ineffective at improving 
health. The national survey followed 7,300 fifth graders for two years, 
recording their heights, weights and overall soda and sports drink intakes. 
When comparing children in states with different soda taxes, there appeared 
to be no difference. This governmental research, therefore, shows that taxes 
pose no significant barrier to those who are determined to get their soda fix.

The only solutions that gleam promising results are far too heavy-handed 
and intrusive. Some states like New York proposed placing a hefty 20 percent 
tax on sugar, and a Feb. 1 article “Public Health: The Toxic Truth About 
Sugar” in the science journal Nature suggests applying age limits and price 
controls to sugary products.

Based on past governmental health efforts, imposing a sugar regulation 
will prove fruitless in making kids healthier.

Government Regulation on Sugar Will Prove Ineffective Sugar Taxes Would Be a Step Toward Healthier Lives

A team of researchers at the University of California, San Francisco contends that because sugar poses health risks far beyond just 
“empty calories,” Americans should substantially reduce their sugar 
consumption by making sugar beverages a controlled substance like 
alcohol and tobacco. Their research shows that the country as a whole 
should take major strides to reduce our sugar intake, especially when it 
comes to soda.

The reasons why sugar consumption is such an issue are apparent in 
the facts. The average adult in the United States swallows 22 teaspoons 
— over 600 calories — of sugar a day, according to the American Heart 
Association. In the last 40 years, our sugar consumption has increased 
by about 19 percent. Beyond its calories, sugar has a host of negative 
health effects. A little sugar is not a problem — but excess sugar can alter 
metabolism, raise blood pressure, skew the signaling of hormones and 
damage the liver. When we consume calories from liquids, our bodies do 
not feel as full, so we down extra calories from sugar as a result.

Because sugar beverages have particularly insidious health 
consequences, they should be the first to be regulated. Other countries, 
including France, Denmark, and Greece, have soda taxes. Penny-per-
ounce taxes on sweet drinks are currently being considered in at least 20 
U.S. cities and states. The intention in adding this tax is to make healthier 
drinks less expensive than soda in order to encourage a change in diet. 
While we may still have cravings for ice cream or chocolate chip cookies 
every now and then, regulating soda is a step toward cutting back on our 
excess sugar consumption.

If you’re looking to make a quick buck off your class notes, you may soon be in for an unpleasant surprise if UC Berkeley’s 
recent policy change spreads to other UC 
campuses. Updated last month, the flagship 
campus’ policy on note-sharing prohibits 
students from selling their notes outside of 
the classroom, citing that instructors own the 
copyrights to the notes students take in their 
classes. The new changes not only infringe 
upon students’ rights — they also represent 
a step away from the “open” university 
movement that characterizes UC Berkeley.

Under the new policy, students can only 
share notes with other students who are 
enrolled in the same class at the same time. 
This means that students will be subject to 
disciplinary action for sharing old notes 
with students currently enrolled in that 
class. The policy most notably bans note-
selling, dubbing the practice “unauthorized 
commercial activity.”

California State University campuses have 
also been cracking down on note-sharing 
policies. In fall 2010, the Cal State Office 
of General Counsel sent out a system-wide 
email warning students that if they are caught 

selling notes, they will be charged with 
academic dishonesty — with the possibility 
of expulsion. At Chico State, a student was 
sent to judicial affairs after she advertised a 
self-created study guide on Notehall.com, 
a note-sharing site owned by the textbook 
rental company Chegg. Both Cal State and 
UC administration have sent cease-and-
desist letters to Notehall, causing the site to 
close off its services to students who attempt 
to register with Cal State or UC emails.  

While professors own intellectual 
property rights over the notes, books, and 
articles they publish, they do not technically 
wield any legal control over what students 
write in class. When students take notes, they 
rephrase and filter the professor’s words to 
facilitate their own comprehension of lecture 
material. Students also tend to include their 
own observations and inferences in their 
notes. As long as the notes are not written 
verbatim, professors cannot cry copyright 
infringement.

The constitutionality of this new policy is 
tenuous at best. The United State Congress — 
and not the states — have exclusive control 
over copyright and patent laws. Assistant 

clinical professor of law at UC Berkeley Jason 
M. Schultz maintains that federal copyright 
laws and the First Amendment right of free 
speech prevail over the California Education 
Code. Schultz argues that it is considered 
freedom of speech if students want to share 
their notes. Furthermore, as defined by Title 
17, Section 101 of the United States Code, a 
“derivative work” is not considered copyright 
infringement. Such works are defined as 
being based on pre-existing works, including 
those that are “recast, transformed or 
adapted.” UC Berkeley’s policy errs in that it 
treats students’ notes as direct transcriptions 
of professors’ words. Lecture notes — being 
a student’s own rendering of lecture material 
— should technically be looped into the 
category of “derivative works.”

The concept of students owning 
intellectual property over their notes has 
legal precedent. In the 1996 case University 
of Florida v. KPB, Inc., University of Florida 
lost a lawsuit against A-Plus Notes, a private 
note-selling service that hired students to 
take lecture notes for them. The U.S. Court of 
Appeals ultimately ruled that student-taken 

Striking A Wrong Note
UC Berkeley’s new note-sharing policy prohibits students from selling their notes to other students, a policy 
that infringes upon students’ rights and detracts from the flagship campus’s “open” learning atmosphere.

QUICK TAKES RESEARCHERS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO ARGUE THAT SUGAR SHOULD BE TAXED AND REGULATED TO KIDS UNDER 17 BECAUSE OF ITS HEALTH RISKS.

ILLUSTRATION BY JEFFREY LAU/GUARDIAN

There’s a lot I’ll miss about being a student after I graduate this quarter. 
Something I won’t miss: the myriad 
ways that we admit, on a biweekly 
basis in class, “I have no idea what the 
hell we’re studying, but here are my 

thoughts on the matter, and also on 
something unrelated that will allow 
me to weave in ‘hegemony.’”

Our wording in class discussion 
sometimes changes, just barely. 
“What I found interesting…” might 
be reworded as “I think, in many 
ways...” (or perhaps the more nuanced 
“in some ways…”). When really 
pressed, we can point to a passage 
in the reading that was, at some 
point, by some more diligent student, 
highlighted in a used textbook. 

To the chagrin of basically 
everyone but the least jaded of our 
professors, we can even sometimes 
make irrelevant challenges to the 
material. “Even though this is a 
history class, wouldn’t you say that 
we’re still this way today? Isn’t the 
‘American Imaginary’ alive and well? 
Isn’t there an argument here for that?”

Such are the challenging questions 
we deign to ask for the sake of 
participation points. And in a class of 
200 where no one’s accountable for 
anything but a paper and a midterm, 
maybe it’s enough to say that 
something “made you think.” There’s 
no space or time for anything more 
academically laborious, so please, just 
keeping crying “interesting.”

We can grumble about the greasy 
know-it-all in the front row whose 
eager hand and rolling backpack say: 
“Please. Choose me. Snicker at me.” 
That guy is often the most insufferable 
in the room, yes. But he’s also the 
reason the rest of us can zone out in 
the sixth row back, awaiting the lone 
day in ten weeks that we’re forced to 
actually say something.

Some of my professors have had 
a simple enough response to all of 
the bullshit posturing in class: quiz 
everyone. All of the time. That tends 
to work, but only after about half of us 
have dropped out. 

Others are so apparently defeated 
that instead, they screen a ton of 
movies — with the hope that, given 
unavoidable exposure to the material, 
we’ll have something more to say 
than “intriguing.” To an extent, that 
strategy works: it tends to inform 
discussions with as much expertise 
as we can gain from glimpsing the 
projection between text messages and 
catnaps. (Which is to say, it gives us a 
few more phrases in our artillery — 
ones like “I noticed that…” and “Just 
fascinating.”)

I don’t know that small classes 
are always the answer, either. When a 
friend of mine considered auditing a 
10-person seminar, the professor told 
him that he was certainly welcome, 
but that none of the students ever read 
enough to say anything. 

She was so embarrassed to lecture, 
she confessed, that she’d usually just 
put on CNN for an hour and cross her 
fingers for the best. (And that, I have 
to say, sounds like a very interesting 
idea to me.)

notes are not the intellectual property of professors. This 
ruling still stands today, meaning that UC Berkeley’s policy 
violates students’ rights and legal precedent.

Ironically, UC Berkeley hosted the 2008 Students for 
Free Culture convention, a grassroots conference focused 
on public access to knowledge, freedom of expression and 
civil liberties. Participants drafted the Wheeler Declaration, 
which touted having course materials as “open educational 
resources” and ensuring the “university network reflect the 
open nature of the internet” as two of five points that give 
Berkeley its “open” learning atmosphere. This new policy 
on note-sharing inherently runs countercurrent to this 
ideal. Unnecessary copyright protections stifle students’ 
ability to engage in the free exchange and expression 

of ideas, therefore making this a policy against sharing 
knowledge.

In the end, the policy will likely not have significant 
impact on students. Students will continue to do whatever 
they want with their notes, and use whichever resources 
they can get a hold of to prepare for exams.  However, 
university officials should recognize that the new policy 
encroaches upon students’ rights, and even goes against the 
UC Copyright Policy’s own statement that “the University 
encourages free expression and exchange of ideas.” 
Prohibiting the sale of professor’s published notes is one 
matter, but doing so for students’ own handwritten notes is 
quite another.

Note-Sharing Policy Hinders Free Exchange of  Ideas

QUITE FRANKLY By Lior Schenk

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Dear Editor,

On Thursday, Feb. 9, the 
Muir College Council failed to 
pass a resolution against the D-1 
referendum. Alyssa Wing and Mac 
Zilber made an appearance to 
critique the text of their resolution.

Wing repeated a statement 
that appeared in the Guardian 
on Jan. 30, 2012. She said that 
the concerns in a letter from the 
Student Fees Advisory Committee 
had referred to an outdated draft 
of the referendum, and that “all of 
the issues were addressed in the 
final draft,” as she was quoted in 
the Guardian.

However, the copy of the 
SFAC letter that I have quotes the 
referendum as follows: “According 
to Statement 6 in the Statement 
of Conditions, ‘The ASUCSD 
Council must annually review 
and approve the ICA budget.’ In 
the same statement, ‘[ASUCSD] 
shall comply with UC and 
UCSD policies, NCAA policies 
and regulations and contractual 
obligations of ICA.’”

The text of the referendum 
currently available to students on 
the as.ucsd.edu website reads as 
follows: “The ASUCSD Council 
must annually review and approve 
the ICA budget and shall comply 
with UC and UCSD policies, 
NCAA policies and regulations 
and the contractual commitments 
of ICA.”

The only change was from 
contractual ‘obligations’ to 
contractual ‘commitments.’ I 
assume that contracts are legally 
binding regardless of the words 
used to describe them.

It is possible that the letter I 

have is inauthentic, and I strongly 
recommend that the SFAC publish 
the original letter as an ‘open letter’ 
as a public service.

That assumption and caveat 
aside, it is clear that the same text 
which the SFAC said is “misleading 
and suggests falsehoods that 
appear to encourage voter 
approval” is still published on the 
as.ucsd.edu website.

But if the letter is accurate, 
and if the concerns contained 
in the letter are legitimate, then 
either one of two things is the 
case. Either AS Council has failed 
to make the final draft of the 
referendum available to the public, 
or the concerns of the Student 
Fees Advisory Committee have not 
been addressed.

I urge the Guardian to fact-
check statements made by public 
figures rather than take them at 
face value. 

I invite students, faculty 
and staff, to help reclaim 
public education on Mondays 
at 7 p.m. at CLICS or email 
MarchforMarch2012@gmail.com 
to get involved in mobilizing for 
the March 1 international day of 
action and walkout, and March 
5 reclamation of the capital in 
Sacramento.

GIFT 
GUIDE

massage at RimaC
BY ANGELA CHEN • EDITOR IN CHIEF

F or the paramour still recovering from midterms (and already stressing over finals), there’s nothing more thoughtful than the gift of relaxation in the form of a massage at RIMAC.
Unfortunately, luxury isn’t cheap: The options range from $45 to $65 for one hour, and start 

at $55 for 90 minutes — and that’s with the discount that comes with a student ID.  But the 
masseuses are certified, the on-campus location is convenient and there’s no chance that the 
parlor will turn out to be a grimy, dimly lit room sandwiched in a sketchy strip mall in North 
Park.

Options include everything from the general Swedish massage to the “deeper pressure, full 
body” athletic massage and the fancy heated stone version. And if you’re really stressed (or 
rich), you can buy seven and get the eighth free. 

mix Cd
BY ARIELLE SALLAI • MANAGING EDITOR

t he mixed CD: The only gift that can be both unoriginal and creative, easy and thoughtful. Sure, the object of your affection may have 
received dozens in her romantic lifetime, but she 
hasn’t received one from you. It’s like writing a letter 
via popular music — only you didn’t have to write 
anything yourself. 

Plus, if you aren’t paying for the music — and 
let’s be real, you aren’t paying for music — it only 
costs the price of one blank disk, which makes it the 
perfect gift for a new love without any high V-Day 
expectations. And you’ll know for sure your pursuit 
will be thinking of you when they listen to it for the 
first time. 

Bonus points for making a bedside mix, so you 
can give your lover more than just a soundtrack. This 
is your golden opportunity to break out all the Prince 
and R.Kelly in your iTunes library. Live it up.

The Great 
Burrito Hunt 
Begins at 
Don Carlos
S o, let’s get a few things straight: I am not a food critic. I have no culinary training and can’t afford 
to even utter the words “fine dining.” 
Truth is, I’m just a broke college stu-
dent who knows what she likes to eat. 

And to the girl whose heart is located 
directly in the pit of her stomach, a 
burrito is the epitome of a perfectly 
balanced comfort meal.

Now, one may think that I “hit the 
jackpot” by going to school in San 
Diego, where the burrito-radius is 
tight enough for a quick fix any time 
my addiction calls. But I take my bur-
rito consumption very, very seriously. 
I am not just looking for a burrito, 
I am looking for the best burrito. 
Anyone can slap together the basic 
ingredients and call it a wrap, but who 
among these has truly perfected the 
art? Surely not Goody’s, which consis-
tently disappoints me in my hour of 
hungry need (a bursting, ill-propor-
tioned mess is all I get). No, my search 
will have to venture past the outskirts 
of campus. As daunting as this task 
may seem, I am willing to take it on, 
for the sake of burrito-connoisseurs 
everywhere.

The first stop on my mission is 
surprisingly close: Don Carlos Taco 
Shop. Located in the notoriously bou-
gie setting of downtown La Jolla, this 
simplistic dive sticks out like a sore 
thumb. 

So I walk into the shop, bypassing 
the overwhelming menu options that 
don the wall, and dramatically ask 
the owner to give me his best burrito. 
Without a moment’s hesitation, he 
gives me the “El Nino,” confidently 
stating that he’d be “willing to go toe-
to-toe with any burrito in San Diego 
with this one.” Oh no, has my cover 
been blown before even starting?

It must have, because Don Carlos 
was pitching right to me, with some of 
my personal favorite ingredients mak-
ing star appearances in this burrito. 
Inspired by the Philly Cheesesteak, the 
El Nino (which costs $6.58) consists of 
carne asada, sautéed bell peppers and 
onions, with jalapeno jack cheese and 
pico de gallo salsa. 

The meat was freshly grilled and 
incredibly tender, and I was glad to 
see that it was cut into pretty small 
pieces, avoiding overwhelming bites 
of thick, chunky meat. The vegetables 
were neither too crunchy nor a soft, 
flavorless mush, so that even if I got 
a meatless bite I was not left disap-
pointed. 

Jalapeno pepper jack cheese is my 
all-time favorite cheese, and so I con-
sider the choice of pepper jack to be 
a clever and unique addition to the El 
Nino. It was melted just right, gooey

THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  MONDAY, FEBRUARY 13,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG 7

W ith a giant hog ornament on its roof representing co-owners Hanis Cavin and Sara Stroud’s pet mini-pig, Carnitas 
Speck, North Park’s Carnitas’ Snack Shack is all 
things pork from the get-go. 

Although the parking is terrible in this ‘hood, 
you can find customers already waiting in line as 
soon as the eatery’s walk-up window opens at noon. 
Behind the pint-sized kitchen is a casual cedar-pan-
eled patio, where an approximate 10-minute wait is 
necessary to get any seats. However, there’s no need 
to get upset since you’re likely to get those seats 
before the delicious slow-cooked food is served.

The condensed 
pork-plentiful menu 
changes frequently 
enough to entertain 
customers’ palates. 
Plus, the generous 
slab of pork in each 
dish — which certainly 
opposes the “snack” 
of the shack’s name 
— attracts customers 
even more. Sourcing 
as much as possible 
from local farms, this 
little outdoor eatery 

succeeds in combining fresh veggie garnishments 
(the side corn law that accompanies every dish) with 
hormone-free pork products from family farms in 
Iowa.

The Pork Sandwich ($9) is more of a burger, 
considering it’s stuffed with a “triple threat” of pork 
(fried-and-battered pork loin, Applewood smoked 
bacon, and tender pulled pork), pickled relish 
and Shack aioli. While the juicy pork serves as an 
excellent repository for the shack’s special aioli, a 
mayo-corn-tomato-pepper-cilantro mixture, the 
combination of the separate pork parts and other 
flavorful ingredients make the sandwich a bit too 
overpowering. As impossible as it sounds, there is 
just too much taste — and the poppy seed bun help-
lessly fails to embrace all these ingredients.

The Shack Steak Sandwich ($9) is more of a 
standout, even if it isn’t part of the shack’s famous 
swine family. Nonetheless, its grilled, tender, bone-
less rib-eye champions all. Served with pickled 

Serrano chilies, jalapeno jack cheese, tomatoes and 
chipotle aioli and planted on jalapeno-cheddar toast, 
it leaves a pleasant spiciness inside your mouth.  

For simpler folks, the Shack Burger ($9) — filled 
with butter lettuce, bacon jam, white cheddar and 
Shack aioli — tastes a lot plainer than the list of 
ingredients implies. Although the meat is very 
fulfilling and every bite is enjoyable, it has a rather 
ordinary taste for the price.

The Side Fries ($2.50) are thin, fresh-cut and 
seasoned with locally produced “Baker Shake” 
seasoning salt. They come stuffed in a small paper 
bag that matches the carefree atmosphere of the 
shack. Although the seasoning salt tastes a lot like 
top ramen powder, the fries are quite addicting. The 
fresh house-made ketchup that comes along is a 
good pairing too.

But it’s still all about the pork. So when craving a 
gourmet sandwich that is full (and we mean full) of 
flavors, Carnitas’ Snack Shack is surely a place to hit 
up for a casual lunch with friends over the weekend.

Don Carlos’ 
“El Nino” 
Proves Worthy 
of  the Hunt

a Casual BuRRito
BY MINA NILCHIAN • FOCUS EDITOR

F or the almost-maybe-not-quite couple, Valentine’s Day can be nothing but a big, fat, elephant in the room that even begins to rear its head weeks 
before the date itself. You want to avoid showing feelings 
that you aren’t certain are reciprocated, but also don’t 
want to look like a jerkwad. We advise that you keep it 
lighthearted. A gift card to your favorite hole-in-the-
wall burrito place that they haven’t heard of is friendly 
enough, but also entails a guaranteed outing with your 
potential boo in the future; it’s a win-win. 

enough to coat the entire burrito 
and offset the rest of the textures, 
while adding a mild spice to give it 
a little kick. The pico de gallo was 
a great addition as well, though I 
noticed that it wasn’t consistent 
throughout, and I felt cheated dur-
ing the second half of salsa-less 
burrito. 

Though often forgotten, the 
tortilla itself made a significant 
contribution. Too often have I run 
into a burrito with a tough, almost 
crunchy exterior, but this one was 
pillowy and chewy, adding distinct 
sweetness to the party. One draw-
back was the amount of grease in 
the burrito, which I guess was to 
be somewhat expected from the 
generous portion of melted cheese. 
I actually took a bite from the bot-
tom and watched the orange drip-
pings waterfall into an unappetizing 
little pool in my foil. I didn’t finish 
the rest of the burrito after watch-
ing that. However, it was undoubt-
edly a delicious piece of work, and 
I can understand why Don Carlos 
is considered such a “community 
asset.”

So, as this column explores the 
ins and outs of San Diego burritos, 
I will give my honest and humble 
opinion in hopes of finding my one 
true love once and for all. It may be 
a daunting challenge, but if the El 
Nino from Don Carlos Taco Shop 
is any indication of my tasty travels 
to come, I think my heart/stomach 
will be more than willing to take 
it on.

d on’t let your single friend stay at home celebrating Single Awareness Day tomorrow night. Valentine’s Day is the day for romance and he or she could very well be comforting the hearts 
of lonely co-eds with the bathroom read “Pickups and Come-Ons for All 
Occasions (Lines for All Occasions).” So order a hottie a drink, use a few lines 
(“WWJD? Tell you to go out with me” is a gem) and make the night magical. 

Anything can happen when love (i.e. loneliness) is in the air — or, at the 
very least, your friend can break out the lines with confidence once the dark 
cloud over Feb.14 passes.

a puzzle
BY ARIELLE SALLAI • 
MANAGING EDITOR

imagine staring into your lover’s eyes over a starry night. You’ve 
got smooth jazz playing, a 
bottle of wine and a plate 
of cheese. It’s the picture of 
romance. Also, boring.

Try this instead: The 
starry night is actually a 
1,000-piece puzzle of Van Gogh’s “Starry Night,” 
you’re bumping ’80s pop and you’re drinking a beer 
(the cheese can stay). 

In essence, it’s a date and a nostalgic laugh in 
a box. The UCSD bookstore currently has a full 
display of various puzzles for whatever your par-
amour’s interested in, including Albert Einstein, the 
periodic table, giraffes and more fine art.

If you’re extra dedicated, fill out the puzzle with-
out your boo yourself and write a cheesy note on 
the back (“You were my missing puzzle piece”) for 
a special puzzle completion discovery, though the 
whole “flip the puzzle over” thing at the end could 
get complicated.

tag yo’ love
BY MARGARET YAU • MANAGING EDITOR

i n Paris, lovers clasp little metal locks on the so-called “lover’s bridge” to signify their eternal devotion and toss the key into the river Seine. If you can’t afford a trip to France any time soon, show your devotion to your 
better half by tagging up UCSD’s graffiti wall with a display of your gushi-
est feelings. It’s more permanent than the cliche bouquet of flowers that will 
wilt long before the relationship does, but it’s not as drastic as tattooing your 
lover’s face onto your upper arm. Instead, make your emotions a semi-per-
manent part of UCSD’s landscape — that is, until someone draws over it.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  MONDAY, FEBRUARY 13,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG 11

BY RACHEL UDA
Sports Editor

Last week, the UCSD Men’s Volleyball team hosted two games against No. 3 nationally ranked Brigham Young 
University. 

The Tritons dropped two straight matches 
against the Cougars.

The Cougars swept the Tritons in their 
first match on Thursday, Feb. 9. 

It was a close game, as BYU narrowly 
edged the Tritons 27-25 despite the presence 
of a large home fan base. 

But UCSD out hit its opposition, finishing 
with 13 kills to the Cougars’ seven kills in the 
first set. 

The difference was on the defensive end, 
with the Cougars out-blocking the Tritons 
22-13.

“BYU’s one of the best blocking teams in 
the nation and they showed up tonight and 
were incredible at closing blocks,” sophomore 
Sebastian Brady said. “We need to be able to 
adjust to their big block.”

The momentum could have swung to the 
Tritons’ side if UCSD had pulled out the first 
game, as the second and third sets were never 
really close, with BYU closing out the match 
25-21 and 25-20.

In preparation for their second match 
against BYU, Brady stressed the importance 
of serving.

“We can’t beat a great team like that if 
we’re missing serves,” Brady said. “We played 

great stretches, but if you’re going to string a 
stretch together for the whole game we can 
take that game easily.”

The Tritons went into their rematch 
against BYU on Saturday, Feb. 12, taking 
the game to five sets before falling to the 
Cougars.

UCSD sophomore outside hitter Vaun 
Lennon led all players with a career high 
of 25 kills, but it wasn’t enough to put the 
Tritons over the top.

The five set bout lasted two and a half 
hours. 

Brigham Young took the first set 21-25, 
although the Tritons won the second set in 
a hard-fought battle that the Tritons just 
narrowly won 42-40. 

BYU took the third set to go up 2-1, but 

UCSD tied it up at 2-2 by winning the fourth 
set. 

The win marked the only time in program 
history that the Tritons have been able to 
take two sets in one match against Brigham 
Young’s men’s volleyball program. 

From there, the Tritons seemed gassed as 
BYU easily took the overtime set 15-10, off of 
five errors.

With the pair of losses, the Tritons drop 
to 4-9 overall. 

UCSD continues its homestead this 
weekend where the Tritons will take on the 
University of Pacific on Friday, Feb. 17 and 
Stanford the following day.

opportunities at the basket for the other teams. 
But on Friday, the Tritons were out-shot 59-46 
and out-rebounded 36-25.

On Saturday, the story was similar, with 
the rebound count leaning 37-27 in favor of 
the Warriors. Despite being out-rebounded, 
the Tritons shot 59 times to Stanislaus’ 51, 
but UCSD only made 14, for a season low 23 
percent from the field. The Warriors fared 
little better, with senior forward Reggie Jones 
going 4-of-16 from the field to lead the game 
with 12 points.

The Tritons played good defense to hold 
Jones to 12, as the 6’9” forward averages nearly 
18 points per game on the season. 

After scoring the first four points of the 
half, the Triton offense struggled to maintain 
its pace and fell victim to a 16-3 Warrior 
offensive strike over the next nine minutes. 
McCann and senior forward Mike Meza 
scored nine points a piece to lead the Triton 
offense, which scored only 20 points in the 
first half and 22 points in the second.

The Warriors led the rest of the game, 
leaving the Tritons behind to bring their 

offense up to shooting 48 percent on the 
second half of the night to finish off the 
Tritons 55-42.

In their last home game of the season, the 
Tritons honored their three graduating seniors 
— Hatch, Meza and senior forward Ryan 
Wheeler.

“It’s going to be really tough losing the 
seniors,” McCann said. “[Hatch] has been a 
really big part of the team for the past four 
years. We’re gonna lose a big piece in the 
center position, and [Wheeler] does great 
things for us defensively.”

Coming into the game, the Warriors had 
dropped three straight and were losing their 
grasp on eighth place in the CCAA. With the 
win over No. 9 ranked UCSD, the Warriors 
have all but secured their position in the 
CCAA tournament. 

The Tritons now head out on the road for 
their final four games of the season, starting 
with Cal State Monterey Bay next Friday, Feb. 
17.

down to less than nine points in the second 
half, as their offense off the counterattack fell 
apart. Chico committed 22 turnovers, which 
UCSD had no trouble converting into 28 
points.

“We mixed some things up defensively,” 
Elliot said. “We were having a little trouble 
stopping their dribble penetration. And we 
both want to play fast, so I think any time we 
play Chico it’s going to be a [high] scoring 
night for both teams.”

On Saturday, UCSD honored its three 
rostered seniors — Carlisle, Feder and 
Freidenberg — in the last home game of 
the season. The trio all enjoyed double digit 
points on senior night. Freidenberg recorded 
17 points in her 17 minutes on the court, 
while Feder chipped in 17 points and Carlisle 
finished with 12 points on top of four assists. 
    Against the 5-16 Warriors, UCSD raced out 
to take a 22-point lead with seven minutes 
left in the first half, after which Elliot put her 
reserves on the court.  
    The Tritons finished the first half with a 
17-point lead. Cal State Stanislaus never came 

close for the remainder of the game, as every 
person on the Tritons’ 14-man roster saw 
time on the court. UCSD’s 5’10” sophomore 
utility Elaina White hit two three-pointers for 
eight points, while 5’4” guard Stephanie Yano 
recorded four points on top of four assists. 
    “It was very emotional, because we’re near 
the end of the conference,” Freidenberg said. 
“Although that’s the end of one chapter, we’re 
beginning another with the CCAA playoffs.” 
    Undefeated in league, the No. 1 Tritons 
were the first CCAA team to qualify for the 
conference playoffs. UCSD will host the CCAA 
playoffs, to be played on Tuesday, Feb. 28. 
They will be joined by second place Cal State 
Monterey Bay, third place Humboldt State and 
fourth place Cal State Los Angeles. The eight 
remaining conference teams will compete for 
the last four spots. 
    The Tritons have one more road trip. On 
Friday, the Tritons will take on second in 
conference Cal State Monterey Bay, and on 
Saturday, UCSD faces Cal State East Bay.

The Tritons Men’s and Women’s Swimming and Diving team took the league championships by storm this weekend, each winning its fourth 
consecutive first-place titles at the 2012 Pacific Coast 
Swimming and Diving Championships, held at the 
Splash! La Mirada Aquatic Center. The men’s team, No. 
3 in the country, topped the field with four victories 
and a score of 1649, besting second place finisher Cal 
Baptist (1422) and third place Concordia (1133). 
    The men had an especially strong showing in the 
breaststroke events. The team swept all four top spots 
in both the 100 and 200 yard with sophomore Nick 
Korth coming in first in the 100 yard with a time of 
54.62, sophomore See Lee in second (55.51), junior 
Jacob Lamont in third (55.88) and senior Griffin 
Bracke in fourth (56.52). The Tritons swept in the same 
order in the 200 yard, with Korth in first (1:57.47), 
Lee in second (2:00.96), Lamont in third (2:01.27) and 
Bracke in fourth (2:03.66).  The Triton men’s team also 
posted solid wins — the 400 free relay fell to the UCSD 
team of sophomore Reid McCallum, sophomore Alex 
Merrill, Bracke and senior Blake Langland with a race 
winning time of 3:01.17. Individual wins included 
junior Adam Rice in the 200 butterfly with a time 

of 1:49.53 and sophomore Martin Vanek in the 200 
backstroke with a time of 1:49.87. 
     The women’s team, ranked No. 1 nationally, won 
three events on Saturday to take the first-place win in 
the championship with a final score of 1663.5, beating 
Cal Baptist (1268.5), and the trailing third place 
finisher Fresno Pacific (733).  
     Like the men’s team, the Triton women did well 
in the 200-yard breaststroke, sweeping the event with 
Emily Adamcyzk for the win (2:16.71), Neda Nguyen 
in second (2:19.22), Eva Chen in third (2:20.57) and 
Casey Adams in fourth (2:21.63).  The women’s 400-
yard freestyle relay team consisting of Sierra Robbins, 
Amber Tan, Jaclyn Among and Chen won with a 
time of 3:29.13. The UCSD women also did well in 
individual events, placing winning times in the 200-
yard backstroke (Alex Henley, 1:58.19) and the 100-
yard freestyle (Olivia Fountain, 51.86).  
    The men’s and women’s teams had wins in 26 
separate events — 14 on the men’s side and 12 on the 
women’s. From those wins, 10 came from the relays 
and 16 came from individual events.  
     The Tritons’ next meet is the NCAA 
Championships, set to take place in Mansfield, Texas 
from March 14-17.

Tritons Drop Last Pair of Home 
Games Against Chico, Stanislaus

No. 1 UCSD Women’s Basketball 
Protects 24-0 Perfect Season

BY NICK HOWE
Associate Sports Editor

The Triton Men’s Basketball team suffered two losses this past weekend as they fell to the CCAA-leading Cal State 
Chico Wildcats on Friday and middle-of-the-
pack Cal State Stanislaus on Saturday. The pair 
of losses kills any chance of UCSD making the 
CCAA playoff tournament.  
    On Friday, Feb. 10 against Chico State, the 
game was much closer than the 71-64 final 
score would suggest. Senior center Christian 
Hatch had his best game of the regular season, 
scoring 22 points on six rebounds. Playing 
with a wrist sprained mid-season against CSU 
Monterey Bay, the big-man finally snapped 
his scoring drought to regain the steam he lost 
after his injury. 
    Sophomore point guard James McCann 
added 17 points to the Triton tally and nabbed 
three rebounds. 
    Thanks largely to these two players, the 
Tritons found themselves 10 points up with 
8:17 remaining. The Wildcats then went on a 
10-5 run over the next four minutes to tie the 
game at 55 points. Junior guard Tyler McGrath 

hit a jumper, one of three on the night for 10 
points, to put the Tritons back in the lead. 
Chico quickly responded with seven points to 
make the score 62-57 with 2:16 remaining.  
    The Tritons responded with a McGrath 
three and two McCann free throws to tie the 
game again at 62, but with the clock winding 
down, the Tritons were forced to foul.

When Chico inbounded the ball, UCSD 
fouled Chico guard Demario Simms, who sank 
both free throws. McCann drew a foul on the 
following play, but his free throws were not 
enough to close the gap.

On the final full play of the game, McCann 
lost the ball going up for a match-tying three-
pointer, and Chico drew the foul for two free 
throws to close the game 71-64.

The Tritons played a very well-rounded 
game against Chico, shooting 50 percent from 
the field and limiting the Wildcats to just 46 
percent. UCSD also managed to shoot four of 
nine from three-point land. 

The deciding difference between the two 
closely matched squads was rebounds and 
shots taken. In their wins last week, the Tritons 
out-rebounded the opposition and thus got 
more shots for themselves and allowed less

The No. 1 UCSD Women’s Basketball team closed out its regular season home schedule with two more wins to extend 
its perfect record to 24-0. 

On Friday, the Tritons took their 23rd 
consecutive win in a high scoring 76-93 bout 
against 12-9 Chico State. 

Against the Wildcats, who took the game 
into overtime in their first matchup of the 
season, UCSD pushed tempo from the tip-
off, taking a six-point lead within the first 
three minutes. Chico posed a threat in guards 
Natasha Smith and shooting guard Courtney 
Hamilton, who went 4-of-4 from the field, the 
two combined for 37 points. In conjunction 
with guard Synchro Bull, whose aggressive 
penetration into the key got seniors Daisy Feder 
and Lauren Freidenberg in foul trouble early in 
the half.

“I think we got a little bit out of sorts with 
[Feder] and [Freidenberg] picking up two quick 
fouls, but I was so proud of our bench and the 
way they came in the first half and got us an 
11-point lead at half time,” UCSD head coach 

Charity Elliot said. 
Freshman center Dana Webster and 

sophomore guard Megan Perry came into 
replace the seniors. Perry — who has assumed 
the role of utility — posting up or playing from 
the perimeter as needed, had a good night, 
going 2-for-3 for eight points.

All of UCSD’s starters recorded double 
digits, with senior guard Chelsea Carlisle 
leading the Tritons in four categories. Carlisle 
recorded 26 points, seven rebounds, four assists 
and five steals. Feder finished with 19 points, 
while sophomore forward Erin Dautremont 
recorded 18 points off 7-for-10 shooting. 
Freidenberg chipped in 10 points and junior 
guard Emily Osga put away 12 points.

“That’s what I think makes this team so 
special,” Elliot said. “If you try and shut down 
[Carlisle] then you got [Osga] and [Feder] going 
off. If you try and shut down [Freidenberg] then 
you have Dautremont going off, it’s just really 
nice, and then we add in Megan Perry to that 
mix. We throw her into every possible position 
that you can play, and she just does her job, gets 
some charges, gets some rebounds and is even 
aggressively attacking the basket at times.”

The Wildcats were unable to cut the lead
