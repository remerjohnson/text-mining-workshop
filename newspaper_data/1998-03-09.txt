Man Was looking 
Under 5DSU Stalls 
SAN DIEGO - Police at 
San Diego State University 
interviewed a man allegedly 
looking under the stall s in a 
men 's bathroom on Feb. 27 . 
Police would not confirm 
reports that the 38-year-old 
man. who is not a student , 
had been seen on campus 
be fore. According to a police 
report. he does match the 
descri pti on of suspects in 
other inc idents. Because no 
crime was committed in the 
presence or police or ident ifi -
able wit nesses, the man was 
ordered o'l campus for 30 
days .

Gambling to be 
Offered as Course 
EAST LANSING, Mich. -
According to some Michigan 
State University faculty 
members, the Academic 
Council took a gamble on 
Tuesday after approving 
courses that teach students 
how to manage a cas ino. The 
courses will be offered as an 
elective in the School of 
Hospitality Business and will 
deal with the social issues, 
practi ces, problems and 
finance of gaming. Professor 
Shawnee Vickery, who asked 
ror a dismissal of the propos-
al, asked during the meeting 
if the university wanted to be 
"assoc iated with an ac ti vity 
that will teach impress ion-
able young people how to 
gamble." Associate Professor 
John Tarras said students 
have the right to choose 
whether they want to gamble 
and the courses will provide 
the knowledge needed to 
make that decision.

al only aI graduating seniors, Lytle said. 

When President Bill Clinton agreed to speak 
to UCSD's class of 1997, the university scram-
hied to add the first-ever all-campus com-
mencement to its usual repertoire of graduation 
ceremonies held by each or the live colleges. 

"The invitati on for linton was very rare 
and very special," Marshall College Pro vost 
Cecil Lytle said . " It didn 't set a precedent. It 
was a one-time event." 

According to A.S. Vice President Finance 
Tony Fiori , graduating seniors deserve a big 
event in their honor. He also be li eves that such 
an event would bring unity to the decentral -
ized campus. 

" If you can talk about trickle-down morale, 
then you can talk about the effect of graduat.-
ing seniors on sophomores," Warren College 
Provost David Jordan said . 

or course, there is also the question of 
funding. According to Fiori , the university 
annually spends a combined total of about 
$50,000 for individual college commence-
ments. However, it is unclear how much an 
all-campus commencement would cost; esti -
mates range from $ 100,000 to $500,000. 

The success of that event may have set a 
precedent, as the campus community awaits a 
dec ision from the chance llor's offi ce on the 
future of all-campus commencements. The 
announcement ror that decision is expected to 
arrive some time thi s week. 

An all-campus commencement would not 
replace the co llege graduation ceremonies, 
and its benerits would be re-evaluated after 
two lo three years. However. di sagreement 

"UCSD came together for one day, and we 
celebrated U SD las a wholel, and not the 
individual co lleges," Fiori said . 

But if the poi nt of an all-campus commence-
ment is to unite the campus, then there oughl to 
be more events ai med at the enti re campus, not 

According to Fiori , the benefit s of an all-
campus commencement outweigh the finan-

Scientists Use Chaos To Advance Telecommunications 
WIRELESS: New 
method will improve 
security and clarity 
By S. Javan Wygal 
Staff Writer 

A multi-university team hopes to 
harness the principle of chaos as the 
backbone of a new communication 
system: a wireless network lhat is 
simpler and more secure than current 
method of telecommunications. 

Researchers rrom UCSD 's 
Institute for Nonlinear Science and 
the engineering school. UCLA and 
Stanford University have received 
up to $4.5 million ($2.7 million for 
three years, with an option for $1 .8 
for the following two years) from 

the U.S. Departmenl of Defense's 
Army Research Office to build the 
system. Also prov iding support arc 
industry partners Quak omm , 
Hughes Elec tronics, Scientific 
Atlanta, Ari el Systems. Jaear, ' 
Lockheed Martin and Recording 
Physics. 

Lawrence Lawson, pro fessor at 
UCSD's Center for Wireless 
Communications and the principal 
inve tigator for the projcct, hopes 
this project will result in a revolu-
tion of communications security. 

"It 's our hope that thi s system 
will have important long-term ben-
efitto the wirele s-comll1unications 
industry here in San Diego and 
worldwide," he said. "There's this 
possibilily of a whole new way of 

communicating in a secure and 
very power-effi cient way that will 
come out of thi s re earch." 

The design concept , called Stable 
Nonlinear Transmitter/Receiver 
(SANT) was itselr suggested by a 
team from UCSD, the Georgia 
Institute of Technology and Cornell 
Uni versity working under a 
National Science Foundation grant. 
Henry Abarbanel, director of the 
Institute on Nonlinear Science, and 
post-doctoral researcher Mallhew 
Kennel will publish their findings in 
an upcoming __ issue of Physical 
Review Letters. 

Traditional communication sys-
tems are designed to transmit linear 
signal which arrive in a linear 
mode at a receiver. When pushed to 

maximum power, however, lhese 
signals become distorted as "non-
linear" noise. A tremendous amount 
of power must be allocated to 
dampen the effect of thi s di stortion. 

The SANT concept weaves com-
munications into a chaotic signal, 
which sounds like static, and then 
transmits through a medium (optical 
fiber in the case of Abarbanel's 
learn) the combined signal or chaos 
and message. A receiver, synchro-
nized lO only the chaotic part, ub-
tracls the chaos, and is left with the 
lransmilled message. Due to the syn-
chronization, the infonnation is sent 
and received with no distortion.

UCSD Will Link to vBNS Network 
President Clinton announced that UCSD will link to 

the very high performance Backbone Network Service 
(vBNS). This connection allows scientists and engineers 
across the country to co llaborate and share powerful 
computing and information resources. 

Though the Internet is already high·speed, the can· 
gestion from messages among the estimated 60 million 
users of the Internet and the World Wide Web make it 
inadequate to support leading-edge research. To reme-
dy this, the vBNS was started by the National Science 
Foundation and implemented by MCI 
Telecommunications Corporation as a means of ensur-
ing throughput between the nation' s research and engi-
neering organizations. 

vBNS currently runs at 622 million bits per second 
and is expected to operate at 2.4 billion bits per second 
by the year 2000 . By comparison, a typical modem 
operates at 28,800 bits per second. 

UCSD Associate Professor 
Awarded NAS Award for Research 

Arthur Lupia , an associate professor of political sci-
ence . is the ftrst political scientist to receive the presti· 
gious National Academy of Sciences Award for 
Initiatives in Research . 

The award ot $15,000 is given annually to recognize 
innovative young scientists and to encourage research 
likely to lead toward new capabilities tor human benefit. 

Lupia is studying how political decision-making at the 
elec.toral . legislative and judicial levels is affected by dif-

ferent cognitive factors and institutional incentives. He 
recently co-authored a book, The Democratic Dilemma: 
Can Citizens Learn What They Need to Know, which corn-
bines insights from the disciplines of political science, 
economics and cognitive science to explain how citizens 
gather and use information to make political decisions. 

Moreover, Lupia, along with UCSD POlitical SCience 
professors Mathew McCubbins and Elizabeth Gerber, 
recently won a research grant from the Public Policy 
Institute of California to conduct a study on voter initia-
tives and their cumulative impact on legislative deci-
sion-making and the state budgetary process. 

UCSD Professor Gives 
Presentation at UPenn 

Chandra Mukerji, UCSD professor of communica· 
tions and sociology, presented her work on the gardens 
of Versailles at a symposium entitled "Tradition and 
Innovation in French Garden Art: Chapters of a New 
Histor y" at the University of Pennsylvania. 

Tile symposium featured experts trom the United 
States and France as presenters, as well as an exhibition 
of books and other publications on the French garden. 

Mukerji recently authored a book about the mil itary 
and political significance of Louis XIV's gardens at 
Versailles. 

The symposium was sponsored by Penn 's 
Department of Landscape ArChitecture and Regional 
Planning, French Institute for Culture and Technology, 
and Morris Arboretum.

PINION 
Bunnies&\ 

Under the guise of striving to educate visitors 
and to preserve the cuddly creatures within, zoos 
are merely technologically obsolete, capitalistic 

ventures designed to warehouse animals 
By Jessyca Wallace 
Associate Opinion Editor 

Imagine, if you will, a brilliant light shi ning 
from lhe sky, rollowed by the unmistakable 
arrival of an alien space ship descending 
through the cumulus clouds and landing gent ly 
in orth Parking. Strange crealures with four 
stocky legs and long, narrow noses beari ng 
tranquilil.er guns emerge frolll the sil ver pod 
and begin to take ailll at students who arc 100 
husy trying to catch the shutt le to be conL:emed 
with Ileeing from their impending doom. 

They pick off scores of students, being 
sure to nab a couple of Asians, a few African 
Ameril:ans, some white student s, a rare 
Eski mo and perhaps a student of Middle 
Eastern descent for good measure. The stu-
dents arc then gathered and loaded into 
wooden transport boxes measuring approx i-
mately 6-by-3-by-2 feet. 

The studen ts gradually awaken on the long 
journey to these aliens' home planet across the 

galaxy, totall y unaware of where 
they arc or what horrible fa te 

awaits them. The 
space. shi p 

lands, and 

after the students arc unloaded, they arc iso-
laled by race, divided into male-female pair~ 
and put into I O-by- I O-foot roOIllS with one 
clear wall and no cei ling. The roo ms contain a 
bed. a sofa, a television and a stationary hi cy-
cle - the decor is institutional. 

Needless to say, the students becoille re t-
less ina short period of ti me. They have been 
taken from I heir homes and fami lies without 
warning, brought to a strange place, put in 
small rooms and put on di splay 24 hours a day. 

The ali ens justi fy th is treatment or the stu-
dents by say ing thai they arc teaching the ir 
fe ll ow beings about humans. They claim 
many of the student s were unhea lthy in the 
first place and thus cou ld be held in capti vi ty 
to heal. The studenls also make a ni ce touri st 
att rac ti on to generate revenue for their plane-
tary upkeep budget. 

Although the idea of thi s story mi ght seem 
a bit far-fetched and cruel , it is striking Iy sim-
il ar to the asi nine praL: tice huma n~ have of cap-
turing, caging, studyi ng and chargi ng admis-
sion to see animals in zoos. One docs not need 
to be an animal activist in order to appreL: iate 
the magnitude of crue lty involved in capturing 
animals wit h capitalistic intenlions. 

The San Diego Zoo at Balboa Park i~ a 
prime example of the hypoL:ritica l immora lity 
of zoos. It demonstrates extreme capitali stic 
greed by charging a whopping $ 16 admission 
for adult s. It prov idcs inappropriately sized 
housing for MJIlH': animals. It take ' animals 
that li ve in climates vastly different from San 
Diego and puts thcm in outdoor hahitat s.

certain rules laid out by the A .S. I 
lCellhat the rules arc rair to all par-
ties, in that they promnte proper 
journalisti!.: opportunitie~ for ,tu-

dent ~ at U SO. 
In my exp.:riences, alternative 
puhlicati on~ often adju;t their bud· 
gets by printing extra mpies or 
extra pages in order to meet proper 
budget a ll ocati on~ . 

I simpl y applaud the A .S. for 
seeking to end the wasteful spend-
ing by alternati ve publi ca tions on 
campus. Twenly -three thousand 
cupies of the Chicano-Mexicano 
newspaper definitely proved to be 
wasterul to the A.S. and the stu-
dents. This action identified that 
the newspaper was highly unrepre-
sentative to the students and was 
willing to waste their va luable 
money. 

One solution A.S . media com· 
miss ioner Valerie Grant should 
consider is to re-establish the pur-
pose of the alternative media on 
campus. Alternative papers are lit· 
tered across campus without read· 
ership or purpose. And most alter· 
native media will play games with 
their allocated hudgets in order to 
survive each year. 

As for the other two publica-
tions, I'm sad to sec two long-time 
UCSD puhlications almost dimi· 
nat l.!d due 10 apathy and irrespunsi -
hi lity. 

"very alternative puhlication 
had to ahide by these rules, and the 
A.S. should not grant spec ial 
rCl:Ogniti nn to these puhlications.

There wa~ a time in whidl a

Continued from page 4 
about the dimate in San Dicgo'!The 
average daily temperature IS 
approximately 70 degrees. How, 
then, docs a creature like a polar 
bear, whose fur and skin act as nat-
ural conveners of energy rrom the 
sun into body heat, survive outdoors 
in sunny Southern California? 

When asked about thi s curious 
detai I, a zookeeper responded, 
" Well , the polar bears here have 
much less fat on their bodies than 
tbe ones found at the polar caps so 
their body temperatures arc regu-
lated for San Diego weather." 

With limited biological knowl-
edge, it is sti II possible to deduce 
that, just because a bear adapts to 
a warmcr cI i matc does not mean 
that it is hea lthy for the bear to live 
in that warmer climate. 

Another argument that zoo ati -
cionados thrust at opponents is 
that most of these zoo animals 
were sick or wcrc born in captivi-
ty. I f you capture a sick animal

why not release it back to the envi-

I I' you rai sed a chi ld from the 
minute it was born until the day it 
died in a house, never allowing it 
to leave so it does not know any

do? Is it still healthy, either physi-
cally or mentally, for the chi Id? Of 
course not. Why is it therefore 
acceptable to raise an animal in 
captivity '! Perhaps it is because 
the animal cannot tell you that it

Some say that if these animals 
were going to die in the wi Id any-
way we should benefit from their 
capture and not be concerned with 
the consequences for the animals. 
However, in the true spirit of nature 
with a distinctly Darwinian spin, 
we should just leave the animals to

if humans recognized that we, too,

. The people responsible for 
U.S. diplomacy could certainly 
u e a lillie less zeal and a lot mon: 
" real politik." 

At this time, the United State, 
is assum ing more and more often 
the role of arbiter or international 
disputes, and a number of very 
delicate internati onal prohlem~ 
depend on rat ional American 
negotiation. 

In other words, a number of 
international problems wi ll require 
pragmatic and rationa l Ihinking 
from the ~alm; people who drafted 
and approved the Helms·BUlton 
bi II. at a reassuring thought. 

Worlu. These arrogant humans not 
only capture animals, but they 
train them to do tricks in order to 
allract tourists and their money. 
Of what possib le value is human 
entertainment to a ki lIer whale? 

Although zoos at one point in 
time may have heen a valuable 
source of bio logical knowledge 
for the masses, they have become 
obsolete. 

This is the age of technology. 
Humans have documented every 
aspect of every species or animals 
known with lilm, surveys, studies 
and photographs taken in the wild. 
This documentation is widely 
avai lable on that handy intemation-
al resource known as the intemet. 

Access to thi s information is 
available to almost everyone who 
wants it. It is easy to look up 
close-range photographs of ani · 
mals, information about their nat-
ural habitats. data on their hehav-
ior and sta ti sti cs about popula· 
ti ons on the internet. 

Although the Internet is not 
accessible to everyone for finan-
cia I reasons, these same people 
wou ld be unlikely to gain equiva-
lent knowledge from the zoo at the 
mighty price of $16 per person.

INSTITUTIONAL 
ACCREDITATION 

OPEN FORUM 
During 1998 UCSD wi ll complete the process, mandated by the W st rn Assoc i at~on of Scho Land 
Colleges (WASC), of reaffirming its institutional accred itati on with the Senior Accrediting Commission ' 
of Schools and Colleges, which is part of WASC 

The Accrediting Commis ion has recogniz d four major purposes of accreditation: 
• To assure the educational community, the general public, and oth r organizations and agencies that 

an institution has clearly defi ned objective. appropriate to higher education and that it meets 
Commission standards; 

To encourage institutional development and improvement through self study and periodic 
evaluation be qualified p er professionals; 

• To develop and use standards to asse .. and enhance educational qual ity and institutional 
performance, and to validate these :tandards by ongoing r search; and 

To promote interchang of ideas among public and independent institutions through p r revIew. 

On M arch 17-20, 1998 , the WASC Accreditation Team wi II conduct a site visit on our campu . . 
The purpose of the site visit is to allow the vi 'iting team to have open discussion. with members of our 
campus in response to our Self Study. All interested member. of the campus are invited to meet with the 
Accreditation Team during open forums on March 19, 1998 at the following designated time, : 

Time 
1 :00 p.m. 
2:00 p.m. 
3:00 p.m. 

Location

A website has been developed to provide members of the vi iting team, other WASC and university 
officials , UCSD students, faculty and staff and the general public with easy access to the pertinent 
information about UCSD and our Self StUdy. 

The web site is located at hup://planning.ucsd,edu/accred-main.htm 

The accreditation process is very important to out campus. Please join me in welcoming the 
Accreditation Team and a sisting them in thi s important effort.

The dangers of rape often exist with acquaintances 

!tlt ca 

arents and rrie nds warn us about the danger of strangers lurking in the 
dark . Tools or defense, such as pepper spray and wh istles, are so ld as 
gifts and key chains for the consc ientious woman, to protect herself from 

the most grievous of all personal attacks. But statisti cs show that for most 
women, the dJnger docs not lie wi th the evil lurking in th.: shadows, hut more 
wi th the people who arc familiar in our everyday li ves. 

Forced sexual intercourse has stead ily gained notori.:ty as a crim.: in 'th is 
soc iety as the status of women has improved. The i~slles ~urrou nding thi , 

crime arc always under examinati on. Although both m.:n and women can he vic-
tims. the predominate gender of vict ims is remale, and the predominate gcnder of 
p.:rpetrators is ma le. 

Recently new concerns have also hcen raised rega rding date rape. Th.: ra te o( 
m;cu rrence, the definition or what exadly constitutes rape. and accuracy of rape 
charges. especiall y date rape. are con trovers ial in today's society. AJditionally, 
toob such as Gamma-hydrox yhutrate (G HB). Rohyp nol ( roofie~). the les~ common 
ketaminc amf alcohol , have bcen introduced into the rca lms or cri minal prosecution.

Psycho Therapy 
Calling All Females: Winner of Mary's Superlative 
Award is UCSD's "Most Awesome Single Guy" 
By Mary Higgins Senior Staff Writer 

The results for the 199!S 
Superlati ve Award are in . Before I 
reveal the winner, I want to thank 
the two olher judges who helped 
me out: Guardian Editor-In -Chief 
Terry Lew and News Co-Editor 
Ryan Olson. 

The winner of the I Y9M 
Superlative Award goes to Reve lle 
sophomore Charles Ruggiero in the 
category of "Most Awesome Single 
Guy." 

Originall y, hi s so-called fri ends 
nominated him in the category of 
"Most In Need of A Woman," hut 
the editors here at the Gllardian 
dec ided that was way too harsh. 

So, anyway, congratulati ons 
Charles . For all o f you si ngle 
ICrnales out there, I highl y recom-
mend that yo u wo rk Ufl enough 
courage ((l approach th is sexy 
young man and ask him out. 
Having met Charles, I can tell you 
that he is intelligent , witty and 
momentaril y, !,Ip-for-g rahs 
although I can' t fl romise you that 
will last (the ufl-for-grahs part , I 
mean). 

Not that looks should ever mat-
ter, hut I ha ve to admit he ain ' t too 
hard on the eyes. 

Other qualitie, that might 
appea l to ingle women include: a 
charming sense of humor, acce~s to 
a car, and 'he ability to with ~land 

large quantiti es of nagg ing and 
comfll aining. 

Here is an excerpt from the 
award-winning nomination essay, 
suhmitted hy Reve lle students 
Rosanne Kara and Meaghan 
Goelt z: 

" lWei would like to nominate 
Charles Ruggiero Ihccause l we just 
don' t think he can fi nd anyone on 
his own ... he's a Revelle student for 
crying out loud

' 
He's a decent guy, 

but more than the shiny blue rih-
hon, we think he could really use 
the heer. So what if he is under 21" 
He acts old enough and that shou ld 
he good for something." 

Aflflareml y, these girls nominat -
ed Charles for the sole flurflose of 
getting him drunk . Of cour~e, a~ a 
UCSD em[lloyee, I can' t [lurcha~e 
alcohol for a minor. On the other 
hand, Charles earned the mo,t 
floi nt , for ac tu ally having two 
wo men cla im he was more mature 
than his ac tual age. To the ra nel of 
judges, thi s was an honorahle feat 
in itself. 

I can personally vouch for the 
maturit y claim . However, I havc no 
oflinion as to whether attending 
Reve lle actua ll y hinders one's 
chances of dating. I'll take 
Meaghan and Rosanne's word for it 
because, as Reve ll ians themselves, 
they should know. 

This fo llowi ng interview wi th 
Charlc~ was recorded last week : 
Mary: Congratulations on win-
ning, Charles. How does that 
make you feel? 

Charles: Emharrassed. 
What do you like to do In your 
free time? 

I'm creati ve and I enjoy sharing 
my ti me wi th other peofl le. I like 
popular mus ic, elus, ica l, and jazz. I 
also like to ,ketch wi ld life and peo-
[lIe. 
What Is your Ideal date? 

Candlelight din ner for two at the 
heach . Of course the wind would 
flro hab ly hlow out the candles and 
the sand wou ld prohably get in 
your ... well ... I gvc~s I'd bring a 
towel. 
What is your best quality? 

I'm honc~ t and friendly. 
What do you look for in a 
woman? 

A good sense of hu mor, hon-
esty. Someone who dreams and 
someone who's oflen to new adven -
tures .... 
Someone who would sleep with 
you on the first date? 

That's why I wou Id bri ng a 
towel ... ha hOi , j ust kidding. 
Do you have a history of Insanity? 

No. 
How about a prison record? 

No.

DATE RAPE: 
Clear definition of 
rape is ambiguous 
Continued from page 11 
sexual assault - rape. 

h is diflicultto prove charges of 
sexual assault against a person with 
whom one may have prev ious ly 
had a fri endly re lationship, espe-
ciall y when the established intima-
cy includes an all owance for cer-
tain sexual behav ior. Because of 
thi s, date rape is one of the most 
challenging cri mes to prove. 

According to Colin Murrey, a 
prosecut i ng allorney for Sa n 
Diego's District Allorney's ofllce, 
there are no spedal laws l'or prose-
cuting date rapists. The crime is 
always class i lied as ra pe. 

"Rape cases arc uni que hecause 
the cooperat ion of the victim .is 
special and crucial." says Murrey. 
"The ordeal that women have to go 
through is traumati c." 

Then: arc three elcment~ th at 
must occur in order for the Distr ict 
Attorney's omce to he ahle to pros-
ecute a rape crime, accordi ng to 
Murrey. The !lrst is that penetration 
must occur, no matter how slight , 
of the victim. The second i, that it 
mus t not h<.: consent ual, and lhe 
third is that it must be done by 
means of force, vio lence, du ress, 
menace, or fear. 

"The de!lning clement of rape is 
that the guilt or innocence of the 
fle rpetralOr does not depend on 
their intent , but on the suhjective 
intent of the victim," said Murrey. 

However, because thi, is di 1'11-
cult 10 [l rov<.:, circu mstance, sur-
rounding a crimc ort en come into 
fl lay, and th i, is where the alleged 

perpetrators and the victim 's right s 
are often compromised through 
authorit y mi sinterpretation and 
skepticism. 
Date Rape Drugs 

In cases involving intoxication 
or the victim, the substance in 
question is oft en alcohol. Recently, 
though, drugs originall y designed 
as potent sleep aids that have an 
incapacitating effect have become 
more commonplace. 

' 'They have the special quality 
of extracting full cooperation with-
out memory," says Wahlig. "All the 
predators out there now have thi s 
tool." 

Most pcople know that even 
when sex is consentual wi th a 
minor, it can still be prosecuted as 
stat utory rape. However, most peo-
ple do not rea li ze that a person who 
is intox icated beyond the point of 
reason , cannot legally give consent 
to sex . 

" It is against the law to have sex 
wit h anyonc who is drunk and who 
cannot give consent," said Dr. Brian 
J. Murray, director of Student Health 
Serv ices at UCSD. "There have been 
ca,es that have hcen [lrosecuted. The 
victim i~ incapahle or resisting ,ex 
by an intoxicating subject and he 
knows this. He knows that she can't 
meaningfully decide whether or not 
she C.1Il have sex." 

Often times, cases th at arc [l ro,-
ccuted are d iffic ult to prove. 
because of t he "swiss chcl!se 
clrcc t" that intoxication has on thl! 
memory of the victim. The victim 
may rememher that she was not 
compli ant, or that she flut ufl SO ll l": 

re~istance, but she may not rcml!l1l -
her how she got there, or detai ls of 
the event. 

"Sometimes these wom..:n do 

The UCSD Guardian 

not make good witnesses so it can 
be hard to prosec ute," said Dr. 
Murray. ''They can' t rememher 
who, when and wher..: . Sometimes, 
shc is not even aware herself that it 
was ra[l": :' 

The two major drugs tied 10 date 
rape arc Rooties and GHB. A less-
er known drug is Ketamine, a gen-
eral anesthetic for humans, hut . 
which i~ also used as a cat tranqui 1-
izer. Often pcr[letralOrs will steal 
from veterinarian ofll ces and use 
them in the same way that tradi -
ti onal date rape drugs arc admini ,-
teredo through drink, .

were Ii \'C reponed Roh pnol case,

''The number ha, probab ly

Murrey. "1 Add it ionall yl Rohy pnol 
case, arc often not reported." This 
is usually attributed to the fau that 
victims an: not alway, aware of 
what has hapflencd.

never felt scared or any-

Chad Compton

"When I had friends li v-
ing in the Muir dorms, any-

kind of scary. Of course 
when [ lived in Warren they 
had us locked in . You 
couldn ' t get in even if you 
lived there."

" I think UCSD is real 
safe, especially with that 
bike-cop guy that 's out there 
making sure no one gets hit 
in the ankle wi th skate-
bards o'r is riding their bike 
where they shouldn ' t he. I 
think it's his involvement on 
thi s campus that reall y 
makes it a safe place." 

Matt Tregidga 
Warren Senior 

"l've never had any ki nd 
of problems at U SD. I 
walk around campus at night 
by myself and to the parking 
lot. I don ' t recl like there's 
any danger but , then again , 
I'm one of those people who 
doesn't really care. [ think

The Editor's Soapbox 
Editor Needs Support On a Mission To 
"Frolic In a Huge Pool of Jell-O" 
By Scott Yag.r Co-Hiatus Editor 

[ had thi s idea the other day, and 
I thought I'd share it with everyone 
who is out there dodging rai ndrops 
and stressing out over final s. An 
idi:a so great, so wonderful - well , 
I'll just ge t on with it. 

I was si lting around the 
Guardian offices with Mr. Nick 
Runco, our es teemed Onl ine 
Ed itor, and we hit upon a precious 
nugget of wisdom. How cool 
wou ld it he to swim in a swimming 
pool Ii lied wi th Je ll -a ? 

We' re not talking about a plastic 
kiddie pool with a lillie bit of gelat in 
th rown into it , we 're talking about a 
full -sized pool with divi ng hoards 
and maybl: even a Je ll-O slidl:. 

So you may be silting there 
,thinking, "Why would an yo ne 
want a pool li llcd with Jcll-O'!" 
Well , why the he ll not ? I think it 'd 
be great to do a cannonhall inlO 
Je ll -a . Would yuu sink into it or 
just kind of houllce ? These arc the 
questions we wallt answered. Ca ll 
it pure inqui siti veness. 

or cour" , therc arc logistical 
rrohlems associated wi th such a 
task. 

First off, it would take a hell of 
a lot of Je ll -O hox" 10 fi ll up a 
pool. Even if we used that generic 
gelati n SlUff. which is cheaper, it 
, till would he reall y cxpcnsive . 

Plus. how do we know wh~n we 
hay..: enough hoxes? I don't know if 
Iherc's , uch a thing a, adding (00 
much Je ll -O 10 water, hut we're 
looking for the perlcl.: t consistency. 

Another prohlem would be the 
water lemrerature . orrna lly, you 

have to boi I the water, add the Jell-
0 , before cooling it in the refri ger-
ator. The trick is fi guring out how 
10 boi l a pool. 

I'm not really familiar with pool 
heating systems, but you can heat a 
spa to ncar boiling, so why not a 
pool '! Sure, it would take a lot of 
power, hut it wou ld he worth it. We 
were also thinking we could usc a 
~ ort of heat -absorbing tarp to put 
over the pool duri ng the day light 
hours and get thc sun to help us. 
The prohlem is, neither Nick nor I 
know how to make one of those. 

Cooling the Jell -O would be 
tricky, as well . PUlling ice in the 
Jc ll-O wou ld help, bu t that wou ld 
take a lot of ice. Liqu id nitrogen 
definit ely wouldn 't work . 

Perhaps if wc coo led the poo l. 
put icc in it . and let it sit overnight. 
That might not work , hut it seems 
like we'd need sOlll ething else that 
would make it co ld without conta-
minating Ih Jell-a . 

Finally, the la,t prohlem, the 
main problem, is linding a poo l. If 
I had one in Illy hackyard, there 
would bc no problem, hut I don' t. 
So wherc arc we goi ng to get a 
large poo l that somehody woul d he 
willing to let u, lill with Je ll -a '! 

Canyonview would he great, hut 
somehow I douht the powers that 
he at U SD would go along with 
such a schemc - although water 
polo ga mcs anti , wil li Ill ects would 
be prelly intercsting. 

So, Ni ck and I have decided to 
try a, hard as we can to make· thi s 
dream into a reali ty, and wc're turn -

ing to you, the studenls of UCS D, 
for help. 

We can ' t do it alone, so we need 
people who think we have a good 
idea and want to be a parl of it. We 
especially need people who know 
how we could make a heat-ahso rb-
ing tarp. Also, the entire Guardiall 
sports staff should get involved. 

Imagi ne a srring day nex t quar-
ter, with a huge group of students 
froli cking in a giant p 01 of Jell -a . 

We were thinking it wou ld be 
cool to make it a big eve nt, maybe 
even gelling radio stati ons involved. 
When the station STAR 100.7 had 
those people on the ro ller coaster, 
look how much publicity they got. 
Sponsoring a huge pool full of Je ll-
a would he great for puHicity' 

We could have bands playing, a 
huge barbel.: ue and beer Ilowin g. 
Maybe it would be a good allrac-
tion 10 have in conjuncti on with the 
Sun God Festi val. 

While you' re reading this in class 
instead of li stening to that horing 
r rofessor, think ahout our idea. If 
you want to be a rart of it, e-mail us 
or somcthi ng. With your help, we 
can all swi min a big pool of Je ll-a .

"For my roommates and I, the

that everyone stays safe at the pany. 
This means that if anyone gets out of

TOO SHORT: 
Women awakened 
from a dream season 
Continued from page 24 
bcing completcly partisan. 

Despite being outnumbered in 
both players and support , UCSD 
came out determi ned to compete 
with SI. Benedict , and compete it 
did, as the women overcame a 
number of first-half turnovers to 
trail just 3 1-24 at intermission. 

"We rea lly didn ' t play that 
well in the first half. We had a lot 
of turnovers," McC lure noted. 
"But still , we were only down 7. 
We all thought , hey, we can do 
thi s." 

Good shooting kept UCSD 
close as the women converted on 
50 percent of their attempts from 
behind the arc . Janessa Bayda and 

Tristen Teasdale each shot we ll 
from downtown, as the duo com-
bined to make four of six three-
poimers. 

But as the 26-point final mar-
gi n of vic tory indicate~ , the sec-
ond half did not go UCSD's way. 

Relying heavily on its inside 
game, St. Benedict successfull y 
fed its posts, eliminating Triton 
hopes of an upset. 

Senior Summer Begley led 
UCSD in scoring, contributing 9 
pints in addition to her 5 
rebounds. 

The loss was one of just four 
experienced by the women this 
season, the first of this calendar 
year. The team won a school-
record 23 games and equaled last 
year 's playoff success by advanc-
ing to the second round of the 
Di vision III tournament. Undeni -
abl y, thi s was a remarkable year.

RESPECT: 
Tritons succumb to 
two more powers 
Continued from page 23 
as Pacific was forced to play its 
best volleyball throughout the 
match. 

Game one featured the type of 
play UCSD has been trying to put 
together all season. 

From serving to defense to the 
offensive attack, the Tritons 
looked like a Di vision I team as 
they jumped out to an early 4-
point lead. 

The Tigers, however, would 
not go down without a fi ght. 
Using it s height on the frontline, 
Paci fi c closed the gap aod forced 
a ti meout from McFarland. A solo 
block by Seckington had the 
crowd on its fee t and the Tritons 

back on track. 
The Tiger rally would be too 

little, too late as UCSD closed out 
the first game, 15-12, and gave 
the Tritons one of their best wins 
of the year. 

"The first game we played 
well ," Secki ngton said. "We 
served them LOugh and passed 
real well. Our success has come 
and gone wi th our serving and 
pass ing. Both of those things 
were on and we were out there 
having fun ." 

The loss in game one lit a fire 
beneath Paci fic a~ it grabbed the 
next two games, 15-7 and 15-4. 

The TriLOns cominued to apply 
pressure th roughout the fourt h 
game wi th Yarri s, Woods and 
Mount all playing some of thei r

ever, it would not be enough, as

the Tritons a 12-2 advantage goi ng 
into the seventh inning. 

In the bottom of the seventh the 
Tritons added 2 more runs to thei r 
lead. 

Although Moravian was able to 
get 2 runs in the top of the eighth 
inning, it was as d ose as Moravian 
would get. Triton pitcher SCOIl Jen-
son scaled the 14-4 victory by 
striking out two men in the top of 
the ninth. 

Although Friday's 14-4 victory 
was sweet for the Tritons, Sunday's 
game left a sour aftertaste. 

UCSD came imo Sunday 's 
Illatch hoping to SLOp Division III 
powerhouse Montclair State. How-
ever, thi ngs didn ' t go as planned, as 
the Tritons were defeated, 12-5. 

After thrce-and-half-innings the 
Triton~ found themselves down to 
the Red Hawks, 5-0. In the bottom 
of the fourth, the Tritons showed a 
lillie life, ,coring 2 runs. 

Righ t fie lder Eri e Schramm 
responded wi th a bomb over the 
leff -field fence, the lirst run for 
UCSD. Dc~ig nat.ed hiller Eli 
Reichline followed Sc hramlll 's

for a bu~y week

Tritons Tank CSULB 
SWAMP 'EM: UCSD sank the 4gers, winning 
four of 'ix events, including the men 's eight 
By Kevin McLaughlin 
Co-ASSOCIa te Spor ts Editor 

Like other di>lance races, Ibe 
sport of crew is a mailer largely 
made of IC;II11work and menial ~ ta­
mina (though a lillie phy -
kal , trenglh never hurts). 

Achieving Ihat chem-
iSlry and Ihe highesl leve l 
or fi t n es ~ takes time. The 
early ~lages of Ihe season 
arc the g round~ upon 
which a successfu l season 
is bui It , and thi s weekend 's 
race againsl CS Long 
Beach was anolher occa~ion for the 
men 's and women 's crew , quads to 
smooth oul all the wri nkles before 
enlering more compelil ive racing. 

For both Ihe men and Ihe 
women il was a suc<.:essful week-
end, racing against a 4ger team 
wilh some skill bUI a rather slim 
roSier. 

Taking Ihe water al Long Beach 
Marine Siadium, si te or the races of 
the 1932 Olympics, Ihe men's var-
sily ei ghl plowed past Long Beach 
wilh case, jumping OU I 10 a quick 
sta rt and fini shing II seconds 
ahead of Ihe 4ger~ . 

·'Th.:y delinilcly had Ihe size 
and our coach had us hyped up," 
second-year rower Paul Dodge 
said . "I\s illumed out , we seemed 
to have comparable power and we 
rowed more efti cienlly." 

The men's varsilY four found 
the go ing a bit more dilTieult. 

,.---

CS LB\ ~qu ad wa~ manned by 
four of the race rs from it ~ e ight -
man team, which is usually Ihe 
slro ngesl SCI of rowers. Though Ibe 
Triton~ had thc lead al the midway 

po inl, the 4gers pa ·s.:d 
the lll in Ihe laiC go ing to 
wi n by four seconds. 

CSULB proved capa-
ble again in Ihe fo urs, as 
il s novi<.:e sq uad beal a 
mi slake- plagued Triton 
leam. However, in novice 
eighl compeliti on , 
UCSO 's men nearl y 

malched Ihe performance of Ihei r 
varsilY counlerparts, whipping the 
4gers hy nine seconds. 

"Ou r novice program thi s year 
is really sirong," Dodge said. 

For Ihe women , CSULB again 
wasn' l able 10 field a complete 
team, providing Ihe va rsilY women 
with only a leam of four to race 
aga inst. The Trilons showed Iheir 
slrength by splilling up their open-
division varsity eight boal and lin-
ishing both hoats ahead of Ihe 4ger 
women. Thc "A" boal came in 
more than 13 seconds ahead of 
CS LB . 

"You pUI thai logether wilh our 
cight second win over Irvi ne .. . and 
it 's a pretty good start to Ihe 'ca-

~o n ," Women's Head Coach Jack 
Vallerga said. "Long Beach can he 
prelly dangerous. I'm surprised we 
handled Ihem as we ll as we did.

Tritons Suffer First Loss 
SLUGGED: Although UCSD has dominated UC Santa Cruz 
in virtually every sport this year, the Slugs got their revenge 
By Bill Burger 
Staff Writer 

Despile winni ng one oUI or Iwo matche , 
il was not a good weekend for Ihe UCSD 
men's lenni s lea m. 

On Friday Ihe Tri lons struggled 
to a 4-3 win over Oivision I Boston 
College. UCS D Ihen Iraveled 10 
Sanla Cruz to lake on Ihe Banana 
Slugs. Thi s ma lch didn't go nearl y 
as well . as the Trilons were domi-
nated from beg inning to end in a 7-
o drubhing. 

The firsl malch was su mmed up 
perfectly by coach Brian Turner. 

"We lei Ihem in a malch they shouldn ' t 
have been in," Turn.:r said or hi s leam 's per-
fonnance. 

The Trilons wonlwo of Ihe Ihree douhles 
sets 10 cap ture Ihe mat l: hcs' doubles poi nt. 
This proved 10 be the diflerence as Ihe six 
singles sets were split , three ror Ihe Trilons 
and Ihree for Ihe Eagles. 

The singles malches included a narrow 
wi n for Sieve Shabcl al No. I singles. 7-5, 6-
4, and an impre sive victory for Anthony 
Mclicharek, 6-3, 6-2. 

'The Illatch was a lot cl oser Ihan il 
looked ." Melicharek said. "I was just able 10 
win the big points when I needed to." 

Tbis maleh was al Ihe mercy of MOlher 
Nature as Ihe wind was blow ing lI eree ly for 
most of Ihe da y al UCSD's North Courts. 11 
was nOI a rare occurrence 10 sec balls Ilying 
inl o Ihe fences or even over them . 

Despile Iheir lackadaisical play. Ihe Tri -
Ions managed 10 escape wilh Ihe victory and 
lemporarily run Iheir rel:ord 10 a perfect 4-0. 

That perfec li on was broughllo a screec h-
ing hah Ihe nex t day as UC Santa Cruz dom-

inaled in a 7-0 thrashing . 
In doubles, the Tritons were basically 

overmatched as they losl all th ne pro-sets. 
This marked Ihe firs l lime Ihi s year Ihul Ihe 
Tritons were unable 10 win Ihe doubles 

point. 
The singles matches starled OUI 

well for Ihe Trilons as Ihey gOt OUI 
10 early leads in five of Ihe six sels. 
However, UCSD was not ab le 10 
sust ain Ihese efforls as it eventually 
fe ll in all six malches. 

Shabel managed 10 win Ihe fin;1 
set of his malch, 6-3, bel' n:: losing 
Ihe neX I two, 3-6, 1-6, 10 former UC 

Berkeley player Brian Cummings. Emi l 
Mihel had a hard Lime at No. 2 singles as he 
10Sl, 0-6, 3-6. 

The NO. 3 and 4 si ngles malches hOlh 
fo llowed th e trend of close first sels fol -
lowed by hiowoul sec.:ond ones. Ken Liu losl 
hi s first sci, 6-7, in a tie breaker before los-
in g, 1-6, in the second. Jason Hipp losl his 
lirsl sci at No. 4 si ngles, 5-7, and Ihell was 
shutout. 6-0, in the second set. Melicharek 
was lough in bOlh of hi s sels. bU I unfortu -
nalely losl a c lose match, 4-6, 6-7. Kai 
Miller played consislenlly as well , bUI a l ~() 
carne up ShOl1, 3-6, 3-6. 

Turner, as well as many of hi s players. 
sighled inexperience as Ihe reason for Ihe 
poor resu It . 

"We have to improve our match tough-
ness," Turner said. 

Thi s tough loss ran CSO's record to a 
still-impressive 4-1 on the young s.:ason. 
The Tritons look forward 10 a poss ihle 
remalch wilh Ihe Banana Slugs in regional 
play and hope 10 usc thi s loss as a slepping

More Division I Woes 
MORAL VICTORY: UCSD took one game from Pacific, but 
was downed by the Tigers and the Cardinal of Stanford 
By Steve Walsh 
Senior Staff Writer 

For most teams, coming off a second win 
o f the season, Ihe nex i opportunilY to gel on 
Ihe 1100r can nOI come too soon wilh the 
hopes of continuing momentum. 
That is, unless your nex i opponent 
is the defending Di vision I Nation-
al Champion. 

Thi s was Ihe challenge that 
fat:ed the UCSO men's voll eyball 
leam Ihis pasl weekend as it hosted 
defending champion Stanford on 
Fri day. The Tritons were Ihen 
forced to come back on Salurday 10 
square off wi th the Uni versit y of Pacific. 

While Sianford has nOI proven 10 he Ihe 
superpower il was lasl season, Ihe ard inal 
did come 10 RIMAC as the nalion's o. 7 
rank\!d squad . Undaunt ed by Ihe challenge 
of locking horns wilh Stanford, Ihe Tritons 
looked 10 bring Ihe momen tum of Iheir wi n 
agai nst Ca l State San Bernardino illlo Ihe 
gym and shock Ihe Cardinal, which was 
coming (lIT a tough live-game los, 10 C. 

While seller Kurl Seckinglon had risen 10 
Ihe occasion againsl San Bernardino, il was 
seni or opposile hiller Ryan Woods who look 
over as leader of the UCS O allack. A con-
sislenl gO-IO hiller, Woods handled Ihe 
majorit y of the swings for th e Trilons and, 
despite the big hlod of Ihe Cardinal. man-
aged t ) record ~ mall: h-high I H ki li s . 

With Woods and fe llow senior Jon Yarri s 
operaling around Ihe Sianford frontline, 
UCSD look a 7-6 lead and had the Trilon 
failhfullhinking upse t. 

However, Ihe Cardinal was not jusl hand-
ed Ihe Nalional Championship trophy lasl 

sea~on and was not about to allow the over-

matched Trilons 10 sleal a ga me wilhout a 
fi gh t. 

Making usc of its size advanlage on the 
fronlline, Ihe Cardinal wen l on a 7-poinl run 
Ihal sto le Ihe wind from Ihe Triton sails. A 

limeoul hy Head Coach Duncan 
McFarland and a series of substi tu-
lions were nOI enough as Sian ford 
closed Oul game one, 15-8. 

"One of Ihe things we talked 
aboul was coming OUI and gelling a 
good sta rt agai nst Stanford and we 
did Ihal," Se<.:kinglon said. "We 
ball led wilh Ihem from Ihe Slart ." 

After opening Ihe second game 
by gi ing up 9 unanswered poinls, the Tri -
Ions appeared on Ihe verge of being blown 
oul before Iheir defense Hwoke. Middle 
blockers Guy Mount and Alan Dawber man-
;Igcd 10 get Iheir hands on the Stanford 
att acks and Ihe UCSD backrow begun dig-
ging b'l lI s Ihal had been kill s just minutes 
earlier. 

Wilh Ihe defense working, Ihe Trilons cut 
Ihe lead 10 5 points, but il was too lillie 10 
late as Ihe Card inal look a Iwo-game lead, 
15-7. 

Playi ng tough for IWO games was all Ihe' 
Trilons <.:O uld mUSler as Sian ford pushed its 
game inlo overdrivc and closed oul the 
malch, 15-1. 

Following Ihe ' loss 10 Sianford, UCSO 
rebou nded emoliuna lly against Universi lY 
of Paci lic to take il s second game fr m a 
Division I opponent. 

From Ihe opening serve of Ihe malch, the 
Trilons appeared on a miss ion 10 ga in some

TRITONS 
TAKE TWO

stomped Augustana College

record above .500 

[ have a problem. Not bei ng 
broke - that's beyond a prob-
lem. It 's hecome part of my 
identity. My problem is just a 
derivative of that. [t hit s me at 
least once a week, and the pain 
is m'lssive. [ have no money, 
and thus [ cannot go skiing.

Full Extension: Triton hurler Allison Jacobs rears back to fire during UCSD's victory. 

When [ grew up, there were 
a lot of drought years in alifor-
nia, and [ got used to bad condi -
tions. 

This year, tliat 's all changcd. 
There 's snow! A few years ago [ 
fIgured , cool, there's never any 
decent snow in California. I 
never have any money, so I'll 
just move to San Diego for 
school and pick up some cheap-
er, outdoor, sun-related sport. 

However, it never stuck. Ski-
ing is something I've had trou-
ble trying to part with. [ wear 
my skiing beenies all the time. 
I've got posters around the 
house. Occasionally in my car 
when [ hit a downhi II, I'll crank 
up my air conditioning, throw 
my seat into a tuck , and start 
swervi ng through traffic like 
gates on a mountain. 

I only went up thi s year 
once, to Sugar Bowl near Lake 
Tahoe, and it was pitiful. This 
was before "The Boy" had 
unleashed his fury, and [ had to 
spend the short December day 
dealing with wind and ice and 
not much /laky white stuff. 

[ miss the wind whipping 
across my face making my nose 
run, that nervous feeling trying 
to walk down stairs with my 
boots sti ll buckled and head-
plants that would make Her-
mann Meier blush. 

I' ve been through it all many 
times before and I've been 
missing all that. . 

The only time I can go these 
days, however, is when some-
one else is treating. I mean, I 
can't get a full-time job, my free 
time is unquestionably commit-
ted to the Guardian and my 
spare change is well spent every 
weekend on the Kill Kevin's 
Liver Fund. 

A few years ago, I thought 
30 bucks was outrageous. Now, 
50 is becoming standard. 

Hell, if I had 50 bucks to 
throw around, I'd waste it on 
something worthwhile 
maybe even groceries. 

SUNBURN: Most look at a weekend in San Diego as a nice vacation, but the Auggies from fllinois 
found their hosts from UCSD to be rather unfriendly as the Triton took both games, 8-2 and 4-3 
By Jake Gordon 
Staff Writer 

Spring break is com ing and 
you're headed to the ci ty of sin , Las 
Vegas. 

It 's dark , you' ve had a couple 
drinks and you wobble into a high-
class casino to gamble away your 
life savings. Eight hours and 
numerous Keno games later, you 
wander out and are met with an 
unforeseen problem. The sun is out 
in full force . You stumble blindly in 
the blazing heat, unable see your 
hand in front of your face. 

This is how Augustana College 
must have felt as it visited San 
Diego last Saturday. From frosty 
Illinois, Augustana plays all of it s 
games inside cozy, indoor softball 
faci lities. 

In -their first game outdoors all 
year, the girls from Illinois had no 
chance against the mighty UCSD 

softha ll juggern au t, much less the 
clements. Rebounding from a cou-
ple rough outings , - the Tri tons 
pounded the Auggies wi th 
20 hits over two games, 
win ning the doubleheader 
,l:l-2 and 4-3. 

In the first game, pitch-
er Allison Jacobs resumed 
her season dominance of 
opposing batters, giving. 
up only 2 runs on 6 hits. 

While the Auggies ' 
offense wa:-. stifled, UCSD 's 
offense came fast and furious. The 
infield for UCSD was on fire as 
third baseman Jeanine Cordero 
went 2 for 4 with 3 RBIs, first base-
man Natalie Andrade went 2 for 2 
with 2 runs scored and shortstop 
Erin Bridges went 2 for 4 with a 
nln batted in. All three were excel-
lent defensively as well , with 
Bridges making numerous stellar 

play~ at :-. horl. 
The outfield took over the hit-

ting in the second game. 
Triton fre~hman and 

right li elder Jami Howe ll 
had her fIrst big game, 
smacki ng 2 hits and bat-
ting in a run , while center 
lielder Cynthia Sam and 
left fielder Kelsey Bennett 
both went 2 for 3. Desig-
nated hitter Shannon 
Tracy had a monster game 

as well, with 2 doubles and a run 
batted in . 

Taking advantage of weak Aug-
gie pitching, UCSD had more hits 
than in the first game, I I in all. 
Still , it found it hard to string hits 
together and only scored half as 
many runs as it did in game one. 

Four runs wou ld be more than 
necessary for pitcher Erin Flanigan 
as she shut down Augustana, gi vi ng 

up only 2 earned runs on 4 hits. 
With the~e lwo wins, UCSD raised 
its record to 7-5. 

H[ think exce llent defense was 
the key for our wins," Flanigan 
said . "Eri n [Bridges] made some 
great plays, saving a lot of hits for 
me. Our hilling was good, too. Jea-
nine [Cordero] waited on a couple 
change-ups and drove in some runs 
and Jami [Howell] hit real well 
too." 

[I' these games were any indica-
ti on, UCSD's potent offense seems 
very capable of churning out hits 
and runs. 

With just a couple games left 
before lhe Spring Rebel games in 
Florida, Coach Patty Gercken's 
squad seems to be hilling mid-sea-
son stride just in time. 

UCSD's nex t match is at home 
agai nst the Whittier College Poets 
on Thursday at 5 p.m. 

, Tritons Fall In Second Round of Tourney 
ST. BENEDICT: 
Using height and the 
homecourt advantage, 
the Blazers won out 
By Jeff Bassett 
Staff Writer 

I Samuel 17:49 reads: "And 
David put his hand in hi s bag, and 
took thence a stone, and slung it , . 
and smote the Philistine in hi s fore-
head, and he fell upon hi s face to 
the earth." 

David, perhaps with God 's 
assistance. got pretty lucky. The 

Philistine, i.e. Goli ath , was over II 
feet tall , and if Dave hadn ' t hit him 
smack in the forehead, the big guy 
probably would have 
been a little upset. 
Unfortunately, the 
times are no longer 
Biblica l; Goli ath 
doesn't always fall. 

On Saturday night 
t he best season in 
UCSD women's bas-
ketball hi tory came 
to an end. The women, up against 
one of the top teams in the nation, 
were unable to slay the giant.

Minnesota was the site, and the

home-court advantage to pull away 

from the Tritons in 
the second half, 
securing a 73-47 wi n. 

The il1~ide play of 
SI. Ben 's big women 
was the di ITerence, 
and the size disparity 
ultimately proved to 
be too much. 

"Their posts were 
the three largest g irls we played

said. "They were unstoppable even

This Tuesda UCSD will

The slats agreed, as the Blazers ' 

three starting post players tallied 36 
poi nts and 18 rebounds. 

The second-round playoff loss 
not on ly brought an end to the Tri -
tons' season, bu t their record-
breaking 16-game winning streak 
as well. 

The game certainl y had the
