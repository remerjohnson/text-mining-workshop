Education 'Abroad Program 
Students go far- -really far 

by Mary O'Coaaor 
Staff Writer 

Tally-ho and they're off. 
'Ibis year, M UCSD students are 

attending classes in foreign 
countries. They are participating 
in the University of California's 
Education Abro.d Program 
(EAP). wbich 'eM1Il .. shdenta to 
spend their junior, and scmetimes 
senior year in such exotic settings 
ad Europe, Africa or the far East. 

Most 9f the students now over-
seas or in Mexico applied for ad-
mission to the program in their 
sophomore year. They were 
required to have had two years of 
college level language or its 
equivalent (exceptions were ap-
plicants to the United Kingdom and 
Scandinavian countries), a 3.0 
grade point average at the time of 
application and the approval of a 
campuS selection committee. 

After submitting an application, 
EAP hopefuls undergJ an in-
terview conducted by EAP COOl'-
dinalar and foreign student advisor 
JoM Walsh, faculty coordinator 
Dr. Herbert Yoljt, EAP returnees 
and a professor chosen to ascertain 
linguistic profiency. The purpose 
of this ~ is to assess the 
applicant's maturity and 
motivation. 

EAP students attend their 
respective foreign universities for 
the regular nine month school 
year. The only exceptions .are 
students who chooae Scandinavian 
schools. Since most UC campuses 
do not offer Swedish or Norwegian, 
exchange students to Sweden and 
NCII'W81 leave two montba earJ7 
and spend five houn a day, five 
days a week learning the language 
before classes begin. 

Costs for the year range from 
$4700 to Mexico aty to $6500 in 
Sweden. These estiinates include 
transportation, room and board, 
travel and tuition. 

Here, tbere, everywbere 
According to EAP COW1selor 

Hannelore Malone, the greatest 
number of UCSD exchange 
students go to the United Kingdom· 
'Ibis is because the British schools 
are sclence~riented, and "the 
~tofwnguagep~~nwjwrt 
isn't there." Next in popularity are 

~in,- France, and Germany, 
preferred by students interested in 
the IOdaI sciences, Uterature and 
lanpage. 

Malone cited the advantage of 

spending a year abroad. "Students 
go for the academic experience of 
foreign schools, to improve their 
linguistic abWtie, and to establish 
an international perspective," she 
said. "What they get is the chance 
to experience We in another 
culture." 

And sOmetimes that culture 
differs greatly from Southern 
Californian, USA. Writes a Revelle 
student nC)w at Grenoble, Fran-
ce ... "Life here is pretty alien, not 
all 'life as we know it'. I don't know 
how astronomers can use that 
phrase on a cosmic scale when it 
doesn't even apply to the western 
hemisphere." 

"I WMIUl go bome" 
Eric Rodli, an 'enthusiatic 

returnee from Sweden, admits to 
"October despair, " which he 

defines as ''the homesickness that 
hits you when you realize the sun 
won't be coming out all winter." 
His assessment is echoed in an 
October letter from Grenoble ; 
"It's fucking cold here - I have to 
wear gloves when I embroider. I 
miss California - shit, I even miss 
the freeways." 

Rodll insists, though, that after 
one year Sweden seemed like 
home, and that returning to UCSD 
was almost as traumatic as 
beginning at the University of 
Lund. He arrived in Sweden 
knowing nothing of the language. 
He attended the intensive language 
program and by the time school 
began he was competent enough to 
take all of his classes in Swedish. 
He found the University of Lund

7 hopefuls 
to replace 
Murphy 

• remain 
by Mark Stadler 

A search committee has pared 
the number of candidates for the 
UCSD Vice<hancellor of Student 
Affairs position to seven and ex-
pects, according to one committee 
member, to forward its final 
recommendations to Chancellor 
McElroy by the middle of next 
month. 

The search committee, which is 
composed of administrators, 
students, faculty and staff, met 
during the past sununer to con-
sider the 160 applicants vying to fill 
the position which has been oc-
cupied by UCSD physical 
education head Howard Hunt since 
April . 

The seven finalists-all white 
males-include two UCSD ad-
ministrators : Associate Vice-
chancellor of Student Affairs 
Richard Whitehill and Assistant to 
the Vice<hancellor of Academic 
Affairs Tom Hull. 

Other Candidates 
The other candidates are David 

Bell, Vice1)resident of Student 
Affairs at Cal state, Fresno; 
OIarles McClure, Assistant Vice-
chancellor of Campus Affairs at 
UCLA; Edward Shaw, Assistant 
Vice<hancellor, Student Services 
and Development, at UCLA; 
Melvin Bernstein, political science 
lecturer and former assistant Vice-
chancellor of Student Affairs on 
Educational Relations at UC 
Irvine; and Richard Armitage, 
Vice1)resident of Student Services 
at Ohio State. . 

The person finally selected will 
replace George Murphy, Vice-
chancellor and Dean of Student 
Affairs here since 1967-who 
resigned in April, for personal 
reasons. McElroy appointed Hunt 
as temporary vice<hancellor and 
pledged a nationwide search to 
replace Murphy. 

The search committee, which 
was picked by McElroy and 
represents a cross~tion of the 
campus community, has in-
terviewed Whitehill, Hull , Bell and 
McOure so far. The final interview 
is set for Nov. 3. 

The committee will then forward 
"less than seven and more than 
one name" to McElroy, according 
to committee chairperson Murray 
Goodman , who chairs the 
chemistry department. McElroy 
will then make the final decision, 
subject to the approval of the UC 
Board of Regents. 

The new . Vice<hancellor 
probably won't asswne his duties 
until late Winter or early Spring 
quarter because of relocation 
problems, unless he is from UCSD, 
committee member Marsha 
Harris said earlier this week. 

Narrowed to 35 
Harris, who is student co-cllair of 

the Advisory Committee on 
Student Fee Programs , em-
pbasized that the speed with which 
a candidate could asswne the vice-
chancel or duties is not a factor in 
the committee's considerations. 

The original 160 candidates were 
narrn " tn ~ !Iv two sub-
committees of the search panel, 
then the number was further 
narrowed to eight by i.bc entire

Welcome to Middle Earth, or the world of 
ToIkien. 

ToIk1en-.v1ll the name sounds magical. 
Derived from, tile German Tolkeihn, "Toll" 
meanlnc ''mad.'' ''kelJm'' transla~ to 
"brave," Jolin Ronald ReueI . Tollt4en, best 
known for hiI bQob 'I1Ie Hobbit and Tbe 
lArd of the RIap. seemed to embody the 
"best" of both attriblUl. 

Tolklen W81 born In the Orange Free state 
of South Africa on Jan. 3, 1892. His mother, 
Mabel Tolkien, took Tolkien and his brother 
Hilary back to England at an early age, 
shortly before the death of bia father. 

Mabel Tollden bad a pronounced influence 
on her son. She taugta him Latin and Old 
F.nglisb as a child and instilled in him his 
love of languages (of which he created 
several by the age of nine). She was the 
"molder" of her son; he accepted all she 
had to offer. 

Uke his mother, Tolkien loved ~ 
countryside, the many events that make up 
life. He shared her enthusiasm in a1moat all 
regards-iocluding religion. 

Mabel To1Itien ~d converted to Roman 
~thoUcism at a late age . She embraced the 
religion whole-heartedly, estranging many 
of the Tolkien relatives, a precarious thing 
to do (as she and her family were living off 
their charity). Aware of a continuing illness, 
she made 'arrangements for l}er sons to 
"keep faith" by Uving under the care of a 
certain Father Morgan. Her death in 11104, 
when Tolklen was 12, insured his 

arran~ment, and If anything, strengthened 
his reUgious convictions. 

Under Father Morgan Tolkien renewed 
his interest in languages. His application to 
the subject enabled him to gain entrance to 
Exeter CoDege at Oxford. By all accounts 
Tolkien had a uand time at that bastion of 
intellectuality. The only thing that marred 
his stay was the outbreak of war, which 
accoun¥d for his small graduating class in 
1915. Tollden left school wiUl first class 
honors In English Language and Literature 
and went to war. 

Ommissioned as a temporary Second 
litlutenant, Tollden was subjected to the 
oorrors of the bloodiest war in history. As 
head of a .pi8toon be led his men in the Battle 
of Somme. To1lden's outfit was one of the 
luckier one., that lived througb the storming 
of the German bunkers. On the ume day 
over 50,000 other BritIsh IOIdien died, and 
this figure ~as b~ a tri~ in the red bucket 
for the follcnring. weea totals. 

Tolkien was "lucky" In the sense that he 
contracted trench fever and missed out on • 
much of the rest of the war. Perhaps the 
only good that might be sifted out of the 
rubble of war in Tolkien's cue came from . 
the fact that he, and with his J)O.Wers of 
observation, drew many scenes and 
vignettes for his later works-the wreak and 
destruction of baUle scenes, the knowledge 
and abWty to apply on paper the "long hours 
of marching at nighttime-the utter con-
fusion." Most importantly, Tollden drew 
characters and their "attitudes" for his 
writings. . 
. "Mr. $am Gamgee (F'rodo's faithful 

servant in ne Lord of tile RIap) II iDdeed a 
reflection of the Engllsb soldier," he ad-
mitted to one interviewer. As reported in 
Grotta-Kruska's book ArclIitect of MIddle 
Earth. Tolkien "admired the si.nple 
working-class and rustic lads who bad 
volunteered for the' anny as soon as the war 
had been declared; they were not brave or 
heroic, and did not want to die, but they saw 
their duty and did it." Uke hobbits. 

Though Tolkien detested allegories, 
constantly stating thjIt The Lerd of the 
Rings was an allegory of- "no sorts," be 
nonetheless admitted, "An author cannot of 
course remain wholly unaffeclted by his 
experiences." In Tolkien's case, there were, 
naturally, some pronounced ekperiences, as 
well as some lesser ones. In early life he was 
stung by a tarantula, causing a Iife-long fear 
of spiders. This phobia was displayed in The 
Hobbit. 'I1Je Lord of the RIDgI and The 
SIlmarilUGa. 

Tolkien's devout catholicism dictated his 
"Olristian" outlook 10 writings. Some 
critics have questioned the absence of a God 
in Middle Earth, but The SUmarllllOD makes 
evident the Eru, "the One," is God. Tollden 
on different occasions either admitted or left 

·a tacit silence over such things as the 
waybread (lembas) of the elves being 
equivalent to the eucharist and Lady 
Galadriel being the portrait of the Virgin 
Mary. The Yalars of The Sllmarillloa were 
indeed angels and Tolkien admitted in one 
interview, ''Gandalf Is an angel." 

Tolkien was of the mind that "Natural 
Order implies Ouistian Order," but 
nonetheless made Middle-Earth a pre-
ClIristian world without OrigInal Sin and 
therefore without a need for OIrilt. The case 
has been made that Tolkien Introduced 
Frodo as a Ouist-ftgure, and indeed he Is 

seen in many Otrist-Uke images; but Frodo 
can also be aeen as a representative at man 
(In the form of a hobbit) and the ability In 
our race to have the good overcome the bad. 

Tolkien W81 a lecturer at Leeds until 1924, 
when, at the age of 32, ·he was appointed 
Professor at the school. Tolkien's unspoken 
desire to return to Oxford was granted the 
following year when he was offered a post at 
Bosworth and Rawlinson as Professor of 
Anglo-Saxon. 

Life at Oxford was to Tolkien's liking. He 
was a popular professor, instilling his love 
and mastery of pbilology and early English 
literature into the curriculum. The only 
thing students (and ultimately reporters) 
disliked about Tolkien was his annoying lack 
of enunciation. As Grotta-Kurska noted, " he 
spoke in a low pitched, solt"'lpoken, rapid 
voice, not bothering to enunciate or ar-
ticulate clearly. Tolklen mumbled con-
stantly, his speech often seemed garbled to 
even his most attentive listeners, and he 
unconsciously upset friends because they 
could never teU whether he was telling a 
joke or cursing under his breath." 

In some ways Tolkien was the 
stereotypical Oxford don. He cared little 
about social movements ; the sights of 

'I1Ie snm.rnuoil dealt with the first and 
second kingdoms of Middle Earth, and as 
such a certain group, that which modern 
myths are made of, was never included. 
Hobbits. 

A passage from1be Arcbitect of Middle 
Eartb tells of the "discovery" of hobbits. 
" In the summer of 1928, while marking an 
especially boring lot of exa~tion papers, 
Tolkten came across one with a black page 
on it-which is possibly the best thing that can 
happen to an examiner-and wrote in it , 'In a 
hole in the ground lived a hobbit." 'Tolkien 

'said, Names always generate a story in my 
mind and eventually I thought I should find 
out what hobbits were like. But that was 
only the beginning.I spew the elements out of 
my hea~; I didn't do any organizing at all' ." 

As for where the word "hobbit" comes 
from, Tolkien could never be sure. He did 
note, however , that Sinclair Lewis' Babblt 
"has the same bourgeois smugness that 
hobbits do . His world is the same limited 
place." . 

Tolkien thought of his work as a " half-
finished manuscript to amuse the children" 
(he was in the habit of reading it to his three 
boys) . Indeed, he was constantly of the mind 
that he should "get back to my serious work-

terviewer, "I am in fact (l h;;t;blt in aU but 
size. I like gird ens , trees, unmechanlzed 
farm lands, I smoke a pi,e and like good 
plain food .. .I'm fond 01 mu'lhrooms out of a 
field, have a very simple sense of humor. I 
go to bed late and get up late, when 
possible . " 

In 1938 Tolkien began 1be lArd of the 
lUngs, but was not to finish until 1949. He 
claimed his writing the work was an attempt 
to modernize old myths and make them 
apropos in our age . A conversation with C.S. 
Lewis (well known author and critic) ex-
plains a part of this overall Tolkien 
philosophy. "We came from God; and 
inevitably the myths woven by us, though 
they contain error, would also reflect a 
splintered fragment of true light, the eternal 
truth which is God." 

Feedback over his work came through the 
"Oxford Oiristians" (the label given to 
Tolkien, Lewis and Oiarles Williams for 
their confessed religious ways and beliefs ) 
and another larger group of Oxford 
professors called " The Inklings." Tolkien's 
readings were referred to by Lewis as "The 
New Hobbit." 

Tolkien was very serious about The lArd 
of tbe lUngs. It was not a " children 's yam" 
as was, in his opinion, The Hobbit. The 
lUIusual thing, though, was that Tolkien had 
no idea of what was to happen in the story 
except that the ring had to be destroyed in 
the end. As the story progressed Tolkien 
welded Middle Earth together, drawing 
upon his encyclopediac knowledge of The 
SIlmarIllJOD. When finally finished with The 
lArd of the Rings, Tolkien said, "It is 
written in my lifeblood sllch as that is, thick 
or thin, and I can do no other. " 

Utilizing all sorts of mythologies, Tolkien 
made a world of the third age of Middle 
Earth. According to Tolkien, the main 
theme of his epic is the inevitability of 
death. Throughout the book Tolkien utilizes 
eucatastrophies (a word of Tolkien's own-it 
means good will which overcomes evil). The 
most satisfying euchatastrophies was the 
denial of death. 

Tolklen from The 
Hobbilio The 
Sllmarllllon 

Tolkien, the master philologist, drew in 
the readers through ' 'vocal realism." Ruth 
&. Noel in her book The Mytbology 01 Middle 
Earth, explained how he did this: "Tollden 
consistently suggested the natures of the 
various peoples of Middle Earth through the 
sounds of their language (no less than fif-
teen different languages appear in Tolkien's 
works, excluding Modem and Middle 
English) . The musical flow of Elvisb words 
and names implies that the Elves were a 
noble people with a love of beauty and 
music . The guttural, unfamiliar sounds of 
Dwarvish indicates how completely that 
language was isolated from men and elves. 
The prolonged woodwind chants of the Ents 
demonstrates their unhurried1ife as part of 
the forest . The croaked curses of the Orcs 
establish them as a coarse, cruel, 
unimaginative folk." 

Submitted to Allen and Unwin in 1950, The 
lord of tbe RiDgs was rejected by an em-
ployee unfamiliar with the work or author. 
Tolkien was deeply hurt and hwniliated. It 
was some time before be could be convinced 
to sutmit the work again. Accepted by Allen 

and~ UnWin, it was done so with the ex-
pectation of losing a thousand pounds. This 
was done because Raynor Unwin declared it 
"a work of genius," and so received a wire 
from his fathe~ reading, " If you think it a 
work of genius then you may lose a thousand 

I 
"traditional events and "festyles" 
deteriorating only seeming to depress him. 
He was said to be an old-fashioned con-
servative, thinking each man bad his class. 
Stories affirm, however, that there was no 
"social conceit" about him. The man was 
considered very humble, though in later life 
he maintained an obvious pride over bi.'J 
works. 

Believing that the only truth was found in 
literature, he seldom persued the 
newspaper and was often unaware of 
current events. His garb was very plain and 
very masculine, appearance never being a 
concern of his . His demeanor was usually 
steady, although he was known to go from 
black gloom to high humor and vice-versa in 
a matter of moments. 

As a writer, Tolkien's work habits could at 
best be described as "disorganized.' f 
Though he would 'write' for several hours a 
day in the garage, he was a procrastinator 
of the worst sort, creating his own 
distractions, drawing little figures, creating 
doodles with a flourish, working on the 
E1visb language, or else assuming a time-
consuming calligraphy in his writing style. 

In 1916 Tolkien began The SUmariDioa, 
but, as was his habit; he worked slowly. 
Tolkien's pride was hurt in the 1920s when 
The SlImarlllloD was rejected by a 
publishing firm. Fate works in many ways; 
Tolklen's rejection probably benefitted him.

The reviews of the book were excellent on but gradually word of this "unusual" book

"Welcome to LA": East views west 

n's not surprising that Welcome to LA bas been 
better received by reviewers on the East Coast than 
on the West Coast. The film is bound to be popular 
witb Easterners because it fits their conception of 
what Californians are like: rootless, shallow, 
plastic. 

The characters are the sort of people you might 
expect to meet at a kind of cocktail pary in a 
Southern California beachfront condominium. 
Carroll Barber (Keith Carradine) is a songwriter 
who has returned to Los 'Mgeles after a two-year 
hiatus in England to collaborate on an albwn with 
another singer. Barber spends most of his time 
playing pool and having sex with a variety of 
women , including his father 'S girlfriend Nona 
(Lauren Hutton), his father 's secretary, the wife of 
his father 'S partner, Karen (Geraldine Chaplin ) and 
his real estate agent , Ann Goode (Sally Kellennan ). 

Ken Hood (Harvey Keitel ) is a relentlessly am-
bitious executive who "works too hard ," as he puts 
it , but still finds time for extramarital dalliances 
with Linda (Barber 's housekeeper, played by Sissy 
Spacek ) and Ann. 

Karen is an urban wolf who rides around in taxis 
spouting pop philosophy , Linda, Barber's blithe 
housekeeper , moonlights as a whore , picking up 
Ken , and Ann Goode's husband. The action of the 
fi lm consists of a series of loosely strung vignettes 
based on the relat ionships of the group of charac-
ters . 

Like the people you meet at such cocktail parties , 
the characters seem no more than -a series of 
mannerisms. They toss off lines that soWld patently 
phony even when they are meant to be sincere . Ann 
Goode sighs : " Everything sounds like a lie these 
days." Karen Hood says solemnly: " I always write 
down the names of streets and the numbers of the 
taxis 1 take ," and "The sleep of reason produces 
monsters; Goya said that. " 

And wbat tlappens to these rootless, dissatisfied 
people? According to Welcome to LA, they don't 
change, but just drift along, tiding themselves over 
with sex , liquor and work. Even Karen and Ken, 
who agree, in one of the film's best scenes, to 
retreat to the country and take up farming, can't 
break their habit of insincerity. Ken, who 'is 
genuinely moved as he tells his wife he wiD give up 
his job and his other women, can 't resist feeding 
Karen a line about how " our relationship can go 
beyond the typical quote-unquote male-female 
relationship." We know it is a line because we have 
heard him say the same thing to his mistress. In a 
sense it says something about all the characters: 
the ir insincerity is so ingrained ill them that they 
can 't break away from it even when they want to. 

The film 's cliche-ridden conception of what 
Californians are like is often amusing , but in the 
end, not very convincing, because the film doesn't 
go beyond its cliches . We know the c~aracters only 
by their habits : Nona by ber motor~rive Nikon, 
Barber his Southern Comfort, Karen by her taxi and 
notebook, Linda by her topless housekeeping. This 
is not the fault of ' the actors , forthe caM is an im-
pressive one, but rather of the limited space the 
script gives them to work in. At best the cbaracters 
become curiosities like Chaplin 's Karen, or 
Spacek's Linda , but even they don't engage the 
'viewer 's interest or sympathy. 

Welcome to LA shares many surface similarities 
. with Robert Altman's "Nashville ." (It is important 
to note that while Altman produced Welcome to LA 
the director was Alan Rudolph, an Altman protege. ) 
Both films focus on locales, both take the fonn of a 
series of vignettes . But where the vignettes of 
"Nashville" involved stronger characters and a 
central focus , Welcome to LA seems as aimless and 
lackadaisical as the characters themselves.

Champs cope with modern life 
It would be a mistake to think 

1\at Cham' ......... Be...,a merely 
compares the game of basketball 
and the vocation of Ofe. Rather, 
Jason MIller's play is mucb more 
complex, as It deals with the way 
five midcDe aged men who were at , 
one time members of a close-knit 
high sc:booI basketball team cope 
with the pressures rl modem-day 
life. 

The five cbaracters in the piay -
four ex-basketbaU players and 
their old high school Coacb - were 
part of a team wblcb won the state 
championship in 1162, Every yur 
since tben they have gathered 
together at the coacb's bouse to 
relive past glories. 

The imelaction between the 
characters on the twentieth an-
niversary of that championship 
season makes for a very 
provocative play whicb is now 
running at the Carter Center stage 
in Balboa Park. 

As the play progresses it is ap-
parent that the passage of time has 
not been kind to the old players. 
One, George, has become Mayor of 
the town, but faces a tough re-
election battle against a smart 
opponent . Another, Phil, is a very 
successfUl businessman who has 
problems with local en-
vironmentalists. A third, James, is 
a junior high school principal who 
feels he is in a dead~nd position. A 
fou rth , Tom , is a hopeless 
alcoholic. 

And the Coach, the magnetic and 
powerful man who led them to 
victory , was fired from his job 
after punching a student who 
caUed him an obscene name. 

All the characters feel rejected 
by the society which twenty years 
before lauded them as champions. 
As their evening of drinking and 
reminiscing progresses it becomes 
obvious they all seek a return to the 
security of that time. They en-
dlessly recaU the championship 
game, its various nuances and 
plays. They defer decisions to the 

Theatre 
Coach, just as they bad before. And 
the Coach tries desperately to keep 
his old group together. 

"You need each other," he tells 
them. " You can't go it alone these 
days. Those days are over." 

But modern life has brought 
pressure which threatens to tear 
the old team apart. Phil, for in-
stance, doesn't want to conunit all 
.his political contributions to 
George, whom he expects to lose 
the mayoral election. Phil would 
rather try to be " progressive, II and 
contribute to both candidates, as a 
matter of political expediency. The 
Coach, though, sees such a course 
as a contradiction to old team 
loyalties. 

For the most part, the in-
teraction between characters 
works weD. But, occasionaDy, 
author MiUer's characterizations 
are brutally unsympathetic to 
these men who face cultural shock. 
The old players often appear as 

Movies: Paul Watry 

nothing more than drunken , racist 
and seH~ntered rednecks. 

Another flaw in the play stems 
from the ract that it takes place on 
a drinking evening. There is a 
natural tendency for an actor to 
overplay his role when his 
character is drunk; the actors in 
this prodUction occasionally fall 
prey to this problem. 

But, on the whole, the production 
is well done, and the credit belongs 
to the actors , who have difficult 
roles . 

The entire evening's action 
revolves around the Coach. He has 
been the center of t he other 
characters' lives for twenty years; 
they listen to him, depend on him 
for advice and follow his orders. 
Sheldon Gero carries the role off 
well , without playing it too 
broadly, which he could easily 
have done. 

The best role, however , belongs

PARADIGM LOST ... · 
Even the utoPian 

philosopbers tbese roCkers 
reputedly took their cues from, 
(rem the Fabian aoctalists, to 
the Hog Farm and even Man. 
pondered theM questions at 
some length, though none of 
tbem came to anytbing 
resembling a theoretical 
resolution. Marx saved hhnself 
frcm ultimate debunking by 
refusing finaHty, by refusing to 
postulate that the ills of the 
world can be solved by good 
vibes and good intentions. 
Rather, he laid down some 
ground rules for revolution that 
latter day Marxists are still 
trying to COOle to grips with. 

. 'Ibis isn't about the social 
order that late sixties 
progressive rock was 
forecasting, but rather about 
the dumb thinking and false 
moves that are spawned from a 
music that suddenly became 
"art" by the say-so of 
professional media intellectuals 

• like Ralph Gleason, Nat Hentoff 
and Albert Goldman. 

These scribes, writing in 
Time, Newsweek and RoIllDg 
StOlle about the new music to a 
mass audience, got con-
siderable mileage out of the 
subject. They likened the long 
jams by Qum to the free jazz 
of Ornette Coleman and -Albert 
Ayler, called Frank Zappa a 
latter day classical genius and 
the best comic wit since l.8lny 
Pruce, and dwelled on the lyrics 
of Paul Simon, Dylan, and Joni 
Mitchell in terms that smacked 
of academia with constant 
allusions to Ellot, Pond, Gin-
sberg and other deceased or 
has-been ootables. 

'Ibis "Art By Association" 
made for fine reading, but it had 
an adverse effect on the 

songwrIterII. The young rockers 
were sllddenly tbrust into 
Heavy Company. IUId bad to 
produce works that carried on 
the traditioo of Great Art. The 
lyrics became ponderous and 
murky with balf~ormed ide .. 
that came om of a psychedelic 
deliri 1lDl; the music wal 
saturated with pointless elec-
tronic effects and incidental 
paraphenaUa from exotic 
sources (remember the sitar 
craze?); and most of the stUff 
today seems Juvenile. 

Rock, as far as I was con-
cerned, already came from a 
great tradition, like Elvis, 
QUICk Berry, Muddy Waters 
and Hank WUliams. The music 
was the fusing of different 
ethnic sounds jelled into a form 
that was bi-cultural. Rackers in 
the late siities became repulsed 
by their rustlc associations, and 
dressed in the artifice of in-
tellectual endeavor. They 
distrusted their own roots, cast 
them aside, and in the process 
denatured the vitality of rock. 

Not all the stuff from the 
sixties was bad, however. SIt. 
Pepper and releases by Hen-
drix, Jeff Beck, The Stones, 
SPirit, the Airplane and others 
are listenable today because of 
good songs and inspired per-
fonnances . But these were 
artists who ignored the trends 
and trusted their own resour-
ces. Even if there were alien 
elements of jazz, classical 
music or electronics traceable 
in their work, they maintained a 
sense of humor and craft-
smanship which never allowed 
trends. gimmicks and tbe 
Impulse to be meaningful 
override their intentions. Also, 
they probably never read their 
own reviews.
