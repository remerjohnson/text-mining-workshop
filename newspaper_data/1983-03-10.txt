OPEC, oil, and our future 
By KEVIN WALSH 

The collapse of the BreLLon 
Woods system and its fixed 
exchange rates paved the way 
for the Organization of 
Petroleum Exportmg Coun-
tri s (OPEC) to raise oil price~ 
dramatically in 197:3. At thi~ 
point the world economy 
entered a phase f)f extraordi-
nary instablity. In the absence 
of firm exchange rates, 
governments afforded them-
selves high budget deficits, 
which were financed through 
an expansionary monetary 
policy. A huge Eurodollar 
market was created wit h the 
surplus oil dollars inve~ted at 
short ·term rate~, allowing the 
accumulation of unpreced n· 
tcd International debts. Thus, 
the Industrialized countries 
experienced only a small part 
of the increase in oil pri e,;. 
The rea l burden fell on the 
developing countr ies, whose 
term of trade great l y 
dete r iora t e d . Now. t h e 
commercia l ba nk of the 
ind ustrialized cou ntrie are 
threatened by high interna· 
tiona l indebtedness and 
insolvency. 

The second oi l price shock of 
1979-80 cou ld not bedealt with 
in the same way. After a 
decade of g lobal inflation, the 
world is in a deep economic 
rece. sion, the wor ,t since the 
1930". The oil price increase of 
197980 is the main cause of 
thIs. 

The present (Jil glut is 
rai~ing hopes that balance of 
pay ments problems will ease. 
consumer pnces and inflation 
vvill drop. and that the 
purchasing power released 
will spark new growth. The 
prospect of falling oil prices is 
a sign of hope for some 
count ries, bu t a cause of 
concern to others. At last. oil 
producing nations inside and 

outside of OPEC are realizing 
that their prosperity depends 
on other countries. Many 
problems and questions face 
the world in the coming year~: 
the stabilit y of the countries of 
the Middle East. So\iet 
behavior in this area. and the 
importance of maintaining 
adequate level ' of investment 
in alternative energ)- sources. 
What is absolutely clear is that 
secure energy supplies are the 
key to growt h. 

For the past several weeks. 
representati\,es of OPEC have 
been meeting almo~t daily in 
order to establish acceptable 
oil pnces and levels of produc-
tion to be allowed by each 
OPEC member. The follo\'v'ing 
interVIew WIt h Professor Peter 
Cowher was cond ucted on 
March 3rd for the Guardian by 
Kevin Walsh. Professor 
Cowhey has been a member of 
UCSD's Department of 
Pol itical Science since 1976. 
He is the a uthor of The 
Problem 0/ Plenty: Energy 
Policy and I nternational 
Politics (UC Pres 1982) and co-
editor of Pro/it and the Pursuit 
0/ Energy: World Energy 
Markets and Government 
Regulation in the Next Decade 
(We. tview Press 1982). Mr. 
Walsh is also the Editor in 
Chief of Politjoumal. Uc. D's 
undergraduate journal of the 
social sciences. 
G u a rd ian: In 1979· 1980. 
Iran and Iraq curtailed 
production of oil. resulting in a 
temporar) shortage of 
supplies and allowing OPEC to 
raise prices to $3~ p b. This 
created a !,TJ'eat incentive to 
increase prod uct ion. especially 
by producers outside of OPEC. 
Presently. there is an 
increased supply and a 
reduced demand. OPEC's 
market share has decreased by 
one·third to less than h"lf of

Plan before its final approval 

The Ides of March 
By JOHN BRICE 

There is something going on 
next Tuesday, and I don't 
mean the adistic exercise 
known as finals week . No, 
there is something even icker 
taking place - a political 
election. Well,l guess elections 
are all political. This one may 
be the most important mayoral 
election t ha t has graced 
America's Finest City. The 
Ides of March has never been 
known as a great day for the 
politicos but March IS, 1983. 
will most likely produce two 
winners here in sunshine city. 

For the first time since 1971 
the pow\~ r in City Hall will not 
be controlled by Pete Wilson. 
who guided the growth of 
America's eighth larges t city 
from a s tring o f beac h 
communities into a world 
leader in high technology 
industrie and in the fi eld of 
re earc h and developme nt. 
Mayor Pete i now Senator 
Pete, having given up his 
K e arn y Me s a c ondo in 
exc hange for lobbyi s t in 
Georgetown. Meanwhile the 
fight for control of empire is on 
the line. 

So what , you might be 
thinking. Well, if you are part 
of the UCSD crew that looks 
on San Diego as jus t a part of 
UCSD. then I guess that it 
does not make a difference. 
But if you make this place 
home 12 months of the year 
you might be concerned with 
ju s t who is signing the 
building permits. If thi s is the 
ca se then you might want to 
stumble out of your bed and do 
yo ur c i v ic dut y before 
becoming engrossed in your 
declining GPA . Call EDNA a nd 
ask them where to vote if you 
live on campu s . I tri ed bu t t he 
EDNA line wa~ busy. If you 
live off ca m pus t hen I guess 
that you a lso votc off cam pus 
bu t do n't q uote me on th aI. 

You wi ll ha\'e 20 candidates 
to pick fro m. ~o bring a dart or 
"lomet h ing th at wi ll a id you in 
an analv t ica l se lect ion 
process. [f'}-ou don't likeanyof

·' P.M." would have done well. 
Political scientis t s note a 
relationship between political 
success and appearing on a 
television screen. 

There is a real smorgasbord 
of hopefuls to choose from . 
The top line of the ballot offers 
a potter and a musician . 
Perhaps we can turn San 
Onofre into a kiln and generate 
our energy from jazz fusion. 
The lineup also includes a 
college student/reformer, but 
watch out; he is a pre-med and 
claims to be as "intelli~ent as 
any of the candidates.' There 
is also a singles group leader. I 
am not sure. but he may have 
s omething t o do with 
matc hing a c ert a in good 
Catholic girl with a millionaire 
hu s band who is twice her age 
and has been married five 
times more than most of us. 
There is only one unemployed 
police officer and he is not on 
the Peace and Freedom ticket 
yet. For you radical types there 
is a working class activ ist. 
Finally there is a woman who 
goes by the name Rosalyn and 
claims to be the trainer of great 
mayor. I don't think she ever 
worked in San Franci sco or 
Chicago. Bu t I think that you 
s hould be leery of someone 
without a last name. 

In a town where the political 
concerns rarel y meander 
beyond selecting captains for 
the pickup volleyball, games, 
thi s election is stirring up 
quite a bit of interes t. While 
th e rain has s tolen the s how 
and you may think that the 
candidates are all wet, one of 
the leading fou r: Bill Cleator. 
Ma u reen O'Connor , Roger 
Hedgecock o r Bill Mitchell will 
lead thi s ci t y. Into what 
remain s to be seen but unl ess

seaboa rd may be dwa rfed b y a

year. 

Based on the findings of the 
res ident members of the 
Univer s ity Community 
Planning Group (UCPG ) in 
their review of the draft plan, 
the UCCC Executive Board 
opposes the draft plan for the 
following reasons. The draft 
plan significantly deviates 
from the previously adopted 
plan which emphasized 
residential development 
supporting faculty, staff, and 
student body of UCSD. The 
draft plan emphasizes the 
development of regional 
commercial and visitor 
facilities that would cause a 
major shift from other already 

'Housing needs of the UCSD 
community and senior citizens 
are not met by the draft plan , 
and the needs of local residents 
will be sacrificed in favor of 
regional development and 
business interests. Further-
more. the 1980 Traffic Study. 
upon which the draft plan is 
based, greatly underestimates 
the traffic projections for the 
area. The UCCC Executive 
Board requests that the traffic 
s tudy be completel y redone 
before a final draft of thi s plan 

We ask your s upport in our 
oppos ition to the draft of the 
University Community Plan 
in the form of leters to, and 
personal ppearances before, 
the Planning Commission 
(next hearing scheduled for 
March 10, 1983) and the City 
Counc il (not yet on their 
docket) . If you would like more 
information about thi s draft 
plan and the UCCC pos ition,

Chairper on, Margo Rebar at

Northern Ireland, and the

The headline for Mike 
Greenberg's interview reads, 
"Ireland Under Wraps. " This 
implies that the Britis h are 
occupying Ireland . The 
headline should have read. 
"Northern Ircland Under 
Wraps. " There mus t be a 
distinction made between 
Ireland and Northern Ireland. 
The Britis h were In Ireland for 
400 y ear s . Th e Iri s h 
Republican Army wa s formed 
to rid the::32 counties of Ireland 
of Britis h rule. After the Iris h 
Republican Arm y's defea t in

Tragedy in Ireland: Overview 
continued from palle 2 
elections to stay Rritish. The 
minority of Roman Catholics 
are free to cross the border into 
the Republic of Ireland. 

Why does the majority in 
Ulster demand to be British? 
The majorit y of Nort hern 
Ireland citizens belong lO the 
Anglican (E nglish ) church. 
Also, the economy of Nort hern 
rreland is stronger than that of 
the Republic. Northern Irela nd 
ha s great industries such as 
ShilrbUildll1g, and North Sea 
Oil to provide jobs. 

The ll1ajorit y 111 ;-,/ort llL'rn 
Ireland demanded the State of 
Emergency whICh now e"lsh 
in responSl' to Ihe terronst 
allacb in Northern Ireland. 
The Emergency Act suspends 
certain rights of civilians, and 
allows a sort of Martial La\\·. It 
takes only :WO terrorists from 
such groups as t he provisional 
wing of the fRA , and the Irish 
National Liberation Arm\" to 
require a securit) force of 
20.000 British (E ngl ish. 
Scottis h , and Welsh ) troops in 
Northern Ireland.

Giving people a sinecure in

had heard of the job does not 
create a staff which knows 
how to teach English or evcn 
one which knows English at

Without question, the

Tijuana. This might be a bit 
premature but like Mr. 
lledgecock ... a "s, "t he rest of

So. 'if th iS a ll "e(,llls

Deputy Mayor Btll Cleator. 
is in fact , only deputy mayor at 
this time bv chance. and I 
guess a bIt -of luck . It is a 
rotating pos ition and it just 
happened to land on his de"k at 
t he same time he is running for 
mayor. Progressi ve· thlnking 
Cleat o r wants t o build 
apartment s inside industrial 
parks. 

Roger "rock and roll" 
lI edgecock rea lly did enter the 
real estate busi'ness when he 
was in his teen .... He bought a 
home in Ocean Beach but I 
don't know hO\\ close to the 
pier It IS or if he owned a 
motorcycle at I he time. Oh yes. 
Mr . Hedgecock point s out that 
he wa" city attorney, but I 

guess he forgot to teHus that It 
\\'a:-. th e cit v of Del Mar. Oh 
\\ hat th!' hell. 

Bill MItchell was reported to

O'Connor will get more 
votes than an\,one and face 
Roger Hedgecock in the May

progressive thinkers and 
O'Connor ever offered me 
something to eat. I can't be

badly queezed in their long· 
term objectives and they 
would be producing 7 to 8.5 
million bpd . That i not the 
option we ha ve. and 
underneath tho e c ircum · 
tance . the market shares are 

wrong. To give you some sense 
of that, in Mayor July of 1982, 
Saudi Arabia was producing 
about 6.2 million bpd. a 
opposed to 2.2 million bpd In 
Iran . In other words . about 
triple. In December. it had 
shrunk to a bout 5.6 versus 2.8. 

till more than double. Under 
the propo ed production 
quotas that are being kicked 
around today. the Saudis 
would produce maybe about 
4.5 million bpd and the 
Iranians about 2.5 mill ion bpd. 
G: Are you referring to the 
proposed production quotas as 
the amounts each country can 
produce according to collective 
decision and agreement by the 
members of OPEC ? 
PC: Yes. that i correct. 

capacity to produce about 11.5 
million bpd . They 're produc-
ing actually alxlUt half of that. 
The on ly countries th a t , if you 
got intoanall -out pricewar(by 
all-out price war r mean if the 
price of oi l dropped to $22 pb). 
the only countries that could 
survive in terms of trying to 
keep a high level of revenues, 
close to their current level by 
cutting price and dramati · 
cally raising sales, are Saudi 
Arabia, Kuwait . the United 
Arab Emirate . and Nigeria. 
T here are others.who can do it

some flexibilit y. Th e 
igerians are crit ical beca use 

they are the one country that 
is really pressed for cas h that 
has a large surplu s capacity 
that could be mobilized in a 
price war. Therefore, I think 
the fir st priority of the inner 
cadre of Arab countries is to 
quiet the Nigerians down . 
That is the basic s hort ·term 
economic solution . although 
there are some complexities I

let t he Saudis make their 
adjustments to a com promise 
that they think will be 
amenable to Iran . But no one 
really knows whether or not 
Iran will rea ll y bu y the 
compromise. 
G: Clearly, the s trength of 
OPEC depends on keeping the 
ranks together. A breakdown 
has occured WI th Nigeria 

G: RepresentatiH's of OPEC 
ha ve been meeting e\'er~ day 
for t he past se\'eral weeks. 
Iran . however. IS not laking 
part in the~e talk" by its 0\\ n 
choice. Can you explain why 
the Iranians do nol want to 
ta ke part in these talks when il 
is Ob\IOUsly 111 theIr interests? 

decreasi ng its price to $30 pb 
a ft er Britain, a non·OPEC 
cou ntry. lowered the price of 
its N. Sea crude. Nigeria has 
severe domesLIc problems, is 
$3 to 5 bi ll ion in arrears, It has 
a $3 B trade related debt. $12 B 
non·trade debt. and this 
situation is aggra\'ated by the 
terms of its membership in 
OPEC . Why has OPEC not 
cha nged Nlgeria's market

differential when il appeared 
~ imminent that Nigeria would

gravlly, and transportatIOn 
costs. The African stales of 
Algeria , Libya, and igeria 
have relati vely low su lfer, 
light oil with good transpor' 
tation cos ts, At all times they 
should sell for a higher price 
than Saudi Arabia because of 
the differences in transpor-
tation costs and because of the 
differences inquality. Thereis 
no way t he market can 
function in a rational way 
wi thout these differences. 
Likewise. the Nigerians have 
to watch for N. SeaOlI because 
it IS right next door to the 
European markers. So you 
ha\'e a very complex change. 
The Nigerians. the~. along 
\\Ith Algeria and Lib~ a. are 
among the hard core In OPEC 
that insi,ted on running up 
prices during t he period from 
I!J79 to 1981 becausl' theIr oil

they forccd SaudI ArabIa lip to 
$3-1 pb the problem the~ had '" 
once dcmand started to go

lut to dn·. For SaudI ArabIa to 
change t'he ("fferentIaI would 
require - once demand 
started to go down - \\'ould 
mean SaudI Arabia would 
have to cut its price. which it 
wasn't will ing to do. It was 
willing to cut its production, 
whIch it did do. 

PC: I have a theory that i ' 
based primari ly on the market 
charactenstics right now. plus 
a secondary politica l 
strategem. You look at two 
numbers: the currenl le\'els of 
production that are expected 
o\'er the year versu~ the actual 
total capacity to produce. The 

audis, for example, have the 

Rxfor

to varying degrees, but those 
are the countries that could 
clearly do it. Those countries, 
in three of the four ca~es, 

audi Arabia . Kuwail, and the 
United Arab Emirates, share 
properties of relalI\'Cly sma ll 
population, allowlOg them 

Iranians. the best way to put 
pressure on the Saudis i . to sit 
back and say nothing. The 
Saudis know that if they go 
into a price war. escalating 
production as part of the price 
war, that the risks of some

UCSD professor will 
direct SD Symphony 

Bernard Rands, professor of 
music at UCSD, wiII be the guest 
conductor of the San Diego 
Symphony Orchestra on March 
24, 25 and 27 at the Civic 
Theatre. 

Rands will direct the 
symphony in "Madrigali," his 
own composition which was 
commissioned by the National 
Symphony Orchestra of 
Washington, DC. "Madrigali " is 
an orchestral work based on 
Monteverdi's "Eighth Book of 
Madrigals," It ws first performed 
in Kennedy Center in May 1977. 

Rands has recently received 
several honors. He has been 
chosen by the American 
Academy and Institute of Arts 
and Letters to receive an award 
" in recognition of his creative 
work in music," to be presented 
at its annual ceremony in New 
York in May, 

In January, Rands was given a 
fellowship from the National 
Endowment for the Arts, the 
highest amount ever awarded to 
an individual for music 
composition. He currently has a 
fellowship from the Guggen-
heim foundation to compose a 
work he is titling "Canti del 

Sole." He has also received a 
commission for the BBC to write 
a new work for chorus and 
orchestra , which will be 
presented in 1984 in Europe 
during "Euroyear." 

Last summer Rands and John 
Cage were the only two 
composers from the United 
States invited to participate in 
"Music Today, " a festival of 
contemporary music held in 
Tokyo. 

Rands was born in Sheffield, 
England. He received his 
Bachelor of Music and Master of 
Music degrees from the 
University of Wales, and later 
studied with Daliapiccola, 
Berio, Boulez and Maderna. His 
compositions have been 
performed at most of the 
world 's major music festivals. 
including Venice, Warsaw, Paris, 
Darmstadt. Aspen, Prague and 
the IRCAM Institute in Paris. 

The San Diego Symphony 
performances featuring Rands 
as guest conductor are 
scheduled for 7 pm on Thursdav.

New Penguin schedule 

Incorporated in 1968 as a 
non-profit, private program, Up 
With People has two functions : 
to build bridges of under-
standing and communication 
among peoples, cultures, and 
countries: and to give young 
people a learning experience 
that also matures the person, 

Each member of the cast is 
also a student. During the 11 
months each performer spends 
on the road, he or she travels an 
average of 35,000 miles, or 
56,000 kilometers, learning 
first hand about the diverse 
cultures and customs of the 
world. The Up With People

Beginning with " The Path," a 
piece more along the lines of 
classical ballet, Jazz Unlimited 's 
concert included a wide variety 
of works ranging from " Lead 
Boots," a western, to "Burn 
Rubber," a cool enactment of 
night street life, to . Jukebox," a 
1920s selection which included 
a lovely duet by Kristin Kuerbis 
and Scott Benson. 

Twins Pal and Alice Rincon

than adorable as they pushed 
each other around in a shopping

Mdrth 10. 198;\ IIIdlU .3 



In an Interesting bit of 
program reshuffling a few weeks 
back, CB5-lV moved its Monday 
night series Square Pegs to 
Saturday night. 

What made this one night 
stand so intriguing wasn't so 
much the network's reasoning 
behind the switch - ego to 
remove a ratings-soft show from 
the destructive path of The 
Winds of War - but that it put 
Square Pegs on at a time when 
its central charcters would most 
likely be home watChing 
television. 

Trying to salvage the great TV 
wasteland with ,~,quare Pegs' 

Square Pegs is a half-hour 
sitcom revolving around two 
teenage girls. Lauren 
Hutchinson and Patty Greene 
(Amy linker and Sarah Jessica 
Parker), freshmen at Weemawee 
High School in suburban New 
York. Lauren, who is chubby and 
wears braces, and Patty, tall and 
skinny and self-consciously shy 
about her glasses ("She'd be 
perfect if she weren't legally 
blind" is how a substitute 
teacher played by guest star Bill 
Murray described her), are 
social outcasts - "square 
pegs" - at Weemawee, so each 
week Lauren cooks up a new 
schemo! to put them, in her 
words, "on the express train to 
popularity." 

The show has its faults, but 
Squar'! Pegs is the freshest -

not to mention the hippest -
series on prime-time television. 
It pushes too hard too often for 
the easy laugh, but frequently it 
hits close to home. ,t may not 
be, to use the inimitable Johnny 
Slash's catchphrase, " totally 
different head, " but it's unique 
enough to merit repeated 
watching. (Local CBS affiliate 
Channel 8 hasn't been 100 
helpful in this regard, until 
recently scheduling its public 
afairs programming in the same 
Monday 8 pm timeslot : 
however, with the overdue 
demise of Private Benjamin, 
the problem seems to have been 
remedied.) 

Square Pegs is the brainchild 
of Ann Beatts, formerly a writer 
for Saturday Night Live and 
National Lampoon. Based on 
her own experiences - '" was 
the class nothing, the class 
freak," she says - Squre Pegs 
brings to mind the Lampoon 's 
high school yearbook parody, a 
hilarious volume which also 
managed to pack a fair amount 
of pathos.

By P11 Kt:L TOOI'IBS 
Patty face formidable obstacles 
in their path to popularity. To 
begin with, Beatts has supplied 
Square Pegs with a couple of 
eternally popular teen types: 
Mulfy (Jami Gertz) is Miss 
School Spirit. that obnoxiously 
straightlaced student who 's, as 
Lauren put it. "drunk on pep;" 
and Vinnie (Jon Caliri) is the 

.1 

Johf'l{\"j 
S\t),S~ ,\ 

archetypal hood , " John 
Travolta, Sylvester Stallone and 
the fonz all rolled into one," 
whose brains must all be in his 
leather jacket. 

Also aligned on the popular 
side are Vinnie 's awesomely 
modern girlfriend Jenn ifer 
(Tracy Nelson, daughter of 

always-in-demand '50s teen 
throb Ricky Nelson), who can ·t 
finish a sentence without using 
the word "like" at least once 
(her motto: " Like, a woman's 
place is in the mall"); and 
laDonna (Claudette Wells), a 
loud and sassy black girl who is 
unfortunately Beatts ' least 
successful character. 

To get the most out of this 
inspired cast of characters, 
Square Pegs is wisely not 
videotaped live but filmed, at a 
real (dormant ) high school. The 
show is saddled with an 
overactive, overloud laugh 
track, but that doesn't stop 
Beatts and her writers -
generally women - from 
placing offbeat humor around 
the edges of the scripts, like 
Sergio Aragones' cartoons in 
the margins of Mad magazine. 
for example , two of 
Weemawee's competitors are 
named Henry Wadsworth 
Longfellow Tech and Cardinal 
Spellman High - " our 
archrivals," Patty said, " to the 
right. " 

That last reference, which 

younger viewers could 
undoubtedly make neither head 
nor tail of, betrays the show's 
frequent '60s orientation (as 
well as the age of the writers), 
The character most representa-
tive of that period is teacher 
Rob " Love Beads" Donovan who, 
to make history interesting to 
his students, relates it to his 
own youthful escapades -
including a thinly-disguised 
reference to buying drugs (t) -
and quotes contemporary 
"authorities" like Sly Stone and 
George Carlin ("spol~esman for 
a generation " ). 

This unconventional 
approach ensures Mr. Donovan's 
popularity with his students, 
although Vinnie complain s, 
"That '60s stuff went out in the 
70s. " 

Des pit e a [I n i for m I y 
wonderful cast and delightfully 
detailed scripts, Square Pegs 
has been rather frustrating for 
much of its debut season. Part of 
the problem is the show's 
limiting concept : How to 
Become Popular in Thirty 
Minutes. More telling is its 
rushed tempos and timid plot 
lines, the readily apparent result 
of Beatts ' determined quest for 
success. 

Some of the episodes have 
had some bite, though. A show

might wonder if you 've been

or so .

LA bands that doesn·t rely on 
gimmickry to produce music. 
Despite Rand and file 's use of 
synthesizers in pop format they 
ha ve gone beyond th e 
dependency found in the 
present trend of music. 

Three O'Clock - known as 
.salvation Army until that 
august charity organization 
tool{ offense - is one of several 
promising LA bands that 
consciously recall the days of 
psychedelia and flower power. 
the others, including Redd 
Kross (once Red Cross). the 
Bangles (formerly the Bangs~ 
and Dream Syndicate (always 
Dream Syndicate). What these 
young groups have in common 
- aside from legal problems 
with their chosen names - is 
their ability to make the listener 
think he's hearing this music for 
the tirst time. Opening for Three 
O'Clock is Sold rarade. 

Having a definite Western feel 
to their music Rank and file has 
created legitimate rock and roll. 
The guitars and drums still hold 
a prominent position in the 
band, something lacking in 
their peers. Rank and file will 
play on March 1'; at the 
Backdoor. 

Complete with funny hats and guitars, Rank and file will perform next week at SDSU's 6ackdoor. 

Journeying to the worst 'frontiers' 
frontiers 
Journey 
Columbia 

As artists find their niche in 
music by creating a unique 
sound of their own more often 
than not this " unique" sound 
ends up being no more than a 
cheap rehash of run of the mill 
pop rock. With the rise of the 
Los Angele scene an expanded 
spectrum of musi c is now being 
purveyed. 

Before 91X changed its 
format very few San Diegans had 
heard of the rsychedelic furs. 
Now with the success in this 
area of their single " Love My 
Way" the Furs can look forward 
to an even greater reception 
than their last show earlier this

Journey has , as th eir 

popularity has i nc reased, 

On the one hand, one is 
subjected to the seemingly 
hardcore bands that cater to the 
ex-Kiss fans that now see 
t hemselves as hip. On the other 
hand there are bands that are 
caught in the pretention of 
European "sophistication ." In 
the middle of all ofthis there are 
the endless amounts of cover 
bands waiting to make it big, 
and just a few creative forces 
making progress.

Journey rel ied on musical

of guitarist Neal Schon, vocal

On albums such as Next and 
Look Into the future, Journey 
displayed fin e potential as a 
hard rock-fusion band. As time 
has progressed, however. 
Journey has sold out. · The 
sound of old Journey has 
deteriorated into a bubble gum. 

~cudo-intense sound fueled for 
and by junior highschoolers' 
dollars. 

Escape, Journey s 1981 
release, and a tremendous 
success, was the epitome of the 
"sell out" syndrome. cateri ng to 
dollars and not the production 
of music to musical potential. 
vocalist Steve Perry and new 
keyboardist (replacing Rolie) 
Johnathan Cain put together an 
insubstantial coll ec t ion of 

ballads and thudding hard rock 
that the kids loved and the 
c ritics hated Neal Schon 's solos 
were the only saving grace of 
Escape. Now Journey has given 
us f rontiers, the poorest excuse 
for fine music that they have 
ever produced 

Schon 's guitar ~\oork is 
grinding, one-chord nonsense 
except for a couple of solos that 
have been almost covered up by 
the pretentious keyboards of 
Cain. The ballads are e\en 
sorrier than the [scape, ersionc, 
of the ~me ovemorked cliches. 
The pseudo·hca\y metal songs

'Pegs': the 
hippest show 
on television 
continued from page <\ 
in which Mr. Donovan was to be 
fired for his "unconventional " 
behavior and for "not following 
the green text" paralleled 
closely the experience of the 
North County substitute teacher 
who was axed for advocating 
socialized medicine in class. 
The Square Pegs version had a 
happy ending, as Mr. Donovan's 
students rallied behind him by 
staging a sit-in and singing "We 
Shall Overcome." ("Passive 
resistance," Lauren explained, 
'like the movie Gandhi." Vinnie: 
"You mean we have to sit here 
for three-and-a-half hours?") 

Even better was a recent 
episode with a timeless, AII-
American subject: baseball. 
Featured were Vinnie as the 
Weemawee Braves' ace pitcher: 
Lauren as team manager (to be 
close to her beloved Coach 
Donovan): Patty as a struggling 
sports reporter for the 
Weemawee Tomtom; and Muffy 
as (what else?) a cheerleader. 
Also on hand was visiting Steve 
Sax of the lA Dodgers. ("Wasn 't 
he Rookie of the Year?" Patty 
asked, " Never mind that. " 
Lauren countered, " Have you 
see his poster?") 

The star of the show, though 
- and rightly so - was the one 
and only Johnny Slash . 
Intimidated by Vinnie into 
picking up a bat. he was 
discovered to have a propensity 
for knocking the ball out of the 
park. He was enlisted for the 
team even though he claimed 
"all that hitting goes against my 
personal philosophy " -
"What's that? " friend /"agent" 
Marshall asked: "No hitting" -
and proceeded to lead the 
Braves to nine straight home 
victories. 

His undoing was Weemawee's 
first away game, against the 
Cardinal Spellman Birds, as he 
found himself "disconnected" 
by the unfamiliar surroundings 
and retreated into a locker. His 
reasoning was eloquent, 
touching and a bit touched: " I 
like it at Weemawee. I know 
where everything is .. , Patty, 
lauren and Marshall. I don 't like 
it here, Everyobody looks 
different when they're not where 
you expect them to be. That's 
why I watch reruns on TV - I 
know what's gonna happen." 
You half-expected Johnny to 
click his cleats together and 
say, "there 's no place like home, 
there's no place like home","

year, With this popularity the 
Psychedelic Furs still have 
maintained a certain amount of 
quality in their revival of the 
psychedelic genre. The Furs will 
play this coming Tuesday at 
Montezuma Hall. 

WIth the trend in shows 
leaning towards smaller venues 
there has been a major move of 
artists to shows that don't hit as 
many people but give the 
audience a more Intimate 
experience. Most notably the 
recent Neil Young show brought 
the most succe to this end . 

streep is 
dominant 
as 'Sophie' 

By CLYDENt: Nt:[ 
It is interesting to see a film 

after it has won an Academy 
Award nomination to see 
exactly what Hollywood 

consider~ to be a good film, 
performance by an actor. or 
director. The one thing that you 
will notice about Sophie's 
Choice is that from the 
beginning to end it is Meryl 
Streep's film. 

Sophie's Choice is the film 
version of the best selling novel 
of the same title by William 
Styron. The story relates the 
experiences of a young writer 
called Stingo (played by Peter 
MacNicol) with two very unique 
individuals, Streep portrays 
Sophie Zawistowska, a beautiful 
Polish immigrant who survived 
the horrors of the Auschwitz 
concentration camp only to 
carry with her a deep dark secret 
that haunts her relationships 
with Nathan Landau (played by 
Kevin Kline, who can also be 
seell in The Pi ra tes of 
Penza nee ), her Jewish lover, and 
Stingo. 

Streep has done a 
magnificent job portrayi ng 
Sophie. This role has allowed 
her true versati lily as an 
accompl ished actress come 
through: she takes her character 
from light happy times in New 
York to the remembrances of 
the death camp of Auschwitz, 
showing a truly remarkable 
spectrum of emotions. 

Kevin Kline is stuck to Pleryl Streep in the new film 'Sophie's Choi(~." 

One of the more amazing 
aspects of the fit m is the accent 
that Streep uses for her roleasa 
Polish immigrant. For the 
audience Streep is Sophie and 
not just an American actress 
portraying a Polish immigrant. 
The scenes where she is 
speaking in German and Polish 
are so well done that it is hard to 
believe that she is not a native 
Polish or German speaker. 

As powerful as Streep's 
performance is the other actors 
in the film just cannot capture 
the intensity that she has. One 

performance which does come 
close is that put in by KeVin 
Kline. His characterization of 
Nathan landau, a more than 
slightly off-balance Jewish 
intellectual, is not a great 
performance, but he does 
capture the interest of the 
audience during his strange 
metamorphosis from a light-
hearted , happy, slightly off-
balance person to an ill 
tempered madman who would 
kill his best friends. 

The film is presently playing 
at Mann's Valley Circle.

Running Thoughts 
By MIKE GREENBERG and JEFF SAVAGE 

Stun Writl'r, 
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE DEPT, Some obi>crvalJons 
heading into fmal!:> week: Isn't it too bad that the campus IS not 
aware, or docs not fully appreciate thc accomplishments of the 
men's swimming team, Ten members of theclub will compele in 
Ihe Nationals in Ohio next week, perhaps the single greatest 
ach ievement a UCSD team has accomplished in the entire 1982· 
83 year ... Meanwhile, women's tennis Head Coach Liz Dudash is 
quietly producing a quality team Lhat could vic for the national 
title ... One has to feel tha t the men's basketball team let the 
public down wit h its first round playoff loss to Asuza one week 
ago ... 
WAIT A MINUTE DEPT. Do you want to knov,: what 
frustrat ion is? Frustration is owning a major indoor soccer team 
and nGt drawing enough fan s becausc the media refuses toco\'e r 
Ihe evenL. Such is the case with Sockers owner Bob Bell and the 
San Diego media . San Diego has repeatedly been in first and 
'iecond place all season long, but more often than not, th e team 
receives only page four treatment from the Tribun e, CHioll , and 
lhe San Diego County edition of the L(J.~ AII/!eles Times 
THEY ASKED FOR IT DEPT. Browsi ng through the 
baseball raecord book that we keep directly underneath our 
brochures of the Bahamas (and you thought you were going to 
have a good time during spring break) wecan across an item tha t 
was s impl y too unbelievable to pass up. Remember Jim Maloney 
of the Ctnicinnat i Red~? No matter, Ma lone\' cou ldn't have a ... ked 
for worse luck than he expenenced In 196;), The r{cd ~ 
righ thander pitched 10 hltles;, innings againsl the Ne\\ York 
:'I-lets in April. onl)- to lose 111 the lIth on a t\H/ run homer (the 
only hit he gave up). Two months later, Maloney pitched eight 
perfect innings, only to let a two base error upset hIS rhythm 
enough for him to make one mistake - agatn a two run homer. 
Finally, the determined right hander came through agatn ... L the 
lowly Chicago Cub" on hot day in July , but tl took an 
extraordin aryeffurt for him to do It. Maloney pItched ten htlless 
frames in Wrigely Field and for the firsl time he didn't ha\'c to 
worry about his team scoring any runs in the extra innings. 
Final Score: Cincinnati 10, Chicago O. ' 
COULD IT BE DEPT. Bad news fur sport s fans. The {'CSD 
Gual'diall perhaps the best source for s port s in the country. will 
most likely be forced toshut down forth eSpringQuarter. Due to 
the ris ing paper and typewriter ribbon costs (not to mention 
unexpected costs such as door repairs and squirrel feedingJ.the 
Guardia n is forced to resort to eltmination of one of its sections. 
Sport s Editor Phil Lauder volunteered to sacrifice the Sports

Bowling 

Here it is. For all you pinhead 
enthusiasts. The bowling playoff 
preview. Yes folks, Bowling! The sport 
you thought was only played late 
Friday night in a somewhat altered 
state. 

Bowling at UCSD is the fastest 
growing sport, from 6 teams at the 
now-closed Del Mar Lanes 5 years ago, 
to 42 teams this year at the Ciairemont 
Lanes. Bowling is getting so big rumor 
has it they may change Pryatel Field 
into a bowling center since no field 
sports can be played on a lake. 200 
lanes would be sufficient

Prognosis 
This squad invented the phrase 
'sandbag'. Defending champs should 
repeat. 
Most competitive team in non-
competitive sport should drive them a 
long way. 
Lots of experience but will probably 
eat the big banana In the final. Too 
many splits. 
Low average plus high handicap 
usually can mean a big reward. 
George has been complaining about a 
bad back all season. It gets heavy 
carrying your teammates. 
Definitely best dressed squad shows 
lots of class with their weekly goodwill 
bowling shirts. 
Have the averages to cause trouble. 
Only problem is bowling is keeping 
them away from the computers. 
The guys can roll It with the best of 
them. Should be there towards the 
end. 
The Budman's pick. It has to be, this 
squad is keeping me in business. 

One of the main attractions of 
bowling is that it totally captures the 
true spirit of intramural sports. There 
are no divisions of playas in other 
sports in the intramural program. The 
ringer 150 average bowler has no 
advantage over the gutter ball 80 
average bowler. Each bowler gets a 
handicap depending on his average. 
And of course the main ingredient is 
the comraderie. No sport has the 
unique atmosphere of bowling. 
Minimal competitiveness, a Bud, and a 
lot of fun In a coed sport. You can't 
beat the combination! Need some more coaching. Girls have

"O~~Ke":v Playoff Preview 

Someone just told me there is 
Floor Hockey being played this 
quarter. I can't believe this is true. 
Floor hockey was last quarter, 
wasn't it? Well I guess I'm terribly 
wrong. Supposedly there are 65 
Men's and Women's teams 
checking and slashing till 1 :30 am 
almost every night of the week. 
Man, these Floor Hockey guys and 
gals are nuts. I'm usually into my 
5th hour of cutting logs by then. 
Maybe that's why I didn't know 
there was any Floor Hockey this 
quarter. 

Floor Hockey has now moved 
into the playoffs. It should be one 
of the moct. hotly contested 
playoffs in ,., history. 

Let's start with the cream of the 
crop, Men's MA. This is the 
Canada of 1M Floor Hockey. These 
guys must all be from the hotbed 
of hockey the way they play. This 
diviSion is going to be the most 
evenly contested division in ~II of 
Floor Hockey. There is just no 
clear cut faVOrite. The perennially 
tough MPU squad who has won or 
come in second for what seems 
like eons didn't even make the 
playoffs thiS year. 

A hair separates these teams in 
ability. Only the styles differ. The 
Floor Whacks led by Floyd Shon 
are a very qUick team. They can 
beat you to the puck with their 
extreme speed The Floor Whacks 
are also unique In that they have 
worked their way up from Single 
'A' champions. They must have 
been sandbagging. Captain Dick 
and the S~amen IS also a very 
qUick squad. They are a bunch of 
young bucks and probably won't 
be a factor L oo~ for Joe 
DeSideriO to make them tough to 
beat. The Stray Cats can pl<'ly With 
the best of them but only when 
the leader of the band deCides to 

play. Todd Angelo IS hot and cold. 
He potentially is the best 1M 
player but only when he turns it 
on. Last but not least are the 
Broadstreet bullies of 1M Floor 
Hockey, the Jones Crushers. 
These guys' theme song is 'Let's 
Get Physical' and theydo. They do 
have some talent in Eric 
Humphries but Ashley is twice as 
quick as anybody on their team 
and he's a dog. 

Look for an upset with Jones 
Crushers winning in the final 
game. 

The M division is a whole 
different story You have the Phi 
Deltas, the Phi Deltas, the Phi 
Deltas, and the Phi Deltas. These 
guys are so good they should pass 
up AM and go right to the 
Stanley Cup. Led by Fabio Simi 
and Craig Lee they are basically 
unstoppable. The only thing 
better than their goal tending is 
their defense, and the only thing 
better than their defense is their 
offense. Bet the ranch on these 
guys. R.I.S.C. has an outside 
chance. Way outside. Dave Berry 
would have to play like Pete 
Peters in the nets. Sorry Dave I 
don't think it's possible. Well, at 
least you won the All-Cal. 

Single 'A' is supposed to be for 
all beginners so Its supposed to 
be a toss-up for the ~hampion­
Ship ThiS Isn't true thiS year. The 
FlYing Tigers have the talent to 
compete With the Phi Deltas. You 
know, the ones moving up to the 
NHL Another case of trying to get 
your mug on the 1M hall of 
champions These guys have been 
plaYIng Single 'A' Floor Hockey 
since the wreck gym was bUilt. 
Stacy Brown and Bryan Mitchell 
have as VICIOUS a slap shot as 
anybody In the NHL. In fact these 
two are so good they could 

Bift, MUffy, Buffy & Skippy. Play like dog 
food. 

Da, Da, Da." 

probably win 'AAA' by 
themselves, without a goalie. 
There are some other interesting 
teams to watch. Just watch 
though. There's Just A Bunch Of 
Guys. Nice team name, huh. They 
must have thought for hours to 
make that one up. No superstars 
on this squad. The Loud Team is 
another interesting team. They 
didn't have as good a season as 
they had hoped for, but then 
playing at 8:00 am Saturday 
denied them of their usual 
pregame rituals. Lastly there's 
Kami's For Burdashit. Nice guys in 
the wrong sport. Chinamen don't 
play hockey. 

Women's hockey, which is the 
largest women's sport in the IMs, 
will be a low scoring affair if the 
regular season was any indication. 
Either the defenses are excellent 
or the goalies are stingier than 
Lenny the Ref. The average 
number of goals scored for the 
regular season was 1 .8 The 
leaders on defense are the Pink 
Pantheress' and the Biohazards. 
Each team has allowed only two 
goals all season. But the Pink 
Pantheress' have scored only four 
goals all season and the 
Biohazards a whopping six goals. 
With defenses like these the 
Chargers would have won the 
Super Bowl crown. Course you'd 
h"ve to do something about the 
offense The faVOrites to win look 
like the Her Peas. These green gals 
ran up twelve goals and only 
allowed one goal all year. But they 
must get by Penalty For Early 
Withdrawal wIlo were last year's 
champions Penalty For Early 
Withdrawal stili has the talent but 
can't seem to get It together Look 
for Kathy O'Dell to lead this squad 
to a repeat championship by

It was very appropriate indeed last

to run their casino for them at the 9th 
annual UCSD Casino Night. After all, 
who better to manipulate the money, 
the crowds, the fast action, than a

looks that could kill. 

But few realized that the two gals 
from Italy were sisters and in their

Lisa and Gina Simone put on a 
smash performance Saturday evening 
in the Main Gym Casino with another 
rousing rendition of Casino Night. The 
tables were hot, the prizes fantastic 
(thanks in large part to Craig Denisoff,

time was had by all. Even 01' Blue Eyes 
made a cameo appearance and sang 
the lights out of "New York, New

FOR ALL YOU DO ... THIS 
BUD PAGE IS FOR YOU! 

Wilbert Is Super Once More 
As the 8th annual UCSD Superstars 

Competition approached its 
conclusion Sunday afternoon 
everything was supposed to be rather 
academiC. 

Rick Wilbert, the soft-spoken senior 
from Del Mar making his frnal 
appearance In thIS event, was 
preparing to go with a bang. 

Nearly everyone figured Wilbert to 
post a solid mark in the high jump, run 
his heart out in the mile, and waltz 
home with a new Superstars 
individual record and a second overall 
championship. 

But on this occasion it was not 
meant to be. Most likely because of 
the horrid weather, only the last of 
those objectives came true. But that 
was certainly good enough for 
Wilbert. 

Rick won his second title In three 
years with a personal best of 5976 
points in the 4-day, 2-weekend affair. 
And to be sure, he was pushed the 
entire way. 

Sophomore newcomer Steve Losil 
and varsity baseballer Eddie Novak 
made sure of that. Losil and Novak 
came through With sensational 
performances themselves. 5819 for 
Losli (4th best score ever in 
Superstars) and 5797 for Novak (6th 
on the all-time list). 

In fact, Losli made things awfully 
exciting for a while when he 
demoliShed the men's high jump field 
with an outstanding Superstars record 
leap of 6'1 3/4". And the 944 points he 
earned in that event brought him 
within a mere 20 points of Wilbert as 
they entered the final event of the 

competition, the dreaded one mile 
run. 

What might have been pure 
Hollywood drama was aVOided, 
however, when Wilbert chose to run 
In the first heat, whIle Losll, still 
warming down from his high Jump WIn, 
opted to walt for the third heat 

From that pOint on the competitIon 
was closed down. Wilbert, the 
consummate competitor, driVing 
himself through pesky headwInds and 
a soggy course, pulled away from the 
field and cruised home In 5,05. It was 
the only one that mattered 

Wilbert's 5976 total was plenty 
good enough ... second best on the all-
time list and hiS best performance In 
four years of attacking the Superstars 
point tables. In five of the nine events 
he entered he set personal bests In 

the other four he was Just a step or 
click away 

And after all of the numbers have 
been added up Wilbert will go down 
as perhaps the best UCSD student 
ever In thIS all-around event. Only 
three-year rival Craig Kreeger (who 
graduated last year) comes close 

Each won two Superstars titles In 
their years at UCSD Kreeger has the 
one-year record (6064), but Wilbert 
garnered the most pOints In four years 
(21,534 ) and had the best three year 
average (5872.3). 

When then finally decide to 
construct the Superstars Hall of Fame 
bUilding on campus near the "Sun

that these two Will be the first allowed

Of all of the redeeming values 
derived from athletIC competition, 
perhaps none is better exemplified 
than the comaraderie of united 
athletes pushing each other to the 
best of their physical capabilities. 

Each year without fail, the UCSD 
Superstars competition brings out the 
best in everyone. The best in spirit of 
competition, the best in competitive 
performance. And the just concluded 
1983 version was certainly no 
exception. Here were just a few of this

Elaine Bergman .. ... .... UCSD Volleyballer didn't quite approach her women's 
record performance of 1981, but this year she won three 
individual events, guys notwithstanding. 

Len Shulman ........ .. Ied all men this year with two individual event titles. HIS 
excellent 216 bowling mark (a new SS record ) was not 
half as surprising as his awesome display of power In the 
softball event. Displaying hiS wares for the many AM 
softball team captains in attendance, Larrupm' Lenny 
slapped 5 consecutive water-logged softballs Into the 
outer reaches of the infield to win thiS event gOing away. 

She won. the 60 in 7.67, the softball throw at 186 feet, 
and established a sensational record in the high jump 
(1000 pts) with a leap of 5'3" Sunday afternoon. 

In addition, whe contributed heavily with key points as 
her team walked off with the team championship. 

Gayle Flanders ......... this little junior competing in her first Superstars event 
was literally a stick of dynamite. Her 5390 points placed 
5th overall and moved into second place on the all-time 
women's list. In addition her 181 bowling mark erased a 
5-year old women's record. 

Steve Losli ...... ... .... cruised into the competition as a relative unknown and 
walked out with all kinds of respect. His 5819 points was 
the best ever by a first year performer and immediately 
sets him up as a solid favorite in this event for the next 
couple of years. His basketball/high jump double was 
one of the best ever (1851 points). 

Ed Novak ...... ... ... .. the little junior with unlimited potential has perhaps the 
best chance of smashing the individual record to 
smithereens. His 5797 was the sixth best ever, but still fell 
only a few 40-yard field goals short of being only the 
second person ever over 6000. 

Randy McNicholas ..... established himself as the most consistent over the 
entire 10 events, but fell a little short of hiS expectations 
in the end. His 5401 was still good enough for fourth 
place overall and moved him into 8th position on the all-
time list. 

Debbie Archambault ... a Dartmouth exchange student, Debbie blew the 
Superstars point table to shreds with a phenomenal 
basketball shooting display last weekend. She hit 13 of 
16 shots in a one-minute time trial including 5 swlshers In 
a row from 20-feet to completely obliterate the 
women's record In that event. Her 1237 pOint 
performance is the very best IndiVidual mark ever 
established in the 8 year history of Superstars 

Jody Mai .......... ,. this blonde bomber proved you don't need to be 
Hungarian to kick field goals She dusted all of the men 
kickers In the competItion WIth a perfect 5-for-5 
performance that scored her 920 points. Rumor has It 
that she got her experience last fall quarter trying to kick 
innertube Qolcu>~ers out of the tubes.

GUILD THEA

Oil 
continued from page 8 
s lips down, it will lower value 
and inflation, then the 
question will be, "How do you 
start trying to adjust for oil 
prices to keep up with 
inflation?" That will be the 
next primary task of OPEC if 
they avoid collapse, There is 
some question in the next two 
years because of the further 
implications for recovery, 

My own view is that after 
that we will see a sloppier oil 
market. [t willl<Xlk more like a 
roller coaster market, which is 
to say that [expect we will slip 
back, This will will look a little 
bit more like the classic 
commodity market, but again 
it is a commodity market 
where the minimai price is 
much higher than whal the 
real competiti\'e market price 
would be, The minimal' price 
stays much higher than what 
a true compet il iw price would 
be, but the actual price le\'el is 
much more \'olatlle than in the 
past. I \,ould e:-.peact Ihat the 
maximum increase , "It h 
IOflal ion aelju"tecl price" for 
OPEC oil over the la"t part of 
the H()~ \\ill amounl to about 
2.:i perCl'n I i ncrl'a~p, If Wl" rp 
lUCK ,. \\ 'hat dol''' than mean 
after what the r,I\'age-; of 
1I1f1atlOn han' done ,lln'ach: 
I'd dm that m Ih('('<Irl, 1 ~)9() \" 
the \~Iut: of OPEC 01'1 will be.' 
about $:16 pb (m the 90'" I 
expect them to do a lit tIl' bellt'r 
in the market) which IS 10 "a\

(J(hing in the nexl t " :0 year" 
is going to stop that from 
happening and then the, 'II
