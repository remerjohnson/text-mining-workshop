State Senator Proposes 10-Percent Cap on Fee Hikes

By Angela Chen
News Editor

In light of the highly protested November 
student-fee fee increase, state Sen. Jeff Denham 
(R-Merced) introduced new legislation Jan. 29 
aimed at preserving accessibility to public high-

er education. 
The Student Protection Act SB 917 would 

cap any future student-fee hikes at 10 percent, 
as well as require University of California and 
California State University officials to provide 
an 180-day waiting period between the approval 
of tuition increases and the date on which stu-
dents begin to pay the hike. 

There is no such waiting period at this time; 
the 32-percent fee increase approved by the UC 
Board of Regents last November went into effect 
at the beginning of Winter Quarter. 

According to Denham’s press secretary, Jan 
Taber, the senator introduced similar legislature 
in 2004, but it was not passed by the state senate. 

Denham was inspired to reintro-
duce the legislature in November 
after he heard the regents were 
planning to raise student fees by 
32 percent. 

“He thought it was ridiculous,” 
Taber said. “He decided to intro-

duce legislation because he feels strongly that 
students and parents should have time to plan 

if there’s a fee increase and 
avoid large, unexpected 
increases midway through 
school.”

Tabor said Denham 
believes the recent 
increases are keeping stu-
dents from graduating, or 
at least from graduating 
on time. 

According to Leslie 
Sepuka, media special-
ist at the University of 
California Office of the 
President, UCOP is con-
cerned that a student-
fee cap could negatively 
impact the quality of a UC 
education. 

“In the past, [the UC 
system] has been con-
cerned that student-fee 
caps could threaten [the 
UC system’s] ability to 
preserve the quality of the 
institution,” Sepuka said. 

For example, if the state were to cut the 
UC budget by another 20 percent — but the 
university was unable to raise fees by more 
than 10 percent — enrollment and courses 
may have to be reduced even more than they 
already have been. 

Sepuka added that the timing of the state 
budget’s release would make it difficult for the 
university to provide a 180-day waiting period 
between a tuition increase and its implementa-
tion. 

“We have regularly notified parents and 
students about the state budget situation and the 
likelihood of fee increases,” she said. “However, 
the timing of a state budget and funding deci-
sions could prevent [the UC system] from keep-
ing by a six-month deadline.”

In place of raising student fees, Denham 
suggested in his proposal that the UC system 
sell its off-campus properties;  most notably, 
the Richard B. Gump South Pacific Research

After encountering difficulties over con-
tract negotiations, students and staff are final-
ly making headway in the fight for joint own-
ership of the Sustainability Resource Center.

Members of the Student Sustainability 
Collective and administrators from the 
Campus Sustainability Staff met with Assistant 
Vice Chancellor Russell Thackston on Feb. 3, 
with students hoping to draw up a contract 
that would give both groups equal access to 
the center.

Students approached administrators two 
years ago about creating a space like the SRC 
to consolidate sustainability efforts around 
campus. 

The university provided funding for the 
center through the Green Initiative Fund, and 
SRC opened its doors last November. 

However, the SSC and CSS have been pro-
hibited by Campus Sustainability Coordinator 
Maggie Souder from using the space. Souder 
has continually pushed back the signing of the 
Memorandum of Understanding, or MOU, 
which is a legal document used to outline the 
SRC’s terms of use. 

In the interim, students have not been 
allowed shared ownership of the space.

The Feb. 3 meeting cleared lines of com-
munication between the two parties, whose 
discussions had come to a standstill after 
numerous disputes over the terms of the 
MOU.

Thackston will mediate negotiations 
between the two parties by comparing both 
their MOU proposals and finding a suitable 
compromise.

“[The SSC] has agreed to share with 
me  [their] preferred version of the MOU,” 
Thackston said in a statement. “I’ll com-

Org heads and admin. expect 
to settle the space-sharing
conflict by Week 10.

UCSD researchers have found a 
way to keep brain tumors from com-
ing back after remission.

Scientists discovered that a 
gene called KLHDC8 — or SΔE-1 
— inhibits the therapeutic drugs 
designed to halt the growth of a 
deadly, rapidly developing form of 
brain tumor known as a glioma. 

After this gene is removed, brain-
tumor patients have less chance of 
relapse. The discovery could help in 
the prevention and treatment of can-
cer by allowing doctors to target the 
tumors on a genetic level.

Under the current protocol of 
attacking cancerous tumors, doctors 
are forced to increase treatments — 
such as chemotherapy and radiation 
therapy — because their effectiveness 
decreases over time. However, these 
treatments can be toxic at high lev-
els, and have adverse effects on the 
patients.

Researchers began investigating 
why patients would respond to drugs 
and then relapse. They removed the 
known fuel for cancer growth, a pro-
tein called epidermal growth factor 
receptor (EGFR), in experiments on 
mice.

“When you’re looking 
at cancer and you want to 
target the cancer with a 
therapeutic [drug], you 
really need to know 
if the molecule that 
you’re targeting is 
required by the 
tumor to con-
tinue to grow,” 
said Frank 
Furnari, asso-
ciate adjunct 
professor at the UCSD School of 
Medicine.

By removing EGFR, scientists 
found it to be one of the main factors 
in starting, developing and maintain-
ing gliomas. However, they discov-
ered that — though the tumor would 

stop at first, and the mice would 
appear to recover — the cancer con-
tinued growing without the help of 
EGFR. There had to be something 
else causing tumor growth, they con-
cluded. 

The second factor was found to 
be KLHDC8 — present in high 

volumes in gliomas when 
EGFR was gone. The 

gene was deactivat-
ing the drugs that 
were trying to 
prevent tumor 
growth. 

Glioma treat-
ment would thus 

need to target both EGFR 
and KLHDC8 in order to curb the 
growth of cancer. 

“If you could treat with an EGFR 
receptor inhibitor, and you can 
treat with something that prevented 
the relapse, you might have a lon-
ger response [to tumor growth],” 
Webster Cavenee, professor of 
medicine at the UCSD School of 

Medicine, said.
If it can be proved that other 

types of cancer use KLHDC8 as a 
replacement for the EGFR removed 
by current cancer treatments, then 
Cavenee and Furnari’s discovery can 
be used to study other tumors. 

Currently, the research lab is 
looking to see how KLHDC8 is 
working with other genes to cause 
tumor growth without the help of 
EGFR, and how these other genes are 
individually contributing to tumor 
growth. They will also be looking at 
possible chemical compounds that 
can tackle these genes.

“What we found really leaves 
the groundwork for new ways to 
approach therapy, and to get around 
this problem of resistance to targeted 
drugs and brain tumors,” said Jill 
Wykosky, a postdoctoral fellow who 
worked on the experiment along with 
Akitake Mukasa.

“ I worked two jobs going through college. These types of increases would have forced me to drop out.” JEFF DENHAM
California state senator, R-Merced

STATE NEWS — On Jan. 29, state 
Sen. Jeff Denham (R-Merced) 
announced a bill to cap UC tuition 
hikes at 10 percent, annually. 
Although Denham claims his bill 
will alleviate our financial burden, 
it’s only a thinly veiled plan to 
expand the government’s power over 
UC operations. 

The Student Protection Act SB 
917 proposes restrictions on the 1960 
Donahoe Higher Education Act SB 
33 — which grants the regents the 
power to make any changes they feel 
will help the university. 

The Donahoe act also granted 
state-college systems full indepen-
dence from political influences. 
Restricting these existing provi-
sions would force the UC Board 
of Trustees to wait 180 days before 
implementing a fee hike, and cap 
the hike at 10 percent — giving the 
state government more control over 
the UC system, always a dangerous 
inlet for outside political interests. 
However well intentioned, the bill 
lacks specifics for implementation, 
and does not offer any sustaining 
solutions to our budget problems.  

Capping fee increases is a great 
idea, theoretically. States such as 
New Jersey and Arizona have capped 
annual tuition hikes at 3 percent 
and 5 percent, respectively, while 
Maryland has implemented a full 
tuition freeze on state colleges. 
But there’s one giant reason that 
California is different: Each of those 
state-college systems supports no 
more than 10 public universities; 
California supports 33. With respon-
sibility for so many more students 
and drastically fewer state funds, the 
fee cap is a one-size-fits-all solution 
that doesn’t account for California’s 
more intricate maze of higher-educa-
tion pathways and the varying ways 
in which they are financed.

Alongside steady decreases in 
state funding, tuition caps could 
severely damage the university’s abil-
ity to operate efficiently and offer 
a reputable education to all its stu-
dents. Recent budget cuts have forced 
UC campuses to cut enrollment, 
administer layoffs, increase class sizes 
and slash student services. It doesn’t 
matter if the bill makes tuition more 
affordable for students — if there’s no 
funding from the state, and no fund-
ing from the students, our university 
will dwindle to nothing.

In response to such concerns, 
Denham proposed that the UC sys-
tem become more “fiscally respon-
sible” and sell off its “vacation villas” 
in Hawaii and Tahiti. Should these 
island-fantasy resorts actually exist, 
one would think a mass student 
protest would have already erupted 
outside UC President Mark Yudof ’s 
office. However, upon further 
inquiry, it seems that the UC land in 
Hawaii and Tahiti is being used for 

research purposes (for example, UC 
Berkeley’s Gump station for terres-
trial and marine life is located on the 
Tahiti patch. Not exactly a locale for 
beachside Mai Tai-sipping.)

Why Denham would mislead 
the public into believing that the 
UC system is secretly maintaining 
tropical island vacation villas isn’t 
entirely clear. Perhaps it’s easier to 
make it seem that Yudof and the 
regents have been hiding a big, 
expensive secret from all of us than 
it is to find a way to provide the UC 
with state funding. 

Denham also suggested selling 
off the UC Institute for Mexico and 
the United States, a research center 
for foreign policy. Though it would 
be nice to see university higher-ups 
sacrifice their precious research 
institutes for undergraduate afford-
ability once in a while, Denham has 
no inside experience with particular 
aspects of the UC research universe, 
and is obviously just name-dropping 
the one that seems most random to 
him as an instant fix-it.

The senator’s uninformed sug-
gesting are further evidence that he’s 
less interested in protecting students 
than he is in pushing his frustration 
at the situation toward the regents, 
meanwhile giving a charitable sheen 
to his reputation. 

It’s easy to forget that the univer-
sity’s research sites provide all UC 

students a more valuable degree, 
along with the opportunity to intern. 
And on a larger, humanitarian level, 
research-lab discoveries are crucial 
in moving our nation and planet 
respectably and sustainably into the 
21st century.

We are, as Yudof often reminds 
us, a well-established research 

institution. 
Denham’s half-
baked proposal 
to sell off UC 
properties 
— nowhere 
has he even 
floated rough 
estimates as 
to how much 
revenue their 
sale would 
generate — is 
much more 
an emotional 
reaction to fee 
hikes than a 
helping hand 
to institutional 
success.

 Denham and his fellow state 
legislators must understand that the 
rising cost of tuition is only half of 
public higher education’s problem. 
Degree options are being slashed, 
lecture halls overfilled, library hours 
shortened and student services 
eliminated. The real root of our 

downfall lies in the lack of adequate 
voter support and legislative priority 
— which Denham’s bill does noth-
ing to correct. 

The only effective “Student 
Protection Act” would be one guar-
anteeing continual state funding for 
higher education — the only way 
the UC and CSU systems will be 
able to sustain themselves without 
resorting to tuition hikes. 

Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, in 
fact, has already proposed restoring 
$305 million to the university’s bud-
get for next year. In addition, in his 
latest State of the State address, he 
proposed amending the California 
Constitution to ensure that public 
universities will receive no less than 
10 percent of the total state gen-
eral fund. And while both of those 
proposals may wind up being little 
more than pipe dreams, they’re far 
more productive than taking away 
the regents’ rights to sucks us dry.

Denham’s proposal doesn’t pro-
vide feasible solutions to ensure the 
quality of our education; it’s more a 
transparent ploy to make the govern-
ment look like the good guy — and, 
if our failed state economy is much 
of an indicator, we’re not necessar-
ily in better hands with the state of 
California advising our finances.

Between my debaucherous New Year’s Eve and the caffeine-induced haze of midterms, I’ve 
come to an eye-opening conclusion: 
There’s no use in venturing to com-
mit to any kind of grand, life-chang-
ing New Year’s resolution anymore. 
At least not for me.

This year’s empty promise — to 
get to the gym more often — seemed 
doable enough. But try though I 
might to manage the two-minute 
walk to RIMAC from my apartment, 
I’m perpetually exhausted. It’s a bone-
chilling 65 degrees out, and the five-
pound box of Nutter Butters gracing 
my living room (love you, Grandma) 
looks a whole lot more tempting than 
whatever sweat-drenched treadmill 
may or may not even be open at the 
gym.

But — and I say this with all the 
seriousness of a vindictive nun — 
despite the fact that it’s Week Six and 
I still haven’t made it to the weight 
room, I’m not a lost cause, and nei-
ther are you. There’s another oppor-
tunity for self-improvement creeping 
around the corner next Wednesday: 
a little 40-day vacation from self-
indulgence called Lent.

Before provoking any evangelist 
accusations, bear in mind that not 
only am I not actually Catholic, it’s 
only a matter of years until I get gay-
married before a gathering of pro-
choice, Bible-rejecting heathens like 
myself. (God and the U.S. Supreme 
Court willing, preferably on Maui. To 
Anderson Cooper. But we can save 
that one for another Monday.)

See, amid all the bro-induced mis-
ery of my Catholic-school past, one 
shining, notably less shitty memory 
stands out. One of our many high-
school traditions (along with the 
ritualized heckling of disabled kids 
and the choir) was monthly mass 
in the gym — a universally dreaded 
occasion that brought us together 
in shirt-and-tie solidarity, if not any 
closer to God. 

Whether it was the visiting Bishop 
Wang (a source of wonder not only 
for his surname, but also his praise 
of the “whore-y spirit”) or another 
preacher who imparted the message 
a few years back, I can’t be sure. But 
what I do remember is this: For once, 
the bishop’s words on Lenten sacrifice 
(i.e., giving up masturbation or video 
games, or any other teenage vice, for 
six weeks) compelled me to focus 
on something other than the pack of 
mint Milanos I’d be devouring within 
the hour. 

Bishop Wang didn’t want us to 
shelve our PS2 controllers or resist 
peeking at our dads’ Playboy collec-
tions for Lent — oh, no. He urged us 
to go one holy step farther and take 
up a new habit. Preferably something 
charitable, like feeding the poor or 
leaving the choir boys to sing without 
shouting “GAY!” mid-chorus. Lent, 
he insisted, should be seen as an 
opportunity to bring some positivity 
into the world — not just to do away 
with the negative. 

The season of self-improvement 
doesn’t have to be all about getting a

six-pack, either. There are plenty of 
things most of us don’t do — recycle 
pizza boxes, eat vegetables, use den-
tal dams — and there’s no time like 
the present for a trial run.

Despite four years of religion 
classes (another memorable teach-
ing: that “safe sex” is, in fact, a 
media-propagated myth), that win-
ter morning’s lesson was the only 
one that really stuck. Think about 
it: What better instrument for self-
betterment could there possibly 
be than one that gives you an easy 
out after a few new-and-improved 
weeks? Why resolve to work out 
for an entire year — and then feel 
vaguely guilty for passing the gym 

on the way for a pint of Ben & 
Jerry’s — when I can give it a few 

weeks and 
call it quits, 
just in time 
for a proper 
Easter din-
ner? 

Of 
course, I’ve 
got noth-
ing against 
positivity 
and charity 
and saving 
the children. 
But what 

I’ve found, after countless failed 
attempts at this elusive concept 

called self-improvement, is that not 
only am I cripplingly lazy, I can’t 
very well motivate myself to fix any-
thing if I’m too overwhelmed by the 
prospect of getting out of bed before 
10 a.m. in the first place. 

That’s why it’s so important to 
start small. Sure, I may not be able 
to get my ass out of bed before the 
end of the “The View,” but I can cer-
tainly manage to spend 20 minutes 
on the elliptical after class through 
the end of the quarter. Just as 
long as Beyonce propels me to the 
exhausting end of mile two, there’s 
still the promise of return to my 
comfy sofa (a perfect arm’s length 
away from that prized cookie box) 
when Easter finally rolls around.

ON THE LINE By Christina Aushana

<PIVS�/WL�NWZ�I�;MKWVL�4Iba�/W�I\�;MTN�1UXZW^MUMV\

Dear Editor,
It is deplorable that the Guardian 

— which so often follows the stories 
of environmentally conscious student 
groups — would take a less-than-
green approach to their own organi-
zation.

While enjoying my lunch one 
afternoon I noticed a student distrib-
uting a new issue of the Guardian. He 
took the monstrous pile of leftover 
papers, balanced it atop a trash can 
and walked to the next stand. I sat 
there wondering if he would come 
back, fully expecting him, as a repre-
sentative of this paper, to recycle the 
papers. To my dismay he did return, 
only to chuck the leftovers into the 
trash can without hesitation.

I am not a math major or any-
thing but a colossal amount of papers 
are being wasted every year if this 
is the normal behavior for your dis-
tributors. The each issue is about 12 
pages long, and the discarded stack 
must have numbered 50 papers. 
Multiply that by all the newspaper 

stands littering the campus and take 
into mind that the Guardian distrib-
utes two times a week — countless 
thousands of Guardian issues must 
be rotting in San Diego landfills 
instead of being recycled.

As a paper that reports on the 
campus’ green initiatives and as 
members of a society that is increas-
ingly promoting environmental 
awareness, these actions are unac-
ceptable. Please look into incorpo-
rating recycling practices for your 
distributors, if not for the student 
committees you cover or the planet 
we all live in, then for your integrity 
as a paper.

Despite allegedly good intentions from the 10 U.S. cross-bear-ing missionaries who snatched some 33 Haitian preschoolers 
in an effort to herd them to the Dominican Republic, these grown-
ups should have wisened to the one basic religious principle: 
“Thou shalt not traffick children.” 

It’s a shame that the U.S., which has deployed 20,000 troops to 
aid the earthquake-ravaged nation and raised $555 million in relief 
funds, is now being slapped on the wrist with a ruler and forced to 
wear the global dunce cap because of these misguided idiots. We 
already have a shaky enough international reputation, so this hic-
cup by 10 individuals should certainly not be taken as a reflection 
on our nation as a whole, or on — everyone’s favorite scapegoat — 
President Barack Obama. 

The accused individuals have argued that a Haitian pastor 
authorized their removal of the children, signifying that religious 
duty trumps actual law, in their world. But in separating children 
from their living relatives — the alleged kidnappers failed to real-
ize that some of the kids weren’t actually without family. So let it 
rain on these airheads’ parade — but leave the U.S. government 
alone, because for once, we’re not the bad guys.

— Kelsey Marrujo  
Senior Staff Writer

The New York Times, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC all have one thing in common — they’ve each published over two 
dozen articles on the 10 American Baptists. And while the inci-
dent was indeed newsworthy, the degree to which the press has 
focused in on this issue is detracting from the larger problem at 
hand: Haiti is in a crisis.

The country’s death toll has risen to 212,000, and those who 
survived last month’s earthquake face grave conditions. By giv-
ing so much attention to the 10 Americans that may or may not 
have abducted a group of Haitian children, the press is drawing 
our eyes away from what truly matters: aiding the country in its 
relief efforts.

Instead of reporting on whether or not the 10 Americans 
will be able to make bail, the greater focus must be on helping 
repair the hundreds of thousands of lives that have been devas-
tated by the natural disaster. Pushing ourselves into the interna-
tional spotlight in the face of foreign tragedy isn’t only absurdly 
self-centered; it’s unfair to the nation whose recovery will be a 
long and grueling process yet.

— Cheryl Hori
Associate Opinion Editor 

Ten Americans who tried to take 33 Haitian children across the border to the Dominican Republic have been charged 
with abduction and criminal association — and while they’re 
clearly in the wrong, it should be obvious they were acting out 
of naive idealism, not calculated evil.

The detainees, most of whom are Baptist missionaries from 
Idaho, claim they wanted to take the children to what they 
described as an orphanage. But Haitian officials say the group 
lacked the proper documents to transport the children out of 
the country.

All 10 of the detainees were so ridiculously unaware that 
they were doing something unlawful that they said they were 
surprised when they were detained by Haitian Laura Silsby, 
the group’s leader, and even asked that they be released and 
allowed to continue their work in Haiti.

Yet there seems to be a deeper story to all this.
Maybe no one had malicious intentions. But while nine of 

the group’s members did not know that official paperwork was 
needed to cross the border, Silsby was, in fact, warned that she 
could be charged with trafficking if she tried to take children 
out of Haiti without documentation.

Why did she go through with it, and how was she able to 
convince the rest of the group to go along with her? The only 
reasonable answer: a starry-eyed dream of bringing abandoned 
children to safety. Except that not all of them were actually 
abandoned. Sure, the groups actions were irresponsible, but it 
looks like Silsby’s prior knowledge of Haitian regulations might 
get the rest of the group off the hook.

pare it to the [students’] proposed 
MOU, and follow up with another 
meeting with the SSC representa-
tives.”

The students’ appeal to 
Thackston was not their first 
attempt to negotiate a space agree-
ment with administrators. SSC 
members have previously met with 
Associated Students Advisor Lauren 
Weiner, University Centers Director 
Paul Terzino and Assistant Vice 
Chancellor of Student Life Gary 
Ratcliff for guidance on how to 
approach the situation. 

“We sought advice from high-

er level administration on how to 
proceed with the situation,” SSC 
Student Director Rishi Ghosh said. 
“They were very helpful and made 
sure not to side with anyone, but 
just offer advice.”

Both parties also met with the 
University Centers Advisory Board 
on Jan. 25 to air their concerns 
regarding the MOU.

UCAB encouraged the two 
groups to resolve the matter by 
Week 10.

“The consensus was that if there 
was still dispute after 10th week, 
they would be more strict with the 
lease and apply more pressure,” 
Ghosh said.

According to Ghosh, members 
of the SRC say the organization is 
incorrectly leased under the depart-
ment of External and Business 
Affairs and is more appropriate-
ly categorized under the depart-
ment of Resource Management and 
Planning. 

The organization plans to peti-
tion to change the lease to be 
under Vice Chancellor of Resource 
Management and Planning Gary 
Matthews, who oversees the same 
department Thrackston works for. 

As an incentive to move discus-
sions along, UCAB members said 
they will not transfer the lease until 
the dispute is entirely resolved.

Both parties agreed that 
Thackston’s new role in MOU nego-
tiations has accelerated and facili-
tated the process.

“We’re moving forward at a much 
faster rate now,” Ghosh said.

Thackston was also optimistic.
“I’m confident that with more dis-

cussion — and willingness on every-
one’s part to be flexible in achieving 
our common vision — we will be able 
to develop an MOU that provides 
the framework for a long-term pro-
ductive and symbiotic partnership,” 
Thackston said.

234 teams of volunteers  to aid in disas-
ters all over the world since 1988.

“It was a chance to help out in 
a nation that was already in poor 
conditions,” Sloane said. “The sever-
ity of the natural disaster called for a 
worldwide effort. “

Sloane and his colleagues treated 
thousands of patients in partially 
destroyed hospitals and tents, per-
forming intensive surgeries and ampu-
tations and treating other injuries.

The influx of patients in the imme-
diate aftermath of the earthquake 
overwhelmed the available medical 
care and equipment, much of which 
had been damaged by the quake. 

According to Sloane, the destruc-
tion soon revealed itself to be worse 
than anything anyone had predicted. 
At the Haiti University Hospital in 
Port-au-Prince, Sloane and his col-
leagues were forced to treat patients 
without the help of resources such as 
running water, electricity, oxygen, an 
ICU unit and basic sanitation supplies.

“There was limited medical care, 
limited food and water,” Sloane said.

According to Sloane, even though 
the UCSD Medical Center donated 
many essential medical sup-
plies and pharmaceuticals 
to the relief effort, these 
resources were quickly 
exhausted.

“The situation there was 
really rough,” Sloane said. 
“There was so much pain 
and suffering. [It was hard 
to see] young people dying 
from medical illnesses.”

In the first few days of 
their stay there, the doctors 
treated almost 200 patients 
a day. Many patients were 
treated for wounds that 
were days old. Fractures and 
infections developed into 
cases of gangrene and teta-
nus, requiring amputation.

Sloane said that patient 
access to medical care might have been 
hindered due to political strife between 
local administrations and foreign aid 
organizations.

 “It was a politically hot topic,” 
Sloane said. “The administrator in the 

hospital wanted to be in control, but 
was ineffective in administering the 

hospital. It took five to 
six days of negotiating to 
allow NGOs to help work 
in the hospital.”

The power struggle 
prevented critically ill 
patients from receiving 
immediate treatment. 
According to Sloane, the 
tensions settled over time 
and outside doctors were 
allowed in.

Initially, foreign orga-
nizations assumed lead-
ership roles and worked 
alongside Haitian pro-
fessionals. As the relief 
teams trickled out though, 
Haitian doctors were re-
integrated into the system 
and began assuming their 

original positions. 
“The Haitians were very apprecia-

tive of the help the world gave,” Sloane 
said. “They understood the intensity 
of the situation, and were grateful for 
the support.”

Buono, whose five-year-old patient 
Monley Elize drew international media 
attention when he was rescued after 
spending eight days under rubble, said 
she is impressed with the way the 
Haitian people are handling the situ-
ation.

“These people are wonderful peo-
ple — they are willing to help them-
selves — but we want to just give them 
that little bit of boost, because they’ve 
really been knocked back 10 steps by 
this earthquake,” Buono said.

Sloane agreed.
“Even with the pain and suffering, 

the Haitian people came across as very 
strong,” Sloane said. 

Now, Haiti’s need has switched 
from emergency medical care to 
reconstruction. Many buildings were 
destroyed in the quake, leaving hun-
dreds of thousands homeless.

Though Sloane has no immediate 
plans to return to Haiti, he said that the 
International Relief Team will be send-
ing more teams to Haiti in the future.

Station, located in French Tahiti and 
paid for by the university fees as well 
as from researchers using the space. 
“The UC system has millions worth 
of property, beautiful pieces of land” 
Taber said. “There’s a lot of waste, and 
the UC system should sell its prop-
erty to offset the cost.”

Denham also suggested the 
University of California shut down 
the UC Institute for Mexico and the 
United States — or UC Mexus, a 
Riverside-based organization dedi-
cated to doing studies on Mexico. 

“They need to be serving the stu-
dents in California first,” Taber said. 

Sepuka said it is unlikely that 
either UC Mexus or the Gump 
Foundation would be closed down, 
as they are integral parts of the 
University of California. She said the 
Gump property is a large donation 
from businessman Richard Gump, 
who intended that the land be used 
for scientific research. 

“[The foundation] is probably the 
best value per buck in the UC sys-
tem, considering that almost all of 
the operating budget comes from 
user fees and external grants,” Sepuka 
said.“Plus, the station has brought 
in millions of dollars for research, 
including grants from the National 
Science Foundation and the Moore 
Foundation.”

The bill is scheduled for a hearing 
in March. It will need to be approved 
by a number of committees — 
including the Senate Committee on 
Education and the Senate Committee 
of Appropriations — before it goes 
before the state senate.

A s the intellectual anchor and celebrity headliner of the visual

lecture series, Alain Badiou is 
kind of a big deal. 

Aside from the fact that 
he’s the former philosophy 
chair at the Ecole Normale 
Supérieure, whose faculty 
has included minds such as 
Althusser, Derrida and Lacan 
— his scholarly squabbles 
with postmodernist schools of

INFOCUS DIVAS IN DENIAL XV

Last Saturday, UCSD’s proudest cross-dressing divas and divos put their alter-ego stashes of sequin dresses and baggy jeans to good use in the Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender 
Queer Intersexual Association’s 15th annual Divas in Denial catwalk 
extravaganza.

Participating kings and queens shook, sashayed and otherwise 
got low to a packed Price Center West Ballroom. 

Divas in Denial staple Swedish Sapphire (sometimes known as 
Muir College senior Daniel McDonald) passed out tampons and 
Mardi Gras beads — “But don’t show me your tits,”  he warned, “I don’t 
want to see them!” — during his Lady Gaga mashup/striptease. 

Comedian Carlos Mencia even made a guest appearance, 
performing standup (word is still out on whether the material was 
stolen), as did the Little Mermaid, who sang “Wish I could have... a 
vagina”  to the tune of  “Part of Your World.”

Daughters of Triton — an all-female student singing group 
— was also on hand to belt out acapella renditions of drag-show 
standards such as Gloria Gaynor’s “I Will Survive,” as well as new 
classics like Beyonce’s “Halo.”

The show climaxed with a fashion show that included all the 
performers and any audience members dressed in drag — a fierce 
finale to close out two hours of good old-fashioned gender-bending.

14-episode campaign to expose 
Jones’ “radical” history.

 Along with being accused of 
signing a petition suggesting that 
9/11 was planned by the Bush 
administration, Jones was cornered 
about his membership in Socialist 
International — an umbrella orga-
nization of smaller political parties 
— in the early ’90s. To make mat-
ters worse, he was recorded calling 
Republicans — as well as himself 
— “assholes” at a UC Berkeley 
lecture. 

Needless to say, conservative 
assholes were royally pissed — 
Glenn Beck included. 

While it probably wasn’t the first 
time the party’s members had been 
called a mean name, the latter com-
ment sealed Jones’ resignation on 
Sept. 6 last year. 

Lucky for us, Jones has since 
gone back to lecturing. 

Peeling off the bestselling suc-
cess of his book The Green Collar 
Economy, published in 2008, Jones 
will be joining a long list of speak-
ers — including Toni Morrison, 
Noam Chomsky and Carlos 
Fuentes — who’ve participated in 
the Helen Edison Lecture Series, 
UCSD Extension’s free quarterly 
talks on humanitarian topics. A 
nongovernmental organization 
entrepreneur (he’s started two) 
and seasoned advocate of whatever 
your cause, Jones will be speaking 
on the potential growth of green 
jobs within the U.S. economy. 

Jones’ talk comes at an appro-
priate time, since the president 
has made it clear the country is 
gunning to carve a global niche of 
green technology in coming years.

improving products to predicting our 
search behavior. He’s known as chief 
economist at Google, but you might 
recognize his name from a New York 
Times business column or your ECON 
100A and 113 textbooks — yeah, he 
wrote them. Now, Varian will be hold-
ing court on campus as part of UCSD’s 
Economics Roundtable Lecture Series. 

Varian’s lecture — “Predicting the 
Present With Google Trends” — will 
likely be based on a paper he penned 
in April 2009 with Hyunyoung Choi, 
a colleague at Google. In the paper, 
the two argue that Google searches 
can often serve as a reliable indicator 
of current economic activity. 

Your Varian textbooks will tell you 
that many economic indicators are 
subject to time lags; for example, a 
report on this month’s car sales won’t 
be published until next month. And 
unemployment rates are based on sur-

vey data from past months. 
Google Trends, a section of the 

site, allows you to track keyword 
searches over time. Varian and Choi 
believe that if there is a surge in 
“Prius” searches, for instance, that 
might indicate a similar surge in Prius 
sales. Or, if the volume of searches for 
“unemployment benefits” is decreas-
ing, that might indicate a similar 
decrease in unemployment. 

You won’t know for sure until 
sales reports are published or the 
joblessness surveys are compiled and 
analyzed in a study — but, as Varian 
will likely argue on Feb. 18, analyzing 
Google searches can help make short-
term predictions more accurate when 
coupled with existing forecast models. 
This is useful for those who want to 
get ahead of the market — like inves-
tors, or social scientists looking to 
make their research more precise.

Varian’s lecture, like his paper, will 

probably be full of technical lingo 
and fancy econometrics — chart- and 
graph-heavy PowerPoints included. 
Jargon aside, though, it isn’t too dif-
ficult to comprehend his hand in 
the monopolistic success of Google. 
During his stint at the company, 
Varian has overseen a drastic transi-
tion in the way Google does business. 
Instead of selling ad space “Mad 
Men” style, companies bid for the 
coveted spots in an electronic auc-
tion. The winner is determined by 
mathematical formulas that also take 
into account how well the ad matches 
up with our search terms. This way, 
when we Google “happy hour,” links 
to buy Viagra won’t show up in our 
search results — no matter how 
much the pharmaceutical companies 
bid. You can thank Varian for that.

CLUBHOPPING

A year after Model United Nations at UCSD came togeth-er in 2006, the organization 
was hosting a competition in Eleanor 
Roosevelt College for over 170 high-
school students with a passion for 
international relations.

When Rebecca Saar — current sec-
retary general, a diplomatic moniker 
for president — and Vijaya Surampudi 
joined their freshman year, they 
decided to head a Home Conference 
Committee. The team was responsible 
for hosting the Model United Nations 
competition for high-school students. 

“We had nothing in common 
— I was in Warren, she was in ERC 
— except for the fact that we were 
both really passionate about MUN,” 
Surampudi said.

In four short years, MUN at UCSD 
has become a solid leg of the organiza-
tion at large, partnering with Eleanor 
Roosevelt College and hosting its 
own simulated United Nations debate 
competition — even earning the 
title of “best organization” at Eleanor 
Roosevelt College’s 2007-08 end-of-
the-year awards ceremony. 

“When we approached [former] 
Provost [Ann] Craig, she was really 
excited,” said Surampudi. “I think she 
liked that we were showing prospec-
tive students how great of a school 
UCSD was — especially ERC and the 

political-science department.”
The two-day conference — com-

plete with guest speakers, a trained 
staff, complimentary breakfast, an 
all-day snack bar and a dance to follow 
the first day’s debate — drew over 200 
student participants this year. 

“It’s the fact that we’re trying to 
build UCSD’s reputation as a political-
science school — everyone knows it as 
a science, engineering and tech school, 
but there’s also a good political-science 
department that we can represent 
through MUN,” said Saar. 

And Home Conference is just 
a small part of the club’s activities. 
When members aren’t busy hosting 
competitions, they’re attending similar 
functions at other universities, drafting 
resolutions and competing for delega-
tion awards (based on a point system 
measuring each ambassador’s ability 
to diplomatically cooperate with other 
member states). This year, MUN at 
UCSD was invited to Harvard’s annual 
five-day competition.

“Getting invited to a prestigious 
competition like Harvard’s is amaz-
ing — I mean, it’s filled with people 
who are passionate about international 
politics, and will be the ones eventu-
ally making international policy,” said 
Surampudi.

MODEL UNITED NATIONS
COURTESY OF REBECCA SAAR

and how it interacted with the reader, 
the author and the author’s words. 

He shifted from word to action 
by the end of the decade, when he 
transitioned into performance and 
video art, continuing his exploration 
of space through bodily pieces that 
challenged object-subject relations 
and public-private distinctions. 

His most famous — and most 
controversial — work, Seedbed 
(1972), involved Acconci lying under 
the floor of a gallery, masturbating 
and speaking his fantasies into a 
microphone, while the people walk-
ing above listened through loud-
speakers.

Acconci turned to structural 
design and construction in the 1980s 
— action to architecture. His instal-
lations still relied on audience par-
ticipation: In one piece, viewers rode 
a bicycle to activate machinery that 
erected the walls of a house. 

In Acconci’s current work, the 
focus on movement within space 

remains. The architecture and instal-
lations of Acconci Studio, founded 
in 1988, are fluid, organic structures 
designed for activity and mobility. 
One of the studio’s most well-known 
works is an artificial shell-shaped 
island of glass, steel and blue light 
floating atop the Mur River in Graz, 
Austria. It houses a cafe, playground 
and amphitheater, and is connected to 
both banks by suspended walkways.

Although his career has evolved 
over various mediums, Acconci’s 
work can’t hide its literary beginnings. 
In a winter 2006 interview with writer 
Shelley Jackson, he described his 
architecture as a sort of language.

“The rest of the sentence of the 
world still exists, but we make this 
parenthesis within it. Then maybe 
sometimes you start the parenthe-
sis, but you forget to end it, and 
the clause instills itself into the real 
world.”

amuscara@ucsd.edu.

Trained as a mathematician, 
Badiou’s philosophical career has 
largely been a protest against the post-
modern craze infatuating wide-eyed 
students the world over. Refusing to 
label the current era distinctly “post-
modern” like most contemporaries, 
he’s made more enemies than any 
intellectual could hope for. 

Badiou’s ideas, some might say, can 
be a bit dense — blending the anti-
modernism of Slavoj Zizek (who’s eas-
ily more colorful) with contemporary 
politics while meting out math (and 
conceptual diagrams) throughout; it’s 
easy to see how dry seems a fitting 
adjective — but at least it’s illustrated. 

Though his lectures are usually 
delivered in a wooden, three-word 
rhythm — punctuated with nodding 
glances and pages under his palm — it 
does help us keep up with the momen-
tum of his ideas.

CHURCHILL CIGAR LOUNGE

SITESEEN C igars are pretty badass. Gangsters smoke them after 
killing people, billion-
aires put them out with 
wads of money and Bill 
Clinton uses their tubes 
to pleasure his interns. 
Best part is, you too, 
young college student, 
can feel the same power 
and sexual prowess our 
idols derive from a burn-
ing brown stick — all it 
takes is a short trip to 
Churchill Cigar Lounge 
in Old Town.

Though you’ll have to 
stomach Old Town’s faux 
cowboy decor to get to 
the dim-lit corner store, 
its vast inventory of dif-
ferent smokes — from 
strawberry blends to $65 
boss-man picks — make 
it worth the neighbor-
hood’s tortilla-plastered 
streets. 

Even better, if you haven’t spent half your student 
loans developing a palate for spiced tobacco, a gruffy 
staff member whose throat has endured years of 
cigar indulgence will help you find what you’re look-
ing for.

Beginners should try the Griffin’s natural robusto 
— a mild, mellow, five-inch smoke that’s fun to puff 
and only costs $12. Once you’ve picked your cigar, 
a Churchill employee will cut its tip, hand you some 
matches and suggest a drink that complements its 
flavor.

(Technically, you have to be 21 to even enter the 
cigar shop, but if you’re just looking to buy and go, 
they might let it slide. Plus, if you want to show off 
your cool new habit, your purchase is best smoked 
out in public or at a party, anyway.)

Once you have your 
drink in hand, either 
join the usual gathering 
of grumbly old clientele 
at the bar or hide away 

on the patio. All sex appeal and power aside, watch-
ing smoke roll out your mouth and into the air is 
a simple and unappreciated form of relaxation. It 
might even be enough to make you forget the lame 
Wild West statues and rose vendors creeping from 
behind.

Basketball Coaches Association 
Pink Zone game to support the fight 
against breast cancer, sporting pink 
jerseys in honor of the occasion. 

After a slow start, the Tritons 
took over the game, led by 19 points 
from Carlisle. Junior forward Tiffany 
Hunter, the reigning California 
Collegiate Athletic Association player 
of the week, added 11 points and six 
rebounds for the Tritons. 

The team struggled from the floor 
in the first half — shooting only 34 
percent on nine-of-26 shooting — 
but was jump-started in the final 
minute by three-pointers from Ilg 
and Carlisle.

The Tritons led 29-19 at halftime.
That momentum pushed the team 

throughout the second half, putting 
the game out of reach with a thun-
dering 28-0 run. UCSD never let 
up its defense, and the Eagles were 
unable to score for over 10 minutes 
of regulation. 

Despite the resounding conference 
victory, Ilg said the Tritons should 
focus on their postseason goals.

“We realize that we have goals that 
are beyond just the game at hand. We 
need to be able to play 40 minutes 
of intense basketball,” she said. “The 
postseason is almost here, and we 
need to be ready to compete with the 
best teams in the nation.”

The wins moved UCSD to 19-1 
overall and 14-1 in conference play.

UCSD will play a pair of road 
games this week: They stop by Cal 
State Stanislaus on Friday, followed 
Chico State on Saturday.

SPORTS� MONDAY, FEBRUARY 8, 2010� THE UCSD GUARDIAN 15 

Dorsey missed them both, and Lawley held 
his nerve to sink two free throws — taking 
the score to 81-75. The Tritons held on for 
a six-point win. 

Senior guard Tyler Acevedo connected 
on three shots from beyond the arc for the 
Tritons to finish with 13 points, and team-
mate Casey Ryan put together his third 
double-double of the season with 12 points 
and 11 boards.

The Golden Eagles shot at 46 percent as a 
team from the field, and were led in scoring 
by senior guard Chris Fields, who finished 
with 22 points. He hit seven of 15 shots 
from the field and added five rebounds, four 
assists and two steals. Dwayne Jones finished 
with 19 points, while Chris Robinson added 
16 and Leland Jones chipped in with 15. 

Both teams hit six triples in the game, 
and each finished with 17 points off turn-
overs.

With the win, UCSD is now 5-13 overall 
and 4-11 in California Collegiate Athletic 
Association play. The loss dropped CSULA 
to 12-9 overall, and 8-8 in league action.

The Triton win came on the heels of a 
closely contested 58-68 home defeat against 
Cal State Dominguez Hills on Thursday, 
Feb. 4.

The Tritons lost the game despite solid 
efforts from Lawley and Ryan, who com-
bined for 43 of the Triton’s 58 points.

Lawley posted a game-high 24 points on 
seven-of-ten shooting, with three triples and 
seven rebounds. Ryan was nearly perfect 
from the floor, connecting on nine of his 10 
field goal attempts to finish with a career-
high 19 points, and also pulled down eight 
rebounds.

Ultimately, Dominguez Hills won the 
physical battle on the glass, outrebounding 
the Tritons 39-30. They were able to translate 
this advantage into 13 second-chance points.

UCSD played a key role in its own 
demise with woeful shooting from the free-
throw line. The team went 13-for-25 from 
the charity stripe.

The Tritons are back in action next week, 
traveling to Cal State Stanislaus on Feb. 12 
and Chico State on Feb. 13.

Sophomore center Christian Hatch posted a career-high 23 points — adding 11 rebounds for his third double-double of the season — in 
a home game against CSULA on Feb. 6. Hatch has averaged 12.3 points and 9 rebounds in his last three games.

tournament.
“I’m very disappointed with how 

I performed,” Okasaki said.  “I have 
been struggling lately with a couple 
of shots that I rely on. It’s my irons 
and a little knock down that controls 
the trajectory and distance.”

Without his usual control, 
Okasaki said he had trouble consis-
tently finding greens to give himself 
an opportunity to go lower.

Senior Richard Morris and soph-
omore Justin Gabbert had their own 
troubles firing their highest scores 
this season. However, Okasaki said 
he is optimisitc the team’s perfor-
mance will improve after a good 
week of practice.

“We had a practice round that 
went well on Wednesday and a pro-
ductive practice Friday,” he said. “If 
we can start playing better individu-
ally, we will play better as a team.  
One guy playing well can motivate 
the rest of team to play better.”

Next up for UCSD is the Cal 
State San Marcos Invitational on 
Feb. 8 and Feb. 9. Last season, the 
Tritons finished in eighth place at 
the competiton.

And at 6,750 yards, there is an 
excellent opportunity for the team 
to go low, Okasaki said.

“[It is realistic that] we can shoot 
around par on this course,” he said.  
“In our practice round there last 
week, I shot 67, so it’s definitely 
doable. Weather permitting, the 
course isn’t too difficult, but the 
recent rain will make it tougher, as 
the course doesn’t drain well and will 
play sloppy.”

MEN’S BASKETBALL — UCSD was 
eager to get back on track this week-
end after losing five games in a row.

They did just that on Saturday, 

Feb. 6, beating Cal State Los Angeles 
83-77 at RIMAC Arena. 

Senior guard Jordan Lawley, the 
conference’s leading scorer, shoul-
dered the scoring load as usual for 
the Tritons, posting a game-high 29 
points. Lawley shot nine-for-18 from 
the field, and scored 19 of his points 
in the second half.

Sophomore center Christian 
Hatch also stepped up for the strug-
gling Tritons, delivering a career-high 
23 points. He broke his personal best 
of 16 while tallying 11 rebounds for 

his third double-double of the season.
UCSD got off to a hot start, sink-

ing 10 of its first 15 shots. Hatch and 
Lawley combined to score 15 points 
in the game’s first 10 minutes, helping 
the Tritons build a 25-14 lead.

The Golden Eagles closed to with-
in four at 30-26 on a layup with 5:12 
left in the period, but UCSD closed 
the half on an 11-4 run to take a 41-30 
lead into the locker room. 

After the break, UCSD saw its 
lead pushed back up to 12 following 
a pair of Acevedo three-pointers, but 

the Golden Eagles came roaring back, 
closing to within five at 79-74 with 
1:38 left to play.

After both teams failed to 
score, Los Angeles senior guard 
Dwayne Jones got a steal in the 
UCSD backcourt, resulting in 
a trip to the line for junior 
forward Mark Dorsey, where 
he could have cut the deficit to 
two with 36 seconds remaining. 

Fortunately for the Tritons, 

UCSD snapped a five-
game losing streak 
against Cal State
Los Angeles.

MEN’S GOLF — The Tritons opened 
their 2010 season on Feb. 2 with a 
third-place finish at the San Diego 
Intercollegiate. The team shot a 
two-round total of 629, finishing 

38 strokes behind 
winner Univeristy 
of San Diego and 
host Point Loma 
Nazarene.

UCSD finished 
ten strokes ahead 
of San Diego State’s 
B squad, and 28 
strokes in front 
of Cal State San 
Marcos.

Although USD is 
ranked an impressive 
No. 42 in Division-I 
— according to 
Golfweek — Triton 
senior captain Keith 
Okasaki said that fact 
doesn’t excuse his 
team’s disappointing 
performance.

“We really just 
didn’t play that well,” 
he said. “It had been 
a long time since we 
played in a team for-
mat and had a rough 

tournament. I just tell the guys to 
keep their heads up, and don’t worry 
about it.”

Senior Raj Samra led the Tritons 
with rounds of 78-76 for a 10-over-
par 154, and a ninth-place finish 
overall. 

Freshman Anubhav Rastogi came 
in three strokes behind Samra in his 
first tournament as a Triton. The 
frehsman matched Samra’s low score 
in the first round for UCSD.  

Okasaki finished in a tie for 16th 
after a pair of 80s. UCSD’s No. 1 
golfer said he had expected more of 
himself, and was hoping to start the 
spring season strong after finishes 
of T-8 and T-26 closed out the fall 
schedule.

In the first tournament of the new 
year, the rust from the long layoff was 
apparent to Okasaki, who admitted 
to having some trouble with his iron-
play. Despite practicing throughout 
the winter break in his hometown, 
he said his swing and rhythm just 
weren’t there during the San Diego 

A POINTED SWEEP

The UCSD fencing team hosted UC Irvine and Caltech in a three-way meet on Saturday, Feb. 6. The Tritons scored comprehensive victories over their opponents. On the men’s side, the sabre team went 17-1 on the 
day, beating CalTech 9-0 and UC Irvine 8-1. On the women’s side, the epee team was undefeated against the Anteaters. Next up for UCSD will be a five-team tournament in Irvine, followed by regionals in March.

After a three-month 
hiatus, UCSD placed 
third in a field of 
five at the San Diego

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL — 
Coming into the final stretch of 
the season, the Tritons are firing 
on all cylinders.

The eighth-ranked women’s 
basketball team was victorious 
against Cal State Dominguez 
Hills on Feb. 4 and 
Cal State Los Angeles 
on Feb. 6, winning 
both games by a 
combined 52 points. 
UCSD beat Cal State 
Dominguez Hills 
83-57 and rolled 
past Cal State Los 
Angeles 75-43 for 
the team’s 18th and 
19th wins of the sea-
son.

“We are finally 
all on the same page 
on both defense 
and offense,” senior 
guard Annette Ilg 
said. “We are able 
to run our sets very 
effectively now, and 
the chemistry on the team just 
seemed to click this week.”

Playing against Dominguez 
Hills on Thursday, sopho-
more guard Daisy Feder had a 
career-high 19 points, while fel-
low sophomore guard Chelsea 
Carlisle scored 17 points. Ilg 
contributed 14 points and three 
steals to the Triton effort. 

The Tritons had a tough 
night at the free-throw line, 
shooting only 47 percent in 
the first half, which allowed 
Dominguez Hills to stay close.

However, defensive pressure 
forced the Toros into first-half 

turnovers that the 
Tritons converted 
into 19 points — 
with 10 points 
coming on the fast 
break.

The Toros found 
themselves in even 
deeper trouble when 
Neka Mixon, their 
leading scorer and 
rebounder, picked 
up three early fouls 
— confined to the 
bench for most of 
the first half. The 
Tritons took full 
advantage of this 
weak spot, holding a 
formidable 17-point 
lead at halftime. 

UCSD continued dominat-
ing after the break, extending 
its lead by as much as 32 points. 
Triton bench players contrib-
uted a season-high 42 points. 

Later, on Saturday, the 
Tritons squared off against Cal 
State Los Angeles in a Women’s
