LASERS AND FUSION 
by Alan N8s8Oll 

Staff Writer 
"Water, water everywhere, and 

not a drop to burn ... " 
A virtually inexhaustible fuel 

supply, no long lasting radioactive 
products, practically no chance of 
accidental radiation releaae . . . 
fusi(lfBOunds 1lke Ii nUclear energy 
panacea. Recall, however, tbat 
efficient fusion under laboratory 
conditions Is not yet attainable. 
This article discusses one current 
approach : laaer fusion. 

Before diacussing the laser 
approach itlelf, one mlllt consider

just what Is meant by "efficient 
fusion." Fuston is efficient if it 
releases more energy than was 
required to initiate the reactions. 
To date no one bas been able to 
break even. Perhaps the promising 
laser scheme will work. 

The PrInciple 
The basic principle of laser 

fusion sounds simple: a 
microsphere containing heavy 
hydrogen is the target for 
ultrahigh-power lasers. The 
energy of the lasers, absorbed by 
the fuel pellet, both beats and 
compresses the deuteriwn. ('nle 
compression, or implosion, of the 
fuel in a microsphere Is actually a 
subtle physical phenomenon. 
UCSD physicist Keith Brueckner 
perfonned many of the early 
theoretical calculations con-
cerning implosion.) The deuterium 
undergoes fUsion and releues 
energy as diacusaed in the lut 
article in this series (TT, Oct. 5).1f 
enough deuterium nuclei fuse, 
more energy Is released than the 
laser pulse delivered. 

'lbe Experlmeats 
Major experiments are being 

conducted at the two government 
labs administered by UC: 
Lawrence Livermore Laboratory 
and Los Alamos Scientific 
Laboratory. Both laboratories are 
fwxled by the lovenunent throuIh 
the EnerlY Researcb and 
Development Administration 
(ERDA). Livermore receives 
more than ball of the available 
funcla for ita efforts. 

The ...... ..eeI -' Uvermonare

which can deliver several 
terawatts of power (1 TW = 101 2 
W. ). The two big efforts at 
Uvennore are called Argus and 
Shiva. A third project, Nova, is still 
mostly blueprints. Argus, a two 
beam experiment, showed suf-
ficient promise to prompt the 
building of Shiva. 

SUva Is a huge, 20 beam ex-
periment, housed in several large 
buildings at Livennore. Shiva uses 
the most powerful fusion lasers in 
the world. The first shots should be 
fired sometime this month. 
Initially, the goal Is to demonstrate 
"scientific feasibility," meaning 
that about one percent of the beam 
energy can be returned from the 
fusiGn of the pellet. The goal for 
breakeven is 1983. 

Meanwhile, back in Los Alamos, 
experiments are being conducted 
with carbon dioxide lasers. Early 
studies predicted that CO2 lasers 
could not be effective enough due 
to the longer wavelength of the 
light emitted. Last spring, 
however, a two beam system 
demonstrated much higher ef-
fectiveness than was expect«:d. 

An eight beam system, planned 
for completion next spring, will try 
to improve on the promise of the 
two beam experiment. Also, on 
Aug. 16 a groundbreaking was held 
in Los Alamos for a $55 million 
laser facility called Antares. The 
Antares facility Is intended to 
achieve breakeven in 1982. Antares 
will focus 12 beams on the target 
spheres, delivering 200 TW in a 
pulse lasting about 250 billionths of 
a second. 

1bePoUdcs 
While many researchers share 

optimism for the prospects of laser 
fusion, the Carter administration 
in WashinttGn has not been as 
receptive to fusion research as the 
previous administration. Carter's 
budget proposal for this year 
slashed $20 million from the fun-
ding level of the previous year. 
AlthoUlh . Congress has in part 
restored funds, the amount spent 
does not seem to refiect the 
potential benefits. It would seem 
that more, rather than leu, should 
be allocated for such important 
reaearcb.

Board of Education candidates 
disagree on style, not issues 

by Mark StacDer 
Phil Halfaker and John Adler, 

who are vying to represent District 
B on the San Diego Board of 
Education, don't really disagree on 
a lot of issues. 

They both, for example, are 
against mandatory busing to 
achieve racial integration. But 
they both believe that if San 
Diego's voluntary integration plan 
does not measure up to the ex-
pectations of Judge Louis Welsh -
who ordered the desegregation of 
area schools - then more man-
datory measures will be required. 

They both also believe that a 
ceiling of 36 students in an 
elementary classroom is not low 
enough to achieve maximwn 
educational results. And they both 
agree that a person's private 
sexual preferences should not be a 
factor in deciding whether that 
person should teach in the schools. 

Matters of Style 
Where Halfaker, the 52-year old 

incumbent, and Adler, the 29-year 
old attorney, disagree, is more on 
matters of style. San Diego voters, 
during the Nov. 8 general 
municipal elections, will decide 
which style they prefer. 

Halfaker, a university professor, 
has been characterized during his 
tenure on the board as a low-key 
individual, not given to quick 
judgements on issues or flam-
boyant oration. 

He has on occasion served as a 
swing vote on issues that have 

polarized board members. For 
instance, his was the vote that 
broke the deadlock in favor of 
amnesty for teachers who walked 
off their jobs in the recent city 
teachers'strike. 

Adler, on the other hand, says his 
major campaign issue is to 
establish the board as a leader in 
the community. He says the board 
in recent years has settled into a 
role as a reactive force that has not 
taken the initiative on such issues 
as school integration and labor 
relations . 

The two candidates also disagree 
on several issues. The major point 
of contention between the two 
appears to be the board's handling 
of the recent teachers' strike. 

Board Lost Control 
"During -the strike and the 

bargaining process (between the 
city and the San Diego Teacher's 
Association) before the strike the 
board lost control of its own 
negotiating position," said Adler. 
"Board members had no idea of 
the bad faith bargaining positions 
Jts negotiating staff took in the 
city's name. 

"This led directly to the strike, 
because if the board had been in 
control the bad faith bargaining on 
the part of the city would never 
have happened." 

Halfaker disagreed, saying the 
SOT A did not follow the process set 
out in the state collective 
bargaining act. 

"The teachers went out on strike 

Professor offers comprehensiOn hints 

only three weeks after negotiations 
began, and ignored several steps 
set down in the collective 
bargaining act. During the past 
summer, we had very successful 
negotiations, but they took nine 
weeks," Halfaker said. 

The two candidates also differ in 
their responses to claims by the 
University of California that state 
schools are not doing a good job 
preparing students for college. 

"Complex Issue" 
" It's a very complex issue," said 

Halfaker. "Many students who in 
the past would never have con-
sidered going on to a four-year 
college are now doing so, whether 
they're really prepared or not. And 
the universities, which have 
lowered theif admissions stan-
dards, are practically taking all 
comers now. 

" I think our schools are 
producing the same number of 
high quality students as in the past, 
but we're also producing just as 
many lower quality students, who 
are now being accepted in the 
universities. " 

Adler, however, agrees with 
UC's claims. 

He sees a need for a proficiency 
test on basic skills as a 
prerequisite to high school 
graduation, and also favors more 
emphasis on college prep courses 
for college-bound students.

Speed reading courses debunked 
by Reed Alpert 

AssocIate News EdItor 
Ever thought of going to one .... 

of those speed reading courses 
and learning to whip through 
the Exorcist in an hour? 

. According to psychology 
professor at UCSD you may 
learn to turn the pages. faster 
but as for increased com-
prehension, don't count on it. 
. " It's very easy to increase 
your speed, " says Jay 
McClelland, assistant professor 
of psychology, " but what 's 
important is to pick up the 
material from the page faster. " 
Increased speed of com-
prehension is the goal. 

McClelland bas been doing 
research with both slow and fast 
readers, trying to develop a 
model as to why people read at 
different speeds. 

He cited one experiment in 
which graduates of speed 
reading courses were given a 
reading comprehension test. It 
was found that the graduates 
did no better than people 
without the course. 

McOelland has also done 
researeh testing the com-
prehension of speed reading 
class graduates against un-
dergraduates. Very fast 
readers from the class (1500 
words per minlte) were acorinl 
about ten percent correct on the 
test whereas the averBIe un-
dersrad .. te scores about sixty 
percent. 

"The re8lOlll for this aren't 
100 percent clear to me," said 
McOelland, "I suspect that 
part of what's loins on is that 

they (the speed reading cour-
ses) ask questions on their 
comprehension tests that you 
are likely to be able to get right 
whether you read the material 
or not. " 

Follow the fiDgers 
Many speed reading classes 

first teach the student to follow

Following those finger. too

McClelland , UCSD 
Psychology professor. 
the motion of their finger across 
the page. Later larger motions 
of the hand are used to scan the 
entire page. "The notion that 
you are able to read by smooth 
motions of your eye is totally off 
the wall," commented 
McClelland. "I believe they are 
teaching you how to skim 
through the material. '!be 
course is an exercise in self-
deception. " 

What makes one penon a 
better reader than another? 

"I don't have a full answer to 
that question," responded 
Mc<lelland. He said that there 
are many components and 

processes that determine a 
person's speed. Ia addition, all 
of the factors interact with each 
other. One very important 
factor, according to 
McOelland, is "the ability to 
assess infonnation quickly in 
long-tenn memory from print. " 

By being able to assess the 
meaning of the individual words 
quicker one can expend more 
"cognitive energy" in gathering 
the essence of the material. 

"But I don't think that all of 
the detenninants of reading 
speed are cognitive," added 
McClelland. He cited the 
reader's intent in reading the 
material as such a factor. 

Get a feeling for reading 
McClelland did offer a few 

ideas on how to increase 
comprehension and speed. 
"Evelyn Wood is right in saying 
you should really get a feeling 
for what you're reading before 
you read it." If you're going to 
read the newspaper you may 
only want to skim through it, 
looking for important stories 
you may want to 'f'e8d more 
carefully. If, however, you have 
to criticize what you're reading 
you should take more time to go 
over it, " He also stressed being 
familiar with the tnaterial. 
"Take the time to look at the 
first ar.d last paragraphs and 
get an i:lea for what is going to 
be said. And, of course, prac-
tice." 

"My basic idea is that there 
are differenccli between people 
that are due to bo much 
someone has read and perhaps 
also conatituUonal differences." I

All the Republican entries have a

Brown made speeches for the

the good visuals for the TV market

Tom Quinn, a fonner Brown

1977) that "_"they ran their 
campaign aimed at television 
because that is where most voters 
get their political impressions and 
it can be controUed better than the

Where does America's image of 
democratic pluralism account for 
a participation based upon image 
and impression, rather than a 
knowledge of the facts involved in 
the issues? If media is a key factor 
in the selection of leadership, who 
controis this source of image-

WMa be reIigDecl Jut May, 
UCSD waterpolo coacb Gary 
Becker cMt't apeak too IUcbb' of 
bla yet ....,..,.., IIICC8IIIOr. Beeker 
laid "Tbey'll (the pbYRcal 
eduea&lon department) probably 
briItIln somebody who Ian't wIlIinI 
to put In the time." 

Wbertv .. you are, Gary Becker, 
lint year coach Ruu Hafferkamp 
would like to ba~ a few words with 
you. 

Sporting a team with nine fre~ 
men on a tbirteea man roster, 
UCSD is beading towardllita beat 
season ever. Now 9-6, the Trito .. 
crushed Ambusador College, 14-6 
last Thursday aDd breezed put 
oubnanned Loyola, 13-2 Saturday 
afternoon. 

NearSll .... ' 
UC San Dlego tallied five first 

period goals on just six shots en 
route their win over Loyola in the 
Natatorium. 

The Tritons came very close to 
scoring tbeir fint shutout of the 
season, a feat almost unheard of in 
waterpolo. Loyola got their first 
goal two minutes into tbe third 
period as goalie Bob Alei w. 
pulled olt of position. The only 
otber Loyola goal came in the 
fourth perioeJ when the ball carried 
past Alei on the strength of the 
water c..-rent. 

Dan Eby and freshman Jbn Senz 
led UCSD with three goala apiece 
with Tom Jorgensen and Frank 

. Ebeleacb adding a pair. 
Evea Game of 80ffa 

Loyola attempted 21 shots on 
Alei while the Tritons tried 23 on 
Loyola goaUe Jim Duffy, bit most 
of the visitor's attempts were 
either weak or blocked by Alel. 

Early in th~ aecond period, 
Loyola had a two man advartage 
but failed to score; when UCSD'. 

. offense sp~.red in tbe third 
period, the vialtors fnlm Los 
Angeles could not nina the 
momentum to their side. 

Several time. during the game, 
Loyola looked as if they were golnl 
to make a lUI at UCSD, bit they 
lost tbe ball on fouls or violations of 
the 3$ second clock. 

Haflerbmp Upeet 
Sltting on a . comfortable ~ 

halftime margin, Haffertamp 
seemed upset and expressed IU 
discontent with his leam's play. 
His squad'. offense again failed 
until midway through the third 
period when David Harry taWed, 
followed by goala by Ebel and 
Jorgensen to pad the lead to 1-1. By 
then it was elemertary. But the 
Tritons scored five more times in 
the final eight minutes to turn the 
game Into a rolt.

Ego 'ball6oning' session I 

,Mclaughlin becomes an audience to IT interviewer 
by Ted N ... Barb 
CaalrJlnltlllrll!'.tUfllr 

John Mc~qblln, formerly 
Mahaviahnu JolIn, and conaidered 
by some to be the moat lmportut 
jaZZ gultarllt in the laat twenty 
years, is dancIDC a Jic in a dreaalnI 
room in the upper IeYeI 01 the 
uom gym while beamlDl a amile 
of dlsquieUng tranqulllty. A 
cassette plays a pen:uasloD solo 
from a concert be'. just completed 
with his most recent of banda, the 
all-Indian, an-acouatlc Sbutl. 
McLaughlin spina around, leather 
bag draped over ODe arm, and 
faces a mldcDe-aged Indian man 
who's hia multiopercuaaionlat, the 
one who's on tape. Mclaughlin's 
smile become. large enough to 
plant a garden in as he verbally 
improvises a cbukka-chlkka 
rhythm into his ear. The man, who 
knows only a few words of Engllah, 
laughs, ~es IUs head, and 
retl!fllS a varUition of the beat, as 
though correcting the guitarlat 
about the metre. The former 
Mahavishnu proffers a good-
natured shrug, snaps off the 
cassette machine, and then dwells 
over a buffet of food handily 
supplied by the Campus Program 
Board. After perusing the meat 
and che... slices and the whole 
wheat bread, he sits on a table and 
lights a cigarette, a DuMaurler. 

Three of \IS have been allowed 
into the dressing room inner 
sanctum - myseU, a repreae.n-
tative from KSDT and a man from 
Columbia records; and we ner-
viously hover on the perlpbery 01. 
others wbo gather around 
McLaugblin, Including a tasael-
haired road manager who loob 
wise in the way. of tbe street, other 
members of hkli and others who 

, seem to bavemore right to be there 
than I feel I have at the moment. 
We're introduced by the roed 
member and bandabakes are 
exchanged. When my turn comes, I 
fumble over my words and wind up 
repeating my ~e three time. to 
the guitarist, 

"Tim?" asks McLaughlin, 
"Uhh, Ted," I manage, voice 

hushed in an appropriate respect. 
"Tom?" 
"Ted., ," 
"Ted?" 
"Yes." 
'Ted . Yes. Hello." 

McLaughlln's expression during 
that bit of wordball was one 01 
earnest inquisition, bit once my 
name had gotten rig!1t, he Dashed 
another of those transported 
smiles and took llgbt drags off biB 
smoke. I backed off a bit, feeling 
like a vegetarian in a steak house, 
mindful of McLaugbllna' status as 

a reapected mn.lcian and a con-
start winner of intemational jazz 
polls. WbIIe the Columbia rep 
Informed him that his new album 
was to be reIea.d the following 
week, I remembered that my 
harmonica was in my panta pocket 
and was in the proceas of making a 
fresh Impreuion in my thlgb. Not 
wanting to see the words 
"HOHNER" emblazoned in my 
skin, I removed it to replace it in 
my coat pocket. There was then a 
break in the people who were 
crowding around; McLaughllnsaw 
the harp. His eyes allgbted again 
with the gleam of inquiry. 

"You play harp," beaslted. I was 
already nervo.. enoU8h to have 
sent. all the SAC missiles towards 
Moscow had they been at my 
disposal, b~ tbe prospect of 
talking to Mcl,aughlln about 
music, l.e., tonality, lIC8~ chord 
structures, hannonic coristructlon 
and other technicalities that I 
understand intuitively but lack the 
neo-mathmalical knowledge to 
come on like One Who Knows, 
made me doubly so. Worse, the 
prospect of playing for him stirred 
faint rumblings 01 nausea. An 
existential moment. 

"Yeah," I finally managed, "I 
play Cblcago blues style, like 
Butterfield, Uttle Walter ... " My 
words seemed to fall onto the floor 
in an undlstlnguisbed clwnp. But 
Mclaughlin kept cool. 

"Why don't . you play 
something," be said matter of 
factly , I m~d a baU-bearted 
phrase of reticence and put the 
bannonica to my Ups. 

A word salad of doubts raced 
through my head. What to play? 
What if I fuck up? What am I doing 
bere? What if I've been overrating 
my own playlDg all tbeae years and 
Jotm McLaugblin, arguably the 
beat jazz gultariat in the world, 
simply yaWOl and politely asks me 
to stop? What if,., 

But wben' the going pta tough, 
the toUih get going, so I swallow 
my doubtl and proceed tbroqb 
aome twelve bar blues. I try for 
different solos I've learned over 
the years. "Drlftln' and Driftin'" 
by Butterfield, "Serves You RIght 
to Suffer" by J. Gells and others. I 
miss notes, play an inappropriate 
fast lick, fuck up a chord. I stop 
and then shrug,. making a move to 
put tbe harmonica away. 
Mclaughlin shake. hla head. 
"Don't atop now. Keep going ... " 
I'm not as paranoid thla time. 

"Allrlght," I say, '''Walking 
Through the Park'" by Muddy 
Waters .• ," I put the harp to my 
lips again and proceed througb a

"Dadad Deeee Dumda-da, bodda 
bo bodda, dum dee drum do, 
wahbhbdo do wang dab doodle ... " 
and so on tbrough a dozen 
variations until I sense I'm 
wearing out my welcome. 
Everybody in the room had balted 
what tbey'd been doing and were 
now standing in a haif-circle 
around me, clapping tbeir handa in 
tandem to my riffs. Mclaughlin 
himseU laughed, bollared "Yeah," 
"All right," and " Incredible" at 
various times. I think he liked it, 
from appearances. I put the 
harmonica to its final resting place 
while Mclaughlin shakes my hand 
again, saying it was "very nice." 
He asks me if! play professionally, 
and I give a spaced inventory of the 
bands l've played in. I was in the 
Twilight Zone. 

Five minutes later, tbere's a 
series of questions aimed at 

~cLaughlln . Suddenly I remember 
my duties as journalist. Interview. 
I've burned up much of my time 
already with my egomania, and 
suddenly I have to fonnalize some 
questionS. The Colwnbia rep, 
who'd been standing off to one side 
politely while I ate up his chance to 
rap with McLaughlin, asks the first 
question. 

"What do you think of Jerry 
Garcia's guitar playing?" His 
voice has "Dead freak" written all 
over it. McLaugblin passes and 
tries to frame a correct answer. He 
really doesn't want to say. 

"I haven't heard enoUl!h 01 his

material to foRD an opinion ... I'm 
reaDy quite unfamiliar with his 
work ... " The Columbia rep gently 
prods him for some response. 
McLaugblln baUway capitulates. 

"I feel as thougb I'm walting for 
something to happen ... " 

"How about Allan Holdsworth," 
I ask, following the flow oJ. 
questioning, altering it towards 
someone of Mclaughlin's 
technical calibre. 

"Allan would be better if be 
played less. He's very fast and 
very clean, but he plays too much, 
really, too many notes without 
enought emphasis on ideas. Speed 
is fine , but not in and of itself. You 
get through practicing, acquiring 
technique, and technique should be 
used only in the expression of 
something personal, like an idea, 
or something else . . . What you 
don't play is just as important as 
what you put in ... " 

"Did Columbia think you were 
crazy when you decided to unplug 

and form an an-acoustic band?" I 
ask. 

UN ot really. A couple of 
executives bslked, bit they have 
some good people there. They've 
allowed me to develop as I've 
needed. I had no problem, really, 
in talking them Into it." 

"Why did you switch to acoustic 
from electric guitar? 

"For myself, I prefer playing 
acoustically. You can be more 
subtle, subtle in ways you can't be 
if you're plugged into an amp. I've 
experimented with electric guitar 
and have gone through its 
possibilities, but now I want a 
sound that's powerful without 
being over-powering. In the con-
text of ShaW, I'm able to in-
corporate ideas tbat would get lost 
at full '<olume ... " 

At this point, the road manager 
annOWlces witb utmost tact that 
the band must drive back up to Los 
Angeles for an engagement the

If you want to be up-front about your good taste in stereo components, see your AKAI dealer. 

And when you do, you'll get your "Great Performances" iron-on decal absolutely free. 

While you're there, be sure to see the entire line of fine AKAI stereo components: reel-to-reel 
and cassette tape decks, receivers, speakers, integrated amps and tuners. And whether you 're a 

first-time buyer or lookmg to upgrade, there's an AKAI component to fit your budget. (So you 
won't have to sell your. books to be able to afford to have the best.) 

No matter which you choose, with AKAI, you never heard it so 
good. And with your free iron-on, you'll feel like giving one of li fe's AKAI 

great performances too. \bu !'\rever Hearn h So Good.
