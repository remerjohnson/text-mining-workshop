Intern Funds Approved 
By John Hondros 

Associate News EdUor 
The Relistration Fee Com-

mittee voted in favor of in-
cluding $2,400 more to the Reg 
Fee Internship Program at a 
meeting Wednesday . The 
motion to add two more interns 
to the program, which will 
make a total 'of six, passed with 
nine members in favor and one 
abstention. 

Last year's budget request 
was for four interns, but after 
the interviewing of the ap-
plicants was done, it was 
suggested to the committee by 
the Intern Coordinator Mary 
Anne Rodgers that having 
six interns would give the 
committee some flexibility. 

"The committee will be 
pleased at having hired six 
interns," said Rodgers. "The 
coverage and input these 
people can give from the 
student perspective will be 
important in the decision-
making process." 

The new Reg Fee interns are: 
Peter Berghammer, Lauren 
Crutcher, Jan Dooley, Susan 
Garcia, Denise LaVaut and 
Marc Stolman. 

The committee postponed 
voting on the areas to be 
covered by the interns until 
next week's meeting. "It's 
important we make it clear that 
it (the Internship Program) is 
not a witch hunt. We must let 
them (the units which will be 
researched) know that it's an 
information gathering system 
in order to alleviate the fear 
that people are being inves-
tigated," said Rodgers. 

Reg Fee Committee Chair 
Kenzie Nicoll announced at the 
meeting that the student 
referendum scheduled to occur 
in two weeks has been re-
scheduled for the third week of 
winter quarter, because 
"there's not enough infor-
mation to get it going." The 
referendum will cover the 
issues of Day Care and Recrea-

tion Facility funding, as well as 
making revisions in the AS 
Constitution. The cost for the 
referendum will be $2 ,000 , 
which will be "picked up by 
those who have issues on the 
ballot," said Nicoll. He believes 
the referendum will benefit the 
committee in determining how 
funds should be allocated to the 
Day Care center and Rec 
facility. 

In other business: 
- Rick Whitehill, a con-

sultant to the Reg Fee Com-
mittee , presented a fiscal 
report. Whitehill showed the 
damaging effects of Prop. 13 
and inflation on the University. ' 
Presently, the committee is in a 
comfortable financial state, but 
Whitehill warned the group not 
to take this smugly. 

- Bonnie Higley was elected 
Reg Fee Committee Vice 
Chair. Her function will be to 
serve in the absence of the 
chair.

Eliminate FCC 
Van Deerlin 

Talks to UCSD Students 
By Jeff Beresford-Howe 

Auociate New. Edi&or 
When LyndoJl Johnson had to 

make an appointment on the 
Federal Communications Com-
mission, he surprised a lot of 
people and named a Repub-
lican as the chair. 

He did this, San Diego 
Congressman Lionel Van 
Deerlin (D-San Diego) told a 
Communications-Political 
Science seminar on campus 
Wednesday, because "certain 
broadcast properties were 
protected, which happened to 
be owned by the President of 
the United States." 

Van Deerlin is chairman of 
the House Communications 
subcommittee that is currently 
working on the House version of 
an extensive rewrite of the 1934 
Federal Communications Act. 
He spoke with Bob Jacobson, a 
UCLA lecturer currently seek-
ing his Communications doc-
torate, and Rudy Britz, a cable 
TV expert now affiliated with 
the West German government. 

The draft proposal of the 
revision would eliminate the 
FCC entirely, and allow only 
such regulation as is made 
necessary by difficulties in 
what Van Deerlin hopes will 
become a "free market" in the 
television and radio industries. 

Van Deerlin told the after-
noon audience in HSS 1330 that 
he thought electronic com-
munications media were over-
burdened by the political biases 
of the FCC and court inter-
pretations of the original, 1934 
FCC guidelines . Johnson 's 
appointment falls into the 
" political " category, Van 
Deerlin said. 

" I don't want seven FCC 
Commissioners deciding the 
nation's communications pol-
icy. For example, radio and TV 
reporters don't have the same 
freedom as a newspaper re-
porter with pad and pencil. 
They always have the long ann 
of government reaching over 
their shoulder to countennand 
them." 

Van Deerlin also contended 
that the FCC regulations in 
radio were originally designed 
to deal with 534 radio stations 
and are now inadequate for the 
approximately 8,000 stations 
that now exist. His solution is to 
"immediately deregulate radio 
and start towards that way in 
television. " 

The free market, Van Deer-
lin says, will allow for greater 
diversity and growth in tele-
vision, once the people have 
been given the right to choose 
freely . Though he conceded 
that FCC regulations were once 
needed, he says that because of 
the expanding use of teoh-
nology in televis ion, com-
munity groups have a much 
greater potential for access. 

Jacobson and Van Deerlin 
differed amicably throughout 
the seminar. Jacobson con-
tended that the proposed 
changes in the act were a 
" rewrite to quash the incipient 
activism of the FCC," and 
charged that even with regu-
lation , there has been an 
"absolute failure to deal with 
equity of access to communica-
tions facilities of our times." 

Seventy-five percent of all 
television stations in Cali-
fornia, he said, are owned by

High Court Rules: 
No Traffic Warrant Arrests 

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -
The routine detention of tramc 
offenders for warrant cbeckl 
by police without relard to the 
exiltence of luspicioUI cir-
cumstances is "constitution-
ally unrealOnable," the Cali-
fornia Supreme Court laid 
yelterday. 

The 4-3 decision by Justice 
Stanley Mosk said the intrusion 
from sueb detentions "is not 
outwel,hed by the ,overn-
ment's asserted interests in 
conductin& the warrant 
checks." 

It reversed the Marin County 
Superior Court conviction of 
Larry Sanchez MeGaughran of 
San Francisco for burglary. 

A Larkspur policeman stop-
ped MeGaughran as he drove 
the wrong way on a one-way 
street. A passen,er was seen to 
have leaned over the back seat 
and move an object on the 
floorboard. 

The officer made a check for 
outstanding arrest warrants 
and found there was an Ala-
meda County burglary warrant 

for the defendant. The Initial 
cbect took about 10 minutes, 
verification another 25 minutes 
and MeGaUlhran wal arrested 
on the burtlary warrant. 

On reachin, the station, 
police checked the car and 
uDder the seat found a citizens 
band radio which had been 
stolen from a locked car a mile 
from the arrest scene. 

The court said a brief deten-
tion for a warrant check 
following a valid traffic stop is 
justifiable when the officer can 
reasonably suspect there may 
be an outstanding arrest 
warrant for the driver. 

"To pennit routine police 
detentions of all persons 
stopped for a traffic violation in 
the hope of apprehending the 
relatively few scofflaws among 
them would he an unreasonable 
imposition on the motoring 
public," declared the court, in 
noting less than two percent of 
the licensed California drivers 
deliberately ignore traUic 
citations. 

Pope to Alter Curia? 
VATICAN CITY (AP) -

Pope John Paul II on Thursday 
deferred picking his top aides. 
indicating a possible shake-up 
in the Vatican's central ad-
ministration, the Curia. 

A Vatican spokesman said 
there probably would be no 
word on the appointments this 
week. It was the first time in 
recent transitions that 

the chief department heads 
have not been continued or 
promptly renamed to office. 

The new pope obviously " is 
going to put his own strong 
stamp" on his administration, 
rather than "just giving 
automatic, blanket approval" 
to the previous office-holders, 
said the Rev . Vincent O'Keefe, 
second-in-command of the 
Jesuit Order. 

High Level Visits to 
Soviet Union Now Fine 

WASHINGTON (AP) - The 
Carter administration bas 
quietly lifted a moratorium on 
most hiah level visill to the 
Soviet Union, imposed to 
protest actlonl by MOlcow 
a,alnlt dissidents and U.S. 
bUlinelsmen and reporters, 
adminiatration officials said 
yesterday. 

The officials, who alked not 
to he identified, said the new 
policy reflects a chanled Soviet 
attitude, which has belped 
improve the atmosphere he-
tween the two countries since 
last summer when Moscow 
charted two American news-
men with slandering the gov-
emment and accused a U.S. 
businessman of currency 
violations. 

The administration never 
publicly used the word "mora-
torium" to describe the policy, 
but said official visits to 
Moscow not involving security 
issues would he "deferred on a 
case-by-case basis." Officials 
said privately, however. that 
"moratorinm·' was an ac-
curate description. 

50>< .. " ",0<1 bv 'he UJS 

Officials said there are 
several trips now in the works 
which would not have been 
made last summer. SurleOD 
General Julius Richmond, the 
top U.S . healtb official, is 
scheduled to go to Moscow 
early next week for a meeting 
of the joint U.S.-Soviet com-
mittee on health. 

More si,nificant is the 
planned vilit in early Decem-
her by Treasury Secretary W. 
Michael Blumenthal for meet-
ings on trade relationl between 
the two countries. 

The improved climate coin-
cides with si,nificant progress 
toward a new arms limitation 
agreement. Secretary of State 
Cyrus R. Vance and Soviet 
Foreign Minister Andrei Gro-
myko will meet in Moscow in a 
few days for what they hope will 
be the climactic round of a six-
year effort to limit the strategic 
anns race. 

The go-ahead given for the 
trips by Richmond and Blu-
menthal follows a series of 
indications from Moscow that It 
is anxious not to let relations

with Washington deteriorate 
too far . 

Since the moratorium was 
imposed, the Soviet Union bas 
reduced the sentences handed 
down to some dissidents, halted 
court action a,ainst the two 
American reporters and al-
lowed the u.s. businessman 
charted with currency viola-
tions to leave the country. 

Some officials believe Mos-
cow's conciliatory attitude may 
he related to a recent reduction 
in anti-Soviet rhetoric from 
Washington. 

National security advisor 
Zbigniew Brzezinski , one of 
Moscow's harshest critics in 
the administration, has had 
little to say publicly about the 
Soviet Union since a vitriolic 
attack on Moscow's policies on 
national television last May. 

Since then , Secretary of 
State Cyrus Vance, known for 
his advocacy of low-key di-
plomacy, has served as the 
chief administration spokes-
man for Soviet policy.

Gene Diseases' 
UC Researchers Believe 
Arthritis Is Gene Linked 

By Erie IIarpeU 
SYlf Writer 

A group of UCSD Researcb-
en, includinl medical student 
Rodney Bad8er. are studyinl 
genetic influence in the de-
velopment of arthritis and 
other bereditary diseases. 

Ochroootic arthritis, a rare 
fonn of arthritis whicb causes 
joint damage and is charac-
terized by discoloration of the 
joint cartilage, Is being ex-
amined in the laboratory of J . 
Edwin SeegmiUer, M.D. Re-
searcben feel that this fonn of 
arthritis Is caUJed by an Inborn 
metaboUc error. Their conclu-
sion is based on carefully 
conducted family studIea which 
Indicate that the dlaease Is 
genetically transmitted. 

SeeJllliUer, Director of the 
Human Biochemical Genetics 
program at UCSD Scbool of 
Medicine and veteran arthritis 
researcber, began studying 
genetic variation as related to 
chemical balance in the body as 
early as 1953. A theory pI"&-
posed by Sir Archibald Garrod 
in 1908, prompted Seegmiller's 
experimentation. Studies have 
shown that bomogentistic acid, 
a disease associated material 
that accumulates in the blood 
stream, was the result of 
genetically determined mis-
sing enzymes . This study 
supports Garrod's theory on the 
genetic relation to chemical 
imbalance associated diseases. 

Rodney Badger, UCSD medi-

cal student working out of 
SeegmiUer's laboratory, later 
found that bol1lOlentistic acid 
depoeits In buman cartilage 
cells, and inhibits IJ'Owth. With 
tbiJ new information in the field 
of disease prevention, Badaer 
is now exploring values of 
certain drugs in prevention of 
this process. 

Additionally, Dr. SeegmiUer, 
Badger and ~researcbers are 
currently investigating how 
genes affect the immune 
system (the immune system Is 
the body's natural ability to 
figbt off infection and diaease) . 
Abnormalities of the immune 
system are frequently 88-
sociated with several forms of 
arthritis, in addition to some 
forms of diabetes, multiple 
sclerosis and other bereditary 
diseases. Research of this type 
is directed toward eventual 
early detection of genetic 
diseases, as the entire spec-
trum of human genes are 
present in the body at birth. 
Defects discovered in the 
immune system would be 
evidence of future disease. 

Funds Cor research were 
provided by the Kroc Founda-
tion of Santa Ynez, California. 
Established by the San Diego 
millionaire ownerorthe Padres 
and MacDonald's corporation, 
the foundation attempts to 
"further medical science 
through research in the areas of 
arthritis, diabetes and multiple 
sclerosis. " 

TV Violence 
(Cont. from page Z) 
mood throughout the week and 
showed a high level oC hurtCul 
behavior. We found that those 
who saw seven nights oC violent 
television exhibited hurtful 
behavior Significantly more 
often than those who watched 
only a night or two of it." 

Albert Bandura of Stanford 
Univenity's School of Com-
munications. has conducted 
extensive laboratory research 
over the years on communi-
cations effects research. His 
findings show that exposure to 
television violence can have at 
least four different effects on 
viewers: (1) it teaches ag-
gressive styles of conduct, (2) it 
alters restraints over ag-
gressive behavior, (3) it 
desensitises and habituates 
people to violence and (4) it 
shapes people's timages oC 

reality upon which they base 
many of their actions." 

These are but a sampling of 
the research having taken 
place in this field of study. I did 
not go into the various method-
ologies used in the research as 
this paper was intended as an 
overview rather than an in-
depth analysis. However, 
based upon the research 
conducted thus far I feel that a 
causal relationship clearly 
exists between violence view-
ing and aggressive bebavior. 
We can only hope that more 
research wiU be undertaken 
and that upon the basis of 
qualified and conclusive re-
search, the programming of the 
national networks will come to 
reflect a more responsible 
attitude in tenns oC program 
content.

Arizona 
By Joe GoeI.z 

S&aIf Writer 
The water polo team will trY 

to maintain its four-game 
winning streak 7: 30 tonight at 
the natatorium when the 
Tritons clash against Pac 10 
power Arizona. 

The Wildcats of Arizona, in 
their fifth season of water polo 
competition, qualified for the 
NCAA national tournament the 
last three yean, finishing fifth 
in both 1976 and 1m. After Cour 
losses to perennial NCAA 
finalists Stanford and Berke-
ley, the Cats areo't eligible for 
the tourney tbiJ year. 

Arizona, 10-7 on the season, is 
heavily favored over the 7-3 
Tritons. They topped UCLA H, 
and drowned Claremont 20-7 
earlier this year. In four 
meetings with UCSD, the 
Wildcats have yet to bow to the 
Tritons. 

San Diego coach Russ Haf-
ferkamp is strongly encour-
aging students to attend the 
only night game of the year. 
"The players need encourage-
ment. We want people to show 
up, kick back in the stands with 
a six-pack and be vocal. The 
game will end about the time 
the night life begins around 
here." 

The fans may be treated to a 
thriller if UCSD can slow down

Poloists Here ' 
the quick Arizona squad. "The 
key to being close," said the 
UCSD coach, " is to control the 
tempo of the game and elim-
inate turnovers. Arizona has a 
very, very fast team, so we wiU 
have to dictate the pace of the 
game." 

Anned with a steadily im-
proving defense , and the 
reliable scoring arms of Kai 
Loedel, Dan Eby, Dan Crane 
and the rest of the starting team 
(eight players scored in last 
weekend's slate of games), the 
Tritons pose a threat to the 
Visiting Pac 10 team. 

Though his team's defensive 
play is not always as consistent 
as he would like it to be , 
Hafferkamp seems pleased 
with their attack. "We have 
balanced scoring now. First, 
we try to run the fast break and 
see what we get. Second, we try 
to run a pick. Picks take 1000/0 
concentration, though, aod the 
guys haven' t got it down yet. 
Third, we try to put the ball in 

the hole (to the man directly in 
fron~ of the goal) and draw an 
ejection." 

UCSD will be seeing a dif-
ferent Arizona team tban their 
other opponents have before. 
Coach Rick LaRose shuffled 
the line-up ' after the Cats ' 
playoff hopes were shattered 
last weekend. "Freshmen and 
the younger players who will be 
back next season will SC4l most 
of the action Cor the rest 01 ~tte 
season," he said. With a roster 
of Junior College All-Amer-
icans and other talented 
underclassmen, however, the 
team will hardly be dented by 
the loss of their four seniors. 

Recognizing Arizona's su-
perior depth. the Tritons will -
not just be thinking victory 
Friday night. " It's going to be a 
tough game. " said HaUer-
kamp. " Our attitude into the 
game is: Let's go out and have 
some Cun, play our game the 
best way we know how, and sit 
back and watch the outcome."

UCSD to 
Select an 
1M Team 

(San Diego) - The bigest 
event to hit the collele campa 
in recent yean will be back 
again during the Im-79 school 
year. and Budweiser will be

round-of-Bud or six-pack 
"pitch-in" and tug-of-war. 

Local competition is hosted 
by Coast Distributing Co .. San 
Diego. area distributor of 
Budweiser and other Anheuser-
Busch. Inc., beers. Competition 
will be held at San Diego State 
on Saturday, Oct. 28. 

Last year the competition 
was known as the Budweiser 
College Super Stars Competi-
tion and the University ofldaho 
bested teams from more than 
175 colleges and universities 
from around the country to take 
the national championship at 
the finals at Busch Gardens in 
TamPa .. FI. 

Campus-level winners ad-
vance to state and reeional 
competition and a representa-
tive from each region will 
travel to the Budweiser College

Record Prices Spinnin"g Out 
By C.u. MaJen 

Well folU. they're aUt again. 
Waroer Brothers is proud to 
present tbe first 'l.tI list 
record. Steve Martin's Wild 
and Crazy G.y. without so 
much sa a simple "ex-
cuuuulsrseeee meeee!" (I'm 
sorry. they made me do it). . 

Wby the biper price? Pack-
aging expe ..... says Warner 
Brothers. Clap-trap. says this 

writer. Comedy records are 
usually the cheapest kind to 
make. No overdubbing. no 
session men; jUlt a microphone 
and a tape recorder . And 
profits. 

At this point. the reasonable 
reader may stop. rub his eyes 
and wonder. "why all this 
righteous indignation over a 
piddling comedy record. when 
there are far greater illUel to 

frustrate onelflf with?" My 
answer is twofOld. First. I have 
enough righteous indignation in 
my blood for every cause down 
to the senseless slaulhter of 
amoeba in Oxnard. And if you 
think Warner Brothers is going 
to limit the price increaae to 
that particular record (as they 
have. so far. claimed). college 
admisaioDl procedures should 
be drastically revamped. 

Next time you are at your 
local record mart. stroll down 
the aisle and pick up Boston's 
new one Don't Look Back. Take 
a good look at the edge of the 
record. You will find the artist. 
the title of the album. and a 
whole lot of little numbers and 
letters that make sense only to 
those at the store. The first 
letter of that number will be an 
"F." Now pick up a record that 

has been around awhile. You' ll 
find some other letter. I will 
now let you in to the secret of 
the mighty "F." The F tells the 
record retailer how much to 
charge for the record. " F" is a 
new letter. Beginning to get the 
picture? I knew yoil would . 

Right now you will find " F " s 
on six records . guaranteed 
sellers all: Billy Joel. Chicago. 
Santana. Heart. Ted Nugent 
and Boston. In a matter of 
weeks. the new releases of the 
above artists will be raised to 
$8 .98 . The prices will most 
likely be booted up at the 
beginning of the holiday rush. 
when the unoriginal among us 
cannot think of anything better 
to buy our friends . This year, 
you will have a choice: pay the 
higher prices or avoid the 
above-named artists . Far be it 
from me to suggest which of the 
above options one should take 
(objectivity of the press. and all 
that pap) . but to help spur your 
thinking along, let me quote

wrlliOI bia early plays, the 
success of bis attacks was 
pract1caUy auured, retardleu 
of aucb mattera .. uaivenal 
truth, bumanistic aad artistic 
concern, etc. Mr. Albee, 
however, baa iDaiated that a 
play 1ft ... be Jud8ed (by critics, 
at least) 011 ia. fonn, rather 
than ia. coateat. 

OD tbia .core, [tbinktbatn.e 
Zeo sa., ia one of bia flDer 
early works. Tbis, Albee's 
second play, is a study of 
contrutiDI charadera wblcb 
takes place in New York's 
Central Park. Unlike some 
later worts, the cbaracten 
bere are presented equivo-
cally; one doesn't let tbe 
feelinl that Albee ia teUiaI us 
IOrnetbiq about the American 
Way Of Life, but rather ex-
ploriDI wbat could well have 
been an actual event. As sucb, 
the pro.reuion of the dialope 
ia leu frantic, more evenly 
paced than that of lOme later 
plays, wbile moviDi quickly 
eooulb to bold the viewer's 
interest in compensation for the 
paucity of physical movement. 

Tile American Dream is 
more stilted, more formulized 
in the style of, most obviously, 
Ionesco's "absurdist' · plays. 
Here we find Albee moving 
toward Who's Afraid of Vir-
ginia Woolf, toward a critical, 
polemical depiction of The 
American Family. There is a 
lot of repetition , a lot of 
uxoriousness, and the climax is 
simply a less horrible version of 
the final act of Vlrtinia Woolf. 

Wbat is really gqing to be 
interesting is to see bow Albee 
himself directs the plays now, 
over fifteen years after he 
wrote them . The cast was 
cbosen by Mr. Albee, who won' t 
himself be pusent at the 
perfonnance (he demanded an 
additional $3,000 for his pre-
sence) . Though the price is 
IOmewhat bigh, [ think the 
perfonnance will prove worth-
wbile. Tennessee Williams has 
called Albee "the only great 
playwright we've ever bad in 
America ." More modestly, 
Albee expressed the hope that 
the plays "transcend the 
personal and the private, and 
(have) something to do with the 
anguish of us all." 

Records 
(Coal. from Pate 7) 
ever been before. They've had 
an 11% increase in profits over 
the past year. This fiscal 
quarter, net income exceeded 
48 million dollars. 141.8 million 
so far this year. 

Far be it from me to sUllest 
any kind of collective action, 
leat I be accused of beiDI a 
Marxiat, or a Libertarian, or 
any other one of those people. 
But let me say this. If Columbia 
found that the new bigber price 
cut substantially into sales, 
they'd back orf. There are no 
starvlnl record executives, but 
many starviDJ Itudema. And 
tboae starving students account 
for the vast majority of record 
sales. 

You are not powerless. All 
you bave to do is put a UtUe of 
that famous UCSD apathy to 
work - in the record stores. 
Shine on the hilher priced 
records - don't allow the 
precedent to be set. If all record 
prices 10 up, it Is only because 
the consumer let them.

adamantly, Flew aalts, "wby

that you're putting them away 
indicates that you're not reaUy 
prepared to have them back in 
society ? You become com-
mitted to keeping these people

beiDlltiUed left and rlPt," said 
Flew. 

The freedom to cboole death 
sa aD alternative to proloqed 
illDe8I, or eutbanuia. it one of 
Flew'. particular iIlterests. As 
cbairman of tbe Voluntary 
Euthanasia Society in Britain, 
be it outapoken in biB support of 
voluntary death. According to 
Flew the right to die continues 
to be an Important isue because 
" the proportion of rather 
horrible and protracted death 
is in fact tendin, to ,0 up. " 

Flew reports that "a product 

of the advaDCel of mecUclne iI 
what tM docton bave IUC-
ceeded in doIq: Itoppilll a lot 
'of quiet ItilJiDI dl ..... " He 
ueed tbe example of pDeu-

frieDd," 10 named becau.e 
"quick paeumoa1a saved him 
from a protracted and often 
very poor old ate with tradu-
.Ily everytbiDI breaklDI 
down." More and more people 
are llviqloqer 1lve1 becauae 
of medical advances, but the 
quality of the added years 
Merna to be decliDiJll, said 
Flew. A leqtbened exiatence iI 
not desirable if one iI aufferlDJ 
a slow death. 

The effect of tecbnololY has 
been twofold, accordin. to 
Flew . One is tbat "beroic 
lifesaving measures keep alive 
a lot of miserable wrecks that 
would never have been kept 
alive before the doctors be-
came so cleaver." The second 
is that " the advances insure 
that most of us will live to die or 

father borrible tbiDlI,aWI'\)D." 
Altboulb one is able to live for a 
.reater leqtb of time, the 
death that follows will not be 
quick aDd utile, but rather, 
a.onIIID.ly proloD.ed. Tbe 
Euthanasia Society took a poll 
ill 'Brltain aDd found that there 
it a 4 to 1 majority in favor of 
the rilbt to die. SaYI Flew, "the 
queat10D of euthanaaia iI DOt 
.otlll to fade away completely 
until people bave, one way or 
another, a ri.bt to die." 

Flew it a viattiDi Philosophy

educated at St. John's CoUeae, 
In Oxford, recelvlDi several 
distlnctioDl. He has written
