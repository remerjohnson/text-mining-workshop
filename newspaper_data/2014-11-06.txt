Founder of UCSD Department 
of Anthropology Melford Spiro 
died at age 94 on Oct. 18. Spiro 
was known for his contributions 
to “the study of unconscious 
motivation in religion and social 
life,” according to an Oct. 30 UCSD 
News Center article. Spiro came to 
UCSD in 1968, recruited the first six 
anthropology professors and taught 
the department’s graduating class 
in 1969. Two of those professors — 
David Jordan and Shirley Strum — 
still are at UCSD. The cause of death 
was not reported.

According to the News Center 
article, Spiro was born in 1920 in 

Ohio and earned degrees from 
the University of Minnesota and 
Northwestern University. He taught 
at four universities prior to teaching 
at UCSD: Washington University, 
University of Connecticut, 
University of Washington and 
University of Chicago.

Spiro published papers that, 
according to the Hartford Institute 
for Religion Research’s online 
encyclopedia page, “stress the need 
to consider both psychoanalytic 
and cultural forces in attempting 
to understand human behavior.” 
He conducted research in locations 
such as Micronesia, Burma and 
Israel, working among a wide 
variety of people including North 
American Ojibwa Indians and 
kibbutz residents. 

He was appointed as the first 
President Chair at UCSD in 1982 
and retired as a professor emeritus 
in 1990. According to the News 
Center article, he served as the 
president for both the Society for 
Psychological Anthropology and the 
American Ethnological Society and 
“published hundreds of articles and 
more than a dozen books.”

Among the many awards that 
Spiro won throughout his career 
— including two Guggenheim 
fellowships and the Einstein 
fellowship at the Israel Academy 
of Sciences — he was awarded the 
Excellence in Teaching Award from 
the Chancellor’s Associates at UCSD.

   UCSD’s LGBT Resource Center 
held a transgender symposium on 
Nov. 4 to begin its yearlong celebration 
of the center’s 15-year anniversary. 
The symposium focused on the 
experiences of transgender people of 
color in America’s prison system as 
well as the strategic movement to bring 
about its abolition.

The symposium, entitled “We 
Cannot Live Without Our Lives: A 
Conversation on Anti-Blackness, Trans 
Resistance and Prison Abolition,” 
hosted a panel of four formerly 
incarcerated black transgender women 
and organizers: CeCe McDonald, 
Reina Gossett, Janetta Johnson 
and Miss Major. Eric A. Stanley, a 
President’s Postdoctoral Fellow in 
Communication and Critical Gender 
Studies at UCSD, moderated the panel. 

During the panel, the four panelists 
went into detail about their traumatic 
experiences during the unjust nature of 
their incarcerations. The panelists also 
emphasized that although the LGBT 
community currently gets more media 
coverage, it does not necessarily mean 
that circumstances are improving for 
members of that community.

Furthermore, the panelists 
expressed worry that the mainstream 
LGBT causes are leading the public to 
pay less attention toward the causes 
that they have been fighting for 
generations.

“I think the ways in which so much 
of mainstream LGBT organizing is 
now focused on marriage, military and 
hate crimes legislation actually push 
out lots of really important, already 
marginalized voices, like people in 
prison,” Stanley said. “And because 
trans women of color who are currently 
or formerly incarcerated are among the 
most marginalized in the community, 
it’s really important that we focus our 
collective energy in supporting them.”

The panelists also went on to 
characterize their movement to abolish 
the current prison system, as well as to 
distinguish it from any movements to 
merely reform the system.

“The prisons are not broken, but 
they’re working exactly how they’re 
supposed to be working so reform is 
not enough,” Stanley said. “We actually 
need a totally different way of being in 
a world.” 

The program as a whole, 
according to the program flyer, had 
three primary objectives: to allow 
the narratives of transgender black 
women to guide the conversation, 
to provide space for participants to 
learn about the intersections of race, 
class, gender and sexuality through 
narrative and inquiry and to address 
the climate for transgender women at 
UCSD and beyond.

ELECTION   2014

San Diego County Supervisor Greg Cox publicly announced his support for the Scripps Institute of Oceanography’s earthquake monitoring projects 
at a news conference on Oct. 28. Cox’s announce-
ment came as a response to a recent budget cut for 
the Scripps-operated ANZA Seismic Network by the 
United States Geological Survey. 

During the news conference, Cox noted how essen-
tial this time could be in preparing San Diego for an 
earthquake. To show support for Scripps’ current proj-
ects, Cox encouraged the San Diego County Board of 
Supervisors to vote to continue searching for the neces-
sary funding.

While the cost of maintaining this system of seismic 
sensors, located throughout San Diego, Riverside and 
the Imperial Counties, has risen over the last several 
years, the financial backing provided by the USGS has 
usually remained level before being cut this year. 

The ANZA network, which utilizes state-of-the-art 
broadband and strong motion technology, consists of 29 
stations that straddle the San Jacinto and Rose Canyon 
fault zones. Within their region of detection is also 
the San Andreas Fault, one of the most active seismic 
regions in the state. Each station continuously monitors 
surrounding ground activity and transmits this infor-
mation back to Scripps within two seconds real time.  

According ANZA’s webpage, the organization has 
provided information that has helped assess seismic 
hazard magnitudes in Southern California since its 

establishment in 1982. While the city of San Diego is 
not at as densely populated in hazardous areas like Los 
Angeles, officials believe being unprepared for an earth-
quake could have massive implications for both public 
safety and the city’s economy.

“San Diego is the second largest city in the state,” Dr. 
Frank Vernon, principal investigator of the Broadband 
Seismic Data Collection Center at Scripps, said in an 
interview with the UCSD Guardian. “And its economy 
would be greatly affected by an earthquake.” 

With the network fully operational, an approxi-
mately 20-second warning will be available before an 
earthquake detected by Scripps’ sensors reaches San 
Diego. However, not all 29 stations will remain open 
without the proper expenditure.

Luis Monteagudo, director of communications for 
Cox, reiterated the importance of the sensors for those 
living in San Diego.

“These censors are critically important to public 
notification systems,” Monteagudo told the Guardian. 
“In the past, these censors have been funded by the 
USGS, but when this funding stopped, we reached out 
because of our long-standing relationship with Scripps 
and the good work that they’re doing. It’s important 
that we protect the resources we have in the interest of 
public safety.”

▶ UC San Diego Wins Awards for 
Environmental Sustainability

UC San Diego Wins Award for 
Environmental Sustainability

On Sunday, the San Diego County 
Air Pollution Control District and the 
Industrial Environmental Association 
awarded its Blue Sky Leadership 
Award to UCSD for its efforts in reduc-
ing negative effects caused by global 
climate change.

“This is quite a feat for a facil-
ity of our size and complexity and 
something of which we are extremely 
proud,” Gary MacPherson, director 
of Environmental Health and Safety, 
said at a press conference. “Over the 
past nine years, we have not received 
a single notice of violation from the 
district.” 

The university was specifically 
lauded for its electric power generation 
technologies, which account for 92 

percent of electricity used each year on 
campus. These constructs help reduce 
the emission of greenhouse gases from 
the school. The bulk of the efficiency 
comes from the Combined Heat and 
Cogeneration Plant, though the school 
boasts the largest methane-to-electric-
ity fuel cell of any college campus as 
well. The campus has also installed six 
electric car charge stations in order to 
advocate a shift from petrol-dependent 
automobiles. 

Vice Chancellor for Resource 
Management and Planning Gary C. 
Matthews spoke for the university 
and expressed his excitement for the 
recognition.

“This award demonstrates our 
continued dedication to both main-
taining a clean environment and uti-
lizing the most advanced technol-
ogy to ensure a sustainable future,” 
Matthews said.

▶ Human Stem Cell Clinical Trials on 
UCSD’s Horizon

UCSD is appropriating $275 mil-
lion to start clinical trials of human 
stem cells, which can develop into a 
plethora of other cell types and has 
vast — as well as controversial — 
implications for the future of science 
and biology. 

$100 million of the funding orig-
inates from philanthropist Denny 
Sanford, who has helped provide the 
capital for the school’s new Sanford 
Stem Cell Clinical Center. The facil-
ity is poised to hire 20 to 25 stu-
dent employees for research, and 
students will be able to be selected 
for drug trials, though this pros-
pect will likely be stalled for some 
time to come. UC San Diego Health 
System CEO Paul Viviano had some 
reservations regarding the Center’s 
timeline.

“We’re still in the research stage,” 
he said in an interview. “This $275 
million effort is meant to accelerate 
research, pushing things toward clini-
cal trials in one of the most promising 
areas of science.”

Larry Goldstein, director of the 
UCSD Stem Cell Program, has con-
tributed much to the field. He used 
stem cells to cultivate functioning 
Alzheimer’s neurons, which will be 
central in efforts to develop and 
screen potential medications. He is 
developing similar treatments for 
Lou Gehrig’s disease and spinal 
injuries. Goldstein recognizes the 
grant as a huge leap forward for 
stem cell research.

“We need to do experiments on 
people,” he said. “We’re not just big 
mice ... This center will set up the 
pipeline, set up the methods, help us 
recruit patients and begin testing.”

“More than anything, we wanted 
to highlight the experiences of trans 
women of color,” director of the 
LGBT Resource Center Dr. Shaun 
Travers said.

One of the panelists and Activist 
Fellow at Barnard College’s Center 
for Research on Women Reina 
Gossett told the UCSD Guardian 
that her personal goal was to form 
connections both with people at the 
forefront of the movement and those 

who are looking to learn more about 
how they can get involved.

“I wanted to connect with the really 
brilliant legacies of Miss Major, Janetta 
and Cece, as well as with an audience 
that I think is both hungry for, already 
engaged in and strongly supportive 
of abolition and supportive of black 
trans women being at the center of a 
movement to create self-determination 
and trans liberation,” Gossett said.

To continue celebrating its 15th year 
at UCSD, Travers told the Guardian 
that the LGBT Resource Center 

is going to hold an alumni brunch 
during Winter Quarter 2015 that will 
include all of their LGBT alumni, the 
former LGBT Resource Center interns 
and former students leaders that were 
involved in any of the LGBT and 
people of color organizations.

Additionally, Chancellor Pradeep 
Khosla is going to hold an LGBT 
leadership reception during Spring 
Quarter 2015.

In the wake of an imminent 
UC-wide tuition increase, a new 
national survey has found that the 
majority of millennial women worry 
about their financial futures due to the 
impact of student debt.

The survey, conducted by lifestyle 
website UChic, asked approximately 
500 women if they felt the financial 
constraints of higher education would 
keep them from achieving their profes-
sional dreams. Of the respondents, 67 
percent said yes. 

Additionally, 52 percent of respon-
dents reported accumulating up to 
$14,999 in debt from non-tuition relat-
ed expenses like textbooks.

Christie Garton, founder of UChic, 
believes today’s students are likely to 
end up underemployed, and as a result, 

have an even more difficult time pay-
ing off their loans.

“When you go into college, there is 
the expectation that when you gradu-
ate, you’ll be able to get a great job 
in the field that you want to go into. 
But that’s just not the case anymore,” 
Garton said.

Instead, Garton explained, students 
take whatever jobs they can to begin 
paying back their loans, leading to a 
trend of underemployment and affect-
ing these students’ earning potential in 
the future. 

Garton also believes that the grow-
ing financial burden will have a long-
term effect as students shy away from 
pricy, top-tier schools in favor of more 
economical options. 

“Today more than ever, with stu-
dent debt at an average of $33,000, 
students are going to start [to] take a 
hard look at the more affordable uni-
versities,” Garton said. “What it really 

comes down to is an individual choice, 
like choosing a school where alumni 
are making the most money from the 
major you want to pursue.”

The UC system has been under a 
tuition freeze for the last three years, 
in part due to a financial boost 
from Proposition 30 in 2012. But 
UC Regents Board member George 
Kieffer recently told the UCSD 
Guardian that a tuition increase of 4 
to 5 percent is likely to take effect in 
the 2015-16 school year. 

“It’s difficult to foresee a healthy 
future without building tuition in 
some way,” Kieffer said. “I think we 
should be prepared to face a sense of 
reality that tuition cannot be frozen 
forever and in the end that’s not 
sustainable [or] a solution.”

How to Stay 
at UCSD 
Forever and
Ever and Ever

As the economy continues to 
tank, jobs for college graduates 
remain scarce. But why worry about 
post-graduation job searching 
when you can simply extend your 
college career by a few quarters? 
With Friday’s launch of the Winter 
Quarter Schedule of Classes, it’s 
important that you plan your 
schedule so that you make little or 
no progress toward your degree.

Your financial aid and parents’ 
conditional love depends on your 
full-time enrollment in courses.  
While the easiest way to ensure a 
prolonged undergraduate stay is to 
simply not take any classes, you’ll 
need to give your parents and your 
loan service the impression of a 
student who is trying. Below, we’ve 
outlined the simplest ways to take 
classes that look like you’re making 
progress without any actual progress.
If you’re an upperclassman, you’re 
probably looking at fulfilling more 
upper-division requirements for your 
major. To avoid making progress in 
your department, sign up for lower-
division classes only.

Try to diversify — enroll in no 
more than one class from any single 
discipline and do your best to avoid 
introductory classes that may be too 
passable. Instead, pick lower division 
classes that expect some prior 
coursework in the field.

There are two advantages to 
signing up for these types of classes, 
the first being that these classes 
won’t count for any upper-division 
requirements for your college or 
major. Even if they accidentally 
fulfill general education requisites, 
they’re still probably unnecessary 
now that Sixth, Eleanor Roosevelt 
and Revelle all loosened their GEs. 
The other advantage to these classes 
is that they’re designed to be difficult 
and boring for you. This means 
you’ll end up incredibly stressed 
out and needing to drop the course 
— an easy way to avoid on-time 
graduation.

If you’re a freshman or 
sophomore, you’re constantly in 
danger of making progress toward 
your degree. To make sure this 
doesn’t happen, put yourself on as 
many waitlists as possible, usually in 
major requirement classes that only 
seniors can find seats in. By the time 
your sign-up slot rolls around, these 
classes will be filled and you’ll be 
riding on a waitlist.

It’s important to remember that 
signing up for classes will happen 
in two passes. This change was 
originally instituted to help you 
forget to sign up for classes the first 
time. Tritonlink won’t let you register 
for a waitlist-only section during 
First Pass, so you’ll want to definitely 
make sure you wait until Second 
Pass to start selecting courses. 
Better yet, stay ahead of the game by 
missing your First Pass deadline and 
signing up for classes at the very last 
second.

With regard to your general 
education requirements, most 
colleges will allow you to double 
up classes you take for a major or 
minor with your GEs, meaning 
one class can count for both. This 
is a dastardly ruse to try to help 
your graduation plans move along. 
Fight back by insisting on taking 
one class per requirement with no 
doubling up. At that rate, you’re 
guaranteed to prolong the Pomp and 
Circumstance.

New Parking Structure Doesn’t Benefit Undergrads

By December 2015, UCSD might have another parking structure on campus, but 
to our great disappointment, 
transportation changes involve no 
new student-designated parking 
spots in these plans.

University affiliates received 
an email last week regarding the 
construction of a new parking 
structure in East Campus that will 
be built atop Lot P756 near the 
medical neighborhood in La Jolla. 
Because P756 had been an “A” 
lot strictly for patients, staff and 
visitors, undergraduate students 
will be largely unaffected by these 
changes. In any case, only graduate 
students and staff who frequent 
the medical centers will see some 
differences in their routine as 
the “B” spaces in Lot P760 will 
be moved to Lot P783, which is 
located near the Mesa apartments 
and graduate student housing.

While it’s nice to see that the 
UCSD Transportation Services 
is doing something to address 
the difficulty of parking on our 

campus for some affiliates of the 
university, what we really need is 
an announcement of a new parking 
structure or parking changes that 
will actually affect undergraduate 
students at this school. With the 
number of undergraduate students 
at UCSD consistently on the rise, 
our campus needs to seriously 
consider creating another structure 
that will ensure students can park 
their vehicles to get to class and 
on-campus jobs.

Because the new parking 
structure will have little effect on 
undergraduate students, it is only 
fair that the new East Campus 
Parking Structure — projected to 
cost $25 million — strays from 
increasing student fees to foot its 
bill. The new structure is intended 
to be self-sufficient through 
patient and visitor fees, a model 
Transportation Services should 
also consider when planning future 
parking structures. 

In a previous editorial, we 
suggested revoking free parking 
on nights and weekends at current 

parking structures in order to gain 
additional revenue from visitors, 
rather than increasing already steep 
parking permit costs. Additionally, 
we proposed the idea of building 
a parking structure on top of one 
of the existing flat lots on campus, 
like the one in Muir College. 

Our campus has a terrible track 
record of quietly painting over “B” 
spaces in order to create more “A” 
spaces, as well as over “S” spaces 
to compensate for those lost “B” 
spaces in both the Hopkins and 
Pangea Parking Structures. With 
this new addition of 1,200 faculty 
and visitor spots in East Campus, 
we believe that reinstating “S” 
spots at central lots on campus 
is a reasonable compromise until 
funds can be allocated for the 
construction of a new structure 
with student-designated parking 
spots.

The changes are a solid effort 
on the part of the administration, 
but there is still a long road ahead 
to fix the parking situation on this 
campus.

Though the 2014 midterm elections — and all those annoying political advertisements bombarding our HuluPlus subscriptions — are finally over, the real trouble for students 
has yet to come.

With the Senate and House takeover by Republicans Tuesday 
night comes a bizarre new era of unity in Congress. This unity, 
though, is not strong enough to override a presidential veto — 
meaning legislation for student loan rate changes, federal funding 
to universities and the minimum wage all hang in a limbo 
between the adversarial president and the newly reunited House 
of Representatives and Senate. In short, not much will change in 
Washington unless the seemingly now lame-duck President Obama 
and a GOP-led Congress can learn to work together.

As you snort sarcastically into your lunch at the impossible 
situation described, we turn to our state government in the hopes of 
finding unity that can benefit students. Again, all statewide elected 
positions will be held by Democrats. And even with eight state 
legislature races yet to be projected as the UCSD Guardian goes 
to press, Democrats in the state hold sizable majorities — notably, 
though, not sizable enough to raise taxes without Republican votes. 
A unified executive and legislature in the largest state must be good 

for the nation’s largest universities systems, right?
Unfortunately, this happy-go-lucky Democratic Party in 

California cannot stop the inevitable tuition increase. A member of 
the UC Board of Regents strongly hinted at inevitable increases in 
an interview with the Guardian last week — this, while A.S. Vice 
President External Affairs Allyson Osorio leads a charge of students 
protesting the increases and calling for tuition rollbacks.

The juice has run out in Sacramento, and the past four years of 
tuition freezes will likely end before the freshman class of 2016 even 
receives its acceptance letters. Worse, though, is that one round of 
increases probably won’t even cut it for University of California 
students. Newly re-elected Gov. Jerry Brown’s magic from the 
2012 Proposition 30 (in the form of taxes for the very wealthy and 
modest sales tax boosts) will begin to sunset into oblivion next 
year, costing millions for the state’s treasury. Brown’s attention, as 
he begins his fourth run as governor, will likely be drawn to other 
crises in California, like the rapidly depleting supply of state water.

Students have no true hero in Sacramento or Washington, D.C. 
— at least not one with a chance to make real change. The Guardian 
opted last week to neither endorse incumbent 52nd District 
Representative Scott Peters nor his Republican opponent Carl 



DeMaio for a number of reasons. 
Geographically, the 52nd district is 
bound by La Jolla Village Drive to 
the south and Interstate Highway 5 
to the east, meaning virtually no part 
of the UCSD campus that services 
undergraduate students falls into the 
Peters/DeMaio district.

Ideologically, neither candidate 
has much of a chance to exercise 
his agenda in Washington; Peters’ 
Democratic vote is muted by the 
ruling GOP already, and DeMaio’s 
progressive agenda would fall victim 
to the party lines drawn by the 
established leadership. Finally, both 
candidates employed such despicable 
campaign antics that we had little 

interest in seeing either elected. It 
is a tight race, with fewer than 800 
votes differential by press time.

Representative Darrell Issa, 
whose 49th district stretches from 
the La Jolla Playhouse north to 
Camp Pendleton, is no friend to 
UCSD students either. Issa refused 
to work toward meaningful student 
loan reform in 2013 and hasn’t 
really shown interest in UCSD 
since a student was erroneously 
locked in a Drug Enforcement 
Administration cell for five days in 
2012. Issa handily won re-election 
and will “represent” UCSD until at 
least 2016.

We did see some victories in 
California, however, that will at 
least marginally support UC and 

California State University campuses. 
Proposition 47 will free up prison 
space and, thus, state money by 
handing small-time offenders lighter 
sentences. Propositions 1 and 2 — 
which both passed — will help our 
state find new water sources and will 
save money for the state when there’s 
a little extra in the budget. Neither 
of these can singlehandedly stave off 
tuition hikes but are still small steps 
in the right direction.

So gone will be the mass 
voter registration booths, the 
campaigning, most anything 
labeled “Peters” or “DeMaio” and 
this much hyped but little changing 
election. But lingering, for students 
at least, are the stirrings of evil and 
expensive changes to come.

LETTER  TO  THE  EDITOR

Dear Editor,
I have been very concerned 

about the plastic to-go plates used 
at my dining hall, Pines in Muir 
College (ahh, the irony) and at 
other dining halls on campus. I 
am sure that these plastic plates 
are relatively cheap for Housing, 
Dining and Hospitality; however, 
due to the food residue on them, 
they are often thought to be not 
recyclable by students and end up 
in landfills. 

Some students who do not 
actually need the take-out 
dishes take them anyway for the 

convenience of simply throwing 
them away rather than putting 
them on the cleaning table.  

While I do not consider myself 
an environmentalist, I believe, like 
many others, that it would be in 
our interest to use biodegradable 
plastic plates instead, since unlike 
paper alternatives, they do not 
fall apart and are, as the name 
suggests, biodegradable. Also, I do 
not believe that this will impose 
a significant burden on HDH 
because they are able to generate 
so much revenue from the insanely 
high prices of dining hall food 
(hooray for monopolies).

- Richard de Thorpe 
Freshman, Muir College

HDH Should Use 
Biodegradable Plates

San Diego Asian Film Festival

The San Diego Asian Film Festival will be screening at several locations around the city from Nov. 6 through Nov. 15, including at UCSD in Atkin-
son Hall and the Visual Arts Presentation Lab. With dozens of films made in a multitude of genres, styles and lengths, SDAFF has plenty to offer. 

Here are some of the more anticipated features. Illustrations by Elyse Yang and Irene Luu. 

“The Kingdom of Dreams and Madness”

Witches and wizards, spirits in bathhouses, Catbuses and raccoon-like creatures obsessed 
with umbrellas — it’s hard to believe that one mind has created numerous stories with such 
varied characters over the past three decades. But this kind of diversity and quirkiness is com-
pletely within the creative realm of animator and storyteller genius Hayao Miyazaki. Fans of 
the Japanese filmmaker from all across the globe mourned when the great artist announced 

Screens in UltraStar Mission Valley on Nov. 8 at 4:55 p.m. and on Nov. 8 at 8:05 p.m.
“Mary Is Happy, Mary Is Happy”

Screens in UltraStar Mission Valley on Nov. 12 at 8:05 p.m.

If you attempt to string together the last several hundred tweets in your Twitter history, 
you might only expect to end up with a strange jumble of random thoughts. Yet the inge-
nious “Mary is Happy, Mary is Happy” manages to unite 410 actual tweets made by Thai 
teenager Mary Malony, resulting in a cleverly quirky experimental dramedy. 

Initially the film seems exactly as you’d expect: a tangled assortment of apparently unre-

“Reptilia in Suburbia”

“Reptilia in Suburbia” is a heterogeneous mixture of pretty much everything you can think 
of. Mad scientists claiming to be sexless? Sure. A precocious teenager confronting a self-
proclaimed Satanist? Yes, indeed. Charity dances for missing pets? Certainly. The unrelenting 
parade of freaks has no end; even stranger things, like love and tenderness, are present in this 
one-of-a-kind Philippine film.

“Man from Reno”

Lettuce and a matchbook with a phone number: two unlikely objects to be left behind in a 
suitcase. They’re still not enough to prompt the average person to bat an eye, but for mystery 
novelist Aki Akahori (Ayako Fujitani), who has just fled to San Francisco amidst her book 
series’ latest press tour in Japan, a clue is hard to pass on. Meanwhile, Sheriff Paul Del Moral 
(Pepe Serna) is following the footsteps of a man he accidentally hit with his car and finds Aki

san  diego  beer
  week 2014

Friday, nov. 7   t
hrough  sunday

, nov. 16

In the past 20 years, many American cities have turned into brewing cen-ters of the country — Denver, Boston, Chicago and San Francisco are just some examples. However, among these famous-for-beer locations, only San 
Diego received a status of the “Craft Beer Capital of America.”

Such a title is not only a great honor for the city but also a great responsibility. 
Local breweries do their best to prove that the beer market can offer more than 
Bud Light. One way to enlighten those who are unfamiliar with craft beer culture 
is San Diego’s annual Beer Week, a sort of Comic Con for beer geeks. This year’s 
Beer Week will take place in multiple locations across San Diego County from 
Friday, Nov. 7 through Sunday, Nov. 16.

The most important events of Beer Week are the 12th Annual San Diego Brewers 
Guild Festival and the Beer Garden. The Brewer’s Guild festival — a two-day event 
at the Port Pavilion on Broadway Pier in downtown San Diego — will offer samples 
from more than 50 San Diego County breweries. Tickets may seem pricy — they run 
at about $40 to $55 and are available both online and at the event— but for this fee, you 
can sample over 100 beers and will receive a commemorative cup. For $25, you can also 
act as a designated driver, which, while an unpopular choice, still gets you unlimited food 
samples and nonalcoholic drinks.

The second event, the Beer Garden, brings back the old European tradition of outdoor 
beer drinking. This event was created to celebrate the unity of good beer and delicious 
food. Festivities will take place in the beautiful Arroyo Terrace of the Lodge at Torrey Pines, 
a 10-minute car ride from UCSD (you can also take a bus there — nobody wants to be a 
designated driver during Beer Week). Despite its convenient location, this grown-up event has 
truly “grown-up” prices — $75 for unlimited beer, food pairing samples and a commemorative 
taster glass.  

         Don’t let the prices discourage you from attending Beer Week — the festival has 
so much more to offer. Different breweries from all over the county also organize their own 
events to help spread the culture they cherish. Eureka!, an American restaurant at Westfield 
Shoppingtown UTC, offers beer tasting for just $20. If you’re down for some culinary experiments, 
give the Benchmark Brewing Company a try. Located on Fairmont Avenue in Grantville, their 
year-round tasting room will surprise visitors with a deliciously peculiar combination of donuts, 
coffee and stout.

Beer Week is a unique event created for both beer connoisseurs and novices. Whether you are 
familiar with the San Diego brewery scene or not, Beer Week masterminds will guide you through 
the process of choosing the perfect beer for you. Stouts, pale ales, porters — figure out which one is 
your favorite at San Diego Beer Week.

Transport yourself to rural 
Thailand in director Uruphong 
Raksasad’s new film “The Songs 
of Rice,” in which you will experi-
ence the culture surrounding their 
most precious grain — rice. This 

film completes his famous “Rice 
Trilogy,” which displays the cultiva-
tion of rice and culture in Thailand 
through beautiful scenery, authen-
tic instrumentals and the simple 
sounds of nature. 

This film is different from your 
typical documentary in that it has 
no real dialogue or structure. We 
see vivid portrayals of life in the 
village with farmers plowing their 
fields and young children hunt-
ing for animals, but it’s difficult to 
understand the meaning behind the 
film due to its lack of commentary. 

As suggested by its title, the 
story builds similarly to how a song 
builds: slowly, then all at once. The 
beginning consists mainly of their 
daily lives while the peak of action 
shows an extravagant festival in a 
beautiful temple with rockets being 
shot into the air and citizens danc-
ing. 

“The Songs of Rice” lacks struc-
ture but effortlessly portrays rice 
culture in Thailand as a hidden 
beauty.

In the patriarchal world of the 
Philippines circa 1975, Muhammad 
Ali has just won the “Thrilla in 
Manila” while dictator Ferdinand 
Marcos rules under martial law. This 
serves as the backdrop for “Barber’s 
Tales,” a film following the life of sub-
servient housewife Marilou (Eugene 
Domingo) who is married to the local 
barber. However, after her husband 
suddenly dies, she takes up his scissors 
at the advice of the local priest, prov-
ing that something as mundane as a 

haircut can be a jumping-off point for 
an entire film. What ensues is a local 
and political drama that is propelled 
by the unassuming grace of lead 
Domingo. Her perpetually solemn 
expressions perfectly complement the 
washed-out palette of director Jun 
Robles Lana. All in all, the film is a 
touching blend of understated, situ-
ational humor and the personal trials 
embodied in the human condition.

leading her own investigation along

Festival-winning picture for Best

an interesting conjunction of two

It would be a hefty feat to solve the

Director Timmy Harn has a knack 
for creating laughter out of disrupted 
images and creepy characters. Harn’s 
project is as absurd as it is innovative: 
Build an overblown melodrama, place 
it into the context of a monster movie 
and play with the viewer’s expectation 
on these genres. The result is a well-

crafted, unintelligible joke. Asking 
for reasons in this film is a waste of 
your intellect. For every “why” you 
can think of, “Reptilia” has the same 
answer: Why not? There are times 
when weird is beautiful; here, weird 
is just weird. The fact that it works is, 
well, weird.

lated scenes that breed confusion. 
Yet, among unexpected trips to Paris 
and exploding phones, a darkly 
comedic plot that follows Mary and 
her best friend’s production of their 
high school yearbook emerges. In 
bringing the impulsive whims of the 

Twittersphere to the screen, the film 
risks disrupting the plot’s cohesive-
ness. Fortunately, these unpredictable 
interruptions work in the film’s favor 
and smarten the tired tale of a young 
girl’s explorations of identity, loss 
and love.

Clever and innovative production work steers 
rap album toward inovation

ALBUM   REVIEW

It’s been a painfully dry year for anyone who loves rap and hip-hop. After a fairly disap-
pointing album from Chris Brown in 
September and a heart-wrenchingly 
underwhelming debut from Logic 
last month, a new release from the 
dependable East 
Coast-duo Run the 
Jewels is like a drink 
of fresh water. It may 
not be an ice-cold 
glass of it with some 
sliced cucumber, but 
it’ll hold us over for 
a few months until 
Kendrick Lamar or 
Chance the Rapper 
finally decide to 
release something.

Both professional 
rappers since the early ’90s, Killer 
Mike and El-P have flows that speak 
for themselves. On “Lie, Cheat, Steal,” 
Mike smoothly rhymes, “I’m fly as a 
Pegasus, that’s no embellishment / I’m 
here to pain the whole game, where 
the Excedrin?” El-P, though less well-
known, can easily hold his own. In 
one of his more creative moments, 
he tells everyone to fuck off with the 
line, “You can all run naked backward 
through a field of dicks,” balancing out 
Mike’s deadpan seriousness.

In fact, El-P’s levity is completely 
necessary since the content of the 
lyrics does occasionally get preachy 
as they cover social justice often and 
too directly. These are peppered into 
songs like “All Due Respect” and “Lie, 

Cheat, Steal” and heaped onto oth-
ers like “Early” and “Close Your Eyes 
(And Count To Fuck).” While these 
moments don’t spoil the album, it can 
be distracting when Mike is rapping 
about himself and, seemingly without 
reason, interrupts it with something 

along the lines of, 
“And also, fuck cops 
for being unfair to 
black people.”

More noteworthy 
than the lyrics are 
the beats and hooks, 
the source of most 
of the originality of 
the album. The true 
gem of the album, 
“Jeopardy,” opens 
with a basic bass line 
and builds continu-

ously, adding in horns and guitar until 
the climax at the end of the first verse. 
It’s intense enough that if Killer Mike 
had chosen to rap about kittens and 
flowers, it still would have sounded 
as badass as a movie line delivered by 
Samuel L. Jackson. El-P’s combina-
tion of trap beats and heavy sampling 
define much of the album and his 
vulgar hook on “Love Again” provides 
the most quotable standout moment 
on the record. Though not enough to 
completely compensate for some lyri-
cal shortcomings, RTJ2 has enough 
substance to be worth at least a first 
and second listen.

"la isla bonita" 
by deerhoof
Release Date Nov. 4

Vintage indie-punk band pleases with 20 years 
of psychedelic sound morphed into one album.

CONCERT  REVIEW

Peculiarity and obscurity are what Deerhoof epitomizes. Celebrating its 20th anni-
versary as a band, Deerhoof is back 
again with its weird, gritty sound 
and a new album, “La Isla Bonita.” 
After two decades of venturing 
between hard rock and relaxed 
alternative, the band has created 
an album that generates a sound 
embodying a bit of everything. 
Mainly taking inspiration from The 
Ramones’ song “Pinhead,” Deerhoof 
composed a raw album that reflects 
the eerie sound they began with.

The opening song, “Paradise 
Girls,” acts as a contrast to the 
obscure tone, beginning with an 
upbeat tempo that rhythmically 
invites listeners to bob their heads 
blissfully. The guitar and subtle 
drumbeats accentuate the chill vibe 
that is established from the first 
minute of the album. The swiftness 
of the song, however, is not promi-
nent in the rest of the album, as it 
quickly turns eccentric and somber.

“Tiny Bubbles” establishes the 
somewhat repetitive gloomy and 
edgy vibe throughout the rest of the 
album. Alongside the drums and 
guitar, the vocals add the gloomy 
notes that shape the track’s morose 
mood. It is especially satisfying 
how Deerhoof manages to make 
a song sound heavy while still 
embracing a soft, alternative aspect.

Lead singer Satomi Matsuzaki 
enunciates her relaxed yet brittle 
voice throughout the musically 

changing songs. She joined the band 
early on and has been a key compo-
nent in the production of its unique 
sound. Similarly, Chris Cohen’s 
notable style on guitar contributes 
immensely to each album by creating 
almost dreamlike sound vibrations. 
Most songs on this album begin with 
a distinct guitar melody that eventu-
ally blends with Matsuzaki’s voice. 
The different tones, melodies and 
riffs that Cohen incorporates make 
for bizarre tracks. Although most of 
the songs just sound like pure noise, 
listeners can appreciate many of the 
styles incorporated within them, like 
the high-pitched guitar riffs or the 
mellow chord changes, due in part to 
Cohen’s virtuosic guitar playing.

Toward the end of the album, 
Deerhoof slows things down musi-
cally and rhythmically. “Black Pitch” 
reiterates the somber music they 
have made for the last 20 years. The 
cheerful guitar and major chords of 
the vocals act as a euphoric contrast 
to the album and slowly closes it. 

Deerhoof blends dramatic guitar 
noises, harmonious screeches and 
calm melodies to create a wonder-
fully melancholic album, even 
though it’s a bit repetitive in style. 
The band breaches out of their typi-
cal style of music to create “La Isla 
Bonita,” a mellifluous twist on mod-
ern punk rock.

FENCING

Dominant Showing at IFCSC Duals
Fencing sweeps all competitors, easily takes top spot for both men and women.

The UCSD fencing team put 
on quite a show this past Sunday 
as it continued its dominant per-
formance this season, beating all 
competitors at the Intercollegiate 
Fencing Conference of Southern 
California Duals. 

The IFCSC Duals, held at the 
California Institute of Technology, 
was comprised of five other oppos-
ing teams representing their schools 
including the University of South-
ern California, Pasadena City Col-
lege, UC Santa Barbara, UCLA and 
UC Irvine.

The matches consisted of con-
tests in the foil, epee and sabre with 
a highest possible score of nine 
points in each category, making the 
matches against a competing school 
best out of 27 points. 

The UCSD women’s squad was able 
to shut out both Pasadena City College 
and UC Irvine by a perfect 27–0 score, 
and the UCSD men’s squad did like-
wise against Pasadena while winning 
24–3 against UC Irvine. 

The Tritons defeated all com-
petitors by a large margin of points; 
competitors only scored six points 
across all of their matchups. 

UCSD beat UCLA 24–3 for both 

the men’s and women’s squads. 
The Tritons defeated USC with re-
cords of 23–4 for men and 25–2 for 
women. When they faced off against 
UCSB, they emerged victorious with 
scores of 21–6 for men and 25–2 for 
women. The men’s team won its con-
test against UC Irvine with a score 
of 24–3. 

As a whole, the men’s team’s foils 
went 42–3, only losing those three 
bouts to USC. Its epee went on for 
a record of 38–7 and its sabre went 
39–6 overall. Junior sabre Drew 
Dickinson performed impressively, 
going a perfect 12–0.

The women’s team’s foils finished 
off with an impressive 42–3 as well. 

The women team’s epee also fol-
lowed through with a 42–3 overall. 
Its sabre went even farther and won 
with a near flawless finish of 44–1, 
losing only a single bout against 
USC. Junior foil Alina Marshall fin-
ished with a perfect 11–0 score and 
freshman foil Sophia Holmqvist 
posted a perfect 10–0 score. 

The UCSD fencing team looks 
to wrap up the fall season on a high 
note as it hosts the annual Blade-
Runner tournament on Nov. 15 to 
16. Matches will begin at 9 a.m. in 
RIMAC Arena.

Tennis Will Take Hiatus, Resume Season Play in January

in round 32 of the qualifying match. 
However, after dropping to the con-
solation bracket he was quick to 
recover, taking the next two wins 
in straight sets and reaching the 
semifinals. Unfortunately, rain and 
inclement weather forced officials 
to end the tournament prematurely.

In addition to his resiliency in 
single play, Porutiu fared just as well 
in double play. Porutiu and sopho-
more Alexandre Miaule were able to 
make it to the doubles’ main draw 
after two dominating victories.

The freshman duo of Justin 
Zhang and Eric Tseng continued 
to display the potential impact they 
make on the Triton squad. Despite 
losing their matches, the pair was 
able to force at least one of their sin-
gle matches to three games against 
more experienced players, a promis-
ing sign for the coaches, players and 
the program.

“Justin and Eric are showing 

great potential competing against 
experienced opponents with some 
close matches,” Willing said. “I feel 
as they play more collegiate level 
matches they will be a force our op-
ponents will have to prepare for.” 

With the fall slate coming to a 
close, the Tritons will not be on the 
court again until Jan. 17, when they 
take on crosstown rival San Diego 

State in an exhibition match. 
“Each tournament we seem to 

have a few players excel and im-
prove,” Willing said. “As a whole, 
we need to makes some adjustments 
to each player’s game and I’m con-
fident our team will be successful.”

UCSD Nows Fall to Fifth Place Tie in CCAA Standings 

last few games go, and we’re just not 
doing what we need to do. We put 
ourselves in a bad spot.”

The Tritons were swept at home for 
the first time in the 2014 season on Sat-
urday by Sonoma State. The Seawolves 
trounced UCSD offensively, hitting 
0.241 off strong serving to the Tritons’ 
0.176. Sonoma State also beat UCSD 
on sideouts and kills while commit-
ting less errors overall. However, the 

Tritons were on top in both digs and 
blocks even as the Sonoma State of-
fense produced a great night.

Despite the loss, UCSD started 
the match leading 4–0, a welcome 
change for the two previous slow 
starts that cost them the last two 
games. Freshman outside hitter 
Amanda Colla and junior setter 
Heidi Sierks both had double-dou-
bles on the night, producing 10 kills, 
10 hits, 24 assists and 15 digs. 

UCSD holds its last homestand of 

the year this weekend with matches 
against No. 15 Cal State San Bernardi-
no on Friday, Nov. 7th and Humboldt 
State on Saturday, Nov. 8. Both games 
are scheduled for 7 p.m. at RIMAC 
Arena. The Tritons will honor their 
three seniors Brenton, junior outside 
hitter and opposite Rachel Gam and 
sophomore setter Alyssa Lin on Sat-
urday before the match is set to begin.

Hard losses came at home last 
weekend for UCSD women’s volley-
ball team, as it lost in five sets against 
San Francisco State only to be swept 
for the first time in the 2014 season 
by Sonoma State the next night. The 
Tritons’ record dropped to 10–7 
in the California Collegiate Ath-
letic Association, 12–9 overall, and 
UCSD now shares fifth place in the 
league with Cal Poly Pomona. 

UCSD lost the first two sets 
against San Francisco State last Fri-
day at RIMAC Arena, only to come 
back in the third to make the match 
contestable. Senior opposite Cait-
lin Brenton led the rally effort and 
made a double-double on the match 
with 21 kills and 19 digs to propel 
the Tritons past the Gators in the 
fourth. In the deciding set the Ga-

tors regained control and ultimately 
defeated UCSD 15–9. UCSD hit 
0.138 that night, and with the win, 
San Francisco State managed to tie 
the season series against the Tritons.

“We’re in a situation right now in 

the conference where a lot of teams 
are beating each other,” head coach 
Ricci Luyties told the UCSD Ath-
letics Department. “We’ve let these

The UCSD men’s tennis team 
concluded its fall season this past 
Sunday, Nov. 2,  at the 58th Annual 
Southern California Intercollegiate 
Championship at UCLA. Junior Ho-
rea Porutiu and senior Axel Bouillin 
both had impressive performances 
as the two advanced to the quarter-
finals of the main draw consolation 
bracket.

Despite losing in the main brack-
et, both Porutiu and Bouillin were 
able to make the best of their early 
losses by excelling in the consola-
tion bracket. 

Starting in round 32 of the main 
bracket qualifying match, Porutiu 
defeated Concordia University Ir-
vine’s freshman Hayden Hensley in 
straight sets with scores of 6–2 and 
6–3. Porutiu faced a stronger op-

ponent in the following game in To-
kyo native and UCLA junior Ryoto 
Tachi. Despite winning the first set 
6–4, Porutiu fell 6–1 and 6–2 in the 
following two sets, relegating him to 
the consolation bracket.

The consolation bracket brought 
on another tough opponent in UC 
Irvine freshman Caryl Hernandez, 
who pushed Porutiu to three sets. 
The final tie-breaking set had Poru-
tiu take a 10–3 victory.

“This weekend at UCLA was full 
of high-level competition that our 
guys responded to very well,” UCSD 
head coach Timmer Willing told the 
UCSD Athletic Department. “I feel 
Horea is really playing at a high level 
right now and with some minor ad-
justments can make a large impact 
during the season.”

Bouillin dropped his first game

Coming in with a four-game win 
streak, the No. 6 nationally ranked 
UCSD men’s water polo team looks 
to extend its impressive play as the 
regular season winds down. The 
Tritons will close out their final pair 
of matches at home, taking on a tough 
opponent in No. 4 Long Beach State 
on Thursday before taking on No. 12 
UC Irvine on Senior Night. 

“Having this essentially be our 
last stretch at home, I don’t think it’s 
really hit me yet,” senior utility Josh 
Stiling told the UCSD Guardian. “I 
don’t think it will until after the game 
on Saturday. We just got to go out and 
play as hard as we can.”  

At the conclusion of the regular 
season schedule, UCSD will next 
look towards the Western Water Polo 
Association conference champion-
ships starting on Friday, Nov. 21. The 
Tritons, who recently finished their in-
league schedule, will enter the tourna-
ment as the No. 1 seed with a perfect 
6–0 record in WWPA play. 

If the Tritons win the league cham-
pionship, they will move on to play in 
the NCAA Championship. Returning 
to nationals will bear even more sig-
nificance this year, as the NCAAs are 
set to be held at home at UCSD’s 
Canyonview Aquatics Center pool. 

While the Tritons will enter this 

year’s postseason showing strong 
promise, the team remains focused on 
the current matches at hand. Reaching 
the national stage is no guarantee, 
meaning this Saturday’s match could 
serve as the final home game for this 
year’s class of seniors. 

“It’s bittersweet,” Stiling said. 
“UCSD has given me a lot. It helped 
me grow so much in the game and 
even in life.”

Prior to the senior night’s match, 
a strong and large departing class, 
including senior utility Luca De Vivo,  
senior two-meter Joe Dietrich, senior 
utility David Higginson, senior two-
meter Dan Lorch, senior two-meter 
Matt Michalko, senior goalkeeper 
Cameron Ravanbach, Josh Stiling, 
senior utility Daniel Straub and senior 
utility Lukas Syka will all be honored.

“I’m satisfied with my career here 
and how I’ve progressed,” Ravanbach 
said. “It’s just crazy to think that there’s 
only five weeks left in my water polo 
career. I know I’ve got to step up my 
game and have fun with it.” 

Thursday’s match will commence 
at 7 p.m. at Canyonview Aquatics 
Center, while Saturday’s game will 
start at noon.
