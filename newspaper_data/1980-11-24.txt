History Professor Emory Tolbert faces tenure review 

again this year. Much controversy surrounds the review 
process in his case. 

UCSD's affirmative action 
rapped by Watson report 
Suggest numerous ways to improve program 

BY PETER MORTENSEN 
News Editor 

A majority of minorities at 
UCSD believe that their 
representation on campus 
has taken a sharp downward 
turn in recent years, 
according to a report on 
affirmative action here 
issued by Third College 
ProvostJoe Watson. 

The 25-page report sharply 
criticizes the administra-
tion's lack of sensitivity and 
poor attitude toward 
minority recruitment and 
rentention. But Watson says 
that these attitudes are not 
permanent, and he expects 
that his report, commission-
ed by Chancellor Richard 
Atkinson upon his arrival 
last] une, will be the starting 
point for change. 

Watson interviewed 
dozens of UCSD students, 
faculty and staff who are 
involve in the much-
criticized affinnative action 
program here in order to 
formulate his recommen-
dations for the program's 

, 

improvement. 
Now it is up to department 

heads campus-wide to reply 
to the report. Their 
evaluations and further 
suggestions are due in the 
Chancellor's office by next 
Monday. 

The Chancellor was out of 
town last week, but his 
assistant , Pat Ledden, said 
that the report was "very 
comprehensive" and "gener-
ally very good." Atkinson and 
Watson will meet on 
Wednesday to discuss the 
report and its implications, 
he said. 

According to Watson, the 
Chancellor will use the report 
as a base on which to build a 
master plan for better 
affirmaive action at UCSD. 

"One of the critical things 
is to differentiate between 
monitoring and evaluation 
and implementation and 
achievement. The affirma-
tive action officer can only 
monitor and evaluate, they 
cannot acheive because they 
are not line officers of the 
administration," he added. 

And Watson believes that 
it is at the line officer level 
where affirmative action at 
UCSD may be breaking 
down. He said that imple-
mentation at that level is not 
effective, perhaps because 
monitoring and evaluation at 
other levels is also 
insufficient. 

"Somewhere along that 
line there has been a 
breakdown," he explained, 
noting that the restructuring 
of the program within 
definite lines of responsibil-
ity should being alleviateing 
the problem. 

Tolbert's tenure a touchy 
subject - faces final review 

"I think the best approach 
is to view my recommenda-
tions as a starting point. I 
certainly personally would 
like to see them implemented 
but I think input' of others, 
particularly those who would 
be responsible for di charg-
ing the tasks and duties, have 
to have considerable input 
and their considerations and 
recommendations should 
carry considerable weight," 
Watson said. 

"I would never want to say 
that my report is the perfect 
and all encompassing 
answer," he added. 

Another of the report's 
recommendations, a Chan-
cellor's Advisory Committee 
on Affirmative Action, is 
already in operation to a 
certain extent. 

The commitee, charged 
with representing and 
dealing With many phases of 
affirmative action on 
campus, met last week to 
discuss the Watson report. BY STEVE GOLDSTICK 

Staff Writer 
At one time or anot.h@&:, 

whether, it has been for a 
class, working at a job, or in a 
relationship, all of us have 
been in a sItuation where we 
don't quite know what is 
expected of us. 

How much 'and what are 
we expected to give of 
ourselves before what we are 
striving for is given to us? 

And even after we have 
done all that we thought was 
wanted of us, what is to 
assure us that we will receive 
what we deserve? 

In the time that he has been 
a part of UCSD and working 
towards his tenure, Professor 
Emory Tolbert has encount-
ered these problems. 

Professor Tolbert is no 
stranger to the complicated 
tenure process. Two years 
ago, he was reviewed for 
tenure, as are most 
professors after their sixth 
year of service. But his 
tenured associates in the 
history department, who are 
responsible for awarding 
tenure, rejected Tolbert's bid 
and chose to postpone 
Tolbert's fate. 

fn January, Tolbert will be 
reviewed for the last time. 
The professor will be either 
tenured or dismissed at the 
end of this academic year. 

Today's Weather 
Low clouds and a cool 

night with a sunny 
afternoon. The lows will 
be in the low 40s and the 
highs in the low 70s. The 
water temperature is 61 
degrees with breakers of 
three to four feet every 14 
seconds. 

Tolbert came to UCSD in 
1972, with a PhD from UCLA 
and a specialized background 
in American Intellectual 
History of Afro-American 
Studies. Tolbert has recently 
published a book on the 
Marcus Garvey movement 
and is currently working on 
another book on the Harlem 
Rennaissance. 

Tolbert i's"l>J1e of only two 
black and one of the few 
minority professors in the 
history department here. He 
is also one of six out of 25 
professors in that depart-
ment who are un tenured. 

Why Tolbert was denied 
tenure two years ago is 
unclear. 

One of Tolbert's most vocal 
supporters is the, Black 
Student's Union (BSU), 
which backed his bid' for 
tenure two years ago and last 
week Qersuaded the Associ-
ated Students' to pass a 
resolution supporting his 
tenure. 

"Last ' time, there really 
was no logical reason, in my 
view and many others', why 
he was denied tenure," says 
BSU Chairman Ken Overton. 
"He got generally food 
reviews in all three 0 the 
areas in which tenure is 
reviewed by, and this time he 
is even more qualified in the 
area where he was thought to 
be the weakest, research. 

"The other two, teaching 
and service, he was given 
excellent ratings. All you 
have to do is take one of his 
classes to find out how he can 
motivate the students," 
Overton continues. "It seems 
to me that black people are 
being systematically shifted 
OJ,lt of the UC system." 

Overton explains that the 
number of black professors at 
UCSD has declined from 36 
in 1974 to only 18 at present. 

"The population of black 
(students) is also on the 
decline here," Overton says. 
"In 1978 the population was 
4.4 percent, in '79 it was 4.1 
percent and this year it is 
only 2.9 percent. This seems 
to be the general trend at 
universities across the 
country and it is something 
all minorities should be 
concerned aout. 

In light of Tolbert 's new 
book, Overton says that if it 
was a lack of research last 
time he was denied tenure, I 
don't see any reason how he

One of the most substanti· 
al changes Watson proposes 
is the creation of an

post. This new administra· 
tive position would be 
"defined as principle advisor 
to the Chancellor and Vice 
Chancellors on affirmative 
action policies, procedures, 
goals and objectives," the 
report said.

these areas .. . in tenns of

Watson said. 

According to committee 
chairman Nick Aguilar, the 
group's 18 members thought 
that the report was "quite 
comprehensive," yet they 
offered some criticism of 
several of the report 's major 
recommendations. 

Specifically, Aguilar said 
there was some displeasure 
with the plan to have 
subcommittees of the 
chancellor's advisory 
committee designed to 
investigate staff, student and 
faculty facets of affirmative 
actions. 

He suggested that the

'Gay' page was shocking 
Editor: 

To my shock and disap-
pointment I found in the 
Guardian a whole page 
devoted to the views of a 
homosexual group on 
campus - The Gay Students 
of UCSD (The Daily 
Guardian, Nov. 20). r have 
been informed that their 
meetings are quite legal and 
are apparently funded by 
UCSD students through fees 
paid each quarter allocated 
by the Associated Students. 
It seems the most vocal and 
organized groups are able to 

win some kind of approval, 
while the vast majority of 
students who are basically 
opposed to this sort of thing 
quietly go about their 
studying, never voting in the 
AS elections. 

Not withstanding what the 
psychiatrists say, homo· 
sexuality is a lifestyle, a 
choice, not something one is 
born with. Where is the voice 
on this campus that will 
speak out against this 
immorality? 

JOHN J. JENNINGS

Give the Navy a chance 
Editor: 

J am writing in -r~rd to 
the picture the GuardIan ran 
of the Navy recruiting car 
defaced with an anti · 
militaristic slogan (The Daily 
Guardian, Nov. 20). I am also 
expressing some general 
sentiments about posters I 
have seen around campus 
advertising for meetings 
whose purpose it is to bar 
military recruiters from 
campus. Let me first state 
that I am a political and social 
liberal, but my sense of fair 
play has been violated by 
some events about which I'm 
commenting. 

I hope those responsible for 
defacing the Navy car don 't 
delude themselves by 
thinking that this was a 
political act of protest against 
militarism, It was actually 
childis h and vulgar and 
probably a misdemeanor. No 
one has the right to damage 
another 's property, even if 
t he o ther is th e US 
government. 

Those responsible for the 
defacement and those 
holding meetings to bar 
recruiters from the military 
on campus have obviously 
made up their minds about 
the mihtary, which is fine. 
But why do they wish to keep 
information (any information 
- even the government's) 
away from others who may 
not have enough to make 
their own choices about 
issues such as these? And I 
find it curious that anyone 
would wish to restrict or 
censor any information that 
would help these choices to be 
made. I therefore don ' t 
understand why the military 
should be prevented from 
recruiting on campus, so long 
as any other civilian group or 
company is allowed access, as 
many are.

chance to _give their s ide of 
the story. Even if that up et

violations, whether they're 
economic or political, must be 
stopped. There is no crime 
involved in asking for a more 
equitable distribution of the 
wealth of a country to its 
hardworking people. There is 
no crime involved in asking 
for at least self·sufficient jobs 
with wages enough to buy 
food, clothing and shelter. 
Much less is it a crime to ask 
for appropriate education and 
health facilities where the 
children of EI Salvador can 
grow up to be. a proud and 

, respected people. But in EI 
Salvador it is considered a 
severe crime punishable by 

the most brutal and 
inhumane acts of death and 
torture.

ity with the People of EI 
Salvador - Farabundo Marti 
- has many sincere 
aspirations and hopes that 
you, the readers of this

On Mrs. Lowe's weekly quizzes 
Editor: 

In the beginning of this 
quarter The Daily Guardian 
published several letters 
concerning evaluations and 
alterations of a few of the 
French Literature classes. 
Since then, more evaluations 
have taken place and more 
alterations have been 
planned for the future. As a 
current student of a French 
Lit. 10 class, with Mrs. C. 
Lowe as head instructor, I 
shall in these following lines 
put forth a few modest 
suggestions which, if acted 
upon, can immediately 
improve the present sorry 
situation of many French Lit. 
10 classes. 

First, in defense of . the 
French language, I must 
disparage the popular 
(although inerrant) notion 
that French is a dead 
language and not worth the 
trouble acquiring. Of course, 
this is absolutely false. Any 
nation that continued to hold 
pu blic guillotine executions 
until the 1930s and now 
honors Jerry Lewis as the 
greatest comedian of all time 
is certainly worthy of any 
efforts expended to learn its 
langu"ie, 

My fIrst suggestion would 
be to continue with the fair 
and decent method of Mrs. 
Lowe's weekly quizzes . 
Nothing inspires a student 
more than when new and 
totally unlearned material is 
introduced to him during a 
test. We all enjoy arduously 
preparing the week's lesson. 
(reading the assigned 
chapters several times, doing 
all the assigned exercises) 
and finding our newly gained 
knowledge applicable only to 
the previous week's test. It is 
quite satisfying to tudy all 
week on prepo itions and 
conditional tenses only to be 
te ted on di s jun c ti ve 

pronouns and adverbial 
phrases (which, of course, are 
then assigned to be studied 
the following week ) . 
Predicting the general 
content of any test is an 
abhorrence and should , be 
avoided at all costs (the end in 
thi case justifies any 
means). Weekly quizzes are a 
wonderful way of intro· 
ducing the student to new 
material (vocabulary, 
sentence structure, idioms, 
etc.) that is so esoteric that 
the T As cannot explain the 
answers to the tests ..... they 
themselves hand out. 

A further ,~ugges-tion 
would be to continue the 

pr~ctice of allowing 
beginning French linguistics 
students to progress through 
three quarters of college level 
language instruction that 
minimizes any emphasis on 
grammar. These students 
will naturally be attracted to 
French Lit. 10, which will 
intensively review grammar 
they have yet to learn. 

Additional original 
suggestions would include: 
(1) allowing the TAs to use 
electric cattle prods to wake 
up drowsing students, and (2) 
hanging chronically late or 
absent students by their 
thumbs. I expect some 
readers will object to my two 
latter proposals on the 
grounds that they are cruel 
and des tructive. Those 
readers will be relieved to 
know that no amount of 
cruelty or damage planned 
for the future could ever 
match that already done by 
Mrs. Lowe's weekly quizzes. 

I also suspect that many 
readers will presume that I 
put forth these modest 
sugges tions for my own 
personal interest and benefit. 
I ! incerely reply that I have 
no motive other than the 
general good of my chool, the 

advancement of pragmatic 
educational techniques, and 
a concern for the sinking 
French Department. I shall 
not be taking any French Lit. 
classes in the future; I shall 
instead direct my endeavors 
toward relatively easier 
pursuits such as integral 
calculus, astrophysics and 
getting into medical school.

Walkers have 
rights, too 

Editor: 
Okay - enough's enough. I 

thought it was bad that 
mopeds , motorcycles and 
official university vehicles 
use the bike and pedestrian 

. paths around the campus, 
but what I saw today really 
made me mad. Some jerk was 
driving his/her new red 
Honda Accord around the 
paths between Third College 
and Central Library! 

Are the paths intended for 
bicycles and pedestrians 
only. or as general use 
thoroughfares? I can't 
understand why the 
university's collection of 
Cushman carts, mini· 
pickups and full · size 
vehicles, as well as others 
with mopeds and motor· 
cycles can't use the roads, 
leaving the paths to people 
who ride bikes and skate-
boards or who walk and run. 
It's not so bad now having to 
walk in the dirt to avoid being 
run over, but I can imagine 
what it' s going to be like this 
winter when the rains turn 
the dirt to mud.

TEHRAN - Iran asked

Tolbert's tenure a sensitive matter 
continued from paje 1 
could be denied at this time." 

Alan Mitchell, chairman of 
the history depattment, says 
Tolbert's tenure rejection 
WM not a case of racial 
discrimination. 

"First of all, the idea of 
anyone being discriminated 
against because of their color 
isludKrous. VVetrytojud~a 
professor as fairly as poSSible 
on the work he has done at 
the univerSity. Of course, at a 

were to happen, we would go 
out and try to find another 
black professor who is." 

Just exactly how a 
recommendation is made for 
acceptance or rejection of a 
professor's bid for tenure is 
kept confidential from the 
public. 

But because each profes· 
sbr's file goes through several 
review committees before a 
final decision is made, it 
would be difficult to make a 

We try to judge a professor as fairly 
as possible on the work he has done. .. 
university of this caliber, the 
qualifications for a professor 
are going to be high, but to 
say he is being discriminated 
against is just a lie," Mitchell 
says. 

"When we review some· 
one, all three qualifications 
must be up to the standards 
we set. Just because someone 
is strong in two of the three 
areas doesn't mean it will 
offset the third," Mitchell 
adds. "It is easy for ~le 
who aren't involved 10 the 
decision·making process to 
make judgements, but when 
you're on the inside and a 
person's career is at stake, 
you're a llttle more Wary." 

"Any time somebody is 
. ~ing to be judged on quality, 

It is going to be subjective," 
Mitchell says. "But as to any 
Jl"ejudice beirul involved, let 
me say this: If we don't grant 
Professor Tolbert tenure, it 
will because we do not feel he 
is fully qualified. And if that 

prejt.ldiced decision, says 
Acting Vice Chancellor of 
Academic Affairs John Miles, 
who has the finaf say on 
Tolbert's tenure. 

The tenure process is 
complicated and often takes 
months to complete. 

"It is a lot more 
complicated than people 
think, it is no simrle matter. 
Each individua case is 
treated individually and 
when we are in doubt about a 
professor's proficiency in a 
particular area, we will seek 
outside opinions." , 

First, the professor's file is 
reviewed by the tenured 
professors of his or her 
department. VVithin about a 
month, the department then . 
makes its recommendation to 
the Committee on Academic 
Personnel (CAP). 

Mitchell says that the 
department's recommenda· 
tion usually dictates what 
the final decision will be. 

When Tolbert was last up 
for tenure review, the history 
department voted against 
him by a " s ubstantial 
margin , " according to 
Mitchell. 

In addition to faculty 
letters, each professor's file 
contains letters submitted by 
students. Overton believes 
the only reason Tolbert was 
given a two-year extension 
after his tenure rejection was 
because of all the student 
suport he received. ' 

After the department's I 
. recommendation is made, the 
file is then given to the CAP, 
which consists of various 
UCSD administrators who 
review the ' file and the 
department's recommenda· 
tion. 

From there the file is sent 
for review to an ad hoc 
committee. The members of 
the five person committee are 
kept secret, but according to 
Miles the committee usually 
contains at least one tenured 
professor from the reviewed 
profe'ssor's department. 
Their ' recommendation is 
added to the file and then sent 
back to the CAP. 

The CAP then makes its 
recommendation and gives 
the file, along with the 
judgements of the Dean of 
Graduate Studies and the 
department chairman, to the 
Vice Chancellor of Academic 
Affairs for a final decision. 

The Vice Chancellor of 
Acadmemic jJI ffairs consults 
with Chancellor Richard 
Atkinson and deliberates 
"very thoroughly" for about 
three months, according to 
Miles. 

"The system iSl1't perfect, 
though I can say it is more 
thorough than most tenure 
processes at other universi · 
ties," Miles s ays . " At 
Harvard, the president is able 
to decide who gets tenure or 
not. We are always trying to 
improve the thoroughness of 
our methods." 

Tolb,ert's departmental 
review was ori~nally set up -
for Dec., but was jX)stjX)ned 
until January at Tolbert's 
request. Tolbert says he 
wanted the extra time to 
allow his recently published 
book to circulate. 

That extension will not 
have any adverse effects on 
the outcome of the decis ion, 
nor will his past bid for 
tenure, Mitchell says. " I 
think my collea~es will 
judge him fairly, ' Mitchell 
stresses. 

minds and 01 hers do not. " 
Because professors are 

evaluated heavily on their 
research , they often sacrifice 
time from their students. 
Even so, they are in no way 
guaranteed tenure. 

Linda Sabo, chairwoman of 
the Student Body Presidents 
Council and a UCSD student , 
notes, "Though I have not 
been directly involved with 
the Tolbert case, there are 
times I have seen when a 
department will tell a 
professor to do this and this if 
he wants to be qualified. 
Then t hey will do it, go up for 
tenure, and they'll say that 's 
not what they were looking 
for. " 

But some professors, 
according to Miles, " will 
work very hard until they get 
their tenure but after that 
they sort of slack of!." 

... it is difficult to tell exactly what 
committee members ' look for ... 

The past two years , 
though, have given Tolbert a 
chance.to work on perfecting 
his rook. [t is up to his 
colleagues now to judge his 
work. 

In explaining how the 
department is going to 
receive Tolbert 's new output 
Mitchell says "a great deal 
depends" on what new work 
Tolbert has produced. 

VVhen asked how other 
department members will 
respond to Tolbert's recent 
work, Mitchell says, "Some 
of them have made up their 

• I 

Because a professor's file is 
kept confidential, it is 
difficult to tell exactly what 
committee members look for 
in professors' performance, 
but Mitchell explains that 
three main elements are 
examined. 

One such element is 
service, which can mean 
contributions of a professor's 
time to the community, to the 
university or to the 
professor's department. 
Tolbert says he received a 
good rating in that area two

"We Looked at 
All the Deals 

, 

in San Diego ... 

Then 
I Bought 

My First Home 
at Park Villas!" 

The Daily Guardian 

"My folks wanted me to have a safe p'lace to live and I wanted 
my own home. 

I wanted a convenient location . .. and Park Villas had the 
best, in the heart of Mission Valley. 

I didn't want a complex that felt like a hotel ... Park Villas is 
like a private park and every condominium home has its own 
outside entry. 

We wanted the best price ... and Park Villas had it. Homes are 
available from $48,990 to $87,990. 

We wanted the best terms ... Park Villas offered 12:Y4% 
financing for a full 30 years and they paid $1250 of my closing 
costs. 

I wanted a San Diego lifestyle ... Park Villas offered it, PLUS! 
Park Villas has four heated swimming pools, four whirpool 
spas and two recreation centers ... and its incredible location. 

That's why my folks helped me buy my first home at Park 
Villas. I'm building my equity in a great place to live and they 
got the tax shelter they needed. Park Villas encourages co-
borrower financing to help young people get started. 

If you're looking for your first home, or a step-up, check Park 
Villas last ... because they have it all!"

CALPIRG 
surveys 
liquor 

Tolbert's tenure 

After spending a Friday 
evening in the UCSD dorms 
or a night at a Del Mar party, 
one can see why the campus 
branch of CalPIRG felt it 
necessary to survey local 
stores that sell liquor to find 
the "lowest prices overall." 

During weekend visits of 
eight local stores, the 
CalPIRG researchers found 
that Vons in Cardiff offers 
the lowest average prices on 
the liquor surveyed. 

Following Vons were: 
Thrifty-Genesee High-
lands, Sav-On-Del Mar, Big 
Bear-Del Mar, Safeway-
Genesee Highlands, Ralphs-
La Jolla Village Square, 
Zel's-Del "Mar and St. 

Germaine's~La Jolla. 
The groups also broke 

down its survey, indicating 
which store has the lowest 
prices on particular types of 
alcoholic beverages. 

(Beverage - N:umber of 
brands averaged - Lowest 
priced store.> 

Beer - Eleven brands, 
Vons. 

Wine (rose) - Four brands,

A second element studied 
in tenure review is classroom 
performance. 

"Just because a teacher 
might be funny, entertaining 
or easy to get a good grade 
from, that doesn't mean he is 
a good teacher, " Miles notes. 

Tolbert has recieved 
favorable student evaluation 
of his teaching abilities over 
the past several years. 

"He's a motivating 
person; he presents the 
material in a way where it is 
understandable and not 
boring at all," comments one 
student in Tolbert's race and 
ethnicity history class. "It's 
really said, though, to see the 
amount of ethnic professors 
decreasing. Ethnic studies is 
a field I'm interested in and 
Professor Tolbert is very 
stimulating. Since I've .been 
here the department has 
offered less and less. It's 
!lad." 

This decrease, according to 
one person who asked not to 
be identified, results from the 
change of leadership in the 
history department. "Up 
until three years ago, 
Professor Ramon Ruiz used 
to be the chairman of the 
History Department. After he 
stepped down, there seemed 
to be a change in politics in 
the department. Less 
minority professors were 

bein~ sought out." 
MItchell points out that 

two of the four lower division 
classes currently offered by 
the department are in ethnic 
studies. 

In a recent Course and 
Professor Evaluation (CAPE) 
manual, 97 percent of 
Tolbert's students recom-
mended his class, 13 students 
thought he was interesting, 
14 considered him person· 
able, five students said they 
like the class because.of the 
professor's competency and 
because of his non-traditional 
perspective, and four 
students thought he was 
well-informed. 

A more detailed listing of Silvio Pucci, a Teaching 
brand names and prices will Assistant for Tolbert, shares 
be available in CaiPIRG's these views. "I think he is

Speaking at the event is 

complaints, stating that the 
class was "disorganized and 
dull," according to the CAPE 
report. 

The third area in which a 
professor is reviewed and is 
stressed heavily is scholar· 
ship, according to Mitchell. 

Mitchel1 points out that a 
high standard is put on 
research and publication, and 
that professors must show 
"accomplishment and 
promise." 

If a professor writes 
sOmething that department 
members are not qualified to 

review, outside criti~ues are 
solicited, accordlllg to 
Mitchell. In Tolbert's case, 
that's what they had to do. 

Tolbert is considered an 
authority on the Marcus 
Garvey Movement, the 
largest mass movement 
among black people in the 
history of the United States. 
Tolbert just recently 
published a book · on the 
subject. 

Some of the reviews that 
came out on the cover of that 
book include: 
- Professor Charles Vicente 
from Southern University 
comments, "Through the 
youth of numerous primary 
and secondary sources, 
Tolbert has given us a 
valuable synthesis on the 
Garvey movement in Los 
Angeles. He has made a 
complex topic more under· 
standable." 
- "Tolbert has also 
uncovered extremely valu· 
able data for understanding 
the social and historical 
makeup of the Los Angeles 
black community," remarked 
Robert A. Hill , editor of the 
Marcus Gavey papers Project 
at UCLA. 
- One more critic, Kennell , 
Jackson, chairman of Afro-
American studies at Stanford 
University, said, "This is an 
alive, interesting book, 
exhibitin~ features of the 
new SOClai history at its 
best...1 thou~h the book was 
truly great.' 

Tolbert says he received no 
negative reviews on his book.-

Subjective factory; may not 
be consciously taken into 
consideration, but still exist 
and effect a committee's 
recommendation, according 
to Mitchell. 

Another factor, according 
to Sabo, is "whether the 
professor plays the part 
expected of them. .. She 
explains that if the professor 
~ to university parties and 
'plays the game," it helps 

when the professor comes up 
for review. 

When asked if he has seen 
any prof's receive tenure who 
had less qualifications than 
Tolbert, Mitchell says he 
must "sidestep the ques· 
tion," explaining that his 
personal and political 
opinions sometimes differ. 

Mitchell defends the lack of 
black professors and 
students at UCSD. 

"Because this is a UC 
school, we do not have the 
funds that private schools 
such as Stanford have to 
recruit balck students. Other 
schools offer them more 
financially secure scholar· 
ships, and as a result they go 
somewhere else," he says. 

Mitchell insists there is 
nothing racist about 
Tolbert's tenure case. Each 
case is reviewed individually, 
and people who think there is 
prejudice has no "basis for 
that judgement," Mitchell 
says. 

But as Barry Hyman, a 
student member of the 
Committr.e on Educational

sentative of the Commit· 
tee of Solidarity with the '

Admission to the event 
costs $3, which includes 
dinner and a display of 
Nicaraguan posters 
depicting the National 
Literaq: Campaip there. 

Erratum 

Benefit orgalllzers say 
that funds raised at the 
dinner will be used to help 
"the people's struggle" in 
EI Salvador. 

In Friday's edition of TIle Daily Guardio", a story 
appeared indicating that the UC R.nts are "making very 
active efforts" to recruit prospectIve students currently 
underrepresented in the UC system. 

That statement should be directly attributed to the 
findings of a report made by the Regents and should not be 
interpreted as absolutely factual.

The Daily Guardian 

Tolbert 
continued from page 8 
Policy points out, "Irregard· 
less that it was pu blic , 
knowledge that Tolbert was 
an' outstanding teacher and 
had been judged as having 
good community service, and 
his research is comparable to 
anybody else who in the past 
has received tenure , he 
hasn't received it." 

"It seems to me, just from 
the basis of looking at the 
history department's actions, 
he has not received it for 
personal reasons," Hyman 
says. 

Overton says that if 
Tolbert is denied tenure 
when he comes up for review 
this time it would be "a slap 
in the face " for black 
students. 

The final decision on 
Tolbert's tenure case will 
probably be reached by May, 
so that he will have sufficient 
time to look at other 
universities if rejected , 
according to Miles. 

Tolbert said he has not 
given any thought as to what 
he would do if he is denied 
tenure. "The main thing now 
is to realize what is 
happening. After the decision 
is made, I will be able to say 
anything I want to, but right 
now I am going to wait and 
see how it turns out." 

-Watson 
continued from page 1 
hoc committees" as neces' 
sary. The dvties of the com-
mittee and the Affirmative 
Action Officer would become 
"too factionalized" other-
wise, he said. 

Aguilar applauded Watson 
for frankly criticizing the 
current program that "on 
paper appears quite good". 
but in theory is a joke," but 
he complained that Watson 
neglected to address the key 
area of minority student 
retention. 

"Considering the volume 
of work in the report, its not 

surprisn~ that one area was 
omitted,' he said. 

The committee will meet 
again Tuesday to finalize 
their response to the 
chance\1or, Aguilar said. 

Students involved in the 
affirmative action process 
also noted Watson's failure to 
address the prblem of 
minority student retention. 

Arturo Herrera, chairman 
of the Student Affirmative -
Action Committee, is wary of 
the omission, but is generally 
pleased with the report as a 
whole. 

He is also concerned with 
what will become of SAAC's 
role in recruitment and 
retention through the 
Educational Opportunity 
Progra. He assailed EOP's 
"shotgun approach" to 
recruitment, but said that as 
of late, SAAC contributions 
to the . process has helped 
improve the situation. 

Herrera was referring to 
EOP's strategy of holding 
short, hour·long recruitment 

. sessions at high schools 
throughout the state. 
Instead, Herrera said SAAC 
would like to see more in 
depth concentration on 
school in the southern part of 
the state .:.. including Los 
Angeles, Riverside, Imperial 
and San Diego CoUnties. 

He is afraid that the 
creation of a new EOP officer

Hunt, Felice closest to the mark 

BY BLAKE SHAW 
Staff w liter 

Howard Hunt. UCSD's 
Director of Phy 'sical 
Education, showed his 
students the rewards of 
consistent training as he 
came within one second of his 
predicted time for the three 
mile Turk~ Trot course on 
Saturday. For his efforts he 
carried home a 20 pound 
Thanksgiving turkey. . 

Turkeys were awarded for 
the holders of three closest 
time predictions for the short 
course of approximately 
three miles and the long 
course of approximately five 
and one half mileS.' Joe Felice 
was closest to his prediction 
for the long course; he was 
only six seconds off. Other 
turkey winners were Blake 
Shaw and Walter Shmitt for 
the short. course and Tom 
Metcalf, Mark Cunningham ' 
and Jim Miller on the ronger 
route. 

Speed was also rewarded at 
the 1'urkey Trot. The fastest 
finishers for each course · 
received a turkey or bottle of 
champagne. Blazing [hrough 
the short course with a time 
of 16:35 was Keith Hill. Kitty 
Trucco was the fastest 
woman with a time of 22:27. 

[n the long course, Steve 
Sine outpaced the others ' 
with a time of 29:40, while 
Carolyn Hoemann led the . 
women at 38:39.

to those who finished 
farthest from their predicted 
times. Bill Priest was the 
recipient for the long course 
and Deidre Yoast won the 
award in the short course.

longer course finished faster 
than their predictions due to 
a change in the course.

Watson 
continued from page 9 . 
programs as prescribed by 
Watson's report might "wipe 
the slate clean" and set back 
the recruitment plans made 
by SAAC, 

Herrera also..said that the 
creation of this new 
administrative positon 
within EOP would make 
affirmative action "too top 
heavy" and ineffective. 

Another of the report's 
proposals of concern to 
students is the creation of a 
su bcommittee to the 
chancellor's advisory 
committee that would deal 
specifically with student 
affairs. 

The committee would be 
made up of students and 
faculty members and would 
be chaired by a tenured 
faculty member. 

Herrera suggested that the 
focus of SAAC might overlap 
with that of the committee, 
but Watson said that their 
duties would be completely 
different. 

In fact, Watson said that, 
in the past, students have 
had little to do with the 
actual implementation of 
student affirmative action, 
but that once on the 
committee, they could "put 
some teeth" in the policies 
developed for recruitment 
and retention, 

Other students expressed 
concern that Watson had 
recommended that the 
committee be chaired by a 
faculty member. But Watson 
said, "[n general, [ believe 
that the faculty and staff 
have more time to devote to 
the details of committees 
than students do and a 
committee of this type has 
major policy implication for 
the campus.

Watson suggests affirmative boost 
continued from pate 11 

"It is going to require a 
chair that can put in a great 
deal of time and effort and 
who can call upon a great deal 
of knowledge and experience 
to lead the committee - and I 
don't feel a student can do 
that," he said. 

o 
Some administrations 

officials, who declined to be 
named, felt that criticism of 

specific affirmative action 
units on campus was too 
harsh, while others said that 
references to "the Adminis-
tration" in all of Watson's 
critical notices was too vague. 
to do any good.

after giving the report only a 
"curosry review." 

"I suspect that my office is 
included in those criticisms," 
Temmer said, adding that he 
would reserve a more explicit 
response until after he had 
gone through the report more 
carefully. 

Quelda Wilson, in part 
responsible for affirmative 
action for staff personnel, 
wa s not a v ailable for 

comment. Others involved in 
affirmative action in her 
office said only that they 
were working on a response 
to Atkinson and would have 
it ready by next Monday's 
deadline. 

o 
Wat on believes that in the 

legal sense, UCSD's current 
affirmative action policies 
are "adequate," but that 

"we're not as good as we 
should be." 

He said that positive 
cflange will come from a 
change in attitude brought on 
by Atkinson's efforts to deal 
with the problem "in a 
traightforward manner. " 
" The attitude of the 

administration is established 
by the chancellor - it can be 
influenced," he said.
