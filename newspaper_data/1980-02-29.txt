Muir Council Won't

BY TOBY RAYMOND 
Staff Writer 

A proposal allocating $500 in an 
effort to procure actor Buck Henry as a 
speaker for the Muir College 
graduation was denied by the Muir 
College Council because, the chair 

sai~ it would only benefit seniors. 
I he Council was not opposed to 

having Henry .peak at1he graduation, 
but hopes the funds can be spent in a 
way beneficial to a greater number of 
students, Rosemary Grobarek said. 

Henry i. a professional actor, Muir 
Dean Chip DreiliJtger said, and he 
believes it would be unfea.ible to invite 
him to speak without offering any type 
of compensation. 

There wiD be no further effort to get 
Henry to speak, Dreilinger said. 

Henry i. an acquaintance of Muir 
Provost John Stewart and it

possibility of his speaking at the

The fund. to cover the proposal 
were to come from the Council budget, 
said Grobarek. While the Council's 
annual budget is in excess of $7,000, 
onll' $1 ,400 remains unallocated. 

The unaUocated portion of the 
budget will probably be used to

I'm tired of the bad rap 

given to oil companies. Let's 
place the blame of our energy 
c'risis squarely where it 
belongs: 1 )OPEC and 2)the 
US Congress. 

OPEC initiated the 
increases - 300 percent after 
the embargo. And how did our 
Congress react to the energy 
woes? But instituting 
legislation regulating the oil 
companies, which ties their 
hands, makes devdopment of 
domestic resources impos-
sible, expands our dependence 
on foreign oil and creates 

shortages. -
Why didn ' t Congress 

respond in a rational, problem· 
solving manner? Only by 
dropping regulations price 
controls and subsidies can the 
United States once again roar 
with oil production, gas and 
coal. Only by allowing our free 
enterprise system to work will 
prices find true market level. 

And only with profits can 
new alternative energy 
sources be found. Blame not 
the oil companies but the 
greedy Arab oil cartel and a 
blind C~ress.

Guerrillas Beseiged 
By Colombian GQV't 

BOGOTA, Colombia -
With gunfire crackling around 
them, a heavily armed band of 
young leftist guerrillas dug in 
yesterday for what they vowed 
could be a months-long 
standoff at the besieged 
OOminican Republic Embas. 
sy, where they held the US 
ambassador and at least 60 
other hostages . 

It appeared the Colombian 
government might try to 
starve out the estimated 30 
terrorists , who seized the 
embassy and hostages 
Wednesday and demanded 
$50 million in ransom and 
freedom for political prisoners. 

In an effort to end the stand-
off, Panama offered to give the 
guerrillas political asylum. But 
it could not be determined 
whether the offer was 
transmitted to . the embassy. 

The guerrillas, members of 
a group called "Movement-
19," have threatened to kill 

their captives if their demands 
were not met. 

Besides American envoy 
Diego Asencio, the hostages 
included an archbishop who is 
the Vatican's diplomat here 
and ambassadors or acting 
ambassadors 01 at least 14 
other nations. 

The guerrillas said they 
were holding 20 ambassadors, 
and the State Department in 
Washington said it believed 
there were 80 hostages in all. 
. Volleys of gunfire range out 
shortly after noon yesterday, 
and the guerrilla leader told a 
reporter by telephone that 
sriipers of the Colombian 
security forces were firing on 
the building. 

There was no immediate 
WOld of any new casualties. 
The guerrillas claimed to be 
armed with pistols, rifles, 
grenades , bombs and 
abundant ammunition.

SACRAMENTO - The 
state Energy Commission has 
allocated $2 million for a 
three· year test of alcohol Iuds

It also said it would loan up 
to $3 million to private 
companies and individuals to 
develop plants to convert 
waste materials into alcohol 
for fuel . 

The object of the test in 
cars is to find out how much

Mexican Immigrants called Important 
State Should Improve Lot, Says UCSD Program's Future Director 

WASHINGTON (AP) - A new 
Iludy 01 Mexican immigrant$ in the 
UniIed States call. on the .tate of 
c.Jifomia - with ita hal immigrant 
population growins by 50,000 a year 
- to recognize their contribution to 
the .tale'. economy and culture and 
take .tepa to improve their living 
conditiona. 

The report, written by Wayne 
Cornel.... who will direct the US· 
Mexican .luGea program here starting 
in aping, .. y. "it is unrealistic to 
expect the US Congre.. to enact 
needed immi,ration reforms which 
would benefit California in the 
foreaeeable future." 

It wu preaented here yeaterday at 
the Woodrow WdlOn Center for 
International Scholan. 

CaIiIornia hal more "permanent 
Ietder" migranta from Mexico than 
any .other alate and the trend will 
continue unlet. the economy of the 
alate collapeea or ceuea to grow at 
rate. approximating thoae of recent 
year" ComeIiua .. d. 

Due to the aizable c1andeatine 
component, it is impoaaible to meaaure 
the total number of ".ettler" 
inunitranla from Mexico with an 
acceptable margin of error but tile 
maiority are either legal reaidenla or in 
the proceaa of acquiring aum .tatus, 
according to the survey. 

n.e report OOeervea that federal 
policy tightening border control. may 

ironically turn a traditionally floating 
population of Mexican migranla into a 
permanent US population because of 
the higher COila and risk. in croaaing 
the border illegally. 

But the .lOOy notes that the flow of 
migrants from Mexico to the United 
State. each year is almost equaled by 
the return flow from the United Slate. 
to place. of origin in Mexico because 
the majority of Mexicans who come to 
work in the United States in any given 
year do not want to settle permanently. 

A total of 185 migrants from the 
Mexican state of Jalisco were 
interviewed for the study in six 
California and four lI~nois cities. 
About half were in the United States 
illegaUy. 

Sixty percent of the illegal 
immigrants came intending to settle 
beeauae they had family who assisted 
in finding work and housing. 

The remaining 40 percent, whose 
original intention was not to settle, did 
so for a variety of circwnltances: 
needing more time to achieve 
economic goals, the schoo~ng of

Cornelius said that in California the 
Mexican immigrants now "appear to 
be essential to the functioning of the 
state's economy as it is presently 
structured. California. he said. has 
probably become more dependent 
upon Mexican labor to perform a wide 
variety of tasks in ita economy, and 
upon Mexican consumers to purchase 
the goods and services which the 
state's economy produces, than any

Penhollow. .. 

Permits have also been stolen from 
rubber bumpers, which don't hold the 
stickers as well as steel. 

Success in recovering stolen permits 
has been limited. "It's not the highest 
priority crime," explained Penhollow, 
and the police "don't go out and look 
for stolen permits." 

They do carry a list of stolen permit 
nwnbers while doing routine checks for 
parking violations, and urge victims to 
report their loss to the police. 

Penhollow attributes the majority of 
permit thefts to "naive students doing a 
prank" and students "trying to beat the 
system." 

Parking permits cost $47.50/year

Pac 1 0 Schools Ordered to 
Check Athletes' Transcripts 

LOS ANGELES - The 
executive director of the 
Pacific· 1 0 Conference has 
instructed members schools to 
investigate the academic 
transcripts of all athletes, 
dating back to 1977, for 
possible irregularities. 

In a memo to the 10 
members of the conference. 

' Wiles Hallock listed 19 
suspect junior colleges and 
institutions which offer 
extension courses. Hallock 
would not name the 19 schools 
listed. 

The memo said that if 
member schools found 
athletes had received credit 
from any of the 19, "we 
suggest you conduct an 
internal investigation to 
determine if the credits were 
properly earned and report the 

results of your investillation to 
the conlerence office." 

During the past few months. 
athletes at four member 
schools have been found to 
have transcripts crediting 
them with taking courses they 
never completed. 

In the case of UCLA and 
Oregon, transcripts were 
discovered to have been 
forged . 

Known to be among the 19 
schools are Ottawa University 
of Kansas, Rocky Mountain 
College of Idaho and Los 
Angeles Valley College in Van 
Nuys.

WOOlen Get by 
Mesa in Tennis 

In classic tennis weather, 
the Triton Women's tennis 
team SQueezed past · the 
Mesa College team, 5·4, 
de.pite a major handicap. 
The # 1 singles player, 
Cecilia Kavanaugh, pulled 
the ligaments in her foot in a 
recent practice, thus forcing 
all of the players to play up 
one position. Coach Liz 
Dudash felt !laat that put a 
lot of extra pressure on the 
player •. 

Robin Da vi., the 
• ub.titute number one 
player, fell to her Mesa 
adversary, Melanie Ihrig, 
6.3, 6·1. Davis had lOme 
well placed shots and 
serves, but it wun't enough 
to hold off Ihrig, Her 
frustration with herself wu 
e.vident in her cries of 
"Corne on, Robin, What 
are you doing?" aher a 

milled or poorly executed 
shot. 

When asked if she had 
performed up to her full 
I!'tential, Davis responded, 
'No, I don't think I ever 
play up to my full 
potential. " 

Kavanaugh will be back 
on the courts in three weeks 
and all will be back to 
normal. Dudash attributes 
the slim margin of victory to 
a lack of practice time due 
to weather and the pressure 
of playing one levd up. She 
commented that "we 
should've beaten Mesa 
easier than we did." 

The Tritons next home 
matches are today with 
Point Lorna at 2 pm and 
Sunday with UC Riverside 
at 9 am at the Muir tennis

Triple Play Saves Tritoris 
8-4 Win Might Have Looked Very Different 

BY TIM LIon A 
Sport. Editor 

It's baseball's rarest and 
most exciting play. And yet 
the UCSD baseball team 
pulle<J one off Tuesday 
ahernoon against Point Loma 
College with such ease, it 
looked like they had practiced 
it for weeks. 

It's the triple play. 
With the bases loaded and 

nobody out , the Tritons 
leading 6·2, a hard grounder 
was hit to shortstop Mark 

Sharpe, He lielded it cleanly, 
flipped it to second baseman 
Rob Quiel, who fired to first for 
an apparent doubleplay. But a 
Point Lorna baserunner broke 
for the plate so Brian Kummer 
wheeled and fired to Triton 
catcher Jim Moffatt for the 
third out. Easy as one, two, 
three. 

The Tritons went on to win 
the game 8·4, For the Tritons 
it was their second win in a row 
on the road, giving them a 4·2 
mark on the season.

Ruggers Get Revenge 
On Occidental, }·3-7 

BY JOHN RUBENS 
1M UCSD Men's RUilby Club upset 

Occidental College last Saturday, 12·7. 
The Tritons 10K to Oxy earlier in the 
MUOn, 10 it was a crucial victory, 
perhaPl even a lucky one. In the fint half, 
Oxy acored a fieIcI.oaI on a penalty kick, 
takint an early 3-0 lead. 

Sui second·haII action saw the T ritona 
aIorm through the Occidental serum line 
for 12 points. Crai, Sanders outran the 
pac::k on a spectacular 6O.yard run for a 
try and the lead. Jeff Jones kick after was 
,ood, adding two poin" to the four.point 
try. Later, Jim Shetter scored on a 40· 
yard dash, followed by Jones' seCond 
aucceaaful conversion, completing the 
rugen' scorin, ~ve 01 12 poin". The 
Tritons gave up an Oxy try late in game, 
aHowinc the opposition 7 poin ... 

The Triton', ICrum kept hitting _low, 
"thwarting Oxy's serum offense." UCSD 
dominated Oxy in the early going, having 
the ball in their pollession a large part of 
the time on Oxy's half of the field. 

Oxy's large, experienced team became 
frustrated when it appeared UCSD was 
taking the game away. Though they were 
effectively cramping the Tritons' running 
style, they reportedly threw several 
blatant fis .. into blue and gold jerseys, 
sending tempera to the boiling point. 

UCSD missed a number of scoring 
opportunities .due to technical foul-upl 
such as c1qrnsy palling, and penalties that 
were a sign of rusty ball movement 
strategy. The Triton. definitely suffered 
from the exces.ively rainy season this """'.WIII~ 
winter, and having many new players on 
the squad (Dan Lopez, for example, was 
given a 10 minute "briefing" before taking 
the field) they are desperately hoping for 
sunny weather .

The Next Best Thing to Playing Jazz 
BY ERIC JAYE 

David Steinberg just can't 
seem to shake that itch to play 
jazz piano.

Steinberg Films 'Three Generations' of It 

He gave up his plans to 
pound the keyboard 
professionally after he got to 
UCSD because he didn't think 
he could make a living at it. 
Now Steinberg wants to be a 
filmmaker . 

night at the Unicom Cinema in 
La Jolla, he tells the story of 
three musicians, representing 
three generations in the 
evolution of jazz. 

Jazz was made to be shown to 
high school audiences. 
Steinberg says ~e did this 
because he wanted to provide 
the encouragement to high 
school musicians that he never 
got. But it certainly doesn't 
hurt the film's financial 
prospects any to already have 
a targeted market.

the making of the film, Walker 
Pearce, is lOunding out PBS, 
where she was recently 
employed. 

But just because Steinberg 
has some sense of what wiU

up churning out exploitation 
films for American Interna-

In an interview, the 
personable Steinberg, doem't 
sound stupid saying IOmething 
10 trite. Face to face, you get a 
feeling he actually believes 
that. And his film shows it.

" Okay," Steinberg laughs, 
"I know it's not that much 
more practical." 

Of course, it is certainly too 
early to tell if Steinberg, who 
will graduate from UCSD in 
the fall, actually has what it 
takes to support himself

problem. He wants to make 
films for a living, but he doesn't 
want to leave his jazz interest

Steinberg's solution; make a

practicing his art. But 
Sunday's screening showed 
that he has a good start. 

Although he claims it isn't 
10, Steinberg has already 
shown that he has some 
business 'ense, which he 
admits any filmmaker needs to 
hefty dose of to be successful . 

Steinberg distributed 
questionnaires to the 200 or so 
people at Sunday's screening 
and says the responses he got 
were "universally positive, 
especially from the teachers 
and musicians." 

Nor, Steinberg says, will he 
follow the lead of his 
professors in the Visual Arts 
department who churn out art 
films, and that is art with a 
capital A." 

Th~ee generations certainly 
couldn't be called art. And the 
pleasant little film wasn't out to 
exploit anyone. 

It tells, in a way that is just 
short of charming, the story of 
Earl, "Fatha" Hines, who is 
considered the father of jazz 
piano, Olarles McPhearson, 

And he has set out to do just 
that. In his first major film,

who is just starting out in the 
business. 

In his film Steinberg 
explores the practical siqe of 
the life of musicians, . and 
discUJses job opportunities 
and pay scales. 

And, true to his word, 
Steinberg's films give youpg 
musicians a good deal of 
encouragement to pursue a 
music career. 

Steinberg's next move, he 
says, is to New York for a .hot

on the Ie.. well known jazz 
musicians in that area who 
Steinberg believes have made 
a substantial contribution to 
the genre.
