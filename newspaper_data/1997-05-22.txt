Police Arrest Student for 
Keeping a Gun on Campus 
WEAPON: Semiautomatic 
pistol found in trunk of 
Douglas Lowery's car 
By Leena Shankar 
Staff Writer 

Campus police arrested Revelle fre hman 
Douglas Lowery la t Thursday for the posses-
sion of a firearm on a UC campus. Lowery was 
initially taken to the County Mental Hospital 
for evaluation as a po sible danger to himself 
or others, but was rejected and taken to the 
county jail. He has since been released on 
$5,000 bail. 

UC D police officer found an unloaded 
011 .38 semiautomatic gun in the trunk of 

Lowery 's car. after being alerted to its possible 
presence by Revelle Re ident Dean Kevin 
Jones. 

"I overheard some conversati on at Plaza 
Cafe , and that 's what started the whole situa-
tion," aid Jones. 

Citing confidentiality reasons, Jones would 
not elaborate on the incident. 

However, UCSD Police Detective Douglas 
O' Dell said the fact that Lowery posses cd a 
gun came to light because of comments he 
made to hi s roommate.

A.S. Rejects 
Committee's 
Suggestion 
BUDGET: Council moves 
CWD to general account, 
backers threaten recall election 
By Julia Kull~ader and Eric Brace 
Staff Writers 

Nearly 40 supporters of the Committee for 
World Democracy (CWO) watched the A.S. 
council approve a budget that for the fir t time 
will require CWO to ask for funding on a quar-
terly basi . 

The A.S. Finance Committee previously 
voted fiVe to two, with one senator abstaining, 
to fund WD through a line item in the A.S. 
executi ve budget. Line-item funding would 
allow CWD to receive all it money in a lump 
sum after the hudget is approved. 

A.S. Financial Controller Genoa Ferguson 
said President S uley Diallo and Vice President 
Finance Tony Fiori initially proposed to have 
CWO fu nded through the genera l student-orga-
nizations fund becau 'e WD is technically a 
. tudent organi zation. 

"It 's re-budgeting, the way it should have 
been budgeted in year 's pa t," rerguson said . 
"We only give line items to A.S. services and 
they are not an AS. service - CWO is a ' tu-
dent organization." 

Ferguson added that CWD would not have 
to ask for funding on a weekly ha i like other 
student organi zations because Diallo and Fiori 
recognize the group's hybrid status. 

"They are techn ically a student organiza-
tion. but si nce this counci l finds that they are a 
cross between a student organization and an 
AS . service, this proposal gives the money 
ahead of time," she said . 

Ferguson added that requiring WD to ask 
for funding on a quarterly basis is' not a form of 
censorship. 

"I feel like this wi ll in no way censor them," 
Ferguson said. " It will instead all ow the AS. to 
be more aware of where money is spent." 

Diallo echoed Fergu ~on 's concern that 
CWD ~hou ld not be the on ly student organiLa-
tion funded th rough a line item. 

"The value and integrity of WD a ' an 
organi zation is unquestioned," Diallo said . 
"The issue is very specilic - it is not an issue 
of accountability, it is an issue of equity." 

CWO member Paul Petrick said he was dis-
mayed by the council's vote, and added that the 
vote could have gone the other way if three sen-

DC Fee-Freeze Bill Clears Assembly Floor, Goes to Senate 
LEGISLAnON: UCSA 
claims bill could lock 
in future increases 
By Terry Lew 
News Editor 

AB 1318, a bill that would freeze 
UC, CSU and community college 
fees until the year 2000, moved a tep 
closer to becoming law Monday 
when it cleared the Assembly noor by 
a 48-20 vote. 

The bill , pon red by Lt. Gov. 
Gray Davis and A semblywoman 

Denise Moreno Ducheny, D-National 
City, would also limit future fee 
increase to the growth in per capita 
personal incomes. 

"I don't want the university to see 
students as a cash cow," Davis said. 

However, UC Student A sociation 
Legi lative and External Affairs 
Director Bo Thoreen said UCSA was 
wary of AB 1318 because personal-
income growth has outpaced the 
growth in actual purchasing power 
for the last 28 years. 

"If you' re on minimum wage, 
which doe n't go , up every year, 

you're seeing your purchasing power 
decrease," he said. 

Thoreen added that AB 13 18 does 
not address the university's need for 
continued funding, nor the fact that 
such funding the money has to come 
from somewhere. 

"The UC administration has 
admitted to this - if the money does 
not come from the late, il has to 
come from tudents," he aid. "We 
are the last elastic funding source." 

Thoreen said U A uppon AB 
1415, a bill by Assembly Speaker 
Cruz Bustamante, D-Fresno, which 

would guarantee the university the 
previous year's share of the state's 
budget. It would also guarantee an 
increase corresponding with the 
growth in personal income , as well 
as an increase to account for enroll-
ment growth. 

If fee increases ever became nec-
e 'sary, AS 1415 would limit them to 
the annual growth in incomes. 

"This would, if everything goo 
perfectly, lock the fee level at 1997 
indefinitely," Thoreen said. " It actual-
ly tarts to make the University more 
accessible and more affordable."

Chemist Named to Medical Institute 
UCSD Chemistry Professor Susan Taylor was one 

of 70 scientists selected through a national competi· 
tion to be an investigator with the Howard Hughes 
Medical Institute, The institute is the largest philan-
thropiC organization in the United States. 

For the past several years, Taylor and her col· 
leagues have studied a family of regulatory enzymes 
called protein kinases, 

The faulty regulation of kinases has been linked to 
several diseases, including diabetes , cancer, 
Alzheimer 's disease and Lou Gehrig's disease, 

Taylor's research has shed light on the possible

A.S. Budget Priorities Are 
Heading in Right Direction 

After hours of debate, the A .S . • ouncil Finance 
ommi ttee brought its recommendati o ns for the 1997-

199R A.S. budget hefore the full council last ni ght. With 
more than $700,000 at its disposal. the new counci l faced 
c rucial budget decisions that will affect many segments 
of the student body. 

One proposal - introduced to the linance committee 
by A.S . President Sou ley Diallo and Vice President-
Fi nance Tony Fiori and still under consideral ion by the 
full counci l - would eliminate stipends for A .S. senators. 
U nder the pi'oposal. the senator-st ipend money would be 
used to raise the s tipends or executive officers, such as 
Diallo and Fiori, by 40 percent. For e;:xecutive coun-
ci lmembers to attempt to raise their own salaries immedi-
ately upon taki ng office is ludicrous. much less by this 
ridiGulously hi gh percentage. Such a self-serving action is 
clearly not in the best interest of t~e student body. 

Despite thi s concern, we applaud the counci l 's deci -
sion to increase funding for programming and student -
organizations - 20 percent and 15 percent. respectively. 
Many students will benefit directly from money spent in 
these areas. Such increases are the most expedient way to 
improve the quality of UCSD's campus life. 

The cou ncil also made a good decision not to fund 
SlUdent Cable Works (SeW) throug h the Grove Caffe's 
Mandated Reserves fund. While enough money may cur-
rently be;: avai lab le to fund sew in this way. the fund 
will eventuall y run out. As the only venue for ue D stu-
dents to gain experience in broadcast media, S W is an 
important campus resource and should be funded through . 
~tudent -activily fees .

WHY I RESPECTFULLY 
DISAGREE WITH CLINTON 

COMMENTARY: Although it's an honor to have the president speak 
at one's graduation, that doe 'n 't mean it's wrong to criticize him 

Nat e 
PIETILA 

Rl'sidelll 
GO{(f/y 

OK, I' ll admit il : As a gradu-
aling senior. I wa, very pleased 
when I first heard Ihat Pre~idcnl 
Clinton would be ~peakln g al 
graduation on June 14. I'm ~Iill 
really Jaued ahout 11 . 

Regular reader. of Ihl . w l-
umn, knOWing thai I' ve ne ver

prc.,ldcnt 
and thc first 
lady when 
C lr CUIn -

~tances war-
ranted, might he shocked at this 
rcvelatlon. However. there is no 
denying thai it is a rare honor to 
have the leadcr of Ihe frce world 
deliver a speech during your com-
mencement ceremony. Gradualion 
day will be that Illuch more melno-
rahlc ror IllC . 

do say Ihis are unJus:~ liahly opposed 10 Ideological COIll-
milmenl or any kind . 

The new ol1hodox y IS an ani i-ideology idcology. BUI 
thl ~ untl-ldeological stance IS itself a manifestation of 
how our ~oc i e t y has Occome so much more disagree-
ahle. II IS eminently disagreeahle to charge someone 
who dl>ag ree~ wllh you with being disagreeable. 

So I ask you, dear reader: Would it be bad fonn for 
me to trIticll.e the pr,,~idcntillthi s column knowing that 

he will he speaki ng at my gradu a-
tion '! Would it be disagreeahle for 
me to criticize him so cln e to his 
arri vaJ'l The answer, quite simply, is 
no - if, of course. my cri ticism~ 
were olTered in good faith . 

So I'm going to disagree with the 
president when he and his allies try 
to di miss hi s current legal diOicul-
ties as merely the products of a par-
tisan witch hunt directed by the 
GOP. 

I'm exci ted about graduation; 
and ~o were Illy parents - that is, 
until they heard who our guest 
speaker was going to be. 

"Guess what'!" I asked my 
father exci tedly over the telephone. 
"Clinton 's going to be speaking at 
my comlllenCelllCI!t ceremony!" 

"Oh," he said. ''Then I guess I'll 
ha ve a chance to ask hi III some 
questions about Whitewaler and 
Vince Foster." 

I'm going to disagree 
with the president 
when he and his 
aille. try to dismiss 
his current legal 
dlfflcultle. _ 

One distincti ve aspect of the 
American legal system is Ihat it is 
based On Ihe premise that law 
should be about more than just poli-
lies. Our political tradition has long 
been wmmitted to the idea that our 
polity should be governed by the 
rule of law - nol by the arbitrary 
wills of men (or women). 

In America, this wmmitment has 
manifested itse lf in the separation of 
powers. where the legislature makes 
the laws, the executi ve enforces the 
laws and the judiciary applies and 
interprels Ihe laws. If all power were

was: tepid at hest. non-existent at w(ml. 
Was I di sappoinled at their reaclion'! I think "puz-

zled" is a heller word. While it is true that I hail from 
Repuhlican-stronghold Orange County, I thought that 
their response would have been more positive. My par-
ents vote regularly, and arc fairly conservative. but will 
their politics ohscure for them the honor of having 
POTU 'peak at their son's graduation') I hope no\. 

M;I he my parenls' reaction IS an IndlCalion of how 
we, as a society. have lo~tthc anility to di agree wllhllut

(Ole) is to create "a microcosm of 
the Juslice Department," taffed 
by career prosecutors who are 
both Democrats and Republicans. 
Shortly after hi s announcement 
earlier this year Ihat he intended to 
leave the investigation by Aug. I 
(a decision he later came to regret 
and was forced 10 rescind ), Starr 
asscrted that the OIC was not 
"Ken's shop" but a "law shop," 

Starr believes deeply that law 
can, and should, be apolitical. He 
didn't view him~e lf as a political 
ligure when he made this state-
ment - and rightly so. Starr 
knows that his job is to prosecute 
people ba ed on evidence of i lie-
gal activity, and nOlhi ng more. 

I'm not blaming Pre ident 
Clinton for resenting Slarr's IIlves-
tigation. Clinton might be entirely 
innocent of any wrongdoing; any 
one of us who was under investi-

in favor of having a line item liJr 
CWD at the cC'mmiltee meeting . 

"1 don ' t even reall y know what 
to ,ay," Petm:k ~aid . "The sad part 
i, that we had the votes and the 
peopk: that "ere on our \Ide Ju,t 
didn ' t ,how up:' 

"But on lOp of that , I thlllk then: 
were a lot of fabe fael'> spread 
around certain issues like aCl:()unt-
ability and the pretense that we 
shou ld he treated like other stu dent 
organll.ations ," he addcd . 
"Unfortunately. I thin k a lot of 
those Jrgurnents deal in suhtleties 
that are ha rd to get across ina 
three-mi nute speech ," 

Petrick said he has di,cussed the 
pos~ l h l it y of a reca ll election wi th 
M:vera l othcr d"gruntkd stu dents, 

'There arc differe nt organi/a-
tions that are relati ve ly unhappy 
wi th the way thi s council is go ing," 
Petrick said, "I think that people 
are son of pl ay ing wllh the idea of 
a recalL" 

Art icle V, Sec ti on E of thc 
ASUCSD Con~ t i tu ti()n states th at 
any officer may he recalh.:d if at 
IcaM 10 perecnt of the , tudent hody 
presents a signed petition de mand-
ing his Impcachmcnt. 

The counci l then has 111 acade-
mic days to hold a rel:a ll ekction. If 
two-third, of the votcs wcre in 
favor of impeachmen t. the onil:cr 
wou Id he removed. 

As of fa ll quart er, therc were 
14,623 enrolled undergraduates. 

According to Petnc k, 2.295 stu-
dent s signed a peti ti on tu make 
CWD a line item. However. he ~aid 
the A.S. counci l sec med to hc ind if-
ferent when hc prescnted the signa-
tures. 

"I th ink that is ind i(ati v.: of thi s 
council not spending the time to he 
aware of what the people out there 
think and what the students think ," 
he said . 

Later in the meeting, Diallo pre-
sented his proposal to fund the 
$23,658 Student Cable Works 
(SCW) operations budget from the 
Grove Caffe mandaled-reservcs 
account. The reserves consist of 
surplus income generated from the 
Grove Caffe. Soft Reserves and 
A.S. Leclure NOles. 

However, SCW General 
Manager Alex Thiesen said such an 
action i~ dangerous hecause it 
depends upon an unstable sour(e of 
funding. 

"Our primary com:erns arc th c 
re lative un pred lctahility of the 
ann ual n:venuc hrought into the

The flamenCO-influenced Gipsy Kings 
come to Hospitality Point tomorrow night 

The Gipsy Kings are a one-of-a kind musical act. They have never fol -lowed musical trends and rarely get much radio play or hype from 
the press and (hey don ' ( even speak 
Engli sh. Yet over the past 
decade. the Gipsy Kings, who 
perform tomorrow at Hospital -
ity Point. havt! become Ameri -
ca's biggest-selling French act 
t! ver. selli ng million s of 
albums both here and abroad. 
They have accompli shed thi s 

~ impl y by performin g and 
recording thei r unique brand of fla -
menco-influenced music, which has 
appan::ntl y tran scended both the lan-
guage barri ers and the fads. 

The mu sic th at has made the band 
~o successful is difricult to desc ribe, 
because it defi es any categori zation 
bey nd "World Music." Even "Latin 
Pop" would be a stretch, because 
frontman Ni colas Reyes doe ' not sing 
in pan ish, but rather the Gyp y 
dialect of Gifalle. Their musical style, 

which some call "Rumba Flamenco," 
is not quite flamenco, rock or pop, but 
does reflect aspects of all three. 

The unique sound stems from the 
Gipsy Kings' eclectic ethnic back-

ground, which features Span-
ish, French and North African 
influences. It is characterized 
by multi -layered acousti c gui -
tars, a strong Latin rhythm and 
Reyes ' distinctive singing. But 
however difficult it Illay be to 
describe the band's music, one 
Illerely needs to li sten to it in 

order to understand it. 
It~ most recent album, the gold-ce rti -

ried The BeSf of fh e Gipsy Kings, is an 
exce llent refl ection of the band's capa-
bil ities and styles. Included, of course, 
are the group ' most well -known songs, 
such as "Djobi , Djoba," "Bern , Bern, 
Maria" and "Bamboleo." Also on the 
album are heartfelt instrumentals like 
"Love and Liberte" and "Moorea."

BUCK-O-NINE GETS DOWN 
San Diego band celebrates new album release 
By Scott Yager 
Staff Writer 

The chorus to the title track of 
Buck·O·Ninc's ncwcst relea e, 
Twenty·Eight Teeth, asks, " What 
keeps me hangin' on?" For the 
band members, the answer is their 
love of music and the excitement of 
presenting their mix of ska, punk 
and reggae to the publi c. 

Add 10 this excitcment the thrill 
of playing in Ihe band's hometown 
in front of rabid fans, and you can 
picture the scene at SOMA Live 
last Friday night. A sellout crowd 
gathered to weicolllc back local 
ska-hero Buck·O-Ninc for its CD 
rclease party. Considering that the 
band's last area appearance was on 
New Ycar's Evc, and forgetting the 
brokcn air·conditioncrs, the audi-
ence was primed for an unforget-
table evening.

What a value: San Diego's local heroes Buck-O-Nine celebrated the 
release of Twenty-Eight Teeth with a concert at SOMA last Friday. 

Thc band certainly delivered on audience members energy and spit

proved that he \\las quite a do-it-
yourself-musician by writing and 
performing vinually everything on 
Foo Fighter " debut album in 1995. 
For the band'ssecond release, Tlte 
Colollr & Tlte Shape. Grohl ha~ 
included the input or hi ~ band-
mates- guitarISt Pat m~ar, and 
bassist Nate Mendel- Imlking the 
new record more of a band erfon 
than the previous solo project. 

The album opens with a light 
ballad, "Doll." and then shifts gear~ 
into the high-speed, high-energy 
mani a of the band 's first single , 
"Monkey Wrench." Many of the 

GIPSY: 
French group comec

Continued from page 11

The Gi psy Kings arc one of the 
few hands that really arc good 
enough in concert to de~ervc a 
Ilvc alhu m. The demand \\I'" ,n

hut they pla y that , tyle very well , 
which is what make;, the band su 
interesting to ~ee li ve. The 
group 's several guitari st;,. most Iy 
Reyes' COU;,lm, provide an essen-
tial e lement to the sound . 130th 
th e vigo rou ~ strumming and 
lightning -fa ;,t riamenc(l run s 
reveal tru e talent and musical 
command. 

Reyes' characteri tic and 
expressive voice is probably the 
band's most distinguishable trait. 
His heartfelt Iyncs usually deal 
with love, often of hi s love for the 
band 's homeland in the south of 
France. The band 's Latin percus-
sion secti on is also indispensable, 
gi ving the music a rhythmi c, syn-
copated feel. 

Tomorrow's concert at Hospi-
tality Point will kick ofT the North 
American leg of the Gipsy Kings' 
summer tour. Much of the mu~i c 
performed will probably be from 
Tlte Best of the Gips" Kings. 
although the band has a total of 
seven albums from whi ch 10 draw 
material from. not including the 
possibility of some brand-new 

llIu ~ic . 
In the /11u,i c world. with /I;, 

short -hved trend, and temporary 
popularity, It is extremely uplifting 
to ~ee a quality band like the GIP~) 
Kin g." which ha~ made it tn the top 
Ju,t hy working hard and dOll1g 1/\ 
0\, n thll1g 

songs manage to produce catchy 
melodies due to the unconventional 
chord progressions - undeniably 
the late Kurt Cobain 's influence on 
Grohl. References to Cobain can be 
found throughout the album, par-
ticularly in "February Stars" a 
Grohl sings, '" watched you come 
and go. How was I to know you'd 
steal the how?" At times, Grohl 
seems to be dealing wi th the pass-
ing ofCobain in his lyrics, but he is 
still unwilling to share hi s feelings 
with the public. As he proclaims in 
the final song. "I'll never tell you 
the secret s I'm holding."

- Daniel Lee 

La~t year, heavy metal legend 
and old-timer Ozzy Osbourne 
ended hi s shon-lived retirement by 
forming a new band and recording 
O;:::'/lwsis. He then rou nded up nine 
of his favorite bands. including 
Slayer and Sepultura, and toured 
the country. The result is O::.z Fes/ 

Live. a sampling of each band 
recorded on the road. The album 
renects a broad cross-sect ion of 
today 's metal scene. including both 
up-and-coming acts such a Earth 
Crisis and Coal Chamber and more 
established bands like Fear Factory 
and Biohazard. 

Of the newer, "second-stage" 
band on 0:;: Fest Live, Coal 
Chamber shows the 1110st promise, 
as demon trated by its energetic, 
Sepultura-like track, "Loco." The 
hand Powerman 5000 attempt a 
funky/thrashy aproaeh, while Cel-
lophane is the 1110st punk-like of 
the bands. 

Also along for the ride is euro-
sis. with it s nihilist, noi~y hrand of 
metal. BlOhalard delivers a solid. 
heavy showing with its track, 
"These Eyes." and Fear Factory. 
probably the most underrated band 
on the alhum, performs "Replica ," 
one of the strongest tunes. 

Headliners Sepultura and Slayer 
give command performances, as 
usual. Sepultura play, "Allitute," 
from its most recent offering. Roots. 
"Atti tute showcases the Brazilians 
at their best. complete with Latin 

percussion intro and thrashy riffage. 
Slayer whip up the audience with 
its classic and cherished old chest-
nut. "Angel oI' Death." 

However, Osbourne's only mis-
take in organizi ng the tour was 
putting himself lasl. The album\ 
last track. "Perry Mason." original-
ly from O:':.!IIosis. shows that Ozzy 
i still the same showman he was 25 
years ago, but Slayer and Sepultura 
are very tough acts to follow. OZ7.y 
gets credit for trying, though. Watch 
for the "On-Fest" this fall, which i 
rumored to involve Pantera and 
Type 0 egati ve, among others.

With Speedy J's (u.k .a. Jochem 
Paap) third release, Pllhlic Eller!:.\' 
No. I. the Rotterdam. Holl and. 
native takes his li steners on an aural 
trip usually reserved for tho e hear-
ing voice, in their hcad~ . Differing 
from his prcviou~ house/cluh/"hi-

RG" style, this album is considcr-

KAPLAN 
1-800-KAP-TEST 

www.kaplan.com 

ably stripped down from peedy 1's 
previous efforts. 

Nowhere will you find a dance-
able beat or a catchy tune - and 
absolutely nowhere can you take 
solace in hi s music. The distoned 
analog crunch with minimalist 
overtones takes listeners through 
the arti t's head, and perhap open 
a new door for electronic I11U ic. 

Public Energy No. J plays out 
like a walk in a Iwi ted fore t, 
where none of the sounds correlate 
to nature and the trees and bushes 
keep moving towa rd you. This 
album is definitely not easy listen-
ing and will require the listcner to 
open hi s mind . So strap in and let 
Speedy J take you for a ride.

GIANTS: Bay 
Area is believing 
Continued from page 20 
bunch of up-and-comers, has-
been and never-we res arc 
taki ng the fie ld, 

Just a fe w starters have 
ever ba tted over .300, and 
The Giants 
have only one guy who has hit 
over 30 hombs or swiped over 
30 hases in a sing le season , 
Mark Ga rdn er i ~ th e only 
pitcher to have won as many as 
10 games in a season, and he's 
hard ly an All -Star. Yet despitc 
not havi ng many proven pl ay -
ers, the boys fro m the Bay are 
making some serious noise. 

After a loss to the Rm:kies 
ye terday, the Giants arc sti II at 
25- 18, good enough for ri rst in 
a competitive div ision. Thei r 
road record is second onl y to 
the Bra yes, and their early nine-
game winning streak has been 
the longest in the majors thi 
season, All this despite middle-
of- the-pack numbers from both 
their pitching and hitting. 

At weeks' end, they ra nked 
scventh in pitching and 10th in 
hillin g among the Na t io nal 
League squads, and yet they 
have the th ird -be st rel:ord 
among those teams. How are 
they doing it? 

The detractors might ~ay that 
thi s success is due to luck. an 
easy s!: hedule or he!:ause other 
teams aren' t taking them se ri -
ous ly, Being horn and bred in 
the Bay, of course I have an -
other view. 

A major reason is because 
the Giants are wi nni ng a lot of 
close games. They're coming 
from hehind to win games, 
they're doing we ll in extra in-
nings and they' re holdin g the 
leads their hitters do earn . 

Rod Beck has returned to 
the form or yesteryear, lead ing 
the league with 15 saves and 
showing great w ntrol to the 
tunc of two walks on the sea-
son. Yes, these trends are in-
dica ti ve of a good bullpen, but 
there is someth ing larger at 
work here. The Giants have 
round the raith . 

Where there's a wi II , there's 
a way, and the Giant s have wi 11 -
power. This team of free -agent 
flunk ies and farm-league fresh-
men wants to win games, and 
they believe they have the abil -
ity to do it. 

By winnin g a lot of 
squeakers, they've shown the 
charac te r and kn ow- how it 
takes to win tough ga illes and 
avoid mi stakes in the clutch. 

Behind what is one of the 
top-no tch bull pen s in the 
league, they've been earning 
their tooth-and-nail vic tori es 
and bu ilding l:onfidcnl:c all the 
while. I'm not goi ng to be the 
one to te ll them they' re not re-
all y th at good, and nei ther is 
Dusty Baker. 

So here 's a lesson to those 
depressed Padre backers. Men-
tal preparati on and momentum 
arc a big part of basehall , and it

Shabel and Becker Ousted 
NATIONALS: Steve Shabel and Ben Becker suffered tough first-round 
losses on Monday at the Division III Men' Tennis National Championship 
By Travis Hili 
Co-Associate Sports Editor 

For one pl ayer, it was the end 
of a great career. For the o ther, it 
was mere ly a pause 
in a promisi ng begi n-
ning. cni or main -
stay Ben Becker and 
sophomore sen 'ation 
Steve Shabe l com-
peted on the campus 
of Washington and 
Lee Unive rsit y on 
Mo nd ay in the 
NCAA Divis ion III 
Men's Tennis Cham -
pionships. 

The doubles competit ion was 
Becker's fin al run at a champion-
ship. It was Shabel ' s first trip to an 
NCAA ational tournament , and , 
in addition to the doubles bracket, 
he also competed in the singles 
tournament. While both players 
gave tremendous effort s, UCSD 
suffered first-round defeat in both 
singles and doubles. 

In the fi rst round of the si ngles 
tournament, Shabe l began the ti tle 
hunt for the Tritons as he faced off 
agai nst Bob Hehli of Wi sconsi n-

La Crosse ni ver-
s it y. T he Tri to n 
sophomore began the 
biggest match of the 
season with a bang, 
dominating the fi r t 
set. 

He overwhelmed 
Hehli 6-2 in the opcn -
i ng set. but Helhi did 
not let it get to him. In 
fac t. he turned things 

around on the young Triton. 
Hehli began toopen up hi s game, 

pinpointing spots all over the court. 
The second set was a complete re -
versal of the opener, as Hehl i evened 
up the match by defeating Shabcl. 6-
2. 

In the final set, both players 
knew what the stakes were and 
went af't er each other. The final set 
was a war, and both players fought 

va liantly. In the end, they were 
fo rced to go to the ti c-breaker. It 
was then thai Hehl i finall y over-
came the Tritons No.1 si ng les 
pl aye r, 7-6 (7 -3). 

Afte r the heartbreaking loss, 
Shabeljoi ned Becker for thei r fi rst-
round meeting wi th Nathan Bell 
and Doug Neag le or Salisbury 
State. UCSD 's 0 . 1 tandem with 
a 10-6 record, ra n into stiff com-
petili on from the Bell - eag le 
team. 

In the fir t set, the battle raged 
as both -ides de perately tried to 
get the crucial first-set victory . 
Like Shabel' s fin al si ngles set, this 
one was forced into a tic-breaker. 
Unfortunately, the result also fol-
lowed suit from Shabel' s match as 
UCSD fe ll , 7-6 (7-5). 

In the second set, the exhausled 
Triton duo left everything on the 
court in an allcmpt to get back into 
the match. However, they could not 
overcome Bell and Neagle, and fell 
6-3.

The Padres have problem~ . I 
hear the griping from grocery 
\tore clerks, my harber and my 
cohorts around campus. 

Everyone'~ moaning about the 
Pad'~ demise, and it 's my duty 
as your intrepid reporler to 
explain il. 

The reasons arc many. For 
starters, the Friars did nothing 
in the offseason. They let a 
good quad sit pat, while 
competi tors improved their 
roster . Quilvio Veras has been 
lillie improvement over Jody 
Reed, and the Padres still have 
no legitimate leadoff hiller. To 
make mailers worse, they still 
haven ' t been able to pull the 
string on a deal involving 
Rickey Henderson. 

Injuries have hit this aged 
squad in all the places that 
stayed healthy la t year. 
Whether the boys were 
downing too much reatine 
and tress ing out the tendons or 
Father Time has just caught up, 
the pile of injuries keeps 
grow ing. 

As a result , those players 
staying healthy are trying too 
hard to make up for those 
absenl. Relaxing is important 
to effective hilling, and it is 
obvious that Veras, reg 
Vaughn, Ken Caminiti and the 
others have been stres 'ing at 
the plate. Despite a brilliant 
preseason, the Padres appear to 
be keeping the faith some-
where outside the ci ty limits; 
maybe it's still down in 
Arizona. 

I also have another idea. 
The winning spi rit that was so 
vibrant last year has migrated 
nOrlhward. No, not to the land 
of Dodger blues, where five 
straight Rookies of the Year 
and the best all -around staff in 
baseball can barely scrape 
above .500. I'm talking about 
Frisco, a bargain-basement. no-
talent team that 's taking it to 
the rest of the National Le,lgue. 

This team is middle or the 
pack by every dclinition. The 
payroll is minimal, and looking 
at this roster against the 
stacked clubs like the Braves 
and Marlins send!; a chi ll like 
the andlestick winds down 
my spine. 

Gone are the big-name 
players of a few years back. 
Big dogs like John Burkell, 
Bill Swift, Will Clark, Mall 
Wi lliams and Royce Clayton 
have gone where the payrolls 
are thicker. Nowadays, a bunch 
of up-and-comers, has-beens 
and never-weres arc taking the

Pride. Random House defines the 
term as "dignified self-respect and 
gratification arising from one's ac-
comp li shm ent or 
possessions."The av-
erage UCSD ~tudent 
might take pride in 
good grades, a fami Iy 
member's achieve-
ments or the abi lity to 
ou tdrink his or her 
sui temates on a Fri-
day night. 

However, for the 
SD crew squads, 

pride comes from compet i ng agai nst 
the odds and improving on the pre-
vious year's accompli shments. The 
men's ~quad, under first-year head 
coach Mike Fillipone, improved 
great I yin the 1996-1997 season. 
Early on, the Triton found the go-
ing tough, losi ng to other squad . . B 
boats. But their determination and 
hard work started to pay dividends 
as the season wore on. 

The Tritons finished their season 
at the Pacific Coast Rowing ham-
pionships. held at Lake Natoma. 
this past weekend. The UC 0 var-
si ty-eight squad grabbed a bronze 
medal for its third-place showing in 
aturday' We tern Intercollegiate 

Rowing Association race. This raj.:c 
excluded Pac 10 schools like UCLA 
and UC Berkeley, but included tough 

competition like rowing-power-
house Orange Coast College (New-
port Beach ) and the UC Davis 
Aggies . 

"A ll the g uy ~ had fire and 
heart ," senior Karim 
Rafaat said . "Con-
sidering the number 
of people lnine 
U SO athletes com-
pared to 25 -30 on 
other sq uad s], we 
had a phenomenal 
season . Mike 
[Fillipone] has done 
a fantastic job. Ev-
eryone looks up to 

him and he put in a lot of work on 
the boat. " 

trong head winds that favored 
the bigger boats coupled with a 
strong performance from Orange 
Coast gave 0 the victory in the 
Varsity-eight. The Aggies followed 
behind in second place. 

"We were very excited about 
the possihility of winning ," 
Fillipone said . " We 've been real 
close to everyone all eason long. 
But Orange Coast has a well -es-
tablishedpr gram-well-funded, 
and with full -time coaches. Ear-
lier in the yearwe finishedju tone 
second behind them, so we knew 
we could beat them. We raced real 
well [on Saturday] but we could 
not quite beat them. They were 
just too strong." 

Captain and stroke ore Sam 
Nichol led this year's varsity-eight 
squad, with Rafaat and other sup-
plying the power. UCSD wa tough 
competition all year, after a rough 
start in the fall of 1996. 

"Even though we didn't do as 
well in the fall. everybody kept 
working hard," Fillipone said. "The 
athletes were determined to make 
UCSD rowing recognized on cam-
pus." 

UC D's rowing squads have 
gone through some change ' in the 
past couple of years. Last year, the 
Triton did not even field a varsity 

squad . Thi ' seaso n, however, 
Fillipone has the luxury of 18 nov-
ice athletes coming back next sea-
son. This large crop of young ath-
lete will be the backbone for future 
team to come. 

" It took a lot of perseverance for 
us to [rebound) from our early sea-
son problem ," Rafaat said. "We 
went from a team that lost to B boats 
to one of the most feared boals on 
the water." 

"The players are the ones who 
are in the boat and doing the work, 
they deserve the [credit)." Fillipone 
said.
