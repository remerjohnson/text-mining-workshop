Students Protest 
Future Pub Closure 
By M. O'KEEFE 
Contributing Writer 

The Triton Pub's replacement 
by a pub under the management 
of Round Table Pizza at the new 
Price Center will be one con-
equence of the Center' grand 

opening next quarter .. 
When the students were sur-

veyed several years ago by the 
administration as to what type of 
eating establishment they would 
like to have in the new student 
center, the overwhelming re-
sponse was " pizza and beer." 

said that this is all the University 
can do about changing the current 
alcohol policy. 

"The University has no say over 
who gets the license," Weisenfeld 
said, explaining that the license 
will be given to the highest bidder. 

Weisenfeld felt that students 
would not be trongly opposed 
to the clo ing of the Pub if they 
had a better under tanding of 
what the new Round Table Pizza 
wa going to be like. 

VOLUME 65, #15 o 

What mo t students did not 
realize wa that the existence of a 
new beer and pizza place meant 
the end of the Triton Pub. Sev-
eral students have claimed that 
the response may have been dif-
ferent had the question been 
asked, "Which would you prefer, 
Round Table or the Pub?" 

Round Table Pizza wiU accom-
modate 150 to 200 more people 
than the Pub. It will feature live 
bands, a large screen TV and 
weekly comedy nights .. 

"The new owners are eager to 
satisfy the wants of the campus," 
Weisenfeld said. 

All Tapped Out - The Triton Pub is scheduled to close next quarter with the completion of the new 
University Center. A new pub will open at the Center under the management of Round Table Pizza. 

Weisenfeld predicted that, after 
it closes, the Pub "will be another 
opportunity, or space, for par-
ties ." 

The Pub will then be run by 
the University Center Board, and 
wiU be made available for use by 
student organizations. 

Mary Ann Davis, "someone who 
cares," changes. 

There are some students who 
feel that keeping the Pu b is worth 
going through the bureaucratic 
process to set a policy change in 
motion. 

refers to as "Day at the Pub," 
which he is hoping to organize as 
a gathering of 6,000 student at 
the Pub to show support during 
the second week of winter quar-
ter. 

Brown is also interested in 
planning a "Save the Pub" con-
cert (as a fundraiser) and encour-
ages students to contact him if 

they are interested in participat-
ing. 

Davis appreciates students' 
efforts to save her nine-year-old 
business. 

"I think it's great what the kids 
are doing ... It's a boost fo:- my 
ego , but frankly, I think that 
they're banging their head a-
gainst a waU," she said. 

According to one A.S. mem-
ber, the Pub was given the first 
priority over outside investors to 
move to the slot allowed in the 
new student center. Apparently, 
however, this was not "economi-
cally feasible" for the Pub's 
owners. 

Due to the California State 
Alcohol and Beverage Commis-
sion's policy, which aUows for 
only one liquor license on the 
UCSD campus, the A.S. member 
stated that the Pub's options 
were basicaUy, "Move or die." 

Alcohol will still be aU owed to 
be served at private parties if 
reservations are made in advance 
and students comply with U ni-
versity alcohol policy guideline . 

Many students feel that the 
Pub will not be the same under 
the authority of the administra-
tion. 

One such student i lacrosee 
team member Joe Brown, who 
feels that, "The Pub has been 
good for us and in return we 
want to do something for them. " 

He has organized petitions 
which wiU be circulating in the 
ReveUe Plaza area during the 
ninth week of faU quarter and i 
hoping to Â·get at least 25 percent 
of the students to support his 
efforts. 

A.S. Rights Bill Passes 

Chairperson of the University 
Center Board, Evan Weisenfeld , 
said that, "If the students show a 
real demand to save the Pub, 
we 11 send the paper work through 
the ABC [the Alcoholic Bev-
erage Commission]." He also 

"Making [the Pub] a part of 
campus defeats [its] purpose," 
said one student, who remarked 
that dealing with the administra-
tion to throw a party there would 
be a "total hassle." 

Another student feared that 
the Pub would lose its personal 
atmosphere ifits ownership under 

In addition to petitions, Brown 
is also planning to sell "Save the 
Pub" T-shirts. Brown said that 
T-shirts wiU be on sale next 
week.

sales will go toward what Brown

Scripps Plays Role in Global Climate Study 
By LOREN CHEN 
Contributing Writer 

On October 21, the Scripp Institute of 
Oceanography announced that it will be col-
laborating with Los Alamos and Lawrence 
Livermore National Laboratories on a 
scientific study of the Earth's changing 
climate. 

This four-year project, which wiU exam-
ine the oceans and atmo phere, came about 
through the efforts of the University of Cali-
fornia's In titutional Collaborative Research 
Program. 

Thi program encourages the UC system 
and UC-managed Department of Energy 
lab to work together in u eful long-term 
re earch. 

The $800,000 program will utilize super-
computing power from these institute a 
well as their knowledge of complex math-
ematical programs on climate modelling, 
global atmospheric chemistry and the rate 

of climatic change. 
Said C.F." hick" Keller, director of the 

Los Alamo Branch of the UC's In titute of 
Geophy ic and Planetary Phy ic , "The 
problems posed by tudies of the global cli-
mate mu t be resolved by large concentrated 
research effort." 

hiatus 

This program will combine enormous 
computing ability with expertise in simulat-
ing the natural :!nvironment. The UC's uni-
que structure of interacting campuses and 
laboratories puts it in a particularly trong 
position to do this research," Keller said. 

"Since a wide range of interactive pro-
cesses - in the atmo phere, the ocean, the 
ice caps, the olid earth, and the biosphere 
- contribute to climate change, the prob-
lem mu t be attacked by considering Earth 
as a unified system," Edward A. Frieman, 
director of Scripp Institution of Oceano-
graphy, and the tudy's principal 
inve tigator, added . 

"This project will greatly improve under-
standing Of the proces e crucial to global 
climate change by combining the intellectual 
and conceptual re ources of the e three 
research centers and other C campuses," 
Frieman aid .

UCLA Fraternity May Lose Recognition 
Because of Pending Lawsuit 

LOS ANGELES - Litigation of a million-dollar 
law suit against Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity and the 
University is pending a settlement to be negotiated next 
week . 

UCLA student Michael O'Hare is uing Lambda Chi 
for damages incurred from head injuries he received 
during a fight between Lambda Chi and Zeta Psi last 
spring break. The head injury also postponed O'Hare's 
graduation until this quarter. 

O'Hare, then a boarder at Zeta Psi, decided to sue 
the fraternity when it refused to release the name of its 
insurers. He is also sui ng UCLA on the grounds of 
" breach of contract and of negligence," said Andrew 
Levy, legal intern for Robert Hindin, who is represent-
ing O'Hare. O'Hare feels the university is responsible 
for the fraternity's actions, Levy said. 

If the company does not agree to the terms or if they 
do not reach a settlement, the case will be litigated, 
Levy said . 

Lambda Chi 's reluctance to provide information may 
also cost them official recognition. 

Although Lambda Chi did not release the informa-
tion to the univer ity, they will have to if they want 
renewed official recognition from the university.

U C Irvine Biology Students 
Retake Midterm Exam 

IRVIN E - About 100 students had to retake their 
biology midterm exam last week after professor disco-
vered that the original test may have been for sale 
beforehand. 

Associate Professor of molecular biology and bio-
chemistry Micheal Cumsky said the original exam for 
Biological Sciences 144 had been gradt'd and handed 
back to st udents when a secretary in the departmental 
office received an anonymous phone tip that the exam 
was up for sale. 

The call disturbed Cumsky and the other instructor 
for the class, Assistant Professor Charles Glabe, who 
found the original tests missi ng on the day of the exam 
two weeks ago. 

Glabe said hc had new exams printed and then 
administered them becau e he assumed the tests had 
been misplaced or accidentally thrown away, not 
stolen. 

After receiving news of the phone call. Cum ky said 
he asked his class whether anyone had been offered a 
midterm but so far no one has come forward . 

Both professors conceded that the phone call may 
have been a ruse, but a new test was administered any-
way because W we can't ignore someone making an alle-
gation," Glabe said . - Larry 'olan, New University

Isla Vista Halloween Weekend 
Not as Big as Last Year 

SANTA BARBARA - Less than half as many 
people in Isla Vista were arrested and cited during this 
year's four-day Halloween weekend , as compared to 
the two-day festivals of last year, and no major inci-
dents occurred, according to police reports. 

By the time this year-'s costumes were shed, police 
had cited and arrested 462 persons, with 110 of them 
booked into jail - most of these offenses were alcohol 
re lated . This figure was still well under half of the 1,096 
arrests made during the 1987 Isla Vista celebration. 

Police estimate that 15,000-20,000 people packed Isla 
Vista's streets Monday night at the height of the festivi-
ties, compared to the 35,000 last year who roamed the 
neighborhood on Saturday, Oct. 31. 

No major injuries were reported during the weekend. 
Although many Isla Vista Halloween partiers said 

their perception was that the Monday crowd was pre-
dominantly local, police reported that approximately 
70 percent of the people cited during the weekend were 
from out of town.

UCLA is in Quarantine Area 
for the Mediterranean Fruit Fly 

LOS ANGELES - Fruits picked from trees at 
UCLA may not leave campus, the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture warns. 

According to Inspector Morely Suzuki, UCLA is in 
the quarantine area of the Mediterranean fruit fly . 

Since it was learned two weeks ago that the Univer-
sity was in the quarantine area, fruit trees are being 
stripped before they become ripe enough to be picked. 

The fruit fly will multiply if removed from the qua-
rantine area, said Dr. Rosser Garrison, entomologist 
for L.A. County. "It feeds on 300 different kinds of 
fruits and vegetables and causes considerable damage 
to the crop industry." 

However, the plums, apricots and flowery peaches 
which are found "all over" the campus cause no harm if 
eaten. In addition, fruits which are not readily edible 
for human consumption may also play host to the fruit 
fly .

Committee for World Democracy 
Presents "Burroughs" 

The Committee for World Democracy will be pre-
senting two films this Friday evening. Both are free and 
will be shown in Third Lecture Hall 107 at 7 p.m. 

Burroughs. a film directed by Howard Brookner, is 
about the life of William S. Burroughs. Burroughs has 

been called the literary dean of the American avant-
garde, the father of Beat, the grandaddy of Punk and 
one of America's most dryly funny writers. Filmed over 
a period of four years with details of his scandalous 
life: the shooting of his wife in a drunken William Tell 
stunt, an affair with Allen GinSburg, heroin addiction 
and the literary acclaim that came late in life. 

Pul/ My Daisy. which presents a slice of life in a New 
York Bowery loft, will also be viewed Friday evening. 
It documents the subculture of the 1950's. Burroughs 
lasts 86 minutes and Pull My Daisy is 29 minutes long. 

Third Dorms Win Desiln A wards 
A new dormitory complex on the Third College 

campus at UCSD has won two awards for excellence in 
design. 

The facility, built into a hillside overlooking the 
ocean and Torrey Pines State Park, received a citation 
for design from the American Institute of Architects 
and a PANDA Award Honorable Mention for plan-
ning and design from the Planning Commission of the 
City of San Diego. 

The dormitory's architect was Delawie/ Bretton/ 
Wilkes Associates (DBW), the design firm responsible 
for the Penguin Encounter at Sea World, the new 
Police Headquarters in downtown San Diego and the 
Metropolitan Transit Development Board building 
now under construction. 

Running contrary to trend, the architects consulted 
with a student committee prior to drawing the plans. 
"They gave us excellent input, particularly concerning 
the use of space and the inclusion of common lounge 
areas," DBW senior partner Homer Delawie said. 

The 50 pods are stacked in eight striking gray 
modules of varying heights, enhanced with blue trim. 
A bridge flows from the enclave to the upper campus, 
where calssrooms are located. 

The architects' primary challenge was to create a 
somewhat dense, urban environment of UCSD's West-
ern slopes. "The terrain helped dictate the solution. We 
wanted something that would step down the hillside 
and that's why we settled on a cluster concept," Dela-
wie said. 

In contrast to the modular living quarters, the com-
plex also contains a rounded building at the top of the 
slope, housing the popular Oceanview Terrace dining 
hall, administrative offices and several conference 
rooms. The residential cubes cluster at the bottom of 
the hill around an informal, grass amphitheater, 
designed for concerts and other programs. Recreational 
facilities include a sand volleyball court and a regula-
tion size basketball court. 

On the design team with Delawie were DOW 
partners Mike Wilkes and Jim Barker. Mark Nelson of 
FD&C wa~ the UCSD project manager. 

The dormitory was built by the Dillingham Con-
struction Company, based in Pleasanton, CA. Lands-
cape architect was Wimmer/ Yamada and Associates.

RIGHTS 
Continued from pale 1 
first proposed, but, Finlan said, 
"The significant parts are sti ll in 
there." 

Wong, who co-authored the 
final version of the resolution, 
said that he had opposed the orig-
inal proposal. 

He expressed a sentiment pre-
viously mentioned by other coun-
cil members, saying, "I was not 
against the idea .. . I didn't think 
[the resolution) was specific 
enough." 

Both Finlan and Wong ex-
pressed great satisfaction with the 
final passing of the resolution. 

"Finally, we've taken care of 
it," Wong said, "and that feels 
good." 

Also on the topic of student 
rights, Che members informed 
the council of , heir current con-
flict with the police and the ad-
ministration, and said that the 
administration had repeatedly 
violated its own regulations in 
their alleged harassment of the 
Che. 

CLIMATE 
Continued from pace 1 
people worldwide that food pro-
duction and other activiti~s will 
be dramatically affected by po-
tential changes in the Earth's 
climate. 

According to the most exten-
sive climate models to date, the 
average annual temperatures will 
rise to a high not seen in more 
than 100,000 years. With respect 
to specific rates of change and the 
regional distributions of these 
changes, however, there are dis-
agreements. 

"What makes the problem so 
difficult to solve is that the emis-
sions of greenhouse gases [which 
cause these changes) comes from 
very vital societal activities," ex-
plained Michael MacCracken, 
leader of the Atmospheric and 
Geophysical Sciences Division at 
Lawrence Livermore National 
Laboratory 

"Carbon dioxide is a conse-
quence of transportation, heat-
ing, and industrial activity; 
methane is a consequence of rice 
production and natural gas pro-

duction; and chloroflourocarbons 
are essential for refrigeration, air 
conditioning, production of insu-
lation, and as solvents. While we 
can reduce and substitute for some 
uses, many people of the world 
want more of these uses - not 
less," MacCracken said. 

Along with pollution, the vary-
ing amount of radiation emitted 
by the sun, volcanic activity, and 
long-term natural climate varia-
bility all contribute to changes in 
the global climate. 

A focal point in this program is 
to integrate data from the many 
different lines of research and 
form a clear mathematical picture 
of the climate system. To handle 
the incredible volume of informa-
tion, the program will require 
state-of-the-art technology in super-
computing. 

Senior Vice President of the 
University of California William 
R. Frazer said that "the collabo-
ration by Scripps, Los Alamos 
and Lawrence Livermore effec-
tively demonstrates the intent and 
the advantages of the Institutional 
Collaborative Research Program. 
It allows the resources of the three 
institutions to work together for 
the benefit of all."

_____________________________ ~~oq~~~----------------------------

4 Thursday. November 10. 1988 

I t wa Friday night when we finally blew up the Jeep. The explosion shook the whole valley and sent chunks of red shrapnel flying over 
the house and all the way back to the White River ational Forest. 

All traffic stopped on the road and the elk herd scattered in panic. 
But not for long. IL was over in 22 seconds. Nobody was injured and 

no animals were killed, despite the ominous presence of Russell 
Chatham, the famous meat-eating artist from Montana. 

Russell i also a famous chef - and whenever he shows up, things 
die. He will jerk a tarpon out of the sea or an antelope off the prairie 
just to get his hands on the meat. 

It is like a cooking fetish, hooked up with a high sense of art and a 
wolf like hunger for anything that drips blood . ... And when he heard 
we were about to set oft a huge bomb in the midst 01 an elk herd, he 
flew over from San Francisco a day early. 

But there was no meat on that day. for Russell or anyone else. The 
only thing that died in the blast was the Jeep, which had fought 
valiantly for something like 55 hours against the crude and stupid 
death that we finally inflicted on it. 

The bomb was huge. by local standards. It was four sticks of Iramite, 
a brutal plastic explosive known as "Super Dynamite" in the trade, 
wedged under the hood of an old red Jeep Wagoneer, equipped with 3 
278 HP V-8 Chevy engine and four new studded whitewall Michelin 
XAS mud & snow tires ... and it was what they call in The Business "an 
extremely dangerous wrap." 

Which was true. The old steel Wagoneer, a relic from some earlier 
and better days when Jeeps were still built like small tanks, had 
withstood the assaults of some of the meanest and best-equipped boys 
in the international violence business. It had been packed full of 
dynamite, soaked down with gasoline and then blasted at point-blank 
range for two hours with flares, full-auto, and .50-calibertracer / rockets 
from a newfangled $2,500 single-shot sniper rifle that was brought over 
the mountains from Boulder by some wild boys from Soldier of 
Fortune magazine. 

B Ut nothing had worked . The 12-guage "high-impact~ shotgun flares , designed to 
explode in a blaze of phosphorus at precisely 150 yards, fluttered 

limply to earth in the tall grass of the pasture at less than half the 
distance, setting fire to old fence posts and hay bales .... The full-auto 
M-16s were utterly useless, spraying bullets all over the landscape and 
hitting everything except the Jeep, which had been set up only 100 
yards away. 

It was a series of horrible jokes. The big rifle - a custom-built item 
weighing 29 pounds and mounted with a scope so precise tliat it was 
"guaranteed" to hit a watermelon at 3,000 yards - turned out to be 
worse than a Roman candle in the hands of a drunken teenager. 

It was advertised as "state of the art~ in terms of accuracy, impact, 
nash suppression and no recoil, a totally modern weapon .... But the 
first person to fire it, local sportsman and ski merchant Dan Dibble, 
fell away from his shot with blood spurting out of his forehead from a 
terrible recoil-whack that split the flesh between his eyes like a blow 
from a nine-pound hatchet. 

He bled all over the house for two or three hours, and his shot was at 
least eight feet over the target - a huge ball of fire that landed 
somewhere up in the snow. . 

The Soldier of Fortune boys were embarrassed, but none of them 
could do any better. 

These were the big-time shooters and the cream of the hired 
mercenary crop, with access to any weapons they wanted - in Wood 
Creek or Nicaragua - and somehow they failed to hit the dynamite or 
anything else that would give us the massive explosion we were looking 
for. 

The only break in the long afternoon of truly crazy incompetence 
came when one of the meres managed to hit the front seat of the Jeep 
with a tracer-incendiary round, and set the upholstery on fire. 

W e were gripped by a feeling of ugliness when tbe target failed to explode. Nobody knew how to explain it. The Jeep was 
still smoldering, but the bomb refused to go off ... and it 

would stay that way for the next 50 hours, a living bomb that nobody 
could go near. 

The mercs pulled out quickly, taking their used brass with them. We 
chased them down the road as far as the tavern, where they tried to seek 
refuge and pass for normal tourists . 

The fat one locked himself in the men's room, but Tex kicked the 
door down and dragged him out by the hair. 

The one who called himself "chief" Oed out the back door and tried 
to hide in the bowels of the trailer court. Two others barricaded 
themselves in the Laundromat and threatened to commit suicide unless 
they could talk to Ed Bradley and make the whole story public. 

They were still there when the tavern closed at midnight, and the 
Jeep was still on fire in the back pasture. 

The dynamite was still simmering on top of the DieHard battery, 
and one oftheir women had run off with their Power Wagon , heading 
back to Boulder at top speed. 

When I went back home, around three, a surly crowd was still 
gathered in front of the Laundromat, jabbering distractedly and 
chanting Sandanista slogans. 

The nightmare went on for two more days and nights until finally on 
Friday afternoon, my neighbor George Stranahan, the famous beef 
rancher,came over with a fistful of blasting cap and blew the Jeep into 
thousands of small red chips. "Merry Christmas, ~ he said as he left.

UCSD Violates 
Its Own Policy 

Editor: 
In re ponse to the 'Clamp 

Down' article on the Che Cafe, 
(Guardian, ov.7) alluding to a 
new policy, we feel clarification is 
required. The incident is not 
isolated in the campus administra-
tion's working with the police in 
bypassing University policies. To 
close any student organization or 
invoke disciplinary sanctions, such 
as requiring paid police security, 
the University is required to 
provide a hearing. The University 
violated its own policies in closing 
the Che last spring and again is 
continuing its harassment by using 
the police. 

The concert scheduled for Nov. 
5 was not cancelled because the 
police required $250 (not $5(0) 
for their security. The concert 
was, in fact, cancelled after Linda 
Stack from U EO (University 
Events Office), in the presence of 
Assistant Vice Chancellor Tommy 
Tucker, said that the Che could 
be shut down permanently if 
"anything was to happen." 

Threatening to close the Che 
has been the stance of the Uni-
versity for years, and they have on 
occasion demanded its closure, as 
last spring quarter, without due 
process as required by Section 
33.11 of UCSD Policies and 
Procedures Applying to Student 
Acrivities. These threats force Che 
members to engage in hours of 
extra research and dealings with 
the administration to make them 
comply with their own published 
policies. The force and prejudice 
employed by the University offi-
cials is evident in Tommy Tucker's 
contemptuous statements, "The 
Guardian is a bunch of lies," and 
he added, "The Che Care is 
autonomous, about as autono-
mous as I am." 

The Che Cafe is a student run 
collective, built by students, and 
paid for by student support. The 

University's unending patroniza-
tion of the Che to conform to 
policies that don't exist is viewed 
by the collective as the most demand-
ing harassment - demanding in 
that it requires so much energy in 
fighting the University back to 
UCSD Policy, when that energy 
would be directed towards 
expanding the collective and rais-
ing money for the various chari-
ties that the Che Cafe gives 
thousands to each year. 

The University officials and 
police together must have realized, 
by reading the year end profit t loss 
statement we are required to turn 
in, that the average donation the 
Che made from each event was 
about $250 . The amount 
coincides with the $250 of security 
fees being demanded. This cost 
effectively eliminates the money 
raised and inhibits our ability to 
promote benefits. 

The police continue to assert 
that it was their decision to require 
security. University Center Board 
Director Jim Carruthers said, "I 
understand that it's a good police 
report ... it's the police who 
determine the problem ... if it's 
not in your area you shouldn't 
have to pay for it ." 

Lt. Dyer of the University 
police, when asked about the 
reason for the extra security fee, 
answered, " ... anytime any organi-
zation needs to pull a police 
officer to just stand there and not 
do anything else, it (the organi-
zation) has to be charged." This is 
in conflict with the University 
policy that security is to be paid 
for by the University unless alco-
hol is being served. 

He continued with a statement 
of his purpose, "We are the people 
who draw the line to where people

An Observer at the Chilean Election 
A Step Closer 
To Democracy 
By PAUL W. DRAKE 
Professor of Political Science 

For foreign observers, like 
myself, there were three mys-
teries to be explained about the 
Chilean plebiscite of October 5, 
1988. (I) Why did a dictator-
ship hold an honest election 
and accept defeat? (2) How did 
the opposition win a contest 
controlled by the government? 
(3) How can that oppostion 
victory be leveraged into a transi-
tion to democracy? 

Chile's dictator of fifteen 
years, Augusto Pinochet Ugarte, 
held a plebiscite in which all 
citizens over eighteen years of 
age could vote "yes" or "no" on 
his continuation in office for 
eight more years. He did so 
because the Constitution he 
imposed in 1980 called for that 
plebiscite. The armed forces had 
vowed that their government's 
authority and legitimacy rested 
on ab olute adherence to that 
charter. Therefore the ruling 
junta - the commanders-in-
chief of the Army, avy, Air 
Force, and National Police -

was determined to conduct a 
reasonably fair plebiscite. 

The junta insisted on ample 
registration, which reached 93 
percent of the eligible voters. It 
lifted the State of Siege, allowed 
virtually all exiles to return 
home, and granted fifteen min-
utes a day on television to the 
opposition. The military leaders 
also guaranteed that the 
voti!)g itself would be fraud-
proof, with oppostion and 
foreign observers at every trans-
parent ballot box. Although the 
regime still enjoyed enormous 
coercive, financial , and media 
advantages, it gave the oppo i-
tion a fighting chance. 

Why did a military govern-
ment notorious for its wide-
spread violations of human 
rights and democratic norms 
preside over a plebiscite that it 
couldn't steal? The main reason 
was that the regime wanted to 
use the voting to legitimize the 
system enshrined in its 1980 
Constitution, regardless of the 
outcome. The armed forces felt 
their honor was at stake, forcing 
them to abide by their own 
laws. They had to extend mini-
mal guarantees of fairness to get 
the opposition to participate. 
Moreover, hundreds of foreign 
observers were watching the 
process. 

International pressure for a 
clean election also came from 
the U.S. government. Finally, 
the junta did not want any 
irregularities to tarnish the 
expected victory of the Yes. 

Why was the Pinochet camp 
so cocksure of victory? They 
believed that voters would be 
afraid of a return to the conflicts 
under socia list President 
Salvador Allende (1970-73). The 
country was in the third year of 
growth rates over five percent. 
Inflation wa down to 12 per-
cent, while investments, exports, 
employment. and real wages

Plebiscite

were rising. Pinochet had all the 
campaign resources oft he govern-
ment, the armed forces, and 90 
percent of the media at his dispo-

I sal. He enjoyed the solid support 
! of the business elites and believed 
I that women and country dwellers 
I would provide the margin of 
. victory. 

He counted on the opposition 
being divided and ineffectual. In 
the final analysis, the regime suf-
fered from self-deception. Like 
many other authoritarian rulers, 
Pinochet was told and heard only 
what he wanted to hear. 

How did the opposition manage 
to prevail? The structure of the 
Plebiscite allowed a socially and 
ideologically diverse coalition -
stretching from the moderate 
Right to the far Left - to dohere 
around the only point they agreed 
on: No to Pinochet and his regime. 
They converted that unity into 
victory by overcoming three fears 
among the popUlation: fear of 
Pinochet, fear of a return to the 
Allende period, and fear of the 
unknown. They dispelled terror 
with door-to-door campaigning, 
with huge rallies, and with the 15-
minute TV spots. While the Yes 
ads stressed the threat of violence 
and chaos, the No commercials 
focused on a future of "happiness, " 
free from torture, censorship, and 
tyranny. Aboveall, the opposition 
mdae the plebiscite a referendum 
on political freedom, not on 
economic prosperity. . 

America. democratic forces cele-
brated that repudiallon of military 
rule. The task ahead in Chile. 
however. was to translate the No 
into a transition to full democracy. 
Pinochet continues to govern for 
another year, while competitive 
elections for president and con-
gre s were scheduled for Dec-
ember, 1989. 

For Pinochet, the goal was to 
narrow the definition of the No as 
only limitation on his term as 
president. He intended to stay on 
as commander-in-chief of the 
armed forces for at least four 
more years. Above all, he planned 
to defend the 1980 Constitution's 
system of "protected democracy" 
under the tutelage of the armed 
forces . The key provisions made 
the constitution itself virtually 
unchangeable, one-fourth of the 
senate unelected , Marxist groups 
excluded from participation, and 
presidential decisions subject to 
review by the military. 

For the opposition, the post-
plebiscite strategy was to broaden 
the No to signify bargaining with 
the armed forces to reform the 
authoritarian constitution. They 
also sought to maintain their unity 
behind a single moderate candi-
date for the 1989 elections. Win-
ning a large mandate in those 
contests might allow them to press 
for further democratization. Mean-
while, they tried to restrain their 
more jubilant and militant fol-
lowers, who wanted more im-
mediate results from the No. As 
the opposition navigates that 
perilous passage from rejection of 
authoritarianism to reconstruc-
tion of democracy, they will be 
looking to the international com-
munity for continued support.

Wiesenthal Ignores New Genocide 
UItor: 

I personaUydidn' go to see Simon Wiesentbal's 
speech in the Gym entitled "The Murderers 
Amona Us. "I would never pay money to ao and 
listen to a hypocrite. If I would have aone, I 
would have liked to ask him one simple question, 
"Who will brina the Israeli war criminals to 
justice after they have annihilated the Palestinian 
people?" 

I'm talkinaabout warcnminals like Menachem 
Beain aDd Ariel Sharon who were responsible for 
the deaths of 40,000 eivilians in the 1982 invuion 
of Lebanon alone. Over J.S million people 
needed relief a .. iltanee sueh as food, shelter, and 
medical supplies and over 800,000 people were 
made homeless. 

Ariel Sharon was also responsible for the 
..... 1ICTe of a whole villaF in the I~'s. His 
troop 101 totally destroyed the viUaF of Kibye 
aDd killed all of its inhabitants. Menachem 
Belin's less well-known exploit was the villqe of 
Deir Yasin where approximately SOC> people were 
murdered in cold blood. 

In a feature article (Guardian, Nov. 3) it said 
that Wiesenthal had "extreme courage to face 

those who have performed unspeakable evil." I 
say that Wiesenthal has alot of gall. not couraae, 
for him to [ask us to support Israel] while they 
now are the ones performin, unspeakable evils in 
the West Bank and Gala Strip. Simon Wiesen-
thaI's work is useless and contrary to the praent 
historical events. 

In this same article, Wiesenthal was .. ked if 
there "could be another holocaust?" "Of course" 
was the answer, "When it can happen in a 
culturally rich and intelligent nation like Ger-
many, it can happen anywhere in the world. I will 
not excl\&de any country." Why then does he 
exclude Israel, witb their Nazi-like tacties in the 
West Bank and Oaza Strip? â¢ 

If we close OUI eyes Ionl enoup to the present, 
and drown ourselves in a sea of sympathy for 
what happened in the past, when we wake up, we 
miJht find out that it has been paid for by 
genocide of the Palestinian people. In your 
article, Wiesenthal fean discoverina that "i,nor-
ante has onte again allowed another genocide to 
be carried to its final conclusion." After the 
genocide of the Palestinian people tell me what 
lessons we learned from Simon Wiesenthal. .

We asked him about the neces-
sity of two police officers and he 
responded, "When two police 
officers handle things they're much 
more aggressive in the way they 
hand le things." 

These statements seem uncon-
stitutional in nature and presume 
violence, which has never hap-
pened at the Che, and the col-
lective has never had to be "aggres-
sive" in its dealings with patrons.

We acquired, from Ernie Mort 
at the Revelle ~rovost office, the 
campus police Criminal Offense 
Reports for the past two years. 
According to these reports, in the 
month of October this year: there 
was over $80,000 in theft on the 
campus; as well as knives confi-
scated at both Third and Revelle; 
an arrest of a man with a gun at 
the Pub; marijuana found at the 
Coast Apartments; arson at Muir 
College, and other incidents. The 
police chose to focus on one bong 
found at the Che on Oct. 7, dedi-
cating rhree police officers to the 
Che area for Jhe f('\lowing events 

and requiring the Che to pay lor 
Officer Tracy's overtime. The 
Criminal Offense Report lists less 
than six incidents of any kind in 
the past two years, during which 
time more than 200 bands have 
played at the Che. 

As to the assertion by the police 
that they had received calls from 
parents, LI. Dyer added, "Your 
position is they [the patrons] 
should be left alone until they are 
creating a problem. Our position 
we want to get it off before there is 
one.'Cause we don't want to just 
react to it there." He connected

EVERYONE TALKS 
ABOUT CHANGING THE WORLD. 

THIS YEAR 
3150 PEOPLE WILL 
ACTUALLY DO IT. 

Not everyone is cut out to change the world . After all, it takes education, skills 
and a spare two years. 

Also a willingness to work. Hard . 
This year 3,750 Americans will join the Peace Corps to do just that. They'll do 

things like build roads, plant forests and crops, teach English, develop small businesses, 
train community health workers, or even coach basketball. However; what they'll be 
dOing isn't half as important as the fact that they'll be changing a little piece of the 
world . . . for the better. 

And when they return, these 3,750 Americans will find that experience doing 
hard work will have another benefit . Irs exactly what their next employers are 
looking for. 

So, give the Peace Corps your next two years. And while you're out changing 
the world, you'll also be making a place in it for yourself.

Lifestyles With Krishna Consciousness 
By JULIE SO TAG 
eOlllriblll ing H'rll er 

You may have een them 
parad ing along the sidewalks in 
d owntown La Jolla and Pacific 
Beach or playing odd illstruments 
by the gym tep and chanting 
" Hare Krishna ." Shaved heads. 
peach togas and vegetarian food 
are their trademarks. but few 
outsiders know who the Hare 
Krishna really are and why they 
a re on campus. 

Most people know of this reli-
gious group because their recruit-
ing tactics are so often questioned. 
I n fact. t hey are presently involved 
in a law uit concern ing these 
techniques. 

Robin George acc used the 
Krish na society of brai nwashing 
her In o rd er to get her to join their 
relig ion and li\ e in the temple. 
She won and the case is now in 
appea ls. The Hare Krishnas 
belie v e the chargers are 
unfounded , citing a maxim of 
common law that "he who con-
sents to an act is not wronged by 
it. " 

In any ase. the Hare Kri hnas 
are a very visible group in an 
Diego and at CSD. 

The Hare Krishna are member 
of the I nternational Society for 
K n h na Consciou nes (IS K-
CON) . Members of lSKCON 
come from all age and ethnic 
groups because there are lS K-
CON temples, restaurants and 
farms all over the world . 

In 1965 Bhaktivedanta Swami 
Prabhupada brought this reli-
gion, which is a recognized 
branch of Hinduism, to the 
United States from India. He 
died in 1977. after he had trans-
lated man boo ks from the 
a ncient Sanskrit text . which 
Krishna use as the guides for 
their religion . 

It was becau e of one of the e 
books that Valmiki Dasa became 
a Hare Krishna in 1982. At this 
time he wa a mu ician who 
believed in "creative agnosti-
cism." 

He was given a Krishna text in 
an airport. He read it and liked 
what it said. Soon after, he went 
to a Kri shna temple to see what it 
was about. 

Valmiki i now a devotee . He 
lives in a temple, wears a tradi-
tional saffron-colored robe and 
have his head . 

He explained that the saffron 
color signifies celibacy while 
white usually means marriage. 

Head shaving serves two pur-
poses. It is done for tradition as 
well as cleanliness. Women, how-
ever. don't shave their heads. 
Instead , they cover their hair. 

ot all member of lSKCON 
live in a temple and dress as he 
does . Valmiki compared himself 
to a priest a nd called other temple 
member the co ngregation. 

These members live normal 
lives, wear normal clothes and 
have normal jobs. They attend 
temple ervice during the week 
and on Sundays, ob erve the 
days of fasting, maintain a vege-
tariandietand follow the normal 
Krishna cu tom of rising at4 a. m. 
in order to chant. 

Man y of these people are 
UCS D students . 

There is a Hare Krishna club 
on campus called the Vedic 
Society. The president graduated 
last year and , as a result, Krishnas 

have not been as active on campus 
thi year. However, they plan to 
organize things soon and begin 
having their weekly meetings and 
vegetarian feasts once again. 

Hare Krishna customs are both 
traditional and modern . 

The facial paint, for example, 
is purely traditional and any Hare 
Krishna can wear it. Many also 
wear beads around their necks 
which they believe help them go 
to heaven. 

Program Stresses Safety They cite many reasons for being vegetarians. It is for modern reasons of health in the case of 
red meat. They also do not eat 
poultry or fish because they 
believe in reincarnation .

Guardian Intern 

UCSD and its surrounding 
community are growing at a 
rapid rate; the construction of 
numerous buildings and the 
addition of several parking lots 
arc signs of an increasing 
population. Though all this 
growth will undoubtedly enrich 
campus life, one aspect directly 
endangered by the expansion 
is student safety. 

~Though the crime statistics 
at UCSo..how that the campus 
is overall a safe environment, it 
is imponant to realize that 
UCSD is not a peaceful little 

haven," said Nancy Wahlig, 
director of Student Safety 
Awareness Services. As a result, 
UCSD has taken various meas-
ures in an effort to improve 
student safety. . 

This year, Student Safety 
Awareness Services hal split 
offfrom legal services to form 
its own resource center. 

.. As the issues concerning 
student safety grew more com-
plicated, more attention was 
reuqired to focus on the issues. 
The only way to ensure this 
was to establish a iCparate 
office," Wahlig said. 

Problems and complaints 
concerning student safety are 
also voiced at the AU-Campua

Commuter Board. The com-
mittee has worked on proposals 
to improve lighting at several 
locations on campus and to 
circulate information conc:ern-
ina the call boxes. 

One of the more immediate 
coucems focuses OIl the abICGQC 
of liJhting in the overflow 
parking lots. OritinaUy tbae 
lots were designed for overflow 
traffic during the day; however, 
more and more commutCII are 
finding that tbey arc retumiq 
to their can when it is dark. AI 
a result of many complaints, 
there are plans to iastallliJht-
ina systems in tbele lots.

Every living creature is a 
spiritual being with a soul, ac-
cording to Krishna beliefs, so if 
you kill innocent animals you get 
bad karma. I n addition, they cite 
examples of environmental prob-
lems and food shortages which 
can be attributed to the use of 
animals for food. 

Waste from cows can reach 
toxic levels and has caused acid 
rain in some countries. Grain is 
wasted on animals, rather than 
being used to feed starving people 
because it takes 16 pounds of 
grain to produce only one pound 
of meat , Hare Krishna literature 
explains.

few basic rules, according to 
Duradharsa, a devotee at the 
Pacific Beach temple. Theydon't 
believe in gambling, intoxication 
(including caffeine and nicotine) , 
eating meat or an illicit sex life. 

They believe when they give 
up these contaminaflts of the 
material world and take up 
chanting, dancing and feasting, 
they can reach a blissful state of 
self-realization. This is called 
Krishna consciousness. 

Valmiki compared Krishna 
consciousness with Western reli-
gions by describing the latter as 
spiritually naive. He explained 
that, although the Krishna believe 
in the teachings of Jesus and 
accept him as the son of God, 
this is just a small part of the 
Krishna religion. 

He further explained that 
Krishna beliefs predate Christian-
ity by 3,000 years and, therefore, 
incorporate many more ideas. In 
comparison with the Bible, they 
have a 30 volume collection of 
books depicting the history of 
God. 

Like most religions, ISKCON 
questions modern science. How-
ever, instead of citing Biblical 
examples or referring to ancient 
texts to disprove it , they have 
their own science division headed 
by Dr. Richard Thomas, who 
earned his Ph . D. at Cornell 
University. 

Valmiki thinks that knowledge 
about modern science is im-
portant because he says that 
science is a tool which can be 
very dangerou if mi used . 

Hare Krishnas examine scien-
tific information they feel i 
misused in order to draw their 
own conclusions. They question 
such things a evolution and the 
big bang theory and publish their 
new findings in a maga7inecalled:

is the absence of lights at the con-
truction sites around campus. The 
task force has suggested that the 
University include a clau e in any 
contract drawn up with a design 
and construction firm stipulating 
t hat the contractors provide tem-
porary lighting at the construc-
tion sites until the development 
has been completed. So far, this 
proposal has not yet been adopted , 
but the Commuter Board con-
tinues to push for its resolution . 

Lighting surveys and "walk 
arounds" are often completed in 
an attempt to improve student 
afety. In 1987, a lighting survey 

was conducted by a special task 
force comprised of representatives 
from Associated Students, Stu-
dent Safety Awareness, Rape 
Prevention, and Des:gn and Con-
truction. The force spent three 

months testing the lighting all 
over campu with a light meter. 

"The standard of lighting was 
better than expected," said Crime 

Molly Atexand.r I Guardian 
Nancy Wahlig encourages re -
porting suspicious things. 

Eighty-one cars have been tolen 
this year as of September, com-
pared with 41 cars last year atthat 
time. 

A survey completed as of 
October which began ill January 
of 1988 showed no I apes on 
campus. "These statistics are based 
on what is reported to the Police 
Department," Jenkins said . 

A growing probleM on college 
ca mpuses today is date rape and 
acq uaintance rape Since many 
people can't define sexual harass-
ment they often fail to report an 
incident or get counseling. 

"The consequences of sexual 
harassment are often time very

serious. Anybody that has been 
raped or sex ually a aulted may 
be ending out mixed messages, 
and, for this reason alone, it is real 
important to get counseling. If 
you don't want to report the 
incident to the police or to other 
source, by all means get help," 
Wahlig said . 

Many women who have been 
raped fail to report the occurrence 
because they feel they are to blame 
or they feel they might get their

Hare Krishnas obtain funds for 
this, Valmiki responded that ll1e 
temple takes care of it. Hei mplied 
that the Krishnas use a process 
of donations, as is common in 
most religions. 

Despite some similarities with 
western religions, the K rishr.a 
Society suggests a non-religious 
view for understanding Krishna 
religion. They stress that Krishna 
co nscio usness is a science that 
requires intelligence to under-
stand.

women don't say anything because 
they are afraid that other people 
will blame them for the rape and 
some do not want to face the 
stigma that is often attached to 
women who have been raped , 
explained Wahlig. 

If a person is raped or sexually 
assaulted, it is important that the 
victim know what to do and what 
options are available. The victim 
can talk with omeone at the 
Police Department, at Psycho-
logical Services, at Student Safety 
Awareness Services or even a 
friend. There is also a rape cri is 
center which runs a 24-hour 
hotline, 233-3088. No matter who 
they contact, it is important that 
rape victims tell someone, Wah lig 
emphasized.

Lisa Cauble, a volunteer student 
staff member at the Women's 
Resource Center who came to 
UCSD in 1986, said, "The light-
ing system was horrendous. Sev-
eral people at the Women's Cen-
ter- complained about the inade-
quate lighting and have since 
witnessed improvements." 

"Although there are walk 
arounds a nd lighting surveys, 
many students feel the campus 
needs better lighting," said Dave 
Sheldon, a member of the Muir 
Commuter Council. Even though 
the University spends thousands 
of dollars a year on improved 
lighting, there are constraints 
which require Physical Plant 
Services to prioritize projects. As 
a result, certain areas of campus 
don't get the attention they de-
serve. 

Since the campus is not entirely 
safe nor crime-free, students are 
advised to learn to take an active 
role in protecting themselves. 

"Students are encouraged to 
avoid short cuts that are in dark, 
secluded areas. It is real important 
for people to always be fine-tuned 
to their environment and not grow 
lacksadaisical in taking care of 
themselves. I t is also important to 
report things that seem suspicious. 
Reporting crimes is an excellent 
method of prevention," Wahlig 
said. 

Although the University pro-
vides for student safety, it cannot 
ultimately be responsible for pro-
tecting its population. 

Prevention is the best form of 
protection . "It is crucial that 
everybody realizes that the call 
boxes on campus are available for 
help." Jenkins said. 

"Your situation does not have 
to be an emergency to use the call 
boxes . They are provided as a 
service to any person who feels 
help is needed." Jenkins added . 

One thing that people often fail 
to realize is that the call boxes can 
be used to call a Community 
Service Officer. The Crime Pre-
vention Center is working on 
distributing information that will 
alert people to the function of the 
call boxes. 

So, just how safe is UCSD? 
Statistics show that violent crime 
is relatively. low, but even so. the 
potential for cri me increases every 
year with the rapid growth of 
UC D. 

Currently, property crime, 
including auto theft, seem to be 
the biggest problem at UCSO.

Women's Volleyball 
Hosts West Regional 

Men's Soccer Faces Emory University 

Quarterfinals Here Sunday 
By JORDAN O. KAR UBIAN 
Contributiltt Writ~, 

We have a sports dynasty in the matilll here at UCSD. You 
say you're not aware of it? Well, the women's volleyball team is 
once apin vyin, for the Division III National Championship, an 
event that in recent yean has become as much a part of fall as the 
turning of leaves. 

If successful in their quest for a third straiibt national title, the 
Tritons will become the first volleyball team at IIny level to win 
five crowns. The path to victory for UCSD begins right here in 
the Triton Pavilion Fridav. when the top-seeded Tritons face the 
Winner of Thursday night's matchup between Pomona-Pitzer 
and M.l.T. on Friday at 7:30 p.m. p .m. 

UCSD is the top seed in the six-team tournament, but the 
competition is guaranteed to be fierce. 

"Every team comes in zero and zero; anybody can win," Head 
Coach Doug Dannevik said .. 

La Verne, the team which broke the Tritons' 43-game win 
streak over Division III teams in October; Pomona-Pitzer, a 
well-coached squad featuring impressive individual talent; and 
Colorado College, which boasts Kathy Costello who is possibly 
the top offensive player in the tournament, all have legitimate 
shots at taking the West. 

The outcome ofthis tournament is up in the air, but Dannevik 
and his squad are feeling confident. This year's team i. youn" 
but it has overcome the absence of any returnilll All-Americans 
with hard work, which has led to excellence in defense, blocld .... 
and passing. 

Dannevik, consequently. is proud of his team which he 
dubbed '"the most fun and responsive ever," and expectations fOI 
this weekend and perhaps beyond are runnina hi&h. 

The squad has been "runnina the offense better than it has all 
year long," Dannevik pointed out, regardil18 his team's recent 
performance. "Defense has been steady and blocking has been 
fantastic." Dannevik went so far as to call this year '"the most 
rewarding year ever coaching. " 

The Tritons have struggled somewhat to become the top seed 
in the West Regionals, but the biggest challenges still lie ahead. 
This weekend promises to offer some of the best volleyball seen 
here in a long time. UCSD, according to Dannevik. is '"the best 
volleyball school. Over UCLA. Over SDSU. Over anybody." 

On Thurday, Nov. 10, Pomona-Pitzer (17-7) will meet M.I. T. 
(32-6) in a 5 p.m. match, which will be followed by a 7:30 p.m.

By PHIL GR UEN 
Sports Editor 

An undefeated record can do 
many things for a team. For one, 
it can scare the living daylights 
out of an opponent. and for 
another, it can reward a team 
with certain advantages when 
post-sea on time comes around 
- such as the home field ad-
vantage . 

Whether or not the Emory 
University men's soccer team 
appears frightened by UCSD's 
20-0-2 record is impossible to tell 
at this particular juncture, but 
UCSD certainly has the home 
field adva ntage Sunday afternoon 
when the Tritons host Emory in 
a I p.m. NCAA Quarterfinal 
matchup. The winner of the game 
will advance to the NCAA Div-
ision III National Champion-
ships, to be held Nov. 19-20 on 
the campus of one of the four 
participating teams. 

The Tritons, fresh off two solid 
victories in Regional action last 
weekend over both Macalester 
College and' Cal State Stanis-
laus, will now tangle with the 14-
4-3 Eagles from the academically-
oriented liberal arts school of 
Atlanta. Emory earned the right 
to face UCSD when it upset both 
nationally sixth-ranked Bethany 
College of West Virginia and 

orth Carolina Wesleyan in the 
South Regional Tournament last 
weekend . The Eagles were ranked 
fourth among the four teams 
that were competing in their 
Regional , and they head into 
Sunday's contest undou btedly as

saCU'lblanl Guardian 
Mike Bradley (2). here in action against Occidental Saturday, has 
been an integral part of the Triton defense which has recorded 16 
shutouts this season, 

heavy underdogs. This. however, 
does not seem to have any effect 

, on Triton Head Coach Derek 
Armstrong. 

"We're . not doing anything 
differently to prepare for this game 
than we have for any other game," 
Armstrong pointed out. "We're 
ju t going to keep doing what 
we've been doing." 

Evidently, whatever he has 

been doing has worked . This 
year's Tritons have recorded an 
astounding J 6 shutouts, and their 
20 wins are one victory shy ofthe 
school record of 21 , set three 
years back in 1985, when the 
Tritons reached the Quarterfinals 
but fell to Washington University 
of St. Louis.

Women's Soccer Heading 
to Nationals in the East 

By MOLLY McKAY 
Siaff Writer 

The undefeated women's soccer 
team may be feeling the heat as it 
attempts to capture its first ever 
National Championship this week-
end - but the heat will certainly 
not come from the weather. Even 
though the Tritons managed to 
brave the freezing temperatures in 
the Regionals last weekend in 
Minnesota, they get no break as 
far as the weather is concerned 
when they head to perhaps colder 
temperatures in New York for the 

ational Tournament beginning 
Saturday. 

The battle for the NCAA Div-
ision III National Championships 
begins with UCSD playing Ithaca 
College of New York, and Wil-
liam Smith quaring off against 

Methodist of North Carolina. The 
tournament will be held at Wil-
liam Smith College in Geneva, 
New York this Saturday and 
Sunday, Nov. 12- 13. 

In last weekend's West Regional 
Tournament hosted by the Col-
lege of St. Thomas in St. Paul, 
Minnesota, the Tritons melted 
the icy atmosphere, four inches of 
snow, and 30 degree temperatures 
with sunny San Diego warmth 
and consequently combined 
back-to-back shutouts over SI. 
Thomas and Cortland State to 
advance to the Nationals. 

Shutouts are nothing new to 
this team. The Regional wins 
merely added two notches, the 
16th and 17th, in the team's shin 
guards. UCSD has now outscored 
its oppone nts 74-6 during the 
1988 campaign .

This year's Tritons are not quite 
as talented overall as last year's 
31-4 squad, but nevertheless have 
performed excellently in what was 
considered to be somewhat of a 
rebuilding year. 

The snow (background) led to extremely muddy conditions on lhe 
field as the Tritons (dark uniforms) captured the West Regional in 
Minnesota last weekend . UCSD is currently 19-0-2, and including 
last weekend 's 3-0 and 2-0 victories over Sl. Thomas College and 
Cortland State. respectively, the Tritons have compiled an astounding 
1 7 shutouts this year. 

Ithaca advanced to the national 
semifinals by winning its first 
round game by a J..Q score over 
Brandeis, as well as upsetting top-
seeded and nationally ranked 
Plymouth State, 2..Q. William 
Smith, ranked number one for 
most of the 1988 season, cruised 
past Alfred College 6-0 in the first 
round, and downed Hartwick 2-1 
in the Regional Finals. Methodist 
defeated North Carolina Wesleyan 
3-1 before knocking off Kalama-

The UCSD men's sailing team 
captured second place at last 
weekend's Pacific Coas~ Sloop 
Championships, barely losing to 
overall winner Stanford. The team 
sailed a Moore 24' class sloop at 
the event. which was held in Santa 
Cruz. UCSD's crew consisted of 
Ron Rosenberg (skipper), Chris 
Redman, Wayne Zittel , and John 
Sterman.

Gronk and Slocum: 
On and Off the Wall 

Cam Slocum's "Still." a series of paintings created by utilizing a late 19th century 
photographic process, and Glugio Gronk Nicnndro's "A Wall Piece." which will be painted 
directly onto the walls of the gallery. will be featured on campus from November 12 to 
December 11 at the Mandeville Art Gallery. The dual displays will open with a reception for 
the artists at Mandeville trom 6 p .m . to 8 p.rn. on Friday, Nov. 11. 

A Los Angeles native. Slocum is a 1980 graduate of UCSD. Some of his early work was 
shown at the Attack Gallery and LACE (Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions) in Los 
Angeles. and at the Civilian ~ar1are Gallery and the Umbo Lounge in New York City. 

The "St111" series. currently being displayed at the Pence Gallery in Santa Manica until 
November 26. is a group of large-scale paintings. each roughly 72 x 72 inches, based on 
photo-Journalistic sources. In this series, Slocum uses a process in which negatiVes are slowly 
developed by sunlight. then chemically transferred to canvas. 

The majority of the series portrays images of decay based on socio-political images that 
beyond their historical context. When viewing his work. prepare to see the darker. 
aspect of human nature in the form of funerals. lynchings. institutional confinement. 
scenes and ironically. children playing. 

lighter side. the paintings are accompanied by photographs of Bristlecone pine 
trees. which are thought to be among the oldes1living objects on earth. The shots. otten taken 
at an upward angle. portray the true grandeur of the trees. giving ott the sense that they are 
ancient totem poles touching the sky. 

Nicandro, otherwise known as Gronlc. has been highly acclaimed as both a performance 
artist and a painter. He is scheduled to paint a large-scale. and as yet unknown. work on the 
gallery walls a few days prior to the exhibition's opening. 

In 1975. Gronk initially entered the art world by showing his work at the Long Beach 
Museum and the Los Angeles County Museum. In the past thirteen years. he has gained 
critical acclaim tor both his solo exhibitions and his tilm work with directors Hany Gamboa 
and Agnes Varda. 

Gronlc's recent work is part of a group show. "Hispanic Art in the United States." Originating 
at the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston. Texas. the show is currently travelling to New York. Los 
Angeles. Washington D.C .. New Mexico. Flortda. and Mexico City. 

The Mandeville Gallery is open from noon to 5 p .m .. Tuesday through Sunday. The two-man 
show has no admission fee and parking is free on weekends .

tThey Live,' 0 do they? 
by phil macgovern 

hiatus writer 

I went to see this movie with 
mix ed a nti cipa ti o n. John 

arpenter has lo ng been one of 
my favorite horror movie dir-
ectors, directing such classics as 
Halloween, and the movie that 
scared me the most, The Thin!!. 

So I hoped that this would be 
another thriller in the same vein. 
But tht'n I looked at the prt'ss kit 
and saw this movie starred Roddy 
Piper of Rowdy Roddy Piper of 
the World Wrestling Foundation 
fame. I thought to myself, "Can I 
take this movie seriously!" 

Besides, any movie with the 
rather lame and pretentious title 
of They Live deserves not to be 
taken seriously. Now that 1 have 
seen the movie I still don't know if 
'1 can take the movie seriously or 
with a grain of salt. 

Sometimes directors and screen 
writers make the mistake of not 
distinguishing their films with a 
particular genre. This can work 
to their advantage especially if 
their film breaks new ground 
somehow, but if you are on the 
edge between two particularly 
divergent areas, such as comedy 
and horror, you can have prob-
lems. Some movies do it success-
fully, but they are usually more 
camp than horror. 

I haven 't figured out what They 
Live is supposed to be. With lines 
like "I've come to chew gum and 
kick ass. And I'm all out of gum." 
and "Life's a birch. And she's in 
heat." I couldn't help laughing, 
and neither could the audience. 
They seemed really funny, bur are 
they supposed to be? Piper utters 
other gems like these with a straight 
face and in serious situations, so is 
that humor, or is he serious? 

The basic premise of They Litle 
is really very intQresting. It has a 
lot of potential and I sort of wish it 
was only a first draft and they 
were going to try again. It takes 
place on the streets of L.A., in the 
near future. The number of home-
less is growing at a record rate. 
Piper plays John Nada, a con-

Of course, Nada must save the 
world . He joins a small rebel 
group trying to defeat the ali .. ns 
and to reveal their disguise to the 
people. The aliens have taken over 
all the positions of authority (even 
Siskel and Ebert are aliens) and 
they control all the wealth. The 
wealthy humans are helping them; 
their greed outpacing their love of 
other humans. 

Nada and a fellow onstruction 
worker (played by Keith David 
who actually is quite good) pene-
trate the aliens' underground tun-
nels and go on to destroy. 

Good thing these aliens are 
taking over. They couldn't hit the 
broad side of a barn with a machine 
gun, so our two human heroes 
walk through the fortress 
unscathed. 

1 really can't find the faults in 
this movie. There are some minor 
things that I can gripe about: the 
horribly annoying score (by 

Ca rpenter himself), the very long 
and protracted fight scene (most 
humans would lx, unconscious 
after having their head whacked 

a~ainst pavement three or four 
times) and the strange nondelinia-
tion of the movie's genre. 

But I can't say that I like it 
t'ither. Piper is an average actor, 
his muscltÂ·s art.' enough to carry 
him through. John Nada has no 
character. My companion and I 
tried to name all the facts about 
his past that we knew and could 
come up with only two or three. 
This didn't help in interpreting his 
startling wit (or stupidity, depend-
ing o n your outlook). 

Some people are going to like it, 
some aren't. This is o ne movie 
that will be very good on video-
tape, so my advice is to wait until 
it comes out in the stores, and 
then make your choice. Movies 
arc too expensive to take this sort 
of risk. 

Roddy Piper and Keith David fight againsc alien forces in 'They Live." 
struction worker (a good job to ,-_________________________ --' 
show a lot of his over-developed 
wrestling muscles) who is down 
on his luck. He settles in a shanty 
town community near a church 
where some strange goings on are 
taking place. 

The police come and bust up 
the church, but in searching the 
rubble, Nada finds a box of sun-
glasses. He puts a pair on and sees 
that they reveal the real world -
under all signs and in magazines 
are subliminal messages to "Con-
form," "Buy," "Obey Authority," 
and "Marry and Reproduce." 

Even more startling is the dis-
covery that a large portion of the 
people around aren't human, but 
skeleton-like aliens bent on taking 
over the world .
