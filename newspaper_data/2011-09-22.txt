Tuition Increases by 10 Percent, May Rise Again Next Year

By Rebecca Horwitz
Associate News Editor The University of California Board of Regents 
has raised in-state tuition by 9.6 percent and 
an additional increase of 16 percent by the 
2015-16 school year is now being discussed. 
University of California tuition could increase 

by as much as 16 percent by the next academic 
year. The UC Board of Regents met Sept. 
15 at UC San Francisco to discuss methods 
of compensating for a projected system-
wide budget deficit of $2.5 billion by 2015. 
Depending on the amount of state funding, 
students could be paying anywhere from an 
eight to 16 percent fee increase yearly. 
  According to Executive Vice President of 
Business Operations Nathan Brostrom and 
Vice President of Budget and Capital Resources 
Patrick Lenz, there are three proposed methods 
for raising revenue. The Regents favors a 50-50 

split in which students would pay an eight 
percent fee increase, with the state funding 
the remaining eight percent. A second option 
has students paying 12 percent of the increase 
while the state pays four percent. The final 
scenario would require tuition to increase by 
16 percent each year until 2016.
     “This scenario that we’re looking at 
is not what we want,” Sherry Lansing, UC 
Board of Regents Chairman, said in Bloomberg 
Businessweek. “There’s not a person around 
this table that wants to increase tuition. We’ve 
done enough.”

 Under the last scenario, undergraduate 
tuition for California residents would rise to 
$22,068 from the current $12,192 by the 2015-
16 academic year, if state funding for the UC 
system does not increase, according to the UC 
Board of Regents. 
  UC Office of the President Spokesperson 
Ricardo Vasquez said that the Regents has not 
made any concrete decisions.
   “It’s not even a proposal yet,” Vasquez said. 
“It’s just a discussion. The idea was to create 

University of California tuition 
may increase by as much as 16 
percent by 2016. 

Student Dies 
Due to Heart 
Complications

By Margaret Yau
Managing Editor

Cristina Torres, a 
Warren College senior, 
died Sunday, Aug. 21 
due to medical com-
plications relating to a 
pre-existing heart con-
dition. She was 23.   

“[Cristina] was a 
very lively person — she 
would brighten up the 
room,” Torres’ sorority 
sister Kim Garcia said. 

 Literature profes-
sor Jorge Mariscal 
is hoping to create a 
scholarship in Torres’ 
name, to be given each 
year to a promising Latina 
undergraduate student. The scholarship is being 
planned. 

“[Cristina] was always inquisitive and eager 
to learn. I know that, given more time, she would 
have become a fierce defender of the Latino 
community,” Mariscal said in an email.  

 Torres was pursuing a double major in 
Spanish literature and political science, with 
plans of attending law school. 

She was also the social chair and an active 
member of the Sigma Pi Alpha sorority. 

“She was the center of attention, the life of 
the party,” Marisabel Salinas, Torres’ sorority 
sister, said.

 Salinas and a few of her fellow sisters plan 
on getting Torres’s college degree awarded to her 
posthumously.   

Torres’s family held a memorial service for 
her in Sun Valley on Aug. 25. Her family and 
sorority members also hope to have a memorial 
service on campus, but a date has not yet been 
determined.  

Torres is survived by her sisters Karina and 
Fabiola Torres, her mother Irma Torres and her 
father Gregorio Torres.

 Students Protest 

for Education in Chile   

S     tudent-led demonstrations to reform Chile’s national education system are drawing interna-tional media attention for mob violence and subse-
quent arrests: the BBC reported approximately 900 arrests 
that were made following a 60,000-strong Aug. 4 protest. 
Even with such staggering numbers, all 59 University of 
California Education Abroad Program students studying 
in Santiago have remained in the program and are actively 
attending class at this time, according to UCEAP commu-
nications representative Emilia Doerr. Despite EAP admin-
istration’s warning to avoid protests as a safety precaution, 
some EAP students have even chosen to participate in 
alongside local students. 
      Recent protests interfered with Muir College senior Megan 
Young’s studies at the public university, la Universidad 
de Chile. Young was required to transfer to the private 
university Pontificia Universidad Católica — also located 
in capital city Santiago — for her second semester abroad. 
Young, one of six UCSD students in Chile, describes her 
experience as witnessing history in the making.

  Although Young resides in an apartment in central 
Santiago where the protests are largely concentrated, she 
said she has never felt unsafe.
 “The protests have never affected me in a negative way, 
nor have I ever felt like my life was at risk because of the 
protests,” Young said. “I’ve gone to a few in June and one 

just this morning.”
  Chilean students are protesting the 
privatization of education in the form of 
marches, hunger strikes and tomas, a Spanish 
term that refers to students occupying a 
university building so that the administration 
is unable to function as normal, Young said 
in an email. Tomas are different from sit-ins 

in that they can last for indeterminate periods of time, 
sometimes lasting for months until the protesters’ demands 
are met. 
  The protests — which originated in May — started

By Michael Chang
Staff Writer

     Snape kills Dumbeldore. Tyler 
Durden isn’t real. Soylent Green is 
people. It may be considered a social 
sin to reveal spoilers such as the ones 
previously mentioned, but a recent 
study at UCSD discovered that contrary 
to popular belief, spoilers actually 
enhance one’s reading experience.
     UCSD department of psychology 
graduate student Jonathan Leavitt 
tested the effects of spoilers in short 
stories that have themes including 
ironic twist, mystery and evocative 
literary stories on UCSD students. 
Results show spoilers enhance readers’ 
enjoyment rather than detract from 
them.
     Upon entering UCSD’s graduate 
program with an MFA in writing 
fiction, Leavitt was encouraged to start 
this study by psychology professor 
Nicholas Christenfeld, who helped 
him develop the project. Leavitt and 

Christenfeld began designing the test 
in September of last year — testing and 
analysis of the raw data took months 
to complete. They performed a total 
of three experiments with 12 different 
short stories by authors such as Roald 
Dahl and John Updike.
     To be a part of the study, subjects 
were only required to be fluent and 
able to read in English. Due to such 
simple qualifications, subjects were 
chosen at random. All participants 
received versions of the same story 
that were unspoiled, with a separate 
spoiler on another sheet of paper and 
a version that had a spoiler that was 
put in the beginning, as if it was the 
opening of the story. They would read 
all three versions and rate how much 
they enjoyed each one on a scale of 
one to ten. 
    “We were interested in the 
experience of suspense and why people 
think that the excitement of reading 
a story depends on not knowing the 
ending, but then they reread the same 

stories and can enjoy them just 
as much, even when everything 
is already known,” Leavitt said. 
“You’re focused on outcomes and 
how things will turn out, and that 
gives readers the impression that if 
they already knew how it turned out, 
they would find the story less or not 
interesting.”
     All story genres proved to be more 
enjoyable despite being spoiled.
     “We found very little difference,” 
Leavitt said. “It seemed that what was 
most important was that the spoiler 
was clear and understandable. Across 
different genres, it seems like spoilers 
were making people enjoy stories 
more.”
     The only story that did not benefit 
from being spoiled was Anton 
Chekhov’s The Bet, an ironic twist story. 
However, Leavitt feels that enjoyment 
was reduced not because it was spoiled, 
but because the spoiler was poorly 
written. Readers found the spoiler to 
be difficult to understand and were 

uncertain on how the story would 
end based on the spoiler. The rest of 
the data still indicates that spoilers 
enhance reader enjoyment.
     Leavitt’s next goal is to apply his 
theory to other narrative media and to 
find out why spoilers are having this 
particular effect. He has developed two 
theories to explain the trend.
     “One is that having a spoiler 
makes a story easier to read and 
understand,” Leavitt said. “The other 
theory is that people tend to focus 
on suspense regarding the outcome, 
and once you know how the story will 
end, it enables you to broaden your 
focus and appreciate the other aspects 
of the story, like the language and 
development of characters.”

with what to do in respect to fees.”
   According to the UCOP, such a fee increase would lead 
to increased faculty and enrollment, as well as continued 
investment into expanding academic programs and 
facilities. 
   However, Lansing said that this scenario was less than 
ideal. The percentage of the fee increase is dependent 
on the amount of funding the UC system receives from 
the state. 

According to Lenz and Brostom, the decline in state 
funding began in the 1990-91 academic year, when the 
UC system lost 20 percent of its financial support from 
the state. 

Currently, state support for the UC system is 10 
percent higher, not adjusted for inflation, than the 1990-
91 year, though the number of California high school 
graduates has increased from 68.6 percent in 1990 to 74.4 
percent in 2011, spurring enrollment growth. 
      In 2005, UC and CSU officials entered a six-year 
agreement with Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to have 
the state provide the minimum resources the system 
would need to reaffirm the UC’s high standards for 
education while increasing enrollment with their main 
intentions dependent on institutional accountability and 
state funding. 

The agreement was meant to expire during the 2010-
11 fiscal year but lasted only two years because of the 
state’s budget crisis.
    At the meeting, the Regents also suggested alternate 
methods of raising money, which include an emphasis on 
corporate and alumni donations, as well as seeking new 
tax revenues. 

Other alternatives include planning classes with a 
higher student-faculty ratio and cutting faculty salaries. 
     These alternatives are considered as efforts that 
“would destroy UC’s historic commitment to quality,” the 
Office of the President said in a statement.
    The Regents was scheduled to vote on a new budget 
plan in November 2011, but Lansing said she was 
doubtful the board would be able to decide on a plan by 
then. Vazquez said the earliest the Regents would vote on 
any fee increase would be in January 2012.

and a “Thriller” reenactment. 
However, recent protests have 
furthered divisions between the 
police and the students. According 
to an Aug. 26 story published in 
the Guardian UK, police used tear 
gas and water cannons against 
protesters. 

The same story reports that a 
16-year-old boy was shot in the 
chest during the protests. 
According to local media, witnesses 
said the police were responsible for 
the boy’s death.
   “I have participated in some of the 
protests and am in full support of 
the students,” Warren College senior 
Jordan Dalton said in an email. 
“Many Chilean political concepts 
have been exported from the United 
States and the concept of education 
is no different. Chilean students 
are extremely politically informed, 
especially about the United States.”
     Dalton — who also spent her first 
semester in Chile at la Universidad 
de Chile and is now at Pontificia 
Unviersidad Católica — sees the 
protests as a way for students to 
demand better funding for schools, 
debt reduction for former students 
and an increase in transparency in 
the government. 

While Chilean students are 
organizing and mobilizing largely 
online with social media, Dalton 
said the campus remains an 
important location for debates and 
discussions.
    “A paro [an unauthorized strike] 
doesn’t mean the students don’t 
go to school,” Dalton said. “In a 
well-run paro the students are at 
the university discussing ideas for 
furthering their cause or preparing 
for the next demonstration.”
   Despite frequent UC tuition 
increases drawing criticisms of 
privatizing public education, 
student response has been largely 

underwhelming. The UCSD 
campus didn’t organize for last 
year’s system-wide March 2 event, 
according to a March 3 Guardian 
article titled “Campus Fails 
to Mobilize for March 2 Day of 
Action.” UC students can learn 
something from Chilean students, 
Young said.  
   Young attributes Chilean students’ 
political presence as a response to 
its political history and the 
country’s structure of education — 
the U.S. government supports 35.8 
percent of higher education, while 
Chile’s government supports 14.4 
percent.
   “The government in Chile hasn’t 
been established for as long as 
the United States, so the younger 
generation who didn’t experience 
repression during Pinochet’s regime 
have a kind of fearless hope and 
opinion for their vision of the 
future that they want for their lives,” 
Young said.
    According to Doerr, UCEAP says 
it is too early to say how the nation’s 
events are impacting applications or 
interest for next year. 
Despite the circumstances, Young 
and Dalton both agree that 
witnessing the social movement is 
an important education in and out 
of itself.
    “The student movement has the 
slogan ‘Educación Gratuita y de 
Calidad,’ which means ‘Education 
that is free and of quality,’” Young 
said. “Chile is at a crucial point of 
change, and if we hope to become 
conscious global citizens and take 
a role in shaping the kind of society 
we want as well, it would do a world 
of good to be informed about what’s 
going on and take a leaf out of 
the students’ book to defend what’s 
important on a bigger picture.”

4 THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 22,  2011 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

Moving off campus is great. Not only do you finally have a place to call your 
home away from home, but it’s also 
far, far away from the stifling confines 
of the prison they call on-campus 
housing. So I was jazzed about mov-
ing out, that is, until I kicked in the 
door of my new home and discovered 
that the house was nearly as barren as 
Sarah Jessica Parker. 

I needed furniture. But a quick 
glance at my bank account told me 
that short of rummaging through 
a dumpster, it looked like I would 
be eating my meals whilst squatting 
around an overturned cardboard 
box. And that’s what I did — for the 
first two nights. The next night, my 
friends and I left our dignity in our 
empty house and headed for the 
Costa Verde dumpster.

If you’re disgusted by the idea of 
dumpster furniture, then you obvi-
ously haven’t seen my sweet IKEA 
coffee table (retail value: $50). Or my 
awesome collection of folding deck 
chairs, my roommate’s desk, three 
of my trash cans or the vast array 
of cleaning products that I used to 
scour the furniture of stranger-danger 
germs.

The cherry on top of my furniture 
shopping experience was when I dis-
covered my storage unit had a drop-
off zone for unwanted and forgotten 
junk. There, the phrase “one man’s 
trash, another man’s treasure” rang 
true. I snatched up a gigantic painting 
of the Grand Canyon that would tear 
down a section of drywall if I tried to 
hang it up. Ah, the aesthetics of inte-
rior decoration.

If you’re actually going to take this 
column seriously and you’re currently 
en route to the nearest dumpster, 
flashlight in hand, keep these tips in 
mind: 

Only look in dumpsters near large 
apartment complexes during popular 
move-out and move-in days. There, 
you are more likely to find actual fur-
niture than dozens of not-so-carefully 
tied up bags of food scraps and mold. 
People who simply can’t cram their 
beloved desk vanity into the moving 
truck will often tearfully toss it in the 
nearby dumpster. And nothing says 
vanity like a dumpster, right?

Please, for the love of god, don’t 
take anything home that has a cloth 
surface. Ignore that heavily broken-
in mattress — just assume that it’s 
riddled with bed bugs and unsightly 
stains that you wouldn’t want to con-
front under a black light. 

Cleaning is key. Your stockpile 
of Clorox will finally pay itself off 
handsomely — anticipate devoting 
the next hour or so to cleaning your 
newly acquired treasures. Some of 
your furniture may have come from 
a dumpster, but if you want to effec-
tively impress, not repulse your guests 
with just how miserly you are, clean 
up. 

When I stop to think about it, 
dumpster diving is a revolting con-
cept. But after taking a long look at 
my thoroughly cleaned, completely 
free swag, I decide to take pride in 
doing the impossible: I’ve managed to 
out-hipster the guy who got his desk 
chair at the local Salvation Army.

School may have been out for the summer, but political develop-ments took no break. Among the 
relevant — the UC Board of Regents 
announced further tuition increases, 
Marye Anne Fox announced her plan 
to step down as UCSD’s chancellor in 
the following year and Gov. Jerry Brown 
signed the first half of the California 
Dream Act into play while the second 
half awaits his signature. 

Tuition Woes Increase

For anyone tracking the financial sta-
tus of the University of California, one 
thing is clear: This year is the beginning 
of the end. For the first time, the UC 
system is receiving more income from 
student tuition than state funding, a 
development that points to the increas-
ing privatization of our university. In 
2011 alone, income from tuition has 
risen $360 million, and according to the 
Los Angeles Times and the UC Board 
of Regents, it’s only going to go up. On 
top of a 30-percent tuition increase since 
2009, the Regents, as of Sept. 15, are 
considering a further 8 to 16-percent 
increase over the next four years.

UCSD is attempting to raise income 
through tried-and-true methods. This 
year, 18 percent of UCSD’s freshman 
class comes from outside California — 
an admittance rate up 36 percent from 
last year. While the higher tuitions of 
out-of-state students may increase fund-
ing, this solution shuts in-state students 
out of a UC education. The unprofitable 
(read: mostly humanities) university 
programs that face the deepest cuts 
will look to private funding to escape 
extinction, an attempt that mirrors the 
University of Michigan’s use of private 
help to keep their business school afloat.

Despite these grim reminders — 
there is still hope. Student action has 
yielded definitive budgetary changes in 
colleges such as San Diego State. When 
SDSU’s new president was offered a sala-
ry that was a $100,000 increase from his 
predecessor, protests over this issue led 
to a review of state educational salaries 
and a cap on CSU president salaries. 

While student activism has proven 
successful for SDSU and could indeed 
galvanize action at UCSD, students and 
the UC Regents have options beyond 
marches and demonstrations. Three-
year degrees and less stringent general 
education requirements are valid plans 
that have the potential to save the UC 

system. The options are out there. Now 
it’s just a matter of taking action.  

Chancellor Steps Down

Over the summer, Chancellor Marye 
Anne Fox announced plans to renounce 
her administrative position and return 
to the chemistry classroom after seven 
years on the job — eight years after 
June 2012, when she is scheduled to set 
down. Given that the average tenure of 
a chancellor is 4.5 years, she’s been here 
longer than most university leaders.

Which isn’t to say her tenure wasn’t 
successful.

Since her appointment in 2004, 
UCSD has launched $3.5 billion in con-
struction projects — among them, Fox 
achieved her goal of building transfer 
housing. Recognition followed suit: 
Awards have been bestowed upon the 
UCSD community — Nobel, Pulitzer 
and MacArthur prizes — and Fox 
received the National Medal of Science 
at the White House last fall. 

But Fox’s tenure wasn’t all sunshine 
and awards. Budget cuts, rising student 
fees and racial conflict were the source 
of heated protests, and we lost three top 
professors to Rice University because 
they offered them more money — a 
clear step backward for us academically.

Most notably, the “Compton 
Cookout” and the string of racially 
charged incidents that followed in 
February 2010 left UCSD students with 
an indelible image of their university 
and those who run it. The Black Student 
Union roared outside the Chancellor’s 
Complex that winter, demanding that 
Fox address the lack of support and out-
reach for minority students.

That’s the kind of job that can wear a 
former professor out.

So as much as Fox has done for 
UCSD, it’s fair to expect her successor 
to be someone who understands the 
demands of the job. Preferably, the new 
chancellor can focus on internal con-
flicts like those that shaped Winter 2010, 
before they turn into national news, in 
addition to keeping the university com-
petitive.

The big successes for UCSD 
—  acclaim, high-enrollment, big-budget 
projects — aren’t as bright in the face of 
student unrest. Now that we’re paying 
more for our education than ever, it’s 
time students demanded some input in 
the choice of our leader and figurehead 
— or at least choice in the issues we

Summer in Review
Tuition increases, a chancellor departure and equal access for undocumented students have at least one 

thing in common — they will have an untold impact on students at UCSD in the coming year.

THE MENTAL FISHBOWL By Alex Nguyen 

Dream Act a Worthy Investment in Student Minority

Dear Editor,
Articles written by American 

newspapers have suggested that the 
Chilean protests are dangerous and 
are hindering American foreign 
exchange students from advancing 
in their studies. As a UCSB student 
studying at a public university in 
Santiago, I feel the reverse, that this is 
a unique educational opportunity. Isn’t 
that the most important part of study-
ing abroad — to experience a foreign 
culture?  Otherwise, why not stay in 
the comfort zone of your home uni-
versity? While studying in a foreign 
place, you will be adjusting and adapt-
ing daily to the new culture around 
you. We “viejos” (second semester 
students) who were around when the 
strikes started, had an adjustment 
period, but we now accept it as just 
one more adjustment that comes with 
the territory.

It is a historic time in Chilean 
history, and I am lucky to witness it 
firsthand, learning more outside the 
classroom than inside. Every Chilean 
is current on the student protests, 
whether they agree with them or not. 
They will give you a history lesson 
about the past forty years to explain 
the value of democracy in Chile. They 
are an incredibly informed public, far 
more than the majority of Americans. 
Even more sadly, the average Chilean 
probably knows more about American 
politics than the American public.

Is it possible to study in Santiago? 
Absolutely. Though the Chilean stu-
dents are on strike, foreign students 
are still obligated to attend class, as are 
the professors, who are not officially 
on strike. While there definitely were 
nuisances in trying to arrange semes-
ter schedules, the directors of EAP 
Chile and the international students 
offices at the universities are working 

diligently to ensure that everyone has 
enough classes to meet their educa-
tional goals, including the option of 
special studies projects with Chilean 
professors to make up for classes that 
were cancelled. 

Compared to California, the class 
size can’t be beat. When was the last 
time all your classes contained two to 
five students? We know our professors 
on a personal level and have more 
flexibility in the class. Open discus-
sion is the norm, making classes more 
interesting and creating a supportive 
environment for those still learning 
Spanish. 

Students in California could learn 
a lesson from the Chilean youth. UC 
tuition has risen more than 75 percent 
in three years. Our higher education 
system has tanked. Classes are being 
cancelled, majors/minors are dropped 
and students crashing over-enrolled 
classes is now a way of life.

But the difference is, they are  
doing something about it. The student 
demonstrations are all about provid-
ing affordable, quality education for 
every Chilean. Rather than feel incon-
venienced by the protests, American 
students should take advantage of this 
moment in Chilean history! Spend 
your time observing how students can 
democratically make a difference in 
improving the educational system that 
is failing them. Even more important, 
bring those lessons back to the U.S.

Senate Passes Dream Act

In the midst of many politi-
cal developments this summer 
(California redistricting, the debt ceil-
ing crisis) came a big win for undocu-
mented students. Assembly Bill 130 
passed through Congress, giving said 
students access to privately funded 
scholarships.

It’s a great victory for undocu-
mented students, but it’s not over 
yet. Assembly Bill 131, a sister bill 
that would grant undocumented stu-
dents access to state scholarships and 

grants, is now waiting on Gov. Jerry 
Brown’s signature. Brown’s initial 
support for the bill is waning due to 
the bill’s potential strain on the state 
budget, but that hasn’t stopped both 
sides from rehashing old — but per-
fectly legitimate — arguments. One 
side stands by the reasonable asser-
tion that the state barely has enough 
money in its coffers to support its 
legal citizens — much less a wave of 
undocumented ones.

The other side, and the side we 
ultimately fall on, claims that the state 
investment in undocumented stu-
dents would pay off in the long run. 
Many of these students did not come 
to this country of their own volition, 
and because they already have roots 
here, an education is the solid boost 
they need to become a productive 

member of society. This has already 
been proven with rulings in Plyer v. 
Doe and the passage of Assembly Bill 
540, which allows undocumented 
students access to California public 
schools through the 12th grade and 
in-state tuition rates for state col-
leges, respectively. Not allowing these 
students to finish what they (and the 
state) have started will only damage 
the state economy and push these stu-
dents into a permanent lower class.

Even if the bill is signed, the battle 
is far from over. These bills may give 
undocumented students a freshly 
minted college degree, but they still 
won’t be citizens — that’s still under 
Congressional jurisdiction. But until 
then, passing AB 131 will be a worthy 
step towards creating a more inclusive 
American dream.

One week in, and I can already tell my first, and likely last, online dating account (on the 
popular website OkCupid) is the best 
possible version of myself. Yes, I chose 

a flattering photo. Yes, I refrained 
from including the sarcastic answers 
I personally find endearing, but are 
undeniably interpreted as bitchy 
to those that are not well versed in 
Grade-A Los Angeles sass. And yes, 
I did click the button that said I like 
dogs even though I don’t, in fact, like 
dogs. I can tolerate them.  

But so far online dating has been 
anything but difficult. Talk about 
myself (no problem), answer numer-
ous nonsensical emails (that’s basically 
my everyday job description) and get 
hit on — all from the comfort of my 
own home. 

The notion of online dating came 
about when a fellow Guardian editor 
asked me to share my thoughts on 
the phenomenon. I wasn’t sure if her 
question was prompted due to her 
own personal manhunt (turns out that 
it was) or if it was her sneaky way of 
proposing a column idea (it was not, 
but so it became). I quickly replied 
to her instant message with a “don’t 
knock it ‘till you try it” type response, 
along with the personal note that I 
had not tried it thus far due to my 
lingering “hopeless romantic senti-
ment.” Now, this sentiment definitely 
still exists. But if I find my Romeo in 
a trite yet intimate Parisian scene or 
over a cup of coffee at Pete’s (in broad 
daylight might I add), isn’t he Romeo 
nonetheless? 

But once I created my profile, I 
quickly began to notice some things 
about the slew of twenty-something 
San Diego boys online. First, I learned 
that intuition is going to be a key fac-
tor in making this experience success-
ful. With only a few hundred words 
and a handful of photos to make a 
decent first impression, many of these 
guys aren’t using their best judgment 
when it comes to leaving out details 
about their World of Warcraft habits 
and choosing photos that aren’t taken 
in front of their bathroom mirrors. 

After some browsing, I next real-
ized that my intuition is more shallow 
than I’d like to admit. I began to won-
der if these men even lead lives out-
side of their laptops. But if anything, 
OkCupid was to blame. After taking 
a few personal quiz questions (i.e. 
Would you rather be the big spoon or 
little spoon? Do you believe in God? 
etc.), the website quickly weeds out 
all the potential suitors that don’t fit 
your interests through their matching 
process. So once I answered my fair 
share of questions, I was left with a 
long list of atheist big spoons and the 
only thing left to do was look at their 
photos. How could you not be superfi-
cial?  All the work was done for me. 

Now before we get too far into 
this social experiment, let’s get a few 
things clear. I will not openly discuss 
said newspaper column with said dates 
but I will not lie about my affiliation

AND

CONSEQU
ENCES

For both newbie freshmen and wizened old-timers, the hangover is an inevitable consequence of a night of the true college experience. While the nausea, headaches, fatigue and 
general sense of dread are rarely enough to convince you to give 
your binge-drinking the boot, not being able to finish the three 
MMW papers you wisely decided to leave off until the day before 
can be apt reason to figure out some new tricks for dealing with 
the morning after.

But before you start eating burnt toast and taking more shots, 
tune into the advice of two San Diego bartenders, David and Tina 
Abott*. David and Tina, who respectively have five and six years 
of experience behind the bar, dished in (with their fair share of 
disagreement) on the specific hangovers caused by common col-
lege drinks, as well as which tricks they use to ensure a smooth 
recovery. 

VODKA

David says that because of its purity, high-quality vodka won’t 
give you the nausea that other liquors will, but the high concentra-
tion of alcohol makes for greater dehydration, which, as the shots 
add up, will probably cause an aching headache later on. To avoid 
the worst, however, steer clear of the cheap stuff.

SUGARY COCKTAILS

Both Tina and David also agree that the sugary, fruit cocktails 
are the worst concoctions when it comes to hangovers. “Sugar

RESTAURANT REVIEW •  BY ARIELLE SALLAI

THE BISTRO

A s much as the average college student might enjoy a tastefully prepared meal, Ramen noodles 
will always reign supreme. Sure, price has 
everything to do with it, but there’s some-
thing to be said for the delight of dripping 
powder-flavored broth over that chem 
textbook mid slurp-and-study. The Bistro 
at the Strand — UCSD Housing, Dining 
& Hospitality’s first full-service, sit-down 
restaurant (that takes meal points!) — 
aims to change that, giving 
the dorm-room staple and 
college dining in general a 
serious upgrade.

Plus, as part of the newly 
revamped Village Housing, 
just past Eleanor Roosevelt 
College on the far north 
corner of campus, The Bistro 
has the swanky decor to 
match. Modern, surprisingly 
comfortable pod chairs, shiny 
windows all around and fur-
nishing that’s inspired more 
by IKEA than by the restaurant’s self-pro-
fessed Asian roots, create an atmosphere 
perfect for the cheap freshman who wants 
to use meal points on a first date.

Among the more traditional Pan-
Asian options, the Angus beef sliders ($9) 
are a surprising standout. Topped with 
mild kimchee slaw and an artisan potato 
roll, served with taro chips on the side, 
they are packed with some serious flavor, 

especially compared to the dry patties 
dished up at other on-campus eateries. 
The slaw, also served on the side, only 
works in the two mega-juicy burgers; oth-
erwise it’s just spice-less cabbage.

The soba noodles with lemongrass 
shrimp skewer ($10) are less recom-
mendable. The heavy noodles have a 
disarmingly heavy wheat flavor and the 
vegetarian broth, carrots, snow peas, red 
bell pepper and baby bok choy do little 

to cover up the cardboard-like 
taste. Fortunately, the Bistro does 
well with meats, and the shrimp 
skewer has enough bite for the 
rest of the dish.

The spicy red curry seared 
tofu ($9) is a good choice for 
vegetarians on a menu that’s 
mostly carnivore-dominated. 
It’s tofu for those who fear tofu 
— completely smothered in the 
right amount of pungent sauce.

The service is schizophrenic 
— during our dining experi-

ence, the staff flitted from looks of pure 
naivete to sheer disdain as they attempted 
to make it through a seemingly manage-
able rush — but that’s to be expected from 
an under-staffed, new eatery with only a 
crop of stressed-out students to hire from. 
We’ll give the Bistro some time to grow; 
for now, it’s still a pleasant alternative to 
the dining hall fried chicken otherwise 
available.

always hurts,” David said. Sugar makes for greater absorption of 
alcohol, and the mix of all the artificial fruit flavorings will not 
bode well on your stomach after the third margarita, adding nausea 
to the headache that has already been caused by the liquor.

BEER

Each body will have it’s own physical reaction to various brands 
of beer, but overdoing any brew will give you a more nauseous 
hangover the next day. Due to its gaseous nature and the fact that it 
expands your stomach as the night goes on, a beer-induced hang-
over will probably consist of more stomach pain and nausea than 
anything else. As for which brand, Tina sticks to Coors while David 
prefers Budweiser. It’s all about personal taste and limiting yourself 
to what you can handle.

AVOIDING AND CURING HANGOVERS

“Have some Jaeger and Redbull, and then drink water,” Tina 
recommends. “It counteracts the 
effects of the hangover. The ‘bomb’ 
part of it really gets you up and any 
caffeine helps with the headache.” 

Commonly known as “eating the 
hair of the dog that bit you,” drink-
ing more alcohol the next morning 
is generally thought to be a bad idea, 
succeeding only in putting off your 
hangover symptoms until later.

“It makes the eventual hangover 
go by more smoothly,” David admits, 
although he doesn’t personally abide by 
the Jaegerbomb remedy. His own trick 
is waking up in the morning, taking 
Tylenol with plenty of water and going 
back to sleep. “It’s good to hydrate and 
just sleep a lot of it off.”

Admittedly, the best way to cure a 
hangover is to avoid it entirely, Tina 
said. “If you know you’ll be drink-
ing, get a couple Gatorades and pop them in the fridge. If you can 
manage to pound them in before you go to bed, you won’t wake 
up with such a bad hangover.” She also recommends that for every 
drink consumed, you accompany it with a cup of water. “When I’m 
at the bar and I see someone drinking a lot, I’ll just slide them a 
water,” she said.

Both say that the most important thing is to know your own 
drinking limitations. All it takes is some planning. “Be conscien-
tious of what you’re drinking,” Tina said. “Know your limit and 
what works best for you, and just stick to that, and you’ll be fine.”

with the Guardian (because let’s be 
real, that’s usually the first thing my 
subconscious blathers out). And I will 
in no way sacrifice my personal mor-
als for the sake of this column. That 
means I will not send or positively 
respond to winky face emoticons. I 
will not have sex on the first date and 
I will in no circumstance respond to 
someone whose profile states they 
are good at “playing with yo’ vaginal 
receptacle!” (true story) or with the 
initial message “hey dorky! you the 
random type?” (also another pain-
fully true story). And I will carry 
pepper spray. 

As a young woman on a dat-
ing website, much of my experi-
ence was predestined. A week into 
my OkCupid experience, I had 
already done exactly what one of the 
cofounders of OkCupid would later 
suggest in his welcome email; I had 
contacted the guys I was interested in.

With a plethora of men that 
seemed less than appealing, I had 
found a grand total of two guys I 
found both attractive and interesting. 
I did my best to reply to the litter of 
suspiciously vague yet complimen-
tary messages from users on the site 
(many of which I later compared 
with coworkers’ messages to find 
that the ambiguity was a mere way 
of disguising a mass message we had 
all received). But the two coffee dates 
I’ve already set up upon my return 
to San Diego were both initiated by 
me. So loyal readers, wish me luck 
as I embark on the dubious journey 
that is online dating. And if I miss my 
deadline or don’t answer my phone, 
just know that I was last seen with 
musicluvr21 from Escondido.

or two days, female musical 
comedy duo Garfunkel & 
Oates brainstormed what a 
penis looks like. The girls, 

actresses Riki Lindhome (Garfunkel, 
32) and Kate Micucci (Oates, 30), 
were writing the lyrics for I Dont 
Understand Job  a little ditty about 
uncovering the mysteries of third base. Their 
mission: A clever way of describing male geni-
talia.

They eventually settled on Silly Putty Pac 
Man ghost and Darth Vader Pez dispenser, 
though the song still took them a total of five 
months to write, Lindhome told the Guardian 
during a phone call from Los Angeles.

Sometimes things will just come to us, 
Lindhome said. It will be quick. Well write it in 
an hour and then maybe rewrite it the next day. 
And then sometimes its a five-month process.

Clearly, Garfunkel & Oates are serious about 
their dick jokes.

I thought, Wouldnt it be funny if we had 
a Nixon reference, followed by Watergate, fol-
lowed by Spiro Agnew, followed by Lyndon 
Johnson? Lindhome said, remembering the 
inspiration for one of the verses of I Dont 
Understand Job. And then you spend like three 
days on those lines.

But despite their current dedication, 
Garfunkel & Oates was never in either of the 

performers career plans. 
Both Lindhome and Micucci 
moved to LA from the east 
coast �(Lindhome from 
Portville, N.Y. and Micucci 
from Nazareth, Pa.) to pursue 
careers in acting. Since then, 
Lindhome has appeared in 

films such as Million Dollar Baby and the 
remake of The Last House on the Left, while 
Micucci is best known for her ukulele-playing 
character Stephanie Gooch on Scrubs.

They were first introduced at the Upright 
Citizens Brigade improv theatre in 2006, where 
they were going to see a friends show so we 
met in the audience and became friends really 
quickly, Lindhome said.

A few years later Lindhome wrote and 
directed a short film for the two of them to star 
in, decided to turn it into a musical and asked 
Micucci to co-write songs with her. And so 
Garfunkel & Oates was born.

Acting was always the primary focus, 
Lindhome said. [Garfunkel & Oates] kind of 
just unfolded. And once it did unfold, some 
people thought we fell into it. Which is true ... 
But then after that we were like, Were really 
going to do this! and we really worked our asses 
off for this thing.

Since then, Garfunkel & Oates has racked up 
millions of views on YouTube for their bitterly 

sweet, ukulele-laced songs, caught the atten-
tion of CNN (for their pro-gay marriage video, 
Sex With Ducks), performed on The Tonight 
Show and landed monthly gigs at Upright 
Citizens Brigade  making them staples of the 
LA alternative comedy scene.

Most notably, the duo signed a contract 
with HBO for a pilot show. Theyre currently 
developing the script, but things just take a lot 
longer than we thought, Lindhome said.

Theyve envisioned it as the female version of 
Flight of the Conchords   or Glee with dick 
jokes, as Lindhome has taken to describing it.

I think its kind of like an extension of our 
stage show, where its two single girls in LA 
trying to make it, she said. But its us like five 
years ago, so we arent recognized yet or getting 
paid at all.

For now, theyll continue turning the sub-
jects of their girl talk into matter-of-fact songs 
like fan-favorites, Pregnant Women Are Smug, 
Go Kart Racing (Accidentally Masturbating) 
and This Party Took a Turn for the Douche.

But not every subject can be made into a 
hilarious-ukelele jam.

People give us song ideas all the time, and 
well consider them, but they dont realize that 
it has to fill out three minutes, Lindhome said. 
Facebook, blind dates, parents, holidays  
you name it and it has been brainstormed and 
rejected by us.

Tim, Eric and 
the War on 
Humor
H umor isnt funny. When youve second-guessed friendships discussing The Big Lebowski 
and can respectably choose a life partner 
based on a good sense of humor, clearly, 
it is some serious shit. And though wed 
like to believe in putting our differences 
aside to see our Christopher Guest in 

their Larry the Cable Guy, its just impos-
sible. What makes us laugh is a reflection 
of ourselves  one that we loyally defend 
despite the criticism of unfazed naysayers. 

Case in point: Tim and Eric 
Awesome Show, Great Job!, the surrealis-
tic sketch show/prolonged nightmare and 
brainchild of creators Tim Heidecker and 
Eric Wareheim. Wrongfully dismissed 
as yet another ADHD stoner-gag exhibi-
tion in Cartoon Networks Adult Swim 
lineup, Awesome Show is a landmark 
not only in cult television, but the dawn 
of a new kind of humor altogether  one 
that insists on doling laughter, confusion, 
anger and terror in equal measure. 

Call it stubbornness, but I was never 
one to turn fanboy for any one fad 
(except, Ill admit, a three-year dedica-
tion to Weird Al Yankovic in middle 
school). And when I first experienced 
Awesome Show  the cast of off-the-
street weirdos, John C. Reilly as disturbed 
anchorman Dr. Steve Brule  I was 
entertained but hardly addicted. 

Yet, the more Tim and Eric I casually 
consumed, the more difficult it became 
to resist. Their bizarre musical numbers, 
invented holidays and public access com-
mercials all shone with a brilliant new set 
of comedic standards that television had 
been somehow missing altogether.

But, as is the bitter pill of any cult fol-
lower, the glaring judgment poured in 
from all sides. 

Random and disgusting became 
dirty words, spat from the ignorant 
mouth of the non-convert. And while 
a couple of lawless teens sticking it to 
the man by eating their own boogers in 
a musical PSA may not be an attractive 
image, the latter accusation is particularly 
aggravating when you consider the shit 
that actually passes for entertainment.

Take for example the episode of Two 
and a Half Men when the lovably per-
verted Charlie, after considering sleeping 
with a pregnant woman, proclaims, Just 
because theres a bun in the oven doesnt 
mean I want to butter it. The hasty laugh 
track is answered by the Pavlovian guf-
faws of some 14 million home viewers 
who all seem to ignore that the notion 
of ejaculating onto an unborn fetus is far 
more disturbing and morally reprehensi-
ble than digging for that proverbial gold. 

Granted, Awesome Show is des-
ignated for its target audience. But its 
sheer creativity is hard to dismiss while 
much of mainstream comedy television 
is beginning to resemble one long, Office-
inspired mumblecore-like sitcom. �

If our tastes mature but never really 
change (of course Weird Al became an 
Awesome Show regular), Tim and Erics 
upcoming feature film, though propped 
upon a cast of big comedy names like 
Will Ferrell and Zach Galafianakis, will 
likely do nothing to change the face of 
mainstream comedy. But the devout will 
continue to celebrate the duos demented 
creations in the face of our unamused 
and therefore inferior peers, keeping alive 
what is so intrinsically our own.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 22,  2011 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG 9

Predicting the future is dif-
ficult. But Parisian space-dance 
quartet Chateau Marmont appreci-
ates the attempt. 

“I think it’s a mix between two 
periods,” founder/keyboardist 
Guillaume de Maria said about 
Chateau Marmont’s retro-futuristic 
sound. “We are big collectors of 
analog synths. The way they are 
built, the way they look, the way 
they sound — it reminds us of old 
sci-fi movies.” 

The music video for the band’s 
motorik, vocoder-doused “One 
Hundred Realities” stunningly 
captures this fondness of the new 
as told by the old. Japanese direc-
tor Shinya Sato’s hazy, black and 
white scenes of animated marbles 
against kaleidoscopic astral back-

drops resemble some lost “Twilight 
Zone” experiment.

“Shinya is in a band called 
Crystal, and they released an EP 
on our label,” de Maria said. “We 
loved them, they 
were really nice and 
we knew that Shinya 
was making a lot of 
videos. He told us 
the concept and we 
were really excited, 
so we gave him carte 
blanche. When we 
watched it we were 
like, ‘Wow, this is 
really how we imag-
ined the music.’”

But Chateau Marmont’s 
electronic tendencies mark a 
fairly recent venture for the band, 
spurred by an interest in remix-
ing mainstream pop songs. Their 
downplayed, spaced-out remixes 
of La Roux’s “Quicksand” and 
Ladyhawke’s “My Delirium” man-
aged to breach France’s competitive 
electronic scene. 

“In 2009 we were making a lot 

of remixes,” de Maria said. “More 
than original songs. We kept the 
main voice of the song and we 
managed to compose and build 
around that voice. At the time we 

were not very good 
singers, so we had 
a real voice from a 
real song. We started 
using our drum 
machines more, and 
at the same time we 
signed our first EP 
to a very famous 
electronic French 
label, Institubes.”

After record-
ing a new LP and making their 
U.S. debut at South by Southwest 
this summer, the band plans on 
remaining in the States. 

“In Paris, people are not very 
open-minded,” said de Maria. “In 
the U.S. you can play for young 
people or old people and they all 
have a good time. We’re really 
looking forward to coming to 
California.”

Girls
Father, Son, Holy Ghost
TRUE PANTHER 
SOUNDS

A followup to the fantastic debut Album and 
the equally impressive 
Broken Dreams Club EP, 
Girls Father, Son, Holy 
Ghost offers up the same 
60s rock sound  only 
now with incorporated 
string orchestrations and 
a gospel choir  with a 
confident, well-produced 
finish. 

Honey Bunny, the 
upbeat surf-rock open-
ing track, is most remi-
niscent of Girls previous 
releases. The sunny gui-
tar and rumbling drums, 
highlighted with backing 
gospel harmonies, works 
as a great transition 
before Father, Son, Holy 
Ghost begins to explore 
its country, gospel and 
soul undertones more 
deeply. 

Die borrows ele-
ments of 80s metal, 
using a distorted guitar 
intro to lead straight 
into an aggressive head-
bobbing riff reminiscent 
of Black Sabbath  a 
completely new stylistic 
venture for the band. 
Meanwhile, Christopher 
Owens fragile and 
pained lyrics assure that 
no, nothings gonna 
be okay and were all 
gonna die. 

The sentiment marks 
a transition from Owens 
yearning for love to his 
acceptance of failed 
dreams. 

But Father also has its 
share of Girls expected 
tenderheartedness. On 
the dreamy gospel My 
Ma, shimmering electric 
guitars float in a cho-
rus of angelic backing 
vocals. Easily the most 
powerful track on the 
album, My Ma reveals 
Owens strive for hap-
piness and love, as his 
honest, half-whispering 
voice weaves through 
the four-minute track. �

Following suit with 
the nostalgic styles 
and forlorn themes, 
Forgiveness presents 
the peak of Fathers 
passion. The tracks 
country-ballad style, full 
of spacious guitar and 
slow, acoustic strums, 
details Owens most 
straightforward thoughts 
of forgiveness from his 
own family. 

The eight-minute 
epic strives to bring 
positive out of lifes 
struggles while con-
ceding that bad news 
is something tough to 
ignore and forget.

A more frustrated, 
technically mature story 
of love and heartbreak, 
Father, Son, Holy Ghost s 
hook-filled gems create 
a flawless soundtrack to 
the first crushes and lost 
loves of a summer long 
forgotten.

Here’s your money back/ Here’s your punk rock back!"

By Angela ChenNews Editor
Student media heads are threatening legal 

action against A.S. President Utsav Gupta’s for his 
Friday-afternoon decision to freeze all funding to 
student publications.Gupta announced Friday morning that he 

wished to pull funding from controversial humor 
newspaper the Koala, whose editor in chief made 
a racial slur on Student-Run Television the night 
before in reference to Black Student Union mem-
bers protesting the Feb. 15 “Compton Cookout.”

“We’ve tried, throughout this year, to redo [the 
media guidelines], and essentially not fund [the 
Koala],” he said at an impromptu meeting. I don’t 
know if it’ll get rid of them, but on the part of A.S., 
we can defund them — we absolutely can defund 
them, and I believe we must defund them.”

Gupta said he had the executive power to 
freeze media-org funding because the current 
allocation of money for media organizations vio-
lates Section II of the A.S. Constitution. The sec-
tion states the role of the council is “to create and 
execute programs which serve the collective inter-
ests of the undergraduate population.” According 
to Gupta, the current system — which has funded 
the Koala since 1982— is hurting students, and 
therefore not serving the collective interest.

Foundation for Individual Rights in Education 
and American Civil Liberties Union have

Two years after the grand opening 

of Price Center East, University 
Centers officials said they are in the 
final stages of filling the remaining 
store spaces with a bank, coffee shop, 
and hair salon, as they promised.Price Center East opened in May 

2008, funded by the Price Center 
Expansion Referendum — a $39 
quarterly student fee enacted in Spring 

Quarter 2003. Only five vendors have 
been installed in the space since its 
opening, leaving three vacant slots.“The students wanted the best of 

both worlds,” Assistant Vice  Chancellor 
of Student Life Gary Ratcliff said. 
“They wanted an expansion that was 
going to be large enough to serve the 
student body when we reached steady 
state enrollment, and they wanted the 
fee as low as possible. What that meant

A week after
 A.S. Counci

l first 

met to appoi
nt the 2010-1

1 associ-

ate vice presid
ents, one of t

he three 

remaining pos
itions is still un

filled — 

leaving the co
uncil to enter 

next year 

without a full
 cabinet of 10

 AVPs in 

charge of ma
naging variou

s aspects 

of student life
. 

On May 26, 
the council v

oted 

against appoin
ting A.S. Presid

ent Wafa 

Ben Hassine’s 
nominations f

or three 

AVP position
s. The nomin

ations of 

former Campu
swide Senator

 Desiree 

Prevo for the A
VP of Academ

ic Affairs 

position, and 
former AVP 

of Local 

Affairs Aries 
Yumul for the

 AVP of 

College Affair
s position we

re voted 

down, while
 the nomin

ation of 

Eleanor Roose
velt College so

phomore 

Arohi Sharma
 for the AVP o

f Student 

Advocacy posi
tion was tabled

. 

On June 3, th
e council app

roved 

Prevo and Sha
rma to tempo

rarily fill 

the Academic
 Affairs and 

Student 

Advocacy po
sitions, resp

ectively. 

They will car
ry out the AV

P posi-

tions until We

at which poin
t applications

 for the 

position will r
eopen. 

The position 
of AVP of Co

llege 

Affairs was no
t discussed an

d will not 

be filled until 
Fall Quarter. 

According to
 Ben Hassin

e, all 

three position
s were tabled

 at the 

Campus Affai
rs committee 

meeting, 

which is held
 prior to the

 council 

meeting. From
 that, the Ac

ademic 

Affairs and S
tudent Advoc

acy posi-

tions were pul
led out of com

mittee to 

be discussed a
t the meeting.

 

Ben Hassine 
said the posi

tions 

were tabled —
 and then vot

ed down 

—  because 
councilmemb

ers dis-

agreed with th
e process of c

hoosing 

members for 
the selection 

commit-

tee. The select
ion committee

 consists 

of the preside
nt, the outgo

ing AVP 

and three to fo

In less th

to continue op

ever, despite o

uch-hyped 

reopening this
 Winter Quart

s has increased

 its debt over 

$35,000, to a t

“One of the th

UCSD Medica

id. “We’re 

asking for brea

. That’s a 

nurse that com

hes your

The protest, sl
ated to be the l

argest

will also 

include an ad
ditional 14,00

0 nurs-

es from Calif

.

California law
 requires hos

pitals 

to maintain 
at least one 

nurse for 

every three to
 five patients,

 depend-

ing on the ca
re the patient

The union sa
id it wants to

 mandate 

stronger enfo

and establish s
afe ratios at al

According to 
Webb, the me

centers do not
 have enough 

nurses to 

attend the pat

 “We’ve been
 having mee

tings 

with hospitals
 that say they

 already 

have charge

maintain the 

ratio on

However, in a

the UC Office

“The univers

Students from 50 states and 90 countries congregated on 
campus for the Clinton Global Initiative University this week-
end, held April 1 to 3. �e conference is devoted to developing 
and implementing projects (called commitments) to global 
issues, such as poverty, pollution, LGBT rights and college af-
fordability.  

About 1,200 students entered the conference with individ-
ual commitments, 200 of which were from UCSD.  Students 
were required to apply to be participate.

�e Clinton Global Initiative is part of the Clinton Foun-
dation, founded by former U.S. president Bill Clinton in 2005.  
Now hosting its fourth conference, the CGIU has been to uni-
versities in New Orleans, Texas and Miami.  

Clinton was on hand for the weekends event, and other 
guests included Qualcomm CEO Paul Jacobs, actor Sean Penn 
and singer Mandy Moore.  Jacobs participated in the opening 
session, while Moore spoke at the �rst workshop on global 
health and Penn appeared at the closing session. Students were 
also able to attend a variety of panels and workshops to prepare 
them to ful�ll their commitment to face issues such as popula-
tion growth, the environment and global health.

You believe you can make a di�erence, and were going 
to help you, Clinton said at the April 1 opening session. �e 
most important question is how do you propose to do it [com-
mitment] and college students are more prone for that ques-
tion.

CGI U Campus Representative Melissa Etehad, who at-
tended CGI U in Miami last year, expressed her excitement 
over the events international scope.

Its an international event for UCSD, and imagine 200 stu-
dents changing the world, Etehad said. I am so excited for the

Carlsbad resident Julio Angel Garcia-Puente, 50, 
will go to trial for murder and arson charges following 
a hearing held March 30. He is suspected of killing his 
estranged wife  38-year-old Lorena Gonzalez, whose 
body was found in a burning vehicle in the P701 
parking lot next to the UCSD baseball field.

At the preliminary hearing to determine if probable 
cause exists to indict Garcia-Puente, San Diego 

Superior Court Judge Jeffrey Fraser 
concluded that the prosecutors 
provided sufficient evidence for the 
case to stand trial, the San Diego 
Union-Tribune reported on March 
30.

San Diego firefighters testified 
that they arrived in the parking lot 

at approximately 8:30 p.m., when they 
found the vehicle in flames. According to the Union-
Tribune, firefighter Justin Price said that when he 
opened one of the car doors, he saw a head and an 
arm. Investigators determined that the vehicle was 
intentionally set on fire.

According to the Union-Tribune, deputy district 
attorney Nicole Rooney testified that Gonzalez died 
of strangulation, as three bones in her neck were

A
fter five months of planning, A.S. Concerts and Events 
Media Liaison Oliver Zhang sat down with the Guardian 
Sunday afternoon to leak the lineup for the annual Sun 
God Festival.

For me, its the best lineup weve ever had, Zhang said of the 
May 13 festival. 

Rapper Wiz Khalifa will be headlining the main stage, while 
Jesse F. Keeler (JFK) of electronic music duo MSTRKRFT will be 
the main act at the dance tent. 

Best Coast, Mike Posner, Jimmy Eat World and Crystal Castles 
will also play the main stage. The support for the dance tent  as 

well as one more act for the main stage  will be revealed once 
the artist contracts are completed.

Not all contracts are fully executed, Zhang said. When we 
release something we want to make sure that the contracts are 
fully valid, just in case they back out at the last minute.

Associate Vice President of Concerts and Events Brian Wong 
said he is proud of the lineup.

We knew coming into this year that it would be hard to top 
the success of 2010, he said in an email. To make this years

“Fiercely independent” student radio station KSDT has given up on plans to obtain an FM frequency. Station managers are now looking to build a radio tower to pursue an AM frequency instead.KSDT station co-manager Meredith Wong said that the AM tower would cost approximately $100,000 and that she hoped it could be located in a central area of campus — although she was unsure where that would be. 

“We’re really serious about it, but we haven’t started much of the research,” Wong said.

Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger presented his revised 2010-11 state budget last week, a plan that includes a new round of fund-ing increases for public colleges, but that suggests cutting $3.7 bil-

lion from health-care services that impact low-income families who depend on state welfare programs. The suggested allocations to the University of California are nearly identical to the ones from Schwarzenegger’s January propos-al, including the restoration of the $305 million cut last year and an additional $51.3 million in finan-cial aid toward the 5,121 eligible students in the system who are not currently being funded. However, the governor’s newest budget would negate his January proposal to cut $111.8 million set aside to 

accommodate growing enrollment  in the UC and CSU systems. In order to absorb California’s $19.1 billion budget deficit, other services would suffer major cuts — including a proposed $3.7 billion from in health care, that would cut the Medi-Cal program for the poor, along with state in-home support for the disabled. In addi-tion, the budget takes into account Proposition 98 — which passed in 1988 and guarantees a minimum pool of money for schools. Under

T his year’s Sun God Festival — with acts like B.o.B, Relient K, Michelle Branch and headliner Drake — attracted a packed house on May 14. For the second time in Sun God history, all 16,500 student wristbands and 3,500 guest tickets sold out.      In 2008, the first time this happened, tickets didn’t sell out until the day before. This year, all tickets sold out by 2:30 p.m. on Friday, at which time students were turned away.According to Associate Vice President of Concerts and Events Alex Bramwell — who organized this year’s Sun God Festival — the sell-out was due to the popularity of the event’s leading acts.
“We get complaints and yelled at when stu-dents can’t bring their guests, but at the same time, we get yelled at and complaints when the 

students can’t bring themselves — so finding a good balance between those two is tough,” Bramwell said. “We had the same numbers as last year. It just turned out this year to be more popular of an event; more students wanted to come.”
At the 2008 Sun God Festival — when students wristbands were distributed for the entire week leading up to the event — tickets ran out on Thursday, leading students to pur-chase all the leftover guest tickets for them-selves that Friday. 

In 2009, students waited in line for up to four hours on the morning of the festival to receive their wristbands. Despite the crowds, however, over 1,000 of last year’s wristbands went unclaimed.

way.
Coming off a tremendous postseason run 

that saw the Tritons come just short of a NCAA 
Division II National Championship last year, 
Armstrong said the team is eager for the new 
season.

“I’m excited by what I’ve seen so far this 
year,” Armstrong said. “Our passing and cre-
ativity is outstanding, and we’re not a second-
half team anymore. We’re starting and finish-
ing our games, and we’re a lot stronger on the 
ball. We have a lot of talent coming in this 

year, we have an incredibly deep bench and 
the subs coming off are always raising the 
level of play.” 

UCSD is showing no signs of fatigue: Six 
games into the new season and the No. 4 
Tritons remain undefeated. 

Kicking off their campaign with a trip up 
north, UCSD played Western Washington to 
a 0-0 draw and then beat perennial power-
houses No. 10 Seattle Pacific 2-0.

The Tritons then headed back down to 
Southern California to open conference play, 
facing off against the only two other nation-
ally ranked squads in the CCAA, No. 10 Cal 

State Los Angeles and No. 19 Cal State San 
Bernardino.

UCSD took a scrappy 1-0 win against 
CSULA on Sept. 3. 

The only goal came in the third minute 
when McTigue headed in a corner kick from 
Johnson, UCSD’s deadball specialist. 

On Sept. 9, the Tritons drew 1-1 against 
CSUSB with an unassisted goal from Callahan.

The following week, UCSD took down 
CCAA South Division newcomers San 
Francisco State 2-1 in a hard fought overtime 
win, and in the same weekend blew out Cal 
Poly Pomona 4-0.

“Right now, we’re taking each game one 
game at a time,” Armstrong said. “Our past 
success doesn’t matter this season. But I think 
if we continue to keep improving, we’ll go far.”

The Tritons’ next match is slated for Friday, 
Sept. 23 at the Home Depot Center against 
Southern California rivals CSU Dominguez 
Hills. 

UCSD will then head back home for the 
first home game of the season on Sunday, 
Sept. 25 against CSU San Bernardino.

MEN’S SOCCER PREVIEW

MICHELLE JACONETTE/GUARDIAN FILE

 The men’s soccer team will look to improve on its 3-3 overall record this week with an away game against CSU Dominguez Hills.

MEN’S SOCCER — The core of the men’s soccer team has returned 
to the pitch for the 2011-2012 campaign. 

Head coach Jon Pascale’s squad is looking to improve their 8-3-6 
overall record from last season, a campaign which proved to be as 
exhilarating as it was frustrating. 

Going without a win for their first six matches, the Tritons then 
went on an inspired eight-game undefeated streak, during which 
they drew against nationally -ranked CSU San Bernardino and upset 
No. 14 Chico State in a stunning double overtime victory.

However, the deficit the Tritons found themselves in after their 
rocky start to the season proved insurmountable, and they narrowly 
missed a post-season berth.

This season, Pascale has made a few adjustments to his starting 
eleven. Stalwart junior defender Harris Rabin is filling in the gap left 
by graduating hard-nosed fullback Jared Kukura — captain and All-
American second team selection. 

He is accompanied in the back line by sophomores Cory 
Wolfrom, Alec Arsht and Gavin Lamming. 

They sit in front of sophomore goalkeeper Josh Cohen, who saw 
limited playing time last season as a freshman, but has played every 
minute of every game so far.

Junior Alex Portela continues to control the play in the midfield 

with sophomore Andrew Keimach sitting in behind. Pacey juniors 
Kian Malek and Adam Zernik have returned to run the widths, 
while up top, the Tritons will look to sophomore Andrew Ball and 
junior Evan Walker for offense. 

So far the Tritons are 3-3 overall, splitting their only two non-
conference games, beating Cal Baptist 2-1 and then dropping a game 
0-1 to Saint Martin’s. 

UCSD opened league play on Sept. 9, losing 0-1 to CSU Los 
Angeles. In their next match, the Tritons came from behind, scor-
ing two goals within the span of three minutes to beat CSU San 
Bernardino 2-1.

The Tritons then traveled to San Francisco, taking a 1-0 win 
from SFSU. In a back-and-forth contest, UCSD broke the draw after 
Portela scored off a penalty granted in the 88th minute. Two days 
later the Tritons fell 3-0 to Cal Poly Pomona.

“At this point in the season the most important thing for our 
team is that we keep improving every day,” assistant coach Eric 
Bucchere said. “We have a diligent and motivated group, and if we 
stay focused and humble the sky is the limit.”

The Tritons will face CSU Dominguez Hills in their next match 
on Friday, Sept. 23 at the Home Depot Center. 

UCSD is scheduled to play its first home game on Sunday, Sept. 
25 against CSU San Bernardino.

MEN’S SOCCER 2011-12
2010 Record:  8-4-6 overall (8-3-5 
in CCAA)

Starting 11: Josh Cohen, Harris 
Rabin, Gavin Lamming, Cory Wul-
frum, Alec Arsht, Andrew Keimach, 
Alex Portela, Kian Malek, Adam 
Zernik, Evan Walker, Sam Ball.

Bottom Line: Already four games 
into conference play, the Tritons 
seem hampered by changes in 
personnel. They will need to work 
the kinks out quick in order to 
remain competitive for a playo 
berth.

With a 4-0-2 record, the No. 4 ranked women’s soccer team is off to their best start since 
2007, and with 10 out of their 11 starters 
back from last season, the Tritons look as 
dangerous as ever.
      All-American senior Kristin Armstrong 
has returned to tend the net for the
Tritons. 

In her third year as the keeper of 
choice for head coach Brian McManus, 
Armstrong will look to anchor the Triton 
defense. 

She is joined in the back by vet-
eran defenders, senior Sara Spaventa and 
juniors Ellen Wilson and Hayley Johnson.
    Junior midfielder Jessica Wi and senior 
midfielder Shelby Wong are continuing 
to run the widths for the Tritons, while 
junior Danielle Dixon and senior captain 
Annie Wethe — 2011 All-CCAA first 
team selection — are also continuing 
their tenures in the middle. 

They will be joined in the midfield 
by freshman midfielder Cassie Callahan.

As the only underclassman to crack 
the starting eleven, Callahan serves as the 
replacement for graduate Lisa Bradley, 
who earned All-American honors in her 
junior and senior seasons. 

Callahan — recently named CCAA 
player of the week — is making a seam-
less transition and has already notched 
three goals for the Tritons in her past 
three matches.

Junior Gabi Hernandez and senior 
captain Sarah McTigue are sitting up top 
for UCSD. 

The duo has proved lethal for the 
Tritons thus far. 5’10” junior Hernandez 
is a constant threat in the air, while 
McTigue — who was named to the All-
West Region Second Team last season — 
has already netted two goals.

Rostering 25 out of a maximum 26 
players, the depth of the squad provides 
a number of choices for McManus and 
insurance for a team that has not had 
much trouble in the way of injuries any-
