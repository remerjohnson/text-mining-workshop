Triton Taxi will 
expand to TJ 
Service will become available March 
20 despite some early complications 
By MARGARET O'NEILL 
Senior Staff Writer 

The Triton Taxi service will be 
available to pick srudents up from 
the U .S.-Mexican border in San 
Ysidro, Calif., beginning March 20. 

Legislation to fund the expan-
sion of UCSD's "safe ride home" 
program passed the A.S. Council 
unanimouslv March 6 after over six 
months of ~ork by Commissioner 
of Services and Enterprises Colin 
Parent. 

"I am really glad to see that the 
council was still behind (the expan-
sion]," Parent said . 

Up to three vans per night will 
be available to pick up srudents 
from the Jack in the Box restaurant 
near the border. The service will be 
available Wednesday. Friday and 
Sarurday nights from 11 p.m. to 3 
a.m. 

"Pickups will be from the Jack 
in the Box on San Ysidro 
Boulevard, which is well-lit, public 
and open 24 hours a day," the pro-
posal states. 

The time between when a stu-
dent calls and when he or she is 
picked up is expected to take from 
45 minutes to one hour. 

Pickup from the border will, 
like all Triton Taxi pickups, occur 
only if the student has igned a 
waiver and has a Triton Taxi stick-
er. 

Despite initial complaints by 
Vice Chancellor of Srudent Mfairs 
Joseph Watson and questions from 
the Student Safety Awareness 
Program, the Office of Services 
and Enterprises pushed the plan 

forward and negotiated with 
Cloud 9, the van service used for 
Triton Taxi , to get the program 
running. 

"1 don't think it is safe to go 
down to TJ at any time, but people 
are going to do it anyway," Parent 
said . "We, as ASUCSD, need to 
provide a safe and acces ible option 
for people to get home if their 
planned method of transportation 
fails." 

The Triton Taxi program cur-
rently sends out an average of one 
or two vans per night to pick up 
students, according to Parent. He 
said he expects the border pickups 
to be less frequent. 

"I don't think we're going to get 
more than one a weekend," Parent 
said of border pickups. "1 hope that 
not many students will need to use 
it. People should not drive to the 
border and plan to leave their cars 
there." 

SSAP Director Nancy Wahlig 
had some initial hesitations about 
running the safe-ride program to 
the border. However, she said the 
A.s. Council has thought the pro-
gram through enough that it can be 
IIseful to some srudents. 

"It seems like Triton Taxi has 
done all their homework," she said. 
"I think they've put in a safety net 
for individuals who may find them-
selves alone." 

SSAP works to educate students 
about how to stay safe when visit-
ing Mexico. 

"1 guess Triton Taxi is another 
option," Wahlig said.

Campaigns season begins 
Candidates already charged with unethical postings

By LAURA McGANN 
Staff Writer 

The Students First slate and the 
Action sbte are being accused of 
unethical campaigning for having 
student organizations reserve 
poster space for them before the 
start of official campaign time. 

According to A.S . Elections 
Manager J essica Williams, this is 
not agai nst the bylaws, but is still 
questionable. 

"It does get a little ketchy 
because of some of the o rgs that 
were used," Williams said. "For 
example, the Action slate used the 
MQ and Colin Parent is both the 
editor for the MQ and the pre i-
dential candidate on that sla te. It is 
sketchy, but there are no bylaws 
saying that they can't do that." 

Williams said election bylaws 
state that campaign posting may 
begin at the start of the ca mpaign 
period at 8 p.m. March 11 . The 
election bylaws do not, however, 
regulate student organization post-
ings. 

tudent organizations are per-
mitted to hang any poster in the 
Price Center or Srudent Center. 
Posters hung by student organiza-
tions may only be removed by the 
organization that hung them. 

Williams said complaints of ille-
gal campaigning involving the 
poster issue would not be valid. 

"Since this is the first time that 
this has reall y happened, there 
were no bylaws agai nst it, 0 no

Calli ng his lecture especially 
"timely and appropriate," Barber did 
not shy away from controversial 
n13terial even though hi s lecrure fell 
on the six-month anniversary of Sept. 
II, 

In fact, playing on President 
George W, Bush's "aris of evil" classi-
fication, Barber said, "global capital-
ism [in its current state] is an engine 
of exploitation tl1at '" establishes an 
axis of inequality, de pair and rage." 

Barber especially criticized the 
U,S, government for spreading a 
"myth of independence" while its 
compani es expl oit ci ti zens of other 
countries, 

I Ie also discussed what he calls th e 
" pervasive ignorance" of global issues 
in the Unite I States, H e referred to 
U,S, foreign policy as being the 
"Lone Ranger of tile "Vorld," which is 
as problematic as "ignoring a fire in 
the ba emcnt if you live on the fifth 
n OOL" 

Barber frequently referred to his 
hope that Sepr. I I will serve as a 
wa ke-up call to the world 's problems 
for U,S, citizens, who he hopes will

The University of Cal ifornia Marine Council has 
awarded Scripps Institution of Oceanography gradu-
ate students Bonnie Becker and Joel Fodrie with 
$10,000 each under the Coastal Environmental 
Quality Initiative to conduct research, 

As part of the CEQI, Becker and Fodne will use a 
high-tech instrument that combines a laser ablation 
unit with a magnetic sector inductive~ coupled plas-
ma mass spectrometer, which is referred to as LA-
ICP MS, The laser allows for high-resolution fine-
scale studies of manne life in oceanic research, 

Becker will use the LA-ICP MS to study inverte-
brates in the area of San Diego surrounding the 
Cabrillo national monument. The research could 
lead to improved protection for the invertebrate and 
mussel population, 

Fodrie will use the LA-ICP MS to research ear 
bones of fish and to identify the main nursery areas 
of halibut off of the California coast. Fodne's research 
could lead to the creation of future marine reserves 
in California. 

Med school researchers say 
that aging is old hat 

Researchers from the UCSD School of Medicine 
are trying to find out if health problems associated 
with old age can be reversed with the restoration of 
the hormone DHEA as part of the DHEA and 
Well ness Study by the Department of Family and 
Preventative Medicine, 

DHEA may be related to numerous functions 
such as muscle strength, bone density, the immune 
system, cardiovascular disease, mood and sexual 
function, The research seeks to discover if there is in 
fact a connection, 

Nonsmoking men between the ages of 70 and 
84, and women between 55 nnd 84 will be subjects 
of the study, 

Researchers are seeking 100 men and 100 
women to participate in the trial. Subjects will be 

~iven DHEA or a placebo each day for a year, All par-
ticipants will receive free medical evaluations, while 
female participants will get mammograms and 
males will be tested for Prostate-speCIfic antigen

UC5D student under police 
investigation for WeI) site 

A UCSD student has recently become the subject 
of a San Diego Police Department investigation into 
the possibility that the student's Web site contains 
child pomography, 

Bertrand Fan, a 21-year-old junior, hosts a Web 
site from his San Diego home that contains pictures 
of hundreds of high-school-age girls and asks users 
to rate the females on a ,scale of one to 10, based 
on whether they think the females are 'jailbait.' 

Controversy erupted when administrators at a 
high school in Castro Valley, Calif., began receiving 
phone calls from parents of gins posted on the site. 
The callers expressed concern over the photos on 
Fan's site, according to Castro Valley High School 
Associate Principal Jim Maxwell. 

A Castro Valley HiRh School student has recently 
come forward and aamitted to taking some of the 
photos that appear on Fan's Web site, Maxwell said, 

According to The Daily Review, a Bay Area news-
paper, Fan uploaded the images to his Web site 
from Pbase,com, a file-sharing Web site that allows 
users to set up folders and share thei r photos on 
the Web.

New study shows that many 
college students are in debt 
CalPIRG research shows that the cost of college is rising 
beyond that of regular inflation, hurting some students 
By EVAN McLAUGHLIN 
Associate News Editor 

Four out of 10 U .S, coll ege 
graduates face unmanagea ble lev-
els of smdent loan debt, according 
to a report re leased b y the 
Ca liforn ia Public Interest 
Research Group last week. T he 
report, titl ed "The Burden of 
Borrowing," exa mines the diffi -
cu lty srudents have in payi ng off 
debt after gradua tion, 

Research for the report came 
from the H igher Education 
Project, which is a branch of the 
Sta te Public Interes t Research 
Group lobby group, T he report 
intended to demonstrate w at a 
student's chances of payin g off 
debts incurred while in coll ege 
have become slimmer in the last 
decade, 

N ationally, student debt has 
nea rly doubled si nce 1992, when 
the average student owed $9,188, 
as opposed to $16,928 in 2000, 
with inflation not taken into 
account, AJ'te r infl ation, according 
to the infl ation calculator at 
h tIP :llwww.wcstegg.coml infla t iO'I, 
debt increased by 22 percent, 

T h e report stated that 65 per-
cent o f students now rely on 
some sort of loan to pay fo r col-
lege, as opposed to 42 percent in 
1992. 

T he report, based on figures 
obtained from the U.S. C ensus 
Bureau and the Dcparonent of 

Education's NationaI Center for 
Education Statistics, cites some 
possible factors in the increase in 
student debt. 

The study suggests that tuition 
hikes have acce lerated debt accu-
mulation by U ,S, coll ege stu-
dents, According to the report, 
which took inflation into account, 
medi an income in the United 
States has increased by 12 percent 
over the las t decade - tui tion for 
four-year public universities has 
increased 40 percent in the same 
time. However, if inflation is 
taken into account, ruition costS 
only 15 percent more than it did 
in 1992 , 

Because of w e rise in tuition, 
financia l ai d is becoming a less sig-
ni ficant financial force fo r stu-
dentS , Pell GrantS have lost buying 
power over the last 25 years. A sru-
dent could re ly on a Pell G rant to 
cover 84 percent of tuition costS at 
a four-year public instirution in 
1976, as opposed to only 37 per-
cent today, 

"Ten years ago, there were 
more grants given out than loans," 
said Merriah Fairchild, CalPIRG's 
higher education advocate and a 
former student who depended on 
financial aid to pay for tuition. 
"Since then it has switched, and 
we lack of grants has really hurt 
students trying to make ends 
meet." 

The report is part of State 
PIRG efforts to raise awareness 

that a greate r cross-section of 
the popula tio n is pursuing a 
higher education , wh ile fewer 
and fewe r students can affo rd to 
do it, 

"This report was conducted to 
help Congress and our state legis-
larures understand the basic rea li -
ties for srudentS to pay for school," 
Fairchild said, 

Fairchild contends that people 
in the U nited States recognize 
the importance of a coll ege 
degree but may not realize w e 
finan cial consequences o f a high-
er educati on until they are well -
indebted, 

"A college degree is worw 75 
percent more than a high school 
diploma, or over $ 1 mill ion ,in a 
life time," Fairchild said. "However, 
college CoStS continue to swell into 
increasingly shouldering high lev-
els of debt, Al l tOO often this debt 
becomes a ba ll and chain for sru-
dentS after graduation." 

According to the loan industry, 
srudent loan payments are consid-
ered unmanageable if they com-
prise over 8 percent of o ne's 
monthly income. The overall ra te 
of college graduates wiw un man-
ageable debt is 39 percent, The 
proportion of African-Americans 
and Hispani c students with 
unmanageable debt is even more 
severe, at 55 percent and 58 per-
cent, respectively.

Fee increase 
needs support 

:\ ext ljuarter, UCSD undergraduates will 
\'ore on :J I)roposed $28.25 increase to quar-
terlY um ergraduate fees for athletics. 
CCSD's Intel~co llegi a te sports and club teams 
h~lI'e been surviving on temporary funds since 
the move to Division II two years ago, and 
those funds wIll be gone next year. 

The Gurmlirlll strongly urges students to 
vote tor this fee increase. If the referendwn 
does not pass, UCSD 's intercollegiate athlet-
ics budget wi ll essentially be halved, gutting 
Its programs. 

\\ 'e 3t the Guardian, however, must 
denounce the folly of the referendum's orga-
IlIzers, the A .. Task Force on Intercollegiate 
:\ thletic Funding Issues, . 

The AS task force excluded the Graduate 
~rudent Association from the committee that 
drafted the athletics referendtml. Only at the 
Lm minute was the organization allowed one 
nonvoting member on the committee. It was 
irresponsIble and unwise to exclude the offi-
cial mice of 3,500 UCSD students. 

As a result of its exclusion, the GSA has 
opted not to participate in the referendwn. 
GraduJte students won't vote in it, and they 
won't pay tor it if it passes. -

The only way to receive diverse support 
for hi gher fet:s is to include diver e groups 
in the planning process . The Guardian 
hopes that poor organization will not cause 

th i ~ desperatelv needed fee increase to be 
defeated. . 

Watson's e-mail 
overstepped 
bounds 

\ Ice Chancellor of Student Affai rs Joseph 
\,\farson e-mailed all UCSD staff and stu-
dents March 8 with a response to the latest 
issue of The K{)rda. In the e-mail , Watson 
expresses shame and disheartenment at the 
publication'S portrayal of kidnapping and 
murder victim Danielle van Dam, a 77year-
old Sabre Springs, Calif. resident. 

The Guardian finds Watson's response an 
appropriate, necessary and decorous reac-
tion to the humor paper's treatment of 
Danielle van Dam. 

However, the Guardian also finds two 
aspects of Watson 's e-mail inappropriate. 
First, Watson's assertion that his condemna-
tion of the publication was being made "on 
behalf of the UCSD community" is unfair. 
Just as the humor paper may not represent 
the UCSD community's voice, neither may 
Watson. He was not correct to assume that 
his opinion was one that represented the 
campus community. 

Second, Watson's condemnation of the 
humor paper's supposed "abuse" of free 
speech is inappropriate. Free speech is either 
supported on campus or it isn't - certain 
expressions of free speech cannot fairly be 
cl)ndemned from above while other expres-
sions of free speech are upheld. Simply put, 
Watson's role is not to serve as judge over 
what constitutes an "abu e" of free speech at 
UCSD.

OPINION 

THEY'RE CAlLING HIM! 

A nation torn: India's religious 
war claims hundreds of lives 

Countty IT1USt quickly alleviate tensions between 
Hindus and Muslims before crisis spirals out of control 
By VISHAL PATEL 
Senior Staff Writer 

A crisis is occurring in India. A reli-
gious war that began decades ago has 
been rekindled. What once was believed 
to be a quelled situation between 
Muslims and Hindus in India has 
become one of the worst religious wars 
the counuy has seen. 

Hindu zealots are stoning and 
destroying Muslim shops and homes in 
Ahmedabad and other cities in the 
Indian state of Gujarat. The fighti ng has 
become so grave that troops have been 
called from the Pakistani fTont to set tip 
order within these cities. The nation's 
top foreign priority, its ongoing confl ict 
with Pakistan, is a lower priority now 
while India attempts to cope with its 
domestic difficulties. 

The si tuation is bringing back memo-
ries of the pain and anguish of the 
slaughter of religious zealots occurring 
between Hindus and Muslims 55 years 
ago. 

The present strife erupted from the 
controversy surrounding the religious 
value of the city of Ayodhya, the site of a 
Muslim mosque that was destroyed by a 
frenzied crowd in 1992. The city has 
religious importance for both Muslims 
and Hindus who revere the city as most 
holy; Ayodhya is claimed as the birth-
place of Ram, arguably the most impor-
tant Hindu god. 

Ayodhya has consistently been in tur-
moil. After the demolition of the mosque 
10 yea rs ago, fi erce riots ensued, killing 
2,000 Hindus and Muslims. After much 
negotiation by Indian Primc Minister 
Atal Behari Vajpayee, the turmoil 
appeared to subside. 

Recently, however, the Vishwa Hindu 
Parishad , or World Hindu Council, 
advanced plans to build a temple to Ram 
at the site of the demolished mosque. 
These talks further spurred violence that 
led to the slaughter of 58 Hindus twO 
weeks ago. A train carrying a group of 
Hindus from a prayer meeting of the 
VHP at Ayodhya was ambushed by 

fanatic Muslims and burned. Fifty-eight 
Ilindus, including women and children, 
were killed in this incident. 

A string of riots ensued in Gujant, 
with Hindus taking arms against 
Muslims throughout the state. 
Ahmedabad, the city hardest hit, has 
been put on partial curfew under a con-
stant military presence. The economy 
has shut down because businesses have 
closed their doors. The incidents remind 
India of its unhealed strife between 
Hindus and Muslims. 

Since Vajpayee has been at the helm 
of the Indian government, he has wrong-
ly tried to sideline the Ayodhya issue 
using bureaucracy and procrastination. 
Vajpayee has had to deal with many 
other issues, including a struggling econ-
omy, a schism of his poli tical party, the 
Bharatiya Janata Party, and ongoing 
Pakistani securi ty issues. With the erup-
tion of recent violence, Vajpayee has 
been unable to address India\; border 
disputes with Pakistan, which could 
polarize India and doom it, 

What is most disrurbing is that the 
consequences of the Ayodhya issue could 
be the most disastrous. In a counuy 
comprised of a mix of Muslims and 
Hindus (but run mosdy by Hindus), 
there has been a strong push to complete 
the temple for Ram at Ayodhya. 
Vajpayee has tried to bwy the temple in 
paperwork to quell the Muslims. He 
appealed to the VHP to halt construc-
tion to appease Muslim sentiment. In 
mistakenly doing so, however, many 
Hindu nationalist-controlled state and 
parliament seats have begun to secede 
from Vajpayee's party, weakening the 
currently united India. 

L.K. Advani, the home affairs minis-
ter and an influential Hindu nationalist, 
reminded Vajpayee tha this coali tion 
came to power with a pledge to rebuild 
the temple and that Vajpayee relies 
largely on Hindu support. The longer 
that Vajpayee waits to make a decision on 
the temple, the hotter the blood of 
Muslim and Hindu zealots boils as they 
feel deceived, and the more they will uy 

to take matters into their own hands. 
Vajpayee has shown that he can often 

be a brilliant statesman and has led IndIa 
out of nUllultuous times. He has begun 
to bolster the Indian economy and even 
resolved parts of an inc rea ingly tense 
issue with Pakistan that almost led to 
huclear war. However, his indecisiveness 
as to how to deal with Ayodhya has 
already begun not only to increa e vio-
lence among supporters of the temple, 
but has caused Vajpayee to lose power in 
the northern states of Indi a. 

Vajpayee must act on the issue of the 
Ayodhya templ e immediately, making it 
the foremost concern on his political 
agenda. Only after solving this issue is 
India safe within its own borders. Then 
Vajpayee can deal with global concerns. 

India is poised to become a world 
power and player in a time of globaliza-
tion. The correct balance of internal 
structure with foreign policy can lead 
India to a respectable position in the 
world . The United States has shown 
that the security of the home front can 
be breached, but it must immediately 
be restored for the protection of its cit-
izens. 

Vajpayee must forget about satisfy-
ing the various zealot groups that fight 
over an issue that may never be solved. 
He must instead enforce his authority 
as the leader of India and ensure the 
safety of his people. He must do what-
ever is required to alleviate the prob-
lem. The use of the former mosque site 
in Ayodhya should be restricted; it 
should be blocked from religious use, 
period. 

India. may not know who has the right 
to Ayodhya, but Vajpayee should not 
falsely yanlc both sides around trying to 
appease the other, In a religious debate, 
the past has shown that neither side will 
compromise any beliefs, and thus 
Vajpayee must act like a stern father 
chiding both of his children. If Vajpayee 
does nOt quell both sides, the future of 
India will cycle as the past has already 
done, with a brutality that rivals the vio-
lence occurring in the Middle East. , 

5 OPINION THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Fainting spells for Southern belle 

basically 
CARRI[ I:LlZ.A.BETH SKL .. \R 

Being from the Southern part of 
the United States 
means three things: 
You have a tendency to 
slur entire sentences 
into one word (exam-
ple: "Howyl alldoin'?//); 
you are destined to 
marry your cousin or 
uncle (though they 
may be the same per-
son); and you have 
fainting spells, 

Luckity, I'm Southern. 
I should note that it is also 

lucky that living in California has 
taught me to separate individual 
words while speaking (with the 
occasional "y'all" slipping in here 
and there). Furthermore, my 
uncle and cousin have both been 
removed to the East Coast to pre-
vent any unwanted incestuous 
progeny, though this does not 
guarantee that the two of them 
aren't getting it on. 

But, in true Southern belle 
style, I do faint. And to make up 
for the fact that I will never fulfill 
my destiny as the mother of my 
own nephew, I faint a lot. 

Most of the timc, people arc 
freaked out by this little quirk, 
though I maintain that in North 
Carol ina I would probably receive 

accolades for my passing ou t 
prowess. But every once in a while 
I manage to make someone's day 
with my "spells." Like when I 
faint in the shower. 

Over the summer I was staying 
in one of the most decrepit donn 
arrangements in the world. You had 
to climb stairs to get to the bath-
room, duck to avoid getting a con-
cussion when going into the 
kitchen and you didn 't get any rent 
deduction for sharing a bedroom 
with Mr. Grossbug, the largest 
insect ever born. 

More importantly, the shower 
was right next to Matt's room, so 
you couldn't sing while you washed. 
[ guess co-ed housing was supposed 
to make up for the musica l stigma. 

Within the first two weeks of 
my stay, I had already fainted while 
negotiating the stairs to get out of 
the bathroom and into the kitchen. 

Matt acted like a typical man 
and ran around panicking while I 
picked mysel f off the floor. 
(Unfortunately, Mr. Grossbug was 
not under me when I fell, and 
managed to survive the summer.) 

But [ digress. Matt was panick-
ing. 

Matt (shrieking like a girl): 
"What happened? What did you 
do)" 

Me (completely sympathetic to 
Matt's oblivion): "J was building a 
model airplane, you dumbass." 

Matt (looking around for a 
model airplane kit): "Hungh)" 
(Now the gears are turning. Matt 
is no idiot. He can clearly see that 
[ don't like working with glue .... ) 
"No, you weren't. Youfaillltd." 

Me (grateful for that clarifica-
tion): "I did? Wow, thanks, Matt. " 

Matt (entranced with myabili-
ty to hit the fl oor and get back up 
again): "Do you do that a lot?" 

Me (rubbing my elbow, which 
I had landed on): "Yeah, so if you 
hear a thud while I'm in the show-
er, you'll have to rescue me." 

Famous last words. 
About a month later, I was 

casually showering and not 
singing, when I started to feel 
dizzy. I thought at first it was just 
the shock of actually having hot 
water for an extended period of 
time for once, but then I started 
getting nauseated as well. 

Experienced fainters will know 
that there are three key signs that 
you are about to faint: dizziness, 
nausea and being told that you have 
won the lo ttery. 

I had two out of three. 
Thus knowing that I was about 

to kill myself Vf7J inelegantly in 
the shower, I turned off the water 
and tried to sit down before losing 
consciousness. I didn't quite make 
it. But I guess 115 pounds of pure 
Southern delicacy m akes a pretty 
loud bang when it hi ts a tile floor. 
In other words: I woke Matt's ass 
up when I fainted. 

Of course, since I am a very 
humorous and witty person, Matt 
thought I was playing a joke on 
him. But since Matt is a verychival-
rous and caring guy, he decided that 
he had better make sure. 

So Matt did what any guy would 
do. He broke down the door. 

And found me naked . 
Of cou rse, the fact that fainting 

only actually lasts a few seconds, 
plus the incredibly loud bang Matt 
was able to make by busting 
through a locked door, brought 
me back to consciousne s. I woke 
up to see Matt staring at me. Now, 
if I had been bleeding profusely 
from the head, I firmly believe that

Sex, scandal all in a 
day's work at Cal 
Student-led class causes uproar 
By WILSON CHEN 
Staff Writer 

How many of you, if polled, 
would want to engage in a class 
involving no professors and lots of 
hot sex? 

Reality) Not at UCSD, but at 
UC Berkeley, a school known in 
times past for its outrageous liber-
alism and overt sexuali ty, th e exis-
tence of Stich a cla&. i no stunner. 
You ca n expect classes such as this 
when students are allowed to run a 
class largely on their own. 

The Daily Califomiall and local 
media blew up a story concerning 
such a class to the degree of scan-
dal , but it does provide a juicy 
forum for students. I am quite sure 
sex is always a captivating subject. 
It makes me sit on the edge of my 
seat laughing just to think of boys 
and girls giggling at each other's 
genitalia. 

The class being targeted at Cal, 
women's studies 98/198, is the only 
one in the women's studies pro-
gra m that is student-run. There are 
two versions - one on male sexu-
ality and one on female sexuality. 

These students should appear 
on "The Howard Stern Show," 
beca lise in the middle of a class 
party, participants were allegedly 
asked (if they were comfortable 
with it) to do a picture exchange of 
their private parts and later match 
them up with their respective own-
ers. 

H ow comfortable would most 
stud ents be in a class where 
extracurriclllar activi ties allegedly 

include orgies and witnessing an 
instructor have sex at a club such as 
Sex Exchange in San Francisco? I 
find it hard to imagine most m-
dents being able to handle that 
without finding it awkward . 

This is a unique flavur of the 
De-Cal program, or Democratic 
Education at Cal. De-Cal courSe, 
have been part of UC Berkeley for 
quite some time now. Author John 
Leo remarked that "a lot of educa-
tional theory says that teacher-led 
classes are too hierarchical." The\' 
imply th at teachers know more 
than students do. I n De-Cal , 
instructors are coordinators und 
faci litators, so everyone is on the 
same level. Students themselves 
have said tllat De-Ca l classes fill 
"that empty space where faculty 
can't go." 

I encourage the idea of De-Cal 
classes. They provide a forum for 
discussion and thinking that most 
lectures and other universi ty cours-
es cannot. Students can freely offer 
or share their feelings without the 
constraints of the usual classroom 
setting. De-Cal courses also allow 
more interaction among snldents, 
so closer ties with people are 
formed. All these benefits are good 
for a healthy student life. 

A problem I see wi th the sexual-
ity cour es at UC Berkeley is prob-
ably the main question of thosc 
who oppose the class curriculum 
and material of women's studies 
981198. Writing abou t your sexual 
fantasies, groping your classmates,

Course: 
Issue was blown out of 
proportion 
Continued from page 5 
sucking on their nipples and srrip-
ping - do those activities count as 
serious academic study? There is a 
big debate about this, because stu-
dents receive credit toward gradua-
tion for De-Cal courses. 

Pornography and other areas of 
sexual studies among institutions of 
higher learning are becoming more 
widespread, as Leo generously 
points out. A lot of universities and 
professors see pornography as a 
study of American society and pop 
culture, signifying that it is OK to 
view and study porn. The sexuality 
class at Cal featured porn star Nina 
Hartley, local sex shop owners and 
other connoisseurs of sex as guest 
speakers. In context, if students are 
learning about their bodies and 
modern pop culture and have fun 
doing so, there is hardly any nega-
tivity surrounding the issue. 

If the issue is about control , the 
students should win hands-down, 
since this is student-run, democra-
tic education. 

The issue has extended now to 
morals, ethics and values. This is 
si lly because one of the main con-
cepts taught in this linle course at 
Berkeley is to be nonjudgmental. 
The class teaches students specifi-
cally not to decree what is right or 
wrong, no maner what they think, 
because judging others creates con-
rroversies we can avoid by being 
more loving and accepting. 

We should focus on topics such 
as how the womens sexuality section 
discusses the empowerment of 
women instead of "hardcore" ele-
ments, as a student in the class, 
Morgan Janssen, so boldly declared. 

If indeed the "unacceptable" 
behavior of the students is 
extracurricular and the classes do 
promote academic learning, the 
conflict is one of what is right and 
wrong. De-Cal was born to erase 
t11at type of prejudice. What peo-
ple do at parties and in their own 
free time is frankly none of anyone 
else's business. 

Column: 
Lesson of the day: Do 
not faint while naked 
Continued from page 5 

Matt would still have just stood there 
and stared at me. Not to imply that 
tile sight of me naked is all th at awe-
inspiring, but Man (as I think r have 
mentioned) is a man. And when 
bced with a naked woman, it is the 
duty of all men to stand and stare 
stupidly at them (mostly thei r 
breasts). So when you think abom it, 
Matt was doing his gender proud. 

For my pan (and r suspect the 
part of all womankind),l wanted him 
to get the hell out of the bathroom. 

Me (very naked): "Matt, [ am 
naked." 

Matt (standing over m e) : "Um," 
(pause) "you binted." (Pause) "Are 
you OK? Do you need help?" 

Me (sti ll naked, but dignified, 
dammit): "No. Thanks anyway." 

Matt (kindly making absolutely 
sure my breasts were not harmed in 
my fall) : "Um. Are you sure you 
don't need help?" 

Me (did I mention t11at I am 
nude here'): "Yes. Very su re.". 

Matt (still standing there, clear-
ly losi ng his grasp of the English 
language): "OK.~ 

Of course, I ca n't get up and get 
a towel until Matt leaves. And of 
course, Matt is not leaving. So I did 
what any woman would do. 

Me (and you would have said the 
same thing): "Matt I 11m naked IlIId 
you 1lud to get tbe htlillUt of h"el " 

So I finally got my white knight 
to leave me the hell alone. But that 
batllroom door never completely 
shut again. So b . .sically, if yo e 
gonna faint, you might as well be 
naked. At least then people will 
really want to hel p you.

Tracey King, an author of the

th.e rising costs of those institu-

are not always capable of subsidiz-
ing the costs, especially in rough 
economic times. 

King stressed that while Burden 
advocates a stronger supplemental 
force for higher education, chances 
of increasing federal and state fund-
ing for student financial aid are 
going to have to wait out the current 
economic slump. 

The Affordable Student Loan Act 
is being proposed in the U.S. House 
of Representatives. The act would 
save about $700 per student by effec-
tively eliminating origination and 
insurance fees on student loans. King 
said that the depleted economic con-
ditions of national and state budgets 
will decrease the priority of the bill.

THURSDAY, MARCH 14,2002 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Through the decades: a journey through pop culture from the 19505 into the future 
'50s 

I 's amazing how history repeats itself. With the advent of the new Bush administration, the recession and the 
"war against terrorism" in the 

Middle East, the start of the millennium 
has been almost too similar to a period 
two decades ago: the 1 980s. 

Yes, we are now practically reliving it. 
JUSt look around at all the resurfacing 
'80s clubs, radio stations and even televi-
sion shows such as "That 80's Show." 

Despite the economic and political 
turmoil of the '80s, the decade produced 
some quality, diverse and crea tive enter-
tainment that has yet to be matched. In 
the musical arena, brilliant and enduring 
artists emerged such as Nhldonna, U2, 
Sting, Bon Jovi and Journey. 

1n fact, it is probably the events of the 
decade, such as the eight-year Iran-Iraq 
War, the end of the Cold War and the dis-
covery of (\lDS, that caused a nced for 
diversion. This social turmoil was coupled 
with the dawn of a new technological era. 

MTV 
"The '80s brought in a tremendous 

emphasis on surface appearances," said 
UCSD ethnic studies professor George 
Lipsitz. "They used to talk about movies 
in the '80s as bei ng built around the look, 
the hook and the book. And what they 
mean by that is a real emphasis on visual 
imagery call ing attention to itself." 

So it's no surprise that Music Television 
was created in 1981 , linking music and 
image like never before. Single-handedly 
changing the face of the music industry, 
MTV provided a new visual medium for 
musical consumption and marketing. 

For the bands, singers and musicians. 
it was either a blessing or a curse. 

"tn orderto promote youralbum. -you 
need to have videos. MTV is really more 
of a commercial disguised as an enter-
tainment program," said UCSD sociolo-
gy professor Ryan Moore. 

Many musical artists took advantage 
of it; an obvious example is Michael 
Jackson, whose elaborate videos cost mil-
lions to produce. MTV became so 
important that the commercial success of 
a band depended - and still continues to 
depend - almost entirely upon videos as 
opposed to the musical quality of the 
songs. 

Artists who choose not to use music 

'60s '70s 

videos may suffer in record sales and pop-
ularity, but they may go on to prove that 
good music does not lie in the hands of 
Carson Daly. 

Hip-hop and RIB 
Some of the biggest musical forces 

that came out of the '80s included hip-
hop and R&B - genres that continue to 
enjoy national success. 

R&B introduced immortal arists such 
as Michael Jackson and Prince. 

"Michael Jackson basically broke the 
color barrier on MTv. Before him, MTV 
would not play videos by black artists," 
Moore commented. 

Hip-hop and rap evolved in the ghettos 
of soudlern Bronx in ew York and start-
ed to gain more acceptance \vith groups 
such as RlUl-DMC. Their videos were the 
first rap videos to be played on MTV and 
their albums were the first in dle hip-hop 
genre to go multipbtinum with the 1986 
release of "Raising Hell." Public Enemy 
came blazing into dlC late 
'80s widl their raw and bit· 
ing blend of politically pow-
ered rap and became one of 
the most controversial and 
influential groups ever. 

"Hip-hop makes an art 
form out of ta lking back," 
Lipsitz said. "At a time when 
the general culmre of the soci-
ety was celebrating wealth and 
how great things were, hip-hop 
was talking directly about what's 
happening in the inner cities: 
unemployment, police brutality, 
racism - things that at that time 
weten't being talked about at all 
in the mainstream media. Chuck 
D of Public Enemy used to say 
that hip-hop is black people's 
CNN. It's an alternative network 
that tells the news. ' 

Hip-hop was meant to be an 
alternative to the mainstream media and 
it is ironic to see it become so much a part 
of the mainstream in later decades. 

New Wave 
The "new wave" genre of music 

exploded in the '80s. 
Artists such as. Blondie and the Talking 

Heads were among the first to popularize 
it. New Wave actually has its roots in the 
huge British punk scene that developed in 
the late '70s from bands such as the Sex 
Pistols and The Clash. 

"Record 
companies can 't market punk rock 

to a mass audience," Moore explained. 
"So new wave comes about because they 
are trying to sell bands that are kind of 
influenced by punk and kind of alterna-
tive but not the kind of guitar-driven, 
violent, hardcore type of bands. Billy 
Idol is a perfect example." 

Mainstream new wave tended to be 
fairly upbeat and melodic with dancey 
hooks, and was often characterized by the 
use of synthesizers. Probably the most vis-
ible popular new wave band was Duran 
Duran, the essential "boy band" of the '80s 
with their charming good looks and songs 
like "Rio" and "Hungry Like a Wolf." 

New Order successfully linked new 
wave with dance music through 

such classics as "Blue Monday." 
There was also a more melan-
choly, lyrical and darker side of 
new wave exemplified by 
Depeche Mode and The Cure, 

who were very distinct

exceptionally creative bands thaI have 
lasted through the years and arc still 
going. strong with successful tours and 
albwns. 

Heavy Metal 
There's no avoiding the impact of 

heavy metal Mether you love it or hate 
it. heavy metal made a real impression in 
the '80s with such wildly popular bands as 
ModeyCrue. DefLeppard, Poison, Guns 
'N' R05CS, ACIDC and Van Balen. 

Many of us now probably dismiss the 
'80s hair bands as a screaming epitome of 
excess and androgynous fashion trends, 
but at the time, they had a lot of dedicat-
ed fans who were passionate about the 
music. And few can say that bands SUC!l as 
Van Halen didn't produce some powerful 
music. For those who are skeptical of 
glam metal's melodic powers, look no 
further than Def Leppard's powerfu l 
an thems "Love Bites" and "lIys teria." 

Hair bands were probably the most 
visible, but Moore explained that "in the 
'80s, the American scene kind of splinters 
off in two directions: glam metal , and 
then you have the whole underground 
like Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth and 
Anthrax." 

This obscure and darker untlerground 
metal scene made a deeper impact on its 
fa n base. 

"There's a difference between th e 
music that did really well commercially 
and the music that young people were 
really passionate about and really identi-
fied with," Moore said. "People aren't just 
buying records, (they] are creating a

Rob Zombie lurches his way 
back to SDSU's Cox Arena 
Horror movies and rock stars wearing sh iny 
leather pants bring the noise th is Friday 
By RINALDO DORMAN 
Associate Hiatus Editor 

Rob Zombie will bring his B-horror-movie-inspired stage show to San Diego State's Cox 
Arena this Friday. Zombie is 
known for his expensive and lavish-
ly produced tours, and his theatrics 
have been praised as a return to the 
golden age of arena rock that 
Zombie's influence, Alice Cooper, 
reigned. With his hectic schedule 
- he just finished making a horror 
movie - it's a little surprising that 
Zombie found time to write a new 
aJbum and plan another tour. 

Zombie's spin with Ko rn in 
1999's "Rock Is Dead" tour fea-
tured extensive pyrotechnics, 
scanti ly clad go-go dancers and a 
15 -foot robot that chased Zombie 
around stage. T hat tour brought 
him to a welcomi ng Cox Arena 
audience . His en ergetic perfor-
ma nce and music took the crowd to 
the heights of enjoyment. 

This year's opening act, 
Sin isstar, is coming along for their 
fi rst tri p to San Diego; they missed 
an opportunity to come with the 
Anger Management tour last year. 
They are an unexpectedly focused 
band. With all their attention cen-
tered on their music, they break 
away from the rock 'n' roll ethos of 
sex, drugs and rock 'n ' roll . 

"We don't drink or do any 
drugs," said singer Edgy during a 
phone interview. "We're complete-
ly focused on the music. It's JUSt 
really bad seeing someone drunk or 

f---ed up and not able to perform." 
It is commendable and surpris-

ing that a band in the presence of 
extensive musica l hedonism 
remains straight-laced , but their 
philosophy is especially ironic in 
light of Sinisstar's leather-clad, Hot 
Topic, heroin sheik appearance. 

In every press photo I've man-
aged to get my grubby hands on, 
Sinisstar look like four disci pl es of 
Trent Remor or Marilyn Manson, 
Rather than going all the way with 
this over-the-top look, they tend to 
keep the stage show a little more 
grounded. For full distance from 
Zombie's massively budgeted pro-
duction , on-stage Sinisstar have 
only their music and a banner with 
their name on it. 

"It's just us and the musIc up 
there," Edgy commented, "We just 
don't have the budget for anything 
else." 

Fans of Zombie 's current radio 
hits - or even JUSt live performance 
buffs - will find something to 
please them with the Undead One's 
return to San Diego, Nothing less 
then a mind-blowing and hair-spl it-
ting performance is expected of 
Zombie and the upstart, almost 
homeless youngsters of Siniss tar. 
The combination should make for a 
night of music, merriment and real-
ly loud guitars. 

Rob Zombie and Sinisstar will be at 
the Cox Arena at 7 p.m. Look to the 
hiatus calendar on this page for more 
information.

Cuddly, warm 'Ice Age' takes the chills 
away from the prehistoric past 
Predictability aside, the animation film makes for . 
worthy family fare with funny characters, cool plotllne 

Film By MAn HUEY Contri buting Staff Writer 
REVIEW "I ce Age" is one of tl1?Se frosty treats of animated film fluff: sweet, slightly 

sugarcoa ted, and lightweight, but 
likeable. This cold-climate tale has a decid-
edly warm, modern twist in its revisiting of 
that prehistoric frozen era, 

The movie dishes up an offering of cute and 
cuddly critters: Theres the stoic but sympa-
thetic Manfred the Marrunoth (voiced by Ray 
Romano), the wisecracking sidekick Sid the 
Sloth aohn Leguizamo) and the icy outsider 
Diego the Sabertoothed Tiger (Denis Leary). 

running gag throughout the fi lm is a squir-
rel-rat hybrid engaged in a series of thwarted 
attempts to store an acorn for the fast-
approaching winter. 

The plot revolves around this oddball 
crew's efforts to reunite a human infant with 
his fami ly. T hese characters initially battle, 
but eventually bond with one another ·while 
braving an impending ice age. 

The angular artwork relies largely upon 
computer-generated graphics, with the e~d 
creation looking like a cross between conuc 
book sketches and c1aymation cartoons. The 
computer-in fl uenced animation may draw 
comparisons to the techniques seen in such box 
office successes as "Shrek" and "Monsters, 
Inc." wi th the use of distinct color schemes and 
sketches that favor action over aunosphere. 

The film also draws upon a welcome 
brand of prehistoric pop culture ("all the sen-
sitive ones have been eaten," laments a fema le 

Call it revisionist history. 
Along the way, they encounter a pair of 

disgruntled rh inos, as well as the self-pro-
claimed "Tae Kwon Do Dodos." Another

Gorillal 
G-Sides 

Virgin Records 

**** The Go rill az. released 
their se lf-titled debut last 
August and exploded onto 
the music scene with the 
catchy vocals of songs such 
as "Clint Eastwood" and 
the bouncy melodies in 
" 19-2000." 

Part of the ma!,';c behind 
the Gorillaz was the fact 
that they were all cartoon 
characters who - strangely 

- sound like Damon 
A1barn of Blur and produc-
er Dan the Automator. 

The magic is back with 
a release of the "G-Sides," 
which offers clever 
reworkings of the original 
songs. These remixes are 
relatively simple and really 
don't offer anything new. 
But then again, the fresh 
and unique sounds of the 
Gorillaz really don't need 
to be revitalized with sli ck 
remixes. 

The Soul Child remix 
of " 19-2000" is a bright 
twist of the origi nal. 
\,veighing in at three min -
utes and 30 secollds, it is 
the perfect pop length , 
The Wiseguys House of 
Wisdom remix of "19-
2000" has a fun],:y house 
sou nd and is great for the 
dance floor. The song 
itself is stripped down and 
leaves only the bare essen-
tials of the original ver-
sion. 

See ICE, Page 12 

• review 
"Clint Eastwood" is 

also stri pped down in the 
Phi Life Cypher mix. The 
original melody and beat 
are present, but the sunny 
vocals from A1barn are 
replaced by an awesome 
I yri cal fI ow, 

The sounds of the pseu-
do-spi ri tua I-soul-el ectro 
song "Ghost Train" move 
along with a beat that is 
reminiscent of, well, a 
train . The concept of the 
song is brilliant, The tech-
no-soul tune starts slowly, 
but then steams up ro a 
fran tic pace with thick, 
ptmkish guitars. 

"G-Sides" retains that 
odd sound and rhythm 
from tl1e original Gorillaz 
album, but the remixes and 
production arc minimal is -
tic. That straightforward 
approach makes for a grea t 
compani on to their self-
titled release,

Fi lms 
On top of all the great music. 

who could forget all the brilliant 
fi lms mat came out of the ·80s. reviv-
ing and revamping cinema forever? 

Advances in technology during 
the decade led to the innovative use 
o f special effects mat produced 
such landmark films as "E.T. ... 
"Terminator." "Aliens" and "Back 
to the Funlre." Although the movie 
phenomenon known as "Sta r 
Wars" began in 1977 with the first 
installment of the original trilogy. it 
is most commonly associated with 
the early '80s wim the release of 
"The Empire Strikes Back" in 1980 
and "Return of me Jedi" in 1983 . 

The decade is also fondly 
remembered for bringing the teen 
audience such entertaining coming-
of-age movies as "SI. Elmo's Fire." 
"The Breakfast Club." (whose stars 
were collectively known as me 
"Brat Pack") "Pretty in Pink." 
"Sixteen Candles," "Ferris Bueller's 
Day Off' and "Fast Times at 
Ridgemont High." 

Of course. the '80s would not 
have been complete without Tom 
Cruise dancing and playing air gui-
tar in his underpants to Bob Seger 
in "Risky Business." propelling his 
career skyward and later to super-
stardom with such movies as "Top 
Gun" and "Rain Man." 

T here were also a lot of action-
inspirational movies featuring mas-
culine white males saving the world 
or beating up other people. such as 
"Rambo." "Rocky" and "Raiders of 
the Lost Ark." 

Moore said that this trend goes 
back to the Vietnam War and the 
backlash against the ·60s. 

''The loss of me Vietnam War 
[wasl vety emasculating, a threat to 
the collective manhood of the U.S. 
And so you have these working class. 
white. male characters who go back 
to Vietnam to basically redeem me 
war that's been lost," Moore said. 

But whatever theme or category 
the films of the '80s were in. they 
set a standard for special effects and 
fniltion-dollar budgets mat remains 
to this day.

Lipsti z. said . "But I think that also 
mey produced a need and a market 
for smaller films - [onesl that show 
a broader range of American society 
and world society ... mat sometimes 
surprisingly became big hits. like 
' Desperately Seeking Susan,' which 
was Madonna's first hit."

such addictively fun sources of 
entertainment and virtual reality to

True. arcade and video games 
started in the late '70s with "Pong." 
"Space Invaders" and "Asteroids," 
but it was really me '80s mat saw 
such games explode into popularity 
and become an essential part of pop 
culrure. fueling a highly successful 
industry. 

1980 witnessed the release of 
the immortally popular craz.e that 
was "Pac-Man." and the introduc-
tion of the most beloved video 
gaille hero of all -time. Mario, in 
Nintendo's "Donkey Kong." 

T he industry proved it was here

"Tetris" in 1985 and the release of 
the Nintendo Entertai nment

Even with the elaborate graph-

ics and powerfu l technology of 
today's video games. me classics 
remain some of the most enjoyable 
and addicting games ever produced 
due to their innovation and superb 
gameplay. 

The impact of video games has 
been phenomenal. especially with 
me younger generation grO\ving up 
in the ·80s. The arcade quickly 
became one of the "cool" places to 
hang out. Video games possessed 
me power to make you scream, 
jump and practice hand-eye coor-
dination instead of just mindlessly 
staring at a screen . 

"[Video games are thel perfect 
capitalist enterprise." Moore said. 
"All you need is the acrual machi ne.

Resolution 
If the public wanted a good 

diversion from the dismal even ts 
and uncertainty of the world. it cer-
tainly got what it wanted - and 
more. 

Entertainment perperuatcd and 
fueled me greed and excess of the 
·80s. 

"The boundary between the 
media and society has totally 
imploded by me L 980s," Moore said. 
"There is no difference between 
popular culture and reality." 

"The thing I think that charac-
terizes the '80s the most is the 
backlash against the ·60s." Moore 

HIATUS 13 

continued. "It was a culture which 
celebrated greed and made fun of 
compassion. The whole pro-busi-
ness. free market culrure of the '80s 
gave us what we have today. saru-
rated with commerci als. media. 
celebrities. More man any other 
decade. the '80s contributed to the 
commercialization of society.» 

But for the entertainme nt-lover. 
the 1980s were a heavenly feast for 
the ears. eyes and hands. Frolll pop 
and rock to R&B and hip-hop. the 
decade gave birth to some of me 
best music ever of almost every 
genre. treated our eyes to ground-
breaking special e ffects in films and 
gave us a brand-new form of inter-
active entertai nme nt in video 
games. 

Love the decade or hate it. our 
generation can point to the 1980s 
as a more familiar origin of the 
state of popular culrure today.

nearly sweep all of the singles

The only singles loss for UCSD 
went to Swart when he fell to

the first set 6--l and the third set 6-

So, whar is the difference 
between our arhletics program 
and theirs? Thev have money -
we don't. [f our ;thletics program 
had the type of money UC Davis 
has, there's no limit to what we 
could do. We could have a foot-
ball team; we could get top 
recrui ts ; we could even offer 
scholarships. From there, we 
could move to Division r and gain 
television and radio contracts, 
which - since I know it's all the 

for the match or with the confer-
ence match the next day against 
rival Cal Poly Pomona. 

The 1ritons met their Division 
II rival . Cal Po ly Pomona, on 
Sunday morning. . 

UCSD jumped out to a 2- 1 lead 
in the doubles with Swatt and 
Chopra at No. 1 and the combina-
tion of Nagel and Albrecht at No. 
3, each recording narrow yet signif-
icant 9-7 victories. 

Wilson and Schroeter lost a 
tough 9-8 tiebreaking match at No. 
2 against Pomona's Ryan Terry and 
Andy Roland . 

Blake Wilson-Hayden at No.4 
and Schroeter at o . 6 collected 
the Tritons ' only singles wins for

begin to offer scholarships) Oh 
yeah, and I'm su re Stanford, 
UCLA and Berkeley are kicking 
themselves for the loss of academ-
ic quality thar resulted from their 
huge sports programs. 

The fact is, if our own admin-
istration is umvilling to support 
our athletic program, our com-
munity and the students won 't 
support it either. This will result 
in a lot of empty seats, as well as 
empty playing fields. And as most 
students have discovered here at 
UCSD, those are just absolutely 
no fun.

six straight games and the tiebreak-
er to fall behind Pomona's R.j. 
Villaroman. 

Chopra then proceeded to 
bounce back and win the seco nd 
set 7-5, but it was apparent hi s 
efforts were beginning to wear 
him down. 

fter building a 4-2 lead in the 
third and I1nal set, Cho pra was 
fo rced to call time-ollt due to 
cramps. After being exami ned by a 
traint:r, he returned to play and 
won the next game to estab lish a

more game to seal the victory. 

However, Villaroman refused to 
lay down, and he won the lleXI five 
games to give the Broncos a 7-5 
victory and hand the Tritons their 
first loss of the season. 

After the match, Steidlm'ayer

from his team's firs! loss of the year.

18 SPORTS 

Volleyball: 
UCSD next plays Brigham 
Young University 
Continued f rom page 20 

The Tritons went up by two at 
17 - IS and seemed to take an edge 
in the game, holding the lead. Eric 
Perrine, Waller and Keyser each 
contributed kills to help UCSD to 
22-20. 

Concordia would not back 
down, and due to some good serv-
ing, moved itself to 24-24, but that 
was as close as it would get. The 
Tnton attack picked it up a notch 
and outhit Concordia over the next 
II points to take the game 30-27. 

Waller ca me up big at the end 
of gamc two. He had three kills in 
the last II points. 

Larsen had nothing but good 
thing to say about his stanJout 
outside hitter. 

"Waller callle up big for us," 
Larsen said . "He had 22 kills and 
really dueled it Out with their out-
side hitter, Diego Escobar." 

Escobar is one of a plethora of 

international players o n the 
Concordia team, which fearures 
only one American team member. 
Hailing from Columbia, Escobar 
hit . ~22 on the night and matched 
Waller with 22 kills. Larsen was 
more than impressed with 
Escobar's performance. 

"That guy was overpowering," 
Larsen said. "It could have been a 
different story out there tonight if 
they would have set him more. He is 
really one of the best players I have 
seen all year - probably the best." 

Despite Escobar's talents, the 
Tritons were able to do enough to 
get past him and his teammates in 
the third game but not before 
making their way through some 
close quarters. 

UCSD went up by four at 10-6 
and seemed to be on a roll . Luis 
Mendez of Concordia got the 
serve, however, and slowed down 
the Tritons, pulling the Clippers 
to within a point at 10- 11. 

The game continued along this 
path ; UCSD would get a breath of 
fre h air and then Concordia 
would close the window and even 
the score. 

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

UCSD seemed to have more 
energy than Concordia, though, 
and by 22- 17 had the game in 

. hand, going up by five at two more 
points and eventually closing out 
the game 30-27. 

It was a good end to a weekend 
that had already seen three losses. 

"We played better out there 
today," Larsen said in praise of his 
team. "We are finding ourselves 
and what we can do out there with 
Matt Miller setting for us. " 

Miller had 47 assists on the 
night and has played settt:r lor the 
"lI'itons since Jordan Hove's knee 
injury last Friday. 

"There is somethi ng floating 
around in his knee," Larsen said. 
"We don't know if the injury is sea-
son-ending but we are adjusting." 

Without their setter, the scope 
of the Tritons' weekend was 
changed as they dropped two 
games over the weekend. Having 
Hove back will help UCSD 
against its next opponent New 
York University and in its big 
upcoming home matches against 
Brigham Young University on 
April 9 and April 10.

Next league win would

Continued from page 10 
fight. But the team's lone senior 
didn't give up so easily. 

Tadlock came back to win the 
set 6-4, breaking serve in the third 
and seventh games. But it was the 
dramatic third set that would bring 
out the best in both players . 
Tadlock seemed to have control of 
the match at 5-3, but Hammond 
won the next four sets to take the 5-
7 victory. Nearly every game went 
to deuce in this set, but Tadlock just 
didn't have enough to edge out the 
victory.

coach Liz LaPlante. "We'd obvi-
ously like to win more games up

teams that can compete with our 
depth.n 

lllustrating this depth, UCSD is 
now 4 1-3 in No. 3 to No. 6 singles 
and 11 -0 at No.3 doubles. 

With the 6-3 triumph the 
Tri tons took their record to 11 -0 
on the season and 7-0 in the 
CCAA. Pomona falls 8-2, 5-2 in 
the CCAA, and drops to third place 
behind UC Davis . The Tritons 
have the opportunity to win the 
CCAA regular season with a victo-
ry March 29 at Grand Canyon

Stoner: 
Administration listens to 
community, not students 
Continued from page 20 
fine. We think Pacific Beach and 
the city of San Diego are a lot more 
interesting, anyway. 

However, the same could not be 
said of our administration. 

[ believe a large part of our 
administration's poliCy panders to 
the community surrounding our 
school's campus rather than the snl-
dent community. 

Take, for example, rhe proposed 
beer garden at the UCSD-UC 
Davis basketball game. I personally 
think it was an awesome idea by the 
athletics deparonent, although it 
could have used better advertising 
since [ didn 't even hear about it 
until it was canceled by Vice 
Chancellor Joseph Watson . 
Supposedly, his reasoning behind 
the decision was that UCSD needs 
to re-eval ua te its alcohol policy. 
Bullshit. 

What alcohol policy' Our cam-
pus already has an extremely intol-
erant attitude regarding alcohol, 
much more so than other UC 
schools such as UCLA or Berkeley. 
Why? Well, let's JUSt say La Jolla 
and Berkeley resemble each other 
just about as much as [ resemble 
Anna Kournikova. 

For another example, take a look 
at the "Message to the Campus 
Communityn Watson recently sent 
Ollt. The very first line of it speaks 
not to UCSD, but to "the San 
Diego commtmity." One can also 
speculate about the reason behind 
the message. Why do students need 
to be told that they are condemning 
The Koala' Why is Watson con-
demning Tbe KOIJIa after it made fun 
of Danielle van Dam, yet he 
remained silent when Tbc Koala dis-
tastefully made fun of African-
Americans, Jews, Asians and homo-
sexuals, not to mention specific indi-
viduals? 

'r'll tell you why: Watson is 
aware of the attention the va n 
Dam incident has received in the 
San Diego community and is try-
ing to disassociate UCSD frum 
Tbr Koala :< portrayal of the inci-
dent. 

So what does this have to do with 
athletics? What is pretty much the 
only other option for fun on campus 
Friday and Saturday nights? Why, 
watch a basketball, volleyball , soc-
cer, water polo or lacrosse game. 
Get rowdy, grab a bunch of friends 
and scream insults at the opposing 
players uncil your tllroat is raw. 

But no, the UCSD administra-
tion limits that as well. God forbid 
they actually pony up money to 
upporr athletics, which, inciden-

tally, would benefit the San Diego 
community it is so worried about 
pleasing. 0, instead, students 
have to bailout athletics with an 
ath letics fec referendum. Why? 
Why should students have to sup-
port athletics with money that 
should be coming from the admin-
istration and outside community' 

Because th e community doesn 't 
care, and therefore, neitller does 
the UCSD ad miniso-ation. There 
arc two other Divi ion J schools 
right next to us, which receive the 
majority of the attention from the 
San Diego Sports community. Well, 
they are better than we are, right? 
So maybe they deserve it. 

Yet so far this year, we have 
beaten them in women's basketball, 
swimming and water polo. 

This lack of support has been no 
fault of the UCSD athletes. In 
UCSD's short time in Division II, 
it has already produced two 
National Championships and one 
third-place national finish . UCSD 
fi ni hed in the top 10 out of hun-
dreds of schools in last year's Sear's 
Cup competition for best athletic 
program, and this year it is current-
ly in fourth place. It is not an 
excuse that our athletics are less 
marketable or less productive than 
SDSU or USD's athletics.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN SPORT 19 

The answer to this Riddle: home ' run 
UCSD's designated hitter leads the way with his bat 
BY COURTNEY FIELD 
Staff Writer 

"Consistent" is the word that 
best describes UCSD baseball 
player Jeff Riddle. 

The sophomore out of 
Burlingame High School in 
Northern California has played 
haseball for over 12 years and has 
always been an asset to his squad, 
no matter what role he assumes. 

"J eff has always been willing to 
play any position, as long as he 
gets a bat in his hand," said broth-
er and teammate Garret Riddle. 
"He is probably the only guy on 
the team with a catcher's, outfield-
er's, infielder's and first baseman's 
glove in his bag. n 

No matter what position he 
plays, Riddle can always hit. In 92 
at-bats this year, he is batting .3 80; 
of his 35 hits, he has seven doubles, 
a tri pie and three home runs. 

"J elf has added the big left-
handed bat that we needed in the 
middle of our lineup," said Triton 
first baseman Chad Addison. ~He 
hits the ball well to all fields and 
takes advantage of our left-hand-
ed, hitting-friendly ballpark." 

I 

Teammate Matt Smith agreed. 
'1elf has had a huge impact in 

our offensive production," Smith 
said. "He has been extremely con-
sistent and has been driving in rwlS 
when we need them most. He hits 
the ball hard every time . ... That 
sets a tone for everyone in the line-
up." 

Batting fourth in the lineup, 
Riddle does exactly what his posi-
tion dictates: He cleans up. This 
year he has scored 13 TUns and 
leads the team \vith 20 RBis. He 
doesn't intend to stop there. 

'1 eff carries a presence up to 
the plate that lets everyone know 
he will get the job done - he has 
that necessary arrogance that rubs 
off on everyone else," Addison 
said. "Despite the fact that Jeff 
mostly DHs, his presence is felt in 
our lineup as our most dangerous 
hitter to opposing pitchers." 

Triton head coach Dan 
O'Brien concurs and recognizes 
Riddle's strength and ability as an 
all-around player. 

"Like many of the guys on our 
team, Jeff is a hard worker, but 
what separates him from the rest is 
his mentality toward the game," 

O'Brien said. "Jeff believes that he 
is better than any pitcher that he 
faces and doesn't believe that any-
one can get him out. His confi-
dence when he approaches the 
plate is what singles him out as an 
outstanding hitter." 

Riddle's performance on the 
field exemplifies the sort of player 
that every team desires. 

"J eff extends a sort of quiet 
leadership," O'Brien sa id . "He 
leads the team by example because 
he plays the game the way it is 
supposed to be played ." 

Though his main role is desig-
nated hitter, Riddle also plays 
catcher, and when he does, he per-
forms at the rop of his game. 

"The catcher is the general on 
the fi-:ld and he has to be a leader. 
He controls the tempo of the game 
and has control over virtually every 
pitch,n Slnith said. "Jeff- when he 
does get a chance to catch - defi-
nitely takes charge and establishes a 
sense of control on the game. He is 
one of the most focused players 
that I have ever played wi th." 

Smith also commented on 
Riddle's attitude and humor out-
side the game.

Big bat: Riddle has been integral to 
UCSD's success this year. 

"Jeff is kind of the silent guy in 
the back with a big-ass smil e pla s-
tered on his face . We call Jeff the 
'golden boy' because there is noth-
ing that he could do wrong," 
Smith said. ~All around, Jeff is a 
great guy, a good friend and awe-
some teammate."

fewer and the Tritons never led 
by more than five points in any 
one game. It was UCSD's abi lity 
to pull away at the end of each 
game that gave it the "w" for the 
afternoon. 

T he first game was a seesaw 
battle. Each team vied to take 
control of the game with some 
big play from the outside hitters, 
but neither could pull awa}'. The 
Tritons got a little bit of breath-
ing room at 15- 18 but were 
quickly rei gned in by the 
Clippers on a kill from Carlos 
Lopez and a service ace from 
Luis Mendez. 

The two teams traded points 
to 25-25 and then UCSD upped 
its game JUSt enou gh ro emerge 
with a 30-27 victory behind the 
strength of two kills from Jim 
Wa ll er and blocker Kevin 
Keyser, who hit .846 and con-
verted II of 13 attempts on the 
night. 

"Our middles played we ll 
tonight," said head coach Ron 
Larsen. "Brian hit .ova .SOO for 
us and Kevin really helped us to 
the win with his performance." 

The second ga me brought 
more close pia} as the teams 
stayed even untill 3-3 . 

Concordia took a hort-lived 
lead at 5-3, but a kill by Kaiser 
and an error on Concordia 
squared it up.
