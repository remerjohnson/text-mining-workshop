U CSD Students Assaulted 
By Supermarket Employees 

By RANDY DOTINGA 
Staff Writer 

Three UCSD students reported 
being assualted by Ralphs em-
ployees in the La Jolla Village 
Square Convenience Center early 
Wednesday morning, after not 
being allowed to buy beer. 

Gene Brown, senior vice presi-
dent of human resources and pub-
lic information at Ralphs' main 
office in Los Angeles, said he was 
unable to comment on the inci-
dent, because he had "learned 
that a lawsuit has been filed and 
there may be a countersuit ... " 

Warren sophomore David 
Maddow, the most severely in-
jured assault victim, however, said 
he has filed no suit. 

According to Revelle junior 
Kira "Kiwi" Reinhart, she, Mad-
dow, and Muir sophomore Don 
VanWinkle went to Ralphs to 
buy beer early Wednesday at 
about I :30 a.m. after going to 
Wally Malone's restaurant for 
drinks. . 

"They refused to sell It to us 
because we were intoxicated ... 
[so] Don and I walked out," 

Reinhart said . "Dave turned 
around and started yelling ob-
scenities. " 

Maddow recounted that, "On 
the way out, I was just making 
some rude comments to [Ralphs 
employee Rob Perrine). The next 
thing I knew, I woke up in the 
hospital. We were outside the 
door when [Perrine] came after 
us. I blacked out when I hit the 
pavement." 

According to witness Brigitte 
Berry who was waiting in her 
parked car, her group of friends 
was attacked by several Ralphs 
employees. 

Berry said that Reinhart, Mad-
dow, and VanWinkle "didn't 
initiate anything outside ... they 
were jumped from behind." 

VanWinkle, describing the 
scene, said he was the last of his 
group to leave the store. "There 

were four or five of them running 
at us," VanWinkle said, "And 
then two of them stopped and 
jumped me ... and they were on 
Dave. They got me on the ground 
and were hitting and kicking me. 

"All of a sudden they weren't 
on top of me, and I jumped up 
and Kiwi was right there and they 
punched Kiwi," he continued. 

Reinhart said that the alterca-
tion ended when the participants 
noticed that "Dave was uncons-
cious and there was a big puddle 
of blood coming from the back of 
his head." 

At that point, the police and an 
ambulance were called, and Mad-
dow was taken to Scripps Hospi-
tal. Neither Reinhart nor Van-
Winkle required hospitalization. 

Maddow, during a phone in-
terview, reported that he suffered

UCSD Police File Charges 
Against Five Protesters 

V.P. External Controversy Heard by 
A.S. Board; Verdict Expected by Friday 

By CATHERINE DILLE 
Stajl Writer 

The UCSD Police Department 
has decided to press charges 
against five UCSD students in-
volved in the April 17th Price 
Center protest. 

because in a worst-case scenario, 
the Board would decide to uphold 
the informal resolution. 

Other students arrested said 
that they had not yet decided 
whether or not they will accept 
their college dean's informal 
resolutions. By RANDY DOTINGA 

Staff Writer 

An A.S. Judicial BOard deci-
sion in the case of Craig Peters vs. 
Mishka Migacl, heard Tuesday 
night, is expected to be rendered 
sometime tomorrow. The decision 
should settle the contest over the 
position of A.S. vice president 
external. 

Tuesday's case was a review of 
an A.S. Election Committee 
Board of Inquiry's decision ren-
dered April 24, which declared 
Migacl guilty of A.S. election 
bylaw violations filed against her 
by Peters. The board also declared 
Peters to be the new vice presi-
dent external, a position formerly 
held by Mordecai Potash. 

Migacl appealed that decision 
to the A.S. Judicial Board which, 
last Thursday, ruled that Migacl 
was to fill the contested office 
because Peters had not filed an 
official complaint form requested 
by the Board. 

An informal agreement was 
later reached between Migacl, 
Peters, and Board Chairperson 
Jon Berke that Peters would 
resume the position upon sending 
the Board the required complaint 
form. Peters' hold on the position 
was contingent, however, upon 
the result of Tuesday's hearing. 

In Tuesday's hearing, Peters 

said, "I'm not here to be petty .. . I 
feel my opponent made violations 
that are serious enough and blat-
ant enough to give an unfair 
advantage over me and conse-
quently affected the outcome of 
the election [and] warrant her 
disqualification. " 

.. As my friends know me, I am 
not a dishonest person. My cam-
paigning didn't change any of 
that," Migacz responded. 

Peters went on to allege that 
M igacl did not report some of the 
flyers she used in the run-off elec-
tion and that she also went over 
the run;ofrs $50 spending limit. 

Peters presented statements 
from A.S. secretaries Patty Sulli-
van and Roxanne Lin in which 
they denied receiving receipts for 
the flyers in question from Migacl. 

Migacl claimed that she did 
sumbit the flyers to the A.S. office, 
and denied going over her run-off 
spending limit. 

"On Monday, April 17 [Lin] 
accepted my material for the run-
off election .. . I turned the flyer 
in, and I feel that it was mistak-
enly lost," she said. 

Peters also alleged that Migacl 
went door-ta-door soliciting for 
votes in the Muir apartments and 
by doing so, violated Muir Col-
lege posting rules. 

He presented several statements 
from Muir apartment residents 
who said that Migacl knocked on 

their doors for the purpose of 
campaigning. 
. Migacl, who admitted that she 
went door-to-door in the apart-
ments, said that Muir Assistant 
Resident Dean Kathie Poff had 
given her permission to do so 
when she asked Poff for clarifica-
tion concerning Muir College 
campaigning rules. 

"I interpreted her response as a 
'yes,' which was a nod and a 
'yeah.' When Kathie nods and 
says 'yeah' I interpret that as clari-
fication, " she said. 

Peters, though, presented a 
written statement signed by Poff, 
which explained that she had 
never given Migacl permission to 
solicit in the Muir apartments. 

Peters also alleged that Migacl 
violated election bylaws by ap-
pearing at a Women's Resource 
Center rally on an election day. 
At the rally, Migacl spoke and 
displayed to the crowd a flyer 
which read "Vote Mishka." 

"She had an opportunity at the 
Women's Resource Center rally 
to speak to over 100 people," 
Peters said of his political rival. 
"Mishka used this opportunity as 
an effective campaign tool to gain 
votes." 

Migacl, however, offered a dif-
ferent interpretation of her ap-
pearance at th rally. 

". had no intention of letting 
See JUDICIAL, pall J 

Rather than requesting arrest 
warrants from the Sc,tn Qiego City 
Attorney's Office, UCSD Police 
are pressing charges through the 
UCSD College Judicial Board 
system against the four students 
arrested on the day of the protest. 

The charges against the stu-
dents were first approved by Stu-
dent Conduct Coordinator Nick 
Aguilar. The students were then 
contacted by their respective col-
lege deans. 

Tbe college deans have the 
option of dropping the charges 
or, if an arrested student agrees, 
the dean can. decide on a punitive 
measure, agreed upon by the stu-
dent in ao informal resolution. 

If the arrested student does not 
agree to comply with the informal 
resolution, then a formal college 
judicial board hearing can be 
requested by the student. 

Jeffrey Kile, one of the protes-
ters arrested, decided against 
accepting Muir Dean Charles 
Dreilinger's informal resolution 
suggestion. 

"I have chosen to exercise my 
right to a formal hearing by the 
Muir Judicial Board," Kile said. 

Kile said that Dreilinger's pro-
posal was "not acceptable at all." 
He "ent on to explain that the 
hearing was in his best interest 

Arnie Schoenberg, a student 
not arrested during the protest, 
was later contacted by the San 
Diego City Attorney's Office and 
told that charges had been leveled 
against him by the UCSD Police 
for vandalism and disturbing the 
peace during the protest. 

Schoenberg said that he believes 
the vandalism charges were for 
stepping on newly planted grass 
and disturbing a balloon display 
during the protest. 

He added, though, that "I think 
the City Attorney will drop my 
charges. They don't have any 
foundation. " 

When asked why Schoenberg's 
charges were processed through 
the City Attorney's Office rather 
than through the UCSD College 
Judicial Board system, UCSD 
Police Lieutenant J. Dyer said, 
that "In Schoenberg's case, he has 
been involved in a number of 
incidents, and he just doesn't seem 
to get the message. He was 
responsible for the Price Center 
fiasco. " 

Kile urged that students who 
witnessed the Price Center protest 
contact the Free Speech Legal 
Defense Committee, of which he 
is\ member. The Committee con-
sists of a group of students who 
organized themselves in mid-April 
to oppose the lack of a free speech 
area at the Price Center.

farming, strip mining, bridges, irrigation projects, and 
settlement patterns have left their imprint on the 
American land rna s. The film contrasts Indian and 
European notions of land use and the issues involved 
in the regulation of natural resources. The film is 
approximately 60 minutes long. 

Both films will be shown free on Friday, May 19 at 
7 p.m. in Third Lecture Hall room 107.

UC Berkeley Students Smash TVs 
On Campus, Police Respond 

:1 

BERKELEY - A television-smashing event to 
demonstrate the harmful effects of television turned 
into a violent confrontation between students and UC 
Berkeley police April 27 on Sproul Plaza. 

Students have destroyed television sets on Sproul 
Plaza each of the past two years to protest what they 
say is televison's influence in American society and its 
control by corportaions and government. 

The police tried to stop the unauthorized event by 
carrying away the demonstrator's television sets, 
which were placed on the steps of Sproul Hall and on 
Sproul Plaza. 

About 10 police officers hit and pushed several 
demonstrators who had locked arms to keep the 
officers from carrying away the last of the sets. 

According to police Lt. Pat Carroll, the police 
interrupted the demonstration because of the 
dangerous conditions surrounding television 
smashings. 

Carroll said that the event typically includes "iron 
bars swinging aimlessly, [with] breaking glass flying 
everywhere. " 

Police began hauling the sets away from the steps 
of Sproul Hall, causing a brief shoving match between 
police and demonstrators who claimed to own the 
television sets. 

The sets near the fountain were then also carted 
away. The police, holding the last of the sets, pushed 
their way through a ring of students. 

As the police made their way towards the police 
station in Sproul Hall, they pushed and struck several 
demonstrators who had chained their arms together 
and blocked the steps leading to the building. 

After the struggle, UC Berkeley alumnus Steve 
Masover spoke to approximately 100 people next to 
the University police station, calling the televison an 
"instrument of state and corporate control." 

This is the third year that the television smashing 
has taken place, but the first time police have 
intervened, according to a University spokesperson.

Dave said something about his

More Medical Waste 
Washes Up On Beaches 
By MARY BElTY HEARD 
Staff Writer 

Another batch of medical waste 
washed up on Oceanside and Del 
Mar beaches last Wednesday. 
Evidence suggests that the waste, 
like that found in November, may 
be linked to the military. 

According to Linda Miller, 
spokesperson for the San Diego 
County District Attorney's Office, 
"some papers with information" 
were found among the waste. 
While Miller said the papers have 
not yet been identified, the Los 

Angeles Times recently reported 
that the documents appeared to 
be military in nature. 

Miller also said that last week's 
waste consisted of hypodermic 
needles , syringes, vials and latex 
gloves . 

The exact amount of medical 
debris washed up has not yet been 
determined because "it's been 
coming in since last Wed nesday," 
according to Miller. 

Miller said that the District 
Attorney's Office hopes to have 
more information about the origin 
of the medical waste soon and 
explained that "we've just begun 
the investigation."

_______ O __ P!~~~O~N----__ __ 
Editor S ote: In light of the recent completion of the trial of Oliver 

North, wefind this column. published July 13. 1987. to be of particular 
interest. 

SOME TIME AROUND noon on Thursday, last week, I took a break from the Ollie North show on TV and drove down to Woody Creek Tavern for lunch. It was one of those fine, bright 
mornings that can make the ' idea of living 8,000 feet up in the 
mountains on a half-paved dead-end road seem very wise and elegant, 
instead of that crazy dumb feeling that you get on some days in the 
winter. 

The tavern was not crowded at that hour, except for a few stools at 
the far end of the bar, where a small crowd of cowboys and beer hippies 
were nursing long-necked Budweisers and staring balefully at a "pro 
wrestling" rerun on E PN. 

obody spoke when I sat down and dumped my brown bag full of 
mail and newspapers on the bar and ritled through the pile for anything 
that looked like a check. But there was nothing except two bills from 
Time magazine and a handwritten note from the garbage man, sayi ng 
that my cans were no longer serviceable and he was cutting me off until 
I got new ones. 

I tossed it away and asked Crazy Bob, sitting next to me, if the Meat 
Loaf Special was any good . 

"Nothing is good ," he replied . "Tonight is the full moon. Terrible 
thing are happening. AI got kicked by a horse and Terry lost one of his 
eyes when he got in a fight with a stranger. The whole valley smells like 
death. " 

I noticed that it was time for the Ollie North Show to start up again 
on TV - so I grabbed the remote-control unit and punched the 
channel over to C N, where Bernard Shaw was saying, "Col. Torth is 
about to undergo another round of tough interrogation this afternoon." 

" Hot damn !"' said Crazy Bob. "This should be good. He's been 
beating the crap out of those wimps all morning." 

The man next to him laughed and shifted his stool for a better view 
of the TV set. Somebody behind us at a table yelled, "Turn up the 
goddamn volume! I want to hear this." 

I was surprised . The tavern is not normally a hotbed of big-time 
political discourse. On most days I like to have a firm grip on a fork 
before switching the tube over to a news channel .. . . But not today. 
The e boys were definitely hookedon Oliver orth. They had adopted 
him, for some reason; it was like a gang of teen-agers seeing "Rocky" 
for the first time. 

The proceedings opened, as usual , with another lecture on duty, 
honor and patriotism by Oliver North - in response, once again, to 
some waterwit question by the committee's main mouthpiece, John 
Nields, a wretched little jellyfish who somehow got himself appointed 
as chief counsel for the House of Representatives' side and had been 
doing most of the questioning for three days. 

Crazy Bob was getting so many laughs from listening to Nields that 
he said his ribs were starting to hurt. "Jesus!" he said. " If I ever go to 
court I hope they give me this guy for a prosecutor. He probably cuts 
grass for Ed Meese." 

Nields was clearly a hired fool of some kind. Every question he 
served up to North was like tossing meat to a wolf. By the end of the 
Thursday session, orth had been fed so many home-run balls that he 
and his lawyer were laughing out loud and slapping each other on the 
back every time Nields asked a question - and then North would give 
another 20-minute speech about how much he loved his wife and his 
children and his uniform and , above all , his commander-in-chief, The 
President. 

By midnight on Thursday, Oliver North was a national hero and his 
"Legal Defense Fund" was so swollen with contributions that even 
George Bush was sayi ng that he might be the next president of the 
United States, or even head of the PTL Club. 

Bush came out of hiding for the first time in many months and laid 
claim to North like he 'd just found a long-lost son, calling him a great 
American hero with the heart of Charles Lindbergh and the gonads of 
Gen . Patton . 

O NE PUBLIC OPINION poll on Friday had North witha truly awesome "approval rating" of 94 to 4 percent, much higher than Ronald Reagan, Jesus or even pure cocaine. The Iran-
Contra scandal that once looked deeper and di rtier than Watergate was 
suddenly transformed by North's performance on network TV into 
something on the scale of American heroism like Valley Forge or 
MacArthur's return to the Philippines . .. . The shameful saga of Oliver 
North was so heavy and strong that it caused rich men on Wall Street 
to weep openly and small children in Hollywood to dance and jabber 
with joy. 

II even brought tears to the eyes of Crazy Bob. "This guy is the real 
thing, "he said when North went of the air on Thursday. "I want to send 
him a check." 

I stared at him for a long moment , then I whacked him on the side of 
his head. "You foo!!" I said . " I'm tired of your lame Nazi gibberish." 

He leaped off his stool and went into a fighting stance, but I quickly 
jumped back and hissed at him: "Semper Fi! Semper Fi! 269 dead 
boys at the Beirut Airport ! Two hundred and sixty-nine dead U.S. 
Marines, Bobby!" 

He stiffened, then dropped his hands. 
"Yes!" I shouted . "And we know who did it, don't we?" 
" Iranians," he muttered . "That stinking Ayatollah." 
I knew he had been in the Navy - nine or /0 years in one of the 

super-elite SEAL units ... the Marines get a lot of publicity and they 
look good on TV commercials, but even drill sergeants at Parris Island 
will admit that 99 out of 100 Marine recruits would be routinely

Letters 

Pro-life or 
Pro-choice? 
Editor: 

At the risk of contributing to a 
long, heated, and frui tless debate , 
I feel compelled to respo nd to 
Andrew Carroll's letter in Mon-
day's Guardian. Both the liberal 
who (as he points out) condemns 
vivisection and the death penalty 
as state-sponsored murder while 
condo ning abortion, and the con-
servative who does the reverse, 
show a certai n amount of incon-
sistency. I honestly don't know 
how I would decide, were it strictly 
a question of logic. 

But there is a simple, social rea-
son I am not out blockading 
abortion clinics: because people 
like Carrol are! I'm sure some so-
called "pro-lifers" are motivated 
by honest compassion for the 
fetus, but many (I suspect a 
majority) have another concern 
foremost in the ir minds. 

They view pregnancy as a just 
punishment for "immorality," by 
which they ty pically mean sex 
outside the norms of Judeao-
Christian religious doctrine . For 
the same reason, while claiming 
illegalizing abortion will reduce 
the spread of AIDS, the same 
people agitate against sex educa-
tion. free condoms and needles in 
the inner cities, all of which seem , 
more direct ways to do the same 
job. 

Pregnancy should not be a 
punishment for anything! 

Andrew, if I've misread your 
letter and the above is not part of 
your sentiments, I apologize. If 
not, I ask you and all pro-lifers to, 
just for a moment, forget the idea 
of punishment and examine what's 
left. If you still reach the same 
conclusion, fine; but only then 
can you call yourself "pro-life~ 
rather than "anti-choice."

PLO: Like a Virgin 
Editor: 

I can't believe that anyone who 
goes to UCSD and calls himself 
educated can actually sit back 
and accept the distortion of facts 
and misrepresentation that goes 
on in the Guardian newspaper 
without speaking up about it. 

I am writing about the letter 
written by Mr. Jeffrey Hoffer 
entitled, "The PLO and Israel" 
(Guardian, May 15). (\ hope that 
my voice will actually be heard 
and this letter printed or else I will 
be forced to believe that there is 
no such thing as freedom of speech 

in America.) 
It has been more than 41 years 

now that the Israelis, (imported, 
foreign Jews) have refused to rec-
ognize the Palestinians as a peo-
ple, let alone their right to exist 
and their rights to self-determin-
ation . 

The Israelis refuse to accept the 
fact that there are, were, have 
been and always will be inhabit-
ants to that piece of land which 
Jews from everywhere in the world 
seized by blatant force and vio-
lence and renamed Israel.

Third Hiring Process Fair 
Editor: 

We would like to express our 
gratitude to David K.ritzer for his 
leiter (Guardian, May II). This 
letter validates the effectiveness of 
the selection process at Third 
College. His letter brought home 
the point that the most qualified 
individuals regardless of race, 
religion and gender are indeed 
selected. 

We would like to assist Kritzer 
by fact uaUy detailing the processes 
by which the administrators are 
chosen. These are in accordance 
with the University'S equal oppor-

tunity employment policy. The 
process through which staff is 
hired at Third College is the same 
as it is for the other colleges at the 
University. 

Student volunteers are solicited 
from the student body then team-
ed with current staff and faculty 
from the University community. 
In the car.e of the Resident Ad-
visors the selection committee 
consists of students from their 
respective colleges. They choose 
from the intial pool of applicants 
who then go on to final interviews.

Teach English on Another Continent 

Job Opportunities Extend Far and Wide 
By CHERIE PIATKIEWICZ 
Contributing Writer 

Looking for a summer job? 
Why not go for an underwater 
modeling position in the Mediter-
ranean? If hard labor i your style, 
volunteer to work on a kibbutz in 
Israel. Or, if you're a romantic, 
harvesting peache in the valleys 
of the Loire and Rhone may 
interest you. 

The on-campus Opportunities 
Abroad Office (DAO), along with 
the Career ervices Center, pro-
vide information on a va riety of 
oversea option for tudent s, 
including short and long-term 
employment and inte rnships. Re-
sources are available to help stu-
dents job hunt abroad, but most 
organizations advise prospective 
over ea workers to deal with an 
established program to assist in 
their search. Many of the pro-
grams require a fee of approxi-
mately $20-$IOO, and some call for 
full-time student status and know-
ledge of a foreign language. 

Dne program that helps employ 
many V .S. students in countries 
around the world is the Council 
on International Educational Ex-
change (CIEE). According to the 
program' sponsors , CIEE can 
generally find employment for a 
student in about one week. Many 
job provided through CIEE are 
unskilled labor, but the options 
are limitless. 

Short-term unskilled job are 
the easiest tn find abroad , but 
work camps and volunta ry ser-
vice projects - which incorpo-
rate manual labor and commun-
ity service needs - are also plent-
iful. The OAO also has informa-
tion about internships that are 
designed for trainees in fields such 
as economics. business, architec-
ture. math, and sciences. As in the 
U .S., long-term career-related jobs 
are the most diffi cult to come 
across in foreign countries. The 
applicants most likely to be hired 
for this type of position are those 
who are able to meet the com-
munities' needs , especially doc-
tors, nurses, and teachers . 

The Japanese English Teach-
ing Program (JET) places many 

strf~t f'Oet rIA"! 

.,0 to c./ IA 11$ 
S~t'k "",.,."" row"", 

people in two type of position : 
international business activities 
and teaching English as a second 
language in Japane e schools. To 
qualify for thi program, appli-
cants must be U.S . citizens, have 
excellent proficiency in the Eng-
lish language, be under 35 years 
of age, and have at least a B.A. 
degree. 

Megan arroll, a 1987 UCSD 
graduate and returnee from the 
JET program, got started through 
the DAO on campus. Carroll 
worked as a teacher in a high-
level sc hool , comparable to an 
honors class in the U.S . 

Ninety-nine percent 
of the schools Friends 
of World Teaching 
work with do not 
require teaching 
credentials. 

"If there's one thing I can ay 
about the program, it's that case 
by case. everyone has a different 
experience," she commented. 

According to Carroll, some 
participants do not know in what 
part of the country they will be 
staying until they arrive; others 
are notified a month ahead of 
time. They also do not know if 
they will be permanently placed 
in one school or work as a guest 
lecturer in a different school each 
day. 

Carroll feels that she was for-
tunate to be placed in one school 
for the entire year because of the 
bond she built with her students. 
In the school where she worked , 
most of the students had ~a keen 
desire to learn English ." Since her 
students wanted the entire course 
taught in English, they discour-
aged her from speaking Japanese 
in the classroom . For someone 
working in a lower-level school, 
where the students would be less 
fluent in English, the circumstan-
ces would be very different, she 
said. 

Working as a co-teacher , Car-

\. Ck of lov~

roll had the freedom to be flexible 
and creative. ~Since I had no pre-
vious experience, there was a lot 
of trial and error the first few 
months, " she explained . 

The subjects of Carroll's Eng-
lish class not only encompassed 
grammar and vocabulary, but 
also addressed discrimination in 
the U.S., and Japanese culture. 
The students learned about V.S. 
culture and practiced listening 
kills by watching "Family Ties." 

They expressed their thoughts on 
all of these topics through crea-
tive writing exercises. 

Carroll feels that working 
through a program is the only 
way to avoid unnecessary hassles 
and to receive extensive advice 
and invaluable help while abroad . 

" When I gOl to Japan, I took 
for granted that my apartment 
had a telephone .. . actually, 
without the help of the program, 
it would have taken months , lots 
of paperwork, and $1 ,000 just to 
get permission to have a phone 
where I lived ." 

In one word , Carroll described 
her experiences as "wonderful" 
but also stressed to prospective 
applicants that working and liv-
ing in a foreign country is full of 
challenges. In addition to being a 
teacher, Carroll was expected to 
give a lot to the community. She 
attended PTA functiOl1!and indi-
vidual dinners at students' homes 
almost every night. 

"After working a full day, it 
was stressful to have these kind of 
commitments, but I was expected 
to give time to the community," 
she said . According to Carroll , 
another pressure she had to deal 
with was often being the center of 
attention, even in the markets . 

"In general, the Japanese are a 
very warm, welcoming people, 
but with a distinct lifestyle. I think 
one of the most important things 
I, oranyone traveling abroad , has 
to do is become accustomed to 
the new lifestyle and culture 
they're in," she concluded. 

Another organization, Friends 

"If there's one 
thing I can say about 
the program, it's that 
case by case, every-
one has a dnferent 
experience. " 

-Megan Carroll 

of World Teaching, supplies pro-
spective overseas teachers with 
contacts in English speaking 
schools around the world. Each 
applicant may initially request 
contacts in three countries. Louis 
Bajkai, director of the program 
and former teacher, said he likes 
to concentrate on the needs of 
graduating seniors, because they 
seem to appreciate the overseas 
experience most. • 

Ninety-nine percent of the 
schools this organization works 
with do not require teaching cre-
dentials, and all are for English 
speaking children whose parents 
live abroad . Beneficial qualifica-
tion for a graduating student 
with no teaching experience in-
clude involvement with tutoring, 
leadership positions. volunteer or 
paid work for children 'S organiza-

tions such as the YMCA or Boy 
Scouts, and a strong desire to 
teach. 

The best places for a graduat-
ing senior to apply, according to 
Bajkai, are Far Eastern countries, 
most of Africa (especially Kenya 
and Egypt), Central and South 
America, and Puerto Rico. Baj-
kai has found that these regions 
have a great need for English 
speaking teachers . 

Competition for Europeanjobs, 
on the other hand, is stiff. Appli-
cants strivillg for European jobs 
outweigh other countries' appli-
cants three to one and often in-
clude experienced teachers . 
Friends of World Teaching pro-
vides information on approxi-
mately 6,000 job openings per 
year, ranging from nursery school 
to junior college levels. They 
include English as a Second lan-
guage classes and special educa-
tion for handicapped children. 

Although Bajkai admits that 
only a small percentage of those 
hired are seniors graduating from 
college, he pointed out that some 
schools look specifically for fresh 
talent that has not been shaped by 
any panicular school system. 

The individual schools do the 
actual screening and hiring, as 
well as provide information on 
salary, housing, the school year, 
and curriculum. The overseas 
schools work with the program's 
participants to obtain a working 
visa and other necessary docu-
ments . 

" We have a high success rate. 
The experiences our participants 
obtain abroad are invaluable for 
later job opportunities in Ameri-
can school districts," Bajkai said.

Israel 
Continued from page 4 

The natural inhabitants of this 
land , the indigenous population, 
are called Palestinians and the 
land they inhabited was once upon 
a time called Palestine. At the 
present time, these Palestinians 
now inhabit the West Bank and 
Gaza and other countries as well 
since they were pushed oul of 

their true homeland by foreign 
occupants called Ashkenazi Jews. 

Palestine was renamed Israel in 
1948 by the foreign settlers, the 
immigrant European Jews, after 
many years ofthe use of violence , 
tyranny, and terrorism to achieve 
this aim. Violence and terrorism 
were trademarks of that region 
and were the weapons that the 
European Jews had used to suc-

Reverse Racism Doesn't Exist? 
Editor: 

Mark Fedele and Michael Bar-
raclough write one short and very 
inoffen ive letter about reverse 
racism (Guardian, May I) and 
what happens? The Guardian is 
still packed with angry rebuttals 
condemning them as Nazis and 
white supremacists . 

This fact only serves to prove 

Mark and Michael'S point. Not 
all whites are rich, power-hungry 
neo-Nazis. That is just another 
racial stereotype. 

The truth is, reverse racism is 
much more common and blatant 
than most people are willing to 
believe. I'm not just talking about 
preferential treatment given to

OPINION 

Palestine 
Continued from pile 7 
responsible for the deaths of 88 
civilians when he bombed the 
King David Hotel in 1947. He 
wa also respon ible for the mas-
sacre of the whole village of Deir 
Ya«in. Ariel Sharon was respon-
sible for the whole vilb.ge of Kibye 
which is no longer on the map 
today but used to be East of Jer-
usalem in 1959. 

If there ever was a gangster 
organization of murderers, it was 
the Stern Gang and Irgun of 
whom Ariel Sharon and Mena-
chern Begin were leaders. The 
Irgun and the Stern Gang regu-
larly organized raids against vil-
lages and killed hundreds upon 
hundreds of innocent people. I 
don't know how Mr. Hoffer can 
attempt to debase the PLO when 
it was the Zioni t Ashkenazi Jews 
before 1948 and the Israeli after 
1948 that used such monstrous 
and deplorable mean to acheive 
their purposes. 

Had it not been for the terrorist 
ta'ctics of the Zionist Jews, had 
they not been successful in their 
deeds of deception to the whole 
world , the state of Israel would 

nothave been born. Zionism itself 
as a whole movement has been 
condemned by the United Nations 
in 1975 as a form of racism. 
Zionism is racism, so therefore 
Israel is a racist stale because it is 
built upon a racist foundation 
and ideology. In comparison to 
the terrorism, murders, slaugh-
terous massacres, false pretenses, 
propaganda , and the general 
falsehoods of the Israeli, the 
PLO is 'like a virgin.' 

It is the greatest myth in the 
modern world to think that Israel 
is a nation fighting for its survival. 
The truth of the matter is that 
Israel is a major military power, 
the 6th in the world, with nuclear 
ca pabilities as well. Israel is not 
threatened by the PLO or all the 
Arab states combined and it would 
even stand up against the United 
States and Russia if the U.S. 
and / or Russia became obstacles 
to Israel's territorial objectives 
and goals. Take for example what 
Israel did to the American Intelli-
genceShip - The U.S.S. Liberty: 
" In June 1967, jet aircraft and 
motor torpedo boats of Israel 
brutally assaulted an American 
naval vessel, the U.S.S. Liberty, in 
international waters off the Sinai 
Peninsula in the Mediterranean

Continued from page 4 
the committees review submitted 
applications and resumes. Mem-
bers take seriously the responsi-
bilityand work diligently to find 
the best applicant for the position. 
To re~mphasize , there is no single 
individual who makes a staff or 
administrative appointment. 

For the selection of the college 
administrators the process is con-
siderably more stringent. When a 
dean or provost selection becomes 
necessary, faculty, staff and ad-
ministrators are drawn from 
throughout the University to work 
with the college's staff and student 
representatives. 

Such a process can only work 
to ensure the most fair selection of 
the best candidate for the position 
regardless of race, gender or 
religion. Kritzer argues "One need 
only look at the racial make up of 
[Third] administration to see the 
scourge of reverse racism." To 
suggest that less whites in certain 
positions is proof of "reverse 
racism" implies that thf' most 
qualified people are not in these 
jobs. One would think that from a 
state with a population as diverse 
in races and cultures as California, 
the best talent could be found in 
wide variety of shapes and shades. 

Lastly, an important fact you 
failed to mention in your letter is 
that you, Mr. Kritzer, are part of 
the Third College staff/ leadership 
and have benefitted from these 
selection processes for the past 
three years.

Racism 
Continuec1 from pale 7 
minorities (which can be justified 
to some extent). I'm talking about 
outright bigotry. 

I am a white male of German 
ancestry. I am a member of a class 
that is stereotyped as being the 
most racist - the "whitest" of the 
white supremacists. Does anyone 
believe that I am not a member of 
the Klan? Is it possible that I 
actually have friends who are 
Jewish? Is it possible that I am 
offended by being called a Nazi or 
a "Kraut"? 

Nobody seems to care; after all, 
I'm white, and reverse racism 
doesn't exist.

Men's Tennis Falls in First 
Round; Finishes Sixth 

By PHIL GRUEN 
Sports Editor 

After some 2,000 miles of 
traveling, the Triton men's 
tennis team received a rude 
greeting on Monday when host 
Kalamazoo College of Michi-
gan defeated it 5-1 in the first 
round of the Division 1II 
National Championship. 

The Tritons went on to split 
its remaining two consolation 
matche , beating the Univer-
sity of the South 6-3 on Tues-
day, but falling to Washington 
and Lee University by that 
same core yesterday, 

UCSD, as determined by its 
performance in the alionals, 
finished a the sixth-ranked 
Division /II team in the nation. 
Last year, the Tritons finished 
eighth. 

I n the first round los to 
Kalamazoo, UCSD gOt a vi -
tory at number one singles 
when Sig Huber defeated Dave 
Bor ki 6-4, 6-4. But that was it. 

Kalama zoo, aided by orne 
tight wins at number Ihree and 
four singles, proceeded to 
sweep the rest of the ingles 
matche and eliminate the 
Tritons from contention for 
the ational Title. The winner 
of the tournament was un-
known to the Guardian at pre s 
time, 

UCSD rebounded against 
University of the South on 
Tue day, I'!ading 4-2 after sin-
gles and capturing two double 

victories to clinch the match. 
Though Huber lost his ingles 
match, Francois Monnar, 
Randy Mark, Chri Belloli , 
and John Park all won theirs 
forthe Tritons. UC D received 
doubles victorie from Huber-
Belloli and Mark-Tim Ditzler 
in the 6-3 win. 

Yesterday, in another con-
solation match, the Tritons 
only received singles victories 
from Bellol i and Park and a 
doubles victory from Mark-
Ditzler in a 6-3 loss. 

UCSD finished with an over-
all record of 15-12,

Baseball A ttempts to Avenge Regular-Season Defeat 

UCSD to Face Stanislaus in Regionals 
By CHRIS ZAHARIAS 
Staff Writer 

T he word of the week for the 
fifth-ranked UCSD base ball team 
is revenge. 

Chosen to participate in the 
CAA Division 111 Western Re-

gional this coming weekend in a 
best of five series with 14th-ranked 
Cal tate Stanislaus, the Tritons 
will have the chance to make 
amends for a hotly disputed 5-4 
loss ea rlier this season against 
that very team. 

This time, however, the Tritons 
hope to have only one opponent 
instead of two. 

According to Head Coach Lyle 
Yates, when UCSD faced Stanis-
laus on the road in early April , it 
faced not only a tough squad , bul 
also a group of umpires partial to 
the home team. This could be a 
problem again this weekend for 
the Tritons, as all of the regional 
games will be hosted by Stanislaus. 

[n the regular season contesl , 
after rallying back from what 
seemed a sure win for Stanislaus, 
UCSD fell victim to whal Yates 
la beled "creative officia ting ." 
Yates spent the rest of the game 
watching from behind the fence . 

Yates, though, was quick 10 
note how much his team has 
improved since it last met Stani-
slaus. 

"Physically, we're a totally dif-
ferent team. [Leadoff batter Erik] 
Judson, who was out the first half 
of the season with a back injury, is 
healthy, as is seco nd baseman 
Anthony Sanchez," he said. 

UC D (23-16) will need to be

healthy for the best three-of-five 
series again t tanislaus (20-17), a 
team noted for its outstanding 
offense. 

The Tritons, however, havewon 
six of their last eight and five of 
their last six. 

Junior J.J. Fisher (7-1), will 
stan Friday's 3 p.m. opener. He 
currently leads the team with 69 
sl rikeouls, 

Sunday games will be scheduled 
if necessary. 

The Tritons discovered they 
had been se lected to the Western 
Regionals earlier this week, oust-
ing 28-8 Cal State San Bernar-
dino from the tournament on the 
basis ofa 3-1 head-to-head record 
in regular season play. CSUSB is 
ranked sixth in the nation. 

Nationals This Weekend for W.W. Polo 
Junior Rick Rupkey (1 0-4), the 

team leader with an ERA of 1.65 
over 109 innings will pitch the 
first game of Saturday's double-
header, withjunior Mike Morgan 
scheduled to throw the nightcap. 

The winner of the Western 
Regional will advance to the six-
team College World Series, to be 
held June I through June 4 on 
Muzzy Field at Eastern Connec-
ticut State University in Brislol, 
Connecticut. By BRIAN /TOW 

Contributing Sports Editor 

The Tritons are on a mission. 
They are out to regain the title 
they held in 1987 but lost a year 
ago to a st"ar-studded UC Davis 
squad. 

The women's water polo team 
will attempt to take the 1989 title 
this weekend at the National 
Tournl!ment in Santa Barbara. 

UCSD enters the tourney as 
the top seed in a seven-team field . 
The team will be grouped with 
Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and 
Slippery Rock Unive rsity, The 
other group will be composed of 
second-seeded UC Davis, third-
seeded UC Santa Barbara, UC 
Berkeley, and UC Irvine. 

The top two teams from each 
group advance to the tournament 
semifinals. The fi rst place team in 
each bracket faced the ~econd 
place quad, with the win ners 
advancing to the championship 
game. 

UCSD should have an easy 
walk into the semifinal game. It 
needs only o ne win in the prelimi-
naries to advance, and has little 

competition. 
The Tritons open Friday against 

Cal Poly SLO and have already 
blown out the Mustanges twice 
this year (15-3 and 20-2). Satur-
day morning they will face Slip-
pery Rock, and Easl Coast school 
that has had little competition in 
the sport. 

The Tritons' competition in'the 
semifi nals and the finals should 
come from UC Davis and UC 
Sa nta Barbara. Both teams are 
very talented and should breeze 
through the rest of their prelimi-
nary competition. 

The Tritons, led by goalie Jefi 
Paulsen, Kristen Larson, Carin 
Crawford, Brenda Reiton , and 
Jamie Dailey, are a well-balanced 
cl ub whose discipline and organi-
zation have helped put them in 
position to recapture their crown. 

Defending National Champion 
UC Davis lost two of the National 
Team players that led the team a 
year ago. The Aggies now rely 
almost solely on National Team 
goalie Nancy Corperstein. 

UCSD Head Coach Denny 
Harper expects to meet UCS B In 
the final game. 

"Both teams are good, but 

UCS B is playing at home," he 
said. "We are looking forward 10 
playing them again." 

The Tritons have beaten UCSB 
in two phy ical matches. The 
Gauchos forfeited an anticipated 
third match earlier this month at 
a tournament in Berkeley. 

Men's Crew Sinks

The UCSD men's crew

up its season last weekend 
with a not-so-impressive

PHIL'S ANALYSIS .. . A betting line ona gambler? 
Anything's possible. I think it's pretty clear by now 
that Pete Rose, the all-time hit leader and current 
manager of the Cincinnati Reds, will get busted for 
something - be it a one-year suspension for betting 

, on baseball in general or a lifetime suspension for 
betting on one of his own team's games, Hey, us 
gamblers are pretty damn stupid, but we're not stupid 
enough to bet for our own teams. Besides, the Reds 
have been muddled in mediocrity for years now. It's 
possible that he bet against the Reds , which is cer-
tainly more practical as far as money is concerned. 
But it'll probably take them too long to prove him 
guilty of betting against his own team during a game 
that he was managing. So they'l settle for the one-year 
suspension, which is mild compared to what could 
happen to him. Either way, though, Phil says he's 
gonna get. "

The hoops were lowered to 9'3", 
and all day the play was elevated 
to new helghlS. One unbelievable 
slam after another shook the 
backboards. ThiS format IS ob-
viously a popular one as the 
number of teams entered nearly 
doubled from the previous high. 
In all 24 teams entered Ihls Slam 
Dunkilthon and waded their way 
through the double elimination 
tournament. 

When the pounding was all 
over, and everyone thoroughly 
brUised and ballered, the defend· 
Ing champs lock-to-Ioek-to-
Ioc:Ic emerged Victorious. They 
cruised eaSily Ihrough the entire 
field wlthoul being pushed to their 
limit. Even In the championship 
game they eaSily handled Old 
FarIs, The outside shooting of 
Andy Wagstaff and Tim Rupp 
proved too much for the defen-
sive efforts of the tired runners -
up. BBB was loaded with talent 
and eaSily the class of the tour -
nament field. The Old Farts pul up 
a good fight, but failed to provide 
serious compelltion and pooped 
out by the end of the long day.

The fans milling about the en-
trance doors of the Worner Oros. 
business office remind me of 
the pubescent female reaction 
towards another pop bond 
whose reign ended by the mid· 
e ighties. The only difference 
between the "Durannies" and 
these kids is that "Duronnies" 
favored fedoras while these 
seem to hove a penchant for the 
color black. 

In a recent interview, Martin 
Gore, musician/lyricist for De-
peche M.ode, explained, "Hov-
ing fans turning up and hanging 
around, rhey aren't really a has-
sle. Hoving said that, I'm going to 
get shot on the way back [to the 
hotel ]." 

"We g ive as much as we can, 
with our music," sinqer David 
Gahan said. "We're j ust not the 
type of band that can really 
handle that [hysteria ] sorT of 
thing. You know, you get up in 
the morning, look in the mirror 
and just think, 'No: You take a 
shower and everything's beITer, 
then you look in the mirror and 
still think, 'No.' It's a bit hard to 
understand why sameone could 
be so obsessed byyou. lt'sreally 
nice and everything, but we're 
just a bond." 

Ah, the pitfalls of being a pap 
star. Not a bod job if you can get 
it. With the release of the movie 
Oepeche Mode: 101 and irs 
accompanying live album, De-
peche Mode may finally be on 
their wGf to grasping the brass 
ring of commercial success. Yet 
fcx almost a decade, the bond 
has had to overcome a bumpy 
rood in order to reach their cur-
rent position. 

The quartet from I3osJldon, 
England, originally consisted of 
Gore, Gahan, songwriter Vincent 
Clarke and musician Ardrew 
Retcher. German bonds such as 

Kraffw~ and Tangerine Dream 
influenced the bond to buy a 
synthesizer and experiment with 
irs electronic options. 

"'We had one synthesizer in 
the bond," Gore explained, "and 
just one bass guitar and one 
rhythm guitar. And we sorT of 
realized thot the alTenrion to the 
synthesizer was greater rhan thot 
of the guitars, so we all bought 
synthesizers and changed into 
an elearonic bond." 

The bond entered the London 

club scene and began distribut-
ing demo topes. Their first con-
lToowas offered by Daniel Miller. 
founder of M.Jre Records. after 
he scrw the bond open for Fad 
Gadget. After the 1981 Mute 
release of Speak and Spell, 
Clarke formed Yozoo with Alison 
Mayet, leaving Depeche Mode 
with both an empty slot and on 
inferiority complex. 

''We had something to prove 
to ourselves," Gore sighed. "As 
soon as Vince left, we got Alan 
[Wilder] In. But for the first year or 
so, he just played live with us and 
wasn't a full member of the 
bond until early '8J. We just 
didn't wont the press to say we'd 
just roped in a musician to make 
things easier after Vince left," 

Ouilding a solid following in 
Europe, the bond discovered 
American aitics and audiences 
to be inhospitable to their mode 
of music. After plGfing a couple 
of New York club gigs in 1982, 
they nied again in 198J. 

"We did a small concert tour of 
just major cities and thot totally 
depressed us," Gore reminisced, 
rocking slowty bock and forth in 
his chair. "We sort of vowed not 
to come back to America. So we 
gave it a miss for about two 
years. We thought that our music 
just really wasn't suited for Amer-
ica. We used to get quite a lot of 
flak for what we were doing, 
being an elecrronic bond. It was 
like hilTing our heads against a 
wall; we thought we might as 
well just not bother." 

In 1984, with the release of 
Some Great Reword, Depeche 
Mode began to accumulate a 
following among larger Ameri-
can cities. Although some of their 
prior curs were papular on the 
dance charts, it was only after 
releasing the single "People /Ve 
People" that the quartet gained 
access to the radio airwaves. 

"I think [we are successful] 
because of this kind of 'cult' 
image," Gore said. "I think thot 
a lot of the time we man-
age to get around by word af 
mouth . .. people like thor ap-
peal, thot they're into something 
befcxe it's really broken, That 
they're doing something our af 
the ordinary." 

Yet their gadual success seems 
to boffle aitics. ~enlly describ-
ed by Rolling Stone as the 
"cyborgs of synth-pop," the 
American press constanlly classi· 
fies Depeche Mode's sryte as 

dreary, synthetic lTosh, much to 
tfie bond's irritation. 

"I think the press labels us," 
Gore said. "I mean, we toke our 
music very seriously. I think they 
just take all the gloomy ele-
menrs from our music and try to 
make a photo-fit person .... In 
some ways, image really isn't 
that imporTant. In some ways, I 
quite like the fact thot people 
think of us as really gloomy, It's 
funny." 

Depends on your sense of 
humor. In a biting , sarcastic way, 
the bond is fairly winy. 

"A lot of people don't get the 
humor from our music, so we do 
try to do it in different ways," 
Gore explained, rolling his eyes. 
"The title for the album, Music for 
the Mosses, we thought was 
really funny, but a lot of people 
didn't find thot funny at all . 

"Uke for the promo clip," Gore 
laughed, "for the 'Everything 
Counrs' live single. In Europe, 
there was an extract from the 
film in the beginning, of the 
accountant saying, 'We made 
loads of money, tons of money: 
But the American record com-
pany thought it was unsuitable 
for America, so they mode us 
edit it off. They couldn't get the 
irony, the sorcasm, the humor of 
it." 

Using music as a means of 
expression. Depeche /IIode has 
cultivated a sound that many try 
to imitate. Known for bashing 
things on the street and record-
ing the consequences, they have 
used absclXe objects to aeate 
samples: everything from peb-
bles on a can to toy instrumenrs. 
Although each member builds 
his awn "library" of sounds, the 
bond often improvises in the 
studiO. By aligning with original· 
iry and avoiding factory presers, 
they have escaped the prob-
lems to which many electroniC 
bonds succumb. 

"If there's a specific ideo thot 
we know we want, we might be 
able to get it from a sound 
eftecrs record," Gore said, run-
ning fiflger5 through his closely 
cropped CI.K1s. 

. 'We' II go to record shops and 
buy tons of sound eftecrs records 
and get them back ta the studio 
and see what they sound like .... 
We try not to toke things from 
really abvious sources. We might 
sample from ethnic records and 
blues records, not necessarily 
really contemporary records." 

, (I 
I, "l, t' ~ H 1 l, • 

Lyrically, Depeche Mode has 
always been I~nown, albeit re-
luctantly, fcx songs thot force 
people to question a particular 
subject or the world in general. 
With the recent re-release of 
"Everything Counrs," a cleverly 
mixed rune depicting a story of 
greed. Gore portrays the '80s 
menrality. The only single to be 
releasecloff 101, Gahan explain-
ed that when Gore wrote "Every-
thing Counts, " "there were a lot 
of legal things going on and 
Martin [Gore] suddenly became 
really aware of all rhese big bus· 
iness things and the fact thor the 
music business itself is such a big 
corporation. He thinks of things 
like that, and then he wanrs to 
put it down." 

As a whole, the live album is 
retrospective of their work over 
the post 10 years. Accompany-
ing the album is a fearure length 
film based on the bond's 1988 
Music For the Masses tour. 

Fearuring songs such as "Just 
Can't Get Enough," "Everything 
Counts: ' and "SlTangelove," their 
geomelTical stage sets are mod-
elled after Leni Reifenstahl's 
designs for the '.36 Munich Olym-
pics. 

Directed by DA Penneboker, 
Chris Hegedus and David Dcr.v-
kins, the low budget film doesn't 
try to portray the bond as huge 
rock stars living in the lap of lux-
ury. It's a serious business, w ith 
corporate jets, business meerings 
between bond representatives 
and executive types, and regu-
lar reports following the vorious 
cosrs of financing a concert tOlX. 

A subplot concerning eight 
young fans winds itself through 
live concert footage. A Long 
Island radio station sponsored a 
contest at Malibu Disco, with the 
winners receMng a aoss-counny 
bus trip, stopping at various 
Depeche Mode concerts along 
the way. A aoss between the 
Brody Bunch and The Young 
Ones, the kids represent the epi-
tome of today's youth culnxe: 
interested in fashion, yet bored 
with such tedious subjects as pop 
history. Pennebaker and Hege-
dus filmed the nip, capturing 
such humorous scenes as rwo of 
the boys posing os members of 
Depeche Mode to palTons at a 
truck stop. 

"It's been quite a long time 
now since we've hod a kind of 
documentary about live per-
formance, " Gore explained . 

"The last one come out in 1984, 
which was recorded in Hamburg, 
in Germany .... We felt thor it 
wasn't really right for us just to use 
the standard contemporary film-

mal~er becouse the sort of resulr 
you end up with is a very stand-
ard film, the sort of film thot could 
be done by anybody. 

"There are a lot of bonds that 
record their concerts and the 
resulrs are quite often the same 
these days because there are a 
lot of filmmakers that have cer-
tain preconceptions. So we 
thought that someone like Pen-
nebokerwould be a good idea." 

Working with Pennebaker, 
Gore claimed. "was quite noru-
ral. He'd be walking around with 
a camero on his shoulder and 
you'd never know when it was 
on or off, he'd just be talking to 
you." 

Initially designed to be a cross-
promotional video, the bond 
decided to release it onto the 
big screen for a limited run. 
Although they have no illusions 
of 101 becoming a box-office 
hit, the rationale was "If we can, 
why not?" 

The film concludes with the 
bond's 101 st performance at the 
Los Angeles Rose Oowf. Yet De-
pecheMOOedoesn'thove heady 
aspirations of commercial dom-
ination. 

' 'We don't wont to pretend 
thor suddenly, now thot we've 
done a stadium gig, we're a sto-
dium bond," Gahan sneered. 

~'That's rubbish. We don't want to 
run before we can walk property 
.. .. These people have been 
coming up to me and saying. 
'We'd like to offer you this script. 
for a film' and stuff. It's really 
weird. I mean, fucking hell, I'm 
not on actor, you know. I just 
make music. I just sing in a bond 
and I do the best I can." 

Wesrwood One !\odio Net-
works and R & R (!\odio and

Helicopter's managt'r, Brent Stick-

drives me to their rehearsal space 
in Coronado for the interview. 
On the way upstairs, I'm a little 
surprised to meet John's mom and 
his dog, Pal. 

In his bedroom, equip-
ment is overflowing, an 
overwhelming feeling of H I· ter ~ k O..u 
happiness and closeness, e lCOP a es 

~}tb:nd~~fiil::h:t r~~~ot 
All of the mt'mbers are UCSD students. John Vernetti and Jim Stanley have been playing together since 

high school, and Dave Hepler joined the duo in February of last year . John and Dave were in a required 
writing class together, and one day John asked Dave to sing in the band. At the beginning, there was another 
drummer, Alex Virtue, who has since moved to England. Now it's a trio,lohn on bass,Jim on guitar, Dave 
on drums, and all three sin~in~. 

I think about that tight room they' re rehearSing in, and I know if they weren't such close friend~, they 
would all go crazy in there. John'S acting pretty corny, he says he stayed up all night philosophizing. He's 
making inside jokes which the other guys insist are not inside. Nobody understands them. 

The music, they say, is collaborative. Whoever comes up with the concept writes the lyrics, and Jim 
writes most of the music. I ask about the lyrics which have a lot to do with findingoneselfin this world. Jim 
says they try not to preach to people, they would rather write about themselves, and let people figure it out 
for themselves. 

The band doesn't enjoy discussing their music because it tends to speak for itself. The richly layered 
sound is filled with jazz/fusion, DC Hardcore, classic rock, and various other influences. 

They seem much more interested in talking and joking about one another . They don't take themselves 
too seriously . They admit that the way they come across in person is a lot different from their musical 
presence. Watching them rehearse, the intensity and drive they possess is clearly evident. The lyrics are also 
profound; there are no jokes there. 

I can't help wondering if they hadn't planned this interview for a specific time, as an army helicopter flies 
over the beach, drowning out our voices and forcing us to watch in silence for a few seconds. 

It's a sign, they all agree. 
The band is currently in the process of looking for a label, any label, they say. They have two tapes out, 

unfortunately of very poor sound quality. In addition, they are included on a local bands' compilation tape 
put out by KSDT. The live show is a definite must-see. They are playing this Friday at 10 p.m., downstairs at 
SOMA, 555 Union St., 18 and up, for $5 .

Looting the White House 
by laura baker 

hiatus writer 

One o f the ironies of sociall y conscious music is that the kinds 
o f people it's meant to enlighten don't listen to it (just try and 
picture Bush rocking o ut to the Clash). 

Take, fo r instance, the Sa n Francisco based band the Looters. 
U nless you caught their performance at the Bell y Up last week, or 
you've lived in the Bay Area, you probably haven't heard ofthem. 
Their compelling sound and lyrics are worth tracking down their 
album Flashpoint in the record store. 

Theirs is a sound of surprise . C ritics have come up with a 
variety of definitions for their music: "raw, soulful funk ," " hot 
funk and reggae," "salsa, African, punk and psychedelic." Most 
simply identify them as "world beat greats." The strength of their 
music comes from this chameleon-like quality, with its rhythmic 
five-voice singing. 

Although their sound is appealing in itself, it ', therr lyrics that 
have attracted the most attention. On Flashpoinc, the song "Man-
zanar" takes its name from the World War II Japanese relocation 
camp . .. Attitude" is a humorous piece of social criticism, while 
"Outrage" is somewhat more serious. 

The band has been playing together since 1981 and in 1986 
released an EP on Jello Biafra's Alceroocive Tentacles. The band's 
aggressive music and their unwillingness to compromise kept 
major recording labels away until Island Records signed them on 
last year. 

"You've got to be true to yourself and express what's inside," 
stated the band's leader, Mat Callahan. "If you approach music as 
a commercial venture, it is, at best, a crap shoot and, at worst, a 
trap. That's the original intention of music - to express yourself 
- and living in this world, you can't turn off what's happening or 
avoid talking about that." 

They deliberately mix their music from a vast array of different 
sources to make a point. "That's a common thread through the 
history of the band, that we incorporate things we like consciously, 
in spite of the divisions in the record store," Callahan explained. 

"Those categories and markets make a stifling atmosphere. 
That's just demographics done by someone in an office with 
nothing to do with music other than to make money from it, a 
conservatism and isolation that separates people from each other. 
We've deliberately chosen to skate across those borders and that 
gives us the greatest freedom. " 

I've already mailed a cassette tape to the White House.

Deep in the Heart of Bohemia 
by donovan p. roche 

a si tant art editor 

Their music has been de 'ribed as 
"free- pirited," "starkly poeti ," 
"impre ionistic" and even "nou-
veau quirk." In fa t, there isn't 
much that hasn't been aid about 
Edie Brickell and New Bohemians. 

While their impre ive debut, 
hoot ing Rubberbands At The tars, 

approaches d ubiI.' platinum ta-
tus (two milli n copies old), rit-
ics continue to search for an 
appropriate phra e to de cribe 
their, for la k of a better term, 
"bohemian" approach to music. 

"All of u have tremendou Iy 
varied influence ," B ehemian 
basslst Brad Hou er aid. "Edie ha 
been really into Bob Marley for 
awhile - we don't do reggae but I 
think he gets influenced by ju t 
the ound and the feel."

p.m. Fright Night Takes Flight 

by isabelle tihanyi 
hiatua senior staff writer 

If you enjoy your horror movies a bit rare with a exy sauce and a 
humorous sprinkle of blood, garli ,and holy water, than Fright Night-
Part II is a flick worth biting into. It's got it all - romance, intrigue, 
androgynous vampire , and plastic fangs. 

The tone varie from super silly to somewhat predictable. However, 
there are hotspots which really tand out and make this movie fun to 
watch. One is a en uous scene with the deadly vamp from hell, Regine 
(Carmen Dandridge). She take over a TV horror sh who ted by Peter 
Vin ent, Fearless Vampire Killcr (R ddy McDowell) and performs an 
evil dance which isn't to scary but very well horeographed and hot. 

Another highlight i part of the climax () it remains to be een ... (ju t 
a hInt: it involve jell ). 

Roddy M Dowell de ribes hi chara ter , Vincent, as a terrible 
oward with a good nature. " He' capable f bravery when things get 

bad." Although the character wa 
predictable, with no real meta-
morphosis, McDowell' perform-
ance was believable.

$50,788. Not bad for a relatively 
unpublicized concert flick, whi h 
are generally notorious box office 
flop. 

The limiteJ publi ity tactic was 
partially the band's idea. "I think 
that to do it in this way i very sort 
of low key," Gore aid. "It's a 
better way to do it. If for some 
reason it d es well, pcople are 
pleasantly surprised. If not, then it 
can just come out on video and 
nothing'S lost. It 's o.k. 

"I think the way U2 went about 
it [with Rattle and Hum] wa a bit 
of a mistake in some ways. They 
had this massive promotional bud-
get. They just went out and there 
were big adverts everywhere and 
then everyone was just let down at 
the end of that. Everybody ex-
pected thi massive box office 
thing and it didn't happen." 

Between the live album, concert 
film, and cult status, many have 
made omparisons between U2 
and Depe he Mode. "The movie 
thing was ju t really unfortunate," 
Gore laughed. "We had been plan-
ning our film for about a year 
before it actually came out. We 
were totally unaware of what the 
U2 amp was doing. We just 
found out at a late stage that their 
film was cuming out a couple of 
months before ours. 

"U2 was in a similar situation 
as us in '85," Gore said, after 
pausing to contemplate the idea. 
"People are trying to convince 
other people that we' re about to 
brt!ak really big. T hey like to make 
that omparison, though it's un-
important to us." 

Depeche Mode: 101 is scheduled 
to be released in San Diego June 2. 
C urrently worki ng on an upcom-
ing album in Milan, the band has 
tt!ntativeiy set tour date begin-
ning in early 1990. 

"1990 is going to be the year of 
the Mode," crowed Gahan, dur-
ing a recent radio interview. It wi ll 
be interesting to ee if the band
