Controlled 
danger: 
a paradox 
in isotope 
lab work 

By TEVEN CHA IKI N 
Health and afety techni-

cian Steven Bold talk easily 
as he cuts open th next box 
and lift out the blue pIa tic 
jar. In ide a ventilation hood 
he aw apart the blue jar. 
Then he lift out a small glass 
bottle - t he size of a drugstore 
iodine bottle - and, behind a 
mall fort res of lead bricks, 

he checks it for radiatIOn 
leaks. 

Today is Thursday, a 
package day at UCSD's 
Environmental Health and 
Radiation Safety Lab. More 
than a core of i otope 
packages have arrived. Each 
week 50 to 70 package are 
dropped off in th cramped 
room near the center of 
campus and each is meticu-
lously examined. If they are 
not 'hot.' or radioa tive, the 
small bott les are repackaged 
and delivered to their 
respective labs. If they are, 
the) are ent back to the 
manufacturer.

Letter to the Editor 

There are few people that I 
know who would di agree 
with the statement that the 
University of California is one 
of the finest educational 
institutions in the world. The 
UC system regularly has more 
faculty members nominated to 
pre ligiou s scientific and 
technical societies, con istent· 
Iy makes news by being on the 
cutting edge of research and 
technology, and of course 
produces some of the mo. t 
highly trained and finely 
educated graduate in thi 
country. Look also, if you will, 
at the amounts of money that 
the UC system regularl y 
draws in the form of grants, 
contract, and gift. Ye , for 
those fev. amongst uc; who 
may not know, the UC 'y tem 
in general, and UC D in 
particular, are recognized 
through the world as a mexiel 
of educational excellence. 

indication of just how much 
the Governor, the Legislature. 
and the Regents appreciate 
their efforts. Ye. it true, 
University employees will be 
lucky toget a 2.5 percent cost of 
living adjustment thIS year. 
Think of it. Aren't you just 
brimming over with heartfelt 
thank? Why 2.5 percent may 
even put you in a new tax 
bracket! It certainly won't 
tempt you to go Ollt and spend 
your money foolishly on such 
luxuries as meat, or one night 
out per month. or other such 
nonsense. 

A big list of several reasons 
why fat is good for America 

And who keeps it going? 
Good old working people, the 
average joe and mary on the 
street. Their taxes built the 'e 
edifice around us. Their taxes 
keep them clean and under 
relat ively good repaIr. Their 
federal taxes help upport the 
research here. And then. of 
course, there is the University 
labor force. who do all the 
things physical and mental to 
keep the elaborate wheel 
turning. and by their actions 
keep the professors teaching. 
the researchers exploring and 
discovering. and the students 
graduating. The simple, hard· 
working laborer. white· and 
blue-collar: they keep this 
place going. and going strong. 

Well. those hard·working 
University employees are 
about to receive a true 

The Bottom Line 

Yes, University employees 
should be awfully thankful 
that the powers that be have 
d cidedtoble<;slhemwiththi 
increase. The, powers are all . 
I am sure , God ·fearing 
Chnsllan .. and they knc)\\ as 
we all do t hat monel' is I he root 
of all evil. The, '. In their 
benevolent desp()t Ism. are 
'urely attempting to keep 
workers as far away from evil 
as possible. urely they 
deserve something for that. 
Perhaps they too should get a 
2.5 percent of living 
adjustment. Or better, why 
don't Californians demand 
that their elected official 
receive the same wages that 
the average worker in 
California receives? 

Then the! too can revel in 
the beauty of the simple life, 
with simple meals, simple 
clothes. simple housing, and 
simple interest on their 
aving. I could think of no 

bet ter way to show our 
officials how much they are 
appreciated than to give them 
exactly what t hey have given 
all the worker in the state-
nothing.

Bruce Macdonald' May 10 

column, "Let's face it: fat 
people have no rea on to live," 
scared me. Just think for a 
minute about a world without 
any excessively large bodies in 
it. ociety as we know it would 
probably cease to function . 
Sure. [he pict ure might be 
prettier, but so much could go 
wrong. 

Consider, for example. the 
nation 's economy. If, as 
Macdonald suggests, every fat 
per on were to "eat les ." the 
farm belt would go under In no 
time. Nabi 'co, Pilsbury, Frito· 
Lay and Hostess wou Id soon be 
knocking on the government's 
door asking for handouts. 
After all, remember what 
happened to Chrysler when we 
were a ked to save gas. Think 
of the severe beating the local 
ice·cream parlours and 
chocolate-chip cookie bakeries 
would take. The sma ll (no 
comparison intended) eatery 
owners could well be wiped 
out. Besides this, the figure 
salon and fat camp business 
failures would put thousands 
out of work, and what wedon't 
need is more unemployment. 
(Although I suppose starving 
unemployed people do eat 
less). 

Something else to consider: 
where would we park for the 

Loma Theater if Eagle on 's 
went bankrupt? The only 
people who would benefit are 
those psychotic diet book 
writers and the Florida Citrus 
Growers Association. Grape· 
fruit would be a way of life. 
Ugh. With theeconomicfabric 
(call it stretch·knIt polyester) 
In ~llch bad shape now, if over 
half the count ry ate les ·. we'll 
be in size 22 trouble. On the 
ot her hand, we can alwavs 
hope the extra food money 
would go to buy T-bills or 
Chrvsler stock. 

'50- inch hips are a 
necessity for the 
health of America.' 

But even beyond the 
practical problems, there is a 
psychological phenomenon to 
be examined here. 50·inch hips 
are a vital necessity for the 
mental health of America. 
Chemically speaking. the 
heavier elements in our society 
keep the egos of the lighter 
ones happy. Dear Abby mi~ht 
want to send the "fattie ' to 
Bellrose, New York, but what 
wou ld happen if we couldn't 
watch 310 Ibs. of cellulite 

walking down the beach and 
sigh with relief? Imagine not 
being able to console ourselves 
with the thought that we look 
ten times better in shorts than 
Kate Smith. We'd wind up 
wit h a coutry fu II of paranoid 
si7c 12's being laughed OUI of 
town by t he size '. nd let \ 
not forget those SItuations 
when we want to impres~ 
others with our wit. We won't 
b able to tell fat jokes 
anymore. Try laughIng about 
Bertha. the 121·lb. \'egetarian. 

And just think of the kids. 
Let's face it: Santa Claus is fat. 
Do you want to tell your child 
that Santa is a disgusting 
sloth? I can't imagine anything 
worse than leaving skim mIlk 
and dry toast out for an old 
man with an 32·inch waist. I 
certainly wouldn't want him 
saying "HO, HO , HO" in my 
fireplace. 

Instead of regarding the 
"full·figured" as "one big 
pain," as Macdonald does. we 
shou ld be thankful. and give 
them jobs where they can be 
respected. like doing restau· 
rant reviews or wine 
commercial . After all, the 
thin among us might be on the 
other end of the popsicle stick 
if Macdonald had been a fat 
satirical columnist instead of 
an overly critical skinny one.

Myopic Monogamy versus the big bad Russians 
By THOMAS RANKIN 

Billy Graham recently took 
a trip to the Soviet Union, 
where he addressed various 
congregations and ru bbed 
shoulders with high ·zoot Sovs. 
He returned with an 
inexplicable enthu iasm for all 
things Soviet, all aglow with 
the discovery that. indeed. 
there are human beings in the 
USSR. 

Thi excitement led to a 
series of hyperbolic press 
conferences that fnghtened 
the ignorant, brought the 
informed to the edge of giddy 
hys tencs and turned the 
JewI~h communIty green and 
black and blue. He started off 
WIth thi s statement at the 
Mosco .... Alq)Ort : "I thInk 
there IS a lot more freedom 
here than ha ... been gIven the 
ImpreSSIOn in the State ... 

because there are hundred . 
thousand of churches open." 

This in itself is an 
innocuous enough statement, 
and also quite facutal, but 
later statements gave the 
erroneous impres ion that the 
Soviets are religiously benign, 
and that Siberian camps 
where Jewish and ot her 
Intellectuals starve and freeze 
to death each year are but bad 
dreams. The e were ludicrous 
statements and they brought 
the freaks out of the woodwork 
before you could say 
"SolIdarity." 

Jerry Falwell , clown pnnce 
of the Moral Majorit y, dldn't 
take any of this sIltIng 
(kneelIng?) down. In a UPI 
releas , he wa~ quoted as 
"aYIng. "I ha\ ' dIfficulty 
believing hI;! (Graham ) said 
It.. .. There IS no religious 

freedom in the Soviet Union. 
"Everything the Soviets do 

is for propaganda purposes .... I 
don't think he- (BG) had any 
wrong intentions whatsoever. 
I think the Soviets had all the 
wrong intention ." 

After this statement was 
released, the ever·watchful 
Guardian contacted yet 
another right ·wing zealot. 
Gary Fireball is t he founder 
and spiritual leader of the 
Myopic Monogamy, a political 
power organization located in 
Arkansal> or Nebraska. 
Fireball considers hi mself an 
expert on Sovlet ·Amencan 
relatIOns, haVIng read every 
issue of Til/II' Magazinl' since 
he firsl got (Jut of the military. 

In a phone Inten'lew last 
' unda\' , FIreball made the 
followi'ng ,tatements: "Good 
AmerIcans have a God given 

duty to hate the Soviets. They 
are less than human. The 
Church of the Righteously 
Indignant has a command· 
ment that states 'Thou shalt 
hate and kill all those whom 
thou dost not understand.' 

" I know for a fact that 
Soviets eat onl y cardboard and 
nuclear waste. They feed their 
children the dried flesh of 
Afghanis and urinate in 
bottles and sell it here as 
vodka. The women there have 
bot h male and female (giggle) 
genitalia and have sex with 
themselves during all those 
Marxist rallies. It's repulsive. 

"There is no real law in the 
USSR. If. for example, you arc 
caught smiling dUrIng 
daylight hours. they pull out 
your fingernaIls and pop your 
eyeballs. Anyone who speaks 
alxlllt humanity there just 

because they saw it first·hand 
must be brainwashed." 

I asked Fireball if these 
statements weren't perhaps a 
bit out of line. comin~ as they 
did from a " religious' leader. 
After all, I pointed out, any 
scripture ever written, 
including the New Testament, 
preaches love and understan· 
ding. 

" It's very dangerous," he 
said. "to believe everything 
you read. If we on ly preached 
the scriptures. verbatim, 
people would get bored and 
play Pac·Man all day . We've 
got a commitment to God to 
jazz the whole deal up a bit. 
Peace, love and happiness 
don ' t have no clout in 
WashIngton. Tears and blood 
are a small price to pay for a 
,Mong, influential rcligiou ~ 
bat klash."

Letter to the Editor 

Getting the facts straight about the Falklands war 
Editor: 

In the past seven weeks, the 
conflict over the Malvina 
Islands (called Falklands by 
the British) has been on the 
front page of every newspaper, 
the first story on every radio 
and TV newscast. By now, 
everybody feels they know 
what's going on: the motives, 
the sense and the nonsense of 
it all. The message has been 
clear and consistent: here is a 
banana republic. whose ruling 
junta is st irring up troubl~ by 
invading British islands, 
claiming them because of their 
geographical proximity, with 
the purpose of distracting the 
people from the country's 
internal problems so they 
won't revolt (we are provided 
with a simple explanation). 
Their claims of sovereignty 
lack all substance since the 
British have held the island 
for the last 149 years (we are 
told nothing about the 
previous history of the islands. 
which eems to be irrelevant). 
If they had any claims, they 
s hould have defended them be 
diplomatic means (we are led 
to believe they haven't really 
done so). Finally, for doing 
s uch a fooli h thing. they are 
going to be rightfully punished 
(armed aggressions cannot be 
allowed to ucceed, justice 
must be upheld! 0 feelings of 
unfairness about what i going 
to happen should disturb our 
sleep). 

Is this the real story. the 
whole story? o. it' not even 

half ot it. What we're being fed 
in the media is a basically pro· 
British collection of selected 
facts and interpretations . 
Mass media is capable of 
shaping public opinion, and 
they are clearly using that 
power here: the American 
public is being clearly cheated 
out of the knowledge of a major 
part of the political and 
historical facts, precisely the 
ones that support and 
substantiate the Argentine 
claim to the ic;lands. Without 

'The American public 
is being cheated out 
of the facts .... ' 

this knowledge, it's not really 
pos ible to understand , much 
less make judgements about 
the present conflict. 

The main historical points 
upporting Argentine sove· 

reignty over the islands are: 
1) In 1520 they were 

discovered by Esteban Gomez 
and claimed by Spain, 70 year ~ 
before the fir t British sailor 
Gohn Davis) saw them 

2) Bet ween 1667 and 1790 
Great Britain acknowledged 
Spanish so\'ereignt y in 7 
dIfferent treaties. 

3) Starting in 1774, the 
SpanIards placed I he Is lands 
under the juri diction of 
Buenos Aires. A conrinuous 
succes ion of 19 governors 

Robert Caldwell 
editorial writer for the 

San Diego Union 

and 

wa maintained to adminis ter 
the settlements there. 

4) [n 1816 Spain recognized 
the Malvina as an integral 
part of th newly independent 
Republic of Argentina, which 
established permanent 
settlement and named 5 more 
governors until the British 
invasion of 1833. 

5) In 1825, in the first trade 
and navigation treaty signed 
with Argentina, Britain made 
no mention of any claim to the 
islands. 

6) In 1829 the Briti h 
Foreign Office sent an official 
note to Bueno Aire saying, 
among other things, that it 
would be "highly desirable" 
for them to have a safe port 
available in the South Atlantic 
for their ships en route to the 
Pacific. . 

7) In 1833 this mterest 
turned into action when the 
forces lead by British Captain 
Onslow invaded the Malvinas, 
expelling all of the Argentine 
population wtth t o tal 
di regard of their right . 

The se ar e th e m ost

that substantiate ArgentIne 
, overeignty 0\ er the islands 
and the illegI tImacy of theIr 
occupatIOn by the BntIsh

A common in tentIon IS that 
thIS is old history. so th(' 

Statute of Limitations should 
apply and the islands should 
remain in British hands. Thi 
would be a legitimate point if 
Argentina had remained s ilent 
for ]49 years, but thi s is not 
the case: continuous prote ts 
were filed every single year, in 
an at tempt to get the i lands 
back by diplomatic means 
rather than by force. It's al so 
obvious that at the time a 
young country like Argentina 
didn't have the strength to 
oppose armed resistance to the

trash cans, and cabinets. 

Howeve r , sometimes 
probl ems do develop. 

In the past year there have 
been a few incidents which 
were important enough to 
concern the state, says Ben 
Kapel of the state Department 

Both Jisha and Rae 
agree there are work-
ers who ignore radia-
tion regulations. 

of Health Sfrvice , Radiologic 
Health Branch. 

Some labs were not checked 
often enough while a few other 
labs were found to have some 
contamination. Two months 
ago some phosphorou ·32 was 
spi lled when it was being 
packed for disposal. 

Kapel wi ll not detail these 
incidents, but he maintains 
that they were not serious. 
"This is normal when you 
have 400 lab going at once," 
he says. "[t' not unlike many 

Branden 
to speak 
on Rand 

athaniel Branden, founder 
and former executive director 
for] J years of the Nathaniel 
Branden Institute in New 
York City, will speak on 
campus tomorrow, addressi ng 
"The Benefi ts and Hazards of 
the Philo ophy of Ayn Rand." 

Branden, best known for hi 
I8·year a, sociat ion with the 
late novelist and philosopher 
Rand , is peaking for the fir st 
time since Rand' death in 
March of this year. 

Rand i best know for her 
books, The Foul/tainhead, and 
AlIas Shrugged. Both novels 
advocate her philosophy of 
objectivism, or ratIOnal self· 
Interest and indI vidual 
determinalion. 

Br ande n will be at

p.m . on Tuesday, May 25. 

campuses." The problem, 
Kapel says, was a lack of 
training of users and an 
overworked radiation afety 
staff. 

Ji ha, who formerly worked 
fo r the state and trained Kapel, 
is constituting a program to 
correct t hese and other 
deficiencie . Another health 
and safety officer will be hired 
and radiation training, which 
was avai lable on a volunteer 
ba is, wi ll now be mandatory 
for all researchers . 

Bold, Jisha and Alfred Rae, 
the director of the health and 
safety department, all agree 
that there are people who are 
probably ignoring radiation 
regulation or are unaware of 
them. 

We get "good cooperation 
most of the time," say Bold, 
but he "wouldn 't di s pute 
radiation s loppiness m the 
labs .' 

Some isotope u se r s 
"con cientiously pour their 
isotopes into the proper 
container then , without 
thinking, wash untensils in 
the si nk ," ays Bold . 

Rae puts some of the blame 
of lab contamination on 
"cookbook re earchers who 
follow what the guy did before 
them" in tead of learning the 
proper procedures. 

Typical contamination 10 
the labs is sloppiness. Because 
radiation can't be seen - or 
felt - researchers may forget 
about the mall amounts 
which run down the side of the 
fla k, and that all the utens ils 
which come in contact with a 
radioactive source become 
contaminated. At least two hot 
cent rifuges have been found . 
Again, careles ness is at fault. 
Becau e of the different decay 
rates of isotopes, health and 
safety a ks the lab to 'eparate 
the different elements. But 
omettmes, this procedure is 

forgotten . 
When asked whv more 

people do not attend the 
voluntary t ad iation safety 
classes, to co rrect these 
problems, Rae says "that's 
\I hat t hey ca II academ IC 
freedom. H-e (t he researcher) 
looks at it (hi s re. earch) as a 
very private th ing."

mo s tly ca rbon · 14 and 
phosphorus·32. 

"People in the lab don 't like 
to have interference from 
outside agen cies," says 
Howell. " [t' s like a bank when 
the auditors come in . 

"If I felt it repre ented a 
danger, obviously I'd get rid of 
it. But orne things are tidiness 
issues. [t' s something that you 
don't attend to on a day today 
basis. 

"Most stuff is such low 
radioactivity that it's not even 
worth di posing of This is 
only tracer experimental use," 
ays Howell. 

"The potential doe exist for 
hazardous situations, that 's 
why we have regulations," 
says Howell. Bul "we work 
with a 101 of hazardous 
materials In blOlogy·poisons. 
inhibitors, so forth, and 
radioactive materIals are just 
one of those." 

Environmental health and 
safet y officials do have a hard 
job, admIts Howell. "They get 
flak from both ends. It's better 
to err on t he side of safety than 
err on hazard," he says. 

Dr. John Holland. who 'ay~ 
he is "probably the largest 
user on campus, calls the 
health and safety people 
"ext remely thorough." and 
s ays "you ca n 't be too 
cautiou ."

coni amen, (carboys) and row~ 
of gla . ware which were left LO 
radioactively burn out. He 
s ay s " ga so line ' talion 
attendants breathing gasoline, 
that 's a hazard ." 

*** 
Once isotopes ha\'e been 

pa ssed through gels and 
separation columns, health 
and safety come and picks up 
the waste. All chemical and 
radioactive debris are trucked 
to the schoof's dump sill' on 
Old Miramar Road .

Here the hoI \13b and tubes

Radi oact Ive ca rcasses are

dIsposed of separately. 

Each barrel contaln~ a 
single kind of isotope. Becau,>e 
isotopes decay at different 
rates, the school can let some

Phosphorous·32, for example, 
because of its 14·day half·life. 
i allowed to SIt for 140 days. 
Isotope like galium·67 and 
iodine·I31 must sit for almost 
two years before they are safe. 

At the end of the wan, each 
barrel is opened and safet) 
workers check to make ~ure 
that the I otopes are Indeed

barrel · may be "ent to a local

Proposal \Vould give students' natnes to 
continue d from page 5 
year which would have 
granted military recruiters 
acce s to confidential st udent 
records to facilitate theIr 
informat IOn gat hering. 

Recruiters would use the 
directory information to 
conduct telephone and mail 
campaign to enlist students 
into the armed forces. 

Schmitz failed to appear at a 
recent committee hearing to 
advocate his measure, but 
instead sent three military 
officers to testIfy . . 

Maj. James Mckelligan, 
co mmanding officer of 

acramento's U Marine 
Corps recruiting station, told 
the committee his office often 
encounters difficulties with 
individual schools and 
districts which refuse to 
cooperate \\ ith them. 

"Requiring them to furnish 

lists wtll help recruiters 
ensure an alkoluntarv force. 
which would help avoid a 
draft." Mckelligan concluded. 

Jerry l'v1atlhews. a Sacra · 
mento·area resident. related to 
the commIttee the story of his 
son, a near·dropout in the 12th 
grade whom mIlitary recrui t· 
ers turned around bv 
convincing him to join the 
Marines after graduatIng from 
high school. 

The commIttee heard a 
barrage of testimony. 
however . opposIng tlie 
measure on ground!> that it 
would restrict pm'at} and 
would remove from local 
control the right to provide or 
wit hhold such lists. 

The bill was tabled for 
further s tudy after Assem· 
blymember Robert aylor (R· 
Menlo Park) complained the 
measure granted t he military 

Beverage industry to 
fight Bottle Bill 

The beverage industry is 
prepared to spend at least $6.3 
million to defeat the 
returnable contamer law on 

ovember's ballot. according 
to a Ralph ader California 
re earch affiliate. 

William K. Shireman, 
research director of the 
California Public Interest 
Research Group (CaIPIRG), 
said the industry 's campaign 
against the Can and Bottle 
Recycling Initiative "may be 
the mo t expensi\'e 'and 
poli hed campaIgn In 
Caltfornia's historv." 

If passed , the 'law would 
requIre that beer and soft· 
drink cans and boltles be 
returnable for a 3·cent depo!'.it 
The measure, modeled after 
Oregon'.; lO·vea r·ol d bot t Ie 
bIll. IS supported b~ 
Californians AgaInst Waste 

(CAW), a coalition of 300 
environmental. consumer, and 
citizen groups. It is opposed by 
major conlainer manufac· 
turer and beer and soft·drink 
producers . 

"The beverage indust ry has 
been fighting depoSIt laws for 
more than a decade, and 
they've developtd a very 

pr~dictable strategy." 
ShIreman ald. 

'The prinCIpal aim is to

For Your Health By Adam Barton Austin 

Propolis: a cure from the past 
Nature has provided bees 

with a substance that keeps 
t hem and t hei r hi\ ~ germ· 
free . This protecti\'e sub 
slance, called pl'vpolis , IS 
placed at the opening of the 
hive to stertlize anything 
ent pn ng It. 

Hm\ ever, bet.'" do not make 
propolls. The) gat her it from 
trees such a..; popl a r, 
horsechestnllt, spruce and 
olher conifer .... Propohs is not a 
'>Ing le compound, but a 
mIxture of many compounds, 
including nutrients and 
antibactenal agents. 

AnCIent Egyptians used 
prop()ll~ as a remedy for slo\\'· 
healing sores and intestmal 
aIlments . Hippocrates. the 
fat her of modern medicme. 
recommended propolis to I he 
Greeks for sores and ulcers. 
Early Roman writers 
descri bed the use of bee 
propolis in writings in the fIrst 
century A.D. 

In the Middle Ages. wnters 
again described health uses uf 
propolis, generally as an 
ointment taken directly from 
trees as opposed to beehives. 
Propolis was used on slow· 
heali ng wounds during the 
South African Boer War (1899) 
and in Ru ia, during the First 
and Second World Wars. 

Interest in propolis had 
lessened since t he advent of 
modern antibacterials such as 
penicillin . But now new 
studies have hown that 
propolis has direct antibacte· 
rial properties, and that 
propolis has been determined 
to have antivira l and 
antifungal pro pert ies . Propolis 
ha also been found to enhance 

the immune re;,ponse of I he 
bod •. 

Ilr. Maxllntllian Kern and 
IJr. M Laker of the the ClInic 
of Lju bljana in Yugusla\'la, 
have reported results for the 
use of propolis agaInst 
InflammatIons of the mucou~ 
nlt'mbranes of the throat and 
mouth, sore throats, tlrv 
coughs and tonsillitis. . 

Dr. Franz K. Feiks of the 
PublIc Hospital at Kloster 
neurlX!rg. AU'-otna, conducted 
a te"t using propolls against 
ulcers. Fifteen ulcer patients 
\\ere treated with com·entio· 
nal drugs . Fourteen of [he 
flft een propol is treated 
pat lents \\ ere cured, while 
onl\ SIX of the convent iOllallv 
treated patients were cured .. 

[n a second test. Dr. Feih 
treated 294 patients hosplta· 
lized with ulcers. NInet\ 
percent of the J08 patien!~ 
given propolis were free of 
symptoms after t\\O weeks. 
Thi:-. compared to only fIfty · 
fIve percent of the I 6 
conventio nally treated 
patients. Dr. Feiks noted that 
eventy percent of the propoli 

group obtained relief in three 
days, while only ten percent of 
the group receiving conven· 
tional medication experienced 
relief in the same period. 

Dr. Edith Lauda, a Soviet 
physician, reported in 1958 
that propolis ointment 
completely healed patients 
with various types of acne. 
One test involved 59 patient 
who had severe acne despite 
several years of antibiotic 
treatment in dermatology 
clinics. Dr. Lauda reported 
that 25 cases were completelv 

healed In one week and the 
remaining 35 ca!'.e!-- wcre 
healed wlthm three w('t'ks. 

[n 19S3, a SO\'iet ph~ siClan. 
Dr . Prokoplvic. determined 
that a quarter of one percellt 
solution of propoll., \\,a,.. three 
limes more effect 1\(' [han a 
corre ... pondlng cocaine 
solution, and more than fift\' 
times as effect 1\(' as a 
novocaine solutIOn. [n 197:3. 
reports from' the Sovi et F n ion 
deSCrIbed a ne\\ anesthet ic 
t hat was a mlxt ure of 
novocaine and propolis. Soviet 
dentists had regularl~' been 
uSing a four percen t prop()lt~ 
solution a" a pain kIller. 

Dr. [zet O;.managic of 
Saraje\(), Yugosla\'lil. tested 

propoli~ against the tlu dunng 
an epidemic. StudIed were 270 
\'oluntet'rs - 88 of them 
taking proJXlitS. Only se\ en 
percent became ill compan.>d to 
sixty·three percent of those 
not takIng propolI". 

According to a relxlrt made 
publtc at an mternational 
medIcal conference In 
Czechoslo\'akia, the many 
health benefits of propolis 
include its ability to stimu late 
the body's immune system. 
Dr. Remy Chauvin of Paris, 
France, s tates: " Propoli 
works by raising the body 's 
natural resi tance to 
infect ions through stimula-
ting one's own immunity 
system." 

Propoli s, like t he many 
other natural elements that 
are currently being intensively 
researched, may be the answer 
to acne, ulcers and sore throats 
as well as other bacterial. viral 
and fungal illnesses.

Both of these artists had a 
great deal to do with the pop 
art movement in the late 50s 
and early 60s. such that the 
films wi ll take an in-dept h look 
at each artist , his work. and 
his impact on the art world . 

In Andy Warhol, Warhol's 
work on both film and canvas 
is di scussed by art world 
personalities, underground

The Falklands warandthepro-British media 
Most of the above mentioned 

facts are of enormou 
importance in the issue. yet 
they have been mo tlyomitted 
by the major newpapers and 
TV networks. Argentine 
groups in California have 
complained that articles. 
embassy release and even 
letters to the editor sent to the 
major newspaper stating the 
missing information have not 
been publi hed , even though 
they were supported by 

Glen and Shearer 

abundant and solid documen· 
tation . 

Everyone has the right to 
their own opinion on any 
is ue, according to their 
personal feelings about 
ju tice, but thi opinion can 
only be properly formed when 
all of the relevant facts are 
known and can be considered. 
In t he US t here is total 
freedom of press, but this 
freedom is by no means a 
guilr,nt I't' of complete and 

object ive information. The sad 
truth is t hat we cannot place 
all our trust in what we read or 
hear in the media, or consider 
it a sufficient basis to envision 
the world and make judge' 
ments. 

The coverage of the 
Malvinas/ Falklands conflict, 
with its pro·British bias and 
selective ommision of relevant 
information, is a clear case of 
manipulation of public 
opinion. R('ariin!,{ the complete 

story of the conflict may 
probably provide us with some 
profound insights, not only 
about the nature of colonial· 
ism, but also that of mass 
media . 

Anyone interested in more 
detailed info about the subject 
is welcome to contact me; I'll 
be glad to provide it my elf or 
direct them to more know· 
ledgeable sou rces if necessary.

continued from page 4 
solved "according to the 
wishes of t he islanders," 
which translates into staging 
a vote to return to British rule. 
The Argentine position is that 
the islanders may become 
Argentine citizens or remain 
as British residents in 
Argentine territory; in any 
case they would retain their 
rights over any properties, 
keep English as their language 
and elect the members of the 
Council (to which everybody 
would be eligible), Neverthe· 
Ie s, it's a basic principle that 
the population of a territory 
may not decide on mat ters of 
sovereignty; a clear example is 
the Basque ca e in Spain, and 
it must be remembered that 
here we aren't even talking 
about t he native population, 
which was expelled in 1833. 

Banking benefits lure graduates 
Back to the role of the media, 

it is important to note that 
Argentina is usually portrayed 
as the stubborn part in the 
negotiations. When we take a 
close look, however, we see 
that it i Argentina who has 
made the most important 
concessions (acceptance of a 
joint administration, or a Hong 
Kong ty pe lease · back ), 
whereas the British haven 't 
modified their position of 
demanding Argentina with· 
drawal and return to BritL h 
control before talks, and then 
the famou referendum the 
i landers; in the meantime 
escalating conflict with 
actions such as the bloody 
sinking of a ship with 1,000 
troops outside the war zone (350 
died), then expanding the zone. 

Each pring, as college 
seniors prepare for their last 
all·nighters, they get wind of 
some poisonous information . 

Specifically, t hey learn that 
petroleum engineer and 
computer scienti ts will 
garner the top salaries after 
graduation, This year, such 
lucky dogs will start work at 
$31,000, on the average. 

For the vast majority of 
today's "career·oriented" 
se niors , however , the se 
annual bulletins offer little 
solace. The salary report 
serves as the final "class 
rank" by which graduates 
enter t he real world. I t says 
nothing about who's career· 
con~cious and who's not; 
everyone is. 

Peer com pet Ition, In fact. 
only heightens t he sense of 
urgency that nagging parents 

and high unemployment lend 
to securing a post·commence' 
ment job. Only 14 years after 
Dustin Hoffman (in The 
Graduate) looked askance at a 
career in "plastics, " the Class 
of 1982 seems de perate for 
just such an opportunity. 
Better to hitch on to a well· 
paying routine, they reason, 
than to languish in the 
uncertainty of experimen· 
tation. 

For many, that mean 
taking t he plunge into 
banking. Almost daily, for 
example, several dozen Brown 
Univer ' ity senior rise at 
dawn to sign up for interviews 
with bank represent at ives. A!> 
elsewhere, the competition i 
fierce for "bank trainee" slots 
at places such as Citicorp, 
Manufact urers Hanover and 
First ational ~ank of Boston .

"Most of the students on 
line want to live in New York 
or Boston and make enough 
money to afford a high 
lifestyle ," admitted David 
Marcus, Brown enior class 
president. "They definitely 
aren't fascinated with IRA' 
( individual retirement 
accounts). " 

Certainly , there' a rich 
tradition of bank apprentices 
who work their way from 
teller up to senior vice 
president. But as the 
managerial ranks of financial 
houses have expanded (more 
than 50 percent) since 1972, 
banking opportunities have 
become a salvation for many 
panicked seniors. orne 10,000 
of thi s year's graduates, 
according to the American 
Bankers Association, will have 
been saved by September. 

Said Dave Huddleston , 
college recruiting manager for 
Chase Manhattan Bank: 
"We're reaching out to a lot 
more student today . We're 
looking for the well·rounded 
recruit. All our clients· aren't 
business majors, .0 why 
should our employee be?' 

Ind eed, it see ms that 
undergraduate desperados 
don't need much background 
to make a career out of finance. 
Headhunter notice good 
presen tat ion , reasonable 
number s of s kill ' and 
affability . 

Oddly enough, Brown' s 
Marcus told our reporter, John 
Riccardi, that at least half of 
all bank·bound graduate!> 
" have the notion that they'll 
be in banking for only five 
years, just to make a little

Clubhouse cotnfort Pad's k ey 
Here's a small quiz for all of the real sports 

fans who know baseball: What does a pro 
baseball team's locker room like like? a) your 
high school locker room; b) your high school's 
visiting team's locker room; c) Sak's Fifth 
Avenue; or d) not enough information given . 
(Answer in last paragraph.) 

Well , before last night , when I saw the Padre 
massacre the Pittsburgh Pirate, my gues 
wou ld have been either a or b. But pro baseball 
has become big busine s for everyone involved 
and the clubhouses are good indicators as to 
how successful a ball team is. Now, for all of you 
who are worned about when this article is going 
to throw in the dirty jocks, howers, and 
tobacco stain, don't worry; they're at the end. 
I'd love to be a third tring catcher and wander 
back to that posh resort for pseudo-athletes who 
swing tree branches while wearing long shorts. 
If I were a pitcher, I'd love to be pulled and sent 
to the showers. "Thanks, coach, good move." 
The Padres clubhouse is the clubhouse of a 
normally sul:r.500 baseball team. I can'l 
imagine what I would find in the Yankees' 
clubhouse. 

When you walk into Sak's Fifth Avenue in La 
Jolla, to the right are all of the newest fashions 
and styles, and on the left are the mannequins, 
plush carpetmg With studio lighting and 
mirrored windows. The Padres mu t have the 
same in terior decorator. Manager Dick 
Williams' officellocker room is to the right and 
the players' side I to the left. 

Williams' office is about first·base to econd· 
ba. e w!de and pitcher to catcher long. The 
cellmg IS about 20 feet short of a major league 

pop up ~nd the walls areas thick a Ted Leitner. 
To call It an office is like calling the Queen Mary 
a boat. 

During interviews, I went to the back of the 
room to get a chair, and by the time I returned, 
Williams had showered and gone home. He's got 
tiny pennant flags from every ball club he's 
coached for and they cover the entire left wall. 
On the right are the blueprints for Jack Murphy 
Stadium in ca e he wants to neak out the back 
way. In the middle of his interview, hi s man · 
servant brought in hi strict diet of blood·red 
chili and a light beer. (You remember that chili 
like dad used to make: it looked better coming 
out than it did going in .) 

Yankee ex· coach Bob Lemon keeps returning 
to coach because he has togo hometoa tiny New 
York apartment with no heat , and the 
clubhouse is so inviting with three·inch 
carpeting. 

Each player's locker (or stall ) is about the size 
of a nice La lolla apartment and is filled with 
everything from cleats to refrigerators with 
s mudge·proof doors. When the players come in 
after the.game,the trainer picks up every stitch 
of c10thmg Without ever once asking they 
player to "stand up going into third next time 
so I won't have to wash it again." The showers 
are hot in the modern ense of the word, with 
pre-soap, soap and conditioner dispensers and 
no· fog mirrors. 

The Padres ha\'e become the team to watch in 
the NL West. The reason: they want toget back 
to tudio lighting and dimmers in a hurry, 0 
they Win.

Promotions could give Padres record attendance 
Cap Ni2:ht, Bat Night, 

Lady's Day, the Diamond 
Giveaway, BIll Veeck, Charlie 
0 ., and a free night for guys 
named Joe. 

Baseball promotions are 
misunderstood. Many still 
don't see the theory behind 
these gate hype . The idea is 
not to attract fans to a poor 
game, but to fill an already 
bulging stadium. 

Example: Earlier this 
season, San Diego Padres v . 
LA Dodgers, April 17, Cap 

ight. San Diego Stadium. It 
is Saturday. The Dodgers are 
the defending World Champi· 
ons. They are also despised by 
San Diego fans . The Padre 
are just beginning to roll. The 
game and rivalry will bring in 
25·30,000 by itself, but add a 
free hat and -voila- the live 
gate climbs to 47,000. 

Better Example: May 1-2.

Ro e, Mike Schmidt, Steve 
Carlton - meet the second 
place Padres in San Diego. 
Saturday Night the Padres 
hand out bats, and unday 
afternoon the Beach Boys 
perform after the game. The 
Phillies are popular, the 
Padres are hot. and two games 
would have attracted 50· 
60,000 fans easy. 

But by adding a giveaway 
and a concert, San Diego packs 
in 41,000 Sat urday night. and 
sell out the Stadium Sunday 
afternoon. Over 90,000 attend 
the two games. (fn contrast, 
the same two teams draw 
3 1,000 Friday without a 
promotion.) 

This strategy of hyping good 
early season games , and 
ignoring the Cubs in August, 
is nothing new, Bill Veeck 
discovered it in t he 1950's. He 
promoted everything, gave 
away anything - and it 

worked. He se t baseball 
attenda nce records wi t h 
several teams. 

Charlie Finley appeared in 
the 1960's to refine the art of 
promoting. Among his babies: 
Hot Pants Day (free admission 
for any woman - or man?-
wearing short shorts), Halt· 
pnce Family Night, and free 
seats for anyone with facial 
hair (he pu bliCized Moustache 
Day by asking hi Oakland A's 

Sunday 
an Diego's record dropped 

to 21·18 after the .Pittsburgh 
Pirates and pitcher John 
Candeleria shut them down to 
win 4·2. 

The Padres had scored L9 
runs in the previous two 
games, beating Pittsburgh 7·5 
and ]2·3.

Monetary incentives were

has a handlebar to shov. for 
that promotion.) 

But b,- the late 1970' 
nothing could help Oakland's 
attendance. The A's were in 
last place, drawmg 2-5,000 a 
game. Charlie O. had a 
warehouse full of giveaway 
leftovers. And no taker" The 
Seatle Mariners came to town 
one day and Finley attempted 
to clear out the merchandise. 
He handed away seat 
cushions, caps, pennants, 
po ter and green autographed 
Don Baylor Bat . Baylor had 
left Oakland for Anaheim two 
years earlier. The game 
attract ed 4,700. 

With hi gimmicks and 
gimcracks Flnlev turned 
promotion into sideshows.

Sixers cure throat disease 
There was a definite rhythm 

to yesterday's Bo sto n-
Philadelphia Ea tern Con-
ference Champion hip game_ 
A oattern_ a flow _ 

The Philadelphia 76'ers 
would e tabli h lead , the 
Celtic would rally and alma t 
erase them _ Back and forth_ 

The vocal Boston crowd 
reflected the game, their 
emotions went up and down 
with their team; they cheered 
wildly when the Celtic fast-
break was working, and were 
quiet when Philadelphia was 
hal. 

In that respect the contest 
was no different than a dozen 

other 76'er-Celtic games_ 
Philadelphia often leads, and 
So ton, more often than not , 
rallies to win _ Thi happened 
last year when Philadelphia 
blew a 3-1 series lead to lose 
the best-of-seven series, and it 
happened la t Friday night 
when the Sixers blew another 
lead to let Boston even the 
series at 3-3_ 

Apparently the pressure is 
too much for Philadelphia. 
They crack_ They shoot 
poorly _ Reporters, fans, and 
broadcasters call it choking. 
Everyone assu med that 
Philadelphia would choke 
again Sunday_ 

Seniors head for bank 
conlintled from page 12 
money and move onto 
something les s todgy -" 
Nonetheless, the banking 
world' consi tently low 
tu rnover rates indicate that 
many graduates apparently 
enjoy their new life too much 
to think there could be any 
other. 

We understand that an 
al most irrational fear of 
poverty tends to afflict seniors 
during their final year. At 22, 
many seem to feel that time is 
running out on (hem. 

Yet. th re is also somethmg 
to this "technologlcal age" 
that seem" to breed among our 
contemporaries a lack of 
confidence in non-technical 
areas. With rhe attention 
given to math and science 
wIzardry, many graduates 
forget (or never realize) that 

there is a great need all over 
the country for people who can 
speak, write and think clearly. 
Some people say the liberal 
arts are dead, but such skills 
will never be obsolete. 

Naturally, not everyone who 
entered college four years ago 
planned to graduate with a job 
offer in hand . Many students 
aSSIduously avoided the career 
question in order to 
concent rate on other mailers. 

But this faction seems to be 
dwindlmg. 

Unless seniors expect to 
..,h(m off a spouse, two 
children and a mortgage at 
theIr Flft h-Year Reunion in 
1987. they probabl) don't need 
to graduate to a. 30,UOO-a·year 
cont racl. On much less, one 
can get along \ery well and 
find out what the big bucks are 
reall! wort h. 

The Celtics are a popular 
team . A dynasty. They are 
associated with pride, poise, 
character. (They are also 
associated with some very 
good, and very white players 
- but that of course has 
nothing to do with their 
popularity.) 

It would have been natural 
for the Sixers to crumble and 
Boston to triumph. But that 
did not happen. Philadelphia 
withstood every Boston charge 
- or rather Julius Erving did 
- and walked away with the 
game, 120-106. 

De s pite the 14 - point 
winning margin , the game was 
close. Boston never let up, 
Philadelphia was rarely out of 
trouble. It was a fitting final 
game between two incredible 
rivals. 

Boston had their chances, 
and the 76'ers finally 
exorcised the demon in their 
throats. 

Now Philadelphia will meet 
the Los Angeles Lakers 
Thursday in the first game of 
the NBA Championship 

eries. 
The Laker have also been 
as ociated with a few terms 
lately: incredible , Magic , 
perfect . They destroyed 
Phoenix in four straight 
games, and beat San Antonio 
4·0 to set a playoff record for 
consecutive \'ictories. 

Lo~ Angeles is running. 
gunning, playing defense and 
appears to be unstopable. Who 
knows how far the amazing 
Kurt Rambis can take this 
team. But. ...

Local TV to air soccer cup 
San Diego soccer fans won 't stal ions the day I hey are 

have to travel to Spain to see played, 
World Cup competition this 
ummer . From June 13 

through July 10, nearly 30 
matches of soccer's famed 
international contcst will be 
brought here via satellite by 
San Diego public television 
station KPBS/TV I5, inclu· 
ding the semi-final and third 
place consolation matches. 

Matches will be selected by 
the producers according to 
their importance and timing, 
edited to one·hour, transmit-
ted to the US by satell ite, and 
aired on most public television 

Coverage of first round 
World Cup competition will 
begin on Sunday, June 13 at 3 
p.m . with Argentina vs. 
Belgium. Other firs t round 
matches already selected 
include Italy vs. Poland (6/14); 
Poland vs. Peru (6/22); and 
Germany vs. Austria (6/25). 
Second round matches are 
scheduled between June 28 
and July 7, the semi-finals are 
July 8 and 9, and the third-
place consolation match airs 
Saturday, July to. 

Bottle Bill initiative 
continued from page 6 
to the CalPIRG researcher. 
Through a coalition they have 
named "Californians for 
Sensible Laws," the manufac-
turers will attempt to convince 
voters that the initiative is 
"well·intentioned" but 
mi s guided . While telling 
people that the Recycling 
Initiative won't help recycling 
and litter problems, the 
industry wil l propose 
"alternatives ... 

Ads against the bottle bills 
in other tates have portrayed 
environmentali ts as "u nre-
alistic. wild·eyed eco-freaks," 
while the business leaders 
have been hown as "bastions 
of caution and common 
sense," Shireman said. 

The campaign in California 
will be highly vi ible. In 
addItIon to a massive 
teleVIsion and radio campaign, 
consumers should expect to 
see anti-recyling initiati\'e ads 
on grocery bags. on six'packs 

of beer and on store windows. 
The beverage industry plans 
to take advantage of its ready 
access to voters through 
supermarkets, according to 
Shireman 's research. 

Recent polls have shown 
that more than 80 percent of 
California voters favor the 
deposit law, but Shireman said 
the bottle bill proponents will 
have to work hard to retain 
that margin . 

"Ca lifornians Against 
Waste and t he other groups 
behind the initiative are going 
to be outspent at least 10 Lo 
one, and they're going to be up 
against lick ads and clever 
slogans . Success in November 
is going to rely on a grassroots 
slyle which builds on itself and 
get voters to the polls," ~aid 
Shireman . 

Shireman is the author of 
the 240·page CaIPIRG·

With most of the hoopla for musical 
groups at lJCSD centered on such 
behemot hs as [an Hunter, Greg Kihn, 
Chick Corea, and King Crimson, our 
own student groups have not been 
gettIng the recognition they deserve. 

Granted, you may have been able to 
see a few of them In between cla ses at 
the Revelle Plaza or theMidd leofMuir. 
But exposure for most has been limited 
to a few passer -by at occasional 
practIce or jam sessions. 

What makes this lack of exposure 0 
un fort unat e is the fact t hat there is a 

great amount of musical dl\cr~lty and 
talent in our ~Iudenl bands. Con~idt'r 
for a moment t hal one can hear rot:k, 
new-v,,'ave, a\ ant garde funk. a 
barbero.;hop quartel, or a blend of 
se\eral different genres b} simply 
taking time OUI to listen. Although a 
few of t he bands are st ill In t he form ing 
stages, ot her~. not ably Loose Change. 
Steel Breeze. and Some Philharmtmil', 
are established fixl lIres on campus, 
and t he} are start Ing to make wa\t's m 
the musIC world. 

Aside from the obvIOUS intentions of 
the bands, that bemg to plea~e bot h 
themselves a nd theIr audience 
mu "ically and emotionally while 
picking up a few bucks on the side, 
there remains a high degree of 
individual and group motivation that 
goes beyond simply performing for 

-other. 
While most of us feel that school is 

ou r primary concern, a vehicle in 
reachi ng our highest goal, many 
musicians give equal weight to their 
music - for it is also the means of 
achieving ~ life-long desire. Others, 

however, play musIC not Wllh car{'t'r

Letter to the Editor 

Big and little lies 
about the Falklands 
Editor: 

I would like to supplement 
and call attention to a couple of 
point in Mr. Ghenis' well· 
presented article, "Getting the 
Fact s traight About the 
Falklands War," Guardian, 
May 24, 1982. 

Fir tit he is ue of 
Argent ina u ing force. In 
taying with the commitment 

to explicate only complete and 
accurate informat ion, it 
should be pointed out that 
General Galtteri made a 
conression to the other 
members of the governing 
junta, as a condition to hi. 
acquirIng the pre idential 
appointment late la t year. At 
that time Galtieri agreed that 
by one means or another the 
i. ue of the Malvina - Islands. 
disputed for over 100 years 
would be resolved during his 
term of office. It is obvious 
today that AdmIral Jorge 
Anaya (often considered the 
Hawk of the ruling three) \\as 
in favorof a military procedure 
since he has most ofl en 
rejected . ome Inequitable 
agreements. 

Of real con~eC(ul'ncl' 
however, I~ the issue of I he 
medIa's mdl~criminate use of 
British account of the 
fighting. There i~ no doubt 
that both sides have been 
guilty of faulty accounting of 
their gains and losses, This is 
no new issue, since as late as 
Monday's ABC Nightline(May 
24) news show, the issue was 
addressed by stating that 
Argentina was more at fault 
than the British, in their 
opmion. They didn't bolher to 
support theIr hvpothesi!-. . The 
rea"on they dIdn't \\a:; 
hecause, If 'one tot al.. the

The Bottom Line 

li(erall~' ha\ e been out of 
commission ... but they're not. 
They must therefore be prettv 
good at patching remnants 
toge! her. If in fact one reads 
deeper into papers like the 
L. A. Times (w ho at lea~t have 
t heir own foreign correspon· 
dents in both capitals), you 
usually find deep in the paper 
near the foods section that the 
total of absolutely confirmed 
and verified losses only 
amounts to 33 aircraft. (thl' 
from a Brit ish sourcr). 

But who really reads the 
food section? There are 
hundreds of examples by now 
the 6th week of the conflict. 
Britain still refuses to admIt 
the losses of personnel and 
ships, and when they ha\'e it 
has always been se\'eral days 
afl er t he fact. What I really 
enjoy aboul the British, 
however, is the\\avthevclaim 
t hal t heir airpiane~ and 
helicopter.., and shIps keep 
suffering all the"e temble 
a("cuit'lIls. If YOU rOI;J1 t h('lr 
reports of k)~1 fight er:-; and 
helicopters you realize that 
'lcariy 70 percent of their 
alrerait are lost through t hp'il' 
IIl·fated aCCIdents, I'm no 
slrateglst, but my suggestIon 
to the Argentme Generals 
would Ix> to dIg in and let the 
British do all t he fighting 
alone. No doubt they will wipe 
themselves out through their 
own ineptness in a matter of a 
few weeks. 

The major American media 
gi\'es the Impression that 
Argentma is relat I\'ely alone, 
and their cause has \'ery Itttle 
support. If one takes the time

Hassles brew over revising abortion law 

Duekmejian accused of manipulating laws for political purposes 
By HENRY CH LMAN 

Sucramcnlo Corre 'jponden1 
A new ruling on the state'<; 

15-year-old abortion law has 
spawned rumors that high-
level s taffers in Attorney 
General George Deukmejlan 's 
office revised the opinion to 
make it politi cal1y more 
compatible with his campaign 
for governor. 

Deukmejian, who is eeking 
the Republican gu bernatorial 
nominati on , refu s ed to 
comment specifically about 
the abortion ruling at a press 
conference recentl y, but he 
adm itt ed diff e ren ce of 
opinion often exist among 
attorneys in his office. 

"Ultimately, the opinion is 
iss u ed as th e att orn ey 
general 's opinion," Deukme-
jian sa id . "There are different 
drafts. different opin ions and 
changes. exactly the same 
thing that occurs in appellate 
court decis ions." 

Appell at e and upreme 
courts often circulate varying 
opInions on a particular issue 
among Judges. who debate the 
POInt" and ultimately produce 
a majority ruling, perhaps 
Joined wnh a minority opinion. 

Deukmejlan admitted a 

similar situation exists in his 
offi ce. Reporte rs recent ly 
que<;tlO ned him about the 
motive behind the final ru ling 
in the abortion opinion, but 
neit her he nor his ASSIstant 
Att or n ey Ge n e r al J ack 
Winkler would explain how 
thi s decision was reached. 

The ruling, is ued April 27 
and signed by both Deukm e-
jian and Winkler, stat es that 
the section in California' . 1967 
Therapeutic Abortion Act 
outlawing abortions after the 
20th week of pregnancy is 
enforceable, unle s the life or 
health of the moth er is 
endangered, or if the fetus is 
demonstrably non· viable. 

Deukmej ian was asked to 
rule on that particular section 
of the st ate's Health and 
Welfa re Code by Los Angele 
District Attorney John Van de 
Kamp, who is running for the 
Democratic nominatio n to 
succeed Deukmejian Van de 
Kamp was contemplat ing 
prosecution against a 
Woodland Hills doctor who 
reportedly performed numer-
ous abortions after the 20th 
we 'I-. of pregnancy. 

Van de Kamp saId last week 
he \\111 conSIder the attorney 

general's finding and deCide 
later whether he wIll file 
charges agamst the doctor. 

According to a May 11 report 
m The Los A ngele:s Times. 
sources in the county's dlstnct 
atLornev's office understood 
the attorney general's staff 
was ready to interpret the law 
against any pro ecutlon for 
late a bortions, based on 
several court rulIngs tr ikmg 
down similar law' in other 
states. 

But that pO~lt\On was 
re"ersed by superIOrs In 
J)eukmeJian's office. The 
Times quoted sources as 
<.;a) mg. 

Two additional factors have 
generated suspiCIOn about the 
final outcome of the nine·page 
rulmg. First, DeukmeJlan is 
embroiled In a neck-and·neck 
electoral struggle to capture 
the RepublIcan gu rnatorial 
nomination, which depends 
upon crUCIal conservative 

-,upport. 
Sl"Cond, thl' ruling contams 

apparent InconSI'>t ('nCles 
between the comluslon and 
the analYSIS. leadIng some to 
believe the, \\ere ""rltlen b\

For You r Healt h By Adam Barton Austin 

Dr. Reuben delivers 
message on nutrition 

In hi s inimItable and often 
humorous style. Dr. David Reuben is 
able to deliver a olid message in his 
bestseller, Everything You Always 
Wanted To Know About Nutrition . The 
book is written on the premise that the 
greatest threat to American survival is 
not any nuclear weapon, but the unfit 
food of the American diet. 

The highly acclaimed author of 
Everytlziug You Always Wanted To 
Kllow About Sex and The Save Your 
Life Diet deal honestly and often 
bluntly with the many facet s of 
American diet and nutritiun . In the 
question a nd an. wer format that run 
throughout the book, Reuben compiles 
information on all areas of nutrition . 

On vitamins, Reu ben stands in 
s taunch opposition. proclaiming that 
the vitamin manufacturers are 
misleading the public to make 
themselves the big industry they are , 
Although he recognizes their 
importance to good healt h, he counters 
by s tating, "every vitamin, every 
mineral. every substance required for 
perfect heal th can be obtained from the 
food you eat." 

Regarding facts, Reuben ex po e the 
egg·chole. terol ·heart attack myth. He 
a lso explains and warns about 
aturated and hydrogenated fat s and 

oil. with special attention to the cheap 
a nd highly s aturated coconut 011 which 
appears in most modern processed 
food '. 

Reuben relat es the facts about 
ca rbohydrates in general and 
s pecifically in the American diet by 
focusing on the word "enriched." He 
prefers the word "imitation" to 
"enriched" citing that the only thing 
truthful about the terms "enriched 
white bread" and "enriched white 
flour" is that they are definitely white! 
He continues with words about food 
additive . preservatives and fiber, 

The discu s ion of protein 
concentrates on amino acids. protein 
requirements. denutrified milk and 
c hemicalized meat. Reuben illustrates 
hi point with the following incident. 
American dried milk was ent to Asian 
and African nation to help the 
malnourished . But instead of making 
them well, it only made them more ill. 

So what did fin all y happen to all that 
expensive, high- protein, fortified. 
American s kim milk? The resourcefu l 
natives were perfect ly content to use 
the powdered mIlk to whitewash their 
villages. 

To sugar, Reuben devotes an 
extensive discourse. He notes the 
s imliarity between this "non-food" 
and cocaine. Diabetes and artificial 
sweeteners are also highlighted , But 
on the s u bject of sugar , Reuben makeS' 
a most inflammatory statement: " [f 
any food processor us ed a food additive 
that was one tent h a s dangerous as v. e 
know refined sugar to be, that food 
additive would be banned by the FDA 
within 24 hours." 

Reuben concludes by challengmg 
the "Poison Squad" (Food and Drug 
Administration ) to clean up the 
American food indu s try and to protect 
the public. And he challenges the food 
indust ry to lay down their chemicals 
and their copies of Food Engineermg (a 
magazine that tells how to make 
chemicals ta te like food ) and return to 
feeding the American pu bli c a 
healthful, non·synthetic. nutritiou 
diet. 

Wi th humor. anger and compassion. 
Reuben gives Ihe public a powerful 
bo0k. Designed to make the reader Sit 
up and take nOl1ce, It does just that in 
the thoughtfu l, thorough way that is 
unique to Dr. Reuben . 

[n addition. thiS book serves as a 
milestone. Reuben. a member of the 
scientific community. comesout on the 
side of the holi tic/ natureopathi c 
commu nit y. This crossover is 
significant because more and more 
often we are now seeing member of 
the scientific community, physicians 
in particular, taking to heart the pleas 
of the naturopat hi c/ holi st ic 
practitioner for preventative 
medicine and health and nutrition 
education . 

Everythmg Y(Ju Wauted To Kllou' 
Aboul NutritiOIl is an important

Imposters will continue to 
work together. 

Although the attitude of the 
[mpo ter if typical of most 
groups, orne bands feel that 
playing in front of as many 
people a possible i not 
always the first step toward 
success. Network, a band 
which blends new wa\ie 
rhythms with a rock base, ha 
a unique attitude. "Unlike 
most other bands, we prefer 
not to p'lay at TGs and 
partie,' ay Marwan 
Bardewil, guitarist and 
clavinetist. "One of the main 
reason forthi i thefactthat 
we play only original ongs, 
whereas at dances and parties, 
mo t people prefer to hear 
omething they are already 

familiar with. Our primary 
goal right now is to make demo 
tape and hpefully establi h 
ourselves through recor-
dings_ " 

Network won't be subjected 
to d total lack of exposure, 
however, in that they plan to 
perform at campus talent 
hows. 
What the previously 

mentioned musicians have in 
common are firmly estab-
lished goals. bot h indivudally 
and as groups. For some, that 
goal is a club to TG 
engagement, whereas for 
others a recording contract IS 

The UCSD Guardian 

The Imposters are becoming favorites with the Muir crowd. 

the next big step. These 
musician regard their music 
as more than a simple hobby, 
or occasional relea e from 
school. Since mo t of them 
have been studying and 
playing for years, they are 
ready to establish themselves 
for the future. 

Marta Morici puts it best 
when 'he avs, "[f it weren't 
for mv band: J wouldn't be in 
school right now . It 's 
practically my life. " 

There are, however , 
musicians and bands at UCSD 
with quite a different outlook. 
For the e performers, music is 
basically a release from the 
rigors of school and work. 

For many of u ,a trek to the 
beach of participation in 
intramural sports gives us an 
opportunity to forget our 
trou bles and anx let ies. The 
same is true for these 
musicians. Instead of sliding 
into second base they would 
rather slide into a few chords. 

One group in particular 

with this attitude is Vicious 
Rumour, a Muir-based rock 
quartet. Mark Sell, bassist for 
the group, empha izes this 
point. "We're not really 
concerned with pursuing a 
recording contract. or getting 
club dates. For the mo t part, 
playing in a band is a way of 
relieving pressures and having 
a good time." 

Although Sell is a music 
mInor. he is not really thinking 
in terms of a career in music, 
as Morici and Marannon are. 
"The atmosphere of school, 
with so much time devoted to 
study, cannot really foster a 
band - there's simply not 
enough time to establish a 
career·oriented group. At the 
moment, school is my primary 
concern. " 

Thi feeling is hared by 
Vince Cummings, lead singer 
for the Ream Ensemble. "For 
me, singing in a band is 50 
percent for the love of music 
and 50 percent for a release

Two guys who are 
on the bands' side 

By TIM AUGUST 
Slaff Writer 

Anyone who reads the 
Guardian c1assifieds with any 
regularity probably has 
not iced t he numerous ads for 
S&D, an organization that's 
apparently willing to provide a 
sound system to any band for 
rehearsals, parties, concerts or 
whatever. 

Puzzled? Well S&D is two 
friends, Phillip Detchmendy 
and Brian Simison, second 
year Revelle tudents, who are 
committed to providing a 
service - often free of charge 
- to any group that needs it. 

S&D represents a part of a 
long term goal Detchmendy 
and Simison have that is 
grounded in a strong interest 
in music and a desire to give 
new bands a break, with the 
eventual goal of getting an 
original band a start in the 
music business. 

S&D's intentions are well 
directed , and duly appreciated 
by many campus bands who 
cannot begin to afford their 
own P.A., or have the means to 
hire a sound technician. 
Furthermore, as Detchmendy 
puts it, "We'll never even 
charge a band to rent the 
system if they don't make any 
money on the gig," which is 
often the case for many new 
bands. 

Detchmendy stresses that 
their commitment to mus ic is 
the primary reason for 

providing su'ch a valuable 
. ervice "because we wanted to 
do something in music. We're 
tired of the stuff on the radio 
and want to give good groups 
any chance we can." 

The determination of S&D 
is particularly manifest in 
their sizable investment in the 
sound system. Say Detch-
mendy, "We took out a couple 
of loans to pay for the P .A., and 
any money we make on it goes 
back into paying for new and 
better equipment. ' 

For the time being, 
Detchmendy and Simison are 
content pro\iiding their 
equipment to anybody who 
wants it. However they would 
like to branch out into 
promo! ion of groups and 
maybe even set up a studio 
where bands could come to 
rehearse and record, "but 
that' years off" according to 
Detchmendy . 

They are just students, but 
their commitment to music 
and desire to provide a viable 
service is quite commendable, 
especially to bands trying to 
get started m the mu ic 
busines . "Right now [ would 
like to get into film .. .f'm a 
Visual Arts major" says 
Detchmendy, "But r wouldn't 
mind making a career out of 
this. At least I could possibly 
support myself in graduate 
school when I get there."

• I 
It's been a while, folks, since 

we've talked to you la t. but you 
must understand . Intramural 
Sports this quarter at the 01' "U" is 
hard to figure. The Budman has 
already short -circuited several 
campus computer trying to chart 
out this Spring' IM play-off 
action. Even IBM in all of its 
infinite wisdom would have a 
tough time with this set of data. In 
mo t instances, things areju t too 
close to call.

So when the Budman gets 
himself in sticky situations such 
as t his , he goes to his back-up 
system. It's a system not bent 
towards failure. Proven, time-
tested over years of in tramural 
action, you can 't lose with this 
baby. And the funny thing is you 
can get it at almost any retail store 
in America ... aah yes, the tall. ice-

Dividing the athletic budget 
By PHIL LAUDER 

tatl Writer 

Past Guardian article have 
described the progress UCSD 
athletics has made. The 
g reat es t t hreat t o t he 
continuat IOn of this progress 
is, pred ic t ab ly, mo ney 
shortages. Present monetary 
demands far outnumber the 
doll ars available. This i" 
certainly no secret to anyone 
Invohed In the athletic 
department, but thoseaffected 
most direct Iv are the coaches 
and athlete": 

Coaches' salaries are 
minimal. "Below $2.000" is 
how athletic director Judy 
Sweet describes many of these 
salaries. She is well-award of 
how unsat isfactory such sums 
are. as are the coaches. 

As baseball coach Lyle Yale, 
assessd his situation, "It's 
been tough. I will definitely 
have to find a part-time job 
<.;omewhere el'ie next \lear." 

Manv have alreadv donc 
thiS. ~'olleyball coach Doug 
Danne\ ik, for example.

often having to payout of their 
own pocket s expenses usually 
paid by universi tie . Due to 
bud get a r y co n st rai n t s, 
allowances for overnight trips 
are necessa rily conserved . 
Yates says the baseball team 
at times had to use the gym 
floors of host schools as their 
overnight housing. 

Meal allowance~ are 
generallv described as fair. 
Volleyball players. for 
example. have to make it on 
"$2 a day for breakfast. $2 for 
lunch. and. ·1 for dinner For 
hungry at hletes away from

Dannl:vik: " "leal allowance.,

it." says Dannevi k. Crew 
rower Mat t Ashley describes 
one team trip to the Bay Area 
as "San Francisco on $4 a 
day." 

Without going into dept h. 
this should be enough to give a 
good "cnse of the issue 
Involved. The next question IS 
how much money IS aVailable 
to cover these e<)sts. and whv 
Isn't that enough? J 

{'LSD's total athil'tic 
budget IS $270.000. :'.lore than 
half of thi ..... $139.000. b 
devoted to covering team 
expenses. equipment costs.

conference membership dues 
and travel ex pence" The 
balance of t he budget goes

salaries. the ' salaries of fuJ1-

14 The UCSD Guardian 

No Canadiens have no \\Tin 
By ELAINE WALLACE 

Staff Write r 
"Are you really going to 

write a story about our team?" 
Ron Uchimura asked me. I had 
covered the men's "A" 
volleyball match between No 
French Canadien and the 
TKEs on Sunday night. 

r heard thesamethingat the 
game when a referee looked at 
me and asked, "What are you 
taking note for?" 

r began to wonder. 
My answer was that r am 

'aving the sports section from 
bemg overrun WIt h tories 
about the Padres and pro 
basketball. 

After all. neither the all 
Diego l'niollortheLA Times is 

too likely to cover UCSD 
intramural teams. 

I went to the game with my 
roommate. We decided that 
intramural volleyball isn't 
played for fun . Not when both 
teams looked so serious. 

TKE was somewhat more 
organized - they even had a 
rooting section. Early in the 
first game, they took the lead , 
and kept it. 

It got a little rough, or so it 
eemed to me. I wouldn't want 

to dive into the rec gym floor . 
BUI both teams did. making 
the piays close. 

No French C anadiens 
weren't up to their usual par. 
They dIdn't take their 
customary bel ween game jog

around the court. Th~y cared 
thou~h. It was obvious in Dean 
Petit s sweat-soaked face and 
in Moonho Lee 's almost 
emotional involvement. 

TKE was more stoic. Is that 
part of their charm? 

I asked one of their fans, Ian 
Cunningham, for background. 

Just then, TKE president 
Chris Ambrose served into the 
net. Cunningham explained, 
"But he tries hard".That's 
why he' president." 

About the captain, Brad 
"Garv" Wendlon , he had two 
words. "Women swoon. " 

Perhap o\'er hIS volleyball 
talent. Both he and Chns 
Wiggins prOVIded powerful 
ser.·es and support for their 
team. 

TKE took the first two 
games, capitalizing on long 
ralhes But by the third game, 
~o French Canadiens were 
lookmg good. Again though, 
they \\cre heaten back.

I'd understand if No French 
Canadiens did. The\- needed 
on ly one of the three 'games to 
make the playoffs and were 
di"appointed over the match. 

They handled II well. Petit , 
who had told me t hat his team 
wa. "bad-ass" rephrased his 
lumnwnl.
