Court III_on 
.. "" r. Reg"" 
WASHINGTON, D.C. - The 
U.S. Supreme Court reached a 
decision on Smith v. Regents 
last week, letting stand the 
Stale Supreme Court ruling 
from last February which 
concluded that mandatory fees 
could not be imposed to 
support political organizations 
on campus. The Supreme 
Court released its ruling 
without comment. UC schools 
that have charged a mandatory 
fee in the past are now 
grappling with how best to 
comply with the ruling without 
cutting student resources. 

Search For New 
Chancellor Begins 
SANTA BARBARA - The 
process of selecting a new 
chancellor for UCSB began 
last Thursday as the advisory 
council spent seven hours 
meeting with students, staff, 
faculty, alumni and commu-
nity members. The advisory 
council consists of seven 
regents, five faculty, two 
students, one staff member 
and one alumni representa-
tive. Concerned groups gave 
their views to the council 
during closed meetings. UC 
President Jack Peltason will 
make the final selection.

DAVIS - The Center for 
Comparative Medicine, a new 
research facility, will combine 
the resources of Davis' 
Medical and Veterinary 
schools to study comparative 
medicine. The facility will be 
located outside campus at the 
California Regional Primate 
Research Center. "A major 
mission or goal of the Center 
for Comparative Medicine is 
to utilize disease disciplines 
for the development of 
disease models in animals," 
said Paul Luciew of the 
Department of Pathology in 
the School of Medicine.

Top UC, CSU 
Officials Hold 
Rrst Meeting 
BUDGET: Regents, trustees 
discuss education's future at 
yesterday's historic event 
By Ely Rabanl 
Staff Writer 

SACRAMENTO - In what was billed as 
an historic first forthe state of California, the 
University of California Board of Regents 
held ajoint meeting yesterday with the Cali-
fornia State University Board of Trustees in 
the State Assembly Chamber. 

The meeting, which many have said re-
flects the close working relationship between 
UC President Jack Peltason and CSU Chan-
cellor Barry Munitz, was intended to assess 
the two universities' options in light of the 
ongoing budget crisis facing higher educa-
tion, in addition tp mapping a long-term 
strategy for education into the next century. 

UC President Emeritus Clark Kerr, who 
was instrumcDlal ia developing the Califor-
nia Master Plan for Higher Education in the 
1960s,asked the two boards and state gov-
ernment to preserve the goals of the Master 
Plan by formulating a "resource plan" for 
higher education. Because of the state's eco-
nomic slump, Kerr said, "Higher education 
is not fighting for its survival, it's fighting 
for its soul." 

"To take away that promise of opportu-
nity" made in the Master Plan "would be an 
extreme disaster for the state of the Califor-
nia," Kerr added. 

In his address to the regents and the trust-
ees, Gov. Pete Wilson said that the state is 
"actually increasing spending at both UC 
and CSU," referring to dollar amounts allo-
cated by the state. Wilson added that "about 
a third of the fee increases has been ear-

Fees Likely to 
Rise Next Year

Aaoc:late News Editor 

Students may be paying $600 to $650 more 
in fees for the 1994-95 year, according to the 
University of California Office of the 
President's proposed operating budget, re-
leased earlier this month. 

The budget report said that fee increases of 
roughly $600 are likely to be implemented 
over the next several years to compensate for 
a shortfall in state fundina to the UC system. 
Baed on figures from the UC Office of the 
President, student fees have risen by 125 
percent since 1990. 

According to University of California Stu-
dent AsIociation (UCSA) Field Representa-
tive Donnie Emerick. the State Department of

Students Come Out at Noon Rally 
.., Shannon BrIIdy 
Guardian Reporter 

Miserable weather did not rain on the UCSD 
Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Association's 
(LGBA) parade of speakers at Monday's noon 
Nalional Coming Out Day (NeOD) rally in 
the Price Center. 

Althoug~ drizzle delayed the rally 10 min-
utes, the event got under way when a song 
professing, "I'm coming out, I want the world 
to know, I want to let it show" was played over 
loudspeakers in the Price Center Plaza. 

The rally was just one part of the fifth 
annual NCOD, a nationwide event intended 
to raise awareness and acceptance of gays, 
lesbians and bisexuals. 

"Being queer enters relationships, careers 
and all other parts oflife. Most straight people 
don't care, especially if they don't know any-
one queer," said Lesbian and Gay Commu-
nity Center Assistant Administrator Tony 
Valenzuela. 

"Coming out is a process that takes time 
for parents as well as children to go through," 
said Diane Warner of Parents and Friends of 
Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG), a support group 
oraanizacion. 

Also speaking al the rally was Carolina 
RamoIofMommies and Me, a support group 
for lesbian mothers and their children. She 
taJked Ibout her painful marriaae at 17 and the 
difticulties of "com ina out" in Chicano cul-
ture. 

After the scheduled speakers fini shed, mem-
bers of the audience were invited to step up to 
the microphone and come out of the closet. A 
momentary lull followed the announcement 
until a group of students came forward. Ap-
plause and cheers met the participants after 
they declared their sexuality. 

Sociology graduate student Laura Choe 
was among those who watched the Price 
Center rally. "I'm amazed at the courage 
people are displaying to come out in front of 
the university," Choe said. 

Revelle College junior Raj RihaJ agreed. 
"It's cool. I saw it last year at the gym. They 
have a lot of balls," Rihal said. 

For Valenzuela, a recent graduate of 
UCSD, the event was especially significant. 
"I'm glad to see LGBA more visible. When 
I came in the fall of 1989, it was a small 
group that only organized a few social 
events," he said. 

Those who came out at the rally were just 
as pleased with the event. "I stayed up last 
'night thinking about what I would say," said 
Revelle College jlfnior Jeff Peterson. 

Not all of those present at the Price Center 
were pleased with the rally .. " think it 's a 
waste of their time, and it's embarrassing. I 
don't think it's great at all," said a Revelle 
Colle,e junior. 

As the rally concluded, LGBA members 
danced on the staae to the Sister Sledge song,. 
"We Are Family."

Student Org~es Red Cross Benefit 
CONCERT:UCSD 
senior lost everything in 
Oakland Hills fIre 
By Heather MeRe. 
GUllrdllln Reporter 

Two years ago, Steve Denyes 
lost his house in a fire that blazed 
through the Oakland Hills and 
parts of Berkeley. Denyes, now 
a Fifth College senior, was helped 
by the Red Cross after everything 
he owned was destroyed in that 
fire. 

Now Denyes is staging a ben-
efit concert at the SI. Peter's Epis-
copal Church in Del Mar to raise

The governor identified the 
length of time needed to com-
plete a degree as a crucial issue 
and also suggested that the uni-
versities could narrow the range 
of undergraduate degrees and 
majors offered as a cost-cutting 
measure. 

Speaker of the Assembly 
Willie Brown sounded a different 
message. ". think we've reached

that student voting patterns are

education. 

money for the Red Cross and to 
repay the organization in some 
way for the help he and his two 
roommates received. 

''The Red Cross gave us cloth-
ing, shoes, food vouchers and 
books for school," said Denyes, 
who was attending UC Berkeley 
at the time. "All three of us said 
that as soon as we got back on our 
feet we would do something to 
pay the Red Cross back for its 
support." 

The benefit concert is sched-
uled for Oct. 20, the second anni-
versary of the fire. There is a $5 
suggested donation at the door, 
although a larger donation would 

"If Proposition 172 fails, we'll 
be back here on Nov. 3 facing a 
disaster for local governments," 
he said. Proposition 112 is the 
state ballot initiative that would 
extend the half-cent sales tax to 
provide more funding in the state 
budget. Last month, the Board of 
Regents offered its endorsement 
of the proposition. 

Brown also expressed dismay 
over Wilson's veto of Assembly 
Bill 2227, which would have 
awarded Cal Grants based on fi-
nancial need rather than academic 
performance. "This [veto] will 
mean that pri vate institutions will 
have more influence in the state. 
That veto was orchestrated by the 
privates." Brown said. 

Much of the joint meeting was 
devoted to characterizing the chal-
lenges facing public higher edu-
cation. Many speakers noted that

ers said. 

Besides organizing the event, 
Denyes will also be perform dur-
ing the fundraiser. He will be play-
ing his own traditional folk-style 
music, including several of his 
tracks that appear on the recently 
released Del Mar Roors II from 
Belly Up Productions. 

Also scheduled to perform is 
J.L. Porter, who was also attend-
ing Berkeley at the timeofthe fire. 
Porter, a current UCSD student, 
will be playing a more pop-style 
set. The Fabulous Earrings, a local 
a cappella band, will also perform 
at the concert. 

this historic meeting took place 
because California higher educa-
tion is "a billion dollars short" of 
what it nee:ls to exist. Many also 
identified regaining public trust 
as essential to future funding. 

California Postsecondary Edu-
cation Commission (CPEC) Di-
rector Warren Fox said thesechal-
lenges result from the pressures of 
"demographics, demands, diver-
sity and downsizing" and added, 
"we need a new agenda for the 
'90s, for the short-run and for the 
21 st Century." 

Fox also said that the universi-
ties need to be more accountable 
to t~payers to regain the public 
confidence needed to receive ad-
equate state funding. 

UC Regent Glenn Campbell 
also stressed public confidence, 
saying that "until people are per-

Operation Blockade Has 
No Place In San Diego 

If the fears of many Californians are correct, the U.S.-Mexico 
border at San Diego may soon be subjected to a total shutdown 
d milar to that implemented in Operation 'Blockade near EI Paso, 
Texas. Their worries are justified - the El Paso blockade has 
done nothing but exacerbate already high tensions between the 
United States and Mexico. 

In its three weeks of operation, the blockade has succeeded in 
slowing the flow of illegal Mexican immigrants to a trickle. 
However, immigrants continue to attempt the crossing despite the 
increased risk of deportation and abuse. EI Paso residents have 
been negatively affected by a weakened economy resulting from 
the shutdown. 

The reason Operation Blockade's success has been so harmful 
is simple - the operation fails to take into account the economic 
roots of illegal immigration. It has served as a shotgun political 
approach to immigration, only serving to delay a sensible agree-
ment on how to deal with the problem. 

Similar issues would surround a blockade of the U.S.-Mexico 
border near San Diego. Local merchants along the border will 
inevitably suffer, since much of their business is dependent upon 
border interactions. In addition, an attempt to stop the influx at 
Tijuana, the busiest border crossing in the world, would be 
logistically impossible. 

The simple fact is that a border blockade does not address the 
underlying economic problems that cause immigration. The 
border exists as a panition of wealth. As long as there is signifi-
cantly more wealth nonh of the border, there will be significant 
immigration from the south. 

The major issue affecting immigration is jobs. In her speech to 
UCSD faculty and students, U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno 
argued that a better Mexican economy through the passage of 
NAFfA will lead to reduced illegal immigration in the long run. 
NAFf A, she said, will mean a wealthier Mexico with less need 
for immigration. Though it is unclear how much NAFT A will 
reduce immigration, a border blockade is certainly not a solution. 

There is little doubt that one of the biggest issues forthis year's 
elections, at least in the local scene, will be U.S. efforts to stem 
the tide of illegal immigration. So it comes as no surprise that the 
border blockade is nothing more than a reflection of how politi-
cized the entire issue has become. 

Reno calls iml)'ligration the biggest issue facing her as attorney 
general. Polls have traced a rising sentiment of frustration among 
Californians who perceive immigrants as an enormous drain on 
state resources. especially since these resources have become 
restricted in a fiscally-strapped economy. 

California Gov. Pete Wilson upped the political ante one notch 
by proposing to cut off welfare and health-care funding to illegal 
immigrants, calling it a blatant but necessary approach in dealing 
with the problem. Political moves such as these and Operation 
Blockade are only short-term remedies for a long-term economic 
problem. 

Court Decision on Smith 
Will Hurt University 

Student government in the University of California faces drastic 
change in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision to let stand the 
Califomia State Supreme Court's ruling on Smith v. Regents. The 
state court ruled that mandatory student fees, such as student pay-
ments to the UCSD Associated Students,. cannot be used to fund 
political groups. Until now, student governments have not acted on 
the coLirt ruling, waiting for the high court's decision. Last week's 
Supreme Court rejection of the appeal means the A.S. needs to 
scramble to figure out how to deal with the changes. 

The most pragmatic proposal at the moment involves the collec-
tion of mandatory fees for events, with the option of voluntarily 
paying more money to fund political groups on campus. This 
effectively means such political groups will receive no funding. The 
problem is deeper than students may realize, since there is no clear 
definition of political groups. The ruling may extend beyond obvious 
groups like the College Democrats or the Young Americans for 
Freedom to student organizations like Amnesty International or the 
Women's Resource Center. 

Clearly, Smith is a strike at education, since the proliferation of 
ideas should be supported by the university. A volunlary fee for the 
groups will simply not work.

Narional Comins Out Day has passed us once again. 
but not all of you brothers and sisters came out. Maybe 

attempt to reverse these recent trends through ill-
minded conditioning. But just rememeber that silly 
people do silly things. All ofthei r anger stems from fear 
of the gay lifestyle. 

you were just too busy this past Mon-
day 10 deal with it. Perbaps you had 
out-of-town guests visiting for the 
weekend, or maybe the house needed 
cleaning. 

The toughest goals are often the 
easiest to put off. Well, t~e chance 
has passed; National Coming Out Day 
has come and gone. Maybe next year 
you will think about it. 

Think again. You are only rab-
bing yourself of a wonderful oppor-
tunity. 

Besides, Coming Out Day is just 
like Earth Day; it is celebrated annu-
ally, but it is lived daily. 

Luckily, this is the '90s, and com-
ing out has become more and more 
acceptable than in the '20s, '50s or 
even the ' 80s. 

No longer does the psychological 
community deem homosexuality a 
mental ilIness- in 1973, the Ameri-
can Psychological Association re-
moved homosexuality from its "black 
list." 

No longerdo the police and judical 
systems consider homosexuals an im-
moral segment of society. San Diego 
has the best aay-friendly police de-
partment of any large city in the coun-
try. 

In addition, gays and lesbians 
throughout the nation are winning 
cases concerning rights issues rang-
ing from touch dancing at Disneyland 
to raising children with same-sex 
spouses.

Homophobes like Pat Buchanan

Your best bets in getting stalted 
on the path to exual realization lie 
in bookstores and at the Center, a 
haven of support located at 3916 
Normal Street. In it, you will find a 
plethora of information, including 
literature on homophobia and on 
how to talk to your parents about 
coming out. 

The Center also provides useful 
advice on how to approach commu-
nity newspapers and bulletin boards 
for evenlS, jobs. employment and 
housi ng opportunities. 

In addition. the Center stands as 
a venue for a variety of homosexual 
and bisexual SUppOlt groups as well 
as one-on-one counseling ~ervices 
for men and women. Check out the 
groups. 

You will find that support from 
others will reduce your isolation 
and make the process of coming out 
easier. 

While you are there, get a listing 
of bookstores and browse around 
the place. There is a lot of informa-
tive and enlightening material avail-
able. 

A book highly recommended by 
many in the gay community is Lov-

at least a dozen gay or gay-friendly churches in San

UNMASK I NG TH E: FACE OF HOMOPHOBIA 
By ErIc Schmidt 
Senior Stsff Writer 

Gay and lesbian students bared it 
all in a step far more monifying than 
running nude through campus last 
Monday. They removed the mask of 
heterosexual nonnality, openly fac-
ing a world which can be hate-filled 
and violent toward gays. Such cour-
age is respected even by those who 
hate gays. 

The people who boldly claim to 
be gay on National Coming Out 
Day should ideally be met with in-
difference and should not merit spe-
cial treatment. Gay people should 
be able to walk up to the micro-
phone and bellow, "I'm gay," while 
passersby yawn orthink ''that's nice" 
or shout back, "I'm straight." 

After all, since there is no funda-
mental difference between gays and 
strai2hts, it seems reasonable that 

CLOSET: 
Overcoming the 
Label 
ContInued from ..... 4 

For many, coming out of the 
closet of homosexuality means tak-
ing on the "Label." No doubt, it can 
be a frustrating maUer. 

When one takes on a label that 
many people acknowledge as a Sle-

frustration occurs because 

gays should get the same reaction as 
heterosexuals who shout out that 
they are straight. But open-minded 
people who react indifferently to 
Coming Out Day are indirectly per-
petuating homophobia. By ignoring 
the problem of homophobia. igno-
rance and harred become even more 
embedded in heterosexual culture. 

Most Americans are at least 
slightly homophobic - admitted 
gays are met with disdain by many 
of those around them, even if that 
disdain is unconscious. Nearly ev-
eryone has some son of reaction to 
those who are openly gay. I have 
known gay people who look down 
on other gays. believing themselves 
to be freaks of some sort. 

Even those who claim not to be 
homophobic react in some way to 
gays. Just watch the interest the topic 
sparks at any gathering of rehilively 

of the exchange of false generaliza-
tions, such "all gay men are flam-
boyant." 

While generalizations may hold 
some !Nth in certain circumstances, 
they are often false for the majority 
of those labeled by them. So to be 
afraid of the label is really to be 
afraid of those who are misinformed, 
prejudiced and/or biased. Do not let 
these people keep you from coming 
out.

ings, even if those involved are rela-

It may seem reasonable not to 
give gays special attention, but that 
is just an e8$Y way out. Indifference 
has become as much a barrier to 
equality for gays as the preaching of 
self-righteous moralists. 

Just take a look at legislation

unsure of your friends' reactions, 
think about this: should you respect 
them as your friends if tbey are so 
easily turned against you and your 
individual lifestyle? 

You will find thar coming out 
has its advantages, one of which is 
the so-called "Filter Effect." Those 
who do not really like or love you 
get filtered out of your life. What a 
service ! Your circle of friends will

proposed in Oregon and passed in 
Colorado which deny special equal-
rights protection to gays. These laws 
don't discriminate directly, butthey 
silently condone homophobia by al-
lowing it to persist relati vely un-
punished. 

Granted, laws such as those are 
heavi Iy pushed by conservati ve mor-

a�ists' but they are passed by groups 
that are not openly homophobic. 
Many of the bills' supporters don ' t 
believe gays are significantly dif-
ferent than straights and should re-
ceive no special protection. The bills 
they promote. however. arediscrimi-
natory. 

The pervasiveness of 
homophobia in America cannot si m-
ply be ignored. When homophobia 
is not dealt with openly, ignorance 
of gay issues simply increases ha-
tred. For example. gays served in 

will be of the same calibre as your-
self. 

The greatest advantage of com-
ing out, however, is that you can 
become whole. 

Acknowledging this missing 
piece of your life will help in the 
process of completing your true 
identity. 

The great amount of pressure that 
comes from lies, concealment and 
fear will be lifted off your shoul-
ders. This should motivate you to 

the military for years silent and un-
noticed. When they tarted to come 
out, they found themselves sudden 
victims of an ignorant establishment. 

Most people I know who hate 
gays don' t know any and have never 
talked to any. 

When confronted with their big-
otry. homophobes stutler and 
stumble, but they can',! give a real 
reason for their hatred. When gays 
speak openly about being gay. they 
whittle away at homophobia. It be-
conles clear that the ignorant rheto-
ric of Bible-thumping moralists is 
far more repulsive than the sodomy 
they despise. 

Supporting those who are com-
ing out of the closet is crucial. Those 
who survive the often difficult step 
of publicizing their sex lives help 
the gay community to become more 
accepted in society.

6 OPINION The UCSD Guardian Thursday, October 14,1993 

JIM STEPHENS AI J1EGES ·MISCONDUCT AT THE cHE CAFE 
EdItor, 

After contacting the administra-
tion about numerous material viola-
tionsoftheMemorandumofUncIer-
standing (MOU) by the C~ Caf~ 
this past summer, they suggested 
that the ASUCSD would best repre-
sent the students by giving a fair 
hearing. 

I was very disappointed. Rather 
than assessing the situation, my judg-
ment was attacked at the very out-
set. It seems that the MOU is quite a 
fragile document. Carla Tesak. the 
president of ASUCSD, began by 
lecturing that any material violation 
of the MOU required proof. This 
was rather insincere. since she had 
never been receptive to all my in-
quiries. 

I spent the better part of August 
trying to track Carla down, from 
unanswered telephone calls to ig. 
nored letters detailing a very dan-
gerous situation at the Che and out· 
lining the potential risk faced by the 
students and the university. Nearly 
two months after the fact, it now 
seems clear that Carla is intent on 
squashing all debate of the matter 
using constitutional means and sug-
gesting that my charges were un-
founded. 

Further. I was assured by Wally 
Lockwood, chair of the Oversight 
Committee, that he had read the 
nearly 30 pages of documents that I 
had proffered. Later it was revealed 
that the most salient document, a 
letterdated Sept. 7 to Lynne Peterson 
detailing eight violations in mate-
rial and spirit of the MOU, was 
overlooked - he only had vague 
knowledge of its contents. 

Finally, Chloe Burke, a person 
intimately involved in the drafting 
of the MOU, suggested in a rather 
threatening tone that I "had better 
come up with" proof of a material 
violation of the MOU orelse I would 
be wasting the time of this (fine) 
commiuee. 1be fact of the matter is 
that both Lockwood and Burke are 
more intent on protecting their own 
limited interests, covering up viola-
tions and making sure that the MOU 
is DOA. 

A case in point. The e~ Caf~ 
knowingly put on an uninsured punk 
rock concert on Sept. 2. 1993. fea-
turing the band Three Mile Pilot. I 
have a video of that concert includ-
ing the aggressi ve nature of the non-
students using university property 
to put on a performance. The 
ASUCSD chose in a furtive fashion 
to "waive" enforcement ofthe MOU 
in this instance and cover up its own 
lack of oversight. 

If you. as a student of UCSD. 
have not heard of the Ch~ Caf~. it is 
probably because: 

I. It has been privatized by non-
students who use the place to satisfy 
their own Ii mited and careworn "po-
litical" agenda. 

2. If you do have the urge to eat 
vegetarian food on campus this year 
you had better sa ve your appetite or 
go off-campus. The non students at 
the Che Cafe who use the place as an 
apartment or hangout haven't found 
the ti me to open for regular business 
hours in spite of their numbers. 

3. If you have heardoftheCh~, it 
is probably due to their history of 
health code violations. The police 
also detained an indivldual sleeping

at theChe during non-business hours 
who had over 10 outstandin..8 war-
rants for arrest and had been ac-
cused of stealing from the Che. 

There is a proposal to make the 
Che Cafe a vegetarian restaurant 
run by former UCSD students and 
employing current students of 
UCSD. All the "profits" after wages 
would go into a scholarship fund to 
attract needy students to UCSD. Fur-
ther' this entity would work in con-
junction with an established local 
charity to assist in feeding the home-
less. You' ll never get that proposal 
from co-ops, those guardians of 
student rights. Rest assured, you'll 
hear from them when they need 
money and drum up the old persecu-
tion complex that the administra-
tion is trying to close them down. 
Finally. you'll never get it from the 

ASUCSD, those elected to repre-
sent the students. They're hard at 
work covering up problems that 
occurred over the summer. 

I am bringing this to your atten-
tion as a former core member of the 
C~ Caf~ who witnessed this trav-
esty firsthand. I have never collected 
a dime of pay in spite of hundreds of 
hours of work at the CM, and I set up 
a program to give my food credit at 
the Ch~ to needful students and the 
homeless. The ad hominum attacks 
and personal threats against me have 
already begun, an effort revealing 
the only collective action they are 
capable of - self-preservation. 

Jim Stephens 

EdItor, 
I was extremely disappointed by 

the article on the Ch~ Caft! that ap-
peared in Monday's Guardian. 
Hopefully, more will come to light 
in the second part of the story, but 
the first half was a joke. The article 
portrayed the image that Jim 
Stephens accused the Che of violat-
ing the Memorandum Of Under-
standing without evidence and is 
"simply out to destroy the co-ops." 

This is simply not true. First. Jim 
has been trying to give evidence 
through the proper channels for the 
past month, but no one seems very 
interested in dealing with the prob-
lems at the Che. Not one person 
returned his calls or correspondence 
asking to see the evidence or even 
just to talk about the problems. And 
now the co-ops "de~and" proof. 

'. 

Have any of them taken the time to 
find out what is really going on? 

Now, about the issue of Jim try-
ing to "destroy the co-ops." Lynne 
Peterson failed to mention that in 
his article Jim took the time to try 10 
stop the Three Mile Pilot concert at 
the Che after it had lost program-
ming insurance. It does not take a 
genius to realize that if anyone had 
been hurt at that show and sued the 
university. then all the co-ops would 
go down. Why should the co-ops 
suffer for the carelessness and dis-
regard of the Che? The co-ops are a 
wonderful entity. butthe Che is pull-
ing them down by putting the whole 
organization at extreme risk. 

The article also says that "the 
oversight committee will decide [if 
the Che collective is] operating in 
the best interest o(the students." 
Well, this committee pardoned the 
Three Mile Pilot concert in which 
the university could have been li -
able. How can a costly lawsuit be in 
the "best interest of the students?" 
Who eventually pays al l those bills 
and suffers the consequences? The 
students, of course. 

And what is the point of having a 
Memorandum of Understanding if 
it can be breaChed and parC\.oned at 
will?This type of behavior gives the 
idea that it is a worthless document. 
The co-ops spent three hard years 
hammering out thi s agreement 
which should be treated with at least 
a little integrity. [ hope the second 
part of this story is more informa-
tive on the problem. The reader 
deserve to know all parts of it.

According to UC Vice Presi-

Hirschman, under realistic sce-

"could get an increase of three or 
four percent a year, but we need 
.seven or eight percent to keep our

to $141.9 million. 

"The university is basically say-
ing that if the state funds don't 
come through then the student fee 
is going to be raised qain to fill 
the gap," Emerick said. 

UC PresidentJack Peltason said 
that this fee proposal is necessary 
to "prevent further erosion inquaJ-
ity" of the UC system while main-
taining accessibility, 

"We are striving to keep the 
University of California accessible 
to all qualified students," he said. 

In an Oct. 7 press release. 
Peltason said that there are cur-
rently very few options besides 
raising fees to bridp the alp be-
tween what the university needs in 
funds and what it will receive from 
the stale. Accordin, to PeltalOn, 
this is "essentially a short-term 
solution, and what California ur-
gently needs is a Ionl-term an-
swer to the problem of financinl 
hiaher edUQtion." 

Of this increue, $75.3 million 
will 80 toward a five percent sal-
ary increase for UC facuhy and 
staff, who had their salaries cut 
lut year. This five percent boost. 
equal to theamounttbat llatewort-
en will ~ve next year, is parlof 
the university's policy to request 
raises based on salaries at compa-
rable institutions. 1be proposaJ has 
drawn criticism from both students 
and members of the California 
Legislature. 

In a letter addressed to Peltason 
and California State University 
President Barry Munitz, four state 
assembly members, including 
Committee on Higher Education 
Chair Marguerite Archie-Hudson, 

probably going to need more 
money from the state, students 
are going to have to pay a greater 
share [and] we need to look for 
new efficiencies," Hirschman 
added. 

ue Provost Walter Massey 
agreed that "students will have to 
do more." 

Regent Roy Shults called stu-
dents the only stable element in 
the funding of California higher 
education. According to Shults, 
the philosophy of the university 
used to be, "if we build it, they 
will come." Now, Shults sug-
gested, it is also true that "if we 
keep it, they will come." 

The UCSD Guardian 

Shults said that the best way to 
preserve quality is a high-fee, 
high-aid policy, in which fee hikes 
are offset by adequate, need-based 
financial aid. There were, how-
ever, indications at the meeting 
that other regents were reluctant 
to support a long-term fee policy. 

The meeting concluded with 
CSU Trustees Chair Anthony 
Vitti suggesting that the two 
boards meet jointly on an annual 
basis to coordinate their strate-
gies. 

California State Student As-
sociation President (CSSA) Wil-
liam Moton noted that the joint

~erick said that the UeSA 
opposes these salary restorations 
if the money is coming from stu-
dent fees andIorstudent programs, 
as is expected. 

"If there aeeds 10 be a fee in-

proposed fee increases and con-
centrate on working with the stu-
dents and legislature to ..... develop 
comprehensive budget solutions

are unnecessary. 

Executive Lobby Director for

line its budgets like other busi-
nesses by estimating its budget for 
the year and then making cuts as 
necessary to balance it. "The uni-

"I think it's absurd that even 
thoup they're expectinJ an in-
c:rase from the stale, they're still 
talkilll about raising student fees." 
A.S. Vice President of External 
Affairs Nick Endres said. 

"This is indicative of the lack 
of respect the university has for 
student needs," he added. 

Presently, UC programs are 
operating with 5341 million less 
in state money than in 1990-91. 
"We are doing more with less; we 
are educating all eligible students 
who choose to come, faculty are 
teaching more and we are graduat-
ing students in larger numbers then 
ever before," Peltason said. 

"But I must add that if the bud-
get-cutting trend of the last few 
years continues. it will take de-
cades to recover," he said.

Berkeley Physics Professor Calls for Emergency Budget Plan 
BUDlET: Schwartz 
releases sixth report on 
university spending 
By Jonna Palmer 
Associate News Editor 

UC Berkeley Physics Profes-
sor Emeritus Charles Schwartz, 
who has investigated the Univer-
sity of California's budget over 
the past year, has released another 
report criticizing the university'S 
spending habits. 

In a series of reports issued 
during the past year, Schwartz 
outlined the spending habits of the 
UC system. His first report, issued 
in December of last year, looked at 
the expenses of the UC General 
Counsel and concluded that $ \0 
million could be saved in that pro-
gram alone. Further investigations 
detailed savings possibilities in the 
UC medical schools and hospi-
tals. 

Schwartz's sixth and latest re-
port, issued Oct. I , "presents an 
Emergency Budget Plan for the 
University of California, designed 
to rescue this institution from the 
downward spiral produced by the 
recent budget policies of the UC 
administration." 

He suggests that under his plan, 
the university could reduce stu-
dent fees by $1,000, give faculty a 
10 percent pay raise and cancel the 
third early retirement incentive 
program. 

The 10 percent pay raise would 
be in additi'on to the general pay 
raises already recommended by 
UC President Jack Peltason in his 
proposed 1994-95 budget. Further-
more, Schwartz's plan calls for no 
more fee increases for the next 
two years, 

Schwartz estimates the total 
cost of this emergency plan to be 
anywhere from $205 million to 
$255 million. He based his calcu-
lations on public documents pro-
duced annually by the central ac-
counting and budget offices of the 
university. 

The report also recommends 
ways to pay for the plan through a 
variety of cost-cutting measures 
within the ue system. 

In his second report, Schwartz 
estimated that, with regard to ex-
cess administrative bureaucracy, 
"something of the order of $250 
million in current annual spend-
ing was unnecessary and could be 
cut." 

However, in his latest report, 
he suggests that immediate cuts 
leading to a savings oU80 million 
are all that would be necessary for 
his budget plan to succeed. 

Schwartz recommended cutting 
executive salaries by 25 percent, 
which would 'save $ \0 million, 
and taking $75 million from the 
profits ofUe system hospitals and 
medical schools. 

In addition, 10 to 15 percent 
surcharges would be placed on out-

Professor Emeritus 

side business incomes such as the 
UC Extension Program, adding up 
to another $20 million in savings. 

Unrestricted funds used for 
construction projects could be 
taken back from areas such as 
building funds in order to save an 
additional $100 million. 

All of these savings, according 
to Schwartz, add up to at least 
$385 million, much more than the 

minimum amount necessary for 
his Emergency Budget Plan. How-
ever, as he writes in the latest 
report, "None of this money comes 
free. The champions of those sec-
tors of the university which are 
being asked to give up some of 
their cash will argue their need to 
keep it. The rest of the university 
- which is now suffering the brunt 
of the budget cuts - will have to 
argue that their needs are greater." 

Initial attempts to present his 
findings to the Board of Regents 
received little attention, Schwartz 
said. 

Schwartz added that he wanted 
to sit down with Peltason and his 
staff to discuss the budget crisis. 
"That' s not a procedure the presi-
dent likes. He used to reply to my 
letters - he doesn ' t do that any-
more," Schwartz said. 

Schwartz has been attending 
regents' meetings with his reports 
and has occasionally been given a 
few minutes to speak. In his latest 
statement to the UC Board of Re-
gents in September. he addressed 
the issues of the quality of and 
access to a UC education , prin-
ciples that he indicated have been 
seriously damaged by the recent 
budget decisions. In the address, 
he went on to say that the downfall 
of these principles may well lead 
to "wrecking the Uc." 

Schwartz defined quality as 
"the outstanding scholarly talent 
of the UC faculty" and access as 

the right for "all academi cally 
qualified students [to] get an edu-
cation at UC, regardless of their 
financial circumstances." 

According to Schwartz. the re-
gents' reaction to his reports has 
been to simply ignore them. He 
said he does not harbor a great deal 
of hope for the financial fu ture of 
the university. 

He said that not only do stu-
dents, faculty and other ci tizens 
need to become concerned and do 
something about the budget, but 
the whole budget process needs to 
be changed. 

"Clearly certai n interests are 
being protected:' said Schwartz. 
noting that right now the process 
is one in which decisions are made 
in private . ' 

Schwnrtz blamed a lack of me-
dia coverage for the regents' f<lil -
ure to respond to his reports. Ac-
cording to Schwartz, student gov-
ernment has also remai ned fairly 
si lent on the i sue. "The on ly way 
to get anywhere is to make noise 
about it," Schw<lrtz said . 

Schwartz said that he wi ll con-
tinue to in vestigate budget iss ues 
and ways of saving the UC system 
money until so meth ing is done 
about it. 

" [The uni versity is] on the one 
hand a public corporation , on the 
other hand a private pl antation. 
The sad thing is there's so little 
public di scourse about these is-
sues," he said.

Paper Recycling Added to Campus 
By He.ther MeR •• 
Guardian Reporter 

Throughout campus, sludents 
can now find bins marked for white 
and colored paper recycling thanks 
to the Environmental Recycling 
Company and Kevin Lyons, who 
have placed these bins on campus 
in order to help San Diego de-
crease the amount of recylable 
trash. 

As mandated by Assembly Bill 
939, San Diego must divert 50 
percent of the waste presently go-
ing into its landfills into recycling 

REGENTS: 
Students also hold 
joint meeting 
ContInued from pap 7 
meeting of the regents and trust-
ees came at the same time the 
CSSA had completed ajoint sum-
mit with the University of Cali-
fornia Student Association. 
Moton said that these joint efforts 
will give students a stronger voice 

by the year 2000. 
"We want to help San Diego 

meet Ihal goal," Lyons said. 
The Environmental Recycl ing 

Company has placed its recycling 
bins at other universities besides 
UCSD, hospitals, businesses and 
companies throughout San Diego, 
according to Lyons. , 

Over the course of one year, the 
Environmental Recycling Com-
pany, a non-profit organization , 
takes in over 1,500 tons of white 
paper waste. Every month, it takes 
in over 200 tons of recyclable pa-

in the budget process and in the 
changes within higher education. 

Student Re gent Darby 
Morrisroe said she was mildly 
frustrated because the meeting 
"could have gone a lot further to 
defining an institutional re-
sponse." Morrisroe said that the 
greatest benefit of the joint meet-
ing was that it served as "an outlet 
to let people understand the tough 
choices we're facing and how dire 
the situation is." 

u C S D 

per, and for every ton of paper it 
collects, 17 trees are saved, Lyons 
said. 

The paper recycl ing bi ns are 
localed in Mac's Place, the Guard· 
iall office, the Grove Caffe, most 
adm inistration offices, the A.S. 
Media Center and several other 
locations around campus. 

" I want to emphasize that the 
bins are out there, and what a posi-
tive thing this is for the campus to 
get involved in," said Lyons, 
whose family has been in the recy-
c ling business for over 30 years. 

According to Morrisroe, one 
important positive change i that 
the disc uss ion is "shi ft ing from 
absolute fees to afford ability" 
which she s3id is what ultimalely 
determines whether a swdent can 
pay for education. But she al so 
expressed concern Ihat the high-
fee, high-aid model put forth by 
Shults could lead to a situation in 
which high fees are imposed, but 
the state doesn ' t follow Ihrough 
with enough aid.

Plm 
The Showdown: 
4gers VB. Cowboys 

It ' s the showdown in "Big 
D." It's the game thaI sched-
ule-makers drooled over when 
Ihey created Ihe malch-up. It's 
the biggest NFL regular season 
game of the year. It's a 
rematch of last year's thrilling 
NFC Championship game. It's 
Dallas versus San Francisco. 

There isn't a single serious 
football fan who hasn't been 
waiting amdously for this 
week-seven clash to happen. 

Dallas has recovered from 
Emmit Smith's early holdout 
by winning its laslthree 
games. Troy Aikman looks 
like the best quarterback Ihe 
NFL has seen since a guy 
named Joe tip-toed on the field 
for that red and gold team that 
dominated the 1980s. 

Michael Irvin has become 
one of the premier receiving 
threats in the NFL, second 
only to that Rice guy. They 
even have Jay Novacek, one of 
Ihe league's best tight ends, 
running in fake field goals. 

Dallas has an offense that 
runs like clockwork and against 
the 4gers' shoddy defense, they 
just might e)(plode. 

Even though they have 
fallen from their glory days, 
the 4gers aren't enctly 
chopped liver. The Niner 
offense can match the Cow-
boys ' , when it's running on all 
cylinders. 

The problem is that the 
offense has had a fuel leak for 
most of the season. Injuries to 
Tom Rathman, Steve Young 
and Harris Banon have put a 
serious ding in the 4gers' 
armor. But every team fears 
this offense. 

Young kills foes with his 
wobbly passes and darting 
dashes. Rice can tum a routine 
five-yard slant into a 50-yard 
sprint. Brent Jones has never 
been covered sufficiently and 
Ricky Walters can trash-talk 
his way to 100 yards. Offen-
sively, the 4gers are capable of 
outscoring any team. 

The reason the Cowboys 
are defending Super Bowl 
champs - defense. The 4gers 
used to be a dominating team 
defensively during its champi-
onship runs, but now it 's an 
inexperienced group of 
vulnerable nobodies. 

Tritons 
Tangle With 
Northern 
California 
WAtER POLO: UCSD 
finishes 3-3 at Tournament 
Sy ..... K. Hutto 
Sports Editor 

It isn't often that a Triton sports team 
gets the opportunity to tangle with the top 
Division I universities of the world 

The Stan-
fords, Cals, USCs 
and UCLAs of the 
country usually 
tend to steer clear 
of the smaller-
market UCSD-
like colleges. 

However, the 
Triton men's wa-
ter polo team 
pays no attention 
to college athlel-

ics' div isional boundries, since there are 
no separate divisions for its particular 
calling. 

Head Coach Denny Harper and his 
nationally-rapccted Triton squad have 
made their living off of dueling with the 
nation's big boys. 

Last weekend, UCSD traveled north 
to the home of the Cal Berkeley Bears for 
the prestigious annual Northern Califor-
nia Tournament to do battle with some of 
the nation's premier waterpoloprognuns. 

On Friday, the 1000-ranked Tritons 
squared off against seventh-ranked UC 
Irvine. 

Irvine jumped out 10 a quick 4~ lead 
after an uninspiring UCSD fU'st quarter 
of play. While the Anteatergoaliestopped 
everything in his line of fl/'C, UCI ex-
tended its lead to 6-0 in the second quar-

ter before the Tritons turned things 
around. 

"We had some greal scoring 
opportunites," Harper said. "But 
their goalie snuffed us." 

Finally, junior George Hegarty 
put UCSD QIl the .boIJd an4 the 
team went into halftime down by 
four. 

"I was disappointed with our 
startagains! UCl," Harpcrsaid. "We 
took alow-key approach 10 the game 
and it turned out not to be a good 
thing. [Fortunately], we didn't give 
up; we just kept hammering away." 

The Tritons matched Irvine's 
point total in the third quarter (both 
tearns scored twice) and steadily 
closed the gap in the fourth. With 
only five minutes left toj>lay,lrvine 
clung to an 8-6 advantage. 

However, just when it looked 

like UCSD could pull out the upset, 
the Anteaters nelled a crucial si)(-
on-five two-point blast. 

San Diego hung lough. counter-
ing wilh a goal of Iheir own, bUI 
promptly yielded another man-up 
two-pointer. 

''That goal deflated us," Harper 
said. "It was definitely the turning 
point in the game. We were down 
11 -7 with only two minutes to play 
and they were pressing the hell OUI 
of us. We just ran out of time." 

Despite the first-round disap-
pointmenl, the San Diego squad 
quickly rebounded to destroy 
Chaminade 16-7lalerthal same day. 

UCSDGuardian Athlete-of-the-
Week Michael Nalu led the Trilon 
scoring effort with five goals, 

"[Chaminade] was a bunch of 
guys who were sick of losing to us. 
They couldn't play with us so they 
tried to get rough. It was a very 
physical game," Harper sa id , "We 
showed a lot of poise and class [in 
nol playing their Iype of game]," 

Saturday's action included a 
rematch of last year's NCAA Tour· 
nament game, with the Tritons once 
again caging the 11th-seeded Tigers 
of Princeton, 15-9. 

Junior Mark Giul iallotti shul 
down Princeton '5 star-gunner Chris 
Elliot, and Nalu provided the scor-
ing punch with five more goals, 

net. San Diego cruised to a 14·9 vic-
tory. 

"We jumped all over them. TIlat 
was the best day so f(lr this year Ifor 
usl as far as intensity and enthusiasm. 
We pUI together fO llr sirong quarters 
of polo," Harper said. 

"We were rea lly fired lip for thi, 
game. They are our chief conference 
(Western Water Polo Association) 
rivals. We really established who was 
in control of Ihis conference." 

UCSD faced second-ranked USC 
on Sunday and swam straight into a 
brick wall of talent. The Trojans' Na-
tional A-Team members cOnlrolled 
the game th roughout, breaking the 
Trilons three-game win streak with a 
9-3 victory. 

The Tritons faced fifth· ranked 
UCLA in Ihe fi nal g3meofthe tOllma· 
ment. Afler trading goal. during the 
fi rst two quarters. the Brui ns pu lled 
away, partially because of ill-timed 
San Diego mistakes. 

UCSD converted only one or five 
man·up opportunities :\I1d h3d a cru-
cial four·meter shot blocked, The 10· 
6 loss brought the Tritons ' record to a 
respectable 11-7 on the . eaSon, 

"We h3d ach3nce to win Ihe UCLA 
game," Harper said. "We made it 
tough on them, but we didn't put 
togelher a complete fOLir quarters," 

Nalu fi nished the tourn:tment with 
25 point and gamered AII -Touma-
ment honors.

Six-time NCAA National Champwn UCSD·h,as 
a bearish bone to pick with two-time defending

. . 

C San Diego and the 
University of Wash-
ington of SI. Louis 
are undoubtedly the 
two strongest NCAA 
Divisionmwomen's 

volleyball programs in the nation this 
year, and possibly ever, 

The two teams lay claim to nine 
national championships in the 12-
yearhistoryofthe toumamenL UCSD 
Head Coach Doug Dannevik and 
Washington Head Coach Teri 
Clemens have collected more than 
700 com-
bined coach-
ing .victories. 
And the 
NCAA AII-
American roll 
call of both 
teams could fill a James Michener 
novel. 

Washington University hasbanJcd 
its way to the national championship 
game in each of the last four seasons 

_ and has emerged with three titles, in 
1989, 1991 and 1992. 

set by second-ranked Juniata Col-
lege. 

The loss snapped an NCAA AII-
Division women's volleyball record 
of 59 straight wins and a Division UI 
record of 77 victories in a row. Need-
less to say, the Bears are not used to 
losing. 

Clemens, who comes in with an 
equally staggering 315-53 career 
record, a winning percentage of .856, 
remains cautious about Friday's 
match. 

"We have a lot of respect for 

lightly," 

UCSD's tra-
dition and 
coaching 
ability," she 
said. "No-
body takes

Nevertheless, ClemensadmUm. 
this match is the next best thing to a 
national championship lUSCle. 

"We're not looking at it like a

block, dig, and spike each other into 
oblivion in the long-awaited grudge 
march that pits the top-ranked, two-
time defending national champion 
8eaB against the third-ranked Tri-
tons in the UCSD-hosted Mizuno In-
vitational Tournament. 

This could easily be the biggest 
regular-season volleyball match in 
UC San Diego history. If ever there 
was a game that cOllld raise the eye-
brows of volleyball enthusiasts 
throughout the country, this is the 
one. 

"It 's got all the eannarksof a first-
class event that people can really sink 
their teeth into," Dannevik said. 

Dannevik has had his share of big 
games during his 15-year tenure at 
San Diego, With six national titles, 
four second-place finishes and an in-
credible 390 career victories under 
his belt, Dannevik has earned na-
tional respect as one ofthetopcoaches 
in Div ision IfI history. 

UCSD's mediocre overall record 
of 9-7 can be misleading. As in sea-
sons past, Dannevik has packed the 
Tritons' 1993 schedule with highly-
touted and extremely-competitive 
NAIA. Division I . Division II and 
top-conference opponents. 

The telling statistic is that the Tri-
tons are an almost perfect 9-1 against 
their Division III counterparts ~o far

There will be some key individual ' 
matchups to watch out for, 

Last season, the Bears had five 
players named to the All-American 
tearn, and four of them have returned 
forthe 1993 year. They include junior 
outside hitter Amy Albers, junior 
middle blocker Amy Sullivan, senior 
setter Leslie Catlin, and sophomore 
outside hitter Anne Quenette. 

This yea(s Triton squad. with only 
, two seniors on the roster, is the young-

est team that Dannevik has ever 
coached. 

Last year, for the first time in 10 
years, UCSD did not have any players 
named to the prestigious Ali-Ameri-
can team. 

In fact, the 1992 UCSD women's 
volleyball squad did not even have a 
player named to the AII-West Region 
team. 

111e squad is led this year by AII-
American candidates julie Harvey, a 
j unior outside hitter. Laura Kranz, a 
sen ior outside hitter. tlnd Amy Crotty, 
a sophomore setter. Senior olllside

WOMEN'S SOCCER: Tritons massacre Southern California College ~_rvs,

Senior Staff Writer 

That smoke rising from the North 
Campus fields Wednesday afternoon 
was from the ashes of what once was 

the Southern Cali-
fornia College 
women's soccer 

tearn after UCSD 
(8-0-1) scored 
~ ~OIIClJ!lclwns 
and 1~0 extra 
points on their 
way to a 14-0 
obliteration of the 
Lady Vanguards, 

Southem Califomia, in its fIrSt 
season of soccer, has been getting 
hammered all year long, and the Tri-
tons were more than happy to take 
advantage ofthe Vanguards' inexpe-
rience. 

The game was scarcely eight min-
utes old when Triton Michelle 
Carbone launched a comer kick from 
the right side. The blast sailed over 
teammate Diana Muchowski and out 
in front of Vanguard goalkeeper An-
drea Oleson. who ended up knocking 
the ball into her own net in the ensuing 
struggle forcontrol.lt was going to be 
a very long &y for Oleson, 

promptly f!fed a shot from 12 yards 
out past the Vanguard keeper. 

Less than 90 seconds after the 
second goal, UCSD struck again on a 
comer kick. This time Carbone con-
nected with Muchowski, who tapped 
it to fellow Triton Carin Pugh, who 
knocked it in. 

UCSD had to wait almost two full 
minutes for its next score on yet an-
.r comer k.il;k. Again i& loYaa 
Carbone to Muchowski, who look it 
herself this time and beaded the ball 
into the net 

Kingsbury, Pugh and Christa 
Wemmer, respectively, finished out 
the scoring in the first half, and after 
45 minutes the score was 7-0 and the 
Lady Vanguards had yet to conttol 
the ball past midfield. 

Katie Larlc.in started up the scoring 
eight minutes into the second half, 
when she brought the ball near the top 
of the box, took one step away, and 
rocketed a left-footed shot thai sailed 
over the beleaguered Oleson, For 
Oleson, it was not a good outing -
the crossbar and goalposts were mak-
ing almost as many saves as she was, 

Ete Johnson scored twice in a row 
for UCSD off of assists from Amanda 
Jolmson and Daphne Famum, mak-
ing the score 10-0.

Tritons Wrangle Mustangs 
MEN'S SOCCEit In a very physical contest featuring 
numerous yellow cards, UCSD improves to 11-2-1 
ByKM ....... 
Senior Staff Writer 

The 70 or so fans at yesterday's 
UCSD men's soccer game must have 
felt a little left out. They were the only 

ones in the Triton 
Soccer Stadium 
who dido 'I receive 
yellow cards in 
UCSD's 2-1 win 
over TIle Masters 
College. 

In an extremely 
physical contest 
that at times looked 
more like a wres-

tling match than a soccer game, the 
Tritonsextendedtheirunbeatenstreak 
to seven games as they bumped and 
bruised their way to their II th win of 
the season. 

The Mustangs (8-3-1) entered this 
match with two consecutive 10 ses. 
From the opening kickoff, both squads 
stormed out determined to win. 

Chris Romey, always the impa-
tient one, grew tired of the 0-0 tie I I 
minutes into the game. 

Taking a long, 
high pass from 
leammate Matt 
Chilton, the se-
nior forward beat 
his defender and 
left nothing be-
tween himself 
and the goalie. 

The Mustang 
keeper had evi-
dently L seen 
Romey's work 
before and 
charged out of the 
box. The Tritons' 
leading scorer 
coolly faked the 
oncoming oppo-
nent out of his 

so he began passing out yellow cards 
like they were candy on Halloween. 

A little more than 17 minute into 
the second half, the Tritons looked 
poised to strike again. 

Romey took a pass from center 
and began dribbling up field. The 
Masters College defender, Patrick 
Smith, hadn't learned his lesson ear-
lier in the game. When Smith came 
outtoanack,Romey adroitly dribbled 
around him. A fru traied Smith pan-
icked, tripping Romey and knocking 
him to the ground. 

Smith was given the dubious dis-
tinction of a red card and ejected from 
the game. 

Romey quickly took the free kick 
and blasted a pass to leammate Roben 
Ripley streaking down the left side of 
the field. Ripley nabbed the pass and 
crossed to freshman Jay Newcomer 
carving up the middle. 

Newcomer fired u rocket over the 
head of the Mustang goalie to give the 
Tritons a rwo-goallead. 

"1 just wanted to get that ,econd 
goal," UCSD Head Coach Derek 
Armstrong said later. "I knew that 

goal wou Id kill 
the game." 

When play re-
sumed. more

followed by

the referee. The 
referee was 
happy to oblige 
but only after i.-

flfSt goal into an empty net. The goal 
was Romey's 13th of the season. 

The Masters, not wanting to let 
this one slip away early, poured on the 
pressure, Both teams attacked the ball 
aggressively, but neither squad could 
niake any progress, and the Tritons 
took the 1-0 lead into halftime. 

The game took a tum for the worse 
in the second half. Both leams upped 
the intensity, and the game became 
increasingly physical. Hard slide tack-
1es' pushing and shoving dominated.

"I think he could be a good ref," 

Annstrong said after the game, trying 
to explain the abundance of yellow 
cards, "He was just afraid of some-
thing erupting." 

The Masters managed its only of-
fensive breakthrough with four min-
utes remaining in the game. Mustang 
midfielder Daryl Topalian took a 
teammate cross pass and slid it by 
Triton goaltender Michael Madden to 
cut the UCSD lead to one.

loss of the year for UCSD against 
Division III competition (9-1). 

The visiting Tritons sputtered 
and stumbled from the beginning. 
The Tigers took advantage of nu-
merous UCSD miscues in game one 
to grab a commanding 6-0 lead, and 
went on to talee the first set, 15-1 3.

the home teams' early surge. 
Sophomore Megan Lucas came 

off the bench to spell starting setter 
Amy Crotty, boosting the Tritons 
to 15-6 victories in games twO and 
three. 

With nothing to lose, Occidental 
came out very loose for the fourth 
game, while UCSD seemed to get 
siiffer as the match wore on. 

Through the match , the Tritons 
committed 17 service errors and 
suffered from a lack of consistent

and 15-8. respecti vely, siezing the 
upset, 3-2. 

"We were completely out of sync 
from the tart," Dannevik admitted. 
"We 're going through kind of agut-
check [during the foor-game los ing 
streak] . It's fru strating for the play-
ers and for me. 

We' re a very phys ically tal ented 
team. We' re just not killing ball s. 
We ' re not putting balls away when 
we should. Right now the team isn' t 
playing well . and that's my respon-
sibility." 

Losing four straight prior to the 
biggest match of the season. this 
Friday 's contest against top-ranked 
Washington UniversityofSt. Louis, 
isn't exactly a confidence-builder. 
Nonetheless, Dannevik expects his 
team to rebound. 

"These kind of things happen in 
sports. Sometimes you just find 
yourselfin a lull. Hopefully, we can 
put this loss behind us ." 

Senior outside hitter Elizabeth 
Vesanovic again led the Tritons with 
13 ki lis and 17 digs. 

Junior Jul ie Harvey checked in 
with another strong performance, 
collecting 12 kill s and 16digs. while 
Lucas dished out 40 ass ists. 

T~;AJ, i Past Returns with Fleet Feet 
CROSS'COUNtRY: UCSD's B Team runners make strong impression at Alumni Open 

ByJe4fPra~ 
Staff Writer 

It was a day of good racing, 
great eating and reuniting with the 
past on Saturday.,when the Triton 

cross coun-
try team 
hosted the 
1JC San Di-
ego Alumni 
Open on 
campus. 

Triton s 
of old, com-
munity rac-
ing groups, 

'and of 
course th e 
'current Tri-
ton squad 

were bll ~t ~o take part in the 
festiviti~$. jhClr ... ain goal, tohave 
fun, was certain I)! acoomplished. 

For the current squad. the day 
was designed to rest the regulars 
and give runners (rom Team B an-

other shot at showing what they 
can do under pressure situations. 
Much like the Riverside meet ear-
lier this year, these runners made 
an impression . 

Jess ie Therriault, a walk-onjun-
ior, finished eighth in the women 's 
five-kilometer event with a time of 
20:42 to lead the Tritons. 

The women (71 points)couldn't 
quite grab first place, however. 
because of a strong performance by 
The Fleet Feet (20 points), a Solana 
Beach community team of runners. 

The Fleet Feet made it a clean 
sweep as they dominated the men' s 
eight-kilometer event with a scant 
48 points. The Triton men were 
fourth with 109 points. 

Individually, UCSD was led by 
the strong performances of sopho-
rr.ores Edgar Nidome and Mark 
Vargus. Nidome finished 11th at 
27:22. while Vargus used a late 
bur t of energy to finish just be-
hind him. 

Even with UCSD involved in a 
serious meet, the highlight of the 
day was reserved for the returning 
alumni and community groups who 
participated. 

Returning Triton graduates in-
cluded Dave Myers, Murk Yuen, 
Stephen Wynn. Steve Stuart. Dawn 
Africano and Tnlcy Cole-Hagan. 
Yuen showed that hec.tn still tackle 
the course by fini shing eighth in 
the men's competi ti on (27 :00). 
while Cole-Hagan finished 15th at 
22: 02 in the women' s race . 

AI 0 joi ning the fun was 
UCSD's Masters group, a collec-
tion of racers who enjoy running 
without the competiti ve .1 pect of 
cross counlry. Mick Geiskes had 
the top time with a 27: 17 finish. 

For the Tritons. thi , event 
marked the halfway point in their 
journey toward the Regionals. Life 
get back to normal this S:llurday 
when UCSDhosts the Balboa Chls-
sic al Balboa Park.

screaming in front of the UCSD goal, 
but Madden snatched the ball and the 
Mustangs' hopes of a win. 

A key to the Tritons clutch wins 
has been their stingy defense. which 
has allowed only one goal in the last 
two games. ' 

Madden stressed the importance 
of the defense after the game. "Our 
defense has been playing great." the 
goalie said. "It's a lot more comfort-
ing when you know that [the defend-
ersJ are going to do their job. It gives 
me a lot more confidence." 

Armstrong agrees that the goalie 
and the defense have improved aa-
marically in the I~ few games . . 

between first and third place was 0.2 
points." 

Team kata consists of two events: 
form and fighting. In the form seg-
ment. a thrcc-man team is judpl on a 
pre-arransed routine. The fi~ 
segment is comprised ofhead-tcHlead 
splITing.

ContInued from .... 1.1 
because their offense is their only 
defense. 

lbat'smucheasiersaidthandone. 
The Cowboy defense was the best in 
the NA..last year. The defensive line 
is a dominating wall led by Charles 
Haley, a begruntled elt-4ger. 

If it comes down to special teams, 
4ger fans had better not hold their 

SPOHTS 17 

breath. The Niners haven ' t blocked 
a kick since Ronald Reagan was 
President, and Mike Cofer is a hu-
man ulcer in cleats. Meanwhile. 
Dallas has one of the best field goal 
kickers in NFL hi story, Eddie 
Murray, who replaced Lin Elliot, 
one of the few sub-Cofer in the 
league. 

This game will no doubt be a 
war. John Madden will repeatedly 
give his traditional "Mud. Sweat 
and Blood" speech and the yoaches'

Hot off the Lollapalooza 
Tour, Rage Against the 

Machine will play 
tOTrWrrow night at 

Iguana s in Tijuana 

T he members of Rage Against the Ma-chine are still really pissed off, even 
though the band received rave review 
on the stage of Lollapalooza ' 93 and 
its self-titled album gets airplay all 
over the country. 

Drummer Brad Wilk told the 
Guardian in a recent interview that 
success hasn' t gone to the collective 
heads of the band members. "I don ' t 
think, fortunately, that it 's affected 

our views and goals. Just because we have 
fans screaming at us doesn't necessalily 

change our opin-
ions," he said. 

Though the anger 
endemic to the band 
has bee n ma i n-
tained, "It's more 
difficult every night 
to give everything 
you have to every 

single song," Wilk said. So the band, tired 
after a year on the road, took a shOll break 
before starting the tour that bring them to 
Iguana's night club in Tijuana thi Friday 
night_ Cypress Hill joins the tour in Novem-
ber_

group mixes the youthful resentment of punk

THEATER 

Damn Yankees 
Broadway-bound play is full of 

both glitz and glitches 

The Old Globe's current pro-
duction of the 1955 musical "Damn 
Yankees" is heading to Broadway 
next spring, and this has affected 
the play in a number of ways. The 
Broadway connection means 
money, and in musical theater 
terms, money means glitz, star 
value, big names and extra-special 
special effects. 

"Damn Yankees" delivers all 
of these showy elements. The sets 
and props are more opulent than 
usual , pyrotechnics spark and 
startle at various and appropriate 
intervals, and the star power is 
hung on Bebe Neuwirth, the ac-
tress who won two Emmys for her 
depiction of Lilith Sternin-Crane 
on NBC' s "Cheers." 

And while this big production 
may give local audiences a morsel 
of Broadway glamour, there is no 
escaping the fact that the six-week 
San Diego run is merely a taste 
test. Fact is, it's cheaper for New 

By John Godfrey 
Guardian Reporter 

York producers to try out material 
in the subsidized regional theater 
arena. Under the auspices of giv-
ing San Diegans a bigger, brighter 
production, " Damn Yankees" 
backers are getting a relatively 
cheap preview and an opportunity 
to work the bugs out during a low-
stakes, virtually sold-out run. 

Consequently, the production 
directed by Jack O'Brien has many 
problems. 

The Faustian story revolves 
aroundJoe Boyd (Dennis Kelly), a 
50ish man who spends more time 
watching TV and rooting for the 
hapless Washington Senators than 
he does communicating with his 
wife, Meg (Linda Stephens). After 
one particularly painful baseball 
game, Boyd shouts out that he 
would gladly sell his soul in order 
"to beat those damn yankees," the 
Senators' biggest nemesis. In-
stantly, a demon named Applegate 
(Victor Garber) appears and offers 

Boyd the opportunity to do just 
that. In exchange for his eternal 
soul, Boyd is transformed into a 
22-year-old phenomenon named 
Joe Hardy (Jere Shea) who is 
graced with the ability to single-
handedly win the pennant for the 
Senators. 

Because "Damn Yankees" is a 
musical comedy, an escape clause 
is written into the agreement. Boyd 
can leave the Senators and re-
claim his soul (and his previous 
life) ifhe leaves the team one day 
before the season ends. If he plays 
on the final day of the season, his 
soul belongs to Applegate. 

If you think the plot sounds 
incredibly sappy, it is. Like most 
pre-"Hair"musicals, "Damn Yan-
kees" is full of overblown senti-
mentality, treacly depictions of 
"true love" and a series of con-
tri ved plot developments designed 
solely to give actors a chance to

AlASKA'S PREMIER NATIVE THEATER COMPANY 

MGE. 'The 
undmytng message 
. S to ~~estion and 

~ our minds' 
C .. from lNIIe H1 
music with political, revolution-
aryJap. Wilk said. "Emotionally. 
my drums are set up to bring me to 
the point of anger ...... 

Just what gelS Rage 's goat is 
unclear in the lyrics. The words 

,question cultural. social and his-
torical norms and are charged with 
some of the same hate for author-
lI i~ that has flavored rock music 

frOll). the beginning. 
AC(;ording to Wilk. just walk-

ing out of his door onto the streets 
of Los Angele is enough to bring 
back the anger. "You see book-
ends - extreme poverty and ex-
treme wealth - in L.A .... he said. 

In addition, the structure of so-
ciety itself is fodder for Rage 's 
fire. " It's real easy to take a look at 
who 's running thi~ country. It 's 
almost all rich, white, older men 
9ictlltin,g the terms of what' sdone," 
Wilk said. 

The main point of the anger, 
though, is not just to complain 
about unfairness and stupidity. The 
lyrics are meant to poke at "facts" 
that seem relatively unquestioned 
in American society - one song 
assens that Malcolm X and Martin 
Luther King, Jr. were killed by 
officials when they attacked the 
system. 

"'The underlying message is to 
question and use your minds [to 
thinkal;Jout}everydayassumptions 
Jike bow -you live, what you see, 

wf1a~ .YO\I . wlltc:h on TV, if you 
watch TV," Wilk said. 

That sentiment is well-con-
veyed in a song titled "Bullet in 
the Head," which includes the lyr-
ics, "Believin' all the lies that 
they' re tellin ya, Buyin' all the 
products that they're sellin ' ya. 
They say jump and Ya say how 
high, Ya brain dead, Ya gona 
fuckin ' bullet in ya head." 

You can ' t hear the song unless 
you buy the album because, like 
mosl of Rage's songs, "Bullet in 
the Head" does not match Federal 
Communications Commission 
standards. 

You won't hear the final cho-
rusof"Killingin theName," which 
has been widely broadcast on the 
radio, either. Apparently, a re-
peated refrain of"Fuck you, I won' t 
do what you tell me" doesn't make 
the feds too happy. 

Rage didn't censor their own 
song, which was remixed instead 
by radio station s. When de la 
Rocha gave the finger at 
Lollapalooza to L.A . station 
KROQ for pulling the lyrics, the 
station refused to play the song. 

That was not the first time Rage 
had battled the censor. . Ina Phila-
delphia show, the musicians stood 
stark naked on center stage for 15 
minutes to express their disgus t 
for censorship. "When we tirst 
came out, people were really into 
it.. .. We wanted to take it to the 
point where people got angry so 
they would feel howwe felt" when 
songs are censored. Wilk said. 

The ploy worked, and fans 
shouted the band off the stage be-
fore they could play. ''They wanted 
to hear our music, but couldn't," 
Wilk said, hoping that Rage's 
message had gotten across. "Or 
maybe they were too drunk to give 

a shit, I don't know," he added. 
Wilk said he doesn ' t know if 

censorship has affected the b.lIld· s 
success. "It depends how you mea-
sure success. It has affected how 
our message gets out to other 
people," he sa id. He al so admitted 

. that record sales have been slight ly 
hurt. 

Band members considered tOil-
ing down their act when they 
started work on a new album, 
which may be released early next 
year. The mu sicians decided in-
stead to keep the music andmes-
sage pure, according to Wilk . The 
music will "grow organically and 
naturall y:' he said. 

The band is also working on a 
video for "Freedom" off its debut 
album. The video will attempt 10 
publicize the trial of Leonard 
Peltier, a Nati ve American activ-
ist jailed 17 years ago for a crime 
Wilk says he didn ' t cOlllmit. 

The new album wi ll include 
the track, "People of the Sun ," 
which was performed during Ihe 
Lolillpalooza lour. The ~ong fo -
cuses on the powerful l:ulture of 
the Aztecs, which de la Rocha 
maintain. Ilas Ilall u vulillity at 
leas[ eq ual 10 the conquering Eu-
ropean culture. 

Other Rage songs also take uim 
at Eurocentric notion~ . In L.A ., a 
multicultural center. everyo ne is 
"always dissing on each other's 
culture. I was never rea ll y into 
that whole vibe. We need to keep 
open minds 10 culture as well," 
Wilk sa id.

Big Head Todd andlhe Monsters 
Band represents a new breed of American rock bands 

Interview By D .. McDowell 
Senior Staff Writer 

Drummer Brian Nevin of Big 
Head Todd and the Monsters be-
lieves his band represents the "new 
surge" of American rock 'n' roll. 
Nothing could be closer to the truth. 
His down-to-earth alii tude toward 
his growing success is reflected in 
the band's approach. The trio from 
Boulder. Colorado. have found a 
new sound within rock and mas-
tered it gracefully. The band will 
open for Robert Plant Saturday 
night at San Diego State's Open 
Air Theatre. 

Gun .... : Flnt, how did 
you come across the name 
Ble Head Todd and the 
Monsters? 

When we first started off we 
played old blues and soul covers 
by Wilson Pickett and Eddie 

Vincent. Many of the old blues 
artists gave themselves crazy 
names. We are collectively called 
Big Head Todd and the Monsters. 
Todd [Park Mohr] doesn't neces-
sarily want to be know as Big 
Head and Rob [Squires] and my-
self don't want to be known as the 
Monsters. 

How .... when did you 
pt .tarted? 

Seven years ago when we were 
in high school. Todd went away to 
Colorado State University. while 
Rob and I went to the University 
of Colorado in Boulder. After a 
year Todd transferred to Boulder 
and we began playing again. mak-
ing a lillie money on the side. 
When we became a little more 
popular we released Allother 
Mayberry in 1989 on our own be-
cause no one else would do it for

How do you feel not be· 
inc from Seattle? 
. I wouldn't want to be from 

there. It is a nice city though. 
Record labels are always chasing 
trends and commercializing them. 
Boulder has recently gotten more 
attention. There are some really 
good bands from all over that just 
get lucky. 

How do feel about open· 
inc for Robert Plant? 

It is a cool opportunity. We 
have always headlined and never 
(played asl an opening act, and 
never felt we really needed [0 . We 
have been able to draw pretty well 
in most places, which is due a lot 
to radio play. We have had a couple 
of other offers but liked the idea of 
people paying less for us to play 

longer. The H.D.R.D.E. Tour I with 
Blues Trave lerl wa~ ~t!vt!ra l band 
and more focused [oward~ the hip-

anythi ng we are a rock' n' roll band. 
Zeppelin was a big intl uence so 
when we were offered the spot for 
the two weeks on the West Coast 
there was no question . 

How was Sister Sweetly 
written? 

We have a lot of materinl which 
comes from being together for 
seven years. Todd i. a prolific 
songwriter and we' ve been play-
ing much of the ~tlIfT fo r a long

ingly bland as the vixen Lola, and 
one is under the constant impres-

staging but is in fact nothing more 
than a museum rendition with a 
handful of easy, contemporary ref-
erences tossed in to give some of 
the one-liners more resonance. 

Richard Nixon, J. Edgar 
Hoover, the American Bar Asso-
ciation and the Edsel are all butts 
of new jokes, but O'Brien doesn't 
tackle the more compelling theat-
rical problem of trying to make 
this dated 1955 story seem the 
least bit interesting to a 1993 <;ludi-
ence. 

A portrait of Senator Joseph 
McCarthy_hangs on the wall dur-
ing many scenes, but this poten-
tially charged piece of decor is not 
explored at any point during the

show. Even though "Damn Yan-

anists were ' rced to consider 
"seiling ou 0 keep their careers 
alivlf. O'Brien doesn't ask us to 
consider the connections between 
that COlUeXt and the story of the 
play. Instead, the McCarthy por-
trait only tells the audience when 
the play takes place (the '50s) and 
where (Washington, D.C.). It's a 
tragic example of a wasted dra-
matic opportunity.

HEAD: Live EP 
is band's latest work 
Continued from pal. H5 
songs live and just doing them 
different ways. A lot of thought 
went into energy and flow and 
where they ended upon thealbum. 

How did It feel to record 
older sonp and put them 
with the newer ones? 

The newer songs were easier to 
record because there were no ex-
pectations. The older ones we knew 
what we wanted to do with them. 
The producer had different ideas 
and we had to merge the two. We 
were reluctant to change the vibe

from the live performances. Old 
fans will notice that they sound a 
little bit different. The texture in-
creased with more instruments. 

How do you place your-
self in the music world to-
day? 

I think we are in the new surge 
of rock ' n' roll band. I'd like to 
think we are a little different and 
hope it is valid in the industry . The 
new surge of American rock came 
off of the ' 80s synthesizer Euro-
pean rock of Depeche Mode and 
New Order, which led into U2 . 
That's why opening for Plant is 
the greatest ex perience - he is 
very much the essence of 
rock'n·roll.
