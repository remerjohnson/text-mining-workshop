SHOULD THE A.S. 
COUNCIL HAVE CLOSED 
THE GROVE CAFE?

THE ENDBy Regina IpAssociate News Editor
A week after A.S. Council first 

met to appoint the 2010-11 associ-
ate vice presidents, one of the three 
remaining positions is still unfilled — 
leaving the council to enter next year 
without a full cabinet of 10 AVPs in 
charge of managing various aspects 
of student life. 

On May 26, the council voted 
against appointing A.S. President Wafa 
Ben Hassine’s nominations for three 
AVP positions. The nominations of 
former Campuswide Senator Desiree 
Prevo for the AVP of Academic Affairs 
position, and former AVP of Local 
Affairs Aries Yumul for the AVP of 
College Affairs position were voted 
down, while the nomination of 
Eleanor Roosevelt College sophomore 
Arohi Sharma for the AVP of Student 
Advocacy position was tabled. 

On June 3, the council approved 
Prevo and Sharma to temporarily fill 
the Academic Affairs and Student 
Advocacy positions, respectively. 
They will carry out the AVP posi-
tions until Week Four of Fall Quarter 
at which point applications for the 
position will reopen. 

The position of AVP of College 
Affairs was not discussed and will not 
be filled until Fall Quarter. 

According to Ben Hassine, all 
three positions were tabled at the 
Campus Affairs committee meeting, 
which is held prior to the council 
meeting. From that, the Academic 
Affairs and Student Advocacy posi-
tions were pulled out of committee to 
be discussed at the meeting. 

Ben Hassine said the positions 
were tabled — and then voted down 
—  because councilmembers dis-
agreed with the process of choosing 
members for the selection commit-
tee. The selection committee consists 
of the president, the outgoing AVP 
and three to four council senators.

In less than two hours last night, the A.S. Council voted 17-2 to shut down the Grove Cafe, effectively ending a 24-year saga that included numerous attempts to revitalize the struggling eatery. 
The decision comes a year after the previous council voted last June 

to continue operating the coffee shop, which was $140,000 in debt at 
the time. However, despite ongoing renovations and a much-hyped 
reopening this Winter Quarter, the business has increased its debt over 
$35,000, to a total of nearly $180,000. 

According to both Vice President of Finance and Resources 
Andrew Ang and Associate Vice President of Enterprise Operations 
Brian McEuen, the Grove would need to make a daily profit of $925 to 
cover its operating costs alone. However, since reopening in January,

Over 11,000 nurses from five 
UC medical centers — including the 
UCSD medical centers — will strike 
on June 10 to protest unsafe nurse-
to-patient ratios, the National Nurses 
United announced last Friday.

“One of the things we’ve been ask-
ing is that the [nurse-to-patient] ratio 
should be maintained at all times,” 
UCSD Medical Center - Hillcrest reg-
istered nurse Janice Webb said. “We’re 
asking for break-relief nurses. That’s a 
nurse that comes in and watches your 
patient while you’re on break.”

The protest, slated to be the largest 
nurse strike in U.S. history, will also 
include an additional 14,000 nurs-
es from California and Minnesota, 
totaling 25,000 participants.

California law requires hospitals 
to maintain at least one nurse for 
every three to five patients, depend-
ing on the care the patients receive. 
The union said it wants to mandate 
stronger enforcement of these laws 
and establish safe ratios at all times. 

According to Webb, the medical 
centers do not have enough nurses to 
attend the patients.

 “We’ve been having meetings 
with hospitals that say they already 
have charge nurses, but realistical-
ly they can’t maintain the ratio on 
breaks,” she said. “A lot of times when 
the charge nurses [or nurses who 
supervise] watch, there are still more 
nurses needed — just someone to 
help out.”

However, in an online statement, 
the UC Office of the President con-
tended that such a strike is without 
legitimate cause.

“The university considers this 
action unlawful, a violation of good-
faith bargaining requirements and a 
clear violation of the parties’ con-
tract,” UCOP said in their statement.

The strike will also attempt to 
secure the nurses’ retirement benefits 
to make sure neither politicians nor 
the health industry can easily rescind 
them.

“The other thing we’re concerned 
about is the pension and our health 
benefits,” Webb said. “Things are get-
ting expensive now, and they’re trying 
to look at ways to cut costs. That’s 
going to affect people, and we want

will close its doors for good. By Ayelet Bitton

A s the clock struck 6 p.m. and the chairs around me creaked with the late arrival 
of councilmembers, my first foray in 
the world of A.S. Council officially 
began. 

The meeting began with an 
emotional public input period. The 
incoming Movimiento Estudiantil 
Chicano de Aztlan Chair, Mar 
Velez, urged the council to side 
with MEChA 
and take a stand 
against the con-
troversial Arizona 
immigration 
bill by passing a 
resolution that 
condemns the 
Arizona legislature.

Following last week’s associate 
vice president appointment drama 
— where the council tabled or voted 
down every candidate fledgling 
A.S. President Wafa Ben Hassine 
nominated for AVP positions — for-
mer AVP of College Affairs James 
Lintern offered his advice as to the 
most responsible way to decide on 
AVP candidates. 

The resolution on the Arizona 
bill returned to the forefront of 
council, with repeated objections 
voiced by former AVP Academic 
Affairs Jordan Taylor regarding the 
wording of the resolution and its rel-
evance to UCSD students. 

Campuswide Senator Victor 
Flores countered Taylor’s argu-
ments and said the resolution was 
pertinent to all students. He pointed 
out that any student at UCSD who 
would visit Arizona — Grand 
Canyon roadtrip, anyone? — could 
be stopped by police if any suspicion 
over his or her legal status arose. 
After a lengthy discussion, the coun-
cil ultimately passed the resolution 
condemning the bill.

Finally, the familiar debate over 
the Grove Cafe arose for the last 
time in its tumultuous, 24-year his-
tory. In a move parallel to last year’s 
similar debate, members spent about 
an hour debating the relative merits 
of the eatery and whether it was the 
council’s responsibility to keep the 
space open despite its thrice-failed 
business plan and growing debt.  

AVP of Enterprise Operations 
Brian McEuen 
and Vice 
President of 
Finance and 
Resources 
Andrew Ang — 
who jointly spon-
sored the legis-

lation to close the Grove —  both 
argued that the Grove would not 
cover from its nearly $180,000 debt 
and that closing the business would 
cut the council’s losses.  

The council only paused for a 
brief respite in their discussion of 
the Grove to charge a committee 
to find other business options to 
replace the area.  
Ultimately, in a decision opposite 
that from last year, councilmembers 
decided that keeping the Grove was 
not fiscally responsible and voted 
17-2 to close the business by June 30. 

Council then moved on to 
New Business, where it passed a 
resolution in support of the Iranian 
Non-Violent Student Movement for 
Democratic Reform, which affirmed 
the council’s support of the Iranian 
Green Movement fighting for human 
rights. 

As I packed my bags, I made a 
mental note to bring snacks to the 
next meeting — especially when 
food enterprises are up for discus-
sion. 

So stay classy, avid A.S. Council 
followers — I’ll see you in the fall.

the ability to negotiate with them 
when they decide.”

According to Webb, the California 
Nurses Association recently present-
ed UC medical centers with a resolu-
tion to the problem before resorting 
to a state-wide strike.

“We didn’t come up with a cook-
ie-cutter program,” Webb said. “We 
made a recommendation based on 
each unit, what type of patients 
they have. We actually had a well 
thought out plan, and we’d like to 
give it a try and enter a contract 
so that way we’d actually be able to 
enforce the plan.”

Webb said that the UC medical 
centers would benefit if more nurses 
were brought in to care for patients.

“There are all these issues they’re 
having at all hospitals in California, 
such as patients falling,” Webb said. 
“Break nurses can help out with that 
kind of stuff — the little things that 
kind of fall through the cracks when 
people are on breaks.”

She added that improving the 
nurse-to-patient ratio is a necessity 
in order to maintain quality care in 
the medical centers.

“People deserve more time to take 
a deep breath,” Webb said. “You can’t 
really work that well if you’re not going 
to have enough time to gather your 
thoughts, especially in this difficult 
field of work. You need it to give the 
patients the good care they deserve.”

UCSD Health System spokesper-
son Kimberly Edwards claims the 
medical centers do not know what 
actions they will take in response to 
the strike.

“It’s too early in the process for 
speculation, financial or otherwise,” 
she said.

NEWS� THURSDAY, JUNE 3, 2010� THE UCSD GUARDIAN 7 

the business has only made an aver-
age of $525 each day.

“I would say that the whole pro-
cess and attempt to revitalize the 
Grove failed,” Ang said. “It was a 
good effort, and there were plans, 
but at the moment there is definitely 
nothing else we can do. It’s too much 
in debt for us to really do anything 
right now.”

McEuen said the cafe was closed 
because its high debt and competi-
tion decreased the likelihood that it 
would bring in the necessary profits 
to operate sustainably. 

“We are subsidizing the Grove,” 
McEuen said. “To cover the debt, 
we would need to make over $2,000 
a day to cover our debt next year. 
With all the coffee and sandwich 
businesses on this campus, that’s not 
going to happen.”

The legislation to shut down the 
Grove — which was sponsored by 
McEuen — called for the eatery to 
officially close on June 30. In order 
to close the venue, the council must 
pay the unresolved debt with money 
from its reserve funding and other 
enterprise income. The council has 
yet to develop an official debt repay-
ment plan, but will no longer need to 
account for extra Grove expenses in 
its official 2010-11 budget. 

A few councilmembers were con-
cerned that the council’s quick deci-
sion neglects the Grove’s long his-
tory. Former A.S. President Utsav 
Gupta released a statement on the 
A.S. listserv two hours following the 
decision, condemning the council’s 
actions.

“The Grove has been a campus 
establishment for over two decades,” 
Gupta said in the statement. “The 
council moved to eliminate it in a 
little over 24 hours. There was no 
public input offered through public 
forums, I doubt anyone who worked 
at the Grove was notified, and there 
was no committee process to review 

the fiscal performance of the Grove.”
The decision to shut down the 

Grove came on the heels of the coun-
cil’s repeated efforts to make the 
business profitable. This year, for-
mer VP of Finance and Resources 
Peter Benesch and former AVP of 
Enterprise Operations Rishi Ghosh 
began plans to make over the cafe 
with renovations to the facilities, new 
equipment for the kitchen area and a 
reopening event — costing approxi-
mately $6,000 —  that offered free 
food for four days. 

“There’s some basic 
simple things that could 
be changed about the 
business model that could 
make the Grove a profit-
able, if not at least self-
sustaining business ven-
ture,” Benesch said. “For 
that reason, I argued for 
keeping the Grove open 
this past year. Myself and 
Rishi [Ghosh] put in an 
incalculable amount 
of time to revitalize the 
Grove, but the enterprise 
is still failing and there’s 
really no help for it.”

Ghosh said that, 
despite all the efforts, the 
Grove still experienced 
a significant decrease in sales that 
he believes can only be attributed 
to embezzlement or poor customer 
service.

“I cannot think of any rational 
explanation of this apart from some-
one skimming money off the top 
of the accounts to the point where 
they’re taking out a large percent of 
the money,” Ghosh said. “It’s also like-
ly that people weren’t coming back 
due to poor customer service.”

Benesch and Ghosh agreed that 
Grove’s current student-run business 
model was another major factor in 
the Grove’s failure.

“The Grove kind of operates on 
the co-op model,” Benesch said. “The 

employees feel a lot of ownership 
over the space, and that’s fantastic. I 
would have no problem with that if it 
was a self-sustaining venture, but it’s 
not. It’s a liability for the Associated 
Students.”

Ghosh added that the sense of 
proprietorship the student manag-
ers feel may have compromised their 
ability to operate the Grove as a busi-
ness.

“I would say that there’s definitely 
a reluctance from the student work-
ers to think critically about the issues 

[facing the Grove] and 
to actually reform them-
selves,” Ghosh said. “I 
think they were much 
happier without any 
sort of accountability to 
themselves or the general 
student body.”

The Grove’s lack of 
prominence on cam-
pus is represented by 
a survey councilmem-
bers conducted Winter 
Quarter, after the 
reopening. Of the 1,600 
students who partici-
pated, 42 percent said 
they do not go the Grove 
and 24 percent said they 
do not know about the 

Grove.
Ang and McEuen used these sta-

tistics, combined with the Grove’s 
decreasing sale numbers, to urge 
councilmembers to vote to close the 
cafe.

“I know a lot of people will be 
voting on what was, but please sepa-
rate from what was and look to the 
future,” Ang said. “It’s been failing 
and it’s going to keep failing. Do we 
want the debt to grow to $200,000, 
$250,000 or over $300,000? Look at it 
from a financial point of view.”

Only two council members voted 
not to close the Grove, saying that 
they hoped instead to hold off hand-
ing over the space to University 

Centers and replace the cafe with a 
new business venture.

“Our A.S. Council has the poten-
tial to grow so much,” President Wafa 
Ben Hassine said. “We are a new 
council and we have yet to see our 
potential. At least for the time being, I 
think we should hold off on handing 
over the space.”

However, the Grove’s contract 
states that its space agreement is con-
tingent upon it offering “limited food 
service.” Thus, if the council were to 
replace the Grove with a different 
business, the contract would be termi-
nated regardless.

Upon the Grove’s official June 30 
closure, the space will be returned to 
University Centers. As a part of the 
vote to close the Grove, the coun-
cil created a committee — proposed 
by Campuswide Senator Elizabeth 
Elman — to discuss potential alter-
native business ventures that could 
replace the Grove’s in its current 
location. However, such propos-
als would require approval by the 
University Centers Advisory Board 
and University Centers administra-
tors — a lengthy process that requires 
significant market research.

The committee to explore alter-
native enterprises for the Grove will 
consist of three council members, 
and will report its findings within the 
first two weeks of Fall Quarter 2010.

Councilmembers who supported 
closing the Grove said they hope to 
instead focus efforts on the A.S. store, 
which will be opening next year.

“As an A.S. and as a business-own-
ing entity, it’s fiscally irresponsible for 
us to keep the Grove,” Ang said. “We’ll 
also be opening the A.S. store next year, 
so we also have to divert our resources 
there, to an enterprise that will most 
likely be successful and one that will 
not have the financial downfall that the 
Grove has right now.”

“There was little bit of miscom-
munication that was cleared up with 
a few individuals,” Ben Hassine said. 
“A couple of the senators may have 
felt that the selection process was 
biased or unfair.”

According to current AVP of 
Student Advocacy Chris Cruz, coun-
cilmembers claimed that Ben Hassine 
formed the selection committees in 
a biased manner. They claimed that 
Ben Hassine never replied to e-mails 
requesting to serve on the selection 
committees, which lead to a loaded 
committee. Ben Hassine claimed the 
miscommunication was due to the lack 
of staff, who would have otherwise 
responded to the requests.

She declined to state the names of 
the aforementioned councilmembers 
since the meeting was closed-session, 
which means councilmembers cannot 
disclose specifics to the public. 

“None of us had staff and [the 
e-mails were sent] during the transition 
period,” Ben Hassine said. “That’s why 
a lot of the e-mails weren’t responded 
to but, traditionally, that doesn’t really 
happen.”

Ben Hassine added that disagree-
ments arose over the nominees’ quali-
fications for the position.

“Many senators felt that a closer 
evaluation of AVPs’ qualifications was 
necessary before they’re appointed their 
respective positions,” Ben Hassine said. 

For example, Sharma said council-
members preferred another candidate 
for the Student Advocacy position.

The council will reevaluate AVP 
applicants when the application peri-
od reopens during Week Four of Fall 
Quarter.

E ven if you’re not a member of Oprah’s Book Club, you’ve 
probably heard of “Eat, 
Pray, Love” — the New York 
Times bestseller that docu-
ments a woman’s yearlong trip abroad, spent traipsing in three countries and 
escaping a midlife crisis. Naturally, Hollywood recognized the novel’s matronly 
following for its cash-cow potential. Starring the talented — yet, far too beautiful 
for the role — Julia Roberts, the film promises to be this summer’s token chick 
flick. But before you dismiss it as 2010’s “Mamma Mia!” consider two things: 
Robert Richardson, the visionary behind “Inglourious Basterds,” “The Aviator” 
and “Kill Bill” is director of photography, and Javier Bardem … ’nuff said.

A lot has happened in Xtina’s life since her last release, 2006’s Back to Basics. She’s settled down with 
her manager, popped out a kid and 
become an actress.

But despite any signs of maturation, 
Aguilera’s latest is an overproduced ode 
to clubbing, boozing and boys — sprin-
kled with a few out-of-place moments of moth-
erly reflection in a return to her “Dirrty” roots. 

On slow jam “Sex for Breakfast,” Aguilera 
croons she “wants you deep inside of me,” fol-
lowed up by a 20-second interlude of her two-
year-old son imitating mom’s trademark belt-
ing. (Good thing the kid’s too young to under-
stand any noises from the parents’ room.)

Other, less-than-subtle low points include 
a botched attempt at flaunting girl power on 
adolescent anthem “I Hate Boys,” on which 
Aguilera spouts banana innuendos to a too-
common drumming beat.

In fact, even Bionic’s shining moments 
(“Elastic Love,” “Bionic”) sound a little too 

familiar, and for good reason: Aguilera co-
wrote “Bionic” with M.I.A. and collaborated 
with Santigold producer Switch on the latter 
to churn out a pair of thumping imitations — 
which almost make up for a complete lack of 
originality with sheer danceability. 

There is, however, one consistent selling 
point in Aguilera’s jumbled treatise on mother-
hood and getting laid. Xtina’s booming vocal 
range is on full display throughout, including 
on flopped first single “Not Myself Tonight.” 
By final cut “Vanity,” though, even those pipes 
can’t save Aguilera from the revelation that this 
self-proclaimed bad bitch is past her prime.

T his sounds like it was ripped off a pseudo-punk pin from Hot Topic, but I have to admit: music is my 
life. Deny it all you want, but it’s all of 
ours, really. The melancholy strums 
of Nick Drake are the soundtrack to 
grueling all-nighters; “Telephone” fuels 

weekend Four Loko binges; Dookie 
recalls that middle school punk stage 
which took too long to grow out. 

It provides the soundtrack to nearly 
every moment of our lives. Personally, 
I’ve spent hours crafting the perfect 
mix for important moments of my life. 

For my senior prom, I made the 
ultimate ‘80s playlist, just so I could 
drive around in a limo through San 
Francisco to the Talking Heads. As a 
freshman, I burned the new songs I 
scavenged from Limewire onto CDs 
for my friends. They called me “the 
Mix Master,” and it gave me a big fuck-
ing ego. 

These days I still make endless 
mixes for whatever scenario I might 
find myself in: the hazy trip to Las 
Vegas, the long, summer nights I 
spend talking to my best friend in the 
street, the windy drive through the 
back roads of my hometown. There’s 
the perfect song for every moment and 
it is my mission to find it. (Just so you 
know, for the aforementioned events 
I’d pick “Combination Pizza Hut and 
Taco Bell” by Das Racist, “Range Life” 
by Pavement and “Ocean Breathes 
Salty” by Modest Mouse, respectively.)

When music can define an entire 
portion of your life, it’s even better, 
as my fellow editors and I proved last 
weekend. Delving through the depths 
of my iPod, we uncovered the perfect 
driving songs for our perilous trek 
to the Anza-Borrego desert. Vintage 
fare was the fitting request, so my 
classic rock collection banged against 
the looming mountains as we blasted 
Bowie and gleefully belted “Ch-ch-ch-
ch-changes!” 

It didn’t stop there. After Ranger 
Sue shut down our impromptu rager 
— which consisted of blasting raunchy 
hip-hop long past quiet hours — we 
switched to beatboxing. (Nothing will 
ever top our campfire remix of “The 
Lion Sleeps Tonight.”) And when we 
discovered a giant portable speaker in 
a latecomer’s car, it was like finding an 
oasis in the barren landscape, spark-
ing an early morning dance party and 
a Beatles-fueled siesta when the heat 
proved too powerful.

As the music nerd that I am under-
paid to be, the moments I associate 
with a song are clearly significant. 
While a good conversation and the 
desert scenery flashing by as I drive 
are just as important in memory, 
music plays a vital role too. On top 
of the amazing hikes and completely 
belligerent nights, last weekend 
will always play back in my head to 
Shakira’s “Time for Africa (Waka 
Waka).” 

And I’m not the only one who 
orchestrates her life soundtrack. There 
are others out there who swoon at 
the thought of blasting “Bittersweet 
Symphony” on the open road, and 
there are certainly others who worry 
over the perfect playlist like I do. So 
own up to your obsession, geeks: I 
gave up on my pride years ago.

A s if exposing us all to the psychosis of the Joker wasn’t enough, “The Dark Knight” director Christopher Nolan wants to put us through 
some more mind-fuck. 

With “Inception,” Nolan posits us in an M.C. 
Escher world of optical illusions. City roads fold up 
like origami; buildings collapse; Joseph Gordon-
Levitt charges down a pinwheeling corridor, defy-
ing gravity. 

At the forefront of a new form of corporate 

espionage, Dom Cobb (DiCaprio) sneaks into his 
victims’ dreams, stealing coveted ideas and inven-
tions that could “transform the world and rewrite 
all the rules.” To save himself from the loveless life 
of a fugitive, he takes on one last job. This time, 
instead of filching, he must cause an “inception” 
— planting an idea in someone’s head. With such a 
confusing plot, it’s clear that Nolan won’t be giving 
us any helpful hints.

Between its cryptic title, stealth marketing 
(the first trailer was void of dialogue) and top-
secret script (the actors could only read it in 
Nolan’s office), “Inception” will be way overdue 
come its arrival on July 16.

INCEPTION TOY STORY 3
F ifteen long years after its inception, Pixar/Disney is finally releasing the third installment of the “Toy Story” 
franchise on June 18. The pressure of liv-
ing up to the recognizable film series is a 
crushing one —but the tested brilliance of 
screenwriter Michael Arndt (“Little Miss 
Sunshine”) promises a film worthy of the 
“Toy Story” name. 

Since many of the trilogy’s original 
followers are now clambering into dilapi-
dated cars headed off to college, the film 
sets its sights on higher education. “Toy 
Story 3” follows its audience’s growth as 
Woody’s longtime owner Andy sets off 
for university. A mix-up leads Andy’s 
mother to believe that the toys — except 
Woody — are garbage. Woody’s attempt to 
rescue his fellow playthings lands them in 
a daycare. Fed up with the sticky-fingered 
rampage that ensues, the gang devises a 
plan to escape the plastic-plush prison and 
reunite with Andy. 

Though the overarching separation 
anxiety is fairly typical of a “Toy Story” 
film, the nuanced nostalgia it inspires in its 
aging audience will be sure to inspire Rex-
sized tears from parents and graduating 
seniors alike. With animation that shines 
brighter than that of its 1995 predeces-
sor, “Toy Story 3” is bound to be another 
adventurous romp through Toyland, and 
hopefully will prove to be as lovable as the 
first two.

EAT, PRAY, LOVE

O ne thing M.I.A. knows is that controversy sells. To prepare for her third album, Maya, the 
superstar released a gruesome music 
video — an 8:56 minute slaughter-

fest of gingers — to accompany 
“Born Free.” A political statement, 
maybe, but so graphic it was banned 
from YouTube. Stirring up even more 
uproar, after a New York Times report-
er wrote an unflattering feature that 
claimed her political shtick was unau-
thentic, M.I.A. turned to her Twitter to 
defend herself, saying, “I’ll [be] taking 
calls all day bitches,” which was followed 
by the writer’s phone number — ouch. 

M.I.A. has described this newest 
album as “schizophrenic,” which aptly 
describes “Born Free” and “XXXO” — 
tracks dominated by chaotic beats that 
underpin M.I.A.’s breezy style. “Born 
Free,” in particular, has M.I.A. going in 
a decidedly punk direction, layering her 
rhymes with an unrelenting bass line. If 
she continues the controversy, come July 
13, people will definitely be talking about 
M.I.A. — whether the album actually deliv-
ers or not.

STARRING ADRIAN BRODY, SARAH POLLEY 
DIRECTED BY VINCENZO NATALI
RATED R
1:04

SPLICE

I n an interview with The Guardian, director Vincenzo Natali calls his sci-fi horror flick 
“Splice” “an exploration of inner 
space instead of outer space … it’s 
emotional horror.”

Unfortunately, that emotion 
leaves the audience wondering just 
where this inner-space exploration 
was supposed to be headed.  

The film follows scientist couple 
Clive (Adrien Brody) and Elsa 
(Sarah Polley) as they experiment 
with creating hybrid animals for 
medical purposes. The couple cre-
ates Dren (Delphine Chanéac), 
beginning a Frankenstein-esque tale 
as Dren rapidly grows from a small 
kangaroo/rat into a sentient almost-
human with a stinger tail.

Natali is best known for the 1997 
psychological thriller “Cube,” and 
“Splice” has moments of disturb-
ing insight that would put Freud to 
shame. But other than those scant 
instances, the characters are flat, 
bouncing between dull extremes of 
tenderness and psychosis. Elsa is the 
typical smothering mother, while 
Clive is the responsible scientist who 
spouts off about how they crossed 
a line creating Dren in the first 
place. It’s no better when they switch 
soapboxes halfway through the film; 
they’re just flat in different ways. 

The script’s tentative explorations 
of ethical questions  — like why Elsa 
would create and raise Dren — show 
that it’s trying to live up to “Cube”. In 
addition, when Clive finally under-

stands the disturbed reasoning that’s 
been going on in Elsa’s head, his 
reaction is one of the few moments 
where “Splice” lives up to the emo-
tional-horror label. 

Not to say that the film is with-
out its purported tender moments. 

“It’s really a mother-daughter 
story,” Natali said. “The primary 
relationship in the film is Elsa and 
Dren.” 

That dynamic would have 
come through a little more if 
“Splice” took the time to estab-
lish such details. Instead, viewers 
are railroaded through a series of 
abrupt revelations: Elsa had a bad 
relationship with her dead mother. 
Aforementioned dead mother had 
a farm. Clive and Elsa need to hide 

Dren from their company.
The movie’s full of faux emotion-

ally charged moments, like Clive 
trying to drown an already choking 
Dren and — surprise! — it turns 
out Dren can breathe underwater. 
Elsa, thinking he saved their pseudo-
daughter from choking to death, 
asks, “How did you know?” Clive 
just shrugs, and that’s about all you 
can do too. 

“Splice” does have moments 
where it goes deeper than the sur-
face. In the end, the characters don’t 
have any more depth than before, 
but the effect is so bizarre that it sets 
“Splice” apart from other creature 
shockers.

ARCADE FIRE
THE SUBURBS

Y ou’re walking through an inde-pendent record store, flipping idly through some 12-inch singles, 
searching for the obscure artists your 
hipster heart desires, when — all of a 
sudden — you stumble across a sleeveless 
record, blank except for one very impor-
tant band name. It’s the new single from 
Arcade Fire. You have just struck gold. 

That’s exactly how the Montreal 
band has packaged the new tunes from 
their forthcoming LP, The Suburbs. 
When the first record turned up at a 
shop in Glasgow, 
the Internet 
exploded with 
buzz over the 
new tracks, 
and inevita-
bly, the single 
and B-side — 
“Suburbs” and 
“Month of May,” 
respectively — have been leaked.

“Suburbs” is typical Arcade Fire fare: 
Slow, melodic piano builds over the gen-
tle strum of acoustic guitar as frontman 
Win Butler spews his best imitation-
Springsteen lyrics about growing up in 
the heartland. Meanwhile, “Month of 
May” offers a curiously aggressive rock 
sound — more befitting Queens of the 
Stone Age than the reserved Arcade 
Fire. It seems strange, but hot damn, it 
actually works.

Still, compared to the moments of 
pure brilliance on their previous record-
ings, the new tracks don’t quite measure 
up. Then again, it’s a hard task to follow 
two nearly perfect albums; let’s just hope 
The Suburbs has a few more gems in 
store.

EDITOR IN CHIEF�t�."/"(*/(�&%*503

H alf a decade ago, on Wednesday of Week 10, I was already dreaming 
of this day: The Last Production. 
Outgoing Guardian pillars like 
Grant, Vlad, Ian and Cody — 
gods in my eyes — were drowning 
their seniorities in some Arrogant 
Bastard while I sat miserable in 
my fugly attempt at a Summer 
Movie Preview design. I bush-
whacked blind through a first-ever 
round of edits; meanwhile, then-
Hiatus Editor Cody blasted SoCal 
pop-punk (the Bouncing Soles, 
who still hold a special place in 
my iPod) and proceeded to get so 
sloshed he barely got his album 
review in before dusk.

My only consolation was that, 
one day, it would be me in the 
party hat.

It’s tradition: The restless crew 
of outgoing seniors is supposed 
to get drunk and stumble around 
the office the last day, jeering 
the incoming editors until they 

regret the day they decided to 
apply. I wish I could sit back and 
savor their pain with some fine 
boxed wine. But my state of sober 
(sort of) stress today is a testa-
ment to the over-involved, often 
psycho grip with which I run the 
Guardian. For the good of every-
one, it’s my time to move on.

All through Fall Quarter, there 
was a knot of worry in my gut 
that UCSD’s official newspaper 
wouldn’t be equipped to uphold 
its history of greatness next year. 
About one month after meeting 
incumbent Editor in Chief Angela 
Chen, though, it had disappeared 
completely. Angela: Because of 
you, I will be able to take on my 
future without looking back with 
fear or regret. You never deserved 
an eye-roll— not even once. You’re 
the most open, honest learner I’ve 
encountered at this school; you lis-
ten, you’re never overconfident or 
defensive, and you ask questions. 
For that, you will be rewarded 

with skill. Guaranteed. Keep keep-
ing it real, and come 2013, you too 
could be spraying Four Loko off 
the hood of your Corolla in the 
7-11 parking lot.

To the rest of the incomers: 
Your work this quarter has sur-
passed my wildest expectations. 
Hayley: You’re the strongest writer 
on staff. Read more Esquire, and 
you’ll be downright bomb. Arielle: 
You’re an angel, and you know 
your shit. Keep my baby classy. 
Neda: Focus, but never let go of 
Hiatus — it suits you. Cheryl: 
You’re the glue, and that’s every-
thing. Take more photos, but 
demand more massages. Regina: 
You surprise me every day. Keep 
it up. Liam: You’re my favorite. 
Especially for standing up to us 
when we’re assholes. Masha: I 
never thought strict could be so 
sweet. Enforce the schedule like 
I never could. Melody: Have fun 
with that shit. I secretly want your 
job. Trevor: Come

M y time at the Guardian has been somewhat of a real-life nightmare. In my four-
year career as a writer and editor, I 
have endured far too many Redbull-
fueled all-nighters, faced countless 3 
a.m. disasters and lived beneath the 
rainy cloud of a perpetual deadline. 
In fact, the only time I’ve ever really 
been able to escape the G is when I’m 
asleep. But like I said, I don’t sleep 
very often.

Still, as I reminisce about my 
monotonous academic career at 
UCSD, it was usually the only good 
reason to be awake in the first place. 
Not to rag on all my lit/writing cours-
es, but the terrifying gaze of 20,000 
undergraduate eyes sort of scared 
me into improvement. Instead of a 
comfy workshop circle to test out my 
ideas, there was just a crowd of ruth-
less twentysomethings ready to say 
“You suck.” So thanks, even if you’re 
the most noncommittal Guardian 
reader — my fear of your judgment 
has made me better at my job.

The way I see it, if it weren’t for 
this paper, I would still be writing 
bad poems in my Moleskin, waiting 
to graduate so I could move on to 
undefined bigger, better things. The 
Guardian has taught me to live in 
the moment in the most intense way 
possible — even if that means letting 

other parts of my life fall apart. 
 Besides maybe inserting the word 

“poopy” into an editorial a couple 
weeks ago, I have no regrets. I know 
what’s important to me now, and 
that’s all I ever really wanted from 
college. I’m also guessing that, after 
thousands of hours of slave labor at 
an understaffed publication, I will 
probably never have to work this 
hard again in my life.

Now for shout-outs: Matt M., 
when I first joined, your infectious 
laugh and epic parties made me 
drool with admiration. Hadley, now 
that I’ve worked with you, I know I 
can work with anyone. Dave, thanks 
for adopting Focus when it needed 
a no-fluff parent most, and for the 
leopard couch. We still need to visit 
that beehive.

Trevor, since you survived that 
Wedge nightmare, I’ve always know 
you were one helluva trooper. Hayley, 
thanks for not quitting after I stood 
you up at 6 a.m. last year. Cheryl, I 
wish you could massage me until the 
end of time. Angela, girl, you da boss 
now — ’nuff said. Emily, I love your 
droopy office dance. Vishal, I’m mak-
ing the Jamaican horn sound for you 
as I type. Kelsey, you’re cute enough 
to rival some big-time YouTube 
kitten videos, and you’re a really 
dedicated worker to boot. Edwin, it’s 

going to be you plus me plus hot sake 
this Friday — and many NY outings 
to come. 

Sari and Shida: It might not seem 
like much, but the fact that you read 
what we write every week means 
a lot. Thanks for being the perfect 
distractions — without all those 
dance parties and delicious dinners, I 
would’ve overdosed on Guardian. 

Reza and Simone: I’ve tried not 
to spew Sun God-esque affection this 
whole sendoff, but what the hell. I 
love you guys. Reza, you’re my trusty 
coworker and friend, and I will always 
appreciate how well you handled me 
breaking your tooth. I’m going to 
miss being shady and jaded with you.

Simone, my Guardian recruiter 
and yearlong companion: There 
were many Winter Quarter moments 
where you could’ve settled for a 
slightly shoddier paper, but you never 
did, and I’ll admire you forever for it. 
No matter how much time we spent 
together, I never really got sick of you 
(that’s my way of saying you rock). 
If you ever consider launching your 
fuckup career on the East Coast, I’ll 
make sure to scope you some sturdy 
cardboard boxes. In the meantime, 
take good care of Clubby for me.

Newbies, I can’t wait to see what 
you’ve got. It’s all in your hands now. 
Make me proud.

������������������"440$*"5&�/&84�&%*503�t�$"3500/*45T here is something profoundly different about newspaper people. Resilient, unpredict-

able, dangerously curious and decid-
edly unconcerned with their own 
well-being, they are a breed designed 
for action. They work strange hours 
and harbor strange habits. They 
deprive themselves of food, sleep, 
social interaction and anything else 
indicative of a sane human exis-
tence. They admire efficiency. They 
abhor waste. They are egomaniacs 
— admittedly vain, overly ambi-
tious, disgustingly self-confident and 
completely self-aware. In private, 
they are idealists. In public, they are 
vocal skeptics, averse to the flowery 
bullshit of rhetorical activism and 
entirely unimpressed by the self-
sustaining fanfare of institutional 
politics. They are the most loyal of 
friends, the most critical of enemies 
and the most prolific of shit talkers. 
They are up-front. They are real. 
They tend to look pretty haggard 
most of the time, but they wear it 
well.

Over the last four years, I have 
had the immense pleasure of being 
surrounded by newspaper people for 
the majority of my waking moments, 
and a few too many of my non-wak-
ing moments. Though I have given 

up more than I will ever know to 
be a part of this organization, these 
people — who I am honored to call 
my friends — have made every sec-
ond entirely worth it. 

To Charles and the rest of the old 
guard (Rael, McCardle and Hadley): 
You guys took me in, brought me 
up and made me feel at home here. 
Charles, you taught me how to be 
critical of everything, and for that I 
cannot thank you enough. Rael, you 
are the chillest son of a bitch around, 
and I am confident that — had I 
never met you — I would be a con-
siderably lamer person.

To Jesse, Kim and Yelena: We 
were the news crew. I could always 
depend on you for quality reporting, 
much-needed moral support and 
cutty back-room sessions. 

To Alyssa: Although I am the 
single most talented writer in the 
world, I cannot find the words on 
Thesaurus.com to describe how 
much your friendship means to 
me. There is no one else I would 
rather have spent four years on 
the Guardian with than you. You 
were a better managing editor than 

me. Don’t let that go to your head, 
though. 

To Simone: You are something 
new — raw, unyielding, completely 
committed to the rejection of 
any and all things conventional. 
Arguing with you is like arguing 
with a tiger that coughs a lot. For 
that, I love you, and I can’t stress 
enough how great a job you’ve done 
as chief. I would sing like Justin 
Bieber if I thought it would make 
you happy. 

To Phil: You are my brother. You 
give life to the bizarre things in my 
head. You inspire me to be a bet-
ter artist. You are one of the most 
talented creative minds I know, and 
it has been an absolute joy to work 
with you this past year. And we’re 
just getting started. 

To Emily: You have never once 
failed to amaze me with the work 
you produce. I don’t know how you 
do it, but you are an endless pool 
of artistic skill and deadpan humor 
rolled into one tiny, twirling, dash-
tastic bundle of awesomeness. LOST.

To Edwin: Fuck you, bitch. You 
are the funniest motherfucker I 

know.
To Angela and Hayley: My girls. 

I am so proud of how far both of 
you have come this year. Thank 
you for sticking it out, rising bril-
liantly to the task and being the best 
damn news writers this paper has 
seen since that guy Reza graduated. 
You’re going to do a phenomenal 
job next year. I know we’re leaving 
the Guardian in capable hands. 

To Trevor: If I had to pick 12 
people to be in my ultimate party 
crew, you would be number six.

To Kelsey: I am jealous of your 
copy-editing skills.

To Cheryl and Arielle: Road-
trip posse for life. Please play good 
music at production next year.

To Vishal: My method is still 
superior. Put that in your pipe and 
smoke it. 

And to all of the rest of you who 
have shaped my experience at the 
Guardian: Thank you for being the 
zaniest, hardest-working, most over-
the-top crew of intellectual misfits 
I have ever known. Being around 
you has made me a more complete 
person.

JENNA BROGAN
HIATUS EDITOR

F ilm critics know that every good movie has a good ending. Don’t worry, I won’t spoon-feed you a 
load of a crap about happily-ever-afters, 
but I will say this: After four years of toil-
ing over quotations, semicolons and em 
dashes, I’m going out with a bang.

If you told me four years ago that one 
day I would be Hiatus editor, I would 
have laughed in your face. I never spoke 
up at newspaper meetings, my favorite 
film is “Little Miss Sunshine” and I may 
or may not have symptoms of Bieber 
fever. But before you judge me, I’ll bet 
even A.O. Scott taps his foot when-
ever Britney Spears comes on the radio. 
Honestly, when did pretension become 
such a redeeming quality? 

If always agreeing with the Academy’s 
picks for best films of the year makes you 
an authority in the arts-and-entertain-

ment realm, then revoke my title. 
Truth is: If the rhythm moves me, I’m 

going to dance. I don’t need some Rolling 
Stone writer to tell me what music I like. 
If Sandra Bullock’s Oscar win for “The 
Blind Side” is any indication, fame is little 
more than a popularity contest.

Every time I walk into an AMC, I 
find myself wondering: What happened 
to Hollywood? Sorry, but book adapta-
tions, remakes, substance-empty chick 
flicks, recycled Michael Bay-splosions 
and five “Bring It On” sequels do not 
count as innovation.

Is a well-developed storyline, visually 
stunning cinematography, witty script, 
multidimensional characters, actors 
who are right for the roles (not simply 
hired for their entertainment value) and 
an overall message that really makes us 
think too much to ask?

JAKE BLANC
SPORTS EDITOR�t�$0-6./*45

I should start learning karate now. Or maybe Jiu-Jitsu. Hell, even Tae Bo would 
be a step in the right direction. 
After four years of talking some 
serious smack, I’m graduating, 
and I have to stop hiding up in 
the ivory tower of my Guardian 
columns. This means that the 
many people I offended — most-
ly Dodgers and Yankees fans, but 
also fair amounts of pro-Israel, 
Obama-loving, Prius-driving 
middle-class elites — would love 
a chance to share their “opin-
ions” with me in person. 

I’m not too worried about 
taking on the folks angered by 
my progressive politics, but I do 
not want to meet a pissed-off 
New Yorker in a dark alley. 

In any case, the time has 
finally come to leave the 
Guardian, UCSD and Southern 
California behind. As much 

as I am overjoyed to be done 
with college and start some new 
adventures, I’m actually pretty 
sad to say goodbye to the people 
and experiences that made my 
time here so great, and a lot of 
that credit needs to go to the best 
damn newspaper in the country.

I got my start with the 
Guardian as a sports writer when 
two high school friends and 
former sports editors — Rael 
Enteen and Danai Leininger —

Those first articles covering the

poll got me going, and for four 
years, I wrote as much as I could

I would like to raise a toast: To the Guardian and its staff. Without you both, my final 
year on this campus would not have 
been as kick-ass as it was. As I sit in 
this muggy office at 2 a.m. — long 

past first, second and third edits — 
I couldn’t be happier.

years of college. One winter’s day in 
2009, they noticed my sloppy copy-
reader application, jerked me into the 
nearest swivel chair, handed me some 
new-hire paperwork and stamped a big, 
invisible “G” on my forehead. I was in.

I had no idea how to assimilate. It 
took a full weeks to realize that “copy” 
meant me. I’d miss a million AP mis-
takes. One of my first news grabs ended 
up in a blubbering phone call to then-
news editor Reza because my contact 
wasn’t calling me back. (Bitch.) 

That low-key anxiety attack sud-
denly made me a part of the Guardian 
in-crowd. After initiation, I came to 
understand the people behind the titles:

Simone, you are the most empower-
ing woman, keeping us in check but 
still embodying the edginess of Ke$ha 
24/7. Trevor, my favorite, how can you 
write poetry, place articles, eat sand-
wiches and play deejay on YouTube 
simultaneously? My section, I’m so 
proud of you guys for breaking out of 
copy’s stereotypical wallflower persona, 
what with Monica’s requests to chain up 

the dog and Masha’s passive-aggressive 
post-its telling everyone to lay off our 
computers’ balls. Original sports editor 
Jake and his successor, Vishal: You both 
have a Disney prince-like charm that 
always makes me mosey (extra slowly) 
past the sports office. Alyssa, you are 
truly superwoman, showing the world 
that we UCSD kids can work hard and 
party hard, no sweat. Edwin, you’re the 
master of dance, sloshball and sex jokes 
— how can I be cool like you? Hayley 
and Angela, I’m always amazed at your 
politeness, apologizing whenever you 
ask me to copy read something (aka do 
my job). Reza, you better believe I will 
be spicing up your Facebook once a 
week now that I can’t bombard you with 
cheer in person anymore — and last but 
never least, Cheryl, you could make a 
Guardian gossip zine with your endless 
knowledge. I know it’s creepy, but I want 
to keep you in my pocket forever.

In a nutshell, I’ve been in love with 
the Guardian for a year.  So much that 
I slept with bugs, peed in a bush, ate a 
barely cooked hot dog, listened to scary 
stories about Toys R Us and got bitched 
out by Sue the park ranger for blasting 
Julie Andrews last weekend — yet some-
how, I would do it all over in a second.

It’s your world, we’re just baking in it.

S taying in San Diego wasn’t the god-awful decision I imag-ined it’d be. In my defense, I’d 
already spent 18 years here before 
everyone else showed up. And during 
that time, I’d firmly decided I didn’t 
like the ocean, Shamu nor short-
sleeved shirts.

Don’t get me wrong — not every-
thing’s changed. I still don’t care for 
the ocean, or Shamu. But I’ve come 
to terms with San Diego; if only 
because the last four years have been 
worth all the salt water in the world. 

Like other exhausted interests, 
journalism was something I picked 
up on a half-whim. Film came before 
it. Matter of fact, film was the reason 
I started writing for the Guardian in 
the first place. It took three applica-
tions (ahem, Simone), but because of 
it, I spent the next three years of my 
life swallowing NoDoz three times a 
week. Needless to say, it was the best 
decision I ever made in college.

However, I’d be lying if I said that 
the Guardian was the only thing that 
made these last four years so amaz-
ing. I have others to thank too.

To Mom and Dad: Thank you for 
your continued love, support, Triton 
Cash and text messages that I know 
take five minutes to type. I love you 
so much. Adriana: I still read the let-
ter you typed on my (then-new) lap-
top from time to time — the one in 
electric green. And yes, I remember 
pretending to be beached mermaids 
lost at shore. Next year’s going to be 
amazing. Trust me.

To Rah: I know I’ve told you this 
before, but there’s no one I admire 
more. I can’t wait to visit the obe-
lisk again. To Carmina and Yedid: 
Thanks for letting me be your little 
brother, and for convincing me my 
Spanish wasn’t as terrible as it was. 

And now, for Guardian folks. To 
Ke$ — sorry, Simone: How someone 
could be so silly, sexy and damn good 

at turning out headlines amazes me. 
I’m honored to end my tenure with 
you at the helm. Alyssa and Reza: 
The managing office was by far my 
favorite, and not because of the beer 
closet in the corner. Sake’s on me this 
Friday, but only the first cup.

To News, the girls who stroked 
every ligament of my musical ego: 
Much love, and many nights filled 
with the best of the ’80s. Hiatus: My 
alma mater and the greatest section 
to write for — hands down. Thanks 
for putting up with my leftovers, and 
the eight weeks that they rotted there 
for. And Sports: May your lives be 
a never-ending series of Jamaican 
Horn moments.

Emily: Words can’t describe 
the magic you conjured up, every 
Sunday, to turn Focus into art. And 
to Aprille, Neda and Zoe: You were 
three of the most talented associates 
I had the fortune of working with. 
The pleasure was all mine.

back. You’re needed.
This year’s seniors are probably a little more 

aware of how much I love them. Alyssa: We’re the 
same person (only you, like, get shit done), and 
I can’t imagine life without you. It’s going to be 
weird. Reza: I forgive you for dropping me, and 
for going to DC. Most of all I’m just stoked you’re 
not going back. Kelsey: How does one become 
as nice as you? It boggles my mind. Emily: You 
surpassed me so long ago — I’m in awe. Vishal: 
You’re the life of this party. Thanks for transfer-
ring. Edwin: Am I cool enough to be your friend 
yet? Please? Shida: I adore watching you sleep, 
but I wish we were dancing instead. Sari: Here’s to 
our cardboard box in Santa Monica. Let’s never 
be apart again, OK? Wes: Oh wait — you’re not a 
senior. Love you anyway.

Lastly, I offer my apologies to all those whose 
dreams I may have deferred this year with a 
half-raised eyebrow and a stupid red pen. The 
best leaders foster talent by instilling confidence 
— I never quite got the hang of that. To the A.S. 
councilmembers, the co-ops and whoever else we 
might have offended by misspelling your name 
or misunderstanding your cause: We know you’re 
just students too. But everyone needs a watchdog 
to keep them on their toes. Truce?

amazing things happened to fit into one measly 
column, but shout-outs need to go first and fore-
most to the 2010 Guardian sloshball champions. 
We showed heart, determination, unbelievable 
beer-drinking skills and an unmatched intel-
lect to put those asshole Koalas in their place. 
Few things will ever feel so good as seeing Kris 
Gregorian go down like a sack of moldy potatoes. 

The people who made my Guardian tenure 
unforgettable — specifically, my time as sports 
editor — include the following sexy beasts: Emily 
for being the greatest (and most patient) design 
editor on the planet; Janani and Matt for mob-
bing it as my associate editors and for keeping me 
sane; and Erik for helping keep the sports office 
the chillest of them all by always cracking (bad) 
jokes and watching sports 24/7. 

Besides being great editors and leaders, 
Simone, Reza and Alyssa are all still some of 
the coolest people I met at UCSD, which made 
working for them so much better. And Vishal, I 
can never thank you enough for letting me pass 
the torch to you; the section has never looked 
better. 

So after four years of “Blanc on Base,” I guess 
it’s time for me to round third and head home. 

P.S. Fuck the Dodgers, GO GIANTS. 

associate sports editor. This year, I wanted to 
play a larger part with the paper. I expected 
that Sundays and Wednesdays would turn into 
long days and more responsibility. What I didn’t 
expect was that the relationships I’ve built would 
define my senior year. From hazy nights in Vegas 
to an epic sloshball win, it truly has been an, uh, 
somewhat memorable year. 

On the more professional side, we have debat-
ed extensively over the meaning of athleticism, 
and you continued to grind away sports lingo to 
increase the accessibility of articles to the general 
public. Out of these arguments, I hope that you 
have come to learn more about sports than you 
ever wished you had — I know that I, for one, 
have come to appreciate the literal meanings of 
words far more than I care.  

We sports snobs often times get caught up in 
stylistic meaning without concern for compre-
hension. I hope future Guardian staffers and edi-
tors can build the same (sometimes adversarial) 
collegiality that we developed over the year.  

My only regret with the Guardian is not 
joining sooner. I’ll take solace in knowing that I 
made the most of this year. To the drinks we’ve 
shared and the good times we’ve had, this toast is 
over. Let’s chug some beer.

At the theater, no matter how open-minded 
I try to be, I always end up rolling my eyes at an 
awkward Michael Cera, Kristen Stewart twirling 
her greasy strands or the Coen brothers basking 
in their own cleverness. 

After four years of reviewing film — 95 per-
cent of which was uninspired — you’d think I’d 
have lost all faith in the industry. But amid the 
underproduced fodder that gets churned out at 
the box office each week, there’s always a glim-
mer of hope. Though few and far between, great 
films do get produced, and I — along with all 
other tortured buff — will hold on with every last 
ounce of faith until the next one arrives. 

On that silver lining, I’ll end with shout-outs. 
Simone: Thanks for taking a chance on a 

nobody whose application was a shoddy “Lion 
King” theater review. It may have taken a year 
of rewrites before I wrote anything worth pub-
lishing, but my debut 50-word blurb on “The 
Holiday” still hangs from my refrigerator. 

Dad and Mom: I don’t hate every film in 
the universe; I just have high standards. Yes — 
“Snakes on a Plane” really is one of the worst 
movies of all time. It didn’t really take me 20 min-
utes to go get popcorn.

Oh, and Nicolas Cage: Get a day job.

16�THE UCSD GUARDIAN� THURSDAY, JUNE 3, 2010� HIATUS

T hough her debut album was only a few years ago, Miley Cyrus is preparing for a precari-ous leap across the teen-adult divide. With 
the June 18 release of Can’t Be Tamed, Cyrus 
ditches her all-American digs for a she-woman 
roar. The titular track features the diva’s signature 
Tennessee croon, set to a heavy techno-dance 
synth borrowed from last year’s “Party in the 
U.S.A.” The new track, however, noticeably 
abandons the latter’s bubblegum sound for more 
mature club tracks — a sonic shift that one can 
assume continues throughout the album. Phasing 
out the sickly-sweet singles that dominated her 

previous album, Can’t Be Tamed trades in lyr-
ics about butterfly-inducing first dates for lyrics 
about abusive relationships.

The change is expected for the teen, who has 
gradually followed the familiar “I’m a grownup 
now!” path that Britney and Christina slithered 
down years before. While the darker, sexual lyr-
ics about how all the guys want her are sure to set 
fans of Cyrus’ good-girl image on edge, perhaps 
it’s for the better — Considering her almost 
robotic penchant for foot-in-mouth syndrome 
(she managed to shit about Thom Yorke, Jay-Z 
and her own single), Cyrus hasn’t always had her 
Disney persona on lock.

If a Poison cover and a scantily clad music 
video isn’t enough to convince you that the for-
mer Hannah Montana star is ready for the grind, 
then her new badass black duds will — 1992 
birth date be damned.

THE TWILIGHT SAGA: ECLIPSE

A s a respite from the summer heat and slews of action films, director David Slade’s “The Twilight Saga: Eclipse” will take you back to the somber forest of Forks, Washington for the third install-ment of the box office smash series. Picking up after 2009’s cliffhanger — where Edward pro-
posed to Bella and the vampires and werewolves forged an unholy alliance  — “Eclipse” is the stuff 
that shrieking fangirls and million-dollar movies are made of. 

With the same cast of perfectly-sculpted, vapid characters, fans shouldn’t expect a huge improve-
ment. All the bland “Twilight” staples are sure to cameo: Kristen Stewart will moodily tousle her hair, 
Taylor Lautner’s whine is sure to recall his prepubescent “Cheaper by the Dozen 2” performance and 
Robert Pattinson will groan this way through all 90 minutes with a hazy, angst-fueled deadpan. But 
why bother with warnings? Crippling shame or no, you’re still going to be dropping $10.50 at the 
midnight premiere decked out in fangs and a Team Edward tank that’s as sparkly as he is.

J ack Johnson’s fifth stu-dio album, To The Sea, is just as uninspired 
as its title suggests. While 
the 13 songs don’t stray 
far from Johnson’s typical 
style — laid-back jams ripe 
with acoustic strumming, 
lightweight drums and care-
free beach-day vocals — the 
tracks blur together until the 
album’s reduced to a never-
ending bonfire sing-along.

Working out of his 
solar-powered studios in 

Hawaii and Los Angeles, 
Johnson has nailed the chill, 
environmentally-friendly, 
beach-bro image to perfec-
tion — but it’s hard to take 
the perpetually stoned surf-
er facade seriously when the 
guy’s released four albums 
and fathered two children.

The lyrics continue in 
the same vein. Instead of 
providing genuine, mean-
ing we’re lost in a swarm 
of confusing metaphors. 
“Red Wine, Mistakes, 
Mythology” sounds like the 
product of one too many 
glasses of Merlot, as it finds 
Johnson stringing together 
muddled phrases like “little 
crying robots.”

Johnson attempts to 
supplement his usual sim-
plistic acoustic guitar sound 
by sporadically adding 
flowing keyboard, reverb-
heavy electric guitar and a 
healthy dose of tambourine 
throughout the album. 

But this attempt at variety 
only steers Johnson fur-
ther off course — the intro 
on the title track sounds 
like a Shins ripoff, while 
“No Good With Faces” is 
a drugged-out Brandon 
Flowers impersonation.

The album does have 
its moments, particularly 
with “When I Look Up,” a 
minute-long collection of 
running water noises, xylo-
phone plunking and a cho-
rus of background singers. 
Too bad the album’s best 
song is its shortest.

Johnson’s fifth attempt 
isn’t all bad. In fact, it’s 
pleasant in all the same 
way smoking a bowl is. But 
as charming as that might 
be, To The Sea still feels as 
though we are trapped on 
a boat in the middle of the 
ocean — water everywhere 
gets a little redundant.

A fter the success of his “Mission: Impossible” action 
thrillers, it seems as if 
Tom Cruise is finally tak-
ing a turn at self-parody. 
His new film, “Knight 
and Day,” has him 
indulging in slapstick 
shootouts and absurd 
one-liners, with the likes 
of, “No one follows us, 
or I kill myself and then 
her.” Cameron Diaz 
comes through with the 

sex appeal, playing the

KING OF THE BEACH BUMS CHURNS OUT MORE OF THE SAME

JUNE 30 JUNE 18



HIATUS� THURSDAY, JUNE 3, 2010� THE UCSD GUARDIAN�17

I f your Spring Quarter grades have got you down this summer, 
“Meet the Parents” director 
Jay Roach has got just the 
schadenfreuden remedy for 
your intellectual insecurities: Dinner 
for Schmucks, a movie about laugh-
ing at dumb people. Tim (played by 
“Knocked Up” alumnus Paul Rudd) is 
an ambitious suit looking to climb the 
corporate ladder. Just when he thinks 
he’s at the verge of a promotion, he’s 
given one more obstacle: He must find 
an idiot and bring him to his boss’ 
Dinner for Extraordinary People — an 
event where asshole businessmen show 
off their pedigree idiots for a grand 
prize promotion.

As it just so happens, Tim meets 
Barry (Steve Carell), a wide-eyed dim-

wit with a thing for dressing up dead 
mice. Much to the dismay of his empa-
thetic girlfriend, Tim invites Barry 
to the dinner. Though it seems for a 
moment that the duo’s unlikely friend-
ship might hinder Tim from bringing 
Barry to the freak show, the two go 
anyway. It’s a simple story, and, if little 
else, it’s sure to be packed with Carell’s 
signature shtick — scene after scene 
of cringe-worthy discomfort. Once 
“Schmucks” hits theatres July 13, one 
thing’s sure: No other slacker summer 
activity will make you feel smarter.

G et him to the Greek” is the spin-off of “Forgetting Sarah Marshall” we’ve been clamouring for since 
Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) first got 
into that bitchy blonde’spants in 2008. 
Now in his very own feature-length fol-
low-up, “Greek,” Snow has fallen off the 
sobriety wagon entirely — prompting 
the rock legend to partake in a string of 
motel-trashing ragers, absinthe binges 
and celebrity debauchery.

The grandeur doesn’t last long. 
Following the release of a racist ditty, 
Snow is quickly crushed under the pile 
of tabloid outrage that descends upon 
him. His career seems to have finally 
reached its breaking point. Fortunately 
for Snow, optimistic record label intern 
Aaron Green (Jonah Hill) — the drool-
ing fan boy in “Sarah Marshall” — sug-
gests to his hard-ass boss Sergio (Sean 
“P. Diddy” Combs) that Snow stage his 

comeback at the Greek Theater in Los 
Angeles. “Greek” follows the resulting 
mayhem as a frantic Green tries to get 
Snow from London to L.A. in time for 
the big show.

There’s no doubt that the cast is 
bizarre — but the mix works surpris-
ingly well for the film.

The film mocks Brand’s very public 
past of sex and drug addiction, utiliz-
ing his character’s outrageous persona 
to satirize a society fixated on fame and 
mocks his. He delivers side-splitters 
with ease, and his performance is a 
delusional and drug-addled one, stum-
bling through the streets of Las Vegas 
in search of a fix — it’s a sequence so 
organic it seems that he’s done it before. 

Not to be outdone, Diddy surprises 
us in his first comedic role as an intim-
idating boss. He wrenches laughter 
from an unsuspecting audience with 

one-liner gems like “I’m mind-fucking 
the shit out of you right now” capping 
off the film’s brilliant comedic tim-
ing. By contrast, Hill — a comparative 
expert in the role of the funnyman 
— disappoints as Diddy’s lapdog.  
The “Superbad” veteran is sidelined 
in “Greek” as a naïve newcomer who 
attempts to capture audience sympa-
thies, but fails to please with his overea-
ger demeanor. 

Nonetheless, “Greek” possesses a 
coveted ability to transport the audi-
ence into the helter-skelter mayhem of 
celebrity life, all while inducing laugh-
ter. The well-crafted comedic backbone 
of this summer flick is sure to make 
“Greek” the 2010 equivalent of  “The 
Hangover”— brimming with swearing, 
confusion and a fuckload of alcohol.

O n the heels of last year’s Relapse is this year’s Recovery: Eminem’s new concept album and sonic 180. He’s continuing on the path to maturity and sobriety, and, given that he spent a good part of 2005 through 
2008 binging on pills and booze, this release proves he’s already undergone 
a vast improvement. If first single “Not Afraid” is any indication, the album’s 
sure to feature triumphant, orchestral arrangements, backed by pulsating 
beats, heavy bass and Shady’s vicious wit. Unlike previous albums, Recovery 
is the rapper’s first album without a single appearance from Dre. Instead, 
Eminem’s latest will feature pop princesses like Pink and Rihanna — cer-
tainly a departure from what we know of the often misogynistic Mathers 
(after all, it was only 10 years ago when he was taking shots at Christina 
Aguilera on “The Real Slim Shady”). Since then Eminem’s been on quite the 
rollercoaster, alternating between musical genius and personal crash-and 
burns — perhaps now he has finally beaten his demons.

18�THE UCSD GUARDIAN� THURSDAY, JUNE 3, 2010� SENIOR SENDOFF

I consider myself to be an adaptable, “go-with-the-flow” kind of person. I’ve experienced enough change in my life to know that it’s a 
fact of life that ought to be embraced, not resisted.

Now, perched on the precipice of graduation, 
if only I could just conjure that wisdom, because 
right now, I feel a little empty.

I can’t fight a creeping vulnerability as I face 
up to the unnerving realization I have been trying 
to ignore for quite sometime now: college is over.

Truth is, if someone asked me at the school 
year’s start if I was ready to graduate, my answer 
would have been “hell yes.” I had never forged 
the “home away from home, best years of my life” 
collegiate experience that so many rave about.

My first two years at UC Riverside, I felt 
oppressed by the lack of commonalities between 
(at least what I thought was) a shallow-minded, 
intellectually uninspired student body and myself. 
I had a handful of good friends and few college- 
defining experiences I appreciated. I felt a sense 
of loss that I had missed out on “the good times.”.

When I transferred to UCSD, the cynicism 
that my time at Rivershit had cultivated per-
severed, and fit in seamlessly with the hordes 
of zombie students. But my senior year was an 
awakening of sorts, and it’s no coincidence my 
collegiate life finally became fulfilling when I 
joined the Guardian staff. You guys have enriched 
my life.

To the Guardian staff, word count constraints 
prevent me from writing to each of you individu-

ally, because if I did, you all would have page-
long essays. But if I have worked with you in the 
office on a regular basis, then know this: The 
time we have spent together this year has made 
this past year the best of my life to date (sorry, 
can’t help it). You bunch of quirky, funny, unique, 
endearing group of intelligent people are the kind 
I always thought college was supposed to intro-

duce to me. The memories of our times together 
will be ingrained on my heart as long as it beats, 
as they’ve transformed my experience in college 
from one of indifference to one I don’t want to 
see end. Thank you for touching my life, and I’m 
humbled to have had this opportunity.

I had way more in this, but it wouldn’t be 
authentic if I didn’t have to edit my work down.

P hotography has always been a conun-drum for me: I believe it is more important to live the moment than to 
necessarily capture the moment; I would far 
rather be in front of a lens than behind one; 
I do not like the constant pressure of getting 
the perfect shot, but the perfect shot is what 
I always want; and although I live with the 
camera, you will not likely see me with my 
camera, unless I am on an assignment. Yet 
despite everything, I love capturing the 
emotion and human spirit of every event or 
place I have been.

I want to thank the Guardian for the 
honor and privilege of serving the students 
and faculty at UCSD for the past four years. 
The work has been personally rewarding, 
and I can deny the occasional pleasure in the 
recognition of fellow students for the work 
I so love.

A big “thank you” is extended to every 
editor who has ever worked in the sports 
section (Danai, Rael, Janani, Jake, Matt, 
Vishal and Liam). You’ve all made our time 
together at the Guardian hilariously enter-
taining and enjoyable. Emily, thank you 
for working with my pictures when I could 
not capture your intent; your designs were 
always awesome! To John: You are the man, 
good luck next year. I am certain you’ll make 
the paper look good. 

To everyone else, it’s been a pleasure 
working with you; I love you all. So this is 
Erik closing the lens cover one last time for 
the Guardian. Have an awesome, grand, fan-
tastic, great, stellar … grand day!

Oh yeah, and “Lionhearts” are the best 
thing to happen to photography since … 
ever. And in regard to photography, I am 
certain the Guardian sets the standard for 
other California college newspapers.

We have set a high bar of accomplish-
ment that I am sure future staff will carry 
forward.

A dmittedly, my stint at the Guardian was sort of impersonal, as I spent less 
time forming relationships and 
more time making my comics and 
illustrations look as badass as pos-
sible. That’s not to say that I don’t 
have my fair share of apprecia-
tion for the Guardian. It gave me 
a sense of purpose and direction 
when I lacked it most, and despite 
my emotional detachment from 
the paper, I’m forever grateful 
for the Guardian’s effect on my 
life and the relationships that I’ve 
formed there.

I’d like to thank Chris 
Kokiousis for giving me 
my start. Without his 
encouragement, his 
love of video games 
and his creation of 
my column, I would 
never have seen the 
Guardian as a legit cre-
ative venue. Thanks, Christina 
Aushana, for hiring me as an illus-
trator and giving me a chance to 
unload my emotional woes on our 
undergraduate population. Had she 
not suggested that I draw a comic, 

Sunny-Side Up would never have 
been birthed. Consequently, I’d like 
to thank Simone and anyone else 
involved in my hiring as Art Editor 
for giving me the liberty to extend 
my mopey story throughout the rest 

the year. Without that option, 
I don’t think I would have 

ever written my own 
comic novel.

I’d like to thank 
Reza for his vision 
and preference for 
my particular artis-

tic style. Had he not 
continually approached 

me with new ideas, I would 
never have swung by the office as 
much as I did. I’d also like to thank 
him for our collaborative efforts, 
which I find to have been one of 
the most fulfilling opportunities the 

Guardian has allowed me (next to 
Sunny-Side Up). But mostly, he’s 
someone I could talk to when I was 
emo-ing out. Thanks, man.

I’d like to thank Emily for her 
peppy personality, juxtaposed 
against a usually irritated demeanor. 
I always found this to be a splen-
did surprise. I’d like to thank Erik 
for his sense of humor — which, 
against Emily’s personality, was the 
best comic relief in the office. I’d 
also like to thank Vishal Natarajan, 
whose heart-to-hearts in and out of 
the office always kept me grounded 
in the here and now.  Incidentally, 
I’d also like to thank his drunken 
alter-ego for embodying all the ’70s 
Jack Nicholson sleaze that I didn’t 
know actually existed.

I’d like to thank News, Opinion, 
Focus and Hiatus for dealing with 

my tardiness. Having never been 
the most punctual artist, I appreci-
ate that they dealt with me ’til the 
very end. The same to the manag-
ing editors. I’d also like to thank the 
art team for taking me seriously.  I 
never thought myself the most com-
petent individual, and their etiquette 
toward my rank was humbling. 

Finally, I’d like to thank the 
Guardian for setting me up with 
Kim Cyprian, the new art editor 
and fellow artist extraordinaire, 
whose existence has created an 
altogether new fear of life and death 
that I never once fathomed in my 
overabundant imagination.  Never 
has life seemed so vast and adven-
turous until now. Thanks.

Never having been very good 
at goodbyes, I’ll just say: Thanks, 
Guardian. I’ll see you around.

DESIGN EDITOR
EMILY KU

I n true Guardian fashion, I’m writ-ing this following a 5 a.m. produc-tion — after which I headed home 
not to sleep, but to prepare for a discussion 
I had to teach at 8 a.m. I’ve got InDesign 
open because I still have to design Sports, 
Photoshop open because I’m trying to plan 
the image that’s supposed to go with it, 
and the last five text messages I’ve received 
(and the last seven I’ve sent) have been 
Guardian-related.

How do you just walk away from some-
thing so all-encompassing? How do you 
reconcile what has been your entire life with 
the mystery that is to come?

The other day, Neda and Liam were 
arguing over whose section I was more loyal 
to, Focus or Sports. (I wasn’t sure if it was 
the right time to point out that the debate 
was moot, because neither of them will be 
getting me next year.) Richard only gave 
Focus to me because no one else wanted it, 
but Alyssa had my back from the beginning, 
taking unfortunate creative liberties with 
Michael Capparelli’s artwork. I wouldn’t 
have wanted anyone else with me every step 

of the way. Dave humored me when I had 
my epiphany last winter (or psychotic break, 
however you want to look at it), until he 
realized I was dead serious — and so “The 
Memory Remains” went to print. 

Edwin kept right in step with me this 
entire year, always dependable, always 
positive, and never saying a word when he 
was stuck in the office at 3 a.m. because I’d 
thrown out three different designs. Once 
the dust from Focus reconstruction settled, 
Sports was next. Janani, the only person I 
would ever share an office and “Lost” with, 
and Jake, Vishal, Matt and Liam: It’s your 
enthusiasm and pride that inspires my love 
for designing your section. No section is 
more fun to work with. Can we say the rest 
is Guardian history?

I sometimes think about how terrible 
my timing is, becoming so attached to print 
media when it’s on its way out. But I’m only 
lucky to have found this part of my stressball 
self when I did, uncovered by a hodgepodge 
of scrappy journalists you can’t find any-
where else.

With design, it was Simone who was my 

best critic, and Reza my best friend. Simone, 
you can weather any storm. Design never 
fails because of you; I don’t know how you 
do it all. Reza, I can’t think of the word “col-
lab” without thinking of you, and no one 
can seem to call me Em Dash quite the same 
way. I’ll be looking for that telltale resilient 
bird when you become famous.

Angela and Hayley, all I know is that 
you guys are going to do the Guardian 
proud. Melody, I have the utmost faith in 
you. Remember that you are only at your 
beginning, looking back on my ending. Just 
a heads-up: you’re going to be everyone’s 
favorite person. I couldn’t have asked for a 
more promising successor.

And Erik: No words can really say. As 
Dave said, the war is almost over. But I 
wouldn’t have traded the ride for anything.

A designer’s work is always seen but 
never known. It’s always a journey, but it’s 
always worth it. To everyone, thank you. I 
don’t know how else to say it. I would end 
with an em dash — but I wouldn’t be able to 
qualify it with anything more amazing than 
the people who make that me.

AS A SPORT THAT IS NOT
sanctioned in high school athletics, the javelin 
is usually dominated by upperclassmen. Howe 

shattered this mold a year ago when he burst on 
the scene as a freshman to win the CCAA title 
and earn CCAA Freshman of the Year honors. 
But it was during his sophomore season that 

Howe developed into a top athlete, progressing 
at a rate that exceeded everyone’s expectations 
— in less than one year, he furthered his best 
throw by close to 25 feet. On May 29, Howe 

took home a national title, throwing 225 feet at 
the championship meet in Charlotte, N.C., to 

become UCSD’s first male track and field cham-
pion at the Division-II level.

WHATEVER THE SECRET TO
hitting may be, Gregorich certainly found it this year. 
With new school records in hits, doubles and RBIs in 
a season, the senior first baseman undoubtedly had 
one of the best seasons in UCSD baseball history all 

while hitting a ridiculously high .455 average. His 
awards are too numerous to list in full: CCAA Player 

of the Year, Daktronics West Region Player of the Year 
and ABCA/Rawlings All-American are only some of 
the highlights of his trophy case. Gregorich’s success 

at the plate helped drive the Tritons all the way to the 
Division-II championship game, where they narrowly 

lost to Southern Indiana University. Nonetheless, 
Gregorich’s performance this season will go down in 
the Tritons’ history books as one of the best UCSD 

has ever seen.

Rossman got the starting nod and did not disappoint. 
Rossman kept a no-hitter through the eighth inning, 

but allowed two straight doubles that let Mules tie 
the game 1-1. The game moved on to extra innings, 
but the Triton bullpen stayed empty, and Rossman 
settled down to continue his pitching dominance. 

Rossman did not allow a single hit for the rest of the 
game, which finally ended thanks to an RBI single 
from Kellen Lee. The senior righty finished the day 

with an 11-inning complete game, allowing only two 
hits and striking out 12 batters. A complete game is 
hard enough, but for a pitcher to pitch 11 dominant 

innings is unheard of. In his last start as a Triton, 
Rossman’s outing against Central Missouri set the 

standard for playoff performances.

UCSD BASEBALL MAY HAVE COME JUST SHORT OF A
national title, but its season was far from a disappointment. In fact, it was the most 
successful run to date, and it’s hard to argue that this team was anything but one of 

the nation’s best: 54 wins, only eight losses and just two runs short of a national title. 
The Tritons never dropped below fourth in the national rankings and were the top-
ranked team for the final month of the season. UCSD also raked in the individual 
accolades, with a phenomenal six players named to the All-American team. Senior 
Vance Albitz won third Gold Glove and repeated as National Defensive Player of 

the Year, and senior Brandon Gregorich took CCAA Player of the Year honors. The 
list goes on, but the message is clear: Baseball was UCSD’s best team this year.

women’s high-jumper in Division-II, Rainwater strug-

only able to clear 5’5.25” — almost five inches below 
her personal best — and had to go to a jump-off to 
break a tie with her nearest competitor. Rainwater had 
been unable to shake a nagging back injury for several 
weeks, and by the end of the competition was in so 
much pain that she needed to be helped off the mat

after each jump. It wasn’t discovered until later that Rainwater was actually competing 
with a fractured back. “If we knew at the time we would have pulled her,” head coach Tony 

Salerno said. “She said she had some pain but that she could still jump.” Rainwater man-
aged to clear 5’7.25”, allowing her to take her second straight conference title. Rainwater’s 

tough performance demonstrates a tenacity that few athletes can claim to have.

IN THE SECOND ROUND OF THE NCAA DIVISION-II TOURNAMENT
on Nov. 14, UCSD hosted Chico State in a battle of conference foes. The Tritons were 
making their seventh appearance in the second round, while it was the Wildcats first 
— yet Chico had beaten UCSD 2-0 when the two first met on 2009 on Sep. 20.  The 

Wildcats came out strong and struck first in the 23rd minute, but the Tritons didn’t wait 
long to equalize. Less than 60 seconds later, sophomore striker Sarah McTigue hit a blis-
tering shot from the top of the box into the top-left corner of the goal, and the game was 
tied at 1-1. The deadlock was finally broken in the 86th minute, when McTigue gathered 

a loose ball on the edge of the box and fired in a hard shot. The ball slipped past the 
goalkeeper, and the Tritons survived a frantic last few minutes for the 2-1 win. The dra-
matic goal provided for UCSD’s most entertaining game this year and sent the Tritons 

into the third round of the tournament.
