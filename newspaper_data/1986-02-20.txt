-Every chemical reaction in the 
body is speeded up by an 
enzyme," Knowles said recently. 
"If we can understand how these 
dramatic accelerations occur, 
then we wiU understand at a 
molecular level how our bodies 
work - because enzymes are

Student activists' 
orientation 
By LAUREN FRESH. Staff Wllcer 

T HE CENTER FOR Third World Organi ZIng (CTWO) and the Na ti onal 
Student Campaign Against 
Hunger (NSCAH) have both 
begun programs to encourage 
direct student involvement In 
timely political issues. 

C1WO will host a Summer 
Institute program designed to 
educate student activists in 
leadership and organizing skins, 
accordi ng to a press release . 
NSCAH will begin a program 
called the Action for Community 
Transformauon (ACT) 'which will 
give financial and programmatiC 
assIstance to student projects 
which are designed to combat 
hunger. 

This summer 30 minority 
students will participate in 
organizing campaigns on toxic 
waste , tenants' rights, welfare 
rights and farmworker rights 
around the country through the 
Oakland·based Summer Institute. 
According to Francis Calpotura , 
program coordinator of the 
Summer Institute , "This is a very 
unique opportunity for student 
activists to get together with 
peers from all across the country 
and share experiences while 
developing skills which will 
directly benefit their campus 
organizing and community 
work." 

The NSCAH has launched a 
program designed to combat 
hunger in America. Funded by a 
$100,000 gram fro m USA for 
Africa the program is designed to 
encourage student activity 
around this Issue. According to 
Hope RicciOtti , field oordinator 
for the National Student 
Campaign , the ACT program will 
sponsor surplus food distrib ution

C Ol l EGES across CalIfornIa and Arizona met last Saturd ay at 
UCSD for the Southern ReglOnal 
Co nvention of the Model United 
Nations. ThIS prelImmary 
regIOnal meeung of delegates WIll 
be followed by a much larger 
convention , the Far West 
conference (MUNFW), held 
annuaUy during the second week 
in April. 

The MUNFW simulates 
committee of the United Nations 
(UN). Final reports are sent for 
considera tion to the Secretariat 
of the UN in New York. 
MUNFW delegates will 
participate in a General Assembly 
and in Other committees. 

"A delegate learns not only the 
problems of one nation , but also 
the procedures of the UN in 
dealing with these problems and 
poliCies. The MUNfW can be an 
intensely personal experience in 
which individual psychology, 
strategy and group interaction 
play highly sophisticated roles," 
according to the SecretaTlat of 
the MUNfW. 

UCSD will be the host school 
for the 37th session of the 

MUNFW, and will serve as the 
Secretanat, provI~Ing informatIon 
and organization for the other 
sc hools and admInistering the 
annual four·day conference. ~

Beverly Varga, Dean of

Of mice, and men, and lynching 
When John Steinbeck wrote Of Mice and Men, and of people in 

dubious battle, he was beseeching a promising society not to fall into 
naive but cruel patterns of rules and regulations. Where downtrodden 
migrant fannworkers carelessly dreamt of privacy and solitude and the 
chance to break away from the peonage of the fields, tight-fisted 
ranchers plotted along with the state to stifle any reform movement. 
The local police and , at times, the national guard were brought in to 
put down stirkes; California gradually turned into a battleg.round over 
basic human rights. The fruitpickers made infamous by Steinbeck's 
pen made very little leeway into the land of their dreams, and the 
nightmare of well-financed repression continued to invade the hopes 
of the migrant camps. 

Lynching was, and still is in pans of these states, a recourse that is 
taken by a few grotesque individuals. Its origins in the 19th century 
pertain directly to the intimidation of blacks by racist groups such as 
the Ku Klux Klan, who felt the law was better served in their hands. 
Advertisements often appeared in the town's newspapers inviting 
proper folk to attend the lynching of an arbitrarily chosen and 
innocent black. The law in the town, embodied in the personage of 
the sheriff, not only condoned the actions of the mob, but often 
participated as a leader. 

The -modern interpretation of lynching carries these connotations 
of the illegal taking of the law into ~ne.'s hands for the purpose of 
passing judgment on a suspected cnmmal. However, as popular 
culture portrays such acts, it is inevitably the police who save the 
innocent victim from the clutches of the mob, not the reverse. 

Here at UCSD the traditions of scheming and collaboration with 
those who wish to keep order for the status quo are being kept intact. 
The charges that are being brought against Coalition for a Free South 
Africa member Russell Andalcio exemplify this point. For what is 
happening to Russell cannot be called an isolated incident of mental 
negligence on the part of the police. It is a strategic move on the part 
of the administration to shift public awareness away from the issue of 
UC divestment to the actions of one individual. Instead of addressing 
the prevalent question at hand (which is UCs compliance in 
upholding a system of apartheid that has just this Tuesday murdered 
19 blacks in Johannesburg), the UCSD administration would rather 
have you thinking about the ambiguous allegation of lynching. Just 
dwell on the historical irony of the charge or on the historical 
meaning and popular usage of the tenn "lynching." 

Here at UCSD, the police department, with the sanction of the 
student conduct coordinator, is attempting to redefine the popular 
concept of lynching. They accuse a man, best known for his actions 
against inequality protected by law, of preventing two police officers 
from arresting a student reacting to a provocateur. The act of lynching 
in order to proclaim a suspect's innocence is not the act of a mob, 
but that of a unified people. Russell is innocent because he did not 
direct the crowd to act as it did. He didn't have to; the crowd was 
sensitive to the injustice of the police actions. 

And as Steinbeck believed, those who sow injustice reap from the 
people the grapes of wrath. 

The echoes of institutionalized racism 
By ROSA MARTINEZ 

The history of institutionalized 
racism stili echoes loudly in this 
country. And JUSt when it 
seemed we had made some 
dents In compensating for some 
of the bigotry which has long 
been a pan of our American 
experience, the government 
anempted to weaken the Voting 
Rights Act and almost every 
other piece of civil nghts 
legislation forbidding 
discrimination. More recently, 
the justice Department 
auempned to retrench the 
Executive Order on Affirmative 
Action which sought through 
goals and timetables to increase 
the number of women and 
minorities employed by federal 
contractors. 

Critics of affirmative action 
argue that theSe benefits are 
extended to those who have not 
actually suffered discrimination. 
But even when we know of past 
victims, we readily find reasons 
for overlooking their situation. 
Thomas Nelson Flanagan 
suffered and felt the 
reverberations of this sulIen ng 
throughout his life. 

After enlisting in the Navy in 
1942, the then-19-year-old 
Flanagan had an experience 
common to many blacks in 
military service at that time. The 
military, especially the Navy, 
reflected the worst social 
conditions; the effects of 
segregation were rampant. The 
Hampton Institute Conference 
on the Negro in National 
Defense declared the mlhtary 
"the most undemocratic and un-
American aspect of our 
government." Indeed , the War 
Depanm<!nt's wntten policy 
before and after World War II 
SImply proclaImed that the 
mihtary was "a product of 
American society." Its role was 
not to change SOCial conditions. 
but to see that black service men 
received no more than they had 
received in clvihan life. This 
translated into separate regimens, 
all-black squadrons and 
segregated training units . In ' the 

avy, the polIcy excluded blacks 

from all branches of the service 
except the mess men's branch. 
There were no black 
commissioned olIicers and no 
advanced training programs 
open to blacks. On mihtary bases 
where blacks were accepted, the 
facIli ties were segreg3ted and 
heavily patrolled. 

Drumg World War I, Thomas 
Flanagan was stationed in me 
town of Vallejo, California. One 
Sunday afternoon in Drcember 
of 194 2, he witnessed white 
saIlors and marines enter a town 
and , without provocation , begin 
shooting into a crowd of 
unarmed black sailors and 
soldiers. Several of the balck men 
were injured . 

Flanagan. who protested the 
shooting to his superior o lIicer, 
two weeks later found himself a 
victim of racial injustice as well. 
For reporting the inCident, he 
was given a choice of either 
being charged with mutiny, a 
capital olIense, or accepting a 
dishonorable discharge. Fearing 
for his life, he chose to leave. He 
was immediately presented with 
civilian clothes and sent under 
guard to the train station. 

In 1979, with the help of the 
Red Cross , which was then 
assisting veterans in upgrading 
their discharges, Flanagan had 
the Naval Discharge Board 
review the Navy's earlier 
proceedlllgs against him. 
Charges of promoting raCial 
trouble were removed from his 
record and the board finally 
concluded that there had been 
prejudice in the discharge. 

Aanagan turned to the courts 
to collect back-pay allowance 
and compensatory damages. His 
case finally reached the U.S. 
Coun of Appeals in Washington , 
D.C. in 1983. Sadly, the coun 
upheld a lower Court of Claims 
deciSion that the statute of 
hmiauons had expired for 
Flanagan 34 years ago. 

Flanagan and others like him 
had no recourse under our 
Judlctal system when their claims 
were fresh . We were, as a nation, 

still shackled by the bonds of 
prejudice. Over two decades 
passed before the Civil Rights 
Movement began its march 
towards equality. 

We still have a long way to go 

in this struggle. The effects of 
discrimination have not been 
erased by time . We cannot reject 
Thomas Flanagan's claims . 
Although Thomas Flanagan is 
one of many victims of past 

dicrimination, his cause, at least, 
is a place to begin.

Editor: 
An Open Letter to the UCSD 
Community. On February n , 
Russell Andalcio, a student at 
UCSD and a prominent member 
of the Coalition for a Free South 
Africa was charged by the UCSD 
administration with the following 
false, but serious, crimes: 

California Penal Code: Section 
405(a) - Lynching: Prompting 
others to assault university police 
olIicers. UCSD Student Conduct 
Code: Violations of Sections 
VA7, VA9, and VA 10 arising 
out of the above penal charge. 

These charges were leveled 
three weeks after January 23 , the 
day Bishop Desmond Tutu spoke 
on campus, at which event these 
alleged crimes were supposedly 
committed. During this interim, 
the UC administration and 
police did not communicate with 
Russell Andalcio or other people 
who were present at the 
incident; commUnica tion , which 
would have enabled the 
administration to make a 
judgement that did not 
exclusivel, rely on a single 
version 0 the events. By relying 
on the police reports alone, the 
administration has already 
judged Russell Andalcio to be 
guilty, without seekmg out any 
conflicting testimonials of the 
event. In light of these 
occurences, we feel impelled to 
provide the UCSD community 
with a true account of the events 
of that day. It is an account that 
is supported by many 
testimonials , not only from 
members of the Coahtion for A 

Free South Africa, but from 
witnesses who have no affiliation 
with us. 

On January 23, Bishop Tutu 
came to UCSD to speak to and 
mobilize people against 
apanheid . From two hours 
before 'the event an extreme 
right-wing evangelist, Brother 
Jed , harangued Bishop Tutu's 
audience with praises of the 
racist and exploitative Botha 
regime in South Africa. The 
administration - represented 
Nick Aguilar - recognizing the 
provocative and racist nature of 
Brother jed's preaching, 
requested the coalition to ignore 
Brother jed's repugnant insults. It 
is significant that they did not 
counsel Brother jed to refrain 
from "disturbing the peace." 

The people, whose spirits had 
been lifted by Bishop Tutu's 
speech, came out of the gym to 
be confronted , once agian, by 
Brother Jed's racist rantings. 
Coalmon members and others 
held up' anti-a partheid banners 
in front of Brother jed and

chanted slogans in response to 
him. Students, frustrated and 
angered by Brother Jed's 
continued harrassmet, tried to 
reason with him, to discontinue 
preaching his birted message. It 
was obvious to a that the 
situation was becoming volatile. 
The police remained indilIerem 
now, as they had been before 
Bishop Tutu's talk, to what they 
had recognized as provocative to 
the students. They did not even 
try to separate Brother jed from 
the students. They refused to 
accept any responsiblity for 
allowing a bigoted provocateur to 
preach while they were 
supposedly proViding security for 
a leader in the anti-apanheid 
struggle in South Africa. A 
Student who was not a member 
of the coalition , incensed by 
Brother jed, struggled to pull 
down his ban ner. Police moved 
in and 'put a choke-hold on the 
s tudent. They did not touch 
Brother Jed and turned instead 
on the people. The people 
surrounded the police and 
demanded the release of the 
student. 

It was at mis point that Russell 
Andalcio came from the gym 
steps, where he had been until 
this time, and Jomed the 
students on th e hump. The 
pohce, under pressure, released 
the student and re treated to the 
gym steps. Russell Andalcio then 

I- made a short speech asking the 
stude nts to demand that they no 
longer be expected to suppon 
racist and faSCIst Ideologies on 
our campus. 

Plea~ lum to page 5 

lHTffiSluTffiSluTfRSlHTffiS 
Please tum to page 4 

The "lynch" charge is based 
on the police allegation that 
"when Andalcio stopped coming 
towards us he began yelling at 
people in the crowd to Get 
Them." All those who were 
present know that this is a 
baseless fabrication . The action 
against Brother Jed and the 
release of the student were 
conducted spontaneously by the 
people and were not mastermind-
ed by any member of the coalition. 

Russell Anda1cio has also been 
charged with disturbing the 
peace. We question whether a 
generally indifferent campus or 
racist preaching are the definiton 
of peace, or whether the $2.4 
billion invested in South Africa, 
which enslave and murder 
Africans in the name of profit , is 
a definition of peace. If so, we 
are proud to be guilty of 
disturbing this "peace." 

It is significant that newspaper 
accounts and even official 
administration reports of that 
day do not focus on, or even 

mention , Russell Andalcio's 
speech, his main contribution to 
that event. Despite this , the 
police have singled him out for 
reprisals. By harassing students, 
the police and administration are 
trying to cripple all progressive 
student movements on this 
campus. On our campus, the UC 
administration has a long history 
of taking reprisals against 
students organizing to fight 
injustice; the most recent 
example is that of Russell 
Andalcio . While for the last few 
months they have . ~on entrated 
their repression on e anti-
apanheid moveme t, they have 
alwa ys tried to create an 
apolitical and apathetiC campus. 
It is also alarming that the UC 
Regents have refused to divest 
from South Africa but are 
harrassing anti-apanheid 
student.s and have sin,g\ed out for 
repression a person who was 
speaking out against racism. By 
charging Russell Andalcio, the 
administration is placing 
banning orders on 'students of 
conscience,' similar to the South 
Africa policy against political

opponents and prisoners of 
conscience. It chooses to do this 
to those committed to fight 
investments in South Africa , 
rather than to individuals who 
propagate racist and fascist 
ideologies on this campus. The 
parallel wi th South Africa is 
alarming because there, tOO, a 
racist and facist state represses 
the opponents of the system. We 
commit ourselves to struggle 
politically against this repression 
of students' movements for 
justice. 

On a personal level, Russell 
Andalcio faces severe 
consequences: dismissal , 
suspension fines, loss of 
employment and eviction from 
university housing. Russell 
Andalcio is due to mduate in 
June but will be unable to while 
the consequences are personal 
harassment and interference with 
the progress of his scholarly 
work. 

There are deliberate 
misrepresentations of the facts 
by the police. There are 
fabrications in these reports. The 
repons state, for example , that 
Brother Jed had a banner that 
read "End Apanheid" thus 
implying that he is an anti -

apartheid evangelist. They reduce 
an altercation between those 
against apanheid and a racist 
and bigoted evangelist into a 
nonsensical and meaningless 
"fight." 

The repons manifest a racist 
attitude. The police description 
of me student central to the 
altercation, who pulled down the 
banner, is detailed. His physical 
appearance and clothing are 
inadequately described. Russell 
Andalcio is simply described as 
an angry "large black male ." 
Russell Andalcio is perceived as 
one of a mass of black (and 
hostile?) people , but the student 
is seen as human individual, a 
specific person with 
characteristics peculiar to him. 

-By isolating Russell Andalcio 
and charging him as an 
individual, the UC 
administration is attempting to 
deceive students into the belief 
that political and social 
mobilization on our campus can 
be credited to isolated 
individuals rather than to the 
students' growing collective 
consciousness of their rights and 
their united struggle for justice. 
This action of the administration 
must not be seen in isolation

from the other events on campus 
and in our society. The recent 
attack by the student 
administration, the AS, on the 
alternative media , in panicular 
the new indicator and Voz 
Fronreriza , who use the written 
word as a weapon to struwe for 
a just society, is an examPfe of 
similar repressive action to stifle 
student involvement and 
expression . Our campus has a 
hislOrv of reoression al!ainst 
students and others who struggle 
to create a fairer university ana 
society. Examples 01 this abound: 
Herben Marcuse, Angela Davis, 
UC-34, anti-CIA mobilizers, anti-
Viemam War activists, the 
struggle for the women's resource 
and daycare centers and now the 
anti-apartheid movement. Let us 
not forget this. It is necessary for 
us 10 remember our history and 
to see the present attacks as 
reflective of university policy. 

Based on our knowledge that 
the accusations against him are 
false and politically motivated , we 
demand that the universiO" 
administration drop the charges. 
We cannot allow Russell 
Andalcio to be framed .

Professor Suzanne Cahill 
J.,...t. ,f, It"J -.1', L 

This course introduces the field of 
Chinese Studies. During the spring quarter, 
we will focus on Chinese science, art and 
literature as essential parts of Chinese 
culture. Our survey will concentrate on the 
past, emphasizing elements of traditional 
China that survive today. The class will 
examine the main characteristics of 
Chinese society as they reflect the basic 
structure and motivating forces of that 
society. We will investigate Chinese 
cultural patterns in order to understand 
what makes China and the Chinese people 
special. 

In our study of Chinese science, art, and 
literature, we will read a broad range of 
materials, including both primary and 
secondary sources. Class meetings will 
consist of lectures and discussions of the 

.. 1t readings, supplemented by slides and 
-..-- . films. There are no prerequisites. There will 

be a midterm, a final, and a short term 
paper or project.

Awarding the love 
of book collecting 
By TRlSH BROWN, Staff Writer 

A N eye-catching pale-green fiyer shouts, 
"BIBUOPHILIA. " 

Underneath, more quietly, it 
confides, 'There's no cure, but it 
has its rewards. If you love 
books, we'd like to give you 
some money: 

Another brochure - hot pink 
this time - invites book lovers 
to share their passion. 

undergraduate interests also 
includes entries concerned with 
the history of and the culture of 
japan, the Old Testament, 
cetacean, the Celts , African 
explorers and philosophy of 
history. 

The 1985 first place winner 
was David QUint's collection, 
"The umismatist's Library." In 
his essay he explains that he 
began collecting both coins and 
books about them when he was 
eight years old. 

Some years seem to attract 
certain topics. In 1979, for 
example, the first prize collection 
was "The Movies," while the 
second place winner was 'The 
Cinema:" Other subjects, like 
mountameenng and science 
fiction recur again and again 
over the years. 

The purpose of the contest is 
to encourge reading and book 
collecting in undergraduates. 
Lynda Claasen , head of Special 
Collections at Central Library, 
coordinated the Book Collection 
Contest last spring. She says, "In 
this age of automation, it's nice 
to know that studens are 
reading." 

--------------------~ 

The Friends of UCSD Library 
and Chris Ferguson , contest 
coordinator, hope these clever 
little nOtices will a ttract a bevy of 
bookwonns for their 12th annual 
Book Collection Contest, open to 
all UCSD undergraduates. Prize 
money for the contest winners, 
provided by Virginia McKenzie 
Smith , is substantial - $300 first 
prize, $250 second prize and 
$200 for third place . 

Taking second prize last year 
was Brent Caner jackson's 
"Architecture" entry. He says his 
interest in architecture was 
sparked by a year spent as an 
exchange student in a Belgian 
village. 

Chris Ferguson mentions that 
when he team-taught a graduate Chris Ferguson, coordinator for the 12th annual Book Collection Contest. 

Please tum to page 9 

But don't get the idea that you 
can Just run out, buy a few books 
and call them a collection. Some 
people have tried that over the 
years, but the judges aren't 

In 1984, Cora Fried won first 
prize for her "Be aries" collection. 
She says she "discovered the 
Bearles in 1977," and began 
collecting books about the group 
after she tried to read up on 
them in the library, only to find 
that most of the books about 
them had been designated .as 
reference books which couldn't 
be checked out. Out of her 
extensive collection she chose 

Exploring 'tourist' art 
fooled . "A few people have even 
tried to enter textbooks from 
classes," fonner contest 
coordinator Marc Gittelsohn says 
with a chuckle , "but they didn't 
get very far." 

Ferguson says an entry has 
twO important elements - the 
collection itself and the 
accompanying essay, which 
includes an annotated 
bibliography. But, he says, It'S 
not so much the number of 
books in the collection or their 
intrinsic value that makes for a 
winning entry. Instead the judges 
look for an essay that shows a 
commitment to the concept of 
collecting books and a strong 
affinity for the subject 
represented by the collection. 
These qualities make for some 
inte resting essays," Ferguson 
says. 

'The winning esays of the past 
11 years range from 
mountaineering to seafaring to 
baseball and Isaac Asimov," he 
adds. 

This remarkable breadth of 

"35 of the most unusual" books 
for her contest entry. One of 
these , 60 111 ust ra ties , is printed 
entirely in Dutch. She said she 
was unaware of this when she 
bought the book, thinking "it was 
some of John's (Lennon's) 
world play. " 

Tim PickweU placed first in 
1982 with his "Baseball" 
collection . His annOtated 
bibliography would be fun to 
read, even for the non-baseball 
fan . Near the top of his list is 
The Baseball Encyclopedia, of 
which he says, "One word 
describes this book: complete." 
For Strange But True Ba.sebal/ 
Stories, he notes, "Where else 
could you read about a one-
armed major leaguer, a dog that 
ran the base paths (and was safe 
at third ) or a catcher that 
pitc hed an entire 22-inning 
game?"

reaps stability. One wants to go 
to a culture that has stability. 
This answers the question of 
why some people ·seek places 
like Africa; because it is a simple 
societal structure . 

For example, Club Med and 
certain tours feed into this 
principle . They do not show the 
tourist a complex society, rather 
they build a model civilization , a 
tropical village, isolated from the 
town and political strife. People 
do not go to island paradises 
like Fiji in order to become 
politically aware . Even in the 
past, places like Tahiti were 
never seen as "Tahiti" but rather 
as the island of love . Even in the 
18th century and 19th century 
this occurred. 

Through this search, a new 
movement has arisen. The 
"Global Village" concept brought

Book collecting 
Continued from page 8 
course at UC Irvine about a year 
ago, the other teacher said to 
him, · You know, you really 
shouldn't assign too much 
reading to these kids, because 
we're in a post-literate society 
and people don't read anymore." 

If people don't read as much 
anymore, then why do 
undergraduates collect books? 
Some students. like Daniel 
Fessler who won second prize in 
1983, have a practical answer. 
"Books," he wrote , "like skis or a 
rope, may look nice sitting on a 
shelf, but they are wholly wasted 

unless used ." Fessler, whose 
subject was mountaineering, 
described his collection as "a 
library in the fullest sense of the 
word" - a source of infonnation 
when he needed to know 
something, a source of 
entertainment when he was 
bored and a source of 
inspiration when that was 
necessary. 

Keiffer says we shouldn't 
believe any book collector who 
tells us he plans to read aD those 
volumes sitting on his shelf 
because there are probably more 
there than could be read in a 

lifetime. "For the genuine 
collector," he tells us, "cenain 
things have an intrinsic wonh 
above and beyond their use 
value." He views collecting books 
as "an an form with the collector 
being, if not an anist, then at 
least a patron.:' 

Most collectors would agree 
that the rewards are there -
both tangible and intangible. 
This year, in addition to the 
prize money donated by Mrs. 
Smith, the University Bookstore 
will provide reference books and 
discount coupons for all entrants, 
as well as 15 $10 gift cenificates.

'Volleyball hammers 
LaVerne to the spike 
By MATI UIT, Scaff Writer 

L AST TUESDAY night, the men's volleyball team had some good target practice 
time against the laVerne 
Leopards who looked more like 
siuing ducks , as UCSD picked 
them off in three straight games, 
15-4, 15-10, 15-11. 

The first game of the match 
was over in 12 minutes as the 
Tritons, the 17th ranked NCAA 
team in the nation (including 
Division I schools), crushed a 
weak laVerne team 15-4. 
laVerne resembled a bad high 
school team. They had some 
good blocks but that was with 
their faces. The only spiking the 
Leopards did must have been in 
their water bottles before the 
game. 

laVerne played better in the 

second game. Instead of looking 
like a bad high school team they 
looked like a bad coUege team. 
The Tritons shot out to a fast 7-3 
lead, helped by five straight 
service points by senior Howard 
Bishop. The Leopards made a 
noble attempt to come back, 
getting as close as 9-7 , but they 
were soon knocked down by the 
powelful hitting of freshman 
Christian Carpenter who led the 
team, along with Scott Criswell, 
with eight kills. laVerne went 
down 15-10 .. 

Freshman Christian Carpenter 
and ScOtt Hurst, who were 
'teammates in high school, 
received the starting call for the 
Tritons. Coach Digger Graybill 
was quite pleased with their 
performances, saying, "Carpenter 

IS a nne , fmc player and a good 
hustler. Hurst also did real well 
for us tonight." 

The third game was the closest 
in the match. UCSD tallied up 
six points before laVerne scored. 
With the score 10-3 the 
Leopards made a tough 
comeback, tying the game at 10-
10. The tie caused the Triton 
timeout, UCSD regrouped 
enough to go on and win the 
game and the match 15-11. 

Tnton outSide hitting star, 
Cott McGregor, did not play 

because he missed a practice 
dunng the week and accordmg 
to coach Graybill's rules, if a 
player misses a practice he 
misses the game. McGregor is 
scheduled to play Wednesday 
night against Long Beach City 
College. 

"laVerne was not as tall as us. 
We outmatched them 
individually," said Graybill, 'but 
we still had some breakdowns. 
We served fairly well . We have 
~ to be concerned with what 
;;: happens on our side of the 
ji court ." 
-; On their side of the coun the 
~ Tritons had 36 kills, 12 errors, 

~ 27 zeros for a percentage of .320 
compared to the Leopards' 29 
kills , 24 errors, 36 zeros for a 
percentage of .052. 

The Tri tons next home game 
will be Feb. 28 against a tough 
Penn State team who is rated 
10th in the nation . Currently the 
Tritons are 10-6. ~

Baseball sweeps WCC, 
stulllbles at State 
By JOHN SCHACHT,. Spans Editor 

I F THERE'S such a thing as being 100 up for a game. then the UCSD Tritons might as 
well never schedule their 
crosstown rivals at San Diego 
State again. The Aztecs parlayed 
five errors - and a "handful of 
mental errors," according to 
coacr Lyle Yates - into a 7-3 
win last Tuesday night at Smith 
field. 

"There's something about 
playing these guys that makes us 
nervous," said Yates. ' I don't 
know if it's the crosstown rivalry 
or the home-field advantage (the 
Aztecs play at night); but even 
though we know it's just another 
game against a good team , we 
still have these mental lapses." 
Two stats stick out like bad hop 
grounders to back this up. Before 
Tuesday night's erroneous 
performance, UCSD had made a 
total of six errors in eight games. 
Perhaps more indicative, against 
State , the Tritons gave up six 
unearned runs in three innings 
early in the game - aU of them 
with two out in each inning. 

Staner Frank Califano took the 
hard luck loss in five innings of 
work, and Casey Morales 
finished up. "They got a lot of 
Oares m tonight (SD5U had 10 
hits to UCSD's six)," said Yates. 

, 

"and we hit a lot of 'a t 'em' balls, 
but they had us defensed well . 
They had a hard thrower on the 
mound and they plugged the left 
centerfield alley. We couldn't get 
anything in there." Bob atal 
had a long home run (his 4th) 
and upped his RBI total to 14. 

Over the 3-day weekend , the 
Triton's broke a doubleheader 
second-game scoring drought as 
they swept a pair from Division 
III West Coast Christian College 
9-1 and 16-3 at Olsen field . 

UCSD pounded out 28 hits in 
the doubleheader. Bob Natal hit 
his third homer of the year and 
picked up four RBI's; Derek 
Alkonis hit his first round -tripper 
of the year and went 3-4 in the 
second game; and Dave 
Stanovich collected four hits and 
three stolen bases from the 
leadoff spot in the nightcap. 
Newcomer Brian Rude went 3-4 
with five RBI's in the second 
game. 

Sophomore Teny Beck pitched 
four innings of the seven-inning 
first game to get the win and 
Dave Adamson pitched three 
shutout innings of relief to 
record the save. Junior Paul 
Burke was the recipient of a six-
run second in game rwo and 
evened his season mark at I-l.~

The Don Juan Project, 
which played at Mandell 
Weiss Center last week, was 
an outlandish but delightful 
mix of styles and characters. 
The director, designers, cast 
and crew dished out the 
unbelievable, and yet 
somehow made it believable 
in all its bizarre extremity. It 
was a work of ambitious 
intention and radical delivery. 
Elements of opera mixed with 
dramatic stagecraft, while 
vaudevillian pratfalls shared 
the stage with masks and 
comedia del arte clowning. If 
one could accept all these 
variant ingredients, it made 
for quite a heady concoction. 

To begin with, everything 
was reversed. The audience 
sat up on the stage, looking 
out over the playing area, into 
the darkened auditorium. 
Center stage was a great tilted 
slab between the band (five 
piece, rock) and a piece of hell 
(concen tration camp?). 
Across the tilted space, Don 
Juan ran down the last hours 
of his life. 

An Arts Magazine Serving the UCSD Community ;' ~~ . 
, • f February 20.1986 Volume 12. Number 6 v. 

'Many of the characters, the 
majority, in fact, appeared in 
masks. This practice achieved 
a varying success. Don juan's 
valet, played by Craig Green, 
appeared somewhat stifled by 
his masking. Perhaps his role 
demanded the subtlety of his 
face, which could not be 
delivered from behind an 
unchanging mask. In contrast, 
the simpler characters of the 
country people lent them-
selves very well to masking, 
their unchanging faces 
reflecting their simple, rather 
stupid personalities. Their 
masks were like caricatures of 
their characters, and their 
movements showed how 
simple they were, behind the 
masks. Yet, these movements 
could range from the sublime 
to the ridiculous, as when a 
farm girl explains to her 
farmboy admirer just why 
Don Juan is kissing her up and 
down the neck. 

Don Juan himself, rather 
lusciously played by Randy 
Braunberger, was without 
ma.sk through the first acts of

the play. Only at the end, 
when he decides to pretend 
reform, does he assume a 
mask, a horrifying white face , 
of hypocrisy. This was an 
powerful touch, emphasizing 
that whereas Don Juan before 
was simply bad, now he 
became truly evil. Before, he 
had not pretended to be good, 
now he would milk his 

"r~fo[m" for all it was worth. 
Hell itself lay under the first 

row of seats, through steel 
grates that opened , down 
under the stage. Steel stairs 
came up from there into the 
side of the stage, where barbed 
wire and metal grills held the 
slowly moving forms of 
torture victims or concentra-
tion camp captives, whatever 
the hell they were supposed to 
be. And you can guess who 
got sent there in the end, 
leaving his valet screaming 
"My wages! My wages! You 
haven't paid me my wages!" 

To dissect the project 
would be to attempt to , 
separate and ' lay bare the 
different elements of desigt:l 

and direction that moved the roll interludes and Moliere 
show. But, in the reality ofthe could fit together, but they

Rabbit Food? Hah!

Lettuce has long been given a bad name. Often called bland, wilted or, 
worse still, roughage (an incredibly unsavory term), those leafy greens 
have long been relegated to the back burner of diet city. But listen up all 
you carnivores, because only when you get past your vegetable inhibitions 
will you be able to participate in a culinary experience of a lifetime - a 
iarden patch bonanza, if you will. 

Soup Exchange, more commonly known as salad heaven, is located at 
7305 Claire mont Mesa Blvd. To the regular dinner-salad eater, at first 
sight Soup Exchange can be a tad bit intimidating. The charming ambiance 
of the resta'urant is not what's scary. The two long lines of salad 
smorgasboard can be a little overwhelming for a first-timer. Ah, but those 
choices are what make Soup Exchange the Salad King of Clairemont. The 
lettuce itself pales in comparision to the awesome array of olives, 
mushroom and artichoke marinate, tomatoes, guacamole, onions,

cheese; incredible homemade croutons, delectable dressings, trail mix .. . 
ecstasy. I can't go on. Actually, I can becuase what lies beyond the salad 
spread in equally appetizing. The soup they ladel out is hearty (yes, better 
than Campbell's) and very warming. But, oh, the crowning glory of this 
meal is the muffins. Freshly baked and enticingly aromatic are the 
blueberry, sour cream and peaches, pumpkin and corn muffins. The in-
season fruit bar and the strawberry shortcake dessert are worth any Friday 
or Saturday night wait. 

The Soup Exchange offers pleasant patio seating (equipped with 
winter-time heaters) in addition to its calming interior design. A 
combination of soup and unlimited trips to the salad bar is $5 .95; salad 
alone is $4.95 and soup alone is $4.35. Hours are 11:00 am·9:30 pm 
Monday through Sunday.· Besides· the Clairemont location (576-0622), 
there are Soup Exchanges at 8072 La Mesa Blvd., La Mesa (697-8561); 
and 660 University Ave (296-4030).

In !Click Song, one of 
Williams' recent novels (of 
which he has written 10) a 
passage describes the problem 
confronted by Black writers: 

"Say," he said, " what made you send 
your poems to Wc W and not to 
someone like Lan~ton Hughes!" Sa ys Professor Farrell newspapers in which her

the nationwide celebration is Some Changes: 

I said, " I went down to see Hughes 
the last time 1 was in New York." 

He sat upright in the booth where we 
were drinking beer. A distance seemed 
to grow in his eyeso " What'd he say?" 

1 told him what Mr. Hughes had told 
me about my work - exaggerating ever 
so slightly. (1 didn't tell him what else 
Mr. Hughes said because I didn ' t want 
to believe it and 1 wouldn't foraet it 
either: I would have to be ten times the 
writer a white man was and then it 
would he hell, which was not exactly 

to emp~asize and give UhuTU in the O.R. 
recognition to black 
achievement. This includes, as 
Foreman says, an emphasis on 
both "the cultural and the 
academic side."

he will be reading from his
