upset over Action 
endorsements 
By BRENT HECHT 
Staff Writer 

Some members of the Students 
First slate are objecting to the Action 
slate's endorsements of three nldents 
First candidates. 

Navneet Grewall, the Action-
endorsed Snldents First ca ndidate for 
commissioner of communications, 
claimed that these unsolici ted plaudits 
confuse students as to which slate she 
and the two other Action-endorsed 
candidates belong. 

"I don't want to be associated with a 
slate I don't believe in ," Grewall sa id . 
"Yam running on the Srudents First 
late because I believe it has the best 

candidates ... I'd rather nOl have the 
IActionl publicity." 

T he endorsements appear on 
Action's brochures and on a poster in 
the Student Center.

UC recalls EAP 
students from Israel 
Escalating violence in Middle East 
cited as reason behind DCOP move 
By CLAIRE J. VANNmE 
Senior Staff Writer 

In light of escalating violence in 
the Middle East, seven UCSD stu-
dents currently sUidying abroad in 
Israel have been call ed back to the 
United tates, the University of 
California Office of the President 
announced on Tuesday. 

There are 27 UC students 
studying in Israel this semester. 
The C Education Abroad 
Program has asked Lha rhe stu-
dents' names not be released. 

"The No. I priority h:ls always

pokesperson I Ianan Eisenman. 

AJI tbe students have been con-

said, ranging from pUfchJsing :lIT-

"\Ne :Ire encouraging them to

Student reactions mixed 
about 'Most' campaign 
Student Safety Awareness Program 
hopes posters will help prevent rape 
By ALEX J. LEE 
Senior Staff Writer 

Plans to modify the Student 
Safety Awareness Program's rape 
prevention campaign are underway, 
according to program director 
Nancy Wahlig. 

The most visible part of the cam-
paign is its posters, which read: "Two 
out of three UCSD guys rarely or 
never have sex with a partner who 
has been drinking." 

Wahlig said student reaction to 
the campaign was mixed. 

Muir senior Trevor Tan said he 
favors the campaign. 

"It's a good idea to raise aware-
ness on campus about the etiquette 

of respecting other people and not 
taking advantage of Lhem," Tan said. 
"However, it's hard for me to believe 
that most guys would avoid having 
sex just because their partner is 
drunk, especially considering how 
lax most college snldents are aboul 
getting drunk. r don't know how 
effective these posters are, but it' a 
good start for this campaign." 

Revelle junior Mike Tolleth said 
he found the message cryptic and 
had no idea it was ta!geted toward 
guys. 

"I thought it was targeted to girls 
to discourage them from drinking," 
Tolleth sa id.

Israel: 
Students were made aware of 
potential risks in Israel 
Continued from page 1 

to remain in Israel. In that case, they 
would be responsible for enrolling 
themselves directly in their host uni-
versity and then working with their 
deans and provosts to be readmitted 
to the University of California and to 
earn transfer credi t for coursework 
completed in Israel. 

"We understand this is an inconve-
nience, bur we'll do everything possi-
ble to make it as smooth as possible," 
Eisenman said. 

Eisenman was unable to say 
whether all of the students would 
return to the United States. 

"I know some will come back," he 
said. "It may be that some will stay. n 

He stressed that no UC student 
has ever been in danger in Israel, and 
all are in fact "safe and sound. n 

EAP director John Markham has 
been monitoring the situation in 
Israel closely, and traveled there last 
April to decide whether this year's 
programs should go ahead. 

At that point, Markham said, he 
felt the safety measures then in place 
were adequate and students were 
made aware of the situation into 
which they were headed. 

UCSDs Programs Abroad Office 
and EAP director Kim Burton said 
that all students traveling abroad 
attend both a general information ses-
sion with safety information and trav-
el tips, and a country-specific session. 

The unrest in Israel w"as "most def-
initely taken very seriously, n Burton 
said, and a special orientation was 
held for UC smdents headed there. 

Markham met face to face with most 
students going to Israel, and spoke with 
a few others over the phone. 

"We told them we would share 
everything we know and, as adults, 
they could make their own decisions," 
he said. 

Students who were apprehensive 
or fearful after being apprised of the 
rigorous safety measures required by 
EAP were encouraged not to attend. 
Several students elected not to go 
after attending the orientation. 

Some restrictions were require-
ments, such as not traveling to the 
West Bank, Gaz..1 Strip or cerrain areas 
of Jerusalem; some SU'ong advice, like 
not riding huses or going to cafes or 
m~rkcrplaces. Smdents sigm:u :I waiver 
'tating they understood tile risks inher-
ent in going to Israel and that violating 
safety ruJes could lead to dismissal. 

"" 'c cou ldn 't guarantee that this 
would be safe," .vlarkham said. 
"Absolute safety isn't in Los Angeles, 
San Diego, anywhere." 

He did say that students in Israel 
have been "visibly affected" by the 
growing violence. 

l\Jarkllam cited recent suicide 
bombings as the cause of the decision 
to recall students. 

"The whole combin ation of events 
is spinni ng out of control," hc ~aicl. 
"There was hope that the peace 
process would gu ahead with the Visits 
of [C;cneral Anthony) Zinni and [Vice 
Prcmlem Di ck] Chene}', but instead it 
wel1l the opposite direction ." 

The programs in Israel have also 
been >uspended for the fall semc ter 
pending an improvement in Israel: 
Eisenman sa Id. lvI, kham said the 
deci~ion to remstate .e pr~grams will 
be a compl ex one, aying, " It \vill be a 
judgment call: Has violence subsided 
is the peace process moving forwarci 
H' that snldents would be safe?" 

In the past, unrest a broad has led 
to UC ,rudents being called hack to 
the 'nited tates. The Israel pro-
g~'III~S ,were. suspended during the 
(,ult \ \ ar, Eisenman s,liu, "when .,cud 
mls, ile, were coming down on Israel." 

Abu, srudents were called back 
from China in the wake of the 
Tiananman Square confrontations, 
and programs in India were recently 
suspended beca use of increasing hos-
tility between India and Pakista n. 

Eisenman would not say whether 
otf]er EAP programs are being moni-
tored for safety or may poSSibly face 
suspension in the future . 

"This is the only decision we're 
making right now," he said.

Slate: 
Th ird party criticizes 
bickenng of other two 
Continued from page 1 

"They are tricking the smdenr 
body," she said . "The whole 
[Sl11dents First) slatc is very con-
cerned about the issue." 

Action slate's presidcntial candi -
date, Colin Parent, said his slate 
chose to endorse member of a rival 
slate because Action's leadershi p 
wants to "avoid the worst of slate 
politics. " 

"Instead of enlisting inexperi-
enced space-fillers for our slate, we 
want to endorse the best candidate 
for the job. even if that means help-
ing ou t individual members of 
another slate," Parel1l said. 

Parent said he talked wi th 
Students First prior to endorsing 
the candidates. I Ie also said the two 
slates agreed that to avoid confu-
sion, all Action promotional mate-
rials would display footnote-based 
disclaimers signaled by asterisks 
beside the names of non-Action 
candidates. 

"[Grewall) has the right to feel 
how she wants to feel, but the bot-
tom line is that we agreed before-
hand on the disclaimer," Parent 
said. 

Grewall said Action never 
showed Students First the tem-
plate; Students First only discov-
ered the template when it was 
passed around at a Triton Athletes 
forum held in March . 

She and the other two Action-
supported Students First candi-
dates, commissioner of diversity 
candidate David Mitchell and 
Roo evelt sophomore senator can-
didate Desiree Jabson, confronted 
Action members and demanded 
that the Student~ First name be 
placed by all endorsements of 
members of her slate. 

"After we confronted them, 

Action said it was too la te to do 
what we asked and decided that the 
asterisks would be a compromise," 
Grewall said. 

Grewall also pointed out that 
the Action poster in the Student 
Center that states "Action supports 
Navneet Grewall" makes no men-
tion of her affiliation with Students 
First. 

Parent explained his slate's rea-
soning: "To put another slate's 
name on our materials is a little 
ridiculous," he said. 

As Action and Snldents First 
duke it out, the two other presiden-
tial candidates on slates claim that 
this is evidence of politics as usual 
at UCSD. 

New Wave slate presidential 
candidate Dave Hansen said slates 
endorsing other slates shows the 
effects of the A.S. "establishment" 
on the Action and Snldents First 
slates. 

"In my opinion, Action endors-
ing Students First shows they both 
are part of the establishment and 
toO . simi lar," he said. "They 
wouldn't endorse us because we 
have original and independent 
ideas." 

Together Our Goals Are 
Ach.ievable, or TOGAA, slate pres-
idential candidate Phil Palisoul 
called the endorsement a "gim-
mick" by Action to divert attention 
away from its lack of candidates. 
He said TOGM's goal for a coali-
tion on A.S. Council of all slates, as 
he doesn't like how the campaign is 
being run. 

"I don't know why Students 
First is so pissed," he said. "It's friv-
olous bulls - that has been part of 
this election since day one." 

Despite the maneuvering, many 
students remain apathetic to the 
upcoming elections. 

Marshall fifth-year Michelle 
Lee and Warren freshman Ryan 
Marshall said their political stance 
remained the same: "I don't vote," 
each said .

Lieberknecht said the money 
raised by the Muir referendum 
would go toward "entrenching the 
Muirstock program," a new bud-
get line-i tem for diversity pro-
grams, Muir organizations and all-
campus organizations. 

Ke ll y said that the current 
Marshall council has been dis-
cussing "a large Marshall carni-
val-type event" in light of the 
Marshall fee referendum's suc-
cess. 

Poveing was unavailable for 
comment. 

The candidates said that they 
were going to focus on funding 
college-specific programs instead 
of A.S. and campuswide pro-
grams. 

"I also want ERC to have a 
bigger influence on campus," 
Nandagopal said. 

According to Nandagopal, 
Roosevelt will gain prestige next 
year when it moves to a new cam-
pus. 

Kelly said he wants to make 
Marshall as "great" and "unified" 
as possible. He said he "will defi-
nitely put the needs of Marshall 
first," in preference to A.S. and 
all -campus programs and organi-
zations. 

"We want to be the best col-
lege," Lieberknecht said of 
Muir. 

The candidates said their prior 
experience serving on their 
respective councils or the A.S. 
Council prepared them for the 
position of council chair. 

"You learn the rules by going 
to all these meetings," 
Nandagopal said. "I'm also 
involved in some organizations." 

Kelly said that through his 
experience as director of finance, 
he has worked with all the 
Marshall organizations and thus is 
qualified to be council chair. 

"j know them each very well 
and I know what eaeh one c1oes," 
Kelly said. 

Lieberkneeht said th at being 
A.S. senate chair gave him 
" familiariry with ening the 
agenda" and experience with the 
debate process. 

Each candidate talked about 
specific issues they want to address 
as college council chai rs. 

'I t would have provided 
a bit more legitimacy. It 

would have been nice 
to have a chance to 
prove myself in the 

election ... I do 
appreciate the fact 
that I will win, that 

"abstain" won't beat 
me.' 

- Kevin Kelly 
Marshall director of finance 

Lieberknecht, who is a mem-
ber of the Muirtastic slate, said the 
slate wanted to examine Muir's 
general education requirements 
and the way the Muir College 
Wri ting Program treats transfer 
students. 

"Our slate has talked about 
taking a very critical look at Muir 
40 or 50, or some of the grading 
policies of them, n Lieberknecht 
said . 

Nandagopal said tha parr of his 
job as council chair is to "make sure 
morale remains high and every-
thing is focused" whilr~ the council 
undergoes some structural changes.

Kelly said that he would have 
preferred to run against someone 
else for the position of cOllncil

"It would have provided a 1)1[

election ... I do appreciate th e fact 
that I will win, that 'abstain ' won 't

Nandagopal said he \Va both 
relieved and disappointed when 
he learned he was running unop-

"By running against someone 
and winning, you gain some 
credibility, like, ' I deserve thi ,'" 
Nandagopal said . " ince the 
majority of the council is fresh-
men, that's probably the reason 
why I'm running unopposed ... 
The position, I feel, would be 
better done by a person who i, 
higher up, or has more seninTl -

Lieberknecht said Muir Stu-
dents probably wouldn 't learn as 
much about Muir or about the

was little competition in Muir

"There's not a lot ro decide

Political slates 
may confuse and 
mislead voters 

With the A.5. elections season in full 
sll'i~~, 01:111Y like-minded group~ of candi-
(!,ltl;S - sLltes - h:lVe made their presence 
felt .a t UCSD In the last several weeks. Over 
haH ;J dozen slates are vying for undergrad-
u;lte snldents' votes, ea~n attempting to 
demonstrate that Its particular lineup will 
pro\'~ the most advantageous for mindfully 
ca.rrylng out th~ responsibilities associa ted 
II'lth A.5. Council .and senate positions. 

Howe\'e r, the Importance of truly stu-
dent-relevant election issues has been all but 
lost as students drown. in the plethora of 
slate-produced flyers, banners and media all 
over cmnpus. The Gllrmlir/71 believes that 
\\'~ile slates may increase visibility for blocks 
of A .. S. Council candidates, they are unnec-
~ssan ly burdensome and detract from the 
Issues of real concern for the electorate. 

A 51.ate's existential ~oal is to get itself _ 
all of ItS members - elected to student O'ov-
ernment. The 2000-200 I Unity slate's phe-
nomena.1 sweep of all ballot positions shows 
u.nquestIonably that this Can be achieved. A 
slIlgle-mlllded body politic, however, com-
pletely undermll1es the notion of the com-
petitive marketplace of ideas. "When all 
members of an elected council come into 
oHlce with .the ~ame i~eological stance and 

g~a l s, the diverSity of dissent is lost. Internal 
~ntlqlle and the mutabi lity of ideas, so 
Impo.rtant to a democratically minded orga-
n~zatlOn, IS threatened if there is little or no 
disagreement on matters. 

The tendency of slate organizers is to bal-
ance as best they can the need for a diverse 
group of candidates with those who would 

~e the most appropriate for the elected posi-
~Ions . Slates, naturally concerned with the 
IInag~"'ley project to the public, may have 
the u~lfo~tunate ten.dency .to skimp on the 
qualdlcatlons of their candidates in favor of 
presen?ng a slate With. a particular makeup. 
A slate s dnvll1g force IS the unified front it 
presents, making it imperarive that a slate 
adv~l~ce candidates for most or all of the 
posltl?ns .uP for grabs at an election. 

It IS ~Ighly imaginative to suppose that 
any p,artJcuiar slate, no matter its cfaims, can 
pOSSibly nUI~lber among. its membership the 
best and bnghtest candidate for each posi-
tIOn .. The rush to fi nd simi larly disposed 
candIdates, though, ma y result in the 

~~rtlltment of th?s~who .are n.o~ the most 
suitable for an A.s. Lolin 1I1>0s1Oon. These 
candl~at~s may neverth,el~ss help to reduce

UCSD administration enforces unfair 
alcohol regulations on campus 

Students' rights are viola!e~ by ~ stringent, 
overzealous admInIstratIon 

By IYAN DARBY 
Senior Staff Writer 

My name is Darby, and [have a prob-
lem ... or so one might think, knowing 
that I had to take a mandatory alco hol 
awareness class. Thatl; right, the sa me 
guy who wrote an article tel ling fresh-
men how to discretely party on campus 
got caught. Not that it's a big deal ; at the 
very least, I thought, I could come away 
WIth orne more drinking buddies. 
. The class reall y wasn't that bad , 

either. [ especially enjoyed watching the 
documentary on Tijuana nightlife and 
the instructors gave us some really'tasty 
loll ipops. 

What I found absolurely intriguing, 
however, was the resident security officer 
~ho described his job and fielded ques-
tions, largely pertaining to the rights we 
have as on-campus residents, or more 
accurately, what rights we don 't have. 

I was shocked to di scover the impuni-
ty that RSOs have in entering and 
searching residents' dorms and apart-
ments. First of all, there are apparently 
no rules or requirements governing the 
Circumstances for which RSOs kn ock on 
someone's door; it 's totally at their own 
discretion, or if you prefer, whim. 

Second, once the resident opens the 
door, the RSO doesn't even have to see 
any indi cation of alcohol; he ca n ask to 
enter the room or aparrment, ag'lin, at 
his own discretion. 

As. provocative as this sound , it 's not 
t?O different fr~m the rules, if not prac-
tice, of real police officers. ~at is dif-
ferent and very disnlrbing, however, are 
the consequences the resident faces, 
should he or she decide not to open the 
door or all ow the RSO to enter. The 
RSO cannot enter an aparnnent or dorm 
w~thour the resident's permission, but he 
Will promptly write a report to be hand-
ed III to the local resident dean for 
review. 

The housi ng contract clearly states 
th.at residents must completely cooperate 
With RSOs; therefore, even if there is no 
eVidence whatsoever that the resident or 
guests have been drinking, to deny an 

RSO permission to enter is an offense 
punishable by eviction. 

That's right! Screw the Fourth 
Amendment; UCSD's attorneys have 

fou~d a way to side-step it by having the 
option to eVict students should they not 
"vo luntarily" allow RSOs to enter their 
rooms and search their possessions. 
Regardless of legality, this is as close to 
an illegal search and seizure as it gets 
and the students here should not tolerat~ 
it anymore. 

Another RSO right that leaves a bad 
taste in my mouth is that they can enter 

The administration goes so 
far out of its way to 

prevent students from 
partying on campus for 

the same reason it doesn't 
care about advancing 

athletics: It really doesn't 
care about the 

undergraduates here. All 
Chancellor Robert Dynes 

and company care about is 
UCSD as a research school. 

a room or apartment without permission 
I~ the~ feel a resident may be in danger. 
[m dIsturbed because this is such an 
ambiguous rule that an RSO can, if he 
chooses, enter even if no one is in any 
kind of danger, because he "thought" he 
heard an indication of danger. 

I also think it's ridiculous that the 
alcohol contract states that the guests of 
residents • . even if they are 21 years old, 
cannot drmk. ~at is the big deal? As 
long as no one under 21 is drinking no 
laws are being broken. ' 
. , Thi~ is technically a wet campus, but 
Its policed like a dry campus. Once, 
Round Table carded me when I tried to 
buy a nonalcoholic beer. So why does the 
school care' Just so it has one more tool to 

use in its holy crusade against college 
drinking. 

This crusade doesn't stop at alcohol 
and whatever other controlled sub-
stances a re ident chooses to use, either. 
The libertarian part of me is rea lly 
angry that I am literally forced to allow 
a couple of rubber billy clubs to search 
my property without just cause' if a 
policeman wants to search your p:oper-
ty, he can't do so unless he acquires a 
search warrant signed by a judge. If an 
RSO wants to sea rch my backpack, why 
should I get In trouble for saying, "No, 
the contents of my backpack are none of 
your business. " What makes RSOs so 
special that they're protected with such 
privileges? 
. The admjnistration goes so far out of 
Its way to prevent students from parrying 
on campus for the sa me reason it doesn't 
care about advancing athletics: It really 
doesn't care about the undegraduates 
here. 

All Chancellor Robert Dynes and 
company ca re about is UCSD as a 
research school. A respectable under-
gra~uate program is merely a plus. and in 
reality a consequence of the high-profile 
research that takes place here. 

They don't care if RSOs march 
around ca mpus like Nazi storm troopers, 
pestermg students about noi se and alco-
hol whi le our cars are being vandalized in 

~e parking lots they should be patrolling 
Instead. 

The only way the admirustration will 
ever care about student life on campus is 
if we the students finally stand up for 
ourselves and let them know loud and 
clear that we will not be pushed around 
any ~ore. ~ ~oup.le of years ago, the 
American CIVlI Liberties Union sued 
UCSD for violating residents' First 
Amendment rights, and it won. It is only 
because of that that we're allowed to post 
whatever we choose in our windows 
even if the administration doesn't like it' 

['m no legal expert, but I sure bet th~ 
~CLU and other watchdog organiza-
tions would like to know that UCSD is 
disregarding our Fourth Amendment 
rights.

Editor: 
I am writing this letter on behalf 

of the UC students participating in 
the one-year Education Abroad 
Program in Jerusalem, Israel. I am 
not the voice of the students, nor do 
I claim to be. However, I feel this 
letter represents how we aU feel. 

We have been briefed that the 
UC offices are considering sus-
pending the program. All of us 
acknowledge that this is a very trou-
bled time, and that YOIIT concerns 
for our safety are well-placed. But 
lor some of us here, this year means 
more than just studying abroad. 
When we turned in our applications 
the lntifada was raging. We knew 

what we were getting into. For 
many of us, Israel stands at the core 
of OIlT belief system and we are hon-
ored to be here at this time, to show 
our support by continuing to live 
here. 

Dr. Marcwn acknowledged in 
the Contra Costa TrmtS that "among 
the concerns is that many students 
in Israel are intent on remaining 
there even if the university pulls 
out." In light of this fact, we can' 
help but ask ourselves: Why is the 
wUversity abandoning us? 

Th ~ UC system has made 
retumi.1g home early as painless as 
possibl.!. Those students who 
wished to go home have gone 
home, and they are very apprecia-
tive of the level of understanding 
and compassion that the UC system 
has shown. Bur we, the remaining 
students, would like to ask that you 
continue to let us make 01lT own 
decisions whether to stay or not. 

OIlT lives here are definitely 
filled with emotional ups and 
downs. We have stresses in 01lT lives 
that are uruque to our study 
center. We fear going to certain 
places at certain times and the 
sow1d of every ambulance siren still 
affects us. With these concerns in 
our lives what we need most is not a 
parental-like decision being forced 
upon us, but the UC system to 
stand behind us. 

We are asking that you stop 
being yet another stress in our lives 
and begin supporting us. If we want 
to go home, continue to support 
that, and if we want to stay, support 
that too. Do not make our lives 
harder by abandoning us. Stand 
behind us. Be the institutional sup-
port that we are longing for.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

speak up, 
speak out 

O n the first day of my Physics 8 
class, my professor said 
"Two students no longer 
go to this school 
because they pla~ia­
rized in my last class. 

The professor then went on to 
further break down what was con-
sidered cheating, such as submitting 
work that is not solely yours or has 
not been properly attributed. 

I applaud this professor for 
being so up-front about what is 
acceptable and unacceptable behav-
ior in the course, and clearly 
ellplaining the consequences -
possible expulsion from college. 

The consequences for being 
found guilty of academic dishonesry 
are catastrophic and life-altering. 
Expulsion has far-reaching conse-
quences: After being expelled from 
college, attending medical school 
and becoming a doctor is virtually 
unattainable. The fact that you were 
expelled from school for cheating 
will be on YOIIT transcript for life. 
You'll forever go through life brand-
ed a cheater and a dishonest person. 

Because the cost is so high of 
being found guilty of academic dis-
honesty in the college world , it is 
paramount that strict adherence to 
the academic integrity policy is fol-
lowed by both professors and sru-
dents. The burden of accountabili-
ty cannot be carried solely by the 
students on JUSt knowing what is 
acceptable and unacceptable 
behavior. 

Thus, the actions of my phy.;ics 
professor on the first day of class 
about what constitutes cheating and

the consequences themselves must 
be modeled by all professors so tha t 
all students are given a fair and equal 
chance to learn. 

Instead of saying what is consid-
ered plagiarism halfway through the 
course when there have already been 
two cases of plagiarism, as it hap-
pened in my political science classes 
last quarter, professors must emulate 
the example of my physics professor. 

Some may argue that it isn't all 
that difficult for a student to know 
what is considered cheating and pla-
giarism, or that students "just know" 
that it is moraUy wrong to cheat. 

Obviously, cheating is wrong and 
must be prevented at all costs so that 
the academic integrity of learning is 
preserved for aU students. But the 
fact remains that not everything in 
the academic world is crystal clear 
and free of ambiguity. Beyond the 
obvious examples of cheating on 
exams or turning in work that is not 
your own, policies regarding collabo-
ration and citing of research differ by 
department and professor. 

For instance, in my physics class, 
the professor encolITaged collabora-
tion of ideas and thoughts as long as 
the assi gnment turned in was the stu-
dent's own work. Yet in other depart-
ments, aU collaboration is considered 
a fonn of cheating. 

Because there are such diverse 
policies regarding collaboration and 
plagiarism throughout the different 
departments, it is crucial that the uni-
form policy of the academic dishon-
esty Policy and the Instructors' 
Guide for Preventing and Proces ing 
Incidents of Academic Dishonesty be 
followed without deviance. 

According to the Instructors' 
Guide for Preventing and 
Processi ng Incidents of Acadelruc 
Dishonesty, issued by the Office of 
Student Policies and Judicial 
Affairs, professors must "state in 
writing the kinds of aid 'and collab-
oration that are allowed and not 
allowed in their courses. " 

And under the instructors' 

OPINION S 

responsibility section of the 
Academic Dishonesty Policy, protes-
sors are urged to "state the objectives 
and requirements of each collrse at 
the beginning of the tenn ." 

The students' rcsponsi bili ty 
under the Academic Dishonesry 
Policy is "to complete the cour~e In 
compli ance with the instructor ':; 
standards. 0 student shall engage in 
any activiry that involves attempting 
to receive a grade by means other 
than honest effort." • 

It is clear that the students' 
responsibility is to complete the 
cl ass in compl iance with the 
instructor's tandards and that the 
responsibility of the professors is to 
inform the students at the begin-
ning of th e course uf what kinds of 
collaboration are allowed and what 
constitutes cheating. 

Yet, as we all go to our firsl week 
of classes, in how many of our classes 
can we rea lly say that the professor is 
following these policies to the letter) 

In my last three years at UCSD, 
only about two-thirds of my profes-
sors have stated their policies toward 
academic dishonesty. 

If we as students are to be held 
accountable to academic integrity 
policy in its entirety, then 0 too 
must professors be held equa lly 
accountable. 

Thus, it is evident that the 
blame for students cheating doe~­
n't solely rest on the shoulders of 
the smdems, but also on the shoul-
ders of the faculty to clearly state 
what constitutes cheati ng at the 
beginning of every course. 

This wide chasm between the 
stated polices of academic dishonesty 
and the irregular implementation of 
them by professors must be bridged 
wi th mict adherence of the policies. 

Equality under the rules and 
policies of academic dishonesty 
must be established. Our universiry 
cannot survive an academic world 
where there are two sets of rules: 
One for the professors and one for 
the students.

Most: 
Wahlig gives many 
UCSD males credit 
Continued from page 1 

Revelle sophomore Pamela 
Rahn said the ambiguity of tlle 
message lends itself to parody. 

"It's easy to twist tht! message," 
Rahn said. "The message is not 
too strong and I know many peo-
ple on campus who've mude fun of 
it. " 

One student who derided the 
poster campaign during an on-cam-
pus open mic night last quarter was 
Warren sophomore Reid Barren, 
who said the statistic was mislead-
ing. 

"It's hard to tell whether it's say-
ing we're doing good or we're 
doing bad," Barrett said. "If the 
purpose of this is to say that UCSD 
guys aren't good about keeping 
their dicks in their pants, should we 
really put them in public places on 
campus where campus tours come 
in on campus? Plus, the photo looks 
a bit ridiculous; it's just a very car-
toonish photo." 

Despi te the mixed reviews, the 
campaign was still effective in ful-
filling its original intent, according 
to Wahlig. 

"It has started discussion, which 
is certainly what we wanted to do 
with the grant so men could start 
talking \vith each other," she said. 

The campaign's Statistics,

to honor Mexican activist

including the one on the first 
poster, wen: tabulated from a sur-
vey distributed last year to 4,000 
UCSD males, 831 of which were 
renlfncd. 

Questions ranged from the par-
ticipants' own sexual habits to their 
perceptions about the sexual activi-
ty of others. Among the greatest 
misperceptions me campaign 
anempted to clear up were tho e 
UCSD males had about the behav-
ior of their peers. 

"What we found is thaI most 
UCSD guys have a lot of facts and 
information that is correct about 
the issue of rape," Wahlig said. 
"Their behavior is very positive, 
but we did find that there's a lot of 
misperceptions about other 
UCSD males; most people believe 
that most UCSD guys would have 
sex with somebody who is drunk." 

The program's assistant coordi-
nator Jeff Holt emphasized that the 
campaign intended to praise 
UCSD men. 

"We're trying to get the mes-
sage out there that there are mis-
perceptions among the males and 
females and to actually tell the guys 
that they're doing a good job," Holt 
said. 

The program is unique because 
it is one of the few positive cam-
paigns geared specifically toward 
men, according to Holr. In addi-
tion, its organizers have made many 
efforts to get feedback from campus 
to figure out what is effective. Plans 
are underway to clarify confusion

over the existing posters. 
"We're already trying to correct 

those," Holt said . "I wouldn't look 
at it like we're replacing the posters, 
because we were already planning 
on putting different ones up to add 
to the campai gn, making littl e 
changcs on the way." 

[f students are still unclear about 
the campaign or its message they 
are encouraged to contact Student 
Safety Awareness. 

The program began last fall 
after UCSD received a two-year 
grant from the U .S. Deparnnent of 
Education. WahJig said UCSD is 
currently the only university in the 
country funded by such a grant. 
The current program \vill serve as 
an example for other schools inter-
ested in student safety programs. 

Wahlig said srudents should 
realize that the program is new and 
improvements will be made. 

"It's only a two-year grant, so 
the idea would be that we try this, 
get some good data, and share it 
with other campuses and see if it 
could be replicated and possibly 
write another proposal," Wahlig 
said. 

Other aspects of the campaign 
include men-<>nly workshops where

THURSDAY, APRIL 4,2002 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

SAN DIEGO INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL 

Around the world in 14 days 
UCSD hosts the annual international film festival from April 1 to 

April 14, celebrating filmmaking talent around the globe 

O aJolla is hardly the cen-ter of the cinematic world, yet for the next few weeks it will mas-querade as a global 
focal point when UCSD hosts the 
18th annual San Diego International 
Film Festival. The organizers of this 
year's film festival are intent on creat-
ing an event that goes beyond main-
stream cinema fare. This means 
affordable admission, plenty of enter-
tainment and an abundance of obscure 
yet innovative films from internation-
al talent. 

"I feel very strongly about showing 
pop entertainment films from foreign 
countries," said Beth Accomando, a 
member of the festivals organizing 
committee who also writes film 
reviews for KPBS. "Why should 
Hollywood have the corner on pop 
entertai nment?". 

[n addition, the film festival brings 
unknown cinema to many UCSD 
students, "[The festival) provides 
audiences with a chance to see a 
diverse array of films from around 
the world, some of which will never 
play again in San Diego," 
Accomando said. 

The film festival is a humble 
venue for the talented interna-
tional film community to share 
its creativity. Originally, the film 
festival took place in the La Jolla 
Modern Art Museum as the 
brainchild of creator Duncan 
Shepard, a UCSD alumni . 
Today the festival is run by a 
small group of individuals led 
by Ruth Baily of the 
University Events Office. 
The festival works from a 
budget of $20,000 to create a 
rewarding experience for 
audiences. The funds, put 
together from the entry 
fees of each participating 
filmmaker, contribute to 

the awards of the festival, which 
include Best Film, Best Short and an 
Audience Choice Award. 

This year's film festival began on 
Monday with the feisty premier of "The 
Cat's Meow," a film which revolves 
arowld the little-known yet intriguing 
murder mystery that took place aboard 
media mogul William Randal Hearst's 
yacht in the 1920s. The star-studded 
cast, which includes Kirsten Dunst 
("CrazylBeautifuJ') and Jeniffer lilly 
("Bride of Chucky"), sets a flashy tone 
for the upcoming screenings, relying on 
artistic quality more than star power. 

The two-week festival features 
movies from all over the world. Films 
from as far as libet and as close as 
Granada Hills will have an opportuni-
ty to grace the silver screen in coming 
nights. True to the style of the festival , 
the feature films are eclectic. This 
means that even fans of "American 
Pie" could find something to their lik-
ing. T his year's collection of fi lms will 
allow audience members to travel 
through the mind of a Dutch mental 
patient, enjoy the thrill of Thailand's 
pounding drums, and watch an Inuit 
run naked through the snow (on dif-
ferent nights, of course). 

Not all films shown at the festival 
will be of feature length. April 6 has 
been set aside as "a short night," 
which will spotlight a multitude of 
movies that are 30 minutes or less in 
length . Among the films screened will 
be "Speechless," which Danica 
McKellar wrote, starred in, produced 
and directed. While many will 
remember McKellar as Winnie on the 
popular '80s television show "The 
Wonder Years," she is now a fledgling 
moviemaker in her own right. 

"Talk about a labor of love," said 
McKellar about her extensive contri-
butions to "Speechless," her first foray 
into filmmaking. Regardless of her 
status as a beginner, McKellar is no 
stranger to the intricacies of show 

business. As a result, she will be giving 
a seminar in the Price Center Theater 
prior to the April 6 show. 

" I want to encourage filmmakers to 
not get caught up in the idea of break-
ing into the business. It's about creat-
ing your own business, it's about 
watching films and learning what 
makes films good," said McKell ar 
regarding what topics she plans to 
cover in her seminar. 

McKellar also has a small role in 
another short film, "Reality School," 
also showing on April 6. In light of lhe 
wave of reality television shows that 
are commandeering televi ion sta -
tions, "Reali ty School" is a mocu-
mentary about a school where Stu-
dents are trained in the art of behaving 
like "real people" according to rea lity 
show stereotypes. The film echoes the 
festival's intent to put a new spin on 
traditional entertainment. 

"Speechless" will not be lhe only 
film by a novice that will have a spOt in 
the shorr night. The shorr "That's 
That" directed by 17-year-old Aa run 
Sharp will also be shown. \\ 11ilc 
"That's That" is notewonhy for being 
the only black-and-white entry In th e 
festival, its style also deserves mention. 
[n the traditi on of old si lent movies, 
''That's That" has no dialogtlc hut 
instead relics on the actions of its 
characters and the tempo of the 
soundtrack to communicate with the 
audience. Sharp will be attending the 
festival on April 6 along with the films 
producers and its star, Spencer Sharp. 

In addition to the shortS, the Ii 1m 
festival has also attracted some note-
worthy feature-length films . Among 
these is "Design ," an independent film 
that also recently api eared at the 1002 
Sundance Film Festival and will pre-
miere at the festival. Critically 
acclaimed for its innovative editing 
techniques, "Design" is a dark look

'Van Wilder' director Walt Becker discusses modern filmmaking 
UCLA film school graduate muses about the future of cinema and the simple pleasures of making movies 
By JOSH ClOUSE 
Senior Staff Writer 

Walt Becker wasn't kidding himself when he made "National Lampoon's Van 
Walder." He wasn't expecting to 
have a slew of Oscar nominations 
or critics bestowing numerous stars 
upon his film. He just wanted 
something that would entertain 
people. 

"I just want the audience to 
know that they spent an hour-and-
a-half having fun and laughing," 
Becker said. "At the same time, I 
want them to also know that 
they've seen a movie that isn't 
devoid of heart." 

"Van Wilder" was the former 
UCLA Jl'aduate's second film, fol-

• II .. ~ • 

lowing "Buying the Cow." The 
current film, a teen comedy with 
memorable site gags, is one that 
Becker liked from the beginning. 

"The initial thing that drew me 
to the movie was that I loved the 
idea of a character that, first of all, 
didn't want to graduate, because I 
took five years myself," Becker 
said. "I related to it on that level. I 
also loved the idea of a guy that 
was kind of selfless and did a lot of 
things for everybody else. and 
then got into trouble and had the 
whole community rally around 
hi " m. 

Becker handpicked Ryan 
Reynolds, who he worked with on 
"Buying the Cow," to play the lead 
character. 

"I thought that if you give Ryan 

the title role in a movie and make it 
about him, then he would carry it 
through," Becker said. "I can't 
think of someone off of the top of 
my head that has his balance of 
looks, charm and comic ability. I 
think that he's going to be a big 
star. " 

Now that he's worked with 
Reynolds, Becker has dreams of 
working with some of 
Hollywood's more established 
actors. 

"I would love to work with 
Robert DeNiro in a comedy, 
because I think that he is just 
great," Becker said. "He is one of 
my favorite actors in anything, but 
especially now that he's in a come-
dy." 

Though the actors that he 

would like to work with are pri-
marily comedy stars, Becker does 
not want to limit himself to one 
genre. 

He said he would like to follow 
in the footsteps of one of his direc-
torial idols, Steven Spielberg. 

"He had such a great run of 
movies that were in a lot of differ-
ent genres, which I loved," Becker 
said. "That is_ something that I 
wanted to emulate." 

Becker would like to branch 
out, but is worried about being 
stereotyped. 

"It's so hard because now that 
I've done back-to-back comedies, 
they say, 'Oh, now you're a comedy 
director,''' he said. "The ne1(t movie 
that I want to do is either an action-
comedy or maybe even a drama." 

Deviation from comedy is not 
something new to Becker, who 
filmed a variety of different movies 
while at film school at the 
University of Southern California. 

When it is all said and done, 
Becker said that the best part of 
being a director is seei ng audience 
reaction to the final product. 

"The most fun is going to a the-
ater and watching the audience 
react," Becker said. "The biggest 
thrill is watching the audience yell 
and scream back at the screen . 
That is when you know that it is 
having an effect."

Elbow 
Asleep in the Back 

V2 

*** 
The band Elbow lives 

in a city rich with musical 
history. Mancheste r, 
England has been known 
for greats such as New 
Order and The Smi ths. 
However, Elbow does not 
reflect the a tti tudes or the 
sounds of the previous 
Brit-pop wave , whieh 
incl uded Oasis, The 
Verve and Blur, to name a 
few. 

Elbow, rather, follows 
the new generation of 
Bri t-pop artists who look 
at more somber melodies 
and lighter atmospherics. 

T heir debut album, 
"Asleep in the Back," fol-
lows the path set by 
Coldplay and Starsa il or. 
But mere is a darker tone 
to Elbow's style of music; 
mere are more dissonant 
chords and ava nt-ga rde 
noises that color meir 
runes a shade of morose 
blue. "Asleep in me Back" 
runs just over one hour and 
it makes it difficult to stay 
put for all of me slow-

• reviews 
tempo nll1es, hut the tracks 
are individually deep and 
moving. 

II Powder Blue" is sim-
pi y a gorgeous tune . 
There are sweeping 
trings but they avoid 

being trite by rcmaining 
subtle. The tune has 
beauti ful harmonies, 
mournful wail s In the 
background and a tear-
jerking chord progres-
ion. 

There aren't any tracks 
that wi ll rock your socks 
off, but me beauty of the 
sounds is tlu t it is sculpted 
with soft acoustic gu itars 
and mellow electronics . 
They al most fo llow a 
Radiohead model in some 
tunes by reducing their usc 
of guitars. Tracks such as 
"Presuming Ed (Rest 
Easy)" foc us more on key-
board work, di fferent pcr-
cussion instruments and 
cascading choruses. 

Elbow counts on the 
soft but strong vocals of 
Guy Garvey as it sweeps 
on top of the atmospheric 
sounds, and drummer 
Richard J upp fi nds the 
abi lity to make the drums 
sound like raindrops. 
Organist Craig Poner and 
bassist Pete Turner round 
Out me sbul -searching and 
melancholic tu nes of 
"Asleep in me Back. " 

Elbow will open for

complemented by the 
equal ly somber tune of 
"Too Rea l. " Thc steady

slightly dissonant har -

Spiritualized will proclaim their drug-
fueled music to 'Canes Bar & Grill 
Opening act, Black Rebel Motorcycle 
Club, will rock as hard ·as the headliner 
By JOSEPH LEE 
Hiatus Editor 

I he popular Briti sh-rock group Spirirualized erupted onto the music ,ccne with "Lazer GUIded ,\Ielodie~" in t 1e early I 990s. The melodies were indeed 
la~er sharp since vucaliM and guitarist Jason 
Pierce obsessively fine -tuned thc album. 
11 )'P llotic heats, I~sh s}1nphonic productions 
:lI1d tripped-out guitars characterized the 
Spirimalizedsollnd that garnered l11uch criti-
cal accbim and a devoted fan base. "Ladies 
and Gentlemen We are Floating in Space" 
and production marvel "Pure Phase" were 
other Spiritualized releases mat c:u-ved out 
their own niche in music. 

In 1997, Pierce fi red the res t uf his band 
and continued on to re lea c "Let it Come ' 
Down" in 200 I, which was the first 
Spiritualized snldio alhum since the I <}C)7. 

"Let it omc Down" was not a disa p-
pointmcnt for fans . Gospel choirs, epic sym-
phonic ,lrrangcments and drug-induced con-
tc 111 I lations make for anumer Spirimalized 
classic. "The Twelve Steps" is a lu h orches-
tral -driven tunc, while songs such as "The 
Straight and the Narrow" tea r along the rock 

highway at illegal speeds on illicit ubstances. 
Spiritualized is poised to challenge the 

world again with its substance-fueled mllsic 
and I 960s-insplred harmonies, which are fea-
tured un the upcoming- single, "Do it All Over 
Again ." Although mcy might not find ~oo 
much space at 'Canes Bar & Gri ll to accom-
modate a show that includes all of the orches-
tral sounds of Spiritual ized, Pierce has always 
been known to put on incredibly epic shows. 

Black Rebel Motorcycle Club will open

Updating the 'Red Curtain Trilogy' to 
DVD with much exhuberant fanfare 
By CHARLIE TRAN 
Hiatus Editor 

Whether gaudy or visually appealing, Baz Luhrmann's films have certainly found a way to spli t audi ences like no 
director has done before. While some see his 
works as visuall y and creati vely exciting, crit-
ics sec his fil ms as nothing more man over-
juiced, exce sivc MTV music videos mas-
queradi ng as ci nema. 

rrom his obsessive use of ultra-rapid 
montages to the almost decadent use of 
fl as hy. outrageous colors in sct design, 
Luhn nann's fi lms sta nds out likl;: nu other 
works. r lis three films, " tricdv Ballroom," 
"Wi ll iam Shakespeare's Romeo+J uliet" and 
"Moulin Rouge," are known as the Red 
Curtain l I-i logy. All three films merge pop 
cul ture with me clas ics, resulting in unique 
expressions of emotions. 

All three works have been recently 
released on DVD and have fully utilized tile 
late t technology to enhance the moviegoing 
experience. Luhrmann's work is at times baf-
flin g and mind-blowing; DVDs have now 
given audiences a ch:mce to go into the mind 
of thi s creative di rector. 

'Strictly Ballroom' 
T his charming, pl ain -spoken mdie from 

Australia was Luhnmmn 's fi rst experience in 
the di recting chair. On a shoestring budget, 
the filll1 doesn't provide any of me glitz and 
glamour of his later films, but that doesn't 
limit his use of ostentatious colors and make-
up, which make this film stand out. 

Scott (Paul Mercurio) is a professional 
ballroom dancer who doesn't play by the 
rul es; his he.1ft lies in flashy footsteps rather 
than the stated rules of dance. T his causcs his 
partner to abandon hi m. T hen along comes 
Fran (Tara Morice), an amateur dancer who 
Scott ignores partly due to her unattractive 
looks. The two slowly form a re lationship 
and soon Fran tra nsforms from an ugly cl uck-
ling to an attractive da nci ng partner. 

The video quality of the DVD is average, 
partia lly because the fil m was made without 
much money. The audio commentary 
demonstr.ltes Luhrmann's enthusi.lsm for his 
first work and therc arc many aoecdotes 
ahout the film . I lis directing development 
"i,ible In later films is clearly seen in the fi lm. 
/\ho included i~ a throwback Jocumentarv on 
ballroom dancing in Australia . . 

Although "Strictly Ballroom" i an early 
film. It sc t~ the tone for Lurhlllann's l.lter 
works. It provide~ a cairn and pleasantness 
that will appeal to most alllilence~ . 

'William Shakespeare's Romeo+Juliet' 
Luhrmann has experience 111 theater and 

he mcs that knowledge to adapt" Romeo and 

Juliet" to the screen. [n a daring, risk}' move, 
hakespeare's dia logue is kept, but every-

thing else - from me score to the setring, 
has been updated to a modern , high-energy 
viewpoint. 

T he "star-crossed" lovers Romeo and 
Juliet are played by Leonardo DiCaprio and 
Claire Danes. Almough me story is well -
known , me film goes into overdrive witll a 
nonstop barrage of sensory overload. From 
muking Mercutio a drag queen to staging the 
fa mous balcony scene in a swimming pool, 
the film takes a lot of creati ve ri sks at mod-
ernizing this classic story. 

T he audio commentary is also excellent, 
providing many details on how Luhrmann 
macle his deciSion on me maki ng of the fi lm. 
A lot is explai ned about the ada pta tion of 
Shakespeare's work Into a modern love 
tragedy. T here are design and ci nematogra-
phy ga ll eries that show sti lls of the produc-
tion concepts and ideas. Many of them are 
outl andish and show the crea tivity (or taste-
lessness) of me film crew. 

T he only major problem wim me DVD is 
the b ck of information and extras about the 
soundtrack. T he film 's songs were :1 major hi t 
wi th the public, but only two obscure music 
videos are provided. For those attracted to an 
outrageous update, the DVD is adequate for 
most tas tes, but for those aghas t by a dese-
cration of Shakespeare, this i a fi lm to avoid. 

'Moulin Rouge' 
The newest film by Luhrmann is onc tllat 

has deeply divided audiences. The movie 
brings back me long-lost musical with a sowld-
track drawn from modern-day pop artists sllch 
as Madot1l1a, Fathoy Slim, Nirvana ,md Elton 
John, even mough it's sct in the 18005. 

\.Vi dl an extravagant setting and design 
production, "Mouli n Rouge" is one of tllC 
most vi 'uall y oriented films ever created. 
O nly Luhrmann can so easily spli t viewers 
with not onl y a luscious ct, but al 0 with a 
musical alteration of beloved pop songs. 

Satine (Nicole Kid man) is the star per-
former at the .\10ulin Rouge, a "gentleman 's" 
nightclub in Paris. Christian (Ewan 
McGregor) is a young writer who falls for 
Sarine. The two fall in love, only to be sepa-
rated by a duke who is also in love witll 
Sarine .. 

The " loulin Rougc" DVD is one of the 
hc~t discs on the market til esc days, regard-
less of viewers' ta ste~ for the film . There are 
the usual audio commentary and deleted 
cene" but what set~ this DVD apart IS the 

quality ,lilt! dcpth of the extras. From multi -
ple angle shots of dance sequences to elabo-
rate discus ions on the set design, this two-
disc set prOVides vast II1formation on the filll1 
mat no film lover could ever re i~t, even if 
the film IS unappealing.

T he naked Inuil will be featured 

in the Canadian movie "Atanarjuat 
(Fast Runner)." Not only do the 
festival's participating filmmakers 
aim to expose their culture but also 
the nanlTal beauty of their home-

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

ters, makes "Atanarjuat" represen-
tative of the creative ta lent that this 

years festival aims to promote. 
As an added bonus, the organiz-

ers have created a midnight feature 
for April 5. The film is a popular 
Japanese movie. "Gamera 3;" a 
mythical fight between humans and 
monsters that closely parallels the 
natural disasters that Japan fre-
quently experiences. The organiz-

ers hope to attract on-campus resi-
dents with the midnight show. 

"Its a blast and it goes way 
beyond men in funny rubber suits," 
said Accomando about "Gamera 3." 

Accomando promises the festi -
val will bring "something fresh, 
something that you may not be able 
to predict, somethi ng that will just 
make you look up in awe at the 
screen." 

THURSDAY. APRIL 4. 2002 

During its two-week run. the

Puccini's classic opera 'Tosca' creates 
evening of tragedy, love and intrigue 
San Diego Opera's production combines 
excellent performances with beautiful sets 
By JENNIFER SPOSITO 
Senior Staff Writer 

Saturday night saw the opening of San Diego Opera's production of Giacomo Puccini's "Tosca," a much-loved 19th 
century tour de force. "Tosca" is a dramatic 
tale of lustful envy, political maneuvering and 
devotion to love - in other words, fully rel-
evant to a modern audience - and San 
Diego Operas production faithfully captures 
the spirit of its fanfare and spectacle. 

Rome in the time of the Napoleonic wars 
is a dangerous place, with allegiances divided 
between the monarchy and Napoleon's ever-
advancing armies. Puccini's oeuvre flings 
Floria Tosca, a diva of song and stage whose 
tempestuous countenance could put Mariah 
Carey to shame on some days, into the midst 
of the turmoil. She is involved with a notable 
painter, Mario Cavaradossi, who comes under 
the suspicion of the Roman police chief Baron 
Scarpia for hiding an escaped political prison-
er, Angelotti, a high-ranking official in the 
defunct Roman Republic. 

Scarpia's motives are not purely political, 
however; he harbors a lascivious lust for Tasca 
and a murderous hatred for Cavaradossi. 
When Cavaradossi is taken into custody, 
Tosca becomes entangled in the political fray 
of her day and discovers that love - whether 
one is its promoter or its object - can carry 
her to a drastic culmination of circumstances. 

0l1e of the most appealing features of 
"Tosca" productions is always the scenery. 
San Diego Opera's production does not dis-
appoint in this arena, and watching the {WO-
hour performance is a treat for the eyes as 
much as it is for the ears. The action begins 
in a chapel of the church of Sant'Andrea della 
Valle, sumptuously appointed in marble and 
gold, shadows and light. It comes to its heady 

climax atop the penitentiary of Castel 
Sant'Angelo, with an enormous stone angel 
looming over the action under a star· 
bedecked sky. The characters interact 
enough with their scenery to make it come 
alive - a matter of particular importance 
during Act II, when Tosca finds herself cor-
nered in Scarpia's quarters and must take cre-
ative liberties to defend herself from him. 

Russian soprano Galina Gorchakova's 
Tasca is a delight to imbibe; her voice is rich 
and expressive, conveying the diverse shaues of 
development as Tosca moves from capricious 
diva to heroine. Audiences have a love-hate 
relationship with Scarpia, who is sung heartily 
by KimmJulian in this production: Sometimes 
his wickedness appears so perfect that it's diffi-
cult not to like him in spi te of his malevolence. 

Richard Leech's heroic Cavaradossi, by 
contrast, is fully amicable. His soaring perfor-
mance surely did proud the past perfonners in 
the role. You may even have heard of one of 
them, a young gun who sung the role for an 
Diego Opera in 1967 - his name is Phicido 
Domingo, and he currently occupies a spot in 
a tripartite group of rather famous tenors. 

Puccini's libretto drags a bit at times, with 
characters dwelling on moments for pro-
longed periods, or exchanges lasting long 
enough to feel a bit uncomfortable and forced . 
However, San Diego Opera's ensemblt: carries 
the production beautihllly. Though it may test 
the patience of those used to watching 22-
minute si tcoms, this opera will not cea e to 
captivate San Diegans as it has done for thou-
sands of people for 102 years. 

"Tasca" will run on April 5, 7 and 10, with a mati-
nee performance on April 7. For more detailed 
information on tickets and other San Diego 
Opera productions, visit hrrp.//'MWI.sCopera.org.

Jason Mraz 
comes back 
for Club Ritmo 
By JOSEPH LEE 
Hiatus Editor 

III a deparmre from its usual dance and hip-hop artists, Club Ritmo is presenting Jason Mraz 
this Friday night. The acoustic-folk 
artist is familiar to the local coffee 
shop anu club scenes and was a 
crowd favorite at this year's 
WinterFest. 

This heartthrob draws inspira-
tion and influences from seemingly 
unlikely places. He said he enjoys 
instrumentalists such as the French 
electronic-ambient group AIR, 
which may be best known for creat-
ing the score in the film "Virgin 
Suicides." Mraz has also opened for 
the likes of Bob Dylan, Paula Cole 
and David Gray. 

With a diverse range of influ-
ences, a solid performance resume, 
a loyal following and beautiful 
music, Mraz will not fail to delight 
the crowds at Club Rinno. 

Jason Mraz will be performing at Club 
Ritmo at The Stage in Porter's Pub. 
Please look to the hiatus calendar on 
page 13 for ticket information. 

'The Usual 
Suspects' 
alTives on DVD 
By CHARUE RAN 
Hiatus Ed itor 

Sometimes 3 film's plot is per-fectly suited for the DVD for-mat. "The Usual Suspects," 
being a film that is complex and 
difficult to understand, is a good 
movie to have on DVD - because 
you can see all the subtleties that are 
so easily missed in the first viewing. 

When a group of five unrelated 
criminals is brought together during 
a criminal lineup, it sets up the chain 
of events that culminates into a risky 
drug operation. The criminals range 
!Tom a disabled man (Kevin Spacey) 
to a serious criminal who wants to 
leave the life of crime (Gabriel 
Bfne). The criminals are reluctant 
to get involved in the operation, but 
only commit to it when blackmailed 
by the mysterious Keyser Sou. 

The film unfolds through a series 
of flashbacks from Spacey's charac-
ter. Although the mO\-ie starts slow, 
it picks up very rapidly and keeps 
audiences guessing until the very 
end. Wrapped with a clever, twisting 
plot, "The Usual Suspects" is a 
thriller that doesn't resort to large 
explosions and dialogue cliches. 

The special-edition DVD greatly 
enhances the viewing experience of 
the film. Containing five fearurenes, 
there is a lot of information about 
the camaraderie of the cast and the 
clues that are given throughout the 
film. One highlight includes the 
infamous lineup scene where none of 
the actors could keep a straight face 
throughout fi lming. The director is 
upset, but evennl3l1y incorporates 
the gag scenes into the film. 

Also included are twO audio 
commentaries, deleted scenes and 
a gag reel that are truly hilarious. 

MGM released a standard cut of 
"The Usual Suspects" a while ago 
and if you're one of the unluck)' 
ones who already bought il, it's time 
to shell our another $20 for a supe-
rior DVD. When will Hollywood 
learn and make a DVD that is 'IS 
great as this one in the first place?

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

WHY RENT? BUY! 
HAs a 3rd year student at UCSD I wanted to Jive off campus and have a 
place that I could go home to and feel comfortable in . I gave Tobin a call 
after I saw his ad in the GUARDIAN and because I was familiar with him 
after living in the dorms. He not only helped me and my parents find a 
great place, he also cares about you, which is evident when he calls 
periodically to see how I am doing. He has been a tremendous help and I 
hope when I'm ready to buy property later in life I will have a real estate 
agent who has been as wonderful as Tobin! Calling Tobin is a no-brainer 
if you are looking (or a place to live. "

Golf wins first tournament 
Gale wins· Cal Lutheran tourney by 8 strokes 
ByANU KUMAR 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD men's golf team placed ninth 
in the UC Davis Aggie Invitational on April 
I and April 2 after coming off its first victory 
of the year at the California Lutheran 
Invitational on March 26. 

The Tritons edged the University of 
Redlands by one stoke and took first place in 
a field of 15 at the tournament. As a team, 
UCSD shot the lowest score in two of the 
three rounds of the tournament. 

Playing in unfavorable conditions at the 
La Purisima Golf Course in Lompoc, Calif., 
the Tritons opened with a combined score of 
317 in the first round, which put UCSD in a 
tie for the lead. 

After shooting 309 in the second round, 
the Tri tons were two strokes behind 
Redlands going into the second day of the 
tournament. Sophomore Galen Farris sank a 
15 -foot putt on the 18th hole in the final 
round to give UCSD another score of 309 
and a one-stroke victory. 

Claremont McKenna rounded out the top 
three positions, finishing with 957,22 strokes 
behind the Tritons. Mary Hardin-Baylor 
took fourth and California Lutheran 
University ended in fifth place with com-
bined scores of 961 and 970, respectively. 

Individually, junior Ryan Gale was the 
tournament leader and shot scores of 77, 71 
and 75 on the par-72 course. Gale was eight 
scores ahead of Redlands' Jordan Bailer, who 
finished second. 

"Gale has played some terrific golf," said 
UCSD golf coach Mike Wydra. "An eight-
shot victory is a great win at any level of play." 

The Tritons had two other golfers finish 
in the top 10. Sophomore Brian Duckworth 
took sixth place, shooting 78 in each of the 
three rounds for a combined score of 234. In 
addition to Duckworth, sophomore Greg 

Wilson finished in a tie for eighth place along 
with Joe Skovron of La Verne. Wilson and 
Skovron each had combined scores of 237. 

UCSD sophomore Andy Thomson finished 
27th, sophomore Blake Schneider took 44th 
and Farris ended in 51st. 

Windy conditions made the. La Purisima 
course difficult. During the players' prllctice 
round, wind blew at up to 40 mph, and it can· 
tinued to blow strongly during the two days of 
the tournament. 

The wind was the reason for an average 
individual score of 10-over-par 84 during the 
invitational, and the course yielded only two 
sub-par rounds over the two days. 

The Aggie Invitational was 3 different 
tory for UCSD, however. Playing at EI 

Macero Country Club, UC Davis' home 
course, host UC Davis took first place and fin -
ished far ahead of a large pack of golf teams. 
The Aggies shot the lowest score of each 
round, and Davis' combined score of 834 was 
29 strokes better than that of Cal State 
Stanislaus, which finished in second place. 

The Tritons finished in ninth place out of 
the 17 teams that participated. With solid open-
ing rounds by Gale and Duckworth, UCSD 
shot a 292 and stood in third position after the 
first round. However, fatigue set in after the 
early round on the first day of the tournament, 
and the Tritons finished shooting scores of 30 I 
and 307 to end with a total score of 900. 

Davis' Scon Gordon, Eric Restrepo anu 
Will Johnson took first, second and third 
respectively. Gale was two over par for the tour-
nament and finished 12th. while Duckworth 
ended in 29th after shooting 70, 77 and 77. 

Wydra remained upbeat about his te.am's 
chances in the upcoming championships . 

"We have been able to beat the teams that 
we have needed to beat this sea on," he said. 
"We need to beat more of the top teams in 
these last few tournaments. There are sever-
al teams that are very strong in the West."

Tritons hang perfect 10 in Hawaii 
Water polo finishes first in tournament over break 
By JEFF CHUNG 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD women's water polo 
team had an extraordinary showing 
at the Hawaii Rainbow Challenge 
this weekend. The Tritons now 
own a 15 -8 record heading into the 
final stretch of the 2002 season. 

However. the Tritons did not 
fare as well before the tournament 
when they struggled to a 2 -3 record. 
Prior to the Hawaii tournament, on 
March 10, they suffered a heart-
breaking 10-9 loss against Top 10-
ranked Long Beach State University 
in triple sudden-death overtime. 

"We had many opportunities, 
but the shots just didn't go in," said 
coach Larry Sanders. "It was quite 
frustrating, but the gjrls felt good 
about how competitive they were." 

The tough matches continued 
for the Tritons. The weekend 
before the Rainbow Challenge, the 
team ho.ted four matches inc:lud-
ing a meeting with defending 
champion UCLA at Canyonview 
Pool on March 16. Overwhelmed 
and a bit intimidated by the Bruins, 
UCSD quiclcJy fell behind and 
eventually lost 10- 1. Sanders felt as 
though his team didn't come out to 
play that game. 

"It was the first time this season 
that I thought [the team) did not 
play to their potential," he said. 

Senior Emma Kudritzki added, 
"To play against UCLA, you have 
to play without any fears , and we 
JUSt didn't have that mentality." 

After rebounding with consecu-
tive wins against Princeton 
University (9-5) and UC Irvine (6-
5), UCSD faced cross-town rival 
San Diego State University for the 
second time this season. While 
they were able to defeat the Aztecs 

5-4 earlier in the year, SDSU 
turned the tables on the Tritons 
and defeated them by the same 
score, leaving the team on a down 
note and a 11-8 record at that 
point. 

After finals weelc, the team trav-
eled to Honolulu three days prior 
to its first match in the Rainbow 
Challenge. Kudritzlci said this deci-
sion had a very positive effect on 
team's chemistry because the gjrls 
enjoyed their vacation together for 
a couple days before getting down 
to business. 

In their first game, the Tritons 
faced rival UC Davis. Led by 
sophomore Meris Bantilan-Srnith's 
two goals and a remarkable 13 saves 
by junior goalie Stephanie 
Lombardo, UCSD defeated the 
Aggies 6-4. 

Sanders was satisfied with this 
important victory over a tough 
team like Davis. 

"We were in control (or most of 
the game," he said. "I felt our 
defense was just superb." 

Following the victory, the 
Tritons once again played UC 
Irvine. This marked the third 
meeting of the two schools this sea-
son, with the result no different 
than the previous two. UCSD top-
pled the Anteaters 7-4 with seniors 
Courtney Hemmerly and Kudritzki 
leading the way, scoring two goals 
each. 

"It felt like all the pieces were 
falling together,» Kudritzlci said . 
"Everybody was playing so well." 

Building up momentum, the 
Tritons faced their toughest test of 
the weekend with a match against 
host Hawaii. A top I O-ranked team, 
the Rainbow Warriors gave UCSD 
all they could handle . But the 
Tritons were able to end the first 

period with a 3-2 lead. 
They never looked back. With a 

tough, swarming defense, UCSD 
shut out Hawaii for the remainder 
of the game while adding two more 
goals to their total for an impres-
sive 5-2 victory. Kudritzlci once 
again scored two goals and junior 
DanieUe Boyle added three assists. 

"Here's one of the best teams of 
the countty and we shut them out 
for three quarters," Sanders said. 
"This team showed that they could 
challenge any team in the top 10." 

Finishing out the weekend, 
UCSD faced Brown University, 
which proved to be no match for 
the Tritons. Junior Samara 
Silverman scored three goals in a 6-
2 romp over the Ivy League school. 

With the victory, the Tritons 
c:Iinched first place for the first time 
ever at the R:ainbow Challenge. 
Kudritzki was awarded Most 
Valuable Player for the tournament 
and Bantilan-Smith earned a spot 
on the All-Tournament team. 

With confidence riding high, 
the Tritons will finish the season on 
the road with the exception of a 
rubber match against San Diego 
State at Canyonview Pool . They 
will travel to the Bay Area this 
weekend to face San Jose State 
University, Santa C lara University, 
UC Santa Cruz and UC Davis. 

Sanders believes his team is 
playing its best when it needs to be. 

"This weekend showed that the 
team is really coming together and 
playing very well," he said. 
"Winning is team chemistty, and 
we have that." 

Kudritzki agreed, adding, "This 
team has a great opportunity to 
make it to the Final Four, and it 
would be a disappointment not to 
reach that goal."

Padres done rebuilding

Continued from page 20 
and while they lack starting 
experience, the potential and 
promise of this group of pitchers 
could lead to bigger things in 
years to come. 

The starting rotation begins 
the season with Kevin Jarvis , 
Brian Tollberg, Brian Lawrence, 
Bobby Jones and Brett Tomko. 

With promising youngster 
Adam Eaton out for the entire 
season due to reconstructive 
elbow surgery, the Pads will 
depend on this mix o( young 
arms and experienced veterans 
to guide them. 

Jarvis led the team last year 
with 12 wins and a 4.79 ERA, 
and has starred off well this year 
with Monday'S performance 
against the Arizona 
Diamondbacks. He scattered five 
hits over seven innings while giv-
ing up only two runs and striking 
out four in a 2 -0 loss to superstar 
Arizona pitcher Randy Johnson. 

Lawrence will be a huge key 
to the Padres' success. He post-
ed impressive stats last year as a 
starter, finishing the season with 
15 starts to earn him a 5-5 
record and a notable 3.45 ERA. 
Expectations are high for 
Lawrence to be a top-line starter 
for the Padres this year. 

Jones and Tornlco are both vet-
erans with playoff experience and 
have been consistent since the 
beginning of their careers. 

Tollberg has shown the poten-
tial to be a successful starting 
pitcher in the majors, but a finger 
injury slowed his progress last 
year. Even so, he finished the sea-
son with a 10-4 record and suffi-
cient 4.30 ERA. 

The bullpen has been

revamped with the addition of 
two relief pitchers in Steve Reed 
and Alan Embree. 

Reed split time in Cleveland 
and Atlanta last year and posted a 
solid 3.55 ERA while holding 
opponents to a measly .236 aver-
age. 

Embree had a shaky 200 I sea-
son bur is only two years removed 
from a career-eest 22 holds and 
3.35 ERA in 1999 and had an 
excellent spring training with a 
3.18 ERA in 1 I games. 

They add valuable depth to a 
bullpen that also fearures lefty 
Jose Nunez and former starter 
Jason Middlebrook. 

Closing duties are once again 
in the hands of one of the most \ 
dominating closers in baseball 
today: Trevor Hoffman. With 
his deadly change up, Hoffman 
converted 43 of 46 sav~ oppor-
tunities last year and has had at 
least 3 I saves per year over the 
last seven years. He is si mply the 
backbone of the Padres ' pi tching 
staff . 

Despite its 1-2 start to this 
season, the future is very 
promising for the Padres organi-
zation. 

The Padres have built a COI11-
petitive team on a limited pay-
roll and have an excellent chance 
to finish above .500 for the first 
time since '98. 

By running a minor-league 
system filled with top-level tal -
ent such as the pitching trio of 
Jake Peavy, Dennis Tankersley 
and Mark Phillips, in addition to " 
the new downtown ballpark sla t-
ed to open in 2004. the Padres 
are hoping to foll ow a structure 
similar to the Oakland Athletics 
as a strong small-market con-
tender for a World Series ring. 

Whether the Padres contend 
this season or not, the road to 
success is hopeful. Regardl ess, the 
2002 season should be quite 
exciting.

Questionable pitching offsets San Diego's offensive depth

After a remarkable 200 I season

pctitive edge 3ml talt:nt that most 
teams boast should portend an 
entertaining and exciting season 
ahead. T he Padres themse lves 
pos ess these qualities and have a 
cha nce of qualifying for the post-
eason. 

Possibly the strongest team in 
Southern California, the Padres 
enter the 2002 season with high 
hopes and moderate expectations 
Jftcr posting a 79-83 record la t 
year. 
. EI'en with Tony Gwynn's 
retirement and the tragic death of 
ou tfielder ,\like Darr, the youthful 
exuberance of the team a'nd solid 
core of players that general man-
ager Kevin Towers has assembled 
for this season looks to be manag-
er Bruce Bochy's stronge t lineup 
since the 1998 pennant-winning 
team. 

Leadi ng the offensive charge

Phil evin and right fielder Rya n 
Klesko. , evin is coming off a 
monstrous 41 home run , 126 RBI 
season while sporting a solid .309 
batting average. Meanwhile, 
Kbko will look to improve his 
200 I season, which had him hit-

ting 30 home runs and driving in a 
career-high 11 9 RBI s and cori ng 
105 runs. 

Left fielder Bubba Trammell 
also renlrns after posting career-
high numbers last year with 25 
homers and 92 RBIs, while Mark 
Kotsay will take center field once 
agai n after displaying impre sive 
defensive skills and adequate 
offensive production in 100 1. 

Former All-Star Ray Lankford 
will also vic for signitlcant playi ng 
time, showing the incredible depth 
the Pads have in the outfie ld . 
vVhen healthy, Lankford ca n pro-
duce 30 home runs and 90 RBIs in 
a sea on, making him a valuable 
player off the bench . 

Added into the mix this year is

man ean Burrough , already a 
popular choice for this year 's 
National League Rookie of the 
Year. First hi tt ing the national

Burroughs has produced solid

Collegiate Athletic Association 
regular-season title during spring 
break. 

The Tritons picked up their 
first loss of the season to Division 
I San Jose State University and 
won four other matches, including 
a decisive victory over Grand 
Canyon University last Friday. 

UCSD began the five-game 
stretch with consecutive 9-0 
sweeps of Division IU's Vasser 
University and Bowdoin College. 

Ashley O'Neil led the Tritons 
against the 38th-ranked Brewers 
March 13, first teaming with Mary 
Hung for an 8-0 win at No. 2 dou-
bles before winning 6-0, 6-1 at No. 
2 si ngles. In total, the Tritons lost 
only 30 games in the 15 sets played . 

Two days later, UCSD wel-
comed 15th-ranked Bowdoin. The 
Tritons lost only one set on their 
way to picking their 13th win of 
the season with Julie Westerman 
(6-0, 6- 1) and Hung (6-0, 6-2), 
each recording convincing victo-
ries in No. 6 and o. 4 ingles, 
respectively. 

After those two wins, the 
Tritons took a 12-day break for 
finals before heading to Irvine to 
take on San Jose State on March 
26. UCSD dropped the matchup 

4-3 for its first loss of the season. 
The Tri tons su ffered from 

weakness at the top of their lineup 
in the loss to the Spartans. In dou-
bles, UCSD dropped the top two 
matches, with Lyndsey Tadlock 
and Westerman losing 4-8 while 
O'Neil and Hung struggled to a 1-
8 loss. Kristina Jansen and Jasmin 
Dao combined for the only Triton 
victory with an 8-2 win. 

In singles, UCSD nearly pulled 
off the victory, but losses at the 
No. I, No.2 and No.3 positions 
proved too much to overcome. 
Jansen at No. 5 and Westerman at 
No. 6 pulled down straight-set vic-
tories while Hung won a 3-set 
thriller 3 -6, 6-1, 6-3. 

No. 2 O'Neil and No. 3 
Tadlock dropped their matches in 
straight sets while Dao lost the 
decisive No. I singles match in 
three sets, 2 -6, 6-1 , 4-6. The loss 
to San Jose State dropped the 
Tritons to 13 - Ion the season, 

Two days later, the Tritons 
remrned to San Diego to host 
Division IT1 Colby College. This 
meeting proved to be the easiest 
for the Tritons, who failed to drop 
a set to their 27th- ranked oppo-
nents. O 'Neil swept her 0.2 si n-
gles match 6-0, 6-0. jansen and 
Westerman dropped only one 
game while Tadlock lost only two. 

The most important matchup 
for the Tritons was saved for the 
last meeting of the break, a trip to

Grand Canyon University with 
the CCAA title on the line. 

The Tritons rose to the occasion 
and knocked off the 15th-ranked 
Antelopes 5-4 in UCSD's closest 
CCAA match of the season. The 
Tritons' depth was too much for 
GCU, with UCSD picking up wins 
at No. I and No. 3 doubles as well 
as No.4, No.5 and No.6 singles. 

No. I Tadlock and Westerman 
won 8-6, and No. 3 Dao and 
Jansen took their match 8-3. No.2 
Hung and O'Neil lost a tiebreaker 
9-8. 

Up 2-1, the Tritons headed 
into the singles matches needing 
to win only half of the matches, 
and win exactly half they did. 

Like earlier in the week against 
San Jose State, the bottom three 
players each won their matches 
with Hung's pivotal victory (3-6, 
7-6,7-5) in No.4 singles being the 
closest match of the day. No. I 
Dao and No. 3·Tadlock lost their 
matches in straight sets, and 0 ' 
Neil dropped a three-set match at 
No.2 singles. 

With the win, UCSD finished 
8-0 in the CCAA, winning the reg-
ular 'eason title in the school's sec-
ond year in the league. 

"Winning the regular season 
[is] great," said coach Liz 
LaPlante, "but it doesn 't mean 
anything if you don't \vin the tour-
nament [April 19-2 1 in Phoenix, 
Ariz.]." 

Both Jansen and Westerman 
finished the eason with perfect 
league records;ja nsen finished 7-0 
in CCAA singles play and 8-0 in 
doubles play, while Westerman 
compiled an 8-0 record in both 
singles and doubles. Overall, 
Jansen is the only undefeated 
Triton with a 15-0 record in si n-
gles and a 16-0 record in doubles, 
with 15 of those wins coming with 
Jasmin Dao at No. 3 doubles. 

The Tritons have struggled at 
the top all season long, posting a 
32-16 record in the top three sin-
gles spots. However, the bottom 
three si ngles spots have amassed a 
46-2 record and the doubles have 
gone 42-6. 

"Our depth is our strongest 
asset," LaPlante sa id . "We obvi-
ously would like to win more 
games up top." 

Now 15-1 , the Tritons are 
looking ahead to next weekend 's 
Xenia Anastasiadou Tournament 
in Pomona, Calif. The three-day 
tournament features No. 4 Barry 
University and No. 6 bilene 
Christian University (which beat 
UCSD in the CM tournament 
last year), as well as host Cal Poly 
Pomona, ranked 15th. 

"This is where we will evaluate 
where our team is and what we 
need to work on for the CCAA 
tournament and nationals," 
LaPlante said. "It will be the best 
competition we've faced all year."
