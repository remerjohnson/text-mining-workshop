By Imma Racist
A Real Mean One

UCSD admnistrators have report-edly invested up to $5.2 million in the creation of a mind-controlling 
gas which would help regulate campus cli-
mate, according to recently leaked internal 
documents.

Correspondence between Chancellor 
Marye Anne Fox and head chemists at 
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory 

reveal that the gas — which is said to be 
formed by fusing real pain particles with 
real tear particles (along with any light-col-
ored food, such as brie or macadamea nuts) 

By Stander
Foxy Laaady

In response to weeks of harsh 
criticism from members of the 
Black Student Union — who claim 
Chancellor Marye Anne Fox has long 
neglected her duty to recruit and 
retain more black students on campus 
— Fox finally emerged from her office 
last Monday to take a stand against 
her critics.

“I will not live in this state of mar-
ginalization any longer,” she said. “I 
shouldn’t be scared to leave the safety 
of my office every time I want to walk 
to the faculty club for some soups.”

Miraculously, Fox then ceased her 
trembling, and looked her adversaries 
straight in the eye.

“So bring it on, motherfuckers,” 
she said, shedding her characteristic 
warble for a deep, sure baritone.

Vice Chancellor of Student Life 
Penny Rue — wearing a pantsuit that 
read “Solidarity” across the breast — 

lingered back near the entrance to the 
Chancellor’s Complex throughout the 
one-woman protest.

“I, too, know what it’s like to be an 
anal-retentive anglo-saxon adminis-
trator, loathed and misunderstood by 
24,000 rambunctious youth,” Rue said, 
empathizing with her boss. “It’s rough 
out here on Library Walk. I am truly 
heartsick for the chancellor.”

Fox said her feelings were deeply 
hurt last month when a member of the 
BSU told her not to “just stand there 
and look like [she was] dumb.”

“Doesn’t she know that’s just how I 
look?” Fox asked. 

The chancellor then attempted to 
pass around a petition to shut down 
the BSU, but it appeared no one would 
accept the clipboard.

“You need to check your privelege 
at the door, Chancellor,” shouted one 
student from within the small crowd 
that had gathered.

“You will definitely be seeing a 
zinger of a campuswide e-mail with-
in the next few days containing my 
retort,” Fox said. “And when you read 
it, I can assure you, you’ll wish you had 
bought some calemine for that burn.”

“Shut it down!” she responds 
to the Black Student Union. 
“And by ‘it’ I mean your fuck-
ing mouth. Yeah, you. Bitch.”

By Mahmoud Ahmadinejad
Editor in Chief

Protests erupted Tuesday after A.S. Concerts and Events announced its plans to book the notoriously Jewish 
Matisyahu for the Sun God Festival.

Isaac Goldsteinman, head of Tritons for 
Israel, said he was outraged at the outrage 
expressed by some members of the UCSD com-
munity. He has kvetched that they be expelled.

“Matisyahu is an ambassador of rap, and 
he should be respected as such,” Goldsteinman 
said. “He represents a very prominent nose — I 
mean class — of Jew. Did you know Barack 
Obama is Jewish? True story.”

Protester and Revelle College sophomore 
Khalid Hasan, however, denied the holicaustical 
accusations. He said he and his peers are only 
protesting the artist’s inability to rap.

“Come on, my brother,” Hasan said. 
“Matisyahu totally blows. Have you heard his 

Jamaican accent? I’m pretty sure he only puts 
it on to make his crappy lyrics unintelligable,” 
Hasan said. “Jew be trippin’ balls if Jew thinks 
this is political.”

When asked to comment on the protests, 
Matisyahu stroked his beard thoughtfully for a 
few moments before expressing solidarity with 
his fellow Chosen People.

“I’ll stand on my own two feet/ Won’t be 
brought down on one knee,” he said. “I’ll fight 
with all my might and get these demons to flee.”See KKK��page D5

D2 THE DISREGUARDIAN� THURSDAY, APRIL 1, 2010� NOOSE

through a thermodynamic process — 
will enter testing stages on campus by 
the end of the 2009-10 academic year.

While e-mail records reveal Fox first 
contacted leading Livermore chemist 
Donny McChemicals to create the gas 
in September, it wasn’t until the Black 
Student Union began protesting on 
Library Walk that he believed the proj-
ect could be feasible.

“We are thrilled to hear about the 
‘Compton Cookout,’” McChemicals 
said in what was supposed to be a pri-
vate letter to his mother. “This might 
actually be our chance!”

Though scientists had developed a 
feasible formula for what they’ve copy-
righted as Klimate Kontrol Khemicals 
in January, they were unable to gather 
a sufficient measurement of real pain 
and tears to affect an entire college stu-
dent body — that is, until BSU protests 
against racial slurs began mid-February, 
and supplies skyrocketed.

“It was very fortunate that we were 
able to harvest such a giant supply of 
the ingredients used to produce KKK,” 
McChemicals said in an e-mail to Fox. 
“On average, we harvest four to five gal-
lons the week after the release of every 
Koala. During the protests, we collected 
4,000 to 5,000 gallons a day. It’s a very 
good time for science.”

After collecting sufficient materials 
for the project, a group of Livermore 
Chemists produced a small sample 
meant to be tested on student subjects 
in a preliminary trial-run. The team 
then asked UCSD administrators to 
choose one student they felt would most 
benefit from the treatment.

Though there is no hard evidence 
of their choice, A.S. Vice President of 
Finance and Resources Peter Benesch 
said he suspects the administration sent 
A.S. President Utsav Gupta for KKK 
testing at LLNL under the guise of a 
student leadership conference.

“Utsav doesn’t want to do anything 
fun anymore,” Benesch said. “We used 
to go to movies and play root-beer pong 
all the time, but now all he wants to do 
is write policies against hate-speech. I 
feel so lonely.”

Gupta declined to comment on the 
conference, but said he was “very happy 
to be part of such an accepting and 
diverse campus community.”

According to LLNL laboratory 
notes, scientists first attempted to blow 
the KKK up the rear end of the test sub-
ject. However, after finding the subject 
to have an abnormally loose asshole, 
they constructed a conspicuous, por-
table gassing chamber with which to 
dispense the chemical.

A detailed diagram included in the 

observations revealed the chamber was 
constructed to be easily adapted to func-
tion within classrooms and lecture halls. 
Preliminary dispatch reports show the 
locations for the first machines will like-
ly be those with the lowest Principles of 
Community ratings.

Though Fox has denied the exis-
tence of KKK, she said that the UCSD 
campus may see an unusual amount of 
fog over the next couple of weeks.

“We’re testing out our smoke-alarm 
systems for everyone’s safety,” Fox said. 
“So please don’t be alarmed if your 
classes are really hazy or smell like 
burnt light-colored foods within the 
next couple weeks — especially in areas 
with low PC ratings like Geisel Library 
and the Koala office.”

Additional correspondence between 
Livermore scientists and Chinese gov-
ernment officials suggests that if the fog 
is proven effective in regulating campus 
climate, it could eventually be used to 
control the climates of entire countries.

“Your people have shown exemplary 
levels of real pain, tears and white-
rice production,” McChemicals said 
to Chinese President Hu Jintao in an 
e-mail. “But you’ll probably need at 
least a 6.5 earthquake, in addition to 
especially discriminatory government 
crimes. But we’ll contact you if we find 
any sufficient chemical replacements.”

to the “toxic” campus climate. She said 
she was on her way to ethnic studies on 
Monday when she first heard the slurs.

“It was just this barage of all these 
racist and homophobic lyrics,” Pae said. 
“It turned out to be Jay-Z’s ‘Can I Get 
A...’. Do you know how many fucking 
times they say the N-word in that song?”

Her accusations were echoed by 
other concerned students, including 
Muir College sophomore Samantha 
Peterson, who reported hearing snippets 
of Lil Wayne talking through the tree, 
saying, “Girl I got that dope dick/ now 
come here and let me dope you.” 

Peterson said she was mortified. 
“First racism, and now this 

mysoginistic filth — this is a state of 
emergency,” Peterson said. “As both a 
recovering drug addict and an active sex 
addict, I find this very offensive. Does 
Mr. Wayne think women are just some 
kind of sex slaves, waiting to lap up his 
love juice? I don’t think so.”

Loft employee Jeremy Gallagher, 
who officially chooses the material 
broadcast by the Talking Tree, said the 
racially charged event was an accident. 

“One of my buddies put the tree on 
station 90.3, which plays a lot of main-
stream hip-hop music,” he said. “

A group of dissenting koala bears 
soon showed up to the protest, holding a 
tree-sit in the name of protecting the tree 
from the administrative axe.

Warren College junior and koala 
supporter Daniel Watts said the ter-
mination of the Talking Tree would 
not only be a restriction of its First 
Amendment rights, but would endanger 
all free expression at UCSD.”

“First Jay-Z, next Snoop Dogg and 
Kanye, and then what? Earth, Wind & 
Fire?” Watts asked. “It’s a slippery slope.”

KDST Manager Meredith Wong, 
who attended the tree-sit, agreed. She 
said she feared that if the Talking Tree 
was cut down, UCSD’s “fiercely inde-
pendent” radio station would be next. 

“KSD-what?” said the dude sitting 
next to Wong.

famed Dr. Suess character the Lorax 
also made a cameo at the tree-sit, mate-
rializing before protesters and allegedly 
relaying the sentiments of the tree.

“I am the Lorax, I speak for this tree/ 
It’s right to free speech, to play its Jay-Z!” 
he said. “And where will the koa-la-loots 
go, who live in the trees?/ Superfluous 
lawsuits are what nobody needs!”

The latest racially charged inci-
dent has inspired further investigation 
into other possible subliminal racism 
on campus. Sixth College sophomore 
Christopher Sweeten, who spoke at the 
tree-sit, said he discovered that another 
piece in the Stuart Art Collection — the 
giraffe catcher — forms a large, white 
“W” when viewed from a helicopter.

“It’s awfully suspicious, when one 
considers that W stands for White 
power,” Sweeten said. “We are in a state 
of campus emergency. Hear me when I 
say, it’s time to cut down the trees!”

DISREGUARDIAN
CONFETTI!

CUT OUT FOR
INSTANT

CELEBRATION.

NOOSE� THURSDAY, APRIL 1, 2010� THE DISREGUARDIAN D3 

By Robbie Williams
Copy Righter

Scientists at the biophysi-chemiengineering nanoscience department have teamed up to 
create a super-elastic performance-
enhancing bouncy glue for the men’s 
basketball team, an effort to push the 
Tritons to Division-I.

UCSD researcher Lithra 
Pratramianiamamlan explained that 
after scouring hours of footage from 
last year’s season, he and fellow sci-
entists made a startling discovery. 
“Suddenly it dawned on us,” said 
Pratramianiamamlan. “The team’s 
core inefficiencies seem to stem 
from unusually low levels of skill.”

According to the researcher, dras-
tic measures needed to be taken. He 
wanted to find a way to improve the 
team’s performance, while simulta-
neously teaching the players a valu-
able lesson in friendship.

“We rented every sports comedy 
we could find in the family section 
of Blockbuster,” he said.

At first, the Triton men’s basket-
ball team tried playing alongside a 
golden retriever. Former starting 
point guard Mathew Miller recalled 
the humiliation of being replaced by 
a quadruped.

“Buddy was a good boy, but he 
was never a team player,” Miller 
said. “Every time he got the ball, we 
would all have to pretend we didn’t 
want it before he would pass. I don’t 
think I had been more embarrassed 
since our scrimmage against the 
Globetrotters.”

Pratramianiamamlan and his 
colleagues went back to the drawing 
board. After 15 failed clinical trials, 
hope was all but lost, the scientist 
remembered.

“Morale was beginning to 
dwindle,” graduate student Daniel Yu 
said. “We tried everything: electrify-
ing a pair of Michael Jordan’s shoes, 
summoning angels from the outfield, 
turning the bench into a bobsledding 
team — nothing worked. We even 
recruited Amanda Bynes to dress up 
like a boy and play on the team.”

But just when the scientists were 
about to give up, Yu said they were 
delivered a small miracle of science. 
After injecting a hamster with a 
gene-enhancing super-soldier tonic, 
the team made an unexpected dis-
covery. 

“The hamster spontaneously 
liquefied, leaving behind a green, 
bouncy substance,” Yu said. “It was 
positively bursting with potential 
energy.”

Pratramianiamamlan said he has 
dubbed the substance “flying rub-

ber.” 
“We haven’t been able to come up 

with a catchy abbreviation yet, but 
we’ve got some friends at the litera-
ture department hot on that trail.”

The discovery has come as a 
relief to both the department and the 
men’s basketball team.

“More than 60 percent of our 
points come from cross-court dunks 
now!  It’s like something out of a 
John Wu film,” head couch John 
Linnmen said. “The team was just 
bumped up to D-I, and is scheduled 
to play a group of animated, under-
sized space aliens for the fate of the 
world next Friday.”

Pratramianiamamlan said he is 
proud to have found a solution to 
the basketball team’s problem outside 
the sports movie aisle.

“So far as we know, there isn’t 
anything like ‘flying rubber’ in a sin-
gle family sports movie, which is a 
great source of pride for the depart-
ment,” Yu said, beaming. “We’re all 
glad to finally have that monkey off 
our backs.”

Being the easy-going gal I am, it’s not too often I get upset about anything beyond the 
lack of pomegranate syrup on campus 
(seriously, Cafe V — WTF??), but 
this much I will say. And I will say it 
loud and proud. I am fed up to here 
(*here!*) with the way the BSU is 
handling itself in this whole ridicu-
lous excuse for a hot mess.  

Before you all start getting on my 
ass about how I’m just perpetuating 
ignorant white supremacy, I’m gonna 
tell you something only my best 
friend JJ and whoever dragged me to 

the Tigerheat bathroom last Saturday 
have ever accurately guessed — some-
thing that never fails to shock both 
the guys who give me a once-over in 
the locker room and the co-leads in 
all my high school musicals: I’m … 
gay. 

You’d never know it, really. I don’t 
shop at American Apparel, and I 
haven’t watched Oprah since she 
got fat again. But after the actions of 
the BSU fucked us all harder than a 
nine-incher through the backdoor last 
quarter, I’m ready to break my silence. 

Oh, don’t 
you play dumb 
with me, you 
little minx: I’m 
talking about 
the gay dance 
— or what 
was supposed 
to be the gay 
dance, before 
those people 
came along 
and started 
changing their 
Facebook pro-
file pics and 
crying about 
“pain” and a 
stupid piece of 

jump rope in the library. 
Yep. Someone thought it was a 

good idea, just because a few widdle 
whiney bitches couldn’t take the fact 
they’re only 13 percent of the cam-
pus, to cancel our cherished LGBT 
Non-Sexist dance (i.e., the only place 
on this shithole of a straight man’s 
campus to let the fucking sequins 
fly and find some decent D twice a 
quarter).

People say it would’ve been “inap-
propriate” to have fun when there was 
a protest next to Perks — that there 
couldn’t be a worse time to celebrate 
than when other people are like, sad. 
(Of course, I beg to differ: What better 
time for an impromptu UTC shopping 
sesh than when your hippie-ass TA 
cancels section to wave a picket sign?) 
But just ’cause a few peeps got caught 
up in some drama doesn’t mean we’re 
any less entitled to work our magic at 
Porter’s twice a quarter.  

I think it’s time the Black Straight 
Union or whatever woke up, smelled 
the coffee and realized that — hell-
o! — they’re not the only ones losing 
out here! We are the real victims of 
hate. Until everyone starts to lighten 
the dumb up and see us for the spar-
kling emblems — beacons, really 
— of fabulousness that we are in this 
god-awful bubble of sweatpant medi-
ocrity, this bitch is gonna be fired 
up — ‘cause if there’s one thing I can’t 
take no more, it’s goddamn Gance 
deprivation.  

I njustice. It’s a word. A word that means horrible things. Things like murder. Things like 
child labor. Things like the system-
atic enslavement of an indigenous 
race, the rapid destruction of our 
planet’s rainforests — things like 
mass genocide and assisted suicide. 
Injustice cuts like a knife. Injustice 
burns like a flame.

No injustice, however, is so great 
as that which currently faces the 
opressed students of the University 
of California. No murder, no tor-
ture, no baby-gutting gunshot to the 
soul of humanity can compare to 
the injustice now bearing down on 
the defenseless young people of this 
university: the student fee. 

Late last year, the UC Board 
of Regents — arguably the most 
racist, scheming, perverted group 
of asshole bigot shitheads ever to 
slither from the diseased rectum of 
an undead Nazi — came together at 
some shmancy whites-only country 
club for their annual supremicist 
rally. After nine and a half drug-
fueled hours of clubbing Native-

American infants (for chuckles) and 
getting down with the craziest, most 
fucked up old-people sex you’ve 
ever seen (for vitality), the geezer 
freaks had finally decided on a 
series of proposals. 

And you know what those fat, 
greedy fuckers up and did? They 
raised our fees. They raised them 
through the fucking roof, and then 
sat around laughing about it. They 
laughed and laughed until they 
vomited up their imported caviar, 
and then they laughed some more. 
Those sister-molesting asstards. 
Those rat-bastard vultures. Those 
bald-headed shitstains on the dove-
white robe of education.

Year after year, just like this, they 
rape us for all we are worth. They 
suck our humanity. They degrade 
our society, our lives  — heck, our 
very existence. They set us back 
hundreds of years, murdering our 
parents, euthanizing our kittens and 
leaving us sobbing to pick up the 
desolate remains of a once-great 
university. 

This injustice must end. So Here 

is our resolution solution: We con-
demn fees. We condemn the living 
hell out of them. Why, you ask? 
Because of this: Fuck that shit. All 
of it. Fees suck. They don’t help us 
at all. When was the last time fees 

did anything 
good for any-
one? Never. Not 
even once. God, 
they suck so 
much.

This is our 
university. Not 
the regents’ 
university. 
They don’t even 
go here. In 
fact, accord-
ing to a recent 
investigation, 

not a single member of the Board 
of Regents is a student at the 
University of California, and almost 
every single one can be traced back 
in family lineage to Hitler. No one 
sucks more than Hitler. The Regents 
don’t give a damn about us. All 
they care about is their expensive 

German sex toys and their fancy 
imported cocaine and their trillion-
dollar paychecks. Damn them all. 
Damn them all to the seventh story 
of Geisel.

Now is the time. We must rise 
up and take back what is rightfully 
ours. We must ignite the revolution 
and demand our retribution. We 
must shed the shackles of oppres-
sion, break the chains of brutality, 
spit out the gag ball of torment 
and crack the whip of action upon 
the hairy ass of injustice. We must 
condemn. And we must do it all 
with the most condemning picket 
signs in the history of condemna-
tion. Ones with glitter and stencils 
and clever-ass puns. Puns that really 
make those earthworms think, you 
know? Fascist bitches the universe 
over won’t know what hit them. 

This is it, motherfuckers! Let’s 
get pumped! Let’s get pissed! 
Let’s drop out of this piece of shit 
school! Let’s burn it! Burn it the 
fuck down! BURN THEM ALL 
AND MAKE THEM WATCH!!! 
AAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!

%\�0DUMRULH�6PLWK
Founder, Dendrophiliacs 4 a Greener Campus

There’s only one way to describe 
communication amongst students, 
faculty and staff regarding campus-
wide sustainability efforts here at 
UCSD: abysmal. Due to this unfor-
tunate and dangerous state of affairs, 
I’d like to use the Guardian — which 
has, in the past, ignorantly skewed 
the words and intentions of our own 
ambassadors — to maximize the 
public’s knowledge on how the UCSD 
Sustainability Collective is graciously 
accepting the responsibility of World 
Protector to shield future generations 
from a slow, sizzling death of ozone-
deficient trash asphyxiation.

Within our Sustainability 
Resource Center’s biodegradable, 
recyclable and edible walls lies the 
secret to sustainability: our students’ 
minds. Collaboration, dedication, 

determination, communication, 
action, deliberation, concentration, 
consideration and a green mindset 
within our student body directly facil-
itate in protecting our human species 
from extinction in this abused pile of 
garbage we call Earth.

The SRC coordinators, student 
representatives and janitors have put 
their heads together recently to gener-
ate even better solutions — trumping 
the establishment of the SRC itself — 
to keep the world afloat, and you can 
be a part of it.

Alongside our dining halls’ trash, 
recycling and compost bins will be 
the fourth and most recent install-
ment of waste compartments: the 
vomit bucket. Illuminated beneath 
our campus’ very own sustainable 
sulfur lights with glow-in-the-dark 
labeling print, our vomit buckets 
will allow students to spew directly 
into them during their inevitable, 

nightly college-kid romps, filling their 
contents with recyclable waste that 
will later be processed in the new 
Sustainability Material Conversion 
'BDUPSZ�	PQFO�'BMM�2VBSUFS������JO�
Eleanor Roosevelt College) to ulti-
mately be reused as biodegradable 
condoms, promoting contraceptive 
practices to control our planet’s over-
population.

The SMCF will be modeled after 
the SRC, using even more innovative, 
bio-friendly building materials such 
as sand, ice, chocolate fudge and used 
Scantrons as its walls, windows, roof 
and curtains, respectively. If passed 
UIJT�4QSJOH�2VBSUFS
�UIF�4.$'�'FF�
Referendum will allow all students 
to take an active role in funding this 
exciting new development at UCSD. 

Finally, our long-term project set 
GPS�'BMM�2VBSUFS������JOWPMWFT�UIF�
creative minds of our Sustainability 
Collective John Muir College student 

interns. Using a collection of special-
ized vacuum cleaners made of gin-
gerbread, our interns will accumulate 
discarded rubber bands, paperclips, 
staples, crumbs, hairs, used tissues 
and other miscellaneous debris from 
the floors of Geisel Library to weave 
a massive landyard which will, by 
the aforementioned date, hold every 
key necessary to open and close the 
UCSD campus.

In conclusion, it is only with par-
ticipation, motivation, inspiration and 
perspiration that we will be able to 
terminate this parasitic relationship 
we have with our planet and instead, 
treat it tenderly as our sensitive, 
bountiful host. How we live impacts 
how long we are able to live, so with 
this in mind, we can choose today to 
permanently modify our habits to fall 
in line with those of the Sustainability 
Collective — making our grass green-
er, one blade at a time.

would cost too much, so what’s more 
cost efficient than players wearing 
nothing out on the field?”

The creation of the team was 
made possible by a sponsorship from 
Victoria’s Secret, who paid $30 million 
to be the official sponsor of the UCSD 
Tritonettes. With corporate fund-
ing guaranteed, the UCSD Athletics 
department moved forward with its 
official approval of the team. The main 
obstacle for the team’s implementation 
was Title IX, which stipulates that all 
collegiate sports programs must have 
equal numbers of male and female 
student athletes.

UCSD Athletic Director Earl 
Edwards explained his department’s 
handling of Title IX.

“We immediately saw the sig-
nificance and importance of creating 
this team, so we were pretty deter-
mined to make it work,” Edwards 
said. “Bringing on another 20 female 
student athletes meant that we would 
have to eliminate an equal number 
of male athletes, and our men’s water 
polo team had really been disappoint-
ing us the past few years so we cut 
their program.”

The first round of open tryouts for 
the UCSD lingerie football team will 
be held on May 5 on RIMAC field.

Dear Editor,
In you last issue I saw that you 

printed [a neutral Guardian article 
on an issue someone cares about 
way too much]. However, when 
you printed the issue you failed to 
mention [irrelevant hearsay]. 

When you reported [simple, 
neutral fact] I feel like you missed 
key elements. You failed to men-
tion how [miscellaneous informa-
tion that we already heard but 
disregarded as hearsay]. I agree 

that [vague statement that shows 
misunderstanding of article], but 
this is about [one-sided perspec-
tive here].  

Also, I would like to point 
out other inconsistencies in your 
article such as the remark you 
made about [correct information]. 
This is a compeltely false claim, 
and in reality what happened was 
[completely incorrect information 
that tempts Guardian editors to 
retaliate and make letter-writer 
look stupid]. If I was writing for a 
newspaper I would do the job way 
better and never make such ridicu-
lous claims. 

[Conspiracy theory paragraph.

I think the claim you made 
about [objective, multi-perspective 
article’s background information] 
was incorrect because you failed 
to mention [biased, sort of racist

As [useless student leadership 
position that involves sign-mak-

Ricky Martin likes men, and I like 6’2” blondes with cock for miles — 
so what? Nobody gives a fuck. 

If Ricky Martin can get 
attention for coming out, I 
should be getting attention 
for enjoying dick-to-mouth. I 
mean really, who really cares 
that Ricky Martin “King of 
open-fronted-shirts-tight-
leather-jeans-and-perfectly-
trimmed-eyebrows” is gay? 
He’s almost 40 anyway. The 
only ass he’ll be able to get is 
from some wide-eyed 14 year 
old that wants a brush with 
sex-tape fame.

What the fuck is so special 
about an old gay-Latin-singer, 
anyway? Nothing. Nothing 
at all.  I deserve attention 
too. I do.  I mean, I’ve done 
a lot in my life. Just because 
I’m not gay doesn’t mean I 
don’t deserve some limelight. 
Maybe if I were gay people 
would care more. Actually — 
hey, that’s not a bad fucking 
idea. When I make out with 
girls people notice. 

Hot lesbians.  Drool over 
it, boys — I’m batting for the 
other team now.

Desperately

When I heard that my Ricky had “come out” as a homosexual, I 
couldn’t believe any media outlet as reputa-
ble as TMZ.com would print something so 
fallacious. Just to clarify for all those celeb-
gossip-whores out there: Ricky Martin is 
not gay. 

Just because a man can dress himself 
and looks damn good shaking his bon bon 
in a soaking-wet pair of white jeans does 
not mean he’s gay. 

Take Anderson Cooper. Allegations 
that that silver fox is also gay are equally 
offensive to my deepest sexual fanta-
sies. If Anderson is going to be plowing 
anyone — it’s not going to be some little 
Republican fag in a scummy airport bath-
room — it’s gonna be me. In fact, I’ve got 
a feeling he’s gonna write me back any 
day now — especially since I sent him my 
leopard-print panties (his fave) in my last 
care package. 

Anyway, back to my Ricky. Tight pants 
and manicured eyebrows don’t make him 
gay — they make him a man, and a down-
right sexy one at that. Labelling Ricky 
Martin gay will set a dangerous precedent 
for all well dressed men out there — Ryan 
Seacrest, you better watch yourself.

So, to all you scrawny little queers out 
there that want a firm piece of Latin ass: 
Get a move on. Ricky’s gonna be too busy 
showin’ me la vida loca to notice your 
pansy-ass moves.

pillowcase belonging to my great-
grandmother (the kindly Katherine 
Kay Kettleman) slipped onto the 
concrete.

That’s when we got another 
good idea: We could turn our 
sleepover into a costume party! 
My friend said I should be a ghost, 
because the pillowcase fit nicely 
over my head. I marveled as my 
BFF fashioned two eyeholes in 
the pillowcase. Since I was feeling 
a little silly by that point, I didn’t 

remember how spooky ghosts 
could be.

We decided that since we were 
celebrating Geisel’s special day, he 
would want to be part of the fun, 
too. After we put the pillowcase 
on the statue, we stepped back 
to admire our hard work. It was 
so freaky! We nearly skiddadled. 
(Instead, we put flashlights under 
our chins and touched ourselves to 
Twilight until we fell asleep.)

That was Tuesday night. I found 
out about the campuswide scare 

two days later, and knew imme-
diately what I had to do. I felt so 
ashamed to be associated with 
such a scary costume. I myself am 
scared of ghosts, so I understood 
the pain those people were going 
through.

As a student who has watched 
“The Others” and “The Haunting,” 
I sympathize with students who 
were mad that a statue had come 
back from the dead. Making fun of 
the undead is not funny. It is just 
plain spooky.

athlete dreams to be a part of.” 
The Tritons, buoyed on by the larg-

est showing of Blue and Gold solidar-
ity seen on the UCSD campus since 
its inception, took on the Matadors 
in front of one mildly amused fan, 
amounting to the greatest aggregate 
weight advantage UCSD support has 
seen over any visiting fan base in 
RIMAC Arena history.

UCSD’s solitary fan on the night, 
54-year old self-proclaimed hot-dog 
enthusiast Frank “The Blob” Blobsac 
said: “I like the way the dogs feel in 
my mouth.”

Blobsac says his affinity for UCSD 
sports stems from a deep seeded 
appreciation for the hot dogs sold at 
RIMAC Arena’s concession stand, as 
much as it is rooted in an appreciation 
for the teams’ athletic ability.

“The relationship that I have with 
UCSD volleyball is two-fold, and is 
therefore central to my livelihood.” 
Blobsac said. “On one hand, the sau-
sages have the most genuine texture 
on my tongue, unlike any concession 
stand hot dog in the area.”

Blobsac’s immersion into Triton 
volleyball fandom was not random, 
says Dr. Bosibich, Head of the UCSD 
Department of Spirit Promotion.

“Succulent hot dogs are delec-
table,” Bosibich said. “Fans love hot 
dogs, especially when the juice bursts 
onto their lips — much to their 
delight.” 

Blobsac interrupted, while shov-

ing three spicy dogs into his mouth.
“Their new sausage policy facili-

tates a greater appreciation for the 
athletes by offering an improved fan 
experience, centered around sau-
sage consumption,” Blobsac said. 
“Through greater adoration of our 
sausages will spawn a more profound 
appreciation for our athletes.”

Bosibich’s hope the concessions 
would draw fans was validated by 
Blobsac — who also expressed a 
multi-faceted appreciation for Triton 
volleyball.

“The way those strapping young 
men brandish their delicately formed 
forearms and their Spandex con-
strained muscularity evoke a visceral, 
cathartic reaction that simply cannot 
be ignored,” Blobsac said.

Bosibich plans to attract a greater, 
loyal following within the surround-
ing community — converting fans 
in much the same fashion that that 
Blobsac was converted.

However, despite the landmark 
achievement in attendance at a UCSD 
sporting event, three visiting fans 
nearly accounted for an aggregate 
weight close to that amassed by 
Blobsac — proving the Triton atten-
dance advantage was in fact fragile.

In spite of the massive influx of 
fan-power, UCSD was unable to over-
come its fundamental and undeniable 
inferiority as an athletic enterprise. 
They lost in three straight sets to a 
dominant Matador team.

1,000-year-old hot vampire 
chick, while his token black 
best friend unites the racist 
underdog football team just 
in time to clench the title and 
local mall cop/tormented 

Iraq veteran next door saves 
the world from consumer-
trigggered apocalypse during 
a high-speed chase with alien 
zombies through the city, 
and, of course, everyone lives 
happily ever after. Typical. 

Though gospel narration 
by the predictably chosen 
Morgan Freeman adds a 
certain level of sophistica-
tion to the otherwise juvenile 
tribute to 1920s simplicity, 
Apaho slaps his egotistical 
actors in the face with lim-
ited onscreen time due to a 
20-minute Michael Jackson 
montage an hour into the 
drama. M. Night Shyamalan 
steals the show, however, as 
a lowly meter maid whose 
single haunting line will reso-

nate long after the end cred-
its: “I see stupid people.”

With 9/11 as the same-ole 
backdrop, one-dimensional 
characters that are little more 
than pretty faces, Michael 
Baysplosions, twins who 
swap identities, a neighborly 
MILF who sunbathes in the 
nude, an ex-convict who 
will dance his way out of the 
ghetto, Tim Burton-inspired 
psychedelic cinematography 
and token midget and Meryl 
Streep as a middle-aged 
beauty on the inside, this 
weekend will surely get the 
consumer-tween thumbs-
up and a thoughtful Roger 
Ebert nod. But honestly, what 
else can that man do at this 
point?

W hen your daugh-ter asks to listen to the latest 
album on the gramo-
phone, be forewarned: 
A sinister, mop-topped 
foursome will be haunt-
ing your study this 
evening. Loose-Legs 
Lennon and his cronies 
have returned to soil our 
British shores with Sgt. 
Pepper’s Lonely Hearts 
Club Band, and the very 
foundations of Christian 
civilization are at risk.

This time, the so-
called “Beatles” coun-
terfeit themselves as the 
equally fictional Sgt. 
Pepper and his band, 
beguiling the innocent 
listener through a simu-
lated concert. “Lucy in 

the Sky with Diamonds” 
so revels in their 
counter-culture that it 
unfolds through a ring-
ing guitar, throbbing 
and humming almost 
as if it were about to 
morph into the most 
dangerous and blasphe-
mous of instruments: 
the xylophone.

Of course, the blight-
ers offer more hosannas 
to the haze of opiates: 
The tender, harp-driven 
verses of “She’s Leaving 
Home” are seductive 
to the weak listener. 
Men of Britain, be not 
derailed, for your wives 
will be weak-kneed with 
the Fab Four’s sloppy, 
satanic sex hair.

Reject the album 

as you would a Red 
Chinaman, for both 
are asking for your 
daughter’s hand. No 
good can come of a 
band who cackles over 
the plight of bereft 
seniors, as the Beatles 
often do in the sinis-
ter and agist  “When 
I’m Sixty-Four.” Mark 
my words: Those who 
don’t act with a firm 
hand will live to see 
their very own grand-
children smoking the 
Mary Jane and listening 
to this filth. Confirm 
your children’s souls to 
Jesus before they join 
the Mohammedans in 
the fire.

M y World is the kind of album where you can sing the 
whole thing without 
even listening to it, 
because you’ve heard 
it so many times you 
just know it by heart. 
Sometimes it makes you 
feel that you are Justin 
Bieber. Or, even better, 
that you are inside Justin 
Bieber. Now that is what 
I call living.

The first song is 
“Baby,” which everyone 
loves and watches on 
YouTube. This makes 
me very angry because 
I don’t think they know 
Justin like I do.

He often visits my 
thoughts at night. When 
I’m lying in my bed, I 
look up at the stars flying 
around in the great-big 
universe like little fire-
flies, and I just drift off 
to the luscious squeals 
of “Eenie meenie miney 
mo lova” while I imagine 
how life will be when 
Justin and I are together.

This one time, in 
my dreams, we were all 
laughing and just goof-
ing off in a fun bowling 

alley. We did brown-per-
son dances and frolicked 
like young lesbians from 
one lane to the next. 
Even Drake was there. 
Justin dipped his sweet 
little fingers into the tight 
holes in his special JB 
bowling ball and lunged 
his ball forth until he had 
emptied his entire lane. It 
made me so proud.

The other songs 
on My World are even 
more special because 
Justin wrote them espe-
cially for me. (Though 
I secretly preferred the 
bathroom YouTube vid-
eos to this new album, 
because it was a lot 
more intimate, just me 
and Justin. We actually 
would make really fast 
friends. Justin likes video 
games, and I like video 
games; would talk about 
girls with good-smelling 
hair and maybe I could 
put some Ambien in his 
juicebox and give him 
noogies like he does 
with Luda. And when 
it comes time for his 
castrata ceremony, I’ll 
be there to clean up the 
aftermath.

After years of debate and back-
and-forth controversy, UCSD finally 
has its football team. While original 
pushes for an intercollegiate Triton 
football team focused on creating a 
men’s team, the recently approved 
initiative sponsored by the Associated 
Students and funded by the UCSD 
Athletic Department will create a 
much sexier alternative: a powderpuff 
lingerie football team.

The team, which is slated for its 
inaugural season in the fall of 2011, 
will be made exclusively of female stu-
dent athletes who possess the physical 
talents and attributes necessary to 
compete at the highest level of col-
legiate lingerie football. Adhering to 
the bylaws of the American Lingerie 
Football Association (ALFA), the 
UCSD team will follow the same 
rules of flag football and mandate the 
wearing of a wide arrange of blue and 
gold-themed pieces of lingerie.

AS President Utsav Gupta, who 
has been one of UCSD football’s 
greatest supporters, views the cre-
ation of the lingerie squad as a great 
step in building school spirit.

“When people think of college, 
they think of two things: football 
and hot girls,” Gupta said. “Up until 
this point UCSD has had neither, so 
the landmark creation of this lingerie 
football team will help put UCSD 
on the map. And with all of the 
budgetary crises that we are having, 
this team will be a spark to revenue 
creation through ticket sales, mer-
chandising and alumni donations. 
Plus, earlier critics claimed that foot-
ball equipment like pads and helmets

PROTESTING — The UCSD protesting 
team scored a major upset over national 
powerhouse UC Berkeley yesterday at the 
annual Haters Hating on Hate Protesting 
Classic on the Berkeley campus. Relatively 
unknown to the activist world, the upstart 
Tritons claimed a dominating 8-1 victory 
at the event.  

After orchestrating a series of impressive 
racial protest events four weeks ago, UCSD 
petitioned the NCAA for recognition as 
a collegiate squad to compete against the 
nation’s best activist universities.  With 
the national attention on the campus after 
the Compton Cookout, NCAA Director of 
Impotent Athletics Schwanz Fotze said he 
would give UCSD a chance.

With a newly minted  NCAA certifica-
tion and a successful racial protesting cam-
paign tucked in their trousers, the Tritons 
entered the contest believing they could use 
their beginners luck to make a good show-
ing at the tournament. The three-day con-
test featured nine events with members of 

elite protesting groups like PETA, NAACP 
and ACLU participating as the judging 
panel.  Teams were evaluated based on the 
effectiveness of their tactical approach to 
each event.  

“It’s really important to pace yourself,” 
the event’s director Dummes Huhn said.  
“You’re out there all day with a picket sign, 
and your arms get really really tired. You 
have to be mentally prepared for that.”

Led by Black Student Union members, 
the UCSD protesting team is also comprised 
of members from Calpirg and UCSD’s 
Coalition to Save Our Futures. The squad 
scrimmages anytime there’s an issue around 
campus, which happens every two to three 
years. When protesting isn’t in season, the 
team trains by running laps around the 
Chancellor’s Complex and throwing darts at 
University of California Mark Yudof ’s head. 
With sign-making and simple slogan cre-
ation workshops, the protesting team does 
its part to teach the ins and outs of the sport.

“We are a group of people who really have 
a passion for this,” sophomore Arschgeige 
Horst said.  “Protesting is an art form. It 
requires a simplification of facts so that you 
can recruit people who could care less and 
grab media attention.  It’s all about inciting 
an uproar when everyone is oblivious.” 

Those hoping to make the team next 
year practiced protesting by focusing on 
a mock issue: the “Banning Socks with 
Sandals” campaign : a brouhaha over the 

shenanigans of people trying to keep their 
toes warm in the winter because it’s the only 
damn pair of shoes they own.  

Horst, a BSU starlet, earned the Most 
Valuable Protestor honor at the event with 
stellar performances in the Best Staged 
Walk-Out event and Best Inspirational 
Speech event.

“When you really care about an issue 
it makes a big difference in your perfor-
mance,” she said.  “I really care about socks 
and sandals.  It’s just so disgusting.  I mean, 
just take your socks off.”

The Classic featured events like the Most 
Catchy Campaign Slogan, Best Tactical 
Takeover of Campus Administrator’s Office 
and Most Ridiculous Demands List. The 
Tritons claimed victories in all three follow-
ing the brilliant “Socks Suck” slogan.  

The Berkeley Bears earned their only 
victory in the Best Reactionary Action by 
the Public as the team incited violent raids 
throughout the Berkeley community to 
execute all socks-and-Birkenstock wearing 
fools on campus.  

Despite only congealing into a NCAA 
certified team four weeks ago, the protest-
ing team’s early success bodes well for the 
future.  

With tuition hikes, healthcare and 
underpaid workers’ issues on the horizon, it 
promises to be an opportunistic season for

To commence the countdown to this year’s Sun God Festival on May 14, A.S. Concerts & Events scattered 
bookmarks with the names of five art-
ists slated to appear on the main stage 
across campus earlier this week. Among the 
names leaked were Drake — who Associate 
Vice President of Concerts and Events Alex 
Bramwell confirmed as the event’s head-
liner — Michelle Branch, Thrice, Relient K 
and DJ Z-Trip.

The bookmarks, painted with artist por-
traits bearing the stylized Sun God stamp 
and a tip to check out http://www.sungodfes-
tival.ucsd.edu on April 5 for the full lineup, 
appeared early on the morning of March 
29, when members of ASCE placed them in 

areas such as Mandeville, Price 
Center and Library Walk. 

Last year, the festival’s line-
up was revealed over mega-
phone at the annual Battle of 
the Bands. 

“Traditionally, announcing 
the lineup at Battle of the Bands has been 
anti-climactic and awkward,” Bramwell 
said. “This year, we wanted to do some-
thing new and fun, so we did a soft release 
of some of the bigger acts. We wanted 
people to find the artists on their own — get 
people talking to their friends and building 
the buzz.”

The unusual nature of the release left 
some students unsure if the musicians were 
officially confirmed for the festival.

“I thought they were just rumors,” Muir 
College senior Rebecca Holland said. “I 
kept hearing about Michelle Branch and 
Drake and seeing people update their sta-
tuses on Facebook, but I didn’t know if they 
were actually coming.”

Other students thought the partial 
release of the lineup was a mistake made by 
A.S. Concerts & Events.

The cost of on-campus dorms and dining will 
likely increase beginning Fall Quarter 2010.

A proposed department budget, finalized by the 
on-campus Housing, Dining and Hospitality Services 
Board earlier this month, now awaits approval by Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs Penny Rue. The plan 
would increase dining plans by $98 a year for students 
in the residence halls, and $75 for those in on-campus 
apartments. 

Housing fees would increase by $279 a year for 
students living in single or double rooms in the 
residence halls, and $247 for those in triple rooms. In 
the apartments, single- and double-room occupants 
would see a $287 increase, and students in triple 
rooms would pay $237 more.

The committee, which passed the budget on March 
12, is comprised of nine students representing each of 
the six colleges, student staff, the Inter-Collegiate 
Residents Association and the A.S. Council, as well 
as six administrative representatives from HDS, the 
Financial Aid Office, and the Residential Life Office. 
Voting members passed the budget 10-1, with one 
member abstaining and A.S. Campuswide Senator 
Wafa Ben Hassine casting the sole dissenting vote.

Those in favor of the proposal said the increases 
are necessary to maintain current dining services and 
food prices.

“The [increased] fees are [needed] because of the 
input gap that has been going up in general,” ICRA 
representative Michael Lam said. “Food, utilities and 
other costs are going up — such as water for all of 
San Diego.”

According to Lam, if the cost of dining packages

An internal e-mail mistak-
enly leaked by the director of 
International House has received 
criticism from students who allege 

that the I-House administrators 
illegally use criteria such as race 
and citizenship in their admis-
sions process. 

On March 4, I-House Director 
Christi Gilhoi sent an e-mail to 
the entire I-House listserv with 
the subject line “Confidential — 
I-House Selection List.” The e-mail 
contained a spreadsheet with the 
personal information of 148 stu-
dents who had applied to I-House 
in Fall Quarter 2009, including 
columns for factors such as “citi-
zenship” and “cultural identity.” 

A followup e-mail from Gilhoi 
asked recipients to permanently 
delete the e-mail without reading 
its contents, but the information 
was quickly circulated. 

Elizabeth*, an Eleanor 
Roosevelt College junior who 
wished to remain anonymous, 
said the e-mail reveals a flawed 
admissions system in which citi-
zenship and ethnicity are deciding 
factors.

The soul of student life at UC San Diego

SUNNY-SIDE UP By Philip Rhie

remains the same, significant cuts 
in services will follow, including the 
possible shut down of  OceanView 
Terrace — which has the highest 
operational costs and the largest stu-
dent workforce of any dining hall at 
UCSD. In the event of OVT’s closure, 
adult staff would move to other on-
campus venues, but students would 
have to reapply to work at another 
dining hall. 

Eleanor Roosevelt College com-
mittee representative Daniella 
Shulman said the decision to endorse 
a fee increase came after much delib-
eration on the subject.

“I want to stress that the commit-
tee has been working for an entire 
quarter on this to make the budget,” 
Shulman said. “In comparison to 
every other UC, I believe San Diego 
has the lowest housing costs.”

UCSD has the third cheapest 
housing in the system, with UC 
Merced and UC Riverside being the 
most affordable with respect to on-
campus residence halls.

Director of Housing, Dining 
and Hospitality Services Mark 

Cunningham said an increase in 
mandatory dining dollars would 
help pay for the reopening of Sierra 
Summit, the John Muir College din-
ing hall currently undergoing reno-
vations. He added that bump in fees 
would not be accompanied by any 
increase in food prices, and that 
the current level of services would 
continue.

According to a 2010-11 budget 
released by the board, HDS is try-
ing to cover an expected decrease 
in total income of over $2,300,000, 
as well as an increase in expenses of 
over $1,120,000. Given that 33 per-
cent of undergraduates live in on-
campus housing, implementing this 
increase will raise at least $2,550,000 
to cover those costs. In addition 
to the funds generated by the pro-
posed dining dollar and housing 
fee increase, HDS will be enact-
ing minor cuts in general service 
expenses — such as groundskeeping, 
buses, conferences, and post-office 
services — and large cuts in service 
improvement and development.

At a hour and a half long public-
input period proceeding the board’s 

vote, students asked the committee 
to reject dining-dollar and housing 
fee increases, saying they were an 
unnecessary burden on freshmen 
and sophomores.

“Housing and Dining knows that 
students are unaware, and they keep 
on raising fees when they might not 
even be necessary and taking advan-
tage of a lack of concern,” Revelle 
College Resident Adviser Chiang Jui 
Young said. “[Students] might not 
care personally because their parents 
are paying their fees.”

Ben Hassine said she voted 
against the extra dining dollars due 
to her concern that students fees are 
already rising so steadily.

“It’s essentially going to make our 
school less acceptable than it already 
is,” Ben Hassine said. “We already 
have 35-percent tuition increases, 
and to keep raising prices is danger-
ous, especially to students.”

Campuswide Senator Desiree 
Prevo said she felt students on the 
committee were unaware of how 
increased fees would negatively 
affect students and campus acces-
sibility.

“Being someone that tries to get 
students to come here, especially 
from low-income backgrounds, it’s 
really hard to say, ‘Come here, but 
I’m not sure if you can afford it.’” 
Prevo said. “It puts me in a really 
difficult position.”

CORRECTION
The March 29 Web poll results 
incorrectly stated that 84 per-
cent of respondents know how 
to withdraw their fees from the 
A.S. Council. Only 16 percent are 
aware of the procedure.

At the first A.S. council meet-ing of Spring Quarter, coun-cilmembers had little to talk 
about, yet managed to drag out their 
discussion and debate for over four 
hours.

Warren Senator Alyssa Wing 
announced the lineup for next 
Friday’s Warren Live concert – Delta 
Spirit, Junior Boys and Pop Noir.

Chancellor 
Marye Anne Fox 
arrived to present 
key points from 
last week’s UC 
Board of Regents 
meeting at UC 
San Francisco. 

Fox updated councilmembers 
on the administration’s intent to 
define common goals and actions 
to improve the campus climate by 
enhancing diversity with admissions 
and retention.

Future plans include expand-
ing opportunities for students to 
participate in cross-cultural events, 
identifying appropriate areas of 
campus for art displays representa-
tive of minority communities and 
creating resource centers for African 
American students. 

Associate Vice President of 
Concerts & Events Alex Bramwell dis-
cussed how his department books art-
ists for the Sun God Festival each year. 

This year, the coveted festival 
wristbands will be distributed on 
both the Thursday before and the 
Friday of the festival. More details 
and the official line-up in its full 
glory will be revealed Monday, April 
5 on the festival Web site.

Revelle Senator Arvind 
Satyanarayan brought his senator 
project – a glossy banner with facts 
about Revelle – to the council meeting. 

The biggest talk of the night came 
when VP of Finance and Resources 

Peter Benesch gave an update on the 
state of the A.S. budget. 

Recently, the funding originally 
allocated for media organizations 
was spent. With new student media 
outlet — such as No. 15 Magazine 
— councilmembers debated over 
whether the money would come 
from Mandate Reserves, which is 
money typically saved for traditional 

or long-term larg-
er events or from 
money set aside 
for regular stu-
dent organization 
programming. 

“It isn’t about 
punishing new 

or old orgs, we’ve already overallo-
cated our whole budget by $100,000, 
which is OK, but we established our 
priorities in the beginning of the 
year and we should stick to that,” 
Benesch said.

After a good hour of debate, 
$8,693.48 was allocated for No. 15 
magazine from media orgs unal-
located. 

Members from the freshman 
council came to present their accom-
plishments from the last two quar-
ters, and said an emotional goodbye. 

Items from the finance commit-
tee and the campus affairs commit-
tee passed through council quickly 
and painlessly. 

AVP Enterprise Operations Rishi 
Ghosh proposed a resolution urg-
ing the listing of non-bookstore class 
materials on Tritonlink and other 
campus systems as a way to improve 
the academic experience for students. 

Talk later returned to the 
Mandate Reserve money during new 
business. Campuswide Senator Carli 
Thomas, said, “We’ve had a strong 
precedent of not passing mandate 
reserves. We relocate all this money 
— this happens every year.”

idiot accidentally left the flyers out-
side,” Marshall College senior Denice 
Praxidio said.

Plans for a similar viral campaign 
were discussed for the festival last year, 
but fell through due to design and 
printer delays. 

According to Bramwell, almost all 
the other acts performing at Sun God 
are booked. He said the April 5 release 
of the festival’s full lineup will include 
other details about the event, includ-
ing the layout of the event on RIMAC 
Field and the other three artists per-
forming on the main stage.

“Hopefully, if everything goes 
as planned, we’ll have some ban-
ners around campus [on Monday],” 
Bramwell said. “We’re going to have a 
Web site launch; the Sun God Web site 
will be completely updated, and we’ll 
have a Facebook event circulating.”

In the past, A.S. Concerts & Events 
switched off between hip-hop and rock 
headliners from year to year. The deci-
sion to book Drake as the headliner 
following the 2009 headlining perfor-
mance from hip-hop band N.E.R.D. 
represents a change in priorities for the 
2010 festival.

“We generally flip-flop between 
rock and hip-hop, although that is not 
necessarily how it always has been,” 
Bramwell said. “We didn’t feel like we 
should settle for a less popular rock 
act if a better hip-hop act was avail-
able. I think Drake’s a cool headliner. 
He’s at his peak right now as an up 
and coming artist. He’s more relevant 
than some of the previous headliners 
we’ve had.”

Praxidio was enthusiastic about 
the lineup.

Flops to the A.S. Council for promising the Grove Cafe would 
accept dining dollars when its health inspection grade was 

in fact too low for the dining department’s standards. 

Props to Bill O’Reilly for offering to pay $16,500 in legal 
fees for the father of a deceased marine, who sued the 
Westboro Baptist Church after it picketed his son’s funeral. “ The idea of Sun God isn’t to aim for danceable music.”ALEX BRAMWELLA.S. AVP CONCERTS & EVENTS

OUT OF CONTEXT

Sometime in late June of the year 2044, a thirty-one year old blogger named David Sullivan 
stares intently at a computer screen in 
a quiet corner of his damp basement 
apartment. 

He shifts slightly in his second-
hand IKEA armchair, grunting as he 
reaches for a torn bag of Cool Ranch 
Doritos. Digging aggressively into 
the greasy crumbs with one hand, he 
carefully scrolls through a collection 

of thumbnail photographs with the 
other, his eyes darting rapidly back 
and forth over chaotic images of an 
early twenty-first century college 
house party. In one shot a group of 
girls grope one another suggestively, 
each of them clutching a 40-ounce 
bottle of malt liquor. In another a 
crowd of red-faced students stand 
around a battered keg, watching 
eagerly as two young men chug deep-
ly from red plastic cups, racing each 
other at breakneck speed to the brink 
of black-out oblivion. 

Sullivan stops suddenly on a dimly 
lit image of chubby male student swig-
ging cheap vodka from a plastic bottle. 
The next shot is the same student, 
now in mid-fall, his glazed eyes wide 
with surprise, the bottle abandoned 
on the ground at his side. Two thumb-
nails later the chubby kid is back on 
his feet and grinding up against one 
of the malt liquor girls, his pale face 
frozen in drunken ecstasy. 

“Gotcha,” Sullivan whispers, 
glancing over at his television. The 
chubby kid, now thirty years older, 
stares back from a podium ringed 
with American flags, his arms wav-
ing aggressively as he delivers an 
impassioned speech about the fiscal 
woes of the middle-class auto worker. 
He is Thomas Miller, junior senator 
from California and the Independent 
nominee for president of the United 
States. Tomorrow, when Sullivan 
posts the damning photographs on 
his popular blog, Miller — who has 
billed himself as a squeaky clean 
political outsider — will face a media 
hellstorm. He will lose his nomina-
tion, drop out of the race and retire 
begrudgingly to the fleeting shadows 
of defamed anonymity. He will be 
temporarily ruined and permanently 
frowned upon. He will rue the day 
he let his roommate post those damn 
photos on Facebook.

Of course, that’s just a hypo-
thetical situation. The question is 
how soon it will be a reality. With the 
sheer amount of unfiltered informa-
tion that our young generation feeds 
so willingly to the vast social landfill 
of the Internet, it’s entirely conceiv-
able to imagine a day when every 
political candidate, every high-pow-
ered CEO, every teacher, parent and 
community leader is subject to the 
unforeseen embarrassment of some 
long-forgotten Facebook snapshot. 
Whether depicting casual drug use or 
the whiskey-driven exposure of one’s 
cleavage, many of our wildest college 
experiences are now etched perma-

Things have been pretty mellow around here this week.Maybe our minds are too 
fried from finals adderall abuse or 
spring break binge-drinks to remem-
ber anything. Maybe all this La Jolla 
sunshine is distracting us. Whatever 
the case, it’s safe to say most have 
forgotten the racial tension and free-
speech debates that plagued the cam-
pus last quarter.

That is, at least all those who 
didn’t notice the tension until their 
paths were blocked from Rubio’s to 
Center Hall by a deafening “Real 
pain, real action!” 

Now that Chancellor Marye Anne 
Fox has agreed to meet the Black 
Student Union’s list of demands and 
the local news channels have cleared 
Library Walk, efforts to create a more 
tolerant campus community have 
moved indoors. In particular, walkouts 

and picket signs have been replaced 
with an effort to pass statewide legisla-
tion that would ban hate speech.

A.S. Vice President External 
Affairs Gracelynne West and BSU co-
chairs David Ritcherson and Fnann 
Keflezighi are currently working with 
the UC Student Association to imple-
ment a law that would make slur-lov-
ing publications like the Koala illegal.

Downright unconstitutional, if you 
ask us. A lot of other people think so 
too. But that’s an issue that — if chal-
lenged in court — will soon be hashed 
out with lawyers. The real problem 
with California Law AB 412 is that, in 
attempting to protect those who are 
hurt by racist remarks, would end up 
regulating individual thought.

Of course, most would rather 
poke fun at such legislation than care 
about what’s behind it: a group of stu-
dents who feel ostracized when they 

hear their peers throwing around 
racial slurs with such causal callous-
ness. But even if an umbrella policy 
swooped in and forced every hurtful 
word out of public discussion, the 
ignorance would remain.

Any policy which forces tolerance 
would most likely polarize the com-
munity further. Just think how deter-
mined Koala members were to release 
a sufficiently offensive issue once A.S. 
President Utsav Gupta slapped their 
paws and froze their funding. When 
a group of students feels their right to 
free speech is being threatened, they 
will come out in full force — focusing 
on their right to say something rather 
than how it might affect someone liv-
ing a different experience.

That’s why we feel student leaders 
shouldn’t waste their time with broad 
legislation that trickles from the top 
down and gives even more power to 

administrators. Instead, they should 
focus on enlightening a student body 
that’s still got a lot to learn about 
the system. Along with pumping 
up outreach efforts and maintain-
ing retention programs for minority 
students, why not plan campuswide 
campaigns that invite students to 
learn more about where organizations 
like MEChA and the BSU are com-
ing from? Education cannot stop at 
a few impassioned rallies — we need 
to engage in an active dialogue about 
why hate speech is hurtful.

At the very least, the authors of the 
bill could focus on writing a strictly 
on-campus policy. They might not be 
able to eliminate hate speech or con-
vince a group of righteous bigots that 
their public charade is a detriment 
to our community, but they could at 
least push for localized penalization 
where possible.

The Sun God Festival may have earned itself an unofficial slo-gan this year: last name “ever,” 
first name “lamest.” 

We’re not referring solely to the 
just-leaked lineup — we’re talking 
about the new viral bookmark cam-
paign to “get people talking” about 
everyone’s favorite day of the year. But 
the event’s lackluster slips of expensive 
paper and weak musical lineup are 
not promising signs, to say the least.

Viral marketing, when done 
right, is effective — everyone gets 
borderline obsessive over finding the 
next clue in a mysterious grassroots 
campaign, and pretty soon you have 
a fan-base frenzy of Dark Knight pro-
portions. The whole point is to build 
anticipation, and to make us want to 

know more — which is exactly why 
dropping the headliners’ names with 
absolutely no lead-ing is one big fat 
letdown.

That’s not to say that A.S. Concerts 
& Events hasn’t succeeded in the 
game of pre-Sun God buzz in past 
years. Former A.S. Vice President of 
Concerts & Events Garrett Berg’s Baby 
Sun God search left cryptic clues on 
Twitter of where to look for the little 
guys, offering prizes to anybody who 
happened upon one while crossing 
the eucalyptus grove. Campaigns like 
that get you 500 followers and a cam-
pus full of students frantically check-
ing their cell phones for the next A.S. 
message. Imagine that. 

Dropping a few bookmarks on a 
bench, however, completely ignores 

the surefire rules 
of playing 
hard to get. 
There’s 
nothing 
to decode 
and no 
need to 
devote any 
thought to figuring 
out what’s going 
on aside from try-
ing to remember 
the lyrics to that other 
Drake song. 

In short: You really fucked 
this one up, ASCE. 

At least in the past the final 
announcement arrived with 
a little fanfare, over a loud-

speaker at the Battle of the Bands to 
a huge crowd. This time, says AVP of 
Concerts and Events Alex Bramwell, 

the news will just be added to the 
Sun God Web site.

Loud things through mega-
phones offer students an opportu-

nity to cheer. UCSD doesn’t get 
a whole lot of chances to lose its 
marbles, and the latest replace-
ment of one of those moments 

with an anti-climactic 
bookmark is a worry-
ing sign of the weeks 

to come.
At the very least, 

ASCE could have saved 
the headliner for the big

Dear Editor,
As the new quarter begins, we 

ask that all students, staff, faculty and 
especially administrators reflect on the 
events that shook UCSD at the end 
of February. We do so not in order to 
dredge up unpleasant memories but to 
focus the campus on the road ahead: 
one that hopefully will lead to a more 
inclusive campus that reflects all of 
California’s communities.

If you are among those who still 
are not aware that something impor-
tant happened in February, we urge 
you to ask your fellow students, work-
ers or colleagues for their understand-
ing of what took place. We have met 
some professors, for example, who 
truly knew nothing about the “cook-
out,” the noose, the other racist inci-
dents or even the rallies and protests. 
It would behoove them to look at the 
online video of the protests and listen 
to the students. It would be good for 
them to learn what is happening out-
side their office or lab.

If you are among those who heard 
about the incidents and responded 
with, “It doesn’t affect me so I don’t 
really care,” we ask that you look 
beyond your own career or studies. 
UCSD often seems to be in a pro-
tected bubble far away from the messy 
reality of history, but racism, anti-
immigrant sentiments and the dis-
mantling of public higher education 
are on the rise throughout the nation 
— and UCSD is not exempt. 

If you are among those who heard 
about the incidents and reacted by 
saying, “Yes, the incidents were offen-
sive, but the Black Student Union and 
its allies made too big a deal about it. 
They overreacted,” we ask that you 
take the time to think about why 
many of your fellow students reacted 

the way they did. We ask that you 
Google “noose” and scan images of 
lynching. We ask that you consider 
what it would be like to never see 
another person from your community 
in class. Perhaps then you will under-
stand that the reaction was not exag-
gerated, but in fact quite temperate.

More importantly, we ask all 
students, staff, faculty and especially 
administrators at UCSD to join in the 
long-term project to make the campus 
more reflective of California and more 
hospitable to all communities. We 
believe Chancellor Marye Anne Fox’s 
team when it says it is committed to 
making much needed systemic chang-
es in student and faculty demograph-
ics, the curriculum and the entire 
campus environment. With interna-
tional attention on UCSD, it is crucial 
that such changes be implemented 
before private donors and other fund-
ing sources begin to redirect their gifts 
to other more diverse schools.

The students who protested 
together with their staff and faculty 
allies were not thinking, “What can 
we get for ourselves?” but rather, 
“What can we do to make UCSD a 
better university for those who come 
after us?” We hope you will support 
them in their ongoing efforts.

Monday reveal. Giving us a reason 
to hold our breath is the basic rule of 
announcing anything — that’s why 
they always save first place for last.

Although every once in a while 
it’s nice to tap into our inner 12-year-
olds (I love you, Michelle), it’s hard 
to shake the feeling that Sun God 
2010 is going to be a drastically less 
awesome version of Sun God 2009, 
however uncaged the daytime festivi-
ties find themselves to be. 

We’ve got DJ Z-Trip serving as 
the Girl Talk emulator — and, like 
last year’s mashup god, his dance tent 
party might end up being the ulti-
mate draw for this year’s festivities. 
We have some reservations, though. 
Z-Trip may have rightfully earned 
concert cred for fathering the mash-

up movement, that doesn’t mean he’s 
the best around — Girl Talk is his 
more fluid and infinitely less stodgy 
grandson, and there are more just 
like him who have taken what Z-Trip 
started and run with it. Needless to 
say, this year’s dance tent may be 
lacking some essential groove.

Relient K and Thrice are essen-
tially identical as Christian-rock 
bands, albeit more rollicking ver-
sions of last year’s Augustana. Sara 
Bareilles and Michelle Branch go 
head to head for “cute female artist 
with fun pop vibe,” though the differ-
ence here is that Branch is going to 
capitalize on all the soft spots she hit 
with girls who still remember the lyr-
ics to “Everywhere” in middle school.

There’s one act, however, that’s 
got us worried; the one with the 

Top-40 hit who is, yes, “a really big 
name right now,” but doesn’t exactly 
have a whole lot to back it up: the 
one and only Drake. We’re having 
horrific flashbacks to Sun God 2008, 
when Sean Kingston flopped onstage 
and didn’t even finish the one song 
we came to see him sing. Peruse a 
couple of live Drake performances 
online and you’ll see he’s got a knack 
for shouting over the pretty part of 
the song, and then cutting it off like 
a real jerk. 

Still, there are three more unan-
nounced bands coming to the main 
stage, and Bramwell says there are 
still some decent-sized names he’s 
kept under wraps. 

Here’s to hoping that Monday’s 
announcement will awaken the so-far 
gloomy Sun God spirit in all of us.

10 THE UCSD GUARDIAN� THURSDAY, APRIL 1, 2010� NEWS

“I think the lineup is a big step 
up from last year,” she said. “I think 
this year really has something for 
everyone.”

Though the majority of the acts 
are booked by ASCE, the traditional 
Battle of the Bands —held April 3 at 
the Loft — will determine the main-
stage opener. 

Student bands registered online 
at the Sun God Web site, where other 
students could vote for their favor-
ites. Voting ended March 14 and now 
the top five bands — Mack’N Biz, 
Diversion Sound, Seriously, Zephyr 
Riot and Mad Traffic — will com-
pete.

Yet another musical face-off — 
the first ever DJ Battle Dance Party 
— will take place on April 2 at the 
Loft to determine which student dee-
jays will spin under the festival’s 
dance tent.

“Last year, we had a deal with 
DVC where we gave them blocks 
of time and they chose the DJs,” 
Bramwell said. “We still gave DVC 
blocks of time early in the afternoon, 
but we wanted to give the DJs that we 
felt were the best a spot.”

A panel of five judges consisting 
of A.S. Concerts & Events interns 
and staff members will decide both 
the Battle of the Bands and the DJ 
Battle Dance Party.

 “It’s a pretty good way for student 
deejays to get an equal chance to 
perform,” said, Sixth College senior 
Justin Park, who will compete as DJ 
Skyblu. “Even if you might not know 
the right people, you can have a shot 
of getting in the lineup.”

backgrounds have to do with whether 
or not [they] get in, because I know 
people who are one-eighth of some 
exotic race will write that because it will 
give them a better chance of getting in,” 
she said. “Students should not have to 
resort to white little lies to get in.”

She also said she found the scoring 
system to be arbitrary. When Elizabeth 
applied last year, she was placed on the 
wait list but eventually denied accep-
tance. Officials informed her she had 
not scored as high as other candidates, 
she said. However, according to the 
spreadsheet, students with much lower 
scores were accepted. 

“There are people on that list who 
got in with average scores of 13 and13.5 
when I got a 16.5 out of 18,” she said. 
“They lied to me.”

Elizabeth said admissions officials 
should take into account achievements 
on a global level, such as volunteer work 
and educational experiences abroad, 
instead of directly considering race.

John*, another student who 
declined to be named, created the 
e-mail account concerneducsd@yahoo.
com to spread the word about the issue 
and the ways in which he believed the 
I-House Admittance Committee has 
violated both state and federal laws. 

In an e-mail sent from the account 
to the I-House listserv, John claims 
the selection process violates the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964, specifically the Fair 
Housing Act provision. 

According to the Fair Housing 
Act, it is illegal to base any housing-
related transaction based on factors 
such as race, color, national origin, 
religion and sex. 

Additionally, Title VI of the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimi-
nation on the basis of race, color or 
national origin in programs receiving 
financial assistance from the federal 
government.

International Group Affairs intern 
Jeremy McGrew — a member of 
Gilhoi’s staff — said it is outrageous 
that individuals like John are claiming 
racial discrimination occurs within an 
organization with the opposite mission. 

“The whole point of this place is 
to create diversity and make it a blend 
of everyone from all over the world,” 
McGrew said. “How are we supposed 
to create an International House if we 
don’t know where the heck you are 
from? That is the only reason that line 
exists on the application.”

According to McGrew, it is optional 
to fill in one’s national origin and cul-
tural identity on the application. He 
defended the I-House Admittance 
Committee’s system as “fair and dip-
lomatic.”

“Anyone who is trying to criticize 
the setup of this, or how they run it, is 
trying to throw a wrench in something 
that’s moving very smoothly,” McGrew 
said. “We have a good setup, and good 
people, and good intentions.”

Eleanor Roosevelt College junior 
Pejman Moghbeli, a current I-House 
resident, said he disagreed with the 
decision to accept applicants with lower 
scores than those rejected, but under-
stood why the staff would take cultural 
identity into consideration when facili-
tating an international community.

Elizabeth said she remains con-
vinced that the issue extends beyond 
attempting to create diversity and 
expects I-House officials to provide a 
legitimate explanation for the e-mail. 

“Right now, I just want some 
answers,” she said. “You can’t have 
any point system based on race and 
ethnicity.”

I-House Director Christi Gilhoi was 
unavailable for comment.

Samples, synths, and electronica: if you missed 
STS9 in February, here’s a chance for your 
penitence. Most of RJD2’s tracks ﬂoat chiming, 
nod-away rhythms over a galactic, vacant string 
section, while scrapbook-clipping samples chop 
in and out. When he dips into singer-songwriter 
territory, though, RJD2 trades his spaced-out 
splicing for lyrics that are about as agile as 
the ISS — but he brings funky, slow-dance 
smoothness that’ll have you eyeing the hips 
swaying next to you. What better cure for the 
Mondays? (MP)

Looking for a conﬁdence booster after receiving 
your Winter Quarter grades? Look no further than 
the San Diego Civic Theatre for a pick-me-up that 
doesn’t require illegal substances. That’s right — 
your closet-favorite chick ﬂick from 2001 has been 
adapted to the stage for one Elle of a good time. If 
a bubbly Reese Witherspoon impersonator doesn’t 
put you in a good mood, the bend and snap, the 
perky legal jargon and the purse-riding Chihuahua 
certainly will. Just make sure to dress the part, 
because “whoever said orange was the new pink 
was seriously disturbed.” (JB)

“LEGALLY BLONDE: THE MUSICAL”
CIVIC THEATRE / THROUGH APRIL 4 / $18

By Jenna Brogan
Hiatus Editor

S ince its release into theaters last Friday, Steve Pink’s “Hot Tub Time Machine” has received 
mixed reviews. But whether it be 
wittily stupid or stupidly witty, 
what better way to look at a film 
than through the eyes of the actors. 
On February 15, 2010, two of the 
film’s stars — Craig Robinson 
(Darryl from “The Office”) and 
Clark Duke (Dale from “Greek”) 
— went behind the scenes with 
the Guardian. Get ready for heavy 
drinking, menage a troi-ing and 
barrelling from mountaintops.
The Guardian: What was it like 
shooting “Hot Tub Time Machine”? 
Clark Duke: It was fun, but cold — 
as you would expect with snow.
Craig Robinson: Yeah, dur-
ing the three months we were in 
Vancouver, it was just us and the 
Australians. The resort looked just 
like the hotel in “The Shining.” He 
even broke all the shit in his room!
CD: Hey, we’re in this little bitty 
town and then someone just kicks 
your door open while you’re asleep. 
… I’m not going to lie to you guys, 
I’ve been drinking a lot.
G: If you could go back in time, 
would you change things?
CR: Change? You know, I wouldn’t 
change a thing. Actually, there is 
one girl I wouldn’t have stopped to 
talk to …
G: How did you look 20 years ago?
CD: My head was the same size. I 
almost killed my mother at birth. 
Ha!
CR: I had that haircut — It was 
real high. I majored in music. I was 
a super freshman, all goofy and 
stupid.
G: Were you guys skiers prior to 
filming?
CR: They said, “We need you to 
ski for the movie.” And I said, “I’m 
black.”
CD: All the other guys knew how, 
but not us.
CR: The boots are freaking tight! I 
kept saying, “No, this is too tight!” 
My toes were all scrunched. By 
the third day, I made it down the 
mountain. It would have made 
great extra footage! I snow-plowed 
down the mountain, but I made it

C lash of the Titans” is a cheesy-as-hell remake of a 1981 film that treats Greek mythology as fact, revels in low-grade

M arch 22: I introduced myself to a circle of hardcore rockers from bands with names like 
Vivid Sekt and Bog People by telling 
one of the bassists he looked like “the 
chillest Norse god of war ever.”

He looked over with a constipated 
grin. I consider hauling scrawny 
white ass all the way back to Mira 
Mesa.

“I think you just made his life,” 
said another member of the circle.

The day before, a ukulele player 
declared herself to be ambigender, 

and the show ended as the whole 
audience sat around a harp, cross-
legged like it was story time.

A few months 
before that, I 
termed Tera 
Melos’ music 
“space-thrash,” 
and guitar god 
Nick Reinhart 
nodded in agree-
ment, pedo ’stache and all. 

Welcome to the Che Cafe, the 
schizo home of whatever you want 

— as long as it’s not normal.
I show up half an hour after 

doors. It’s still a wait until the show 
starts, as the 
openers are in a 
constant game of 
chicken with the 
audience to see 
who can show up 
last — but there’s 
room on the 

back-room couch to perch and kill 
some change. Even though I’ll always 
be an omnivore, the Che’s vegan 

kitchen can give the blonde guitarist 
in fishnets and spiked leather some 
competition: $1 soy ice cream sand-
wiches at the shows, and real sugar 
root beer for the same price.

They’re not preachy about the 
veganism, though. Despite horror 
stories I’ve heard of non-vegan bands 
trying to book a show and hitting a 
brick wall (and despite the Animal 
Liberation Front ’zines and posters 
declaring “DESTROY ALL JUDGE

‘Contra Mantra’
Army of the Pharaohs
ENEMY SOIL/ BABYGRANDE

H ow many artists mob the stage with three or eight microphone-
toting homies and nothing 
interesting to say? But when a 
super group of musicians who 
are all on point collaborate, 
it can be beautiful. Army of 
the Pharaoh’s crew of East 
Coast underground MCs — 
assembled by Jedi Mind Trick’s 
Vinnie Paz — present a diverse 
sound but stay connected 

lyrically, spitting bars on the 
state of hip-hop and the rise of 
the underground. Starting out 
with just a break beat, the piece 
gets super thick as DC the Midi 
Alien layers haunting piano 
and guitar samples, matching 
the serious tone of the verses. 
Raw vocal scratches help the 
artists’ message sink in as the 
beat rides out.

‘Crash Years’
The New Pornographers
MATADOR

A fter the restrained lulls present in their last album, Challengers, The 
New Pornographers try to 
prove they can come back from 
the lucrative trough of their 
bygone pop wave. Neko Case’s 
joyful vocals, backed by the 
finely-tuned instrumentation, 
harmoniously lace up latest 
single “Crash Years”. The 
pairing of drums and low-
toned strings is entrancing at 

the opening and close of the 
song. Coupled with jingling 
bells and infectious whistles, 
it’s reminiscent of their earlier 
work, which will have long-
time fans in a tizzy. Case 
and company captivate like a 
multi-car pileup, but you’ll be 
swaying with a smile rather 
than rubber-necking with a 
grimace.

Scorpions
Sting in the Tail
SONY BMG

A fter 26 years of ripping off panties with “Rock You Like A Hurricane,” Sting 
in the Tail is the last album 
for German melody-metalists 
Scorpions. Sting follows their 
familiar two-step formula 
of sexed-up, guitar-driven 
anthems followed by melan-
choly power ballads, but this 
mediocre release won’t earn 
them an encore.

Opener “Raised on Rock” 
reduces the band to a 4/4 
beat-machine trying for 
garage-rock brashness, and 
vocalist Klaus Meine’s trips 
over himself trying for vocal 
complexity. Despite attempts 
at resurrecting bad-boy glory 
nostalgia, the band never 
transcends Bon Jovi wanna-
sleaze. As for the power bal-
lads, well, there’s only so much 

you can do with lyrics strung 
together via madlib.

Then the frantic pace of 
“Rock Zone” hits like a tsuna-
mi, with a chorus that catches 
the playing-for-beer rawness 
that the Scorps have been 
chasing. Follow that with the 
distant synths of power ballad 
“Lorelei,” and it’s a one-two 
punch. Even if the switch from 
guitar verse to stirring chorus 
is predictable, Meine’s smooth 
tenor sets the track soaring.

It’s only a flash flood of 
quality, though. The rest of 
Sting is crammed with trying-
too-hard lyrics written to fit 
predictable rhyme schemes. 
After years of hitting with 
hurricane force, the Scorpions 
appear to have fizzled into a 
bunch of hot air.

She & Him
Volume Two
MERGE RECORDS

Z ooey Deschanel’s dodged the Hollywood archetype of good-actress, terrible-
singer once again, with the 
help and hipster street-cred 
of folkster M. Ward after the 
duo mastered effortless pop on 
2008’s Volume One.

She & Him’s follow-up, 
Volume Two, is a continuation 
of the charming, ‘60s-inspired 
sound the duo perfected on 
their debut, which proves to 
be a blessing and a curse. The 
breezy tunes of this collabora-
tion are unabashedly fun, but 
on repeat they’re a lot less 
charming. 

Deschanel is mostly to 
blame, as Ward seems content 
in the shadows, tinkering in 
the album’s background. In the 
spotlight, Deschanel’s quaint 
voice doesn’t have the emo-
tional range to create moving 

music; even her saddest songs 
are sunny.

The excessive sentimen-
tality and cutesy melodies, 
idealizing the lifestyles of 
Californian youth, make for 
perpetually-adolescent pop. 
When Zooey has the blues, 
it’s teenage blues, and you just 
can’t take high school heart-
break all that seriously. It’s all 
good fun, but both musicians 
are certainly past the puberty-
ridden stages of young love.

That’s not to say the album 
doesn’t offer the perfect 
soundtrack to a California 
summer. M. Ward’s country-
tinged guitar and Deschanel’s 
saccharine croon prove to 
be an endearing, albeit tired 
combination. Nonetheless, the 
album still exudes the expect-
ed twinkly charm.

TRACKREVIEWS

TV Funny Guys Let off  Steam
down.
G: What was your favorite part to film?
CR: There’s a scene where I’m in the hot tub with a young lady 
— I think about it daily. Jessica Paray is her name. It was very 
professional — I only got hard three times. Ha!
CD: That was also my favorite part. I was under the water!
G: Was it fun on set?
CD: Oh, yeah, there was a lot of cracking up. There was a lot 
of “Guys, we have to get to Act Three!”
CR: Look out for “Hot Tub Time Machine 2: Cincinnati.” We 
ain’t going to screen that one — we’re just going to let it out. 
Ha!
G: Were there any practical jokes played on set?
CD: There were a lot of impractical jokes.
CR: Yeah, not really practical. They kept improving — one 
would start and everyone would join in. My door got kicked 
in!
G: What was it like filming scenes with nudity?
CD: There were one too many dudes involved. Cordry’s ass — 
man, every time he’s nude on camera, he’s flexing, sometimes 
making a T. But they put flesh-colored socks over your penis.
CR: They didn’t have any to fit me … 
G: Did you guys know each other before?
CD: We met at the table reading. I met Cusack at a dinner 
before the movie.
CR: Congratulations!
G: There were quite a few smart lines — did you ad-lib any of 
them?
CR: Chevy Chase got to do whatever he wanted, because he’s 
Chevy Chase.
CD: The script changes a lot, and eventually we just say, “Fuck 
the pages!”
CR: Steve Pink is one of the best directors I’ve worked with. 
We’ll be like, “What if we did this?” And he’s like, “Yeah!” And 
it’s like, “BAM! It’s in the trailer!”
G: So, Craig, you sing all the time on “The Office,” and your 
character in this film does as well. Is music your first love?
CR: Music is my first love. I grew up playing in church and at 
recitals. My band Nasty Delicious plays in the movie, too.
G: Did you have any problems while filming?
CD: Being outside when it’s that cold is rough.
CR: Yeah, I had my first sinus infection.
CD: I had to go to the chiropractor after falling down the 
mountain.
CR: In the last scene, we had to be in the hot tub for two days, 
and I was really hungover.
CD: We talk a lot about the guys who aren’t here. … You’re 
probably thinking, are you guys screwing with us?
CR: That’s what she said.
G: So what’s next for you guys in your careers?
CD: I’ve got this new movie called “Kick Ass” that’s coming 
out, plus a film called “1,000 Words” with Eddie Murphy.
CR: I’ve got “Shrek 4,” “Father of Invention” with Kevin 
Spacey, and I’m doing more of “The Office” and touring with 
my band.
G: Why should people see this movie?
CD: It’s … funny?

HIATUS� THURSDAY, APRIL 1, 2010� THE UCSD GUARDIAN�13

if Matt Damon didn’t 
know how to act.

To make things worse, 
the first 15 minutes of 
the film are comprised 
of foreshadow overkill. 
Without a booming intro 
or scrolling text to set the 
scene, we find ourselves 
wondering why these stu-
pid 3-D glasses are rest-
ing on our noses at all. 

Fortunately, the next 
hour provides a signifi-
cant degree of relief. Who 
knows what director 
Louis Leterrier (“The 
Incredible Hulk”) started 
smoking, but the story of 
Perseus — the unwilling 
demigod who must pre-
vent his uncle Hades from 
destroying the human 
race and conquering the 
world — is surprisingly 
captivating. It sounds like 
the plot to a half-baked 
children’s movie, but 
“Titans” is actually quite 
enthralling, and not in the 
horrific train-wreck way 
you might expect.

How it remains 
appealing until the end 
credits is the great mys-
tery. After all, it’s a “Lord 
of the Rings” quest set 
in the location of “Troy,” 
with a villain who looks 
like Voldemort’s twin and 
Liam Neeson as Zeus. But 
for some reason, all those 
contrary elements come 
together to make a piece-
meal film that reflects 
the better qualities in its 
inspirations.

Look out for one 
hilarious “Avatar” parallel 
after another, as Perseus 
rides Pegasus in a scene 

that raises the question 
of why Worthington is so 
good at mounting winged 
fictional creatures. But 
there’s just enough myth 
in “Titans” to create its 
own unique story with a 
touch of campy action, 
which is all we need to sit 
back and enjoy. 

That’s not to say the 
film is without fault. 
Sticklers for Greek 
mythology will find dis-
crepancies in the myths; 
for example, the character 
Io claims a god made her 
immortal as a punish-
ment, when she should 
have turned into a cow. 
However, it’s not hard to 
see why Gemma Arterton 
would have had problems 
emoting from the CGI 
form of a talking quad-
ruped, so that one can be 
overlooked for the sake of 
the story. 

Of course, the major 
blockbuster contains 
more than its share 
of cheese, as lines like 
“Release the Kraken!” 
and “Tame your storm!” 
are delivered in the 
utmost seriousness — 
making for the best 
mindless fun since the 
crotch shot in “LOTR.”

The film’s only serious 
flaw is that it’s not wor-
thy of 3-D. There are no 
overly exciting graphics 
(nor any obnoxious ones, 
for that matter). But if 
you’ve got itch for ancient 
Greece, this one’s pure 
gold; just take my advice 
and save yourself the $3 
extra — who wants to be 
a four-eyed loser for no 
good reason?

— DESTROY ALL POLITICIAN”), 
the Che never gets preachy, even when 
one of the volunteers brings a bag of 
Cheetos to the weekly meeting.

It’s hippie heaven, punk paradise, and 
vegan nirvana — and it’s open to anyone.

It’s just that no one thinks to go there.
OK, that’s a purposely melodramatic 

statement — the turnout is jumpier 
than 1938 Poland, but the Che has 
enough big nights so that core volunteer 
Gregory Prout is confident that it’ll be 
financially stable next year, despite the 
theft of ten grand in sound equipment 
last summer.

For most UCSD students, though, 
that melodrama might as well be true. 
Ask what they think of the Che, and 
you’ll get responses like that of grad stu-
dent Yana Morgulis.

“It looks interesting,” Morgulis said. 
“I’d go there if something was happen-
ing, but I thought it was boarded up.”

For reference, the Che was closed for 
two months because of insurance snafus 
back in Winter Quarter 2009.

You’d think the Che’s volunteers 
never thought of posting flyers in the 
Muir College quad. But there is, in fact, 
outreach going on — just on a small 
scale. Marshall College senior and core 
volunteer Alice Nash will be tabling at 
Admit Day next Saturday, trying to get 
some pre-frosh blood back into the Che.

There’s even some who choose to 
reach out to the Che. Jerry Chai, Revelle 
College sophomore and member of the 
Deejays and Vinylphiles Club, is hoping 
to organize a dance party at the Che 
and said the collective’s volunteers have 
been open to the idea. The DVC draws 
about 25 times the Che’s capacity to 
Let’s Bounce every year, and if the sold-
out success of the Non-Sexist Dances is 
any indication, the Che should probably 
expect the fire marshal to drop by. 

With any luck, some UCSD students 
will make a habit of doing the same.

FESTIVALPREVIEW

Revellution
T he birth of Revellution — Revelle’s first-ever music festival — has been decidedly under the radar. So under the radar, in fact, that most people don’t know it exists.  Add a rapidly 
approaching April 1 concert date, and one begins to speculate that Revellution may just be a grand, 
misguided hoax. However, with a lineup finally released, there is now a bit more evidence that this 
thing might actually be happening.  Headliners Story of the Year and Terrible Things will take the 
stage on Thursday to prove that maybe — just maybe — Revelle can rage with the best of them.

Perhaps best known for their 2004 breakthrough hit 
“Until the Day I Die,” Story of the Year is determined 
to tear out your eardrums come Thursday. Along with 
openers Quietdrive, the unabashedly screamo five-
piece demonstrates the festival organizers’ apparent 
goal to create UCSD’s very own mini Warped Tour. 
Story of the Year’s raucous lyrics and heavy break-
downs call for more fist-pumping than dancing, but 
that’s not to say the band strays from melody. As their 
explosive choruses surely prove, the guys have always 
had an ear for pop. Expect boisterous sing-alongs 
and pushy crowds at the this installment of the band’s 
notoriously energetic live performance record. They 
will most likely spotlight tracks from their February 
release The Constant — another loud, angry disc in 
the band’s nearly one-note repertoire.

"9�!2)%,,%�3!,,!)�s�34!&&�72)4%2

Terrible 
Things

Terrible Things is a hodge-
podge crew of Warped Tour 
veterans featuring Fred 
Mascherino (ex-Taking 
Back Sunday, The Color 
Fred), Andy Jackson (Hot 
Rod Circuit), Steve Lucarelli 
(ex-Once Nothing) and Josh 
Eppard (ex-Coheed And 
Cambria). The group doesn’t 
stray too far from the decid-
edly pop-punk and/or sounds 
produced by their previous 
bands, but don’t pee yourself 
waiting eagerly for any Taking 
Back Sunday wails or Coheed 
and Cambria prog solos; no, 
these guys keep it simple. It’s 
all catchy choruses, three-
chord guitar and deeply emo-
tional vocals that make you 
tear up a little bit when things 
get deep. The band manages 
to sound like a combination of 
the Foo Fighters prototypical 
modern rock and the tradi-
tional emo of Sunny Day Real 
Estate. With an unexpected 
spring release date for their 
debut LP, look forward to the 
band throwing down some 
new head-bobbers at the show.

provide an addictive, intoxicat-
ing rush. Now that I’ve gotten the 
obligatory joke about Rangers 
manager Ron Washington’s positive 
cocaine test out of the way, I’ll tell 
you why this team could make its 
first playoff appearance since 1999 
— even with a druggie leader. Ian 
Kinsler might be the best second 
baseman not named Chase, and 
right fielder Nelson Cruz is still one 
of baseball’s best-kept secrets. If 
starting pitcher Rich Harden pulls 
out even half his uninjured poten-
tial, the Rangers could surprise a 
lot of people.
My Predictions
Division champ: Seattle Mariners
In the hunt: Los Angeles Angels of 
Anaheim
Fantasy sleeper: Scott Feldman, 
Texas Rangers Starting Pitcher
Story to watch: If Ron Washington 
will continue to conjure Rick James.

2) American League Central
No AL Central team has made it 

to the World Series since the White 
Sox won it all in 2005, and I don’t 
think that’s about to change this 
season. Each of the five teams has 
something great going for it, but 
not one has enough to push it over 
the top.

The Twins signed local hero and 
catcher Joe Mauer to a staggering 
eight-year, $184-million contract 
extension, but are hurt by the loss 
of All-Star closer Joe Nathan to sea-
son-ending Tommy John surgery 
on his throwing elbow.

The White Sox have the insane 
brilliance of manager Ozzie 
Guillen, but cannot win by relying 
on an outfield of MLB rejects like 
Alex Rios, Juan Pierre and Andruw 
Jones. 

The Tigers could make a run 
at the division now that Johnny 
Damon’s re-grown beard is roam-

ing the field, but ace pitcher Justin 
Verlander’s erratic performance the 
past few seasons is a big problem.

The Cleveland Indians have 
heartthrob Grady Sizemore roam-
ing center field and the young 
power of firstbaseman Matt 
LaPorta, but with Jake Westbrook 
as their Opening Day start-
ing pitcher, baseball in October 
remains a dream for the Tribe.

And except for reigning Cy 
Young winner Zach Greinke, the 
Kansas City Royals have little to 
offer baseball fans — or their AL 
competition.
My Predictions
Division champ: Minnesota Twins
In the hunt: Detroit Tigers
Fantasy sleeper: Max Scherzer, 
Detroit Tigers starting pitcher

Twitter account

3) American League East
Following their unparalleled 

27th World Series championship, 
the New York Yankees somehow 
managed to shed payroll while 
improving their team. Gone are 
Johnny Damon and Hideki Matsui 
(and their bulging contracts), and 
here to stay are outfielders Curtis 
Granderson and Randy Winn, 
infielder/DH Nick Johnson and 
starting pitcher Javier Vazquez.

Yankees general manager Brian 
Cashman should be credited for 
overseeing an offseason that has 
turned the defending champs into 
a more streamlined club — one 
that now has more bench depth 
and cost efficiency. No matter 
how good A-Rod might be, I will 
always hate baseball’s richest and 
cockiest player. Mark Teixeira and 
CC Sabathia, on the other hand, 
seem like good guys that play hard 
and stay humble, so I guess not all 
members of the Evil Empire have 
fully crossed over to the dark side.

Last season’s AL Wild Card 
winners, the Boston Red Sox, roll 
in from spring training after land-
ing the offseason’s top pitching 
free agent, John Lackey. Boston 
will hope this makes up for losing 
their the top offensive free agent 
of 2009 in left fielder Jason Bay. 
A pitching lineup of Lackey, Jon 
Lester, Josh Beckett and Dice-K is 
dangerous any day of the week, and 
with Jonathan Papelbon closing out 
games, the boys from Beantown are 
looking solid. 

Only a few years removed from 
the dredges of professional baseball, 
the Tampa Bay Rays have quickly 
built themselves into a competitive 
organization. Their early season 
success will determine whether or 
not their two star players — out-
fielder B.J. Upton and first baseman 
Carlos Pena — will be signed to 
contract extensions or traded off at 
July’s trading deadline.

Look for young pitching phe-
nom David Price to have a breakout 
season and cement himself as one 
of the premier left-handed pitchers 
in baseball.
My predictions
Division champ: New York Yankees
In the hunt: Boston Red Sox
Fantasy sleeper: Brian Matusz, 
Baltimore Orioles starting pitcher 
(and University of San Diego alum) 
Story to follow: How many games 
will Kate Hudson show up to at 
Yankee Stadium to root for her 
squeeze, Alex Rodriguez?

Thus concludes this year’s edi-
tion of my MLB preseason predic-
tions. So tune in this Sunday for 
Opening Day 2010, pour yourself 
a frosty beverage and practice your 
bleacher-bum taunts, because we 
have 162 glorious games ahead of 
us.

Oh, and just in case you 
weren’t quite sure yet, I think Alex 
Rodriguez is a douche.

12-3 victory to seal the series sweep. 
Senior first baseman Brandon 
Gregorich went three-for-four with 
two doubles, two runs and two runs 
batted in (RBI), while junior sec-
ond basemen Blake Tagmyer added 
three RBIs and two runs. They con-
tinued to eat up Seawolves pitching 
until the ninth inning.

Sonoma dropped to 9-13, 2-10 in 
CCAA play.

Prior to the series against Cal 
Poly Pomona, UCSD hosted Cal 
State San Marcos in a non confer-
ence game on March 22, coming out 
on top 8-4.

Junior catcher Kellen Lee deliv-
ered a three-hit game, including 
a home run and three RBIs. The 
Tritons sent out nine different pitch-
ers in the game to keep their arms 
fresh for league play.

In a home-and-home series — in 
which each team plays host for two 
of four series games — the Tritons 
swept Cal Poly Pomona in back-
to-back matchups in Pomona on 
March 25 and March 26.

The Tritons then won both 
games in a doubleheader at Triton 
Ballpark on March 27 to complete 
the four-game sweep.

Shibuya dominated off the 
mound once again for the Tritons in 
game one, coasting through seven 
innings conceding just one earned 
run.

Kehoe provided three RBIs and 
senior shortstop Vance Albitz added 
three hits, allowing UCSD to ease 
into a 7-3 win. 

Rossman pitched all nine innings 
to go the distance in game two, 
allowing two unearned runs on five 
hits.

The complete game effort was 
just enough for a 5-2 victory –one 
that Rossman said was mentally and 
physically taxing.

“We talk about the mental game 
a lot, and it’s something we take 
pride in,” Rossman said. “The aver-
age fan doesn’t realize how mental 

baseball is, and the average team 
doesn’t spend enough time work-
ing on it. Physically, it’s exhausting. 
It was pretty hot in Pomona, and 
I definitely didn’t cruise through 
that game. I didn’t have my best 
stuff, and had to battle my way 
out of some jams I put myself in. 
Mentally, I keep telling myself out 
there, ‘They will not beat me.’ I hate 
to lose.”

Triton Ballpark provided no ref-
uge for Pomona. They were demol-
ished 11-0 in game three thanks to 
a scoreless seven-inning effort out 
of senior pitcher Kirby St. John and 
an offensive show by junior second 
baseman Blake Tagmyer.

Tagmyer opened the game with a 
three-RBI double in the first inning 
and a three-run home run in the 
second. His six RBIs and St. John’s 
impressive pitching was too much 
for the Broncos to handle, and the 
Tritons won easily.

The final game in the series was 
highlighted by a gutsy performance 
from Knudson, who threw over five 
innings while allowing four hits and 
two earned runs.

Junior outfielder Kyle Saul was 
one at-bat short of the natural cycle, 
going 3-3; Kehoe added a home run; 
and Cal Poly Pomona fell to 17-16 
overall and 9-11 in CCAA action.

With their series sweep of Cal 
Poly Pomona, the Tritons surpassed 
UCSD’s school record of 16 con-
secutive wins, pushing their streak 
to 19 games.

While the No. 1 ranking earned 
the Tritons some respect, Kehoe 
said expectations will only rise.

“The No. 1 ranking is more of 
a recognition thing than anything,” 
Kehoe said. “The rankings really 
don’t mean anything besides the 
fact that we are getting some respect 
nationally. We know we deserve the 
No. 1 ranking because we know we 
are the best team in the country, 
but it doesn’t change the way we go 
about things at all. We still show up 
every day and outwork everyone 

else in the nation.”
Kehoe says the team’s success is 

rooted in the players’ work ethic. 
“The mentality we have is that 

we may not have the most talent in 
the nation, but we have outworked 
everyone else,” Kehoe said. “We play 
teams that we know haven’t worked 
as hard as we have — and that, in 
turn, makes us feel we deserve it 
more. Nineteen straight is a prod-
uct of knowing we are better than 
everyone else, outworking the other 
team and trusting our preparation 
— nothing more.”

Thus far, the season’s success has 
been attributed to consistency in 
every area of play: the rotation, 
lineup, bullpen and bench. 

At the top of the rotation, 
Rossman and junior right-hander 
Tim Shibuya have served as an 
outstanding 1-2 punch. Rossman 
now stands 6-0 with a 2.17 Earned 
Run Average (ERA), while Shibuya 
stands at 7-0 with a 2.22 ERA.

Junior designated hitter Aaron 
Bauman leads the Triton offense 
with a .444 batting average and an 
astonishing .603 on-base percent-
age. Gregorich leads the team with 
an impressive 46 RBI so far this 
season. 

The Tritons will now set their 
sights on Cal State San Bernadino, 
working to keep the streak alive in 
another home-and-home series this 
weekend. The Coyotes are currently 
16-10 overall and 15-9 in CCAA 
play. 

“No one talks about the fact that 
we have won 19 straight,” Rossman 
said. “Sure, we all know it, but the 
important thing is that we are only 
focused on the future and getting 
better. We talk about taking things 
one game, one inning and one out at 
a time. That keeps us in the present 
and doesn’t allow us to get caught 
up in external hype that is out of 
our control.”

HOTCORNERNUMBER CRUNCHER 

KIRSTEN BATES | W. WATER POLO
The sophomore cannot seem to stop scoring this season, 
netting 12 times in UCSD’s four wins at the Cal State 
Bakersfield Roadruner Invitational from March 27
to March 28. 

68
The score that UCSD junior golfer Richard Morris
shot in the final round of the Grand Canyon 
Thunderbird Invitational on March 30.

Despite my lifelong hatred of the American League and its mission to ruin base-
ball via the designated hitter, Alex 
Rodriguez and the city of Anaheim, 
I have to admit that sometimes, it’s 
not so bad. Over the past couple 
of years, it has produced a quality 
brand of ball that even we National 
League-purists can stomach. Teams 
like the Tampa Bay Rays, the 
Minnesota Twins and the Texas 
Rangers are succeeding by relying 
on young, homegrown talent that 
cut the big boys in New York and 
Boston down to size.

So it is with slightly less disdain 
than normal that I give my predic-
tions for the 2010 American League 
baseball season.
1) American League West

For the first time in recent 
memory, the Los Angeles Angels of 
Anaheim (a constant flame to my 
AL-fueled anger) will not start the 
season as division favorites. Losing 
ace pitcher John Lackey to the Red 
Sox leaves the Halos’ rotation in the 
hands of the goldie-locked Jered 
Weaver and Scott Kazmir, who has 
yet to live up to his Tampa Bay 
glory days after being traded to Los 
Angeles last season. The addition of 
World Series MVP Hideki Matsui 
at designated hitter to complement 
Kendry Morales and Torii Hunter 
will keep their offensive attack 
scary as ever, but in the AL’s most 
exciting division, they just might 
not be enough. 

The Angels should be espe-
cially wary, considering the Seattle 
Mariners are baseball’s most 
improved team after an offseason 
that saw them add ex-Phillies ace 
Cliff Lee and ex-Angels leadoff 
man Chone Figgins to their ranks. 
With Lee and King Felix Hernandez 
at the top of the rotation, the 
Mariners will have the best one-two 
punch in the league and will thrive 
off the spacious, pitching-friendly 
outfield of Safeco Field. If manager 
Don Wakamatsu and the ageless 
Ken Griffey Jr. can help newly 
acquired outfielder Milton Bradley 
find inner peace, the 2010 Mariners 
might bring Seattle its first-ever AL 
pennant. 

Similarly, watching this year’s 
Texas Rangers perform will surely

BASEBALL — Already having amassed 
a school-record 19-game winning streak 
since their Feb. 19 loss to Chico State 
University, the UCSD baseball team can 
now add the nation’s No. 1 ranking to its 
growing list of accolades in 2010.

The Tritons swept their series against 
Cal State Sonoma State University from 
March 12 to March 14 to earn the No. 
1 ranking, then continued to dominate 
another four-game series against Cal Poly 
Pomona over spring break between March 
25 and March 27. They improved their 

record to 28-3 overall and 18-2 in California 
Collegiate Athletic Association play.

But according to senior pitcher Matt 
Rossman, the No. 1 spot and record win 
streak hasn’t gone to the players’ heads. 
Rossman emphasized that the team must 
hold onto its humility throughout the sea-
son.

“The No.1 ranking is cool,” Rossman 
said. “It’s an honor, and we have earned it. 
Our success and recognition is providing 
even more motivation for us. We aren’t 
satisfied with where we’re at, and know 
that we still have things to improve upon.”

In a four-game home stand against 
Sonoma State, the Tritons did not leave 

much room for error. They made easy work 
of the Seawolves on an effective balance of 
pitching and offense, earning another four 
victories to tack to their last 15.

In the opener, junior right-hander Tim 
Shibuya was nearly unhittable, throwing 
eight innings of two-hit ball. UCSD cruised 
to a 10-2 win behind Shibuya’s arm, and 
followed with solid pitching efforts from 
Rossman and junior right-hander Guido 
Knudson to take games two and three by 
scores of 9-7 and 4-3.

Game four of the series saw an offensive 
outburst, as UCSD exploded for 15 hits in a 

Chart Toppers
The UCSD baseball team earns the No. 1 ranking in Division-II, thanks to a

momentum that senior pitcher Matt Rossman attributes to the team’s “mental game.”
