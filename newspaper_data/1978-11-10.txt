McElroy, Michetti Talk Center Funds 
By Reed Alpel1 

Edtaor 
Funding for the Day Care 

Center emerged as a crucial 
issue in the fate of the Center 
yesterday as the Day Care 
Information Board met sep-
arately with Chancellor Wil-
liam McElroy and Business 
Manaier Laura Michetti. 

McElroy told the Board 
yesterday morning that he 
supports the Day Care 'Center 
and would like to see 1t ex-
panded, but qualified that by 
adding, "Just get the money, 
tell me where the money's 
coming from. That's the prob-
lem." 

Michetti, who spoke to the 
Board in the afternoon, said 
that the reason McElroy had 

looked into bidding out opera-
tion of the Center last year to a 
private company was that it 
would "solve the dilemma ... we 
have with salary costs (at the 
Center) ." 

About 90 percent of the 
Center's budget goes to sal-
aries, Michetti said. Private 
day care centers pay less 
wages to their employees, 
enabling them to operate at a 
lower cost, Michetti said. These 
private centers employ per-
sonnel with less training in 
child care and education than 
does the UCSD Center; also, 
private centers are not certi-
fied by the State Department of 
Education as educational 
centers, as is UCSD Center. 
. Durin~ the Information 

Board hearings du 'ng the past 
two weeks , parents have 
criticized the private centers 
for providing babysitting 
services rather than educa-
tional experiences which they 
claim the UCSD Center has. 
McElroy expressed a different 
view yesterday, saying, "I 
question the concept of educa-
tional programs." He added 
that he feels not a lot is lost 
educationally in a private 
center as opposed to the UCSD 
Center. 

Michetti said this year the 
Center will be funded mainly 
through a State Department of 
Education (SDE) grant, Stu-
dent Registration Fees and 
parent fees. In the past, sources 
such as Chancellor's discre-

tionary funds and United Way 
monies have been used, but are 
no longer available, she said. It 
was thought that due to Propo-
sition 13 the SDE funds this 
year may be jeapordized, but 
the legislature did not cut SDE 
funds when it passed the state 
budget, she added . 

McElroy said the reason 
faculty and staff children were . 
phased out of the Center this 
summer was that the Adminis-
tration sought to allot spaces in 
the Center to "where the 
greatest hardship was" and 
this turned out to be with the 
students. " They (faculty and 
staff) were able to find in the 
community adequate facili-
ties," McElroy &aid . 

Michetti also told the Board 

that the Business Office is 
giving Josie Foulks, the Cen-
ter' s director, an intensive 
training program in adminis-
trative techniques in order that 
she can adequately carry out 
the administrative portion of 
her duties. 

Foulks was fired by the 
University this ' summer Cor 
allegedly being unable to 
handle the administrative 
aspect of her job, and was later 
reinstated after a Personnel 
Appeals Committee found the 
charges insufficient to warrant 
dismissal . 

The Center has been charged 
approximately $3000 to handle 
Foulks' back pay during the 
time her case was under 
appeal, Michetti said.

Council Approves Fund 
Prote_ters Say AS Funds Anti-Semites 

By JeD Beresford-Howe 
AIIodate New. Edt ... 

After heated debate involv-
ing Council members and 
approximately forty studentl 
in attendance, the AS Wednes-
day night approved an alloca-
tion of $510 to the National 
Alliance Against Racism and 
Political Oppression. 

At issue was US of that 
allocation, planned by the 
National Alliance to help 
defray expenses involved in 
bringing a speaker from the 
National Lawyer's Guild on 
campus to speak about prob-
lems involving illegal immi-
gration. 

Council members Bill Fried-
man and Phil Ganazer, as well 
as a contingent of the Union of 
Jewish Students, told tbe 
Council that the Guild was an 
anti-semetic organization. 
Friedman, Commiuioner of 
Communications, said he could 
"not differentiate between 
those who are anti-zionist and 
those who are anti-semetie," 

and read a statement from the 
Anti-Defamation Leque of the 
B'nai B'rith wbicb CODdemned 
the Guild becaue of it. alleled 
support of the PalestiDe Libera-
tion Organization. 

The meeting was disrupted 
when the Council voted to close 
debate on consideration of the 
allocation before any of the 
audience had the chance to 
speak. Maurice Wainer, op-
posing the funding, repeatedly 
shouted that he wanted a voice 
in where his money was spent, 
and attacked the Lawyer's 
Guild . After a recess, the 
Council re-opened debate, and 
Wainer and the other audience 
members were allowed to 
speak. 

Wainer told the Council that 
the Guild never opposed Hit-
ler's rise to power, and bis 
genocidal policies after that. 
Wainer also said that lbe Guild 
supported the "terroristic" 
PLO, and that fundinglJ ~uild 
speaker would be offensive to 
the 2,000 (Jews) on campus. 

Tim Barker, a Guild repre-
sentative, defended his organi-
zation, sayiq that the Guild 
stood for human rights, not 
their denial, and added that 
Michael Shey" the speaker 
planned by the National Al-
liance, was himself Jewish, 
with two Jewish parents who 
ned from Hitler's Germany. 

Ganazer stated that 60% of 
the Guild was Jewish. 

After attempts to separate 
the $25 from the rest of the 
National Alliance budget 
failed, the Council approved the 
entire allocation by an 8-5 vote, 
with three abstentions. 

In other action Wednesday 
night, the Council: 

-approved formation of a 
Vending Machine Task Force 
to deal with problems involved 
in chanaing vending machine 
revenue away from the four 
colleges and towards the 
Housine and Food Services 
administration: 

-approved fundin, for

Beckley'Resigns, 
Pleads ~ No 
Contest in Court 

By Jeff Beresford-Howe 
As ociate New Editor 

Jim Beckley has resigned as 
Muir College Dean and has pled 
nolo contendere to one felony 
charge of possession of blank 
checks with intent to ' defraud. 

Two other charges against 
B~ckley , receiving stolen 
property and forgery of legal 
documents with intent to 
defraud " were dropped in 
exchange for the nolo con-
tendere plea. Beckley will 
undergo sentencing December 
8. 

Two San Diego attorneys , 
familiar with Superior Court 
sentencing procedures , say 
that it is likely that Beckley, a 
first-time offender, will receive 
probation. 

Beckley said yesterday that 
he is "100% certain" that he 
will be transferred to legal 
services, where he says he will 
work in a research position, 
studying new activities and 
programs. 

Nick Atma of the Personnel 
Office, in charge of dealing with 
the Beckley case for the 
University, refused to confirm 
that, or discuss the case in any 
way. Muir Provost Stewart and 
Vice-Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Richard Armitage also 
declined comment on the case, 
saying that for Beckley's 
protection before the court, 
they could not discuss Beck-
ley's difficulties. 

Raphael Levens, Legal Serv-
ices Director, did, however, 
confirm yesterday that Beck-
ley would be working for Legal 
Services. 

Stewart did say that re-
placing Beckley has not yet 
been discussed in the adminis-
tration, and that when it is, it 
will probably be the end of this 
year before a new Dean is 
selected. 

Any Dean from outside 

UCSD , Stewart said , would 
have commitments to another 
school until the end ofthisyea r , 
but Stewart did not rule out the 
po sibility of an application 
from Judith Green, currently 
Acting Dean until a permanent 
Dean is found . 

Beckley said he resigned as 
Dean of Muir .. at his own 
request," under no pressure 
from any administration per-
sonnel. 

He also said yesterday that

A Single, Parent and the Day Care Center 
EdItor: 

TIle GunBu's cover. of 
tbe 8nt em,. of tbe Day Care 
lDformatioa Board beartDp Ja 
wbat prompts me to apeak my 
miDd in your "free" column. 
You are reportint only part of 
wliat ia JOinI 011. The testimony 
of tbe pareDt. that bave 
appeared 11 missiD,. Tbe 
followiq ia part of my testj-
mODy. 

The DCIB is compoeed of 7 
ooa-parent students. I am very 
cODcerned tbat tbis vital 
question is beiDl decided by 
people who don't know whatit's 
like to be a parent. To wly 
understand the issue. here, you 
must know how parents feel. 

I am a single parent student. 
My day starts at 4: 00 am and is 
full until 6: 00 pm when I devote 
time to my 3-year-old dauehter, 
Rasbelle . I study, attend 
classes, work, shop for and 
prepare breakfast, lunch and 
dinner, bathe, dress, and play 
with Rashelle and then I try to 
find time to study some more. 

I'm surprised at some stu-
dent's attitudes ahout wbo'sjob 
it is to stay home and watch the 
kids. In my case there just is no 
one else. It's a fact that tbe 
country 's divorce rate is 
nearing one half the marriage 
rate. Althougb it is changing, 
the woman is still taking the 
majority of the responsibility 
for the children. This, along 
with the changing role of 
women in our society neces-
sitates cbild care. 

It is very easy for a single 
woman with children to get on 
Aid to Families .with Depen-
dent Children. To get off or stay 
off welfare , child care is 
essential, especially for single 
parents. 

I'm very concerned that the 
care Rashelle gets rills all of 
her needs; developmental as 
well as emotional. I want 
teacbers who will respect and 
love her and an atmosphere 
conducive to growth. Most 
important for me is that 
Rashelle learn values and gain 
a picture of herself that is good, 
assertive, objective and loving. 
Her self image is something she 
will carry with her for the rest 
of her life. 1 want Rashelle to be 
prepared to face this world. 

I felt separation pains and 
guilt at having other people 

care for my daughter. But I 
reaIDe eveD more that if we 
both stayed home, we would 
stapte. Social interaction for 
us both on our own level is 
neceuary for our development. 

The UCSD Day Care Center 
has everytblna I want in a 
.urrogate parent-family en-
vironment. The atmosphere i. 
stimulating. IJ'OWiDl, lovinl 
and always stable. Rashelle 
cares about her teachers. She 

loves school and sometimes 
WaDt to stay aU DiJht. 

RasheUe was at a private 
profit center for 2 day.. She 
cried all day. No ODe was 
available to comfort her. [ saw 
S adults and about SO kids. No 
one eveD had enouth time to 
change her pants when .he wet 
them. We didn't ,0 back there. 

How much is day care worth? 
In the past, it was accepted that 
the woman cared for the kids. 

She received DO salary. I'm 
afraid tbe8e archaic ideas are 
beiDg carried to day care 
teachers. A maD doesn't pay for 
bIa wile to keep the kids. So men 
fiJure anyone elae who care. 
for children should let a low 
(comparable) salary. 

Take another look. Day care 
teacbers are professional •. 
This is their life's work. They 
need and deaerve decent pay 
for their work. Moreover, they 

are takiq care of our children, 
our future. At thi. youq age 
their very minds are formiDg. 
This i. no job for aD inex-
perienced, uncarlnl, under-
paid person. 

I have carefuUy explored my 
alternatives. If the SDE fund-
ing (educational prolram 
deleted) iJ removed or if the 
UCSD Center cloees, I will go 
back OD AFDC. I lmow that 
otherSDE centers have waiting 
lists of 2,000 and are inacces-
sible on a bike. It'. DOt feasible 
for me to work more. (I'd have 
to pay for care while I worked 
too.) ADd I just can't afford 
anything else. 

If you're concerned about 
higb costs, consider the long 
run. Supporting a woman and 
kids on welfare for life is much 
more expensive than support-
ing quality cbild care whicb is 
an essential in gettina people 
off welfare. 

My main concern is that 
people who aren't parents are 
deciding this issue. Eventually 
the wbole student body will be 
voting. What is Important is 
that you examine what is 
involved. It doesn't boil down to 
dollars and cents. U's people's 
lives, the very quality of life 
that is at issue here.

I am writing this letter to 
bring to the attention of UCSD 
students wbat occurred at the 
AS council meeting on Wednes-
day, Nov. I. The AS had to vote 
on wbether or not to fund a 
speaker for a student organiza-
tion called the National Al-
liance Against Racism and 
Political Repression. The 
speaker that the Alliance 
wishes to bring to UCSD is a 
member of the National Law-
yer's Guild which is an avowed 
supporter of the Palestine 
Liberation Organization. Many 
Jewish students who wished to 
voice their oppositiolQl to this 
measure gathered in the back 
of the North Conference Room 
on Wednesday ni,ht. The AS 
attempted to vote on the 
measure without any student 
discussion until members of 
both .ide. demanded that 
students he heard. A recess had 
to be called and the council 
members, theD, acknowledged 
the need for a diSCUlSion. The 
discussion took place, the 
measure was voted on, and the 
committee decided to fund the 
speaker.

what went on. Firstly, the AS 
Council tried to vote on an issue 

. which concerns every student . 
without as much as even one 
comment by a-atudent. If it was 
not for two students yelling and 
demanding that they be heard, 
there never would have been a 
discussion. Is this how the AS 
represents the students of 
UCSD? If the AS is here to serve 
the students then why is it that 
the council didn't have the time 
to listen? I urge you ,to go to a 
meeting and see for yourself 
what goes on.

TEHRAN. I .... (AP) -Shah 
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi's 
anti-corruption drive, aimed at 
calmini the popular unrest that 
has shaken his rule, reached 
into the haUs of the Iranian 
Parliament on Thursday. A 

US Aid Cut Off-Somoza 
MANAGUA. Nlcarapa (AP) 

- President Anastasio Somoza 
said Thursday the United 
States has cut of( all aid to 
Nicaragua and cbareed that 
.. certain members" of tbe 
Carter administration "want to 
ruin the reputation of my 
government. " 

Semoza told reporters all 
U.S. aid "including credits that 
had already beeD approved" 
has been cut off. He said some 
U.S. officials want him to 
resip, but refused to name 
them. 

The Broad Opposition Front, 
a coalltion of l!'Oups opposed to 
Somoza's rule, has insisted he 
resip and said trouble in this 
strife-tom country will not end 
until he doe •. Somoza bas 
vowed to stay in office until his 
term expires in 1981. 

ID another development, the 
country's only le,al opposition 
party announced it bad ordered 
aU its members of parliament, 
judles and other government 
officials to resign to further 
isolate Somoza. 

Eduardo Chamorro Coronel, 
political secretary of the 
Conservative Party, said the 
decision was made to "pres-
sure Somoza and brine about 

his resignation as soon as 
possible. " 

The party has 40 members in 
the lower house of the Nicara· 
guan Parliament and 20 in the 
Senate. Somoza's Liberal 
Nationalist Party has 60 
deputies and 35 .enators. 

Nicaragua has been plagued 
by civil strife and political 
crisis since fdJanuary, wben a 
popular opposition newspaper 
pubUsher was assassinated. In 
September, the leftist Sand-
Ini.ta National Liberation 
Front led an uprising that took 
Somoza'. 7,500-man Dational 
guard - the country's army 
and pollce force - two weeks to 

put down. The Red Cross said 
1,500 persons were killed in the 
revolt. 

The opposition agreed to talk 
with the Somoza government 
only through a U.S.-led foreign 
mediating team. 

President Carter, at a news 
conference Thursday in Kansas 
City, said the mediating effort 
in Nicara,ua is aimed at 
settinJ up a ,overnment that 
will bave the full support of the 
Nicaraeuan people. 

Carter implied that any 
lastinl solution to the unrest in 
Nicaragua mUit involve a 
deciaion by Somoza to step 
down before his elected term 
ends in 1981.

glass market. 

A key opposition leader, 
meanwhile, was reported 
headed 'back to Iran, but there 
appeared little likelihood of 
face-to-face talks with the shah 
to negotiate an end to the 
country's political crisis. 

An uneasy peace prevailed in 
this capital city, center of 
violent anti-shah protests last 
weekend that led to the fall of 
Iran's civilian administration 
and the shah's appointment of a 
military-led government. 
Troops backed by armored 
vehicles and machine gun-
mounted trucks guarded gov-
ernment buildings and pa-
trolled key locations through-
out the city. 

Dozens of political figures , 
including a former prime 
minister, have been arrested 80 
far in the anti-corruption 
campaign. Yesterday, the 
roundup reached into the lower 
house of the Iranian Parlia-
ment, which lifted the im-
unity of Deputy Mansur YasiDi 
so he could be prosecuted for 
alleged industrial profiteering. 

A report by a parliamentary 
investigation committee 
charged that Yasini, who owns 
all three of Iran's glass fac-
tories, had caused a seven·fold 

increaae in glau prices to $1.35 
per square foot. 

The committee said the 
politician-industrialist had set 
up a subsidiary corporation so 
he could control both produc-
tion and distribution and 
arbitrarily jack up prices. 

Former Prime Minister 
Amir Abbas Hoveyda, arrested 
Wednesday, had been one ofthe 
shah's closest confidants. 
Military police did not say why 
Hoveyda was arrested, but 1 
reliable sources said be was r 
accused of misuse of power 
during his term as government I 
head, 1964-77. ) 

After naming the military 
government, tbe shah an-
nounced he would vigorously 
prosecute corruption in Iran, 
one of the demands made by the 
opposition during months of 
bloody anti-government riot- ,( 
ing. ' 

The shah's foes also charged • 
that many persons close to the i 
imperial palace had amassed ? 
fortunes ,especially during q 
Hoveyda's administration. In a b 
further gesture to the opposi-
tion, the shah ordered res-
pected legal expert J amalidden 
Akhavi to head an investigation 
into the reputedly vast holdings 
of 64 of the shab's closest \ 
relatives, including his sisters J 
and brothers. )

Group Sues UC Over Theft 
By JeeelyJI LartiD 

As a result of the failure of a 
settlement conference last 
month, fourteen UCSD students 
are su..., the Retents of the 
Unlvenlty of California for the 
replacement of stereo equip-
ment .toIen from the dorms 
during the Cbristmas break of 
1m. 

The .tudents were assured by 
the Resident Dean Paula Hui 
and a newaletter they received 
that It was safe to leave stereo 
equipment In the Warren-(then 
called FourtbJ ColIe,e donna 
for the winter break, provided 
they locked equipment in their 
closets, accordln, to one 
student Involved, TIm BonatUi. 

Despite locked doors and 
windows, buri1arles did occur 
in several of the dorms , 
resultiDJln the 1011 of property 
totaling $OIt. PoUce investi-
gation turned up no significant 
clues to the crime. 

AccordiDi to the students' 
attorney, the students feel that 
the Regents were nellilent in 
their security precautions and 
sbould provide compensation 
for lost property. _ 

Three years after the fact, at 
a settlement hearinl held last 
month, attorneys representing 
the students and the Regents 
were unable to reach any 
a,reement on the action. 

Jobn McGuire, lelal repre-
sentative for the Regents in the 
case, advised them not to make 
any settlement because "If 
someone burllarizes an apart-
ment you are renting, you don't 
sue the landlord." McGuire 
argued that the students were 
informed at the beginning or 

Bicycle 
locks 
Available 

UCSD commuter students 
who ride tbeir bicycles to 
campus may lOOn bave availa-
ble to them large, metallocken 
in wbieb to store their bicycles 
during the day and nllbt. 

The locken are the idea of 
two Warren CoUe,e Commuter 
Board members, Adrian Hoban 
and Mark Schulze. The locken, 
wbicb are cummUy in use at 
San Diego State University and 
at many other UC campuses, 
would give student. a safe 
place' to leave tbelr bikes 
ovemlght with adequate pro-
tection a,alnlt tbeft and 
weather, said Schulze. 

Schulze said commuter 
blken are not allowed to lock 
their bikes In front of the dorms 
overnight and consequently 
have no ,ood place to leave 
them. 

In order to pay for the locken 
Schulze and Hoban are lookIn, 
to the AS, the Chancellor's 
discretionary funda and Park-
ing Services. Tbey are also 
conaiderlq rentiDi the locken 
to the commuters at a coat of 
about $10 per quarter. Scbulze 
said be knows of a number of 
biken who would be wlllina to 
pay for the use of a locker. 

They would lUre to see the 
lockers placed near Revelle, 
Muir and Third Quads. 

Currently Schulze and Hoban 
are seeking support for the idea 
(rom the students and the AS 
Council. 

term that the school could not 
be held responsible for stolen 
property and that personal 
insurance was made available 
to tbe students for their 
protection. 

He also commented that the 
newsletter In question can be 
Interpreted not as a guarantee 
alalnst theft but as a warning 
of the poaslbillty of it occurriDi. 
He feels that the students are 
"bi, boys and lirls" and 
shouldn't bave "followed 
bUndly wbat big brother said." 

Levens said tbat this " very 
unfortunate incident" occurred 
as a result of the dual nature of 
his position as legal advisor to 
both the student body and lbe 
Vice-Chancellor of Student 
Affairs. 

Tbe case was, after lome 
delay; taken over by Robert 
Brown, a San Francisco at-
torney and father of one of the 
students Involved. His firm is 
bandlina the case at no cost to 
the students. 

BonatUl, now a senior at 
UCSD, commented that "It 
isn't the money 10 mucb, I 
pretty mucb kissed that of at 
the time of the burllary . It's lbe 

principle of the whole thing." 
He claims that the resident 
dean was aware that all the 
master keys were not ac-
counted for when she assured 
the students of the safety of 
leaving their belongings. He 
fears that the excessive delay 
in bringing the case to court 
may result in some students 
giving up tbeir attempt at 
compensation after their 
graduation. 

A court date has not yet been 
set but it is anticipated that 
Brown vS. the Regents of the 
University of Califomia will go 
before a jury in municipal court 
at some time next year.

Pregnancy Rate Up -Among Students 
By Dail St. Claire Bacon 

Slalf Wricer 
There have been three times 

more unwanted pregnancies 
this fall at UCSD than In 
previous years. Pregnancies 
which could have been pre· 
vented, according to Sharon 
Keating, director of UCSD's 
Contraceptive Counseling and 
Education Clinic. 

" It's obvious," said Keating, 
"that there's a bunch of people 
out there we' re not reaching." 

Keating emphasized that the 
clinic could have prevented 
those unwanted pregnancies. 
"None of the women that have 
gone through the clinic have 
had unwanted pregnancies," 
she noted. 

According to Keating there 
are f ou r basic methods of 
contraception used at the 
clinic. All methods, if used 
correctly, are over 950/. effec-
tive. 

The first , the Foam and 
CondOn) Method, is the only 
birth control device available 
without a prescription. The 
condom, a rubber sheath, is 

place over the male organ to 
prevent sperm (rom contacting 
the woman 's uterus . The 
purpose of the foam Is to kill the 
sperm. 

The Diaphram, the second 
method, is a domed-shaped 
object that's placed in the 
woman's vaginal canal. It's 
size depends on the woman's 
pelvic size. It must be fitted by 
a trained person. Thediaphram 
is used with spermacide jelly 
which kills the sperm. This 
device can be inserted up to two 
hours before intercourse and 
lasts for over a year depending 
on use. 

The IUD, the third method, is 
a plastic object inserted by a 
trained person in the uterus. 
Depending on the kind of IUD 
it's replaced every one to three 
years . It is not completely 
understood how the IUD works 
but it is generally thought that 
the IUD prevents the egg from 
implanting itself in the uterine 
wall . 

Lastly, the Pill, the most 
popular method of birtb con-
trol. There are several dif-

Consciousness Class 
Offered Here 

Consciousness; being aware 
of your own awareness. The 
nature of human consciousness 
will be explored in a Frontiers 
of Science course offered 
winter quarter entitled " Di-
mensions of Consciousness. " 

The class was developed by 
UCSD students and will strive 
to present the writings -and 
ideas of those thinkers whose 
insights into the behavioral and 
brain sciences have fostered 
new modes of thought, weaving 
a multi-disciplinary coherence 
to a large and diverse body of 
knowledge. The course will 
bring noted authorities from 

IIl8tOlTlleQ 

many disciplines who will 
articulate the proposed data 
base. 

An extensive course reading 
list, a midterm, term paper and 
final will make the workload 
substantial. Prerequisites 
involve only introductory 
biology and a general knowl-
edge of scientific methodology. 
Students from many disciplines 
are encouraged to participate 
as your insights are core to the 
theme of the course. The goal is 
toward a common ground, open 
and receptive. from which new 
thoughts on conscious man can 
emerge.

ferent kinds of pills. One kind is 
prescribed according to the 
woman's body mechanism. The 
pill contains two hormones, 
progestin and estrogen, whose 
presence in the body prevents 
ovulation. The pill should be 
taken at the same time every 
day to provide twenty-four hour 
protection. 

CCEC director Keating 
pointed out the responsibilities 
attached with each birth 
control method. Out of the four, 
the diaphram and the foam and 
condom are used incorrectly 
most often. The foam and jelly 
must be used with their res-
pective devices to be at least 
95% effective. The condom is 
not as effective without the 
foam. The diaphram is not 
effective at all withoutthejelly. 

The IUD has a potential of 
possible slippage rendering in 
ineffective. One must check it 
monthly, according to Keating. 
" The Pill, " said Keating , 
" must be taken systematically. 
If you miss a day your progestin 
and estrogen level drops .

OVUlation is a possibility: ' 
Keating warns women 

against taking someone else's 
birth control pill. "Everyone's 
hormone levelis different. One 
person 's pill might not be 
effective for someone else," 
she said. 

These prescribed birth con-
trol methods are available 
through the clinic. Services are 
available free of charge to UC 
students except for lab fees and 
supplies. 

The clinic sponsors group and 
individual counseling and 
education sessions. Individual 
sessions are by appointment. 
Group sessions are held every 
Tuesday and Wednesday at 12 
in the Student Center Con-
ference Room. No appointment 
is necessary. 

The group sessions include 
what 's involved in a gyno-
cological exam and a pap 
smear, the pros and cons of 
birth control, interpersonal 
relationshiDs and sexuality 

discussions . Questions are 
encouraged. " There's no such 
thing as a silly question," 
Keating said . " Nothing is basic 
or common knowledge. People 
think they should know about 
birth control because they are 
in college. But unless you have 
a real open and knowledgeable 
friend you ' re not going to know. 
Most high schools don 't dis-
pense this information ," she 
said. 

The clinic is a service for 
make and females , sexually 
active or not. Everyone is 
encouraged to drop by for open 
hours, M-F , 8-11 am and 1-4: 30 
pm. You can call to make a 
private appointment at x2669. 
The Clinic is located in the 
Student Health Center. 

"We' re not here to promote 
sex or birth control," Keating 
sympathizes. We don't pass any 
moralistic judgements on 
anyone . " The clinic gives 
information and counseling, 
she said.

Dick Shawn a Comedic Treasure 

By Ted Navin Burke 
Arts EdUor 

Dick Shawn is unique in the 
art of American stand-up 
comedy_ Unlike other yuck-
yuck mongers who employ the 
standard variations on any 

number of recurring themes _ 
higb school days, tales of sexual 
ineptitude , how tough the 
comedian's neighborhood is, 
quaint insights into the stupidi-
ty of people in general, and so 
on - Shawn's repertoire is less 

joke oriented and more con-
ceptual. Shawn's mind has an 
abstract, almost surreal quali-
ty that distinguishes him from 
anyone else in the field. 

There are other comic non-
conformists who've set them-

selves apart by their self-willed loo probing for Shawn's grey 
eccentricity, such as Andy head.

_Yes Out 
In Space 

By Stu Honda 
For the second time in as 

many albums, Yes bas aur· 
prised and puzzled its fana and 
critics by releaalng TormMo, a 
collection of nine sonp. Con-
trary to popular opinion, the 
music by this quintet ia not 
getting any simpler; it ia as 
complex as ever, only more 
accessable. 

Tormato contains the most 
number of songs since Fralile 
and, for once, no song is over 
eight minutes. With Yes ob· 
serving their tenth anniversary 
this year, hidden mesSages 
abound. 

In "Future Times/Release," 
Jon Andersen espouses: " Re-
joice .forward out this feeling / 
Ten tnie summers long/ We go 
round and round ... " Yes fans 
should remember some key 
lines in "Roundabout": "One 
mile over we'll be there and 
we'll see you/ Ten true sum· 
mers we' ll be there and laugh· 
ing too .. . " Possibly a prophecy 
by Anderson come true. 

At many points, Tormato 
sounds like an album for 
experimentation by the group. 
Alan Wbite plays drum syn-
thesizers effectively on " Arriv-
ing UFO" and joins in on the 
vocals on " Release, Release." 
Chris Squire contributes a 
piano part on "Don't Kill The 
Whale , " Yes ' attempt at a 
direct message. Anderson' s 
son, Damion, squeaks out a two 
line part at the end of "Circus of 
Heaven." 

Certain numbers makes one 
wonder what Yes was thinking 
of when they were recording. 
On. " Madrigal," 1 thought my 
SWiss-made Frumkin speakers 
were distorting Rick Wake· 
man ' s synthesizer until I 
realized the instrument was a 
French hom. In addition to 
that, orchestration was used to 
back the group. 

Tormato closes wi th th e 
strongest piece of the album, 
" On The Silent Wings of 
Freedom." 

This album fills the needs of 
any die·ha rd Yes Fan, but ifthe 
group goes a ny (urthe r out into 
space, they may leave some 
morlals behind.

The Latest 
ForShawD 
Phillips Fans 

By Jobn Nadj 
Shawn Phillips reaches the 

epitome of bubble gum like 
Christian music with Trans-
cendence, his latest release. 
Any religious person, young or 
old, will see at once the esoteric 
references to our Saviour 
merely by pickipg up the album 
and scrutinizing the front 
covp.r. 

The music consists chiefly of 
calm, classically tinged music 
(ull . of acoustic guitars, man-
dolin , bass, dFums , piano , 
orchestral arrangements and a 
wa terphone . These Instru-
ments combine to form a sound 
not unlike that of Dan FOKel-
berg ' s Nether Laads. The 
members of Phillips' band can 

~oub.t1essly play their res pec-
tive mstruments with skill and 
dexterity, but they tend to be 
lac king in the origin a lity 
depa rtment. This , in a way , 
makes their music easier to 
Ii te n to , especially if you 
happen to be asleep atthe time.

. Most of the numbers on the 

Parallel Unea is not a bad 
album but a sad album - a 
reminder of what IitUe imagi-
nation is required to seD, and 
also of what little temptation Is 
required to seU out. 

aroup's final album are light 
folk tunes set to a rock and roll 
beat. All are "traditional" 
storytelling-type sonas In the 
typical Britilb manner, tales of 
sailors. ablps, maids, knights 
and othen. 

As to labeling this a "live" 
album, some doubt remaiDa. 

- The -IOUDd II very -clean, too 
clean, in fact, for your basic 
concert recordinJ. Each piece 
could very well have been 
recoMed in a studio filled with 
an audience. Absent Is any type 
of reverb or adUbbing between 
songs to make the listener feel 
as if be were at a concert. 

The classification of this 
music is also questionable . 
While the folk song lyrics and 
melody are present (complete 
with accordian) a definite rock 
and roll sound comes through; 
Electric guitars and a strong 
bass guitar/drum rhythm 
sways each piece toward the 
rock side. Hearing thll record 
makes one think that Steeleye 
Span's music is somewhere 
between folk and rock. 

The album closes with a 
studio remake of "Rag Doll," 
an early sixties hit. It makes for 
an unusual ending for a live 
album, much less the final 
album by the g~up .

Van MO'rrisoD Rocks 
By Barry AJfeMo 

" Shang-alang-alang," said 
Van MorrlaoD in one of bla 
profounder moments oD, the 
excellent SalDt Domlalc'i 
Preview album, released in 
1972. There are few sinters 
alive wbo can capture the sheer 
vitality and swing of rhythm 
and blues/rock the way Mor-
rison at his best can; he doesn' t 
need to make sense. As he putit 
in " Brown Eyed Girl," "Sha-Ia-
la-Iala-la ." With Morrison, the 
medium definitely is the 
message ... . his plaintive, grav· 
elly, delicate voice can convey 
more than most so-called 
" poetic" rock lyrics written 

these days. 
You can bear him in fine form 

on his new Wave"''''' album. 
The sonl's. bere are short, 
enel'letic, very cateby, lyr-
ically simple but rich and 
intricate as music. Morrison is 
possibly rock's finest arranger, 
capable of combining seem-
ingly uncomplimentary musi-
cal styles (baroque strings 
carrying a rlEb tune, twangy 
steel guitar counterpointed 
<lgainst a gospel chorus) and 
making the product work 
brilUanUy. His use of horns and 
background choir has always 
been especially imaginative.

(Coal. from pqe 11) 
Lyrically speaking, the 
wo~s deal with obscure, slice 
of life-type situations which 
seem "to bear no earthly con-
nection. except to those few 
who really go in for this type of 
nonsense. Phillips likes his 
lyrics to rhyme. but unfor-
tunately lbey rhyme all the 
time. What's more Phillips 
Sin,s a. If he were making an 
effort to chant. No. nowhere 
near the like of such mem-
orable chanters such at Yes or 
Geor,e Ha rrisoo , but Instead 
he comes across sounding Ilke a 
cross between a mellow Tull 
and a male Ronstadt. If this 
isn't enough. his voice remindi 
me of Black Oak Arkansas' Jim 
Dandy. 

This blend of mish·mash 
makes the album almost 
intolerable If not unbearable. 

-What it bolls down to can be 
literally stated as. "If It isn't 
one thing, it's another." In 
other word., If the vocals don't 
get you, the waterphone will .

Soccer Team In and Out of Playoffs 
.... o.a 

................... Des"" tM CODfuatoD sur-
roundig it. playoff berth. 
the soc:eer team fIDaJly made It 
to their po.t-.eason ,arne 
Monday. 

Some playen dldn't even 
know tb. team would be 
playlnc until they were notified 
three boun prior to the ,ame. 
They arrived at the field of their 

AlUla at 

3: 30, one bour later than the 
scheduled 2: 30 kickoff time . 
And, for the third time in as 
many yean. the Tritons lOll 
their first round playoff game. 
this Ume HI. 

Pbtying without an adequate 
warmup, UCSD wa. fortunate 
to_ba¥e-"beld the Coutars. who 
devoured the TritoDi 3-1 on 
Halloween. to paly one score. 
"Tbey were really hot Monday. 
Tbey had two players we've 

never seen before and they just 
dominated the play," com-
mented coach Stewart Hayes. 

The defeat marked the eighth 
strai,bt for tbe slumping 

. squad. Once boldini on to a 5-3-1 
record, the final season tally 
dropped to 5-11-1. 

The season was not so bleak 
though. "Even alaiDst loop 
tearna like San Dieso State and 
Chapman. tbougb the score was 
pretty depreulng after the first 

half. they continued to playas 
hard as they could," said 
Hayes. "And they could walk 
off the field proud." 

Another asset holdina the 
team together was its close-
ness. "There was a lot less 
divisiveness this year than last 
year," said Hayes. "You have 
to have that on a team - the 
unselfishness and confidence in 
your teammates." 

other belp came from the 
growing band of spectators 
coming out for their Muir Field 
games, and from statisticians 
Erin Greer, Lisa Dalton. and 
Nancy Stull. 

"I've already started think-
Jng about next year.·' said the 
UCSD coach one day after the 
1978 season ended . Three 

All-Cal Tourney 

seniors, goalie Clay Carley. 
Shah Essapoor, and John 
Kolenda, won't be back in 1979, 
but the rest of tbe roster should 
be returning . . 

Tbe returning players will 
continue playing together on a 
San Diego County League club 
team. and through workouts 
and clinics later in the school 
year. 

Though the Tritons have a 
solid backbone of players. 
Hayes plans on recruiting to 
"get the few key people it will 
take to make the team work. 
Many times we just barely 
stayed in the game. With a little 
more talent, we could have 
swung it." Specifically, with 
the loss of Carley, the team will 
need a couple of goalies. 

Swimmers Fifth 
It·s no wonder that women's 

swim coach Diana Dann is 
proud of her team. Last Satur-
day at the AIl·Cal in Santa 
Barbara every single girl 
improved her time as the 
Tritons finished fifth overall 
against UC competition. 

"We really did well ," ex-
claimed Dann . " Everybody 
bettered their time trial times 
by one to five seconds." UC 
Santa Barbara won the All-Cal. 
beating UC Berkeley by 2 
points. UCSD was fifth. 

Claudia O'Brien broke 1: 00 in 
her anchor leg of the 400 

freestyle relay. With a 33.0 in 
the 50 yard breaststroke Janet 
Parkinson beat the small 
college championship time of 
33.3, swimming her leg in the 
200 year medJey relay. Nadine 
Thompson, a veteran from last 
year's squad, started her 1978 
season in 100 yard butterfly 
with the same time she ended 
with last year. 

In the first dual swim meet of 
the season UCSD faces USD 
this afternoon at 3 at the USD 
pool. Dann hopes to swim all 
her girls in at least [our events.
