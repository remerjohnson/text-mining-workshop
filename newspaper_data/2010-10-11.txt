Chanting slogans such as “Another university is possible” and “They say cut back, we say fight back,” a crowd of about 300 students, faculty and professors gathered on Library Walk 
last Thursday to rally as part of the Oct. 7 Day of Action.

The protest against budget cuts, fee hikes and layoffs is a continu-
ation of the March 4 rallies, which had more than 1,000 participants 
at UCSD alone. 

“The main goal of this protest and rally is to [educate] a lot of 
first-years who are not familiar with the situation or the problems 
that our state is having in not prioritizing their education, and I 
think it’s going to expose them to that reality,” A.S. President Wafa 
Ben Hassine said. 

The rally began with a walkout at 11:30 a.m., after which the pro-
testors met outside Geisel Library to begin marching. The rally then 

moved toward the Chancellor’s Complex, where organizers shared 
personal anecdotes about the effects of the cuts to public education. 
Afterwards, student rappers, speakers and poets addressed the bud-
get cuts through performances in front of Price Center.

At 5 p.m., the rally relocated to Balboa Park in San Diego to meet 
with protesters from San Diego State University, community colleges 
and some K-12 public schools. Similar rallies occurred in universi-
ties around the state, as well as universities like the University of 
Wisconsin-Milwaukee. Overall, 26 different states nationwide had 
schools that participated in the rally.

UCSD Coalition for Education Justice organizer Josue Castellon 
said the different circumstances leading up to the March 4 and Oct. 
7 rallies must be taken into consideration when judging the protest’s 
success.

“For the March 4 rally, we had a lot of time,” Castellon said. “The

The UCSD Housing, Dining, and Hospitality 
Department  implemented a compost system in 
August to cut waste from dining facilities.

Last year, dining hall food waste could not be 
composted because there was no permanent on-
campus composting facility and — because of the 
budget cuts —   UCSD could not outsource the 
task. However, HDH representatives began com-
munication with the city about the new program 
last year.

HDH  has been working since August 2010 
with the City of San Diego Food Scrap Recycling 
program to compost more of the university’s 
waste on a weekly basis.

In the new program, the food scraps are col-
lected each weekday from dining hall kitchens 
and put into a compactor.  The compacter is then 
emptied once a week at the Miramar Landfill 
Greenery section, where they are broken down 
into marketable fertilizer to be sold.  UCSD does 
not receive any of the revenue.

The program will save the university about 
$30 per ton of disposals by composting food 
scraps instead of dumping them into a landfill, 
according to Housing and Dining Sustainability 
Manager Krista Mays. 

“We think that by [having] the food scrap 
recycling program, we can divert about 53 per-
cent of our waste from dining halls,” Mays said.

This waste percentage is based on the average 
three million meals served by HDH each year and 

the industry standard of 0.3 pounds wasted food 
per meal served.

In the seven weeks between the program’s 
start  in August and Sept. 23, HDH composted 
over 15 tons of food scraps.  Within the first week 
of school, they were able to compost 4.3 tons.

Currently, the program only extends to the 
food scraps from HDH dining venues, such as 
the dining hall kitchens and their catering ser-
vice.   Most of the waste produced here comes 
from food scraps left over after preparation of 
meals.  

A major concern to the composting program 
is contamination of the compostable materials 
with non-compostable plastics and metals.

After a record-setting 100 days of 
conflict over how to close California’s 
$19-billion deficit, state legislatures 
passed the 2010-11 fiscal year bud-
get — including a plan that gives a 
one-time restoration of $305 million 
that was cut from the University of 
California system last year.

Last Friday, Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger signed an $86.6 bil-
lion spending plan, which gives $5.5 
billion each to the UC and California 
State University systems. This is $250 
million more than last year.

“While [the UC system] welcomes 
the funding restorations contained 
in the state budget, the university 
still faces significant challenges,” 
UC Vice President for Budget and 
Capital Resources Patrick Lenz said 
in a statement.

Despite increased funding, per-
manent state support for the UC sys-
tem is still 10 percent below the level 
provided during the 2007-08 aca-
demic year. Since then, 16,000 more 
California residents have enrolled in

“It is what we expected,” UC 

spokesperson Ricardo Vasquez said. 
“We are thankful to the governor 
and the legislature for making high-
er education a priority, even as the 
state continues to face fiscal chal-
lenges.”

In addition, $5.8 billion has been 
allocated for the California commu-
nity college system, which is about 
$108 million more than last year. 
However, $189 million of that will 
be deferred to the next fiscal year.

In the overall state budget, there 
is a $1-billion spending increase 
from last year due to an additional 
revenue of $5.4 billion from the 
federal government. About $1.3 bil-
lion of the federal revenue has been 
approved by Congress and President 
Barack Obama.

In the $305-million restora-
tion to the UC system, $106 mil-
lion comes from federal American 
Recovery and Reinvestment Act 
funding and $199 million comes 
from the state’s general fund.

In addition, the budget includes 
about $51.3 million that will pro-
vide financial assistance for 5,121 
of 16,000 high school students who 
are not currently funded by the 
state.   About $14.1 million is allo-
cated for increases in health care 
costs for the UC system’s pension-
ers.

The budget also provides $353 
million for construction projects 
that will improve earthquake safety 
and student access.

Lenz also said the budget will 
allow the UC system to hire new 
faculty members and restore course 
offerings and student services.

In July, UCSD announced that it 
will be searching for 40 new faculty 
members during the 2010-11 year.

“The budget cuts for 2010-11 
appear to be slightly smaller than 
expected,” Senior Vice Chancellor 
of Academic Affairs Paul Drake said 
in an e-mail. “For the fiscal year 
2009-10, no new faculty searches 
were authorized due to budget con-

[racist] events that occurred also 
caused more people to show up. We 
had a lot of support, and about four 
months of time to prepare. [With 
only] two weeks to prepare for the 
Oct. 7 rally, I think having 300 stu-
dents show up is a great success.” 

At UCSD, a petition — now 
hanging at the Cross Cultural Center —was passed around demanding an 
open debate with administration to 
discuss fee hikes. 

According to Castellon and 
speakers at the rally, the objective 
was not only to get the attention of 
the administration but also to edu-
cate the thousands of students and 
faculty on campus that didn’t show 
up at the rally about how the budget 
cuts affect them and others in the 
community. 

Physics professor Adam Burgasser 
participated in the rally to discuss 
the necessity of making higher edu-
cation more accessible to minorities.

“It frustrates me,” Burgasser said. 
“All the effort put into [giving] these 
students an education … and get a 

degree and then they are priced out 
of it.”

Burgasser said he is trying to 
diversify the faculty. 

“I’m working on...identifying 
physics faculty of color that will 
come here and encourage students 
of color to come here and pursue the 
sciences, and we are having trouble 
with that,” he said. 

Meanwhile, many students, 
though  aware of the rally, chose not 
to attend. Marshall College junior 
Jay Patel said that the rally was not 
publicized in a manner to make the 
cause evident. 

“I felt that their argument was 
too broad, that they were trying to 
address too many issues — environ-
mentalism, tuition increases, racism, 
the Afghanistan war — they don’t 
really have anything in common in 
my eyes, [so] there is no real point to 
going to a rally where there is going 
to be people addressing so many dif-
ferent issues,” Patel said.

This means students’ food scraps 
are not being composted because 
of the worry that students will not 
know what to compost and what to 
throw away.

To stay part of San Diego’s food 
composting program, the compost 
material that comes in to the center 
must contain less than 1 percent 
contaminants.  If this requirement is 
not consistently met, HDH cannot 
participate in the program. 

Since it is not feasible to examine 
every single bag of food scraps for 
contaminants, in order for HDH to 
compost students’ waste, the depart-
ment heavily relies on students to 
place food scraps in the proper con-
tainers.

“We’ll be working on different 
ways of educating students, whether 
it’s with YouTube videos or articles 
or whatever it is, to try to get people 
to understand what we’re doing and 

why we’re doing it,” Mays said.  
To help students properly com-

post, HDH has relabeled the com-
post bins as “food scrap” bins.

“We believe that ‘food scraps’ is a 
pretty understandable thing,” Mays 
said.  “You know what packaging is, 
you know what food is. And if it’s 
not food, don’t put it in [the food 
scraps bin]. The easy part about the 
program is it’s all food — any food 
scraps — so it [includes] bones, 
meats, skin [and] egg shells.”

According to Mays, the transi-
tion into collecting the post-con-
sumer food scraps will be a slow 
one.  

She said the plan is to start with 
one dining facility’s post-consumer 
scraps and progress until all of the 
dining halls can reliably produce 
contaminant-free compost.

straints. This is a rebound from one 
of the worst hiring periods in the 
school’s history.”

Drake said that last year, no new 
faculty searches took place because 
the university cut $85 million in 
expenses to balance the state budget.

“The crunch resulted in the 
general campus hiring only seven 
faculty [members],” Drake said. “A 
year earlier, about 50 new profes-
sors joined UC San Diego’s general 
campus.”

Drake said the job searches will 
not provide UCSD with enough 
new faculty members to replace the 
number of people who have left, 
retired or not achieved tenure.

“We’d love to get back to our pre-
vious hiring rate; we’ve been a grow-
ing campus,” Drake said. “Levels of 
state funding have been declining. 
Over the next 10 years, the size of 
the faculty on the main campus 
could decline by about one-fourth, 
or about 660 [people].”

Due to the setback in approving 
the budget, students’ financial aid 
payments were delayed and the UC 
system borrowed about $400 mil-
lion to fund Cal Grants and operat-
ing costs. The university will have 
to pay interest on the money it 
borrowed.

OUT OF CONTEXT
The ironic part is, if you ate too many 
Double Downs, you wouldn’t fit in the 
sweatpants they are handing out to those 
girls with their cute little butts.”

KIRAN CHETRY
CNN American Morning, Anchor

“
DonÕtÊLaughÊ
NowÊÑÊSomeÊ
RulesÊAreÊMeantÊ
toÊbeÊBroken

A few weeks ago, I was on the phone with my brother when he told me something shock-
ing: It’s boring when girls always laugh 
at guys’ jokes. 

Don’t laugh, this was a new con-
cept for me.

From the moment I figured out 
what flirting was for, I was taught that 
you should laugh at even a guy’s lam-
est attempts at humor. To see if other 
girls thought the same, I polled the 
ladies at UCSD — or at least the 50 
who weren’t fast enough to avoid me 
waiting with a clip board — asking if 
they laugh at a guy’s jokes more, the 
same, or less if they liked him. 

Of the girls who weren’t rushing to 
class or blatantly avoiding eye contact, 
32 said they laugh more when they 
are interested in a guy, while 15 said 
they laughed the same amount and 
two laughed less. 

I decided to experiment. Last 
week, my friends found ourselves 
on I-Walk. Just as we were about to 
declare this Friday night a failure and 
take our glammed-up selves back 
to the dorms, we bumped into hot 
foreign boys carrying several boxes of 
pies. We asked them what they were 
doing, partly because they were cute, 
partly because we wanted free dessert. 

One of the guys launched into 
a story of how his employer had 
ordered 16 key lime pies by mistake; a 
mix-up that resulted in him challeng-
ing the Marie Callender’s delivery boy 
to a parking lot fight. 

Mid-giggle, I remembered what 
my brother said about girls laugh-
ing. As my friends continued to 
laugh, I did my best impression of a 
Buckingham Palace guard. I noticed 
one boy’s eyes subtly start to dart in 
my direction, growing aware of my 
lack of reaction. 

Later, he approached me and we 
spent the night talking. Apparently, 
something stood out about me, since 
the only time I spoke that night was 
when I announced that my cat is the 
Mork to my Mindy (a sci-fi reference 
from the 1980s). I can’t help but think 
that this flirting success is at least par-
tially due to my brother’s advice. 

I stepped back onto Library Walk, 
this time asking the men of UCSD 
whether they found girls more attrac-
tive if they laughed at their jokes. Of 
the guys I asked, 70 percent said that 
they would be more interested in a 
girl if she laughed at his jokes. That 
leaves 30 percent of guys who found 
that laughing at all their jokes is a 
turn-off. “I tell horrible jokes,” one 
guy admitted. “If a girl laughs at all of 
them, there’s something wrong with 
her!”

It seems that the “laugh at his 
every word” rule is meant to be flex-
ible. Do your own experiments; see 
how guys react. It’s natural to want 
him to like you, but don’t sacrifice 
your personality. If you don’t typi-
cally laugh easily, don’t force it (if you 
do end up dating him, you’ll have to 
continue laughing at his jokes — no 
matter how pathetic they are). 

Don’t be afraid to defy what other 
girls are doing. In a school with 
this many people, you can afford to 
embarrass yourself from time to time. 
Take that risk: You might even get 
some free pie.

HIGHER EDUCATION — Regardless of wheth-
er you’re a diligent scholar who never missed a 
lecture or a slacker who skims the SparkNotes 
the morning of the exam, finals week is a lonely 
party shared with books and rounds of espresso 
shots. The thought that one 3-hour exam could 
override 10 weeks of hard work (or a lack there-
of) is a universal nightmare. 

Now imagine a world in which every quarter 
didn’t culminate in a three-hour stay hell. Well, 
saddle up, because that idyllic world might not 
be as far away as we think. 

Harvard College made headlines when it 
changed its policy to assume that professors 
would not be issuing a final exam, requiring that 

they sign a waiver if they wanted one. Though 
Harvard is the most prominent abandoner of 
finals it’s not the only institution to make this 
change; finals are disappearing across many 
undergraduate campuses. And though most of 
us are probably not lucky enough to have experi-
enced a final-less finals week, some UCSD pro-
fessors — from the math to the lit departments 
— no longer have sit-down finals. 

According to Jay M. Harris, dean of under-
graduate education at Harvard College, only 
259 out of 1,137 undergraduate courses sched-
uled final exams during their spring semester 
last year. These nerve-racking tests of will are 
replaced by papers, presentations and projects.

Educators are finally considering that finals 
aren’t necessarily the best way to ensure that 
students are learning the material. And let’s be

KFC’s objective is to sell some bunless burg-
ers, not to lead a feminist movement. With 
the company’s brand awareness down, KFC is 
having a go at an old and proven strategy: the 
female form.

With this campaign, KFC is looking to 
reach its 18- to 25-year-old demographic, many 
of whom are girls who already find it cute to 
wear brands such as “Juicy” or “Pink” across 
their buns. Other companies have been taking 
advantage of this fact for years; KFC is simply 
embracing the practice of writing on the back-
side of women’s apparel. 

If KFC were putting “double down” on men’s 
behinds, no one would care — though the 
chain would probably be ridiculed for launch-
ing such an ineffective campaign.

KFC’s advertisers had the right idea about 
men when they figured that the best way to 
make a guy read something is to write it on a 
girl’s behind. The average American is exposed 
to over 3,000 advertisements a day, and KFC is 
just trying to stand out from the rest.

Marketing is all about attempting to break 
through the pack and increasing name recog-
nition, and the Double Down is getting more 
attention than any other sandwich. Whether it 
is good press or bad press, people know about 
the Double Down, and that makes KFC pretty 
damn successful.

Though college women can do what they 
choose with their bodies — including proudly 
declaring their butts “Juicy”— using them as a 
billboard to appeal to young men is still prob-
lematic. 

The $500 paycheck KFC is offering college 
girls just to wear the words “double down” 
across their butts may be hard to pass up, but 
it still counts as exploitation. 

KFC executives are clearly taking advan-
tage of the fact that most college co-eds are 
strapped for cash and would not turn down 
easy money. 

They get a profiteering twofer: not only are 
they playing to the financial needs of students, 
but they’re doing so in a way that blatantly 
objectifies women.  

By advertising their products in this way, 
KFC is essentially using women — and their 
butts — as merchandise, encouraging cus-
tomers to openly oogle in the name of brand 
recognition. 

This would be different if both male and 
female students were hired to wear advertis-
ing slogans across their butts, but KFC is only 
recruiting females. 

Just what we need: more confirmation that 
women are worth little beyond their ability to 
get men to reach for their wallets.

Six months ago, KFC unveiled its newest heart attack in a wrapper: the Double Down 
Sandwich. This crime against reasonable dietary 
restrictions replaces sandwich buns with two 
fried chicken breasts, wrapped around melted 
slices of cheese, crisp bacon and “special sauce.” 
Now, in an attempt to capture the demographic 
of 18- to 25-year-old men, KFC started paying 
cute co-eds $500 to wear sweatpants with the 
words “Double Down” upon their buns. Because 
the sandwich doesn’t have buns. Brilliant.

Of course, there are the requisite angry 
feminists from the National Organization for 
Women who are protesting the ad campaign’s 
outright objectification of women. Who cares? 
If this is selling out, girls must have prostituted 
themselves a long time ago by buying “PINK” 
sweatpants. Back then, we were the ones shelling 
out money to use our butts as walking advertise-
ments, so how is getting paid to do exactly the 
same thing any different? Or any worse?  If you 
paid me $500 to pass out flyers while wearing 
sweatpants, you could print whatever the hell 
you want on my butt. 

Even though the Double Down is a 
Frankenstein creation straight out of the pages of 
ThisIsWhyYouAreFat.com, KFC can call me to 
advertise for them any day.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Ivy Precedent Means We Might be Finished With Finals
academic developments becoming less 
theoretical and more dependent on 
real-life simulations, canceling finals 
week will only become more promi-
nent nationwide.

There’s no longer a need to memo-
rize complicated political theories 
when search engines are readily avail-
able. Harvard professors are finding 
that this new level of information 
overload across disciplines cannot be 
tested in a single sitting. 

Finals don’t quantify students’ 
ability to retain material. More often, 
they test our regurgitation abilities, or 
how much caffeine we can take before 
entering a state of delirium. 

A 1991 study by Professor of 
Education Herbert J. Walbert at the 
University of Chicago found that take-
home papers, presentations or projects 
are far better ways of gauging a stu-
dent’s ability, and ultimately produce 
more thoughtful work. The only ele-
ment missing from these methods of 
examining students is the element of 

surprise. But while we all love surprise 
birthday parties, realizing that a third 
of your final concerns something you 
skimmed back in Week One is a nasty 
shock that doesn’t accurately gauge 
what we’ve learned over the quarter. 
Assiduous students can still dem-
onstrate their understanding of the 
material, their engagement in lecture 
and their analysis of the texts, without 
the stress of time constraints and an 
Adderall hangover. Without finals, 
forgetting where some obscure war 
took place will no longer be the factor 
that flushes your GPA down the toilet. 

This isn’t to say that there should 
be a blanket abolition of finals for 
every subject. For some subjects such 
as math, there is no better way to 
test a student’s competence with the 
key skills of quantitative reasoning. 
Similarly, introductory classes may 
be more fact-based and require a 
greater level of memorization, but as 
students move beyond the basics and 
gradually adapt more research-based 
approaches, final exams become too 

rigid to legitimately encompass a stu-
dent’s critical thinking and analytical 
ability.  

Educators need to understand 
that the ways we learn are changing, 
and the methods of examining what a 
student has learned or gained from a 
class should change too. It’s foolish to 
keep archaic methods of examination. 
If we understand the influences of 
technology on our world, and espe-
cially on education, the methods of 
testing understanding and cognitive 
reasoning have to change as well. 

Perhaps, if UCSD followed in 
Harvard’s footsteps, CLICS would 
look less like the Coachella camp-
grounds during finals week and 
students would stop doing their best 
impressions of mechanical toys. And 
who knows? Without finals, UCSD 
might even be able to ditch that 
“socially dead” stigma.

Dear Editor,
Last Tuesday, Oct. 5, Tritons for 

Israel and CAMERA (Committee for 
Accuracy in Middle East Reporting 
in America) brought Bedouin-Israeli 
diplomat Ishmael Khaldi to share his 
personal account of his journey from 
being a Bedouin shepherd in north-
ern Israel to becoming the world’s 
first Bedouin-Israeli diplomat. 

He spoke to a mixed crowd of 
students and faculty, both Jews and 
non-Jews, about the status of peace 
negotiations between Israel’s Prime 
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and 
Palestinian Authority President 
Mahmoud Abbas. 

Khaldi began by telling his story 
of living in Israel as a Muslim-
Bedouin. Although he embodies 
a mixture of multiple cultures, he 
proudly stated, “I’m Israeli above 
anything.”

Bedouins are desert nomads that 
belong to a tribal society. They are 
known for their gracious hospitality 
and strong commitments to their 
fellow tribesmen and outside guests. 
Bedouins are also Muslims by reli-
gion and are members of the Arab 
world. 

Today, Bedouins are a part of the 
Israeli-Arab minority group, which 
makes up 20 percent of the Israeli 
population. As the Bedouin commu-
nity still observes its traditional life-
style, Israel is contributing to their 
gradual transition into modernity by 
embracing diversity in the state. 

In his book “A Shepherd’s 
Journey,” Khaldi writes, “Bedouin 
tradition makes no differentiation 
between people — all are equal 
regardless of their social status.” 
Israel shares these values and grants 
equal opportunities to all its citizens, 
regardless of skin color, religion or 
background, acting as the vehicle 
that brought Khaldi to success. 
Khaldi’s story represents Israel — a 
thriving multicultural and multilin-
gual society that embodies freedom, 
equality and democracy. 

One of the key messages the 
audience left with that evening 
was of Israel’s unique moral values, 
which bring people from the river, 
desert, mountains and sea together 
into a democratic, diverse and open 
society. 

This diversity is epitomized by 
the fact that a Bedouin-Arab-Israeli-
Muslim is a diplomat representing 
the Jewish state of Israel in the inter-
national community. This fact alone 
demonstrates that the Israeli society 
is not just for Jews, but for all cul-
tures and religions. Khaldi is a vital 
part of that society.

While few things in life are fair or easy, students have come to expect that a grade, at the very least, reflects the 
quality of work put into a course. Not seemingly 
so with grade quotas — a policy where only a cer-
tain percentage of students can get an A, and the 
remainder are boxed into the B and C category. 

These numbers are determined by professors 
prior to reading or grading any students’ work— 
setting up numerous students to get grades 
lower than they would have expected, in order 
to curb grade inflation. Not to be confused with 
a grade curve, where outlying grades scored by 
students are dropped often to positive effect, 
grade quotas set a cap on high scores before the 
course begins. 

For example, if a course only allows for 10 
students to receive an A, students have to compete 
for those 10 slots. If 15 students’ work merits an 
A percentage-wise, only 10 will receive one. The 
other five get Bs.

At UCSD, the Academic Senate is responsible 
for handling grade distribution.  However, none 
of its policies directly address grading curves or 
quotas.  

Mark Appelbaum, chair of Committee on 
Educational Policies in the Academic Senate, 
explained that while there are school-wide 
grading policies, the method used to deter-
mine grades and the school’s grade policies 
aren’t mutually exclusive — educators are 
given the freedom to decide how to mark 
their courses. 

“The distribution of grades is a mat-
ter that individual faculty decide so that 
‘my grading policy is my own policy,’” 
Appelbaum said. “Usually there’s some 
sort of general rule or idea about grades 
that may be in departments.” 

The university gives its fac-
ulty the freedom of choosing 
the grading method for each 
class. Though Appelbaum 

did not know that the policy of grade quotas 
was common amongst faculty, and had yet to 
encounter a professor who put it into practice, he 
explained that it was a professor’s personal choice 
to use quotas.

 “It’s my responsibility to teach 
the content of the course, how I do it 
is part of my professional judgment,” 
Appelbaum said.

Lisa Lowe, a professor of litera-
ture and Critical Gender Studies, 
said a grade quota system would not 
work well for her writing courses. 

 “It doesn’t make sense to me in 
teaching literature,” Lowe said. “In 
general, when I grade a literature 
student’s performance, I evaluate 
the student’s ability to read closely, 
interpret and think analytically, as 
well as the quality of their written 
and oral expression.   I grade stu-
dents on the quality of their own 
individual performances.”  

 Kristopher Nelson, a social sci-
ence T.A., used grade quotas when 
evaluating students in a contempo-
rary law course taught by Professor 
Gerald Doppelt. Nelson said Doppelt 
felt that the students should earn 
their grades and the grade policy of the class was 

not set in stone and allowed T.A.s 
to award more As 

if they deemed it as necessary . The professor 
allowed the T.A.’s to grade with more flexibility 
and the amount of As allowed expanded as the 
quarter wore on.

 “It’s a sense of countering grade inflation, 

when people who got As actually deserved the 
As,” Nelson said. 

Princeton agrees. Six years ago, the Ivy League 
university aimed to reduce grade inflation by set-
ting a maximum number of As that students could 
receive, encouraging students to compete for the 
elusive higher marks. According to the New York 
Times, the move has been an unpopular one, espe-
cially with such a competitive economy — lower 
grades reduce the chance of being hired, and it 
seems graduate schools and employers seldom 
factor in grade deflation. 

Princeton’s administrators have been 
working to remedy the issue by sending out 
notifications about the grade deflation to 
graduate schools and employers. 

But here, the grading policy isn’t the 
same across the board, so schools have

Frequented by beach bums and small families alike, 
Board and Brew is a an obsession among locals and a classic 
trademark of San Diego. Located on Camino Del Mar, about 
a 15-minute drive from UCSD, the small sandwich shop 
doesn’t instantly stand out. The front of the shop sports the 
same simple brown wood exterior as all the buildings on 
Camino Del Mar, but a pastel-colored sign points the way 
to hoagie heaven.

From the giant surfboard on the wall to the aroma of 
fresh bread wafting from the kitchen, this shop’s laidback 
atmosphere creates a relaxed (though ravenous) state of 
mind. The front countertop is worn from years of hold-

ing serving trays, and the wall 
behind the register is coated in 
board shop stickers, local sports 
team posters and ads for surf les-
sons. The restaurant has indoor seating for 
about 15 only, but two shady outdoor seating sections can 
accommodate a larger crowd. 

With incredibly generous portions and high-quality 
ingredients that (thankfully) don’t look like they have been 
sitting out all day, this place beats out the local Subway and 
any on-campus dining halls. Their top-secret sweet-and-
sour special sauce is perhaps one of the best food discoveries 
of my life. This sticky orange sauce, with the consistency of 
salad dressing, is locally famous and can be ordered with 
anything on the menu. If only Board and Brew took dining 
dollars  — I would be eating there daily, trying to smuggle 
special sauce back to my apartment.

The most popular items on the menu are the Turkado 
cold sandwich and the chicken club, hot from the grill. I 
got the Turkado, which consists of turkey and jack cheese 
topped with avocado, tomatoes, lettuce, onion and mayo 
on sourdough bread, but the chicken club is probably my 
favorite, with marinated chicken breast, bacon, melted 
jack cheese, tomato, lettuce and mayo on a toasted French 
baguette. 

Board and Brew has reasonable prices — the most expen-
sive sandwich is $6.95 including sales tax — and all sand-

wiches come stuffed full of goodness. 
Try to get there in the cooler months — during the summer 
it’s packed with locals and trying to find a seat— it’s akin 
to trying to locate your keys in a pile of dirty laundry. And 
if you’re traveling by car, expect to spend time looking for 
street parking that is almost nonexistent during rush hour. 

Fortunately, patrons can text in their order ahead of time 
and pick it up when it’s done. Text that you want a large Baja 
Chicken (marinated chicken breast, grilled onions, jalap-
enos, melted jack cheese, mayo, tomato, lettuce and special 
sauce on toasted French baguette), receive a confirmation 
text, pick up the sandwich and head to the beach.

Board and Brew’s location is perfect for grabbing lunch 
and walking a few hundred feet down to the beautiful Del 
Mar surf for a classic San Diego study break. So check it 
out — and don’t bother asking for the special sauce recipe, 
because they don’t give it out. I already tried.

INFOCUS STEVE MARTIN & THE STEEP CANYON RANGERS

Funny-man-turned-bluegrass-musician Steve Martin, and his band, the Steep Canyon Rangers, performed at the 
Balboa Theatre on Saturday, Oct. 9. Martin, 
best known for his comedic sketches, is sur-
prisingly genuine with a banjo — so genuine 
that his debut compilation of original music, 
The Crow: New Songs for the Five-String Banjo, 
won the 2010 Grammy for Best Bluegrass 
Album.  
The evening featured tracks from The 
Crow’s predominantly instrumental songs. 

Martin’s aptitude with the banjo (especially 
live) impressed bluegrass veterans and  new-
comers, continually garnering praise from crit-
ics. Some notable ditties from his live set were 
the upbeat “Wally on the Run,” the humorously 
twangy “Rare Bird Alert” (from the soundtrack 
of Martin’s upcoming �lm, “The Big Year”) and 
the serenely Celtic “Calico Train.” Though the 
evening had a distinctly mature atmosphere 
— most audience members were well into 
their 30s and dressed to the nines — Martin’s 
running gags lightened the mood.  He stored 

beer inside bass player Charles Humphrey’s 
instrument, tweeted on stage from his iPad 
and compared his love of the banjo to Jerry 
Seinfeld taking up the bazooka. But it was the 
combination of the banjo and Martin’s run-
ning commentary between songs that made 
his two-hour foray into bluegrass worthwhile. 
To listeners’ delight, rather than treating the 
show as a strictly musical endeavor, Martin 
saw it as just another opportunity to entertain.

Students and 
Professors Debate 
the Legitimacy of  
Grade Quotas 
▶ GRADES, fromÊpageÊ6
not notified potential employers and 
graduate schools.  At UCSD, the 
average under graduate GPA sits 
around a 3.0. When some professors 
chose to implement grade deflation 
policies at random, it drops this 
already-low average.

Nelson understood why so many 
students were frustrated with a sys-
tem that seemed arbitrary, but said 
that the results often panned out in 
the end.  

“I don’t think it’s just due to 
chance,” Nelson said, “People pretty 
much ended up similar to how I 
would have given them grades with-
out that restriction.” 

As a result of the quota, more 
students came to Nelson’s office 
hours to discuss their grades and 
to understand the course content 
better. The competition between 
students helped motivate them to 
out-study their classmates. 

Nelson said that the quotas build 
character and a competitive spirit 
among students. 

“It did encourage people to work 
harder, they knew they had to actu-
ally work to get an A,” he said. 

He added, “it can be beneficial in 
the sense that people worked harder 
and maybe learned more.”

For UCSD students, the jury is 
still out on whether grade quotas 
are a good thing. For many students 
in Doppelt’s course, the negatives 
outweighed the benefits.

“It’s totally unfair,” Amy Gains* 
said,  “If I had known that this 
class had grade quotas, I would have 
dropped it. Now I’m stuck.” 

In her case, the LAWS 101 course 
syllabus did not mention that the 
professor would use quotas.  As 
students were graded, T.A.s realized 
they had awarded too many high 
marks and erased original grades 
from papers or exams, replacing 
them with a lower, less satisfactory 
grades.

Sophie Rosseel, an Eleanor 
Roosevelt College sophomore, took 
a physics course which used quotas 
and agrees with Doppelt’s students.

 “Professors should grade stu-
dents based on how well they under-
stand the material rather than mold 
the grades to fit certain quotas,” 
she said. “My main problem with 
them is that in a class full of high-
achieving students, someone still 
has to fill the lower quota; it’s unfair 
to the students.”

Still, a number of students 
expressed favorable opinions on 
grade quotas. Kaitlyn Keigharn, a 
Muir College senior, has taken sev-
eral classes that implement grade 
quota policies, all of which were 
offered by UCSD’s science depart-
ment. 

“I felt that it actually encouraged 
students to work harder,” she said.

Though the controversy is unlike-
ly to die down soon, especially dur-
ing the current economic depression, 
Appelbaum provides UCSD students 
with a simple solution — ask your 
professors if they utilize grade quo-
tas. Though the quota policy isn’t 
prohibited, those who find it limiting 
could always drop the course and try 
re-enrolling under another professor 
at a later date.

  “I think as long as you know in 
advance, so that when you go into 
that course that you know that this 
is going to be a curved course and 
that you know that 15 percent of

WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG/SPORTSMONDAY, OCTOBER 11, 201011 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

By Hanna Rahimi
Staff Writer

The men’s water polo team took a hit with a loss 
to No. 8 Long Beach State on Friday, dropping a 
close match 6-5. The 49ers took an early one-goal 
lead two minutes into the game, and never trailed 
to take the victory.

Sophomore utility Brian Donohoe scored two 
goals, junior goalie David Morton had nine saves 
and the Tritons rallied late, but it was not enough 
to give the No. 9 Tritons the victory.

“It was a big opportunity for us to move up in 
rankings,” Donohoe said. “They are a physical team 
and we came out and let them push us around a 
little bit; [it] took us a while to get adjusted. We 
made some mistakes and didn’t really capitalize on 
our opportunities.”

LBSU’s Patrick van der Linde put the first goal 
on the scoreboard with a shot to the upper left 
corner just within the goal. Following a tense rally, 
UCSD’s senior driver Ryan Allred evened up the 
score just before the close of the first quarter as the 
49ers recovered from an ejection. 

The second quarter opened with the 49ers 
quickly breaking the tie, as Morton stopped a fast 
shot by van der Linde at the line, only to see it 
bounce into the goal.     

Donohoe found the back of the net with a long 
shot that brought the teams to a tie once again, but 
LBSU pushed back 19 seconds later; Carter Taylor 
got in a close shot that closed the third quarter with 
the scoreboard showing 3-2 in favor of the 49ers. 

“We just missed too many shots,” UCSD senior 
driver Bryce Madsen said. “We just didn’t swim 
hard enough to get them tired, that was the biggest 
issue.” 

The second half of the game progressed with 
the Tritons still playing catch-up to the 49ers. The 
third quarter saw another goal by LBSU’s Taylor, 
followed by a score by UCSD’s sophomore utility 
John Butler with barely 2 minutes on the clock. 

“[It was] frustrating to get that momentum and 
then be killed,” Madsen said.

The 49ers came into the fourth quarter deter-
mined to break away from the one-goal difference, 
and Alexsandr Petrovic and Nick Rascon each 
scored within a minute to bring the score to 6-3. 

“[At] the beginning of the fourth quarter, they 
came out and scored two quick goals off of kind 
of iffy turnovers — iffy calls on the offensive end 
for us — but that put us down 6-3,” Donohoe said. 
“It was such a low scoring game, it put us in a bad 
position.”

The Tritons were able to rally, and with 1:29 left 
in the game, Donohoe scored another goal for the 
Tritons to bring the score to 6-5. Despite regaining 
possession with 45 seconds to go thanks to a sound 
stop by Morton, an offensive turnover marked the 
loss of the ball and the end of the competition.  

“We scored a couple, we gave ourselves a 
chance, but in the end it was just too little, too late,” 
Donohoe said.

Donohoe emphasized that the 49ers’ game plan 
forced the Tritons to get away from their usual 
strategy.

“I think the biggest thing is that they [Cal State 

Long Beach] play a very static style of game — 
not much movement,” Donohoe said. “They rely 
on being stronger than other teams and what we 
should have done is a lot more swimming and 
movement. But we played into their style, which 
isn’t best suited for us.”

The Tritons will soon face UC Davis and Santa 
Clara University in away games next weekend. 
Donohoe said the team hopes to get back to the tac-
tics that propelled them to big wins last weekend.

“At the SoCal tournament, we had some big, big 
wins over LMU and Pepperdine,” Donohoe said. 
“The reason we got those wins is we were swim-
ming and counter-attacking better than we had all 
season. We kind of took a step back against Long 
Beach in that area, so we’re just going to try to get 
back to that high tempo, counter-attacking, oppor-
tunistic type of offense.”

The team will be back at Canyonview Pool Oct. 
23 at 2 p.m. to play Loyola Marymount University.

Lenehan credited his teammates 
with his good result, but said that the 
team result takes precedence over 
individual achievement.

“I think I did pretty well,” 
Lenehan said. “It’s all about getting 
help from the teammates… Ideally, 
we would have beat Pomona and 
[gotten] the team win. That’s the 
most important thing, but I’m pretty 
pleased.”

Aaryn Kobayashi led the way on 
the women’s side, coming in at 23:37 
over the 6k course to take 12th place. 
Jackie Sikkema followed closely at 
23:42, who finished 14th overall.

“Aaryn had a real nice race today,” 
Garcia said. “It was a good bounce-
back for her as well, after a couple of 
races she wasn’t happy with.”

The Triton women finished in 

fourth place out of the 11 teams in 
the event, scoring 111 points. Cal 
Poly Pomona swept the meet by tak-
ing the women’s title as well, tallying 
54 points. 

Violah Lagat — the younger sis-
ter of U.S. Olympian Bernard Lagat 
— of Central Arizona won the indi-
vidual title with a time of 22:08. 
Henry Lelei of Central Arizona was 
the top individual men’s finisher, 
coming in with a time of 30:22.

The Tritons now have two 
weeks to prepare for the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association’s pre-
view meet on Saturday, Oct. 23. The 
race will take place on Cal Poly 
Pomona’s home course in South El 
Monte, Calif.

first set. In a tense second game, 
the Tritons were able to score three 
straight points near the end set, tak-
ing the game to avoid going down 
2-0. The Tritons began to take over 
in the third set — scoring six of the 
last seven points in the set — and 
were completely dominant in the 
fourth, taking an early lead and 
maintaining it to win the game and 
the match.

UCSD improved to 8-7 overall 
and 5-6 in the CCAA. The Tritons 
have won three of the last four 
matches after a five-game losing 
streak. However, the wins have all 

been at home, while four of the 
five losses in the losing streak were 
on the road. The Tritons now face 
their first road trip since the skid 
this weekend.

“I think we are still struggling 
at times,” Luyties said. “We have 
a tendency to give up streaks of 
points that kill us. With time, I 
think we’ll get through those humps 
and keep our momentum going. 
I think that will be the difference 
between cruising through games 
and struggling through games like 
we have been.”

Getting back on the winning 
side has helped, and Condon said 
she feels confident going into the 

road trip.
“We’ve beaten Sonoma and 

Humboldt before, so we know we 
can do it,” Condon said. “It helps 
having everyone back and healthy. 
These last two weeks, we’ve worked 
the hardest we have all season. 
Coach [Luyties] has really focused 
in on the things that the other teams 
are doing, and that has helped us.” 

The Tritons will travel to 
Rohnert Park to face Sonoma State 
on Friday, Oct. 16. UCSD will face 
Humboldt State the following night 
in Arcata, Calif.

63rd-minute free kick turned out to 
be the difference, as the Tritons hung 
on despite having to play the last 28 
minutes with 10 men.

The Tritons experienced a turbu-
lent few minutes of the match begin-
ning in the 60th minute, when the 
Tritons were awarded a penalty kick 
but were unable to convert.

Junior forward Kasra Sarabakhsh 
then received his second yellow card 
in the 62nd minute, putting the 
Tritons down a man for the rest of 
the match.

But less than two minutes later, 
and three minutes after coming into 
the match, Zernik placed a free kick 
from the right corner just inside the 
far post to give the Tritons the lead. 

“I give our guys a lot of cred-
it,” head coach Jon Pascale said. “A 
missed penalty and a red card can 
be enough to do you in, but our guys 
didn’t flinch.”

The Golden Eagles were unable 
to capitalize on the man advantage, 
and the Tritons held on for the 
win. Brennan had five saves for the 

Tritons to earn the clean sheet.
“It wasn’t until after the goal — 

which was a well-deserved goal — 
that L.A. started to push numbers 
forward,” Pascale said. “We played a 
lot of guys those last 20 minutes and 
everybody did a great job.”

The Tritons moved to 4-4-4 after 
the weekend slate of games, includ-
ing 4-3-3 in the CCAA. UCSD is 
now 4-0-2 in its last six matches after 
going winless in the first six games 
of the season. The Tritons remain 
stuck in fifth place in the CCAA 
South Division, but trail leaders 
Dominguez Hills by just five points.

The Golden Eagles continued 
their disappointing season, falling 
to 7-4 overall and 6-4 in CCAA 
play after being ranked No. 1 in the 
nation earlier in the year.

The Tritons will return home 
next weekend to face No. 14 Chico 
State at 7 p.m. on Friday, before 
taking on Cal State Stanislaus on 
Sunday.

▶ M. SOCCER, fromÊpageÊ12

the Tritons managed to keep the 
shutout, partly thanks to six saves 
from Armstrong. 

The Golden Eagles outshot the 
Tritons by a 10-6 margin and held a 
4-1 advantage in corner kicks.

UCSD moved to 8-2-2 after the 
weekend games, including 6-2-2 in 
the CCAA. 

The Tritons are now 5-0-2 in 
their last seven matches and sit just 
one point behind the Golden Eagles 
in the CCAA South Division stand-
ings with six matches to play in the 
regular season. The Tritons have 
conceded just four goals in their 
last seven games and have not lost 
since Sept. 17.

The Golden Eagles dropped to 
8-3 overall and 7-3 in CCAA play. 
Cal State L.A. will play two teams 
with losing records in Humboldt 
State and Sonoma State next week-
end, giving them opportunity to 
extend their lead in the conference 
standings.

The Tritons return to action by 
hosting Chico State at 4:30 p.m. on 
Friday. The Tritons will then play 
No. 24 Cal State Stanislaus Oct. 17 
at noon. The Warriors currently sit 
atop the North Division standings 
with a 7-2-1 record.

UCSD SOCCER KEEPS ROLLING
MEN’S SOCCER—After a rough 
start to the season, the UCSD Men’s 
Soccer team continued its recent 
form by earning a draw and a win 
in two weekend games. With those 
performances, the Tritons are now 
unbeaten in six matches.

The Tritons held on for a 0-0 
draw against Cal State Dominguez 
Hills on Friday, despite an onslaught 
in the attack by the Toros. On 
Sunday, Sophomore Adam Zernik’s 
first career goal gave the Tritons a 
1-0 win over Cal State L.A.

Against Dominguez Hills, the 
Tritons to earned a draw despite 
being outshot 18-4. With Redshirt 
freshman Jesse Brennan’s career-
high seven saves, the Tritons were 
able to withstand heavy pressure 
from the Toros to hang on for a 
point. 

Senior Jared Kakura and fresh-
man Alec Arsht — who have played 
every minute of the season so far 
— anchored the Triton backline in 
front of Brennan. The defenders 
helped the Tritons deal with the 
barrage of shots and eight corners 
from the Toros.

Dominguez Hills went to 7-2-2 
overall and 5-2-2 in CCAA play. 
The Toros maintained their lead in 
the CCAA South Division standings 
despite the tie.

UP-AND-DOWN WEEKEND FOR TRITON VOLLEYBALL
By Liam Rose

WOMEN’S VOLLEYBALL — Friday 
night’s game featured two squads whose 
fortunes have gone in opposite direc-
tions this season. Both UCSD and CSUSB 
started the season in the top 10, but only 
the Coyotes have stayed there with a stel-
lar 13-1 record.

The Tritons came out strong and made 
San Bernardino look average in the first 
set, winning by the comfortable score of 
25-17. However, it was all downhill from 
there for the Tritons, and the Coyotes 
won the next three sets, 18-25, 22-25 and 
12-25. 

The Tritons hit .321 in the first set, 
but were unable to maintain that mark 
and ended with a .188 clip for the match. 

Junior outside hitter Katie Condon led the 
Tritons with 11 kills, while junior Roxy 
Brunsting had nine kills, 16 assists and 12 
digs. CSUSB’s Nicole Moore had a match-
high 18 kills, leading three Coyotes that 
had double digit kills on the match.

“Game one was a pretty good perfor-
mance,” head coach Ricci Luyties said. 
“The rest of the match, I would like to 
completely forget about.” 

Despite shuffling personnel because of 
injuries this season, Luyties said he feels 
the team is coming together.

“With all the injuries and people com-
ing in and out, they still haven’t played the 
positions a lot and gotten used to them,” 
Luyties said. “I think it’s just a matter of 
us being inconsistent. I think we come in 
games and play really well, then we come 
out and just give up points like crazy at 

times.”
San Bernardino moved to 13-1 with 

their win, including a perfect 10-0 in 
CCAA play.

The Tritons were able to rebound on 
Saturday night, pulling off a 19-25, 25-22, 
25-19 and 25-15 victory over Cal Poly 
Pomona.

Condon led the way for the Tritons 
once again, tallying 19 kills, 20 digs and 3 
aces. Condon also hit a blistering .354 on 
the match.

“Katie Condon played really well,” 
Luyties said. “She had some really good 
swings and she made some clutch kills 
for us.”

The win was far from comfortable, as 
the Tritons started slow and dropped the 

Cross 
Country Runs 
Strong at 
Triton Classic

CROSS COUNTRY — The cross 
country teams put in quality per-
formances in the Triton Classic on 
Saturday, grabbing two top four 
performances in their annual home 
meet.

The Triton men finished second 
out of five teams competing, fall-
ing five points behind conference 
rival Cal Poly Pomona. The Broncos 
scored 36 points with all of their five 
scoring runners in the top 11 overall.

“In this race, we really wanted 
to get a measure of where we stood 
in the conference,” head coach Nate 
Garcia said. “Pomona is the defend-
ing runner-up from last year, so we 
knew they were going to be a test 
for us. We ran well, we were closing 
on them, so we’re really curious to 
see how it plays when we race them 
next week.”

On the men’s side, redshirt senior 
Jesse Morrill had a career-best race 
on the Tritons’ 10k home course, 
clocking 32:10 to finish third overall. 
Morrill’s time was nearly 30 seconds 
faster than his previous best for the 
course.

“It was a great bounce-back from 
his last time out,” Garcia said. “He 
wasn’t very happy with his perfor-
mance in Minnesota, so he was really 
focused on doing well here on the 
home course.”

Running close behind Morrill 
was a trio of Triton runners, com-
prised of sophomore Matt Lenehan, 
freshman Kellen Levy and freshman 
Mario Flores. They clocked 33:27, 
33:36 and 33:40 to finish eighth, 
ninth and 10th, respectively.

WOMEN’S SOCCER — The UCSD Women’s 
Soccer team continued its hot streak over the 
weekend, winning both matches to extend its 
unbeaten streak to seven games.

Junior midfielder Lindsay Mills found the 
right time to score her first career goal, slotting 
home in the 85th minute on Friday to give the 
Tritons a 2-1 win over Cal State Dominguez Hills. 
The Tritons then picked up a 1-0 win against No. 
15 Cal State L.A. on Sunday to win their fourth 
straight game.  

Against Dominguez Hills, the Tritons earned 
the win despite losing the lead with 15 minutes 
to play and being outshot 10-4. Junior forward 
Sarah McTigue scored the opening goal in the 
54th minute, capitalizing off a pass inside the box 
from junior midfielder Shelby Wong. McTigue’s 
goal was her team-best fifth of the season.

The Toros found the equalizer in the 71st 
minute, when Jessica Murphy put in a good shot 
from the top of the box to beat junior keeper 
Kristin Armstrong. Despite giving up the goal, 
Armstrong had another solid game and finished 
with four saves.

UCSD was able to find the winner in the 
85th minute, as Dominguez Hills keeper Alyssa 
Congdon failed to clear a cross from sophomore 
midfielder Alexa Enlow. The rebound fell at the 
feet of Mills, who neatly slotted home to put 
UCSD up 2-1.

Dominguez Hills fell to 7-3-1 overall and 5-3-1 
in CCAA play. The Tritons overtook the Toros for 
second place in the CCAA South Division with 
the victory.

On Sunday, junior midfielder Annie Wethe 
scored her third goal of the season in the 32nd 
minute, and the Tritons held on for the rest of the 
match to keep their win streak alive. 

Wethe placed a long shot from 20 yards out 
into the top corner of the net to beat the Golden 
Eagle’s keeper. Each of the goals Wethe has scored 
this season have ended up being the winning goal 
in the match.  

Cal State L.A. had several good chances, 
including a shot from Gabbi Segall that careened 
of the woodwork in the 37th minute. However,
