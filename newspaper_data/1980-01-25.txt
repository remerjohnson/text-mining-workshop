Nuclear Lab 
Shaken In 
Earthquake 

By Carolyn Friday 
Sacramento Correspondent 

A northern California earthquake 
registering 5.5 on the Richter scale 
forced 7,000 UC employees to 
evacuate the buildings of the nucelar 
research laboratory at Livermore at 11 
am yesterday. 

No structural damage or radioactive 
leaks were reported. 

One person with a previous history 
of heart trouble was removed in an 
ambulance, and 25 others were treated 
for minor cuts and injuries at Valley 
Memorial Hospital in Livermore 
before being sent home . . 

The nuclear reactor, which is a low 
level pipe used for research and not for 
generating power, was operating at the 
time of the earthquake but shut itself 
down , automatically, according to 
Jeffrey Garberson, a spokesman for 
Livermore lab. 

"The safety system came through as 
if we were set up for an advertisement," 
Garberson said. 

A year ago it was decided for 
budgetary reasons to close down the 
reactor, but Garberson said it was still 
doing four-hour shifts at the time of the 
quake. 

Approximately 1,200 structures --
trailers and buildings -- are on the 
Livermore premises, which were built 
in 1952 by the government. About 20 
to 25 of these actually house 
experimental labs using radioactive 
substances. 

Most of the buildings are reinforced 
and have special containment features 
built in. 

Twenty-five engineers are presently 
checking the premises for radiation 
leakage, but the structural damage 
appears to be limited to a few broken 
windows, according to Garberson. 

Bruce Bolt, director of the UC 
Berkeley seismic station, said the 
quake was moderate. 

Bolt determined the quake was 
located 12 miles north of Livermore 
and 30 miles east of Berkeley. The 
epicenter was 12 miles beneath the 
surface near the Antioch fault. 

Because of a miscalculation as to the 
dosenelS of the quake, the Berkeley 
seismic .tation first read the quake at 
5.8 on the Richter scale, but it was later 
adjusted down to 5.5. 

Two aftershocks were felt at 11 :02 
am and 11 :03 am, according to Bolt. 

Bolt, who had predicted that 
California would experience a major 
quake of at leat 7.0 on the Richter scale 
in the next 10 years, said this was not 
the one. 

From the fifth floor of a seven floor 
office building at Lawrence laboratory, 
Garberson described the quake as 
"very frightening." 

"It's the sharpest jolt I have ever felt 
in my tile. All of a sudden everything 
was shaking and rocking back and 
forth beyond any controt.--Even if you 
wanted to, you couldn't have stopped a

New, Used Records In 
Student Center Planned 

By Taylor Dark 
Staff Writer 

The AS Council moved one step 
closer Wednesday night to establishing 
an AS-run record shop to open spring 
quarter in the Student Center office 
formerly occupied by The Daily 
Guardian. 

The Council tentatively approved 
the sale of new and used records, plants 
and video-cassettes in the store. Final 
approval of the store and its inventory 
is expected by Feb. 6, after a formal 
budget has been presented. 

AS President Carlos Montalvo said 
the store will be "just another service 
for the students" and compared it with 
other AS ventures such as initial 
funding of the FoOd Co-op and funding 
of the Student Internship Office. 

Montalvo cited an AS survey last 
quarter in which those who responded 
favored selling recorda in the store over 
any other item. He said the emphasis of 
today's student· government should be 
on providing more services and less 
political squabbling. 

Although there has been some 
concern that the store would be a 
financial risk for the AS, "The 
inventory was decided upon 
consideration of the survey and with 
budget restraints in mind," AS Council 
member Robb Strom said. An attempt 
will be made to buy as many records as 
possible , on consignment. Strom 
added, so they can be returned to the

'Questions 
Flood In On -
Draft Status 

By Jeff Beresford·Howe 
News Editor 

Wednesday'. announcement by 
President Carter that he wanted to 
reinstitute registration for the draft has 
sparked interest in conscientious 
objector status, the Central Committee 
on Conscientious Objectors reports. 

Bl'\lce Jugan, a CCCO organizer in 
San Francisco, says his office hal been 
flooded with calls since Carter'. State 
of the Union address a.king Congres. 
to allocate funds for reviving the 
Selective Service System. 

But most of the callers were told that 
they caMot apply for CO statu. until 
they are actually drafted, a .tep the 
office of Congressman Ron Oellwn., a 
leader in the anti-draft movement, say. 
is "months, even years away_" 

While provision •• till exist in military 
law for CO filing, the CCCO say., only 
enlisted or drafted men are allowed to 
file. 

There is no mechanism for filing for 
CO status during registration. 

Prospective CO. must prove three 
things: that they are opposed to all 
wars; that their beliefs are based on 
religious, moral or ethcial grounds 
("You can't file just because you think 
the US is bei~ imperialist in Iran," 

etan say.. "Ta., US ~ that a itical obiettion")j and that those liefs are sincerely held. · 
The CCCO and Odiums' office say 

those prOVIsions will probably remain 
intact if there is a draft. 

Because the draft ended in 1973, 
some 25 and 26 year olds still eligible 
for the draft have been placed in a 
curious legal position, Dellums' office 
says. They are still draftable, and, the 
office thinks, their CO status may have 
expired. 

"But they would probably have an 
excellent case for getting CO now," a 
Dellums staffer added. 

The CCCO, which has followed 
attempts to restore the draft, lists 
several probable changes in those who 
will be required to register. 

Women, they believe, will be asked 
to register, as will college students. 

And CCCO representatives think 
Carter's registration proposal will paIS 
Congress within a month.

Tunnel Vision 
In calling for drah registration of America's young 

men, President Carter is overlooking more 
appropriate me~rea available to the US government 
to respond to the Soviet Union's invasion of 
Afghani.tan and ita threat to the Western world's 
prinicipal oil route. Because these other measures 
have not been taken, we believe that reinstitution of 
reai*ation, which i. a major step toward war, is 
unwarranted. 

Clearly, Carter believes a return by Congress to 
mandatory draft registration would show the Soviets 
that the US is willing to mobilize militarily against 
Soviet expansion through eastern Iran and western 
Pakiltan to the Penian CuH. But guessing the Soviets' 
reaction to that kind of .ymbolism is a risky 
proposition. For instance, the Russians probably know 
that it would take eight ~ ten months for the US to get 
new troopi ready. And JUit when commentators weJ;e 
suggesting that Soviet. had undere.timated the extent 
01 international outrage over their Afghanistan 
invasion, they exhibited indifference to world opinion 
by banishing dissent leader Andrei Sakharov to 
internal exile. 

1ne threat to American interests in the Persian Gulf 
is economic,..not mili'·lr.' ,ncf ... . , J. ,' li~Vf> t~Rt Carter ' 
IhouId use non-military weapons to fight It: 

- A pennanent, total ban on American (and, if 
Carter can get the support of other countries, NATO) 
exports of technology and grain to Russia; 

- Withdrawing from the Olympics and penuading 
other nation. to do the same; 

- Extensive military aid and boosted trade 
relations with China; and 

- A program of tight gasoline rationing and a 
national commitment to alternative energy sources. 

None of these measures is as dramatic as the hint 
that mobilization to meet the Soviet threat is just 
around the comer, and President Carter has probably 
not overlooked the favorable impact his call for draft 
registration will have on the popularity he is enjoying 
as the leader of a newly "unified" nation. But aU the 
measures are more appropriate; most of them, 
especially the last one, would demand sacrifices by 
every American, not just those subject to the draft. 

The only reason a "Carter Doctrine" for the 
protectipn of the Persian Gulf is now in force is that the 
Congress, the President and the American people 
have failed to commit themselves to confronting the 
inevitable and escalating crises resulting from the 
world's scramble for fossil fuels. America's youths 
should not suffer for that failure.

Residue From Vietna1l1 
By Mike Einlilber 

Thouaands 01 ex·Gls want 
the government to tell them 
whether they carry in their 
bodies one of the world's 
deadliest chemicals, a grim 
residue of America's Vietnam 
years. 

Mike Einsi/ber is a writer 
lor the Associated Press, 

The men fear their health 
will break down - or even 
that they may die - as a result 
of their exposure in Vietnam to 
the herbicide dubbed Agent 
Orange becaUJe it was packed 
in bright orange drums. 

Some already tell of ringing 
in their ears, losing their 
toenail. or their leX drive; and 
a ~tifying v~ of other 
ailments. Government 
researchers are looking for 
answer. but say it may take 
years to find them. 

For nine years , Air Force 
planes sprayed more than 10 
million gallons of Agent 
Orange over Vietnam, trying 
to kill off thick jungle growth 
that concealed communist 
forces. 

Thousands of American 
servicemen went into sprayed 
areas. Some were drenched in 
Agent Orange. 

The spraying stopped in 
1971 , but not before 
Vietnamese women had 
begun reporting an increase in 
stillbirths. 

No one knew then that a by· 
product of Agent Orange is 
dioxin, a substance one 
researcher says is a million 

times more poisonous than 
PCBs - polychlorinated 
biphenyls - which the 
government has banned as 
carcinogens. Agent Orange is 
a 50·50 mixture of two 
chemicals. 

Dioxin is created in the 
manufacture of one of them, 
UJe of which was banned last 

More than 5,000 
vets have come 
into V A hospitals. 
year by the Environmental 
Protection Agency after it was 
linked to miscarriages in 
Oregon. 
. The official position of the 
Veterans Administration is 
that "no conclusive evidence" 
links Agent Orange with any 
disease. Still, when a 

. serviceman is ill, he is eligible 
for treatment in VA hospitals. 
He need not show that his 
ailment , is caused by Agent 
Orange. 

If, however, a connection 
existed , the veteran would also 
be eligible for disability 
payments. The catch is that 
even if research establishes 
that men who were sprayed 
are in danger, no treatment 
exists to counter the effects of 
dioxin. 

V A officials plan to study 
the men coming in with the 
mystifying complaints to see if 
one common experience 
among _ them might bE' 

exposure to Agent Orange. 
Dr. Paul A.L. Haber, the 

VA's assistant chief medical 
director, heads a 12·member 
Advisory Committee on 
Health·Related Effects of 
Herbicides , which is 
overseeing the study. It meets 
four times a year. 

In an interview, Haber 
made these points: 

-More than 5,000 
veterans have come into VA 
hospitals to ask about Agent 
Orange or to report ailments 
they attribute to exposure,. and 
the number of complaints is 
increasing. 

"The complaints that seem 
to be most commonly 
experienced are numbness 
and tingling of the fingers, 
insomnia headaches, change 
of personality, loss of ~bido, 
impotence, allegations ' of 
malformed children and skin 
rashes," Haber said. 

-Only one veter an has 
been awarded disability 
payments because of an illness 
~nked to Agent Orange. The 
serviceman, receiving a 10 
percent disability award of 
$48.40 a month, suffers from 
chloracne, a painful skin rash. 

-"Chaotic" service 
record. make it impossible to 
know how many of the 2.4 
mimon men who served in 
Vietnam were . exposed. In 
November, the General 
Accounting Office determined 
that 19,000 Marines were 
stationed near sprayed areas 
within four weeks of spraying. 

In Sickness and Health, Til Death Do Us Part 
Asked to speculate whether 

their exposure to Agent 
Orange threatens their health, 
Haber hedged. 

"I can't really give you any 
hunch," he said. "I am, as 
most people with my 
perspective and training are, 
very concerned."

We never did have that much in common. Not in high school,

to divert my attentions from Bellow to Hesse. 

Still, we both did want to go to college, and we both made it 
that far.

But Anne is bracing herself against a future I'm not facing yet: 
death. Not her death, though sometimes she wishes it was, but 
her husband's (it', still difficult for me to think of them as 
married). He has already passed his deadline for the final blow 
fr(lm cancer. 

Sound like a storybook tale? It is. For Ame and Will, at least, 
it's a scenario from a trashy soap opera. They really don't 
believe it will happen. 

And how could they believe it? When he's 10 young? So 
treative, ambitious, succes.fuI, brilliant. And so young. 

I had trouble believini it. After all, who had heard of 
melanoma kiBing a 23.year.oId? When I think back to last year, 
I can lee they were scared. And now, they are 10 calm, 10 quietly 
defiant, 10 close, 10 re.tless. And they don't talk about it in 
"",S anymore. They're making plana. 

And Will is still writing - apparendy that's about all he can 

do now - and he e~en managed to finish hi. novel for 
Christmas. And he met his wildest goal: seeing the Star Trek 
screen blitz. He's not making any more of his crazy films. Noris 
he on the stage anymore, or doing his radio skits. And I guess he 
doesn't get much sleep, with all the coughing and discomfort. 

She wanted his baby. As a messenger of tradition, a 
reincarnation. When she'll have another 50 or even 60 years 
ahead of her, perhaps. My God, st., can't do that, I thought. 
And she hasn'that least not yet. EverYone else was vehemently 
opposed, and s e wasn't able to bu~ the support she needed . 
I've so,!,etimes wondered if it isn't selfish Jor them to keep her 
from doing it. Later, I think, I'll be ;ad they did. 

His brother, naturally, wants to speiad the.e last moments with 
Will. And so does his father. And especially his mother, who 
find. it hard right now to live under the I8me roof as Anne. 
Anne, who sleeps with him every night and who has completely 
devoted benelf to him. 

When I took Anne out at Christmas she was .tarved for the 
div~sion. To lIo .out for a movie and drink! Her excitement 
reminded me of high 1Choo1. . . .

That was only the leCond time I d seen them last year. Once

Uphill Battle Seen 
Against Draft Reg 
WASHINGTON - Opponents of President Carter's plan to 
register draft.age youths vowed yesterday to "picket, teach·in, 
protest and demonstr~te" in every major city, but acknowledged 
they will have a hard time stopping the program . . 

As student goups and others mapped campaigns to rally 
public opinion against registration, several members of 
Congress denounced Carter's action and promised to try to 
block it. 

One idea being examined is an attempt to deny the 
administration the money it would need to take the Selective 
Service System out of mothballs, where it has been since 1975 
when Gerald Ford halted registration. 

Congress also would have to change Selective Service laws· if 
Carter decided to compel women as well as men to register. In 
his State of the Union address Wednesday, in which he 
announced plans to begin registration for the draft, Carter did 
not say whether he intended to register women. Administration 
officials have said that is an "open question." ' 

The President already has strong backing on registration from 
key congressional leaders, including Senate Democratic Leader 
Robert Byrd and House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill, and it 
appears now that his plan would be approved. 

House Republican Leader John Rhodes of Arizona said 
Carter has "overwhelming support" among Republicans on the 
issue and that he sees no effective opposition to it from any 
quarter. .

Rrofits to Women's Athletics. 
By Samantha Roby 

"The End" appears to be the beginning 
01 a fortunate experience for the UCSD 
Women's Athletics Foundation. 

Charles Lockhart , owner of "The End " 
hair cutting salon in Del Mar will be 
sponsoring a special fund raiser for UCSD 
women's athletics this Saturday and 
Sunday. 

lockhart feels that not enough 
money or recognition has been given to 
women's athletics . He believes tha t women 
have been "forced" to give up athletics 
because there hasn't been enough rewards 
in it for them. 

All profits netted in the shop during the 
weekend will be donated to the fund . The 
price for a haircut varies anywhere from 
$18 to $35 and a minimum dona tion of $5 

Lockhart's donations are not going 
to single handedly change the situation but 
it is a good start for UCSD. He say~ he 
hopes other people will follow his precedent 
and be more supportive, both socially and 
financia lly, of women's a thletics. 

is being asked. . 
For thi s weekend , no intricate 
proced~res , such as permanents , coloring 
and light french. braiding, will be 
performed. Lockhart will concentrate on 
cutting and blow-drying. 

This weekend is not the extent of the 
fund-raiser, Lockhart saYll. When a UCSD 
student brings a validated Student ID to 
"The End", half of the proceeds will be 
donated to the women's a thle t ic 
department.

'Dance'Sets Good Precedent at the Pub 
Original Jazz 
Received Well 

By William Hamilton 
Jazz·lovers were treated to a 

delightful evening of superb 
en edainment at Walk 's Pub last 
Wednesday night, as the musical 
group . "Dance of the niverse" 
performed a selection of theIr original 
compositions and demonstra p a 
mastery of their instruments which 
belie their youth. 

Featuring guitarist Peter Sprague 
and vocalist Kevin Lettau, "Dance of 
the Universe" captivated a near 
capacity crowd in the first of a series of 
performances scheduled by University 
Events. If the crowd response and 
enthusiasm is indicative of the acts to 
come, the series should be major 
entertainment events. 

The group plays eclectic material 
with mainstream jazz roots , although it 
is "progressive" in terms 01 the 
effective use of percussion to enliven 
and fill out songs which might 
otherwise suffer from the absence of 
keyboards . Sprague was extremely 
effective in chording, embellishing 
intrica te chord progressions with 
tasteful vamping and breezy, almost 
flawless , runs. In synergy with bassist 
Jeff Lefwich, drummer Kelly Jacoy , . 
and percussion instrumentation, the 
rhythm section foundation is solid and 
full.sounding, but perhaps. suffers 
somewhat in expression during 
Sprague's 5010s. 

Sprague's solos were interesting,and 
forceful. Many of his phrases

res"anse phraling with the ba ... 
Kevin Lettau'l voice haa a pleaaing 

timbre, and her phrasing, elpecially 
during scat·type vocals il rdzgerald 
influenced. An interesting variation in 
her ainging is the frequent use of 
humming, nonsense syllablea, and 
imitation of the reed in.trumentl which 
speaks well for her versatility. There 
were. however, occasions during which . 
she appeared to strain to hit certain 
higher"pitched notes, and the dynamics 
and resonance of the vocal. suffered. 

Wind instrument player Tripp 
Sprague's soloing sounded remarkably 
like it was inspired by Johnny Dodds, 
an apparent incongruity within the 
context of their material, but it worked. 
The drumming was precise, although 
fills were kept to a minimum. Thismay 
perhaps have been a poor approach, 
since the percussion prevalent 
throughout the tunes could have given 
the drums the opportunity to explore 
some interesting polyrhythmic 
embellishments. 

The material performed runs the 
gamut of influences, exploring 
everything from Middle·Eastern 
flavoring to rock. h was noticeable that 
many of the melody lines emphasized 
the harmonic minor scale, a trademark 
of Paul Winter. Their theme 50ng, 
"Dance of the Universe," began with a 
prolonged percussion segment, derived 
from Chicago's "Only the Beginning." 
It featured a poem put to music by 
Peter Sprague, which Lettau's singing 
did justice to, and a guitar solo during 
which Sprague interspersed a 'Tequila' 
chord solo. The surprise of the evening 
was a powerful rendition of Dton 
John's "Your Song", reinterpreted in a 
samba tempo.
