Register to vote 
A lot of you are going to be in for a real 

surprise when you go vote on campus Nov. 4. 
That "Tom Metzger - small businessman " 

you see on your 43rd congressional district 
ballot is the same Tom Metzger who became 
the first California member of the Ku Klux 
Klan to win a major party nomination. 

Some of you will miss that surprise because 
you haven't registered to vote, and you will be 
at fault if Metzger wins or even does well 
enough to capitalize on the race in other 
political and social areas. 

There is still time to register , though. 
Today is the last day, and the ' Registrar of 
Voters has geared up a major effort to get you 
on the voting rolls. They've established 
information booths all over the coun t y, 
including on campus, and there are scores of 

inde~ndent efforts on behalf of political 
candidates and causes. 

U Metzger's not enough, Ronald Reagan, 
Paul Gann (whose Prop, 13 has gutted the 
university) and various other conservatives are 
threatening to get elected. There are also a 
n~mber of candidates or propositions you 
might even want to support, 

So there is a reason to vote this year. It's 
quick and easy to register - you can still do 
it by mail. And you can save yourself and the 
county_ a lot of pain.

Surprising outcomes possible 
in war between Iran and Iraq 
BY F, SCHURMANN 
How t he Iran·Iraq war 

ends could -a lso spell victory 
or defeat for the State 
Department or the National 
Securi ty Council, who have 
been battling each other over 
whose underst anding of t he 
world situ ation is righ t ever 
s ince Pres ident Carter came 
to power. 

Bu t, as Iranian resistance 
toughens and the revolu· 
tionary spir it helps mobilize 
the population , new out· 
comes are possible that could 
confound both these views 
and lead to entirely new, 
barely imaginable situations. 

If Iraq wins, then National 
Security affairs adviser 
Zbigniew Brzezinski 's views 
will have proven to be 
correct. At the very least , 
Iraqi victory means giving 
Baghdad control over the 
territory in the oil producing 
region already taken . 
However, it is widely believed 
that the real reasons for the 
Iraqi attack were to bring 
down the Khomeini regime in 
Iran. 

Many in Iran believe that a 
US signal to Iraq and t he ant i-
Khomeini Iranian for ces 
there unleashed the attack. If 
so, that signal would have 
come from the Brzezinski 
side that has always held the 
Khomeini r~me to be brittle 
- a quick Jab at it would 
bring about a quick collapse. 
Brzezinski believes that only 
tough , elite regimes can 
control countries. Further, 
he believes that Khomeini's 
regime is going to fall onry to 
be succeeded by tough leftists 
unless the United States gets 
in first with pro-US exiles, 
like General Oveissi , now in 
Iraq. 

On the other hand, the 
State Department is trying 
hard to bring about a 
different outcome. It is . 
consulting with the Soviet 
Union and all the regional 
powers to put pressure on 
both Iran and Iraq to end the 
fighting and withdraw 
within their own terr itories. 

The State Department 
line, first held by Cyrus 
Vance lind now by Edmund 
Muskie. does not believe the 
Khomeini regime is doomed. 
Not only could it survive, but 
like other revolut ionary 
regimes elsewhere, it could 
switch from radicalism to 
pragmatism. The essence of 
the State Department line is

Pacific Nen &n'ict. 

that internat ional pre u re 
can bring bot h com batant s to 
their senses. 

Bu t if t he unexpected 
should happen, namely, t hat 
Iran not only holds up under 
Iraqi at tack, but succeeds in 
rou ti ng the Iraqis, t hen 
drast ic changes could occur 
It could lead, not to t ht! 
di si nt egr a t io n of the 
Khomeini regime, bu t to the 
downfall of Saddam Hussein, 
t he ru thless Iraq i leader. 

Saddam Hussein eviden tly 
s hared B rzezinski's qu ick 
jab/ quick collapse view on 
Iran . Early reports coming 
out of Baghdad reflected the 
supreme confidence of the 
Iraqis that victory would 
follow a few days ' fighting. 

Hussein runs one of the 
toughest dictators hips in tne 
world. While having achieved 
considerable econo m ic 
development t hough oil 
revenues that have improved 
living standards, Saddam 
Hussein has also murdered 
all opposition. 

One of his most heinous 
acts was the execution of the 
Shiah religious leader in Iraq , 
a close friend of the Ayatollah 
Khomeini . Saddam Hussein 
attacked Iran hopin~ that a 
tough new leader might take 
power in Teheran , someone 
l ike the former shah 's 
General Oveissi now fighting 
on the Iraqi s ide w ith pro-
s hah exiles. 

Much of the rest of the 
Arab world supports Iraq 
more because the ruling elite 
supports the ruling elite 
rather than pan·Arabism. 
Syria , whose leder Hafiz al · 
Assad is a Shiite, wavers . 
Saudi Arabia has lined up 
with Marxis t Iraq . Both 
regimes fear t he populist and 
revolutionary zeal spreading 
out from Iran. 

Overthrow of the Kho-
meini regime would satisfy 
the Brzez ins ki line. It would 
score points with once hostile 
Iraq and would have a good 
chance of seeing a pro·US 
regime come to power in 
Teheran. And such a regime 
would. like that of the late 
Shah Pahlavi, be friendly to 
the Soviets at the same time. 

But the increasingly 
irritating 'fly in the 
ointment' is the evident 
fighting power o f the 
Iranians. Former enemies in 
Teheran are making peace 
with each othE"r. A powerful 
general mobilization is going 
on. And Iraqi forces on the • 
front line are encountering 
stiffer resis tance. 

Saddam Hussein and his 
new fou nd s u pport er s 
el!IeWhere may ha\'e for· 
gotten or iRoored the lessons 

of history - t hat revolut ions 
have the power to ignite 
hitherto pass ive and inert 
peoples in to defending their 
revolu t io n s, brave ly and 
passionately. 

Con tinuing Irania n abi lity 
to fi~ht has raised a nother 
pOSSIbi l ity . I ra n i fast 
runn ing out of jet fuel and 
spare parts for its weaponry. 
If Teheran were to offer a 
trade off of US hostages for 
resupply, t he US would be in 
a very painfu I position. 

If the US rejected the offer 
in order to give not the 
s lightes t app earan ce of 
ti lting to one side, it could 
mea n t he death of t he 
hostages. If it accepted, it 
could tr igger a s im ilar 
resu pply by the Soviets to the 
Iraqis. The Iraqis are almost 
entirely outfitted with Soviet 
weapons and the Iranians 
with US weapons. 

Pres ident Carter has 
implied that the Iranians, 
now largely isolated in the 
world diplomatic commu· 
nity , needs friends and could 
get friends if they first 
released the host ages. But 
the Iranians, involved in a 
life-or·death struggle, would 
obvious ly want something 
more tangible than that. 

Thi s new s ituation 
envi s io n s a t wo way 
settlement of the disputes 
between the US and Iran. On 
t he one hand it could 
conceivably lead to a US·Irani 
rapprochement that now 
appears as unlikely as that 
between the United States 
and China seemed a decade 
ago. Many in Iran ironically 
believe that the United States 
secr et l y s uppo rt the 
Khomeini regime , at the 
same t ime tha t others are 
convinced the US played a 
hand in egging Saddam 
Hussein on to the attack. 

On the other hand, supply 
arms again to Iran and IraQ

" If they dismiss the case,lt 
would be a total victory for 
us," he says. A dlsm Issal 
would mean that the police 
would not have to answer to 
the discoveries asked for by 
the defense. 

On Friday, the prosecution 
was prepared to go forward 
with their case, as the three 

Anderson noted t hat if 
these factors were removed 
from consideration "the 
producer price index did not 
go down at all - it went up 
eight tenths of one percent." 

Following Ihp rall y, 
Anderson and his staff flew 
bark to Washington. DC . to 
finalize their "National Unity 
Campaign" strategy for the 
final four weeks before the 
election. 

hearing 
"most involved" officers of 
the eight listed by t he defense 
were present to testify . 

The three officers, Larry 
Wright . Dick Coulsen and M. 
Parga . were overheard 
discussi ng the case outside 
the courtroom, but when 
approached by reporters. 
they refused to comment on 
the case, and denied that they 
were there for t he hearing. 

However. Novak and 
ot.hers identified Wright as 
the officer who handcuffed 
her when she could not 
produce identification . 
Wright claims he was not 
even at the demonstration. 

Sosna expects that the 
three officers will return for 
the hearing but he doubt s 
that their testimony will be 
credible in court.

Goettingen. West Germany. 
"Most of us (the UC students) 
found the work at the 
university easier but .the 

language difference compen-

think it will be like a year off

really did have to study," she

students do ~ the normal

Triton 
under 

soccer squad 
ne\V tnanagelllent 

Drop first match to Cal Lutheran 
BY GIL SAIDY 

Tre Conrique. starting his 
first season this year as 
soccer coach of the Tritons. is 
hopeful the players will soon 
become accustomed to his 
system of coaching. 

UCSD will play in an 
lI8IP'essive. controlled sytle. 
which Conrique hopes will 
eliminate the stupid 
mistakes that lose soccer 
games. Working the ball from 
the back to the front . his plan 
is to keep the ball away from 
the opposi tion' s collecti ve 
feet. This takes time to learn. 
but Conrique has confidence 
in a group' of athletes he 
considers 'excellent indivi· 
duals and smart, hard 
workers. We've got a young 

SQuad (there are only two 
enior on the team) and 

we're going to have to build 
from game to game." 

Conrique is a native of San 
Diego. and has played at 
Point Lorna College and 
coached four years at Kearny 
High . With this background 
he can see potential for a 
powerful program at UCSD. 
Since there are student from 
all over the cou ntry attendin~ 
the campu, a "natura)' 
recruiting system can be 
developed by the coach and 
the students. 

Because NAIA (National 
Association for Intercol · 
legiate Athletics) rules 
allowed Connque OnlY two 
full weeks of practice before 

the first match last week, the 
team lost their initial contest 
at Cal Lutheran 3·]. 

On Saturday against 
fourth ranked We tmont 
College , the Tritons 
dominated part of the game 
but cou ldn 't manage to put 
the ball in the net and 10 t 3·0. 
In Tuesday' home opener 
again t Biola College, the 
Tritons fell behind 2·1 at 
halftime and then worsened 
matters by playing away 
from Conrique's speci fied 
tyle. 
Even though the soccer 

team is 0·3, Conrique i still 
confident that the team will 
take each game as it comes. 
each with a new attempt at 
triumph. The soccer team has opened their season 0·3 and over the weekend faced the rest of the UC schools in Soccer All -Cal.

Rugby team 
New· Zealand 

gets 
coach 

BY DIRK VAN PEENAN 
The rugby team has another new coach this year in 

accordance with past easons. The last two years two coaches 
have arrived and departed - one from New Zealand, the other 
a native Californian. 

This. year's coach, Russel Skerrett, is also from New 
Zealand. He was not given the official position as head coach 
until recently, although he is not entirely new to the team. 

Sports 
Last season while coaching a Del Mar club, Skerrett briefly 
helped coach the UCSD side. 

Skerrett began playing rugby when he was six and played 
throughout his school years, eventually going on to be a 
member of a provincial New Zealand team. His small stature 
(5'10", 160 pounds), compared to opponents who weighed as 
much as 250 pounds and frequent injuries put a halt to hi 
playing career. Four years ago he was a ked to coach the 
Cristchurch College B (second) team in New Zealand, one of 
the oldest rugby clubs in the world.

"Their second team wa. 
the first team that I ever 
coached," he sa id . "We won 
the championship with that 
team. for t he first time in 
twelve year at the school. " 

He ha s found that 
American teams are more 
oriented toward th indivi · 
dual than the team. 

"That's t he hardest parI -
get ting I he at hletes to playas 
a team." . 

Despite this, he ha praise 
for t he UCSD ruggers. not ing 
that there are "some good 
young players" at our school. 
The new coach i also pleased 
with the numberof returning 
starters. 

" I understand that a lot of 
last year's team is back again 
this year - we're not losing 
many - so I think th<:t 
there's going to be quite a 
good team thi . year." 

A good running attack may 
be the key to a winning 
season. .

Iran-Iraq 
strategies 
coatinued from pale 2 
by the two ' super powers 
coultf lead to a US-Soviet 
proxy war being waged on 
the eve of t he US election. It 
could lead to the most erious 
confrontat ion between the 
two super powers since the ' 
end of World War II. Clearly, 
the frantic diplomatic moves 
now underway in world 
capital are designed to 
forestall such an eventuality. 

Should Iran gain the upper 
hand, it will mean that it was 
the Ayatollah Khomeini and 
the Islamic Revolution that 
gave the Iranians unexpected 
new strength. It is not likely 
that Khomeini will then call a 
halt to please powers he 
considers "satanic." He has a 
revolutionary vision for 

I cleansing all Islam. President 
Sadat of Egypt, who presides 
over a country w here the rich 
and powerful rule, knows 
this and ha called the 
overthrow of the Khomeini 
regime a top priority goal in 
the Middle East.
