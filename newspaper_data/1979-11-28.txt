81 Students Not Paid On Time, 
70% Advance Called Inadequate 

William McGill, chancellor here from 1969 to 
1972, has resigned as president of Columbia 
University and will return to San Diego next year. 

He told the Christian Science Monitor he plans to 
spend the next few years writing. 

While chancellor, McGill gained a national 
reputation for the smooth, tolerant way he handled 
student dissidents. He was allO popular amon& facult)' 
for his refusal to fire the late Herbert Marcuse, whose 
work drew th~ ire of Gov. Reagan, State School 
Superintendant Max Rafferty and other rightist 
politicians and political groups. 

At Columbia, he contributed to solving that school's 
financial problems, which threatened to close the 
school. McGill was instrumental in raising $120 
million in capital improvements, and doubled tuition 
in his fint year there .

A slow processing system 
combined with increased numbers 
of new fall students has brought 
complaints from students who 
have not been paid on time, Don 
Suicott, UCSD Payroll Office 
Supervisor says. 

Of the 3,509 total checks issued 
for the September pay period, 81 , 
roughly two percent of the total, 
weren't issued properly, according 
to Suicott. 

"All of the 81 were student 
checks, Suicolt added. 

The payroll office has issued 70 
percent advances to students 
whose checks have been held up. 

'The 70 percent advance 
amounts to almost as much as 
what the student would normally 
receive after taxes and other 
deductions ," Suicott said. 

But Phyllis Walker , Student 
Affairs Officer for Student 
Employment, says that the 70 
percent figure might be low for 
most students. 

"I think that if it is legally 
permissible, th advance could be 
raised to at least 80 percent and 
still be on the safe side as far as 
most student paychecks are 
concern d," Walker sai d. 

Poy-roll Office Manager Shirley 
Loranger said that a 70 percent 
advance seems to be the most 
equitable for all, including 
students, faculty and staff." 

"At the present time, we don 't 
have any way of distinguishing 
between th e ca tegories of 
employees for the purposes of an 
advance:' said Loranger. "But the 

problem is certainly worth looking 
into," she added. 

"There is always a problem 
meeting deadlines this time of 
year," Suicott said. "Our system 
requires that we terminate all 
student e'Jlployees who will not be 
working during the summer and 
then re·hire them in the fall if they 
come back to work at a campus 
job." 

According to Suicott, the 
extraordinarily long lead time -
that is, the time from when a 
student submits his time l>heet to 
the time his paycheck is issued ' ~ 

sometimes interferes with proper 
processing of the checks. 

Walker explained that becaUlie 
of the long lead time, it is 
impossible to process all of the new 
student employee forms into the 

. system on time. "Departments 
should tell their student employees 
that their first check will be late," 
she said. 

"The problem il> much more 
severe during fall quarter becauloe 
of all the new forms that must be 
processed," Suicott said. "We 
won't have this problem the next

Glider J:>ort Closed Yesterday 
After Radioactive Glass Found 

By Peter Mortensen 
Staff Writer 

Radioactive glass and lab ware missing from Scripps Clinic in La Jolla 
was discovered yesterday in the Torrey Pines Glider Port. The four 
boxes of contaminated material posed no threat to human health, a clinic 
spokesperson said, though the port was dosed for some time after the 
recovery. . 

"The boxes did not contain any radioactive source," said Jim Boylan, 
public information officer for the clinic. " All that was in them (the boxes) 
was used lab equipm nt - mostly glassware - that had been used 
in handling low. level radioactive material at one time. " 

Because the boxes were found in a remote area of the glider port, 
located about a mile and a half from the clini , Boylan said, " It is quite 
clear that th containers were stolen, but the motive or persons involved ' 
are ·till unknown at this time ." 

San Diego Police Department officials in La Jolla said last night they 
were investigating the incident but had not yet clasltified the 
disappearance as a theft. 

Two of the boxes were first found at the port at 11 am yesterday, while 
a follow-up search of the area turned up two more boxes later in the day 
at 3 pm. It wall not disclosed when, if at any time, the containers were 
reported missing from the clinic. 

While police conduct their own investigation into the matter , Boyland 

Sexual Harassment Surveyed Here 
said that Scripps Clinic 
administration has insti-
tuted its own internal 
investigation ' to determine 
the circumstances leading 
to the theft of the boxes.

Staff Writer 

Sexual harassment is a problem at 
UCSD and Mary Linn Hughes claims she 
is doing something about it. 

Hughes, a visual arts graduate student, 
is currently circulating a questionnaire to 
students, faculty and staff to "determine the 
extent of the problem." 

She wants to bring the issue of sexual 
harassment out in the open and destroy the 
myths which surround it. 

Sexual harassment, according to 
Hughes' questionnaire, is "unwanted 
sexual attention from a male who is in a 
position to control, i~f1uence or affect a 
woman's job, career or grades (and) uses 
his authority and power to coerce the 

woman into sexual relations, or punish her 
refusal. " 

Such harassment can also take the form 
of a suggestive comment or more 
aggressive "touching, pinching , or 
patting," the questionnaire says. 

"It is a form of violence against wOp1en," 
says Hughes, who believes that it is "an 
issue of power, not sex." 

There are many similarities between 
sexual harassment and rape; and people 
must recognize that it is a problem, Hughes 
says. 

Sexual harassment "is not only confined 
to students - it is a problem that cuts 
across all of the hierarchies to the students, 
faculty, tenured professors, and secretaries 
in the offices," she says. 

Board of Overseers to Disband 
When McElroy Leaves in J'une 

Chancellor William McElroy will 
dUlband the Board of Overseers when he 
leaves office in June. . 

That decision, announced last week, 
meana the end of a community adyisory 
committee to the univerlity that the 
chancellor founded when he took office 
eilht yearl ago. 

l'he elimination of the Board will take 
place, McElroy layl, becaUie he doesn't 
want "to saddle the new chancellor with my 
board." 

McElroy expects, however, that the new 
chancellor w~1 reconstitute the Board in 
whatever form i. llUitabie to him or her. 

"You need community input on a lot of 
iuuell," the chancellor told the La 10lla 
Light. 

The 39-member Board, which has been 
in existence for SIX yearll, has been one of 
the chancellor's lttrongest and most 
consiatent linka tJ the community, and has 
backed McElroy on several university 
iauea. including ~ McEiroyAcademic 
Senate cln~:h '~ht May and personnel 
policies at the University Hospital. 

'The board il>lmed a statement of support 
duriflK the Senate confrontation which 

I"\'(/~\' lum I" 1m Ill' X 
" 

Sexual harassment is "o ften 
trivialized and joked about," 
says Hughes, who believes that it 
is "used as a power to keep women in their 
place." . 

These attitudes persist because women 
who get harassed are often silent, Hughes 
says. "If they don't complain to their 
supervisors, then their supervisors tend to 
think that there is no problem," she says. 

"People just don't talk about it. " As long 
as this harassment goes on, "equal 
opportunity will continue to be a fantasy, " 
she says.

Oil, Leak Is Stopped, 
But Cause Still Unknown 

By Risa lee Podolsky 
Staff Writer 

The fuel oil tank near Revelle campus is no longer leaking, but it 
won't be fully drained allowing campus offici~ls to tell why it leaked, 
until January. 

"The tank no~ has about 40,000 gallons of oil in it, and we 
pumped about 40,000 gallons and used that instead of natural 
gas," sayli Thomas Tribble, Construction and Buildings 
Operations Supervisor. 

"The leak is definitely in the top half 01 the tank. It's not leaking 
" now. 

The cal1)pus. which is usually powered by natural gas, was being 
run by fuel oil in an effort to drain the tank during the early part of 
November, according Tribble. 

"Then we let it stand for a week to ob ervl' it. and it didn't leak."

City Hall Still Mourns Moscone, Milk 
By David N. Ro.enthal 

Dianne Feinstein won't sit in the chair where George Moscone 
was shot. AMe Kronenberg gets depres!oed the 27th of every 
month. And everyone remembers. 

They remember the day San Francisco turned ugly. The day 
gunfire rang beneath the rotunda. The day a mayor and a 
supervisor died. 

It was a year ago that Dan White, freckle-faced former 
Inman and police officer, walked into Mayor Moscone 's city 
hall office and shot him because he wouldn't give White his 
supervisor's job back. It's been a year since White reloaded his 

David N. Rosenthal ;s a writer for the Associated Press. 
gun, ran down the hall and shot Supervisor Harvey Milk 
because he smirked. . 

For thit> city, still reeling then from the horror of the deaths 
from its own in faraway Jonestown, Guyana, the assassinations 
of it. mayor and it. first avowed homosexual official last Nov . 27 

. were almost more than could be borne, Now the pain has eased. 
State Assemblyman Willie Brown, perhaps George 

Moecone's c10aelit friend, says it is impossible to scar the city . 
San Francisco is too resilient, he says, too full of life t.o be 
obees.ed, even with the death of loved ones. Perhaps he'li right. 
As one sits in the mayor's office, the place Moscone·loved ~o 
well, talking to his successor, music wafts through the window· 
gaiety from the same plaza where thousands ga thered to mourn 
Moacone and Milk and six months later came to rage against

White and the justice he' received. 
"Only time eases the blow," says Dianne Feinstein, whom fate 

made mayor and who now campaigns to win the office in her 
own right. "There are constant reminders - every time I walk in 
the back office, for example . I don 't sit in the chair Mayor 

Mos~one was in. 
"The memories are all around, as well they should be. They 

were men of such enormous personal humor and good will ." 
The politics o( George Moscone and Harvey Milk have 

receded from the mind's eye, but the memory of the men lingers. 
"The movement has felt Harvey's loss this year," ,said Anne 
Kronenberg, Milk's administrative assistant. " And it's felt 
George's . They were two liberal forces lost at once and no one 
has really replaced them. 

" But the thing that really gets me is not being able to share 
things with Harvey , to have him to talk to. I see flashes of 
Harvey all the time . The 27th of every month is very difficult for 

" me . 
For Frank Falzon, a homicide detective who considered Dan 

White a friend, the hard part is second· guessing - by others and 
by himself. 

It was his seemingly sympathetic interrogation of White that 
became the turning point of White's trial , helping persuade a jury 
that White was not a cold·blooded killer , but a good guy gone 
wrong. 

"I remember everything that day vividly, every second is quite 
clear," Falzon says. "I've gone over it in my mind many times, 
wondering if I could have done anything differently. "There was 
absolutely nothing I could change. I didn't have all the answers 
when I spoke to Dan White to do a complete, 100 percent job. I 
wish I had; but that's Monday morning quarterbacking," 

There's been a lot of that since the May 21 verdict. which 
found White guilty of voluntary manslaughter, and the riot it 
provoked . 

But the man whose courtroom skill kept White from a murder 
conviction has no doubts . 

" I feel to this day that I just did a job for him like I'd do if 
Harvey Milk had shot and killed the other two fellows. I'd have · 
done the same thing for him and been jUl,t as satisfied with the 
outcome," says Doug Schmidt, White's attorney. 

"There was substance 10 our defense and I don't feel 
responsible for what happened afterward..." 

Schmidt's client walli lentenced to seven years and eight 
month. in prison. He is now at Soledad , living in a six·by·nine-
foot cell away from the prison population and waiting for 
freedom - perhaps as early a .. 1984 and no later than 1986.

NEWS BRIEFS 

Embassy Wired to 
Explode, Captors Say 

UNITED NATIONS - Islamic militants in Tehran said 
yesterday that they have rigged the US Embassy to blow up on 
command, and the Iranian armed forces were placed on full alert 
as Tehran was swept up by rumors of US military action to save 
49 hostages still in the US Embassy. -

The militants said they were especially concerned about 
"provocations" Thursday and Friday, the emotional Moslem holy 
days of Tasua and Ashura, when devout Moslems here whip or 
cut themselves to signify their willingness to become martyrs. 

In other developments on han yesterday: 
- UN Secretary General Kurt Waldheim appealed to the US 

and Iran at a Security Council to "avoid i:\IIIy action which could 
inflame" the crisis between the two nations. Only Waldheim and 
Council president Sergio Palacios addressed the Council before it 
adjourned for the day. 

- A team of doctors headed by a Canadian radiologist has 
removed the remaining gallstone from the deposed shah, but 
wants to keep him under observation in New York for "the next 
few days ," a Cornell Medical Center official said, 

- Three young American women is Tehran said they 
endorsed the occupation of the embassy and said the 49 hostages 
should be tried as spys. "If they are not spys, they should certainly 
welcome a public trial," one of the women said. 

- Rightest California state senator John Briggs said he would 
file a laws~it today requiring the state to halt what he claims is over 
$13 millions in financial aid to Ira nian students. 

"The 'california Education Code does not require the 
acceptance of alien non-immigrant students into the California 
school system," Briggs told the As~ociated Press. " If you 

limmigrate here, that's one thing. But these people haven' t 
immigrated. "

Area Cost of Living Up Little in 
October, Half of National Rate 

LOS ANGEl ES (AP) - Southern 
California had ita eIoweat month 01 price 
ina ... fow 1979, with the monthly 
conamer price index Ihowm,. hike 01 0.5 
percent for October. . 

~t comparea with a I percent rile for 
conlUmer pricel nationwide. Labor 
Department official. in Walhington 
attribull!d the gain to the sharpest rise in 
houainIr coats in three decadea. 

In l.Q. Angeles, lAbor Department 
lpOkeaman Jim Wurth said it was "a pretty 
borint month" for the local price index. 

During the first 10 month. of 1979, 

Sexual

The purpose of the questionnaire, which 
was sent to UCSD students, .taff and 
faculty, is to find out how widespread thi. 
problem ii, Hughes say •. The aiUrvey alb. 
questions, .uch as "Have you e~ienced 
sexual harassment here at UCSD?" with a 
Ii.t of possible reaponsea, iUCh al "verbal 
haraa.nent or abuse, sexilt 'remark. about 
a woman'. clothing, body or sexual 
activities," and ''leering or ogling at a 
woman'. body." 

Huahea wanta to take the results of her 
questionnaire and "give them back to the 
public" to "destroy the myth." concerning 
lexual haraumenl. 

Examples 01 myth. include "mature 
women can hancle it," or "it is somehow 
your fault" if you are haralled. She saYI 
U hope. her work on thil illue wiD

price. have rilien locally 12.5 percent, 
Wurth said. In 1978, the increase was 7.3 
percent for the same period. 

"It was the lowest of inc::reaseli for any 
month this year," Wurth said. 

Food and beverage., up 0.8 percent, 
and housing and medical care, both up 0.6 
percent,lec:f the categories in cost increasel 
lor Southern Calilornia. 

. The 0.5 percent increase in October 
meanl the purchasing power of the doUar is 
now 45.1 cents, compared to ib; value in 
196 7, when the Labor Deparbnent Itarted 
the index. 

In Washington, official. said rapidly 
ri.ing pricea for energy throughout the 
nation uowed significantly during October, 
and food price increasea showed a modest 
slowdown. 

But moderation in thOIlie areas was of/set 
by a 1.5 percent jump in hOUling prices -
the llteepelit monthly increase since 1947. 

Wittman To 
Get Recount 
SAN DIEGO (AP) - Attorney Steve 

Wittman, who fell 198 votes short of 
election to the City Council, i. asking for 
an official recount of the Nov. 6 election 
results. 

The move apparently won't affect the 
inauguration Monday of winner Mike 
Gotch. City Clerk Charles G. Abdelnour 
aaid, "AI far as I'm concerned, he i~ the 
legally dected cOWlCilman." 

WittmaM .aidf Monday that he wanta 
the vote counted again in 90 selected 
precincts or about 10 percent of the total. 
It'. doubtful any margin 01 error would 
change the results, Abdelnour said. ' 

Wittmann aaid he made the deciaion "at 
the urging of my supporters." 

Students Paid Late 
Continue(/ hum {KI/.IC!. I 
two quartera." 

According to Suicott, faculty 
and staff checks are IOrnetimes 
late too, but due to hiring dates and 
payroll cycles, their problema 
come at other times of the year. 

"Thia year we had other 
probiema that prevented all of the 
student employeea from being paid 
on time," said Suicott. He cited a 
computer breakdown during 
Auguat and September, a 13 
percent across·the·board pay 
increase that required additional 
form processing, and the 
installation of a new timekeeping 
syatem. 

Walker agrees with Suicolt's 
explanation that long lead time 
and a audden inHux of new student 
employees cause a lot of problems 

for the fall pay perioda. "But," !laid 
Walker, "except for .the delay this 
year because of the new 
timekeeping system, there has 
been a ateady improvement in 
payroll service since 1977." 

Suicott said that payroll staff 
have been working many houra of 
overtime to get the payroll checks 
out on time. 

Suicott explained that because 
of unemployment insurance 
requirements, COlit factors and the 
lack of a formal budget allocation 
lor the coming year, prohibita the 
retention of student employment 
recorlb on the computer through 
the summer. "But," he said, 
"hopefully, we'll have our own • 
central · processing system within 
one·and·a·hall to two years that 
will result in only about a 5.dav 
lead time 

Oil Lea~. Still Confusing 
Continued from page I 
It's not leaking now, and it's not hurting anyone." 

The remainder of the oil will be burned "when the Midwest and 
East Coast need oil, and our supplier diverts oil from the Sunbelt. 
The university is among the lirst of SDG&E customers to be cut 
off," Tribble said. -

He said thia usually happens around January. 
When that happena, the tank will be used lor its original purpose, 

a reaerve power supply. After the oil is used up, the tank will be 
investigated to bee why it leaked, cleaned and repaired. Until then, 
says Tribble, the university won't know why it was leaking oil. 

"It's an economic trade·off. We could rush in and drain the tank, 
but it would cost the university about $20,000 we don't need to 
spend. Fuel oil is about twice as expensive ag natural gall." 

If the tank starts leaking again, which Tribble thinkii is unlikely, 
"we'l have to change plana. It's being monitored on a daily basis, 
10 we 11 know if it starts leaking." 

The sewer line into which oil leaked for a few days has been 
repaired, he says.

Every Film a Gem 

Animation Festival Wondrously Moving 
By Beth Haaa 

Amazingly enough, almost 
every film from the Felltival of 
Animation shown here this 
weekend left lOme sort of 
indelible impression on the 
audience. These weren't just 
high.quality cartoons to sit 
back and enjoy - they were 
films to cry over, reflect on, 
wonder about and absorb. 

The most disturbing of them 
was Mechanical Crabs from 
Czech06l0vakia. It begins with 
an old general and his . 
assistant marooned on a 
deserted plain by a helicopter 
(adorned with skull and 
crossbones) trying to develop 
an army of crabs. They begin 
by having one reproduce itself 
through eating" a couple biteji 
from a small metal rod. This 
one makes two crabs, these 
two give birth to four and so on 
until the whole lot of them 
march off to destroy the world. 
Something inexplicably goes 

wrong, however, and the crabs 
turn ,,~ {>ach other and eat 
themselve~. From this 
skirmish, different crustracean 
forms develop until one huge 
crab ill left alone with the men . 
He turns on his initial creators, 
tortures and kills them, and 
finally !>eU·destructs. Only 
after the end, sitting there in 
the dark, is it obvious that the 
crabs are analagous to 
modern weapons. 

Another strong film, 
(surprisingly enough, since it 's 
simply a succession of 
charcoal drawings,) is Men in 
the Park by George Geertsen 
of Canada. The scenes show 
despondent, tired, rejected old 
men, some drunk or crippled, 

~huffling around in an 
anonymous city park. This 
film leaves the audience 
heartsick, feeling cold and 
maybe a little ashamed. 

The Box is warm, 
delightful film with adorable 

Jazz bU.II John- ·Lelwich will appear at the Stratford 
Studio/Theater on Dec. 2.

characters. A cute little man 
has a small, black box, the 
contents of which must be kept 
secret. He comes out of the 
rain into a bar, where, after 
bribes and repeated cajoling, 
he allows a man to look in~ide. 
The man is terrified by the 
contents and runs off 
screaming. This attracts a 
buxom blonde who slyly 
seduces the little man into 
allowing her to peek inside. 
She is strangely disgusted by 
the contents. Later, a mild· 
mannered female shyly 
approaches the little man and 
shows that she, too, has a little, 
black box. After apprehension 
and caution from both parties, 
they hesitantly slide their 
boxes together. Everything 
ends well and the two go 
tripping merrily off into the 
rain, carrying their boxes , and 
climb aboard an ark. 

Special Delivery is an 
outstanding film, sharp with 

humor by Eunice McCauley 
and John Weldon. It lasts only 
seven minutes, but is a 
developed, complex story of 
Ralph, victim of the Letter 
Carriers Union bureaucracy 
after a mailman slips and dies 
of a brdken neck on Ralph's 
unswee.t , snowcovered front 
walk . This film artistically and 
craftily pokes fun at this and 
other select special interest 
groups. 

Animation Potpourri (pts. 
1 and 2) is simply a collection 
of cute, animated commer· 
cials. It. was carelully situated 
in the program to provide a 
breather between the filma. 

SlIsiphus, a film by Marc 
Jonkouics of Hungary, 
produced from the myth by the 
same name, is an exceptional. 
Iy strong, vivid portrayal 01 a 
man pushing an incredibly 
hea vy rock up a hill. Though 
the scenes are pen.and·ink 
drawingll, Jonkouics makes 

the man seem real and alive 
with his muscles flexing, and 
his body laboring with each 
breath . The audience ia left 
leeling exhau~ted. 

Will Vinton, with hia 
academy award.winning film 
Closed Mondays, communi· 
cates the emotiona 01 a lonely, 
drunk man wandering · 
aimlessly around an art 
museum. The man, in his 
drunken stupor, talk" to lOme 
paintings, and see. other 
graphics come to lite and 
dance and play in front 01 hi. 
eyes. After "sparring" with a 
"meta morphologically mu· 
tated computer", the man 
stumbles onto a platform and 
is him..elf bronzed into a statue 
for the museum. The feelings 
of loneliness and ialoation are 
overwhelming. 

Everything about the 
Festival of Animation, a 
Mellow Manor Promotion, is 
superb. 

'Police' Are Your Friends 
By Barry AlfonlO 
Contrib~ting Editor 

Despite their authoritarian 
name, there's nothing very 
pushy or assertive about the 
Police, the British regg.ae·rock 
trio who performed at the Cjvic 
Theater on Tuellday, Nov. 
20th. Mixing several musical 

styles, the band projects an 
unfocused image on stage, 
though its lead singer is 
perlOnable and their songs 
better than average. During 
their San Diego show the 
Police· were enjoyable, though 
not (excuse me) arresting, 
entertainment. 

Around Town 
A collection of oil paintingll and drawings by artist Jim 

Randall will ~ on exhibit iQ the Mandeville Annex Gallery from

Wonten's Basketball Begins Atnbiguously, 
By Jan Goetz

The women'. ba.ketball 
team aplit a pair of games at 
the AlI·CaI tourney at UC 

• Davi. lut weekend, in their 
fint action after nearly two 
month. of practice, 

Despite the 11 pointa of 
Stacie Macfadyen and the 10 
of Dani Grady, the Triton. 
only shot about 25% from the 
fiekf in their lint game again.t 
Santa Barbara, UCSB won 
the game 62·47, sending the 
Triton. into the loser'. bracket 
of the tournament. 

UCSD received a bye on the 
next round, then beat Santa 
Cruz 58·44 for a fifth place 
fini.h on the weekend. Mary 
Egan and Wendy Nakayama 
teamed for over half of the 
Triton'. !lints, with 18 for 
Egan an 12 for Nakayama. 

1M fact that four different 
players scored in double 
figure. during the tournament 
poinb out the depth of talent

Nakayama, a 5'3 freshman 
guard, "has a very nice outside 
shot," according to her coach . 
She could be that high scorer 
several times during the year. 
Another small freshman 
guard, Gioia Meuinjer;could 
bring some new hustle to ,the 
team. The 5'2 guard came to 
UCSD after playing on the 
Bolivian junior national team. 

Hustle and stamina are two 
qualities in demand on this 
year's squad. The team runs 
an exhausting man:to-man 
defense and a quick moving 
shuffle offense, 

Malone warns that running 
the man·to·man coverage 
means players have to be in 
good condition . "You can only 
play eight minutes before you 
run out of gas ," she said, To 
prepare, th!! team has been 
~fting weights and condition· 
ing since the early weeks of the 
quarter. Also, with eight 
returning prayers and four 
treshmen , the team has qua lity 
backups at every position. 

The team runs three 
offenses , all based on the man· 
to·man coverage that has 
come to dominate women's 

basketball these days. All rely 
on a solid passing game and 
picks away from the ball. 
Much of the shooting comes 
from underneath the basket, 
though the team may ha ve to 
take more outside shots 
against a zone defense. 

A new league waits for (ht! 
Tritons this year. Last year 
they competed in a league with 
higher caliber schools, and 
en'ded up with a losing record. 
"This year we're looking for 
more equitable competition," 
says Malone .

Men Turn Over Squeaker To 
Redlands, Lose 20-Point Lead 

By Barbara Haas 
Staff Writer 

The basketball team handed the University of 
Redlands a one point victory Friday when 18 
second·half turnovers eroded a sixteen po int 
lead . 

The T ritons were up by ten a t half time, after 
leading twice by as many as fou rteen and once 
by twenty points. Coach Ron Carte r was pleased 
with the way the contes t was going up to until the 
end, a nd said that "We just gave the game a way 
in the last seven minute~. We committed thirty 
turnovers in the whole game, and 18 to their six 
In the second ha lt." 

Carter blamed th~ breakdown on a lapse in 
menta l concentration. The cagers dominated 

mo~t of the game, and for 15 minutes played 
. wha t Carter called "awesome basketba ll . 

Awesome basketball is when a team controls 
every aspect of the game - good running, good 
passing, great defense, good scoring. If we can 
just increase tha t 15 minutes into about 20 or 30, 
then we'll sta rt winning some more games." 

Se vera l UCSD pl a yers , however, d id

demonstrate plenty of depth against Redla nds. 
Gary Haynes, a 6'5 forward , made seven field 
goals for the team high of 14 points. Stan 
Hopper, a senior returnee, put in five baske ts and 
a free th row to add 11 more , and Anthony Filer 
contributed 10 points. 

T he Tritons will be back in act ion in the UCSD 
gym Friday a nd Sa turday at the La Jolla Classic
