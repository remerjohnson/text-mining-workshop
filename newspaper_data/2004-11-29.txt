Congress approves financial aid 
changes, flat Pell Grant awards 

By SHANNON EUOT 
Senior Staff Writer 

Students depending on federal 
financial aid may have to find 
other means of paying tuition 
costs next year as a result of a Nov. 
20 bill passed by Congress. 
Education advocates say it will 
shift a higher percentage of col-
lege costs to students and their 
families. 

While ,the bill provides an 
overall $1.4 biJIion increase in 
federal aid funds for a total of $57 
billion to the U.S. Deparonent of 
Education, the average amount of 
individual student aid is expected 
to decrease. Due to increasing 
demand, the maximum Pell Grant 
award will remain at $4,050 for 
the third consecutive year, despite 
a $458 million increase in the pro-
gram's funding and rising univer-
sity expenses. 

As many as 1.2 million stu-
dents couJd see their Pell Grants 
reduced and 85,000 of the 5.2 mil-
lion currendy eligible students 
could lose them completely under 
the bill, according to the 
American Council on Education. 

By passing the federal appro-
priations bill H.R. 4818, Congress 
allows the Department of 
Education to adjust its formula in 
determining qualifications for 
financiaJ aid, a move that lawmak-
ers bloclred last year. The award-
ing of 6nancia1 aid is currently 
based on 1988 state income tu

from 17 -year old data, when tax 
rates in many states were much 
higher than they are now. In 
updating the tables, the 
Depamnent of Education would 
ask families to pay more toward 
college than they are now because 
it would appear, under the formu-

la, they are paying less in taxes. 
The government's indepen-

dent Advisory Committee on 
Financial Assistance estimated 
that the move will save the Pell 
Grant program and the 
Department of Education close to 
$300 million per year.

J,Board backs council in APSA complaint 
Warren council did not violate bylaws, 5-2 decision finds 

ByUSAMM 
AssociIte News Ecfltor 

By a vote of 5-2 on Nov. 23, 
the Earl Warren College Judicial 
Board ruled that the Warren 
College Student Council's deci-
sion to fund the Nov. 13 Asian 
and Pacific-Islander Student 
Alliance high school conference 
did not violate the WCSC's 
financial bylaws, restoring $150 
worth of funding for the organi-
zation's event. 

On Nov. 8, Warren CoUege 
Senator Matt Herrick filed a 
grievance against the council, 
charging that the council had vio-
lated its own constitution and 
bylaws by funding the APSA 
eveRt. 

'The conference benefits disad-van. lUsh ICbooI students by 
addressing questions and concerns 
regarding higher education, acc0rd-
ing to the APsA canstitution. 

In Herrick's opinion, the con-
ference should nOt haft received 
fundin, because it did Dot 
directly benefit Warren stu-
dents. The judicial board pant-

ed Herrick a preliminary injunc-
tion, freezing aUocations for the 
conference. 

In its decision, the judicial 
board stated that an event should 
be considered as "benefiting the 
Warren community" if even one 
Warren student received a direct 
or indirect benefit. 

During his testimony in the 
Nov. 18 case hearing, APSA 
Cultural Director and Warren 
sophomore Joseph Ramirez 
described the leadership experience 
he received through participating 
in the conference. 

According to the board's deci-
sion, Ramirez's testimony was suffi-
cient proof that the event provided 
a benefit to at least one Warren stu-
dent. 

"We refuse to establish a crit-
ical mass of Warren students a 
program must benefit before it 
qualifies as benefiting Warren 
students," the board stated in its 
decision. "The central purpose of 
this prop'IJIl may DOt be to ben-
.fit Warren itUdeotl, but 
nowhere in the ..,.... doe. it 111 
that this is requiftcI. It only ..,. 

that the event must benefit 
Warren students, irrespective of 
what the program's central pur-
pose is." 

The decision also emphasized 
the board's opinion that the 
APSA conference provided a 
benefit for the whole UCSD 
community. • 

"We affirm that programs such 
as this one and outreach in gener-
al clearly and unequivocally bene-
fit the campus community," it 
stated. 

In a dissenting opinion, Warren 
College Judicial Board member 
Dmitriy Bronin argued that the 
conference did not provide any 
benefit to the Warren community. 

"I also advise the Warren 
CoUege Legislative CounciJ not 
to fund programs pertaining to 
social services and thus not bene-
fiting the Warren community; if 
you choose to fund such pro-
grams, revise or clarify the by-
Ins that guide your decisions," 
Bronin stated.

Pension plan in need of 
funding, UC report says 

University may consider mandatory 
employee retirement contributions 

By BENJAMIN IAllTLETT 
Staff Writer 

Assets in the University of 
California's retirement plan grew 
$3.9 billion last year, thanks to 
returns on investments, a financial 
evaluation by the university has 
found. However, despite the 14.5-
percent gain in market value, the 
report predicted that the retire-
ment plan would require add itional 
funding from the university within 
the next several years. 

"If liabilities and investment 
returns continue along their cur-
rent trend lines, then at some point 
in the future, our investment rev-
enue will not be able to cover all of 
our liability," UC Office of the 
President spokesman Noel Van 
Nyhuis stated in an e-mail. 

Created in 1961, the plan pro-
vides retirement income to eligible 
UC staff and beneficiaries. Over 

the last 10 years, it has been main-
tained through the revenue gener-
ated from its investment assets, 
which currently total around $39.2 
billion. 

"Due to the careful manage-
ment and strong performance of 
the university's retirement invest-
ments, UC faculty and staff have 
not had to contribute to the univer-
sity'S pen ion plan for more than a 
decade," Van Nyhuis stated. 

The report recommended tllat 
no employee contributions be 
made this year as well; however, it 
also projected that the retirement 
system will begin losing money 
within the next several year . 

This is because, despite the 
solid gains of last year, total gener-
ated revenue has been les than 
expected over the last five years.

Judge rejects recount 

request in mayoral race 
A presiding judge declined to grant a 

request brought by the San Diego League of 
Women Voters to require the county's Registrar 
of Voters to count originally discounted ballots 
in the city's mayoral race. 

The group had asked the courts to force the 
registrar to count several thousand ballots on 
which voters had written in a candidate but had 
not filled in the corresponding "write-in" bub-
ble. Most of the ballots were suspected to be 
for San Diego Councilwoman Donna Frye. 

Without the additional ballots, FPfe trails 
incumbent Mayor Dick Murphy by approxi· 
mately 2,500 votes, according to the most 
recent data released by the registrar. 

"Those of us who stand for the proposition 
that all votes cast should be counted suffered a 

setbac~' Frye stated in an announcement put 
out by her campaign. 

Despite the ruling, which the organization 
indicated it would not appeal, Frye praised the 
energy stirred by her unexpected write-in 
campaign. 

"In five short weeks, we accomplished what 
no one believed possible," she stated. "For our 
cause is more than a campaign about filling in 
bubbles - it is about giving a voice to a citi-
zenry that calls for an end to back-room deals, 
politics as usual and an attitude of govemment 
arrogance and entitlement:' 

The campaign also pointed to a private sur-
vet, conducted mid-November, giving Frye the 
most favorable opinion of all mayoral candidates 
among 100 polled voters. Though more respon-
dents also said they had voted for Frye, her lead 
was well within the poll's margin of error. 

The registrar will announce the official 
winner on Nov. 30. 

Playboy launches contest 
for college photographers 

Citing its role in showcasing the work of the 
finest photographers, the publ isher of Playboy 
magazine has launched a new college contest to 
find "the next great photographer:' 

As a part of its third annual College Nude 
Photography Contest - open to full- or part-time 
college students - the company has asked pho-
tographers to submit at least 10 "tasteful female 
nudes: according to a company statement. 

"Submissions should be visually innovative -
a creative new take on Playboy's trademark style 
of photographing beautiful women: it stated. 

A single winner will receive $500, have his 
or her work published on the magazine's Web 
site and be flown to the company's Chicago 
headquarters for "an in-studio photography 
session with a Playboy model."

Alzheimer's center receives 
$4 million gift from trustee 

UCSD Foundation Trustee and member of 
the UCSD Board of Overseers Darlene Shirley 
has awarded, jointly with her husband, a $4 
million gift to support the campus' Alzheimer's 
Disease Research Center. 

The ~ift was announced in conjunction with 
the Nalional Alzheimer's Disease Awareness 
Month. 

"This gift will enable us to continue to recruit 
the most talented clinicians and researchers to 
UCSD to further expand our patient care, clini-
cal trials and basic research efforts: depart-
ment of neurosciences chair and the center's 
director Leon Thai stated. 

Half of the gift will establish a rotating chair 
in the department that will fund Alzheimer's 
research by faculty members. The rest of the 
money will be used to fund start-up packages 
for new faculty, support research and pay for 
clinical trials at the university. 

College founded by Pat 
Robertson to dose 

Will iam Tyndale College, a private religious 
institution founded in Farmington Hills, Michigan 
by Christian broadcaster and activist Pat 
Robertson, has cited "a significant funding short-
fall" in a decision to close Its doors after Dec. 31 . 

"Tyndale deeply regrets that it is forced to 
cease offering Christ-centered undergraduate 
education: Tyndale Board Chairman Denis 
Root said in a university announcement. 'We 
understand, however, that God is sovereign, 
and that we must accept this closure action as 
being consistent with his will." 

The university first faced similar financial 
problems and a potential closure last spring. 
when it received an additional $2 million in 
support. However, after an expected "substan-
tial increase" in student numbers did not mate-
rialize in fall 2004, the university decided to 
cease its operations. 

Researchers find new data 
about deadly tsunami 

A group of researchers that included sci-
entists from the Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography and UCSD have uncovered 
new information about a 1946 tsunami while 
exploring the seafloor off the coast of Alaska. 

Their findings may cause modelers to 
rethink the cause and characteristics of the 
tsunami, which killed more than 150 people 
and caused widespread destruction on coasts 
between Alaska and Anarctica, according to 
Scripps researcher Tony Rathbum.

ACS cites technology, traffic in 
several Webmail service failures 

Plan: Pension's asset .. to .. liability 
ratio has fallen from 2000 level 

By SHANNON EUor 
Senior Staff Writer 

Despite a series of technical 
problems, including overwhelming 
demand, hardware limitations and 
software trouble, that resulted in the 
malfunction of the student e-mail 
system this fall, Academic 
Computing Services Director Tony 
Wood CClIltinues to vouch for the 

system~ dependability. 
Throughout fa)) quarter, system 

outages prevented students from 
accessing campus e-mail. 
According to Wood, there has 
only been one instance this quar-
ter of a malfunction in Webmail's 
main infrastructure. The problem 
occurred the morning of Oct. 26 
and was remedied by afternoon 
the next day. Wood attributed the 
problem to three primary causes, 
particularly the increased use of 
ACS Webmail, the update of soft-
ware relating to the Web server 
and hardware limitations. 

"Our usage statistics for compa-
rable weelcs this quaner and last 
fall show a 50 percent increase (in 
Webmail use!," Wood said. "We 
(also! installed a new version of the 
Apache http-server on ... Oct. 26. 
We expected this version to 
improve ACS Webmail perfor-
mance because of its improved 
(input and output) capabilities. 
The updated Apache processes use 
significandy more memory and ran 
into system limits very quickly 
under peak load conditions." 

Wood said that once the prob-
lem was identified, it was quickly 
fixed and the system was restored 
to its nonnal function. 

"We fixed (the problems) by 
tripling the memory installed in 
the (Webmail) server, aod .•. ser~ 

vice very quickly returned to nor-
mal," he said. 

Wood noted that since Oct. 27, 
three "back-end" portions of the 
service experienced ou~ affect-
ing the pop-mail systems used for 
accessing the e-mail server, but 
which appeared to the user to be an 
outage of the Webmail system. 

"These outages affected only a 
portion of the user population and 
have been for a variety of hard-
ware failures," Wood said. 
"Historically, all these systems 
have been reliable, and we believe 
the system, as a whole, will be reli-
able in the future." 

The outages came within sev-
eral months of the univenity's 
decision to establish e-mail as the 
official communication method 
with students. 

The new policy, announced by 
the office of the Vice Chancellor 
for Student Affairs Joseph W. 
Watson, indicates that university 
communications from administra-
tors may be sent ac1usively 
through students' e-mail. 

"Electronic mail has the poten-
tial to be a highly cost-dl'ective 
and timely medium for university 
officials to communicate messages 
to students," the policy states. 
"This is particularly true in com-
parison to paper mail. In order for 
the university to fully realize the 
cost savings and other benefits of 
electronic mail, it is essential that 
students attend" to messages that 
are sent to their official UCSD 
electronic mail address." 

WatsOn said that, while no steps 
have been taken to amend the cur-
rent . communications policy, 
administrative officials win remain 
attentive to future problems. 

"We try to be alert to difficul-

ties with any and all campus and 
university policies and regulations 
and the potential need for 
changes," Watson said. "We will 
monitor how this policy is working 
and make changes if warranted." 

Despite recent troubles, 
Watson said he remains confident 
that the ACS system is in fine 
working order. 

"Electronic systems, like all 
systems, including e-mail, experi-
ence and will aperience shut-
downs and delays," Watson said. 
"Imperfection is inherent in all 
human systems. As a consequence, 
our policies and regulations are 
designed to accommodate tempo-
rary problems in the delivery sys-
tems. In general, Web-based sys-
tems are faster, less costly and 
more reliable and documentable 
than the mail and paper. To date, 
the Web-based system has func-
tioned very weD at UCSD and (is) 
living up to expectations." 

Students said they were occa-
sionally frustrated with the diffi-
culty in checking e-mail, but also 
explained that they understood 
the limitations of technology. 

"I check my e-mail daily, and 1 
find it really frustrating if I'm not 
able to access it. However, as 1 only 
use my UCSD e-mail for universi-
ty-linked correspondence, I'm not 
that bothered by the intermittent 
problems," Revelle College junior 
Gillian Sidda1l said. "Ililce the fact 
that the university is using e-mail 
for correspondence. ... Sometimes 
though, for important information, 
1 think they should use the mail 
rather than e-maiI.aslpay more 
attention to letters than e-mails. "

However, UC Berkeley profes-

critic of the UC Board of Regents' 
handling of the retirement plan, 
said the university's. invesonents 
could have been managed more 
carefully. 

"UC had built up a huge sur-
plus by year 2000, and this has 

mostly vanished. ... Some blame 
can be laid at the regents and the 
consultant they picked at that 
time," Schwarn stated in an e-
mail. 

The university had previously 
kept its investment reports private, 
but Schwartz, the Coalition of

the system and the regents last 
year, compelling them to release 
documents relating to the universi-
ty's private equity invesonents.

Colleges need second look at financial rules 
By MARYANN KIMOTO 

Contributing Writer 

W ith colleges scrambling to pass resolutions in response to Htrrick v . . 
Warrm Colltgr Srudmt Council, 
one can' t help but re-evaluate Ea rl 
Warren College and its choice to

The controversy surrounding 
the ca e, in which Warren 
Freshman Senator Matt Herrick 
sought to halt Warren's allocation 
of $150 to APSA's 11th-annual 
high school conference, draws to 
the forefront the issue of colleges

brought some much needed 
scrutiny specifically to Warren 
College's funding practices. The 
case underscores both the arbi-
trary nature of Warren's funding 
process and the need to re~ rm its 
financia l bylaws. 

'vVCSC receives thousands of 
dollars in funding from its stu-
dents, and WCSC financial bylaws 
are meant to protect their rights. 
However, it's inevitable that 
Warren programs benefi t other 
UCSD students as well. Black 
Hall, an apartment complex locat-
ed in Warren, is almost entirely 
dedicated to all-campus housing, 
and its community shares in all the 
same programs ancl events as 
Warren students. Resident advi-
sors and staff in the Warren Office 
of Residcnrial Life aren't necessar-
ily from Warren College, but ben-
efit from and are in charge of vast 
co ll ege resources. Since students 
from all across campus have con-
tributed in part to Warren College 
and benetlted in turn , allowances 
should be made when funding 
reaches past students who are 
obviously Warrenites. A campus as 

partirioned as UCSD should not 
focus on the mere label assigned 
on college applications, but 
instead recall that UCSD is a com-
munity where resources should be 
put to work where they are needed 
most. 

Many other worthwhile pro-
grams funded by WCSC are also 
of little direct benefit to Warren 
students as a whole. For example, 
Warren's recent funding alloca-
tion to allow the UCSD Mock 
Trial team to participate in a 
regional competition benefits 
o nly a minority of Warren stu-
dents involved in this all-campus 
o rga ni za tion. However, like the 
APSA conference, the event 
greatly benefits the students who 
participate, allowing those mem-
bers to reach out [Q high school 
students or srimulate their minds 
through competirion . This pro-
vides just as much for students 
as barbecues and ' dances , 
regardl ess of college affilia-
tion . T he opportunity to 
serve and interact with the 
communi ty should actual-
ly be viewed as a much-
needed privilege, and an 
experience more pro-
found than a mere 
barbecue. What bet-
ter way to help 
Warren students, 
or any students for 
that matter, than to 
educate their very 
characters? After all, 
these are our future 
leaders and teachers. 

While the Judicial 
Board ultimately 
rejected Herrick's 
case, hi s initiative did 
hel p raise the question of 
Warren's funding - an issue 
that has been swept under the 
ca rpet for too long. 
Unfortunately, the ques-
tion broached during 
Herrick v. WCSC was 
not new. In the very 

first meeting of the 2004-05 
school year, a council member 
inquired about the limitations 
imposed by WCSC regarding 
funding, as financial bylaws were 
suspended the previous year on a 
regular basis to allow the council 
to sponsor external events . 
Revising Warren's ambiguous 
financial bylaws could have pre-
vented much of 
the hassle the 
council faced . 

Herrick v. 
WCSC 
isn't the 
o n I y 
problem 
the 
counci l has 
had with 

funding in recent years. Since it is 
the only college without funding 
caps, Warren has alternately been 
accused of over- and under-fund-
ing events and programs. This 
year, WCSC has struggled to 
achieve an apprupri ate level of 
expenditure, an especi~ Ily delicate 
matter given the passage of last 
year's 54/quarter student acrivity 
fee referendum. 

One example of Warren's inad-
equate funding mechanism is its 

lacle of adequate representa-
tion. A large number of coun-

cilmembers both 
appointed and elected -
are Warren residents. 
Earlier this quarter, Warren 

Student Activities 
Coordinator Brian Willess 

spoke at a WCSC 
meeting 

regarding 
the granting 
of funding 

request s 
dispro-

por-

tionately in favor of events bene-
fiting on-campus students versus 
commuters, despite the latter 
group being responsible for 
approximately 76 percent of refer-
endum-mandated WCSC income. 

Citing the veto of a commuter 
barbecue and the passage of larger-
scale residential programs, Willess 
reminded the council [0 keep all 
parts of the Warren community in 
consideration. Although steps have 
been taken to remedy this through 
the initialization of a Warren 
Transfer Commuter Commission, 
an event such as the APSA-spon-
sored high school conference is 
unfortunately exactly the type of 
event that would not specifically 
benefit on-campus Warren stu-
dents. 

Compared to the WCSC's 
income of $64,979 - including 
over 53,000 pledged to APSA-like 
external activities - the fuss gen-
erated over a compararively small 
amount of funds seems downright 
si lly. Instead of seeing thi s as a 
slight to outreach programmi ng, 
we should commend the system for 
allowing a single student to speak 
up and ask harcl questions about 
funding allocation . Right or 
wrong, Herrick was able to break 
the monotony of easy, po litically 
correct head-nodding, bringing 
the letter of the law to attentiun. 
As a result, Warren can now 
reform its bylaws accordingly or 
adjust its policy in the future . And 

while the Judicial Board may have 
sided with WCSC, the new fO"CD S 
on college constitutions and 
bylaws will hopefully cause stu-
dents all over campus to re-evalu -
ate some of the core issues of their 
colleges. 

Former Supreme Court Justice 
Earl Warren once said, "It is the 
spirit and not the form of the law 
that keeps justice alive," and in this 
case, it is the purpose of WCSC, as 
well as other student councils 
across UCSD, to aid not just one 
group of students, but all. 

Schwarzenegger copies thriving in Japanese polit~cs 
lost in 
Translation 

Daniel Watts 

Japan has its own Arnold Schwarzenegger. It might even have two. 
Governor Shintaro Ishihara , 

previously mentioned in this col-
umn, presides over Tokyo prefec-
ture, the largest "state" in Japan. A 
former pop novelist, he enjoyed a 
landslide victoty in his last re-elec-
tion campaign. Other than the 
obvious parallels - both are well-
liked former pop icons who govern 
their nation's largest state - there 
are the subtler, more controversial 
similariries as well. 

The far left has accused 
Schwarzenegger of racism; his dad 
was a Nazi long before Arnold was 
born, which is enough for some 
people to condelnn him. Ishihara's 
public statements are even better 
fodder for criticism; he's warned 
Japan's military to prepare for 
inevitable foreigner-led riots at the 
outset of a major earthquake. 

They're both green. The "hydro-
gen highway" Schwarzenegger 
wants to run through California is 
akin to Ishihara's quest to clean up 
Tokyo by modifying all city buses to 

run on hydrogen fuel. 
However, the most plausible 

Arnold clone inJapan isn't Ishihara. 
but the puffy-haired Prime Minister 
himself, Junichiro Koizurni. 

When first elected, he was even 
more popular than Arnold, with 
approval ratings above 90 percent. 
He promised to reform the govern-
ment, like Arnold. He said he would 
bring jobs back to the land, like 
ArnoJd. He came face-to-face with 
his political he.ir a couple of weeks 
ago, during the Terminator's "Taste 
of California" promorional tour. 

"You're very popular," 
Schwarzenegger said to Koizumi. 

"You too," the Prime Minister 
replied. "More popular than Bush." 

Well, duh. 
Back when Koizumi was the 

most popular Prime Minister in 
history, his " Liberal Democratic 
Party" sold over a million posters 
bearing his likeness . Between the 
LDP toenail clippers; Koizumi and 
LDP logo mugs; Koizumi plush 
dolls; "casual" Koizumi key chains 
(with the PM in a T-shirt and 
jeans); Koizumi and LDP stickers; 
Koizumi fans and countless videos; 
and books and pieces of kitchen-
ware about the LDP and Koizumi, 
the LDP has a profitable Koizumi-
centric business plan. Sadly for the 
LDP, however, the Koizumi busi-
ness has fallen on hard times in 
recent months, as the wild-haired 

leader's popularity has waned in the 
wake of his compliance with the 
U.S.-led Iraq war. 

Fortunately for touring political 
junkies, the declining popularity of 
the ruling party means that the 
LDP party office in Tokyo is chock 
full of these trinkets. At 70 yen 
each. the Koizumi posters are the 
cheapest thing in Japan, so I bought 
30 of them. With the U.S. dollar 
falling in value faster than 
Gameboys fly off store shelves, 70 
yen will soon be worth a dollar, so 
I'm going to get a head sllIn and 
budget money in tenns of Koizumi 
posters. For example: It costs 20 
Koizumi posters for train rides to 
Tokyo and back, my October phone 
bill was 85 Koizumi posters, and my 
trip to Hiroshima in two weeks will 
set me back a cool 357.14 Koizumi 
posters. 

When portra),ed as a canoon, 
Koizumi is dressed as a lion because 
of his wild mane of gray hair. This 
characteriution adorns stickers, 
key chains, T-shirts. hats and dolls. 
They're sold in the official parlia-
ment gift shop as well as the LDP 
office, giving the Koi2.inni personal-
ity cult that surreal sense of legiti-
macy that can only come with state 
spomorship. The plush dolls are 
labeled ·Shishiro," a combination 
of theJapanese word for lion, which 
remarkably few Japanese ltUdenu 
ICCIIl to know, and Koizumi's first 

name, JurUchiro. 
It's kind of like all the 

"Governator" souvenirs, except 
that Arnold dolls and Republican 
nail clippers aren't sold in the offi-
cial Capitol gift shop in 
Sacramento. 

Figuratively down the street from 
the parliament gift shop is the 
Yasulruni shrine, to which Koizumi 
pays homage every August on the 
anniversary of Japan~ surrender in 
World War II. The shrine com-
memorates all soldiers who served 
Japan, including 14 class-A WWII 
war criminals. His visits are a 50IITCC 
of endless aggravation in every other 
East Asian country - each of which 
was invaded and plundered by Japan. 

At first, it's easy for an outsider 
to excuse Koizumi's visits to a shrine 
dedicated to all soldiers who died in 
wars - not just war criminals, but 
everyone. It commemorates con-
scripted men, sailors, cooks, medics 
and kamikaze fighters. 

But after seeing the Yasulruni 
shrine museum, which is little more 
than militarist propaganda, it's not 
hard to see how the Chinese. 
Koreans and everyone else in Asia 
could be so angry about it. To 
them, Japan i. .till a lingering 
threat. It has nuclear reac:torI, one 
ol the largat militaries in the world 
and the planet's second-largest 
economy, Any hint of miIiariIm 
recall. painful memories. 

The museum blatantly lies about 
the Nanking massacre, claiming 
that the bloody slaughtering of 
thousands of Chinese flat-out did 
not happen. "The Alleged Nanking 
Massacre: Japan's Response . to 
Chinese Lies" is sold in the official 
museum bookshop, right next to 
toy daggers and postcards of fighter 
jets. The state of "ManchuJcuo," a 
puppet regime established after 
Japan invaded Manchuria, is por-
trayed as a legitimate nation, creat-
ed by "a coalition of four different 
races." The entire war in China is 
called "The China Incident." The 
museum exhibits claim Japan played 
a benevolent role in the Pacific the-
ater, eventually instigating ~ozens 
of independence movements 
around the world and inspiring 
leaders like Nelson Mandela and 
Mahatma Ghandi. 

Yes, the shrine to war gods claims 
that Ghandi was inspired by the war 
criminals deified there. Its sickening. 

What~ really disturbing, though, 
were the thousands of school chil-
dren and other youth at the shrine. 
They came on buses. They came 011 
trains. They came with their fami-
lies and teachers. Some trendy teen-
agers with Ugp and miniskirts, 
orange sunglasses and blond hair,

MONDAY, NOVEMBER 29,2004 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

IIJ I UTTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Nonscience majors 

important too 
Dear Editor: 

In the Nov. 18 article about 
overhauling outreach ["Lawmaker 
urges possible overhaul in out-
reachj. state Sen. Jackie Speier is 
quoted as saying, "We !mow that if 
you don't take algebra by the time 
you're in seventh grade, and you 
don't take calculus by the time 
you're in junior or senior year, you 
will not go on to the sciences ... And 
we know that the only jobs that are 
going to be worth their salt are 
going to be jobs that are math- and 
science-based. If we don't prepare 
our kids to take on those jobs, we 
will be outsourcing jobs." 

Since I came to UCSD, I've 
heard repeatedly that non-math/sci-
ence majors are all fluff and have no 
use whatsOever, and that the only 
reason people take those majors is 
because they are incapable of doing 
math/science. However, this is a 
matter of opinion with no factual 
fOWldation. First of all, I took calcu-
lus, physics, chemistry, and biology 
in high school and got As in every 
subject. However, in college, I chose 
to switch my major from computer 
engineering to polirical science 
because I was more interested in 
learning about law, politics and 
power than about l's, Os. To anyone 
who may say I switched because 
CSE was too hard, I conrinued tak-
ing CSE classes for fun. 

Second, it is also untrue that if 
you don't ta~ calculus in high 
school that you won't go on to the 
sciences. If that were true, then why 
do we have classes like math lOA or 
math 20A? If the only people who 
take them are science majors and 
people won't become science 

majors unless they talce calculus in 
hi~~,~noone~dbe 
taking those courses. Finally, the 
worst lie is that non-mathlscience 
majors can't get jobs or that the jobs 
that are non-mathlscience-based 
are brainless, useless, low-paying, 
low-level jobs. People who are in 
non-math/science careers can still 
be "worth their salt. " For instance, 
OUT society has tradi tionally held 
lawyers equal to doctors among the 
most respected, highest-paid pro-
fessionals. Moreover, who would 
run our government? 
We would be in total 
anarchy without

Feminism has 
changed with times 

Dear Editor: 
This letter is in response to the 

opinion column ["From bra-burn-
ers to Britney Spears," Nov. 18) by 
Robin Averbeck. I find it quite sad 
that a college-educated woman is 
so poorly informed about the his-
tory of feminism, and tlhat she 
believes Brimey Spears espouses 
contemporary feminist ideals. 

these non-
science/math jobs. 

Speaking of gov-
ernment, I found it 
extremely ironic that 
the above quote 
came from a politi-
cian. Last rime I 
checked, Speier's job 
has nothing to do 

This ridiculous 
warship of 

science/math above 
all else is an ignorant 
blindness to reality," 

with math or science. _ ~ie T5IO, warren 
Yet, she is rather college serior 

Feminism has 
reinvented itself 
rime and again 
in its fight for 
universal suf-
frage, for a 
woman's right to 
choose, for 
equal pay for 
equal work. 
Feminist tenets 
have adapted in 
order to be 
responsive to 
contemporary 
problems faced well-paid, respected 

and has more power 
than most mathematicians or scien-
tists will ever have. This ridiculous 
worship of science/math above all 
else is an ignorant blindness to real-
ity. I don't believe that any major is 
i.nherendy easier than another. 
Some people are bound to be better 
fat nonscience than science and will 
find nonscience courses easier. 
Likewise, som~ people are boWld to 
be better at science than nonscience 
and will find science easier. Ei ther 
way, every subject is important to 
our society. None of us would be 
better off having only science or 
only nonscience.

by women. It is not the anachro-
nistic form of acrivism the author 
claims it to be. 

If Averbeck had researched the 
history of feminism, she would have 
discovered tha tit is unlikel y bra 
burning ever took place. In fact, it 
was part of an agenda of misdirec-
tion by the media to paint feminists 
as angry and frivolous, a notion that 
has sadly carried through to today, 
according to Averbeck. She would 
have also found that sexual libera-
tion, while an integral part of the 
movement, was only one plank of 
tlhe feminist platform. Averbeck 
argues that women have succeeded 
in becoming sexually liberated and 
tlhat she herself has never felt "sexu-

ally repressed by patriarchal soci-
ety." She then contradicts herself by 
saying that she feds she cannot talk 
to a man at a party without others 
assuming she wants to sleep with 
him. This is exactly the implication 
of the patriarchal, sexist construc-
tions that she argues do not exist. 
Feminism is so much more than 
sexuality. Feminists work to remedy 
discrimination against minoriries, 
the disenfranchised and the eco-
nomically disadvantaged. 

If you would like to learn more 
about the current feminist move-
ment, please attend the Feminist 
Majority Leadership Alliance 's 
next meeting, Dec. 2 at 5 p.m., in 
the Irvine room on the second 
floor of Price Center.

Column:

record straight 

continued from page 4 
into the museum. Seeing them all , I 
have to wonder why they were 
there. Were they getting extra cred-
it in class) Were they paying atten-
tion to what they saw) 

It's one thing if the parents took 
their kids to show them what 110' !O 
do, to teac h them the word "pro-
paganda," or to help them brea k 
down the lies. I worry for the 
future if this isn't tile case; if, in 
fac t , the parents didn't bother to 
explalI1 that they weren't visiting a 
genuine museum, but instead a 
monument !O militarism. 

The adults \vho pray at the 
shrine have to understand what it 
represenrs. At first, it seems II1nol'U-
ous, but the attached museum doc_-
n't leave room for doubt - it 's eVIl. 

Not everyone sees it that way, 
since all those killed in action are 
interred there as gods. Every famI-
ly who lost a relative in a war will 
have a reason for visiting the shrinc 
besides militari m. This legitimatc 
feeling of grief and responsibility to 
honor the family is at odds with the 
shrine 's true objective: rewriting 
history . 

It's rime to rewrite thc hrine's 
history. Fix the bias in the museum 
and expel the war criminal_. If tht 
Mormon Church can eradic.ltc 
Hitler after posthumously bapti7-
ing him, the Shinto monks c;ln

Lots: Construction to increase parking demand 
cominued from page I 

100 percent occupancy in both 
our U A" faculty and "B" staff 
spaces, at peak usage," he stated in 
an e·mail. "This proposed reallo-
cation will provide some current 
parking relief in this area, and will 
provide for limited expansion to 
meet the needs of faculty and staff 
when buildings open early nen 
year." 

Earl Warren College students 
will be most heavily affected by 
the changes, according to Arovas. 
The committees proposal elimi-
nates all student parking spaces for 
lots closest to Warren college: Lot 
P502 will lose its 73 "S" spaces, 
while P51 0 will lose its 85 student 
spaces. 

The committee's proposal does 
little to take student interests into 
account, said A.S. representative 
to the committee Josh Martino. 

"Warren College, specifically, 
already has enough parking issues, 
as nearly 350 parking passes were 
issued to Warren residents this 
year and as it stands, less than 200 
[US" spots] are within close prox-
imity to the college," he said. 
"Once the reallocation occurs, 
there will be almost no "S" spots 
for Warren residents to park in, 
and they will be forced to park 
somewhere else on campus. 1 
understand the growth of faculty 
and staff due to the buildings 
being completed next year. 
However, I feel that, generally 
speaking, faculty and staff should 
have to use shuttles just like many 
other commuters at UCSD." 

While Aravas admitted stu-
dents will feel the brunt of the 
proposal, he said that professors 
should be a high priority in park-
ing changes. 

"The parking calculus work.5 
by assuming, if a student is late to 
class becllU5e of a parking situa-

tion, It Inconveniences that stu-
dent," he said. "However, if a pro-
fessor is late because of a bad park-
ing situation, it inconveniences 
2oo-some students. We have to 
make sure our professors have a 
place to park." 

To offset the projected loss of 
student parking spaces, UCSD 
consrructed 572 new US" spaces on 
East campus, Snee said. The com· 
mittee expects that the proposal 
will force resident students to park 
in Nonh campus lots, moving 
commuter students toward East 
campus parking lots, according to 
Arovas.

Services will be adding addi tional 
shuttle capacity on East campus 
routes to address the increased 
usage of parking lots this winter, 
Snee said. 

The committee also added two 
c311lpus-loop shuttles, which will 
run on the weekends from 9 a.m. 
to midnight in one direction 
around campus, according to 
Martino. These extra shuttles will 
reduce wait times at stops to 
approximately 10 minutes. 

UThese shuttles win serve the 
stUdents who store their cars in 
other parking spots, such as 
Gilman Structure or North park-
ing, aU week, and move them on 
weekends," Martino said. uThese 
shuttles will also serve any student 

who wishes to use it just to get 
around campus on the weekends." 

The current parking situation 
will be alleviated by the comple-
tion of several parking structures 
on campus, according to Arovas. 
Currendy, a parking structure 
located at the northwest corner of 
Hoplcins Drive and Voight Drive 
is scheduled to be completed in 
December 2006. Upon its com-
pletion, roughly 1,420 new spots 
will be created to serve students, 
staff and faculty. 

In addition, a plan to build 
another structure near Revelle 
College, or closer to the center of 
campus, is in development, 
Martino said. 

"The recommendation as to 
where that structure . should be 
built will be made during a future 
meeting," he said. "That struc· 
ture should hold roughly 2,100 
spaces, and is projected to be 
completed around September 
2008." 

The committee also plans to 
discuss improvements in the 
campus' CityShutde and San 
Diego's Metropolitan Transit 
System bus services offered to 
UCSD, which hopefully will ease 
the impacted campus parking, 
according to student college 
council TPC representative and 
Warren Freshman Senator Matt 
Herrick. 

"Not only do we need a more 
extensive shuttle system, but a 
City of San Diego transit system, 

. as well," Herrick said. "We're 
really displeased with it because 
it's not efficient, not on time and 
ends at inconvenient times as well. 
We hope to renegotiate the bus 
system so that students will have 
an easier time on campus."

Grants: Bill to cut aid to 1.2 million, groups say 
contin~d from page r 

During debate on the bill, Sen. 
Jon Corzine (D-N. J.) said that he 
expects the new formula to harm 
student financial aid. Corzine had 
offered an amendment to the bill 
forbidding the increases, but law-
makers later rejected his proposal. 

"We should be expanding oppor-
runities for college in America, not 
eliminating opportunities for stu-
dents to seek financial aid," CarLine 
said. "It is now clear to me that this 
was a backdoor attempt to cut fund-
ing from the Pell Grant program. I 
call on the president to rescind the 
rule and ensure that no students lose 
their Pell Grants. ". We need to 
expand opportunity in this counoy, 
not relegate it to only those who can 
afford it." 

However, Chairman of the 
House Education and Workforce 
Committee Rep. John Boehner (R-
Ohio) applauded the revision as a 
way to address the nearly $3.7 billion 
deficit in the Pell Grant program. 

"Continuing to use this outdat-
ed information could mean short-
changing eligible smdents and 
deepening the Pell Grant budget 
shortfall," Boehner stated in a pre s 
release put out by the committee. 
"If the administration decides to 
proceed with its original plans to 
stop the use of this outdated infor-
mation, it will have my strong sup-
port. If the department continues 
to use the 1988 tables, it's conceiv-
able the current Pell Grant budget 
shortfall will be deepened by hun-
dreds of million of dollars - and 
as a result, it may be many more 
years before Congress can again 
increase the ma'ximum Pell Grant 
award that goes to our nation's 
neediest smdents." 

In a letter to outgoing Secretary 
of Education Rod Paige, National 
AssooiatioD of Smdent Financial 
Aid Administrators President 
Dalla 'Martip ~sted that 
changB(, th es fOr the 
2005-06 academic year would vio-

, Plastinated' bodies hring provocative study 
to Orneric8, creeping out audiences nationwide 

BY MASHA DAY STAFF WRITER 

A nine-foot giant is among the first things that greet you as YOIl step inside the Body Worlds exhibit in the California 
Science Center in Los Angeles. The giant is in 
fact a "plastinated" human - with all its 

organs, bones and muscles exposed - that 
expands the cadaver to inhuman size. This is 

among the exhibit's 200 featured authentic human specimens, including 2S 
fully assembled plastina ted bodies, individual organs and body slices. 

Gunther Von Hagens, the creator of plastination, has successfully showed 
more than 1 S million people the complex workings of our bodies. maId~ this 
me most successful touring exhibition worldwide. In addition, the exhibit has 
become one of the most popular at the California Science Center, attracting 
more than 300,000 guests since its opening in July. The huge number of visi-
tors demonstrates the desire of the general public to learn more about the 
structure and functions of human bodies. Invented by Von Hagens at the 
Institute for Anatomy in Heidelberg, Gennany in 1978, plasrination is a very 
unique preservation process, created originally for medical education. The 
process replaces the natural fluids and fats in the body with reactive polymers. 
such as silicone rubber or polyester, which are initially moldable to allow the 
positioning of the bodies into their life-like poses. Plastinated organs and body 
slices have gained popularity as teaching and research aids in many medical 
institutions. In addition, plastina-
tion preserves the structure of the 
vessels and organs down to the 
microscopic levd, allowing them to 
be used for surgical preparation and 
pathological analysis. 

The fuJly assembled plastinates 
at the exhibit include a soccer play-
er's body, split open down the mid-
dle to reveal inner organs and mus-
cles, and posed in mid action with 
one hand catching the ball and the 
other holding his lungs, charred 
from smolcing. 

The multitude of plastinates 
reveal the inner workings of the 
body's various systems. The fully 
assembled plastina ted humans are 
posed in a variety of life-like poses: 
bicycling, running, sitting, walking 
and even a slcateboarder doing a 
handstand on his board. Each of 
these models highlights how the 
specific systems interact with one 
another in addition to demonstrat-
ing the effects of healthy and non-
healthy habits on the body, which is 
one of the aims of the exhibit. 

Until recently, the complexity of . 
the human body '~ the cardiovascu-' 
lar system, the brain, bone Struc-
ture, nervous system, etc. - was 
known only by medical students 
and physicians. The gener;tl public 
was allowed a basic view of their 
own bodies from skeletons and 
illus trations in encyclopedias, yet 
these gave only a simplified picture. 
Body Worlds presents those who 
come with profol.1nd insight into 
the structure and function of 
healthy and unhealthy bodies. The 
exhi bi t all ows visj tors to see the 
interconnectedness of muscles, 
organs and vascular systems to a 
degree that has never before been 
poss ible. The whole-body speci-
mens highlight various anatomical 
components thac are made visiule 
thro Jgh cut-away components. In 
effect, the body is dissected in a way 
mat a.lJows the viewing of many of 
the organs and systems that are nor-

mally hidden behind muscle and bone structures. 
The exhibit is divided into five sections, allowing visitors to see anatomy in 

a logical and fascinating way - which some compare to a three-dimensional 
textbook. It starts with the 5ke1et:al system followed by the locomotive system, 
the digestive system, the nerve and vessel systems, and ends with prenatal 
development. The exhibit provides insight into not only the structure of the 
body, but also the spatial reiatioDship& ~ «pns and various systems by 
themselves. One of the most fascinating models is a human figure composed 
only of blood vessel" showing the complexity of the vascular system. 
Diseased and healthy orpn specimens ditpIa)' hearts of patients that suffered 
infarc1s, artificial joints and IUIlJS blaekened by nicotine. The Science Center 
believes that the exhibit iDJpires new respect for the body and its incredible 
intricacy, while powerfully dispelling iporance of how our lifestyle choices 
.ffect our bodies. 

UCSO's pre-med &atemity Phi Delta Epsilon joined UCLA's chapter on a 
visit to the Body Worlds exhibit. "I'm glad I saw it as it was a once in a life-
time opportunity," Revelle College junior Deborah Oossick said. I4It changes 
the way you look at the hull1t1l body; after the exhibit, I see it as very mecha-
nistic." She explained that the exhibit made her aware of possible lifestyle 
choices. "I will never smoke," she said. "The IUDg with cancer was probably 
the thing that made the greatest impact ... 

Although the ahibit features ~, it is presented in an artistic fashion. 
The creation of a plastina ted body is 
a very scientific process, yet the dis-
play requires the mindset of a sculp-
tor who can envision his or her fin-
ished product from a slab of marble. 
The positioning is guided by both 

. aesthetic and anatomical concerns 
to create the most realistic pose and 
educational consideration. The 
plastinated model of the chess play-
er highlightS the scientific aspect of 
the anatomy by focusing on the ner-
vous system_ However, the posrure, 
which showII a person deep in 
thought, shows the artistic detail 
that is given to the models. Suoh 
nuances in the models creare an 
impression of artistry. 

"It is hard to appreciate the 
artistry behind the exhibit," Dossick 
said. "The human development sec-
tion was the hardest to handle and 
really made you aware these are real 
people on display." 

In addition, the exhibit is DOl: set 
up like a regular exhibit with blank 
white walls and severe lighting 
focused on the spec:imens. The 
walls instead are covered with 
appropriate quoteS from philoso-

~ aDd anatomical drawings from 
the 16th century.

Dt!ia vu theories still 
fascinate experts ~ I CROSSWORD 

Psychologists, professors offer 
opinions about phenomenon 

By DAN FLOREK 
Contributing Writer 

If you have ever wallced into a 
completely unfamiliar and strange 
situation and felt that somehow, 
somewhere in your life you had 
done it all before, then you have 
experienced deja vu. Deja vu, the 
strange feeling that one has been 
someplace or seen something 
before, is a bizarre mental phe-
nomenon that proves that the 
human memory can sometimes 
play tricks on itself. 

Because of its mysterious 
nature, psychologists and others 
have been fascinated with deja vu. 
Some claim that it is evidence of 
reincarnation, arguing that during 
deja vu the subconscious recog-
nizes an event that occurred once 
before in a person s former life-
time. Others defend their slcepti-
cism by arguing mat deja vu hap-
pens when a person experiences 

something for the second time 
after merely forgetting their first 
experience. But the plain truth is 
that deja vu is not only real, but is 
as normal and commonplace as it 
is mysterious. 

"Everyone reports having expe-
rienced deja vu at some point in 
their life," said professor Patricia 
S. Churchland, chair of the UCSD 
philosophy department. "In fact, I 
would be surprised if I met some-
one who told me that they had 
never experienced deja vu." 

And it's true. We can all prob-
ably remember a time when we 
thought that something loolced 
familiar, Icnowing for sure that we 
had never seen it before. 

"Memories are normally 
accompanied by a certain feeling 
of familiarity, Of Churchland said. 
"But the brain is an imperfect 
machine, and it has a lot of jobs to

Mixtas are a basic dish that only seem to be eaten in Guatemala 
and nowhere else. That's not to say this recipe is particularly 
strange or exotic. It's really JUSt a simple and economic way to put 
a savory twist on the old picnic favorite: the all-American hot dog. 
What is interesting is that no one else seems [Q have conceived of 
this interesting combination. All you have to do is substitute a 
corn tortilla for the bun, guacamole for the ketchup, and boiled 
cabbage for the onions and relish. Although each item on this list 
is available ready-made at your everyday supermarket, a home-
made guacamole is crucial to the recipe.

A casual atmosphere, low prices and great 
food are the main ingredients students look 
for, especially in La Jolla. The following 
restuarants offer all this and are convenient-
ly located near UCSD. 

DON CARLOS TACO SHOP 
737 Pearl St., Ste. 113, LaJoOa 

While the assortment of authentic 
Mexican food is plentiful in San Diego, this 
taco shop diversifies its menu by serving 
many vegan and vegetarian dishes. Their 
authentic Mexican dishes include 
chimichangas, burritos, tortas and enchiladas 
with a vegetarian version of each, which also 
substitutes potatoes for meat. The vegetari-
an burritos offered include mushroom-tofu, 
black bean and cheese, and potato and veg-
gie, which are enjoyable alternatives to the 
usual Mexican meal. Their menu also 
includes a little twist: hamburgers and fries. 
"Why hamburgers? Because we can!" is their 
motto. 

The shop's specialty is tamales, which are 
made daily and feature unique ingredients. 
For Thanksgiving, they prepared a cranber-
ry and turkey filled tamale. Others include 
three-bean, pineapple and mushroom-tofu. 
They make about 3,000 tamales a month and 
more than quadruple that during the holi-
~ys for catered events. 

This restaurant has simple, Mexican 
decor and is well-loved by its regular cus-
tomers. Sit outside on the brightly lit patio 
or in the yellow booths indoors. There is 
always great service and the atmosphere is 
extremely welcoming. On Friday and 
Saturday nights, they deliver only to stu-
dents. Most everything is under five dollars, 

.. malcing it very affordable for the college stu-
dent. 

HARRY'S COFFEE SHOP 
7545 Girard Ave., La JoOa 

This friendly, old-style coffee shop, com-
plete with large, comfy brown booths, is the 
perfect setting for a cozy breakfast. Open 
daily from 6 a.m. to 3 p.m., their home-style 
breakfasts are served all day. Their variety of 
"ummJettes" as well as specialties like huevos 
rancheros and eggs benedict are beyond par. 
Their extensive menu includes an entire 
page devoted to pancakes. Among those 

served are banana pancakes, blueberry, 
wheat and dollar-style. Bring a little bit of 

Harry~ breakfast magic home with their 
homemade cinnamon apple syrup and oat-
meal pancake mix. 

For the post-breakfast crowd, Harry's 
serves great sandwiches, burgers and milk-
shakes. They even offer a liver and onion 
platter. The tuna fish sandwich is also a local 
favorite, as well as the delicious and buttery 
Rueben. 

EUROPFAN AND RUSSIAN DEll 
4150 Regents Park Road, Ste. 11 0 , La 
Jolla 

In a little cove off Regents Road, this 
small but inviting family-owned Russian, 
Polish and Jewish Deli serves up an assort-
ment of European fare. Their simple menu 
includes sandwiches, salads, soups and 
desserts, all of which are sensibly priced. For 
strictly Russian cuisine, try the chicken Kiev, 
cheese-and-chicken stuffed mushrooms and 
the peroshkis. Their hefty portions satisfy 
the biggest of appetites and everything is 
made fresh to order with quality ingredients. 
In addition to menu items, the deli case 
includes pre-made meals like cooked sausage 
with Russian salad and seasoned rice with 
chicken. 

Russian magazines. boxes of crackers, 
sliced 'bread, candies and other provisions 
adorn the walls and along the window sills 
are dozens of tiny babushka dolls. Most of 
the clientele are friends of the family and can 
be heard chatting in Russian throughout the 
day. This makes the outsider's experience 
that much more authentic. 

MANANA'S 
3030 Kurtz St., San Diego 

Offering authentic Mexican dishes like 
rolled tacos, chile rellenos and burritos, the 
Mexican fare at Mananas is muy bueno. Like 
most Mexican restaurants, a majority of their 
meals include rice, beans and a drink. Be sure 
to try their homemade horchata. Almost 
everything served is under three dollars. 

The atmosphere of this quaint restaurant 
is laid-back and easy-going. Two men, at 
most, work diligently in the kitchen where 
they serve their customers. The service is 
quick. friendly and efficient and the drive-
thru makes it effortless to enjoy a hot 
Mexican meal. For walk-up customers, the 
sea tin g is outdoors onl y.

do. So occasionally an inappropri-
ate feeling of familiarity accompa-
nies a situation in the absence of a 
memory. Deja vu is nothing more 
than an imprecision in memory, 
like a mental hiccup." 

Those who experience deja vu, 
however, like to think that their 
feelings of familiarity come from 
real memories, not just mental 
imprecision. But these memories 
have to come from somewhere 
besides personal imagination. 

Some suggest that these distant 
memories come from past dreams. 
According to this theory, deja vu 
occurs when the subconscious rec-
ognizes a real event [Q be similar 
to an event in a past dream. After 
sleep, the conscious mind usually 
forgets the events that take place 
during a dream. But perhaps the 
memory of dreams is stored some-
where deep within the subcon-
scious mind, and during deja vu, 
the memories resurface. 

Another theory, formulated by 
the father of psychology, Sigmund 
Freud, suggests that a guilty sub-
conscious can sometimes force the 
memory to forget certain events 

" Deja vu is nothing more 
than an imprecision in 
memory, like a mental 

hiccup." 
- PaIrida S. C1uchIancI, chair, 

phlosophy department 

from the past, or [Q "remember" 
events that never happened at all. 
According to Freud, deja vu occurs 
either because a person wants to 
remember something that never 
happened, or because a person 
wants to suppress a memory of an 
unfavorable event. 

Clairvoyance, the ability to see 
into the future, and precognition, 
the cognizant knowledge of an 
event before it actually occurs, 
have also been cited by psycholo-
gists as being responsible for the 
deja vu phenomenon. The psy-
chologists who support this theory 
have very little evidence to main-
tain their argument. They draw 
from highly anecdotal sources 
claiming that deja vu must only be 
part of the cognitive process 
because it is linked exclusively to 
vision and not any other sense . 
And vision is connected directly to 
the cognitive areas of the brain, 
unlike the sense of smell which is 
linked directly to memory. 

Unfortunately, because of the 
complexity of the human brain, it 
is impossible to prove or disprove 
any theory about deja vu. Perhaps 
different people experience deja vu 
for different reasons, since indi-
viduals can make up their own 
minds. What lies beneath this 
mysterious phenomenon may then 
be more a matter of penonality 
than neurology.

the skills to play in the NBA, or 
at least fool an NBA team into

In 2000, the Tritons outgrew 
their Division m roots and graduat-
ed into Division II and the CCAA, 
one of the toughest conferences in 
all of Division II. In its first season 
in the CCAA, UCSD took the 
South Division tide with an t 1-5-2 
overall record and a 9-3-2 confer-
ence record. The Tritons repeated 
their relative success with winning 
seasons in the CCAA every year 
except for 2001, when injuries put 
the team at a distinct disadvantage. 

McManus: Alums praise their former head coach for versatility 

Such competitiveness led 
Armstrong to record his 300th 
career win this season, a milestone 
that means little to him right now. 

"I'm not thinking that way," he 
said. "I'm thinking about what went 
wrong this season." 

Although Armstrong downplays 
the importance of the record, it will 
always remain in the history books 
at UCSD. Earlier this season, 
UCSD women's soccer coach Brian 
McManus recorded his 300th win 
as well. McManus and Armstrong 
are the only two active coaches in 
NCAA soccer history each with 
300 wins at the same school. 

From his 2J-year tenure at 
UCSD, Armstrong has many mem-
ories and reasons to be proud, but 
all he'll talk about is next year. 

"I'll look back when I retire," 
he said. 

continwd from page ,6 
team can acquire the team chem-
istry essential to success. 
McManus possesses an uncanny 
ability to mold different players 
into a winning combination. 

"He was an incredible, incred-
ible coach," former Triton player 
Kara Morris said. "He can take 
any team, any player and make it 
into a winner." 

Morris and All-American julia 
Cuder graduated from UCSD in 
2002 and were part of the 1999, 
2000 and 2001 championship 
teams. Both were on hand Oct. 
17 for the ceremony celebrating 
McManus' 300th victory. 
. "[McManus) is definitely the 
best coach I've every played for," 
Cuder said. "He knows the game 
so well, and he knows how to 
work with aU these individuals. 
And he brings out all their 
strengths and combines them 
.together for a kick-ass team, 
every year." 

And as for his unconventional 
barefoot coaching, McManus 
chalks it up to tradition.

"I never liked shoes; even when I 
was living in Scotland, I hated 
shoes and socks. It's just part of it, 
just the things over the year, just 
the things we do." 

Such idiosyncrasies make it 
easy to comprehend why so 
many, especially his players, love 
him. He is affable, with a disarm-
ing personality. He emphasizes 
having fun and simply playing the 
game, borrowing these principles 
from his native land. 

"I love my players to play free, 
and I was like that," he said. "I 
like to just go and play. In 
Scotland in the 1960s and '70s, 
that's how they played. They love 
people enjoying themselves, and 
they're not so strategic." 

McManus imparts his philoso-
phy to his players and also fosters 
an environment of friendship and 
camaraderie within the team. 

"You make your best friends 
while you're out here," Morris 
said. "He makes it so much fun 
on the field, and ir becomes a part 
of your life off the field, too." 

Sophomore mid fielder Megan 
Dickey, who scored the game-

.I 

winning goal against San 
Francisco State on Oct. 3 to 
clinch McManus' 300th win, also 
has nothing but praise for her 
coach. 

"Hes amazing, and I tell every-
one that I would never trade this 
experience for anything," Dickey 
said on Oct. 3. "He's awesome." 

Before UCSD, McManus 
played professional soccer for the 
Raith Rovers and Aberdeen in 
Scotland for a few years, but later 
moved to England to play semi-
professional soccer. 

"I played pro in Scotland," he 
said. "It was a grind. And when 1 
went to England, I started play-
ing semipro, and it was great .... I 
had fun and I ended up a play-
er/coach. That's what we do over 
here, we try to have fun with it." 

While in England, he met 
Armstrong, whom he played for 
and who later recruited McManus 
to become his assistant coach for 
the UCSD men's team. 

"I played for Derek in 
England back in 1970 and he's 
been a big influence," he said. 
"Everything I've learned through 

coaching has been through him." 
Armstrong also reached 300 

wins thi.s season, making UCSD 
the first school in history to have 
two active coaches with 300 
career victories. 

Looking back, McManus was 
happy to reach his 300rh win, bur 
not necessarily for himself. 

"I was more nervous for the 
kids because ifthey weren't going 
to get it today the pressure would 
have been getting a lot, and 
nobody would just forget abollt 
it," he said on Oct. 3. 

The indelible mark McManus 
has left on UCSD women's soccer 
and his players will not soon be 
forgotten. In fact, the coach still 
has players from as far back as the 
1980s who return to visit. His 
players, past and presel1t, are what 
drive his desire to coach. 

"I can say that [my 300th win] 
is not JUSt about the players today, 
it's about the players who have 
played the last 18 years," he said. 
"There was a lot of alumni today; 
there was one today from 1989-90. 
It's things like that that make it 
worthwhile."

Career landmark won't 
slow down Annstrong 

Men's soccer head coach doesn't 
dwell on past, anticipates 2005 

By RAEL ENTEEN 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD men's soccer team 
went 9-4-3, placed third in the 
South Division of the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
and played in the semifinal game 
of the CCAA playoffs, yet accord-
ing to,. head coach Derek 
Armstrong, who reached his 
mile tone career 300th win with 
the Tritons during 2004, the sea-
son wa still a little disappointing. 

Armstrong is not crazy - he 
ju t holds his team to very high 
expectations. This year's squad 
had a tough act to follow after the 
2003 team made it to the CAA 
champion hip game and the 

'CAA Division II playoffs with 
an t \ -7 -1 record. The CAA 
playoff appearance was the 
Triton ' first since they moved up 
from Division m. UCSD almo t 
made it two years in a row, but 
were not selected for Regionals 
this year. 

De pite being di appointed 
that his team did not go all the

way, Armstrong has a characteris-
tically optimistic outlook on next 
year. 

"I think we're going to be the 
dangerous team in the league," he 
said. "I think we're going for a 
National Championship." 

A National Championship 
would be a first for the Tritons, 
but Annstrong is confident that 
the team next year will be that 
good. Junior mid fielder Matt 
Davey, the Tritons' point leader 
this year, an All-CCAA First 
Team member and an AlI-
American, will return next year to 
try to lead the team to 2 South 
Division title and hopefully more. 

The division will be chock full 
of competition with Cal State 
Dominguez Hills, undefeated 
during the regular season in the 
CCAA this year, and Cal State 
Bakersfield, the reigning CCAA 
champion. 

"CSDH and Bakersfield are 
going to be strong next yea r," 
Armstrong said. "It's going to be a 
heck of a con ference." 

To compete in a tough confer-
ence such as the CCAA, the 
Tritons need to maintain the 
dominant defense that kept them 
in many games this year. Both 
goalkeepers, Edward Ruhland 
and Scott Mazurier, are seniors 
and cannot contribute next year. 
Many other defensemen are also 
graduating this year, but 
Armstrong's confidence does not 
waver one bit. 

"We're pretty well covered," 
he said. "We're not going to miss 
a beat. We'll be fine." 

Armstrong has proven himself 
year after year as the head coach 
of the Tritons. He has coached at 
UCSD for 23 years and has a 
303-114-40 record. Many of 
those wins came in Division ill, 
where Armstrong won three 
national titles in 1988, when the 
Tritons went undefeated with a

Success story continues 
for McManus, UCSD 

By CYNTHIA BLADE CHAVEZ 
Associate Sports Editor 

It's a curious thing when one 
watches a UCSD women's soccer 
match. Look over at the Triton 
bench and there's head coach 
Brian McManus sitting barefoot, 
balancing a baH under each foot, 
yelling out instructions at his 
players. 

For the Scottish-born 
McManus, coaching has always 
been about his players. He credits 
them for the success of UCSD 
women's soccer and it's only fit-
ting that they played a role in 
jurnpstarting his career. 

In 1987, then-UCSD Athletic 
Director Judy Sweet faced a 
dilemma. Women's soccer head 
coach, John Leaney had left to 
coach at Macalester CoHege in 
Minnesota, and at the time 
McManus was an assistant coach 
for UCSD men's soccer under 
Derek Armstrong. Sweet was in a 
bind, but some of the players on 
the women's team, having previ-
ously worked out with McManus, 
had an idea for a replacement. 
T hey approached Sweet about 
McManus taking over Leaney's 
position, but the future head 
coach himself initially refused the 
offer. 

"I said 'no' at first, McManus 
said. "I'd never seen women play 
until I came down here." 

But a determined Sweet 
pressed on, pleading him to at 
least take over for a few months 
while she searched for a head 
coach, and McManus obliged. 

"And 18 years later, I'm still 
here and I'm glad," he said. "I've 
enjoyed every minute of it here. I 
love it; it's great. I never ever 
thought in my Ijfe that I would do 
it. " 

In his 18 years, he has had the 
success most coaches only dream 
of: seven NCAA national titles 
(two in Division n, three in 
Division III), 13 total coaching 
awards (includjng four NCAA 
National Coach of the Year hon-
ors), 12 regional titles, five 
straight California CoUegiate

Athletic Association South 
Division titles, four CCAA 
Championships and 17 NCAA 
playoff appearances. 

After winning his seventh 
national title in Division III in 
1999 against Macalester (1-0), 
McManus and the Tritons 
entered Division IT and achieved 
an otherwise impossible task -
they stonned in and won two 
consecutive national titles in 2001 
and 2002. Despite the fact that 
UCSD is the only Division IT 
school that does not award athlet-
ic scholarships, it continues to be 
a perennial powerhouse in 
women's soccer, reaching the 
semifinals last season and winning 
its fifth-straight CCAA South 
Division title this season. 

McManus' notable career 
record of 305-39-21 gives him a 
winning percentage of .864, rank-
ing him founh highest in NCAA 
history among coaches at any 
level. Anson Dorrance (.946) of 
Division I Nonh Carolina holds 
the top spot.

Legendary sports announcer to visit UCSD 
Enberg reflects on three decades of life in and out of the broadcast booth 

By MAnttEW GRANT 
Sports Editor 

Veteran CBS and NBC sports 
broadcaster Dick Enberg's new 
book was set for publication under 
the title, "Oh My! Fifty Years of 
Rubbing Shoulders with 
Greatness," before a last-minute 
change reduced it to simply, "Dick 
Enberg: Oh My!" After a glance at 
his accomplishments, one might 
ask why. 

"The [broadcastl booth isn 't a 
very big place," Enberg said. "So 
I am actually rubbing shoulders 
with whoever is in there with 
me." 

And greatness is no under-
statement. After having broadcast 
21 Wimbledons, 18 French 
Opens, nine Super Bowls, nine 
Rose Bowls, four Olympic Games, 
the World Series and three 
National League Playoffs, three 
Heavyweight Boxing 
Championships, the NBA 
Playoffs and All-Star Game, the 
NCAA men's basketball Final 
F our and a plethora of other 
events from more sports than 

most people can name, Enberg is 
one of the most consummate pro-
fessional athletics announcers in 
the business. 

He has had the privilege of 
working alongside Hall of Fame 
pitchers Don Drysdale and Tom 
Seaver, NBA great Bill Walton, 
Phil Simms, John Wooden, Chris 
Evert and the author of the fore-
word to Enberg's newest book, 
John McEnroe. 

Enberg began his career in 
sports journalism in 1965 as the 
radio and television voice of the 
California Angels, UCLA basket-
baH and the Los Angeles Rams on 
his way to earning four California 
Sportscaster of the Year awards. 

In 1973, on assignment and 
following the U.S. National 
Basketball team, Enberg became 
the first American sports broad-
caster to call a game within the 
People's Republic of China. 

But 13 Emmy Awards, 13 
Sportscaster of the Year Awards 
and a National Emmy for 
Lifetime Achievement aside, 
Enberg's roots are in education. 

"I used to teach and I was the 

assistant baseball coach at Cal 
State Northridge," he said. "That 
was from 1961 to 1965, but it was 
my first love and someday that's 
where I'll return." 

For the time being, Enberg 
has another three years left on his 
current contract with CBS; how-
ever, he hopes that whatever fol-
lows will have to do with educa-
tion. 

"My field was in health educa-
tion, but it's been so long since 
then that I'd have to go back to 
school for another four years to 
learn about that stuff again, but I 
feel like I have a lot of knowledge 
and experience to give," Enberg 
said. 

Included in that experience is a 
keen public speaking talent. 

"I speak on coHege campuses 
from time to time," he said. "It's 
always interesting to hear what 
young people are interested in. 
Students excite me by their ener-
gy." 

Enberg will visit UCSD on 
Dec. 1, promoting his new book 
at the Price Center Theater 
between noon and 1 p.m. 

"I encourage people to come 
by with any questions and I'H try 
to field them all," Enberg said. 
"But [the book] is not just about 
sports - it's somewhat about my 
life and life lessons even for people 
who aren't big sports fans."

T here is a fundamental right in American society to be able to make money for one-
self and one's family. This goes 
hand in hand with the fundamental 
hope to be successful, with the 
measure of success oftentimes 
being the size of one's bank 
account. It is with that in mind that 
we witness more and more prep 
school basketball prodigies making 
the transition from high school to 
the promise of the high life in the 
NBA. 

Few would argue that prep 
uperstars turned pro like Cavaliers 

forward and 2003-04 Rookie of the 
Year LeBron James or Suns for-
ward and 2002-03 Rookie of the 
Year Amare Stoudamire were not 
ready for the ranks of the NBA, as 
both proved capable of making 
themselves cornerstones of their 
respective franchises. However, 
should we blame a player out of 
high school who never developed, 
like recently relea ed Supersonics 
forward Leon Smith, or a player 
who so far has shown no inclina-
tion of being able to live up to the 
hype, such as Wizards forward 
Kwame Brow, for entering the 
NBA draft? Why would a high 
school player projected as a lottery 
pick pass up NBA money to play 
NCAA basketball? 

NCAA bask.etbaH is a profitable 
industry that affords expensive 
salaries for its franchises without 
paying its players a dime. If athletes 
happen to become injured during 
the course of their coUege career, 
there is no monetary compensa-
tion. Former Western KentucJc.y 7 
foot, 1 inch center Chris Marcus 
averaged 12 points and 12 
rebounds per game as a sophomore 
during the 1999-00 season and 
seemed a certain top-10 NBA draft 
prospect. He chose to stay and play 
for his college team for the 2000-
01 season before developing a foot 
injury that limited him to 15 games 
for the 2001-02 season. Marcus was 
not drafted when he gradua~d. 
There's no guarantee Marcus 
would have become a superstar or 
avoided the foot injury had he 
entered the NBA draft after his 
sophomore season, but the guaran-
teed money would have eased some 
of the pain. 

There is also no guarantee that 
a polished college player will trans-
late into an NBA All-Sw. One of 
the greatest players in collegiate 
bask:etball history, Duke alum and 
Heat center Christian Laettner, 
developed into nothing more than 
a borderline staner playing for one 
of the weakest NBA teams. The 
NBA draft, like that of the NFL, 
MLB or any professional spon, 
really is nothing more than a crap 
shoot. There is no assurance that 
one player will be better than a 
player he is drafted ahead of. If 
careers were accurately projected 
pre-draft, 1984 second-overall 
NBA draft pick. and former 
Trailblazers center Sam Bowie 
wouldn't have been taken before 
the le~=ary Michael Jordan, 
Bucks rd Joe Smith wouldn't 
have been the first overall pick in
