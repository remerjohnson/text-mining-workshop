Troupe resigns from UCSD 
Literature prof. to leave at end of 02 ... 03 year 

By DANIEL WArn 
Senior Staff Writer 

Former California poet laureate 
Quincy Troupe announced on Dec. 
3 his intent to resign from his posi-
tion as a UCSD literature profes-
sor. His resignation will take effect 
at the end of the 2002-03 academic 
year in June. He will continue 
teaching at UCSD until then. 

"I very much regret my lapse in 
judgment and the problems it has 
created for my department and the 
broader UCSD community," 
Troupe said in his resignation letter. 

He held a news conference at 
UCSD on Dec. 3, accompanied by 
his wife and a few colleagues, dur-
ing which he answered questions 
regarding his resignation. 

"I'm the kind of person who 
faces up to my mistakes," Troupe 
said. 

Troupe had not been asked to 
resign by the university, and he 
could have remained on the faculty, 
according to Richard Attiyeh, vice 
chancellor for research and dean of 
graduate studies. Attiyeh said he 
was "extremely impressed by the 
dignity with which [Troupe) has 

Shelton to 
be 2003 
elections 
manager 

By THOMAS NEELEY 
Associate News Editor 

A.S. Commissioner of Athletics 
Robin Shelton is expected to be 
voted the A.S. elections manager to 
oversee the 2003 A.S. Council elec-
tions in April, pending a confirma-
tion vote by the A.S. Council. 

The elections manager chairs 
the elections committee, which will 
oversee the A.S. Council elections 
in April 2003 and settles disputes 
between candidates. The commit-
tee is made up of a representative 
from each of the six colleges and 
one from the A.S. Council. 

The vote, which was supposed to 
have occurred at the Dec. 4 A.S. 
Council meeting, was postponed at 
Shelton's request. 

Shelton, who ran unopposed as 
an independent candidate last year, 
said he asked to have the vote 
deferred until the beginning of win-
ter quarter so that he will be free of 
any potential conIDets of interest 
that he might have. Specifically, he 
cited his intentions to give slates 
and individuals "what they need to 

handled himself." 
Troupe explained at the news 

conference that he resigned both 
because of the distress the situation 
was causing his family and col-
leagues, and because of the "over-
whelming" pity being directed at 
him. 

"I've never been looked at by 
anyone with a look of pity," Troupe 
said . "But I 
would see that 
in some people. 
I didn't want 
that." 

His resigna-
tion comes 
almost two 
months afrer he 
resigned as the 
nominee for 
Cali fornia 's 
first poet laure-

Quincy Troupe 
UCSD professor of 

literature 

ate. He had admitted to falsifying 
information on his resume, a dis-
crepancy that was discovered dur-
ing a routine background check 
while his nomination was awaiting 
confirmation by the state senate. 

The falsified degree also 
appeared on Troupe's resume for 
his UCSD faculty position. After 

the initial revelation, the university 
began an investigation that could 
have had several different conclu-
sions. 

"There are options open to the 
university ... [ranging) from repri-
mand, censure ... [to) some finan-
cial penalty, and it could include 
dismissal," said Vice Chancellor of 
External Relations James Langley 
in October. Troupe's resignation 
effectively brings the investigation 
to a close. 

Troupe, 63, claimed on his 
resume to have graduated with a 
bachelor's degree from 
Grambling State University in 
Louisiana. The background check 
revealed that this was false; he had 
not attained a degree. According 
to the San Ditgo Union-Tribune, 
Troupe later said that although he 
had no degree, he studied political 
science at Grambling from 1957 
to 1958. 

The San Diego academic com-
munity was divided in their reac-
tions to Troupe's resignation.

awe and completely saddened and

Supreme Court to hear 
affirmative action case 
Decision to affect university 

admissions policies nationwide 
By MAn SCHRADER 

Senior Staff Writer 

The U .S. Supreme Court 
announced on Dec. 2 that it will 
hear the University of Michigan 
reverse discrimination case, 
which could potentially end affir-
mative action in aU public univer-
sities by June 2003. 

"This is a momem of great 
significance in our nation's histo-
ry," said University of Michigan 
President Mary Sue Coleman . 

"We stand at the threshold of a 
decision that will have a profound 
impact on our nation's higher 
education system and on our race 
relations broadly." 

The court hopes that its ruling 
would potentially end the ambi-
guity over the 1978 Bakke v. 
University of California ruling, in 
which the Supreme Court 
allowed for race to be a factor in 
university admissions but out-

Students give back 
during tiolidays 

Campus groups donate toys, 
food, clothing to community 

By GAELLE FAURE 
Associate News Editor 

To get into the giving spirit of 
the holiday season, the UCSD 
community is participating in 
food drives, toy drives, Adopt-A-
Fanuly programs, and a winter 
wear donation drive to provide 
warmth to immigrants crossing 
the San Diego desert. 

The Toy and Food Drive, 
sponsored by A.S. Volunteer 
Connection and the UCSD Staff 
Association, is collecting food for 
the San Diego Food Bank. and 
toys for children hospitalized at 
the UCSD Burn Unit, the Keiser 
Pediatric Ward and the Children 
& Adult Psychiatric Services. 

"This campus-wide tradition 
is getting bigger and bigger every 
year," said Executive Director of 
Volunteer Connection Rosalynn 
Taing. "Last year, it was so suc-
cessful the whole Price Center 
Ballroom was filled with toys." 

The toy collection effon cul-

minates on Dec. 12 at the annual 
Holiday Pancake Breakfast, a 
popular annual event sponsored 
by the UCSD Staff Association, 
where the piles of gifts will be on 
display. After the breakfast, the 
toys will be taken over to the 
children by Santa Claus, who 
spends time in each child's room 
while distributing their presents. 
He also traditionally visits babies 
in the preemie ward to give them 
stuffed toys. 

"Last year, we collected close 
to 700 toys donated by the whole 
gamut of donors of the UCSD 
community, staff and students 
alike," said Chair of the Toy and 
Food Drive Deborah McManus. 

Suggestions for toys range 
from infants to teenagers, pro-
vided that they are new and 
unwrapped or in new condition. 
Collection bins for both toys and 
food have been put up at loca-
tions allover campus, including

World AIDS Day event promotes 
awareness and remembrance 

By MARNmE FEDERIS 
Staff Writer 

Student Health Advocates led 
the UCSD community'S recogni-
tion of World AIDS Day, officially 
marked on Dec. 1, by providing an 
in formational booth on Library 
Walk and speakers on Nov. 26. 
Similar events around the local 
community have also been held to 
acknowledge this event, which 
kicks off a month of awareness and 
remembrance of those who have 
suffered because of AIDS. 

"Some people think that AIDS 
doesn't affect them," said Revelle 
College senior Lisa Lopez. "This 
event shows that stuff like IAIDSl 
does exist." 

SHA handed out red ribbons, 
buttons, pamphlets about the dis-
ease and free condoms. Students 
could pass by and grab the free 
items or ask booth workers any 
questions that they might have. 

"HIV/AIDS is a pertinent issue 
with students," said Deborah Pi no-
Saballett, outreach coordinator and 
health educator at Student Health 
Services. "This event is just a way 
of reminding people of prevention 
and to support those Jiving with the 
disease." 

Information was also provided 
to those seeking volunteer oppor-
tunities in organizations around the 
local community. In addition, a 
prevention quilt made up of cloth 
panels from the six UCSD colleges 
was set up for students to look at. 
The quilt included statistics and 
personal messages to those who 
suffer and have died from AIDS. At 
noon, Geisel Library played a bell 
tribute in honor of the event. 

"There's a lot of information 
about the disease," said Katie 

Martin, co-president for SHA. 
"This event is a great opportunity 
to learn from people who are living 
with HTV and see that AIDS is out 
there." 

Students were also encouraged 
to attend a lecture and listen to 
speakers who are living with HIY. 
The speakers talked about their 
experiences and discussed the 
importance of prevention and tak-
ing care of oneself. A video docu-
mentary was also played, which 
depicted teenagers who are JllV-
positive talking about their hard-
ships and goals. In the end, stu-
dents were able to ask questions 
and interact with the speakers. 

"Listening to an actual person 
makes the disease more real," said 
Revelle College senior Eva Barker. 
"It 's been very informative hearing 
about people who are HIV-positive 
leading normal lives and going on 
with day-to-day activities." 

According to the Center for 
Disease and Control Web site, there 
are 40 million people living with 
AIDS, and 95 percent of people with 
the disease are living in undeveloped 
and developing countries. California 
reported the second-highest number 
of residents who are HIV-positive in 
the entire nation. 

Some students commented on 
the seriousness of the issue and its 
importance to young adults today, 
since we are a generation that grew 
up amidst the rise ofHIV/AIDS. 

"Everyone's getting it these 
days," said John Muir College 
senior Eric Lam. "You never know 
when it'll hit closer to home." 

On the evening of Dec. I , a tree-
lighting ceremony to commemorate 
those who have died of AIDS was 
also held at the Village Hillcrest 
Retail Center in San Diego. This 

Rachel A. Garcia/Guardian 
AIDS Dily: A qui~ made of panels by 
the six colleges was on display Nov. 26. 
II -year tradition was sponsored by 
Mama's Kitchen, an organization 
that brings food to men, women and 
children affected by AIDS around 
San Diego County. Ornaments that 
can be personalized for a loved one 
are available for purchasing at par-
ticipating Hillcrest stores through-
out the month of December, with 
proceeds from these sales going to 
Mama's Kitchen. T he Lesbian Gay 
Bisexual Transgender Resource 
Office is one campus orgomization 
that supported the event. 

"It is important that we recog-
nize the devastation that AIDS has 
had on our world ," said LGTBRO 
Director Shaun Travers. "The tree-
lighting ceremony, along with 
other incredible events, raises 
awareness, honors those who have 
passed and energizes people to find 
solutions to addressing the effects 
and causes of the disease."

Iraq conflict protested 
Bands, speakers rally at UCSD 

By CARLAN WENDLER 
Senior Staff Writer 

Local performers The 
Nectarines and Able-Minded 
Poets joined the recent anti -war 
protest effort by members of the 
campus commullity when they 
held a concert in Price Center 
Plaza on Dec. 4 at noon. The 
event was followed by a number 
of UCSD students and faculty 
who led discussion on the United 
States' recent conflict with Iraq. 

The concert and lecture mark 
the largest of the recent anti-war 
events held at UCSD in the past 
quarter. 

Marla Fuentes, one of the 
event coordinators and member 
of the Campus Peace Coali tion, 
noted a trend toward increased 
student participation, citing a sig-
nificant rise in the number of stu-
dents requesting materials from 
information tables and signing up 
to receive regular e-mail updates. 

"This is one of the bigger 
events in terms of students and 
the number of organizations 
sponsoring [itl ," said Rebecca 
Anshell, a Thurgood Marshall 
College junior. 

With greater organizational 
participation in support of the con-
cert and rally comes more pro-
found divergence among ideolo-
gies. The medJey of groups spon-
soring these events - CPC, 
International Socil lists 
Organization, the Green Party at 
UCSD and La Voz Frontierzo - all 
have different perspectives on what 
action the United States should 
take toward Iraq. However, event 
coordinators did emphasize "three 
points of unity" - namely: ending 
economic sanctions, avoiding war 

on lraq and protecting dome tic 
civi l liberties. 

Ethnic studies professor 
George Lipsitz addresred the 
noontime crowd on JUS t these 
issues , using impassioned 
rhetoric to decry the adoption of 
war "as a casual instrument of 
foreign policy" rather than a last 
resort. 

After the concert and speech-
es, a dozen individuals and group 
representatives met for a discus-
sion session to promote a unified 
front in resisting a possible war 
on Iraq. This meeting, the first of 
its kind at UCSD, represents the 
initial efforts of the CPC to coor-
dinate anti-war sentiment on 3 
community-wide basis. 

The performances by far 
received the most positive stu-
dent reaction. First, the pseudo-
hippy funk jazz/rock vocals of 
The Nectarines got the attention 
of Price Center patrons. After a 
few brief interludes, including 
speeches from members of each 
constituent organization and 
Lipsitz's address, a spoken word 
group known as Able-Minded 
Poets launched salvoes of criti -
cism against the U.S. govern -
ment and challenged the audi -
ence with rhythmic ca ll s to 
action. 

As for the future of the antiwar 
movement at UCSD and San 
Diego, students project that the 
momentum will continue to build 
as protesters nationally and abroad 
continue to organize action. 

"There's been a growing rad-
icalization around the war," 
Anshell said. "People are realiz-
ing what problems arise when we 
attack a country devastated by 
sanctions. "

SIO losses less 
damaging than 

other budget cuts 
Fac1l1g a budget crisis, the Ca li fornia 

state legislature has cut research funding 
for the Scripps In ti tu tion of Oceanog:raphy 
by 10 percent, or 1.26 million. 'NhIle It is 
true that the UCSD Call1pUS would not exist 
were It not for the intluential oceanograph-
ic establishment and that the university 
owes much of its prestige to the accom-
plishments of Scripps, given California's 
current budget situatIOn, this is money that 
is ultimately better spent on crucial social 
programs throughout the state; Scripps 
should not be a funding priority. 

At stake in the cuts are the jobs of 20 staff 
members, Scripps' newest and fanciest 
research vessel, extensive collections of 
marine and oceanic samples, and long-term 
research programs. If it is a decision between 
preserving these things or maintaining or 
stabilizing funding for K-12 education, 
Medi-Caland transportation throughoutthe 
state of California, the choice is clear. 

Looking at the big picture, 20 jobs is not 
a huge cut; the institution will still have 
three other research vessels and the collec-
tions will be maintained by somebody, just 
not us. Yes, it is important to do oceano-
graphic research because the oceans give us 
vital clues about global warming. However, 
the budget criSIS will not last forever: 
Things like healthcare and basic education 
are immediately more important and essen-
tial for the quality of life of Californians. 

Unlike these other programs that are at 
risk, Scripps has the option of seeking alter-
native funding. With SIO Director Charles 
Kennel and UCSD Chancellor Robert C. 
Dynes both pledging their support to the 
quest for funding, it is likely that Scripps 
will find a way to get by. In the long run, 
this mone}, can come from private aona-
tions and federal agencies, and for short-
term relief, it can come from within the UC 
system from UCSD and the office of the 
president. 

Even the director of Scrip~s admitted 
that the cuts are an "inevitable ' result of a 
decade-long reduction in research spend-
ing. However, gjven the circumstances, the 
biggest blow WIll be ultimately 'psychologi-
cal, with the cuts coinciding WIth the cen-
tennial of the institution's founding.

Tri~ky Iraq situation calls for consideration 
Bush must react calmly, thoughtfully to avoid a mess 

By EVELYN HSIEH 
Staff Writer 

As many American citizens pre-
pare to grab the best deals at depart-
ment stores and dig out Christmas 
decorations from the garage, the 
nation readies itself for what may be 
an inevitable conflict with Iraq. After 
months filled with rhetoric from 
Washington, wavering suppOrt from 
the United Nations, and unsteady 
opinion at home and abroad, the time 
is fast approaching when a decisive 
event can and perhaps will occur. 
The course of events took a reason-
able hlfl1 and elicited a collective sigh 
of relief when Saddam Hussein 
allowed U .N. inspectors to enter his 
country. 

Now, in the midst of the inspec-
tions, we ask ourselves, what do we do 
next? Hopefully, we will consider it 
carefu lly before jumping into a cer-
tainly perilous conflict. 

U.N. Resolution 1441 , which 
paved the way for an inspections-or-
else scenario, was a much needed step 
to both breathe down the neck of 
Hussein and provide a temporary 
block to George W . Bush 's raging war 
train. However, as the Sunday dead -
line approaches for Hussein and the 
Iraqi government to list all weapon 
build-ups, or lack thereof, the course 
of action is becoming both increasing-
ly narrow and complicated. President 
Bush should consider his options even 
more carefully in this incredibly criti-
cal time. 

President Bush has already mired 
the nation in a do-or-die si tuation. At 
this point, the question "Is going into 
Iraq a good idea or not?" is irrelevant; 
what matters is a careful but firm con-
sideration of and decision about what 
is to be done next. What the president 
does from the end of this year to the 
dawn of the next will very likely deter-
mine a sizeable part of his political 
legacy and will push him from - or 
toward - the fate of his father in 
1992.

" 'W'hat the president does from 
the end of this year to the 
dawn of the next will v~ 
likely determine a sizeable 

part of his political1egacy and 
will push him fran} - ar 
toward - the fate of his 

f~in 1992." 
Even more important than that, 

the far-from-solid support of other 
world powers and wavering opinion at 
home has signaled a need to tread ca u-
tiously. Then again, this runs contrary 
to Bush's zero-tolerance, now·or-
never, aggressive stance. His current 
position was clearly delineated when 
his administration considered a pre-
emptive strike and strongly clung to 
its notion that Hussein is still stockpi l. 
ing weapons of mass destruction. 
However, a unilateral decision to plow 
into Iraq, especially after the compro-
mise of the United Nations, is now, 

more than ever, a controversial option. 
Inspections have just commenced, 

and so far, chief U.N. inspector Hans 
Blix and his crew have been treated 
with adequate compliance, if not hos-
pitality. While Blix is a far cry from 
the hard·line war hawks in 
Washington, he is sti ll there to 
painstakingly look for any signs of 
biological, chemical or nuclear arse-
nals. 

The deal is, if the Iraqi government 
decides to stall or block the inspec-
tions, then they have grounds for a 
possible military action and opening of 
more options - most of which are in 
favor of what U.S. hard-liners are 
looking for. That direction is relatively 
clear-cut in comparison to what hap-
pens if Hussein does allow the U.N . 
inspectors to make a broad yet in-
depth search of his country's suspect 
hot spots. 

It may be absurd to ask that ques-
tion, since it seems as if Bush and those 
who support him are going to find a 
way to attempt to topple Hussein's 
regime and rid the United States of 
any Iraq-related bothers. However, the 
fact that Hussein gave way and allowed 
the U.N. inspectors in what may have 
hardly been a conciliatory gesture 
should be taken at face value, nonethe-
less. This means that the Bush admin-
istration, with this concession by 
Hussein, needs to think twice before 
initiating and committing to whit will 
liuly be a costly and complicated con-
flict. . 

In an already troubled economic 
aonosphere, Iraq has continually 
shown that it will not be unequivoca l if 
it bites at all. Even if the United States 
and its limited number of all ies succeed 
in ending Hussein's reign, they face a 
disorganized Iraq that will require 
Western aid and occupation, which 
will amount to a lot of time and 
money. 

What thi s ultimately amounts to i 
a need for Bush to take stock of the

Miranda rights may fall prey 
to U.S. War on Terrorism 

speak up, 
speak out 

Parisa Baharian 

T he War on Terrorism has found a new target - the American public's Fifth Amendment right against self-
incrimination, aka the Miranda warning. 

Forty-six years ago in Miranda v. Ariwna, 
the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that all sus-
pects must be read their rights to remain silent 
as a check against police abuse and infringe-
ment on constirutional rights. 

Once again, the battle over the Fifth 
Amendment is taking place in the Supreme 
Court, but now it's considering the legitimacy 
of Miranda warnings in a post·9I11 world. 

The two sides before the Supreme Court 
consist of the city of Oxnard, Calif., backed by 
the U.S. Justice Deparonent, and the blind 
and paraplegic farmer Oliverio Martinez, 
backed by the American Civi l Liberties 
Union. 

On Dec. 4, the Supreme Court heard the 
case of Cbavez u. Martinez, with the govern-
ment appealing the decision of the 9th U.S. 
Circuit Court of Appeals and arguing that 
there is no absolute Fifth Amendment right to 
be free of coercive interrogation. 

So who will win? More importantly, who 
should \vin? 

The facts of the case are as follows: 
On Nov. 28, 1997, Martinez was on his 

bike when he was stopped and frisked by twO 
police officers who then found a knife on him. 
A struggle ensued, with the officers claiming 
that Martinez went for their guns, and 
Martinez was shot. One bullet rendered 
Martinez blind; four more bullets struck his 
legs and back, paralyzed his legs. Martinez 
was then handcuffed. While in the ambu-
lance, Sgt. Ben Chavez began a taped interro-
gation \vithout giving the Miranda warning. 

According to the Associated Press' Dec. 2 
report by Linda Deutch, Martinez is heard 
screaming on the tape, "I am dying! .. . What 
are you doing to me?" For the next 45 min· 
utes, Chavez continued his interrogation, 
even after being asked by Martinez to stop 
and being instructed several times by the 
medical personnel to leave. 

The 9th Circuit Court held that Chavez 
should have known that questioning a man 
who had been shot five times, was crying our 
for medical treaonent and had been given no 
Miranda warning was a violation of his consti-
rutional rights. The court concluded that the 
confession was coerced and that it could not 
be used as evidence against Martinez in his 
excessive· force civil case against the ci ty. 

Upon examination of the Justice 
Department's friend·of-the-court brief, it is 
clear that the government is using the 
Martinez case as a jumping board to introduce 
its objectives to reduce all constitutionally 
perceived obstacles - i.e. the Miranda warn-
ing - in its continued \-Var on Terrorism. 

An expert quoted in tile AP article men-
tioned above stated, "A ruling that minimizes 
defendants' rights would be useful to the Bush 
administration .. . in its questioning of terror-
ism suspects. II 

The government argues that the decision 
of the 9th Circuit Court's "[recognitionl of a 
broad new right to be free of coercive ques-
tioning irrespective of the use to which result-
ing statements are put ... creates a serious risk 
of chilling the responsiveness of law enforce-
ment when it matters most - in the face of an 
immediate threat to public safety." 

Translated into todays security-conscious 
context, the government's argument is cen-
tered on one main principle: empowering and 
enlarging the federal government's arsenal in 
its War on Terrorism so that nothing, not 
even the constitutionally required Miranda 
warning, can interfere with the use of all avail-
able means to go after a suspected terrorist to

EdWu 

Dr. Barbara Sawrey, chairwoman of the UC Academic Senate's Board of Admissions, recently penned a let-
ter to a certain publication and addressed 
the UCSD division of the Academic Senate 
to express her belief in the success and relia-
bility of comprehensive review of under-
graduate applicants. Perhaps in a rather vain 
effort to quell the perceived quality differ-
ences between the UC campuses, Dr. 
Sawrey pointed out that "all eligible appli-
cants are still guaranteed a spot on at least 
one of our campuses," and "the selectivity 
rate is not the sole or best indicatOr of qual-
ity." 

Dr. Sawrey points out one of the fallacies 
of undergraduate education: Conrrary to 
popular belief, at the level of universities 
that all the UC campuses fall into, under-
graduate programs are not going to vary sig-
nificantly in quality, especially in engineer-
ing and sciences. Regardless of whether you 
are an electrical engineering major at 
Berkeley or at Riverside (or, for that matter, 
at an Ivy League school), the course materi-
al over four years is going to largely be the 
same: differential equations as a sophomore, 
linear systems as a junior, etc. And given that 
the vast majority of students hardly 
approach a command of the material in any 
given course, and that srudents across the 
system all use simi lar textbooks, it seems 
that the breadth and quality of undergtadu-
ate education has much less to do with what 
particular University of California a srudent 
attends and more to do with his or her work 
ethic in any given place. Professors who are 
not at the top of their respective fields can 
probably teach undcrgraduate material as 

Sat 12/7 
10am-Spm 

effectively as professors who are at the fore-
front of their field; after all, undergraduates 
are generally not learning research-level 
material. 

Arguably, this does not hold as true for 
majors with less ri gid curricula tl\an the sci -
ences; one would hope , at least, that 
UCSD's much-vaunted politica l science fac-
ulty would translate into better undergradu -
ate courses. However, people who can teach 
well are hardly correlated to those whose 
research records are laudable, and since the 
Universities of California are first and fore-
most research institutions, one mi ght sur-
mise that the best teachers (if not the best 
researchers) are randomly and somewhat 
equitably distributed anyway. If anyone has 
any doubt as to whether the UC system val-
ues research or undergraduate education 
more, one need only look to how lechlrers 
are treated by the university. 

This being said, however, Dr. Sawrey's 
statement is misleading in some way; selec-
tivity in and of itsel f is probably the most 
important indicator of another SOrt of qual· 
ity - that of the undergraduate populace at 
any given school. Regardless of how politi-
cally correct we wish to be in our vague def-
initions of what constirutes worthwhile indi -
viduals to admit to an undergraduate institu-
tion, it is an inescapable fact that it is 
extremely likely that the student populace at 
Berkeley is more driven and more informed 
(if not necessarily more inrelligent) than that 
at Davis or Santa Cruz. And for an under-
graduate who is faced with the prospect of a 
nearly homogenized education across the 
various UC campuses, the selectivity rate is 
the best indication of the quality of the peo-
ple you'll be around for the next four years. 

Thus the selectivity rate of a school is a 
means in and of itself; the way the olltside 
world perceives a university and the way sru-
dents at the university itself view themselves 
is intrinsically tied to how and how many

Iraq: Bush 
must avoid 

usual rhetoric 
of aggression 

Ephedra~based drugs' danger is real 
Dependence on drug can have unforeseen consequences 

contin tied from /Jllge 4 
developments instead of forging 
ahead with his usual characteristic 
rhet ric. 

If, in fact, Hussein continues to 
be compliant with U.N. demands 
and does relinquish whatever 
stockpile of deadly weapons or 
contagions he has, Bu h should 
give credibi li ty to Hussein's actions 
instead of pi ugging !-ti s ears and 
going ahead with military action 
anyway - a scenario that may 
prove to be likely, since Bush 
seems very intent on moving in on 
Hussein. While the fact is that 
Hussein has a long history of 
dodging and cheating out of oblig-
ations, it is now more important 
for Bush to evaluate instead of 
jumping in . 

Especially in the midst of a still-
unstable atmosphere with an 
arguably still-strong terrorist 
threat (as proven in last week's 
Kenya attacks), Bush should 
rethink any belligerent gesture 
before embarking on it; t!-tis is his 
last chance. 

The next week ' and coming 
month are crucial for Bush and his 
agenda on Iraq. Between now and 
then, Bush should take one hard, 
last look at what may work beSt for 
all interests. 

Afterward, whether the deci-
sion is to back up his previous 
tance or back away, he must be 

resolute in his final decision. After 
dragging the issue back to the 
table, he cannot afford to scream a 
few condemnations and finish it 
off.

[t is estimated that Americans 
spend over $17 million a year on a 
class of products called diet supple-
ments. With record numbers of 
overweight citizens in the United 
States, coupled with a preternan,r-
al cultural obsession with lean bod-
ies, it's no wonder. Unfortunately, 
the hope offered by diet aids that 
contain ephedrine is a false one. 

In the same way that euphoric 
drugs offer a better state of mind 
only until the drug wears off, the 
weight loss and increased energy 
achieved through ephedrine is only 
temporary. It cannot be sustained 
after cessation of the drug without 
the same lifestyle changes that 
would have facilitated that weight 
loss in the first place. But like any 
drug that makes life easier, 
ephedrine becomes a crutch, a 
"lifestyle drug." The Web site for 
Herbalife, a provider of one 
ephedrine product, has the slogan 
"Herbalife ... a way of life" beneath 
a picture of a beautiful, smiling 
family. Unfortunately, this lifestyle 
comes with a wide range of serious 
side effects, and the very real pos-
si bili ty of drug-related fatality. 

Ephedrine speeds up and ulti-
mately overworks the heart and a 
host of other bodily processes, 
much like methamphetamine with-
out the full manic psychological 
kick. This has been experienced by 
many users as an uncomfortable 
thumping in the chest and pulsing 
throughout parts of the body. Yes, 
this is legal, and users shouldn't 
worry about law enforcement. Even 
if they start feeling an overwhelm-
ing, urgent energy or scattered

After going off 
ephedrine, users 
often gain more 
weight back than 
they lost and have 
a higher body fat 
index because the 
body adapts to 
store fat more effi-
ciently and devotes 
less energy to tasks 
like muscle-build-
ing. Withdrawal 
from ephedrine 
also often includes 
a spike in appetite, 
similar to the food 
cravings that a 
smoker can get 
while kicking the 
habit, because the 
brain and body's 
natural hunger 
mechanisms have 
been recalibrated. 

However, a user 
might be somewhat 
bothered by the 
host of unpleasant 
side effects that can

changes that begin simply with 
alterations in heart rate and blood 
pressure can lead - sometimes 
quickly - to myocardial infarction, 
hypertension, strokes or seizures. 
Different sources give different 
numbers, but the Food and Drug 
Administration has filed 81 report-
ed deaths associated with ephedrine 
alkaloids between 1993 and 200 I. 
Given the recent rise of these prod-
ucts and the fact that their use is not 
moni tored by the medical profes-
sion in an organized fashion, severe 

variety of recep-
tors and hormones, such as insulin 
and leptin. When a stimulant like 
ephedra is introduced to the body, 
these systems slowly become more 
sensitive to counteract the appetite-
suppressing effects of the drug, and 
re-establish their ability to commu-
nicate nutrient needs to the individ-
ual. Ironically, this personification 
of the human body might seem a 
little heavy-handed, since cells don't 
have desires in the same way that 
individuals do. But evolution has 
offered strong incentives, through 

gies you need 

the famines and seasonal scarcities 
that plagued humans through most 
of their history, to develop metabol-
ic and hunger mechanisms that are 
responsive to a variety of circum-
stances. The idea that such a com-
plex system could be bypassed by a 
pill is ludicrous. 

Unfortunately, in a world of 
taco shops and candy aisles, many 
of these mechanisms do more 
harm than good. Like quick-fix 
diets, diet pills can set off a chain 
reaction in the body that will leave 
the user with a more persistent 
weight problem in the long term 
than before the use started. 

According to 
http://www.ephedrine-newr.com. 
Americans consume three billion 
doses of ephedrine each year in the 
form of not just pills, but also 
sports drinks and food supple-
ments .. Dozens of products contain

By far the most popular is 
Metabolife, .whose annual reported

ing ephedrine-based diet pill . 
Customers might not even know 
they are ingesting an ephedrine 
product because the ingredients do 
not list the active drug, but the 
herbal source: ma huang. The 
Metabolife Web site gushes not 
about its stimulant drugs, but its 
"thermogenic herbs." The public is

is safe or even healthy because it is

Speak: Government can't 
be trusted with our rights 

Childbearing future in question 
By CLAIRE J. VANNETTE 

Opinion Editor 
Though I neve r thought I'd agree 
with Dr. Laura Schlessi nger on 
anything, I can't see being happy 
with allowing my infant or tod-
dler to be raised by nannies, day-
ca res and baby itters; either my 
putative husband or I would have 
to stay at home with allY children 
until they were nearly ready for 
school. And the likelihood of me 
pursuing a career that allows me 
to take severa l years off while my 
family is still financially solvenl, 
or finding a co-parent (husba nd, 
best friend , whatever) who could 
and would do something similar, 
seems small.

stop a potential arrack. 

The distinction the government 
tries to make is that as long as the 
confession is not used to incriminate 
the suspect at trial, and is used for 
other purposes, it must be allowed. 

Don't be fool ed, for the govern-
ment's bottom line is far more sinis-
ter - the govermnent is essentially 
demanding that if the Supreme 
Court persists in keeping the 
Miranda safeguard, it must recog-
nize a terrorist exception to the 
Miranda warning. 

Clearly, the govermnent's solu-
tion to preventing further terrorist 
attacks is to JUSt throw out the con-
stitution when it comes to those 
individuals suspected of terrorism. 

But who is a terrorist? And who is 
rightly bestOwed with a terrorist 
label- one who is guilty or one who 
is accused? It seelns that all it takes 
under the Bush administration's 
framework is mere suspicion to erase 
your fundamenta l rights. 

But what happened to "innocent 
until proven guilty'" Will that con-
stitutional safeguard also be exempt-
ed for those who, rightly or mistak-
enly, fall under suspicion of being a 
terrorist' If so, where does this free-
fall of fundamental rights end? 

To entrust the government with 
such limitless power is so inherently 
dangerous that it takes either a 
moron or a despot to even contem-
plate such a reckless act. 

Governments have consistently 
shown themselves to be 
unreliable custodians of our funda-
mental rights, which is why the 
framers of the Constitution fash-
ioned the Bill of Rights as a hield 
against arbitra ry, dangerous powers. 

Our Constitution has successfully 
weathered a bloody Civil War and 

two world wars, yet now it must be 
allowed to crack and be dismantled 
for the War on Terrorism to be suc-
cessful? 

What a bunch of rubbish. 
The hysteria may have dimin-

ished since 9/11, but the scars and 
insecurities remain. It is upon this 
legacy of insecurities that the gov-
ernment now preys, until all that we 
will be left with is a mere skeleton of 
our original Constitution. 

To be free from coercive gov-
ernment interrogation is an 
absolute right guaranteed by the 
Fifth Amendment and must 
be upheld. Even in the face of 
impending terrorist attacks, our 
constinltional rights must remain, 
for once exceptions are made for 
one class of people, the right has 
been comprOlnised for all and it is 
only a matter of time before anoth-
er cut here or there will render the 
right completely useless. 

The forecast, however, is decid-
edly grim with the current Supreme 
Court, which will likely carve out a 
terrorist exception or completely 
tossing Miranda. This constitutional 
betrayal will have chilling fallout , 
without a way to reverse it. So don't 
be surprised when we finally awaken 
from our 911 I-induced slumber to 
find all tllat remains is a hollowed-
out ghost of a Constitution. 

Then all that will be left to do is 
hold a memorial service for the 
Constirution who e death certificate

My mother had her third 
daughter at 3:02 p.m. on Sunday, 
a beautiful girl named Lilah 
Margaret who weighed eight 
pounds, 10 ounces. Both mother 
and baby are doing well. 

Since I've been giving this lit-
tle recitation to friends and fami -
ly this week, there's been an inter-
esting array of responses, from 
"Mazel Tov'" to "What color is 
her hair?" to "Hcrw old is your 
Mom, again'" But the biggest 
head-scratcher came from a 
friend in Seattle, who asked, "So 
how does this make you feel about 
having kids?" 

I was unaware that the experi-
ence was su pposed to change my 
outlook on children. Lilah's birth 
was not the first I'd attended. I 
was the videographer at the birth 
of my 2-year-old sister, Sadie, and 
got an eyeful of what the "miracle 
of childbirth" does to a 39-year-
old woman's lower half (it ' ain't 
pretty). My mom trained to be a 
midwife when I was a kid, so I was 
knowledgeable about the process 
and had been present for a few 
deliveries. 

There is always something 
arresting about being faced with 
the improbable but undeniable 
fact that where there was once one 
woman grunting and sweating on 
a bed surrounded by frantic nurs-
es, there is now one sweaty 
woman, several frantic nurses and 
one tiny, perfect little creature 
with absolutely no idea what's 
going on - no memory, no pre-
conceptions, no desires (except for 
warmth and comfort), no histOry. 
Its journey is sta rting right there, 
and the inherent seduction comes 
from the knowledge that you can

shape that journey. 

I've been on tile fence about 
having kids of my own for years . I 
adore my sisters, and playing with 
Sadie is supreme stre s relief, even 
when she's bouncing off the walls 
or throwing record tantrums. 
Holding Lilah this week, watching 
her struggle to open her dim eyes 
and feeling her absurdly small fin-
gers wrap about my clumsy thumb 
is lovel y. And the idea that some-
day, I might have a little person 
who belongs to me, whose journey 
I can shape however I want to, is :1 
powerful draw. 

But I'm pretty old-fashioned 
when it coml'S to how I want to 
raise my theoretical children.

Horse: More study places are needed 
continued from page 5 

students are admi ned. To some 
degree, comprehensive review 
undermines the credibil ity of that 
selectivity rate by using standa rds 
that are neither entirely objective 
nor academic. Whether or not this 
is a problem is an issue of much 
debate th at this writer is torn over. 
For as much that can be said about 
the value of diversity and the sac-
ri fice needed by this society to 
create true equality of opportuni-
ty, university students are served 
very well by peers with compara-
ble prior bodies of knowledge and 
life experiences. 

Thus, while academic opportu-
nity may be the same across the 
campuses, the same caMot be said 
for the opportunities for intellectu-
al and emotional developments, of 
which the nature of one's peers is 

crucial. Because for every person 
who adds [Q the student populace at 
a "selective" University of 
California because d1ey bring a 
unique and interesting background 
to the universi ty may mean one less 
person selected on more stringent, 
"objective" criteria who may con-
tribute precisely because he is simi-
lar to everyone else there. And 
which of the two is more valuable to 
UCSD's undergraduate populace? 

T he 24 hours of CLICS during finals week is no doubt a valuable and 
thoughtful gesture that h~s become 
immensely popular. Unforumately, 
the study rooms at CLICS are also 
extremely popular and perennially 
filled . One wonders whether the 
small classrooms in Center Hall 
and Warren Lecture Hall could be

ments of different herbal prepa-
rations can have wildly different 
yields of ephedrine, and the man-
ufacturer is not required to 
report this information. Since ma 
huang is a naturally occurring 
herb, it is not regulated by the 
FDA with regard to its risks as a 
drug, unless it can be proven in 
court that it is a health risk. 

On Aug. IS, the U.S. 
D epartment of justice bligan its 
criminal investigation of 
Metabolife, the leading manu-
fac turer of weight-management 
products that derive their effi ca-
cy from herbal ephedrine 
sources. T he suit's foc lls is on a 
collection of 13 ,000 complaints 
that Metabo li fe has received 
from its customers on a hotline 
it established to give "weight 
loss advice." The FDA has been 
attempting to obtain th ese 
records for years, even fi ling a 
criminal suit when Metaboli fe 
claimed that no such complaints 
existed . When the company 
fin ally handed over the calls, 
they claimed that they did not 
turn them over earlier because 
"three experts reviewed this 
information and determined 

that the information does not 
demonstrate that Metabolife 
356 is unsafe or poses any health 
problems when used as direct-
ed." In other words, the compa-
ny felt that three reputed experts 
in its own employ had the 
authority to determine if a drug 
is safe for the entire U.S . popu-
lation to consume. 

If this sounds a Ii ttle 
unorthodox, it is because the 
FDA, a large government 
bureaucracy with hundreds of 
scientists and statisticians, usu-
ally puts drugs through a rigor-
ous battery of tests that can take 
years to complete before it ca n 
be determined whether a drug is 
safe enough to be available over 
the counter, regulated by a doc-
tor's prescription or ba nned 
from sale in the U.S. entirely. 

If the diet pill companies' bla-
tant lies, retrac tions, conceal-
ment of evidence and protection 
behind the plant/drug distinction 
seems somehow fa miliar, it is 
because the tobacco companies 
went through the same process in 
America's courts . Like Big 
Tobacco, the Big Diet industry is 
making billions on a dangerous 
product with elusive benefits.

THURSDAY. DECEMBER 5, 2002 THE UCSD GUARDIAN NEWS 9 

Adion: Michigan applicants allege reverse discrimination Elections: 
continued from page r 

lawed racial quotas. 
Two potential students of the 

University of Michigan's College of 
Literature, Science and the Arts, 
jennifer Gratz and Patrick 
Hamacher, and one potential law 
smdent, Barbara Gruner, have filed 
a suit against the university claiming 
th3t their applications were judged 
harder than those applications 
received from students of color. 

Potential applicants at the uni -
versity are evaluated on a ISO-point 
scale based on their LSAT scores, 
grade point average and other vari-
ables. While a white student will 
receive one point for having a good 
essay, a student of color wiII receive 
an extra 20 points for being a 
minority. 

However, the Center for 
Individual Rights, the parry repre-
senting the prosecution, believes 
that the University of Michigan's 
policy toward admitting minority 
students is a violation of Title VI of 
the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which 
bans all forms of racial discrimina-
tion in federally funded universities. 

Court records about the 
University of Michigan'S law school 
cite that while a white applicant 
with an LSAT score of 165 and a 

GPA between 3.25 and 3.49 has 
about a 22 percent chance of 
admission, a minority student with 
similar marks is almost guaranteed 
entry. 

Gruner had a 3.B GPA, scored 
161 on the LSAT and had started 
her own consulting firm by 1996 
when she applied to the law school. 

These issues do not affect 
UCSD because Proposition 209, 
which prohibits discrimination and 
granting preferential treatment on 
the basis of race, was passed by 
California voters in 1997. 

"Race cannot be considered in 
the awarding of public benefit," 
Vice Chancellor of Smdent Mfairs 
joseph Watson said. "I am not a 
lawyer, but I don't think th:lt the 
Supreme Court is going to decide 
that race must be considered, and 
that would be the only way that 
they could reverse the California 
decision," 

Many UCSD students believe 
that these policies are unfair to oth-
ers who deserve admittance to the 
universi ty. 

"While affirmative action may 
provide opportunities for under-
privileged minorities, it is counter-
productive for universities because 
it does not necessarily ensure the

most qualified students will be 
admitted," said John Muir College 
senior Steven Reis. 

Watson, however, said that 
many students of color do not have 
the necessary resources available to 
them to be successful. 

"The real issue is that many stu-
dents of color don't have the same 
opportunities," he said . "Many 
don't have access to the same qual-
ity education." 

Affirmative action cases also 
take past and current racial dis-
crimination into account, which 
Watson said should be a factor in 
deciding this case. 

The U .S. Court of Appeals, 
where Gruner lost her case before 
the successful appeal to the 
Supreme Court, believes that affir-
mative action is a necessity in keep-
ing the number of minority stu-
dents high. 

The court reported that without 
special allowances given to minori-
ty students, only 4 percent of the 
incoming class of 2000 at the 
University of Michigan would have 
been granted admission. This is 
compared to the 14.5 percent that 
were accepted that year under their 
admission regulations. 

A similar Wesleyan University 

smdy reports that black students on 
many campuses would drop below 
2 percent if such minority advance-
ment ended. To many UCSD stu-
dents, this statistic is evi dence of a 
much larger societal problem . 

"1 think that affirmative action is 
just a temporary solution to a major 
problem in society," said Thurgood 
Marshall College sophomore Sam 
Maghsoodoo. "Lowering the bar 
for certain groups in university 
admissions is just a cure for the 
symptoms of a problem that needs 
to be solved at the root." 

These factors will be discussed 
by the nine Supreme Court mem-
bers, who in the past have been 
split on the issue of race. Four of 
the current members - Antonin 
Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, Clarence 
Thomas and Chief justice William 
Rehnquist - have historically 
opposed affirmative action, while 
john Paul Stevens, David Souter, 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen 
Breyer have all been in favor of 
such policies. 

The ninth member, Sandra Day 
O'Cormor, stands to be the decisive 
vote in this issue, since her decis.ion 
will most likely create a majority 
for either stance and subsequently 
decide the Supreme Courts ruling.

Holiday: Students donate to drives 
continued from page I 

the A.S. Volunteer 
Connection Office, UCSD 
Bookstore's first floor lobby 
and EDNA. There will also 
be bins at the Pancake 
Breakfast from 7 a.m. to 9 
a.m. at Price Center 
Ball room. 

T he Winter Wear 
Donation Drive is being 
conducted for the fi rst time 
this year by the UCSD 
Women's Center and the 
Lambda T heta Nu sorority. 
Coordinators are currently 
looking for donations of 
used jackets, sweaters and 
blankets to go to immi-
grants crossing the deserts. 

According to the sorori-
ty, they are trying to prevent 
the deaths of hundreds of 
immigrants who perish in 
the desert each winter. The 
sorority is working in coor-
dination with the San 
Diego-based Waterl\Vinter 
Stations, which started twO 
years ago by leaving water 
out in the desert for thirsty 
immigrants crossing the 
Mexican border and is now 
leaving clothes and blankets 
in the winter. Lambda 
Theta Nu is a sorority that 
promotes the advancement 
of Latinas through various 
campus activities and com-
munity services. 

Rosario Parra, a member 
of the Lambda Theta Nu 
sorority, said that the idea 
came from one of her soror-
ity sisters, who met Enrique 

Morones, president of the 
Water/Winter Stations 
Project. 

"My parents came here 
[to the United States] and 
sacrificed a lot for me, so it 
hits close to home," Parra 
sai d. "It's very personal for 
all of us, so it's our way of 
giving back." 

T he Water/Wi nter 
Stations Project has been 
under controversy since its 
inception, raising criticism 
from various border patrol 
groups and community 
members. 

"They say we're aiding 
people to cross the border. 
but we believe it's a humani-
tarian action," Parra said. 

T he sorority will be col-
lecting donations at the 
Women's Center through 
Dec. 13. 

T he Women's Center is 
also conducting a food drive 
to benefit the Community 
Resource Center in 
Encinitas. According to 
Loren Linscott. program 
coordinator for the 
Community Resource 
Center, the food collected 
will be distributed to 700 
low-income local families 
on Dec. 13 and Dec. 14. 

Non-perishable food 
items can be dropped off at 
tile Women's Center until 
the end of the quarter. 

Another yearly holiday 
tradition is the UCSD 
Umbrella Group's adoption 
of a UCSD Medical Center 

patient-family in need. 
"We have a tradition of 

adopting the fami ly wi th the 
most children and trying to 
meet and exceed their holi-
day wish list," said Adopt-A-
Family Coordinator Rich 
Belmontez. 

This year. the adoptive 
fa mily is a low-income, 
eight-child family. One of 
their children has been a 
cardiomyopathy patient at 
the UCSD Medical Center. 
Items on their wish list 
include a microwave and 
grocery store gift certifi-
cates for the parents, and 
clothes and toys for their 
sons and daughters, whose 
ages range from five months 
to 16 years. T he full wish 
list can be obtained through 
the A.S. Council Web site 
or at the Lesbian Gay 
Bisexual Transgender 
Resource Office, where 
donations will be coll ected 
through Dec. 9. 

Another Adopt-A-Family 
program was conducted for 
Thanksgiving by the A.S. 
Volunteer COImection. 
which adopted 55 families 
this year through donations 
by individuals and student 
organizations on campus. 
According to Taing, most of 
these people will continue to 
adopt their family for 
Christmas, and the 
Connection is still encourag-
ing anyone to contact their 
office to adopt a new family 
for this holiday season.

"Analyze That" 
Stars: Robert de Niro, Billy Crystal. _ 
Story: Mob boss Paul Vitti (De Niro) winds up in Sing-Sing. and his loony behav-
ior in prison has the FBI wondering whether it's all an act to get released early 
or whether the big guy has finally cracked. As a resul~ Dr. Ben Sobel (Crystal), 
Vitti's trusted psychotherapist, is brought in. It turns out that Sobel could use a 
little couch time himself; he's dealing with his fathe~s death and a serious iden-
tity crisis. His life becomes even more stressed when Vitti is released into his 
care, becoming his patient (again) and houseguest. 
Outlook: The sequel to "Analyze This: "Analyze That" will definitely do very well 
at the box office with its great acting and witty script. Expect this movie to be one 
of the best of the year. 

12.1J.02 
"About Schmidt" 
Stars: Jack Nicholson, Hope Davis. 
Story: With no job, no wife and no family, Warren Schmidt (Nicholson) is des-
perate to find something meaningful in his thoroughly unimpressive life. During 
this darkly comic and painful odyssey, Schmidt details his adventures and shares 
his observations with an unexpected new friend and confessor: Ndugu Umbo, a 
6-year-old Tanzanian orphan whom he sponsors for $22 a month through an 
organizarion that advertises on IV. From these long letters filled with a lifetime 
of things unsaid, Schmidt begins - perhaps for the first time - to take a glimpse 
of himself and the life he has lived. 
Outlook: What's "About Schmid( about? It is rumored that it is about to gamer 
Nicholson a Best Actor nomination. With phenomenal acring and great directing 
by independent filmmaker Alexander Payne, no one should think twice before 
shelling out for this tragicomedy. 

12.18.02 
'The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers" 
Stars: Elijah Wood, Cate Blanchett, Orlando Bloom, Liv Tyter. 
Story: The sequel to " Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Rin~s" follows the con-
tinUing quest of Frodo Baggins and tfie Fellowship that has jOined to destroy the 
One Ring and stand against the evil of the da~ lord Sauron. The FeDowship has 
divided and finds itself taking different paths to defeat Sauron and his allies. 
Destiny leads them to the two towers: 0Ithanc Tower in lsengard where the cor-
rupted wizard Saruman awaits, and Sauron's fortress at Barackjur, deep within 
the da~ lands of Mordor. 
Outlook: Although the rumored ~ time is 179 minutes. a tnIe fan should 
not be deterred from seeing !his film (it is only a ninute longer than the previ-
ous LOTR film). Gorgeous cinematography anc:I a fast~ plot should keep 
the audience from getting bored, trarislating to another box office success.

"The Antwone FISher Story" 
Stars: 0eteIt Luke, Jov Bryant, Denzel Washington. SaIIi Richardson

Hold on: Mob boss Paul Vitti (Robert Deniro) gives his doctor (Billy 
Crystal) a taste of his own medicine. 
tor, he confronts his painful past and begins a quest to find the fam-
ily he never knew. 
Outlook: "The Antwone Fisher Story" just might tum out to be one of 
the year's hidden masterpieces. A true drama, this film will deliver in 
every sense, proving Washington's directorial capabilities.

"Rabbit Proof Fence" 
Stars: Everlyn Sampi, Tianna Sansbury, Laura Mongahan, Kenneth

Sttwy: The setting is Western Australia in the early 19305, where

.T ori Amos to serenade RIMAe Arena 
Talented musician returns to UCSD to play during winter break 
By CLAIRE J. VANNmE 

Senior Staff Writer 

Trying to explain a Tori Amos concert to someone who is not a Tori devotee is like trying 
into explain sex to a virgin: You 
can't really express how inspiring, 
how emotional, how passionate it is 
without sounding a little silly. 

Those who are followers of the 
red-haired priestess and swoon at the 
sound of her music know that sex is 
an apt metaphoric realm when talk-
ing Tori. Amos often sings about sex; 
salacious song lyrics include "So you 
can make me cum, that doesn't make 
you Jesus," "Got an angry snatch," 
"Gimme peace, love and a hard 
cock," and "Boy, you better make 
her raspberry swirl." And then 
there's "Icicle," a song about a young 
girl masmrbating while her fa mily 
prays downstairs. Amos is also an R-
ra ted performer, bumping and 
grinding with her piano bench and 
purri ng and moaning through spirit-
ed sets while wearing filmy dresses 
and tossing her auburn locks. 

And Anl0S' audiences' reaction 
to all of this' Orgasmic. 

Concert-goers throw them-
selves at AnIOS' feet and show their 
adorati on with tears, sighs and cat-
ca lls, and Amos feeds off this ener-
gy and produces a show worth 
nearly any ticket price. She's known 
for peppering her set lists with 
quirky covers of everything from 
Nirvana to The Beatles, improvis-
ing song alterations on the spot, 
and never neglecting old standards 
like "Cornflake Gi rl " and "Silent 
All These Years," which always put 
the crowd in a frenzy. If ever an 
audience and an artist were making 
love, they do at Amos' concerts. 

Sex, it should be noted, is out of 
the spotlight on Amos' newest 
album, "Scarlet's Walk. " Though 
the entire album is underlaid by a 
pulsing sensuality, the "soni c 

Concert 
PREVIEW 

novel," as Amos calls it, is a reac-
tion ro the attacks of Sept. 11 - an 
exploration of America through the 
eyes of a character named Scarlet, 
an everywoman looking for her 
soul in OUf wild and wooly country. 

Don 't expect tribute songs about 
fallen heroes or flag-waving solidar-
ity: One of the most provocative 
tracks on the album is the first, 
"Amber Waves," in which America 
is compared to a wayward porn star. 
The album's lyrics, sometimes con-
versational and often inscrutable in 
the grand Tori tradition, find a nice 
summation in the title track: "'what 
do you pl an to do with all your sro-
ries'J the new sheriff said, / quite 
proud of his badge / we'll weave 
them through / every rocket's red 
glare / and huddled masses." 

T he album's sound has been 
descri bed as a remrn to the girl-
and-a-piano act of "Under the 
Pink" and "Boys for Pele," but the 
pop sensibility shown on "To Venus 
and Back" and "Stra nge Littl e 
Girls" lingers; the songs have less 
narrative force than her rambling 
orchestral pieces of yesteryear, and 
are catchier and less memorable. 

Amos brings her Bosendorfer 
and her small band to RIMAC Arena 
on Dec. 13. Opening for Amos on 
this tour is the relatively unknown 
Howie Day, whose single, "Ghost," 
has been getting airplay on 
MuchMusic and whose cover of The 
Bearles' "Helpl" appeared on the "I 
Am Sam" soundtrack. He's noted for 
being easy on the eyes and challeng-
ing to the ears, laying down souJfuI 
vocals over acoustic guitar and 
intriguing samples and loops. 
Though he may be unsatisfying to 
the more rabid Toriphiles frothing in

thei r seats, his act should ease listen-
ers into the act as gentl y as fo replay. 

RIMAC Arena's nearly 5,000 
seats are sold out for the concert, but 
tickets can be acquired on eBay for a 
reasonable price. T he venue should 
be suited to Amos' and Day's inti-
mate songs (there 's not a bad seat in 
the house), but watch for acoustics to 
cause problems. Seats wi ll cover dle 
floor, and concert-goers will proba-
bly be asked not to stand during the 
show, so don 't expect a mosh pit -
but don't expect anyone to be in his 
seat when the curtain drops.

Dave Attell's 'Insomniac' is waking up 
Attell continues to relieve the sleepless in third season of hit show 

By BILLY GIL 
Staff Writer 

Dave Attdl knows that his show is no "West Wing." Ask him about his successful late night 
comedy show, "Insomniac with 
Dave Artell," and he's likely to say, 
"I t's a cross between 'Girls Gone 
Wild' and 'Cops.'" As the show 
enters its third season, Attell 
remains realistic about the success 
and the limitations of his show. 

"In a sitcom, like '7th Heaven,' 
they get to try it many different 
times 'til they get the right 'Father, 
what's wrong?'" Attell says of the 
unscri pted nature of the show. "I 
can't do that." 

Of course, there is some sort of 
method to the madness of 
"Insomniac." The show starts with a 
brief snippet of AtteUs comedy act in 
the city in question, then follows him 
as he roams through the local bar 
scene and mingles with the towns-
folk, concluding with Attell spending 
quality time with various night-shift 
workers. Attell , an avowed alcoholic, 
says that he has seen every drunk sit-
uation imaginable, so the night jobs, 
from sewage treatment to airport 
runway workers, are the most inter-
esting part for him. 

The new season of "Insomniac,» 
which premieres Dec. 5 at 10:30 
p.m., will feamre AtteU in a variety 
of new situations and locations, 
such as probing the haunted 
Shanghai Tunnels in Portland, Ore. 
Upon hearing about apparitions of 
prosti mtes, Attell asks, "What does 
a dead hooker say? 'Boo! Let's 
Party?'" 

Courtesy of htrp:/l_comecIycenIJOLcom 
up late: Dave Attell, host of Comedy 
Central's show "Insomniac: prowls 
around late for the fun of it. 

Attell's down-to-earth but 
eager~to-please attitude propels the 
show. He mixes well with people 
from every wa lk of life, from 
drunken bikers to bored college 
kids. Credit his respect for "Iate-
nigh t people" and his will ingness to 
poke fun at him elf along the way. 

Of course, "immersion" might 
be a better word to descri be this 
relationship. Attell is constantly 
dodging buJlets while firing them at 
the same time, some of them aimed 
at himself. In one instance, Attell 
makes a few midget jokes because 
he claims that his best friend is a 
midget. A diminutive, drunken 
woman becomes visibly angry with 
him, and Attell is forced to call in a 
"little security." Later, he is back to 
making fun of his "rolls oHat." 

Attell gives off the feeling that 
this is what he loves doing and 
would be doing it even ifhe weren 't 
getting paid. 

"It's the comic lifestyle," he says. 
"In the 'Seinfeld' movie, he doesn't 
end up drunk at a Denny's, talking 
to a toothless waitress." 

In many ways, hosting 
"Insomniac" is a dream job for 
Attell. He briefly landed a job in 
the '90s working for "Santrday 
Night Live," but he knew it wasn't 
where he belonged. 

"I wanted a job where I traveled, 
but I thought it would be exotic 
places like Thailand and Hong 
Kong," Attell says. "I didn't know I'd 
be going to like, Boise, Idaho, or 
Dayron, Ohio." So "Insomniac" 
basically combines all of Attell's 
loves : traveling, socializing and 
boozing. Attell says that the show 
has probably run its course, but he 
seems content to continue with it as 
long as Comedy Central will let him. 
With an M1V contest on the way in 
January, in which "Insomniac" will 
pay a visit to the winner's hometown, 
and a new season that takes him all 
the way to Europe, it seems that 
Attell will be spending all the late 
nights he wants running amuk with 
bikers and hooker-ghosts.

StaH Writer 

X box Live, Microsoft's newest entry into the world of online con ole gaming, is a service 
that allows you to compete over the 
Internet against other people from 
arOlmd the world. Not all games 
out for Xbox are supported - at 
launch time o nly nine games were 
- but they represent a nice genre 
mix, from shooters to sports to 
party games. The unit costs $50, 
which gives you a one-year sub -
scription, a headset for voice com-
munication and demos of two 
games: "Whacked!" and "Moto 
GP,' both playable online. The 
first year of service is included wi til 
the Live package you purchase, but 
the price scheme for subsequent 
years hasn't been revealed yet. 

Before you run out to the near-
est electronics store and grab your 
copy, make sure you realize that 
Xbox Live will only work over a 
broadband network, such as a 
cable modem or the connection in 
UCSD's dorms. In addition, the 
speed of your connection makes a 
big difference - a cable modem at 
home works great, but the lag-rid-
den connection in the campu 
dorms can make for a lot of inter-
rupted games while you wait to 
ca tch up to the other players' con-
nections. 

With that sa id, if you have a 
fast connecti on, Xbox Live will 
undoubtedly be something you 'll 
want to add to your Christmas list. 
£t 's fun, it's inexpensive and you'll 
never have to settle for playing the 
boring, single-player Xbox again if 
your friends aren't around ... or if 
you don't have any fri ends. 

Most interesting is the replay 
abi liry of games, such as "NFL 
Fever 2003 ," becomes nearly infi-
nite when you ca n test your strate-
gies on new people and learn from 
their strategies. "Talking trash" 
has never been easier. Garnes like 
"Unreal Championship," where 
the testosterone flows freely are 
great for Xbox live; you can liter-
ally talk real-time trash with the 
included headset, making it all 
that much easier to rub a victory 
in an opponent's face. 

In addition, the nine games 
currently available for Xbox Live 
represent the best of their genres. 
"Unreal Championship" is either 
the best or second-best shooter 
game on the console, with "Halo" 
being its only competition; and 
because "Halo" lacks Live sup-
POrt, if you want to play a grea t 
shooter online, its going to be 
"Unrea l Championship." Tom 
Clancy'S "Ghost Recon" is anoth-
er shooter that comes with Live 
support, and offers a more strate-
gic game-play experience than 
"Unreal's" run-and-gun action, so 
shooter fans will have their choice 
of styles and games. 

While Xbox Live is an incredi-
bly fun and inexpensively priced 
service, it isn't without flaws, such 
as the a forementioned lag issues. 
If your Internet connection is slow 
when you surf the Internet, this 
probably will result in little fun 
when usi ng the Live service, 
becduse when the game really lags, 
the voice system becomes unus-
able, and that really is the service's 
most interesting feature. In addi-
tion, people won't want to play 
you because you'll slow down 
their games. 

( marivaux' ~ ) 

It is overly complicated to acid 
someone to your friends list, a fea-
mre that lets you see if people YOll 
have chosen to play with are online 
or not so you can easi ly contact 
t1lem for games. Also, installing 
Xbox Live on your Xbox seems to 
make it less stable, and in tests, the 
Xbox loner unit reviewed by hiams 
crashed multiple times, something 
a console should never do. 

Registration requires a credit 
card after purchase, which leaves 
some kids SOL and forces you to 
remember to cancel your subscrip-
tion if you're unhappy after a year. 
Also, ome view the game selection 
at present as very limited, with only 
nine choices that may not even be 
games people wouJd be interested 
in playing. At the top of this list are 
the included games, "Whackedl" 
and "Mota GP," both of which 
have very limited game-play fea-
rures, and if it weren't for the voice 
chat online, wouJd get tossed aside 
after an hour. However, these pre-
spective garners should be aware 
that many more games will be 
released with Live support in the 
next few months. 

TIle Xbox Live service is experi-
encing growing pains at the 
moment and still has a lot of bugs to 
be ironed out. Mjcrosoft seems very 
committed to making it the most 
enjoyable experience it can, and so 
far it has started out with a great 
product. Overall, if YOll have an 
Xbox aJld a decem Internet connec-
tion, the plusses far outweigh the 
minuses for lv1icrosoft's Xbox Live. 
The allure of playing people all 
over the world, learning new strate-
gies for games or just talking trash 
from the comfort of your couch are 
tOO strong to pass up for $50.

While roaming around New York

takes a closer look at his life. 
Outlook: Spike Lee's latest project

money and deligh t audiences 
around the world. 

12.27.02 
"Chicago" 
Sla,'s: Renee Zellweger, Catherine 
Zeta-J ones, Richard Gere, Queen

Flynn (Gere), to set her free . In 
the center of the town 's most

Fabulous acts to close the quarter at the Price Center thanks to A.S. 

By CLAYTON WORFOLK 
Staff Writer 

With fall quarter all but wrapped up and winter break on the horizon, UCSD is 
(debatably) ready for a party. Enter 
Ozomatli, whose multicultural 
block-party blend of salsa and hip-
hop wili hit the Price Center Dec. 6 
with the A.S. Council's first free 
"Thank Goodness It's Over" con-
cert of the year. 

Smooth, jazzy and always 
danceable, Ozomatli's music is as 
eclectic as its musicians. Despite 
several lineup changes since the 
band's debut (including the depar-
ture of Jurassic 5's Cut Chemist and 
Chali 2na), Ozomatli remains a 
diverse conglomerate with roots in 
many musical genres. Jiro 
Yamaguchi (percussion), Wil-Dog 
Abers (bass), Justin Pon!e (percus-
sion), Asdru Sierra (trumpet and 
lead vocals), Raul Pacheco (guitar 
and lead vocals), Ulises Bella (tenor 
sax and clarinet), Kanetic Source 
(MC), Andy Mendoza (drums) and 
DJ Spinobi (turntablist) round out 
the free-form group. 

Ozomatli came together in Los 
Angeles in the mid-'90s and 
released their self-titled debut on 

Concert 
PREVIEW 

Universal's A1mo Sounds label in 
1998. On it, the band established a 
distinctive sound apt to flow 
between several musical styles in 
the course of one song. The album 
earned Ozomatli both cri tical 
acclaim and popular renown, allow-
ing the band to tour and play 
around the world with the likes of 
Santana and Los Lobos. 

Ozomatli's latest release, 
"Embrace the Chaos," similarly 
highlights the band's dedication to 
musical amalgamation, combining 
pachanga, samba and other world-
beat forms with salsa and hip-hop. 
While Kanetic Source and DJ 
Spinobi fill the void left by Chali 
2na and Cut Chemist well, guest 
appearances by Medusa and 
Will.I.Am of the Black Eyed Peas, 
Pos and TruGoy of De La Soul, 
and Common help fill out the hip-
hop elements of the album. 

Ozomatli's music is undeniably 
party-based; however, it is not 
without a purpose. The band prides 
itself on its connection to urban 

America and other dispossessed 
peoples throughout the world, and 
as such, activism is an important 
dynamic of their music. Ozomatli 
regularly plays benefit shows and 
last year participated in the protest 
of the Democratic National 
Convention in Los Angeles, per-
forming one song before being shut 
down by police. The experience 
inspired the title track of "Embrace 
the Chaos," which opens with a 
demonstra tor's pleas to the police 
to stop firing rubber bullets, 
recorded during the breakup of the 
protest. 

Friday's concert is the first of 
three A.S. Council-sponsored 
TGIO shows planned near the end 
of each quarter. Ozomatli will be 
joined by San Diego locals the B-
Side Players and trip-hop group 
Peak Show. The concert begins at 
7:30 p.m. and is free to students 
with a valid UCSD ID.

I ~ IIiATU, THE U D GUARDIAN 

Rajasthan is a hidden gem for the intrepid traveler 
Everyone will be pleased with the plethora of activities from camel riding to great food 

By NEHA SINeH 
Staff Writer 

This winter break, I am leaving behind crowded malls, elves, Santa C laus and the general 
holida y frenzy to take a plane to 
India. Granted, it does nor have 
the festive holiday spirit found 
only in the western world at this 
time of year, but if you k.now 
where to 'I ook, you will ' fi nd some 
gorgeous sights and entertain-
ment. 

Raja sth.l n, one o f the most 
be'luti ful states in India, literally 
means " lJ nd of [he kin gs .''' 
Conseque ntl y, one will fi nd 
dozens of towns with breathmki ng 
pala ces and fo rts. Some towns 
worthy of mention arc Jod hpur, 
J ,l isal mer, Udaipur and Pushkar. 
There 'Ire no intermltional air-
ports in [he sta te, so most tourists 
tly in to New Delhi and take a train 
to Rai asthan's capi tal, Jaipur. T he 
train schedule within Rajas than is 
"er)' ir regular, so it is recommend-
ed tha t one hire a car and a chauf-
feur to sightsee. 

Jod hpur stands sentinel to the 
ThaI' Desert and is a gateway to 
rh e wonderland of sand dunes and 

shru bs, rocky te rrai n and thorny 
trees, It is the second-largest city 
in Rajas than after J aipur. The 
exquisite palaces, fortS and temples 
are a huge aruaction to people 
from all over the world, A sight 
not ro miss is the enormous 
Mehrangarh fo rt, which overlooks 
the entire city and is characterized 
by its exquisite architecture, 
Although the town is very small 
with its narrow streets, it is alive 
with throngs of people, 

r\ few hours' d rive from 
Jodhpur is Jaisalmer, also known as 
the Desert Paradise. T he perfect 
rime to visit this golden city is dur-
ing the Desert Festival, held in 
January and February. This time 
every year, the city reverberates to 
the sounds of melodious tu nes and 
rhythms. Folk dances, exciti ng 
competi tions and contests like the 
turban-tyi ng contes t and camel 
races enlighten the fes tivi ties , An 
often-missed sight is the J ai almer 
fo rt, which is over 800 years old 
and protected by 99 turrets. If 
time allows, one should also visi t 
the numerous havelis - unbeliev-
ably striking man sions built by 
weal thy merchants in the past few 
centuries.

Giddy up: Tourists ride camels accross the sand dunes of Jaisa lmer in the 
northern state of Rajasthan in India. 

A stark contrast to Jaisalmer is 
Udaipur, the City of Lakes, It is 
nestled in the valley among lush 
hills of the Aravallis, on the banks 
of the shimmering lake Pichola , It 
is one of the most romantic cities 
of Rajasthan with marble palaces, 
beautiful gardens and placid blue 
lakes. This city boasts City Palace, 
the largest palace in Rajasthan and 

one of the largest in the world. A 
spectacular palace within the City 
Palace is Sheesh Mahal, with inlaid 
mirrors everywhere. A notable 
hotel in Udaipur is the Lake Palace 
Hotel, which is one of tile best in 
the world. It is an old palace in the 
middle of a lake that has been con-

THURSDAY, DE EMBER 5, 2002 

don't pop 
my sheep 

Jessica Kruskamp 

S urrounded by pre-pubescent girls and boys on hand to idolize Gwen Stefani of 0 
Doubt, ensconced in my free-for-
the-press concert seat at Cox 
Arena, watchi ng Brody Armstrong 
of The Distillers, I had It, T he 
realization. 

J want to show my black bra 
strap onstage. I want to be up there 
in bondage pants. I want to bc a 
hellion. [ want to "sing" like I have 
had no formal training, H ere it 
comes folks - T he rea lization, 

I want to be a knock-down, 
hard-core, cooler- than-cool fema le 
in a band. G irls rock' Mohawks 
anyone? 

The inner bartl e was getting 
ugly, One side of me said, "No, 
sorry girl. YOll are a college student 
who has finals coming up, and you 
JUSt do not have the attinlde. " T he 
other side of me spurted fo rth a 101 
of expletives, threw the bird to 
some grandmother in the crowd 
(who was wondering when 
G arbage would hit the stage), and 
then shaved my head. 

Well , fi guratively speaking, of 
course. 

Bear with me - [ am rewinding 
back to last Tuesday at t he 
Distillers/Garbage/No Doubt con-
cert. Though it seems the estrogen 
would be running h igh in this H oly 
Trinity of female frontiers, it most 
certainly was not. T hese wom en 
cou ld kick my ass fo r sure, I'd be 
willing to bet that they coul d make 
mincemeat out of 80 percent o f tile 
crowd, all the while blotting the 
sweat off their faces so th eir make-
up wouldn't run (as the Gwen-
meister did at least five times dur-
ing No Doubt's set). 

They are part o f the tough , too-
coo l, attitude-driven female band 
members whose breed seems to be 
growing, 

There 1 was, my meager linle 
self, in total and abso lute awe of the 
attitude that was emanating from 
the stage, I got to hear Shirley 
Manson of Garbage say "bitch" a 
lot, saw the ladies sweat, cuss and 
generally rock the stage with their 
male band members, 

As the show wore on and Gwen 
strutted the stage, I had some major 
introspection. Though I wanted to 
show a hint of the 01' bra strap and 
be up there, I don't think I could 
handle gyrating on a catwalk like 
Gwen, or flouncing around in a 
urn-tard (yes, apparently they sti ll 
make those) and polka dot tutu like 
Shirley. 

But, the little hamster on the 
wheel in my brain sped up a little 
bit. Now is the time for me to 
become this on-stage female alien 
of myself. All the girls are doing it 
- whether they are on the mic, 
manhandling a guitar or manning 
the drums. Peer pressure, man (Hal 
Man!). The ladies are everyone. 

This recent wave of real women 
musicians into the music scene is 
hearti ly welcomed. 

Can I be one? That's all I want 
to know. 

Well, I'm a complete introvert, 
So J started to mentally explore my 
options to be in a band, It dawned 
on me about the time No Doubt 
launched into "Just a Girl." I don't 
necessarily have to front the band. 

Duh. 
I could be the Meg White of the 

White Stripes. She's ultra-cool , 
never speaks, hardly smiles and I 
have never seen her strut a catwalk. 
She throws her hair around the way 
I imagine Mozart would on the 01 ' 
piano, and is a major force in a 
back-to-basics duo; she has no 
small role as one half of a band , 
Though her drumming style is 
rather simple, she sti ll drives much 
of the White Stripes music. I could 
handle tha t.

THURSDAY, DECEMBER 5. 1002 THE UCSD GUARDIAN HI ATU ' I I} 

India: A fabulous place to journey to 
continued from {JlIge ,8 

vetted to a hotel, with luxurious 
rooms and an excellent restaurant. 

Only a few hours away from 
J aipur lies Pushkar, a peaceful town 
in the mountains bui lt around a lake, 
It is a religious town, with lots of 
stunning Hindu temples and 
shrines, The city is famed for its 
beautiful sunset on Lake Pushkar, 
and all the buildings are painted 
white so that the brill iant reds and 
pinks can be reflected o ff thei r walls. 

A well -known place in Pushkar 

is the Sunset Cafe, a spot where 
people can relax, have dinner and 
watch the sunset over the lake. 
Ove rall, Pushkar is a hidden gem -
anyone going to Rajasthan should 
include it in their travel plans. 

A good source for finding out 
more information is the Rajasthan 
Tourism Development Center. 
This state-run organization has 
hotels all over Rajasthan, and they 
often organize tours on camels, ele-
phants, trains or buses. They offer 
very reasonable travel packages, 

including food and accommoda-
tions . RTDC is tailored to help for -
eigners and to make their stay in 
Rajasthan as enjoyable as possible, 

On the whole, a trip to 
Rajasthan is one of the most mem-
orable things anyone can do in 
their lifetime. The sights are mag-
nificent, the people are charming 
and traveling is cheap - it fits just 
about every coll ege student's cri -
teria for a good trip. It will be nice 
to follow up final s wee k with a trip 
that is both re laxing and fun . 

As an engineer in 
the u.s. Air Force, 
there's no telling 
what you'll work on. 

Sheep: Contemplating today's pop stars (Seriously, we can't tell you.) 
continued from page 18 

If I could, you know, play the 
drums, 

Onto the next option: The 
Donnas, First of all, what the heck 
happened to them? They are slim-
mer, polished and (hold your hats) 
on MTv. Second, despite all of 
that, they still rock, 

I could be anyone of them, 
Donna one, Donna two, Donna 
three or Donna four, Even the 
lead Donna isn't too over-the-top 
for me, and the other Donnas 
hold up their ends of the band 
better than well . 

The Donnas are in the process 
of becoming a major rock band , 
Expect to hear their songs on the 
radio more frequently, with their 
harmonized backup vocals and 
hard rhythms, 

I would have fit in slightly bet-
ter before The Donnas turned 21, 
when they were still based in the 
Bay Area (myoid stomping 
grounds) and weren 't quite so 

marketable. But hey, I could still 
pull it off. 

That is, if I had talent. 
OK, another option who is 

singing her way up to No. 74 on 
the Billboard charts is our very 
favorite foul-mouthed Kelly 
Osbourne, I can swear like a 
sailor. She does what she wants, 
which doesn't sound like too much 
of a stretch for me, 

Singing on an MlV awards 
show seems a little intimidating, 
but at least she's modest about it 
- not much skin, regular clothes 
and a comfy pair of Converse. I've 
heard voices that are worse, and 
she has a good stage presence. r 
could handle that, 

If, of course my dad was a pro-
fessional musician - and didn't 
just play guitar in the garage after 
work with his cronies, Or if my 
mom wasn't a preschool teacher, 
and could instead put together a 
record deal for me . 

Despite the personal musical 

. ~ .. 

naws that should keep me off the 
stage and out of bondage pants, 1 
realized at that concert that I 
longed to be up there, Not neces-
sarily in the spotlight, but up 
there . Being onstage as an aggres-
sive member of a band who hap-
pens to be female and kicking 
some boo-tay is incredibly entic-
ing, 

Mohawks anyone? I thought 
so, 

And that's that. Lack of instru-
mental dexterity and talent aside, 
attitude and band here I come. 
Right now, the music world has a 
good crop of female teachers, and 
r am a willing student. I can multi-
task. College and being a female 
force in a band? No prob l 

Brody, Gwen, Shirley, Meg, all 
four Donnas, Kelly and Jessica, Ahh, 

Please, whatever you do, let me 
have this immature, unreal, sad 
dream, and let me show my bra 
strap, Please, don't pop m y inflat-
able sheep of a bubble,

Artificial Ufe: Bouldarl. betw .. a biology aad computation? 
Profs. Bel .. & TrllSch 
Section AOO, ID1I472153 I eSB 180, 10:00am -11 :50am 
AIt.rnaUng Wednaday., .'artlng January 15 
Artificial Life (Alife) is a scientific enterprise intrigued by the idea of "Life" 
as a principle of organization, rather than just defining it in terms of the 
biological forms we happen to see on this planet. We will discuss both 
general issues(computational, biological and cultural evolution) and specific 
Alife methods and issues(cellular automata, pattern formation) . Possible 
texts include Levy's "Artificial Life" and Kurzwe~'s "Age of Intefligent Machines" 
and "Age of Spiritual Machines." 

The arlin In the Media: From Stem Celli to Ecstasy 
Prof. Aadna Chlba 
Section BOO, 1011472154 I eSB 272, 3:30pm - 4:20pm 
Wednesdays, weekly, starting January 8 
Articles from popular press that focus on brain science will be discussed. 
Discussions may include an analysis of the scientific, eth ical, historical and 
cultural content of the articles. Each student will be expected to bring a 
relevant article to class on their assigned day and be prepared to discuss it. 
Neural Networks: Comp.ters that Work like Brains 
Prof. Jeff Elllln 
Section COO, IDI# 472155 I CSB 280, 5:00pm - 5:50pm 
Wednesdays, starting January 15 
Is the human brain really just like a very complex computer? Does it really 
work like your PC? Could there be a computer thai learns on its own? In 
th is seminar we wil l learn about "Neural Networks", a new kind of computer 
architecture that works using the same principles as the human brain, The 
seminar will involve readings, discussion and hands-on experience designing 
neural networks .

THURSDAY, DECEMBER S, 2002 THE UCSD GUARDIAN SPORTS 21 

Division I: Move to D .. I may not help UCSD gain money from sponsors 
continued from page :12 

move to Division 1 will require an 
additional substantial increase in the 
athletics program budget. 

One option available through a 
Division I sports program is 
increased attention from the media. 
With that focus would come more 
fans and better opporrunities to gen-
erate money through advertising and 
sponsorships, but not in San Diego. 

"San Diego is a town that already 
has a number of pro teams, two 
other D-l schools and it's a soft mar-
ket for entertainment," Grosse said. 
"TIleres just too much to do here," 

Television market ratings sup-
port Grosse's assessment. Though 
San Diego is the seventh-largest 
city in the United States, it has only 
the 26th-largest television market. 
Ranking ahead of San Diego are 
much smaller markets, including 
UC Davis' metropolitan 
Sacramento market at No, 19. 

Unless a wealthy UCSD alumnus 
offers to step in with a generous 
donation to the athletics depart-
ment, it appears that students will 
have to foO( the bill for any move up 
through an IIlcrease in srudent lees. 
Widl dlC current overcrowding on 
campus, wluch is only prOjected to 
get worse, many students feci that 
all)' increase in fees should first go 
toward other propmed pr jects , 

Final Four: 
Tritons hope 

to contain 
Azevedo 
continued from page 22 

to their scorers, " 
Azevedo led the Cardinals this 

season with 90 goals. The 6-foot-5-
inch Hudnut was third on the team 
with 42. By comparison, UCSD's 
twO top scorers this season were 
Jonathan Hopkins and Clark 
Peterson, who had 62 and 33 goals, 
respectively. 

Stanford twice played and beat 
UCSD eariier this season by a 
combined score of 24-9. 

"Between the two teams, myself 
and Clark [Peterson] are going to 
stay on Azevedo and try to slow 
him down, " Man Ellis said. "If we 
can hold him to twO goals or less, 
that will be good." 

With their ga me plan, the 
Tritons do not seem discouraged or 
intimidated by Stanford. 

"We're well prepared," Onken 
said. "Our coaches have done a 
great job. I'm excited to get up 
there and show what we can do. 
We're the underdog, but I look at it 
as they have to beat us and prove 
that they're better then us. I feel 
like we can play with these teams 
just like anybody else ," 

The NCAA Championship 
semifinal game starts on Dec. 7 at 
noon in Los Angeles. The champi-
onship and third-place games will 
be played on Dec. 8.

such as expansions of the Price 
Center and the Student Center. 

"Last years referendum signaled 
an upward swing of athletic support 
on campus," said Jordan Cross, who 
served on the athletics referendum 
committee. Cross noted the differ-
ences between UCSD and UC 
Davis, which recently passed a 
major referendum to support its 
planned move. "I do not believe that 
UCSD students would be support-
ive of the much more expensive 
move to D-1," he said. 

Though UC Davis and UCSD 
appear to be similar at first glance, 
there are clear differences when it 
comes to location and financial pri-
orities. UC Davis recently passed a 
fee similar in structure to UCSD's 
failed Campus Life Referendum 
fee. Students voted to increase fees 
by more than $100 per quarter, 
with a majority of the fee going to 
support the move to Division I. 

UC Davis also currently offers 
athletic scholarships at the Division 
n level, and intends to increase the 
number of scholarships offered in 
Division L 

UCSD, on the other hand , is 
not located in a small f,mning com-
munity, and has many other outlets 
for entertainment besides sports. 

Tom Ham , a local restauranteur 
and supporter of the shon-lived 

UCSD footba ll program in the 
1960s, once said that UCSD would 
have no future in San Diego if it 
did not move toward a "big-time" 
athletics program immediately. 

UCSD scrapped its football 
program after the winless 1968 sea-
son. 

Since then, UCSD has changed 
and grown by leaps and bounds. In 
1970, UCSD boasted slightly over 
4,000 students. The latest figures 
from the registrar's office indicate 

" Everything about our pro, 
gram is heading in [the 

Division I] direction ... " 
- Robin Shelton, A.S. 

Commissioner of Athletics 

23,548 students enrolled in UCSD 
,his fall. Academically, UCSD has 
- in just 42 years - developed an 
international reputation that much 
older institutions with well-known 
sports programs can only drea m of. 

Whether or not the lack of a 
big-time sports program had a 
hand in the university's acadenllc 
climb to the top is debatable. Some 

feel that UCSD would have gone 
the way of USC had it followed 
Ham's proclamation. Others feel it 
would have done no harm to 
UCSD's academic prowess. 

Rega rdless of the past, many 
feel that it makes sense for the ath-
letics program to keep pace with 
the rest of the university. 

Shelton believes the athletics 
program is keeping up with growth. 

"Everything about our program 
is heading in [the Division I] direc-
tion in terms of the success and 
class of the operation," he said. 

If there's one thing that UCSD 
has always excelled at, it's innova-
tion. From the founding of Revelle 
College in 1960 to the recent cre-
ation of the new management 
school, the campus as a whole has 
always strived to develop and 
change in a successful yet unique 
fashion. 

The athletics department has 
followed a similar pattern, refusing 
to bow to the trend of emphasi zing 
big sportS like basketball while Cut-
ting others to ma1llta in a balanced 
budget. 

"They do " fantastic joh with 
what tlley have," Shelton said, who 
works closely with administrators at 
the athletics deparnllent as pan of 
IllS p sition on A.S . Coullcil. "The 
atlli euc director [Ea rl Edwardsl and 

by order of 

his entire administration and coach-
es do an amazing job wh.ich I think is 
evident in their success," 

For now, even though some sta-
tistics indicate otherwise, Di\~sion 
II looks like the best tit for the 
Triton athletics program. It's wha t 
a majority of students want. But 
with the constant rehashing of 

CAA regulations and the chang-
ing student body, the situation will 
be vastly different in the future. 

Already, the newest UCSD stu-
dents are examining athletics and 
coming to different conclusions. 
Eleanor Roosevelt College 
Freshman Senator Max Harrington 
thinks current students "would 
financially support a move to 
Division I because of the enhanced 
status and prestige that it would 
carry." He also beli eves students 
would support athleti c schoLlr-
ship, but he also noted other 
pressing issues on campus such cl, 
funding for club pons and stud~1ll 
organizations.

Volleyball plarers 
earn recognition 
Ohta, Hogan and Wilsons 

named to All .. CCAA teams 
By BRYCE WARWICK 

Staff Writer 

The UCSD women's volleyball 
team received recognition after 
four of its players were named to 
the All -Ca lifornia Collegiate 
Athletic Association teams for their 
performances in the 2002 sea-
son. 1\\'0 sophomores - outside 
hitter Bonnie Wilson and setter 
Teresa Ohta - were named to the 
first tcam, while senior middle 
blocker Jennie Wilson and sopho-
more middle blocker Karie Hogan 
were named to the second team. 

O hta followed up last year's 
Pacific Region Freshman of the 
Year honors with an equally 
impressivE' campaign. She com-
piled 1,06 assists, averaging 12 per 
game, and was second in the CCAA 
in both categories. Ohta also fin-
ished seventh in the conference in 
digs, averaging 3.43 per game. 

O ne of Ohu's favorite targets all 
year has been dynamic newcomer 
Bonnie Wilson. Since transferring 
from the University of New 
r fampshire this season, Bonnie 
Wilson has been a focal point of 
UCS D's offense. She finished 
fourth in the conference with 403 
ki lls and ried for second on the team 
with 33 service aces. YVhile she said 
the award is lIice, Wilson said that 
being named to the A11-CCAA team 
is not something she aimed for. 

"I personally don't go into a sea-
son saying, '[ want to win this,'" she 

said. "You hope at the end that all of 
your work will payoff and people 
wi ll recognize you as a good player." 

Bonnie 'Nilson's older sister, 
Jennie \Vilson, also had a strong 
year. T he senior's all-around game 
allowed her to lead the Tritons in 
service aces, as well as be among the 
teams top three in kills and blocks. 
Without her teammates, though, 
Jennie Wilson knows her success 
would not have been so great. 

"Playing with such good players 
just makes you better," she 
said. "When you see someone else 
doing so well , it just pushes you to 
that next level." 

Joining Jennie WIlson on the 
A11-CCAA second team, is middle-
blocker Hogan, UCSD's leader in 
blocks. Hogan notched 92 blocks 
on the season while ranking sixth in 
the conference with a .320 attack-
ing percentage. De~pite her strong 
play. Hogan insists she was sur-
prised at the honor. 

"1 didn 't expect anything like 
that," she said. "It makes me that 
much more excited about next sea-
son because it gives me something 
to build off of. It's something to try 
to reach again next year and the year 
after. " 

Just as each of the players will 
look to improve on this season, 
UCSD will look to come back next 
year even stronger. But for now, the 
players have some rime to sit back 
and appreciate the recognition that 
they've earned.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Basketball: A ztecs set record against UCSD 
conrinued from page 2 4 

UCSD go just two for nine from 
tlle floor while SDSU rut half of 
its first 16 shot attempts. 

H owever, the real story of the 
game came from behind the three-
point arc. After Triton junior for-
ward C.). Duffaut made a long-
rang connection to cut his team's 
deficit ro 36-24 with four minutes 
remaining in the first half, SDSU 
made three consecutive three-
pointers, with two coming from 
freshman guard Steve Sir and 
another from senior guard 
Deandre Moore. That quickly 
pushed a 12 -point Aztec lead to 21 
points, and the first half ended ,vith 
SDSU leading the Tritons 47-24. 

In the second half, UCSD con-
tinued to allow perimeter shots 
when its zone defense sagged off 
SDSU guards to defend the Aztecs' 
taller players near the basket. At 
the 15:40 mark of the second half, 
Sir hit a three-pointer, and then 
Moore converted on another the 
next time down the floor. After 
SDSUs Tony Bland made a 10-
footer, the Aztecs hit two more 
treys, and they broke thei r previous 
record of I 3 threes made in a 
game. In all, five different SDSU 
players contributed to the team's 
total of 16 three-pointers in its 30-
point rout of the Tritons. Sir, who 
finished the game with 18 points, 
was six for 10 from behind the line. 

UCSD played a solid game, 
considering it was playing against 
the toughest opponent that it will 
face all season . The Tritons found 
high-percentage, open sho ts 
against the bigger Aztecs .on the 
offensive end of the court. In fact, 
UCSD hit 16 of its 28 anempts 
from inside the three-point line. 

T)1er Huff/Guardian 
Picking up experience: Triton freshman forward Sean Crockett had two assists 
and two rebounds in 12 minutes of playing time in his first collegiate game. 

"Our offense revolves around 
two things: three-point shots and 
lay-ups," said Triton head coach 
Greg Lanthier. "We are able to 
get those good opportunities 
because we have the ability to 
shoot the three." 

Leading UCSD were junior 
guard Sean Crawford and sopho-
more center Jordan Watkins. 
Watkins was seven for II from the 
floor on his way to scoring IS 
points and grabbing five rebounds. 
Crawford also contributed IS 
points to the Triton offense, and he 
had twO steals on the defensive end. 

Going into the game, UCSD 
was not expecting anything more 

than gaining experience. 
"It is good experience for us to 

go and play a team as tough as 
ISDSU] . Anyone that we go play 
from here will definitely be a step 
down," Lanthier said. 

Looking ahead to the rest of the 
season, the Tritons have been care-
ful to set reasonable goals, and the 
pre-season polls predicted UCSD 
to finish last in the conference. 

"We should always be picked 
to finish last. We don't offer ath-
letic sc holarshi ps, and our 
entrance exams are difficult, " 
Lanthier said. "We are much bet-
ter than last year, though . Our 
realistic goal is to finish .500."

ick Ellis has allowed 6.3 goals

but the goali e has given up 8.3 per

games, two of which were losses. 

"Frankly, he hasn't played very 
well lately," Matt Ellis said of his 
older sibling. 

The Cardinals, IIIho have been 
crowned NCAA champions nine 
rimes, got into the four-team

High hopes: The Tritons are confident that they can knock off nine-time NCAA 
champion Stanford in the two teams' semi-final match at LMU on Dec. 7. 

Athletics: UCSD doesn't have the facilities that a D .. I school should have 
continued from page 24 

nearly three times the size of the 
average Division 1 school. I t appears 
a move to the "big time" is 
inevitable, but there are a number of 
hurdles that tile program has to clear 
before it can consider such a move. 

A.S. Commissioner of Athletics 
Robin Shelton feels that UCSD is 
not quire ready for Division I yet. 

"At this current time, we are not 
rcady tn muve tn Division I, and 
would t or be prepa red to go," said 
Shelton. I former member of the 
' lI'iton golf tcam. "Currently, there 
arc things that must improve 
he fore such a move takes place." 

Shelton ci ted the lack of equip-
ment, office space and weight room 
faciliries as example of problem 
that need to be rectified before the 
program could consider a move up 
to Division I. 

However, Shelton felt that the 
most important factor in any move, 

UCSD athletes, would be prepared 
for Division 1. 

"Our athletes would be ready for 
the move," he said. "We have some 
amazing athl etes with incredible 
amounts of talent. Many peo ple 
asked the same question when we 
moved from Division III to Division 
[I. Tn our fir~t year in Division n, we 
finished fourth in the Sears Director 
Cup without any scholarships." 

Scholarships will playa large 
role in any future move. Currently, 
NCAA Division I bylaws state that 
a Division I institution mu t award 
"financial aid repre enting a mini -
mum aggregate expenditure of 
$771,000 (with at least $385 ,000 in 
women's sports)" annually. 

Notably, Division IT recently 
put in place a similar scholarsrup 
requirement; UCSD requested and 
has received an exemption. As a 
result, UCSD will conrinue for the 
foreseeable future to be the only 

Division U non-scholarship school 
in the countty. 

Given the stricter requirements 
of Division I, UCSD would proba-
bly have a tougher rime getti ng an 
exemption from scho larship 
requirements at that level. 

During the move to Division IT, 
the California Collegiate Athletic 
Association invited UCSD to join its 
membership. The department would 
likely look for a similar invitation 
from a conference when moving to 
Division l. UC Davis was heavily 
recruited by the Big West 
Conference as member o. 9, and it 
is rumored that the Big West is look-
ing for another California school to 
make its membership even. Could 
UCSD be Big West member No. 
10? 

"I think we're a long way from 
anything like that," said Associate 
Athletic Director Ken Grosse when 
asked if UCSD could follow the 

path of UC Davis. "First, we want 
to be a consistent competitor in the 
CCAA and in Division n." 

Meanwhile, since the founding 
of the campus, UCS!? faculty and 
administra tors have been consistent 
in their stance toward the athlerics 
program. In 1969, Revelle College 
Provost Paul Saltman stated that the 
fledgling sports program "is and 
should remain all extracurricular 
function. At no time should it inter-
fere with the academic or scholastic 
standards of UCSD." Saltman was 
concerned that if UCSD began 
granting athletic scholarships, the 
program would turn into a UCLA-
or USC-type football machine, 
wruch would consequently lower 
academic tandards. 

A similar stance was taken by 
the Academic Senate in April 1998 
during discussion of the move to 
Division II. The final morion 
approved by the Academic Senate 

asked that the chancellor "initiate 
the process for a smooth transirion 
to Division II intercollegiate ath-
letics with no athletic scholarships, 
no scholasric variations in admis-
sions and no use of general funds ." 

In terms of athleric scholarships, 
students have recently agreed with 
the Academic Senate. The 1997 
Division II referendum explicitly 
stated that scholarships would not be 
granted if the program were to move 
to Division II. The measure , which 
did not ask for a fee increase, passed 
by an overwhelming majority. 

Just last spring, a fee increase 
was approved to put the athlerics 
department qn solid financial foot-
ing for Division II. 

With the need for improved 
facilities, more coaches and admin-
istrators, longer tnlvel distances and 
possibly scholarsrups, any future

Pro athletes 
celebrate the 

holiday season 
with gift giving 

From the 
Front Row 

Bryce Warwick 

W ith the holiday season upon us, I decided ro see how some of the worlds 
top athlercs were celebrating and 
went to the 17th Annual Federated 
Professional Athlete Gift Exchange. 
The food was free and the music was 
loud. but the best part was watching 
the presentation of gifts. Here are the 
highlights for your reading plea UTe. 

The ew York Yankees gave the 
Portland "J ail Blazers" a set of their 
famous pin-striped jerseys. Co-cap-
tains Rasheed Wallace and Damon 
Sroudamire, who were arrested for 
marijuana possession last week, 
were plea cd with the gift. 

"Yo, these is some dope 
thread ," Stoudamire said."It's just 
roo bad Shawn Kemp ain't with our 
team anymore, 'cause he could 
have used the slimming effect." 

The next highlight of the evening 
came when U.S. soccer player 
Landon Donovan gave former San 
Francisco 4gers kicker Jose Cortez a 
gift certificate for three free lessons 
on how to kick a ball straight. 

4gers wide receiver Terrell 
Owens gave NFL Commissioner 
Paul Tagliabue a Sharpie. His sug-
gestion on where Tagliabue could 
shove the marker If Owens was fined 
for any more celebrations left the 
crowd speechless. 

The Major League Baseball Fan 
Association gave commissioner Bug 
Selig a tie to wear at next year's AlI-
Star Game. The league made it per-
fectly clear that the gift was the only 
tic that should be part of the game. 

In an odd coincidence of the 
draw, Shaquille 0' cal and Master 
P drew each other's names. Shaq 
offered to give Master P some rap-
ping lessons, and in return, Master 
P said he 'd show Shaq a few things 
on the court. either man appeared 
to be too exci ted about his gift. 

President George \,v Bush was 
in attendance, and he pulled out a 
gIft for noted Title IX supporter, 
a\piring Olympic archer and actress 
Ceena Davis. Bush reached into his 
pocket and pulled out a $100 bi ll. 
However, suddenly realizing that it 
would be unfair ro give money to a 
woman without giving the same 
amount to a man, he took out scis-
sors and Cllt preci ely down the mid-
dle of the bill giving half to Davis 
and half ro a man sitti ng next ro her. 

"This is useless now," she cried. 
"Yes," Bush answered. "But at 

least it's fair." 
The U.S. men's basketball team 

was in attendance, and it presented 
the U.S. men's soccer team with 
some extra media coverage. 

"Heck, we made up the game 
and we sti ll can't beat the rest. 
These guys are beati ng the world at 
its own game," said USA basketball 
coach George Karl. 

In an mempt to expose him to 
Americ.ll1 (\llture, Houston Rockets 
guard ' teve Francis gave rookie 
teammate Yao Ming a gift certificate 
to Starbucks. The 7-foot-6-inch Yao 
was reportedly disappointed with the 
coffee-maker's definition of "tall ."

Men's basketball drops 
opener at SDSU, 87--57 
Division I Aztecs don't have any 
trouble in disposing of Tritons 

ByANU KUMAR 
Sports Editor 

It is hard enough for the 
Division II UCSD men's basket-
ball team to go up against 
Division I San Diego State. It is 
even more difficult for the Tritons 
to hang with their cross-town 
rival when SDSU sets a team 
record for three-point field goals 
made in one game. 

time that the Tritons and Aztecs 
have faced each other, and 
SD Us latest win gives it a 3-0 
advantage in the young series 
between the two teams. In their 
first meeting in 2000, UCSD shot 
32.1 percent in a game that the 
Aztecs won 80-48. Last season, 
the Tritons hit 35.8 percent of 
their field goals while SDSU shot 
67.8 percent in its 98-53 victory.

Final Four 
Water polo to 
face Stanford 
in semi .. finals 

By OWEN MAIN 
Associate Sports Editor 

The UCSD men 's water polo 
team will try to shock the water polo 
world when it faces top-ranked 
Stanford University in the ational 
Collegiate Athletic Association semi-
finals at Loyola Marymount 
University on Dec. 7. 

The Tritons, who finished the reg-
ular season wi th a record of 19- 11 , 
went undefeated in the Western 
Water Polo Association conference 
and earned an NCAA tournament 
berth last week by winning the confer-
ence tournament. 

"I'm really fired up for this game," 
said senior goalie Lance Onken, who 
earned First-Team All-Western Water 
Polo Association honors this season. 
"People don 't expect us to win, but I 
do." 

Stanford's roster includes two play-
ers from the U.S. national team, 
including Tony Azevedo, who was 
recently featured on the cover of 
Sports Illustrated. 

Though ranked No. 1 in the 
nation, the Cardinals bring a two-
game losing streak into the contest 
against the Tritons. The two losses, 
which came in is Mountain Pacific 
Sports Federation tournament, 
dropped Stanford's overall record to 
22-5. 

"Them losing two in a row bodes 
well for us," said junior utility player 
Matt Ellis. "They've dropped two in a 
row in crunch time, and we just won 
our conference tournament. It's the 
same formula for what happened for 
us against USC [in 2000] . They're 
going to look right past us." 

Matt Ellis may know a little more 
about the Cardinals than most. His 
older brother, Nick, is the Stanford 
goalie. .
