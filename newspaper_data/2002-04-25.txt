UCSD thinks global 
with Earth Day festival 
Food, activities and free music give 
Library Walk an eco feel for the day 

MSA tries to unify students; 
Campus flyer targets Judaism 

By STEVE LEHTONEN 
Senior Staff Writer 

The Environmental Coalition 
and California Public Interest 
Research Group teamed up 
Monday to organize the third 
annual Earth Day celebration on 
Library Walk and in the Price 
Center. 

The two student groups orga-
nized a fair with various environ-
mentally concerned groups to pro-
mote awareness of environmental 
issucs and to cultivate student 
activism. 

The organizations represented 
both off- and on-campus groups. 
Other on-campus groups included 
Campus Recycl ing, the Vegetarian 
Club and the Food Co-Op. 

Organizations from the COIll-
lIlunity included the Sierra C lub, 
San Diego Bay Keeper, Altair 
Energy, Earth Friendly Building 
Products, The San Diego Bike 
Coa lition, Floresta, and Ford 
Motor Co., promoting its electric 
vehicles as part of the "Think 

eighborhood" campaign. 
The Earth Day organizers also 

brought two musical acts, Madcap 
Otis and Downpour, to Price 
Center Plaza. Scott Wong, a 
Thurgood Mar hall College junior 
enjoyed seeing Madcap Otis. 

"Madcap Otis was good, " 
Wong said . "The girl who played 
the tambourine was good. They 
were better than I thought they 
would be." 

Fans also liked Downpour, 
which will return to Porrer 's Pub 
on May 15. 

The turnout and support 
pleased organizers. Mary Chen, 
vice president of the 
Environmental Coalition and a 
Marshall sophomore expressed her 
excitement. 

"It was really successful," Chen 
said. " \¥e want to see student~ 
make the \~orld a better place and 
support Earth Day."

Publications discuss 
humor and free speech 
A.S.-sponsored roundtable brings 
campus publications together 
By KIRSTEN HUBBARD 
Staff Writer 

T he A.S. Council held a round-
table discussion Monday to pro-
mote student dialogue about 
humor, responsibility, the media 
and the implication of the First 
Amendment in rel ation to campus 
publications. 

The students attending the 
forum were divided into sma ll 
groups to discuss the subjects in a 
more personal atmosphere. 

"I think it's important to have a 
discussion like this happen," said 
Catherine AJgeri, the current A.S. 

commissioner of communications. 
"It's also important for A.S. to be 
proactive rather than just reactive." 

Matters such as particular 
UCSD publications, A.S. funding 
and sponsorship, the impact of 
these publications on the commu-
nity, and freedom of speech were all 
discussed. 

Tarleton Gillespie, a UCSD 
professor of communications who 
has taught a clas called "Laws of 
Communication and Freedom of 
Expression," was a featured mem-
ber at the discussion.

In an effort to w1ity students and speak 
out about oppression, the Muslim Student 
Association held "From Oppression ... to 
Liberation" week Apri l 22 through April 25. 

Joshua Rcubner, the executive director of 
Jews for Peace in Palestine and Israel, ga\·e ,I 
speet.:h April 22 in Center IIall litled ",\ 
Jewish Perspective on Peace In Palc'llne." 

"I wanted to transcend raCial nationali-
ty," said MSA President Ahmed Salem. "I 
was really impressed that someone of 
Jewish descent or Jewish origm could 
speak out against Israel." 

MSA member 1uslema Purlllul s,ml 
that it was time that students and faculty 
take a clo er look at the Israeli- l'al cstil1l"" 
conflict. 

"It was not until the MSA had the event 
... that I myself started studying [the events 
in IsraelI," Purmul said. 

Reubner spoke to a nearl y full Iccwre 
hall about his viewpoint on the Israeli 
Palestinian conflict. 

"Mat Israel has done ... is to sy~teIllJt­
ically destroy the infrastructure of 
Palestine and the Palestinian ecol1onw:' 
Reubner aid. "The framework that [t1;el 
\'iolence takes place in is Israel's brut.lll1l1l -
itary occupation." 

Graduate student Osnun Salah Solid he 
originally went to the speech to hear .1 
Jewish perspcctive on peace. 

"I don't think [ReubncrJ rcprc~cnt~ the 
Jewish view," Salah sa id after the ,>pcech. 
"Hc's a minority." 

Union of Jewish Students PreSltI..:nt 
David Weisberg aid that although 
Reubner represents onc Jewish perspcc-
tive, one person cannot repre~cnt all Jew .. 

"There's no one stance that the Union 
of Jewish Students takes on the brJd 
issue," he said. 

Weisberg also mentioned flycrs in the 
Price Center on April 15 that purported to 
quote frolll the T;llmud, a book of Jewish 
law. 

"These quotes arc complete fabricl-
tions," he said. 

He said that the quotes on the Ilyers 
said that J ews will keep slaves when the}' 
take over the world and that it's accepted 
for Jews to sexually abu e children. 

"This happens to the Jews, but next 
time it could be anti-Hispanic; who 
knows," Weisberg said . 

Salem said he wa nted no animosity 
between MSA and U]S and had never seen 
the flyers. 

"That's not our style: to attack Jewish 
people," Salem sa id. "\Vc never once put 
out a fl yer or campaign against them." 

Weisberg said tl1at UJS had "no I{b"

Humor: 
A.S. Council funding policy 
changed after lawsuit 
Continued from page 1 

"Freedom of speech is often 
thought of as allowing everyone to 
speak," Gillespie said. "However, 
some speech can get in the way of 
other speech." 

Algeri said that the A.S. Council 
funds campus publications but does 
not necessa rily agree with what they 
say. 

"We are trying to do our best," 
Algeri said of A.S. council sponsorship 
and financial backing o f campus publi-
cations. "Freedom of speech means all 
speech. However, it 's not that we per-
sonally support all forms of speech." 

Gillespie talked about an instance 
when he read a recent issue of the 1VJo1a. 

"I don't consider myself a person 
who is easily offended," Gillespie said 
in the beginning of the forum. "Yet 
when I read a recent issue of the Koala, 
there were moments when I actually 
had a vIsceral reaction ... 'I can't 
believe that I'm reading this,' I 
thought. I can think of theoretical jus-
tifications for this type of speech ... 
ye t I myseI f do not like to read it." 

Algeri said the California Rroirw, a 
conservative campus newspaper, initi-
ated a lawsuit against UCSD in the 
1980s, claiming the campus was biased 
in its nmdi ng of the paper. From then 
on, it was determined that A.S. fund-
ing for publications should be con-
tent-neutral. 

Recently elected A.S. President 
Jenn Brown said she came" to the 
forum to discuss the power that media 
has on campus. 

"Once there was a picture of me in 
the Guardia7l with the caption, 'Smile 
pretty," said Brown. "If I had been a 
guy, they wouldn't have written that ... 
There's small t hings people aren't 
aware enough of that matter in the 
long run." 

Muir junior Stephen KJass also felt 
that certain publications don't make 
enough attempts to be unbiased. 

"Many don't realize how much 
campus media affects people," Klass 
sa id. "It's like even those who write 
[for campus publications) don't notice 
the effec!." 

George Liddle, editor in chief of the 
Knala, also attended the forum. Liddle 
felt strongly about the alleged objectiv-
ity sought by many puhlications. 

"What is the actual value of objec-
tivity' " Liddle said. "Because, A: 
You're not [objective); nobody is. And 
B: Is objectivity actua lly something to 
stri ve for? Any publication is trying to 
hit a target audience, which, in itself, is 
subjective. " 

Eric Eveskaas, a Warren junior and 
writer for "Nightcap" magazine, also 
provided insight on the issue. 

"Freedom of speech isn 't rea lly the 
issue," he said . No one will deny that 
right. T he iss e is whether [controver-
sial publications] ca n use other stu-
dents' money to make that same 
speech. If they wanted to fund it them-
selves and get advertisers, no one can 
deny them the right to say what they 
wanted." 

Algcri outlined the factors the A.S. 
Council considers in funding a campus 
publication. 

"The level of A.S. funding for a 
publication is determined by factors 
such as how c,msistently the paper is 
published, how long it has been run-
ning and whethcr they fo llow the 
rules," Algcri said. "I had to work hard 
to make sure tile funding was consis-
tent." 

Gil lespie recognized the fact that 
there are many who feci controversia l 
campus publications, speci fi ca lly the 
KOfl/II, should not be funded with stu-
dent money. 

"Cutting funding is the easy way 
Out," Gillespie said. "There is a kind of 
frustration in a structure [sllch as 
UCSDJ where there is little room for 
students to speak. In that kind of jour-
naitsm, students feel the need to demol-
ish something in order to be heard." 

Gi llespi e offered a solution: 
"Rather than passing a law o r cutting 
funding, why not fix the campus and 
make it into a place people don't want 
to harm' Because [then) they feel that 
they belong."

BRIEFLY 
Retired physics professor passes away at 86 

Oreste Piccioni, a physicist and UCSD professor 
of physics until 1986, died April 13 in his Rancho 
Sante Fe home. He was 86. 

80m in Italy in 1915, Piccioni received a doctor-
ate degree from the University of Rome in 1938. He 
continued working there, and during World War II he 
performed an experiment on the decay of mu 
mesons in the basement of a Roman high school. 
The results demonstrated that mu mesons were not 
the mediators of the strong nuclear force. 

Piccioni mOIled to the United States in 1946 and 
continued his research at the Massachusetts Institue of 
Technlogy; Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, 
N.Y.; CERN in Geneva, Switzerland; and the Lawrence 
Berkeley Laboratory. He came to UCSO in 1960. 

Picaoni was a pioneer in elementary particle 
physics research. In 1999 he was awarded the 
Matteucci Medal from the Accademia Nazionale 
Delle Scienze of Italy for his contributions to ele-
mentary particle physics. 

Picaoni is survived by his wife Marina; five chil-
dren: Robert, Richard, Gabriella, Christopher and 
Julian; and four grandchildren.

Parking fine rates 
likely to rise soon 
Information presented to 
A.S. Council hints at increase 
By MARGARET O'NEILL 
Senior Staff Writer 

The UCSD Transportation and 
Parking Committee decided at its 
April 19 meeting to recommend 
changes for next year 's parking 
prices and procedures, as well as an 
increase in ticket fees. 

In order to fund new structures 
in Revelle College, John Muir 
College and behind RIMAC, TPC 
seeks to raise rates 9 percent each of 
the next two years and 10 percent 
each of the two years after that, 
according to A.S. Council represen-
tative to the TPC Tom Chapman. 

The recomendation still needs 
to be approved by Vice Chancellor 
of Business Affairs Steven Relyea 
who is expected to approve it, 
Chapman said. 

The first two structures -
those in Revelle and behind 
RIMAC - are scheduled to open 
in 2004 and 2005. 

Under the plan, next year, "S" 
permits for undergraduates would 
COSt $45 a month, an increase of $4 
per month from the 200 I -2002 
rate 0($41 per month. 

"B" permits, for staff and gradu-
ate students, would increase $5 a 
month to $60, and faculty "A" per-
mits would increase $6 per month 
to $70. "Rn permits, for reserved 
spaces, would increase $11 a month 
to $131. 

"S" and "B" occasional-use per-
mits would increase $3 per permit, 

"A" occasional-use permits would 
increase $4 per permit and 
night/weekend permits would 
increase $3 per quarter. 

The fees charged for parking 
ci tations will also increase dramati-
cally next year. 

A "no permit" violation or an 
invalid permit would increase to 
$40, from $2 I, while the fee for a 
improperly displayed permit would 
increase to $20 from $12 . 

Parking in an expired meter 
would increase to $35 next year; 
the fine is currently $21. 

Use of a lost, stolen, counter-
feited or altered permit would 
increase to $300, from the current 
$150, and tickets for parking along 
a red curb or by a fire lane or 
hydrant would increase to $60. 

Reserved-space violators would 
be charged $60, instead of the cur-
rent $28. 

Violations in timed zones and 
violations of posted signs would 
result in a charge of $40, an 
increase from this year's $32 . In 
addition, the fee for parking in a 
disabled space would increase to 
$350. 

Chapman said that the parking 
violation fees have not been raised 
for a number of years. 

" More people now choose to 
take the risk of not buying a permit 
and geTting the occasional ticket," 
Chapman said. 

He said he believes the increase

her excitement for the day's events 
with hope that students would 
become more involved in Earth-
protecting behavior. 

"Earth Day is a great event 
where students can realize how 
they can make a difference envi-
ronmentally in their community," 
Gibson said . "Students can do 
any small thing from recycling to 
riding their bike to school, but 
the true purpose of tllis day is for 
students to realize the large 
things they can do such as joining 
a student organization like 
CaIP]RG or Environmental 
Coalition." 

Lindsey Yeats, beach monitor-
ing chair of the campus Ocean 
Awareness Club and an Earl 
Warren College senior, found 
strong student support. 

"]t was a great day," Yeats said. 
"A lot of people showed interest in

where the flyers came from. The 
flyers, which had no stamp from 
Associated Students and thus were 
not legitimately posted, were 
taken down by U]S and other stu-
dents, Weisberg said. 

The U]S put a fuJI-page adver-
tisement in Monday's issue of the

Beach on April 27 from 9 a.m. to

The Hare Krishna group pro-
vided lunch for the Earth Day cel-
ebration. The group promotes a 
vegan diet and often provides lunch 
for students in the Student Center. 

Kevin Smith helped make and 
serve the food . Smith commented 
on the environmental relationship 
with a vegetarian diet. 

"We're a very environmental-
ly friendly religion so we support 
a vegetarian diet which is envi-
ronmentally friendly," Smith 
said. 

Floresta, a Christian envi ron-
mental nonprofit organization 
that fights deforestation and 
poverty in Haiti, the Dominican 
Republic and Oaxaca, Mexico, 
collected donations to support 
villages abroad and pl ant trees in 
the United States. 

The group goes abroad to train 
local farmers in soil conservation, 
agro-foresting and direct refor-
estation. Floresta also provides 
loans to farmers. 

Independent students also used 
the day's fervor as a chance to 
mobilize.

Weisberg said that a number of

"We just felt like it was really 
important to make a statement," 
Weisberg said.

Grad students 
should not 
receive free ride 

The A.s. Council dropped discussion of a 
motion \Vednesday that would force UCSD 
graduate students who want to attend Sun 
God tOl ay for their tickets rather than be 
admitte to the concert free of charge, as 
their underg:'aduate counterparts are. The 
matter, at the very least, is worth discussion. 
Graduate students, like all others who do 
not pay for the concert through student 
actiVity fees, should/ay for their admission. 

T he concert hel at the end of the Sun 
God Festival is not merely a perk provided 
to students; it is a servis:e that is funded 
through student fees, which are paid each 
quarter by all undergraduates as part of reg-
istration fees . The simple fact is that services 
to be rendered - whether concerts or oth-
erwise - must be paid for. 

There is no free lunch under the balmy 
sky of the Sun God. 

However, the timing of this issue is some-
what suspect. With the festival less than a 
month away, it seems that a cut-and-dry 
decision on whether to aIlow free admission 
to graduate students should have been taken 
care of in earlier planning stages. Waiting 
until three weeks before the festival's date 
would have been too obviously political. 

The reasons for making graduate stu-
dents pay seem obvious - paying for ser-
vices. In addition, we hope that if the coun-
cil votes on the measure, it will do so with-
out letting the Graduate Student 
Association's decision to opt out of the 
Athletic Fee Referendum influence its deci-
sion. Graduate students are not charged, and 
rightfully so, the $28.25 per quarter for the 
recently approved athletics fee, because they 
were not included in that referendum's plan-
ning. This matter is not the fault of the 
GSA, but of the committee that designed 
the referendum. 

But now, even though ~raduate students 
do not have to pay for the mcrease in athlet-
ics spending, including club sports and 
recreation, they will share in the benefits of 
the increase: a better athletic department. 
This is not fair, but neither is life. 

If the A.S. Council wishes to tighten its belt 
for financial reasons, that would be commend-
able. A slimmer, more transparent financial 
philosophy is a benefit to all students, but it 
would be wrong to remove that belt for the 
purpose of whipping graduate students into 
shape for not participating in the fee referen-
dum. Vindictive, reactionary politics has no 
place on this campus. 

Despite the GSA's understandable decision 
to not participate in athletics fee referendwn, 
it still should not get a free ticket to the Sun 
God concert on UCSD undergraduates' tab. 

SW1 God is the premier annual event at 
UCSD. All students - from the freshmen 
experiencing it for the first time to the 
seniors' last time to graduate students -
should attend it because it is truly a festival 
for the students, by the students. 

Overall, the concert should be appreciated 
and available to all, but not for free. If gradu-
ate students have gotten in for free in tfie past 
because of an oversight, that loophole should 
be closed. Undergraduates aU pay for their 
attendance througn registration fees and it's 
time graduate students helped foot the bill.

World turned a blind eye to the 
slaughter of thousands 

The United Nations and the United States 
must be held accountable for ignoring atrocity 

By PAR.SA BAHARIAN 
Senior Staff Writer 

April 16, 2002 is a day that will for-
ever be marked in history as the first 
time an entire government resigned as 
an act of atonement for unspeakable 
past wrongdoings. 

The Dutch government resigned 
after a report fa ulted the inactions and 
complacency of the government and 
top military brass as the catalyst that led 
to the worst single act of genocide in 50 
years. 

The Dutch government and military 
stood by and watched as the Bosnian 
Serbs invaded the safe enclave of 
Srebrenica, Bosnia and systematically 
slaughtered every man and boy in the 
area. At the end of the 10-day killing 
rampage, 7,000 men and boys were 
butchered. 

This terrible mass murder took 
place in early July 1995 during the 
worst of the Bosnia War. 

Prior to 1995, the United Nations 
had authorized the formation of safe 
zones for Muslims to live without fear 
of extermination in Bosnia; one of these 
was Srebre!lica. Thousands of Muslim 
men, women and children were trans-
ported to this safe area to be protected 
by U.N. troops. The Srebrenica 
enclave was assigned protection of 400 
lightly armed Dutch peacemakers. 

But the protection the Muslims 
relied on was nothing more than a sham 
put in place to convince the world that 
action was being taken to stop the 
genocide of Bosnian Muslims. 

What the Serbs did in Srebrenica is 
terrifyingly reminiscent of what the 
Germans did to Jews in World War II. 
Just as the Germans lined up Jews con-
centration camps, separating out the 
old, weak and young into another line 
that led to the gas chambers, so did the 
Serbs separate the Muslim boys and 
men into a different line that also led to 
their deaths. 

These Muslim boys and men were 
then savagely slaughtered, many in view 
of the very forces thar were sanctioned 

to protect them. 
The Dutch troops merely stood by 

as spectators and watched this horr ible 
atrocity unfold. Despite the desperate 
requests by the Dutch field commander 
to top military brass for air support and 
authority to engage the enemy, nothing 
was done to stop the slaughter of inno-
cents. In the face of the overwhelming 
threat of Serbian firepower might, the 
Dutch government refused to send air 
support or give the ground troops the 
required mandate to defend the inno-
cents. 

Thus the Dutch government and top 
military brass not only sold out the 
thousands of innocent people they were 
ordered to protect, but their very own 
force's need for backup to thwart the 
Serbian offensive. 

Without firing one bullet in defense, 
the Serbs rolled into the so-called pro-

Their silence and inaction 
in the face of such 

unspeakable evil is not 
only extraordinarily cruel 

and shameful, but criminal. 

tected safe area and took over. The few 
hundred Dutch soldiers were forced to 
lay down their weapons and watch as 
the Serbs began their systematic gerlO-
cide of all Muslim males. 

F aced wi th the cold, brutal facts of 
their wrongdoing in the report, the 
guilt descended with such force that the 
Dutch government eagerly took the 
gun of responsibility and ended their 
political lives. 

It took seven years for the day when 
the survivors of the Srebrenica mas-
sacre - the mothers, daughters and 
wives of the men slaughtered - finally 
achieved some measure of justice. 

But it isn't enough for the Dutch 
government to shoulder the deaths of 
the 7,000 murdered men; action must 
be taken now to right that horrible 

wrong. Though nothing can make the 
murdered alive again, the Dutch can 
assist the survivors through reparations 
and other forms of aid. Atonement 
must be made. 

Though it is tempting to allow the 
Dutch government to take sole respon· 
sibili ty for the Srebrenica massacre, 
others also must be held responsible. 
The United Nations' faulty plan to 
authorize safe enclaves, gathering all 
Muslims into one area under protection 
of a small force, actually made the job 
of the Serbs much easier. All the men 
and boys were already rounded up and 
all that needed to be done was separate 
them out and kill them. 

However, the biggest power in the 
world yet to take responsibili ty for 
Srebrenica is the United States. 

According to the April 21 
WilShington Post article by Samantha 
Power, the Clinton administration 
received a classified cable that stared 
the "alarming news" that Serb forccs 
were committing "all sorts" of atroci-
ties on the thousands of Illen they had 
taken from Srebrenica. 

[n spite of the overwhelming evi-
dence of mass murder confirmed by the 
CIA, U.S. officials turned deaf ears to 
the frantic calls from the Bosnian gov-
ernment asking the United States to use 
NATO air power to save the thousands 
of men. 

Tne United States stood by and did 
nothing when they were in the position 
to stop the mass murder that took place 
over 10 days. Their si lence and inaction 
in the face of such unspeakable evil is 
not only extraordinarily cruel and 
shameful, but criminal. 

The United States must atone for 
the large part it played in abetting the 
genocide of the Srebrenican men and 
boys. So too must the United Nations. 

The world must follow the Dutch 
example and break their collective 
silence and then accept responsibility 
for the immense human tragedy at 
Srebrenica. Only then will the souls of 
the 7,000 slaughtered innocents finally 
be at rest.

Media gratuitously throws term Ihistoric' around 
Merits of past events are largely ignored by profit-hungry institutions 
By SIMONE SANTINI 
Senior Staff Writer 

Weeks ago, our one and only 
citywide newspaper - that lighr-
house of erudition, the ineffable 
San Ditgo Union- Tribunt - com-
mented on rhe Oscars with the 
following headline : "HISTORIC 
AWARDS" (with capitali7.ation in 
the original). 

As I am not in the habit of 
watching the Oscars, I was qui te 
worried at first that by choosing 
to go our with friends on that 
Sunday night, I might have missed 
something truly momentous. 

Then, of course, I came to my 
senses: "Historic" is a term we use 
for somerhing like rhe fall of 
Constantinople: It happened in 
1456, and we're still talking about 
it . 

The Oscars, by contrast, are a 
cin em3 togra phi cally irrel evan t, 
self-celebra tory ceremony. The 
films that are rewarded consider 
themselves a success if they can 
hold the box office for three con·

Rishi Shah was the onl y mem-

ber of the Students First slate 
whom I voted for. His loss is not "u 
silver lining in the abyss." He 
would have done a great job as 
commissioner of programming. 

I looked over the three slates 
and voted for the ideals of the one 
that I most agreed with. [ have time 
to look over three slate positions 
and listen to people I meet, such as 
Shah. Like most students at 
UCSD, [ do not have the time to 
look over the 36 candidates run-
ning for campuswide positions, 
plus the half-dozen or so running 
for senator positions from each 
school. 

I found it in poor taste that you 
would mock a qualified candidate 
such as Shah to illustrate your point 
that "every candidate should be 
forccd to run independently in the 
future" so that students won't 
"place unity above intelligence. n 

Right - as soon as slates are 
abolished , students will intensely 
study each of lhe more lhan 40 can-
didates who will be running next 
year and pick the most experienced 
and competent politicians. 

The busy students (96 percent 
of the student body) will probably 
just vote as recommended by the 
GlIa1'dialls A.S . Council endorse-
ments. But hey, whatever it takes to

generation that in five years will 
have forgotten them. 

Almost nobody remembers 
what won the Oscars as little as 20 
years ago. (Don't go look it up: It 
was "Chariots of Fire.") Do the 
folks at the Unioll-Tribunt really 
think that people will be talking 
about th is year's award s ceremony 
- whatever may have happened 
in it - four or five hundred years 
from now? 

As I was pondering the likeli-
hood (or lack thereof) of this cir-
cumstance, I also found myself 
pondering the altogether exces-
sive use of the adjective "historic" 
that I have seen in the last few 
years. Luckily, I have a particular 
neural condition Icnown as "pon-
deratio subdivisa," which allows 
me to ponder two things at the 
same time. 

rt looks like hardly anything 
can happen without this or that 
pundit calling it historic. Every 
decision made by whatever third-
class poli tician happens to be 
handy for decision-making 
becomes, by the very fact, his -
toric. Every ceremony commemo-
rates a historic fact even though 

most of the time, nobody can 
remember what the fact was, and 
the people who attended showed 
up solely for the free hors d'oeu-
vres. I am sure that, were I a 
sports aficionado, I would see that 
every victory with a better-than-
average score, or against more-
than-average-odds, would be 
claimed as historic. 

If all these occasions are truly 
historic, J wouldn't want to be in 
the shoes of the next generation of 
history students. At the current 
pace, I figure that in 20 or 30 
years, grade school history books 
will come in 50 volumes - 50 
CDs in the suburbs, 10 DVDs in 
La Jolla - and studying history 
will be hell . 

It seems quite unlikely that this 
will happen, so there must be 
something wrong with the ease 
with which the adjective "historic" 
is thrown around at pretty much 
any available occasion. 

One might think that this 
peculiar habit stems from an out-
right excessive love and regard for 
history. It seems to me that the 
oppositc is true: The problem is 
but one of the consequences of 

UCSD OFF CAMPUS HOUSINI 

the postmodern crisis of history, 
of the absence of the sense of his-
tory in today's cultu re and, in par-
ticular, in the media . 

The media and society exist in 
a very compressed frame of refer-
ence, dictated in practice by the 
accelera ted needs of busi ness. 
Everything removed at a distance 
of more than six months in the 
past or future is nonexistent for all 
practical purposes - with the 
possible immunity of a few excep-
tional occurrences such as the tcr-
roriSt attack on New York, which 
can last a little longer in the mem-
ory and which might actually end 
up in the history books. 

The unlimited expansion of 
the present that is suffocating the 
past and future - the eternal illu-
sion of the end of history - is giv-
ing an enormous importance to 
the trivialities on which the media 
thrive. 

The historic value of a fact is 
very often a function of its conse-
quences on the future unfolding 
of history, and therefore can only 
be evaluated once a certain histor-
ical perspective has been achieved. 
Today we are perfectl y abl e to 

determine the hi storical weight of 
the Battle of Lepanto, a naval 
engagement between Europeans 
and Turks in 175 1, but we can't 
determine the hi storica l value of 
the war in Afghanistan. 

This attitude, of co urse, fl ies in 
the face of the exi genc ies of mar-
keting, which is concern ed with 
the immediate present. In a cul-
ture dominated by marke ting , 
such an attitude has no pl ace. 

Can you imagi ne the Vlll on-
Tl'lbll1u (or NBC or CBS) report -
ing an analysis of th e Battl e of 
Lepanto? I have seen somcthing 
of that kind in the bes t European 
press , but never arou nd here . 
French philoso pher Jean 
Baudrillard didn 't ca ll us the cra-
dic of posrmodern is m for noth -
ing. 

A historicall y grou nded culture 
is not of the postJllodern world , 
which has repl aced the fl ow of 
time with the comprehensil'c 
space of globalization, and has 
accepted [he rhythms it imposes. 

In othe r words, we believe th at 
so many thi ngs are historic not 
because we have too much memo-
ry, hut heca use we have nonc.

New Wave calls

Political debates on campus 
continue ~eeks after the end of

New Wave complaint filed against 
A.S . . Elections Manager Jessica 
Will!ams IS pending. 

1 he complaint seeks to remove

TIME End of spring quarter and beginning of sum-
mer, 2002. 

"The inspiration for this play was my 
screensaver," Henry said "It shows Texas 
death row prisoners eating their last 
meals and 1 thought, ']t would be sad if 
you worked in the prison kitchen as a 
French cook." 

She is referring to "There's No 

process startS by finding clues about the 
character in the text. Most of the actors 
had to remain very fl exible because 
rewrites were frequent and often encour-
aged. 

A lot goes on behind the scenes that 
are both familiar and unusual. Hcre are 
just a few from this year's productions:

Blackout. 
Osniches: Walk anywhere on campus 

and you are bound to see these creepy 
critters. At least, this is what the famous-
ly avant-garde UCSD Depaonent of 
Theatre & Dance would hope for. 
Posters featuring ostrich heads are all 
part of a promotional campaign to 
endorse its annual New Play Festival. 

Ranked third by U.S. Nnvf & World 
Report. UCSD's Departmcnt of Theatcr 
and Dance has garnered national recog-
nition for its distinctly innovative and 
hands-on approach. The New Play 
Festival is just one example of why grad-
uate theater in San Diego is unique. 

According to department chair Walt 
Jones, the idea of showcasing new play-
wrights was one of his original goals. "T 
always thought that the festival feeling of 
celebrating a lot of plays was exciting," 
Jones said. 

Participants in the New Play Festival 
all agree on one thing: Theater is a col-
laborative process. Any behind-the-
scenes look at a production must 
acknowledge the blood, sweat and tears 
of everyone involved. The following is a 
list of a few key players. 

Bayville in Texas," a show she apdy calls 
"a play with music and not a musicaL" 

For Jeff Hirsch, his inspiration for " A 
Handful of Earth" came from a cross-
country road trip to Califomia. "I drove 
though a lot of desert around Ariwna," 
he said. "It's such an incredibly bizarre 
10C2le. ] guess that stuck with me and 
that's where the play starts." 

Hirsch describes the collaboration 
process as a wonderful way to help a new 
vision come to fruition. 

Not as heavily fwlded or publicized, 
the New Play Showcase features two 
one-act plays written by first-year gradu-
ate students. 

"Pure" writer Mat Smart said his play 
came about while trying to decide on 
buying a Cold play album. "1 think they're 
a bad band but] like their music. I stood 
there for like 45 minutes but later won-
dered why I was worrying about some-
thing so trivia1." 

THE DIRECTOR 
Meredith McDonough finds it trick")' 

to define a director in any context. "I 
think you set the room so that you create 
an environment where people can do the 
best work they can do, and you try to 
facilitate them with your own ideas." 

For her, the discovery of a brand new 
play with the playwright and production 
crew is most fulfilling. She credits her 
amazing cast from "A Handful of Earth" 
for creating such an ideal collaboration. 

As the uptight Keith in 
"Arrangements" and the hip Milty in "A 
Handful of Earth," Corey Brill describes 
how a bad case of the giggles can wreak 
havoc on stage. 

"It's hard to keep a straight face some-
times," Brill said. "Mistakes don't happen 
often but when they do it always happens 
on lines you never expect." 

Christine Albright, who plays image-
obsessed Ros in the same play, mentions 
the virtue of crossword puzzles. They 
were a favorite pastime among the cast 
during early rehearsals. 

According to "There's No Bayville in 
Texas" actor Daoud H cidami, acting is 
"about moments." H e continues, ,·It's 
about what happens in this moment 
which propels you into the next moment. 
Our job is to make it pre~ent in Ihat 
moment." 

The New Play Fe~tival is a colbhora-
tive effort, according to "A I bmlful of 
Earth's" Alex Smith. For hlln. it offers the 
unique chance to work directly widl :1 
playwright. Many loved this OpportUllIt)· 
because other plays deal only with ~CflptS 
written by playwright.~ not present, or 
even dead. 

THE STAGE MANAGER 
Keeping open lines of communication 

is among most stage manager's dlief 
tasks. As stage manager for dle New Play 
Showcase, Doug Wong says the 1110 t dif-
ficult task is getting everyone together. 
especially on a new play with so nluny 
revisions. "Stage managers help actors 
\vith lines. If dley miss a line we let them 
know later," he said. 

He often comes in 30 minutes before THE PlAYWRIGHT 
"Pan: of being a good playwright is 

having a lot of control and learning how 
to let go of control," said Ken Weitzman, 
a playwright. 

Weitzman says the process of writing 

"I give ideas and they try thcm, but [ 
can't think of myself like, 'everybody 
depends on me,' because then I'd panic 
and get real stressed out. So this is just my 
job but it's what I love to do," 
McDonough said. 

McDonough says the only drawback 
of producing for the New Festival is not 
having enough time. The tough part is 
making choices during preparation and 
rehearsals. 

rehearsals ami ~tays 30 minutes after 
everyone has left. Setting up and taking 
down the set are one of his many respon-
sibilities. 

Conummicating with the different 
began early for the playwrights involved 
in the New Play Festival. For the festival , 
each writer was approached to begin 
thinking about a new script sometime last 
summer. 

Some, such as Weitzman, take endless 
nights of eating at McDonald's and incor-
porate them into a play's larger theme of 
American consumption and fast-food 
culrure. Others, such as Laura Henry, 
find revelations from unexpected places. 

THE ACTORS 
Preparation for a role depends on 

each actor but some things are constant. 
Everyone still has to remember lines. For 
most, the process is simply a matter of 
repetition , something most actors have 
gotten very good at. 

Another aspect is finding the essence 
of the character. For everyone, the 

parties involved, such as set design, 
sound, and costumes is another one. 
Wong explains his job simply:" I\y job is 
to make everyone happy." 

THE SET DESIGNER 
Crucial to the production is the set 

the actors \vill perform on. After illitial

8 HIATUS THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY, APRIL 25, 2002 

The circus arrives with high-flying flair and style Jack Johnson 
set to show 
UCSD how to 
kick back 

Cirque du Soleil's fun produdion of 'Dralion' brin'gs Chinese acrobatics to Del Mar 
By CHARLIE TRAN 
Hiatus Editor 

When onc thlllks of the clr-CllS, what u ually comes to mind are large beasts, lio n 
tamcrs Jnd J cnth -dcfying acro-
batks. From elephants and tigers 
roaming about to thc sound of a 
rnJn bcing shot out of a cannon, 
hJl'ing a night under the "big 
LOp" bring. back many childhood 
memories. 

Just don't tell that to the cast 
and crew of Cirque du Soleil's 
prod uction of "Oralion." 

"Oralion" is not a ci rcus in the 
traditional se nse . With a cast 
consis ting of only humans, this 
production showcases jaw-drop-
ping, awe-inspiring acrobatics 
with all the glitz and glamour of a 
Vegas extravaganza . 

\".'ha t makes any Cirque du 
Soleil show unique is the level 
and depth of the performances. 
From the trapeze to skipping 
ropcs to juggling, elemcnts of any 
standard ci rcus, "Oralion" brings 
out the extremes in perplexity of 
every movement. 

Think juggling six balls at one 
time is difficult? Try doing that on 
one foot while the Oth~r foot is 
kicking another bal! on the ground 
up onto your head. Imagine skip-
ping rope while jumping over !WO 
other sets of rope jumpers at the 
same time. 

Other acts include balancing 
bamboo poles, a double trapeze, 
hoop diving, handbalancing and 
the use of a teeterboard. 

At times, members of the cast 
show how flexible they can be. 
For handbalancing, the per-

former seems more rubber than 
human . 

While balancing herself on 
one hand, the performer is able 
to stretch her entire body back-
ward and manages to bring her 
fcet over her head. She tops that 
feat by switching her balancing 
hand whilc tuckcd in her binding 
position . 

It's a difficult accom plishment 
for the cast of "Oral ion," but they 
succced at not only astonishing 
the audience, but also making it 
look easy enough for anyone to 
attempt. 

Beyond the actual perfor-
mances, Cirque du Solei I is 
renowned for incorporating a 
theme into its production that at 
times seems to be over-the-top 
and somewhat cheesy. 

For "Oralion," the show tries 
to bring everything together with 
a story about the natural ele-
ments: air, water, fire and earth. 
From the flashy costumes to the 
intricate sets, "Oralion" some-
times feels like being in a Baz 
Luhrl11ann film rather than a cir-
cus. 

No circus is complete without 
clowns, and "Oral ion " is no excep-
tion. However, these clowns are an 
integral part of the entire perfor-
mance, providing not only comic 
relief, bur also integrating the 
theme of the show. The clowns 
bring wit and charming humor 
beyond their typical, slapstick 
stereotypes. 

[n addi tion, these clowns are 
willing to thoroughly humiliate 
and tease audience members, 
making it a delight for everyone 
except for the one being made fun 

of. 
There are many different 

Cirque du Soleil productions 
around, but "Oralion" is unique 
because of its emphasis on 
Chinese acrobatics. With a cast 
that is predominantly Chinese, 
"Oralion" combines many of the 
acts from Chinese circuses and 
ties it in with Western choreogra-
phy and flair.

Staff Writer 

San Oiego will mellow the wildest spirit with its laid -back beach atmosphere. But even 
this idyllic haven can learn a thing 
or two about relaxing from the 
master of chill himself, J ack 
Johnson, who will be performing at 
RIMAC Arena on Friday. 

Known for his lethargic blues 
sounds, catchy acoustic guitar 
strums, deeply lulling bears, and 
mournful voice, Johnson is, simply 
enough, chill. His style of music 
reflects of his life. 

Johnson grew up in Hawaii, the 
epicenter of all lethargy. Son of 
Hawaiian surfing champion Jeff 
Johnson, Jack became a professional 
surfer at age 16. He surfed profes-
sionally until a surfi ng collision with 
some dangerous reefs left him badly 
injured and led him down a different 
path. His passion for surfing was 
funneled into directing surf films, in 
which he had great potential. 

Johnson attended UC Santa 
Barbara, where his musical talent 
began to surface. The band G. 
Love & Special Sauce took notice 
of his talent and asked him to 
appear on their album. Johnson'S 
talent quickly garnered contract 
solicitations, all of which he turned 
down . because he simply had no 
musical ambition . He eventually 
signed with Enjoy Records, a small

THURSDAY, APRIL 25, 2002 THE UCSD GUAROIAN HIATUS 9 

Theater: 
Different cast and crew members 
make up UCSD's theatrical production 
Continued from page 7 

mcetings betwcen design team, the director, 
and playwright, the scenic designer starts with 
rOllgh sketches, which eventually transform 
into fully functional sets. 

"Arrangements" and "A Handful of Earth" 
were logistical challenges because both lIsed 
the same set, according to Ryan Palmcr, scenic 
designer for both plays. 

Palmcr usually starts with rough sketches 
after reading the script and consulting with the 
playwright and direcror. Afrerward, models lire 
made, and from them, fully functional sets are 
built. For "Arrangements," Palmer wanted to 
to visualize its dark and light themes of ugli -
ness and beauty with a two-part set feanlring 
an upstairs and downstairs. Ultimately though, 
his job is to enhance the performances without 
overshadowing them. 

THE LIGHTING DESIGNER 
According to Scott Grabau, lighting 

designer (or "TIlcre's No Bayvillc in Texas," 
his first job is to confer with the director after 
reading the script to gct a feel for the produc-
tion. After that, his objective is to develop 
lighting "brush strokes" that will support a 
play's environment. 

The festival puts great demand on his team 
because it is very difficult logi stically to pro-

duce six shows in such a short time. 
For Grabua, the collaboration is worth it. 

"You don't have to create in a vacuum," he 
says. "The sharing of ideas can often make 
my work greater than it would be if I had to 
conceive it alone." 

THE COSTUME DESICNER 
The unique challenge of "There's No 

Bayville in Texas" was its use of over 200 props, 
including handmade prison unifomls. Because 
of the difficulty of obraining dlc real thing, 
costume designer Jen Anderson created repli-
cas by altering dickies. For Anderson, her job is 
a constant process of sculpting. Unlike build-
ing a set that is finished once it is on stage, cos-
tumes are constandy tweaked until opening 
night. 

Because her job includes hair and make\!p, 
od,cr challenges came up. Making eternally 
"suave" actors such as Heidami look dirty was 
onc of them. "Wc had the hardest time trying 
to mess up his hair wid10ut making him still 
look cool." 

CODA 
Creating five high-quality plays that until 

only a few months ago did not even exist is cer-
tainly no easy feat. TIle many people involved 
prepare for months before any official perfor-
mance. Ultimately, what makes UCSO's New 
Play Festival so grand is how it strives to make 
the act of collaborating its own reward, instead 
of a means to something external. Bravo!

Beulah 
Coast is Never Clear 

Velocette 

****--A few "oohs" and 
"ahhs" never hurt anyone. 
They certainly did no 
harm to Beulah's third 
album, "The Coast is 
Never Clear." 

'What is clear for this 
San Francisco band is that 
their formula for a full -
bodied album sets them 
a part. Beulah's use of 
presynthesizer keyboards 
takes a backseat to the real 
thing. If technology could-
n 't provide the perfect 
sound, the six-piece band 
rented various instruments 
to pioneer the sound' on 
their own. 

A growing fi sh in an 
indie pond, Beulah has to 
be described as "sunshine 
pop ." A Beach 
Boys/Beatles blend , 
Beulah's melodies, har-
monies and unpredictable 

lyrics sound are like a 
song that would accompa-
ny any good road trip up 
the coas!. Beulah shows 
their humor with the 
ironically violent title, "A 
Good Man IS Easy to 
Kill ." 

"When get to 
California, I'm gonna 
write my name in the 
sa nd," voca list Miles 
Kuros!"), si ngs in a head-
bopping Ort of way. 
Beulah trades heavy riffs 
for infectious horns on 
this track, creating a 
punchy sound for a song 
about a relationshi p with a 
man's father as he grows 
older. 

Though "The Coast is 
ever Clear" sounds 

graceful , the recording 
process was strenuous at 
times. 

With the support of big 
label Velocette Records 
for the first time, Beulah 
has come from cassette 
recording sessions in the 
hallways of their apart-
ment buildings to an ear-
catching studio sound that 
delivers on each track. 
"The Coast is Never 
Clear" is truly an album to 
have on repeat. Beulah 
crafts songs that are hard 
to label as any specific 
decade, genre or sound.

B-Side Players 
Movement 

Surfdog 

**** Renowned for their 
revol utionary lyrics and 
political motifs , the B-Side 
Players are starting, in a 
sense, a new movement. 
Along with frontman 
Karlos Paez's concern with 
social injustice, particularly 
in regard to U.S.-Mexico 
relations and Mexico's 
treatment of its indigenous 
population, there is a 
youthfulness to the group 
that creates a new move-
ment of dance and music. 

B-Side Players, a native 
San Diego Latin band, is 
scheduled to release a new 
album titled "Movement." 
After a close encounter 
with death in a van accident 
while the band was touring, 
the B-Side Players have 
become even more interest-
ed in voicing their opinions. 
And what better way to let 

• reviews 
our the desire of the soul 
than with a mixture of sev-
eral types of ethnic music? 

"Movement" comains 
two tradi tional Latin pieces, 
two funk-style pieces, two 
reggae songs, and the rest is 
beyond categorization. 
There is also a very ~pecial 
track, "Spill the Wine," in 
which all seven members of 
the band demonstrate their 
musical talent. By including 
War's semi nal classic "Spill 
the Wine," the band further 
reaffirms their soulful roots. 

The music, while both 
energetic and appealiJlg on 
CD, seems to be better live 
with powerful percussive 
instruments and traditional 
Latin instruments such as 
timbales, shekere and 
cajon. It is the kind of 
music that makes you want 
to get up and dance. 

]n their live perfor-
mances, the band adds sig-
nature riffs borrowed from 
rode bands such as Jane's 
Addiction and Metallica. 

The stage is the place 
where the B-Side Players. 
After seeing the B-Side 
Players live, you most cer-
tainly will want to buy 
"Movement." 

Look to the hiatus cal-
endar on page 11 for infor-
mation on their upcoming 
show.

Vanessa Carlton 
Be Not Nobody 

A&M 

**** Vanessa Carlton's 
catchy piano-pop single, 
"A Thousand Miles," has 
been whored out on pop 
radio stations and the 
video has found its way 
into heavy rotation on 
MTY. Another insipid pop 
star in the making? 

Suprisingly, no. 
Carlton knows her way 

around Mozart and Pink 
Floyd. Her classic rock 
influences find their way 
on to the al bum wi th a 
great rendition of "Paint it 
Black" by The Rolling 
Stones. 

She was schooled in 
dance at the School of 
American Ballet. But her 
experience in the ballet 
world was confining and 
she was exposed to the 
vicious competition and 
pressure. 

THURSDAY. APRIL 25, 2002 

Carl ton found solace in 
music. She had been classi-
cally trained by her mother 
and wrote dozens of songs. 

The result is a well-
rounded album with strong 
piano riffs backed by lush 
strings and some percus-
sion. The tone of her voic!! 
sounds almost child-l ike 
with J ewel-esque infl ec-
tions but the voice is strong 
with a very good range. 

Some may be tempted 
to compare her music to 
Fiona Apple or Tori Amos 
with more pop. But th at is 
too easy. Carlton 's unique 
sound is bolstered by key-
board stylings that are dis-
tinctly classical and the 
orchestration gives her 
sound a traditional quality 
with a modern tone. 

"A Thousand Miles" is 
a great pop song but it's 
getting close to being 
overplayed . "Pretty Baby" 
is a mellow and romantic 
tune. You will find a plcas-
ant chord progression 
reminiscent of The 
Beatles' "Dear Prudence" 
in Carlton's "Rinse." 

If you are in the mood 
for a fresh pop sound that 
won't annoy you after a few 
spins, then Vanessa 
Carlton's debut, "Be Not 
Nobody," will definitely 
surprise you.

Feel the desert heat at 
the Coachella festival 
The epic two-day Indio festival will rival 
music festivals held in Europe 
By IOSEPH LEE 
Hiatus Editor 

Europe has been known for its music festivals, which bring together dozens of bands, 
electronic acts and thousands of 
people. The Coachella Music and 
Arts festival will easily rival those 
epic festivals. Now entering its 
third incarnation, this festival has 
brought together an incredible 
lineup for the two-day event at the 
massive Empire Polo field in 
Indio, Calif. 

The violence of Woodstock 
1999 tarnished the peace and love 
of the first Woodstock, but it is this 
West Coast festival that will bring 
back the magic and glory of huge 
festivals. 

Coachella has something for 
everyone. 

Huge acts such as Bjork and 
Oasis will headline Saturday and 
Sunday. There will also be many 
indie-roclc performances, OJ sets 
and hip-hop acts. 

Oasis is poised to release their 
first single, "Hindu Times," in 
what seems likes ages . "Hindu 
Times" preserves the original sonic 
quality that made Oasis one of the 
greatest bands in the world. The 
single has also been gaining some 
airplay in radio stations across the 
country. Look for their new album, 
"Heathen Chemistry," this sum-
mer. 

The Strokes will tear up the 
stage with their retro-punk sound, 
and Jack Johnson is sure to cool 
down the crowd with his mellow 
acoustic tunes. The Strokes are 
among the bands that will be 
warming up with gigs in San 
Diego. 

G . Love & Special Sauce will 
also look to cool down the crowd 
with their smooth sounds. Pete 
Yorn will be rocking out to a much 
bigger crowd than the one he 
played to at his intimate set at 4th 
& B earlier this month. British 
rockers Elbow, who opened for 
Yorn, will also bring their progres-
sive rock sound to the stage.

The formidable OJ duo Sasha 
& Digweed has spent a good 
amount of time in Southern 
California. After an incredible set 
at 4th & B late last year, they will 
be among the top acts at Coachella 
when they spin trance-techno 
grooves to the masses. [n the city 
of San Diego, they have upgraded 
to the San Diego Sports Arena for 
what will be an amazing set in early 
M ay. 

Riding on the wave of their lat-
est album, "Come With Us," the 
Chemical Brothers will be another 
one of the major electronic acts. 
The ever-present Paul Oaken fold 
has found himself producing the 
"Swordfish" soundtrack and man-
aging the popular Perfecto label. 
Dutch OJ Tiesto is lesser-known to 
the U.S. crowd, but everyone will 
know his name after they see and 
hear him spin. 

Groove Armada will induce 
much ass-shakin' with their OJ 
set, and they also fly in on the 
wings of their popular album, 
"Goodbye Country (Hello 
Nightclub)." Deep house act 
Miguel Migs will look to steam up 
eyeglasses with his sexy records. 
BT will be also be performing a 
rare OJ set. 

T-Up-hop acts such as Jurassic 5, 
KRS-One , Dilated Peoples and 
Mos Def will round out the festi -
val. 

With a lineup like thi s, the cost 
of the ticket will be worth it. But 
remember to bring the sunscreen, 
the hats and the sunglasses. 
Temperatures will be well into the 
low 90s. And bring cash, because 
everything is going to cost an arm 
and a leg once you're inside. 

The Indio heat will be nothing 
compared to the heat that these 
bands will generate. This is a festi-
val you will be talking about for 
ages; it is a festival you can't miss.

WHY RENT? BUY! 
"As a 3rd year student at UCSD I wanted to live off campus and have a 
place that I could go home to and feel comfortable in. I gave Tobin a call 
after I saw his ad in the GUARDIAN and because I was familiar with him 
after living in the dorms. He not only helped me and my parents find a 
great place, he also cares about you, which is evident when he calls 
periodically to see how I am doing. He has been a tremendous help and I 
hope when I'm ready to buy property later in life I will have a real estate 
agent who has been as wonderful as Tobin! Calling Tobin is a no-bra iner 
if you are looking for a place to live."

Crew exacts its revenge against USD 
Tritons prepare for the Western Championships 
By OWEN MAIN 
Staff Writer 

UCSD men 's crew went to the 
Newport Invitational in the 

orrh Lido channel of Newport 
Beach, Calif., last weekend . The 
TrilOns didn 't bring any boats of 
four, but the three boats of eight 
that made the trip north were all 
smiles. 

In the varsity race, the Tritons 
finished second to Orange Coast 
College, which won by seven sec-
onds. 

"Orange Coast has a lot of 
speed," said UCSD coach Michael 
Filippone. "They've shown that 
they're the best team in our 
league." 

However, in its second-place 
finish, UCSD found redemption 
by beating crosstown rival US D, 
which had previously upset the 
Tritons in rhe San Diego City 
Championships only one week 
before.

UCSD's tenacity carried it 
through the entire game, eYi-
denced by Tiki Hayes, who 
scored while playing on a brolcen 
foot. UCSD was also led by 
Kirstin King, who contributed 
multil:tmalty kicks, including 
one the mid-line to ensur-e 
the UCSD ·wjn; 

Yet UCSD was stopped cold 
by its neIt opponent, Air Force, 
which pinned . t 31-3 lo~ on 
UCSD behind the strength of its 
superior conditiOJling. 

Despite the loss, UCSD\ out-
look remained positiye for II ream 
that had never played in Florida 
or against tfie other teams in the 
tournament. 

"Pretty much everyone had a

"We had a very consistent 
piece," said junior coxswain 
Catherine Stringer. "Beating USD 
by four seconds was definitely a 
confidence booster." 

The Tritons had problems at 
the beginning of the race when a 
sailboat split their boat off from the 
rest of the race. But the team 
regained its rhythm and composure 
and recovered for the second-place 
finish. 

"Even though we came in sec-
ond, this was the best race we've 
had all season," Stringer said. 

[n the first novice division, the 
UCSD men held off Orange Coast 
College and UC Irvine to win by 
three seconds. T he victory 
avenged a loss earlier in the season 
to OCe. 

"They'll be the [Op-ranked 
novice boat going into the West 
Coast Championships," Filippone 
said. 

To round out the field, the 
newly assembled second novice

Tritons rallied but fell a point 
short. Tadlock, Hung and 
Westerman all picked up straight-
set victories, while at the same 
time Dao and O'Neil dropped 
stra ight-set matches to give the 
Aggies the victory. Jansen eventu-
ally won in the No. 5 match to 
give the Tri tons their fourth

proved too big an obstacle to

Continued from page 16 By COURTNEY FIELD 

Staff Writer 

UCSD and Cal State Stanislaus 
finished a four-game weekend series 
Sunday at Warrior Field in Turlock, 
Calif. The Tritons took three of 
four from the Warriors and won the 
fourth game 11-4. 

Warrior pitcher Andrew 
Barrett pitched seven hitless 
innings. But in the top of the 
eighth inning, just after Triton 
shortstop Keith Hernandez 
reached o n an error by Warrior 
shortstop Kyle Dennis, UCSD 
exploded offensively, scoring 10 
runs off seve n hits. The Tritons 
se nt 14 batters to the plate in 
the inning, and UCSD left field-
er John Bologna and first base-
man Chad Addison each 
smacked two singles and drove 
in two runs apiece in the inning. 
Third baseman Keith Albrecht 
also had a single, an RBI and 
scored a run . 

"Guys likc John Bologna and 
Keith Albrecht really stepped up 
and played outstanding baseball," 
said designated hitter Jeff Riddle. 
"They got the ball rolling for the 
tcam and things took off from 
there."

Tuesday'S round in second place, 
trailing Bakersfield by six strokes 
and leading Davis by three. The 
Warriors shot a 2-over-par 290 in 
the final round, and Stanislaus 
ended in third place, two strokes 
behi nd the leaders. 

Seven strokes behind Stanislaus 
and 12 ahead ofthe Tritons, Chico 
State finished with a combined 
score of 877 to walk away with 
fourth place in the CCAA 
Championships. 

The battle for the individual 
championship also needed extra 
holes to determine the tourna-
ment winner. In his final round, 

Bologna and Albrecht helped 
the Tritons batter the Warrior 
bullpen for five runs in less than an 
inning. 

Warrior reliever Justin 
Hoppes gave up three runs on no 
hilS, and the second Warrior 
reliever, Scott Taylor, gave up two 
more runs in just one-thi rd of the 
inning. 

For Cal State Stanislaus, right 
fielder Sean Findley went 2 - for-4, 
including two doubles and three 
RBIs, while center fielder James 
Savala also notched twO doubles 
and an RBI. 

Triton pitcher Alex Cremidan, 
who improved to 7-2 with the win, 
allowed three runs on five hits in 
seven innings. 

Bologna, Addison and 
Hernandez finished with two hits 
and two RBIs each. 

UCSD improves to 26-20- 1 
overall and 2 1-15 in the 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association with the victory, and 
remains in fourth place in the 
conference. The top four teams 
will advance to the postseason, 
and the Tritons plan to be one of 
those teams.

Jason Boyd of UC Davis posted a 
7-under-par 65 , placing him in a 
tie with teammate Jay 
Westerlund and Bakersfield's 
Dan Warburton, each with scores 
of 2 13. After Warburton was 
eliminated on the first playoff 
hole, Boyd defeated Westerlund 
on the second hole. 

Stanislaus' Charlie Zinn played

the leaders for fourth place.

by going about things the way we 
have been, good things will hap-

The Tritons wiIl have to finish 
up the season on the road as they 
play their last regular season series 
against UC Davis this weekend. 

But it's not the Urivalry" that 
UCSD will encounter - it's the 
game itself. 

uSomething that the coaching 
staff emphasizes is that we need to 
approach the other team as if 
they're faceless," Riddle said. "So 
if it's the Yankees, a little league 
team or Davis, we will come out 
with the same attirude: ready to 
compete."

ma tes, and Scheer tied for 30th. 
The Tritons' fifth golfer, junior 
Andy Thomson, ended in 36th 
place. 

UCSD entered th e tourna-
ment wanting to ensure a victory 
over Cal State San Bernardino in 
the CCAA Championships, thus 
strengthening the Tritons' 
chances of being invited to the 
NCAA Division II Regional 
tournament, which will take 
place from May 5 to May 9. 
UCSD finished six strokes ahead 
of San Bernardino, and the 
Tritons now have to hope they 
are selected by the NCAA com-
mittee.

much stiffer opposition from 18th-
ranked Grand Canyon. Earlier in 
the season, UCSD stole a 5-4 deci-
sion over the Antelopes and did it 
again Sarurday afternoofJ . T he day 
started ominously with the Tritons 
dropping two of the three dOllbles 
matches. 

Dao and Jansen were the lone 
victors with an 8-3 walk in the No. 
3 competition. Tad lock and 
\OVcsterman labored to a 4- dereat, 
and O'Neil and Hung lost a nail-
biter 6-8. 

Singles saved the day for 
UCSD. In the ea rli er meeting 
between the two teams, rhe 
Tritons lost the top three single, 
and won the bottom three. 
However, this time it would be the 
top three that would win the 
clUlch matches.

Westerman each cruised to 6-1, 6-1

the last two matches, No. I Dao 
and No. 3 Tadlock stepped up 
their games. Dao came into the 
match with a 7- 12 record com-
pared to her opponen t's 13-9 
record . It was Dao who took the 
initiative in the match, taking the 
first set 6-4, then taking the sec-
ond set 6- 1 to even th e tealll 
score. 

All eyes then focllsed on the l '0. 
3 match between Tadlock and 
Christine LiWanPo. Tadlock lost 
to LiWanPo earlier in the year 3-6, 
0-6, but this match ended in a dif-
ferent manner. Tadlock took the 
first set 6-1 before dro pping a 
break in the second 4-6. The rhird 
set ended wi th a 7 -5 ti ebreakcr to 
give the third set to Tadlock 7 -6. 

Attempting to ride the 
momentum gained from such an 
important win , the Tritons headed 
into the champi o nship game 
against UC Davis to avenge last 
year's loss. T he two teams met 
earlier this season, with UCSD 
edging out the Aggies with a 5-2 
victory.

The Trirons participated in the

UCSD honors student-athletes 
Eleven Triton athletes honored by UCSD athlet-
ics department for excellence on and off the field 
By BRYCE WARWICK 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD athletics depart-
ment honored several of its out-
standing academics at a luncheon 
Tuesday to celebrate National 
Student-Athlete Day. 

Everett Schroeter, Megan 
Mendoza, Andrew Anfora, Samara 
Silverman, Steve Martin, Elizabeth 
Hughes, Vladimir Djapic, Kris 
Chiles, Lyndsey Tadlock, Yukio 
King and Laura Santerre each 
received recognition. These II stu-
dent-athletes represent five col-
leges, I I teams and nine majors. 

The National Consortium for 
Academics and Sports, tile Center 
for the Study of Sport in Society and 
the ational Collegiate Athletic 
Association also supported the event. 

"The overall student-athlete at 
UCSD is much more involved in a 
lot of varied activities," said Assistant 
Athletic Director Wendy Taylor 
May, who organized the luncheon. 

Athletics Director Earl Edwards 
agreed in his statements concern-
ing the nature of the festivities. 

"The day is designed to honor 
student-athletes who have achieved 
excellence in academics and atlliet-
ics, while having many significant 
contributions to the community 
alld the school as a whole," he said. 

Edwards' assertion was backed by 
the impressive list of community ser-

vice activities performed by the 
award recipients, who have volun-
teered at food banks, helped build 
homes, mentored, tutored, and 
worked witll other charity programs. 

While the assembled dignitaries 
- which included Vice Chancellor 
of Student Affairs Joseph Watson, 
college deans, college staff and ath-
letics administration - were 
impressed with the student-ath-
letes, the athletes were quick to 
praise the cooperation of many dif-
ferent groups that made their suc-
cess possible. 

"I thought the important part 
was the fact that there were faculty 
here with the coaches," said junior 
soccer player Chiles - a molecular 
biology major with a 3.84 grade 
point average. 

Senior volleyball player 
Santerre, a psychology major with a 
3.90 GPA, agreed that UCSD's ath-
letics program is something special 
because of the way unity is devel-
oped through participation 

"It really is an athletic commu-
nity here," she said. "The people 
who come and play here at UCSD 
come because they love the sport 
that they're playing and they love 
competing and working with a 
group of people toward challenging 
goals. I think that's something tllat 
the athletes take to the other parts 
of their lives." 

Already having graduated and 

gone to work, Djapic definitely 
takes his Triton athletic experience 
- and his doctorate degree in elec-
trical engineering - toward chal-
lenging goals in work. He now 
works for the Space and aval 
Warfare Systems Center of San 
Diego as a design engineer. 

Student-athletes such as Djapic 
refute the stereotype of athletes not 
being able to carry their weight 
academically. 

"The old prejudice about ath-
letes not being so good at acade-
mics is not necessari ly true," said 
senior bioengineering major 
Schroeter, who represented the 
men's tennis team. 

Those present seemed proud of 
their accomplishments, but also 
looked forward to even more 
growth and development of high-
quality snldent-athlete:;. 

" I think it 's especially important 
now that the [student initiated ath-
letic fee referendum] passed. The 
administration has to work with 
student-a thl etes and the athleoc 
department a lot more ," said 
Mendoza , a ophomore biologica l 
anthropology ma jor from the 
women's soccer team. "It's going to 
be good." 

In closing, Edwards invoked a 
sloga n of the UC D athletics 
department as a model for the pro-
gram: "A proud history of academ-
ic and ath letic excell ence." 

Women's tennis takes second place 
Tritons knocked off by DC D avis in finals 
By COREY HOLMAN 
Staff Writer 

After losing to UC Davis in the 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Associa tion women's tennis tour-
nament last yea r, UCSD hoped to 
gain redemption Sunday when it 
faced the Aggies in the finals of 
this year's tournament. However, 
there was only deja vu as UC 
Davis beat UCSD agai n. 

The ninth-ranked Tritons beat 
Cal State L.A. and host Grand 
Canyon University to reach the 
finals Friday and Sanlrday, respec-
tively. 

UCSD opened with a solid 7-
2 win over the Golden Eagles of 
Cal State Los Angeles, the 
CCAA's eighth-place team. 
Triton coach Liz LaPlante took 
this opportunity to rest some 
normal starters in the singles 
matches. 

The Tritons won two of the 
three doubles matches, with 
Ashley O 'Neil and Mary Hung 
winning 8- 1 and Jasmin Dao and 
Kristina Jansen sweeping 8-0. In 
No. \ doubles, Tadlock and 
"Vesterman lost in an 8-6 squeak-
er to Tamara Encina and Kathrina 
Menzel. 

In singl es, Lyndsey Tadlock 
moved to the No. I singles posi-
tion, giving regular No. 1 Dao a 
rest. H owever, Tadlock couldn't 
stop CAA top-ranked player 
Tamara Enci na and lost 1-6, \ -6. 
Encina's two victories would be 
the Golden Eagles' only points of 
the encounter. LaPlante rested her 

normal o. 2 Ashley O'Neil as 
well, placing Mary Hung in that 
spot. Hung struggled but evennl-
ally put her opponent away in a 
third-set tiebreak 6-4, 5-7, 7-6 
( 10-6). From No.3 to No.6, the 
story W.IS entirely one-sided. 

J ansen, Westerman, Sarah 13ahlert 
and Stephanie Moriarty each won, 
dropping a combined six games in 
eight total sets.
