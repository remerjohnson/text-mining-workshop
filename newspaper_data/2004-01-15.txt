Associate News Editor would be raised 10 percent for 

Gov. Arnold Schwazenegger's 
proposal to solve the state's budget 
crisis could increase student fees 
and lower financial aid at the 
University of California. The gov-
ernor's plan is raising concerns 
among undergraduates, non-resi-
dents and graduate students alike. 

If the proposal is approved by 

undergraduates, 40 percent for 
graduate students and and addi-
tional 20 percent for non-residents. 
Financial aid available from new 
student fee revenue would also be 
reduced from 33 percent to 20 per-
cent, while Cal Grant eligibility 
would simultaneously be reduced.

Spending on faculty 
could be pared down 
Gov. proposes to increase 
UC student-faculty ratio 

By MAlGRET GONZALES 
Staff Writer 

State spending on faculty may 
be cut by 5 percent if Gov: Arnold 
Schwarzenegger's budget proposals 
for the fiscal year are .approved by 
the state legislature. The gover-
nor's administration intends to 
increase the student-faculty ratio to 
20.7 -to-l from the current 19.7 -to-
1. This potential cut has raised 
concerns for faculty recruitment 
and retention, with faculty com-
pensation at UCSD already lagging 

behind that of other public univer-
sities in the nation. 

However, the effects of such a 
cut are undetermined as of yet, and 
the proposal itself is subject to 
change. 

"What comes out of the legisla: 
ture months from now could be 
very different from what the gov-
ernor has proposed," said 
Margaret F. Pryatel, assistant vice 
chancellor of resource manage-
ment. "Whatever the outcome of

junior Michelle Lee said. "I 
understand that there's a need for 
money because of the deficit, but I 
think that there are other things 
that could be done instead of mak-
ing increases in education fees." 

According to the proposal, 
undergraduate tuition would 
increase by $498. Meanwhile, non-
resident undergraduates would 
have to pay $2,746 more and non-
resident graduate students would 
have to pay $2,449 more. Both 
increases would · be in addition to 
campus-based miscellaneous fees. 

For Thurgood Marshall 
College freshman Jean Heff, who 
is currendy paying about 533,000 
in out-of-state student tuition and 
fees, the increase could mean 
more difficultie!. 

"I'm very disappointed, espe-
cially because the governor proba-
bly could have taken money from 
other things instead of the school 
system," Heff said. "I think that if 
the increase was a few percent less, 
it would help a lot." 

Graduate students face an 
increase which would raise tuition 
as much as 52,088 from the current 
yearly tuition of 55,219. Graduate

The planned method of next 
quarter's A.S. elections is in jeop-
ardy, according to reports that 
instant runoff voting may not be 
implemented in time on 
StudentLink because of other pro-
gramming projects. 

Instant runoff voting, a method 
that allows voters to rank candi-
dates in order of preference, was 
added to the A.S. Election Bylaws 
in March 2003, and is scheduled to 
take effect in this year's elections. 

Mae W Brown, assistant vice 
chancellor of admissions and 
enrollment services and chair of the 
StudentLink Advisory Committee, 
said that other projects have 
exhausted the programming 
resources that would be needed to 
implement the instant runoff vot-
ing on StudentLink this year. 

StudentLink has run online AS. 
elections in the past. 

"Given all of the projects that 
were already listed before this par-
ticular project, it was viewed ... that 
there was just no way, given limited 
resources, that this could be even

fewer undergraduates

Cuttinl down: If Gov. Amold Schwarzenegger's budget proposal is passed, 
the University of califomia may enroll 10 percent less new students. 

By BRYAN TSAO 
Associate News Editor 

As part of a $372 million 
budget reduction proposal, Gov. 
Arnold Schwarzenegger plans to 
reduce enrollment to the 
University of California by 10 
percent, which some fear could 
put the university's Master Plan 
for Higher Education at risk. 

The Master Plan, which 
calls for the University of 
California to admit the top 12.5 
percent of each graduating high 

school class, has been adhered 
to since the university's estab-
lishment in 1960. The 
University of California esti-
mates that under normal cir-
cumstances, enrollment would 
grow by approximately 5,000 
students for the 2004-05 acade-
mic year, while the governor's 
plan would reduce enrollment 

·by 3,200 from current enroll-
ment levels. 

"We have always done our

ranked at that point," Brown said. 
According to Brown, other pro-

jects such as the Career Services 
student portfolio, online statement 
of legal residency and the new 
comprehensive MyUCSD Web 
portal are already straining pro-
gramming resources. 

The A.S. Council discussed the 
instant runoff voting implementa-
tion problems at its Jan. 7 meeting. 

"The A.S. should follow what 
its rules are. The rule oflaw, per se, 
with A.S. is that the elections will 
use the instant runoff voting sys-
tem," AS. President Jeremy Paul 
Gallagher said. 

A.S. Elections Manager Tom 
Chapman said that if StudentLink 
cannot implement instant runoff 
voting in time for elections, the 
council will have to choose between 
four alternatives: work with 
StudentLink to collect the votes but 
not tabulate them, hire an outside 
company to run the entire election 
independendy of StudentLink, con-
duct the election using paper bal-
lots, or change the election bylaws 
back to a simple plurality system.

UCSD students now have an 
opportunity for an internship at 
Preuss School that may be accepted 
for academic credit. Preuss School 
is a public middle and high school 
for low-income students located on 
East Campus. 

The program is part of the 
Academic Internship Program, 
which is available to students with 
junior standing or higher. 
Previously, the only way to receive 
credit for volunteering at Preuss 
was through the Teacher 
Education Program. 

"The idea is that UCSD stu-
dents are teamed with a teacher, 
administrator or counselor, and 
they will help in various ways like

research topics, creating plans for improving 
vocabulary, aiding advisors for student activ-
ities and meeting with the students to set 
goa ls," Preuss Dean of Students Scott 
Barton said. 

At Thurgood Marshall College, involve-
ment in the program can meet a general 
education requirement or be the equivalent 
of three breadth requirements. Sixth 
College has also agreed that the course may 
satisfy three breadth requirements. John 
Muir College is considering to weigh the 
program as 12 units. 

"From the institutional aspect, it's in 
Thurgood Marshall College'S interest to see 
that students have the ability to pursue both 
academic excellence and social responsibili-
ty in the context of the general education 
program," Marshall Provost Cecil Lytle 
said. 

Since the program started the first week 
of winter quarter, not many of the 'first class 
of interns have been assigned to work yet. 
But students enrolled in the Teacher 
Education Program have been tutoring 
Preuss students since 2000, one year after 
the school's opening. 

Jen White, a Marshall junior, participates 
in the TEP program. Last quarter, she met 
Preuss student Thomas Mowery, and he 
asked her to tutor him again this year. 

U All the kids want to be here, and they 
want to learn," White said. 

To attend Preuss School, a student must 
come from a family of at least four making 
less than $19,000 annually. 

According to the school Web site, 
roughly 90 percent of Preuss students come 
from neighborhoods south of Interstate 8, 
making their daily trip to school lengthy . . 
Some students travel from as far as San 
Ysidro. ' 

They must take a trolley and. then trans-
fer onto a bus for an approximate two-hour 
ride to get to school. 

In addition, the school hours at Preuss 
are extended, running from 8:45 a.m. to 
4:05 p.m. Students who choose to Stay for 

tutoring remain at school until 5:) 5 p.m. 
These hours are not typical of other public 
schools in the San Diego area. 

"[Preuss students) all come from under-
privileged backgrounds," Marshall College 
Provost Intern Anjanette Urdanivia said. 
"They can't ask their parents to help them 
[with homework) . UCSD students have a lot 
to offer ... you have this great thing, why not 
share it?" 

The first class of Preuss students will be 
graduating in June. Many of them have 
already been accepted on early admissions 
by colleges such as New York University 
and the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology. 

David laea, who was accepted to NYU, 
chose to attend Preuss because it was the 
first of its kind. Jesse Lopez, who was 
accepted to MIT, wanted to take advantage 
of the college preparatoty curriculum. Both 
said there is an advantage being situated on 
a college campus. 

"Personally, I've gotten a lot of support, " 
said Iaea, who was a research assistant for 
UCSD biology professor James Nieh in 
behavioral biology studies. 

Lopez, who is currently taking advanced 
math classes at UCSD, said that "the UCSD 
campus and the Preuss School are one." 

Monica Gomez, the mother of twO sons 
at Preuss, shares the same regard for the 
involvement of UCSD students and faculty 
at Preuss. 

"I think [the tutoring program] is a beau-
tiful project," Gomez said. "When my kids 
know the expectations set for them, they try 
to reach them. I t's very important for the 
kids to watch the life of college students 
because they want to go to college them-
selves." 

UCSD students who wish to volunteer at 
Preuss but aren't eligible for the Academic 
Internship Program may contact Barton at 
rbarton@ucrd.edu. 

""Ve really appreciate the tutors," Barton 
said. "They get something out of it that you 
can't buy. It has its own rewards that you 
can't describe."

Fees: Students on the margin of 
eligibility could lose CalGrant 

continued from page I 
External Heather Flowe said that the fee hike 
could translate into decreases in capital invest-
ments in the California economy. 

"In reality, increases in graduate student 
fees mean that departments will enroll fewer 
graduate students," Flowe said. "In many 
departments on campus, there is little fund-
ing to go around to support graduate Stu-
dent ruition. Increasing student fees, I'm 
afraid, might discourage students." 

Financial aid would also be cut from stu-
dent fee revenue collected from student fee 
hikes and set aside specifically for financial 
aid. 

"We've used it to help fund low-income 
students," Director of Financial Aid Vince 
de Anda said. "We'll have to look at a lot of 
analysis, but it is simple math. The pie is 
going to have to be sliced thinner and that 
means that there would be less grant funds

in student packages." 
According to UC spokesperson Hanan 

Eisenman, the cut could mean rescinding a 
part of the University Student Aid program 
that had previously assisted students who 
were not eligible for any other grants to cover 
half of last year's fee increases, The part that 
would be rescinded gave aid to approximate-
ly 6,500 students who came from middle-
income families making $90,000 or less. 

"The cut to financial aid is onc of the most 
distressing parts of the proposal because there 
would be difficulty in maintaining access for 
low-income students," Eisenman said. 

The proposal also does not allow for the 
Cal Grant to cover the fee increases. 
Requirements for the grant that would make 
some students eligible are expected to change. 

"The income threshold is going to go 
down, which means that some middle-income 
families, mostly families in the margi n who 
were eligi ble for Cal Grant last year, are not 
going to be eligible this year," De Anda said. 

The UC Board of Regents is expected to 
set student fees for Fall 2004 later in the 
winter or spring quarter. 

"A lot of families are probably concerned 
about the proposal," Eisenman said. "The 
key question is how the fees and financial aid 
can work together in a way that would let 
low-income students still have access to the 
university. " 

Students seeking financial aid for the fall 
quarter must complete applications by 
March. According to De Anda, because the 
university does not know what the outcome 
of the proposal will be, the office of financial 
aid services and the university must con tin-
lie to analyze the impact of increases and 
make the best possible guess in order to set 
aid packages by February or March. 

"This should in no way discourage stu-
dents from applying, and they should sti ll 
make those deadlines," De Anda said. "We'll 
come up with the best package that we pos-
sibly can, using all our resources, and we'll 
try to use our lobbying power as much a we 
can. It's a reality that there's a budget prob-
lem and something has to give."

J3udget proposal bears 
bad news for ues 

GOV. Arnold Schwarzene er unveiled his 208,f-05 
budget proposal Jan. 9, 
including $372 million in 
cuts to the University of 
California and a 10-percent 
in-state undergraduate stu-
dent fee increase to help 
close a $14 billion deficit. 

If approved by the UC 
Board of Regents, the 
increase would contribute 
to a total hike of more than 
$2,500 in 18 months for 
resident undergraduates. 
This, when coupled with 
other cost-saving road-
blocks that have maintained 
the university's affordabili-
ty, will undoubtedly deteri-
orate the latter part of the 
UC sr,stem's "quality and 
access' tagline. 

The fUnneling of one-
third of the total fee hike 
revenue to financial aid will 
decrease to only 20 percent, 
effectively stripping the one-
time guarantee that students 
from low-income house-

holds could receive Cal 
Grants that cover the entire 
increase. Access to the 
University of CaHfornia is 
further damaged by 
Schwarzenegger's proIX>sed 
elimination of all state-fund-
ed outreach programs and 
his suggested plan to reduce 
enrollirient by backing out 
of the California Master 
Plan for Higher Educations 
promise to admit the top 
12.5 percent of graduating 
high school classes. 

State Senate President 
Pro Tempore John Burton 
(0 - San Francisco) has 
proposed a solution that 
would restore between $2 
billion to $3 billion by draw-
ing revenue from a tempo-
rary upper-income tax 
increase. The proposal is 
similar to temporary tax 
hikes imposed by Governors 
Ronald Reagan and Pete 
Wilson. Caltfornia should 
not waver in its Master Plan 
promise to keep higher edu-
cation accessible. 

Runoff elections_ would 
validate A •. S~ agenda 

Last winter, A.S. Council formed the Ad Hoc Task Force on 
Voting Systems to explore 
and propose a plan to 
improve UCSO's electoral 
process, which was a 
straightforward vote on 
StudentLink. The task force 
met diligently and specifical-
ly to address instant runoff 
elections, a system that sup-
porters claim ensures a true 
majority rule 

In instant runoff elec-
tions at UCSO, students 
would rank all candidates 
in order of preference. If 
one candidate received 
majority, that candidate 
automa',ically wins. If no 
one captures the majori!}'. 
the lowest-ranked candl-
date would be eliminated 
and the votes of those who 
voted for that candidate 
count for their next-ranked 
candidate. The process is 
repeated until one candi-
date earns over 50 percent 
of the popular vote. 

There are several paths 
to take for instant runoff 
elections, and changing 
StudentLink to accommo-
date this method is the 
most sensible choice. 

An online instant runoff 
system is not only more 
convenient but less costly 
than the paper ballots 
method, in which printing 
and labor costs start to pile 
up. What seems like a con-
fusing process and complex 
change is simple alteration 
on StudentLink's Web site. 
A.S can either buy such 
source code or enlist the 
help of a computer science 
major on campus. 

Since A.S. took the pro-
gressive step of fonning the 
task force, discussions bave 
not yielded much action. 
With elections just down the 
road and time ticking down 
to take actionl A.S. needs to 
step up and aggressively 
work with StudentLink to 
make instant runoff elec-
tions a top priority.

Animals not without 

legal protection 
Editor: 

In your Jan. 8 article about 
treatment of laboratory animals 
at the Salk Institute, you said, 
"While the federal Animal 
Welfare Act would protect pri-
mates from the treatment 
alleged by the source, there are 
currently no laws that protect 
rodents." 

I don't understand what you 
meant by the statement, "there 
are currently no laws that protect 
rodents." I do not do animal 
research, but anyone who has 
ever taken a course in scientific 
"thics (as virtually everyone who 
does any kind of research involv-
ing human or animal subjects 
must, at some point, under 
National Institute of Health reg-
ulations), there are plenty of laws 
protecting all venebrate labora-
tory animals. 

Some of the principles govern-
ing animal research can be found at

mnces/phspoJ.hrm. Information spe-
cific to rodents can be found at

I believe strongly that allega-
tions of mistreatment of laborato-
ry animals must be investigated 
and I commend you for the arti -
cle; with the exception of the 
error above, I felt it was well writ-

Con5elVatives too are 
subjects of stereotypes 
Editor: 

I'm writing in response to the 
Thursday, Jan. 8 article by 

Marianne Madden on homosexu-
al marriages. Frankly, I found it 
amazingly misguided. 
Throughout the course of the 
article, Madden re;tched far back 
into her bag of insults and 
referred to the conservative right 
wing as homophobic, ignorant 
and narrow-minded: a group of 
bigots who hold onto an outdated 
belief, that of fundamentalist 
Christianity, and blind themselves 
to the fact that marriage: has no 
sancti ty. I'd like to 0 ffer up a few 
reasons explaining why Madden is 
wrong. 

As one of those fundamentalist 
Christians that she is obviously so 
knowledgeable about, I'll start by 
saying that I think homosexuality 
is wrong. However, my reason is 
not ignorance, nor homophobia. I 
think homosexuality is wrong 
because I happen to believe in a 
truth, or a moral law that sets 
down the rules of right and 
wrong. This moral law applies to 
everyone, forever, and does not 
become "outdated" because of 
what happens _to be popular at the 
time. 

Is this narrow-minded? You 
might say yes, but that would 
have no bearing on whether or 
not my belief is true. Now, 
unfortunately, my viewpoint is 
coming under increasing attack. 
Why? Because it is offensive, and 
in today's society, that cannot be 
tolerated. Earlier when I said 
Madden was wrong, I could 
almost hear the gasps of the peo-

THURSDAY, JANUARY 15,2004 THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 5 

Textbook prices a burden ' students should not have to bear 
Classrooms not an appropriate venue for political pandering 
horse's 

mouth 
EdWu 

T hese days, shopping for freshman science and engi-neering textbooks at the 
bookstore seems more akin to a 
trip to Costco rather than a jaunt 
to the corner market. 
Introductory textbooks for chem-
istry, caleul us and biology seem 
laden with all sorts of extraneous 
materials - CD-ROMs, answer 
keys and workbooks. 

While this writer really cannot 
call himself an expert - or even 
well-versed - in pedantic meth-
ods, a lot of the extra textbook bun-
dles seem more like a way to drain 
money out of students cowed into 
believing their education will be 
compromised unless they accede to 
spending upwards of $400 a quar-
ter. 

With student fees again heading 
upwards if the Gubenator gets his 
way, and less of that money direct-
ed back into student financial aid, 
the rather excessive premiums ori 
education that textbooks accrue are 
looking even more egregious. 

What alternatives are there for 
the cost-conscious science or 
engineering student? While this 
wri ter has largely avoided solution 
manuals and CD-ROMs if at all -

possible, that may not necessarily 
suit everyone. Another strategy is 
to avoid the bookstore entirely for 
introductory or popular courses 
and head to the General Store's 
quarterly book sale, where a fru-
gal student can accrue around $10 
savings a book if he or she is 
lucky. 

Often, one can find required 
textbooks cheaper online -
although this writer has heard from 
bookstore employees that it is poli-
cy to refuse to disclose ISBN num-
bers for textbooks over the phone, 
which would enable students to 
shop online for books even if they 
were out of San Diego for winter or 
summer breaks. (Insert your wor-
shiped deity here) forbid the book-
store actually serve students by 
helping them find cheaper text-
books when it instead could force 
them to come down to the store in 
the vain hopes of making a quick 
buck. 

The astute upper-division stu-
dent recognizes, however, that in 
many of her classes the textbook 
might very well see little to no use 
as the professor ambles off on his 
merry way through material pre-
sented entirely through lectures, 
supplementary notes provided on 
the Web, and class assignments, 
which render the book useless. 

No doubt many an astute (or 
sometimes lazy) political science or 
history major has oft figured out 
that 'required' reading turns out to 
count for only one question on the 
final exam, and often the main 

points and criticisms of 'key' texts 
are distilled into CliffsN oces' for-
mat during lecture anyway. 

This brings us back to the ques-
tion of why undergraduates are 
forced to play a crapshoot every 
quaner when buying books. While 
there is a survey question on 
C.A.P.E. that asks, "Was the 
required reading useful?" one won-
ders whether the question should 
actually read "Is the book worth 
buying given the way this professor 
teaches?" 

" While there is a survey 
question on C.A.P.E. 

that asks , 'Was the 
required reading useful?' 
one wonders whether the 
question should actually 
read 'Is the book twrth 

buying git'en the way this 
professor teaches?'" 

Hopefully, one of the myriad 
online community sites springing 
up to cover UCSD classes will 
choose to incorporate this valid 
question into its course analysis. 

Furthermore, while we can 
debate on the significance of the 
1972 presidential election, and a 

particular author's view on that 
election's effect on subsequent 
American politics may not be 
gleaned anywhere except from 
copyrighted material, one would 
hope that the topics of introducto-
ry chemistry is a bit more unani-
mous and much less proprietary. 

It seems there should be no 
reason why introductory science 
classes across the country should 
not move toward free online text-
book projects that all major uni-
versities can contribute to, offer a 
variety of voices, are constantly 
updated, and beSt of all, are com-
pletely free. Wikipedia, the online 
encyclopedia, has a nascent online 
project on the way (although it is 
unfortunately devoid of my useful 
material at the moment). MIT, on 
the other hand, has dedicated 
itself to posting course notes and 
online books for all of their cours-
es online, free for use without reg-
istration, in their 
Open CourseWare project, at 
http;//IKW.mit.tdu. 

The notes are available for a 
wide variety of classes from intro-
ductory calculus to advanced quan-
tum mechanics, and it would. 
behoove students who are confused 
by substandard, expensive text-
books to consult this alternate 
source of reading material. While 
MIT promises to be no less confus-
ing, seeing which concepts are sim-
ilar and thus core to the issue at 
hand always is a benefit to this 
writer when confronted by perplex-
ing coursework. 

While the middle of budget 
cuts might not be the best of times 
to launch a university-wide initia-
tive to craft textbooks for use 
across all elementary science and 
engineering classes, one wonders 
what the results would be if pro-
fessors and motivated students 
from all the UC campuses were 
given the opportunity to freely 
contribute and collaborate on 
introductory physics, calculus, 
and chemistry online textbooks, 
complete with alternate versions 
from different pedagogical meth-
ods. 

At the very least, there are 
already dozens of class notes post-
ed online in departmental servers 
and on online · class reserves. The 
library should be making . a for-
ward effort to get URLs from 
professors so they can archive 
notes on their own servers, and 
move toward maldng the non-
copyrighted and sapient materials 
on online course reserves avail-
able for public (or at least student) 
use in any quarter, even years after 
the original class. 

One might argue that open-
source problem sets are not the 
best way to assign graded home-
work, but on the other hand, that 
might be a niche market that text-
book marketers can exploit. 

Why not limit textbook makers 
to the only place where informa-
tion needs to be guarded and not 
free?

Letters: Problem of tolerance must be 
recognized on both sides of the spectrum 

continued from page 4 
pie reading this. How could I say 
.such a thing? Today, that's a judg-
ment that only one side -
Madden 's - is all owed to make 
anymore without being called 
names. Well, I apologize, but I 
prefer believing in something, 
even if it offends you, rather than 
forming my beliefs on what 
makes me, and everyone around 
me, feel good (which is exactly 
what society today does). 

I'd also like to comment on the 
authors claim that marriage has 
no sanctity, in which she cites a 
few startling statistics. True, the 
percentage of couples that divorce 
and engage in extramarital affairs 
is astonishingly high. However, 
I'd like to suggest that Madden go 
an.d tell the other 50 percent (at 
leist) of happily married couples 
that marriage has no sanctity. 
Good luck. 

I'd also like to support her in 
her challenge to the Bush admin-
isuation to work toward outlaw-
ing infidelity and divorce. It truly 
is a shame that the focus seems to 
always be on preventing homosex-
ual couples from being married. If 
all three of these issues were tack-
led, we'd score some major points 
for sanctity. 

Let me leave you with this. I 
speak for the majority of conserv-
atives, and Christians at the very 
least, when I say that the practice 
of homo exuality is outside the 
pale of acceptable morality. And if 
our "opinion" is actually, well, 
uue, then no one can faul t us fo r 
followi ng it. U nfortunately, 
defending its validity is a subject 
for another ti me. 

So call me what you will, but in 
doing so, you too will be engaging 

in an intolerant, ignorant and 
prejudiced behavior.

Supporters of both 
sides must consider 
their assumptions 

Editor: 
In an article published Jan. 9 

titled "Condemnation of homo-
sexual marriages outdated, hypo-
critical," Marianne Madden acci-
dentally commits the exact type of 
error she has so eloquently 
worked to defend. Certainly the 
theme of her article can be gener-
alized with the quote, "We should 
learn to appreciate diversity and 
learn a little lesson about love and 
alternative lifestyles." However, in 

the very same article she refers to 
the gay community as "Purple-
clad, hair-gelled, [and) designer-
clothed." She further states that 
"gay men happen to have an 
unflappable sense of style." 
Therefore, while attempting to 
aid the reader in understanding 
diversity, Madden has mistakenly 
stereotyped and labeled an entire 
community. Readers should 
understand that gay men are ath-
letes, cowboys, mechanics, doc-
tors, truck drivers and so much 
more. To state that we are all 
somehow fashion savant is mildly 
offensive. 

Furthermore, the author dis-
cusses gay men at length but only 
mentions lesbians once. She also 
fails to mention the bisexual and 
uansgender communities. [n 
actuality, when looking at the 
entire LGBT population, gay 
men are only half of the story. 

Finally, the author suggests 
that we embrace "alternative 
lifestyles." Being Lesbian G ay 
Bisexual Transgender is not an 
alternative lifestyle, because it is 
not freely chosen. In its strictest 
definition, an alternative is "the 
choice between two mutually 
exclusive possibilities." 

With most sincere gratitude I 
thank Madden for her support 
and courage. However, in the 
future, she may want to be more 
careful with the depth of subject 
matter in her articles. As my 
mother has always said, "paint-
ing someone's house for them 
ceases to be a favor if you have 
failed to ask what color they pre-
fer."

lecture by descri bing their cause in 
passing, talking about course credit

While this columnist usually avoids writing about sports, he does write to 
take a passing shot at Rush

After Donovan McNabb set a 
postseason rushing record for a 
quarterback in last week's NFL

worthwhile to poim 
out in Mr.

the educational 
process to get students involved in 
their community or even in some 
kind of political action. But on the 
other hand, how palatable would it 
be if the members of the CfliijUrnil1

at the stan of Math 20B to ask for 
members of the class to join in a rally 
later that day at Price Center for the

THURSDAY, JANUARY 15,2004 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

IRV: .Instant runoff voting runs into obstacle 
continued from page 1 

"Jeremy [Gallagher] and I are 
pursuing further conversations with 
ways in which we can work with 
StudentLink, such as offering to pay 
for the progranuners, or just [using) 
our own programmers, or potential-
ly get some third-party Web site 
instead of SrudentLink [to handle 
the election)," Chapman said. . 

A suaw poll taken at the A.S. 
meeting revealed strong council 
support for the use of instant 
runoff voting this year, even if it 
means conducting the election 
using paper ballots. 

Eleanor Roosevelt College Junior 
Senator Carol Freire said that when 
the election bylaws were 'changed to 
include instant runoff voting, 
StudentLink officials informed the 
council that it would be "no prob-
lem" to implement the new system in 
time for this election cycle. 

"I'm not opposed to paper tally-
ing ... because I think it would be a 
step backward for A.S. [not to use 
instant runoff voting)," Freire said. 

In insl3nt runoff voting, students 
rank candidates in order of prefer-
ence. If a candidate receives more 
than 50 percent of the first-choice 
rankings, that candidate wins. 

If no candidate receives more 
than 50 percent of the first-place 
ranlcings, the candidate who 
received the fewest first-place 
rankings is eliminated. Each first-
place vote for the eliminated candi-
date is uansfened to the voter's 
second choice. The process of 
elimination is repeated until a can-
didate receives over 50 percent of 
the first-place votes. 

The A.S. Voting Task Force, 
which met regularly last year, 
examined 10 different voting sys-
tems and conducted a mock elec-
tion to gauge student reaction to 
the task force 's top four choices, 
which led to their recommendation 
of instant runoff voting and its 
addition to the election bylaws. 

Freire said that it's not unusual 
for student governments to hire 
outside companies to run elections. 

"It would be better for us to just 
take it on. ourselves, but if we can't, 
then why not?" Freire said. 

A.S. StudentLink Advisory 
Committee Representative Vincent 
Pascual said that the first sign of 
trouble with StudentLink imple-
mentation came at a meeting over 
the sununer. 

"[The committee) said, 'We 
won't rank anything until we finish 
the current project batch,'" Pascual 
said. "I wish that the top members 
of the committee would have given 
a litde more advance notice about 
thi " s. 

Council members are still nego-
tiating with the administration to 
have instant runoff voting imple-
mented this year. Chapman hopes a 
final decision on the election 
method will be made as soon as 
possible, but no later than fifth 
week of winter quaner. 

"If we have to go back to paper 
ballots, thatS what it is," Gallagher 
said. "I don't foresee that happening, 
but we need to follow our rules." 

Access: Enrollment may decrease 10 percent 
continu£d from page 1 

pan to uphold the Master Plan and 
this commiunent continues today, 
but we also need the state to hold 
up its end of the bargain and pro- . 
vide funding for enrollment 
increases," UC spokesman Hanan 
Eisenman said. 

University officials on all levels 
are currently examining the gover-
nor 's propo.sal and preparing a 
response. Despite the proposal, 
admissions offices are currently ' 
carrying on with their normal 
admissions process. Admissions 
officers have already started r~ad­
ing applications for the 2004-05 
freshman class in a process that 
began in December and will con-
tinue until the last week of 
February. 

"We are doing the very thor-
ough reading that we always do, 
and at the end of the process, 
when we have a more definitive 
idea of how many students we can 
enroll, we will make a decision on 
where to set the cutoff," UCSD 
Director of Admissions Mae W. 
Brown said. 

Schwarunegger's budget plan 
proposes that UC-eligible stu-

dents who are not accepted should 
participate in a dual admissions 
program in which they would 
"enroll in a community college 
and transfer to a UC or CSU 
[campus) upon completing the 
requisite amount of uansferable 
lower-division units." The propos-
al allocates $500 per student to 
ensure that-they receive appropri-
ate academic counseling to pre-
pare them for uansferring during 
their time at a community college. 
The University of California cur-
rently has a separate dual admis-
sions program in which it admits 
high-achieving high school stu-
dents who are not UC-eligible 
under the provision that they com-
plete lower division coursework at 
a community college prior to 
enrolling at the University of 
California. 

History professor Michael 
Parrish said enrollment numbers 
suggest that the University of 
California currendy enrolls more 
than the top 12.5 percent of each 
graduating class. Nonetheless, 
Parrish believes that 
Schwarzenegger's proposal com-
promises the University of 

California's accessibility. 
"The Master Plan goes back to 

the early 19605 when then-UC 
President Clark Kerr was able to 
negotiate this conuact between 
the University of California, the 
California State University and 
the California community col-
leges and get the support of the 
governor and the legislature," 
Parrish said. "The state of 
California is betraying its historic 
promise with respect to the acces-
sibility and cost of higher educa-
tion. The governor speaks elo-
quently of K-12 education as if 
education ends at grade 12. That's 
JUSt ridiculous." 

According to the proposal, the 
California community colIege sys-
tem will be able to accommodate 
all qualified students and provide 
them with a quality education. 

"Community colleges provide 
quality undergraduate instruction 
at a significantly lower cost than 
that of the UC and CSU systems," 
Schwarzenegger's budget proposal 
stated. "Overall, sufficient access is 
provided in the Govem9r's Budget 
to ensure a place for every qualified 
student." 

Faculty: Some fear recruitment may suffer 
continued from page I 

those discussions, there will be a 
great deal of internal discussion 
and consultation to determine the 
best way to address what has been 
proposed." 

If the proposal stands, the $35 
million cut in spending on faculty 
will likely be an undesignated one, 
allowing campuses the discretion 
to make the cuts in a manner that 
would least impair any instruction-
al programs. 

"Right now, we are not sure of 
how we will implement the cut. 
The UC Office of the President 
will most likely give us flexibility 
so that we will know how to han-
dle this on a campus-by-campus 
basis," Pryatel said. "It takes a 
while to make these decisions, and 
as of now, we just have to slow 
spending so as to minimize any 
damage to programs when we do 
get the final .budget." 

To reach the objective of the 
governor's suggested increase in 
student-faculty ratio, the universi-
ty may have to discontinue recruit-
ing for open positions currently 
available. 

"We have been busy recruiting 
for these open positions, and it is 
possible that they will remain 
unfiUed due to the cut," Pryatel 
said. ·We are uncertain iE we will 
haft to layoff fKulty." 

Cost-oE-living wage adjust-

ments will again be denied to fac-
ulty this year, for the second year 
in a row. 

"There will be no cost-of-liv-
ing wage increases this year; there 
was none last year either," Pryatel 
said. "There is just no money pro-
vided by the state." 

However, faculty will be grant- _ 
ed merit increases, which usually 
come in a three-year cycle for fac-
ulty - in that only one-third is 
funded every year. 

Pryatel worries about the mes-
sage that the budget cut sends to 
people the university is trying to 
recrui t, as well as to professors at 
the universi ty. 

"It is very eIpensive to recruit 
new faculty," Pryatel said. "Salary 
not only comes as a factor, but 
they must consider the whole 
recruitnient package. It will be 
hard to compete for good profes-
sors with [the university) cutting 
positions and no salary increases." 

Charles Chamberlain, a profes-
sor in the literature department, 
shares Pryatel's concern that pro-
fessors may leave the university in 
search of better salaries and com-
pensations. 
. "I think we get paid well u it 
is," Chamberlain said. "My only 
worry is that [the university) won't 
be able to pay some hot-shot pro-
r-on - and I hate to lIy it, but 
there are IOIDe on this campus -

the salary that they want. As a 
result, they may be tempted to 
look elsewhere." 

Peter Ebenfelt, a mathematics 
professor, is concerned by the uni-
versity's ability to compete against 
other educational institutions if 
some professors transfer because 
of better offers. 

"One of the major concerns is 
how the wages at this university 
keep falling behind those of other 
institutions, which may move some 
professors to tum to a university 
that can offer a better salary," 
Ebenfelt said. "Any cuts are always 
unfortunate, but it all depends on 
how they are ' implemented in 
detail, and even now we're not sure 
of how these cuts will go." 

There is only a small amount of 
revenue, so any cuts that may be

our client base) likes it when our coupons are used. So here's the 
plan: 

Get your members to save receipts whenever they use Guardian 
coupons-or any ad for that matter. Each receipt will be worth 
$4 when turned into the Ad Mgr. to be exchanged each Thursday

The latest offering from garage-rockldream-pop 
hybrid Low Flying Owls offers little in the way of origi-
nality by mining some overwrought influences 
(Spacemen 3,jesus and Mary Chain), but than1cfully, the 
band mows how to make a consistent album - some-
thing which many of their counterparts have failed to do. 

The album begins with a trio of Stooges-inspired 
rockers that prepare the listener for a hazy, one-dimen-
sional set of songs. The songs ooze traShy chann, partic-
ularly the creepy "Looks of Killer," whose lyrics intone 
"you've got the looks of a killer, a killer who doesn't care." 
But the band wisely includes ballads, like the oddly poppy 
"Strange Connection" and the sexy instrumental "Babies 
Made," maybe one of the best song titles in recent mem-
ory. 

out counterparts. Only time will tell, but in 
the meantime, the 21-and-over crowd will 
have some sweetly stark tunes to accompa-
ny their night at the Casbah. 

Fonned in 2001, Low Flying Owls has 
quickJy developed a reputation for their 
darkly atmospheric music. They released 
the debut Take the Scmi, Route in 2001 to 
some critical attention. The album was 
nice enough but lacked a fully-formed 
sound, drawing too much from 
Radiohead-ish soundscapes and not pay-
ing enough attention to the songcraft. 
Since then, the band has shared the stage 
with an impressive list of artists such as 

knack for sticking surpris-
es into its complex songs. "Looks of a 
Killer," one of the band's catchiest and 
most haunting songs, continues past its 
expected ending with stopping and restart-
ing drums. "Strange Connection" starts off 
deceptively with glossy acoustic guitars but 
suddenly develops an offbeat pop hook 
worthy of an early Pink Floyd tune. It's that 
sound of a band constandy thinlcing and 
putting the extra effort into its songs that 
makes people take notice and come back 
for more. 

Low Flying Owls will play with newly 
reformed 1990s alt-rocker Urge Overkill 
at the Casbah ooJan. 15. 

The lyrics generally conjw-e up an uneasy drama typ-
ical of such stoner-rock releases, but Southard's delivery 
- whether he's invoking a screeching Nick Cave or a 
moaning Thom Yorke - is what sets the Low Flying 
Owls apart. It's a shame more is not made of the vocals, 
which usually take a backseat to the music's enjoyable but 
repetitive smoky atmospherics. Next time around, the 
band should realize it has an apt singer/songwriter in the 
group and let the songs themselves come to the forefront.

Firth, Johansson deliver lackluster performances 
Visuals, costumes are the only alluring thing about the mediocre 'Pearl' · 

By DEENA AL SHA111 
Associate Hiatus Editor 

Tracy Chevalier's novel "Girl with a Pearl Earring" is intri-cately beautiful in its descrip-
tions of artist johannes Vermeer's 
world through the eyes of his 
maid, Griet. The movie "Girl 
with a Pearl Earring," on the 
other hand, completely fails to 
bring this beauty to the screen. 

The film tells the story behind 
Vermeer's (played by Colin Firth) 
famous portrait, of a chambennaid 
named Griet (Scarlett Johansson) 
who inspires the portrait and the 

ramifications that come along with 
it. 

Starring two usually wonder-
ful actors, it's hard to figure out 
where this film went wrong. 
j ohansson portrays Griet with 
apathy, turning her into a charac-
ter that seems unaffected by the 
events she is involved in. 
Meanwhile, Firth depicts 
Vermeer with consistent deer-
caught-in-the-headlights looks, 
However, blame cannot be placed 
entirely on the actors. It seems 
that the writers completely forgot 
to include character development 
when they wrote the script. 

Courtnr of New'" 
Not • pm: Colin Firth and Sca~ett Johansson greatly disappoint as Griet and 
Vermeer in the flat lifeless 'Gi~ with a Peart Earring." 

The movie does not give you the 
background that the novel has, nor 
does it truly explore the characters. 
The viewer doesn't understllnd the 
significance of specific details that 
were glossed over in the film yet 
integral to character development in 
the book. 

The film briefly explores 
Griet's feelings of apprehension 
toward Pieter, the butcher's son, 
but the audience is left without a 
clear understanding of why. 
Without the necessary informa-
tion, the viewer is left feeling con-
fused as to why Griet acts the way 
she does towards different charac-
ters. Even more confusing is why 
Vermeer suddenly decides to hire 
Griet, as his assistant. The charac-
ter's are two-dimensional, Oady 
moving across the screen with no 
real purpose about them. 

The film is extremely choppy. 
Each scene is one to two minutes 
long before abruptly cutting to 
the next scene. It's almost as if the 
director was trying too hard to 
include as much as he could, but 
forgot to make the film' concise. 
None of the scenes really push 
the story forward; instead they 
almost grind it to a halt. It's quite 
the paradox: a movie with scenes 
that move too quicldy yet com-
pletely slow the movie down. 

Truly, the only masterful thing 
about this film is the visuals: The 
sets, the costumes and the cine-
matography are stunning. While 

Film 
REVIEW 

evetyone is screaming "Oscar!" 
for this film, the only part of it 
that truly deserves a nomination 
is the cinematography. Each 
scene is set beautifully, with cam-
era angles capturing the action in 
a nontraditional way. The sets put 
you into the time period of the 
17th century, and almost make 
you smell the turpentine and oil 
paints. Moreover, the costumes 
are wonderful and add to the 
realism of the sets (though Firth's 
wig needed some work). Most 
remarkable, however, is 
Johansson's resemblance to the 
actual painting. 

If you've been wanting to see 
this film, the best reason would be 
for its artistic merit. The cine-
matography, costumes and sets are 
visually arnuing. Meanwhile, the 
acting and plot leave much to be 
desired. Go see this film if you're in 
the mood to be disappointed.

One-sided 
'Monster' 

disappoints 
Film is merely a 

movie-of -the-week 
on the big screen 

By DAVID BYNUM 
Senior Staff Writer 

Hollywood has gone independent again, and this time it has creat-ed a monster. Ever since Halle 
Berry's Oscar award-winning per-
formance in "Monster's Ball," more 
than a few members of Hollywood's 
"A" list have been itching to prove 
themselves in independent movie 
houses across America. 

"Monster," starring Charlize 
Theron and Christina Ricci, is most 
definitely a film trying to replicate 
the success of "Monster's Ball" with 
a shockingly similar fonnula. The 
formula goes something like this: 
Take a Hollywood bombshell, stick 
her in a movie where she is fornicat-
ing with an unlikely partner (Berry 
has Billy Bob Thornton, and 
Theron has Ricci), throw it in inde-
pendent movie houses, and wait for 
the nominations to roll in. 
Unfortunately, this fonnula went 
terribly wrong and, indeed, a mon-
ster was born. 

The premise behind the film 
sounds intriguing enough; 
"Monster" is the true story of a 
hooker/serial killer (Aileen 
Wuomos) executed in Florida in 
2002 after being convicted of mur-
dering twelve of her johns. A trans-
formed Theron plays Aileen, while 
Ricci plays Selby, a naive lesbian. 
Selby turns Aileen towards lesbian-
ism over some beers, and hopes to 
live the fantasy life that comes along 
with being the lover of a $30-hook-
er in northeastern Florida. 

The fascination that often sur-
rounds the li~ of serial killers is 
the driving voyeuristic force in this 
film, but ultimately Wuomos was 
an unworthy candidate for such an 
undertaking. The film's attempts to 
evoke sympathy for Wuomos ulti-
mately fiail as a result of the 
thoughdess and often crazed nature 
of the killer. The film isn't objec-
tively, but unsteadily wavers 
between portrayals of Wournos. 
The mon: sympathetic light shows 
her as the unavoidable sum of the 
parts of her tragic life. Alternatively, 
she is portrayed as a female Gary 
Busey gone homicidal, incapable of 
evolring sympathy from the viewers. 

Ultimately, the film's purpose 
simply wasn't clear. Theron's 
annoying voice-overs give the entire 
film an x-rated movie-o{..the-week 
type feel. On top of this, the film 
tries - and fails - at the very last 
second to be a love story. Perhaps 
the film's biggest problem is that it 
is so violendy disturbing that it is 
difficult to care about what is going 
on in the rest of the film. It is a 
shame that Theron put on nearly 
thirty pounds to star in this 
Hollywood trend taken too far. 
Avoid this monster at all costs.

If Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald and Abbey Lincoln had a love child in 
Georgia 23 years ago, it 
would be Lizz Wright. 

Salt, Wright's debut 
release from celebrated jazz 
label Verve, is the revival of 
classy, elegant jazz of the 
1920s with a modem 21st-

With this album, Los Angeles' Phantom Planet shows they've 
caught the new wave that hit 
rock two years ago. These 
days, it hasn't been without 
obstacles: They lost drummer 
jason Schwanzmann, star of 
"Rushmore,'! to his acting 
career. While not crippling, 
this certainly deprived it of 
some star power. There were 
also difficulties on a musical 
front. These days. it's hard to 
sound like the Strokes with-

***~ 
cenrury twist. Wright has a 
gorgeously soulful alto voice 
that creates a lyrical melody 
for each word she purrs. 
Seasoned jazz musicians con-
tribute beautifully sophisticat-
ed instrumental arrangements 
to complement Wright's sur-
prisingly mature vocal styling. 
Her lyrics are an afterthought 

out being accused of trying to 
sound like the Strokes. But 
they shows off their new style 
with a large degree of success. 

Most of Phtmtum Pltmet is 
a far cry from the more sooth-
ing pop sounds that defined 
their earlier songs, such as 
"The O.c." theme song 
"California." With thrashing 
guitars, fierce bass line 
melodies and the relentless 
energy of new drummer Jeff 
Conrad, this latest album is 
one of unapologetic rock. 

to the trance of her voice, and 
are of a rather trite class of a 
"country girl in the big city" 
exploration of feelings. 
However, with her amazing 
voice, the sophisticated 
instrumental arrangements 
and industry legend produc-
ers (Tommy LiPulma, Brian 
Blade, and Jon Cowherd), Salt 
is barely halted by the slightly 
underdeveloped songwriting. 

This debut is what the 
modern jazz world needs, a 
charming chanteuse with 
vocal talent to hold her 
weight for the next genera-
tion of jazz music. 

-AnnShen 
Stllff Writer 

The album's opener, "The 
Happy Ending," makes the 
album ironic because of its 
placement, as do songs about 
bad endings, li ke the ballad 
"You're Not Welcome Here." 
Phtmtum Plimn is driven less 
by lyrical content than it is by 
melodies and unyielding 
beats. 

There are moments the 
band seems unable to recon-
cile its conunitment to riding 
rock's new wave with its undy-
ing urge to provide catchy, 
poppy runes. In some places 
Alexander Greenwald's lead 
vocals bear an almost uncanny 
resemblance to those of 
Strokes' frontman julian 
Casablancas. But on the 
whole, the album doesn't suf-
fer as a result.

TIiURSDAY, JANUARY J 5, 2004 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Late night shows are a force to be reckoned with 
'Daily Show,' leno' give truer political information than the news 

short kids 
are cool 

Jessica Kruskamp 

At about 10:58 p.m. in the White House, boots should be kicked off and the presidential polllto 
should settle down on the couch, 
because the acerbic Jon Stewart of 
"The Daily Show" is about to lash 
out. 

All bets are on that Stewart does 
indeed mess with Texas. And Mars. 
And - I'll put at least a fiver on this 
one - it will be highly entertaining. 

Let's just hope the White House 
is well -equipped with extended 
cable. 

Politics and entertainment go 
hand-in-hand nowadays, and people 
are listening. Whether people (VOt-
ers) laugh or are outraged seems 
inconsequential because the point is 
that they are listening. Such "enter-
tairunent" suddenly isn't so fluffy 
with the current national affairs and 
a presidential race coming up. 
Remember, Stewan is beamed to 
households with eager viewers each 
night (plus reruns). 

Hopefully, all that foreign policy 
hasn't worn G.W. out, because it 
would probably be in his best inter-
est to resist the sandman another 
half hour to catchJay Lenos mono-
logue on"The J'onight Show." After 
all, the president can tell his first lady 
that he's late to the sack because he's 
doing important campaign research. 
The president himself should be taIc.-
ing notes, though there are probably 
legions of late-night rube-watchers 
in the Bush Brigade who scour the 
shows to see wlut's being said; if they 
don't exist, they should. 

Someone from every campaign 
needs to form a committee. Or a 
subcommittee. ,Something. 

Stewart, Leno and others like 

them have managed to find truths 
in political morass and have capillll-
ized on the fact that, at basic levels, 
America's elected and would-be 
leaders provide pure hilarity on a 
daily basis. 

(In fact, I thought ultra-conser-
vative commentator-turned-author 
Ann Coulter was taking a more 
absurdly extreme satirical approach 
in the enterlllinment industrylFox 
News world when she first hit the 
scene. I discovered I was very, very 
wrong, and she slllrted to be Slllr-
t1ingly less funny.) 

Recently, "The Daily Show" 
invited a NASA engineer to spealc. 
with Stewart and explain to him why 
exactly the United Sllltes was 

" After all, the president 
can teU his first lady that 

, he 's late to the sack 
because he's doing ... 
campaign research. " 

trekking to Mars, and why the presi-
dent wanted to send Americans to 
the Red Planet. 

Stewan leaned into the camera 
and surreptitiously whispered "I 
think its because he's given up here." 

Well, the~. Maybe this adminis-
tration has given up and there truly 
are better opportunities and cheap-
er real eSlllte in the final frontier. 

Where does that leave the MTV 
Generation? Well, VJs Sway and 
Suchin Pak deliver hourly, bite-sized 
doses of news every hour to fight 
ignorance and light a fire, but even 
they can't fight the power of Leno 
and his memorable jokes. 

"Dean got so cold [in the 
Midwest) the foam around his 
mouth slllrted to freeze," Leno said 
in a recent monologue. 

Step aside, Sway. Entertainment 

(MTV) that devotes a half-minute 
of news (cleverly named "MTV 
News") squashed between bootyli-
ciousness and bar fights on Real 
World San Diego does not cut it. 
Late-night shows have the leg up in 
the race to spread awareness. 

Forget the MTV Generation. 
These late-night news shows are 
garnering the attention much big-

Lewis leaned toward Stewart and 
pointed at his face. "I get my news 
from you," Lewis said. "And Mars." 

Even Newsweek caught on that 
Stewart has something going here. 
In its annual "Who's Next" issue, 
Stewart graced the cover and the 
title "Seriously Funny" was embla-
zoned across his chest. The issue 
was snatched off newsstands by 
consumers across the nation. 

Late-night entenainment shows 
are a force to be reckoned with in 
the race for the Democratic nomi-
nation and the subsequent presi-
dential campaign. 

Sen. John Edwards (D - N.C.) 
announced his presidency on "The 
Daily Show."lnitially, some thought 
it was a joke, but soon everyone 
knew it was very real. 

Arnold Schwarzenegger dubi-
ously looked at the audience on the 
"Tonight Show" and revealed he 
would enter the gubernatorial race 
for the California recall election. It 
was pure late-night fodder, and it 
was recognized as such. Hosts 
pounced and political jokes ensues. 

After the esteemed governor of 
California submitted his budget, 
Leno claimed that the services for 
women who have been sexually 
harassed will be the first thing to 
go, in a nearly perfect accent that 
all the late-nighters have perfected 
to the last spiny syllable. 

The truth is that entertainment 
is what educates voters now, and 
now it is the time for my favorite 
politicians (ahem, in Iowa) to figure 
that out quick.. 

No cracker for the overly dull 'Polly' 
Supporting casts make up for the insipid lead performances 

By ANNA DYLEWSKA 
Senior Staff Writer 

Generally film trailers are sup-posed to show scenes that appeal to audiences ' whi le 
retaining some juicy bits of footage 
for the fuJI feature. However in some 
cases, due to a limited nwnber of 
enticing clips, a preview can actually 
give away the best elements of a film, 
thus spoiling the movie. That is pre-
cisely the problem with "Along 
Came Polly." The film is a typical 
mixture of choppily edited gross-out 
scenes built into a more humane 
romantic story. Ben Stiller is Reuben 
Feffer, a neurotic risk assessor, who 
takes a chance at romance with the 
noncommittal Polly Prince Oennifer 
Aniston) after he catches his wife 
Lisa Kramer (Debra Messing) doing 
much more than just scuba diving 
with the French nudist Claude 
(Hank Azaria) on their honeymoon. 

In terms of the repulsive comedy, 
by now you've all seen the blind fer-
ret running into walls, the sweaty 
basketball player smearing his grime 
all over Feffer's face, and Feffer's 
boss Stan lndursky (Alec Baldwin) 
caressing Stillers ear in the bath-
room, then giving Feffer a friendly 
slap on rear. Unfortunately, that is 
the gist of the film - and all of that 
comes through in the trailer. 

Stiller, once again, blandly talc.es 
on his typical role of an average loser 
who is as aggressive as a butterfly. 
The actor unleashes his overused 
inventory of lacial expressions, but in 
this case they fail to chann or inspire 
pity. Aniston Iilc.ewise remains within 
her limited range with a character 
that is supposedly wild and carefree 
and yet somehow awestruck by the 
lifeless Feffer. Their chemistry is as 
arousing as a piece of dry baric. 

The one thing that can be said 
about these characters is that they

Film 
REVIEW 

perfectly match the ovemsed plot-
line in which the biggest risk ends up 
being the most rewarding choice. 

The supporting cast members, in 
particular Philip Seymour HolIman, 
Baldwin and Azaria, ideally Illclde 
their oddball personas, and their 
brief scenes elicit the biggest laughs. 

As Sandy 'Lyle, Hoffman brings 
hwnanity to the role of a tasteless 
s1ader who lives in denial and has 
delusions of grandeur afrer acting in 
one successful film years earlier. 
When Lyle finally discovers that his 
ambition cannOt compensate for his 
lack of talent, Hoffman perfonns a 
genuine, disappointing realization in 
the most emotional scene in the film. 
Baldwin adds seriousness and COD-
trol to create a realistic boss who says 
WlSuilllble things at the most inop-
portune times. Although Azaria's 
screen time is reduced to three short 
sequences, he nicely captures an 
amicable foreign lover and his over-
the-top accent is hysterical. These 
actors are definitely the highlight of 
the film. It is unfortunate that their 
work is placed on the backburner 
behind the two over-hyped lovers.

9. "Who's the guy in the 
striped shirt and why does he 
keep throwing trash on the 
field?" The gendemen with the 
striped shirts are the officials, and 
it's not trash, it's a penalty flag! 

8. "How long until the half-
time show comes on?" I'm not a 
huge fan of the Socratic method, 
but if you are, I'd encourage the 
following response: "Do you think 
maybe people watch this game for 
something other than the halftime 
show and the commercials?" 
However, depending on your audi-
ence, you may get a blank stare in 

response to that question. 
7. "Wait, aren't they going 

the wrong way? They were 
going the other way last time!" If 
explaining switching sides at the 
end of each quarter seems a bit 
daunting, you could always just say 
that they moved the camera to the 
other side of the field. 

6. "Why do they keep slapping 
each other's butts?" Some ques-
tions are better left unanswered. 

S. "How come it's a penalty 
for just barely moving? What if 
he bad to sneeze or something?" 
Unfortunately, the sneezing el[Cep-
tion - Rule 34d, Section 2 - was 
phased out in 1973 due to mali-
cious "fake sneezers."

Cyn City: Few student athletes 
realize what's really important 

continutd from flOIe 16 
receive better treattnent. It\; no won-
der why other athletes expect their 
homework to be done and their 
papen to be written for them. It 
stans early. It's an ugly and destruc-
tive pattern that starts developing 
from the get-go. Apparendy, many 
of these promising young athletes 
are taught to just worry about play-
ing weU and winning - instilling the 
idea that that's all they need to be 
important. Of course, this isn't true 
for all of them; there are many who 
realize the importance of academics 
and hard work in addition to being a 
star athlete. 

However, there's more than 
enough who are taught the opposite. 
It saddens me, because many of these 
Division I athletes that my friend 
tutors finnly believe that aU they're 
good for is sports. So many of these 
touted athletes, as hard as it is to the 
stomach, are told, "Well, you're 
black, so you won't amount to much, 
so you might as well only think 
about being good at sports." Some of 
them would even say, "Oh, I don't 
need to worry about my grades, 
coach says he'll talce care of it. 
Besides, I'm malcing it to the pros so 
I don't have to worry about graduat-
ing anyway." 

Unfortunately, they don't realize 
that many of them won't even get 
considered for the pros. For exam-
ple, only 1.3 percent of NCAA 
seniors get drafted in the NBA But 

their coaches lead them to believe 
otherwise so they can get them into 
the college to play for them. What 
they don't know is that when they 
don't get the call on draft day or they 
get cut in the ~n, they'U have 
to rely on the -skiDs" they learned 
off the field. But they won't have the 
practical skills they were supposed to 
learn in college and high school. 

Despite the apathy toward athlet-
ics that is rampapt at UCSD and 
despite the fact that many of our 

perenni~lly successful teams are 
hardly recognized, our school at 
least attempts to instill the value of 
hard work and refuses to give anyone 
an easy way out. UCSD will gradu-
ate athletes who have learned the 
tools to help them succeed beyond 
sports. I noticed that many seniors 
who bid farewell to their teams this 
past fall would be moving on to big-
ger and better things. I'm sure 
they've applied the same, if not 
more, dedication to their studies as 
they did on the court, in the water or 
on the field. That same work ethic 
will translate for them either in grad 
school or the jobs they begin right 
away. And that is the advantage they 
hold over the athletes who don't 
have professors or coaches teaching 
them to survive without sports.

ball. Not tOO tough, but if all else 
fails, just cheer when the people 
around you do. 

3. "Are you listening to me?" If 
the game is on, and your friend is 
into it, assume "no" is the answer to 
this question. Important plans are 
best discussed at a later time. 

2. "What's the score?" 
"It's 7-7." 
"So who's winning?" 

Shockingly, when the teams have 
the same number of points, it's 
called a tie. By definition, a tie 
means no one is winning. 

1. "Is there something else 
on?" No.

entirety of it." 
Although the sport itself is 

individually based, the UCSD 
swim team is not just a group of 
swimmers winning for them-
selves. It is described by many 
as a "family" and support 
group. 

"This team is very strongly 
united," UCSD swimming head 
coach Scott McGihon said. 
"There is no one person who is 
more important than another. 
Everyone's out to help the other. 
In Rosanna's case, she is an 
inspiration to the younger swim-
mers. She's a hard worker, and 
that makes everyone else want to 
keep up." 

When the regular season 
comes to a close, Delurgio will 
be facing the competition at the 
NCAA Tournament in Buffalo, 
N.Y., and afterward she'll be 
striving to achieve her goal of 
becoming an Olympic athlete. 

Get to know her face really 
well, folks: you could be brag-
ging about her in the next

Delurgio. 

Although quiet in demeanor, 
Delurgio has been raising eye-
brows across the nation for quite 
some time. The eight-time A11-
American swimmer currently 
holds the NCAA Division II 
record in the 100- and 200-yard 
breaststroke with times of 1 
minute, 1.88 seconds and 2: 15.8, 
respectively. The John Muir

Bryce Warwick 

Y;u've heard it said that there's no such thing as a stupid question. I'm here to tell you 
that whoever told you that was 
probably a stupid-question-asker 
himself and was just seeking to save 
himself from ridicule. In fact, there 
are a lot of stupid questions you 
couJd ask, but perhaps for the die-
hard ports fan , there are none 
more infuriating than the kind that 
are asked during the fourth quarter 
of a big game. With the NFL play-
offs in full swing and the Super 
Bowl just a couple of weeks down 
the line, here are some questions to 
avoid asking during the big game 
for the non-football fan who is 
interested in preserving a harmo-
nious relationship or friendship.

tough competitor on the collegiate 
scene, but on the national radar as 
well. Last June, Delurgio was fea-
tured in the "Faces in the Crowd" 
section of Sports Illustrated maga-
zine. 

The Santa Cruz, Calif., native 
has been swimming competitively 
for the past 11 years. Even with 
many years of swimming experi-
ence, she still finds the past three 
years with UCSD's swim team to 
be particularly fulfilling. 

"I've had the opportunity to 
swim for amazing coaches and 
with an amazing team which really 
does act as my family here in San 
Diego," Delurgio said. "It is defi-
nitely a unique experience that I 
wouldn't trade for anything -
even an athletic scholarship." 

The team typically meets nine 
times a week to practice if there is 
no meet and eight times a week if 
there is one.

Her forte: Junior Rosanna Delurgio will compete in the 2DO-yard breaststroke 
event at the Olympic Trials held in Long Beach, calif., from Ju~ 7 through July 14. 

"Swimming is very addictive 
once you find that you love it," 
Delurgio said. "Every athlete has 
a bit of a burn-out, especially 
after such a long season like 
swimming. But I'm surrounded 
by truly inspiring people who are 
extremely enthusiastic. It is con-
tagious, and that makes it very 
difficult to get tired of swimming. 
They constantly challenge me to 
be a better person in and out of 
the water, and I love being a part 
of it."

it came down to, we were ecstatic 
at the results. I've never been so 
proud to be a swimmer," she said. 

An expert on swimming's tough 
training regime, Delurgio believes 
her sport is different than most 
competitive sports. 

On Jan. 10, Delurgio placed 
second in both the 100- and 200-
yard freestyle event against 
Division I University of Utah. Due

Perhaps the biggest highlight 
of Delurgio's swimming career 
was at the NCAA 
Championships in North Dakota 
last year wheA her 400-yard 
freestyle relay team beat Drury 
University, landing the UCSD 
squad in third place. 

"Swimming is definitely one 
of the most challenging sports on 
both the mind and body," 
Delurgio said. "I'm not just say-
ing that because I do it, but 
because I don't really know of 
many other sports that require 
you to train year-round and at 
such a high level for almost the

1,000 entries from IS colleges

This year, UCSD brought a 
six-couple Latin Medley forma-

as the theme. The Medley consist-

"Matt's number-one asset is 
mental toughness," former 
UCSD teammate senior Geoff 
Rapoport said. "Every time Matt 
rolls up to the start line, he races 
like his life depends on it. The 
Parish guys are lucky to have him 
on their side." 

The Parish Foundation is an 
organization that supports cancer 
patients, their families and their

I n my last column, I talked about a friend of mine who rutors ath-letes at a prominent Division I

Meanwhile, the collegiate 
mountain bike season has con-
cluded, and UCSD placed seventh 
in the Western Collegiate Cycling 
Conference. This is the team's 
first time back after a few seasons 
of hiatus. 

"It was great because we 
placed higher than BYU-Idaho," 
UCSD head coach Peter Edwards 
said. "They're always a contender 
at nationals. But everyone worked 
hard putting in extra practice 

"I'm pretty excited about being 
back in the states, racing for and 
with riders I really respect," 
Sadauckas said. "It's going to be a 
great year."
