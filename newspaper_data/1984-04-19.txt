AS Council stipends: 
A campaign issue? 
By CHRISTOPHER CANOLE 

Last ntght the ~ Coun<.:i l voted 7 -4-4 aga inst appropnating a seedi ng stipend of 
SI2LO lor thc Itrst month 01 next year's Coun<.:tl. but the dehate over tht.: Issue 01 
supendmg UC 'D's AS Council lor the Itrst IIIIlC In our hiStory has not ended. 

The Issue of whether o r nOl to stipend Coun<.:tI members was prescnted as a 
referendum on the spring quarter AS cicClllln ballot last year. The 16% 01 the 
studcnt bod)' thm votcd rejened the pmpt'sed stipends hy J margin 01 77 .6"to 
agalllst , 104% lor and l2 .0% undedded. ' 

On March 1601 th iS year, the A::, Counctl voted "in theory" in lavor 01 stipends 
for CounCIl members III an acdanation (yea/ nay) vOte. This vote remailled largely 
unnoticed until this quarter's AS elections. 

This week, the AS Council's stipend vOle and pendll1g stipend allocation vote 
has become a hotly c.:ontested campaign issue. Two flyers being distributed claim 
the "in theory vOle" is a eonfikt 01 interest both lor those on the Council thts year 
running lor office and a conflict ot intent arter the Council has cut many 
organizational budgets to save money. 

The entire UCSD student body has the right to know the issues al hand If in la(t 
they are related to the present AS election. But since the crucial agenda of last 
night's CounCil meeting was not available ro the general campus commulllty, the 
UCSD GlJardian now presents statements from all Council members who 
responded to our inquiries, and voted for or against lunding the stipends they 
voted for in theol)'. 
CRAIG LEE [not allowed to vote I 

"After two quarters. anyone <.:an seek lundi ng that was rejected on a referendum. 
For instance, the California Rcvu:w could have apphed for tundlng this spring 
quarter. Therefore, It is nOt inappropriate lor the Council to allocate stipends now. I 
think the people are.getting the issues mixed up. We are not voting it for thiS year's 
Council; it is for nexl year. We paystipends for ASIO and US Grants, so why not us? 
CAROL ROGERS [fori 

"I am in favor 01 stipends because right now I have three Jobs, I am not on 
fi nan<.:lal aid, but there IS no \\lay sludents should be lorced to do a Job Without 
bell1g paid ." 
MARC BOR OITSKY labstall1ed l 

"I support our student referendum v.otes lor the one year they are effective. I 
would sacrilke stipends next year JUSl so we could have stipends Startll1g 111 the 
furure ." 
GREG HEMPERLY Iforl 

"Stipends has been a oncept the A'> has tried 10 pass ror several years, Most 
students do not realize what Council members are dOll1g. AI the beginnll1g of this 
reJr, several members didn 't do anything. By being a<.:countable through stipends 
they would do more. We should be given something to make us accountable 10 a 
higher authority." 
KEN DAVENPORT lagains t l 

"We hear "II thiS VirtUOUS talk about a higher body to keep people accountable, 
but until we lirst establish that board, how can we vOle the funds before we have a 
way to regulate the lunds? There are many people here tonight who have a chance 
of benefiting from tonight'S vOle. To aVOid a c.:onfiict of interest, we at this time 
<.:annot responsibly aUocate this money. We need to set up the methods hrst." 
GREG KRU 'E [agall1stl 

"I think It is ridiCulous that weare votingourselve, the money. ThiS year's budget 
IS so light , how can we vote to stipend ourselves? I am sure you have heard of the 
'one quarter only' tuition raise . Do you reaUy think next year's Council will vote not 
to bc made? Th is is an $1 1,000 issue thar you are not takll1g to the students, and yet 
there is a $20.000 referendum on the ballot that the CounCil feels should be up 
before the students." 
GREG RICKS [abstainedl 

"There are people in thiS room that have nOl even done anything lor the whole 
year. Having to account lor a stipend will make us more accountable. The money 
aspect would give the Board of Evaluations leverage 111 their control of the AS 
Council." 
DAVID CARREL [against] 

"In general , I am for stipends but not for the bi ll being presented this evening. 
ThiS bill advocates paying for the first month's st ipend for next year's Council. The 
problem here is that next year's Council will claim this was a decision made by the 
prevIous Coundl , so it IS appropriate to cont inue the lunding tor the remainderof 
the year under the guise 01 tradition. This is like trying 10 foo l the town idiot. Last 
spring's sllpend relerendum is Itke thiS year's media relerendum; they were hoth 
created with wording 10 railroad through the issue to the naive voter." 
ANNETTE ROBERTS [abstallled] 

.. It crcate, an elitist situation when only well -to-do students can alrord to run to 
be AS oUKers. I am a I'tnan<.:ial aid student. One way to give more people a chan<.:e to 
be<.:Ome an AS olll<.:<:r IS to <.:reate stipend,. I would suppOrt a public referendum, but 
not like last spnng when the students were not well Inlormed on [he issues." 
LAURA DRAKE IJgainst] 

"I am against stipends because I feel being on the AS Council is a servi(e given 10 
the student body from those who are Interested . It seems 10 me that the students 
who are lor stipends are from wealthy lamilies and those opposed are not. 
ObVIOusly, a<.:cordlng to last sprtng's referendum, the students don 't want their 
money spcnt for stipends. I don'tagree with the argument that Just because a ll other 
UC <.:ampuses grant stipends, we should . Our AS this year is too preoc(upied with 
imitating other UC campuses. The AS has been preoccupied with <.:uttll1g the 
budget aU year. Then aU 01 iI sudden, they want to allocate money to themselves. 
ThiS <.:onslltute!> a disservice to the students: 
STEVE COOPER [againstl

KSDT's budget to save mone)' bcL:aU5C we lell they were 110( dotnA thtlr Job. Third

Pomp for the 
new President 

By JAMES RALPH PAPP 
Thursday last, representatives of over 

a hundred colleges and a score of 
learned societies, chancellors, regents, 
musi<.:ians, a number of shamelessly 
bored stale offiCials and a motley 
representation of supporters filled the 
newly but only partiaUy renovated Royce 
Iiall AudllOrium for the inauguration of 
DaVid Pierpont Gardner as President of 
the University 01 California. 

Royce Hall , an affair of a sort of 
Mediaeval ecclesiasti<.:al style that gave 
up halfway m despair, witnessed with 
remarkable equanimity the unheard of 
spectacle of free vISitor parktng at

witnessed greater spectaeles than that , 
tneludl ng the four million people who 
have passed Ihrough its doors and 
stood and stared agog at its 
dlsappeanng panels , engraved horn tiles 
and other aspects of ItS Intenor 
decoration. 

If Royce Hall AuditOrium IS 100 much 
dwelt upon here, the fault must be 
excused, for at the inauguration It 
proved almost as populii- a ubJect as 
Dr Gardner, and the president se rved

On Aprtl 2 an abortion article 
by Christopher Canole was 
published by the GuardIan. The 
article seemed quite Informative, 
yet it did not quite live up to its 
thesis' "to gain a complete 
understanding and develop a 
balanced emotional and rational 
attitude towards the campus 
policies on abortion" and. one 
presumes. towards abortlon itself. 
It might have made a start in this 
direction , but it also ignored a 
crucial question: is abortion 
wrong? 

I know you'll scream "There is 
no wrong!" but please read on. 
First let me point out that 
religiOUS convictions are 
irrelevant. Even atheists and/ or 
moral relativists almost always 
believe in this: that it is wrong to 
harm another person (a position 
most theists hold also). You can 
see where this is going. If a fetus 
is a person then anyone who 
holds to the above philosophy 
would say that abortion is wrong, 
regardless of their religiOUS 
position. 

Note that I said if a fetus is a 
person. To some this is a big if: 
we'll never all agree on it. they 
say. That may be, but if you view 
killing as a (or the) prime evil yet 
merely shrug your shoulders and 
state that the issue is toO 
complex , you are not being 
consistent. If we do not want to 
harm people then we should be 
very careful in the area of 
abortlon. This may sound strict. 
but remember there is a pOSSIble 
life at stake. 

Now here I could go on and 
deal with the evidences of the 
abortion Issue. but I am really on 
the fnnge of thiS controversy. 

others can do a better job. This is 
only a preliminary discussion 
before you view the issue. You 
should listen to the arguments of 
both sides and critically evaluate 
them. Also, the burden of proof 
should fall on those who support 
abortion. Why? Because If we do 
not aboort and are wrong we 
inconvenience a life , but If we do 
abort and are wrong we end a 
life On the scales of the above 
world view murder weighs more 
than inconvenience (or whatever 
you choose to call It) . 

Another problem I had with 
this article was the history section 
dealing with the events of 1588. 
Although Mr. Canole probably did 
not mean it in this way, that 
portion could slill be read to 
imply that anyone who does not 
believe in some sort of "grace 
period" for abortion is "anti-sex." 

In summary, if you postulate 
that harming other people IS 
wrong. you had better make sure 
that fetuses are not people. If you 
cannot then do not abort. I would 
love to return to pregnant women 
"a positive sense of being in 
control of their lives." but not if it 
means taking the lives of others.

Editor: 
David Wolfs suggestion 

(Guardl£lll ,April 12) th<tt "a p .. 11 
has been c .. sf' ove r the 
Department of Political Science 
because so many of its facult)' 
have been awarded sabbaticals 
and fellowships suffers from .. 
pall of its own makmg caused by 
exaggemtion of the consequences 
for students and some apparent 
mIsunderstanding of what IS 
.. ctuall), happening 

It IS normal for a cerw in 

number of faculty to take 
sabbatical leaves each year. 
Universiry rules require that no 
leave can be approved unless 
appropriate arrangements are 
made to meet teaching 
responSibilities. Political Science 
has always used such 
opportunities to ,Ippoint visitors 
who can cover baSIC requirements 
and offer courses otherwise not 
given . Students benefit from the 
chance to study with highly 
regarded teachers from other 
ins[I[utions. in this country and 
abroad. and from a wider menu 
of course offerings. 

It happens that in the coming 
year the number of faculry in this 
department who will be on leave 
is unusually high - seven out of 
the total of "195' on the roster. 
Arrangements are being made to 
appOint temporary replacements. 
As always. they will be 
outstanding teachers like Henry 
Ehrmann of Dartmouth. our 
much-admired perennial winter 
visitor. Neither in terms of quality 
or quantity of offerings Will 
instruction suffer. 

Mr. Wolf seems to labor under 
a misunderstanding of what is 
entailed in the receipt of faculty 
fellowships . He reports that 
faculty members seek such 
fellowships in the hope of finding 
"greener pastures" on other 
campuses. and wonders what will 
happen to students as "the 
greater part of a departmental 
staff packs up and starts looking 
for opportunities elsewhere ." 
Perhaps he IS confusing tWO types 
of fellowships . Student 
fellowships are stipends awarded 
by universities to enahle gIrted 
and need)' applicants to enroll In 
theIr graduate progr.lms. Facult), 

fellowships - like the 
Guggenheim awarded Arend 
Lijphart. the German Marshalls 
awarded Peter Gourevltch and 
David Laitin . the Rockefellers 
awarded Peter Cowhey and Susan 
Shirk - are "leave fellowships" 
that enable professors to take 
time off from teaching in order to 
concentrate on research and 
writing for limited periods of 
time. usually a year. Sometimes. 
as in the case of Ellen Commiso's 
fellowship from the Center for 
Advanced Study in the Behavioral 
Sciences in Palo Alto, the grant is 
for work to be done at the center 
that makes the award. but 
normally the recipients do not go 
to other campuses unless their 
research requires it. (Some 
recipients merely hole up in a 
library or laboratory and politely 
decline to serve on committees.) 

Since such fellowships are 
given by competitive peer review. 
their award is a sign that the 
recipients are highly regarded for 
their previous scholarly work. It 
goes without saying that when a 
department receives a large 
number of such awards, some of 
the prestige rubs off on the 
department - and on its 
students. when the)' apply for 

. .. dmission to graduate and 
professional schools. 

In short. no UCSD student 
need fe .. r th .. t the Department of 
Polltic .. 1 Science is .. bout to risk 
its h,lrd-won reput .. tion for 
excellence in teaching. and all 
our majors can take added 
comfort from the fact that the 
uepartmcnt is achieving ,m 
cquall)' strong rcputallon for its 
contrrhutinns to scholMshlp.

By PHIL LAUDER 
It happened to me last Wednesday ... 

for the first tim. ever. It was a nightmare 
come true. 

Just a few hours earher. before going to 
bed. I had set my clock radio alarm for 
7: 16, allowing my brain a litde time to 
recover from the shock of a new day 
before heading to school for my 9 am 
thermo. exam. The "exam" was onl), a 
quiz. one of nine for the quarter. but a 
test 's a test. and I thought it would be 
nice to at le .. st allend. 

So I set my alarm and drifted off into 
my dream world , plaCing my full 
confidence in the little brown box th .. t 
sits upon my night stand. It would wake 
me up on time. It always had ; II always 
would . It likes me. 

I awoke In the morning withoul the 
aid of the alarm. I thought, "Strange - I 
feel pretty rested considering how early it 
must be." Since no alarm had sounded 
yet. I figured it was still before 7. I also 
figured I should check to be sure. So I 
turned my head .. .. 

Big blue digits stared at me, and I 
stared right back. Nine colon one six. 
9:16 am. That's 16 minutes past my 
grade . 

VISIOns of sleeping right through 
morning midterms or finals make up one 
of many college-rype nightmares. 
Another Involves the Chancellor 
personally handing you your notice of 
academic probation - with your parents 
at his side , shaking their heads and 
crying, "Where did we go wrong?" 
Another involves the great graduation 
check-out gate. You and your friends are 
all going through the supermarket. type 
registers. and as each of your comrades-
in-arms over the past four to ten years 
passes through the gates that separate 
college and the real world . you are told 
by the clerk the eqUivalent of, "We don 't 
accept MasterCharge. Next.. .. " And then 

you wave your farewells to your 
graduated friends. and you cry. And 
hopefully you wake up. 

It took me over a minute to wake up 
Wednesday morning - a minute of 
staring at those horrid numerals. Nine 
colon one six - now nine colon one 
seven. Finally the shock hit my adrenal 
glands. which in turn pUlnped my 
system full of the stuff that got me from 
my apartment bed to my classroom seat 
within ten minutes. 

But before f would end my staring 
match while still lying in bed. I had to 
find our what wellt wrong. AI .. rm clocks 
JUSt don't wig out like that . Cerh1inly no 
self-respecting clock radio of mine 
would . 

My first clock I r.eceived when D .. d got 
hImself a new one. I Inhented hiS - a 
bbck. rather ugly Viscount-bmnd clock 
radio with - get this - an actual clock 
face on It. You know, with the numbers 
one through J 2 arranged in a circular 
fashion and two pointy things, one 
longer than the other. radiating from the 
center in the generafdirection of a 
number. This archaIC creature has gone 
the w .. y of the passenger pigeon and Cra 
magnon man by now, but I liked mine. 
The only feature I didn't like was liS 
alarm - sc .. red the p .. ncreas out of me. 
Sneak up on a de .. d person at 6:30 in the 
morning sometime. and bring along a 
rape whistle. Empty out your lungs into 
rhe sleeping beauty'S ear via the whistle, 
and you'll see the response this clock's 
alarm evoked from me. I just used the 
radio to get me up. using the siron for 
emergency situations only. 

It was only last year when the Viscount 
died on me. It was a sad moment. I still 
have ItS remains. 

I went out .. nd bought a new clock 
mdio. a newfangled version. This one is 
about half the size of a tissue box .

UCSD's conselVatives: 
more potlitical than social 
By PAUL LAZERSON 

A LM Angdc:s Timcs article says that In a reversal of roles, conservallvc political columnists are now In greater demand than 
their liberal colleagues. Ronald Reagan is In ornce, Ed 
Asner is in hiding and If you're like me , you 're 
wondenng, "What's gOing on here T' 

Is there really a conservative revolution underw'1Y on 
college campuses. as opinion polls done by the 
Washington Post Wahly, the ational OpinIOn Research 
Center and the Amencan Council on Education hal'e 
indicated? 

The Guardian sard yes lor UCSD on April 2. when 
the results 01 a student survey were headlined, "New 
poll indicates conservative trend." 

Conservatism is not easily definable. An error in 
surveying campus opinion is ohen made by comparing 
today's political climate against that of the Vietnam 
War em, without mentiOning the changes our society 
has undergone since . In 1965. Blacks w(' re still denied 
admiSSion to many Universities. abortion was Illegal 
and children were bemg led In prayer In the public 
schools. Now the whole context of what it means to be 
a conservative has 10 be redefined. To know where 
students stand politically today, it is nO[ enough to ask 
If they are Iibcml or conservative. Where they stand on 
political Issues IS what counts. 

The most Visible manifestations of conservatism at 
UCSD (conservatives being only those indiViduals and 
groups who identify themselves as such' are the 
College Republicans at UCSD, a campus group 
claiming membership of nearly one hundred, and the 
Cabjorrua Rcvrcw a traditional, controversial newspaper 
run by students. 

Shamus Brown. founder and recently resigned 
preSident of tht College Republicans at UCSD 
(CRUCSD) reclined on an art-deco sola in his Mission 
Beach apartment. He said that he reSigned hiS position 
because of problems in keeping up wnh his school . 
work, but new president LaUri Shirck mdicated the 
members of CRUCSD's board had threatened him with 
Impeachment If he did not. "A personal problem ... he 
was like a dicIJllor," she said. 

Brown seemed quiet and shy - hardly dictaLOrial 
- when ht' spoke with me. '" saw a lack of any type 
of organilation for people with conservative views to 
get involved with ," he said as an explanation of why 
he started the group . "What' like about conservatism 
is the economic viewpoints. Free market economy, no 
trade restrictions, letti ng things run themselves and lall 
into their natural place." 

He and Shirck have no love lost for each other but 
interestingly enough, their brands of conservatism are 
closely related. "I'm for almost all of the Republican 

CERVECEPIA "OCTEZU'" S , 

Party's pia dorms except for abortion ," she Said , 
echo 109 what Brown hau told me earlIer. 

Many studrO[s who call themselves tonservatives say 
thc)' do so on the basis 01 economic policy - they 
would Ii kc to see less government interference -

drugs ,md sex. Shirck estimates that 50% of rhe 
members of CRUCSD arc 10 d isagreement with thc 
PreSident's stands on some or all of those SOCial Issues. 

One excepuon to the economic mnservallsm so 
ollen mentioned b}' students is Bru e Williams, a 
JUnior al Warren College. CRUCSD's membership 
chalrmdn and only Black member. 

"I consider myself part of the ew Right ," he said. 
"My politics are m line with people like Jesse Heims , 
Ronald Reagan and Jlck Kemp. I'm more a social 
conse rvative than an economic conservauve." Williams' 
self-identifi auon as bemg a SOCial conservative was 
unusual: he was the only person Interviewed who 
made that claim. 

What makes WillIams ddferent IS the religiOUS 
motivation behmd hiS poliucal views. The majority of 
students who said they were conservative disavowed 
religion as being a factor in their political orientation. 

The appointment 01 Sandra Day O'Conne r to the 
upreme Court marked a dark day lor WHiiams, ", 01 

because she's a woman. but because of her record on 
abortion ItOO liberal ]." He says that education should 
be left up to the pnvate sectOr. But ideology 
notWithstanding, he does accept financial aid to go to 
school. "I gladly take lederal money with the thought 
in mind that I'm going to pay it back. I will pay back 
every cent they've given me." 

The essence of his polilical philosophy came OUt as 
he answered a question about prayer 10 the pubhc 
schools: "As a Christian nation we need to set aside 
and put in the minds of our young people that we 
should always set aside time to pray. Prayer is the key 
to the kingdom. 1 don't mean to imply that Chnstians 
are so great, 1 just feel that the country has been made 
by Christians." 

Enc Young is the driVing force behind the CalifornIa 
ReView, the conservative newspaper denied funding by 
the AsSOCiated Students last year following an uproar 
over an article they ran about the barroom rape in New 
Bedford. The ReView has contmued to publish without 
a campus subSidy, by soliciting donations lrom 
individuals and organizations in accord with its 
political hne, subscription money and advertiSing sales. 

Withol,lI hiS California good looks, bleached blond 
hair and tan, Young would seem qUite out of place at 
UCSD. His clothing - preppie with an occasional suit 
and tie - and speech - quotations and historical

"I'm basically apolilical ," he said, responding to my 
question about his poli tical affiliarion. "I'm a registered 
independent bur I've done some work for the 
Republican Party. 1 don't rhink that party politiCS is the 
mode though . I have sights on the system rather than 
against it." 

Once started, Young quickly got on a roll. "I worked 
my way through pnvate school with scholarships and 
the same with college. 1 see my adversaries Icode for 
KSDT and /ICW indicator members, he later admitted I as 
commg from wealthy homes in West Los Angeles. 
They're not taking very demanding courses at school 
and they're bored. They're not learning about a lot of 
things, like the oppression of the Jews for thousands of 
years." 

Young usually manages to mention something to do 
with Jews or being JeWish. It is a manipulative 
technique for winning favor that was clearly evident on 
rhe evening of the AS Council hearing about funding 
the Review. His entourage on that fateful occasion

Commuters! Arc you tired of waiting for 
twenty minutes for a parking place , being 
late to classes. parking o n Torrey Pines 
Road o nly to have your car vandalized or 
stolcn? If you would I,k" to know what's 

bei n~ done abou t the problem, or would 
like to voice your complatnts, conw to the 
commut"r lounge Wednesday, April 25th 
at noon to henr a srcakcr Irom the parkmg 
otflC", 

Provost's 
Corner 

l'w asked for this corner of Rewllutlons 
to keep you .ldviscd of new developments 
as se"n by me as your Actin!! Provost . Let 
me first state that any Revelle student who 
wants to talk with me, to complain o r 
whatever, is free to do so, I have drop-in 
office hours, Fridays 3 :30 .... :30 pm, o r you 
can make an appointment if that time is not 
possible, by just contacting my secretary, 
Joan Sheridan (x3262). 

Elsewhere on this page is an article about 
Parents' Weekend, May 5 and 6. [ hope 
you'll encourage your parent( 5) to attend 
and/ or come yourself to the seminara. The 
morning _ion on biotechnology and the 
afternoon one on preventina nuclear war 
both seem very appropriate for a student 
with a Revelle background, 

You may have heard that the Faculty 
Committee on Educational Policy (CEP) 
has recommended minimum breadth 
requirements for the entire campus. 
Although this will have no effect on Revelle 
which exceeds their limits. if it is adopted, 
certain other colleges will have to increase 
their breadth requirements to the point 
where at least eleven courses are separate 
from the major , Ln my opinion this can only 
improve the overall reputation of the 
campus and the value of your degree whicli, 
while from Revelle, is also (rom UCSD. 
Changes in the other college writing 
programs are also under consideration, [n 
general , the trend is toward programs of 
the, type and quality already tn existance in 
Revelle, In part, this reflects continued 
feedback from our al umni in all fields that 
in retrospect the humanities and writing 
sequence is that whICh has prawn most 
valuable in their careers , 

Starting this quarter , those of you who 
make the Provost's Honors List in our 
challenging curriculum will receive a 
ce rtificate so indicating your 
accomplishment, Stop by the Provost 's 
Office if it hasn't arrived by about the 7th 
we"k, Later this quarter we'll also have a 
banquet fo r our [UP 100 students, thanks 
to the generOSity of some Revelle parents, 

As you arc al ready aware, n"xt year on-
campus apartments w,1l be available for 
Revelle students and each college will have 

It.~ own residence facilities , Demand Will 
till exceed supply so that the Dean und I 

will conti nut.' to work for marc housin!:, In 
the meantime if you' re on the waiting hst 
keep tn tou h with the ReSident Dean s 
oltK" becaus" openin!!s will . urely occur 
dur inl! the summer, 

Finully . FrlJay of next week (April 27 ), 
Revelle will host the foreign studl,nt 
lunch,'on at the International Center, This 
is an Inexpensive (50~) lunch for ALL 
stuJents, desillned to p romote intera tlon 
between domestic and fo reign students , 
Eve ry one ' 5 Invited and I hope a lot of you 
will come. The multi-cultural aspe t of our 
campus IS a valuable one that I encourage 
you to benefit from, 

Tom Bond

Health Tips 
by Annette Dale, 
Student Health Advocate 

As you put o n your new SWimsuit and get 
ready to soak up that "wonderful " 
sunshme, you should ask yourself whether 
your tan toJay IS worth tomorrow's 
damaged skin, or the threat of skin cancer, 

ure, It'S harJ to deprtve yourself of the 
raging Southcrn Califorma sun, but you 
must f>e awnr" of the hdrmful effects of too 
much sun, 
What can too much sun lead to! 
• Sunburn 
• Prem.turdy .ged .km 
• ' k 111 Cancer 
How do r check for .kin canceT! 
Only a phYSICian can determine If you have skin 
'an~cr, «ut there are VI ,ble w"rmng S'!(flS you 
lim look for: 
• A sore that docsn [ heal 
• Chanl,:es to the I:e 0[ ,olor ot wart> or mol" 
• D.:wlopment or an unusual pigmented arca 
What ('an I do to minimite flu> . un'. hannful 
effects! 
• Apply sunsaccns 45 minuteS Prlo[ ro 
cxposur~ 

• Reapply sunscreens after sWlmmtng or 
pcrspltlng, 
• Make sure your sunscreen containS PABA. 
• AVOId exposure cxceedtng 15 minutes between 
lOam &. 3pm when the sun's rays are strongest, 
• Use sunblock ("e. ,inc oXide) 111 cKtra sensitive 
areas like the nose and lips, 
• Keep aCllve in the sun, Rays penetrate 
ImmobIle targets eas.er. 
• Don 't be fooled by cloudy days, 7()"80% of the 
sun's ultraviolet rays still penetrate cloudy and 
overcasr sk,es, 
• Be extra-<:autious in high altitudes: there's less 
atmosphere to filt"r out harmful rays, Also note: 
snow can reflect up to 85% of the rays. 
• Don't UK IW\ reflectors, for they expose 
delicate areas, 
• Don't use the need of vitamin D as an excuse. A 
well-balanced diet providrs sufficient amounts, 
For more information, free pamphlets, and

To Tell the Truth, I just don't know ... 
By PHIL LAUDER 
"Number one, what is your name 
ple,lse1" "My name is the San 
Diego Cli ppers." "Number twO -
what is your name please]" "My 
name is the San Diego Chppers." 
"Number three - what IS your 
name please?" 
"My name IS the San Diego 
Clippers." 
'Wlll the real San Diego Clippers 
please stand up?" 

The Clippers have sat down 
for the '83-'84 season, a 
sc hizophrenic bunch crying, 
·Wait tiU next season" yet one 
more season. This was a gro up 
that started its campaign toward 
respectability with a last 3-1, 
division-leading start. then faded 
fast, senling quickly and quietly 
into the Paciftc Division cellar 
lor the 53rd straigh t year. At 
times they were great, as In their 
late-season upsets of Boston and 
LA, .md at times they stunk like 
old Adldas, as In most of their 
club-record 36 road losses. 

DespIte the long-range shoOllng oj 
Norm Nixon and the inside power 0)' .. 

Saturday's fina l L-+6-128 defeat 
01 Utah at the Sports Arena 
brought San Diego its modest, 
second-half goal 01 30 victories. 
The Win kept the Clips out 01 
dead last in the Western 
Conference (where Houston has 
been lodged the last two yea rs). 
The win set some Indlvtdual and 
team records. But above all else , 
the win reminded one of what 
could have been: '83-'84 could 
have been a good - not great. 
just good - season lor SO. 
Instead, it was an up-and-down 
year of lrustration. 

First the good news: the dub 
improved. Alter going 17-65 and 
25-57 in the twO seasons 
previous, the team was 30-52 
thIS season. From 17-25 to 30 
WinS IS almos t a linear 
progressIOn; one would hke to 

become parabolk . or perhaps 
exponential. 

In the se;lson finale. S.1n 
Dlego's H6-point outburst set ;l 
dub reco rd against the Midwest 
DiviSion-leading Jazz. Norm 

Nixon provided the leadership, but 
if not for the courage of the fearless ... 

Nlxun 's 1c assIsts tied him lor 
the sC.lson BA mark at «') L4 . 
pUlling hlln into J thi rd -pl.ICe tic 
(wllh DetrOit's Isiah Thom.ls) lor 
the ail-time se;lson assist mark. 
Other individual 
accomplishmcnts olflciahzed In 
the linal comest were those 01 
Terry Cummings (nimh In 
scoring. 22.9 ppg). James 
Donaldson (second in field goal 
shooting. 5«,)%) and Ricky Pierce 
(hhh in free throw shooting, 
86%). 

Other good news induded a 
winning record at home (25- L6) 
anu. In the linal twO months, the 
dIscovery uf the best starting nve 
In club history. 

And now the bad news. The 
bau news IS that there's plenty 01 
bad news. 

The team has no bench

BUD LIGHT 
BEER FOR BEGINNERS 

UCSD ATHLETE OF THE MONTH 

Bob Natal 

Freshman Catcher / 
Outfielder 

Men's Baseball Team 

It's rare when a first yea r performer fresh out of high school has any kind of a 
significant impact on a collegiate athletic team, but those rare time do happen and 
UCSO's Men's Baseball Coach Lyle Yates is thanking the Big Triton in the Sky every 
time his ball players take the field these days. 

Bob ate I. UCSO's freshman slugging sensation. literally to re up the Southland last 
March with a prodigious display of hitting and power that has Coach Yates drooling 
at the thoughl of 3Y2 more yea rs with Natal on hi s team. 

The 5-10/ 195 pou nder from Chula Vista's Hilltop High School. had a tremendous 
month that paced the Tritons to 13 wins in March .. . the most ever in UCSO baseball 
history for anyone month . Natal. who splits catching and righ tfield duties with 
another freshman slugger Oerek Alkonis. had 30 hits in 80 trips (.375 average) with 22 
runs scored. 6 doubles. I triple. fo ur roundtrippers and 17 RBI's during a most 
productive month . And just last week. his tremendou game-winning grand lam 
homer lifted Ihe Tritons to an importanl league win over cross-town rival Point Lorna 
College. 

With two weeks still to go in the 1984 campaign. atal has already etched his name 
into the Triton record book with 8 homeruns. 34 ribbies ... both new UC 0 baseball 
sta ndards. 

As they say on the tube ... when you say Bud (or Bob) you've aid il all

Winter Quarter Results 
Thi' article is for the winners uf th 

Winter ~uarter 'port '. One of the most 
often heard complaint · of 1M Champs IS 
the fact that they don't get recogntzed 
properly in print. All quarter long yours 
truly churns out Bud Page after Bud Page 
extolling how great everyone i '. Interest 
IS keen. The bUIld up goes all the way up to 
the playoffs and creates a high Intensity 
level. Teams are '0 psyched up it's 
unbelievable. Then depression set in. 
You've just won the champIOnship that 
you knew you'd Win all a lung, but there 
are no more Guardialls coming out 
because of finals. What an Inju "lice! No 
way to build that ego up more. Nu way to 
prove that you won. No article to send to 
mom.

Softball Preview 

At last It '· here, softball !>cason . Oh 
have I been wailing for thIS. I"he annual 
riles of Spnng are upon us. I'm obviously 
not the only one who enjoys softball 
sea ·on. It seems that about 3,000 
students, faculty and ·taff at UCSU do. 
That'· 300 teams worth, or 100 more 
teams than the next biggest sport at 
UC U, Basketball. I guess you can 
attribute it to the fact that it IS just plain 
kick back fun. No bone jarring blocks. No 
slamma In your facea. just settle back, 
pop a Bud and enjoy. 

It 's a little early to come out and make 
my predictions but then I've never been 
shy to look into my crystal ball and let you 
all know who the winner will be. You 
know I'm rarely wrong. 

In Men's AAA It looks like a repeat of 
last year. The Brutal Puppydogs and Get-
A-Grip as the favorites. This does look like 
a tough year though in AAA. A lot of 
balance down the line. Look for the 
J<ectamatics, despite a early season nuke 
los ', and the Profoathletics to challenge. 

Men's AA should be a runaway with 
AAA Sandbaggers Cox taking it all. They 
have it all. 

In Men's A it looks like a wide open race 
for the rings. This division is always one 
kick away (rom the champion. The 
favorites in the clubhouse are the 
Illegitimate Fathers and Uestined to be 
Urine. Seems like an interesting pair up. 

In Coed AA which I call the boring 
division, it will be Shawn's O.R. Gang 
again. Too much talent here. 

In Coed A even I don't have a clue. Heck, 
there are L"l.4 teams alone in thi . division. 
That's more than 10 most of our other 
program .I call this a u-pick 'em dIvision. 

rhe Women's diVision is always a 
lightly contested race to the pennant. Last 
year's champs, The Soft Brawlers are 
finally gone. But there is stili plenty of 
talent. Butts To You won it two years ago 
and they look as good as ever. Brown 
Sugar, U-Street Band, the Biohazards and 
the Flying Fangs should provide the 
competition. 

Good luck to all of you. May every hit be 
a base hit!

MUlllelaDS III Academia 

By [TIIM r[[RST 
They had just Ingested mass 

quantities of recreational 
chemicals. Tim Root and Rich 
I'Ilchos of BOB, and Marc Dally 
and Roddy Bogawa of The Odds 
went to Mandeville under-
ground. In the music room. 
tha'c were way few convention-
al Instnllnaa - jUlt I pllno 
and some vibes. Molt of tile 
room was populated with 
various ...... toys" - hollow 
tubel. pots IIICI pans. !licks of 
VMous IengtIIs. As they eMered 
the room, all fell silent. nm 
turned 011' the lights. 

1'WtJty minutes lata' they 
hlcln1 spoken a word to t.ICh 
other. The group just made 
!OUIICIs of any character for tM 
gerry-rlgged casaette n:contlng 
sy!lcm set up: no tonality. no 
rhythm. just noise. Incked, this 
abstract jam was often a 
sidelight for these aspiring 
rock-and-rollers. But after 
participating In It, one !DOn 
realizes that these guys were 
artists who loved air vibrations 
of a range between 20 and 
20.000 Hz. They were In love 
wtth sound. period. 

This particular jam session 
prccedcd the last gig of the now 
defunct. four-member BOB 
consisting of keyboardist Tim 
Root, guitarist Rich Michos, 
&assist l'Iark Sell and graduate 
percussionist John flood, Root 
and Mlchos continue the newer 
BOB prqject with Root playing 
keyboards and Michos on guitar 
synthesizer. 

Between 606's concert last 
June 10 and the more recent 
Tuesday afternoon gigs at the 
Che cafe, B06 has completely 
abandoned its innuences from 
progressive bands of the '70s 
such as lUng Crimson and 
Genesis, The reason for the 
change, says Root, is that he 
kept growing out of his musical 
tastes. "Two years ago I thought. 
'How can you go more outside 
than Peter Gabriel?' The biggest 
thing I grew out of was trying to 
make rock and roll too serious 
with these big, overblown 

compositions," he commented, 
rderrlng to his older originals 
such as the frenetic "R1DT 
Meltdown," or tM ten-plus 
minute, continually evolving 
"Oliver." 

Ustenlng to a recent (he c.te 
recording of "Allan," an 
example of the IJOUP's trend 
towards ambient music - Root 
descrtbecl what he calls "nolle 
composltJons. .. "we want to add 
to tile environment. not control 
It. When a truck drives by, It 
becomes just IS 
much I part of the 
piece. At the point I 
am with sound. eway 
sound I hear Is 
music." According to 
partner Rich 1'I1chos. 
"We don't even ha~ 
to participate with 
the 'muslc' that's 
going on around us 
to erioy it, but If we 
do. that's great" 

Although Root has 
played keyboards 
since age three. he 
expressed frustration 
with both elecbonlc 
music. his main 
medium. and more 
conventional modes 
of composition, "I 
find the orchestll.ln 
particular, to be a bit of a 
dinosaur, musically. But tM 
problem I'm finding with 
keyboards is that It's a very 
'pitch' instrument. and I'm not 
really into pitch right now. I'd 
rather listen to a blender." 

As music majors, Both Root 
and Mlchos see a dichotomy In 
music between fun and 
thinking. As a release, they both 
enjoy Involvement with more 
conventional prqjects. Root had 
already been playing trombone 
with UCSO's flaming Hibachis 
when 60B splintered last year. 
Mlchos, who formerly pla~ 
with UCSO's Damaged Goods, 
later formed TwIn txperience 
with some off-campus 
collaborators. "We're all doing 
it for the money, but we have a 

blast on stage:' says Mlchos. 
Intellectually, says I'Ilchos, 

most pop music doesn't engage 
him. "If I look to Michael 
Jackson on intelectual terms, 
he's completely boring, 
fverything in pop Is centered on 
sex and gratlncatlon. It's 
disgusting. But if I go to a club 
to dance and eqfoy myself -
have a couple of beers - at that 
point, fudl being intellectual, 
I'm not there to judge:' 

Twin fIperIence's repatolre 

stems from such pop/funk 
artists as Stephanie Mills and 
Rufus and Chaka Khan as well as 
Talking Heads and the Pollee. 
Mlchos' goal with the band is, 
'1ust to play the stuff as 
perfectly as I can play it. [yen if 
it's an easy pop tune, you can 
always play It better." 

Root is Involved with the 
Hibachis for similar reasons, 
both for money and for the 
enjoyment of playing live, 
"DefInitely, the show comes 
ahead of the music we play. It Is 
a good release for me. It's not a 
heavily structured gig. It can be 
a lot of fun," Ultimately, as a 
performer he thinks "rock is 
great" but as a composer It 
doesn't interest him. Root also 
noted that the avant-garde in 

music has always been absorbed 
by pop at a fairly consistent 
rate, 

Looking ahead, Root is 
interested In developing what 
he calls "a newer art form. It 
would be neither dance nor 
music, but a combination," He 
described a performance what. 
somehow. a dancer dynamically 
causes the musk by braking 
light beams or being hooked up 
with wiring.

both of whom are 
music majors. Is

WI, a communJca-
tions/ v isua I arts

Despite his other interests, 
music is Bogawa's main goal. 
Working with bassist l'Iarc Dally 
(UCSD senior) and drummer 
Larry SWeeney (graduate), The 
Odds managed to record a 
single which was recently 
released. The words and music 
of both songs on the single, 
"World Crisis" and "No Time for 
the Dreamwo~ld," were written 
by Hogawa. 

Both Bogawa and Dally are 
concerned with the possibility 
of making political statements 
with pop music. Unlike the 
members of B06, who take a 
very formal approach to 
composing, The Odds are 

interested in starting with 
content and working towards 
form using pop as a medium, 
"You shouldn't get up every day 
and not question what you're 
doing," says Bogawa, who 
believes pop music can force 
peop~ to make a decision about 
what their values are. 

6ecause of the group's 
concern for cortent, BogIwa 
feels frustrated by live 
situations around UCSD. 
"People don't get this," M says. 
pointing to the lyric shed for 
their new single. "And we don·t 
want to be wallpaper or 
background music for some 
drunk's party. We want to see a 
reaction, We get just as much 
satisfaction out of seeing 
people leave a gig as we do If 
they stay." 

But if The Odds seek to 
confront and question 
audiences with their blistering. 
post-punk sounds in songs like 
"World CrIsis." "/'fa Time for the 
Dreamworld" and "Top to 
Bottom," they have also 
questioned themselves in a 
newer original. "Dance." Says 
Bogawa. "It's about taking 
yourself too seriously and 
thlnIdng you can change the 
world through pop music." 

Does he think pop music can 
change the world? 

"It's changed my perception 
of reality, so why can't it change 
everybody's?" Jokingly, he 
added, "If we want to be bigger 
than the BeaUes, does that 
mean we want to be bigger than 
God?" But he stressed, "It's not 
about spending your life trying 
to become an Idol. It's about 
communicating your own 
feelings. That's what that dark 
room in Mandeville was all 
about." 

for all these musicians. 
school remains a central 
concern. "If the chance comes 
through and we get a break., 
that's great," says Bogawa. "But 
we're not waiting for it or 
counting on it. That's why we're

Two weeks ago the San Diego 
Symphony played a program of 
Rossini, Haydn. Elgar and Karel 
Husa. The Rossini, Siege of 
Corinth. galloped along with 
the usual mindless but 
enjoyable energy. like a dog 
chasing cats and not knowing 
what to do with them when he 

' gets them. Serious musicians 
frown paternally on our 
predilection for Rossini. but 
they continue to play him. and if 
we ever saw the conductor's face 
I think it would be smiling. if 
only in the knowledge that the 
exercise he is getting is staving 
off hardening of the arteries for 
a few more years.

But I have forgotten to 
mention the duty of the 
audience. The Civic Theater 
seems to be heated for the 
benefit of the stalls. where the 
amount of fur makes it 
unnecessary, and in the 
mezannine and balcony the heat 
becomes oppressive. If not

excuse for the old gentlemen 
dreaming dreams in the

the children are another matter.

in a courteous and civilized

little darkened room. to save 
myself embarrassment. the 

world aggravation. and the 
children their lives. 

The difference between the 
conceptions of the young lady 
and the small boy were 
admirably illustrated at this 
concert, The young lady sat in 
front of me. her hat firmly on her 
head. quietly fanning herself. 
and trying very hard to be 
attentive to the music. 

The small boy beside me 
spent the "Enigma" variations 
ripping his programme up and 
making paper airplanes out of 
it. He doubtless would have 
thrown them over the edge had 
he not perceived. cleverly. by 
that time that I should have 
hurled him over also. and 
probably not have been 
prosecuted. His brother's 
creative energies expressed 
themselves in his running up 
and down the aisle. The father 
and mother remained 
impassive. no doubt used to this 
sort of thing and thinking the 
audience would become so In

have torn their last paper

-"ruck off and die" Music and 
lyrics by Bernard Yin 

As one of the founding 
members of the flaming 
Hibachis. guitarist Bernard Yin 
was with them until late last 
spring quarter. Although stili 
friendly with the group. he quit 
because he felt that there was 
not enough serious commit-
ment In the band to warrant his 
efforts. "It got to a point where 
[the other guitarist) was more 
worried about the groupies than 

the band. A lot of bands are 
together for the flash. the girls. 
the glory. the drugs. I suppose 
I'm In It for that too. but I'm also 
trying to satisfy a spiritual need 
- I'm trying to be moral. to a 
certain extent. in my music." 

He also expressed frustra-
tions with bands that play music 
with which they really don't 
have a connection. Reflecting 
on his experience with the 
Hibachis. he stressed. " I haven't 
been in riots in Belfast. We're 
sitting up there dressed in OP's 
and garbage bags. How can I 
play something like U2's 
·Sunday. Bloody Sunday'? 

Since his departure from the 
Hibachis. Yin joined with some 
students from SOSU jlnd Mesa 
junior COllege as part of the 
C3pulettes (as in Montegues 
and ). Hut recently he has 
become dissatisfied with this 
collaboration. "They wanted me 
to change the lyrics to 'fuck off 
and die: At first I did it. But then 
I couldn·t. I was seiling out." 

for Bernard. these lyrics 
express disillusionment with 
the rock music industry In 
general. "Popular groups. and 
most club and bar bands 
especially. are put together as 
more of a company than 
something that's culturally 
significant. They're like clones 
who look like Duran Duran and 
are good enough to copy the 
stuff. I want to be recognized for 
being myself:'

Goldie Hawn (the perennial 

"dumb blonde") and Kurt 
Russell head a troupe of 
talented performers In Swing 
Shift. a patchy portrait of 
working women. mlddle-dass 
ideals and romantic relation-
ships during World War II. 

Hawn plays Kay Walsh. an 
average Los Angeles housewife. 
whose husband enters the Navy 
just after the Invasion of Pearl 
Harbor. To support herself In his 
absence. Kay takes a job as a 
riveter in an aircraft factory -
to the dismay of many male 
workers. who feel the women are 

"lnvadlng their line of work. 
In time. Kay makes two vital 

friends: Hazel lanussi (Christine 
Lehti). a co-worker and 
neighbor: and " Locky" Lockhart 
(Russell). her foreman and 
eventual lover. Everything goes 
well for the three - until Kay's 
husband returns and the other 
two take a fancy to one another.

PEACE 
CORPS 

Special Work 
For Special People 

Peace Corps volunteers are 
people pretty much like yucl. Pe~ 
pie with commitment and skills who 
have assessed their lives and decided 
they want to be of service to-others 
in a troubled world, 

The problems our volunteers 
deal with overseas aren't new. Such 
as the cycle of poverty that traps one 
generation after another because 
they're too busy holding on to get 
ahead. The debilitating effects of 
malnutrition, disease, and inade-
quate shelter. Education and skill 
that are lacking, and the means to 
get them too. 

Your college training qualifies 
you to handle morc of these prob-
lems than you might think . Such as 
teaching nutrition and health prac-
tices; designing and building bridges 
and irrigation sys tems; working on 
reforestation and fi s her ie~ pro-

grams; introducing better agricul-
tural techniques; advising small 
businesses and establishing coopera-
tives; or teaching math and science 
at the secondary level. 

The number of jobs to do is 
nearly as great as the number of vol-
unteers who have served since 1961 : 
Nearly 90,000. More volunteers are 
being chosen now for tw~year 
assignments beginning in the next 
3-12 months in Africa. Asia, Latin 
America, and the Pacific. 

Our representatives will be 
pleased to discuss the opportunities 
with you.
