AS. ELECTIONS 2005 

Candidates square off 
Hopefuls offer plans at two debates 

By CHARLES NGUYEN 
Staff Writer 

Students competing for AS. 
offices squared off against one 
another in two debates that at 
times included hostile exchanges 
and allegations of deceit. 

Stretched over two debates in 
twO consecutive days, candidates 
answered questions about campus 
policies and laid out their person-
al plans, if elected. The first 
debate aired on Student-Run 
Television on March 29, and 
included all executive office candi-
dates. The next day, a separate 
Price Center contest featured A,S. 
presidential candidates and also 
touched on two referenda includ-
ed on the ballot. 

The questions gave much atten-
tion to the practicality of AS. slate 
platforms and statements offered by 
the competitors. A.S. presidential 
candidate Daniel Watts' Sun God 
Party has built its campaign around 
establishing a second Sun God fes-
tival, a message that was echoed 
during the debates. 

Anna MacMurdo/Guordian 
Face-off: AS. Elections Manager Steve York (left) mediated a debate induding 
Revolution! slate's Kevin Hanson (center) and Sun God Party's Daniel Watts (right). 

"We represent all students 
because we have a platform all stu-
dents can get behind," Watts said 
during the presidential debates. 
"Who doesn't want two Sun God 
festivals?" 

Watts said he plans to pay for 
the event by cutting multiple funds 
from the Associated Students, 
including stipends and travel bud-

gets.With the aid of sponsorship 
money that Watts accused the AS. 
Council of dragging its feet in pur-
suing, raising student fees to pay 
for a second Sun God festival is 
possible, he said. 

However, the slate's opponents 
called the plan unfeasible.

Senate votes to 
reverse some cuts 
Pell Grant would jump 
to $4,500 under plan 
By CHllmNE CLARK 

Staff Writer 

In a close vote, the U.S. Senate 
has passed an amendment to the 
2006 fiscal year budget resolution 
that would reverse many of the 
higher education cuts sought by 
President George W. Bush next 
year. The approved plan would 
also increase the maximum Pell 
Grant award from $4,050 to 
$4,500 and restore the Perkins 
Loan program, which the Bush 
administration proposed eliminat-
ing. 

In comparison, Bush's proposal 
would have increased the top Pell 
Grant by $100 this year and to 
$4,550 over the next five years. 
The amendment, which increases 
funding in the education portion of 
the budget resolution, was intro-
duced by Sen. Edward Kennedy 
(D-Mass.). 

U.S. Student Association 

President Ajita Talwalker said that 
the increased grant size and 
restoration of the Perkins Loans, 
which financially needy students 
receive directly from universi ties, 
are essential to funding education. 

"I think the amendment was a 
tremendous step toward improving 
education," Talwalker said. 

The House of Representatives 
has passed its own version of the 
budget. Both the House and 
Senate resolutions include ele-
ments of the Bush administration's 
plans to reduce government subsi-
dies to banks that provide student 
loans. 

However, the House version of 
the bill directs leaders on the 
Education and Workforce 
Committee to eliminate the 
Perkins Loan program, according 
to Angela Cuke, a spokeswoman 
for the committee.

'Atkinson' backed as 
name for new college 

Groups protest ntle IX advisory 

By WlLUAM CHING 
Staff Writer 

Sixth College'may soon receive a 
name change, losing its numerical 
designation to honor former UCSD 
Chancellor and UC President 
Richard C. Atkinson if the new name 
is approved by Chancellor Marye 
Anne Fox and the UC Board of 
Regents. 

Atkinson remains the primary 
candidate in naming Sixth College 
because he "has made fundamental 
contributions and serves as a model 
for the kind of continuing educa-
tion ideals that the sixth college 
strives to foster," the Sixth College 
Web site stated. 

The Sixth College Executive 
Committee released its preliminary 
recommendations for the new col-
lege name, backing Atkinson. The 
committee is currently in the process 
of consultation and no final recom-
mendation has been made, according 
to associate history professor and 
committee chair John Marino. 

Marino, a member of the Sixth 
College faculty, stated in an e-mail 
that the committee is "extremely 
excited" about the possibility of 
naming the college after Atkinson.

ments of Atkinson here at UCSD 
and at [the University of

'Clarification' would allow use of surveys 
By MARGin GONZAW 

Senior Staff Writer 
A national women's advocacy 

group and the NCAA have 
denounced a new Department of 
Education advisory that will make 
it easier for universities to demon-
strate compliance with federal 
gender-equity protections in col-
lege sports. 

The guidance allows the use of 
electronic surveys by university 
administrators to confirm that a 
school is providing enough pro-
grams to satisfy the interests and 
abilities of its female students, 
according to the Education 
Department. 

Known as "TItle IX," current 
federal statutes provide schools 
three options for demonstrating 
the absence of discrimination in 
sports programs: malcing availabili-
ty of varsity sports programs pro-
portional to the overall ratio of 
men and women attending a col-
lege campus, showing a progres-
sive increase of women's athletic 
opportunities through the creation 
of sports teams and showing that 
the interests of underrepresented 
minorities are being met. Schools 
who cannot prove their compli-
ance with at least one of the crite-
ria risk losing government funding. 

saly Wong/Guardian 
CuM Nil: For female players like those on UCSD's softball team, the new Title IX 
surveys could threaten three decades of gender-equity progress, the NCAA warned. 

In years past, some schools 
have attempted to justify a lower 
number of women's varsity teams 
by using the last option through 
surveys that showed a lack of 
interest in additional sports teams 
on the part of women. Many of 
them, however, have been the tar-
get of lawsuits, so proportionality 
was the only safe option to 
demonstrate compliance with 
TItle IX, according to College 
Sports Council spokesman Jim 
McCarthy. The group represents 

a national coalition of coaches, 
parents and student athletes. 

Ths, however, has led Ill1iversi-
ties to reduce the number of men's 
sports in order to satisfy the quota 
for proportional men\; and women\; 
teams, McCarthy said. In the 1970s, 
the law's authors envisioned that it 
would instead lead the number of 
female teams to increase. 

"Virtually every school has cut 
men's teams or placed an artificial

Budget: Amendment tops 
Bush's education bottom line 

continued from page I 
"The House leaves those 

[funding] decisions to the 
Education and Workforce 
Committee," Cuke said. "But the 
Perkins Loans are a special case. 
It is a very small percentage of 
overall loans, and it is underper-
forming. Other loans are more 
efficient, so the bill suggests that 
they would have funding priori-
ty," 

However, Talwalker said she 
supports the Senate's proposal to 
restore the Perkins Loan funding. 

"I think [cutting the Perkins 
Loan] is problematic," Talwalker 
said. "A minuscule increase to the 
Pell Grant while simultaneously 
reducing student loans will make 
higher education inaccessible to 
studellts. " 

The Senate budget resolution 
indudes a series of proposals made 
by the Student Aid Alliance, a 
coalition of several higher educa-
tion group>. Those proposals 
include reversing the Bush admin-
istration's proposed cuts to out-
reach programs and increasing 
funding to graduate education 
programs and work study. 

The $5.4 billion Senate bud-
get resolution will be paid for by 
closing several corporate tax 
loopholes, Kennedy said. 

"Reversing President Bush's 
tax cuts will fund the bill," 
Kennedy'S spokeswoman Melissa 
Wagoner said. 

However, Senator Judd Gregg 
(R-N.H.), who debated against 
Kennedy's amendment on the 
Senate floor and who serves as 
the chairman of the Senate's 
Budget Committee, said he was 
concerned over the COSt of the 
ch.anges. 

"Senator Gregg doesn't sup-
port the amendment because it 
could cost taxpayers $5.4 billion," 
said Cara Duckworgh, a spokes-

woman for the Republican 
majority on the committee. "He 
doesn't believe in increasing taxes 
to increase spending." 

Kennedy's education amend-
ment would also decrease the 
$4.3 billion Pell Grant shortfall . 
The deficit has been caused by a 
larger-than-expected number of 
qualified applicants applying for 
the aid program in recent years. 
Because it is an "entitlement pro-
gram," the government must cur-
rently provide aid to all appli-
cants who meet set criteria, even 
if the number surpasses the bud-
geted levels approved by 
Congress. 

"I am pleased by my amend-
ment's passage and the signal it 
sends that this Senate can come 
together and restore Bush's edu-
cation budget cuts so that stu-
dents can compete in the global 
economy," Kennedy stated in a 
press release. 

The congressional budget res-
olution provides an outline for 
lawmakers to pass the federal 
budget but does not necessarily 
reflect how the final spending 
plan will look. If approved, the 
plan will go into effect for the 
2006 fiscal year, which begins in 
July. 

When Congress reconvenes 
next week after a two-week 
spring recess, a conference com-
mittee between members of the 
House and Senate will attempt 
to reconcile differences in the 
twO versions of the budget reso-
lution. The committee will 
decide whether the final version 
will include Kennedy'S amend-
ment.

Study may lead to 
better autism diagnosis 

Information about an individual's 
mirror neurons - which are thought to 
be involved in the execution of move-
ments based on observations and also 
in higher cognitive thought - may allow 
doctors to make earlier diagnoses of 

••• 

autism and find new therapies, UCSD 
researchers predict in a new study. 

In a report to be published in the 
journal Cognitive Brain Research, the 
researchers present electroen-
cephal~raph readings from 10 autis-
tic individuals that they believe link 
dysfunctional mirror neuron systems 
to disorders that cause autism. The 
EEGs suggest that these brain circuits 
do not function normally in autistic 
people. 

Because autism is characterized, 
in part, by a lack of social interactions 
and communication based on leam-
ing through imitation, previous 
research has speculated that mirror 
neurons may explain the abnormal 
manifestations of the ·disorders. The 
new findings, researchers stated, sup-
port this hypothesis. 

College degree nearly 
doubfes annual salary 

College graduates bring in almost 
twice as much money as workers 
with only a high school diploma, 
new educational attainment data 
from the u.s. Census Bureau shows. 

On average, degree holders make 
$51,206 per year, compared to 
$27,915 for high school graduates, 
the agency found . Workers with 
advanced degrees make an average 
of $74,602 while high school 
dropouts average $18,734. 

Though women continue to grad-
uate from hi~ school at slightly high-
er rates, a higher proportion of men 
receive at least a bachelor's degree, 
according to the data. For both gen-
ders, fewer than a third of individuals 
graduate from college. 

Student debt burden 
flat, despite more loans 

Though a combination of rising 
tuition and increased limits in the fed-
eral student loan program has caused 
"dramatic" increases in borrowing by 
college students, more loans have not 
translated into a higher debt burden 
for graduates over the past decade, 
the Department of Education 
National Center for Education 
Statistics has reported. 

Sixty-five percent of college stu-
dents borrowed to finance their edu-
cation in 1999-2000, compared to 
49 percent eight years earlier, and 
took out an average amount of 
$19,300, or $7,000 more than they 
did in 1992-93, NCES data show. 

However, lower interest rates and 
higher salaries have allowed the per-
centage of the monthly paycheck 
committed to debt repayment to 
remain largely flat.

THURSDAY, MARCH 31 , 2005 THE UCSD GUARDIAN NEW 

Debates: Contenders disagree over feasibility of second Sun God funding 
conrinued from page I 

Revolution! slate commissioner of 
programming candidate Eric Morris 
said that the $88,000 budgeted for a 
second Sun God festival does not 
cover production costs, let alone 
booking costs for acts. 

liThe money needed for a sec-
ond festival is nonexistent," he said. 
"The two Sun God thing is a lor of 
hype. I'm not against a second Sun 
God, but I'm against the way [the 
Sun God Party) is doing it; it's not 
something you can do with just 
shifting money around." 

Morris also said that much of 
the money in Watts' budget 
assumes large and unlikely corpo-
rate sponsorships. 

However, Morris' opponent on 
the Sun God Party slate, Tammie 
Nguyen, countered that, while cor-
porate sponsorship would h.elp the 
festival budget considerably, it was 
not required. 

"According to our budget, a sec-
ond SUll God is feasible," Nguyen 
sa id. "It's not something impossible 
to do. The $88,000 we propose in 
our budget for a second Sun God is 
a smaller amount in case we get no 
corporate sponsorship. But we can 
get it - its not impossible to do." 

Watts said a smaller festival , 
which his slate dubbed "Son of Sun 
God," will not cost as much as the 
current festival, but will still be 
"FallFest times 10." 

Independent presidential candi-
date Keshav "Kiki" Boddula advo-
cated the possibility of another festi-
val, as long as it aligned with finan-
cial realities and students' desires. 

Student Empowerment! presi-
dential candidate Christopher 
Sweeten said he supported using any 
potential funds for a second Sun God 
on student organizations instead. 

An extra Sun God aside, candi-
dates had much to say on issues 
ranging from campus controversies 
to national politics. 

The matter of meal point usage 
was debated between Revolution! 
slate's Angela Chen and Sun God 
Party's Tali Shousterman, both can-
didates for commissioner of enter-
prise operations. 

"I'm in support of re-establishing 
the use of meal points for Grove 
Caffe and other AS. enterprises," 
Shousterman said. "I look at this 
position as CEO of 'A.S. business.' 
We need to show administration that 
even though we are students, we are 
professional. We need to change the 
way we tallc to administration." 

Chen, who worked in the enter-
prises office for the past year, con-
tended that this was a year of recon-
struction. She added that AS nego-
tiations are under way with Director 
of Housing and Dining Services 
Mark P. Cunningham concerning 
the expansion of meal point plans. 

Shousterman proposed bringing 
a gourmet ice cream cart to UCSD, 
which Chen called "procedurally 
impossible." 

"I'm not going to promise any-
thing that can't be done," Chen said. 

Viability was again a theme in 
the debates for vice president of 
finance between Sun God Party's 
Erik Ward and Revolution' candi-
date Greg Murphy. Cutting A.S. 
stipends would not only allow for 
the "Son of Sun God," but also 
more money for student athletics 
and organizations, Ward said. 

However, Murphy was skeptical 
of the plans. 

"I believe that saying it's going 
to happen is not reality," Murphy 
said. "It relies a lot on corporate 
sponsorships. " 

Ward responded that regardless 
of sponsorships, all areas of his 
slate's budget are realistic. 

Revolution! members also ques-
tioned if the Sun God Party's budget 
could be passed at all, since the slate 
has five senatorial candidates on the 
ballot, who would sit on a 24-senator 

council. Budget approval requires a 
majority vote by the A.S. Council. 

"The budget won't get passed 
even if all [Sun God Party) senators 
are elected," Revolution! presiden-
tial candidate Kevin Hanson said. 
"Five of 24 votes are not even near 
a majority." 

Watts pointed out that current 
A.S. President Jenn Pae ran as an 
independent, which allotted her no 
initial senatorial support. Even 
then, Pae was able to pass her bud-
get, Watts said. In addition, the 
Sun God Party is gathering support 
outside of its slate by endorsing 
other candidates, he said. 

Expressing a cQncern echoed by 
many campus cultural organiza-
tions, candidates for the commis-
sioner of diversity affairs debated 
ideas to increase diversity on a 
campus that contains a student 
population that is less than I per-
cent African American. 

"It's a socioeconomic issue," Sun 
God Party candidate Parris Bass said. 
"One in 200 students come from 
underrepresented schools." 

Bass suggested strengthening 
th.e University of California's 
Eligibility in Local Context pro-
gram, which guarantees admission 
to any students within the top 4 
percent of their high school class. 
Yee Lee from Revolution! slate and 
Eiko Arseniak of the Student 
Empowerment! slate advocated 
outreach to increase diversity. 

"It means a lot to high school 
kids to come out and experience 
what college is like," Arseniak said. 
"Programs like [the Office of 
Academic Support and 
Instructional Services] and the 
Preuss School are great. With pro-
grams like those, students have the 
ability to gain further access to aca-
demics." 

Candidates also debated student 
access to campus government, 
which some contenders said h.as 

Anna MacMJroo/GuarcJian 
Race: Independent candidate Keshav 'KilO' Boddula was indifferent to the AS. structure 
referendum supported by Student Empowerment! candidate Christopher Sweeten. 
been lacking in the past years. 

Revolution ! vice president 
internal candidate Angela Fornero 
suggested that proper organization 
of A.S. meetings would maximize 
student involvement and interest. 

"The [vice president) internal is 
the one that sets the tone for entire 
meetings," sh.e said. "Council cau-
cuses and presentations need to be 
regulated or be submitted earlier." 

Fornero's opponent, Wayne 
Klitofsky of the Sun God Party 
slate, said that communication with 
students is key to making senators 
accountable to their positions. 

"We need to give students rea-
son to show up at A.S. meetings," 
he said. "Every student needs to 
know there [are] public input ses-
sions. We need to reach out 
through [Student Organization and. 
Leadership Opportunities) and 
[residential advisors) to let students 
know that A.S. represents you. It's a 
matter of accountability." 

A referendum on next week's 
ballot will attempt to solve the mat-
ter of accountability by reforming 
the A.S. Council's structure. The 
referendum met both acceptance 
and neutrality during the A.S. pres-

idential debates. 
If passed, the referendum would 

cut the amount of college senators 
in half, while adding six generally 
elected campuswide senators. 
Having campuswide senators would 
allow for a more accurate represen-
tation of students, Sweeten said. 

Boddula said that while students 
don't identify with one of UCSD's 
six colleges, he would like to see 
them do so. He added, however, 
that he is lukewarm on the referen-
dum and needs more information 
before taking a permanent stance. 

Watts, however, urged students 
to vote either way on the subject. 

"If you identify more with your 
college, vote no and if you don'r,

LAO recommendation 
a student opportunity 

T hough the general theme of the recent budget study from 
the Legislative Analyst's 
Office may not be gooa -
urging less money for 
Califorrua universities and 
slower enrollment growth 
- students shoula think 
twice about discarding the 
entire document. In partic-
ular, another little-noticed 
recommendation may offer 
students some much-wel-
comed protection from 
future twtion hikes. 

That recommendation 
would require lawmakers to 
subtract the amount of 
money UC and CSU cam-
p'uses raise in new fees from 
the annual growth in state 
funding promised in the 
governor s compact. For 
example, though Gov. 
Arnord Schwarzenegger has 
promised the UC system 3 
percent more funas next 
year, the LAO has suggest-
ed that this 3 percent 
should also include new 
money the university will 
receive through fee hIkes, 

In the short run, this will 
likely mean less money 

from the state. However, 
students need also consider 
the remruning years of the 
compact. Starttng- in 2007 
and continuing for the fol-
lowing three years, the 
compact promises the uni-
versIty 5-percent annual 
funding growth while leav-
ing fee lUkes to the discre-
tion of the UC Board of 

Reg~nts . 
Under the current sys-

tem( this means the regents 
cou d jack up fees anytime 
they need more cash, 
However, the LAO's plan 
would essentially remove 
all incentive for the regents 
to raise tuition, because the 
new proceeds would have 
to be subtracted from the 
guarantee in state funding 
growth. And if more fees do 
not translate into more 
money, why would the 
re~nts bother with them? 

Though the UC 
Students Associa tion has 
criticized other portions of 
the LAO's analysis, it 
should certainly embrace 
this recommenoation and 
protect the UC campuses 
from higher tuition. 

Surveys unfair way to 
comply with Title IX 

W hile the Department of Education's recent efforts to 
better define Title IX com-
pliance standards should be 
applauded, the office's quiet 
refease this month of a new 
regulatory "clarification" for 
interpretmg the important 
statute booes ill for women's 
athletics at universmes 
nationwide. The move, 
which has drawn quick criti-
cism from women's advoca-
cy groups and the NCAA., 
allows colleges receiving 
federal funding to use 
online surveys ~and online 
surveys only - to gauge 
whether women's athletics 
programs "fully and effec-
tively" meet the needs of 

fem~le srudents, one 
regwrement for a universi-
ty's compliance with the 
1972 genaer equity law, 

No matter the accuracy 
of the intended survey; the 
dep'artment's new ~i~ance 
makes opting out of either 
of the other two ways a uni-
versity can comply - by 

matching the proportion of 
female athletes WIth that of 
female students enrolled, or 
by showing an expansion in 
women's Spo~l?I:ograms­
far too easy. While surveys 
are one way to prove ample 
accommodation of current 
or future female athletes, 
others already in practice, 
like soliciting input from 
coaches and admmistrators 
in area high schools and city 
leagues, are equally, if not 
more, valuable. 

Indeed, universlttes 
intimidated by the stamte's 
vagaries should have a 
clearly defined opportunity 
to prove that theIr institu-
tion is meeting the interests 
of its female students if 
such is the case. However, a 
poll administered bye-mail 
that regards nonresponses 
as a laCK of interest is inap-
propriate Jind dangerously 
problemanc, as any smdent 
who promptly deletes all 
inbox correspondence from 
the univerSIty could con-
tend.

Beware of the false promises put 
forth during A.S. Council elections 

By BRIAN UIGA 
Senior Staff Writer 

Politicians and bullshit are as 
American as apple pie. From the 
national level to the state level to 
the city level, every election is full 
of bluster over "hot-ticket" issues 
where often directly opposing 
"facts " are spun into oblivion to 
invoke an emotional response. 
The upcoming A.S. Council elec-
tions are no exception, and so far, 
this year's flock of candidates 
looks to represent business as 
usual, with the same election-time 
promises and issues being dusted 
off and put on display. 

One of the most contested 
issues this year, and every year, is 
the diversity of UCSD's popula-
tion. On the one hand, UCSD has 
some of the most active and effec-
tive student programs in the UC 
system and the nation in terms of 
diversity awareness and cultural 
celebration, which keeps UCSD 
visible in the eyes of like-minded 
groups worldwide. However, in 
terms of actual admissions, 
UCSD is doing a rotten job of 
admitting a representative popu-
lation of students. In terms of 
admission, the ever-present cry 
against "white male privilege" has 
some basis. 

In terms of student programs, . 
ASUCSD can do quite a bit, and 
has traditionally done a good and 
thorough job in the past, But at 
the heart of the matter of admis-

sions, Associated Students is 
impotent. The highly contested 
(and quite expensive) high school 
conferences ASUCSD currently 
provides for increased diversity 
have had a small effect, but for the 
most part, aU ASUCSD can do is 
lobby university administrators, 
who have a track record of being 
about as effective as someone try-
ing to injure Arnold 
Schwarzenegger by throwing 
pennies at his head. And any 
politician who says otherwise is 
lying through hi s or her teeth . 

An issue which should not be, 
but always is inextricably linked to 
diversity, is free speech - a topic 
that has been forced into the spot-
light recently by pornographic 
events shown on SRTY. Unlike 
admissions, ASUCSD can actually 
control its student-funded media 
outlets and has proven itself by 
doing so in the past. When deal-
ing with offerings from the Koala 
or SRTV that push the envelope, 
ASUCSD is prevented by nation-
al law from restricting funding 
based on content, but usually 
finds some excuse to do just that 
under some other auspices. This 
year's A.S. Council did an ade-
quate but unpopular job of deal-
ing with the "free speech" issue of 
"Koala TV" by removing the 
"free speech" portion of its com-
plaint and telling SRTV to do 
what it said because A.S. Council 
was the one holding the checks. 
It's useful to remember that any 

time a politician says 'Tm for free 
speech, but ..... they're not for free 
speech. And any politician who 
says otherwise is lying through his 
or her teeth. 

Those issues aside, all of the 
other hot topics in the upcoming 
election amount to student pref-
erence over how to balance 
ASUCSD's $2 million budget. 
Every politician under the sun will 
state a desire to take money away 
from "elite groups" and give that 
money to "services which benefit 
all UCSD students," but usually 
this is politician code for taking 
money away from student pro-
grams they personally don't use 
and giving it to student programs 
they do use. If money was actually 
allocated based on how many stu-
dents use a particular program, 
ASUCSD would exclusively fund 
concerts, the more popular publi -
cations and OAS.I.S. Obviously 
some degree of balance is needed 
to give other underrepresented 
programs a chance, but this is by 
definition a purely selfish and 
political decision, so beware of 
any hack politicians who say 
they'll increase funding to pro-
grams that benefit "the people," 
or "all of UCSD," because they 
simply will not. t\nd any politician 
who says otherwise is, again, lying 
through hi s or her teeth. In fact , 
in this time of budget crises, 
informed voters should question

Promises: Council's power 
lies in balancing their budget 

UCSD Master Plan out of step with our 
Southern California location 

continued from page 4 
exactly what programs get cut to 
fund any extravagant campaign 
promises. 

Apart from balancing its budget, 
ASUCSD has no actual power. 
Nowhere is this issue more preva-
lent than on the single issue all 
UCSD students can agree on, that 
of par1cing. 

Every year for the past 10 years, 
UCSD's student politicians have 
promised better parking for stu-
dents, and they have never, ever 
delivered. More than anything, 
this is due to the fact that the aver-
age UCSD student has unreason-
able expectations about par1cing. 
Let's face it, every student wants to 
pull onto campus five minutes 
before class and walk right into a 
classroom, but unless you park on 

~le sidewalk or ride a motorcycle, 
this is as unattainable as increasing 
student diversity through 
ASUCSD lobbying. 

UCSD parking is not required 
to, has not, will not, and never will 
answer to any student or student 
group. An advisory board on park-
ing issues exists, and it is responsi-
ble for some small changes made in 
the past, but UCSD will never 
have affordable and convenient 
parking unless a large wave 

destroys the foundations of every 
building and the reconstruction 
effort includes underground park-
ing. And any politician who says 
otherwise is lying through his or 
her teeth . 

So where does that leave A.S. 
Council as a whole? It can balance 
a budget with its own money and 
give it to student programs it 
likes, and it is a somewhat effec-
tive lobbyist when working on 
student-controlled campus issues, 
like the recent success with 
renewing the co-op lease agree-
ments. Given this modest power, 
Associated Students has always, 
and will always, attract the next 
generation of politicians who are 
eager to change the world while 
filling their resumes. To accom-
plish this, they will lie or mislead 
voters on any subject necessary to 
get them into office. 

But let us not blame or resent 
them for their election-time bull-
shit; let us instead celebrate their 
patriotism for carrying on this 
important American tradition . 
After all, the optimism that creates 
all of these false election promises 
is actually responsible for most of 
what's great about the student pro-
grams at UCSD.

to make the next leap; Thoughts 
change us biochemically. 

The first time that the enor-
mous power of thought came to 
the foreground of my attention 
was when I was presented with the 
following experiment in a cogni-
tive science class ; Researchers 
sounded a bell and immediately 
injected a dog with acetylcholine. 
As a response to acetylcholine, the 
dog's blood pressure would lower. 
Experimenters did this until the 
dogs were trained and knew what 
to expect from the bell. Then, the 
experimenters switched sub-
stances, and after sounding the 
bell, injected the dogs with adren-
aline - which normally causes 
high blood pressure. But the dogs 
were expecting acetylcholine, and 
their blood pressure lowered, even 
with an adrenaline injection! The 
pharmacological effect of adrena-
line was annulled by the power of 
expectation alone. More recent 
experiments corroborate the bio-
chemical nature of expectations. 

I was floored. From the lack of 
excitement from my classmates, I 
surmised that everyone was either 
smarter than me and thought the 
power of thought was old hat, or 
they were hedging their bets that 
this was not going to be on the

final - and thus was boring. To 
me, the skeptic, tha t was enough to 
establish that thoughts are power-
ful. Physically significant, even. 

But that only set off a chain of 
related thoughts: Which is ea sier, 
changing our expectations or the 
world around us? What kinds of 
expectations do happy people 
have? How many conflicts are a 
result of mismatched expectations? 

A lot, I would wager. When 
expectations don't match, some 
people persuade each other into 
changing opinions, and some stan 
crusades. Some end up dying of 
anorexia. To simply expect people 
to snap out of anorexia, alco-
holism or depression is to trivial -
ize the matter and underestimate 
the physical power of thought. 

For a less morose, more local 
example, there seems to be a great 
discrepancy between student's 
expectations of parking and 
administrators' . When I bought a 
$477 yearly "S" parking permit, I 
didn't expect to be buying an 
expensive chllnce to park. When I 
rent an aparnnent, I expect it to 
come with a parking space reason-
ably near my door, but this isn 't 
always the case on campus. 
Because I attend a university in 
Southern California, the land of 
highways from whence drive-
thro ughs sprung into exis tence 
and conquered the world, I expect 
to need a car. 

If YO li look at the Master Plan 
for thi university inside its gin 
case in Urey H all , you'll notice 
there are 12 college projected, 
but not much parking . The 
designers expected a thriVing 
campus community where you 
could wal k everywhere. The trou-
ble is, what do I do when I'm 
stranded car-less and need a hair-
cut, or need to deliver proofs to a 
printer in EI Cajon ' San Diego is 
not New York, nor Boston. It 
probably never will be. T he pop-
ulation density just isn 't the same, 
and the cabbies aren't swarming. 
The public transportation system 
here JUSt isn 't comprehensive 
enough to transport people in a 
reasonable amount of time. 

While the parking committees 
fight for rows of parking spOts 
when unprofitable parking lots 
get paved over to ma ke way for 
the new seventh coll ege, it is 
worth asking, is the Master Plan 
out of step with UCSD'~ 
Southern Californi a loca tion' 
Can we change it? If we can't 
change our collective expectation 
of how this campus should grow, 
then what can we do to change 
the world around us - the public 
transportation system, the city 
density or the retail spaces avail -
able to students' Any kind of 
examination is welcomed; we can-
not afford to ignore this discrep-
ancy in expectations. Letting the 
campus expand without parking, 
or changing our environment, is 
simply an invitation for trouble. 

T he only thing worse tha n 
mismatch ed expectations is leav-
ing them unresolved. 1~ime goes 
on phlegmatica lly, mechanically, 
and our predictions of the future 
are either affi rmed or frustrated. 
T his can result in joy, satisfaction, 
disappointment, a riot, divorce, a 
traffic ticket or wet feet . It is 
worth giving some thought to the 
role that expectations play in our 
lives and confl icts. If your profe~­
sor expects you to read mllch 
more than YOll think you can, or if 
your significant other expects you 
to act in a different way than you 
think you sho uld , maybe you 
should expl ore what you ca n do to 
resolve the discrepancy in expec-
tations. It won't be easy, but there 
is some satisfaction in taking con-
trol of one's life. 

So, does your mother know 
you're a bookie?

limit on the men's roster to malce propor-
tionality fit," McCarthy said. "It's totally 
unfair; reform has been needed for a long 
time!t 

The elimination of men's "nonrevenue" 
sports teams that bring in little money for 
campuses, such as wrestling and swimming, 
in order to prove gender equity has also had 
a negative effect on female athletes in the 
form of lost training parmers, McCarthy 
said. 

"In cases like Olympic sports, the men 
and women train together," McCarthy said. 
"If you cut the men's team, the women's 
team loses its training parmer, which often 
helps the athletes when they train with men. 
Men and women should be teammates in 
sports, not adversaries competi ng for the 
same spot on the field." 

On March 17, the Education 
Department offered additional details clari-
fying how surveys can be implemented to 
allow schools to prove the interest criteria of 
Title IX, providing a model survey that 
"gives schools one new tool for accurately 
and comprehensively assessing the athletic 
interests of their students," Education 
Department DirectOr of Public Affairs Chad 
Co!by said . 

Because schools now have an officially 
sanctioned model to use when measuring 
students' athletic interests, the surveys will 
be given greater weight in assessing compli-
ance with Title IX, according to Colby. 
Used in conjunction with other factors, a 
survey showing that few female students 
want to compete in sportS would allow 
schools to offer fewer women's teams than 
they provide for their male counterparts, 
without risking the loss of federal funding. 

However, the National Women's Law 
Center has expressed concern over how 
accurately surveys can measure the interests 
of the female student body, warning that the 
change could be a way for schools to escape 
their obligations to provide equal opportu-
nities for women and men. 

"This is simply an underhanded way to 
weaken Title IX and make it easy for schools 
that aren't interested in providing equal 
opportunity for women to skirt the law," 
NWLC Co-President Marcia D. 
Greenberger stated in the group's press 
release. 

The NCAA shares the same concerns 
over the methodology of an e-mail survey 
providing an adequate representation of the 
interest at the schools, according to NCAA 
Managing Director of Public and Media 
Relations Bob Williams. 

Furthermore, the survey does not 
"encourage young women to participate - a 
failure that will likely stymie the growth of 
women's athletics and could reverse the 
progress made over the last three decades," 
NCAA President Myles Brand stated in a 
press release. 

Colby, however, defended the surveys 3S 
a method for a school to ensure equal 
opportunity for female athletes, rather than 
a way of bypassing that responsibility, by 
"fully and effectively accommodating the 
athletic interests and abilities of its female 
students," and possibly even creating new 
programs for women if the surveys show 
adequa te need and interest. 

"In many instances, it will identify the 
need to create a women's team where that 
need may not otherwise have been identi-
fied," Colby said. 

The survey will provide the most accu-
rate measure of the abilities and interests of 
the female students because it asks them 
directly what sports they want to participate 
in, rather than assuming the need for more 
women's tearns at the cost of unprofitable 
men's teams, McCarthy said. 

"What could be an easier, more straight-
forward way to find out which sports to have 
than to ask [the women] what sports they 
want to participate in?" McCarthy said. "To 
imply that women's sports will be discount-
ed is utterly ridiculous ." 

Critics of the new advisory have also 
been criticized for not soliciting public 
input on the new policy. Several years ago, 
the Bush administration faced stiff opposi-
tion from lawmakers when it suggested 
making similar changes, which were never 
enacted. 

However, Colby said the department did 
not need to follow the more cumbersome 
bureaucratic procedures usually required for 
regulatory changes because the new adviso-
ry is simply a "clarification" and does not 
change current legal compliance mandates .

California] arc in keeping with the goals 
and ideals of [Sixth] Colleges commionent to 
innovative education, [the] building of com-
mmuty and its interdisciplinary theme in cul-
ture, art and technology," Marino stated . 

However, some Sixth College students 
have criticized the naming process and the 
proposeu selection. 

Sixth College sophomore Mooneer 
Salem stated in an e-mail that he felt that 
"the process hould have been more open." 

"I ... feel Sixth should have let the stu-
dents know from the beginning that a name 
was actively being sought out and given 
them some say in the matter," Salem stated. 

Although UCSD and UC policies do not 
fom13JJy include students' input in the naming 
process, Sixth College S~dent Council Chair 
C. Dillon Marrin Hall stated in an e-mail that 
the administration has been open about the 
process. 

"I've found [the administration] to be 
strongly committed to the well-being of Sixth 
College and its students, and 1 haven't seen 
anything less in this whole process,~ he said. 

Sixth College Senior Senator Matt 
Corrales stated in an e-mail that although he 
admires Atkinson's commitment to cross-
curricular education and diversity, he still 
maintains that the committee has overlooked 
an opportunity to honor an individual who 
has contributed more to the enhancement of 
a historically oppressed communi ty. 

"As a strong proponent of diversity him-
self, I think Atkinson would appreciate nam-
ing a college after a person of color," he stat-
ed. "In addition, only one other college is 
named after a woman, which makes it 
extremely disappointing that Sixth may be 
named after another man. When students of 
color and queer students are fighting so hard 
to improve campus climate, it would be an 
insult to them to name another college after 
a straight white man." 

Marino stated that although some stu-
dents may be upset by the proposal, the 
committee believes that they will likely 
change their minds after learning more

In 200 I , Atki nson led the calls for

BLOC PARTY, 
" IN· "'U'~ .. 

Blo( Party 
Silent Alarm 

Dim Mak Records 

** Everyone: stop listening to the Killers. IUght now. Not because they're ter-
rible, wiUch they are, but 
because Bloc Party have 
out-KHlered the Killers in a 
way (hat makes the Killers 
utterly obsolete. Not that 
being better than the Killers 
is an amazing feat, mind 
you: The roster of the "bet-
ter- than-the-Killers" crowd 
boasts both talented groups, 
like Franz Ferdinand and 
Interpol, and not-50-great 
groups, like the Furureheads 
- even Bloc Party. In fact, 
of all the groups that are 

better than the Killers, Bloc 
Party are nigh on the worst, 
but they sound so much like 
the Killers that other band 
should be compared favor-
ably to them, and the KiJlers 
should go the way of 
Fastball. 

Feigning an arena-sized 
sound and U2's sense of 
grandness combined with 
danceable and urgent 
rhythms, Bloc Party's inven-
tiveness lies somewhere 
between Franz Ferdinand 
and absolute shit. They are 
relentlessly catchy, occasion-
aJly crappy and always con-
vinced of themselves, thun-
dering through angular gui-
tar lines and thumping bass 
that suggest they've listened 
to the legendary Gang of 
Four, but that they would 
rather get down to 
"Dancing Queen" than 
"Damaged Goods." 

Someone has to carry the 
Brit-pop torch, and unlike 
the Killers, who dabble in 
make-believe Britishness, 
Bloc Party are the real thing. 

The real thing is always 
preferred to the fake.

Da U.S. Open 
Thizz Entertainment 

*** 

Mac Ore, an original Bay Area rap pioneer, was tragically kjlled 
last year, and DI1 U.S. Open, 
with fellow Vallejo native 
Mac Mall, is iUs first posthu-
mous release. The two Macs 
assume the identities of 
Andre Macassi and Mall 
Macenroe on this unique 
and entertairung collabora-
tion. 

Much of this album 
sounds similar to Mac Ore's 
previous two releases, con-
taining either the light, 

funky guitar strumming of 
Runl1fd Oregan, or the hard, 
club-ready beats of The 
Gtrmt Is Thick. However, no 
matter the production, 
Macassi and Macenroe keep 
the content simple and fun-
loving with appealing hooks 
and game-soaked flow. On 
"Heat and Head," Ore floss-
es his firepower wiUle Mall 
focuses on fellatio, and 
"Giggin'" is Ore's follow-up 
to the "Thizzelle Dance," 
proclaiming that "this ain't 
no love ballad or romance 
song/ Ths a dance song for 
you to get your dance on." 
The duo feign their best 
Jamaican accents on "Murda 
I Wrote," one of the better 
songs on the album, and 
"Cuddies Say 'Yee'" has the 
potential to be a Bay Area 
anthem. 

Many find underground 
hip-hop abrasive, and this 
album won't change their 
mil\ds. But Mall and Ore are 
the cream of the Bay Area 
underground crop, and fans 
of Bay rap will appreciate 
what might be the last of 
Mac Dre's music.

The Songs of Junior 

Kimbrough 
V2 

*** Old bluesmen," the adage goes, "never die. They just have their 
songs rehashed by soul-
starved wiUte wiUppersnap-
pers." 

That statement applies 
[Q about half of Sunday 
Nights, a tribute to 
Mississippi boogie-blues 
medium Junior 
Ki!J!brough, whose death in 
1998 left more than a few 
indie-rockers without a 
father figure. You'll find 
some of the best (the Fiery 

Furnaces) and the worst 
(pete Yom) of them on 
Sunday Nights, trying their 
hand at Kimbroughs mys-
terious trance-blues [Q 
widely mixed results. 

White bluesmen fail for 
lack of either soul or style, 
and this tribute is almost a 
laundry list of reasons for 
why Caucasian fingers 
should never touch 12 bars 
again. Thee Shams, Whitey 
Kirst,jack Oblivian and the 
Ponys all poop out pasty, 
dull blues-rock that makes 
the second hal f of this 
album harder to get 
through than Clapton's '80s 
catalogue. 

It's the Black Keys (on 
the album's excellent first 
half) who really give 
Kimbrough - a longtime 
friend and mentor - iUs 
due. Dan Auerbach wails in 
the whiskey-est white-ma,n-
vocal not on a Tom Waits 
record. "Tell me, tell me 
what to do," he begs, over a 
tentative, rising swirl of 
tremolo and reverb - from 
the sound of it, he already 
knows.

rallied to tie the score at three 
apiece with two runs in the top of 
the seventh inning. 

Mer shuning down Cal State 
Bakersfield for the next three 
innings, Bryant gave up a leadoff 
home run in the bonom of the 
fourth. 

Anderson was the offensive 
hero for the Tritons in game two, 
with a two-run home run in the 
top of the seventh inning to tie 
the score at 3-3 . 

Anderson ended the game with 
an impressive line, going 2-for-3 
with a triple, the homer, two RBIs 
and two runs scored. 

Bryant toolt the loss for the 
Tritons while Ward recorded a no-
decision, allowing three runs on 
seven hits in seven innings. 

The Trirons swept Cal Stare San 
Bernardino in a March 12 double-
header, 2-0 and 7-2, respectively, to 
snap UCSD's four-game losing 
streak. 

Rowe pitched game one brilliant-
ly. She tossed a complete game 

shutout, allowing one hit, walking 
two and striking out four. 

In the leadoff spot, junior J elUlY 
Spencer went 2-for-3 with one run 
scored and one RBI, while fresh-
man infielder Danielle LuItJc also 
went 2-for-3 in the cleanup spot. 

Anderson collected the other hit 
for the Tritons, with an RBI double 
in the third inning. 

The Tritons shut down the 
Coyotes' anempt to recover the 
ground it lost in game one with 
another win in game two. 

Mer Cal State San Bernardino 
took an initial 1-0 advantage in the 
first inning of game two, UCSD 
responded in the bonom half of the 
inning with a suicide squeeze bunt 
by Hurst that scored Spencer. 

The Tritons culled siJ: runs in 
the second inning, as siJ: straight 
hits led to all six runs for UCSD. 

Anderson capped off the rally 
with a three-run home run. 

Ward picked up the win for 
UCSD, allowing two runs on five 
hits in her five-plus innings of 
work. 

Bryant tossed the final two 
innings, allowing no runs or hits 
while striking out two.

State San Bernardino, UCSD 
dropped its third and fourth con-
secutive games March 10, losing to 
Cal Baptist by scores of 2 -I and 4-
o in a doubleheader. 

Game one was a tightly contest-
ed pitcher's duel. Rowe took the 
loss for the Tritons in game one, 
despite allowing only two runs 
while scattering eight hits and 
striking out four. 

In game two, freshman Jenny 
Maze collected two of UCSD's four 
hits, while Spencer and Cope 
accounted for the others. Ward 
allowed four runs, two earned, on 
six hits and struck out two baners in 
five innings of worlt. 

The team will be bad in action

by Cal Stare Stanislaus in Modesto, 
Calif. UCSD will take on Seattle 
University and Western Oregon on 
April 1 to start the tournament. 

Kevin Beeman

Senior 
North Hollywood, CA 
The UC San Diego men's and 
women's track and field teams each 
won the UCSD Collegiate Open on 
Saturday as the men finished first 
out of 18 teams while the women 
had the best score of the 16 teams 

competing at the two day event held at the Triton Track and Field 
Stadium on the UCSD campus. 

Swim: Boehm crowned Swimmer of the Year 

The men made the biggest move of the day, rising from eighth 
place on day one to claim the victory. Senior Kevin Beeman was 
the highlight of the day for the men, setting a new school record 
while also meeting a NCAA provisional mali< with his best jump 
016'11·, 

continued from page I ~ 
fifth place. 

Collectively, the Tritons worked 
just as well in the relay events, 
securing first place in the 4OO-med-
ley relay, second in the 200 and 400 
freestyle races, and third in the 800 
free relay on March II. The 400 
medley team, made up of Delurgio, 
sophomore Susan Bell, senior 
Frances Tran and Harlan, raced to 
victory in 3:48.58, over Drury's 
relay, which followed by less than a 
second at 3:49.26. 

On the men's side, Boehm was 
the clear standout on the Triton

team after his unparalleled individ-
ual showings in the 200 individual 
medley, 200 freestyle and 200 but-
terfly and as a member of the sec-
ond-place 400 freestyle and medley 
relays. 

Boehm also worlted with seniors 
Michael Baier and Devin Spicer 
and sophomore Tim Fuller to set 
the record in the 800 free. 

"That was nice," McGihon said. 
"We were three seconds under the 
record and got a consistently 
strong race from everybody.· 

The backbone of the Tritons' 
scoring was in the rest of the team. 

All 13 swimmers on the men's team 
who were entered in the NCAA 
Championships scored points for 
their team, while II did so in indi-
vidual events.

Softball sweeps Coyotes 
Rowe pitches complete-game shutout 

By MICHAEL SCHOECK 
Senior Staff Writer 

The UCS D softball team 
played with mixed results in five 
doubleheaders from March 10 
through March 26, going 4-6 over-
all. 

The Tritons (11-12 overall , 8-7 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association) split a doubleheader 
against Sonoma State on March 26 
in Rohnert P,.ark, Calif. UCSD won 
game one by a 6-5 score before 
dropping the nightcap by the same 
score. 

From the top of the lineup in 
the first game, the Tritons began a 
barrage of hits that caught 
Sonoma off-guard. 

With two runs scored and one 
RBI, junior outfielder Jenny 
Spencer went 2-for-4, while junior 
shortstop Desiree Franciscus went 
3-for-3 with three RBIs. Senior 
catcher Jamie Hurst went l-for-2 
with a run scored and two RBIs, 
both of which came on her first 
home run of the season. 

Senior pitcher Kelley Bryant 
threw 2.2 innings of relief to pick 
up the win and improved to 3-2 for 
the season. Bryant struck out three 
and allowed only one run on three 
hits while walking two. Sophomore 
TIna Rowe, the starter, received a 
no decision for her 4.1 innings of 
work, in which she allowed four 
runs on eight hits. 

Despite being down two runs 
early in game two, Sonoma State 
regained lost ground against 
freshman pitcher Melissa Ward 
who all owed four runs, one 
earned, on four hits in 1.2 innings. 

GIeg O./Ciuorriion 
Ducks in I row: Sophomore Tina Rowe pitched a gem in a 2-D win against Cal 
State San Bernardino on March 12, snapping UCSD's four-game losing streak. 

Franciscus went 2-for-3 with 
an RBI, while Hurst, junior out-
fielder Niki Anderson and sopho-
more second baseman Dallas 
H ernandez each added one hit 
and one RBI. 

T he team split its conference 
doubleheader with San Francisco 
State on March 25, winning game 
one by a 4-2 score, halting the 
Gators' II -game winning streak. 
But the CCAA-Ieading San 
Francisco State came back and 
won the nightcap 5-0. 

In the opener, the Tritons 
scored first in the top of the third 
inning on an RBI double by 
Franciscus that scored Spencer. 

UCSD scored three more runs 
in the top of the fourth on senior 
outfielder Breanne Cope's three-
run home run to left field, her first 
of the season. 

Rowe picked up the win for the 
Tritons, going just over five 
innings, giving up five hits and 
two runs while striking out four 
and walking one. Bryant recorded 
her second save of the season, 
pitching the final 1.2 innings of 
scoreless relief. 

The March 22 doubleheader 
against Cal State Bakersfield was 
disappointing for the Tritons, who 
dropped both games with scores 
of 7-3 and 4-3. 

Rowe took the loss for UCSD 
in game one, allowing seven runs, 
only three of which were earned, 
on nine hits with no walks and 
three strikeouts in over five 
innings of work. 

The loss in game two was espe-
cially tough to take as the Tritons

Swimming comes up 
solid in championships 

By MATTHEW GRANT 
Sports Editor 

After combining to break a total 
of two NCAA Division II records 
and II UCSD school records -
while winning five events against 
premier national competition -
the UCSD men's and women's 
swimming and diving teams 
returned from the NCAA Division 
II Championships in Orlando, Fla., 
with third and fourth place awards, 
respectively. Senior Kurt Boehm 
was named NCAA Division II 
Swimmer of the Year following his 
winning performances in the 200-
yard individual medley, 200 
freestyle and 200 butterfly, plus a 
fourth-place finish in the 100 but-
terfly. His 200 individual medley 
time was a Division II record. On 
the women's side, senior Rosanna 
Delurgio led her team with an 
NCAA Division II record-setting 
200 breaststroke performance com-
plemented by her second-place fin -
ish in the 50 freestyle to edge 
sophomore teammate Emily 
Harlan in the event. 

"We expected the first part of 
[Delurgio's 200 breaststroke] to be 
long and relaxed and then to drop 
the hammer," head coach Scott 
McGihon said. "But it turns out 
that long and relaxed put her in the 
lead after the first 50 [yards]." 

Delurgio, Harlan, junior Sophie 
Levy and sophomore Andrea 
Lippin all broke chool records in 
their first events on March 9. In the 
50 freestyle, Delurgio and Harlan 
trailed Cal State Baxersfield's Loni 
Burton by more than half a.second, 
but battled intensely for second 
position. Harlan was touched out 

by 0.01 seconds to take third in the 
event. 

"I expected us to be two of the 
top four in the [women's 50-free], 
but it was nice to go two-three," 
McGihon said. 

Levy and Lippin pressed the 
race leaders in the 1000 freestyle, 
taking third and fifth places, 
respectively. Drury's Natalie 
Cardoza won the event in 10 min-
utes, 1.26 seconds, less than half a 
pool length in front of Levy, who 
earned a time of 10:08 .96, and 
Lippin, who finished at 10: 17.09. 

"It was expected that they would 
be under the record in the thou-
sand," McGihon said. "But it was a 
questioll." 

The women's team benefited 
from its consistency through the 
four-day meet, as it held firmly in 
third place behind Missouri power-
houses Truman State and Drury. 
T he Tritons ultimately tallied 406 
points behind Drury's 530 and 
Truman State's 579.5. 

Individually, constant strength 
of the Triton women was the decid-
ing factor in keeping UCSD in 
medal contention. Levy and Lippin 
carried their first-day success in the 
1000-freestyle over to March II 
and March 12 for the 500 and 1650 
freestyle events. In the 500, Levy 
turned in a fourth-place finish, 
coming in at 4:57.87 and leading 
Lippin, who finished at 5:01.0 I, by 
two spaces. In the final day of com-
petition, both women broke the 
former UCSD best mark in the 
1650 as Levy captured third place 
in 16:58.55 and Lippin followed 
her moments later in 17:06.8 for

No. 19 baseball sweeps Cal State Los Angeles 
By COURTNEY FIELD 

Senior Staff Writer 
After a mediocre mid-March 

schedule, the UCSD baseball team 
(16-8 overall, 11 -6 California 
Collegiate Athletic Association) 
stepped up its play March 25 and 
March 26 and swept Cal State Los 
Angeles (8- 12 overall, 5- 11 CCAA) 
in a three-game series in Los 
Angeles. The Tritons inched out 
the victory in game one with a 
score of 5-4 and proceeded to crush 
the Golden Eagles in both ends of 
the doubleheader, 21-10 and 8-0. 

Between March II and March 
23, UCSD posted an uncharacteris-
tic 3-4 record. The Tritons stole 
games one and three from Cal State 
San Bernardino (9-7 overall, 12-9 
CCAA) 13-12 on March II and 3-1 
on March 12, but dropped game two 
6-12 on March 12. In the ensuing 
series against Cal Poly Pomona (17-
12 overall, 15-7 CCAA) on March 
20 and March 21, it was just the 
opposite. UCSD dropped the book-
ends of the three-game series against 
the Broncos 7-3 and 7-0, but pre-
vented a series shutout by earning 
the victory in game two 7-3 . The 
Tritons then dropped their single-
game matchup at home against Cal 
State Dominguez Hills (11-17 over-
all, 6-14 CCM) on March 23 in a 
12-inning thriller, 4-3 . 

Heading into the series against 
Cal State Los Angeles on its first 
two-game losing streak in 2005 , 
UCSD battled and emerged victo-
rious in all three games against the 
Golden Eagles. The Tritons took 
two of three ga mes from Cal State 
Los Angeles in a series played ear-
lier this year. 

In the opener against the 

Golden Eagles, Triton junior out-
fielder Matt Lawson led off the top 
of the first in high fashion with a 
home run to right center field . 
UCSD senior shortstop Keith 
H ernandez then walked and 
sophomore catcher David 
Morehead singled, putting runners 
on the corners. Sophomore desig-
nated hitter Brian Trump hit an 
RBI sacrifice fly and senior second 
baseman Ricky Pinocchio singled 
in the inning, picking up another 
RBI to give the Tritons a 3-0 lead 
from the outset of the game. 

Cal State Los Angeles scored 
twice in the fourth and two more 
times in the sixth. At the end of six, 
the Golden Eagles led 4-3, but 
UCSD's tenacity never wavered. In 
the eighth, Lawson walked and stole 
second . UCSD senior outfielder 
Craig King singled, scoring Lawson 
on an error by the catcher. 
Hernandez was hit by a pitch and 
then King scored on a wild pitch and 
gave UCSD the 5-4 lead and ulti-
mately the win. 

The Tritons carried the 
momentum into the doubleheader 
on March 26. Four UCSD batters, 
Pinocchio, senior third baseman 
Alex Gascon, Lawson and senior 
catcher Matt Anderson, went yard 
in the first game of the double-
header. Hernandez went 5-for-7 
with five RBIs and senior designat-
ed hitter Joel Clarx went 5-for-6 
with three RBIs. The offensive 
attack, launched early in the second 
inning by Pinocchio's grand-slam 
home run, gave the Tritons resur-
gent energy as they pummeled the 
Golden Eagles, 21 - 10. 

Cal State Los Angeles chipped 
away at the Triton lead early in the 
game and took an 8-5 lead through 

four when Golden Eagle first base-
man Matt Winkleman returned the 
favor and smacked a grand slam of 
his own off of UCSD junior starter 
Jose Navarro. 

The Tritons battled back and 
regained the lead 9-8 in the fifth on 
Gascon's homer to center. Clark 
and Hernandez also pushed runs 
across. 

"There is so much to say about 
the seniors on this team," UCSD 
head coach Dan O'Brien said . 
"Alex [Gascon] is second in the 
conference in batting average and 
one of the best third basemen in 
the conference, if not the best. 
Keith [Hernandez] is a four-year 
starter and one of the most consis-
tent batters we have in our lineup, 
and Joel [Clark] has really stepped 
up for us and has filled in and per-
formed in crucial situations when 
we need him most." 

The Tritons posted another four-
run inning in the seventh with 
Lawson's two-run home run and 
Morehead 's RBI single. Leading 15-
10, the Tritons left nothing to 
chance with a big ninth inning. 

Anderson led off with a homer to 
left field, sophomore pinch hitter 
John Roth notched two RBIs on a 
fielder's choice and Gark had anoth-
er RBI single. Hernandez's fifth hit 
of the game was a double, ltnoclting 
in his fourth and fifth RBI of the 
game to give UCSD a cornfomble 
21 -10 lead. 

UCSD junior pitcher Matt 
Sweany (1-0) threw 4.1 innings of 
relief to earn the win. 

The nightc2p proved to be a con-
tinuation nf the Triton assault on Cal 
State Los Angeles. UCSD won 8-0 
behind the pitching of junior starter 
TC. Geach (1-0). Geach quieted the

giving up six hirs, no runs while 
striking out three. 

"TC. has worked hard to 
become one of our starters," 
O'Brien said. "His dedication to 
this team and to the game is evi-
dent when he takes the mound dur-
ing games and practices." 

In UCSD's half of the third 
inning, King walked and later scored 
on a Cal Stolte Los Angeles error fol -
lowing Triton senior centerfielder 
Brad Beltz's bunt single. Lawson had 

an RBI double and UCSD led 2-0 
after three. The Tritons scored sin-
gle runs in the fourth and fifth 
innings and added two more in each 
of the sixth and seventh innings to 
seal the third victory of the series. 

"This is a team whose best base-
ball is still ahead of them," O'Brien 
said. "We playa lot of baseball in 
April and May, and I'm looking 
forward to seeing them get into a 
late-season groove." 

UCSD is baclt in action at Triton 
Baseball Stadium in a four-game 
series on April I through April 3.

Campus Christian club 
given new S·RTV show 

College station must provide equal 
time under 'content neutrality' 

Ashlee Simpson to headline Sun God 
Gin Blossoms, Blackstreet also to perform 

By DOUCHE NOZZLE 
Senior Staff Writer 

In an attempt to comply with 
the "balance in broadcasting" reso-
lution adopted by the A.S. Council 
last month, Student-Run Television 
has announced plans for the cre-
ation of a new Christian-themed 
show to premiere this week. 

As part of a larger station over-
haul following the controversial 
porn airing by Koalo editor and 
A.S. Elections Manager Steve York, 
the council last month ordered all 
student-funded media to air "a full 
spectrum" of ideas and provide 
"equal time" for all sides of contro-
versial issues or face losing eligibil-
ity to receive A.S . funding. 

SRTV Station Manager 
Chelsea Welch downplayed the 
council's threat in the decision to 
create the new show. 

"This was a purely editorial 
decision based only on the best 
interest of our viewers," Welch 

said. "Some of our viewers want to 
see penetration, and other want 
consecrati on. As an A .. student 
service, we want to make sure that 
we meet the demand for both." 

Produced by Campus Crusade 
for Christ and titled "CCC-TV," 
the new show will be hosted by 
CCC principal member Manish 
Manim, who squared off against 
York on MS BC's "Connected: 
Coast to Coast" at the height of the 
porn controversy. 

"I knew I had a knack for televi-
sion when I did the show," Manim 
said. "SRTV was a natural venue to 
share that talent with my congrega-
tion." 

T he new show will include a 
variety of segments, including 
Oprah-style interviews, Manim 
said. So far, he has only finalized 
plans for the "What would Jesus 
do?" video advice column. In addi-
tion, the Career Services Center

Pop tart Ashlee Simpson will 
perform in the headlining slot at 
this year's Sun God festival, A.S. 
Programming Director Craig 
Schreiber announced yesterday. 

T he mes age, explaini ng that

binding her to perform at the May

Chipotle shut down in .ATF sting 
Agency alleges eatery served alcohol to minors 

By twlRY TWINKLE 
Contributing Writer 

Department of Alcohol, 
Tobacco and Firearms officials have 
decided to close down La Jolla's 
Chipotle restaw'ant after allega-
tions of a series of offenses, includ-
ing serving alcohol to minors. 

Representatives from Little 
Steps Christian Preschool have 
alleged that an unidentified pony-
tailed man served four rounds of 
margaritas to several five-year-
olds at the La Jolla Village Square 
restaurant, causing them to go 
into a drunken rage. 

"I puked balls for days," five-
year-old Mackenzie White said. "I 
am forever banished from the pearly 
gates of my Christian heaven." 

Some believe that this incident 
is just one of many crimes com-
mitted by Chipotle staff since 
1999, when the restaurant was 

opened on Villa La Jolla Drive. 
Complaints have included 
radioactive barbacoa, burrito-
bowl urination and several cases of 
senior-citizen genitalia-revelation. 

"Chipotle prides itself on 
serving a diverse consumer-
base," said Chipotle founder 
Steve Ells. "In La Jolla, this 
means serving toddlers with the 
same vigilance we serve college 
students, soccer moms and oth-
ers who choose to suckle on the 
sweet teat of the holy Chi pot-day 
before plundering the pagan 
haven of Golden Spoon." 

ATF spokesman Brad 
Hayward said the agency asked 
the federal court to strip the 
establishment of its operating 
license after its agents collected 
the first documented violations. 
The agents visited the restaurant 
during a sting operation designed 
to catch collectors of underage

A lawyer for the restaurant did 
not return calls seeking comment, 
though a statement from his office 
called the charges "false and pre-
posterous. " 

Preschool administrators said . 
the suspected violators would 
burn in hell for their sins, includ-
ing the most recent crimes. 

"This is as hot as it gets for us

Guardian editors vote 
for new pizza toppings 
Unprecedented 13-1 vote rocks 
senior staff, who threaten suit 

By SLOBODON BUSTY 
Senior Staff Writer 

Editors of the Guardian 
announced on March 3 1 that the 
newspaper's executive board, the 
body vested with its official gover-
nance, will no longer be purchasing 
garlic and tomato pizzas from 
Domino's for staff meetings. 

Staff members attending the 
weekly meetings will instead be 
treated to pepperoni and harn-and-
pineapple pies, according to Editor 
in Chief and Pizza Advisory Panel 
Chair Clayton Worfolk. 

"Garlic and tomato was really 
getting played out," Worfolk said. 
"There was really no question 
about it." 

The move comes less than a 
month after burglars ransacked the 
newspaper's offices, taking Hiatus 
Editor Ian Port's Club magazine 
"Best of" issue, as well as Features 
files documenting months of 
research into clubbing in Carlsbad. 

In addition, the hoodlums stole 
the editors' Domino~ gift certifi-
cates, according to Managing Editor 
Grant Schrader. 

"The fuckers took my red pens, 
too," Schrader said. 

It was the robbery that inspired 

PAP to make a change; however, 
the decision was met with far from 
unanimous consent. 

"In addition to being beneficial to 
the immune system, garlic is also 
effective in keeping the vampires 
away," Associate Hiatus Editor and 
former health columnist Neha Singh 
said. "Pepperoni, ham and pineapple 
have no such power." 

PAP even considered changing 
pizza providers, but the idea faced 
stiff opposition from a coalition of 
disgruntled staff members. 

"I can live with changed pizza 
toppings," Design Editor Andrew 
Nguyen said. "But, I refuse in the 
name of tradition to allow these 
power-sluts to unilaterally force their 
shiny pizza tastes upon me." 

In the interest of fairness, PAP 
sought the expertise of industry 
consultant Wolfgang 
Schlomokovonovich for help. 

"Topping choices are directly 
related to job productivity," 
Schlomokovonovich said. "By rid-
ding garlic from the pizza, they 
effectively removed the stink hover-
ing over the paper since the begin-
ning of the year."

Item F 
In a 1-2 vote, the council 

approved allocating $10,000 from 
Travel Unallocated to pay for trav-
el expenses of six A.s. executive 
officers attending the annual UC 
Students Association Convention 
on Student Solidarity. The con-
vention will take place over 
Memorial Day weekend at the 
Hilton hotel in Maui . 

The allocation included fund-

CORRECTIoNs 

ing for the presidential suite, five 
other rooms and luxury dining. 
Senators rejected supplementary 
funding proposals to pay for 
prostitutes because they violated 
article 2 of the A.S. financial 
bylaws. 

Council Caucus 
For twO hours, the council 

debated the bidding process to 
pick the company that will supply 
toilet paper to the new gender-
neutral bathrooms included in 
the designs for the expanded 
Price Center. In a nonbinding 
straw poll, the majority of coun-
cilmembers said they preferred 
softness over absorbency, which 
caused Revelle Senior Senator 
Ted McCombs to protest loudly 
and walk Out of the meeting. 

Because McCombs' departure 
meant the council no longer met 
quorum and could not discuss 
official business, A.S. President 
Jenn Pae asked A.S . 
Commissioner of 
Communications Hilary Elder to 
forcefully bring McCombs back 
into the meeting premises. 

Old Business 
The council accepted. without 

dissent, the recommendation of 
its internal committee to place on 
the spring ballot yet another ref-
erendum. 

The new ballot item will ask 
students to vote on whether to 
replace the A.S. Safe Rides service 
with a campus beer tank, to allow 
students to enjoy alcohol on cam-
pus and avoid driving while 
drunk.

Study: Wolverine shit 
secret to healthy skin 

Last month, scientists at the 
University of Michigan released the 
surprising results of their study on the 
wrinkle-reducing properties of wolver-
ine shit 

According to microbiology profes-
sor Will B. Schukendy~ wolverine 
feces containes the compound WFF 
(wolvofecalfacialene) that, when 
applied to the face and hands, shrinks 
the dead or dying skin cells in and 
around the wrinkled areas eventually 
causing them to reduce or disappear. 

Schukendyk stated that the 
University of Michigan will collaborate 
with a number of major skin care cor-
porations, including Oil of Olay and 
Nivea, to produce an "age-defying" 
cream containing WFF. 

The product will be aptly named 
"Excrecia" and should reach store 
shelves by fall 2006. 

U-House bought out by 
Interfratemity Couner 

In an attempt to secure needed 
fu~din~ to rebuild the crumblin~ 
Umversrty House - the official resI' 
dence of the chancellor - UCSD 
administrators have announced a joint 
financin~ agreement that will allovv the 
campus fratemities to use the resi-
dence as a recreational facility and first 
phase of a nelJy planned Greek hous-
ing project. 

In exchange, members of the 42 
campus fraternities have agreed to 
self-assess themselves an extra S4 
per quarter - a one-third retum-to-
aid will also go as a kickback to cam-
pus Financial Aid Director Vincent De 
Anda - to payoff a newly floated 
bond that will cover the cost of the 
rebuilding and De Anda's newly 

formed dru~ habit. 
"University House will become 

the center where even the State kids 
will want to party - a Mecca in the 
middle of the desert: Chancellor 
and new Little Sister of the Lambda 
Alpha Pi fratemity Marye Anne Fox 
said, as she partook in a beer bong. 
"I left condoms and lubrication in the 
night stand, I'ust in case." 

Previous y, Vice Chancellor of 
External Affairs James M. Langley 
failed to raise the $7.2 million in pri-
vate funds needed to rebuild the res-
idence. Despite the one-month 
fundraising extension provided by 
UC Office of the President and a last-
minute drive to shake down donors 
by offering them sexual favors with 
Universi ty Communications Office 
staff, Langley was unable to privately 
fund the project without Greek help. 

Campus administrators rejected 
Langley's other proposals, which 
included a brothel on the site of the 
original house or, altematively, con-
verting the seismically unsafe struc-
ture into permanent low-income bar-
racks br illegal immigrants and 
migrant workers. 

HDS announces Triton 
Plus expansion 

Housing and Dining Services

announced on March 29 the exten-
sion of the Triton Plus program to sev-
eral controversial off-campus estab-
lishments. 

Little Italy topless revue club Dirty 
Dan's Pure Platinum was among five

Cunningham, who expressed his

A ftrst-of-itr-ltin4 theory un love, 
writtm by John Muir CoIkge sopho-
mort Vladimir Koglin, WIIS published 
lim m(lmh in rhe jUUT1lllI The Anals of 
Human Sexuality. It is rtprinttd hert 
in part, with pmnissiun of tbt author: 

Our current system for the cre-
ation of relationships is flawed 
because it requires a level of consen-
SIIS by both members of a couple that 
is unattainable and insatiable. 
Consider, for example, how a normal 
relationship forms . 

Two people meet. They begin 
talking and soon realize they have 
much in common. 

At some point - an arbitrary 
point I will call the "love threshold" 
that is unregulated by the market 
mechanism and thus subject to indi-

vidual interpretation - the two 
decide that they have enough in 
common to carry out collective 
action: fonning a relationship . ... 

Specifically, consider the case of 
two young lovers in a relationship. 
Both assume that the cloning postu-
late holds. On a date, the two engage 
in physical contact and perhaps kiss 
- whether the tongue is used is not 

. relevant for the purpose of this paper. 
Now, what happens if the male 

actor begins to grope the female 

actor, whose preference is, in fact, 
not to be groped? Conflict serious 
enough to end a relationship. 

This happened, of course, 
because both actors possessed two 
different V21ue preferences that they 
acted on, a perverse set of conditions 
in which the rational pursuit of 
action maximizing personal prefer-
ences leads to irrational group pref-
erence, where collective action cann-

Simpson who would agree to 
refrain from profanity during the 
concert." 

New Chancellor Marye Anne 
Fox agreed that tapping Simpson as 
the festival headliner was a wise 
decision. 

"As I understand, [Simpson] is 
very popular with today's youth, so 
I expect students will be thrilled to 
see her perform," Fox said. 

One complication with Simpson 
was the cost. 

"Originally we had settled on a 
price, but then suddenly Simpson 
manager decided they needed a 
second audio system," said 
Schreiber in a phone interview. 

This backup system, which was 
requested "in case of mechanical 
malfunction," added another $5,000 
to the cost, "taking money from 
other acts," Schreiber said. 

Potential crisis was averted 
when popular alternative-rockers 
the Gin Blossoms became available 
at a very affordable price. 

"The Gin Blossoms have a new 
CD corning out, and they have 
promised to do a set spodighting 
their new songs," said events coordi-
nator Michael Sharp. 

Though best known for hits such 
as "Follow You Down" and "Hear it 
from You," the Gin Blossoms have 
gone on to produce seven albums 
since being released from their 

record label in 1996. 
"Most people don't know their 

newer stuff," Shaw said. "They're 
looking forward to showing UCSD 
their new style instead of focusing 
on past hits." 

Opening the show will be the Los 
Angeles quartet Blackstreet, who have 
also agreed to cut out the profanity, 
despite being African-American. 

"I'm not actually familiar with the 
rap band," Fox said, "but as I under-
stand they had a very popular song 
and many UCSD students have been 
waiting to see this band perform for 
quite some time."

Campus spam 
distributor should die 

D o you care about the Laotian Student Association's hula-
hooping contest? 

Neither do we, and not 
only because we suck at any-
thing involving gyrations of 
the hips. So why does Paul 
Stravinsky in the SOLO office 
insist on e;ITJai ling every suck-
er on campus whenever a stu-
dent organization _plans to 
chug a little more Coke than 
usual, Triton Tide wants to 
bribe a record 20 people into 
attending Friday's basketball 
game, or "The Land Before 
Time XXIV" is showing at 
Price Center Theater for one 
night only? 

That's not a rhetorical 
question - we know why. It's 
because Paul Stravinsky is an 
evil, evil man. But that 's beside 
the point. 

Nothing makes me want to 

hunt down a faceless campus 
staff member and perform 
Chinese water torture more 
than campus-endorsed spam. 

Paul, buddy, the emails 
need to stop. They're cuttinf 
into our South Park time, ok. 

And no, we don't want to 
take the trouble to unsub-
scribe from the list. If more 
than two people on campus 
read the e-mails, then it 
would be worth it to have an 
opt-out option. But there 
isn't, so the students who 
want to receive the e-mails 
should have to opt in. Since 
they obviously have pl enty of 
time on their hands, they can 
go walk to the second Aoor of 
Price Center and write their 
name in blood to subscribe to 
the list for all we care. Or 
they can knit us a fuclcing 
sweater. We're a little chilly 
over here. 

Graduate students 
should get a real job 

Hey, graduate students: Go nome. Seriously, why are 
you still in school? Was 16 
years of avoiding the real world 
not enough ' 16 years l 

It's baa enough that you eat 
u~ all the good parking spaces. 
Its worse that you don't have 
the balls to actually use said 
spaces. But you reach the pin-
nacle of depravity when you 
chastise undergraduates for 
being late to section, when all 
those undergraduates needed to 
be on time was one of those 
wide-Fucking-open "B" spaces. 

"You're late," a TA might 
say, a glint of malice in her eye. 

God, what a bitch. 
But IVad srudents rarely see 

thjngs In thjs Light. Instead, 
they choose to moralize about 
academics. 

"Come to section prepared," 
a TA recently said. "If rou don't 
do the work; there isn t much I 
can do to help you." 

Well, if we were able to do 
the work on our own, we 
wouldn't need help, would we? 

It's high time that graduate 
srudents started taking respon-
sibi lity for our education. And 
that begins with giving us the 
answers to tomorrow's home-
work problems today. It doesn't 
do us any good to get them 
after the assignment IS due. In 
the fast-paced information 
economy of whatever century 
we're in, the lives of undergrad-
uates are jam-packed with more 
im\?ortant, time-consuming 
activities, Like lectures, ana 

foosball and stalking hot girls 
using the F acebook: And you 
can guess which way that one's 
going nine out of ten times. 

Why are you even bothering 
with a higher degree? Sure, 
when you're done with gradu-
ate school , you'll be able to get 
business cards with an MA 
after your names - or Ph.D., 
or D.D.S., or some other B.S. 
But what good is that? Tens of 
thousands of people have 
dropped out of fugh school at 
age 14 and gone on to be some 
of the finest doctors ever to 
cperate without a license. 
College dropouts have gone on 
to become prominent milkmen, 
plumbers and organ thieves. 
Graduate students, on the other 
hand, go on to become politi-
cians, serial killers and librari-
ans. Isn't the choice obvious? 

Go home, graduate stu -
dents, while you still have the 
chance. Undergraduates are 
tired of carpooling. We are 
tired of doing our own work. 
And we outnumber you four to 
one, bitches. 

Plus, we could probably beat 
the shit out of any pussies who 
actually go to school for 20 
years. Well, at least my room-
mate could. He's a pretty big 
guyWh' I k' . at we ac m expenence 
we make up for with resource-
fulness and inebriation. Keep in 
mind that the only difference 
between a "B" spot and an "5" 
spot is two cents' worth of yel-
low paint. And there's a lot of 
yeLlow paint in this world.

campus climate 

suppresses whites 
Dear Editor: 

I'm writing to commend your 
recent cpverage of the homo exu-
al couples kissing on campus. As a 
white male, I can totally under-
stand what they're going through. 
It's trendy to think that white 
males have it easy, but they ignore 
an insidious undercurrent that 
threatens all students: Asian 
Female Entitlement. 

Just walking around campus, 
one would think that all UCSD 
students have dyed hair, wear 
miniskirts and have 3.9 GPAs. 
Well I just want to say: We're 
white and we're male, and we're 
not gonna fail l 

Asian Female Entitlement has 
a serious effect that infringes 
upOI). the rights of white males. 
Asian women break the curve in 
every single class with their neat 
handwriting and comprehensive 
notes. As a result, professors fai l 
to understand that white males 
are people with needs too: needs 
like drinking beer and getting 
high. 1 wouldn't want to live in a 
world where a man can't just kick 
back and enjoy a few dozen Natty 
Ices during finals week, and I 
don 't think you would want to, 
either. 

This atmosphere of Asian 
Female Normativity needs to be 
stopped. White males are people 
too.

Dear Editor: 
1 happened to pick up your 

fucking shitrag of a paper the 
other day and I have to say, you 
guys are a bunch of fucking fag-
gots. God, your paper is so faggy, 
from the gay-ass front page to the 
flagrantly homosexual Sports sec-

because you're a bunch offucking 
gay-ass fruits who can't appreciate 
bomb-ass girls and actually think 
Pepsi Twist tastes good. You guys 
are all going to rot in hell and I 
hate you. Not to mention your 
rag got ink on my hands, and then 
I touched my new white shirt and 
it totally made it all gray and icky.

Beer gardens mayor 
may not be good 

Dear Editor. 
Let me begin by reiterating 

how honored I am to serve the fine 
instiruion of UCSD as your chan-
cellor. The job has proven to be 
challenging, bur it's nothing a few 
Valiums can't solve. 

r write today to address an issue 
that students have brought to my 
attention: beer gardens. At many 
universitie, beer gardens are a 
common and highly visible part of 

student life. In regards to the possi-
bility of beer gardens at UCSD: 
On one hand, UCSD students are 
mature, intelligent students who 
understand that beer is best 
enjoyed responsibly; on the other 
hand, most college students are 
alcoholics who use alcohol as an 
excuse to throw objects off their 
balconies, encase their roommate 
in duct tape and beat up their ex-
girlfriend. 

Regardless, 1 just want to do 
what's best for the enti re campus 
communi ty, including students, 
facul ty, staff and of course all five 
of the people who donate money 
to our school. 

Well, I'm not sure where I was 
going with this letter, but thanlcs 
for reading!

chocolate 

• IS sooo 
the best 

By PICKFIDDLER SMITH 
Resident Metro Guy 

It's about 10 p.m. You've been sit-
ting at Forever Fondue in La Jolla 
for so long you're starting to feel one 
with the soft vinyl benches, and that 
semi-raw steak you ate a few minutes 
ago is starting to work its congestive 
magic on your insides. Having sur-
vived through three courses so far -
cheese fondue, salad and the fondue 
dinner - you 're well aware that the 
best one - chocolate fondue - is 
yet to come. Dinnerware cleared, 
your (rather cute) waitress arrives 
with a question of ineffable impor-
tance, one 'to which there is only one 
correct answer: 

"Would you like Milk, White or 
Dark chocolate fondue this 
evening?" 

Many pleasant evenings turn ugly 
at this point. Invariably, there will be 
some scumbag in each otherwise 
well-bred group who has to make 
trouble for those of good taste by 
attempting to order anything but 
dark chocolate. In this situation there 
is only one thing to do: grasp your 
fondue skewer and stab the offending 
heathen in each pressure point 4 
(four) time, or until they forfeit, 
grovel (on the carpet) and admit your 
better taste. If you think they might 
be capable of reasoning, I've included 
a guide below with some arguments 
to make. Just remember: People who 
don't immediately acknowledge the 
empirical superiority of dark choco-
late over any other kind of chocolate 
exhibit at least one sign of severe 
mental impairment and/or inferiori-
ty. What kind of liberties you take 
with handicapped individuals such as 
these are at your own risk. (I just stab 
the motherfuckers.) 

The Rules of Good Taste For 
Chocolate: 

White chocolate is only for two 
kinds of people: ugly 12-year-old 
girls and idiots (notice how I differ-
entiated between the two). Almost 
everyone who likes white chocolate is 
automatically an idiot for thinking 
that it's act'Ulllly chocolate. It's not. It's 
just fake white liquid that they satu-
rate with cheap sugar (probably 
high-fructose corn syrup) until it 
turns into this murky semi-solid that 
looks like bird shit. It should be 
called Whitolate or Miracle Goop or 
something, not "white chocolate." 
Some people know white chocolate 
i n't really chocolate and order it 
anyway. These are ugly 12-year-old 
gi rls who think they're being clever 
or ironic but are really just being ugly 
12-year-old girls. If they try to say it 
tastes good, give 'em the slap they 
deselVe for being so wrong. Bottum 
lin" White chocolate is for idiots or 
your sister. Its possibly acceptable in 
a cookie with Macadamia nuts, or 
even without Macadamia nuts, but 
never as a substitute for real dark 
chocolate, and never as a dessen 
choice at Forever Fondue in LaJoUa, 
ever. 

That brings us to the Main 
Offender, the most incriminate, 
deceptive and worthless kind of 
chocolate. I'm talking about milk 
cbocolate - that pale, melty stuff you 
used to suck off your daddy\; fingers 
after he gave you the "M&M 
Treatment" back in third grade. Milk 
chocolate IS by fa r the most common 
kind of chocolate, which means that 
it's also the least-satisfying, slimy, 
tceth-rottingly-cheap shit that ever 
pas ed for a treat or confection on 
this base and classless planet. It tor-
tures vi rtuous tongues like Albertp 
G onzales, and will have your sca le 
groaning fas ter than Mark 
McGwire's stenods. Bottom line : 

tupid pe pie eat white chocolate; 
artless conformists, posers and 
worthless coward are their milk 
chocola te-favoring cOllnterparts.

Jack 
Johnson 

In Between Dreams 
Shitpop 

****1 
Since his debut, Br1Ishfire Foi7ytllLtS, Jack Johnson has proven himself to 
be one of pop's most artisti-
cally and socially relevant 
artists by combining mellow 
acoustic rock with lyrics of 
profound meaning, sung in 
his unforgettable warm 
ramble. It should be no sur-
prise then that this tropical 
troubadour's latest full -
length, the warm and fuzzy 
bl Buwun Dreams, is good 
- but even Johnson-lovers 
are not prepared for a work 
so brimming with lyrical 
genius and musical innova-
tion. 

Always a keen social 
obselVer and ardent com-
munitarian, Johnson pro-

vides what could be the per-
fect manifesto for a New 
Social Order on the classic 
opener "Better Together," 
and expands his thoughtful-
ness on the simple; brilliant, 
"Good People ." Aslong 
"Where did all the good 
people go/I've been chang-
ing channels I don't see 
them on the TV shows," 
Johnson delivers a scathing, 
yet hearne! t a ttack on 
American popular culture. 

But hI Bttwem Dnnms 
isn't a manifesto of merely 
social importance. Johnson 
has always offered dreamy, 
poetic ruminations on life, 
and his new songs continue 
the modest temper and sub-
tle reflection of his previous 
work. "Banana Pancakes" 
and "Staple it Together" 
both testify to his expertise 
at reprogramming the teeny 
details of life into weighty 
symbols, then using them to 
reintroduce us to the joys 
and sorrows of existence. 

He may sing smoothly 
and strum softly, but 
Johnson is a true poet of the 
ages - a Marley or Dylan 
of his time. In Betwem . 
Dreams will go down as a 
watershed work in folk-rock 
- and perhaps human -
history.

Autobiography 
Ugly Reality 

**** 

In Latin, the phrase "autobiogra phy" liter-ally mea ns "a book 
about someone ." Ashley . 
Simpson ha s obviously 
been studying her Latin, 
because Autobiograpby is 
indeed about someone, 
namely, her. If you 
haven't heard of Ashley 
Simpson, you probably 
have heard of her talent-
ed older sister "Jessica" 
Simpson, married to 
Nick Lachey (formerly of 
the Backstreet Boys) and 
starring in Vh 1 's 
"Newlymarrieds." Well , 
it turns out that Ashley 
is, like her sister, incredi -
bly ta lented. Unlike 
Jessica , Ashlee's CD is a 

rock CD, and also Ashlee 
ha s dark hair. But Ash is 
more than just a pretty 
face and a beatiful voice. 
She is also an experi-
enced dancer and is quite 
good at bowling, accord-
ing to her Web site. 

In the hit single 
"Living in the shadows," 
Ashlee admits to feeling 
like she was "living in the 
shadows" along with her 
sister, Jessica. Ashlee also 
shows her sexy side on 
Autobiograpby, for exam-
ple, on "La La" she sings 
"You make me wanna La 
La!" 

Thanks to television 
ap peara n ces last year on 
SNL and the Orange 
Bowl , Ashley isn't 
"Living in the Shadows" 
anym o re. Sudents here at 
University of California, 
SO will get to see Ashley 
next month on the Son 
God festival. 

So get out your best 
" m ush pi t OO clothes 
because it is going to be a 
rocking good time. What 
could go wrong?

posed to, like, go here ?]

Oevil's Playground 
Rehash 

Donning my leather jacket over my bare (a nd 1 mean bare) 
chest, I popped in the new 
Billy Idol for a go-around 
on the Colecovision 
(Edi tor 'S note: wtP. Don'r 
you play video games on 
that motherfucker?) that I 
keep under my H e-Man 
tape collection. 
Synchronizing my 12 
watches, I prepared to dive 
into the newest from 
Blondie "Prince" Billy, the 
man who has convinced me 
to "dance with myself" 
about seven times a night. 

Track one. It's c~lled 
"Super Overdrive." Not 
"White Wedding." 

The next track, some 

number called "World 
Coming Down," isn 't 
"White Wedding" either. 

After that is something 
called "Rat Race," which I 
swear is not actually 
"White Wedding." 

A quick glance at the 
title for the next confirms 
the worst. Not " Wll ite 
Weddihg." Fuck. 

"Plastic Jesus" is a nice 
try, but not "White 
Wedding." 

Now, I saw "Scream" on 
VH I, so it might actually 
be """'hite Wedding," bur I 
couldn 't tell because I had 
muted it. (Do you think I'd 
watch VHI witll the sound 
on?) 

"Yellin ' at th e Xm as 
Tree" it seems, is definitel y 
nor """'hite Wedding." 

The three next songs, 
unanimously so, are not 
"White Wedding." The 
following song' ot 
"White Wedding," either. 

In fact, this whole fuck-
ing album doesn't have 
"White Wedding" any-
where on it. Fucking A. I 
guess I'll go dance with 
myself to the Greatert Hm. 

And that video of bare-
chested Bill y. 

Bill y Idol will perform 
at my house next Tuesday.

Lawn bowling team 
winning streak ends 
Tritons eliminated from 

NCAA Elite Eight 
By MPHEN GLASS 
Plagiarist Extraordinaire 

Beating all odds in its innaugur-
al eason, the UCSD lawn bowling 
team's unprecedented success 
through the third round of the 
NCAA ational Lawn Bowling 
Tournament in Broken Arrow, 
Okla ., came to a close with a 
fourth-round loss to defending 
national champion Bob Jones 
University from South Carolina . 

"This is just tota lly unbeliev-
able," head coach John Deere said. 
"Everyone who came out for the 
team this year was so determined 
that they never even considered 
losing an option." 

The loss marks the end of a 23-
consecutive-game winning streak 
for the Tritons, who were not offi-
cially granted CM status until 
July 14, 2004 - just three days 
before the start of the arduous 
eight-month season. 

"These guys deserve every drop 
of their success," Deere said . "I 
don 't think that even the biggest 
fans in the lawn bowling world 
realize how hard this team has had 
to work to get thi far." 

The Tritons' practice schedule 
has consisted of two two-hour 
workouts six days a week for the 

entire season, consisting of weights 
and cardio conditioning in the 
mornings, followed by afternoon 
scrimmages. 

"I still can't get over how well 
we did," senior Eli Lutske said. 
"Since I was young, I dreamt about 
succeeding at lawn bowling and 
that dream is becoming a reality 
now." 

For the record, lawn bowling is 
not a sport. But that does not pre-
vent some people from trying to 
justify it as one. Listen, people: 
there is a difference between a 
sport and a game. Games are little 
bites of a sport. Sports have things 
like NCAA Tournaments, but 
games do not. Sports require both 
athleticism and skill, while games 
require either boredom or the 
opportunity to drink. 

It is safe to call basketball or 
football or tennis sports - they 
meet the forementioned require-
ments. Games are things like lawn 
bowling, golf, NASCAR, tradition-
al bowling and horseshoes. See the 
similarities? Remember the rule: if 
you can concievably drink a beer 
while playing your "sport," th'en 
you are deceived - you are playing 
a game.

Conversion of field to

By IONA YACHT 
Heck Yeah I Do 

In a press conference held just 
minutes ago, Director of Athletics 
Tubby McFatguy announced that 
the field below RIMAC Arena 
would be converted to cater to 
motor sports. 

"The field sucks now," 
McFatguy said. "What it needs 
are some jumps and some fast cars 
and shit, you know?" 

The plans will go into effect 

immediately following the con-
clusion of the softball home 
schedule, and are expected to cost 
upwards ofSI2 million. 

"Cost is of no concern to me," 
McFatguy said. "I don't think 
anyone can deny that there is no 
offroad course on this campus, am 
I right?" 

With regards to the displace-
ment of the home fields of several 
UCSD athletics tearns, McFatguy

Steroid scandal rocks UCSD 
Compromising evidence stacked against Tritons 

By RON KARKOVICE 
Double A Superstar 

Tritons baseball head coach 
Keith Hackbarth and the UCSD 
athletics department were 
informed March 28 that several 
members of the Tritons lineup 
would be suspended indefinitely 
pending an investigation into 
charges alleging an illicit steroid 
distribution ring and the use of 
substances banned by the NCAA. 

"We were advised to look into 
the situation after coaches from a 
number of Division II baseball 
programs complained about 
UCSD's distinct size- advantage 
over its opponents," NCAA 
spokesman Chris Anderson said. 

The allegations, on which 
UCSD officials have declined to 
comment, stem from a pro-
nounced acceleration in growth 
and stamina of Triton athletes in 
the baseball program over the last 
four years. In 2000, the average 
incoming Tri ton stood 5 feet 10 
inches and weighed 174 pounds, 
while the average graduating 
senior was 5 feet II inches, 186 
pounds. Today, the average size of 
an incoming athlete has hardly 
changed, but the seniors are a dif-
ferent story. This year, the average 
graduating Triton baseball player 
is 6 feet, 3 inches and weighs in at 
217 pounds. 

"Is there reaJly any question of 
guilt here?" rival University of San 
Diego head coach Drew Melgar 
asked. "Normal-size boys are going 

Students 
at higher 
risk for 
ANCD 

By A. D. DEE 
Ritalin Poppin' Papi 

Doctors are warning students at 
UCSD and other academically rig-
orous higher learning institutions 
in the country to mind dangerous-
ly high levels of stress, after UC 
Davis men's soccer All-American 
Claude Baxter was killed as a result 
of Acute Neurological 
Compression Disorder. 

"ANCD is rare, but extremely 
serious," Princeton neurologist 
Franz van Spiezleberger said. "It is 
the result of an intensely stressful 
lifestyle, but the most harmful 
effects are triggered by an unusual-
ly high spike in those stress levels." 

Baxter, a bioengineering-organ-
ic chemistr), "major, was at the peak 
of his finals studying late on the 
night of March 16, when he decid-
ed to blow off some steam at the 
gym. Already under pressure to 
maintain his perfect GPA going 
into three consecutive March 17 
exams, Baxter was also juggling 
offers from a variety of jobs and 
graduate schools. Combined with 
the four cups of coffee he con-
sumed late that day, Spiezleberger 
said the accident was just waiting to 
happen. 

As soon as he started to work 
out, his head just popped -literal-
ly exploded," Spiezleberger said,

to UCSD when they're freshman, 
and they leave four or five years 
later looking like they were hit by 
the testosterone truck." 

The coaches who filed the 
grievance with the NCAA moscly 
represent programs from within 
the California Collegiate Athletic 
Association. 

"llis isn't the first time that 
we've tried to bring attention to the 
actions taking place at UCSD," 
Temecula State head coach Travis 
Usrey said. "Finally those guys are 
going to get what they deserve." 

The investigation, which was 
launched March 29, is expected to 
last through the remainder of the 

regular season. 
Looking into the Feb. 16 arrest 

of Robin Gordon, a San Diego 
man who was held by Border 
Patrol upon re-entering the 
United States from Tijuana, 
Mexico, with a large quantity of 
anabolic steroids, police discov-
ered that Gordon was then in the 
employment of Hackbarth as a 
trainer for the Tritons. 

Gordon has worked closely 
with athletes under suspicion, 
including senior longball sensa-
tions David Anderson and James 
Cain.

Athletic department 
expanding publicity 
Plan follows in steps of 
great basketball legacies 

By MC HORACE HO 
Badassmuthafuckah 

Following yet another bland 
season for the Tritons men's bas-
ketball program, UCSD 
Athletics has resolved to launch 
a new tactic in its ongoing strug-
gle to recruit fans, bolster team 
pride and build school spirit: 
celebrity fans. 

"Beginning at the first home 
basketball game in 2006, UCSD 
alumnus and 
celebrity 
author of 
"Sideways" 
Rex Pickett 
wiJI be court-
side for all 
home games," 
U C S D 
Athletics 
spokesman 
Duke Van 
Balegooie 
said. 

V a n 

Ru Pickett 
UCSD celebrity 
and author of 

'Sideways~ 

Ballegoie went on to comment 
on the success of teams like the 
Los Angeles Lakers, who are 
notorious for having at least one 
celebrity present at courtside for 
home games. 

"Jack Nicholson is half the 
reason that people go to those 
games," Van Balegooie said. 
"Am 1 right? Can I get a 'hell 
yeah'?" 

He went on to pOint out Bill 
Murray's recent attendance at 
Illinois men's basketball games 

and Ashley Judd sightings at the 
University of Kentucky. Each 
team's success, paired with that 
of the New York Knicks during 
Spike Lee's better years spells 
wins for UCSD. 

Pickett is a 1989 UCSD 
graduate who has been in the 
press lately for his novel-turned 
film "Sideways." 

"What?" Pickett said, appar-
ently uninformed of his appoint-
ment as the token UCSD 
celebrity. "I live in New York." 

In addition, A.S. Triton Tide 
will outfit Pickett with a full 
Triton Tide wardrobe including 
the popular foam finger. Triton 
Tide President Silk Shocker will 
personally ensure that Pickett's 
nacho hat is always full. 

Pickett will also get trans-
portation from the exclusive 
Santee Executive Limo 
Company. 

However, the cost of Pickett's 
appearances has forced the 
department to fire the entire 
UCSD coaching staff. The 
department will recruit local 
YMCA coaches to volunteer 
instead. 

"It's not much of a loss," Van 
Balegooie said. "But then again, 
I'm not much of a person." 

He proceeded to remove 
from his pants a giant mechani-
cal dildo and, clutching it 
beneath his loins, approached 
the beef curtains in front of the
