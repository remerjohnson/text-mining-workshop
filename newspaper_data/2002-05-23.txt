One--day 
nurse strike 
may occur 
on May 29 
Replacement 
nurses sought 
By GEOFF DIETRICH 
News Editor 

A stalemate in labor talks 
between the California Nurses 
t\s~oclation and the University of 
California will likely lead ro a 
strike by nurses at ·UC medical 
centers throughout the state, bOth 
side said Wednesday. 

UCSD Medical Center 
Hillcrest, Thornton IIospital and 
Student Health Services would all 
be effected by the one-day strike 
set to occur May 29. 

C A is not optimistic that sig-
nificant progress will be made to 
jump-start negotiations, which is 
what it would take avoid the strike, 
CNA spokesman Carl Bloice said. 

No talks occurred Wednesday 
because they were not expected to 
be "fruitful, " said UC Human 
Resources spokesman Paul 
Schwartz. 

CNA is waiting for the 
University of California to make 
the first move. 

"As soon as we get the incen-
tive from them we will return to 
the negotiating table," Bloice said. 

At this point only serious nego-
tiations can avoid the one-day 
strike, Bloice said. 

The main points of contention 
between the two sides are compen-
sation and mandatory overtime. 
The university favors pay raises 
based on job performance whereas 
CNA is asking for raises based on 
seniority. 

Now both sides are planning 
for the strike. 

In the event of a one-day strike, 
the university is planning to use 
replacement nurses. CNA is "out-
raged" over the development, 
Bloice said. 

CNA believes it is better to 
postpone surgery and move 
patients to unaffected medical 
facilities rather than bring in out-
side nurses who are unfamiliar with 
the hospitals and patients, Bloice 
said. 

Replacement nurses are already 
being used as needed to ensure that 
patient care does not decrease dur-

Koala hearing goes on despite walkout 
Administration representative leaves after media stays 
By EVAN McLAUGHIN 
Associate News Editor 

The UCSD administration refused to 
present its case against Tbe Koala in a judi-
cia l board hearing Wednesday evening after 
the board denied the admini tration's objec-
tion to the presence of media at the pro-
ceedings. 

University representative Cara A. 
Silbaugh, assistant dean of student affairs 
at Eleanor Roosevelt College, motioned to 
overturn the board's decision to admit 
media immediately following the calling of 
order by presiding judicial board officer 
Parisa Baharian. The board denied the 
university's motion, prompting Silbaugh's 
voluntary departure from the proceedings.

Davis to slash UC 
funding by S 162 M 
Governor to cut education 
to make up for huge deficits 
By EVAN McLAUGHLIN 
Associate News Editor 

Because of a state budget 
shortfall that has doubled since its 
original draft in January, funding 
cuts to the University of 
California will total about $162 
million, according to Gov. Gray 
Davis' May revision to the 2002-
03 state budget. A finalized bud-
get is not expected until at least 
June 30. 

While the governor's most 
recent revision protects what UC 
officials call "core" functions, 
meaning fulfilling the funding 
quota for undergraduate enroll-
ment growth while compensating 
for an average pay increase of about 
1.5 percent to eligible staff and fac-
ulty, substantial cuts were made to 
research, instructional technology 
and K-12 outreach funding. 

"[Ibe university) really has two 
reactions to the new revisions," said 

Opinion 
Put aside your miSConcepllOflS 
about Muslim naditJonal 

UC spokesperson Brad Hayward. 
"First off, we are disappointed at 
the cuts because they affect impor-
tant programs that provide valuable 
service to the state." 

Hayward also said the univer-
sity appreciates that Davis has 
avoided "impacting the core 
instructional programs." 

The subsidization of an addi-
tional 600 full-time students sys-
temwide was also implemented in 
the May revision, resulting in a 
total enrollment increase of 7,700 
students for the next school year. 

However, Margaret F. Pryatel, 
assistant vice chancellor of resource 
management at UCSD, contends 
that the budgets current condition 
does not fulfill the needs of the uni-
versity, especially in research. 

"It's disappointing," Pryatel 
said. "[UC Vice President for

Mixed Race Awareness 
Day debuts on campus 
Hapa Club sponsors inaugural 
event by educating campus 
By REBECCA WOOD 
Senior Staff Writer 

UCSD's Hapa Club hosted 
the first ever Mixed Race 
Awareness Day on Wednesday, 
manning information tables on 
Library Walk to educate UCSD 
about the mixed-race communi-
ty. 

"We are here to embrace a 
community," said Hapa Club 
president Emily Leach, regarding 
the event. "People don't really see 
[the) presence of mixed-race stu-
dents on campus." 

The club distributed pam-

phlets noting census figures of 
multiracial people in the United 
States, a history of multiracial 
people in North America, and 
information about mixed-race 
civil rights and mixed-race 
celebrities. 

Attendees were encouraged to 
sign a petition to create a mixed-
race course at UCSD. 

"[At UCSD) certain organi za-
tions cater to certain groups, but 
Hapa is unique in that it address-
es issues of mixed-race smdents," 
said Thurgood Marshall College

Koala: 
Publication introduces 
its defense at hearing 
Continued from page 1 
the university's withdrawal from 
the proceedings, The Koala made a 
decision to present an incomplete 
version of its defense, where only a 
handful of The Koala's witnesses 
testified and no tangible evidence 
was presented. 

" 0 matter what the university 
wanted to do, we wanted to clear 
our good name," said Robert 
Forouzandeh, the student advo-
cate general representing The 
Konla. "However, we presented a 
very stripped-down case to protect 
our strategy." 

Koala Editor in Chief George 
Liddle, Konla principal member 
Jeremy Rode and Koala senior staff 
member Robert Lanuzza were the 
only witnesses called to testify on 
behalf of the accused. 

The Koala was brought before 
the judicial board after being 
accused by the university of violat-
ing section 22.14.10.27 of the stu-
dent conduct code. The universi ty 
alleges that Koala members' atten-
dance at a Movimiento 
Esrundiantal Chicana/o de Aztl:in 
meeting on Nov. 19,2001 was an 
"obstruction or disruption of 
teaching, research, administration, 
disciplinary procedures, or other 
UCSD or University activities." 

Photographs of MEChA offi-
cer Ernesto Martinez were taken 
at the meeting and used in a Koala 
issue later that month, as corrobo-
rated by The Koala at T hursday'S 
hearing. 

In the hearing's opening com-
ments, Forouzandeh said that The 
Koala would provide the judicial 
board with evidence that the pho-
tographer at the MEChA meeting 
was not affiliated with The Konla, 
that the photograph of Martinez 
was not sanctioned by The Koala, 
and that the MEChA meeting was 
not disturbed while members of 
The Koala were in attendance. 

SRTV engineer Josh Shupack 
argued that the media should keep 
the public informed about IT,dtters 
such as the &ala's judicial board 
hearing. 

"Having the media present 
keeps the legal process account-
able," hupack said. "If tht: doors 
are closed, anything can happen 
wi thout the public knowing about 
it." 

The judicial board \vill 
recomcnd a resolution to the 
deparonent of srudent policy and 
judicial affairs following its delibera-
tions.

Sun God creator de Sait Ph aIle dies at 71 
Niki de Saint Phalle, the contemporary artist who 

created the Sun God sculpture, died Tuesday in San 
Diego at the age of 71 after 11 long illness. 

Phalle created the Sun God in 1983. It was her 
first large outdoor work in the United States and is a 
prominent landmark on campus. The Sun God is a 
colored sculpture of a 14-foot bird located on the 
liI'Ml between the Faculty dub and Mandeville 
~uditorium and is one of UCSD's most recognized 
Icons. 

It was the first piece of artwork commissioned 
for the Stuart CoUection. 

Phalle is known for her enlarged works, which recall 
contradictory traits such as good and evil, modem and 
primitive, sacred and profane, and play and terror. 

In 1981 she wrote "AIDS: You Can't Catch It 
Holding Hands,· which was later made into film by 
the same name in 1989. 

Phalle was born in 1930 in the Paris suburb of 
. Neuilly-sur-Seine as Catherine Marie-Agnes Fal de 
Saint Phalle. She moved to New York in 1937 with 
her pa rents where she spent time visiting the 
Metropolitan Museum of Art. 

UCSD awarded for conbibutions 
to clean air in San Diego 

San Diego EarthWorks has awarded UCSD with a 
Very Important Planet Clean Air Award for its volun-
tary installation of a cogeneration plant 

The 12th annual VIP awards banquet was recent-
ly held by San Diego EarthWorks to celebrate San 
Diego businesses and institutions that contribute to 
a cleaner environment. San Diego County Supervisor 
Pam Slater presented UCSD's award, which was 
accepted by Lany Oberti, a UCSD environmental 
issues manager. 

The awara comes from last year's completion of 
a 25-megawatt cogeneration plant that provides 
electrical and steam power to campus. The SCONOx 
emissions system used by the UCSD cogeneration 
plant is one of the first commercial installations of 
the new technology.

Budget: 
Outreach among the 
deepest cut programs 
Continued from page 1 
has been fighting to protect fund-
ing, and the governor has tried to 
do that. But there are too many cuts 
to necessary programs." 

Among the key cuts are funding 
reductions to research, a principle 
element at UCSD. While Davis has 
proposed a targeted $32 million cut 
to research - a 10 percent reduc-
tion from last year's alloca tion -
the specific programs facing cuts 
\vill be made at the discrc:tion of the 
University of California. 

Government officials estimated 
carlier this year that the state bud-
get would be cut about by $1 2 bil-
li on. Hillary McLean, a spokesper-
son for Davis, says that a number of 
factors has emerged in the econo-
my since January.

ing the planned one-day strike and 
to prevent the non striking nurses 
&om being overworked, Schwartz 
said. 

Both sides agree that using 
replacement workers during strikes 
at hospitals is common, but CNA 
believes that using them is a breach 
of the public's trust. 

"For a public entity - UC -
to employ such strikebreakers, to 
spend the public's money .. . we 
find that unconscionable," Bloice 
said. 

By using replacement nurses 
during the strike, the university 
says it is simply maintaining patient 
care. 

"As a responsible employer, we

The Hapa Club bills itself as the

The club promotes diversity on 
campus and works to provide a 
space and community for the 
mixed-race community. 

"Parr of the college experience

"What we found earlier this year 
was off," McLean said. "The 
national economic slowdown has 
continued, resulting in a drop-off in 
state revenues from capital gains, 
income, sales and corporate taxes." 

According to Pryatel, UCSD 
research programs that may possi-
bly see funding cuts include the 
Scripps lnstitution of 
Oceanography, the Interstate 5 
bridge seismology project, 
Internet2 and the San Diego 
Supercomputer Center, among 
others. 

Another significant revision is a 
one-time $29 million cut to the 
budget for instructional technolo-
gy, equipment and deferred mainte-
nance. Included in this line item is 
funding for library resources and 
the upkeep of facilities . 

In addition, a $28.4 million 
reduction will be made to funding 
for K-12 outreach; a 40 percent cut 
to the program for the 2002 -03 fis-
cal year. Specific cuts to outreach 

have an obligation to do what we 
feel is best to serve our patients 
during the day of the strike," 
Schwartz said. 

Healthcare Consulting & 
Staffing Services, which provides 
temporary nurses, has a Web site 
that lists May 29 as a date when 
nurses would be needed in 
California. According to tile Web 
site, pay would be $1,000 for the 
day's 12-hour shift, plus "deluxe 
accommoda tions." 

Nurse Bridge, another tempo-
rary nurse staffing company, is 
under contract with the University 
of California but would not discuss 
the matter, said Nurse Bridge 
President Carol Feuger. 

The UC contracts with outside 
companies for temporary nurses, 
not the nurses directly, so contrac-
tual nutters such as pay are not 
within the university's control, 
Schwartz said. 

Should replacement nurses be

these bring diverse issues to stu-
dents." 

Hapa is a Hawaiian word, which 
used to be a derogatory term mean-
ing half Japanese-Hawaiian and 
half foreigner, according to pam-
phlets at the table. Now it is used to 
describe anyone of partial Asian or 
Pacific lsI and ancestry. 

The event is about raising 
awareness of people of mixed eth-
nic backgrounds, not only of mixed 
Asian descent, Leach said. 

"The event helps to educate

programs include a $1.2 million 
reduction to C.R.E.A.T.E. and a 
$750,000 cut to ArtsBridge, effec-
tively eliminating both. 

UC AC.C.O.R.D. faces a cut of 
$500,000, while $490,000 is estimat-
ed to be cut from the university's 
graduate-professional outreach ser-
vice and $12 million from the 
School-University Partnerships pro-
gram. 

While the May revision calls for 
no new reductions to the Preuss 
School, UCSO's charter academy 
will sti ll face an originall y-pl anned 
cutback of $422 ,000. 

While the state constiru tion 
mandates that the upcoming fi scal 
year's budget be signed in hy June 
30, Pryatel doubts that the deadline 
will be met. 

"I will be very surprised if the 
budget is finalized by June 30,"

ture still needs to make its recom-
mendations and changes."

SHS has not asked for nurses 
and it is not part of the medical 
center's request for replacements, 
according to Director of Student 
Health Brian Murray. Supervisory 
nurses, medical assistants and 
physicians wi ll staff the urgent care 
clinic. 

At Thornton Hospital and 
UCSD Medical Center Hillcrest, 
the exact number of temporary 
nurses that could be used is unde-
termined. 

Predicting an exact number now 
is difficult, said public information 
officer for UCSD Healthcare 
Eileen Callahan, because officials 
are still assessing the strike-day 
needs of each hospital. 

Adding to the problem is that 
not all nurses plan to strike and the 
hospital will try to keep patients to 
a minimum by rescheduling elec-
tive surgeries, she said.

"There are a lot more mixed race

about Japan and America's inter-
cultural children, and documents 
the stories of families created in

interviewed multiracial students 
in the Price Center for the pro-
duction.

Poliq change 
signals a move 
in right direction 

The UC Regents recently voted to extend 
death-related retirement benefits to the 
domestic partners of UC employees. 
According to the UC Office of the 
President, the new policy stipulates that if a 
UC employee is a member of the UC 
retirement plan, his or her domestic partner 
will receive benefits equal to those given to 
the spouses of married UC employees. 

The Gum'dian applauds the regents ' deci-
sion and supports the university's recogni-
tion of domestic partnerships. Prior to this 
decision, only traditio,nal families could 
receive spousal benefIts from the university, 
perhaps preventing high-quality faculty and 
staff from joinmg the UC system. 
Furthermore, the to-date exclusion of 
domestic partners revealed an inability to 
:.Iccept sOCIal change that simply should not 
be tolerated within the poliCIes of a public 
institution of higher learning. 

Furthermore, the regents passed the 
move to extend health coverage to domestic 
partners of either sex in 1997 by on ly one 
vote, 13-12, over the opposition of then-
!Tovernor and board member Pete Wilson. 
fhe ease with which retirement benefits 
were extended to domestic fartners last 
week shows the regents' an California's 
social progression in just five years, a pro-
gression that the Guardian commends. 

Chargers: Like it 
or leave it, don't 
use our funds 

San Diego Mayor Dick Murphy recently 
announced that he will not rule out using 
public h.mds to finance a new football stadium 
for the San Diego Chargers. The Guardia11 
feels that the Charger should be content with 
the more-than-adequate stadium that they 
have, or pack up ;md move. 

In :.In era when every team wants a new sta-
dium seemingly every other year, the 
Chargers are lucky to have a beautiful stadi-
Ulll that has been picked to host the Super 
Bowl twice in the last six years (1998 and soon 
to be 2003). Tn 1997, the stadium was 
revamped for the 1998 Super Bowl. The open 
end of the stadiwll was closed and an addi-
tional 11,000 seats were added. 

The Chargers are threatening to move to 
Los Angeles If they don't get a new stadium. 
It is ridJculous for the team to think that the 
city should build a new stadium just four rears 
after renovating Qualcomm into one of the 
best football stadiums in the league. 

The worst part of the ordeal is that Murphy 
is still considerin!T I?ublic funds. He should tell 
the Chargers th,l t Jf they want a stadiwn that 
bad, amI they rea lly want to stay in San Diego 
as tlley have s;ud, then they should pay for it 
themselves. The lines that the team is pitching 
to the ci~ about generating revenue around a 
new stadllUll are simply unfounded and have 
been proven false. Under no circumstances 
should city funds be used.

Uncovering the truth behind 
traditional Muslim hijab 

Recent, well-publicized case highlights the 
West's misperceptions of a cultural tradition 

By CATHERINE J. NAVARRO 
Contributing Writer 

In the tempestuous climate of the 
West's relations with the Muslim world, 
brought so strikingly to Western attention 
in the last eight months, one American 
servicewoman is fighting a battIe that typ-
ifies the many shades of gray in this arena. 

Nearly a decade ago, Lt. Col. Martha 
MeSally, the top female fighter pilot in 
the U.S. Air Force, brought a lawsuit 
against the Deparnnent of Defense for 
mandating that servicewomen at U.S. 
bases in Saudi Arabia garb themselves 
modestly from head to toe when they 
travel off base. 

MeSally alleged that the military 
should not be able ro require American 
women to adhere ro the religious cus-
toms of another culture and country. 
The Department of Defense retorted 
that the requirement protects women 
traveling off U.S. military bases. 
'Nearing the "abaya" - a head-to-toe 
covering that is a form of the "hijab," or 
modest dress in Islam - demonstrates 
cultural sensitivity, the department 
argued . However, after a time, the 
department loosened its restrictions and 
changed the wording of the requirement 
so that it would no longer be required, 
but "strongly advised." 

Last week, the House of 
Representatives passed a bill that would 
dissolve any such restrictions on what ser-
vicewomen wear in the desert kingdom 
when not on base. 

The issues up for debate in this case are 
nontrivial and touch on soft spots for 
Muslims and non-Muslims alike. 

First of all, McSallys contention that 
the requirement was unconstitutional 
seems a fair enough judgment: Neither the 
U .. government nor its operatives should 
be able to force its citizens to adhere to the 
dres code of another counay. When they 
join the military, Americans understand 
that they have entered into a sphere the 
dictates of which are different from the 
public arena. Unifonnity and hierarchy 

are imposed in the anned services in a way 
that does not exist analogously for private 
citizens, and soldiers understand this 
implicitly as being part of the system. 

But control over soldiers' normative 
dress and behavior can only extend so far 
before First Amendment rights begin to 
be infringed, and it is the responsibility of 
the Depamnent of Defense - and the 
courts that arbitrate - to ensure that these 
rights are not trounced. 

It's interesting to note, on the other 

Far from being an 
instrument of oppression 

or the exclusion of women 
from society, following the 
hijab is a mark of love and 
respect for the self and for 
the Quran. Musl im women 
extol the experience as a 

visible commitment to 
leading a life of goodness 
and nobility as the Quran 

instructs. 

hand, that it wa's a U.S. cOlTUnander in 
Saudi Arabia who origina lly imposed the 
requirement to follow the hijab - not a 
Saudi. According to an interview with 
Salon. cum, MeSally said she discovered that 
"Saudis aren't officially aslang for [U.S. 
servicewomen to follow the hijab)." While 
military officials cited "host nation sensi-
tivity" as the reason for the dress ccxle, 
there does not appear to have been any caU 
for it from Saudi officials. 

This discrepancy leads directly to the 
crux of the ma ner, which is the differ-
ence in understanding of the hijab 
between the Muslim world and the West. 
The West has demonstrated time and 
time again that it does not have a good 
grasp of the precepts of the hijab, calling 
it "oppressive" and "antifeminist." In the 

SIlIon.cum interview, McSally said, "The 
problem is that the people who came up 
with the [Deparnnent of Defensel policy 
are not women." In saying so, she 
demonstrated that she perceived the 
issue not as one concerning respect for a 
foreign culture and custom, but through 
a very Western-slanted take on what 
women's freedom should encompass. 

If the issue can be represented as one 
about the oppression of women, it is actu-
ally about the U.S. goverrunent's misrep-
resentation of a Muslim tenet, not the 
Saudis' religious customs. 

I hope that my Muslim readership 
will indulge the attempts of a Colombian 
Catholic to represent her perception of 
the purpose and intent of the hijab in 
Islam, keeping in mind that such percep-
tions come not from religious experience 
but from interaction with Muslims, the 
Holy Quran and scholarly tractates on 
the subject. 

It seems that McSally perceives her 
fight against following the hijab as a fight 
against the oppression of women. It seems 
also that the U.S. government authorities 
who ignored her for so long felt likewise, 
exploiting the nuanced issue as an oppor-
nmity to prevent women's discourse on 
the subject through the imposition of a 
unilateral mandate. 

Neither position appears to have much 
regard for how the majority of Muslims 
perceive the hijab. Far from being an 
instnnnent of oppression or d,e excl usion 
of women from society, following the hija b 
is a marie of love and respect for the se lf 
and for the Quean. Muslim women extol 
the experience as a visible commitment to 
leading a life of goodness and nobility a 
the Quran instructs. And, lest there be any 
confusion, the twenty-fourth Quranic 
Sueah, NUT, instructs men and women 
alike to garb themselves mo<lestly: During 
the obligatory "Hajj," or pilgrimage to 
Mecca that all Muslims make at Icast once, 
this is particularly apparent because lnil-
lions of men are seen clad in simple white

Responsible use of drugs is a far cry from abuse 
The government often tries to scare citizens by giving exaggerated information 
By LOGAN GOH 
Staff Writer 

Right now, we have access to 
many sources of information about 
narcotics, but no easy methcxl to 
verify their truth or reliability. Like 
most children, I grew up hearing 
about the evi ls of drugs. For a time, 
I believed the government-spon-
sored campaigns implicitly, even 
though I had never tried any drugs 
myself. 

But as I grew older, it became 
increasingly difficult to believe in 
the government's perspective on 
drugs. Fallacies in logic and expla -
nation became more and more 
obvious. 

A good and recent example 
would be the latest government 
attempt to stamp out drugs by link-
ing drug money to terrorists -
while completely ignoring the fact 
that the gas people use in their 
sport utility vehicles is a much 
greater source of terrorist funding. 

After looking through a number 
of sources with many different bias-
es, I have come to the conclusion 
that drugs are not quite the end of

the world, as the government 
would like you to believe. 

When I speak of drugs from 
here on, I am focusing mostly on 
marijuana - which, despite legisla-
tion, remains widespread in the 
United States and has yet to cause 
the collapse of our civilization. 

However, my argument applies 
to other, perhaps more dangerous 
substances as well. Even for some-
thing that is so recognized as irre-
deemably dangerous as cracle 
cocaine, I believe that instead of 
making it illegal, the government 
should educate the public about it 
and regulate its use. As citizens 
within a democracy, we should be 
given a choice, even if it is a choice 
to do something stupid. 

A distinction has to be made 
between use and abuse. Anything 
ca n be abused. You would probably 
feel Ii lee shit after a 36-hour cocaine 
binge. But if you were to binge on 
chocolate for 36 hours straight, you 
would also be in bad shape. 

It is important to point out that 
all the horror stories we hear are 
about drug abust and not drug lISt. 
And we know for a fact that drugs 

judged against the rat race of people 
clamoring to be the first to wear the 
latest Gucci , Armani Exchange or 
Banana Republic goods. Instead, 
judgment comes through one's own 
merits, accomplishments and intel-
ligence. The hijab returns the focus 
to the individual, partially circum-
venting the all-too-convenient 
American instinct to make dismis-
sive generalizations based upon 
appearance alone. 

However, do any of these things 
mean that servicewomen in a foreign

can be used responsibly, or at least 
for an extended period of time 
without harm. 

The bans on cocaine, opium and 
marijuana did not occur until the 
early 20th century. For hundreds of 
years before that, these substances

were in widespread use without any 
serious problems. Coca-Cola, for 
example, contained cocaine until 
public opinion (but not any actual 
health problems) caused the manu-
facturers to remove it. 

In fact, I would venture to say 

country should be required, or even 
encouraged, to follow suit? It's not 
likely. All the same, they do demon-
strate that the Wests misperception 
of the purpose ofIslams mcxlesty in 
dress has resulted in a knee-jerk 
reaction to Muslim custom. And 
unfortunately, that Icnee-jerk reac-
tion has created gross generaliza-
tions, along wi th the exploitation of 
the precepts of the hijab in the 
West's own quibbles concerning 
feminism. 

Interestingly, Muslim percep-

that the currenr level of risk for 
the modern drug addic t is proba-
bly increased by the government's 
attitude. Automobile accidents kill 
thousands of Americans every 
year, but instead of banning dri-
ving outright, the government 
regulates it by imposing speed lim -
its and traffic rules and licensing 
procedures . If the government 
outlawed driving, manic motor 
junkies racing in remote locations 
with no formal driving lessons or 
access to reliable vehicular mainte-
nance would be at a far greater risk 
of death by crashing than your 
average soccer mom driving her 
SUV 

The ri sk involved with illegal 
drugs is not just from their illegal 
status. However, we see from the 
examples of two legal drugs that it 
is a controllable danger. Today, cig-
arettes and alcohol are recognized 
to have se rious health conse-
quences, and alcohol in particular is 
recognized as the culprit for drunk-
en violence and careless driving. 
Despite this, the vast majority of 
the population using these sub-
stances does so without problems. 

tions concerning the hijab advocate 
in and of themselves, perhaps, that 
women such as McSally ought not 
to be required to wear the abaya : If 
Muslim men and women dress 
modestly out of love for and belief 
in the Quran, then for nonbelievers 
to do so would be misleading and 
inappropriate. 

In the end, it is important to 
realize that American arrogance 
cannot be extricated from the issue 
of Mc~ally's case before Congress 
and the Depanment of Defense. 

The drunk.1rds and the lung cancer 
victims are caused by abuse - by 
drinking too much or smoking too 
heavily. 

Given the government's interest 
in seeing drugs eliminated and 
given the addic ts' interest in sup· 
porting their drug of choice, it is 
very difficult to know with any cer-
tainty just how dangerous these 
drugs really are. I am not going to 
debate the safety of popular illegal 
drugs, or even question the severity 
of their negative effects. But we 
know for a fact that they do not kill 
you instantaneously, since we still 
have addicts running around all 
over the place. 

T here is a history of drug use 
before the bans that occurred at the 
beginning of the 20th century. 
Additionally, there is the modern 
example of countries such as 
Holland and Sweden, which hal'e 
yet to descend into an anarchy of 
rape and murder despite having 
provided legal access to m3 ny drugs 
to their citizens for many years. 
However, society won 't disinte-
grate with widespread and harmless 
drug use. 

The Americans stationed in Saudi 
Arabia are guests, nOt squatters and 
new rule-makers. They should 
treat the culture surrounding them 
with the respect that should be 
accorded to any host. MeSall y's vic-
tory protects the sovereignty of ser-
vicewomen in the face of an 
exploitative, hierarchical military, 
but nobody should projec t the 
West's own internal struggles with 
feminism onto a religious tradition 
that, many would argue, created 
feminism over 1.400 year .. ago.

6 OPINION THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY, MAY 23, 2002 

Rejection, reflection, and finally redemption 
Getting over rejection is a difficult but valuable experience 

A few weeks ago you may have 
noticed me on cam-
8us. No, I was not the 
'blonde bombshell 
walking flirtatiously on 
Library Walk," I was 
the one with the 
blood-shot eyes, mas-
cara-stained cheeks 
and deep frown lines, 
walking like a dazed 
zombie from class-
room to classroom. 

My dream had just been 
crushed. Actually, "crushed" really 
doesn't describe how I felt that 
day. Perhaps "obliterated" and 
"defeated" do my feelings at that 

time a little more justice. I" had 
just received news of my transfer 
application to UC Berkeley; I had 
been rejected. 

For months I had been build-
ing up the outcome of my transfer 
application in my head. During 
that time, I had made several trips 
to UC Berkeley (which perhaps 
made the eventual rejection a bit 
more bitter) and believed that get-
ting the acceptance letter would 
somehow transform me, make me 
a bener human being in my eyes 
and in the eyes of my family and 
friends . I would finally be able to 
convince myself I was "as good" as 
the students who go to UC 
Berkeley and that much closer to 
academic and social success. 

Even though I risk social per-
secution for writing this, I had 
always thought I was somehow 
"third-rate" for goi ng to UCSD. 
Whenever I told people I went to 
UCSD, they always retorted "Oh, 
you mean the party school?" I felt 
like people around me thought I 
was not as intelligent as some of 
my friends who got into the so-
ca ll ed "better" UC schools; 
UCLA and UC Berkeley. 

Even worse, I believed that I 
was not "good enough" or "smart 
enough" as the students there. My 
inferiority complex went so deep 
that I could not find anything J 
liked about UCSD. I hated my 
classes. I hated the school's envi-
ronment. I was suspicious of the

administration and wary of the 
students who were happy here . 

For six months, while I awaited 
news of my transfer status, I fanta-
sized about what I would do when 
I got into UC Berkeley. I would 
run for school president. I would 
meet a professor who would final-
ly help me unearth the meaning of 
life. I would write a research paper 
that would go on to win the 
undergraduate research award and 

eventually land me a spot in an Ivy 
League graduate school. And all 
this even though my grades were 
less than stellar (OK, a lot less 
than stellar). 

I somehow convinced myself 
that a higher power would con-
vince the admissions committee to 
let me in. I let myself believe that 
God, free on a 20-minute lunch 
break from trying to bring an end 
to terrorism and endless boy 
bands, would somehow influence 
those powerful committee mem-
bers to stamp "Approved!" on my 
application. Of course it was 
ridiculous, but that's what you do 
when you really, really want some-
thing; You feel like you deserve it. 

While waiting for UC 
Berkeley's decision, I had ample 
time to try to enjoy myself at 
UCSD. To involve myself more in 
school-related activities and work 
harder in my classes instead of 
thinkjng of new additions to my 
list of "1,001 things I hate about 
UCSD." 

Did I in fact do anything posi-
tive or productive while waiting 
for the committee's decision? Not 
really. I was terrified to think of

something I actually liked here 
because it meant that I belonged 
here - to a school I felt isolated 
from. And so, when I read the 
committee's decision that fateful 
day, I felt worthless and angry 
be}'ond words. I was stuck here at 
UCSD. I felt like a prisoner. 
(Except I was paying more than 
S I 0,000 for my period inside my 
jail ceiL) 

Thankfully, I had arranged a 
meeting with a school psycholo-
gist that day or you would have 
seen me running naked down 
Library Walk in protest of the 
admission committe's decision. 
(For anyone remotely excited by 
this prospect, I can assure you it 
would have been a horrific sight.) 

It just so happened I got an 
intelligent and rational "no-non-
sense individual" who was not 
going to sir there and listen to me 
whjne about how much I hated 
UCSD and the UC Berkeley 
admission board until her ears 
bled and she thought about leav-
ing the profession. 

Instead, she forced me to con-
front the fact that 1 was not going 
to die just because I gor rejected 
from UC Berkeley. She reminded 
me that everyone faces rejection 
at one point or another and tried 
to make me understand thar even 
if I got into UC Berkeley, I would 
not suddenly transform into a bet-
ter version of myself. I would just 
be me, Divya Runchal, insecure 
individual extraordinairc, at 
another universi ty. 

I left her office feeling frustrat-
ed and confused. She had asked 
me to meet up with her again in 
two weeks and think about what I 
liked about UCSD. At that 
moment there was nothing I liked 
about UCSD. 1 did not know how 
1 would survive until our next 
meeting. 

But I did. And because I 
thought I had nothing else to lose 
(considering I was at an extreme-
ly low point to begin with), I 
decided I would actually try to 
complete the assignment. [ began 
reading the books professors 
assigned for homework, instead of 
apathetically skimming through 
them like I usually did. And sur-
prise, surprise - I actually 
enjoyed them. I went to places 
around campus I would normally 
just pass by, and met interesting 
people while sipping coffee and 
taking in the view at the Grove 
Caffe or at the cafe outside 
Mandeville. 

I also began e-mailing profes-
sors and TAs, and attending office 
hours. I was shocked to learn that 
professors were interesting and 
genuinely nice people, rather 
than the stuffy, snobby intellectu-
als I had thought they were just 
weeks before. And although La 
Jolla may not be as intellectually 
or socially stimulating as I believe 
Berkeley to be, it is still a beauti-
ful place and the weather is not as 
temperamental as Northern 
California's. 

It is funny how feelings can 
change so quickly. When I was 
rejected, as crazy as it sounds, I 
thought my life was over. I felt 
like I would never become the 
successful or intelligent individual 
I thought all UC Berkeley stu-
dents are. I felt like a cantanker-
ous senior citizen who was fed up 
with life after having survived 
through the depression, a war and 
enough family drama to last more 
than a lifetime, except I was 020 
- and an ungrateful, spoiled brat 
who could not see the good things 
I al ready had access to. 

So, yes, I was devastated ami 
angry when I did not get into UC 
Berkeley. But to my surprise, I 
learned the importance of grati-
tude and rCJIlized that maybe 
UCSD is noc: . ~ .r.

ter semester," said BYU-Idaho 
Dean of Students Jim Sessions. 

"[Students are representatives of 
this university), thus we ask students 
to dress a little nicer and a little 
sharper while in that role. This pre-
cludes wearing attire that is overly 
casual or grubby," Sessions said. 

"The term 'casual' and 'grubby' 
become the key to the flip-flop 
issue. We would approve the wear-
ing of a flip-flop which is more 
dressy and has a higher quality 
appearance than the beach or 
shower flip-flop," he said. 

"Therefore, when you dress to 
come to campus, we ask that you 
compare yourself to a higher stan-
dard of conservative and more for-
ma! dress. We don't want to, and we 
can't stand at every door enforcing 

the guidelines," Sessions sajd. 
The admistration doesnt want to 

be over bearing. 
"We don't want to define all the 

don'ts," said BYU-Idaho Assistant 
Dean of Students Dean Cloward. 

The Code of Honor provides 
standards of dress and grooming. 
BYU, BYU-Hawaii and LDS 
Business College follow the same 
code, but within the honor code 
there is room for slight changes 
and each LDS university has 
unique dress standards to suit 
itself, Sessions said. 

BYU students in Provo, Utah, 
are allowed to wear flip-flops, said 
Steve Baker, director of the BYU 
Honor Code office. 

"We don't necessarily encour-
age flip-flops," Baker said. 

The variation in dress code is 
due to the schools' different mis-
sions, aCl;ording to Sessions. BYU 
is a four-year graduate research 
university. BYU-Idaho is a teach-
ing institution, Sessions said. 

"The guidelines and implemen-
tation of the principle [rules] can 
vary depending on the circum-
stances. What is fine for BYU may 
not be appropriate for BYU-I," 
Baker said.

New INS program will monitor 
foreign student enrollmen~ 
Internet-based 'Sevis' is set to begin in Jan., 
is expected to cut down on U.S. visa fraud 

(KR1) ST. PAUL, Minn. - A 
new program that electronically 
tracks foreign students as they 
enroll and study in the nation's 
colleges and universities was 
demonstrated Monday to higher 
education officials in Minnesota, 
many of whom work with these 
students at their schools. 

As early as January, the pro-
gram - dubbed "Sevis" - will 
replace the current paper process 
used by the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service. 

"Most of it is basic information 
we already work with," said 
Barbara Walters, an· international 
scholar coordinator at St. Olaf 
College in Northfield, Minn., 
who attended the demonstration. 
"Questions will come up, but it 
looks workable. I don't think any-
thing that is being reqwred is 
unreasonable. " 

The INS' tracking of foreign 
students has been under heavy 
scrutiny since Sept. II because 
some of the terrorists involved in 
the attacks on New York and 
Washington, D.C., were allowed 
to enter the United States on stu-
dent visas. The Justice 
Department, in a ISS-page report 
released this month, called the 
INS' current system "untimely 

and significantly flawed" and even 
raised questions about whether 
the new electronic system would 
be ready by a January 2003 dead-
line. 

In a statement released 
Monday, the INS said it fully 
intends to meet the deadline. 
Once the new system is in place, 
any school that accepts foreign 
students must use it. Congress 
provided S36.S million to the INS 
to make the change as part of the 
USA Patriot Act, and a proposal 
to charge a S95-per-student "user 
fee" is under consideration. 

Under the new system schools 
will be required to report a stu-
dent's failure to enroll. 

Under the current system, 
schools have no obligation to do 
this. Schools will also be required 
to report such information as the 
start date of a student's next 
semester, the dropping of a fuU 
course of study without approval, 
any disciplinary action taken 
because of a crime and earlier-
than-expected graduation. 

Under the new system it will 
be Internet-based, wruch should 
speed ' up information exchanges 
among schools and the govern-
ment. 

Under the current system, the 

exchange doesn't happen until a 
paper document is sent from one 
place to the next. 

It is expected to reduce visa 
fraud. 

Under the current system, stu-
dent visa forms are subject to theft 
and are often sold and used to 
support fraudulent visa applica-
tions. 

"Because it is faster, more 
accurate and secure, it will tighten 
up the lag time that made the old 
system not very workable," said 
INS spokesman lim Counts. 

Miguel Garate, who works 
with foreign students at Rjverland 
Community College in Austin, 
Minn., said he expects students 
may, at first, find the change to be 
a bit confusing and too personally 
demanding. 

"I hope international students 
don't get offended," Game said. 
"But it's for everybody'S own 
good. The more information you 
have, the better." 

The Justice Department and 
the INS track approximately one 
million foreign and exchange stu-
dents each year.

'Importance of 
Being Earnest' 
proves perplexing Contemporary percussion group, Red Fish Blue Fish, creates a unique sound 
Film adaptation of Oscar 
Wilde's beloved novel 
hits the theaters 
By JESSICA LONG 
Staff Writer 

It may be important to be Earnest, but who is Earnest? Well, since it comes out in the first 10 minutes of the 
movie, it won't hurt to tell now. No one 
is Earnest. Well, not really. The movie, 
which is based on the play by Oscar 
Wilde, has enough false and mistaken 
identities to be a Shakespearean comedy. 

Earnest starts out as the fictional 
younger brother of Jack Worthing 
(Colin Firth). Worthing creates him as 
an excuse to leave his country home and 
his young ward Cecily Cardew (Reese 
Witherspoon) . He also pretends to be 
Earnest while in the city visiting with his 
friend Algernon Moncrieff (Rupert 
Everett) while courting Gwendolen 
Fairfax (Frances O'Connor). 

Confused? There's more. Lady 
Braclcnell Gudi Dench), Gwendolen's 
mother, does not want her daughter 
marrying Jack Worthing (whom she 
believes is named Earnest Worthing), 
because of a question surrounding who 
his parents art. H owever, the head-
strong, lovesick Gwendolen refuses to 
accept her mother's decision and leaves 
the ci ty to find J ohn at his coun try 
home. 

To add to the confusion, Algernon 
decides to visitJohn at his country home 
pretending to be the fictional Earnest, 
meanwhile courting the imaginative 
Cecily. Then add to the mix Cecily's 
elderly, easily flustered governess Miss 
Prism (Anna Massey), who is being 
rather clumsily courted by the neighbor-
hood minister Dr. Chasuble (Tom 
Wilkinson). 

Of course, there are a few more twists 
and turns to the story, but in the end,

music department Web site. 

The popular ensemble is a 
barrage of sounds fused together 
to create a unique, musical 
experince. This is music that 
incorporates a wide range of 
styles and emotions. Melodies 
are constructed out of the vari-

instruments. Red Fish Blue Fish 
is known to put on unforgettable 
and energetic performances. 

Red Fish Blue Fish recently 
performed at the Bang on a

A stunning performance of the classic French play 'Tartuffe' 
Amid internal questions of religion, Moliere's once banned play receives a glowing response from audience 
By KEELY HYSLOP 
Staff writer 

The La Jolla Playhouse opened its 2002 season with a stunning production of Moliere's 
"Tartuffe." The play was per-
formed before a full house and the 
final curtain fell in the wake of a 
standing ovation. 

"Tartuffe," Moliere's most pop-
ular comedy, is the story of a clever 
"charlatan" who beguiles his way 
into the good graces of Orgon, the 
head of a wealthy French family. 
Through false religious piety and 
dramatic shows of devotion, he 
proceeds to wreak havoc in the 
Orgon family household . 

The play originally premiered 
unfinished for Louis XIV in 1664 
and was promptly banned until 
1669 for its controversial themes of 
religious hypocrisy. The play was 
originally written in French verse 
and was then translated by Richard 
Wilbur into rhymed English cou-
plets of iambic pentameter. 

The staging of the performance 
is magnificent, with various ele-

ments of special effects, comic tim-
ing, sound, lighting and strong per-
formances by skillfully cast actors 
all coming together in a beautifully 
unified artistic work. It is very illus-
trative of the careful attention to 
detail and respect for craft, which 
the La Jolla Playhouse is famous for 
espousing. 

The performance of the cast 
can be categorized as nothing 
short of flawless. Jefferson Mays is

REVIEW 

both hilarious and eerily resonant 
in his roll as Tartuffe. ~ Dionne, 
the smart and saucy lady's maid, 
Paget Brewster is wonderfully 
expressive and true to her charac-
ter. 

There is an interesting juxtapo-
sition between the period authentic 
costuming and the odd surrealism 
of the set design. The aesthetics 
add a dimension and texture to the 

production, making the play seem 
anything but old and tired. 

The acting is ultra-stylized to 
the point that every motion of the 
character seems carefully choreo-
graphed, and every syllable uttered 
seems weighted by hours of 
methodical rehearsal. 

The visual effect is that of view-
ing actors portraying actors por-
traying characters, which, though 
farcical, seems to create a conspicu-
ous element of distance between the 
human elements of the story and 
the perceptions of the audience. 
The intentional caricatures seem to 
dominate the production to such an 
extent that the underlying message 
that the piece is trying to communi-
cate becomes nebulous. 

Theater encompasses two main 
facets: to put on a show and to tell a 
story that communicates something 
to the audience. "Tartuffe" elicits 
from its audience a clear sense of 
admiration for the performers and a 
somewhat confused sense of pur-
pose for the production. 

The play was followed by a 
heavy shadow of theatrical subtext,

at times seeming like an ongoing 
inside joke to which the audience 
was only privy to morsels of the 
punch line. 

The show is wonderfully done, 
but may leave the viewer somewhat 
dissatisfied, with the taste of unan-

swered questions sti ll on the 
tongue. 

'Tartuffe' runs through May 19 at the 
La Jolla Playhouse. For more informa-

Higb energy from Dave Matthews 
Over 20,000 embraced Dave Matthews Band at Coors

gave out a lot of energy. The whole band 
seemed delightcd to be playing live. Dave

out the whole performance and his voice was 
captivating throughout the how. 

Boyd Ttnsley was amazing on thc violin 
and his solos provided some of the most pow-
erful moments of the show. Stefan Lessa rd 
was great on bass and his solos were also a 
wonderful addition to the program. LeRoi 
Moore, who played th e saxophone, was the 
least animated of thc group, however this did 
not rellect poorly on his sou nd. arter 
Beauford on the drums was also a rcmarkable 
part of the show and really pushed the encr· 
gy level higher with his powerful sound. 

The highlight of the show was the band's 
rendi tion of "\Nhere Are You Goi ng?," 
which will be the band's next single. The 
audience already knew the song and loved to 
hea r it live. "All Along the Watchtower" was 
also another great live performance. The

Take a look at upcoming DVDs 
'Vanilla Sky' provides 
lackluster mystery 
By ED WU 
Senior Staff Writer 

Cameron Crowe's Hollywood adapta-tion of "Abre los Ojos," a stellar and intriguing Spanish film, features 
Penelope Cruz reprising her role as the 
dream woman of a rich and incompetent 
business mogul, played by Tom Cru ise. 

Cruise 's character inherits his father's 
publishing empire and spends his days 
driving around with his friends and diffi-
dently having sex with his love toy 
Cameron Diaz. 

As Cruise's sins catch up with him, the 
movie turns into an intellectual - if some-
what intellectuall y pretentious 
thri ller/art film that is both confusing and 
amazing. 

The DVD's crisp 
quality does the beautiful 
visuals justice, but the 
extra features incl uded 
are mediocre at best. T he 
behind-the-scenes fea-
tures that show the 
movie's production and subsequent press 
tour are barely cohesive collages that are 
little more than eye candy, while Crowe's 
commentary is simplistic and generaliz-
ing, providing remarkably little insight 
into this marvelously rich movie. 

Other featu res include the prerequisite 
theatrical trai ler and associated music 
video, but the real gift is the set photos by 
Neal Preston, who beautifully captured 
key instants of the film, as well as random 
nonfilming moments showing the human-
ity of the actors involved in the project. 
But ultimately, these are little help in 
deciphering an immensely complex and 
interesting film. 

Overall, the DVD offers little more 
than a clear showing of the film, bur that 
alone is worth it. "Vanilla Sky" is a snln-
ning and beautiful movie visually, musical-
ly and intellectually. Unless you don't feel 
like thinking, that is. 

legend' turns out to be 
a hoax of a good DVD 
By BRENT HECHT 
Staff Writer 

Considering DVD's advances in color accuracy, the unicorns feanlred in the "Legend: Ultimate Edition" DVD 
should not appear so yellow that they look 
like they rolled in their own urine prior to 
galloping gracefully on camera . 

Indeed, color infidelity is the primary 
crime of this two-disc DVD set, aimed at 
members of the growing "Legend" cult. 
Main ly at fault is a white-balance that is 
bruta lly biased toward yell ows. 

1bis is an especially large problem (at 
least to the more anal DVD fan) consider-
ing the fi lm's plot traces mrs Tom Cruise

ness. 
Fortunately, the highly 

intell igent content of the 
DVD's special features by 
and large outweigh the 
errors in presentation. 
Most notably, in his full-

length audio commentary, director Rid ley 
Scott omits constant discussion of oock-
stage foibles, rightfully choosing instead to 
highl ight the immense effort that went 
into producing this modern fairy tale with-
Out any computer-generated effects. 

T he other special features, which 
include a making-of documentary, just-
recovered lost scenes and the director's cut 
of the film, also reflect the filmmaking tal-
ent of Scott and his crew. 

Although the color accuracy problems 
with the "Legend: Ultimate Edition" two-
disc DVD set are noticeable even to the 
average DVD fan, so is the intelligence 
and high quality behind many of the set's 
special features. As such, the target audi-
ence of the set - the film's cultish fan base 
- will definitely want to plunk down their 
cash. Other movie fans, unless interested 
in Scott's work or the urinary tract of one-
horned animals, should stick with a rental. 

Chris Kattan's unfunny performance goes hi-tech 
By CHARLIE TRAN 
Hiatus Editor 

In another attempt by a "Saturday Night Live" alumni to make the jump to the big screen, comedian Chris Kanan stars in 
the low-brow, tasteless comedy "Cor ky 
Roman o." 

Kattan plays an assistant veterinarian 
who is brought back into 
his Mafia fa mily to infil-
trate the FBI and destroy 
evidence that could be 
Ilsed against his father. 

Everything seems 
rushed and contrived, as 
ifKattan didn't know any better than to play 
one of his annoying characters from SNL. 
His comedic setup is just too overbearing 
and ul timately makes him look like Mr. 
Peepers gone amok for an hour-and-a-half. 

T he plot isn't the only thing that's dumb 

about this movie : Just about everything in 
this movie is cliched and nothing is funn y. 

The only thing left to ponder when the 
credits roll is how could a movie that horri-
ble be made? Even worse, how could a movie 
like "Corky Romano" be made into 3 DVD? 

The DVD has onl y the basics: the fil m, a 
few extended scenes and a behind-the-
scenes fea turette. For a film that steals one-

DVD 
REVIEWS 

and-a-half hours &om 
your life, there certainly 
isn't much that the DVD 
can do to make the film 
any better. 

The extended scenes 
just make the already-bad 

scenes even worse, and the featurette does-
n't really add any more. In fact, the behind-
the-scenes clips just show Kattan acting in a 
scene; nothing is gained from their viewing. 

With a fi lm this bad, don't even bother 
touching it.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN HIATUS 13 

'Insomnia' keeps audiences wide awake 
Robin Williams delivers an uncharacteristicly tormented perfor-
By DAVID BYNUM 
Staff Writer 

" Insomnia" has created as 
much buzz in Hollywood in 
the past few months as 

Anheuser-Busch did at UCSO's 
Sun God festival. Starring AI 
Pacino, Robin Williams and 
Hillary Swank, the film is the direc-
torial foll ow-up to Christopher 
Nolan's sleeper hit, "Memento." 

The film follows two LAPD 
detectives to Alaska to rake on a 
bizarre murder case that removes 
them from the hea t of Los 
Angeles, where internal affairs 
investigations are shaking th.ings 
up at their department. 

An argument between Will 
Dormer (Pacino) and his partner, 
as well as a police death in pursuit 
of the lead suspect, take Dormer 
and the audience on a suspenseful 
and sleepl ess journey that juxtapos-
es the corruption of big-city police 
with small-town cops. 

It leaves Dormer searching for 
the difference between right and 
wrong. The viewers follow 
Dormer as he walks in the gray 
area that separates a defender of 
the peace from a dirty cop. 

Film 
REVIEW 

Pacino's performance in the 
film is strong, but by no means is it 
a standout in his career. He IS 
afforded a few instances to let his 
trademark squelch go, but other-
wise the script doesn 't demand 
much of Pacino. The majority of 
his acti ng deals with a combination 
of insomnia and inner conflict. 

This can be said of his work: 
He took the part as far as it could 
go, and it is hard to imagi ne some-
one who could have played the 
pan better. 

Swank's part as a hometown 
Alaskan cop was also not very 
dem anding of an actress wh o 
recently won an Oscar. 

Williams plays the part of a 
mentally tormented writer and 
doesn't appear until about halfway 
through the film. This part was 
great for Williams, who unfortu-
nately had a hard time being 
unlikable on screen . "V11O else 
could follow up playing a mental -
ly tormented child entertai ner 

("Death To Smoochie") in a dark 
comedy by playing a reclusive 
murderer in a crime film? 

The film 's true star is the 
Alaskan setting. Nolan i~ able to 
incorporate the setting's beauty into 
his thematic ideas delightfully. He 
is able to offer an inreresting look ~t 
what insonmia is like by combining 
const~nt daylight with Pacinos ~ct­
ing and some clever editi ng work. 

It would be nearly impossible to 
live up to the hype urrounding the 
film. "Insomnia" may have done 
just that. It hits on all cylinder~, 
creating suspense effectively amid 
great acting and beauti ful direction 
while si multaneously exploring the 
crime genre's favo rite theme: 
deceit. "Insomnia" should please 
all but tho e who go into the film 
expecting that it will be able to cap-
italize on all of the ta lent 11m sur-
rounded the project.

Down 
II 

Elektra 

*** 
For those familiar with 

the NOLA scene (New 
Orleans, Louisiana heavy 
metal), then you would 
need no introduction to 
bayou super group Down. 

Comprised of members 
from Pantera, Corrosion of 
Conformity and Crowbar, 
the music is pretty much 
what you would expect to 
hear from a jam of said 
bands. 

Another Pantera mem-
ber is present on this. 
album; if you had any expo-
sure to Down from its first 
abum back in 1995, you 
might remember mat 
noise-band Eyehategod 
was also present. Down IT 
finds Pantera bassist Rex 
Brown (an admitted Texan) 
"playing the dog shit" out 
of the four string. 

Since I haven't heard 
the much-celebrated first 
album, I was highly antici-

pating a southern fried 
sludge sound, but it's dis-
appointingly formulaic . 
Going the way of most 
not-50- uper super groups, 
Down delivers a well-pro-
duced, solid album that is 
rather predicable. 

The bands involved 
each have a distinct sound, 
and Down has the odd feel 
of trying to preserve these 
individual elements rather 
than letting something 
entirely new form. Down II 
is the musical postcard of 
NOLA: Not the best, not 
the most interesting, but 
something you can send 
your friends in some other 
part of the country - like 
Oregon - and give them 
an idea what the New 
Orleans sound is like. 

Hardcore fans of 
Pantera will probably be 
the most energized by 
Down's second album. 
Lead singer Phil Anselmo's 
vocal work is a trademark, 
and for a lcick he also plays 
guitar. Metal fans might 
want to pass, unless you're 
into all these groups and 
have found yourself sitting 
at home with a six-pack of 
Pabst and several joints 
thinking, "If only there was 
a way to get all the best 
sounds of New Orleans 
together." In that case, by 
all means, be my guest. For 
the rest of us ... m'eh.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

album 

Sheryl Crow 
C'mon ('mon 

A&M 

*** 
On "C'mon C'mon" 

Sheryl Crow is trying to 
evoke the classic rock sound 
of some of her early male 
rock heroes, inlcuding Steve 
Miller, Peter Frampton and 
Lynrd Skynrd. 

For "C'mon C'mon," 
Crow enlisted the emo-
tional support and voices 
of such famous friends as 
Don Henley, Emmylou 
Harris, Liz Phair, Natalie 
Maines of the Dixie Chicks 
and Lenny Kravitz. 

It's odd tha t Crow felt 
that the song "C'mon 
C'mon" was representative 
of the entire album 
because while it proves to 
be less sparse and twangy 
than most of the material 
from the "Globe Sessions," 
the song - with its piano 
and accordion - is more 
reminiscent of her 1998 
release. This effect may 
have something to do with 

• reviews 
Crow's collaboration with 
Stevie Nicks, who greatly 
influenced much of Crow's 
earlier work. 

While many of the songs 
arc intended to rock hard, 
they turn out more like 
accidental pop ditties. The 
classic breakup song "Over 
You," whose elements seem 
to blend better than those 
on most of the other tracks, 
tries to be a decent pop song 
and succeeds. 

"Soak up the Sun," the 
first single off the album, 
reflects Crow's growth as 
an artist and came after 
some advice from fri~nd 
and The Pretenders' front 
woman Chrissie Hynde 
about appreciating the 
simple things. 

"It's so Easy" was co-
written by Crow's sister and 
performed as a duet with 
Don Henley. The song, at a 
three-four tempo, is techni-
cally a waltz and proves to 
be the most country track 
on the album. 

It seems that Crow 
intended "C'mon C'mon" 
to rock harder than it actu-
ally does. The album has a 
classic hard rock vibc, but 
with subdued guitars and 
an overreliance on guest 
star musicians, it fails to 
really rock. But that's fine, 
because once again, Crow 
is doing what she does best: 
mellow, evocative pop rock.

Maladroit 

Geffen 

**** 
To the pleased surprise 

of Weezer fans every-
where, the band has 
released ' another album. 
Weezer's fourth album, 
"Maladroit," comes on the 
heels of the commerically 
successful "Green Album." 

Weezer fans who were 
thirsty for anything 
released by Weezer now 
have more than they want. 
The CD also contains 
seven video clips, which 
are mostly from live shows, 
and the 13 tracks of music 
are the most Weezer has 
ever had on an album. 

1rhe songs on 
"Maladroit" have guitar 
crunches and hooks that 
are similar to the "Green 
Album," but their recent 
effort lacks the summer-
like feeling found on 
"Island in the Sun" or the 
singable chorus on "Hash 
Pipe." The album is geneT-

everyone's identity is revealed and 
they all set our to live happily ever 
after. 

Overall the acting is fair, though 
not spectacular. Everett does a 
decent job as the "dandy" Algernon 
who likes to live it up while running 
out of money. Firth doesn't fare so 
well playing Jack, considering Jack 
pretends to be Earnest so that he 
can escape his life as Jack. Firth 
does a poor job creating a lively city 
personality for his character. 

the fantastic moments of their 
romance. O'Connor did a wonder-
ful job as the spunky, detemlined 
Gwendolen who can't quite escape 
her overbearing mother. And Dench 
does a satisfactory job playing Lady 
Bracknell, a socialite who despite 
her humble beginnings, has a great 
deal of concern over her daughter'S 
marrying into a good family. 

Dench's costumes alone are 
almost enough to make seeing the 
whole movie worthwhile . Her 
dresses are extravagantly overdone 
with frills, ribbons, ruffles aDd 
bows. Her hats look as though 
someone planted a rose garden on 
her head. The costumes are won-
derful and truly bring her character 
to life. 

The humor throughout the 
movie is rather entertaining, how-
ever there are a few moments when 
the jokes fall flat. The scenes pok-
ing fun at how silly the women in 
the movie act tend to be drawn out 
and detract from O'Connor's oth-
erwise strong character. 

The movie is enjoyable and def-
. initely a fun way to spend the after-
noon, especially if you have a date. 
Of co urse, to quote Algernon, 
"The essence of romance is uncer-
tainty. "

ally darker, but neverthe-
less well-crafted . 

Nearly all of the songs 
remain under three min-
utes long, -but there is a 
great deal of motion and 
texture to the songs. The 
minimalistic lead guitar 
work in the "Green 
Album" is replaced by 
sharp, techincal lead parts 
evident In tracks 
"American Gigolo" and 
"Dope Nose." 

"Most everyone hated 
the solos on the 'Green 
Album, ' or lack thereof," 
stated Weezer front man 
Rivers Cuomo. "At tirst I 
tried to ignore (the fan 
reactions), to argue with 
them or defend myself, but 
evenrually I realized, you 
know what? Those solos 
did suck. I should try hard-
er on the next album." 

The effort shows. 
"BurndtJamb" captures 

the summery melody of 
"Island in the Sun" but 
explodes into a fury of dis-
torted guitars. Cuomo had 
spent his teen years listen-
ing to KISS, and the influ-
ence of his roots shows in 
"Maladroit" with the big 
guitar sounds and huge 
riffs that will get almost 
anyone to follow along 
with their air guitars. 

"Maladroit" is another 
step in the constantly 
evolving sound of Weezer.

Witherspoon's performance as 
Cecily was also disappointing as she 
portrayed her character to be one-
dimensional. She also lacked any 
chemistry with Everett, even during 

The cast plays off each other 
well throughout the movie and .the 
contrast between the characters 
brought them all to life in a charm-
ing way.

18 PORTS THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY, MAY 23, 2002 

UCSD~l~~SPORTS: YEAR IN REVIEW 
SKI & SNOWBOARD 

The UCSD ski and snowboard team 
~ea~on ended with the team taking first 
place in the overalliengue standings for the 
second consecuti"e year, followed by UC 
Santa llJrbJra and USc. 1ne men's and 
women 's ski team also took first place over-
all for the ~ccond year in a row, followed by 
UC Santa Barbara and Cal Poly. The mcn's 
and women's snowboard team barcly 
trussed ccond place and ended lip third 
place overall - finishing behind both 
UCSB and Cal State Long Beach. 

For the snowboard team individual sea-
son performance, female snowboarder Amy 
Sage took first place in women's giant 
slalom, first place in women's boardercross 
and first place in overall women's com-
bined. Freshman Biliana Veleva took sec-
ond place in women's giant slalom and sec-
ond place in overall women's combined 
scoring. Freshman Amanda Vlasveld took 
fourth place in women's boardercross. 

Stan Wu took sixth place in men's giant 
slalom, first place for men's boardercross, and 
third place in the overall combined score. 

Sage went to the United States 
Collegiate Snowsport Association 
Nationals for the fourth year in a rowand, 
as expected, took first place in the snow-
board boardercross, first place in the giant 
slalom, and once again took the title of the 
No. I female collegiate snowb02rder in the 
nation. Even though Sage was the only 
racer for UCSD at the national competi-
tion, she singlehandedly qrought a third-
place victory for the UCSD snowboarders 
in overall team standings. 

For the slci team individual season perfor-
mance, freshman Sierra Bourne took second 
place in the women's giant slalom, first place 
in the women's slalom and first place in the 
overall women's combined scoring. 

Sophomore DanieUe Crockett took first 
place in women's giant slalom, second place 
in the women's slalom, Erst place in the 
women's slciercross and second place in the 
overall women's combined scoring. 

Junior Tom Christensen took fourth 
place in the mens slalom and fourth place in 
the overall mens combined scoring. Senior 
and team captain Thvis Ritchie took sixth 
pl2cc in the overall combined men's scoring 
followed closely by senior and team president 
CoUin Casper, who finished seventh in the 
overall men's combined scoring. 

This season, UCSD sent five skiers to the 
regional competition as well, and although 
none of the five was able to advance, they 
proved to the rest of the conference they 
would be seriOIlS competition next season. 

MEN'S LACROSSE 

The UCSD men's lacrosse team came 
into the season as one of the nation's up-and-
coming teams, having broken intO the 
United States Lacrosse Intercollegiate 
Association top 25 for the first time in uni-
versity history. Ambitiously they took on one 
of the most difficult schedules in the nation, 
which included six of the top-10 teaIns in the 
nation. 

Team character was tested cady as four 
projected ~tarters chose to forego the sea-
son, two of whom were preseason USLIA 
All-Americans. These changes and unfor-
tunale injuries forced the team to use dif-
ferent offensive and defensive schemes th:1I1 
it had in the past. 

The tcam struggled to trust the new 
concepts of ball possession and total team 
dcfcn c. T he turning point came during 
the National Lacrosse Showcase 
Tournament against defending national 
champion Colorado State. 

The Ram '., loaded with offensive fire-
power, wert: c rt.~inJy the Goliath ofUSLIA 
Lacrossc. UC D showed no fear and played 
Colorado tJtc to overtime. Although 
UCSD fell 11-7 in the overtime period, the 
game turned the season around for UCSD 
[lOd thrust the team into the national spot-
light Fonz Ikeda, UCSD's version of 
'yraL'llSe'S Mikey Powell, had two goals and 

two assists in the game. Jake Lowenstein, 
who proved to be a wall aU year in goal for 
UCSD, brought the crowd to its feet lvith a 
dominating 18-save performance. 

UCSD recorded wins against the likes 
of San Diego State, Arizona State and 
University of San Diego. Against the ninth-
ranked Colorado Buff.tloes, UCSD finally 
put together the game it had the potential

to play. Midfielders Arjun Maldonado, 
Matt LaFiandra and Phil Smith had brea.lc-
through games and gave UCSD the mid-
field presence that they needed, combining 
for six goals and thr~ assists. The defense 
shut down the powerful Buffaloes behind 
great play of the big three, Brian Bardellini , 
Joe Rotter and Chrjs Washington. 

UCSD finished the regular season strong 
with a dismantling of Loyola Marymount. 
Needing a win to clinch playoffs, UCSD beat 
the Lions 11-6. Team captain Michael 
Hunter. Maldonado, Lafiandra and Stensrud 
sizzled the nets in an offensive display. David 
Butler played brilliantly ODce again and 
wreaked havoc for LMU's offense. 

The future also looks blight for UCSD, 
as the team created a developmental squad 
to groom future stars. Nash Collins, Brett 
Williams, Matt Rotz and Ron Orrungroj 
were among those who raised their games 
tremendously during the year. 

Hunter finished the year among the 
league leaders in both points and assists, 
while Lowenstein proved himself to be one 
of the best goalies on the West Coast. 
Watch out for this team in 2002-2003. 

WOMEN'S LACROSSE 

Approaching the 2002 season as a 
rebuilding year, the women's lacrosse team 
got exactly what it WlInted out of its play, 
despite finishing with a 2-10 record. 

Coach Derek Wiback brought the team 
back to the basics of solid game play, and 
taught hard work and dedication to the 
sport. The team looked at games as ways to 
learn how to improve play and how to 
remain competitive against other schools, 
which it did well, always fighting to the end. 

The team was led by seniors Maggie 
Scales, Pilar Apalisok, Lacy Hatfield and 
Lindsey Sutliff. Apalisok, Scales, Megan 
Wemmer and Anna Sunseri were all recog-
nized via nomination for the Women's 
vVestern Lacrosse League All-Star Team. 

SAILING 

The UCSD sailing team finished its 2002 
season in style. The team's final sailing event 
was the Pacific Coast Championships, in 
which the team finished eighth overall 
among teams that are consistently ranked in 
the top-20 sailing teaIDS in dle narion. 

Not only did the team place well, but it 
also placed well in Hawaii under treacher-
OIlS sailing conditions. The placing was all 
the more impressive considering UCSD 
was one of only two uncoached teams com-
peting at the PCC regatta. 

The team consistently placed around the 
fifth-place mark in all of its regattas for the 
season (with the exception of the final PCC 
event). This is due to a marked increase in 
the number of competitors UCSD was able 
to have competing at each sailing event for 
the year. Also, R) Ward and Kim Leung 

scored higher in their regional regattas than 
they ever had before, including a second-
place finish in the " A" Race at the Rose 
Bowl Intersectional Regatta, one of the 
most prestigious races in the country. 
Skipper ' Ryan McDonell also vastly 
improved his performance throughout the 
year. 

ICE HOCKEY 

The UCSD ice hockey team started the 
2001-2002 season by taking a big risk. 
UCSD became a member of the American 
Collegiate Hockey Associ2tion, a league 
including teams from all around the couD-
try and feaMing the opportunity to com-
pete for a national tide. 

Being members of both the ACHA and 
Pacific Collegiate Hockey Association 
meant playing almost twice the number of 
games than UCSD had played in its previ-
ous season. The team knew a challenge lay 
ahead and responded with an extremely 
tough training regimen. 

The addition of several new players gave 
UCSD the depth it would need to grind 
OUt its heavy schetiule. 

Most notably, freshman Kevin Davis 
arrived to complete the famed "Davis 
Line," already consisting of his brothers 
Chris Davis and Keith Davis. This offen-
sive line was responsible for almost 60 per-
cent of the team's goals production 
throughout the season. 

The sophomore line of Elliot 
Mendelsohn, Stephen Cohen and Andrew 

eoonm File PhoIo 
Celebr.tion: The UCSD ice hockey team 
enjoyed another successful season this year. 

Jacobsen provided a constant attack that 
kept other teams on their toes. The trio of 
Scott Andersen, Rich Hsiao and Will 
Thomas pWlished opponents in the corners 
and proved to be a pestering group. 

Chris 1bn and OJ. Alcaraz filled Ottt 
the offcnsive lines when they were called 
L1pon in key situations. The defensive core 
of Garen Gervey, Erik Borman, Case)' 
Kempner and Brerr Cowan controlled the 
front of the UCSD net with the help of 
newcomers Andrew Guiterrez, Ben Terris, 
Jason Steiner and Rich Ahroon. Along 
with the help of their defense man, the 
goaltcnding duo of Scott Fricdman and 
Sean Fine helped to stifle offenses. 
Coaches Peter Chu and Reid Hankins 
made sure that the team was ready to put in 
the effon it would need for its upcoming 
season. 

T he season began against Stanford 
University. UCSD lost its first game to 
Stanford 4-3 in a shoot-out but recovered 
quickly to beat them the next night 11-2. 
UCSD IlScd this opening weekend as a 
springboard into a 12-game winning streak 
including victories against SDSU, UC 
Berkeley, UCLA and Long Beach State. The 
team continued its winning ways throughout 
the season but the heavy schedule seemed to 
wear the team down near the end. 

UCSD finished the season as the second 
seed in the West Division of the ACHA and 
was invited to its first ACHA National 
Tournament in Alpharetta, Ga. Despite beat-
ing the University of Georgia, 5-3, in ilS first 
game, UCSD lost to Muskeegon College of 
M.ichigan and finished the tournament 
ranked sixth in the nation. 

UCSD learned &001 its experiences in 
Georgia at the ACHA Nationals to come out 
hard and fut in the PCHA Championship 
Tournament a month later in Valencia, Calif. 
With victories over UC Davis and Fresno 
State. the UCSD ice hockey team left the ice 
with a third-consecutive PCHA 
Championship under its collective belt. 

For the 1002-2003 season, the te3m is 
already scheduled to play such powerhous-
es as UCLA, Utah State, University of 
Wyoming and Palmer University. UCSD 
has been in contact with almost 30 prospec-
tive players fOI next season and hopes to

The 2001-2002 season didn't go as well 
as the UCSD men's rugby team hoped it 
would. Last year, the team closed things out 
with a record of 1-7 and was hoping to 
improve upon that record. Unfortunately, 
the 2-6 record was not quite the amount of 
improvement UCSD was loolci.ng for. 

However, this seasonal storm cloud does 
have .its silver lining. Injuries on the UCSD 
bench have resulted in over half of the team's 
15 sruters, consisting of first- or second-
year players, four of whom are freshmen. 

First-year players Mike Meissner and Ben 
Kanner started early on, already showing 
great'leadership potential on the team, with 
first-year Mike Polsky leading the way on the 
field with his quick feet. Second-year Nick 
Serrato put his impressive frame to good lise 
throughout the year, coming through time 
after time with bone-crushing hj ts. All in all, 
things are loolcing up for men's rugby. 

EQUESTRIAN 

The UCSD equestrian team came at 
this season with a fresh approach, aided by 
new coach Lynn Bolunger and twO new 
captains, Stacy Sakai and Lisa Calvi no. The 
tracks this team took throughout the season 
helped develop a team championship and 
several reserve championships. 

That team championship was the team's 
high point for the season as UCSD beat out 
aU comers at the USD show by a whopping 
to-point margin. 

Four of the team's riders qualified for 
regionals at Cal Poly Pomona: Calvina for 
Open Fences, Sakai for Inrermediate Flat, 
Morgan Messing and ZoeJarocki for Novice 
Flat. Calvino and Sakai placed high enough 
to advance to Zone Competitions in Reno, 
Nev. There, Calvino took fourth in open 
fences and Sakai took first in intennediate 
flat, which advanced her to Nationals in 
Cazenovia, N.Y., where she took 1) th place.

this competition. 

"This is a significant break-

Pinkerton said.

According to her, next year 
should see some electrifying 
results. 

"Our lightweights have 
always been competitive, and 
they're a really young team, so 
next year will be very exciting,"

Year Ronalda, the Brazilians will 
look to use "the beautiful game" to 
win their fifth tide. Joining 
Ronalda on what is always an excit-
ing outfit, are Rivaldo, Roberto 
Carlos and Ronaldinho. Unlike the 
Argentineans, the Brazilians got 
the weakest draw of the tourna-
ment, joining first-timers Turkey 
and China along with Costa Rica in 
Group C. 

France is the European favorite 
to win it all. With a potent attack 
and solid defense, the defending 
champs have a good chance to 
repeat. Zincdine Zidane, two-time 
world player of the year, will be the 
catalyst to the attack while Patrick 
Viera will look to hold the team 
together in the midfield. Clouding 
France's prospects is a knee injury 
to striker Thierry Henry, one of 
France's star forwards . 

The final contender is Italy, 
which many experts predict will be 
the surprise winner of the tourna-
ment. Led by veteran Paolo 
Maldini, the Italians arc in the 
same group as Croatia, Mexico and 
Ecuador. Italy features a potent 
attack force of Allesandro Del 
Piero, Christian Inzaghi and 
Francesco Totti. Grouped with 
Croatia, Ecuador and Mexico, the 
Azzul'i may have some problems 
getting out of the first round, but if 
they do they are as tough as any 
team in the tournament.

team bonding and excitement it 
produced."

boats of four to the races. The var-
sity four finished fourth III the

Like the NCAA basketball 
tournament, the World Cup is 
often about the underdog who 
overachieves throughout the tour-
nament. Who will be this year's 
Cameroon of 1990) One option is 
China. Grou ped with Braz.i l, the 
Chinese are definitely fighting for 
second place with Turkey and 
Costa Rica. China is cQached by 
the eccentric Bora Mulitinovic, 
who has never failed to lead a 
team to the second round of the 
World Cup - Costa Rica in 1990, 
the United States in 1994 and 
Nigeria in 1998.

Cameroon may provide a 
Cinderella story. As the only

\Vhile much of the American 
sporting world is focusmg on the 
;\iBA pbyoffs, the NIIL playoffs or 
'\Lljor League Baseball, the rest of 
the world is qllletiy preparing for 
the world's mo t-,,,ltched sporting 
event. 

T he 2002 FIFA \Vorld Cup 
beglll~ in a week, and for those less-
than-knowledgeable, and those 
who don't WJnt to stay up until 2 
a.llI . watching soccer, here is a pre-
view. 

The World Cup is scheduled to 

run from .\1ay 3 1 through June 25 
with two countries, Japan and 
South Korea, hosti ng for the first 
time. 

The 2002 competition will fea-
nlre 32 teams in eight groups of 
four, with round-robin play to 
determine the top twO finishers 
who advance to the second round. 
From there, the 16 teams will be 
bracketed into a single-leg knock-
out tournament to determine soc-
cer's world champion. 

1\venty-nine of the 32 partici-
pants made it to soccer's biggest 
stage after tough continental quali-
fying. The other three spots were

World Cup, U.S . head coach Bruce

Men's crew competes in nationals in New Jersey 
Varsity eight finishes last, novice eight grabs eighth 

Tritons fail 
to qualify 
for nationals 

By OWEN MAIN 
Staff Writer 

UCSD men 's crew flew cross-
country to New Jersey to race in 
the Avaya Division II National 
Championships from May 10 to 
May II . The regatta, which con-
sisted of both collegiate and 
international crews, included 
some of the rop non-scholarship 
crews in the country. The 
Tritons entered boats in two 
divi sions: varsity eight and 
novice eight. 

Racing in view of 6,000 fans, 
the Triton varsity team got an 
idea of how they measure up to 
the best in the country. 

"We've had good speed early 
in the year," said UCSD coach 
Michael Filippone. 

But the Tritons had a hard 
time keeping up. 

In their first heat, the Triton 
men finished fifth, .98 seconds 
behind fourth-place Virginia. 
The low result in the heat forced 

UCSD into the third-level final 
race. 

Against other crews who fin-
ished fifth and sixth in their 
respective heats, UCSD had a 
forgettable final race. Stroking 
against a strong headwind, the 
Tritons crossed the line as the 
sixth and final crew. Their time 
of 6:32 .6 was 13 seconds behind 
third-level champion Gonzaga 
and 18th overall out of 18 
teams. 

"There was some incredibly 
fast racing," Filippone said. 
"Our goal is to see what real 
speed is and to try to get to that 
level. The level of rowing there 
was much higher [then we're 
used to) ." 

With the varsity eight strug-
gling, the novice eight looked 
like it would struggle too. In its 
first heat, the boat got grouped 
with powerhouse Michigan and 
with rival Orange Coast 
College. 

With the Wolverine boat well 

ahead, the battle was between 
UCSD and OCC for second 
place and a chance to reach the 
championship final. The race 
came down to the line where the 
Pirates from Orange Coast fin-
ished .04 seconds ahead of 
UCSD, sending the Tritons to 
the peti te fi nal. 

In the petite final, the novice 
squad finished in second place 
with a time of 6:36.85; three sec-
onds behind petite champion 
Ithaca. The second-place show-
ing gave them an eighth-place 
finish out of 18 overall crews. 

"By participating in an event 
like this, we are bringing UCSD 
crew to another level," Filippone 
said. "These are some of the 
fastest crews in the country and 
we showed that we have compa-
rable speed. This is another step 
toward our goal of making 
UCSD a powerhouse in this 
sport." 

Coming off its journey to the 
Garden State, UCSD didn't have

much time to recover before tak-
ing five boats to Sacramento last 
weekend for the Pac-10 
Championships. 

On Lake Natoma, the second 
novice eight crew stole the show, 
pulling away from the field in the 
final 800 meters and winning the 
gold medal. The crew included 
coxswain Angela Lew, stroke 
Kevin Murphy, Ian Patrick, David 
Breslauer, Brian McNamara, 
Cameron Hand, Josh Emerson, 
Jon McCoy and Greg Moore at 
bow. 

"These are a bunch of great 
guys who have been training real-
ly hard together for the past two 
weeks," Filippone said of his sec-
ond novice team. 

The varsity eight crew didn't 
have such good luck. 

In their heat, the Tritons 
came in dead last, which put 
them in the petite final where 
they came out smoking, holding 
the lead for the majority of the 
race. But in the final 1,000 
meters they faltered and finished 
the race fourth. 

"There was some turmoil the 
day before we left f~r the race," 
Filippone said. "We lost our 
stroke oar the day before the race, 
and that's hard for any crew to 
recover from." 

The novice eight didn't have 
much luck either, making the 
final race, but finishing sixth 
overall and losing to UC Davis, 
who the Tritons had not lost to 
this year. 

"This is probably the fastest 
novice eight in UCSD history," 
Filippone said. "Both the varsity 
eight and novice eight may have 
done too much racing though.

Women's crew 
grabs 3 medals, 
but not enough 
By CARRIE ELIZABETH SKLAR 
Senior Staff Writer 

Three of the four women's crew 
boats that competed in the Pacific 
Coast Division II Championships in 
Lake Natoma, Calif., last weekend 
brought home medals, but UCSD 
still did not qualify for NCAA 
Rowing Championships. 

Nevertheless, coach Pattie 
Pinkerton was far from disappointed 
with her team, which was "a lot 
faster this weekend" than during its 
frustrating performance at the 
Western Intercollegiate Rowing 
Association Championships on May 
4 and May 5. 

According to Pinkerton, the 
improvement is difficult to notice 
because of poor weather, which got 
progressively worse during the day. 

"The conditions were pretty 
awful, so the times are not as rele-
vant as we would like," she said . 

Weather aside, the two varsity 
eight boats each brought home a 
bronze medal. 

The first varsity eight crew pl aced 
third with a time of 8 :03 behind 
Western Washington University at 
7:25 and University of California 
Davis at 7:35 . 

The boat was piloted by coxswain 
Claire Doyle, Emily Gray, Sara 
Patton, novice Sarah Tyler, Jennifer 
Wolsborn, Stefanie Barriere, novice 
Natalie Seitz, Emily Brennan and 
Anastasia Bolaris.
