PHOENIX - For Gov. George 
W. Bush of Texas, it may be too 
much success - and too soon. 

Now that he has chased the 
fifth candidate - Elizabeth Dole 
- out of the Republican presi-
dential competition, Bush leaves 
absolutely no question about his 
political might. 

Still, Bush's unprecedented 
success - never have so many 
big-name candidates exited a 
presidential race more than three 
months before the first votes are 
cast - could complicate what 
thus far been his painless glide to 
the nomination.

UCSD-TV Debuts Web Site 
lECIIiOLOIY: New project will feature programming from all UC campuses 
By VINCENT GRAGNANI 
News Editor 

UCSD joined two companies 
Tuesday in launching 
UcrVonlint.org, a web site fea-
turing enrichment broadcast 

pro~amming to a worldwide 
audience. 

The three-month pilot pro-
gram will deliver social and 
educational programming orig-
inating from UCSD-TV, an 
independent station operated 
from UCSD. 

Jennifer Hyle, UCSD-TV's 
marketing coordinator, said 
that the web site will be more 
than a rebroadcast of UCSD-
TV's programming; it will also 
feature programs from other 

. UC campuses. 
Programs featured on the 

site include "OperaTalk 
Lohengrin," "Understanding 
Bipolar Disorder," "The 
Tragedy and Lessons of 
Vietnam" and "Gamma Ra), 
Bursts - The Puzzle of God s 
Firecrackers. " 

Hyle said that anyone with a 
computer and 56k modem can 
view the programming. 

She added that the web site 
will be marketed to a wide vari-
ety of individuals and working 
professionals including UCSD 
alumni, faculty and students. 

INTERVU Inc. is using its 
media network to deliver 
UCTVonline.org's broadband 
video content, allowing a 

worldwide audience to access 
the programming. INTERVU is 
service provider for Internet 
audio and video solutions. 

Intel Corp. is funding the 
project. Hyle said that because 
Intel is a manufacturer of high-
er-end computers, it has an 
interest in developing content 
for computer users. 

Harry Gruber, chairman and 
CEO of INTERVU Inc., stated 
that UcrVonline.org will influ-
ence the academic community 
by increasing access to univer-
sity programming.

the selected streaming media 
service provider for this first-

Trolley 
Survey 
Released 
PLANS: Most students 
say they are not well-
infonned on the issues 
By JENNIFER KAPlAN 
Staff Writer 

In a survey taken last spring, 
over a third of students ques-
tioned indicated that the location 
of a proposed trolley stop would 
affect whether they would ride 
the trolley. 

The purpose of the survey was 
to find out if students were well-
informed regarding the trolley 
construction, whether or not they 
would use it as a means of trans-
portation to and from campus 
and where they thought the sta-
tion should be. 

Three-hundred-and-fifty stu-
dents filled out the surveys. 

About half of the students sur-
veyed said that they would ride 
the trolley at least moderately. 
Thirty-four percent of students 
said that the location of the trolley 
stop would affect how often they 
would ride it, while 14 percent 
said the location would have no 
effect. 

Over half of the students sur-
veyed agreed that the trolley 
should be located near the Price 
Center, Library Walk and Center 
Hall. Nineteen percent said they 
wanted the trolley to be put east 
of Interstate-S near Thornton 
Hospital. 

When asked whether they felt 
informed of the trolley plans, 37 
percent of students stated that 
they did not feel informed while 9 
percent stated that they had been 
well informed. 

Ninety-two percent of those 
surveyed said they felt that the 
A.S. Council should be involved 
in the placement of the trolley on 
campus.

New UC House Opened in the United Kingdom 
ABROAD: Center will strengthen ties between Europe and the University of California 
By TAMMY LO 
Guardian Reporter 

Students and staff of the 
University of California will 
enjoy stronger ties with the 
United Kingdom because of yes-
terday's California House open-
ing in London. 

The new center will serve as a 
central meeting place for the 
expanding UC Education 
Abroad Program (EAP), the UC 
Preas and other university pro-
grams taking place in Europe. 

UC President Richard 
AtIdnson said that the new <:en-

ter will not only strengthen the 
University of California's ties 
with the United Kingdom but 
also with the entire European 
community. 

"This ambitious effort will 
create new opportunities for 
increasing educational and trade 
connections between California, 
Britain and the rest of Europe," 
Atkinson said. "We look forward 
to the many benefits California 
House will create." 

Kim Burton, din!ctor of p~ 
grams abroad at UCSD said that 
while there are no concrete plans 
to expand programs abroad in 

the United Kingdom, she is excit-
ed by the possibilities that the 
California House will eventually 
provide in that area. 

She added that the new center 
provides the University of 
California with better facilities in 
the United Kingdom. 

Both Californian and British 
companies will have access to the 
facility for meetings, receptions, 
luncheons and brie1ings. In addi-
tion, the California House will 
provide a library with information 
about the EAp, teaching, research 
and public service opportunities at 
the university. Information on the 

economy, tourism, trade and 
investment in California will also 
be available at the library. 

Mary Carrigan, professor 
emeritus from the UCSD depart-
ment of theater, said that the new 
center is conveniently located in 
London and is a lot better than 
the old center which was housed 
above a bakery. 

She said that students study-
ing in the United Kingdom may 
be able to intern for the 
Califorrl'ia Commerce and Trade 
Association, which is in the same

TROLLEY: 
Smith hopes A.S. 
will pass resolution 
Contin •• d froIII ..... 1 
to the University Community 
Planning Group Benjamin Smith 
said that he hopes to get the A.s. 
Council to pass a resolution in 
support of locating the trolley 
stop closer to campus. 

"There are a lot of common 
sense reasons of why (the trolley) 
should be in the center of cam-
pus," Smith said. "I'm just trying 
to make a change." 

Smith said tfiat the purpose of 
the survey was to determine not 
whether there will be a trolley, 
but rather where the trolley sta-
tion should be located in relation 
to campus. 

Smith said that a trolley-coast-
er subcommittee decided last 
December to put the trolley sta-
tion on the east side of campus. 

Smith said that he was the 
only student at the meeting and 
the only person to object to the 
plan in the meeting. 

Khullar said that because mOst 
students were not involved in the 
planning process, a survey was 
necessary to accurately measure 
student opinion. 

NThere hadn't been student 

input in the decision, and this 
was the first time to say what 
they felt," Khullar said. 

He also said that the trolley 
will primarily serve UCSD stu-
dents and that students will not 

. use the trolley if the stop is far 
from the center of campus. 

"It should be close to campus, 
close to where we are ... the com-
mittee was very unbalanced and 

"There hadn't been 
student input in the 
decision, and this was the 
first time to say what they 
felt." 

-TelhKhulI.r 
A. S. President 

students had unfair representa-
tion," Smith said. 

Roosevelt junior senator Lana 
Kreidie said the A.S. Council will 
look at the survey results and will 
take them into a(count when 
forming an opinion on the issue. 

"The survey is something 
that the A.S. has encouraged as a 
means of seeing what students 
think," Kreidie said. "The A.S. 
(Council) will consider the num-
bers when taking a position on 
the place of the trolley at 
UCSD." 

The UCSD Guardian 

Kreidie added that she 
opposed placing the trolley in the 
middle of campus. 

"I personally think the trolley 
has more implications about 
noise level," she said. "It is 
important to take into considera- . 
lion the crime it would create and 
considering the campus' high 
population, having the trolley 
away from campus would allevi-
ate campus traffic." 

Campus Community Planner 
Milt Phegley said that the deci-
sion to locate the station on the 
east side of campus was made a 

lon~ time ago. 
, The decision to place the trol-

ley station on the east side of 
campus was made in the long-
range development plan of 1989," 
Phegley said. 

He added that although the 
east side of campus now seems 
isolated, in a few years, it will be 
a much more central and accessi-
ble location . • 

"It's a matter of the physical 
development of campus. It 
serves the medical center as well 
as the university center area," 
Phegley said. "Any other area on 
campus needs shuttle access 
anyway." 

Phegley also said that in three 
years tfiere will be a bridge across 
the 1-5 connecting east and west 
campuses.

Mexico Places Politics 
Ahead of Victims' Needs 

Following a rash of floods in nine Mexican states 
this month there has been an international call for 
relief efforts to assist those affected by the disaster. 
The Mexican government enraged many when it 
ordered relief agencies not to distribute American-
made relief supplies in the midst of the effort to help 
victims of the flooding . 

The illogical nature of this policy has confused 
many and frustrated Mexican citizens who have been 
ca lling on the government to provide desperately 
needed aid. Many of the donations were made by 
Mexican citizens but turned away because they had 
not been properly stamped upon importation to 
Mexico. Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo justified 
the rejection of foreign aid for disaster victims on the 
grounds that Mexico could handle the crisis itself, but 
this poorly conceived plan has resulted in the exclu-
sion of aid from the United States and Mexico alike. 

The more than 200,000 people left homeless by 
the flooding deserve a level of assistance and relief 
the Mexican government has so far failed to provide. 
Less time should be spent on tureaucratic nit-picking 
over where the aid is coming from, and authorities 
should instead focus on getting the victims of these 
disasters the supplies they desperately need in a time-
ly manner. Such moments of crisis are no time for 
political posturing. If anything the harmful policy of 
the Mexican gove1lJment has demonstrated an almost 
criminal neglect of the best interests of its country. 

Chula Vista Not a Wise 
Site for Futur. UC Campus 

The city leaders of Chula Vista are proposing a 
remedy to the current crunch of college-age students 
applying to the University of California. Chula Vista 
developers have promised more than 500 acres to the 
University of California. 1060 acres are needed to 
build a campus in the Otay Ranch area. 

The Guardian feels that the construction of an 
11 th UC campus in Chula Vista is neither wise nOT 
practi.;al. Chula Vista would be an undesirable loca-
tion for UC-eligible applicants from all areas of 
California. Also, with iii proximity to our existing 
campus in La Jolla, and even closer proximity to San 
Diego State University, Chula Vista hardly seems 
like a competitive site for a future Uc. 

With the recent decision to build a 10th UC campus 
in Merced, which will cost roughly $250 million to 
open, it seems as though funding for a university in 
Chula Vista does not exist. Talk of building an lIth 
campus while the 10th is still in its infant stages is high-
ly premature. The construction of a UC Chula Vista in 
the near future would take money away from the exist-
ing UC campuses and postpone further growth. 

All in all, the prospect of Chula Vista being the site 
for an lIth UC campus is nothing more than a local 
pipe dream; an attempt to lure status and respectabil-
ity to a lown that barely makes it on the map.

vision of a president 
By DAVID YEN 
Staff Writer 

A few months ago, officials from 
the "Gore for President" campaign 
expressed their heartfelt concern that 
the unusually strong race for the 
Democratic presidential nomination 
was tearing the party apart and hurt-
ing its prospects for Victory. 

I would like to offer a solution. AI, 
it's been a great run. Thanks for your 
more than 20 years of public service. 
Now it's time for you to step aside. 

Mr. vice president, for eight years 
you have been part of a successful 
yet controversial administration. 
You have played a role in helping to 
balance the budget, lower crime 
rates and provide greater access to 
education for our children. For these 
efforts, you are to be commended. 
But the presidency, as it is not to be 
inherited or purchased, must not be 
rewarded by association. 

The election is little more than a 
year away. In order to lead this great 
land of ours you must tell us who 
you are and what you plan to do. You 
have been in the public spotlight for 
almost a decade. So why is it that 
most Americans still do not know the 
answer to either of these questions? 

Maybe the . reason is that you 
don't really stand for anything. Like 
the Clintons, you rely almost exclu-
sively on polling. You have over-
whelmingly outspent your oppo-
nent, Bilf Bradley, on polling ser-
"ices. What are your own ideas? 

In June you told us that you were 
running a "campaign of your own." 
You said that you were not going to 
be another Bill Clinton. After all, you 
figured that the country was suffer-
mg from Clinton fatigue after that 
whole Lewinsky fiasco. So you start-
ed talking about saving social securi-
ty and medicare, about making edu-
cation your top priority and connect-

Come on AI, this charade 
has gone on for too long, 
Spare us this tired, recycled 
campaign and let someone 
with a real vision represent 
the party. We need people 
who believe in the issues, 
not people who simply 
identify the popular ones. 
ing schools to the Internet, about giv-
ing people the tools to make the most 
of their own lives. Wait a minute. 
Haven't we heard aU this before? 

You can't have it both ways. First 
you praise Clinton. You call him 
"one of the greatest presidents in 
U.S. history." Then you denounce his 
character and call his actions "terri-
ble." Now you say you are running a 
different campaign, yet you adopt all 
his ideas. What's going on here~ 

Furthermore, you only adopt posi-
tions strategically. If you really want-
ed to mark your candidacy as a 
"Clinton third term," then so be it, but 
you must take the good with the bad. 

What about your administration's 
unfinished business? What about 
Clinton's call for a stronger American 
community based on racial reconcili-
ation? You haven't addressed the 
issue of race relations until a few 
weeks ago, and that was only because 
your opponent brought it up. 

. What about the. tobacco bill that 
stalled in the Senate? You gave a 

teary-eyed speech at the '96 
Democratic convention about how 
cigarettes destroyed your sister. 
Then what do you do? You tum 
around, accept campaign money 
from tobacco lobbies, and now the 
issue is buried. 

Come on AI, this charade has 
gone on for too long. Spare us this 
tired, recycled campaign and let 
someone with a real vision represent 
the party. We need people who 
believe in the issues, not people who 
simply identify the popular ones. 

We also need someone the people 
can rally behind. For years, you have 
been the butt of jokes by Jay Leno 
and David Letterman. They call you 
"boring," "wooden," "statue-like." 
They joke that your secret service 
codename is "AI Bore." 

It hurts to be constantly ridiruied, 
I know. So now you are fighting 
back. You're trying to be more spon-
taneous, more loose. You're barking 
your speeches and striking new 
poses. You wear short-sleeved shirts. 
Guess what, Al - it's not working. 
Rule No.1 in life is to be yourself. If 
you can't even do that, how can you 
be president? 

.Finally, a few weeks ago, you pro-
claimed that you were "reinventing" 
your campaign. You said you were 
ready to take Bradley on and you 
called for weekly debates. You 
moved your headquarters from 
Washington to Nashville so you 
could be more in touch with the pe0-
ple. You called yourself the "under-
dog." 

Let's face it, AI, it will take more 
than a shift in location to save your 
presidential aspirations. Frankly, it 
will take a miracle. How can you jus-
tify the hypocrisy of ignoring 
Bradley completely for four or five 
months, and then clamoring for 
debates? 

How credible is it for you to call 
yourself the "underdog" when you 
have been vice preSident for eight 
years, you have the entire 
Democratic caucus supporting you 
and have had eight years to fund-

Over the last few weeks, I've 
come to the conclusion that if I

I'm not going to get an online

I have lost all hope in mail

So the bottom line is this, AI: 
As vice preSident, you were 
good. You had little responSibili-

was clap your hands and attack 
other people (you're good at 
that). You belittled Bush in '92, 
attacked Dole in '96 and now 
you're starting to level your 
blows at Bradley. 

But presidents are a different 
breed. Presidents lead. Presidents 
envision. Presidents tell people 
what they stand for, and they 
advocate their own policies 
rather than attack those of others. 

The decision is near. Soon we

hijacks UPS trucks. It just isn't 
Clone. 

In theory, deliveries to my 
apartment building are easily 
handled and don't impose on 
the recipient of a package, much 
in the same way that commu-
nism theoretically works. In 
practice, however, much like 
communism, I could chill in my 
apartment with some charcoal-
filtered Ralphs vodka for a full 
two weeks and never see the 
package I ordered a month ago. 

What is supposed to happen 
. is this: The UPS man goes to my 
apartment complex, buzzes him-
self in, knocks on my door and if 
I'm not there, goes to the leasing 
office and the people there sign 
for it. They, in turn, leave a mes-
sage on my answering machine. 

I suspect that what actually 
happens is that he goes to my 
apartment complex, buzzes him-
self off some charcoal-filtered 
Ralphs vodka, then heads over 
to the leasing office and matches 
shots with the receptionist. 

If you hear those commercials 
on the radio about tracking your 
package on the Internet, storing 
people's signatures electronical-
ly or downloading spy satellite 

photos of the truck, most of that 
stuff is true. 

If you remember the 48-char-
acter alpha-numeric tracking 
number you can go on the 
Internet, type it in and see where 
everything went wrong. For my 
package, it usually. happens 
about the time the plane lands in 
San Diego. Then the package just 
disappears for days on end. The 
status goes from "Shipping" to 
"Exceptional" - like it's an AP 
National Scholar that got lost in 
downtown San Diego. 

The amazing thing about UPS 
is that they actually have differ-
ent types of shipping .. The differ-
ences are subtle: "Ground" 
means that it will sit in a San 
Diego receiving warehouse for 
two weeks, and "2nd Day Air" 
means that it will sit in a San 
Diego receiving warehouse for 
two weeks. 

After my experience with 
UPS, I decided to turn to some-
one I could trust, an entity that 
stoop for reliability, excellence 
in management and service 
with a smile: the U.S. govern-
ment. From my previous expe-

Sustained by their parents' 
pocket books, college students 
rarely have to worry about what 
they will eat next week, if the gas 
will be shut off soon or whether 
car insurance should get paid this 
month. Not that we don't worry 
about money, but cable television, 
a new pair of Chanel shoes and 
the hottest new computer game 
aren't what most poor families 
would call necessities. 

Determining what is a necessi-
ty in today's American society 
and economy is difficult. 

According to an article in 
Monday's New York Times, the 
U.S. Census Bureau is "revising 
its definition of what constitutes 
poverty in the United States," and 
'experimen.ting with a formula 
that would drop millions more 
families below the poverty line." 

Currently, the annual income 
threshold for living above poverty 
for a family of four is $16,600. 
Wi.:1 the new formula, this thresh-
old would rise to $19,500, pushing 
the number of Americans living 
below the poverty line from 12.7 
percent of the population to 17 

percent (46 million people), 
according to the article. 

And all the Republicans gasp. 
More federal slibsidy for the poor? 
What is tiris, tire 1011115011 era? 

But the new formula doesn' t 
go far enough. Not for me and 
not for the poor. 

Four people on $19,500 a year? I 
can't believe it used to be $16, 600. 

Can you imagine? The govern-
ment expects a family of four to 
live on a little more money than 
one coUege student lives on during 
the year. Granted, a family of four 
doesn't have to pay tuition or pur-
chase books, but that's four 
mouths to feed, four bodies to 
clothe, four hair cuts to get and 128 
teeth to clean (give or take a few 
depending on the age of the chil-
dren). And that doesn't even start 
to count housing, health care, elec-
tricity, a car, or dental care. 

As a child growing up in the 
care of a single mother with an 
older brother and a younger sis-
ter, I know what it is like to be 
poor. Federal subsidies help but 
typically not enough. Health care 
is for broken bones only and den-
tal care is what the school nurse

Editor: 
This July, Gov. Gray Davis 

signed the Clean Water and 
Pollution Prevention Act into 
law, marking the successful end 
of a two-year campaign by 
Ca lifornia Student Public 
Interest Group (CaIPIRG). 

"This is a major victory for 
students and the public at 
large," said Noah Greer, chair 
of CaIPIRG's UCSD chapter. 
"This sends a clear message to 
illegal water folluters that their 
activi ties wil not be tolerated 
anymore." 

Over 74 percent of 
California 's rivers and streams 
and over 93 percent of 
California 's bays are classified 
as unsafe for swimming and 
fishing. The San Francisco Bay 

is so polluted that state officials 
warn residents against eating 
more than a sliver of fish from 
the area per month to avoid ill-
ness. 

"Water is a key part of why 
people come to California - it's 
a travesty when you want to 
enjoy the beach or go fishing and 
you can't because the water is 
polluted," said Greer. 

The new law is modeled after 
a successful New Jersey law 
passed in 1990. At the time, New 
Jersey was ranked among the 
worst in the country for compli-
ance with clean water laws. 
Now New Jersey is a national 
leader in compliance with these 
laws. 

"Without strict enforcement 
of clean water laws with finan-
cial penalties, companies have 
no incentive to obey the law. " 
Greer said "Now it will be in 
companies' financial interest to 
help the environment." 

CalPIRG led a statewide 
coalition for two years to pass 
the law, with strong opposition 
from large industries such as 
Chevron, UNOCAL and ARCO. 
CalPIRG sent thousands of 
postcards to various state repre-
sentatives and the governor, 
built a coalition of over 60 fish-
ermen's, public health and 
other community groups, con-
ducted research on water pollu-
tion that was then presented to 
the media and followed candi-
dates for state offices on the 
campaign trail until they signed 
the "Clea n Water pledge." It 
was during one of these "fish-
dogging" tours that CalPIRG 
got then-candidate Davis to 
pledge to support the strength-
ened enforcement of clean 
water laws. 

• "We never had even a fraction 
of the money polluters had to 
spend but we ran a great, persis-
tent grassroots campaign, did 
some great research that was 
unquestionable and lobbied very 
hard in Sacramento." Greer said 
"This is proof that when stu-
dents are organized, they can 
make a difference." 

CalPIRG plans to monitor 
the implementation of the law, 
as polluters have pledged to 
rollback or weaken the law. 
CalPIRG will also be focusing 
on stopping efforts underway 
to allow oil companies to drill 
for more oil off the California 
coast. 

"As always, it's going to be a 
busy year with a lot of impor-
tant issues to fight for." Greer 
said. "We want to thank the 
thousands of students who 
have pledged CaIPIRG, signed 
a petition and gotten involved. 
Together we can make a differ-
ence."

Editor: 
Kevin 5eid's diatribe "Where 

have all the student parking lots 
gone?" (Oct. 14) displays the 
astonishing contempt of some-
one who appears to consider it 
every student's God-given right 
to be guaranteed convenient 
parking right next to class. 

His lamentable tale of woe 
includes the mind-numbing 
conclusion that, for students 
living within a few blocks of the 
new 1500-space Regents Road 
lot, "it hardly seems worth the 

effort [to drive to campus] 
when the drive to the parking 
lot is shorter than the shuttle 
trip to get to your lecture hall". 
Good God! Did he ever stop to 
think that those living so close 
to campus shouldn't be driving 
in the first place? 

He goes on to say that heavy 
book bags will deter people from 
walking from the lot to the cen-
ter of campus and that these stu-
dents "might be too tired at the 
end of the day to walk back." 
Aside from the fact that there are 
very regular shuttles available 
throughout the day to take stu-
dents back to the parking lots, a 
little exercise never did anyone 
any harm. 

Instead of his ludicrous com-
mentary, he should have written 
an article about the cause of such 
a parking crunch: too many solo 
student drivers. But Kevin's arti-
cle, best summarized by his 
over-use of the word "inconve-
nient," shows the ridiculous 
mentality of instant parking 
gratification that some seem to 
expect. Has he considered that 
one should seek, dare I say it, 
alternative forms of transporta-
tion to get to campus? 
Apparently not. 

Kevin should get himself to 
the Rideshare Operations office 
and learn about alternative 
forms of transport, use the pro-
grams - free bus stickers, bicy-
cle commuting, car- and van-
pooling, even walking! Then he 
should tell all of his friends to do 
the same, and, for goodness' 
sake, he should stop whining 
about campus parking. 

- Andrew Goodwillie 
Scripps Institute of 

Octtlllograpiry 

provides. 
According to the same New 

York Times article, the new 
approach to recalculating the 
poverty level Utries to determine 
what a low-income family must 
spend not only to survive but to 
preserve a reasonable amount of 
self-respect." 

Then, how the hell did the 
Census Bureau come up with 
$19,500? 

$19,500 is about what most col-
lege students would make if they 
kept their summer jobs and 
worked all year. $19,500 is about 
what a single parent would make 
at $8 dollars an hour working 50 
hours a week and 50 weeks a year. 

Sociologists and economists put 
the poverty line threshold between 
$21,000 and $28,000 for a family of 
four, reports the New York Times. So 
why the discrepancy? 

According to the New York 
Times article, ".. . because the 
bureau's criteria, based largely on 
a study by the National Academy 
of Science, do not allow extra cash 
for emergencies - to fix a car, say, 
or repair a leaky roof, or to buy 
health i!lSl1rance." 

The Census Bureau, which still 
uses President Johnson's 1965 for-
mula for determining the poverty 
line, does not understand that a 
1960s income will not buy nearly 
as much now as it did back then. 
Perhaps the low poverty line is just 
a ploy to pacify those of us who are 
above the line and make us feel 
better about our own lot in life. 

For us Americans to truly con-
sider ourselves the wealthiest 
nation in the world, we must take 
care of our poor.

U.S .Stored Nuclear Weapons Abroad MIDEAST: 
Peace effort could 
go without results 

acknowledged Wednesday. 
Barak has made it clea r that he 

hopes the Uni ted States wil l lower 
its profile, and Berger suggested 
Wednesday that Washington has 
taken on a more restrained role 
with the accord signed at Sharm el 
Sheik, along the Red Sea in Egypt, 
in early September, two months 
after Barak took office and formed 
a new government. 

The United States stored 
12,000 nuclear weapons and 
components in Morocco, Japan, 
Iceland, Puerto Rico, Cuba and 
at least 23 other countries and 
five u.s. territories during the 
Cold War, according to a new 
article based on a recently 
declassified documeRt. 

The document, a secret study 
written by the Defense 
Department and entitled 
"History of the Custody and 
Deployment of Nuclear 
Weapons," is described in the 
cover story of the 
i\lovember / December issue of 
Tile Bulletin of the Atomic 
Scientists. 

Altogether, the article says, 
between 1945 and 1977 the 
United States stored 38 types of 
nuclear weapons systems at U.S. 
or allied bases abroad . 

While other declassified doc-
uments have made it clear that 
the United States deployed 
nuclear weapons and materials 
overseas, the document con-
firms how widespread the 
deployments were and high-
lights America's overriding 
dependence at the time on a 
worldwide network of weapons 
of mass destruction. 

While other declassified 
documents have made it 
clear that the United 
States deployed nuclear 
weapons and materials 
overseas, the document 
confirms how widespread 
the deployments were 
and highlights America's 
overriding dependence at 
the time on a worldwide 
network of weapons of 
mass destruction. 

The magazine article empha-
sizes the extent to which the 
Pentagon manufactured special 
nuclear weapons in which the 
plutonium or uranium could be 
removed and stored elsewhere 
in order to evade the issue of 
whether nuclear weapons or 
materials were stored in coun-
tries where there was intense 
anti-nuclear fervor. 

"The Pentagon document 
fundamentally revises some 
aspects of postwar nuclear histo-
ry," said William M. Arkin, a 

Sniping Over Budget 
Resumes in Congress 

WASHINGTON - After a 
conciliatory meeting at the 
White House on Tuesday night, 
Republicans and Democrats in 
Congress reverted to form 
Wednesday, sniping at each 
other over the budget and 
attending more to political posi-
tioning than to bridging their 
differences. 

First thing Wednesday morn-
ing, the House Republican lead-
ers brought up a bill to finance 
programs of the Departments of 
Commerce, Justice and State and 
pushed it through on a near 
party-line vote in the full knowl-
edge that President Clinton 
would veto it. 

Later, Rep. Tom DeLay, R-
Texas, the majority whip, called a 
news conference with several 
other Republicans and accused 
'the president of wanting to raise 
taxes and spend money reserved 
for Social Security on other pro-
grams, such as foreign aid. 

Democrats in Congress said 
Republicans were negotiating in 

BUSH: 
Candidate pool has 
shrunk dramatically 
C ....... d,.... ..... l 

For months, Bush has bene-
fited immeasurably from divi-
sions among his opponents. But 
now, those left standing, partic-
ularly Sen. John McCain of 
Arizona and Steve Forbes, have 
a much clearer, though certainly 
uphill, shot at toppling the 
front-runner, particularly as the 
campaign enters a phase of 
high-profile debates. 

Some of Bush's advisers said 
they would have preferred that 
Mrs. Dole had stayed in the race, 
at the very least to distract 
McCain and the others. 

The shrunken Republican 
field will give those still compet-
ing a much larger public stage. 
Besides McCain and Forbes, Gary 
Bauer has been organizing 
aggressively among . grassroots 

bad faith. Sen. Tom Daschle, 0-
S.D., the minority leader, accused 
Republicans of "duplicity when it 
comes to the budse~' 

Rep. Dick Gephardt of 
Missouri, the Democratic leader, 
said in an interview that the 
Republicans had agreed at the 
White House meeting on 
Tuesday to consider all the 
spending bills at once but were 
already reneging and taking 
them up one at a time. 

"There's a bad disagreement 
on process," Gephardt said. NThe 
result is that we're going to be 
here till the Super Bowl." 

Republicans acknowledged 
that the president requested con-
sideration of all the controver-
sies together, but they said they 
had never agreed to that proce-
dure. 

After the White House meeting, 
both sides promised to work 
together over the next week or so 
to resolve their budget differences.

conservatives. Sen. Orrin Hatch 
of Utah and Alan Keyes, the 
radio talk show host, are also 
campaigning. 

But the timing of Mrs. Dole's 
announcement was most propi-
tious for McCain because he has 
been battling Mrs. Doll! over the 
same pool of moderate and inde-
pendent voters and, in the past 
several weeks, has been on some-
thing of a roll: He recently com-
pleted a successful book tour. He 
is creeping up on Bush in polls in 
New Hampshire, which holds 
the first primary. 

This week, he grabbed the 
endorsement of the borough 
president of Staten Island, Guy 
Molinari, who defected from the 
Bush campaign. And while his 
bill to overhaul the campaign 
finance system suffered a sting-
ing defeat in the Senate on 
Thesday, McCain attracted plenty 
of publicity for pushing the mea-
sure.

nuclear weapons analyst and 
one of the article's three co-
authors. It reveals, for example, 
that the first U.S. nuclear 
weapons placed overseas were 
sent not to Britain, as many his-
torians had believed, but to 
Morocco. 

However, Arkin and his co-
authors caution that the declas-
sified study and an annex list-
ing the countries where nuclear 
weapons were placed or stored 
contain some errors. 

For instance, the annex fails 
to list Portugal's Azores Islands 
or Libya, places where Arkin 
says other declassified docu-
ments show that the Strategic 
Air Command stored nuclear 
weapons in the 1950s and 
1900s. 

The study does confirm that 
U.S. nuclear weapons or mate-
rials were sent to such sensitive 
areas as Japan, Greenland, 
Iceland and Taiwan, which 
have all forsworn nuclear 
weapons and publicly vowed 
not to store them on their terri-
tory.

ContInued from PICe 1

the Wye River Accord, signed a 
year ago this week. 

Oslo was also the site of the 
1993 peace accord in which Israel 
first agreed to withdrawals from 
the West Bank and both sides 
agreed to negotiate a final peace 
settlement. 

But progress since then has 
been episodic, 

Essentia lly a revision of the 
Wye Accord, the la test agreement

American role, though Clinton 
and Berger spent much of August 
on the phone with both leaders. 

The agree-

clearly con-

could simply 
drag on without

"This is one

foreign policy 
advisers said 
recently. 

Essentially a revision of

Financial Laws Overhauled 
WASHINGTON - After 

more than 20 years of battles, 
truces and unholy alliances over 
broad legislation to reshape the 
nation's financial system, the 
measure's fate rests on what has 

~ into a bitter and largely 
symbolic political fight between 
Presidl'nt Clinton and Sen. Phil 
Gramm, R-Texas. 

More than seven hours of 
negotiations Wednesday involv-
ing Gramm, chairman of the 
Senate Banking Committee, 
Treasury Secretary Lawrence 
Summers and Gene Sperling, the 
president's top economic advis-
er, inched closer to a resolution 
but failed to yield a deal over the 
legislation's effect on a 1977 law 
aimed at eradicating discrimina-
tion in lending. 

The main sticking point 
appeared to be whether to require 
community groups to divulge the 
details of deals they strike with 
banks to make loans to minorities 
and the disadvantaged. 

The talks may continue this 
week, or Gramm, and his coun-
terpart in the House, Rep. James 

Leach, may try to force the issue 
by a vote of the House-Senate 
conference committee. 

But even as the administration 
and Gramm moved slightly clos-
er to agreement, the positions on 
both sides of the Community 
Reinvestment Act of 1977 have 
begun to harden. As the talks, 
which began late Monday night, 
begin to stretch out, the prospects 
of overhauling the banking sys-
tem begin to fade. 

Both sides have begun to rec-
ognize political benefits from 
standing firm as the new election 
cycle ~ns, even as the most 
powerfuT financial interests in 
America clamor for a new law. 
Gramm and other Republicans 
would undoubtedly blame the 
White House for failing to 
approve a bill long sought by 
Wall Street and corporate 
America. Equally, Clinton and 
Vice President Al Gore would 
undoubtedly be able to accuse the 
Republicans of retarding decades 
of progress in civil rights. 

Lobbyists who champion the 
legislation agreed. "If there is 

not a bill, it will be because the 
White House and the Treasury 
Department feel very strongly 
about the Community 
Reinvestment Act, and Senator 
Gramm feels equally strongly, 
and both s ides think they will 
win the White House next term 
and can get a better bi ll," said 
Paul A. Equale, a lobbyist for the 
Independent Insurance Agents 
of America . 

"The array of ant i-minority 
sentiment expressed almost each 
week now by Republicans is his-
toric," said Sen. Tom Daschle, 0-
S.D., the minority leader, cit ing 
Gramm's view on the 
Community Reinvestment Act, 
among other things. " I have 
never seen a party become this 
defiant when it comes to protect-
ing minority rights in my time in 
public life.' 

Gramm said that " in the end 
the adminis tration has to 
decide if they want a bill or 
not."

Monument to Japanese American 
Internees Will Rise in Capital 

WASHINGTON - Hundreds 
of families were crowded togeth-
er in despair in the desert heat of 
an Arizona internment camp in 
1942 when Eleanor Roosevelt 
suddenly appeared one day 
pleading with them not to lose 
faith in American democracy. 

"Can you imagine?" asked 
Cherry Tsutsumida, exulting 
anew at the apparition-like visit 
57 years ago. She was then a dis-
heartened 6-year-old in the 
camp of uprooted Americans. 

"Now that's a great woman," 
Ms. Tsutsumida said, remem-
bering details of the first lady's 
silk blouse and gabardine skirt 
and, above all, of toe comfort 
that she brought to the trauma-
tizeci Americans. 

In one of the great domestic 
tragedies of World War II, 
120,000 Japanese Americans had 
been denied due process and 

trucked off by federal agents 
after Japan attacked Pearl 
Harbor, solely because of their 
Japanese ancestry. 

"This great lady, coming out to 
tell us not to lose faith," said the 
American-bom Ms. Tsutsumida, 
explaining in a rush of recollec-
tions just why she could never 
lose faith. 

Such memories of the harsh 
world of the interned Japanese 
Americans of World War II will 
soon have a focus near the Capitol 
in a sculptured pair of graceful 
flying cranes - one pinioned by 
the barbed wire of internment, the 
other soaring like Ms. 
Tsutsumida's faith in America. 

The bronze sculpture will be 
the centerpiece of a street-corner 
memorial park three blocks 
north of the Senate chamber. 
Construction is to begin Friday 
amid a celebration by some 

durable Americans who well 
recall their internment. 

"The monument will tell the 
story forever," 80-year-old Joe 
Ichiuji said, looking back to 
when federal agents ominously 
descended along the Pacific 
Coast. 

To neutralize local leadership 
and forestall any protest, agents 
first arrested the elders - fathers 
of thousands of Japanese 
American families. Most were 
too stunned to disobey the gov-
ernment, said Ichiuji, who went 
from being a 22-year-old citizen, 
proud to have been drafted into 
the U.S. Army, before Pearl 
Harbor, to an official pariah dis-
charged as an "enemy alien" and 
bound for internment. 

Families soon followed the 
fathers into exile.

Study Ranks Favorite Employers LONDON: Alumni encouraged 
to use the center 
ContInued from ..... 1 
building as the new center. 

SURVEY: Walt Disney and Microsoft are among the top 10 places to work 
By KATE SEVERSON 
The Collegiate Times 

BLACKSBURG, Va. - Walt 
Disney and Microsoft ha ve a 
common bond - students rank 
them among the top 10 places to 
work after graduation, accord-
ing to a recent study. 

A New York City-based firm 
surveyed undergraduate stu-
dents at Virginia Tech and other 
colleges across the country 
about their future goals and 
ideas concerning prospective 
employers. 

Universum, a competence 
relations firm, urveyed stu-
dents from February to May 
1999, and published the results 
in the September issue of For/I/lle 
magazine. 

The survey consisted of 3,166 
students in business, computer 
science and engineering majors. 

According to the survey 
results, the top 10 list of ideal 
employers among business 
majors include, in order, 
PricewaterhouseCoopers, Walt 
Disney, Ernst & Young, 
Goldman Sachs, Microsoft, 
Arthur Andersen, Deloitte & 
Touche, Coca-Cola, Andersen 
Consulting and Merill Lynch. 

"That list makes sense to 
me," said Erin jewel, a sopho-
more accounting major. "(The 
companies) have really g(1od 
names and are very successful. 
You would have a good future 
and the chance to move up." 

The top 10 idea l employers 
among computer science stu-
dents included, in order, 
Microsoft, IBM, Sun 
Microsystems, Hewlett Packard, 

Intel, Yahoo!, Lucent 
Technologies, Dell Computers, 
Si licon Graphics and Sony. 

Although these companies 
may reflect the majority's ideals, 
the results do not reflect all stu-
dents' opinions. 

''I'm looking fo r a medium-
sized, not-so-mainstreamed 
company," sa id David 
Anderson, a junior computer 
science major. 

According to the survey 
results. the top 10 list of 
ideal employers among 
business majors include, 
in order, Pricewater-
houseCoopers, Walt 
Disney, Ernst & Young, 
Goldman Sachs, 
Microsoft, Arthur 
Andersen, Deloitte & 
Touche, Coca-Cola, 
Andersen Consulting 
and Merill Lynch. 

Anderson said the listed 
companies are appeali ng to stu-
dents because of their big names 
and large sales. 

The top 10 idea l employers 
among engineering students 
include Walt Disney, IBM, 
Boeing, Lockheed Martin 
Corporation, Andersen 
Consulting, Microsoft, Lucent 
Technologies, Intel, johnson & 
Johnson and Hewlett Packard. 

"All of those companies 
recru it here at Tech," said Lynn 
Nystrom, director of news for 

the College of Engineering. 
"Most participate annually at 
the Engineering Expo." 

Lockheed Martin, the fourth-
ranked engineering company, 
has a strong presence here on 
campus, Nystrom said. 

"Lockheed hired 40 of our 
graduates last year," Nystrom 
said. 

"They're incredibly support-
ive of our student groups as 
well." 

According to Nystrom, 
Tech's engineering graduates 
are well-prepared to work for 
the listed ideal companies. 

"We are a targeted college of 
engineering for companies like 
these," Nystrom said. 

"If [major companies] weren't 
interested in our students, or did-
n't think they were qualified, they 
wouldn' t come to the Expo." 

The survey was conducted 
through questionnaires. 

"Paper questionnaires were 
distributed to undergraduate 
students in business, engineer-
ing and computer science across 
the country," said KatarinJ 
Janson, public relations manager 
for Universum. 

Universul11 is an internation-
al research and consult ing firm, 
Janson sa id . 

Universum started as a 
research firm set out to survey 
undergraduate college students 
internationally. In the past 
Universum has surveyed gradu-
ate students in the United States, 
Janson said. 

This is the first survey per-
formed by the firm to investi-
gate opinions of undergraduate 
students. 

Carrigan also said that alumni 
will be encouraged to have meet-
ings in the center and use it as a 
place for networking. 

Donald W. Crawford, director 
of the EAP office in London, stat-
ed that the new center will help 
students studying abroad in 
Great Britain by providing 
stronger ties between them and 
the University of California . 

"UC's study abroad program 
is the largest of its kind in the 
world; We currently have stu-
dent exchanges with 19 universi-
ties in the United Kingdom," 
Crawford said. "We' re excited to 
be an integral part of the 
California House project of creat-
ing more linkages between edu-
cation, research, UC alumni and 
Cali fo rnia commerce." 

Si nce 1989, Californ ia has 
staffed a foreign trade office in 
London. The office helps increase 
trade and investment opportuni-
ties by promoting goods and ser-
vices in the United Kingdom. 

The EAP and UC Press both 
have had offices in London for 
over 35 years. As a resu lt, the 
California House also plans to 
extend outreach programs to 
include the university's nea rly 
5,000 alumni in Britain and other 
parts of Europe.

CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. 
The University of Virginia 's 
Board of Visitors unanimously 
recommended the use of race 
information in the admissions 
process after several hours of 
closed session discussion 
Saturday. The board passed a 
resolution supporting the uni-

stated its willingness to defend 
the policy in court. 

The resolution also refutes the 
claim that minority students are 
accepted to the unjversity with 
lower standards. University 
President John T. Casteen III 
recently eliminated a point sys-
tem in the university's admis-
sions process. He reinforced the 
university's commitment to 
"recruiting and enrolling stu-

In past weeks, the university 
has seen controversy and protests 
about the use of race.

Kalamazoo Student 
Kill. Hlm .. 1f and 
GlrIfrI.nd Monday 

ANN ARBOR, Mich. - Two 
Kalamazoo College students 
died of gunshot wounds 
Monday in an apparent murder-
suicide. 

The Kalamazoo Department 
of Public Safety said that Neenef 
Odah, 20, of Seattle, Wash. shot 
his former girlfriend, Maragaret 
Wardle, 19, of Plainwell, Mich., 
before turning the gun on him-
self. The shooting reportedly fol-
lowed an argument between the 
two shortly after midnight on 
the small liberal arts school cam-
pus. 

All classes were canceled 
Tuesday. Students and staff were 
notified of the deaths bye-mail. 
Counselors were made available 
to students. 

Students at the schools 
expressed surprise, saying that 
Odah did not seem unhappy or 
capable of such an act. Kirsten 
Fritch, a friend who saw Odah 24 
hours · prior to the murder-sui-
cide, said everything seemed nor-
mal. She said that Odah was 
quiet, but always friendly. 

Odah and Wardle began dat-
ing last year and broke up about 
a month ago. Odah purchased 
the shotgun used in the double-
homicide shortly after the break-
up.

EAST LANS[NG, Mich . -
While they say the threat is 
unlikely, some Michigan State 
University (MSU) faculty and 
staff members will plan a 
defense strategy in case the uni-

versity is ever the. target of 
bioterrorism. 

Meeting yesterday and today, 
the group wants to develop for-
mal procedures for prevention, 
detection and response to bioter-
-rorism attacks. This is the first 
known plan of its kind for a uni-
verSity. 

judith Collins, a criminal jus-
tice assistant professor, has been 
working with MSU Police Chief 
Bruce Benson for a year studying 
bioterrorism and other risk eval-
uation issues. Collins said a 
bioterrorist attack at MSU is 
unlikely, but MSU should have a 
plan nonetheless. 

John Parmer, director of the 
Office of Radiation, Chemical & 
Biological Safety, said that the 
most likely biological agent to be 
used in an attack is anthrax. He 
said other agents are not a threat 
because they are very difficult to 
obtain. 

Collins said the assessment 
will be interactive. She said at 
the end of the two days, the 
group hopes to have a final plan 
detailing what to do in the event 
of a biofogical attack. Responses 
to an attack include implement-
ing a university-wide communi-
cation network, identifying 
evacuation routes and check-
points, and distributing protec-
tive gear.

F ..... I Jury: MIT Not 
U ..... In Death. of '80s 
Cancer Pldlent. 

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. - A fed-
eral jury found Friday that MIT is 
not responsible for the deaths of 
two patients who underwent 
experimental radiation treatment 
for cancer in the 1960s. 

Massachusetts ' General 
Hospital (MGH) and retired neu-
rosurgeon William Sweet were 
held liable, however, and were 
ordered to pay the victims' fami-
lies a total of $8 million. 

George Heinrich and Eileen 
Siekewicz underwent experimen-
tal boron neutron capture thera-
py from a nuclear reactor at MIT. 
The suit alleged that MGH and 
Sweet were negligent in their 
attempts to treat brain cancer. 
The Heinrich family was award-
ed $2.5 million and the 
Sienkewicz family $5.5 million. 

MIT was named in the suit for 
providing the use of the reactor 
facilities, but the doctors were all 
from MGH.

Northwestern University (NU) 
administrators sent a letter 
Tuesday to white supremacist 
author Matt Hale explaining the

The pamphlets, titled "Facts 
that the Government and the

were written by Hale, the leader

group based in East Peoria . 

The letter explained that peo-

UCSD-TV: 
Atkinson praised the 
new web site 
ContInued from PllCe 1 
time, innovative UCSD web-
based program," Gruber said. 
"We believe that the delivery of 
audio and video over the 
Internet will have a profound 
impact on educational institu-
tions and their ability to share 
their educational and social 
information with individuals 
and organizations worldwide. 
We hope this will be the begin-
ning of a long-tenn relationShip 
with the UC system and are con-
fident that our streaming media 
technology will help extend its 
educational content to the mass-
es." 

UC President Richard 
Atkinson also praised the new 
program. 

"This online initiative is a 
demonstration of the University 
of California's strong support for 
the integration of technology and 
education and our leadership 
role among the educational com-
munity in using media technolo-
gy," Atkinson said. "While this 
initial broadcast reflects only a 
portion of the university's activi-
ties, it represents a major step 
forward in expanding the educa-
tional and cultural reach of all of 
our campuses. 

Long-tenn plans call for the 
development of streamed pro-
gramming focusing on seminars 
and research briefings; develop-
ment and credentialing pro-
grams; and eventually, academic 
courses for credit.

'Cutting The Edge of Dance in San Diego 
This Fridays 'Cutting the Edge' is certain 
to be a memorable dance performance 
By HANNAH GRIFFITH 
Staff Woter 

Though some of the dancers 
have started to joke that it should 
be called "Cutting the Cloth" 
because large amounts of fabric 
are used onstage during two of 
the pieces, "Cutting the Edge" is 
an appropriate name for this Fri-
day's dance concert in the Man-
deville Auditorium. Featuring the 
work of jean Isaacs, Patricia Rin-
con and Kim Epifano, the concert 
is sure to be a performance worth 
seeing. its sole drawback being 
that it's only a one-night event. 

The poster event is the pre-

miere of Isaacs' newest work, 
"A merican Beauty," presented by 
the San Diego Dance Theatre. In 
this piece, the dancers appear in 
bolts of deep red, silken fabric 
that they stretch into various 
shapes as they move. The title 
comes from the red of the fabric, 
which is the same color as the 
famous rose variety "American 
Beauty." The title is completely 
unrelated to the recently released 
movie of the same name. The 
themes of birth, maturation and 
death correspond to the life of a 
rose.

UCSD dance professors are leaders in the 
San Diego da'nce community 
By HANNAH GRIFFITH 
Staff Writer 

This Friday is an important 
day both for UCSD and for dance 
in San Diego. For the first time in 
23 yea rs, loca I choreogra phers 
and dancers will perform through 
University Events Office in the 
Mandeville Auditorium. The sur-
prise, however, is not that such a 
performance is happening, but 
that it took so long for it to come 
about. 

With high-caliber local 
dancers and choreographers in 
both faculty and staff teaching 
positions in the department, it 

would seem natural for such col-
laborations to be a regular item 
on the University Events pro-
gram. The dance facu lty thought 
so, too. 

"We'~e been trying for years 
to get something like this to hap-
pen," said jean Isaacs, a member 
of the UCSD dance faculty. 

Happily, University Events 
presenter Lynn Peterson has now 
realized what a gold mine of 
choreographic talent exists in 
UCSD's own backyard. 

UCSD Presents often features 
both music and dance groups that

,Killing Us Softly With No Songs 
WyclejJean hosted a successful party at UCSD last Friday, but he forgot to bring the goods 
By JEREMY GRAY 
Senior Staff Writer 

Let's hope Wyclef jean was tai-
loring his show to the anti-social 
UCSD campus when he arrived 
at RIMAC Arena on October 14. 
In a performance that featured an 
emcee battle, four gymnastic 
flips, a dance contest, an hour of 
partying to the sounds of other 
artists' music and a partridge in a 
pear tree, Wyclef only seemed to 
forget to bring one thing - talent. 

That is no small feat for the 
frontman of the Fugees, whose 
often diabolical lyrical skills drip 
off of vinyl like syrup and taste 
just as sweet. And yes, the show 
was not without its highlights -
not one but two versions of 
"Gone Till November," audience 
favorite "Guantanamera," and a 
powerful and unfortunately 
unfinished rendition of "Gun-
powder." But, if his opening song 
"No Woman No Cry" was any 
indication, Wyclef wasn' t on 
stage to earn pOints for vocal 
skills. He wanted to party, smoke 
ganja, and party some more. 

So instead of Wyclef jean and 
the Refugee All-Stars, what the 
mostly college iludience got WilS 
Wyclef jean's Dance-All-Night 
Party Machine. The only thing 
missing was the ,segment where 
two teenagers unscramble words 
on a magnetic board. 

The mystery enshrouding 
jean's performance leaves more 
questions than answers: Did he 
smoke too much of the good stuff 
before (and during) the: show? 
Did he want to do something dif-

ferent than the standard concert? 
Or did he know that the UCSD 
campus doesn't know how to 
party, and thus made it his quest 
to teach us how to groove? 

Things were plodding along, if 
not smoothly, for the first 90 min-
utes of his eventual two-and-a-
half hour show. And then a 
strange transformation took place 

- Wyclef morphed into a ring-
leader, parading the stage while 
his deejay played snippets of any-
thing from Notorious BIG to lau-
ren Hill to TLC's "No Scrubs" 

(and the resulting parody " 0 
Pigeons" for the fellas) . At first it 
seemed fun, but as the clock

TheIlu ....... I_ 
Savage Night 

---
-•••• 

Called the tribal kings of 
"exotica noir," The Blue Hawai-
ians make an impressive debut on 
lnterscope Records with Savage 
Night. Concocting a strange cock-
tail of lounge, surf, pop and spy 
music, The Blue Hawaiians have 
not only carved a place for them-
selves in the music industry, but 
have accomplished the dubious 
task of creating a new genre-
blending style that doesn't incor-
porate today's popular "trailer" 
rap or techno-induced beats. 

"There's a beauty to what we 
do but also a darkness," said 
Mark Fontana, the group's lead 
singer and main songwriter. 
"We're always mixing styles. 
When people try to describe us, 
they end up saying, 'The Blue 
Hawaiians are kinda weird.' We 
take that as a compliment." 

The unique sound to the Blue 
Hawaiians was picked up in 1994 
at Los Angeles' infamous tiki 
palace, The Lava Lounge. Legend 
has it that Quentin Tarantino, a 
lounge lizard himself, was 
strongly influenced by the band's 
dark groove and used similar 
musica l oddities in his film "Pulp 
Fiction." And, the movie's sound-
track is the best approach to 
describing The Blue Hawaiians' 
style. As Tra volta is driving down 
the empty street in his classic con-
vertible with enough heroin to 
kill an elephant, smiling in a half-
dazed funk, we find the band's 
groove between the drive and the 
high. Whatever its definition, 
"Pulp Fiction" did a lot for the 
lounge/tiki band. 

"There was this small cool 
vibe," Fontana recollects. "At first 
there was 15 to 20 people, then 
every Sunday night the crowds 
got bigger and bigger. Seven 
months late, 'Pulp Fiction' came 
out. Suddenly the place was 
packed and there was a two-hour 
wait to get in." Unlike most L.A. 
fads, however, Savage Nigllt 
proves that the band's eclectic 
style and mysterious mood will 
capture even more fans in the 
years to come. 

Savage Night throws you 
beyond happy hour and adds an 
element of the sinister. The cheery 
twang of the Hawaiian steel gui-
tar collides w~h the dark and dra-
matic mood of the Hammond B3 
organ, making the group's rendi-
tions of surf classics into a spooky 
and off-beat homage. Inspired by 
Jim Thompson's gritty crime 
novel Savage Night, the lyrics 
share the same hypnotic effect, 
often delving into the shadowy 
realms of temptation. 

Trying to pinpoint The Blue 
Hawaiians to a particular genre is 
a moot point since the band has 
always kept an "indie" attitude 

when creating music. 
"There have always been musi-

cal twists," Fontana said. "We don't 
fit nicely into a niche. We plotted 
our course whether people went 
with us or not. We were never part 
of a scene. From the beginning, we 
were our own scene."

Lo. ...... 
This Time 

---
-•••• 

Los Lobos have been rocking 
out for so long, you would think 
they may have found something 
that worked and stuck with it. 
But these Latin Rock fusion fron-
tiersmen are not content sitting 
on their laurels, and This Time is 
the proof. 

Like a blend of, well, every-
thing, This Time is graced by 
David Hidalgo's sincere voice 
that wavers between sweet ("Oh 
Yeah") and bluesy ("Viking"). 
The guitars rip ("Why We Wish"), 
and just when you think you 
have these gux,s figured out they 
launch into 'Cumbia Raza," a 
more traditional piece that still 
manages to incorporate several 
different horns while maintaining 
an authentic flavor. 

It is hard to say there is anything 
pecific wrong with the album, but 

there is defini tely something miss-
ing. Perhaps it is the balance, which 
lea r.s dangerously toward rock 
fusion pieces and away from the 
gorgeous ballads they are certainly 
capable of. Because of this, some 
songs bunch together. Still, that is a 
minor complaint for an album that 
proves Los Lobos will continue to 
thankfully test the boundaries of 
modem rock.

Best known for their one hit 
wonder, "Natural One," which 
appeared on the soundtrack to 
the film "Kids," The Folk Implo-
sion have released a new album, 
One Part Lullaby. 

Somewhat aware of their "one 
hit" status, it is not surprising to 
see Lou Barlow, one half of the 
duo, sing "I'm not a rebel or nat-
ural one" on their title song. This 
might be more of a prophetic 
statement since it isn't likely that 
any single hits will emerge from

**** ..... Ient

* .... 

One Part Lllllaby. This is partly 
due to the slow pace that the 55 
minute album chugs through. 
Lyrics such as "killing my sense 
of time" do nothing to speed the 
album's rhythm. The pace of the 
album, however, enhances the 
lush harmonizing and creates a 
unique kind of mood music. 

John Davis, the song writing 
half to The Folk Implosion, shows 
off his former librarian skills by 
crafting philosophical lyrics 
about the meaning of Los Ange-
les, their musical stomping 
grounds. Lyrics such as "Don't 
louch me because I've had too 
much to feel tonight" demon-
strate the sensory overload that 
the city has a propensity to exhib-
it. 

The album's first track, "My 
Ritual," sets up the record's tone 
as it raises and diminishes grind-
ing guitar riffs, a pulsing drum 
loop, and layered vocals. "Serge," 
the album's lone instrumental 
takes a surf-guitar line and mixes 
it into the band's hypnotic 
groove. 

One Part Lullaby offers a vari-
ance of experimental tunes with 
intriguing lyrics about urban sur-
vival. But the album often bor-
ders on a reproachable redundan-
·cy that cannot be saved by its 
spacy sound effects.

"II_.~ 
-•• 

There are some real gems on 
Pocket Size's debut 100% 
Hllmall , but oh the garbage you 
will have to wade through to get 
there. Like a smattering of 
Frente, Portishead and Beth 
Hart, the group shows genuine 
potential but could ultimately 
benefit from another trip to the 
editing room. 

The best tracks incorporate 
varied, rollicking bass lines 
("Miles and Miles," "Shaking the 
Tree") and breathy, catchy cho-
ruses ("Squashy Lemon 
Squeezy"). Unfortunately, many 
o( those same breathy choruses 
are whittled into the ground, as is 
the case in "Tell Me Who" where 
a simple refrain is repeated over a 
trombone solo. Or try to listen to 
the opening "Human Touch," 
which redefines the term "breezy 
pop" without the luster. 

Ambitious yet amateur, Pock-
et Size is still looking for a defin-
ing sound. While they bounce 
from style to style, the listener is 
alienated. The infusion of folk 
and big beats is intriguing, but 
Pocket Size needs to follow 
through and deliver a more con-
cise album. Instead, 100% Hllmall 
is a sprawling mess that only 
occasionally wanders into new 
territory.

Strong Outlook for 
Save Ferris and Eek-A-Mouse will perform at 
By DAVID LEE 
ASSOCIate Hiatus Editor 

ASUCSD will present their 
sec0nd annual Fallfest this Friday 
WIth both daytime "festivities" 
and a nighttime concert. 

What exactly is Fallfest? Sim-
ply, the event celebrates UCSD's 
Homecoming weekend. 
Although Homecoming usually 
suggests a football team and 
images of a stadium-packed 
crowd with plastic cups raised 
high, UCSD concentrates its 
Homecoming on the students and 
the events themselves (maybe 
due to the lack of a football team.) 
Not to say that sports is com-
pletely void from the festival. 
Last year 's Homecoming 
revolved around the men's soccer 
team match against U.S. Interna-
tional University and UCSD Ath-
letics' acceptance of the Sears 
Directors Cup for the best Divi-
sion III athletic program in the 
nation. The Cup was awa rded 
during the halftime show, and 
although there were no clashing 
helmets on the grid iron, plastic 
cu ps were still ra ised in celebra-
tion. 

This year, the nationally 
ranked women's soccer team (12-
1-1) will be facing off in a crucial 
Division III test this Saturday on 
Rimae field. As for the actual 
activities involved, the daytime 
activities this year will be filled 
with various bands at the Price 
Center Plaza . Orquestra 
Primo, a salsa group, will 
be performing from 11 a.m. 
to 1 p.m. Island Fever takes the 

stage next with their unique 
calypso flavor and Mariachi La 
Barca will be serenading students 
throughout the Library Walk 
from 11 :30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. Var-
ious games and contests will 
also be held throughout the 
day. 

Following last year's "Tiki-
Island Reggae Romp" theme, 
this year's nighttime concerts 
will headline reggae veteran 
Eek-a-Mo and main-
st ream

FACULTY: 
UCSD hosts international 
groups such as Tangokinesis 
ContI ....... from ..... 14 
tour nationally, if not internationally. Tan-
gokinesis, the Tango/Modem Dance group 
from Buenos Aires that thrilled a large audi-
ence last Wednesday, is a good example. 
Sometimes however, even the big name 
groups don' t fill the house. Therefore, UCSD 
Presents is featuring some tried-and-true 
local companies who are likely to bring a 
crowd. 

Tried-and-true is far from an understate-
ment. Isaacs is the star example: She has been 
on the cutting edge of modem dance in San 
6:>iego for 25 years, since she and two others 
founded "Three's Company" in 1974. After a 
stint in San Francisco, Isaacs came to San 
Diego with the long-term goal of giving 
direction to the virtually non-existent dance 
scene here. Instead of being intimidated by 
the lack of a strong pre-existing dance com-
munity in which she could continue to train, 
she saw fertile ground waiting for an adven-
turous spirit to plant the seeds of creativity. 

She did that, and tended the seeds as well. 
After teaching countless classes and organiZ-
ing yea rs of shows, workshops, summer 
training sessions and other dance events, 
Isaacs is now reaping the harvest. She is 
appreciated as a choreographer not only by 
critics - from whom she has won numerous 
awards - but also by dancers. 

"From my personal physical perspective, 
Jean's work is some of the most orgdnic work 
I've ever experienced," ~aid dancer and 
choreographer Terry Wilson. "I always want 
to come back to it. When I do, jt speaks to me 
more naturally than any other movement 
I've done. Her work is elusive but present." 

Moreover, not only does she continue to 
make dances for her own company, San 
Diego Dance Theater, but many of the 
dancers whom she has taught over the years 
- including Patricia Rincon, Tonnie Sam-
martano and Wilson, all of whom teach at 
UCSD - have gone on to become choreogra-
phers and teachers in their own right.

20 HIATUS 

WYCLEF: 
Mingling with fans was 
show's only upside 
Continued from pag. 15 
ticked on for an hour, that fun gave 
way to monotony. A funky 10-
minute Parliament jam almost 
redeemed the wasted time, but in the 
end it proved a futile attempt to save 
an already sunken show. 

If there is anything good to be 
said, it is that such a big name let his 
fans get so close. It is a rarity these 
days to see artists venture off the 
stage, and even the obligatory 
encore makes enough performers 
uneasy as it is. But there was Wyc1ef 
in the crowd, playing guitar and 
shaking hands. Look up in the sky 
and there he was aga in, sitting on a 
speaker and signing autographs for 
half an hour after the show. Or peer 
at the stage in wonder when he got 
freaky with Marshall Senior Amelia 
Vassar as the crowd went crazy. 
Never has a star seemed so close, so 
within reach. One girl was even 
a ked to jam with him in the tour 
bus after the show. 

The UCSD Guardian Thursday, October 21, 1999 

To his credit, Wyclef didn't do an 
encore. He didn ' t need to. After all, 
he wasn' t performing for UCSD, he 
was just hanging out with us. How-
ever, he did take a short break" from 
the festivities to go to the bathroom. 
See, even celebrities have to pee. 

• Brian MogIladamj Guardian 
Huh?: Wyclef spent a little too much time letting his deejay run the show by playing snippets of songs by other artists.

DANCE: 
Perfonners care deeply 
about their work 
ContInued from ..... 14 

In the works for three months 
now, the piece was inspired by a 
Paul Theroux quote: "All that 
really matters is that the gyro-
scope within liS still spins and 
stays upright." Dancers will per-
form to live music performed by 
violinist Janos egyesy and 
pianist Aleck Karis, both profes-
sors in the UC D music depart-
ment. 

" It's a very personal piece," 
Isaacs said. "Certainly the part 
about aging; I'm getting older. I 
don' t want to be forgotten ." This 
is a fear of many artists, and not 
without reason. 

Even Martha Gra ham, the 
founder of modern dance in the 
United States, is not immune to 
changing times, something that 
greatly marked Isaacs or. her last 
trip to New York City. 

" I passed by Graham's old 
studio, and it was in ruins," 
Isaacs said "The building was 
aba ndoned, and there were 
posters lying trampled on the 
Ooor. 

tainly need not worry. She is 
always working on a new dance, 
and her work and teaching style 
are in constant evolution. 

"Jean is more than just a 
teacher," said dancer Alison Diet-
terle. "She's a life mentor." Not a 
typical student, Dietterle is 
studying biological anthropology 
even though she already dances 
for Isaacs' company. Before bore-
dom compelled her to go back to 
college, she danced ballet profes-
siona lly for a few years, first for 
the Eugene Ballet Company in 
Oregon and then Ballet Pacifica 
in Irvine. 

"You grow out of ballet," Diet-
terle said. "It's not stimulating. 
Modern dance is different; there's 
places you can go with it beyond 
the structure of set movement. I 
can be myself w hen I dance mod-
ern. Also, there's an intellectual 
side. You need wisdom." 

Dietterle was trying to decide 
between UCLA and UCSD when 
she met Isaacs. "I took a class 
with Jean and decided to come 
here," she said. 

The UCSD Guardian HlATUS 21 

"However, The piece isn't only 
about aging and death," she con-
tinued. " It's also about regenera-
tion. I feel both optimistic and 
blessed, because I have young 
dancers, such as Alison, who 
want to carryon. 

She is not the only student-
turned-company member. UCSD 
alumna Elizabeth Lee moved 
from San Diego to San Francisco 
to Los Angeles, where she cur-
rently lives, but is still tied to 
San Diego.

the whole time," she said . ''I'll

this is the case however, she cer-

In addition to the work by 
Isaacs, the San Diego Dance The-
atre will present the U.S. premiere 
of a comedic piece by Mexican 
choreographer Adriana Casta nos. 
"Las Sirenas Tambien Esperan" 

(The Sirens Are Also Waiting) was 
inspired by an ode to Odysseus. 
The dance humorously depicts 
the plight of Odysseus' 
temptresses as they wait in bore-
dom for men to sail by their 
island. 

The Patricia Rincon Dance 
Collective will also premiere two 
pieces: "Eleanor's Ballade" and 
'Run In." 

'''Eleanor's Ballade' is about 

life is to find beauty in every-
thing. In having to learn that 
there's darkness in life, she gets 
transfonned."

22 HIATUS The UCSD GLl8J'dian Thursday. October 21. 1999 

Boys Will Be Boys DANCE: Performance is this Friday at 8 p.m. 
work with. Also, I'm in a differ-
ent place now, a more emotional 
state. Last winter it was a medi-
tation; now it's a tragic come-
dy." 

The dance starts with Epi-
fano's solo performance to a 
song by Spanish singer Lhasa. 
Dressed in tattered blue si lk, 
she could easily be a tornado as 
she effortlessly swirls up, 
down and around the stage. 
Both she and the other dancers 
move with a deceivingly 
relaxed air. 

Hilary Swank bends all the rules in the new film 'Boys Doni Cry' ContIn •• d fr ......... 21 superego can slowly deterio-
rate one's ego," said Rincon of 
her other work on the program, 
a duet set in a construction 
zone. The set includes a place 
for UCSD professor and per-
cussionist Steven Schick, who 
will be playing the accompani-
ment, a composition by David 
Lang. 

By JEREMY GRAY 
Senior Staff Writer 

Gender-bending - the act of 
passing off a character as. a mem-
ber of fhe opposite sex -IS a pop-
ular theme in movies. Whether 
it 's done fo r laughs (Dustin Hoff-
man in "Tootsie") or shock Oaye 
Davidson in "The Crying Game"), 
gender-bending challenges audi-
ences to see traditional male and 
female roles in a new light. 

The powerful and ambitious 
film "Boys Don't Cry" poses such 
a challenge but adds a twist. 
Rather than focusing on the shock 
that its main character Brandon is 
really a girl, the film instead nar-
rows in on his need for accep-
tance and the love he finds in a 
small town. This love comes from 
both Lana, the girl whom he falls 
for (played by the breathtaking 
and seasoned Chloe Sevigny,) 
and the friends who take him in. 

"Boys Don' t Cry" wastes . no 
time in letting the cat out of the bag, 
as the opening scene shows Bran-
don preparing herself to be a boy. 

"But you' re a gir!!" pleads her 
forgiving cousin, as the sock is 
inserted and the breasts taped up. 
In no time, she has a group of 
angry, drunken. men chasing her 
home, calling her a dyke for kiss-

Brace 

ing their girls. As she laughs 
while windows shatter around 
her, it soon becomes obvious -
she's in it for the thrills. 

Those same thrills lead Teena 
Brandon to Falls City, Neb., 
where she is taken in by a group 
of small-town friends who take a 
liking to her after she gets thor-
oughly walloped in a bar fight. 
Nobody thinks twice about hit-
ting her since they think she's a 
boy named Brandon Teena. 

Soon Brandon is whooping it 
up with the boys, drinking beers 
and "bumper surfing" - hanging 
onto a rope tied to the bed of a 
pickup as it wheels around. 

When Lana asks why he 
would do such a thing, Brandon 
replies, "[ just figured that's what 
boys around here do." 

Acceptance, it seems, is a uni-
versal ' desire. Brandon doesn't 
want to be accepted as a boy; he 
wants to be accepted as one of the 
guys, not the wuss his teeny 
frame suggests he may be. 

Not enough can be said about 
Hilary Swank, whose exceptional 
performance as Teena 
Brandon/Brandon Teena turns 
gender roles upSide-down. Like a 
wussed-out Matt Damon, 
Swank's alter-ego swaggers, spits, 
curses and drinks. [n fact, she 

does such a good job of convinc-
ing the audience she's a boy that 
by the time we see her stripped of 
her mystery, we pray that it is all a 
mistake. We want the magic show 
to go on a little longer. 

Although a gruesome rape 
scene and a disturbing climax 
may taint the theme of the film, 
Kimberly Peirce directs with a 
mostly slow hand and allows the 
story of love and acceptance to 
mature gradually. In fact, we 
don' t realize how much we have 
come to accept Brandon until the 
brutal conclusion. 

Since "Boys Don't Cry" is 
based on a true story, it is by no 
means giving away the ending to 
say that Brandon is tragically 
murdered. 

Beyond all the shock and the 
outrage, beyond all the immorali-
ties and the sinking sensation that 
it's just not fair, the movie asks 
the big question, "Is love blind?" 
The final image of Lana driving 
away from Falls City with a smile 
on her face suggests that it is. 

Brandon's tragic demise liber-
ates a young woman once trapped 
by her life, who having finally 
found acceptance in a gender-bend-
ing love affair, searches to er&lte her 
future rather than sit back and let it 
speed past a setting country sun. 

"It's intelligent music. The 
piece was created specifically 
for th is music," Rincon said . 
"Terry Wilson is the ego, and 
Laurie Muniz the superego. 
You could say that Steven 
Schick is the id. Terry slowly 
gets sucked into the zone of the 
superego, and they have a bat-
tle." 

Some of the dancers from 
the Rincon Collective will also 
dance with San Francisco 
choreographer Kim E?,ifano. 
The work is called ' In the 
Middle of the Eye - The 
Third Storm," in reference to 
the fact that this is its third 
incarnation. The second took 
place last winter when Epi-
fano worked with UCSD stu-
dents for "An Evening of 
Dance." This time around, 
Epifano jOins the dancers 
on stage. 

"1 am the storm now," she 
said. " It's a different piece. My 
work depends a lot on who I 

When the other dancers join 
her, past viewers will notice bits 
and pieces of movement phras-
es left from the last version, but 
the lifts, the relationships 
between the dancers and their 
arrangement on stage have all 
been modified. 

Also, the dancers now 
speak from time to time. The 
piece is definitely showing a 
faScinating evolution; one 
wonders if this is its final form 
or if there will be an "In the 
Middle of the Eye - The 
Fourth Storm." With a wildly 
creative individual like Epi-
fano, one never knows. The 
wisest option is not to miss 
this concert. 

"Cutting the Edge" will be 
performed this Friday night, 
Oct. 22, at 8 p.m. in Mandeville 
Auditorium. 

Tickets prices are: $18 gen-

FACULTY: 
Department members 
also direct institutions 
ContInued from ..... 18 

The modern dance section of 
the UCSD dance department 
reflects Isaacs' influence, as well 
as the fact that some of the most 
talented and influential artists in 
the area ha ve taught here. 

The heart of the department is 
composed of Isaacs, Margaret 
Marshall and Rincon, who all 
direct various institutions in 
addition to being full-time 
tenured UCSD faculty. They head 
the San Diego Dance Theater, the 
San Diego Dance Institute and the 
Patricia Rincon Dance Collective, 
respectively. 

In addition to the previously 
mentioned instructors, other 
well-known artists who teach or 
have taught here include Rin-
con's twin sister Alicia Rincon, 
Faith Jenson-Ismay, the driving 
force behind the Mojalet Dance 
Collective and Nina Martin, who 
after a successful career in New 
York City moved to San Diego 
and started the Lower Left Dance 
Company. 

UCSD and local dance artists 
have an excellent start on a mutu-
ally beneficial relationship; let us 
hope that even more is done in 
this direction.

Not all of UCSD's top athletes are involved in 
Intercollegiate Athletics. Some of these men and 
women can be found in UCSD's Club Sports pro-
gram. 

For those athletes not in the mainstream, or 
those who participate in sports not sanctioned by 
the NCAA, UCSD offers a bunch of Club Sports, 
ranging from surfing, to ballroom dancing, to 
lacrosse, to ultimate disc. 

The GlUlrdian will periodically

can keep current with all fac-
tions of UCSD athletics. In

Expect big wins from the 

UCSD Ice hockey tearns this year. 
Already one game into the season, UCSD has 
knocked off last season's No. 1 team, Cal State 
Northridge, 7-5. 

"It looks like we're goillg to be pretty good 
this year," defender Craig Brown said. 

With last year's talent and this year's new-
comers, the UCSD ice hockey team, which fin-
ished 3rd at last year's ' lieason-ending tourna-
ment, is confident it can win it aU. 

Leading the way against Northridge was fresh-
man Keith Davis who had 5 points, including 3 
goals. If the name sounds familiar, it should. 
Davis' brother, Chris, a returning starter, was a 
dominant force on last year's team. Against 
Northridge the elder Davis chalked up 2 goals. 

"There is definitely some brotherly chemistry 
going on," Brown said.

Faculty Seeks Larger 
Role in Athletic Issues 
INTEGRITY: Staff hopes to end misconduct 
By ERIN GHERE 
Minnesota Daily 

(U-WIRE) MINNEAPOLIS -
University of Minnesota faculty 
members are re-evaluating their 
roles and responsibilities in the 
wake of academic misconduct 
allegations against the men's bas-

In a soon-to-be-released 
report, the Faculty Consultative 
Committee will recommend fac-

The FCC appointed a special 
faculty committee in July to ana-

as frequently as is alleged in the

"We're the enforcers," said his-

Additionally, under Big Ten

" It is a role overseeing how the

University President Mark 
Yudof expressed sUPfort for the 
FCC's examination 0 the faculty

"Academic integrity must be

main goals of teaching, research

By ROBERT FULTON 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD men's soccer team 
had a successful and productive 
two days this past week. 

On Sunday, the Tritons 
downed Briar Cliff College (IA) 
1-0 and the next day, took care of 
The Master 's College 2-1 - this 
all coming off a 0-0 overtime tie 
last week on the road. But noth-
ing will phase this team. 

The guys have been winning 
with skill and luck. 

Actually, in the game against 
The Masters, the visiting team 
connected on more shots than the 
Tritons did, putting two in the net 
to UCSD's one. Fortunately for 
UCSD, one of the two shots by the 
Mustangs was put into their own 
net for an early Christmas present 
to help the Triton cause. 

At the 29:47 mark, after 30 
minutes of lackluster, scoreless 
play in the first half agaif'st The 
Masters, the Mustangs tried to 
deflect a corner pass from 
UCSD's Tyler Thompson. The 
Mustangs successfully deflect'i!d 
the boot, but inadvertently 
directed it into his own goal to 
give UCSD an early 1-0 lead. 

The second half was much 
more physical, with yellow 
cards, warnings and pleads to 
the refs. Tensions were high 
between the two squads.

"George [Hall] is a good ref," 
UCSD Head Coach Derek 
Armstrong said of the head offi-
cial. "He was trying to keep a lid 
on it. He was too cautious." 

The game was filled with shots, 
with the Tritons taking 13 to the 
Masters' 11 . Mustang goalkeeper 
Sean Parson finished the match 
with 4 saves while his Triton coun-
terpart Lucas Curtolo also saved 4. 

In the second half at the 52:01 
point, UCSD gained a more com-
fortable lead. Robert Benomicz 
scored on a pass from Brady 

Bernard on a free kick to make 
the game 2-0. 

The Masters tried to make a 
comeback. The Mustangs' 
Ricardo Bradbury, who played 
most of the game on the defen-
sive side of the ball but moved to 
the forefront late in the game, got 
his team on the board at the 88:08 
mark to make the game 2-1, but 
it was too little too late as UCSD 
held on for the big victory. 

On Sunday, a weary UCSD 
pulled out a win against the visi-
tors from Sioux City. After a two-
hour 0-0 standstill last Wednesday 
and with a game the next night, 
the Tritons tried to conserve their

energy as much as they could 
while at the same time maintain-
ing enough to muster up a victory. 

"We were just trying to save 
their legs," Armstrong said. "I 
tried to give everybody a chance." 

The Tritons were on the board 
in a blink of an eye. Just 70 sec-
onds into their match with the 
Chargers, UCSD's Aleksandar 
Glebov took a pass from Bernard 
to score the game's only goal. 

"We came out pretty fired 
up," Glebov said. "That's what 
we were looking to do. It was a 
good result. We're getting better 
and working with each other." 

The rest of the first half was 

slow playing while the second 
half showed some great defense 
as the Tritons tried to conserve 
players and still get the win. 

Everybody got into the game 
and UCSD pummeled Briar Cliff 
with 19 shots while the visiting 
team only managed eight. Curtolo 
only had to save three shots while 
Briar Cliff's Brandon Schuchard 
was forced to save five. 

"We hit the pole twice today," 
Armstrong said. "I think I upset 
the rhythm by changing." 

The rested and confident 
Tritons will defend an eight-
game streak against Westminster 
College of Utah Friday at 7 p.m.

Tritons Destroy Briar 
SHUTOUT: Twelve goals send Chargers packing 
By ROBERT FULTON 
Staff Writer 

A lazy Sunday afternoon 
deserves a walk in the park. 

This past Sunday, the UCSD 
Women's Soccer Team - one of 
the most dominating teams on 
campus - had little trouble 
defeating Briar Cliff College of 
Iowa at home. Final score: 12-0. 

What kinds of memories of 
San Diego did the lady 
Tritons send the team 
from Sioux City back 
home with? 

For starters, 
there are the two 
goals and one 
assist for UCSD's Erika 
Alfredson. Or perhaps the 
Briar Cliff Chargers will best 
remember Cindy Dostalek's two 
goals, or maybe the pair scored 
by Lauren Jacobs. Maybe the two 
shots scored by Heidi Bork will 
give Briar Cliff nightmares. 

Other things that probably 
made the ride home to Iowa bad 
included the 35 shots that UCSD 
plummeted Briar Cliff with, led 
by Jessica Cordova who took 
seven, and the one shot Iowa 
countered with. 

All possibilities aside, the 
Chargers' trip to UCSD will be 
one they will soon wish to forget 
as they were dominated in all 
facets of the game. 

"You learn about styles of 
play," Alfredson said of playing 
teams from around the country. 
"You get a variety." 

The Tritons quickly got on the 
board at the 2:26 mark when 
Dostalek scored her first goal off a 
Christy Abizaid pass to make the 
game 1-0. Teammate Laura Dooly 
soon followed that up with a shot 
of her own at the 13:53 point in 
the half to make the score 2-0. 

After a slight drought, the 
Tritons went on a tear to 

close out the half. 
Alfredson 

scored her tirst 
goal from another 
Abizaid pass at 

the 30:45 point. Less than 
four minutes later, Emily 

Scheese accepted a pass from 
Elizabeth Hughes for yet another 
score. To close out the half, Bork 
scored her first goal, giving the 
Tritons a 5-0 lead to end the half. 

If it had not been for the two 
teams switching sides at the half, 
the field would have been obvi-
ously worn on one side, as the 
Tritons stepped up their domina-
tion in the second period. 

Two goals from Jacobs at the 
47:22 and 63:02 marks and a score 
by Bork at the 54:41 point quickly 
made the game 8-0. 

NWe're coming together well,"
