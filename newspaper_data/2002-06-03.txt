A.S. Council seeking 
'budget solutions 

Gov. Davis on hand to bre·ak 
ground for new buildings 
Facilities hailed as integral to state Debate over use of reserve 

money stalling passage By DANIEL WArn 
By LAURA McGANN 
Staff Writer 

The A.S. Council is entering the 
final week of the quarter without an 
internal budget, due to a debate over 
whether to supplement the proposed 
budget with money from its mandat-
ed reserves. 

Mandated reserves are funds cre-
ated by student fees that are aved 
each year for the A.s. Council for 
emergency situations. 

"Mandated reserves is for A.S. to 
have money set aSIde for a variety of 
reasons - it could be used in the case 
of an emergency," said A.S. advisor 
Paul Dewine. "It could be for pro-
grams that weren't successful and 
need to be supplemented. I t is also 
money on reserve so that new pro-
grams can be initiated - it's essen-
tially to help support the A.S. in 
everythi ng that it does." 

He added that it is also "a respon-
si ble thing for them to do: have 
money in reserves in case something 
unforeseen happens." 

The current budget proposal uses 
mandated reserve money to fund 
A.S .Council travel expenses and 
administrative supplies and expenses, 
totaling $53,550 out of an account of 

$800,000. 
A.S. President Jenn Brown 

explained her decision to supplement 
these programs by comparing the sit-
uation to last year 's budget. 

"r decided to spend money from 
our mandate reserves for a couple of 
our programs because the A.S. last 
year spent a lot of money from our 
enterprise reserves - about the same 
as this year: $50,000," Brown said . "r 
am doing the exact same thing that 
Jeff Dodge did last year. He just did-
n't tell anyone that he was doing it 
and ram." 

Maintaining the funding of past 
programs versus maintaining the 
$800,000 emergency reserve pot has 
become a contentious issue. 

Some A.S. Council members 
believe that an untouched pot of 
reserve money is more valuable than 
program funding. 

"I personally feel very uncomfort-
able with it," said Wendy Ho, 
Eleanor Roosevelt College's senior 
senator. "The mandated reserves are 
there for dire circumstances. I think 
that should be an untouched pot. I'd 
rather see programs being cut than 
money being taken out. They are our

Gov. Gray Davis and 

Qualcomm founder Irwin 
Jacobs broke ground on 
UCSD's two new two engineer-
ing buildings in a ceremony 
held at Earl Warren College on 
May 31 in front of a crowd of 
over 330 students, politicians, 
UCSD faculty and entrepre-
neurs. 

Davis and Jacobs, along with 
UC President Richard Atkinson 
and UCSD Chancellor Robert 
Dynes, dedicated the California 
institute for Telecommunications 
and lnfonnation Technology and 
the Computer Science and 
Engineering Building by digging 
the first few shovels of dirt at the 
Warren construction site after a 
number of short speeches. 

"Each time we break ground 
on a new campus building, I 
believe we lay a foundation for 
new ideas and for new genera-
tions of learners," Dynes said. 

The speakers · concentrated 
primarily on the UC's partner-
ships with corporations like 
Qualcomm, on UCSD's techno-
logical research and on its impact 
on the economy.

Lecturers rally for new contract Administration will 
prosecute Koala again 
Rescheduled hearing to be 
held Wednesday evening 

Complaints 
vary from pay 
to job security 
By CARLAN WENDLER 
Senior Staff Writer 

UCSD lectures rallied in the 
Price Center and then marched to 
the chancellor's office May 30 to 
express their displeasure with their 
current contract. 

For two years, the lecturers 
claim, the University of California 
has been bargaining in bad faith, 
forcing them to pursue alternative 
means of communicating their 
complaints. The lecturers' main 
complaints are the salary system 
that does not take into account 
seniority or performance, little job 
security, and extended negotiability 
in the contract. 

Lecturers are' nontenure-track 
instructors, who are not assistant, 
associate or full - time professors. 
They have the specific function of 
teaching classes. They are hired for 
one quarter or a series of quarters 
to teach classes. 

Both sides agree that lecturers 
teach about half of UC classes. 
UCSD employs fewer lecturers 
than the UC average. 

The current dispute began two 
years ago, when the previous con-
tract expired.

between the University of California 
and the University Council-

which represents the lecturers.

T he UCSD administration 
will be given another chance to 
present its case against the Koala 
at a newly rescheduled campus-
wide judicial board hearing 
scheduled for the evening of June 
5. 

The rescheduled hearing 
comes after Director of Student 
Policies and Judicial Affairs 
Nicholas Aguilar nullified the 
May 22 proceedings, where

motion to exclude members of 
the campus media from attending 
the hearing was denied by Judicial 
Board Presiding Officer Parisa 
Baharian. 

Koala principal member 
Jeremy Rode said he is confident 
the judicial board will rule in the 
Koala's favor, regardless of the 
administration's plans to retry the 
student organization. 

"I'm compl etely optimisti c 
because the facts are on our side," 
Rode said. "Al l be revealed on

Hearing: 
Media in proceedings 
warranted nullification 
Continued from page 1 
Aguilar said Baharian 's ruling to 

admi t media into the proceedings 
conflicted with the university's duty to 
defend students ' right to privacy. 

"Student disciplinary matters have 
consistently been conducted as co nfi -
dential proceedings in accordance 
with UCSD Srudent Conduct Code 
Sections 22 .17 .16.16.a and 
22. 17. 16.16.b," Aguilar stated in an e-
mail to the Guardian. 

Koala Editor in Chief George 
Liddle said the administration's nulli -
fication was illegitimate. 

"As far as the Koato 's stance on the 
nullification, we think it is totally 
unjustified," Liddle said. "It's just an 
exam ple of the university cheating 
under its own rules." 

Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Joseph W. Watson corroborated 
Aguilar'S reasoning for nullifying the 
May 22 proceedings, saying the policy 
is designed to protect students ' priva-
cy. 

"Whether a case of student miscon-
duct has either a great deal of media 
and public interests or none, it is tlle 
admmistrations obligation to en ure 
the II1tegrity of the procedures and the 
protection of the rights of the accllsed, 
accusers and witnesses," Watson stated 
111 an ernal! to the Guardiall. 

[11 a May 20 pre-hearing confer-
ence, Baharian rejected the universi-
ty 's objection to media presc"ce dur-
ing thc proceedings, basing her deci-
sion on documents presented by 
Gllardlall editors, including federal 
and state interpretations of the 
Family Educa tion and Rights to 
Privacy Act. 

At the pre-hearing trial , Baharian 
said that it was her duty to rule on the 
presence of nonparties at the meeti ng 
per section 22 .17. 16. 15 c, which man-
dates that the "presiding officer may 
solicit and rule upon any challenges 
under ection 22. 17.16.16." 

The Student Conduct Code also 
allows the presiding officer to make 
rulings that would " ... assure that the 
hearing is conducted fair ly and effi-
cientl y" during the pre-trial hearing. 

At the May 20 meeting, Baharian 
said that opening the hearing to cam-
pus media would further legitimize 
the proceedings. 

Section 22. 17. 16.16a of the 
UCS D Student Conduct Code cites 
that judicial board hearings "will 
normally be treated as confidential 
and closed to the public unless oth-
erwise agreed to by all accused sru-
dent(s) and participating individuals 
including witnesses, who are entitled 
to a claim of right to privacy under 
UCSD regulations." 

Despite Baharian's reasoning, 
Watson said the administration can 
invalidate the decision on grounds of 
procedural error, which they say apply 
to Baharian's actions. 

"In order to protect the rights of 
the parties directly involved in a case 
and ensure the fairness and integrity 
of the hearing process, the adminis-
tration has the right and the obliga-
tion to take actions to correct judicial 
board procedural actions," Watson 
stated. 

The Student Conduct Code also 
entails the process by which the case is 
opened to the public, which includes 
making a written request to the 
appropriate dean five days prior to the 
hearing. 

As of press time, Liddle was the 
only involved party who sa id he 
requested an open hearing. 

The KOII/a faces charges of violat-
ing conduct code when it allegedly 
participated in the "disruption of a 
UCSD event" when members of the 
Koala attended a meeting of the 
Movrniento Esrundiantil Chicanalo 
de Aztlan on November 19, 200 1.

Student Conduct Code is available

UCSD professor wins highest 
award among uc professors 

UC President Richa rd C. Atkinson awarded the 
University of Califomia Presidential Medal to Richard 
A. Lemer on May 3 1 at the UCSD School of 
Engineering Sixth Annual Recognition Banquet. 

The UC Presidential Medal was established to 
recognize "Extraordinary contributions to the 
University of California or the community of learn-
ing:' 

Lerner is president of the Scripps Research 
Institute. His 3D-year scientific career encompasses a 
range of biomedical research. His most recent work 
involves groundbreaking discoveries of converting 
antibodies into enzymes, which permits the catalysis 
of chemical reactions once thouWlt impossible to 
achieve through dassical chemical procedures. The 
result has been the possibility of producing antibod-
ies ovemight that would be more efficient than nat-
ural enzymes. 

Lerner has also been a member of the National 
Academy of Sciences since 1991 and was named to 
the Governor's Council on Bioscience in 1999.

ATCHING CALIFORNIA'S BUDGET 
Painful tax hikes are needed to 

. preserve Important programs 
By CLAIRE J. VANNmE 
Senior Staff Writer 

Boy, Gov. Gray Davis is quite a 
man. 

Faced with a looming budget 
cris is in stark contrast ro the halcy-
on days at the beginning of his 
term, Davis is setting his teeth and 
getting rcady to make the hard 
deci)ions. 

According ro Davis, desperate 
times ca ll for desperate measures, 
and we all have to pitch in. Look, 
he seems to say, I 'm even jeopar-
dizing my political future by call-
ing for tax hikes! Look how much 1 
love California l 

However, it is increasingly clear 
that his "desperate measures" are 
not only ill conceived and insu1fi-
cien t, but in fact motivated by 
political strategizing in the face of 
Novembers election. 

It's a strange logic, but it goes 
like this: Davis gambles that voters 
will see him as a guy with rough 
stuff, willing to do something 
unpopu lar like raise taxes - in an 
election year! a close one, too! -
because it's the "right thing to do." 
In fact, Davis' tax hikes are a ban-
dage on the gushing cuts he's mak-
ing to some of California's most 
necessary programs. 

I'm nO( talking about sweet, lib-
eral causes such as arts funding -
which I favor, but can bear to part 
wi th in hard times. His plan calls 
for deep cuts to stare health care 
for poor Californ ians, and, while it 
doesn 't take any cash from K-12 
education, and cuts to higher edu-
cation are slim, maintaining spend-
ing at or around current levels isn't 
goi ng to pull us up at all. 

H ealth care and education in 
this state are already in the dump-
ster, consistently lagging at the 
back of the national pack. 

If we want to improve the long-
term prospects for California's 
economy, it's going to take money. 
We can't rely on tobacco settle-
ments to get us through this 
crunch: Taxes must be rai sed. 

I c's a truism that education is 
the key to ensuring a qualified 
workforce for the future, but that's 
not all. 

A state that wants and needs to 
be business-friendly also has to be 
employee-friendly. What parent 
wants to live and work in a state with 
terrible schools) Sure, some poor 
families whose children are in the 
very worst schools don't have the 
option ofieaving the state for green-
er pastures, bur they may make the 
sacrifice if California's cost of living 
keeps rising while wages stay low; 
and middle class families feeling the 
pinch from the economic downturn 
may head east as well . 

Public schools need more 
money for more teachers, better 
facilities and flexible funding for 
innovative programs like the ones 
being tested with great success at 
UCSD's own Preuss School, the 
budget of which D avis .has cut into 
deeply. 

You want vouchers? T hey' re 
worth a try, but they aren't free, 
either. And don't forget about all 
those remedial classes you're goi ng 
to have to give kids who attended 
private schools that don't adhere to 
instructiona l standards.

Raising taxes will burden the 
successful, so cut pork programs 

By RYAN DARBY 
Senior Staff Writer 

It 's been sai d that if th e 
Democrats were in charge of the 
Sahara Desert, there'd be a short-
age of sand . Case in point: Gov. 
Gray D avis has managed to turn 
our state's unprecedented $8 billion 
budget surplus into a staggering 
$4.5 billion deficit within four 
yea rs. 

Liberals are now proposing that 
the taxpayers foot the bill for 
Dufus' poor planning and excessive 
spending. I have a better idea: Let' 
oust him in favor of someone capa-
ble of drafting a fiscally responsible 
budge t tha t doesn't pi ace even 
more burden upon California's ta~ ­
payers. 

My primary aversion to taxation 
stems from my principle that we 
should be able to keep the money 
we earn and the government 
should stay out of our lives as much 
as possible . Pave the roads, make 
sure our country doesn 't get invad-
ed, and don 't let anyone kill me or 
steal my stuff - that's all I ask from 
the government, and that 's all I 
want to reccivc. 

My secondary dislike of taxation 
- especially high taxation - is 
that it effectively stunts the econo-
my. A good general rule of thumb is 
never to bite the hand that feeds 
you, yet liberals seem to want to 
starve beca use business feeds our 
economy, and therefore our way of 
life. 

Socialism had no part in provid -
ing UCSD with a great- although 
boring - campus, with good pro-
fessors and outstanding facilities . 
It's the taxes generated by the rev-
enues of business - not in spite of 
them - that afford our state such 
good schools. Raise taxes, however, 
and you might lind that the UC 
Regents will be left with fewer 
monetary resources. 

The more the state taxes and 
redistributes wealth, the less likely 
people are to establish successful 
businesses within its borders ; 
there's a reason businesses are 
migrating to other states and 
industry is being established in 
other countries where - God for-
bid -labor is cheaper. Interesting, 
isn't it, how liberal legislation is 
actually the unwitting cause of 
globalization? 

Taxes and regulations are so 
hostile toward business in this state 
that we can't afford to raise them 
any further because more business-
es would be sure to bolt. The state 
would lose, because many potential 
tax dollars would be happily accept-
ed by other, friendlier states; the 
people would lose because those 
businesses would take their poten-
tial job openings along with them; 
and everyone eventually loses 
again, because theres less money 
floating around the state economy. 

It's absolutely absurd to give the 
state more tax money because 
Dufus is apparendy unable to draft 
a feasible budget. His ridiculous 
budget is absolutely put to shame, 
however, by an even larger monu-
ment of idiocy - the $10 billion he 
paid for energy that, as it turns out, 
we didn't really need in the first 
place. 

This highl y overpriced energy

Joseph Roger O'Dell was executed July 23, 1997, via lethal 
injection in Virginia. He 
was pronounced dead 
at 9:15 p.m. 

What is wrong with this pic-
ture ? Despi te the obvious inhu-
mane nature of capital punishment, 
the crux of the problem in this case 
is what didn't occur. 

O'Dell was arrested in 1985 for 
the murder, rape and sodomy of 
Helen Scharmer. He was convicted 
of these crimes over a year later 
based largely on blood evidence 
and the word of a jailhouse 
"snitch." Semen samples were pre-
served from the crime scene but 
untested. 

In a letter dated Aug. 16, 1988, 
to the Hon. Judge H. Calvin Spain 
of the Circuit Court of Virginia 
Beach, O'Dell requested that the 
semen samples be released into the 
custody of a DNA fingerprinting 
lab for testing. 

O'Dell wrote, "If the 
Commonwealth of Virginia refuses 
to allow me this chance, then it is 
goi'ng to appear that they are hid-
ing something, and further, it will 
appear that DNA fingerprinting is 
being used only to convict accused 
persons. This is an opportune time 
for law enforcement to prove that 
they protect the innocent as well as 
prosecute the guil ty." 

However, this request to test the 
one piece of evidence that could 
have cleared him was denied . 

Multiple doors of the criminal 
justice system slammed shut in 
O'Dell's face, effectivel y concealing 

the truth from ever becoming 
known. 

O'Dell 's request to the court 
was denied. His appeals to the 
Virginia Supreme Court and U.S. 
Supreme Court to force Virginia to 
release the DNA samples for test-
ing were denied . 

In his dissent, Supreme Court 
Justice Harry Blackmun found 
"serious questions as to whether 
O 'Dell committed the crime" and 
warned of "the gross injustice that 
would result if an innocent man 
were sentenced to death." 

Now the world will never know 
whether O'Dell was truly guilty or 
completely innocent, as he main-
tained he was until the lethal injec-
tion that ended his life. 

Following his death , O'Dell's 
wife and the Roman Catholic 
Diocese of Richmond, Va. , 
attempted to clear his name and 
petitioned the circuit court of 
Virginia Beach to release the evi-
dence for DNA testing. Yet the 
court once again turned a blind eye 
to the interests of truth and justice 
and denied the appeal. 

In March 2000, the last of the 
DNA evidence in the O'Dell case 
stored in the circuit court of 
Virginia Beach was burned without 
any further testing. 

H ow dare the criminal courts 
and Commonwealth of Virginia 
obstruct the process of justice and 
take that man's life! 

The actions of the courts, com-
monwealth and governor of 
Virginia are criminal and rise to the 
standard of obstruction of justice. 

The DNA testing could have 
proven O'Dell's claims of inno-
cence, yet the courts and common-
wealth repeatedly obstructed all 
avenues for O 'Dell to prove it . 

Why did this obstruction occur? 
Because, in the end, one life doesn't 
matter as much as safeguarding the 
reputation of the Commonwealth

was largely bought for no reason, 
because the public has responded 
very well to energy conservation 
calls . Furthermore, our energy 
rates appear that they will remain 
doubled over the next 10 years. 
Best of all, the vast majority of the 
electricity Dufus bought has 
proved largely unnecessary -
around $7 billion will apparently 
go to waste. 

This state taxes us far too 
much as it is. A set fee of S 1,054 is 
charged to the highest income 
bracket - starting at S23,950 -
and taxes at 9.3 percent for every 
dollar on top of that. If you earn 
S100,000 per year, you forfeit 
S8,127 just in California state 
income taxes. That doesn't even 
include state property taxes, let 
alone federal taxes. With all 
things considered, if you're suc-
cessful in this state, you wind up 
giving about 60 percent of your 
income back to the government. 
Sorry, but theres something not 
right about that. Can you say 
"socialism"? 

After all, we 're taxed so high 
because of all the expensive pro-
grams and waste idolized by Left 
Coast liberals. More money to

During Dufus' four years in

OPINION 5 

Liberal crusaders may be wonder-
ing, " How can those states main-
tain a vas t netwo rk of social pro-
grams?" Well , I suppose they 
don 't. 

Believe it or not, rhere is life 
out there without expensive social 
programs. Although it would 
surely bother me to no e nd if I 
were referred to as a "barbarian" 
for making such a sacrilegious 
statement before the gods of acad-
emia, I do believe there was a 
thing called "art" long before fed-
eral funding. 

I won 't even start ranting 
about how the state is at fault for 
the welfare dependency that has 
devastated much of the state's 
black population, because I'd 
need a whole other article for 
that. All I'll say for now is that the 
reason the black middle class is 
growing larger than the corre-
sponding lower class has 
absolutely nothing to do with 
social programs such as welfare, 
but with hard work and dedica-
tion. 

We 're facing increased sales 
taxes next year because of Dufus' 
blunders over the pas r four years. 
H e has proven that he's just 
another ta~-and-spend liberal who 
wants the federal government to 
take a hit because of his fi sca l irre-
sponsibility. Ifhe wins the upcom-
ing election, he will be the only 
victor, because the people o f 
California will continue to lose. 
We experienced blackouts in 
2001 ; let's see a Gray-out in 2002. 

because you're not one of them 
and you don 't know anyone who

First of all, they call in sick to

California 's economy. T hat's lost

6 OPINION THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Column: 
Life and death lie in the 
the justice system 
Continued from page 5 

1MC students get the shaft 
Housing, construction nuisances abundant 

of Virginia and its criminal ju tice 
system. 

All it takes is the publicity from 
one case of an innocent man mur-
dered by the state for the cracks in 
the criminal justice system to widen 
and gape dangerously open. And, 
like a house of ca rds, our cracked 
and crippled crial justice system 
will collapse .under the weight of its 
own corruption. 

DNA evidence testing is the 
antidote to ensure that the inno-
cenr arc not convicted or executed. 
Though there is no longer any 
hope or DNA evidence to conclu-
sively prove O'Dell's innocence, it's 
not too late for the other O'Delis 
Ollt there. 

What happened to O'Dell must 
not happen to other convicts. 

DNA evidence testing is used 
every day to find and convict per-
petrators of crimes, yet when it 
CO IllCS to testing previously unte t-
ed DNA evidence to clear the con-
victed, legal roadblocks arc enact-
ed . Currently, only H states allow 
DNA tcsti ng on appeal processes. 

Spearheaded by civi I rights 
groups, DNA testing has recently 
provcn the innocence of, and freed, 
110 inmates across the counrry. 
Accordi ng to the May 31 

As~uciatcd Press investig3tive 
report by Shuon Cohen and 
Debora h Hastings, these 110 inno· 
ce nt men served a total of ovcr 
1,000 years in prison . 

The t\P report reveals that the 
inmates' wrongful convictions fo l-
low certain patterns. early rwo-
thirds were convicted with mistak-
en testimony from victims and eye-
witnesses. About 14 percent were 
imprisoned a fter mistakes or 
alleged misconduct by forensics 
expe rts. Nine were mentally 
retarded or borderline retarded 
and confessed, they sa id , after 
bei ng tricked or coerced by 
authorities. 

Clearly, our judicial system is 
severely flawed if those 110 men 
were wrongfully convicted in tile 
first place. 

How many more innocent peo-
ple are behind bars or awaiting 
death for crimes they didn't com-
mit? 

Allowing universal DNA testing 
on appeals is the only way to safe-
guard the rights of all. It is the only 
way to protect the innocent.

As Grace Pineda sat in her 
physics class, she wondered what 
smclled funny. 

"Then I realized it was me -
it was my shoes," said the 
Marshall sop homore. 

Indeed, P ineda had stepped in 
a pile of shi t, except it was in thc 
form of manure being used to 
help replant the grass outside of 
her apartment. 

UCSD has begun renovating 
the Thurgood Marshall College 
Lower Apartments while there 
are still students living in them. 

" I wake lip to people pound-
ing on the roof and that beeping 
noise of trucks backing up, and 
then I can't even study in my own 
room," Pineda said. "Our unique 
view of passers-by and greenery 
has been replaced by dirt and 
noise. II 

To add to this inconvenience, 
this yea r 's construction of 
sophomore housing at Mar hall 
comes on the heels of living 
through the construction of 
Pangea Parking Structure and 
the renovation of Ocean View 
Terrace last year. 

" In 'S' building lin the 
Marshall Residence Halls, next 
to Pangea Parking Structurel 
last year, there was a big 
machine right outside of our 
window lilt the tim e," sa id 
Marshall sophomore Ashwin 
Chandra. "J t just kind of sucked, 
and even though they were 
doing it for the betterment of 
the school, they could have done 
it during summer." 

It's commendable that the 
university is trying to improve 
the living conditions at UCSD, 
but itshouldn'tdo it while people 
are still living there. 

Should this year's Marshall 
sophomores just call it all bad 
timing and forget about it? 
Forget about the fact that ovr 
was closed last year and La 
Casa, the "substitute" restau-
rant, was closed on weekends 
and only stayed open until 3:3 0 
p.m. on Fridays? Forget that 
Marshall sophomores have to 
live through the renovation of 
the lowers so that next year's 
residents will have nicer apart-
ments? Forget that they're the 
first class at UCSD to not have 
guaranteed second-year hous-
ing.

fee referendum that goes toward 
the renovation of a Price Center 
that we may not be around to 
enjoy, it is too much to ask stu-
dents to just suck it up and say, 
"at least it'll be nice next year." 

How about some kind of 
compensation for having to deal 
with construction and for living 
without the facilities that other 
students normally have? 

Or how about at least toning 
down the construction during 
thc school year to be fairer to stu-
dents? 

Construction in the lowers 
usually lasts only a few hours. It 
could easi ly start at around II 
a.m. and still gct the sa me 
amount donc. 

Many of the luxuries 
that make UCSD such 

a nice place to go to 
school - 15-minute 

paSSing periods, open 
space outside to 
enjoy, close-knit 

college communities 
- are disappearing as 

the school rapidly 
expands. 

Sophomore Danica Dodds 
expressed unhappiness with the 
schools idea of being considerate 
of its residents. 

"They tol d us I ast year tha t 
they would be nice during finals 
week, and start construction at 9 
a.m. instead of the usual 8," she 
said. "What happened to 24-
hour quiet hours?" 

Maybe our school is too 
focused on building itself rather 
than building a good relationship 
with its students. 

UCSD is going to have new 
buildings, a sixth college, nicer 
dining halls and other aestheti-
cally pleasing things, but at what 
cost? The new students being 
admitted to Sixth College mean 
that fewer second-year students 
than ever will live on campus 
next year. 

Many of the luxuries that 
make UCSD such a nice place to 
go to school - 15 -minute pass-
ing periods, open space outside 
to enjoy, close-knit college com-
munities - are disappearing as 
the school rapidly expands and 

admits more students. 
UCSD should make more 

efforts to connect with its stu-
dents. The university does not 
have to renovate buildings to 
keep us happy; the time and 
money could be much bener 
spent on providing better classes 
and more activities. It could even 
be something simple, such as 
later hours for the library, gym 
and activity centers. 

But instead of having a foot-
ball team or a fun place to hang 
out at night, we get construction 
that will result in only moderate-
ly better facilities. 

When you wake up to pound-
ing on your roof at 9 3.1ll . and 
then trod off to a 300-seat lecture 
hall, it's hard to escape feeling 
like you're just another member 
of the herd. 

"It's obvious that we as snl-
dents are not the top priori ty of 
UCSD," said sophomore Cliff 
McEnery. He pointcd out that 
the school is often involved in 
o ther endeavors that may be 
detrimental to students ' educa-
tion . 

For example, nlany tudents 
theorize that the university want-
ed to finish ovr by summer 
2001 to entice the San Diego 
Chargers into staying here for 
spring training. 

"I find it very ironic that the 
school closed down OVT all of 
last year to keep the Chargers 
using UCSD for spring training, 
meanwhile leaving Marshall resi-
dents scurrying around for din-
ing," McEnery said, "and now 
the Chargers are leaving UCSD 
anyway." . 

Whether this tumor is true, 
students are feeling alienated for 
one reason or another. Corning 
to this school is a privilege, but 
that doesn't mean that the uni-
versity can act like we're not pay-
ing thousands of dollars to be 
here. 

Maybe UCSD needs to pay 
more attention to getting its 
instructors better contracts 
instead of building new lecture 
halls. It should also be more con-
siderate of the students that it 
already has before cramming in a 
few hundred more. 

Most kids can deal with an 
older lecture hall and can live 
without a state-of-the-art office 
building - what's important in 
college is community. 

And that's something you 
can 't grow with manure.

productivity. 

Secondly, and more importantly, 
they don't just lie around their hous-
es sniffling. They visit the emer-
gency room. They come when they 
have bronchitis, when they need 
stitches in their hands and when 
their babies have a mild fever. They 
do this because they don't have any-
where else to go. 

The last thing anyone in this state 
needs is morc bodies in our already-
overtaxed emergency rooms. 

I believe that Sacramento law-
makers feel the sa me way. But, 
because of well-reasoned political 
beliefs or fear at the prospect of 
upcoming elections, they are 
unwilling to do what needs to be 
done: Take a deep breath and raise 
taxes. 

I have great respect for fiscal 
conservatives who believe in a 
smaller government. I agree with 
them - in principle. However, the 
reality I see is one in which 
Californ ia is in serious trouble, and 
we need tile government's help for 
the time being. That can't happen 
unless we're all willing to make sac-
rifices to keep things up and run-
ning until times improve. 

Currently, Davis wants to raise 
vehicle-l icensing fees to around the 
level they were at when he took 
office. T hat would more than dou-
ble t he fees paid by average 
Californian frol1l $64 annually to 
$148 annually. Also, he wants to 
increase cigarette taxes by 50 cents 
per pack. These hikes would bring 
in around $1.7 billion for the state 
next year and are a good idea . 

Sure, smokers complain that 
they're being unfairly burdened \vith 
these ever-increasing excise taxes, 
but their habit costs the state quite a 
pretty penny in medical costs - and 
we can only hope that higher costs 
will lead to less tobacco use, leading 
to a healthier California. Sure, no 
one wants to pay more at the DMV, 
but we've all got to tighten our belts 
wherever possible if this state is 
going to stay afloat. 

In short, this is a good start. 
More, however, has to be done. 
The programs that Davis is cutting 
are valuable. The programs Davis 
is maintaining at current, paltry 
levels need more, Davis has to exer-
cise some leadership (which is not 
his strong suit, to be sure) and 
guide Californians through a 
painful, but necessary, process. 

Is it the divinely decreed duty of, 
government to take care of all this? 
Essentially, no, but who else has the 
wherewithal to accomplish it) How 
else will it get done? And if you can 
honestly say that yo u don't care -
that hard-working people who 
can't afford to see a doctor, ()vcr-
taxed emergency rooms and failing 
schools don 't bother you - then 
head to a different country, one 
where government isn't willing to 
step up to the plate and make 
things better for its citizens. Send 
me a postcard when you're ready to 
come home. I'll save a place in my 
mailbox. 

[ wish I were an economics 
major and could tell Davis how to 
begin raising taxes. Something tells 
me, though, that he has a stable of 
analysts with plans already hatched 
and waiting; Davis, however, is 
afraid to listen because of a threat 
called Bill Simon - a highly elec-
table threat who opposes tax hikes, 
just like everybody who's ever writ-
ten a check to the IRS or winced 
while making a big-ticket purchase. 

But don't think taking 2 middle 
road of complacency will keep you 
in office, Davis. Democrats are 
starting to see through your game, 
and wc 're thinking of taking our 
votes elsewhere, because you're not 
really willing to take the tough 
stands a governor needs to make. 

And if Davis is losi ng tile vote of 
a dyed-in-the-wool Democrat likc 
me, how can he ever hopt: to win in

Student wins civil suit after 
being banned from campus 
University of Colorado to pay $40,000 

(U-WlRE) BOULD ER, Colo. 
What Carlos Martinez 

describes as the University of 
Colorado's "worst case ever" is 
over. 

The university has paid him 
$40,000 to settle his civil lawsuit. 

"We have resolved the matter," 
Martinez said via telephone from 
San Francisco on Tuesday. "It's 
settled. " 

Documents detailing the legal 
settlement, obtained by the 
CQlorado Daily through an open-
records request, represent the end 
of nearly two years of litigation 
between Martinez and the univer-
sity. 

A philosophy student now 
attending law school at Santa Clara 
University in Calif., Martinez 
argued his own case in court, best-
ing CU lawyers by reversing his 
ban from campus and then winning 
the settlement. 

The ordeal stems from a May 
2000 incident when Martinez was 
told to stay off campus property. He 
was not allowed to attend classes, go 
to his job at the university law library 
or take advantage of his health care 
plan. 

But his troubles began months 
earlier in November 1999, when he 
confronted workers in the universi-
ty bursar's office after more than 
$100 in parking fines were charged 
to his STUdent account. He told 
workers he had paid the tickets and 
then complained to their supervi-

sors that his complai11l had been 
ignored. 

In turn, CU employees com-
plained about Martinez's 
demeanor. They told CU's Office 
of Judicial Affairs that Martinez 
was threatening. Reviews and hear-
ings conducted by the CU Office 
of Judicial Affairs followed, led by 
Andrea Goldblum, the former 
director of Judicial Affairs who left 
her job last week. 

Martinez was banned from the 
campus and ordered to attend ' 
anger management classes if he 
wanted to return. The university 
also required Martinez to write a 
letter of apology to an employee at 
the bursar's office. That letter 
became an item of contention 
because Martinez protested writing 
it after Goldblum wa11led the 
authority to approve its contents. 

It all spurred Martinez to 
begin the first of his several bat-
tles with the university in court. 
In Boulder District Court, he 
convinced a judge that his due 
process rights had been violated 
by the university, winning a rever-
sal of hi s ban from campus in 
January 2001. 

"Nei ther Ithe] initial expulsion 
nor the .. . review of that expulsion 
are supported by competent evi-
dence and each is therefore an 
abuse of discretion," Judge athan 
Hale wrote. 

Ma rt inez then filed a civil 
laWSUit naming the CU Board of 

Regents, CU-Boulde r 
Chancellor Richard Byyny and 
CU President Elizabeth 
Hoffman, asking at one point for 
$1 million in damages. The uni -
versity hired two outside law 
firms for help before reaching 
the settlement. 

Under the terms of the settle-
ment, the university "denies the 
allegations" contained in 
Martinez's lawsuit. 

If he wants to receive his degree 
from the University of Colorado, 
Martinez has until Aug. 1 to finish 
rwo courses - a philosophy course 
and his foreign language require-
ment. The courses must be com-
pleted off-campus and approved by 
the universi ty. 

Bobbi Barrow, a spokeswoman 
for the university, would only say 
that "we' re glad that this case has 
reached a conclusion." 

He added that an overzealous 
university unwilling to listen to his 
side of the story marred his reputa-
tion. 

"It foll ows you around ," 
Martinez said. "You tell people 
you were expelled, but a judge 
threw it out of court. People stop 
listening after you say 'but.' It's 
like 0.]. saying, ' I was arrested for 
murder, but I was acquitted .' 
Nobody will listen. It will take 
years before this isn't important 
to me."

Stanford to review its grading 
. policy to check for inflation 
University follows Harvard's lead 

(U-WlRE) STANFORD, Calif. 
- At a closed meeting last week, 
the faculty at Harvard University 
voted in favor of two sweeping 
changes regarding its grading sys-
tCln. Harvard will switch from a 
non-traditional 15 -point grading 
scale to the more conventional 
scale - one in which a 4.0 is an A 
and a zero is an F - and also will 
limit the number of students 
allowed to graduate with honors to 
60 percent of a class, the New York 
7imts reported recently. 

These changes come after a 
committee of the Faculty of Arts 
and Sciences at Harvard decided -
following a yearlong debate - that 
grade inflation exists at Harvard 
and that it fails to distinguish the 
truly exceptional students from 
those who are JUSt "very good." 

For some time, Harvard has 
received criticism that too many of 
its students were receiving Ns and 
graduating with honors. In last years 
graduating class at Harvard, nearly 
90 percent of the students graduated 
with some form of honors. 

Harvard's decisive action on the 
topic has raised speculation that 
other colleges and universities may 
soon follow suit. 

Rally: 
University has offered a 
new contract 
Continued from pap I 

and accused the university of filvor-
ing research over teaching. 

After Michaelis presented her 
experience, several representatives 
from other unions spoke ·out in 
support of the American 
Federation of Teachers, the union 

"What Harvard does is impor-
tant because of its history and role in 
American higher education," said 
Stanford University Registrar Roger ' 
Printup. "I am sure that its action in 
this matter will spur discussion 
around the country on the meaning 
of grades, grading standards and 
related issues. I am also sure, howev-
er, that the responses of other uni-
versities will vary depending on their 
own histories, practices and values." 

At Stanford, the Faculty Senate 
is currently reviewing the 
Universitys grading procedures. 

The Committee on Academic 
Appraisal and Achievement, which 
reports to the senate, was asked by 
the Steering Committee of the sen-
ate to look into issues of grading 
and grade inflation this year, 
according to Senate Chair John 
Riclcford, a professor of linguistics. 

"Appraising and responding to 
student work is of course an 
important part of a university edu-
cation and grades are just one ele-
me11l of it," Riclcford said. 

Greater issues than grades and 
percentages, such as "the substan-
tive commentary and feedback fac-
ul ty should provide [to students l, 
or the way our teaching should be 

representation the lecrurers, and its 
demands on the university. 

At the rally, Carolan 
Buckmaster, the president of the 
Union of Professional and 
Technical Employees, and Mark 
Warshaw, an eighth-year graduate 
student and AFT member, both 
pledged the support of their unions 
in working together for a better 
contract. 

Michael Melman, director of 
labor relations at UCSD, rejected 
the lecturers' claims that the uni-

shaped and informed by the evi-
dence of learning evaluation pro-
vides throughout a course" are 
involved in current discussions, 
according to RicHord. 

The Committee on Academic 
Appraisal and Achievement is 
expected to present an information 
report at the next Steering 
Committee meeting June 4. 

"Whether and to what extent 
grade inflation exists for Stanford 
undergraduates probably deserves 
study," said Hank Greely, vice chair 
of the senate and professor of law. 
"Just labeling something 'grade 
inflation,' though, doesn 't necessar-
ily mean that is a problem that 
needs to be solved. 

"If the average undergraduate 
GPA had climbed, to use a hypo-
thetical example, from 3.2 to 3.3 
over the past 40 years, that might 
be grade inflation, but it probably 
wouldn 't be worth worrying 
about. If, on the other hand -
equally hypothetically - the aver-
age GPA had climbed from 3.2 to 
3.7 over the last 10 years, that 
would seem clearly to deserve 
some attention." 

- Cynthia Cho 
The Stllnford Daily (Stllnford U) 

versity has been unfair. 
"The university has made a 

comprehensive proposal," he said. 
"We've made good-faith negotia-
tions." 

The university is working on a 
proposal that would provide merit 
increases and job security that 
would elevate the status oflecturers 
after they work for six years. That 
proposal would allow for three-
year contracts, possibly replacing 
quarter-by-quarter contracts for 
lecturers, Melman said,

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Davis: 
Governor praised UCSD 
engineering's excellence 
Continued from page 1 
American city in which to do busi-
ness, with the most diversified 
economy. 

"Out of 10 cities on chosen, six 
were in California," Davis said. 

While acknowledging Silicon 
Valley's leading role in California's 
economy, Davis briefly alluded to a 
more diversified plan for the future. 

"My vision is not of one Silicon 
Valley, but many Silicon Valleys, 
each propelling scientific break-
throughs, cutting-edge jobs and cut-
ting-edge industries," Davis said . 

When Atkinson fi rst 
approached Davis with the propos-
al to expand UCSD, Davis expect-
ed two-to-one matching funds 
from the universi ty. 

"I explained [matching funds] 
would be difficult to achieve, but in 
hindsight, the governor was right," 
Atkinson said. "We achieved almost 
three-to-one matching funds, due in 
large part to money received from 
California industries." 

Irwin Jacobs explained how he 
and his company became involved 
with UCSD's expansion. 

" Aher hearing the need for two-
to-one matching funds, we dis-
cussed it at Qualcomm and decided 
to give a gift ofSI5 million to Cal-
<rD2 to bridge the digital divide," 
Irwin Jacobs said. 

Irwin Jacobs demonstrated a 
new cellular phone during his 
speech, using it to take a digital 
photo of the audience. 

"I can't possibly give a talk with-
out showing off at least one 
device," he said. 

Sixteen-year old Warren fresh-
man, Jacobs School Scholar and 
Cal-(lT)2 fellow Ezekiel Bhasker 
also mounted the podium to make 
a speech and cue the official 
groundbreaking. 

"When [came to UCSD, I did so 
because I recognized it was one of 
the finest wUversities - one of the 
finest research institutions - in the 
country," Bhasker said. "This 
groundbreaking means a lot to me 
because I'm a part of the Jacobs 
School of Engineering and Cal-
(11)2." 

MONDAY, JUNE J, 2002 

"UCSD is eighth in the nation, 
and in California, second only to 
UC Berkeley. Thi ngs happen 
faster at UCSD and they happen 
better." 

Not all attendees were pleased 
with the governor's visit and the cer-
emony, citing a lack of emphasis on 
undergraduates and a recently pro-
posed California budget that cuts 
$162 million from the University of 
California, including a $32 million 
cut to research programs. 

UCSD student David Fischer 
denounced the emphasis on gradu-
ate research and corporate inAuence. 

"[ think this is hurting us 
through undergraduate education," 
Fischer sai d. "[Cal-(IT)2] is an 
example of corporations getting 
their interests into the universities, 
trying to get us out of college and 
infO the corporate sector faster." 

Other srudents were more opti-
mistic, especially with the presence 
of Davis. 

Anna MacMurdo/Gooroon 

Meeting the future: Gov. Gray DaVIS greets Earl Warren College students at 
Fnday's ground breaking ceremony in the Jacobs School of Engineering plaza. 

The chief donor was San Diego-
based Qualcomm Corporation and 
irwin andJoanJacobs- the compa-
ny's founder and his wife. 

The interest in expanding 
UCSD instead of other schools 
arises from UCSD bei ng "arguably 
the fastest-growing research uni-
versity in the galaxy," Davis said. 

The governor continued, 

"It is great to see the governor as 
such a huge part in the expansion at 
this campus," said College 
Democrats President and Revelle 
College Senior Senator Amy 
Uyeshima. "I really feel like Gray 
Davis thinks that UCSD has the 
potential of grearnes.~ . His visit to our 
ca mpus demonstrated his expecta-
tion of my generation and energized 
ourcamplls." 

Budget: 
Council debates usage 
of reserve funds 
Continued from page 1 
safety net, and I do not think 
they should be touched." 

Although this is the sec-
ond-consecutive year that A.S. 
has considered spending 
reserve money, Brown said it 
will not become a common 
occurrence for future councils. 

"The spending out of 
<reserves is not to set a precedent 

that we should be spending out 
of reserves. It's solely to fund at 
the basic level the things that 
the A.S. needs to be funding," 
Brown said. "1 am not a big pro-
ponent of taking money out of 
mandated reserves to supple-
ment the budget." 

Opposed to cutting funding 
when possible, other A.S. mem-
bers believe that maintaining 
funding is necessary. 

"' '''e can't just start slashing 
programs," said John Muir 
Colleg Senior Senator Corinne 
Hart. "The student body will be 
angry if we just start slashing 
things. Responsibly dipping 
into the reserves is a necessary 
evi l." 

The lack of clarity as to 
when reserve money ca n and 
cannot be used has also been an 
issue with some A.S. Council 
members. 

"1 don't particularly know 
how it works, but what I have 
seen is that we are dipping into 
it because we don't have enough 
money, because as A.S. is grow-
ing there are things we need to 
fund, and they are crucial 
things," said Eleanor Roosevelt 
College Sophomore Senator 

Desiree J abson. 
Another reason for dipping 

into mandate reserves: newly 
created major funding programs. 

Triton Tide, a school spirit 
program, became part of A.S. 
Council's internal budget for 
the first time this year, receiving 
$20,000. 

The newly passed athletic 
fee referendum aimed to 
improve the athletics program, 
but the fee will not completely 
fund programs like Triton Tide, 
which promotes athletics. 

"I think: that there is a gener-
al feel on this campus that we 
want to have more school spirit 
and that everybody is willing to 
pay the price for more school 
spirit," said Muir College 
Sophomore Senator Jeremy 
Cogan. "I think that Triton 
Tide can make that possible. 
The athletic referendum was a 
great accomplishment in ensur-
ing that our athletics remained 
here, but we sti ll need funding 
for groups that will promote the 
athletics. " 

Another major addition to 
the A.S. Council budget has 
been money for diversity affairs, 
totaling $37,500, including stu-
dent outreach programs. 

"The reason for doing that 
[funding student outreach pro-
gramsl was that this year the 
state gave a lot of money to all 
the UC campuses for student-
initiated outreach, and they cut 
all student-initiated outreach in 
the budget [for this yearl, and as 
an A.S. we wanted ro show to 
the state that student-initiated 
outreach is a priority to stu-
dents," Brown said. 

Members of council worked 
on the budget Sunday night and 
will debate it further at 
Wednesday's weekly meeting.

Art and politics combined May 
31 as the ProAmerica exhibition 
took over the Price Center ga lleries. 

Although the event w~s titled 
ProAmerica, it was not necessarily 
pro-government in that it offered 
varying viewpoints. Some of the art 
howed support for the present 

U.S. role as a world power, while 
other pieces questioned recent for-
eign and domestic affairs. 

The art covered different 
aspects of America in several medi-
ums. Photographs, paintings and 
poetry covered the walls, while two 
videos played on opposite ends of 
the gallery. One video questioned 
the nation's response to Sept. II 
and its sudden acceptance of 
President George W. Bush, while 
the other showed skewed close-up 
images of fireworks while the 
recording of a New Year's Eve news 
report played in the background. 

"One of the problems that I see 
is that a lot of different people feel 
a lot of di fferent things, but they're 
not talking to each other," said 
event organizer and visual arts stu-
dent Dawn Chenette. 

"Even though this show d.oes 
have a slant of sarcasm to it, it's real-
ly about asking questions and about 
aski ng what freedom really is." 

Chenette, along with fellow 
visual art student Kim Daniels, put 
on the show to create a space in 
which various artists could present 
their work dealing with a post-
Sept. II America, she said. 

One of the works displayed was 
a series of three black-and-white 
photos of color-enhanced 7-Eleven 
Slurpies in cups reading "United 
We Stand," with one word adorn-
ing each photo. 

A more somber photomural 
showed images of a strugglin g 
human figure bound up entirely in 
cloth. 

The show's theme was chosen in 
response to the ProAmerica 
Coalition, a group which formed 
on campus after the Sept. II 
attacks, Daniels said. 

Isaac SuIlivan/Gumdian 

Art Ameriu: Tow students enjoy the ProAmerica art show, which displayed art 
of various mediums and political viewpoints on May 31 in the Price Center. 

"They seem to want to define 
the word 'pro-America' for all the 
students on campus as a statement 
that meant we should support our 
flag, you should support ou r presi-
dent, you shouldn't question why 
the world hates us or why certain 
groups are upset with the United 
States," Daniels said. 

Despite the controversial works 
at the exhibit, the atmosphere at the 
ProAmerica exhibit was casual. A DJ 
played upbeat music, a buffet offered 

wine and refreshments, and festive 
red, white and blue crepe paper hung 
around the room. About 25 students 
milled around the room and there 
was much corning and going. 

The overall goal of the evening 
was a positive one, Chenette 
explained. 

"Every artist here believes 
something different, so to me it's 
kind of like what America is," 
Chenette said. "We don't all have 
the same opinion."

Road of experience, cockiness leads to the top 
New chief says hello to readers, farewell to exiting editors 
By JOSH CROUSE 
News Editor 

Three and a half weeks ago, I was 
elected next years editor in chief of 
the Guardian. As one of my "duties," 
I was supposed to write the last edi-
tor's soapbox of the year. I knew it 
was coming. I knew what I wanted to 
write about ... basically. 

Believe me, this is harder than it 
looks. But as one of myoid editor 
used to tell me, when you can't think 
of anything to say, JUSt start writing. 
If that nlrns out to be a worthless 
pile of shit, then start writing with 
someone elses words. It was some-
thing to that effect, anyway. 

Since everything that I've tried 
to say in my own words has been 
worthless, I'll just start with an old 
quote from Jerry Garcia. 

"\,\;nat a long, strange trip it's 
been." 

For me, the trip began five years 
ago - almost to the day - when I 
was a broke-ass high school sopho-
more looking to put some coin in 
his pocket for the summer. As I 
perused the want ads, I came across 
a listing for a sports writer for the 
local paper, a small rag with a cir-
culation of about 30,000.1 figured 
that writing sportS would be a lot 
better than flipping burgers and 
cl eaning toilet bowls all summer, so 
I applied for the job. 

I ended up writing at that paper 
for the rest of my high school years. 
By the time I left for college, I had 
become part of the T1I1'Iock JOIln1al 
family. I still went back to write for 
the paper during summer and win-
ter breaks, but the personnel 

changed a little bit each time I 
came back, until finally I hardly 
knew anyone there. The feeling of 
family had deteriorated. 

Enter the G'UlJrdia7l. 
I sti ll remember the first time I 

walked into the Guardian office. I 
was the cockiest bastard to ever 
stroll through that door for the first 
time. One hand carried a binder 
full of three years' worth of article 
clippings. The other hand was sup-
porting my elephant-sized head, 
swollen with an inflated ego. 

The ego was only stroked when 
then-editor in chief Marc Comer 
bypassed the application process and 
took me straight back to meet the 
editors. One of the first editors that 
I met that day was Jessica 
cheppmann, the resident features 

femi-nazi . She hired me on the spot 
as her editorial assistant (read: 
"bitch") and informed me that I 
would be in charge of production 
that weekend since she would be at a 
wedding and the associate editor 
was having her wisdom teeth pulled. 

After survi,~ng the initial shock 
of Gll1lrdian production, I settled 
nicely into the features section. ] 
moved up through the ranks to asso-
ciate features editor and then fea-
tures editor. This year J have tackled 
both the sports and news sections. 

Ever since I started at the 
Guardilln, I've had my eye on the edi-
tor in chief position. It all came down 
to three and a half weeks ago when I 
applied for the top spot. I had never 
been as nervous as I was during the 
editor in chief interviews. When I 
got the job, I nearly cried. I t was one 
of the best feelings of my life. 

Now I am looking forward to 
next year. I see nothing but great 
things in the Guardian's future . 
While there are many amazing peo-
ple graduating, we do have really tal-
ented people returning to staff. 

To those that are leaving us, I 
would like to thank you for not 
only teaching me a lot about jour-
nalism, but also for making this a 
great place to work. 

Alison Norris, one of our outgo-
ing editors in chief, has had a big 
impact on my life journalistically 
and personally. When apprQached 
with a problem, she always seemed 
to either know the answer or know 

Now I am looking 
forward to next year. I 
see nothing but great 

things in the 
Guardian's future. 

exactly where to find it. She is 
extremely dependable and she was 
one of the people that convinced 
me to come back to the Guardian 
this year. She's a great person who 
will be missed at the Guardia7l. 

Jeff Wh.ite, the other outgoing 
chief, is someone who I will really 
miss having around the office next 
year. More than his knowledge of 
journalism, which is quite large, he 
was always a calming presence in 
the office. He is a guy who could 
always make you laugh, bllt was a 
go-to guy in the clutch. 

Geoff Dietrich, my co-editor in 
the news section for most of the 

year, is also leaving us for greener 
pastures. His ability to search out 
stories, see all the angles and deal 
with writers made my life a whole 
lot easier this year. 

T he opinion duo of Divya 
Runchal and Jennifer Sposito will 
also be missed in next year 's editorial 
ranks. The two were very depend-
able and great to have around the 
office. They are two of the nicest, 
sweetest gals I've ever met and it will 
be rough losing a pair like that. 

Isaac Pearlman will be taking 
next year off from the editorial 
ranks of the Guardial/. Isaac has put 
in countless hours the past two 
years in the sports section. He is 
extremely dependable and always 
has things together. 

Similarly, I will miss outgoing 
associate sports editor Tait Miller. 
Always the laid-back guy, Tait was a 
pleasure to have around the office 
and chat with when things got 
stressful. However, when the going 
got tough in sports, he was always 
ready to get it back on track. 

The hiatus section certainly 
won't be the same next year with-
out the presence of Joseph Lee, a 
hiatus staple for the past two years. 
While his style kept a lot of us on 
our toes during production days 
and Monday meetings, Joe always 
came through with a high-quality 
product that made us proud to have 
him on staff. 

Features will lose a solid journal-
ist in Malavika Gangolly, who got 
her start working with me in the fea-
tures section. She was always some-
one I could count on. We'll miss her. 

The photo department will be 

MONDAY, JUNE 3, 2002 

without the leadership of Lyon 
Liew, who, in his short stay at the 
Guardian, has made photo into our 
most dependable section week in 
and week out. 

The copy department is losing 
Andrew Quadri, a guy who was 
extremely dedicated to his job ami 
never shied away from the extra 
work needed to make his section a 
little better, and Maryam 
Banihashemi, who will take a quar-
ter off from the Guardian before 
hopefully returning to us as a copy 
reader. 

Design will be without it's two 
leaders from this year, Laura 
Brown and Ed Wu. The two of 
them have expertly guided the 
design of the paper through the 
good and the bad. The two of them 
have put in as many hours in the 
office as almost anyone else on 
staff, save our beloved departing 
chiefs. They will be hard to replace 
in next year's staff. 

While we are losing all of these 
great people, I am confident that 
we can continue to provide UCSD 
with a place to nlrn to for news, 
sports, opinions, features, arts and 
entertainment. As Ben Parker said 
in Spider-Man, "With great power 
comes great responsibility." We at 
the GlIlJrdian take that power and 
responsibility seriously. If any of 
you ever feel that we are not doing 
our part to provide high-quality 
journalism every Monday and 
Thursday, please e-mail me at tdi-
tor@lIcsdgllllrdian.o1g. 

Until next year, keep reading the 
GlIlJrdian, have a beer, have sex and, 
for Christ's sake, have some fun.

When school finally lets out in June, reading for pleasure is in 
Best book bets for summer: romance, comedy, beat philosphy and lots of sex 
By UNDSAY BOYD 
Associate Features Editor 

Ocean breezes, cold beer, suntans, romance~ 
and great books - ahhh, the many wonderful 
things about summer. But what makes a good 
summer book) It can't be toO serious; it can't 
require much thinking and it can't be too 
important because Lord knows when you have a 
book in one hand and a beer in the other, you 
may not remember the whole thing. Like all 
things in summer. your reading list should be 
fun. 

"Namedropper," by Emma Forrest, is defi-
nitely a great summer book. One of the most 
underrated books of the last five years, 
"Namedropper" will have YOll laughing out loud . 
The novel's heroine, Viva Cohen, is a precociou 
London teenager who lives with her gay uncle 
and is best friends with, as Simon and Schuster 
puts it, "3 drugged-out beauty queen and an 
aging rock star." The book follows Viva from 
London to Los Angeles, where she rubs elbows 
with celebritie , gets tattooed and loses her vir-
ginity. 

You may think this sounds like a bit of a 
"chick book," but Forrest writes so well that 
Viva's antics will make even the most macho of 
guys laugh harder than they have ever laughed 
while reading. Forrest's "Namedropper" is a 
great feminine counterpart to Nick Hornby's 
" lIigh Fideliry." 

Speaking of Hornby, his follow up to "High 
Fidelity" has recently been made into a movie . 
"About a Boy," which stars Hugh Grant and 
l o ni Collett on the big screen, shows how Will 
Freeman's bachelor lifestyle is changed after 
befriending a boy. While the movie is excel-
lent, the book is a lot better. Hornby has a bril-
liant way of weaving rock 'n' roll into plot 
lines. 

"High Fidelity" was a bible for vinyl-loving 
bachelors everywhere, and "About a Boy" uses 
music in much the same way. While Nirvana 
plays a key role in the book, the movie changed 
the grunge rock theme to hip-hop. This was an 
obvious move to appeal to a more modern and 
diverse audience (since when did liking Nirvana 

make you dated?). Nirvana was one of those 
important literary devices that meant so much to 
the book; the title itself is a play on the Nirvana 
song "About a Girl." If you haven't seen the 
movie yet, go see it, but read the book also -
you'll thank me later. 

If witty British novels aren't your thtng, per-
haps you should round up your best buds and 
head out in search of new adventures - or just 
read Jack Kerouac's classic, "On the Road ." Sal 
Paradise, Dean Moriarty, Carlo Marx, Mary Lou 
and Old Bull Lee are just some of the friends 
you'll meet in this ode to the ' freedom of the 
open road. Hopefully, this book that came to 
define the Beat generation was not ruined by 
your high school literature class; it is one of 
those great novels that reaffirms the importance 
of finding. 

The moral of "On the Road" is that in life, 
what is important is not the destination. but the 
journey and the friends and experiences you pick 
up along the way. Read it in June, then hitchhike 
across the country in July. Just make sure you 
send a postcard to your mom so she doesn't 
worry. 

All that is left is the important and always 
entertaining trash novel genre. Any supermar-
ket romance novel will do, but if you're going 
to read trash, read the best trash that money 
can buy. Of course] mean Jacqueline Susanne's 
"Valley of the Dolls," the mother of all trash 
literature (and J mean that as a huge compli-
ment). 

In "Valley of the Dolls," you will enter the 
world of Neely, Jennifer and Anne. The things 
that unite these three women are dolls - red 
dolls, pink dolls and yellow dolls . These dolls are 
pill s: Nembutals, Valium, Dexedrine and any 
other 1960s upper or downer. Sex scenes, plot 
twists, overdoses and cheating husbands are wha t 
make "Valley of the Dolls" a living, breathing, 
shouting, screaming text that was one of the 
most sca ndal ous book to hi t bookstores in the 
1960s. 

So there you have it: four books that never 
won the Pulitzer Prize or the National Book 
Award, but have enough sex, drugs and rock 'n' 
roll to be thoroughly entertaining.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Chips: 
Dreilinger walked into 
sticky situation at Muir 
Continued from page 11 
the walls and paintings," 
Dreilinger said. 

He seems amused by it now, but 
said he was very annoyed at the 
time. 

Mahaffey said that Dreilinger's 
job was difficult and frustrating at 
times because he had to report to 
the provost and to the vice chan-
cellor of student affairs; being the 
mediator at times was another 
great challenge. 

Dreilinger has met and worked 
with all kinds of people and han-
dled many different situations. He 
says that he tries "not to be very 
judgmental with anyone." 

"I have to do a lot of discipline, 
which 1 really dislike," Dreilinger 
said. "One problem was the stu-
dents who had blatantly violated 
rules and regulations but still 
refused to admit to it or even talk 
about it ." 

Yet Mahaffey said Dreilinger "is 
great with discipline." One positive 
contribution she mentioned was 
his rewriting of "convoluted" stu-
dent rules into "student-friendly 
terms." 

When Dreilinger arrived at 
UCSD, he was handed a IO-year 
study of Muir students that con-
cluded that only 40 percent of 
Muir students were staying in 
school, while the other 60 per-
cent were dropping out. He 
explained that one of the main 
reasons behind such an attrition 
rate was the "alienation" that stu-
dents felt. 

That study really' made 
Dreilinger more determined to 
"enrich student life" and develop a 
community in which students feel 
they belong. He admits that it is 
hard to reach everyone, like many 
of the transfer students, for exam-
ple . 

"When I first came to Muir, 
there were only six organizations, 
including the council and the com-
muters," Dreilinger sa id. "Now 
there are 36. I never rejected a pro-

posa! for an organization. We have 
everything from Muir Bowling to 
Muir Tv, and even S.T.I.T.C.H. 
[Students Taking Initiative to 
Crochet Hats] for students who like 
to knit." 

Dreilinger doesn 't just advocate 
passionate student involvement -
he leads by example. 

As dean, Dreilinger attended 
every single Muir event and even 
various Muir organizations meet-
ings. He would stay at the MCC 
meetings until I a.m. if he had to. 

Mahaffey said he "always 
stood Ollt at the Un-Olympics" 
because it is his favori te event of 
the year. 

A perfect example is the year 
that the movie "Braveheart" came 
out; for the Muir entrance at the 
Un-Olympics, he and the students 
ran on to the field wearing kilts and 
face paint. 

'Colleges are losing 
their purpose as the 
campus is becoming 

more significant, 
more united. It is the 

UCLA-ization of 
UCSD: 

- Chlrles 'Chlps' Drelllnqer 
Dean of John Muir College 

"I always took part in our excit-
ing entrances," Dreilinger said, 
laughing. 

One year, a student wrote a play 
titled "Who Killed John Muir?" 
and Dreilinger played John Muir 
because he strongly resembles the 
famous ecologist. Mahaffey 
recounted how he had to walk face 
first into a cake three nights In a 
row: "You won't find many deans 
who wi!! do that!" 

Dreilinger starts reaching out 
to students early, according to 
Mahaffey. Every year at freshman 
orientation, he illustrates his wel-
coming speech with costumes. 

"If he was going to talk about 
student parking, then he would 
wear a police hat," Mahaffey said. 
"If he was goi ng to talk about the 
cafeteria, he would wear a chef's 

MONDAY, JUNE 3, 2002 

hat." 
Dreilinger is known for sup-

porting student cause, sometimes 
in the face of opposition from 
other administrators. 

Batniji said that Dreilinger ha s 
never stopped working and light-
ing for the snldents. 

"He supported us in everything 
we wanted to do," she said. 

Batniji gave the example of the 
annual Muirstock this year, when 
Muir was denied the beer garden 
they had requested. 

"I know that deep down, Chips 
did not like the idea, but he really 
supported us and fought for us," 
she said. "He got up on stage that 
night and asked 'Where's the beer 
garden?' and everyone was just 
laughing and cheering." 

He said that it is so rewarding 
when he would see student faces 
light up. With a wide grin, he 
said, "I would see the light bulb 
go on." 

Dreilinger is also frank about 
his opposition to UCSD's continu-
al expansion. 

"Colleges are losing their pur-
pose as the campus is becoming 
more significant, more unified," he 
said. "It is the UCLA-ization of 
UCSD." 

He brushed these thoughts 
aside as he said, "things just 
change," and that the campus 
evolves into what the students 
want, which is important in his 
eyes. 

"There has been phenomenal 
growth and change at UCSD," 
Dreilinger said, adding that a lot 
of the change is in the students 
from generation to generation . 
"They have become more family-
oriented now. Before, students did 
not want to be seen with their par-
ents," 

Dreil inger decided in 
November 2001 that he would 
resign at the end of the school year, 
a decision he made in conjunction 
with his wife. He said his family has 
been very supportive of the deci-
sion. 

Medical reasons are responsible 
for his slowdown, he said, and this 
year he was only on campus two

" If I was healthy, I would not 
leave," Dreilinger said. "But stay-
ing and working and doing a half-
ass job is not something I feel good 
about." 

He said he has very "mixed feel-
ings" about retiring. 

"I am curious about it," he said 
after a deep breath. "I want to get a 
dog. 1 need to have some company 
after being surrounded by students . 
all the time." 

He is looking forward to having 
more "leisure time" for reading. 

"' love to read anything, you 
name it," he said. "From trash, to 
cl assic novels, to botany." 

I n fact, . one of Dreil j nger 's 
favorite pastimes is gardening and 
he is excited to devote more time to 
it now. He has 800 cacti and succu-
lents. 

"I love my plants," he said. "I 
used to just be amazed with watch-
ing a plant grow from a seed that I 
planted." 

Dreilinger's sons live in the Bay 
Area and Dreilinger plans to travel 
to see them and his grandchildren 
more often. He does not feel tied 
down to San Diego and he may 
move elsewhere. 

"[San Diego] is no longer as 
enjoyable as before," Dreilinger 
said. "It has grown so much, just 
like UCSD." 

Despite the new opportunities 
retirement gives to him, Dreilinger 
said he is going to miss the students 
the most. 

"They really keep me ener-
gized," he said . 

This year will be his last gradu-
ation after 23 years, and he will 
read the names of the graduating 
class. 

"It is funny because I used to 
think of graduation as a joke, but I 
see how important it is to students 
here," he said. "It all seems so spe-
cial. I am looking forward to it." 

He said that he has had the priv-
ilege of working with a "great 
staff," one being Mahaffey, who 
will be Muir's new dean next year. 
She laughed as she said that she has 
"big nip-nops to fill" because 
Dreilinger will leave behind "many 
empty pockets ." 

Batniji smiled and said, "J love 
Chips - he will definitely be 
missed."

CYCLING 

UCSD cycling came into this 
season hoping to rebuild after los-
ing many experienced riders from 
1m year's squad. Despite being 
forced to \ISCI several first-year rid-
ers, UCSD made this season suc-
cessful both in rebuilding and flIC-
lng. . 

The team got off to the righr 
$Wt. winning bQth of its home 
races and ~ sec;ond in both of 
San Diego State University's races. 
UCSD enjoyed 11 outright vicro-
ries at these races early in the sea-
son. 

However, u the year contin-
ued, UCSD saw the competition 
grow t'Ol.Igber as the team fell out 
of the first-place position it had 
earned duri!l8' the $WOn's first 
two weeks. UCSD took: fifth aDd 
sixth place in two races hosted by 
Cal Pqly San Luis Obispo, respec-
dvely, second place during a week-
end at UCLA, and fourth place in 
11 trjp to UC Berkeley. 

When regionals rolled around, 
UCSD stoOd in fifth place. Matt 
Sadauckas established himself as 
the le3der of the cycling te2lJl, 
wi th rookie Geoff Rapoport NC-
ing along side him in Cat A. On 
the women~ side, tri-athleu: 
Esther Mcrki and rooJcies Ra.rnlah 
Nehring and Megan Wemmer 
represented UCSD in Cae A. 

lJCSD too/doorm pbce in the 
road race and in criterium at the 
regionals. 

fnclividuaUy, Sadauckas was 
forced to complete th.e Illen's A 
criterium race on a repbcement" 
bike after wrecking his ,main bike. 
He maNged to taIce third pbce. 
Rapoport finished in $ixfh pbce. 

The women's A criterium 
proved to be competitive, 1lnd 
Nehring placed nimh. Merki and 
Wemmer were closely behind 
Nehring and took 11 th and J 4 th 
place. respectiveJy. 

On the second d:lY of regionals. 
Slidauckas gat" off to a quick Start 
in the road I'lICC and was riding 
alone off the front of the main 
field. Impressive ly, Rapo port 
caught' up to Sadauckas 2nd the 
two crossed the finish line toge th -
er in tint pbce: Foi the women, 
Nehring, Merlri and Wemmer fin -
ished eighth, 11th and 13 th, 
respectively. in their t03d race. 

Despite being able to take a 
complete t\:alll to nttion3ls, four 
individuals qualified on individoal 
merit: Sadauckas, Rapoport. 
Nehring and Resor, who proved to 
be the women~ top Cat A racer 
during the reguJar season but 
missed the regionals due to other 
responsibilities. 

Although the four UCSD ath-
letes were unable to eaTn point'S in 
the team-rime-nial eve.nt~ they 
managed a 12th place finish ODt of 
the 55 competing teams. 
Sadauckas e1l,1'ned sixth place in the 
criterium, second in the road race, 
and he beeame the third-pl3ee col-
legiate rider in the nation, earning 
AlI-Amerita status. 

The team is losing several rid-
ers thl, year, including Sadauckas 
and Merki. UCSD is hoping a 
sttong returning core and COID-
mitted ridefS in the lower cate-
gories will ca.ntribute to a solid 
team next year and a return trip to 
the nationals.

Tritons lose experience and talent in seven graduating athletes 
Women's soccer will miss members of three national championship teams 
BY BRYCE WARWICK 
Staff Writer 

A cl ass o f seni ors that has been 
together through three national 
championship victories, a move 
up to Division II and the rewrit-
ing of the National Collegiate 
Athletic Association ' record books 
will graduate fr om the UC SD 
women's soccer program thi s 
year. 

Seniors Laura Dooly, Jessica 
Cordova, Eli zabeth Hughes, Jul ia 
Cuder, Kara Morris and Nikki 
Richards won their fi rst national 
champi o nshi p as sophomores 
when Al fredson scored the lone 
goals in 1-0 national semi- final 
and fin al victories. After tasti ng 
triumph , the Triton seniors hun-
gered fo r more, and even a move 
from Division III to Division II 
thei r junior year couldn't slow this 
group down. In 2000, UCSD 
made history with a dramatic 2- 1 
victory in the national champi -
onship game againsl orthern 
Kentucky University, becoming 
the first team in NCAA history to 

win a championship the year after 
moving up a division. 

This season, the Tritons once 
again brought home a national 
title, this time toppling Christian 
Brothers University, the most pro-
lific scoring team in NCAA history, 
2 -0 in stunning fashion. 

"Last year, it was a big achieve-
ment coming up to Division II and 
winning,M said head coach Brian 
McManus. "Last year was a big 
surprise, but this year everyone was 
coming after us." 

However, no matter how many 
times they Icept coming, the Triton 
defense turned them away, led by 
2001 California Collegiate Athletic 
Association MVP Cuder. 

After watching her anchor a 
defense that surrendered only ten 
goals last season, McManus speaks 
highly of Cuder. 

"She's a Division I player," he 
said. "Mast of our seniors are." 

To prove McMan us' point, 
C ordova turned in perhaps the 
most incred ible individual match 
in UCSD hi story in the 200 1 
c hampionship game. Co rdova was 

asked to rna ric Missy Gregg, a 
Division I Pre-Season AII -
American who came to Division II 
and annihilated the opposition, 
averaging 3.5 goals per game and 
scoring more goals in tatal than 
the entire Triton team. Accolades 

'We never set ourselves 
targets until the end. 
Every year, we're the 
bottom rung and we 
just want to see how 
many rungs we can 

climb until the season 
finishes: 

- Brian McManus 
UCSD women 's soccer head coach 

as ide, when the defi ning game 
came, Cordova marked Gregg out 
of the match and paved the way 
fo r a T ri ton victory. 

Without goals, however, there 

can be no victory, and the always. 
steady Hughes scored the biggest 
of her nine UCSD goals in the final 
match of her ca reer. Adding 14 
assists a ver her four years, she 
helped solidi fy a strong Triton 
midfield. 

A fellow G unn High School 
graduate, Al fr edson was the 
recipient of many feeds from that 
midfield, and when she received 
the ball , she knew what to do 
with it. Tallying 38 goals over 
fo ur years, Al fredso n led the 
team in scoring both her jun ior 
and seni or years. 

From her o u ts ide midfield 
spOt, Dooly provided plenty of 
offense, also scoring 28 goals in 
her stra ng career. With a pen-
chant fo r explosive pl ay, Dooly 
ke pt defenses off balance and gave 
UCSD a strong o ption out on the 
wi ng. 

Interestingly, the senior that 
defines thi s class in McManus' 
mind is not one of the obvious 
stars, but rather the unsung hero-
ine, Richards. 

"She didn 't start some games, 

didn't playa lot, but she was always 
there at practice, never moaned or 
complained and had a fanta stic atti-
rude," McManus said. "You 've got 
to have a lot of respect for some-
body like that." • 

C losing out the UCSD senior 
class is Morris, a defender who saw 
her playing time limited during her 
senior season but who was one of 
only three Tritons to stan every 
game her junior ycar. She is part of 
an incredi ble and elite group th at 
can boast three national champi· 
ons!' i p ~ings . . 

We ve always gone ,nto sea-
sons just to see how well we ca n 
do," McManus said . "We never se t 
ourselves targets until the end. 
Every year, we're the bottom rung 
and we just want to see how many 
rungs we can climb until the season 
fini shes." 

H aving climbed to the vcry tOP 
and admired the view three times, 
Triton seniors D o ol y, Cordova, 
Hughes, C uder, Al fredson and 
Morris will now move on 10 life 
beyond UCS D and will hope 10 
enjoy tI, e ame view.

Stoner: 
Wrapping up a colum-
nists' year of writing 
Continued from page 20 
can't please everybody. No matter 
how many hours you spend 
attending games, interviewing 
players, checking fa cts, writing, 
doing layouts and proofreading, 
there will always be someone 
complaining. 

The sports section is too small. 
There should be more club sports. 
The content should be limited to 
UCSD sports. The section is too 
big. There should be less club 
sports. The date in one of the arti-
cles was wrong. You should mow 
the name of one of the over 1.000 
UCSD athletes in that photo. The 
name of one of the over 1,000 
UCSD athletes is spelled wrong. 
The list could probably fill this 
issue's whole sports section by 
itself. 

The past year I have had to 
swallow all these criticisms and 
more, and take them with a grain 
of salt. More often than not, 
though, it felt as if that grain of 
salt was being rubbed into an 
open wound, as complaint after 
complaint piled up on a sports 
section I worked long hours on 
for very little pay. 

This past year I have listened 
to these complaints, some said 
directly to my face (and to those 
who did, thanlc you for your direct 

honesty), and many said behi nd 
my back - and I have done my 
best to keep from responding per-
sonally. 

It 's been hard . Earlie r thi s 
year, an a thlete accosted me at a 
party and cussed me out in front 
of my friends and a bunch of 
complete strangers. Some stare at 
me with tactile hostility as I walk 
around campus. Eve n acquain-
tances from high school ride me 
about the content of the sports 
section. 

But it's not the job of the jour. 
nalist to respond. The job of the 
journalist is just to report, to pro-
duce in the face of a critical audi-
ence of thousands of people. For 
those writers out there, imagine 
how uncomfortable you are to 
show your writing to friends or to 
family. Well, multiply that by 
11,000 and you'll understand how I 
feel when I put my columns into 
the paper. 

The life of a journalist is a lone-
ly and unappreciated one, indeed. 
Fans and readers can visually see 
how hard it is for athletes on the 
field or court - they intuitively 
/muw how hard it is to playa sport, 
either from personal experience or 
from watching it live or on televi-
sion. 

But no one sees how hard it is to 
be on this side of the sport. You 
don 't see 1V shows on ESPN doc-
umenting the challenges a journal-
ist faces. There is no one to see the 
long hours in the office, the 
headaches on production day, or 

the headaches of a carefull y 
pl anned section gone awry. All that 
is seen is the result. 

Being tile dedicated sports jour-
nalist that I am (or at least, that I 
like to call myself), let 's relate it to 
sports. 

It's analogous to a game score. 
The game score of, say, a basketball 
game, could be 96·95. However, 

This year as sports 
editor, I have spent 

over 850 hours in the 
Guardian office, and 

the one thing I've 
learned in those 850 

hours is that no 
matter what you say, 

you can't please 
everybody. 

this says nothing about the actual 
game. The score could have been 
close all game, or the losing team 
could have been down 50·0 and 
made a furious charge to come back 
and almost win. 

Well , I am the team that's down 
50-0. When I get into the office, 
there is all that blank space grin-
ning at me, mocking me with its 
emptiness. Then there is a race 
against the clock to fill it with as 
much high-quality content as ] can 
before the deadline. 

If this column seems a little 
whiny - a little defensive - you 're 
goddamn right it is. While my 
fr iends cavort and party and study 
hard and get good grades and play 
sports and sleep and enjoy them -
selvcs, I stare longir.gly at them o ut 
the window as I churn out another 
crappily written, last-minute col-
umn. 

During game seven of perhaps 
the greatest World Series ever, I 
was locked in the office doing 
production. During one of the 
most exciting Super Bowl 's in the 
last 10 years, r was chained to m y 
computer, tryi ng to write articles. 
Today, during gam e seven of one 
of the greates t NBA Western 
Conference Finals, I am once 
again stuck in the office, doing 
production. 

It seems as if even Gaeia is in on 
it, too. This quarter I have discov-
ered this immutable law of nature, 
one that has been true without fail , 
a cause-and-effect as tested and 
true as gravity: ifit is a production 
day when I have to be in the office 
all day, rhrn it will be a beautiful day 
outside. 

Last weekend as I headed, 
grumbling, to the office earl y 
Sunday morning, my girlfri end 
tried to cheer me up wi th the 
observa tion that at least it was 
overcast and not a nice day. 

"J ust wait, it wi ll be," I said, 
secure in the inevitability of my 
law. Sure enough, a few hours 
late r, the sun 's rays taunted me 
th rough my window and tempted

me wilh promises of relaxi ng al 
the beach, or jogging through the 
woods, or shooting hoops out-
side. 

But I d igress. I suppose it 
wouldn 't be a true " Stoner, Steps" 
if I didn 't wander off track at least 
once. T here have been positives 
as well , the largest by far being 
the other great people I've had to 
work wi th o n the Guu7'dio71 staff. 
Ta it, you have bee n a source of 
help and humor t hese last rwo 
quarters. Anu, you've learned the 
ropes quickly, and are more than 
capable of taking over the rei ns. 
Al l my spo rts wri ters : Thank you. 
You guys have no idea how mnch 
you 've helped me th is year. Josh 
does; he remembers the begin-
ning o f the year wh en we both 
wrote everything in the sports sec-
tion. At times YOll guys have given 
me headaches, but in all I could 
not ask for a better group of writ-
ers. 

And to all those readers and 
even fa ns out there, if they exist: I 
wish 1 could have heard from you 
more. I wish [ could have gotten 
the sense that people actuall y read 
the stuff I worked o n for 850 
hours this year. I wish I could have 
looked forward to coming into the 
office; you guys cou ld have made 
that possible. But thank you any-
ways for reading, because words 
without anyone to read them are 
nothing.

Triton athletes honored at annual banquet 
Memorable night marks end of a strong year for UCSD athletics 
By COREY HOLMAN 
Staff Writer 

The CSD athletic department 
honored the program's top teams 
JnL! IIl tll vlduals ,\ lav 29 at the 
annu al Athleti cs . Recogniti on 
Banquet at the San Diego Ma rriott 
LJ j olla hotel. 

T he two team awards were ~iven 
ti r~ t. T he women 's side of the fenc-
II1g squad earned the john 
,\ lcGinni Fami ly-Team G rade 
POll1t Average award with a com-

bi ned 3.4 G PA. T he Triton 
Athletes' Council then gave its TAC 
Spirit Award to the women's softball 
team. This award not only repre-
sented spirit on the fi eld, but also 
the team's efforts to bring their spir-
it to other sporting events as well . 

TAC C hair Steve M artin won 
the Husar FamilyfTriton Athletic 
Associates Award for ervice to the 
athlenc department. Besides his 
role on TAC, ,'v1 artin is also a 
three-time letter-winner in track 
and fie ld, served on the Associated 

rudents Task Force to create the 
recently passed ath letics referen-
dum, and played an important role 
in the organiza tion of Triton Tide. 

The athletic department then 
recognized julie Swail , UCSD 's 
first and only Olympian , with the 
Distingui shed Alumni-Athle te 
Award. T he award is usually given 
to older, ex-a thl etes who have 
achieved success in various areas of 
re earch and business; Swai l is the 

~I rst to receive this award fo r her 
exploits on the playi ng field . Swail 
participated in the 2000 Sydney 
Olympics a a member of the U.S. 
water polo team that brought home 
the silver medal. Swail joined the 
U.s. squad in 1994 while playing 
fo r the Triton .

Men's crew loses leadership of two rowers 
Sullivan and Witzgall take team to its first championship 
By OWEN MAIN 
Staff Writer 

UCSD men's crew made his-
tory this year by being the fi rst 
Triton crew to go to the D ivision 
II National C hampionships in 
New jersey. Two graduating 
seniors, Brian Sullivan and Tom 
Wi tzgall , were key elements in 
the men's va rsity-eight boat and 
will be missed. 

Sullivan, a four-year rower 
from Redlands, Calif., and team 
co-captain for the past two years, 
picked up crew as an alternative 
to another sport. 

" I played football in high 
school ," said the electrical engi-
neering major, who plans to grad-
uate next year. "I was on Library 
Walk where they were recruiting 
for the crew team. 1 guess the rest 
is history." 

But it wasn't as easy as Sullivan 
makes it sound. During his senior 
year of high school , the four-time 
winner of the UCSD Oarsman of 
the Year Award broke his femur 
and tore the anterior crucial liga-
ment in his knee while pl aying 
football. 

"I considered playing rugby," 
Sullivan said. "But 1 didn't want 
to tear my knee up again. I fig-

ured I could still compete with a 
team while letting my knee heal." 

Although he's been the captain 
of the varsity team for the past 
two seasons, Sullivan cites a race 
during his sophomore season as 
his favorite memory of crew. 

"We were neck-and-neck with 
Sacramento State [University]," 
Sullivan said . "They had beaten 
us earlier in the season and were 
trying to make a move on us. We 

could hear their coxswain yelling 
at them, saying 'we 're walking on 
them.' One of our rowers yelled 
back 'no you 're not!' It got every-
body together and we ended up 
beating them by a lot. 

"That's what this sport is all 
about: what you can do when 
everybody is together as a team." 

The other senior who's rowed 
his last race for UCSD is 
Witzgall. A latecomer, Witzgall

didn 't start rowing unti l his 
sophomore year after finishing a 
year of pole-vaulting on the 
Tritons' track and field team. 

"I wanted to do something 
new," Witzgall said. "I thought 
crew would be more fun ." 

Wi tzga II , from Sacramento, 
C alif. , came to UCSD for the 
beach and found his place in the 
water as the two-seat on the varsi-
ty-eight boat this season. After 
graduating with a degree in ecolo-
gy, WirzgaU plans to make a leap to 
Washington State University in 
Pullman, Wash., for graduate 
school. 

"Crew was a good experience 
for me," he said. "It's different 
from any other sport because there 
is so much emphasis put on the 
team concept. To be successful , the 
whole team has to be together. " 

Losing only two rowers to 
graduation , UCSD crew will look 
to improve on a season that saw 
high expectatio ns and a topsy-
turvy race season. 

"We had a very good novice 
team this year and, along with our 
returning varsity rowers. We 
expect have a vety strong team 
[next season)," said UCSD head 
coach Michael Filippone earlier 
in the year.
