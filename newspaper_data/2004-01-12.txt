Schwarzenegger calls for 
sweeping cuts to UC budget 

liy BRYAN TSAO 
Associate News Editor 

With California facing up to a 
$29 billion budget deficit over the 
next two years, Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger released his bud-
get proposal for the 2004-05 fiscal 
year on Jan. 9 that includes deep 
budget cuts. Schwarzenegger pro-
posed a total of over $14.3 billion 
in reductions, including $372 mil-
lion to the University of California. 

lb.e governor's proposal for the 
University of California includes 
fee increases, significant reducÂ·tions 
to financial aid, a reduction in 
enrollment for the 2004-05 school 
year, the elimination of state sup-
port for K-12 outreach programs 
and reduced spending on faculty. 

The proposal, which also 
includes cuts of $2 billion to K-12 
education and community col-
leges, $1.3 billion to local govern-
ments, $999 million to Business, 
Transportation and Housing ser-
vices and $881 million to Health 
and Human Services, must be 
approved by the state legislature. 

"The governor is making diffi-
cult choices, and asking many 
parts of state government to sacri-
fice, as the state confronts a mas-
sive budget deficit," UC President 
Robert C. Dynes stated following 

A.S. 
approves 

commuter 
charter 
By NEIL SPEARS 
Senior Staff Writer 

The A.S. Council passed the 
charter for the new All-Campus 
Commuter Board by consensus on 
Jan. 7 

According to the charter, the 
board will serve as the "representa-
tive voice of the commuter student 
body" and provide programming 
geared for the unique needs of 
commuter students. 

"It had come to my realization 
that we didn't have an all-campus 
commuter organization," A.S. 
President Jeremy Paul Gallagher 
said. "With more than half this 
school being commuter students, it 
seemed like [commuters] were at a 
loss." 

The all-campus board will serve 
as an umbrella organization for the 
smaller college-based commuter 
associations. 

"The thing in a commuter is 
that you have as much affiliation to 
your college as you do being a res-

the release of the budget proposal. 
"That is understandable. But it 
also should be understood that 
these cuts, coming on top of deep 
previous budget cuts, would have 
a very serious impact on the 
University of California and its 
tradition of providing a top-quali-
ty, accessible, affordable education 
for Californians." 

Some students sympathized 
with the governor, ' citing a the 
need to balance the budget.

trying," Warren College freshman 
Andy Luke said. "I was expecting 
Schwarzenegger to make some 
kind of crazy cut, but seeing what 
his budget proposal is, I'm not 
unhappy with the increases." 

Schwarzenegger's plan proposes 
a 10 percent increase in fees for res-
ident undergraduates, increasing 
the average fees paid by a resident 
undergraduate to $6,028 after the

Education Abroad 
Program faces cuts 

Students must now pay $100 
fee to enroll in study overseas 
By MARGin GONZALES 

Staff Writer 

As a result of the systemwide 
budget cuts and in anticipation 
of further cuts, the Education 
Abroad Program will face cut-
backs in new program develop-
ment and expansion, possibly 
affecting admissions and costs of 
program participation . 

"There is a 'hold' on new

development and growth system-
wide," said Mary Dhooge, direc-
tor of the International Center. 
"But it will not be terribly dire 
for us, because we have quite a 
bit of flexibility as a campus on 
how we handle individual pro-
grams and application numbers." 

The EAP offers UC students 
the opportunity to study over-
seas at host institutions in 35 
countries in academic programs 
that complement UC criteria. 
The program provides sopho-

Study shows arm positions 
matters in pressure readings 

Researchers from UCSD School of Medicine 
and the Medical College of Wisconsin found 
that blood pressure readings are up to 10 per-
cent higher when an arm is parallel or extend-
ed in the same direction as the body than read-
ings when the elbow is at a right angle. 

The study, which was published in the Jan. 
6 issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine, 
points out that arm position during blood pres-
sure readings could be vital. Values during a

sistent arm positioning should always be used, 
according to the study. 

The study also found that 73 percent of 
health care workers fail to use the proper arm 
and blood pressure cuff positions as defined by 
the American Heart Association. 

The investigation consisted of measuring 
the blood pressures of 100 emergency room 
patients between the ages of 18 to 88 with 
symptoms unlikely to be linked to cardiovascu-
lar instability. Patients' blood pressures were 
measured with parallel and perpendicular arm 
positions while laying, sitting and standing. 
Forty-one percent of patients sitting with their 
arm parallel were found to have blood pres-
sures classified with hypertension, compared 
to 22 percent of patients with the arm perpen-
dicular. 

School of Medicine will 
establish tuberculosis center 

The National Institutes of Health recently 
awarded the UCSD School of Medicine 
Pulmonary Division a five-year $6.2 million 
contract to establish the Tuberculosis 
Curriculum Coordinatins Center. . 

The center will coordinate with a multidiscipli-
nary team of doctors, nurses and health care 
leaders from various health schools to imple-
ment a curriculum using the latest technology for 
education. The TCCC will also work with a con-
sortium of five curriculum centers and 23 partner 
schools. The consortium will indude faculty rep-
resentatives from twelve medical schoofs, six 
nursing schools and 11 health schoofs. 

The five centers working together will indude 
the University of Southem Califomia, Wayne State 
University, University of Texas Health Sciences 
Center, University of Arkansas and Columbia 
University. According to statistics, about 25,000 
people develop active lB and about 5,000 pe0-
ple die from the disease. Additionally, one person 
every second is infected with lB. 

The TCCC Core Group includes UCSD fac-
ulty members Antonino Catanzaro as project 
director, Marguerite Jackson as the administra-
tive unit director, Shawn Harrity for the curricu-
lum unit director and Helene Hoffman as the 
educational technology unit director.

MONDAY. JANUARY 12. 2004 THE UCSD GUARDIAN NEWS 3 

UC CutS: Proposal would raise undergraduate fees by 10 percent 
coTllinllld from page I 

laneous fees. According to the 
College Board, the average fees at 4-
year public IIJliversities is $ 10,636 
for in-s12te residenlS. 

In addition, undergraduate fees 
for non-residents would increase 
by 20 percent and graduate fees 
would increase by 40 percent. 
Students with more than 198 units 
would have to pay additional fees at 
an as-yet-undetermined higher 
rate. The increases have drawn 
strong criticism from students. 

"I'm definitely angry about bud-
get cuts," Sixth College freshman 
Kevin Wood said. "Tuition is 

~ready expe~ve enough, and I 
don't think students should have to 
pay for the mistakes made in 
Sacramento. By sacrificing educa-
tion, lawmakers are sacrificing the 
future of the state." 

The governor is also proposing 
large cuts to financi~ aid to help bal-
ance the budget. Schwarzenegger's 
plan would reduce the percentage of 
new student fees that go toward 
financial aid from 3J percent to 20 

percent, reducing the university's 
financial aid budget by up to one-
third. The proposal would also trim 
the Cal Grant program, which is 
funded by the state government, by 
lowering the rrummwn annual 
income allowed for eligibility by 10 
percent Cal Grants would also cease 
by to match fee increases. 

"I'm not very happy [with the 
budget proposals]," UC Student 
Regent Man Murray said. "The big 
picture is the governor's budget 
makes suggested cuts in many differ-
ent state agencies, trying to spread 
arowtd the cut So on the one hand, 

it~ better than it could have been for 
the university. On the other hand, 
the govemor~ budget doesn't pro-
pose any tax increases, :md I think 
that that~ irrespo~ble and leads to 
things like the very significant 
decreases in financi~ aid and enroll-
ment, which is just saying that we're 
going to protect the wealthy and 
well-off from tax increases and put 
the burden on the poor." 

Schwarzenegger's propos~ also 
calls for a 10 percent reduction in 

enrollment for the 2004-05 school 
year. The reduced enrollment 
would reduce the nwnber of fresh-
men at the University of California 
by 3,200 students, putting in ;~ 
ardy the university's ability to admit 
the top 12.5 percent of each year~ 
graduating class per the California 
Master PI:m for Higher Education. 
The governor~ proposal caDs for 
qualified applicants who aren't 
accepted to attend the California 
Community College system Wlder 
dual admissions programs and 
transfer to a University of California 
or California State University cam-
pus. This reduction would save 
$24.8 million in 2004-05. 

Appe~s to the governor by var-
ious parties to preserve state fund-
ing for K-12 outreach programs 
were also unsuccessful. Despite the 
implementation of $ 12.2 million in 
mid-year cuts and the potential 
elimination of state funding next 
year, the UC Office of the 

- President is working to maintain 
outreach programs. 

"We hope to reach an agree-

ment [with the governor and the 
legislature] to keep outreach fund-
ing on some level," UC spokesman 
Hanan Eisenmann said. 

Other areas impacted by the pr0-
posed reduction are faculty spend-
ing, which would be reduced by 
$35.3 million; administrative funds, 
which would be reduced by $45.4 
million; research, which would be 
reduced by$II.6 million; and fund-
ing for UC Merced, which would be 
reduced by $10 million. 

UCOP had previously estimated 
that UC Merced's 2005 opening -
pushed back from 2004 after mid-
year budget cuts - would require 
$20 million in state funding. 

The power to implement a bud-
get and increase fees ultimately 
rests with the UC Board of 
Regents, with the state only deter-
mining how much the university 
will receive in state funding. 
Nonetheless, the large reduction in 
state funding, if passed by the legis-
lature, would put the university in a 
tough financial position. 

"In theory, the regents can do 

what they want with [state funding], 
but in reality it's a compromise with 
the governor and legislature," 
Murray said. "I don't think it's very 
conunon for the university to do 
something very different from what 
the state suggests ... If the legislature 
accepts the governor's budget, then 
the regents are in a very tough bind. 
But if the legislature doesn't go along 
with this plan, then there's room for 
compromise and 6exibility." 

In the coming months, the 
regents and the administration will 
attempt to determine the cutS' 
impact on the university and to what 
extent they could be implemented. 

Murray indicated that enroll -
ment cuts would be the Regents' first 
priority, as admissions officers have 
already begun considering applica-
tions for the coming academic year. 

Schwarzenegger expressed con-
fidence that his cuts would resolve 
the budget crisis. 

"Together, the legislature and I 
will take California out of the poor 
house and make it once again a pow-
erhouse," Schwarzenegger said. 

Commuters: All .. campus board to address parking issues, build community 
continued from page I 

ident," said Becky Lee, co-chair of 
the Marshall Commuter Council. 
"Some colleges don't even have 
commuter boards, so there's -a 
whole community at UCSD that's 
being excluded from programming 
because they don't have anyone to 
run [events) ." 

Lee, who helped author the 
board's charter, hopes that the new 
organization will be able to create; a 
community for transfer students. 

"Hopefully, we'll be doing a lot 
of programming that isn't on the 
UCSD campus," Lee said. "We'll 
do events at T.G.I. Friday's, we'll 
do things that aren't necessarily in 

Price Center or aren't on Library 
Walk. They'll be more accessible 
for commuters." 

Raza Mobin, chair of the Muir 
College Commuter Council, wel-
comed the lobbying power the a11-
campus commuter Qrganization 
will provide. 

"It's lrind of hard to build up 
strong organizations in the colleges 
because commuters tend to kind of 
want to go home and not re~ly 
want to stay late at night for meet-
ings that we have," Mobin said. "A 
UCSD-wide organization will have 
more say and more power, like lob-
bying power, th:m smaller organi-
zations in a specific college." 

Gallagher, who sponsored the 
legislation, expressed that it is the 
A.S. Council's obligation to fill 
voids in the student services pro-
vided by the university administra-
tion. 

"A lot of students who don't live 
in the dorms their freshman year 
don't really have that network of 
friends," Gallagher said. 
"Hopefully this space will provide 
[a place] to help start intramural 
teams, ... a place where people can 
just get to know people." 

With the anticipated North 
Campus Housing project and 
Revelle Parking Structure con-
struction threatening to displace 

parlring spaces beginning in the 
summer, parking will be a central 
issue for commuter students, 
according to Mobin. 

"A main issue is parking,:md in 
that aspect, commuters aren't real-
ly taken care of as much as they 
should be," Mobin said. "[The all-
campus board] is just another way 
for commuters to get their voices 
heard." 

Thurgood Marshall College 
senior and commuter Viet Tran 
agreed. 

"EspeciaJly finals week or 
midterm week, everybody's at 
school and it's hard to find a park-
ing spot," Tran said. "I'm very 

happy because now there's a central 
organization that we can go to .. . to 
get our issues to corne to the fore-
front. " 

Lee hopes that the all-campus 
commuter board will spend winter 
quarter building a framework for 
the new organization and will begin 
programming in spring quarter. 

The board's charter calls for the 
distribution of a bi-quarterly 
newslerter in apartment complexes 
and other housing surrounding 
UCSD as well as the development 
of a Web site to inform studellls of 
programming opporrunities. 

"The more opportunities we give 
students, the bener," Gallagher said.

ecurl aty 
fingerti New requirements are only 

a small inconvenience 
By KAJ ROlGA 

Contributing Writer 

The only way to suc-
cessfully fil ter out terrorists 
at U.S. borders is through 
taking the initiative, and , as 
Sept. 11 , 2001 showed, the 
onl y successful type of 
counter-terrori sm is an 
active one. There fore, 
some of the firs t defensive 
policies enacted following 
the terrorist attack, like the 
Aviation and 
Tra nsporta tion Security 
Act of 2001 , involved pro-
tecting America's vulnera-
ble doorways, specifically 
its airports. 

T he recently created 
United States Visitor and 
Immigrant Status Indicator 
Techn ology system is a 
necessa ry progression of 
these initial policies and 
wi II further strengthen 
defense against terrorist 
penetra tion of U.S. bor-
ders. Its procedures merely 
expand upon previous 
methods of ga thering 
infor mation on individuals 
entering and exiti ng the 
United States (short ques-
tioning and an inspection 
of travel docu ments) while 
minimizing thei r inconve-
nience. 

The main features 
added to the process are a 
biometric scanning of fin -
gerprints and a d igita l 
photo that is ta ken of 
incoming travelers. Upon 
exi ting the country, indi-
viduaï¿½s will have their fin-
gerprints scanned again 
and their visas wi ll go 
through a machine that 
logs their departure. 

The U.S.-Y.I.S.I.T . pro-
gram signals a revolution-
ary transformation in 
airport security and 
the tracking of inter-
natio nal travelers. 
The intensive scan-
ning of incoming 
people allows intell i-
ge nce officia ls to 
stop terrorists before 
they leave the airport 
and ente r a vast 
country with unlim-
ited hiding places. 
Furthermore, the 
gathering of accurate 
data allows intell i-
gence officials new 
means of tracki ng 
travelers and fi nding 
hints of susp icious 
acti vi ty, such as an 
unau thori zed exten-
sion of a visit, and to 
act o n them. 

U .S .- V.I.S .I. T . 
also ushers ina new 
wave of technology 
that will lay the 
groundwork for a 
more effective sys-
te m of identifying 
people with biomet-

which looks at key features 
of a person 's fingerprints 
that cannot be imitated. It 
will ensure that the identity 
of a visa holder is legiti-
mate and consistent. 
O verall, U.S. -V.I.S.I.T. 
stands to serve as a power-
ful tool in the war on ter-
rorism. 

However, much criti-
cism has emerged of the 
program's implementation. 
Reasons for its proposed 
elimination include accusa-
tions that it is invasive, 
unfairly selective and time-
consuming. 

The ACLU's complaints 
of unfair selectivi ty are 
unfounded, as U .S.-
Y. I.S.I.T. will check all 

PRO 
incoming visitors on non-
immigrant (tourist, busi -
ness, student and tempo-
rary worker) visas, regard -
less of any background 
information such as race, 
ethnicity or country of ori-
gin . The ACLU claims that 
the new system will further 
"confuse" travelers, though 
the ease and swiftness with 
which the process is enact-
ed , in addition to the pres-
ente of personnel to assist 
individuals, casts enormous 
doubt on this assertion . 

Another common griev-
ance by civil libertarians is 
that U .S.-Y.I.S .I.T. proce-

dures are an

invasion of one 's ~rivacy. 
However, there IS no 
searching of bags, no long 
interviews, and in fact very 
little intrusion of any kind. 
And if every database of 
people that is designed 
spurs fears of George 
Orwell 's "1984," society 
will never be able to imple-
ment its superior technolo-
gy for purposes of self-
defense and might as well 
give up its counter-terror-
ism efforts; previous tacti cs 
have proved vasdy insuffi-
cient and the need fo r 
change is clearly manifest. 

To address the possible 
burden that U.S.-Y.I.S.I.T. 
would place on travelers, 
studies performed by the 
Department of Homeland 
Security since Nov. 17, 2003 
at Hartsfield-J ackson 
Atlanta International 
Airport showed, according 
to a press release, that "the 
new procedures add anuver-
age of 15 seconds to the 
entry process." This experi -
ment involved over 20,000 
passengers and its results 
reveal the minimal negative 
impl ications of this pro-
gram's enactment o n the 
average traveler's trip. 

If the United States is 
hesitant to place such small 
burdens on its incoming 
travelers, it will never pre-
sent a formidable challenge 
to thwart and deter terror-
ists ' attempts at entering 
the country. Though forc-
ing innocent individuals to 
fingerprint themselves is 
both awkward and inconve-
nient, sacri fices of comfort 
must be made to address a 
greater priority: homeland 
defense. After all, travel to

Registering foreign visitors is 
retlliniscent of Nazi Gennany 

By LOGANGOH 
Senior Staff Writer 

At first glance it's really 
hard to see what the big hoo-
hah is all about. 

The new United States 
Visitor and Immigrant Status 
Indicator, Technology proce-
dure was well planned. The 
reponed increase in process-
ing time per visitor is only an 
average of 15 seconds -
barely worth mentioning. 
There is no invasive cavity 
search, no implanting of 
tracking modules in the slrull, 
just a fingerprinting and a 
photograph. There is no vio-
lation of the fifth amend-
ment, no invasion of privacy 
at all, unless you ascribe some 
deeply personal meaning to 
the whirls on your left and 
right index fingers. It seems 
the voicing of any kind of 
objection would be silly, as 
we can not forget that this 
minor inconvenience quite 
possibly will save lives. 

However, serious con-
cerns lie beneath the surface 
of this seemingly benign pol-
ICY. 

The U.S.-Y.I.S.I.T. policy 
is really no different from 
institutionalized racial profil-
ing - country profiling, if 
you will. For the policy to be 
fair, roerybody, including U.S. 
citizens, should have to go 
through the procedure. 
Assuming that terrorists are 
more lilcely to come from 
cenain countries is hardly 
different from assuming 
that certain crimes are 
mQre likely to be com-
mitted by black peo-
ple. In both cases 
there 

is a smidgen of truth - but 
not enough to justify being 
unfairly prejudiced against 
the innocent majority. 

Perhaps some warning 
should be taken from the 
events that led up to the 
Holocaust. Nazi Germanys 
registration of the Jews was 
what made it possible for 
Hitler to detain them, and 
eventually send them to the 
concentration camps. 
Registering citizens seemed 
to be a fairly innocent action 
- an action which, for the 

(ON 
Jews, led to the gross abuse of 
governmental power. 

Those now being finger-
printed may face similar gov-
ernmental abuse in the ' 
future. 

Then, the problem was 
that there were no sufficient 
safeguards present 
in the German 
poli tical system to 
keep the govern-
ment from seizing 
dictatorial control 
over the country. 
The people (not 

r 

all of them, just enough) 
trusted the government 
would not abuse power, and 
did not realize their mistake 
until it was too late. 

The more power in the 
hands of the government, the 
more powerful the govern-
ment is. The USA Patriot 
Act has significantly curtailed 
civil liberties, and the new 
U.S.-Y.I.S.I.T. program 
promises to do more of the 
same. We should always be 
wary of what civil liberties we 
sacrifice, lest we lose them 
all. 

Finally, this new finger-
printing policy further rein-
forces the new image of 
"Forness America." Bush's 
policies and actions are 
increasingly leading to 
America's isolation from the 
rest of the world. Besides 
needing trading partners and 
the obvious foolishness of 
getting the entire world to 
gang up on us, projecting the 
image that all visitors are 
"dangerous" will just increase 
fear and paranoia, making it 
even less possible for us to 
relate to the needs of other 

cultures.

~ I LmERS TO THE EDITORS 
A.S.T.R.O. conbibutes 
without much cost 
Editor: 

The Opinion piece in favor 
of "Axing Outreacb" by Kaj 
Rozga, in the Monday, Jan. 5, 
2004 issue of the GrumJilm, cites 
one campus-based program, 
Project A.S.T.R.O., as an example 
of an "exorbitant [state-funded] 
program" which should be "tem-
porarily cut." 

In fact, this article misrepre-
sents Project A.S.T.R.O. in every 
possible way. Two basic tenets of 
journalism, checking your facts, 
and giving those you criticize the 
opportunity to respond, seem to 
have been too much trouble for 
this freshman author. Had he 
bothered to contact me, or at the 
very least scroll down our Web 
site, he might bave learned: 

1. For 2003-04, we proposed 
for and were awarded a modest 
$3,800 grant from NASA. These 
funds were ge'nerously matcbed, 
2-1, by the Edwards Foundation 
- a private, out-of-state charita-
ble organization which also 
received a proposal. So, in fact, 
we are bringing outside money 
into the state and spending it 
here! If only larger programs 
could do this! Even our logistical 
support from UCSD (ph.one, 
Web site, etc.) has been provided 
gratis by a campus Organized 
Research Unit, Center for 
Astrophysics and Space Sciences, 
which operates mainly on federal 
funds . (NASA, National Science 
Foundation) - and pays a hefty 
overhead into the UC system as a 
result. With these ami other 
donated resources, mainly from 
San Diego State, Project 

A.S.T.R .O . volunteers provide 
7,200 hours of bands-on student 
instruction in 25 San Diego 
County schools, in addition to

of the California Earth Science

for $3 ,800 in federal fu nds -

are we? 
2. We are not an "Astronomy 

for Educators" program "to help 
fourth grade teachers .... " Our 
Web site, the author's sole infor-
mation source, says no such thing! 
Our manpower is provided by 
local professional and amateur sci -
entists who volunteer to work 
with kids directly in the class-
room, and these people should be 
praised for their service in educat-
ing our local children. (We work 
with grades four through nine by 
the way - it's right there on our 
Web site). 

Our main goal is to inspire 
children to engage in scientific 
discovery. Astronomy is a great 
vehicle for doing this (e.g. how 
many amateurs do you know in 
any other scientific field?). And 
our program puts the talents and 
enthusiasm of local volunteer 
scientists where it's needed - in 
the classroom, alongside the 
teacher. 

You can learn more about our 
frugal, non-state-funded, highly 
successful and enjoyable program, 
Project A.S.T.R.O., from me per-
sonally or by carefully reading the 
words on our Web site. We are 
always looking for volunteers who 
have some knowledge of astronomy 
(amateur, professional or student) 
to work in the classroom, and for 
private donations to provide work-
shops, classroom materials and 
year-round suppon for our volun-
teers. Donations will be matched by 
the Edwards Foundation for the 
rest of the school year, and we are 
always pl~d to provide a detailed 
account of how our funds are spent.

OPINION 5 

Sex education is key 
to sexual responsibility 

Big Sis 
aaire J. Yannette 

The Nt1lI York Times delivered heartening news to my inboll over Christmas break: 
Teen birthrate and abortion num-
bers are down, implying that fewer 
girls and young women are getting 
pregnant. The Alan Guttrnacher 
Institute estimates that the preg-
nancy ra te for girls 15 to 19 years 
old dropped from 11.5 per 1,000 in 
1991 to 8.5 in 1999. 

I take a special interest in such 
6gures - maybe because I work in 
secondary education and am 
invested in the well-being of 
American high schoolers, maybe 
because my mother was just 19 
when she became pregnant with 
me, or maybe because sell and fam-
ily have long been interests of 
mine. In any case, I can't help but 
cheer what seems to be increasing 
sellUal responsibility among the 
nation's youth. 

Naturally, both sides of the sex 
education debate are claiming vic-
tory - and credit - in response to 
Guttmacher and the Centers for 
Disease Control numbers. 
Abstinence-only sex education 
advocates - those lilce President 
Bush, who hope to prepare 
American children for adulthood 
with only platitudes about the sanc-
tity of marriage and notoriously 
sketchy figures about the failure 
rate of condoms - point to indica-

tions that teens are, in fact, having 
less sex. A CDC survey shows that 
while 51 percent of high school 
girls and 57 percent of high school 
boys reported having had sex in 
1991, in 2001 the respective num-
bers were 43 percent and 48 per-
cent. Couple this with last decade's 
ascendant abstinence-only sex edu-
cation programs and virginity-
pledge campaigns, and social con-
servatives have plenty to be happy 
about. 

So do comprehensive sex educa-
tion advocates like me. The afore-
mentioned CDC survey also 
reponed that while fewer than half 
of sexually active high school stu-
dents reported using condoms in 
1991, by 2001 the figure was up to 
57 percent - still not nearly high 
enough, but a promising increase. 
Two-thirds of public school sex 
education programs teach about 
condom usage, and many UCSD 
students may remember the cheer-
ful educator who commandeered 
their classroom one day armed with 
statistics and suggestive vegetables. 
Teens' awareness of safer sex has 
also benefited from pop cultural 
exposure: condom commercials, 
radio programs like "Loveline" and 
even rap lyrics from the likes of 
Snoop and Ludacris promote pro-
tection. 

A combination of both 
approaches - comprehensive and 
abstinence-only - is probably 
behind the Guttmacher and CDC 
numbers . For whatever reason, 
kids are having less sex, and when 
they do have it, it's smarter and 
safer, with fewer potentially disas-

trous consequences Oike babies). 
T hat's great, but it doesn't allay 

my fear of abstinence-only sex ed, 
and of the Times report that 

. instead of distributing condoms, 
as comprehensive sex-ed work-
shop leaders often do, one chasti-
ty-belt-hawker "urged any stu-
dents who had condoms to drop 
them off in a box near the coun-
selor's office." Irs admirable to 
encourage teens to save sex for the 
ideally nurturing, safe and satisfy-
ing confines of marriage, but to 
promote the disposal of condoms 
is downright idiotic. In such cases, 
it becomes clear that much of 
abstinence-only sex ed goes 
beyond the legitimate secular 
desire to reduce the teen birthrate, 
and crosses into the slantwise pro-
motion of the religious conviction 
that only sex between married 
people is acceptable. 

But maybe I'm hopelessly 
biased. I consider myself a com-
prehensive sex ed success story. As 
a fi fth-grader, I volunteer~d at my 
citys AIDS Task Force, stuffing 
envelopes wi th safer-sex 
brochures and handing out con-
doms at drag queen softball 
games. My elementary, junior 
high and high schools had frank 
and open programs that empha-
sized abstinence as the only one-
hundred-percent effective way to 
avoid pregnancy and disease, but 
recognized the overwhelming 
likelihood that most of us students 
would have more than one sex 
partner in our lives and thus 
taught us how to be safe if that was 
our decision. And here I am, 21 
years old, sexually active thank-
you-very-much, and not pregnant 
or diseased or plagued by trou-
bling sexual encounters. 

Interestingly, the CDC has 
linked mother-adolescent commu-

nication to future sexual practices. 
Teens whose mothers talked to 
them about condom usage before 
the lcids became sexually active 
were three times more likely to use 
condoms than those who never 
discussed condoms with their 
moms or only discussed it after 
already becoming sexually active. 

" Could it be that public 
school sex education 
ultimately pales in 

comparison with the 
informarion and attitudes 
one receives at home?" 

This study was conducted in 
1998 - about the time my mom 
and I had our most serious in an 
intermittent series of "talks" 
about sex. I was sixteen - I had 
been caught making out with my 
first high school boyfriend -
and 1 think she was suddenly 
overwhelmed by the obvious 
change in a daughter who had 
been insisting just a few years 
before that she intended to wait 
until marriage for sex. So over 
the course of a few days, over 
dinner at Acapulco or in our lit-
tle house, we chatted. It was 
probably hcre that my sexualiry 
was ceme nted. 

"The thing about women in 
our family and sex," my mother 
said, perched on my bathroom 
counter, "is that we like it, and 
we're good at it." I suddenly felt 
Ii ke part of a grand tradition of 
strong, healthy women with 
strong, healthy appetites, and that 

feeling was a crucial part of my 
decision to wait almost four years 
before actually having SCL I want-
ed to live up to the tradition, 
which did not involve getting car-
ried away in cramped backseats 
with fumbling high school boys. I 
would wait until I knew the time 
was right, and I did. 

When I was sixteen, my moth-
er succeeded in keeping my vir-
ginity intact for a while, and 
maybe that was her only terrified 
goal, but I like to think she also set 
out to give me that positive atti-
tude about my own sexuality -
the best protection against physi-
cally and psychologically risky 
business like unprotected sex or 
encounters one regrets the next 
morning. 

Could it be that public 
school sex education ultimately 
pales in comparison with the 
information and attitudes one 
receives at home? Lots of stud-
ies emphasize the importance of 
the school day, with its instruc-
tion from teachers and peers, in 
child development, but it's 
important not to .underestimate 
the effect parenting can have, 
for good or ill . If framed in the 
right way, the events of my 
childhood and adolescence 
might seem to lead to sexual and 
romantic disaster: divorced par-
ents, running with a "fast 
crowd" and some things the edi-
tor of this publication would 
undoubtedly prefer I not men-
tion here. But because my 
mother was wise enough to 
impart wisdom and foster self-
respect in me, I have not 
become a statistic - or a prude.

coruim4ed from page 4 
the United States is a privilege, 
not a right. 

International cntlClsm of 
U .S.-y'I.S.I.T. is also highly 
unreasonable. Many of these 
nations have never faced terror-
ism, let alone the scale of which 
the United States is fighting, and 
therefore have no right to impose 
on America their standards of 
security and civil rights. There is 
no pretext for the 9/ II attacks 
and therefore no pretext for the 
limits of a nation in protecting 
itself from transnational terror-
ism of the brand that the United 
States faces. 

Furthermore, those nations that 
have been plagued by major acts of 
terrorism, like Israel, have taken 
far more drastic courses of action 
to monitor the flow of individuals 
through their borders. The most 
CItreme policies recommended by 
U.S. officials and politicians are 
dwarfed by airpon security mea-
sures employed under the Israeli 
Airpon Authority, which include 
intensive searches by heavily armed 
guards, rigorous background 
checks, a profiling system that 
would infuriate the most steadfast 
reactionaries among us and pro-
longed and intimidating inter-
views. 

Due to the immense terrorist 
threat that Israel faces, criticism 
for its actions has been minimal , 
and rightly so. So, why is the 
United States still held to such an 
unfair level of scrutiny by the 
international community when 
the death toll of the Sept. II 
attacks surpassed the aggregated 
total of all terrorist attacks on 
Israel? With or without compari-
son, U.S. policies of airport secu-
rity are both reasonable and tem-

pered. 
U.S.-y.I.S.I.T. is by no means 

a complete solution; indeed it will 
inspect only a fraction of the 500 
million annual visitors to the 
United States. However, it is, as 
Secretary of Homeland Security 
Tom Ridge stated, the "first sig-
nificant step in a series of steps" 
to form not only a strong border 
defense, but also a meaningful 
deterrent of terrorism. 

If the recent hi gh terror alerts 
taught us anything, it is that the 
threat of a large-scale terrorist 
attack is a reality that must be 
dealt with. There is no reason to 
appropriate billions of taxpayer 
dollars to the Department of 
Homeland Security for the pur-
pose of protecting the nation if it 
is not allowed to safeguard 
America's weakest leg - its air-
ports - to its fullest ability. 

There has been a dramatic 
reassessment of risk management 
post-9fll and the U .S.-Y.I.S.I.T. 
program is a continuation of the 
progress made by the Bush 
administration in playing an 
active role in counter-terrorism. 

There are many arguments that 
criticize U.S.-Y.I.S.I.T., but few 
offer any solutions to help secure 
U.S. borders. Instead, most criticism 
falls on the inconveniences and 
logistical obstacles of enacting such 
a policy. Passivity and inaction, how-
ever, proved to be the crucial weak-
nesses in U.S. defense that allowed 
the attacks of Sept. II , 200 I to 
occur. Therefore, the Departnlent 
of Homeland Security has taken 
important preliminary steps in 
expanding the ability of the United 
States to better guard its points of 
entry from potential terrorists and 
other dangerous individuals, and for 
that it should be applauded.

since the 1980s, Lagos was one of 
the principle actors in helping to 
bring down Chile's former dicta-
tor, Gen. Augusto Pinochet. Since 
his election in 2000, Lagos has led 
the country to economic growth, 
cutting the country's poverty rate 
in half. Lagos studied law at the 
University of Chile and received a 
doctorate in economics from 
Duke University. 

"Just the fact that the economy 
has prospered as much as it has, is 
just inspiring to other Latin 
American countries, and it was 
interesting to hear some of his 
opinions," said Adriana Ambriz, a 
Thurgood Marshall College senior. 

During his speech , Lagos 
spoke about the necessity of build-
ing bridges between his country 
and the United States. 

"The Americans and Chile 
belong to one hemi phere, and we 
share common values," Lagos 
said. "Those values that we share 
make it possible to see in a com- . 
mon way the future. Now is the 
time to break down barriers that 
exist among our people." 

Lagos also spoke about the dif-
ferent aspects of his country's 
growth. He stated that there are 
areas of common values in which 
the foundation of the bridge can 
be built upon, including democra-
cy, human rights, economic sys-
terns and social cohesion. 

"The commitment to human 
rights means that all of us have to 
act in a consistent manner using 
democratic methods to fight 
against terrorism, beca use terror-
ism is the final expression of denial 
of human rights," Lagos said. 

Lagos also discussed the 
importance of creating strong 
public policies, including provid-
ing citizens with education and 
housing. After his speech,

Insti tute of the Americas 
President Jeffrey Davidow asked 
Lagos questions ranging from 
free-trade agreements and the 
relationship between Cuba and 
other countries in Latin America, 
to the roles of the United States 
and the United Nations. 

The Institute of the Americas, 
an organization working to bring 
government and business leaders 
from the Americas to discuss 
issues of globalization, govern-
mental regulations and poverty 
alleviation, presented its award to 
Lagos during a luncheon given in 
his honor. Established in 1987, the 
award recognizes contributions in 
areas of democracy, peace and 
social and economic reform in the 
Americas. Other recipients of the 
award include President Oscar 
Arias Sanchez of Costa Rica, 
President Carlos Saul Menem of 
Argentina and most recendy, in 
2001, President Ernesto Zedillo 

of Mexico. 
"Lagos is the principle actor in 

the restoration of democracy in 
Chile and the promotions of 
Chile's economic prosperity," 
Davidow said. "Lagos led his coun-
try to signing a free trade agree-
ment with the United States." 

Some attendees of the public 
lecture commented that the 
Lagos' speech was helpful in 
understanding more about Chile. 
Thurgood Marshall College 
junior Estercita Aldinger said that 
although she previously did not 
know much about Lagos, his pre-
sentation helped her discover 
more about the country. 

"It's refreshing to see a presi-
dent that actually stands for the 
ideals that should be stood for, 
especially in Latin America where 
we lack a lot of good policies that 
actually change the country for 
the better," Aldinger said. "It 
seems that Lagos did that."

EAP: Enrollment expected to increase 
continlll!d from page I 

other campuses in UCSD, must 
cease expansion, according to A.S. 
Commissioner of Academic 
Mfairs Todd Tolin. However, the 
amount of people expected to 
apply to the program is expected 
to increase, which means possible 
caps on EAP enrollment, Tolin 
said. 

McCarren refuted this state-
ment, saying EAP has always had 
a few programs with limited 
capacity, and if there were more 
applicants than allotted space, 
EAP would designate alternates. 
For other program!;, the universi-
ty would request more spaces for 
the following school year than the 
number of spaces fiHed up the 
previous school year, McCarren 
said. 

"UCSD requested more spaces 
for the 2004-05 school year than 
we filled for the 2003-04 school 
year," McCarren said. "And EAP 
has granted many of those extra 
spaces, so we do not anticipate 
having to turn students away from 
those programs. There will be no 
growth above the 2004-05 num-
bers for 2005-06." 

Due to the extensive budget 
cuts, EAP will not be able to 
expand in administrative help for 
an already understaffed office. 

"These budget cuts also put 
further strain on an already over-
worked office," Tolin said. "The 
EAP offices currently have the

highest ratio of students to advi-
sors of any other systemwide 
office and will need to seek assis-
tance from Academic and Student 
Affairs to keep up with demand." 

Eleanor Roosevelt College 
freshman Hannah Tchon described 
the staff in the EAP office. 

"I went into the EAP office 

and everyone was so busy," Tchon 
said. "There were about ten peo-
ple waiting in line, and some peo-
ple had to reschedule their 
appointments because it was so 
busy." 

In addition to thes~ holds, a 
requisite database costing 
$800,000 will have to be added to 
the EAP because of new 
Homeland Security regulations, 
according to Tolin. 

"This translates to a $100 fee 
increase to students entering the 
program," Tolin said. 

Tolin is concerned that this fee 
increase may cause some students to 
reconsider enrolling in the program. 

"I feel that these programs 
allow for a true university experi-
ence of learning 'beyond the 
books,'" Tolin said. 

For some students, the EAP 
cutbacks are just a minor setback. 

"The possible limitation with-
in the programs, in addition to the 
$ I 00 fee increase is discouraging," 
Tchon said. "However, if in cwo 
years I stiH want to go, the fee 
increase won't stop me, It's just 
that all the complications cause 
me to be hesitant about it." 

BAC: Price Center to double in size by 2007 
contillUtd from (XICt 7 

in organizing building space, 
directing foot traffic, and dealing 
with shuttle and automobile Stops 
and parking. He also presented the 
possible total square footage of the 
revamped Price Center, which 
would shoot from the current area 
of 170,000 square feet to possibly 
360,000 square feet. 

Underclassmen can look forward 
to a Price Center nearly double its 
current size by fall of 2007, accord-
ing to the BAC's current proposals. 

The expansion, according to 
Max Harrington, A.S. representa-
tive to the BAC, is a much-needed 
change to the UCSD campus. 

"The food court bursts at the 
seams with hungry students every 
day at lunchtime, and the campus 
will grow by up to 8,000 students 
over the next seven years, worsen-
ing an already serious problem," 
Harrington said. "The Price 
Center expansion will not only help 
alleviate the problems we have with 
our current spaces, but it will create 

space for a whole host of new ser-
vices that we have never had on 
campus - such as a bank and a 
grocety store." 

Harrington also expressed the 
desire to create a Price Center that 
not only meets user needs, but 
achieves a high standard of resource 
consumption, incorporating stan-
dards such as "a low use of potable 
water, highly efficient use of electric-
ity, use of recycled building materials 
and materials that are manufactured 
from sustainable sources."

~ I PROFILE: DAVE KELLEn 
From humble beginnings as 

a cartoonist for the 

Guardian to rubbing elbows 
with the great comic strips 

Ever wonder what it's like to make people laugh for a living? For cartoonist and UCSD alumnus Dave Kellett, this question 
is no longer a wonder but a daily reality. Seven 
years ago, Kellett was a struggling, albeit happy, 
student pursuing his masters degree at UCSD. 
Today he is on the brink of national syndication 
with United Media. 

How did he come this far? It all started with 
his personal motivation and his acceptance into 
UCSD. 

As a San Diego native, Kellett was always 
aware of UCSD as "this university on a hill." 
After obtajning his undergraduate degree at the 
University of Notre Dame, he returned to his 
home base to earn a graduate degree in literature 
at UCSD. His professors let him craft a master's 
degree that allowed him to research how litera-
ture and cartoons intersected in 18th-century 
Britain. 

"They let me marry my two loves, which 
were literature and cartooning," Kellett said. 
"Cartooners are essentially writers first and 
artists second. Nothing brings me more joy 
than a well -turned phrase, especially one that 
brings a laugh from the reader. When they're at 
their best, cartoons can change opinions in a 
way that no essay, editorial or novel ever 
could." 

While at UCSD, Kellett produced three edi-
torial cartoons a week: one for the GUIlT dian and 
cwo for the San Diego Unirm-Tribune, where he 
interned. 

"FQr a 21-year-old kid, that's fantastic!" 
Kellett said of the experience. "Both of the news-
papers had a large audience; they gained me pub-
licity and taught me real-world lessons about car-
tooning. It made me aware that I could work as a 
cartoonist - that not only did I 'UllI1It to do it, I 
rouJJ do it." 

Following his internship, Kellett knew that 
he had to pursue his love of comic strips. While 
at UCSD, he won a Rotary Foundation schol-
arship for $22,000, affording him the opportu-
nity to stay at the University of Kent in 
Canterbury, England, to study World War II 
cartoons and their use in propaganda. In possi-
bly the most exciting year of his life, Kellett 
met still- living cartoonists from World War II 
and fervently dug through cartoon archives at 
the British Records Office and the British War 
Museum. 

As a sort of 'letter home,' Kellett wanted to 
share the comic strips he had produced with 
friends and family in the United States. The 
most efficient way to do this, he found, was 
through the World Wide Web. For the first time 
in his life, he assembled a Web site showcasing 

his comic strip "Sheldon" on a regular basis. 
The cornic's plot revolves around ten-year-

old Sheldon, who develops a type of software 
that not only enhances Internet speed but 
launches the creation of his own software com-
pany, Sheldonsoft, second only to Microsoft in 
size. Ironically, Sheldon is raised by his grand-
father, who is technologically inept and lost to 
the world's advances. As a strictly personal 
experiment, Sheldon crea tes a companion, 
Duck, by downloading speech recognition soft-
ware and the Encyclopedia Britannica into the 
brain of an average pond-dwelling fowl. After 
Sheldon is through with hjm, Duck can talk 
and hold conversations as well as any other 
human being. 

However, Sheldon is not your typical bil-
lionaire, boy genius - he still prefers to spend 
his time hanging out at the local swimming 
hole with Duck or watching television, making 
only occasional appearances at the office. His 
best friend Dante represents "the dumber 
friend we've all had" who compensates for 
intellectual lackluster with his social magnet-
ism and athletic ability. Sheldon's relationship 
with Dante explores pure friendship in a world 
that views Sheldon as simply a billionaire and 
child oddity. 

As with any artist, Kellett's creations reflect 
parts of his own personality. 

"Sheldon is the nerdier side of you that you 
hope succeeds in life," Kellett said. "Duck is that 
sarcastic voice in the bade of your mind." 

Each long-standing character contains 
aspects of "hopefully everyone's character," as 
the ability of an audience to relate to the car-
toons is a cartoonist's greatest triumph, accord-
ing to Kellett. 

Of his Website wonder, Kellett said, "At first 
it was just for family, but the audience grew to a 
few thousand by the time of my return to the 
States." 

Kellett was getting closer 
to his ultimate goal of pub-
lishing a strip in U.S. news-
papers, but he was not there 
yet. 

"Newspapers are a 
shrinlcing market," he said. 
"Vety few cities now have 
more than one newspaper 
per town. For example, the 
SII1I Diego Unirm-Tribune is a 

conglomerate of the S{1n 
Diego Union and the San Diego 
Tribune. What this means for 
cartooning is that it's a much 
harder industry to break into 
than it was }ears ago." 

DlIVe Kellett 
This UCSD 
alumnus is 
bringing his 

dreams to life w~h 
'Sheldon' comics. 

According to Kellet, the key in overcoming 
these obstacles lies in finding a syndicate, 
which acts as an agent, manager, distributor 
and accountant for cartoon artists. Each syndi-
cate provides a gateway into the 1,500 newspa-
pers in the United States. Kellett attempted to 
get syndicate recognition by regularly submit-
ting batches of samples to be 'picked up' for 
distribution while simultaneously maintaini ng 
his Web site, where the readership doubled 
every few months. For a while, his attempts 
appeared to be fruitless. 

"Every year, each syndicate receives on 
average 5,000 applicants, and they only choose 
one or two Out of that pool," Kellett said of the 
fierce competition. "You almost have to wait 
for someone to quit or die because there are so 
few slots. Once people become attached to a 
comic strip, they never want to give it up. You 
may recall that the cartoonist for 'Peanuts,' 
Charles Schultz, passed away, but his strip is 
nill being published." 

It turns out that his submissions weren't what 
gained Kellett his recognition after all - rather, 
it was the Web site that had initially begun as a 
letter home to his family. United Media, the 
largest syndicate in the nation, happened upon 
his web site and approached Kellett about his 
work. 

"At that point my heart really dropped down 
into my stomach," he said. 

United Media liked Kellett's comic strip so 
much that they offered to bring Sheldon onto

FAQ on REEF Financing 
Question: How .r. Educdon Investments different fro ... 10M? 
A ... w.r: loans are sums of money lent at interest. Education Investments 
are sums of money disbursed to students at no interest. The obligation of 
an Education Investment is based on a fixed percentage of future income 
for a fixed period oftime. This program allows flexibility in obligation according 
to your economic situation. Which means, you pay less when you have less 
and more when you have more. 
Question: C.n the .. Idue_lon Inv .. tlnents ..., for .11 of my tuition? 
A ... w.r: Education Investments are a great complement for students that 
have already received grants, scholarships and federal loans, but still need 
more money for their living costs. REEF can help students fill the gap between 
what you have and what you need. REEF will fund a maximum of $ 10,000 
for cost of attendance expenses per school year.

lifelong passion.

With this in mind, he said, "If 

you can somehow marry your 
career with what you love to do, 
then you'll have many happy years. 
Keep plugging along ... go into it 
with the awareness that it will take 
you years to get to a success level

know deep down that it's going to 
be well wonh it. And in the mean-
time, you're making people

team will achieve chemistry that 
will help it during the tough

conrinued from page 20 

the season, however, he may have 
difficulty matching these times. 

"It's just a question of whether 
he'll get back in shape in time," 
McGihon said. 

Besides Pearce's win, the UCSD 
men earned one first-place finish in 
the ZOO-yard freestyle relay. The 
team, comprised of jWlior Mark 
1ate, sophomore Mike Isaacs, fresh-
man Andy Harutunian and senior 
Rob Small, clocked in at 1:26.38. 

In addition to his win in the 
relay, Small claimed second in the 
lOO-yard breaststroke (58.98). 
Other second places forÂ· the men 
included freshman Tim Fuller's 
200-yard freestyle (I :44.69) and 
freslunan Mike Lahey's lOO-yard 
and ZOO-yard backstrokes, 54.75 
and I :58.08, respectively. 

The men's diving team was also 
defeated by Utah. UCSD's best 
showing was diver Dan Grodhs 
third place finish in the !lI1e-meter. 

Because Utah has no female 
divers, the UCSD women's team 
competed against UCLA and lost, 
32-6. When the swimmers face 
UCLA next weekend, the diving 
score will be talcen into account in 
the final score. 

"It was a close meet," McGihon 
said. "We definitely have more 
depth than they have. Their num-
ber-one swimmers were faster than 
our number-one swimmers today. " 

After the meet against Utah, the 
women's dual meet record dropped 
to 3-3 and the mens to 1-4. Both 
McGilton and the swinuners are 
hoping that UCSD will do well in 
the upcoming dual meets. 

The men have several weeks off 
while the women compete against 
schools that have no mens swim-
ming programs. 

The women wiD swim against 
UCLA on Jan- 17 and against 
University of San Diego on Jan. 24. 

"We have reaDy been working 
hard the past few weeks and our 
bodies are extremely fatigued," 
junior co-captain Christine Hyjek 
said. "It would have been nice to 
have swum faster, but I know we 
will have a better showing against 
UCLA and USD. USD is going to 
be our big dual meet of this quar-
ter." 

else, we just have to get used to 
playing together and believing in 
the people that are nen to you on 
the court. I think partly what I'm 
looking for is the commitment 
level of the guys on the court to 
each other," Larsen said. "I'm

looking for us to have some kind

If the team can achieve the kind 
of chemistry that Larsen describes, 
UCSD has the potential to turn 
some heads in the MPSF this sea-
son.

18 SPORTS ntE UCSD GUARDIAN MONDAY, JANUARY 12,2004 

Honors: Tritons receives nine national, conference and regional awards 
continued from page 20 

AII-CCAA First Team, the 12-per-
son All-Pacific Region Team and 
the six-person Daktronics Pacific 
Region All-Star Second Team. 
Those voted to the Dalctronics 
Pacific Region All-Star Teams 
include players in CCAA, Great 
Northwest Athletic Conference 
and Pacific Wesr Conference. 

Ohta, our of Whimey High 
School in Cypress, Calif., averaged 
12.93 assists per game, which was 
second in CCAA, and she has con-
sisrently ranked in the top three in 
this care gory for CCAA in the past 
three seasons. Ohta had 1,345 
assists for the 2003 season, making 
it 3,420 career-total assists in her 
284 games for UCSD. She also led 
the team in digs last year and con-
tributed her best ever 300 digs in 
the 2003 season, placing her third 
on the team in digs-per-game with 
2.88. 

"[Ohta's honors] are all very 
well deserved," UCSD women's 
volleyball head coach Duncan 
McFarland said. "She's our team 
captain and a great leader. She 
deserved the honors for the adver-
sity she faced during the season." 

According to McFarland, Ohta 
suffered from a sore wrist during 
the season and played with pain. 
Although she was unable to get an 
accurate diagnosis for her wrist and 
received conflicting advice about 
what to do (including casting it and

quitting or just playing with pain), 
she opted to tape it up and play, 
leading her team to their 25-5 
overall record, including a No. 1 
ranlc:ing for the majority of the sea-
son. 

Injury did not seem to stop 
Ohta's teammates either, as junior 
outside hitter Bonnie Wilson was 
voted in the All-CCAA First Team. 
A fractured bone sidelined Wilson 
for two weeks during the season. 
Wilson, out of Campolindo High 
School in Moraga, Calif., is a 
Division I transfer out of 
University of New Hampshire. She 
also received honors in her first 
year with UCSD in the 2002 sea-
son, including All-CCAA First 
Team, First Team All-Pacific 
Region selection and the Tritons' 
Most Valuable Player. Her team-
leading 4.22 kills-per-game and 
2.69 digs-per-game averages were 
enough for her First Team selec-
tion. 

"Similar to Teresa, Wtlson was 
focused and played no less than 100 
percent," McFarland said. "I had to 
physically pull her off the coun 
when she was injured because [she 
wanted to keep playing] despite her 
limping around." 

Although she missed regular 
season matches, Wilson was a solid 
player for UCSD, contributing 274 
kills in 65 games this season. 

Joining Ohta and Wilson on the 
A11-CCAA First Team is junior 

middle blocker Kendra Canape. 
Canape, out of Brea Olinda High 
School in Brea, Calif., led UCSD 
in hitting percentage with .386 and 
blocks with 1.19 per game. These 
numbers also consistently ranlced 
her in the top five in CCAA during 
the season. Canape had team-high 
123 blocks in 103 games for the 
2003 season. 

"Kendra is a multi-span player. 
She came here having played bas-
ketball, high jump in track and vol-
leyball in high school," McFarland 
said. "She has really come into her 

" [Ohta] deserved the 
honors far the adversity 

she faced during the 
season. "

women's vo11eybaii head coach 

own as a player this year. This sea-
son has helped her gain experience 
and develop as a middle blocker. " 

Garnering All-CCAA Second 
Team honors are sophomore out-
side hiner Lindsay Crandell, junior 
outside hitter Stacy Dunsmore and 
junior middle blocker Katie 
Hogan. 

Crandell; out of South Torrance 
High School in Torrance, Calif., is 
a transfer from Eastern 
Washington University who made 
the All-Tournament Team at the 
2002 Big SIcy Championship. The 
sophomore made her debut with 
the Tritons in 86 games this season, 
contributing 306 kills (3 .561c:i11s per 
game) and 191 digs (2.22 digs per 
game). 

"Lindsay was not playing much 
at the beginning," McFarland said. 
"But she was detennined at getting 
play time. She is unique because 
she played as an outside hitter and 
an opposite. She's a versatile player 
who would do anything we asked 
her to. She's a good jumper -
explosive and quick - and surpris-
ingly one of our best hiners and a 
good blocker for being only [5 feet, 
9 inches.]" 

Dunsmore received her second 
AII-CCAA Second Team honors of 
the season and her first All-Pacific 
Honorable Mention. She averaged 
3.18 kills-per-game totaling to 302 
kills in 95 games played, including 
300 digs to average for 3.16 each 
game. 

"Stacy is our steadiest player, 
effective in hi tting and at the net," 
McFarland- said. "She is a solid 
blocker, a good server and serve 
receive player. She had the best 
defense and no injuries during the 
season." 

Rounding out the honors is 

Hogan from Archbishop Mitty 
High School in San Jose, Calif., 
selected to the AlI-CCAA Second 
Team for the second year in a row. 
In 104 games, Hogan added 275 
kills, averaging 2.64 IciJls-per-game 
with a .344 hitting percentage. She 
was second on the team in blocks 
with 101, averaging 0.97 per game. 

"Similar to Kendra, Katie was 
not very polished when she first 
played here," McFarland said. 
"She has gonen better each year 
and has steadily improved. 
Although she is quite small for a 
middle blocker [at 5 feet, 10 inch-
es], she is a good jumper and 
makes up for her shoner height 
with her quickness." 

For the 2003 season, UCSD 
finished 25-5 overall and 19-3 in 
the CCM, including a second 
place finish behind Cal State San 
Bernardino. Their successful sea-
son included a first time No. 1 
ranking in the NCAA Division II 
poll that they held for eight of the 
13 weelcs the poll was released dur-
ing the season. The Tritons hosted 
the Division II Pacific Regional for 
the First time and suffered defeat 
from Hawaii Pacific in five games. 
UCSD finished off the year with a 
final No.6 ranlcing in the AVCA 
poll . University of North Alabama 
took the NCAA Division II nation-
al crown on Dec. 6 over 
Concordia-St.Paul in San 
Bernardino, Calif.

Tritons were tlat in the 56-46 loss. 
The Coyotes moved to 5-6 overall 
and 2-4 in league play with the win. 

"The night before took a lot out 
of us," Ginn said. "It wasn't our 
night" 

The Tritons were aCTUally close 
throughout most of the first half, 
but a surge by Cal State San 
Bernardino gave them a 10 point 
lead going into halftime. 

Unlike the previous night, 
UCSD was not able to respond in 
the second half. They never seemed 
to establish a rhythm on offense, and 
the result was their lowest offensive 
output of the season. 

"We couldn't buy a bucket to 

save our lives," Ginn said . 
"Nothing was going in."

No player on UCSD scored in 

double digits. Ginn led the Tritons 
with nine points and Stacy 
Gallagher-Bolton had a team-high 
nine rebounds. The team also 
struggled from the free-throw line, 
as they managed only 50 percent. 

Rebounding hurt the Tritons 
again, as they were outrebounded 
47-40 by Cal State San Bernardino. 
The Tritons have lost all three 
games in which they have been out-
rebounded. 

1be Tritons will look t9 get bacIc 
on the right traclc as they complete 
their homestand with-games against

moving to Division II. This is a dif-
ferent basketball team than the one 
that played opening night, 
Lanthier said, and they have come 
out and played inspired and gutsy 
basketball. 

"1lhe difference has been our 
preparation," Lanthier said. "We 
have made the commitment as a 
team after the holiday break to 
practice and prepare hard for 
games so we can play up to our 
capabilities. " 

This game marked the begin-
ning of a four-game homestand for 
the Tritons. 

"We have proven we can win 
on the road, but it is a definite 

advantage for us to be playing at 
home," Lanthier said. 

However, playing at home did 
not help the Tritons the next night, 
when they lost to defending CCAA 
champions Cal State San 
Bernardino. The Tritons had kept 
up with the Coyotes, posting eight 
three-point baskets and tying them 
at halftime. But UCSD fell in the 
second half, committing eight 
turnovers and allowing Cal State 
San Bernardino to have 13-0 and 
7 -0 scoring runs to secure their 
double-digit victory. 

The Coyotes' had four players 
reach double digits in scoring with 
Eric Swan's game-leading 18 
points, Jonathan Levy and Dumas 

Martin's 16 points apiece and T.K 
Reed's 11 points. 

UCSD managed to have two 
players score in double figures, 
junior forward Brandon Francis, 
who contributed 12 points, and 
red-shin freshman forward Adam 
Reinking, who tallied II points and 
added a team-high seven rebounds. 

With the win, the Coyotes 
improve to 10-1 overall and 6-0 in 
the CeM, placing them first in 
the conference. 

The Tritons return to action at 
home next weekend on Jan. 16 and 
Jan. 17 when they host UC Davis 
and Chico State, respectively. lip-
off for both games is at 7:30 p.m. at 
RIMAC arena.

Men's volleyball secu'res 
first victory ' of the season 

By BRYCE WARWICK 
Senior Staff Writer 

Afrer a sluggish start in its 
2004 campaign, the UCSD men's 
volleyball team rebounded to win, 
3-1, over visiting Quincy 
University (111.), sening the stage 
for what the Tritons hope will be 
a strong year. 

UCSD returns four starters 
from last year's 6-22 squad that fin-
ished 1-2 J in the Mountain Pacific 
Sports Federation. Despite the 
unimpressive record, the Tritons 
were ranked for one week in the 
American Volleyball Coaches 
Association's Top 15, which 
includes both Division I and 
Division II schools. 

On top of UCSD's very diffi-
cui r conference schedule, Triton 
head coach Ron Larsen has also 
scheduled defending national 
champion Lewis University and 
Penn State, who finished last sea-
son at No. 6. 

The key position for this year's 
Triton team will be setter. The 
graduation of Eric Perrine, who 
led last year's squad, will place the 
responsibility of guiding the 
offense on junior Nate Jones, 
although highly touted freshman 
Brooks Dierdorff may ger a shot. 
The offensive weapons the setters 
will have at their disposal include 
2003 kill leader, senior Jim Waller, 
who averaged 4.84 kills per game 
from his opposite position - good 
for Fifth in the nation. Junior out-
side hitter Adam Toren also 
returns 'for the Tritons after a 
strong 2003 campaign in which he 
averaged 2.49 kills per game. The 
other outside hitter is sophomore 
Jeff Urton, who started II march-
es last season and will be asked to 
contribute even more in 2004. 

;L e~,: tI 
.. 'TNT' 115Ft, 

..... 

Senior middle hitters Kevin 
Keyser and Andy Rupp will anchor 
the Triton block, and could be 
valuable offensive weapons if 
UCSD passes well enough to run 
plays out of the middle. The 
Triton libero is junior Dickens 
Tai, a crowd favorite who routine-
ly makes spectacular defensive 
plays, and at only 5 feet, 6 inches 
is nearly a foot and a half shorter 
than the tallest player on the court 
at times. 

UCSD did not start the match 
well. Quincy showed their regular 
season poise, while the Tritons 
struggled to move the ball. As a 
result, Quincy hit .391 to UCSD's 
. 179 in game one, and the Hawks 
rolled,30-23. 

UCSD showed far more com-
posure in game two as the Tritons 
bad 15 kills with JUSt twO errors to 
overwhelm the Hawks 30-21, and 
even the match at a game apiece. 
Game three was tighter, with mis-
takes by both sides, but in the end 
UCSD prevailed, 30-27. Play 
became slightly sloppier in game 
four, but the Tritons closed out the 
match 30-22 for a season-opening 
victory, while the Hawks dropped 
to 0-3. 

After seeing his team play, 
Larsen's hopes for the season 
stayed optimistic, and he feels that 
when several of his bench players 
recover from siclc:ness or injury, 
his team will be even stronger. 

"Our expectations are high," 
Larsen said. "We have a person off 
the bench at every Spot who can 
come out and play, and there's not 
going to be much or any drop-
off."

Teresa Ohta's selection to the 
Fi rst Team All-America by the

the Un.iversity of Tampa, who are 
both now four-time AlI -

Ohta adds her First Team AlI-

The UCSD swimming and div-
ing team fell to the University of 
Utah, a NCAA Division I team, on 
Jan. 10. T he women's meet ended 
with a score of 153-139 and the 
men's was finalized at 168-130. 
Each UCSD squad had only two 
event wins. 

On the women's side, senior 
co-captain Carolyn Kwok, fresh-
man Liz Whiteley, junior Rosanna 
Delurgio and freshman Emily 
Harlan beat out Utah's 200-yard 
freestyle relay teams, finishing in 1 
minute, 37.78 seconds to keep 
UCSD undefeated in that event. 

Harlan had the other triumph 
for the women in the 50-yard 
freestyle (24.44). 

The UCSD women were at a 
disadvantage because NCAA cham-

pion Rosanna Delurgio could not 
swim her best events, the lOO-yard 
and 2oo-yard breaststroke. Nursing 
a knee injury, she swam only 
freestyle. Although it is not her pri-
mary stroke, she had a strong per-
formance in the 200, coming in sec-
ond with a time of 1:57.63. 

Delurgio's injury is not serious, 
and according to head coach Scott 
McGihon, she should be healthy 
by next weekend. 

Senior Denise Bogard, another 
powerful UCSD breaststroker, 
placed second in the 100-yard 
breaststroke in 1:05 .80, her best 
t ime this season. Bogard took 
another second in the 200-yard 
individual medley (2 : 12.87). 

Sophomore Sophie Levy earned 
the final second place for the 
UCSD women in the 500-yard 
freestyle. Her time was 5:12.74. 

For the men, the meet against 

Utah was the first against outside 
competition in six weeks. It was 
also the first meet in which John 
Pearce, the men's only individual 
event winner of the day, competed 
with the UCSD team. 

Pearce transferred to UCSD 
last spring from Grossmont 
College. Though he was a good 
swimmer at the junior college 
level, he chose not to swim at 
UCSD until this quarter. 

In the closest race of the day, 
Pearce beat Utah's Eric Jorgenson 
by only four hundredths of a sec-
ond in the SOO-yard freestyle. 
Pearce swam the event in 4:52.08. 

Pearce could prove to be a valu-
able addition for UCSD, especially 
if he matches best times from earli-
er years. Because he has not been 
training with the team throughout

The UCSD women's basketball 
suffered two disappointing set-
backs this weekend. The Tritons 
fell 84-81 to Cal Poly Pomona on 
Jan. 9 and 56-46 on the following 
evening at RIMAC Arena. With 
the losses, UCSD dropped to 7-4 
overall and 3-3 in the Galifornia 
Collegiate Athletic Association. 

The Tritons saw two streaks this 
season end on the first of the two 
back-to-back weekend games. 
Their six-game winning streak, the 
team's longest in four seasons, was 
snapped as Cal Poly Pomona edged 
the Tritons in an exciting game. It 
also marked the first time this sea-
son that the Tritons have lost at 
home. With the victory, the 
Bronco improved to 8-2 overall 
with a 4-1 league record. 

Cal Poly Pomona got off to a 
good start and controlled play in the 
first half. Their full-court press dis-
rupted the flow of the Triton 
offense. 

"They pressed, and we got into 
their game," sepior captain Ali 
Ginn said. "And they're too good 
of athletes for that." 

The Broncos continued the 
press throug:lOut the first half and 
took a 48-37 lead into the locker 
room. 

UCSD came out in the second 
half and started to cut into the lead, 
as Cal Poly Pomona discontinued 
its full court press. With five min-
utes left, red-shirt freshman guard 

Kim Buffum hit an important 
three-pointer to pull UCSD within 
three. They could not manage to 
catch the Bronocs, however, and 
freshman guard Leora Juster's half-
court shot at the buzzer to tie just 
missed. 

"We played our game more in 
the second half," Ginn said. "I'm 
confident about the next time we 
play them." 

Ginn also commented on 
Juster's performance. 

"Her shot looked good out of 
her hands, it just didn't fall. 
Otherwise, she had a good game," 
Ginn said. 

Juster finished with a team-high 
22 points to go along with five 
assists. Junior forward Katie 
McGann and Buffum had 14 and 13 
points, respectively. Junior center 
MargaretJobnson added nine points 
while pulling down 10 rebounds. 

Candice Allen, a transfer out of 
Division I University of Arizona, 
led the Broncos, scoring 28 points 
and pulling down five rebounds 
while Keila Beachem contributed 
26 points and 11 boards. 

This was only the second game 
that UCSD was outrebounded. 
The other came in a loss during the 
first game of the season. The 
Tritons managed 41 rebounds to 
Cal Poly Pomona's 49. . 

The Tritons took the floor again 
on Jan. 10 against Cal State San 
Bernardino. The emotion of the 
previous night took its toll, as the

The Tritons pulled off an upset 
on Jan. 9 by beating Cal Poly 
Pomona in a thrilling game, 65-64, 
at RIMAC Arena. On the following 
night on the same floor, however, 
the UCSD . men's basketball team 
fell 75-56 to Cal State San 
Bernardino. 

Cal Poly Pomona was ranked 
fifth in the country to start the sea-
son at the Division IT level and a 
favorite to win the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
crown. 

Playing in front of an enthusias-
tic UCSD crowd at RIMAC Arena, 
the Tritons found a way to hang on 
for the victory. The Tritons led by 
as many as 12 points late in the sec-
ond half, but the Broncos refused 
to go out without a fight, almost 
overcoming an eight-point Triton 
lead with just 51 seconds remaining 
in the game. The Tritons missed 
two free throws with 1.8 seconds 
remaining, but the ball was tipped 
on the rebound attempt causing the 
clock to expire and preserving the 
Triton victory. 

. After the g~me, a fired up 
UCSD men's basketball head coach 
Greg Lanthier was happy to escape 
with a big win. 

"We're young, and we will take 
it any w~y we can," Lanthier said. 

The Tritons were led by a solid 
performance from sophomore 
guard Matthew Sweany who had 19 
points. Sweany shot 6-of-l0 from 
the floor and went 5-of-6 from the 
free throw line. While Sweany had 
his outside stroke going, junior

forward Adam Reinking drives to the net 
center Jesse Boyd dominated the 
paint, scoring 14 points on 7-of-12 
shooting and collected eight big 
rebounds. However, this game was 
a total team effort as the Tritons 
played gritty basketball against a 
tough team. 

"We've got players," Lanthier 
said. "We have guys that can flat 
out play!" 

Jeff Bonds led Cal Poly 
Pomona with a team-high 19 
points and eight rebounds. He was 
the lone double-digit scorer for the 
Broncos. 

UCSD's third win in a row 
improved its record to 4-6 overall, 
4-1 in the CCM, marking by far 
the Tritons best-ever start since
