Rallies to 
Save Patient 
CHARITY: Mar hall 
sophomore diagnosed 
with a tumor la t year 
By MAn SCHRADER 
Staff Writer 

Coldstone Creamery and the 
Marshall Student ouncil have 
joined together to raise funds 
Monday night from 6 p.m. to 10 
p.m. for Marshall sophomore 
Du tin Demont, who is uffering 
from a brain tumor. 

"This is a good cause, even 
more than o thers, because it 
relates to every tudent on this 
ca mpus, " Marshall sophomore 
John Bwarie said . "And when it 
does, we as a universi ty, need to 
come together and lend a hand." 

Bwa rie said Coldstone has 
agreed to donate 25 percent of all 
the of Monday night's revenue to 
Demont and his family. 

Friends of Demont say tha t 
while he appears physica lly well, 
he has no short-term memory. 

Last November, d<><;tors diag-
nosed Demont wi th a brain 
tumor. As a resul t of his illness, 
Demont spent app roximately one 
month living and receiving treat-
ment a t Scripps Hospital loca ted 
on the UCSD ca mpus. 

As doctors were uncertain 
about the severity of Demont's sit-
uation, they placed a hunt into his 
brain to drain away any e cess 
f1Ul(:l, in his brain. 

Friends of Demont said hIS ill -
ness appeared so suddenly, they 
did not have a chance to praces 
their emotions. 

"There was no warning or 
time to be sad in this situation," 
saId Lucas Ladd, Demont's room-
mate last yea r. "He was struck 
down in the prime of his life." 

According to Bwa rie, one of

McCain said. "It's all about 
reforming our party and refoon-

McCain said that his candida-
cy for president runs on the ban·

"I want to be president so I 
can reform the military," he said. 
"I want to reform education so 
that every American in America 
has the same ability that wealthy 
parents do, and that is to send 
your child to the school of your 

choice in your neighborhood. I 
want to reform the tax code, 
which is 44,000 pages long - a 
good deal for special interests, 
but a nightmare and a chamber 
of horrors for average citizens." 

McCain said these reforms 
cannot take place until special

CANCER: 
More surgeries will 
not help recovery 
ContInued from ...,. 1 
the saddening effects of this story 
is that the possibility of develop-
ing a brain tumor is a reality for 
everyone. 

"There is no way of knowing 
that something terrible like this is 
going to happen," he said. "This 
could happen to any of us." 

Ladd said he agrees with these 
sentiments of uncertainty in life 
and has applied them to his life. 

"He has gone from being per-
feetly healthy two weeks ago to 
being in a semi-coma," he said. 
.. ou never know when it is 
going to be your time." 

Once the e cess nuid was 
removed, doctor determ ined 
that Demont's brain tumor was 
benign and that more surgeries 
woufd not help his recovery. 

Bwarie said Demont has 
begun his trea tment to repair his 
life. 

" He goes to physical therapy, 
speech therapy, occupat ional 
therapy, and even family therapy 
so that he can learn to live w ith 
his circumstances for now," he 
said. " He has very little short 
term memory, right now [as] he 
often forgets something he just 
did two minutes prior." 

Starting last week, Demont 
started radia tion therapy five 
days a week in Sacramento, Callf. 
that wlil last another five weeks. 
Although the insurance company 
pays for this procedure, Demont 
and his family must pay for their 

housing each night, as their 
hometown in Truckee, Calif. is 
approximately 100 miles away. 

In addition, Demont requires 
a new pieee of equipment that 
costs $2,500. His insurance will 
not cover the cost due to a techni-
cality. 

To aid in these costs, the 
Marshall Student Council has 
organized fund raisers this quar-
ter such as a canned food drive, a 
bake sale, and now Monday's ice 
cream sale. 

" People should go because the 
more people that go to 
Coldstone, the more money we 
will be able to raise for him," 
Bwarie said. " If we can reach the 
goal of $2,500 by the end of the 
night, the family will be able to 
see the amount before the week's 
end." 

Currently, the Marshall 
Student Council has raised over 
$1,900 for Demont's cause. 

" I can' t express how grateful I 
am for any company who decides 
to take this on and raise money 
for this cause," Ladd said. " If you 
only knew Dustin you would 
realize he is such a great guy and 
that for him to receive this sup-
port is inspiring. This represents 
a great opportunity to make 
some money and help a good 
cause." 

Bwarie added that it is impor-
tant for all students to participate 
in this fundraiser. 

" We as a univer ity should be 
able to help other members of our 
community who need our help, 
whether it be financially, physical-
ly, or spiritually," Bwarie said. " I 
hope everyone goes to Colds tone 
and supports the Demont family."

4 OPINION The UCSD Guardian Monday. February 28. 2000 

PINION 

COMMENTARY: Advocates of the Confederate flag claim 
they are protecting their heritage, yet send a racist message 

B, SIMONE SANTINI 
Senior Staff Writer 

deserves our respect and should be care-
fully considered even by people like me 
who think that it should be rejected. 

A national flag is a special kind of sym-
bol : It is a political one. When foreign pro-
testers burn the U.S. flag, the protest is 
always directed toward some political 
decision taken by the government of the 
United States, or against the government 
of the United States itself. Flag burning is 
a form of protest against the United States 

Recently, the federal government has 
been pressuring a few Southern states to 
remove Confederate symbols from their 
public buildings and official documents. 
The case that has received the most pub-
licity is the Confederate flag, which is still 
flying over the capitol of South Carolina, 
although this is not the only case. The 
Confederate flag also flies 
(if only metaphorically) in III ..... ~ .. _ 
the Georgia state seal. 

as a political entity (con-
sequently, the legitimacy 
of a flag as a political sym-
bol is the reason we 
should reject prohibitions 
of flag burning). 

Two factions formed 
almost immediately on 
the subject. Some say 
decisions to display 
Confederate flags go 
against the common 
American heritage and 
that the federal govern-
ment has a civic duty to 
make the official symbols 
of the government com-
mon to all Americans. 

The other faction maintains that an 
intervention like this goes well beyond the 
constitutional mandate of the government 
and represents an unacceptable interfer-
ence in state sovereignty. Such qUibbles 
are unavoidable in a federal state, where a 
number of different, sometimes opposing, 
governing bodies work to strike a precari-
ous balance. 

Sometimes this precarious balance 
might even include tolerating the display 
of what is, technically, the flag of a once-
independent country that waged war 
against the United States (it is amusing, 
however, to imagine the public reaction to 
the idea of a Mexican flag flying over the 
capitol in Sacramento). 

A flag is not just a piece of cloth, but a 
symbol of identity for a group of people. 
As such, the argument advanced by many 
southerners is that the Confederate flag is

One doesn't see pro-
testers burning American 
flags as a protest against 
the overbearing presence 
of Hollywood movies in 
foreign markets . 
Although Hollywood is 
one of the trademarks of 

American culture - for better or worse-
burning a flag would be inappropriate. A 
flag is a political symbol, not a culturat 
one. 

In the case of the Confederate flag, this 
political significance is reinforced by the 
particular place where the flag is dis-
played: the capitol. Flying the flag above 
the capitol reinforces our perception of it 
as a political symbol of the state for which 
it stood. It is a slave-driven, rurallatiforrdo, 
a relic of the middle ages in 19th century 
America and the ultimate assertion that 
the economic structure of a state is the 
only arbiter of its ethics. A number of 
beliefs. that, hopefully, all of us have final-
ly committed to history's dustbin. 

While a private display of the 
Confederate flag can be reasonably inter-
preted as an affirmation of a historical her-
itag", the official nature of the building on

White House Curse Will Bring Tragedy to the Next President 
COMMENTARY: Every president since William Harrison elected in a year ending in zero has died or nearly died in office 
Iy KEVIN SEID 
Senior Staff Writer 

The arrival of the year 2000 
means that America will once 
again be besieged by another 
presidential election. While I am 
sure you all have a favorite candi-
date you will be voting for in the 
upcoming election, I am reluctant 
to cast any vote. This reluctance 
stems from an interesting piece of 
presidential trivia I read when I 
was about seven years old. I am 
now afraid that whoever wins 
this election will suffer almost 
certain doom after becoming 
president. 

It is called the White House 
Curse. Beginning with William 
Henry Harriso.n, every p.resident 
who has won III an electIon year 
ending with a zero has died or 
nearly died while in office. My 
theory is that the winner of the 
2000 preSidentia l election will 
also suffer from the curse. 

You may be thinking that this 

curse idea is really outrageous 
and superstitious, but it is not 
based on mere coincidence. 
These events actually occurred, 
proving that th.ere is something 
truly eerie and mysteriOUS is 
going on. 

Erected in 1840, Harrison 
became the first victim of the 
curse. Coincidentally, he was also 
the first U.S. president to ever die 
in office. On a blustery day, he 
gave a two-hour inauguration 
speech while standing in the rain. 
Unfortunately, he wasn't wearing 
a coat or hat and so he contracted 
a cold. It eventually developed 
into pneumonia and Harrison 
died a month later from the ill-
ness. Of all the American presi-
dents, Harrison had the shortest 
tenure. 

The next victim of the curse 
was Abraham Lincoln, who was 
elected in 1860. You undoubtedly 
know about the demise of the 
president who led the union 
through the Civil War. While 

attending a performance at Ford's 
Theater, an unhappy southerner 
named John Wilkes Booth crept 
into the preSidential box and 
killed Lincoln by shooting him in 
the back of the head. 

The 1880 election gave the 
presidency to James A. Garfield. 
On July 2, 1881, a few months into 
his term, an embittered attorney 
named Charles Guiteau shot 
Garfield as he was waiting for a 
train at the Washington .Rail 
Depot. The mentally unbalanced 
Guiteau was extremely outraged 
that his application to be the U.S. 
ambassador to France had been 
denied. 

Mortally wounded by the 
bullet that lodged inside his 
chest, Garfield was rushed to the 
White House. Due to the med-
ical technology of the time, the 
only way doctors could find the 
bullet was a manual probe. 
Unfortunately, they were never 
able to find it. Even Alexander 
Graham Bell tried to locate it 

using an induction-balance elec-
tronic device he designed. 
Finally, on Sept. 6, Garfield was 
taken to the New Jersey seaside 
where he died 13 days later from 
an infection. 

William McKinley was elected 
to his second term in 1900. His 
first term was dominated by for-
eign affairs, including leading the 
country to victory in the Spanish-
American War. On Sept. 6, 1901, 
he was shot during a reception at 
the Buffalo Pan-American 
Exposition. The president was 
standing in a receiving line and 
shaking hands when an anarchist 
named Leon Czolgosz shot him 
twice with a revolver he had hid-
den under a handkerchief folded 
around his hand meant to look 
like it covered a wound. 
McKinley died a few days later 
from the wounds. 

Warren G. Harding, the next 
victim of the curse, was elected to 
the office in 1920. He was as scan-
dalous a president as Bill Clinton. 

In the infamous Teapot Dome 
Scandal, Harding's cabinet mem-
bers exploited naval oil reserves 
for their own financial gain. 
Hatding had a number of extra-
marital affairs and even allegedly 
had an illegitimate child . On 
Aug. 2, 1923, he died of a heart 
attack. His death was followed by 
wild conspiracy theories, as were 
the deaths of Lincoln and 
Kennedy. He was suffering from 
heart problems prior to his death, 
but!rumors circulated that he poi-
soned himself or was poisoned by 
his wife. 

The election of 1940 saw 
Franklin D. Roosevelt win an 
unprecedented third term in 
office. The president who carried 
the country through the Great 
Depression and World War II also 
won an unprecedented fourth 
term in 1944. However, FDR's 
health was deteriorating quickly 
as the war drew to a close. He

Editorial ESpoused Personal Attack ~ithout Any Valid Criticism 
Editor: 

The Feb. 24 issue of the 
Guardian tackled some hard-hit-
ting issues - Ethiopia's crisis, the 
UC TAs' strike, and my hair color 
(" A.S. Council Is Slowly Killing 
UCSD's Alternative Media"). 

I am Bobby Kim, your A. S. 
commissioner of communica-
tions. After three weeks of wit-
nessing my name being smeared 
campuswide, attempting to 
ignore it and seeing it smeared 
some more, I have finally decid-
ed to shed some light on the sub-
ject. 

Throughout the past several 
years, UCSD's alternative media 
has been on a rapid decline. 

My first point is this - the past 
few commissioners of communi-
cations have left this office with 
the same grim result as I have 
been dealing with. So, why sud-
denly pick on one individual for 
a half decade's worth of prob-
lems? -

So, if the Notorious B.O.B. is 
not responsible for "slowly 
killing UCSD's alternative 
media," who did it? 

Well, it was not Colonel 
Mustard with the wrench in the 
pantry. Serona point to consider: 
Maybe the alternative media is 
responsible for their own demise. 
If anyone is apathetic, it would be 
the producers of most, but not all, 
of these publicatiOns. 

Of the roughly 10 alternative 
media organizations, a mere 
three have made some form of 
effort to form a relationship with 
the A.S. Council. I have attempt-
ed to schedule meetings with 
each editor to discuss his or her 
new budget, and only one has 
responded. 

A few publications did not 
produce a single issue last quar-

ter. I have held office hours two 
times a week since my term 
began and I have had less than 10 
visits; most are from the same 
individuals! 

Now, many may be wonder-
ing about my "apathy" toward 
~the media's decline. Ask Gach 

Noi, The Kotllll and VOl Fronttriza if 
I am apathetic after I managed to 
get them a well-deserved addi-
tional $2000 for their winter quar-
ter budgets. 

Now that I have established 
some hard truths, I will move on 
to the final point. Both the Feb. 3 
and Feb. 24 issues misrepresented 
my statements, printing them out 
of context to form the GUllrdilm's 
own fantastic arguments. 

In II A.S. Cuts Media 
Funding," the GUllrdian omitted 
half of my quotes (many dealing 
with how The KoIllll is a "good" 
publication "punished" for the 
apathy of a few ''bad'' publica-
tions) to construct a story that 
seemed as if I were against The 
Koalll and alternative media - the 
very thing I am in office for. 

Does that make any sense? 
The GUllrdian should back its sto-
ries with hard facts and reliable, 
informed sources, instead of 
"sources from the A.S. Council." 
Sources close to the Guardian tell 
me its editors have opposable 
thumbs. 

Many readers are probably 
asking, "What does Kim know 
about journalism?" 

The Guardian's past three arti-
cles have been simple assump-
tion..s about my job and judg-
ments about myself. Has anyone 
from the editorial board attempt-
ed to contact me about what it has 
heard? No. Instead, it chose to 
comment on my appearance and 
my "paltry representation and

impotent leadership." 
What? These are character 

judgments concerning my per-
sonality, not the amount of work I 
have invested in my office this 
year. By the way, I am not impo-
tent. 

I fail to see what the Guardiall 
is attempting to accomplish in 
trus Anti-Bobby Kim campaign. 
As far as I can tell, this is person-
al. The GUllrdian has miscon-
strued my statements in three 
recent issues in an attempt to 
make me appear inefficient, 
printed an editorial of assump-
tions and character judgments in 
an attempt to make me look like a 
bad person and even spent a 
paragraph discussing my hair. 

If the GUllrdian focused on the 
business I conduct, backed with 
irrefutable research, I would not 
be writing this letter. Instead,

Let's Just Get Rid of 
Athlet .. Altogether 
Editor: 

In response to pre-registration 
for athletes: 

Who needs athletes? Who 
cares how much time and energy 
they put into their sports? UCSD 
offers no athletic scholarships, no 
benefits, which means student 
athletes play purely for love of 
their game - so by all means, 
let's not ruin that by giving them 
the perk of early registration! • 

Let's just continue the UCSD 
tradition of not attending any ath-
letic games and ignoring any 
championships the team bring 
home. Maybe then all the athletes 
at our prestigious university will 
realize that college is all about 

classes and studying; collegiate 
athletics just promote 5(.'hool dis-
unity and fragmentation . 

God, when are universities 
like Stanford, UCLA and Cil l 
going to get the picture? Don't 
they realize how much better 
their schools would be if they 
took away all their athletic pro-
grams? I mean, it ' s obvious 
UCSD doesn' t need any more 
social cohesiveness; school pride 
just jumps out at you when you 
walk onto the campus! 

For God's sake, don' t give ath-
letes pre-registration benefits! 
Then students might realize that 
athletes do actually exist on cam-
pus - athletes and sports teams 
and competitions at UCSD? This 
is too much, I need to get back to 
studying .. . in the library of 
course.

Where Is the Reds' 
Training Facility? 
Editor: 

In Brian Welles' clrticle 
"Cincinnati Is Center Stage of 
Media Circus," (Feb. 24) he writes 
about Ken Griffey Jr.'s debut as a 
Cincinnati Red. He writes about 
Griffey's first workout and media 
interview in the Reds' spring 
training facility in Cincinnati and 
goes on about the press in the 
Midwest and the region's overall 
reaction to the trade. 

However, the Reds' spring 
training facility is not in 
Cincinnati, but in Sarasota, Fla. 
This ruins one of the central argu-
ments being made in the article. It 
is disappointing to see that the 
Guardiall sports staff continues to 
write articles on false facts.

The Confederate flag was

It is true that we can not

at best and the most crass revi-

Politically, the Confederate

Do You AGREE WITH MICHAEL? 
WHO IS MICHAEL? 

My nome is Michael Carley. This is my four1h year studying Microbiology 
here at UCSD. I grew up in a family of 5 and learned about God 
through my family and the church that my parents took us to. When I 
arrived at UCSD I challenged my faith. I challenged It Intellectually, 
spiritually, emotionally and scientifically. I wonted to know the truth. I 
wonted to know if the God of the bible wal the creator of the . 
universe. I wonted to know if what lesus said In 
lohn 14:6, HI am the way, the truth and the life: 
was really vatid. I presented these challenges to 
God by studying the Bible and examining other 
religions. The more I have studied the more I 
have learned that my faith is built on truth and 
not on feelings or emotions or blind faith. I have 
come to realize that the bible and Christianity 
speak about how we as individual humans can 
have a loving relationship with the creator. God answered my call 
and truly responded as he said he would in Matthew 7:7, "seek and 
you will fi nd." I searched and I questioned and I asked, "What is so 
important about Jesus Christ and his death on the cross?" I studied 
the bible and the verse that says; "God demonstrates his own love 
toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us". 
Romans 5:8. This verse has the word "sinners" which sounded like 

WHAT DOES MICHAEL BELIEVE? 

religious jargon to me. So I studied the word and learned that the word 
sin just means not being perfect, doing thing. you know aren't the belt 
to be doing. I also asked the question, why do w. need someone to die 
for us. Christ died for us because, "It Ie wages for ain Is death." Romans 
6:23. This verse explains how the penalty for our imperfections is 
spiritual separation from God through death. I don't wont to be sepa-

rated from God for eternity and I realized that God 
doesn't wont us separated from him either. "for God did 
not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, 
but to save the world through him." John 3:17 "If you 
confess with your mouth lesus i. Lard, and believe in 
your heart that God raised him from the dead, you shall 
be saved." Romans 10:9 The more I learn about God the 
more I learn about his love for us. I want you to experi-
ence his love by trusting in him as your personal savior. 

I invite you to ask questions, ask who is Jesus Christ, why did he die 
on the cross and whot relevance does he have to my life. Ask your 
christian friends, "how do you know God is real?" Ask them why they 
are a christian. Ask God to reveal himself to you. God promises that he 
will. "I sought the lord, and he answered me; he delivered me from all 
my fears." 

! Psalm 34 :4 

We bel ieve that there is only one true God. He is perfect, He loves us, and wonts to have a personal relationship with us. Due to our imperfection, 
we are separated from Him. To free us from the sin that makes us imperfect, God sent His son, Jesus Christ, to earth. Jesus overcame human limita-
tions a nd lived a blomeless life. He died on a cros.s, as a sacrifice for our sin, and then rose from the dead . Therefore our sin is no longer a barrier 
between God and us. The only way to know God and to have a personal relationship with Him is to accept Jesus as our savior by faith . 

Through Jesus, it is possible for us to have eternollife in heaven as well as a meaningful life on earth.

BERKELEY, Calif. - An

judge issued a permanent injunc-
tion Thursday, barring an unau-
thorized note-taking service from 
operating on any University of 
California campus. 

The default judgement, issued 
by Superior Court Judge Ken 
Kawaichi, resulted from the fail-
ure of R&R Corporation to appear 
in court at any point during the 
eight-month lawsuit. The compa-
ny sells lecture notes to students 
without university permission. 

Executive Vice Chancellor and 
Provost Carol Christ, who testi-
fied during the lawsuit, said R&R 
had engaged in several unethical 
business practices. 

In her testimony, Christ said 
heteifile hed ~'cd ftumelQUS

R&R was not represented by 
an ~ttomey in the lawsuit, and no

in court. Attempts to locate the 
company, which had been using a

area, were unsuccessful.

Demonstrators 
Arrested at UCLA 
Law School 

LOS ANGELES - Sixteen 
protesters were arrested at the 
UCLA law school Thursday 
after taking over an office for 
more than five hours, demand-
ing the dean address their con-

, cerns about increasing racial 
diversity. 

Following the "Rally to 
Prevent Resegregation" outside 
the law school that included a 
keynote address from State 
Assembly Speaker Antonio 
Villaraigosa, 16 protesters 
invaded the records office with 
a lawyer and negotiator. 

Some from the audience fol-
lowed the protesters into the 
building and crowded around 
the office chanting phrases such 
as "UC Regents, we see 
racists,"and delivering speech-
es. 

Dean Jonathan Varat, other 
university officials and several 
police officers entered the office 
after the takeover to talk with the 
protesters. 

Varat said that he shared 
many of the goals of the pro-
testers, but did not want to 
accept their demands under 
duress. He also said that he was 
not authorized to accept some 
demands.

CwlI ........... l 
last breath I take," he said. 

In a race that has pitted 
McCain against Texas Governor 
George W. Bush, McCain said 
that Bush has increased spend-
ing by 35 percent in the state of 
Texas, while spending by the 
federal government has only 
increased under Clinton by 20 
percent. 

"My friends, I'm the real fis-
cal conservative in this race," 
McCain said. 

McCain also extended his 
banner of reform to Democrats 
and independents, asking them 
to support his "crusade." 

"Don't be afraid of change; 
come and join us," he said. 

. McCain reached out to the 
veterans and military officers in 
the crowd, saying that it is a 
national disgrace that 12,000 
"proud, brave and young enlist-
ed" families are forced to live on 
food stamps. 

"There will be no food stamp 
Army and Navy when I'm presi-
dent of the United States," he 
said, receiving a rousing cheer 
from the crowd. 

McCain said that the Clinton-

The UCSD Guardian 

Gore adminlItration is the first 
administration in which neither 
the president, secretary of state 
nor the secretary of defense has 
worn the uniform of the U.s. 
military. 

"My friends, I'm fully pre-
pared to be the commander-in-
chief of the armed forces and I'm 
fuUy prepared to be 'the presi-
dent of the United States," 
McCain said. I do not need any 
on-the-job training." 

McCain said that if he is 
elected president, "I will always 
tell you the truth no matter 
what." 

The raUy also featured many 
local politicians who have 
endorsed McCain for president. 

San Diego Mayor Susan 
Golding, and the mayors of 
Poway, La Mesa and Chula Vista 
were in attendance. Two others, 
Rep. Duncan Hunter of EI Cajon 
and former U.S. Senate candi-
date Bruce Herschensohn also 
endorsed McCain. 

Admiral James Stockdale, 
Ross Perot's 1992 running mate, 
appeared on the stage to explain 
why he supports McCain for 
president. 

Stockdale said that after 
McCain was shot down in 
Vietnam, he was taken prisoner 
with two broken arms and a 
broken leg. He said McCain 
was tortured 15 times, spent.. 

four yean in solitary confine-
menhnd spent two years in leg 
irons. 

He said McCain served as a 
priSQner of war with "honorable 
belligerence." 

Stockdale dismissed Bush as 
someone who "just argues end-
lessly about the details of some-
thing that most of us don't give a 
damn about." 

California Secretary of the 
State Bill Jones, who recently 
defected from the Bush camp to 
support McCain, spoke at the 
rally urging Californians to 
spread the message and get out 
and vote on March 7. 

"McCain unites the youth 
and the old, repUblicans and 
democrats," he said. "He's 
someone we can believe in." 

Michael Safford, a San Diego 
resident who is a life-long 
Democrat, said he supports 
McCain. 

"I like him more than the 
other candidates and because he 
tells the truth," Safford said. 

Arizona resident Nick 
Alcouk, however, said McCain is 
known in his home state for 
yelling a lot. 

"In Arizona, the senator is 
known to have a temper," he 
said . "Campaign finance reform 
is not a big deal. ButI'm here to 
learn more on his stance on the 
issues." 

NEWS 7 

Jeff Widdenhofer, a U.S. Navy 
helicopter pilot stationed in 
Coronado, said he supports 
McCain because of his character. 

"The moral deterioration of 
the last eight years by the 
Clinton Administration is harm-
ful to the nation," he said . 
"Character matters, ethics malll!r 
.. . the senator's leadership is 
necessary. The McCain 
Movement is that respect and 
character count." 

Muir junior Noah Greer, the 
chapter chair of CaIPIRG, said 
McCain supports a ban on off-
shore drilling. 

"} shook McCain's hand and 
thanked him for his support of 
the ban on offshore drilling and 
McCain reiterated that he sup-
ports the position of the people," 
Greer said. 

Katy Cotter, campus organiz-
er for CaIPIRG, said while she is 
pleased that McCain supports a 
ban on offshore oil driHing;she 
was disappointed that he d id 
not sign a pledge to ban the 
practice. 

"He d idn' t address the issues 
we wanted," she said, "but we 
still have hope." 

Greer said that CalPIRG will 
hold a press conference at 10 
a. m. Tuesday on Library Walk to

BOGOTA, Colombia 
Officially, peace talks between the 
Colombian government and the 
largest rebel group are stalled, 
with no date set for them to 
resume. Yet just the other day, the 
government's chief negotiator 
boasted that "we have advanced 
further this month than in 40 
years of conflict." 

That apparent paradox is the 
result of an unusual new twist to 
efforts to negotiate an end to a 
civil conflict that has killed 35,ixx> 
Colombians in the last decade. 

- Army troops continue their con-
frontation on the battlefield with 
the leftist Revolutionary Armed 
Forces of Colombia, known by its 
Spanish acronym as FARe. Atthe 
same time, a delegation with rep-
resentatives from each side has 
spent most of February touring 
Europe together. 

The unconventional arrange-
ment has been described by 
Victor G. Rica rdo, the govern-
ment's chief peace negotiator, as 
an effort to build confidence and 
trust between Ihe adversaries 

while "coming to know the mod-
els of friendly countries." 

At each stop along the way,

Bush-McCain Fight 
Strains California GOP 

PASADE A, Calif. - As the 
presidenlial campaign moves to 
the biggest states, George W. Bu h 
and John McCain are battling 
squarely for the biggest prize of 
all: California, whose once-mighty 
Republican Party propelled 
Richard ixon and Ronald 
Reagan to the White House but 
has languished and feuded for 
much o( the 1990 as Presidenl 
Clinton and the Democrats came 
to dominate the stale. 

No Republican presidential 
nominee has won the Golden 

tate since the elder George Bush 
in 1988; the current Democratic 
governor, Gray Davis, swept into 
office with a 2Q.point margin two 
year ago. The Bush-McCain fight 
has opened new fault lines here 
that California Republicans can ill 
afford, and a major subtext of the 
candidates' struggle is who 
would be best eqUipped to regain 
the White House by blocking the 
Democrats from carrying what 
has become a must-win state for 
them in ovember. 

The reality is lhat both men are 
seeking the votes of a California 
Republican Party that is older and

Candidate pushed for

Continued from .... e 1

needs a victory here to resuscita te 
his candidacy. His decision to 
spend precious campaign time 
here, rather than in big states like 
California and New York, which 
vote on March 7, puzzled many 
political professionals. 

Gore, however, refusing to 
concede any ground to his oppo· 
nent, is fighting back. He made 
room ill his schedule for a series 
of events where he highlighted 
his environmenta l record, his 
sllpport for civil rights and his 
endorsement by Gov. Gary Locke 
and the Democratic establish-
ment of Washington state. 

In Sealtle Sunday, Gore high-
lighted the case of a sickly 6-
month-old boy to suppo rt his 
argument that Congress ought to 
pass legislation defining the 
rights of patients frustrated with 
the health care system. 

whiter, and more dominated at the 
grass-roots level by social eonserv' 
atives, than it was in the 1980s, 
when a pragmatic fiscal conser-
vatism reigned. At the same time, 
the state as a whole is younger, 
browner and more politically inde-
pendent than it was a decade ago, 
and its striking economic recovery 
from the severe recession of the 
ea rly '90s has helped make Clinton 
more popular here than in almost 
any other state. 

So far, Bush has consistently 
outpolled McCain by about 2-1 
among Republican voters, nearly 
a third of whom identified them· 
selves as strongly conservative in 
a recent statewide Field Poll, and 
nearly 40 percent of whom 
aligned themselves with the reli-
gious right. A Till/ t-C poll 
released Sa turday had Bush lead-
ing among Republicans 49 per-
cen t to 23 percent. 

McCain has begun running 
television advertisements here 
portraying himself as a "proud 
Reagan Republican," in an effort 
to rally the party' s base.

whose main leader has been 
fighting in the bush for mOle 
than 50 years, about the modem 
world and its ways. 

At the very least, the guerril-
las have been exposed not only 
to European social democracy 
but also to a barrage of criticism 
of their involvement in drug 
trafficking, kidnapping for ran-
som and human rights viola-
tions. The implication is that if 
Europe is ever to view the group 
as an insurgency with legitimate 
political goals, as it did Central 
American guerrillas in the 19805, 
the group must change its 
behavior. 

A few optimists like Leon 
Valencia, a columnist for £1 
Tiempo, the main daily here, have 
even suggested that the ties being 
developed between the two sets 
of negotiators have created an 
opening to international media-

spin. 

For all his insistence that the 
vote was about conditions in this 
state of 2.8 million people, and 
not about the Christian 
Democrats' national woes, 
Ruehe, 57, could not reverse a 
slide accentuated by Kohl's con-
tinuing refusal to obey the law 
and name his donors. 

Reliable projections from 
German television showed the 
Social Democrats gaining 43.3 
percent of the vote, an increase of 
3.5 percent from the last election 
here in 1996, and the Christian 

The result amounted to the 
first concrete confirmation of the 
Christian Democrats' electoral 

plight since the financial scan-
dal broke late last year. It also 
suggested that widespread fears 
that the conservative party might 
disintegrate as Italy's ' Christian 
Democrats did in the 19905 are 
premature. "I averted a catastro-
phe," Ruehe insisted. "The 
Christian Democratic party has at 
east been stabilized." 

A "catastrophe" for the 
Christian Democrats would have 
involved a drop below 30 per-
cent in this state, which has 
changed hands many times since 
World War II and been a useful 
bellwether of party political for-
tunes.

Women's Magazines Turn to 
Sex to Spice Up Sales 

Deeply offended by the sexu-
ally explicit magazine covers 
spreading across newsstands, a 
watchdog group called Morality 
in Media last month lobbied the 
Kroger upermarket chain to 
conceal explicit cover lines like 
this one on Cosmopolitall: "Sex 
Tricks Only Cosmo Would 
Know: 20 Earth-Quakmg Moves 
That Will Make Him Plead for 
Mercy - and Beg for More." 

Among the targeted maga-
zines, besides Cosmopolitan: 
Glamoll r, Mademoiselle a/ld 
Redbook. 

Redbook? The inclusion of the 
member of that 'prim cadre of 
magazines known as the Seven 
Sisters, which are aimed most 
intently at married women with 
children, might come as a sur-
prise to readers who still associate 
it with tuna casserole recipes, diet 
tips and articles about calcium 
supplements, not the "steamy 
sexercises" in the February issue. 

The move shows how the 
world has changed for the 97-
year-old Hearst magazine and 

the heretofore sacrosanct sister-
hood of women's magazines, 
and how they are feeling the 
same pressures that have 
prompted many U.s. consumer 
magazines to heat up frank sex-
ual discussion to spur sales. 

These seven titles, most of 
which were founded a century 
ago - Rtdbook, Lad,es' HOIII/' 
JOl/rnal, Good HOllsekeepillg, 
McCall's, Family Circle, WOI/UW'S 
Day and Better HOllies & Garde/ls 
- have long been known for their 
coverage of domestic subjects like 
child-rearing, recipes, health and 
home decoration. Unlike GII/mollr, 
Cosmopolitan and Mademoiselle, 
the Seven Sisters were traditional-
ly aimed at stay-at-home mothers 
with hungry children and dis-
tracted, overworked husbands. 

Redbook and Lad,es' Home 
Journal are the only two that now 
regularly include the more 
explicit sexual content. Their 
shift toward sexier stories - the 
February Ladies' Home Jou/7IQl, 
for example, featured a new sex 
column, and RtdOOok's February 

issue had sex-oriented features 
like "What Your Se Dreams Say 
About You" - reflects only a 
part of the changing dynamics of 
the magazine industry, which 
can best be described as: Sex 
sells. 

Samir Husni, a professor of 
media studies at the University 
of Missis ippi and a clo 
observer of the magazine indllS-
try, said that one reason the 
women's service magazines are 
featuring more sex is that they 
are keeping pace with the rest of 
the field. "The Seven Sisters are 
all general inlerest magazines, 
and now you ha ve ta rgeted 
women's magazines like £lIe 
and jalll' that are nibbling away 
at their circulalion," he sa id. 

Rtdbook has made the biggest 
effort to adjust its image and 
position and has added more 
sexual content under the guid-
ance of Lesley Jane Seymour, the 
editor in chief.

Airlines Revamping Their Coach Sections 
Passengers who fly economy 

class may soon find the back of 
the plane a little more comfort-
able - if they can find seats. 

In the first widespread 
change in the passenger cabin 
since the creation of business 
class two decades ago, several 
large airlines are now overhaul-
ing their coach sections. 

The goal is to increase profits, 
but different carriers are trying 
far different routes to that end. 
British Airways and United 
Airlines are dividing their coach 
cabins into two classes -premi-
um and economy - and charg-
ing passengers more if they 
w ant the extra legroom of premi-
um. American Airlines, mean-
while, is remOVing two rows of 
seats in coach cabins to give all 
passengers three more inches of 
sprawl space at no extra charge. 
Only one other carrier, Virgin 
Atlantic, offers gradations with-
in coach, having introduced 
them several years ago. 

Some passengers are decid-
edly enthusiastic. 

"This extra room in coach 

will make a big difference for 
me," said Harry Dodge, a retired 
owner of an oil well services 
company, who is 6 foot .. inches 
tall. "1 have taken some 
transcontinental flights and 
developed some painful cramps 
in my legs. I swore that r would 
never fly again." 

The airlines are betting 
thatenoughpanengen 
will be wilting to pay 
more for extra legroom. 

Passengers paying rock-bot-
tom fares - whether keeping 
the same legroom, on British Air 
and United , or gelting slightly 
more, on American - will have 
fewer seats available to them. 
This will often lead to more 
crowded planes - and more 
competition for coveted over-
head luggage space. 

The airlines are betting that in a 
booming economy, enough pas-
sengers will Ix; willing to pay 

more for extra legroom - 3 to 7 
inches, depending on the airline. 
By creating premium economy 
service - separate from existing 
business class - the carriers can 
accommodate more business trav-
elers, who buy, only 20 percent of 
all ' airline tickets yet account for 
half the industry's profits. At the 
same time, the airlines can rely 
less on budget passengers, whose 
fares are sometimes so low that 
the carriers lose money on them. 

How much more will travel-
ers pay? That could vary Widely. 
01) a United flight from New 
York to Chicago, for example, an 
Economy Plus ticket sells for 
51,(J94 (compared with $1,602 for 
first class), while the cheapest 
economy seat is priced at $324. 
On American from New York to 
Chicago, the lowest fare is $209. 

With fewer coach seats avail-
able, that fare is likely to sell out 
faster, forcing economy passen-
gers to pay a t least 20 percent 
more for the next available dis-
count fare.

Proposition 22, the initiative to restrict same-sex marriages, sparks controversy among students

P ....... In ... : The lesbians' wedding ceremony was 
presided over by Rabbi Lisa Goldstein on February 16. 

f1 
roposition 22, formerly known as the Knight 
Initiative and the Protection of Marriage ini-
tiative but now officially renamed as the 
Limit on Marriage initiative, has qualified 
for the March 7, 2000 ballot in Califomia. 

It reads, "Only marriage between a man 
and a woman is valid or recognized in Califor-
nia." 

This piece of legislation is very similar to the 
Defense of Marriage Act, passed by the federal 
government in a Senate vote of 84 to 15, a House 
vote of 342 to 67 and signed into law by President 
Clinton. 

According to the American Civil Liberties 
Union, DOMA violates equal protection in the 
due process clause of the Fifth Amendment and 
violates the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the 
U.S. Constitution. 

"In addition to redefining the federal defini-
tion of marriage, the bill would create a 'gay 
exception' to the Constitution's Full Faith and 
Credit Clause by allowing states to ignore same-
sex marriages performed in any other state," 
states the ACLU. DOMA also denies federal 
recognition and federal benefits to state-licensed 
same-sex~ 
...... 

Not all students are organized against Propo- . 
sition 22. Walking through campus, one can see 
the signs both in support of and against the pro-
posed restriction on marriage initiative. 

There is more organized activity in opposition 
to the initiative, however. According to UCSD 
student Andy Boettcher, the Student Alliance for 
Fairness and Equality has primarily been orga-
nized in opposition to Propositions 21 and 22. 
According to Boettcher, S.A.F.E. is working to 
convey to students that these propositions are 
discriminatory and detrimental to the welfare of 
Californians. 

Proposition 21 would increase penalties for 
crimes committed by juveniles and gang mem-

bers and would transfer the power to decide 
whether juveniles are tried as adults for murder 
and violent sex crimes from judges to prosecu-
tors. 

S.A.F.E. has organized a number of rallies in 
opposition to the Limits on Marriage Act and the 
Juvenile Justice Initiative. On Tuesday, Jan. 18, 
S.A.F.E. organized a rally in the Price Center urg-
ing students to vote no on Propositions 21 and 
22. Both San Diego Attorney M.E. Stephens and 
Janice Jordan, the mayoral candidate from the 
Peace and Freedom party, spoke at the rally. 

In February, S.A.F.E. members organized a 
wedding between two women that was "inter-
rupted" by a volunteer posing as a Knight (in 
shining armor). The staged wedding, presided 
over by Rabbi Lisa Goldstein, was designed to 
show grievances that members of S.A.F.E. had 
against arguments made by proponents of 
Proposition 22.

Although it is currently illegal for same-sex 
couples to marry, the California Assembly recent-

domestic partnership law. Authored by Assem-

Specifically, the new domestic partnership 
law allows unmarried, adult, same-sex couples 
not related by blood who reside together to reg-

WALT DICKINSON 
Design Editor 

My dad told me a story once 
(probably before I ever came to 
UCSD) about Michael Crichton, 
the author of Jurassic Park. It 
seems Crichton went to medical 
school, but after his first year he 
decided he didn' t like it. He went 
to tell an advisor that he wanted 
out but was assured that he was 
just feeling first-year jitters and 
that he'd like it more if he stuck 
with it. 

So Crichton continued but 
returned at the end of the next 
year to try to quit again. Again, 
however, he was persuaded to 
continue because they assured 
him he was just getting to the 
interesting part of his studies. 

When Crichton returned his 
third year and once again stated 
that he wanted to quit, the advi-
sor pOinted out that Crichton was 
nearly finished . Just because he 
didn' t like what he was doing, 
why should he throwaway 
everything he'd invested in those 
three years? So Crichton stuck 
with it. 

Crichton finally quit after 
qualifying to become a doctor

THE EDITOR'S SOAPBOX 
If after five years you don't succeed, consider quitting 
and never practiced. 

That story has plagued me 
throughout my turbulent college 
career. If I don't like what I'm 
doing, then why am I here. 

Of course, r haven' t disliked 
every class I've taken at UCSD. 
Many of them have been incred-
ibly interesting and valuable for 
me. Moreover, I've enjoyed 
many classes, even if they have 
no bearing on my expected 
career path. 

However, it's impossible to 
escape the idea that I might be 
better off cutting my losses and 
trying something else, just as 

result of working at the Guardian 
for nearly five years or switch-
ing majors after second year .... 
These are all valid drains on my 
educational career but it's hard 
to ignore the fact that once in a 
while, I have one of these quar-
ters that makes me want to 
leave. 

This most recent dismal 
epiphany took place around fifth 
or sixth week of fall quarter, dur-
ing that thrilling period when we 
get our midterms back. When 
you've only got three quarters left 
and most of your classes are only 
offered once a year the last thing 

There was a point last quarter when it became 
unnervingly obvious to me that there was a distinct 
possibility that I might not pass all of my classes and 
therefore not graduate. This realization might not 
have put me in such a bad mood had this not been 
my fifth year at UCSD. 
Crichton finally did. 

At one point last quarter when 
it became unnervingly obvious to 
me that there was a distinct possi-
bility that I might not pass all of 
my classes and therefore not 
graduate. This realization might 
not have put me in such a bad 
mood if this had not been my fifth 
year at UCSD. • 

I tell myself on a regular basis 
that the reason I'm still here (sit-
ting in Center Hall, walking the 
Library Walk, getting food poi-
soning at t.he Price Center) is the 

you want to see is bad midterm 
grades. 

Of course, regardless of what I 
wanted to see, you only get out of 
your work what you put in and I 
didn't like the way things looked. 
I started wondering if dropping 
out of college is really as pathetic 
and sad as I've built it up to be in 
my mind. 

Naturally, my friends said it 
couldn't be that bad and never 
really believed l'd leave, but 
when I explained it clearly and 
explained .my scores they did 

start to agree that I might be here 
longer than I'd expected. "A lot 
of peor,le go to college for seven 
years.' "Yeah, they're called 
doctors." ("Tommy Boy," 1995) 

So there I was, actively think-
ing of all the cool opportunities 
and drastically more interesting 
experiences available to the bold 
individual who took stock of his 
situation and just quit. Degrees 
are great and everything, but I 
was on the verge of cashing it in 
for a little freedom. 

Looking back on it now, I'm 
not sure why I was so worried. I 
knew that if I failed to pass even 
one of my classes I'd be forced to 
take summer school, or worse. In 
hindsight it's clear that I overre-
acted a bit. 

Fortunately I busted my ass 
and passed all the classes, some 
with surprisingly high grades. It 
was a relief to pass, but the whole 
experience illustrated to me once 
again that there are no standards 
in grading and the only thing you 
can do is study like crazy and 
pray. 

So I guess the message here 
(as with all of my stories) is 
don't fear the possibility of fail-
ing. It's probably more liberat-
ing than you can possibly imag-
ine. Remember to give what 
you're doing a fair shot before 
you kick it to the curb and drive 
away.

Human Development Major Uses Department Resources 
Faculty created an interdisciplinary major that unites different departments; original organizers now govern 

rna or 
--_ .. _-... Issues 

ALEX LEE 
Contributing taff Writer 

For many college students, 
deciding on their major is one of 
the more difficult decisions they 
will face in their young lives. For 
students interested in finding a 
major offering a broad-based pro-
gram with a diverse curriculum, 
human develop major might be 
just what they're looking for. 

An interdisciplinary program 
that allows students to take 
courses in a wide variety of fields 
ranging from psychology and 
sociology to biology and cogni-
tive science, the human devefop-
ment major remains one of the 
most unique offered at UCSD. 

Now in its fifth year, human 
development was created in 
hopes of combining the many 
developmental majors already 
existing on campus, such as com-
munication, psychology and cog-
nitive science. The human devel-
opment program focuses on the 
human being from different 
viewpoints, each emphasizing a 
unique aspect of development. 
The major stemmed from the 
combined efforts of many depart-
ments. 

"The professors wanted to cre-
ate a major that would unify the 

great developmental department 
resources already available at 
UCSD," said Shannon Roberts, 
the student affairs coordinator. 
"The same people that wanted to 
create the human development 
major now govern it as its facul-
ty." 

The following consists of the 
main faculty: Joan Stiles (cogni-
tive science), Carol Padden (com-
munication),. Michael Cole (com-
munication), Mark Appelbaum 
(linguistics), Gedeon Deak (cog-
nitive science), Aaron Cicourel 
(cognitive science) and Shirley 
McGuire (psychology). 

According to the human 
development Web page, the 

biological development 'aspect 
focuses on the biological and sen-
sory bases of development. The 
psychological development 
aspect studies the processes of 
cognitive and linguistic develop-
ment, along with the factors that 
influence people's interaction 
with others. Socio-cultural devel-
opment explores the social 
aspects of development, includ-
ing interaction among peers, fam-
ily relations, schooling in children 
and SOCial issues for the elderly. 

One of the biggest highlights 
of the human development major 
is the level of fleXibility within its 
curriculum. This allows students 
to take a broad array of classes in 

"The ~uirements are still 
rather strict. ' she says. "You still 
have to have a lot of classes taken 
care of like biology, psychology, 
and sociology. Plus there's a lab 
and field work which is also 
where the real hands-on part 
comes into play. The major is by 
no means easy, but it's still very 
enjoyable. " 

Grade requirements for the 
major are the following: a mini-
mum G.P.A. of 2.0 with a grade 
of C- or better in any course 
counted toward fulfillment of 
major requirements. In order to 
satIsfy the major's lower and 
upper-division requirements, all 
cfasses must be taken for a letter 

Almost as diverse as the Human Development major itself are the subsequent 
careers students can pursue after their unde1lfraduate studies. The vast majority 
of graduates have pursued careers in teaching and counselling. Still, many 
others have pursued careers varying from Law to Scientific Research. 
major explores a series of basic, 
fundamental questions: What 
underlies the development of 
human knowledge? To what 
extent is the capacity to know, 
indeed the concepts of them-
selves, encoded in the genes? 
How is the role of learning and 
environmental influences 
accounted for? How do we learn? 
What are the ways in which chil-
dren become competent partici-
pants in their social groups? 
What is the origin and nature of 
social interaction and organiza-
tion? 

The hUl"(I3n development pro-
gram is divided into three broad 
areas: biological development, 
psychological development, an"d 
socio-cultural development. The 

order to fulfill their undergradu-
ate requirements. This flexibility 
and broad-based curriculum is 
what attracted Roosevelt senior 
Jennie Church-Cooper to the 
major. . 

Hit allows students to gear 
toward specific areas that they are 
interested in," she says. "In other 
words, you can look through each 
of the broad requirements and see 
which ones interest you. As a 
result, you have the opportunity 
to take classes from many fields, 
so long as they're within the gen-
era I limits of development." 

ChUfch-Cooper adds, howev-
er, that the freedom to choose 
such diverse classes can some-
times be misleading for some stu-
dents. 

grade. 
Lower-division requirements 

include the following: one intro-
ductory course in human devel-
opment (HOPI), one quarter of 
statistics (psychology 60 or Cog-
nitive Science 14), two natural sci-
ence courses, one introductory 
computer course and two formal 
skills courses. 

Upper-division requirements 
include the following: one labora-
tory course, four foundation 
courses, seven developmental 
courses, one advanced human 
development course and one field 
research course. 

A student can also choose to 
minor in human development. 
Seven courses are required to fin-
ish the human development 

minor. Courses needed include 
the following: Introduction to 
Human Development (HDPl) 
and six developmental courses. 

With such a broad curriculum, 
scheduling can become a chal-
lenge. As Roberts points out, 
scheduling the right classes to ful-
fill certain requirements is one of 
the biggest challenges of the 
major. Nonetheless, she reminds 
students that the faculty is well-
aware of this. 

HIt's true that students have to 
stay on top of the courses that are 
offered/ Roberts said, "but they 
shouldn't worry too much. We 
provide academic adviSing 
throughout the quarter where we 
help each student with any 
potential problems in schedul-
ing." 

Almost as diverse as the 
human development major itself 
are the subsequent careers stu-
dents can pursue after their 
undergraduate studies. The vast 
majority of graduates have pur-
sued careers in teaching and 
counseling. Still, many othE'fs 
have pursued careers varying 
from law to scientific research . 

"Our students really do it 
all," Roberts said. "Students can 
get involved with so many 
fields, like physical therapy, 
public health, social work and 
even medicine." 

Students interested in the 
human development major can 
seek advising everyday from 1 
p.m. to 4 p.m. at McGill Annex in 
room 3575. They can also visit the

State must show

c ..... , .............. U 
example of why OOMA is not 
discriminatory is a hard pill to 
swallow for gay and lesbian 
activists who demonstrate that 
homosexuality is not a choice. 
......... 

Much of the recent furor over 
gay marriages has come from 
Supreme Court rulings in 
Hawaii, where the legalization 
of homosexual marriages has 
been considered. 

In 1991, three lesbian and gay 
couples sued the Hawaii Health 

Department for denying them 
civil marriage licenses in a case 
called Baehr vs. Anderson. In 
1993, the Hawaii Supreme Court 
ruled that the state's marriage 
policy violated the state consti-
tution's prohibition against sex-
based discrimination, and 
ordered a trial for the Health 
Department to prove that there 
is compelling state interest in 
limiting marriage to heterosexu-
al couples. 

Hawaii First Circuit Court 
Judge Kevin S.c. Chang, due to 
the state's failure to prove com-
pelling interest in discriminating 
against homosexual couples, 
ruled in 1996 that it was uncon-
stitutional for the health depart-
ment to continue the practice of 

denying marriage licenses to 
same-sex couples. Chang also 
stayed his decision, allowing the 
state time to appeal to the 
Hawaii Supreme Court. 

In 1998, while the Supreme 
Court considered Baehr, Hawaii 
passed a state constitutional 
amendment to grant the legisla-
ture a new power to "reserve 
marriage" for heterosexual cou-
ples only. The amendment does 
not specifically define marriage, 
however, and the session con-
cluded without lawmakers final-
jzing the legal definition. 

The Supreme Court issued a 
ruling foregoing further argu-
ment on the issue and is expect-

MARRIAGE: 
Knight feels media 
has exploited his son 
ContInued from ..... 13 
ed to issue a decision soon. 

Vermont has encountered a 
similar situation - three couples 
sued the state heal th department 
for denying them ma rriage licens-
es in a case known as Baker vs. 
Vermont. 

A trial court dismissed the 
case in 1997 based on the argu-
ment made by the state that the 
marriage agreement is based on 
an intention to procrea te, despi te 
the fact that marriage licenses are 
still issued to couples who cannot 
or do not procreate. 

The case made it to the 
Supreme Court in 1998, where 
justices were skeptical about the 
procreation defense. 

According to the Lamda Lega l 
Defense and Education Fund, the 
legalization of same-sex marriage 
in Vermont and Hawaii would 
not end the struggle for equal 
rights. 

The UCSD Guardian Monday, February 28, 2000 

The organization states tha t, 
"Even a watershed court decision 
in Hawaii or Vermont will not 
end the struggle to win the free-
dom to marry, because legal mar-
riages of same-sex couples still 
would be treated as second class 
by the federal government 
[because of OOMAJ and some 
states. Continued litigation and 
poli tical advocacy will be needed 
after the breakthrough."

Propo ..... ts 
Proposition 22 has had a lot of 

controversy surrounding it 
because of its original sponsor, 
State Sen. Pete Knight (R-Palm-
dale). Currently, sa me-sex mar-
riage is not legal in any of the SO 
states. 

Pete Knight has been a source 

of controversy since his initial 
sponsorship. Because he has posi-
tioned himself as a defender of 
the sanctity of marriage, some 
have questioned his one divorce 
while others have addressed the 
issue of his son, who is gay. 
According to the San Prancisco 
Chronic/e, Pete Knight also had a 

gay brother who died of AIDS. 
Pete Knight's son David came 

out against Proposition 22 for the 
first time on Feb. 24, 2()()(). 

. "I completely disagree with 
my father and I don' t think this ilt 
right," said the younger Knight. 
"What he is attempting to do is 
single out a group that have pri-

vate, personal relationships .... I 
wish he understood that, but he 
doesn' t." 

Pete Knight feels that the 
media and "No on Knight" orga-
nizers have exploited his relation-
ship with his son in order to 
advance their cause. 

"Every family has its prob-

lems, but I think my son knows in 
his heart that Proposition 22 is 
about public policy and has noth-
ing to do with him and me," Pete 
Knight said.

tion 22 include radio personality

MARRIAGE: 
Dr. Laura supports 
Proposition 22 

Dr. Laura Schlessinger. 
According to Dr. Laura, an 

affirmative vote for Proposition 
22 doesn't serve to discriminate 
against any group of people. 
Rather it affirms the definition of 
marriage as between men and 
women in our society. She has 
urged her listeners to educate 
themselves and others about this 
important pro-family legislation. 

Dr. Laura's message attracted 
the attention of San Francisco-
based Horizons, the nation's first 
gay and lesbian foundation in 
addition to more then 180 child 
welfare organizations, health and 
medical associations, civil rights 
and civil liberties groups, rabbis 
and other religious leaders, as well 
as advocates for gay rights who 
took out advertisements in The 
Examiner, the San Francisco Chroni-
cle and the Los Angeles Times. 

"Our concern is that Dr. Laura 
is reaching 20 million people a 
day, day in, day out, with the 
message that gays and lesbians 
are deviant, that we are biological 
errors, that we can and should be 
cured," said Peter League, Hori-
zons executive director. "She 
issues an invitation to think of 
gays and lesbians as inferior, as 

less than human." 
Dr. Laura immediately 

defended her position. 
"Unless I have hallucinated, I 

have never made an anti-gay 
commentary," Schlessinger said. 
"I have made anti-gay-activist-
agenda commentaries." 

According to an interview of 
Schlessinger in the Advocate, a 
gay magazine, her message about 
homosexuality has grown sterner 
since she went on the air in 1996 
as a result of her deepening 
Orthodox Jewish faith and the 
"rise of ·the radical gay and les-
bian agenda." 

According to Tile Exa~niner, her 
warnings against gay parenting 
and gar marriage and her advo-
cacy 0 efforts to 'cu re' gays fit 
into her sharp moral commentary 
on lile. She rails against unmar-
ried couples living together and 
b;:rital sex. 

..... 
The list of people who oppose 

proposition 22 is equally lengthy. 
Surprisingly, included among the 
opponents is Gov. Davis. 

"As I made clear in my cam-
paign, I have always opposed 
same-sex marriage," Davis said. 
" I also made clear that I oppose 
wedge-issue politics that have 
divided one California from 
another and made scapegoats of 
certain groups of our citizens. 
Proposition 22, in my opinion, is

clearly in that' category. It is an 
unnecessary distraction because 
current California law already 
clearly and unequivocally limits 
marriage to a man and a woman." 

Opponents of Proposition 22 
argue that "you don't have to be 
in favor of gay marriage to be 
against the Knight Initiative." 

According to Flowe, the fight 
for marital rights for homosexu-
als is similar to the Civil Rights 
movement. 

"YOll do not have to be for gay 
marriage or the gay lifestyle to 
vote against Prop. 22; you just 
have to be against discrimina-
tion," Flowe said. "I think that the 
passage of Prop. 22 would be a 
sad legacy for our children to 
read about in the history books." 

March 2: Ponder the past and 
your future, and you may find a 
way to shed old fears. 

March 3: Don't despair. The 
effort you put in now will be a 
good investment, financially and 
spiritually, too. 

March 4: The more you face 
your fears, the stronger you 
become. Analysis is fascinating, 
but faith pulls you through. 

March 5: You are strong, in a 
quiet way. Give up control and 
access healing power.

This seaacin was a stark 
contrast to last season's 
excellent 20-5 effort. 

"I think that aU of the 
breaks that happened last 
year to go 20-5 didn't hap-
pen this year, and we went 
5-20," Lanthier said. "They 
worked hard and did the 
best they could." 

This was the Tritons' last 
season in Division III com-

Liebengood, who had a 
fantastic game as she 
struck out 10 Triton batters 
and gave up only four hits 
for the complete game vic-
tory. 

"We need to have 
stronger bodies. We need a 
higher level of strength," 
Lanthier said. "!t's hard to 
say [what will happen in 
Division 11 play). It will be a 
tougher schedule and a bet-
ter competition." 

With a new crop of fresh-
man coming in next year, 
Lanthier and his staff hope 
for better luck in 2000-2001 .

,---_________________ ----. Tritons scored the addition-
al run as the Lions came 
back with three runs of their 
own in the sixth. It was too 
little too late and UCSD 
escaped with a victory. 

"Their pitcher was 
throwing a lot of junk," 
Gerckens said. "We were 
not making adjustments. 
We needed to slow our 
swing a little." . 

Benning started the inning 
with a bunt, and the Tritons' 
infield could not decided 
who would pick it up as 
Benning reached first safely.

The first game was 
unfortunately not like the 
second for UCSO. 

The Tritons had started 
the season 4-0 and had 
outscored their opponent 
30-0 during that span. 
Against Vanguard, the 
Tritons hit a road block. 

"We couldn't get the hits 
we needed," sa id Triton 
Head Coach Patti Gerckens. 
" We couldn' t get people 
into scoring position." 

The winning pitcher for 
the Lions was Gina 

Harlan, despite the loss 
on the mound for UCSO, 
also had a great game as she 
too allowed only four hits. 
She struck out five, but the 
hits and her two walks 
allowed two runs. 

"She pitched a great 
~ame," Gerckens said . 
'They made adjustments 
when they needed to get the 
big hit. Other than that, we 
were both swinging poor-
ly." 

It was a clear pitcher 'S 
duel until the sixth inning 
when Vanguard figured out 

Benning and teammate 
Erin Gomez each scored off 
a two-run Stacey Caggiano 
single and the game was 2-
O. 

The Tritons could not 
muster any runs and fin-
ished the game scoreless as 
four different Tritons gar-
nered one hit each. 

The Tritons hit the road 
for their next set of games. 

UCSD will be in

PERFECT: Triton look dominant against Western New Mexico and Grand Canyon College 
By ARVIND VASAN 
Staff Writer 

After a two-week layoff, the 
women's tennis team improved 
its record to four victories and no 
losses after dominating Crand 
Canyon College and Western 

ew Mexico University. 
Competing against Grand 

Canyon College on Feb. 25, the 
Tritons came out triumphant 
with a score of 7-2. 

" It was a great match," 
women's tennis Head Coach Liz 
laPlante said. "Since we had a 
long layoff between matches, and 
this was a DiviSion 11 school, we 
thought that our performance 
wouldn't be our best. But we 
stayed tough, focused and 
intense. We have a lot of depth 
and our girls rose to the occasion." 

The home match produced 
two close three-set scores, in 
which the tearns split victories. 

Yen Yen Ho won 6-4 in a thrilling 
three-set match. Lyndsey 
Tadlock pulled out a close sec-
ond set and eventually lost 6-3 in 
the final set. Kirsten Olsen and 
Rachel Gunther put together 
solid performances, winning in 
straight sets in singles play. 

The Tritons won five matches 
in singles and two in doubles . 

"Coming into the match, we 
had great practice sessions, but 
you never know how well you 
will play on game time," 
laPlante said. "1I's a whole new 
story to get on the court and play 
new opponents for the first time. 
We showed our toughness and 
poise during critical moments of 
the match." 

The team also hosted Western 
New Mexico, emerging with an 
8-1 victory. 

Missing one of its players, 
Western ~ew Mexico defaulted a 
singles and doubles match. 

UCSD took out the opponent's 
top four 'players in singles to let 
others on the team compete. 

The UCSD team dominated 
singles, losing only one match. 
The o. 1 Olsen, No.2 Gunther 
and Jamie Walker won 6-1, 6-0; 6-
0,6-1 and 6-0, 6-0, respectively. 

The team won both matches 
in doubles. The team of Amy 
Tranckino and Lyndsey 
Tadlockwon won 8-3 and Olsen 
and Gunther won 8-2. 

"We dominated this match 
from beginning to end," 
LaPlante said. "1 was happy to 
see everyone playing with confi-
dence and control." 

The team's next big task is the 
Pomona-Pitzer Classic in 
Claremont, March 10-12. 
Opponents will include 
Washington University on Friday, 
defending Division III champion 
Amherst College on Saturday 

an~ Rhodes College on Sunday. 

The Tritons lost to Amherst in 
the quarterfinals of the champi-
onship last year and are looking 
for another shot at dominating 
the defending champions. 

"The Pomona tournament 
will be huge for our record and 
confidence going into the cham-
pionships at the end of the year. 
Amherst is the defending 
Division III champion, and we 
are eager for a rematch," 
LaPlante said. "That will be a 
great test to see how we fair 
against a quality team such as 
Amherst. We have the depth 
and determination to [beat 
them)." 

laPlante also added thal the 
team is healthy and ready for the 
challenge ahead. 

"We have two weeks of rest 
ahead of us, mainly to get pre-
pared for Claremont and espe-
cially the match against Amherst 
University," laPlante said. 

The referee told us that if a girl 
scored on the penalty shot we 
would be given four points, so 
one of our girls lined up for the 
kick. This was it, our chance to 
score our first goal of the season. 

As the kick went into the air I 
could not believe what I saw. The 
baU was headed for the net and 
the goalie did not appear to be 
able to stop it. -

When it went into the goal I 
did not know what to do. We 
had not experienced this emo-
tion all year. We cheered inces-
santly and when the final whis-
tle brew, we walked off the field 
triumphantly with a 5-4 loss. 
The referee had to actually 
remind us that 

Who knows? Perhaps next 
week we may score another goal. 
That would be worth getting up 
in the morning for.

were no match for Triton talent, 
and the fact that La Verne scored 
as many points in each game as it 
did was due to its willingness to 
take a beating. 

The Leopards' Jake SwaM, 
recording 23 kills for his team, 
played a major role in the out-
come of the game in allowing the 
Leopards to hang around with 
UCSD for longer than people 
thought they would. Teammate 
Dave ~on racked a compara-
tive 20 kilTs. In the end, however, 
the Tritons extended the 
Leopards' losing streak to nine 
matches, leaving them bitterly 
sporting a 0-9 record on the sea-
son. 

The following Friday, UCSD 
brought its 4-8 record to Provo, 
Utah to face Brigham Young 
University. The outcome of this 
match was not as bright and the 
Tritons were knocked off 15-5, 15-
4, 15-6. - BYU, like UCLA, 
Stanford and other Division I 
powerhouses, was one of several 
physically superior opponents 
the Tritons have played this sea-
son. After splitting on its road 
trip, UCSD will be able to get by 
in the Division III championship 
if it can effectively execute in 
every facet of its game. 

"It's a matter of doing every-
thing well at the same time," Hite 
said. 

There are times when keyele-
ments of UCSD's game are off, 
and it is then that the Tritons run 
into trouble. If they can pass well 
and play consistent defense, they 
will not have a problem dictating 
the pace of the match against 
their opponents and putting up 
points. 

The "&itons will drive across 
town to play San DIego State 
Univo?lSity on Wednesday March 
1 before retuming home to face 
the University of Pacific the fol-
lowing Friday night. 

END: 
Season finale proves 
to be a success 
CoIItI ..... from .... 24 
regular season with a fine record 
of 26-5. 

Last Saturday, the Tritons 
played their final home game of 
the year but fell 74-68 to UC Santa 
Cruz. 

"It was not one of our better 
efforts," said Lanthier. "They 
wanted it more than we did." 

The Tritons found themselves 
down 36-24 at halftime but bat-
tled back in the second half. 

Down 53-39 with 13 minutes 
left, things looked precarious for 
the home team. 

UCSD went on an 11-0 run to 
pull to within 53-SO. 

That would be as close as the 
Tritons would get, as the Banana 
Slugs staved off a Triton come-
back. 

Higgins had a another big 
game for UCSD as he put in 29 
points and added five rebounds 
and three steals. 

Russ was huge despite the loss 
as he scored 14 points and pulled 
down eight rebounds. 
Christensen added 13 points. 

UCSD had four players in 
double-digits. 

Chad Wells had a big game for 
the Banana Slugs with 23 points 
and 10 rebounds. James Darr 
scored 17, Michael Halligan 
added 12 and Jake Steubbe !!COred 
10 and pulled down eight 
rebounds.

of their opponents as they 
cruised to a 8-2 victory. 

In singles the Tritons swept 
the Mustangs, but some of the 
matches were closer than they 
should have been. 

At number one singles, Meyer 
had little trouble and easily won 
6-3, 6-2. Meyer is returning to 
health, as a foot injury hampered 
his .play in the previous week-
end's matches. 

Moderhak played number two 
singles for the Tritons and embar-
rassed his opponent 6-0, 6-l. 

"It was a pretty routine victo-
ry," Moderhak said. "He didn't 
present much of a challenge." 

At number three singles, Dan 
Albrecht made his first appear-
ance in singles all year, as he has 
been hampered by injury. 
Albrecht looked tight but did 
show flashes of being his old self 
as he pulled out a close three-set 
victory 6-1, 5-7,7-5. 

Thompson had no trouble 
with his opponents and was 
quickly off of the court with a 6-
0, 6-1 thrashing of the Mustangs' 
number four singles competitor. 

Ari Frankel made his match 

exciting, as he usually does, at 
number five Singles. After win-
ning the first set 6-4, the second 
set went to a tie-breaker, which 
Frankel won 9-7. 

Scott Anderson took on the 
Mustangs' Erik Caudur at num-
ber six singles and had no trou-
ble at all. Anderson was off the 
court quickly after recording a 6-
1, 6-1 thrashing of Caudur. 

With the win over Division II 
Western New Mexico, the Tritons' 
record now stands at an impressive 
4-2. UCSD also defeated the only 
Division Ul opponent it has played 
SO far when it played Chapman 
University earlier this season 

Villanova University is next 
up for the Tritons. 

"They are about as good as 
Redlands and Redlands is 
ranked No. 2 in the West in 
Division 111," Moderhak said. 
"The match will be a good way 
to see where we are as a team." 

That match takes place 
Tuesday at 2 p.m. Get out to 
Muir's North Courts and root the 
Tritons on in what should be an 
exciting and closely contested bat-
tle against a Division I opponent.

Nothing better than 
intermural soccer 

Intramural soccer is one of 
man's greatest inventions: 
There are very few things that 
can wake me up out of my 
hung-over haze on a Saturday 
morning, but a 10 a.m. soccer 
game can. 

Last Saturday the alarm 
went off, and I did what I 
generally do on school days: 
turned it off and went back to 
sleep. It was not until my 
friend called to wake me up 
that I realized that the alarm 
was not buzzing for some 
boring economics class but 
for my soccer game. This was 
a completely different story. 
In tead of turning over and 
going back to leep, I quickly 
jumped out of bed and got 
ready for the big game. I was 
ready and waiting to be 
pIcked up in les than five 
minutes, anxious to get th 
day under way. 

Once at the game, I realized 
I should have just stayed in 
bed . My team i horrible. We 
are worse than horrible. We 
are downright pathetic. We get 
intimidated when a player on 
the other team has shin pads. 
It reminds me a lot of a team I 
played on in the American 
Youth Soccer ' AssoCiatlOrf 
when I was five years old. All 
nine of our players run toward 
the ball at all times. We are like 
one big swarm. We have yet to 
realize that passing is a skill 
that the better teams have 
mastered, and that they could 
always kick the ball faster than 
we could run after it. 

As a result, the only thing 
we get accomplished most of 
the time is tiring ourselves out. 
Most of the entertainment 
comes from seeing what funny 
things my teammates do 
before the final whistle blows. 

This week the list wa long 
and di tinguished . First of all, 
before the game got started, 
our team caplain declared that 
we felt we had a chance to win 
the intramural championship. 
He was obviously joking, but 
it did not make the other team 
laugh very much and just 
made them all that much more 
eager to kick our collective ass. 

When the game got going it 
did not take long for one of my 
friends to kick the ball clear 
out of R'IMAC field and onto 
the street. The game resumed 
after the ball was retrieved 
with several failed a ttempts to 
hop the fence . There were 
numerous times when we 
tried to kick the ball but com-
pletely missed, causing the ref-
eree to laugh hysterica11y at us. 
At halftime we had not made 
any goals and the score was 4-
O. When the game really got 
out of hand the referee even 
began helping us, calling 
penalties on the other team 
just so they would not com-
pletely embarrass us. 

With one milwte left the 
game was 5-0, and honestly, it 
should have been 20-0. The 
opposition committed a hand-
ball in the box, and we were

Tritons Triumph at La Verne 
LEOPARD-SKlN: The victory solidifies UCSD's claim on a birth in the NCAA' Playoffs 
By BRIAN WELLES 
Associate Sports EdItor 

After a well-deserved eight" 
days of rest, the UCSD men's vol-
leyball team was well-prepared to 
confront the Division III 
University of La Verne Leopards 
- a much weaker team than the 
Division I powerhouses that have 
been dominating its lineup of late. 

After being blasted by 
Division I powers like Stanford, 
the Triton refused to spend their 
down-time sulking over misfor-
tunes suffered earlier in the year, 
and instead concentrated on culti-
vating a winning attitude for the 
rest of the season. 

The seeds for a victorious run 
at a Division III champIonship are 
almost undoubtedly ready to 
blossom. 

After a solid week of practice, 
UCSD and its rivals stepped onto 
the court Wednesday, Feb. 23. 

In a match that allowed for con-
sistent play from UCSD's end, the 
Tritons beat La Verne in three 
straight games -15-12,15-13,15-
12. The Tritons made the same 
hort work of the Leopards on Feb. 

I, beating them at RJMAC Arena 
in three consecutive gilffies. 

This lime, not only did the 
Tritons make Leopard stew of its 
opponent in its home gym before 
200 fans, but they also locked the 
Leopards out of the west playoff 
spot, which for all intents and 

"purposes now belongs to UCSD. 
" Right now, every part of our 

game is in pretty good shape," 
Triton Zack Hite said. 

This win was UCSD's fourth 
win of the year; all four victories 
came at the hands of Division III 
teams. 

The Tritons came out on top last 
Wednesday due in part to the 
adjustments they made during 
their week-long stretch of prepara-
tion. Hite, moving from opposite 
to outside-hitter, switched posi-
tions with teammate Donald Chen. 
Chris Mortimer also assisted in 
jump-starting the play of his team 
by making his debut in the UCSD 
stjlrling lineup as outside-hitter. 

"Trying different stuff put us 
at a good level that we needed to 
be at," Hite said. "Our consisten-
cy was key." 

UCSD's per-game attack was 
more or less homogenous with 20 
kills in the first game as well as 17 
and 18 in the next two. 

The Tritons got a hearty serv-
ing of offense from Donald Chen, 
who had a strong presence in the 
game with 19 kills, 12 errors and a 
team-leading 54 total attempts. 
Kevin Flynn knocked down 11, 
Hite got 10 and Earnie Yun put 
down nine kills. 

The Leopards had several 
opportunities to make the game 
closer than the final score indi-
cates. 

"We let them playa little more 
than we would've liked," Hite said. 
"But we didn't get worried when 
they got up by a point or two." 

From this statistics, it's clear 
that UCSD controlled the tempo 
of the match. The Leopards' skills

Men's Basketball Ends 
Season with Upset Win 
REUEF: Win against The Master's College 
shows potential for next year's squad 
By ROBERT RJLTON

The 1999-2000 UCSD men's 
basketball season came to a close 
this past weekend.

pointing season that resulted 
in a 5-20 record finished 
out on a po itive

turn it over, we scored." 

UCSD had 33 turnovers to the 
Mustangs' 15. Sixteen of the 
Triton turnovers came in the sec-
ond t,alf. 

Sam Higgins had a big game 
for UCSD as he led all scorers

"I think it's good for the 
seniors going out," Triton Head 
Coach Greg Lanthier said. " It 
gets a bad taste out of your 
mouth. It gets us ready for next 
season." 

The Tritons took off for a 
dominant 42-27 advantage at 
half-time. 

The Mustangs battled back in 
the second half and nearly took 
the game as they pulled to with-
in 65-63 before time ran out. 

"We made a lot of shots," said 
Lanthier. "That is very unusual, 
to play ~ team with such a caliber 

win.

game of his college 
career, Ahmad Russ

Softball Suffers Their 
First Loss of the Season 
SPUT: Vanguard ends the Tritons win streak 
in the flfSt game but UCSD takes the second 
By ROBERT RJLTON 
Associate Sports Editor 

The UCSD softball team's fan-
tastic start this season, manifest-
ed in a 4-0 record, came to a halt 
at _ home against Vanguard 
University on Saturday as the 
two teams split a double-header. 

The Lions got the best of the 
Tritons in the first matchup, win-
ning 2-0, but UCSD bounced 
back in the second tilt to win 4-3. 

The winning pitcher fdr 
UCSD in the second game was 
Erin Flannigan. The win was 
Flannigan's third this season. 

Flannigan gave up five hits 
and three runs and struck out 
one in just under six innings of 
work. 

Teammate Leea Harlan cal1)e 
on in relief to pitch a solid orie-
and-one-third innings with two 
strike outs. 

Vanguard's Cheri Smith start-
ed the game for the Lions but 
didn't make it out of the first 
inning, as she gave up three runs 
on four hits in two-thirds of the 
inning. 

Alysia Atchley came in to 
replace Smith and pitched a solid 
game. 

Atchley allowed only fOllr 
hits and one run for the rest of 
the contest, but it was too little to 
late, as UCSD had taken control 
of the game. 

The first inning was all UCSD 
as the Triton bats pummeled 
Smith. 

Christina Searing started the 
game with a double and reached 
third as Michole Wilson went to 
second after a walk. With a dou-
ble by Harlan, Searing and 
Wilson came around to score. 

After Harlan reached third, 
Jeanine Cordero drove her in 
with a single and UCSD was 
already up 3-0. 

The Tritons added another 
run in the fourth inning. 

The Tritons Cynthia Sam 
reached base on an error and 
promptly stole second. Kristina 
Anderson singled to right to 

.drive in Sam and for the 4-0 lead. 
It was a good thing the
