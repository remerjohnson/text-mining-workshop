Student aid: s.nip, snip, snip 
BY PAULA THOMAS 

You may have heard that 
the Reagan administration is 
proposing to weaken or 
eliminate many national 
financial aid programs. You 
may have also heard campus 
administrators and student 
politicians screaming that the 
cuts will bring an educational 
apocalypse to the UC 
campuses. 

How founded are these 
fears? How are the budget cuts 
expected to affect UCSD? 

"If I were a student." says 
Chips Dreilinger, Muir Dean 
and chairman of an ad hoc 
finance committee to examine 
the proposed cuts, "I'd be very 
concerned and be active 
(against the cuts). I'd start 
immediately being frugal, and 
looking for a high-paying job." 

The proposed cuts would 
mean a $3 billion loss for 
financial aid for schools across 
the nation. The UC system 
which now receives $130 
million would be reduced to 
only $30 million - a 75 percent 
budget cut. 

If the cuts pass through 
Congress. "it doesn't give a 
whole lot of time for students 
to fi~re out alternatives, if 
any: said Tom Rutter, the 
director of Financial Services. 

Some programs are to be 
totally eliminated, and others 
will be sharply reduced. For 
instance. the St,lpplemental 
Education Opportunity Grant 
(SEOG). is currently funded 
for $370 million. The proposed 
cuts would decrease it to $278 
million for 1982-83. And the 
program would be totally 
eliminated by 1983-84. 

Other programs affected 
would be the National Direct 
Student Loan (NDSL). and the 
State Student Initiative Grant 
(SSIG). Both programs would 
be cut and then eliminated by 
1984. Together, all of these 
programs affect over a million 
students in the nation . 

The most popular program. 
the Guaranteed Student Loan 
(GSL). would also be affected. 
About 3.500 students at UCSD 
have GSLs. The average loan 
is around $3,000, making a 
total of $10.000,000 used each 
year. There is a proposed cut of 
approximately 8 percent for 
the GSL. 

When the cuts are combined 
with inflation, Rutter figured. 
"We'll be short $3 million for 
the truly needy in 82·83." 

To generate this needed 
money. Rutter and the ad hoc 
finance committee plan to 
include a $1,000 GSL in each 
financial aid package. There 
will also be changes in the 
procedures of acquiring and 
paying back the loan. In the 
past, students could wait nine 
months after graduation 
before paying back the loan at 
7% interest. Now students 
must start payments six 
months after graduation at 9% 
interest. After two years, the 
interest goes up to the market 
rate, and the student pays 
back the loan at that rate. 
Most students will have at 
least $3,000 in loans; many 
have larger loans. 

Also in the past, students 
only had to pay a 5% 
origination fee or service 
charge to the bank for a loan. 
Now they will have to pay a 10 
percent fee. 

Fighting the cuts 
Administrators and stu-

dents are prepared to fight 
Reagan's proposed cuts. Last 
week the AS held a postcard 
rally during regisration which 
was very successful. Over 
7,000 cards were filled . 

This week. on Wednesday. 
March 3, there will bea rally in 
the Revelle Plaza at 12 noon. 
The AS strongly urges 
everyone to come. 

"Students cannot afford to 
be apathetic anymore," aid 
Jules Bagneris, AS president, 
"It's up to us to do something." 

This week a congressional 
committee will meet and 
decide on the national 
financial aid cuts. Through 
the postcards, the rally. and 
letters, it is hoped to change 
the minds of key committee 
members. 

Linda Sabo, UC Student 
Regent, explained. "Once it 
goes through (the) committee, 
it's hard to change their 
minds." She added that the 
cuts "will have lon~-term 
devas tating effects,' and 
students should support the 
fight against the cuts. 

The UCSD administration 
is also taking action. An ad hoc 
Financial Committee was 
formed this year in which both 
students and administrators 
are involved. The committee 
advises Rutter, Director of 
Financial Aid, on how to deal 
with cuts and make the 
programs run more smoothly 
and efficiently. 

Rutter said, on behalf of the 
committee, that "we will work 
as hard as we can to let the 
representatives and the 
president know the financial 
programs are important. and 
have been successful. and are 
an intricate part of this 
country. and will have an 
impact on the country." He 
added that a grassroots effort 
will arise to fight the proposed 
cuts. 

Affected student 
Lori Rindfleisch . an 

undergraduate communica-
tions major, is one of the many 
who have already been 
affected by the cuts. She aid 
because of the cuts it means 
that, "basically you are on 
your own." 

For her, "it means working 
full time during the summer. I 
wanted to live on my own but 
will have to stay home now to 
save money." She added that 
she may even need to go to 
relatives for help in financing 
her college education.

Therefore, it is our reponsibi·

The Bottom Line 

Homosexuality: r eality but not norm 
BY MIKE EBERT 

After reading LAGO's full page advertisement 
(UCSD Guardian, Feb. 18),1 see that there is a real 
need to address the "coming out of the closet" of 
homosexuality which has occured within recent 
years. When any issue or problem is brought into the 
light of the public eye two things can occur: either 
thi new issue can be accepted and ingrained as a 
new ocial more or else the is ue can be deemed a a 
problem and can then be dealt with accordingly in a 
sane. senSible manner. Unfortunately, I fear that 
LAGO's purpose along with the general trend in 
society today is the former - to imply accept 
homosexuality as the norm and as a sexual 
preference rather than as a problem. 

I have heard that many psychologists believe that 
everyone posse es certain latent tendencies toward 
homosexuality. I'm not one to argue this point; it 
could very well be true. However this does not 
logically lead to an assumption that homo exuality 
is simply to be accepted a a normal part of society. 
For example, Inside mankind there is often seen 
other hidden orientations - t hose of greed, those of 
self -cen teredness and self·grati fication , and those of 
racial prejudice. We ee many re ults of these inner 
orientations in such things as the rise again of 
organization uch as the Klu Klux Klan which 
"harmlessly" purport the ideology that blacks or 
Jew or Chicanos or even homosexuals are les er 
human beings than themselves. Self·centeredness 
and self-gratification have caused one out of every 
two marriages to crumble, and today is een th 
rapid deterioration of the entire male·female 
relationship. (Looking for one cause of 
homosexuality?) And finally the tragic results of 

greed In our materialistic society are seen In people , 
male and female, student and professional. who 
trade In the value of personal relationship for the 
chance to serve the almighty GPA or the almighty 
buck. My point is thi : none of these results. can be 
deemed as normal or acceptable even though they 
all, like homosexuality, stem from certain inner 
orien tat ions. 

Then how do we treat this emerging trend toward 
"sexual freedom"? Well, I treat it as a problem that 
needs to be tackled head ·on. We were not created for 
male·male and female-female sexual relationships. 
And the bend toward homosexuality is not "a gift 
from God," for Biblically God calls homosexuality 
sin; just as he call adultery, lust, fornication, 
murder. preiudice. and hatred sin . 

To tackle the problem of homosexuality, you don't 
start by throwing stones. "He that is without sin 
among you, let him first cast a stone." I. for one, am 
not perfect when it comes to many attitudes and 
actions I've had toward human sexuali ty. Not many 
people are. However, the problem can genuinely be 
tackled when one finds the root of the problem and 
then offers a real solution . And believe me, there 
truly is a positive way out for those who know that 
they are trapped in homosexuality or even trapped 
in Impure hetero exuality. There indeed exists a 
true" exual freedom." 

The problem of homosexuality stems from 
somewhere insid the same society in which 
prejudice, the loss of natural affection between 
husband and wives, and th loss of love and re peet 
between parent s and chi ldren flouri hes. More 
impOrtantly, the problem Ii somewhere inside of 

the individuals who make up the society. This 
problem can be manifested in many ways. 
Homosexuality is only one manifestation,. and no 
one is immune. The Bible calls the problem sin; you 
can call it what you will, but it is hard to deny its 
per onal reality. 

And the solution to thi inner problem? It is not 
solved by killing off all homosexuals and yet it is not 
solved by simply accepting homosexuality as a norm 
of society. Homosexuality may be a reality in society, 
but it shouldn't be a norm. No, an inner problem 
requires an inner solution . I know of only one place 
to find this inner olution . It is found in the 
forgiveness and acceptance that God himself offers 
each of us through Jesu Christ. Take note, the 
solution isn't found in religious morals or in external 
laws, but rather it is found in the relationship with a 
living Lord. God works from the heart to the action 
and breaks through those walls around us in the 
same way. "If anyone be in Christ he is a new 
creature, the old has passed away; behold, all things 
are become new," is what the Bible declares. It is 
this fresh start and sparkling clean slate which is 
the true solution for the problem of homosexuality 
or even for the problems of prejudice, greed, and of 
busted relationship. 

It is the goal of myself and other Christians to 
form support groups which will bri ng 
homosexuality out of the closet, not to accept it, but 
rather to encourage peopl in how to d al with and 
overcome the problem of homosexuality. Th 
solution has been around for 2000 years; the 
challenge today is to grab onto that olution 
p rsonally.

US serviceman present at Europe war rally 
continued from page 2 
give the same kind of boost to 
nuclear arms critics that 
dissident soldiers gave to the 
anti·Vietnam War effort. So 
far, while this unlikely hero 
(he only joined the Army two 
years ago after a varied career 
as a would·be actor, "Jesus 
freak," college undergraduate, 
and auctioneer) has become a 
"cause celebre" among 
numerous young Germans, 
the wave of disarmament 
fervor in Europe is only 
beginning to shower its mists 

. of discontent on the United 
States. 

As Bergeron concedes, it's 
also difficult to detect much 
sympathy for the peace 
movement among the other 
Americans stationed with him 
in West Germany. Along with 
the skeptical regard from 
generally conservative, 18· to 
21·year·old enlistees, he says, 
"I get strange and evil looks 
from people who went through 
Vietnam .... They don't like 
this peace movement. They 
see red. They agree with what 
(president) Reagan says about 
it being communist backed ." 

History may indeed be 
repeating itself: Reagan' s 
recent efforts to ascribe 
Western Europe's disarma· 
ment movement to Kremlin 
planners reminds us of similar 
charges against the fledgling 
anti·war effort more than 15 
years ago. 

Yet those who refuse to 
learn from history might see 
that the urge for peace and 
surviva l in Americans 
yesterday and Europeans 
today can pring from the 

human heart, sometimes with 
the militance of war itself. 
Even former Army general and 
now Secretary of State 
Alexander M. Haig has said 

Hubig 

the peace movement involves 
"an objective assessment by 
honest people."

BY MANDY WATERFIELD 
The Committee on Educational 

Pol icy (CEP), has not yet made a 
decision on the issue of whether or not 
the Communications program should 
becme a department. 

According to Lee Anderson, the 
student representative for the CEP, 
the committee decided at last 
Thursday's meeting to break into 
subcommittees that will meet with 
st udents and faculty to discuss the 
issues. The meetings will take place 
March 2 and 9 between 3:00 and 5:00. 
The final decision will be made at the 
beginning of next quarter. 

The CEP's decision will be made on 
the basis of "unsolicited mail from 
faculty and students , historical 
material," and the recommendations 
of the chairs of social science 
departments, says Anderson. 

At a recent CEP meeting, the chairs 
of social science departments who will 
be affected by a decision in 
Communications, were asked to 
testify. According to Anderson, the 
department chairs were generally 
favorable to the proposal. However, 
some criticisms were presented. 

There was concern that the 
argument that 450 Communications 
majors could warrant a department, 
was a poor one. 

There was also some feeling that 
Communications com bines so many 
different disciplines that it cannot be 
incorporated into one coherent field of 
study. David Jordan , chair of the 
Anthropology department, ex pres ed 
concern that Communications may 
not best serve the needs of so many 
diverse student interests. For 
instance, Jordan said, while one 
student may be interested in the 
visual art aspects of communications, 
and another is interested in the 
psychological aspects, both will 
graduate with the same degree but 
different educations. James Lyon, 
chair of the Literature department , 
however, feels that Communications 
is a defined discipline, at least "as 
clearly defined as any of the other 
social sciences were in the early 
stages." Lyon commented that, " If 
there is any other department that can 
do what Communications is doing, I"d 
like to know which one."

ASUCSD begins 
draft council 

BY COLLEEN KELSH 
On February 28, the grace period for 

failure to register for Selective Service 
ran out. This leaves about 50 percent 
of those Californians - males born 
between 1960 and 1963 - who did not 
register, vulnerable to posible federal 
pro ecution. 

Last week, the ASUCSD approved 
funding for a draft coun ellng ervlce 
on campus. Says Lisa Stenmark, an 
AS representative and one of the 
organizers, "the decision whether or 
not to register i a seriou one, and one 
which shouldn't be pas ed off 
lightly," 

Although speculation I that federal 
pro ecution for those failing to 
register is months away (possibly 
beginning in June, when college 
campuses are disbanded ), conse-
quences can be steep for the 
prosecuted: 5 years and/or a $10,000 
fine. "The pre ent admlni tration 
doesn't want to make a fuss," ays 
Stenmark, "they want to scare people 
into registering. They will probably 
give the maximum fine and penalty to 
a few, and hope that this will convince 
the rest to register." 

Although the AS was concerned 
that the draft coun eling would be a 
"decidedly lefti t organization, " 
Stenmark di mi se the concern. 
attributing it to the "myt h that a draft 
counselor is there to convince people 
not to register." She feels the role of 
the draft counselor is one of a "peer 
counselor, who will be able to ask the 
right que tion to help omeone decide 
what they want to do." and ·tres e 
that they are "there to an wer 
que tions, and if nece sary , refer 
them to legal organization (the 
National Lawyers GUild), and 'lOl to 
tell people what to do. " 

"Staying neutral IS a protection not 
only to the draft counselee, but also to 
the draft counselor," ay Stenmark, 
"and if r find out that a counselor is 
pushing people not to register, I'd 
rather have them coun el omewhere 
else." 

" We will start out mall, and if 
there is a lot of demand , we will extend 
our hours. I think there will be a lot of 
interest once we start advertising."

RCC disapproves of boycotts 
BY CATHY ALGARIN 

At a meeting two weeks ago, The 
Revelle College Council (RCC) 
unanimously voted not to support 
the ASUCSD's boycott of Nestle 's 
products, and thus expressed its 
belief that the AS should 
concentrate on campus related 
activities, rather than on national 
Issues_ 

The RCC decision signifies more 
than simple opposition to Nestle 
products_ It expresses the Revelle 
College Council's disapproval of AS 
politics_ "RCC does not support in 
principle, the idea of the AS 
adopting stances to boycott multi-
national corporations," stated Hoyt 
Yee, chairman of RCC_ 

According to Yee, the AS is 
concentrating on issues which are a 
waste of time and energy. "The AS 
seems to tackle huge idealistic 
problems that they have no control 
over. Important issues within their 
control seem to be ignored," said 
Yee_ 

RCC feels that the AS should 
focus its attention on topics which 
are more directly related to UCSD 
students. These include housing, 
tuition and libraries. 

UCSD not a vacuum 
Reggie Williams, AS Commis-

sioner of Student Welfare, stated 
that the AS is not ignoring campus-
related activities. Rather, the AS is 
enlarging its scope of attention. 

"UCSD does not exist in a 
vacuum from the rest of the world. 
We are students, but on a more 
fundamental level we are people 
who can have an impact on 
society," said Williams. 

However, Yee explained that the 
members of RCC believe that 
students are more concerned with 
issues that directly affect them. 
Students, according to the RCC, do 
not seem overly concerned with 
national issues. 

Williams claimed that RCC is 
underestimating the intelligence of 
UCSD students by assuming that 
they have no concern for or 
knowledge of world issues. 
Williams stated, "It is demeaning 
to say that we cannot take a stand." 

Williams accused the Revelle 
College Council of supporting an 
isolationist trend. 

Chairs talk to CEP 
continued from page 5 

Although Lyon said that he was 
"generally in favor" of the proposal. 
he did feel that certain Questions 
should be addressed. He also pointed 
out that departmental stat us creates a -
demand for additional resources. 

There IS considerable speculat ion 

that some departments, such as 
Linguistics, are not utilized enough by 
Communications. Leonard Newmark, 
chair of the Linguistics department, 
refused to comment. Lyon, however, 
described his relationship with 
Communications as "mutually 
ati factory to both parties." 

Flt\IAL EXAMINATIONS 
The Committee on Educational Policy ICEP) 
wishes to remind students and faculty of the 
following rules concerning final 
examinations. 
I. Final examinations are required in all undergraduate 
courses except laboratory courses. 
2. A final examination must, whenever practicable, be 
written and must be completed by all participants 
within a previously announced time limit. 
3. Examinations in non-laboratory courses may not 
exceed three hours' duration. 

4. Although the instructor may give a final 
examination at an alternative time during examination 
week, students must be permitted to take an equivalent 
examination at the originally scheduled time if they so 
desire. 
5. The instructor may not require a "take-home" final 
examination to be turned in before the date and hour at 
which the examination in the course was scheduled by 
the Registrar. 
6_ No student may be excused from assigned final 
examinations. 
7. Rnal examinations may be given neither on the 
Monday of examination week (the "free-day'" nor at 
any time before examination week without explicit 
permission of the CEP. 

Students having questions about the 
application of these rules should see either 
the chair of theIr Instructor's department or 
their college provosts.

Stockwell talks about CIA 
.:onl illlll·d In)ll1 pa~c ~ 
how CIA manuevers escalated the 
Angolan situation, even though it had 
been determined that there was no 
chance of winning. 

He described how the CIA made 
conscious decisions about what to tell 
the American public. "The truth was 
never considered, but just what would 
work for our program," said 

Stockwell. He told how former CIA 
director William Colby lied to a senate 
investigating committee to cover-up 
for CIA activities in Angola . 

Stockwell finally resigned in 1977 
and decided to publicize his charges. 
Stockwell considers the CIA 
anathema and believes that it should 
be disbanded. He characterized the 
agency as a " ecret police ."

Coming to grips with student stress 
BY JOHN SCHINNERER 
A psychosomatic illness is a 

disorder that has its roots in 
the mind . The common 
mistake , however, is to 
assume that psychosomatic 
illnesses cannot do any real 
p,hysical harm, since they are 
'only in one's mind." In fact, 

the very word that describes 
the condition indicates its 
effect on the whole person. 

The word "psychosomatic" 
comes from the Latin roots 
"psyche," meaning mind, and 
"soma," meaning body_ 
Science is only beginning to 
realize the extraordinary 
amount of control that the 
mind has over the physical 
body. At times, t he mind can 
affect the body without any 
conscious control, causing a 
psychosomatic illness. 

Stress can be the cause of 
numerous psychosomatic 
illnesses that start at the 
mental level. The key to 
combatting these maladies 
(many of which are fatniliar to 
students as study burnout, 
insomnia, constant fatigue, 
poor concentration, exam 
panic, frustration, and "the 
blues") is to go back to the 
mind, where the problem 
begins. The greater the stress, 
the more acute these 
"illnesses" will become. To 
reduce or eliminate them, 
mental stress must be 
lessened. 

Students are the victims of 
numerous stress-producing 
agents. One of the most 

common is improper sleep. 
The term "improper" is 
intended to include more than 
just lack of sleep, although 
that is the major factor. 
Normal sleep occurs in cycles 
that start with light sleep, 
during which time dreaming 
takes place, and progresses to 
deeper and deeper levels, with 
a consequent change in brain-
wave activity and drop in 
pulse rate and respiration 
functions. These cycles 
average one and one-half hours 
apiece, and the average 
person's night consists of five 
of them, or seven and one-half 
hours ' sleep. Often people will 
sleep one more or one less sleep 
cycle, nine or six hours 
respectively being their 
normal requirements for 
adequate sleep. 

Waking (perhaps to an 
alarm) in the middle of a deep 
sleep cycle can leave one 
drowsy and vague for a 
substantial amount of time 
afterwards. Likewise, one 
more or one less sleep cycle 
than your body and mind 
prefer will also cause lethargy 
and drowsiness. If you know 
how long you normally sleep 
(how many cycles), you can 
plan to go to bed at an 
appropriate time for a natural 
awakening in time for that 
eight o'clock morning lecture. 
This will provide your body 
and mind with the proper. 
amount of sleep and you with a 
clear head for note-taking. 

Some students work to 

exhaustion. collapse on the 
bed , and then struggle to get 
up early to get to a morning 
class or finish the paper that's 
due by lunchtime. This habit 
leads to s leep during which the 
mind is continually in "deep 
sleep," and the normal cycles 
do not occur. In this state, no 
dreaming takes place, and 
research has shown that in a 
person who normally dreams 
during that phase of the sleep 
cycle, a dreamless night of 
exhausted sleep is not nearly 
as beneficial as a night of 
normal, dreaming sleep. 

The same process occurs 
when drugs such as tranquil-
izers (either prescribed or over-
the-counter) are used to aid 
sleep. They inhibit the normal 
dreaming function, and 
although the length of sleep 
may be adequate, the need for 
dreaming is suppressed. In 
addition, sleeping medications 
lose their effectiveness after 
two or thre weeks, and require 
increased dosages to produce 
drowsiness . This can lead to 
"withdrawal insomnia" when 
one stops using the drugs to 
aid sleep. 

Other stre s-causing factors 
can be relieved in a number of 
ways: one of the easiest is to 
talk about the problem, and let 
your feelings out. Repressed 
emotions and anxieties can 
cause severe stress if they are 
forcefully hidden and kept to 
oneself (the only problem may 
be finding a sympathetic

to you). 

Stress-produci ng agen ts 
often occur at work, or in the 
student's case, when 
studying. When the stress 
factor is not work-related, 
however, work can be helpful 
as a way to get non-work-
related worries and problems 
off of one's mind , as well as 
being constructive academi -
cally. For general stress, 
which has perhaps arisen from 
several different causes, 
especially frustration or 
worry, physical activity is an 
excellent way to release the 
muscle and body tension that 
mental stress can cause. 

On the opposite end of the 
scale, some form of relaxation 
meditation, practiced regular-
ly. can be a positive way to 
cope with stress and tension. 

Cultivating positive habits 
is one of the best ways to 
reduce stress at all levels. 
Proper planning of time use 

and the setting of realistic, 
achievable goals will get rid of 
a lot of worries. A proper 
balance of "work" and " play" 
is important, also. Too much 
of anything can be stressful, 
and taking time off to enjoy life 
can provide necessary 
relaxation. In addi tion , 
something as simple as a 
proper dietary balance will 
enable your body to better cope 
with stressful situations. 

The major decision is where 
to place your priorities. What 
matters most to you: your 
health and well being, or 
straight "A's?" ThIS sort of 
questIOn IS a purely individual 
choice, one each person must 
make for his or herself. 
Logically, it would seem that 
success (grades, money, love. 
career) I something to strive 
for, but at what cost? A person 
who IS successful but seldom 
truly "well" mIght not be all 
that able to enjoy the fruits of 
success. 

((Cancer" genes identified by 
recombinant DNA methods 

Cancer cells are genetically 
abnormal. Each one carries 
within its chromosomes an 
aberrant message to divide. 
When it does, the signal is 
passed on to each daughter 
cell; and on .... 

So much is known. What is 
not is the precise nature of 
these genetic alterations. It is 
not known, for example, 
whether different human 
tumors involve alterations in 
the function or expression of 
many genes, or just a few, or 
perhaps only one. In other 
words, how many different 
ways are there for a cell to 
become malignant? Are there 
such things as "cancer" genes. 
and, if so, how do they work? 

Answers are crucial. The 
ideal cancer therapy would kill 
cancer cells without harming 
normal ones. Clearly. 
radiation and drugs do not 
achieve this; their effective-

ness is limited by the amount 
of normal cell damage a 
patient can tolerate. But an 
understanding of the precise 
genetic and biochemical 
events that direct the 
uncontrolled division of a 
cancer cell could well lead to 
highly specific and potent 
therapeutic strategies. 

While this goal is still 
distant. a series of remarkable 
research findings in the past 
three or four years have 
clearly illuminated a route to 
it. In an explosion of new and 
important discoveries in 
molecular genetics, research-
ers have now identified a 
series of cellular "transform-
ing" genes, genetic elements 
that have the capaci ty to 
convert normal cells to 
malignant ones. 

The discovery of these genes 
was an unanticipated

Virus cell gene hybridization SCIENCE BULLITEN BOARD 
continued fn"\1 pa!!c 7 
outgrowth of recent studies of 
a group of simple viruses that 
cause tumors in laboratory 
animals. In spite of having 
very little genetic material. 
some as few as two or three 
genes. they are powerful 
inducers of cancer. 

The impact of recombinant 
DNA technology on the late 
1970's virtually revolutionized 
the study of tumor viruses. 
With this powerful new tool. 
researchers could, for the first 
time. begin literally to dissect 
the genetic material of tumor 
viruses and identify the single 
viral genes responsible for 
malignant transformation. 

Investigation at the Tumor 
Virology Laboratory (TVL) at 
The Salk Institute has taken a 
leading role in this research. 
To date. about a dozen 
different transforming genes 
have been found among these 
viruses. Each of these genes. 
inserted into a host cell 's 
genetic material by a virus. 
can subvert or alter the cell 's 
biochemical machinery , 
making division its pnmary 
function . 

Remarkably. the function of 
some of these genes is known. 
Drs. Walter Eckhart. Tony 
Hunter and Bartholomew 
Sefton and their colleagues in 
the TVL have shown that 
several of these produce 
enzymes with the same 
unusual activity. Operating 
within an infected cell , these 
enzymes subtly alter a number 
of cellular functions, at least 
one of which triggers 
uncontrolled division. 

This observation led to 

an oth e r ma jor - and 
surprising - dI scovery; 
uninfected cells display this 
same enzymatic activity, 
though at much lower levels. 
That is, a gene or genes 
producing similar enzymes 
must be a normal component 
of cells. The question: Is there 
any similarity between these 
viral and cellular genes? 

Just a few years ago, this 
would have defied experimen· 
tal answers. With recombi· 
nant DNA techniques. 
however, it is not only possible 
but quite straightforward. 
Briefly, the viral transformed 
genes themselves are used as 
probes to detect similar or 
identical genes in cellular 
DNA. 

DNA, the genetic chemi· 
cal. is composed of two slender 
strands made up of subunits 
called nuc1eotides. It i the 
sequence in which different 
nucleotide s are s trung 
together that makes each gene 
fun ctionally separate and 
unique. 

The two DNA s trands are 
held together by weak bonds 
between certain pairs of 
nuc1eotides. In a gene . 
typically some thous ands of 
nucleotides in length , the two 
chains are exactly comple· 
mentary; each nucleotide 
binds to the one oppos ite itand 
t he two s trands are held 
tightl y t oge t her by the 
combined s trength of 
thousands of weak bonds. 
Moreover, if the s trands are 
separated by heat or chemical 
treatment , which breaks these 
bonds, and they allowed to 
reform. the complementary 

strands will come together 
gain in precisely the right way. 

This exact nucleotide 
pairing is the basis of the DNA 
hybridization technique, an 
elegant way to compare viral 
and cellular genes. So, while 
single DNA strands from the 
same or newly identical genes 
will reform tight double 
strands. single strands from 
dissimilar genes will not. In 
this case. there is not enough 
sequence "homology" to hold 
the strands together. 

In the test, radioactive 
single strands from the viral 
transforming genes are 
washed over a surface bearing 
fragments of cellular DNA. If, 
during this process, the viral 
strands encounter highly 
homologous cellular sequen· 
ces, radioactive viral·cellular 
hybrid molecules are formed 
and retained . These are easily 
detected and their presence 
demonstrates that a cellular 
gene very similar to the viral 
gene was present. 

Us ing this technique 
researchers have found that 
each of the known viral 
t ransforming genes has a 
counterpart in animal cells. 

These studies suggest how 
cancers might arise in the 
absence of viruses . Ap· 
parently . these normal genes 
have the potential to 
transform when they escape 
genetic control. Thus, 
mutation ·causing events such 
as industrial chemicals or 
radiation can alter certain 
genetic control mechanisms. 
allowing these . genes to 
function when they ought not 
to.

The classic compositions 
of the late Charles I ves 
Tribute to great 
composer here 

By GORDON HOWARD 
Staff Writer 

Mention the name Charles 
Ives to a European music 
student and the questioner is 
likely to get an indifferent 
shrug, or a reply that the 
composer is quite a bit 
overrated. Ask an American 
musician about Ives and the 
response is quite different, 
notin~ Ives' originality , 
inventIveness, and brilliant 
u se of indigenous folk 
materials. One point would 
come through ; Charles [ves is 
truly an American composer, 
untied to the bonds which 
Eurpeans have genrally held 
on American composers. 

So Wednesday night in 
Mandeville, the Music 
department, specifically an 
undergraduage and graduate 
performance seminar class. 
will offer a program entitled, 
" Hello Charlie ." Various 
lesser· known but nevertheless 
intriguing works by Mr. Ives 
will be presented, under the 
auspices of program director 
and UCSD Music Professor 
Tom Nee. 

Charles I ves was born in 
Connecticutt in 1874. the son 
of a bandleader. Ives' father 
liked to experiment musically 
in quarter· tone mus ic (the 
standard in terval on Western 
musical ins truments is a half· 
tone) and dissonance among 
other things. He encouraged 
his son to experiment as well, 
and had him learn to play the 
organ. Young Charles led a 
normal youthful existence. 
but also spent much time 
s tudying music on his own. He 
played drums in his father's 
band, but shyly refused to play 
in his fir s t composition 
entitled "Holiday Quick-
Step," when his father's band 
played it at a Christmas 
concert. 

At Yale [ves continued his 

Campus Wide 

musical work, producing in 
1891 the "Variations on 
'America'" for organ. An 
adaptation for orchestra has 
made this piece, with its 
interesting and novel 
variations of "My Country 
'Tis of Thee" well known. 
This piece exemplifies a 
common penchant rves had for 
weaving popular American 
ballads, folk tunes, popular 
songs. and religious hymns 
into his works. 

Once graduated , Ives 
became an insurance clerk in 
New York. Starting his own 
firm in 1908, he was very 
s ucce s sful and became 
financially independent of any 
need to make money from his 
music . This was important for 
his parallel vocation in that he 
did not need his music to earn 
his daily bread; he remained 
independent of any tendency 
towards popularizing his 
musical style. Thus he

hi s la s t work In 1926, 
reportedly admitttng dispair 
tngly to hIS wife that his 
musical inspiration was spent. 
T he years until hIS death in 
1954 were spent in almost 
complete isolation on his 
Connect icutt farm, as he 
refused public appearances, 
owned no radio or phonograph, 
and did not subscribe to any 
newspaper. 

Ives published his music at

ance seminar class this week. 

his own expen e in the teens 
and twenties, wit h a sense of 
humor about the lack of 
response it received. In a 
preface to a book of 114 songs 
he published in 1921 he noted , 
"Some have written a book for 
money; I have not. Some for 
fame; I have not. Some for love; 
I have not. In fact I have not 
written a book at all - I have 
merely cleaned house." 

However, in the 1930' his 
Concord Piano Sonata. wi th 
movements entitled to four 

New England transcendental· 
ist. (Emerson, The Alcott s 
Hawthorn e, and 1 horeau), 
gained a wide audIence and his 
mus ical star began to rise. The 
1947 Pulitzer Prize in music 
was given to hi s Third 
Symphony, written in the first 
decade of the century but not 
premiered until 1946. Leonard 
Bern s tei n prem iered the 
Second Symphony five years 
later, to which Ives condes· 
cended to listen to on his 
maid's rad io. 

He did not gain instant 
success, as evidenced by his 
scathi n g dermatological 
denunciation of large 
recording companie . "91 and 
3/ 10% (I like to be precise) of all 
radio and phonograph records 
are sebaciou cy t , and soft 
ones at that ."

Stokowski took on Ives Fourth 
Symphony in 1965 after

putting together the Fourth 
movement from fragments 
and near -undeCIpherable 
notes. He noted that the piece, 
which included two orchestras

Mandeville exhibit offers an 
exciting display of L.A. art 

By DAVID FLAUM 
Slaff Write r 

Tucked away down a half 
flight of steps, the Mandeville 
Art Gallery is currentl y 
hostmg an original collection 
of Contemporary art entitled 
Five From L.A. Composed of 
everything from installation 
to abstracts, this small exhibit 
displays some fa sci nating 
forms of artistic expression. 

The five are:' 
Mary Jones, Michael 
Kelly , Kiki Mac-
Minnis, Michael 
McMillen and Jeff· 
rey Valance. And, as 
the title of the 
exhibit indicates, 
each is from Los 
Angeles. 

a familiar pose, while in 
several other drawings, she 
corn bines the use of charcoal 
with color to give her city 
structures that worn and 
gTitty look. 

An installation by McMillen 
entitled "Nightscape" is every 
bit as exotic as the title 
implies. Constructed especial· 
ly for UCSD, the ins tallation is 
enclosed within a mysterious· 

animals. His painting'collages 
deal mostly with aircrafts that 
shoot and drop bombs. These 
fighting planes are especially 
impressive in their decora· 
tions, decals of slars and 
stripes that used to accomp-
any model ai rplane kits . 
Valence has also constructed 
" C - 82 ," an ' electrical 
apparatu s built into a 
converted army footlocker. 

In Kelley's corner 
of the exhibit rests 
an interest ing assor· 
tment of objects and 
paintings with an 
emphasis on frogs . 
Photographs and 
titles accompany 
part of the exhibit 
which, along with 
the explanations, 
must be examined 
to understand Kel· 
ley's message. 

Both female ar· 
tists, Jones and 
MacMinnis, con · 
cern themselves 
with urban sub· 
jects, though in 
different sty les. 
J ones. in her large 
abstracts, takes 
advantage of vi· 
brant colors and 
geometric shapes to 

"Savannah" by Los Angeles artist Mary Jones 

Each of the artists 
in this exhibit 
reveals an influence 
of society, of Los 
Angeles in all its 
progress and tech· 
nology. Their ima· 

produce her paintings. In 
several of them, a luminous 
lightning bolt flashes across 
the canvas as well. In "Open" 
she isolates these elements 
against a dark background • 
giving the impression of a 
flourescent sign in downtown 
Los Angeles. 

Maclnnis assumes a more 
representational approach 
than Jones. Her soft pastels 
portray the various structures 
of city bridges and highways, 
with automobiles zipping 
along them. A characteristic 
Hollywood palm tree in 
"Under the Overpass" strikes 

ly darkened room. Leaves, 
rocks, and other assorted 
debris crackle beneath the 
viewer as he enters. 
Ultimately, the viewer is led to 
the blinking red numbers of a 
console time piece that 
illuminates a viewfinder - the 
view is McMillen's own 
inspiration. 

Jeffrey Valance examines 
progress largely within a 
miliraty context. He, too, has 
created a type of installation 
by integrating his wall 
painting'collages with loose 
charcoal drawings of reptiles, 
roden ts, dogs and ot h er 

P.D.Q.Bachconcert: 
a musical variety 

BY DARIN JOHNSON 
P.D.Q. Bach struck again at 

UCSD, delighting his loyal 
fans and shocking those who 
came, thinking that the 
program had something to do 
with the great Johann 
Sebastian Bach. Most of these, 
however, were kept from 
leaving due to hysterical fits of 
laughing. Those of us who did 
know what was going on did 
likewise. 

P.D.Q. Bach, supposedly the 
thirteenth son ofJ.S. Bach, has 
been extensively researched 
by Professor Peter Schickele. 
The professor presented a 
variety of P.D.Q. Bach' s 
'music' and also gave a slide 
show and lecture on the life 
and career of P.D.Q. Bach. 

The Professor was almost 
late for the performance, but 
arrived in time, hurrying in 
after swinging down from the 
ceiling on a rope. Jumping 
right in, he presented 
"Abassonata" a duet for piano 
and bassoon. Since the pianist 
was a bit late also, it became a 
solo for piano and bassoon, 
bringing hysterics from the 
audience and pulled muscles 
from Professor Schickele. 
Professor Schickele comment· 
ed that although there was no 
basis to the fact, the bassoon 
sounds very much like a 
P.D.Q. Bach invention. 

The next musical number, 
" Twelve Quite Heavenly 
Songs (Arie Proprio Zodt· 
acle)," was su ng by Professor 

Schickele and the famous 
bargain·counter tenor, John 
Ferrante. They were accompa· 
nied on the piano, harpsichord , 
chord-organ, and chamber 
calliope by David Oei, who has 
a black belt in piano. Various 
songs loosely based on the 
zodiac were presented with 
such odd lyrics as 'Virginia, 
they called her virgin for 
short , ... but not for long.' 

Next presented was .. 
'Goldbrick' Variations." The 
variations were presented first 
because, as even P.D.Q. Bach 
knew if the audience heard the 
main theme they wou ldn 't 
stay for the rest of the piece. 
Various explosions were well 
placed throughout this piece, 
often putting the auditorium 
in total darkness while the 
music played on. 

Finally , the last piece 
arrived, " Hansel and Gretel 
and Fred and Alice." an opera 
in one unnatural act. Neither 
the word 'opera' nor the title 
reflected any part of the piece. 

Professor Schickele called 
P.D.Q. Bach the most original 
composer to pass this way ... or 
out. He regretted that his 
music could not be played as he 
intended it to be heard, if 
indeed he had intended it to be. 

P,D.Q. Bach's music was 
profoundly shallow, but it did 
not detract from the 
audience's enjoyment of the 
concert. 

ges of the modern 
world are exciting and 
energetic. The message is 
clear. The art of the Five is 
alive. 

The exhibit Five From L.A. 
will be on display through 
March 14. Admission is free.

Tribute to 
Ives Wed. 
continued from page 11 
sets of chimes and several 
trumpets and trombones in a 
reputedly very original 
mixture. Piano music includes 
a piece entitled, "Some 
Southpaw Pitching." as well 
as two works for pianos 
specially tuned to quarter· tone 
intervals. 

Nee characterized what 
makes Ives so special as a 
peculiarly American style. 
"Much of the music is rough, 
not as polished as it cou ld be, 
perhaps gritty, but all the 
more interesting because of it. 
It's so far ahead of its time as 
to seem almost in a class by 
itself; it doesn't fit into any 
mold or school of composers 
and compositions." Perhaps it 
took the coming of more 
modern music to the scene for 
rves to be fully appreciated, 
but nevertheless his music 
stands up to time and its 
successor compositions very 
well. 

Most attending this concert 
will have heard none of these 
pieces before. and concert· 
goers should expect an 
interesting and pleasurable 
evening getting to know the 
mu s ic of this uniquely 
American composer. He is 
someone to proudly wave the 
flag for. As one perceptive 
European, composer Arnold 
Schoenberg, put it in a 
recen tly·discovered notebook, 
"There is a great man livingin 
this country, a composer. He 
has s olved the problem of how 
to preserve one's self and to 
learn. He responds to neglect 
with contempt. He is not 
forced to accept praise or 
blame. His name is Ives." 

Admission is free, and the 
show starts at 8 p.m. For

Men rally to defeat Redlands 
Tennis coach labels it 'greatest victory ever' 

BYPAULAMBROGIO 
Stall Writer 

After losing their first four 
singles matches against 
Redlands Saturday, the men's 
tennis team would have lost 
the contest with another 
defeat. Following his dropping 
the first set and being behind 
in a second set tie· breaker with 
the entire match resting on the 
next couple of points, Dave 
Taber pulled even with 
Redland player Rich Fredrick. 
However, on the next point he 
slipped charging the net, and 
slammed his knee into the 
court. Despite a heavy limp, 
the courageous. determined 
Taber captured the second set, 
and went on to dominate the 
third. 

A singles victory for Triton 
Mike Fahlbausch put the score 
at 4·2 Redlands, with the 
doubles action to follow. 

Fahlbausch added. "They're 
really tough in the doubles." 
However. Dave Sider and 
Peter Wood captured the 
opening doubles match, while 
Eugene Jones and Everett Gee 
took the second . At four 
matches apiece the burden fell 
on Taber and Larry Alie. They 
responded with a 6-4. 7-5 
triumph to clinch the victory. 

Coach Peter Davis later 
commented, "Taber's winning 
rally in the tIe· breaker was the 
biggest point in the match." 
Since the Tritons have never 
defeated Redlands before. and 
because this is the team they 
probably will face in the 
district championship, coach 
Davis explained, "This was 
the greatest victory we (have) 
ever had ." 

In smgles action, freshman 
Fahlbausch outgunned Jeff 
Bubnack 3·6, 6-3, 6·4 in a 

highly emotional match. 
Powertul serving, fierce net 
play, and rut hless overheads 
caused short, explosive rallies 
in thi exciting match . 

In the doubles, great 
teamwork and aggressive 
volleys by Wood and Sider 
enabled the twosome to 
overcome Michelson and 
Godfrey in straight sets. With 
both teams playing the net , at 
times standin~ only five feet 
apart, amazing machine gun 
volleys were common. With 
almost no time to react. Sider 
and Wood repeatedly returned 
shots in self·defense, 
slamming the ball at their 
intimidated opponents. 

With Gee outrunning the 
deep lobs and leaping all over 
the court while Jones volleyed 
skillfully, the tandem secured 
a 7·5, 6-4 much needed 
triumph. 

Tritons stall and stall, but 
conclusion is inevitable 

BY BOB McSPADDEN 
Senior Staff Writer 

It was quite an interesting 
evening last Thursday for the 
UCS D men's basketball 
squad . who took their 5·8 
record into the NAIA Southern 
Division playoffs against the 
top national team, controlled 
the game with a stalled 
offense, ana in the end came up 
short by only eight points, 51· 
43. 

The Biola Eagles are 
definitely a class team. They 
remain the only unbeaten 
squad in the country; they 
placed all five starters on the 
All-Northern League team, 
and they are favorites among 
many to win the entire NAIA 
championship this year in 
Kansas City. But all of that 
taken into account before a 
packed house of home fans 
who have watched the Eagles 
capture league titles for two 
years straight, they were 
teased with the Triton offense. 

"We decided to just lay back 
and let them come at us," said 
Biola guard Rich Cundall after 

UCSD kept possession of the 
ball for the first eleven 
minutes of the second half. 
The Tritons, who were down 
27·18 at halftime, played catch 
with the leather in order to 
whittle the clock down and 
take the momentum away 
from a strong Biola offense. 

The plan caused havoc for 
nine hundred fans who shelled 
out two bucks to see the 
opening round of playoff 
action. The visitors were not 
to leave without seeing some 
very outlandish heckling. At 
one point, two Biolans 
removed their shoes and 
started playing their own 
game of catch on the sidelines, 
while the remainder of the 
crowd joined together in a 
chorus of "Goodbye,goodbye." 

The unrest did not disturb 
the efforts of Triton point 
guard Bob Goodman, who 
operated with the ball until 
8:45 before feeding inside to 
Mike Dabasinskas for the 
layup. 

The Eagle lead was trimmed 
even further. when 7'8"

fouled the senior eight times in 
order to regain possession. Bell 
dropped only 4 of his sixteen 
freethrows. left the game 
disenchanted. and allowed his 
teammates to absorb the 
remaining time. 

"We expected them to come 
out with a different offen e. I 
would have done the same 
thing in their position and they 
executed it very well," 
commented co-head coach 
Dave Lyon for Biola after the 
contest. "The game would 
have been much different if we 
hit our freethrows," he added . 

The single elimination 
tournament left UCSD with 
an overall record of 10·16 for 
the year. Tom Wight, 'a very

scoring record for the Tritons 
this year, led all scorers with 
18 points. The only other

Women go out in style 
BY JIM SCHUTZ 

Slaff Writer 
Going in style. Everyone wants to leave with their heads high 

and their pride still intact. The UCSD women 's basketball team 
is no exception; they finished their regular season play in style. 
by blowing out Loyola Marymount University, 76·67. 

The last game of the season always means something to the 
coach. players, and even fans. San Diegans can't wait for the 
Clippers "New Era" to end and for someone to take the owner's 
face off the city buses. Obviously , this game meant a lot to the 
Tritons. "This was our best game of the season," head coach 
Judy Malone said. "The whole team wanted thi win so badly. It 
was a great team effort." 

Malone, the only college basketball coach in the country 
without a three·piece suit, started her four departing senior ball 
players - Jill Keene, Stacey McFadden. Mary Egan, Wendy 
Freed. and freshman Paulette Parker. All scored in double digit . 
Keene had 14. McFadden 10, Egan 10, Freed 12, and Parker with 
14. "The score didn't even reflect the tempo of the game," 
Malone said. "We really blew them out." 

The first time the Tritons met Loyola. LMU ent the women 
on a long bus ride home and a twelve point loss. With a final 
record of 9·19, the Triton season was "100 percent better than 
last season" where they finished 8-19, Malone said. 

This '82 season had all of the unity of oil and vinegar. You 
really had to shake them up to be any good. So, we ay goodbye to 
all of the departing eniors, say goodbye to the Parker·Freed 
tandem, ay goodbye to the '82 season, but ay hello to the long 
preparation for the '83 season.

Sea Deucers: a great Baseball reverses losing streak 
way to explore the sea 

BY LARRY GOLDMAN 
Staff Writer 

This is the second in a series of articles exploring UCSD Recreation 
Department clu~. 

Any diver at UCSD should 
know about the UCSD scuba 
club, better known as Sea 
Deucers. The club was formed 
in 1967 making it, along with 
the outing and soccer clubs, 
one of the most stable on 
campus. It was originally a 
snorkeling club but officially 
became a scuba club in 1970. 

The origin of the name Sea 
Deucers is quite interesting. It 
was in the late sixties when 
the peace sign was prevalent. 
Divers in the club when 
underwater would. instead of 
flashing the o.k. sign , flash the 
peace sign. These two fingers 
were a deuce. thus Sea 
Deucers. 

All divers must be certified 
and, unfortunately, beginning 
certification classes aren't 
offered through this campus. 
One can become certified 
easily though through classes 
offered at the Mission Bay 
Aquatic Center. 

The club consists of about 
200 members and dues are $5 
per quarter . Along with 
members hip come many 
advantages, mainly the 
opportunity to go on dives. 
There are dives every weekend 
and even some on weekdays. 
Other advantages inc lude 
access to limited equipment 
rental through the club, where 
it costs $5 per quarter to rent a 
tank. Also many dive shops 
give discounts or free air to the 
Sea Deucers. 

The dives are all run by 
divemasters, experienced 
divers who have completed all 
of Bert Kobaya hi's, the head 

of the club, P.E. advanced 
diving courses. The dive-
masters are responsible for 
producing the schedule of 
dives for each quarter and 
making sure that all dives are 
safe and the equipment is 
correct. The divemaster 
knows how to say "no dive" if 
conditions are bad. 

In the history of the scuba 
club there has not been one 
fatality or even a close call. 
This can be compared to many 
other campuses which have 
had deaths in their clubs. 
Kobayashi said, "this club has 
been very fortunate and 
conscious about s afety 
procedures. " 

The club's expenses run 
between $10,000 and $15,000 a 
year which includes upkeep on 
their 3 inflatable boats, one of 
which is a 20-foot Zodiac Mark 
V that was donated by Scripps. 
They cover their expenses 
through dues, fund raisers like 
the underwater film festival , 
direct fees for certain trips and 
a few donations. 

The club consists primarily 
of undergraduate but does 
have some faculty and grad 
student members. According 
to Kobayashi the goal of the 
club is to have divers , when 
they leave UCSD, "be safe for 
them elves." 

Why dive?Forone, the ocean 
is a good escape - a place 
relatively untouched by man. 
Secondly. divers eat well with 
freezers always full of abalone. 
At $20 a pound eating abalone 
4 times a week makes a diver 
feel rich even if s/ he is not. 

The Emergence of the 
WOl'Id Teacher 

Since July 19, 1977, the great spiritual teacher awaited by all 
religions under various names has been living among us. He is 
presently emerging from a well-known country of the modern 
world into full public work. By the Spring of 1982, He will appeal 
directly to all humanity to implement the principles of Sharing, 
Justice and Brotherhood. If you can accept this even as a

Keith Yokomoto just can't seem to get it 

right. As a starting Triton baseball pitcher, he 
is credited with three of the team's five losses, 
and has yet to record a win (the team has won 
four). Against UCLA, Yokomoto held the 
Bruins , who eventually scored 17 runs, for the 
first two innings, allowing his team to assume 
an early 1-0 lead. Against Occidental , he 
pitched a complete game, giving up just one hit, 
a lead-off homer in the first inning. He lost that 
one, 1-0. And finally, opposing La Verne in the 
first game of a double-header Saturday, he went 
the route to surrender only four hits, but lost 2-
1. 

taking two out of three, beating Pomona Friday, 
and La Verne Saturday. Against La Verne, they 
scored a season-high ten runs, outhitting their 
opponents 9-8. ' 

Opposing Pomona, the coach referred to his 
squad's performance as "the Mike Brown, 
Mitch Rieder story." 

Mike Brown, primarily a catcher, threw a 
brilliant shut-out, recording an incredible 13 
strikeouts, and walking only one. Brown also 
drove in two runs in a pinch-hit role, as the 
Tritons managed a 6-0 win. 

The second half of the story was Mitch 
Rieder, who collected three hits, including a 
double. Rieder also produced two hits in the 
second game. 

"We're becoming superstitious about him," 
claims coach Lyle Yates, who becomes almost 
somber when talking about his pitcher. "We're 
thinking about changing the number on his 
uniform." 

Yates distributed praise among many of his 
players for their weekend performance but 
recognizes that the main overall improvement 
was in the team's run-production and pitching.

coach. "We came to play ball this time," he 

Although the luckless Yokomoto may be 
about ready to come apart, the team is pulling 
itself back together. After dropping four in a 
row, the Tritons rebounded this weekend by says. 

Women win league opener 
BY JOE FALLETTA 

Staff Writer 
Rita Uribe hurled a three-hit 

gem Friday, As UC San 
Diego's Triton women shut 
out Loyola Marymount, 6-0. 
The opposition was no threat, 
as only two runners were 
allowed as far as third base, 
and Uribe struck out four and 
walked one. Coach Dan 
Monteverde noted the score 
should have been closer to 10-0 
but for three base running 
miscues, and a Marymount 
triple play. 

"We had more than enough 
chances to score the 10, but we 
had three runners thrown out 
trying to score around third ," 
he said . 

Figuring in UC's even hit 
attack was Uribe, who lead off 
the second with a stand up 
double. Bonnie Betz singled 
her to third and Dawn Polk 
scored Uribe on a sacrifice 
bunt.

big win is the first in three

first two contests were pre-

stands 1-0 in Div. III play.

"Overall, I'm extremely 
happy," he said. "Offensively 
and defensively we over-
powered them." 

Monteverde explained that 

Bad times 
for V-ball 

The UCSD men 's volleyball 
team absorbed two losses this 
past weeke nd. one to 
nationally ranked USC Friday 
nIght. and one to a surprising-
ly strong Cal Poly-San Louis 
Obisoo quad Saturday night. 

the win is the first of 11 steps 
the team must successfully 
complete on the way to the 
national championships. 
Included are two games with 
three teams in the division , 
another two with Whittier 
College, one with the 
University of Redlands and 
two with usn, a Div. I club. 

His emotional high Friday 
was tempered though with 
news that three of his players 
may become ineligible due to 
scho la s tic reasons . He 
explained UCSD requires 
sport s players to maintain a 
Grade Point Average (GPA) of 
2.0 and carry 12 units. As the 
workload becomes too heavy, 
though, the player has a choice 
of either sticking it out and 
dropping the GPA or dropping 
a class and falling below the 
required 12 units. 

He says he will know this 
week whether or not he will 
have three fewer players until 
the spring.
