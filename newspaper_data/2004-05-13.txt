University reaches agreement 
with governor on budget 
ByUSAMAK 

Senior Staff Writer 

Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, 
UC President Robert C. Dynes 
and CSU Chancellor Charles B. 
Reed announced a multi-year 
"compact" agreement outlining 
state funding levels and institution-
al accountability measures for the 
UC and CSU systems on May 11. 
The agreement, which will extend 
through the 2010-11 fiscal year, 
sets undergraduate fee increases at 
14 percent and graduate fee 
increases at 20 percent for 2004-05. 

Over the past four years, the 
UC system has absorbed a 16-per-
cent reduction in state funding 
while experiencing a 16-percent 
increase in student enrollment. 

"Mer years of deep budget cuts 
with no end in sight, this compact 
brings the promise of renewed fiscal 
stability for public universities in 
California," Dynes said in a May 11 
statement "Under the compact, UC 
will receive funding to ... sustain its 

deep impaCt on economy, health and 
quality of life of California." 

Although the compact main-
tains that undergraduate fee 
increases will average about 10 per-
cent over the next three years, fees 
will increase by an additional 8 per-
cent in 2005-06 and 2006-07 . 
Graduate students will experience a 
fee increase of 10 peu:ent.in 2006-
2007. Plans for professional stu-
dent fees have yet to be developed. 

The plans for gradual fee 
increases have raised objections 
from student leaders.

Friends, family and members of 
-the UCSD community gathered at 
Price Center Plaza on May 10 to 
mourn the loss and celebrate the 
life of Sixth College freshman 
Daniel Lee Cho. Cho was reported 
missing after swimming at La Jolla 
Shores beach on April 14 and has 
not been fowtd. The candlelight 
vigil attracted over 100 people and 
featured short speeches by those 
dOle to Cho and his family. 

The ceremony commenced 
with a short introduction by Mark 
Chun, the pastor of Jesus 
Conununity Church. 

"It's hard to get any closure," 
Chun said. "I remember Daniel 
having such concern for his 
friends. I remember him as one 
who really loved people around 
him, and all of us are better know-
ing him ... knowing Daniel, we've 
gained something." 

Mark Quan, campus minister 

"How is this an acceptable solu-
tion for students who are going to 
be paying more for undergraduate 
education than was proposed in the 
January budget?" UC Student 
Association Chair Matt Kaczmarek 
said in a May II statement. "How is 
it a solution when graduate and pro-
fessional education is going to cost 
more over the next three years than 
the budget proposed? TIlls is not a 
solution, but rather a selJ-out."

Despite comprising nearly 60 
percent of admitted students for 
2004, female students have low 
enrollment counts in technical 
fieds of study, according to data 
from the Office of the Registrar 
released in spring quarter. 

Statistics show that women 
continue to be especially under-
represented in comparison to 
overall campus numbers in science 
and engineering majors. The data 
also suggests that, compared to 
enrollment numbers from 2000, 
disparity among the genders in 
many of these fields is on the rise. 

Some of the technical fields with 
the most gender disparity include 
bioengineering, structural engineer-
ing, mechanical/aerospace engineer-

UCSD engineers honored for 
help in Bay Bridge design 
Jacobs School of Engineering Dean Frieder 

Seible and strudural engineering professor 
Chia-Ming Uang will be awarded for their contri-
bution to the new San Francisco-Oakland Bay 
Bridge. The two authored a paper which 
describes research to improve welding details 
on the self-anchored suspension bridge cur-
rently being constructed to replace the San 
Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge East Span. The 
2004 Leon S. Moisseiff Award will be given by 
the American Society of Civil Engineering on 
May 25 at the 2004 Strudures Congress and 
Exposition in Nashville, Tenn. 

Seible and Uang. both UCSD alumni, used 
large-scale testing to reveal unexpected and pre-
viously unobserved brittle failure. The engineers 
also used element analysis to demonstrate ways 
to avoid high-stress concentration points, 
research that can be of use to the new bridge's 
construction. The existing bridge was damaged 
during the Lama Prieta earthquake in 1989. 

In 2001, researchers from the Jacobs 
School of Engineering tested structural ele-
ments in the main tower supporting the new 
suspension bridge. The self-anchored suspen-
sion bridge's main tower was buin based on 
concepts developed by Seible. The new bridge 
is designed to withstand high magnitude earth-
quakes. The large-sized linkS, whiCh have never 
been used for bridges before, are designed to 
stiffen the tower and prevent it from swaying 
excessively during earthquakes. Any damage to 
the links would be quick to replace without sig-
nificant repairs to the entire structure.

THURSDAY, MAY 13. 2004 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Watson opposes efforts to put 
. Triton Taxi waiver online 

By InAN TSAO 
Associate News Editor 

Attempts by the A.S. Council 
to incorporate a Triton Taxi 
waiver into the new StudentLink 
porta I have remai ned u nsuccess-
ful. Vice Chancellor of Student 
MfairsJoseph W. Watson oppos-
es placing the waiver online, ci t-
ing safety concerns. 

Currendy, students wishing to 
sign up for the service must fill 
Out a waiver and obtain a sticker 
at the A.S. offices on the third 
floor of Price Center. 

Former Thurgood Marshall 
College Chair Travis Silva, a pro-
ponent of me program, believes 
that having the waiver online and 
easily accessible would help 
improve student safety. 

"The [friton Taxi) program is 
a very important one, and having 
it visible is leey to encouraging 
people to sign up for Triton Taxi 
and use it when they need to," 
Silva said. "It has the potential to 
help students who can't get mem-
selves out of whatever bad situa-
tion mey might find themselves 
in. Possibilities range from 
uncomfortable sexual situations, 
failure of a desi gnated driver to 
hold up their bargain, or a free 
ride in case of a lost or stolen wal-
let." 

Watson said he does not 
believe that me Triton Taxi pro-
gram should be affiliated with 
the UCSD administration, and 
raised con~erns regarding the 
effect of me Triton Taxi program . 
on students. 

"I don't think [Triton Taxi is] a 
type of activi ty tha t shoul d be for-

ma��y associated with the universi-
ty's administrative operations," 

Watson said. "There are a number 
of activities mat lots of people 
have an interest in doing, but do 
not advance the welfare of stu-
dents. [friton Taxi) is not a safety 
program. It is a program to facili-
tate me consumption of alcohol. It 
is a program that encourages and 
facilitates students getting into 
circumstances in which they are 
not safe. This is a service to 
extract them." 

As ~n alternative to Triton 
Taxi, Watson called for more 
programs to improve student 
safety through education. 
Watson also believes that in 
order to be effective, any safety 
programs would need to be avail-
able to students at all times. Due 
to funding constraints, Triton 
Taxi is available from 11 p.m. to 
3 a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays. 

The A.S. Council recently 
reallocated S6,809 to keep me 
program running mrough the 
end of the quarter due to an 
unforeseen rise in the service's 
use. 

"I think me safety of students 
is important and 1 think that mis 
institution, including the 
[Associated Students], should be 
advising students on how to be 
safe and secure," Watson said. 

. "Such advice should cover a full 
range of circumstances that 
could cover a full range of geo-
graphic areas and the full range 
of the wetk. Safety programs 
should not just be functioning 
during [part of) the week. That 
should be me hallmark of a safe-
ty program." 

During fall quarter, me AS. 
Cowlcil was approached by Mesa 
Distributing company, which 
offered potential sponsorship 

deals with companies such as 
Coors Brewing company or Miller 
Brewing company that could have 
been used to help fund me Triton 
Taxi program. 

According to former A.S. 
Commissioner of Student 
Services Kelly Vasant, the deal was 
potentially worth $10,000, but 
was rejected due to the adminis-
tration's concerns. 

"My adviser at the time, Paul 
DeWine, and I spoke wim differ-
ent people at UCSD," Vasant said. 
"The council was really for it. 
However, from me administra-
tion's point of view, getting spon-
sorships from alcohol companies 
was not a good idea, so it kind of 
stopped there ." 

Vasant also believes that me 
times Triton Taxi runs are suffi-
cient, but that geographic cover-
age could be improved. 

"1 think the time that we use it 
is great," Vasant said. "I don't 
think we need to extend it. As for 
coverage, this year we lost me 
ability to go to me Mexican bor-
der, but if we were able to get 
more funding, mat is something 
that we might do." 

Earl Warren College sopho-
more Marianne Samonte believes 
mat me Triton Taxi program is 
useful, but that more infonnation 
about the program needs to be 
available. 

"On the weekend, if I don't 
know how late I'm going to stay 
out, it's good to have Triton Taxi 
as a baclrup," Samonte said. "But 
one time, on a Thursday, we 
missed me bus, so we called 
Triton Taxi and they wanted 
money for it .. _ and we figured out 
mat mey only [ran for freel on 
weekends."

The judicial board can 
help those hurt by A.S. 
So-called "activist" judges legislate from the bench. They have 
been credited with' e tab-
Ii hing the Miranda rights, 
leg,dizing gay marriage in 

fnssachusetts, and creating 
the constitutional right to 
privacy. UCSD's A.S. 
Judicial Board - the little-
known and seldom-used 
judicial branch of our 
undergraduate student gov-
ernment - has simifarly 
far-reaching power over 
matters regarding the A.S. 
Council. Within UCSD, 
the power exercised by trus 
activist board can benefit 
the average student more 
than most may realize. 

The .S. Judicial Board 
ha heard as many cases in 
the last four weeks as it has 
in the previous two years. 
Its recent verdicts; decided 
through hearings between 
registered student organiza-
tion and Associated 

tudents, have been reason-
able and just. In each case, 
the judicial board enforced 
a faIr compromise between 
the two parties. In both 
cases, the student organiza-
tion emerged a little better 
off than it would have been 
if it had not taken 
As ociated Students to trial. 

The A.S. Council sus-
pected Future and Finances 
C lub President Bryan 
Barton of profiting from the 
use of A.S. funds to publish 
the Smdellt Job Guide, and 
subsequently removed 
funding from his publica-
tion - reversi ng their earli-
er decision to fund it. A dis-
gruntled Barton filed a 
compla int with the judicial 
board, which ruled in his 
favor - with a set of condi-
tions that included dictating 
future content of the 
StlldentJob Guide and estab-
lishing new rules for adver-
tising in the publication, 
Although the conditions 
were restrictive, the Future 
and Finances Club at least 
has the chance to comply 
and receive its funds: H ad 
they continued to lobby an 
unresponsive A.S. Council, 
the club would most likely 
have completely lost out. 

The second case involved 
the DJs and Vinylphiles 
Club's exclusion from per-
forming at the A.s.-spon-
so red spring all-ca mpus 

dance. A strong chance of 
rain had convinced the 
dance organizers to sca le 
back the event and move 
the dance from Price 
Center Plaza into the ball-
room. Although the board's 
deci ion favored Associated 
Students, it did ask the stu-
dent government to write a 
letter of apology and to 
draft new legislation to 
address inclement weather 
conditions, The DVC did-

These same opportuni-
ties for redressing griev-
ances are avai lable to all stu-
dents and all student orga-
nizations, Any undergradu-
ate can file a complaint with 
the judicial board, asking 
that anr action of the AS. 
Counci be declared a viola-
tion of the A.S. 
Constitution or bylaws, be 
it a resolution, the Master 
Space Agreement with the 
co-ops, a political rally or 
appointments of represen-
tatives to committees. 

The judicial board's 
power extends even beyond 
constitution or bylaw viola-
tions to cover any "inappro-
priate" action taken by the 
student government. For 
example, III its written opin-
ion from the Future and 
Finances Club case, the 
board glossed over any con-
stitutional justification for 
its ruling, and instead 
focused on logic and fair-
ness, 

When the A.S. Council 
becomes too in,sular or 
political, caring more about 
Its own internal politics 
than the good of the stu-
dents, undergraduates can 
seek relief from thej'udicial 
board. The A.S. udicial 
Board was not elected 
through slate politics, and 
its members are not indebt-
ed to special interest groups 
for theIr positions. They are 
a branch of the student gov-
ernment with authority 
equivalent to that of the 
A.S. Council - and an 
important check on the 
council's power. A.S ,

Presidential candidates take centrist 
approaches to education reform 

ByCLAlIE1VANNmE 
Senior Staff Writer 

In a heartening sign that this 
year's electioneering may avoid 
being cQmpletely dominated by 
talk of outsourcing and nation-
building, both President George 
W Bush and Democratic presi-
dential candidate John Kerry have 
been addressing the all-important 
issue of education recently. Their 
proposals merit examination, as 
they each have elements of 
promise, but also troubling flaws. 

Bush's record on education 
includes the conception and pas-
sage of the landmark No Child 
Left Behind Act, which is the first 
comprehensive federal ' program 
we've seen in years that targets at 
eliminating the achievement gap, 
or the appalling Ilivide between the 
education received by well-olf stu-
dents from affluent school districts 
and that afforded to low-income 
students, specifically targeting 
improvement in achievement for 
blacks, Latinos and American 
Indians. 

No Child Left Behind is ambi-
tious, discomfiting and conrrm'er-
sial. It asks schools to raise the 
achievement of all groups of stu-
dents, including special education 
students and English language 
learners, and threatens schools 
with student rransfers and state 
takeovers if success is not realized. 

Many have issued cries of dis-
may over No Child Left Behind, 
compl aining that it labels under-
perfonning schools "failures" anti 

orders teachers around as if they 
were automatons. Well, wake up: 
Many of Americas schools 1m fail-
ures. They're failing to educate a 
significant portion of their stu-
dents, dooming them to poor job 
opportunities and poverty. 

The legitimate objections to 
the No Child Left Behind Act 
liesin diffe.ring conceptions of what 
constitutes a useful education. 
Supporters are those who would 
have all students demonstrate mas-
tery of core subjects such as basic 
math and reading comprehension. 
They see the usefulness in bub-
bled-in exams and argue that these 
tests are the only way to make sure 
all students get the same crucial 
skills. 

On the other hand are those 
who believe, like William Butler 
Yeats, that "education is not filling 
a bucket, but lighting afire." In 
other words, it is more important 
that schools inspire students with a 
love of learning and critical think-
ing skills, than train them to regur-
gitate rote formulas and facts on 
standardized tests, They complain 
that creative, thought-provoking 
assignments are ditched in favor of 
test preparation. 

The two are not mutually 
exclusive, of course, given enough 
resources and money. Amazing 
results are being realized at schools 
whose programs use common-
sense tactics like increased instruc-
tional time and smaller class sizes. 
These programs, like the 
Knowledge is Power Program, 
have time to teach their students 

the basics they need to ace stan-
dardized tesl'i, and the inspiring, 
creative exercises we all fondly 
remember from ~hool: science 
labs, field trips, research projects. 

TIlls is where No ChlId Left 
Behind is lacking. Schools cannot 
be expected to improve through 
threats alone. There must be 
money for improved facilities, suf-
ficient school supplies, qualified 
reachers, more teachers, ~eachers' 
aides, extracurricular activities, 
community-building exercises -
you get the idea. Excellence does-
n't come cheap. But if America's 
economy is to stay afloat, we're 
going to have to keep the infonna-
tion economy grinding forward 
with a highly educated workforce, 
and we're going to have to make 
sure we're not missing out on 
potentially great studenl'i whose 
ability and intelligence are wasted 
in terrible inner-city and rural 
schools. We can accept nothing 
less than excellence from our pub-
lic schools and have to be willing to 
make the investment. 

So Bush succeeds in demanding 
rigorous standards and account-
ability, but fails to provide the 
monetary support to make these 
standards reachable for all schools 
and studenl'i. What about Kerry? 

Kerry has had momen~ of bril-
liance and unparalleled idiocy in 
addressing the education issue, On 
the moronic side, he's stated his 
support for legislation that would 
deny driver's licenses to high

EdWu 

B efore becoming a much-reviled columnist, this writer had a previous life as a secre-
tary at UCSD Student Affairs 
Development, serving a cheerful and 
capable man named Brian Daly, 
whose noble task was to seek out 
money for undergraduate scholar-
ships, Being the secretary, my some-
what less glorious task was to push 
papers around, and in the process, I 
watched the names of the entities 
that sponsored undergraduate schol-
arships run by as stapled, collated 
and filed: defense companies, local 
business tycoons, biotech compa-
nies, anonymous donors - every-
one, it seemed, but people who had 
attended UCSD (with the nouble 
exception of alumnus Michael 
Robertson, who has managed to 
corne up with a way to charge for 
open-source software). Now, maybe 
the money from alumni donors was 
ending up elsewhere, but a quick 
check of the U.S, News & World 
Report sutistics shows that while 
UCSD is solidly in the top 50 of the 
magazines (albeit flawed) rankings, 
our alumni giving ranlc is an arra-
cious 191 - 8 percent of graduates. 

The trite thing to wri te a t this 
juncture would be: "Now, our do~­
tion nte is only low because we're a 
40-year-old university without a 
football team. Thats why it's up to 
you to help fund undergnduate 
scholarships, nonscience research, 

and residential facilities - otherwise 
our university will fail, well have no 
minority students, and John Muir 
and Revelle Colleges will collapse 
into the Pacific." 

1lUs writer has no doubt that 
many of the alumni will be swayed 
with phone calls over the corning 
years with that theme (well, proba-
bly not with that level of hyperbole). 
UCSD Development probably has a 
tracking database that rivals the 
intelligence agmcies of many small 
COWltries, and this writer can guar-
antee impending ~duates that they 

" UCSD Development probably has a tracking 
database that rivals ... 
many small countries, " 

will be hunted down. For those of us 
who think that a somewhat arbitraty 
chauvinistic attachment to any insti-
tution (such as a nation, religion or 
school) is somewhat silly, or those of 
us who are just far too bored at 
UCSD to have "school spirit," what 
is a compelling argument for donat-
ing to UCSD after graduation? 
After all, what did this public school 
do for us? It served its purpose -
the taxpayers of California, inchxl-
ing our parents, funded our educa-
tion, we were educated, and for 
many of us, not particularly thrilled 
during the process (although that 
will change during Sun God). It 
makes as much sense, it seems, as 
donating to the DMV after passing 
the driving tesL 

From a purely self-interested 
viewpoint at least, donating to your 
school potentially enhances the 
quality of your degree, if the institu-
tion gets any better as a result The 
problem is a classic prisoners dilem-
ma - your dollars (unless you get 
fabulously rich) are diluted by 
20,000 undergnduates, and every-
one who has a diploma benefits. The 
sman thing to do would be to con-
vince your friends to donate with 
you, and then donate nothing your-
self at the last minute. It seems, in 
any case, some degree of altruism is 
required for a ntional decision to 
donate. 

So why donate to UCSD? What 
about an orphanage in TIjuana? Or 
toward distribution of AIDS drugs 
in foreign countries? 'Ibis writer 
asserts that for those of us lucky 
enough to have money to donate in 
the future, UCSD is a more valid 
cause because the alumni collective-
ly understand it better than any 
other group, and each alumnus like-
ly knows UCSD bener than many 
other institutions or programs to 
which he or she could potentially 
donate. In other words, if one is 
going to give money to anyone, 
UCSD is a viable candidate. For 
those people who contend UCSD 
has been taken over by the corporate 
interests of science and engineering 
majors, sponsor a scholarship to 
attract an outstanding hwnanities 
major. Help an underfunded liberal 
media organization print its papers 
in the face of the deluge of CIlIiforniIl

lied against "hate speech." If you

Editor: 
Recently, I was visiting some 

ftiends in Eleanor Roosevelt 
College, and as I was walking 
back to the parking lot, I saw a 
friend of mine who looked lilre 
she was feeling ill. I stopped to 
make sure she was fine. She was. 
I offered her my services, and she 
politely declined because they 
weren't needed. A police officer 
soon showed up along with two 
resident security officers. One 
RSO was questioning the young 
lady and convinced her she need-
ed to be watched for the next four 
hours. I cha tted wi th . the police 
officer on the girl's behalf and 
told him she was merely walking 
from her car in the Pangea struc-
ture with her designated driver to 
her house, and that I stopped to 
be a Good Samaritan. All our 
actions were in the best pre-
scribed manner they could possi -
bly be in. A few moments later he 
accused me of being "drunk," He 
referred me to the RSO after 
they had arrested this girl for 
public intoxication. 

The RSO asked me all sorts of 
questions that I felt I had to 
answer or otherwise I would have 
been in direct defiance of a uni-
versity official. I did not want to 
answer them and said as much, 
due to certain clauses in the U.S. 
Constitution. The RSO and her 
male associate followed me to my 

I would like to express my dis-
gust with the overall situation. 
First, the girl clearly did not need 
to be escorted downtown for pub-
lic intoxication. 'Ibis was a waste 
of everyones time. At a school 
comparable to UCSD, such as 
Stanford, this situation would have 
never occurred due to a more 
lenient alcohol policy and respect 
for the students. UCSD srudents 
don't need to be policed like chil-
dren. Secondly, I think that the 
police officer didn't believe me 
because of my lack of shoes. The 
infonnation I provided was accu-
rate and helpful. I have only worn 
shoes on occasion since my senior 
year of high school as it is symbol-
ic of my personal beliefs. Never at 
any time was I a threat to mysel f or 
any other person, and most impor-

tant�y never did I act in a disorder-
ly manner. Lastly, I am 22 years 
old and very insulted and appalled 
that at an influential university 
such as UCSD that affirms the 
right of freedom of expression and 
open expression of individuali ty, I 
was not created in a courteous, 
sensitive, confidential and respect-
ful manner. What 1 learned from 
this experience is the very people 
installed to uphold the principles 
of community are its biggest 
detractors.

facilities, pitch in when they ask to 
build a new building. 

Having gone through life at a 
public university, the soon-to-be-
graduates are the best-placed to 
understand where the failings are, 
no doubt because undergraduates 
constantly feel they end up on the 
lesser side of a balance between 
research and education. Then 
again, those of us who only have 
$50, rather than $50,000, to con-
tribute may find making a meaning-
ful contribution to a specific cause 
somewhat difficult. Also, the 
Development office no doubt 
encourages and appreciates "unre-
stricted" money in large sums. 
There's even a special parking per-
mit for those who donate $1,500 in 
unrestricted funds every year so 
they can come visit UCSD, and not 
have to recall the nightmare of yel-

low-spaced parking or the Regents 
shuttle. 

In the end, the most compelling 
reason is an emotion that cannot be 
distilled to either rationality or blind 
chauvinism, especially if one con-
tributes to an unrestricted fund. A 
cynic might cite arrogant etitism or 
San Diego weather, but graduate 
students and professors often take a 
professional risk and a pay cut to 
work at a public university rather 
than working in industry or a private 
university. While there are students 
who go through this school mutter-
ing about the dearth of activities and 
intelligence among its populace, 
there are quite a few who actively try 
to make our lives more interesting 
- through student government, 
athletics teams, barbecues on 
Library Wallc, or God forbid, writ-
ing in a school newspaper. There are 
students who bury their heads in 

their books, help out in school labs, 
or think critically about what tht')' 
are studying for more than just the 
potential of material success, and 
contribute to the higher thought 
processes of others through alterna-
tively humorous and intelligent con-
versatioo. In short, this writer feels a 
debt of gratitude to the people of 
this university. He would, in any 
case, urge those who think they owe 
the universi ty nothing after it has set 
them on their course for tife to 
reconsider their poor manners, 
despite whatever failings the school 
might have.

principles. As a result. all correspon-

school dropouts. Kerry is right to 
focus voters' anention on the high 
school dropout rate, which is unac-
ceptably high - in some c1istricts, as 
high as 50 percent, accorcling to 
Kerry's numbers. But not only will 
this do nothing to prevent students 
from dropping out (3 well as fill the 
roads with unlicensed, uninsured 
drivers); it's also downright silly. 
Whats next? Is Kerry going to take 
away their lV-watching privileges 
and say, "No dessen for a week'" 
This is exactly the kind of paternal-
istic, big-government mentality 

that~ going to hurt Kerry in the 
general election. 

In a Clinton-esque appeal to the 
center, however, Kerry has not shied 
away from offending teachers' 
unions like the National Education 

Association. While they applaud the 
federal bonuses he~ proposed for 
teachers who serve in needy schools, 
they cautiously object to his call for 
performance-based pay and more 
fl exible processes for removing 
unsuccesstul teachers. 

The fact is, American public 
education is only as good as its 
teachers. Until every classroom is 
staffed with a teacher who genuine-
ly cares about his or her students' 
achievements and has the training 
and the resources to provide them 
the best ed uca tion possible, we 
won't malce any gains. We've got to 
a mact and retain sharper teachers. 
This cou ld Start with the kind of pay 
increases Kerry's proposing. It will 
also take a massive public relations 
campaign, aimed at changing the 
public vision of teaching and teach-

ers; teaching must be seen as an 
exciting, innovative field in which 
brilliant people can be recognized 
for their success, not a stagnant job 
for those who can't do anything else. 

It's wonderful that education has 
not been drowned out amid the sex-
ier issues of economic recovery and 
conflict abroad. Those concerned 
about maintaining America's posi-
tion at the va nguard of the world's 
economy and giving all students the 
chance to succeed regardles of 
income level or skin color should 
demand that it remain in the elec-
toral spotlight. If this is going to 
happen, it requires the rigor and 
accountability that con ervatives 
demand, and the extra funding the 
liberals want. Let's hope this centrist 
approach will emerge from thi 
year's ugly presidential race.

Letters: Feminist groups use biased statistics 
continued (rom page 5 
AccusatiOI) of 

chauvinism unfounded 
Editor: 

I am responding to Feminist 
Majority Leadership Alliance 
President Mary McQueen~ letter 
regarding domestic violence, in 
which she falsely accuses me of being 
a "chauvinist." This, however, is 
untrue - simply read my letter to 
the editor ("UCSD feminist groups 
promote hannfuI myths," April 19) 
and you'll find no evidence that I am 
a chauvinist. 

I should also clarify my previous 
letter: My argwnent is solely con-
cerned with domestic violence. I 
have never made any claims about 
the male/female victim ratio regard-
ing rape. McQueen uses a false sta-
tistic: She claims, "In fact, according 
to the U.S. Department ofjustice ... 
85 percent of domestic violence vic-
tims are women." Of course, this 
(outdated) number is obtained from 
police reports, which are obviously 
biased; if a male victim calls the 
police, he will lilcely be laughed at, 
not taken seriously, or accused of 
being the abuser and arrested. 

It~ no wonder that, according to 
the police, most victims are women. 

Let's look at another quote from 
McQueen's letter: "using (anI out-
dated statistics source from the 
1980s that was based on faulty rea-
soning, Bronstein writes, 'it has been. 
shown that women attaclc their part-
ners at roughly the same rate as 
men.It• 

I assume that she is referring to 
the Strauss-Gelles survey I men-
tioned in my letter, one of many 
studies that support my point. The 
survey has hardly been discredited; 
feminist groups simply claimed that 
the abusive women in the survey 
must have been defending them-
selves (using the common myth that 
any woman who attacks a man must 

be acting in self-defense). Their 
claim, however, is false. 

But regardless of your opinion on 
the survey, there are plenty of other 
studies that suppan my case. For 
instance, a study by Brinkerhoff and 
Lupri found that "severe" violence 
by wives against husbands was sig-
nificantly more common than the 
reverse. If you're interested in look-
ing into this subject, check out the 
following Web site: bttp:llw71!w.mm-
wtb.orgl fttbm.btm. It lists over 100 
studies - in reputable journals -
that support my casco 

In any case, we must not allow 
the feminist groups (such as the 
National Organization for Women 
and UCSD's very own Feminist 
Majority Leadership Alliance) to 
define domestic violence solely as a 
male on female phenomenon. Men, 
do you want to go to jail, accused of 
being an abuser, after being attacked 
by your partner? Women, do you 
think that violent females should be 
exempt from jail time? Feminist 
groups have a dangerous goal and it 
is imperative that they not be 
allowed to succeed.

Greek system ,Provides 
opportunities 

Editor: 
I'm glad that the GumrJiIm chose 

to run a PRO/CON on the Greek 
system ("The Greek system, April 
19) because it allows students to 
learn more about· our population of 
almost 2,000 undergraduate stu-
dents. We are members and promi-
nent leaders of almost all of the 400-
plus student organizations on cam-
pus, including the A.S. Council, 
Womens Commission, college stu-
dent councils, the Student 
Organization Funding Advisory 
Board, Student Affirmative Action 

IIEII GUIS TIE 

Comminee and many more. We are 
a facet to student tife, among the 
many other great organizations out 
there. 

There were some things that I 
did want to expand upon that were 
fallacies: 

About segregation: There is no 
one in the Greek system that would 
look at someone and think, "Oh, you 
aren't so-and-so, you can't look at 
me." How ridiculous is that? You 
don't just make friends wi th your sis-
ters or brothers, you make friends 
with all of their friends, too. I have 
learned so much about all the differ-
ent activities on campus through my 
sisters. Networking is everything in 
this world, as all graduating seniors 
know. You want a job? Look no fur-
ther than the Greek system: 
Someone always knows someone 
who can help you find a job, sell a 
car, or just buy a taco. 

About paying dues: We don't buy 
our friends. That money goes to 
philanthropies, operating costs and 
all the perks that we get. Our dues 
are like a deposit on something huge 
that we get bade. Paying $500 to 
$1,000 per year for dues is not bad 
when you can get $1,000 to $10,000 
in scholarships and grants exclusive 
to Greeks. 

About "active Greek members 
routinely avoid(ingl members of all 
ethnic and cultural groups": As 
members in probably all cultural 
organizations on and off campus, as 
well as doing charity work for orga-
niza tions allover the world, I can't 
see how this has any substance. If 
you think we avoid you, why don't 
you just come up and say "hi" to us 
first? 

Just come see what we are about 
and ask questions to people that you 
see proudly wearing their letters 
around campus.

process and memories Cho has left 
with the community. 

"I did things to push the grief 
aside; I worked, and my grief went 
into remission ... but as soon as the 
dust and conunotion settled, the 
grief rerurned," Quan said. "Grief is 
not a state - it's a process. While at 
times it appears we can't break the 
cycle of grief, the pattern will break, 
it will end ... it will come to a con-
clusion." 

Quan shared a conversation he 
had with his five-year-old son abom 
C hos passing, and how that conver-
sation brought him closer [Q finding 
closure. 

" I told him that one of my stu-
dents had passed away, and, as prob-
ably only a five -year-old could tell 
you, he smiled and said, 'That's 
good, Daddy, because now hes in 
heaven,'" Quan said. "At first my 
reaction was one of shock and disbe-
lief. How could a five-year-old be so 
cruel to think the termination of a 
life was a joyful occasion? But as I 
thought about what he aid, the 
shock passed and gave way to 
peace." 

Sixth College Provost Gabriele 
Wienhausen also spoke at the vigil. 

"Daniel has had a profound 
impact on all of us," she said. "He 
reminded us we are a community 
within a larger community," 
Wienhausen said. "He made us 
cherish and celebrate love and 
friendship. We know Dan will forev-
er be in our heam." 

Wienhausen also read an excerpt 
from 3 letter given to her by one of 
Chos teaching assista nts. The letter 
read: "When [Daniel] spoke, his 
words were deliberate, lucid and 
clear. He stood out as someone who 
was very respectful of his classmates 
... and n.'cognired the importance of 
someone else's interpretation."

sized the bene~olent role Cho 
played in both Websters life and the 
lives of other members of the UCSD 
community. 

"He opened the door in my life 
with a laugh and a smile," Webster 
said. "Dan was happy - happy to 
explore, happy to meet new friends. 
If I had never met him, I would 
never have met God. It still doesn't 
make sense. I don't know if it'll ever 
make sense why it happened." 

Director of Psychological and 
Counseling ~rvices Reyna Juarez 
spoke at the conclusion of the event.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN TliURSDAY, MAY 13, 2004 

Compad: Undergrad fees to rise annually 
coruinued from page I 

vice president of external affairs of 
the Graduate Student Association, 
the compact will raise graduate 
tuition by 45 percent over the next 
three years relative to fees this year, 
and undergraduate ruition will 
similarly increase by JJ percent 
over the next three years. 

"I think that fee increases 
should be one of the last things 
enacted in order to balance the 
budget," Sixth College freshman 
Kevin Wood said. "Education is 
one of the most important services 
the government provides, and I'd 
much rather see taX increases or 
lower prison funding than see stu-
dents who are unable to get an 
education because of the cost." 

Under the compact, the 
University of California agreed to 
use non-state resources to provide 
512 million to support K-12 acade-
mic outreach programs, with addi-
tional state funding to be deter-
mined later by the state budget. 

Academic Success Program 
Director Terry Le said he was dis-
appointed by. the lack of state 
funding for outreach programs. 

"Though non-state resources 
provide 512 million in outreach, 
that still does not justify the gover-

nor~ action in eliminating outreach 
completely and ignoring the state~ 

commitment to education for not 
just those in college but those in 
years to come," Le said. "That is a 
pretty clear message the governor 
is sending regarding access to high-
er education when outreach is cut." 

The compact specifies that the 

" No students and not even 
close to MIf of the uc 
chancellors took part in 

~l_ ., " 
me negonatwns ...

Student Assoc:iIIian 
University of California will 
reserve between 20 and J J per-
cent of new fee revenues for 
financial aid. The state will pro-
vide the university with an annual 
funding growth of J percent for 
faculty and staff salaries and other 
university cost increases. 

Although the agreement pro-
vides funding for an additional 
5,000 students each year, begin-
ning in 2005-06, the plan does not 
address the II,JOO UC-eligible 

freshmen that were turned away 
for fall 2004. 

"I think to deny access to 10,000 
kids just for some promise that 
things might be better in the future 
is disappointing," State Sen. Dede 
Alpert (D-San Diego) said. 

Many student leaders are also 
upset that the negotiations 
between the University of 
California and the governor were 
the result of a closed-door deal. 

"No students and not even 
close to half of the UC chancel-
lors took part in the negotiations 
with the governor," Flowe said. 

Schwarzenegger will need to 
have the compact agreement 
passed by the Legislature annual-
ly. According to Alpert, many 
Democratic representatives are 
unhappy with the agreement. 

"Certainly the Legislature 
wasn't a party in this agreement," 
Alpert said. "I'm imagining that 
the Democrats will be proposing 
some very different alternatives." 

UCSA has officially rejected 
the compact, and UCSD's GSA 
has unanimously decided to fol-
low UCSNs position. 

"Now is the time for students to 
organize and lobby the legislature 
for the accessibility and quality of 
the University of California," GSA 
President Eric Frecherte said. 

Co-op: Parties nearing agreement on lease 
continued from page J 

GSA, University Centers Advisory 
Board and the Food Co-op, are at 
the final stages of reviewing the 
MSA. Director of University 
Centers Gary Ratcliff said that 
UCAB is working on ensuring 
that the agreement goes through. 
Ratcliff said that about 3,500 sur-
vey results showed that students 
would like more low-cost healthy 
food options at Price Center. 

uThe resul ts of a survey of stu-
dents guided the decision," 

Ratcliff said. "Rather than wait for 
the expansion, we decided to ask 
the Food Co-op if they would be 
interested in opening a location in 
the Price Center. The students on 
UCAB were behind the decision 
all the way." 

According to Ratcliff, there are 
some objective performance crite-
ria in the agreement for the satel-
lite location that allow UCAB to 
determine whether or not to renew 
the lease at the end of two years. 

"One of the criteria, for exam-

pic, states that the Food Co-op 
annual sales in the Price Center 
must meet a minimum threshold," 
Ratcliff said. "This minimum sales 
threshold will serve as an indicator 
that the Food Co-op is an operat-
ing Price Center location in a man-
ner that is meeting students' 
needs." 

The Master Space Agreement 
for the satellite location at Price 
Center is similar to the lease for the 
Food Co-op, Groundwork Books 
and the General Store Co-op. 

Gender: Electrical/computer engineering has lowest proportion of women 
continued from page I 

ing, computer science/engineering 
and electrical/computer engineering. 
In bioengineering, undergraduate 
females constitute 36.5 percent of the 
total number of students, and female 
graduate students fonn 37.5 percent 
of the total. Less than JO percent of 
undergraduate structural engineer-
ing majors are female, while 22 per-
cent of strucruraJ engineering gradu-
ate students are female. 

Of the MAE majors, 15.4 per-
cent of the undergraduate students 
are female, while 17.6 percent of 
the graduate students are female . In 
CSE, almost 85 percent of under-
gradua tes are male and about 79 
percent of graduates are male. 

In ECE, only 148 out of 1,063 
undergraduates are femal e. 

"We are concerned [with these 
statistics]. but the application is not 
something we can control," said 
ECE Chair Paul Yu, whose depart-
ment enrolls the lowest percentage 
of women on campus. "We need to 
go back to the source of the prob-
lem ... the [female applicant) pool is 
much smaller. Across the country 
there are not many people in the 
pool." 

More than 86 percent of under-
graduates in ECE are male, and 
male graduate students represent 
84 percent of the total snldents. 

According to Yu, very few 
women apply for the science and 
engineering majors and, conse-
quently, few ever become engineer-
ing majors and professors. 

"We are trying to enlarge the 
pool of graduate students so that 
there will be more people to 
become professionals," Yu said. 

Maria Charles, an associate 
professor of sociology and expert 

on gender segregation in higher 
education, co-authored a federally 
funded study on the underrepre-
sentation of women in science and 
engineering. She said she has 
found that women continue to shy 
away from "traditionally male" 
fields of study in favor of other 
subjects. 

"I think it's rooted in beliefs 
about discrimination, in beliefs 
about competence, and, to a certain 
extent, internalized preferences," 
Charles said. "It's this 'equal-but-
different' ideology - even in the 
feminist movements you find ele-
ments of this - that I think drives 
tltis horizontal segregation 
[between fields) ." 

While males dominate most of 
the science and engineering 
departments, women continue to 
make up sizable majorities in social 
science and humanities fields. The 
gap is starkest in human develop-
ment, where women make up more 
than 93 percent of the program's 
454 declared students. 

Vlhile the :lumber of male stu-
dents in science and engineering 
majors is significantly higher than 
that of females, some female stu-
dents said they did not feel this 
affected their experience in these 
majors. 

"I notice when there's not a lot 
of girls in my classes, but that's 
about it," said Thurgood Marshall 
College sophomore Megan Reid, a 
structural engineering major. "I 
don't feel like the professors talk to 
me any differently . . . I don't think 
people treat me any differently." 

Thurgood Marshall College 
junior and communication major 
Cassie Vinnedge said she believes 
that the imbalance is promoted by 

traditional notions of what and who 
women are supposed to be. 

"It seems to align with old 
stereotypes," Vinnedge said. 

Most of the departments in 
which males have a large majority 
over women are UCSD~ impacted 
majors - those majors most diffi-
cult to be admitted to. The impact-
ed majors include bioengineering, 

" One theory is that WJmen 
are less likely to be 

encouraged in technical ar 
mathematical fields, 

starting even in 
elementary school ... " 

~~~ 
computer science, computer engi-
neering and electrical engineering, 
all majors where women are under-
represented in enrollment. All of 
these majors must be declared upon 
application to UCSD, and cannot 
be switched into once one becomes 
a student. 

However, the departments do 
not keep records of the gender dis-
tribution of applicants to these 
majors. 

Although UCSD applicant 
Melody Jue, a senior at Castro 
Valley High School, said she was 
interested in science and engineer-
ing, she said she has decided to 

attend UC Davis as an English 
major. 

"I didn't want to pin myself 
down in a pursuit that was very lim-
ited," J ue said. "I still lib: math and 
science ... Being a girl, I know there 
are a lot of males [in the science and 
engineering fields]. That's not 
something that factors into my 
opinion." 

While women continue to 
make up roughly the same propor-
tion of the total UCSD population 
as in fall 2000, data from individ-
ual departments suggest that the 
inequality in gender representa-
tion is increasing. In MAE, ECE, 
CSE, physics, philosophy and 
chemical engineering, the propor-
tion of women has dropped since 
2000. 

From fall 2000 to spring 2004, 
the physics department has seen a 
drop from 34.6 percent of females 
to 20.1 percent of females in under-
graduate physics majors, according 
to statistics from the registrar's 
office. In MAE, ECE and CSE, the 
proportion of undergraduate 
female majors has decreased by 
approximately 2 percent from 2000 
to 2004, while female chemical 
engineering majors have dropped 
by 4 percent. 

According to assistant profes-
sor of sociology Mary Blair-Loy, 
the disparity of males versus 
females in several departments is a 
phenomenon that begins prior to 
college. 

"One theory is that women are 
less likely to De encouraKCd in tech-
nical or mathematical tields, start-
ing even in elementary school, alld 
that there is a systematic and 
unconscious discouragement of 
women and encouragement of 

men," Blair-Loy said. 
However, she said that women 

who do enter technical fields per-
form as weD as their male counter-
parts. 

"The women that are in these 
fields, although there aren't enough 
of them and that is a big problem, 
are just as productive as the men 
are, and sometimes are even more 
productive," Blair-Loy said. 

Carolyn Gordon, president of 
the Association of Women in 
Mathematics and a math professor 
at Dartmouth College, expressed 
her frustration with the nationwide 
statistics. 

"We are quite concerned," 
Gordon said. "The numbers [of 
females in the affected fields) are 
improving, but not as quickly as we 
like. It's stiU much too low of a per-
centage." 

Outreach groups such as the 
AWM are trying to improve the 
lopsided numbers by providing 
mentoring programs for high 
school, undergraduate and gradu-
ate students, encouraging AWM 
university student chapters and 
providing workshops for women in 
the later stages of graduate school, 
Gordon said. 

Department of Communication 
Chair Geoffrey Bowker, whose 
department is favored by undergrad-
uate women wee to one, believes 
that steps must be taken to address 
gender inequity. 

"I think an enormous amount 
should be done," Bowker 
said. "There needs to be positive 
programs to bring women in at the 
Wldergraduate level, graduate level, 
staff and leadership positions. We've 
still got a long way to go before gen-
der equity [is achieved]."

For John Muir College sopho-

"I look forward to the fact that 
UCSD lcids will actually try to have 
fun for once in their life," Zehnder 
said. 

The festival is free lO all UCSD 
students with a valid campus ID. 
Guest ticlcets are on sale at Price

Former A.S. Commissioner of 
Service and Enterprises Colin 
Parent took interest in the project 
and, along with Mahaffey and 
Grube, started a partnership 
between Associated Students and 
UCSD Recreation that helped 
renew interest in the course. In 
December 2003, Associated 
Students reallocated $60,000 to the 
construction of the project. The 
project finished construction in 
January. 

"It~ really ooting for the two 
departments, Associated Students 
and Campus Recreation, to do a 
joint venrure like this," Grube said. 
"I feel it sends a really important 
message to the entire campus com-
munity that staff and students and 
faculty want to work together tD

place for students." 

The ChaUeqe Counc founders 
said this CYeIlt marks one of the few 

nets, rope ladders,

devices to allow individuals or teams 
to get to the top. The lower course

Cogan said that Associated 
Students' portion of the profit 
made from this enterprise will be 
reinvested in the A.S. budget for 
items like Triton Taxi and student 
organizations, among others. 

So far, Residential Life staffs, 
sororities, fraternities and various 
student organizations have 
expressed interest in using the 
Challenge Course, according to 
Cogan. To date, over 20 organiza-

course. Prices for using the course 
vary depending on the number of

THURSDAY, MAY 13, 2004 

For both good reasons and bad, with both positive intentions and potentially offen-sive ones, the film "Troy" is not Homer's 
"The Iliad." The creators of "Troy," as 
expected, have taken liberties with the great 

story and gone so far as to completely 
remove some key elements of 
Homer's epic tale, most impor-
tant of which is the fact that the 
gods are nowhere to be seen. 
Homer's Story begins with a feud 

among the greator goddesses 
that sparks the kidnapping of 
Helen of Sparta (later Helen of 

Troy) and the ensuing war. In the 
Warner Bros. version, the gods playa 

purely mythic role as they are 
mentioned only by those who 

are portrayed as not in tune 
with the real world . All 

major conflicts and dis-
ruptions are caused by 
human beings without 
the safety net of divine 
intervention - a bold 
choice for the filmmak-
ers, and a good one. 

This film aims to be 
an epic story about peo-
ple, characters with 
flaws and desires and 
dreams, 3nd how they 
are destroyed by the 
greed of presidents, er, 

kings and their will 
to dominate the 

earth.

And despite the film's many successes, they 
just had to add one of those made-for-
Hollywood love stories that of course does 
what it always does: distract not only from 
the plot but from the heroes that we all paid 
to see. Overall, the battle scenes are dynam-
ic, effective and violent without being terri-
bly bloody. Audiences see the war ebb and 
flow, and the computer generated folk really 
stick to the background, which is refreshing. 
It's nice to see a large portion of real dudes 
with real spears on real sand on a real beach, 
and it just made the entire film that much 
more powerful.

"Troy" is the story of the great Greek 
warrior Achilles (Brad Pitt) and how he 
learns to find love and humanity in a world 
to which he once swore off any allegiance . 
Pitt holds his own in the role, though he just 
reeks with contemporary voice and attitude. 

Achilles is half-immortal (his moth-
er is a sea nymph), and at times it 

appears that his father must have 
been 1yler Durden from "Fight 
'~ClUb." Overall, the character 

of Achilles was brilliantly 
crafted - when he fights, he

moves faster and more fluidly than anyone 
else on the battlefield, as if his weapons 
weigh only ounces. Though it is never 
explicitly explained, we get the picture that 
Achilles just isn't on the same plane as any of 
the other soldiers ... and yes, Achilles does 
find love in the visage of a Trojan priestess 
(Rose Byrne) - a virgin of Apollo (and also 
the cousin of his mortal enemy). The priest-
ess teaches him of love and life and a 
fondness for sorbet , blah blah 
blah. But he should have 
let his men kill her 
and figured out life 
on his own . 

Achilles' 
main opposi-
tion lies in the 
body of Hector 
(Eric Bana), the 
greatest Trojan war-
rior and heir to the 
throne of Troy. We see 
great contrasts in the 
two combatants : Hector 
is a great swordsman, 
natural leader and 
patriot, and also a 
father, son and brother. He 
is presented in a stoic and 
matter-of-fact nature that rings 
true given his great pressures and 
his humanity. Achilles is a prima 
donna recluse who holds alle-
giance [0 no one but his own 
small band of men, which 
he leads with great zeal. 
And he is , of course, 
the greatest warrior 
that ever lived.

What 's so exciting about Van Ltar Rou, the best-reviewed album 
thus far of 2004? For 

starters, it's fun . Loretta 
Lynn is a country legend, 
but collaborator Jack White 
doesn't treat her like one. 
Instead, he puts her strong 
voice and emotive lyrics at 
the forefront of songs that 
range from rough-and-tum-
ble rockers to dreamy 
soundscapes to stark ballads. 
Somehow, it all works. 

Georgia native Shannon Wright rerurns to the indie-rock scene with 
her new album, Over 

the Sun; this time her music 
is a little darker, a little 
more intense and a little 
more robust. Her debut 
album, FJightsa!ety, saw a 
warmer, candy-coated 
Shannon, but that Shannon 
has gone. Her poetic, emo-
tionally charged, fervent 
lyrics are still present, but 
behind it all are forceful 
and aggressive vocals

12 HIATUS 

An engrossing film of 
'Super-sized' proportions 

Documentarian chronicles his life on a 
McDonald's diet with alarming results 

By W MAl 
Staff Writer 

A Big Mac with extra mayo and double cheese, a strawberry sundae, an icy soda, and a 
heaping carton of fr ies - super 
sized. Yummy right? Not after 
watching Morgan Spurlock's 
"Super Size Me." the Michael 
Moore-esque documentary on fast 
food and obesity in America. This 
film del ivers a hilariously smart yet 
disgustingly straightforward look 
into this "fast food nation" that 
takes pride in everything that 
cCl>mes in gargantuan proportions 
- especia lly food. 

The documentary fo llows 
writer/director/producer Spurlock

regime of Mc Donald's food cou-

Spurlock proves that fast food 
is. with no simpler terms avail-
able. very bad for you . More 
importantly, however, "Super 
Size Me" is able to point out a 
truth that not even the greatest of 
science books could teach 
America: This alarmingly great 
rise in binge-eating fast food is an 
addiction unde tected by the lay-
man 's' eye. 

Without much required for 
great fi lmic effects and action', the 
documentary shows a side of real ity 
that no reality show could capture. 
And it is very satisfying. With the

DVC's Masquerade to entrance party-goers 
Pre-Sun God dance event features UCSD OJs, underground music 

By IAN S. PORI' 
Staff Writer 

The DJs and Vinylphiles club of UCSD wiU present "Pre-Pany: An Electronic Masquerade" 
May 19 at Porters Pub. Designed 
as a pre-Sun God party, the event 
will feature two different areas of 
trance, house, drwn 'n' bass, breaks 
and more, plus free beads and 
masks in the tradition of an old-
fashioned masquerade. 

The "Electronic Masquerade" 
is the latesr in a series of eventS that 
are the group\; main focus, along 
with providing music for UCSD 
parties and training aspiring DJs. 

The group was founded in 

1997 by two graduate students 
interested in mixing music and 
performing at parties. Mter 
adding two more graduate student 
members, however. the group 
became frustrated by the lack of 
available funds and the discrepan-
cies between what they wanted to 
play and what they discovered 
people wanted to hear. Early club 
members were dissatisfied playing 
Top 40 hits and wanted to ellplore 
the underground scene more. 

So the group changed direc-
tion. Leadership was handed over 
to undergraduate members, who 
were bener able to carry out the 
growing bureaucratic duties of the 
club and, most importantly, were

eligible to receive A.S . funds. The 
DJs and Vinylphiles Club as we 
know it today was born. 

With new leadership and a 
new name, the club also took on a 
new focus: providing quality elec-
tronic music for UCSD events 
and parties. The group usually 
puts on a couple of events a quar-
ter, and perfonns at many more. 
Muirstock and WinterFest, most 
notably, are on the list of the 
group's recent performances. 

The club also focuses on train-
ing up-and-comers in the skills of 
electronic music production . 
Training seminars are available 
almost daily; students can go to 
the DVC office (located on the 
second floor of Student Center) 
at any of the times offered to learn 
the ropes of spinning from the 
club's senior members, often on 
high-quality equipment. 

Information on training semi-
nars, new and old events, and book-
ing DJs is available on the group's 
Web site at http://djclub.lIcsd.edu . 
Also on the Web site is a fairly 
ClIhaustive catalog of recordings of 
club members' previous perfor-
mances, available for download, 
plus links to other DJ groups and 
local DJ-related stores. 

"Pre-Party: An Electronic 
Masquerade" will take place at 
7p.m. in the Stage room at Porter's 
Pub. Admission is free, but the 
party is only for those aged 18 and 
up. 

'La Puta Vida' is a tragicomic Uruguayan treat 
San Diego Latino Film Festival serves up a dramatic treat 

By BIIAN UIGA 
Staff Writer 

This little gem of a film is the toast of its native Uruguay, and irs not difficulr to see why. All 
at once, it's a quirky "working girl" 
comedy, a Strong morality play 
against corruption and the sell 
trade in Barcelona, and a gut-
wrenching, tragic drama. There\; 
literally something for everybody 
in "En La Puta Vida," - provided, 
of course, that "everybody" is over 
18. You didn't think that a film 
whose untranslated title means "In 
the Life of a Whore" would be 
without a healthy dose of sex, did 
you? Actually, there is a surprising-
ly small amount of sex in "En La 
Puta Vida," though it is used as a 
device for the film's best laughs in 
its opening scenes before such 
small diversions are brushed aside 
and the drama unfolds. 

And it is in this drama where 
"En La Puta Vida" really succeeds. 
Based on a true sex scandal that 
rocked Uruguay in 1992, the film 
follows the sometimes humorous 
and often soap-opera tragic adven-
tures of Elisa, a single mother 
whose dreams of a beauty parlor 
and food for her children cause her 
to enter the seedy world of prosti-
tution. Of course, things being 
what they are, she is soon trapped 
with abusive pimp/ex-lover Placido 

in Ba"rcelona as a sex slave with no 
hope of returning on forged 
papers. 

Newcomer Mariana Santangelo 
brings a manic intensity to the role 
of Elisa, single-handedly carrying 
the film. Santangelo's Elisa is 
somewhere halfway between 

" There's literally something 
for everybody in 'En La 
PUla Vida,' - proWled 
of course, that 'every .. 

body' is over 18." 

"Amelie" and "Tank Girl," an 
incredibly spunky character whose 
unusually bright outlook and 
upbeat sensibilities make for a nice 
contrast to the dreary surroundings 
and situations she finds herself in 
throughout the film. Also, soap 
opera star Silvestre's depiction of 
cold, down-to-earth Placido pro-
vides a nice foil for Santangelo's 
sensi bili ties. A colorful cast of 
extras (including the mandatory 
crowd of prostitutes and a gang of 
rough Brazilian transvestites) keeps 
the story interesting.

14 HIATUS THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Confessions of a disaster flick junkie 
Who else loves unrealistic apocalyptic drivel? 

short kids 
arecool~ 

Deena AI Shatti 

I t's Sunday night. and I'm gear-ing up for the awesome N BC mini-series " 10.5." The alco-
hol is chill ing in the fridge, and it's 
only a maner of time before the 
Space Needle tumbl es to the 
ground and the Golden Gate 
Bridge collapses, again . 

Ladies and gentlemen, I am a 
disaster movie whore. 

I love disaster movies. No mat-
ler 'how cheesy or campy these 
movies are, they're always fantas-
tic. Some people like B-level hor-
ror movies, 1 like disaster movies. 
O nce I saw the previews for 
" 10.5," I was giddy with excite-
ment. Major metropoli tan cities 
collapsing? Amtrak trains being 
swallowed up by the earth ? 

uc.lear weapons being used to 
Stop earthquakes? Oh man, it 's 
like Christmas. Even bener, the 
producers of this particular film 
didn't bother to consult , you 
know, actual scientists, bur instead 
decided tha t researchi ng on tile 
Internet was the right way to go 
about il. ever mind that a mag-
nitude 10.5 earthquake isn't actu-
ally possible, and never mind mat 
the an Andreas Fault really and 
truly cannot split open. T he 
Internet holds the truth to all 
things' 

I'm glad they resorted to 
these "research methods." T he 
more campy, cheesy, standard-
disaster-movie even[S, the bener. 
It could almost be a dnnking 
game: Drink every time a news-
caster is rendered speechless by 
the magnitude of the trauma. 
Drink when someone makes a 
heroic sacri fice, dyi ng to save the 
greater populace. Drink whenev-
er a national mo nu ment is 
destroyed. Dri nk every time an 
improbable event takes place, 
like the San Andreas Fault split-
ting opm. Finish off all the alco-
hol when California fina lly fa lls 
into the ocean, thus giving Las 
Vegas that oceanfro nt view it has 
always wa nted. 

I'm proba bl y the on ly person 
in the world excited for "Day 
After Tomorrow," the summer 
fi lm that feat ures hurricanes, 
tornadoes, ea rthquakes, t idal 
waves, floods and the next Ice 

Age rapidly hitting the earth 
with Dennis Quaid as the heroic 
scientist trying to save the world 
- excuse me, America - from 
total disaster. 

That's the common trend in 
disaster movies. Though the 
entire world will be destroyed by 
that asteroid hitting the earth (see 
"Armageddon," "Deep Impact"), 
America is the only country that 
matters, and it is Americans who 
save the world . It seems that 
H ollywoo d, and the American 
public, have some kind of hero 
complex . To that, 1 say, 
"Whatever." Keep pumping out 
the awesome special effects and 
the implausible plot lines - I will 
eat it up. 

And let's not forget the stan-

" It could almost be a drinking game: Drink 
every time a newscaster 
is rendered speechless by 

the magnitude of the 
trauma. Drink when 

someone makes a heroic 
sacrifice ... Drink every 

time an improbable event 
takes place J like the San 
Andreas Fault splitting 

pen " o . 

dard char acte rs. If you think 
people in horror movies are stu-
pid , wait 'til you watch a disaster 
flick. T here's the Adorable Dog 
who is imperiled (ca[S, you see, 
are never in dange r, probably 
because th ey're evil) and is saved 
at the last second from the piles 
of lava plummeting hi s way. 
T hen there's the C ute Kid who 
doesn 't lis ten to h is parents 
despite t he fact that he's in the 
thick of disaster. But fear not, he 
won't be killed off - the Cute 
Kids are never killed off. And 
let 's not fo rget the Dumb 
Politician who doesn't reveal 
what's goi ng to happen for a 
variety o f stupid reasons, most 

notably, he or she doesn't want 
to "create a panic." Because. 
once the asteroids start pelting, 
there won't be any panic at all. 
Then there's the Close Personal 
'Friend/Lover of the main char-
acter who dies tragically, but not 
before clinging to the main char-
acter and telling him or her that 
he or she can save the world. Of 
course. there 's always the stan-
dard Pregnant Lady About To 
Give Birth In the Middle of the 
Disaster and the Bratty Teenage 
Daughter - who I always hope 
will be killed off quickly. The 
main characters, meanwhile. 
always have the correct idea and 
know exactly what's going to 
happen. but no one believes 
them because their ideas are 
inconceivable. As Kim Delany 
declares in "10.5": "They don't 
want answers. they want ellcuses 
.. . All they have to ' do is open 
their eyes." You tell 'em. Kim. 

And while movies like 
"Titanic" could be considered 
part of tbe disaster genre -
since, you know. there are killer 
icebergs - a plot that revolves 
around timeless love ruins the 
entire point of these kinds of 
movies. Plot is secondary. Sure, 
there's the obvious fact that the 
Token Recently Divorced 
Couple of the disaster movie is 
going to get back together. But 
the film doesn 't revolve around 
them. T he fi lm revolves around 
the awesome special effects and 
the la ndmarks being blown up. 

Living in California has given 
me a new appreciation for disaster 
movies. Despite being bllStd on 
the West Coast, Hollywood seems 
to have a thing for getting it 
wrong. Therefore. it's really fun 
when 1 hear things like, "There's 
an 8.4 aftershock in Berkeley!" 
and then see the governor (based 
in Sacramento, of course) not feel 
a thing. Why? Because 1 actually 
approximately know the geogra-
phy, so I know that if there's a 
magnitude 8.4 earthquake in 
Berkeley, people in Sacramento 
will definitely feel it, thus making 
the craptastic feel of the movie 
even better. 1 think my favorite 
line from "10.5" was "I'm autho-
rizing the evacuation of the entire 
West Coast. " Good job, Mr. 
Preside.nt. That will get people 
out of danger. Imagine the traffic 
jams of people getting out of L.A., 
San Francisco, San Diego - and 
that 's JUSt California traffic. 

Beware. The big one is coming.

Troy: Superfluous love story 
countered by deft acting 
conlinued from page 10 

these two leaders-of-men square 
off - their course of action cre-
ates their decision without the 
fallback of the gods - is a plea-
sure. Bana is truly impressive and 
most definitely makes up for some 
of his disappointing earlier roles. 
Orlando Bloom is fine in the 
expanded-just-for-him role of 
Paris, but it seems lik.e the writers 
di'dn't know exactly how to handle 
him. Was he courageous or pas-
sionate or a lothario or what? He 
has a little bit of everything. and 
he has inner-conflict, which is 
nice, but how were the choices 
that he inevitably made influ-
enced by his entire journey? It is 
difficul t to buy the character. 
Peter O'Toole is tremendous in 
his limited role of Priam, Hector's 
and Paris' father; he delivers the 
greatest scene of the film, truly 
touching. 

In addition to the spew-worthy 

counter-love story, there was one 
other annoying element of the 
film: The story of Achilles has 
been around forever, but for some 
reason, the screenwriters and 
directors just had to beat that over 
our poor little heads a thousand 
times before launching into the 
story of the film. Please forgive 
them. they're just trying to do 
their job. And there may be more 
than a few things in this film that 
seem awfully familiar, like some-
thing we all saw in the Battle of 
Helm's Deep in Peter jackson's 
"The Two Towers" ... just remem-
ber that Homer came first .

'Jim Crow' integrates politics and drama lEE 
TAN 

---------1 WEEK 
TANNING 

Theatrical production celebrates Brown v. Board of Education I only $7 
By IESSICA VACHAL 

Staff Writer 

When asked about what inspired him to write his new play, "The Haunting of Jim 
Crow," playwright Allan Havis, 
head of playwriting at UCSD's 
Department of Theatre and Dance. 
said, "Many of my plays have been 
in the direction of political and 
social conflicts. I like to think of 
myself as a political writer." 

Certainly this play is nothing 
shon of a political piece. Written 
to commemorate the 50th anniver-
sary of the 1954 Brown v. Board of 
Educlltirm decision, which invalidat-
ed the "separate, but equal" doc-
trine, this play promises to be a 
truly enlightening and poignant 
evening of theater. Presented as a 
3D-minute staged reading by pro-
fessional actors and master of fine 
arts studen[S, "The Haunting of 
Jim Crow" blends the famous 
Supreme Court ruling with the 
recent revelations about Strom 
Thurmond's mixed-race daughter, 
Essie Mae Washington-Williams. 
T his reading, directed by San 
Diego Repertory Theater's Delicia 
Turner Sonnenberg, promises to 
capture "the tumultuous mood and 
the paradoxica l politics of America 
duri ng the Eisenhower years." 

T hough this script was a com-
missioned piece, Havis said that his 
leanings toward being a political 
writer stemmed (rom his intereS[S 

as a youth. Most prominendy. he 
said that he worked in many inner-
city schools and underprivileged 
summer camps as a college student 
and in years right after coUege. 

"The Haunting of Jim Crow" 
will not be a phenomenon kept 
solely within the confines of 
UCSD. It is scheduled to travel to 
the California Western School of 
Law and to be broadcast on KPBS. 
Each performance at UCSD will 
be followed by a panel discussion. 
Havis will most likely be one of the

18 SPORTS THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Four Tritons earn WWPA recognition 
Bantilan-Smith and Lombardo named to first team 

By DANIEL DIAl 
Senior Staff Writer 

Four members of the UCSD 
women's water polo team were 
rccogmzed for their efforts in the 
2004 season by being named 
Western Water Polo Association 
All -Conference selections, which 
were announced fo llowing the 
tea m 's 7-3 loss to Loyola 
'vlarymoum in the championshi p 
game on pril25 . 

Senior 2-meter defender Meris 
Bantibn- mith and senior goal-
tender Stephanie Lombardo were 
named to the 2004 W\NPA first 
team after playing central roles in 
UCSD's drive to the champi-
onship game for the third consec-
utive year. Junior drivers Jessica 
Wong and Courtney Clevenger 
were awarded honorable men-
tions. Wong led the Tritons in the 
two-day championship tourna-
ment with six goals, followed by 
Banrilan-Smiths four and three 
from Clevenger. 

"Meris did everything for us 
this year and Stephanie was prob-
ably the best goalie in conference 
this season ,~ said UCSD head 
coach Larry Sanders. "Jessica con-
tributed offensively and she had 
more experience on defense, but 
Courtney was active on the coun-

teranack. ~ 
UCSD's four selections were 

second highest, after Loyola 
Marymounts five. UCSD, LMU 
and UC Davis players filled all 
seven first-team spots. LMU's 
Devon Courtney was named 2004 
Player of the Year while her coach, 
John Loughran, won 2004 Head 
Coach of the Year honors. 

"nn selecting players), coaches 
will look at who was a threat to 
their team ... they consider the 
people that you have to shut down 
each game," Sanders said. 

Ten WWPA head coaches 
voted on the weekend of the 
championships. Each manager 
nominated five players for consid-
eration, and the selections were

End of the line: Stephanie Lombardo (I) and Mens Bantilan-Smith (11) 
achieved first team all-WWPA honors in their final season with the Tritons. 
tallied at the end of the final. The 
second team and honorable men-
tion listS we.re well rounded with 
selections from eight teams, but in 
striving for a balanced represenra-
tion, Sanders thought coaches 
may have overlooked the abilities 
of Wong and Clevenger. 

"Jessica and Courtney got hon-
orable mention, but I think they 
were definitely bener players than 
some of those on the second 
team," Sanders said. 

The award ceremony was a 
bittersweet ending for the 
Tritons, who received their indi-
vidual honors immediately after 
their 7-3 championship loss. 
LMU raced to a 4-0 lead by half-
time, and though the Tritons cut 
the lead with goals from 
Bantilan-Smith, Wong and 
Clevenger, they got no closer. It 
was the third consecutive runner-
up finish for the Tritons after 
falling 8-4 and 8-6 to LMU in the 
2002 and 2003 Fhampionships, 
respectively. The Tritons finished ' 
2004 with a 16-20 record. 

"There was a range of emo-
tions, frustration," Sanders said. 
"rrhe championship was) what 
they had always fought for." 

The Tritons can earn more 

recognition when the NCAA 
Division II awards are released 
later this month. UCSD competes 
at the Division I level but is classi-
fied as a Division II team, along 
with other non-scholarship and 
small schools, such as some 
California State University system 
schools. Should Bantilan-Smith 
and Lombardo receive first-team 
nods, then one could be the third 
consecutive UCSD player to cap-
ture Division II Player of the Year. 
Former Tritons Emma Kudritzki 
and Dana Tucker captured that 
honor in 2002 and 2003, respec-
tively. Sanders said that he would-
n't make any predictions. 

"We'll see when it happens," 
Sanders said. 

In 2004, Bantilan-Smith was 
UCSD's linchpin, leading the 
team with 51 goals and 87 steals. 
Clevenger, a junior transfer from 
Sierra College, made an impact 
almost immediatefy upon arrival, 
racking up 30 assists and 27 goals. 
Wong accumulated 26 goals of her 
own and was second on the team 
with 56 steals. Lombardo recov-
ered from a torn labrum to return 
as one of the WWPAS top goalies, 
racking up 238 saves with a 5.59 
goals-per-game average.

Cyn City: UCSD no longer 
just a fall sports school? 
conrinued from PIIce ~o 

props, too. It recendy hosted the 
Triton Invitational with over 800 
athletes competing, including 
Olympic medalists, world champi-
ons and international track and field 
stars. UCSD came up big at home 
and set two school records from the 
men's and women's teams. If you've 
been following the team, you know 
that many track and field athletes 
have been setting school records the 
whole season. Although our men's 
volleyball team missed the playoffs, 
it achieved its best conference record 

since joining the Mountain Pacific 
Sports Federation league in 1993,4-
18. While UCSD will always have to 
contend with national powerhouses 
like Long Beach State, BYU and 
UCLA, it continues to make 
progress. 

Women's crew also had a first this 
season. For the first time, they con-
sistendy placed in the top-five in the 
national rankings and performed 
solidly throughout the season. 

It's been a season of many firsts 
for UCSD athletics. Give the teams 
the credit they deserve. 

Crew: Davis anticipates 
competitive 2005 season 
continued from PIIce ~o 

UCSD's performance qualified 
the varsity eight for the third-
level final race on May 9, in which 
the crew came out to redeem 
itself. 

"We raced again [May 9) and 
took second place," Hardeman 
said. "Our boat started in last place 
for the first thousand [meters) of 
the race, but walked past everyone 
except Holy Cross in the second 
half." 

Holy Cross won the third-level 
finals race by less than 1.5 seconds, 
edging the Tritons, 6:03.061 ro 
6:04.529. The race was by far 
UCSD's best show of the 2004 sea-
son. 

"The [May 9) final was our 
fastest time of the year," Davis said. 
"The team that ended up winning 
the Grand Finals finished in 5:59.5 
to our 6:04.5. That's close." 

The ECAC National 
Invitational Collegiate Regana was 
the last competition for the Tritons 
this seasOD. Hardeman is the only 
graduating senior in the exception-
ally young Triton boat. 

"I was proud to be able to row 
with these guys," Hardeman said. 
"They rowed with a poise and level 

of maturity that was greater than just 
about anyone I've ever raced with." 

Davis said he will be back for 
his second year to coach the team 
as it seeks to improve and contin-
ue to draw national acclaim. The 
2005 season looks promising for 
UCSD, he said 

"It's good to be getting almost 
everyone back," Davis said . "I 
think that we could be one of the 
dominant [Western 
Intercollegiate Rowing 
Association) programs next year 
- not just our varsity eight, but 
out junior varsity and novice pro-
grams, too. I think that it will be a 
goal next year to send more than 
just the varsity boat to the ECAC 
regatta, and instead try to send 
two or three boats." 

Reflecting on the inauguration 
to his coaching career for the 
Tritons. Davis could not have 
imagined a better result. 

"This season was way better 
than I had expected," Davis said. "I 
had a really strong group with a lot 
of good freshmen on the team. 
There is a lot of youth in this pro-
gram. This year was outstanding 
and much bence than anything I 
could have anticipated."

THURSDAY, MAY 13, 2004 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Cross country seniors make l~st dash 
Twelve runners leave UCSD after shining careers 

BY MIOtAEL SOtOEK 
Senior Staff \\\iter 

All of the seniors on the UCSD 
cross countty teams have given per-
formances that led to great success 
for the squads. Those graduating 
will be missed. 

The seniors on the men's cross 
country team are John Burlce, 
Richey Hansen, Neil Kalra, Henry 
L'esperance, John Morrison, Julian 
Nahan and Eric Nilsen. On the 
women's side, the seniors are Katie 
Bunker, Amanda Felder, Lilian 
Gardiner, Julie Pope and Kathy 
Read. 

Kalu was the Tritons No. I 
runner for most of the 2003 cross 
country season. In 2003, he 
earned All-California Collegiate 
Athletic Association honors for a 
second straight year and was an 
All-Region performer in 2002 as 
well. At the season-closing NCAA 
meet, K2lra was the squad's sec-
ond finisher, placing 77th overall 
with a time of 33 minutes, 32.9 
seconds. 

Nahan was also a cross country 
standout who turned in a series of 
outscanding races in last year~ cham-
pionship season, 6nishing first for 
the UCSD men at the same pivotal 
meet. 

At the Nov. 22 CCAA meet, 
Nahan placed an outstanding 45th

nament, where they fell in the 
first round. 

Prior to his time in Mobile, 
Carr spent nine years as an assis-
tant coach at the University of 
San Francisco. During his 9 years 
at USF, he helped develop 10 
first-team All-West Coast 
Conference standouts, including 
the 1998 and 2000 WCC 
Freshmen of the Year. USF 
advanced to the NCAA 
Tournament in 1998 after win-
ning the WCC Tournament title. 

Long Beach State closed out 
the 2004 season with a 6-21 over-
all record, 4-14 in the Big West 
conference. 

in the 176-runner field with a time 
of 32 :45.8 for the 10-kilometer 
event. 

Morrison was a reliable point-
scocer for UCSD. His 22nd place 
perfonnance at the 2003 NCAA 
Division II West Regional with a 
timeofH:23.l helped the men's side 
finish second. 

Hansen was an important run-
ner for the team, placing 26th at 
the 2003 CCAA Championships 
with a time of 26:44.5. This 
helped in giving a top-three finish 
for the men's side at the race. 

Nilsen accomplished a great deal 
over the course of his time as a 
UCSD cross country runner. At the 
CCAA meet, Nilsen rounded out 
the roster for UCSD in l53rd place 
by completing the arduous race in 
35:37.3. 

At the UC San Diego Triton 
Cross Country Oassic on Oct. 12, 
2003, Burke was a signi6cant point-
scorer for his team, earning points' 
for coming in 62nd with a time of 
27:52.9. 

L' esperance was a capable runner 
for the Tritons as well. L'esperance 
came in 55th at the Annual Aztec 
Cross Country Invitational in 
September 2003 with his time of 
28:12 . 
. On the women's side, Gardiner 
was a tintastic leader and her perfor-
mances reflected that. At the NCAA 

meet, Gardiner came in I 18th with 
her time of24:09.3. 

Read has also been a top per-
former for cross country the entire 
2003 seasoo. At the 2003 CCAA 
Championships, Read helped the 
team gain a top-three finish when 
she came in 22nd with her time of 
22:51.2. 

Felder was another consistent 
presence on the women's roster. 
Felder had a 25th-place perfor-
mance at the 2003 NCAA Division 
II West Regional by crossing the 6n-
ish line in 23:26.l. 

Pope made considerable 
improvement over the course of the 
2003 season. At the UC Irvine 
Invitational in September 2003, 
Pope placed 51st with a time of 
20:56. 

Bunlcer came in 66th out of a 
field of 199 competitors at the UC 
San Diego Triton Cross Country 
Classic with her time of 25:09.4. 

With the help of Bunker's pres-
ence at that race, the women's team 
topped five other schools, including 
three CCAA foes, to win the 
Division II tide. 

TIlough UCSD has a young, 
promising group of cross country 
runners, the efforts of the seniors, 
many of whom have been four-year 
veterans of the team, earned UCSD 
a new status as a powerful Division II 
competitor.

have really built up their confi-
dence throughout the season . 
[Hilker) played her best match 
in Florida. She 's still working on 
her volley and net game, but her 
ground strokes are very strong." 

Dao played an impressive 
season at No. 2 singles, losing 
only once during league play 

~nd posting- an overall 7-1 
record in conference matchups. 
Teaming up with senior Julie 
Westerman, Dao went 7 -I at 
No. 1 doubles. 

During the season, McKee 
and Westerman were both 
named California Collegiate 
Athletic Association women's 
tennis Players of the Week for 
their exceptional performances. 

"[Dao) has been really solid 
this year," L~lante said . "She 

has really good concentration 
and is determined not to let 
things bother her. Her strength 
is her mental focus . Even if she's 
not playing her best, she stays 
focused. [Dao) has also per-
formed really well at doubles 
this year." 

Not only were UCSD play-
ers honored by the league, but 
LaPlante was named CCAA 
Coach of the Year. LaPlante 
coached the Triton women to a 
flawless 8-0 league record, giv-
ing UCSD the opportunity to 
host the CCAA Women's Tennis 
Championships at Northview 
Tennis Courts. 

The Tritons finished the sea-
son with an 18-9 overall record 
and were crowned conference 
champions, but were stopped in 
the second round of the NCAA 
tournament by Hawaii-Hilo on 
May 7 to end their season.

against national competition 

Carr named head basketball coach 
Edwards hires fonner Long Beach State assistant coach 

Men's crew completes 
ECAC regatta in 14th place 

By MAn RYAN 
Senior Staff Writer 

UCSD Director of Athletics 
Earl W Edwards announced Bill 
Carr as the new head coach for 
the men's basketball program on 
May 10. This announcement 
ends a six-week vacancy of the 
position. 

By MAnHEW GRANT 
Associate Sports Editor 

The Tritons' men 's crew team 
set its sights on the competition at 
the East Coast Athletic Conference 
National Invi tational Collegiate 
Regana on May 8 and May 9 in 
\Vorce ter, Ma ., in a field of I of 
the' country' fa te t rowing pro-
gram . After preliminaries, UCSD 
was in a dis ouraging 17th place 
overall , but went on to achieve the 
team's faste t race of the season, 
only five seconds behind the overall 
winner, and took 14th place in the 
men's varsity eight division . 

First-year head coach Mark 
Davi sta rted the 2004 campaign 
by having the team establish a 
sene of goals on which to focus 
during the season, rather than try-
ing to dive into every race like it 
wa the team's la t. The result was 
that the var ity eight boat went 
furt her than Davis initially 
thought po sible and demonstrat-
ed that UCSD cannot be over-
looked in di cu ions about which 
programs will oon tOP the 
nation's list of the most esteemed 
regattas. 

'Tfhe EC C regatta) this year 
wa the fa test regatta at this level 
that I've ever been to," Davis said. 
"The boats that were there are all 

so fast that it wasn't an issue of who 
the fastest team was, but who had 
the fastest race that day." 

UCSD took off in the second 
heat of the preliminary races on 
May 8, competing for one of the 
top two positions in order to 
advance to the finals on May 9. 

"It was definitely a close heat," 
senior co-captain Eric Hardeman 
said. "1 don't think that we had our 
best race [on May 8) . If we could 
have done it over, we'd have done·it 
better." 

Due to constantly changing 
conditions, it is difficult to make 
relative comparisons by time in 
crew. The course in Worcester on 
May 8 had a strong headwind that 
slowed leading boats down by 
almost 30 seconds. 

The Tritons crossed the finish 
line at 2,000 meters in 6 minutes, 
30.004 seconds - 2.657 seconds 
behind the second-place finisher 
and Grand Finals qualifier George 
Washington University. Virginia 
won the preliminary heat in a time 
of 6:22.3 87. 

"We were less than three sec-
onds behind the second-place 
boat," Davis said. "We didn't have a 
bad race, but it wasn't our best race 
either." 

See CREW. Page 18 

Carr replaces Greg Lanthier 
as head· coach, who coached the 
Tritons since the 1994-95 season. 
He compiled a 111-149 record in 
his 10 seasons at the helm of the 
Tri ton basketball program and 
directed the team through its 
transition frol1l NCAA Division 
III to Division n. 

After a brilliant season in 
1998-99, when UCSD posted a 
20-5 mark, the Tritons made a 
difficult move to Division II. The 
2003-04 squad was just 9-18 and 
finished 9-11 in California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
play. Lanthier's contract was not 
renewed in March. 

"This is a great oppor!Unity 
for me at UC San Diego," Carr 
said. 

Carr looks to revitali2.e 
UCSD's program and boost the 
team to an elite level by bringing 
strong coaching experience and 
an impressive resume, Edwards 
said. 

"We ar~ extremely excited 
that Coach Carr has agreed to 
join the UC San Diego family," 

Women's tennis players named All-CCAA 
McKee earns Freshman of the Year honors 

By ANGELA LIN 
Staff Writer 

Following the UCSD 
women's tennis team 's success in 
the 2004 season, fou r players 
were named to the All-California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
first team, including Katie 
McKee as conference Fre hman 
of the Year. 

J 1I 11 lOr Jasmi n Dao and 
sophomores Marissa Hilker and 
Leigh Robert were named 
along~lde McKee to the league's 
first team. McKee, who played 
I o. 6 singles throughout the 
season, held a perfect 7 -0 record 
in league play and posted a 6-1 
record at No.3 doubles, playing 
with Roberts. 

"Katie came in as a fairly 
high-ranked player in 
California," head coach Liz 
LaPlante said. "She had a lot of 
tournament experience and good 
fundamentals, but did not have 
that confidence and competitive-
ness at the beginning. We put 
her in some key matches, espe-
cially in Florida, which was her 
turning point, and she improved 
a lot. She is playing aggressively 
and has lots of potential." 

Roberts was flawless in league 
competition and recorded an 8-0 
record at No. 3 singles. In the 
second round of the NCAA 
tournament, Roberts played a 
tough three-setter against 
Hawaii -Hilo, losing the first set, 
2-6, rebounding to win the sec-
ond set, 6-4, then losing the last 
set, 6-0. 

Alternating between No. 4 
and No. 5 singles, Hilker also 
posted a perfect 8-0 record in 
league matches . In the last match

of the season against Hawaii- "Both [Roberts] and [Hilker] 
Hilo, Hilker lead her opponent are super athletes," LaPlante 
6-4, 6-5 before the game was 
called. See TENNIS. Pa,t 19 

Edwards said. "His diverse 
coaching background and knowl-
edge of recruiting, especially on 
the West Coast, made him a very 
logical choice." 

Carr has spent the past 14 sea-
sons coaching collegiate men's 
basketball. He spent the two pre-
vious seasons as the associate 
head coach at Long Beach State. 
Prior to arriving on Long Beach 
State's campus, Carr spent three 
seasons as the head basketball 
coach for Spring Hill College in 
Mobile, Ala. He boasted an 
impressive career mark of 84-23 
(.785) at Spring Hill, leading the 
Badgers to three appearances in 
the National Association of 
Intercollegiate Athletics 
National Tournament. In 2000 
and 2001, Spring Hill advanced 
to the NAIA Elite Eight. Spring 
Hill accurnubted a 41-9 league 
mark in his three seasons and lost 
back-to-back games only once in 
107 games. 

In his first season (1999-00), 
Carr led Spring Hill to a 29-8 
mark, a Gulf Coast Athletic 
Conference championship and a 
trip to the NAIA Tournament, 
where it advanced to the Elite 
Eight. Carr was named the 
GCAC Coach of the Year that 
season and was a finalist for the 
NAIA National Coach of the 
Year. 

Spring Hill finished the sea-
son ranked No. 11 nationally and

was one of the top-rated defen-
sive teams in the NAIA that sea-
son. The 29 victories set a new 
school record as did the 16 
league wins. In 2000-01, the 
Badgers were 29-8 and finished 
No. 12 in the country. 

In his final season at Spring 
Hill (2001-02), the Badgers fin-
ished 26-7, won the GCAC title 
and advanced to the NAIA tour-

UCSD spring sports wrap 
up a season of firsts 

Cynthia Blade Chavez 
There's a first rime for every-

thing. 
The NHL's Tampa Bay 

Lightning, a team many hockey fans 
likened to the NBAS Los Angeles 
Clippers, fought its way to a first-
place firush and reached the confer-
ence finals this year for the first rime 
in franchise history. The PGAS Phil 
Mickelson has finally won .1 major 
tournament, erasing doubts about 
whether he could really win the big 
one. For the first time in a long rime, 
the MLB's Detroit Tigers are actual-
ly playing well, at least according to 
the standings. After flirting with 
baseball's all-time regular season loss 
record, the Tigers are 15-17, almost 
a.500 team. 

If you've been foUowing UCSD 
sports lately - religiously or casual-
ly - you should have noticed that 
our spring sports teaJm have come 
up with surprises of their own. We 
were always mown for our faD sports 
teams, but this spring, our teams 
have given us a good reason for our 
suppan, exceeding expectations. 

BasebaU, for the first time since 
UCSD's move to Division II, came 
up huge at the tail end of the season 
to secure a spot in the playoffs. The 
Tritons were tied for fourth place 
with San Francisco State late in the 
season and needed to win their last 
game to earn a playoff berth. They 
won the games and it was only fit-
ting that a graduating seRiOl', Raf 
Bergstrom, threw a complete game 
to prolong his team's season. The 

Tritons were unfortunately ousted, 
but now they can claim playoff expo-
sure and capitalize on its postseason 
experience next year. 

Women's tennis stonned out at 
the beginning of the season and 
never let up, going undefeated in 
conference play this year. The 
Tritons also captured their first-ever 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association championship 
becoming only the second team 
besides the women's soccer team to 
earn this coveted title. They had a 
solid playoff run, advancing to the 
second round, but unfortunately 
came up just shon to Hawaii-Hilo. 
Don't be surprised to see them take 
a serious run at Nationals next year; 
four players were selected to the 
First-Team A11-CCAA and they are 
all returning students. 

Golf had an awesome season, 
earning its first-ever Division II 
Men's Golf Championships bid 
while consistently maintaining its 
ranking in the top 10. UCSD won 
the Division ill national champi-
onship 11 years ago and it may be 
time for the Tritons to do it apn. 

The UCSD men's tennis team is 
in Florida playing in its fint NCAA 
Division II National 
Championships. After fialling short 
to Hawaii teams in the playoffs, the 
Tritons pounded Hawaii-Hilo to 
earn themselves a trip to Nationals. 
Ths may be their best chance yet 
since they're on a six-match winning 
streak and it's the last year for many 
players on the starting lineup. The 
men's tennis team 8ew to Florida 
feeling confident, and if they contin-
ue the level of tennis they've played 
lately, they can really win it this 
time.
