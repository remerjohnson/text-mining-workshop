Group Suggests 
Song Changes 
ATLANTA, Ga. - A 
Georgia Tech task force on 
diversity recently recom-
mended that changes be 
made to "The Ramblin ' 
Wreck from Georgia Tech," 
the school's fi ght song. 
According to tas k force chair 
Stephanie Ray, the associate 
dean of students, task force 
members objected to the allu-
sions to alcohol in the song 
and the way it portrays 
women. The song first 
appeared in The Blueprint , 
the school's yearbook, in 
1908 under the titl e "What 
Causes Whitlo k to Blush." 
The most notable appearance 
of the song was du ring Ni xon 
and Kruschev 's Kitchen 
Debate - the only song the 
two leaders both knew was 
the "Ramblin' Wreck from 
Georgia Tech."

Founder and CEO of Qualcomm Incorporated announced, 
with his w~feJ their gift to the School of Engineering 

By KI-Mln Sung 
Gu ardian Reporter 

Irwin Jacobs, the CEO and 
founder of Qualcomm , 
Im:orporated, along with hi s 
wife Joan Jacobs, announced 
Monday their donati on of $ 15 
million to support the UCSD 
School of Engineering. 

In recognition of their gen-
erosity, Chancellor Robert 
Dynes will recommend the UC 
Board of Regents rename the 
School of Engineering the Irwin 
and Joan Jacobs School of 
Engineering. . 

This is a precedent-sett ing 
gifl. In addition to being the 
largest one-time pri vate dona-
tion to UCSD, the School of 
Engi neering will be the first 
s hool to be named aft er a 
donor. 

"We feel very trongly about 
educati on in general, engineer-
ing in parti cular," Jacobs said. 
" It is important to us that the 
School of Engineering continue 
to build and improve further 
momentum as far as being an 
excellent school for research, 
for education of the students, 
and supporting the community 
and industry all around us." 

U President Ri chard 
Atkinson also attended the 

announcement. 
"From the fo unding of 

UCSD, Irwin and Joan Jacobs 
have contributed tremendously 
to the success of the un iversity," 
he said. "Today, their splendid 
gift represents a great opportu -
nity to grow and enhance our 
engineering programs to meet 
the emerging demands of 
Californi a's high-technology 
industries." 

Atkinson said he hopes that 
future generations wi ll recog-
ni ze the Jacobs for their impor-
tance in the evolution that has 
occurred wi thin engineering. 

School of Engineering Dean 
Robert Conn said engineers are 
an integral part of the work 
fo rce and wi ll continue to be so 
fo r years to come. 

"Today 's healthy economy 

needs the products of th'e school, 
a hi ghly skilled work force and 
scientific di scoveries. to sustain 
and fuel economi c growth," 
Conn said . 

Conn also said he seeks to 
utilize these resources to sup-
port new ideas from the UCS D 
fac ulty and to make stronger 
proposa ls for future projects. 

To achieve such growth , the 
School of Engineering plans -
by the 2003-04 academic year 
- to increase the number of 
fac ulty members from 11 4 to 
150, double the number of grad-
uate students to 1,000, and near-
ly double the $7 1 million budget 
to $125 million. Thc number of 
enrolled undergraduate students 
wi ll remain steady.

The A.. ouncil la .. t night upheld

copi es of two issues, A.S. Vice 

Pre~ ident Finance Tony Fiori and

Valeri e Grant said . 
Although it wi ll not be funded thi s 

qua1"ler, the paper wi ll be eligible to 
reappl y for fi nancial support nex t 
quarter. 

Becausl.! the publ ication went over 
it s budget and "misused student 
funds," Grant and Fiori said they 
chose not to fund the paper for winter 
quarter. 

Voz Fronteriza members 
appealed the decision to the A.S. 
finance committee," which voted 1-6, 
with one abstention, aga inst the pub-
li cation. 

Voz Fron/eriza editors- in-chief 
Benjamin Prado and Angelica 
Ramirez acknowledged in a letter to 
the A.S. Council that they did "print 
out of our specifications," but that the 
paper did not abuse student funds. 

"We would like to respond by rec-
ognizing that the Voz used the fund-
ing that was allocated to us by the 
A.S . for printing," the letter stated. 
"Therefore, (we) did not misuse stu -
dent funds." 

The editors and 'everal staff mem-
bers of Vo;: Frollferiza, as well as 
members of other campus Chicano and 
Latino studcnt organizations, appeared 
before the A.S. Council during the 
public input peri~ at last night ' 
meeting. 

Audience members who were 
aga inst the committee's decision 
expressed their concern that appeal's 
failure was evidence of the A.S. 's att i-
tudc toward the publication . . 

"This is a direct rac i t attack on Voz 
Fronteriza," said staff writer Cri stina 
Ramfrez. "The A.S. is here for tu -
dent , not for attacking tudents."

'High Hopes' Reaches Out 
To Minority Students 

Pres ide nt Bill Clinto n recently introduced hi s 
High Hopes initi ative, which seeks to prepare and 
attract low-income students to higher education. 

High Hopes would provide $ t40 million in g rants 
toward forming partnerships between colleges, com-
munity groups and middle schools. Hopefully, this 
will raise the expectations o f low-income yo uth and 
encourage them to stay in school and eventually 
aHend college. 

As affirmative- action programs di sappear across 
the country, the initiative is a positive sign that the 
pres ident is taking definitive steps to ensure that 
America's universities continue to e nroll students 
from underrepresented racial -minority groups. 

Clinton 's has modeled the initi ative after seve ral of 
the Unive rsity of Californi a's current outreach pro-
g rams, including the Berke ley Pledge, a statewide K-
12 outreac h organi zation launched by UC Be rke ley 
in September 1995. 

We applaud Pres ident C linton and the University 
of Californi a for taking an acti ve role in pre paring 
and recruiting students wl~o have traditionally been 
underrepresented in colleges . 

Furthe rmore, we encourage the Uni versity of 
Californi a to continue to be a hotbed of new outreach 
proposals. It is refreshing to be acknowledged for 
sQmcthing. other than academic excellence. 

Campus Should Have 
Been Prepared for Floods 

UCSD was cau ght totally unpre pared fo r EI 
Nino's fury las t week. Afte r Friday ' s heavy ra ins, 
more than 20 buildings on campus re ported some 
leve l of fl ooding - the most se ri ous be ing the 
G e isel Library. 

Our campus is not construc ted fo r rain . Friday's 
rain rema ined on the g ro und because the run-off 
fro m recentl y mu Ic hed areas o f campu s ove rfl owed 
the increas ing ly inadequate drainage syste m. 

Future e ffort s should be made by the omnipotent 
Campus Planning Committee to provide an ade-
quate drainage sys te m thro ughout our sc hool. 

Thi s is the second time in three years tha t the 
Ge isel Library has fl ooded . Obvi ous ly, some thing 
needs to c hange in o rder to prevent future fl ooding. 

Even if the appropriate campu s departments 
wcre info rmed o f pl ans for di saste rs, the infonna-
ti o n was n ' t di sseminated to students and othe r cam -
pus groups. As Californi a braces for the next wave 
o f kunda la ni -like storms thi s upcom ing weeke nd, 
our campu s needs to be prepared when di saste r 
strikes.

IGNORANCE, FEAR AND 
INSECURITY FEED RACISM 

COMMENTARY: Recent encounter prompts one student to question why blatant 
forms of raci sm are unchecked in a society that purports to be more enlightened 

G RAe E 
JAN G 
Against The Grain 

Sometimes, we are fortunate to 
happen upon ewnts thai provoke wilh-
in us the need to challenge, question 
and refute the powers and (.; i r(.;um-
stances thai be. 

In the process of seeking the 
answers, we comc to beller understand 
ourse l ves, not onl y as an " I," bUI as 
pllnicipants in an interconnected soci-
cty comprised of a whole web of "I"s. 

We come to further appreciate the 
concept of "society" and the role it 
pl ays in the lire of every "I:' Hence, 
ttlC urgency of a need for a more pro-
gn.:ssivc society (Bear with me; I' ll 
illustrate my point ). 

I have hccn hlessed by such an 
event - only in retrospecl, though, 
because at the lime, I would have said 
I was "cursed" ra ther than "blessed."

Ill y fr iend in San Francisco's Union 
Square ..:.... th ree middle-dass, Asian 
Amcrican women panaking in the 
capitalis ti c ga la of Christmas con-
sumerism in San Francisco. Nothing 
oul of the ordinary, ri ght? 

Then he came along. 
A red-faced whit e man walked pur-

posefull y toward my fri end. Poinl ing 
his fat finger into her face, he bel-
lowed. "Are YO fi an American citi zen"!" 

Completely laken aback and caught 
off guard, she replied, "Yc , I am an 
American citizen." 

She quickly recovered and added 
emphatica lly, "Fucker.'· 

Needless to say, our mood was 
altered for the remainder of the night.

The method he 
employed to 
safeguard his

to that which a bully

months later. my pulse still races - in 
anger, in di shcl ief, in confusion. 

Si nce then, I have been contemplat-
ing: Why? Why in San Francisco, 
where Asians comprise a signi licant 
and influential portion of the popula-
tion? Why did he say that? 

The obvious answer is racism - il 
is the most readily available. blanket-
term respon e_ I have concluded, how-
ever, that the issue is much more com-
plicated - yet, it is also very si mple. 
He was scared. 

Li ving in a society in which stereo-
types form the basis of our percepti ons 
of each other, the man no doubt 
be lieves that "illegal immigrants" are 
to blame fo r hi s problems. Because 
Asian Americans bear all the marks as 
Ihe "foreigner with in" in our ye llow 
skin, our blal:k hair, our slanted eyes, 
we make easy largets for those whites 
who fee l disempowered. 

His blatantly racist allack stems 
from fear - fear of the unknown, fear 
th at these "foreigners" will take from 
him what he perceives to be so lely his.

Asian Americans as the up-and-
coming "model minority" (a media-
induced myth) pose as a "Ihreat" to the

He fell compelled to prolect his 
"property," i.e. the once unchallenged 
not ion that whiles arc "superi or" and 
hold the exclusive ri ght to monopoli ze 
every thi ng - the state, the education 
system, real estate and, most impor-

He acted ou t of fear thaL everyth ing

As we ncar SI. Valentine's Day, 
il is time to devote a co lumn to one

This magical thing to which I

can be only one thing: meal. 

There is absolutely nothing in 
the world that compares to catching

Before I get too much static for 
waxing so emotional over a food 
group, consider the reactions expe-
riem:ed by most women when one 
even menti ons the word "choco-
late." 

I read in one magazi ne article 
that some women described the 
pleasure they obtained fro m eating 
chocolate as "orgasmi l: ." That 
result was seemingly buttressed by 
an e- mail I received some time ago 
li sting 20 reasons why chocolate is 
better than sex - it was amusing. 
and it was definil ely a female's per-
spective. 

Women prefer the sweet taste 
and smooth, silky texture of foods 
like chocolate for their consump-
tive pleasures. 

We men prefer higher protein 
and foods higher in salt, like a good 
steak to titillate our tas te buds. 

Whether determined by genetics 
or some other mechanism, that is, 
generall y, the truth. 

However. these preferences are 
ironic. While men lend tQ need 
more protein than wo men do 
hel:ause they have more muscle 
mass, they need less iron Ihan do 
women. There arc preliminary 
fi ndings that continually ingesting 
too much iron can have negative 
long-term effects on a man's 
health. 

Women tend to shun red meat 
more often and in grealer numbers 
than men because of the media 
attack on those beloved steaks as 
cholesterol- and fat-composed

eyes because .3 lot of people don't 
have hope in going to college any-
more," Coleman said. " It opens 
the door and says that people.: want 
you at our school s. There are a lot 
of students, administrators and 
faculty that want these students 
herc." 

Participating students attended 
threc groups of workshops 
throughout the day. The lirst ses-
sion addressed. admissions, finan-
cial aid, seholarships and college 
life. 

The second session addressed 
the wide range of career possibili-
ties.

addressed contemporary issues, 
including hip-hop music and 
male/female relationships.

for the students 
working on it, and 
they do a phe-
nomenal job at 
it," WeIch said.

Taka For'Two 
Japanese cui ine and MickJagger 

By Marc Comer 
Slaf( Wrirer 

With a pleasant milieu, excel -
lent Japanese cuisine and Mick 
Jagger sitting less than ten feet 
away, Taka provided a wonderful 
evening of fine dining. 

Localed in Ihe Gaslamp Dis-
trict, Taka's ambiance is nice, but 
leaves something to be desired. 
Ha ving little or no Japanese 
theme, the restaurant instead con-
centrates on the food . 

Though rathcr small , Taka 
allows for both indoor and out-
door dining with additional seat-
ing along a lengthy sushi bar, giv-
i ng you the chance to watch 
skilled hands roll fresh sushi . 

Gerald Syiliester/Guardian 
Sal.a: Patrons enjoy an aperitivo and spicy conversation with a friendly bartender. Cafe Sevilla 's 
menu includes 40 tapas to complement the authentic Spanish ambiance. 

Like most Japanese restau-
rants, Taka offers the basks of hot 
tea and miso soup and an ex ten-
sive li st of sushi. Its li st of entrees 
is quite phenomenal, including 
several wonderfu l seafood di shes 
and even filet mignon. 

Downtown at Cafe Sevilla 
Spice up Valentine's Day with gourmet Spanish food and dancing Offering both full and half orders on its entrees, Taka is the 

perfect place for light eaters who 
enjoy gourmet Japanese food . By Eve Senuty 

Guardian Reporter 
Neslled deep among the myriad 

or predictable Italian restaurants in 
San Diego's Gaslamp Quaner lies a 
welcome change: Cafe Sevilla . . 

This charming eatelY, is home to 
traditional Spanish-style cooking 
served in an enchanting indoor 
Piltio (comple.te with a black-lit 
slarry ceiling shining overhead). 

Cafe Sevilla boasts /I Ircmen-
dous tapas bar. For those unfamil-
iar with Spanish cooking, tapas are 
plates of small appelizer-portions, 
suitable for sharing with that spe-
cial someone. 

When palrons are done with 
their meal. Cafe Sevi lla also hosts a 
salsa dub nexl door. 

Upon visiting Cafe Sevilla, one 
is immediately struck by the festi ve 
dining ambiance. Guests arc seated 
at wooden benches where two peo-
ple can si t next to each olher com-
fortably alongs ide the intricate 
mural -adorned wall depicting a 
Spanish plaza in the evening. 

Guests are quickly treated to a 
hot basket of fresh bread accompa-
nied by alioli - a garlic spread -
and Andalusian tomato sauce ($1 
with any tapa). Start off with the 
tortilla especial, a tasty potato 
quiche with egg, onion, saffron and 
cheese ($4.95). 

After your empty basket of 
bread is whisked away and 
replaced by a warm, fresh one: try 
the crepas de morisco.I·, a delicious 
blend of clams, mussels and shrimp 
served in a crepe and topped with a 
light and creamy lobster sauce 
($6.75). The sauce will quickly 
come in handy as dipping sauce for 
your newly replenished bread. 

The croquetas de gambas - or 
diced-shrimp croqaettcs ($4.95) -
are breaded and formed into bile-
sized ball s. Althoug h a bit on the 
dry side, they are a fun and tasty 
treal. 

Follow it up with albondigas al 
jerez ($5.50), three seasoned meat-
balls served in a rich sherry sauce 
- Ihey arc both large and tasty 

with a bit of a zip. The sherry sauce 
is rich and flavorful and can also be 
used as a dipping sauce for your 
third basket of bread. 

Avoid the gambos a La planclul 
- grilled shrimp in a butter sauce 
($6.75). They arc tasteless and 
uninteresting. Also not worth 
ordering is the polio aL ajillo, 
chicken in a wine garlic sauce 
($5.75). The chicken is tough, dry 
and fatly while the sauce is bland. 

Finish off your meal with one of 
two dessens: the chocolate mousse 
crepes ($4.95) or the Andalusian 
apple tan ($6.50). Presentation. an 
imponant part of Cafe Sevilla's 
allure, is definitely not spared on 
the dessens. 

The crepes are attractively pre-
sented on a large plate, decorated 
with chocolate-sauce swirls and 
shapes atop vanilla cream. It is the 
taste, though, that wi ll blow diners 
away. 

The Andalusian apple tan wins 
hands down as far as presentation 

See SEVILLA, Page 18 

The restaurant also offered a 
number of sapid Japanese appe-
tize rs and a decadent li st of 
unique desserts. 

Taka's presentation was extra-
ordinary. Each dish, including 
desen, had its own attitude, mak-
ing it almost too pretty to eat. 

The food at Taka is what it's 
all about. The hot tea, served in 
hefty ceramic mugs, is good and 
the miso soup is also very tasty, 
though somewhat different than 
other Japanese restaurants. 

The almond salmon, though 
tasting more of almonds than 
salmon, is superb, and the Shabu 
Shabu, strips of beef laid over a 
ball of ice and decorated to look 
like a fi sh, is also delightful.

Served atop of half a frozen 
orange laced with slices of mango 
and orange and topped with 
blackberries, the mango ice 
cream danced with Ilavor. 

After Mr. Rolling Stone 
entered, the closed sign was di s-
played, so don ' t expect to get in 
after a celebrity walks in. Then, 
soon after fini shing dessert, the 
host presented the bill. 

For the quality of the dining, 
Taka's prices are above average, 
but not overboard. Expect to 
extract heavily from the ATM. 
Also, wear something a bit dressy 
- though some people wear 
jeans. 

Overall, Taka is an excellent 
place to take your loved one for 
Valentine's Day, just not thi s year. 
Tak.a is most likely booked 
through Sunday; it was even busy

Nonsensical Theatre Rocks UCSD 
Filth, sex, murder and dirty words take the stage in 'Ubu Rock' 

By Adam Vadnais 
Guardian Reporter 

What happens when you take 
the best talent UCSD's theatre 
department has to offer, and then 
make the actors run arou nd on 
stage like drunken 12-year-olds 
stri cken wit h Tourett.e 's syn-
drome? 

Well Ubu happens, actuall y -
"Ubu Rock," that is. 

UCS D's lalest main-stage pro-
duction, "Ubu Rock," opens today 
at Mandell Weiss Theatre whether 
you are ready or not. 

You mi ght be thinking , 
"What 's the big deal ?" Well , how 
many plays can you name off-
hand, whose opening num ber 
invol ves a chorus line singing olle 
lyri c: "SHIT." In fact the entire 
song goes like th is: "Shil, shit , 
SHIIIITT, shi l... .. 

"Ubu Ro(;k" Direc tor Michael 
Schwartz (whose credits include 

last year's uber-sexy "Don Juan") 
sa id , " 1 love doi ng plays that 
appeal to a younger crowd, say, 
their mid-20s, that mix things up. 
Most plays written are for a crowd 
in their mid-60s ." 

"Uhu Rock" itself is a musical 
vcrs ion of the 1896 play "U bu-
Roi" (French for Ubu king), hy 
Jarry. This plot is about Pa Ubu, 
an offi cer in the Polish Army, and 
hi s wife, Ma Ubu . 

Ma and Pa Ubu lack morals , 
man ners and personal hyg iene. 
They decide that their world 
would be considerab ly better off 
if they were in charge. Thus, they 
hatch a plot to ki II the king of 
Poland. 

" It 's sort of a nasty parody of 
' Macbeth, .. ' Schwartz said . 
"When it was first produced in 
Paris back at the turn of the (;entu-
ry, it caused a riot over the lan-
guage." 

It 's hig hl y doublful that any 
riots wi ll occur in La Jo lin over 
the subj ec t matter of "Ubu Rock." 
but if audiences go in ex pecting a 
night al the opera, they wi 11 be 
great ly confused - to say the 
leas t. 

Perhaps the besl way to experi -
ence thi s play is to completely lei 
go of any preconceptions of what 
theat re is supposed to be, and 
at tempt ro gleefu lly wa llow in the 
filth along with Ihe ac tors. It also 
he lps (sort ot) if one fi nds the 
concept of Poland , in and of itself, 
funny. 

The cost umes, designed by 
Janet Peller (who also designed 
the costumes for "Mountain 
Giants"), are quite a sight , though. 
It 's almost worth the rather steep 
$ 12 ticket to see the czar of Rus-
sia in a pink nightie.

Don That Tux The Oscars Are Around The Corner 
'Titanic'and Nicholson set nomination records; the world awaits the Mar 23 announcement of the winners 

By Leena Shankar 
Senior Staff Writer 

The Academy Awards frenzy officially began 
Tuesday at 5:30 a.m ., as over 400 repo rt ers 
crowded at Ihe A cad em y of MOl io n Pi c ture Ans 
and Scie nces' Samue l Goldwyn Theater to hea r 
the no minatio ns announcement fo r the 70th 
annual Academy Awards. 

" Tilanic" sai led c lear pa st the competitio n 
with a record - lying 14 nominati o ns - " All 
Ahout Eve" has he ld the record of 14 nomina-
ti o ns since 1947 . " L.A . onfidential" received 
the seco nd-grea tesl numher of nominations wi th 
a g rand tota l of nine, includi ng Kim Basinger for 
B est Suppuning AClress . 

Academy Presidenl Robert R c hmc and Gecna 
Davis, an O sca r winner in 1988 for Be~ t Sup-
porting Actress, co-announced the nominees for 
nine of Ihe 24 categories . The film s up for Bes t 
Picture are " A, Good As It Gels," " The Fu ll 
M o nty," "Good Will Hunting," "L.A. Confiden -
lial" and "Titanic." 

Best AClOr n omi nees are Mall Damo n in 
"Good Will Hunting," Rohert Duvall in ''The 
Apostle, " Peter Fonda in "U lee's Gold," Dust in 
Hoffman in " Wag the Dog" and Jack Nichobon 
in "As Good A~ It Gets." Best Actress nominees 
arc H elen a B onham Carter in "The Wings of the 
Dovc ," Julie Christ ie in "Afterglow," Judi 
Dren ch in " Mrs. Brown," Helen Hunt in "As 
G ood As It Gets" and Kate Win slet in "Titani c". 

Damon also col lected a second Oscar nom i -
nation in Be~t Screenplay for "Good Will Hunt -
ing." The sto ry behind th e birth of this m ov ie is 
almost a screenpl ay in it self. Damon and ac tor 
B en Affleck, who co-wrote the sc reenp lay, gr ew 
up in BoslOn as friends si nce the third g rade. The 
talc of misu nderstood youn g genius Will Hunt -
ing o ri ginated a Damon ' s 50- page writing 
as~ignment for a course he too k as a sludent at 
Harvanl Later, as he and Arfleck we re stru g-
g ling to find a good sc ript and r o le, they decid-
ed to base th eir own screenpla y upo n th e writing 
assignment. 

" In Ihe beginning, ' Good Will Hunting' was 
jusl t wo struggling ac tors s itting down 10 try 
their h and at writing," Damon sa id . "The 
thought Ihat a ll o r thi s wou ld lead us to work 
with Gus Van Sant o r Rohin Willi ams never 
cro,sc d ou r mind~ . EverYlhing thal '~ happened 
and th e way people have re,pondcu 10 o llr work 
is prell y amat.i ng." 

icholson. w ith hi s 11th acting nominalion 
this year, ,et~ the record for m osl nOlllination~ 
for a male perrormcr. The record was previously 
held by Laurence Olivier, who had 10 in hi s life-
time. Only Katherine Hepburn, wilh 12, has had 

more nominations as a performer. 
There were few surprises in 

the nominations themselves . 
Though the Best Picture 
nomination for "The Full 
M o nty" was unexpec l ed , most of 
the nominal io ns were predi ctable . 
The A ca d emy nomination s overlapped 
with many o f the Golden Glohe nomination s, 
despite th e obvious and disappointing excepti on 
of Leonardo Di Caprio fur Best Actor in ''Tilan -
ic ." 

Th e Academy also clearly fell Ihat 1997 was 
the year for comebacks. Peter Fonda, Burt 
R eynold s ( Be~ t uppuning Aclor for "Boo\!ie 

ights"). Julie Chrislie and Gloria SlUan ( Besl 
Supporfing Actress for "Titanic") have all been 
nominated for Oscars thi s year. 

Interesting 10 nOle is Ih al Ihi s firs l lime in 
A cademy hi story in which two performers ha ve 
been nominated for play ing the same character 
in the same year - buth Kate Winslet and Glo-
ria Stuart are contenders for their porlrayal of 
Rose DeWili Bukater in ·'Titanic." 

If the recent years show a trend in Best Pi c -
lure winners , " Titanic" will have a good chance 
at takin g home the Oscar in Marcil. Wilh a run -
ning time of over Ihree hours, "Titanic" i s an 
unu sually long movie, jUM ai> the winners for 
B cs t Picture have heen for the past few ye ars. 
Last year, " Th e English Pali ent" took home Ihe 
ho nor. " Braveheart " won in IlJlJ S, "For res t 

ump" won in 1994 and "Sc hinuler 's Li,, " 
received th e O sca r for B esl Pi clUre in 1993. 

Produ cers of lo ng movies arc fa ced wil h Ihe 
difficult task o r keeping their audience ' inl creSI -
cd. When films slich as Ihese succeed in ca pti -
va ting the audi ence for we ll ove r two hOllrs. they 
usually h ave multi -dimensional pl o ts and exce l -
lenl charac ter portray al s. 

The Academy no minatio n announcemenfS 
w ent sm ool hl y, with onl y a few surp ri ses. Per-
h aps th e strangest part of the 15-mi nute 
announcem en t ceremo ny occurred al th e end of 
the announcem ent for th e Be,t Actor nominees. 
A member of the audience began yelli n g, " Whal

His c ri es actually dro wned o ut the annou nce-

out of the themer hy a sec urity g uard . Lat er, he

Selling Out Can Be Romantic 
Valentines Day isn't about love anymore (or maybe it never was) 

By Dan Streeter 
Staff W(lter 

When I was a~kcd to WI ite an 
article on my thoughts about 
Valentine\ Day, I fe lt many differ-
ent thing~. At fi rst I was excited 

bccau~e I ha ve a ~trong bclief that 
Valentinc 's Day is a pathetic 
excuse for a holiday and I want to 

~hare that wi th all 01 you. Then I 
became apprehcnsi ve, because I 
am in a re l a t ion~hip. 

How can I sincerely write an 
article that pimp-s laps the one day 
dedicated to romance when I am 
in vo lved in a fulfilling, life· 
enhanci ng relati IIship? I so lved 
thi s dilemma by reaching back into 
my past. There, in the repressed 
memories of romance gone bad, I 
hoped to find the one thing that 
would propel thi s article along. 

I let my thoughts flow. Phrases 
and images swa m through my 
head : 

"Let's just be friends. It's not 
yOll . Really, it 's me. We just aren ' t 
compatible. I don 't rea ll y like men 
that much. Can ' have your sister's 
~umbe~? Please, stop cryi ng. I' m 
leaving now. Give me my keys. 
Did 1 mention I have pepper 
spray '?" 

Finally, , know how I can do 
this. I' ll tap my deeply repressed 
bitterness toward anyonc and 
everyone who has refused the 
wonders of my love. No time for a 
list now, so let's move on . 

What is Valent ine's Day really 
all about? In its current fo rm, 
Valentine's is very special because 
it is the on ly day out of the year 
when most guys can shake some 
action wit hout a bott le of Bo·one's. 

., 
80 Valrftliru/ <; Day 
became a Western 
holiday so thallh l? 
Catholic Church could 
control son w pagans. 

tglrl ~ it iJecame (/ 
romantic holiday so that 

Jlallrnark could I'1wl:r 
nlor(J nlOI1PY. JVonr of 
IfLPse are (J'Qod rrac;ons 
10 like the holiday. /I:C; 
about prqfit and control, 
Hoi (WOU t lO lJr (Or 
nwyhe tl lC/.I is low?). 

., 
However, the holiday 's origins go 
back much further than that. It 's a 
twisted, bitter story. but here is the 
ultra-condensed, could-be-true, 
run-on sentence version. 

Some innocent and freedom-
loving pagans had a semi-romantic 
holiday that coincided with the 
anniversary of the martyrdom of 
Saint Va lentine. This practice was 
co-opted firs t by the Catholic 
church to red uce pagan practices 
and later co-opted by greeting-card 
companies and norists in a Profit-
maki ng scheme. This was so that 
some guy, not necessarily me, 
would have to buy overpriced 
roses and a sweet litt le card for 
some girl who is just going to 
dump me and go after his sister. 
Okay, okay, it was me, but damnit, 

it sti II hurts. 
o Valentine'~ Day became a 

Western holiday so that the 
Catholic Church could control 
some pagans. Later, it became a 
romantic holiday so that Hallmark 
could make more money. None of 
these arc good reason s to likc the 
holiday. It 's abou t profit and con-
trol , not about love (Or maybe that 
is love'!). 

The warped moti vcs behind 
Valentinc's Day only lead to a sad 
and tragic spiral of self-loathing, 
romantic co nfusion, mani c 
depress ion , . nli -social hehavior 
and rented movies. And that onl y 
goes J'or the people with dates. 
What about everyone else? Who 
is go ing to speak out for the tor-
mented souls that Saint Valentine 
left bchind? 

Well , in the tradition of Valen-
tine's Day, this articlc will ignore 
these peop le all togeth er. ow, 
back to the people who actually 
need to worry about Valentine's 
Day. 

Consider the symbols oJ' Valen-
tine 's Day. The most enduring sign 
of the holiday are those crappy lit-
tle cards and foul -tasting lill ie 
message hearts that say cute things 
like "Kiss me," "Let 's date," and "I 
heart vulva." Okay, they don ' t 
really mention vu lva, bu t I really 
thought the Guardian should prin t 
that word at least once. 

Anyway, candy hearts and 
paper cards suck. Giving these out 
is li ke saying "Happy Valent ine's, 
honey, I hope you like crap." How 
can anyone enjoy a holiday like 
this'?

Can You Believe This Guy's Taken? FREE 
COPIES Valentines Day tip (or the lonely, desperate and mildly psychotic 

By Brendan Cahill 
Senior Staff Writer 

Okay, ~o at tl1\: last stafr mcet-
ing, they asked for ideas ror Valen-
IIne's Day-re lated s t orie~ . Joking-
ly, I s u ggc~lI.:d that we do somc·

ways to get some on V-day. Teach

The Aw·Shucks Poet Routine

some nowcrs and rip-ofT some 
Shakespeare sonnets . With any 
luck, your target will just swoon

The "Come Up And See My ... " 
Stratagem 

This, of course, assumes that 
you have frie nds, acquai ntances or 
at least know people who don't 
hate your guts, and, specifica ll y, 
that you have acquaintances you 
would like to bonk. 

Thi s is a simple lure that can 
work many di fferent ways, and is 
therefore foo lproof in that it is 
unpredictable. Sugges t that the 
two of you go out on a lillie anti -
V-day thing (di nner, movie, what-
ever - your mind will be e lse-
where, so it doesn't mailer what 
you actually do) - j ust to do 
someth ing to fo rget about the 
Hallmark Holiday. 

Then fi nd some reason to get

• .you like to come up and see my hi-
fiT is always a classic. "Would 
you like to come up and see my 
etchings?" works just as well. '" 
have to check my messages" is 
probably the most innocuous. 
The "Quality Tlme~ Maneuver 

What many people do not 
understand is that there is a differ· 

ence between "stal l,.ing" and 
"quality time." Follow your targ.:t 
around for a while and get an idea 
of thei r pallerns - whcre they arc 
when, what dasses they have, 
where they do their grocery shop-
ping, etc. 

Sure, thi s is a lot like sta lking, 
hut if you really care about the 
persoll , then it 's okay. Once you 
have establi shed their schedule, 
coincidentally show up in all the 
places they frequent at exa~tly the 
right time. Funny meeting you 
here - again. 

Soon, they' ll ei ther rail in love 
(and into the ack) with you. or 
fi le a restraining order. 
The Whlte·Collar Crime High 
Road 

This technique invo lve ' a bit of 
applied know ledge, but, hey, 
you' re a college student - you 
must have learned something here. 

People talk a lot of jazz about 
how secure ne.w computer systems 
are. Bah! Any second-year CSE 
major can get you in to the student 
database and then bam! you' re in . 

Get the exact low-down on 
their class schedule and then meet 
them after every class. 

This technique shou ld precede 
the "Quality Ti me" Maneuver. 
The TJ TechnIque 

This one's easy. Go to Tijuana 
(Pacific Beach can be substituted 
if you can' t get aeross the border). 
Have sex wi th someone.

Movie Revieww-- ·----

Dickens' Characters Live On 
Overly hyped movie does not live up to 'Great Expectations' 

By Matthew Kalinowski 
Staff Writer 

For about the price of "Cliff's 
Notes," th ose people who are 
scared off by the massive volume 
and archaic language of Charles 
Dickens' novel, "Great Expecta-
tions," can just check out the 
movie. 

Actua lly, this modem version is 
only loosely based on the novel, for 
beller or worse. The movie falls 
somewhere in bet ween decent and 
prelly good, depending on how 
great your expectations are, given 
that Mex. ican direc tor Alfonso 
Cunron had a great cas t but 
mediocre script to work with. 

The coming-of-age romance 
introduces us 10 IO-year-o ld 
Finnegan Bell who lives in Florida 
wi th his promiscuous big sister 
and her ris herman boyfri end, 
"Uncle" Joe (Chri s Cooper). Finn 
passes the time by drawi ng pic-
tures of Gulf Coast wi ldl ife in the 
marshes.

Heartfelt: Anne Bancroft, as the wealthy eccentric Ms. Dinsmoor, 
enlists the aid of young Finn (Jeremy James Kissner). 

One day Fin n is violen tly 
accosted by a convict (Roben 
DeNiro) who forces the boy to aid 
hi s escape from prison. 

Soon afterwards, a crazy-but-
rich old woman, Ms. Dinsmoor 
(Anne Bancroft), hires Finn as a 
playmate for her snobbish nie,e 
Estell a. Ms. Dinsmoor, abandoned 
at the altar decades ago, trains 
Estell a to break hearts, using Finn 
to practice on. As teenagers. Estella 
suddenly leaves for Europe without 
telling Finn, who has had a huge 
crush on her ever since they met. 

Courtesy of Twentieth Century Fox/ Phillip Caruso 
Surprise Visit: A convict. Lustig (Robert De Niro) coerces young 
Finn (Jeremy James Kissner) to help in his escape. 

A few years later, an unnamed 
benefactor sends Finn to New York 
to become a big-time painter. On,e 
there, the now grown-up Finn 
(Ethan Hawke) and Estella 
(Gwyneth Paltrow) meet again , 
onl y for Fi nn to discover that she is 
engaged to be married. 

Finn becomes a big-time artist, 
earning fame, wea lth and status. 
hut in t he process forgets hi s hu m-
ble roots and still doesn' t have the 
only thing he rea lly wants. 

The rest of the IiIm features 
interaction hetween Finn and Estel-
la. and a surpri se twist toward the 
end (unless you've already read the 
book). 

The screenplay is a good mod-
erni zation of the 19th century 
novel, but passes over much of 
Dickens' subtle character develop-
ment. As a result, the characters 
remain two-dimensional , so it 's 
harder for the audience to really 
sym pathile with them. 

On the other hand, there's only 
so much a movie can accomplish in 
an hour-and-a-half. 

The film hites off more than it 
can swallow, attempting to tackle 
some big themes like love, control, 
dassism and growing up, yet fail s 
to address any of them suffi , iently. 

Hawke plays the starring role 
so lidly, only occasionally overdo-
ing his often over-the-top lines. 
Paltruw gives a stellar perfor-
mance as the beautiful but bitchy

woman taught to be callous and 
hurtful. 

The two actors definitely play 
off each other, at times creating 
very believable sexual tension. 

However, compared with some 
of his other recent movies such as 
"Heat," DeNiro is good. but not 
great. 

Cuaron and the cast do a great 
joh keeping a potentially dull lilm 
entertaining, with the help or' 
majestic sets and, an above-par 
soundtrack. featuring songs from 
Chris Cornell, 199y Pop and The

So If "Titanic" is sold out again 
and "Half Baked" doesn't sound 
romantic enough, "Great Expecta-
tions" might be the flick to see on 
Valentine's D~y.

Some people say that Cupid is

have seri ous issues. The whole 
idea is bi zarre, frightening and 
indirectly support s the use of 
date-rape drugs.

The food at Cafe Sevi lla is, at

The primary draw lO Cafe

A ro mantic se tting, the restauran t 
itself is small and intimate, while

The History of Valentine's Day 
Let us now reflect on the true meaning of this holiday 

Starting off with a .short historical conte-xt of how \?alentine's 
cfJay came to be, we must jump into our time machines and head 
back to the third century. 'This was the ruUng era of the ({{oman 
emperor Claudius ILfit this time, Claudius was in the midst of 
gathering a large army and he forbade men to marry during 
enlistment or acti~ duty.JIe felt that single men would make bet-
ter fighters when'not worrying about a family back home. 

Counteractil'e to Claudius' wishes, a Christian priest named 
\?alentine secretly wedded people forbidden, to marry by ({{ornan 
law. \?alentine was arrested and beheaded on .11'ebruary 14th, 269 

fiC{)o 8ince then, he has been the patron saint of lO I'ers - and the 
14th of ji'ebruary was mernorialized to honor him - initially, at 
least. 

(Presently, \?a/rntinr's c{)ay if:> marked by g[/i rxchange arnong

Bitter Taste In Seniors' Mouths 
FOURSOME: Kudi rka, Beemer, Bollenbach and Borah say a sad goodbye 
By Jonah Nisenson 
Co-Associate Spor ts Editor 

For the UCSD men's water polo 
eniors , the disappointing fini sh to 

this year's season left a bitter taste 
in their respective mouths. 

In the Western Waler Polo Asso-
CiatIO n Championship game 
against UC Davis, one goal kept 
the Tritons from a berth in the 
NCAA Championships in Fort 
Lauderdale. Fla. As ill fate would 
have it , UCSD led for most of the 
way, bUl Davis had the lean at the 
finish that gave it an 11-7 victory 
and a trip to Florida. 

That UCSD even made it lO the 
WWPA Championship game was 
due in no small part to seniors 
Romas Kudirka, Pat Beemer, Adam 
Bollenbach and John Borah . 

Leading the Tritons in scoring 
with 49 goals and a .480 shooting 
percentage was Kudirka, the big 
man on the in ide who lilled the 

PRINCE: 
UCSD is currently 
No. 9 in Division III

University. They arc luoking for-
ward to a rematch scheduled for 
Mar. 12. 

The injury to Shabel put Liu at 
the numb.::r two singl.::s slot for 
Tuesday's match, and he went Oil lO 
win 6-2. 6-4. Liu. along with hi s 
partner Albrecht. also won at nUIll -
ber two doubl 'S , toI -2. 

When asked abou t his outlook 
for the s.::ason, Turn.:: r said. "1 am 
opt imisti c that if everyone 'gets 
hea lthy we can make it 10 rcgion-
als . From there it wi ll basicall y be a 
fr.::c- for -a II:' 

UCSD is cu rr.:: nt ly ranked No. \) 
in Divbion III and third in the West 
Region behind UC Santa Cruz and

crucial hole set posi ti on with hi s 
commanding presence. One of the 
all-time greats in UCSD's ,colorful 
water polo hi story, Kudirka was 
named NCAA Division III Player 
of the Year in December by the 
United SLates Water Polo Coaches 
Association and the WWPA Player 
of the Year for the second straig ht 
season in November. 

"Romas' presence next year will 
be sorely mi ssed," sophomore Ross 
Mecham said. "He's a huge guy 
who is up there with the guys who 
play hole set at Division I schools. 
He came through a bunch of times 
in the clutch this season." 

A greaL defensive player and a 
team captain this season, Bollen-
bach's veteran leadership will deli-
nitely be missed. His 23 goals, 15 
assists and 30 steals earned him a 
spot on the Division IIJ Water Polo 
All-Ameri can First Team alongside 
Kudirka. 

"Adam is prell y fast and helped 
a lot on the offensive end shooting 
and running the offen e," Mecham 
said. "Losing him wi ll hUrl because 
of his game sense, speed and 
skills." 

Beemer. a transfer student in hi s 
second season in the UCSD water 
polo program, tended goal for the 
Tritons thi s year wiLh I:apable 
hands. 

"Beemer was huge," Mecham 
said. " He was our goalie. I felt con-
fident with that he could stop any-
thing. He always had hi s head in 
the game." 

Borah, contributing ofT Lhe 
bench, showed reliable skills in 
game situations. He was an essen-
ti al role player throughout his 
career. His dedication to the team is 
a rarity and will be sorely missed. 

It is safe to say that the Tritons 
of next season will have some 
rather large speedos to till. 

Pat Bee •• r: Goalie Pat 
Beemer, a transfer student in 
his second season with the 
Tritons , manned the cage with 
his lightning-quick hands.

second consecutive year.

Adam BoII.nbach: Scored

22 SPORTS The UCSD Guardian 

UCSD .Sports Clubs 
RUGBY 
Sometime!., these thing, hap-

pen. It is a common ailment in 
sports: the letdown. 

Often, after a team scores a big 
wi n over a great team, it can very 
easily take the nex t team on the 
schedule - a much lesser team -
for granted and get beat. The teams 
that can sti ll li nd a way to wi n on 
the slower days have true champi-
onship caliber. 

Ask the North Caro l ina Tar 
Heels basketball tea m, who beat 
the No. I team in the country, 
Duke, and then nearly lost to 
unranked Georgia Tech. 

Take the UCSD rughy squad 's 
game last Saturday against Cali for-
nia Insti tute of Technology, for 
example. 

Previously, the ruggers grabbed 
a huge win over Stanford, one of 
the top teams in the country. Ca l 
Tech was not supposed 10 offer the 
same kind of challenge, but i t was a 
team full of cra fty veterans and 
almost caught UCSD sleeping. 

However, the men in blue and gold 
were able to hold off Cal Tech, 17-
O. 

" They ca me out hard early," 
Cuach Eri c Takeuchi said. " [They I 
were very disruptive to our game. 
They did some things Ithat] dIs-
tracted us and lOok us out of our 
palLern for the majori ty of the 
game." 

Courtney Geigle opened the 
scoring for UCSD after the first 37 
minutes of the match went score-
less. A t the hal f, the score was only 
5-0. 

In the second hal f, the old-
timers from Cal Tech cont inued to 
wreak havoc on UCSD's game plan 
and thO;! ruggers were forced ,to sur-
vi ve on their youth and ta lent. 

UCSD fina lly got th rough again 
on Chay "Gangsta" Chang's try. 
Andy " Wilma" Wi lga scored the 
conversion to put UCSD up, 12-0. 
Darren " Wol fman" Garb added 
another try for UCSD, which wi ll 
l ine up nex t against Occidental 
College this Saturday.

" ' t was a bil co ld, but it was a

The other top fini sh fur the men 
came in the Men's C criterium as 
Tom "T he Man with the Ladies"

PRINCE: 
UCSD only lost 
number six singles 
Continued frOlll ..... 24 
we played how we should have 
pl ayed," senior Anthony 
M elicharek said. "We were all pret-
ty pumped for our first home 
match." 

Melicharek played at number 
three singles and also won handily, 
6-2,6- 1. 

The Tritons only loss came at 
number six singles as Vincent Dar-
mohusado was narrowly defeated. 
Turner, however, remained confi -
dent. 

" He was obviously nervous," 
Turner said. '" know that he will 
play much bener than thaI in the 
future." 

The Trilons' season was sup-
posed to get underway on Saturday, 
l an. 31 with a match against CSU 
L os Angeles, but the wrath of EI 
Nino ended any thought of the 
match, That turned Tuesday's 
match into UCSD's opener. The 
CSULA match will be rescheduled 
for a later date. 

Despite the task at hand, many 
thoughts seemed to be on the 
future. as well as on the past. 

"My number one goal for thi s 
year is 10 beat Redlands," Ken Liu 
said. 

For the past two years, the Tri-
tons have been defeated 4-3 in the 
regional semifinal s by Redlands 

See PRINCE, Page 19 

SPICE: 
Santa Barbara hosts

Continued frOlll page 24 
base. 

The good people of the UCSD 
fencing squad do not necessarily 
subsc ri be to such lactics, but they 
have been given swords, and they 
have been using them quite wcll 
lately. 

Last weekend the Tritons trav-
elled to the rain-soaked shores of 
Santa Barbara for a huge four-team 
fencing tournament. Joining the 
Tritons and the UC Santa Barbara 
Gauchos were the Bru ins of UCLA 
and the Troj ans of USc. All four 
squads were gunning for a vi ctory 
and a decisive edge in conference 
pl ay. 

The weekend turned out to be a 
lough one for Janet Wertz, Juli a 
Kulla-Mader and the rest of the 
women's squad. But the men 
tumed,in a resounding sweep of all 
three schools. 

Despi te the absence of team 
captain and epee spec ialist David 
D eeths, Ihe Tri tons nevertheless 
persevered and stepped up their 
game. 

Peter Graham led the sabre 
events with an 8-1 weekend record , 
a 10lal shared by Tim M arsh in epee 
and San Diego State transfer Ted 
Padgell in the foil. 

Padgett 's arrival in La 10lla has 
been huge for UCSD. He is by far 
the best in the conference in fo i I, 
and proved it lasl weekend as he 
d ispatched many players who were 
considered to be his toughest com-
petition, including a member of the 
Kuwaili Nalionalleam. 

"He's really helping foil a lot," 
Deeths said. " His only loss (last 
weekend) was a nuke. He can beal 
everyone in conference." 

The Tri tons are looking forward 
to making a run at Ihe conference 
litle, and the NCAA Regionals.

It is hard to believe, but our 
good friend, Bilt Ctinton, has 
done ~ again! You'd think af-
ter a nasty month of public re-
lalions gaffes and loo-foos, 
that our always high prolite 
President would be interested 

in laying low to let the unaromatic 
air waft over his well-coilled silhouette. 

But no, no, nO .. ,nol our Billy Boy ... his motiva-
tion to tum the dagger in our back one more revo-
lution is unretenting. And lor the current popu-
tace 01 UCSD 1M Soccer ptayers that tast twist is 
more agony than pain. Let's face it, these play-
ers are dying to play their sport, and the Presi-
dent has decided to once again give us a day 
ol ... a damn holiday to be specilic .. . and you'd think 
that most of us would be appreciative of that ges-
ture. 

But nO ... not this group. 1M Soccer bulls have 
been steadily put on hold lor an endtess list of 

na~ona t events .... the Super Bowt, Et Nino, and 
now, the President's Holiday weekend. 

When does ~ end! 
t mean, Bill, just because it's a tradition to 

honor our past president's birthdays with a na-
tional holiday, doesn't mean that YOU HAVE TO 
DO IT! Alter all, you are the President, Won't 
you be busy laking Monica out for Valentine's Day 
this weekend anyways? Why do something nice 
for us. 

We'd rather work to keep our country moving 
forward, and for heaven's sake, we'd much rather 
be ptaying Intramurat Soccer this weekend. And 
besides, by keeping the hotiday tradilion alive, do

you reatly think a hundred years from now that your 
birthday is ever going to be induded w~h the Wash-
ington and Lincolns of the world. Nyet! .

down to the business 01 updating all 1M Soccer play-

You see that's the way ~ is when May Trieu decides to play Volley-

or someone even more venerable ... uuh .... Ahmad Russ lor instance. It just didn't maner. 

When May plays, May wins. Its been that way for seemingly decades. 
The only new equation to this year's tournament was who was going to take the big hit in the finals. The 

magic couple this time around was Chuck Tuey and Kelly Ung who actually played stellar volleyball alilhe 
way through to push Trieu-Vuong to the Hmit. 

The final score 0110-15, 15-10, 11-9 gave hope to all volleyball players on campus that pemaps Granny

Coach 
Travis Hili 

First Match of the Year Brings 
UCSD a 6-1 Victory vs. Chapman 

Sexist Nagano Is 
Killing the Coach 

I don' t know what it is, supa-
pimps and supa-chicks, but I 
just can' t get into these Winter 
Olympics. First of all , they 're in 
Nagano, Japan. Don' t get me 
wrong, I have nothing against 
Japan - from what I' ve seen, 
it 's an amazi ng coun try. 

But as our up-and-collling 
wri ter Jacob Gordon poi nted 
out, if I hear the word Nagano 
agai n, J'm go ing to explode. 
Everythi ng is Nagano th is and 

agano that. I'm gett ing ready 
to Nagano those damn CBS 
commentators in the head. 

I mean, let's face it: four 
years ago, we had Tanya Hard-
ing vs. Nancy Kerrigan . Aft er 
Jeff Gi lIooly Nugano-ed Na ncy 's 
knee, the brawl was on and the 
whole nation wan ted to see who 
would win the ultimate cat light. 

That was the sa le reason 
everyone wa tched the 
Olym pi cs. Basicall y, CBS's 
teasers duped people in to 
w1I /(;hing women 's curling fo r 11 
couple hours because there 
would be a ~arding interview at 
halftime. People were so inter-
ested in thi s fi ght that they were 
down to watch some two-man 
bobsled if skating was on nex t. 

Hell , people were so interest-
ed in that thing that people 
bought black-market videos of 
Harding' sexual exploits by the 
truckload. And, well , how can I 
put thi s tactfully... she got 
Nagano-ed by the ugly stick. 

Now if the video had been of 
fellow icc skater Katarina Witt, 
that would have been a different 
story ... 

It 's not. like I haven't tried to 
watch the games, I rea lly have. I 
turned them on just last week-
end. f thought I was in luck 
when I saw that a women '5 
hockey game was on. I had seen 
some promos for women's 
hockey somewhere before, and I 
remembered that these women 
viciously checked each other. 

So, the United States was 
whipping China and I was hop-
ing to see a few nice checks and 
if the gods were smiling on me, 
maybe even a fi ght. 

Well , as many of you know, 
the gods don' t smile on the 
Coach often and two women 
accidentally collided and one 
was given a two-minute penalty. 

Then the ann uncer started 
blabbing about how h thinks 
it 's good that no checking is 
allowed in these games. No 
checking? Call me craty, but 
that sounds sexist. 

What these game need is 
another cool scandal. Or better 
yet, there should be an event in 
which an NHL player has to 
catch an ice skater, and if he 
does, he gets to beat the Nagano 
oul of them. 

NICE START: Tritons made minced meat of Panthers with wins in five of their six singles matches 

Clai re Schneider/Guardian 
Take That: Emil Mihet, stepping in for the injured Steve Shab~1 at number one singles, won in 
straight sets, while he and Shabel won the number one doubles slot easily with an 8-1 victory. 

Tritons Skid Out in the Rain 
DOWNPOUR: California Baptist College hit 7 home runs as UCSD fell 
in Riverside, 21-8, despite committing only three errors on a wet field 
By John Maynard 
Staff Writer 

Disaster strikes again . No, not 
that EI Nino crap; Triton baseball , 
you fools. 

In between the torrential down-
pours on Monday, UCSD 
squeezed in nine innings 
in Ri verside, as it battled 
Californi a Baptist Col-
lege. 

The Tritons were hop-
ing 10 avoid the shell ack-
ing they received the last 
time they visited Cal 
Baptist when UCSD 
flopped, 20-0. Unfortunately, on 
Monday disaster truck again as 
the Tritons were shelled, 21-8. 

UCSD got off to a decent start 
in the top of the first inn ing, as it 
got n the board with I run, but 
from then on it was downhill. 

al Baptist stepped up to the 
plate facing a U SO squad that 
hadn ' t held practice on its home 
fi eld for over two weeks due to 
flooding. 

The lack of fi eld practi ce 
proved to be di sastrous for the Tri -
tons, as the pitching staff led by 
junior Dav id Takehara, was 
shelled for 5 runs in the first two 
innings. 

Despite an 8-2 defi cit 
at the end of the fourth 
inning, the Tritons 
attempted to come back. 

Junior Kenny Fluhart y 
stepped up to the plate 
with one man on base and 
banged hi s second home 
run of the season. UCSD 
scored once more in the 

inning, keeping the game slill 
within reach, dcwn only 8-5. 

Unfortunately, the game didn ' t 
stay within reach for long as the 

al Baptist bals started swinging 
big. 

In Ihe bOllom of the fifth , Cal 
Baptist got the majority of its 18 
hits, knocking in an embarrassing 
9 runs. 

''They were just nat out hit-
ting," junior fir t baseman Eric 

Pangelinan said. "There was noth-
ing we could do." 

The downpour that began in 
the fifth inning continued into the 
seventh inning as Cal Bapti st 
added another 3 runs for a game 
total of 21. 

Despite letting 21 runs cross 
home plate, the Triton defense 
played well , committing only 
three errors during the scoring 
frenzy. On the other hand, Triton 
pitching struggled, giving up 7 
home runs. 

"There's ju t something about 
that place," Paneglinan said. "Bad 
vibes or something." 

The Tritons are hungry for 
revenge. They take will again take 
on Cal Baptist at home in April. 
Last year the Tritons redeemed 
their atrocious loss and expect to 
do the same this year. 

That rematch, however, is a 
long way off. In the meantime, the 
Tritons are focusing on their 
Valentine's Day matchup against 
the Chapman University Panthers.

Domination is the only way to 
descri he the UCSD men 's tennis 
performance last Tue~day on 

TENNIS 

UCS D's north 
court s. 

Despite a star-
t ling number of 
injuries, the 
match was never 
in doubt as the 
Tritons took care 
of Chapman Uni -
versity, 6- 1, in the 

first match of the year. 
The match began with UCSD 

taking the lone doubles point by 
sweeping the three doubles match-
es. Included in these three was an 
8- 1 pounding at the number one 
slot by Steve Shabel and Emil 
Mihet. Unfort unately, Shabel 
pu lled a stomach muscle in thi s sel 
and wou ld be unable to play hi s 
singles match. 

Arter the doubles round, Head 
Coach Brian Turner warned his 
players to avoid sloppy play and to 
keep focused. The Tritons did just 
that and responded by wi nn ing five 
of the six singles matches. 

Emil Mihet, stepping in at num-
ber one singles for the injured Sha-
bel, won in impressive fashion, 6-2, 
6-4. Dan Albrecht gave the Tritons 
a 6-2, 6-2 win at the number four 
singles spot while Kai Miller ea ily 
defeated his opponent 6-0, 6-0 at 
number fi ve.
