STUDENT 
PROGRESS 

OVER 
. PRIVACY? 
College groups and 
Bush's education 
leader butt heads on 
possible student 
tracking system. 

By Serena Renner 
ASSOCIATE NEWS EOITOR 

In response to national concerns 
regarding the future of higher educa-
tion, Secretary of Education Margaret 
Spellings last week called for imme-
diate attention to issues of access, 
affordability and - the thorniest 
topic - accountability of U.S. uni-
versities, including' introducing an 
idea to implement a student-track-
ing database, which has raised pri-
vacy concerns among college groups 
nationwide. 

Spellings' newest action plan 
addresses the worries of the 19-mem-
ber' Commission OIl the Future of 
Higher Education that she created last 
year to launch a national dialogue on 
the need to strengthen higher educa-
tion to maintain global competitive-
ness. Among many findings, the report 
stated that the U.S. college attainment 
rate has fallen to ninth among major 
industrialized countries, according 
to the Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development, with 
only one-third of Americans earning 
college degrees. 

In order to combat the decline, 
the commission has urged a dramatic 
overhaul of the current system, which 
has become "increasingly risk-ave.rse, 
at times self-satisfied and unduly 
expensive," the report stated. 

"This is the beginning of a process 
of long-overdue reform," Spellings 
said in her speech last week "Over 
the years, we've invested tens of bil-
lions of dollars in taxpayer money [in 
higher education] and just hoped for 
the best. We deserve better than that." 

While the September report has 
spurred discussion as planned, it has 
also sparked a heated debate over 
the most controversial section, which 
authorizes the implementation of a 
national student-tracking database 
that Spellings has soundly endorsed. 

Known as a "unit recorder," this 
device would track individual student 
progress over time in order to better 
assess and compare the quality of 
institutions while also holding univer-
sities accountable for student success. 

It could include information 
such as a student's major, financial 
aid information, admissions data and 
college completion rate. Because cur-
rent data systems are so restricted, it's 
hard for parents, students and poli-

A.S. Pres 
Pans RSO 

Report 
By Matt L'Heureux 

ASSOCIATE NEWS EOITOR 

In an ongoing attempt to rede-
fine the role of Residential Security 
Officers on campus, a group of stu-
dent leaders has released an e-mail 
response critiquing a contentious 
work group report that recommended 
no change in the RSO program's offi-
cial description. 

A.S. President Harry Khanna, 
along with representatives from the 
Graduate Student Association and the 
Undergraduate Student Experience 
and Satisfaction steering committee, 
criticized the original report for its 
lack of student representation in the 
work group and a general 'misunder-
standing of the student complaints 
about officers as outlined in the 
U.S.E.S. report. 

The original RSO work group, cre-
ated by Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Joseph W. Watson, consisted 
of five university staff members but 
had no student representation. 

Chancellor Marye Anne Fox, who 
visited the A-S. Council on Sept. 27, 
had no direct explanation for how the 
oversight occurred. 

"I can't tell you how this happened, 
but I suspect that whatever happened 
during the summer - we obviously 
failed to provide the kind of repre-
sentation that you need," Fox said. "I 
do think it's important for students to 
have a voice. I suspect that at the end 
of summer, many people just want to 
get their desks cleaned off, and I think 
that is what may have happened [with

Department Tongue-Tied Over 
Chinese Pro ram's Troubles 

JASON CAMPA/GUARDIAN 
The Chinese department has added up to 20 extra students in classrooms in an effort to alleviate staffing problems. 

Program lacks funds 
and faces staffmg 
crisis, forcing class 
cancellations and 
overcrowding. 

By Jessie Chait 
CONTRIBUTING WRITER 

UCSD's prestigious Chinese 
studies program, which pioneered 
the multi-tracking language place-
ment system, is facing challenges 
this quarter due to deficient funding, 
staffing problems and exponential 
enrollment growth, forcing the pro-

gram to cancel some classes and 
overfill others. 

The department has cut two 
language classes completely due to 
inadequate staffing levels. Professor 
Qin-Hong Anderson took mater-
nity leave this quarter and another 
department faculty member, profes-
sor Pei-Chia Cheng, is scheduled to 
tak.! maternity leave next quarter. 
The lack of critical teaching staff 
has left scheduled classes without 
professors to teach them. 

In addition to federally mandat-
ed maternity leave, professors are 
entitled to receive paid leave, and 
department funds for such purposes 
are not fully reimbursed, according 

to Dean of Arts and Humanities 
Michael Bernstein. The policy has 
further pressured the department's 
funds and resources. 

The department is trying to find 
substitutes, Bem~tein said, but so 
far has been unable to attract any 
because they would not receive ben-
efits. 

This year, UCSD's record-size 
freshman class was unable to regis-
ter until shortly before classes began. 
Within that time frame, the influx 
of students registering for a Chinese 
studies program course critically 
exceeded expectations, according to

Critics contend 
UCSD's plan to move 
care from Hillcrest 
will severely burden 
local poor areas. 

By Charles Nguyen 
SENIOR STAFF WRITER 

Local hospitals and groups 
are protesting plans to shrink 
services at Hillcrest Medical 
Center while expanding those 
at La Jolla's Thornton Hospital, 
follOWing the release of a 
countywide study that said the 
shift would not Significantly 
impact San Diego healthcare. 

The plan to move aU Hillcrest 
inpatient beds and its trauma cen-
ter, scheduled to take place grad-
ually over 25 years, to Thornton 
Hospital will not impact county 
hospitals as a whole, according 

Bullied Again 

to the study conducted by con-
sulting firm the Abaris Group. 
However, critics of the plan say 
the relocation of 385 beds will 
put severe pressure on hospitals 
operating in the "safety net" area, 
which sen::es most of San Diego's 
poor and uninsured. 

"We fully expect that once 
the UCSD Hillcrest Medical 
Center is gone as a full -service 
hospital, other hospitals in the 
area will see a gigantic influx in 
patients:' said Don Stanziano, 
a spokesman for Hillcrest's 
Scripps Mercy Hospital. "We 
don't have the capacity to be 
the only hospital in the area. 
To us, it's a hostile closure." 

Serving uninsured patients, 
Stanziano said, has already 
presented revenue problems. 
The SCTipps Mercy Hospital 
in Chula Vista lost S10 million 
last year and $14 million the 
year before because the major-

INSIDE 

ity of its patients are un - or 
underinsured. 

The county-commissioned 
report found that over 57 per-
cent of the 9,330 patients in 
Central and South San Diego 
are underinsured. 

The report also found that 
hospitals across the county 
will be able to handle UCSD's 
displacement of care, which 
includes the addition of 
almost 400 beds to Thornton 
Hospital. 

"While there may be some 
patients/family member[sl and 
hospitals impacted, overall the 
impact is not expected to be 
ignificant:' the report stated. 

However, the report found 
that the move would cre-
ate "some acce s issues" and 
"inconvenience" for patients 
in poorer areas. Opponents

Last week, A.S. President Harry 

Khanna and Alumni Association 
President Mark Diamond 
announced a student-a lumni be t 
on the Cha ncellor's 5K, which 
wi ll be held Oct. 20, 

The two presidents began a 
debate over who is faste r - stu-
dents or alumni. 

Diamond, 43, proposed a bet 
that his nine-minute mile pace 
will easi ly beat Khanna . If so, 
Kha nna will owe Diamond a full-
course mea l, including one carne 
asada burrito and rolled tacos 
with guacamole and hot sauce. 

However, if Khanna wins, 
Diamond will dona te $300 to 
the UCSD Alumni Lea dership 
Scholarship, he said . 

"We have a genera l concern 
that current students are slow," 
Diamond sa id. "Not intellectu-
a Ily, but in terms of velocity, from 
point A to B. We feel that this is 
a problem." 

UC Police Awarded for 
Taming With Taser 

Two UCS D police office rs , 
Tina Greer and Manue l Garcia, 
were among 23 officials to 
rece ive the Blue Knight Award 
on Sept. 29 from the San Diego 
Crime Commission fo r their hero-
ic actions last July. 

The incident involved two 
people illegally ca mping in 
a va n in the Scripps Institute 

of Oceanography. When Greer 
arrived on the scene, she dis-
covered a large-blade knife in 
a compartment near the roof of 
the van. 

The male occupant waved the 
knife toward the officers and did 
not stop until Greer managed to 
strike the man with her electronic 
Taser. 

After the officers got the situation 
under control, the male dropped 
his knife and fe ll to the ground, the 
UCSD Police Department stated in 
a press release. 

Fluorescent Eyes, 
Evolutionary Ties 

UCSD biologists have discov--
ered a key protein in the eyes 
of fruit flies, demonstrati ng an 
evolutionary change that has 
improved visual acuity and angu-
lar sensitivity in each of the flies' 
BOO-unit eyes. 

The compound, which glows 
as a fluorescent protein in each 
eye, allows for the formation of 
I ight-gatheri ng units in open-eye 
systems. 

Researc hers have discovered 
that the loss of this protein can 
convert open-system eyes into 
closed ones. 

"These results help illustrate 
the beauty and power of evolution 
and show how ' little steps' - like 
the presence of a si ngle structural 
protein - can so spectacu la rly 
account for major c hanges in 
form and function." biology pro-
fesor and research team leader 
Charles Zuker said.

Council Gets First Crack at 
New Constitution Debate 

Institute Ranks UCSD as Biotech Leader 

T he A.S. Council started its meeting with a serious moment of silence for all of the students 
who died in school shootings this past 
week, and ended with a resolution on 
how to properly eat a cheeseburger. 

After the solemn moment, put for-
ward by Eleanor Roosevelt College 
Senior Senator Erik Rodrlguez-
Palacios, interim Vice President 
External Long Pham presented the 

that came up last year when many 
of the apartments near campus were 
converted into condos. 

Rodriguez-Palacios introduced a 
proposal allowing the A.S. president to 
vote during council meetings but abol-
ishing the president's right to veto. 

"There is no need for a separation 
of powers in student government:' he 
said. 

A change in job descriptions for 
other council-council's goal to 

register 2,000 
students to vote 
in the upcoming 
November elec-
tions. Pharn said 
that they have 
approximately 
300 new voters 

New 
Business 

members included 
the speaker of the 
council, currently 
the vice president 
internal, suggest-
ing it should be 
changed to a mem-· 
ber selected by the 

so far. A.S. President Harry Khanna 
conducted a special presentation, the 
first of six or seven future reports, 
to present his plan to make signifi-
cant changes to the council's governing 
documents. Khanna said that there are 
currently too many documents, bylaws 
and charters, which ultimately pro-
duce contradictions and redundancies. 
According to Khanna, the constitution 
was written 30 years ago by a commit-
tee appointed by the university admin-
istration and it did not represent the 
student body's best interests. 

The task force commissioned to 
rewrite the constitution generated 
the most debate with its proposal to 
create new academic-division sena-
tors instead of college divisions, which 
would hopefully increase voter turn-
out, Khanna said. 

"I think to say that we have six great 
colleges and one great A.S. would be 
to ignore that there is more to UCSD:' 
Khanna said. 

The creation of an associate vice 
president for local affairs was suggest-
ed to improve the relationship between 
UCSD and La Jolla residents, an issue 

er 

council. The task force on revamping 
the constitution said two weeks would 
be allowed for comments before a revi-
sion would be presented. 

The meeting shifted to reports 
by other council members, the fi rst 
coming from Commissioner of 
Communications Leo Bondar. 

"I got the broken fan in the media 
lab fLXed~ he said flatly. 

Finally, the council spent 20 min-
utes debating whether to purchase a 
cart to transport goody bags and other 
items the council might carry. Vice 
President Finance Conrad Ohashi 
commented that he strongly recom-
mended doors on the cart, but was 
overruled by the fmance committee. 

"The reason Conrad wanted doors 
was completely inappropriate~ John 
Muir College Junior Senator Aida 
Kuzucan said. "If something happens, 
I want there to be privacy:' 

While the council dissolved into 
laughter, Vice President Internal Pro 
Tempore Karl Gobel, filling in for Vice 
President Internal Janine Ddlomes, 
intervened just in time to rule the 
debate out of order. 

Campus places near 
top in patent 
development, 
research categories 
of recent report. 

By Mal/hew McArdle 
N EWS EDITOR 

UCSD, located in one of the 
most dense biotechnology sectors 
in the United States, was named 
in a recent study as one of the 
top universities in the world for 
its ability to develop and translate 
biotechnology into medical treat-
ments, drugs and other commercial 
applications. 

The study was released last month 
by the Milken Institute, an indepen-
dent economic think tank that uses 
research to identify and implement 
innovative ideas for "creating broad-
based prosperity~ according to the 
institute's Web site. 

In the study, the institute exam-
ined and ranked universities world-
wide based on their abilities to 
transfer biotechnology by way of 
the three critical stages of biotech 
development: published research, 
number of patents issued and com-
mercial outcomes. 

American universities domi-
nated the ran kings, and UCSD 
ranked sixth and eighth in the 
categories of publication and pat -
ent advancement, respectively. The 
UC system ranked second overall. 
behind the Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology, in the area of tech-
nology transfer commercialization, 
which includes biotechnology spin-
off company startups. 

"We are very pleased to be

and healthcare benefits to the San

UCSD was also recognized for 
its "exemplary performance" in the 
field of cell and developmental biol-
ogy, where its citation rate was 67 
percent more than the sample's uni -
versity average.

Property Services Alan S. Paau 
attributed UCSD's success to three 
policies: serving as a "resource cen-
ter" for activities related to intellec-
tual property, organizing intellectual 
properties to promote issues related 
to entrepreneurism and organizing 
global outreach activities that pro-
mote campus technology. 

The TTIPS office began in 
November 1994 with a staff of two 
people, but has since grown to 30. 
Paau stated in an e-mail. In addition, 
UCSD has increased its technol-
ogy transfer-related gross income 
immensely since the office's incep-
tion, from $2,96 million in 1995 to 
$22.1 million in 2006. The campus 
has earned a total of$126.09 million 
in its 12-year history. 

"Technologies licensed in the 

earlier years are finally reaching the 
market and are generating royaltie 
on products sold:' Paau stated in an 
e-mail. 

Licensed UCSD patents have 
resulted in more than 230 commer-
cial products offered by nearly 50 
companies, according to Paau. 

Among the many examples of 
UCSD's biotechnology products are 
Erbitux, used for the treatment of 
colorectal, head and neck cancers, 
and Elmiron, which is used for 
the treatment of interstitial cy -
tit is. In addition, UCSD has also 
produced metabolites from marine 
microbes fo r use in anti-wrinkle 
cosmetics and green fluorescent 
protein derivatives used in biologi-
cal research. 

According to a UC Office of 
the President press release, UCSD 
has secured approximately 560 U.S. 
patents, placing second nationally 
behind UC San Francisco, and has 
granted 494 licenses for commer-
cial development and founded more 
than 100 startups based on licensed 
UCSD technologies. Moreover, 
UCOP estimates that 220 companies 
have spun off from UCSD faculty, 
staff and alumni. 

UCSD plans to further its prom-
inence in the field of biotechnology 
transfer by forming more partner-
ships with industry leaders. 

"[UCSDj is good at doing 
research." Paau stated in an e-mail. 
"We do not have much capabil-
ity (and shouldn't) in product 
development. Therefore, building 
partnerships wi th industry and 
entrepreneurs will cont inue to be 
our plan to further our ability to 
turn innovations into beneficial 
products [that] serve society and 
promote regional economic devel-
opment:'

A DROP FROM THE INKWELL By Jennifer Hsu 

( 

Congress Finally Catches Up With th~ Rest of the Class: Textbook Prices Are Ballooning 

One Old-Timer's Electrifying 
Brush With Our Fulure 

P roeter and Gamble, the same company that brought shaving into the jet age with the world's 
first triple-blade safety razor, has 
just revolutionized the toothbrush 
industry. In a fit of inspiration, the 
mavericks at the Lockheed-Manin 
of toiletries have developed the Oral-
B "Triumph" ProfessionaiCare 9400 
power toothbrush, the world's first 

to brush too hard - and that's where 
the ProfessionalCare 9400's micro-
chip shines. The brush head bas 
special pressure sensors that mea· 
sure how much force you're putting 
on your teeth. If you're pushing too 
hard, the toothbrush will automati-
cally adjust its motion to compensate. 
Now thals progress. 

For some reason, this den-
toothbrush with 
an onboard com-
puter. 

You heard 
right: a toothbrush 
with an onboard 
computer. 

I was confused 
at fICst, too. My 

~ChiCken ~ Scratch ~ Nathan Miklos • nm iklos@ucsd.edu 
tal wunderkind 
(look it vp; in the 
future, you'll need 
to know what it 
means) reminded 
me of a trip to 
Disneyland I took 
a few years back. 
I hadn't been to 

immediate reaction, I'm ashamed 
to admit, was to burst out laugh-
ing. I should be more appreciative 
~ of innovation, I know. It's just that 

even with 20 years of tooth-brushing 
experience, I didn't have the slight-
est idea how a computerized tooth-
brush would even begin to work. 
Fortunately, the Oral-B Web site set 
me straight. . 

First, I learned that I was using 
all the wrong lingo. In my day - say, 
two years ago - we talked about 
"brushing" and, if you were espe-
cially progressive, "flOSSing." But that 
way of thinking went out with side-
ponytails and ·Saved by the BelL" 
In the future, we will talk about the 
·oral hygiene experience" and "clini-
cally superior cleaning." We may 
also become more German and stan 
linking words togethe~ like so many 
sausages, as in Oral-B's trademarked 
"ProfessionalCare," "FlossAction," 
"Power Polisher" and "MicroPulse." 
Our toothbrushes will be the first to 
adapt, however: The ProfessionaiCare 
9400 displays information in 13 dif-
ferent languages. 

Second, I discovered that the den-
tal hygiene of the future is far more 
dangerous than I had ever imagined. 
Today, killing yourself with a man-
ual toothbrush takes considerable 
effort and more th~ a little creativ-
ity. But with the Oral-B 'Triumpb" 
ProfessionaiCare 9400, death by elec-
trocution is just a toilet bowl away. 
Accordingly, page six of the tooth-
brush's 35-page(!) instruction manual 
is dedicated to safety. We will live on 
a knife's edge. 

Third, I found , that brushing 
one'. teeth is not as simple as I once 
thought. For om, it's actually possible 

Disneyland in a long time, and a lot 
had changed. The lines were longer, 
the hot dogs were far more expen-
sive, and the helpful voice that told 
me to keep my hands inside the 
vehicle at all times also told me to 
mantengaser sentlldo, por f4vor. 

But Tomorrowland, which was · 
always my favorite IlIId as a spoiled 
kid, had changed the most. "Captain 
Eo" had disappeared at about the 
same time as Michael Jackson's mas-
culinity; the leisurely People Mover 
was now a rocket-powered bullet 
train; and the real rocket ride had 
shed its Saturn V skin in favor of 
something more colorful and insect-
like. 

And then there's the big revolving 
theater that everyone ignores. The 
theater used to have a singing anima-
tronic eagle that scared the hell out 
of me as a kid, but thiJ had changed, 
too. Instead of the demon-bird show, 
it was a big exposition showcasing 
the technology of tomorrow. Inside, a 
real-live man who moved and talked 
like a salesman told us about all the 
amazing things that the kitchen of 
the future would have. 

A mixer that precisely measures 
and mixes your cookie dough, ensur-
ing a homogenously perfect distribu -
tion of chocolate chips. An oven that 
senses when your casserole is done, 
and automatically shuts itself off. An 
Internet-savvy refrigerator that lets 
you choose from a alalog of recipies, 
and, after a brief consultation with 
your pantry, orden whatever ingre-
dients you're milling from the local 
grocery store. 

At fmt, I was overwhelmed with 
sentimentality. "But I lib mixing my 
own cookie dough," I complained. "I 

like going to the grocery store and 
talking to the produce lady:' 

But the salesman wasn't finished. 
We turned a corner, and he showed 
us a high-tech robotic dog being 
developed in Japan. It was superior 
to an actual dog in many ways, the 
salesman assured us. It was fully pro-
grammable, and could learn far more 
verbal commands than any real dog. 
It wouldn't need to be cleaned up 
after, it wouldn't dig holes in the 
neighbor's yard and it wouldn't chase 
cats unless you told it to. Best of all, it 
could be turned off when you didn't 
want it. 

And it would never die. 
Again, I was foolishly filled with 

mixed emotions. I couldn't argue that 
the robot wasn't technically superior 
to a real dog. It was a very convenient 
dog. But still I was uneasy. Maybe I 
like personality better than obedi-
ence. 

But the ProfessionalCare 9400 
power toothbrush has changed all 
that. Now, I'm so excited about tech-
nology that I've started designiqg 
the next-gen~tion electronic tooth-
brush. In addition to an onboard 
computer, it will have high-speed 
wiRless and a Web cam, so you can 
get real-time brushing advice from 
your dentist. It will download your 
dental records and modify the brush 
speed to penonally optimize your 
oral hygiene experience. 

Plus, it'U be laser-guided, with 
infrared plaque senson and fly-by-
wire pitch control. And maybe a 
band-wanner. 

To be sure, my toothbrush will 
have its detractors. All that fuddy-
duddy John Steinbeck wrote in 1952's 
East of Eden: 

"There are monstrous changes 
taking place in the world, forces 
shaping a future whose face we do 
not know. Some of these forces seem 
evil to us, perhaps not in themselves 
but because tbeir tendency is to 
eliminate other things that we hold 
good.-

But fortunately, that part is bur-
ied way in chapter 12, and it's not 
even addressed in the movie version, 
whereas you CIII load up the Oral-
B Web site right PlOW and see the 
technological wonder of tomorrow's 
tootbrush. Watch the video: 

"For consumers who want the 
very best for their teeth and gums, 
therr is 110 going IHIck." 

Amen, brother, amen.

Drug Prevention 

Programs Ineffective 
Dear Editor, 

In his Sept. 19 Guardian col-
umn, Nathan Miklos addresses fed -
eral anti -drug ads. Upon reading 
the :\rticle "Federal Anti-Drug Ads a 
$1.4 Billon Boondoggle:' it is easy to 
be concerned with the effectiveness 
of the federal anti-drug campaign. 
Many remember the "just say no" 
and D.A.R.E. programs, but most 
people never really saw them as 
ineffective. It makes sense from a 
financial standpoint in accordance 
with the actual reduction of drug 
use, but does that mean that these 
programs shouldn't have existed? 
No. But with the last two decades 
deemed a "$1.4 billion boondoggle:' 
it seems almost so. 

There is still most definitely a 
drug abuse problem in this coun -
try, and more specifically within 
younger age groups. Basically, that 
is where the importance of new 
approaches within these campaigns 
comes into play. Time has shown the 
direct "drugs are bad. don't do them" 
approach is more or less worthless 
and new, more creative methods 
must be used to call attention to 
the serious problem of drug abuse 
in our society. The need to reduce 
substance abuse and more specifi-
cally drug abuse within our society 
is an important social issue and 
social change is in order. To help 
aid this social change, there must be 
a media-wide anti-drug campaign. 
The federal government is just going 
to have to plan better, or at least 
create different campaigns and pro-
grams to help fight this issue. What 
doyou think? Howcan or should the 
federal government go about these 
anti-drug ads in the future? What 
should they avoid and what should 
they be sure to include? Regardless, 

these ads have been ineffective and 
costly on a financial standpoint. 
Let's just hope the next $1.4 billion 
is spent on campaigns and programs 
with more effective results.

Women's Colleges 
Serve Valuable Purpose 
Dear Editor, _ 

As the husband of a Randolph-
Macon Woman's College (R-MWC) 
alumna and a once-frequent visitor 
to women's colleges, I feel obliged 
to set the record straight and ques-
tion Ms. Naraghi's conclusions in 
"Castiog a Wider Net" (Oct. 2) that 
going coed is about simple econom-
ics and her implication that women 
at a single-sex school are disadvan-
taged in the real world. 

Women's schools are nei -
ther "finishing schools" nor elitist 
Stepford-Wife cloisters, Hollywood's 
stereotyped misconceptions a la 
"Mona Lisa Smile" notwithstand-
ing. Women-only classrooms are 
best suited to the unique learning 
styles of women - often incom-
patible with male-oriented teach-
ing - without the distractions of 
male dominance issues or sexual 
tension. Women who are educated 
without men in the classroom are 
arguably better prepared to compete 
in the real world than female coed 
graduates who have been socialized 
to accept inequality in male-domi-
nated classrooms run by majority-
male faculties (women's colleges are 
much more likely to have a near-
50-50 male-female faculty ratio) . A 
recent national survey of student 
engagement found that women who 
graduate from women's colleges are 
on average more successful, happier 
and more satisfied with their educa-
tion than their coed-graduate peers. 

The decision to go coed is not 

just about economics, and the eco-
nomics do not add up. R-MWC's 
endowment eclipses its peers. It has 
experienced steadily growing enroll-
ment (only in the late 1960s did 
it see higher enrollment numbers) . 
Its main attraction to prospective 
students is its academic excellence, 
and while few enroll just because of 
its single-sex nature, nearly all who 
graduate credit the all -women status 
for the college's academic strengths. 

Unfortunately, the R-MWC trust-
ees have for years ignored criticisms 
of the college's poor admissions out-
reach efforts and the root causes 
of its poor retention (such as dra-
conian "big sister" social policies , 
poor administration engagement 
with students, slashed budgets for 

. on-campus social events and cuts to 
popular academic programs). The 
trustees' decision was based upon 
a questionable "study" they com-
missioned, whose pro-coed conclu-
sion erroneously assumed contin-
ued economic support by alumnae, 
continued low interest in Single-sex 
colleges, unabated competition by 
other women's colleges and static 
admissions and retention problems, 
and postulated that the academic 
excellence which has served as the 
school's main selling point would 
be unaffected by a coed student 
body (whicb is directly at odds 
with all available evidence). The R-
MWC controversy continues to date 
(despite little ongoing press cover-
age) with student blockades, pro -
tests, alumnae revolts and threat-
ened litigation. 

That the New York Times saw fit 
to treat the subject with inexcusable 
superficiality in its article cited in 
"Casting a Wider Net" demonstrates 
amply that "All the news that's fit to 
print" is rarely fitted to print. 

Mo t of today's remaining wom-
en's colleges would agree that "cast-
ing a wider net" to include men r-______________________________________________________________ ~l ,~

Congressional Bill an 
Insult to Bill of Rights 

Dear Editor, 
The latest bill from our Republican-

led Congress is no less than a crimi-
na� act which every moral American 
must recognize. But don't just shake 
your heads. Act oow! It's every citizen's 
responsibility in any democratic sys-
tem of governance. Protect and fight 
for it, or lose it. Inform yourselves of 
the lies, deceit, dishonesty and betrayal 
of the American citizen which the Bush 
administration, and now Congress, is 
directly responsible for. 

Congress has recently committed 
the shameful, odious, immoral and 
ominous act of passing the detainee 
bill, also called the "torture bill." This 
was sold to the public as a compro-
mise, but it's actually even worse than 
the original version of the bill , with 
wording so broad that practically 
anyone, anywhere, can be declared 
an enemy combatant. That person no 
longer has the right of habeas corpus, 
a cornerstone of the legal system that 
dates back to the Magna Carta. That 
means that anyone opposing the 
Bush version of facist theocracy can 
be considered a combatant and be 
detaioed and tortured. It is now U.S. 
law. 

Habeas corpus is a judicial man-
date to a prison official ordering that 
an inmate must be brought to court 
so it can be determined if that per-

son is lawfully imprisoned. A writ of 
habeas corpus can be filed in court 
by someone who objects to a prison-
er's detainment. The Magna Carta, 
the great charter, or the Libertatum 
Magna Carta, the greal charter of 
freedom , led to constitutional law as 
we know it in virtually all proclaimed 
democratic countries. It is reflected 
in the U.S. Constitution and the Bill 
of Rights. Am,?ng other things, it 
requires that the rulers must follow 
the law. 

The Bush administration has 
recently been shown to have vio -
lated 26 federal statutes. They have 
repeatedly defied Il1ternational law 
and acted against the wishes of the 
United Nations. They have not acted 
in the interests of the' American 
people. They have repeatedly violateQ 
the principles of democracy. They 
are a criminal regime that must be 
brought to justice. They are the worst 
governing body this country has ever 
experienced. This will be our history. 
Something must be done to bring 
the United States back from its pres-
ent state of lawlessness. Every citizen 
must do his or her part , now, or it will 
be too late.

THE UCSO GUARDIAN THURSDA~OCJ~RS,~ 

Info Database Could Threaten Student Privacy 
• DATAMSE, from page 1 
cymakers to obtain reliable informa-
tion about students' progress through 
the educational pipeline, the report 
stated. 

The data currently available is lim-
ited to fU'st-time, full -time students, 
who comprise about SO percent of the 
student body. This leaves the other 
SO percent of adult returnees, transfer 
students and part-time students unac-
counted for, the commission found. 

Although the apparatus is only one 
small provision in a larger proposal, 
it would help pave the way toward 
achieving other goals, according to 
the commission. 

·We believe that improved 
accountability is vital to ensuring the 
success of all the other reforms we 
propose; the report stated. "CoUeges 
and universities must become more 
transparent about cost, price and stu-
dent success outcomes:' 

However, some sectors of higher 
education have voiced opposition due 
to the possibility of violating exist-
ing privacy laws and the high cost of 
implementation. 

While providing information is 
important, Spellings m~t be cautious 
about the possible risks of such a 
database, according to Association 
of American Universities spokesman 
Barry Toiv. 

"We musf[achieft accountability] 
in a way that doesn't create more prob-
lems than we're trying to solve," Toiv 
said. "It's not a question of ruling out 
the possibility of getting information; 
it's about providing information in a 
way that doesn't threaten privacy." 

The proposed student-tracking 
system would be privacy-protected, 
according to SpeUings; however, a 
method for safeguarding information 
has not been specified. While some 
worry about student privacy, others, 
like Revelle CoUege junior Connor 
Sawaske, don't see a threat in execut-
ing the accountability plan. 

"[A particular student] would 
just be another name on a long list; 
Sawaske said. "' highly doubt it would 
be to the point where someone could 
just look up your name and see how 
you're doing. That kind of thing would 
never fly:' 

Getting approval from Congress 
may pose an uphill battle for 
SpeUings. Last ~arch, the House of 
Representatives passed HR 609, which 
strictly forbids such a unit recorder. 
The House of Representatives and the 
White House have also baclced alter-
native proposals on scientific research 
and education that are more modest 
in scope and costs less, according to 
the Chronicle of Higher Education. 

The implementation of the student 

database alone is estimated to cost S I 0 
million to S 1 00 million, the American 
Council on Education stated. 

In addition, the upcoming 
November election, which could 
change the makeup and possibly the 
control of both houses of Congress. 

"I suspect that [the commis-
sion's report] is not the top thing 
on [Congress'] mind right now," Toiv 
said. 

Higher education officials support 
most of the commission's proposal, 
and regard Spellings' efforts as the 
first steps toward improvement. 

To confront access and afford-
ability, Spellings plans to expand the 
principles of the No Child Left Behind 
Act to high school students in order 
to better prepare them for coUege, 
streamline the federal financial aid 
process to cut the time spent on the 
Free Application for Federal Student 
Aid in half and provide billions in 
federal funds to need-based financial 
aid. 

Spellings' speech calmed the 
nerves of many college officials with 
its repeated emphasis on discourse. 

·We're now hopeful that this could 
be a healthy exercise and that positive 
change is going to emerge," Toiv said.

Hospital Consolidation Will Save Money, Officials Say 
• HOSPITALS, from page 1 
of UCSO's plan, which include the 
Mexican American Professional 
Business Association and Scripps 
Health Chief Medical Officer Brent 
Eastman, say that the report mis-
judged the effects of the change on 
low-income areas. 

"EveD though the closure of 
HiIIcretIjIeds coincides with Thorton's 
expansion, we're talking about 9,000 
patients here," he said. "Where are 
these people going to go?" 

Free transportation between the 
Hillcrest and campus medical centers 
will be able to move patients in cen-
tral and southern regions, according 
to director of VCSD Health Science 

Communications Leslie J. Franz. She 
said critics have overestimated the 
impact of the university's long-range 
plan. . 

"Much of the concern being 
expressed today is based on emo-
tion; Franz stated in an e-mail. 
·Understandable, but not a good basis 
for pIanning.-

The report abo addraaed possible 
conceptions of the change. and sug-
gested that patients orIglnaDy served 
in the Hillcrest area would be con-
cemed "whether they [could] receive 
care elsewhere or not:' 

To combat misconceptions about 
the plan, Franz said UCSQ was forced 
to release a "myth versus fact" sheeL 

No! 

In addition, upgrading the La )olIa 
site will be more cost effective than 
reproducins needed services at the 
Hillcrest loation, which Franz called 
"aging" and in need of repIaoement 
by 2030. 

-The best use of limited resources 
would be to eKpaDd the Thornton

Work Group 
Inadequate, 
Students Say 

• RSO, from page 1 
the report r' 

[n 2005, a similar work group 
commissioned to analyze the role of 
the RSO program. The committee, 
chaired by Revelle College Provost 
Daniel Wulbert, did have thee under-
graduate representatives, but never 
released a report. 

Along with the lack of stu-
dent participation, the content of 
the report posed many problems, 
Khanna said . 

"It is clear .. . by the contents of 
the updated report 00' that the work 
group has misunderstood and misin-
terpreted the. issues most important 
to students," the response stated. 

The response, sent bye-mail 
to Watson and Vice ChanceUor of 
Business Affairs Steven W. Relyea, 
consisted of three pages refuting the 
points made in the original report, 
and urged the administration to 
examine the issue and the program as 
a whole on a deeper scale. 

One of the key issues discussed 
in the original report was an analysis 
of the RSOs' duties and the reported 
shift of various responsibilities from 
residential advisers to the RSOs in 
recent years. According to the work 
group, the fact that RSOs now have 
duties unpopular with students that 
were once performed by RAs, is a 
major factor in student disdain for 
the officers. 

However, the student committee 
believes that the original report did 
not provide enough detailed analy-
sis of the RSO program's function, 
or whether or not it is as effective as 
it could be. 

"The work group does not pro-
vide any reasoning or explana-
tion for refusing to review the job 
description or formal expectations 
of the RSO program; the e-mail 
stated. "This is disheartening as [the 
committee] thought that this was 
the point of the work group envi-
sioned by the U.S.E.S. report." 

Additionally, the original RSO 
report referenced the notion that 
many students have not had much 
experience in handling confronta-
tional situations, due to a culture shift 
in recent years where parents have 
become more protective of their chil-
dren. 

The insinuation itself, according 
to the e-maiI.isinsuiting. 

"The wOlk group did not pre-
sume that students are trustworthy 
or capable of becoming adults and 
contributing members of the UCSD 
community," the response stated. 

Similarly. the student committee 
was not pleased with the report's 
suggestion to administer exams 
throughout the week, especially on 
Fridays. in order to curb the prob-
lem of student alcohol.abuse. 

The response references the idea 
as "almost laughable,w suggesting 
that it would only make life harder 
for. students already dealing with a 
stressful class schedule. 

The response was necessary to 
ensure that administrators continues 
to monitor issues that are important 
to students, GSA representative and 
steering committee member Aaron 
Parker stated in an e-mail. 

"I can assure you that the steering 
committee will discuss these reports 
at length in the near future," Parker 
stated. "One of the reasons for writ-
ing the letter was to ensure that this 
issue didn't fall off the radar." 

Parker added that the committee 
decided against commenting further 
because it had been unable to meet 
si nce the response was released. 

Watson and Relyea did not 
respond to requests for comment 
on the issue. However, according 
to Khanna, WalSon has expressed 
interest to him personally in exam-
ining the problem further in the 
future.

Program 
Quality at Risk, 
Director Says 

• CHINESE, from page 1 
professor Samuel Chao Classes were 
expanded to accommodate the many 
students, First-year Chinese courses, 
he said, have accepted approximately 
20 more students than last year. In 
addition, some students had to be 
turned away for the first time in the 
program's history, 

By enlarging classes, the quality of 
students' education is being compro-
mised. according to Chinese Language 
Program Director Jane Kuo, In lan -
guage courses. Kuo said, class size 
plays a vital role. 

"1 feel that we are sacrifiCing the 
quality of teaching for quantity:' Kuo 
said. "I need to be able to interact with 
the students of the class:' 

In addition to the impacted class-
es. fourth-year Chinese language 
class CH I N 122A and a similar class. 
the fourth-year course CHIN 18SA. 
have been canceled for the quarter, 
Moreover. there will be only one third -
year Chinese language class, CHIN 
III B. offered for students with a native 
Mandarin Chinese language back-
ground. Anderson normally teaches 
the class, but because she took,mater-
nity leave this quarter. Cha was forced 
to substitute for her and the classes he 
normally taught were canceled, 

Students who need to take fourth -
year Chinese for their majors will have 
to wait until next year. 

Due to a conflict in Cha's teaching 
schedule, the CH 1 N 1 \I B class time 
was changed after summer, creating 
problems for students because of the 
short notiCe. 

"Since the class time switched, it 
interfered with another class, and since 
CHIN III B is only offered once a 
year with just one class, I had to drop 
my other class;' Sixth College junior 
Johanna Gan Wd. 

Several ,students qualified for 
CHIN III B were waitlisted for the first 
week of classes until a larger classroom 
became available, and some classes 
were originally filled past fire -code 
regulations until rooms were changed 
to accommodate all of the extra stu-
dents, Lnstruction began during sec-
ond week because of the classroom 
discrepancies. 

Furthering the troubles within the 
Chinese studies program, Education 
Abroad Program students who pent 
the last year in China were originally 
suppo ed to have a class particularly 
designed for them. Resources, how-
ever, are not available for that option, 
according to Chao Instead, EAP stu-
dents were forced to compete with 
other students for access to CHIN 
I II B and many had to waitlist. 

In addition, the department has 
had trouble placing students in the 
correct language levels. 

Using its multi -tracking system. the 
UCSD Chinese studies program places 
students into three tracks, depending 
on the student's particular language 
hi.story. Students who have no Chinese 
language background are placed in the 
first track, students with a background 
in Mandarin Chinese are placed in 
the second track and students with a 
background in other Chinese language 
dialects are placed in the third track. 

To be placed in the correct track, a 
department member must interview 
each student before assigning that stu-
dent to a track. This process is strenu-
ous on staff, Cha said, but the Chinese 
language is too diverse a language to 
narrow placement down to a written 
test. Furthermore, there is no correlat-
ing textbook for each .language level, 
Cha said. 

Bernstein said he was unaware of 
most of the problems the Chinese lan -
guage program is facing, but said that it 
would receive his fuU attention, 

"It is my goal and hope to work 
toward the steady expansion of the 
course offerings and instructional 
opportunitie for students in all areas 
of Asian studies, including Chinese 
studies; Bernstein said.

Cop or robber, 
nothing can block 

the bullet in 
Scorsese's 

latest tribute to 
bloody pavement. 

By Simone Wilson 
HIATUS EDITOR 

No matter how many times we've seen Matt Damon smooth and undercover ("T he Bourne Identityl Supremacy:' "Oceans Elevenl 
Twelve"), Leonardo DiCaprio's on-and-
off accent and ever-deepening middle 
forehead crease ("The Aviator; "Gangs 
of New York") or Jack Nicholson as a 
crazed sexual predator-slash-viUain ("The 
Shining," "Batman" and in reality), it in no 
way prepares us for iheir dynamite compi-
lation by street-crime guru and pioneer-
ing "movie brat" Martin Scorsese. The 
director pulls fresh violence from each 
member of the stacked cast, avoiding what 
could have ended up as a commercial 
yawn with today's celebrities playing dress 
up as Scorsese OGs like Robert De Niro, 
Joe Pesci and Ray Liotta. 

De Niro actually refused the part of 
Frank Costello (reigning kif!g of Boston's 
Irish mob scene) - which Nicholson 
later took - a turn-down that undoubt-
edly transformed the project from a 
"Goodfellas" wannabe into the landmark 
piece of modern thrill and invigorated

If neither DWR or TNT appeal to your premodernist aesthetics, then the Museum of Man's ongoing exhibition "Body Ornamentation: 
Artistic Representations of Self" may be more enticing. An escape 
from acronyms and the new, local art scene. "Body Ornamentation" 
in tead ventures into the historic and universal world of tattoo . 

The exhibit explores the multiple ways in which humans have 
used the body as a canvas, spanning cultures and geography to pres-
ent designs in body painting, tattooing, scarification and piercing. 
Perhaps art and anthropology aren't such different fields after all.

TV on the Radio 
• Return to Cookie Mountain 
4AD 

**** In the midst of all the Sufjan Siumpens, Devandra Whineharts and other pathetic acts of pussy rock not worthy of mention, TV on 
the Radio dumps pretentious poet-ism in favor 
of returning to Cookie Mountain. 

Wait, what's Cookie Mountain? Who knows? 
Who cares? 

Continuing the tradition of defecating gran-
diose "concept alb urns- sprinlded with poetic jar-
gon, TV on the Radio's second LP is riddled with 
intellectual flirtations, leftist agendas and cameos 
from mainstream giant David Bowie and indie 
giant Kazu Makino of Blonde Redhead fame. 

The parts of the album that actually matter 
(a.k.a. the music), however, are brilliant: sound 
collages of slick production, soulfuJ vocals, hip-
hop beats, thick walls of guitars and off-kil-

Whitest Boy Alive 
• Dreams 
ASOUNDIBU88LIS 

For the past six years, Erlend 0ye's musical talents have moved him seamlessly through folk (with Kings of Convenience), electro-
pop (as a solo artist) and, now, minimalist 
rock. With bright red hair and hipster glasses, 
0ye's whispery-crooner vocals tie together the 
three very distinct. projects. His latest group, 
Whitest Boy Alive, juxtaposes a playful band 
name with conservative instrumentation based 
in traditional rock music. The record's title 
accurately defmes it as a whole: One syUable, 
concise and efficient, Dreams reveals 10 uni-
form songs tied together by dry drum kits, soft 
vocals and Power, Corruption and Lies-era New 
Order guitars. 

"Burning;' the album's first and most infec-
tious track, begins with a tight drum pattern 
complemented by a fluid guitar riff conjur-
ing Bernard Sumner ort "Age of Conllellt." "SO 
many people telling me one wayl Caught in a

Jedi Mind Tricks 
• Servants In Heaven, KinKS in Hell 
BABYGRAIIDE 

My honeymoon period with Jedi Mind Tricks held equal infatuation with both producer Stoupe the Enemy of Mankind 
and lead MC Vinnie paz - the former for his 
alluring symphony-hall d amatics and the latter 
his unprecedented ability to push dangerously 
pure testosterone up my passive veins. 

Now that our relationship has reached that 
touchy level of overfamiliarity, I can finally see my 
lovers outside the film of passion. My affair with 
Jedi Mind Tricks-backed supergroup Army of the 
Pharaohs and their early 2006 release The Lost 
Papers could have had something to do with it: 
Featured rappers R.A. the Rugged Man, Reef the 
Lost Cauze and Celph-Titled did to me what paz 
did, only better, and allihose Stoupe beat imita-

, tors could have fooled me in likeness. 
Servants in Heaven, Kings in Hell is our first 

enq)unler since. Stoupe outdoes his former self 
to sweep me up (if only in sound) with Latin rose 

Scissor Sisters 
• Ta-Dah 
UMVD i.MELS 

*** Add some David Bowie to the Jackson Five, insert an Elton John piano intro and a few Atari sound effects, and you've almost 
achieved Ta-Dah, the latest from Scissor Sisters. 
A seasoned stripper from the New York City gay 
club scene, lead singer Jake Shears shapes his 
group of coitus connoisseurs into a digitized glam-
funk, should-be-a-musical cast that may well be 
the ABBA of our generation. But what does an 
achievement of this magnitude sound like? 

It's hard to rival "Tits on the Radio~ - a 
track from their self-titled first album on wtrich 
Shears flamboyantly shrieks "There ain't no tits 
on the radio' on repeat to a get-down bassline 
- but the Scissor Sisters' ~bject mattel'Still has 
the same provocative Bair that took them off 
the Wal-Mart inventory in 2004. Lyrics shine 

ter funky bass lines. Sure, these are the same 
crafts responsible for TV on the Radio's critical 
acclaim for their outstanding first EP Young 
Liars and debut LP Desperate Youth, Bloodthirsty 
Babes. But what sets Return to Cookie Mountain 
apart is the willingness not to experiment. not to 
prove edginess, and not to out-avant-rock every 
other New York band, instead giving a relaxed 
recount of TVOR's unique sound. 

It is admirable that a band born from the No 
Wave revival scene, along with the (early) Yeah 
Yeah Yeahs and Liars, came to carry the same 
aesthetic without sounding No Wave, but soul-
ful and spiritual instead.

prophetically predicting a motion that he duti-
fully maintains for the entire album. Tracks like 
"Golden Cage" and "Fireworks" speak of lost 
love and isolation, while "Don't Give Up· barely 
speaks at all, repeating the song's title over 
Fender Rhodes chords and soft guitars. 

What this all means is that 0ye is too focused . 
Each project he undertakes concentrates loy-
ally on a single texture or theme that is refined 
throughout the recording, and this album pro-
vides a musical scope too narrow to keep a 
listener focused for 10 tracks. Maybe this is just 
what he wants: Coming from Norway, 0ye's 
music mirrors the sparse and beautiful darker 
months of his country. What Dreams never gets 
to are the bright Nordic summers, the changing 
se_lOS or anything to awaken the listener from 
a safe and predictable winter slumber.

paz, sadly, lets me down a little. Maybe I was 
just too lovestruck to see it before, but his w(1lfish

haven't evolved at all since we first met, except in 
the direction of sappy. That's not to say I don't still 
admire his innate skill for writing and slamming 
down hard -as-hell lyrics to really get my blood 
boiling - it's just a little false and overdone by 
now, far outshone by killer guest spots from R.A., 
Reef, Chief Kamachi , Sean Price and obvious 
influence III Bill. "Most of my adult life I've been 
torn into two/ If you love me then I love you and

itself, "She's My Man;' the story of a sex change 
and "I Can't Decide" - decide between two dif-
ferent sex partners, between kissing or fucking

Something extraordinary was expected as a 
follow-up to Scissor Sisters, which made it to the 
tiptop of the UK charts. But Ta-Dah, for all of its 
fanfare, its glitter and its confetti, ends up disap-
pointingly overproduced. So much is packed 
into the punch that it all sort of blends into a 
monotoAous poppy drone - like when you mix 
all the colors of the rainbow and end up with a

'Departed' Cops Out With a Bang in 
AII·Cast Mass-Murder Windup 

• DEPARTED, from page 9 
entertainment that it is. Nicholson wears his 
leopard-print ties and rodent Joker grins with 
a flair that seasoned crime boss De Niro 
would not, and never could, approach. It's 
a performance that's necessary in order to 
avoid too close a resemblance to Scorsese's 
past work - not to mention the stale world of 
pedestrian cop/criminal flicks into which "The 
Departed" is released. Nicholson's Costello, 
drowning in plastic-wrapped bricks of cocaine 
(which he throws to his young mistresses like 
his "Batman" character threw doUars), intro-
duces the "bad guy" like we've never seen him. 
Though a newly fit DiCaprio and authentic 
Bostonian Damon deliver top-notch perfor-
mances as well, their cool would be nothing 
new without Nicholson's bushy-browed growl 
down the backs of two pretty boy necks. 

Scorsese's signature is allover his latest: 
Howard Shore's raging, sudden-cut· rock 'n' roll 
from the Stones, Van Morrison covering Pink 
Floyd and the Dropkick Murphys, heavy jumpy-
action editing by longtime collaborator Thelma 
Schoonmaker and chilling camera angles of the 
down-the-barrel variety. "The Departed"leaves 
no room for viewer disconnect, even at two and 
a half hours, with a storyline (based on "Infernal 
Affairs," a.Hong Kong thriller that could ask for 
nothing greater than the attention of Scorsese, 
an idol of Asian cinema) that doesn't stray far 
from its simplistic formula. 

Two cell phone-upgraded moles (guess 

who) , one planted inside the mob and the 
other inside the law - unaware of each other's 
identity despite screwing the same hot cop 
psychiatrist - are caught in a race not to be 
the first rat discovered_ It's a wonder Scorsese 
could keep such a predictable screenplay on 
high intensity for so long. The feal undoes any 
droopy eyes we might have felt in "Gangs of 
New York" or "The Aviator," and ensures him 
hip to the low attention-span crowd that such 
star-studded action flicks tend to draw. 

How does a filmmaker wrap up a conflict 
with so many strong players and underlying 
alliances? Apparently this wasn't an important 
enough issue on which to spend much valuable 
Hollywood time, because the film's conclu-
sion is even simpler than its premise: kill off 
everyone involved in a blinding bloodbath that 
conveniently ties up all complex loose ends by 
eliminating them completely. Another perk is 
that all morals and messages seemingly raised 
or hinted at are suddenly irrelevant, and the 
marketing department instantly has one easy 
catch-phrase to slap on the posters: · Cops or 
criminals. When you're facing a loaded gun, 
what's the difference?" 

But a cop-out finale can't erase the film's 
triumph as an offering of concentrated entertain-
ment - in fact, the thrills only run steeper uphill

No Intelligent Design to 'God's Army' Doc 

Ichller II fri. , 1:0,.1 c.,1., S,., .... , ... 11 
Savion Glover 

By Oris Mer/all 
CONTRIBUTING WR ITER 

Watching "Jesus Camp:' the controversial new documen-tary about an evangelical sum-
mer camp for kids, I was forced to 
separate my moral standpoint as a 
Christian from my duty as a critic. 
Those raised like the "Kids on Fire" 
camp participants could watch the 
film in its entirety and find nothing 
to convince them that their behavior 
is anything but normal. And that is 
the inherent problem with this docu-
mentary: It fails to make any sort of 
statement on either side, let alone 
engage in any real dialogue. There 
is some sort of pro/ con debate, but 
it comes far too late, and offers only 
generalized arguments. 

Filmmakers Heidi Ewing and 
Rachel Grady foUow evangelical min-
ister Becky Fischer as she puts on 
the multi -week "Kids on Fire" sum-
mer camp in the Midwest. where she 
seeks to train kids as young as six to 
form a self-described "God's Army." 
She wants, in her own words, to have 
the kids "as on fire for God as the 
kids over in Palestine~' The camp and 
its variou participants take on such 
political storms as abortion, globing 
warming ("The temperature has only 
rose .06 degrees," said one of the kids, 
encouraged by a nearby parent. "That's 
not a 10':') and the Supreme Court 
nomination of Samuel Alito. 

"Je$us Camp" attempts an explora-
tion of whether Fischer is exploiting 
and indoctrinating campers. Fischer 
advocates speaking in tongues and 
denounces Harry Potter ("If Harry 
Potter lived in the time of the Bible, he 
would have been burned!" she said), 
emphasizing an "us versus them" men-
tality among the kids. It's distressing to 
see young children honoring a card-
board cutout of George W. Bush as 
a savior of America and being told

. Men's Soccer Looks to Make Up 
Ground on Three-Game Road Trip 
• STRUGGLES, from page 20 

Tannenhaus said he received his second 
yeUow card when he had some less-than-kind 
words for the Sonoma State sideline. 

"One of their assistant coaches was talking 
to me the whole game. I had just gotten fouled 
and I said something back to him, and the ref-
eree overheard it," Tennenhaus said. "I know I 
should not have said anything, but 1 was in the 
zone and I aUowed them to get to me." 

Tannenhaus plans to use the incident as 
future motivation. "Hopefully we will meet 
Sonoma State again in the playoffs." he said. 

The loss was certainly a disappointing one 
for the Tritons, and the job didn't get any easier 
when they took on CCAA newcomer Humboldt 
State on Oct. I . 

Like many of their previous matches. the 
Tritons were able to produce plenty of scoring 
chances against the Lumberjacks, but failed 
to score any goals. Luckily, the Triton defense 
stayed solid and the match ended in a 0-0 tie. 
With Tannenhaus serving his mandatory one-
game suspension for receiving a red card. othe.r 
members of the defense were forced to step up. 

"We had a lot of guys playing out of posi-
tion. bUI they played hard and got the job done," 
Tannenhaus said. 

Although UCSD was able to salvage one 
point from the match. many of the players 

well! disappointed in the dnw. "We played very 
weD. but we just couldn't finish any chances," 
freshman forward Tony Choi said. The Tritons 
outshot the Lumberjacks 16-7 in the match. but 
suffered some bad luck with three shots hitting 
the post 

"It is always unlucky when you hit the post 
three times in one match. but you have to give 
credit to Humboldt State, [which) came out and 
played extremely hard on defense," Choi said. 

With the loss to Sonoma State and the draw 
against Humboldt State, th~ Tritons' record 
fell to 4-3-2 in CCAA conference play and 8-
3-2 overaU. The tearn currently stands tied for 
second place with Cal State Bakersfield in the 
CCAA South Division. 

Despite their poor play of late, the Tritons 
are looking forward to their upcoming road trip 
and the rest of the season. . 

·We have a chance to prove ourselves and go 
out and win games in order to make the play-
offs," Tannenhaus said. 

Choi echoed his teammate's sentiments. 
"We have three big away games coming up so 
we can't dwell on the past," he said. 

The Tritons' three-game road trip began 
with No. 23 Cal State Dominguez Hills on 
Oct. 4 and includes stops at Cal Poly Pomona 
on Oct. 6 and Cal State San Bernardino on 
Oct. 8.

More Tomfoolery Needed at Games 
~ FIRST, from page 20 

Back to the point at hand . I 
came to UCSD knowing that it was 
the most pathetic school-spirited 
university that I could've possibly 
chosen. 

And I w-.Isn't disappointed. 
There wasn't a single visiting fan 

and only one guy sat on the opposite 
side. I continue to believe he was 
there because he hadn't showered in 
over a week and would have been 
threatened by the fans if he didn't 
move. 

Every time the shirtless four 
started yelling. it was in perfect har-
mony and unison, the content of 
their cheers unclear and meek at best. 
They might have a career working as 
the Disneyland quartet, but not as 
cheerleaders. 

At one point , I thought they 
began chanting "Let's go Croutons, 
let's go;' and it gave me a craving for a 
good salad. I was later informed that 
the "croutons" were actually Tritons 
and a good salad was nowhere to be 
found. 

The students were dispersed 
throughout the crowd in groups of 
threes and fours. When the foursome 
tried to get other (ans involved in 
the cheers, it sounded more like a 
scratchy CD that skips and skips and 
skips and skips and skips and is just 
really annoying. 

If I was an opposing fan, I think I 
would've died from laughing at how 
pitiful the attempt was. As a student, 
I wanted to cry and hide myself in 
utter shame. 

What happened to the idea of a 
student section and school pride? 
Isn't that what gets fans spirited and 
loud? 

At one point the gym was so 
quiet' thought I heard one player ask 
another if shea read the new Cosmo. 
Maybe the mom would've been inter-
ested in the shinless guy of the month 
that appears in every issue. 

Worst of all, I think that there were 
more people at the library studying 
on that Friday night than were sitting 
in the stands at the game. That's truIy 
the sign of how pathetic this school 
is': The masses prefer studying over . 
fraternizing at athletic events. 

I always thought that college 

m sure he kept 
asKII~ himself where 
the world is headed 

with a bunch of 
foul-mouthed, 

shirtless men that 
attract older women 
and why he fought in 
three different wars to 
protect free speech if 

this is how he's repaid." 
games would involve hundreds of 
drunken students uniting into one 
community with one voice - one 
group that stands up for everything 
profane and goes to any length for a 
victory. [ know that sounds like some 
grandeur delusion, but hey, a man 
can have his dreams. 

I wanted a school with tailgates, 
pom-poms and spirit shirts, but here 
I am, and I'm making do looking for 
the positive in what seems like only 
negatives. Besides, I'm to blame. I 
knew how bad it was before I got 
here. 

At least students can yell • $&If 
and If·@ 'and &'S·@! without any 
administrators tearing through the 
crowd and punishing the perpetrator 
like they did in high school. 

That's part of the experience I've 
always hoped for, and I took advan-
tage of it the first chance , got. Then 
I realized something: Unlike high 
school, , have no one to turn around 
to and blame if someone actually 
cares. 

So when this old guy four rows 
down turned his head and stared 

·a hole through my head while he 
shook his head , ., felt embarrassed 
because , could only imagine the 
things running through his soon -
to -be Alzheimered mind. I'm sure 
he kept asking himself where the 
world is headed with a bunch of 
foul -mouthed, shirtless men that 
attract older women and why he 
fought in three different wars to 
protect free speech if this is how 
he's repaid. 

But that's what collegiate fans are 
supposed to be like: rude, relentless 
and ridiculous. It's our right. 

Apparently the UCSD student 
body hasn't gotten the message. 

So my plea to students is to get 
their impersonal, antisocial butts 
out of the library or dorm room or 
classroom and plant it in the stands 
with actual other people and root 
on fellow schoolmates as they com -
pete for the pride of this university.

Stolen Thrill of Victory 
Inspires New Campaign 
~ HOCKEY, from page 20 
Championship with a narrow loss to 
the University of Nevada-Reno Wolf 
Pack, the perennial WCRHL champi-
ons and national title contenders. 

"Last year allowed us to realize our 
. potential," Keefe said. He hopes the 

tearn will excel in all aspects of the 
game to win a national championship. 

Last season, Chris Armour, who 
had previously 

"We would have won if my wrist 
was not hurting," said Toso, who led 
the team last season with 39 goals and 
30 assists. Torso has led the team in 
scoring the last three seasons. 

UCSD would go on to lose in the 
NCRHA Championship quarterfinals 
to the State University of New York at 
Brockport, 6-3. Toso did not score in 
the season-ending loss. 

"Marc TQSo is 
coached the A 
team, instead 
coached the B 
team, leaving 
I<eef to pick up 
the slack by act-
ing as a player 
and coach. 

" he players have 
gained a sense of 

hands-down the 
best player in the 
program," Tran 
said. "He sets an 
·example for the 
rest of the team 
- not through 
words, but through 
his actions on the 
rink~' 

"The hardest 
thing we have 
faced is pro-
gressing without 
a coach," Keefe 
said . "Without 
a coach we have 

maturity and 
knowledge that only 
. time can develop?' 

Every player 
_ Thi Tran, Senior Defenseman, returns this sea-

Men's Roller Hockey son to the Tritons 
except forward 

had problems with what to practice, 
and what styles and strategies to use 
in the game:' 

Despite dedicating his energy to 
coaching, Keefe had the second most 
assists on the team, behind standout 
senior defenseman Marc Toso. 

"Brian Keefe did a great job as 
captain and player/coach," sophomore 
defenseman Jeff Ponton said. "He held 
the team together and was able to play 
remarkable defense. Not to mention 
he was one of our top scorers:' 

In the regional championship last 
season, the Tritons lost to the WoIf 
Pack in a heartbreaker. With three 
seconds left on the clock, Keefe took 
a shot at the tying goal that narrowly 
missed because a player pushed the 
net off its mark. University of Nevada-
Reno once again repeated as league 
champions, with a controversial 4-3 
victory. 

Ryan Fisher. Led 
again by Toso, Keefe and junior for-
wards Robin Fago and Brandon CheN, 
the Tritons will once again attempt to 
knock off University of Nevada-Reno 
and make a run for a national cham -
pionship. 

''As the core group of players enters 
its third season together, the players 
have gained a sense of maturity and 
knowledge that only time can develop:' 
Tran said. "As a hockey team, you want 
players to know how each other work 
so that what seems to be chaos on the 
rink from a casual fan's perspective is 
actually a well -oiled machine~ 

The roller hockey team is cur-
rently in the recruitment process, and 
is holding tryouts Oct 4 at Rec Gym. 
The Tritons will kick off the season at 
the WCRHL tournament Oct. 20-23 
in San Jose. Calif. The tournament will 
feature all league teams, including the 
defending champions, the Wolf Pack.

UCSD junior and club roUer hock-
". team captain Brian Keefe and senior 
dde n eman' Thi Tran know what it's 
lik to watch a team grow from inex-
perienced underdogs to national com-
petitors. Now they want to know what 
it's like to be champions. 

"This is our fifth season as an offi-
Cial team, and we've had a great pro-
gression in the last five years:' Tran 
s;ud. "We went from a bUhch of guys 
iu·t wanting to play competitive hock-
e} to a nationally ranked program." 

When Tran helped start the pro-
gram almost five years ago, the thought 
of vying for a national championship 
seemed out of reach. A lot has changed 
since 2002. 

"The rate of our progress is truly 
amazing:' Tran said. "Every year the 
team makes great leaps and bounds to 
goals that seemed out of reach the year 
before. Expect a national champion-
ship this year or the next:' 

The Triton hockey team has 
improved every season. In 2003 the 
team went 7-10-1. The next season 
it improved to 15-2-1 in the regular 
season, along with a second-place fm-
ish in the Western CoUegiate RoUer 
Hockey League Championship and an 
appearance in the National Collegiate 
RoUer Hockey Association Division II 
Tournament. 

Last season the team went 15-1-
2, finishing second; in the WCRHL

After beating two of its toughest 
opponents, Cal State Los Angeles 
and Sonoma State, 4-0 and 4-1, 
respectively, over the past two week-
ends, it seemed that the Tritons were 
on a roU and the wins would only 
get better. 

But Oct. 1 brought in a hum-
bling letdown in front of919 fans in 
the Triton Soccer Stadium bleach-
ers with a tied game to Humbolt 
State, which has only won half of 
its games this season, as opposed to 
UCSD, which is now ranked sec-
ond in California CoUegiate Athletic 
Association league play. 

Triton junior forward Kathy 
Sepulveda explained how the Tritons 
let the game slip away. 

"We were defmitely the bet-
ter team, but our confidence from 
Friday's game came back to haunt 
us," she said. 

The.~tons made sure to take 
hold i£ the intimidation factor 
by being the first to raid the net. 
Sepulveda took a cross pass from 
senior midfielder Kelly Cochran to 
sweep past the Lumberjack k£eper 
in the 56th minute of play for her 
fourth goal on the season. 

"After the goal, relief set in and 
we thought we had it from there; 
Sepulveda said, "But the game 
proved that one goal just wasn't good 
enough. We reIued a bit too much 
where we should haw ~ hard" 

There were a couple more doee 
shots following the first score, but 

the ball and the net never managed 
to meet again for the Tritons, and the 
86th minute caught the Tritons off 
guard when Humbolt State's Jessica 
Hewins netted a comer kick goal to 
bring the game to a 1-1 tie. 

The shot was on a high, bend-
ing ball that flew over the Triton 
defender guarding the post and sank 
to the back right side of the goal, just 
past the hands of sophomore goalie 
Jessica McGovern. 

McGovern recalled how her 
stomach dropped following the ball's 
drop between her posts. 

"For being unintentional, it was 
a perfect shot, one in a million; she 
said. 

Despite out-shooting the 
Lumberjacks by a 22-6 margin and 
holding a 7-2 advantage on corner 
kicks, the Tritons failed to take the 
lead late in the game, an unusual 
break from their last-minute scoring 
in recent games. 

"We have kind of been in a mode 
where we expect things to come, so 
the tie was really humbling and made 
us realize that 1ike the CSULA and 
Sonoma games, we have to make it 
happen if we want it," McGovern 
said "Each game to come this week 
is ftry critical and M! are going to 
make every touch on the baD count." 

The nitons have a cbance to 
earn their fint-pilce spot back In 
the CCM IS they journeyed to Cal 
State I>omiJ18uez ~ ;:..~ 4, and

Senior defenseman Dustin 
Tannenhaus tried to downplay the 
added importance of the UCSD men's 
soccer team's match against Sonoma 
State on Sept. 29. 

"We try to approach every game 
the same way and just execute 
the game plan," team co-captain 
Tannenhaus said. 

Despite these wise words, it's hard 
to believe that the Tritons were not 
looking for some revenge against 
the team that knocked them out of 
the California Collegiate Athletic 
Association semifinals last year. To 
add even more fuel to the fire, the 
Seawolves came into the match with 
a perfect conference record of 7-0-
0, while the Tritons were looking to 
get back on track after suffering two 
straight conference losses. 

Unfortunately, the Tritons were 
unable to hand the Sea wolves their 
first conference loss, falling 2-1 at 
Triton Soccer Stadium. 

After a scoreless first half, UCSD 
was able to take the lead when sopho-
more forward Tom Caplan headed 
a pass from sophomore midfleld-
er Michael Grubic for his second 
goal of the season. After their lone 
goal, a series of unfortunate circum-
stances led to the Tritons fumbling 
away what would have been a huge 
victory. Shortly after Caplan's goal, 
Tannenhaus was ejected after being 
hit with his second yellow card of 
the game, forcing the Tritons to play 
one man down for the remainder 
of the match. The Sea wolves took 
advantage of their extra player and an 
untimely slip by a Triton defenseman, 
when Seawolf Andrew Bailey took a 
perfect pass from Casey Dayton and 
deposited it in the back of the net. 
Sonoma State finished the Tritons off 
when Mike Travis deflected a shot off 
of senior defenseman Devon Cook in 
the 86th minute.
