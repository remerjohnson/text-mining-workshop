, election 
BY JENIFER WARREN 

New. Editor 

The Associated Students 
Council moved last night to 
hold a comprehensive 
referendum during the 
seventh week of this quarter. 
The motion, submitted by AS 
Commissioner of Welfare 
Reggie Williams, was 
approved nine to four with 
one abstention. 

One issue expected to 
highlight 'the referendum is 
the proposed increase in 'the 
student activity fee. The AS 
backed a $4 increase of the $6 
fee during their general 
election last spring, a move 
that UCSD soundly rejected. 

"It's probably obvious that 
students don't want it (the $4 
fee hike), but t·he AS 
desperately needs the funds," 
said AS President Bill 
Topkis. The last increase in 
the fee was in 1968, when it 
w.as raised from $4 to $6. 

o 

Other issue Topkis 
expects to see presented for 

. the student vote include 
alternatives to the current 
form 'of student government, 
fhe tenure proce s, the 
campus policy on incomplete 
grades and co-op hou ing. 

Under the AS-constitution, 
any student group that 
submits a "petition signed br, 
five percent of the ASUCSD ' 
is eligible to sponsor a 
referendum Question. 

If it win enough support 
from students, the proposed 
activity fee increa e must 
also be approved by the UC 
Regents before it is imposed, 
probably by fall quarter.

Vietnam refugee 
o~ 'two-year plan' 
Economics student takes up to 
38 units in a single quarter 

BY KATHY HUFFER 
Editor 

Struggling with 16 units of 
chemistry or history? 

On the five-year plan? , 
Take note, then, of Quang 

Nguyen-; a Vietnamese 
refugee who will graduate in 
June. 

The 21-year-old economics 
major has discovered an 
unusual but cost-effective 
way to attend college: he 
crowds up to 38 units into bne 
quarter and-will graduate in 
seven quarters - two years 
plus one semester session. 

A 1975 immigrant from the 
Socialist Republic of 
Vietnam, Nguyen has 
overcome language barriers 
and a strange culture to 
become perhaps UCSD's only 
two-year graduate. 

He is often accompanied on 
campus by his mother, who 
arrived in this country just a 
year ago. Reserved but 
confident, Nguyen is 
obviously proud of his 
achievements at UCSD. 

With a GPA of 3.2, Nguyen 
may not be a genius, and his 
task has not been easy. And, 
Nguyen asserts repeatedly, 
'he is highly motivated and 
determined to do what most 

ynder~aduates think is 
ImposSible. 

N~uyen has earned a 
respite from the rigor~ of last 
year, when he took 38 units 
one quarter and 32 another. 
With only 24 units this 
quarter, he has been able to 
find time for teaching as an 
assistant for Economics 2B, 
going to the beach and 

pursuing other hobbies, 
He avoids breeze classes 

and has even struggled 
through several graduate-
level classes. 

A C-average high school 
student in Vietnam and 
Pennsylvania, Ngu¥en's 
ability to graduate in two 
years astounds friends, 
family members - and even 
himself. . 

"In Vietnam I wasn't a top 
student at all," he recalls. "I 
was just kind tlf a very 
relaxed student. I liked to 
have fun; I didn't worry 
about school. I was being 
forced to go to school, reallx, 
in high school in Vietnam. ' . 

In fact, Nguyen's first year 
out of high school was spent 
teaching part-time at his 
alma mater and trying to 
decide if he should even go on 
to college. 

But when he visited UCSD 
after moving to San Diego 
two years ago, he kn'ew that 
university life was just what 
he wanted . 

"I did not apply for UCSD 
until I came to Cali{ornia," he 
says. ('About 10 days before 
the school started at UCSD I 
applied for it. I walked right 
into the admissions office and 
I just applied, and they 
interviewed me right there. I 
did n ' t eve n 'h a v e my 
transcript, " 

When Nguyen began 
classes at UCSD he had the 
hum blest of academic 
aspirations. 

"When I first came to 

(;,lIIrtli"I/ 1~'tJllI hI" I'hillip I./I ,i".< 
Whiz kid Quang Nguyen 

UCSD, I never dreamed of 
graduating even in three 
years," he says. "And the 
first Quarter in thi school I 
took 12 units - very small-=-
and did well in them." 

It was only after talking 
with several professors that 
first quarter that Nguyen 
"became motivated" and 
nurtured thoughts of 
graduating early. 

In his second quarter, 
. Nguyen signed up for 20 

unIts with the intention of 
graduating in three years. 
Such a goal, of course, was. 

not entirely unreasonable -
except that he planned to 
major in economics, 
philoeophy andmathematic 

Three majors? _ 
"All right. I do not need to 

have three majors," he 
decided at the end of the 
second quarter. "I may want 
to graduate a little early. How 
about trying to graduate in 
two years with one major and 
two minors?" 

So Nguyen expanded his 
academic diet spring quarter,

First gun control, then what? 
Editor: 

Whenever a popular public 
figure is murdered where the 
perpetrator used a handgun, 
active discussion of gun 
aIItroI htn,W, foIDwI. 
T.tle reaction to John 
Lennon's death is a-case in 
point_ What I would like to 
explore is not the merits of 
gun control per se, but 
whether any "I oontrols 
can ever be effective in 
solving social problems. 

,The gun control issue is 
but one example of people 
screaming for the removal of 
a potentially harmful agent 
from society. Alcohol, drugs 
and pornography are a few of 
the other items which have 
been considered inherently 
detrimental. Alcohol and 

drugs offer two concrete 
examples of the futility in 
attempting to control the use 
and sale of somethiri'g the 
public desires. The absurdity 
surrounding Prohib'tion, 
where there was utter 
disregard for existing laws, 
forced eventual repeal of the 
18th Amendment. 

. Today, certain drug use is 
prohibited. However, you 
only have to ask the nearest 
high school student to find 
out how easy it is to obtain 
marijuana, hashish, cocaine 
and other illicit drugs. Surely 
if handguns were outlawed, 
like alcohol a century ago and 
drugs now, there would be 
prevalent and deliberate 
inattention to such an action. 
Thus it must be asked 

Colleges fake identity 
Editor: 

[ would like to assail the four college councils' absurd. 
,arguments against a unified graduation ceremony_ 

Lisa Sullivan's article (Guardian, Jan. ]9) reflects that the 
co~ncils want to protect our four;college system. I personally 
beheve that the four-college system here is a farce. We 
st\ldents all go t6 the same classes, parties and events_ The 
only _difference between the colleges is the general education 
reqUirements. 
\ ~he ~rren Council thinks that "each college provides an 
intimate and comfortable atmosphere where students feel 
they are accomplished human beings as oposed to-a.number." 
What so~ of lu.dicrous, moronic reasoning is this? There is no

mevltable. The members of the Warren Council are either

CalPIRG charges 

BY DAVID X. DURKIN 
It was with both disappointment 

and anger that I recently read the 
Guardian's Jan. 19 cover story on 
CalPIRG, the California Public 
Intere~ t Research Group. This 
disappointment resulted not from the 
criticisms leveled against CalPIRG by 
persons quoted in the article, though 
some of those criticisms do come from 
sources with questionable reliability. 
Rather, my disappointment and anger 
resulted from the Guardian's use of 
sensational and untrue headlines in 
combination with the article's patent 
distortion of past CalPIRG projects 
and current programs. It is to these 
last two points that I address this 
commentary. 

The most damaging error in the 
Guardian's article was the bold 
headline stating that "CalPIRG Gets 
$$$ - What About Us? Consumer 
Action Group has no programs for 
UCSD" (emphasis added). It seems 
highly unprofessional for a news 
journal such as the Guardian to omit 
CalPIRG's projects list for the Winter 
and Spring quarters of 1981 after 
making such a bold and categorical 
statement in the chosen headline 
caption_ Had the Guardian chosen to 
print the current projects list that was 
provided by me to the author of this 
article, the UCSD reader would have 
discovered 15 on-going projects in' the 
current _uJliversity quarter : 
CaIPIRG"s consumer assistance 
hotline; our 21st food price survey; a 
major appliance price survey; a 
nursing home study which will follow 
up on the state legislation prompted 
by CalPIRG's 1976 study; our SDG&E 
utility rate hike legal intervention 

David X. Durkin is an attorney and 
CaIPIRG Executive Director. 

project; the preparation of a San Diego 
utility rights manual; the San Diego 
State University funding referendum; 
CalPIRG's center of science for the 
community: a guide to low cost 
mortgage and home improvement 
loan programs; a guide to childbirth 
alternatives in San Diego; our urban 
pest control project ; CalPIRG's 
statewide truth-in-testing legi lative 
project; an asbestos in schools project ; 
and CalPIRG's housing project - an 
effort which has addressed critical 
tenant concerns such as rent control, 
condominium conversion and housing 
discrimination. At least three-
quarters of these projects will provide 
substantive benefits to the UCSD 
student community. All of these 
projects are designed to benefit the 
San Diego community . Such an 
ommission by the Guardian does not 
bode well for thecredibilityofUCSD's 
most widely read campus newspaper. 

The second major error in the 
Guardian's CalPIRG article concerns 
the discussion of CalPIRG projects 
undertaken during our last fiscal 
year. After correctly noting the 
organization's total 1979-80 fiscal 
year budget, the article lists only five 
projects undertaken during that time 
period - an omission of at least 12 
other projects including price surveys 
of food, ban,!cing ser.vices and credit 
cards; legal projects designed to lower 
utility rates and provide assistance for 
tenants displaced by condominium 
conversion; consumer guides on low-
cost nutritious foods, solar businesses 
and home/ garden pesticides; and 
legislative efforts on issues such as 
item pricing, condo conversion, used 
car warranties and bottle/can deposit 
requirements . I believe that CalPIRG 
deserves credit based upon what 
actually was done, not on a gross 

'Guardian' libeled it 
misrepresentation of what was done. 

In writing this commen tary, I feel 
obligated to note some additional 
assertions in the Guardian's article 
which I believe to be incorrect . 
misleading or imcomplete. First, the 
article states that I view student 
contributions to CalPIRG as a "sort of 
tax" on students. In that the UCSD 
CalPIRG fee is completely voluntary, 
it is wholly inappropriate to 
characterize it as a "tax" of any kind . 
Second, the article asserts that lack of 
student involvement is CalPIRG's 
biggest problem at UCSD. The 
Guardian neglects to comment on 
those institutional barriers which I 
mentioned as an important factor in 
restricitng student internships with 
CaIPIRG. Indeed, the entire topic of 
CalPIRG's UCSD internship program 
is scarcely mentioned by the 
Guardian. 

In closing, I would like to discuss 
some basic facts about CalPIRG 
which I believe were totally deleted 
from the Guardian's coverage . 
CalPIRG is a non-profit and non-
partisan consumer education and 
advocacy organization that has been 
serving the San Diego community 
since 1972. In a recent visit to San_ 
Diego, consumer advocate Ralph 
Nader described CalPIRG as one of the 
most effective PIRG's in the country. 
The CalPIRG corporation is 
controlled by a student board of 
directors who develop organizational 
priorities in conjunction with a paid 
Executive Director. Of CalPIRG's 13 
staff persons, only two are paid by 
student funds . The salaries received 
by CalPIRG staff persons are 
substantially less than those paid by 
government and private industry. 

The purpose of CalPIRG is toutilize 
student resources, both human and 

financial. to address community 
concerns and issues. In so doing, 
CalPIRG serves students as members 
of the larger class of San Diego 
consu mers. CalPIRG' s price surveys 
and consumer education projects are 
designed not only to assist consumers 
in coping with inflation, but also to 
provide the political credibility that is 
necessary for influential and effective 
legislative projects. 

I hope that UCSD students will be 
critical of unsubstantiated cynicism 
about CaIPIRG _ Certainly, CalPIRG 
cannot resolve many of our society's 
most serious ills. Yet, our consumer 
education, advocacy and legislative 
projects have achieved important 
success in making San Diego a safer 
and more affordable place in which to 
live and work. At only $2 per quarter, 
or less that half the cost of a record 
album, it's a pretty good deal.

and a decrease in the number of

One of the UC Student Lobby's 
main goals this year, accordingtoa 
lobby spokesman, is to have 
enacted a "truth in testing" law 
for standardized testing agencies 
that would go further than Marks' 
bill. It would require them to 
inform test-takers what the exams. 
are supposed to measure or 
predict, tell subjects how their test 
scores will be reported to schools 
and provide guarantees that the 
scores will be released on time or 
the subject will be notified if they 
aren'\.

New bill to require 
test disclosures 

BY RICK DOWER 
Sacra menlO Correspondent 

Students taking college 
and profess ional chool 
admissions test would be 
granted the right to ee their 
corrected exam along with 
the right answers under a bill 
introduced this week in the 
state Senate. 

The bill , SB ] 0], p'roposed 
by Milton Marks, R·San 
Francisco, would also require 
test sponsors to notify all 
testee in advance of their 
right to request that their 
test and answers be 
returned. 

Marks aid his bill is aimed 
at bringing "fairnes and 
openness" to tandardized 
testing in California. 

Each year, thousand of 
would·be st udents take the 
college board entrance 
exams, known as SATs, and 
admissions tests for medical, 
law, business and other 
graduate schools. Test scores 
usually weigh heavily on an 
applicant's chances of being 
admitted. 

"Ba ically, I see this as an 
issue of fairness ," said 
Mark . "I believe the tudent 
shou Id have the right to know 
why he or she did poorly on 
an exam of this magnitUde, 
which will greatly affect hi 
or her life." 

Because New York tate 
has 'enacted a similar law 
regarding . disclosure of te t 
cores and answers, taker of 

the tests there can already 
request to see their corrected 
exams.

university's "let's weed out 
as many as we can' attitude. 
The point is, people - not 
blacks, not whites, but people 
- are leaving UCSD ' in 
disgust. 

Changes of this variety are 
worthwhile - but please, let 
us not be racist in requesting 
administrative change. Let's 
throwaway those phony 
"Third World" labels and 
banners to r~ui::st change for 
the good of all students.

A ignificant segment of 
the Irqnian parliament 
suspected darker dealings. 
They questioned the reasons 
for the pres ure to ettle the

Accordingly, they balked and

I ran 's cau e was just and the 
Uni ted States was bargain· 
ing in good faith. then what 
difference would a-change in

In the context of this 
que ·tion. the only reason 
that comes to mind for such 
haste is that Iran's political 
leader ' were cooking up a 
"deal" with t he Carter 
Administration. This smacks 
of collus ion , of course. Did 
the mullahs really sell out in 
the end?

conflict with Iraq be resolved

will be forced to confront the

people are angry and 
depressed , and their hilt er 
questions go on and on . 
Iranian leaders had better

Second-hand smoke still in our ·eyes 
Report author says little is made of his groundbreaking research 

BY KATHY FINE 
Eleven months after the publication of his 

study on the ill effects of cigarette smoke on 
nonsmokers, Dr. James White of the UCSD PE 
department seemed disappointed but unsurprised 
by the slow progress in eliminating smoke· filled 
environments. 

His results clIused smoking to be banned in 
UCSD classrooms, but this is only a small 
fraction of the world. . 

Dr. White believes tobacco company 
propaganda is keeping the public in a nicotinic 
mist. 

After 10 years of unfunded research, after 
plugging with metal tongs the noses of 2,100 
people and instructing them to blow into a 
cardboard tube for a pulmonary function test, Dr. 
White reported that "there was no significant 
difference between passive.smokers, the smokers 
who did not inhale, and the light smokers. This 
finding suggests that if long-term small-airways 
dysfunction is occurring, the nonsmokers who work in a smoky environment 
have about the same risk of impairment as do smokers whodo not inhale and 
smokers who inhale between one and 10 cigarettes per day." 

Two other studies had similar results. The Paarc study showed that 
nonsmoking spouses of smokers had lower pulmonary function scores and 
Tager's study demonstrated the adverse effects on small-airway function in 
children with parents who smoked. 

"There is a growin({ wave of resen tmen t to being poll u ted," sai d Dr. Whi te, 
"and the nonsmoker IS willing to be more verbal, but as long as people will be 
persuaded by the tobacco companies and don't demand a smoke-free 
environment, it will continue." 

He fears that tbe tobacco companies, with the funds to burn money as well 
as cigarettes, will not let his own light on the subject interfere with their big 
business. 

Since his research was published, White has received 800 letters from 
around the world, including the USSR, Japan, France, Poland and Canada. 
They requested reprints of his article and commented on the need to have 
restricted smoking areas. 

Hundreds of people wrote asking him to set up smoke-free working 
environments. <?ne individual in the midwest, who is allergic to smoke, 
wrote to tell White that the company forces him to wear amaskat work soas 
not to disturb the smoking habits of the other employees. His health is at the

Movie-goers entering USB 2722 at 8:20 pm last

Most of the tests are developed 
by the Educational Testing 

. Service in Princeton and Berkeley, 
and administered by various 
clients, who can set their own 
policy regarding returning tests. 

"The idea is, if you could have 
your test returned with the right 
answers you could probably get a 
good idea of exactly what you did 
wrong and take the test over," 
Pane said. 

"Another reason fQr disclosure 
is to assure students that the 

computer didn't grade their tests 
wrong. As it is now, there's no real 
way of knowing. " 

Pane said that in the course of 
his research for Marks he found 
that while some testing agencies 
are willing to disclose the test 
answers, others seemed "fright-
ened" to do so. "That in itself 
raises a lot of questions," Pane 
said.

commentary 

Where's the fun in rock'n'roll? 
BY MICHAEL ALVAREZ 
Whatever happened to 

rock'n'roll? Maybe because of 
its wid spread acceptance, it 
no longer has any challenges 
or ob>tacles to cross and 
therefore has lap ed into 
blandness. Maybe most rock 
performers have just become 
Jaded. Whatever the reason, 
the majority of the music 
regarded as "rock" nowadays 

lacks t he vi tality and urgency 
which characterized it in the 
pa t. The charts are filled 
with sa ppy, insubstantial 
pop; grat ing. suburban jungle 
noi es; or overblown , 
grandiose stabs at "signifi-
cance." None of it is really 
very satisfying, but YOU 
bought it! You know you did! 
Of course, there have been 
some shining moments in 

music which have been 
excruciatingly pleas urable, 
but those were too few and 
far between. 

Pop mu ic especially is in 
bigtrouble.lti infuriating to 
think that pop pioneer like 
Chuck Berry, The Beatles 
and Buddy Holly have gone to 
the trouble of setting the 
record straight, 0 to speak, 
for the ake of a mere parade 
of pers onalities (having 
personalities is one thing; 
being a personality is quite 
another!). Also irksome is the 
fact that such lackluster 
kitsch has such drawing 
power. If musical taste is 
reflective upon the listener, 
as I believe it is, western 
culture must be mottled by 
huge dead zones. Pop need 
not be a body of great 
intellectual thought, yet 
should not be as vacuous as it 
has become. It is hard to 
believe that such trifles as 
imagination and sincere 
emotion (as opposed to fake 
posing) are in such short 
supply as to completely 
deplete pop music to mere 
nothingness . 

The Clash 

Althou~h one purveyor of 
this "art ' is a good as the 
next (or as bad as the next, 
depending upon your point of 
view), the convenient and 
almost classic case is that of 
the Doobie Brothers. Why 
classic? Although they never 
had remarkable popsensibili-
ties , the Doobie Brother 
have managed to "sell out" 
their own brand of cloyingly 
accessible rock in favor of a 
spineless and.. predictably 
more popular form of pop.

generating fun in the grand 
manner of Badfinger or the 
Raspberries. Although the 
latter two bands made it their 
business to create fun mu i , 
they have never appeared 
business- like . Pop st ill 
thrives in some blessed 
bastions (listen to the 
Pretender's album and 
Blondie's Parallel Lines); but 
then, there are always 
exceptions to the rule. 

The plight of rock'n'roll 
would be laughable if it 

weren't so pathetic. Classical 
music buffs view it as 
unbridled noise being 
produced by long-haired, 
beer-guzzling slobs. Funny 
thing is, they're mostly right. 
Much of today's rock is 
cacophonous music to-kick-
some-ass-by (supposedly). 
The official story is that the 
music is reflecting youthful 
rebellion . How ridiculous: 
The main motivation behind 
such music is the acquisiiton

Black art at 
Mandeville Gallery 

BY OLENKA KARPINSKI 
After a quick introduction to the exhibition, 

" Impress ions/Expressions: Black American Graphics," 
and after reading about its artists and their works, I sat in 
the Mandeville gallery, alone, overwhelmed by the 
accomplishments of black printmakers (and black artists) 
in America. 

This exhibition is a celebration of black America's 200th 
year history in printmaking. Richard Powell, creator of the 
exhibition and a Rockefeller Fellow at the Metropolital 
Museum of Art , learned that black American artists had a 
history in printmaking that traced back to the 18th century 
- a time when blacks were denied entrance into trade 
unions and schools where skills for printmaking were 
primarily acquired . 

With the support from The Studio Museum of Harlem, 
New York, and from The Gallery of Art at Howard 
University, Washington DC, Powell collected more than 
100 prints dating from 1773 to the present. The collection, 
which took two year to~ther, was presented last year at 
The Studio Museum a 'Impressions/Expressions: Black 
American Graphics, " the most comprehensive exhibition 
of print by Afro-Americans ever collected. The 
Smithsonian Institute' Traveling Exhibition Service 
(SITES) has organized this significant exhibit intoa nation 
wide tour compiled of 63 prints by 55 artists. 

The exhibition i presented chronologically, beginning 
with a reproduction of Scipio Moorhead's engraving 
"Phyllis Wheatley, 1773," a print of an escaped slave girl ,

Let's not short-change the 
art of Toulouse Lau~rec 

BY BLAKE SHAW 

Pictures of works of art have never been 
e nough for me. If I can't see the ery hues the 
artist put down or if I can't see it in its actual 
s ize, I am usually disappointed and unable to 
become very intere ted in either the art ist ~r 
his work. 

If you feel the same way I do. you hould be 
happy to know that a col!ect ion of 
approximately 100 works by Henri Toulo~se­
Lautrec is on exhibi~ at the San DIego 
Museum of Art in Balboa Park, now through 
Feb. l. 

The exhibit i the first public viewing in 
eight year of the Baldwin M. Baldwin 
Foundation Collection. It includes all 31 
po ters that Lautrec made. as well. a . many 
lithograph , ink sket~hes and pamtmg . A} '0 
included i . a thirty mmute VIdeo pre entallon 
on Lautrec' life. 

Lautrec was born into an aristo ratic 
family in southern France in 1864. At 14, he 
broke both legs, which never healed properly, 
and at full growth he stood four feet six 
inches. E caping the aristocratic life he cou ld 
never fit into, he tra eled to Paris to ·tudy.art. 
Unlike the Impressionists of hi day, he had 
little talent for, and lit tIe de ire to paint 
land capes. Instead he concentrated on 
people among whom he lived - the denizen' 
of the Parisian nightlife. His landscapes, 
when he used them. were only an accessory to 
make hi figures more tangible. 

• Thi is not to say his visual backgrou!1ds 
are unimport ant. They are uncl.uttered, 
giving primary attention to the subJ~t. Yet 
every d tail he includes a~ds to the .vIewer's 
understanding of the su bJect and gIVes new 
meaning. 

A fine example is his colored lithograph, 
"Le Jockey," which happens to be my 
personal favorite. In it. all elements suggest 
movement - from the angled, long blade of 
grass to the windmill. blowi~g f1a~s and 
turbulent skies, to the angle m whIch he 
'draws horses. emphasizi ng their enormous. 
mu 'cular haunches. 

Other examples of hi s sparse, but 
important detail can ~ found in.the Elles 
series of lithographs. 1 hese s tudIes of the 
women of the "maisons clo e "- or brot hels 
----' of the Rue d'Amboise in Paris. were done 
while Lautrec was act ually living in a brothel. 

In the lithograph which serves as a cover 
for the ·eries. a prostitute i shown combmg 
her flowing hair. Her back is turned, and an 
expensive hat rest ing on the bed is the only 
indicat ion we have of a patron . 

In "La Clownes e Assise." worn-out 
sexualit y is ' presented. A pro titute whose 
best years have passed sits on a bright red 
doorstop, dres ed gaudily in a loud yellow 
outfit. her legs spread WIde. In the shadows. a

Where's the fun in rock? 
continued' from pale 7 
of money, sex and adulation. 
This completely negates any 
sense of rebelhon because it 
sllows d~dence upon t~ 
ever·mahficent "system .' 
These schmoes merely take 
the short cut to the VIctuals 
which they hardly deserve in 
the first place. Also, at the 
heart of every rebellion is an 
ideal. and narcissism is 
hardly. a thing wort h striving 
for. Granted, some "heavy 
metal" is fun, but usually 
only "in spite of" and not 
"because of" the music. 

By contrast, the Sex 
Pistols were much noisier 
and excessive than most · 
heavy metal bands. yet were 
possibly the freshest breath 
of air in a dismal rock scene. 
This is because they directed 
-.11 the elements of crashing 
chords and primal screams 
towards a fixed ideal: 
anarchy (granted, I would 
/tale an anarchic state, but 
used as a symbol of 
irrepressible fury, it's a 
marvel). The best of New 
Wave!Punk rock as exempli· 
fied by the Sex Pistols, the 
Clash, and the Pretenders 
(they deftly walk a fine line 
between pop and new Wave) 
has accomplished what 
heavy metal bas been 
claimtng . to do for quite a 
while. Of course, as can be 
expected , that movement 
also petered out into a trendy 
sort of thi!li. How sad. 

One faCet of rock really 
should not be distinguished 
by its title. It contains none of 
the essential components 
which are present in all good 

Joey Molla~d and Tom Evans of Badfinger 
rock·like vitality, freshness 
and above all, youth . 
Constantly striving " to 
boldly go where no band has 
gone before," progressive 
rock remains leaden with its 
own self·importance, even at 
the spastic velocities it has 
been known to attain. It is 
overly serious instead of 
being fun (although fun is a 
pretty serious business in 
Itself) and manages to 
completely screw gullible 
listeners because of the 
intellectual dogmas it ,pves 
birth to. (How many times 
have you heard: "It takes real 
intelll~ence to appreciate this 
stuff? Hold it - how many 
times have you said: "It takes 
real intell.nce ..... ) • 

ProgressIve rock seems to 
be a contest between various 
bands to.see how many airs 

. each can put up in the length 
of one album. Of course, it 
could be argued that "fun" is 
detrimental to rock because it 
will never escape that 
stereotype, but notice this: 
the music which tra s 
produced the most sweeping 
changes has been that which 
was fun. Look at Chuck 
Berry. Look at the . early 
Beatles. No sweeping social 
messages there, but ' only 
songs about girls and 
"steppin' out" and other 
staples of the rock myth. ' 
From this is should be 

;' obvious that rock 'n'roll has 
enough inherent power to 
accomplish its goals without 
having to resort to pig·shaped 
blimps or neo·c1assical 
{llotifs. The well· worn word 
"pretentious" jumps to mind . 
here.

Black art at gallery 
continued from page 7 
and. a reproduction of Patrick H. Reason's engravin~ of the 
antt·slavery I~cturer, "Henry.Gibb, 1848." (The originals of 
tttese two pnnts are not avaIlable for showing.) 

Presented next is a group of prints representative of the 
Work Progress Administration's Federal Act Projects 
(WPAlFAP), 1935·1942. which funded American artis ts 
and allowed them to exp~nd printmaking techniques and to 
exp.lore a greater variety of subjects. Themes during this 
penod ranged from boogie,woogie entertainment to Afro· 
American awareness. 

This latter theme emanates from Sargent Johnson's 
lithograph ,. "Leno?, Avenue." Johnson says of the piece: "I 
am prodUCing stnctly a Negro art. Very few artists have 
gone ... back to the sources and origins of the life of the race 
in this country. It is the pure American Negro I am 
c~nc~rn~ with, aiming t~ ~ho~ the natural beauty and 
dlgmty In that charactenstlc lip and that characteristic 
hair. bearing and m;mner. And I w·ish to show that beauty 
not so much to the white man as to the Negro himself. 
Unless I can interest my race, I am sunk. " 

A variety of factors has shaped the direction of Black 
American printmakers since 1945, such as the Civil Rights 
Movement, the Cultural Revolution of the 60s and Black 
Nationalism. The latter factor is seen in a lithograph by 
Calvin Burnett, entitled, " Marcus Garvey, 1964.' The 
planographic print describes Garvey by using broad 
strokes of black ink, showing that the black leader had . 
much vigor and enthusiasm in heading a national 
movement to procure an African homeland for black 
Americans. 

Feminist ideology also influenced many of the artists' 
work and is portrayed in a linoleum cut by Nefertiti 
"Get;ting Fixed to Look Pretty, 1978." The piece is ~ 
partIcularly good example of skill and precision in the relief 

printin~. . . 
Political arid societal issues are only two of the 

exhibition's many themes. Inspiration has no fences, as 
John E. Dowell,}r., illustrates in his lithograph, "Letter To 
My Betty, I, 1970." In this piece, scratches an~ almost 
unrecegnizable scribblings against a lined background 
resemble musical notes flying loose on staff paper. 

The exhibition will be showiqg at the Mandeville Art 
Gallery through Jan . 28. Exhibition hours are from noon to 
5pm, Sunday through Friday, and from 7 pm to 9 pm on 
Wednesdays.

Eastern philosophies 
meet western athletes 

BY BEN MARCUS 
Staff Writer 

Out to prove that "there are more than three major sports" 
on the UCSD campus, the new coach of the fencmg team 
hopes to make UCSD a major power in intercollegiate fencing 
by approaching the sport in a unique way. 

Canole (his only legal name) received the head coaching 
position this fall. A convert from Zen Buddhism to T'aoism, 
Canole utilizes a style of coaching quite different from the 
standard emphasis at UCSD on conditioning and technique. 

Canole believes, however, that "sportsmen should identi!y 
themselves as intellectuals as well as athletes. ". He 
incorporates Eastern Philosophl with Western fencing as a 

·way of conditioning the minds 0 the team. Each of the two-to· 
three-hour workouts , held five days a week, begins with 15 
minutes of slow-motion drill based on T'ai Chi. 

In using martial arts, Canole feels the fencers will be able to 
integrate their minds and bodies into one efficient unit" and 
thus improve their fencing abilities. 

The response of the team to this new s tyle of instruction is 
generally a positive one. Most of the fencers like the 

~ychological orientation of the program. One fencer said, 
'He (Canole) not only strives to improve your fenci ng abi lity, , 

he also teaches you how to become a better perwn. He teaches 
yoU fencing, not' competition." . 

Canole's technique is proving to be productive as well. La t 
week the team defeated UCLA, maktng that their third 
consecutive win. 

Canole has seven former UCSD fencers aiding him in 
specialized areas of fencing, among them Kathy Kassebaum 
with the foil and Richard Sax in the sabre. 

Cage teams out pointed 
Point Loma's ability to 

handle a UCSD press was the 
key to a 97-82 Crusader 
victory Tuesday night at Pt. 
Loma. 

The Tritons held close in 
the first half,downonly ~41 

. at intermission. Pt_ Loma 
pulled away at the start m the 
second half and UCSD was 

never able to close to within 
12 poiJits. . . 

Both teams shot well from 
the floor, Pt. Lorna hitting 60 
percent and UCSD 56 
percent. 

Earlier that night, the 
women's team lost tb the 

. Crusaders, 81-54. Mary Egan 
'Ied UCSD with 18 points . .

It might just be coinciden-
tal, but when precisely 181 
basketball teams signed up, to 
play in Winter Quarter 81. 
both cZJrs immediately 
looked over their shoulders 
for an omen_ .. The 181 
repr:esents another all·time 
UCSD record for participa-
tion, a growing trend that has 
facilities bursting at the 
seams and the czars 
scurrying for rover. The 
following table charts the 
one-year vowth rate in 1M 
participatIOn for just the 
Winter Quarter. 

After two weeks of 
sometimes ragged. some-
times intense early-season 
play, it aypears that a power 
base 0 strength has 
accumulated in a number of 
select intramural basketball 
leagues. If you're looking to 
watch highly competitive 
basket ball. UC SD·style. 
check any of the following

appear to be the strongest of 
the lot.

'Old Testament written 
by 100-150 authors 
'Five Books' not 'written by Moses alone 

BY JONATHAN KROLL 
Staff Writer ! 

There is not one author of the Old 
Testament. but rather "One hundred to one 
hundred and fifty authors." says Richard 
Friedman, UCSD professor of literature and 
director of the Judaic Studies Program. 

Friedman often discusses who wrote the 
Five Books of Moses - The Torah (Hebrew for 
"to teach") - and why and when they did so. 
He's teaching a class on it this quarter. 
General Literature 116. "Who Wrote the 
Bible?" / 

"The traditional explanation is that these 
Five Books were written by Moses." says 
Friedman . "However. nowhere does it say in 
the Fi~~ Books that they were written by 
Moses. 

The language and historical references also 
suggest that Moses alone did not write it. 
according to Friedman. If. Moses had written 
it. wouldn't he have referred to himself in the 
first person Friedman asks. 

Another example is the section describing 
Moses' death. one which he would have had a 
difficult time writing. 

.And. Spinoza. according to Friedman. 
singled out the Biblical line "Moses was the 
humblest man on earth." saying Moses 
wouldn't write that. says Friedman. 

Also. "doublets" - two versions of the same 
story - provide puzzling contradictions if one 
author is to be assumed. One example of such 
contradictions is seen in the story of the flood 
in Genesis. 

In Genesis 6:19. God tells Noah to bring one 
pair of each animal: "And of all the living. of all 
flesh. you shall bring two to the ark to keep, 
alive with you. they shall be male and female. ' 

The second version of the same story, 
Genesis 7'2, describes Noah taking seven pairs 
of "clean" animals and one pair of unclean: 
"Of all the clean beasts. take yourself seven 
pairs. man and his woman; and of the beasts 
which are not clean. two, man and his 
woman." 

There are many other sections where "two 
stories are similar yet different in crucial 
ways," says Friedman. 

Biblical scholars have tried to explain these 
contradictions. Jean Astruc. a French 
physician, hypothesized at the end oft he 19th 
century that there were two different styles 
and therftore two different authors. Other 
styles and atJthors were discovered and the 
theory that a number of writers wrote the 
Bibk over a long time is called the 

Documentary Hypothesi . ' according to 
Friedman. 

"Scholars began to find other authors, other 
styles. to 

There are four major authors and a 
"Redactor." an editor that wound these four 
together. Friedman believes. 

Various authors wrote different versions for 
political and religious reasons, Friedman 
thinks. 

For example. the descendants of Moses in 
the Priesthood wrote Deuteronomy r.rior to 
the 7th century B.C .• says Friedman. ('Part is 
possibly written by Moses. The. middle 
chapters are written in the first person.") 

The Book of Deuteronomy then. like now. is 
read in public every seven years. "In 
Deuteronomy. Aaron is made out as a louse." 
Said Friedman. "and so the descendants of 
Aaron wrote their own Torah. 

"There were two Torahs floating around 
Israel for one hundred years. to 

Several times there were competing 
versions of the Five Books of Moses. says the 
Documentary Hypothesis. "which explai ns all 
the contradictions in the Bible. 

"Why didn't they give each version its own 
name. like the book of Matthew and Luke in 
the New Testament?" questions Friedman . 

"Because everyone was claiming that their 
version was written by Moses. 

"The · Redactor wound all the vers ions 
together so expertly that it fooled everybody 
for 2000 years." 

Friedman's ExiLe and Biblical Natralivewill 
be published and available in three months.

Sydow. 102 minutes. A dark, 
disturbing, chilling film - moody, 
mysterious and uneven. A wandering 
magician comes bearing a bag of 
tricks that turn him from magician 
into savior, then to con-man, and 
finally to artist extraordinaire. A 
brilliant attack on modern rationality 
and cynicism.

-. 

37 units in 
one quarter 
continued from page 1 
math courses, one philosophy 
course and an extension 
course en bu~inesg finance. 

Summer quarter, Nguyen 
outdid himself. Determined 
to increase his workload, he 
enrolled in summer sessions 
at both UCSD and San Diego 
State for a total of 38 units -
11 here and 27 at State. 

Nguyen admits that the 
first time he took more than 
30 units in one quarter "there 
was a lot of stress involved." 

"It was the first time that I 
was experiencing a lot of 
units, to the point I said. 
'Hey, it's not worth it .' But 
after the quarter was gone 
and I had a couple of weeks, I 
was ready to do it again." 

In order to keep up with his 
course work, Nguyen attends 
most classes. turns in all 
assignments on time and 
never takes an incomplete. 
He long ago gave up the idea 
of taking notes in class. 

"I listen carefully to what 
the professors say and think 
about it," Nguyen explains. 
"You think 10 or 20 times as 
fast as one can talk, so while 
he's talking I'm thinking 
about a problem and giving 
myself examples_ 

"When I go home I 
remember most of his stuff.If 
I read a -textbook. and the 
textbook is giving some 
parallel example. then I pick 
it up fast." 

To fit such a large number 
of courses into each quarter 
and to fulfill college, 
university and major 
requirements, Nguyen 
carefully plans each 

. quarter's schedule far in 
advance. 

"I was so lucky that the 
schedule of classes fit into 
what I wanted to do," he 
says. "No one will ever be 
that lucky again. I don't 
think anyone else will be able 
to do it.' 

Indeed, it appears that no 
UCSD student who has 
begun here as a freshman has 
graduated within two years. 

College provosts, academic 
advisors and administrators 
cannot recall any UCSD 
students who have sped 
through college so quickly. In 
fact, statistics show that a 
slight majority of UCSD 
students prefer the five-year 
plan. 

For example, at Third 
College, approximately 40 
percent of last year's 
graduating seniors took 
courses at UCSD for five 
years. The remaining 60 
percent took from three to six 
years. 

Warren, Muir and Revelle 
colleges cite similar figures, 
and administrators there say 
Nguyen's case is highly 

. unusual." 
However. it is not 

uncommon for students to 
take 20 or 24 units in one 
quarter with special 
permission from the 
provost's office, they say. 

Nguyen says he has had no 
difficulty receiving permis-
sion for the extra units. and 
says the Warren College 
requirements fit into his 
academic scheme "per· 
fectly. " 

In fact, the entire UCSD 
system seems to have fit into 
his plans . 

"The quality of teaching 
here is really good," Nguyen 
ays. "It somehow fits 

perfectly for foreign students 
because the tests are not 
being given in the form that 
you have to usc concise 

En~lish language to do it. 
'But if you have an idea 

how to do it, if you have a 
I~cal idea on how to do that 
thmg, you could represent 
exams in a way that the 
professors could understand 
it, " he explains. 

(Nguyen says that his 
UCSD lower division 
cour.ses have been at the 
level of SDSU graduate 
courses.) 

Undoubtedly one of the 
most frequently asked 
questions Nguyen is asked is: 
why? 

Nguyen admits that a 
major incentive to rush 
though college is financial. 
But more importantly, he 
says, graduating in two rears 
makes him "feel good' and 
will allow him to enter 
graduate school early. 

"I feel good I'm doing it in 
two years." he says. "I never 
had anything before; I never 
had any awards or anything, 
and it makes me feel good 
that I can achieve some-
thing_Of 

Because of the time 
strictures he has faced , 
Nguyeti says he has had to 
sacrifice creativity for time. 

"There's a little trade-off 
there," he admits. "Basically 
what I am doing here is 
trying to learn as much as I 
can ... You could do some 
creative things in under-
graduate school if you 
thought long enough. But I 
think if I am an undergra-
duate I do not have all the 
pieces of information. 

"You don't have all the 
advanced work that you have 
in graduate (school); you 
don't have all the tools and 
techniques to use," he says. 

So Nguyen took three 
graduate courses in econo-
mics last quarter. Although 
he says he doesn't regret the 
extra work, the courses led to 
what he says was probably 
his "only mistake' : below 
average grades and academic 

. probation. 
Despite the low grades, his 

GPA remains above average 
at 3.2 and he says he gained a 
jump over other graduates 
who plan to attend graduate 
school. 

Nguyen hopes to do his 
graduate work in economics 
at UCSD. "I will spend much 
more time in graduate school 
than in undergraduate 
(school) - maybe five or six 
years." he says. "I want not 
only to be learning. but to be 
more creative, take my time 
and think about other 
problems." 

His long-term goals include 
a PhD in economics, a 
consultant position with the 
federal government and later 
a university professorship. 

In the meantime, Nguyen 
has 24 units this quarter and 
20 units to complete in his 
final quarter before gradua· 
ting in June. By now he has 
evaluated his endeavors and 
their consequences, and says 
they have been worthwhile. 
But would he recommend it 
to other undergraduates? 

"I would say, 'Why not?' if 
one could do it. but I wouldn 't 
push anyone to do it," 
Nguyen muses.

Grade 
Appeals 

~ can you do about 
grades you are not happy with? 
The most effective means is to 
talk to yQ4S professor about it If 
'you simply disagree with yoUr 
. professor about the quality of 
your \'\IOfk - you sa a C and 
think you deserve an A - it is 
difficult to substitute your 
judgemert tel the professor'"s 
and get the higMr !Jade. It, on 
the other hand, you have reason 
to betieYe that your professor 
was acting arbitrarily or 
maliciously by givire a low 
grade tel reasons not directly 
reflective of academic 
performance in the course, 
such as racism, sexism, a 
ideological bias, then you may 
ha\Ie a case. . 

Printed below are regulations 
tel the San Diego Division of the 
Academic Senate pertaining to 
grade appeals: 

1) The student may attempt 
to resolve the grievance with 
the instructor within the first 
month of the followire regular 
academic quarter. 

2) If the grievance is not 
resolved to the student's 
satisfaction, ~1sbe may then 
attempt to resolve the 
grievance through written 
appeal to the Department 
Chairman or equivalert, ' who 
shall attempt to adjudicate the 
case witb the instructor and the 
student within two weeks. 

3) If the grievance still is. not 
resolved to the student's 
Sc'!tisfaction, he/she may then 
attempt to ' resolve the 
grievance through written 
appeal to the Provost of his/her 
college, the Dean of Graduate 
Studies, or the Dean of the 
School of Medicine, who shall 
attempt to adjudicate the case 
with the instructor, the 
Chairmen and the student 
within two weeks. . 

4) If the grievance is not 
resolved to the student's 
satisfaction by the Provost or 
Dean, the student may request 
consideration of his/her appeal 
by the CEP (Committee on 
Education Policy) Subcommit-
tee on Grade Appeals. This 
request must be submitted 
before the last day of 
instruction of the quarter 
following the quarter in which 
the course was taken. 

The CEP Subcommittee on 
Grade Appeals is required to 
follow procedures established 
by the Academic Senate. A

history of the national student 
advocacy movement, UCSD has 
established a direct link with 
this movement's leading force; 
the United States Student 
Association (USSA). At the 
National Student Congress held 
in Eugene, Oregon last .August, 
UCSD's own Lee Anderson was 
elected to the National Board of 
Directors of LISSA. Lee is nO\N 
back at UCSD after a fall quarter 
absence and receives 
interesting mail from around the 
cOuntry. 

The Reagan adm,inistration 
and the fiscally conservative 
Republican Senate has outlined 
in ' no uncertain terms a grim 
scenario fex exi~ting Student 
Affirmative Action, Financial 
Aid programs and many social 
issues with direct and indirect 
impact on students. The role of 
a politically relevant lobbying 
baSe for student concerns and 
socially related legislation is 
particularly vital in these 
troubled transitional times to 
gently remind governmental 
officials who their constituen-
cies are. The LISSA is gearing up 
fa a spirited battle with the 
new order in order to salvage 
the sinking ship of egalitarian 
educational ethics. 

Although Lee cc:rrepresents 
the whole state, logistics 
necessitate a singular base. This 
base is the ASUCSD offlces.on 
Tuesdays and Thursdays from 1-
2:30. Come-by and find out the 
latest news and more 
importantly, give him a piece of 
your mind.
