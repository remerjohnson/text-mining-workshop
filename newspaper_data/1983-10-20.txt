Some of the criticism of this year's student council has dealt with the rel.ttive 
inexpenence of the AS members as a whole . The Guardiall posed the problem to 
AS Activit)' Fee Commissioner Erik Roede .... 

"I think that Ithe accusation of inexperience I is probabl)' \'alid if you arc 
counting the number of years' experience people have had j in student 
governmentj : Roedl' said . "and chances are the), have nOl had that man)'. 
However, it's generally agreed, at leaS{ among the administration people whom 
we work with closely, that it is a very tightly knit counCIl and quite an effective 
council. The Adminiscmtion feel, we are gelling things done m a much more 
organi zed fashion than has been done previou~I)'." ... 

When asked if rhl' fal'!that AS President CrJlg Lee was ofanO(her paJty (Lee for 
Me) in the spring elections made fur :111)' hard leelings ,lr dillicuities on tht, 
council , Roede firmly stated thdt there IS n,JI now nur W.lS there ever any 
an IlTIOSI t)' between Lee and any I11cmbcrs 01 lhe Tuppcn\'arc Pail)" mostl) 
beca use Lee and the Tuppe/Ware candid,ltc . Gclgl'r. wcre nO( that dinerem In 
their views on the Issues .... 

Roedt' oversees the allocation of $00.000 (ll'r ycar In AS fund s to !>tudent 
orgal1l zations (150 In aU, of which ,Ibout hall request ActiVIt)' fund~). With rhe 
assistance of six people he trims request s IhJt reach a quaner of a million dollars 
annually. In order to do this fairl)' , he must work III d ose cooper.Ition with the 
student organizations to see to It that the monel' IS spent on what he calls "the 
most effective" programs each organization has to offer. 

While others might handle programming funds for campUS-\\'lde events or 
operating expenses 10.r campus groups, Roedl' ,1I1dhis commiSSion give money 
for speakers for oJganlzalions, club acm'Il)' lunus, etc. The campus ncwspapers. 
including the Koala, are conSidered medl.\. Places like the Gener,11 Store . Ihe food 
Co-op and KSDT are conSidered under a separate pan llf the presldcnt's budgct 
as "sludent-run sclVices" and do not hili under Roedc's jurbdIUlon ....

The AS funding question: Will the 
needs of the student body be fully_ met? 

It is no secret that the primary duty or the Associated Students 
is ro allocate student mon ies among special interest groups. This 
week the AS i holding its budget hearing to decide ro what 
extent to fund UC D's student organizations. 

There is always a great deal of controversy surrounding 
decisions made by our elected representatives, As with any 
government's budget, certain cuts must be made to utilize funds to 
their maximum potential while keeping within the priorities of the 
CUJTent administration. These decisions always make a lot of 
people unhappy and a few people incredibly miserable. 

It will be very interesting [0 see what decisions the budget 
committee will come to , As Dexter Linn , a noted scholar of 
economics, says, "Tansta{1" (There ain 't no such thing as a free 
lunch), 

The AS must strive [0 gear its policies ro benefit the greatest 
portion of the stude nt population. Each year the Committee for 
World Democracy, a political film soc iety. is funded to present 
films tha t neither bring fin:lIlcial return to the AS (although thcre is 
rumor thar a 50 cent admission \vill be in rated in order to co\'cr 
cost~) nor serve a large grouping uf undergraduate students. A 
converse example would be the AS underwriting a student 
organi::a(lon to present a popular fiim . De::,plt(.' rhe man} 
organJ2cltinns that h<.1\·c conduc!l'u prolitahk fund raising there IS 
nc \'cr cntlugh mone), to go .lrnund 

\\'ho can t.lkc the hlame for th I 'i lal k nl funus? ~IC C,lll not pbcc 
all of the bbl1le on the AS. Thcre :5 jusr so much to work with and 
11 dne n't gn quitt.' so br a- \\'e ",am II to The root of the prnhkm 
IS in studem organlz.ltions \\'hose nudget demands exceed actu~d 
need lor the amount of student::, rllL'y scrve. 

On any Friday night one can cross the hump in front of the 
Gym heading towards Revdie Plaza finally endIng up by U B 2722 
and find rhe venue in which the political film series is sho\'..'O. You 
will also find a very sparee crowd. con idering the amount of 
money th~l[ is being nushed into maimaining C'vVD. 

We ca nnOt go on supporting org,lll izaions thar do not se ryc the 
Interests of thl' Clmpus. AS President Craig Lee has made many 
moti ons towards curring off the gangrenous limbs of our srudent 
organizations. It is a wonde rful thing to go to conventions ail about 
Californ ia. but why sh()uld the studellts foot the bill? The t\.iouel 
U nited atl(~n s has made efforts tl' aile\'iare thc burden on the AS 
by rai 'ing money In alternative meclia to pay for their actIvities, 
while other student organizations leel that AS funding is their 
"right. " 

It is a good thing to become involved in student affairs, but too 
many organizations' motives do not really coincide with those of 
UCSD's .. (udent body as a whole. It is not impossible for students 
to run an organization in a stable business-like manner so that 
they won't n~ed funding from the AS year after year. 

Perhaps it the only funds available from the AS for student 
organizations came in the form of underwrites, there would not 
only be more money going towarcJs wOlThwhile (in the sense of 
student priorities) programming, there would be more funds for 
the AS to deal with pertinent srucJenr issues. 

We cannm sit by idly while a sciec.r few take thei r personal 
mandates lalld the four signatur;?s thilt it takes to become J 
student organization) and squander money that has been set aSIde 
for the use of the entjr~ student body.

Grade Appeals: A journey through 
labyrinth of UCSD 's judicial system 
By MICHAEL S. GOODHEIM 

In recent years, state politicians have 
tried to win a law school for UCSD, 
without avail. But even without such a 
school, there is a judicial system on our 
campus, likely unparalleled In the 
academic world. This is the grade 
appeals system and you. can read 
chapter and verse from its rules and 
regulations in your handy General 
Cara/ogue. 

This is jl,lst a preliminary to the real 
hean of our appeDate system, the 
Academic Senate. 

The Senate is an unbiased SCI of 
professors which includes the professor 
and depanmem chair who turned down 
your appeal before. But you may not 
have 10 deal with them unless they are 
members of the CEP (Comminee on 
Educational Policy) or its subcomminee 
on grade appeals. These bodies more 
clearly resemble a judiCial review system. 
However. let us think about what 

~md the gmy in your hilir sets you apall 
from the crowd . 

Indeed, the system is far from fast . 
Due process and speedy trial clauses are 
spelled out in the C(/Ial.,~:u.: . but the 
Senate is not bound by these clauses, 
and no one should expect to win by 
default. My case took nine months. 

Our appellate system is not immune 
from reform. Students do not have to 
agree with being graded on separate 
curves from their classmates. A student 
with 98% on a test does not have to 

recclve a B+ for his effon. Only one 
thmg l:an change the !\ystem, and that is 
usage. The only claim that cannot be 
made of our appellate system is that it is 
overburdened. But that can change. 
Appeals will only becom~ viable tools for 
the student when the grade tS viewed 
seriously by aU . 

The appellate system is much like 
your front door. If it is not oiled and 
used regularly, it sticks, squeaks and 
becomes downright obstinate. So plea~ 
oil your professor regularly. 

It is the pinnacle of twentieth century 
educational reform in the area of 
Stlftlknts' rights. The system's very 
exis~nce should put UCSD on the map 
of modem universities in the world . 
You're probably asking yourself why you 
haven't heard of this paradigmic regime . 
Well, one of the greateSt virtues of the 
system IS that it is nor made to be used. 
ThiS appellate system is, rherefore , the 
best guarded sccrcr on campus, ro both 
faculty and studcnts. 

aspects are reaDy essential to a judicial 
system. The first thing which comes 10 
mind IS a lawyer Our system is no 
different from any other. The mention 
of the proVOSt as an arbnrator m the 
appellate system tS actually an 
admiSSion that 'thiS 5011 is unsull,lble for 
the layman ' One suggestion given to me 
was 10 wmact the commiSSioner of 
student welfare of the AS. Cmai nl )' the 
rule filr "dt1lIll.1nce to an)' viable Ieg.ll 
system IS to hill'!' an inordinate number 
01 counsels. And so. our aprll.He systcm 
h,lS qualilied ItSl'lf for orTiciJI \'i,lh llit} 

Is bigger better? 
I was one of the foolish ones who 

thought that the systcm was In working 
condition . I have had seven ocea!:>ions 
ro u~e the appellate S)'Mem, Ilndlng Il 
more .lIld more interesting each time. 
But )'Ou have to go through the whole 
sy~tem 10 realize its built-In mechanisms 
lor futility . 

We all know that , at one time or 
,lIlother, students are dissatisfied wuh a 
r. n.ll grade. So where do rhey turn but 
01' Professor So-And-So. Well, rhis step , 
unbeknownst to most students, is the 
!"irst In the appellate system. The 
professor must review your grade; TAs 
don't count. If Professor So-And-So 
dendI'S to change the grade, he must fill 
out a clerical error form . The very name 
of thiS fonn suggests that professors are 
never wrong - It is their clerks with 
which we have to contend. 

This is usually as far as appeals go 
Sometimes provosts are thrown into a 
dispute as intermediaries, but the 
Juclicial s)'stem usually consists 01 
dclend,mt (the student), and Judge and 
jury (in rhe person of the professor). 
But, for those prinCipled souls who wlim 
a second Opinion . the d<:p,mmem chair 
IS alwars reddy to gl\'c a h<:lping hand 
- 'and concur with hb Icllow colleague. 

Oncc the dcclslon IS made to enter 
our "couns." "II hets Me 011. The Senatc 
has e"plicnl), <;ct the types of cases the), 
will con ider. These e,lses' are based on 
'non -academic criteria: and II'ho else IS 
competelll 10 decide such cases but an 
AcademiC cnatc? "Non-acadet1llc

directly renectivc of academIC

),our pro lessor blatantly discriminates 
against you on traditional grounds (sex. 
religion. race , etc.), then the comlttees 
in power Will give you a hearing.

in this system.

UCSD Medical Center to become one of 
the world's two joint transplant centers 

A joim transplantation program being 
instituted by the Universiry of 
California, San Diego Medical Center 
will make San Diego one of [WO 
locations in the world where such a 
procedure presently is available. The 
other is Toromo, Canada. 

The progr.lm involves obtaining 
cartilage and bone from the donor 
within 12 hours of death , then shaping 
and inserting it imo the knee or hip (or 
other joint) of the recipient. AI. present 

to be similar in architecture and size to 
the recipient 'S bone. To assure 
continuing elasticity of the cartilage, 
joints of individuals under 40 only are 
used . Donors must have been free of 
metabolic and venereal diseases, 
hepatitis, and cancer. 

The deadline for transplantation is 72 
hours at present but continued research 
may show this time frame can be 
extended, Meyers indicated. 

A continuing problem of artificial 
joint replacements is the eventual 
breakup of the. surgical cement binding, 

which loosens thc jOinr. An advantage of 
transplantation is that it does not 
require cememing. When the graft -
consisting of a shell of canilage over a 
thin layer of bone - is put in place, it 
is held by the pressure of the patient's 
own bones until d;>nor and recipient 
tissues integrate. fining the graft 
necessitates minimal destruction of the 
patient's bone tissue, 

Rejection has not bun a problem 
thus far and immunosuppressive drugs 
are not necessary. Patients appear to be 
free of pain, Meyers said, and have 

unlimited motion. 
The orth~ic surgmn regards the 

procedure as one that can buy time -
10, 15, or 20 )'tars of good joint ust for 
the patient. 

Restricted to knees and hips lit 
present, the ttthniquc could e\~ntualy 
be used with anldes, 6ngas, and other 
joints, Me)'Crs srated. Transplantation is 
not feasible in the casr of joilllS affected 
by rheumatoid arthritis sin« the same 
condition that dtslro)'ltd the patient'S 
own cartilage probably also wou\d 
destroy donor cartilage. 

"four patients are waiting for the proper 
donor joint to become available, 
according to Dr. Marvin H. Meyers, who, 
along with Dr. Allen E. Gross, of Mt 
Sinai Hospital, Toronto, has developed 
the procedure. 

Meyers has joined UCSD MedIcal 
Center's Division of Orthopedics and 
Rehabilitation afler performmg some 63 
jOlnl transplantations at the Umverslty 
of Texas Health Sciences Center, Dallas. 
(The Dallas program currently IS 111 
abcr<lnce.) Wllh patients to date being 
followed ~ o eight years , the JOlms have 
continued to function successfully, in 80 
percent of the cases, Meyers reports. 

Convery wins plastic joint grant 

The transplant is deSIgned primarily 
for younger indiVIduals whose greater 
physical activlry causc,; anificlal joint 
replacements 10 loosen in comparatively 
shoner periods of time. 

JOint transplants do not require tissue 
typing, as kidney transplants do, Meyers 
explained . However, the donor joint has 

Joint replac~ments which enable 
arthnllcs to regain their mobility are 
plagued by ev~ntual looseni ng of the 
cement which binds the artificial metal 
and plaslIc replacements to the patient'S 
bone tissue . A material which would 
adhere and hold its hardness 
indefinitcly has been the dream of 
onhopedic surgeons and their patients 
for a long IIm~. 

Now Dr. F. Richard Convery. 
professor of surgery and a speCIalist in 
reconstructive orthopedics at the

Landlords just can't figure why anyone 
would buy when they can rent. After all, 
owning a home is a big responsibility that 
students can't possibly handle . Your life would 
become undisciplined and chaoric without the 
landlord 's rules lO live by . Your damage deposit 
wouldn't be there waiting for you (without interest, 
minus deductions) when you leave . Speaking of 
leaving, when you rent you're free to pick up 
and leave. anytime the whim strikes you (or 
your landlord) . And how aboul the fun of 
lislening to your neighbors thru those thin 
walls - on a good night you don't even 
need a stereo for entertainment. All in 
all, renting is bener than bu}'ing (from the 
landlord 's point of view). It 's the natural 
order of things . Without renters like you , how 
would landlords be able to buy (heir buildings? 

grant of $235 ,000 over a three·year 
period to invesligate the possibility of 
adapting Industrial polymerization 
techniques to achieve a long-lasting 
plastic cemenl for use in knee 
replacemenrs. The program is !lnanced 
by the Rehabilitation Engineering 
Research and Development $ection of 
the Veterans Administmtion. 

Refining an idea first conceived by 
Convery five years ago. the research 
program will involve high pressure 
techniques, in much the same manner 
that high temper.Hures and pressure are 
used to produce plastics like lucite and 

plexiglass for commercial use. 
If the program succeeds in producing 

the desired cement characteristics, it 
also will be usable in replacement of 
other joints such as hips and ankles, 
Convery Indicated. 

The study will not emplo)' human 
patients in trying OUI the new materials. 
However, a knee joint constructed for 
dogs will be- placed in clinical trials 
during the course of the studr since 
canines also suffer anhritis 0 the knee. 
Dog hips and knees are similar to 
human joints in construction and 
movement, Convery explains.

New u(luanum-museum planned If''' 1988 

Scripps celebrates 
80th year 
By GRACE NIELSEN 

5 ~Tipps Institute (,I' (Xeanogrolphy, one of thl' largest. oldest and most important centers lor marine research IInywhere, is celebrating its 
80rh anniversary this )'tar. 

What W~ koow today as Slripps Institu,e 01 
Oceanograph,' ~n:w out of we interest ,>nd ~:fOT!5 "I a sma. group of San Diegans who formed the Marine 
Biolulical Association of San DieRo in 1903. Amonlt 
the I15t mC'meers were Elle ... Br"wning s.·npp. ,1Ild her 
brolher, E,W Scripps. in whose honl~r th~ lnstilluc 
was latrr named. The purpose of this association was 
to study the waltr surrounding San Diego and the 
animals and plants thar lived in this environment. 

In those earty yeats, the research and work of the 
group was done in Coronado. In 1905, the association 
opened ,what they caIcd the "litde green lab" in the La 
jolla ~ area. The 24 by 60 foot building housed a 
library, \aborarory, public aquarium and museum. aD of 
which were buik and instaDcd for a cost of S992. 

Within a short time, the association decided a larger 
facility was needed. It was then that E.W . Scripps 
pointed out thar there was \and available along what is 
known today as T~y Pines Road (where, he 
believed, no one would ever want to live). He 
~ that the group nCWJtiate with the Ciry of San 
Diqp, which hrld tide to the land, to purchase the 
locarion. So in 1907, at a public auction where the 
only bid received was from the association, the 1 H 
acre sitr was purchased lOr the bargain-basement price 
of 51000. The group now had an ideal site for their 
work, and the building of a new facility began. 

In 1912 the nrw station became pan of the UC 
system,311d it has bttn a research center and graduate 
school of lJC since that time. The campus, which was 
officialy named Scripps Institution of Oceanography in 
1925, now occupies 65 buildin~ and has an annual 
budget in the neighborhood of S68 miUion. Most of 
the finandng ror the Institute cOllies from the: fl'lkml 
government in thC' fonn of research COnlraClS alld 
granlS. 

There are currently over 250 research projects being 
conducted within the Marine Biology Division, the 
Geological Research Division and the Ocean Research 
Division. Those investigations include eanhquake 
prediction, beach erosion and studies of waves and 
currents. 

In addition to several specialized laboratories on the 
campus, Scripps operates four ships and two platforms 
for research on location around the world. S<:ientific 
research teams have made expeditions to the 
Galapagos Islands and Antarctica and numerous trips 
along the coasts of Cahfornia and Mexico. The 
research platforms known as FUP and ORB are used 
mainly for studies in the San Diego area. 

Scripps has an academic staff made up of 80 
professors and more than 100 research scientists. 
There are currently about 190 enrolled graduate 
students. 

Along with rl"search. the eJucatil1n of tho: publi~ is 
.lOother imponant function of the Instltutc. This role 
is fulfiDed mainly through the programs of the 
aquarium and museum. According to Aquarium 
Director Donald Wilkie, 295,000 people clicked 
through the turnstile at the aquarium last year. That, 
says Wilkie , was the third highest anendance record 
for a public museum in San Diego. 

Many of the aquarium's educational prosrams are 
designed for school children. Those of us who grew up 
in San Diego will remember the annual field trips to 
Scripps during elementary school. 

The aquarium , which was built in 1951 , has on 
exhibit many fascinating animals from the waters of 
California, Mexico and the Sea of Conez. The museum 
contains displays on the current studies In marine 
biology and reSC'arch be-ing done at Scripps. 
Maintenance of the aquarium-museum is done by the 
sralT and volunteers that include ten UCSD work-study 
students. Public involvemem is solicited through the 
Scripps Aquarium Associates, who participate in the 

, many coDecting trips made to catch the more than 

6000 specimens needed annually for aquanum displays 
and research. Several of the collecting expeditions have 
been made in conjunction with the Universiry of Baja 
California in La Paz. 

One imponam function of the aquarium-museum, 
says Wilkie , is irs role as a major contact for UCSD 
with the public . Acording to Wilkie, "Scripps has a 
tremendous credibiliry with the public, and in our 
surveys it's very clear people aren't coming here simply 
to sec another aquarium or another mu~um. thl'v'TI' 
c"ming h.:re to gel a better understanding of the 
Institute, the resc:m:h that goes on in the 
institution ... and, in many cases, to understand how the 
scientists at Scripps interpret the evenrs that alTect the 
ocean: 

There are plans on the drawing board now for a 
new aquarium-museum. Ideally, the new building will 
be 30,000 square feet; that would make it three times 
the size of the present building. The proposed site for 
the faciliry is south of married student housing, 
be[Weeen the Oceanography Building at Scripps and 
the Mandell Weiss Center. Wilkie says this location 
would help integrate the UCSD campus with the 
Institution and make Scripps more accessible to U~SD 
students. Cosrs for the new building ar estimatd at $6 
million . The Universiry is currently working with 
Scripps on a plan 10 raise money for the project. 
Wilkie says he hopes 10 be in the new building by 
1988.

Deserted possessions 
on the auction block 
By PHIL WILLON 

Do you know where your calculator IS 
nght now? Well , you bener double 
check , because some elderly lady 111 
Chula VislU 111Ight be u~lOg your HP 33E 
to calculate her \\'eekly grocery bill. SIIK'e 
the annual UCSD found Jnd unclaimed 
propeny auction that was held last night 
in National City. 

According [Q Ralph Roblee. manager 
of th~ UCSD Equipment Office. whi h 
handles rhe event , most of the items 

4/I'ere ei ther left behind in rhe dorms 
when the students went home for the 
summer or left in the libraries and 
classrooms during the last school year. 

The University IS re9uired to hold 
items found for at least three months 
before they can dispose of them. but 
most items are kept for nearly a year, 
and if unck1imed they are auctioned off. 
"Those kids leave anything and 
everything," said Roblee while he was 
reviewing the invemory. Included in this 
abundant stockpile were three mopeds. 
a video recorder. 60 bicycles, television 
sets, car stereos. jewelry. watches. 
dozens of calculators and an assortment 
of text books. Some of the more unusual 
items were a pair of ice skates. a 
clarinet, a tire . a full set of dining room 
chairs. five pesos .lI1d three Canadian 
pennies. 

Throughout the year all of the lost 
Items make their way to the campus 
police station where they are held until 
something can be done with them. "If 
there IS any Idenllfication number we 

make every elTon tll get II back to ItS 
owner." s,lid propen)' clerk Richard 
Hudnall. "We don't W,lnt the d.unn 
thlOgs." 

Hudnall did acknowledge th.lt orne 
01 the more expensive Items might have 
been stolen and then l.ner abandoned 
when the school year ended , but he 
sa id rhar in most cases the stun was just 
left behind . He also added that many of 
the owners were contacted and told rhe 
whereabours of their propcny. Including 
rwo for rhe mopeds. but they just never 
borhered ro come by and pick it up. It's 
all gone now. 

Unfortunmely. those conSCientious 
CItizens who tumed the lost items will 
nor ger rh em back later. This is because 
any item found on campus is legally the 
University's property. Cash is different. 
If it is found and unclaimed for four 
months, then the fj nder gets to keep the 
money. 

The auction at UCSD is nor unique; 
most large colleges and universities have 
similar problems with lost and 
unclaimed propeny and hold auctions 
to dispose of it. UCSD used [0 have its 
own auction until it became [00 
expe nsive and time consuming to pUI 
on. Roblee said that the school found it 
could net more money if i[ let an 
outside auclion company handle it. 

Right now. the University is looking 
to make between $1.500 and $3,000 
from the event, all of which will be put 
into the UCSD general operating

The Iceman Traineth 

UCSD's Adams: Putting pain on ice 
By ~RISTOPHER CANOLE 

The freshman intramural footbaU wide 
receiver floated in mid-air. Agghhh. This 
was not the cry of victory. Just as the 
ball reached his fingertips his thigh was 
being assaulted by a defender's 
shoulder. The pain wave screamed 
through his body. Teammates carried 
the writhing student off the field , being 
careful nOl to touch the swelling thigh . 
An older athlete ordered them 10 "taKe 
him to the Ic.:man ." 

The minds of unknowing spectators 
and players visualized the receiver being 
escorted Into the icy cold clutches of an 
ogre breathing frozen fog What fate is 
this for one in agony? 

------------~----~--

Those who have become followers of 
the Iceman knowingly smile at the 
paradox of his name. His soft yet 
~rful touch has massaged away the 
pain from thousands of UCSD students' 
muscles. And the knowledge given by 
his SOOlhing voice instills confidence in

iceman title. Rhys Danylyshyn-Adams, _ 
the UCSD athletic trainer, is the iceman. 

The popularity and success of his 
icing techniques create some problems. 
Rhys says, "The ice machine is breaking 
down. We are using it so much we are 
runnmg out of ice aU the time and 
having to go around borrowing more 
ice." Rhys is also in need of an 
experienced trainer 10 help spread the 
word of ICE. 

The Writing on the waU of the 
training room gives a brief idea of what 
ICE (ice compression elevation), is all 
about. "ice (1) stimulates circulation. 
which (2) reduces pain, (3) reduces 
muscle spasm, (4) reduces fatigue 
during exercise (a cool muscle functions 
betrer than an overheated muscle), and 
(5) ice hurts like hell'" Rhys' humor is 
part of his easy style. But although he is 
easygoing. he is expertly lrained and 
quick to hand out litemture from SpOrts 
Iherapists lhroughout the world . 
explaining whr ice is so successh.l. 

The use of icc in treating athletic 

i~es i~ not an innovation. 
Knowledgeable coaches, trainers and 
physicians have been stressing the 
application of "ice, ice, and more ice" 
for many years, especiaUy in first aid 
care. 

However, ice trealment (cryotherapy) 
has become an increasingly versatile 
method of therapy in recent years by 
also serving as an importam component 
of successful rehab/liration programs. 
Although icc may be the cheapest , safest 
and most frequently used technique in 
sports medicine, it is importam to know 
what speci fie effects ice has on the 
body. when and how to use it and how 
it helps in the rehabiliration process. 

Before one can understand how ice 
affects an injury, one must understand 
the body's response to tmuma. Whether 
an Injury is due to a direct blow or to 
stretching or tearing of tissue, there will 
be damage to the blood vessels , 
symphatic vessels or capillaries in the 
injured area, which results In an 
effusion of blood and lymph into the

outer tissues. The collection of blood 
and debns (waste products) outside the 
damaged vessels leads to the swelling 
that is associated with injuries. 

The body responds to the primary 
injury by constricting the blood vessels 
in the 1n1\lred area . thereby slowing 
blo,xl Illlw 10 that area and reducing the 
amount III ox)'gen coming in. Both the 
blotxl \l'ssel constriction and the 
swelling ,Ire attempts by the body to 
reduce hemorrhage . 

A secondary injury occurs as the 
result of the decreased now of blood 
and oxygen 10 the injured area. Cells 
that survived the Initial trauma now die 
bet:ilUse of the lack of oxygen. This in 
tum increases the amount of waste 
material in the area and adds to the 
swelling. An ilthlere's recover)' time will bl! 
affected by the extt'nt of this swelling 
and the speed with which thc body 
reduces it . 

As a first aid measure. the applicatitln 
of cold (often In thc fonn of ice) to the 
injury helps Icssen the d,lmagc done to 

tissue and ncrves. Ice aids in superficial 
constriction of the blood vessels and 
helps reduce the effusion of blood and

of UCSD Theatre Public Relations. 

Beginning last Friday and continuing 
through October 28, ten drama majors 
are interviewing students around 
campus on their theater-going habits at 
UCSD. 

Developed by Ernie Linares, a San 
Diego State business intern specializing 
in marketing research, the study covers 
all areas of students' exposure 10 UCSD

Running Thoughts

WHAT'S GOING ON HERE DEPT. In 1,lst week's .:olumn, W~ suggeslcd th,lt the 
Intercolleglatc Athletic Departml'nt Is nm spend ing ItS .Idvl'rtising wiscly. Tt) elaborate 
we would like to otTer some ideas that would bolster anend,lnce and thus, crcme more 
revenues for intercollegiate teams. First. hire someone In pass out nyers the Jay before , 
and the day of the game. Five hundred flyers would COst approximately $5 and II'lluld 
take an hour or twO to pass OUI. If sol11eone is making $4.16 an hour, the IA olrlce 
would have to sheU out roughly $9 for each event it wants to promme. Because 
volleybaU and basketball are the only two Sports that charge admission, the costs would 
not be that great. ·We don't have the money to do that right now," silys Jud), Malnnc,

organiza tions which put on movies and campus events. To this Malone adds. "The 
problem with placing cards in the cafs is that 50 many org.lnizmion5 plal'C them Ihere 
each day th.1t there would be three cards on CWI)' t,lble ." One clluld sUrimsc Ihat aU 
the IA department would have to do IS coordinJte Ihe times .lnd dates with the other 

organi~ons so thaI the tables arc free for them solely, but Malone docsn 't think thiS 
pOSSibility is likely. We would like 10 snlle that the IA office has made great strides In 
thc past lew )'e<lrs, but this is nOl a time to be complacent. The depanment should 
capilalize on their good fonune by reaching out 10 the student body and promming 
their events in a more successful manner.

LA Dep-artrl1ent should revamp- its attitude towards p-ublicilY-

oftentimes standing) through three and one hJlf hours of Monday night's gJl11e 
between the Washington Rcdskins and the Green 6.IY Packers. Going in to Ihe contest 
we knew that With Washington's "true pro" offense ,lIld their hornd defensive unit 
(how did they ('vcr Win the Super Bowl?). and Green Bay's explOSive offense and swiss 
cheese defense , Ihar the scoreboard would be ringing up like a pinbaU machine. But 
little did we know that the SkinS would score on nearly ~vel)' offensivc play and that 
the Pack would S<.'ore more times than they had the ball (well , it seemed that way 
anyway) to set a record for the 1983 season and a career Monday night football record 
for the most pOlnrs scored in a g.lme. Final St:ore; Green Bay 48, Washington 47. 
Although it was cenalnly eXCiting, let's hope Ih'lI Don COl)'ell's philosophy Ih.\[ a 
defense IS on [he field only to give Ihe oITense a rest hasn 't carried over 10 other NFL 
teams. Defense IS stili the ricket to a Super Bowl vi.:lOry. 

NEXT QUESTION PLEASE DEPT. Monday's question: Who is the relired mhlcte who 
has earned Ihe most money in s(>Orts7 Muhammed Ali . Today's question: The medicine 
ball has Ihe slowest speed in sports. Which lour SPOrtS have the Jas/Ls/ ball speed? 
COULD IT BE DEPT. As the UCSD Intercollegiate Department continues 10 expand at 
an incredible ralc : the school's alumni has staned <I CI)' for the only Important thing 
missing from this school: a football team. Appareml), the alumni is more seriOUS [han 
[he IA Dep,mment reponed last week during ,l press conference. The IA c\allns 
[hat alumni effons were only in the preliminary development,,1 stage and have (;II,en 
shon of accurate estimation. According to G'I<In//(1/I ~our(es. a group headed by fonner 
Olympic star Eric Heiden. who attended UCSLJ for two years, has volunteered ro 
appropnate $67.5 million to engincer the conslructlon of a football stadium 10 be built 
near Muir field and handle all Ihe neccssal)' expenses to field a UCSD foOl ball tcam by 
the 84-85 season. If plans follow true 10 form , college football will soon have [he Pac 
11. The only obstacle remuining IS the approval b>' the IA Department.

Bob's Book Report 

The master of bad taste 
Iy ROBERT 1E0ftf 

f.dward St. John Gorey has penned some of the Il1Cl5t horrifying 
works In the DlglIsh language. His art. whkh Is a synthesis of writing 
and drawing. has just enough lightness to relieve the sensations of 
fear. horror. and doom that he plants In his work. 

While ~. Oorey has never to my knowledge been associated with 
UCSD In a substantial way. Cluster Ubrary. Central Ubrary (general 
stacks and Special Collections). and the famed Cluster Playback 
Center have examples of his works. which are Ideal literature for 
Humanities students who have finished either the reading assignment 
or the paper that was due seven hours earlier. 

The Unstrung Ita",. or Ifr. r..rlM.s.s Writes I ffouel. Mr. Gorey's most 
personable and first published work. which Is the first story In the 
.4mph;go~y anthology. Is the story most amenable to such readers. 
since It deals with writing and rewriting. Another work of note In the 
same anthology. The GashlgelVmb nnies. Is a series of abed poems. 
each stanza referring to two children who met griSly ends. The poem Is 
particularly remarkable In that the names of the twenty-six deceased 
children form an alphabet. 

Gorey Is famed for his alphabets. whkh Include The OIinese 
Cklislts. a story In the anthology Amphigorey Too. He Is also known 
for h\.s long and consistent attellClana at the new York Ballet. 
covering decades. This background Is used In his story The Cillded &t. 
which Is about the life of a fictional ballerina. 

for those of you who will not be able to read or see (and <icfty's 
drawings are half the joy of reading his works) after you finish your 
papers. Cluster Playback hasa tapeofsome of Gorey's writings read by 
Tammy ~mes and occasionally set to mustc.

Ed Ifarkins is 
making the 
world take note 
of (TIIE)'s style. 

By Am ROBI"SO" 
Trumpet pla~r [d Harkins' 

career epitomizes that of the 
UCSD professor. Uke many 
professors Harkins has, largely 
focused his creative energies on 
experiment. His work has 
typically been on the forefront 
of his field. His expertise Is In 
music, particularly new music 
- contemporary music. He has 
established International 
renown within new music 
circles through his perfor-
mances In (THE), a duo, with 
singer Philip Larsen. Harkins' 
style and background has 
developed parallel to advances 
In music experiment. 

Harkins' college education 
began with someth Ing of a false 
start at the University of 
Colorado, Boulder. He explains. 
"My father wanted me to be a 
business mcVor. but I flunked 
out. In fact. my transcript had 
seventeen hours of "f," and I 
had a "P" In handball - pass. 
So it was very difficult for me to 
get back Into school at that 
point. Clearly I dldn·t want to be 
In btl'Slness." 

luckily, Harkins was 
admitted to illinois Wesleyan 
University by trumpet audition. 
Amongst his teachers there 
were Will Ogden and John 
Silber, who are currently on the 
music faculty here at UCSO -
contacts that would prove to be 
Significant In later years. 

Interest In experimental and 
contemporary music began for 
Harkins at Illinois Wesleyan. 
and he established a reputation 
as a new music performer. He 
continued his work on 
performance In graduate school 
at Yale. where he also became 
Involved In new music 
composition. 

At about this time. the 
Rockefeller foundation made 
generous grants to several 
universities to form centers that 
would develop and perform new 
music. A group called the 
Contemporary Chamber PIa~rs 
was started at the Unversity of 
O1lcago, 50 Harkins atldltloned 
and was accepted into this 
ensemble. He began work on his 
PhD in composition there but 
performed little. 

The following year Harkins 
moved on to join a group. newly 
formed by the Rockefeller 
Foundation, at the University of 
Iowa. There he completed his 
PhD while participating In the 
Center for !'few Music and 
continuing to perform classical 
music • 

After teaching for two years 
at the !'few England Conserva-
tory of Music In Boston. Harkins 
studied with famous trumpet 
teachers In !'few York City. The 
contacts he had made at illinois 
WeSleyan then proved their 
Importance. " I got a call from 
Roger Reynolds, who Is on the 
faculty here. And once aqaln. 

the Rockefeller foundation had 
put some money Into a new 
music - contemporary music 
project. It was originally called 
the Project for Music 
f.xperiment. In the second year 
it became what It is now, the 
Center for Music Experiment. .. 

In 1972 he was hired for an 
experimentally oriented 
fellowship, as opposed to the 
usual performance oriented 
ones. 

Harkins' first year at UCSO 
focused on trumpet experi-
ments. "The trumpet was built 
to do certain things. and It· oS 
Interesting to take a device like 
that and see what can be do~ 
with It. It's just Incredible. and 
that's just a nice context rot" 
creative things to happen. Given 
a very simple hunl.l of me~1 and 
one thing: what can you do with 
it? The diversity that's possible 
Is just absolutely Incredible." 

Unusual methods of playing 
Include putting the mouthpiece 
In the wrong place. making the 
trumpet sound muted without a 
mute. making a normal sound 
with mutes. putting slides In the 
wrong places. playing with a 
reed mouthpiece. and using a 
special setup which allows 
breath-activated access to a 
synthesizer. 

In his second year. he joined 
the r.xtended Vocal Techniques 
fnsemble "on a whim:' The 
ensemble was unique In the 
world. "It was the first organized 
attempt to deal with all that 
stuff (sonic possibilities of the 
voice). People had heard about 
unusual techniques existing In 
certain countries. that were 
traditional. like Mongolia or 
Tibet. But nobody really tried to 
duplicate or study them In any 
way. We ftnally got to the point 
where we were pretty good at 
doing them. and we invited 

composers to start writing 
pieces for us. In 1976 we did our 
first European tour. In 1977 we 
did our flrst really successful 
[uropean tour." 

(THE) had Its roots In the 
Extended Vocal Techniques 
Ensemble. Harkins and Larsen. 
In Improvising on a piece they 
would perform alone on the 
1977 tour, discovered a mutual 
creativity. "It became clear that 
the two of us had a lot In 
commOD that we dldn·t know 

about - all our likes and 
dislikes in terms of body 
movement. timing. things like 
that. We were all in sync. so what 
was suposed to be improvised 
we started composing. It got 
longer and longer and more 
involved. , Pretty soon it was 
almost a piece in itself:' 

Oddly enough, the piece had 
nothing to do with extended 
vocal techniques. but It was 
continued In the ensemble's 
program as "a change of pace." 

UCSD Professor Cd Harkins on (THf): 'We're classically trained 
musicians and what we do is a sort of personallheater. " 

The piece was both musical and 
theatrica I. 

Harkins and larsen began 
performing as the duo [THE) in 
1979. Their reputation quickly 
grew as they became more 
active and in demand at avant-
garde and new music festivals. 
Most recently they performed at 
the Music Today Festival In 
Tokyo. 

Reflecting on thf response in 
Tokyo, Harkins characterized 
the Japanese audience as 
reserved and interested from 
the Intellectual viewpoint. In 
contrast. American concerts 
often get out of control. since 
the audience. expecting humor, 
sometimes forces a serious 
piece to be funny. 

Characterizing (THE) is more 
difficult than describing its 
audience. Harkins seriously 
explains. "There Is more to 
(THE) thanjust humor, There's a 
kink. The Kink. You can make a 
fence analogy - funny or not 
funny. We're classically trained 
musicians. and what we do is a 
sort of personal theater." 

Currently Harkins' personal 
priority is his his research, and 
primarily his collaboration with 
Larsen. Playing with SOrtOR. 
UCSO's new mustc ensemble, 
teaching Music 2 and Music 5, "a 
course from another planet, .. as 
well as a graduate seminar In 
complex reading. consume his 
dally energies. 

On Wednesday. (THt) will 
perform "[tude for (THE)" as 
part of SOrtOR. Composed by 
Jojl Yuasa, the piece Is 
significant In that It Is only the 
second performance of the ftrst 
piece ever written for (THE) by 
someone other than Harkins or 
Larsen. Additionally (TH[) will 
perform In the "Exploration" 
series In los Angeles on 
November 10.

You know Harry. HOe's the guy 
who sticks the needle through 
his ann. 

Hany Anderson. maglclan-
huckster-comedian. has an 

./ interesting trick in which it 
appears he sticks an oversized 
needle through his arm. 
Actually. interesting Isn·t quite 
the word. Perhaps amazing. 
unbelievable. or even repulsive 
would be better. This "geek" 
stunt looks so real that ifyou're 
the least bit sensitive to that 
sort of thing. you'd best look 
away. Anderson inserts the 
needle. shoves it up and down 
through his ann. and as the 
audience moans in disgust at 
the dripping blood. he yells 
aRnoyedly. " Hey. it's just a 
trick!"' 

Harry Anderson's got something 
up his sleeve and in his arm 

Sometimes he's not sure how 
he does the tricks himself. He 
asks a volunteer for a flve-dollar 
bill. sets It on Hre ("Hey. It's 
gonel Got a twenty?" ), and then 
makes it reappear In a sealed 
box of cigarettes. Sometimes it 
doesn't work. Once. when a 
rather distressed gentleman 
found only cigarettes In the box 
and Inquired about his money. 
Anderson replied. " I burned It 
up. Didn't you see me?" 

However. there is much more 
to Anderson than just that 
unforgettable stunt The 31-
year-old performer has taken 
the swindling of the street con 

game and the mystery of stage 
magic and combined them into 
one of the funniest stand-up 
shows you'lI ever see. What 
makes Anderson shine is his 
delivery and his interplay with 
his audience. 

He initially comes off as a 0 
loser. wearing his 20s-style suit. 
old hat. and wire-rimmed 
glasses (no lenses). However. he 
Is anything but that He's the 
perfect streetwise swindler. the 
guy on the street comer running 
the shell game. raking in the 
cash from the unsuspecting 
businessmen and always 
looking over his shoulder for 
the cops. 

San Diego film r~t 
kicks off fifth year 

By Pli K[ Tn OI'IAS 
Alter a summer's giut of 

movies about horny 
teenagers. October is a 
cinematic harvest for the 
serious San Diego fUmgoer. 
the highlight being the Fifth 
Annual San Diego film 
festival (see story). 

A debt is owed to the 
Landmark Corporation, the 
Los Angeles cinema chain 
that runs such local theaters 
as the Ken. Guild, fine Arts. 
and Cove. With the demise of 
the much loved Unicorn 
Theatre in La Jolla a couple of 
years ago, an enormous 
vacuum was created for San 
Dlegans to view foreign and 
domestic films that would 
otherwise never be seen. 

The Llndmark chain has 
done an admirable job of 
filling that space with the 
Ken, the repertory house in 
Kensington that features a 
daily rotating schedule of 
classics and contemporary 
cinema. Upcoming events 

4 n~t"s October 20, 1983 

include the San Diego 
premieres of Emile de 
Antonio's political drama, In 
the King of Prussia. starring 
Martin Sheen; the acclaimed 
Australian film ~ of the 
Neuer Neuer. the remainder 
of the Preston Sturges 
retrospective : The Lady file 
and Nail the Conquering 
Nero tonight and Mad 
Wednesday and Miracle of 
!'forgan 's Creek on October 
27. 

Here on campus the UCSD 
International rllm Series 
continues with wc 8eraud 's 
Turtle on its lSackon Tuesday 
and Francesco Rossi's J 
Brothers on November 1. 

Looking ahead to 
November. one of the early 
treats will be the American 
premiere of The Unknown 
Chaplin at the Ll Jolla 
Museum of Contemporary Art 
on November 4, This 
screening of the 88C-1V 
documentary on the creative 

8y PIAU Dr: VOL 

And that description is not 
too far off the mark. Anderson 
grew up on the streets of Austin. 
New Orleans. and San francisco. 
hanging out with the gamblers 
and the Him-Ham men. At 16 he 
was operating his own shell 
game on the streets of San 
francisco until an Irate 
customer. a broken Jaw. and a 
few nights In jail turned him 
around. 

"There's got to be an easier 
way to make a living of this: ' he 
thought. so he turned the game 
Into an exhibition. a magic show 
of sorts. ending many of his 
stunts with a demonstration of 
how they were done and then 

passing the hat Soon he was 
performing on the lawns at 
colleges and then in the 
auditoriums. Nightclubs and 
Las Vegas engagements 
followed. Today he performs on 
such shows as s.turrIIM Night 
uue and Cheers. and In January 
he'll be getting his own 
television series. 

Some of his fellow magklans 
aren't too happy that Anderson 
shows the audience how his 
tricks are done. but that dldn·t 
stop him from being aw~ 
the Stage Magklan of the Year 
awanl by the National Acaderqy 
of Magklan Arts and Sciences In 
1981. 

last year Anderson appeared 
on campus as host of "An 
fvenlng of Comedy and Magic." 
This year the title of the show Is 
"Anderson's Illusions." It will 
star Anderson. his wife leslie. 
and Turk Pipkin. Showtlme is 
&pm Saturday In Mandeville 
Auditorium. Says Hany. "rrom 
the beginning I've been a liar 
and a cheat Show business 
seemed Inevitable." 

TIckets are $4.50 for students 
and are on sale at the box office.

UCSD's NoNames are trying to make a name for 
themselves by playing local clubs and even 

recording albums. (L to H) Hannes Kling, Reed 
. Pederson. Dave Desmaries and Chris Gessel. 

Thou shalt remain nameless 
By CORKY SRm[rIS 

(This is ".rt of a continuing 
Hiatus series of pto/fles on 
student ,nd local bands.) 

In addition to the technical 
and sclentlnc accomplish-
ments, history will accredit 
UCSD students with the 
discovery of "post morlent 
pop." It is revolutionary. 
exciting and spirited. It ls the 
sound of the norlames. and It Is 
here to stay. 

Chris Gessel. Reed Pederson 
and Hannes Kling. all UCSD 
students. plus bass player Dave 
Oesmaries. are the I'fonames. 
masters of jau InHuenced rock-
a-bllly. Pederson. the group's 
lyricist. says. "I always wanted 
to usejau (guitar) chords In our 
music." which had been 
predominantly rock-a-billy . 

Along with Kling's background 
In classical and jau plano. the 
I'Ioriames established this new 
energetic music whJch Gessel 
half Jokingly calls "postmortem 
pop." !ts enthuslastk dance-
appeal cures boring days and 
lifeless parties. 

Kling. a musk technology 
....... founded the group with 
SOIM San OIegulto High School 
friends. With only OM personnel 
change. the band has pla)'ld 
together for three and a half 
years. "Compatibility and the 
fact that we are friends outside 
of the band keeps us together:' 

After a beginning of high 
school dances and local clubs. 
the group Is succeeding on the 
"outside:' They play several Los 
Angeles clubs. Including Club 
88. and their first album. 
appropriately titled fnd of the 

Beginning, will be available 
soon. "Wc've already begun our 
second album." says Gessel. 

With a growing volume of 
high caliber originals. the group 
droDDed most of Its covers and 
will entertain UCSD October 29 
In the R£c Gym with their own 
songs. For this scheduled swim 
team benefit. the I'IoI'tames are 
bUIed with the 11WOIents. 

Pederson says. "Playing our 
own music Is more satisfying:' 
and satisfaction Is the group's 
motlvlltlon ... We want to please 
our audience:' Kling acIded. 
"but also ourselves." The group 
feels that their originals help 
keep them together. "Reed 
writes the words and sets the 
mood:' explains Gessel, and 
from that skeleton each 
member composes his own 
music. When they play together 

each has his own personal sound 
and no one Is conHned to an 
undesirable piece. 

Gessel. a drummer with ten 
years experience. cred Its 
Stewart Copeland of the Police 
as a great lnHuence. Gessel's 
strong rhythmic beat. 
characteristic of rock-a-billy. 
along with h Is own style of 
changing pace. provides a 
strikingly clever backdrop to 
the Nonames' music. Theirsong 
"Something In Common." 
Gessel's favorite to play. Is an 
eJlample of brilliant percussion. 

The group's fans have 
recognized Gessel's talent. At 
the Zebra Club one night a forty 
year old man hopped up on 
stage and lay on the Hoor under 
the drums. Gessel relates. He 
meant no harm so the group 
allowed him to stay. 

Pederson, a UCSD Economics 
and Spanish literature major. 
has a rapid vocal style along the 
lines oftheStray<:ats. His guitar 
playing has ' a basic, simple 
sound that compliments 
Gessel's drum work and allows 
the rest of the band to playas a 
cohesive unit 

Kling's Is the unique Norlame 
sound. His classical and jau 
background helps him to 
sustain long pieces and keep 
songs lively in sections where 
other groups sound stagnant 

The noNarncs blend together 
In a natural new sound Which, 
unlike the music trends of 
today. has an appeal to a wide 
range of music listeners. They 
delight audiences with exciting. 
enthusiastic originals. It is no 
surprise that the NoNames are 
finally getting a big name.

Insanity polariold exhibition at 
the Athenaeum Gallery (next to 
the Wall Street library in IJI 
Jolla) will have the opportunity 
to explore the feelings of a 
photographer during the taking 
of a photo. 

Gaber explains that by 
superimposing his Image onto 
the ~t. he Is trying to 
Investigate the photographer's 
feelings. ''TIle 35 mm and 415 
cameras are not made to see the 
way we see. They are perfected 
optlcaJ systems which are 
neutral emotionally. The tllm. 
tllters and finely tuned optics 
tend to enhance reality. Rather 
than how we see. these photos 
become how we would like to 
!Ce. 

'The quality of the lense and 
image of the polaroid Is closer 
to our vision. The polaroid 
carries the feelings of my taking 
the picture. what attracted my 
attention. I can take the 
polaroid photo and Immediate-
ly see the object and know my 
feelings as the event was 
happening. It becomes a 
psychological photography of 
immediately re-experlencing a 
moment that lust happened, 

frozen In time of the pOlaroid. 
which raises many questions 
about our feelings during an 
event." 

"What If we were able to step 
outside ounelves. to somehow 
view our feelings and then react 
to them. not our Image ofthem. 
We would laugh or maybe cringe 
In horror. 

"If we are truly free to feel -
that Is. react directly to 
something. anything - then we 
can move at will In and out of 
any experience without the fear 
that there is no exit. The choice 
to venture forth In one's life in 
this manner Is of course not to 
be taken lightly." 

8y comparing the camera's 
eye to our mind's e~. Gaber is 
challenging us to see reality not 
through the processing 
techniques of our mind's filters 
but to observe reality one step 
at a time as it instantly develops 
before our eyes. 

Harley Gabel's polaroid portraits show the photographer's feelings. 
"The polaroid catries tM feelings of my taking the picture."

Concert line 
Spear will 
bring red 
hot show 
When the Police first came on 
f'h ,~ scene a few years back they 
wele hailed as an innovative 
form of "white reggae." When 
th.! mod movement of the 
sixties was briefly revived In the 
UK it carried ska with it. Both of 
these recent trends in music 
have helped bring a wide 
a'_ceptance of traditional 
rt ggae played by reggae 
musicians. 

Burning Spear (whose given 
name is Winston Rodney) was 
born and raised in 5t. Ann's Bay, 
Janfaica - the same town that 
both Bob Marley and Markus 
Garvey were from. Uke many 
reggae performers, Burning 
Spear's acceptance in the 
United States has been a long 
time coming. Having performed 
since 1969, Burning Spear has 
produced some of the finest 
music to date, In tunes like 
"Markus Garvey" (a tribute to 
the late Markus Garvey and his 
work towards creating a united 
Africa) and "Slavery Days" 
Burning Spear shows more 
African rhythm influences than 
typical rhythm and blues, 
reflecting the growing trends 
towards Rastafarianism and 
African consciousness. 

Burning Spear will play 
tonight at Club Reggae on 
Broadway and 24th Streets in 
Golden Hills. For more 
information call 283-1566 or

In the mid-seventies an 
obscure keyboard player from 
the United States had a fantasy 
that he never dreamed would 
materialize. It was to find an 
established band that would 
take him In and with which he 
could play. "'!chad NcDonald 
realized not only the dream of 
playing on the same stage as the 
Doabie Brothers, but he went on 
to become the major creative 
force behind the band. 

"Takin ' It to the Streets," the 
first McDonald song released 
with the Doobie Brothers, 
became the tune for which they 
were best known. In addition to 
his band work McDonald also 
gained a reputation as a 
producer as well as for wOlking 
on projects with other artists. 
McDonald has since parted 
company with the Doobie 
Brothers in order to pursue a 
solo career. Michael McDonald 
will play this Saturday at the 
SDSU Amphitheater at 8 pm.

Ullywhlte. whose proteges

of Western pop and neo-

strong and steady, they lack the

My Very Dear Students, 
It has been a long, long time since you've 

heard from me, but I'm still around and I still 
, have you in my mind. Those of you who don't 

know me, let me give my brief introduction: 
5 years ago I started my business in the back 
alley of my one-room palace and in one 
parking slot. Conditions were that I would 
work for UCSD students only. Every UCSD 
student had to show the UCSD ID for me to 
work on their cars. I had many opportunities 
to work on very rich people's cars in La Jolla 
but since they didn't have a UCSD ID my 
seNices were refused. I was not making 
enough money on working on UCSD 
students' cars only so I moved into the 
common market. Now I have a very large 
business and I can afford to give my students 
the same deal that I was giving 5 years ago. 
That is a 15% student discount on parts and 
labor. Somehow my services to the students 
impressed the newspaper, The Daily 
Guardian and they printed the follOWing 
article on June 7, 1979: 

.. He Loses Shirt for Students 
By Heatherbell Fong 

Staff Writer 

• 

Her car had been towed in from the 
freeway. They told the UCSD student to 
expect the v.IOI'se ... if it needed a new engine 
she would be stuck for S8Cn The mechanic 
who checked the car found the gas tank 
empty: two dollars of gas was all the car 
needed. However, the owner of the garage 
called her and said she was lucky. All she 
needed was a new engine head. She could 
pick up the car in two weeks. He would 
charge her only $225 for the job. 

The mechanic quit on payday, deciding 
later to go into his own business. He would 
take only UCSD students as customers. 

"I am more happy helping students, 
because they deserve the most help," said 
Ricky Husain, owner of Overseas Automotive 
Repairs in La Jolla. 

"A student needs a car but doesn't have 
much money," said one of Husain's 
customers, Kent Shively. Shively first took 
his car to Husain fcr a minor problem that 
was fixed at no charge. The next job was 
bigger. When he got the the bill he noticed 
that although the total was $460, parts 
came to $390. 

"I should have charged him 5200 fcr labor 
r but I knew he couldn't affcrd It." said Husain . . 

Shively said the car is "running excellently" 

now. 
For the month of May this year, Husain's 

net loss was $2,465.33. He said that he is 
"losing money but buildIng up clientele." 

In the seven months since he went into 
business, Husain said, he has had about 
$1,700 worth of bad checks from students. 
He was calm about the high default rate. "I 
know what it is to be a student," he 
remarked. 

Husain lett his home in Pakistan because 
he did not like the way his parents' 25 
servants were treated. He completed his 
education in Vienna, receiving a Master's in 
Electrical and Mechanical Engineering. 

From there he went to Japan and worked 
for Toyota and Nissan. "You know the Datsun 
8-210?" asked Husain. "I designed about 
three quarters of that car." 

~ a job at General Motors, Husain 
lived for a couple months in Detroit. He quit 
because of the climate, he soid. He came 
here "just to see California," and decided 
to stay. lhls Is a paid adIIartiIernenl and not an endonemenl by

but students will get a 15% discount on top
