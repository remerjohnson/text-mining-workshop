uc Irvine's PET Scanner is one of only about 16 such machines in 
the United States. 

New brain scan 
machine aids in 
study of sleep 
By JON NALICK

For part-time work, Chris 
Le Penske could have done worse. 

In fact, for two nights, he had 
a job most would consider a 
dream come true. He got paid to 
sleep. 

Le Penske was part of a unique 
experiment performed at UCl's 
College of Medicine which re-
vealed for the first time which 
parts of the brain are directly 
involved in dreaming. 

The study, which began last 
June, involved researchers from 
UCI and UC San Diego and over 
20 volunteer subjects. 

For the volunteers, though, 
the job was a bit more stressful 
than a typical night's sleep. Each 
slept with an intravenous tube in 
his arm, several wires connecting 
his head to a polygraph machine, 
and was injected with radio-
actively-tagged glucose. 

It was pretty routine, LePenske 
said, "other than sleeping with 
needles in your arm." 

"The worst part is knowing 
when you lay down, [the re-
searchers] are counting on you 
to go to sleep," senior Russ Shi-
man said. "[But] the people 
around here are great. They've 
got a sense of humor and go out 
of their way to be friendly. 

The research team, lead by 
Monte Buchsbaum, professor of 
psychiatry and human behavior, 
has good reason to be in high 
spirits. . 

"For the first time in history, 

we'll be able to see what part of 
the brain is involved with dream-
ing, emotion, aggression, and 
sexuality," professor of psychia-
try Joseph Wu said. 

"It's an uncharted area," re-
search assistant Erin Hazlett 
said. "No one knows what the 
metabolism of the brain is like 
during sleep." 

The team also includes UC 
San Diego professor of psychia-
try Chris Gillin, who is an expert 
in dream study. The scientists 
decided that cooperation between 
UCI and UCSD would best suit 
the study. 

VCI's expertise lies in brain 
scanning technology, Gillin said, 
while VCSD is proficient in the 
study of sleep and dreaming. 

"[The study] provides a bridge 
between psychoanalysts and bi-
ologists - for the first time, they 
can meet on common ground, 
and [find] where our dreams 
come from," Wu said. 

What makes this new research 
possible is a S 1 million PET 
(positron emission tomography) 
scanner, purchased by UCI three 
years ago. There are only around 
16 scanners in the United States. 

Hazlett said the scanner allows 
researchers to view which parts 
of the brain are active during 
various activities. The important 
distinction between the PET 
scanner and more conventional 
CAT (computer axial tomogra-
phy) scans is that the PET 
scanner describes brain function.

Simulates immune sy-stem 

Computer model may help 
reduce use of lao animals 

By LINDA GLA VE 
Stll/f Writer 

Though the San Diego Board 
of Supervisors voted to continue 
UCSD's contract with the pound 
for animal research, one man has 
found what he feels is a viable 
alternative to the use of animals 
in scientific research . Hans 
Sieburg, a researcher at Salk 
Institute, believes that animal 
subjects are not a very cost effi-
cient, time efficient, or humane 
method of "scientific" research, 
and has investigated the subject. 

"My goal, and I think I'm 
pretty alone on this, is to save 
animal lives, and to cut down on 
the suffering. Another benefit is 
that you save a lot of money and 
time," Sieburg explained. 

Working in conjunction with 
his wife, Christa, a cellular im-
munologist at Eli Lilly Research 
Laboratories in La Jolla, and 
Dave Pauza, a molecular bio-
logist at Salk Institute, Sieburg 
has developed a unique method 
of experimentation. Through a 
mathematical model and com-
puter simulation, Sieburg has 
reversed t he experimentation 
process that has been a mainstay 
of scientific research since it first 
began. 

Currently, research with lab 

animals involves testing a hypo-
thesis in a variety of different 
ways, all of them involving the 
animals. Only after the hypothesis 
has been proven by these some-
what time-consuming and tedious 
methods is a mathematical model 
developed and tested. 

"What I have done is to invent 
the tool that would allow the 

modeler and the experimenter 
together to evaluate hypotheses, 
and, if the hypothesis is good, to 
come up with a prediction [of the 
conclusion of the experiment] 
before the experiment has ac-
tually been done," Sieburg said. 

Sieburg used the immune 
system as the model for his com-

Remark: Racism by councilmember alleged 
Continued from pace I 
heard Dave Manheim, A.S . vice 
president administrative, say that 
he hoped the African American 
Student Union (AASU) wouldn't 
attend the meeting. 

"It was in a negative tone ... 
We weren't there.for the African 
Student Union . .. I was upset ... 
it was depressing," explained 
Whisenhunt. She felt it was an 

on their behalf," Manheim said. 
Next Wednesday the council will 
vote on allocating S3,000 for two 
speakers for Black History 
Month, and Manheim had sub-
mitted this legislation to council. 

Manheim made his comment 
in part, he says, because the 
AASU didn't need to come last 
week to the meeting to show 

support for the allocation re-
quest . They would need to come 
this week . 

"I've always encouraged peo-
ple to come to A.S. meetings ... 
that 's where I found I was 
wrong," Manheim said later. 

"I had falsely assumed that she 
was from the AASU . They were 
there from the People s Voice. 

That was my fault," Manheim 
admitted . 

In other council news, the 
council voted to allocate S 1,794 
to send two council members to 
the N A CA Confere nce in 
Washington, after a lengthy dis-
cussion regarding why UCSD 
needs two people to go rather 
than just one. 

"!t's [the conference] too big 
for one person to go to," said 
Evan Weisenfeld, chair of the 
University Center Board. Other 
council members expressed con-
cern over the need for the entire 
council to benefit from the con-
ference when so much money is 
spent sending representatives 
there . (Q)

student 
selected 
as Regent 

Deborah Ruth Thorpe, a jun-
ior at UC Davis , will be recom-
mended for appointment as the 
University of California student 
Regent for 1988-89. The full 
Board of Regents will act on the 
appointment at its Feb. 18 meet-
ing at UC San Francisco. 

Thorpe was among 68 appli-
ca nts representing the U niversi-
ty's nine campuses. She succeeds 
Jacquelyn Ross, also from Davis, 
as the student Regent and is the 
th ird st udent in four years from 
the Davis campus to hold the 
position . 

The University ~f California I 
Student Association nominated 
three finalists to be interviewed 
by a Regents' committee. The 
other two finalists were Erik Basil 
from UC San Diego, and Sumi 
Cho from UC Berkeley. 

Thorpe, a chemistry major, 
served as a high school science 
and mathematics teacher for four 
months in Trinidad, West Indies, 
before entering UC. At Davis 
she has served as a resident advi-
sor helping new students adjust 
to university life, and as an aca-
demic peer advisor helping with 
course scheduling and academic 
requirements. 

In a statement submitted to 
the selection committee, Thorpe 
listed the three most important 
issues facing California higher 
education today as increasing 
the enrollment of minorities and 
women, improving relations 
between community colleges and 
four-year universities, and main-
taining a high standard in educa-
tion and research. 

Upon confirmation by the 
Board , Thorpe will serve as 
Regent Designate, sitting on the 
board a non-voting member, 
until July I, 1988 when her term 
as student Regent begins. Her 
terms expires on June 30 
1989.

Emergency- care 

AIDS association: 
will it kill us? 

By CAROL LOBO 

It seems one lucrative business these day would be 
manufacturing rubber gloves. With the increasing fear of 
AI DS no one wants to take the ri sk of catching this ever-
spreading disease. Precautions are being taken by using rubber 
glove ~ in situations where they haven't been used before. I 
notice dentists are now using rubber gloves - which is a good 
idea considering what type of work they are doing. Many 
firemen are using gloves as well when dealing with injury 
victims, especially in cases of heavy bleeding. 

Unfortunately another type of problem exists. Many people 
are so fear stricken with the thought of catching AI DS that they 
often refuse to have contact with strangers on any account. 
This includes police and firemen in crisis situations. 

In an article in the ViI/age Voice, it was noted that an actor 
died on the streets of New York while having a seizure because 
when police arrived they refused to help . They told the man's 
friend to be patient and wait for the paramedics to arrive. Since 
the two men were together in a "gay part of town" the police 
assumed that they were gay and therefore had AIDS . They 
didn't want to risk catching the disease so they refused to help 
at all, claiming they are not prepared to handle those types of 
situations. 

I find this hard to believe considering the kind of training 
policemen go through . I can understand how people can be 
afraid ; this is a natural response. However, I do not find this a 
legitimate excuse for such irresponsible behavior. Lives are 
being sacrificed in the hope of avoiding the disease. It's not as if 
discretion can not be taken to avoid being infected with the 
virus while being able to help victims at the same time. By using 
gloves and masks while on du~y , firemen and policemen would 
not have to be as worried and could fulfill their assignments 
with little hesi tation . People should consider this option before 
deciding to deny assistance as a Tesuit of fear.

South African sanctions 
detrimental to job market 
Editor: 

It has recently been reported 
that orne members of Congress 
will be introducing more pu-
nitive sanctions against the 
regime in South Africa to induce 
t he government to institute 
further reforms . Strong op-
ponents of apartheid have ar-
gued, however, that sanctions 
a nd disinvestment might have an 
adverse effect on the livelihood 
of black South Africans. Recent 
opinion polls of South Africans 
confirm these suspicions . 

John Kane-Berman of the 
South African Institute of Race 
Relations reported last month 
that in 12 of 14 polls conducted 
over the last year, more black 
South Africans were opposed to 
anctions than in favor of them. 

In eight of these polls , opponents 
of sanctions outnumbered sup-
porters by a two-to-one margin. 

Likewise, a survey by 
Germany's African Foundation 
found that two-thirds of black 
coal miners in South Africa do 
not want sanctions because they 
fear sanctions will cost them 
their jobs. The fact is , sanctions 
have already cost many South 
Africans not only their jobs, but 
the opportunity for advance-
ment in a society that is moving 
slowly but surely toward de-
segregation and full democra-
tization.

Students to tell all 
about themselves 
Editor: 
As founder of We The People"a 
new student publication, I would 
like to take this opportunity to 
respond to Margot Waltz's feisty 
letter (Guardian, Dec. 19). 

Congratulations to yet 
another astute reader who 
recognizes that something seems 
to be missing from the student 
publications of UCSD: the stu-
dent. Like Ms. Waltz, I, ioo, 
would like to read about the 
diverse and noteworthy (though 
not necessarily well-known) stu-
dents and student organizations 
of our unique campus. Students 
aren't getting equal coverage 
from the publication they 
su~port. 

Yet, while UCSD journalism 
needs to focu s more on the 
students themselves , is it really 
realistic , or even fair to expect 
the UCSD Guardian to cover 
them all (along with news, fea-
tures, sports, shorts, etc.)? No, 
what we need is a publication of 
our own; one that will specialize 
in the UCSD ·tudent; one that 
will represent the diversity of the 
student population, because 
that's what it's all about; one 
that's all about "we the people" 
of UCSD. 

As a matter of fact... Margot 
Waltz' letter is extremely timely, 
because, at this moment, stu-
dents are coming together to 
create one such publication. We 
The People is a brand new 
quarterly publication formed 
tlot only by the students and for 
the students, but about the 
students as well. And unlike 
other alternative media of 
UCSD, We The People focuses 
on people of all different races, 
religions, political views, sexual 
gender, sexual preference, etc. 
(plus no caffeine .... ) What more 
could a "nosey" reader like Ms. 
Waltz (and myself) want? 

We're just in our beginning 
stages, and welcome the input 
and idea of the students we seek 
to represent. People who like to 
write, design, or just meet 
people, or who know of in-
teresting students or events to 
profile, are encouraged to con-
tact us at UCSD L-5, La Jolla , 
92093 or through A.S . and 
EDNA.

a gamble, Hazlett said . 

For example, radioactive ma-
terial must be flown down from 
UC Davi on a chartered plane 
and rushed to the medical center, 

To provide additional clue 
about dreaming, the researchers 
asked subjects about what they 
remembered immediately after 
waking up, focusi ng on dream 
content and the presence of color 
or vivid visual images .

The PET scanner picks up

puter simulation. The hardware, 
called the Ce llular Device 
Machine(CDM), is a board that 
may be plugged into a standard 
personal computer, like an Apple 
II. A piece of software named the 
Artificial Immune System (AIS) 
cc..m bines with the COM to 
sim ulate either a normal or dis-
eased immune system. 

The biological immune system 
works in two functionally inte-
grated parts. The first, called the 
innate immune system, simply 

recognizes substances, called anti-
gens, which occur in the body 
systems. T he second , called the 
adaptive immune system, identi-
fies specific antigens through a 
varie ty of adapter molecules 
known as antigen receptors. 

The adaptive immune sys tem 
also has a process called memory, 
which enables it to a quicker and 
more efficient secondary response 
if the invading antigen persists or 
challenges the host a second time. 
Both parts, however, make a 
distinction between selfand non -
self antigens. This distinction is. 
learned and effected through 
comparison against the system's 
antigen receptor variety or reper-

toire, and only foreign antigens 
ca use the immune system to 
respond . 

The Artificial I mmune System 
program creates a mathematical 
model of the immune system 
using the Cellular Device Ma-
chi ne, whereupon data (such as' 
antigen types) can be fed into the 
program (t he immune system) 
and the information processed 
accordingly. 

"The output would always look 
like, if it's a bod y-owned mole-
cule, then [there will be] no im-
mune reaction . If it's a foreign 
molecule, then [there will be] an 
immune reactions ," Sieburg said. 

What makes Sieburg's inven-

tion so original is that it repres-
ents a breakthrough in experi-

~~nta' science. Computer simu-
lations have been attempted 
before, the most notable of these 
being the Lotka-Volterra oscilla-
tor approach . A simple example 
of their equation is a model of 
the interaction between a popu-
lation of predators feeding on a 
population of prey. Both popu-
lations oscillate with respect to 
time and density of the . other 
population. However, none of 
these simulations has ever been 
completely successful.

explained that previously scien-
tific research has always involved 
the search for the interactions of

ces, that caused an immunologi-

UNIX frees students from the typewriter 

Ken Relnsleln/ Guardian 
Dr Jeff Elman. a professor of linguistics, said that UNIX is very effi cient, although some users stili want 
better access. 

By LAURA KNAPP 

Have you ever wanted to throw 
yo ur typewrite r in a t rash can 
after the ribbon runs out? Or are 
you t ired of us ing an entire bottle 
of white-out for every paper that 
need s to be typed? What do you 
do when you decide you need to 
move a paragraph after your 
pa per 's done? 

Worry no longer. T here is a 
so lution to these problems that 
does not involve buying a com-
puter. It's the UNIX systems 
word processor available th rough 

the computers on campus , and 
which is open to all students, 
whet her you're studying engineer-
ing, music or literature. 

Dr. Jeff Elman, a professor of 
linguist ics, commented on the 
computer system here . "UCSD 
[has] greater access to computers 
in general to a wider diversity of 
students, staff and faculty than 
at most places ... Unfortunatel y, 
there are still so me groups who 
don 't have the access they need 
o r want , but , overall , the sys-
tem's pretty good ." 

Taking El man's cour e is one 
way to learn how to get the most 

out of UNIX. Linguistics 63 , (an 
introductory course to UNIX.) 

Dan Gradwohl, a senior his-
tory major, has been a T .A. for 
the class for eight quarters and 
he thinks it's beneficial for peo-
ple to learn general computer 
skills and UNIX primarily for 
the simple reason that it makes it 
so easy to write papers. 

" Since I learned [UNIX], I've 
used it for every single paper. 
[It 's] something that's there that 
people do not know about." 

He said that this was a prob-
lem for him when he came to 
UCSD. " Before I took the class, 

N . Y. Times columnist 
to speak on U.S. politics 
By LINDA GLA VE 
Staff Writer 

Tom Wicker, syndicated colum-
nis t a nd form er Was h ingto n 
bureau chief for the New York 
Times, will speak next week on 
the present state of the American 
poli tical parties. Wicker has been 
inv ited to UCSD as a Regent's 
Lecturer by the history depart-
ment. 

" Every year or so, our depart-
ment has attempted to bring to 
the campus people who are inter-
esting, outstanding figures from 
the world of journalism, la"', 
and politics. The Regent's Lec-
tureships are designed to bring 
to the campus non-academics ... 
who are extremely talented in 
the ir line of work," Michael Par-
rish , a history professor and chair 
of the department said . 

" I'm glad that the history de-
partment sponsored him," com-
munication professor Robert 
Horwitz said . "It 's good for us to 
bring good working journalists 
who are in influential positions 
vis-a-vis their notoriety, their in-
fluence. He's a player on the 
national scene. He's a part of the 
public 's fear of policy." 

In addition to working for five 
different newspapers as writer, 
editor , and correspondent , 
Wicker has also held po itions as 
the executive director of the 

Southern P ines Chamber of Com-
merce in North Carol ina , and as 
public information director of 
the North Carolina Board o f 
Publ ic Welfare in Raleigh. 

From 1960 to 1964 Wicker 
was a correspondent with the 
Washington Bureau of the new 
York Times, and chief of the 
bureau from 1964 to 1968. 

Wicker has been an outspoken 
and somewhat controversial col-
umnist for the New York Times 
since 1966 when he first started 
wr iting his now nationally syn-

"He's a very reflec-
tive columnist. " 

-Robert Horwitz 

dicated column "In the Nation ." 
In 1972 he moved to the New 
York offices of the Times and 
c ontinues to write "In The 
Nation" for the Op-Ed Page. 

" He's a very reflective colum-
nist ," Horwitz said . "He isn't a 
mundane, [or] predictable [col -
umnist] . A lot of columns are 
tedious and dull. His are not. 
They are usually enlightening 
and interesting." 

Daniel Hallin , a communica-
tion-professor, said " Wicker is 

perfect [to be a Regent's Lec-
turer] because he's a very promi-
nent j ournali st, a nd a journalist 
who can speak to the academic 
community better than most be-
cause he's very widely read and 
he knows something about his-
tory. 

"One problem with American 
columnists is that they are , in a 
way,just doing recording through 
another medium , they'rejust try-
ing to give you a bit of informa-
tion dug up from some sources 
that they have. [They don't] fill 
what is a big hole in American 
journalism, which is to give 
analysis , to give opinioll, to talk 
about what the news means and 
what we should do, rather than 
to just give more news. I think 
that Wicker more than others 
gives you that kind of analysis 
and a real opinion . He knows a 
lot about history and can put a 
lot in perspective ," Hallin said . 

Horwitz concurred , "Wicker 
uses the arguments that are in 
the public arena that get no 
press. He usuall y plays those, 
and tries to make arguments, 
and tries to frame larger argu-
ments than the immediate day's 
news . And he does that very 
well ." 

Wicker will speak this Tues-
day and Thursday in Peterson 
Hall room 108 at 8 pm. [ill 

I never realized what the compu-
ters were for. A lot of people 
don't realize they're here for us 
to use." 

It is possible to learn to use the 
system on your own, but starting 
sometimes can be difficult. Accor-
ding to Phil Mcoog, a UNIX 
consultant at UCSD, students 
sometimes come in to type a 
paper that's due the next day on 
the word processor. If they're 
never used it before, "the first 
paper is going to take twice as 
long as on a typewriter, but after 
the initial experience it becomes 
much easier." 

I n recent years, the system was 
not available to all students. Now, 
however, "access has been en-
hanced to the point where eve-
ryone can get an account . I n the 
past, it was a problem ... people 

universities were using the sys-
tem, but it did not become com-
mercially available until about 
four years ago . Elman said that 
one of the reasons for this is that , 
by this time, there was a need for 
UNIX in industry. Universities 
were training engineers in UNIX, 
yet, when they got out of college 
and began working, they were 
finding archaic software rather 
than the more up to date UNIX 
system they had been used to. 
Elman said that because of this 
"A generation of UNIX bans or 
fanatics was bred." 

Since that time, new technol-
ogy has made available hundreds 
of types of computers that are 
affordable to the people in their 
homes, even some that have word 
processors that rival those of 
UNIX . Elman feels, however, 

Electronic mail allows people to send letters 
and papers through the computer to places 
as far as London. It is a way to pass on 
information to other locations that also use 
UNIX. 

would do anything to get an 
account." Gradwohl said. 

Mcoog finds problems not with 
the UNIX system itself but with 
the UCSD resources. He said 
that sometimes the system is 
overcrowded because so many 
people want to use the compu-
ters and the UNIX system is 
being overloaded. 

The UNIX system started in 
the mid 1970s at Bell Laborato-
ries. In 1979, '80 and '81 Bell 
Labs made the system available 
to universities around the coun-
try for free , but there was no 
support in the event of repairs or 
breakdowns. This is about the 
time when the UCSD depart-
ment research started in areas 
such as chemistry, cognitive 
science, linguistics and music. 

The UNIX system grew as a 
small but increasing number of 

why ne 'P 
Why he le" .... e 

tu rS f.11 ~o",n 
CO'ier fo.'e 

that the UNIX system is still 
"one of the single most popular 
operating systems." 

Elman believes that UNIX af-
fords benefits beyond word pro-
cessing. One is that it can be used 
on several different types of com-
puter systems. Also it provides 
self-contained programs with 
each doing a specific job which 
can, in turn, be combined in 
more complex programs. This 
makes it easier for people who 
do not kn'Ow how to program to 
use the system. 

Electronic mail is another attri-
bute which makes UNIX useful 
and popular: This feature allows 
people to send letters and papers 
through the compllter to places 
as far as London. It is a way to

edge to other locations that also

Lecturer to address the 
subject of sexual harassment 
in the academic community 
By MICHELE BIDWELL 
Staff Writer 

Dr. Bernice Sandler, director 
of tJ:ie Project on the Status and 
Education of Women of the As-
sociation of American Colleges, 
will be hosting a forum on the 
issues of sexual harassment in 
the academic community and 
other related topics. The lecture 
will be held on Thursday, Jan. 
28, from 12:30-2:00 pm in the 
International Center. 

AS former education special-
ist for the House of Representa-
tives' Special Subcommittee on 
Educat ion , Sandler played a 
major role in the passage of Title 
IX, a law which prohibits sexual 
discrimination against students 
and employees. Sandler has also 
held distinctive positions on var-
ious national committees and 
councils and has received several 
awards and six honorary docto-
rates for her work. She is consi-
dered a national expert on sex-
ual harassment. 

"Sexual harassment has been 
a problem on campus for a long 
time, but it has really come out in 
the open in the last few years 
because the laws have changed," 
Sandler said. 

"Sexual harassment is any un-
wanted behavior of a sexual 
nature that occurs in a power 
relationship when one person 
has the power to harm another 
person," she explains . In an on-
campus situation, "faculty and 
staff are really taking advantage 
of the power they have over 
students . " 

''I'm primarily talking about 
men harassing women because 
99 percent of it is men harassing 
women, although it is possible 
for women to harass men ," 
Sandler added. 

Dr) sernice Sandler 

Sandler also stated that the 
legal definition of sexual harass-
ment has expanded . Now, sexual 
harassment not only refers to 
sexual bribes and / or threats but 
it also includes, what Sandler 
terms , "a chilly or offensive en-
vironment." For example, jok-
ing about a women's sexuality 
and / or making lewd references 
and gestures is now defined as 
sexual harassment. 

Sandler estimates that "20 to 
30 percent of women under-
graduates experience some form 

.of sexual harassment [and] sex-
ual harassment on the graduate 
level is more prevalent." 

"What I'm trying to do is give 
people an understanding of what 
sexual harassment is and what it 
isn't," Sandler said. She will also 
be addressing actions that sexu-
ally harassed victims can and 
should take, both informally and 
formally . 

Sandler's forums are sponsored 
by the Student Safety Awareness 
Program, assistant Vice Chan-
cellor Faustina Solis , the deans 
from all four colleges and the 
Women's Caucus. For more infor-
mation on Dr. Sandler's forums,

ness Program at 534-5793. [ill

defects ," Mandell said . "The 
causes are really irrelevant, and, 
with Hans' machine, we can 
ignore the cause and go into the 
middle of the disease." 

The most obvious applications 
of Sieburg's AIS program are to 
the study of cancer and AIDS . 

"We have considered the re-
sponses to viruses and this leads 
into the que tion of cancer, be-
cause there are virus-induced 
cancers," Sieburg said . .. H ow-
ever, " he added , "the precise 
applications to individual cancers 
are far in the future . We have to 
do more thinking, more search 
for relevance." 

In studying AIDS , however, 
the question approached was 
whether all AIDS symptoms and 
ultimate death are the result of 
the specific depletion ofT -4 cells. 
T -4 cells carry the receptors that 
arc specific to the human immuno-
deficiency virus (HIV). When 
Sicburg began his research about 
a year ago , specific T -4 cell 
depletion was believed to be the 
primary ca use of A I OS in 
hlllrtans. '· I I , . , 

It was discovered that it was 
not solely the depletion of T-4 
cells that causes AIDS, but in-
stead, a combination of more 
than one kind of cell defines the 
development of that disease. 

Sieburg foresees his invention 
being used not only by research-
ers in hospitals and laboratories, 
but by universities as a training 
tool. 

"We see students being edu-
cated on the immune system by 
this simulator. They hear a lot 
about T-cells and such in their 
classes, but they don't see them. 
They can play around with [cells 
on the computer] and actually 
see what does and doesn't work . 
So, it is essentially a textbook on 
the computer," Sieburg said. 

Mandell asserts that computer 
simulation of biological systems 
is an emerging field , and that the 
only limitations are, "the imagi-
nation and capacity of the theo-
rists. " 

"It's an early 'golden age' in 
the field. If it does work - it will 
work - it's unlimited." If)

Commentary_ 
If defense spells win, 
the Redskins are in 

By MIKE U'REN 

Thi has been one of the crazi-
e t sea ons in FL history. Out 
of o nly 15 games, three were 
played by replacement players 
during the strike. 

The San Diego Chargers 
jumped out to an 8-1 record, 
only to drop their next six and 
eliminate themselves from the 
playoffs. 

How about the Rams trading 
away Eric Dickerson to the Colts 
where he helped the Colts to 
their first division title and 
playoff birth since 1977? Let u s 
not forget Rams running back 
Charlie White. Backup to Dick-
erson for the last two years, he 
led the league in rushing for the 
first time in his career. 

Yes, it was a crazy season but 
the Super Bowl representati ves 
from both leagues have finally 
been decided. The Washington 
Redskins who will be making 
their th ird trip in the last six 
years will face the Denver Bron-
cos, the first team since the 

Pittsburgh Steelers in 1978 and 
1979 to participate in consecu-
tive Super Bowls. 

either team coasted into the 
Super Bowl. The Red kin upset 
a tough Chicago Bear team in 
Chieago and then held off a last 
minute rally by the stubborn and 
upset-minded Minnesota Vikings 
to have the honor of represent-
ing the NFC in the Super Bowl. 

Likewise, the Broncos defeated 
the Houston Oiler and held off 
a late rally by the Cleveland 
Browns when Ernest Byner fum-
bled at Denver's two ya rd line 
and was recovered by Denver 
cornerback Jeremiah Castille to 
seal the victory . Nevertheless, 
the outcome is the same. These 
two clubs will meet each other at 
San Diego's Jack Murphy Sta-
dium on Jan . 31 t o see who is the 
best team in the NFL. 

Thi game will showcase the 
offensive talents of Denver's 
young quarterback John Elway, 
this year's Most Valuable Player 
in the NFL, and his three receiv-

Surf team chooses 
1988 members 

The gathering of UCSD su rfers 
competing in the team tryouts at 
Black's Beach on Saturday was a 
d ynamic foresight of what to 
expect thi s seaso n from these 
talented artisans of the wave as 
they carved their powerful signa-
tures into the face of the pound-
ing surf. Ranked fourth in the 
nation , UCSD is in position to 
topple the top schools from Cali-
fornia , the East coast, Hawaii 
and Texas. 

Two factors explain UCSD's 
co ntention for the National 
Championship title , said team 
coach and competitor Mike 
Gleevy. "We are looking better 
than la st year . We've got four of 
our six strongest urfers return-
ing from last year in addition to a 
few highly impressive new -
comers. " 

Two teams co mpete for 
UCSD, each co nsisting of six 
men, o ne woman. one kneeride r , 
and one bodyboarder. This year's 

"A" team surfers are Bra d Afri-
cano, Steve Colt , Gleevy, Alan 
Johnson (team captain) , Don 
O'Neil, and Sean West. 1 n the 
women's division is Isabelle 
Tihanyi . 

In kneeriding competition 
UCS D boasts U.S. Amateur 
National Champion and U.S. 
National Team World Champ-
ionship competitor Jack Beres-
ford . 1987 Collegiate Champion 
Bob Crawford will compete in 
the bodyboarding events. 

"With such a strong lincup, we 
are definitely going to be in con-
tention for the national title," 
said Gleevy. "There's a lot of 
excitement about what we see 
for both the" A" and "B" teams 
because we have so much talent." 

Beresford , club president, is 
also ve ry enthusiastic about the 
team but is disappointed at the 
lack of funding this year . Ac-

Elway ha s been a prolific 
passer all season and will be the

he was noth ing short of spectac-

the punter didn't even come onto

Elway shredded the Brown 's

Super 
Bowl 
Continued from plge 13 
suffering from a hemorrhaging 
femoral artery in one leg. 

Johnson received the injury 
during the victory over Houston 
the week before, and is expected 
to play co me Super Bowl time. 
This could be bad news for the 
Redskin defensive backs who had 
trouble containing Minnesota's 
explosive receiver Antony Car-
ter during Sunday's outing 
against the Vikings . 

For the Redskins to be victor-
ious, their pass rush must keep 
pressure on E lway throughout 
the game. Led by defensive ends 
Mann and Manley and outside 
tackle Dave Butz, the 'Redskins 
were able to sack mobile Viking 
quarterback Wade Wilson eight 
times - one shy of the playoff 
record set by the San Francisco 
Forty-Niners in 1984. 

The Redskins will have to try 
to get to Elway early and must 
keep him in the pocket because 
he is a very effective passer on 
the run. 

Although Denver has a very 
potent offensive attack, their de-
fense leaves much to be desired. 
The Orange Crush seemed to 
crumble right in front of Cleve-
land quarterback Bernie Kosar, 
who led his team to four consec-
utive touchdowns in the second 
half. 

Denver should be worried after 
their lack-luster defensive per-
formance, but Washington's of-
fensive unit played just as poorly. 
Doug Williams had a pathetic 
showing against the Vikings, 
completing only 9 of 26 passes 
for 119 yards. At one point in the 
first half Willian,s completed 
only I of 12 passes and over-
threw three receivers for possible 
touchdowns. 

Although the Redskins can be 
given the edge in the running 
game with former Hei sman 
Trophy winner George Rogers 
leading the way , the Broncos 
have a more balanced offensive 
attack and probably the best 
passer in professional football 
calling the plays. The incredible 
four-man and sometimes five-
man pass rush of the Redskins 
gives them the definite edge on 
defense. 

The keys to victory for the 
Broncos will lie on the shoulders 
of John Elway and his ability to 
get the ball into the hands of 
Johnson, Jackson, and Nattie!. 
The Denver defense must also 
play much better and slow down 
the rushing attack of the 
Redskins. 

For Washington, they must 
keep the score low and their 
defense must rise to the occa-
sio n. If Darrel Green, who had 
to take a pain killer before the 
game against Minnesota , can get 
healthy by game time, his blaz-
ing s peed in the defe nsive back 
field could mak e it a long day for 
the Three Amigo' and John 
Elway. 

If the Red ski ns ca n control the 
line of scrimmage and contain 
John Elway, the New York 
Giants' Hulmes puts it best by 
saying, "The team with the best 
defense wins the Super Bowl, 
and that will be the Washington 
Reds kins." @)
