AFTER YEARS OF BEING RELEGATED 
TO THE MAIN GYM, UCSD'S DANCE 

PROGRAM HAS A NEW HOME 

The UCSD Department of Theatre and 
Dance took a tremendous step forward with 
the completion of its new $3 million Dance 
Studio Facility. The facility 's grand opening 
on Tuesday featured dance demonstrations 
and remarks by UCSD oflici als and the 
structure's intemationally renowned archi -
tect, Antoine Predock. 

Chancellor ROQert Dynes expressed his 
enthusiasm for UCSD's role in contributing 
to the arts in San Diego. 

"Just as the Mandell Weiss Theatre has 
become a big part or San Dicgo, this 
dance faci Iity wi II al so allow us to show-
case San Diego's dance quality," Dynes 
said .

Located near Revelle College in a euca-

choreography, ballet, jazz, modern, tap and 
ethnic dance. The studios, situated around

Gambling Linked to High Suicide Levels 
STUDY: Researchers 
calculated results using 
death certificates 
By Jenny Nicholson 
Staff Writer 

Gambler may have morc at 
stake than their money, according 
to a new study conducted by 
U SO ociolog Professor David 
Phillips in co ll aboration with 
UCSO graduate student Marisa 
Smith and UCSD undergraduate 
student Ward Welty. 

The study, "Elevated Suicide 

Levels Associated with Legalized 
Gambling," is the first widespread 
stati stical investigation to find a 
link between gambling and abnor-
mally high levels of suicide. 

Over the last decade, there ha 
been an enormous increase in 
lega li zed gambling throughout the 
United States. Since 1981>1, the 
number of tates with legalized 
gambling has Icaped from two, 
Nevada and New Jersey, to more 
than half the nalion. 

The study showed that in 1994, 
people spent about $482 billion on 
gambling - more than the gov-

ernment spends on Medicare and 
Medicaid combined. 

The data for the study came 
from computeri zed records of 
death certificates obtained from 
the National Center for Health 
Statistics. This data was used to 
calculate the suicide levels of Las 
Vegas. Reno and Atlantic City, and 
was subsequently compared to sui -
cide level in other U.S. cities. 

The suicide level is (;omputed 
by dividing the number of total 
deaths into the number of deaths 
by suicide. To make sure that the

Influenza 
Bug Hits 
Campus 
ILLNESS: Number of 
cases have not reachec;:l 
epidemic proportions 
By Julia Kulla-Mader 
Co-News Editor 

With winter quarter just begin-
ning, some students arc already 
wishing it was over so they can 
have a break to recover from their 
colds and flus. 

However, UCSD and the San 
Diego community have not been 
hit particularly hard by this year's 
viruses. 

According to George Shumaik, 
medical di~tor of UCSD's two 
emergency rooms, the number of 
people suffering from flu and cold 
viruses this year is nowhere near 
epidemic proportions. 

"The flu is probably several 
viral illnesses," Shumaik said. 
''There's not any medical evidence 
that we 're having an influenza epi-
demic." 

According to Patient Services 
Manager Sherry Hendrickson. 
Student Health Services has not been 
unusually busy since school started. 

"For us at Student Health, this has 
been very typical," she said. "We've 
seen no huge increase as of yet. " 

However, Hendrickson stressed 
that the majority of student~ 
usually don' t get sick during the 
first few weeks of the quarter. 

"Typically students need to get 
back from wherever they ' ve 
been... [theyl interact with each 
other in our closed environment, 
and then we tend to see the actual 
influenza a lillie later than the fi rst 
week of classes," Hendrickson 
aid. "So, if we have people bring-

ing in influenza from outside of 
this area, they have an opportunity 
to give that to other people in that 
first week or so." 

According to Shumaik, the flu 
and the common cold are different 
beasts. 

"They' re both viral illnesses," 
Shumaik said. ' 'The flu is a much 
more aggressive illness - very 
high fever, 103°, 105°, people 
have a cough, they feel like 
they ' ve been hit by a truck because 
of the aehes and pains. [This is] a 
much more aggressive-appearing 
illness than your average co ld 
where you get a little sore throat 
and a little fever, a little runny 
nose and a little bit of a cough."

Unknown Form of Nitrous Oxide 
Found in Earth's Atmosphere NOW ENROLLING: SAN DIEGO'S #1 COURSE FOR THE 
GREENHOUSE: 
Laughing gas can 
destroy ozone 
By Anna Valsman 
Senior Staff Writer 

Long considered to be a harm -
less substance used by dentists. 
laughing gas in the Ea rth 's upper 
atmosphere is no laughing matter. 

UCSD chemistry and biochem-
istry Professor Mark Thiemens and 
graduate student Steve Cliff recent-
ly completed a st udy of atmospher-
ic nitrous oxide conducted over the 
course of the past fi ve years. Their 
findings were published in last 
month 's issue of the journal 
Science. 

Nitrous oxide is more effective 
than chlorolluorocarbons (CFCs). 
or any other substance, at destroy-
ing ozone. Nitrous oxide is a green-
house gas that warms the planet 
about 200 times more effici ently 
than carbon dioxide. 

Nitrous oxide traps heat from 
the sun and the atmosphere, con-
tributing to the greenhouse 
effect. 

"If it's a concern that [carbon 
dio)(ide] is increasing. then it 's def-
initely a concern that nitrous oxide 
is increasing because it 's a much 
more eFfective Igreenhouse gas] ," 
Cliff said. 

The UCSD researchers recently 
discovered a new form of nit rous 
oxide in the atlllosphere of 
unknown ori gi n. 

For several decades, scienli sls 
have been tryi ng to account for a

SAVINGS 

30-pen;ent discrepancy between 
the known ni trous oxide sources 
entering the atmosphere and the 
chemical's subsequent removal. 

The model which had been used 
for the past three decades did not 
account for the isotopes of the gas 
and therefore was not presenting a 
complete picture. 

Thiemens and Cliff are using a 
method that accounts for the iso-
topes, including some with a new 
chemical signature that they 
recently discovered . This new 
method gives a more accurate 

highest levels turned out to be at 
about 12,000 feet above sea level , 
at White Mountain. 

"[The fact that) there is more 
of the anoma ly at higher eleva-
tions implies that the signature 
comes from s tratospheric ai r," 
Cliff said. 

The amount of nitrous oxide 
in the atmosphere has been 
increasing by appro)(imately 0.2 
percen! per year for about a hun-
dred years. Cliff said. The current 
leve l is abOUI 300 parts per bil -
lion. which is one- third more 

assessment of the 
situation in the 
atmosphere. 

Thiemens and 
Cliff measured 
amounts of nitrous 
oxide isotopes at 
ground level in var-
ious locations with 
differing eleva-
tions: La Jolla, 
Pasadena and the 
White Mountain 
Research Station, 
all in California; 
and at the White 
Sands Missile 
Range in New 
Mexico.

that (carbon

It's definitely a 
concern that

because It's a

trial levels, he 
added. 

According to 
Cliff, most of Ihe 
increase is due to 
naturally occur-
ring processes and 
is therefore not a 
cause for alarm. 
He added that the 
increase is not 
conipletely under-
stood, however.

UCSD's Improved Dance 
Program Takes the Stage 

Congratul ati ons are in order to the UCSD 
Department of Theatre and Dance. With both its 
October 1997 desi gnation as a legitimate program 
of study and the Tuesday opening of the new 
Dance Stud io Fucility, the Dance Program at 
UCSD hus show n that it s accomp li shmen t~ 
throughout the years ha ve earned it nationClI ulten-
ti on and merit. 

The program fought hard to attai n the status it 
has reached loday. Si nce it s in ccption in 1975, thc 
dance progrCl m has not been widely recogni zed as 
the vital form of performing arts that it represents. 

It was ori gi nally part of the Phys ical Education 
Department. Dancers were forced to dance in the 
Old Gymnasium , in whi ch the floors were inappro-
priate for dance und freq uentl y cuused inj uri es. It 
did not receive academic status unt il 199 1 when 
the Dance Program was moved to the TheCJtre 
Department .. 

Now that dance has received it s own major and 
it s own facilit y, the program can continue to blos-
som and benefit students und the UCSD commu-
nity. 

It is refreshing to see UCSD allocate money to 
something other than science and engi neeri ng. The 
fine arts programs at UCSD arc a vital part of the 
university and deserve attention. Upgrading these 
programs in any Way possible is a thrilling ges ture, 
and allocating the Dance Progrum its own facility 
wus long overdue. 

Gov. Wilson's Education 
Efforts are Misguided 

Education was a bi g topi c in Gov. Pete 
Wilson 's eighth and final State of the State 
address last Wednesday in Sacramento. Many of 
the governor 's· solutions seem to be superficial 
cures for the woes of California' s publi c K- 12 
schools. 

Wil son criti cized proposals to remove the 
Scholastic Aptitude Test (S.A.T. ) as a criterion for 
admission to UC and CSU school s, calling the pro-
posal un "educati onal foll y." Wilson said that uni -
versity outrcach should be focused 0 11 S.A.T. 
preparati on. 

Wilson seems to forget that education is com-
prised of more thull simply tests. The S.A.T. does 
little more than assess a student 's tes t-taking abi li-
ty. Outreach should be geared toward making all of 

alifornia 's Citi zens li fe-long learners , not 
machines adept at taking u three-hour test. 

Wilson ulso proposed creating "opportun ity 
scholarships" for 15000 students "trapped in 
California's worst classrooms." These "scholar-
ships" are nothing more than school vouchers -
letting a privileged few Ilee from crumbling 
schools, leaving tens of thousands behind without 
any solutions to their problems. 

Some of what Wilson proposes are good ideas, 
including the California Virtual Uni versi ty, and 
forging ahead wit h U Merced. However, 
Wilson 's ideas concerning ou treach and K-12 edu-
cut ion leave much to be des ired. 

Instead of running away from the problem 
und lelling the politicians create superficial 
sol utions to educational ill s, the parents, stu -
dents and teachers of alifornia need to make a 
stand against the decuy of the state" education 
system.

GLOBAL WARMING CONFERENCE 
IGNORES SCIENTIFIC CONSENSUS 

COMMENTARY: Called to quell the mi sunderstood catastrophe known as 
Global Warming, the recent conference in Kyoto made few good resolutions 

C H R I S 
SCHREIBER 
My Biased Opinion 

There was an amazing conllucnce 
of myopic minds that occurred in Japan 
over the holidays while we students 
were all snugly at homc in our ro s~il ­
fuel healed houses, enjoyi ng Christmas 
wilh our fami lies. While we eagerl y 
awai ted Santa's arrival dow n our soot-

gagg le of inlcrnational hllrcaucrats 
galhered in Kyoto, Jap,,", to makc pro-
nouncements on the laiesl environmen-
tal boogie man: glohal warming. 

Of course, global Warming is Ihe 
latest hureaucrat ic hallie cry hecausc 
in the '70s thei>e sallie folks were 
warning of global cooling lind Ihe 
threat of an impending ice age . One 
~upposes it is casy enough to get the 
Iwo Ihings confused, cspeciall y if Ihe 
ellvironmcnlalists satislicd the normal 
international bureaucral job requi re-

. mcnts: l o~ mental acuity, reacti onary 
personality and an inexorable yearning 
to tell othcrs how to live. 

Given the people who callic togclh-
er to make the trealy, the result was 
foregone before Ihe conference cven 
started. The treaty prescribes cncrgy-
usc curhs (read: new taxcs) on the evi l 
developed counlri 's who fou led 
MOlhcr Gaia in their pursuil of mater-
ia l iTlammon and higher standards of 
li ving, while asking nOlhing of the 
poor. exploited developing world. 

Like most liberal panaceas, the 
trealy left much to be desired in bolh 
the scienlilic and logical areas . In the

ly shown that global warming is occur-

over the course of a 
century, would not 
destroy our 
civilization. 
ring. The whole global-warming panic 
rests upon compuler projection that 
assume weather is a linear sys tem and 
Ihat current trcnds will continue indef-
initely. Both assumptions arc flawed . 

Weather is nOI linear at all. Chaos 
theory, which states that minute 

~hangcs in initial conditions ~an cause 
huge changes in the final oulcome, 
cxp lains weal her pallerns mu~h belle I' 
Ihan linear models. In fact, weather is 
one of the more famous chaotic sys-
tems, as anyone who has heard the 
example of Ihe bUll ertl y in Beijing 
fl apping its wings am! causing a hurri-
~ anc in Miami can alLest. 

This is one of the rcasons Caplain 
Mike and the rest of the local weather 
forecasters cannot give accurate pre-
dictions of Ihe weather even a week 
ahead of time. Still, the bureaucrats 
want us all to believe their linear mod-

cis (whi ch, by the way, have nOI even 
come close to predicting the tempera-
tures we are currently experiencing) 
can predict, within the range of tenths 
of deg rees , what Ihe weather will be 
like 100 years from now. How gullible 
do Ihey think we arc? 

Additi onall y, Ihere is nothing d ose 
to Ihe scientific consensus claimed by 
the current adminislration that human 
activi ty is causing global warming. 
Among the sli ght majority of cli mate 
scientists who actuall y believe global 
warmi ng is occurring, only a small 
minority think that human acti vilY is 
causi ng it. 

This bri ngs us to Ihe second short-
fall of the Kyoto trealy: Its aUlhors 
assume the Ireaty 's pre criplions ~a n 
ali er any current pallerns of cooling or 
warming. Considcri ng the most ab un-
dant greenhouse gas, at over 95 per-

vapor, it ~e..:m~ hi ghl y unlike ly we can 
cllect any great changes by regulaling 
carbon di oxide cmiss ions from auto-
mobiles and r actorics. 

Additionally, even if such reg ula-
tion could effect the sort of changc Ihe 
myop ic burea ucrats envision, the 
structure dooms it to fai lurc. Lcaving 
ou t developing countries such as 
China and India, which have the high-
esl levels of increase in emission lev-
els, assures that cmissions levels 
wou ld probab ly still increase cv.:n if 
the trea ty were implemented today. 

Thc onl y thing the treaty wou ld

Guardian Sports to 
Focus on UCSD 
Editor: 

Mike Martinez wrole In the 
Dec . I issue an article with a valid 
concern . His piece titled "Mi Casa: 
Nonhem Cali Conspiracy Plots" 
poi nt s out a problem that has 
p l~ued the Guardian 's Sports sec-
tion for at least Ihe past live years 
(as long as I've been here). 

Spons opinion art ides 100 fre-

say s. Dr. Moore marshals hi storical 
and economic reasoning, as well as 
good old-fashioned common sense, 
to argue thai wanner could indeed 
be beller. 

The main economic argumenls 
in favor of warmer weather are 
lower heahh-~are costs and higher 
utility. Moore, ci ting studies pro-
duced by our own government 
back in the '70s when the boogie 
man was global cooling, claims 
that health care cosls would be $20 
bi Ilion less today if the temperature 
was 4.5 degrees Fahrenheit higher. 
A 4.5 degree Fahrenheit rai se is 
approximatcly what the naltering 
nabobs of global warming nega-
ti vism are predi~ling for 2050. 

Dr. Moore al so cl aims that 
American people wi ll be happier -

quen tly focus on profess ional 
sports. II doesn' t mallcr which par-
ti l.: ul ar ci ty - San Diego, San 
Francisco, or even Pittshurgh . The 
UCSD Guardiall is a newspaper for 
UCSD students and il should focus 
on jusl Ihat - UCSD Sports. 

If readers arc inlere ·ted in pro-
fessional spo rt s, the first place they 
are going to look for il is in a pro-
fessional ncwspaper. If readers are 
interested in SPOriS at UCSD, Ihey 
can ' t find that information in any 
profes ional publication. It is the 
GI/art/ian's responsibi lity 10 chal-
lenge ilse lf, its journalisti c abi lit ies 
and its readers to examine and 
investigate UCSD sports. 

As a member of a sport club on 
" un pus, I would like 10 sec an 
opinion arti cle which gives an in-

Ihat is they will ha ve highcr utililies 
- if they live in warmer weather. 
One of the ways he camc 10 Ihis 
conclusion was by measuring work-
ers' willingness 10 accept lower 
wages in order to tive in warmer cli -
mates. According to Dr. Moore's 
figures, workers would be willing 
to part wilh $30 to $100 billion in 
wages in exchange for weal her that 
was 4.5 degrees Fahrenheit warmer. 

Finally, Dr. Moore appeals to 
\:omrnon sense. Obviously, even a 
9-degree Fahrenheil change in the 
weal her, oc~urring gradually over 
Ihe course of a cenlury, would not 
destroy our civi lization. Industries 
and activi lies would adapi as neccs-
sary, and we would go on our way. 

Even the much hyped incrc<ls-
ing of the sea level would be a very 

deplh look al some 6f the non-
NCAA athletes on campus. Provide 
clubs wi th valuahlc publici ty while 
teaching the general student body 
something new and interesting 
abolll sports. 

The lirst CS D foo tball game 
since 1967. Ihat happened two 
weekends ago, is probably a good 
place to slart . How allout an article 
on the archery clull, Ihe hadminton 
scene or an uhimale di sc player 
proli le'? These are examples or 
educational and investigative jour-
nalism that we, as students, should 
expec t at our uni versi ty. 

Mike Martinez's article poinls 
out a valid problem. I hope Ihis 
response poinls out an appropriate 
so lution.

gradual prol:ess with which we 
wou ld not have very much lrouble 
coping. Certain low-lyi ng third 
world counlrics might have Irou-
ble, bUI we could easi ly come up 
with ways to help them out for far 
tess ex pense than would be 
required if we implemented , the 
Kyoto provisions. 

Hopefully, the conferees at 
Kyoto had fun, because they cer-
tainly produced nothing of value 
during thei r time in Japan. 
However, there is one good use to 
the studies and treaty provisions 
from Kyoto, now that they have cu t 
down all those trees to print Ihem

CEREMONY: 
Building intended as 
a "temple" to dancers 
Continued from pace 1 
wall that opens the building to the 
main campus and the Mande ll 
Wei ss Forum and Theatre. 

The fac ility also features aper-
tures in the arching wall that allow 
natural ventilation and light into 
the studios, fl oor-to-ceiling win-
dows, basket weave floors, 
acoustical iso lation of the studios, 
and spacious shower and locker 
rooms. 

Predock, an award-wi nning 
architc(;t, referred to hi s new facili -
ty as a temple created speci ticall y 
for the dan(;crs. 

The design is "a dance on the 
site .. . an impulse toward move-
ment where the dynamic tension 
between the building ami its site 
echoes the choreographic re!a-
tion ship between dancers ," 
Predock said . "It 's about dance 
and space, which is a spiritual 
connec tion ... 

Several guests at the opening 
said they enjoyed the exhibition 
of the creatively designed build -
ing. 

"I particularly like the config-
uration and different shapes of 
the windows," said former UCSD 
dance instru (; tor Colleen 
Shipkowski . "Our soc iety is fair-
ly linear, but if dancers are sur-
rounded by different types of 
designs, it 's easier for them to 
create. " 

Prior to the completion of the 
Dance Studio Facility, the dance 
program shared part of the Main 
Gym with the physical education 

department. According 10 
Margareue Marshall , dance pro-
gram director and instructor, the 
conditions of the facility wcre 
confined and unsafe for the 
dancers. 

' 'The dancers were gelling too 
many injuries, such as sprained 
ankles and shin splints, from such 
poor Hoors," Marshall said . 

Through a long process of 
petitioning, Marshall spea rhead-
ed the campaign for a beller 
fa ci lity. 

In response to the administra-
ti on's refusa l to remode l the 
Main Gym, students wrote letters 
to then-
C han ce llor 
Rich ar d 
Atkinson and the 
vice chance llors. 
They also held 
classes ou tside 
of Atkinson's 
offic e to gain 
re(;ognition for 
the dance pro-
gram 's needs. 

According to 
Mar s h a ll , 
Atkinson dec ided 
to allocate an 
additional $1.5 
million (for a total 
of $3 million) to 
build a new facili -
ty in response to

mony, including faculty, al umn i

Marshall described Tuesday's 
opening as a long-awaited milestone 
for the future of UCSD dance. 

''Today 's opening was such a

FLU: Students 
should wash their 
hands to be safe 
Continued from pace 1 
myth that co ld and rai ny weather 
makes people sick is not exactly 
true. 

"The only thing about the 
weather that affect il is that we 
come indoors and are closer 
around each other rather than being 
in an open space," she said. "In bad 
weather, we're all indoors" 

Hendrickson also said that stu-
dents who received flu shots earli -
er this year have a beller chance of 
avoiding the flu . The influenza 
vacc ine immunizes recipients 
against the three types of flu vi rus-
es that Centers For Disease 
Control And Prevention (CDC) 
scientists think will be most preva-
lent during the upcoming season. 

''The tlu shot definitely helps 
because there's going to be more 
than one strain of nu that people 
are sick with here," Hendrickson 
said . ''There's going to be several , 
and the more common ones are 
going to be the ones that are cov-
ered by the CDC. It 's proven to be 
true in the past and I don 't think it 
will really be different this year. 

' 'Those people that have got-
ten their ilu shots will statisti cally 
definitely not get the tlu or have a 
reduced case with those three 
influenzas," she added. 

Hendrickson said that student 
who have fevers over 101 °F 
should not attend classes. Also, in 
order to avoid catching a tlu or 
cold, students should wash their 
hands frequently and avoid large 
groups of people. 

Thursday, Ianuary IS, 1998 

"Our natural habit is to put our 
hands near our mouth and eyes, 
our mucous membranes, and 
that 's how we transmit these 
things from our hands to our bod-
ies," she said. "It's important to 
do frequent hand washing and to 
avoid large collections of people 
when you don ' t have to [be 
among theml ." 

According to Shumaik, com-
plications of the flu virus include 
pneumonia, meningiti s and dehy -
dration. He stressed that people 
should not go to an emergency 
room unless they are experienc-
ing severe symptoms. 

"They shouldn ' t go at all 
unless they have shortness or 
breath or they' ve got a terrible 
headache and they' re vomiting or 
they ' re dehydrated, " he said. 

Shumaik also sa id that antibi -
otics will not help people aftlicted 
with cold and Ilu viruses. 

Revelle Junior Gwen Shores, 
who is just beginning to develop 
symptoms of the flu, said she leels 
like she just hasn't been able to fully 
recover from the flu this season. 

"It 's like I never really heal," 
she said. 'T II start to feel beller 
but then I'll get sick agai n. No 
one's healing, we' re all just pass-
ing it on to each other. " 

Shumaik sa id that there is no 
way of knowing whether emer-
gency rooms will be filled with 
Ilu sufferers in the near future. 

"You can't really track what's 
going to happen," he said. "Over 
the holidays there was a big rush 
and none of the emergem;y 
departments are seeing the num-
bers they were seeing then. So, 
whether it 's truly ove r, we don ' t 
know. It could be."

DEATH: Suicide 
level is 1 in 25 for 
Las Vegas visitors 
Continued from page 1 
re 'ult s would he aCl:urute. they 
Wilt ro lled li)r age, race, sex and 
state or res idence. 

"This study shuws that it i., not a 
w incidence that Las Vegas, the 
premier gambling ccnh: r in the 
U.S., displays the hi gh~s t suicide 
I..:vcls in the nation huth for vi sitors 
and residents," Phillips sa id. 

According to th~ study's 
authors, tht: average national sui-
cide leve l for out-of-sta te vi sitors 
was .97 per(;ent , or one death per 
100 tourists. Las Vegas, however, 
had a suicide level of 4.28 perl:ent, 
or one death in 25 - more than 
four times the national average. 
Reno and Atlantic City also had 
unusuall y high suicide leve ls, 2.31 
percent and 1.87 perl:ent, respec-
ti vely. 

The study also compares suicide 
leve ls in Atlantic City before and 
after 1978, the year gambling was 
legali zed in New Jersey. Prior to 
the lega li zati on of gambling, 
Atlantic Ci ty had sui cide levels 
consistent with the national aver-
age. Arter 197!:!, the sui cide levels 
of both visitors and residents rose 
to abnormally high leve ls. 

This before-and-after type of 
evaluation cannot be performed for 
Reno and Las Vegas because gam-
bling was instituted in Nevada 
bel'ore data on suicides was avail-
able. 

The resean:hers emphasi zed 
that the study does not conclusive-
ly prove that a link exists between 
legalized gambling and high sui-
cide rates; it only suggests statisti-
cally that gi\ lllbling is linked to 
large nu mbers of suicides. The sta-
ti stics may instead show an indirect 
link between gambling and sui cide. 

"We know that people in des-
perate economic cin:umstam:es arc 
morc likely to commit suicide, and 
we also know that gamb ling is 
assOI.:i'lted wi th desperate econoJn-
k circumstances." Phillips said . 
"These findings might suggest that 
not just gamblers, but other groups 
including spou 'es, chi Idren and rel-
atives of gamblers. could also 
experience elevated risks of sui-
cide." 

Phillips declined to take a posi-
tion on whether gambling should 
be legal. 

"The point of thi s study was not 
to say whether there should or 
should not be gambling," he said . 
"The point was to provide evidence 
that would be useful in the debate 
over gambling."

tons of martial-art fi ght scenes and blood-and-gore

films than Woo and Chan. 

A Hong Kong cult favorite is director Lam, who 
produced great action films such as "City on Fire" 
and "Prison on Fire." 

Lam is Woo's counterpart ; instead of Woo's 
dramati c, high-nying stunt action, Lam's action 
scenes are surrea l. His vi sual imagination rather 
than great stunts is what makes hi s movies work, 
and hi s character 's are not a nat as Woo's tend to 
be. There is no di stinct good guy or bad guy, but

By S .. n Rahim! 
Senior Staff Writer 

They say familiarity breeds complacency. In 
the case of "The Boxer," a poignant love story 
from acclaimed tllmmaker Jim Sheridan, famili ar-

The fi lm reunites writer-director Sheridan with 
Daniel Day-Lewis after 

dan and company produce some of the most rea l-
istic boxing sequences since Robert De Niro's per-
formance in "Raging Bull." Known for hi s dedica-

honing his boxing skills under McGuian, and it 
shows.

All Bark, No Bite 

Hoffman and De Niro team up in new 
political comedy 'Wag The Dog' 

By Asaph Amlr 
Guardian Reporter 

direclor. Acting in w llusion, Ihey 
produce desired public opinion on 
demand and manufacture nalional 
sentiment. Their objective is to 
di rect a contri ved war, thus dis-
tracting allention from a high-level 
sex scanda l and wi n Ihe election for 
thei r hoss, Ihe president of the 
United Slatcs. 

A black comedy starri ng Dustin 
Hoffman and Robert De N i ro, 
New Line Cinema's "Wag The 
Dog" is full of wry humor and 
uncompromising irony. Hoffman 
plays hi s ro le with great ski ll in 
yel another vi rtuoso performance. 
f he fi lm has some hil arious 
comedic riffs, including a pervert-
ed cameo by Woody Harre lson 
and a deadpan appearance by the 
perennial country-western hippie, 
Willie Nelson. 

The few merils of "Wag The 
Dog," however, fail to compensate 
for its major naws. The main prob-
lem is that Hoffman's character is 
Ihe only one that is well·defined. 
De Niro adopts a low-key posture, 
which fails to contribute positively 
10 this film . The result is a large ly 
Jull and tedious film, with no strik-
Ing dialogue. 

A redeeming merit of the film 
is that Ihe president himself is 
made invisible in "Wag The Dog." 
Thus, the supposed sanitized and 
representative image of the Oval 
Office is symbolically distanced 
from the covert and manipulative 
campaign machine, the subject of 
the film. 

Courtesy of New Une Cinema/Phil Caruso 
... Trip: Dustin Hoffman stars as an eccentric film producer who wants the credit for creating the 
biggest masterpiece of his career in New Line Cinema 's comedy · Wag the Dog. " 

Director Barry Levinson hardly 
.lspires 10 the entertai nmenl qual i-
.ies of his best films like "Good 
Morning Vietnam" :lnd "Rain 
Man." The star allraction fails to 
li ve up 10 its potenlial . Panially due 
10 poor directing, ,De Niro and 
Hoffman share no substantial or 
powerful cenes. 

The film 's producers printed a 
se lf-congratulatory note during Ihe 
end credits about their speedy one-
month completion of principal 
shooting. The standard for Holly-
wood film shooling is three 
months. However. this achieve-
ment is modest when considering 
the relalive simplicity of this pro-
duction that has virtually no special 
effec ts or location shots. 

James Ca meron's "Titanic" 
highlighted its high costs on the 
final print, whereas "Wag The 
Dog" merely highlights it s own 
low budget. 

In "Wag The Dog," Hoffman is 
l Hollywood producer and De Ni ro

"Wag The Dog" is currentl y 
playi ng in theaters Ihroughout San

-------'-----...Album Review§s-------

JoIIrne,..n 
National Hijinx 
"'_1 __ '-
-••• 

Journey man's second album, 
National Hij inx, takes on the 
admirable qualities of a film 
soundtrack with its bizarre sam-
ples, sli ck drum breaks and orc hes-
tral melodies. On a first li sten, 
however, what is most noticeable 
are the album's fast and furious 
beats. 

With their pairing of female 
voca ls and rich strings, Journey -
man 's work recall s the thematic 
styles of Porti shead and Sky lab 
- parti cularly on tracks li ke 
"Spy" and "Eugolana Box." 
What sets Journeyman apart from 
trip-hoppers, however, is their 
adept se nse of rhythm. The 
rhythm is built up in tranquil 
melodies and see ms 10 creep oul 
of nowhere. 

The album's first track , 
"National Hijinx," takes a surpris-
ing tum, as it rips in and out of a 
shuftling drum loop. On "National 
Hijinx 2" and "Sloath," Journey-
man utili ze choppy and shifting 
beats, often referred to as "dri II . n 
bass." 

Journey man's Paul Frankland, 
with his eclec tici sm, comes 
through on National Hijinx. This 
ec lecticism will also be featured 
on a handful of upcomi ng projects 
- including a remi x of it Coidcul 
si ngle.

Mmillea 
Re-Load 

-
-•• 

Metallica continue to redefine 
themselves, for beller or worse, as 
they return with their seventh full-
length album, Re-Load. The new 
record is intended as a continuation 
of last year's multi -platinum Load, 
bearing a similar sound' but clearly 
attempting to experiment more 
with the musi c. 

Fans of old Metallica, who were 
dismayed by the softer, more (;001-
mercial nature of Load and 1992's 
Metallica, will find no so lace in the 
76 minutes of Re-Load. 

The band 's distim;ti ve guitar 
ri ffs and thrashy tempos I hat 
defined the metal genre in the 
'80s are still absent - in their 
place are unu sual chord voicings 
and an increased emphasis on 
voca ls. 

Re-Load excels lyrically, dis-
cussing themes ranging from 
addi ction ("Fixxxer") to the obliga-
tory sa tanic tune ("Dev il 's 
Dance"). 

In "Carpe Diem Baby," which at 
times comes out sounding like a 
motivational speech, voca li stl 
rhythm guitari st James Hetfield 
reyeals what may be the 010110 
behind Metallica's 17-year career: 
"Break Ihe rule/Live to win/Dare to 
rai I." 

In a nutshell , if you didn't like 
Load, you won 't like Re-Load. 

- Matthew Kalinowski 

DJSIuIdow 
Preemptive Strike 

... -

-••• 

When the general public's expo-
sure to hip-hop is limited to the 
likes of Pu ff Daddy and hi s cronies, 
it is refreshing to see that true 
artists like the Bay Area's OJ Shad-
ow arc keepin ' it real, so to speak. 

In many ways, OJ Shadow 
embodies the sample-based, turntable 
al1istry behind hip-hop, conglomerat-
ing obscure and innumerable bilS into 
epic and original songs. 

On Preemptive Srrike, a collec-
tion of earlier singles and remixes, 
DJ Shadow demonstrates the skills 
which sct his music apan from that 
of most hip-hop arti sts. Pieci ng 
together samples of thundering 
drums, funky basslines, piano and 
keyboard oUllakes, jazzy riffs and 
carryi ng a melody with flui d 
turntab le scratches is no si mp le 
feal , but DJ Shadow manages 10 
accomplish it both smoolhly and 
aesthetica lly. 

Underneath Preemptive Strike's 
noisier parts lies a sultry and cohe-
sive ambience whi ch holds the oth-
erwise unbalanced pieces together. 
In this area, DJ Shadow's experi-
mental nature - which often elim-
inates traditional notions of rap-
ping, rhyming and matching beats 
- is wildly successful.

14 HIATUS The UCSD Guardian Thursday, January IS, 1998 

By Brendan Cahill 
Senior Staff Writer 

There are five goth/industrial clubs in San 
Diego: Club Retro. Soil, Therapy, Under-
world, and Vortex . (Room 13 is on hiatus for 
now. and though Warsaw may be reappear-
ing, it is currently out of comission). Four of 
these five clubs are put on by DJ Bl)'an Pol-
lard. So. looking for a 

fun , that's really all that counts. 
Do you ever notice a flux in p0pu-
larity of the scene or the clubs? 

Just because of school and work. We see 
more people in the summer and around holi -
days. But otherwise, no; it stays pretty con-
stant. We have people who have been coming 
for years and years. We lose people, but we 

get new ones. [love 
bit of insight into the 
local scene, I went 
early to Club Retro 
(when it was still Club 
'80s) to chat with the 
man · a bit before the 
evening started. 

Pollard is a very nice guy 
and puts on a great show, 
so do yourself a favor and 

new faces , people 
new to the scene. 
Some people come in, 
like the club, and 
come back without 
changing - they just 
look like themselves 

(orne to one of his clubs. 
Pollard is a vel)' 

nice guy and puts on a great show, so do yourself 
a favor and corne to one of his clubs. It's always 
a good time, and besides, he loves new faces. 

Pollard puts on Club Retro (playing new 
wave, goth and pop; Thursday, 'Canes in 
Mission Beach, 488-1780), Therapy (indus-
trial , dark wave, ret ish and goth; Friday, Min-
istl)' Nightclub across from the Sports Arena. 
223-5598}_ Underworld (industrial, dark-
wave, fetish and goth; Sunday, Emerald City 
in Pacific Beach, 483-9920) and Vortex 
(industrial. darkwave, fetish and goth, the 
third Saturday of evel)' month - ne)(t event 
Jan. 17 - Harvest Nights at the Point Lorna 
Quality Inn 224-3655). 
GUllrdlan: How Ionl have you been 
DJing? 

Bryan: I've been doing it my whole life. 
If you mean when I started getting paid to 
OJ, I was 15. 
How long have you been doing 
lothllndustrial? 

I started out doing punk, but back then 
everything was punk. When Alien Sex Fiend 
came out. they were called a punk band. [t 
wasn ' t until more recently that things got 
crossed over and different facets came out. 
This sort of goth constituency has a 
reputation for snobbishness - has 
this chanaed much over the years? 

I think the younger crowd is too con-
cerned with how you look. A lot or them will 
stand around and say "he's not goth enough." 
I prefer that people Iwho come to the clubs] 
dress more fetish, but that 's just me - just 
my personal opinion. I'm not going to be one 
to dictate what people wear. If they ' re having 

- but some people 
come once and then come back with all the 
vinyl and stuff. 
What are the advantages of the 
San Dieco club scene? 

San Diego has its good points. I think 
there's a lot of authentic music here. Also. 
we're one of the only cities where the clubs 
really play requests. I mean, you make a 
request in an L.A. club - you ' re not going 
to hear it. We have the request sheets and we 
really try to playa lot of requests. 
What are the diudvantages? 

It 's harder in San Diego lthan elsewhere I 
to get a license for an 18-and-up club or to get 
an after-hours license. [ think there's also a lot 
of gossip in San Diego. A lot of people who 
have only been around three or four months 
start talking shit to build themse lves up. Itl)' 
to keep myself out of it - I mean, I' m 35, I 
don't want to get into any cliques. 
Why are so many clubs are 21· 
and·up? 

Wristbands are a pain, and it just makes it 
easier. San Diego has a strong vice and I'm not 
going against them. Having it 21-and-up keeps it 
simple. Also, I would say 25 percent of my reg-
ulars would stop coming if it were 18-and-up. 
What do you think are the 
strengths and weaknesses of 
these clubs? 

I think we put on some of the few clubs 
that play new music. I mean. if you just ~ant 
to listen to Ihe same old music you 've had in 
your collection, just put on the CD at home 
before you come 10 the club. So we try to 
playas much new music as we can . Of 
course we play old music too.

The Carnival Arrives 
The Fugees'Wyc/ef Jean brings his solo act to town 

By Sean Rahimi 
Senior Staff Writer 

On the eve of the release or his debut 
solo album on RuffllOuse/Columbia 
Records, The Fugees' Wyclef Jean appears 
ready to take hip-hop to the next level. 
Wyclef lean PreJelllS The Camival is, for 
all intents and purposes, 'Clef's fulfillment 
of hip-hop's "nex t level" prophecies. For 
now, his next step is to take to the stage, 
something he will do Jan . 20 at 4th & B in 
downtown San Diego. 

Blunted on Reality, The Fugees 
(Rcfugee Camp) debut effort - largely an 
angry album refl ecting the hard times of 
growing up in the ghettos of New Jersey 
and Brooklyn - gained critical acclaim but 
failed to reap rewards in the marketplace. 

Not pleased with the sound of the 
album, Jean took the helm of wnstructing 
The Fugees' nex t offeri ng. The result was 
the multi -platinum sophomore set The 
Score, which sold II million-plus copies 
worldwide. The international success of 
The Score gave Jean a chance to rest, but 
Tire Camival clearly shows that he is only 
beginning to flex his artistic muscle. 

Stunningly autobiographical, The Car-
nival grew out of the The Fugees' hectic 
world-tour schedule. Hoping not to fa!1 into 
the rehashed scenario of a commercially-
successful artist trying to recapture ghetto-
glory and street-credibility, Jean embraces 

ACTION: 
Hong Kong imports 
satisfy in U.S, 
Continued from page 8 
a complex formula of "what is good and 
what is bad." For example. Lam 's movie 
"Full Contact" revolves around the theme 
of bet·rayal. 

Another side to Hong Kong films is 
their popular ghost slOries, which would 
most likely make up the other 20 percent of 
the Hong Kong film genre. 

A harmless one to recommend is "Mid-
night I O'c lock." directed by Wai -Shun 
Yip. It is a collection of three slOries all 
occurring around midnight. The film is 
somewhat slow but makes up for in its 
humor. As an additional bonus, audiences 

his heritage at a c'lreer point where all toO 
many artists become lax in the wake of 
global prominence. 

Tire Carnival's four Creole numbers dis-
play Jean's diversity as he cries out against 
the misguided climate of his homeland, 
Haiti. "Sang Fezi" is a hip-hopping freestyle 
assault of Haitian pride. "Jaspora" and 
"Yele" are moving, reggae-influenced num-
bers, while "Carnival" is the quintessential 
kompas (the type of music to pack the dance 
floor of any Caribbean affair). 

Tracks like the bouncy and infectious 
"Anything can Happen"; the moving "Gone 
Till November," composed by Jean and in 
which he conducted the 62-piece New York 
Philharmonic Orchestra; and the huge hit 
"Guantamera," a remake of the Afro-
Caribbean folk staple, give The Carnival a 
unique and diversified sound. 

The Carnival hits home on numbers like 
the elegiac "Gun Powder," where Jean 
retells the Carnival murder of his cousin 
who spoke out against the social injustices 
practiced by Haiti's then-ruling body, and 
"Bubblegoose" which recounts an incident 
where he lost another two cousins to gun-
fire . 

In the wake of The Score's success, Jean 
has done well not to fall into the trap or rest-
ing on his laurels, but he must now contin-
ue to evolve and take his music to a higher 
level. 

can sec three famous Hong Kong stars: 
Veronica Yip, Anita Yuen and lord!!n Chan. 

As a warning: if one decides to seek OUI 
more Hong Kong horror films, be fore-
warned. they are not for the faint of heart. 
Some may conlain victims being strangled 
by their own entrails (a popular shot) or 
phantasmal torture scenes Hong Kong is 
infamous for. 

On a lighter note, an up-and-coming 
Taiwanese film director, Ang Lee, has been 
making some headway into American 
mainstream and may be worth check ing 
out. 

One or his recent lilms is "Sense and 
Sensibility." starring Emma Thompson and 
Hugh Grant. He also did a string of very 
good Taiwanese movies inc1uLling, 'The 
Wedding Banquet" and "Eat Drink Man 
Woman."

UCSD Sports Clubs Round-Up 
SKDNG 

How does a six-hour-plus drive sound every 
other weekend '? For most of us it sounds, well, long. 
However, for the 28 members of the UCSD colle-
giate ski and snowboard team, the drive to 
Mammoth mountain is worth it - especially last 

Long Beach. 

weekend 's trip . 
On Saturday, the UCSD 

men ' ski squad braved the 
gusting winds and placed 
fifth overall against teams 
from UCLA, USC, San 
Diego State University, UC 
Santa Barbara and CSU 

Ryan Broner, Robert Uholm and Seth Delackner 
finished 21 st. 23rd and 24th, respectively. 

The UCSD men 's snowboarding team also did 
well. Members of the team charged down the 
course for an overall third-place finish on Saturday 
in the giant slalom as Chris Yokoyama shined for 
UCSD in the OS with a sixth-place finish. 

On Sunday, with the snow still dumping and vis-
ibility at a minimum, both the two-plankers and 
snowboarders switched from the GS to the slalom. 
UCSD men's ski continued to hang tough with 
another lifth-place tinish. Men's snowboarding 
jumped a spot, improving to a second-place finish 
in the slalom. Individually, Chad Yates tinished in 
second place, the strongest placing for UCSD. 

Although the men did surprisingly well, the 
story of the weekend came from the women. UCSD 
women's ski had a solid third-place finish on 
Saturday in the giant slalom and an outstanding sec-
ond place in the slalom on Sunday. 

Highlights from Saturday's giant slalom were 
Windy Davis, who placed eighth, Sunshine Allison, 
who finished 10th, and Allison Cummings in 11th. 

"You know we're from San Diego. [and] not 
expected to do so well on the snow, but we do do 
snow, and we do it well," Cummings said. 

- John Maynard 

ICE HOCKEY 
"Blame it on the rain" - one of the greatest songs 

of our generation. Whoever Milli Vanilli truly was, 
they sure could sing a good tune. and what amazing 
dancers! Their song is one that comes to mind when 
looking at the UCSD hockey team's recent game 

against Cal State Long 
Beach. a 6-0 loss. 

As the stonny weather 
succeeded in keeping 
UCSD fans from attending, 
the UCSD hockey team 
was getting rained on by an 
explosive CSU Long Beach 

team at the San Diego Ice Arena. Long Beach has 
given UCSD hockey fits in the past, as shown by 
UCSD's 0-1-3 lifetime record against Long Beach. 

UCSD came out strong, and was able to hold 
Long Beach from scoring for most of the lirst period. 
However, after Long Beach scored its first goal, this 
young and ineKperienced UCSD team seemed to lose 
its poise. Down 1-0, UCSD began to make mistakes 
and gave up too many power plays to Long Beach. 

Long Beach controlled the momentum of the 
game with its aggressive play and precise passing. 

One bright spot for the UCSD squad was the 
play of goalie Derek Stainer. Stainer, who received 
little help from his defense, was able to save 44 of 
the 50 shots fired at him throughout the night. 

''The players went into the game expecting to 
win, but didn 't come out ready to play," team cap-
tain Bhavin Mehta said. 'This is the best team we 
have had in three years, we are just unable to put it 
all together (;ome game time." 

UCSD is 1-4-0 for the season but Mehta believes 
things are looking up. 

"Going undefeated for the rest of the season is 
entirely possible," Mehta said. 

The UCSD pu(;ksters will next travel to the Irvine 
ke Arena to play UC Irvine before retuming to San 
Diego to host CSU Northridge on Fri ., Jan. 23.

It was Davis' call to fire another

Shanahan, in 1990. Poor Shanahan

being fired by the Raiders. He's

It was Davis' call to disrespect 

Marcus Allen - easily one of the 
top-five running backs of all time. 
[n 1994, Allen's last season as a

Most appalling, however, was 
Davis' decision to move the 
Raiders back to Oakland in 1995. 
Who the hell moves a team back to 
the city they moved out of! 

Davis, a tyrannical despot in his 
own right, rules the Raiders with an 
iron fist. Vince Lombardi could 
coach this team and still not satisfy 
Davis. Now that the Raiders are 
indescribably bad, enough so that 
they're gelling the fourth pick in

Davis is the virus eating this team

oItI FOIU"· PORTS - DenniS Mille" on AI Davis 

Whale 
of a Tale 

Jonah Freedman 
AI's Silver & Black 
Heart Attack 

It's great to see tradition bro-
ken in any form , but it 's espe-
cially great to see a team in tur-
moil that deserves it more than 
0.1. deserves a beating. The 
Oakland Raiders - that team of 
tradition, the Silver and Black 
Attack - are in the worst rut of 
their existence. 

After a 4- 12 Iinish, the 
team 's worst in 25 years, and 
the recent tiring of yet another 
coacb, there are lingers pointing 
in this mess of a franchise . 

Actually, there 's just one tin-
ger to point - at a stodgy. stuh-
born, biller-ass man named AI 
Davis. "Sweet AI" has maneu-
vered this once-grea t team 
directly into the crapper, almost 
systematically. What is it about 
AI that continues the tradition of 
the Raiders ' "Commitment to 
Excrement"'! 

On Jan. 6, Davis fired Head 
Coach Joe Bugel, the Raiders' 
third coach in three seasons. 
Bugel was hailed by team mem-
bers as the "p/ayers' coach," and 
his hiring came at the recom-
mendation of the entire team 
after last year's firing of 1996 
Head Coach Mike White. 

Was Bugel to blame for the 
Raiders' dismal season'? Of 
course not. The Raiders were in 
the toilet long before Bugel was 
given the job. The team has no 
leaders. no heart and, aside from 
Pro Bowlers Tim Brown and 
Napoleon Kaufman, no poten-
tial to succeed. 

A recent ESPN SportsZone 
Internet poll asked web-surfers 
who is to hlame for the demise 
of the Raiders. Sixty-three per-
cent answcred Davi s, while 
another 25 percent blamed the 
players. Only 12 percent point -
ed to Bugel as the culprit. 

Now Davis has scheduled 
meetings with former Raiders' 

, coach and current At lanta 
Falcon offensive line coach Art 
Shell, Minnesota Vikings Head 
Coach Dennis Green. New York 
Jets defensive coordinator Bill 
Belichick and Philadelphia 
Eagles o)'fensi ve coordi nator 
Jon Gruden. All these men have 
been rumored as potentials to 
take over the reins in Oakland. 

In my opinion, anyone who 
takes this job is a fool. Davi~ 
runs the team, not the coach. 
Any controversial call will be 
made by Davis and only by 
Davis. 

It was Davi~' ca ll to run Shell 
lUt of hi ~ head-coaching job in 
1995. I can't understand why. In

Tritons, Prepare To Qualify 
NATIONALS: The UCSD swim team is 100lUng ahead to the 
second half of the season and its annual charge into the postseason 
By Jacob Gordon 
Staff Writer 

Wrinkled prune hands, eye~ red from ch lo-
rine, hai r so briule it breaks when you touch 
it ,and laps, laps and more laps. The UCSD swim 
team works as hard as any sports team on cam-
pus and recently its hard work paid off in a big 
way. 

In early December, the team traveled to Long 
Beach to compete in the Speedo Cup, the tirst 
real chance for it s swimmers to qualify for the 
Division III 'ati onal Championships in March. 

With the men 's and women's teams only 
improving on the heels of last year's second-
and th.ird-place Iinishes in Nationals, this meet 
was a stepping stone to poss ibly another great

lini sh in thi s year's CAAs. 
When all was said and done in Long Beach. 

the Tritons had another strong showing. Of the 
30 swimmer th at allempted to qualify for 
nationals, 25 of them reached their goal. 

On the men 's side, many swimmers put in 
excellent performances including sophomore 
Mall Payne, who qualified for Nationals while 
breaking hi s own school records in both the 100-
and 200-meter breast troke. 

Senior Tim McAteer qualified for Nationals 
in three events, the 200-, 500- and 1650-meter 
freestyle . McAteer finished an incredible sec-
ond in the 1650 despite the tough Division J 
competition . 

Sophomore Jason Boettner, last year's fre 'h-
man sensation, started strongly again this season 
qualifying for the 200,500 and 1650 as well. 

Senior Ed Ruth qualified 
for two events, including 
recording a lifetime best in the 
200-meter hreaststroke. 

Junior co llege transfer 
Marc Latronica also qualified 
in three events, 100- and 200 -
meter bUllertly and the 200-
meter backstroke. 

The women turned in a 
slew of good times. Junior Kelly Byrne, who 
won NCAAs in the 200 breaststroke her fresh -
man year, turned in another fantastic time in that 
event at the Cup and qualified for the third 
straight year. She also qualified in the 400-meter 
individual medley. 

Shawna Caballero, 1997's UCSD co-swim-
mer of the year, continued the Tritons strong 
performance with qualifying times in both the 
50 and 100 freestyle . 

Allison Leppke put in a good long-distance 
performance as she qualified for the 1650 and 
freshman Danielle Kidston recorded superb 
times in the 100 and 200 backstroke. 

All in all, everyone on both the men's and 
women's teams turned in great performances, 
attributed by many swimmers to the great team 
unity of the Tritons. Coach Doug Boyd's philos-
ophy is for the whole team to work together, 
even in a port as individual as swi mming. 

"It 's more important for us to be together as 
a group than it is for us to have five great swim-
mers and have them not be 19roup-orientedJ ," 
Boyd said. "You only win in sports by havi ng 
your lower level rise 10 the top and unless they 
feci like they are part of the whole thing, it 's not 
goi ng to work" 

As the Tritons look forward to a quick seven-
hour trip to Tempe, Ariz. thi s weekend to rac 
Division I powerhouse Arizona State Univer ·ity. 
Latronica has a simplified approach to success. 

"This trip to ASU is going to be a whole lot 
of fun and when people are having fun they just 
swim better," Latronica said. 

Let 's hope the Tritons keep having fun all the 
way to the NCAAs.

By Steve Walsh 
Senior Staff Writer 

The gauntlet has been thrown 
for the 1998 U SD men 's vo lley-

banner of thei r own. 

The Tritons have a 
clo 'e tie to the champi-
onship in Hcad oach

coache ' both the men's 
and women's teams. In
