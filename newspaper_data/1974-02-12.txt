UC Investments Attacked Third College Program 
by Chris Rauber 

The University of California's policy concerning its 
financial investments has come under heavy fire 
recently for lack of social responsibility. 

U. C. Regent William Matson Roth, Assemblyman 
John Du nlap (Napa County) , and the U.c. Student 
lobby have attacked the University for its implicit 
support of South Africa's apartheid system, and its 
automatic pro-management stan e in corporate proxy 
fights . 

A cording to John Harrington, Dunlap 's Ad-
ministrative Aide and author of "U.c. Investments: 
Racist or Respon ible?", U.S. muki-national cor-
porations help perpetuate institutionalized racism in 
outh Africa with their inve tm nts. "T he University of 

California," he points out, "presently holds an in-
vestment portfolio of over a billion dollars. Thirty-two 
per cent is held in firms which operate and receive large 
profits from , and economi ally support racist-ruled 
outh Africa." 

outh Africa's apartneid system enforces strict racial 
segregation and limits theeconomic and social mobility 
of bla ks, who receive only 18.8 percent of their 
nation's cash income although they compri e 70 per-
cent of the population . The United Nations has called 
apartheid "a th reat to internationa I peace and security." 

In corporate fights over social responsibility issues 
last year, U.c. cast pro-management proxy votes against 
proposals that I.T.T. be politically nonpartisan, that 
I.B.M . disclose the amount of wages paid to black and 
white employees in South Africa, and that Ford Motor 
Co. be required to describe new air pollution control 
and vehicle safety measures and minority hiring 
practices. The pro-management positions were taken 
a.utomatically, wittrout full discussion, by the Board of 
Regents . 

William Roth and fellow U .c. Regent William 
Coblentz feel that corporations have an obligation to 

operate with in certain social gu idelines, and that the 
University sh ou Id use its votes in corpora te proxy fights 
to see to it that the gu idelines are observed. 

Roth, a Democratic candidate for the gubernatorial 
nomination, insists that the Board of Regents consider 
the social, as well as the financial , implications of its 
investments . 

Speaking for the opposing viewpoint, held by a 
majority of the Regents, Regent Chairman Dean A. 
Watkins laims that, "i n the end it gets down to the 
prudent management of the investments of the 
University, with an eye to maximum return Once we 
begin applying somebody's idea of morality or social 
good, I don't know where we would ~top ." In other 

. words, the prime con ideration for inve tments i the 
ecurity and amount of return . Watkin ays he is 

" atisfied with the exi ting pol icy ." 
A propo al which would have allowed any Regent to 

bring any proxy issue related to matters of corporate 
o ial re ponsibility before a meeting in public session, 
ubmitted on October 10 by U.c. President Charles 

Hitch, was reje cted by the Board . Hitch's reque t that 
the Regents ubscribe to the Investor Re earch Center, a 
non1Jrofit organization that provides impartial analy i 
of proxy issues for S5,<X>O a year, was al 0 reje ted. 

Assemblyman Dunlap's AB 974, which would 
mandate that tate proxy votes take a neutral position 
on matters of social responsibility, is currently under 
consideration in Sacramento. 

Joining the dissenting Regents and A emblyman 
Dunlap, the Santa Barbara chapter of the U .c. tudent 
lobby has created the People's Coalition for Investor 
Responsibility to oppose the present U.c. inve tment 
policy . Spokesman Mike Clough has denounced the 
Regents, claiming that " the Univer ity inve tment 
policies blatantly contradict the Regent ' moral 
tatements . It is hypncrisy in the fir t degreE' " 

Aids For Tests 
by John Taylor 

A tutorial program 
designed to assist minority 
students in the art of taking 
the all-important Medical 
College Admis ions Test 
(MCA T) is now in its second 
year at Third College. 

Traditionally , these 
students don't produce the 
usual high correlation 
between MCAT scores and 
grade point averages . 
Acc:>rding to UCSD Med 
School a i tant dean Percy 
J. Ru sell, the reason is 
imple : ome people have 

never learned how to take a 
te t. 

Dr Ru ell , who is also an 
as so iat profe sor of 
biology, gave two rea on 
for the di crepancy : " The 
majority of minority 
students don't com from a 
family background which 
gives them any help. All the 
little helpful hints that 
college tudent pick up 
around the hom never 
come about for them . 

communities that you don't 
have to study for the test ; 
that it is a routine thing. I 
have heard it many times . 
It's the kind of thing that 
gets battered about the 
community and you can' t 
tear it down " 

The program, which IS 
open to tudents from 
UCSD, the Unlver Ityof an 
Diego ("and anyone el e 
who can make u e of what 
we offer") and United 
State Internationa l 
Univer Ity, is funded by a 
grant from the Project 75 
program of the federal 
department of Health , 
Education, and Welfare It

Transporter to Mark 
~hird Year 

It won't be your usual Valentine's Day party although 
the traditional hearts and flowers and lots of I~ve will be 
in evidence. 

The very existence of the tiny guests puts it in a 
special category. 

Receiving invitations to the 3:30 p.m . "reunion" at 
Unive~sity Hos~ital will ~e babies from San Diego and 
Impenal counties who are alive and well because of a 
transport service which brought them to the hospital's 
Infant Special Care Center during the past year. 

The Feb. 14 party will mark the third anniversary si nce 
the transporter, the "hospital on wheels" which ac-
companies it, and a four-person transport team made 
the first emergency run to Scripps Hospital from the 
center in February, 1971. 

Last year, 217 severely ill babies were transported 
from 28 hospitals in San Diego and Imperial counties to 
the University Hospital specialized unit. 

T/1ey started life in the outlyi ng hospita Is with the 
odds stacked against them - some weighing under two 
pounds, most prematurely born with severe illnesses 

Si~c~ many of t~ese hospitals don't have the highly 
sophisticated equipment and specially trained per-
sonnel to care for the severely ill newborn, a call is sent 
to. the center at Un iversity Hospital, and within 20 
minutes the transport team is off in ambulance or 
helicoPter to pick up the tiny patient. 

Inauguration of the transport service marked a local 
milestone in saving the lives of critically ill babies, since 
In the past many would have died en route from an 
outlying hospital to a major care center. 

.Greeting the. honorees and their parents at the party 
will be Dr. LoUIS Gluck, head of the Infant Special Care 
Cent~r and professor of pediatri cs and reproductive 
mediCine, UCSD Schoo l of M edicine.

Department Chairmen has 
forwarded a selection 
through the administrative 
channels for a chairman for 
the Political Science 
Department. 

Although the name was 
not released it was learned 
that the new poly sci 
chairman is one of the top 
political scientists in the 
country . 

Details concerning the 
name and background of 
the new chairman will be 
released as soon as the 
selection has become 
finalized. This is expected 
to take about three weeks. 

With the selection of a

Support CALPIRG 
CALPIRG , the California Public Interest Research 

Group, is paving the way for student power of the 
future. 

By providing a central core of students, CALPIRG is 
showing what students can do. As a series of articles in 
the Treton Times has shown, student activism of the 60's 
has died out. 

Major newspapers and magazines have concluded 
that students don't or won't care about their com-
munity, their education or their life . CALPIRG ' has 
al ready proven them wrong. 

- It has hown that " discount stores " mity not really be 
discount . 

- It has pushed for laws prevE'nting disc rimination 
against women in receiving ((I'dit . 

- Students in CALPI RG have f'xposed to the county 
that major stores add too mLich fat to hamburgers. 

- It is working on legislative profiles of elected of-
ficials to get the crook s OLit Clnd thE' good people in 
office . 

The Triton Times hopes that our own CALPIRG will do 
more of these same project~ as it grows stronger. 

Because of its past pertormance and potential , the 
Triton Times urges that UCSD students support 
CALPIRG in any way that they can . 

Every student can and should support CALPIRG by 
fi ll ing out the membership card in their Spring 
registration packets and by paying their dues. The e~tra 
dollar that you pay will hardly be missed by you , but 
will go a long way if pooled with other students' money. 

CALPI RG is a solution and the Triton Times urges 
students at UCSD to use it by supporting CALPIRG.

Hitchhikers 
Editor : 

As understand it 
another UCSD woman 
hitchhiker has been kid-
napped and raped . My 
reaction transcends merely 
being appalled : I'd most 
emphatically like to see 
something done to prevent 
future occurences. 

Since for many h it-
chhiking remains a primary 
means of transportation, 
even though it obviously is 
dangerous , rather than 
admonish the hitchhikers I 
think it would be advisable 
to present an alternative to 
" blind" hitchhiking . I 
therefore suggest, 1) a 
volunteer program whereby 
students willing to provide 
transportation for h it-
chhikers have a 
prominently displayed 
notice on their windshield 
indicating their availability 
for that purpose and 
identifying who they are, 
and also an I.D. for hit-
chhikers to protect the 
driver (a student I.D. would 
do for this -- I am making 
the implicit assumption 
that students are "safe" , 2) 
an immediate attempt to 
establ ish carpools v ia 
computer matching. This I 
would think would be a 
better use for registration 
fees than others I've heard 
of, and would establish a 
means to provide tran-
sportation for all who are in 
need. 

It's true< this may be 

inconven ient expensive -
timeconsuming or whatever 
but what is more important : 
a little inconvenience or a 
student's I ife, person, or 
frepciom ? 

Stephen Carpenter 
(U12487680) 

T.US.C. 
Editor : 

I n his 'article of January 
29, entitled "New Student 
Government," Rick Drom 
stated the following : 
" I nstead UCSD chose to 
abandon this , traditional 
form of representation and 
devise a new structure." I 
would like to ask Mr. Drom 
for some further details on 
exactly how UCSD made 
this choice. 

Let's face it; T.U.S.C. has 
about as much popular 
mandate as the nearest 
eucalyptus tree. 

Although this new 
student organization may 
differ in many ways from 
the typical student 
government , it sti ll retain s 
one tradi tional pra ctice : it 
collec ts money from the 
student body. I believe the 
correct amount of this 
mandatory assessment is 
$6.00 per quarter, not $6.00 
per year as was stated in the 
article.

JIM MESSINA AND THE JESTERS, [by 
yme) • Thimble TI p.] 

Is it Dick Dale and the Deltones? ... 
Johnny and the Hurricanes? '" Jay and 
the Keylows? .. , Would you believe it, it's 
Jim Messina and the Jesters! 

There they are cover posing, in-
struments in hand, 'round a 63 'vette, five 
Jesters dressed in matching red blazers, 
and there's Jim " the man" Messina clad 
in black pegged pants, and black "ivy 

'league" sweater over white shirt and 
black tie. 

What kind of music do the Jesters 
play? The liner notes say it best .. . "If you 
want to assign JJ!e Jesters a spot in 
today's popular-music panorama, locate 
them close to the surfing sound. As an 
ins trumental combination , the 
designation fits; the group is comprised 
mostly of guitarists -- four of them - plus 
tenor saxophone and drums. Too, their 
beat is a hard driving one . The overall 
effect is controlled frenzy ." 

While admittedly there's a bizarre part 
nostalgic appeal to crew-cut Messina & 
Co. playing hits and ";'isses like 
"R.1unchy," "Honky Tonk," "No Name 
Dr.1gster," their theme song, "The Jester," 
etc., this record in reality contains all the 
aesthetic worth of Duane Eddy's insipid 
slinky-stringed standards, or Dick Dale's 
formula surfer stomps. 

To further enhance the LP's overall 
nostalgic effect, Thimble Records 
released this package using the same 
format used in its original release some 
ten years ago; both liner notes and 
photos are apparently intact and 
identical to originals . 

In the year of " American Graffitti" and 
with the present star-status of Loggi ns 
and Messina, Jim Messin.1 .1nd the Jesters 
has to be considered " timely," but 
" musically" .. . this is an LP for collectors, 
hard-core Messina buffs and novelty 
fiends, only!

ALL AMERICAN BOY, Rick Derrinaer • 
Blue Sky kZ12481 

Rick Derringer's long-awaited debut 
" solo" album is a limited, disappointing 
musical effort. He proves himself a 
capable vocalist here and his guitar play 
is consistent with his pleasant economic 
technique recorded behind Johnny and 
Edgar Wi nter in the recent past, but his 
writing is uneven, sometimes even 
hackneyed, and the production quality is 
overall quite thin, i.e. crisp on top, heavy 
on the bottom, with no middle. In fact 
the production itself is so consciously 
contrived, that it negates any intrinsic 
vitality the LP might otherwise have had . 

All American Boy in total , is a clear, 
sometimes interesting but moretimes 
steri le, showcase for a decidedly talented 
veteran rock artist. Better luck next time .

BARRY MANILOW, Barry Manilow • Bell 
1129 

Aside from the thoughtful inclusion of 
a fair scat-sung rendition of the great 
Lambert , Hendricks and Ross hit 
"Cloudburst," Barry Manilow (the albumi 
comes off as a slick 37 minutes in the 
recorded life of an average studio-
enhanced cabaret singer. Barry may be a 
promising talent but this is a dull, at best 
superficial LP .

UNREAL, Bloodstone - London XPS634 

Unre.11 varies from glossy, exceSSively 
produced (strings, horns and reeds 
galore) originals, to' insensitive distorted 
interpretations of various rock'n'roll

standards. Overall, the album is quite 
typical of the general move rhythm & 
blues has undergone since the mid-
sixties; from a distinct musical form 
eventually synthesized into the pop 
realm, and now, typified by such vague 
artistic endeavors as Unreal, into blase 
R&B muzak. This record contains all the 
personal conviction and warmth of the 
Osmonds in blackface. Ever heard a 
medly of "Hound Dog," "Se.1rchin" and 
"So Fine" done to the rhythm of "Funky,

Savoy Brown must be approaching a 
record as they open their 17th (count 
'em) U .S. tour February 9, in Phoenix. 
Sole survivor of "the original " Savoy 
Brown, guitarist Kim Simmonds, will be 
backed this trip by fellow British 
musicians Miller Anderson (formerly 
vocal ist for Keef Hartley's band), Stan 
Webb (guitarist/ vocalist/ writer / founder 
of now defunct Chicken Shack,) Jimmy 
Leverton and Eric Dillon. The 25-city tour 
concludes March 20, in Providence, 
Rhode Island. 

English band " Yes" will be using a 
special promotion gimmick on their 
upcoming U.S. tour . A 63-foot high hot 
air balloon has been constructed and 
equipped with gondola, radio equip-
ment, two-way telephones and propane 
gas burners to heat the air . The craft, to 
be tethered at sites near Yes concerts, 

. wilicarryDJ's and the press on a free ride. 
The balloon was designed by noted 
balloonist Donn Miller, graphics created 
by longtime Yes art director Roger Dean 
who's designed a series of "Yes" album 
jackets including their latest : Tala From 
Topogr.1phic Oceans. 

Yes? No! 
That interpretation oJ "Journey to the 

Center of the brth" staged by Rick 
Wakeman (on January 18) and narrated 
by David Hemmings will definitely be 
released on one disc rather than two. 
Release of the shortened version is set for 
April ' and A&M's worried about a 
bootleg. According to A&M sources, it 
was impossible to make it a two-disc set 
because of the vinyl shortage. 

Those kings of recorded acappella, the 
Persuasions, are no longer with MCA 
(after only one album) and are currently 
negotiating with other labels . They've a 
new lead tenor, the unknown Mr. "X" 
replaces Jay Otis Washington . 

Mercury Records has signed ex-
Reprise, ex- Buddah artist Captain 
Beefheart and his Magic Band. 

Be-Bop-A-Lula, She's-My-Bay-Bea. 
Coming from Capitol in March, a new 

Gene Vincent packa ge containing 
nothing but uptempo tunes recorded in 
1956. Produced by Michael Ross, it's to 
be called The Bop Just Won't Stop (1956). 

Also due in March : 
Toniaht's the Night, Neil Young's next 

and ... the first solo album from 
Chicago's vocalist/keyboardist Bobby 
Lamm. The LP is based on Lamm's own 
compositions " in the style of various 60's 
artists ." (I don't know what that means 
either!) 

Ex-Face Ronnie Lane with Slim Chance 
(his back-up band) will embark soon on a 
caravan-style tour of England complete 
with 25()().seat capacity tent . 

Eagle's now a quintet after having 
added guitarist Don Felder. Felder was 
formerly with David Blues bad-up band. 
He participated on just one cut of their 
new album but will tour with the band as 
soon as they finish recording. 

Traffic will now be distributed 
stateside by Elektra/Asylum rather than 
Capitol. This is in exchange for Island's 
getting U.K. distribution rights to the new 
Bob Dylan album .

usn Here Tonite SPORTS 
The UtSD Volleyball 

Team continued their 
winning ways over the 
weekend, as they over-
powered a team from 
Dominguez Hills State 
University in four sets . 

The team showed the 
consistency it will need to 
stand up to the powerhouse 
teams like UCLA and UCSB 
as they dominated all facets 
of the game in a 15-10, 15-7, 
11-15 and 15-6 win. 

The Dominguez block 
was completely unable to 
stop the spikes of Bruce 
Cazden and Tim Myrick. 
Both Baldwin brothers and 
hitters Mike McMahon and 
Steve Simpson were 
devastating with their wipe-
off spikes. 

The defense, especially 
the digging, was the best 
that has been seen this 
seas on, and back-row 
spec ialists George 
Yamashita and Mark Duret 
were their usual consistent 
selves . 

At 6:30 the next morning, 
fo llowi ng hours of 
celebration, the tired, and 
so mewhat hungover, 
Tritons travelled up to Los 
Angeles Valley College to 
partic ipate in a USVBA 
tournament . 

Playing in the tough 
Upper 'AA ' division, the 
team faced the big boys like 
California and Hawaii (who 
usually play in the 'AA' 
division), the Hobbits , 
Loyola University (who also 
had made the move up to 
the Upper 'A' Division) and 
none other than the in-
famous team from up north, 
UCSB. 

Despite their condition, 
the Tritons handily 
defeated Loyola, 11-8, 11-8; 
but again came up on the 
short end of an 11-5, 12-10 
duel with Santa Barbara . 
Another tough battle with 
the Hobbits followed , 
before the Tritons fell to C 
& H, 11-5, 11-6. 

The vo ll eyba ll team 's 
next outing will be a match 
with Long Beach City

The UCSD Varsity 
basketball team will at-
tempt to extend its win 
streak to four games tonight 
as they entertain crosstown 
rival USD. The game will be 
played in the main gym at 8 
p.m . 

I n action ove,. the 
weekend the Tritons 
sound ly trounced California 
Lutheran College by the 
score of 92-70. According to 
Coach Reeves it was a typical 
performance by his team, 
bombing the opponent off 
the court in the first half 
then playing very sloppy 
basketball the second half. 
Fortunately for the Tritons 
Cal Lutheran was even 
sloppier. 

Joe Coit and Paul Trainer 
led the first half runaway as 
the Tritons streaked to a 49-
35 halftime lead. Trainer 
scored all 14 of his points in 
the first half and Coit 
dominated the boards at 
both ends of the court while 

scorin~ 13 points. 

As mentioned the second 

half was characteri zed by 
extremely sloppy play on 
the part of both teams. The 
few bright spots in the last 
half were provided by 
George Calhoun and Coit, 
as well as one Geno Dente 
of Cal Lutheran who scored 
'most of his game high 27 
points on long arching 
bombs from over twenty 
feet away. Calhoun and 
Coit led the UCSD fast 
break in the second half, 
Calhoun getting 12 points 
and Coit another eight. 

All in all it was a game in 
which everyone got to play. 
Rusty Knight managed to 
please his ever present fan 
club with a couple of 
spec tacu lar plays . Rusty, 
among other thin gs, 
manag'ed hit a turn around 
jumper at the buzzer in the 
fi rst ha If, then blocked two 
successive shots by a CLC 
player, and taking the ball 
the full length of the court, 
dribbled behind his back to 
fake out one player and 
took the ball in for a lay-up. 
Rusty ended the game with 
six points as well as ad-

Kircher (1 1 points , 7 
rebounds), Steve Higgins (6 
points, 7 rebounds). and Joe 
Sivilli (8 points) . As 
mentioned Paul Trainer also 
got 14 points before getting 
into foul trouble at the 
beginning of the second 
half. 

As promised Leo Dejohn 
did show up, much to the 
distress of a few Ca l 
Lutheran fans who hap-
pened to be si tting near 
him . Leo and his horn were 
a one man cheering section 
for the Tritons all night. If 
.you want to get a load of his 
antics as well as see a good 
basketball game, come on 
over to the gym tonight at 8 
p.m. as the Tritons tangle 
with a powerful USD 
basketball squad . 

Ruggers Gain Split 
.In Rough Matches 

What a drag this Pa5t 
week-end was for the UCSD 
ruggers The Tri ton rugby 
team took on the brawling 
teams from Dominguez 
Hills and Santa Ana . In the 
first team game, UCSD 
thrashed the Dominguez 
Hills Punks 16-4 In the 
seconds game, the Santa 
Ana Jerks dominated the 
Tritons In a romp that 
ended earlv due to several 
altercations InvolVing 
Johnno Csonka and a Jerk 
fully half hiS size. Referee 
Denis Weiss called Santa 
Ana, one of the worst rugby 
clubs he has seen in several 
years Both games were not 
what one would call a lot of 
fun . 

The first team defeated 
the Punks mainly due to the 
fine running and ex-
perienced play of the backs 
Mark Lewhew, Wally, and 
Thapin did a fine job 

controlling the Punk of-
fenSive effort With good 
pursuit and foolish tackling 
The game was very nearly 
called when a Punk foward 
attacked the rpfer p The 
InCident caused the player 
to be suspended for the 
entire season 

The second t am game 
seemed to be worse The 
Santa Ana lerks played a 
particularly cheap game, 
which was a double drag 
because the Jerks really 
didn 't want to mar the 
game, as they did The Jerks 
had a trong and talented 
leam that could have 
played a fine game Without 
a lot of unnecessary gar-
bage that does nothing for 
the game of rugby or the 
enjoyment of the players 
Next week the ruggers are 
looking for better things as 
the Tritons host San Diego 
St, here next Saturday at 
noon .
