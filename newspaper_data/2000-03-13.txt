BEIRUT, Lebanon - Israel's 
ties with theArab world received 
a fresh jolt Sunday when a 
brusquely worded Arab League 
communique condemning Israel 
for its role in Lebanon prompted 
equally biting responses from 
leading Israeli politicians, one of 
whom called the Arab countries' 
attitude "surreal." 

The exchange of polemics

Women's Roles Discussed 
FORUM: Angela Davis participated in international conference at UCSD 
.,AUXJ. LU 
Contributing Staff Writer 

In celebration of the March 8 
International Women's Day, 
UCSD hosted an international 
conference last Wednesday 
through Saturday, focusing on 
the changing roles of women 
throughout the world. 

The four-day conference, 
titled "Building New Societies: 
Women in Asia and Latin 
America," included three pre-
sentations by distinguished 
woman leaders: Estela B. de 
Carlotto of Grandmothers of 
the Plaza de Mayo in 
Argentina, Tao Jie of Peking 

University and Angela Davis of 
UC Santa Cruz. 

The portion of the program 
held Friday and Saturday 
focused on women in Asia and 
Latin America. It consisted of 
various panels addressing top-
ics such as "Gender 
Socialization and Schools," 
"Women and Politics" and 
"Social Control and Sexual 
Regulation." 

UCSD history Professor 
Christine Hunefeldt, a coordi-
nator for the conference, said 
she hoped the ~m would 
help remind others of the com-
plexity of women's issues. 

"There are many ways to 

think of women's issues," 
Hunefeldt said. "Participants in 
our interdisciplinary program 
will trace the long-term similar-
ities and differences in feminist 
agendas, by analyzing women 
in different national and region-
al settings, and in different 
walks of life." 

Davis, an author and human 
rights activist, spoke at the con-
ference. Her presentation, 
"Wars Against Women - Past, 
Present, and Future?" focused 
on women's triumphs and 
obstacles on the eve of the 21st 
century.

Union Files 
Complaints 
Against UC 
LABOR: TA at all UC 
campuses approved 
strike by a wide margin 
By VINCENT GRAGNANI 
News Editor 

UCSD's union-affiliated teach-
ing assistants voted last week 
490-82 to authorize a TA trike, 
ending three weeks of sy-
temwide TA voting. The TA 
unions also filed over 40 unfair 
labor charges against the univer-
sity, according to a -..tatement 
released last Thursday . 

The unions, all affiliated with 
United Auto Worker , charge the 
univerSity with bargaining in bad 
faith, refusing to provide critical 
information, unilaterally chang-
ing working conditions, delaying 
bargaining and engaging in 
excessive bargaining. 

C. Judson King, provost and 
senior vice pre ident of academic 
affairs for the University of 
California, stated that the univer-
sity is committed to resolving 
labor disputes and reaching a 
mutually agreeable contract. 

King said the university is bar-
gaining in good faith and outlined 
some of the offers made to the TAs. 

"The university's current offer 
would provide academic student 
employees with improvements in 
a number of a reas, including 
salaries, fee remissions and over-
all working conditions," King 
stated. "[The univerSity) is also 
continuing to pursue the issue of 
health benefits enhancements."

A female African-American 
student was assaulted outside the

Tuesday morning. In another

PROPOSALS: Chancellor said increased funding for O.A.S.lS. and Summer Bridge is not yet avaiJabJe 
., VINCENT QRMNANI 
News Editor 

Chancellor Dynes recently 
issued a response to the 
November recommendations of 
the student subcommittee of the 
Diversity Council, which was 
formed last year to help increase 
diversity at UCSD. 

The student subcommittee 
recommendations, which were 
presented to the campus in a Jan. 
18 town hall meeting, aim to 
increase diversity among stu-
dents, faculty and staff. 

Dynes' response covers three 
areas addressed by the subcom-
mittee recommendations: increas-
es in scholarship funding, perma-

, ,,ent funding of the OffiCE; o( 
I Academic Support and Instruct-

ional Services, and examination 
and assessment of admissions 
policies. 

With respect to scholarships, 
Dynes said he is exceeding his 
personal goal of tripling UCSD's 
scholarship base by 2002. 

"We are a lmost there two 
years ahead of schedule with 
$976,768 in undergraduate schol-
arships this year," Dynes stated. 
"Undergraduate scholarship 
support for underrepresented 
students will continue to be a 
priority for our campus." 

The subcommittee also rec-
ommended increased funding 
on a permanent basis for 
O.A.S.l.S. and the Summer 
Bridge program. The Summer 

. Bridge Rrogram and a portion of 
O.A.S.I.S. are rurrentfy fundecl 

by the administration on a tem-
porary basis. 

The subcommittee stated 
that more resources should be 
provided to O.A.S.I.S. for its 
contribution to underrepresent-
ed students' retention and 
development. 

The subcommittee's report 
stated, "These funds will con-
tribute to equitable outcomes -
retention, graduation and 
matriculation to graduate. and 
professional school- for under-
represented students and a more 
positive campus climate that 
facilitates the development of 
underrepresented students." 

In hi response, Dynes stated 
that while there were no perma-
nent unallocated funds available 
for O:A.S.I.S and' Summer 

Bridge, the program would con-
tinue to receive funds and may 
receive future increases in its 
funding. 

"The use of ' temporary' funds 
for th is program in no way 
implies that this program is 
regarded as temporary," Dynes 
stated. "Vice Chancellor Watson 
has emphasized his intentions to 
increase funding for programs 
that Significantly increase the 
grades and graduate/profes-
sional school .~dmissions test 
scores of underrepresented 
UCSD students." 

A.S. President Tesh Khullar 
said he was disappointed in 
Dynes' response to the recom-
mendation for increased

Continued from ..... 1 

Davis explored the recent 
controversy over Propositions 21 
and 22, and said she saw the two 
as a sign of growing intolerance 
against minors or minorities. 

She also said that wumen's 
successes toward equality, peace 
and development alw ays run 
the risk of being tr ivialized. 
Regard ing social activ ism and

special in that she combines 
activism on behalf of women and 
people of color." 

Smith went on to express his 
feelings toward the program as 
a whole and the public' s 
response. 

'It has been an extraordinary 
project," Smith said. "It's exceed-
ed all our expectations, especially 
the energy among the partici-
pants and speakers. I think it 
bodes very well for the future of 
the women's movement." 

The program was sponsored 
by The Center for Iberian and 
Latin American Studies in asso-
ciation with UCSD's Graduate 
School of International 
Relations and Pacific Studies 
and the Program in Critical 
Gender Studies. Funding was 
provided by the Ford 
Foundation, the Center for 
Global Partnership, UCSD and 
the UC System. 

that he will study the use of SAT 
scores and advanced placement 
scores in the admissions process. 

He also stated that the 
administration will study the 
effects of the 4 percent plan, 
w h ich admits the top 4 percent 
of students i n each California 
high school. 

Khullar said that while he 
thought Dynes' responses were 
too vague, he believes that the 
act ions of the Diversity Council 
will increase diversity at UCSD. 

" I think it will have a very pos-
itive impact," Khu:tar said. 
" H opefulfy the Diversity Council 
won' t end."

Day care and Summer Options 
Expo to Be Held Tuesday 

Chancellor Dynes invites the campus community 
to attend the sixth annual Day Care and Summer 
Options Expo on Tuesday in the Price Center 
Ballroom from 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. The Expo will 
offer UCSD's faculty, staff and students a friendly 
"one'stop shopping" environment in which to 
explore the many child care possibilities available in 
San Diego. 

The Day Care and Summer Options Expo was intro-
duced in 1995 to provide the UCSD community with 
convenient opportunities to meet and interact with 
child care and summer programs representatives. As 
a result, a significant number of child care providers, 
vendors and UCSD Employee Support Services ' 
departments have been invited to participate in this 
year's Expo. 

This event is a collaborative effort sponsored by 
the UCSD Earty Childhood Education Center, the 
Human Resources Department and Transportation 
and Parking Services. In recognition of the value of 
the Expo to the ' campus community, Dynes has 
approved a one-hour administrative leave with pay for 
Tuesday so employees may attend this event. 
Supervisors may allow employees one hour of admin-
istrative leave with pay to attend the Expo when the 
absence will not infringe upon the performance of the 
employee's required duties. 

~n the March 6 article titled ·Price of Cigarettes May Rise,' the status of the General Store was 
Incorrectly described. It is not funded by the A.S. Council. It was also incorrectly stated that Vice 
C.hancellor Watson and A.S. President Tesh Khullar had reached a compromise on the issue. They 
did not reach a compromise, they only discussed one. 
In.the March 6 ~rticle titled ·College Democrats Hold Debate in Price Center,· the role of Morley 
WInDguard was Incorrectly stated. Winoguard is a senior policy advisor to Vice President Gore not 
to Gore's campaign. ' 
In the March 9 sports section, men's l1o.meter hurdler John Hall of UCLA was incorrectly identi-
fied as being a member of the UCSD team. 
The Guardian regrets the errors.

Under pressure from the music industry, universities are infringing on students' rights 
By MELANIE HOHLFB.D 
Staff Writer 

The Recording Industry Association 
of America presumes to censor the free 
speech in American universities like 
UCSD. All across the country, and most 
recently in the UC system, the RIAA has 
been strong-arming universities with the 

t~eat of lawsuits to ban digital media 
like MP3s and the utilities designed to 
find them, like Napster. Under the guise 
of copyright protection, the RIAA seeks 
to maximize profits to the detriment of 
musicians' free speech and students' 
Internet access. What the association 
does not realize is that limiting digital 
media is unjustified and ultimately 
impractical. 

The RlAA claims that services like 
Napster violate copyrighrahd intellectual 
property laWs. Granted, when students 
share copyrighted songs via Napster, they 
are violating laws under the No Electronic 
Theft Act and the Digital Millennium 

Copyright Act. both of which extend tradi-
tional copyright and intellectual property 
laws to the Internet. However, copyrights 
and intellectual property laws are mere 
economic tools used by the govenunent to 
motivate people to produce. 

If an artist desires to distribute music 
over digital mediums like Napster in the 

. absence of copyrights, then the First 
Amendment protects that form of speech. 
Artists like Dave Matthews, Phish and Tori 
Amos freely drculate their live music on 
the Internet under the condition that no 
one makes a profit from their work. 

Unknown bands benefit from digital 
media as well. With the advent of tech-
nology like MP3s, bands that historically 
have not been able to get a recording 
label can still be heard. The RIAA has no 
justification to pressure colleges to ban 
services that fadlitate this exchange. 

Furthermore, while the trade of unli-
censed material is illegal, digital media 
like Napster is not. The RIAA suggests 
that the mere existence of Napster is il\e-

gal and is putting pressure on colleges to 
ban its use to prevent illegal activity. 
Colleges, however, should not penalize 
all their students simply because some of 
them abuse the system. One guilty col-
lege student does not justify prohibiting 
of other students from enjoying the bene-
fits of the techno 10K}'. This country does 
not espouse guilt by association. 
Universities cannot disrupt the legal 
exchange of MP3s if students have paid 
for the bandwidth and the college has no 
proof of illegal activity. 

Th~ first university to feel the pressure 
from the RIAA was the University of 
Oregon. Last November the RIAA accost-
ed tlle college, pointing out the liabilities 
involved with illegal student use of 
search utilities like Napster. Although the 
RIAA maintains that it has never threat-
ened a school with a lawsuit, its decision 
to outline the college's liability is an 
implicit threat. See..., Page 7

Proposition 22 Is Not the Final Say 
COMMENTARY: Ban on same-sex marriages could still be overturned 
By KEVIN SEID 
Staff Writer 

Last week, California voters 
approved Proposition 22, the. 
Limit on Marriage Initiative with 
61 percent voting in favor to 39 
percent voting against it. The 
infamous ballot measure stipu-
lates that "only marriage between 
a man and a woman is legal and 
valid in California." The initiative 
also closed a loophole in the law 
that previously mandated that 
California had to recognize same-
sex marriages should they ever 
become legal in another state. 

Many of those who supported 
Proposition 22 were celebrating 
throughout the night on the day 01 
the primary. However, opponents 
of the ballot measure eventually 
may have the last laugh. Even 
though the initiative passed, it's 
quite possible for Proposition 22 to 
be overturned in the future. 

decades and the older age groups 
pass away, the state's citizens may 
become more sympathetic to gay 
and lesbian marriages. 

Proposition 22 might also be 
overturned in California courts 
once another state does eventually 
legalize same-sex marriages. 
Currently, legal challenges cannot 
be filed because no injured party 
exists, so no one has the legal 
standing to bring a case against the 
proposition. However, once anoth-
er state permits same-sex mar-
riages, then Proposition 22 could

quite possible for

First. o( all, PropoSition 22 can 
be repealed with the passage of 
another ballot initiative. In fact, 
voters may be asked to vote for 
such an initiative in the fall . Tom 
Henning of San Francisco and his 
supporters are cuL'!~ntly trying to

performed elsewhere. In addi-
tion, the law discriminates on the 
basis of sexual orientation 

beca~ it does single out same-
sex marriages as the criterion for 
,its "gay and lesbian exception." 

Of course, if the U.s. Supreme 
Court ever ruled that same-sex 
marriages are protected under the 
Constitution, then every state law 
prohibiting such marriages 
would be overturned, including 
Proposition 22.11 wouldn't matter 
if the injured party bringing the 
case to the high court came from a 
state other tha.n California. 

Today it is doubtful that any 
court would rule in favor of same-
sex marriages. Lawmakers are 
scared of the issue because of the 
possible reaction from their con-
stituents. Many people still want 
to preserve the traditional princi-
ple of marriage - the union of 
two members of the opposite sex. 
Same-sex marriages are perceived 
by many as just adding special 
privileges and exceptions to the 
traditional concept. Such privi-
leges are not rights protected 
under any law in the country. 

On the other hand, if people 
became more tolerant of same-sex 
marriages in the future, then 
California and the rest of the 
country could start viewing 
same-sex marriages more as a 
right than a privilege in the years 
to come. Future judges might be 
more willing to overturn laws 
such as Proposition 22. Future 
lawmakers may favor legalizing 
gay and lesbian marriages. 

II all depends on how people's 
perceptions of same-sex marriage 
change in the future. For those 
who opposed Proposition 22, the 
fight to legalize same-sex mar-
riages has only I'ust b6un. For 
those who still avor tFi'e tradi-
tional definition of marriage, 
their work is far from over.

Do You Agree With Bertrand? 
COMMENTARY: New religion offers eternal salvation for a mere $100 
By BERTRAND FAN 
Columnist 

Hi! My name is Bertrand Fan, 
and I'm a sophomore at Warren 
college. I was living a rather ordi-
nary life until Feb. 28, the day our 
lord Michael Carley wrote Paid 
Advertisement. Paid 
Advertisement changed my life 
the moment I read it, as most 
Guardiall advertisements do. 

After I read Paid 
Advertisement, I sat down and 
started thinking about how witty 
Michael really is. I mean, "Do you 
agree with Michael?" is probably 
the wittiest religious catch-phrase 
I've heard since "What's missing 
in CH CH? UR." It was then 
that I realized that Michael him-
self is a god. He's an example to 
all of us. Michael makes me want 
to get down on my hands and 
knees and start performing fella-
tio for him . 

Michaelianity is different from 
most of the alternative religions 
that I've joined or created. 
Michael loves me (Michael 4:20). I 
can see Michael. I know he exists. 
I can call him up and talk to him. 
I can beat him over the head with 
a baseball bat when I'm having a 
really lousy da~ and I suspect it's 
his fault. Yet I m having a prob-
lem convincing other people to 
join. Some of my friends believe 
in some of the aspects of 
Michaelianity, but have problems 
with others. bressing like Nazis is 
an issue that comes uf a lot. 

really have to go on is Paid 
Advertisement, and the rest of the 
stuff I just make up. For example, 
I've decided to stop using obscen-
ities when I need to exp~ my 
discomfort and instead say, 
"Michael Carley!" Or, if the situa-
tion requires even more empha-
sis, "Michael J. Carley!" I'm not 
really sure what Michael's middle 
name is because I haven't done 
much research into the matter, 
but J. really seemed to flow well. 
Other, seemingly more important 
concepts, I've just pulled out of 

By following my 
instructions, anybody

my ass - much like most major 
world religiOns. 

I've constructed a great sce-
nario for the afterlife. Here's how 
it works: if you mail a check or 
money order made out to 
"Bertrand Fan" or cash amount-
ing to $100 to the Guardian office 
in an envelope marked "For 
Bertrand Fan" (payoff may also 
be hand-delivered), you go to 
heaven. Otherwise, you go to 
hell. Heaven and hell In my sys-
tem are identical to their 
Christian counterparts. 

hell am I going to round up a 
hundred bucks?" Here's the solu-
tion: Start walking on Library 
Walk, and beat the first person 
you see wearing a Michael t-shirt 
to a bloody pulp. As expected, 
they won' t fight back. Sooner or 
later, some nice campus police 
officers will come and take you 
away, and you' ll serve your 
appropriate jail time. 

But here's what I've discov-
ered - after you serve your jail 
time, in order to help you get 
adjusted back into SOCiety, the 
police give you $100 upon 
release. Simply take this money, 
place it in an envelope, and mail 
it to the Guardian office with my 
name on it. There. You're going to 
heaven. If you' re not completely 
satisfied with heaven, I'm offer-
ing a money-back guarantee 
(minus a 15 percent restocking 
fee). 

By following my instructions, 
anybody can go to heaven. This 
religion is completely nonexclu-
sionary. And you don't have to 
have faith in anything. No "[ 
believe Michael Carley rose from 
the dead" or HI believe Michael 
Carley died for my sins." Not 
even "I don' t want to sin any 
more." You can sin as much as 
you want to. Lie! Cheat! Steal! 
Write libelous and slanderous 
columns! It doesn' t matter!

CoGp Does Not ·Serve UCSD's Best Interests By SeIlIng CIgarettes 
Editor. 

We would like to address 
some of the issues discussed in 
the article "Price Of Cigarettes 
May Rise" (Mar. 6). First of aU, we 
would like t9- commend Dr. 
Watson and Tesh Khullar for 
bringing this critical issue to the 
forefront. 

If the university co-op's mis-
sion is to "act in the best interest 
of UCSD students" then why 
should it sell cigarettes? We know 
tobacco is the number one pre-
ventable cause of death in the 
United States, estimated at caus-
ing over 400,000 deaths a year. To 
put it in tenns we can all relate to, 
this is equivalent to two 747 jets 
crashing each day. As Dr. Watson 
said, no other product that the c0-
op sells kills "when used as 
directed." 

UCSD is known as one of the 
top research institutes in the 
world. We have one of the best 
cancer centers in the United 
States. We have on our campus 
the' California Smoker's Helpline 
(l-800-NO-BUTI'S - 1-800-662-
8887). With all this in mind, it's a 
bad message to the community 
that we also seU the product that 
ca uses all these deaths. 

With aU due respect to George 
Gonzales, what's wrong with let-
ting people who smoke buy their 
cigarettes somewhere else? As he 
so aptly put it, "smokers already 
pay an extra 50 cents a pack on 
taxes." If students really want to 
smoke they will know to buy 
their cigarettes before coming 
onto campus. 

The comment that cigarettes 
are being singled out is absolute-
ly ridiculous. Soda, high-fat food 
and other products, when used as 
d irected, do not kill. Even alcohol 
was misrepresented as a bigger 
problem. 

Well, tobacco is more deadly. 
In terms of "real" causes of death 
in the United States, alcohol is 
estimated to cause 100,000 deaths 
per year, compared to tobacco's 
400,000 per year. 

Secondhand smoke kills 
53,000 per year. It is the number 
three most preventable cause of 
death in the United States. This 
statistic alone prompted 
California to ban cigarette smok-
ing in bars and restaurants. 

Nobody is saying we want to 
take away the right to smoke 
from students. If they want to 
smoke, let them smoke. We total-
ly respect that right. That stiU 
does not mean that we as a cam-
pus should sell a product that we 
know kills so many. 

We would like to commend all 
the other vendors on our campus 

'for making the decision not to sell 
cigarettes and for not allowing 
the profit dollar to influence their 
choice and disguise it as "a right 
for students." 

Thanks for listening.

Everyone: 

Take a deep breath, calm down 
and listen to that little voice 
inside. 

As a Jewish anarchist from 
Berzerkely with a Taoist focus, I 
can honestly say that I do agree 
with Michael, and I think he had 
a sreat idea with last week's 
campaign. If the apparent con-
tradiction above scares lOU' go 
ahead and stop reading. under-
stand. Go back to sleep. The 
truth is complicated and para-
doxical, but not really that 
important. Just folpt abOut it. 

Anybody stiU there? I'd like 
to think there's at least a few 
people on this campus who, like 
me, realize that the Blue Shirt 
campaign is not some insidious 
attack on freedom of religion, 
not a perversion of Christianity. 

We don't have anything close 
to freedom of religion in this 
country. Just ask the Monnons 
and the Rastafarians about 
polygamy and ganja. What we 
have is limited freedom of 
expression, and that's exactly 
what the Blue Shirts are exercis-
ing, in a much more innocuous 

fashion than a friend of mine 
with a bumper sticker that reads 
"Fuck your Christ." 

I'm sure Michael, my Rabbi 
and most of you would agree 
that having religion requires 
faith, commitment, devotion 
and other spiritual strengths. It 
isn't easy, but the rewards are 
high in this life, whether or not 
you believe in the next one. 
What kind of spiritual strength 
can you claim to have if it is 
threatened by a slogan on a T-
shirt? 

I don't know what's behind 
Michael's claim to have tried 
other religious perspectives. But 
I agree that it' s a good idea. In 
my own process of exploring, 
developing, and testing my 
beliefs, I've left few stones 
untumed. I've studied the Bible, 
the Quran, the Tao Te Ching and 
other texts with a ran§e of differ-
ent denominations. I ve attend-
ed a satanic rite where wine was 
served and a man was flayed, 
and also the Blue Shirt rally 
Friday evening where people 
were in amazingly high spirits 
and a great band played. 

I've meditated and gone into 
new-age stores for aura cleans-
inp and used floral essences 
and acupressure (which did 
wonders for my broken elbow 
last year). I've practiced Chaos 
Magick, Bibliomancy and 
learned to use Sigil Magick. I 
read my horoscope regularly, 
I've paid good money to get the 
lowdown from a numerologist 
(and also for half an eighth of 
shrooms that I ate with a friend 
in the woods of Santa Cruz) . I 
agree with Michael : Test your 
faith or it will have no strength, 
and once you ' ve found answers

MP3: 
RIAA's case against 
Napster is untenable 
c.tII •• d front ..... 4 

Consequently, college campus-
es everywhere, including those in 
the UC system, are banning 
Napster without student input 
even through student tuition 
funds the bandwidth that colleges 
and the RJAA presume to monitor. 
UCSD has recently blocked 
Napster because it monopolized 
bandwidth intended for educa-
tional purposes. This would be 
valid justification, except that there 
are other viable solutions to band-
width problems like the ones 
UCSD experienced. 

Companies like Lightspeed 
Systems provide college campus-
es traffic management tools that

that work for you, don't be 
afraid to share them. 

Some of you argue that the 
Blue Shirt~' message divides this 
campus: What university do you 
go to? Until this year I've never 
seen much unity at all on this 
campus, unless it was expressed 
through mutual apathy. But 
recently we've had a definite 
rise in activism, dialogue and 
participation, and the Blue Shirts 
are as much a part of that as the 
SAFErs (who organized the " No 
01122" lesbian wedding) and the 
DJs and Vinylphiles Club (who 
brought more than 5,000 people 
to a dance party at UCSD). 

So those of you who feel your 

prioritize traffic, effectively ame-
liorating surges in bandwidth 
use. In addition, education about 
Napster can prevent bloating 
servers, since many students do 
not know that leaving servers like 
Napster running eats up campus 
bandwidth. Communicating with 
the student population serves the 
school and the students better 
than censoring their Internet 
access. 

Internet censorship is not only 
menacin~ to privacy and freedom 
of speech, but in the end, it is 
also impractical. To illus~rate, the 
RIAA has recently sued the mak-
ers of Napster. This case is analo-
gous to the lawsuit brought by 
the Motion Picture Association of 
America (MPAA) that claimed 
VCRs' ability to copy movies and 
programs on television violated 
copyright laws. The MPAA lost 
the suit because, according to the 

freedoms are being impinged 
on: sorry. I don't agree with tak-
ing First Amendment protec-
tions to the point of suppression. 

I'm told that some Blue Shirts 
have surrounded questioners to 
an intimidating degree. I don't 
agree with taking evangelism to 
the point of harassment. 

I do wonder, though, where 
the line is between that kind of 
" mob" tactic and the group of 
hecklers that convenea a few 
weeks ago against Bob Smock 
(the raci t, homophobic evange-
list who preached at the Price 
Center). When Bob's female

court, it is not the fault of VCR 
companies that consumers use 
their products illegally. 

Software applications like 
Napster should not be blamed for 
the actions of consumers. Neither 
should one student be held liable 
for the actions of another. 
Furthermore, colleges in the UC 
system can succumb to RlAA 
pressure by regulating Napster, 
but, almost immediately, alterna-
tive services pop up - for exam-
ple, iMesh and Gnapster. 
Students also know how to set up 
proxy servers that circumvent the 
servers the colleges lock out. 

If the RJAA wants to reclaim the 
music industry, it must adapt to 
changing technologies through the 
creation of new business models 
rather than pursuing its stratagem 
of unjustified censorship of the 
Internet in America.

Pope Apologizes for Wrongs LEBANON: Meeting moved from 

Egypt to Bernit 

Israeli soldiers. 
The Arab League statement, 

issued after six hours of consulta-
tions, contained some of the 
harshest condemnation of Israel 
from the league in years. Among 
other things, it blasted Israel for 
its "continuing aggression" 
asaiNt Lebanon and for its 
"vicious" threats to Lebanon, a 
reference to warnings by Barak 
and the Israeli foreign minister, 
David Levy, who have promised 
further retaliation if more Israeli 
soldiers are killed before the pull-
out. 

ROME - Saying "we humbly 
ask forgiveness," Pope John Paul 
II on Sunday delivered the most 
sweeping papal apology ever, 
repenting of the errors of his 
church over the last 2,000 years. 

"We cannot not recognize the 
betrayal of the Gospel commit-
ted by some of our brothers, 
especially in the second millen-
nium," the pope, dressed in pur-
ple robes for Lent, said in his 
homily. "Recognizing the devia-
tions of the past serves to 
reawaken our consciences to the 
compromises of therresent." 

The public act 0 repentance, 
solemnly woven into the liturgy of 
Sunday Mass inside St. Peter's 
Basilica, was an unprecedented 
moment in the history of the 
Roman Catholic Church, one that 
the ailing 79-year-old pope 
pushed forward over the doubts 
of even many of his own cardinals 
and bishops. He has said repeat-
edly that the new evangelization 
he is calling for in the third millen-
nium can take place only after 
what he has described as a church-

wide "purification of memory." 
To underline the religious sig-

nificance of the apology, seven 
cardinals and bishops stood 
before the pope and singled out 
some of the key Catholic lapses, 
past and present, induding reli-
gious intolerance and injustice 
toward Jews, women, indigenous 
peoples, immigrants, the poor 
and the unborn. 

The pope, broadening a 
process of reconciliation that 
began in the 1960s during the 
Second Vatican Council, has 
issued apologies before, notably 
regretting in a 1998 document 
the failure of many Catholics to 
help Jews during the Holocaust. 
'that document disappointed 
many leading Jewish groups, 
which complained that the pope 
did not go far enough in apolo-
gizing for the silence of church 
leaders, including the wartime 
pope, Pius XU. 

Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean of 
the Simon Wiesenthal Center, 

. called Sunday's apology a "bolti 
and important step forward," 

Starr's Successor 
Readies Final Report 

WASHINGTON - Beginning 
as early as this week and contin-
uing for several months, the spe-
cial prosecutor for Whitewater 
matters, Robert W. Ray, will 
begin filing with a federal court a 
series of final reports on his 
office's investigations involving 
President Clinton and Hillary 
Rodham Clinton, lawyers who 
have been informed of the plan 
said this weekend. 

The lawyers, who are not part 
of the special counsel 's team, said 
the fi rst such report, concerning 
the improper acquisition by the 
Clinton White House of about 900 
FBI files, including many dossiers 
of prominent Republicans, is 
expected to conclude that there 
was no criminal wrongdoing and 
that the episode occurred because 
of a series of unwitting mistakes 
il)itia ted by a low-level White 
House security officer. 

Although the conclusions in 
. that report will probably not pose 
any significant problem for Mrs. 
Clinton, who is a candidate for 
the Senate in New York, Ray's 
office is planning to complete and 
file a second report, in July, about 

BUSH: 
Both sides courting 
McCain supporters 

how the Clinton White House 
came to fire several longtime 
employees of the White House 
travel office. 

Mrs. Clinton has maintained 
that she had little to do with what 
occurred, while others have told 
investigators that she played a cen-
tral rore. It remains unclear how 
Ray will reconcile the accounts. 

A third report, about issues 
stemming from the Clintons' 
investment in the Whitewater 
real estate venture before his 
presidency, is expected to be filed 
with the court in late summer, 
said the lawyers familiar with the 
schedule. 

The reports from Ray's office 
will not immediately be made 
public. Instead, as stipulated by 
law, they will be sent to the spe-
cial panel of fhree federal judges 
that oversees the operations of 
the Office of the Independent 
Counsel. The three-judge panel is 
then supposed to distribute 
copies of the reports to the many 
people who are named in them 
for comment or rebuttal.

southern Lebanon by July, ending 
a 22-year occupation. 

Although the Israeli pledge 
had been expected to improve the 
abnosphere for the Middle East 
peace talks, it has so far produced 
only recriminations from the two 
countries primarily affected by 
the Israeli pullout - Lebanon 
and Syria, which maintains 
35,000 troops here. 

The ambivalent attitudes of 
the governments in Damascus 
and Beirut were reflected in the 
communique issued by foreign 
ministers of the 22-nation Arab 
League after a meeting here in the 
Lebanese capital on Saturday. The 
meeting, held twice a year, nor-
mally in Cairo, Egypt, was shifted 
to Beirut as a show of solidarity 
after Israel destroyed three 
Lebanese power plants on Feb. 8. 
The Israeli bombing followed 
stepped-up attacks on Israeli 
troops in southern Lebanon, since

The communique said, in 
effect, that the Lebanese guerril-
las of Hezbollah, the Iran-backed 
Party of God, had every right to 
continue their attacks on Israel's 
forces since the Israelis were an 
occupying force in Lebanon, in 
defiance of 1978 U.N. Security 
Council resolution demanding 
their immediate withdrawal. 
"The Arab League fully supports 
Lebanon in its resistance and its 
fight against Israeli occupation 
until Lebanese soil is fully liberat-
ed," it said. "The resistance is the 
natural result of the occupation."

Gore Assails Bush's Proposals 
and Calls Rivall.xperienced 

DALLAS - Vice President 
AI Gore ventured into Gov. 
George W. Bush's back yard 
Sunday and hurled spears at 
him, portraying his rival as so 
inexperienced that he would 
imperil Social Security for the 
sake of an unnecessary tax cut if 
elected president. 

"Does Governor Bush have 
the experience to be presi-
dent?" Gore asked a small 
group of retirees here at an 
aSSisted-living community. 
"No. A proposal like that makes 
you wonder, because right now 
we are heading in the right 
direction with a strong econo-
my and continued prosperity." 
He said that Bush would take 
the nation in "the wrong direc-
tion" by trying to satisfy the 
wealthy special interests that 
were financing his campaign 
and wanted a tax cut. 

Gore said that if Bush cut 
taxes as much as he proposed, 
he would be forced to cut 

. Medicare, dip into the Social 
Security trust fund or cut 

money for environmental and 
education programs. In any 
case, Gore warned, Bush would 
"take us back to the Bush-
Quayle recession." 

Gore was courting voters in 
Texas and across the South this 
week in advance of a batch of pri-
qwiea on Tueeday that he will 
undoubtedly sweep. Although 
these primaries are anticlimactic 
in the aftermath of former Sen. 
Bill Bradley's withdrawal from 
the Democratic presidential race 
last week, Gore was trying to 
drive up interest in his candidacy 
and lay the groundwork for the 
fall campaign. 

Even though the election is 
eight months away, the two 
putative nominees are already 
locked in battle, and Gore is 
determined to try to define 
Bush while Bush is trying to 
define him. Bush cast Gore 
Sunday as galling in his pre-
sumption to adopt the mantle 
of campaign finance crusader, 
saying that Gore had in fact 
committed ethical lapses and 

"would say anything to get 
elected." 

Meanwhile, with Gore aides 
saying that one of the chief con-
cerns that voters harbor about 
Bush is his lack of experience, 
Gore is trying to stoke those 
doubts by portraying Bush as so 
unseasoned that he would ruin 
Social Security just to give a tax 
break to his wealthy contribu-
tors. 

Gore said he would take all of 
the Social Security surplus and 
devote it exclUSively to the 
Social Security program. 

Gore reiterated his proposal . 
to Bush that they both refuse to 
take so-called soft money, the 
unregulated donations to the 
parties, that they eliminate all 
campaign advertising and that 
they debate each other twice a 
week, Tuesday nights and 
Thursday nights at 8 p.m. He 
said this approach would 
prompt "a renaissance in our 
democracy. "

Students are given an opportunity to travel around the 
world, while visiting a number of different countries and 

attending classes on the high seas 

I t's that magical time of year again. The end of the quarter is rapidly approaching and stu-dents are realizing just how bor-ing school can be. How would you like to spice up your acade-
mic life? The Semester At Sea 

program might be just what you are 
looking for. . 

Founded in 1963, the Semester At 
Sea program has long been dedicated to 
providing students with an enriching 
atmosphere for studying and having a 
good time. In its 27-year history, 
Semester At Sea has taken over 32,000 
students to over 60 countries world-
wide.

To many people, the Semester at Sea 
program is like an urban legend. Every-
body has heard about it, but few have 
experienced it. The p~am is actually 
very real and is highly regarded by 
almost all the participants who have 
experienced it. 

On the Semester At Sea Web site, 
John P. Tymitz, chief executive officer of 
the Institute for Shipboard Education, 
summarizes the Semester At Sea pro-
gram as "much more than another 
semester at school; it is a .life..aI~ 
learning adventure. The richly varied 

international curriculum combined with 
a profound opportunity for in-country 
field work provide for an invesbnent in 
your future." 

The program takes approximately 
600 students from colleges and universi-
ties across the country around the world 
each fall and spring. 

For any senior, graduate student or 
perhaps bored instructor who feels that 
he or she might have missed out on the 
program, the Continuing Education 
Program 'allows up to 50 non-students 
on the voyage as well. . 

Among the participants in this pro-
gram are teachen on sabbatical, retirees 
and people simply seeking perso~l or 
professional enrichment in an academic 
environment.

Participants in the program also have 
access to the library, which is managed 
by the University of Pittsburgh's Hill-
man Library. It is a core library that con-
tains books which are designed to sup-
port the itinerary and international 
theme of the voyage. 

Students are housed in cabins of dou-
ble or triple occupancy. The nonstudent . 
adults involved in the Continuing Edu-
cation Program may stay in single or 
double occupancy cabins. Unens and 
blankets are provided for students, as 
well as a laundry service. 

Participants are provided with three 
meals a day and a snack during the 
semester, both while they are at sea and 
at port. 

For students interested in staying 
active, the ship also has a swimming 
pool, basketball and volleyball courts,

Associate Sports Editor 

Two weeks ago it dawned on 
me that it may just be time to 
drop out. No, not drop out of 
school - drop out of society. 

Yep, I considered just taking 
off, giving up everything and 
heading for the hills for a life of 
peaceful solitude. I wanted to 
drop out of SOCiety, IHe and this 
horrifying world. 

Why did this thought come 
fla~hing to me? It was two weeks 
ago tomorrow that a first grader 
- a first grader! - killed anoth-
er first grader in an elementary 
school in Michigan. These were 
just innocent 6-year-old children; 
children who should be spending 
their time playing tag and watch-
ing cartoons. Instead, they are 
killing each other. 

It is awful when any murder 
takes place. Now, although it 
seems impossible, murder is 
becoming even more appalling. It 
is a crime that was once reserved 
for thugs and other undesirables 
or for wartime. Then it went to the 
high school level, where disgrun-
tled teenagers began blasting 
away classmates and teachers. The 
most notable of these tragedies 
was April 20, 1999 at Columbine 
HiRh School in Colorado. 

Little was done. The issue sim-

ply disappeared from sight. 

There have been other 
instances of violence with young 
school children. Mere weeks after 
the Columbine shooting, two 
sixth-grade students were arrested 
for conspiracy to commit murder. 
The two students were making a 
hit-list of students they were going 
to kill on the last day of school. 
They got the idea from the infa-
mous duo from Columbine. We 
have now moved to a new dimen-
sion where elementary school chil-
dren are resorting to murder 
instead of harmless fistfights.

ment, claiming that regulating 
guns violates individual rights. 

I hate to disappoint people, 
but the Constitution, which is one 
of the greatest documents in the 
history of humankind, is actually 
wrong in some areas. lt was writ-
ten over 200 years ago, and some 
changes need to be made to it, 
most notably with regard to the 
right to bear arms. Frankly, the 
ability of a child to get an educa-
tion without going through a war 
zone presupposes an outdated 
right to own a weapon. 

Getting rid of the guns in 
American schools is only the 
starting point. There is something 

thing that is screwed up in Ameri-
ca. It seems that somewhere along 
the way, the entire world went 
crazy and lost perspective regard-
ing what is really important -
which brings me back to my origi-
nal statement about dropping out. 
lt would be nice to just leave all 
the chaos behind. to head to the 
mountains and live in Boulevard 
or Jamul or lOI1\ewhere like that.

I do not mean I intend to become some paranoid Y2K supply-stoelting mel who 
lives in a shack in the middle of nowhere while trying to contact space men who 
have some conspiracy against the government. No, I just mean a quiet relaxing 
life, outside of society. It)s something we all think about epery once in a while. 
Now it is being used to outline 
the outstretched corpses of Amer-
ica's youth. 

At what point will gun vio-
lence in American schools end? 
Pre-schoolers snuffing out fellow 
preschoolers? Perhaps toddlers 
will stumble upon mommy's and 
daddy's .44 and punish whoever 
took their favorite toy. 

With every tragedy, the gov-
ernment (most notably Democ-
rats) prance around and talk about 
tightening regulations regarding 
the sale of firearms. Legislation is 
passed and everyone shakes 
hands and feels good about them-
selves. Then the nightly ' news 
reports another school shooting. 
Republicans retort with an argu-
ment based on the second amend-

poisoning America, but it cannot 
be pinpointed. Despite their 
numerous benefits, television and 
the Intemet also affect society in 
negative ways, but they too are 
not the only problems. 

The weakening of the American 
family over the past 30 years is 
another problem. This country's 
morality is in the pits. I am not a 
full-OedIJ!d Christian, and I do not 
agree that the Ten Command-
ments should be taught in schooL 
but I do follow commandments 
five through 10. In short. those are 
(5) "honor your parents, (6) don't 
kill, (7) don't commit adultery, (8) 
don't steal, (9) don't bear false wit-
ness and (10) don't covet your 
neighbor's possessions. 

But morality isn't the only 

mean a quiet relaxing life, outside 
of society. It's something we all 
think about every once in a while. 

To be perfectly honest, I decid-
ed against this idea because our 
society is difficult to live in but 
impossible to live away from. 
Firat of all, I would not know how 
to sustain myself. For example, I 
would have to go back to dviliza-
lion to buy food or any number of 
other little necessities. 

Secondly, I figured others 
would follow. Alongside my shack 
would be other shacks, which 
would lead to rows of shacking. It 
would get to the point that I would 
have to move back to the city to get 
away from society again 

RealisticaUy, however, this 
would never be the real reason to 

throw in the towel and refuse to 
live within the social constructs of 
society. In any real sense, in order 
to survive, humans cannot give 
up. We must do work together to 
cure the world of this insanity -
the insanity that has first graders 
gunning down first graders. 

What will drive us to work 
together? My personal inspira-
tion comes from a touching story. 

A 90-year-old woman walked 
from California to Washington, 
D.C. to protest the lack of cam-
paign ~ reform. It took her 
about 14 months and she walked 
through poor weather, illness and 
four pairs of shoes, aU to make a 
point 

That is what the nation and 
world need; they need people to 
make stands. The ugly murder of 
a baby by a baby is significant, 
but it is actions of one woman 
that we should rally around and 
invest our energies in. 

We cannot give up this battle to 
keep society's head on straight. We 
need something like the lady walk-
ing across the country to save us. 
\Ok should feed off her strength 
and use it to stand up to the utter 
chaos that plagues our society. 

When kids kill kids, our soci-
ety barely flinches anymore. It 
has almost become common 
place. What we need to do is 
!nab a stand against this vio-
lence. We need to take action and 
ensure that our children, as well 
as our children's children, will 
not have to grow up in a world 
that allows child-on-child vio-
lence to take place. 

We can make a difference. 
Together we can take back our 
society from the violence that 
plagues it.

Not Just 'Acting' 

HOROSCOPES

to have friends over Friday. Hang

GEMINI 

May 21 - june 21 By CANDICE LEE 
Staff W'iter 

The UCSD theatre and dance 
program bases its curriculum on 
the philosophy that a complete 
education in theatre requires stu-
dents to learn about a lot more 
than just acting. 

"The liberal arts curriculum 
of the department of theatre is 
based on the belief that a good 
undergraduate education in the-
atre should provide the student 
with a solid background in dra-
matic literature and the aesthet-
ics and history of theatrical per-
formance as well as exposure to 
the different artistic components 
of the theatrical art performance, 
play writing and design," states 
the department's Web site. 

Currently the graduate 
department of theatre and dance 
is ranked third in the nation and 
is first west of the Hudson River. 

Many people assume that the 
theater major is a string of acting 
classes, whereas its curriculum 
actually encompasses a great 
variety of subjects. Classes within 
the major range from topics such 
as African American playwrights 
to effective public speaking.

for the theatre department as 
well as head of stage manage-
ment for UCSD, said UCSD's 
theater department offers classes 
for every student - including 
those who are not theater majors. 

"We offer a broad spectrum 

of classes that appeal to many 
students," Adler said. "Many of 
our students are not actors. 
Many are not declaring a spe-
cialty but are just interested in 
theatre. Students can declare a 
specialty in history, dance, stage 
management or film." 

Students who declare the the-
ater major must first choose a

and costume design. 
practicum, for which they will 
receive on-the-job experience. 
Students may choose stage man-
agement, scenery, lighting or 
costumes. After this requirement 
is fulfilled, several other classes 
follow in disciplines such as act-
ing, design, playwriting, the his-
tory of theatre and voice classes. 

Despite the efforts of the 
department, some students still 
feel that it focuses too much on 
the acting portion of theater. 
According to third-year Revelle 
student Michael Locher, the the-
atre major is mainly geared 
toward actors. 

"The major gives me some 
• I 

focus and direction to divert my 
artistic drive - it's a good out-
let ... but the major itself 
designed at UCSD is very 
biased toward actors or actress-
es," Locher said. "It's intended 
to be a broad bachelor arts 
course, but you'll find that there 
are only a small handful of 
classes that don't focus on act-
ing; there's a very wide range of 
acting classes. That in itself is 
disappointing." 

Perhaps in response to the 
opinions of students such as 
Locher, the department strives to 
provide worthwhile opportuni-
ties to those interested in more 
than just the acting portion of 
theater. Undergraduates have the 
opportunity to participate in the 
department's productions, 
including those of M.F.A. gradu-
ate students. This hands-on 
opportunity to work on quality 
productions invariably provides 
an invaluable experience to 
undergraduates. 

Participation in undergradu-
ate productions can also provide 
enlightening learning opportu-
nities for students in acting, 
stage managing and set and cos-
tume design. 

According to fourth-year Muir 
student Stacey Atkins, these 
opportunities do not go unrecog-
nized by theater students. 

"I like the major for its theo-
retical and practical impor-

SEMESTER: 
70 lower and upper 
division courses offered 
ContInued from pq. t 
dents through Cuba, Brazil, South 
Africa, Kenya,- India, Vietnam, 
Malaysia, China and Japan. 

The fall voyage departs in Sep-
tember and returns in December. 
The journey begins in Vancouver 
and travels to Japan, China, Viet-
nam, Malaysia, India, Egypt, 
Croatia, Turkey, Italy and Moroc-
co. 

The Semester At Sea program 
is also adding a Slimmer semester 
for the summer of 2000. This 65-
day trip begins and ends in 
Greece and will take students 
through Spain, Norway, Russia, 
Belgium, Portugal, Italy, Egypt 
and Israel. The trip will run from 
June 14 to Aug. 18. 
The Curriculum 

Students need not worry that 
the Semester At Sea program 
does not carry courses applicable 
to their major. The program offers 
more than 70 lower and upper-
division courses in a wide variety 
of subjects. 

While the classes offered vary 
each semester, the disciplines 
offered remain diverse. Students 
may take courses in areas rang-
ing from biological sciences, 
political science and business to 
women' s studies, theater arts 
and music. 

All participants are required to 
take the core course: Geography 
1000: Global Perspectives -
World Regional Geography. This 
class is designed to give students 
a general knowledge of the world 
to enhance their travel experi-
ence. 

The faculty also provides var-
ious seminars throughout the 
voyage concerning their native 
countries. Through these semi-

nars, as well as the core course, 
students are able to gain a 
greater appreciation for the 
places they visit. 

All of the classes offered on 
the ship are accredited by the 
University of Pittsburgh, which 
is the academic sponsor of the 
Semester At Sea program. All 
courses are fully transferable to a 
student's original college or uni-
versity. 

The classes meet daily while 
the ship is at sea.

These professors generally 
have had resident experience 
abroad, allowing them to inte-

various countries that the pro-
gram visits. This again serves to 
enrich the overall experience for

The faculty is comprised of 

very qualified professors. Almost 
all of the faculty have doctoral or 
master 's degrees. Many of them 
are simply on sabbatical from 
their normal professorship·s. 
At Port 

While at port, students can 
choose from a wide variety of 
activities. Stays in port range 
from four to six days, giving par-
ticipants in the program ample 
time to experience each destina-
tion. 

Each class has a field compo-
nent that the students must fulfill, 
but other than that the student is 
free to experience the new coun-
try. 

Among the activities offered in 
port are stays with families in the 
countries, visits to universities 
and travel to places of historic, 
cultural and religious signifi-
cance. Students are also encour-
aged to travel by themselves and 
to experience life in the ci ties and 
rural areas. 
C •• p •• life 

The Semester At Sea program 
is not solely academic. There are 
many opportunities for partici-
pants to relax and have fun. 

There are various clubs and 
student organizations available 
for students to participate in 
during their semester abroad 
Among the standing clubs are 
the Students of Service, Ambas-
sadors Club, Sea Watch News (a 
television news program that is 
shown on the closed-circuit tele-
visions), Drama Club and year-
book. 

Since new students arrive 
every semester, there is a natural 
change in the types of clubs 
offered. Some of these clubs may 
include language enthusiasts, 
chess players, photographers or 
ecologicaJ activists. 

There are also various social 
activities for eager participants.

Students Warned to Use Caution While Traveling 
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright urges students to learn local laws and behave accordingly 
By JESSICA ICHEPPMANN 
Features Editor 

Spring break and summer 
vacation are times when a dispro-
portionate number of students 
gear up for traveling abroad. 
Although there are many benefits 
to visiting countries around the 
world, the U.S. Department of 
State, Bureau of Consular Affairs 
warns that safety must be a top 
concern. 

encouraged to know the location 
of the nearest U.s. Embassy or 
Consulate in each country they 
visit in case of emergency. 

"U students are going to be in 
a country for more than a couple 
of weeks, they should register at 
the American Embassy or Con-
sulate," states the U.s. State 
Department Web site. "This is 
helpful to students and their fam-
ilies if there is need to locate fam-
ily members in the event of an 
emergency. " 

When traveling, students need 
to be sure to keep their passports 
handy and to fill in the emer-

ment and current political situa-
tion of each country. Learning 
about the local laws and obeying 
them makes travel a lot easier 
and safer, according to the State 
Department. 

Students are also encouraged 
to avoid local demonstrations or 
civil disturbances because they 
could tum anti-American.

Usually international trips are 

safe and relatively uneventful, 
but unfortunately a number of 
vacations abroad are ruined 
every year by drunken and disor-
derly behavior. 

has been arrested in a foreign 
country. 

"Each year, many American 
students serve time in foreign 
jails or await trial in detention 
because they were unaware of 
the risks of using or possessing 
drugs while overseas," stated 
Albright. "Many young Ameri-
cans are also arrested in foreign 
lands because of inappropriate 
behavior associated with heavy 
drinking." 

In the case of an emergency, 
the American Consulate can give 
a list of local aHorneys and notify 
a student's family and relay 

The Bureau of Consular 
Affairs helps Americans abroad 
ensure that their rights are not 
being violated. According to its 
Web page, U.S. consular officers 
can help travelers obtain 'new 
passports in case of emergencies 
and can help family members 
locate and contact travelers 
abroad. For travelers who are 
arrested, consular officers can 
provide aid, but cannot intervene 
to get travelers out of the country 
or act as an attorney for someone 
who has been arrested. 

According to the U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs, more 
than 2,500 American citizens are arrested abroad each year - more than half 
of those art on narcotics charges, including possession of pery smallllmounts of 
illegal substances. Of these 2,500, 880 will end up sening time in jails abroad. 

"The State Department's 
Bureau of Consular Affairs is 
responsible for the protection 
and welfare of U.S. citizens 
abroad," stated Madeleine 
Albright, U.S. Secretary of State, 
in an annual press release. "But 
while U.S. consular officers can 
visit American citizens being 
held in foreign jails, they cannot 
get them released." 
"., ...... 

Students are encouraged to act 
responsibly when traveling 
abroad, according to the Bureau. 
Students should read the State 
Department's Consular informa-
tion sheet for each country they 
plan to visit. Travelers are also 

gency page of them. Close fami-
lies of students traveling abroad 
are also encouraged to have up-
to-date passports in case an emer-
gency requires them to travel 
abroad. Travelen should also 
make a copy of their passport's 
data page and any visas and 
should keep those copies separate 
from their original papers. Leav-
ing a copy at home with relatives 
or friends is also recommended in 
the event that a replacement pass-
port is needed. 

The Department of State pub-
lishes background notes on coun-
tries worldwide. These packets 
are available for over 170 coun-
tries and contain information 
regarding the culture, history, 
geography, economy, govern-

According to the U.S. Depart-
ment of State, Bureau of Consular 
Affairs, more than 2,500 Ameri-
can citizens are arrested abroad 
each year - more than hall of 
.thoee are on narcotics charges, 
including possession of very 
small amounts of illegal sub-
stances. Of these 2,500, 880 will 
end up serving time in jails 
abroad. 

Often a traveler will obtain 
goods in one country and then 
transport them to another coun-
try. Unfortunately, what may be 
acceptable or even legal in one 
country is a prosecutable offense 
in a neighboring country. 
According to the American Con-
sulate, there is very little that 
anyone can do for someone who 

requests for money or aid, but 
only with the studenrs authoriza-
tion. It can also intercede with 
local authorities to make sure that 
the arrested person's riahts under 
local Jaw are respectecl and that 
he or she is treated humanely 
according to . internationally 
accepted standards. 

An arrest can mean intense 
interrogation, lengthy trials or 
two years to life in prison . In 
Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Pakistan, 
Turkey and Thailand a drug 
arrest constitutes the death penal-
ty. Travelers who plan on partak-
ing in local deligflts are strongly 
urged to read up on local laws 
and customs. 

More and more, students 
abroad are encountering situa-

tions where they can easily make 
a Jot of money by carrying drugs 
from one po~t to another. Travel-
ers are strongly urxed to resist the 
temptation to mab easy money 
because in doing so, they are r;tting themselves in danger. 
............ ,,' .. 
People injured while travel-

ing abroad can also get help 
from these officers. A U.S. Con-
sular officer can assist in locat-
ing appropriate medical services 
and Informing family and 
friends or assist in the transfer of 
funds from the United States. 
Payment for services, however, 
is the responsibility of the tra vel-
er. Travelers are encouraged to 
learn what medical services their 
health insurance will cover over-
seas. Remember to carry a claim 
form and a policy identity card 
as proof of such insurance. A 
traveler with any pre-existing 
condition should carry 3 leHer 
from the attending physician 
describing the medical treatment 
and prescription medication 
needed.

eling abroad go to

UCSD Faces Double Trouble 
TENNIS: On the clay courts, the Tritons can't muster effective doubles 
play and fall to their rivals, the University of Redlands, 2-5 
By IIILL IURIER 
sports Editor 

The best thing I can liken to 
the UCSD men's tennis team's 
feeling is the feeling one would 
have after waking up on 
Christmas morning to f1J\d 
that Santa Claus has taken 
the year off. 

All year long the 
Tritons have waited 
for their chance to 
battle University 
Redlands. This time 
around, UCSD felt it had a 
chance to defeat its hated 
rivals. Alas, these chances did 
not materialize and the Tritons 
fell 2-5. 

"They are a pretty Kood team," 
Head Coach Eric S"teidlmayer 
said of Redlands. "We knew it 
would be a close match and it 
was. We just hoped it would be a 
little closer." 

All in all, Steidlmayer &aid he 
was pleased with the play of his 
team with the exception of the 
team's doubles play. 

"The main thing that troubles 
me is that we didn't perform in 
doubles," Steidlmayer said. MOur 
No. 1 team played exc~tionally, 
but the other two didn t play at 
the level I am used to them play-
ing at." 

The No. 1 team he was refer-
ring to is the duo of Corey 
Moderhak and Mike Rosett. 
These two established themselves 
as the Tritons' best team by crush-
inf the No. 1 team from Redlands 
8-. 

At two doubles, Michael 
Meyer and Dan Albrecht fell to 

their opponents 8-3 and Ari 
Frankel and Ryan Thompson lost 
8-4 at number three doubles. 

After losing two of the three 
doubles sets, the Tritons found 
themselves down 1-0 after the 
doubles portion of the match. 

In singles, the Tritons per-
fonned well at the top but 

had problems in the 
lower levels. 

At number one 
singles, Meyer 
defeated Michael 

Mashburn of Redlands 
6-3, 6-3. Mashburn was 

rankecilOth best player in the 
region, so the victory was a big 
one for Meyer. The Win'luts him 
in position to conten for the 
regIonal individual champi-
onship at the end of the season. 

At number two singles, 
Moderhak took his opponent out 
6-4, 6-4 in relatively standard 
fashion. 

"We looked great at the top," 
Steidlmayer said. "Corey and 
Michael had big wins for us." 

At number three singles, 
Albrecht had a rough go of it and 
lost 3-6, 1-6. Albrecht, who was 
injured during the early part of 
the season. is still getting back 
into match form. Look for better 
performances from him in the 
near future. -

The most exciting match of 
the day was at number four sin-
gles. Rosse! and his opponent, 
Jesse Medvene-Collins from 
Redlands, played to a 6-6 tie in 
the first set. Rosett lost in a tie-
breaker 7-1 to go down one set to 
none. Instead of hanging his 
head and pouting, Roset! 

showed what he is made of and 
took the third set 6-3. In the 
tourth set Rosett was down early 
but fought back again to make it 
close. In the end, he didn't have 

enou~ as he fell 4-6 in the set to 
lose the match. 

"Mike has been hurt but he 
played a great dot1bles match and 
a solid singles match," 
Steidlmayer said. "Not playing 
singles for a while probably hurt 
him" 

At number five singles, Ryan 
Thompson had an off day and fell 
2-6,2-6. 

Ari Frankel had a tough 
match at number six singles but 
battled hard to make it close. He 
got to a tie-breaker in the first set 
but after losing that 7-2, he ran 
out of gas and lost 6-2 in the sec-
ond set. 

U Arl battled hard," 
Steidlmayer said. "He just didn't 
have quite enough. I think that 
[Redlands] may have stacked 
number six because the guy he 
played looked better than a few 
of their other players." 

After the loss, the Tritons find 
themselves ranked fifth in the 
region and looking for answers. 

The Tritons' next match is 
today against Denison 
University of Ohio. UCSD will 
be looking to improve upon its 
doubles play after the last 
match's less than spectacular 
performances ir this depart-
ment. The match promises to be 
a good one as Denison is ranked 
13th in the nation in Division Ill. 
Gather your strength and spirit 
and get out to Muir's North 
Courts to root for UCSD.

POLO: 
Team will continue to 
work hard this season 
ContInued from ..... 24 

While this weekend's 
matchup was obviously no luau 
for the UCSD squad there were 
plenty of moments of inspired 
play that boded well for the 
future. The players showed a lot 
of strength early on in the match, 
and if they can sustain that 
intensity over the duration of 
their future games, the team 
should be very successful. 

"We stuck with them and 
played strong early on. Even late 
in the game in the third and 
fourth quarter we had some key 
chances that if we had capital-
ized [on them), we would have 
been right in there," Triton

good part of the game as they 
went · into the eighth inning 
down 5-2. One Triton player 
atttibuted the team's slow start 
to the Redland heat and a bit of 
disappOintment from the previ-
ous loss to Montclair. 

In a reversal of fortune, the 
Tritons tagged Redlands for 
eight runs in the final two 
innings to win 10-6. 

"We came out flat in the 
beginning," head coach Dan 
O'Brien said. "We' re a scrappy 
team though and we rallied late 
and got the win." 

Matt Smith laid down a beau-
tiful squeeze bunt in the eighth 
to score a run and Terrell hit a 

Coach Larry Sanders said. 
Still we are a young squad 

and that sort of thing comes with 
experience. The team is working 
extremely hard in practice and 
definitely getting better every 
time we go out there." With the 
loss, the 12th-ranked Tritons' 
record falls to 5-11. With 
increased vigor out of its play-
ers, the team will undoubtedly 
improve upon that mark in the 
weeks to come. The Tritons plan 
to practice feverishly all week in 
anticipation of a big upcoming 
weekend. They will be taking 
part in the Claremont College 
Tournament where they should 
definitely be making their pres-
ence felt. 

Playing against some tearns 
with similar experience, Sanders 
is confident. 

"This weekend will give us a 
chance to come out and release 
some aggression, execute, and 

double that scored two runs and 
along with Chad Addison and 
Chris Tallman, went 3-5 in the 
game. 

Both Terrell and Addison 
credit the Triton pitching during 
the middle innings, in the form 
of Alex Cremidan, for keeping 
the team in the game until its 
bats could wake up. 

"Cremidan came up with 
three big scoreless innings for 
us," O' Brien said. 

The Tritons are 8-1 in their 
last nine games, and next week 
travel to Point Lorna Nazarene 
for a Tuesday game, and then 
face Riverside at home on 
Wednesday and away on 
Thursday. 

Coach Dan O' Brien believes 
that if his team stays alert and 
ready to play, they should have 
no trouble with the opposition. 
"As long as we prepare to come 
out and play hard, we can be as 

The UCSD Guardian 

pick up some wins," Sanders 
said. The team lately has been 
playing strong and it isn't reflect-
ed in our record as we've been up 
against some of the strongest 
tearns in the nation. This week-
end I expect to be very success-
ful ." 

Tl,te mood in the locker room 
is upbeat and hungry as the 
team feels that this weekend will 
be the time to show the rest of 
the intercollegiate circuit that it 
is not to be taken lightly but a 
force to be reckoned with. 

Following· this weekend's 
matches, the Tritons will travel 
to Redlands for the all-important 
Women's Western Water Polo 
Association Championship to be 
held at the University of 
Redlands. The Tritons look to 
build on the momentum of their 
improving play to make a splash 
in this tourney, which pits the 
UCSD squad against the other 

good as we wallt to be," O'Brien 
said . "If we don' t do those 
things, there's a good chance 
that other tearns can sneak up 
and beat us." 

In addition, the Tritons have 
been consistently challenging 
their opponents in areas where 
one would not expect. "Because 
we're a real scrappy team, we 
show a lot of aggreSSiveness. 
We're good at putting pressure 
on the defense and the pitcher, 
O'Brien said." 

The Tritons show toughness 
in these alternative areas of skill 
by having pulled many double 
steals this season such as the one 
versus Montclair State when the 
Tritons stole second and home in 
one play. 

Going into the next game ver-
sus Point Lorna Nazarene, the 
Tritons now hold an overall 
record of 9-2. Come out on 
Wednesday to cheer on UCSD. 

PREVIEW: 
Expect different faces 
in World Series 
CcIIItIIIued from ..... 24 
Klesko, et aI, and their bullpen is 
one of the best in the league led 
by Trevor Hoffman. 

The Padres' only question 
mark is their starting pitching, 
but I believe their pitchers will 
answer any questions about their 
abilities. Sterling Hitchcock is 
solid and Matt Clement is still 
growing and should continue the 
strong performances he had dur-
ing the second half of last season. 
Woody Williams had some good 
outings last year also, and I 
believe the other additions to the 
Padre pitching staff should make 
for a strong starting five. The 
Padres surprised a lot of folks two 
years ago when they made the 
World Series. Perhaps they can do 
it again this season. 

5) I hope some club other than 
the Yankees or the Braves will 
compete for the World 
Championship. I'm tired of see-
ing owners with fat wallets buy-
ing championships. Perhaps we' ll 
see some small market club fight-
ing for a World Series crown. 

I would go out on a limb and 
say the Pads will grab the ring, 
but I think that is an unrealistic 
prediction. I foresee a rematch of 
the classic 1975 series between 
the Reds and the Boston Red Sox. 
We might not see a moment as 
dramatic as Carlton Fisk's game-
winning homerun which tied the 
series at three games ilpiece, but it 
will still be quite a match up. In 
this year 's series, I see Griffey and 
the Reds coming out on top. It 
will be the most exciting fall clas-
sic seen in a while. 

Spring is a time for dreams. All 
teams and fans have them. These 
are just a small few of mine.

Sweet Dreams Are 
Made of This 

Spring is fast approaching 
and the weather is ge!ting 
warmer - well, for the most 
part. Nonetheless, one thing is 
for sure: The 2000 Major 
League Baseball season is 
creeping up on us. 

A few weeks ago, the 30 
major league teams opened 
camp and all of them have 
expectations to win the World 
Series, whether those expecta-
tions are realistic or not. 

Every player, no matter 
how big or small, starts off 
with the mentality of being on 
an even playing field where 
anything can happen. With 
that in mind, here is a list of 
five things that I would like to 
see happen in the 2000 base-
ball season. 

1) I can't wait to witness the 
reaction of ew York Met fans 
once the Atlanta Braves' John 
Rocker takes the mound for 
the first time in Shea Stadium. 
After those bigoted comments 
directed toward certain 
groups in ew York, he's 
going to get an earful when he 
plays there. 

You almost have to feel 
sorry for him. Okay, not really 
- the guy is a jerk and 
deserves whatever he is going 
to get from Mets fans. They 
will surely hand down a 
stronger penalty than that of 
the weak arbitrator who gave 
him a $500 fine and a two-
week suspension. 

Now, I am not openly pro-
moting violence, but I wonder 
if the Mets organization is 
planning to give away free 
baseballs to the 60,000 fans in 
attendance the day the Braves 
visit. Those balls could be put 
to very good use by fans. 

2) 71. That is how many 
homeruns I look for Cincinnati 
Red Ken Griffey Jr. to hit this 
season. I know, 71 is an outra-
geous number. But so is the 70 
that Mark McGwire slugged a 
few seasons ago. Barring 
injury, Junior should be able to 
do it. He has shown his ability 
in the past. 

For instance, back during 
the strike shortened season of 
'94, Griffey was on pace to . 
shatter the homerun record. 
He's happy to be back in 
Cincinnati, where he played as 
a child, and opposing pitchers 
are the ones who will be pay-
ing the price. 

3) I hope to see the L.A. 
Dodgers come in last and $105 
million man Kevin Brown lose 
20 games. It is unlikely that 
Brown, as good as he is, will 
have such a horrible year. 
However, it is always good to 
maintain hope that the 
Dodgers will fall flat on their 
overpaid faces. They under-
acheived last year. There's no 
reason to think that they will 
not do so this season as well. 

4) I look to see the Padres 
surprise everyone and take !,he 
National League West. They 
have a good team and their 
bats are strong - Tony 
Gwynn, Brett Boone, Ryan

UCSD Bats Awaken for Eight 
COMEBACK: The baseball team scores eight runs to beat Redlands on the road after trailing 5-2 
By TAIT MlUER 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD men's baseball 
team came away with a split last 
week, losing 7-6 in a heartbreaker 
against the Redhawks of 
Montclair State but rallying from 
a 5-2 deficit in the eighth to defeat 
the University of Redlands. 

The sun was shining and

for home and made it easily. 

The Tritons were able to run at 
will on Friday against both 
Redhawk catchers as they stole 
five bases while being caught 
only once. 

Triton right-fielder Terrell 
attributed UCSD's base-stealing 
success against Montclair to two 
simple factors. 

field last Friday as the ..bI-"'~ 
"Their pitcher had a 

slow release and the 
Tritons faced Montclair 
at home. 

The game started 
out slow as both sides 
went down in order in 
the first. In the top of the 
second, George Gallagher 
stepped up to the plate for 
Montclair, clobbering one to left 
center off of John Beaven. The ball 
sailed over the fence to give 
Montclair a 1-0 lead. 

It was Gallagher 's third home 
run in as many at-bats. 

However, in the bottom half of 
the inning, Tyler Sullivan stepped 
up to the plate for UCSD and con-
tinued his hot streak. Already 
hovering around the .600 mark, 
Sullivan hit a shot to right field 
that flew over t~e right field wall 
faster than a rabbit with wings, 
tying the game 1-1. 

Beaven then turned up the 
heat, recording seven strikeouts 
to shut Montclair down until the 
eighth inning. 

Helping out its pitcher, the 
Triton offense tagged Redhawk 
starter Greg Belson for two more 
runs in the bottom half of the 
fourth. 

With two outs, Sullivan sin-
gled to left field and Brian Terrell 
then reached base on an error by 
the Redhawk second baseman. 
Jess Warrington drove in a run 
with a single. 

Next, the Tritons executed a 
beautiful piece of baseball strate-
gy: the double steal. Warrington 
took second and when the catcher 

catcher didn't have that 
great an arm," Terrell 
said. "We just got the 
right guys on and 

kept taking bags." 
In the eighth inning, 

Montclair finally got to 
Beaven. Although looking a little 
tired, Beaven could have been 
the victim of bad calls by the 
home plate umpire in the eighth. 
The umpire, who had been call-
ing the wide strike all day long, 
seemed to finally realize where 
the plate was - on a few pitches, 
which looked like strikes the 
inning before, were called as 
balls in the eighth. The 
Redhawks took advantage of 
this and scored two runs on a 
walk and two hits. 

The Tritons seemed poised to 
score in the bottom of the eighth 
as Todd Scherwin was at second 
with one out, but the Redhawks 
brought in their sidearm closer 
Steve Trongone to stymie the 
Triton threat. 

In the top half of the ninth, 
Montclair mounted four runs to 
take a 7-4 lead. With one run 
already in and the score tied 4-4. 
Brian Hinson, who has done an 
excellent job out of the pen for 
the Tritons, came in with the 
bases loaded and forced a ground 
ball to first that should have 
ended the inning. UCSD got the 
out at home but an errant throw 
for the second out from Sullivan, 
the Triton catcher, allowed two 
more runs to score. Montclair

tacked on another run with a sac-
rifice bunt. 

The Tritons made a valiant 
effort in the bottom of the ninth, 
grinding out two runs off two hit 
oatsmen, two walks and a field-
er's choice. With two out, 
Sullivan spanked one to right 
field for what looked like a sure 
hit and game-tying RBI, but the
