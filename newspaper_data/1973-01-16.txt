Columnist Anderson'Discusses Peace Talks, Press, FBI 
fBI surveillance, the peace ta lk 

stalemate, and government inhibition 
of the press were subjects discussed by 
Washington columnist Jack Anderson 
last Friday during a lunchtime meeting 
with TRITON TIMES staff members. 

Anderson, syndicated columnist of 
"The Washington-Merry-Go-Round", 
printed in over 700 newspapers, and 
whose column has exposed the 
machinations of foreign policy during 
the India-Pakistan crisis, the connec-
tions between former Senator George 
Murphy with the Technicolor Cor-
poration, and the improper use of 

funds by late Connecticut Senator 
Thomas Dodd, believes that the press is 
in an uncomfortable position because 
President Nixon feels that he is being 
abused. 

" Ron Ziegler (Presidential Press 
Secretary) can lie to the American 
public with impunity; but if I put a 
comma out of place, they trap me", 
said Anderson. 

The biggest comma out of place for 
Anderson was his premature release of 
false facts that indicated Senator 
Thomas Eagleton had had several 
drunk driving violations, but ·this faux 
pas was mitigated by Anderson 's 
receipt of the Pulitzer Prize for his 
revealing exposure of how aAmerican 
foreign policy is made. 

of opium over a dung heap, Anderson 
immediate ly exposed the U.S. position 
as a type of cuckold in the Thai decep-
tion. In reveal ing that the U.S. had 
spe nt so much money in an uncon-
summated arrange ment, Anderso n 
had incurred the wrath of several tax-
payers who wired the White House. 

The White House immediately called 
a Press Conference to " clarify" the 
Thailand scandal, and they had eve n 
procured a " witness who swore he was 
the re wh e n" the inci ne ratio n took 
place", said Anderson . But Anderson 's 
aide, les Whitte n, was busy passing o ut 
Xeroxes of the secret document that 
supported Anderson's contention that 
the U.S. had been duped to the con-
fused reporte rs in attendance. " We 
stole the show", recalled Anderson, 
smiling. 

(concerning Nixon 's gift of a tactical 
play for the Dolphins in last year's 
Superbowl), "I would think that the 
President has something better to do 
tha n to meddle with football games." 
He then reflected, "The president· 
probably read some poll that indicated " 
that mo re people li ke football than any 
other spo rt and that's probably what 
has insp ired his interest in the game." 

With little pressure, Anderson con-
fessed that he favored the Redskins for 
the Superbowl, but, as in the Eagleton 
affair, time has proven him wrong 
again. 

As a result of his . nonpartisan 
revelations of scandal in Washington, 
Anderson said, " like all controversial 
people, I'm often under surveillance 
by the FBI. But fortunately I have a 
friend in the fBI who informs me when 
the surveillance is being made and 
even gives me the li cense plate 
numbers of the government agents." 
As soon as Anderson receives the 
li cense numbers, he dispatches each of 
his n ine children, equ ipped with 
cameras, to locate the cars and to take 
pictures of the agents. 

Anderson lamented that, " We are 
no t as close to peace as we were last 
October. There was a breakdown in 
communicatio n and the Jo int Chiefs of 
Staff could not see their way fit to 
accepting Kissinger's proposed peace 
agreements. Now all that Kissinger's 
doing is re-breaking the ground he 
already broke last October." 

Columnist Jack Anderson 

At times Anderson has had triumphs 
over the "obfuscating" White House 
News Staff. When he learned that the 
U.S. had given Thailand $1 million to 
burn a considerable amount of opium, 
and that the Thai government had met 
the agreement by sprinkling small bits 

Con ti nui ng on the subject of Viet-
nam, Anderso n added that the "North 
Vietnamese governme nt has to be the 
mos t re pressive an d o pp ressive 
governme nt in the world .. . they actual-
ly have a clause in their constitution 
that enables them to shoot someone 
for counterrevolutio nary thought."

Shockley, Thomas Debate 
"Genetic Inferiority" 

Rick Drom 
Are blacks less intelligent than whites due to a 

genetic inferiority? 
Dr. William Shockley, Stanford Physicist and Nobel 

laureate, supported this hypothesis in a discussion 
Sunday with Dr. Charles Thomas, a Black psychologist 
at Third College and Dr . B.J. Williams, an 
anthropologist. 

Shockley explained his controversial theory to an 
overflowing audience1n the Emerson Unitarian Church 
of Canoga Park. Shockley said that through 1.0. tests he 
had shown that somes, notably blacks, are genetically 

. deficient in terms of intelligence. He viewed as alar-
ming the statistics that uneducated blacks raised, on 
the average, 4.7 childre n as opposed to college-
educated blacks who raised 1.9 children per family. 

According to an article in Newsweek, "he projects 
that the fraction of the U.S. black population suffering 
from mental retardation for genetic reasons, may well 
be doubling in about twenty years. One way of putting 
this, he said, is that by good intentions we may 
unwittingly be breeding Deltas - in the fashion of 
Huxley's 'Brave New World.' We may be breeding 
problem creators in greater percentage than problem 
solvers." 

Dr. Thomas, known as "The Father of Black 
Psychology", attacked Shockley'S arguments along with 
Dr. Williams. Thomas began by denouncing the in-
telligence tests themselves as "culturally biased in the 
direction of Anglo-conformity." He said that in-
telligence cannot be measured with present tests and 
that these very tests have placed "substantlal numbers 
of children of color, on the basis of 1.0. in classes for 
the' retarded when these children were actually men-
tally competent." 

Thomas said that Shockley has "conslstently refused 
to answer or recoilnlze" many challenges. "Statistical 
procedures or scientific practice generally can not be 
separated from contamination by the human element", 
he said. "As Intelligence Is currently defined and 
measured, Innate ability can not be supported as a 
statistic concept for any group of people. At the very 

best one can give inferences that are little better than 
educated guesses which become agr~ed upon over 
times by those who see things in much the same 
manner." 

Shockley, according to Newsweek, favors action to 
halt " dysgenic evolution." " One plan that he th inks 
might be fruitfully discu sed is the payment of Federal 
cash bonuses to inte llectually substandard blacks and 
whites who agree not to have children. He also fa vors 
the establishment of special educational and socia l 
programs geared to substandard individuals of both 
races." 

A possible plan would be to pay a person $1 ,000 fo r 
each point below 100 in which their 1.0. was recorded 
if they agreed not to have any children. Shockley 
reasoned that it would save money if these people 
were paid to not have genetica lly inferio r children 
rather than have to care for " these moronic chi ldren." 

In response to this idea, Thomas proposed that 
Shockley "extend his arguments and evide nce about 
eugenics to cover personality traits." In th is way, 
Thomas felt that Shockley should "advocate a steriliza-
tion program for Anglo males who possess personal ity 

I traits of dominance and aggression ." 
"Anglo males with abundant dominance and aggres-

sion traits tend to be those who are highly educated , 
the products of marriage, and members of families with 
few children. For these victims a genetic screening 
mandate is essential because their behavior involves 
the following destructive patterns : the compulsive 
craving for power in order to control others through 
oppression; the competitive need to exploit people 
who are different because of age, sex, or race; the 
inability to establish human relationships; an insatiable 
need to develop behavioral patterns dependent upon 
either parasitic relationships or the destruction of other 
people (particularly those considered less than hum-
na); and the contempt for the rational aspects of 
society." 

Since the "sickness of our society" can be traced to

Bombing Halt 
in-Vietnam 

President Nixon ordered a halt today to all offensive 
military operations in North Vietnam " because of the 
progress made " in the Pa ris peace talks, reports from 
the Florida White House said. 

Press Secretary Ron Ziegler said Nixon 's order took 
effect at 10 a.m. and includes the halting of " bombing, 
shelling, and any further mining of North Vietnam." 

Ziegler described the move as a " un ilatera l gesture" 
that followed a Presidential assessme nt of the war. 

Defining 'Peace 
With Honor' 

Not only has Nixon 
refused to face the 
American people and ex-
plain his unprecedented 
military esca lati o n, but 
Washington has ordered 
"one of the most stringent 
news blackou ts of the 
war." (New York Time , 
Dec. 27, 1972) As part of the 
news blackout, President 
Nixon will not give his State 
of th e Unio n addr ess 
before the people of th is 
country. The address will 
not be del ivered in perso n 
before Congress, nor will it 
be televised. In light of th is 
blackout a ma sive teach-in 
has been organized on th 
UCSD campus. The teach-
in will address itself to th i 
and other questions: 

why were the heaviest 
bom bi ng s of th e war 
launched one week after 
Kissinger said peace was 
99'1. as ured? 

Why d id ixon reneg on 
his campaign " promise" to 
si gn t h e 9- Point Peace 
Program ? 

And what, in fact , is 
" peace with honor" ?

Dear ones: 

" Pig Ta les" is an attempt

munity easier . By the 
presentation of the Sheriff 
and Deputies as just plain 
folk doing a necessary job, 
ye olde publick relations 
will attempt to gloss over 
the fact that the Sheriff's 
Departmnet is primarily a 
tool of the ruling class . This 
is rather akin to having P.R. 
men for the U.S, Air Force 
in Vietnam. 

" Pig Tales" is well named 
insofar as the " Pig" has 
become a symbol of the 
oppressor of increasingly ' 
1Ilienated peoples . I don 't 
call Sheriff's Deputies pigs.

won't hesitate to kill those

with bullets, crude though 
such action may be. It 
would appear that such 
times are fast approaching, 
unless we can peaceably 
socialize our planetary 
economic systems, and 
otherwise adapt to the flow 
of conscious life. As far as I 
can see, " Pig Tales" is not 
one of those adaptations. 
" Pig Tales" will not serve as 
a communication link with 
the County Sheriff 's

All-Cal Nex l 
Spik rs Drop Close One 

Last Friday night the Triton Volleyball team surprised 
everyone, including themselves, by winning two quick 
games against their older and more experienced rivals, 
FRIENDS. Unfortunately, they dropped the next three

games to lose the night's match as well as Coch 
Gorrell's beer bet. 

The FRIENDS, as ment ioned before, are not un-
familiar to UCSD, consisting primarily of grad students 
and former varisty volleyball players, including the two 
rookie coaches Dick Reitherman and Jeff Gorrell. 

The first game featured a strong defense and some 
rather unbelievable hitting by freshman Larry Baldwin 
who kept bouncing spikes past the opposing block. 
Both starting setters, coincidentally both freshmen, 
Larry and George Yamashita, were putting the ball right 
up for the big guns, Maurice Serracini, Jim Rabe, Matt 
Merliss, and Mike Bostiani. But the Tritons never really 
got a strong offense ogether and had to rely on an 

. unusually effective block , some slightly better than 
average digging, and numerous mistakes by their 
opponents, which helped more than anything else . 

The second game introduced the two biggest 
members of the team, Clain Campagna and John 
"lemon Grove" Woodward, who kept up the blocking. 
Coming back from a three point deficit, the Tritons fell 

Page 4 Triton Times Tuesday, January 16, 1973 

over victory once again and Coch Gorrell's smile 
widened perceptibly. 

The third game? Well , in the interest of charity little 
will be said; suffice it to say the good guys (that'S the 
Tritons for you skeptics) were handily defeated. The 
fourth game provided the most excitement as the lead 
bounced back and forth several times. In the end, 
however, the Tritons managed to choke on a three . 
point lead and the FRIENDS pulled it out once again. 
The Tritons tried to make a run for the match in the 
final game, gasping for that beer, but the setting of 
Maurice and impressive net work of Campagna (who 
stuffed Coach Reitherman twice) was not enough to 
overcome the generally weak play of the Tritons. 

The crowd was impressive showing that volleyball 
players have more friends than the average fan thinks, 
at least two or three per man. They saw a team that had 
either improved tremendously in a matter of days or 
played way over their heads, hopefully the former. The 
Tritons will get eheir first real test this weekend when 
they travel up to UC Davis for the All-Cal and face the 
likes of UCLA and UC Santa Barbara. This trip should 
furnish the Tritons with some much needed experience 
against top flight teams. After the All-Cal the team 
returns home to the San Diego Barn, otherwise known 
as the municipal gymnasium, to play against various 
teams from the San Diego area . The gym is easily 
characterized as a barn because of its ample space and 
lack of light and heating facilities .

-1M Basketball 
Jams the Gym 

Men's and Pee Wee basketball appear to be a 
gourmet's delight as the Intramural Department has 
cooked up some tasty (tasteless?) league names to spice 
up the basketball season. The creations of Jimmy 
Roudebush, who, in addition to his other duties as 
Intramural Assistant and General Nuisance, has taken 
on the role of Chief Chef, include the Wiener Schnitzel 
Piccata League and the Gouda Burst League. The 
popularity of intramural sports is nowhere more evi-
dent than during round ball season, where this year 56 
Men's and Pee Wee teams sig ned up to play on only 
the third day of the quarter . Play is under way already; 
.the gym schedule is so full this quarter that several 
games will have to be played outside as there is just not 
enough court space for everyone who wants to play. 

Part of the reason things are so packed is that coed 
basketball is back for its sophomore season with 24 
teams. This 3 girl-2 guy game is an amazing combina-
tion of confusion, crazy rules, and occasionally a 
glimpse of coordination . It's tough to know which 
teams will play this game with any degrree of proficien-
cy, but CAMEL's HUMPS may be insurmountable in the 
Listerine League. It's rumored that the KLAP may 
dominate the Pristine league as all of its opponents 
have threatened to forfeit in order to avoid "social 
contact. " Scouting reports say that POONTANG 
MERINGUE (rumored to be Wonder Boy's favorite 
dishl is a real pushover and can be ,licked by anyone. 

VOLLEYBALL & COED SOCCER 
SIGN-UPS THIS WEEK 

This afternoon at 4 o'clock intramural volleyball gets 
underway with the captain's meeting in the gym 
classroom. This quarter we'll have both open sixes and 
coed doubles competition. Games will be Thursday 
nights and for all you volleyball freaks, this will be 
about the only time the courts will be open during the 
quarter . 

Foot fetishists also get theirs this week . Coed soccer 
has its captain's meeting Thursday at 4. Those of you 
who want to get your kicks, be there I

Streak Broken 
By USD Five 

Pat Slacy 

The UCSD basketball team finally tasted the sour 
pang of defeat S.ATURDAY NIGHT AFTER AMASSING 
AN AMAZING STRING OF EIGHT STRAIGHT -
VICTORIES. The defeat came at the hands of a very 
talented USD team the night after a warm-up game for 
the aforementioned loss . 

Friday night saw the cagers traveling north to the Los 
A.ngeles area to take on the Pacific Christian five . They 
disposed of them much more handily than the final 
score, 64-52, might indicate. The Tritons started off fast 
taking a quick 10-0 lead, aided by their blitzing full~ 
court press . This start enabled them to coast the rest of 
the way while limbering up for their big contest against 
the Toreros of USD. The cagers were led by center Pau l 
Trainer with 24 points and forward Gie Simpson who 
racked up 12 tallies. '

Trees. Photos: Eastern. 

~opes were up Friday night, but Saturday evening 
qUickly brought the Tritons down to earth. USD went 
ahead early - after the Tritons took a 2-0 lead - and 
continually increased the difference as they wracked 
up the home team for their first defeat in nine games 
The final score was "a lot" to "a lesser amount" ....: 
about 20 points less to be exact - and we won't say 
anymore about that touchy subject. 

The largest home crowd ever to attend a game In the 
U.CSD gym was treated to quite a few exciting talent 
dlsplSlYS. On the court, USD displayed its awesome 
rebounding strength as they jumped in, around, and 
through the UCSD players, excepting Pete Henderson, 
who led the Tritons with an impressive 12 rebounds to 
dominate the boards . Stan Washington of USD 
number 2? if you went to the game, also pui on quite ~ 
show lead.lng all scorers with 22 points and bringing the 
crowd to Its feet with a dazzling display of behind-the-
back passes and a fine shooting game . 

UCSD once again was led by Paul Trainer who was 
h~ld to one of his lower point totals of the year - 12 
big ones. He was closely followed by Jon LeLevier and 
Gie Simpson, who scored 11 and 10 points respectively . 

Dav~ Moragne also surprised some with his fine play 
coming off the bench to score 9 points. 

The basketball teams were not the only show around 
(especially the UCSD team, who shot only 37% from 
the floor during the game), as there was all added new 
dimension Saturday. This was the introduction of the 

terri~l.y tantalizing sounds from a group of UCSD 
musIcians. Perhaps a more in-depth analysis of the 
aural display should be left to the Arts Department, but 

Jon Lelevier shows why the Tritons had problems 
underneath. 

putting it succinctly, the music was a distinct change 
from the usual basketball collection of sounds. Some 
problems have developed concerning the concentra-
tion of the players during the game, especially during 
the free-throw shooting, that will have to be worked 
out. Some members of the audience also expressed 
their displeasure with the music, especially the ones 
who sat in front of the amplifiers and went home with 
headaches, but it was another step forward on the road 
to intercollegiate sports perfection. Besides the music 
there were also the cheerleaders, who did their by now 
usual fantastic jo b, and, well, what more ca n we say? 

The near-future for the basketball team means this 
we.ekend and they journey up north again, this time to 
Irvine. Fo.rtunatel y, All-Ca l, which is what th ey're going 
up to Irvine for, IS not really All-Cal, wh ich means no 
UCLA or Berkeley, but the opposition lines up badly 
e~ough anyhow. The .team will be playing Thursda y, 
Friday, and Saturday nights against such opponents as 
Santa Cruz, Irvine and Davis. This should keep the 
vars.ity qui.te busy for the weekend and they ' ll be 
having their own brand of fun while the rest of us sit 
around and study. 

The junior varsity deserves a little mention also as 
they successfull~ established their own modest winni ng 
streak . After losing last Tuesday, they put it all together 
fC?r a two game victory spree over the weekend. Friday 
night they took Pacific Christian and in the pre-vars ity 
game festivities Saturday, they took the men from 
Miramar in a hard-fought contest. But we' ll leave room 
for more on that later upon the return of your regular 
reporter. 

Pete Henderson checks in with two.

Bluegrass 
This Friday, JanlJ y 19th, the Campus Programming 

Board will preser:t n evening of bluegrass music in 
Revelle Cafeteria .1t 6:30 P.M. - admission is FREE. The 
featured performHS will be THE COUNTRY GAZETIE 
and KAJSA OHMAN. 

A strong, new contender has entered the bluegrass 
music scene in the form of the west coast based group 
called Country Gazette. In addition to their solid 
background in bluegrass, the four members of the 
band have also garnered experience in rock music, 
adding an interesting flavor to their brand of music. 

Byron Berline, the best-known member of the 
group, first appeared on the national ~cene as the 
featured fiddler on an album by the Dillards called 
"Pickin' and Fiddlin'." A product of the Texas-
Oklahoma fiddle tradition, Byron sharpened the 
elements of bluegrass in his style during a stint with Bill 
Monroe's Bluegrass Boys, and more recently has played 
the West Coast with Doug Dillar's expedition and the 
Flying Burrito Brothers. He also played fiddle on the 
Rolling Stones' "let It Bleed" album. With The Gazette 
he exhibits his versatility by doubling on mandolin, 
which he picks in a strong, smooth style that invites 
comparison with the best in the bluegrass field. 

Banjo player Alan Munde has known Byron since the 
early 60's when both were playing with local bluegrass 
bands in Texas and Oklahoma. Alan's experience with 
such groups as the Stone Mountain Boys and Poor 
Richard's Almanac led to a position with Jimmy Mar-
tin s band. He played both lead electric guitar and 
banjo with the Flying Burrito Brothers before joining 
The Gazette. ' 

Bassist Roger Bush began his career in Bluegrass with 
the Kentucky Colonels, a now "legendary" group 
whose forays in to country rock greatly influenced The 
Byrds, The Burrito Bothers, and Crosby, Stills, Nash and 
Young. When the Band broke up in 1967, Roger left 
music for a time until Byron Berline recruited him for 
the last Burrito Brothers tour. Studio work with Steve 
Stills, Linda Ronstadt, and others kep him occupied 
until the chance to record with Country Gazette 
brought him back to bluegrass. . 

The guitarist of the group is Kenny Wertz, whose hrst 
musical experience was in folk groups with David 
Crosby. He moved on to play bluegrass with the 
Scottsville Squirrel Barkers, which included Chris 
Hillman on mandolin and played with several other 
bands before joining the Burrito Borthers in 1971 . He 
played Banjo on several of the group's bluegrass 
numbers, but the presence of Alan Munde in the 
Gazette leaves Kenny free to concentrate on guitar and 
vocals. 

Kajsa Ohman 
From the state of Montana to the west coast comes 

Kajsa Ohman, a singer and guitarist who provides with 
her own songs a light, pleasing country-western at-
mosphere. She has worked in a bluegrass g~oup b~fore 
and is now setting out on her own. She IS r:naklng a 
return visit to UCSD, having been well-received In a 
previous concert here. 

Ruscha's Books

confused by the sparsity of works exhibited In the large 
room which itself seems to swallow up the art. Ap-pare~tly the artist had an intention in mind by presen-
ting his works as he does with dubiou.s effect. ~ne 
small corner of the room is utilized by suspending 
approximately fifty books from the ceiling to a height 
of around three feet off the floor. This effect tends to 
distract the viewer and make him wonder about the 
exact purpose of this plan. I was tempted to leaf 
through these booklets, but being trained no~ to touch 
exhibited works of art, I felt nervous dOing so. I 
discovered later that these books are intended to be 
opened and viewed. 

On the wall directly opposite to the suspended 
books is a unique display of a manuscript-like book 
opened full-length . This book, entitled "All the 
Buildings On the Sunset Strip", is nothing more than 
photographs of every buildi.ng along. Hollywo~d's 
famous Sunset Strip. Encased In glass directly behind 
this work are the pages of a disassembled book, each 
page uniquely stained with substances such as bl~od 
(Ruscha 's), beer (Coors), coffee (Yuban), urine 
(human), as well as other surprising stains. 

Completing the ·exhibit are lithogr~phs of ~r. 
Ruscha's books, either lying flat or appearing to float In 
the air. 

The artist seems to have discovered a workable 
expression for himself through his art. It is obvious that 
the artist, as well as being ingenious, has a sense of 
humor, and it is my opinion that this exhibit is well 
worth the few minutes it will take the viewer to make 
his own judgments about Edward Ruscha's "Books." 
The Gallery, located in the Humanities-Library 
Building, is open from noon to 5 daily and Wednesday 
evenings from 8 to 10 p.m.
