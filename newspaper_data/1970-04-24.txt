Secret Research 
Works Discussed 

Roger Show ley

"Classified or secret work of any kind is incompatible with the 
educational functions of a university campus . .. We believe it 
inappropriate for the University to engage in secret research using 
facilities ostensibly dedicated to the open dissemination of 
knowledge. " 

This statement of policy, approved by the Academic Senate in 
November 1967, became the center of controversy this week as the 
Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) alleged that UCSD 
professors and administration were supporting war-related research 
by carrying on classified work under the auspices of the University.

Herbert York, Dean of Graduate Studies, and an outspoken critic of 
the Anti-Ballistics Missile system (ABM) countered that "no con-
tracts on campus that involve any work in La Jolla involve classified 
work. No work now at Scripps or the Upper Campus," he said, " is 
regarded as classified, but there is 'such work being carried on at the 
Point Loma NELC." 

But up to 100 academic personnel - including perhaps 50 faculty 
members - he said, are cleared for working with classified material 
by the Department of Defense. York is one of them. 

Alameda County sheriffs march toward confrontation 
at UC Berkeley riots, which took place last weekend. 
students and others were protesting the existence of 

the ROTC on campus, and 22 arrests were made 
the first day. Along with a report on activities at 
UC santa Barbara. see page 2 for details. 

Contract vs. "Arrangements" 
In dealing with the problem of classified work at UCSD, the ad-

ministration, according to Chancellor McGill, must recognize that the 
faculty are free to serve as " consultants" for agencies of the Federal 
government, "much as they are free to publish a book." 

EOP Cutbacks Threaten to 
Decrease Minority Enrollment 

Insofar as the campus supports the faculty's work, he explained, two 
vaults are provided for the " convenience of the faculty :" one is at the 
Campus Police station and the other at Sverdrup Hall at Scripps. 
"Perhaps a dozen or more faculty members are currently utilizing 
this convenience," York e~timated, but indicated that the number 
varies from year to year.

The administration, in April 1969, McGill said, "became aware of 
the existence of classified material in faculty offices. Nine files were 
removed to the Point Lorna station, and to our best knowledge have 
been liquidated." Normally, the Defense Department requires certain 
security measures for the retention of classified documents, York 
said, and the administration currently forbids the faculty from 
allowing such security measures in their offices.

Students Face Discipline 
Over Contracts Incident 

Disciplinary action will be taken next week a-
gainst seven students who refused to leave during 
a disturbance in the Contracts and Grants Office 
Monday. An eighth person is being cited in connec-
tion with the visit of a representative from the Na-
val Electronics Laboratory las t week. 
val Electronics Laboratory Center last week. ' 

Vice-Chancellor & Dean George Murphy said yes-
terday that he has informed the eight that they have 
until today to decide whetlier to appear before him 
in an administrative hearing or the student-Faculty 
Conduct Board next week. He added that two of the 
eight are currently on disciplinary probation resul-
ting fr om their participation in a confrontation with 
a Marine recruiter a year ago. 

At the close of the ecology convocation held at 
noon in the gym, SDS leader Byron King, in an 
impromptu fashion, called upon those in the crowd 
who objected to work done by NELC and UCSD's 
"involvement in war-related research" to march to 
Matthews Campus to protest. No other purpose or 
destination was identified at that time. 

About thirty students and Professor Lettau 
walked down through the administrative complex, 
ignOring the Chancellor's Office, usual place of 
protest, and walked to the Accounting Office. About 
half of the students entered the office and went into 
the Contracts and Grants Office while the others 
remained outside. Student comments indicated that 
they felt they had no leader and no organization. 

The other students surged into the office, went 
directly to the files, and began looking through 
them. Assistant Business Manager Shan Heidt said 
she looked up from her desk and saw two male 
students. She went to help them and saw the whole 
crowd rush in, and went to get Mr. Richard Wein-
berger, Contracts and Grants Officer. They did not 
have a chance to call anyone before Revelle College 
Dean Tom Hull and Executive Dean Lynn Naibert 
came in. Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs George 
Murphy wu called a few momenta later. 

One girl, Mill Heidt said, went through her in-box 
and asked what she did. which Mias Heidt ex-
plained. Mill Heidt said the attitude of the students 

was generally one of rudeness though some tried to 
explain why they were there. She said it was "hard 
to understand" what was happening and that the 
students were like " Castro men ... demonstratmg 
the very thing they are against. " 

Murphy requested that all the protesters leave the 
office and all immediately did, except the seven 
against whom action is pending. 

A file was taken from the office by an unidentified 
person and Murphy said "appropriate disciplinary 
action and criminal prosecution will be initiated as 
soon as his identity is established." 

Murphy has since informed the TRITON TIMES 
that he has sent notices of conduct violation to the 
six students who refused to leave and a seventh 
suspected of taking the notebook containing 
research contracts. He also stated that he has sent 
several letters indicating that he was willing to 
cooperate with the students to resolve the issues 
surrounding the incident. 

The SDS action followed Professor Lettau 's 
speech at Monday's convocation in the gym com-
mencing Earth Week. 

Before Dr. Halpern of the t"ltysics Department 
had time to explain the naiion's impending 
ecological disaster his time expire\! . Dr. Gabriel 
Jackson shifted the topic to the "deplorable 
violence at Santa Barbara: ' stressing that a 
"society cannot compete with violence." Professor 
Lettau then took the lectern and again shifted the 
topic - this time to the war in Viet Nam. 

He criticized the president's war policies with 
satirical and sarcastic comments about attempts to 
ignore " the stench of floating bodies in the Mekong 
River." Lettau's speech ended with a direct appeal 
to the consciences of all Americans. 

The SOS met Tuesday night to discuss further 
plans for opposing defense research on campus. 
Although It was publicized as an open meeting, 
TRITON TIMES News Editor Roger Showley was 
forcibly removed from Blake Hall lounge, so that no

Student Â· Police Battle 
Expands On Two Fronts 

Bill Alaoglu 

"The plain truth is that this is a revolutionary 
process and program that is golng on. The campus 
itself is the target. Is there no one. in view of the 
record. that is going to suggest that we haven't been 
subjected to a blood-bath for these last three or four 
years? " This analysis of the violence that has 
rocked UC Santa Barbara and UC Berkeley this 
weekend by Governor Ronald Reagan continued. " I 
hope this will bring some sober reflections and some 
common sense to the so-called silent majority of 
students faculty and administrators to where they themsel~es will take a stand and say. 'This is the 
end. no more attending rallies. no more even sup-
porting with an expression of sympathy those ~ho 
have resorted to this kind of violence.' Just staylIlg 
out of riots isnÂ·t enough. They must make it plain 
that they have no sympathy for them at all. " 

This statement refers to a much reported com-
ment of the Governor in which he called for an end 
of appeasement with campus radicals, and said, " If 
there 's going to be a bloOdbath, let's have it now." 

The rioting at Santa Barbara followed the pattern 
of the disturbances in February. Windows in 
several real estate offices were broken, cars demol-
ished some fires set. A large crowd, threatening to 
burn down the Bank of America building. a tempor-
ary structure replacing the building destroyed by 
fire in February 's rioting. was confronted at the 
door by students and other members of the com-
munity, trying to stop any P?ssible attack on ~he 
bank building. A member of this group. after haVlng 
put out a fire in the bank, Kevin Patrick Moran. a 
student 22 was fatally wounded after shots were 
fired by Sa~ta Barbara sheriffs. The official report 
explains that the shots were fired to returning 
sniper fire . 

The Santa Barbara Sheriff's Department had 
blamed the fatal shot on an unknown sniper, how-
ever later, a Santa Barbara policeman admitted 
firing his rifle accidently as he leaped .from a 
truck. The officer has been subsequently relieved of 
duty pending an official investigation. 

The County sheriff, James Webster. announced 
he is de~scalating the strong show of force that has 
sealed off Isla Vista and enforced a general curfew 

Sunday and Monday nights. However, the police 
continued heavy patrolling. every five minutes. in a 
Los Angeles TIMES report. and have also used steel 
sided dump trucks. carrying armed peace officers 
to maintain order. 

However. as an uneasy peace returned to the Isla 
Vista Community. the curfew was lifted. but the 
TRITON TIMES has no reports of reduced police 
activity . 

The Berkeley Campus was badly disturbed by 
battles between approximately 3000 students and 
peace officers. The Thursday disturbances came 
following a rally , in which calls were made to take 
action to end the war. The students moved to con .. 
front police in front of the Naval ROTC building. 
Callagan Hall. The students gathered on the lawns 
and in the landscaping before the porch of the 
Wooden Building. Â·that was filled with UC police in 
riot helmets and prepared with tear gas. Rocks and 
bottles and even some paint filled balloons were 
thrown' by students. and the police responded with 
tear gas. The disturbances continued for some time. 
and twenty-two arrests were made the first day. 
Four of those arrested were termed "non-students" 
and members of the "militant Weathermen faction 
of SDS (Students for a Democratic Society)." 

The fighting continued into the weekend. with 
small groups of students and police battling on 
campus and down. Telegraph Avenue. 

Both Regents and administrators have expressed 
alarm at the damage caused at Berkeley. including 
a fire that was set in the Life Sciences Building. 
Windows have been broken in the Chancellor's 
home. actually situated on campus. 

These two major disturbances come within a 
month of passage of rules introduced by the 
Governor to the Regents. designed to "curb UC via- ,. 
lence." These rules empowered the Chancellors to 
give interim suspensions without hearings for 
suspicion of activity in connection with campus 
disturbances. or disturbances within one mile of 
campus. The Los Angeles TIMES reports that UC 
President Hitch explained that the rules had little 
effect on the reaction of the administration because 
they had adequate powers before the rules were 
passed.

BANK OF AMERICA HEAD DEPLORES WAR 
The head of the world's largest bank has called the Viet Nam 

war a tragic mistalle that has distorted the US economy and 
damaged domestic business enterprises. 

Testifying at a session of the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee hearings on the imact oj the war on the national 
economy, Louis Lundborg, chairman of the board of Bank of 
America, said that an end to the war would be "good, not bad, 
for American business." 

After citing inflationary pressures and raised taxes, Lund-
borg went on to say, "If anyone is to blame (for the war) it is 
people like me Jor not spealling up sooner - for not aslling 
'What goes on here?' 

"Because I have had no good reason to doubt the good faith 
oj the withdrawal plans announced by the President, I might 
have continued to remain silent. But when I read twelve days 
ago that the President is under pressure to expand our 
military role in Asia, it seemed to me the time had come to 
speak up and speak out and to say, 'Our meddling has gone Jar 
enough.' .. 

AGNEW ATTACKS MICH. U. ON 10% BLACK QUOTA 
Spiro T. has attacked the University of Michigan on their 

recent agreement to a 10 per cent quota for .blacll students by 
1970. He has charged the university president, Robben 
Fleming, with "surrender" to black militants, calling the 
agreement a "callow retreat from reality. ': " 

In a publicly released statement, Fleming stated,. The 
Vice-President is badly misinformed about the commitment 
the university's regents, faculty and administration have 
made to provide educational opportunity to disadvantaged 
young people, particularly blacks. 

"We intend to provide' reasonable assurance of a successful 
educational experience for these students. What we have 
undertaken is not an impossibility but an opportunity to serve 
the American promise." 

Attacking the idea oj minority quotas, Spir? T. said he do~s 
"not accept the proposition that every A mencan boy and girl 
should go to a four-year college." 
HITLER 'S BEST-SELLER AVAILABLE AGAIN 

As a public service, the Hutchinson publishing firm of 
England has decided to bring out a new edition of Hitler's 
" Mein Kampf." Because no publisher has up to now wanted 
the book on his list, "Mein Kampf" has not been printed since 
World War II, and copies were almost unobtainable. Hut-
chinson has gone ahead with its plans for publication, despite 
the Bavarian Government's attempts to stop any renewed 
interest in their blackest sheep. The new volume, mainly in-
teded Jor libraries and scholars, is now in its third printing. 
since its release in October.

Owen Joyner 
StaHWrlter 

tJCSD students will decide 
whether or not to accept the new 
proposed AS Constitution in a 
special general referendum to be 
held this coming Tuesday and 
Wednesday. 

The major body change in this 
new charter. finalized at the 
constitutional convention last 
Wednesday. is to replace the 
present system of college 
senators with a set of six com-
missioners elected to serve 
specific AS functions. If this 
constitution is approved next 
week by the students then the AS 
will proceed to hold elections for 
the commissioners the. following 
week. If the consitituion is 
rejected then the election will be 
for senators under the present 
system. In either case the offices 
of president and vice-president 
will be at large also. 

The new constitituion provides 
for a council of nine voting 
members - the six om-
missioners. and one represen-
tative from each of the three 
colleges. appointed by the in-
dividual college councils.

Urey Hall BOMB Scare 
Jason Cathcart 

Staff Writer 
The chancellor's office received an anonymous phone call Wed-

nesday Apri122, at 12: 45 p.m. declaring that Urey Hall was doomed by 
explosion at 1:30 p.m. According to Chancellor McGill the voice in-
sisted "I am not kidding. " A bomb failed to explode. 

After having received the phone call. the chancellor's office notified 
personnel in Urey Hall and pOlice then insisted on an immediate 
evacuation. Campus firemen and police combed the seven floor 
building which houses computers. classrooms and offices of numerous 
science departments. 

For an hour a crowd gathered outside awaiting the outcome. A small 
harmless black box was found and occupancy was resumed about 2 
p.m . 

Se'niors Seek Valedictorian 
As Graduation Approaches 

Chris Bibb 
Staff Writer 

The Senior class, meeting Â·last week. laid out 
plans for Commencement and sought students 
interested in addressing the graduates in June. 
"Past commencements have included an un-
dergraduate as well as a graduate student on the 
program. and the speaker doesn't have to be at the 
top of the class." said Roger Showley. an Associated 
Students representative to the Public Ceremonies 
Cormnittee, responsible for planning the event. 

Commencement will take place at 1 p.m. Sunday, 
June 14. Showley. a Muir senior. and Revelle senior 
Cindy .Neilsen told the CommitteeÂ·s plans for the 
graduation of the third class to start at UCSD. 

It was decided at the meeting that any graduating 
senior may apply or nominate a senior for the 
speaker's position at the Associated Students Office 
in 250 MC. A brief ouUine of the subject is requested 
of applicants. Nielsen also asked for volunteers to 
plan a senior party to contact the AS Office. 

Guest speaker on June 14 will be architect R. 
Buckminster Fuller. famous for the design of the 
Chrysler Airstream and the 1967 Montreal geodesic 

dome. Fuller is noted for his emphasis on fitting 
technology to the needs of society. 

Before Commencement. breakfasts have been 
planned for seniors at Revelle and Muir Commons. 

Nielsen asked for suggestions for a senior gift, 
and recalled that the class of '69's anchor never 
materialized and that '68's rock split into three 
pieces. It was decided that the class of '70 would 
leave behind a bit of levity in the form of a swing. 

Black caps and gowns have been arranged at no 
cost to seniors. A representative was in the 
bookstore yesterday to take measurements. Revelle 
and Muir seniors will receive them during finals 
week, along with blue Revelle tassels and green 
Muir tassels. Also available at the bookstore are 
graduation announcements. 

Showley emphasized that "any senior who 
graduates in the Winter. Spring or Fall Quarters, 
1970. is eligible to participate in the ceremony." A 
list of Spring Quarter graduates will be posted at the 
Revelle College Provost office and will be available 
at Muir Provost office on May 1. Seniors should 
check for their names, since they must be on this list 
to receive a diploma in June.

program of study in ecology and the 
environment. The committee, 
composed of Drs. Doolittle (chair-
man), Goldberg, Gusfield, Schneider , 
and Soule, was appointed by the 
Academic Senate to study the 
problem of a degree in that field. 

The committee was created when 
Dr . Stanford Penner brought a 
proposal to the Academic Senate for a 
" Doctorate in Engineering Science , 
later revised in the form 01 a Doc-
torate of Environmental Science. II 
The committee belie ves its purpose is 
" in essence, to gather information 

(Iacts and opinions) as to whether a 
higher degree program in En -
vironmental Science is (a) desirable 
(b) wanted (c) needed and/ or (d) 
warranted. " 

CONSERVATION SPEAKER 

"We can. and must, work within 
'the system' to save out en-
vironment. II conservation lobbyist 
John Zierold told 150 students on 
Revelle Plaza Tuesday, pleading for 
state legislati ve action. 

Zierold. Sacramento representative 
lor the Planning and Conservation 
League, selected two bills now before 
the legislature for special attention. 
First , a bill to set up a 10 million 
dollar program of conservation 
edltcation starting in the lirst grade. 

Zierold suggested that 5 million be 
taken from the driver education 
program to help fund it. " We must 
aslt the governor whether he thinks 
state money should be spent to train 
new operators of the worst polluter of 
them all : the automobile." Second, a 
bill to require cities and counties to 

"Sometimes 1 have to wake up and 
listen for the sea, II said Jeffers. It's 
not only the sea which one has to tune-
in to, Harry went on to say, but also 
the soils. shrubs, and the winds. 

The nature walk was not an over-
bearing trip 01 taxonomy, for ''It's 'not 
the names of things which are im-
portant, it's the experience of being 
with them , II spoke the guiding ranger. 

Torrey Pines is an 877 acre park 
with 3,000 unique trees balanced on 
the cliffs between La Jolla and Del 

Ma r. Another 1500 tree. are on a hili 
to the east, balanced between an issue 
of housing and remaining part 01 the 
park. Three tho .. ,;und more dollars is 
the fulcrum of the balance ; the 
decision will be made June 1.

WILDLIFE 

"Animals can live without man, but 
can man live without animals?" 
Naturalist Bob Gray posed this 

question Wednesday In his talk on the 
state of wildliJe in our en vironment. 

"Eighteen animals are on the verge 
of extinction, " he warned, "and if you 
look for a cause, you will lind it has to 
be man. There are 1,000 animals on 
the 'red list.' as well, which Is com-
piled by the International Center for 
the Preservation oJ Nature to signal 
threats to the existence of animals. 

" ... We can learn a great deal 
from wild animals if we are willing to 
sacrifice some of our arrogance as 
human beings. II Gray suggested that 
western man's Judaeo-Christian 
orientation has elevated him to self-
Imposed domination over all 
creatures oJ the (!arth. But now we 
must rea lite that we can't do 
everything - because we are 
animals." 

He noted that 10,000 years ago man 
had to adopt his superior attitude 
when he was at the mercy oJ his en-
vironment. But now when he has the 
mastery oJ technology, he has to 
realize that it is capable oJ killing 
himself. 

Gray pointed out the advantages oJ 
preserving animal populations, aside 
Irom the value they serve as sources 
of food and clothing. Studies of 
overcrowding, lor example, con be 
based on the reactions of animals. So 
Jar, he said, "the higher vertebrates 
tend to go crazy.

Heal'h food Consumers 
Ta'e Heed or Drop Dead 

Once-untouchable institutions in American life, the hamburger and 
the pizza are now falling apart as quickly as the Supreme Court, the 
haircut, and Donald Duck. Witness, here today, the advent of the 
health-conscious eater. Now ev!!rybody is catching on that Wonder (if 
it is) Bread helps ruin your body in 12 different ways because it is 
made from bleached, white flour, and contains 137 chemical preser-
vatives (including chromium pyoethylorbate, known to produce 
leprosy on the skin of, iguanas). 

What we have going on here in the resurgence of health food-
consciousness is not merely just another everyday upheaval of the 
American life style, but possible something slightly more important, 
because in dealing with food we're really getting down to the basics. 

Thus if you have decided to eat health foods, either because you feel 
they will make you healthier, or because your friends are doing it, it is 
important to understand what the rationale is behind eating them, and 
to what extent they can be valuable. 

Certainly everybody will concede at least the three'<luarter truth of 
"You are what you eat," " Man is as he eats," and other similar 
adages which your grandmother should know. Also, what is pretty 
obvious is the necessity of certain nutrients, such as proteins and 
minerals, to sustain the human body. The particular requirements of 
these nutrients for a certain individual are very much contingent upon 
such factors as sex, age,size, degree of activity, metabolism rate, and 
climate. Your requirements can be fOWid in tables in any nutrition 
book, almanac, encyclopedia, dictionary,etc. The next step is to 
ascertain whether or not you are obtaining these necessary sub-
stances. Again some kind of reference material may be used to 
detennine the nutritional value of the foods you eat. Be careful though, 
as this can be one road to fanaticism. There are many super-consclous 
eaters who meticulously compute their nutrients . You might feel life is 
too short to waste a lot of time on such a silly pastime. To obtain a 
qualitative knowledge of the nutritional value offoods is sufficient. 
Vegetables Only? 

Often the big decision confronting the potential health food eater is 
whether or not to go vegetarian. While It is true that there are several 
non-meat sources rich in protein, most notably soybeans, the whole 
question comes down to how strong your grudge is against meat. You 
might also consider how radical a health food eater you want to 
become and how much time you want to spend learning how to 
prepare soybeans 400 different ways so you won't get sick of them. 
Connected with this question are several lesser ones, namely whether 
to eat eggs or cheeses, which are not exactly meat, and, if you do 
decide to eat meat, whether to draw the line at fish, or white meats 
(chicken), or red meats (beef). 

The case against meat, in particular beef, ranges from some pretty 
sound medical argwnents to some other religious and rather absurd 
superstitious ones. The most weighty of the medical arguments is the 
presence of cholesterol in meat, which is responsible for fatty acid 
buildups around the heart, causing cardiovascular disorders. 
However, proper exercise helps the body to burn off this excess 
cholesterol. 

The rewards of eating healthy natural foods cannot be belittled. 
They can certainly be responsible for many ameliorative changes in 
an individual's personality, behavior, well-being, and physical ap-
pearance. Eating properly can help bring about a cheerful and 
easygoing demeanor, a body free from tension and sluggishness a 
clear and crisp mind, and a generally glOwing physical prese~ce 
which exudes health. 
Other Factors Too 

However, good health (presumably what the health food eater is 
striving for) Is inextricably tied up with other factors beside good 
nutrition. Proper rest, exercise, fresh clean air, proper breathing, and 
the absence of emotional strains are among them. If a person ran-
sacks the local health foods store every day and stiD feels crummy, the 
fact that he smokes four packs of cigarettes a day, or still shoots 
speed, could have something to do with it. 

Probably the most important thing to keep in mind when dealing 
with health foods is to be leaalble. There is a tendency among people 
who begin to indulge in things Uke drugs, alcohol, or sex, to carry their

A Prison Without Bars 11 
SAN FRANCISCO - (CPS) - Alcatraz Island 

has never been the kind of place people flock to for 
any reason - at least not voluntarily. Long before 
1933 when the United States Department of Justice 
converted it into a maximum security prison, the 
"Rock," as it is affectionately known, was a 
Spanish fortress as well as a depository (or un-
desirables. 

With the arrival of the Civil War, the United Staes 
Government felt compelled to take advantage of the 
cave dungeons which the Spaniards had generously 
bequeathed. Uncle Sam found the Rock an ideal 
location for military prisoners. When the war en-
ded, the military decided to hang on to the island 
since it was felt that it would be a smashing home V~r deviant soldiers who were serving sentences 
_hich generally exceeded their life expectancies. 

When the Justice Department decided to 
disestablish the federal prison - a humanitarian 
gesture encouraged, no doubt, by the fact that it 
cost a bundle to operate - everyone seemed to 
think it was a good idea. From March 21, 1963, when 
the last prisoners left the rock, the island was 
nol'ling more than an infamous reminder of what 
used to be - that is, before the Indians landed. 

The occupation of Alcatraz, which began on 
November 20, 1969 when about 200 Indians landed, 
marked a reversal of tactics. Since Europeans 
began colonizing what is today the United States, 
Indian tribes throughout the country were forced off 
their lands, tens of thousands were slaughtered, and 
countless others were treated brutally or left to 
starve. 

As sociologists George Simpson and Milton 
Yinger have noted, "As colonists became more 
numerous and began to press deeper into the In-
dians' lands, sharp conflicts inevitably arose. Few 
of the settlers seriously considered that the Indians 
might have some rights to the land. It was easier to 
develop a picture of the lying, thieving, murdering 
savage, pagan in religion, racially stupid except for 
a kind of animal cunning. Such a person has no 
rights; the only good Indian is a dead Indian ." 

Though this view was that of the farmer-settler 
and was the view which prevailed, it was often very 
different from the opinion of others who moved 
individually among the Indians. Simpson and 
Yinger explain that while there were 
" ... qualifications and exceptions and ambivalent 
feelings, they were never enough to prevent the 
continuing seizure of Indian lands with a minimum 
of compensation, the decimation of the Indian 
population to scarcely more than one-third its 
original size, and the developing of a rationalizing 
prejudice that moved with the white man across the 
continent." The land-grab, for so long a tactic of the 
white man, has now been used on behalf. of the In-
dian . 

Richard Oakes, leader of the Indians, is the 
chairman of the Student Council of American 
Natives at San Francisco State College. A 
descendent of the Eastern Mohawks, Oakes gave up 
a $300 a week construction job in Rhode Island to go 
to San Francisco State. Since November 20, Oakes 
has lived on Alcatraz with his wife and five children 
and representatives of numerous tribes from 
thr()Ill!'tlOut the COUllltT'Y. 

,-.' ;::: 
Quite simply, the Indians wish to establish :'.::: 

Alcatraz as a cultural center where Indians would ::: 
come from all over the countrY to learn in an at- ::: 
mosphere " . .. of mutual interest and autonomy." :;: 
What's more, according to a treaty concluded .:::. 
between the Sioux and the United States Govern- ::: 
ment (April 29, 1868), the Indians may receive land ::: 
which has been abandoned by the government. ::: 

During the first several days of the occupation, r 
the Coast Guard imposed a blockade and stopped :.'. ::':: 
shipments of food and supplies from reaching the 
island. Milk for a sick baby wasn't even allowed to ::: 
pass, although some goods were brought back by ::~ :::.:.::.: blockade runners at night. When the blockade was 
lifted and normal shipments reswned, the General 
Services Administration, landiord of the Rock, said :-: 
it was considering giving the Indians 12 acres m 
elsewhere if they would leave Alcatraz. Speaking ........ :: 
for the Indians, Oakes said the Indians were 
claiming Alcatraz as a "down payment" for money ::: 
which the government owes Indians for their lands, ::: 
but that they would accept any additional land the .:::':;::.: 
government wants to give them. 

The most damaging effect of the intrusion of the .:. 
dominant white society was that it destroyed, or ::: 
attempted to destroy, the Indian 's culture. The ~:.:~ 
disorganizing influence of the reservation policies ::: 
to which the Indians were subjected is described in ::: 
an excerpt from Gordon MacGregor's book '.' 
"Warriors Without Weapons." MacGregor states ::: 
that the policy toward Indians was " ... to civilize ~~ ~ 
to humanize (sic ), and to put the children in ::: 
boarding schools where they would learn English ::: 
and not relapse into their former moral and mental ::: 
stupor t U and educational policy described it. ~:~ 

The federal director of Indian schools made a::: 
statement in 1885 which is critically important as an ::: 
indication of what the government was seeking to do ::: 
with the Indians. He stated, "The Indian is the .~~.~ 
strangest compound of individualism and socialism 
run to seed. It is this being that we endeavor to :~: 
make a member of a new social order ... To do this ::: 
we must recreate him, make him a new per- ::: 
sonality. " ::: 

As MacGregor continuell , "Children were vir- ::: 
tually kidnapped to force them into government ::: 
schools , their hair was cut, and their Indian clothes ::: 
thrown away . They were forbidden to speak in their ::: 
own language. Life in the school was under military ::: 
discipline , and the rules were enforced by corporal ::; 
punishment. Those who persisted in clinging to their ::: 
old ways and those who ran away and were ::: 
recaptured were thrown into jail. Parents who ::: 
objected were also jailed. Where possible, children ::: 
were kept in school year after year to avoid the ::: 
influence of their families ." ::: 

Although there have been a few exceptions, the ::: 
invading white society took the Indians ' lands and ::: 
disrupted or destroyed their way of life . The pattern ::: 
of disorganization begun so long ago is still evident ::: 
today in Indian crime rates, in widespread idleness, ::: 
and in the high rate of drunkeness . The reservations ::: 
cannot support the number of Indian residents . ::: 
Unemployment rates of 75 per cent are not unusual, ::: 
and the per capita annual income is so far below the ::: 
poverty line that the l'ldians constitute the poorest ::: 
minority in the nation. ~~ ~

II ITttltlALI 
How to Maie AS fffective 

Student governments have traditionally been seen as 
a farce by most students. Powerless in relation to the 
administration and serving largely as an ego-trip for 
those involved, these governments are usually , poor 
examples of participatory democracy. 

On this campus several people have worked hard to 
make the AS viable and powerful, but have found 
recently that structural inadequacies are rapidly 
leading the AS down the road of most other student 
governments. 

There are two general problems with the current 
structure. First of all , the AS is a campus-wide body 
within a university thaÂ·t is organized on a college basis. 
While certain activities will always be handled on an AS 
level, delegation and especially communication with the 
fledgling college governments has to be increased. This 
will, of course, take a joint effort and understanding 
between the AS and the colleges. 

Secondly, AS senators, elected in such a manner as to 
. ensure representation of varied viewpoints on a 
supreme legislative body, have little if any specific 
duties, and have traditonally done little more than oc-
casionally play politics. Meanwhile, the AS executive 
officers- president and vice-president, as well as ap-
pointed commissioners with specific duties, have been 
the real workers. 

The proposed constitutional revisions move in the 
direction of correcting these inadequacies. Representa -
tives chosen by the college governments, as well as 
elected and appointed comm issioners are provided for. 

There are many things yet to be worked out. 
Basically, a more explicit defin i tion of the duties and 
responsibilities of members of the AS Council is needed. 
They must insure that we do not lapse into a situation in 
which the Council as an entity is widely representative, 
but individual commissions are not. 

A final draft of the constitution is being prepared by 
the Associated Students and will be published in Tues-
day's edition of the TRITON TIMES. This final draft will 
hopefully take into consideration the best of the 
suggestions offered at Wednesday's Constitutional 
Convention . 

Student government can only be effective if its struc -
ture is such that it can be responsive to the needs it is 
supposed to serve. The Associated Students should be 
supported in their attempt to implement this. 

Who ;s Conspiring? 
'SOS has raised the issue of defense contracts at 

UCSO, and it is essentially a valid issue. We feel that it is 
not appropriate for the university to be involved in any-
thing that is necessary to conceal from the university 
community . Conspiracies are not within the framework 
of an institution that proclaims itself to be based on free 
and open inquiry. 

But neither is the type of conspiracy that S OS has 
resorted to this past week within this framework. 
Beyond that, their actions tend to be damag ing to the 
very ca use they seek to support, 

The incident we are referring to occured after Mon-
day's ecology rally when SOS asked students who 
supported their fight against war research to join them 
in taking action . They then proceeded to the Accounting 
Office, and, after a confrontation, confiscated one of the 
files there. 

The information, since distributed campus-wide in a 
leaflet, turned out NOT to be classified. In fact, Vice-
Chancellor Murphy has since indicated that he will 
make the information in the files available to them in 
the near future. 

Now, ~ i OS would claim, and perhaps legitimately, that 
such action on the part of Murphy would not have been 
forthcomirg had they not had the demonstration . How-
ever, in the absence of a well -documented proof to the 
commur.ity that they had exhausted means to gain such 
information through normal channels, their actions 
became premature l!no intolerable. 

If any really classified information ~xjsts on campus, 
Monday 's activities did little to expose it. . 

SOS rr ust realize that the campus community is going 
to act a jversely to such tactics, regardless of whether 
their ends are justified or not. What will result from 
their actions is not the intellectual discussion of war 
research that should occur, but a reaction to the mean s 
used by them. 

If SOS wishes to have the support of the campus, it 
must realize that it cannot act the role of a self-
appointed vigilance group. In an attempt to prove the 
moral ity of their ends, they cannot use tactics that are a 
contradiction to those ends . At least, they cannot do so if 
they expect the support of the campus.

Subverting Government Contracts 
Dr. M. Srangsr Morgan 

APIS OspartmIJnt 
In his article "Block NEL, Cripple Military" in the April 

10 issue of the TRITON TIMES, Byron King writes that 
NEL " ... has done work on infrared aerial photography 
(used in Vietnam, Thailand, and South America), at-
mospheric reconnaissance devices (no doubt used on the 
SR-71 and U-2 spy plailes now flown over North Vietnam 
and southern China), radar techniques for off-shore small 
boat detection, and guidance devices for surface-to-
surface and surface-to-air missiles. Clearly NEL's only 
function is to make America's military machine operate 
more efficiently - to more efficiently kill Third World 
peasants while protecting U.S. economic interests." 

Several paragraphs later in his article Mr. King notes 
that "over half of UCSD's funds come from federal 
agencies, via: AEC, NASA, Navy, Air Force, CIA, and the 
National Science Foundation." 

Mr. King is correct in his obvious concern over the 
relationship between the research structure in our 
country and the military organization. He is correct too, I 
believe, in suggesting that many academic and other 
researchers do not worry much about the military and 
other social implications of the work they are doing. 

But before setting out to attack and solve a problem, it is 
important to understand it properly. I would like to ex-
pand on two aspects of Mr. King 's letter: 1) his conclusion 
that "clearly NEL's only function is ... to more ef-
ficiently kill Third World peasants while protecting U.S. 
economic interests" and 2) his lwnping of military and 
CIA research support with support from NASA and NSF. 
I'd like to consider this latter point first. 

Up until roughly the last decade if you were a research 
scientist, let's be specific and say an ionospheric 
physicist, you had very few non-military sources to which 
you could turn for support for your work. Perhaps you 

were interested in studying the interaction between 
precipitating auroral particles and the polar ionosphere, 
quite a legitimate basic research problem. In order to get 
yourself funded you wrote a proposal which talked about 
radio communication black outs under auroral conditions 
to make it sound like there were military communication 
applications to your work. Typically the researcher cared 
very little about this aspect of the work and ignored it as 
soon as he got his money. 

Of course ther~ were many people "building better 
bombs," but the point is that there were also large 
numbers of scientists who were subverting the system to 
use military money for basic research activities . These 
scientists existed not just outside of the military, but also 
within the military research labs such as NEL and the Air 
Force Cambride Research Labs. Indeed, the military and 
Congress knew that much of the military research money 
did not go for military research. They continued to sup-
port the arrangement largely because it was the most 
expedient way of funding basic research. 

Many of the scientists working under this arrangement 
were sensitive alert people who understood the im-

, plication of the arrangement and objected to selling their 
soul to the military, even if it was only a partial sale in the 
sense of choosing their words with care when they wrote a 
proposal for basic research. 

With the advent of the NSF and NASA which are civilian 
agencies which fund only non-military research activities, 
many of these concerned scientists heaved a collective 
sigh of relief and began transferring their research 
proposals away from the military. Very recently, there 
has also been an active move on the part of the military to 
get rid of its non-military research functions . This has not 
been that simple, given the serious budgetary restrictions 
that have effected the NSF, NASA, ESSA, and other 
civilian agencies in the last couple of years, and the result 
is that there is still a significant amount of non-military 
research being done with military money, even within the 
military researcb labs. 

This brings us back to my first point. It is just not true 
that NEL's only function is to make America 's military 
machine operate more efficiently - to more efficiently 
kill Third World peasants while protecting U.S. economic 
interests." In the field of ionospheric physics that we took 
as an example earlier, there is a large group at NEL 
which for years has been studying naturally occurring 
traveling disturbances in tbe F-region of the earth 's 
ionosphere. Surely this work has been represented to the 
Navy as having military overtones .. . but the work looks 
much like similar civilian work and most of the major 
contribution of the work has been to non-military basic 
studies of the earth's neutral atmosphere. Undoubtedly 
this work is also misrepresented as having military ap-
plications. But it will probably have its most significant 
impact on the study of clear air turbulence which disrupts 
domestic air transportation and the atmospheric con-
ditions which contribute to air pollution. Very similar 
work is underway at a nwnber of non-military labs. 
Probably this work should not be done in a military lab. 
But itis ... and it doesn 't kill Third World peasants. 

Then too, there is the fact that just as the results of 
civilian research such as basic plasma turbulence studies 
can be used for military applications such as ABM work, 
so too infrared aerial photography is used to help Latin 
American agricultural development; atmospheric 
reconnaissance devices on U2's and SR71 's help enforce 
the test ban treaty ; radar techniques for off-shore small 
boat detection, guidance techniques for surface-ta-surface 
and surface-to-air missiles, and switched beam array 
techniques are being applied to domestic air traffic 
control. 

None of this has been to say that you should not object to 
military research. If we are to survive as a nation and a 
world, de-militarization is mandatory. All I have tried to 
indicate is that we do not have the simple good guys vs. 
bad guys problem that Mr. King sketches ... and com-
plelt problems rarely lend themselves to simplistic 
solutions.

IMusic ... instead of harsh

wide variety of modern works. One trilogy compo of poems y 
E. E. Cummings set to music was especially through-provoking, yet 
an unfortunate incident prevented its completion. It seems that our 
"free speech" plaza is not respected. The performance was in-
terrupted in a manner that shocked and embarrassed many of us in 
the audience. One man, a newcomer to the audience who apparently 
did not take the time to understand what the girls were singing for or 
about, stepped up before the group and confronted the perfonne~s 
with unjustified statements and accusations of, "How can you do this 
when one of your fellow students was killed? Why aren't you doing 
something about it? How can you keep singing when people are being 
killed at your school! ! ?" 

The outburst vibrated with abhorrence in the short silence following. 
The director, Dr. Dorothy Westra, attempted to control the situation. 
These forty girls, all of whom live in Isla Vista, were quite concerned 
and grieved at the death of a man many of them knew personally . 
They left their campus filled with trepidation, were performing in 
unfamiliar atmospheres (UCSD, UCR ) and were very apprehensive 
about their trip home and the situation they would be returning to. 
When the concert was continued the audience was supportive but the 
choir could not continue singing. They were affected too deeply by the 
shockingly misdirected insinuations. Their departure was definitely 
an unhappy one. 

Our protest is against the unappreciative actions of this one out-
spoken man. Were these girls unfeeling and apathetic? Hardly! As one 
very disturbed choir member explained, they were distraught, at-
tempting to be constructive in their efforts, utilizing their talents as a 
confluence between campuses. They were attempting to reflect a 
feeling of unity instead of destruction. Music, universally understood, 
was their communication medium, instead of harsh words and harass-
ments. Perhaps it was the peaceful aestheticism of song that disturbed 
the man. 

UCSO students are all vulnerable to impressions made by indio 
viduals. We are concerned with the effects of continued acts of dis-
respect for others' expression on our campus. It was not merely the 
content of this man's vocalization, but the rude presentation that was 
so disturbing. Lately it seems that these forms of disruptive action are 
becoming more frequent at UCSO's group meetings, as in Monday's 
ecology convocation. The comparatively quiet majority is Dot 
apathetic. It is tired of making amends for those "people" who shoot 
off their mouths with regard only to the achievement of their own ends 
and not to the undesirable consequences for others.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

Schwarz Grateful 
Editor : 

May I congratulate you on the 
balanced and objective 
presentation of news and com-
mentary concerning my par-
ticipation in the program 
"Conservative and Traditional 
Views on Contemporary Issues." 

Could you send me five copies 
of your edition of April lOth? 

Yours very sincerely,

Crusade 

for Appeasement 
Editor : 

The most important rule in 
dealing with dissident groups in 
America today , as every con-
servative (a nd "moderate") 
knows, is not to appease them. 
This was learned at the start of 
World War II when Hitler in-
vaded Czechoslavakia, then 
Poland, after promising to be 
content with only western 
Czechoslavakia. 

The way this rule is applied is 
that whenever someone petitions 
for redress of a grievance and 
creates a demonstration to un-
derscore his point, nothing must 
be done about his petition, lest he 
be encouraged to seek redress of 
another grievance. 

The validity of this rule is 
prove<! by the blacks' demands 
for civil rights. First, all they 
wanted was the vote, then, in-
tegrated schools, then integrated 
housing, then ' equal 
juatlce .. . the next thing you 
know they'll want to marry Our 
daughters . 

After studying this argument I 
carefully, I Considered the fact 
that demonatratlona seem to be 
getting more and more militant 

these days. I decided to look up 
"appease" in my Webster's: "1. 

To pacify, often by satisfying; 
quiet; calm; soothe; allay. 2. To 
conciliate by political, economic, 
or other considerations - now 
usually signifying a sacrifice of 
moral principles in order to avert 
aggression, as an attempt to 
'appease ' the Nazi rulers at 
Munich in 1938." 

I decided that Hitler should . 
have been appeased, although by 
a slightly different definition; Â·be 
should have been calmed and 
soothed in a mental institution. (I 
do not intend to discuss how this 
could have been done; that is not 
the point). 

I also concluded that if ap-
peasement of aggrieved people is 
Â·forbidden, no wonder demon-
strations are getting so militant. 
You figure it out ! 

In closing, a word for you 
radicals listening in: Appease a 

conservative today. Do it in a 
nice, beautiful way.

I want to say publicly that I am 
very 'grateful to Campus Studies 
for sending me their materials. 
It's nice to Imow what some of the 
radicals are up to. It is also in-
teresting to Imow that some of the 
big corporations are doing 
something to help situations in 
this country. Nobody is saying 
that this country is perfect, there 
is plenty of improvement needed. 
But I do Dot think the best way to 
do this is through revolution and 
a communist-oriented society. I 
wonder about some people who

Ecology RIIetoric 
Editor : 

I do not presume to be an 
ecologist, nor do I pretend to have 
a deep understanding of our 
environmental crisis. Similarly, I 
do not have at my command the 
ready-made solutions for such 
problems. I am aware, however, 
that even feeble action will 
produce better results than will 
mere rhetoric. And rhetoric is 
about all we have had. 

Our campus maintains a 
number of disjointed en-
vironmental study groups which 
seek to "educate " the ignorant 
masses. Well and good. But if 
that is all that is done, what is 
accomplished? The verbal 
volleys thrown at the GM 
recruiter were entertaining, but 
they did nothing to reduce smog. 
And the- burying of a car at 
another campus was newswor-
thy, but nothing else came of it. 

Study groups are nice, but we 
more urgently need en-
vironmental task forces . I trust 
that the activities planned for 
"Earth Week" will culminate In 
effective action rather than more 
ineffective words. 

I, too, would like to clean up the 
air, sea, and land; but I hesitate 
to join organizations which only 
pollute the atmosphere with 
s108ans.

for Recruitment 
Editor: 

Once more the issue of job 
recruitment on campus is at 
hand. And once more SDS 
proposes to "protect" any UCSD 
student who might wish to see 
certain recruiters. 

The principal distortion tn 
Byron King 's column of last week 
is the implication that the ad-
ministration is responsible for 
military recruiters 'being on 
campus. It is a painful memory 
for SOS to think back to April of 
1969 when' a student referendum 
was held on recruibnent. This 
referendum was held shortly 
after SOS had blocked a Marine 
recruiter from ent.?ring the 
student employment office. In the 
referendum, the students 
rejected SOS broWTl-shirt tactics 

by approving (with a 61 per cent 
majority ) the "open recruit-
ment" policy. "Open recruit-
ment" means that all potential 
employers of UCSD students are 
acconunodated on campus. 

Byron's other point was NEL's 
contribution to the war in Viet-
nam. One could make the case 
that the side which has 40,000 or 
more troops in every country in 
Indo-China is to blame (North 
Vie7lam). Or the side which 
slaughtered 3,OOO.dvilians at Hue 
in J.llIuary 1968, and showed no 
repe.1tance for this act could be 
blamed (Viet Cong ) . 

1'h" p"!..n io h â¢ l~ ents 
have enough respect {or each 
other to allow each student to 
trust his own consciwce on 
Vietnam, and then to make hi 
own decision on what j b he will

films Â·!criticism pse 0' a Good 1IIea; a fable in Two Acts 
:.:~ If the local area, La JoUa, Del Mar, Pacific Beach, and the university community have better 

things to do with their money than to support the 
symphony, fine, but let's not hear any moaning 

~hen the symphony folds. This group of people, the 
f1rst to cry "public apathy," must realize that at-
tendance at symphony concerts at regular prices 
does not nearly cover the costs. People who attend 

~ s~phony, and are in a position to aid it 
fmancially, should not shirk this responsibility. 
There are many, many people in La Jolla who fit 
this mold. As to the campus community there must 
be individuals who can afford to spend $25. I was 
told that the chancellor offered to purchase a pair .of 
tickets, but that his was the only offer. Where were 
the provosts, the other top administrators the 
people in the Medical School and Scripps? ' 

' 'j .. for AI __ " c.tin181 
Once upon a time th6re were some students at 

UCSD who thought thlt it would be a nice idea if 
they had a concert on c.3mpus to raise money for the 
troubled San Diego S},mphony. They thought that 
not only would the symphony benefit financially 
but also that the students would benefit culturally: 

Dave Sacherman "Anne is really a companion 
piece to "A Man for All Seaaona " 
both pictures dealing with the 
events that led Henry to make 
himself head of the Church of 
England (though here we see Sir 
Thomas More only infrequently). 
Though Anderson's play has been 
opened up considerably to take 
advantage of exterior locations 
such as the English countryside 
with its stately manor homes, the 
heart of the film is still a sort of 
epic battle of the sexes. 

Soon other people became enthused and the idea 
started to become a reality . The symphony was 
contacted, financial aid was obtained from various 
campus groups, ~nd the administrative planning 
begun. It was dec1ded that the most efficient way to 
~o about raising funds would be to sell special 
tickets at $25 a pair . These tickets were to be offered 
to members of the university staff and residents in 
the surrounding communities. Tickets would also be 
available at $.1 for students, $1.50 for staff, and $2 for 
general pubhc. The $25 tickets were to include a 
reception and mention in a special program and 
were tax deductible. It was thought that with a' little 
luck the event could raise six to eight thousand 

Lastly, and most important, where were the 
students? It was not as if the tickets were over-
priced, almost all of us blow a dollar sometime 
during the week without missing it. It was simply 
the fact that nobody gave a damn. 

"Anne of the Thousand Days " 
which recently opened at the 
Cinerama Theatre, is another 
masterful British history lesson 
in the tradition of "Becket" and 
"Lion in Winter." Adapted from 
Maxwell Anderson's play 
"Anne" is flawlessly acted by ~ 
group of top English 
p~ofessionals, and its sharp 
dialogue, rich Academy Award-
winning Tudor cosumes, grand 
settings, and tense emotional 
impact all contribute to produce 
one of the year's finest films. 

Directed by Charles Jarrott, 
the story is of Henry VIII, King of 
England in the early 1500's and 
his courtship of young Anne 
Boleyn (while he is still married 
to Katherine of Aragon). Anne is 
no mere mistress, however . She 
spurns Henry's rising passion 
and declines to share his bed until 
he'll let her share his throne. She 
taunts, teases, and demands until 
finally seduced. The film follows 
Henry's break with the Roman 
Catholic Church when he decides 
to divorce Katherine to marry 
Anne (his second wife of six ) and 
his ultimate break with Anne 
when she cannot provide him 
with a male heir. 

Richard Burton is in excellent 
fo~ and voice as a funny, 
louhsh, sometimes wise and 
finally despicable and unfeeling 
Henry who expresses so little 
love for Anne once he's got he 
and so little pain about killing 
her. 

dollars for the symphony. 
A pretty little story so far ; well, here comes the 

sad but true ending. This Tuesday I received word 
that the concert was to be postponed. Investigation 
revealed that there just doesn 't seem to be any 
support for the affair either on campus or in the 
local area. After talking with some of the people 

~oncerned I learned that in two days of ticket selling 
m the La Jolla-Pacific Beach area , a grand total of 

~ee of the $.25 pairs were sold. On the university 
slde of the p1cture, a fantastic total of 28 tickets 
were purchased, all in the one-to two-<lollar range. 
Ther.e are 10,000 members of the university com-
~un1ty, 5000 students and 5000 staff; this sale of 28 
tickets represents about one-fourth of one per cent 
of the total . 

What the whole affair boils down to is who is going 
to get the shaft for not supporting the symphony. 
Are we going to get another stadium program 
where the citizens will be asked to pay for the profit 
and enjoyment of a minority, or will the burden of 
support fall on the shoulders of those most able to 

bea~ the cost? In this matter I am not particularly 
talking about the students; their turn will come. 
What I am talking about are the well-to-do both 
here at the university and in the surrO\{nding 
community. These are the people who attend the 
symphony and reap both the cultural and prestige 
benefits. If there is simply no support for the 
s~pho.ny either in the local community or at the 
unIvers1ty, then let 's be honest about it and not soak 
the poor taxpayer with bleeding-heart rhetoric. 

It is one of his very best screen 
roles. 

Genevieve Bujold, a gifted 
Canadian actress, plays the ill-
fated though shrewd-beyond-her-
years Anne and is a delightful 
surprise. She is phenomenal 
considering thilt English is not 
her native lar.~uaf'~ and that this 
is only her third fL..: . J.fer Anne is 
clever, wily, and rt. â¢ .:mtless in 
having her own way with Henry 
and refusing to surrender. She

"Anne," in bringing the Tudor 
!)eriod with its larger-than-life 
intrigues and brinkmanship to 
the screen, is extremely suc-
cessful. The script does have one 
structural ~ealmeSs, though. It 
does not convince us that after all 
these years of waiting for Ann 
(after he has defied Rome, risked 
war, and disemboweled friends to 
get her), Henry would turn 
against her when she gives birth 
to a daughter. And in spite of it 
all, the film does lack the spare 
eloquence and unremitting 
dramatic thrust that made "A 
Man for All Seasons" such an 
electrifying experience and hard-
to-equal model of historical 
drama.

Tonight is Comedy Night for

Sunday night's Muir Cinema 
Series is presenting a 1931 
German classic (with subtitles), 
" The Threepenny Opera." Based 
on the play by Bertolt Brecht, it is 
a social satire with music 
produced by a brilliantly talented 
and courageous group in Berlin 

on the eve of Hitler 's seizure of 
power. It conjures up a world of 
beggars, thieves and prostitutes 

. in an imaginary London at the 
end of the 19th century with a 
universal theme of ironic 
disenchantment and wry op-
timism. 

Born of Brecht's social irony 
and a comment on the society he 
lmew in Berlin between world 
wars, the film is a timeless ex-
travaganza with a biting con-

tempt for sham. Its still-popular 
music written by Kurt Weill 
combines sentiment and 
cynicism and includes " Mack the 
Knife" and " Pirate Jenny." 

Though the original prints of 
this film were destroyed by the 
Third Reich, a complete negative 
has been reconstructed and 
" Threepenny Opera" is often 
cited on lists of the "Top Ten" in 
cinema history. 

All of us hate to see empty cans and bottles lousing 
up what's left of a beautiful country. 

It's too bad packaging technology today isn't 
as exotic and convenient as the gimmicks and 
gadgets on the TV thrill shows; like you, we'd like 
nothing better than for every empty can and 
bottle to self-destruct. Someday, soon, things will 
be different, though ... because we and a lot of 
other concerned people are all working on the 
problem in earnest. 

Meantime, there is a foolproof way to keep cans

Co-Ho.t. For Major Evtlnt 
Triton Crew Rows In San 
Diego Regatta Tomorrow 

George C.mpbell 
Sports Writer 

Following a tuneup victory in the Santa Barbara Regatta, the UCSD 
Crew, along with San Diego State, will host the San Diego Invitational 
Rowing Regatta tomorrow on Mission Bay. 

The Tritons' lightweight varisity eight oar crew braved rough water 
and high winds in Santa Barbara to win its event with a time of 6:58.9 
to best UC Santa Barbara and San Diego State. 

Tomorrow's event will find nine intercollegiate crews rowing the 
fine San Diego Mission Bay course. The regatta is being sponsored by 
Mission Bay Associates, and organized by the crew coaches at UCSD 
and San Diego State, Bill Gebur and Del Beekley respectively. The 
Zlac Rowing Club has also been invaluable in the planning and 
organizing of this major regatta. 

The universities and colleges sending crews to this event inc' :1e 
Stanford, UCLA, UC Santa Barbara, UC Irvine, cal State Long Beach, 
Loyola, and Orange Coast College. The host teams are UCSD and San 
Diego State. In all, more than 30 crews will be fighting for top honors 
which go to only five teams. 

The shells will launch from Bahia Point and race the 2,000 meter 
course beginning at the north end of Mission Bay with the finish line at 
Venura Point. The first racds scheduled to start at 7:45 a .m., with 
subsequent races beginning every 15 minutes until noon. 

The early races of the day include the singles and the heats for the 
Frosh, Junior Varsity, and Varsity Heavyweights. At 9:30 a .m ., the 
girls from the Zlac Rowing Club will take over the water to race 1,000 
meters in their four~ar shells. At 10 a.m. the finals are scheduled to 
begin, with the lighweight varsity followed by the heavyweig~t fours . The Triton baseballer s were looking for tougher 

competition after demolishing Southern california 
College 1fHl April 14, and found it two days later 
when Biola dumped UCSD 9-4 . 

Leading the way in the victory over Southern 
california College was hurler John Weger , who 
combined with Bill Jones for the two-hit shutout, 
and s troked three hits to drive in four runs for the 

The Tritons go at it again this afternoon against ~ 
Occidental College on their Los Angeles campus

Thinclads fall 
Twice, Await 
In vitationals, 
AIIÂ·Cal Meet 
The Triton thinclads wound up 

with a second and third in two 
triangular track meets in the past 
two weeks. 

April 11 it was Azusa-Pacific 
and the Los Angeles Police Track 
Cfub outscoring the Tritons. 
UCSD tallied 47 points in the 
meet, but Azusa tallied 74 to win, 
followed by L.A. Police with 51. 

The only-first places scored by 
Tritons were in the javelin, with 
Mike Seaback throwing the spear 
159 feet, and a 13-foot pole vault 
by Don Nelson. 

April 18, UCSD hosted La 
Verne College and San Diego 
Track Club in a three-way meet, 
and barely edged La Verne as 
San Diego Track Club ran away 
from everyone. 

With four key men missing 
from the Triton ranks, the team 
pulled together in weaker events 
and were sited by Coach Skief for 
a good overall effort. The final 
score found San Diego Track 
Club with a whopping margin of 
103, to 40 for UCSD and 39 for La 
Verne. 

The Tritons find themselves 
idle this weekend, and are using 
this layoff period In preparation 
for the Orange Invitational at 
Chapman, May 2. UCSD will then 
compete in the Riverside In.

ship tournament Wednesday and Thursday, April 29 and 30. 

UC San Diego, United States International University, Whittier, and 
Claremont-Mudd College have already been selected to participate in 
tomorrow's District III tournament, with the winner and probably the 
second-place team given the opportunity to advance to the national 
competition. Admission to the District III tournament tomorrow is

Eight top-flight schools will participate in the NAIA Volleyball 
Finals. The first three place winners of last year's National TournaÂ· 
men~efending NAIA Volleyball Champion Earlham College from 
Richmond, Indiana ; George Williams College of Illinois ; and UC San 
Diego-are favored , and will be participating along with schools from 
california, Texas, illinois, Iowa, Indiana, West Virginia, and New 
York. 

The eight finalists will playa round robin schedule, with the top four 
teams going into the championship bracket and the bottom four teams 
entering the consolation bracket. There will be a total of 36 matches 
played in the UCSD gymnasium during the tw~y event. The round 
robin schedule will be set up with playoffs to determine all eight posi-
tions in the final standings. All of the matches will be played under 
United States Volleyball Association rules. 

Howard Hunt, Athletic Director at UC San Diego, will serve as the 
tournament director, in charge of organization and running the 
tournament. Ivan Guevera, volleyball coach at Whittier College, cali-
fornia, is the president of the NAIA Volleyball Coaches Association 
and along with Ted Runner, athletic director of the University of Red-
lands, California, a member of the NAIA Executive Committee, will 
serve as a coordinator of the tournament. Glen Davies, assistant to the 
Executive Secretary of the NAIA, will represent the National Body of 
the NAIA. As tournament director, Howard Hunt has secured five of 
the top six volleyball officials in the country to referee the NAIA finals, 
along with the nation's top four scorekeepers, to Insure a top-flight 
operation by host school UCSD. 

This will be the first national tournament held on UCSD's campus, 
and the first NAIA-conducted tournament ever held on the West Coast. 
The NAIA conducts 16 national tournaments for colleges of smalf and 
moderate enrollment, and was the first collegiate athletic governing 
body to conduct an intercollegiate National Volleyball Tournament, 
last year, at George Williams College, Downers Grove, Illinois. 

UC San Diego's team, in only its second year of competition, is 
coached by Chuck Millenbah and assisted by Jim Hurley. The starting 
lineup for the Tritons is as follows: 

Kerry Klosterman-Senior, 21, 6-1, 170 Ibs., second year of college 
volleyball participation, El Cajon, california. 

Dick Reithe.nnann--Senior, 22, /Hi, 200 lbs., second year of college 
volleyball participation, Burbank, california. 

Earl Holmes-Junior, 20, 6-2, 170 lbs., Hollywood, California . 
Arthur Brownstein-Sophomore, 19, 5-9, 160 Ibs., Santa Monica , 

california. 
Christopher Oberg- Junior, 19, 6-3, f551bs., La Jolla, california. 
Jeff Gorrell-Sophomore, 19, lHI, 160 Ibs., San Diego, california: 
Tim Rose-Junior, 19, 6-4, 190 Ibs. , Riverside, California. 
Most of the top players have returned from last year 's highly suc-

cessful UCSD team. According to Coach Millenbah, the Tritons could 
win the District III competition and place very high in the national 
tournament " if we playas well as we are capable." The strongest 
hitters and best blockers, according to coach Millenbah, are Kerry 
Klosterman and Dick Reithermann, both of whom were selected for 
the 1969 National All-Tournament Volleyball Team. Coach Millenbah 
also noted Art Brownstein and Jeff Gorrell as the team's best setters. 

Admission for the two day National Tournament finals will be $2 for 
general admission anil $1 for students. The ticket is good for all 
matches both days and allows a pass-out privilege at any time. Tickets 
will be available at the door on the day of the tournament. 

Health food Dangers Aired 
continued from page 5 

newly-found interest to immediate extremes with dire results . Even 
with something as seemingly innocuous as health foods the result can 
be disconcerting. You need oniy observe a health food store for a few 
minutes to find the pathetic health food-addict housewife, bordering on 
hypochondria , who regards the health food store owner as some kind 
of major deity. 

Health Food Tips (which are reasonably uncontested) 
l. What is crucial is not only what you eat but how you eat it. You 
should oniy eat when hungry and never when extremely nervous or 
irritated. It is important to chew slowly and thoroughly . A short 
leisurly walk after a meal is a good idea also . 
2. Avoid : 

A. carbonated drinks - the stomach doesn 't jilroove on them. 
B. Cold drinks during meals - they interfere with digestive juices. 
C. Foods made from denatured substances - These substances 

include white sugar, starch, arrowroot, tapioca , poUched rice (white ), 
pearl barley, white flour , and aged cheeses. 

D. Spicy condiments - pepper, mustard, and even salt can irritate 
the stomach lining . 

E . Excessively fatty or oily substances. 
F . Foods that contain a lot of chemicals whose names you can 't 

pronounce. 
3. Conswne Instead things Uke milk, fresh vegetables and fruits , nuts, 
lean meats, fish , cottage cheese, yogurt, honey, brown sugar , brown 
rice, wheal bread, whole grains, eggs, vegetable olls , and soybeans, if 
you 're ambitious. 

After. f ine set from the center-seller , the T riton 's

Defense Contracts 
act can be considered as war related, even love making," he said. 
"Our view is that war related activities should be restricted to applied 
work on military weapons or military hardware or military 
organization (such as studies of fighting techniques and coun-
terinsurgency) . They have no place on a university campus, but I 
don't believe it follows that we should forbid the faculty from carrying 
out research just because it is sponsored by the Department of 
Defense or Atomic Energy Commission." 

UCandWar 

The University of California, York said, has long been involved with 
work for the Department of Defense. One contract dates back to World 
War II . "At that time, the government asked us to help it. But now we 
propose what we can do for them." These requests come privately 
from faculty members who hear through colleagues of projects to be 
sponsored by the government. 

Starting in World War II, he said, the University faculty "were 
encouraged to get involved. It was seen as their contribution to the war 
effort. 

"There was almost universal tolerance toward classified research 
on campus during the Korean War" at which time McGill says he 
received his first job in defense research. York went on to say that 
because of the patriotic attitude of professors during the Second World 
War, laboratories were developed as "a convenience to the govern-
ment. Security in the University was poor, and bad practices grew up 
for ten to fifteen years. A lot of people even got Ph.D.'s for theses that 
could not be read by department faculties' because they were 
classified." 

A move to limit government research, however, followed the war 
when the Berkeley faculty in 1950 outlawed classified research from 
their campus. Security measures at Lawrence Radiation Laboratory 
at Livermore were lifted, and the faculty began to question the 
propriety of carrying out war-related work. 

The Regents had been asked to manage Livermore and Los Alamos 
labs, and according to York, " their present view is that they manage 
them in the national interest." As a result, he said, all the Regents 
must have security clearances, and those members of a special 
subcommittee have even stricter clearances. 

UCSO's faculty passed its policy on classified research on Nov. 14, 
1967, and is now in effect, McGill said. The basis of the change in of-
ficial attitude is swnmarized in a speech by the Chancellor in January, 
delivered to a meeting of the American Civil Liberties Union: 

"I do not believe that it is ethically justified for a university to 
sponsor classified research on campus. The imposition of restrictions 
and secrecy in an open academic community where tradition supports 
the right of access of all members of the academic community to all 
information, is not supportable and probably never has been sup-
portable. Thus the development of centers of classified research on 
university campuses was an ethical breach. 

"The national interest and the national defense are things that must 
concern us all, but neither the national interest nor the national 
defense is served by subverting the basic integrity of our institutions 
of higher learning."
