Silx.Qn replacement 
Decision is 
exp ect ed 
this week 

By CRAIG KAKUDA 
Siaff Writer 

Amidst a projected budget 
deficit. a governor intent on 
cu tting l'ducational resources. 
and rising registration fees. 
the Cmversity of CalJfornia 
Regent s must elect a new 
Regent PreSident to run the 
en! ire UC system. 

The llC system will most 
likel y see tougher times in the 
years to come. The Regent 
President must be dynamiC 
enough to meet 't he se 
challenges which the future 
holds. "T he cr iteria for 
se lec ting a UC president 
"hould include that he or she 
be ahle to \\ alk on \\ ater," sa id 
Regent Edward W. Carter. 

DaVid axon. 62, announced 
his resignation as Regent 
President on las t Labor Dav 
weekend. axon. who has 
served as President for nine 
years. has received the highest 
praise from his peers. His 
successor is expected to be 
announced Feb. 18. 

An Academic Senate (A ) 
search committee, headed by 
UCLA's Ralph T urner, was 
immediately formed in early 
fall to select a new president 
by July 1. 1983. The AS search 
committee has smce honed 
around 300 names down to a 
much smaller list, and has 
submitted it to a Regents's 
special committee. chaired by 
Dean Watkins. for final 
'-,( reen mg. 

On!,'lnally . the onl\' Regents 
con s Ielered for t he seven· 
member committee were the 

Lie ute nant Governor Leo T . McCarthy having lunch with Ch an cellor Richard C. Atkin .. on 
during a n inform a l v is it to UCSD last Friday. McCarthy, a Regent ex-officio, took the 
o pportunity to tou r the campus with Atkinson d uring a visit to an Diego. 

20, 12·year Regents. appomted 
by the governor. The other 
eight Regents and ex officio 
mem ber ' have shorter terms 
and are appointed through 
other channels. 

But becau e of the 
importance, and of the effects. 
that the Regent President will 
have, Student Regent Linda 
Sabo st rongly urged that she 
also be included in the 
selection proces . as well as an 
Alumni Regent from Berkeley. 
"They finally m\'ited us to 
participate. but we couldn't 
\Ote," said Sabo. In addition, 
there are three other ex officio 
Inon·\otmg) members of the 

committee. including Govern· 
or Deukmej lan , \', ho IS 
essentially there in name only. 

Though she can not vote, 
Sabo, representing the UC 
s tudents, s till ha an 
influential role in the 
selection. "The t udent 
Regent is likened to. We're all 
pretty much equal." she said. 
"We want the best person for 
the universi ty. I'm gl\'en the 
same amount of re.pen when 
we reahze this" abo added 
that if she. and Just a fe\\ 
others, really oppo"ed a 
nominee, that person might 
not be considered. 

Sabo empha~ized the 

importance of secreq. If ne\\ . 
leaked out that a certam 
candidate \ .... as being senousl\ 
con idered. it could produce 
adverse effects for the 
candidate at the other job. 

"It' a funny kind of 
proces" aid abo. "It', 0 
sensitive. The Committee is 
meeting a lot and trying 
sincerely to fi nd the be t 
person 'for all constltutents. 
Bu t we can't talk about it." 

The Regents are allowed 
closed ..,e..,sions If thev are

After graduating from high 
school in psychedelic colored

t he reason we go to a 
university i ' that it is an 
academic community, not so 
we can f>ee free Marx brot hers 
movies and be clo 'er to the 
beach. I have nothing as;ainst 
tre side of the scholar' life 
which is relaxation; even pre· 
med sl udent~ must watch 
M*A*S*H occasionally. But 
for the thousands of dollars, 
we, our parents, and the 
CalifurnIa taxpayers (we and 
our parents) spend on OUI 
transition from town to gown. 
the community should be as 
perfectly academic as possible. 
utSD has an excellent 
collection of professors, 
classes. guest lectures and 
libraries, with at least a 
beginning in art and music. 
but it s bookstore is a famine' 
stricken midget, and shows no 
signs of becolllll1g largcr or

Revelle "shafted" on apartments 
Editor: 

Undergraduate s tudents 
ha ve no voice. They' li\e with 
the decisions of campus 
administration withoul Ihe 
benefil or viable Input 
channels. Clearly, this is true 
of the plans for ca mpus 
apartmcnt building. As one 
Revelle st udent put it, "Weare 
being royally shafted!" What 
is this abou t you may ask? 

Once again Reve ll e i~ 
depn ved of an opportu nit y to 
gain much needed apartment 
housing. Currently, weare the 
only college in UCSD Without 
such facilt ies, and ou r college 
is the most rapidly expanding 
of the four . We are required ttl 
house students from other 
college~ in our dorms and thus, 
only about 30 percent of 
Revelle student" li ve in college 
hou~ing. This IS a substan· 
tiall y lower percent than the 

other colleges house. When 
Revelle was originally built , It 
was prom ised 100 perrent 

h()u~lng expansion. None of 
this has happened . 

One year ago, the [JCSD 
Campus Community Planning 
Committe supported building 

plan~ for three 'iites on campus 
at Warren , Reve!le. and Third . 
They stated that Revelle was 
t he easiest place of the three to 
build because utilities and 
pi ping had a lready been laid 
down. 

Yet. recently, for some 
mysterious rea"on, the 
Committee changed its 
proposal for the three sites to 
on Iy one site at Warren. 

I~eve ll e students will be 
allocated none of these uni ts 
and they w III lose t hei r spaces 
al the Mes,1 Apartments like 
all the otht'r colleges. With th 
one site plan. Muir wi ll lose 

approximalely 2.2 percent of 
its housing. However. with the 
three site plan . they would be 
allocated spaces at the Revelle 
site. Third College will receive 
housing from both proposals, 
but in the three si te plan it will 
be on their campus. 

Beca u se of the new 
redistribution of the debt 
serv ice, Revel Ie s tud ent s' 
housing fees will rise about 
$400 to $500 at no benefit to 
themselves. The price 
difference between the three 
s ite plan and one site plan is 
minimal. It would cost 
!'i t udents $5 more a month , but 
with the three si tes they would 
receive apart men t spaces.

not only the advantage of 
finding anything one wants, 
but. in a well stocked 
bookseller res ides t he real 
tempt ation of education, each 
bou nd copy a colorfu l 
reliquary of a literary saint. 
One can even find one author 
with choice of illustrator, or 
one illustrator \\ ith chOICe of 
author. ThiS street is the 
books In pnnt catalogue 
materialized. 

Were UC D circled with 
purveyors of Ink·stained 
paper, \\ hich crowds of 
scholars could bibliophile past. 
the UCSU bookstore would 
have no need to be anything 
special. and indeed would 
hardl y need to exist. But no 
such circle exists. tTni\'t'rsily 
Towne Cent re. even named 
after us. on l\' has B. Dalton's 
and Walden, two suburban 
clones in pop book chain". La 
Jolla has Warwick's and 
Hun ter's, but they are the 
same size as the ot ~ers. with 
more or less tne same 
selection. The UCSD store 
adds to the repetit,on - no 

bi~er than the chain stores 

and no more specia lized. It is 
like going to Paris for the food 
and di"cO\'cri ng that Maxim's 
has been replaced by 
McDonald's_ 

One can order any book in 
print , which is the only 
advantage of our bookstore, 
but the wait ing time is a 
month or more. after which 
the volume may have lost its 
usefulness, and almo<.;[ 
certainly its seduct iveness. 
More importantly, a book has 
no appeal embodied in two 
lines of a massive newprint 
catalogue. They do not attract 
new readers or new reading, 
and that is a major flaw of 
education in our academic 
community, which I~ 
supposed to offer new scope. 
nol obscure it in indifference. 

Wh('n we graduai e f 1'0111 
college. as we did from high 
school, and become gainfully 
employed, or become writers. 
\\e will leave our professors, 
cia sse... and guest lecture'> 
behind . What will be left will 
be books. a passion for them 
and a delight and developed 
taste in reading them. as w('11 
as the volumes th emselves. To

The police are taking care of Letters to the Editor 
the "real" criminals in society The Bible is neither 

By ROGEn SIMON 
I. .. " Anl/clcs Time, S~ndkmc 

Ann Michovich is the kind of 
woman who reminds you .of 
your mother no matter what 
your mother looks like. 

She is five feel. four inches 
tall and weighs abou t 135 Ibs. 
She is 5f), the mother of four, 
and has been married for 28 
years. She will be a 
grandmother soon. 

She is the kind of old· 
fashioned woman who does 
not like to remove her wedding 
ring- unless she absolutely has 
to. 

WhICh is why "he was <;0 
upset when the police made 
her do it before throwing her 
1I1tO a jail cell. 

Ann Micho\'ich IS charged 
\\,Ith beating up a cop. 

The cop works 111 C icero. lIl.. 
a town not nnh famous as 
ha\'lng been the -horne base of 
AI Capone, but \\orthy of a full 
page in Till/ £! magazlI1e this 
week for belllg one of the most 
racist communities in 
America. 

The officer, who IS SIX 
inches taller and 30 Ib ~. 
heavier than Mr~. Micho\lch. 
has signed a complaint saymg 
that she: " .. . without legal 
Justification caused bodily 
harm ... by strikll1g said officer 
about the back, shou lders and 
neck with her fist.., ..... 

"I hardl) even know how to 
make a fist ." ~1rs . Micho\'ich 
said. "I never even ha\'(' hit my 
0\\ n children. , ever." 

The officer said: "She came 
up behind me and started 
pounding me on the back of my 
neck with her fi sts. Then she 
tried to kick me." 

Mrs. Michovich li ves on 
Chicago's West ide with her 
hu sba nd George. a cit y 

employe. Their son, Gary. 24, 
has a bachelor's degree in 
Italian literature from Loyola 
University and is current ly' 
s tudying for his master's 
degree in international finance 
in Arizona . 

La, t weekend, Gary flew 
into the city to attend a 
friend' s wedding. While 
driving through Cicero, hewas 
ticketed by police for gOll1g 36 
in a 25 mph zone and going 
through a stop sign. 

He su rrendered hi~ driver's 
license, but later went to the 
police station to post a cash 
bond and get his license back. 

His s is ter. Karen.19,and his 
mom. Ann. we nt \\Ith him. 

At the statIOn, there was an 
argument bet ween Gary and 
the IXllice over whet her he 
cou ld get his liccn<;e back 

During the argument. Mrs. 
J\1ichovich ~avs she walked 
over to a police-officer.louchcd 
him on the arm and a<;ked 
what the trouble was. 

Thc officer then charged her 
with two misdemeanors: 
battery and obstructing a 
pol icc officer. 

According to Mrs. Micho· 
\ ich, the officer.., t hen began 
~hoving her t()\\ ard a cell. 

"I wa ... pt.'trifled.'· she said. 
"I had ne\er e\ en been in a 
police station before. I was 
cry mg. I was weak.lVly mouth 
was dr)-. I thought I was going 
to have a heart at tack." 

Mr<;. Michovich was finally 
allowed to make a phone call 
and a relati\'(' bailed ever\,one 
out. 

"I was also fingerprinted 
and had my mugshot taken," 
Mrs. Michovich said. "During 
my mugshot , J said I was not a 
criminal , so I was going to 
smile." 

The police allowed her to 
smile. 

According to Karen. Ihe 
police told her that her arrest 
would prevent her from e\'er 
becoming a court reporter , 
which is what she is studying 
to become. 

Accordll1g to Gary , the 
police told him to forget about 
entering I he world of 
international finance. 

Mrs. Micho\ ich faces up toa 
year in jail 

The police officer. 34, ... ays 
he is the injured party. He says 
Mrs. Michovich ws a busivc 
and that she attacked him 
from behind. 

''!'\e got my supervisor and 
four or fiVE' other police 
officers who are read\' to 
testify to that," hL said. -

I asked him if he was reall~ 
gomg to try to com ince a jur~' 
that little :\Ir". Mlch()\ ieh 
attacked an armed pol iceman. 
surrou nded by other armed 
policemen, In -the middle of a 
police'itation. 

"I am reach. to testlf\'," he 
sa id . "Just ' because she 
resembles my mother, Ju~t 
because she's m\' mother\; 
age, doesn't mean'she gets to 
hit me." 

The prosecutor's officl' I~ 
proceeding agaln'-l ;"\lrs . 
l\1ichuvlch. 

I asked her I f she was 
prepared to go tll t he Big 
House. 

"I didn't thll1k jails e\ en had 
room for people like me," she 
said with a sob. 

That's what all arch -
criminals think. M r". 
Michovich. 

But for the truly dangerous. 
our system of justice can 
always find room for one more.

More to the Bible than science 
continued from page 2 
were seen for very small 
objects. Rather, the assump· 
tions of classical mechanics 
were redefined because it was 
found that they were no longer 
valid for describing the 
movement of very small 
particles. 

In the same way. the 
problems existing in our 
understanding of the Bible are 
not necessarily cause for 
rejection of the whole work. In 
fact, considering that the 
collected writings span a 
period of a millenium or more, 
the consistency of the 
doctrines is really quite 
amazing. To see this, however, 
one must real ize that the Bible 
is not intended to be a 
cientific textbook, and thus to 

compare it to "modern books 
on cience" is like comparing 
elephants and pomegranates. 
The creation account in 
Gene is was not meant to be 
published in Evolutionary 
Biology. Its message is clearly 
that 1) God is our Creator (the 
mechanism belongs to the 
scientific method), 2) God 

gi\'es life to man, and 3) man 
and woman are created to 
support and help each other. 
Even the aut hor of Genesis 
knew that men and women 
have the same number of ribs, 
so he must have had a purpose 
other than scientific accuracy 
in mind when he wrote. 

We have already seen that 
science cannot touch the 
question of God's existence. 
This insight spills over into 
our consideration of miracu· 
lou s, supernatural occur· 
rences in the Biblical record. If 
we assume, as the Bible doe , 
that God exists, then why are 
the "impossible stories" and 
"biologica l impossibilities" 
unworthy of belief? If the God 
of the Bible is the Creator of 
the physical law s and 
biological principles that we 
live by, i it impossible or 
illegal for him to suspend or 
change those laws a he sees 
fit? Again, we must conclude 
that the veracity of miracles is 
inaccessible to the scient ific 
method . Science cannot say, 
" Because this has never 
happened, it never will." It can 

on Iy conclude that "This event 
is highly unlikely, s ince il has 
never been observed. " Thanks 
to the presupposilions of the 
scientific method and 
quantum physics, a "scientific 
impossibility" is usually a self· 
cont radiction . 

In summary. belief in 
science and belief in the Bible 
are not mutually exclusive. 
The domains of truth covered 
by the two fields, while 
essent ially different do overlap 
in place . It is these areas of 
mutual concern that can often 
attract cientific thinkers to 
the Chri tian faith. As a 
Christian trained in the 
biological sciences. I too, am 
disturbed by the tendency of 
religious groups to shroud 
difficult questions wit h too-
easy answers, because Biblical 
Christianity is more than 
emotions and mysticism. It 
also demands our minds. It is a 
historical, reasonable, 
verifiable. and even elegant 
system, and dealing honestly 
with dou bts and questions can 
only help to further unfold its 
truth. Gary Lee

New Pres. UCSD CO-OPS face same kind of problems 
continued from page 1 
ment, performance. compen-
sat io n . or dismissa l of 
u n iver ity officers or 
employee ." according to their 
charter. 

Though the committee 
sessions are private. abo said. 
"{ feel good about what' going 
on.tt 

The committee. hopes to 
announce its selection on Feb. 
18, when it meets in Los 
A n g~lses . Until then. 
candIdate and committee 
member are declini ng. 
comment. 

Chancellor Atkinson would 
not say what his plans would 
be if he were to be selected. 
other than . ' 'I'm very happy 
here." Saxon currently earns 
$94.265. Atkinson. with les 

'e~iorit y, earns $76.000. 
One of the mo, t active 

things the Board of Directors 
do~ is appoint a' pre ' ident ," 
saId abo. "If the Univer ity is 
n?t running well . they replace 
hIm. They let the Pres ident 
run it." 

One of the criteria for 
se lect ion is that " The 
P!,esiden.t must have di ting-
ul s hed Intellectual tature 
commanding the respect of th~ 
academic world." said Sabo. 

In addition. the Pre ident 
hould be able to dea l 

effectively with all of the 
people repre senting the 
various can tituent of the UC 
system. and should have a 
good knowledge of the current 
problems endemic to the 
University of California. 

continued from page 1 
members can bring up any 
IS ues of concern. and store 
policy changes are discussed 
and voted on during these 
meetings. 

Of all the co-ops. Assort ed 
Vinyl is the only one with the 
problem of too many members, 
because only two people are 
needed to man the store. 
Currently. the membership at 
Assorted Vinyl is limited to 35 
workers. Prospect Ive mem -
bers must put their names on a 

waiting li s t and arc a llowed to 
join as other members leave. 

All the other co-ops welcome 
new members at anytime. 
Mem bership is not limited to 
s tudents ei ther. Anyone from 
th e communit y willing to 
contribute time and energy to 
a co-op may join . 

The store front co-ops are all 
organized in the same general 
manner. T here are anywhere 
from two to II pa id core 
members re po nsible for 
coordinating vo lu n teers. 

... 

ccb 
.. - .. 

ordering s uppli es. and 
operating the s tore . Most core 
members are paid for a set 
number of hours each week, 
but they end up working far 
more th an thaI. 

The num ber of \'olunteer 
workers in these co-ops ranges 
from five at t he General Store 
to 40 at the Che Cafe. Any 
major policy decis ions have to 
be approved by all the core 
members . 

A major problem which 
effect s the co·ops in the 

Student Center is lack of 
s pace. As Student Center 
Facilities Manager Maryann 
MClson ackow ledgcd, "Th(' co-
ops wcre crammed into s paces 
not meant for their organiza· 
ti ons." Thi s problem is 
expected to be resolved if 
another building is added to 
the Student Center. 

Another inherent problem 
fa cing th e co·ops is th e 
transient nature of members. 
New core and volunteer 
members have to be continuo 
ally trained (0 replace the 
me m bel'S w ho e"en t 1I3 II y 
gradua t e or lea ve. 

As Chr ista Gostenhofer. a 
worker a t theCheCafe.stated. 
"A formulil.ed sta tement of 
pu rpose a nd opera t i ng 
procedures. on paper. is 
needed." 

Bob Corlew. of the Genera l 
Store. sta ted. "There I" a lack 
of leader s hip. a nd more 
development is needed wi thll1 
co·ops rather than among co-
ops." 

Scott Kessler. a founder of 
th e Food Co·oP. said . "Co-ops 
ha\'e to set up a st ructure -
guidelines to go by." Former 
co·op ad vi ser Marco LiMa ndri 
commented. "Co·ops must 
have a balance between 
democracy and efficiency -
and leadership keeps -that 
balance going." And ac ting 

tud e n t Center DIrec tor 
Raymond Dye also believes. 
"Co·ops need mechanisms to 
replace o; tudent s whi c h 
graduate. " 

" Hopefully. we will have a 
very good presldrnt very 
soon." said Sabo. 

The Ge ne ral Sto~e ~ffers a wide range of m e r chandis e. from Chinese change purses to 
baseball hats . despite Its "sp ace probl em." 

Communication between 
mem bers of the va rious co-ops 
IS another problem th a t 
members are working on .

will experience migraines as well. If others in the family 
have migraines. and not the parents, then the risk is about 
23 percent. Most migraine begin to occur anywhere from 
the late teens to the ea rly 30s. 

What is a migraine headache? 
The term "m igraine" comes from the French. derived 

from the Greek word hemi crama, which means half a head . 
Classically·. a migraine headache is an intermittent. 
pulsat ing. pounding. severe headache. It is usually on one 
side of the head . However, 30 percent .of the tIme the 
headache is diffu se. The paIn ma y radiate to the neck or face. 
H can occur as frequently as every few days or as 
infrequent Iy as once a year. Typically, it will last for several 
hours to a day. There are often associated symptoms. Light 
and noise sensitivity is common and the patient will prefer a 
dark . Quiet room. Nausea, loss of appetite. and vomiting can 
occur. Cold hands and feet and numbness of the calp is not 
unusual. 

In one·third of the cases there is an aura . An aura is a 
prodrome or pre-headache type symptom . Usually the aura 
is consistent for an individual. The aura may involve visual 
complaints such as blind spots, flashing lights, fuzzy lines, 
blurred vision or double vision . Some wil note dizziness. 
numbness. tingling, or localized weakness. Occasionall y. a 
visual hallucination occurs. Lewis Carroll, authorof Alice in 
W01lderlal1d, suffered from mIgraines and saw the di 'lorted 
fIgures of "Alice." Of interest. sometimes only the pre-
headache symptom occurs and the headache does not follow . 

Any patient with a chronic. persistent. or recurrent 
headache should be seen by a ph ysician. A physician will 
often ask some of the following questions: 

Can migraines be controlled? 
The cause of a migraine headache IS felt to be secondary to 

blood vessel diameter changes. It is know that the blwd 
vessels to the bram and head con'>tnct (narre)\\) in the pre· 
headahe phase. Then. in the headache pha~e they dilate 
(widen ). The skull and bram are actually not senSItive tu 
pam Rather. the scalp. blood w:..,seb. mu"c1e~ of the head 
and neck. brain covenng and nen-es play the role of causing 
the pam of any headache. 

Stress and fatIgue are major factors than can precipitate a 
migrall1e headache. Hormonal changes also playa role as 
e\'idenced by the mcreased mCldence of migraine headaches 
In women on the birth control pill. It is unclear what role 
foods play in causing a headache. There are nu well-
controlled stud ies to answer this. It is known that for some 
people certain foods WIll precipitate migraIne headaches. 
Some of the more common foods implicated 1I1clude: hard 
cheeses. caffeine. chocolate. nuts . lima and navy beans. 
alcohol, bananas. onions, monosodium glutamate, and 
nitrates as in hot dogs or bacon. For the va t majority. a 
particular food plays no role. Obviou Iy. no one would 
develop a migraine headache form all of these or even most . 

Before considering eliminating foods, your doctor should 
be consulted . Much more important than food elimmatlOn I~ 
eati ng three well balanced meal:; a day . It is known that 
migraine headaches can be helped by avoiding both extremes 
of fasting of overeating_ Both provoke blodd \es~el diamter 
changes. Person experiencll1g mlgrames should also a\'OId 
s leeping more than 10 hours a day 

Your physician should be con-;ulted for any complaint:-. ot

Not exactly the Marathon Man 

By JAMES RALPH PAPP 
Slaff Wriler 

I have never run with any 
real pleasure since] Oth grade 
PE, when I was starting out 
around the field at the front of 
the class and a friend , one of 
my dangerous friend s, tripped 
me up. My glasses and tennis 
shoes flew off, Charlie Brown 
fash ion , and r lay on my back 
in the mud ' as a mob of 35 
fitnes s- mad teenagers 
trampled obliviously over me, 
When one of my organizations 
- the San Diego ymphonyof 
all things - decided to ha ve a 
10 kilometer fundraisingrun, I 
\'olunteered to help run it 
instead of running in it. 

To manage a race Oile has to 
get up eariy in the morning, in 
my case about 4 am. That is 
because the runn ers are 
procrastinators, and do not 
know whether they want to 
run 10 kilometers until a few 
houis before it is time to do it. 
In this they are different from 
me, If someone were to come 
up and ask me to run ] 0 
kilometers at any time at all, r 
would know exactly how to 
answer him at that moment. 
In any event , at 4 am I got out 
of bed and donned my Chariots 
0/ Fire costllme ; white 
nannels, blazer, and straw 
hat. (Chariots 0/ Fire is still 
running in Cambridge after

At Balboa Park thc other 
volunteers were ~tanding 
under the moon trying to thaw 
Danis h sweetroll~, a muster of 
non-running people (I met a 
family of baloonists, perhaps 
the ultimate in refusing to use 
one's feet), After mO\'ing 20 
tables in a circle with chairs 
inside, hardy pioneers facing 
the 'lavage Indian attack, we

suffer from the Baron von 
Mun chhusen syndrome, as 
Webster's says 'teller of 
absurdly exaggerated stories.' 

Soon people bega n com i ng to 
col lect entrance forms. 
Fortunately very few of my 
pens were stolen (except by 
other vol unt eers), because 
runners have no places to put 
t hem. By mid -morning the 
ambulances had ominously 
pulled up, and I went over to 
lend a tone to the start of the 
race, since the police 
departments demand~ regis· 
tration be finished a good 
fifteen minutes before to avoid 
a mad rush by fanatical 
procrast inators, More than a 
thousand people had gathered 
to run, among them men in

Jefferson \Vould 
have been proud 

By ROBERT LEONE 

Don't ever say the name 
Thomas Jefferson to a 
cryptographer unless you 
want the poor guy (or gal, 
spooking is now an equal 
opportunity employer) to cry 
into a stein filled with dark 
amber fluids. This usually 
happens with a U.S. born 
history buff who got into 
cipher-solving and creating 
from the amateur side of the 
field . 

Thomas Jefferson's genius 
crea ted the most confusing 
and difficulL to solve or break 
cipher syste m of his 
day ... O.K.. so you want to 
know what a ci pher is , before I 
forget readers do exist who 
don 't know this st uff off the 
tops of their heads. 

A cipher is a method of, 
heck, ju t like in Edgar Allen 
Poe' story "The Gold Bug." 
Yah, one of those. Actually, the 
one featured in the story is a 
rea lly simple one. All the 
printer's symbols Poe larded 
into hiS cryptogram doesn't 
make it any harder to sol\'e. 

Anyway, good old nai\'e, 
nari ve America n Thomas 
Jefferson aced about three 
hundred years of European 
experience and c1e\'erness and 
total devotion and weird 
anecdotes to come up with the 
killer system. 

Oh, my. what anecdotes! 
There was this French guy 
who broke Spain's ';Unbreak-

able" A-], For Diplomatic Use 
Only system into so many 
pieces that th e Spanish 
prosecuted him as a witch in 
the Vatican. The Cardinals 
who ran the courtroom, upon 
learning that the Spanish 
system was a training exercise 
for their codebreakers, 
suspended judgement until 
further evidence was 
presented. I believe the case is 
sti ll pending. 

Anyway, Jeffer on's system 
was so killer, it was the finalist 
in the "Hey, you! Create our 
new Code System " contest 
held during one of the lears he 
was Secretary of State. 

The contest wa down to 
Jefferson's system and a 22-
column columnar transposi -
tion system which everybody 
except the Cypru Chamber of 
Commerce was breaking. The 
Cyprus Chamber of Com-
merce wasn't break ing codes, 
then . 

An yway, Jefferson's system 
lost, because it was a little bit 
more complicated . 

So J efferson's State 
Department never used it. 
Howe\'er, it wa resurrected in 
the late IROOs, and was the. 
LI S. Armv's favorile battle-
field system throughout World 
War II. The Italia ns also used 
it as a medium securit y na val 
ci pher. 

Thomas Jefferson would 
have been proud. 

Wednesday, February 16th 

Marathon man 
continucd from pagc 1:1 
awards ceremony. To anyone 
who hasn't been to a race the 
amount of food is astou nding, 
and I was astounded for at 
least three and a half seconds 
before galloping up to help put 
away part of it. There were 
breads and cheeses, apples and 
oranges, grosses of boltles of 
Calistoga water (which I find 
extremely nasty, but it is 
expensive), yoghurt, fruit 
juices, potato chips, and the 
organizers kept pleading with 
us to have another go at it, and 
take some home for our 
friends, so the trucks could go 
away. That Roman orgy of 
food is my most vivid memory 
of that day 's expanding 
waistline of events. 

For the non -s porting, 
athletic can be just as much 
fun as the sporting. There is 
good food , camaraderie and a 
ca rnival almo phere. There is 
also the exquisite plea ure of 
being able to s it comfortably in 
the sun, s ipping a drink or 
munching a snack, and watch 
other members of the human 
race crawl by in abject 
exhaustion.

The intramural program at

In a fl oor hock e) match th i"

Running Thoughts 
By JEFF SAVA6E and MIKE GREENBERG 

Slaft Wrilcr~ 
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE DEPT. Tn a featu re stury IOlhe 
Los Angeles Times la s t Saturday, BIll Shirley said , "The Lonflict 

. bet ween s ports writer and athlete today oft en is a~ IOtense as the 
rivalry on the field or court . More and more, reporters who tOJI in 
the sports departments of newspapers bruise the ego of 
sensitive athletes , managers and coaches who don't think the 
writers always know what they're talking about and wish they 
would praise their good deeds and ignore their mis takes. " What 
in the world is Shirley talking about? In coveri ng the women's 
volleyball and men's water polo teams in the fall, and now the 
men's and women' , basketball teams, we've never experienced 
this attitude! The players have always made a special effort to 
talk with us, and even compliment our efforts from time to time. 
They are very appreciative of our sincere devotion and appear 
pleased that we are expo~ing the'!l ,to the. public. ~ven whe.n 
times are rough, they realIze that It IS our Job to wnte about It 
objectively. With their understanding, it is obvious that these 
UCSD athletes are far superior to the average athlete , We take 
great pride in sharing this with our readers. 
NOT TO BE BELIEVED DEPT. The International Rodeo 
Associa tion has selected as its Rookie of the Year a daughter of a 
three·time world title holder. The interesting thing is that she is 
on ly 11 years old. Sherry Hearn Blair, a fifth grader from Gore, 
Oklahoma reports that she is an accomplished Pac Man player 
and gets straight As in school. "] don't talk about rodeoing at 
school," she said. HI play football and chase and (do) all those 
things." Several companies have approached the youngster 
about doing commercials, and she has already banked $16,000 in 
1982 earnings. 
WAIT A MINUTE DEPT. After the San Diego Clippers 
defeated the Phoenix Suns 101·100 Thursday night at the Sports 
Arena, there was hooplah galore in the Clipper locker room. 
What's more, there was much discussion of post·season play, as 
in PLAYOFFS. Say what? Are the Clippers as cOl,lfused as LA 
Times writer Bill Shirley? Well, checki ng the stand mgs, perhaps 
not. By equaling last season's total win prod~clion of 17 by ~he 
all·star break, San Diego has a reasonable outSIde shot at makmg 
the playoffs for the first time ever. Six teams from each 
conference advance to the second season, and the Clippers are 
still eight games out of the s ixth position, but they have j ~ st 
begun to play solid basketball the las t fou~weeks orso, Know~ng 
tha t the San Diego public will support a wmner, Donald Sterlmg 
may be having second thought · on selling hi s club. 
COULD IT BE DEPT. Great news for Triton sports fans. If 
the UCSD men's basketball team wins the NAIA Dis trict III 
league title this year, 275 UCSD students will be able to tra\'el

lR The UCSD Guardian 

Women's hoop bows to Cal Baptist 
continued from page 15 
before a UCSD shot found the 
inside of the cylinder, but by 
then, a one point advantage 
had turned into a ix point 
deficit. Down 50-44 with 5: 10 
remaining_ Malone decided to 
try a new and risky com-
bination' playing centers 
Shelley McKeone and Teik 
Francis in the game at the 

same time_ It looked like the 
move was a wi e one when 
McKeone and Francis hit back 
to back jumpers to cut the 
margin to two with four 
minutes left. But then Lancer 
backcou rt duo of J an Hearn 
and Edith Duffey scored eight 
of the next 10 points while the 
Triton s' cold s hooting 
continued. Ultimately , Cal 

v ~ bailers beat Loyola 
continued from page 15 
was sick at the onset of the 
match and had worsened by 
the end of the third game. So 
Bateman was put in for the 
fourth game and the tide began 
to turn_ 

An initial lead sparked by 
Bateman, the "court jester" of 
the team, a~ he calls himself, 
helped keep them in the lead in 
the fourth game (the chest 
Loyola ever got to UCSD wa . 
at 3·2) and took them out of 
their slump of the last two 
games. This game wa won 
handily by a core of 15·10. 

The fifth game, like the 

second , was close up until the 
end. The score alwa ys seemed 
to be tied; first 7·7, next 10-10, 
then 11-11, 12·12, and fina lly 
13·13. UCSD took the game 
and the match wit h a score of 
15·13. 

Dannevik' , praise centered 
on Bateman, the 5- 11 jLnior 
from Manhattan Beach, who 
"took charge in the fourth 
game." Howe\'er. the coach 

empha~;tZed that the whole 
team played well. 

Up next for the Tritons is 
the University of La Verne at 
La Verne. . 

Do you want ... 

Baptist raised its margin to ten 
wi th the aid of a Duffey layup 
and a Hearn 20·foot jumper 
from the baseline. Meanwhile, 
the Triton attack was flacid . 
28 turnovers and a dismal 32 
percent FG shooting. 

As the final buzzer sounded 
with UCSD down by nine, not 
even an open s ix footer would 
fall for the Tritons, That was 
the story of the night.

Running Thoughts 
continued fro 111 page 17 
with the team to Kansas City during the spring break at 
absolutely no co t. The NAIA (National Athletic Intercollegiate 
Association) has approved a full cost grant for all 38 district 
winners across the nation , providing each school with the 
necessa ry fund s to allow 300 individuals to travel to the 
designated playotf site. (UCSD's is Kansas City.) The fund s will 
provide for round trip tickets and accomodations as well as other 
"necessary expenses" (food, spending money, etc,) for up to two 
weeks , Approximately 25 passes will be used for the players, 
coaches, and various athletic department members, leaving 
some 275 passes for UCSD students. In order to obtain a pass , a 
student must write his name and school ID number on a three by 
five card and place it in a box at the door of Triton Pavillion at the 
beginning of each of the three remaining Triton home games. All 
students who have submitted a card at all three games will be 
assured a pass. 

Sports Line: cheaters 
continued from page 16 
individual cheating in sports 
history Ruiz crossed the 
finish line first in recored time. 
alt hough it was discO\ ered 
that she had not run the full 
course, th us being disq ualified 
(my personal theory il-l that she 
took a cab and then 
transferred to t he subway). 
What boggles t he mind is that 
throughout it all. I~ul z still 
claimed her innocence. 

It il-l impossible to know the 
full extent of cheating that 
goes on in sports. There arc no 
statil-ltics, onlv indi\iclual 
testimonies. The eVidence 
seems to indIcate that ll1o!-;t 
a th letes wi II be honest, even 
when tempted to be otherwise. 

The key work is "tempted." 
After all. temptation hali 
wrecked many families. 
marriages. and Jobs - not to 
mention tennis matches. 

WHAT'S THE 
DIFFERENCE? 
The difference: A Written 

Guarantee. We have student

Powers also stated during 
the inten'I('\\' that. "The one 
Ite plan IS t he cheapest 

solution ," b\ about one·anu-
to two million dollars. Pov"ers 
added that, "If it \\;as built on 
three sites instead of one, it 
would take about three to four

In a telephone interview la t 
Thursday, Watson said that

sound exotic and exciting. 

Mike Addl'ion, current 
Warren Provost and former 
chaIr of the drama depart -
ment. and several studentsare 
on thIS committee. Addison 
could not be reached in tIme 
for this article. 

However, Revelle Resident 
Dean Judith Edwi n said last 
T hur day, "It depends on how 

the input of a number of on-
campus committees were r 
considered, and that he and 
Vice Chancellor for Busine<; ' 
and Fmancial Affair. , H.D. 
Johnson have proposed for 
formal submis ion to the 
Regents a plan to build 225 
units north of Matthews and 
east of Central Library. 

Johnson, during a telephone 
interview last Friday, stated 
that the new debt service 
proposal has not reached his 
desk yet. "I have not receIved 
the committee's report. I 
understand that It is in the 
draft tage. " 

The committee is, according 
to Johnson, the resu lt of a 
Housing and Food Service 
committee recommendation 
made la t year to tudy debt 

they redist ribute it (the debt)." 
When a. ked to elaborate, 
Edwin said. "Because we have 
more common space (lounges, 
suite loungt' ..... the commuter 
lounge, and the Formal Infor-
mal Lounge). our rate ... would 
go up dIsproportIOnately," if 
the new debt service plan is 
the one she is most concerned 
about. 

Quotes from st udents at t he 

rall y varied. When asked \\ hy 
they were there. responses 
ranged from the laconic "For 
Re\cllt' apartments," to the 
hedonistic, "It's a mce sunny 
day," and "To pick up gIrl<;." 
Ho\Ve\er flippant some of the 
repl1es were, most of the 
students were theretodemand 
apart ments for Revelle . One of 
the more eloquent statements 
came from Dana Cromton , "I 
would like a partment on 

Revelle. I would not like to pay 
$500 for facilities £'m not 
allowed to usc."

terminated at an agreed,ujxm 
poi n t. where Watson and 
Atkinson accepted a letter and 
the petition . 

Atkinson said, in response 
to a question from one of the 
stu dents, that "This is a very 
complicated issue.. . It boi ls 
down to what can be sold to the 
Regents of the UniYersity of 
California." He also said that,

have only one of two choices.

meet the demonstrators to receive a petition with nearly 625 signatures protesting the one-
