Retracts Statement 
NEWARK, N.J. - President 
of Rutgers University Francis 
Lawrence was recorded as 
saying that some disadvan-
taged students do not have 
"that genetic hereditary 
background" to score well on 
standardized tests. After the 
publication of his comment in 
the Star l-eager of Newark, 
Lawrence released a statement 
which read, "The article 
interpreted me as meaning that 
genetic and hereditary factors 
somehow determine a person 's 
ability and achievement. That 
idea is precisely opposed to 
my beliefs." Lawrence added 
that, "What I intended to say 
was that standardized test 
should not be used to exclude 
disadvantaged students on the 
trumped-up grounds that such 
tests measure inherent ability, 
because I believe that they do 
not." 

Davis Rejects UCSA 
For a Second Time 
DAVIS - The Associated 
Students of UC Davis 
(ASUCD) voted by a five-to-
two margin not to rejoin the 
University of California 
Students Association (UCSA), 
which it withdrew from over a 
year ago. ASUCD External 
Affairs Commission Chairman 
Mark Stewart said that he felt 
that the UCSA should 
concentrate solely on student 
fee issues. " I have a strong 
disagreement with an organi-
zation involved with other 
issues." Davis originally 
withdrew from UCSA because 
of the Smith v. Regents 
decision, which effectively 
curbed UCSA's external 
lobbying activities.

Prompts Inquiry 
RISC: Guardian article sparks 
controversy over alcohol 
consumption during ski trip 
By Marianne Vletl 
News Editor 

A Guardian features article; which charac-
terized this year's Radically Inclined Ski Club 
(RISC) All-Cal ski trip as a "week of powder 
skiing and beer guzzling," has led UCSD admin-
istrators to investigate the university 's liability 
for student organization trips. 

"We have some concerns, but we're still 
looking into the situation," said Vice Chancellor 
of Student Affairs Joseph Watson. "We are 
deeply concerned with the health and welfare of 
our students and we want to ensure that the 
university is not associated with anything that 
compromises the health of our students, but we 
don't want to take any actions without being 
informed." 

"If the article is accurate then there is cer-
tainly some concern," he said, adding that it was 

obvious that alcohol use was the main issue in 
the controversy. 

The article, which was published on Mon-
day, provided a running narrative of the trip and 
included descriptions of drinking games and 
"dirty dancing" during the week. 

Former RISC President and current Assis-
tant Director of the All-Cal Shadi Almassizadeh 
said, "There isn't a problem. The administration 
doesn't have a problem with us. It was just the 
article's emphasis on the excessiveness of ev-
erything that has screwed us." 

Though the administration h'\S not specifi-
cally discussed the possibility of R1SC having to 
leave campus, Almassizadeh said he is worried. 
"I just wantto make sure that RISC is okay. I just 
don't know how the administration is going to 
react." 

A1massizadeh added that "Everyone knows 
that RISC is the social outlet for UCSD ... but no 
one wants to see that part of it. They [the admin-
istration] were just being tolerant of us."

Regents to 
Come to UCSD 
Amid Storm of 
Student Protest 
REGENTS: Regents' monthly 
meeting will be met with anti-
fee hike demonstrations 
By Jon"a Palmer 
News Editor 

The UC Board of Regents wi ll hold its 
monthly meeting at UCSD on Jan. 16 to discuss 
the 1995-96 UC budget, affirmative action and 
the new student regent. 

The meeting will open at 9:30 a.m. wi th 
public comments regarding the day 's agenda at 
the Price Center Ballroom. The board will then 
hear a report from the special committee to 
select a student regent, followed by comments 
on the budget and plans for discussion of affir-
mative action. 

In an effort to draw attention to fee increases, 
the A.S. will hold an all-night concert and build 
a "tent city" for the regents to see when they 
come to campus. 

The all-night anti-fee hike concert, "UCSD 
Unplugged," will mark the beginning of several 
activities which the A.S. and the University of 
California Students Association (UCSA) have 
planned to focus attention on the regents meet-
ing. 

According to A.S. Vice President External 
Naomi Falk, participants in the Wednesday 
night camp-out will spend the night on the Price 
Center lawn and listen to the student bands that 
have been scheduled to perform between 4 p.m. 
and 11 a.m. 

On Thursday, Falk said that organizers will 
hold a press conference during which they will 
present T-shirts from the "shirts off our backs" 
campaign to the regents. The shirts are being 
donated by students at each of the nine UC 
campuses to demonstrate their objection to ad-
ditional fee hikes. T-shirts will then be signed 
by students at the Price Center on Feb. 15, the 
day before the regents meeting. 

The second part of the press conference will 
be jointly held by the UCSA and university 
employee unions. Falk said that the regents are 
considering either denying faculty and staff 
salary increases or raising student fees to com-
pensate for the budget shortfall in Gov. Pete 
Wilson's proposed budget.

Ralph Nader Condemns Commercialized Culture in America 
LECTURE: Consumer 
advocate warns of 
corporate power 
By Tom Barkley 
Associate News Editor 

Painting a gloomy picture of the 
unseen manipulations big business 
exerts on the individual, consumer 
advocate Ralph Nader warned of 
the dangers of "growing up corpo-
rate," during his lecture last night 
for a near-capacity crowd at the Price 
Center Ballroom. 

Consumers who buy their food 

based on TV ads rather than nutri-
tional information, students who 
define their intelligence based on 
SAT scores, young kids who see a 
picture of George Washington and 
recognize him as the guy who sells 
cars on TV - all of these are prod-
ucts of a commercialized culture, 
according to Nader. 

"We grow up so corporate, we 
don't even think about how one-
sided it is," said Nader, comparing 
today 's commercial society to the 
drugged, contented "brave new 
world" in Aldous Huxley 's book.

CALPIRG Settles with Shell Oil Come Here for Beer! 
LAWSUIT: Shell must 
pay $2_2 million for 
environmental projects 
Terry Lew 
Guardian Reponer 

The California Student Public 
Interest Research Group 
(CALPIRG) announced Tuesday 
that its two-year-old lawsuit against 
Shell Oil Company for violating the 
Federal Clean Water Act has been 
settled. 

According to the terms of the 
consent decree signed by San Fran-
cisco Federal District Court Judge 
Thellon E. Henderson, Shell must 
reduce the amount of selenium re-
leased into San Francisco Bay from 
5.8 pounds-per-day to 2.13 pounds 
per day by July 31, 1998, or it will 
face steep penalties. 

Shell was found g~ilty of two 
violationsofthe Federal Clean Water 
Act. The first was the original 1991 
5.8 pounds-per-day standard and the 
second was the lower 2.13 pounds-
per-day standard. Shell paid the Re-
gional Water Quality Control Board 
$2 million in January of 1994 to 
delay enforcement oft he lower stan-
dard until July 31 , 1998. Shell's 
agreement would have allowed it to 
challenge any enforcement efforts 
after the deadline. Under the con-
sent decree, Shell cannot challenge 
the lower limit. 

"Over the next three or four years, 
this lawsuit successfully eliminates 
a ton of selenium that would have 
gone into the environment," said 

UCSD CALPIRG spoke.~man Eric 
Wesselman. 

Shell was unavailable for com-
ment. 

Selenium is a heavy metal by-
product of the oil-refining process 

, known to cause birth defects in ani-
mals and humans. According to sci-
entists it moves up the food chain by 
a process known as "biological mag-
nification," in which selenium-con-
taminated algae is eaten by fish, 
which are eaten by birds, and so on. 
The State of California recently is-
sued warnings against eating any 

restoration, or wetland restoration, 
or research" in determining who to 
fund. 

CALPIRG's action was one of 
~Iifomia's largest Clean Water Act 
lawsuits. "This settlement shows that 
citizens have the power to force 
huge corporations like Shell to re-
duce their pollution .... " said 
CALPIRG Program Director Mary 
Raftery. 

The Clean Water Act was one of 
the first environmental laws enacted 
after the formation of the Environ-
menml Protection Agency in 1970 

and has been re-form of aquatic life 
from the San Fran-
cisco Bay because 
of high contamina-
tion levels. 

In addition to re-
ducing its selenium 
output, Shell must 
pay $2.2 million to 
various organiza-
tions for projects 
"focused on protect-
ing and restoring the 
water quality and 
ecosystem of San 
Francisco Bay."

individual payments, which range 
from a $250,000 research grant to 
the University of California to 
$15,000 for the Coalition to Restore 
Urban Waters. 

According to Wesselman, 
CALPIRG "emphasized groups that 
were doing actual hands-on stream 

going into our 
water, or a very tiny amount," said 
Wesselman. 

However, federal mandates such 
as the Clean Water Act are coming 
under intense scrutiny in the new 
Congress, according to Wesselman.

Republicans' Wish Is 
Clinton's Command 

The Republican's Family Values Circus is in full swing. Last 
week, Republican leaders warned Clinton that his nomination of 
obstetrician/pediatrician Dr. Henry W. Foster, Jr. to the post of 
surgeon general was "in trouble" because the nominee had 
perfonned several abortions. This recent controversy raises an 
important question about theClinton administration: Will Clinton 
once again jump to please Republican leaders, abandoning the 
very people and ideals he pledged to support? 

The course Clinton should take is obvious: He sould blast 
Republicans for suggesting that performing abortions and par-
ticipating in Planned Parenthood minimizes Dr. Foster's 30 years 
of accomplishments. However, given Clinton's past record of 
gaffs in handling nomination problems, such a condemnation of 
Republican rhetoric is unlikely. 

Clinton proved that he lacked conviction when he fired Sur-
geon General Jocelyn Elders last December. It is ludicrous that 
anyone would reject Elders' proposal for improved sex education 
programs, which sought to include masturbation as a topic in the 
course, especially when teen pregnancy and AIDS are such 
pressing social problems. The fact that her plan was opposed by 
Republicans, and that Clinton supported this opposition, is telling 
of the president'S submission to the right. Clinton's uncanny 
ability to abandon members of his cabinet to please Republicans 
shows that the president finds it easier to be led than to stand up 
for his own ideals. Clinton should have borrowed some backbone 
from Elders, who didn't change her style or convictions in the 
face of tough opposition. 

Clinton's political weaknesses are borne in part from his 
party's wishy-washy ways. In early December of last year, the 
Democratic Leadership Party warned the president that he had to 
"move right, shake up his cabinet... and sign on to ... some of 
Gingrich's 'ContractwithAmerica. '" A Dec. 19, 1994Newsweek 
article enlitled, "Clinton's Values Blowout," depicted Clinton as 
a man who senses his own power is fleeting and is trembling at the 
doorstep of the new Republican House. Clinton's conciliatory 
State of the Union Address only emphasized how passive the 
president has become. 

Perhaps Clinton will realize that his inability to take astand has 
given way to the "revenge of the right." In the year which remains 
of his presidency, he will either prove himself to be a persuasive 
leader or a spineless follower. However, it is difficult to gain 
strength of character when one's beliefs ride solely on election 
results. 

Day's Ouster Is a Fitting 
End to Tumultuous Career 

The SDSU students ~ho painted a mural of their president, 
Thomas B. Day, with his head in a guillotine saw their dream 
become reality last Wednesday. Bowing to California State Uni-
versity Chancellor Barry Munitz, an embattled Day announced 
that his 17-year tenure, which has been marked by controversy 
since his appointment, would come to an end by July of next year. 
Munitz said that he believed that Day ' s abrasive leadership was no 
longer in the best interest of the San Diego's largest college. 

Day 's ouster is a fitting, if somewhat belated, conclusion to 
his career. While Day may have brought research money and a 
certain amount of prestige to the university, he was often remark-
ably oblivious to the needs of the SDSU community. During the 
1978 and 1992 budget crises, Day proposed, without flinching 
and certainly without much forethought, the wholesale trashing 
of entire academic departments. 1992 was the low point. Reacting 
to an anticipated eight-percent budget shortfall, Day sent out pink 
slips to 111 tenured professors and 35 probationary professors, 
and called for the disestablishment of nine academic depart-
ments. Not surprisingly, his decision sparked mass student pro-
test, and following a strong vote of "no confidence," a 486-370 
faculty vote for his removal. 

Understandably, Day's "retirement" has been received posi-
tivel y at SDSU. In this era of declining post -secondary access and 
quality, now more than ever, California's colleges need leader-
ship to guide them into the 21st century. Hopefully, that role will 
be ftlled at SDSU in 1996.

GLASS HOUSES AND 
CELEBRITY LoUSES 

COMMENTARY: The glossy pages of Architectural Digest 
.consist of far too enviable glamour and glitz 
By Jenny Unci 
Staff Writer 

The receipt of my issue of Architectural Digest is a 
monthly exercise in masochism, which I practice for 
what are no doubt unconscious and sick reasons. I get 
to look at rich people's amazingly cool homes, when 
my current aesthetic achievements are limited to pick-
ing up all the clothes off the chair in my bedroom. In 
A.D., I can admire Amalfi Coast villas with marble 
parquet and brass fixtures, when I can't even afford 
Pier 1.1 can look at ads for Tiffany, Cartier and Chanel, 
when my student budget doesn't even 
allow me the wild extravagance of 
shopping at Marshall's. By not restrict-
ing themselves to architectural design, 
marketing agencies can use ads for 
Swiss watches and high fashion to re-
mind us subscribers of ju'st how many 
ways we are inferior to those who oc-
cupy the world within A.D. 's glossy 
pages. 

It crumbs between her sofa cushions while watching 
mindless talk shows. (After seeing Reality Bites, this 
wasn ' t a difficult image to conjure up.) 

But alas, A.D. denied me any such satisfaction. It 
displayed Ryder perfectly coiffed and made-up, taste-
fully dressed and curled up on her flagstone hearth. 
Her airy, rambling house was decorated wilh fashion-
ably baltered antiques, interspersed with expensive 
fabrics and charming accessories. So, on top of all the 
other enviable things about her, now I know that she 
also has good taste. 

Perhaps its most effective sadistic 
tool is its frequent profiling of celeb-
rities. A.D. takes us to the level of ce-
lebrity hounding. Interviews featured 
in the National Enquirer, People and 
"l4lrd Copy" give us profiles of people 
whose lives are much juicier than our 
own. But as public as these interviews 
seem, there is still a large separation 
between reader and celebrity. 

Architectural Digest violates this 
separation. It actually talce you into me 
celebrities' homes. We can harbor no 
illusions about people once we have 
seen their Icitchens. For example, 
Winona Ryder was on the A.D. cover 
last summer. After seeing interviews 
about her in other publications, I'd al-
ready been enlightened to the fact that 

A.D. has similarly displayed 
Stephen Spielberg and Candice Bergen 
on its glistening pages. A.D. wasn't 
even satisfied to leave us reeling with 
pictures of Spielberg'S Los Angeles 
mansion; it had to really do us in with 
pictures of his other gorgeous home in 
New England. Needless to say, these 
people do not have old electric bills 
silting around their kitchens. They 
never have sticky rice-cooker pans 
soaking in the sink. That dog, which 
Bergen held in every photo, apparently 
never sheds. They also somehow man-
aged to avoid having their significant 
others' mountain bikes as a regular 
feature of their living room decor. 

Ayn Rand wrote in The Fountain-
head about a newspaper which pan-
dered to the public's desires, "it over-
stressed the glamour of society - and 
presented society news with a subtle 
sneer. This gave the man on the street 
two satisfactions: that of entering il -
lustrious drawing rooms and that of not 
wiping his feet on the threshold," 

I can look at 
ads for Tiffany, 
Cartier and 
Chanel, when 
my student 
budget doesn't 
even allow me 
the wild 
extravagance 
of shopping at 
Marshall's. 

Not so with A.D. Apart from being 
denied the satisfaction of sneering be-
cause I have no reason to do so, I am 

also enlightened to the fact that I should feel even more 
lowly than I did before. 

she was I} very cute, 2) rich and famous, 3) going out 
with rich, famous, cute guys and 4) younger than I 
am. This was more than I wanted to learn in the first 
place. 

Given this amount of information,l could still leave 
my subconscious to ponder the happy possibility that 
despite all these advantages in life, perhaps, like nor-
mal people, she went home to her messy, drab apart-
ment and slobbed around in sweats, dropping Cheez-

I have no choice but to cling to the notion that after 
the A.D. photographers called up Ryder and said they 
were on their way over, she leaped up from her crumb-
covered couch, ran out the door to the hair stylist and 
ordered the houselceeper to pick up all the pizza boxes 
and clothes draped all over the place. We cling to what-
ever we can.

COMMENTARY: Proposition 187 holds no legal force over the UC. The university community 
must stand against 187 and for academic freedom 

A CALL TO THE UC COMMUNITY 
By Ely Rebanl 
Special to the Guardian 

Though Proposition 187 is the 
subject of multiple legal challenges, 
Gov. Wiiso-n issued an executive 
order on Nov. 9, which directed the 
University of California to develop 
a policy to implement the measure. 
Not by error, but rather by construc-
tive assertion, Wilson ignores that 
Proposition 187 holds no legal force 
over the UC and that, as governor, 
he cannot compel the university to 
do anything. 

Both of these facts stem from 
what is known as autonomy. The 
UC Board of Regents is granted 
"full powers of organization and 
government" under Article IX, Sec-
tion 9 of the Califomia Constitution. 
Like several other public universi-
ties, the UC is given this degree of 
independence from state govern-
ment to insulate academic freedom 
from the vicissitudes of the politi-
cal fray. 

The university must adhere to the 
California Constitution, U.S. Con-
stitution and, though it doesn't like 
to admit it, federal statute. It isn't 
required to comply with California 
statute. It must, however, observe 

due process. 
Autonomy is why Gov. Reagan 

and much of the Legislature could 
not fire UCSD Professor Herbert 
Marcuse. Autonomy has made it 
quite difficult to sue the regents 
even for their more flagrant abuses. 
But autonomy is a central feature of 
the way the university operates. It 
would be the poorest of precedents 
to quietly and meekly permit the 
application of Proposition 187 to the 
university without any critical in-
quiry into these issues - by show-
ing autonomy ineffectual, it would 
be the derogation of any integrity 
presumed to uphold academic free-
dom. 

Though the text of Proposition 
187 attempts to affect all public 
post-secondary education in Cali-
fornia, as a statutory law it has no 
force over the UC. The UC is dis-
tinguished from all other state agen-
cies by this latitude. The Board of 
Trustees of the San Diego Commu-
nity College District, over which 
Proposition 187 does have legal 
force, has courageously denounced 
the measure and stated its intent to 
not implement it. Community col-
leges, in general, have been unre-

Should we wrap our 
Ivory tower with 
barbed wire, we 
would find either 
that academic 
freedom h.s little 
..... nlng or that the 
UC Is unworthy of N. 
ceptive to the measure. 

Because of UC autonomy, the 
regents need not exert th is degree 
of courage to refuse to enforce 
Proposition 187. But the question is 
whether they will show enough 
courage. The regents, in their wis-
dom, may elect to adopt some or all 
of Proposition l87, to modify it or 

to ignore it altogether. This is the 
first and most essential policy ques-
tion. The university community, as 
a whole, should involve itself in an-
swering this question, because it 
bears on the substance of academic 
freedom. 

We must recall that even at the 
height of the Cold War, academic 
freedom was political rivalry -
there were frequent academic ex-
changes and sharing of scientific 
data between the superpowers. 

Proposition 187 contravenes 
academic freedom by excluding a 
group of people from access to 
higher learning and everything 
which that access entails. Imple-
mentation of Proposition 187 by the 
UC would contradict academic free-
dom by effectively making the uni-
versity part of a surveillance appa-
ratus. 

Already, before any of Proposi-
tion 187 has become law, there have 
been instances of discrimination 
against citizens and legal residents. 
The statute has also had a chilling 
effect of scaring many people away 
from services for which they are eli-
gible. This should not be permitted 
to happen at the Uc. 

A stated motivation for Proposi-
tion 187 was the belief that the un-
documented were an unbearable 
burden on public services. In the 
case of the UC, there is no justifi-
cation for the claim that any of its 
significant fiscal difficulties may be 
attributed to undocumented stu-
dents. This is also true for the state 
as a whole, but reason did not pre-
vail on Nov. 8. What will prevail 
here? The difficulties faced by the 
university over the last four years, 
and expected in the future, result 
from insufficient state funding. 

The question is therefore 
whether we, the university commu-
nity, will allow cynical political 
blame games to erode the very core 
of academic freedom by sanction-
ing the persecution of those in our 
midst ana by locking many others 
out. 

Should we wrap our ivory tower 
with barbed wire, should the regents 
fail to show the minimal courage 
which they would need to stand 
against Proposition 187, we would 
find either that academic freedom 
has little meaning here or that the 
UC has demonstrated itself unwor-
thy of it.

Editor: 
I am responding to Peter Chang's 

commentary (" A Modest Proposal," 
Jan. 26). I understand Chang's con-
cern over the fai mess of affi rmative-
action quotas. I'm sure we have all 
heard about instances where these 
policies have turned into reverse 
discrimination in the UC system. 
However, this concern does not vali-
date Chang's poor analogy between 
social equality and the National 
Basketball Association (NBA). 

The racial composition of players 
in the NBA is based on genetic fac-
tors. No one discourages Asians from

To make a relevant analogy be-

tween society and the NBA, we need 
to take the racial majority during an 
NBA draft (black players) and put 
them up in suites at the Hilton, give 
them the best coaches and offer them 
seven-figure salary contracls before 
they try out. Then we take the racial 
minority (white players) and put 
them up at the YMCA, offer them 
five-figure salaries and instill in 
them the mentality that they will 
never make it in professional basket-
ball because white men are simply 
inferior to black men. Oh, of course

NADER: 
Continued from p ... 1 
"It's an all-encompassing situation. " 

Nader said that the commercial-
ization of an individual begins at a 
young age, as the child spends hours 
in front of the "cold tube" of the 
television, watfhing 20-second ads 
and images that change up to 50 
times per minnte. 

According to Nader, the child is 
not only deprived of intellectual 
stimulation or human interaction by 
watching television, but is also tar-
geted by corporations. In what he 
described as the "electronic subver-
sion of parental influence," compa-
nies use child psychology in their 
commercials, said Nader. "They 
conclude that the child feels forlorn, 
and the company product becomes a 
surrogate parent," he said . 

The process is perpetuated 
throughout one's education, accord-
ing to Nader, as students internalize 
the scores they receive on multiple 
choice tesls such as· the SAT as a 
measure of self-worth. Seeing them-
selves as being dumber or smarter 
than their peers, they will choose a 
career which the score indicates is 
"suited for them." 

"The product called 'mult.iple-
choice standardized test' measures 
intelligence chronologically," he 
added. "Yet, we all know that suc-
cess in life is due to a number of 
intellectual and personality trails that 
are never tested by thu;e multiple 
choicc tesls." 

The result of commercial social-
ization, said Nader, is a less demo-
crat ic and more com placent society, 
as citizens worry about their work 
life and disregard their "civil life" 
- their empowerment through po-
litical participation. 

"If the commercial value system 
dom inates over other val ue systems 
and runs them into the ground, we

did not sell the trip on the merit of 
alcohol. We sold it on the merit of a 
fun ski trip and as a chance to make 
friends." 

He added that RISC has many 
other activities during the year and 
that ~the All-Cal is the most ex-
treme thing we do." 

According to Berndes, he and 
several students will be meeting to-
day to discuss the university'S liabil-
ity. "Liability is absolutely the issue. 
We'll be asking the typical questions 
when you're dealing with alcohol: 
Who is checking the IDs, is the tour 
company liable for any injuries, was 
there underage drinking?" 

Berndes said that they would also

ness to our society that our more 
humane values are not going to have 
a chance to compete," Nader said. 

Nader has been fighting against 
corporate abuses for 30 years, since 
his expose on General Motors, Un-
safe at Any Speed, resulted in a 
recall of the Corvair. He said that 
the function of the consumer to cre-
ate a higher quality product through 
competition has been eclipsed by 
corporate dominance. 

"Any dominant system will abuse 
ils powers," he said, pointing to the 
public bailout of private business in 
the savings and loan fraud and of the 
Mexican government.

"Those need to be the absolute 
last options," said Falk. 

"They're making it an either/or 
situation. They ' re trying to pit fac-
ulty and staff against students," she 
added. 

According to Falk, the UCSA is 
attempting to persuade the regents 
to postpone their vote on fee in-
creases until they know how much 
state funding the UCS will receive 
when the Legislature passes a bud-
get laterthis year. She added thallhe 
UCSA will be coordinating speak-
ers lists for students who wish to 
voice their opinions during the pub-
lic comment period.

ing to dissolve that legislation," he 
said. 

"[CALPIRG' ] Clean Water 
Campaign is working to proteetleg-
islation, such as the Clean Water 
Act, that enables citizens to sue cor-
porate polluters like Shell Oil," 
added campaign coordinator Sara 
Camm. The campaign is organizing 
a campus-wide beach cleanup on 
Saturday, Feb. 18 and a "Toxies 
Tour," in whieh CALPIRG will re-
lease its list of the top 10 worst 
polluters in San Diego county. 

NADER: 
Continued from page 7 
think, reflect and collaborate with 
one another and build a democracy," 
he said. "We have to define the tools 
needed to develop the broad range 
of democratic powers wh ieh we have 
accommodation and respect for out-
side of the commercial system. If 
we don't do that, the world's re-
sources are at stake." Nader said 
that citizens should gain more con-
trol over public properties, such as 
the airwaves and land, which they 
rightfully own. 

Nader also warned of the "gee-
whiz-techno-twit" description ofthe 
information superhighway, "which 
is being controlled by the same mo-
nopoly types - TCI and Time-
Warner now control 40 percent of 
the cable households in the United 
States," he said. 

"They talk about the information 
superhighway, and most of us are 
shut out," Nader said. "One tool for 
consumers is that we've got to have 
our own media. We own the public 
airways - radio and TV stations 
get it free. They take our property 
and tell us who can say what on TV 
and radio, and shut us out from our 
own property. That is the most pow-
erfultenant I've ever seen." 

"We have all these channels. 
Where are the channels for citizen 
activity so we can learn from one 
another ... There 's 13.5 million stu-
dents in the United States going to 
college, they don't even have one 
half-hour TV show about what is 
going on campus in an exciting, 
intellectual and inventive way," he 
said. 

Nader said that keeping the cor-
poration in check is the responsibil-
ity of the citizen. "We all have to do 
our part spending time doing our 
civil duties," he said.

From Simpson 
to S~~pson 

Every now and then a great 
theory comes along that 
revolutionizes the way we, as 
human beings on this island 
planet, look at things. 

Tritons Collar Bulldogs, 76·66 
Einstein had his Theory of 

Relativity. Hawkings had his 
Grand Unified Theory. Newton 
had his Theory of Painful 
Apples. "Charles in Charge" 
had its Theory of Unlimited 
Syndication. 

And I - I have a new 
theory. It's an idea that will 
forever change the way you 
look at sports. It's Nobel Prize 
material, and, well, I suppose I 
can let you na'ive, worthless 
bugs in on my discovery. 

It all started - rather 
innocently - at a time when I 
was diligently ironing out the 
details of a David Hasselhoff-
O.J. Simpson conspiracy 
theory. 

FlVE-IN-A-ROW: UCSD 
earned yet another victory, 
this time over Redlands

rolling. Rolling, rolling, rolling, raw hide!

new generation of UCSD 
women 's basketball play-
ers . The Tritons (14-5) 
have been steadily rolling 
toward a playoff birth 
since losing to undefeated 
Cal Lutheran on Jan. 21. 
They have been on a five-
game winning streak since 
that defeat and their drive 
to make the playoffs has 
just about hit top speed. 

Hasselhoff was working on 
his season-opening "Bay-
watch" special, while Simpson 
was working on a new beach-
oriented action show. 

But, at exactly the same 
time that Hasselhoff's show 
was scheduled to air, the 
"Juice" began his now world-
famous, slowest car chase in 
history. It was an "escape" 
attempt which subsequently 
tied up every station from here 
to Boise, Idaho - where, 
incidentally, "Ba ywatch" 
garners the highest Neilsen 
ratings. 

YrIMN ZotoIJKfN/GlwriIWl 

Cindy Yamasaki w ... step ahead of the competition, aeon", 18 In UCSD's victory. 

UCSD's fifth consecutive triumph came 
at the expense of the Redlands Bu lldogs who, 
after pUlling up a terrific fight in the first half 
of the game, succumbed to the Tritons' de-
fensive pressure and went down in defeat, 
76-6fJ. 

See W. HOOPS, Page 13 

UCSD Stomps Rose Bowl Aquatics 

Coincidence? I think not. 
The car chase was obvi-

ously a last-ditch stunt to draw 
viewers' attention from 
"Baywatch." Clearly, the 
murder of Nicole Brown 
Simpson was arranged by O.J., 
but not for personal reasons. 
Nay, it was out of pure 
jealousy for David 
Hasselhoff's success. 

In fact, Hasselhoff's new "I 
Sing Sammy Davis, Jr." album 
was doing well, as was his 
show. And - here's the 
clincher - Hasselhoff has a 
full head of manly hair, while 
O.J. is balding faster than Ted 
Danson. 

It was at this point in my 
musings that I got the new idea 
for my gnnd theory. "Bald-
ness," ... ught. "How very 
interestingl" 

After aU, I had just 
witnessed a shaved Andre 
Agassi roll through the 
Australian Open. And that's 
when I really started getting 
carried away. 

READY: Triton men 
and women earn wins 
in tune-up for PCSCCS 
By Dan Kraft 
Sports Editor 

This weekend's pool action 
came courtesy of the swimming 
team which made a solo perfor-

mance without 
their high-flying 
counterparts from 
diving. The Tri-
tons hosted the 
Rose Bowl 
Aquatics Club at 
Canyonview on 
Saturday in what 
was their final 
tune-up for the 
Pacific Coast 
Swim Confer-

ence Championships which will be 
held Feb. 16-18 in Long Beach. 

UCSD looked ready to roar in 
the upcoming championships as it 
posted victories on both the men's 
and women's side with some much 
needed improvement from the men. 

freestyle' races. Hartsock, on the 
other hand, made his mark in the 
backstroke events, taking first place 
in the }OO- (56.74) and 200-yard 
(2:03.20) swims. 

"We swam okay," Head Coach 
Doug Boyd said. "We saw some 
improvement, but we've still got a 
ways to go. Hopefully we'll get it 
together before 
conference. " 

Meanwhile, 
UCSD's women 
continued to roll 
toward the confer-
ence champion-
ships with all the 
momentum of a 
run-away freight 
train. The Tritons 
downed the Rose 
Bowl Aquatics 
Qub by a IS point 
margin, 134-119, 
led by a superb per-
formance from 
Shawna Caballero. 
Among her other 
notable accom-
plishments was a 
first-place finish in 
the 200-yard 
freestyle (54.14) in 
which she cruised 
home a full three 

her nearest competition. 
"[Caballero J had a great meet," 

Boyd said. "She is going to surprise 
some people in NCAAs." 

The usual solid performers 
stepped to the fore, as the Tritons 
quickly turned an early deficit into 
victory. Christina Galdos dominated 
the competition en route to first-

place finishes in both the 100-
(1:01.46) and 200-yard (2:15.04) 
butterfly events. 

Teammate Dustin Matthew 
grabbed the top spot for UCSD in 
the 100-yard breaststroke (1:10.96) 
and the 2oo-IM (2:21.52) while 
Kristin Kemmer impressed her 
coach with a trio of solid swims. 

See THEORY, Page 13 

The Triton men came away with 
a comfortable 147-110 triumph. 
Among the standout performers on 
the men's side were Mike Jefferson 
and Stephen Hartsock. Jefferson 
stormed to first place finishes in the 
100- (48.18) and 200-yard (1 :48.07) seconds in front of ChrIsti ... GIIIdoa took flrst-place In the 100- and 200-yard butterfly eventl.

UCSD CLUB SPORTS ROUND-UP 
Cycling 

Mark Patterson/ GuarcJllII 
Mark Patterson (front) leada the pack In the UCSD Grand Prix. 

The big wheel keeps on rolling 
for the UCSD cycling team. 

Take last weekend's UCSD 
Grand Prix race, for 

• 

example. The Triton 
cyclists manhandled 
tough competition -
including UCLA, UC 

Santa Barbara, and Cal Poly S.L.O. 
- en route to winning both racing 
days outright. 

In Saturday's lengthy road races, 
UCSD's Adam Livingston led the 
way, grabbing second in the Men 's 
"A" Division with 34 points. Team-
mate Eric Stamber wasn't far be-
hind, taking fourth and 28 points. 

In the Men's "B" Division, Tri-
ton Mark Patterson snatched first 
place, while in Men's "C," Oliver 
Block took 11th place. Rounding out 
the men's scoring for UCSD was 
Paul Todd, who earned the gold in 

the Men's "D" Division. 
The Tritons' success poured over 

to the women's side, as standout 
Kate Elsley took fifth in Women's 
"A," followed closely by Karina 
Francis (sixth place) and Esther 
Davis (ninth place). 

In the Women's "B" Division, 
Bettina Wood dashed across the line 
in third place for the Triton cause. 

Sunda y 's short criterium races 
brought more of the same for 
VCSD. Ian Bettinger rode into 
fourth place in the" A" Division, 
with Stamber sprinted to 13th. 

Patterson was again dominating 
in the "B" criterium, racing to sec-
ond place, while Triton Dan Sawada 
captured first in the "C" Division. 

"We came out strong," Pallerson 
said. "I thought we did a great job 
working as a team."

Rugby 

The UCSD rugby team contin-
ued its strong season start by roll-
i ng over Claremont College, 26-10, 

last weekend. The 
Tritons traveled 
northward and 
completely 
outplayed their 

hosts - further improving their shot 
at a league title. 

UCSD's strong performance was 
a complete team effort, as all play-
ers contributed a key piece to the 
Tritons' final victory. UCSD was 
in control of the match from the 
start, never giving Claremont a 
chance to get in the game. 

"Our forward pack just domi-
nated Claremont's. We completely 

Men's Lacrosse 

It doesn't get any better than this 
for the UCSD men's lacrosse team. 

After grabbing first place at the 

., 
UCllnvite earlier in the 
year - against such 
rough- and-tum b Ie 
schools as SDSU and 
Chapman -the Triton 

stickers are up to their old tricks. 
In last Saturday's heated 

matchup against Division I power-
house UCLA, UCSD came on 
strong, pummeling the visiting Bru-
ins, 12-7. 

It was business as usual for a Tri-
ton squad that closed outlast year a 
close second in the Western Colle-
giate Conference, and is now seek-
ing the top spot this season. 

UCLA didn't roll over and die, 
however. The Bruins leaped out to 
a 3-1 lead in the first quarterofplay. 

"UCLA was fired up," captain 

CSD Sacks S.C. Conference 
OLUNG ALONG: The Triton squad has battled through a tough S.C. 

Fencing Conference schedule and emerged near the top at 5-1 
By Dan Kraft 
Sports Editor 

I n the rather obscure world of 
fe ncing, the West coast is not ex-
actly recognized as a hot-bed oftal-

ent. The UCSD 
fencing squad 
is slowly work-
ing to change 
this by making 
a name for it-
self on the 
West coast and 
beyond. Last 
year's AlI-
American per-

former Gabe Lawson, who turned 
some eyes toward the left coast, has 
continued to impress and prove that 
he belongs in the upper echelon. 
This year, he is not alone in his 
NCAA aspirations as a number of 
other Tritons have their sights set on 
joining him in the tournament. 

Yumi Nishiyama, who competes 
in the foil event, has amassed a 26-
3 record this season and is currently 
ranked among the top-three in the 
Southern California Fencing Con-
ference. She has an excellent shot 
at * conference title and at a chance 
to prove her mettle in the NCAAs. 

"I'm not looking as much at the 
conference championships as 
NCAAs," Nishiyama said. "NCAAs 
is the priority." 

Nishiyama has been one of the 
leaders of a Triton women's team 
that has marched to a 5-1 conference 
mark at the mid-point of the season. 

Among the other standouts for 
the women are Janet Wertz and 
Suzanne Walters who compete in 
the epee division. Wertz has tallied 
21 victories against only two defeats 
and is ranked in the top-five in the 
conference. Walters, also in the top-
five, has been consistently racking 
up the wins and is now 20-3 against 
conference opponents. 

"I think [Nishiyama) will be a 
conference champion," Head Coach 
Lisa Posthumus said. "I hope 
[Wertz and Walters) can be confer-
ence champions as well." 

outplayed them," Triton coach 
Eric Takeuchi said. "It was a real 
good win for us." 

UCSD's Joe Lang led the 
team's offensive output, exploit-
ing the Claremont defense and 
scoring two tries. Veterans Ryan 
Kent and Derek Jaroncyzk put 
the game out of reach for the 
confident Tritons, each also scor-
ing a try. 

Team captain Devon Shea put 
the icing on the cake, convert-
ing on three offour extra points, 
finishing off the scoring for the 
Tritons and sealing the victory. 

With an easy road win against 
Claremont under their belts, the 
Tritons (2-0) will look to extend 

Brad Cook said. "We rode out 
their opening wave." 

During the remaining quar-
ters, a triumvirate of talent led a 
powerful UCSD offensive surge. 
Dave Pakter, Brent Hilsabeck 
and Ben Stewart each tossed in 
three scores for the Tritons, 
while Pakter tallied three assists. 

UCSD's James 
Kappler also proved 
effective, notching 
two goals and one 
assist. Teammate 
Dave Misfield 
added a score as 
well, while Dave 
Pogrel and Jeff 
Lamkin aided the 
Triton attack. 

Goalie Shen 
Owyang and the sti-
fl ing Tri ton defense 

their winning streak to three in-a-
row. 

They continue to surprise the 
Goliaths in their division by hang-
ing around at the top of the league 
standings. 

UCSD now heads into the thick 
of their schedule, with upcoming 
matches against the top teams in the 
league. Many Triton players feel 
their strong start will only be taken 
seriously if they can win a couple 
of the big games. 

UCSD will attempt to continue 
their unbeaten season next Saturday 
with a home match at 3 p.m. at War-
ren West Field against Cal State 
Bakersfield.

decimated the Bruins' hopes, seal-
ing the win for UCSD. 

The Tritons' will try to continue 
their winning ways versus San Di-
ego State on Feb. 15. The game be-
gins at 6 p.m., and it is their first 
contest "under the lights" at 
Thurgood Marshall's North Field. 

- By Tedd Ladd 

On the men's side, Lawson is the 
undeniable leader having posted an 
unblemished 24-0 record in the con-
ference that ranks him number-one 
in the foil and puts him in terrific 
position to travel to NCAAs and de-
fend his All -American title.

wson (rllllt) has posted a 24-0 mark In conference play. 

The men are 5-1 overall in 
league competition led by their foil 
and epee squads each of which have 
posted 4-2 marks. The men who 
compete in the sabre discipline have 
split their six contests in league, 

going 3-3 thus far. 
Ahead for the Tritons will be 

rematches against the teams in their 
league including UCLA, USC, and 
UCSB. UCSD will hope to repeat 
the success it enjoyed in the first 
half of its season and roll into the 
conference championships on a 

high-note. 
"I'm happy because they're so 

new," Posthumus said. "We have 
athletes who have been fencing any-
where from three months to three 
years and some even more. But, 
what we lack in technique, we make 
up for in desire." 

Thursday, February 9, 1995 The UCSD Guardian 

ranged from 15 points to as few as 
five points, but the Tritons never re-
linquished it, holding off numerous 
charges from the Bulldogs' frus-
trated offense with solid outside 
shooting. 

Cindy Yamasaki racked up 18 
points in the contest to lead the Tri-
tons' offensive efforts. She was sup-
ported by Jenessa Bayda who scored 
all of her 12 points from beyond the 
three-point arc where she was a 
near-perfect four-for-five on tbe 
evening. 

"[Yamasaki and Bayda) had a 
great game," Malone said. "The 
outside shooting really came 
through for us. We've got a lot of 
weapons." 

With just under three minutes to 
play in the contest, Redlands had 
already resorted to fouling the Tri-
tons who were comfortably in com-
mand with a IS-point edge. The 
Bulldogs' efforts paid off in part as 
they hit a late three-pointer and 
closed the gap to ten, but it was too 
little too late as UCSD marched 
away with the victory.

THEORY: Bald 
Is Beautiful? 
Continued from pille 9 

You see, contrary to that sappy 
Sampson and Delila tale in which 
the crafty wench chops off all of the 
fella's dreds, hair is obviously nor a 
source of strength - especially in 
sports. 

Take, for example, Michael Jor-
dan. None of his championship 
rings were accumulated with a full 

God dellgbts in those who IIeep 
their promises. -""""'~ 

.d-ver-tis-inK n 1: the 
action of calling something 
to the attention of the public, 
esp. in the UCSD Guardian 
newspaper, 534-3466 

thanks in large part to the efforts of 
their inside work horses who com-
bined for 44 points and 18 rebounds. 

UCSD made some adjustments 
at halftime and continued to plug 
away, and the changes paid off as 
the Tritons came storming back to 
grab the lead which they held for 
the majority of the second half. 

"We went to a zone defense and 
took away their inside game," 
Malone said. "We made them shoot 
outside, and they stopped hitting." 

UCSD 's second-half leads 

hairdo. The same goes for USA 
Volleyball standout Bob Samuelson; 
as soon as the team shaved their 
heads in his honor, the team went 
on a tear. 

And what about baseball's Will 
Clark? He's like fine wine. He keeps 
getting balder and better with age. 
Or Portland's Terry Porter? Or the 
Lakers' Nick Van Exel? Heck, even 
Terry Bradshaw is now a much 
more entertai'ping person, since he's 
devoid of cranial foil ic1es. 

That Sampson story has it all 

The Tritons hope to continue 
rolling toward the playoffs when 
they face off against La Verne to-
morrow night. The Leopards sent 
VCSD down in defeat when they 
played in RIMAC, and the Tritons 
are out for revenge as they attempt 
to shut down La Verne's hard-nosed 
Division 11 transfer star, Leslee 
Rogers who lit up UCSD for 26 
points in the last meeting. 

"We're really going to get after 
her," Malone said. "This is going to 
be a tough win to get." 

wrong. If you shave your head, you 
can't help but be a better person. It 's 
really that simple. 

So the next time you see a bald-
ing sport hero sink the winning bas-
ket, tap in the final pull, or catch the 
last-second pass, just remember: I 
told you so. 

That's my theory. Now, if I can 
just come up with a name. The Bald

Shakespeare abounds 
upon 8an Die80 sts8es 

I f I didn ' t know better, I'd swear that the Old Globe and San Diego Reper-
tory were producing their respective 

versions of "Much Ado About Nothing" 
and "Hamlet" in tandem. The two con-
trast beautifully and are both entirely 
enjoyable. "Much Ado" presents chann-
ing romantic comedy with subtle shad-
ows of darker themes, while "Hamlet" 
provides heart-wrenching tragedy as well 
as light-hearted moments, 

Director Jack O'Brien's "Much Ado" 
is set in 19th-century Spain, a setting 
reminiscent of present-day San Diego, 
Two flamenco guitarist s and Latin 
Balthazar (Maurice Mendoza) play a 
score that complemenls the siesta atmo-
sphere on stage. Their lullabies some-
times hint at tragedy, other times at youth-
ful love and courting. Such tunes rouse 
the players into witty verse (compliments 
of Shakespeare) and hilarious stage an-
tics (thanks to O 'Brien),

"DeathandtheMaiden,"anaward-
winning play by Chilean writer Ariel 
Dorfman, has been performed in over 
3Ocountries. Most recently, fil mmaker 
Roman Polanski has offered 
his interpretation of the popu-
lar play. 

Set in an unspecified Latin 
American country during the 
rail of a dictatorship, Death

Paulina &cobar (Sigoumey

Richard Easton as Benedick and 
Katherine McGrath as Beatrice shine. 
Though these witty lovers are usually 
cast as young and care-free, !hese two 
actors' seasoned age works wonder-
fully. They're too old for love at first 
sight, too careful for unguarded gawk-
ing and simpering, but young enough 
tofall preytoCupid'sarrows. They've 
been tricked by love, but its potent 
medicine rejuvenates each of them. 
Benedick says farewell to his more 
cowardly days and gives valiance and 
honor a shot, while Beatrice lowers 
her defenses and learns to smile. 

The love between Benedick and 
Beatrice, as well as its portrayal by 
Easton and McGrath, highlights the 
meager love of their youthful coun-
terparts, Claudio and Hero, played by 
Jonathan Walker and Nike Doukas. 

Unfortunately,Jonathan Walker's 
acting is as shallow as his character.

The Return 
of the Hurdy

Sixties singer 
Donovan 
rev~ves career 

By JeffNlesel 
Hiatus Editor 

P.ull ... ($ipurney WHv.r) ruche. for a IIIn In Roman PoI .... kI'. o..th MId 
film based on Ariel Dorfman'. play. 

Since aging rockers such as . 
Johnny Cash, Tom Jones and Tony 
Bennett are making comebacks 
and appealing to young listeners, 
it only makes sense that Donovan, 
who turns 49 on Tuesday, would 
stage a similar return . The 
Glasgow-bomsinger, whosepopu-
larity reached its height in the late 
'60s, showed that he has the po-
tential to reach a new audience 
when he performed two weeks 
ago at Lunapark in West Holly-
wood. The concert was the second 
of four sold-out shows held on 
consecutive Thursdays at the 
venue. 

Miranda (Ben Kingsley) by claiming 
that he held her prisoner 15 years 

earlier. 
Like his classic psy-

chological thrillers Re-
pulsion and Rosemary's 
Baby, Polanski follows 
the obsessions of a fe-
male character. In 
Maiden, Paulina suffers 
from a series of flash-

egy, he is stiff and emotionless. 
Doukas' performance is somewhat 
better than Walker's, since Hero is a 
more developed character. 

Hero is nearly done in by Don 
Sparks' bumbling Don John, a most 
successful comic villain. More harm-
ful to his lecherous cronies than his 
enemies, he has particular trouble 
avoiding an ill-fated potted plant. The 
audience finds his folly irrestible, 
though Benedick is the crown favor-
ite hands down. 

But Shakespeare won't allow all 
villainy to be discarded. O'Brien lays 
the blame on the church for Hero's 
near-demise. Hero's sin - Claudio 
thought he saw her engaging in an 
unchaste romp - turns out to be 
nothing: the very nothing of the play's 
title, in fact. When her innocence is 
revealed, all is well once again. 

The lovers wed, chaste as can be, 
and Balthazar sings the last song in 
Spanish. As the villa returns to its 
siesta, even Don John is forgiven and 
invited to dance. But this time, he 
doesn't break the pot into bits. 

Todd Salovey's "Hamlet" at the 
Lyceum in Horton Plaza depicts a 
modem-day state in the last days be-
fore its collapse. The characters in 

backs that recall her captivity and 
the physical and mental abuse she 
and other women suffered under the 
dictatorship. Paulina specifically re-
members the game of "death and the 
maiden," in which she was tortured 
while classical music played in the 
background. 

It's unclear whether Miranda is 
really the one responsible for tortur-
ing Paulina. When Miranda unknow-

ingly helps Paulina's husband (Stuart 
Wilson) fix a flat tire, he accompanies 
him home, only to be tied to a chair by 
Paulina, who tries to force a confes-
sion from him. At this point the film's 
poi nt is lucid, showi ng that innocence 
and guilt are not objective categories 
but are determined by who has the 
most power.

Donovan tried out some new 
tracks he has been working on 
with producer Rick Rubin, who 
has recently produced with Tom 
Petty, Slayer and Johnny Cash. 

Pigeonholed a "flower child" 
during the '60s, Donovan's folk 
songs were often compared to Bob 
Dylan's. Unlike Dylan, however, 
Donovan works from a European 
minstrel tradition. His first single, 
"Catch the Wind" (1965), showed 
he had the potential to be a great 
singer. Donovan's traditional ro-
mantic sensibility and interest in 
Eastern religions may seem like 
anachronisms, but the singer also 
has a somber, maudlin side. 

Known for putti ng famous po-
ems to lyrics, Donovan performed 
a version of Edgar Allan Poe's" EI 
Dorado" that was downright 
creepy. Able to sound giddy in 
"Jennifer Juniper" or serious in 
"Josie," the range of emotions 
Donovan displayed was impres. 
sive. Donovan hasn 't lost his 
flower power: It's only a matter of 
time before the rest of the world 
realizes he is about to blossom 
once more.

Bettie Serveert 
Lamprey 

Bettie Serveert, an Indie-rock:,and 
from Amsterdam. will not disappoint 
fans or fi rst-time listeners with its new 
album, Lamprey. The unique blend of 
singer Carol Van Dijk'sstrong, sweet 
vocals, with hard. grunge-like 
instrumentals creates an unclass-
ifiable, appealing sound. 

While Van Dijk's melodic. heart-
felt lyrics reflect the essence of the 
band's sunny soul, guitarist Peter 
Vissar's alternation from light acous-
tics to moaning amplification adds 
depth and passion to the work. Vissar 
and bassist Herman Bunshkoekeman-
age to integrate perfectly without 
drowning out the vocals. 

Van Dijk, who is part Canadian, 
sings about modern life from a 
thoughtful and honest per-
spective. Although her Iyr- . 
ics feel upbeat, she is not a 
polyanna. "D. Feathers" is 
about the struggles of an 
individual coming to terms 
with the basic insecurity of 
physical existence: "I can't 
trust in what I see/ I can 
only trust in me/lfthewhole 
world should drop dead/ I'd build my 
own inside my head." 

Van Dijk shows the advantages of 
being a smart, independent woman, 
despite societal limitations. In "Some-

thing So Wild," she explores, with 
refreshing insight, the complexity of 
love relationships, from a female per-
spective: "And I try to convince her to 
make it on herown/She'safraid to be 
a spinster/ she's afraid to be alone." 

Bettie Serveert has been together 
since 1991 , when drummer Berend 
Dubhe came up with the name from a 
biography of the Dutch tennis star, 

Bettie Stoves, which in-
cluded a picture of her cap-
tioned, "Betty serves." 
Hence the name. Since then 
it has released the single 
"Tomboy" and the album 
Paiomine. 

Lamprey, while retain-
ing the quality of earlier re-
leases, gets into new terri-

tory, "Re-feel-it," for example, opens 
with a cacophony of banging on metal

Margaret Cho 
Comedian challenges her critics 

By Chl&-Un Simmon. 
Staff Writer 

Margaret Cho, an up and coming 
Korean-American comedian from the 
Bay Area, is known for her caustic 
humor. Yet, Cho, who will perform 
tomorrow at Mandeville Auditorium, 
was mellow and serious during a re-
cent phone interview. When asked 
how much of the "Valley Girl" per-
sona from her prime-time television 
show " All-American Girl" was the 
"real her," she reflected, "I think very 
little now, I've really, really grown-
up a lot." 

Cho's toned-down image is per-
haps a result of her newfound success 
and the criticism she received for her 
portrayal of Asian-Americans in " Al] 
American Girl." Writing in the New 
York Times Magazine John H. Lee 
criticized Cho 's program for its 
"butchered Korean language and

Korean American as the dry, puff-job 
thing the prop people tried to pass off 
as pap .... " 

Coo responded tosomeofthecriti-
cism she's received about the show's 
more stereotypical elements, saying, 
"Since nobody 's ever really done this 

. before, I don't really understand the 
ideathatthere'sstereotyping .... lOOn't 
believe that this stereotyping occurs 
within the show. I believe that it oc-
curs within the point of the viewer." 

Saddled with the burden of being 
the first Asian-Asian actor with a 
prime-time show, Cho is bearing it 
with a grimace. The focus on repre-
sentation and racial politics, rather 
than on work and artists, has made her 
bitter about the way she has been 
portrayed by the media. 

"I think there is a lot of responsi-
bility," Cho said of her role. "It's 

really important to support other art-
ists in the future on that basis, you 
know by their work and by their ex-
pertise [ratherthan] beingj ust a proper 
representation, becciuse then, art is 
lost in the expression. Everything is 
lost ... and I think 1 have been dam-
aged beyond repair and I'm never 
coming back to it. I mean, I've .Iost 
already. But in the future I would 
recommend that we treat other artists 
with a little bit more of an idea of what 
art is as opposed to what politics [is)." 

Nevertheless, Cho has been active 
in projects such as Hoo's animation 
program "Happily Ever After: Fairy 
Tales for Every Child, "with the voices 
of Whoopi Goldberg, Denzel Wash-
ingtonand Rosie Perez. "Happily Ever 
After" is Ii series of ethnically diverse 
fairy tales in which Cho is the voice of 
Queen Uh-Muh-Ni in the Asian ver-
sion of "The Princess and The Pea."
