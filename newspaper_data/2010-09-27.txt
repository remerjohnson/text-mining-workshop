Supporters of the California D.R.E.A.M. Act  
which would allow illegal immigrants to receive 
financial aid from public universities and colleges  
are pushing for its approval despite the Sept. 2 failure 
of a federal version of the bill.

The federal D.R.E.A.M. Act would grant undocu-
mented immigrants a pathway to permanent resi-
dency, as well as citizenship upon the completion of 
military service or college. 

This version failed in Congress, but similar bills 
in California  SB1460 and AB1413, collectively 
known as the California D.R.E.A.M. Act 2010  
have been approved by California Senate and await 
approval from Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger.

Like previous attempts to provide financial aid 
for undocumented immigrants, SB1460 and AB1413 
build on the earlier California D.R.E.A.M. Act 2001. 
The 2001 version granted in-state tuition status, but 
not financial aid. 

Under the 2010 version, anyone who has gradu-
ated from a California high school after attending for 
at least three years qualifies for resident tuition and 
financial aid from California public universities and 
community colleges, regardless of legal status.

Tuition at California public universities  includ-
ing the University of California  has risen in past 

After the federal version failed to 
pass, Californians push for the state 
version to gain governors approval.

A.S. Councils plans for an on-campus 
store selling Sun God and Greek mer-
chandise have been pushed back to Winter 
Quarter due to planning difficulties.

Turning the vision of the store, Triton 
Outfitters, into a reality was set in motion 
by former All-Campus Senator Tobias 
Haglund, and projected to debut in January 
2010, but was pushed back until it was rati-

fied unanimously to continue for this year 
at the last A.S. meeting of the year.  

The A.S. Council expected to have 
all of the necessary details ironed out by 

the end of summer, but it 
will now take the rest of 
Fall Quarter to reach com-
pletion because planning 
and implementing did not 
occur as quickly as pre-
sumed.

The store, named Triton 
Outfitters, will sell the merchandise  
such as T-shirts, Greek apparel and letters 
 of any student-registered organization, 
as well as promotional products like mugs, 
lanyards and hoodies. 

Council plans for Triton Outfitters to 

be open year-round and occupy the space 
in the west wing of the second floor of 
University Centers, which housed the Sun 
God store this past May.

Brian McEuen, Associate Vice 
President of Enterprise Operations, said 
the store will offer an alternative to the 
UCSD Bookstore, which currently sells 
only UCSD-branded merchandise. 

However, he aid that key factors  such 
as the percentage of profit Triton Outfitters 
will retain, or how to manage all the dif-
ferent organizations  have not yet been 
determined.

In addition, no floor plan has been final-
ized. Several designs discussed with Vice

I n an effort to create a campus climate of cultural tolerance, the UCSD administration, including the Offices of the Chancellor and the Vice Chancellor-
Student Affairs, is spearheading a systemwide attempt 
to raise awareness on the importance of diversity. This 
effort is in response to the racially charged events that 
occurred last academic year.

Throughout California, UC campuses are estab-
lishing committees focusing on the state of commu-
nity and racial climate in the university. 

Here in La Jolla, the newly-formed UCSD 
Council on Climate, Equity and Inclusion met for 
the first time over the summer on July 22, 2010.

The council was created by university admin-

istrators with several goals in mind. One primary 
responsibility of the council is to provide a clear 
assessment of a campus climate that is inclusive of 
diversity. 

Having done that  and identified areas in 
which the school needs to improve  the council 
will evaluate the research, theories and practices 
published by experts on campus communities. It will 
also  implement those findings in order to safeguard 
all members of the UCSD community.

Another group with a similar focus is the UCSD 
Alumni Associations Diversity and Outreach 
Committee, which recently held its second annual 
meeting. The committee hopes to increase the 
alumni role in improving UCSDs campus climate

INTERGALACTIC ASTRAL CAT By Philip Rhie

RIGHT ON TIME By Isabella Verdendia

VirtualÊRealityÊDeviceÊLetÊUsersÊSeeÊandÊFeelÊ3-DÊImages

By Matthew Stewart
Contributing Writer

Ever since “Avatar” came out 
in 3-D, the third dimension has 
been staging a full-scale inva-
sion. Not only has the blockbuster 
achieved massive success, but shows 
like “Arrested Development” have 
recently advised viewers to grab the 
nearest set of 3-D glasses. 

But making us flinch at the sight 
of a thrown tomato may not be the 
end of 3-D’s bag of tricks. Thanks to 
scientists at the California Institute 
for Telecommunications and 
Information Technology, those 3-D 
images may soon be close enough 
to touch.

The Heads-Up Virtual Reality 
device, or HUVR (pronounced 
“hover”), is at the forefront of aug-
mented reality technology, allowing 
users to physically interact with vir-
tual environments.

HUVR is similar to phone appli-
cations like Layar, which allow users 
to point a phone camera at objects 

and have information about those 
objects displayed on the screen. 
These claim to be augmented real-
ity, but HUVR’s Design Engineer 
Greg Dawe claims there is a key 
difference.

“Without touch feedback, it’s not 
augmented reality, it’s just regular 
reality with pictures overlaid on it,” 
Dawe said.

With HUVR, the user sits at a 
desk with a semi-transparent mirror 
in front of them, resting at an angle. 
The user, through special glasses, 
can view a 3-D image shown on the 
mirror. Beneath the mirror is a con-
troller that the user grips and can 
move around in three dimensions.

When the controller, which is 
beneath the mirror where the user 
sees the image, crosses into  the 
image that the user sees, motors 
provide resistance on the controller, 
mimicking the feel of whatever the 
image is showing. 

This allows the user to “feel” 
the image as though it were a real 
object. In one simulation, a 3-D 

image of a rib cage is shown and the 
controller moves smoothly around 
the 3-D ribs.

There are certain visual cues that 
the brain picks up on when viewing 
a virtual reality image, cluing the 
user into the fact that the image 
isn’t real. 

But the HUVR team found that 
something unexpected happens 
when people take orders from the 
program: They have no problem 
accepting the computer’s version of 
reality.

“When you have an avatar issu-
ing commands to the user, they 
immediately suspend disbelief,” 
Dawe said.

Integrating the touch interaction 
— also known as haptics — into the 
user experience creates the same 
effect. The controller is telling the 
user what is there and how it feels, 
which allows the user to become 
immersed in the activity.

In addition to the haptic inter-
face, the 3-D system is able to track 
the movements of the user’s head 

and adjust the image for the user’s 
point of view.

“We don’t just look at objects, we 
can look around them, too,” Dawe 
said.

In order for an image to seem 
real, it needs to adjust its position 
for the little movements of the eyes 
and head and the changes in rota-
tion and perspective. 

The cheapest way to do this is 
using a computer-controlled infra-

years. If the California D.R.E.A.M. Act 2010 
passes, approximately 605 additional under-
graduates will qualify for $1.8 million in 
financial aid.

The California D.R.E.A.M. Act 2010 may, 
however, meet the same fate as its federal 
cousin. In 2007, Governor Schwarzenegger 
vetoed a previous version of the D.R.E.A.M. 
Act, citing the state’s financial difficulties.

“I share the author’s goal of making afford-
able education available to all California stu-
dents,” Schwarzenegger said in a statement, 
“but given the precarious fiscal condition the 
state faces at this time, it would not be prudent 
to place additional demands on 
our limited financial aid resources 
as specified in this bill.”

Representatives from the UC 
Office of the President have voiced 
their support for the bill in spite 
of the promise of added financial 
burden.  

UCOP representative 
Karen French wrote a letter to 
Schwarzenegger’s office on behalf 
of the office, offering support for 
SB1460 and requesting that the 
governor sign the bill.

“SB1460 addresses the remain-
ing hurdle for [undocumented] 
students: their inability to receive 
institutional aid,” French wrote. 
“Through their hard work and 
perseverance, these students have 
earned the opportunity to attend 
a UC. Their accomplishments 
should not be disregarded or their future 
jeopardized because of their legal status.”

Similarly, after the federal D.R.E.A.M. 
Act failed earlier this month Senator Gilbert 
Cedillo — author of the California D.R.E.A.M. 
Act and its predecessors — expressed his dis-
appointment with Congress in a press release 
posted on his website: “The U.S. Senate has 
lost the opportunity to advance the future of 
thousands of young talented students and our 
economy. We have duties and obligations to 
move young talent forward in our state and 
support them with equal education oppor-
tunities.”

A.S. Vice President of External Affairs 
Michael Lam said he is working with UC 
student leaders to promoting the legislation

“This year [we will be working] with 
University of California Student Association 
to launch a campaign titled Economic Justice 
for the UC [which in part] will be to ensure 
that all students, no matter their documenta-
tion status, have a right to afford higher edu-
cation,” he said.

UCSA is a coalition of UC students dedi-
cated to increasing the accessibility of the UC 
system. 

However, critics of the bill, such as Dan 

Stein, President of Federation for American 
Immigration Reform, called the bill for being 
reckless and irresponsible in an interview 
with PR Newswire.

“The California legislature continues to 
demonstrate its contempt for law-abiding, 
taxpaying Californians,” he said. “As they put 
the final touches on a budget that cuts vital 
services and programs, illegal aliens get new 
rewards.” 

Republican gubernatorial nominee Meg 
Whitman has expressed similar views on her 
policy page: “Meg is opposed to any form 
of amnesty. As Governor, Meg will support 
policies that will not allow undocumented 

immigrants admission to state-
funded institutions of higher 
education.”

Although support for the 
bill is not universal, D.R.E.A.M. 
Act supporters say it is vital for 
it to be passed.

“The Dream Act [provides] 
the opportunity for all students 
[to access] affordable higher 
education.” Lam said. “People 
will always have opinions, but 
as the External Affairs office, 
we support the D.R.E.A.M. Act. 
We will continue to work hard 
to get the bill passed.”

Warren College senior and 
undocumented immigrant 
John Erickson*, who wished 
to remain anonymous, said he 
believes that the D.R.E.A.M. 
Act is an issue that will continue 

until the legislation is passed.
“We are frustrated that the federal bill did 

not pass, but now our energies are redirected 
towards the California one,” he said. “This is 
an issue that will not go away. It might not 
happen right, now but it will win.”

Though Schwarzenegger vetoed the bill, 
Erickson said he is optimistic that the gov-
ernor’s views may change, or that a successor 
will be more sympathetic to the issue.

“Historically, it may not seem like there 
is much of a chance, but we can see that 
[Schwarzenegger’s ] stance towards higher 
education is shifting,” Erickson said. “With 
the momentum built from [the March 4 Day 
of Action] and the 32-percent fee increases 
— in addition to the fact that he is leaving — 
we’re hoping for the best.”

Even if Schwarzenegger signs the 
California D.R.E.A.M. Act 2010 before its 
Sept. 30 deadline, the effects will be largely 
nullified without the passage of a federal 
D.R.E.A.M. Act. 

Without the federal bill, undocument-
ed immigrants who have received college 
degrees will still be unable to legal their status

for minority students. 
Members discussed proposed funding 

increases for student scholarships, which 
would increase access for students from dis-
advantaged economic backgrounds, and for 
programs such as the Office of Academic 
Support and Instructional Services that reach 
out and recruit those students.

When the search for new faculty began for 
this academic year, 12 faculty positions out 
of 33 were designated for focusing on diver-
sity and establishing an inclusive climate at 
UCSD. This is twice as many as the original 
six positions demanded by the Black Student 
Union last year

“UC San Diego is deeply committed to 
making positive changes to improve the cam-
pus climate and broaden the richness and 
diversity of its community and curriculum,” 
Senior Vice Chancellor of Academic Affairs 
Paul Drake said in a e-mail.

Scripps Institution of Oceanography is 
also participating in efforts to create a diverse 
environment at UCSD by trying to increased 
the number of  underrepresented students 
in the science community. Through UCSD 
Academic Connections, 20 students and four 
teachers from Compton High School partici-
pated in a Scripps summer program, touring 
the facilities and labs and getting an inside 
perspective on Scripps’ research.

Student organizations such as the BSU 
and the A.S. Council have also been working 
collaborating to foster a campus culture of 

inclusion. 
According to Alyssa Peace, Associate Vice 

President of Diversity Affairs, the univer-
sity began building resources centers for 
many minority organizations and groups in 
response to the BSU’s list of demands.

Additionally, council planned events, 
such as Triton Voices organized by the 
Student Affairs office which took place last 
Monday in Price Center, targeting freshmen. 
It featured multi-media presentations and 
testimonials and personal stories of students 
experiences with diversity at UCSD.

“It’s a priority to engage incoming fresh-
men with diversity efforts at UCSD,” Peace 
said.

Although the council is not direct-
ly involved with working with the list of 
demands the BSU presented last year, Peace 
said that the UCSD administration has made 
headway on a majority of them, such as the 
creation of the African–American Student 
Resource Center.

The diversity initiatives have spread across 
other aspects of UCSD’s campus and student 
life. The administration has, in partnership with 
the BSU, commissioned murals with themes 
that advocate diversity, as well as advocating the 
creation of  a Chicano/a and Latino/a Studies 
minor and gathering faculty support. 

There is also an effort to increase the vis-
ibility of minority artists, including art that 
represents African American, Latino/a, and

8 THE UCSD GUARDIANÊ MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 27, 2010Ê NEWS

President of Finance and Resources 
Andrew Ang and former A.S. presi-
dent Utsav Gupta have been pro-
posed but none have been selected 
because the university has not yet 
agreed to an A.S. Council-approved 
contract with designers to construct 
in the space. The cost of designs 
and contractors has not been deter-
mined.

In addition, the council has not 
finished the financial planning for 
the store. Ang said that estimates for 
monthly expenses such as rent, pro-
duction and upkeep are still incon-
clusive because all expenditures have 
not been calculated.

“The amount is still in the works 
and should be available in the com-
ing weeks when more of the finances 
and plans are settled,” Ang said. “A.S. 
[Council] has allocated a total of 
$204,000 to the store last quarter — 
in full total. The initial amount will 

go to the initial costs that are needed 
to be covered to start up the store: 

merchandise, 
employee pay, 
construct ing 
the physical 
store and other 
costs that may 
come about 
as we cre-
ate the store, 
financially and 
physically.”

B u t 
McEuen said 
he is hopeful 
that the store 
construct ion 
will begin 
once council 
picks a spe-
cific designer 
to blueprint 

the space, decides which suppliers 
the merchandise will come from and 

hires managers to run the store.
Over the summer we worked dili-

gently on figuring out a prospective 
location, layout and start-up costs,” 
McEuen said. “Triton Outfitters is 
still in agreement with University 
Centers and plans to meet with A.S. 
[Council] soon.”

Triton Outfitters will not be allo-
cated additional funds after start-up, 
until the store begins to pay off its 
initial capital — ideally, within a year.

“The store is going to sustain

HUVR is a re-imagining of Dawe 
and co-creator Tom Defanti’s previ-
ous brainchild PARIS, which was 
created 12 years ago at University 
of Chicago. PARIS, or Personal 
Augmented Reality Interactive 
System, was originally created for 
dental hygiene students, who typi-
cally practice their technique on 
cadavers. 

Using PARIS, the students could 
interact with plaque buildup on 
virtual teeth and train repeatedly 
without the cost and drawbacks of 
working on a dead body.

HUVR technology also has 
potential in other areas of medicine. 
Using a controller modified for a 
particular range of motion, it could 

help physical therapists rehabilitate 
clients, as well as handle billing 
and test patients’ range of motion 
and strength. In addition, HUVR 
could be used to examine objects 
not directly accessible to the user.

“Using the internet, we can inter-
act with people and objects any-
where,” Dawe said. “And if we record 
it, we can play it back an infinite 
number of times.”

One main goal of the HUVR 
project is to make virtual reality 
affordable. The main drawbacks of 
the PARIS system included its large 
size, a $100,000 price tag and its 
low resolution, since HDTV was 
neither widespread nor affordable 
at the time.

With large 3-D HDTVs now 
widely available, the system can be 
made much more affordable for the 
potential user. The most expensive 

component is the head-tracking 
portion. Current tracking tech-
nology runs from about $5,000 to 
$20,000 — well out of range for the 
casual home user. However, even 
without the head tracking, HUVR 
is still a heads-up display, or a sys-
tem that overlays extra information 
on the viewer’s field of vision. It 
can project information onto the 
user’s field of vision, which could 
be applied for recreational purpos-
es like video games, whose sales 
accounted for $19.66 billion in 2009.

“We no sooner started showing 
our HUVR prototype than some-
body wanted to put a gun handle 
on the controller,” Dawe said. “The 
interest from the gaming industry 
is huge.”

An Expensive Knock-Off  Cheapens the Deal
JASMIN WU/GUARDIAN

HIGHER EDUCATION — For most of us, 
the prospect of a decent job offer continues to 
power four years of marathon study sessions and 
all-nighters, but it’s long become common knowl-
edge that a 4.0 is no longer adequate to score that 
coveted Goldman Sachs banking position.

 In an economy with 14 qualified applicants 
for every available position, there’s a rabid search 
for the holy grail of postgraduate job security: 
internships. 

Last spring, the legality of these unpaid months 
of coffee-fetching was questioned from New York 
to California. Journalists and legislators alike won-
dered if making students photocopy memos for 
hours without compensating them — all for the 
glory of an impressive bullet point on a resume — 

was giving an advantage to those affluent enough 
to afford not to spend the time earning money.

Though unpaid internships are now de facto 
for any desperate job hunter, there’s a new trend 
called “placed” internships. Placement internships 
are the ultimate paradox, where students don’t just 
work for free, they shell out as much as five figures 
to work for free — and that violates any and every 
idea of equal opportunity. 

The number of opportunities to cough up 
big bucks for an internship are growing. The 
for-profit program National Internship Program 
has doubled its staff over the last two years and 
is beginning to expand from Washington D.C. to 
nearly every major city on the map. Each year, this 
organization helps students with an extra $3,400 

lying around to find housing and engage in a 
summer of free work. 

Then there’s the Washington Center. The larg-
est nonprofit program of its type, it has placed 
about 4,500 interns in the past three years. For 
$9,000 — the cost of a trip abroad or a year’s edu-
cation at UCSD — students are given the privilege 
of being ordered to do the busy work everyone 
else won’t lower themselves to do.

And for the less wealthy but still privileged, 
there’s the Washington Internship Institute and the 
Fund for American Studies, both of which charge 
over $7,000 for a summer of helping other people.

And these aren’t just small-time internships 
with companies that have less than a half-dozen 

While students are desperate to stay one step ahead of  their classmates, shelling out to “placement” companies to secure 
internships won’t necessarily move them to the front of  the class.

See INTERNSHIPS, page 5

Last week, Jon Stewart announced his Rally to Restore Sanity to take place Oct. 30 in 
Washington D.C. And let’s be honest: When more 
than 20 percent of the country doesn’t believe our 
president was born in America, we could use a 
little sanity. But with the media focusing on what 
will make “good news” and not “real news,” that 
statistic isn’t surprising.

In the constant pursuit of entertainment, our 
conventional media sources focus on any insult-
spewing group of Neanderthals that the rest of us 
might find amusing.  The problem is that people 
almost always take news outlets like MSNBC, 
CNN and Fox News at their word. When claims 
that Obama is a racist insurgent are reported 
alongside the weather, it’s no wonder more than a 
few of our more gullible brethren were drawn to 
political extremist groups like the Tea Party. 

When crazies attract attention, the media 
jumps to report it, which in turn swells their 
ranks. Hopefully, the Rally to Restore Sanity will 
draw media attention to one of the major flaws in 
American media: over sensationalizing extremists. 
Just because their ideas are extreme doesn’t neces-
sarily mean they’re news worthy. With any luck, 
it’ll remind the mainstream media that America 
is getting tired of their reliance on wacky fringe 
news flashes to fill their airtime, and that we are 
turning to other outlets, like “The Daily Show,” 
for news.

While the Colbert and Stewart rallies to “Restore Sanity” might attract Comedy 
Central groupies, their humor-based message is 
cheapening the effect of Glenn Beck’s rally.

Unlike Colbert and Stewart’s rallies, Beck’s 
rally was far more than simply a publicity stunt. 
Instead of acting like media-hungry puppies, 
Beck’s rally raised $5.8 million for the Special 
Operations Warrior Foundation. The founda-
tion gives educational grants and counseling to 
children who have lost parents in the special 
operations unit of the military and provides 
housing and transportation to families of 
injured military personnel so that they can fly 
to their side. The fact that Colbert and Stewart 
are being applauded for their mockery of Beck’s 
beliefs and generosity is nothing short of imma-
ture.

The conservative right isn’t the only side 
that thinks that the Comedy Central rally is 
doing a disservice to our country. According 
to Democratic consultant Kevin Wardally, it’s 
“very disturbing that people who say they really 
care about voting and making real change in 
D.C., will be taking thousands of people away 
for a comedy show, when they should be work-
ing in their respective communities.”

Instead of working against an honorable 
cause, these media pundits need to stick to late 
night humor.

On Aug. 28, the anniversary of Martin Luther King’s historic march on Washington, Glenn 
Beck, side-kick Sarah Palin and his legion of Tea 
Bagging followers held a march on Washington 
D.C. in the name of “Restoring Honor” and 
“American Values.” �ough he claimed that this 
event was going to be apolitical, Beck’s decision to 
rally is nothing but a scornful response to President 
Barack Obama’s leadership. Some choice gems 
uttered at the rally include “We’ll take back the 
government,” and the ever inane Obama–Hitler 
comparisons. Clearly, the Tea Party’s agenda of 
taking things too far has gone … well, too far.

After Glenn Beck’s ultra-conservative march 
on Washington, Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert 
announced their decision to hold counter rallies 
in Washington D.C. to combat the rising wave of 
political hyperbole. Good for them. Marching with 
— or rather, against — each other, Jon Stewart will 
be protesting Beck’s march, while Colbert will be 
defending it. Their comical attempt to reveal both 
sides of a political issue is a refreshing change from 
the extreme political polarization that seems to be 
sweeping the country.

Seeing both sides of an issue is never a bad 
thing — even if it’s through a Comedy Central 
showdown. Even though Jon Stewart is, as his crit-
ics say, only a comedian, his might be the rallying 
cry that hipsters and the American middle class 
need to combat the likes of Glenn Beck.

hits on Google. Placement intern-
ships boast summers working for 
Merrill Lynch Investing, the American 
Red Cross and ABC News, just to 
name a few.

Aside from the idea of paying to 
work, the placement internship is fun-
damentally unfair and cheapens the 
meaning behind those hours of work. 

As it stands, internships have 
always been for those who are lucky 
enough to be able to work for free. 
Someone living from paycheck to 
paycheck doesn’t have the luxury of 
spending valuable time working with-
out pay — and he or she certainly 
doesn’t have the time or resources to 
pay money to work for free. 

These placement programs are 
casting their nets and catching a very 

exclusive group of people: those with 
money. 

As unfair as the system is, it’s hard 
to fault those that have the advantage 
of money on their side. Even though 
we might glare enviously at the class-
mate that can afford to essentially pay 
his way to into a top graduate school, 
it’s impossible imagine anyone who 
wouldn’t, given the opportunity.

Still, these “placement” internships 
not only cater to the luckiest demo-
graphic, they undermine the entire 
experience. Internships — though 
once meant to provide professional 
experience in a field — are usually 
seen as evidence of above-average 
ability, and sometimes the mere pres-
ence of a certain internships imbibes 
an applicant with all sorts of attractive 
qualities. 

But when the main reason an 
applicant receives an internship is a 
pocket full of cash, these positions 
are no longer indicators of talent 
but instead gauges of padded bank 
accounts. Having a paid-for intern-
ship won’t be enough to boost anyone 
to the top of any list.  

By dangling the promise of a 
glowing resumé — and the simulta-
neous threat of a postgraduate career 
at McDonald’s — in front of hard 
working, ambitious students, these 
companies are taking advantage of 
their fear. 

We know that we have to play “the 
game” to get into graduate school, but 
this game is becoming too pricey.

Dear Editor,
After throwing a bunch of dirty 

MQs off of a stack of Guardian news-
papers, I looked on with joy at some-
thing I never imagined: an article 
about guns in the Guardian! Although 
I totally disagree with Iron Sights 
being a “wet dream,” I will admit that 
getting out to shoot some guns with 
friends is always fun.

I feel that not very many people 
know about the Marksmanship Club 
at UCSD. Our club is dedicated to 
everything involving firearms, includ-
ing, but not limited to: firearms safety, 
appreciation and understanding of 
the mechanics of firearms, improv-
ing firearms skills and understanding 
firearms laws.

So I encourage you and everybody 
that went shooting with you to join 
the Marksmanship Club. You can find 
the club online at www.marksman-
shipclub.org, and can e-mail the club 
at marksmanshipclub@ucsd.edu.

Dear Editor,
I came from a pretty boring town 

in Northern California. My dream 
was to go to college in Southern 
California not just because of its 
reputation for perpetual warmth 
and a more attractive population, 
but because it’s portrayed as a party 
place. Unfortunately, that is not 
what I unknowingly signed up for 
when I accepted UCSD. Instead, as 
a freshman, I’m either surrounded 
by virgins who can’t even fathom 
being out after 10 p.m., or people 

who magically become drunk and 
are stumbling around after their first 
beer. 

Who do I have to bang in order 
to have some fun around here? Do 
I really have to drive over to San 
Diego State to have some sort of fun?

Despite what people may think, 
college is not about education. It’s 
about being social, doing stupid 
shit, taking drunken photos of your 
friend humping the Triton statue or 
what have you. 

This experience is for you and 
your kids to look back at and be 
really, extremely embarrassed of by 
— like the night that you got totally 
shitfaced and woke up the next 
morning next some hideous strang-
er, probably with a penis drawn on 
his face. 

That’s what I was expecting … 
not knocking on the door of my 
suite mate just to make sure she’s real 
... and alive. I shouldn’t have to be 
sitting in my half-empty suite while 
my crying suite mates are visiting 
home to cure their ridiculous home-
sickness only 20 minutes after their 
parents have left. 

But here I am, contemplating 
having my own little party with the 
bottle of 151 stashed under my bed 
so I can drown out the noise of my 
remaining suite mates gushing about 
the upcoming “Glee” episode. Oh, 
the life of a freshman at UCSD.

BEST FINE ARTS PROFESSOR

BEST MATHEMATICS PROFESSOR 

F ine arts professors are the bad-asses of UCSD’s faculty. They never plan their lectures, and they refuse to let you know where to find the syllabus. After a year’s worth of classes, it’s clear to me that Ricardo Dominguez is the most impressive professor ever to put symbolic brush to metaphorical canvas.
Already infamous on campus for his controversial projects that have everyone riled up, Dominguez’s 

classes are nothing short of outrageous. His lectures are more like performances, where he dazzles the 
artistically inclined and frustrates math majors with what seem like nonsensical tirades. He’s not teach-
ing to impart knowledge, but to inspire thought. He has a flair for the dramatic — emphasizing each 
word, gesturing wildly. The content is so shockingly pornographic, students walk out and drop the 
class. If you’re like us, you’ll be paralyzed, terrified by his brilliant psychosis. 

It’s not for everyone, as those who evacuate the room early on can tell you. But, as the class hits 
its groove, survivors are loaded up with challenging projects that inspire artistic growth. Dominguez 
emphasizes that art is not contained in the world of the concrete, like in paintings and statues, but 
exists mostly in the ephemeral, which he defines as the actions that cease to exist after the moment 
has passed. Life itself becomes your art. 

As he talks, you can tell that Dominguez infuses art into his everyday tasks — it’s everything to 
him. It’s hard not to be inspired.

O ne of the worst thing ever invented — clocking in just after Furbies, but before fist-pumping bros — are three-hour classes. After sitting through five grueling courses, I know firsthand how tedious they can be. It takes a special kind of charm to make these 
gabfests into something students bother attending,  but for sociology professor John Skrentny, 
it’s just another day at the office.

The cards seem to be stacked against him: a three-hour class that runs into the evening, 
lectures on the sociological nuances of law and a massive room that makes sleeping both incon-
spicuous and ideal. Instead, the man turned water into wine — he gestured, he chuckled, he 
paced, he joked. Skrentny’s teaching style is based on the Pied Piper, leading his students to their 
ideological destination before they even realize they’re following. Skrentny spends class time 
telling funny stories about his childhood, asking for students’ opinions on current sociological 
matters and discussing the facets of law. The man has turned teaching into a performance art.

Plenty of people will tell you his classes are easy and — true enough — it is possible to 
scrape by with minimal studying, which is a testament to his ability to make a complex con-
cept seem simple. Soon, you’ll forget you’ve been watching the Piper play for the past few 
hours, paralyzed by his teaching finesse and ready to follow his analysis.

W hen it comes to signing up for classes, hours of WebReg deliberation and fiddling with Class Planner go into carefully crafting the perfect schedule. There’s the early morning camp, who fortify their position with the tempting argument of getting the whole painful 
process over with. But the prospect of waking up after a solid Thursday night — Four Loko hang-
over and all — to drag yourself to an 8 a.m. calculus lecture is enough to put most people off.

Then there are the night owls who value their precious sleep. While lazing out of bed at 1 p.m. 
is a beautiful thought, this plan is not without flaw. Not only are these people nocturnal creatures 
that greet lunchtime with the dismay usually reserved for breakfast, they miss out on any number 
of evening shenanigans.

Starting late in the morning and getting the whole thing done with before (late) lunch, then, is 
the way to go. Your brain is more alert earlier in the day, so these mid-morning classes avoid the 
pitfall of dozing off in afternoon classes that fall right after a sleep-inducing lunch. Also, with classes 
that finish early, there’s no race to jam a Zanzibar sandwich down your throat just to keep going.

Finishing class before lunch also leaves the rest of the day to enjoy. For those who work, it allows 
the flexibility to incorporate your work hours into the week. Plus, with free afternoons, there’s plenty 
of opportunity to take full advantage of the college dream and laze around at the beach, or take part 
in some afternoon debauchery — isn’t that what college is all about?

M athematics is simultaneously many students’ least favorite subject, and a general education requirement for five of the six colleges. While math is the same in every language, it can be confusing regardless where you’re from. 
Unless you’re a genius that learned calculus in fifth grade, learning math requires a 
patient teacher who can help make sense out of the numbers, variables and the df/dx 
statements. 

At UCSD, Laura Stevens is probably the best there is. Some professors forget that 
many students struggle with the material and fathom how anyone in the class would be 
confused. Not so with Stevens, who knows exactly how to put the material — even the 
difficult concepts — in a way that is easy to understand. Unlike the research-before-
students phenomena that plagues many UC professors, Stevens’ lectures are animated 
and engaging. She writes the important points on the board to facilitate note taking 
and uses a good mix of theory and examples. Questions are always welcome, both 
inside and outside of class.

And in case anyone doubts her passion for her job, you can just look down: A tattoo 
with the symbol of pi adorns the top of her foot.

T o the head-bobbing hopefuls who keep a 24/7 plug in their iPods during finals week, there’s bad news: When it comes to studying, there is 
no magical song that will instantly make you more 
intelligent. Listening to Baby Mozart on a loop while 
cramming for that ethnic studies test probably won’t do 
anything except give you a few pretentious conversation 
starters. (Have you ever noticed how dissonant the final 
chord in Mozart’s Concerto in D Minor is? Wow, me 
too!)

When you’re struggling to stay awake at 3 a.m. the 
night before that dreaded chemistry midterm, you don’t 
need complex 18th-century opera. All you really need is 
to stay awake without getting too distracted. 

Finding that perfect balance is mostly a matter of 
personal opinion, but hours of trial and error have clearly 
shown me what isn’t a successful soundtrack to long 
hours of quality time with a bio book. 

Jazz is not the answer. One finals week I went on a jazz 
and blues binge, spending hours testing Miles Davis’ abil-
ity to improve upon my understanding of statistics. But I 
didn’t want to study, I just wanted to chill out. 

Then, as per a friend’s offhand suggestion, I created 
an S Club 7 Pandora station, thinking that childhood 
nostalgia might bring me back to happier times and make 
my essay on existentialism less painful to write. It didn’t 
— I just laughed my ass off with every new *NSync and 
A-Teens song that appeared. 

After a few more unfortunate experiments (Top 40 
hip-hop and bossa nova among the genres tested and 
found wanting), I landed upon my ideal study band: 
Ratatat. There are no lyrics to distract, and the rhythmic 
electronica is just varied enough to keeps one’s eyes open. 
So give it a whirl: Turn on “Wild Cat” and let the genius 
flow.

I t’s only first week, so most of us haven’t been burned out by the gauntlet of academics just yet (though we’re counting the days until the mid-quarter  mental breakdown) and have yet to resort to a handful of coke and Adderall to get ’er done. But for those venturing early into legal study aids, there’s a deluge of FDA-approved shit to get into. Caffeine pills, energy drinks, five-hour energy, coffee, soda — there’s entire indus-
tries devoted to helping cram the basics of marine bio, but process of elimination reveals the clear winner: coffee. 

For starters, you can check home remedies and homeopathic gimmicks at the library doors. Sure, you should theoretically choose the “healthy,” 
“all-natural” choice that won’t leave you shaking for hours, but you also should have read the first 10 chapters of that poli-sci reader before midterm’s 
eve. We’re a little past that point and a stick of gum won’t pull you through the night. The “no crash” 5 hour energy option tends to be unpredictable 
at best and ineffective at worst; stick with the tried and true. 

That leaves us with the popular alternative: caffeine. Yeah, you can try to shovel cartloads of chocolate into your craw in hopes of achieving 
some similar sugar-induced hyper-high, but you’ll hit rock bottom faster than Evel Knieval. Save your money. 

On the surface, energy drinks seem the most effective — even if they taste like a mixture of cough syrup and morning-after vomit. But when 
you look at the ingredients,  it turns out they have fewer milligrams of caffeine per ounce than an espresso shot. While a two-ounce espresso shot 
contains 70 to 150 mg of caffeine, a 16-ounce Monster only holds 160 mg of caffeine. Energy drinks top out at around 300 mg of caffeine, so even 
with latte prices climbing through the roof, coffee still provides you the most for your dollar.

Bonus points go to anyone who tries to study off Four Loko — a toxic mixture of caffeine, alcohol, and ingredients like taurine guarana. Timed 
correctly, you can end up spectacularly drunk just as the ink is drying off your MMW paper.

T here’s a few types of professors you don’t want to have. One of them is the guy who — despite his mane of graying hair and the fact that he uses the word “groovy” on a daily basis — is convinced he’s cool enough to relate to our 
hip new generation. Ethnic studies professor Wayne Yang is not that guy, but not 
because he doesn’t have any hair. Unlike the outdated professor trying to live vicari-
ously through his students, Yang has had his own array of life experiences, which he 
uses to turn the classroom into a multifaceted look at various cultural perspectives.

From the very beginning of class, he plays songs like “Wake Up” by Arcade Fire 
and “Going On” by Gnarls Barkley as students filter in, to make lecture seem less like an obligation and more like a privilege. 

As someone who doesn’t go to class if I don’t want to, it’s a testament to Yang’s teaching prowess that last quarter I refused to miss a single lec-
ture. Aside from delighting the hipsters with his elite taste in indie music, Yang has an uncanny knack for lifting students’ spirits. One lecture, sens-
ing the Monday-triggered haze of despair that usually falls over the room, Yang reminded the class of Harriet Tubman and how, compared to her, 
we didn’t even know what tired meant.

By incorporating his life experiences — teaching in Oakland, working against the elimination of ethnic studies classes in Arizona and found-
ing his own high school for low-income students, among other things — into his lectures, Yang keeps his students sitting on the edge of their seats, 
scribbling furiously in an attempt to transcribe every word he says.

 (Plus, it didn’t hurt that he offered extra credit for going to a Nas concert.)

T he best time to knuckle down at Geisel Library is that ethereal time of night when the last shots have been drained, the stereo is busted and a friend is drawing penises on your face — sometime after you finish puking, but before you pass out. Let’s face it. There’s really no good time to study.
College only lasts so long, but organic chemistry will always be confusing. Get high, get low, get down, 

get some food and then hit the books. If you must, skim the chapter as you skateboard to class on the day 
of the test, or maybe read it afterwards to figure out what you missed. But better yet, just don’t study at all.

Really, studying should be approached as a measure of last resort — something to turn to only in 
moments of desperate boredom or inebriated confusion, like when you get lost en route to Round Table 
and end up in the library instead. Or when you mistake your lecture notes for directions to the kegger.

That said, if you’ve exhausted all possible methods of procrastination and have managed a 
successful puke and rally, visit the library around 3 or 4 p.m. for maximum productivity and 

minimal distraction. Early mornings in the library are hectic with students printing off 
last-minute essays and frantic cramming. Lunchtime is rife with the odors of Panda 

Express and Rubio’s and anytime after dark means dealing with a daunting walk 
home through a deserted campus, as the singing tree blasts death metal.

Regardless of the gossip surrounding his educational upbringing, Ord and his legendary compilers class remain one of the staples of the comp sci department and an invaluable resource for anyone looking to go into the field. 
Ord’s greatest contribution — as far as students are concerned — is his compilers 

class. Potential employers flock to it, aware of how invaluable it is to their company’s 
success and how thorough Ord’s teaching style is. Ord’s class is like a golden ticket 
— a student who has passed those 10 weeks of hell is immediately more likely to be 
hired, regardless of his or her grade in the course.

Though the class is almost unnecessarily tedious due to its difficult content, Ord 
is more laid-back than your typical professor, and more than willing to help anyone 
who may be struggling with the in’s and out’s of binary and coding. Though the 
content may be exhaustive, there are some study benefits to Ord’s course. The tests 
are almost always reflective of previous exams, so the format and questions are fairly 

easy to deduce. Though he refuses to hand out past answer keys, Ord will give 
out old tests as per his policy: Ask, and thou shalt receive.

T here’s always the general tips to keep in mind when mapping out the most efficient schedule. For starters, don’t sign yourself up for back-to-back classes in Warren Lecture Hall and Galbraith, unless you plan for 
sprinting uphill with a backpack full of textbooks to take the place of a daily 
workout. All lefties should steer clear of Solis for its lack of left-handed desks 
(apparently there’s a classroom designer somewhere with a sense of humor), 
and  above all, beware the dreaded 8 a.m. lectures in Price Center Theater’s 
plush seating and dim lighting. Napping is inevitable. 

For those looking to cut down on the commute, with the added bonus of 
somewhere convenient to stuff your face in between discussions, Center Hall 
is a wise choice. 

The trek to and from Center Hall is only 20 minutes tops from anywhere 
on campus (by foot) and, for the lazy man, the shuttle stop is fewer than a 
hundred yards away. The building is relatively near Gilman Parking Structure 
and ridiculously close to the stops for any bus (city, shuttle or otherwise) that 
comes by campus.

On top of that, the wide spectrum of classroom sizes fit every discussion-
lecture need. Most classrooms have well spaced, built-in seating to avoid 
awkward, elbow-bumping encounters with your classmates. Room sizes — 
the second floor especially —are comfortable enough to allow for leg room, 
without feeling like you’re sitting in the nosebleed seats at a Lady Gaga concert. 

Situated next to Price Center for easy access  lunch, caffeine and extra 
school supplies, Center Hall also boasts a coffee cart conveniently parked 
under the front staircase for those emergency pre-exam caffeine fixes.

Center Hall’s other perks include moderately-sized bathrooms (slightly 
bigger than Geisel’s) on every floor that are usually clean and without a line, as 
well as the opportunities to people watch and schmooze your TA as you stroll 
down Library Walk before and after class. —ZOE SOPHOS *

deficit, and Chapman could come no 
closer for the remainder of the game.

In the fourth quarter, the Tritons 
maintained their level of dominance, 
and racked up another six goals 
on their outmatched opponents. 
The Tritons finished out the game 
with Donohoe scoring six goals 
and Madsen adding five of his own. 
Redshirt junior Graham Saber was 
the Tritons third-leading scorer with 
three goals.

Madsen scored his 50th goal as a 
Triton in the match, while Morton 
recorded his 80th block of the sea-
son. Sophomore John Butler added 
two goals for his ninth and 10th 
career scores. The Tritons scored 
their highest number of goals in 
one match since their 24–8 match 
against Claremont-Mudd-Scripps in 
2008. 

With the loss, unranked 
Chapman dropped to 3–4 on the 
season.

Despite the big win, head coach 
Denny Harper was unhappy with his 
team’s defensive play.

“You can well imagine I’m not 
happy about giving up 10 goals,” 
Harper said in an interview with 
the UCSD Athletics Department. 
“We were dysfunctional and goofy 
at best, defensively. Let’s face it: If 
we play this way at any of our other 
home games, wins are going to be 
difficult to get.”

The Tritons allowed 10 or more 
goals for the fourth time this season. 
Each of the previous three games 
were losses to ranked opponents, 
as the Tritons fell to University of 
Pacific, UC Santa Barbara and UC 
Davis.

The Tritons have a packed sched-

ule ahead of them and look to rise 
up the rankings past their 14th place 
position — three lower than where 
they started season. The Tritons 
next travel to the SoCal Tournament 
on Oct. 2 to Oct. 3 and will open 
play against fourth-ranked Stanford 
University in the two-day competi-
tion.

Harper said  the tournament will 
be a significant test that will show-
case the team’s progress at this point 
in the season.

“It will be a defining moment,” 
Harper said. “We can’t keep making 
individual mistakes, team mistakes. 
We still have pairings in the pool 
defensively that aren’t on the same 
page. It should be an interesting 
tournament for us; it always is.”

Saskatchewan — took the individual 
title with a time of 24:54, and was the 
only male runner to clock under 25 
minutes in the Division-II 8k race.  

Leading the Tritons 
on the women’s side, 
freshman Chia Chang 
clocked 24:24 to place 
39th overall. Chang 
has been the top indi-
vidual finisher for the 
Triton women in all 
three competitions 
UCSD has had this 
season. Sophomore 
Catherine Crisp, 
freshman Kamilah 
Foley, junior Aayrn 
Kobayashi and sopho-
more Jackie Sikkema 
were the other scorers 
for the Tritons, coming 
in 60th, 85th, 92nd and 
116th, respectively.

With four out of five runners 
placing in the top 100, the UCSD 
women scored 367 points, falling 
14 points short of 13th-place Minot 
State University. 

Sixth-ranked University of 
Minnesota Duluth took the team 

title with 70 points, led by runner 
Morgan Place’s time of 21:49 and 
individual title. Place was the only 
runner to break the 22-minute mark 
in the Division-II 6k race. 

Svet indicated that the 
runners were happy with 
the performance, but felt 
the team is capable of more.

“We didn’t have quite as 
good of a performance as 
we’re capable of,” Svet said. 
“We were hoping for top 5 
and we got fifth, so that’s a 
definitely a plus. But this 
race really showed that 
when we are all running at 
our best, we’ll be capable of 
some pretty good things.”

UCSD now has two 
weeks to prepare for its 
annual Triton Classic, to 
be held on Oct. 9. 

The men’s team will 
run the 10k distance for 

the first time this season, with the 
race beginning at 9 a.m. The women 
will remain at the 6k distance, with 
the race starting at 10:15 a.m.

Triton’s Harper Wary of  High Scores and Defensive Woes

Kevin	WU/Guardian	File

Senior driver Bryce Madsen shoots midway through the second quarter on Sept. 23. Madsen scored five goals en route to the 20-10 victory over Chapman.

L.A. Clippers or Oakland A’s games, 
which allow fans more than enough 
room to stretch their legs on the 
empty seats in front of them.  

Yeah, she could definitely beat you 
at everything

Anybody who has seen a UCSD 
women’s basketball game in the last 
four years might recognize the name 
Annette Ilg. The athletic, 5’10” guard 
made 62 starts for the Tritons, includ-
ing every game from the 2008 to 2010 
seasons. 

If you check the game stats of any 
UCSD women’s soccer match this 
season, playing at forward for the 

Tritons is none other than a certain 
senior named Annette Ilg. No, it 
isn’t another student athlete with 
the same name. After using up all 
four of her NCAA-allowed years of 
eligibility in basketball, Ilg decided 
she wasn’t done with UCSD athletics 
and went out for soccer. 

Ilg hasn’t played competitive soc-
cer since her time at Avon Lake High 
School, so it’s expected for her to 
come out a little flat, maybe struggle 
to earn playing time. Ilg, however, 
scored two goals in her debut against 
Dominican University on Sept. 10 
and added another days later against 
Notre Dame de Namur. An athlete 
that good is worth seeing while she’s 
still representing UCSD.

MLB Playoff  
Spots to Be 
Decided In 
Final Week
This week: The National League West heats up, every-one loves football and we take 
a look at the person who just might 
be UCSD’s best athlete. 

The West gets wild in baseball’s 
final week

There’s less than a week to go 
in baseball’s regular season, and the 
National League West race is set to 
come down to the wire. But with 
close to half of UCSD’s undergradu-
ates from the Los Angeles and Orange 
Counties, and the Dodgers getting 
thoroughly beaten on and off the 
field, odds are you and your friends 
are no longer paying attention.

For Bay Area fans, it’s another 
story: They’re either thrilled the 
Giants have hung on for this long, 
or pulling their hair out because 
the Giants have scored fewer runs 
per game than there are goals in an 
average World Cup match. Then 
again, Bay Area sports teams have 
been pitiful, unlucky, unable to come 
through in the clutch, or a combina-
tion of all three for the last several 
years. If the Giants can’t catch the 
Padres even with San Diego’s late 
season 10-game losing streak, no 
one will be surprised but their own 
followers. 

Padres fans, however, must be 
pinching themselves that a division 
title is still possible. With a pay-
roll less than UCSD’s annual tuition 
hikes, every baseball “expert” had 
consigned them to a year of play-
ing at a level equal to that of the 
Yankees Triple-A team. The Padres 
organization should be applauded 
for showing that money can’t always 
buy wins — or at least given a pat on 
the back for getting lucky with their 
young roster. 

College football sets record 
attendance

Major League Baseball had an 
average attendance of 30,338 in 2009. 
The NBA averaged 17,520. The NHL 
had 17,460 per game. On Sept. 4, 
Michigan opened its season against 
University of Connecticut in front of 
a record 113,090 people. Read that 
again — we’ll wait. Just to be clear, 
we’re talking about the University of 
Michigan and college football. 

Make all the arguments you like 
about larger fields and larger stadi-
ums, but that is a lot of people packed 
into the Big House. While Michigan’s 
newly renovated stadium is the larg-
est in the country, the amount of seat-
ing can hardly get all the credit for 
drawing spectators. In the same week, 
Penn State, Ohio State and Alabama 
all saw six-figure crowds.

Even with college football getting 
all the attention with its mammoth 
stadiums, the NFL and professional 
football remain by far the nation’s 
most popular sport. 

Sure, smaller arenas account for a 
lot of the attendance disparity across 
sporting lines, but keep in mind that 
the NFL gets two and a half times the 
attendance for its preseason games 
that the NHL gets for its Stanley Cup 
finals games. That’s to say nothing of 

See rose, page 11

With the stadium packed with screaming fans following a tail-gate at Warren Field, the Tritons 
were cheered on by students who had 
just finished their first day of classes. The 
UCSD men’s water polo team didn’t disap-
point as they blew away the visiting team 
from Chapman University.

The 14th-ranked Tritons never trailed 
en route to a 20–10 victory on Sept. 23 
at Canyon View Pool. Backed by a near-
capacity crowd of 1,492, sophomore Brian 
Donohoe led the way with six goals, and 
the Tritons went to 6-5 overall on the 
season. 

Donohoe indicated that the large crowd 
factored into the win.

“Very few of us have ever played in 
front of a crowd like that,” Donohoe said 
in an interview with the UCSD Athletics 
Department. “That’s the most people I’ve 
ever played in front of. It’s a pretty crazy 
feeling seeing all those fans and knowing 
they are all there to cheer you on. It gets 
you really fired up for the game.” 

The Tritons struck first, with goals 
from seniors Bryce Madsen and Dane 
Sequeira giving UCSD an early 2–0 lead. 
But the Panthers battled through the first 
quarter and tied the score at 3–3 late in 
the period.

Madsen added another goal to pull 
ahead 4–3 with 1:46 left in the first quarter. 
A penalty by one of the Panther players 

allowed the Tritons to play six-on-five 
for the remainder of the period, and the 
Tritons took advantage of the opportunity 
to pull ahead of Chapman and take a 6–4 
lead.

After Madsen scored early in the sec-
ond quarter, UCSD took a 7–5 lead. The 
Tritons showed no mercy for the Panthers 
as they went on to score seven unanswered 
goals, taking a 14–5 lead. 

The Panthers ended the Tritons’ streak 
with two minutes left in the third quar-
ter, and managed to skip three goals past 
junior goalkeeper David Morton. But the 
Panthers could not close the six-point 

UCSD DOMINATES IN 
FRONT OF HOME CROWD

The UCSD Cross Country team 
gave an impressive performance, 
taking fifth and 14th, after the lon-
gest road trip of their season.

 With just one home race left, 
the Tritons hope to continue that 
success on the road for the rest of 
the year. 

The squad headed to the 
University of Minnesota for the 
weekend, taking part in the 25th 
annual Roy Griak Invitational held 

at the Les Bolstad Golf Course. The 
Triton men ran in the Division-II 
8k competition, while the women 
competed in the 6k event, both on 
Sept. 25.

The men’s squad finished fifth 
out of the 28 teams competing, 
while the women’s team took 14th 
place out of 25 teams. 

Junior John Svet emphasized 
that the mid-season trip would help 
them later on.

“Traveling is always pretty 
tough, and it takes a lot out of you,” 
Svet said. “For [NCAA] Regionals 
— which is going to be big for us 
trying to get to nationals — having 
this kind of trip is going to get us 
used to traveling and having big 
races after traveling. It was defi-
nitely a good experience.”

Freshman Mario Flores led the 

way for the Triton men, posting a 
time of 26:40 to take 34th place out 
of 334 competitors. 

Sophomore Matt Lenehan and 
senior Jesse Morrill also finished in 
the top 50 for the Tritons, finishing 
42nd and 50th, respectively. 

Svet and junior Daniel Cooper 
came in 64th and 85th to round out 

the rest of the Triton scorers. 
UCSD scored 214 points, finish-

ing fifth overall, while Augustana 
College — ranked ninth nationally 
— took the men’s team title with 60 
points. Senior Kelly Wiebe of the
