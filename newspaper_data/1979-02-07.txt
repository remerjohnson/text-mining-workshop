UCSD isn't the only place'

student concern and protest. At 
Sta nford University, where 
Coors provides free. beer for 
fraternities, advertising 
revenue Cor the Stanford Daily, 
juzz concerts for students and a 
recycling center for aluminum

with the Coor connection , und 
are in the midst of a '''gruss

Vending Transfer 
A Mistake 

Students, faculty and staff pour quarters .into vending 
machines with amazing regularity on this campus. This 
year, it is expected that over $50,000 in revenue will be 
realized from that source. Quite naturally, where that 
money goes is a subject of debate in the university. 

Until July I, that money will go to the four college 
governments and will be used to fund various college 
activities ranging from graduation to the Muir Special 
Project majors. 

On July I, Chancellor McElroy will take those funds away 
from the colleges and allocate them to Food and Housing 
Services, where, he says, the money is needed to help 
reduce a $230,000 deficit. , 

After July 1, the college governments will have some 
funds left over from this year's allocation to go towards next 
year's needs, but it is doubtful the funds will last the entire 
year, After that, Reg Fees will be the probable source of 
funding . (Approximately $20,000 of Reg Fee money that is 
currently going to pay the debt service on the Third College 
Cafeteria will soon be freed when Food and Housing 
Services takes over that payment). 

The students and college governments have no prior 
"right" to vending machine money. There are as many 
faculty and staff using the machines as students. Still, the 
reallocation of funds involves two points that we find 
objectionable. 

First, the decision to reallocate the funds was made over 
the summer, with no student participation. The campus 
vending machine committee, which has student 
representation, was not consulted until after the decision 
had been made. We feel that any decision on this campus 
that involves or effects students must have prior student 
consultation . 

Second, taking the vending machine funds away from the 
colleges and channeling it through the Reg Fee committee 
takes awa1 decision-making authoritl' lrom the colleges. 
The college governments will lose the flexibility of funding 
they have had in the past, leading to a further loss of their 
already shaky identity. 

The administration seems to regard the reallocation as a 
fait accompli , but it doesn't have to be that way. The 
Student Center Board is working toward contracting out the 
Student Center vending machines itself and replacing the 
centrally-administered machines. The four colleges should 
also think about putting their own machines in dorm and 
quad areas, as those machines almost certainly are used 
predominantly by students. 

We are aware that McElroy is the final authority on this 
campus_ However, it has been demonstrated in the past that 
if students are emphatic enough in their disagreement , 
McElroy'S will can be bent. We urge the AS and other 
student organizations to continue their vigorous protest of 
this administrati~e action, a nd we urge all the students to 
support them.

Facilities to Expand . 
Students, Staff Working for Recreation 
Responses to Student Questionnaire Sought 

This report summarizes what 
students have been doing over 
the last year and a half to 
alleviate the shortage of 
recreational athletic facilities 
at UCSD_ A committee , 
composed primarily of 
students (4 students appointed 
by ASUCSD, 2 by GSC, 1 from , 
each college), along with the V-
C Student Affairs, Chair of the 
PE Dept. , representatives of 
the ' Caculty and staff, and 
consultants and starr support, 
met throughout the ' 1177-78 
academic year. This commit-
tee first reviewed \he use of all 

ty~ of athletic facilities on 
campus. Special surveys were 
conducted to gauge the student 
need for certain major 
facilities (such as the 
swimming pool, the gyms, and 
fields). The review indicated 
that most o( the (acilities were 
crowded and in continuous use. 
The pool, for example, was 
booked solid from 6 a_m. to 
midnight on some days, with 
waiting lines at noontime and in 
the late afternnon for open 
swim. The committee - ex-
amined revised scheduling and 
minor capital improvements to 
optimi:te the recreational use of 
the existing facilities. For 
example, although there would 
be enough grass playing fields 
(with the already-planned 
constructions at Third College 

and northeast of Central 
Library), they couldn't be uaed 
at times convenient to students 
due to darkness_ Adding Ughts 
to a major field would alleviate 
the problem_ Similarly, a better 
floor and better-diffused 
lighting would enhance use of 
the Recreation Gym; the North 
Balcony of the Main Gym 
sbould be acoustically isolated. 
from the gym Door; the 
dangerously cramped Weight 
Room must be expanded; and 
lights on additional tennia 
courts would expand tbeir use_ 

Notbing short of new 
facilities could alleviate the 
shortage in some areas. Only 32 
people at a time can be crowded 
Into the pool for open ~im. 
Despite the fantastic popu-
larity of racquetball, UCSD 
doesn't have a single full-sized 
court (oilly 2 smaller squasb 
courts). Additonal tennis 
courti and gym floor space 
could also be used. The 
committee examined a lal"le 
number of major capital 
construction plans to meet the 
indicated student needs , 
Particular attention was pajd 
to getting the most recreation 
for the least money. Many 
financing methods were -
explored, with a Regents' loan 
backed by a student fee plus 
external gift funds being the 
most practical in the face of 
rapidly inflating construction 
costs. The plan called for 
placing all the the new facilities 
next to tbe new fields northeast 
of the Centeral Library. This is 
how matters stood at the end of 
spring, 1978, 

A small student committee 
met In the fali to draft 
appropriate student refer-
endum questions, but it 
determined that tbe financing 
method needed modification to 
be practical. In particular, a 
new gym required almost one 
million dollars in ,ift fuDds and 
the University solicitation 
mechanism for these funds was 
then unavailable. The "Student 
Opinion Survey - May, 1978" 
found that recreational 
athletlcs was so Important to 
students (second only to 
student Health) that me were 
willing to pay an addltlonal 
$5/quarter or more for these 

ligbting of fields and tennis 
courts, a new swimming pool 
with jacuui, and racquetball 
courts, About ".80/quarter 
would be necessary to include a 
new gym. Faculty/staff/ 
alumni participation will 

"l'equire payment of a use fee. 
The main purpose of this 

report is to get more, direct 
.tudent impact on what 
facilities you want and where 
they should be located. To that 
end, there is a short poll next to 
this report which asks your 
opinions on the various types of 
facllities proposed_ These are 
the facilities the committee's 
research indicated were most 
needed and were ranked first in 
tbe "Studeat Opinion Survey-
May, 1971." 

The campus is currently at 
"steady-state" in student 
population, and tbe number of 
college students is not expected 
to increase in the next 20 years. 
All or the facilities could be 
built conveniently near the 
Main Gym; but expansion to 
include a new gym would be 
difficult or impossible and any 
substantial increase in students 
would probably be located 
nearer tbe Library site. Plans 
are underway to secure the 
additional gift funds for a new 
1)'10. We ask you to decide how 
important possible expansion is 
and the relative convenience 01 
the two proposed sites. 

We have two ,ood plans listed 
bere. One is more convenientiy 
located DOW; the other can be 
more easily expanded . 
Construction costs are in-
creasinl rapidly 80 there is 
definite advantqe to bulldinS 
now rather than postpOnins 
construction. Your comments 
are needed. Please return the 
poll to the Studeat Recreaton 
FaciUtia Poll Box at EDNA 
(Mail Code B-023). We'll clitest 
tbe results and report back with 
tbe fiDal plan for a referendum 
In a couple of weeks.

US, Japan, Europe Gird 
For Oil Cutback Effects '~ 

LONDON (AP) - Europe 
und ,Jupun have started to feel 
the "inch of the oil cutoff in 
Iran and the impact is 
beginning to ripple through 
the energy-hungry indu . 
trialized world, a survey 
showed yesterday. 

No longer bankrolled by $22 
billion a year in oil revenues, 
Iran has been forced to cancel 
huge contracts that could cost 
jobs in many western nations. 

In the United States , 
President Carter ordered 
federal agencies to press their 
fuel-saving eCforts in a drive 
to head off mandator.y 
conservation. Government 
and industry analysts warned 
that several more months 
without Iranian oil co'uld lead 
to gasoline shortages this 
s ummer, heating shortages 
next winter a nd !ligher price 
for both products. 

The .S. Department of 
Energy has put together u 
plan {or limiting gasoline 
co n !) umplion , s u c h as 
requiring gasoline sta tion to 
close early and on Sunday. 
That plan could be 'put into 
effect Aprill ifthere's no sign 
of improve ment in the 
ituation. 

Iruniun oil workers striking 
again t Shah Mohammcd 
Rezah Paluv i cut orr cxports 
which normally amounted to 
about 5.5 milli~n barrels a day 
in December. Ou tput h<ld been 
reduced since th end of 
October. 

British Petroleum . I<lrgest 
of the 14 Western comp<lnies 
in a consortium that ran 
Iran's oil fields , said not a drop 
of crude has been exported 
since Dec. 26. 

The country that was once 
the world's second largest oil 
exporter after Saudi Arabia 
now 'is only producing a paltry 
664,000 barrels a day, which is 
bare ly e nough to meet 
domestic needs. 

The loss of Iranian oil has 
sla hed world output by about 
5 percent a t a time when 

uppli es were tarling to 
tighten and pri ce were 
riSing. 

Japan , the world's second 
large t importer of oil after 
the Un ited States, imports 99 
percent of its oil and 20 
pe rcent of that ca me from 
Ira n. 

Last month the J apanese 
la unched an energy conse/'-
valion drive and the 

go\'e l'l1mcnt w;I/-ned that it 
may have to dip into sll"ategic 

rc~erves to kcep induslry 
gOlllg. 

Israel once got ;Ibout 60 
pe lTent of its petroleum from 
Iran , or 90.000 barrels. but its 
claims to be we ll prcpared for 
a cutoff with a large rest-rvc 
<l nd a promise from the nited 
States to make up for any 
shortfall for five yeal's. 

Fuel prices have risen 10 
percent in Denmark and 8 
percent in Sweden bec<luse of 
the cutofr. Denmurk got 
nearly one-foul1h of its oil 
from Irun, Sweden 15 (.)ercent.

wur than the public is aware or. 
He cited the memoirs oC Cormer 
PresidentNixon'sChieCoCStaCC 
H.R. Haldeman, in which 
Haldeman wrote that Nixon 
threatened to attack North 
Vietnam with nuclear weapons 
in 198&. 

EIIsberg credited the anti-
war movement with stopping 
this action, He expressed hope 
that a similar technique or 
public protest, which he said 
eventWllly cuused the end or 
American involvement in 
Vietnam, cun be used to 
someday abolish nuclear 
weapons. 

ElIsberg began working Cor 
the Pentagon in 1964 as a

Young Coach Leads hakyTeam 
By Jon Halperin 

This year, Vince Askey, as 
one of the youngest college 
level coaches in the nation, will 
be attempting tQ guide a 
veteran-led UCSD baseball 
team to Ita most successful 
campailD to date. 

Askey inherits a team that in 
recent years has wallowed in an 
abyss of losing seasons. It Is a 
team that Askey played for 

until last year, and he thus 
shares the common desire of 
his returning veterans to shake 
a loser's image. 

The following is a position by 
position breakdown of the 1979 
Triton contingent: 

PUcbln, 
Sieve Robertson: Robertson 

is the man Askey refers to as 
the "anchor" ofthe staff. It will 
be Robertson, last year's ace, 

with whom Askey will confide 
for tough strategical decisions. 

Tom Schwartz: In his third 
year, the Pittsburgh native is 
picked by Askey to be the most 
improved player this season. A 
hard thrower with a deceiving 
breaking ball , Schwartz is a key 
player. 

Tom Nicholson: With the 
strongest arm on the staff, the 
junior from Sanger will be 
available early as he will 
attempt to play varsity 
basketball concurrently with 
baseball. 

Rick Jaye : Jaye is a 
sophomore transfer from 
Northern California. He has a 
good fastball and excellent 
control. Askey claims thatJaye 
has all the tools to be a great 
one. 

Rounding out the staff will be 
converted infielder John Kosic 
and veteran lefthander Brett 
Homan. 

Infielders 
Mark Sharp: Sharp is a gi fted 

athlete who is a definite pro 
prospect. He is a potent 
offensive threat who will bat 
lead off [or the Tritons. 

Pat McGovern : McGovern is 
the team's fire plug. A strong 
offensive player he plays with 
tremendous emotion. 

Bob Allen : Allen will 
probably be the starting first 
baseman as' the s,eason opens. 
He is another returning player 
from last year's squad. 

Ace pitcher St ve Robertson will anchor the Triton baseball effort. 

Jim Momt: A hardworking, 
dedicated player, Moffit has 
progressed phenominally in the 
past two years. A converted

Dominate 
Surfing 

Good waves and clear 
weather conditions prevailed at 
the 1979 Black's 'Beach Winter 
Invitational last Saturday . 

Of the 76 surfers who entered 
the event , 14 represented 
UCSD. with five placing in the 
Cinul heats of their events. 

In the men 's division of the 
contest. co-sponsored by ' the 
UCSD Surf Club and the 

ational Scholastic Su rfing 
Associution (NSSA) , Mark 
Brolaski of UCSD placed first. 
followed by Tom Castleton of 
S"n Clemente High SchOol and 
Steve Powers. Bert Nielsen, 
another UCSD surfer, finished 
in fifth place. 

For the women it was Golden 
West College's Miko Schmid 
taking the title followed by 
UCSD's Denise Novarro. The 
top three winners in the 
women's division received 
NSSA medallions for their 
early morning efforts. 

Roy Gonzales of SlIn 
Clemente edged out Warren 
Co llege senior Rich Glc.lves for 
the kncebourd litle . Tom -
Linton, .lOother UCSD student. 
placed third .

Netters Edge Pomona 
5-4 With Depleted Team 

By Sheri Thomas 
Stan Wriwr 

The women's tennis team 
played their first match of the 
season agulDlit Pomona College 
lust weekend with Suturday 
night's exciting match ending 
in a 5 ... victory for the Tritons. 
The two evenly-balanced teams 
held many lengthy r:lllles 
en route to the UCSD victory. 

The successful drive was lead 
by first year team member 
Cecilia Kavanagh. who used 
stnltegy and technique to out-
duel her opponent. 

. 'Cecilia is our top phlyer," 
commented head coach Pat 

Stewart. "Her ability is very 
imprelising ... 

~avanagh launched the 
attack against Pomona and 
easily claimed her 6-4. 6-0 
victories. She teamed up with 
Donna Hunt in number two 
doubles to ..... lIy and win, 6-3. 4-
6. and 6-3. The triumphant duo 
was pr .. ised by Coach Stewart 
as having clinched the deciding 
games of the match. 

In other tennis action, the 
doubles team of Debbie Shapiro 
and Usa Winsten, seeded in the 
first position. couldn't break 
their opponents' momentum 
and lost 6-3, 6-3. 

Both l'OUches. Stewart and 
Becky Edles. :Ire proud of the 
team's performllnce and 
believe the season should be 
just as successful. "Pomona is 
one of the more dirrlcult 
teams."' explained Stewart. 
" Yet , we were able to win. 
aside from the fact that so 
many of our better players 
were out for the g:lme." 

Apparently several of the 
Tritons have eligibility 
conflicts, which interfere with 
thei r a bility to play of the team. 
However. Stewart feels her top 
players will return later in the 
season.

casino-type games. 

When the games close and the 
bets stop more action wiD

sporting goods, and clothing. 

"It's the blUest event on 
campus," according to Cbuck 
Gormley of the recreation staff 
who ia in charge of Casino Night 
'79. 

Last year's turnout was over 
1500 students, administrators 
and faculty. This year even 
more are expected and to 
accommodate this, the 

facilities have been increased.

coordinator Jeff Puchaliski.

The loss of Rob Gramme for

be the first that Askey will have 
to deal with. Askey will call on 
Mark Sharp and Bob Vaage to 
pick up the offensive slack . . 

Another lurking problem Is 
the lack of depth in the pitching 
staff. There are eleven double 
headers on this year's schedule 
o an injury to a starter could be 

detrimental .

'Movie, Movie' Return toDaysofYesteryear 
Double Feature in One a 
Tribute to Bygone Times 

By Beth Accomando 
Staff Writer 

Does 42nd Street or Golden 
Boy ring a bel\? What about 
Busby Berkely or John 
Garfield? Well , if none of these 
names conjures up a nostalgic 
memory, then Movie, Movie 
will be like an inside joke that 
needs explaining. If, however, 
you are a fan of old movies , then 
Movie. Movie will be a 
delightful stroll down memory 
lane. 

Movie, Movie is actually two 
movies in one and both are 
easily recognizable reworkings 
of old movie plots. The first 
film , done in period black and 

is a of the 

Warner Bros. fight films called 
" Dynamite Hands ." This film 
deals with Joey Popchik, an 
idealistic young man who puts 
aside his law studies in favor of 
boxing so that he can raise 
$25,000 for his sister's eye 
operation . " Dynamite Hands" 
is followed by " Baxter ' s 
Beauties of 1933," a glossy 
spoof of the classic backstage 
musical in which the young 
chorus girl becomes a success 
by replacing the star on 
opening night. 

Writers Larry Gelbart and 
Sheldon Keller opted for the 
double feature approac h 
because they felt that this 
would prevent the parody from

Movie, Movie , though, does 
have many entertaining 
moments mainly due to the 
excellence of the cast. George 
C. Scott, in his firs t real 
comedic role since The Flim 
Flam Man , gives a funny 
performance which is high 
pointed by his marvelous 
pa rody of Hollywood death 
scenes. The polished acting by 
vetera n s like Scott is 
co mplem e n te d by some 
rema rkable fresh screen 
ta lent. Barry Bostwick (of 
Rock y Horror fame) is 
delightful as the lanky boy 
wonder composer in " Baxter' 
Bea uti es " and he even 
manages to teal cenes from 
Scott. Also noteworthy i Harry 
Hamlin as Joey Popchik.

Sickler was questioncd in

the boycott by a student who 
asked, "How many Chicanos

not come up with statistics. but 
as 'erted that thel'e were many

read a letter wl'itten to the 
boyeotling union, Locallt366, by 
Ceasar Chavez, in which 
Chavez urged union members 
to continue the boycott.
