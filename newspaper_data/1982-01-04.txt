Moral and other 
help for Poland 

One consolation might be found concerning the 
imposition of martial law in Poland: the Soviet tanks 
did not invade. 

Of course, this is a minor consideration. There is no 
doubt in anyone's mind, especially among the Polish 
people, that the military crackdown was Soviet-
planned, Soviet·ordered, and Soviet·approved. 

The military crackdown in Poland is a blow to the 
cause of political freedom for people everywhere. We 
should all feel a sense of solidarity with the Polish 
people. The lit candle in American windows last 
Christmas Eve is only the first step in showing our 
concern for the events in Poland. The United States 

mu~t continue to decry its opposition to the brutal 
repression in Poland. As a democratic nation, we can 
do nothing less. 

Most unfortunately, however, we can do nothing 
more. The subsequent sanctions on Poland initiated 
by President Reagan, though well· intentioned, are 
misguided. Halting shipments of goods to Poland, 
particularly food , helps the oppressors and not the 
oppressed. Quite simply, the Polish people are 
starving, and they need a ll the assistance we can offer 
if they are to maintain their resistance to the military 
rule. As the Soviet newspaper, Pravda , pointed out, if 
the United States refuses to send food , the Soviet 
Union wil1 "save" the Poles by sending the food 
instead. 

To best help the Poles through this political and 
economic crisis, the United States must send both 
their thoughts a nd their food to the Polish people.

Notes from 'round the world 
PARIS - An e timated 

90,000 Polish students were 
able to leave home la t 
summer for study and travel 
abroad, 'mainly in Western 
countries. Unti l martial law 
was declared in Poland last 
month, the number of 
students tudying abroad was 
expected to rise next summer. 
Even the pro· Moscow Socia list 
Union of Poli h Students 
(SZSP) had int nded to fi nd 
and promote job opportunitie 
10 the West. 

Not surprisingly. Western 
values and tastes have rubbed 
off on these foreign st udents. 
And they may have played a 
major role in heightening 
student interest in the 
Solidarity·backed Indepen· 
dent Student Union (NZS). For 
the past year, the NZS has 
staged sit·ins. shut·down and 
strikes in an effort to 
"democratize university life." 

While Ea tern·bloc author· 
itie have heavily criticized the 
new st udent union for 
"publishing and distributing 
all sorts of anti·socialist and 
anti ·Soviet trash ," as Radio 
Moscow recently claimed. the 
tudent have demon trated a 

profes ionalism and res ilience 
that ca n't be checked forever. 

Ironica lly , a Czechoslova· 
kian admirer of Western 
va lues. Lenka Cvrckova, 
helped found the Poli s h 

Independent Student Union . 
For her role in editing a strike 
bulletin during campus 
protests last winter, she was 
deported and last known to be 
awaiting trial in Prague last 
August. 

'" '" * 
Before the events of last 

month. the national army 
daily, Zolnierz Wolno ci, 
characterized the Solidarity 
leader. Lech Walesa, as a 
"great sw indler. " The 
new paper accused Wale -a of 
having "cheated the member· 
ship of workers" Solidarity 
and slandered the authori· 
tie ." That hould make 
Wale a Time magazine's Man 
of the Year. 

* '" * 
Mos t American s would 

gladly s upport anyone 
working to bounce Ayatollah 
Khomeini from power. It 
would seem logical that such 
an anti ·Khomeini group would . 
welcome US backing. 

As is often the case with 
Iran , however. the opposite is 
true. The 17·year·old "People's 
Mujahedin, ',' the most 
formidable opposition to 
Khomeini' s ruling clique, 
doesn ' t want our help 
according to the group' leader 
Massoud Radjavi . 

For tarters, the Mujahedin 

orga nized grassroots resis· 
tance against the American· 
backed shah of [ran and has a 
long·standing grudge against 
the US government. Moreover, 
the group is financia lly secure. 

According to Radjavi , the 
mere appearance of collabora· 
tion with the US wou ld only 
play into the hands of 
Khomeini's propagandis ts , 
who have been characterizing 
the 34·year·old exile as an 
American "puppet." And less 
t han a year after the release of 
the ho tages , anti·American 
rhetoric still plays well in Iran . 

De s pite it s socialist 
lean ~ngs , t he "progressive 
Is lamic " Mujahedin isn't 
addling up Lo the Soviet 

Union either. In fact, Iran's 
Tudeh Communist Party , 
which has min imal popular 
s up po r t, is 0 n e 0 f t he 
Mujahedin's chief nemeses. 
Moreover. according to 
Radjavi , Tudeh members have 
been able to infiltrate 
Khomeini' s ru ling power 
·tructure. 

"What we want not only 
from the US, not only from the 
Soviets, not only from 
Pakistan ... Iraq ... Turkey. 
Afghanistan ," said Radjavi in 
an interview with us at his 
suburban Paris residence, "is 
please not to interfere wi th our 
internal affairs."

Solutions to the cheating problem Inexpensive sport 
Editor: 

It is depressing to read about 
the cheating problem that 
appears to exist at UCSD. For 
some reason, I felt that at a 
college of this caliber, it would 
be almost unheard of. It seems 
that it is just as bad as in high 
school. Now, as I think about 
it, I realize that cheating is 
probably easier in college. 
With exams given in a large 
lecture hall , it is next to 
imposs ible to efficiently 
monitor t he entire group for 
cheating. Also, with different 
TAs grading different exams, 
it is difficult to detect similar 
patterns of wrong answers 
among groups of students that 
might indicate cheating . 
Certainly the pressure to cheat 
is far greater In college than in 
high school. What can be done? 

In my opinion. very little can 
be done. Part of the problem 
stems from the general 
decrease in morality among 
young people. They do things 

today that people their age 
would never have done a few 
decades ago, and do them with 
little remorse. It has become 
an "in" thing to cheat,just like 
taking drugs or engaging in 

. premarital sex; it's an "easy 
way out." It 's simply easier to 
go out and party and cheat on 
an exam the next morning 
than s tay home and s tudy. 
Others cram at the last minute 
and fi nd they don 't under· 
stand the material; it 's too late 
then to seek help, so they 
cheat. In many cases. even 
those who have studied will 
get stuck on a problem on an 
exam, and will look at a 
neighbor's paper for a " hint" 
or to check their answer. The 
urge to cheat has probably 
risen in all of us; some people 
just control the urge better 
than others. 

There are some strategies 
that might help to discourage 
cheating. Essay questions 
tend to be difficult to cheat on, 
especially if they involve a lot 

of free response rather than 
just recalling and discussing 
facts . Giving exams in section 
wou ld make it easier to isolate 
test·takers and monitor them. 
Te a chers s hou ld st r ess 
punishments for cheating in 
t h e s yllabu s. Finally , 
requiring student involvement 
in section meet ings and 
encouraging student contact 
with professors and T As 
would increase study time and 
understanding of the material 
throughout the quarter, and 
therefore reduce cramming 
and the urge to cheat. 

Perhaps cheating can't be 
s topped. but certainly 
something needs to be done to 
curb it. As long as students feel 
that success via cheating is 
better (and easier) than failure 
via honesty, cheating will 
continue. The Honor System 
simply won't work anymore; 
we nedl a substitute that 
works.

Editor: 
This is in response to Kim 

Collier 's letter in support of 
the proposed jogging trail. I too 
run four times a week. 
However , unlike Kim, I have 
never received an injury while 
running on or nearning 
terra iu. . 

During my past two and a 
half years as a graduate 
student at UCSD, I have heard 
numerous complaints about 
the lack of funding for 
intramural and intercollegiate 
sports. The sides of Revelle 
Plaza are becoming increa' 
singly populated with 
representatives from Univer· 
sity athletic teams who are 
asking for financial contribu· 
tions. I suggest that rather 
than building a jogging trail , 
the necessity of which I am not 
yet convinced of, we use the 
money to support our existing 
athletic program. 

I am not trying to underplay 
the value of running as a sport . 

But one of the most attractive 
fea tures of running is that it 
need not be an expensive sport. 
All a runner really needs is a 
good pair of shoes and a long, 
straight road . So, I s uggest 
that we runners bow to the 
needs of fellow athletes,

Adventure is suitable but it

Big break 
, 

Editor: 
Having a Thanksgiving 

break before finals can be nice, 
but this break makes it 
difficult for some students to 
go home and spend this 
holiday with theirfamilies. We 
go home for a few days, come 
all the way back for a week of 
finals, and then return home 
again for the quarter break. It 
would have been a lot easier, 
and cheaper, if they would 
have started school two weeks 
early and have a six week 
break between quarters . This 
would enable students to 
spend this holiday with their 
families , without having to 
study or worry about their 
upcoming finals.

Law school acquisition considered 
Cal Western School of Law proposes merger with UCSD, other SD campuses 
Will UCSD get a law school? 
While the UC Board of 

Regents has yet to approve any 
proposal, UCSD administra-
tors have openly discussed the 
possibility of a merger with 
the California Western School 
of Law, a nationally accredited 
law sc h o ol located in 
downtown San Diego. 

Assistant Chancellor Pat 
Ledden said recently that 
UCSD "needs to have a state 
supported law school" since 
"San Diego is going to be one of 
the largest cities of the 21st 
century." 

Officials from California 
Western feel that a merger 
with UCSD would be 
beneficial and very feasible. 

"What we're interested in is 
C:t well-known and highly 

regarded univers ity," Cal 
Western President Robert 
Castetter told a reporter. "One 
that has a very favorable 
national reputation and 
perhaps one that already has a 
post graduate or professional 
school. 

"UCSD is not only a top 
school, but it is also in the 
same location and the same 
general area (as Cal 
Western)," Castetter said . 

However, six years a~o. Cal 
Western made a Similar 
merger effort with the UC · 
Hastings School of Law in San 
Francisco - but was 
unsuccessful. 

Castetter said the UC· 
Hastings merger failed since it 
was predicated on a $3 million 
payment to the United States 

Internati onal U n iversity. 
However , now that Cal 
Western is an independent 
entity, no such legal problems 
exist, Cas tetter said. adding 
that Cal Western's accredita· 

tion and ItS $15 million in 
assets will encourage the 
Regents to agree to a merger. 

Presently, no concrete 
proposal has been submitted to 
the Board of Regents. 

UCSD officials , however, 
have made one demand: that 
the 1a w school move its base of 
operations out of downtown 
San Diego and onto the UCSD 
campus. 

Future unclear for '34' 
The legal fate of the "UCSD 

34", a group of students 
arrested last June for staging a 
sit-in of Chancellor Richard 
Atkinson 's office, may be 
nearing resolution . 

At a court hearing 
November 24, the San Diego 
City Attorney offered co drop 
charges if all 34 tudents pay a 
small fine and fulfill the terms 

of one year's administrative 
probation. Included in the 
offer was a requirement that 
students spend 25 hours 
working on s udent organi-
zations. 

The 34 students will confer 
with their attorney, Clifton 
Blevms. before acceptlllg or 
rejecting the offer. 

If no compromise is reached 
within the next two weeks. a 
trial date will be set for Jan. 28. 

The "UC D 34" face 
charges of "trespa!>sing" and 
"failure to dlsper e" which 
were Incurred la. tJune during

How to jog the right

Running lik ' religion and

the benefits will seem

WHAT'S THE 
DIFFERENCE? 
The difference: A Written 

Guarantee. We have student 
discounts, and evening hours, 

just like many other shops. But, 
unlike others, we back up all our 

work in writing. If, after we've cut, 
permed, or colored your hair, you' re 
not completely happy, call us within 

seven days. We' ll redo your hair at no 
extra charge. That's a big difference.

Human 
migration 
continued from page 9 
also believes that we are alone 
within this galaxy because, if 
his prediction is right , other 
technological societies could 
have reached Earth long 
before this and "there is no 
evidence of their engineering 
projects, although admittedly , 
we have only begun to explore 
the solar system and we 
cannot be sure." 

Jones bases his time scale on 
complex computer cakula 
tions, but the human factor 
enters into his conclusions . 
Traditionally, he says, life 
itself is a very diffuse form of 
matter - viruses and many 
plants migrate through wind 
and water flow; homo erectus 
spread across the face of the 
Old World ; homo sapiens , 
developing a wide range of 
technolOgIcal skills, spread 
into the New World and t he 
Pacific; and there are still 
s ignif icant migrations 
occurring around the globe. 

"Mankind typically mi· 
grates. If we try to picture our 
future as a technological 
species, we can imagine the 
outcome to range from a total 
collapse of modern society to 
an unbounded future in which 
humanity spreads outward 
from Earth into the solar 
system and beyond to the 
stars. Intert wined with our 
futu re is the question of who 
else is out there. 

"Since man first realized 
that the stars and planets 
might be more than just bright 
lights in the sky, the question 
has been posed. Eminent 
physicist Enrico Fermi 
phrased it this way: 'Where is 
everybody?' " 

Jones comments that if his 
theory is correct, then other 
technological societies within 
our galaxy could have reached 
Earth by now. But, he says, if 
he is wrong and interstellar 
travel is im practical, or if the 
ex pansion rate of a species 
capable of sailing the vast 
inters tellar void is a great deal 
slower than 60 million years, 
then "the absence of aliens in 
our midst becomes an 
inconsequential observation." 

Jones points to the foot-loose 
habits of mankind as 
indicative that space will some 
day be colonized by human 
beings, citing the flood of 
emigrants to America, and the 
herculean voyages of 
Polynesians in double-hulled 
canoes , who settled the Pacific 
island chain. 

He foresees space coloniza-
tion beginning with manned 
space habitats in' eosynchro-
nous orbits around our planet, 
followed by expansion into the 
solar system, then into the 
galaxy. 

"Initially, those who go into 
space will return periodically, 
but then, in a few hundred 
years, when we have the 
technology, settlements will 
be placed within the vicinity of 
stable, medium-sized stars. 
Settlers will 'mine' the 
asteroids and moons orbiting 
these stars, for their needs. 
Once you have generations of 
people living in space, who 
know no other life and who 
reach a natural population 
saturation point, the exodus 
will begin. People will begin to 
move on, to establish other 
habitats. It is a never·ending 
process, for which we have 
ample evidence on our own 
planet, down through the 
millenia."

Man's journey to the stars 
continued from page 10 

J o ne s s a ys a s s uch 
expansion continues over long 
period s, when biological 
evolution of the human race 
may change adaptively, the 
technology they develop will 
migrate with the people. In a 
sense, the physicist says, 
survival will be assured for the 
colonists because the stars 
which they will reach are so 
far apart that a supernova 
explosion would not be able to 

. entirely wipe out all remnants 
of humans in space. 

"Ancient settlements may 
wither or disappear, but the 
migra t ion s h ould, by its 
diffuse nature, reach virtually 
every corner of the galaxy." 

In its simplest form, Jones' 
theory is ba sed on an 
estimated distance between 
potential settlement sites, 
beginning with the solar 
system, then proceeding to the 
nearby stars. The speed of the 
migration wave will then be 
the average distance between 
sites, divided by the sume of 
the travel time and the 
population growth time. Such 
growth time will follow a well· 
established curve, if humans 
in space adhere to the pattern 
of humans on Earth. 
Traditionally, Jones points 
out, new colonies experience 
an explosive growth which 

t hen sett les down. MIgration 
soon follows, usually at 700-
year in tervals. 

Habi t a ts w i ll almost 
certainly orbit s tars. Jones 
believes, and they will be stars 
that areof a certain lu minosity 
- hot, bright stars will radiate 
too intensely for safety and the 
light from old and small stars 
will be too feeble to be useful. 
Medium·size s ingle stars wi ll 
support most colonists, as 
many as a t rill ion, ult Imately, 
compared to the estimated 20 
bill ion people that earth might 
support. Single stars that fit 
such criteria are spaced about 
seven light years apart. on an 
average. (A light yeal IS the 
dist ance ligh t travels in a year, 
when moving at 186,000 miles 
per second .) Jones believes 
craft of the future traveling at 
about seven percent the speed 
of light could reach from the 
solar system to a star such as 
"Barnard's Star," in the 
Constellation of Ophiucus, in 
about 80 years. 

"Such a journey is currently 
beyond our means," Jones 
admits, "Pioneer 10 will take 
about 70,000 years to travel 
seven li~ht years. But is is 
comforting to note that 
conceptual studies show ships 
capable of relativistic flight 
require only sophis ticated 
technology for their operation , 

not mag ic! The British 
I n terp laneta r y Society' 
Project Daedelus is a study of 
such a craft." 

Numerous schemes have 
been descr ibed for powering 
interstellar fligh t. including a 
"pellet s tream" method that 
would launch deuterium fuel 
pellets ahead of a space ship. 
which it could t hen take on 
board as needed. Large lasers, 
focusing enourmous amounts 
of sunlight in space collectors, 
may someday be used by space 
dwellers, as could fUSIon 
engines. 

"Such methods could be 
tremendous, in that they 
preclude the vessel having to 
carry large amounts of fuel. If 
a laser could be used to 
accelereate the interstellar 
craft to high velocity, then the 
vessel would have to carry 
only engines and fuel to slow 
the craft , as it approaches its 
target. " 

Jones says calculation s 
already show that with a 
deceleration engine operating 
for a seven·light·year journey 
at constant thrust, a 10 
percent-efficient engine could 
make that journey in about 
100 years. 

As to the presence of 
extraterrestrials in our 
galaxy , Jones concludes that

Clarinet 
program 
this week 
All-Mozart show 
set for this Wed. 

The UCSD Music Depart· 
ment , which is well-known 
both locally and international-
ly for its presentation of new 
works in premiere perfor-
mances and its unusual and 
innovative programs, will be 
host to another kind of first in 
Mandeville Auditorium on 
Wednesday evening, at 8 p.m. 

The All-Mozort Program 
will consist entirely of those 
major compositions written 
for Mozart's friend and fellow 
Freemason, clarinetist Anton 
Stadler. The greatness and 
variety of forms of these works 
(a piano trio, a quintet for 
clarinet and strings, a concerto 
with orchestra, and one of 
Mozart's last great set piece 
arias with clarinet obligato) 
helped assure the c l:arinet's 
lasting importance as a solo, 
chamber music, and orches-
tral instrument. 

The idea for this program 
occurred to UCSD Visiting 
Assistant Professor William 
Powell as he was preparing a 
lecture titled "The Symbiosis 
of Composer and Performer in 
the Exploration of New 
Instrumental Techniques" 
which was to be presented in 
Valencia, California at the 
UCSD - CalArts co-sponsored 
Contemporary Music Festival , 
1981. 

Visiting Assistant Professor and clarinetist William PoweD 

"At the time I began work on 
my lecture," says Powell, "I 
was becoming rather dis-
turbed that a couple of student 
composers had brought to me 
completed , and even inked , 
scores for clarinet which had 
quite obviously been written 
with only a textbook 
knowledge of the instrument. 
It was apparent that they had 
never talked to a clarinetist to 
find out whether or not what 

they had in mind was really 
feasible. 

"At about this time also, J 
received a copy of a recently 
discovered work composed by 
Anto Stadler, the clarinetist 
for whom Mozart had written 
so me of hi s greatest 
masterpieces. Stadler's was a 
mediocre piece at best, but in 
playing through it J notices 
certain passages which 
seemed to have been lifted 
bodily from Mozart's Clarinet 
Concerto or the Clarinet 
Quintet. While these passages

were not identical to Mozart's, 
they had the same feeling 
technicallv. 

"Further research led me to 
discover that Stadler was 
himself something of an 
explorer of new techniques 
and during the 1780's and 
1790's he was engaged in 
experimenting with extending 
the clarinet 's lower compass. 
Mozart happily accommodated 
Stadler's innovations in much 
the same way that some 
contemporary corqposers use

Mind", "Stardust" and "On 
the Road Again" are mega-
hits, and his last two albums, 
Somewhere Over the Rainbow

platinum.

Clarinet 
concert 
continued from page 15 
quarter tones, multiphonics, 
glissandi and other techniques 
developed by today's perfor-
ming artists. 

"The more these thoughts 
circulated in my mind, the 
clearer it became that the vast 
majority of those works which 
have survived to become 
established in the clarinet 
repertory all had something 
unique in common - all had 
been written with a specific 
performer in mind . this 
includes not only the works of 
Mozart, but those of von 
Weber , Brahms , Spohr , 
Debussy, Nielsen, Copland, 
Hindemith and many others as 
well." 

Clarinetist Powell will be 
joined by UCSD faculty 
members Carol Plantamura,

In the early 1960's, Soviet literature 
uruielWent a renaissance. and fonnerly 
forbidden topics became the themes of 
controversial new works of fiction. With 
the renewed repression of the 1970·s. 
many writers were driven into the ranks 
of the dissidents and eventually became 
exiles. This course will deal primarily 
with novels and short stories published 
in the Soviet Union and abroad that 
reflect the fresh perspectives 
characteristic of the best Soviet writers 
of the past two decades. Many of these 
works are remarkable for their 
frankness. Among the topics that will be 
discussed in class are the efforts of the 
so-called "village writers" to present an 
unvarnished view of life In the 
countryside, the social malaises that 
beset Soviet intellectuals, and the 
stultifying and sometimes comical effects of the bureaucracy on day-ta-day existence. 
Some of the readings will include stories and novels by Vladimar Voinovich, Yuri 
Trifonov, Vlktor Nebrasov, Valentin Ra put/n, and Vasili Shukshin.

UCSD women capture National title 
Volleyball team wins Division III championship in Tennessee 

BY TIM PICKWELL 
sport. Editor 

In what was easily the 
biggest victory in the history 
of UCS D a t hletics, t he 
women's volleyball squad 
defeated Juniata College of 
Pennsylvania, Dec. 19, to 
cap t u re to 1981 NCAA 
Divisional III National 
Championships. 

"This championship is what 
we've been aiming for since 
the program has been in 
ex is ten ce ," s ays Inter· 
collegiate Athletic Director 
Judith Sweet. 

The Tritons, 36-8, earned 
the title by defeating Smith 
College in the regional playoffs 
and traveling to Marysville, 
Tennessee for the Final Four 
Tournament. 

The women rolled over 
o cidental College in four 
games, Dec. 18, to set up the 
title match with Juniata. The 
Pennsylvania college, 38-5, 
turned the final into a cat fight 
by tying the match with a 
fourth'game victory 17·15, 
But, then, recalls Coach Doug 
Da nnevi k , " We dec ided 
enough was enough." UCSD 
crushed Juniata 15·1 in the 
decisive fifth game. All · 

American Tammy Smit led the 
team with 22 kills, 

In a ceremony on the gym 
steps this Friday at 12:30 pm, 
the team will present their 

"The first practice I 
knew we had enough 
talent to win the National 
Cham pionship ... 
trophy to Chancellor Richard 
Atkinson. 

Although t he Nat ional 
Championship was their most 
visible triumph, the club 
collected enough laurels this 
season to crown an army: 

-they won the California 
Coast Athletic Conference 
with an 8·0 record. 

-finished first in one 
regular· eason tournament, 
and second and third in two 
others. 

-had a 22·0 record against 
Division III schools. 

-beat Divis ion I and II 
colleges 14 times while losing 
only eight. 

-were the number one 
seeded team in the National 
Tournament. 

-were the No. 1 ranked 
team in th e na t io n 12 

DANCE! 

consecutive weeks, recelvmg 
every first· place vote. 

-placed two pla yer s, 
Tammy Smit and Lulu 
Schwartz, on the AIl·America 
team. 

- had three athletes, Smit, 
Schwartz and Molly Wheatley 
selected to th'e National All· 
Tournament team. 

None of this really surprised 
Dannevik. "The first day of 
practice I knew we had enough 
talent to win the nat ional 
championship," he remem· 
bers. 

Th is young, sen iorless 
quad captured one other prize 

which is harder to label than a 
National Champsionship: 
They captured the hearts of 
UCSD tudents and staff, 

With infectious enthusiasm 
the st ar ·s tudded squad 
focused the spirit of the 
campus. Their exciting play 
packed the home gym - an 
unknown phenomenon at 
UCSD - and the cheering 
fans caused more rukus than 
an intramural floor hockey 
game. 

"It is a goal of mine," reveals 
Dannevik, "to develop the 
team into the most popular 
sport on campus." 

He would seem to be on the 
right track. In his three years 
as coach, Dannevik, with help 
from intramural director Mike 
Hipp, has compiled a 73·33 

"This championship is 
what we've been aiming 
for since the athletic 
program has been in 
existence.' , 
record. in 1979 the team 
finished third in the regionals 
and fourth in the nationals. In 
1980 the club dropped to 6th in 

the regionals, but this year, of 
course, swept everything. 

All 14 women on the squad 
were recruit~ by Dannevik, 
who sold them on the campus, 
the climate and the program. 
(Division III schools do not 
award athletic scholarships as 
opposed to Division I and II 
coJleges which hand out full 
and partial scholarships.) 

Now that the Tritons have 
captured the title once, 
Dannevik hopes to make it a 
habit.

NCAA seeks host 
Marysville, Tennessee, 

site of the 1981 Division III 
volleyball tournament is not 
exactly a volleyball hotbed. 
Next year the NCAA plans 
to hold t he championships 
at a more suitable spot -
UCSD. 

Triton Intercollegiate 
Athletic Director Judith 
Sweet and Volleyball Couch 
Doug Dannevik reveal that 
the NCAA has approached 

UCSD about hosting next 
vear's tourney. 

Sweet reports that she is 
definitely attempting to 
secure San Diego as the 
1982 championship site. 

Dannevik sees the affair 
as not only a golden 
opportunity for his team to 
play in front of a partisan 
home crowd, but as a great 
boon for the ent ir e 
intercollegiate department.

Ifi Financial Aid Information - January 1981 iii 
From: The Diredor of Student Financial Services, 

Thomas M. Rutter 
UCSD finanCial aid will be more difficult dUring the 1981·82 and 1982·83 academic years 
than It has been In previous years. I am ISSUing this information to Inform students and staff 
of the complex and changing COnditionS. The fOllOwing major factors are effecting 
finanCial did: 

1. Inflation - IndiVidual student costs are rising ata rapid rate, adding $6()Oto 51000 per 
year to edCh student budget which reqUires 528 million In IIddilional funds edCh year to 
keep pace With Innatlon 

2 Ow:rervoliment - UCSD overenrolled 700, students for 1981 ·82 Without receiVing 
corresponding Increase In finanCial aid funds for those students who were eligible for 
support. 

3 Funding level - The campus based Federal, State and Umverslty programs are funded 
at a level equal to Prior years which falls to meet the Increased costs. 

4. Peli (BEOG) Grant Cuts - The Federal government reduced the Pell Grant for each 
student by IIpproxlmately 5160 in 1981 ·82 which equals 5228,000 Pell Grant fund loss to 
UCSD students. 

5, LaW Recruitment - Successful efforts to recruit students to UCSD resulted in Illte 
applications and heavy demands on financilll aid funds. 

6. Inaeas~d Fces - The University increased its fees by 575 per quarter, effective Winter 
1982. 

7 New Regulations - Recent new federal regulotions limit eligibility for Guaranteed 
Student Loans to students from families with an adjusted gross income under 530,000 or 
who are determined " needy" by the Student Financial SerYIces Office revie:w. 

8. nming - Program cuts, increased enrollment, rising student costs, lind higher fees 
were all determined well after the 1981·82 award cycle was under way. 

9. Computer Syltem Failure - UCSO financial aid is processed at U.c. Ber1<eley on an 
outdated system which is extremelY SlOW, inefficient, end unreliable. This system does not 
allow for timely processing or updating of awards or financilll openditures. 

10. Ncgatiw: fund Balances - The negative carry forward from 1980-81 in the UniW:r1lty 
student aid progrem reduced available funds for 1981·82. This negetive carry forwMd 
was genera~d by mlljor medical Health Insurance payments for UCSD students and a 
reduction In student Affinnative Action Grants from the University's systemwi~ 
administration. 

1981·811 
During the 1981·82 yellr, It WIIS necessary to increese the financial IIid for fees by 5150 

and reduce the financial aid cllsh payment by 5200 per student. Though this 5200 
reduction equals less than $25 per month over the 9 month IIcademlc year, it will have a 
definite Impclct on students who were struggling to get through the year on already 
limited funding and modest student budgets. In addition, there will be II $25 one-time fee 
Increase Spring quarter wtlich will not be funded by the Student Financllli Services 
Office, all students will have to pay this fee themselves. 

The decision to reduce each student's award by 5200 rather than give zero support to 
the hundreds of students wtlOSe appliclltions were on time, but were complete during 
the last month of the applicatIon period, was a difficult but equitable decision, This 
technique llilowed thIS lest group of students to shdre equally In the IIvaiiable funds.

An intramural dynasty? 

Eldos: -A team for all seasons 
BY PHIL LAUDER 

When one thinks of UCSD's 
most successful teams, one 
probably thinks of the 
intercollegiate men's water 
polo team, and of course the 
women's volleyball team, 
national champions at the 
sma)) school level. 

Yet there is another team on 
campus which is very 
successful at its game. The 
team plays water polo, and 
volleyball too, as well as 
football, basketball, tennis, 
and many other sports . 
Furthermore, with only one 
exception, this team wms at 
all of them. 

This team will never 
contend for a national 
championship, however, 
because it plays on the 
intramural level. The team is 
"Eldo's Orchid Pumpinis," 
probably the single most 
dominant team on the 
intramural scene. Their 
record of success is as long and 
as interesting as their name. 

Gil Bender, an economics 
major in his junior year, is 
perhaps most responsible for 
the two·year·old team's 
organization. Along with him, 
juniors Chris AmbIOse. Bill 
Hauer, and Brian Lariviere, 
and ophomore Tim Freuden· 
berger make up the core of a 
team whose unusual name 
stands out even among the 
bizarre names of intramural 
teams. 

Here is how the name 
originated: As freshmen , 
Bender and his friends were 

trying to come up with a name 
for the team they were 
forming. One suggestion was 
the name "Eldo's," the 
nickname given to one of their 
suitemates. Another was 
"Orchid Pu mpers," some 
strange creatures in a book one 
guy was reading. Another 
friend was eating linguini and 
suggested that as the team's 
name. To avoid any argument, 
Bender tactfully combined all 
three into "Eldo's Orchid 
Pumpinis." 

"Our opponents always ask 
us what the hell our name 
means," comments Gil. "The 
truth is, we really don't. " 

What they and their 
opponents do know is that 
they're a good team. The 
team's goal was to compete in 
every intramural sport on 
campus. In two years they 
have done just that. Since first 
playing one-pitch softball, the 
team has competed in regular 
softball, tennis, football, water 
polo, bowling, basketball (both 
three-on-three and five-on-
five), floor hockey, Hawaiian 
football. water polo, volleyball, 
and soccer. If any sport has 
been left out of this list , 
they've played that, too. 

Not only do lhey play, they 
also win. "I'd say we make the 
playoffs 80 percent of the 
time," Bender estimated. "Our 
one problem is that we can't 
win the championships. We 
come close, though, very 
close." The team has been in 
and lost several semifinals. -

Thev've reached the finals a 

· .. r~ \ 

'few times too, only to lose 
there. An especially bitter loss 
came in the five·on·five 
basketball finals in 1980. 
Bender explains: "One hour 
before the 2A final match, our 
center, Bill Hauer, was 
stricken with appendicitis and 
was taken to the hospital. 
There went our rebounding. 
We would have won it, too, but 
without the key rebounding 
we lost by seven." 

"Eldo's" finally got their 
first team championship and 
broke their playoff jinx this 
past fall by winning the 2A 
tennis title. "We've won one 
title now, so we should start 
rolling." . 

"Eldo's" has won in all but 
one sport. "Our only flop came 
in our freshman year in water 
polo. We came in dead last in 
the single-A division, which 
means that we had the worst 
water polo team in the school. 
That's why we stopped 
playing that sport. But we 
were the best divers in the 
poo\." 

Even so, "Eldo's" has 
proved itself a winner in many 
sports. The team has done well 
in UCSD's two all·around 
competitions as well. Two 
years ago, the team entered the 
UCSD's Superstars event and 
set two individual records. 
Lariviere broke the six-year-
old field goal record by kicking 
for 151 yards on five tries, and 
Bender broke the seven-year-
old bowling record with a 205 
mark in one game.

Basketball 
heads 1M 
sports 

BY LARRY GOLDMAN 
Staff Writer 

It is not only the first week 
of winter quarter but it is the 
week in which all intramural 
team captains are gathering 
their teams for this quarter's 
sports. Many teams spent 
much of the break practicing 
and planning strategy for the 
upcoming season. 

This quarter intramurals is 
offering men's and women's 
floor hockey, men's, women's 
and coed basketball, men's, 
women's and coed soccer, one-
pitch soitball, Hawaiian 
football , and team bowling. 

Winter quarter floor hockey 
is known for its late, after 
midnight games, in what the 
team captains refer to as the 
no-doz league. Basketball is 
known for being rough, but is 
still the most popular winter 
1M sport. Soccer, the most 
popular outdoor sport is just 
hoping to make it through the 
quarter with IlOOd weather. 

In the smaTIer sports, one· 
pitch softball acts as a tune-up 
for spring 1M softball, 
Hawaiian football is still 
relatively unknown, and team 
Bowling (two women, two 
men) always promises a good 
time. 

The team captain meetings 
are as follows: Wednesday, 
Jan. 6, women's floor hockey at 
4 p.m. and men 's floor hockey 
at 5 p.m.; Thursday, Jan. 7, 
women's basketball at 3 p.m., 
coed basketball at 4 p.m., and 
men's basketball at 5 p.m.; 
Monday, Jan. 11, women's 
soccer at 3 p.m., coed soccer at 
4 p.m., and men's soccer at 5 
p.m.; Tue day, Jan. 12, one· 
pitch softball at 4 p.m. , team 
bowling at 5 p.m., and 
Hawaiian football at 6 p.m. 

[ntramurals looks as if it 
will be very successful again 
this quarter. Other events 
coming up this winter are the 
ACUI competitions and the 
seventh annual UCSD 
Superstars AII · Sports 
competition. 

Eldo's are 
intramural 
titans 
continued from page 21 

"Eldo's " finished near the 
top in that competition, and 
finished at the top in the 1980 
Budweiser Super Sports 
competition. They represented 
UCSD in an intracity 
competition with San Diego's 
two other universities, 
finishing second behind 
perennial power SDSU. 
Obviously, "Eldo's Orchids 
Pumpinis" has some talented 
and versatile athletes. 

That fact is the only reason 
for their success, too. Says 
Bender, "We never rractice; 
we rely on natura ability 
alone. We might win more 
championships if we did 
practice, though." However, 
most of the teaJll members are 
also good students who use 
sports as an outlet for 
studying, and time for practice 
is not abundant. 

"Eldo's" opponents know 
they're tough. "We're not well 
liked, but we are respected."

Contraception research 
I:onlinued from page 11 
the cycle that result in the 
uterus being unprepared to 
support conception. 

reported in Science, Yen's 
group showed that the same 
LRF·agonist could act as a 
potential contraceptive by 
tnducing early regression of 
the corpus luteum when the 
agonist is given during t he last 
half of the menstrual cycle. 
However, since many women 
have difficulty determining 
when they ovulate, this 
method was considered 
impractical for widespread 
use. Yen's team also found 
that daily administration of 
the agonist would shut down 
the menstrual cycle, except for 

spotting. This method was 
considered less desirable 
because of th~ spotting and 
because the drug must be 
taken daily. 

Yen is the chairman of the 
department of reproductive 
medicine at the UCSD School 
of Medicine. Sheehan and 
Casper were research fellows 
at UCSD when the research 
was conducted. Sheehan is 
now medical director of 
Planned Parenthood in San 
Diego County, and Casper is 
on the faculty of Dalhousie 
University in Nova Scotia. 

According to Yen, there may 
be other therapeutic uses for 
this agonist. For example, 
since daily administration of 
the agonist completely 
abolishes the menstrual cycle, 
it is a potential treatment for 
pr em en st rual tension, 
endometroiosis, hirs ut ism, 
and the excessive menstrual 
bleeding experienced by 
women who have blood 
disorders such as leukemia. 
Clinical testing of the agonist 
as a treatment for precocious 
puberty has also been recently 
reported by researchers in 
Boston, The Salk Institute, 
and the National Institutes of 
Health. 

Space exploration 

Paradoxically, low doses of 
native LRF can also cure 
infertility in women whose 
brains produce insufficient 
quantities of the hormone. 
The UCSD scientists have 
treated twelve such patients: 
al1 have begun ovulating and 
four pregnancies have 
resulted. 

The LRF'agonist used in the 
UCSD study was synthesized 
and provided by Jean Rivier, 
Ph.D. and Wylie Vale, Ph.D., of 
The Salk Institute. The 
natural hormone was first 
,isolated and its structure 
identified in pig brain by 
Andrew Schally, Ph.D. of New 
Orleans, shortly before Roger 
Guillemin, M.D., Ph.D., of the 
Salk Institute identified it in 
sheep brains.

~()ntinued from page 11 
we are either the galaxy's first 
technological species, that 
i nterstellar travel is 
immensely impractical, if not 
impossible, or that the 
technological lifetime and/or 
the migratory lifetime of a 
species is always very short. 

" Although interstellar 
travel is certainly far beyond 
our current technical means, 
there are enough plausible 
schemes that the impossibility 
of space travel seems on a par 
with earlier generations who 
might have concluded that 
flight itself, and especially 
man powered flight, was 
impossible. Similarly, it seems 
that if a migratory species 
spreads beyond the kill radius 
of a supernova explosion, then 
its migratory life becomes 
unbounded. It would seem 
that our migratory life is 
unbounded, unless our society

I The conclusions one draws 
depend on one's philosophical 
bias - perhaps we are 
doomed. If we are, then it 
means there is nobody out 
there, no one to talk to, no one 
to teach us how to survive the 
birth of technology. The 
success of life in our part oft he 
universe may well depend on 
our ability to work together to 
solve our current problems 
and on our will to begin the 
great cosmic venture."
