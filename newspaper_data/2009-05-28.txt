MFA grads cram their 
yearlong efforts into the 
university art gallery’s 
well-lit closet space.

Price Center’s slew of students 
accumulating waste by the ton dur-
ing an all-day lunch hour has never 
made it the bastion of sustainability.

Until now.
The A.S. Council approved plans 

last week to draft a charter for the 
long-talked-about Sustainability 
Resource Center, four months after

In a move to cut state spend-
ing, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger 
released a plan this week that would 
completely phase out the Cal Grant 
program over the next three years. 

The proposal would eliminate 
all new grants, including those that 
have already been tentatively offered 
to over 80,000 students statewide. 
Although the 46,000 students with-
in the UC system who currently 
receive Cal Grants would be eligible 
for renewals, the maximum award 
would not be increased to com-
pensate for future UC and CSU fee 
hikes. 

“The size and scope of the inter-
national recession and [the need 
for California to] close a $24 bil-
lion budget gap have required us 
to put proposals on the table that 
would have been unthinkable just a 
few short months ago, and phasing 
out the Cal Grant program is one 
clear example of that,” Department 
of Finance spokesman H.D. Palmer 
said.

Palmer said students could turn 

to private lenders to pay their edu-
cational fees if the Cal Grant pro-
gram is eliminated.

According to UC spokesman 
Ricardo Vazquez, the propos-
al would result in a loss of about 
$110 million in financial aid for 
UC undergraduates in the 2009-10 
academic year alone. 

“We think the eventual elimi-
nation of the Cal Grant program 
would have a devastating impact on 
low- and middle-income students 
who attend the UC,” Vazquez said. 

Vazquez said the university’s 
own institutional aid would be able

Students wait for financial-aid counseling in the Student Services Center. Over 46,000 UC 
undergraduates currently receive aid through the Cal Grant program. 

Plan to eliminate state 
welfare spending would 
mean the death of Cal 
Grants, forcing students 
to turn to private lenders.

Two years into a cancer-clus-
ter investigation at the Literature 
Building, department faculty, students 
and staff have started petitioning  to 
move classes into Sixth College trail-
ers and holding office hours in on-
campus cafes or at the Cross-Cultural 
Center. 

Today, protestors will host 
“Literature Office Hours Here,” a 
demonstration 
on Library Walk 
from 11 a.m. to 
1 p.m., to inform 
students of what 
they perceive to 
be administra-
tive inaction 
in the ongoing 
investigation of 
the building.

According to 
professor John 
D. Blanco, the 
event will be 
quieter than the 
teach-in held on 
Feb. 17, when 
dozens of partic-
ipants marched 
to Chancellor 
Marye Anne 
Fox’s office 
to protest her 
response to pro-
fessor Cedric Garland’s report.  When 
his research found that an elevator 
in the building emitting high elec-
tromagnetic fields may have caused 
eight reported breast cancer cases 
between 2000 and 2006, Fox hired 
epidemiologist and UCLA professor 
Leeka Kheifets to review the report 
instead of shutting down the elevators. 
Kheifets is also an EMF expert.

“The event is to raise awareness, 
since it is hard to gauge the general 
mood when there are not a lot of peo-
ple left in the building,” Blanco said. 
“Whether or not the administration is 
taking action, many faculty members 
have done their best to find alternative 
accommodation for their students.” 

Kheifets’ review of Garland’s report 
on the suspected cancer cluster has 
been delayed several weeks due to 
complications with obtaining neces-
sary data.

Oumelbanine Zhiri, chair of the 
committee tasked with address-
ing concerns within the Literature 
Department, said that though 
administrative communication has 
improved regarding the cluster, many 
students and faculty are frustrated that 
Kheifets’ follow-up to Garland’s report 
— estimated on Feb. 10 to take 10 
weeks — has yet to be completed. In

The A.S. Council approved its 
2009-10 budget late last night, and for 
the first time in the group’s history, 
there’s still money left. 

With a projected revenue of $2.7 
million, the council allocated every-
thing but $369,641, which will fall 
into place at the annual Fall Quarter 
budget-revision session after campus 
enrollment numbers — and, therefore, 
activity-fee revenue — are finalized.

This new approach reflects a 
broader “financial overhaul” that A.S. 
President Utsav Gupta hopes will 
increase accountability and transpar-
ency.

The budget includes $550,000 for 
the annual Sun God Festival, $391,047 
to A.S. administrative salaries and 
$226,629 to student organizations.

Other highlights include two new 
student positions for the A.S. Graphic 
Studio and an A.S. Events Production 
Manager to assume the advisory role 
previously held by the University JOSEPH HO/GUARDIAN

The Sustainability Resource Center, to be located in Price Center Plaza in the space previously occupied 
by the EDNA office, will be funded with money drawn from the recent student activity fee referendum.

Gifts were the first order of business at last night’s monumental  budget-
oriented A.S. Council meeting, 
where the A.S. Graphic Studio pre-
sented all councilmembers with com-
plimentary T-shirts.

Two former employees of the 
UCSD Marketplace visited the 
forum to talk to the council about 
the grounds of their dismissal, which 
they attributed to unfair practices 
exercised by their supervisor. They 
hoped to have 
the council take 
a definitive stance 
on fair labor prac-
tices by passing 
a resolution that 
was tacked to the 
order of business 
for the evening. 

Resolutions aside, the bulk of the 
meeting was devoted to poking and 
prodding the 2009-10 executive bud-
get. 

Most line items were left alone, 
but stipends became a well-worn 
topic. Campuswide Senator Katie 
Hall moved to strike the line item 
for an office stipend for the Office 
of the President staff, which turned 
into a long and cyclical discussion of 
whether office staff merit stipends, 
and then how much. 

Campuswide Senator Bryant Pena 
said that student fees should be used 
to fund student activities, rather than 
go to office stipends. His sentiment 
was echoed by several other council-
members throughout the discussion. 

“We found [Advocate General 
Chris Rebert], he is awesome, he was 
not paid,” Hall said. “It’s our jobs as a 
council to get initiatives done, not to 
have to pay people to get them done.” 

The motion to strike the line item 
failed, but the stipend talk continued, 
though the budget will undoubtedly 

be revisited Fall Quarter. 
The council finished with the 

individual line items a quarter after 
eleven, and indulged in a self-con-
gratulatory cheering and applause. 

According to Director of Student 
Life Business Services John Hughes, 
this was the best he had seen the A.S. 
Council handle its budget allocations 
in the three years he has worked at 
the university. 

As for the resolution calling for 
fair labor practices at the UCSD 

Marketplace, sig-
nificant changes 
were made in 
terms of the 
language of the 
document in an 
effort to make it 
more pertinent to 

students. Nevertheless, councilmem-
bers took issue with the use of the 
term “fair labor” and what consti-
tute “unfair labor practices” before 
approving the tweaked document. 

The council then scrutinized the 
standing rules regarding finance and 
resources. The section pertaining to 
Mandate Reserves was heavily debat-
ed and was finally tabled with pend-
ing amendments for discussion and 
voting until next week. 

During new business Marshall 
College Senator Brian McEuen 
requested an additional $400 for the 
inaugural Freshman Pool Party that 
will take place this Saturday. The 
money was allocated, but not before 
McEuen received a slew of stern rep-
rimands from his colleagues.  

“I actually think this meeting 
went really well,” President Utsav 
Gupta said. “Thanks for staying so 
long. So props.”

The council ended its meeting 
with a spirited rendition of “Happy 
Birthday” in honor of Gupta turn-

Events Office. According to Gupta, 
UEO has extended its influence over 
A.S. events — such as the Sun God 
Festival — in recent years. This full-
time A.S. administrative position, with 
a salary of $61,731, will help improve 
the efficiency of A.S. Concerts and 
Events operations, Gupta said.

The most contentious section of 
the budget was the list of council sti-
pends.

Campuswide Senator Katie Hall 
motioned to strike the line item fund-
ing stipends in the president’s office, 
which sparked the debate.

Without stipends, “you get an 
A.S. that has an extremely difficult 
time getting non-A.S. people to get 
involved,” Vice President of Finance 
and Resources Peter Benesch said, 
emphasizing his longstanding support 
of senatorial compensation.

Campuswide Senator Bryant Pena 
reminded councilmembers of their 
pledge to students during last winter’s 
activity-fee referendum campaign.

“We are all here because we decid-
ed we want to invest our free time in 
bettering this campus,” he said. “I’d like 
to get a stipend too. I’d like for all of us 
to get 10 grand a year … but we’re not 
in a position to do that. I supported the 
referendum so that we could put that 
money back into student activities.”

Ultimately, the amendments to 
Gupta’s proposed council stipends 
were minimal, with the final allocation 
totaling $107,520.

The council will make all remain-
ing allotments third week of Fall 
Quarter 2009, following research into 
specific line items this summer.

to back-fill some or all of the fund-
ing gap left by the proposed cuts 
for at least the 2009-10 academic 
year. However, he said this solution 
would come at the expense of other 
financial-aid recipients.

“The consequence of that is not 
just for those 46,000 students who 
are Cal Grant recipients, but for a lot 
more students who receive financial 
aid,” Vazquez said. “The amount our 
students would 
have to work and 
borrow would 
increase signifi-
cantly.”

Earlier this 
month, the UC 
Board of Regents 
voted to increase 
systemwide fees 
for the 2009-10 
academic year by 
9.3 percent. UC 
President Mark 
G. Yudof defend-
ed the increases, 
which amount to an additional $662 
per student, by claiming that a new 
program called the Blue and Gold 
Opportunity Plan — which prom-
ises to provide cover systemwide 
fees for students with household 
incomes below the state median — 
would protect the university’s most 
vulnerable students from the fee 
hikes.

However, Vazquez said he could 
not confirm that the guarantees of 
the Blue and Gold Opportunity Plan 
would remain intact in future years 
if Schwarzenegger’s proposal were 
to be passed. He said the university 
is still assessing the potential conse-

quences of Schwarzenegger’s plan.
“Longer term, as the [Cal Grant] 

program is phasing out, then the 
impact could grow,” Vasquez said. 
“So yes, it’s very troubling. There’s 
no definite answer right now in 
terms of the future beyond 2009-10 
because we will have to look at all 
the alternatives.”

UCSD College Democrats 
President Sean Quirk said 
Schwarzenegger’s plan would dra-

matically effect the 
academic experi-
ences of 250,000 
students — by 
either forcing them 
to drop out or 
severely endanger-
ing their academic 
careers.

“It would be a 
complete disas-
ter,” Quirk said. 
“The repercussions 
would be enor-
mous.”

A protest against 
the proposed cuts, organized by a 
student coalition, will be held tomor-
row at Library Walk from noon until 
2 p.m.

“The main action is to try to 
convince [Chancellor Marye Anne 
Fox] to condemn the proposed 
elimination to the Cal Grant pro-
gram,” Quirk said. “Then we’ll be 
contacting representatives, assem-
blymen and state senators who are 
going to be voting on the budget 
soon to make sure this [proposed 
cut] doesn’t happen.”

the meantime, Zhiri said the depart-
ment has begun looking into other 
possible causes of the building’s high 
breast-cancer rates.

“Even before [the report] is 
released, it is irrelevant,” Zhiri said. 
“We have been speaking with faculty 
in the science departments and they 
think it might be something else that 
hasn’t been detected. They don’t think 
that it is the EMF, but they all say they 
wouldn’t want the families to work in 
the building. We hope to have a wide 
ranging toxicological study, rather 
than wait on a very narrow report.”

Kheifets said the report is her 

highest priority and, although she is 
currently waiting on data from the 
department, hopes to conclude soon. 
However, she has made it clear from 
the beginning that she does not think 
EMF is a likely culprit in the cancer 
cases.

Environmental Health and Safety 
Director Steve Benedict was unable to 
comment by press time, but previously 
said that the university is waiting on 
Kheifets’ findings to make any major 
decisions concerning the building or 
its occupants.

the Winter Quarter A.S. activity fee 
referendum passed, allotting $2.34 
per student per quarter to the pro-
posed facility. 

Designed as a work area for envi-
ronmental organizations on cam-
pus, the center will fill the space 
previously occupied by the EDNA 
information booth, as well as the 
marketing offices located behind it. 

Construction of the center is set 
to begin in July.

Sustainability coordinator Maggie 
Souder, who will have an office in the 
new center, said she remains hopeful 
that the facility will become a model 
for other campus sustainability pro-
grams. It will include a small library, 
meeting room, department offices 
and showcase of a variety of UCSD 
research projects. 

The facility is planned for com-
pletion in fall 2009, and will be 
accessible from inside the Price 
Center Theater lobby. Its floor plan is 
modeled after other UCSD resource 
centers such as the Women’s Center 
and the LGBT Resource Center.

Sustainability Resource 
Collective President Michelle Kizner 
said that attaining a central campus 
location where environmental orga-
nizations could congregate was the 
project’s fundamental motive. 

“Most students who are involved 
in sustainability … have some sort 

of story where it was very difficult 
for them to figure out how to get 
involved,” Kizner said. “There are all 
of these [environmental] groups that 
I just didn’t know about. There’s just 
so much going on on campus that if 
you’re interested, it’s hard to be visible.” 

Green Campus — a student-led 
outreach program promoting energy 
and water efficiency on campus — will 
utilize the space to maintain a sense of 
connection among its members and 
the rest of the student body.

“One of our problems [is that] 
we can’t find a [consistent] meet-
ing room, and I think that’s a lit-
tle bit difficult in terms of getting 
a good turn-out,” Green Campus 
intern Meredith Wong said. “Just to 
have a central location will be really 
great for our club … more student 
involvement and awareness.” 

Members of the Sustainability 
Resource Collective, a student-run 
organization, secured the space for 
the center last year.

“Last Spring Quarter we went and 
made a presentation and told [the 
University Centers Advisory Board] 
about the plan and how we were 
congregating — it was a student and 
faculty effort — and the board voted, 
and they allocated us the space,” SRC 
member June Reyes said.

A.S. President Utsav Gupta said 
the council will leave the center’s 
daily operations up to the SRC staff, 

relegating its role to the provision of 
student-based oversight.

A portion of the new activity fees 
will fund the $120-a-week starting 
salaries for five student directors 
of the center who have yet to be 
appointed.

According to Reyes, the stu-
dent directors will be chosen by 
a committee of A.S. councilmem-
bers and student representatives 
from the Social and Environmental 
Sustainability Committee, a stu-
dent-run organization serving as 
an advisory committee to the A.S. 
Council on sustainability issues.

Souder — who will work along-
side the facility’s only other fac-
ulty member, sustainability analyst 
Kristin Hansen — said dialogue 
between students and administra-
tors will be key to the operation of 
the new center.

“What I would see ideally is that 
the students would come up with 
ideas that they have for change, they 
can share them [and] we can try 
to get them [approved] administra-
tively,” Souder said. “And then also 
when we have projects that we’d like 
help with, we go and say, ‘Here’s this 
opportunity, and do you guys have 
a good fit for us?’ It’s going to be a 
very two-way correspondence.”

Schwarzenegger’s been buttering up the Democrats for five and a half years now. He quickly 
shed the “governator” stigma with a 
solid bipartisan stance, playing the 
immigrant card, sidestepping touchy 
church-charged issues like gay mar-
riage and abortion and turning to the 
true-blue Kennedy candy on his arm 
when the going got rough.

Then came the budget crisis. 
Then, somehow, it got worse. To the 
horror of all Californians not filthy 
rich or already packing their bags for 
Canada, the speedo-ed elephant at 
Schwazenegger’s core — in the face of 
a gaping deficit that would bring out 
the worst in any politician — is finally 
rearing its ugly head.

This is when Democrats start kick-
ing themselves for voting Republican. 
Not that Cruz Bustamante would be 
able to blunder his way out of this 
disaster very gracefully either, but we 
could guess he might have avoided 
zapping the entire welfare program 
and killing one generation’s dreams for 
a college education in one fell swoop  
— even if it took a little begging on the 
White House lawn or some hardcore 
taxing of the upper echelon.

The latest budget-fix brainstorm 
from Schwarzenegger’s ogre-ish nog-
gin is the most terrifying threat to 
in-state higher education we’ve seen 
in our two-decade-odd lifetimes. 
According to his latest budget pro-
posal, he wants to completely phase 
out the Cal Grant program, which 
currently provides over $800 million 
to upward of 80,000 students every 
year, for all new university students 
— and cap the maximum awards for 
all those who currently receive them, 
regardless of rising tuition.

UC President Mark G. Yudof and 
the UC Board of Regents defended 
their recent tuition hike by point-
ing to the almighty Blue and Gold 
Opportunity Plan, which the university 
passed in February to ensure no family 
with an annual income under $60,000 
would have to pay a dime toward their 

childrens’ student fees. However, there 
seems to be a small crack in com-
munication between state legislators 
and California’s finest public-univer-
sity system, because according to UC 
spokesman Ricardo Vazquez, the Blue 
and Gold Opportunity Plan may not 
survive when weighted with the added 
funding void that would result from 
the elimination of the Cal Grant. So 
much for that.

California has long boasted one of 
the most enviable public-university sys-
tems in the country: attractive, highly 
competitive and — best of all — afford-
able. But it doesn’t matter how sexy a 
proximity UCSD has to Black’s Beach 
or how hot it is for science; if it takes 
private-school prices to pay for the 
meager skeleton of academics and stu-
dent services we’ll retain after the latest 
round of budget cuts, the Triton statue 
is going to be one lonely old soul come 
2010, no matter how hard he blows on 
the wrong end of his conch.

Sure, the Cal Grant cut would save 
a projected $173 million next year, 
and $450 the next, and even more the 
next. But when dwarfed next to the 
$24 billion deficit Schwarzenegger is 

all but pulling teeth to fill, the snip-
ping of all university lifelines feed-
ing into the white-collar workforce 
doesn’t seem worth the decades of 
hurt we’ll be paying for hardly a 
pebble off the debt pile. 

There’s no saying what could hap-
pen without Cal Grants; at this point 
in projections, anyone who knows 
anything is pissing himself. Let’s see 
— enrollment would plummet. The 
newly burdened student-loan sys-
tem would throw the state’s wounded 
economy even further into the red. 
When coupled with monster funding 
scoops from education and virtu-
ally every health-care program cur-
rently keeping the lower middle class 
from third worldom, the future of 
California would start to look an 
awful lot like Armageddon.

If we sat tight and looked into, 
ahem, alternative government enter-
prises, or perhaps stopped throwing 
wads of cash into a failing prison sys-
tem, the economy might have a sliver 
of a chance for survival.

But in order to cultivate the cut-
throat workforce a full recovery would 
require — not to mention employees 

that could afford housing in any of 
the sunshine state’s ridiculously priced 
urban centers — there is one facet of 
society that must be maintained at all 
costs: higher education.

Feel lucky you slipped into the 
system before the conservatives 
whipped out the big guns, because 
that satisfaction won’t last long. 
When it comes time to survey the 
damage, we’ll all be feeling the burn.

EDITORIAL

By Gabriella Capisani
Staff Writer

HIGHER EDUCATION — President 
Barack Obama’s plan to make the 
United States the best-educat-
ed nation in the world by 2020 is 
an admirable one, but it presents 
a huge problem: Not everyone can 
afford a university education. Recent 
California budget cuts will make pay-
ing for school in the Golden State 
especially difficult, leaving many to 
choose community college. In order 
to see the kind of transformation 
Obama hopes to foster, the govern-
ment must strengthen community 
colleges with federal funding.

Education builds a better-prepared 
workforce, and it’s up to the federal 
government to prioritize accesible 
schooling. Limiting affordable educa-
tion will lead to an underprepared 
state, making economic recovery even 
more ominous.

The May 19 special election includ-
ed six propositions designed to mini-
mize the $21 billion state deficit. But 
because five of those measures failed, 

funding cuts to community colleges 
have become inevitable — the system 
now stands to lose approximately $825 
million over the next 13 months. 

The California community col-
lege system estimates that it will be 
forced to reduce enrollment by over 
250,000 (more than the University 
of California’s entire enrollment) — 
unless federal fund-
ing comes to the 
rescue.

According to 
Erik Skinner, vice 
chancellor for fiscal 
policy at California 
C o m m u n i t y 
Colleges, commu-
nity colleges lost 
their cost-of-living 
adjustments for 
both 2008-09 and 
2009-10, resulting 
in a $570 million 
loss in spending power. Such a drastic 
loss in economic means has stretched 
the colleges to their breaking point. 
With extended wait lists and over-
crowded classrooms, community col-
leges need a funding surge to accom-
modate their increasing numbers. 
Instead, the continuing financial cuts 
have brought the system to the brink 
of collapse.

San Diego’s district is one of the few 
to have no current debt, but it’s still pre-
paring for a severe loss in funding due 
to budget cuts. San Diego Community 

College District Chancellor Constance 
M. Carroll said she hopes to keep 
employees by reducing annual sala-
ries, but is concerned about the nega-
tive effects students will face. More 
than 600 classes in the district have 
already been cut this year, despite a 
10 percent enrollment increase — and 
with slashed funding, Carroll expects 

the situation to get 
worse. 

Though it’s 
unlikely that 
California students 
will be denied 
admission to com-
munity colleges, as 
demand rises and 
funding plummets 
fewer will be able 
to actually enroll. 
Students on waiting 
lists have little to no 
hope of getting into 

already overcrowded classes.
According to Collegenews.com, the 

California Community College system 
alone expects an enrollment increase 
of up to 33 percent  this coming year.

California Community Colleges 
currently rely on money from both 
a depleted state general fund and 
property taxes to stay afloat — which, 
with the recession at work, will not 
be enough to meet the high demand. 
Those sources can’t provide the stable 
funding needed to guarantee higher 
education access to all who seek it, 

which is what community colleges 
were designed to do.

On May 8, Obama said more sup-
port for higher education could help 
resolve our economic crisis. He sug-
gested that someone without a col-
lege degree is almost twice as likely to 
be unemployed compared to college 
graduates, reiterating how important 
accessible higher education is — espe-
cially through community colleges. 
Federal aid for community colleges 
would provide the underprivileged 
with increased opportunities for 
upward mobility, and, in turn, would 
boost the economy as a whole. 

The Brookings Institution’s 
Metropolitan Policy Program, a non-
profit public policy organization and 
research institution, offered sugges-
tions to the Obama administration,  
hoping to increase community col-
lege affordability and accessibility. 
Brookings recommends community 
colleges rely on more federal funding. 

In his as-yet-unapproved 2010 
fiscal year budget, Obama proposed 
greater Pell Grant funding, increasing 
the maximum award from $5,350 to 
$5,550. Given that community college 
students currently receive 35 percent 
of Pell Grants, this proposal is a step in 
the right direction. But in order to alle-
viate underfunding and overcrowding, 
the administration must do more. 

If Obama plans to improve higher

Between broadcasting my breakfast choices on Twitter and watching the real-time 
feed of the governmental hearing into 
the “future of journalism,” I decided 
to take a reporter position at a small-
town newspaper. 

Yes, I’m talking about a physi-
cal paper. Subscriptions go out to 
approximately 10,000 readers, six 
days a week. It has printing presses in 
the back, for crying out loud.

For all the soon-to-be UCSD 
grads, regardless of major, the basics 
should always take precedence over 
the newest techie fads. Those who 
are bound for careers in science 
must retain the fundamental lab 
skills of pipetting, titration and the 
proper use of Bunsen burners to 
attract employers.

Even those going into technology-
based fields should have their CSS 
fundamentals intact before they can 
enter a career that builds on that ini-
tial computer knowledge.  

Yes, the paper I’ll be working for 
has an online version. No, it’s not that 
much different than the print version. 
But that doesn’t mean the commu-
nity won’t use it to take the neighbor-
hood’s pulse every week. 

Sure, when I see an article online, 
I want a graph, a related photo and 
pertinent links to previous articles. 
The demand for sophisticated pre-
sentation is growing and reporting 
has begun to encompass everything 
that traditional journalism always 
had, and more.

But working for a small-time 
paper doesn’t contradict my views 
on the future of journalism. It rein-
forces the message of media as a 
civic activity that sometimes gets 
lost when people talk about all the 
cool gizmos “new journalism” will 
come up with. 

Local news organizations are in 
a lucky position right now: They are 
the sole distributors of the informa-
tion that matters to one community.

In the rapidly evolving media 
world, many have taken up the cry of 
information distribution as a neces-
sary facet of a healthy democracy. 
While I agree wholeheartedly, it’s 
only true if it starts on what might 
seem like a microscopic scale.

At the core of every profession 
is its relation to human society; for 
that reason, evolving technologies 
will never take the place of the basic 
human connectedness required of 
any career path. 

For all the would-be doctors at 
UCSD, the same principle applies. 
Pre-med students, no matter how 
sharp their GPA, will soon learn that 
empathy and caring are essentials 
to the job. Knowing the community 
you’re treating is just as important as 
memorizing the Krebs cycle.  

Aspiring grads in any field must 
be aware of the newest innovations in 
their field, but ensure that they don’t 
forget about the original reason they 
chose to pursue that path.

So, ’09-ers, go forth and use all 
the multimedia you want — just 
don’t forget what you originally loved 
about your chosen career path.

Dear Editor,
I enjoyed the letter published in 

the Guardian on Tuesday, May 26 
entitled “A Day Without Meat Won’t 
Save the World.”

At least as far as the title goes, 
this is certainly true. Given the cur-
rent size of the human population, 
and the level of resource consump-
tion by affluent nations such as the 
United States, we may be able to 
delay but not prevent the environ-
mental, economic and social col-
lapse that our activities are causing. 

Raising meat is responsible for an 
estimated 25 percent of all land use 
and 50 percent of all water use in the 
United States. This is not surprising 
when you realize that the average 
American resident eats 11 cows, 32 
pigs and sheep, 85 turkeys and 2,600 
chickens and ducks, according to 
the United States Department of 
Agriculture.

What is even worse, over 80 per-
cent are raised by corporations in 
overcrowded, squalid conditions.  
These animals can only expect to live 
with continual suffering and prema-
ture death.  Although we would not 
wish a similar fate on anyone, these 
are the conditions under which 1 
billion people on our overcrowded 
planet are trying to survive.

There are 1 billion corporate 
grown cows on Earth, one per 
human family, all being raised to 
satisfy the unhealthy human lust 
for animal flesh. Americans con-
sume 25-fold as much as the average 
world citizen.  A capitalistic econo-
my is driven by supply and demand.  
If there is less demand, there will 
be less supply.  No profit-seeking 
organization can neglect this prin-
ciple. And all U.S. citizens can do 
their part to diminish the plight of 
mammals and birds that are raised 

for food. How? By decreasing their 
demand.

Albert Einstein said: “Nothing 
will benefit human health and 
increase the chances for survival of 
life on earth as much as the evolu-
tion to a vegetarian diet.”

 Pythagoras noted: “For as long 
as men massacre animals, they will 
kill each other.” 

Leonardo da Vinci commented: 
“The time will come when men 
such as I will look upon the murder 
of animals as they now look on the 
murder of men.” 

Leo Tolstoy concluded: “As long 
as there are slaughterhouses, there 
will be battlefields.”

Mahatma Gandhi claimed: “The 
greatness of a nation and its moral 
progress can be judged by the way 
its animals are treated.”

Thomas Edison said: “Until we 
stop harming all other living beings, 
we are still savages.”

Ben Franklin noted: “When a 
human being kills an animal for 
food, he is neglecting his own hun-
ger for justice.”

  Do you note a common theme?  
Our greatest world thinkers agree: 
For ethical, environmental, human-
itarian, health, spiritual and just 
plain commonsense reasons, we 
should all eat much less meat.

education, community colleges can-
not be left out of the picture. They 
must remain a viable, accessible option 
in the entire country, and failing to 
invest in these useful institutions will 
have extremely negative repercussions. 
Higher  unemployment and more 
unqualified workers will cause a ripple 
effect reaching far into the future.

More than ever, California com-
munity colleges should be witness-
ing an increase in funding to match 
their application overload, rather than 
losing millions of dollars. Obama’s 
budget proposal also calls for the cre-
ation of a $2.5 billion College Access 
and Completion Fund, designed to 

increase college completion rates 
among low-income students. 

In order to increase upward mobil-
ity through education, the majority of 
this new funding should be directed 
toward community colleges because 
they hold the greatest potential for 
increasing access to higher education. 

Until federal funding pulls through, 
California Community Colleges 
should — as Carroll has in the San 
Diego district — freeze hiring to avoid 
further cuts to student services. As 
integral as faculty members are to 
maintaining instructional quality, this 
is no time to increase the staff payroll; 
the focus must remain on students. 

Federal funding could provide 

community colleges with the means 
to address their increased demand. 
Obama said on May 8 that “in a 21st 
century economy where the most valu-
able skill you can sell is your knowl-
edge, education is the single best 
bet we can make — not just for our 
individual success, but for the suc-
cess of the nation as a whole.” 

If we, as a nation, hope to make 
that safe bet, we must increase 
access to education — which begins 
by providing community colleges 
with the financial resources they 
desperately need.

$Iormer member of the sugar-spun Sneaker Pimps, Chris Corner borrows from glam rock’s glittery makeup kit and bats his lashes extra hard 
for IAMX’s latest drugged-out afterparty, Kingdom of 
Welcome Addiction. Corner’s gone from dozing trip-
hop to dreaming futuristic new wave, his trembling, 
flushed falsetto newly infused with the European 
decadence of his Berlin hometown. Cutting down 
on the the electro-pop of prior efforts, “Nature of 
Inviting” is all sex-drenched, throbbing confusion: 
“Survive the golden dreams you try to escape from/ 
but you surrender to the power,” Corner moans into

7 en years late, but right on time: Method Man and Redman are at the mic again for Blackout! 2. “Underground rap, that’s what you hearin’,” the duo 
boast — and they almost convince us on “Four Minutes 
to Lockdown,” a revival jam featuring Raekwon and 
Ghostface, with Roc-A-Fella champ Bink! on produc-
tion duties. The Chef cooks up a fresh batch: “I’ll run 
with the get down/ Machete your mother/ Snatch your 
brothers/ Strap you down.” And while Bink! throws 
down tom-tom percussion with a nod to RZA, Redman 
proves yet again why he’s not Clan material: “Any boy 
get served like tennis...” Put those damn Weezy tapes 
away. But don’t trip — a couple worthy guest appear-

University Art Gallery

, t’s been two months since the last University Art Gallery exhibit, and now that the paint has dried over Mark Dean Veca’s graffiti, it’s refurbishing its walls once again. Come Friday, Mandeville’s western front will house an academic year’s worth of sculpture, paint, film and photography by the 2009-10 Masters of Visual Arts graduating class. Sprawled throughout 
the foyer’s winding rooms, the creative energy of 13 outstanding students bumps UCSD’s art 
scene to new, delightfully lopsided heights.

Last April, the grad roster’s diverse work went on 
preliminary display at the MFA Open Studios; despite 
lasting a slim six hours, the event gave the public its first 
glimpse at UCSD’s oft-overlooked artsy side. 

From that installation, the gallery has hand-
picked a sampling of its most promising scholars to 
spotlight in the year-end exhibit. And though most 
of the young artists haven’t mastered the technical 
constraints of their craft just yet, their bottomless 

imaginations compensate for pre-
mature virtuoso.

At the gallery’s cobalt-coat-
ed entrance, Gretchen Mercedes 
Gordon’s low-def silent short sets 
the tone for a collection that, as a 
whole, favors experimentation. 

Gordon places footage of a land-
ing helicopter aside a far-off island 
looming closer and closer, notably 
created for a more meditative pass-
erby. Like many other pieces on

PEOPLE UNDER THE STAIRS

W henever you find yourself in a circle of stoners, be sure to utter this leg-endary line: “When the stress burns my brain just like acid raindrops/ 
Mary Jane is the only thing that makes the 
pain stop.” If you’re hanging with the night 
crowd you’re guaranteed a round of nostalgic 
smiles and sleepy nods of approval — all 
in tribute to the Los Angeles underground’s 
chiefs of state, People Under The Stairs. 

Producer/emcees Thes One and Double 
K met in 1995 at the height of the G-Funk 
era. Their true-school collab started with an 
impromptu beat session at Martin’s Records, 
which led to the debut of The Next Step, a 
score of jazz rhythms and raw bass to the duo’s 
bottomless pit of slick wordplay. 

After intense grassroots promotion, PUTS 
finally saw the commercial release of Step in 
1998, at which point it began gathering critical 
acclaim from all corners. The pair then signed 
to San Francisco’s Om Records, where they 
completed 2000’s sophomore effort Question 
in the Form of an Answer. A short two years 
later, O.S.T. ballooned their fan base with on-
the-low single “Acid Raindrops,” an ode to the 
theraputic wonders of Mary J.

To feed their growing fan base, PUTS 
released EP ...Or Stay Tuned, a reflective col-
lection of reworked older material that per-

haps foreshadowed the four-year hiatus that 
followed. Fortunately, PUTS pulled them-
selves togther in 2006, back in the studio to 
record 20-track funk celebration Stepfather. 
Most recently, a decade after their debut, 
2008’s Fun DMC ascertains full-circle evolu-
tion, spitting rhymes over video-game blips 
and riffing on ghetto barbecues.

Solo players in their game, these two value 
consistency over currency. Each album in 
their vault capitalizes on a distinctly percus-
sion-heavy Saturday-morning-cartoon vibe 
— masterfully harkening back to the golden-
oldie crews of yore. Whether it’s their beat-
machine skills on tracks like “Blowin’ Wax” 
— a staple snare and hat beneath rippled 
bass — or their lyrical odes to the ordinary 
(“Working as a waiter, ’til midnight or even 
later/ At least they’re getting tipped/ See the 
cook is getting gypped/ Fuck a minimum 
wage he’s just another immigrant”), the duo 
has whittled their hobby to a sharp discipline. 
Bring your $5 bills, your baked comrades and 
your dancing kicks this Saturday — the Loft 
hasn’t seen a party like this before.

People Under the Stairs will perform live 
with Ugly Duckling at the Loft on May 30.

UGLY DUCKLING
O n latest release Audacity, Long Beach trio Ugly Duckling shed some of their fuzzy down to com-plete their evolution into full-
grown players in the SoCal underground, 
preening their rhymes with smooth, soul-
ful samples. 

But even with a more polished prod-
uct, these misfits still got jokes — Ugly 
Duckling never passes up a chance to poke 
fun at gangsta rappers. Nor do they shy 
from catchy hooks and crowd encourage-
ment; their opening performance will heat 
the coals.

GRADS FLUFF THEIR TECHNICOLORED FEATHERS IN FINAL HURRAH

JOSEPH HO/GUARDIAN

$ s the fierce, ballad-pounding females of ’90s lose their girlhoodcharms (see: Tori Amos), pretty 
Polly Scattergood has crossed the seas
to fill the newest smart-girl alt-rock 
slot. But, like reading your little sister’s 
scribbled diary entries, the blonde’s 
eponymous debut gets boring real 
fast. “I Hate the Way” lists off all the

flutters, all weepy and British. This

FEST APPLAUDS BUDDING CAMPUS FILMMAKERS

By Hannah Kang
Staff Writer

) ilm festivals introduce new names to the public. Sundance, Cannes, Toronto — all provided launch pads for careers that now command the world’s film 
industry.  

The Loft, likewise, was the perfect place to spotlight 
shorts from nine emerging UCSD filmmakers, labeled 
“promising” by a panel of local critics and faculty mem-
bers. The panel debated the perks 
and shortcomings of each fledgling 
feature, judging the films and lead-
ing a Q&A.  

The films ranged from 
Hallmark-card sweeteners 
(“Childlike”) to eyelid-scraping 
thrillers (“Nightmare People”), 
from documentary (“Robert Koch 
is 90”) to mockumentary (“That 
One Student Film”) and from 
animation (“Sais Black”) to stop-
motion (“Verge of Madness”). But 
the films had one thing in com-
mon: They all focused primarily, as 
panel member and ArtPower! film curator Rebecca Web 
observed, on “the effect of society, and man’s relation-
ship to it.” 

After the final showing, the panel awarded each work 
on the merits of editing, screenwriting, sound design, 
cinematography, set design, art direction, directing and 
acting. The audience voted for Best Picture, coming to an 
even split between James Song’s “Nightmare People” and 
Royce Choi’s “Juiced.” 

Silent horror film “Nightmare People” retains a bit-

ing wit despite its creepy premise, exploring the surreal 
creatures behind Fuseli’s 18th century painting, “The 
Nightmare” — mad scientists, demons and everything 
else that goes bump in the night. 

“The film was a mixture of three components: film 
history, art history and my dreams,” Song said. Winning 
awards for art direction and audio editing along with the 
coveted Best Picture title, “People”’s nuanced imagery 
evokes the glamour and drama of Hollywood’s golden 
age.

“Juiced” — Choi’s color-soaked 
investigation of natural energy — 
shared the Best Picture slot. Set 
to the commercial-length, effortless 
bounce of Feist’s “One Two Three 
Four,” the narrator inserts carrots 
into remote controls, plugs vacuums 
into pineapples and ultimately runs 
a laptop on watermelon power. 

Winning Best Script and Art 
Direction, Edward Kim’s “That 
One Student Film” is an “Office”-
inspired, autobiographical comedy, 
following an egomaniac filmmaker 
protagonist as he encounters cring-

ingly awkward people and places. 
“How did you get [your actors] to do what you wanted 

them to do?” one awe-struck member of the panel asked, 
after the screening. 

“Hold them at gunpoint,” Kim replied.
A squirtgun-wielding, fuzzy dressed Artichoke 

Collective also performed an impromptu play and pro-
vided the festival’s opening soundtrack. Stitched with 
creativity and silliness, the festival gave nine under-
graduates their first flash of the limelight.  

The films had one thing 
in common: They all 

focused primarily ... on 
“the effect of society, 

and man’s relationship 
to it.”

Tori Amos
■ Abnormally Attracted to Sin
UNIVERSAL REPUBLIC

7 ori Amos might’ve lost her costume wig collection at the end of 2007’s American Doll Posse tour, but just two years later, she seems to have a new alter 
ego — ’50s housewife and suburban mother by day, 
dominatrix/assassin/ninja/diva/evil medieval lady by 
night. Her blockbuster-length Abnormally Attracted 
to Sin chronicles this remarkable heroine’s journey 
through her garbled universe (obligatory reference to 
Neil Gaiman included). 

It’s too bad her descent into wonderland sounds 
more like the worst of a nightmarish hailstorm. The 
new sass-tastic Amos takes piano-chord half-steps in a 
chanting Crone voice, screeching “Aaaall geeeeeeeeeve” 
in a pitch that wouldn’t be out of place in a costume 
shop’s Halloween soundtrack.

“Not Dying Today” almost breaks free of the sub-
terranean slime with a jogging bass thud, interspersed 
with irreverent guitar shreds and Amos’s dipping, 
shaky wail. But the blood-pumping anthem flees with 

its tail between its legs upon the first notes of “Maybe 
California,” which contemplates a mother’s suicide. 
“From one motha to thee otha,” asserts the heroine, 
rife with melodramatic keys and cascading string 
sobs.

The ladled-on darkness does nothing to hide 
Abnormally’s dead chords and stale lyrics. Even top-
notch “Lady in Blue” — delivering the clearest of seven-
minute catcalls down a heated alleyway — is shut out in 
the cold by an overnostalgic “Lady in Red,” where a riff 
only barely threads the track together. Amos is too busy 
watching the boys play and aching for that last cigarette. 
“Wronged the right man,” she echoes, reduced to a shal-
low puddle of emotional slop. 

Tori Amos will play live at Humphrey’s by the Bay on 
July 16.

University Gallery Swaps Pop-
Art Candy for MFA Samples  

display — each given ample wall 
space — Gordon’s diptych doesn’t 
dole out immediate aesthetic satis-
faction, tempting closer exploration 
of its ambiguity. The MFA exhibit 
isn’t catering to shock-value surreal-
ism or pop art like the Veca exhibit: 
instead, viewers are more inclined 
to strain their commercial-length 
attention spans to swallow the poet-
ics of dislocation and departure 
(themes Gordon palpably manipu-
lates in her Roland Barthes-inspired 
short).

All the artists filling out the uni-
versity gallery are represented by 
only a small fraction of her more 
extensive collection. The vibrant 
collection makes for a diverse col-
lection, but avoids any intimacy and 
cohesion. Most individual pieces 
win instant allure for their sheer dis-

similarity to everything else — but 
unless you’re willing to sit around 
and scratch your chin, the novelty 
fades quickly.

In the gallery’s main fluores-
cent-white room, framed photos 
hang on otherwise spotless walls. 
Yvonne Venegas, who also works 
as a freelance photographer for the 
New York Times, SPIN and VIBE, 
provides some of the room’s larger 
pieces: in her study of an afflu-
ent Tijuana family, Venegas exam-
ines representations of wealth (tiger 
cubs, opulent frocks and brimming 
wine glasses) in different forms. 
And while the subjects naturally 
engage the onlooker with direct eye 
contact, Venegas’ intentional eye 
plays up the fact that these are two-
dimensional staged photos we’re 
ogling. 

Along the same wall, on the other 
side of an open doorway, are pixilat-
ed screenshots snapped from role-
playing game Second Life. Micha 
Cardenas’ “Becoming Dragon” stills 
are probably the most well known of 
any art project on display — view-
ers might remember them from her 
December performance at Calit2. 
For 365 hours, Cardenas quaran-
tined herself in virtual reality as 
online dragon avatar Azdel Slade. 
Though her entire stunt is reduced 
to three photos, their neon tints and 
obdurate polygons still evoke a sur-
real, mind-boggling experience. 

Committed to the gallery’s back 
recesses, however, might be its most 
visually stunning hallmark: Kael 
Greco’s 16-bit video-game glitch. At 
the start of the popular ’80s arcade 
game recorded on loop, a space jet 
skirts around asteroids and aliens, 
blasting lasers at everything in sight. 
But then the speakers crack with 
an echoing tenor, the jet multiply-
ing faster than cancer cells until the 
screen is paralyzed by overlapping 
stop-action stills.   

Overstimulating us with visual 
repetitions and possible scenarios, 
Greco’s work fans out time frames 
like an infinite deck of cards. It’s too 
rapid to follow, mesmerizing in its 
hyperanimation.

If more refined craftsmanship is 
honed anywhere in the gallery, it’s in 
Julia Westerbeke’s sculptures. Evoking 
the ’70s sculptural neo-expressionism 
of  Julian Schnabel, the bunching fig-
ures along the wall and floor trans-
form soft materials like paint and glue 
into intricate fungal art.

After all is taken in, the artis-
tic hodgepodge crammed between 
UAG’s bright corners has too much 
to say and not enough time to spell 
it all out — but thankfully, the 
grads’ vigor is enough to persuade 
a Hillcrest resident that UCSD has 
more than inhuman pre-meds in a 
spaceship library to write its science 
fiction.

Staff Writer

: hen thousands of multicolored bal-loons blossom from the roof of Carl Fredricksen’s cottage, launching both the 
house and its lone inhabitant 
into an expanse of marsh-
mallow clouds, 8-year-old 
Wilderness Explorer Russell 
takes the opportunity to grab 
shotgun. 

“Up” — Pixar’s 10th com-
puter-generated animation, 
and the first rendered in 3D 
imaging — delivers an imag-
inative take on childhood spirit, by trailing an 
old man’s lifelong quest to reach the exotic lost 
world of South America’s Paradise Falls. 

“With my Wilderness Explorer GPS, we’ll 
never get lost!” chirps Russell (voiced by 
Jordan Nagai) after the curmudgeony Carl (Ed 
Asner) reluctantly allows him into the floating 

cottage. The two proceed to watch their fail-
safe device fall out of an open window into 
the abyss of space. Such comedic vignettes 
make Pixar veteran Pete Docter’s new creation 
(following box-office success “Monsters, Inc.”) 
like licking a vanilla ice cream cone on a sum-

mer afternoon.
Docter said when he 

began to visualize the script, 
he wanted “Up” to take an 
aesthetic departure from 
Pixar’s award-winning for-
mula: studying real-life 
objects for CG-graphic ref-
erence. Instead, production 
designer Ricky Nierva and 

his team created “simplexity,” or the art of trim-
ming detail down to an essential line or two — 
without, of course, damaging Pixar’s religiously 
flawless aesthetic.

The new approach draws inspiration from 
comic-book artist Hank Ketcham (of “Dennis 
the Menace” genius) and is most apparent in 

the development of protagonist Carl, whose 
squarish face, Woody Allen glasses and three-
foot stature are a reflection of his rigid and 
defeated personality — just as young Russell’s 
plump, rounded features come to define his 
pliable naivete. 

Predictably, “Up” can’t escape the kid-
die-cartoon genre’s animal affinity. Dug (the 
whimsical tail-wagging dog) and Kevin (the 
flightless rainbow waterbird) offer a Wile E. 
Coyote and Road Runner relationship — req-
uisite comic relief to the human duo’s grand 
adventure. 

“We weren’t trying to make a realistic movie,
but something that is tangible,” Docter said. 

To this effect, “Up” capitalizes on iconic 
Disney themes like finding lost love and achiev-
ing lofty dreams to create a film of boundless 
fantasy. Set to a swelling musical score by 
Michael Giacchino (“Ratatouille,” “One Man 
Band”), the film’s dense movement — a string 
of clever dialogue within seamless animation 
— makes for a jaw-drop a minute.

Imagine the Beatles were resurrected 
and reunited (minus John Lennon), then 
played the biggest tour this stretch of 
history. Now think of the ticket sales. Chalk 
it up to living legends Fleetwood Mac to do 
just that — and make a money-racking 
comeback fiercer than Prince’s three-part 
disasterpiece. Notorious for chaotic, inter-
band romances and even spicier breakups, 
the ’70s-era superstars have since found a 
group shrink and settled their differences 
(sans “retired” Christine McVie). 

Judging from the sold-out Irvine 
show, their extended hiatus worked: The 

three-hour rock-fest blowout captured the 
old magic in all its epic glory. Lindsey 
Buckingham led the pack with ripping 
chords and solos; Stevie Nicks channeled 
mystic witch-queen with effervescent, 
unreal vocals; John McVie held up bass, 
subdued but steady, while Mick Fleetwood 
thrashed the drums like an angry 
Santa Claus. After the second rollicking 
10-minute encore — complete with a 
thundering, sweat-flinging, eyes-shut 
drum solo — Fleetwood roared in closing: 
“The Mac is baaaaack!” Three little words: 
Best. Concert. Ever. (AC)

BASEBALL — There are only four 
teams left at the Division-II College 
World Series and UCSD is one of 
them.

Facing elimination for the sec-
ond day in a row, the No. 1 Tritons 
poured on a tournament-high 
13 runs against No. 21 Dowling 
University — the same team that 
silenced UCSD in the College World 
Series’ first round — keeping nation-
al title hopes alive with a 13-1 drub-
bing of the Golden Lions on May 27. 
With the win, UCSD advances to 
face No. 3 Emporia State University 
today at noon in Cary, N.C.

“I think the biggest thing is, we 
didn’t look at this as an elimina-
tion game,” junior shortstop Vance 
Albitz said in a statement. “We didn’t 
wake up [that] morning and say, ‘We 
might lose today.’”

The win over Dowling came a 
day after the Tritons beat No. 2 West 
Chester 8-6. A strong start from red-
shirt junior Matt Rossman helped 
the Tritons post their first win at 
nationals.

In UCSD’s first matchup with 
Dowling, the Triton lineup didn’t 
get its first hit until the sixth inning, 
falling to the Golden Lions 3-1. The 
second time around, UCSD didn’t 
wait nearly as long.

With two outs in the second 
inning, senior designated hitter Matt 
Cantele broke a scoreless tie with a 
single that scored junior left fielder 
Evan Kehoe. The teams scored one 
run apiece in the fourth inning, pre-

serving UCSD’s one-run lead.
After a scoreless fifth, the Tritons 

got their leadoff man on base in 
the top of the sixth when junior 
center fielder Robert Sedin was hit 
by a pitch. But after Cantele flied 
out, Dowling’s catcher easily caught 
the speedy Sedin attempting to steal 
second base, seemingly squashing 
UCSD’s rally.

With two outs, junior catcher 
Kellen Lee drew a walk and senior 
right fielder Tim Mort singled to 
keep the inning alive. Dowling 
reliever Marc Rutledge came into the 
game looking for the inning’s final 
out, but was immediately met by five 
consecutive singles that scored six 
runs — the highest run total in an 
inning from any team in the tourna-
ment — and gave UCSD an 8-1 lead.

“We’re a very explosive offense 
when we put it all together,” head 
coach Dan O’Brien said. “When the 
guys stick to their plan, it’s a pretty 
tough lineup to pitch to.”

Playing with the big lead, senior 
starting pitcher Trevor Decker got 
three quick outs in the bottom of the 
sixth to keep UCSD on top by seven.

The Tritons added to their lead 
with runs in each of the last three 
innings, finishing the game with 
23 hits. Decker held the Golden 
Lions scoreless over the final frames, 

allowing just three hits in his com-
plete game victory. The senior pitch-
er dominated much of the game, 
sending down 10 straight Dowling 
batters during a stretch spanning 
from the fourth inning to the sev-
enth.

Decker’s strong outing came on 
the heels of another solid UCSD 
start. Against West Chester, Rossman 
was charged with five runs, but four 
of them came in the ninth inning. 
The Triton starter only gave up one 
run in the first eight innings, helping 
UCSD to an 8-6 victory.

“Regarding Trevor Decker and 
Matt Rossman’s outings, those are 
two veteran pitchers that stepped up 
and threw big ballgames when we 
needed them to, because that’s what 
great players do,” O’Brien said.

With Rossman dealing on the 
mound against West Chester, UCSD 
put together 14 hits to take an 8-1 
lead heading into the final frame.

Things got a little dicey in the 
ninth inning when West Chester 
loaded the bases with two outs in 
the top of the ninth. After Rossman 
gave up an RBI single, junior reliever 
Ryland McFadyen came in from the 
bullpen with UCSD leading 8-2 to 
notch the game’s final out.

Golden Ram freshman Matt Baer 
made the game interesting, sending 
a McFadyen pitch over the fence 
for a grand slam that cleared West 
Chester’s bench and cut UCSD’s lead 
to two runs.

Following the jarring at-bat, 
McFadyen settled down to get the 
final out on a well-hit ball to right 
field that tailed away from Mort 

before the Triton outfielder tracked 
it down to end the game.

“We played a great team and that 
was a pretty potent lineup that Matt 
[Rossman] shut down,” O’Brien said 
in a statement. “The only thing I 
could think about [after the game] is 
a month ago when Matt got hit in the 
face with a line drive and he broke 
his jaw. He just wanted to know how 
he could get back out there to pitch. 
He got back out there and shut down 
a great offensive team.”

UCSD now turns its attention to 
Emporia State — one of two teams 
left that have gone undefeated in the 

tournament. The other 3-0 team, 
Lynn University, faces Belmont 
Abbey College today at 4 p.m. 

“We’re playing the best baseball 
of the year at the right time,” O’Brien 
said. “With only four teams left in 
this tournament, we feel like there’s 
no reason why we can’t dogpile and 
be the best team in the nation at the 
Division-II level.”

Series games can be streamed live at

For three years, Kazumi Negishi was a key component of the men’s tennis team. He helped 
the Tritons earn three consecutive 
NCAA Tournament bids, including 
a program-best Final Four finish 
in 2007. Over that stretch, Negishi 
played 66 singles matches and 63 dou-
bles matches, helping UCSD reach at 
least the Sweet 16 during each post-
season trip. But entering his senior 
season in UCSD’s 2008-09 campaign, 
Negishi was asked to do something 
entirely new: lead the team. With 
the departure of Blake Meister, Eric 
Rubens and Bijan Moallemi, the 
team was much younger and needed 
Negishi to step into the void.

“Kaz has grown a lot, this year 
especially, and learned to deal with 
adversity much better,” head coach 
Eric Steidlmayer said. “He under-
stood that he needed to show these 
guys what it took to be a peren-
nial national contender: things like 
composure in matches and mental 
toughness that he has been dealing 
with his entire career here. I think 
finally toward the end of the year, 
our team started getting it, and we 
started playing better. Kaz was a big 
reason for that.”

Negishi spent his senior season at 
the top of UCSD’s ladder, occupying 
the No. 1 singles spot and teaming 
with sophomore Erik Elliott to form 
the No. 1 doubles tandem. He set the 
tone in practice for a team still learn-
ing how to win.

Despite the season’s somewhat 
slow start, the Tritons won eight of 
their last 12 matches, earning a 10th-
straight tournament selection before 
being eliminated by Hawaii Pacific 
University 5-1 in the first round.

Aside from the early West 
Regional ousting, the Tritons battled 
hard just to earn the right to extend 

their streak of postseason appear-
ances. During their furious season 
finish, the Tritons won four of their 
final five matches — all on the road 
— to reach the playoffs. Two of those 
victories were nail-biters that UCSD 
clinched in dramatic fashion, thanks 
to timely performances from a pair 
of freshmen.

“I think Samuel Ling and Jake 
Fellow could be breakout players for 
UCSD next season,” Negishi said. 
“They have really impressed me the 
most because of the clutch matches 
they have won and their competi-
tive drive to do whatever it takes to 
improve.” 

Just completing their first year 
of college tennis, Ling and Fellow 
have already proven their worth 
as Tritons. Ling came back from a 
one-set deficit to secure the winning 
point at Sonoma State University 
in UCSD’s second-to-last match on 
April 17. Fellow followed the impres-
sive comeback with a tiebreaking vic-
tory in the Tritons’ upset of UC Santa 
Cruz the next day, which sealed a 
winning season and a postseason 
berth. 

Looking back on his career, 
Negishi also reflected on how his 
senior season has been different than 
the others. 

“[In] my first three years here, 
there were plenty of upperclassmen 
that showed me the way, and I was 
just a piece of the puzzle,” Negishi 
said. “Those teams expected to win 
national titles, and it was exciting 
to be a part of that and play in 
such important matches at such a 
young stage in my career. All those 
matches have helped prepare me for 
this moment where my stories and 
experiences can help the new under-
classmen.” 

Negishi said he believes his new-

found leadership this season and rich 
set of experiences have laid the foun-
dation for a men’s tennis team that is 
ready to make a run in the national 
tournament again very soon.

Graduating as a management sci-
ence major next month, Negishi ends 
his Triton tennis career with a tre-
mendous resume. As a freshman, he 
led the team by registering 17 wins 
in doubles, and finishes his career 
with 59 victories. In his fourth year 
as a starter, Negishi boasted another 
solid record in doubles, posting a 
15-6 mark while playing all but one 
of those matches at the top spot.
