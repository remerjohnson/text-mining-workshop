RIAA, MPAA to sue file sharers 
Students at 13 college campuses targeted

By BENJAMIN BAm.m 
Staff Writer 

The Motion Picture 
Association of America has 
announced that it will begin filing 
lawsuits against individuals 
responsible for unlawfully swap-
ping movies on the Internet. 

"Illegal movie trafficking rep-
resents the greatest threat to the 
economic basis of moviemalcing in 
its 112-year history," MPAA 
President Dan Glickman said, 
speaking at UCLA during a 
planned announcement. "People 
who have been stealing our 
movies believe they are anony-
mous on the Internet and would-
n't be held responsible for their 
actions. They arc wrong." 

In November, the MPAA 
announced 750 new lawsuits tar-
geting s~dents at 13 university 
campuses, none of which are in 
the University of California sys-
tem. The recent MPAA decision 
mirrors that of the Recording 
Industry Association of America, 
which began suing individuals for 
illegally downloading music in the 
fall of last year. 

"We began filing lawsuits to 
help ste~ the onslaught of piracy 
that was devastating the record 
industry," said Jonathan Lamy, a 
spokesperson for the RIAA. 
"Thousands of jobs were being 
lost; it was having a real impact on 
the people making music. Record 
stores were closing." 

The recent crackdown on iUe-

gal file sharing has focused, in 
large part, on university students. 

"We felt it was important to 
extend our efforts to coUege cam-
puses due to the high levels of ille-
gal file sharing," Lamy said. 
"Students need to understand that 
there is a law, and [there are] con-
sequences for acting against that 
law." 

In order to file lawsuits against 
individual students, the RIM has 
subpPCnaed universities to release 
the names of those people illegal-
ly sharing files through campus 
Internet connections. 

"School is no different than a 
normal [Internet service 
provider]," Lamy said . "We

WaiTen J-Board blocks APSA funding 
Chair rejects motion urging his recusal from proceedings 

By USA MAK 
Associate News Editor 

Citing possible violations of 
three financial bylaws, the Earl 
Warren CoUegeJudicial Board has 
issued a preliminary injunction 
freezing $150 in funds initially 
promised for the UCSD Asian and 
Pacific-Islander Srudent Alliance's 
11 th-annual high !Chool confer-
ence. The debate over the confer-
ence funding also nearly resulted 
in the disqualification of Warren 
College Judicial Board Chair 
Harry Khanna from presiding over 
any related hearings of the case. 

Warren Freshman Senator 
Matt Herrick filed a grievance 
agaiRst the Warren College 
Srudent Council on Nov. 8, alleg-

ing that it had violated three of its 
bylaws in funding the APSA con-
ference that took place on Nov. 
13. Many students from various 
campus organizations volunteered 
at the conference. 

The event provided counseling 
about college application and 
admission issues for srudents from 
nearby high schools. 

The first bylaw states that the 
council "shall allocate its funds to 
serve th.e Warren College srodent 
body and to support registered 
UCSD and Warren organizations 
whose projects benefit the 
Warren community." 

The second bylaw that Herrick 
charged has been violated states 
that "WCSC shall not fund the 
following types of events: those 

that do not benefit Warren 
College students of the Warren 
community [and] those not open 
to Warren College." The final 
bylaw states that organizations 
receiving funding must name 
WCSC as a co-sponsor of the 
event, with a failure to do so 
resulting in the suspension of all 
future financial support. 

Of the three allegations, the 
Warren College Judicial Board 
found only the first one to be a 
possible bylaw violation, and 
passed a preliminary injunction 
against reimbursing APSA for the 
conference.

International enrollment 
down for third year 

Universities urge Congress to 
address visa, security issues 
By SHANNON EUOI' 

Senior Staff Writer 

The number of first-time inter-
national graduate students in 
America has decreased between 6 
and 10 percent for three consecu-
tive years, according to a new 
report released by the Council of 
Graduate Schools. 

Of the 450 institutions that are 
members of CGS, 68 percent 
reported declines in fir t- time 
international graduate student 
enrollment between 2003 and 
2004. First-time enroll ment from 
China and India decreased 8 and 4 
percent, respectively. The fields 
of life s~iences, business and engi-
neering represented the highest 
declines, while the physical sci-
ences were the only area tc show 
an increase in first-time enroll-
ment, growing 6 percent. 

The study also found that totaJ 
international graduate student 
enrollment - including first-time 
and continuing students 
decreased by 3 percent. Numbers 
for domestic graduate student 
enrollment fell by 1 to 2 percent in 
the same period 

Public and research instirutions 
showed the highest decline, at 12 
percent, while private enrollment 
fell by 3 percant. 

A seperate report in September 
showed a much greater 28-percent 
decline in the number of foreign 
applicants and an 18-percent 

decrease in admits, though the 
report stated that a higher-than-
usual number of students enrolled 
after receiving an acceptance. 

"The three primary factors 
leading to [a] decline in interna-
tional graduate applications, admits 
and enrollment are increased glob-
al competition, changing visa poli-
cies and diminished perceptions of 
the U.S. abroad," CGS President 
Debra W Stewart said. "While 
these number are distressing, the 
declines are not nearly as great as 
some had feared. It is encouraging 
that the graduate schools are bat-
tling declines by streamlining their 
admissions processes, enhancing 
their use of technology and form-
ing important international part-
nerships." 

Eighty percent of the top 25 
schools for international graduate 
student enrollment participated in 
the survey, and they showed a 9-
percent decline in first-time enroll-
ment, as opposed to the 4-percent 
decline in other schools. 

According to CGS Director of 
Research and Policy Analysis 
Heath Brown, the steeper decline 
in the top 25 schools may be corre-
lated with the fact that those 
schools enroll the most students in 
engineering programs. 

"1 think [the trend of declining 
enrollment] is especially applicable 
to engineering students because stu-

New mayor still unknown 
as ballot counts continue 

Almost two weeks after Election Day, the win-
ner of the San Diego mayoral race remains 
unknown, with 50,000 ballots remaining to be 
counted and legal challenges standing in the way 
of final election results. 

In a closely split three-way race, ballots 
backing a write-in candidate have maintained a 
tiny lead - less than half of 1 percent, or fewer 
than 2,000 votes, as of noon on Nov. 14-

. over current Mayor Dick Murphy, a Republican 
candidate seeking re-election. 

Most of the write-in ballots are expected to 
back San Diego City Councilwoman Donna 
Frye, who announced her candidacy in what 
was supposed to be a runoff election between 
Murphy and Republican challenger county 
Supervisor Ron Roberts. 

Though all precincts have been counted, 
there are still 50.000 more absentee and provi-
sional ballots remaining to be counted, according 
to th~.office of the San Diego Registrar of Voters. 

In addition, several lawsuits have challenged 
Frye's candidacy, pointing to discrepancies in 
the San Diego city charter and the municipal 
code. Though one permits write-in candidates 
in general elections, the other does not. 

The lawsuits, filed by third-party challengers, 
are "desperate tactics to thwart the will of the 
voters of San Diego," Frye stated in a campaign 
release, calling on Murphy and Roberts to 
"denounce this last-minute effort to derail the 
will of the voters and speak up for democracy." 

Water board approves 
power plant permit 

After nearly three years of conflict, environ-
mental groups and Duke Energy's South Bay 
Power Plant have reached a compromise on a 
new permit for the operation. 

Earlier in November, the San Diego Regional 
Water Quality Control Board adopted a 
renewed permit for the facility - the original, 
issued in 1996, expired in 2001. 

The new permit represents a "dramatic 
improvement," accordin~ to Gabriel Solmer, 
staff attorney for the environmental group San 
Diego Bay Keeper. It sets more stringent dis-
charge limits for certain particulates, provides 
more effective regulation of thermal discharges 
and addresses strategies to reduce the impact 
on local fish populations, Solmer said. 

The plant, which has operated in the area for 
mo~e than 40 years, . predates many modem 
enVIronmental regulations and has been criti-
cized by a coalition of environmental groups 
including Bay Keeper, Sierra Club and th~ 
Audubon Sosiety. Specifically, the groups target-
ed the faollty s aged cooling system, which they 

.«; -~ 

argued effectively sterilized up to 601 million 
gallons of bay water each day, killing wildlife. 

Sony, Ford to hold Talent 
Drive on college campuses 

Sony Pictures Digital and the Ford Motor 
Company will search for college students with the 
best delivery of famous movie and television lines 
on Nov. 15 on Library Walk. The event is part of a 
16-<:ity college tour known as the "Talent Drive:' 

Winners from each college campus will be 
flown to Los Angeles for a tour of Sony Pictures 
Studio, a red-carpet Hollywood premiere and an 
appearance in the Ford Focus "Talent Drive" short 
film, which will be posted on the tour's Web site. 

Video game company 
donates to campus Game Lab 

Sammy Studios, a Cansbad-based video game 
company, has donated $290,000 to ' UCSD's 
Experimental Game Lab at the Center for Research 
in Computing and the Arts. 

The lab, created to explore new forms of art 
and expand capacity of technologies in the 
fields of computer gaming and scientific visual-
ization, "brings a dedicated video game curricu-
lum to a nationally ranked digital media arts 
program: Sammy Studios President and CEO 
John Rowe said. 

In addition, Sammy Studios will give the lab 
free use of its game engine, which incorporates 
graphics, phYSICS and online technologies that 
are among the most widely used in the indus-
try, according to a university statement. The 
engine will be incorporated into new artistic 
programs involving graduate and undergradu-
ate students from the university's 
Interdisciplinary Computing in the Arts program, 
the fastest growing major on campus. 

Faculty to meet UK 
Parliament at conference 
University of California faculty, staff, alumni 

and students will meet with members of the 
British Parliament at an event designed to dis-
cuss the nature and importance of relationships 
between research institutions in the two coun-
tries. The event, scheduled for Nov. 18, will be 
held at the House of Commons in London. 

The dialogue will set the stage for collabora-
tive research, according to UC Berkeley profes-
sor James Vemon, who directs the univeisity's 
Center for British Studies. 

By the end of the year, more than 3,500 UC 
students will have attended UK institutions and 
more than 2,000 British students will have 
studied at the UC campuses in the last decade, 
according to a university statement.

A.S. Meeting 112 - Nov. 10,2004 

Items of Immediate 
Consideration 
ItemD 

The council passed a resolution opposing 
the possible addition of a multiethniclmul-
tiracial category to the University of 
California admissions forms. 

The change, proposed by UC Regent 
Ward Connerly, would lead to the collection 
of imprecise racial data, the resolution stat-
ed. The UC Board of Regents will discuss 
the proposal at its meeting from Nov. 17 to 
Nov. 18. 

Reports 
PresidentJenn Pae 

Pae reported that the meeting between 
the administration, the co-ops, Associated 
Students, the Graduate Student 
Association and the University Centers 
Advisory Board has proved to be very pro-
ductive. 

In a joint statement, all of .the parties 
said that they were working toward the 
common goal of "limited university con-
trol (of the co-ops) while still allowing the 
university to meet its legal and other 
obligations. " 

Vice President ExtemaJ Riga Marquez 
Marquez reported that the organizers of 

UCSD Rocle the Vote are currently compil-
ing a report that discusses the problems with 
the Nov. 2 elections. 

According to Marquez, this report will 
be sent to the San Diego Registrar of 
Voters and the Secretary of State in hopes 
of solving the problems before the next 
election. 

Commissioner of Enterprise Operations

Suits: Colleges subpoenaed for student identities

know the songs a person has ille-
gally downloaded. Once fixed, we 
asle to issue a subpoena and the 
ISP responds with a name and 
address." 

After acquiring this informa-
tion, the RIM issues a letter to the 
student notifying him or her of the 
lawsuit. 

"The student can then either 
settle the case or it will be refiled as 
a named defendant," Lamy said. 
"Settlement means that the student 
not engage in (illegal downloading) 
again plus pay monetary compen-
sation." 

The average settlement for such 
a case is approximately $3,000, 
according to Lamy. 

"Universities have been cooper-
ative," Lamy said. "This litigation 
is a means to an end ." to bring 
down the level of piracy so legiti-
mate business can compete and 
flourish." 

Some students have expressed 
outrage over the lawsuits, however. 

"It's ridiculous," Thurgood 
Marshall College senior Kelly 
Col bin said. "These rich compa-
nies shouldn't be stealing from stu-
dents. They aren't going to stop it. 
The technology is so good that 
they might need to start miling 
money in other ways. " 

Other students have expressed 
concern regarding their personal 
privacy in the dorms. 

"I find it really unsettling," 

Sixth College sophomore Laura 
Diu said. "I don't thinlc the school 
should monitor our activities or 
give out our personal information 
to anybody." 

Current UC policy forbids the 
downloading of copyrighted mate-
riab. Students found violating 
such rules could face UC discipli-
nary action, ranging from the per-
manent loss of their networle con-
nection to having their case 
referred to the Student Judiciary 
Committee . 

Last year, UCLA was among 
the universities served with a sub-
poena related to the RIAA suit.

only problem is that, in adherence 
to the bylaws, I don't think we can 
fund something lilee this. I can't let 
my opinions get in the way of the 
bylaws. " 

The main point of contention in 
Herrick v. WCSC focuses on 
whether the conference, which is 
targeted at high school students, 
actually benefi ts the Warren stu-
dent body. 

"There are approximately 40 
active members from Warren 
College on APSA at this time, [and] 
at least 20 of those members sit on 
the APSA board and the high 
school conference committees," 
Warren Student Advocate 
Charlene Cheng said during pre-
liminary hearing remarks. 

Although WCSC has funded 
this particular APSA conference in 
previous years, the financial bylaws 

Herricle cited were only passed at 
the beginning of this school year, 
according to WCSC President 
Erile Ward. Whether APSA will

year's conference will depend on 
the outcome of the final hearing. 

"I don't have a problem with the 
conference and I wouldn't have a 
problem With funding it if (last 
year's college activity fee] referen-
dum had specifically mentioned 

outreach," Ward said. "I thinle it's a 
great opportunity, but I don't know 
what students would thinlc about 
funding something that's only for 
high school students." 

Herrick also filed a motion on 
Nov. 9 requesting that Khanna step 
down from presiding over both the 
preliminary hearing on the case 
and any other potential related 
hearings. Herricle argued that, 
since Khanna was on record as sup-
porting the APSA funding, he 
could potentially act on personal 
bias. After consultation with the 
Judicial Board, Khanna denied the 
motion for his own removal, argu-
ing that he did not have a personal 
connection with the case. 

The final outcome of the case 
should be decided before Nov. 22, 
according to Herrick.

University should 
allow games of chance 

By BRIAN UICiA 
Senior Staff Writer 

Repent, ye students ofUCSD, for there is a lecherous snake in your midstl Yes sir, the 
evi ls of gambling and other "games 
of chance" have a strong following 
at UCSD, so repent before ye are 
cast into the pit of debt and destitu-
tion caused by this reckless and 
rampant mob activity! What's that 
you say~ The "gambling" that the 
university banned in spring 2004 
was not reckless, nor rampant, nor 
tied to the mob, nor involved in a 
single case of student destitution, 
but instead was the college-age 
equivalent of students frittering 
pocket change at the whack-a-mole 
at Chuck E. Cheese. Well that may 
be, but try telling that to DirectOr 
of Student Policies and Judicial 
Affairs Nicholas S. Aguilar, who 
suddenly decided earlier this year to 
apply a stringent ban on any 
UCSD event where an item of 
value is exchanged for the chance to 
win another item of value. 

From a strictly moral and/or 
legal perspective, this decision 
makes a slight amount of sense. 
After all, UCSD students have 
enough money woes from exponen-
tial rises in textbook costs and stu-
dent fees; why add to the burden by 
allowing t11em to be suckered out of 
any more money through games of 
chance? This position will win you 
points on a legal brief, but in the 
real world it reeks of hypocri>y of 
the highest order. Currently, 
UCSD students can waste plenty of 
money legally by driving 20 min-
utes to Pechanga Casino, or even as 
close as the corner drug store to 
waste a dollar on a lottery ticket for 
a game severa l hundred thousand 
times harder than guessing some-
body's P.I.N. number. Even on the 
UCSD campus, students are free to 
engage in a game of chance with 
their life by consuming the 

prepackaged food items in the 
refrigerator at Plaza Cafe. 

Of course, these are only the 
unquestionably legal games of 
chance available to UCSD students, 
and plenty of other gray area activi-
ties exist, including but not limited 
to football pools, home poker tour-
naments and that simmering vat of 
sin known as Internet gambling. So 
much for effective deterrence 
against gambling at UCSD. 

Yet despite successfully prevent-
ing rampant UCSD student gam-
bling, the spring ban on games of 

" Students are free to 
engage in a game of 

chance with their 
life by consuming the 

prepackaged food 
items in the refrigerator at 

Plaza Cafe. " 
chance is a surprisingly effective 
deterrent against student participa-
tion at UCSD. One has to realize 
that these now-banned raffles and 
bingo games are not profit-making 
enterprises, but harmless fund mis-
ers to help underfunded student 
groups get UCSD students off their 
collective asses and prevent the uni-
versity from cultivating mass social 
retardation. Games of chance offer 
one of the few remaining draws for 
UCSD students to stay involved at 
school. After aU, what reasons do 
students actually have to stay on 
campus and go to these silly events? 
Social interaction~ Sorry, Board 
Club parties and other events fre-
quented by San Diego State stu-
dents hold the monopoly there. 

Legal consumption of alcohol? 
Sorry, not allowed, better run 
downtown to a club or take your 
fake ID to Sav-on and drink alone 
in your dorm room. 

Despite the implications for 
UCSD's rapidly dimirushing social 
scene, the games of chance ban 
could be justified if it could be used 
to break up something heinous like 
a slot machine ring or bimonthly 
blood-for-money tournament. Yet 
is the ban in response to any such 
widespread evil? As much fun as it 
would be to see a sword-fighting 
tournament, it seems as if the 
actions of Student Policies and 
Judicial Affairs have no effect other 
than to administratively bitch-slap 
John Muir College Residential 
Life's practice of holding two annu-
al raffles and an annual bingo tour-
nament. (To be fair, the bingo tour-
nament is still permitted by the ban 
on games of chance if Muir ResLife 
is successfully granted a permit by 
the City of San Diego). 

We're talking about a charity 
raffle here, folks . A raffle that is 
used to raise money so the same 
kids who attend the silly raffle can 
attend other such silly events. Such 
a charity raffle is a much more 
effective fundraiser and attendance 
booster than charging admission, so 
why not let Muir ResLife have its 
fun? 

Now, before this author is del-
uged with a collection of complaints 
stating that Muir is an evil organi-
zation for breaking state law and 
that Student Policies and Judicial 
Affairs is a saint for enforcing state 
law, let us be clear on one thing: 
The current ban is one interpreta-
tion of state law, and the previous 
laissez-faire policy was another 
equally valid interpretation of state 
law. As a unit of the state, the 
University of Cali fornia essentially 
chooses its own laws.

In 2006, UCSD could receive 
state funding for a full summer 
quarter similar to those at UCLA 
UC Santa Barbara, UC Davis and 
UC Berkeley. But before concert 
acts are booked and popcorn 
machines rented, let us not forget 
the plight of the average UCSD 
student. Nevermind the already 
questionable on-campus social 
life; basic needs must come first 
- course selection, financial aid, 
housing and transportation. 

Summer session has been a 
way to relax, catch up on classes 
and experiment with subjects that 
one would hesitate to touch dur-
ing the rigors of the regular 
school year. Expanded course 
selection, and the ability to pay 
for it, would help accelerate the 
race to a degree. If students had 
more opportunities to take those 
much-needed GEs or important 
prerequisites, there would be less 
anxiety in terms of scheduling 
and class availability. 

Of course, summer session 
isn't solely geared for returning 

students. Local college-bound 
students return home to Sail 
Diego, gasp over flagging GPAs 
and graduation requirements, 
and flock to the nearest universi-
ty for credit. Additional funds for 
the summer would contribute to 
a larger course variety and more 
instructors, which would pacify 
not only desperate UCSD stu-
dents, but also these outside sam-
plers. 

Financial aid, which is the first 
prioriry for many students, keeps 
classes affordable and aCl:cssible 
not only by making them che<lp-
er, but by providing fund~ fur 
housing and sustenance. ' lotal 
scholarship money awarded to 
UCSD summer school students 
in 1999 amounted to approxi-
mately $25,523, a paltry stlln 
when compared to actual summer 
school fees, which have been ris-
ing steadily (currently $126 per 
unit according to the summer 
session Web site). 

The shuttle system is also 
needed by off-campus students 
who cannot afford to wait for

I had to go to the hospital last week. It was nothing too seri-ous, which will disappoint 
most of my readers. And, honest-
ly, it disappoints me too. When 
I'm missing several classes to 
spend four hours in the hospital, 
it should at least be for a damn 
good reason.

gotten your lab results back and,

fine hospital - so fine, in fact, 
that I've made sure to visit it twice 
since I came down to UCSD. The 
staff is friendly and knowledge-
able, the place is clean and spa-
cio~s and they keep everything 
very orderly and professional. It 's 
so nice that it almost makes me 
forget that hospitals are funda-
mentally unpleasant places to be, 
and that I only came so they'd 
give me drugs. Anyway, thanks, 
Scripps. Thanks for the tender 
loving care ... and the drugs.

contracted scarlet

and everything

reality, I merely had to wait four 
hours for confirmation that I real-
ly did have exactly what I suspect-
ed I had. 

As I was changing out of the 
hospital gown and back into my 
clothes at the end of the visit, it 
occurred to me that hospi tals are a 
bit like prisons. People who go to 
both places realize they need to go, 
and they really should go, but mey 
don't really Wll1It to go. When 
you're conunitted to both institu-

released, society looks upon you as 
"improved" and "healed," but you 
just feel a little dirty, a little violat-

Oh, and in both places, you're 

strange diseases.)

was all three Stooges, and the

sliced hal fway off my face; when I 
wasn't putting rocks up my nose, r 
was getting hives, eating poiso-

Summer: 
Programming

wasted 
contin~d from page 4 

the city buses that come every half 
hour. Anyone who has waited for 
the 34 early in the morning when 
there was no shuttle helping with 
the load will attest that the city 
bus system is often unable to 
accommodate frantic students, 
and that the crowded stops I)ear-
est campus are sometimes skipped 
entirely due to lack of space. 
Summer school students need 
transportation, especially when 
on-campus housing is limited and 
expensive. 

Also, because students are not 
always able to find summer hOllsing 
on campus, let alone afford it, pro-
grams such as concerts and dances, 
would do little to help school spirit 
as there would be a smal1 perccnt-
age of UCSD students on campus 
to enjoy the privileges. 

The university should also resist 
the urge to make summer quarter 
10 weeks long; not only would this 
\cill the point of , taking summer 
school courses, but it also would 
take away the acceleration factor 
that appeals to so many when look-
ing into courses. For instance, 
UCSD students can currently take 
up to 20 units during the summer 
sessions. 

More funding to improve 
UCSD's summer sessions would be 
more than welcome. Hopefully, the 
school wil1 devote that money to 
the things that really matter, like 
course selection, financial aid and 
transportation, instead of frittering 
it away on sparsely attended con-
certS and dances.

Gambling: University 
should interpret law favorably 

comin~d from page 4 
Occasionally this can be a good 

thing, such as the university's deci-
sion to fund the beer-swilling joke 
paper Tht KDllIII, instead of fol1ow-
ing state policy by refusing to fund 
the racist publication and arrang-
ing a public hanging for all of its 
members. Yct the university's 
choice of laws can also be a detri-
ment to students, like its decision 
to ban srudent representation 
from student hearings. The gam-
bling ban fall s somewhere in the 
middle of this spectrum, since it 
takes away a previous privilege 
UCSD students had, specifically 
the right to engage in these games 
of chance. 

'No matter what the university 
chooses to do, the point remains: 
It. does have a choice in its inter-
pretation of the law. The state of 
California chooses to give itself 
leniency as far as gambling is con-
cerned by sponsoring a state lot-
tery, so it does not take a superhu-

man stretch of the imagination to 
see that a unit of the state, the 
University of California, could 
easily allow itself to hold simple 
raffles and bingo to improve stu-
dent life on campus. In the wake 
of massive, searing budget cuts 
that all but remove the few 
remaining heartstrings of life on 
this campus, it is the only ethical 
thing to do.

Visas: Science, engineering 
students post biggest decline 

continued from page I 
dents in the engineering fields are 
simply more susceptible to enhanced 
security checlcs," Brown said. 

Brown said he also sees changes 
in U.S. visa policies as a potential 
contributor to the enrollment of 
fewer international graduate stu-
dents. 

"The mandatory interview in the 
visa process, extra security checlcs in 
high-tech research areas and the 
targeting of students from specific 
countries for extra background 
checlcs [under the Condor program] 
- I think all those playa role," 
Brown said, "I also think there's a 
p.erception and negative sentiments 
as to how welcoming the U.S. 
would be to international visirors." 

The U.S. Senate Committee on 
Foreign Relations, in a hc~ring on 
student visas, addressed the concept 
of falling international graduate stu-
dent enrollment at an Oct. 6 hearing. 

In his opening statement, 
Chairman Richard G. Lugar (R-
Ind.) aclrnowledged the importance 
of an international graduate stu-
dent presence in the United States. 

"Fostering such exposure for 
overseas visitors is vital if we hope 
to counter the distorted images of 
the United States that so many for-
eigners receive through censored 
or biased media outlets in their 
home countries," Lugar said. 

Purdue University President 
Dr. Martin C. Jischke echoed 
Lugar'S sentiments in a testimony 
before the committee. 

"Our international students are 
exceptional people who will grow 
up to become leaders in their home 
nations," J ischke said. 
"International educational exchange 
programs open a door to the world 
for our students. It is a door of 

. understanding. International enroll-
ment on our campuses ... helps to 
break down [the] stereotypes and 
misinfonnation that are the breed-
ing grounds for intolerance." 

International students also ben-
efit the American economy, Jischke 

said. In 2002-03, international stu-
dents contributed almost $12.9 bil-
lion to the U.S. economy. 

At UCSD, enrollment of inter-
national graduate students fell 3.7 
percent between 2003 and 2004, 
from 860 to 828 students, accord-
ing to the campus' Office of 
Graduate Studies and Research. 
The university also saw a 27 -per-
cent decline in international gradu-
ate applicants in the same period. 

"This [decline in applications] is 
unprecedented," Dean of 
International Education Mary 
Dhooge said. "However, the appli-
cant pool is rich enough at UCSD 
that the decline wasn't as signiti-
cane The international stuJenr 
population has continued to grow 
and has to do with the fact that we 
are a major research university with 
a major inremational reputation." 

Government agencies and 
research groups have put forth var-
ious solutions and ideas to bring 
international graduate students 
back to the United States . 

"U.S. Embassy staff must find 
ways to exped i te the visa revi cw 
process so that students are not still 
waiting for visa approval back home 
as their academic pro!,'Talll begins 
here in America," Presidenr and 
CEO of the Institute of 
International Education Allan E, 
Goodman said in his testimony. 

The CGS study found that 
graduate schools have taken their 
own measures to facilitate interna-
tional enrollment, including 
changing admissions dates, giving 
students more time to handle visa 
processes and providing counseling 
on visa processes. 

"Security must not be compro-
mised," Lugar said. "But our gov-
ernment should help our universi-
ties to remain competitive by doing 
everything it can to reduce unncc-
essary delays in evaluating and pro-
cessing student visas."

EATURES (hlM5W-. MONDAY NOVEMBER 15, 2004 
ucsp expansions prepare for 

increased enrollment 

There are currently 23,675 graduate and undergraduate students enrolled 
full-time at UCSD. According to Long Range Development Plan estimates, 
29,900 students will be attending the school by the 2020-21 school year, 
and a total of 49,700 staff, faculty and students will be on campus. This 
means more facilities will be required to accommodate everyone. 

The expansion of UCSD lies in the hands of the 
Building Advisory Committee, which oversees design, 
planning and construction. The committee is com-
posed of two-thirds students and co-chaired by a stu-
dent. 

At the moment, the committee has in the works a 
full-service post office, more diverse food offerings 
(including healthy places to eat), convenient retail ser-
vices (including a bank and hair stylist), more social 
lounge spaces, additional student events and program-
ming spaces and a student-run recruitment and reten-
tion center. 

A recently approved plan for the expansion of Price 
Center has the building area extended between 60,000 
and 85,000 gross square feet of indoor space (the size of 
half of the current Price Center). 

The expansion will occur behind the existing Price 
Center, which will require the relocation of both police 
station and the shuttle stop, according to A.S. 
Presidential Chief of Staff Jared Feldman. 

Since Price Center is at the heart of campus life, me 
administration feels it is essential to focus on adding 
beneficial resources that will fulfill the academic, con-
sumer and social needs of students. 

The Price Center Advisory Committee's idea is to 
create a subterranean level behind Price Center that 
would include both parking and space for retail stores, 
more late-night restaurants and a grocery store. The 
committee feels that such businesses are in high 
demand at UCS D. 

"The businesses will attract more people to Price 
Center and make it more of a social center to hang 
out," said A.S. PresidentJenn Pae. 

The A.S. offices will be expanded and a 24-hour 
study lounge with a computer lab, group study rooms 
and commuter student resources will be constructed for 
students' convenience. 

An alumni center is also being considered, along 
with another fitness center complete with showers, 
recreation rooms and food vendors. The committee 
reasons that this location would be advantageous to 
Sixth College students and commuters who have to trek 
farther to get to RIMAC or Main Gym in John Muir 
College. 

The committee is also in favor of building an interfaith 
center. This huilding would house the Office of Religious 
Affairs and provide a place for groups to worship and hold 

meetings. It would be funded privately, in adherence to 
the separation of church and state. Price Center develop-
ment plans will be finalized by Jan. 9, 2005, 

Student Center is currently in phase two of the 
expansion process and will continue to be renovated 
until the predicted end date of October 2006. 

The goal of Student Center expansion is to create a 
place where people can gather and socialize, but not 
feel secluded from the rest of the campus. In the past, 
students have felt that Student Center and the sur-
rounding buildings are cut off from such popular social 
hangouts as Price Center and Che Cafe. 

" East Campus will be turned into 
medical graduate school housing. 
North Campus parking lot will be 

gone and replaced with housing for 
transfer students, II 

- Jared Feldman, A.S. presidential chief of staff 

To address this complaint, contractors are attempt-
ing to improve the "park presence" and create inviting 
meeting places for people. 

Furthermore, the BAC plans to make other changes 
such as increasing the General Store area by 50 percent, 
providing interior seating at Grove Caffe, introducing a 
Thai restaurant and study lounges, improving Soft 
Reserves, renovating tlle student organization offices 
and increasing the size of new office space. In addition, 
the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, 
Queer/Questioning, Intersex Association will be given 
a larger area to set up its headquarters. 

Expansion projects are scheduled to begin within 
individual college as well. Each college was designed 
to hold 2,500 to 3,500 students, but with growing 
enrollment, a more efficient expansion program is nec-
essary. 

"Several housing projects are in the mix," Feldman 
said. "East Campus will be turned into medical gradu-

ate school housing. North Campus parking lot will be 
gone and replaced with housing for transfer snJdents." 

The growth of the school also indicates tile necessi-
ty for more parking on campus. 

"There will be no more surface structures," 
Feldman said. "They are working on a number of new 
parking strucrures. They are currently looking to turn 
the grassy knoll behind the Social Science Building into 
a leveled parking strucrure." 

RlNIAC will also be expanded in the near future. 
according to Pae, the commirtee wants to add food'Ven-
dors and retail outlets to increase the appeal of the facil-
ity. ' 

The growth projects will take time and patience. 
Expansion projects for nonacademic buildings like Price 
Center do not receive funding from the state and must 
wait to receive money from sources like Smdent Affairs, 
the chancellor's office or student-initiated referendum 
funds. 

According to UCSD's Physical Plant Services, "mod-
ernizing these buildings and providing upgrades to meet 
fire, life safety, and other code requirements are high 
campus priorities." The projects are expected to be 
completed by fall 2007.

th ink that encouraging high

Tritons take CCAA title, perfect season 
Wms over Monterey Bay, Sonoma State secure 18-0 record 
By CYNTHIA BLADE CHAVEZ 

Associate Sports Editor 

The No.2 CSD women's vol-
leyball team clinched its fir t ever' 
California Collegiate thletic 
Association title in its 3-0 (30-16, 
30-13 , 30-25) sweep of Cal State 
Monterey Bay on Nov. 12 in 

Seasi~e, Calif. T hey played their 
final match of the regular season 
on Nov. 13 against Sonoma State 
in Rohnert Park, Calif., and easily 
picked .up another 3-0 (3 1-29, 30-
21, 30-r 0) win to finish the regular 
season undefeated in the CCAA, 
going IS-0. 

The team awaits official word 
of their sched ule in the eM 
Division II Pacific Regional play-
offs, which will be held from Nov. 
IS to ov. 21. UCSD's RIMAC 
Arena is one of the ites being con-
sidered for host of the Pacific 
Regionals. 

l 'he lritons finish the season 
with a 2S- 1 overall record, their 
only loss coming against University 
of Minnesota-Duluth on Sept. 4. 
Since its loss, UCSD has been 
unstoppable, winning 19 consecu-
tive matches, including 16 sweeps. 

Cal State Monterey Bay was no 
match for the Tritons; the Otters 
posted a ,000 hitting percentage to 

CSD's .2 IS. The Tritons domi-
nated in every offensive and defen-
sive category, although Cal State 
Monterey Bay's Brittany Etchings 
had 10 kills in the 10 ing effort. 

A pair of senior outside hitters, 
Bonnie Wilson and Stacy 
Dunsmore, led the UCSD attack, 
with Wilson recording nine kills 
and seven digs and Dunsmore 
adding eight kills and 11 digs. 
Senior middle blocker Katie 
Hogan added . seven kills and two 
solo blocks. The Triton bench also 
contributed in the win, with 
sopbomore outside hitter 
Francesca Centofanti recording 
seven kills and sophomore setter 
Kimberly Adams adding II assists, 
splitting duties with senior setter 
Teresa hta, who distributed 19 
assists. 

With the playoffs looming, the 
UCSD starters played solidly in 
their final regular season match 
against Sonoma State the following 
night. Once again, the Tritons out-
hit their opponents, .367 to . L2S, 
including a huge .5 16 attack per-

Women's basketball tops USD in preseason basketball 
By KELLI PRAKASH 

Contributing Writer 

[n a preseason exhibition 
hosted by Un iversity of San 
Diego, the CSD women's bas-
ketball team bea t the Division I 
crosstown riva l Toreros, 7S-72, 
on ov. 6 at J enny Craig 
Pavilion. Despite a score that 
remained close throughout the 
game, UCSD maintained the 
lead from the ha I f. 

Both teams returned to the 
court for the start of the 2004-05 
season dea ling with the challenge 
of young rosters. The only three 
senior veteran on the Triton 
bench are forward Katie 
McGann, and centers Margaret 
Johnson and Stacy Gallagher-
Bolton , though the squad is 
weighted heavily by 10 under-
calssmen. UCSD head coach 
Judy Malone begins her 29th sea-
son with the Tritons. 

The Tritons establi shed its 
margin over USD in the first few 
minutes of the game with a 
strong first half from behind the 
three-point arc and the free-
throw line, hitting five-of-15 
attempts from downtown against 
the Torero's .143 percentage and 
sinking .77S from the foul line to 
USD's lackluster .429. The 
Tritons held a .424 shooting per-
centage through the first half, 
but were shooting more often 
than the Toreros, who had a .480 
shooting percentage, helping the 
Tritons take a 41-30 first-half 
lead. 

UCSD's offense continued its 
dominance in the second half, 
dropping two-of-five three-point 
shots, plus a .374 field-goal per-
centage combined with an 18-
for-24 record from the line to 
keep the Tritons in control. USD 
made its last stand with a strong 
second-half performance, sinking 

15-of-37 field goa ls, but only 
shooting 3-for-13 from behind 
the three-point line. 

Johnson played exceptionally 
well for the Tritons, posting 10 
rebounds, four points from the 
floor and draining 14-of-16 free 
Wows. Sophomore guard Leora 
Juster led the team in field goals, 
shooting 6-for-13 with a three-
pointer and three field goals to 
combine for 16 points. 
Sophomore forward Hillary 
Hansen and sophomore guard 
I(jm Buffum tallied 12 points 
apiece for the Tritons, including 
Buffum's team-high four three-
point shots. 

Triton defense played excep-
tionally strong against the 
Toreros' powerful dribbling 
skills. Hansen and Juster led the 
team in defensive rebounds with 
five and four, respectively. 

The greatest threat against 
the Tritions in the game was 

Torero freshman center Amber 
Sprague, who led her team with 
15 points and nine rebounds. 

The Tritons take the court 
again at the Pepsi Tip-Off Classic 
in Mankato, Minn., where UCSD 
faces UM Crookston on Nov. 19, 
then Upper, Iowa on Nov. 20. 
The Tritons first home game will 
be against Cal State Bakersfield at 
5:30 p.m. on Dec. 3 at RIMAC 
Arena. .

A fter careful consideration and discussion with my roommate, I have decided 
that the NBA needs to instate min-
imum age requirements for players 
entering the draft. 

While anyone can point out 
that some of the league's' super-
stars, like Rockets guard Tracy 
McGrady or Lakers guard Kobe 
Bryant, might not be where they 
are today had they not come 
straight from high school onto the 
professional scene, the majority of 
these sti ll-maturing athletes are 
riding their egos to insignificant 
and reduced-length careers. 

For the' la t four years, a high 
school sensation has taken the 
spotlight at the NBA draft, earning 

. the No. I pick over proven colle-
giate veterans. Most recently, the 
Magic picked up power forward 
Dwight Howard, a high school 
prospect, over Connecticut All-
American Emeka Okafor. In the 
2004 NBA draft, eight of the first 
19 picks made were high school 
graduates who had decided to 
bypass collegiate basketball in 
favor of professional seven-figure 
contracts. 

What are most of these players 
really bringing to the game? They 
are told that they will be superstars 
like Kobe, and that if they go 
straight into the NBA, they will get 
shoe deals like Cavaliers forward 
LeBron James. But how many of 
these guys actually achieve that sta-
tus? How many of the eight 2004 
draft picks do you know by name? 

The NFL has a 21-year-old 
minimum age requisite for enter-
ing the draft. This is m6re a result 
of the drastic differenc~ in size 
between a big high school player 
and the average NFL player, but 
the policy benefits the sport 
beyond its rationale: It keeps col-
lege sports interesting. 

NCAA men's basketball is not 
what it was before the NBA anft 
started picking out the premiere 
athletes. This never seems to be a 
problem when collegiate football 
bowl games start being played, 
because the collegiate arena 
becomes a sort of proving ground 
for the next generation of potential 
superstars. It's a much-needed 
middJe step between playing on a 
court against the boys and being 
ready to challenge the men. 

Without a mandatory mini-
mum age to enter the NBA draft, 
more and more basketball players 
who see themselves playing profes-
sionaUy try to meet that challenge 
prematurely, thereby stunting their 
long-term achievements in favor of 
a short-term contract. 

Even collegiate institutions 
with high-profile basketball pro-
grams, which are generally consid-
ered totally impressive for athletes 
to join, cannot offer anything close 
to a professional contract. A full-
ride athletic scholarship to a top-
ranked school just doesn't match 
up against ellorbitllllt sums of cash. 

Take, for example, Clippers 
point guard Shaun Livingston,
