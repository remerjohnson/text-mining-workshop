Unity Sweeps Election

UIIIted we st.nd: Members of the Unity slate. including Colin Parent and Eisha Christian, cheer immediately after hearing that their members will fill 22 positiuns in nat year's 
A.S. Council as fifth-place presidential candidate Noah Levin looks on. 

Dodge.Next A.S. President 
One, independents fail to 
secure executive positions 
By MATT SCHRADER 
Associate News Editor 

The Unity slate accomplished its 
goal Friday as its candidates swept 
the A.S. Council election by win-
ning an 22 races that they ran in. 

"Honestly, I wasn't expecting 
all 22 of our slate members to all 
win: said A.S. President-elect Jeff 
Dodge. "That is kind of unheard 
of, but I think it just shows that we 
are a good group of people ~nd 
that we are going to do good 
things for the A.S" 

The Unity slate, led by Dodge, 
Vice President Internal-elect Jenn 
Brown and Vice President 
Finance-elect Sam Shoostary, has 
been campaigning for almost two 
months. The members say the 
work they put into their campaign 
was their ultimate key to victory. 

"And I really felt it was just a 
matter of who could put the most 
energy and time out there: said 
Dodge. 

Dodge. who is currently the vice 
president internal for this year's 
A.S. Council, said that although he 
did not expect to win, he is hon-
ored to become the new president. 

Dodge received a total of 1,311 
votes, while Ali Yazdi, presidential 
candidate. for the One slate, 
received 665. votes, John Bwarie 
received 587, Jennifer Christine 
Villanueva Ganata received 437 
and Noah Levin received 349 votes. 

Dodge said this election has 
been a valuable learning experience. 

"The one thing I learned is that 
you have to go out and present 
yourself as who you are," he said. "If 
you go out and put on a plastic fake 
smile and shake a bunch of hands, it 
is not going to work. But if you go 
and be yourself and talk about 
things that students care about, it 
will all work out in the end." 

The vice president internal race 
was considerably doser. Brown 
received a total ofl,470 votes, while 
One slate member Shana Thakur

received 1,205 votes. 
The outcome of the election 

came as a surprise to Brown as 
well.

knew we had a chance and that I

personally had a chance," she said. 
"But especially after the Cuar.1;.m 
endorsement and everything, I really 
wasn't expecting it at al!." 

Brown said Thakur ran a very suc-
cessful campaign in the race, consider-
ing the absence of certain necessary 
factors on her slate. 

"Shana is awesome and I think she 
would have done just as good a job as 
I would," Brown said. "She put up a 
tough fight. She ran a really good elec-
tion ." 

Regardless, Thakur said she was 
surprised over the final outcome of 
the election. 

"I expected more of a mix between 
individuals," she said. UI thought certain 
members of my slate would have won." 

In addition, Thakur criticized hav-
ing slates on campus citing that they 
give an unfair advantage for those who 
are a part of them. 

"From the beginning I didn't like 
slates because qualified candidates 
actually don't have a chance to win," 
she said. "Now that the election is 
over, I would like to see at least small-
er slates." 

Thakur said she is undecided as to 
her level of participation with the A.$.-
council next year. 

Due to the lack of competition for 
the vice president finance position, 
Sam Shooshtary won with 2,213 votes, 
the most of anyone in the election. 

" I feel really great," Shoostary said. 
"I am so happy that Jeff and Jenn won." 

The vice president external posi-
tion was very close election as weI!. 
Although the One slate did not have a 
representative, independent candidate 
Ernesto Martinez came within 300 
votes of Unity candidate Dylan 
deKervor. 

DeKcrvor said the win was a justi-
fied and gratifying experience for her 
and her slate. 

"I feel like a lot of hard work paid 
off on behalf of myself and my entire 
slate." she said. "Having worked with 
everybody, I Just know how hard 
everyone worked. Coming into this, I 
knew that everybody deserved to win 
and so I feel like the entire UCSD 
community did themselves a service." 

Although both slates had commis-
siOiler of programming candidates, 
current co-Assistant Programming 
Chair Eisha Christian won by almost 
750 votes. 

"Honestly, I was not expecting 
this," she said. " I was hoping for it, but 
then I wasn't completely sure. You 
never know how elections turn out. I 
have never heard of a slate winning the 
whole thing like this." 

She said her slate's ability to work 
together this last week proved to be the 
determining factor of such success. 

"This week has been nuts, exhaust-
ing and fun," she said. Ul thought elec-
tions were going to be a lot worse, but 
I think we had a lot of awesome peo-
ple supporting each other. I couldn't 
have made it, through, without all 21 
of them." 

Four other c;ommissioners from the 
Unity slate won their respective posi-
tions. Jennifer DeCamp won for com-
missioner of academic affairs, 
Catherine Algeri won for commission-
er of communications, Colin Parent 
won for commissioner of services and 
enterprises and Kyle Biebesheimer won 
for commissioner of student advocacy. 

In addition, voter turnout was up 
over five percent from last year, bring-
ing the .number of students who voted 
up to approximately 3,700. 

Ul found out here that we hit 3,600 
or so," Biebesheimer said. " It was more 
than four percent more than what 
they were hoping for so it really pays 
that people went out, took it seriously 
and went and voted." 

The 24 percent of students who 
voted also passed both fee referen-
dums and both constitutional referen- . 
dums. By passing fee referendum o.

BRIEFLY 
Member of UC Regents Board Resigns 

UC Regents Chairwoman S. Sue Johnson 
announced Friday that S. Stephen Nakashima 
would immediately resign from the UC Board of 
Regents. 

Nakashima is reportedly stepping down 
from the post he has served in since 1989 due 
to the loss of his wife of 52 years, Sally, in July 
1999 and the stroke he suffered eight months 
ago. 

The 79-year-old Nakashima is an attorney 
from San Jose. He earned a bachelor 's degree in 
accounting from UC Berkeley and received a law 
degree from the Boalt School of Law. 

There are a total of 18 regents on the board, 
which consists of 26 members. Regents are 
appointed by the governor of California and 
serve 12-year terms. Nakashima's term was not 
set to ex pire until 2004. 

UC Task Force Assesses 
Campus Cooperation with Act 

A UC systemwide task force , which was 
formed in September 2000 to determine how 
thoroughly and accurately UC campuses were 
reporting their crime statistics, has reported 
that while campuses need ·to make some 
adjustments to how they report statistics, 
there was no deliberate under·reporting of 
c rimes. 

UC Senior Vice President for Business and 
Finance Joseph Mullinix commiSSioned the task 
force to see how well UC campuses were com-
plying with the Clery Act. 

The legislation sets forth stringent guide-
lines about how campuses should report their 
crime statistics and that those statistics be 
publicized where students, staff and faculty 
can find them. 

Several instances of over-reporting were 
. found, however. For example, at UC Davis, DUI 
offenses were reported when it was found 
unnecessary to do so. 

Also released Friday was the University of 
California's response to questions put forth by 
the U.S. Department of Education regarding 
campus compl iance with the Clery Act. The 
University of California stated that while it had 
not met every aspect of the act, it was close to 
being fully compliant. 

ScrIpps Researchers Document 
Tuna Muscle Motion 

A study currently being conducted at the 
Scripps Institution of Oceanography is examin-
ing the complex muscle system in fish, the mus-
cles credited with giving fish their swimming 
power and speed. 

Researchers have long suspected that tuna 
have the strongest system due to a concentra-
t ion of the muscle that runs from the middle of 
their bodies to their tails, giving them a thrust-
produc ing hydrofoil. ' 

Stephen Katz, Douglas Syme and Robert 
Shadwick , the researchers doing the study, have 
documented the motion of this muscle structure 
in their results, which they published in the April 
12 issue of the journal Nature. 

Shadwick and his colleagues used ultrasound 
technology to record the electrical activity of 
the muscles. Their findings may lead to a greater 
understanding qf comparative physiology and 
the evolutionary biology of fish_

Owners of killer pets are responsible for their animals' 
actions and shou ld be charged harshly 
By RYAN DARBY 
Staff Writer 

On Jan 26, Diane Whipple was vicious-
ly attacked and killed by a pair of dogs in 

th~ halls of her Sa n Francisco apartment 
building as the presa canarios' owner, Mar-
Jone Knoller, looked on. Knoller later told 
police that she did her best to stop the 
attack, yet the dogs spent approximately 
half an hour learing the victim apart. By the 
tllne they were finished, her entire body 
was ravaged with holes and her throat had 
been ripped out. 

Knoller and her husband, Robert Noel, 
cla im the attack was an accident and that 

ously owned by a pair of Pelican Bay State 
Prison '"convicts who trained the dogs to 
defend criminal operations, such as 
methamphetamine labs. These dogs were 
born, bred and trained to kill. The only rea-
son for owning such an animal is for pro-
tection or assault. Clearly, these dogs have 
acted as the latter of the two. Whether the 
owners had intended for that attack to occur 
is insignificant; if you own a dog trained to 
kill, then you should not be surprised if it 
does so. 

Most people do not know just how 
vicious these dogs are when they attack. 
They weigh over 100 pounds and are 
stronger and more ferocious than we could

Appropriately, the 

couple has been indicted 
on charges of manslaughter and of keeping 
a mischievous animal that has killed a 
huma n being. Knoller is also charged with 
second-degree murder, and I hope the jury 
convicts this woman and sentences her to 
life in prison. 

Proving that the owner of a killer dog is _ 
guilty of second-degree murder can be diffi-
cult; the prosecution must prove that the 
defendant acted with malice or a blatant dis-
regard for human life. It seems obvious to 

. me that anyone who owns such an animal

The dogs that killed Knoller were previ-

destroyed cars trying to 
reach the people inside. 

What makes them 
especially deadly is their 
bite. Most dogs will bite 
and then release. Some, 
however, do not let go; 
they will rip their victims 

to shreds. There are countless horror stories 
of vicious dogs attacking little children and 
tossing them around like rag dolls. 

Even scarier is that these dogs are so dif-
ficult to kill. When one man's cocker spaniel 
was attacked by a pit bull in my home town 

~f San Mateo, Calif., the man pounded on 
the pit bull's skull with a hammer for more 
than 20 minutes before it would let go.

BERTRAND FAN 

I went into the Guardian offices a couple weeks ago out of boredom and stumbled into 
one of the rooms. The nice people 
from the business office found 
three checks for me at about $20 
each and I thought to myself, 
"Whoa!;$60!" I quickly deposited 
them into my bank account and • 
treated myself to a Jamba Juice. 

But now that I've had some time 
to reflect on it, if I had no journal-
istic, i~tegrity whatsoever, I could 
just write random words and get 
paid for them. Luckily for me, I 
have no journalistic integrity. I did 
some 'quick math calculations and I 
get paid approximately $0.03 for 
each word that I write. ow, $0.03 
might not seem like a lot of money, 
but this sentence is worth $0.48. 
And this paragraph is worth $3.99. 

I think the irony is that the peo-
ple who write letters to the editor 
about me spend at least as much 
time as I did writing the columns, if 
not more, and they don't get paid 
anything for those. 

I don't really think they want to 
get paid, though. They'd just like 
their names up there next to their 
opinion so they can show their 
friends and say, "Look, they pub-
lished my response to that garbage 
column they printed last week." 

Now you might be thinking to 
yourself, "This columnist is just 
writing a lot of crap because he's 
ge tting paid $0.03 a word." Well, 
you're right! [ couldn't have 
expressed it better myself (consider-
ing [ did express it ~yself. but with 
the little thought bubble coming 
out of your head). But now you're 
really thinking fast, wondering if 
those parentheses were thrown in at 
the last minute just to snag an extra 
quarter. Or even that last sentence. 

You might be a bit insulted that 
I'm wasting your time just for 
quarters. Well , I need those quar-
ters. I've got bills to pay just like 
everyone else. I've got a stack of 
parking tickets on my desk and 
those things double after 21 days. 

If [ were you, I'd be expecting a 
kickback for having to read this 
column. As luck would have it, I'm 
not you, and I am getting a kick-
back. But don't act so surprised. 
You don 't think Bob Dole is talking

Forks in the Road of Grades and GPAs 
There is life to be found beyond getting high GPAs and simply getting high 
By VALERIE BURNS 
Staff Writer 

The acronym "GPA" is so trite, 
yet so intertwined in our lives as 
college students. Upon arriving at 
UCSD, a place most of us worked 
so hard to get to, one might ask if 
we should continue our Protestant 
work ethic or decide to continue 
our education alternatively. 

It is widely thought that the 
best lessons learned in college 
happen outside the classroom. It is 
also well-known that in order to 
get into an affordable graduate 
school, GPA is half the battle and 
therefore extremely important to 
potential grad students. On the 
whole at UCSD, there seem to be 
three different routes taken by stu-
dents with respect to GPA: The "C 
equals degree" route, the graduate 
school route ~nd one nestled 
between the two. 

Many students I have encoun-
tered at UCSD have chosen to go 
the "C equals degree" route and 
therefore don't stress excessively 
about squeezing every drop out of 
their GPA capability. In all hon-

the number of 
people consid-
ering suicide 
during fin als 

esty, UCSD is 
a hard school , 
and there are 
some classes 
where C's are 
hard to get. 
On the whole, 
however, I 
have found 
C's require 
little work or 
class atten-
dance. I 

week will surely 
decrease. Let's 
not pretend we 
haven't met 
people at this 
school that have 
expressed such 
scary ideas. I'm 

James Pascual/Guardian sure all of us 
mean, if 
you're drinking three to four 
nights a week and smoking large 
amounts of marijuana, I could see 
where one could justify this route. 
Otherwise, it seems very slackerish 
to take your parents' money -
let's be honest, that's most of us -
and turn right back and around 
and say "screw you" to them. 

It is easy to mask the "C equals 
degree" route with such a negative 
connotation because our society 
puts such a large emphasis on 
"being all you can be." In many 
ways, this slackerish route has 
positive effects. If more people 
subscribe to this way of thinking, 

know at least 
one person who we feared actual-
ly meant what he said. 

The "C equals degree" route 
also can be analYled more abstract-
ly. In a way, it is flipping off society 
in general, as well as the intellectual 
elitist establishment. If a large num-
ber of UCSD students began to 
take less interest in their GPA, the 
results would shed negative light on 
UCSD because our graduate school 
acceptance rate would be much 
lower. Statistics like these are often 
used to show the caliber of major 
universities such as UCSD. It 
should be kept in mind that the "C 
equals degree" route is riding dan-

gerously close to the acadel1llc pro-
bation bord~r, and for ,111 YOLI prac-
ticing slackers. YO Li I11lght Wdnt to 
sneak a few B's in then:. 

The graduate school rOlile IS 
the other prominent route takm. 
Everyone planning to COlltlnUl' 
education after college n:allZl:s the 
importance GPA plays in thm 
acceptance to gradua te school. 
Since I am a student at Rewlle 
college, the majority of my peers, 
whether they arc li beral arts or sci-
ence majors, are 110t ending tht:ir 
education at UCSD. 

For Reve lle at least, it seems 
th at most students arc merely 
beginning at UCSD because of the 
high numbrr of pre-med we have. 
UCSD as a whole has a dispropor-
tionately high number of future 
graduate students. 

With th is huge st ress added to 
what most of LIS give oLlrsdws, the 
looming expectations of graduate 
schools can often be overwhelm-
ing to students. Why docs It sccm

So what should be done? I 
don't think banning people from 
owning possibly vicious dogs is the 
answer. By nature, l'm leery of ban-
ning things outright. Besides, what 
would be done with the countless 
ones already existing? Should we 
sct aside a wildlife preserve for 
them so they can roam free? Sorry, 
but our federal government is too

condoning such behavior in the 
legal sense. The trial of the killer 
dogs occuring right now in San 
Francisco is garnering national 
attention ; everyone is waiting to 
see whether Knoller will be con-
victed of second-degrce murder. 
If she is, then hopefully dog own-
ers nationwide will be more leery 
of their dogs. If she's exonerated, 
then they can breathe a sigh of 
relief and not think twice. Think 
of all the lives that could be 
saved. 

This is not to say that there are 
not responsible dog-owners who 
have tamed their dogs. But then 
aga in , who is to say that one of 
these creatures is perfectly tame?

But it only takes 
one incident to 
prove that this is a 
vicious dog, and 
by that time, 
deadly harm may 
have been inflict-
ed upon a victim, 
and the owner is 
on his way to

hUIll,lI1 being, then it should be 
put to sleep. Period. If a dog 
attacks once, there is nothing to 
prevent it from doing so again. It

should receive no second chance. 

The second, more important 
solution is stiff punishment for 
the owners of killer dogs. If some-
one wants to buy a pi t bull, then 
more power to him. But it better 
be nailed straigh t into that per-
son's brain that if that dog attacks 
a human being, then it will be put 
to death, and he wi ll be indicted 
\\'ith a minimum cha rge 0f scc-

to Jail for a long, long time - if 
not for the rest of his life. 

, '01 prosccuting such individ-
uals to the full cxtent of thc law is 

prison. The owner Illay have been 
responsible enough to attempt 
training the dog, but if that train-
ing fai ls, then he is accountable 
for the actions of an animal he 
knew to be dangerous when he 
purchased it. 

If any of you own such dogs, 
please take this article to heart. 
Hopefully, yours is a truly docile 
creature trained to not harm a 
fl ea. If, however, it is clearly a 
menacing beast that has, at the 
very least, attempted to lash out at 
humans in the pas t, then you had 
better do something, because you 
have a major problem on your 
hands. Either way, '6eemingly 
dOCi le or blatan tly dangerous, if 
your dog attacks, injures, or kills a 
human being, then you should be 
held responsible.

I've also got to buy some bagels

an impulse buyer, I'm very insulted. 
I can't imagine Ralphs charging me 
$4.00 for a bottle of A 1 sauce. And 

The UCSO Guardian 

the sick, sad truth of it all is that I 
don't even like A 1 sauce. I just 
bought it beca use I needed a steak 
sauce. Lea and Perrins used 10 
make a really good steak sauce, but 
they changed the formula, 50 it's 
sweeter now and nowhere near as 
good. In fact, it's rather bad. 

What's good at Costco is 
smoked oysters. They sell them in 
packs of three but I finish a pack of 
three pretty damn fast . They also 
sell them at Trader Joe's but I'd 
imagine they're more expensive 
there. I think Costco is just one big 
psychological game of buying in 
bulk. Cans of Coke are sold at 
Costco in packs of 24, but they're 
the same price in Ralphs with the 
Ralphs Club discount. The thing I 
don't like about Coke is that Cali-
fornia Redemption Value thing 
they tag on you at the last minute 
- that's such a load of crap. 

Because even if I were to take the 
trouble to recycle my cans, I'm not 
go ing to go to one of those 
machines where I have to ma nually 
put in two cans and get a nickel. It 's 
not worth it. It's not even worth it 
to bring big trash bags to recycl ing 
centers and have them pay me by 
the pound. 

But back to Ralphs: What's the 
deal with stocking every product 
known to man? How come I can 
buy a 13-inch TV. a lawn chair, a 
cordless phone, matzo balls and 
flowers all in the same store? How 
many TVs has Ralphs sold, consid-

Bush Going for Broke on U.S. Budget, 
Calls Self an IIdeological Conservative' 

WASHINGTON - When the 
political cognoscenti scrutinize a 
budget like the one President 
Bush sent Congress last week, 
they skip quickly ovcr the myriad 
tables and specitic proposals. They 
couldn 't care less, for instance, 
about the $73 1 million to figh t · 
drug trafficking in South America 
or t h~ $112 million to prevent 

aCCld~l1ts on airport runways, 
which Illa), n~l'cr become law. 

"B udgets aren't about num-
bers," said SJ ld former Rep. John 
R. Ka,lch, R-Ohio, who Icft 
Cllilgress in January "ftcr six years 
as dlalrl11an of the House Budget 
Committee. "For presidcnts, bud-
b~tS arc <tbout their game pI.tn. It 's 
.I way to detine themselves." 

. The way Bush has defined 
hllnsdf In this budget, to no OIll"S 
n~al surpnse, IS as an Ideological 
conservative. He called for deep 
tax cuts that would mostly benefit 
the wealthy and that would con-
sum~ so much of the govern-
ment 's resou rces th at most 
dqxlrtmcl1ts and agencies would 

have to go on a strict diet. 
And Bush's game plan, in 

Kasich 's words, is to go for broke 
this year, to try to get his full $1.6 
trillion, 10-year tax cut now, while 
his party controls both houses of 
Congress and while he is still in 
his honeymoon period with the 
public. 0 matter that two-thirds 
of the tax cuts would occur after 
2006, and the budget says almost 
nothing abo ut how spending 
would be reduced in those years. 

"This is his best shot, this 
yea r," said former Rep. Mickey 
Edwards, R-Okla ., who now 
teaches at Harvard. "Who knows 
how long they will control the 
Senate? He's got this window of . 
opportunity to win in both hous-
es, and he doesn't know if that 's 
going to contiQue." 

Another Bush ally, Damon 
Ansell , vice president fo r policy at 
Americans for Tax Reform, a CO\1-
servative lobby, said, "The honey-
moon period allows you to do 
things you can't do after the fault 
lines appear." 

A delicate point that the 
Republican majority in the 
Senate may not even last out the 
year. Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-
S.C., is 98 and clearly failing. Ifhe 
dies or becomes incapacitated, 
the Democratic governor of 
South Carolina, Jim Hodges, 
would doubtless name a 
Democrat to replace him . The 
50-50 Senate with Vice President 
Dick Cheney breaking tie votes 
would become 51-49 
Democratic. Bush's goal is to sign 
a tax bill by summer. 

"He's a president in a hurry 
who has to deal with the tenuous 
si tuation in the Senate," said Gene 
Sperling, a top economic and 
political adviser in the Clinton 
White House. "Their time in con-
trol of the government could be 
short , and virtually everything is 
designed around this one vast, 
hard push to get all their tax cut 
immediately."

Little Sympathy or Remedy 
for Inmates Who Are Raped 

f'RESr--:O, Calif. - Eddie 
Dtllard, a prisoner at California's 
Corcoran State Prison, knew what 
was In store the instant he heard 
who his new cellmate was to be: 
Wayne Robertson, a 230-pound 
sexual predator. 

Two years ear lier, the men 
had fought after Dillard rejected 
Robe rtson 's sexua l advances. 
And Dillard, a 120-pound 
IIlmate serving time for assau lt, 
had been worried enough about 
fu ture encoun ters to put 
Robertson's name on a list of 
enemies with whom he should 
not sha re a cell. 

But on Friday, March 5, 1993, 
Dillard was moved into 
Robertson 's cell. On Saturday, 
Dillard was raped. Robertson , 
who is serving life without parole 
fo r murder, testified that he 
sodomized Dillard "a ll night 
long." 

On Sunday, Robertson raped 
him again. On Monday, 
Robertson was taken to a hearing, 
and when the cell door was 
opened for his return, Dillard ran 
out and refused to re-enter the 
cel l. 

Inmate rape has such an estab-
lished place in the mythology of 
prison that references to confine-
ment often ca ll forth jokes about 
sexual assault. 

But while rape is accepted as a 
fact of prison life, the subject has 
received Itttle serious attention 
and legal remedies are rare. Few

prison rapists are ever prosecuted, 
and most prisons provide little 
counseling or medical attention 
for rape victims, or help in pre-
venting such attacks. 

The widespread social reluc-
tance to address the issue is rein-
forced by many legal constraints. 
The Prison Litigation Reform 
Act of 1996 made it far more dif-
ficult fo r inmates to challenge 
the conditio ns of their confine-
ment. 

And the legal standards for 
prisons' liability create a perverse 
incentive for guards to ignore the 
problem. Generally, prison offi-
cials can only be held liable for an 
assault if they had knowledge of a 
substantial risk to a prisoner and 
ignored it. 

"Many inmates find that when 
they try to report a rape, the 
guards don 't want to hear it," said 
Joanne Mariner, a lawyer at 
Human Rights Watch, who 
recently completed a study of 
prison rape, to be released on 
Thursday. "They tell them to act 
like a man, to deal with the prob-
lem themselves." 

With 2 million Americans 
inca rcerated nationwide, only 
Texas, Ohio, Florida, Illinois and 
the Federal Bureau of Prisons 
reported more than 50 sexual 
assaults a year in response to a 
Human Rights Watch request for 
information. 

But one study of inmates in 
seven men's prisons in four states 

room only on Saturday, at about 3 
a.m., when security guards left 
peacefully after being confronted 
with a court order. 

By early morning, officials had 
met with the station's employees and 
taken 42 resignations, including 
those of 10 journalists and at least 
five anchors. 

They also found that technicians 
had diverted TV's broadcast signal 
to another arm of Gusinsky's 
empire, the regional broadcaster 
TNT, and to TV6, a Moscow chan-

- published in the December 
issue of The Prison Journal, an 
academic quarterly - found that 
21 percent of the prisoners 
reported at least one episode of 
forced sexual contact since being 
incarcerated, and at least 7 per-
cent reported that they had been 
raped. 

The Dillard case is one of the 
few to come to public attention. 
Dillard's court papers charge that 
prison guards set up the rape, 
transferring him into the cell of 
Robertson, known as "The Booty 
Sandit: to punish him for kicking 
another guard. 

"They knew Dillard was my 
enemy, and they knew who I was: 
Robertson said. "They put Dillard 
in for something to happen to 
him." 

The four accused guards were 
acquitted in a 1999 criminal trial. 

Dillard is now out "f prison, 
living with his wife and two chil-
dren in California. His civil law-
suit against the guards is sched-
uled for trial in U.S. District 
Court in Fresno, Calif., in 
January. If he wins, prisoners' 
rights advocates believe it could 
open the door for other such 
cases. 

The consequences of prison 
rape go beyond immediate physi-
cal injuries. Some inmates con-
tract AIDS through rape.

Lives of Workers Held 
Cheap in Bangladesh 

NARSINGDI, Bangladesh -
The fire in the garment factory 
began on the fourth floor, where 
polo shirts, neatly folded in boxes, 
made a fine feast for the hungry 
flames. 

The factory's 1,250 workers 
scampered for their lives, most of 
them hurrying t.O the stairway 
that led to the main exit. There, at 
the bottom, was a gate. It was 
locked. 

In pa n ic, the trapped people 
spun around, rushing back up the 
steps, COlliding with those 
descending. 

Some people fell and were 
trampled . That is how nearly all of 
the fire's 52 victims died, their 
final breaths trampled out of them 
on the hard concrete of the teem-
ing steps. Most were young 
women: Ten were children. 

What Bangladesh has to offer 
the global economy is some of the 
world 's cheapest labor - and 
what this impoverished nation 
has received in return is the eco-
nomic boost of a $4.3 billion 
apparel industry, the full er pock-
ets that come with 1.5 million 
jobs and the horrors that arise 
from 3,300 inadequately regulated 
garment factories, some of which 
may be among the worst sweat-
shops ever to taunt the human 
conscience. 

In the days after the blaze, out-
raged politicians demanded 
accountability for the senseless 
deaths. 

Such hand wringing in a fire's 
aftermath is by now a studied rit-
ual. Bangladesh's garment indus-
try is barely 15 years old, but the 
business has ' grown so rapidly 
that it accounts for 76 percent of 

Cincinnati: 
Three days of wring 
took place this week 
ContInued from ..... 1 
ing, considering that it was a 
balmy weekend night when peqple 
enjoy going out. Sixteen juveniles 
were also arrested. 

As the city labored to restore 
order, the Public Safety Director, 
Kent Ryan, announced his resig-
nation for health reasons. Ryan 
has been widely criticized by black 
politicians and church leaders 
who charge that the city has toler-
ated racial profiling of blacks by 
the police. 

No successor was announced. 
But Mayor Charlie Luken said thl! 
resignation presented "an oppor-
tunity for us to respond to citi-
zens' concerns about police-com-
munity relations." Blacks who are 
suing the city in federal court over 
the reported racial profiling have 
called for other resignations as 

charged that the network, known for 
its critical reporting, would become 
a victim of a Kremlin campaign to 
suppress powerful dissenting voices. 

NTV is the only one of Russia's 
three television networks that is not 
owned or effectively controlled by 
the government. Its supporters say 
that Gazprom, which is 38 percent 
owned by the state and has exceed-
ingly close ties to the Kremlin, will 
serve as a conduit for government 
influence over its news programs. 

On Saturday, Boris Jordan, the 

the nation's exports. The 'number 
of manufacturers continues to 
multiply, as do the recurring 
nightmares: Since 1995, there 
have been 30 fires, with 17 involv-
ing fatalities, according to one 
labor group that has maintained a 
list. 

The post-tragedy ritual is not a 
prolonged one, however. Reports 
of investigators are expediently 
moved along the bureaucracy's 
chain of command a nd then 
seemingly into oblivion. 

Bangladesh 's garment facto-
ries run a gamut. $om seem 
models of progressive manage-
ment, with health clinics, day-
care centers and brightly lighted 
lunchrooms; workers wear surgi-
cal masks to screen out fibers in 
the air; and shiny red fire extin-
guishers hug the walls at regular 
intervals. 

Other factor ies are bleak, 
stutry places with cramped aisles 
tha't dead-end into haphaza rd 
heaps of fabric; guards are sta-
tioned at locked gates; and fire 
prevention largely co nsists of 
empty red water pails. 

Recently, the biggest force for 
reform has come from big retail-
ers worried about the bottom 
line. 

Some, like Gap and Wal-Mart, 
were embarrassed by links to 
Third-World sweatshops. 

Some major companies now 
issue codes of conduct and send 
inspectors into thei r suppliers' 
factories to enforce the rules, 
counting fire exits and auditing 
overtime records.

well as new police leadership from 
outside the ranks. 

Protests and vandalism by clus-
ters of black teen-agers led to 
three days of confrontation this 
week in which the police fired tear 
gas and rubber bullets trying to 
control crowds. City officials said 
the preliminary count included 
108 fires costing more than 
$200,000 in damages, and broken 
windows in 78 businesies, most of 
them in Over-the-Rhine, a black 
neighborhood. 

Police officials said they 
planned no mass presence near 
the funeral for Timothy Thomas, 
the 19-year-old who was shot to 
death a week ago in an alley by a 
police officer pursuing him for 
previous arrest warrants. The offi-
cer, Steven Roach, 29, said he 
thought the suspect was reaching 
for a gun. But no gun was found, 
and the violence broke out two 
days later.

Seniors Make Their Final Contribution 
Senior Class Gift will fund scholarships and commemorative plaques THE BIBLE By GEOFF DIETRICH 
Staff Writer 

As many seniors prepare to 
receive their oiplomas and move on 
to- life after college, they will have 
one last opportunity to give back to 
the UCSD community through 
their class gift. UCSD's class of 
2001 is in the midst of establishing 
a scholarship fund as its final con-
tribution to UCSD. It will also 
donate plaques commemorating 
gifts given by past classes. 

"We fe lt scholarships were best; 
they go with the purpose of giving 
back: said Melissa Tsang, chair-
woman of the Senior Gift 
Campaign 2001 . 

Two .scholarships will be funded 
by donations from graduating 
seniors: Starting next year, the 
scholarships wi ll be awarded annu-
ally: One will be awarded to a 
transfer student, and the other will 
go to a graduating senior. 

The precise financial and logis-
tic criteria for each award are still 
being worked out. 

In addition to the scholarships, 
- the class of 2001 will engrave the 

names of gifts of past graduating 
classes on their respective Library 
Walk slabs. 

This year's gift is particularly 
unique, as it celebrates the philan-
thropy of past classes as well as 
providing a benefit for future stu-
dents at UCSD. 

A.S. President Doc Khaleghi 
was especially pleased with the 
choice of gifts. 

"I am one of Illany students that 

understand the profol:1nd effect 
scholarships have on a student's 
life," Khaleghi said. "I think the 
scholarships represent both giving a 
student a chance, and, for the out-
going senior, commending the stu-
dent and supporting their future." 

UCSD Student Foundation 
President Ping Yeh is partly in 
charge of organizing the gift. 

"These gifts represent an aware-
ness of how lucky we all are to 
graduate: Yeh said. "Everyone can 
playa part to make the school bet-
ter for the future." 

Fund raising for the scholar-
ships will be a joint effort between 
the UCSD Student Foundation 
and the A.S. Council. Tsang 
stressed that the scholarships are 
"not a one time deal; working with 
the Student Foundation will 
encourage the continuation of the 
scholarship in the future." 

In the coming weeks, seniors 
will be asked to contribute to the 
scholarship and gift funds. The 
campaign hopes to raise $20,000 as 
a principal investment to build the 
scholarship. 

This year, seniors have the 
opportunity to donate by phone, by 
mail and on the Web. Yeh added that 
the committee is working hard to 
develop incentives, such as dis-
counts for alumni activities, coupons 
and freebies for those who donate. 

Tsang is optimistic about the 
fund raising. 

"The idea of scholarships will 
hopefUlly incite people to donate 
more: he said. 

The two organizations are 

working hard to bener organize the 
senior gift process. Citing the 
importance of philanthropy, 
Khaleghi is determined to broaden 
involvement in the campaign. 

"It gives those leaving a chance 
to give back to the university and 
future students: Khaleghi said. 
"But there exists no institutional-
ized system. Because of this, there 
have been classes that have not had 
the awesome opportunity to partic-
ipate in a senior gift campaign." 

Khaleghi and Yeh are also work-
ing on A.S. legislation to' add conti-
nuity and structure to the Senior 
Gift process. 
. "We can't reinvent the wheel 

every year: Yeh said regarding the 
instability of past senior gift cam-
paigns. 

Although this year's campaign 
got off to a delayed start, Khaleghi 
said he was astonished by the 
freshman leadership of Tom 
Chapman and Tsang. 

"Campaigns have started late in 
the past: Khaleghi said . "It would 
obviously be beneficial if there was 
a permanent structure in place to 
have an annual senior gift." 

Yeh hopes to help maximize not 
only donations but student involve-
ment in the philanthropic process. 

Recent senior gifts have includ-
ed recycling barrels on campus and 
improvements to the nature trails 
east of RIMAC. 

The idea of a perpetual scholar-
ships was too much for the cam-
paign to turn down. 

"They are the gift that keeps on 
giving: Tsang said.

, The annual housing crund\ 1$ back and In full 
forte as hoards of UCSD students find themselves 
in need of hOUSing. Demand for off·campus hous.-
ing is especially high this year with students no 
longer guaratlteed housing for their sophomore

What does that mean to students looking for

This can be a sobering realization for students 
who have yet to begin. their quests for housing. but 
before huddling in acornef and crying about 
vt<iions of whoring themselves on a su:eet cotnet 
for shelter, they should take comfort In the fact 
that there is help available for the search, .

There are several different ways that one can go 
about finding available apartments. 

One means is the Off-Campus Housing office,

Center. At the office. students can find a plethora 
of information regarding available housing off

possibilities. . ,

town and look. intO Completes Wt" seem appeal.-

For those students who prefer to find housing 
on their own, but want to have some direction, 
they can find a wealth of information on the Web 
or In tile various free housing magazines that are 
available at the entrances of most area supermar-
kets.. These aUo\\' students to decide which com-

~The best thing to do is to just shop around

Once you find those communities, both Taylor

wait lists at properties that offer them,n James said, 
"They are a great way to secure some sort o( avail-

As is the case with people, not aU wait lists are 
created equal. 

Most complexes charge a completely refund-

range anywhere from $20 to $200. A few places,

The Recent Stock Market 
Roller Coaster is New to 
Unjaded College Investors 

I~OIZOSCOPES 

TheEditor '5500 pbox 

By BILL BURGER 
Senior Staff Writer 

It is no epiphany that money is 
tight for college students. The 
high sales of Natural lee at the 
Sav-On near campus can attest to 
that. I personally have a change 
stash in my desk that I delve into 
on Sundays in an attempt to pur-
chase the most 39-cent cheese-
burgers that I can afford. 

Because of this shortage of 
funds, students scramble to find 
money from any source possible. 
Some people subject themselves 
to scientific testing for a few extra 
dollars. Many of us have jobs to 
pay for extraneous items that 
financial aid and Mom and Dad 
don't pay for. Another popular 
place to try and find a little cash, 
at least in the last couple of years, 
has been the stock market. 

These days are now over. I'll 
admit it. Since I was a junior in 
high school, I have invested small 
to moderate amounts of money in 
the stock market, and I know that 
I am not alone. I figured , as I am 
sure that many of you did, that the 
market keeps going up and there 
is next to no risk to being in the 
market, especially the technology 
industries, where price per share 
ceilings didn't seem to exis t. 

We all made a stupid move, but 
it wasn 't entirely our fault . We

Costa Verde Village is one of 
the few area properties that has no 
wait lis t. This is due to the fact 
tha t the complex is opening up a 
new building and is leasing those 
rooms out now. 

For the most part, people get 
on wait lists and specify a certain 
month that they would like to 
move in. Since most places remain 
at capacity throughout the year, or 
close to it, they do not know when 
they will have openings until ten-
an ts give thei r 3D-day notice to 
move out. 

At that point, the people on 
wait lists are contacted and offered

time that put us in our late teens 
and early twenties, when the mar-
ket was flying to its highest levels. 
We were led to believe that the 
rules of economics didn't apply to 
us; that prices of stock shares no 
longer had anything to do with 
earnings and that the values of 
Internet companies could contin-
uously rise, even without a prod-
uct or anything resembling a prof-

rules, and we were sure that we 
were going to benefit from it. 

We were oh-so-wrong. 
What caused this misconcep-

tion that sent buyers into a fren-
zy? Ironically enough, I would say 
that the blame can most correctly 
be placed in the laps of the buyers 
themselves. 

the opening. If they like it, then it 
is theirs. If they don't, or if they 
have another apartment already, 
then the wait lis t deposit is 
refunded. 
Pric .. 

While there are places out 
there for just about any price 
range, stu~ents should be realistic 
about what they expect to pay in 
La Jolla. 

Unless you're willing to live in 
a roach motel, you should expect 
to pay somewhere between $1 ,100 
and $1 ,500 for a cozy two-bed-
room apartment. 

Before making a decision pure-
lyon price, students should also 
consider what they are getting for 
their money. For example, while 
the cheapest two-bedroom apart-
ment at The Villas of Renaissance 
costs $1 ,585, there are seveml 
benefits that come with living in 

Cheap computer trading on 
Web sites such as E-lhde has 
made other brokerage houses 
lower their per-trade prices. All of 
this has made entering the stock 
market more accessible to many 
people over the last few years. For 
most of you, this is not new infor-
mation. What most people don't 
understand, however, is the new 
dynamic that this introduces into 
the rea lm of stock trading. 

With more novice investors in 
the market trying to make a quick 
buck, two things happen. First of 
all, variances of stock prices begin 
to go way up. This is simply 
because of the fact that more peo-
ple in the market means more 
capital in the market, which in 
turn brings the possibility of big-
ger swings. 

Secondly, more novice 
investors means that the mob-like 
reactions to certain phenomena 
have an even greater effect on 
prices of stocks. 

.This is my theory, and theories 
need to be tested with empirical 
evidence, so let's take a look at the 
numbers. 

It is easy to see that the vari-
ances in the prices of the stock 
exchanges have gone up signifi-
cantly over the past few years. As 
little as five years ago, a 20-point

that community. 
The Villas of Renaissance 

offers a fitness center with free 
weights, an aerobics room, a 
sauna, four pools, four Jacuzzis 
and several activities ranging from 
movies to dances, of which are all 
included in the rent. 

"We are a very activities-based 
community," said Taylor. "We 
really like to keep things interest-
ing for the residents." . 

Some complexes also include 
some, or all, utilities in the rental 
price, something that can be very 
valuable with the current high 
prices of water and electricity. 

I n contrast to those high 
prices, Costa Verde Village offers a 
two-bedroom and two-bath 
model for a mere $1,350. Couple 
that price with a high success rate

All .. (March 21-Aprfl19) 
Before midweek, Aries, watch 

for a key official to introduce unex-
pected financial information: 
Canceled loans and temporary 
restrictions are accented. Although 
news may be negative, Aries, past 
employment or money mistakes 
can now be easily transformed into 
sound business decisions. Pay spe-
cial attention to new property 
options, government contracts or 
lucrative, short-term projects. After 
Thursday, social relations will be 
delicate: Expect increased gossip 
and fast romantic speculation. 

'.urua (April 20-May 20) 
Private love affairs or hidden 

loyalties between friends may now 
be subtly revealed, Taurus. Over the 
next few days, romantic flirtations 
will be unmistakable: Watch co-
workers and officials for small indi-
cations of emotional change. Some 
Taureans will also enter into a high-
ly passionate relationship. Remain 
open, Taurus: New relationships 
will be temporary but seductive and 
rewarding. Early next week finan-
cial restrictions are lifted, Taurus: 
Expect slow, steady changes. 

Gemini (May 21-June 21) 
Financial speculations and new 

contracts will work in your favor 
this week, Gem. Early Wednesday, 
wat.ch for a key official or govern-
ment agency to offer unique 
opportunities in promotions, 
media, advertising or management. 
Thoroughly. research all major pro-
posals, however, before mid-May: 
Employment facts, money promis-
es or public records may be tem-
porarily misleading. After Friday, 
expect a sudden burst of physical 
energy: Health, fitness and social 
optimism are now on the rise.

Tuesday, expect loved ones to leave 
behind past social · anxieties or

and minor disagreements will no 
longer create a wall of silence. 
Cancer: Openly express your ideas, 
opinions or needs and watch for 
important emotional break-
throughs. After T-hursday, small 
financial decisions may be required. 
Key issues involve short term 
investments, property management, 
repairs or renovations: Stay focused. 

Leo (July 23-Aug. 22) 
Family and clo"se social relation-

ships will now enter a brief but 
intense period of past reflection or 
confrontation. No serious or long-
lasting influences can be expected ' 
here, Leo, but do watch for loved 
ones to openly discuss recent 
events, past social loyalties or yes-

Leo: Others may now need your 
dedication and support. After 
Thursday, news from a distant rel-
ative will be pleasing: Travel plans, 
home renovations or large pur-
chases are indicated. 

VI",o (Aug. 23-Sept. 22) 
Late Tuesday, Virgo, a work 

announcement or business pro-
posal may initiate a lengthy period 
of expansion and revised career 
ambitions. Key areas of concern are 
corporate permissions, shared con-
tracts and changed job titles. 
Tuesday through Friday, watch 
financial records and business tac-
tics closely for valuable clues. Some 
Virgos, especially those born in 
August, may find that the complex 
workplace politics of the last four 
months now create unexpected 
opportunities: Stay alert.

Quick messages and new 

instructions may soon cause subtle 
but important changes in working 
relationships, Libra: Early 
Wednesday, expect key officials or 
work partners to openly discuss 
short-term plans or revised poli-
cies. Your role may be more influ-
ential than is apparent, Libra : At 
present, group success depends 
heavily on your public confidence 
and leadership abilities. Later this

When professional investors real-

they decided to buy and sell later

there is.

nities that have bcnditcd from col-

Signing the Lease 

There are several different leas-
ing opt ions available to studen ts. 

Most places offa leases ranging 
fro m month-to-mon th to full-year 
leases. For students. there may be 
nine-month leases that run from 
September to june. perfect for the 
school yea r. 

Co-signers may be necessary to 
sign the lease at some apartme nts. 
as some leases can require the 
ren ter to put down two or ev('n 
three times the mon thly rental 
price. This is why many college stu-
dents have thei r parents co-sign fo r

market that you will nct:d any time 
soon. 

I think over the past coupk of 
months we have .been taught a les-
son as to why these investors have 
th is strategy. 

The better news. for people that 
have disposable money right now. 
is that the large variances brough t 
on by novice investors many times 
lead to a market where stocks are 
priced below where they should be. 
Are we in one of these times now? 
Possibly, and if we aren't yet. I can 
al most guarantee that we will be 
soon. This sets up a great opportu-
nity fo r people to make a killing in 
the market. So if you have extra 
cash. by all means go for it. As for 
me. I think I will stick to digging 
though my change drawer.

Sweeps 
UCDavis 
The Tritons bypass the 
Aggies in the standing 
with two victories 
By ISAAC PEARLMAN 
Associate Sports Editor 

In an important two-game 
series against sixth-ranked UC 
Davis on Friday, the UCSD 
women 's softball team swept two 
games to improve its CCAA league 
record to 15-8-1, while the Aggics 
dropped to 13-& in league. 

UCSD managed only three hits 
in the first game, but two came in 
the crucial third inning. Those hits, 
combined with two Davis errors, 
gave the Tritons a 4-0 lead. UCSD 
pitcher Leea Harlan just managed 
to hold off the pow<.:rful Aggies as 
they rallied for three runs but came 
up short, 4-3. The loss was Davis 
pitcher Susan Churchwell's first 
since Februal)' 14, ending her 
nine-game winning streak. 

In the second game, UCSD 
jumped on Davis early, posting two 
runs in the first inning. The Aggies 
scored a run in the third, but Tri ton 
pitcher Christi Martinelli had no 
trouble until the sixth inning, when 
Davis had the tying runs in scoring 
position. Martinelli escaped by 
inducing a fly out to end the inning. 

Two runs in the seventh nailed 
the coffin on Davis. 

UCSD travels to Bakersfield next 
weekend for the California State 
University Bakersfield Invitational. 

Volleyball: 
UCSD's Chen invited to 
play for national team 
Continued from page 20 
30-24 score. 

To end the game, Cogorno made 
an impressive block to thwart a sure 
point and seal the victol)' with an 
exclamation point: The Leopards 
fell to 11 -16 with the loss. 

Three Triton players were in 
double digits in kills as Chen, Hite 
and junior Griffin Cogorno had 15, 
1-3 and 10 respectively. Chen 's 15 
kills were a match high . For La 
Verne, Nate Michael led the team 
in kills with 12. 

The Tritons' four seniors were 
able to end their careers on a high 
note. Although Chen's collegiate 
career is over, his volleyball endeav-
ors wi ll continue, as he was invited 
to compete for a national team 
spot. He will be joining other colle-
giate players in Colorado Spri ngs, 
Colo. after graduation to tryout for 
the United States team, which will 
compete in the World University 
Games in Beiji ng at the end of 
August. 

Although the Tritons went 0-17 
in the Mountain Pacific Sports Fed-
eration competition, they showed 
resilience against Division I powers 
such as UCLA, Pepperdine, Stanford 
and Hawaii. Throughout the season, 
they were unable to win an MPSF 
match but were..able to take games 
from No. 6 Pepperdine, No.5 Stan-

. ford and No. 3 UCLA. 
AI Scates, longtime head coach 

of UCLA and perhaps the most 
successful men 's volleyball coach 
ever, lauded the good competition 
that the Tritons provided the Bru-
ins on April 6 when UCSD took 
the first game 30-26. Scates knew 
that the Tritons were capable of 
beating any team in the MPSF. 

UCSD finished the 2001 cam-
paign with a 6-21 overall, 0-17 
MPSF record. (ts six wins came 
against Princeton, UC Santa Cruz, 
New York University, Quincy- illi-
nois, Cal Baptist and La Verne.

UCSD Women's Volleybal~ Loses Four Heavy Hitters 
Punelli, Hawes, yisser and Kueneman say good-bye as they complete their careers 
By ARVIND VASSAN 
Staff Writer 

EveI)' year, collegiate athletes 
must pack their bags and leave the 
sport they love. They may go on to 
play professionally, or coach a team, 
but the thrill of playing for their own 
school has to come to an end. This 
can be difficult at times, but also the 
thought of achieving the goals that 
they set out for at the beginning of 
their college lives can be rewarding. 

Four women will be graduating 
this upcoming year from the 
women's volleyball team here at 
l:1CSD. Les lie Punelli from Laguna 
Niguel, Calif., Shannon Hawes 
from Escalon, Calif., Kearney Viss-
er from Santa Monica , Calif., and 
Christine Kueneman from Wat-
sonville, Calif. Each has 'Ieft her 
mark on her sport and teammates, 
and will greatly be missed . 

"I have an advantage over their 
instructors," said fifth-year head 
caacl; Duncan McFarland. "They 
have them in their classes, but I had 
he privilege of really knowing these 

girls and working witl1 them for four 
years. I saw a lot of growth in these 
ladies; the way they motivated their 
teammates, the way they pushed the 
team harder during practice and 
games. The chemistI)' that they 
brought is hard to replace. 

tain, and she and Punelli really 
became a dominant two-person 
combination for the Tritons for 
these past years. 

Hawes was a red-shirt player 
her freshman year and will be grad-
uating this year with her class. 

Visser played opposite for the 
Tritons, where she excelled in all 
facets of the game. Her specialty, 
though, was digs. Her 3.07 per 
game was second on the team. 

"These girls have been here 
with me since I began my career at 
UCSD, so it's easy to have an 
attachment to them," McFarland 
said . "The gi rls showed a lot of 
poise, stepping into the collegiate 
scene and answering the challenge. 
( remember in 1997 when we won 
the NCAA Division III cha!l1pi-
onship in their opening season. (n 
1998 we finished in second place in 
the championships, so these girls 
have shown great consistency in 
their play and have left their mark 
on the whole Division Ill. 

"( truly believe that Leslie will 
end up either teaching or coaching 
a volleyball team in the future: 
McFarland continued. "She has the 
ability to reach kids on a level most 
teachers cannot. ( can honestly see 
her going in that path." 

So as another school year cul-
minates, we say good-bye to four 
athletes who can be proud to rep-
resent the Tritons spirit. They have 
excelled both on and off the court, 
which is a testament to their char-
acter and persona.

Punelli was the team captain 
this year, an all-conference player, 
and the team MVP for the 2001 
season. Her accolades are extreme-
ly impressive, mounting a record of 
101 -23 with teammate Kueneman. 
Punelli led her team in service aces 
and digs this past year, plus ranking 
in the top of the team in other cat-
egories as well. 

Peyton Manning, a once-quar-
terback fo r the University of Ten-
nessee put it well when he said, 
"Being student athletes represents 
all that is good in sports." These 
four women are evidence of that.

Diversity 
Increasing 
in Sports 

Fuhon 
Corner 

ROBERT FULTON 

O ver the past two weeks, a p ir of remarkable happen-ings took place in the 
sports world. What the two events 
have in common is that they both 
helped create more diversity in the 
melting pot of athletics. 

In Dallas: For the first time ever, 
a Chinese basketball player laced 
up his sneakers and headed to the 
court in the NBA. The BA has 
been around for over SO years yet, 
until now, no one from China has 
ever played on a BA team. 

This does not mean that profes-
sional basketball will be filled with 
people from China or that China 
will suddenly become a superpow-
er on the basketball court. This 
does, however, help to smash any 
stereotypes that may still exist. 

Aerial accidents may happen, 
accusations of stealing nuclear 
secrets may come to the front, 
China may be an oppressive, total-
Itarian, human rights-viola ting 
coun try; but in a way, it all 
becomes moot upon the placing of 
an orange ball into a cylinder 10 
feet high . 

The sports world was trans-
formed another way this weekend. 
Women's soccer, which has been 
on the map for more than a couple 
of years no\ , has finally been given 
a professional league of its own. 
Sunday was the premier of the 

. Women's United Soccer Associa-
tion . 

Just a few years ago, a group of 
the best soccer players in the world 
tore through international compe-
tition to win the World Cup. Then 
came a run in the Summer 
Olympics in Sydney; women's soc-
cer had stormed onto the scene. 

Now they have a professional 
league where their skill and athleti-
cism can be enjoyed for an entire 
season. The new league has eight 
teams, and yes, one of them - the 
Spirit - is located right here in 
San Diego. The team will play its 
home games in Torero Stadium at 
the University of San Diego. 

I hope that the league is popu·· 
lar and survives. I watched part of a 
game yesterday, and I have to say 
that there are many worse sporting 
events on television . Can anyone 
say"XFL"? 

My skepticism comes because 
the men 's league has been strug-
gling. It has decent attendance and 
a good number of season ticket 
holders, but .. atings on television 
are dismal. Americans just aren't 
IntO soccer. There were enough 
people watching Sunday's match, 
but It was on T T - not exactly a 
major network. Plus, the novelty 
will soon wear off and only the true 
fans will remain. Let's hope that 
there are enough of them out there. 
I enjoyed watching the WUSA, but 
give me the UCSD team any time. 

At UCSD, we are used to diver-
sity. For every men 's team there is a 
women's team for the same sport 
(except golf). Athletes from a vari-
ety of backgrounds compete at the 
collegiate level. 

So, there were two changes in 
the sports universe. Hopefully they 
didn't go unnoticed by everybody.

In its last week of play, the 
UCSD men's volleyball team 
took on California Baptist Uni-
versity and the University of La 
Verne, both at RIMAC Arena. 

On Wednesday the Tritons 
hosted Cal Baptist University. 
The match went to five sets as 
the o. 1 team in the ational 
Association of Intercollegiate 
Athletics pushed UCSD to the 
limit. The Tritons were down 2-1 
but pulled out crucial plays and 
rallied together in the next two 
sets to get the win over the visit-
ing Lancers. 

Senior Donald Chen led the 
way for the Tritons with 25 kills, 
helping UCS 0 to.a 19-30, 30-19, 
28-30, 30-20, 15-13 victory. 

To close out the 2001 season, 
UCSD took on La Verne in a 
nonconference match on Satur-
day night. Its matchup against La 
Verne was the second meeting 
between the two teams this sea-
son. In the first meeting, La 
Verne swept UCSD in three 
games, 30-25, 30-28, 30-23. For-
tunately, the Tritons were able to 
return the favor the second time 
around. 

On Senior ight 2001 , 
seniors Chen, Zack Hite, Kevin 
Flynn and Todd Tarplee played 
their final game in Triton uni-
forms. With a good crowd in 
attendance at RlMAC Arena, the 
four seniors made the most of 
thei r opportunities and guided 
UCSD to a commanding win 
over the top-ranked team in 
Division III.

The Tritons battled in a close 
match for three sets, but in the 
end, UCSD was just too much 
for La Verne. The first game was 
tight most of the way, but the Tri-
tons were able to break loose and 
win 30-23. 

The second game proved to 
be a more easy task than the first, 

came through with some crucial 
kills and finished the match with 
a total of seven. 

The third and final game 
proved to be similar to the first 
game. Each team had shifts in 
momentum, but eventually 
UCSD contained the Leopards 
and closed out the match with a

Women notch five 
victories over the 
weekend

Last Friday and Saturday the 
12th-nmked UCSD women's water 
polo team traveled to Long Beach 
to compete in the Long Beach Invi-
tational and went an impressive s-
O over the two days to improve to 
17-11 for the season. 

On the first day, the Tritons 
roared out of the gates with a 14-2 
pounding of Cal State Bakersfield. In 
the second game of the day, UCSD 
continued its dominating play by 
demolishing the Claremont/Mudd 
polo team, 11 -1. Freshman goalie 
Andrea Cornford was stingy in the 
net, holding the opposition to a sin-
gle goal in the first qu~rter and then 
blanking them the rest of the match 
to end with six saves. 

On Saturday the 'Tritons first 
squared off against Occidental Col-
lege and had no problem, winning 
the game 10-5. Both Emma 
Kudritzki , Courtney Hemmerly 
and Hilary Smith put in two goals. 

The second game was a bit 
tougher, as UCSD took on the 
tournament host , Long Beach 
State. Due to a stifling defense, led 
by Hubbs with eight saves, the 
Tritons were able to come out on 
top, 3-2, due to two goals from 
K1.Idritzki . The third game just 
eked out a victory over UC Santa 
Barbara, 7-6, behind the inspired 
play of Kudritzki, who tallied four 
goals in the match . 

Kudritzki was the Tritons' main 
offensive weapon throughout the 
tournament, and she finished the 
weekend with an incredible 12 
goals in five games to lead the Tri-
tons.

coach Tony Salerno. "It was inspir-
ing: 

The UCSD women had fin-

even t, except for 4xl00 relay 
events, in which the team was 
disqualified. Triton event winners 
included Meghan Scott in the

women's track and field team

UCSD Invitational, when Megan 
Bergin qualified for the NCAA 
nationals in the hammer throw at 
a San Diego State University 
meet.
