May 2, at which five applicants 
from Southern Cal ifornia and four 
from Northern California will be

Coop-Fee Referendum Set 
To Begin Next Wednesday 

Poor response has prompted 
the UC Student Body President's 
Counci l (SBPC) to extend the 

~tude nt Regent application 
dead line to today . There was a 
genera l shortage of applicants at 
many of the UC campuses on 
Sunday's deadline. UC San Diego 
had eight applicants while UC 
Davi had only five, according to 
tatewl'de external affairs 

coordinator Karen Steen tofte. 
UCSD received only two 

nomina ting commission ap-
plications . One of the two ap-
plicant will help screen student 
Regent applicants . The first 
nomina ting commission meeting 
on April 26 will review 
qua lifications for student Regent-

Steentofte said the nine 
nominees will be whittled down 
to three at the SBPC's meeting at 
UC Santa Cruz on May 9. By June 
1, a final student representative 
wi II be elected tosit on the Board 
of Regents and by JlIly 1 the

SV A Clears Up Issues in Its Stand 
by Steve White 

'or atuden1a 'or VOluntary Action 

Students for Voluntary Action 
would like to clear up a number 
of the issues surrounding our 
stand on the upcoming 
referendum, and indicate our 
reasons for them. We, too, hope 
that this will give students a 
rational basis on which to make 
up their <;?Wn minds. 

The Coop is in favor of the 
Campus Activities Fee. So are we. 
However, we simply wish to see it 
made voluntary. It is certainly 
true that this fee has helped 
accomplish many worthwhile 
things this year. But let us also 
not forget the scandals over the 
Budget Resources Group (BRG), 
and the argumentation over 
fundi ng that has characterized 
much of the Coop's financial 
dealings. No, I do not mean to say 
that this is all the Coop has done, 
but I want to pOint out that the 
issue is not one-sided, and that 
the Coop has made more than a 
few mistakes in this regard. We 
rea lize the Coop is sti ll growing, 
and may learn from these 
mistakes. However, we believe 
that each student should be able 
to decide individually whether or 
not the Coop's activities are 
worth $6 per quarter to him or 
her. If some Coop members 
believe that the Coop could not 
function without a mandatory 
fee, the opinion in the Coop is 
apparently divided about this 
issue . Stephen Lopez, a very 
active Coop member, wrote a 
letter to the Triton Times in which 
he steadfastly maintained that 
the Coop would not collapse 
without a mandatory fee. We can 
only agree with him . 

Many people still believe that 

The Coop 

"voluntary fee" means 
"donation ." It does not. It is 
obviously unfair for a student 
who pays his or her S6 to get no 
more for it than a student who 
does not pay the fee, and we 
don't advocate this. We maintain 
that those who pay the voluntary 
fee should have their registration 
cards stamped in order for them 
to continue to get in free to 
concerts, dances, etc ., exactly as 
now. Those who thought that the 
package deal thus offered was not 
worth S6 to them would be free to 
spend the money on things they 
wanted more. The Coop seeks to 
foster the student enterprises that 
the Coop believes are beneficial. 
But what about you? We believe 
that you should have the right to 
choose for yourself. 

You may have noticed that, in 
the past few weeks, there have 
been a fairly large number of 
dances and concerts and such, all 
sponsored by the Coop with 
Campus Activities Fee money. 
Also, the Coop has been much 
more visible on campus, and has 
attempted to promote its ac-
tivities to the students more. One 
of the reasons for this increased 
activity is that the Coop wants to 
justify the funds they get from the 
students . This is fine, and one 
might naively say we should have 
a referendum every quarter if this 
is its effect on this kind of 
responsiveness of those 
distributing the funds . Instead, 
we maintain that a voluntary fee 
would be an ideal method for 
insuring juH that. They would 
realize that if they didn't offer the 
kinds of activities students 
wanted, they would lose support, 
and hence they would have a 
strong tendency to be very 
responsive. 

Students for Voluntary Action 
has been widely touted as an anti-

Coop group. We are not. We 
recognize that the Coop provides 
a useful forum for students so 
inclined to VOice their views and 
work towards certai n ends . But it 
shodd be noted that the Coop is 
structured in such a way that only 
a comparatively few students are 
actually involved in its decision-
making processes . Students must 
have gone to two out of the three 
previous meetings in order to 
vote . And apparently the vast 
majority of students either simply 
cannot afford the time, or don't 
find this a worthwhile way to 
pend it. This is not necessarily a 

flaw in the Coop, but it does 
mean that the Coop, by its nature , 
6hly represents those students 
who are actually there to vote, 
and this comprises less than 2% 
of the UCSD undergraduate 
population . An elected govern-
ment might claim to represent all 
those who voted for it in an 
election, say perhaps 20% of all 
the students. But the Coop is so 
structured that it can scarcely be 
cons ide red even this represen-
tative . Thus, to hold it up as the 
representative of the UCSD 
undergraduate students seems to 
be to overlook the opinions of 
98% of these students . Coop 
members Garret Gruenof and 
Fred Speck say that the Coop 
"does not purport to represent the 
total student view, but serves 
instead as a forum for the ad-
vocacy of many student views ." 
Good . That's how it should 
remain . 

These are our views, then If, 
after thinking about them, you 
find the arguments persuasive, I 
encourage you to vote in favor of 
a - voluntary Campus Activities 
Fee, and opposed to the Coop 
becom ing the official 
representative of all UCSD un-
dergraduate students. 

White May Not Make Use of Fee 
Ann Carberry 

Member, Student Coo.,. .. ".e 
In Monday's issue of the Triton 

Times, Steve White expounded 
on the need to abandon the 
present system of student fees in 
favor of his pet system, 
"Voluntary" fees. It must be 
emphatically stressed that Mr. 
White is a GRADUATE STUDENT 
and is not directly affected by 
either the COlmpus Activity Fee or 
Coop actions. Possibly the 
gentleman does not take ad-
vanlage of the many films, 

concerts, plays, dance com-
panies, and lectures put on by the 
Campus Program Board , but 
many, many students do . Maybe 
he could care less about editorials 
and a alternative free press on 
this campus . I can't, however, 
believe that a majority of 
students would accept that view. 

The Campus Activity Fee serves 
all students who take advantage 
of those ac tivi ties. We cannot 
allow a small, vocal minority to 
destroy the activities at UCSD.

position on the upcoming 
referendum, the second half of 
that referendum was utterly 
neglected . This question deals 
with the Student Cooperative. It 
asks the students "Should the 
Student Cooperative ("Co-op") 
repre sent the UCSD un-
dergraduate communi ty on 
campus and University-wide 
affairs?" The question is directly 
addressed to students to give 
them the power to appoint their 
representatives . Students need an 
organized voice. As long as we 
are kept unorganized the ad-
ministration can do what it wills -
appoint its choice of students to 
important committees and 
allocate the fees without student 
input. The community 
surrounding the campus would 
then only hear the ad -
mi nistration 's views on land 
development and student living

Spring, 1975: The GPA 
Game is in Vogue Again 

by OOlvid Duricin 

More than any other single phrase, the title of thi. article best sums 
up my own personal feelings as my career at UCSD finally rolls to a 
close. It seems uncanny that the system whij:h underwent such 
tremendous attack during my initial year at UC has fully regained its 
powel and prestige only four years later . Spring quarter 1975 has seen 
an unprecedented outbreak of grademania in all of its ugliest forms . 
The campus is presently engulfed in talk of cum laudes, honor lists, 
and all important grad. point averages . To call the atmosphere 
depressing would be to g'rossly understate the true situation . 

The current grade festish sadly reflects the rapid change in student 
priorities over the past few years . The war in Indo china is no longer an 
issue of massive student protest, although the killing goes on in greater 
numbers tllan ever before. Civil rights and liberties for women and 
peoples of color are no longer seen as crucial to student interests. Yet, 
as the violence in Boston clearly illustrates, racism and sexism con-
tinue to plague American society. On th'e college campuses of. 1975, 
the battle for high GPAs has assumed ultimate importance. Yet, the 
grading system remains as before, cruel, elitist, and unjust. Grades 

measure the same qualities today that they did in 1%0; the ability to 
psyche out a professor and take tests, the competitive deSIre to be 
better than fellow students, the skill of regurgitation, and of course, the 
talent of cheating. 

At its very best, a grade can measure pure technical competence on 
a limited subject at a given moment in time . At its worst, a grade IS able 
to measure a person's ability to upchuck trivia that has been hOlled 
down his or her throat for several months by a researcher who views 
teaching as a marginal activity rather than a real profession To date, 
no one has been able to develop a system which measure those 
qualities of intelligence essential to our society's survival, social 
awareness and consciousness, desire to learn , motivation, enthUsiasm, 
cooperation, and willingness to help one 's fello.v man . 

It seems that the student of the 1%Os knew something that ha~ 
been forgotten in the GPA heyday of 1975 . The qualities of essential 
intelligence are not _measured by provosts ' honor lists, cum laude 
stripes , 700 LSAT scores, 98 · MCAT percentiles or 3.9 grade pOin t 
average. t\:!! of these honors are, in a very real ense, count r-
productive to the construction use of education. 

If there is a point to this article, it must be the following, I. for one, 
have no quick solutions to the CPA problem and all of its undesirable 
side effects. The long run answer will have to come from profound 
social and political change . Yet, in the mean time; grades must be kept 
on the lowest of all possible priorities . We must all find a way to 
prevent "Grade Point Madness" from overwhelming our involvemen t 
in more important social, political and economic issues. If we must all 
play the GPA game to some extent, then be it. But let us never, even for 
an instant, accept the grading system as credib le and valid, for grades 
are as misguided as is the educational institution itself . 

An Invitation for a

Christians at UCSD have been 
sponsoring a book table for 
several years . The book tab le has 
been set up as a place where 
people can come and discuss

The book table also has literature 
dealing with many topics from a 
Christian perspective . The table is 
located on the Revelle and Muir 
plazas at various hours of the day .

Letters to the Editor 
Readers Comment on 
Campus Fee, Coop 

Reed Letter Obscures Real Issue 
In his article (TT, April 2) 

Montgomery Reed obscures tile 
real iss ue. By connecting Young 
Ameri cans for Freedom with 
advocacy of the voluntary fee, he 
ideologizes an issue that has 
nothing to do with ideology By 
labeling the supporters of the 
voluntary fee as the "half-dozen 
quasi-John Bircher-Joseph M c-
Carthy i te-<:r ackpots," Reed hopes 
the prevalent liberal sentiment 
will rally to the battle cry and 

vote the opposit way of the 
right-wlngers. But the r al sup-
porters are not those half-dozen, 
but the almost 800 people who 
igned the petitions to end 

mandatory fees . This is 
Widespread support for the 
volu ntary fee on a campus that IS 
normally apathetic about most 
issues . Why 15 this? It's because 
students resent paying money for 
activi ties which don't benefit 
them . The Goop government 

thinks of student actiVities In 
terms of politiCS 

Montgomery Reed apparently 
expresses the main purpose of the 
Coop by saying, " At UCSD, the 
new Student Cooperative has 
taken a few Initial, and awkward 
steps In xpressmg concern for a 
sense of equity and lustice 
oPPosItion to rae ism, seXism, and 
the senseless domination and 
manipulation of our ilves and 
environment by the land-rape 
corporations and the rest of the 
corporate oligarchy " And so they 
allocate most of the student 
funds to "political clubs," par-
ticularly those that are of thell 
own tint But most students today 
are not interested in politics . ThiS 
very fact illustrates that the Coop 
IS not a representa tlve form of 
government. I t's really a select 
group that for some reason has 
been given control of the student 
cookie jar. 

Stude~t Finds $6 UCSD 
Fee Lowest In System 

Student Organizations 
Support Coop and Fee 

From April 23-25 and April 28-
29, undergraduate students at this 
campus will be asked if they want 
thei r $6 per quarter Student 
Activity Fee made voluntary, or if 
they want the fee to remain 
mandatory I would like to see the 
fee remain mandatory , and I.base 
my deCision on practical reasons. 
Below are the results of an in-
vestigation into other campuses 
I neluded is the UC system, and 
universities which have been 
ci ted by proponents of the 
voluntary fee as haVing " lots of 
activi tie .. 

In the UC system, not one 
campu has a voluntary activ ity 
fee The amounts of the fee are : 
UC Santa Barbara , 516.25 ; UC 
Riverside, $15 ; UC Berkeley : 
$1250, UC Santa Cruz, $10; UC 
DaVIS, $9; UC Irvine, 57.70; UC 
Los Angeles, $7 50 and with the 
lowest rate of all UC campuses, 
UC San Diego, 56. 

San Diego State, which ac-
cording to Tom Tanana has 
ponsored "succes ful concerts , 

fantas tic plays, noted speakers, 
and success ful sports events," did 
not use a voluntary fee to support 
these. Not only does State have a 
$10 mandatory fee, they also 
have a number of profitable 
enterprises to Ilelp out - among 
them are the Aztec center and the 
Aztec shops . In addition, they 
have over S300,OOO in reserve 
accounts and investments in 

. corporation and trust funds. The 
interest from this money alone 
helps pay for a large part of 
State's activities. 

USD, another school in San 
Diego that Tom seems fond of, is 
agai n not funded through 
volu ntary fees . Instead, they have 
a 525 per semester fee for full 
time students, and $15 for part-
timp students . 

As Steve White pornted out, 
though, some universities do have 
vo luntary fees . However, I am 
afraid Steve didn' t look deep 
enough into these colleges, and 
C)(ami ne the structure of their fee-
paying system . Stanford and 
Ca l tech have a voluntary fee, and 
at the same time they also have 
ac tivities. The reason? I suggest it 
IS because their implementation 
is a refund-based one. A student

at Stanford or Caltech must pay 
the activity fee, and only after he 
has done so may he apply for a 
refund, thereby giVing up any 
advantages he had by bei ng a part 
of what Stanford terms the 

" ~ tude nt body ." At UCSD , 
however, a student would decide 
whether or not to pay his activi ty 
fee at the time he paid h is other 
fees . This is somewhat different 
from a refund plan, and this 
difference is bound to have some 
effect. 

usc was the only University I 
cou ld reach that has a plan 
similar to what UCSD might 
undergo . Contrary ~ to Steve's 
comment "Soci al activities, 
sports , campus papers and 
speakers (s ic ) burea us are 
uniformly flourishing, " USC 
activities are having severe 
financial problem s. At the 
beginning of the spring semester 
of this year they voted for 
vo luntary fees . Out of a student 
body of over 20,000 students, and 
"Yith a $10 fee, about $6,000 
dribbled i n-- Iess than three 
percent of the students paid the 
fee 

Right now USC is dipping 
deeply IOtO slush funds, and next 
year will be forced to make 
cutbacks . If this semester is a sign 
of things to come, they in all 
ce rtainty will not be small cut-
backs . 

In summary, UCSD has one of 
the lowes t activity fees anywhere, 
but till manages to get along. 
And in my opinion, it does very 
well . Who could truthfully say 
UCSD has " hardly any activities 
at all?" One need only look 
around. " Westworld ," " Paper 
Chase," Bob Woodward, the 
Average' White Band , Gary 
Graffman, Old infinitum_ If USC 
and students with whom I have 
spoken are any indication, a 
voluntary fee would cause the 
loss of all this . I cannot predict 
the future with perfect accuracy, 
but I can extrapolate. I do not see 
voluntary fees " like magic " 
causing more activities, but 
rather I see voluntary fees 
destroying the 70cial life at 
UCSD. 

That is not something I eagerly 
look forward to. 

JOEL McCORMACK 

Editor 

The upcomlOg Spring Referendum has been touted as a chance for 
students to vote between " forced payment of fees" or " freedom of 
choi ce ." This characterization , from the Students for Voluntary Action , 
IS simply not true . What's really at stake in this vote is whether or not 
student organization and activities will have adequate funds to 
continue. 

It is critica l that the S6 Campus Activity Fee remain mandatory ThiS 
fee prov ides the funds fo r maintenance of the Women's Center, for a 
wide va riety of entertainers and speakers, for Black Consciousness 
Week, and for a vast array of other programs and services . If the 
student activity fee is eliminated many of these activities will cease 
altogether . Others will have to charge high admission prices . All will be 
subject to the whims of adm inistration-they will decide who gets the 
money and who does not. 

The second half of the Spring Referendum-Proposition Three-raises 
the question of the Student Cooperative's role in representing the 
stude nt body . 

Many people on campus have differing opinIOns on the ef-
fectiveness of the Coop as it is presently organized , but that's not the 
issue here. The question is whether a student government will exist 
here at UCSD at all 

NO alternative to the Student Cooperative as it is presently 
qrganized is given on the referendum. That the referendum seeks to 
eliminate any student voice at all is underscored by the nature of the 
next two questions, which pose the issue of who should control student 
fees and appointments - the Student Cooperative or the adminstration . 

That's just the point . For without a student government, all dec isions 
now made by students will be made by the administration . Not by 
students . That is why, no matter what our opinions on the current form 
of the Coop, we urge a " yes" vote on the question : "Should the Coop 
represent the UCSD student community?" 

The abovt' letter was signed by representatives of the Veterans' 
Coalition, the Black Science Students' Association, MECHA, the UCSD 
MusiciOlns' Guild, the Union of lewish Students, the Student 
Cooperative, CALPIRG, the Student Print Coop, the Ground Work 
Collective, the Student Coalition Against Racism, the US Committee 
for lustice to Latin American Political Prisoners, the Young Socialist 
Alliance, the Women's Center, and the Muir 5 &. Dime. NOlmes of 
representatives are on file. 

Civen the current boom In 
tennis, It IS reasonable to assume 
that students at UCSD are in-
terested in tennis But what does 
the Coop do? othing This 
winter the UCSD Tennis Club 
charged students 55 from their 
own pocket to join the club . The 
Coop didn't help defray the 
expenses . Not only that, for lack 
of funds the tennis club had to 
fold midterm and the club 
members lost half of their In-
vestment The Coop makes It a 
policy not to finanCially support 
recreational clubs that involve 
instruction, whether that be In 
tennis, ballet, etc . These students 
have to pay for their 'school 
activities, whereas the po Ii ticos 
have a 'free ride . How many UCSD 
tudents belong to these 

" political clubs?" Not many. How 
many students have ever been In 
much less used the services of the 
plush offices of the "political 
clubs" on the second floor of the 
Student Center? Probably not 
many. And yet people fill the 
tenni courts, wlmming pool, 
basketball courts, and perpetually 
circ le the soccer field . That's 
where the people are. These are 
several of the other activitle~ 
most students take an interest In . 
The fact is that around 53 percent 
of the mandatory fee money goes 
to these clubs and their obscure 
activities . 

The Coop appears to be 
danci ng to the tune of the 
political activism of the sixties 
and is out-of-date, out of touch 
w ith the real wishes of students 
today . Why should we be forced 
to give our money to the Coop? 

MIKE INGRASSIA 

If That's Freedom, Then We're in Trouble 
The Young Americans for Freedom want us to 

"have the freedom " to reject our activities fee and 
Student Cooperative. Let'r, hear it for : 

1) Our " freedom " to have our fees allocated by 
the administration, rather than students elected 
by the Coop; 

2) Our " freedom" to not have a unified voice on 

any Issues, 
3) Our " freedom" not to have movies and 

concert ; 
4) Our " freedom" not to have student recreation, 

ethnic, and public interest club . 
If tha t's " freedom, " we' re in trouble.

Referendum ·. • • 
Continued from Pale one 

task force composed of Student 
Affairs staff members and 
representatives from the College 
Councils would be formed to 
devise nett means to Perform 
these functions . Metz pointed out 
that a rejection of the Coop as a 
representative body would not 
abolish the Coop as a student 
organization. She commented " 
" The Coop will still exist after the 
election ." 

When asked why the words 
" official student government" 
were not used in the wording .of 
the sec ond proposition, Metz 
replied, " Because the Coop is not 
set up that way." She explained 
that she feels the Coop is 
organized as an open forum for 
students to express their views, 
and that the term "studen t 
gqvernment" does not apply to 
this type of structure. 

The board has for all practical 
purposes thrown out the wording 
of a petition written by Tom 
Tanana, president of UCSD Young 
Americans for ' Freedom, and 
ci rculated I ast quarter by the. 
SVA. The petition gathered 780 
signatures in support of a student 
referendum . Metz justified the 
rewriting of the referendum by 
saying, "The administration did 
not approve of the wording of 
Tom's petition as it stood ." She 
said the language was felt to be 
biased, and would not provide an 
explicit result for the Chancellor 
to act upon. 

The Chancellor has set a simple 
majority result based on at least 

Wedneaday,Aprll15,lV75 

50 percent participation as the 
requirement for considering the 
referendum to be binding . If this 
requirement is not met, he will 
make a decision based on his Own 
judgment. 

Metz related that an informal 
check of other California cam-
puses, both inside and outside the 
UC system, revealed that of 17 
recent campus elections, none 
had' gathered more than 40 
percent participation by the 
student body. S~e said this was 
the "primary reason why we have 
the election running for such 9 
long time." It was felt that five 
days of balloting will increase the 
chances of meeting the 50 
percent requirement. 

Regarding her impartiality to sit 
on the election board, con-
si dering that she is currently a 
voting Coop member , Metz 
commented, " I have not been 
voting on any matters having to 
do with this election . I have been 
voting on other matters . I have 
my personal feelings on this 
matter. and they will remain just 
that. "

Film: Steve Esmedina 
Yakuza, Pepper, Funny Lady 

"The Yikuzi" is an attractive fusion of movie fantasy 
readymades. But Schrader, rewrite man Robert 
Towne, and director Pollack all seem so fascinated 
by the mythic splendor of the idea that they have 
fJiled to provide the guts and vigor needed to 
transcend the gorgeous decor. This is no fanatical 
revisionist work It is not a send·up . The hot blue 
neon lighting, the rich pop color, the mournful 
looks and downtrodden dialogue all give it an 
appealingly murky feel , but it never meshes with 
any kind of ir.terior motivation of logic. 

Local Pianist to Perform 
In Mandeville on Sunday 

Directed by Sydney PolI~ck 
Written by P~ul Schrider ~nd Robert Towne 

There is probably no film form that Sydney Pollack 
could not s\Yathe in layers of lush, blurry 
luminescence . His gauzy romanticism has in-
fil trated the Western ("Jeremiah Johnson"), social 
allegory ("They Shoot Horses, Don' t They?"), and 
fou nd a compatible lover in "The Way We Were ." 
Now, with "The Yakuza," Pollack has embraced the 
American and Japanese gansler genres with the 
arne luscious enthusiasm. The resu It is a lovely-to· 

look-at pile of muddled mythology that is rendered 
50 traight-faced that the viewer feels compelled to 
figure out what the hell is going on 

The plot of " The Yakuza" reads like an aging 
bluepri nt· an old, semi-retired private eye (Robert 
Mitchum) is sent to Tokyo to recover a friend's 
daughter from a Japanese gangster who i~ holdi ng 
her hostage . When he arrives he immediately 
rek indies a post World War II love affair, and 
rec ruits the aid of a retired lapanese swordsman· 
gangster. or Yakuza (Takamura ' Ken) who hates 
Mitchum, but owes him his life. After rescuing his 
friend's daughter, Mitchum learns that Ken is 
marked for death by the angered gangster, and that 
his friend (Brian Keith) has marked him for death. 

Summarily, the movie charts a rough ap-
proximation of what you might gue s, but it does so 
In such a stol id, taciturn fashion that much of the 
simple plot mechanics are exceedingly difficult" to 
figure out. 

I t is plain to see what author Paul Schrader had to 
mind : a cross-cultural blending of popular film 
myths: the Japanese code of honor among modern 
warriors, and the American notion of the word-
bound criminal as a vanishing species . Potentially it 

Mitchum and Ken perform ~ith dire intensity, 
particularly Ken who combines the acrobatic 
physicality of Bruce Lee with the world weary angst 
of an actor like William Holden. 

Unfortunately , Pollack's cream-puff sty le never 
resonates with fervor. The action sequences are 
photographed so haphazardly that almost every 
crucial moment of violence is off-camera . Pollack is 
not a dynamic primitive like Sam Peckinpah and 
John Boorman His action scenes are mixed up, 
obscured, rudderless . The end effect of this artsy-
craftsy clumsiAess is that "The Yakuza" never has a 
chance to emerge as anything but a dreamy paean 
to a filmrraking stylfthat the filmmakers appear to 
lack any viable contact with

Enticing in so many ways, rock 
and roll is musical en-
tertainment's big buck. Yet more 
and more we realize it's also the 
big burn . They don't bother to put 
the seats in at Golden Hall when 
Zappa comes to town. For good 
reasons . On the other hand, 
cou ntry-wes tern, scorned by 
serious music listeners 
everywhere, aspires to a certain 
elegance, and Nashville not only 
makes a lot of money but has a 
cherished institution in the Grand 
OleOpry. Somewhere in between 
these extremes of popular music 
is simple good taste and your 
money's worth . A capacity 
audience sought these qualities 
Sunday night at Gordon light-
foot's Golden Hall concert. 

I! 's not surprising that a 
folksinger like Lightfoot would 
draw such a large audience - the 
roots of folk run long and deep. 
But the variety of types in the 
audience, from uptown ladies 
and their escorts ODed on Chanel 
to Spri ng Valley goat-ropers , are 
indicative of the broad group 
looking for a middle ground . At 
some point in Lightfoot's ,show, 
nearly all these people found 
something to be at home with . He 
loses the fringes, particularly the 
very square, but, oh, so what if 
he's divorced; sowhat if he hasn 't 
been doing his pushups; so what 
if he talks a little too much about

getting loaded; a lot of his old 
music is great, just great. 

Lightfoot's reputation rests on 
many years of pleasing folk lovers 
with his bawdy tales and salty 
doggerels, songs ' of mountain 
men , clipper ships, and shady 
ladies, all familiar, universal 
themes . Though some of 
Lightfoot's songs are ten years 
old , applause greeted nearly 
every number, as he picked a riff 
and approached the mike in a 
voice which is a peculiar blend of 
croon and yodel. 

He sang most of his old 
favorites : " High and Dry," "Come 
on, Pearl," " Birds of a Feather," 
" All the Lovely Ladies," songs 
which , though maybe not 
recognized by title, are probably 
familiar to the ear. He sang about 
seamen, looking like a bit of a 
seaman, too, in his white bell-
bottoms and blOusy shirt; he sang 
of ladies in ports of the world . He 
ang of mountainmen, and his 

own " minstrel's misfortune of 
being forever displaced." His 
favorite hero is an Everyman; "he 
is wild, he is mellow/ He is strong 
and he is weak ." The man is a 
victim of Fate, and generally that 
fate takes the form of a woman . 

Lighfoot loves his ladies. They 
turn up in his songs as " battered, 
reliable wrecks" and too-brief 
encounters; he usually hopes to 
see them again, or wishes it could 
have been better. Often, his 
ladies take the form of the

" Rainy Day People," his current 
hit, illustrates Lightfoot's attitude 
toward the romantic condition : 
"There's no sorrow you can't rise 
above." The song further ex-
presses what Lightfoot seems to 
think is a fundamental. quality in 
loving couples . 

Rainy day lovers don't love 
any others-
that would not be kind. 

Rainy day people all know 
how it hangs 
on your peace of mind . 

Lightfoot's music reflects the 
good rhythmiC sounds of nature 
and living anywhere; there's a 
vitality, a regional flavor in his 
songs and his own engaging 
personality which brings out the 
best in his audience - his auc-

imitation had the hog<allers in

From the sounds, Lightfoot 
creates a picture of Western 
development which could be 
held up in front of an elementary

Games For YO'U 
t 

and Your Grasshopper 
by lerry RAdich 

IIHItU Writer 
It has long been known that 

the best way to curb the boredom 
of studying is to take time out and 
get some therapeutic exercise. 
But since it is often difficult to 
play softball in your living room 
or tennis in the friendly confines 
of your bathroom, this essential 
need of every student is often 
reglected . But have f.aith 
frustrated' bookworms, for here 
are a few games that can be 
played in the intimacy of your 
own home that are both exciting 
and psychologically satisfying. 

M.,.Arine Fencing 

until one of the contestants 
successfully manages to get 
margarine from the tub to his roll, 
a feat which is easier said than 
done if his opponent is a skillful 
master of this noble recreation . 
All blows are naturally restricted 
to the knives, and any lacerations 
or stabs into a contestant's body 
calls for the immediate 
disqualification of the offender. 

Suffice it to say that this event 
spruces up an ordinary dinner 
affair into a breathtaking display 
of coordination and courage. 

How often have you grabbed a GrAsshopper Hockey 
hot dinner roll at supper, quickly 
reached for the tub of margarine, 
only to find out that your 
roommate aced you out and 
captured it first? So there you sit,

hand, your meal and probably For those people who prefer a

used as the basis of Margarine Hockey. This game originated in 
Fencing. In this game you and British Columbia where 
your opponent sit across from grasshoppers are exceedi ngly 
each other at the dinner talbe, plentiful , but can be played here 
with the tub of margarine sitting during the spring and summer 
between you, about at an arm's months when grasshoppers make

picky about the grasshoppers. 

To begin the duel, hot-rolls are These ,hould range from 1-2

This high speed fencing continues brooms. 

It often amazes me how Quick 
those little devils can bolt away 
just when you're about to knock 
them with a nite slap shot. Do 
not resort to beating the 
grasshopper into submission iust 
so you can pass it better or hit a 
better shot. Granted, a dead or 
temporarily untonscious 
grasshopper is much easier to hit 
than a l ive one, but part of the 
fun, challenge and skill of this 
game is moving a live, scared 
grasshopper player 's brooms . 
Rendering the grasshopper im-
mobile merely detracts from the 
game, and is therefore 
discouraged . 

I n a pinch other objects can be 
used for pucks, such as beetles, 
frogs, or any small household pet. 
Once you become an ex-
perienced and skillful player you 
will probably wish to graduate to 
more active pucks than the 
grasshopper. Perhaps the most 
exciting way to play the game is 
by using a small but mature cat 
for the puck. Just think of the 
added excitement when you try 
to swat around a puck that is 
perfectly capable and willing to 
scratch out your eyes or gnaw on 
part of your leg. 

There are many more 
household games, from Cur-
tainrod Basketball to the fabulous 
Indoor Olympics, but it is better if 
you come up with your own 
imaginative passtimes. The 
possibilities of household games 
is only limited by the imagination 
and liabil ity insurance, so put 
down those boring books and 
dream up some new varieties of 
competitive entertainment. And 
when you stumble onto that gem 
of genius, give me a call-I'm game 
for anything.

New Athletic Budget 
Eliminates Four Teams 

by DAve Eisen 
I..-Wrlter 

" I can't say I'm happy with our 
budget when we have to cut 
teams, but we 'll have to live with 
it", said UCSD Athletic Direc tor 
Howard Hunt in an interview 
Tuesday. 

'Four teams, junior varsity 
basketball , Rugby II ,Club Soccer, 
and Snow Skiing will be 
eliminated for the 1975-76 season 
because, according to Hunt, they 
don' t pass the new UCSD in-
tercollegiate standards. The rigid 
new standards, which include the 
abolishing of all second or junior 
varsity teams, were set up 
because the athletic department 
was allocated only the same 
amount as the 1974-75 total. 

The allocated budget of just 
over 590,000 doem't defray rising 
costs, hence the cut-back is 
necessary. Because · of student 
interest, however, men 'and 
women 's cycli ng , women's 
saili ng, and women's crew are 
being added for next year. UCSD's 
total of 31 teams will continue to 
lead the nation in intercollegiate 
teams . 

The new budget was given to 
the athletic department by the 
Registration Fee Committee, 
under the direction of Vice-
Chancellor George Murphy. 

" It wasn't really close to what 
we wanted", Hunt $aid . " We also 
tried to get some new things , like 
a full-time trai ner, a Sports I n-
formation Director, and some 
sports awards, but they turned us 
down." 

The Intramurals- won' t suffer at 

all next year . The Recreation 
Department, which runs the 
intramurals, were given an in-
crease for next year. This keeps 
with the 'UCSD Athletic 
Philosophy', ~hich strives to get 
more students involved in a larger 
variety of sports, according to 
Hunt. 

I n offsetting a lack of money, 
the athl tic department will have 
to come up wi th some new ideas. 
One of these, which will be what 
Hunt ca lls "a common uniform 
exchange". Uniforms will be used 
by more than one team, so the 
school will be able to mass order, 
thus saving money. 

Une budget that will go up is 
one for AII-Cal Tournies . The 
allotment for the UC system will 
go from 515,000 to $35,000. UCSD 
wi II send a record high 20 \-eams 
to AII-Cal events next year. 

Hunt has been Athletic 
Director for all 'ten years of the 
school 's exi tence, so he should 
be able to give an accurate 

pr~diction of UCSD's ports 
future 

" I believe that our program will 
conti nue to strengthen in the 
future . Our philosophy on 
athletics will remain and we' ll 
have a growing number of teams, 
especia lly for women . I can see 
the possibility of UCSD joining an 
athletic conference, probably 
with sc hools like Irvine, River-
side, and Cal State Dominquez . 

" The issues of giving 
sc holarships and having a 
football team will come up again 
also If the ' students show the 
interest, that's what we' ll have".

UCSD Faculty Members 
Come to Aid of UFW 

uc San Diego faculty members 
last week launched a fund raIsing 
campaign for the United Farm 
Workers Union (UFW), 

Drs Harold ~rey , Herbert 
Marcuse, Herbert York, and 
George Mandler are among those 
who have pledged donations to 
aid the UFW 

Si nce winning the grape strike 
in 1970, the UFW has existed 
under tremendous pressure from 
growers and the Teamsters Union, 
who alledgedly collaborated on 
signi ng unjust "s weatheart 
contracts" . 

The Teamsters also seemed to 
manipulated such contracts with 
some wine makers, most notably 
Gallo, who had earlier signed 
with the UFW. 

However, recent occurances 
have strengthened hopes for 
eventua l victory , the union 

believes . The Teamsters have 
abandoned its catch-all local 
used to attrac t farm workers and 
the national boycott of Callo 
wines has had a noticeable effect. 
And, the March 1 UFW rally in 
Modesto, home of Gallo, drew 
nearly 20,000 workers and friends 
instead of the expected 5,000. 

I n response to these turn of 
events, some UCSD faculty have 
moved to aid the UFW. literature 
chairman Dr. Jos<,ph Sommers, 
history professor Ricardo Romo, 
and faculty member Frank Saiz 
helped in the project that within a 
week has contacted nearly 85 
percent of the faculty and 
co llected over $500 in donations. 
Professor Romo, treasurer of the 
informa l committee, thinks the 
total hould reach $2000 by the 
end of this week . He added that 

oncerned faculty should 
respond by April 21

believes William Frazer, chairperson of the Physics 
department 

Pretty much the same situation existed last year 
for graduate support funding for this academIC 
year. The gap between the graduate support iunded 
by the state and UCSD's needs was made up 
through monies granted because of over 
enrollment Because more students showed up for 
classes than was expected, the sta te allocated 
addItional money 

The amount faculty members would be asked to 
contribute would be around $100, according to 
Pearce. The contribution would also be tax 
deductable. Such is not the case this year, however, because
