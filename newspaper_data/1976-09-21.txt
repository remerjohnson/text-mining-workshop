Students CaD probably make tbeir greatest Impact OD university 
operations througb membersblp on campus-wide and college com-
mittees. It bas been said more than once-aDd no doubt aptly-that 
UCSD is run by committee. Thirty~lgbt campus-wide panels advise 
the administratJon or make scbool poUcy on nearly everything, from 
"wbat goes In your bead to wbat goes In your stomacb," as tbe Coop 
coordination In charge of committee appolDtments last year said. 

Tbe committees IDcJude tbe Program Review Committee-
CbaDcellor McElroy's prlDeipal advisory panel-wbleb reviews all 
educational programs and expenditures, tbe Housing aDd Food Ser-
vices Committee and the Campus Program Board. 

Committee membership is important for reasons beyond the 
presentation of a student viewpoint. It Is vital for the dissemination of 
information about university policy and for communication between 
students aDd administrators. 

Participation Is also important as a determlDer of the success or 
failure of the Coop. It's very nature, as laid out in the 1974 Student 
Cooperative proposal, lays beavy dependance on student InvolvemeDt. 
Coop membersbip is voluntary, without the tradltioual elected studeDt 
government officials, so it gains or loses credibility on the basis of 
participation, drawings Its power directly from tbe students who at-
tend the weekly meetings. 

Participation through sports, clubs and arts-activiHes is Important 
for other, equally valid reasons. Through sueb activities studeDts can 
gain a stronger senr:e of individual identity, which tbey migbt other-
wise feel lost in tbe university's vast operation. In addition, joining a 
club or playing intramurals Is just a good way to meet people. 

Of course, ther!! ::rc a:-eas where increased student Involvement is 
sorely needed. There is little participation in tbe plaoning of 
curriculum and coUege requirements. There Is not enougb direct Input 
on maDY important administrative dedsioDs. Possibly tbe most 
neglected area is the determinatioD of Registration Fee use, wbere 
there is certainiy not enough direct student Input on determination of 
tbe use of all student fee monies. 

But the answer to the problem of under representation is not to 
ignore it, hoping it will go away and solve itself. It wlll not. 
Administrators wlll continue to make decisioDS affecting student Ufe 
whether they get the input or not. 

And it is difficult, often, for students to find the time to participate, 
witb the beavy class loads common at UCSD. But it caD be done -
maay students prove it every year. 

The opportunities are available. The reasons clear. Whether you 
WaDt to effect cbange or keep things as they are, meet people or play 
softball, jow tbe Ski Club or tbe YOUDg Socialist Alliance: do It. The 
university can OfteD seem cold aDd Impersoual, a studeDt just one of 
8000. U you don' t get IDvolved, it wlll just pass you by. 

Use tbe University. Don't let It use you. 

MCElroy: Time 10 make 
UeSD "Greal UniverSity" 

With pleasure T welcome our new and returning students to UC San 
Diego for this school year. It has been twelve years since the first 
undergraduates enrolled here, and with each year the University has 
grown in academic stature and sense of community. 

Although many students will notice a nurn&er of physical im-
provements and additional faculty, all of us should understand that 
our previous rapid growth phase has about ended. We are in effect 
entering a new era in the short history of our campus. With most ex-
pansion behind us, we can now concentrate increased attention to 
ideas and attitudes which make a truly great university. 

In the ideal, a university is an academic community. It is academic 
because a university is a place where sophisticated learning takes 
place and new knowledge is created and explored. It is a community 
because ever::one has some common purpose, everyone is united in a 
search for a n '.OI;e precise understanding. 

As 1 said, tlus is the ideal. And like any ideal there is always a gap 
between that and the reality of everyday experiences. To so many 
students the university is a formidable place, more a series of ob-
stacles than a satisfying experience. To so many the university is 
simply a way s tation in life, simply a four year interlude between high 
school and a (3~er. 

I think this year is the appropriate time for all of us to make a more 
conscious eft Jrt to build a superior sense of campus community. It is 
time for the (ampus to settle in, to develop some deeper attachments, 
greater serv.ces, and a more comfortable, personalized atmosphere. 
Building a bt'tter campus environment will enormously help both the 
academic anl social climate which enables all of us to perform better 
and Jive a ful:er life. 

How does one go a bout this? After giving first priority to learning, I 
hope each of you will participate in some aspects of campus life . There 
is a wealth of activities and institutions on the campus that cannot help 
but be better with greater interest and student participation. With 
your initiative, our campus can become more lively and more in-
teresting, with civility and gentleness to all, to the end of achievin~ a 
close approximation of the id al academic commWlity.

Maoy ProblemS Faca unlverslly 
by Mark StacDer 

ManaglDg EdItor 
You are part of higher education 

as the institution moves Into a 
period cl increased attack on Its 
basic precepts. These attacks 
come from -LWU WMil..:\ricolly 
opposite directions. 

One attack is on the notion that 
education beyond high school Is 
necessary for success in American 
society. These critics rather 
contend that "college isn't for 
everyone." They denoWlce the Idea 
of over education, saying most 
people are better off going to work 
instead of college. They also attack 
goverrunent sublidies of higher 
education. 

Other are equally critical of the 
university system, saying it is too 
elitist. Such critics believe higher 
education systematically excludes 
certain persons for monetary and 
racial reasons. They call for in-
creased goverrunent fWlding, in an 
effort to make college more ac-
cessible to all Americans, 
regardless of race or personal 
wealth. 

Lack of Money 
While the university defends 

itself against both attacks it is also 
faced with the symptoms of the 
current economic situation : 
shrinking financial resources. At 
the University of California the 
governing Board of Regents and 
UC President David Saxon fight an 
annual battle with a governor and 
state legislature less and less in-
clined to increase university 
funding. One result of this trend is 
next year's $48 Registration Fee 
increase. Another is the rapidly-
increasing faculty-student and 
teaching assistant-student ratio. A 
third is the building moratorium 
which is currently being imposed 
on UC by Gov. Brown. 

There is one good reason for such 
a moratorium, which can be 
discerned after an examination of 
enrollment figures at lower 
education levels. Elementary, 
junior high and high school 
enrollments are, shrinking allover 
the state. This trend is already 
reaching universities and has 
visibly arrived at uam. 

The original UCSD Master Plan 
called for a maximum enrollment 
of 29,000 undergraduate students, 
with 12 colleges. However, the plan 
is being revised, with maximum 
enrollment set at 10,000. Current 
Wldergraduate enrollment is about 
8,000. 

No matter what the enrollment, 
UCSD is an interesting campus. It 
has no focal point for student ao. 
tivity-no strong student govern-
ment or bigtime football team, no 
organized student union or central 
education concern. Student 
fractionalism is also encouraged 
by the college system, with 
students at each college having 
different and speoial cirÂ· 
cumstances. 

Varied Images 
Such fractionalism has led to

variollJ images of UCSD: a place 
where everyone sleeps with their 
school books, the spot 'fhereSaxon 
got hassled by the students 
(although many feel it was also the 
other way around), a mecca for 
swfers and sWllovers. 

All these images, and others, are 
true to some extent. The sun does 
shine a lot; the beacb is a nice 
place. Suon did visit last 
November. And studying is a big 
thing on campus. 

Possibly the biggest thing. UCSD 
bas a reputation for strong 
academic programs. The natural 
science departments are 
characterized as excellent in both 
classroom and research activity. If 
dollar contributions are an ac-
curate measure of acadenUc ex-
cellence, then UCSD's reputation is 
wellÂ·placed : the campus last year 
received the third-most federal 
research dollars in the nation. 

UCSD's humanities and social 
science departments have not 
fared quite as well. In fact, it 
sometimes seems that depart-
ments in those two areas are left 
out in the shuffle. Despite ad-
ministrative statements to the 
contrary, it appears the imbalance 
between those classes and natural 
science courses noted in 1973 by the 
visiting accreditation team sill 
exists. 

In fact, most humanities and 
social science departments seem 
fortunate to hold even in the annual 
scramble for faculty and TA 
allocations. For instance, the 
literature department-Â·which 
should stand as the mainstay of 
any first-rate humanities core-
appears to be shrinlting in size. 
Certainly, a glimpse at the fall 
quarter class schedule indicates 
the literature selection is more 
limited than before. 

Too Few Profs 
In the social sciences the 

situation Is much the same. In 
particular, programs like Com-
mWlications, which are lnunensely 
popular, suffer greatly from lack 
of faculty and T As. Com-
munications, which has more 
majors than many departments, 
~ ~:'.!j' ~~ te~~re'i !)r(lfessor. 
Students majoring in such 
programs - Third World Studies, 
Tbird World Literature and 
Conununications, among others -
feel (t is past time for them to be 
made full-fledged departments. 

A problem plaguing all depart-
Dlents at UCSD is the divergence 
of faculty priorities between 
research and teaching. Speaking 
strictly in generalizations-which 
can be dangerous-it would seem 
students prefer professors to 
devote more time to classroom 
duties, while administrators would 
rather faculty spend more time in 
research. 

Certainly it would be in the best 
interest of each group to feel that 
way. Students naturally gain more 
from professors who place 
teaching before research. The 
school administration, on the other 
hand, gains more from research, 
as it draws increased federal and 
private funding. 

As students we naturally side 
with those who favor teaching 
before research, believing perhaps 
naively the university's main 
function to be education of 
students. 

Tenure Ritual 
The teaching-research issue is 

most evident in the annual tenure 
ritual, when professors are 
evaluated by their peers to 
detennlne who gains job security. 
As would be expected most 
students feel teaching ability 
should be the main factors in 
tenure evaluations. Administra-

The Triton Times has paid 
positions open for Office manager, 
staff writers, production 
assistants, photographers and 
illustrators. 

Applicants for the pooltions 
should come to the new Triton 
Times office, on the south-west 
comer of the Student Center. 

The Office manager spot is 
especially crucial, as that person 
supervises the operation of the 
newspaper office and is in charge 
of the classified advertiSing 
department . 

The position is paid between $30 
and $40 per week, depending on the 
amount of hours worked. 

Staff writers are needed in the 
news, sports and arts departments, 
to cover a variety of on- and off-

campus events. 
Production assistants help the 

Production manager layout the 
paper and write headlines. 

Copy readers work with the Copy 
Editor to insure the stylistic 
quality of Triton Times material. 

The pay for staff writers is on a 
per'article basis. The other 
positions are paid a flat weekly 
sum, except for illustrators, who 
are paid individually for each piece 
of artwork. 

Experience - although of course 
welcome in all cases - is not 
necessary except for staff 
photographers and illustrators. 
Persons applying for those 
positions should bring samples of 
their work to the Triton Times 
office when applying.

Is it pbilosopt1y you'd like to take 
instead of that Math requirement? 
Or maybe you'd prefer another 
science course to Humanities? 

In any case, the key to getting 
out of a required class you don't 
want to take is to get the right 
signatures on an Undergraduate 
Student Petition. 

The petitions are easily available 
at the Registrar's office. The 
signatures may be a bit harder to 
come by. 

Three Signatures 

required. "The provost's signature 
is vital on a request to waive or 
exchange a class for a college 
requirement, while the department 
chair is needed on a request to 
waive a requirement for your 
major. 

If you'd like to waive a Â·college 
requirement, Richburg's advice is 
to start with a visit to an academic 
counselor at your college. And 
have a very good reason. 

Couselon Agree on W.lven 
Interviews with representatives. 

of the four colleges bear this point 
out. Revelle academic counselor 
Nancy Groves, for instance, said 
students at that college are almost 
never' let out of required classes 
without having a comparable 
replacement course. 

Third academic counselor Rena 
Reno said Third students are never 
allowed to waive a college 
reqtiirement. Classes, however, 
can be substituted for 
requirements in some cases, she 
added. To arrange such a trade 
Third students should first meet 
with an academic counselor. 

After you visit your college 
counselor and get the required 
signatures on your petition, bring 
the completed fonn back to the 
provost's office. 

There you can meet with an 
academic counselor to plead your 
case personally, or just submit 
your petition to be processed. 

Any adverse decisions can be 
appealed to the provost. .

There are spaces for three 
names on the petition fonn: 
professor, department chair and

Special Â·studies courses are the 
way you can study subjects that 
aren't regularly offered for 
university credit. 

The courses - labelled 197, 198 
and 199 in the course catalog-are 
offered in three areas: individually 
arranged Â· field st~es (l97s),' 
directed group studies (1988) and 
individual independent studies 
(l99s) . 

The process to follow in making 
up your own class is f~irly simple. 
The key, in all three cases, is to 
fin!! a professor willing to sponsor 
your venture. 

Get Faculty List 
First, take your idea to the ap-

propriate department. For in-
stance, if you want to study the rise 
and fall of the Whig Party in the 
United States, you would go to the 
history department. There you can 
get a list of faculty in that 
department willing to sponsor 
special courses. 

For 197s and 199s everything is 
Individually arranged between 
yourself and the professor. For 
199s, the group studies, you need to 
find a faculty member willing to 
take on an entire class. 

Then, fill out the Special Studies 

Course application form, available 
at each department office. Both

Clubs Solve Boredom SyndrOme 
Webster defines loneliness as the 

" quality 'or state of being lonely; 
being without company; cut off 
frOm others." Not true. 

ooeliness is but a state of mind; 
" create the physical separation. 
Being lonely is not a prescript of 
living. Rather, one has to 
premeditate cutting oneself off 
from others. 

The academic environment at 
UCSD polarizes students into a 
situation where the University 
becomes fiDed with a mass of 

lonely bodies. There is no excuse 
for this. We are not robots 
programmed to follow a 
prescribed social pattern. But we 
must liberate ourselves from the 
adverse affects of our academic 
environment. 

" I'd like to go to the movies with 
you, but I have a JXlper due, and a 
midtenn next week ... and .. _" It 
seems like college work never 
ends. Students at UCSD who 
complain about the lack of time to 
do nonnal "living" things usually 
waste their time worrying about 
school work. They end up in a rut 
which is compounded by lack of 
variety and loneliness. It needn't 
be this way. 

The infamous study break: a few 
minutes to get a cup of coffee, meet 
some friends and discuss an exam 
you took or one you are about to 
take. After an hour or two, back to 
the books again, without having 
thought to catch a quick movie on 
campus or entertainment at the 
Revelle Side Door. 

That study break could have 
been taken playing a game of 
tennis or driving into La Jolla. One 
must escape from the loneliness of 
eternal studying to exercise the 
physical beini. It requires time to 
adapt to the new study enÂ·

vironment of UCSD, but once the 
fear of academics has been 
overcome, the lonely feeling of 8 
study hall can be supplemented by 
an active social life. 

Most students have to learn to 
make the time : loneliness will not 
dissolve away. To overcome the 
pains of being lonely, a small 
portion !If time must be invested 
exclusively into being a social 
being. 

Where does one go to meet 
people and get involved in campus 

affairs? The problems of making 
the jump into the social en-
vironment can be as difficult as 
JXlssing a final. No one is going to 
push you into meeting people : you 
must assert yourself. Gaining 
friendships and meeting people 
means that taking the initiative is 
of great importance. In order to 
gain companionship and end 
loneliness you're going to have to 
jwnp into the social envirOllIJ.le~t. 
UCSD provides many outlets in 

which to become involved. 
Culture, politics, sports, 

relaxation - there are groups on 
campus to suit just about every 
student interest and need. 

Associations serving a specific 
part of the student community 
include the Black Student Union, 
the Asian-American Student 
Alliance, MECHA, The Graduate 
Student Union, United Native 
Americans, Union of Jewish 
Students, the Disabled Student 
Union, Third World Cultural 
Productions and others_ 

There are many and sundry 
political and public affairs-
oriented groups on campus as well, 
a partial list being the California 
College Republicans, the Young 
Socialist Alliance , the UCSD 
Libertarians, the Young 
Americans for Freedom, the UCSD 
Young Conservatives, the 
Industrial Workers of the World, 
the United Fann Workers Support 
Group and the California Public 
Interest Research Group. 

Further infonnation on these 
and other groups 'Can be obtained 
at the Student Organizations office 
on the second floor of the Student 
Center. 

For those seeking recreation, 
there are clubs being fonned in the 
following areas: Aikido, Ballroom 
Dance, Belly Dance, Bicycle, 
Conditioning, Dance Ensemble, 
Fencing, Folk Dance, Going 
Places, Gymnastics, Horseback 
Riding, Israeli Dance, Jazz Dance, 
Karate, Outing Club, Scuba, Snow 
Ski, Soaring, Surfing, Table Tennis 
and Yoga. 

The first meetings of these clubs 
will be held between Oct. 4th and 
Oct. 12th. For details, or if you are 
interested in starting a new club,

ucla Â·Iludeol Services 
Make COllege Llle Easler Bazaar, lew Games Head Welcome Week 

UCSD baa a variety of services 
that hf!lp make a student's ex-
perience at college a liWe Wier. 
Some are aimed at a special 
group; others are for all students. 
Some are student-operated and 
some university-run. 

Following is a description of 
some of the more prominent 
student services. 
Peer Advisory Group Experience 
Page One, the Peer Advisory 

Group Experience, maintains the 
philosophy that the best advice for 
a student is from a fellow student. 
Besides helping' students through 
academic and administrative 
hassles, they will sit down with 
students and talk about any per-
sonal problem. 

Those working for Page One are 
highly motivated toward the 
"student experience" and are 
trained to deal with the university 
bureaucracy. Page One is located 
on the Muir campus below the Muir 
Conunons. 

Gay Stlldents Association 
The Gay Student Association 

(GSA ) is an organization which . 
tries to help with problems in the 
gay student community. They hold 
regular weeldy meeting!! in a 
specified location (announced in 
the Triton Times). The meetings 
provide a social environment in 
which students can bring up a 
variety of discussion topics that 
concern gays. 

There is also a gay phone line 
located in their student center 
office for use as an infonnation 
service. The phone line can be used 
for personal assistance, for those 
who feel the need for com-
mWlication with other gay people, 
but are hestiant to participate in 
the association's activities. 

SexCliDic 
The Sex Clinic was started by Dr. 

Hugh Pates, a counseling 
psychologist, and Dr. Judith 
Jorgensen, a psychiatrist. Similar 
to the Masters and Johnson 
program, it is set up to counsel 
students on sexual and sexually-
related problems. UCSD's Sex 
Clinic is one of only three among 
colleges and universities in the 
United States. 

The initial problem is getting 
strength to go and see a counselor 
about a problem as personal as 
sex. Once that fear is overcome 
students find a very easy attitude 
about the clinic's role. Many 
students enjoy going to the Clinic's 
informal discussion sessions to 
hear other students with similar 
problems. 

InternatiOlUlI Center 
The International Center directs 

itself toward the foreign student 
and helping with the adjustment to 
the UCSD environment. Foreign 
students can go to the center and 
receive counseling on any 
problems that may arise in 
becoming a part of the American 
educational system. 

The center holds regular Friday 
night get-togethers in which 
foreign students can meet other 
students who might be suffering 
the same problems of. loneliness. 
The center is staffed with multi-
lingual personnel ; language 
tutoring is available. The Inter-
national Center Is located on the 
MaHhews Campus. 
Commuter ad Advocacy Center 
The Commuter and Advocacy 

Center is set up as an ald to 
conunuter students. The center 
acts as an information and ad-
visory program for students who 
want special infonnation on social 
events happening on and off 
campus. Center staffers welcome 
students to come and talk about the 
problem of. getting involved when 
you live off~ampus. Students in 
the center keep current in-
fonnation on parties and other 
social events going on in the off-
campus conununities. 

The center is also involved in 

student-faculty relations and has 
done much In the way of 
educational change at Revelle 
College. The Commuter and 
Advocacy Center Is located on the 
Revelle Campus adjacent to the 
T.V. room in Blake Hall. 

Facilltator'. Program 
The Facilitator's Program is a 

Third College-based organization 
working on the peer counseling 
philosophy. Staffers keep in-
fonnation files on activities of 
interest to the student. If there are 
no activities going on they will 
many times form their own ac-
tivities to meet the needs of the 
students. They will locate students 
to fonn groups for social activities. 

- The facilitators a lso hel p 
students with academic problems, 
including helping students to ap-
proach faculty and staff. Many 
times they will act as liaison to 
help students deal with the 
lUliversity administrative hassles. 

ua;D Orientation Week will be 
highlighted this year by the second 
annual Bazaar Bizarre and UC-
SD's first New Games tournament. 

The bazaar, scheduled to start at 
the Student Center Thursday at 
noon and run through the af-
ternoon, will feature a 75c lunch, 
tables giving information 'on 
student organizations and student 
Affairs units, and four hours of 
non-stop entertairunent. 

The entertainment at the bazaar-
-which is again hosted by the 
Student Center-includes comedian 
Joy Mosst , Teatro Folklorico 
Azteca, folk and belly dancing and 
iots of music. 

Mosse-who has performed her 
solo act at the Troubador, the 
Comedy Store and on the college 
circuit-is set to bring her "ex-
ceptionally diverse outlook on life 
to the bazaar at 1 pm. 

The lunch, to be served 
throughout the afternoon, features 
tamales, potatp salad, beans and

soft drinks. 
Then, on Sunday afternoon from 

noon to 4 pm on the Soccer Field, 
UCSD will have its first New 
Games tournament. 

The New Games seem uniquely 
suited to UCSD, where the sports 
emphasis is generally on par-
ticipation instead of just winning, 

The games are an outgrowth of 
two "play philosophies." One is 
"Soft War," Whole Earth Catalog 
creator Stewart Brand's theory 'of 
an alternative means for physical 
release of aggression. 

The other philosophy is George 
~onard's "creative play," which 
allows players to use their 
imagination in a free-form en-
virorunent, with no set rules. 

The two philosophies serve to 
make New Games an alternative to 
traditionally structured sports. 

In a further departure from 
traditional sports, winning is 
deemphasized in favor of par-
ticipation. Since losing alienates 

people, the games ' creators 
reasoned that rules should be 
easily changeable . to make the 
event safer, fairer or more In-
teresting. 

The tournament aspect should 
not be ignored. There will be at 
least three games going on at once-
-including a variation on volleyball 
and games with earthballs and 
parachutes-as well as non-active 
events like cooperative checkers. 

As participation is a key to the 
New Games' success, Revelle 
College assistant dean Mary 
Dhooge, the prime mover behind 
the UCSD tournament, emphasizes 
the event is for the entire family, 
not just students, she also advises 
that participants wear; old, rough-
and-tumble clothing. 

The tournament is being spon-
sored by the four colleges, the 
psychology and counseling 
department, the Recreation Center 
and Groundwork Collective. 

Look out. It's time for functional clothes that make you 
look as good as you feel. Jumpsuits. They fit like you're. wearing 
nothing at all. Yet you're dressed for show and go. They're daytime, 
nighttime, boogietime fashions . And jumpsuit dressing looks dynamite 
together. 

FOR HER. Our button front, belted jumpsuit by Foxy 
Lady. Fine looking in carefree cotton. Add a tee with a French accent 
and a color coordinated cotton scarf and you're et to take off. 

FOR HIM. Finally, a good looking jumpsuit that's supe r 
adjustable. Fits all men, all sizes, thanks to the elastic waist. In black or 
white cotton, with zip top pockets and zippered front, you're in and out 
of it in a flash .

.............................. : .. s.~a. .. 

In 1972 UaD students, In a 
C8IIlpUoWide referendum, voted 
the traditional elected Associated 
Student government out of 
existence. After two different 
incarnations in u many years, 
UCSD's student government 
emerged in a somewhat more 
stable form as the Student 
Cooperative, a government 
without the traditional elected 
hierarchy. 

Instead, the Coop - which is now 
Imown as the Student Cooperative 
Union - works on a style of con-
sensus decision-making and so 
must draw i~ support from aU 
members of the campus com-
munity. All students are eligible to 
vote at the weekly town-hall style 
meetings. 

Instead of the traditional elected 
positions, the Coop is divided into 
Action Centth, which study issues 
of immediate student concern and 
support groups which carry on the 
day-to-day functions of govern-
ment. 

The Coop has been a center of 
controversy during its short 
existence, with some students 
ardenUy defending its idealistic 
principles and others condemning 
it as a group ripe with corruption. 

-It survived one student referen-
dum - of the same sort that 
obliterated ASUCSD in 1972 - in the 
spring of 1974 and there are rumors 
of a similar vote this Fall. 

The Appointments and 
Evaluation support group, coor-
dinated by Mark Fingennan, is 
responsible for Coop appointments 
to campus-wide governance 
corrunittees. These committees are 
composed of faculty, adÂ· 
ministrators, and students. 
Decisions which directly affect the 
quality of university life are 
considered in a broad spectrum of 
areas including student serVices, 
academic affairs , community 
planning and business operations. 
Student input ranges from equal 
participation in a collabrative 
effort to a singular advisory 
capacity. 

The External Affairs support 
group is charged with representing 
UCSD students in the local com-
munity and in all statewide 
organizations. Acting as a voice for 
the Coop, the External Affairs . 
coordinator holds speaking 
priveges during meetings of the 
governing Board of Regents and 
serves as a voting member of the 
student Body Presidents Council 
(SBPC). 

SBPC consists of representatives 
from undergraduate and graduate Â· 
student governments on the nine 
UC campuses. Communicating 
student needs and formulating 
systemwide student response, this 
council interacts with University 
Hall administration, the Statewide 
Academic Senate and the state 
legislature. 

The council is divided into two 

Taelday, SeptelDber 11, 1171 

major committees - budget and 
penonnel. Monitoring the process 
for areas of student concern, the 
budget committee follows UC 
business operations and fund 
allocation requests. The personnel 
committee makes decisions on 
applicants for Presidential 
Advisory Task Forces, Student 
Regent, and the UC Student Lobby. 

SBPC is responsible for ap-
.pointing students to Presidential 
Advisory Task Forces. These task 
forces are composed of faculty, 
administrators, and students who 
generate recommendations in 
areas of special University need as 
identified by President Saxon. 
Recent Task Forces have explored 
instructional improvement, ad-
missions, financial aid ad-
ministration, and student par-
ticipation in university gover-
nance. From this campus Mark 
Fingennan has been nominated to 
work on the.Student Participation 
Task . Force along with Vice 
Chancellor of Student Services, 
George Murphy. This last year 
Provost Joe Watson of Third 

. College participated on the 
Admissions Task Force which 
examined objective and subjective 
criteria for admittance of qualified 
students to the UC system. 

The UC Student Lobby - located 
in Sacramento - operates as the 
information agency for SBPC. 
Under the direction of the council, 
the lobby writes proposed laws, 
provides information for the 
legislative process, and supports 
or opposes bills which directly 
affect UC students. 

The major thrust of lobby ac-
tivity has been educational policy 
and funding. The lobby is currently 
working for the completion of 
UCSD's Third College Academic 
Step II, which has been identified 
as a statewide issue of concern. 

Three full-time co-directors, 
assisted by student interns from 
each UC campus, staff constitute 
the lobby staff. Their main duties 
are to testify in legislative com-
mittee hearings and to .make 
personal contact with legislators 
on issues concerning UC. 

The lobby's effectiveness has 
been ranked by a state newspaper 
as equal to such highly-funded 
organizations as the California 
Teachers' Association and Bank of 
America . 

Presiding over the UC system is 
the Board of Regents, who are 
appointed by the Governor. Until 
1974, the board had no student 
members. In that year California 
voters approved a proposition, 
which allowed a student regent. 

The student regent is nominated 
by the SBPC from an array of 
applicants from the UC campuses. 
This student is not a represen-
tative, but a trustee who shares 
equally with other Regents in the 
responsibility of governing the 
University.

by Alaa HlllleD 

New. Editor 
San Diego-America'sflnest city. 

Was it less than 150 years ago when 
French ' traveller and writer 
Duhart-Cilly called San Diego the 
saddest place in california, ex-
cepting San Pedro? 

It was. 
Believe it or not, San Diego has 

not always been the renowned 
mecca of sun and surf. In fact, the 
breathtaiing beauty of San Diego 
was often overlooked or forgotten 
in the midst of other landscapes. 
Observe the words of a newly 
arrived 1865 schoolteacher. "Of all 
the dilapidated, miserable looking 
places I had ever seen, this was the 
worst. The buildings were nearly 

all adobe, one story in height, with 
no chimneys. " 

So how did San Diego become 
America's finest city? Ah, listen 
my childre. and you shall 
hear ........ 

Juan Rodriguez cabrillo was the 
first white man to sight San 
Diego's shores. In September, 1542, 
he sailed his two small Spanish 

Navy ships into San Diego Bay, one 
of the finest natural harbors in the 
world. The explorer left his vessel 
to claim the land for the flag of 
Castille and Aragon, and after 
staying for some days on the coast 
with his men, they returned to the 
ship and travelled northwards to 
explore more. 

NamJng of San Diego 
It was 60 years before another 

major expedition arrived in San 
Diego. Don Sebastian Viscaero 
entered the harbor in 1602, and he 
is the gentleman credited witll 
giving the city its present ap-
pelation. The name of San Diego 
was believed to be given in honor of 
San Diego de Alcala (St. James of 
Alcala), or perhaps for a certain 
St. Didacus of the Latin calendar. 

The third large excursion into 
San Diego didn't occur until 1769. 
Three expeditions arrived in May, 
June, and July, with the last one 
being the most important, as it 
brought our first settlers. The 
weary, limping Franciscan priest 
Junipero Serra and 64 other men 
arrived on July 14. 

As in medieval times, it was 
necessary to build upon a high 
point, so that the position might 
easily be defended. Serra chose 
" Middling High Hill," what is now 
known as Presidio Hill in Old 
Town, as his site for a mission. On 
July 16, 1769, Serra gave a mass, 
and San Diego was dedicated to 
civilization. The mass was 
celebrated with an ac-
companiment of gunfire. We were 
off the a banging start. The date is 
now remembered as San Diego's 
first birthday. 

After the military men buIlt 
some huts, almost all of them 
departed for Monterey, leaving the 
Padres the task of "civilizing" the 
natives. By all accounts, it wasn't 
easy. 

The Native Americans here, 
known as the Diegueno Indians, 
had more interest in the white 
man's cloth than his religion. In 
fact they desired the material so 
much that they had a small one day 
war with the settlers in hopes of 
getting more. They were driven 
back, but one servant boy of the 
Padres was killed. 

Few written records of im-
portance mentioned anything 
happening in the next six years. 
Those things written a bout the 
Indians could not be called com-

plimentary. The Diegueno's only 
comment was a November, 1775 
uprising; their first and essentially 
last attack agalnst the mission. 
The cause of the sudden fight was 
not known, and the only tangible 
result was the death of several 
men. 

The years 'passed rather quietly, 
though Amer ic an -S panish 
hostilities were noted as early as 
1803 in San Diego. Mexican In-
dependence occured from Spain in 
1821 , and San Diego automatically 
became a Mexican colony. At the 
time, Mexico really didn't care 
much about a flea overrun " city" 
which consisted of those buildings 
housed behind the adobe walls of 
the garrison on Presidio Hill. 

The calvalry Arrives 
Not much happened in San Diego 

until Americans decided California 
should be theirs. Even then it 
seemed that not much happened. 
San Diego was captured by United 
states proclamation, and there 
was no bloodshed. The California 
Battalion of Volunteers arrived in 
San Diego on the Sloop Cyane on 
July 29, 1846. Captain Samuel F. 
Dupont, with 160 marines and 
scouts, including notables such as 
John C. Fremont and Kit Carson, 
claimed San Diego for California. 
Carson himself raised the first 
American flag in California by 
hoisting it up on the mast-head in 
the town plaza . 

An anti-climax was the Battle of 
San Gabriel which more or less 
ended the war in favor of the 
Americans on January 13,1847. 

The Monnon Battalion Census of 
1847 told us that there were, " 248 
white persons, 483 tame Indians, 
1550 wild Indians, three egroes, 
and three Sandwich Islanders" 
living in San Diego. Cultural ac-
tivities of the time included cock-
fights, horse races, and frequent 
bull and bear fights . Sunday's were 
festive occasions, with parties 
always following church. 

Then it happened. In 1850 
California became a state . San 
Diego was the first county to be 
created in California. The same 
year it was incorporated as a 
regular town. Joshua Bean became 
the mayor, polling 87 votes in San 
Diego, and 68 in La Playa. Eat your 
heart out, Pete Wilson. 

In 1850 there were three prac-
ticing attorneys in San Diego and a

When Fr. Junlpero Serra 
founded the Miaaion San Diego de 
Alcala in 1789, he had no Idea that 
his little Spanish outpost would 
someday be the ninth largest city 
fI. the most powerful nation in the 
world. 

Now the second largest city in 
California, San Diego has un-
dergone monumental change in the 
12 years UC San Diego has been a 
part of the community. In that 
time, San Diego has mushroomed 
in size and importance. Once 
merely a navy port and quiet 
resort city south of Los Angeles, 
the metropolitan area now sup-
ports a large educational and 
research conununity, is the largest 
naval port in the Pacific, and is one 
of the major convention and tourist 
meccas in the nation. 

Of course, no matter how im-
pressive these statistics may be, 
the casual observer may wonder 
what the city is really like. 

To some, San Diego is merely 
one long series of pleasant beaches 
where thousands gather daily to 
playfully soak up the sun, sail in 
the Mission or San Diego Bay or to 
go fishing. 

Others fi course come to San 
Diego to escape the rat-races fI. 
their own hem. and have created 
instead a more enJoy.bIe one, â¢ 
mildly frenzied lifestyle that 
mlrron successfully, the harried 
tnafflc jams and the buaWng 
streets. 

To those who seek the exotic 
flavor of an alien culture, San 
Diego Is just the last stop in 
familiar territory before entering 
Old Mexico where the impossible 
dream still exists in the faint hope 
of Agua Caliente's ~10 Racetrack 
betting or the fevered wagering 
surrounding the quick games of 
Jai-Alai that occur in Tijuana's 
Fronton Palacio. For those who 
don't go to the dogs, the bullfights 
in the Downtown and Beach 
Bullrings offer another diversion 
while the relatively wild expanses 
of Baja California's 18nd excite 
those who fancy themselves af-
ficionados of outdoor life. 

For those who live and work in 
San Diego, such diversions are but 
a small part of their lives in what 
the civic fathers call .tfAmerica's 
Finest City." 

Despite one of the highest levels alriblliSin.ess the third most im-
of unemployment in the nation San industry in San Diego 
Diego continues to attract a throng -.lInLV. 
of people to work for the Navy, 
serve in the Tourist industry, and 
to be employed by the growing anrtp.r,ate 
number of research and education-
related institutions. 

While those are the industries it is the climate that 
that attract the most attention, .COUragE~<l people to stay in San 
agriculture continues to be one of they visit the city while 
San Diego's major businesses. , here on business or 
Avocado ranching, tomatoes, a tourist. 
citrus, and dairy products make makes possible the 

tourist industry which in tum 
makes San Diego a highly 
demanded place to live in. 

Among the more interesting 
features in San Diego is Balboa 
Park, a lush expanse fI. pastoral 
beauty in the heart of the city. 

Balboa Park was first buDt way 
back in 1916 for the Pan-American 
exposition and was later expanded 
for the California Pacific 
Exposition of 1935. Many of the 
buildings erected for these two 
fetes still remain and serve to give 
the Park its unique architectural 
flavor. 

The most famous tenant of the 
park however, is not one of the 
many museums or botanical 
gardens, but Is the repository for 
the world's most varied collection 
of animals. The San Diego Zoo is 
generally regarded as one of the 
world's finest. 

Also in Balboa Park Is the world 
famous Old Globe Theatre. This 
replica of Shakespeare's theatre is 
the host every swruner for the 
reknown Shakespeare Festival. 
During the rest of the year drama 
lovers are served a variety of fare 
in its two intimate theaters. 

In addition to the Old Globe, the 
San Diego area has a large number 
of theaters providing a diverse 
dramatic backgroWld. In addition, 
many national touring companies 
visit San Diego's Civic Theatre, 
wblch is alBo the home of the San 
Diego Symphony, the San Diego 
Opera Company, and many other 
local groups. 

For those who are athletically 
inclined, San Diego is the nation's 
golf mecca with scores of courses 
throughout the county. Other 
sports enthusiasts will find their 
favorite activity somewhere in the 

â¢ County if one looks hard enough. 
Spectator sports are also 

provided as major league teams in 
baseball (Padres ), football 
(Chargers), hockey (Mariners) 
and tennis (Friars), volleyball 
(Breakers) , and womens softball 
(Sandpipers) compete with San 
Diego's fun in the sun for support. 
For those who would rather follow 

. big-time college athletics than 
participate in UCSD's lOW-key 
programs, the San Qiego State 
Aztecs field very competitive 
teams in most intercollegiate 
sports. 

We are offering discussion groups in comics, science 
fiction and literature. We might have that hardÂ·to-find book.

From atop his steely ferris wheel 
perch Don Diego, the hwnan 
symbol of California's City in 
Motion, radiates avocad~hued 
photons of year-round-best-climate 
hospitality to all weary travellers

It's so easy to like San Diego, 
they say-sun, surf and a mayor 
who looks 14. And why argue? 

San Diego, however, Is stlll an 
American city of 1976: reality 
intrudes even into the Land of 
Manana. For those new to the area, 
a trip to Horton Plaza, located on 
Broadway between Third and 
Fourth Streets in downtown San 
Diego, is recorrunended. 

larger stores have been leaving 
DOwntown for years, heading to 
newer, classier regions oftl)e city. 

It is true that the financial 
district remains and that such 
finns as Charter Oil and the 
Wickes Corporation have raised 
impressive metal and glass office 
monoliths here recentiy, but as far 
as the business of the Common 
Man goes, such establishments as 
the US Cafe and Old Doc Webb's 
Tattoo Parlor are much more 
representative.

traffic thickens, and you are drawn 
to the urban nerve center that Is 
Horton Plaza. Â·In terms of current 
civic value, it is chiefly notable as 
a major transfer point for bus 
riders. 

But it is a much more significant 
landmark than that, for it bears 
the name of Alonzo E. Horton, a 
forgettable but nonetheless vitally 
important figure in the develop-
ment of what was later to be call 
"Richard Nixon's Lucky City" (he 
carried it in every election he ran 

. in, from 1950 to 1972) . 

It will help to remind you that,

UCID Tradition LlvIS 

by Alu RaueU 
New. EdItor 

This is a traditional story. 
Nat\H'8Uy, it deals with traditions 
at UC San Diego. 

We live in a world steeped in 
tradition. . What . would 
Thanksgiving be like without a 
turkey? Would Christmas be the 
same sans Santa Claus or 
Christmas trees? And imagine 
Easter without the Easter Bwmy: 
little children would view that 'as 
sacre,Jlgious. 

Each year the world celebrates 
colorful traditions. The bulls are 
still running through the streets of 
Pamplona with men just ahead of 
their waving horns. Observe 
England's yearly foofaraw on Guy 

The remnants of Reuelle's annual 
wa termelon drop. 

Fawkes Day (Fawkes was an 
Engliab conspirator who was 

. eIecuted for participating in the 
1605 Gunpowder Plot, a little 
conspiracy which had high hopes of 

blo~lng up the king and both 
Houses of Parliament), The 
Gennans drink all sorts ol beer 
during ' their Octoberfest, and the 
Russians show off their missiles on 
May Day (while on the same May 
first in other countries children 
dance around a maypole). 

Some traditions span thousands 
of years (most notably spring 
festivals), while others only seem 
that way (the Chargers in last 
place). UCSD, in only its thirteenth 
year of undergraduate programs, 
already sports several notable 
traditions. 

Watermelou Drop 
Our oldest and best known 

tradition is the Revelle "water-
melon drop. II This event was 
initiated iMocently enough from a 
physics final. It seems that the 
professor wanted to know the 
extent of a watermelon splat, if it, 
weighing a certain amount, was 
dropped from a specified height. 
Naturally, some students weren't 
satisfied with only t he 
mathematics. More proof was 
required. So they dropped the 
bomb. A watermelon from Urey 
Hall that is. 

The watermelon drop has grown 
greatly since that initial 1964 
testing. A raucous aHair in late 
May results in the choosing of a 
freshman Revelle " watermelon 
queen, II The last several years 

' have seen some males of 
questionable dressing mores at-
tempt to gain the title, but as of yet

Thrills and excitement on the way to the fin ish line in Mu ir College's Trike Race. 

females have always worn the 
seedy crown. 

Resplendant in garb of water-
melon, the queen walks ' through 
Revelle Plaza and over to Urey 
Han ca.rrying a watermelon. There 
she climbs to the top floor of the 
balcony, and in the, sight of 
thousands, drops her burden earth-
ward towards a roped off area. The 
object? To send watermelon bits 
from here to the Gobi Desert. The 
current record was set in 1975 with 
a splat of 167 feet, 4 inches, 

As might De expecte<1, water-
melon . is served afterwards. 

Trike Race 

Another big tradition at UCSD is 
the Muir trike races . This event 

has been growing every year, with 
record entries-and obstacles. 

Spectators get to watch frenzied 
peddlers doused with water, 
upended by sundry devious 
potholes, and generally hwniliated 
in almost every way possible. 

Naturally, it is all great fun. 
San Diego celebrities like the 

KGB Chicken and Captain Sticky 
add flavor to the affair. In recent 
years new wrinkles have been 
added, like having the deans of all 
four colleges take their spills while 
defending their school's honor. 

Pie eating contests, and various 
other forms of the day's en-
tertainment leave most amused, if 
not satiated. 

comp'~+~ 

The pragmatic newcomers at 
Fourth College, the latest school to 
enter the tradition bandwagon, 
upset purists by instituting a 
" Tradition Day." 

Held last spring for the first time 
under inclement weather con-
ditions, it was nonetheless a suc-
cess. Teams competed for the 
" provost's cup" by vrmg in such 
sporting activities as treasure 
hunts and volleyball . King Neptune 
even made an appearance out of 
the sea. Bigger and better things 
are promised in Fourth's u~ 
coming Tradition Days. 

Tradition at UCSD? You bet, 
with more waiting to be stumbled 
upon. Now let's just hope there are 
no Guy Fawkes' out there.

Incidentally, Central, unlike the

quiet place to study. 

Another good place to study, if 
you prefer the outdoors, is the 
rolling lawn behind the Hwnanities 
Library. 

The sun is usually warm, the 
trees provide shade and very few 
people are around to disturb the 
solitude.

in the ground floor of. Urey Hall.

help you out. 

On-Campus Hang Oat 
H you're looking for some non- , 

institutional food, the ever-popular 
Coffee Hut is the place to go. If 
there is an on-carnpus hang out, 
this could well be it. Lpcated 
among the eucalyptus trees down 
the hill from the Revelle Provost's 
office, the Hut is more out of the 
way than the other campus snack 
bars, but worth the walk. 

For food and entertainment at 
night, visit the Muir Five and Dime 
or the Revelle Side Door. The Five 
and Dime has a coffee house at-
mosphere and serves food after 
everything else is closed. The Side 
Door features student performers 
while offering coffee, tea and 
doughnuts.

Bulldl 1111111 

Muir College's Writing Program, 
which is beginning this fall, offers 
two levels of instruction for en-
tering freshmen, College Writing 
(Muir lOA, B) and Advanced 
College Writing (Muir 20). Both 
are 4-unit workshop courses 
designed to fulfill Muir 's 
graduation requirement that 
students "demonstrate an ability 
to write English according to 
standards appropriate for all 
college work. " 

While Muir 10 builds from per-
sonal and narrative writing 
towards basic ellpOBltory skills, 
Muir 20 provides more advanced 
training in the argwnentative, 
analytical and critical writing 
required for later undergraduate 
papers and essays. Smallsedions, 
weekly writing and revision, in-
dividual cooferences, and group 
critiquing are important features 
of both courses. 

Most Muir freshman wilLtake 
lOA B (successful completion of 
which will also satisfy the 
University-wide Subject A 
requirement); and enroll in Muir 20 
in their sophomore year; however, 
freshman who score 600+ in the 
English Composition Test and 
transfers who have already taken a 
quarter of writing will normally 
take Muir 20 in their first year. In 
future quarters it may be possible 
for returning students of all classes 
to enroll in Muir 20 in order to 
strengthen their college writing 
skills. For further Wormation call 
452-2522 or visit the Muir Writing 
office in 1254 H-L. 

Clinic In IIllh 
'.ar 

The Writing Clinic, now in its 
sixth year at UCSD, provides free 
assistance with any kind of, writing 
to all members of the University 
Community. Although most of its 
clients are undergraduates 
wanting help on course papers, 
staff members, graduate students 
and professors have sought help 
with resumes, grant proposals, 
dissertations, and scholarly ar-
ticles. 

The counselors, Barbara Behar 
and Carmen Schoensee, meet 
clients on an appoinbnent basis for 
an hour at a time. The only 
requirement is that clients have 
some writing project they want 
help with. The kind of help 
received ranges from talking over 
ideas preliminary to writing, to 
line-by-Une editing of a near final 
draft. For infonnatlon or to make 
an appointment, call 452-2522 or 
drop in at 1254 Humanitles-

Consumer COOPS: 
Allernatlve Services lor Siudenis 

Consumer cooperatives : an effort by people to help 
their fellow human beings in basic areas of concern. 
Coops have sprung up all over the nation in different 
forms, as people's food stores, neighborhood 
bookshops and in any other area where people desire 
an alternative to the established channels of 
operation. 

At UCSD student consumer coops offer members of 
the university community alternatives in food, 
bookshops, bicycle repairs and printing service. 
There are currently five such coops : Groundwork 
Books, the Print Coop, the Bike Shop, the Food Coop 
and the Book Coop. All are operated by students and 
try to offer vital services at a discount. 

, 

Groundwork is a bookstore, a center for political 
discussion and events. Its basic purpose, collective 
members say, " is to work toward ending exploitation 
and helping people take more control over their 
lives. " 

While the collective's main function is making 
available books relating to social change-on political 
thought and the movements for women, workers, 
gays, blacks, Chicanos and native americans-at a 6 
percent discount, it has other functions , including the 
fonnation of study. groups on varied issues and the 
playing of political music the first Saturday night of 
every month. 

Groundwork is holding an open house this Satur-

day. from 2 to 5 pm, at their shop on the Student 
Center's south side. 

Located next to Groundwork is the Print Coop, 
which offers a small quick center, "with very low 
prices and lots of careful service." In addition to the 
copying services, the coop is always expanding. At 
present, it is ready to handle artwork, collating, 
folding, sunple binding and cutting. 

The coop also schedules small workshops on offset 
printing and graphic layout for people who want to 
learn about printing. 

The third section of the building housing three 
consumer coops is the Bike Shop, which offers all the ' 
services of a regula r bike repair shop at "highly 
competitive prices." The biggest savings are in labor 
costs, which are sometimes half that of local bike 
stores. 

The Bike Shop is open Monday through Saturday 
from 10 am to 5 pm. 

The Food and Book Coops will be opening as school 
begins. The Book Coop-located in the Revelle Dining 
Commol'llH)ffers used textbooks and other books at 
substantial savings. The Food Coop features a 
variety of food and beverages at cut rates at its 
location in the Game Room next to the Muir Five and 
Dime.

when the recutst for a letter to the

Graduate Studies and Research 
(OGSR). Hh:: staff volunteered to 
prepare this message in his place.) 

Graduate study at U~D is a 
kaleidOllCope of chaUenges and 
frustrations, structure and 
freedom, independent study and 
collaboration with faculty, of 
classrooms, laboratories and 
libraries, of progress forward, and 
progress back. We welcome you, 
old and new alike, to this ever-
changing world of people and 
ideas. 

The Dean of Graduate Studies 
and Research (OGSR) , Manny 
Rotenberg, is the calm in the 
center of this activity. 

He oversees the administrative 
aspects of graduate studies at San 
Diego, while trying to not lose sight 
of the problems which affect you 
and graduate studies in general. 
This year we are fortunate in being 
able to welcome our new Associate 
Dean, Professor Gabriel Jackson. 

The staff in the Office of 
Graduate Studies and Research 
(OGSR), MC-lOS are -willing and 
able to help with many of the 
problems graduate students ex-

just keeping recorda and impoIing 
requirements - it II senaitive to 
Issues that affect gradu.te 
students (academic, financial. 
etc.) and represents their interests 
in many ways. 

The experience of being a 
graduate student is, above aU, a 
personal one. The more you put 
into the world around you, the 
more you get out of it. Arid this 
meam your experience as a 
graduate student will be more 
valuable as you' personally par-
ticipate in those activities, both 
inter- and intra-departmental, 
which foster a sense of community 
among graduate students. 

One such activity, which is 
devoted to graduate issues of a 
general nature, is the Graduate 
Student Council. The GSC is an 
independent, representative 
organization of graduate students 
which takes issues of concern to 
graduate students to OSGR, to the 
Administration, to the Regents or 
to the general public. More than 
likely, something that the GSC has 
done or is planning to do will have a 
positive effect on the experience 
you face this year. 

Women's Center Faces 
Problems, Issues 

by Leslie Larson 
Staff writer 

Opening this fall as a student 
organization, UCSD's Women's 
Center is a resource center for 
students interested in aquainting 
themselves and becoming involved 
in women-oriented problems and 
issues. 

The center, staffed by student 
volunteers, will offer a selection of 
books, magazines and pamphfets 
dealing with women-related in-
terests. It will also sponsor 
programs dealing with women's 
art, medical information for 
women and attitudes held by and 
about women. 

The center will be open daily 
from 11:00 until 3:00 until classes 
begin. 

Tentative programs planned by 
the Center include a year long 
sequence on seH-defense, con-
sciousness raising, assertiveness . 
training, poetry readings and 
lectures on legal aid, women and 
credit, and birth control. 

Also operating out of the Center 
is the Feminist Coalition, which 
will meet to deal with specific 
issues such as the Equal Rights 
Amendment, child care, 
lesbianism and rape. 

The Women's Center will have a 
display at the Bizarre Bazaar 
Thursday afternoon to give 
students a chance to become 
acquainted with its functions. 

The center will be open daily 
from 11:00 until 3:00 until classes 
begin.

SIUdy Help 

By Peter Uchty 

OASIS, the Office of Academic 
Support and Instructional services, 
offers students several programs 
to help with studying problems. 

One workshop is for students 
lacking basic study skills. Reading 
speed and comprehension are 
covered in another, and note-
taking, time managment, reading 
strategies and test-taking are 
covered In a thlrO. A sign-up sheet 
is in the OASIS office, in the 
Student Center's Building B. 

OASIS offers three alternatives 
for students needing help with a 
specific course. Those students 
desiring only occasional help will 
find it in the Math/Physics or the 
Biology/Chemistry clinics, which 
are staffed by experienced OASIS 
tutors and assist students on both a 
waik-in and an apPointment basis. 

Small tutorial sections are of-
fered for students needing more in-
depth tutoring. A section consists 
of ten classmates meeting with a

Center Oilers Student 
Health Care SaVings 

by Sara J. Lowen 
Special writer 

Students will spend substantially 
less money on health care if they 
make use of the heAlth services 
offered by the :ltudent Health 
Center instead of going to a private 
physician, according to a staff 
nurse at the center. 

The center is set up to minister to 
most student health needs, 
providing some services free of 
charge and others at a cost less 
than that charged by private 
physicians. 

Free Services 
With a full time staff of 

physicians, the center gives first 
aid treabnent, infirmary care and 
consultation on minor health 
problems at no charge. A staff 
physician will arrange for students 
to see a specialist or undergo 
hospitalization, if it is necessary. 

The costs for hospitalization, 

specialists, laboratory tests and x-
rays are usually covered by the 
student Health Insurance Plan, 
which all students pay for through 
their Registration Fees. 

Other services offered by the 
center include dental care and eye 
examinations, as well as the 
dispensing and repairing of 
glasses. These services are not 
covered by the health insurance 
plan, but are offered at a reduced 
rate. Students can also have 
prescriptions written by staff 
members filled at the center's 
pharmacy at a cost much less than 
commercial phannacies charge. 

No Physicals 

TRiTON ClAssifiEds 

The three major services not 
offered by the center are routine 
physical check-ups , care for 
medical conditions or injuries 
incurred before his coverage under 
student health insurance began 
and extended psychiatric treat-
ment (though a physician may 
refer a student to a consulting 
psychiatrist). 

The Student Center staff has 
published an almanac which 
details the services it alfers, ex-
plains the coverage under the 
student health insurance plan and 
includes a guide to first aid. PERSONAls

Sport_ editor 

Attending UC San Diego in order 
to further one's career in athietics 
is about as effective as, weU, about 
as effective as a prospective doctor 
corresponding with a school ad-

vertised inside matchbooks as a 
means to acquire a pre mid-school 
biology degree. Yeah, it can be 
done, but there are better ways. 

Nationally-ranked teams, All-
Americans, mass media coverage, 
pro scouts, and wildly enthusiastic 
fan support is hardly a part of 
UCSD's intercollegiate athletics. 
Occasionally a Randy Miller 
pitches weU enough to sign with the 
Baltimore Orioles, a MaUory 
Mitchell generates enough elt-
citement on the basketball court to 
fill the Main Gym, or the soccer 

team qualifies ' for the NAlA 
district playoffs, but, for the most 
part, athletes and athletic teams at 
U~D enjoy only very moderate 
results and recognition while 
maintaining a rather autonomous 
existence both on campus and 
within the San Diego area. 

Hell, there isn't Â· even a football 
team here. 

"This frigging dive is per-
meated with so much scientific 
backfire and intellectual hogwash 
that it doesn't give scat about in-
tercollegiate sports! " 

Is that "The Problem?" 
No. There Is no problem. 
Because, you see, the middling 

status of U~D's intercollegiate 
athletics is the result of a basic 
direction chosen by the athletic 
department and students alike. 
The direction is one ainled at

student participation, not at the 
Winning-Is-Everything Attitude 
now common at many colleges 
around the country. 

DUfereDt Emphasis 
"We do not have the same em-

phasis as other collegiate athletic 
factories," says UCSD athletic 
director, Judy S~eet, one of the 
few women to hold such a position 
at a major university. " Our main 
concern is promoting participation 
and involvement. The emphasis is 
not on winning at all costs, but on 
improvement of each athlete. " 

The approach is different. 
Indeed, by the professed goals of 
U~D's intercollegiate athletics 
the program here is very much a 
winner. The numbers attest to this 
success. There are now a total of 
thirty men's, women's, and coed 
intercollegiate teams competing 
for UCSD. Over twelve per cent of 
all the students enrolled last year 
performed for these leams, more 
than twice the percentage of any 
other UC campus. 

Yet the program operates on the 
diminutive sum of $105,000. This 
amount compares with multi-
million dollar budgets employed at 
schools like UCLA and Berkeley at 
which only 2-3% of the students 
participate in intercollegiate 
sports. " But we aren't trying to do 
the same things as those schools," 
says Sweet.

by Scott SadU 
Sports editor 

It's six in the morning, the first 
day of another school quarter, and 
God knows any sane person would 
be in bed, or surfing, or playing 
golf, or, at least, sitting red-eyed 
over a cup of coffee and the San 
Diego UnJota sports page wishing it 
was the LA Times. 

-"Hey, Panch, how was your 
summer?"-

But, no, you're standing, stan-
ding! on the polished woorlen floor 
in the Main Gym; standing in line 
behind thirty hard-core tennis 
fanatics; standing while they sit 
because they are such old pros at 
this that they remembered to bring 
pillows and cushions and chairs to 
wait in line with; standing, trying 
to hold your place while the line 
builds behind you and someone 
shoves and pushes and the third 
gorgeous blonde you've seen this 
morning gets cuts at the front of 
the line; standing, wondering, 
really, why am I here? 

Because you want to enroll in 
Physical Education course number 
14C, Tennis-Intermediate Strokes, 
that's why. 

So you're standing. 
Class sign-ups don't begin until 

7:30, but you learned last year that 
you have to get to the gym early if 
you hope to get into the class you 
want. 

â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢ 

"Where's the line for the tennis 
classes?" 

" It's gone. All the tennis classes 
are full." 

"But it's only eight o'clock! " 
"Sorry. " 

â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢ 

And it is first come, first serve, 
which is the oldest joke in this n~ 
good, ass-biting tennis line. You 
can get on a waiting list if the class 
fills up, hoping for a No-Show, but 
that's like being the fourth number 
picked in the Reader's Digest 
Sweepstakes where "you get the 
grand prize of $25,000 if the other 

~OF 
LA JOLLA 

three contestants fail to pick up the 
money in the next 90 days." 

â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢ 

"But I gotta get into a tennis 
class! I just bought an Arthur Ashe 
Head racket, Stan Smith Adidas, a 
Wilt Chamberlain headband, two 
shirts with penguins on them, and a 
pair of Nasty Shorts." 

"Sorry." 
â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢ 

You check again for your student 
ID card, you can't get into a class 
without it, because they have to 
know who you are, plus make sure 
that you don't sign up for anyone 
else. -Ha! Just let someone try 
that ... 

â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢ 

"Sorry." 
" Oh well, I guess I'll just take the 

beginning volleyball class." 
"I'm sorry, all the volleyball 

classes are closed. " 
" How about handball?" 
"Sorry, closed. " 
"Swi.mmi.ng? " 
"Sorry." 
" Fencing!" 
"Sorry. " 
" Well what the-" 
" Uh, 'have you been injured 

lately? There are still some 
openings in a couple of the Applied 
Rehabilitation courses." 

. ..... 

But it is probably the best way 
for giving everyone an equal 
chance, an equally bad chance 
some may say, for filling up the 
limited number of openings in each 
PE class. No one, upperclassmen, 
sixt~year seniors, grad students, 
no one is favored in the sign-up 
process. You either sacrifice the 
last leg of your ride on the Sleep 
City Express in order to get the 
class you want, or you walk into the 
gym all bright-eyed and bushy-
tailed and sort through the left-
overs. 

7:30. Finally. The line begins to 
move. There is more pushing and 
shoving, but it's going to take a

Any and every student at UCSD 
can be actively involved In sports 
simply by becoming a part ~ the 
expansive intramural athletics 
program. 

Labellinllitself 81 "the nwnber 
one social happening on campus," 
IMs offer students the opportunity 
to meet aild be with other people, 
while simultaneously giving them 
the chance to enjoy lOme casual 
exercise and athletic competition. 

"We like to emphasize the social 
aspects of intramurals," says Lee 
Johnson, bead of the 1M depart-
ment. "Students are guaranteed of 
at least once a week getting the 
chance to have some fun with a 
large group of people. " 

Thousands of UCSD students 
participate in the 1M program each 
year. Teams compete in sports 
ranging from the usual (flag 
football and softball) to the more 
bizarre (innertube waterpolo and 

indoor soccer). And there are 
leagues for almost every sport-
coed, women's, and men'. teams. 

Everybody PlaY' 
The 1M program is not 

dominated by a group ~ frustrated 
jocks. UCSD's intramural 
philosophy dictates that anyooe 
who wants to patticioate wiD have 
the opportunity to play all the time. 
There art no bench warmers. High' 
levels of skill or previous sports 
experience is not important. In 
each sport, teams are matched by 
ablllty, and the leagues are 
arranged to meet the varying 
levels of competition. Therefore, in 
any game, a team has a good 
chance of winning since it wiD 
almost always be playing a team of 
equal ability. 

"But the main point of IMs," 
says Johnson, "is having fun and 
enjoying people, not winning. A lot 
of teams just like the chance to get

anyone interested in playing 1M 
sports. Here is the way to get in-
volved: 

Upon deciding what sport(s) you 
want to participate ln, the best 
course of action is to get together 
with other students and form a 
team. Since the main emphasis in 
intramurals is fun, it Is best to 
select people you enjoy. 

Once you have your team. select 
a captain or team representative. 
Send this person to the Intramural 
(1M) Office to 'pick up a roster 
sheet. List all team members and 
include everyone's pbone number. 

Check with the 1M office or the 
Triton Times for the time and 
place of the team meeting. Send 
your captain or team rep to the 
team meeting with your roster and 
you will then be scheduled into a 
league. 

Estimate how good your team Is 
so you can decide on the proper 
level of competition. Use your head 
and not your ego. Next, determine 
what playing times are best and 
what times are bad because of 
class conflicts. 

Leagues are formed by the 
caliber ~ play and available times. 
The reC department attempts, as 
much as possible, to arrange your 
schedules to include games the 
same day and same time each 
week (i.e., every Sunday at 11 
AM). 

If you do not have a team to play

the growth of cogent science and 
technology as well as the oltaining 
of .. more just, ethical; aesthetic 
and civilized community. 

The traditions of the 
Renaissance permeate and infuse 
the dreamS of the revellers in 
Revelle in the 19608 and 1970s. They 
force us to consider . the whole 
person and the wbole society, the 
wbole earth and tbe whole 
univene. They make us probe the 
relationship of science to society, 
the humane to the humanities, the 
real to the ideal~ liberal education 
to specialized education. They do 
not permit \IS to seUle on one 
solutioo or to be intellectually 
seduced by one experiment, one 
part of the whole. 

The Renaissance is a "heavy" 
tradition-undergirded as it is by 
the Medieval University and the 
shadows of Bacon, Da Vinci, and 
Erasmus- but it is one that courts 
excitement and excellence, reason 
and responsibility, freedom and 
ferment. It builds upon the idea 
that more than one ' branch of 

knowledge is worth knowiJ'le. and 
each is best known when learned in 
an integrated, balanced context. It 
reminds us of the counterpoint that 
knowledge is power and that ethics 
Is the essence of life. 

The first decade of Revelle 
College highlighted its uniqueness 
and' its tradition. Through its 
curriculum and college canÂ· 
figuration, it created an atÂ· 
mosphere that augured a 
renaissance in higher education. 
Being part of UC8D, Revelle's 
broad but defined set of 
requirements underscored the 
triple mission, sometimes imÂ· 
possible dream, of the true 
wdversiw: liberal yet specialized 
education, continuity yet 
coherence, responsibility yet 
unfettered curiosity. Its researc& 
cum-teaching curriculum, past 
and anticipated, aims to inform a 
comprehensive view-perhaps 
constructing vislonÂ·-of our 
changing universe. 

Today, excellence (the classical 
arete or virtu) in education and the 
development of competencies in 
the whole wolman are not trivial

I wish to warmly welcome our 

new students to the campus 88 well 
as welcome back aU of our con-
tinuing Students. 

Although it is a ~rtirularly 
hectic time for all students, I would 
recommend .that you set aside 
some time during the neJt few 
weeks to see your faculty advisor 
and visit the Third College 
Academic Advising and Dean's 
Offices . 

There have been a number of 
significant changes and additions 
to the college and the campus 
during the past several months. 
For example, there is now an 
extension ... : the Computer Center 
in Academic Unit I of Third 

CoUege; there have been several 
changes in ' our lower division 
course offerings and tbe 
requirements of several majors 
have been modified; Beverly 
Varga has been promoted to the 
position of Dean of Student Affairs 
in Third College; and by the time 
you read this letter a new Third 
College Assistant Dean will have 
been appointed. . 

So stop by to see us. It's a 
pleasant way for us to bring you up 
to date and answer any questions 
you may have. 

Best wishes for a successful and 
enjoyable academic year.

Get Higher MeAT Scores 

A recent study indicated that students who were tutors for the 
OASIS Provosts' Tutorial. Fellowship Program received 
significantly higher scores on the MeAT science subtest than 
did a matched group of non-tutors [O,ASIS Research Report No. 
6, August, 1976]. 

The study suggested that tutors received higher scores' 
because of two factors. 

The first was the tutor training course, "The Psychology of 
Teaching and the Structure of Information for Human learning," 
which is required of all tutors and provides information on 
teaching, le.aming, and the structure of information to facilitate 
leamlÂ·ng. This course Is deSigned to provide the skills necessary 
for tutors to efficiently teach other students how to learn and 
remember concepts In the lower division math or s~ience course 
that they tutor. . 

The review of the content constitutes the second factor 
supposedly responsible for Increases In the tutors' MCAT 
scores. Although more research Is neacled, the study concluded 
that "tutoring lower division science courses provides an ef-
fective method of review that appears to contribute to higher 
MCAT science subtestÂ·sCores for the tutors." 

You may become a tutor for' OASIS by going to the OASIS 
office in the Student Center Complex, Building B. Tutors are 
required to be junior or senior science majors with grade point 
averages of 3.00 or greater.

It baa been 72 years since ScrIPPl 
institution' of Oceanography (810) 
was fOl'lD8lly incorporated. It is 
now, and baa been for many years, 
the largest InatituUon of ita kind. It 
is also the oldest continuing in-
stitution In ita field being, for 
. example, 38 years older than 
Woods . Hole Oceanographic 
IDstitution. 

During this entire period it has 
been devoted to teaching, research 
and public service. The relative 
emphasis in each has been 
variable during the years. 
Obviously, durlngWorld War II the 
teaching component was low. Since 
World War n, however, the em-
phasis In the three areas has been 
about equal. 

Today the Institution is involved 
with just about every aspect of the 
oceans. This involvement carries 
the (810) activities all over the 
world, although the heaviest 
geographical concentration is in 
the Pacific and Indian oceans. The 
research carries from the Arctic to 
the Antarctic and to al1 the other 
world's oceans as well. 

Throughout its history Scripps 
has been In the forefront in 
research of the oceans; : however, 
the emphasis 'has increased in a 
series of steps-World War II 
brought heavy Navy involvement 
because of the requirements for 
defense against submarines. The 
failure of the sardine Industry in 
California brought a new plateau of 
activities. This, coupled with the 
burgeoning food requirements of 
the world, stimulated detailed 
study of the food cbaln, which 
historically bas been the basis for 
scientific ecology.

In recent years two additional 
impulses were genea:ated. The first . 
was a more widely perceived 
concern about the environment 
and the second was related to 
energy, its use, conservation and 
associated transportation 
problems. 

As of now the jump In activity is 
In the area of natural and man-
made environmental catastrophes 
- short-time climate changes, 
earthquakes ~nd the Introduction 
of hannful products Into the en-
vironment. 

One of the results of this con-
tinuingly Increasing pressure on 
the Institution has .been the 
sustained demand for its . 
graduates. In fact, SIO has been 
training students for the PhD 
degree from the very beginning -
the first person to receive her 
PhD based wholly on work at 810 
was-in 1920- about 17 years before

the first PhD was awarded at 
UCLA. 

Scripps graduates are found 
holding high positions in en-
vironmental affairs all over the 
world. At present the Institution 
supports approximately 180 
graduate students, split more or 
less unifonnly into most of the 
scientific disciplines. 

viie ui the resiAlts of the 
Institution's historical develo)r 
ment is the somewhat uniquely 
integrated internal structure. 
There is the Teaching Department, 
which is responsible for the 
educational function of the 
Institution. And there are the 
research divisions, such as Ocean 
Research, Geological Sciences and 
Marine Biology - this is a fairly 
normal structure. 

But there is a third layer of what 
can lososely be described as 
mission oriented groupings, such 
as the Marine Life Research 
Group, the Physiological Research 
Laboratory, the Visibility 
Laboratory and the Marine 
Physical Laboratory. In addition to 
these there are components of two 
systemwide organizations - the 
Institute of Geophysics & 
Planetary Physics and the 
Institute for Marine Resources. 

These are not ad hoc groups that 
were put together for a period of 
several years for some short Fange 
problem, but rather are devoted to 
analyzing and helping solve more 
or less permanent problems of long 
range. For example, the Marine 
Life Research group grew out 'of 
the State's problem with the 
disappearance of the sardine in-
dustry. It has since developed as a 
center of important activity in all 
those aspects related to the food 

chain and the California current 
system, plus a whole variety of ' 
related researches including 
climate and pollution. 

The Deep Sea Drilling project, 
which has been operating for 
nearly ten years, is the principal 
tool for exploiting the new concepts 
of plate tectonics and the geology 
associated with it.

are attainable by those students 
and scholars who see the con-
tradiction in a slogan like "over-
education" and who welcome the 
responsibility of educating for 
science, society, and humanity. At 
Revelle, you will find such 
colleagues in such a college and 
with a curriculum. Here both 
scientist and non-scientist are 
conversant with the problems and 
powers of the humanities, the arts, 
the social and behavioral sciences, 
mathematics, and the natural 
sciences. 

As the new Provost, I relish this 
commencement during Revelle's 
second decade and the opportunity 
to participate in the renewed 
building of a cohesive, competent, 
confident , and compassionate 
community of scholars and 
citizens. Along with you, I am awed

ton, however, who seem to bold 
the flDal power on tenure .. n-
dardl, say they feel the two 
quaUties should be considered 
equally. 

While this is the official line, 
many students feel research is 
considered the most important 
determinant. This would seem to 
be borne out by Vice-chancellor of 
~,,":~.$-~ir!l ~ ~ -
who stands as the immediate head 
ct UCSD faculty - who said in an 
lMerview last year that any 
profeasor who neglects his 
research in favor of teaching does 
not stand much chance of being 
tenured. 

Another important issue at 
UCSD - and at UC campuses all 
over the state - comes under the 
heading student power, or the right 
to student self-determination. 
Students are demanding more say 
in the plarming of their education, 
from the classroom to the ad-
ministrative offices. 

Such demands have been voiced 
since the sixties, and are usually 
met with token ' concessions that 
mean little in terms of actual 
determinative power. For that 
reason students are still asking for 
the same things: .a voice in 
curricular planning and a final say 
- rather than just advisory powers 

. - in the use of all student fee 
monies. They reason that, since it 
is their education and their fee 
money they should be allowed to 
determine its uses. 

Students Too Young? 
The most prevalent ad-

ministration answer to such 
demands is that, while ad-
ministrators are paid to ad-
ministrate and know what they are 
doing, students are still too young 
and inexperienced to competently 
handle such jobs. 

But how can anyone know for 
certain whether students are really 
too inexperienced in the mystic 
ways of administrating when they 
have never been given a chance to 
do so? Students could probably do 
a fine job determining student-

. need, if only because they can 
empathize with their peers. 

The movement for more self-
determination is taking shape in 
the UC system. Last winter student Â· 
leaders at several of the campuses 
began discussions on a proposed 
Registration Fee boycott, which 
theoretically would force UC ad-
ministrators to allow studerta a 
more direct voice in determination 
of student fee use. 

It remains to be seen how many 
students would jeopardize their 
educations by boycotting the Reg 
Fee. 

Somehow, it seems, through all 
its troubles and controversies, the 
university system keeps going, 
keeps graduating students every 
year. The question, though, is 
whether the institution is willing to 
adapt itself to alleviate the 
problems that are constantly 
pointed out. 

PlrDelDllI ... 
....... 

In keeping with the low-key 
approach to sporta, the in-
tercollegiate athletic department's 
only funding comes from student 
registration fees. There is no ad-
mission charge for students at-
tending athletic events at UCSD. 
Thus, no sport has a larger budget 
simply because ct greater tan 
a;meal or money-generat1Jlg 
potential. Instead, each sport is 
funded along the same set of 
guidelines, the actual amoWlt 
depending only on lengths of 
season, equipment and facility 
demands peculiar to a sport. 

Scholarships have alao been 
excluded from the UCSD athletic 
projU8m. Money goes towards 
every team member's benefit. No 
athlete is awarded privileged 
status. Everyone is a walk-on. 

So the All-Americans, the 
coverage by most of the media, 
and, yes, even more of the on-the-
score board victories go to other 
colleges and universities. UCSD 
simply offers athletes, practically 
any and all athletes who 80 desire, 
the chance to ccmpete in his or her 
sport as a part of their college 
education.

History 01 S.D .â¢â¢ 
new hotel. On May 29,1851, the:s&.: 
Diego Herald became the first 
published paper here. In 1852 the 
Masons established themselves 
here. That meant civilization. 
Matters progressed quickly. In 
1867 Alonzo E. Horton bought what 
was then referred to then as New 
Town, Horton's Addition, or South 
San Diego. For $267 he purchased 
what is presently called Downtown 
San Diego. . 

The San Diego (Old Town) of 
those days was hit by a disastrous 
fire in April, 1872. Migration to 
what is presently referred to as 
San Diego was thus expedited. 

The completion of the Santa Fe 
Railroad, development of water 
systems, the good word about San 
Diego's climate, and land 
speculation led to San Diego's 
rapid growth in the late 1800's.
