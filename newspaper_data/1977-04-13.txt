National Group Has Eyes in Sky

Look! Up in the sky, it's a bird, 
it's a plane, it's ... 

What the hell is it? 
Rob Garis, 22 year old UCSD 

political science malor; ls actively 
trying to find out "what's up 
there." An authorized field in-
vestigator for the Aerial 
Phenomena Research 
Organization (APRO), Garis has 
for the last four and a half years 
been involved in an official 
capacity with APRO in checking 
out calls - about 1000 a year in San 
Diego County - relating to aerial 
phenomena. 

"I'm one of four active in-
vestigators in the area," said 
Garis. " Of all the calls we get a 
year, perhaps 30 warrant an in-
vestigation. The other reports are 
often sightings of Venus, weather 
balloons, and things of the like. 
Fairly recently an excited 82 year 
old lady called to report a UFO 

hovering over her house. She 
described it, saying she could read 
writing on its side, Then she read 
the letters. G-O~D-Y -E-A-R." 

Garis has had a lifetime interest 
in UFOs, and became involved 
with APRO, a worldwide 
organization, through an 
astronomy department club at San 
Diego State University. Presently 
he spends five hours a week 
working with the San Diego group 
"when nothing's going on," and 
"every spare moment when things 
are happening." 

Last month UFOs? 
Recently, "things were hal>" 

peoing," according to Garis. Last 
month, in various sections of San 
Diego County, 17 witnesses 
reported UFOs on the same day. 
"We got descriptions from all the 
people, including some respectable 
witnesses as a medical doctor and 
a pilot. They said a triangular 
shaped object with three lights 
hovered and made no sound. Lie 
detector analyses were taken, 

Two Officers are Sans-Candidates 

conclusively proving the object 
seen was not a military aircraft." 

Garis himself says he's "not 
sure" about UFOs, but adds, 'I 
know there is something." "There 
are those objects sighted which are 
not figments of the imagination or 
misidentifications," said Garis. 
"Sightings indicate objects not 
within our technology, in fact, 
completely beyond our present 
capabilities. Having never seen a 
UFO myself, that shadow of a 
doubt remains, but the facts speak 
for themselves, and I've ex-
perienced some pretty hard 
evidence. " 

What Garis termed as " the most 
spectacular cas'e in San Diego 
County" occurred in Lemon Grove 
in 1973. Saying simply "we feel 
there was a landing," Garis went 
on to describe a case that had a 
" wide variety of physical 
evidence," something 'rare in 
aerial phenomena research.

Assistant Chancellor 
Is in South Africa 
David Ryer is Part of Team Studying 
Black Students Exchange Possibility 

by Mark Stadler 
Managing Editor 

Assistant Chancellor David Ryer is in South Africa as part of a team 
organized by the United States government to study the possibility of 
bringing black students from that country to study in American 
universities, the UCSD public relations officer confirmP.d Monday. 

Paul West said Ryer is part of a three-member team which left for 
South Africa three weeks ago and is set to return to America April 25. 
West said he does not know which governmental organization is spon-
soring the trip, although he speculated that it is the State Department. 

However, he emphasized the trip has nothing to do with UCSD. 
" Educational Man" 

West said Ryer told him before leaving that he (Ryer) was made part of 
the team as " the educational man," who will write the team's report. 
Ryer said he became a member both because he has written several 
similar reports and because he knows one of the other members, West 
added. 

West said he does not know who 
the other team members are, but 
said he believes one member is a 
former American ambassador to 
South Africa. 

The news of Ryer's trip has 
brought sharp reaction from at 
least one quarter of the UCSD 
corrununity. Anthony Gonzales, of 
UCSD's chapter of the National 
Student Coalition Against Racism 
SCAR), said Ryer's participation 

in the expedition is "a slap in the 
face of the UCSD community, 
especially black students." 

"Ryer using public funds, is 
doing this work which complies 
with the South African govern-
ment's 'racist policies," Gonzales 
said. "You know, in that country, 
whites are given free education, 
while blacks must pay." 

Gonzales was referring to the 
governmental structure of South 
Africa, where a white minority 
rules the black majority. 

Referendum Re ults 
Gonzales also made reference to 

the results of one question on last 
quarter's student referendum, on 
which students voted, 1281-865, that

AS Panel Eyes 
Formal Grade 
Appeal Process 

by Laura Richter 
Staff Writer 

The Academic Senate (AS) has 
formed an ad hoc committee on the 
problem of grade appeal at UCSD, 
which remains the only UC cam us 
without a formalized system. 

Jeff Leifer, AS student intern, 
viewed the action taken during the 
last week of Winter quarter as a 
response to difficulties that UCSD 
had encountered from its lack of 
official process by which a student 
may challenge the legitimacy of a 
grade he has received. Leifer said 
that students are being "denied 
due process' and that Department 
of Health, Education and Welfare 
(HEW) regulations are being 
violated. 

Candidates Set for First Elections Since 71 
"We're not afraid of HEW," 

Leifer said, "but we're going to 
make them happy or else they'll 
withhold funds ." Also being con-
sidered added Leifer, is the need 
for a " recognized system" which 
will be legitimate in the eyes of the 
court for those students who 
pursue legal action. UCSD students will get an 

opportunity next week to show 
their support for the new 
Associated Students govern-
ment they elected four weeks 
ago. 

The candidates for the 
various ASUCSD offices have 
submitted their applications

" I think this is a crucial issue," 

said Joseph Gusfield, chairman of 
the AS Committee on Educational 
Policy. Commenting that he was 
" skeptical of turning the 
mechanism into a state of constant 
pressure and litigation," Gusfield 
felt that the issue " needs a great

has " found no evidence of 
widespread di crimination of fair 
grading" but added that "there's

Solar Energy Comes to sJ State 
by Clifford A. Welch 

(CPS) - At California State 
University - San Jose (SJSU ), 
dormitory administrator William 
Schooler simply got fed up with 
paying high utility rates. 

Schooler turned to Dr. Donald 
Aitken, head of the six-montb-old 
SJSU Center for Solar Energy 
Application, for help. They came 
up with a pioneering plan to install 
solar water heating units in three 
SJSU residence halls. To save 
money and provide practical ex-
perience to students, they would 
c reate a solar workshop. 

Under the guidance of Aitken 
and grad student Jim Altman, who 
supervises the construction staff of 
15 undergraduates, solar energy 
units have been built and installed 
on each building. In June, when the 
program, dubbed " Project Sun-
shower ," is completed, 600 
students will be using hot water 
heated without cost by the 
magnification of the sun's rays, 
Altman said . 

Altman , an env ironmental 
s tudies graduate student, believes 
the SJSU project is the largest 
s tudent-built solar waterÂ·heating 
development ever. It is budgeted at 
a surprisingly low $125,000, as 
compared to a similar project 
developed by contractors for a 
Georgia school system at a cost of 
$1 million. 

It seems SJSU wants to be the 
trendÂ·setter in practical use of 
solar power. For instance, 
university officials have ear-
marked $600,000 to construct a 
solar heating and cooling plant for 
the new, $11 million library project 
at SJSU. Aitken is working on this 
building as a technical consultant 
to the architects. 

Project Sunshower itself looks 
like the prototype for much greater 
use of solar power in the California 
State University system. Aitken 

hopes a successful Sunshower 
demonstration will encourage the 
University to use solar methods to 
heat many of the system's 
buildings. 

University officials, who ap-
proved the Sunshower proposal of 
Schooler and Aitken last summer, 
have already taken the bait. 
Beyond agreeing to finance the 
library 's solar energy plant, the 
officials may extend the current 

plan to include another three 
dormitories and a 12-story 
residence hall at San Jose belore 
expanding the project to other 
campuses. 

The current project is budgeted 
for ,125,000, said Altman, but in 11 
years that much will have been 
saved. By 1997, Schooler said the 
project " will have paid for itself 
twicp over ," in saved utility bills. 

SCAR Protests Apartheid 
by Mark Friedman 

Student Coalition .Against Racism 

Students throughout the US are organizing a new movement to prevent 
another " Vietnam" in Africa , particularly South Africa. The struggle 
against apa rtheid and racism in South Africa has been growing. There 
are only 4.2 million whites in South Africa, who forcibly inhabit 87 percent 
of the land, while 90 million blacks are denied basic buman and civil 
rights. 

The Student Coalition Against Racism (SCAR) is the main organizer, 
nationally, of activities protesting apartheid in South Africa and in 
defense of Black Students. SCAR is a nationwide organization of several 
thousand students who, as part of an international campaign to get the US 
out of Southern Africa, toured Tsietsi Mashinini, the central leader of the 
June 16, 1976 Soweto demonstrations against apartheid. Mashinini spoke 
to nearly 1,000 enthusiastic people on March 22 at SDSU and City College. 
He said, " We need you to help us get the US out of South Africa." And that 
is what SCAR is doing. 

On March 26, more than 100 people demonstrated at the San Diego 
Federal Building to end apartheid and get the US out of South Africa. 
Among its many sponsors were : James N. Kerry, chairman, SDSU Afro-
American Studies Department; Katye Anderson, chalrwoman, Mesa 
College Black Studies Department; Larry carlin, City College Black 
Student Union ; Earl Davis, Editor, Voice aDd Vlewpolot News. 

San Diego SCAR has !llanned an ambitious program of anti-apartheld 
activities this Spring. Our next activity is a picket line protesting the 
presence of the " whites only" South African tennis team in Newport 
Beach Saturday, April 16 at 12 noon (rides are available). Also, SCAR will 
help launch a drive against the wave of deportations of undocumented 
residents by the lnunigration and Naturalization Service (INS) which 
has recently been stepped up by Carter's new INS director. 

SCAR has members or chapters on all the college campuses and many 
high schools in San Diego. Anyone interested in fighting rac.ism is en-
couraged to join with us. Call us at 452-9318 or write : SCAR, P .O. Box 381,

Election Statements 
Dan Almour 

Informative Gov't Needed 
My name is Dan Almour and I am running for ASU~D President. I am 

a Fourth College Junior, with a major in political science. 
I have been at UCSD for three years, and have worked at EDNA, the 

Student Center Information desk, for two years. I am currently working 
on the Student Center Board, trying to make the Student Center more 
responsive to student needs and desires. I feel that in the two years that I 
have been working at EDNA, I have become aware about almost every 
facet of UCSD's operations. I talk with people, both students and adÂ· 
ministrators, who run UCSD. I know who to talk with to get things done. 

I feel that there are a few things in the college that need to be changed. 
Programming is one area that needs to be looked at closely. This quarter, 
the Campus Program Board is no longer running their Saturday nigbt 
films. I would like to see Saturday night films again. There is a complaint 
that there is too little programming on this campus, and that what little 
we have overlaps or duplicates other programming. I think we need to 
centralize all programming so that we can have increased diversity of 
events, and that aU scheduled events do not fall on the same nj~t. 

Everyone ought to know that their fees are going up next quarter. While 
I feel that the rise might be necessary, I think the government ought to 
look at why the fees went up, and how to cut costs to prevent a future 
increase. 

The campus media poses a problem. People need to be aware of the 
fWlctions and operations of UCSD, and how it affects their lives. Ideally, 
we ought to have a daily newspaper. We also need to have greater emÂ· 
phasL" on those publications which relate to some of the different factions 
on this campus. Heel thatKSDT needs to be operative. 

As well as these issues , I feel that ASUCSD government ought to inÂ· 
vestigate the operations of the Bookstore, food services, and any other 
student service organizations, as well as the co-ops, especially the Bike 
Shop. 

I feel that my biggest asset for being the ASUCSD President is that I am 
una ttached from any faction or interest group on this campus. I am not 
running a slate of candidates as I feel a slate would conswne too much 
power. I feel that working at EDNA for two years that I know what 
students at UCSD want. My chief opponent in this election, Andy 
Schneider, does not, and cannot have the amount of student input than I 
can get by working at the Student Center. 

In his opening campaign letter in the Triton Times (March 18, 1977) 
Andy said he would run for President. In a letter to the student 
Cooperative, in which he held a high position, he included other phrases 
which he omitted'in the TT letter. They said, in effect, that no matter 
what model of government won the referendum, he would work for that 
model. He is a self-acclaimed opportunist. I do not believe that a person 
who would shift loyalties like this can run an effective government. I 
would at al1 times attempt to serve the collective will of UCSD students. 

In conclusion, I would say that I would work as hard as I possibly could 
to make the new government responsive to the students of UCSD. A new 
leader for a new government. 

Andy Schneider 

Students Must Get Involved 
1 cOlild use this space just to talk abQut myseH, but what I want most to 

do is talk about you and us at U~D ... 
Among other things an election is a political exercise and a collective 

expression. Over the break I spent some needed time with a friend We 
were off sailing. He was all ears and I was all talk. 

From here to Catalina, I thought out loud about the responsibilities of 
working in student government and about making another personal 
heavy energy commibnent. I explored the vast potentials for the new AS 
and considered the chances of winning a vote. 

After a couple of beers my friend responded by pointing out, 'if you win 
you've gathered support for implementing a "perspective. If you lose, 
you've helped someone else gather support for a different approach. 

'But either way, UCSD will be on the road to building the community 
you're always talking about and student government will have found its 
purpose. You must have used the word community twelve times, what do 
you mean by it?' 

If you put in a big stack all the research materials, student reports and 
news editorials left over from the student government projects I have 
been involved with over the last year at UCSD, they would have two 
significant messages a bout the community: 

~pen participation for all students in the decision-making process of 
student government. 

-Respect for individual student integrity and for the collective success 
for equally shared effort. 

I alone have accomplished nothing. Together we have shared ideas and 
value systems which have coalesced to create an improved community. 
We have begun to learn the political skills that will give Impact to our 
perspectives. We have begun to learn the research skllls to develop 0p-
tions which challenge past notions of the role of student participation. 

Needs have been identified in the areas of academic affairs, conunittee 
representation, state funding for instructional Improvement, the COOl-
pletion of the cluster college campuses, student control of student 
fees ... The Associated Student Government will be resplmSible for 
facilitating a broad base of student input and ability to meet these student 
needs. 

Through equal participation, Andy as a person has developed a skilled 
knowledge about the purpose and the operation of student government. 

I'm willing to continue to give my thoughts and effort, but I will not teU 
a s tudent government what to do. You've got to be the one to teU AS what 
to do and help accompli h that goal. U the AS is to provide UCSD with a 
se nse of community, its success will rely on wide involvement and not one 
person. 

The real challenge in this 'new Beginning' for the Associated Students 
will be to turn a percentage vote into effective advocacy and 8 
representation which seelu to find student response . Give a littie of 
yourself and the Associated Students can give life to new dreams ... 

I can work to communicate, we can work toaffed a cbaaae, but You've 
gotlo meet the Associated Students baIIÂ·way with your lDvolvemeat. ..

Liberation Letter Was "Refreshing" 
Thanks Artie Lombard for 

writing, and thanks Triton Times 
for printing, Friday's article of 
Human Liberation. It was a 
refreshing departure from .the 
usual treatment of sexism and 
highlighted a very important point. 

Sexual roles limit men as much 
as they limit women. In addition 
the column brought up a very 
important question; despite the 
obvious inconsistency of sexist 
va lues, they persist. Artie Lom-
bard did not understand why . 

My own answer is that our whole 
concept of human worth supports a 
sexist, as well as racist, a 
nationalist and in every way a 
bigoted ideology. 

Our society values many things, 
such as strength in men, com-
pliance in women, blond bair, 
white skin and US citizenship and 
background. Somehow it considers 
people who have such qualities to 
be not merely possessors of 
socially valuable traits but better 
people. Thus if the rules of the 
game change, the successful sexist 
or racist loses not only a little bit of 
social status, he loses his worth as 
a human being . 

Now, a society that valued frizzy 
brown hair, diminutive height, and 
a sharp tongue might make my life 
a whole lot easier. But I doubt 
sincerely if it could make some 
intrinsic change in me as a person. 
How then could it increase my 
worth as a human being? 

Obviously it could not. 

- For while social values are 
relative, subjective, human worth 
is not. You are what you are and 
are worth what you're worth 
regardless of social context. 

There is no objective standard on 
which to measure or compare the 
worth of human beings. Therefore 
there can be no hierarchy of 
personal worth. No one need feel 
inferior, nor has the right to feel 
superior , to another human being. 

Knowing this, the racist, the 
sexist, the bigot of any persuasion, 
can examine his values on the 
basis of the utilitarian benefits 
they bring him. He has no 
psychological vested interest in 
their maintenance. The Human 
Liberation that Lombard ad-
vocates becomes possible. 

There are many other political , 
sociological and economic answers

Tabankln Is working as special 
assistant to Brown on domestic 
affairs and spoke from her tem-
porary office at ACTION 
headquarters. 

The barely furnished room, filled 
only with brown leather cbalrs, a 
desk and a conference table, faded 
into the background as Tabankin 
raced between the outer office and 
the phone in a race with a 3 pm 
confinnation procedure deadline 

by the Civil Service Commlsslon. 
On a blackboard near the window, 
"People Power!" was scrawled in 
capital letters, a slogan whlc:h 
might rlgbtly sum up Tabankln's 
career so far.

Tabankin's past bas all the 

trappings of an FBI picnic ... a short 
stint in SDS at college, a trip to 
North Vietnam (paid for perÂ· 
sonally as the fitst woman 
president of NSA) and fOWider of 
the Martin Luther King ScholarÂ· 
ship Fund at the University of 
Wisconsin where sbe attended 
school from 1966-a. 

The most outstanding feature of 
Tabankln's experience has been 
her commitment to community 
organizing, a commitment sharÂ· 
pened whUe working for organizer 
Saul Alinsky in 1970 as a subsidized 
fellow at the Alinsky Training

procedural error form. Forinerly, 
Leifer said "the professor was 
forced to lie. All he could do was 
turn in a clerical error form if he 
did, in fact, change the grade. 

" We can't afford a barrage of 
students," warned Leifer. "The 
student has to outline his problem. 
He can't I'Wl in every time he gets a 
B and wants an A." Saying that 
"it's their committeeÂ·it's for the 
students," be stressed the need for 
students to comprehend the 
seriousness of the matter. It was 
Gusfield's feeling that "you have to 
protect the process from students 
who simply don't like the grade 
they got." 

ProfellOr Espertise Recopbed 
Leifer explained that the fooCo 

tion of the new process will 
recognize the "professor expertise 
concept, where nobody can tell a 
professor the grade he should 
assign to a student. AD the comÂ· 
mittee can do is decide whether the 
grade was arbitrarily or fairly 
given." 

Gusfield felt that "we have to 
have safeguards in grading fairÂ· 
ness." When asked about possible 
forms of grade appeal procedures 
that might be implemented, he 
said he knew of "a variety of 
systems being used by univerÂ· 
sities, and 1 don't know how they're 
working out." Gusfield later stated 
"I am not endorsing any particular 
procedure." Leifer said that the 
fonnation of the-committee was "a 
great gain for students."

Chancellor McElroy could not be 
reached for comment on Ryer's 
trip, as he is in Dbahran, Saudi

education at the University of 
Petroleum and Minerals there. 

His talk, according to his ad-
ministrative assistant Mary Ann 
Herbenar, is being sponsored by 
ARAMCO, the Arab-American 
Corporate Oil Conglomerate. 

Leifer viewed the development 
of the process as â¢ 'very low key and 
informal, just a formal 
mechanism," that will guard 
against "arbitrary and capricious 
action." He said that it will "give 
the students a feeling that they are 
active participants in the system 
rather than people who have rules 
imposed upon them with no 
recourse." Without the ASUCSD

Punk- It's 
Still Not Pop 

Klaatu?? Mu I Mystery Lure Runt's In Ancient Egypt: RAI RAI 

by Ted Burke 
sta" writer 

The Idlot-Iggy Pop (RCA) 
Being from Detroit, I've some 

natural sympathy for Iggy Pop, a 
fellow Motor City exile. Detroit is 
a ~y, cramped, dying industrial 
town brimming with violence, 
physical and psychic, and the rock 
and roll spawned in that utilitarian 
environment was a reflection of the 
everyday experience. 

Some bands, like the MC-S and 
the Up, tried to parlay their 
frustrations into politics by for-
ming the White Panther, a short 
lived aggregate of greasers gone 
hippie who preached bloody 
revolution with electric guitars. ' 
Others, like the Ambouy Dukes 
(featuring Ted Nugent) were into 
violence for its own sake, and sang 
about guns, chaotic catharsis and 
liberating patricide. Still others, 
like Bob Seger, kept their cool and 
kept on rocking. Iggy, with the 
Stooges, his former band, was a 
lost cause from the start. 

Like so many street comer 
creeps I've seen who had boiled 
their brains with acid, speed and 
glue and had become so numb to 

. functional emotionality that the 
only thing they could understand, 
literally was a sock in the jaw, Iggy 
was a rocker who's music spoke of 
a betrayed innocence. He was the 
all American kid who's been so 
rebuffed by the unconcious 
cruelties of modern life that he had 
to delve to the bottom of the social 
ladder to secure a measure of self 
definition. 

Iggy didn't care how he got his 
kicks, it seemed, and sought to 
show it in conceri. stories of how 
he 'd belly dive on broken glass, 
tear his skin with drum sticks, or 
pick fights with bikers during the 
course of a performance abounded 
in the rock underground, some of 
which I saw in late '69. TheStooges 
three albums, The Stooges, 
Funhouse and Raw Power, carried 
this self-destructive attitude fully, 
conjoined by music that was 
suitably rough, self-involved and 
nervously unstable . 

199y was the surrogate saint of 
s leaze , expressing nihilist 
obliteration fantasies the audience 
itself dared not reveal. Interest in 
him was less aesthetic than 
directly vicarious. The on-lookers, 
caught up in a Roman circus 

Continued on Page 1% 

In an unpreced~ted ' music industry coup, a 
Providence, Rhode Island newspaper "editorial 
assistant" triggered a s~ries of record sales spurts 
and intense radio progranuning across the 
country. Steve Smith, a rock columnist for the 
Providence Journal drew some strong conclusions 
about an unknown "mystery" group OIl Capitol 
Records called Klaatu. 

Quietly released in August, 1976, the self-tiUed 
debut album for Klaatu garnered only moderate 
initial sales response . Purchased by Capitol as a 
completed master recording, the LP has at all 
times been cloaked in an air of secrecy. In fact, 
Capitol has promoted the album solely on its 
fllusic merit since no one employed by Capitol is 
aware of the identities of the members of Kiaatu. 
Manager Frank Davies has been the only liaison 
between Captiol and the band. 

However, upon the initial mailing for review 
purposes, the album garnered remarkable and 
highly favorable critical response. Many critics 
pointed out the similarities to other groups. The 
Walrus (a radio programming guide) exclaimed, 
"Klaatu completely absorbs George Martin, The 
Beatles and Pink Floyd resulting in a Sgt. Pep-
perish record." Others, like Toronto's Cheap 
Thrills Magazine stated, "Klaatu represents a 
new plateau in the development of the phonograph 
record as an art." 

At that point (around the beginning of the year) 
Steve Smith of Providence caught wind of tile 
various Klaatu LP reviews swirling around the US 
and Canada that made allusions to the Beatles' 
style of production and arrangement. The en-
terprIsing reporter begain to investigate the LP 
and Klaatu's credentials. Smith researched the 
origin of the group's name, traced the subtle 
meanings of the lyrics and, if that were not 
enough, the young Providence newspaper Dnan 
even checked out the background of Frank Davies, 
the manager of Klaat.u. 

While Smith did conclude that Klaatu referred to 
a space visitor from a 1951 sci-fi movie, "The Day 
The Earth Stood Still," and found that Davies was 
an employee of EMI from 1~7, he could only 
make abstract projections as to the identity of 
Klaatu . 

In February, The Providence Journal published 
the fruits of Smith's labor in piece entitled, " Could 
Klaatu be Beaties? Mystery is a Magical Mystery 
Tour." In it Smith raised many questions, and, 
following his own research, decided that Klaatu 
more than likely was either in part or in whole The 
Beatles. 

It was with the publication of that article that 
the Klaatu snowball began to roll. The local FM 
rock station in Providence, WBRU-FM, began to 
play cuts from the LP. According to prosram 
director Glenn Stewart, interest in Klaatu was like 
nothing else the station had ever experienced. 
" We played the record with very heayy rotation. 
The phones went crazy for a week for Klaatu." 
Then the local Top 40 station, WGNG, ran a " Is 
This The Beaties?" weekend promotion featuring 
Beatles material Interspersed with news stories 
and bits of Klaatu album. Again , the phone 
response was unusually high. 

But soon, demand for the Kiaatu release 
skyrocketed. Retail outlets were inundated with 
unexpected demand for the record. Record stores 
soon ra n out of their regular supply and an ad-

Todd Rundgren is one . of those 
fortunate individuals who can do 
jus t about anything he damn well

include singing, songwri~ng and

reputation as a sound engineer and

gren also has that endearing 
quality of being a chameleon in the 
rock and roll jungle, changing his 
colors whenever it suited him. 

Rundgren, though, has done with 
Utopia what Paul McCartney has 
hoped to do with Wings : form a 
band that will equally share the 
responsibilities of composing and 
performing. Maybe it gets too hot 
under the spotlight. 

The late '60s saw Rundgren 
coming oft as a roaring faggot, 
replete with multi-colored rainbow

group. The last transition made the 
difference. The new beass player 
(Kasim Sulton) was a singer too, so 
we could do vocals together. I don't 
have to sing all the leads anymore. 
I was still doing most of the singing 
on the last tour. Now we're 
rebalancing the material for the 
new Utopia show. We're a four-
man band now - I think it will last 
and last." Coming from a man who

Last week's Utopia concert

dazzled the Civic Theater audience 
and even managed to impress 
some of them with the music,

props.

Klaatu identify themselves?" Davies lets it suffice 
to say that clues to the group's identity exist on the

These clues , according to Davies, include morse

Women Netters Lose 
In Evenly Matched Play 

by Judy W.ltoa 
SIaffWrHer 

DeSpite a 7-2 defeat for the UCSD 
women's teMis team against Cal 
State Dominguez Hilla last Friday, 
appearances SUUested that the 
two teams were evenly matched. 

Stroog playing by the Tritons 
despite gusty winds kept the games 
close, with most matches going 
into three sets to determine a 
winner. The match was not a 
league match for either team. 

Pam Gold, playing number two 
singles, and 8ebe Cabrero, number 
five singles, handed the Tritons 
their only two points of the match. 
Both players faced tough o~ 
ponents from Dominguez Hills, 
but managed to edge them out in 
tne third set, 7-5 for Gold and 6-4 for 
Cabrero. 

Paul Metsch III and John Gerdsen [r1 display their backhands in recent men's tennis action . The Tritons 
finished a disappointing 5th place in the AIIÂ·Cal tournament. 

Debbie Shapiro, number one 
singles player for the Tritons, lost 
to Lee Dunstedter in the third set, 
6-3. Both women looked almost 
evenly matched, with strong 
strokes and good footwork on both 
sides. According to Shapiro, "We 
are aU playing one position highe{ 
up on the ladder today, because our 
number one girl didn't show up. 
Nonnally, I'd face an opponentÂ« 
probably slightly lower calibre."

UCSD finished fifth in the six 
team, three day round-robin 
competition, scoring 14 points. 
Berkeley, meanwhile, totaled 41, 
edging out Irvine with 39 for the 
team title . UCSB took third place 
iwth 21 points, followed by Davis 
with 17, UCSD and uCSanta Cruz 
brought up the rear with 2. 

Coach Tad Yamaguchi expected 
his squad to finish as high as third 
place, but some close matches and 
tough daily pairings prevented his 
expectations from materializing. 

On Friday, the Tritons met 
UCSB, losing 6-3. Against the 
Gauchos, UCSD won only one 
singles match (Yamaguchi hoped 
for 3 singles wins) and 2 of 3 
doubles matches. Yamaguchi 
thought if the Tritons could win this 
match, third place was within 
reach. That afternoon, Berkeley 
blanked UCSD, 9~. 

Saturday'S matches saw UCSD 
battle Davis for a possible fourth 
place finish, but the Tritons fell, 6-
3. Several of the singles matches 
went the full three sets. Irvine shut 
out UeSD, 9-0, later in the day. 

Against Santa Cruz on Sunday 
morning, UCSD won handily,8-l. 

Yamaguchi cited the play of Jon 
Gerdsen, a junior from Orinda; 
freshman Paul Metsch from 
Riverside Poly HS (where he was 
randed 24th in the SoCal junior 
play ) and Bill Hein as outstanding 
for the tournament. The trio 
showed good strength and they 
suffered close loses against Davis 
and Santa Barbara. 

All thi-ee doubles teams suffered 
losses to Dominguez Hills, which 
was somewhat disappointing. 
Dana Wooster and Linda 
Schlesinger looked the most 
hopeful in the first set, with a close 
7-5 defeat. But the ~cond set 
clinched the victory for 
Dominguez Hills, 6-2. 

According to Peggy Eurman, 
number six singles player, "It was 
a fun match, well-played. Despite 
the final score (6-1,6-2), each game 
in itself was very close. They've 
got a very good team." UCSD is 
looking forward to playing another 
match against Cal State 
Dominguez Hills in the near future, 
since the players seemed so evenly 
matched. Dominguez HiDs came in 
second in their league play. Their 
season is already over. 

UCSD lost the first six games of 
league play, but won the next three 
straight in an unbroken winning 
streak. Explained Triton coach 
Chris Mattson, "The first six 
teams we faced were the hardest 
competitors in the league. Now 
we're facing teams that should be 
easier to beat." 

Mattson added that, "This is 
probably our last year of league 
play, because next year the junior 
colleges will have their own 
league. I know we'll do our best in 
the remaining time we have ."

One thing that is not lacking on 
the UCSD women's tennis team is 
enthusiasm. "Most people," said 
player Pam Gold, "think we are 
just a pretty spectacle to watch -
women tryiDg to play temis. What 

Sue Brennan 
they don't realize is that we are

in sixth in All Cal competition

the world checked out a story 
which involved two boys (ages 14 
and 13) spotting an object in an 
open field 

"They thought it was a water-
stack," said Garis, "that is wrtil 
they approached the object and it 
began to hum. A circle of red and 
white lights went on around the rim 
of the craft. Then it rose up on 
three podlike projections, and 
soared away." 

Consequent investigationa 
proved that: 

-three podlike impressions were 
found in the grolDld that had to 
have been made by an object of at 
least 800 pounds. 

-the boys, subjected to a battery 
of tests, came out 100 percent. 

-in the surrounding neigh-
borhoods (for three blocks), it was 
found that television and radio 
interference was extemely bUnae. 

-animals in the area were quite . 
disturbed. 

-a telephone wire was \mocked 
down-during the time the craft 
was believ.ed to have been there. 

SightiDgl Withheld NaUoawtde? 
Garis believes that such a lan-

ding, though unusual, is not unique, 
stating openly that, "I believe 
nationwide things are withheld" 
Noting that "the government 
probably withholds things not to 
create a panic," Garis cited the 
case of Congressman Gerald Ford 
who wrote to the House and Ser-
vices Committee asking that all 
UFO infonnation be released, and 
then as President, Ford did not 
follow through with his earlier 
suggestion. . 

"Though the United States 
tlovernment is hush bush about 
infonnatlon, other countries are 
not," said Garis. " We know that

our country has sent up aircraft 
against UFOs, and lost some, but 
there haven't really been any of-
ficially reported. Last year in 
Tehran, Iran, two Phantom jets 
were sent up after an object, at-
tempted to fire, and could not. 
Neither could they close on the 
object, although they were 
breaking the sound bamer. 
Additionally, there was radar 
confirmation and visual sighting 
by two control tower observors. 
The story made the front page of 
the national newspaper." 

Garis cited "unusual" cases 
which have occurred in the US, 
Including the Betty and Barney 
Hill case (where the two were 
allegedly brought aboard a 
spaceship), and the conaequences 
which resulted from it-namely, 
the founding Â« a new, confirmed 
star system, Beta Reticu1i, which it 
is believed Betty Hill described 
explicitly under hypnosis (and was 
later scientifically "found"). 

Additionally, Garis described 
one American Airlines pilot who 
was so shook up upon seeing a UFO 
that he wasonthevergeofquitting, 
and another pilot who called in a 
Mayday upon seeing what he 
tenned "something the size of a 
747" crash in~ the sea near the San 
OnÂ«re nuclear plant. Even more 
startling, Garis claims that every 
one of our space flights has had 
UFO sightings, with photos taken 
by the astrona uta. 

Noting the " incredible interest" 
in UFOs, Garis guest lectures 
around the county. He said on ooe 
KDEO talk show he stayed on for 
three and one half hours as o~ 
posed to the schedu)ed hour, with 
people at the station "literally

Hoax Pictures 
Naturally, with such a nation-

wide interest, and perhaps spurred 
on by the National Inquirer's offer 
of a million dollars for " proof" of 
UFOs, APRO comes upon many 
"hoaxes" every year. "We have 
experts who can sift out the trick 
photographs," said Garis, noting 
however that "some of the fakes 
are excellent." One San Diego 
"fake" was particularly good, with 
the photographer using a strobe 
light and spending what Garis 
believes must have been "hun-
dreds of hours" in getting "one 
flasher per stroke" image over the 
San Diego skyline. 

" Objects have been seen 
though," said Garis. " There have 
been UFO sightings all during the 
history of man. My personal 
feeling is that they can either be 
one of two things: a natural 
phenomena not known to our 
scientists, or spacen-aft controlled 
by an intelligent force of some 
type. The intelligent forms could 
either be extraterrestrial, or using 
Einstein's theory, future earth 
people come back to look at us ." 

Garis stresses APRO's scientific 
" outlook," and urges anyone who 
sights something unusual to give 
them a call at their 24 hour line 
(714-292-7207 ). "We're out to find 
the truth," he said. "We know 
respectable people are often 
harrassed for speaking out on their 
sightings, but the '?DIy way 
scientific data can be brought out 
is through people bringing 
sightings to our attention. Reports 
can be kept highly confidential." 

In the meantime Garis hopes 
that he too might one day be a 
" lucky person" who spots 
"something in the sky."

HERE'S ONE ENGINEERING OPPORTUNI. Y' 
YOU WON'T GET IN PRIVATE INDUS. RY. 

If you're thinking about a 
career in engineering, think 
about this. 

How many companies can 
offer you a nuclear submarine 
to operate? The answer is 
none. Equipment like this is 
available only in one place ... 
the Navy. 

The Navy operates over 
half the nuclear reactors 
in America. So our training is 
the broadest and most com-
prehensive. We start by 
giving you a year of advanced 

engin~ring technology. In 
graduate school, this would 
cost you thousands, but in 

the Navy, we pay you. 
Once you're commissioned 

as a Nuclear Propulsion 
Officer, you'll earn a top 
salary. Over $24,000 a year 
after four years. And you'll be 
responsible for the most 
advanced equipment 
developed by man. All the 
Navy asks in return is that 
you serve for 3 years on active 
duty upon completion of your 
training. 

You have only lmtil May 
15th to enroll in this year's 
Navy Nuclear Propulsion 
Candidate Program. If you 
are majoring in engineering, 
math or phY1ical sciences, 

NAVY OFFICER. 

contact your placement office 
to find out when a Navy 
recruiter will be on campus. 
Or call toll free, 800-841-8000 
(in Georgia, 800-342-5855) 
for more information. And if 
you're still a junior, ask about 
the Navy's NUPOC Collegi-
ate Program, which pays you 
up to $6,000 during your 
semoryear.

to nuclear training, no 
one can give you the same

inarticulate rage, psychetic self

199y appealing in the first place-
his Wlabashed exhibitionism,

muted to the degree oflnvisibility. 
Bowie has attempted to make him

University & Industry Relationship: 
Sweethearts Or Vital Partners? 

by Hugb MclDtOllb 
Staff Correlpoadeat 

To some legislators here the 
term " university research" 
conjures up visions of Franken-
stein-like scientists in fuming 
laboratories who secretly create 
mutan-life fonns out of DNA and 
build laser powered death rays, all 
on taxpayers' money. 

To others, university research is 
a sweetheart relationship between 
professors and industrialists in 
which the fonner can ignore their 
tedious students while inventing 
exciting new labor saving profit-
making machines for the latter, all 
on taxpayers' money. 

This week, UC officials will try to 
exorcise these visions during state 
budget hearings of an University 
request for 56 million dollars of the 
taxpayers' money for research. 
Except for an inDation allowance, 
the University is asking for the 
same amount it received this year. 

" There is certainly no secrecy 
about the kind of research we do," 
said UC Academic Vice-president 
Donald Swain. The research 
project and the results are all open 
to the public . 

Yet it is difficult to find out how 
much money goes to each project. 
Swain said budget requests are not 
broken down on a project-by-
project basis because of the con-
tinously changing research 
p~iorities of the Universtiy. 

New flexibility 
" We need this flexibility to do 

what (reasearch) we think is 
needed," he said. 

James Kendrick, UC Vice-
president of Agricultural Sciences, 
denied ther e is a sweetheart 
r e lationship between the 

University and industry. He said 
that essentially, the University 
does not do any research for in-
dustry with non-industry money. 

"People feel the University is a 
clinic for the agriculture in-
dustry," said Kendrick, wboIe 
department receives about half of 
the research money. "They think 
we sit here and wait for some 
problem to be identified (by in-
dustry), and then jump in." 

Kendrick said that agricultural 
problems are usually identified 
when fanners or people from the 
more than 50 UC agricultural 
extensions notify his department of 
them. The problems are in-
vestigated, and experiments might 
be conducted, he said. 

The mechanical tomato har-
vester introduced in 1964 is often 
pointed to as an example of the 
allegedly free research performed 
by the University for the 
agriculture industry . 

The idea for the harvester 
originated with some agricultural 
engineers at the University, 
Kendrick said. They were simply 
looking for ways to relieve the ' 
drudgery of farm labor, so they 
decided to develop a tomato 
picking machine. 

Kendrick said the University did 
not view the development of the 
harvester as a way to help the 
agriculture industy de.al with the 
unionization of farm workers, as 
had been charged. 

Saxon Explains Research 
UC President David Saxon ex-

plained University research in a 
much broader context. In a recent 
speech, Saxon said the University 
and society have a relationship 
throuhg research that is supportive 
and beneficial to both of them. 

"What our universities have is a 
partnership in the unending search 
for the better understanding of our 
universe and the greater will being 
of its inhabitanta," he said. 

There is a ready market for 
applied research because it 
provides a solution to an im-
mediate problem. It is profitable 
and therefore performed 
throughout society, especially in 
industry, he said. ' 

Basic research, on the other 
hand, seeks knowledge for the sake 
of understanding. It is not, in the 
short nul, a profit making business 
for the industry, he said. 

"The actual fact is that basic 
research ultimately turns out to be 
not only profitable, but crucial to 
our progress," Saxon said. 
Universities have been established 
by society to seek new knowledge 
even if its discovery serves no 
practical purpose. 

" Basic research provides the 
raw materials on which applied 
research and technology must 
draw. Without these new 
materials, society's problem-
s\)lving abilities would soon be 
limited to better applications d. 
existing knowledge. 

" Although basic research is 
necessary for the advancement of 
applied research, the converse is 
also true, " added Saxon. 
Technological development has 
been indispensable to the search 
for new knowledge. 

" It seems to me that the 
message foir both the University 
and the broader society is clear," 
Saxon stated. "We need each other 
if we are to broaden our un-
derstanding and to look for 
solutions to our problems."
