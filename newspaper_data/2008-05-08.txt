At its meeting last week, the A.S. 
Council heard from its Task Force 
on Referenda about the necessity 
of the fee referendum that UCSD 
undergraduates voted on in last 
quarter’s election survey.

The revenue from an increase 
in student fees would help bolster 
campuswide events such as the Sun 
God Festival as well as funding for 
student organizations.

While next year’s council will 
make the final decision on whether 
there should be a referendum, this 
year’s councilmembers informally 
recommended a quarterly student 
activity fee increase of $9.60. This 
amount falls within the category

Nearly 100 people suspected of 
involvement in a recently exposed 
drug ring at San Diego State University 
were arrested this week, ending a 
months-long undercover sting opera-
tion that revealed a network of illicit 
substance distribution and purchase 
within and around the campus.

individuals suspected of having pur-
chased drugs from members within 
the drug operation. 

Authorities also confirmed that 
one suspect, Omar Castaneda, 
36, is a documented gang mem-
ber who may have connections to 
Mexican drug cartels. Officials said 
Castaneda may have received his 
supply of cocaine from Mexico and 
members of the cartel.

Campus police, along with 
the Federal Drug Enforcement

on campus in May 2007. The death 

Officials said a total of 96 people 
have been arrested in connection 
with the case, 75 of whom are stu-

confiscating up to $100,000 worth 
of cocaine, marijuana, Ecstasy and 
illicit prescription drugs. A number 
of weapons — including a shotgun 
and three semiautomatic pistols — 
and $60,000 in cash were also seized 
as evidence, authorities said.

“This operation shows how 
accessible and pervasive illegal 
drugs continue to be on our college 
campuses, and how common it is for 
students to be selling to other stu-
dents,” San Diego County District 
Attorney Bonnie M. Dumanis said

UC Berkeley Student 
Stabbed to Death

Berkeley homicide detectives 
are investigating the death of a UC 
Berkeley senior who was stabbed 
in the chest last week in front of 
the Chi Omega sorority house a 
few blocks from the Cal campus. 

Police officers responded to 
reports of someone brandishing 
a knife and found the victim, 21-
year-old Christopher Wootton, 
surrounded by a crowd of about 
20 people.

According to police, Wootton 
was transported to a hospital, 
where he was pronounced dead 
early Saturday morning. Andrew 
Thomas Hoeft-Edenfield, a 20-
year-old Berkeley City College 
student, was arrested on suspi-
cion of the homicide and is being 
held without bail. 

Sigma Pi Chapter Director 
Mark Hanna in a statement that 
Wootton was a Sigma Pi fraternity 
member and a nuclear engineer-
ing student set to graduate at 
the top of his class. Wootton had 
recently been offered full schol-
arships to the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology and UC 
Santa Barbara.

“There were a lot of students 
around at the time of the incident 
and many of them [had] been 
drinking,” Sgt. Mary Kusmiss 
said in a statement. “It’s a couple 
weeks before graduation so it’s 
been very celebratory over here. 
There were a couple of verbal dis-
putes prior to the stabbing which 
became deadly.”

The victim’s brother, Joshua 
Wootton said, he belives his broth-

er was trying to stop the fight and 
keep the peace.

Scientists Use Nanotech 
‘Worms’ to Target Tumors

Researchers at UCSD, UC Santa 
Barbara and the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology have devel-
oped nanometer-sized “nano-
worms” that move through the 
bloodstream with little interference 
from the body’s immune defense 
system and lock on to tumors. 

The nanoworms will be able to 
detect developing tumors that are 
too small to locate by convention-
al methods. Composed of mag-
netic iron and oxide and coated 
with a polymer, the microscopic 
vehicles carry payloads targeted 
to specific features of tumors and 
could more effectively transport 
toxic anticancer drugs in high 
concentrations without damaging 
other parts of the body. 

“Most nanoparticles are rec-
ognized by the body’s protec-
tive mechanism, which capture 
and remove them from the blood-
stream within a few minutes,” 
Michael Sailor, a UCSD chemistry 
and biochemistry professor who 
headed the research team, said 
in a statement. “The reason these 
worms work so well is due to a 
combination of their shape and 
to a polymer coating on their sur-
faces that allows the nanoworms 
to evade these natural elimination 
processes. As a result, our nano-
worms can circulate in the body of 
a mouse for many hours.”

The scientists’ discovery is 
published in this week’s issue of 
the journal Advanced Materials.

A news article published on May 5 titled 
“Budget Deficit a Hot Topic at State Capitol” 
incorrectly stated that the California State 
University system employs about 445,000 fac-
ulty members. In fact, the CSU employs about

chosen by the most students who 
indicated support for a quarterly fee 
increase on the election survey, task 
force member and Vice President of 
Finance and Resources Sarah Chang 
said in an e-mail.

The voting process will most likely 
take place during Fall Quarter if next 
year’s student representatives approve 
the referendum with a special elec-
tion to determine whether the student 
body supports raising quarterly fees 
in exchange for the continued growth 
and funding of campus activities and 
groups.

If the new A.S. Council moves to 
host a special election, the majority 
of the money will go to the Sun God 
Festival and student organization pro-
gramming, as these were the top two 
priorities as indicated by the survey 
on the election ballot, VP of Finance 
and Resources-elect and task force 
member Naasir Lakhani said.

While there is no plan to cut fund-
ing for these types of campus events, 
Lakhani said that without increased 
funding to compensate for the growing 
cost of upholding such programs, A.S. 
programmers will struggle to main-
tain the current quality of events.

“With the rising costs of put-
ting on concerts and festivals, the 
programming office would likely 
be unable to reach the caliber of 
events that they have had in the 
past,” Lakhani said.

A.S. President-elect and task force 
member Donna Bean agreed that the 
quality of future events is dependent 
on the referendum.

Talk of Ice Rinks, Petting Zoos
Dominates Final Council Meeting 

UCSD’s pressing need to combine petting zoos and ice skating rinks came to a head last night 
as this year’s A.S. Council convened 
for its final meeting and considered a 
number of superfluous proposals.

The nonsensical bills — includ-
ing one to dissolve Sixth College and 
another to use $100,000 for a movie 
remake starring A.S. councilmembers 
— belied the seriousness of many of the 
issues that the council grappled with 
throughout its term in office.

Early in the academic year, council-
members had a rough encounter with 
a funding bill that perhaps should have 
been left in the 
realm of loony pro-
posals. The coun-
cil’s first substan-
tive debate erupted 
at its third meeting 
after $2,100 worth 
of sexually sug-
gestive “shocker” 
foam fingers were 
delivered to the A.S.-sponsored Triton 
Tide spirit crew.

In the ensuing months, council 
members became entangled in ques-
tions about using student fees to fund 
organizations and events that are spe-
cific to just one college, and how to 
best amend its constitution in light of 
the implementation of instant runoff 
voting. Most recently it hotly debated 
the construction of the RIMAC Annex 
because it contained decidedly nonath-
letic elements.

Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Penny Rue made quarterly visits to 
the council covering a variety of topics, 
including the potential fallout of cuts 
to state funding and the need to build 
new campus traditions. Rue and the 
council also found themselves at odds 
over the scheduling of alcohol-dispens-
ing Bear Gardens during class time and 
the necessity of spending thousands of 

additional dollars to beef up security at 
the Sun God Festival.

A perennial issue at this year’s 
meetings was UCSD’s strained parking 
resources, which the council met with 
a desire to promote sustainability and 
a forthcoming regional transit pass that 
will give students free access to public 
transportation throughout San Diego.

Among the issues that council-
memebers will pass on to their suc-
cessors next week are improving the 
relationship with the local La Jolla 
community and bolstering the mental 
health services available to students. 

Both issues led to tense moments 
over the course of 
the year. Associate 
Vice President of 
Local Affairs Aida 
Kuzucan nearly 
broke down at a 
council meeting 
in January while 
she recounted the 
zero turnout of her 

fellow councilmembers at a La Jolla 
Christmas parade after she spearhead-
ed UCSD’s participation in the event.

Arts and Humanities Senator 
Samantha Peterson spoke out later 
that month during one of Rue’s visits 
about her difficulties in finding ade-
quate mental-health resources when 
she was going through a difficult period 
in her life. Rue, who had just finished 
explaining that UCSD’s mental-health 
system was not critically flawed, agreed 
to discuss the matter privately.

Last night wasn’t a night for serious-
ness, though. As many councilmem-
bers prepare to hang up their A.S. polo 
shirts for good, new blood is waiting to 
pick up where they leave off.

The petting zoo/ice rink had its 
15 minutes of fame, but union nego-
tiations, campus diversity concerns and 
rising tuition costs are sure to make 
their respective returns.

pen, there will be a tangible backlash 
in the quality and quantity of pro-
gramming and funding available to 
the student body,” she said.

While students involved in on-
campus organizations are likely to 
support higher quarterly fees, the task 
force members are unsure of what the 
general student body is willing to pay 
for the events that their fees support. 

“I suspect the students that are 
involved in organizations across cam-

pus will support it, because they know 
what it means for them and how hard 
it is to please groups with a limited 
amount of funds,” Chang said. “But I 
also know that fees are always increas-
ing and that our wallets can’t take 
much more.”

According to Lakhani, the election 
survey counted more students for than 
against raising fees, but he said that 
due to low voter turnout, he would not 
cite the results as a perfect representa-
tion of campuswide student opinion.

“The results of the survey indi-

cated that approximately 1,100 stu-
dents were in favor of some sort of 
fee increase, while approximately 
800 students were opposed,” he said. 
“However, I am a little skeptical of 
these results because I am unsure of 
whether the 1,900 students that voted 
in the election represent a true ran-
dom sample of the student body.”

The task force committee has also 
strongly recommended to the council 
that any referendum include a four-
year moratorium on further referenda, 
which will ensure that students only 
face a referenda once in their UCSD 
careers. 

“This would help avoid the situ-
ation students have had to deal with 
concerning the athletics, P.U.L.S.E., 
and possible A.S. referendum within a 
span of two years,” Bean said.

Between inflation, which has 
essentially descreased the value of 
student fees in real dollars, and ris-
ing costs such as additional security 
for Sun God, quarterly fees are no 
longer enough to financially support 
the events that students enjoy with-
out more funding, task force member 
and All-Campus Senator Utsav Gupta 
said.

Bean added that while a morato-
rium would allow UCSD students to 
forget about referenda for a few years, 
the overall funding outlook does not 
look good.

“Unless the California government 
decides to invest more in education, 
fees across the board will continue to 
rise,” she said.

Crescenzo at sdecresc@ucsd.edu.

and generates over $14 billion for 
California’s economy. With more than 
13,000 students, the UC system also 
operates the nation’s largest health sci-
ence and medical training programs.   

“The educational quality of the

ognized,” UC Executive Vice President 
of Business Operations Katherine N. 
Lapp said in a statement. “But the

active presence in communities beyond

based examples of how their work 
benefits the state. 

“In San Diego, there will be 
advertising on the local NPR affiliate 
and on the Union-Tribune web site,” 
UC Executive Director of Strategic 
Communications Brad Hayward said 
in an e-mail. “We have a multimedia 
Web page that will reach out to people 
across the UC community, including 
at UCSD. And we’re going to be build-
ing out the effort in new ways in the 
months ahead.”

The campaign costs $700,000, an 
amount that will help the university 
reach a wider audience in its effort to 
inform the public of its many services 
to California.  

“We believe public institutions have 
a responsibility to tell the public about 
what they are doing for the people who 
support them with their tax dollars,” 
Hayward said. “UC has a great story 
to tell — our faculty, staff and students 
have a huge impact on the economy, 
health and quality of life of this state 
— and we want the public to be aware 
of those contributions.”

The UC system provides health care 
for over three million patients a year, 

reviewed accounts payable, stu-
dent accounting and other payroll-
related transactions in an attempt 
to verify that tax information was 
properly reported to the federal 
government.

IRS spokesman Raphael Tulino 
said the agency does not com-
ment on active audits, but Marvin 
Friedlander, the chief of the IRS 
branch that oversees colleges and 
universities, told the San Diego 
Union-Tribune when the audit 
began that the agency only audits 
public universities when it believes 
that business income or employ-
ment taxes are not being properly 
reported.

According to university spokes-
woman Stacie A. Spector, the uni-
versity is providing the IRS with 
information relating to a few dozen 
payments made in 2005, after which 
the agency will present UCSD with 
a final report of its findings and 
give the university an opportunity 
to comment on or correct anything 
that it believes to be inaccurate or 
incomplete. 

While the audit has so far found 
that UCSD has been properly report-
ing tax calculations and remittances 
on compensation, Spector said that 

for the 2005 and 2006 tax years, the 
university will likely be required to 
pay additional fees for cell-phone 
costs incurred by UCSD.

“In looking at various benefits 
provided to employees, and the poten-
tial for taxable transactions, the IRS 
has indicated that the UC policy on 

accountability for use of cell phones 
does not fully comply with regulatory 
requirements for documentation,” 
Spector said in an e-mail.

Although there is legislation 
currently pending in Congress to 
reduce documentation require-
ments for cell phones, Spector said 
it is unlikely that the IRS will apply 

“The UC policy on accountability for use of cell phones does not fully comply with regulatory 
requirements.”

UCSD spokeswoman

those changes retroactively to the 
tax years currently under examina-
tion.

The last time UCSD under went 
an investigation by the IRS was 
about 10 years ago as part of a 
UC-wide audit of “unrelated busi-
ness income,” which is generated 
by activities deemed by the agency 
as unrelated to the academic mis-
sions of colleges and universities, 
including travel tours, intellectual 
property and advertising revenue 
generated from sports events and 
television shows. 

Friedlander added that that 
complaints from businesses have 
led the agency to increasingly focus 
on the UBI of colleges and univer-
sities, although the current audit 
of UCSD does not fall under that 
category.

“We’ve had complaints from some 
businesses that felt there is unfair 
competition with universities, in the 
area of travel tours and the produc-
tion of TV shows and movies,” he 
said. “Some businesses felt that there 
was not a level playing field.”

Spector said the audit would 
most likely be finished by June.

“An important responsibility of 
any public institution is fostering

we seek to do with this new project,” 
Lapp said. “We hope it will begin to

of a second student on campus, 
also from a cocaine overdose, in 
February 2008 prompted authorities 
to step up their efforts. 

“This investigation spotlights 
two tragedies,” DEA Special Agent

a statement. “The tragic drug over-

and secondly, the shattered futures 
of those students who choose to 
continue to engage in the illicit sale

The investigation targeted seven 
campus fraternities and led to the

Theta Chi and Phi Kappa Psi fra-
ternities. Officials said that, in some 
fraternities, nearly all of the mem-

Throughout the investigation, 
authorities conducted over 130 sep-

cocaine from fraternity members 
over the course of the investiga-

ber of the Theta Chi fraternity, sent 
a mass text message to a group 
he referred to as his “faithful cus-
tomers,” informing them he and 
his associates would be unable to 
sell cocaine for a weekend while in 

Las Vegas. He also wrote that they 
would be having a “sale” on cocaine 
and listed the reduced prices in the 
message.

The investigation saw a total 
of nine search warrants issued for 
houses and apartments on and 
around the campus, including the 
Theta Chi fraternity house.

Students arrested in the raid have 
been suspended and those resid-

ing in university-managed housing 
have been evicted, campus officials 
said. None of those arrested will 
be allowed to attend classes or take 
final exams until all necessary legal 
proceedings have been completed. 

In addition, campus officials 
announced Tuesday that six fra-
ternities — Phi Kappa Psi, Theta 
Chi, Lambda Chi Alpha, Phi Kappa 
Theta, Sigma Alpha Epsilon and 
Sigma Alpha Mu — have been sus-
pended until further investigation 
into their involvement with the drug 
ring is completed. 

SDSU President Stephen L. Weber, 
who requested DEA assistance in the 
case upon learning of the scale of the 
drug ring early in the investigation, 
commended the efforts of investiga-
tors in a statement Tuesday and said 
that the bust reveals a larger national 
narcotics problem.

“Certainly today’s arrests under-
score the scope of the challenges 
universities face as we fight this 
major societal problem,” Weber 
said. “We are determined to remove 
people from our community who 
have placed our students at risk, and 
to see that they are turned over to 
the criminal justice system. Today’s 
arrests are a big step forward toward 
a safer environment for our stu-
dents, faculty, staff and neighbors.”

that a drug operation of the mag-
nitude witnessed at SDSU might 
exist at UCSD, any indication of 
such activity could produce a simi-

enforcement agencies.

“It would be naive to think that 
drug violations are not occurring 
on our campus, but we haven’t wit-
nessed anything that would indicate 
an operation of the scale at SDSU,” 
King said. “In order to conduct an 

[investigation] like that, you have to 
have information or intelligence that 
indicates that something like that is 
occurring. If we had information that 
led us to believe that activity like that 
was occurring on campus, then we 
would consider that kind of action 
and possibly with the involvement of 
an outside agency.”

The link between mind and 
body is weakening, according to 
mental health experts around the 
nation. A meeting of mental health 
professionals this week produced a 
loud call for mental-health reform 
in institutions of higher education. 
It marked the first time that the 
American Psychiatric Association 
presented such in-depth discussion 
about how colleges and universities 
deal with issues of mental health 
and public safety.

Specifically, the 100 conference 
participants discussed issues of sub-
stance abuse, suicide, privacy laws 
and campus violence, highlighting 
the inefficiency of overwhelmed and 
underfunded campus mental-health 
facilities as well as current policies 
from campuses around the nation 
that push troubled students away. The 
most alarming trend is the slow dete-
rioration of resources for vital cam-
pus services such as mental health, 
while the demand for such services is 
unfortunately not shrinking.

The University of California is ail-
ing from the nationwide problem, as 
is UCSD. With the state’s gloomy fis-
cal picture, priorities will be stretched 
across an expansive set of services, 
and mental health services are already 
taking a hit. At UC Davis, university 
administrators proposed a 7-percent 
budget cut to their funding to campus 
services, according to the California 
Aggie. The student government at 
Davis responded, arguing through 
a unanimously approved resolution 
that the drastic cuts, which would 
impact both professional counseling 
services and student organizations 
that provide counseling, would dam-
age the university’s mental health 
resources. 

At UCSD, Vice Chancellor of 
Student Life Penny Rue has priori-
tized mental health. She rightly con-
nects the vague element of campus 
climate to issues of mental health, an 
equally complicated but more insti-
tutionalized issue. Rue has seen the 
creation of several Wellness Centers 
on campus, which this year have 
provided students with a crucial 

Nationwide economic alarm has bled into high-er education, producing 
grim predictions its future health: 
Degrees will continue to cost more 
as the assurance of them attract-
ing employers shrinks. According 
to this season’s latest national Job 
Outlook report, the damage will 
be concentrated within certain 
fields, but no less disabling.

UCSD’s recent Life Sciences 
Career Expo was an accurate 
picture of the biotech industry. 
Job-hungry students hunted Price 
Center’s floors for the juiciest 
opportunities — and there were 
plenty. The job fair ran the local 
gamut of biotech companies, 
from major institutions to spe-
cialized niche companies, with 
available tastes for every pos-
sible variety of biologist, chemist 
and biochemist. The Job Outlook 
report found that the overall 8-
percent increase in job opportu-
nities from companies specifi-
cally seeking to employ new col-
lege graduates was focused within 
the science sector. The report’s 
authors added that job availabil-

ity in many other careers, such as 
finance, would be hit hardest by 
the economic slump.

No matter how robust the bio-
tech industry becomes, the sever-
ity of recent economic troubles 
spells disaster for other job fields 
that are faltering. As a whole, 
students are disenchanted with 
the worth of their education. A 
recent national survey conducted 
by California State University 
Monterey Bay’s Panetta Institute 
found that two-thirds of students 
are worried about being able to 
find a good job while 85 percent 
view the economy’s health as “not 
so good or poor.”

The most potent cure offered 
by experts is realism: “The impor-
tant thing is to keep an open 
mind and be flexible — it’s your 
first job, but it’s not going to be 
your only job,” said Mimi Collins 
of the National Association of 
Colleges and Employers. It’s an 
astute but misdirected diagno-
sis: How far can you climb the 
ladder if you start at the very 
bottom? The disparity between 
careers’ attractiveness is widen-

ing because “administrative assis-
tant” is accounting’s entry-level 
position while the biotech indus-
try hires its new graduates into 
higher-paying jobs with more 
potential for advancement.

The health of the job mar-
ket shapes U.S. higher educa-
tion — how it functions, what it 
offers and the kinds of students 
it enrolls. But the relationship is 
also mutual. Institutions of high-

er education can nudge the job 
market by developing its weak-
er areas. Constant cultivation 
of careers in nonscience fields, 
through career-specific job fairs, 
scholarships and grants, will 
make them more lucrative to stu-
dents. Demand for employees in 
such fields must parallel a rise in 
interested employees before the 
health of job availability in non-
science sectors is rejuvenated.

In his first conference interview with college newspaper editors, incoming UC President Mark 
G. Yudof voiced worry about the 
state of student loans. The industry 
that was embroiled in nationally 
recognized scandals of mismanage-
ment and misdirection is apparently 
still reeling. 

As college degrees become 
must-haves in an ever-increasingly 
competitive job market and tuition 
levels across the nation continue 
to rise, the end result is more 
broke students. A recent editorial 
on Insidehighered.com drew a scary 
comparison: What if this year’s 
housing market crash happened to 
the loan industry?

The logic isn’t far-fetched. Like 
in the housing market, students 
are more likely to default on larger 
loans. As a result, private lenders 
are shying away from the market, 
leaving a big burden on federally 
subsidized loan sources. More than 
50 lenders opted out of the massive 
Federal Family Education Loan pro-
gram, finding that federal support 
was dwindling along with profits.

With the industry reaching what 
politicians consider a near-crisis 

stage, federal agencies have rightly 
stepped in to nip disaster in the 
bud. U.S. Education Department 
Secretary Margaret Spellings 
announced to state agencies that 
they could soon be enlisted to 
administer a “lender of last resort.” 
The program has been in the works 
for months as a deterrent to the 
industry’s troubling trajectory, and 
offers aid to students who aren’t able 
to obtain federally guaranteed loans 
from private lenders. 

Congress is offering proper atten-
tion to the problem, recently passing 
legislation that extends Spellings’ 
power to purchase loans from pri-
vate lenders to manually revitalize 
the loans market. President George 
W. Bush is also lining up behind 
the legislation and is expected to 
approve it. 

Meanwhile, Sallie Mae is enjoy-
ing stable profitability. A Wall Street 
research firm published a report of 
the legislation’s impact on the larg-
est student-loan company in the 
nation, finding that the bill would 
even further develop the company’s 
share of the loans market as lesser 
competitors continue to retreat from 
the wavering industry. This board 

would want moves in Washington 
that flood the market with different 
types of loans at different levels of 
interest.

But politicians are at least posi-
tioning themselves to get their arms 
around the fattening problem. Once 
Washington can shore up the gap-
ing problems within the student-
loan industry, politicians will be 
able to move toward more longer-
term solutions to give accessibility 
to higher education the shot in the 
arm that it needs.

How to Get Good Money From Science, Without the Learning
Jobs are overrated. I mean, unless you’re an engineering student 

who gets a bomb-ass paid 
internship or a bartender (seriously, 
if you are, Facebook me — let’s hang 
out), it’s kind of hard to get a well-
paying job as a college student.

Sure, I have friends working 
part-time in labs and retail, and 
friends who spend a few hours a 
week tutoring middle schoolers, but 
between juggling classes and extra-
curriculars (ahem, Guardian) and 
maintaining a social life, it would be 
nearly impossible for me to squeeze 
in a job during the small amount of 
free time that I have left available. It’s 
just not worth it to kill myself over 
some extra pocket change because 
the added stress of throwing a job 
into the mix would most likely send 

look around campus.
You read correctly. UCSD is 

filled to the brim with opportuni-

ties to make money with little or no 
effort required on your part. More 
frequently than you might expect, 

my life into an unstoppable down-
ward spiral.

I know, I know. There are people 
currently reading this column who 
are definitely thinking, “F--- you, 
man. You don’t know what’s it’s like 
to have to work to put yourself 
through school. My daddy isn’t pay-
ing for college like yours is.”

And I say to you all: “Pshaw.”
I do know what’s like to put 

myself through college, because I 
pay for every single expense myself. 
Although I am lucky enough to 
receive grants and Stafford Loans, 
oftentimes with sizeable refunds 
that provide me with a comfortable 
cushion that among paying for rent, 
food and books occasionally allows 
me to be a baller at the bar for a 
night, when I need easy money I just 

your answer for cash is just a mere 
phone call or e-mail away, and you 
don’t even need to look hard to find 
layer upon layer of enticing income-
boosting imagery.

Yup, look at the walls. Next 
time you’re traipsing through Price 
Center on your way to grab a $5 
foot-long (quite possibly the best 
deal ever) or wait in an abnormally 
long line to chow down on a bite of 
decrepit orange chicken (seriously, 
the gnarled, glazed chunks look 
like aborted fetuses — and WTF is 
“Beijing beef ”?), take a glance at the 
columns in the dining area.

They’re loaded with flyers adver-
tising none other than research 
studies — and they pay bank. As stu-
dents at a research university, we’re 
lucky to be constantly bombarded See WORD, page 5

Loan Industry Problems Could Engulf  Students

variety of holistic health services. 
At one of her first public meet-
ings with the entire A.S. Council, 
Rue characterized UCSD’s mental 
health as more related to anxiety 
than depression, based on meet-
ings with the campus’ mental 
health officials. This is an essential 
separation that needs to be consid-
ered when constructing a solution 
to campus mental health woes. 

Cases of depression need long-
term services 
that would man-
date the employ-
ment of  more 
p r o f e s s i o n a l s 
who could treat 
patients for 
longer periods. 
Cases of anxiety, 
however, would 
require profes-
sionals who are 
available for the 
sudden, abrupt 
kind of situa-
tions that pro-
duce intense 
anxiety.

Rue approaches mental health 
with a nicely calculated style. She’s 
both identified the character of 
UCSD’s mental health and how 
to treat it. Unfortunately, students 
at other campuses have found 
administrators less understand-
ing. At the APA meeting, attend-
ees said that students are afraid 
to report mental-health problems 
for fear of being forced from cam-
pus during mental health crises 
by “mandatory-leave policies.” 
APA officials said that the policy 
strands needy students without a 
support system and permanently 
harm self-esteem.

Speakers also addressed the 

gap between student and adminis-
trator interests in the area of men-
tal health, saying that on-campus 
suicides tend to tarnish the uni-
versity’s reputation a lot more than 
deaths that take place at home or 
on breaks, leading universities to 
maintain mandatory-leave poli-
cies even though they are harmful 
to students. UCSD maintains no 
such policy, offering a number of 
post-suicide services to help stu-
dents cope.

During the 
d i s c u s s i o n , 
the group also 
stressed the 
i m p o r t a n c e 
of increased 
peer interac-
tion among 
i n d i v i d u a l s 
— especially 
graduate stu-
dents, who face 
a higher sui-
cide risk than 
u n d e r g r a du -
ates — sharing 
similar mental-

health issues to create a viable, 
tightly knit support system.

With funds waning, a fully 
developed system of mental health 
services will most likely find slowly 
paced university and state support. 
It is wholly possible to see students 
forced to pay for better mental 
health services. But it may be the 
best investment that students can 
make — after all, what pays more 
than good mental health?

court. Next time you walk past one 
of those giant concrete slabs sticking 
out of the ground (the ones that let 
you know you’re in “Sixth College” on 
the way to class), look at the flyers a 
little more carefully. Beyond the event 
announcements and creepy offers 
to allegedly earn lots of money for 
the simple act of mailing envelopes 
(c’mon, if that was actually legit, every-
one would be doing it) lies a treasure 
trove of research-study advertisements 
flashing money signs right in your 
face. Check out the San Diego Weekly 
Reader for even more sweet deals.

Since freshman year, I’ve enrolled 
in numerous studies, raking in hun-

dreds upon hundreds of dollars in 
cold hard cash during the process. 
Complete a quick survey and give up 
a dozen or so drops of blood from a 
finger for $75? Count me in. Paste 
weirdly cool nodes to your head and 
take an easy computer test for $20 
during that that two-hour break you 
have between classes? Obviously a 
yes — plus, you get to see what your 
brain waves look like, which is pretty 
cool even without the cash supple-
ment.

I’ve even earned $200 by acting 
as a guinea pig in an experimental 
acne-drug study (not to mention my 
skin improved), and just this week 
I completed the first leg of a study 

that will send me home with another 
$200 just for lying in a hospital bed 
for a few hours with an IV in my arm 
while a nurse takes some harmless 
blood samples. A friend of mine even 
got $400 for stopping smoking weed 
for a month and giving up a few brain 
scans. (I didn’t qualify because I was 
over the age limit, but seriously, how 
could you pass something like that 
up?)

So go, people. Screw that job and 
start taking advantage of the bevy of 
wallet-fattening research-study oppor-
tunities oozing from every campus 
nook. You’ll thank me when you final-
ly get a hold of that fatty check. And if 
not, I’ll happily enroll in your place.

THURSDAY, MAY 8, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN HIATUS  9

Words White People Like
(When They Go to the Cinerama!) 
M ovies are predicated on words. Images too, yes, but words make film. They create the blueprint, sell it and spread the message. So 
it’s with great chagrin to look at the movie establish-
ment (and the public) and their ill-chosen words. 
Words that, when removed from their original cin-
ematic meaning, convey something different, some-
thing wrong, something dumb.

Some context: a while back, I recommended 
“Rushmore” to a friend’s brother, a fan of “I Heart 
Huckabees,” saying, “You might enjoy it — it’s got a 
similar vibe.” To which he replied, “Oh, they’re both 
indie style?” Despite a strong urge to explode into a 
tapestry of obscenities, I resigned, “Yes, indie,” and 
left him to fawn over “High School Musical.”

Hearing that bitter word “indie” over and over 
again, I started thinking about movie-going words 
that get disconnected somewhere between meaning 
and intent. Those that we, as an audience, reck-
lessly wield as if their usage will give the film purpose. 
Hundreds of overused terms clutter my mind, but 
here are the big four, the most wanted. Let’s get this 
hate train rolling:

Indie — When did the abbreviated slang for 
independently funded filmmaking become the 
phrase for a full-on cinematic style? The easy blame: 
Wes Anderson, director of 
“Rushmore.” His vibrant color 
schemes, geometric production 
designs, camera trickery and 
refined music selections have all 
but defined the “hip” style of the 
decade. This is not to argue that 
he set out to accomplish this, 
rather, the result is an unintend-
ed byproduct of his work.

Go back far enough, and you’ll see where Anderson 
gets it: Mostly from the films of Hal Ashby, an oft-for-
gotten filmmaker from the 1970s who made some of 
the decade’s most powerful pictures, notably “Harold 
and Maude,” whose look and feel is appropriated 
by Anderson into his modern fare. And so, began 
a feel fashioned out of the cult status of “Harold 
and Maude,” tooled into a viable visual scheme by 
“Rushmore,” commercialized by “Garden State,” and 
finally inducted into the mainstream by “Juno.” I’m 
not trying to denigrate any of these flicks — in fact, I 
happen to like most of them — but it’s the ridiculous 
faction of film enthusiasts who blindly equate method 
to means. I’m assuming they wouldn’t count “Boys 
Don’t Cry,” a Sundance favorite, as “indie.” Nor would 
they insist Gus Van Sant’s “Last Days” is in the same 
“style,” because it’s not (warning: meaningless stock 
phrases ahead) sweet, or offbeat, or the most heinous 
of them all ...

Quirky — The be all, end all of words that give 
absolutely no resonance to the subject they’re 
ascribed. You hear this one a lot as “a hilarious, 
quirky comedy.” What does it even mean? The Oxford 
English dictionary limits “quirk” to either a “peculiar 
behavioral habits,” a “strange chance occurrence,” 
or “a sudden twist, turn, or curve.” All that given, 

what makes Juno MacGuff any different from Tony 
Montana in “Scarface”? Sure, little Juno dishes pop-
culture references with the speed of that guy from 
the ’90s Micro Machine ads, but Tony Montana has 
just as many verbal spins — with profanity — to 
also count as a “peculiar behavioral” habit. And he 
fucking kills people! Seems like an awfully “peculiar 
behavioral habit” to me. Juno’s “strange occurrence” 
may be getting knocked up, but how does that top the 
“strange occurrence” of becoming a drug kingpin on a 
virtual whim? Judging by definition alone, “Scarface” 
is as much a quirky comedy (yes, the film is hysteri-
cal) as last year’s critical darling. What, then, makes 
something quirky if the word is used for interesting 
characters and plots? You know, general practices of 
moviemaking?

Gritty — Almost every time you catch a glimpse at 
any new crime-drama, you’ll spot the word “grit” or 
“gritty” machine-gunned across the reviews, posters, 
trailers, you name it. Anything about a gun in a big city 
is now gritty. It’s most shamelessly abused during Oscar 
season, when studios roll out their cops-and-robbers 
shoot ’em ups in hopes of equaling the critical success of 
2006’s “The Departed,” — and that film was one of the 
worst offenders of the word.

The concept of grit and gritty film emerged out 
of the late 1960s and early 1970s 
American New Wave movement, 
when young directors were given 
virtually free reign (and free coke) 
over their pet projects. Directors 
like Martin Scorsese, Arthur Penn 
(“Bonnie and Clyde”) and Dennis 
Hopper (“Easy Rider”) merged 
their lifestyles and interests with 
cinema verite — a stylistic tech-

nique designed to offer a “truer” sense of film, often 
applying documentary filmmaking concepts to fiction. 
Scorsese’s “Mean Streets” from 1973 is probably the best 
example. It was gritty because Scorsese filmed it true to 
how he must have experienced growing up in Little Italy 
— and it wasn’t pretty. Compare Robert De Niro fight-
ing on a pool table to Leo Dicaprio slamming a thug 
through a soda fridge. Scorsese chose to follow De Niro 
with a hand-held camera, as if we’re in the room, while 
offering a smooth tracking shot for Dicaprio — a cool 
number indeed, but it doesn’t put us in closer touch 
with his character. “The Departed” is not street grit, it’s 
Hollywood gloss.

Urban — You’ll often see this one paired with 
“gritty” on movie posters littered throughout theater 
lobbies. But while “The Departed” was hailed as “the 
year’s grittiest crime drama,” it couldn’t get the “urban” 
moniker sewn on. Why? Look at the cast: Dicaprio, 
Jack Nicholson, Matt Damon. You’ve got some white 
folks on the big screen. But take “American Gangster” 
and its cast (Denzel Washington, Common, Ruby Dee), 
and you’ve got yourself “the year’s grittiest urban crime 
drama.” Somewhere in the wake of independent black 
filmmakers, notably Spike Lee and John Singleton (“Boyz

If playwright/director David Mamet had an actor

similarly leapfrogs from style to style, between hard-

HOUSE OF BLUES / MAY 10 / 8 P.M. / $24.50

Oh, what a night! S.D.’s House of Blues hosts a Nylon-curated 
evening of rockers starting with Switches, who come from the Franz 
Ferdinand school of angular post-punk — only these guys bring a 
melodramatic air to their struts. Then the discofied Virgins take 
the stage with their hipster-friendly, faux-British androgynous pop. 
Personal favorites Be Your Own Pet play the night’s wild card act 
with bright-eyed guitar ballast and nostalgic high-school quips 
that appeal to the young soda-fiend in all of us. If you want to brood 
more, stay for goth-pop headliners She Wants Revenge. (CK)

 Lil’ Mama
■ VYP: Voice of the Young People

T here’s a reason we don’t judge artists by their first major singles: Ludacris would’ve been tossed out with his lick-lick-licking 
in “What’s Your Fantasy” and we would have 
impulsively knocked off Lil’ Mama, whose “Lip 
Gloss” is her inaugural single off Voice of the 
Young People that sells this femme firecracker 
short.

That’s not to say “Lip Gloss” wasn’t the best 
gym-room banger in years; it was just awkward 
glorifying a ditty about MAC brushes and boy 
crushes.

But why not consider Lil’ Mama the second 
coming, a brand-new breed of novel hip-hop-
stress that does the bounce-step hotter than 
Missy Elliott, tears down bars on Lil’ Kim’s level 
and reps an age group younger than Rihanna?

Lil’ Mama isn’t flanked by any of those big-
timers on VYP, flying solo on some of the most 
addictively danceable tracks since Chris Brown’s 
Exclusive. “G-Slide” is a rowdy, hopped-up ver-
sion of the infant tune “Wheels on the Bus,” 
horns bring swing-and-sway flavor to “Make it 
Hot,” and “Lip Gloss” is shamefully undeniable 

with its teenage brashness.
By the time Lil’ Mama brings Chris Brown 

and T-Pain for “Shawty Get Loose,” we know the 
album’s score: VYP is the bible of pops and locks, 
the handbook to stomping ‘round the blacktop 
and romping through the streets. In the music 
video, the trio brings the hottest spaceship dance 
battle since Michael and Janet’s “Scream.”

But this ultra-addictive “hip-pop” album gets 
weak beyond its schoolyard-slammers. Some 
even manage to fall terribly flat, including the 
Pain-produced “What it is (Strike a Pose),” a 
mucky mixture of drumlines and anthem cheers. 
Odd pairings wreck other tracks: Lil’ Mama is 
dragged to the depths of pop by Avril Lavigne’s 
“Girlfriend Remix” and gets sickeningly cutesy 
on “Truly in Love” with the Stryder’s Peter Toh.

VYP isn’t the perfect career starter but rings 
an alarm loud enough for all of the industry’s 
females to hear: This Mama can cook up some 
hot shit in her kitchen.

S an Francisco glitch pioneers M.C. Schmidt and Drew Daniel take a turn for the light-hearted with their carnival synth suite 
Supreme Balloon, a heady departure from their 
previous sound documents of surgeon equip-
ment and animal bowel movements. The gay 
partners in techno crime decided to craft an 
all-electronic album, dusting off antique gear 
from the likes of Waldorf and Moog to flesh out 
a fully realized retro Godzilla of tech nuance.

Opener “Rainbow Flag” sways like a lounge 
pianist in an old hotel, but when you walk a bit 
closer you realize the man and piano are actu-
ally made of millions of tiny robotic insects. It’s 
a little disheartening to hear such eerie frequen-
cies alone, but the pulsing sum is surprisingly 
pleasant. In contrast, “Polychords” steams ahead 
with the nostalgia of an aging amusement park 
ride, each analog pad perfectly aligned with the 
locomotive beat.

Occasionally, a grating cell phone ring from 
the early ’90s or an 8-bit death rattle bubbles up 
to the surface, helping to alleviate any monoto-
nous machine fatigue. However, the slipshod 

“Mister Mouth” glitches itself to hell without 
even offering listeners a warm electro chord to 
take the edge off; too much binary riffing can 
wear down your mind.

To lighten the inhuman mood, the duo 
summons a cavalcade of robo-fart tones on 
“Exciter Lamp,” which sound fascinating on a 
pair of quality headphones but never exceed 
joke-novelty status. They follow it up with a 
morsel of baroque composition called “Les 
Folies Francaises,” imitating the electric pomp 
of the “Clockwork Orange” soundtrack. The 
minimal piece segues into Supreme Balloon’s 
monstrous 24-minute title track, which builds 
and builds an aged mini-orchestra on a plain 
progression with the same mild epiphany 
of someone playing Earthbound on Super 
Nintendo for the first time. It doesn’t burst like 
Godspeed’s crescendos do, but Matmos seems 
to be more intrigued with restraint and how 
subtle you can get with circuits.

self-indulgently frivolous, the visual imagery 
plays upon its own theatricality in defiant 
nonchalance. The impressionism that defines 
its creativity almost arrogantly straddles the 
line between film and digital imaging at it 
most climatic, to the point of using the green 
screen as the antidote for its foreseeable limi-
tations. 

Similar to the inspirational impressionism 
found in Japanese wood-block prints, “Speed 
Racer” finds its muse in anime aesthetics. The 
film reinvigorates its own medium by rec-
ognizing and infusing itself with the artistic 
creativity of another.

With camera movements that utilize 
extreme close-ups, lateral panning, flat depth 
perception and an assortment of side pro-
files, the visual style that threads the scenes 

together revels in its unique aestheticism of 
storytelling.

At other times the camera maneuvers fast-
er than any physical camera could to enter 
new spaces not even crane shots could pull 
off. Granted that much of the craftsmanship 
is made possible by green screens and CGI, 
the live-action portrayal of anime’s strictly 
imaginative construction ambitiously explores 
uncharted territory. In the end, it translates 
the magic of animation into the art of film.

For all its bravado, “Speed Racer” nests 
itself as a family comedy, sporting the PG-
rating badge as a welcoming gesture to all 
audiences. A lighthearted ride, what it lacks in 
content it makes up for in style and form and 
yet, a certain level of disappointment pervades 
when the Wachowskis’ previous works man-
aged to blend all three.

n the Hood”), every inner-city tale got pegged as 
an urban drama. Because apparently, only dis-
enfranchised black communities reside in urban 
settings. Even those with a different scope, like 
the aforementioned “Gangster” or Eddie Murphy 
comedy classic “Coming to America,” had urban 
smeared all around. Woody Allen’s “Annie Hall” 
was filmed in New York just like “Coming to 
America.” Why isn’t Allen’s comedy an urban 
flick? Makes you ponder the demographic mar-
keting goals. At least it’s a step up from calling 
them “ghetto” films, which is probably the only 
other word studio moguls batted around before 
settling on the softer alternative.

You’ll notice that all these words happen to 
be adjectives, used to overly describe something. 
Can’t we drop the “quirky” and “indie” and just 
call it a comedy? Or just a crime drama? These, 
along with even trite and cliche phrases like 
“coming-of-age” or “screwball,” are at least hon-
est in their description and don’t bullshit us with 
implications under the definitions. Looking back 
at a number of reviews I’ve written, I’m probably 
guilty of using these four terms multiple times, 
and damn if they don’t detract from what I tried 
to say. They’re easy; language cop-outs for those 
of us who refuse to take time and digest what we 
just saw. This has got to stop. It’s time to pick some 
new words.

C.R.A.C.
■ The Piece Talks
TRES RECORDS

M y main complaint about hip-hop albums in the past few years has always revolved around cohesiveness. Albums tend to sound 
more like a patched-together mix of random, 
incongruent songs than individual pieces of a 
larger project. Still, once in a while someone man-
ages an album that sounds like an album and at the 
same time is smart and creative. Enter C.R.A.C., 
the Cali-based duo made up of Los Angeles’ Blu 
and Detroit-underground veteran Ta’Raach, and 
their debut album, The Piece Talks.

C.R.A.C., pronounced crass not crack, is an 
acronym for Collect Respect Anna Check, which 
quite literally outlines the ideology behind the 
duo’s music and attitude. The record is aggres-
sive without sounding menacing and its clever 
tongue-in-cheek humor (check Raach’s hilarious 
impression of his label boss at the end of “Buy Me 
Lunch”) is reminiscent of the type of fun heard on 
old De La Soul albums.

Lyrically the album is sparse; there are some 
songs that have no rapping or limited bars, but that 
works out fine because the album’s essence doesn’t 

lie in the lyrics. While in some albums the beats 
are designed to be a kind of platform for the artists, 
the music on The Piece Talks is perhaps the most 
interesting and creative element of the record. It 
should also be noted that Ta’Raach handled the 
entirety of the production, though some tracks 
feature live instrumentation. The beats never really 
fall short though the sound’s cohesiveness prevents 
a standout from emerging.

Still, the album’s off-center, aggressive-yet-sar-
castic sound is an enjoyable, calculated mess. 
One minute it sounds like it could almost be on 
the radio and then the next rap on the album is 
a voicemail greeting, then a few songs down Blu’s 
singing like he’s possessed and one of the last 
tracks of the album is Ta’Raach directly insulting 
the people who bought the album. It’s well under 
the radar but that doesn’t stop The Piece Talks 
from being fantastic and one of the better releases 
of the year.

and get to know one another, but it’s 
amazing how quickly they all came 
together.”

Holding a 3-0 lead after doubles, 
UCSD only needed two of the six 
singles matches to secure the win. 
The Tritons didn’t have to wait long to 
secure their spot in the second round. 
Senior Molly Sullens was superb at 
number five singles, annihilating 
Kaitlin Woolridge by a perfect 6-0, 6-0 
score. Tang clinched a UCSD victory 
in the tie with another dominating 

win, defeating Michelle Stock, 6-1, 6-
0. The other four singles matches were 
left unfinished; all matches are halted 
once the result has been decided in 
tournament play.

The win improved UCSD to 
14-10 overall and set up a block-
buster second round matchup with 
Brigham Young University-Hawaii 
in Laie, Hawaii, the eighth straight 
year that LaPlante’s Tritons have 
made it that far in the tournament. 
The Seasiders are the top seed in the 
West Region and are a perfect 25-0 

in the season.
UCSD’s matchup with BYUH in 

a West Regional Semifinal puts the 
Tritons two wins away from a pos-
sible invite to the Division-II National 
Championships. It’s been three years 
since UCSD has made it that far 
nationally. The Tritons are still opti-
mistic, but they know that BYUH is 
a large hurdle that has been tough to 
clear in years past.

in the top of the ninth and UCSD fell 
by a final of 8-4.

The Tritons lost a heartbreaker in 
the series and season finale, scoring 
eight runs in the bottom of the ninth, 
but fell one run short of tying the game 
and ended up losing 17-16. UCSD was 
down 4-2 through three innings before 
scoring in the fourth, fifth and sixth 
innings to take a 7-4 lead.

In the top of the seventh, the Otters 
put up seven runs and after the stretch, 
the Tritons responded with a lone run 
to cut CSUMB’s lead to 11-8. The 
Otters put up three more runs in both 

the eighth and ninth innings, making 
the game seem out of reach when the 
Tritons came to bat in the bottom of 
the ninth down 17-8. But UCSD put 
up eight runs and had the bases loaded 
with two outs, with a chance to pull 
off the walk-off win in the finale. But 
sophomore shortstop Vance Albitz, 
just named to the CCAA’s Second 
Team, grounded out to the pitcher and 
the Otters escaped with the 17-16 win.

Although the Tritons dropped their 
final two games before the postseason, 
the team is still entering the conference 
tournament with confidence.

“If we play our ballgame — if our 

starting pitching throws a few good 
innings, our offense hits the ball and 
we execute and our bullpen shuts it 
down at the end of the game — we 
should be pretty solid,” Shibuya said. 
“We just have to go into each game 
saying ‘we’re going to throw our guy 
out there and we’re going to beat you 
and we’re going to move on to the 
next team.’ As long as we have that as 
our plan and don’t get too far ahead of 
ourselves, I think we’re sitting pretty 
good.”

It is unclear if Phan or Olsen’s scores 
will qualify either golfer for the NCAA 
Division-II National Championships, 
which start on May 20.

Aside from the NCAA champion-
ships, the Tritons are looking forward

THURSDAY, MAY 8, 2008

GOLF — Juniors Nathan Phan and Billy 
Olsen played some of their best golf 
during the regular season’s final run. 
Their play at the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association Championships 
was superb, and they were each given 
individual bids to the NCAA Division 
II Men’s Golf Northwest/West Super 
Regional in which both Tritons finished 
in the Top 25. The 16-team tournament 
comprised of the top eight teams of 
the West and North Regionals gath-
ered at the Adobe Creek Golf Club in 
Petaluma, Calif., for a three-day event 
from May 5 to May 7. Only one team 
will advance to the Division-II Spring 
National Championships Festival in 
Houston on May 14 to May 17.

Phan and Olsen participated in the 
individual tournament that fielded 10 
competitors who were all striving for 
the only spot in the national cham-
pionships. The 10 participants in the 
individual field posted the top scores 
of teams that didn’t qualify for the 
Super Regional. Phan earned his bid by 
posting a 218 at the CCAA cshampion-
ships, which was good for ninth place 
overall. Olsen ended that competition 
at 34th, with a score of 235.

In the first round, Olsen led the way 
by firing a first-round 73 (+1), which 
put him in a tie for 10th. Meanwhile, 
Phan shot an opening round 75 (+3), a 
showing that put him in a tie for 20th. 
Olsen started fast, getting birdies on his 
second, fourth and sixth holes. Three 
bogeys on the front nine had Olsen 
going out with an even 36 and birdies 
on 16 and 17 helped him climb the 
leaderboard and end with 73.

Phan started fast, going out with a 
–1, 35 on the front nine after tallying no 
bogeys and eight pars. However, Phan’s 
strong opening round took a turn for 
the worst on the par-5 11th, where a 
triple-bogey eight set him back several 
strokes.

“That 11th hole was a disaster,” 
Phan said. “I was playing some excel-
lent golf, especially on the front nine, 
and was in a groove. “Eleven proved 
to be an adventure, and really was a 
downer after the terrific start I was able 
to put together.”

Olsen was understandably more 
pleased with his results.

“I really started and ended the round 
well, and it put me in a great position 
heading into the second round,” he 
said.  “My main concern is to keep the 
bogeys down because I know there are 
opportunities out there to get birdies 
and get closer to the leaders.”

However, Olsen abstained from 
thinking too far ahead to finals and 
said he wanted to stay focused.

“There’s a lot of work to do before 
that happens,” he said.

Things took a turn for the worst 
for both golfers in the second round 
as Olsen stumbled to a 77 (+5) that 
dropped him to 24th place overall at 
+6 while Phan shot a second round 76 
(+4) that has him at +7 overall and in 
28th place. Phan endured a rough start 
to his second round, posting a double-
bogey on the opening hole and a bogey 
on number two. He settled down after 
the tough start, and finished his front 
nine with a 40 (+4). Fortunately for 
Phan, he rebounded on the last nine, 
using two birdies to shoot an even 
par on the back nine and finish at 76

TENNIS — The Tritons just completed 
their fifth consecutive undefeated sea-
son in California Collegiate Athletic 
Association play, a streak that now 
stands at 48 straight matches. However, 
in her 29th year with the Tritons, head 
coach Liz LaPlante plays down the 
streak’s magnitude.

“We are proud of that streak, but it’s 
the NCAA postseason play that has the 
most significance,” she said.

With the regular season finished 
and another undefeated conference 
season in the books, the women’s ten-
nis team can now turn its attention to 
bigger and better things. The Tritons 
began their postseason road on May 3 
when they hosted conference rival Cal 
Poly Pomona at home on the North 
Courts.

Even though UCSD dominated the 
Broncos, winning their two meetings 
by a combined score of 17-1, LaPlante 
insisted that everything changes in the 
postseason.

“I make sure to let my girls know 
that no team can be taken lightly since 
anyone can have a great day or a bad 
day,” she said. “[Cal Poly Pomona] has 
some good players with a lot of poten-
tial and since they have nothing to lose, 
they can come in a little more relaxed.”

The Tritons came out strong in the 

first round of the Division-II Tennis 
Championship, continuing their domi-
nation of Cal Poly Pomona with a 
5-0 victory, which was sure to send 
a statement to the Broncos for the 
future and more importantly increase 
UCSD’s momentum coming into its 
next match.

The 23rd-ranked Tritons started 
strong in doubles play against the 
Broncos, winning all three matches 
to gather some early momentum. At 
number one doubles, freshmen Taskeen 
Bains and Natalie Varnay battled hard 

in the first postseason match of their 
careers, holding off Cal Poly’s top duo 
of Jenny Tsai and Jennifer Chow, 8-6. 
Another freshmen pairing of Valerie 
Tang and Kimmie Dao made success-
ful debuts in the Division-II tourna-
ment by beating Fallon Blattner and 
Kara Fisher, 8-3, at the second doubles 
position. The Tritons sent out a veteran 
group at the third doubles spot, with 
senior Justne Ang Fonte and junior Ina 
Dan taking on Kaitlin Woolridge and 
Jessica Winkler. The experienced duo 
jumped on their opponents early, and 

never lifted their feet off the gas, blow-
ing by them 8-0.

LaPlante has relished the talented 
group of freshmen that has come in, 
and she has repeatedly praised their 
skill and contribution to the Tritons’ 
continued success.

“I’ve never had a stronger or more 
talented group of freshmen, and it’s 
been great to see their progress,” she 
said. “Everything was a little challeng-
ing at first just getting everyone to bond

BASEBALL — A series split against 
Cal State Monterey Bay kept the No. 9 
Tritons from capturing the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association’s regular 
season crown, but with a 24-9 confer-
ence record, UCSD will enter the dou-

ble-elimination postseason tournament 
with the second seed in the field of four 
and face No. 11 Chico State today.

The Wildcats earned the tourna-
ment’s third seed following an impres-
sive 24-11 conference record, but 
lost the season series to the Tritons, 
3-4. Although the Tritons won their 
regular season series against both the 
Wildcats and the Cal State Stanislaus 
Warriors, the tournament’s fourth seed, 
they could only pull off a split with 
the CSUMB, one of the CCAA’s cellar 
dwellers.

“It’s always kind of nice to be going 
into the postseason on a high note,” 
freshman pitcher Tim Shibuya said. 

“But we didn’t play our best baseball 
and Monterey definitely deserved to 
win those games. But it’s over now and 
we have other things to focus on and 
right now our only concern is looking 
at Chico.”

UCSD hosted CSUMB for four 
games, with the opener on May 2 a 4-0 
Triton win. Sophomore starter Kirby St. 
John improved to 8-0 with seven strong 
innings and Shibuya, recently named 
the CCAA Freshman of the Year, and 
senior Keith Noe went the last two 
innings to complete the shutout.

On May 3, UCSD split a double-
header with the Otters, dominating 
the first game 11-1 before falling 8-

4 in the nightcap at Triton Baseball 
Field. Freshman Guido Knudson was 
the latest Triton pitcher to stymie the 
Otter bats, as he went eight innings and 
allowed a lone run.

Sophomore Matt Rossman was the 
first UCSD pitcher to get hit hard, as the 
Otter bats finally awakened and tagged 
the righthander for five runs, only three 
of them earned, in 3.2 innings. The 
Tritons fell behind 7-1 after the Otters 
scored two more runs in the top of the 
fifth and started to come back with one 
run in the sixth and two in the seventh. 
But the Otters added an insurance run
