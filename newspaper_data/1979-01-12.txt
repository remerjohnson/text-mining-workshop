Referendum Delayed · 
DeIB, Reg Fee Clash Over Question 
By J eff Beresford-Howe 

Aaocia&e New. Editor 
The Day Care Infonnation 

Board approved wording for 
this quarter's referendum on 
Day Care yesterday, but it 
appears almost certain that the 

• vote, cheduled for January 23, 
will be po tpon d. 

The postponement , the 
second so far, came because 
the DCIB has not completed 
work on the voter infonnation 
phamplet which will be sent out 
to voters prior to the election. 

Kenzie Nichol, Reg Fee 
chair, gave a letter to the DCIB 
yesterday saying that the Reg 
Fee committee was delaying 
the election for four weeks, 
but he later said that the delay 
would probably be only two 
weeks. 

Con.fiicts over wording of the 
referendum questions divided 
the Reg Fee committee and the 
DeIB last quarter, and have 
expanded this quarter to 
include jurisdictional disputes 
between the two bodies. 

have the authority to make that 
decision," adding that though 
the relationship between the 
DCIB and Reg Fee is 
"ambiguous," "it is a principle 
established by the Reg Fee 
committee that we are 
autonomous. " 

Nichol agrees-"We should 
not interfere" -but some Reg 
Fee members are still unhappy 
with the wording. 

.. Reg Fee wanted an 
informal relationship," Third 
College Reg Fee representative 
Martha Mangold says, " but I 
don't think it has worked out at 
all. " Mangold says that the 
wording of the referendum is 
"biased" and deals with issues 
students .. probably won ' t 
understand. " 

Mangold's principle objec-
tions are to the first two 
questions on the DCIB 
proposal, which deal entirely 
with wh at percentage of the 
Reg Fee Budget should go to 
support day care. She argues 
that no information packet 

proposal. 
Mangold also says that the 

referendum is biased in favor of 
day care funding because the 
questions ask for percentage of 
support, not whether it should 
be supported. 

Carberry disagrees, saying 
that students can vote to give 
" 0% " of their Reg Fee monies 
to day care if they choose, and 
says that a well-constructed 
information packet can 
sufficiently educate voters. 

The DCIB will meet this 
afternoon to decide on the 
procedure for getting together 
the infonnation packet. Both 
Nichol and Carberry say that 
the packet has to get out two 
weeks in advance of the 
election to be effective.

DeIB members object to 
Nichol's letter, Board chair 
Ann Carberry saying that "the 
Reg Fee committee doesn't 

uld enlighten the ot rs 
enough to deal with questions of 
Reg Fee expenditures as 
complicated as are in the DelB 

Opinion on what effect the 
referendum will have is 
divided. Nichol says that it is 
strictly an " indicator" for the 
Reg Fee committee, with no 
binding effect on what the 
committee may decide. " It 
would be foolish," Nichol says, 
to be bound by the results of the 
referendum. " 

Mangold goes further, saying

KSDT-Coors Forum on for February 
By Teresa Tokar 

Start Writer 
CSD's KSDT radio station 

will be presenting an open 
forum on the con trover ial 
Coor Beer brewing company 
in the near future . Gina 
Capalpo, Public Affairs 
Director for the station, is 
hopeful that the forum " will 
inform people and allow them 
to make their own decisions" 
about the firm ' activities. 

The forum , the fir tCoors has 
ever held on a' college radio 
'tation, i tentatively sched-
uled for February 5, this date 
pending approval by the Co or 
representatives. According to 
Capalbo, "the forum i being 
held becau e KSDT 'wishes to 
have open discussion about the 
nature of the Coors company 
before it con iders airing 
programs such a 'My tery i 
My Hobby ,' which. although 
are not spon ored by Coor , 
have public service announce-
ments which mention the Coor 
name. Even though the Locul 
11366 (a brewer's union) ha 
been voted out through a de-
certification election through a 
71 0/( vote und the boycott is 
officially culled off. there' till 
a lot of controver y ubout the 
Coor employment policy and 
K DT ha, decid d to us an 
open forum through th 
cooperation of 001' to get 
i ' ues out in the open."

ager. will represent Coors in 
th· lorum . Benites i: the

American Citizen ) . The other 
Coors repre entative will be 
Susan Brooker , who has 
worked a a sale repre-
entative for Coors and is now 

coordinating a campus 
repre entation program. 

The students who initially 
howed interest in the forum 

were enthu iastic, but mall in 
number. Capalbo attributes 
this to the fact tha t the fir t pre-
forum meeting wa chedul ed 
during the tenth week of th 
qua rter , with one new pa per 
article for pUblicity. " The end 
of last quarter wa a n 
inopportune time to start this

hope to get a more repre en-

ta t iv'e turnout at Monday' 
meeting."

Te Burke: Overly 
Intellectual, 
Condescending 

Editor: 

Well, golly-gee MISTER Ted 
Burke. After reading your 
" art" review on songs from '78, 
I don' t know whether to lick 
your much too sophisticated 
ass , or to treat you like the 
supreme critic of all time. 

TIle a.., ••• ,rI., ..... 12, 1m 

Maybe both? I realize that your 
purpose is to benefit a ll of us 
with your superior knowledge 
of the current music scene, but. 
must we go through a II the 
rhetorical bullshit? What is this 
stuff (yes, stuff) you ' re 
writing? Upon reading your 
Monday piece, the only thing I 
gained from it (after looking up 
every other word in the 
dictionary) was your very own 
biased opinion 011 what is good 
and what isn 't - and frankly I 
question some of y our 
preferences . It seems like 
you ' re writing for yourself. 
That would really be unfair 

since you 've already looked up 
the words . Come down orr your 
flying - saucer and stop 
speaking martian, damn It! Get 
rid of the fancy language or get 
rid of yourself. Besides, Dylan 
says the same thing no matter· 
how he sings his tune. Hey -
m a ybe you could learn 
something there. What 
prompted me to be so cruel in 
the first place was my rage at 
finding some of my Cavorites on 
your shit list. I say you' re crazy 
and that Springsteen, Young, 
Dylan, Gabriel , Tull and Devo 
have all pleased me this past 
year. Who 's next? The Stones? 

A Goodbye Letter 
Some Thoughts on Leaving UC San Diego 

I've come to the conclusion 
that your ability to write with 
all its grandiose vocabulary is 
just an overcoat, five sizes too 
big for the exhibitionist inside 
of it. Stick to fiction, Ted. I 
know you ' re better at it. 

Virginia Bisek 

Dear Chancellor McElroy, 
This is a letter of suggestion 

and a goodbye. I am trans-
ferring as of January 29. The 
suggestions I mention are 
these. Something must be done 
to make undergraduates here 
feel wanted, and enjoy their 
time here. 

Il is my speculation that this 
campus was planned in a 

Let Saltman ·Go 
We're Better Off With Him in Texas 

Editor: 
Your article on J enkel 's use 

of his discretionary funds to 
a ppear before a committee 
c on si de r ing h i ring Vice-
chancellor of Academic Affairs 
P a ul Saltm a n dem a nd s 
res ponse . While no special 
friend of John J enkel; or the 
ASUCSD for that mat ter , there 
are c learly d isce rn a bl e 
j ustifications for this expen-
diture. Anything which gets 
Saltman off campus is worth it. 
(It is too bad, however, that he

while even less honest , would 
h ave se r ved t he pu r pose 
better.) 

It was interesting to note that 
the Texas students had the good 
sense to abolish their AS . Ours, 
of course, was closed down in 
'72, and I hope to see it close 
shop again before I leave this 
institution. An AS serves no 
useful purpose, and appear s to 
be incapable of functioning, let 
a lone functioning e((ectively. 

I hope that this article was n't 
your piece of investigating 
journali m for the year. If you 
want to tal". about AS financial 
indiscretions, there are pl enty 

available about which to write . 
The AS has made a habit of 
spending money with no 
conceivable justification, but 
this was an exception to this 
habit. Although the visit may 
not have the intended effect (of 
getting rid of Salt man) it was at 
least a good try.

manner to prevent any such 
disturbances as were seen at 
Berkeley a few years ago. The 
four colleges, geographically 
separated as they are, serve 
this purpose admirably. The 
lack of even good athletic 
teams here prevent any 
opportunity for more than one 
or two hundred people to ever 
assemble. I will say, however, 
that I admire and have 
benefited from the emphasis on 
participation in sports here, as 
I played water polo and rowed 
last year. 

The charge has been made 
that at UCSD, once an 
exclusively graduate campus, 
the undergraduate is unwanted 
and unloved. r am sure that this 

. is not University policy, but I 
cannot he lp but feel that the 
situation does exist. 

Leaving UCSD Cor a college 
of 1600, where classes average 
thirteen , I was espe.cially 
concerned with the size of my 
lecture c lasses here. As a 
matter of fact , while applying 
to transfer, I could not think of 
two professors who would know 
me well enough to recommend 
me. Professors to me are 
people who stand fifty yards 
awa y, and can be seen up close 
in office hours for a couple 
hours ~ week. I strongly feel 
that where large lectures are 
necessa ry, a nd I realize that at 
times they are undoubtedly 
unavoida ble , the professor 
himself should run or at least 
attend all sections . The 
teaching assistants that I have 
had in my four quarters here, in 
all types of courses, have 
generally been inadequate. 
Usually the T . A . s are 
undergraduates that are barely 
more knowledgeable than 
myself, and have no teaching 
experience or ability . Dis-
cussion or dissension have 
never been a part of my 
experience here. These, in my 
opinion, are all but prerequisite 
to learning. 

Professor-run sections and 
more office hours are needed! I 
realize this is a strain on the 
time of our faculty, at a time 
when wages have been frozen. 
My father is a professor at 
UCSF a nd I realize how busy a 
professor can be. However, the 
purpose of the University of 
California is EDUCATION!! 

I also feel that more support, 
promotion , and funding should 
be given for: 

11 performances by big name 
musical groups 

2) athletic teams 

3) recruiting and providing 
scholarships for athletes, 
maybe only for one or two 
teams. 

These priorities may seem 
anti-intellectual, but I think 
that the depressingly low 
retention at UCSD is a direct 
reflection of the quality of 
student life here. I also think 
that even some noise, or an 
'address by yourself to the 
students would be encouraging. 

As I prepare to leave this 
University, at which, I might 
add, I have enjoyed myself 
immensely, I plan to pay a fine 

I in order not to leave any debts 
behind when I leave. I was not 
surprised that at this place, 
where transactions are on 
computer cards , grades are on 
curves , and the under-
graduates are on the bottom, I 
have received numerous 
threatening notes to pay a fine 
to the chemistry dePf.rtment 
for a lab course. Fine! Having 
never taken a lab course, I 
was naturally curious . 
Apparently, there was some 
broken glassware, itemized, 
and a fine for not having 
procured the proper signature 
when I dropped the course -
a f~ a few minutes on the first 
day . Thalthe T.A. had told mel 
had done everything neces-
sary, and was free to go, comes 
as no surprise to me. I have 
already related my feelings 
concerning T.A.s (This is 
offered as an example of the 
undergraduate experience, not 
as a plea for cancellation of the 
fine.) I will pay the fine. As the 
man at the chemistry 
equipment office told me, there 
could not have been any 
mistake - the system is sound. 

In your efforts to run and 
improve this University, vou 
have my support and en-
thusiasm.

Shah Will Leave I ran,

Former Cambodian

WASHINGTON (AP) - Sec-
retary of State Cyrus R. Vance 
said Thursday the Shah of Iran 
plans to form a regency council 
in the next few days and 
afterward will take a foreign 
vacation. 

U . S . oUidals denied , 
however, that Vance's unusual 
disclosure of the future plans of 
a foreign head of stat.e was an 
attempt to preclude a decision 
by the Shah to remain in Iran to 
continue the fight for his 
throne.

Doonesbu.ry 
Deletion 

WS ANGELES (AP) - A 
spokesman for the Los Angeles 
Times said yesterday that 
some readers complained after 
the newspaper declined to 
publish a cotroversial 
" Doonesbury" comic strip 
about Se.n. John Warner, R-Va. 

In a statement explaining the 
decision, The Times said the 
strip was not published 
Wednesday "because after 
thorough checkine, we could 
not substantiate Inferences in 
the strip that seriously 
questioned the integrity of 
certain public figures ." 

A Times spokesman said 
yesterday that the newspaper 
received " between 100 and 200 
calls. Some just wanted to know 
where the strip was, some 
complained of censorship." 

In Wednesday's comic strip, 
the cartOon figure Dick sa id to 
his wife: " Remember when the 
pa rty 's origina l nominee died 
in that accident ? The Warners 
were so stricken with sympathy 
that they or -~ red to ta ke on the 
campa igr. debt a nd to set up a 
t rust fu d for the family . Guess 
who was then tapped the next 
day? " 

The Richmond Virginia 
Times Dispa&eb published the 
strip but added an editor's note 
saying the cartoon might offend 
some people. The Times 
Dispa&eb said it was print ' .. 
the strip because failure to 
so might be considered 
censorship. 

EarUer this week," Doones-

was censured by the Republi· 
can Caucus of the Virginia 
General Assembly for bls satire 
of Warner and Miss Taylor. The 
censure was prompted by an 
earlier strip that referred to 
Warner as "Mr. Elizabeth 
Taylor." 

Trudeau's fictional charac-
ter, Dick, husband of a 
congresswoman, referred ~,) 
Warner In a Tuesday strip as 
" some dim dilettante who 
managed to buy, marry and 
luck his way in to the U.S. 
Senate."

The Vietnamese, possibly 
operating with pro-Vietnamese 
Cambodian units, reportedly 
seized Siem Reap, 140 miles

Vietnamese planes attacked 
Battambang, 20 miles farther

major area still in the hands of 
the toppled government. 

However, Carter Admini-

recent days that they now look 
on the Shah's continuing 
presence as an impediment to a 
restoration of order. 

The Shah has indicated he

the timing . The regency council

Vance said, adding that he did 
not know how long the monarch 
plans to be out of the country. 

American officials have said 
the principal risk the Shah runs 
in taking a vacation abroad is 
that circumstances may

This is the story. A Gennan 
immigrant , Louis Rose 
reached San Diego over the old 
Santa Fe Trail on May 30,1850, 
the first Jew here. 

He found a sleepy Mexican 
village. which we now call Old 
Town. Mud-brick adobes faced 
a plaza. The streets were mixed 
sand and horse-<iroppings. 

A slight, humble man, he 
arrived poor, listing his 
occupation in the 1150 Census 
as"laborer." He· found a job 

and saved money. 
In time he opened a butcher 

shop, a general store. and ran a 
hotel. With his income he 
invested in more daring 
enterprises. 

He had an idea about 
seaweed. He devised a method 
of removing impurities and 
sterilizing this marine alga.

substance. 

He hired men to process the 
seaweed and stuff it into 
mattress covers. Hi s mattress 

company was one of the Cirst 
San Diego industries. 

He bought land. He purchas-
ed SO acres on the west side of 
San Diego Bay and started a 
town called Roseville. today 
it is the business district of 
Point Loma. 

He had another idea. He saw

Third College, Women's 
Center EaSing Re-entry 

by Katby Huffer 
Staff Writer 

For women who drop out of 
college to start a family or work 
full-time, returning years later 
can be a challenging and 
frightening experience. Until 
recently, little attention has 
been focused upon these "re-
entry" women at UCSD. 

A coordnated effort by the 
Women's Center and the Third 
College Dean's office ' is now 
being made to help define and 
ease the problems that re-entry 
women must face at UCSD. 
They are presently organizing 

a series of weekly workshops 
which will be geared speci· 
fically toward these women. 

The University derines a re-
entry student as a man or 
woman of at least }5 years of 
age who returns to college after 
having interrupted their 
education for several years. 
According to Susan Montrose, 
Third College Asst. Dean 
nearly 200 re-entry students 
currently attend UCSD. Of that 
number, an estimated half are 
women . These women . 
Montrose said, face special 
problems and are under .. a 
tremendous amount of 

pressure." As a result a series 
of workshops have . been 
planned to bring re-entry 
women together and assess 
their needs at UCSD. 

Linda Ruffing. a work-study 
member of the Women 's 
Center . is in charge of 
organizing the workshops. A re-
entry student herself, Ruffing 
is planning a series of sessions 
to offer older women "problem-
solving techniques," she said. 
The workshops will be held at 
the Women's Center. 

According to Ruffing, the 
workshops will' deal with such

UCSD Will Get Another Shot 

Argentinian 
Kickers Blast 

Tritons, -8-1 
By John Klock 

A makeshift UCSD soccer 
team never really had a chance 
Wednesday. when they faced a 
touring team from Argentina. 
The fi na I score, 8· 1 (or the 
visitors, left no doubt on that 
point. 

years. according to Bascou. 
" The Argentines were much 

more precise. They work well 
together and they are a well-
balanced team, with no glaring 
weaknesses. Their experience 
especially showed in their 
pace. We took longer to do what 
we wanted. setting up a shot. or 
passing. or whatever. They are 
(ree to look around, and think 
about what to do next, where 
our guys are c.'Oncentrating on 
their technique," Hayes said. 

But even the opportunity to 
learn from the more skilled 
Latin American players was 
limited. according to Stewart 
Hayes. coach of the varsity 
intercollegiate soccer team. 
which was joined by some third 
team UCSD club players for the 
game. 

" USF would test most pro 
teams, ,. Hayes said. "They 
(the Argentines) are ID for UCSD goalie Pat Robinson saves a goal against the visiting Argentina team Wednesday. 

" The benefits get lost when 
you lose by a score like that.·· 
said Hayes. " You just get 
rrustrated.'· 

No maller. There will bG 
another chance to watch the 
vis itors' more developed skills 
today at 3 pm when the premier 
UCSD soccer club team plays 
the Argentines on Muir field. 

Hayes promised that today 's 
game will be more of a contest 
s ince the first club team is in 
rirst place in loca l league play. 

" They·1I have to earn their 
goals,'· he said. 

In Wednesday's game. they 
often did not. In fact, despite 
the score of 3·1 a fter the first 
half. there was talk among the 
home players o( a possible 
second-half comebacl( . Be-
cause of the nat.ure of 
Argentina 's first goals. the 
match seemed closer than they 
had expected. 

"Two oftheir goals in the first 
ha lf were just mistakes on our 
part. " Hayes said. 

The optimism melted away. 
however, as the Argentines 
penetrated and scored quickly 
in the second half. "We ran out 
of gas," Hayes explained. 

The US players had several 
disadvantages. They were not 
used to playing together, since 
they were drawn from two 
different teams. They were also 
"out of shape" according to 
Hayes. the intercollegiate team 
not having played since mid-

V-bailers Face Uncertain Future 
Young Team Hampered by Lack of Experience 

By Karen Hanter 
Sporil Edilor 

"Excellent teamwork and 
strong defense" are the two key 
strengths of this year's 
intercollegiate volleyball team. 
according to first year coach 
Doug Dannevik. 

With a roster of 15 players, 
selected from an original 50 
who tried out, Dannevik 
described his team as " young, 
with not much game exper-
ience." 

.. All of our players have had 
some kind of competitive 
experience. either in high 
school or college," Dannevik, 
the former volleyball coach at 

Patrick Henry High in San 
Diego, explained. "However, 
only five have played on the 
UCSD team before," he added. 

Two of the five veterans, 
Bob Rhodes a nd Erik Willis. 
are currently injured and will 
not be able to compete in this 
Sunday's All-Cal tournament at 
UC Davis. Daonevik will be 
starting the remaininR three 
vets: senior John Lee. captain 
Steve Upp and junior Dave 
Perkin. 

"We are inexperienced and 
make some mistakes, " the 
coach revealed, "but we'll be 
good later on. The thing that 
reaJly holds us together is that 

we want to be good. The guys 
hustle at practice and put forth 
their best effort. A great 
comraderie exist on this 
team. " 

Eric Zarakov and sophomore 
John Mooney were cited by the 
coach as the .. super hustlers" 
who really get the team going. 
Dannevik also mentioned that 
Steve Lee will be an important 
player coming orr the bench (or 
the Tritons this season. Will 

Triggs singled out as a good 
passer and Hal Jacobs as a 
good player in the front line by 
Dannevik. 

Last Saturday the team 
played their first match against 
a tough San Diego All-Star 
team. Composed mainly of 
SDSU alumni, including some 
former All · Americans, the AlI-
Stars beat the Tritons, 16-14,15-
9. 15-13 . (Please turn to page 7)

In addition they had very 

little warning of the upcoming 
game. Hayes said although he 
was contacted in t\ugust by the 
Argentine club about the 
possibility of giving them a 
place to stay, it was not until he 
returned from the winter break 
to find a letter confirming their 
plans, that he knew if and when 
they would be here. 

" I had (rom Sunday till

them. Most of them are on

"There were a lot more

Gleaves ~marked. Three

Nation Scholastic Surfing 
Association (NSSA) National 
Cbampionsbip, alao held at 
Huntington Beacb. 

Nielsen reached the semi-
final round of competition 
before being eliminated. 
Nonetheless, he was still 
named to be on the 18 member 
national team based on his 
surfing performances in NSSA 
competitions and his good 
grades. 

Gleaves admitted that he 
"barely made it" into the finals 
heat. "The waves weren't so 
good so I waited for awbile and 
decided to move over close to 
the pier." From there, Gleaves 
found the waves he wanted and 
went on to win the title. 

"I had a good sense of where 
to find the best waves, " the 
surfer disclosed. "Huntington 
Beach is where I learned to 
surf. As the tide goes out, the 
waves usually get better. " 

One month later, Gleave's 
teammate, Bert Nielsen, 
competed against surfers from 

Nielsen received a new 
surfboard and wetsuit for bis 
efforts and will also be given 
the opportunity to compete 
intern'ationally as a new 
member of the U.S. team,

be accumulated. 
"I was really happy, " 

exclaimed Nielsen when asked

Strong Defense Needed 
For Volleyball Team 
(Continued from page 5) 

"I Celt we played really well," 
commented Dannevik. "The 

II·Stars were good competi-
lion. I've scheduled tough 
teams on purpose for our first 
five games so our weaknesses 
will show up early in the season 
and we can correct them." 

Among these weaknesses 
Dannevik feels are lack of 
experience and lack of height. 
" Our tallest guy is 6'3" and we 
only have one of those. It is 
hard to compete against teams 
with severa I rea Ily tall 
players." 

" Defense is our number one 
concern," Dannevik feel!; 

"Defense can win ball games." 

The team has been working 
hard on defensive tactics, 
something that hasn't been 
stressed in the past. "Our team 
has had three coaches in thf 
past three years. It takes a 
while to get used to my way of 
coaching. The players have to 
familiarize themselves with 
my defensive techniques." 

The All-Cal will provide 
tough competition for the 
Tritons . UCLA and UCSB are 
ranked among the top five 
teams in the nation. " If we get 
fourth place in the tourney I 
feel we' ll have been reaily 
successful. "

such example is the water-

concentrates on improvisation

The Music of Sound and Lipt

improvisation of the two 
subjects. In addition to the 
three ensembles, various 
musicians present concerts

And then, there is also Wba&'1

the -areas of art,drama,music, 
poetry,and theater. This year' s 
effort will be a unique one: a 
camping trip to the desert. 

Conference was "the largest 
effort made." Held during late 
October, it had a helty 
registration of over 300 
participants heraldinl from all 
parts of the world. Despite the 
large number, the center 
undertook the task successfully 
and without incident, save for 
an unavoidable campuawide 
power failure , which tempora-
rily dampened a scheduled 
concert.. . an event Oliveros 
recalls as "apocalyptic." 

Department seminars and 
workshops are sponsered from 
time to time as well.

Good and Bad • Review SD Theatre In 
By Jill-LOUise Bazeley 

C ... 'rlbu'iJI, EcUtor 
In no particular order, I here 

have assembled the opposing 
ranks of recent San -Diego 
theatre yays and yucks. Since 
it is all on an unCactual, 
opinionated and arbitrary 
basis, I suggest trying ~ 
grain of salt (skip the full glass 
of water and ignore the FDA 
warning) if it disagrees with 
you. 

BEST: 1. A Midsummer 
Nig."s Dream: The Old Globe 
Theatre rallied to present the 
most polished and enjoyablp., 
a lbe it c ut e, flurry a nd 
bastardized Shakespeare 
production I have seen there in 
the last few years. 

2. Hold Me: Jules FeifCer's 
agreeably short play about 
loneliness a nd disillus ionment 
tion of Osca r Wilde's plum, but 
good humor at the San Diego 
Repertory Theatre. 

3. Zoo, Suil was not in San 
Diego but should have been. 
The Mark Taper Forum put its 
da rk horse laboratory success 
on the mainstage and then 
headed oCf to Broadway with a 
moving piece of chicano 
theatre that wiJI turn heads and 
minds Cor a while to come. 

4. The ImportaDee of BeiD' 
Earnest: A typically wel1-
styled confectionary produc-
tion of Oscar Wilde's plum, btltr 
rendered intelligently askew by 
the rich and sumptuous set, 
which was, after all , only 
corrugated cardboard. 

S. American BaIlet Theatre: 
the best thing to come ofC the 
road. The DoD Quixote pas de 
deux was danced to perfection

who have shown their

dance,fiIm, or other related 
areas) , musicians (either 
visiting or in residence) , and 
outside participants (such as 
an authority on mandala,a 
voice specialist,or a psychoac-
coustician), who, according to 
Oliveros , " make a special 
contribution to the work that 
goes on." 

Undergraduate students are 
welcome if they have a project 
requiring CME's services. 
Financial backing for all 
research must CODle Crom the 
researcher's resources, as the 
center does not offer grants. In 
fact, funding from its major 
contributors, the Ford and 
Rockefeller FoundatIons. f1 a 
finished its course, leaving 
CME to seek other moneta ry 
means. The center is now 
receiving aid Crom the National 
Endowment of the Arts and 
UCSD. 

One need only glance at the 
CoUowing list of colloquium 
events for January and 
February - to concur:" Face, 
F igure, Form" by Minette 
Lehmann on January 11 , " Does 
Technology Invite Isolation or 
Inte r ac tion ?" by Linda 
Monta no on January 12, 
" Software for People" by 
Pauline Oliveros on January 25, 
" T he Perfonnance of Shaman-
ism" by Diane Rothenberg on 
February I , " Attention to 
Attention in the Fine Arts" by 
Lester [ngber on Februa ry 8, 
a nd " The New Perfonner and 
the Music of Our Times" by 
Bert Turetzky on Februa ry l5. 

(including the 32 fouettes with 
doubles on every Courth) and 
more modem works such as 

. JardiD aaJ: Li1as were stunning. 
Too bad the Fox Theatre has 
terrible sightlines. 

•. The Robher BridlfOOm: 
The Old Globe ' s musica l 
endeavor delighted the 
hayseeds out of me both times I 
saw it. Some homicide victims, 
however, might object to the 
theme of murder in the second 
act. 

7. Ballet Trockadero de 
Monte Carlo: ok, so I like ballet, 
but this exceptional parody 
qua lifies as comedy a lso, in a 
clownish way. fda e versay-
never's e ight ra mbling rouettes 
d isappointed me, though. (If 
anyone doesn 't know what this 

thing " fouette" is, and wants 
to, drop by The Guardian Cor a 
free demonstration. There are 
one or two oC us who might be 
able to pull one off.) 

WORST: I. The Winter' s 
Tale: ho-hum. Where was the 
bear as per Shakespeare' s 
stage directions, Old Globe 
Theatre? Or did you ever read 
them? 

2. Tom Thumb: there's more 
to the title of Henry Fielding's 
silly play than that, but who 
c are s ? The San Diego 
Reportory Theatre put a lot of 
energy into it , but to no avail. It 
was still si11y. 

3. Vanities: the Miss ion 
Playhouse is finally moving to 
new quarters, so maybe things 
won' t be so cramped anymore.

SD Disco: La Jolla Boogie on Campus 
This Bi-Cycle IS Closer to 'Summer 
Than Queen as La Jolla G'ets Soul 

By JobD HODdros 
Disco lovers, get excited! 

'Cause Bebe and Donnie are 
gonna get down this Friday 
night 'at the, uh, well, Muir 
Cafeteria. 

Hubba, hubba, ding, dong! 
San Diegans BeBe Gonzalez, 

20, and Donnie Singer, 21 are 
riding toward a disco hit with 
their single, "Bi-Cycle." The 
locally produced single was co-
written by Singer and m anager 
Robert "Rac" Racouilla t of La 
Jolla. 

Diego disco-goers. On side A is 
an original composition by 
Singer called, " Lady Rhythm" 
and on the flip side, " Bi-Cycle." 
The music is definitely disco: 

I gM a bicycle. built for two 
ADd lUke ridin' my bike with 

you ... 
DO THE BIKE-DO THE 

BIKE-DO THE BIKE-DO THE 
BIKE-DISCO ... 

RIDE-RIDE-RIDE! 
Gonzalez and Singer met 

while members of the Aztec 
choir a year ago at San Diego 

State University, The two 
began singing Top 40 tunes, as 
well as songs peMed by Singer, 
at local night clubs . They left 
SDSU last spring, and are 
currently attending the Dick 
Grove Music School in Los 
Angeles. "rhe duo" would like to 
have a San Diego hit and then 
take it national." It' s going to 
take a lot of peddling. 

Gonzalez and Singer will be 
performing January 12 at 9: 30 
pm in the Muir CaCeteria. You 
will have to fish out a buck at 
the door. "Bi-Cycle" is a disco version 

of an early '60's record called 
" The Bike Hop," which, by the 
way, was recorded by Billy 
Adams and the Pedal Pushers . 
on the Ra Ra label. Singer and 
Rac believe the song has a 
commercial gimmick poten-
tial. Gimmick, indeed, The 
charming people at Arthur 
Murray's Dance Studio have 
already devised the " Bike 
Hustle" dance to go with the 
song. (Dance steps included 
with the record) 

Atomic Cafe Postponed 

BeBe and Donnie's 45 has 
become popular among San 

Erratum: Contrary to whatis 
in Monday's " Around Town," 
there- will be no Atomic Cafe 
presentation this Tuesday. The 
first show oC the quarter will be 
January 30, in the Mandeville 
Recital Hall. Program to be 
announced soon.

Louis Rose 
Honored 
By Plaque 
(Continued from page 4) 
a nd made into Jeather 
products, some of which would 
be sent back to San Diego for 
sale. 

Rose saw an opportunity, 
Why not build a tannery and 
make shoes, bags, and saddles 
in San Diego? 

So he bought a rancho north 
of Old Town for his tannery. 
There he also started a 
brickyard. That land is known 
as Rose Canyon. 

Louis Rose died at the age of 
80 ~February 12,1 .... 

In 1934 iDterested citizens 
dedicated a monument to him. 
One surviving daulhter of Rose 
attended and said that her 
father could "never dream of 
the honor you are bestowing 
upon him today." 

The boulder and plaque stood 
at the head of Rose Canyon, at 
the intersection of old coast 
Highway 101 and the road 
leading oU to La Jolla. 

But iD the mid-sixties came 
the bulldozen. The bilhway 
was moved East. Andaboutthe 
Rose marker roee the campus, 

If LouIs Rose came back 
today he'd be doubly startled-
that a moDument bad been 
erected in bi8 honor, and that a 
uDlvenity bad ariMo 011 the site 
of tu. old property.
