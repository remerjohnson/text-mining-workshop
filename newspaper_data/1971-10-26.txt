academic cheating on campus. No one the same, with the burden of proof 
knows for sure why students cheat resting heavily on the teachers. 
here at UCSD and in other colleges according to Dean Beckley. 
across the country. But by talking to CD 
our deans it became clear that The Reasons Why 
pressure and the University structure 
playa major role in causing a student 
toplagiarize or cheat in a class. 

Plagiarism and cheating are 
" nothing new" either here or 
anywhere else in the country says Jim 
Beckley. Administrators have always 
had to deal with the problem. But 
according to a report, few have 
realized how great the problem was 
and how large it has now become. 

"StartliDg Statistics" 
In a report of student dishonesty 

made by Columbia University. some 
startling statistics were revealed. 
Through the use of a questionnaire sent 
to students and faculty , it was revealed 
that almost half of the students in 
colleges have cheated during their 
stay. But the deans of each college, on 
the average, thought that the number 
was only one-third as large. "Even 
students underestimate the number of 
cheaters in their midst ; they tend to 
believe that only about half as many 
have cheated as their self-reports 
indicated." It is in this light that the 
problem should be analyzed. 

Cheating, according to Tom Hull, 
can be found in "all kinds of flavors" 
here on campus. Cheating ranges from 
having someone else take an exam for 
you, or do your thesis. to improperly 
footnoting a sentence. And it is this 
great diversity which creates the 
difficulty in properly dealing with the 
problem. Thus, many cheaters are 
never punished for their actions. 

Presently at Revelle. a teacher must 
charge a student with cheating and be 

to the Committee. 
There he will be able to defend himself 
of the charges just like in any 
courtroom. But because a professor 

I . 

the student a chance to do the work 
right or by giving an incomplete. To 
further complicate matters, many 
times there are no clear standards as 

triton-ti 

Both deans felt that the most 
important question .acing the 
University today is not how students 
cheat, but wby do students cheat. Here 
at UCSD the two largest reasons seem 
to be pressure and the University 
structure. 

The deans spoke at great length 
about how pressure affects UCSD 
students. They said that the pressures 
come from parents for the students to 
do well in school ; from the Draft for 
those who don 't do well ; from 
scholarships to get and keep a high 
GPA ; and from the chronic lack of 
money and time. 

Dean Hull said that for some this 
pressure becomes overwhelming and 
they are forced to cheat. The 
temptation is even greater, he added. 
when one realizes how "easy it is to 
cheat and get away with it," due to the 
reasons which have already been 
mentioned. 
Pressure is not the major cause 

according to Paul Kaufman. president 
of the Associated Students. According 
to him, " the University structure is a 
major cause of student cheating." 
Because some students believe that 
their required courses are a " waste of 
time", they tend to devote little or no 
effort in these classes. As a result. 
they must cheat in order to pass the 
class and graduate. For these students. 
"education has become subservient to 
grades." Cheating is thus only a 
"symptom of the disease of the 
University."

Volume '4, Number 9 

TRITO TIMES : Could you de cribe your main duties as 
assistant provost to provide an idea of your capacity in this 
position? Ledden : One part of my job which is ill-defined 
because there is nothing unusual about it is my concern for the 
academic quality dev610pment of the college. It concerns 
everal things. since I function in everal ways. For example. 

just the generalleyel of academic advising where the students 
fo llow a program which helps them : but it also involves 
dealing with the faculty and student in ways that I don 't really 
believe we have done so far. Suppose. for example. that we 
have in one of our general education course a man who just 
does not do a very good job. We then take steps to make that 
man realize that he must take steps to correct the situation. 
Many times. however. the man just doesn't realize that his 
teaching is not very good. so the information must be received 
from sources other than himself . 
TT : What steps do you take in a case such a this? 
Ledden : There are all kinds of systematic procedures that Wt! 
arc trying to develop. like teaching evaluation programs which 
were tried experimentally la t year. They are spending a lot of 
time trying to determine their value. But I'm not sure that one 
has to be 0 cientific. As the faculty th m elve often admit. 
· ... m just not doing a good job in Uii cour . and what am I 
doing wrong?" If we are getting student respon e to the 
cour e. and that. I might add is what we are looking for . then 
we say that student re ponse ugg sts that you are not teaching 
the cour e at the right level. that you are either in too low or in 
too high . and he might reply that he will try to take that into 
consideration throughout the rest of the course. Or if we get to 
the in tructor too late and the cour e i pretty well oyer but 
cheduled again next quarter . we will try to get this 

information to him. If a man. oyer time. show himself to be 
unable to contend with one of our required courses. we will try 
to move him to the upper division where he won't have these 
problems to contend with . So in that respect we would be 
helping both sides. as we would improve both the general 
education course by making sure that we had good instructors 

in there. and we would afiord that man an opportunity to teach 
the cour e that he wants to teach . Yet I'm not ure that one 
has to be so cientific about collecting information : it's more 
of an advisory thing. But one part of it i keeping track of the 
faculty. not ort of a " Big Brother is watchIng" thing, becau e 
this would make the faculty re ent u . but 0 that th overall 
quality of the courses offered is good. 
TT : Do you feel that Muir college is. at this time. lacking in 
breadth a far as courses offered is concerned? 
Ledden : I think that we should respond more to student 
interest in subjects as yet not offered at Muir. For example. I 
would like to ee creative writing courses at MUir . and I'd 
really like to see a good year-Io 19 course in Western 
Civilization. 
TT : But aren't the e cour es already offered to Muir students? 
Ledden : Yes. but not in lower divi ion. Many other universitie 
do not offer courses equivalent to Hi tory 30 becau e they are 
terribly hard courses to teach. but I encourage that type of 
thing. because I feel that preparatory cour es of that nature 
are very u eful. I'd like to ee course that are cha llenging and 
ones which fill gap in our educational program. and that i 
al 0 part of the assi tant provo t ' job. ince many faculty 
want to teach cour e that we don 't know about. . . 
TT : Do you think that th majority of the e cour e can b 
taught without a n c itv for th creation of n w 
d partm nt ? . 
Ledden : Certainly. I think that we have a rath r larg fa ulty . 
and that not all of them are overworked as far a teaching 
undergraduate go s. and I think that we have not indicated to 
the faculty that we are intere ted in cour e r form . e p clall 
in the lower division . and I think that the niv r ity of 
California now i placing mor and mQj'e empha is on 
undergraduate education than in pa t year . In the pa t. I think 
that one of the things which di couraged u h coW' e wa that 
very little value was attached to them . 
TT : How effective are student "demand " for new cour ? 
Ledden : I haven 't really heard any demands for new cour e . 
TT : Have there been any demand analogou to recent continued on Pile 2 



Jewish bus on Revelle Plaza 
.. A bus in Revelle Plaza I " came the cry last Thursday 

afternoon, and sure enough, there was a bus in Revelle Plaza -
the Soviet Jewry Freedom Bus. 

The Soviet Jewry Freedom Bus is a bus which is traveling to 
every major city in the U.S. informing and educating people on 
the cause of Soviet Jewry. Aboard the bus art' five permanent 
passengers : three American students and two recently -
emigrated Soviet Jews. 

Tsiporah Wolf, a blond Jewess from the city of Perm in the 
Ural mountains, spoke to UCSD students and facully after 
being officially welcomed to the campus by Provost Sallman. 
She spoke about the underground Jewish activist movement in 
Russia , explaining how difficult it was to do anything without 
escaping surveillance by the KGB. " Everything is done in 
fear ," she said, " but we do it anyway." She then explained how 
difficult it was to obtain an exit visa from the Soviet 
authorities : " It is completely by chance who gets a visa and 
who does not. They have many thousands of visa for Jews to 
leave the U.S.S.R., but they pick only a few at a time. It takes 
many years to leave." 

Accompanying the bus was an array of visual displays and 
some books and records concerning Soviet Jews. 

Circulated among the crowd was a petition protesting the 
treatment of Jews in the Soviet Union , which upon the arrival 
of the bus in Washington will be presented to Anatoly 
Dobrynin. Soviet Ambassador to the United States. The 
spon_sors of the Bus hope to arrive in Washington with 500.000 
signatures.

Asian Students cite deficits in fOP to Murphy 
Mark MalSoka 

Twenty representatives from 
the Asian - American Student 
Alliance, White Caucus, and 
United Native Americans met 
with Vice - Chancellor Murphy 
on Oct. 21 to discuss their lack 
of representation wi thin the 
Equal Opportunity Program 
(EOP), A written proposal , 
drafted by the Asian American 
students, was later brought to 
Murphy stating the position of 
the Asian community on the 
issues that were discussed at 
the meeting. 

The primary purpose 01 the 
AASA proposal was to bring to 
the attention of the 
administration the plight of 
certain impoverished sectors 
of the Asian community which 
suffer because of the myth that 
most Asians have " made it" 
into the mainstream of 
American society. The AASA 
proposal cites the fact that of 
the 32,000 Filipinos in San 
Diego County, representing 2.5 
per cent of the population, only 
t8 Filipino students were 
recruited and accepted into 
UCSD under the EOP program. 
The national average income 
for Filipino families is under 
$3,000. 

Asian Staff Needed 
AASA feels that " the support 

and em pathy which are 
necessary to overcome the 
cultural shock suffered by most 
Asian EOP students upon 
entering UCSD can only be 
supplied by a trained and 
experienced staff of Asian 

minority administrators and 
counselors. A proposal to add 
to the current UCSD EOP 
structure and to transfer Asian 
recruitment from the hands of 
the Blacks and Chicanos into 
the self - determination of 
Asian people will be presented. 

" Presently on the 
administrative staff of EOP 
there is (1) black 
administrative assistant, (1) 
black FTE secretary, (1) black 
recruiter, (1) black 
counselor I advisor. (1) Chicano 
FTE secretary, (1) C hieano 
recruiter, ( I ) Chicano 
academic support 
coordinator," continues the 
proposal, The only positions 
Asians and Native Americans 
hold are two work-study 
student recruiter positions 
which, the proposal states, "do 
not hold for very much 
accountability in the 
program." 

George Murphy , as 
Executive Dean of Student 
Affairs, is the administrator in 
charge of the EOP, the 
primary funding program for 
minority students. Murphy had 
a very favorable reaction to the 
meeting, declaring. " I had a 
very good session and I hope 
my feeling is a shared one. r 
think they're very useful. One 
of the principal difficulties of 
programs of this sort is that 
they activate a mutual 
par anoia between 
administration and students. 
with neither really certain 

particularly go for things just because they are new. ( think 
that the academic environment here is very conducive to 
innovation. The juxtaposition of students. faculty and staff will 
hopefully result in substantially greater contact with all facets 
of college life. ('m not sure whether or not one can change this 
environment. and I'm not sure whether or not it's even 
important that the interests of both students and faculty are 
the same. 1 am inclined to think that the students set an 
academic environment much more than the faculty do, and I 
think that 's the only way it can be done. I would like to see a bit 
more enthusiasm about education than I have seen. 
IT: Following along the same line. there has been a recent 
trend among students with respect to student - faculty 
relationships toward what many students see as humanization 
of the University, where tudents want to know their 
professors as people rather than just as teachers. Do you fe~1 
that a philosophy of this sort is feasible under the present 
system of education? 
Ledden : I'm not really sure that thIS request has been made 
here. It has been my experience that students whom I have met 
a a faculty member have always eemed grateful and mildly 
surpri sed that someone thought of them as human beings, and 
have reacted as if this was not always the case. In that sense, 
perhaps you are correct in your assertion that the University is 
not always humane : that it has treated the student as an object

In response to a question 
about the racial imbalance in 
the EOP staff, Murphy replied, 
" I don't think there's any 
question about that. This EOP 
staff was developed at a time 
when our principal thrust was 
towards the Blacks and 
Chicanos. As the University 
becomes more and more aware 
of the other racial.,groups and 
their absence within the 
University , it becomes 
necessary to direct our 
programs to fit those needs. 

" I'd like to see this staff be 
totally representative of the 
racial groups it seeks to serve 
and I'm not limiting this 
direction to EOP, it should 
spread throughout the 
University ," Murphy 
continued, 

Responses to the meeting 
from AASA members were 
also favorable . Marlene Tuyay 
stated , " The meeting 
accomplished a lot. Mostly it 
s howed that the Asian 
Americans , the Native 
Americans and the poor whites 
can form a viable alliance in 
which we ar!' working in a non-
competitive way together 
towards our common goals." 

" Everyone has to realize that 
there are many poor Asians. 

poor Native Americans and 
poor whites with very 
important needs that bave to be 
dealt with. Unless we get 
representation in EOP, much 
of the Asian community will 
remain unaware of the 
potential services of EOP," 
added Phyllis Chiu. 

Speaking for the White 
Caucus, Paula Backus said, 
"We really have to make our 
posi tion known to other people. 
I ' m glad we had 
representatives at the meeting 
because AASA can't speak for 
us. I think our people will see 
that through the alliance, we 
will now have the strength to do 
what we couldn't do before," 
,. AboU,"e. CoDeept of Third 

World 
A differing opinion was 

voiced by one of the Native 
Americans present at the 
meeting , Roy Latin . In 
mentioning the way the 
different minorities at Third 
College are forced to compete 
among themselves for the 
scarce EOP resources, Roy 
directed his criticism towards 
the administration . " It 
abolishes the concept of the 
Third World," he said, " When 
minorities are given the real 
opportunity to work with other 
minorities in determining their 
own future, they will form 
much tighter bonds than when 
they work with administrators 
with paternalistic attitudes 
who serve as liaisons between 
the groups. " 

of education. On the other hand, as far as the students and 
faculty gelting to know each other as human beings, ('m not 
really sure that this is what is being requested. I think that 
students certainly want to be treated Like human beings. but I 
would seriously doubt that students would want to be a friend 
of mine. as they could be a friend of someone of their own age 
group. It is possible, however. for students and faculty to 
recognize each other as human beings ; I'd like to see a bumper 
sticker proclaiming "faculty ar-e human beings" or " lake a 
faculty member out to lunch ."

In recent past, TRITON TIMES critics have 

chastised this DaDer for its so·called 
"Right·wing" Editorial pages. "Why doesn't 
it change its make·up and reflect the 'true' feelings 
of the students?", they ask. 

Unfortunately, the answer ' to this query is 
ridiculously simple. The fact is, that those 
members of the UCSD community who have 
shouted the loudest over this assumed political 
bias in opinion columns, have been almost entirely 
unwilling to contribute to the paper when 
approached by the Editor. With nothing but almost 
exclusively 'Right·wing' columns being submitted, 
it becomes all but .impossible to print "Left·wing" 
opinion, 

The TRITON TIMES cannot "improve" its 
Editorial page's content unless those who shout 
are willing to contribute. If they wish to contribute, 
their opinions shall appear, but if they persist in 
complaining whilst contributing naught, the 
situation will not change. 

The Editorial Page is your page. What you 
contribute shall be printed, but as even the most 
casual observer must admit, it's impossible to 
print articles that have not been contributed,

on the trivial·CONTR I BUTE!!!!

Gerrymander San Diego Style 
by Jame C. Baker 

It is with regret that we announce the untimely 
death of representative government in San Diego 
County. The patient , who has been in poor heal th 
recently, died at 2 p.m .. Tuesday, Oct. 5 of major 
surgery lexploratory gerrymander ) in the north 
chambers of the San Diego County Board of 
Supervisors. Supervisors Boney. Bear. and 
Craven performed the operation. with 
Supervisors Walsh and Scheidle dissenting. In 
lieu of floral contributions. friends may 
contribute their outrage to the cause of thei'r 
choice. 

to the Bear plan, Supervisor Scheidle suggested 
that if this plan was. indeed. so Solomon·like, it 
could certainly bear the scrutiny of an impartial 
board to be .Ippointed to suggest a better plan. 
and that if none was better. they could still adopt 
it. aturallv. such reasonableness does not get 
one far in pOlitics. and this proposal was not even 
considered . 

In the words of the CHULA VISTA STAR 
NEWS. "Bear ~nd Boney. who have indicated 
they no longer want any part of the south bay 
(literally or figuratively ,. reportedly are ready 
to team up with Chairman William Craven to give 
the south bav to Walsh." The editorial goes on to 
state that Bear fought a plan by Boney which 
would have left Bear with only 25 percent of the 
voters who elected him - yel he blithely comes 
up with a plan which i finally adopted. which 
leaves Jack Walsh with onlv about 35,000 of the 
270.000 people in his previous district. 

Local government. which ca n immediately and 
directly affect the people. and which can 
I theoretically 1 be most accessible to the people. 
suffered a crushing blow at the last county 
supervisors meeting. In a move which will surely 
be written up in future histo ry books as a classic 
example of wholesale gerrymander , the Board. 
by a 3-2 vote. changed the elected representatives 
to the Board of over 60 percent of the population 
of San Diego County. And in a move which must 
certainly be unprecedented, Supervisor Walsh is 
left with a mere 15 percent of the people who 
elected him still in his district (and that only 
because a Supervisor must live in the area he 
represents I. The mind boggles at the innocent 
protestations of Supervisor Bear - whose plan 
was the one adopted - that this is a fair and 
impartial plan . 

Historicall y. thi plan was introduced

The mu.ic business is no different than any other business : 
put It on the market and try to sell it. Ever since J can 
r~mef!1ber. record companies have been flooding the stores 
With Just about anything that they can pa s off as music . 
Rather than well- thought - out· creativity, mo t of it is boring 
- u~origina! - repetitive - bull. And , as some of you may be 
notlcmg, thiS very thing is happening more and more . 

Dig it : you walk into a record store and almost before you 
can get past th door, you're hit with about five racks of sale 
albums ... stiffs like "Nick Navel and His Nine Nausiated 
Nosepickers." Once you wade through all of the crap and begin 
to look for something you heard on the radio two weeks ago 
that sounds something like ... " I'm sorry," the smiling 
sale man tells you, " but we're out of that now. We'll have it in 
next week." ARRGGHHH!!' 

But then again . some of the music these days is not all bad. 
For a long time. almost ever ince it came out. I've considered 
Dave Mason's album. "Alone To~ether" to be lhe best album 
J had ever heard. The material is presented well and the 
lhe production. the miXing. the musicianship. the tone. and 
sound that lh.e studio produce are all impeccable. But slowly, 
With every listen. Cat Stevens' new album , "Teaser and the 
Firecat" on A&M Records (SP 4313), is gaining with leaps and 
bounds. ThiS IS Cat Stevens ' fifth effort on disc and no doubt his 
best.

album received little FM airplay and didn't sell well at all . 
Things changed quickly, however, with the pre·album release 
of " Wild World" on a 45 to AM radio stations. The song did very 
well very quickly . and when the album was released . "Tea for

Half the fun of b mg a record reviewer is meeting head-on with 
the difficullY of expressing musie in words. Th temptation is 
to bullshit one's way through. with the music blaring in the 
background and a thesaurus be ide the typewriter. Given a 
certain amount of space to fill the writer sets out composing a 
mixed bag that usually leaves the reader dry. or bores him so 
much he never bothers to read another review again 
Unfortunately I can't fake it when writing. So take this as one 
artist 's opinion . and not gospel.

The idea are rea onable. but not ea rth-shattering. 
Unfortunatelv they' re all but lost m the immature production. I 
got the impression that a lot of hype and little thought went into 
the making of thi di c. But if you like " stone" R&B. it s on

.. Archie Shepp. Things Have Got To hange." features tht' 
voice of Joe Lee Wi! on (Impulse A 9212). Shepp and a ho t of 
24 celebrat the title with a cluttered mass of music. I gues 
it's the thing to ~ive artisls a free hand In recording Jazz. It's 
been a long time coming. and I'm thankful for it. But here 
Shepp has amassed and mfused so many artists and 0 many 
idea . thaI I rind it almo t too confusing to listen to. . 

The teacher from New York has his moments In " Dr. King . 
!he !"eaceflll ~arrior. " but it's just too noisy. But again . Shepp 
IS still searching for new mode of ex pre ion . and this feeling 
is enough to make me Ii ten again and again to the musIc. 
Shepp cOnlinues 10 bring to the listener young talent that needs

How shall we solve these problems? 
Dean Beckleyfeels that the " response 
to cheating should not be too rigid ." He 
would like, ralller, to see it prevented 
by supervising tests better. Paul 
Kaufman feels that we should create a 
place " where teachers do not teach, 
but rather help students to learn." He 
believes in the words of John Holt, 
author of How Chlldre. Fail, when 
Holt says, "students should be the 
planners, directors and assessors of 
their education." To aid this type of 
program, Kaufman suggests that there 
be "more flexible requirements, freer 
options to drop and less required 
classes." In this way Kaufman feels 
that students would devote their effort 
to c1asses which meant something to 
them and would not cheat their way 
through classes which were a " waste 
of time." 

A step in this direction can be found 
at Third College. Here, according to 
Pascuel Martinez, Dean at Third 
College " testing is done for the 
studentl, to see what he does know 
instead of testing to see what he 
doesn't know. In this way a student is 
encouraged to develop himself and 
"not try to measure up to oj pre-set 
goal." Although Third College is 
admittedly both young and small, still 
the fact that it has never had a 
reported case of cheating is not any 
less diminished. One cannot say 
conclusively that Third College's 
outlook is solely responsible for this 
fact, but Martinez would " like to th ink 
so." 

Tom Hull summed up the situation 
when he said , "The real irony is that 
students are actually cheating 
themselves. "

Fern Volleyballers Ready 
The volleyball team is at it again and, sure enough, the girls 

are right in there pitching too. That's right! This year, why 
don 't you all go watch your favorite females in volleyball 
action, intercollegiate style, as the home season starts 
Wednesday, in the gym, at 7:30 p.m .. with no admission 
charge? 

The girls volleyball team has a very optimistic outlook this 
year, and with very good reason. Last Saturday the women 
spikers, (a popular , colloquial term for volleyball players ) took 
their first match from Palomar in two consecutive games, 15-
10, 15-10. The team was led by the spiking efforts of Merit 
Watson and Elaine Simay. They provide the "go" for the 
offense and will be back in action Wednesday. The team will 
not have the services of Carol Martindale. Probably the team's 
most valuable player, the setter pulled some ligaments in the 
Palomar game and will be lost for a couple of weeks. The rest 
of the starting lineup consists of Page ebraska, Oonna Hands, 
Sally Krenn, and Jeannie Ross, who will probably take Carol's 
place. 

Not the least of the attractions of the volleyball team. and 
probably two reasons why they are expected to do well , are the 
coaches, Chuck Millenbah and Jeff Gorrall . Jeff is a student 
who is volunteering his services (or the improvement of the 
females . Rumors have it that both of these coaches are very 
voca l during the games. and a treat to watch. 

Both coaches were impressed with the dedication and spirit 
of the girls team. The girls are at work every day. including 
Sundays. and this is one of the reasons why they will be 
contenders for the league title . Be there Wednesday to support 
the team. 

Kickers ~plit 
Last week UCSO's soccer 

team played Fresno Slate 
College and Fresno Pacific 
College, and emerged with a 
split. beating Pacific 3-0 and 
falling before Fresno State 2-1. 
This puts the Tritons ' sea on ' 
mark at 4-3 and their language 
record at 3-2. 

Against Pacifi c last 
Saturday, the booters started 
off a bit sluggishly but ended up 
with a 2-0 lead at halftime. 
Jorge Rivas scored both goals, 
one of which was a penalty 
kick. The final UCSD tally was 
fired into the nets by Bob Goe. 
The Triton defense played well , 
smothering the Pacific attack 
before it could do any damage. 

On Wednesday the Tritons 
made a great journey up to 

Fre no to take on the Fresno 
Slate Bulldogs, one of the 
strongest teams in the divisi!>n . 
The Bulldogs dominated the 
game from the opening kickoff 
as they fired barrage after 
barrage of shots at the UCSO 
goal. They finally broke 
through and scored in the 
second period, but minutes 
later Stewart Hayes blasted 
one in for the Tritons to even 
the score; the fatal goal came 
in the third quarter , and the 
Tritons were unable to come up 
with an equalizer. Fresno State 
took an incredible 40 shots on 
goal during the game. Triton 
goalkeeper Robert Van Valin 
played an outstanding game, 

. making over 30 saves as he held 
con· t p. 6.

Waterboys Take Two 
It was a record - breaking 

weekend for the Triton water 
. polo team, as they got back on 
the winning track at home with 
back - to - back victories over 
Claremont - Harvey Mudd, and 
Fresno State. Those of you who 
were around know that one of 
the records to fall was that of 
longevity. Friday's game 
lasted so long that the refs 
didn't even bother to go home 
( unfortunatel y) be for e 
Saturdays contest. Saturday's 
game was similar, to the point 
where Dean Shade. known as 
Lamp during his brighter 
moments (and who is the 
religious leader of the team) , 
complained of not being able to 
retire early enough to rise for

sunri e Sunday service. ext 
time these refs show up, 
everybody pack a lunch - at 
least that way you 'll have 
something to throw at them. 

The refs were pretty badly 
maligned in the last article. 
and I feel really bad about 
misrepresenting their ability , 
for it became clear this 
weekend tha t they were 
actually much worse than 
originally judged. Both games 
combined. there were 173 fouls 
whistled , with the record high

Fresno State. That works out to 
about a whistle every 24 
seconds, which to gi ve you a 
frame of reference is like 
calling a penalty about every 
other play in a football game. 
Rumor has it that the rest of 
UCSO's home games will be 
rated " X" if the players keep 
impeding each other all over 
the pool. The "no touchee, no 
foulee" jazz was again in strict 
enforcement, so that even 
Assistant Coach Gary Becker 
was awarded a black mark for 
patting the ref on the back. 

. (Are you sure it was the back , 
Gary? ) Though there was some 
small success in forci ng the 
refs to admit errors, there was 

~ __ .;.::r~ 
a definite communications gap. 
John O'Connell even tried sign 
language, but fortunately it 
wasn't seen ... 

To the dry facts : Friday 's 
game, highlighted by a 20-
minute delay. was one of those 
affairs where nobody led by

over. CHM tried everything.
