Editorial 

Council must prove 
it's worth $15,000 

Next year'S ASSOCiated 'tudent...; Couno! ha..; the 
potentiai to be an effective \'oice of the "tudent-.. 
ad\'ocating their right~ In a time increasIngly ho~1 i1f 
toward hIgher educat IOn. 

The fir t step toward undermining thIs po...,sibilit~ 
ha, already been taken. A President IIenr~ Chu has 
proposed in his 1982·83 executive budget that all A 
CouncIl members be given stipends totalling $15.000 
for the fiscal year. 

Chu' logic for in tituting ,tipends ,eems 
reasonable: at UCLA, Berkeley and Davis, stipend 
have been used to motivate student goyernment 
members to do a better job representIng students. 
With a steady income from Council work, hesays, the 
need to eek work that would take time away from 
tudent advocacy work is eliminated. 

But clearly, this is not UCLA, or Berkeley, or Davis. 
This is UCSD; we are younger and smaller than these 
other campu e , and the structure and direction of 
our student government has been traditionally 
somewhat different than the e other chool . 

And many Council members in recent years have 
performed their duties with all the dedication we 
would expect without Chu's proposed carrot·and· 
stick cherne. 

Before the AS can even discuss paying itself, we feel 
it must prove itself as a hard·working body on the 
students' behalf. We hope that the substantial block 
of Student Action Slate votes on the Council will go 
toward defeating Chu's recommendation for stipends 
and that they will immediately begin to set an 
example as individuals dedicated to the student 
interest, not to a monthly paycheck. 

Jules Bagneris tried unsuccessfully to allocate over 
$15,000 to a stipends budget not two weeks ago, and 
that proposal was overwhelmingly voted down by the 
previous council. Academic Affairs Commissioner 
Lee Anderson has already s ubmitted a counter· 
budget with no stipends proposal included.

Letter to the Editor 

An English viewpoint of the 
Falkland islands conflict 
Editor: 

Pablo (;hl'nl" (LL'lters, !\1a\' 
:n 1~~21. fl't'1s that Argl>ntlna 
has bt'en misrepre!iented In 
t he I r~ med ia over Its 
treatmem of the Falkland 
Islands' conflict. Hi s 
condemnation of the American 
media is mistaken, but in this 
reply it is more Important to go 
to the roots of hiS polemic 
which IS an apology for the 
Argentinian action. [ write as 
an Englishman both in 
opposit ion to t he Thatcher 
government and profoundly 
moved bv a distaste for the 
untruths· in Cheni. ' justifica· 
tion for his military junta. 

Against Chenis r would list 
the following points: 

- I would concede that the 
British colonised the 
Falklands in 1883 and indeed 
pressured to leave the (dozen 
or so) transitory inhabitants at 
that time. This historical 
legacy is of some weight and 
gives some - but only some-
credence to Argentine claims 
to island s that lie hundreds of 
miles off its hore. However, 
unlike other co lonial 
plantations (e.g. Ulster, India , 
Rhodesia - the British have a 
long record) the Falklands 
have never exploited an 
indigenou majority popula· 
tion. On the contrary , they 
have lived peacefully , eking 
out an existence, oppressing 
no one. Their survival and 
development of what is today's 

Falkland" is a major reason 
wh\' t he\ should be aIJowt'd to 
escape the clulches of 
Argentinian dictators. 

Moreover. since the 
Argeminians make much of 
their being t he original 
inhabitants (a highly 
quest ionable assumpt ion) one 
might care to recall that 
readers of this letter In the 
main can trace roots back little 
more than a century. Indeed, 
we are al1 ultimately 
"planted," British from 
Roman. French, Scandina· 
vian; Argentinians from 
Italian and Spanish ...... The 
crucial point in the current 
crisis is that the Falklanders 
arrived and have never hurt 
anyone. There \\ a scarcely 
anyone there on their arrival 
(and no permanent peoples ) 
and they have lived peaceably 
since. 

- It is true, as Ghenis notes 
but then willfully miscon· 
s trues, that the British have 
been trying to divest 
them elves of the Falklands 
for ome years. Part of this 
process was the introduction 
of conditions applicable to 
Falklanders ' rights to UK 
passports . The British have 
encouraged Argentinian links 
with the Falkland in recent 
years with the clear intention 
of sovereignty being transmit· 
ted to the Latin American 
nat ion. On any reckoning the 
British have been wanting to 

get thest I~(j() people (d their 
hand", 

- 110\\ eVt'r, crucial to the 
Brit Ish (and surel\' to an\' 
democrat), has been the right 
of a people to self·determina· 
tion. And. as thev themselves 
have made abundanth' clear. 
the Falklanders do not \ .. 'ant to 
be governed by one of the most 
murderous dictator hip:. in 
the world. The British have, 
albeit reluctantly, accepted 
this position. 

- It is this principle and 
democratic right that the 
Argentinian junta has 
stamped upon in its aggression 
and Chenis simply lies in 
'uggesting that the military 
would give the islanders 
democratic rights which it 
barbarously resists at home. 

- The Argentinian invasion 
was to impo e by force their 
rule on a peaceful communi ty. 
For this reason the UN 
immediately condemned the 
invasion. Britain has - for 
democratic reasons - an 
obligation to help these people 
resi t a military regime and 
allow them to live a life that 
they choose. It is on this issue 
that the Argentinian junta has 
steadfastly refused to move 
(but what could democracy 
mean to the thugs and 
murderers who occupy leading 
roles in the Argentine 
government?). It is for thi 
reason that the British have

Senate considers cOfllplicated state budget 

Figures based on average cost of educating university students 
By HANK SCH LMAN 

Sacramento Correspondent 
The second round in the 

proce. s of adopting a state 
budget for the fi cal year 
beginning July 1 began with a 
flurry of legislative committee 
hearings last week. and a 
motion to establish a fee 
struction for the University of 
California. 

UC fee would be set at 40-50 
percent of a complicated base 
figure roughly represent ing 
the average cost of educating 
university students. The base 
next year would be $3.000, so 
fees could be placed between 
$1,200-$1.500. 

At the first Senate Finance 
Committee hearing set aside to 
discus s Gov . Brown's 
proposed budget , Sen. Ken 

Maddy (R-Fresno) moved 
approval last week of the 
formula, suggested by the 
California Postsecondary 
Education Commission 
(CPEC). 

Maddy further moved that 
UC fees be raised to $1.150 for 
the next academic year, a 
figure lower than both Gov . 
Brown and CPEC recom-
mended _ Maddy later said he 
erred and would revise his 
motion seeking instead a 
$1,200 fee. 

The powerful I5·member 
finance committee reserved 
any action on the budget until 
all five budget subcommittees 
reported their final recom-
mendations last week, which 
were ironed out during dozens 
of hearings over the past two-

and·a·half months. 
The education subcommit-

tee approved $3 million worth 
of cuts from the UC's $1.15 
billion general fund budget 
proposal, a reduction with 
which UC budget specialist 
William Haker said the 
University would be "abso-
lutely sat isfied ." 

Recent plummeting revenue 
projections have prompted 
talk of further reduct ions, 
however. and Baker said the 
chances were "slim and none" 
that the final budget will 
reflect the subcommittee's 
recommendat ion. 

Baker made his remarks 
before last week's hearing, the 
fir t of several the finance 
committee will hold this week 
prior to voting on its final 

PEN awards Schillers for 
article in 'Nation' tnagazine 

By SCOTT YOUNG 
Anita Schiller, research 

bibliographer at Central 
library, and her husband 
Herbert Schiller, professor in 
the communications depart-
ment-elect , received an award 
Friday night from PEN, a 
prestigious literary club. 

The Schillers, both of whom 
specialize in the study of 
information and mass 
commnications, received first 
prize for an article which 
appeared in The Nation, April 
17, 1982, entitled, "The 
Privatizing Of Information: 
Who Can Own What America 
Knows?" 

PEN, an organization with 
86 international chapters, 
sponsors awards for most 
aspects of literature. Its 
primary focLis in the past has 
been on fiction, novels, storie, 
drama and poetry . However, 
this year' ceremony of the 
CalJfornia PEN also included 
award for jou rnalism, 

newspaper articles, magazine 
journalism, television and 
radio s hows and a film 
documentray. 

The Schillers were awarded 
golden pens in the magazine 
article category for the 1981-82 
year ending April 30. "The 
whole thing happened very 
fast...we came in practically 
ten days before the year was 
out so for us it was totally 
unexpected," Herb Schiller 
commented. 

Anita Schiller also described 
the award as a surprise. "I 
hadn 't the faintest idea we 
would get it ... the PEN club 
l"'()ks at both what is said in 
terms of the expression of 
ideas and so forth , but also at 
the writing, since it is a 
literary c1u b .. .! thought it (the 
article ) had omething 
important to ay." 

Her husband added, "[t

really serious exchanges .. . It '

with puffery and PR (public 
relations), and all that kind of 
stuff, but a full, old·fashioned 
look at things as they rC;<llly 
are ... they generally are an 
organization trying to defend 
the open expression of ideas." 

The Schillers' article dealt 
with a similar issue open 
access for the public to the 
large body of information 
generated by the United States 
government. Such things as 
"census data, Congressional 
hearings and reports. 
consultants'research, 
departmental studies" fall into 
this category, as well as 
pamphlets and brochures 
dealing with everything from 
plumbing and sanitation to 
solar power, health. welfare 
benefits and agriculture.

which will be presented to the 
full enate. That vote WIll 
most likely occur this week 

Last week' hearing was 
devoted mostly to di cus IOn 
on the fee formula, which 
spawned disagreement among 
committee members 

Sen. Walter Stiern CD-
Bakersfield), chair of the 
education subcommittee. 
defended the playas neees ary 
to help offset budge t 
reductions and to eliminate ad 
hoc fee increa es. 

" The subcommittee was 
unanimous in its decision to 
raise these fees," Stlern said in 
his opening remarks to the 
committee, ''This consen~us 
did not occur casually or 
easily . The subcommittee 
spent several lengthy heanngs 
on this issue, and moved from 
an initial position of opposition 
to one of reluctant acceptance. 

" Were it not for the 
compelling evidence (about the 
need for a fee structure) 
contained in the Postse· 
condary Education Commis-
sion report and the severity of 
the state's economiccondition. 
the outcome of this item may 
have ben quite different. " 

On the other hand, Sen. jim 
Nielsen criticized the UC's 
ability to raise fees whenever 
it faces fiscal trou bles, and 
instead called for University 
belt-tightening. 

"Serving on t his (education) 

subcommltte(' last ~ear I 
became very concerned that m 
government we tr,- to 
prioritIze. but It ~eems the 

niverslty ~cape:. prioritlz-
mg by mcreasing fees and

are." sa id Niel~en , a 
Repu blican from Woodland 

Sen. Alan Sierotv (D-Lo:-, 
Angeles ) questi oned the 
propriety of adopting such an 
important formula without a 
heanng In a policy committee 
- that It should not be part of 
the budget. 

Finance Committee Chair 
Alfred Alquist (D an Jose) 
dIsagreed. saYll1g after the 
hearing. "that subject has 
been dls cus~ed 111 policy 
committees over and over it 
again. " 

Two more finance commit-
tee hearings were ~cheduled 
last week to discu s the 
University's , III tructlOn and 
physical Improvement budget 

The UC system faces a $40 
million loss in these capital 
outlay funds because of a 
decline in the oil revenues set 
aside to bankroll them.

tee refused to discuss t he 
capital outlay budget at a

From a Staff Writer 
ASUCSO president Henry 

Chu presented the council 
with the 1982-83 budget . but 
was confronted with a counter 
budget proposed by Commis-
sioner of Academic Affairs. 
Lee Anderson. 

Differences between the two 
budgets centered around 
Committee for World 
Democracy (CWO) funding. 
and a stipends proposal - two 
issues which have received 
much attention in the past 
year 's council. 

Chu's budget . which was 
prepared in conjun ct ion with 

Vice President Kim Piontkow-
sk i. alloca ted nearly $16.000 of 
the budget to go toward a 
sti pe nd program . The 
proposa l . however , wa -
opposed by Anderson's budget 
in which no stipend proposal 
was included. 

A st ipend s propo sa l , 
su bmitted to the previous 
council by Jules Bagneris, was 
voted down 2-12-3 two weeks 
ago. 

Anderson 's budget al so 
gave $12,500 for the CWO' 
him series. a proposal which 
wou ld fund CWO at present 
levels. Chu's budget. however. 

makes no allocat ions toward 
the film series. He instead 
wanted CWO to receI ve 
fundin g as a s t udent 
organization, a proposal which 
some fear will harm the film 
series. 

As a rea on fo r the 
recla s ificati on of CWO 
funding, Chu stated that the 
CWO is an organization with 
"pol itical implications." and 
therefore it hould be funded 
as a student organization . 

"It 's a good program. but I 
don't feel it deserves such a 
large amount " of the budget, 
Chu added.

Deciphering vitatnin labels 
In the \'it amin !I1dul-t r~', all pi "duct label s nU-,1

The product in t he bottle can only be pr(':-Ol'nl as 
liqUid, I)(m del', cr~ stalline po\\'dn, hard·shell 
capsule, soft gelatlll capsule or compressed tablet. 
"C apsulr,," will ident Ify elt her of t \\ 0 dosage forms 
One type of capsule is the hard shell (pull apart) 
capsule. The other form of capsule would be the 
molded sofl grlalln capsule\\'hich is most frequently 
used to carr~ oil based supplement s such as Vitamm 
E. Vitamin A, Vitamin D and occasionally mlllt iple 
\ ' J! am!l1s. 

The Side panel is the area of the label where a 
consumer can be easily mIsled or can easily 
misunderstand what is presented, Here IS what to 
look for and to look out for when reading these 
labels: 

Formula statement, Potency formulas may 
often be contained in more than one tablet or 
capsule, Il is important to understand how many 
tablet or capsu les are required to achieve the full 
potency a presented on the label. 

Parenthesis and elemental statements, Of 
the following. 

A, Zinc amino acid chelate, . , , ... , , " 100 mg, 
B, Zinc (amino acid chelate). , , , .... , , 100 O1g. 
C, Zinc (elemental/from amino acids chelate) ... 
, , , , , , . , , . , , , , , , , , . , , , , . , , , , ... , , , .. , ] 00 mg. 
0, Zinc (from amino acid chelate) "," 100 mg, 

"B." "C," and "0" all describe tablets which upply 
100 mg, of elemental zinc. the source being amino 
acid chelated zinc. "A" describes a tablet which 
supplied on ly about 10·15 mg, of elemental zinc from 
100 mg. of amino acid chelate, 

The key to reading potency statement lies in I he 
presence or ab ence of parenthe es. If the name of

An LU. is a measured effect dosage, meanmg that 
the dosage is measured by the reactIOn a certam 
amount of the vitamin has on the body. Thl~ 
internat ionally accepted measurement differs 
between all vitamins. So. 400 I.U.'s of Vitamin E i~ 
not equal to 400 I.U.' of Vitamin A, for example. 

Directions, A a rule of thumb. all supplements 
should be taken with food. preferably a balanced 
diet. The vllamins, therefore, are able to combine

Ingredients. The ingredients section of the label

scrutiny is required to take note of additional 
ingredients of smaller quantities mentioned 
following the list of vitamin, Special attention 
should be paid to terms that possibly disguise less 
desirable ingredients. For example. flavorings and

Braff and hi" co·authur. Denms P ,accu7.7O, 
Ph,D" professor of psychulogy at an Dleg( tate 
['ni\,ersity, tested 16 medIcation free SchizophreniC 
pallents, 20 medicated schizophreniC patIent. and 
20 depressl\'e patients with major or minur 
depreSSIve disorders, They v,'ere all tested using a 
technlqu,'! called backward masking, 

In theory. IllformatlOn passel- through various 
stages before it b con~Clously stored In the brain . 
Fir t, a stimulus enter iconic memory, a temPOran' 
holding area where the Information IS stored for a 
matter of milliseconds . At Ihls point the 
information is highly vulnerable and I~ ea 'Jly 10sl , 
since the informatIOn is not yet consclOu ... lv 
recognized by t he brain. The cnllcal step IS when the 
information, or stimulu . pa ses to thehort·term 
memory , and becomes part of t he brain' con~ciou s 
memory bank. 

Using tests which follow one \Isual stimulus With 
another stImulus. the speed at whIch the origmal 
stimulus passes to shon·term memory can betimed, 

For example, a \Isual target stImulus, such as a 
letter, IS presented A second stimulus, called a 
mask, IS then pre~ented The Interval of time 
between t he present atlon of the I arget and the mask 
IS decrrased, and at some point. the subject will 
report 'ieeing only I hr mask, and not the target. The 
number of milliseconds that elapse 1)(,lw('('n Ihe

The Clash enter 'Cotnbat' But then there is a limit to how political you can be on record and still have it come 
across as sincere. As The 
Clash becomes a progress ively 
bigger commercial succe s, 
one has to question the actual 
intent of such hem'Y IXllit ical 
overtones. The Clash is now a 
serious commerCIal entIty 
that sells millions of records 
and selb out huge hall" like 
Van Iialm (to lx' rude but to 
the poInl), and I he pn mar) 
\'eh Iele for I heir message IS a

diffIcult to accept a messagt'

dance in 
concert 
7th annual show 
is a great success 

By LINDA COLLEY 
and VALERIE McMULLIN 
Saturday night in the 

Mandeville Auditorium the 
audience was kept waiting in 
anticipation of the 7th Annual 
UCSD Dance Concert, an 
event presented by students 
here under the direction of 
Margaret Marshall. 

The curtain rose 15 minutes 
late with a rather shaky 
opening number entitled 
"J)ivertissments." The 
performer,,' nervousne s was 
apparent, however stage fnght 
quickly disappeared with the 
subsequent piece, "Life 
During Wartime," a stunning 
solo effort by Sharon Terris. 
This li'Cly modern jazz piece 
dazzled t he audience With high 
jump!; and well choreographed 
movements. 

Margaret Marshall's troops warm up for their performance, 

Thre duo" danced and all 
were impressi\'e, the most 
striking being "Pas de deux" 
from Cia sical Variation..; . 
This ballet piece, done on 
pointe, was sharp and well 
rehearsed. Paul Maraga} wa" 
feat ured in the ot her two 
performances with Mike 
Galang and Valerie harpe. 

Several types of dance were 
offered other than the 
traditional ballet. jazz and tap. 
"Spirit of the Drum" was a 
refreshing pIece which 

1Jl\'ol\'ed int ranced dan cers 
movlI1g 10 the savage beat of a 
bongo played onstage by Omar 
Moore. 

"Mannequll1," b~ Katharine 
Moe, was a dehghtful comIc 
skit. It, along with "Danny's 
All Star Joinl." a parodyofThe 
Jazz L nllmited Dance 
Com pany, provided humor 
\\ith exquisite style and 
choreography. 

One could tell that a lot of 
preparation went into the 
making of "Chicken Reel." 
The stage was decorated with 
appropriate country relics and 

the dancers costumes were 
colorful. The men's solo was 
the highlight of this It\'ely 
\vestern square dance. 

The event ended wit h a 
strong performance of .. !\tan~ 
Roads," choreographed b) 
PatricIa Rincon, a dance 
Instructor at l C D and 
founder of The Jazz Unhmlled 
Dance Compan}. Howe"er the 
audience w as left wit hout a 
final bow from the ent ire cast 
to culminate the evening. This 
is unfortunate because all 
deserved another round of 
applause.

The company believe that , 

" Miller's text is an ideal 
vehicle for the kind of 
ensemble performance work 
central to the con cept of 
Femini t Theatre. One of the 
dominant motifs of Feminis t 
Theatre companie both here

att e mpt t o r es i s t th e 
tendencies toward hierarchy 
and pecialization ty pical in 
mu ch modern comm ercial

play i of particular value 
becau e it examines both male 
and female roles in American 
society with empathy for the 
difficulties for both sexes in 
defining roles and di tributing 
powers. 

Cross Counlry will be 
performed at UCSD' Warren 
Theatre. Performance times

"Da n was p lace d on 
probation. He felt he couldn 't 
continue to work u nder t hose 
conditions," \\ eet said. 

"Dan and I have discussed 
it. It is a personnel matter and 
I don't wish to make it pu blic." 

Monteverde would say only 
hIS departure wac., "due to 
some personal conflicts of 

opinion wi t h Judy Sweet."

back on Its butt for a ~ hile. 
The players who arc plannmg

abou t it." 

Da\ ic., ,aid the players were 
thinking about returning to 

the team but were not looking 
forwa rd to it. 

Va larie H ardie ca ll ed 
Monteverde "a good coach . He

Volley ball coach \\Till stress teanl unity 
By ELANA ROSEN 

Stall Wriler 
Because the incredible 

nucleus of women who won 
the national championship in 
volleyball la t year is 
returning, recruiting will play 
a very minor role in the team's 
future. 

will be directed strictly toward 
the playing aspect , rat her than 
the recruiting aspect of the 
sport. 

Presently. Dannevik's only 
worry concerning recruiting is 
that he expect five or SIX 
incoming freshmen. and with 
only a certain number of 
po itions on the court, some 
player will not make the 
team. With 13 out of 14 start-

ers ret urn 109. Dannevik doe 
not forsee many openings, and 
he feel s it is an "injustice" 
to have bodies just sitting on 
the bench. 

Dannevik expres ed 
nothing but positive words as 
he spoke of a new philo ophy 

for I his young. powerful team. 
that is: tostan a tradition With 
these women. 

Becau e of the fact that all 
but one of the women played 
together this year. a 
coheSiveness and unity that is 

please turn to page 18 

Unlike past year in which 
coaches have spent time and 
energy to capture tudents 
who are not merely volleyball 

pla~'ers but whose academic 
s tandings fulfill UCSD's 
requirements. this year's 
recruiting will differ. 

With the exception of senior 
Marilyn Horn, who will be 
transferring to UC Irvine. the 
complete women 's volleyball 
team will havetheopportunity 
to tighten their already tight 
team. 

Dannevik's only "recruit " 
will be Elaine Bergman , 
previou ly an all-American 
player at UCSD. Academic 
demands prevented her from 
playing la t year, but he will 
return a a great asset to the 
team. 

Men's V-ball is questionable 

This year. coach Doug 
Dannevik's time and energy 

Falletta comments 
continued from page 15 
brought up the e concerns, but said simply , "Dall and I 
have discussed it. It is a personnel matter and I don 't wish 
to m;:oke it public information." 

He was placed Oil probation for an unspecified period of 
time; he felt he couldn't continue to work under those 
conditions. Period. End of story. 

Monteverde would not go into the remarks Sweet made 
to him at their meeting, stating simply. "It's over. I'm 
gone." Belaboring the issue in the paper would only serve to 
stir up animosities and hard feelings and would accomplish 
nothing. 

Next season'scoach is going to have some big shoes tofill. 
And, whatever her reasons, Sweet and the soft ball program 
are both going to have to live with her decision . 

She cannot change history, however. The Triton 
women's softball team will be long remembered for Dan 
Monteverde, Jill Keane. Vanessa Davis, Leigh Ann Layton, 
Jan Martin, Julie Spatafore, Karen White, Cece Chisholm, 
Val Hardie, Kathy Clasby, jayne Cottrell. Epo Rossiter. and 
the gallery of regulars who cheered their spirit and heart in 
the windy, clumpy field of Warren in 1982.

lafl Wriler 

Unfortunately, recruiting 
for the men's volleyball team 
will not be as simple or as 
mooth as that for the 

women' team. The men are 
losing their central core. with 
eight of 12 starting players 
departing from UCSD. Seven 
team member are graduating 
and one is leaving for academic 
reasons . 

Coach Doug Dannevik 's 
tone. while discussing 
recruiting. was a bit 
pessimistic. He explained that 
the majority of the high school 
volleyball players are unaware 
of their academic situation 
with respect to college 
requirements. Their concerns 
are generally focussed upon 
just "playing ball" and they 
are not aware of the 
university's demands until it 
is too late. 

Dannevik stated that most 
of the talented players are 
either "beach-surfer type 
guys" or the opposite extreme. 
excellent students as well as 
skilled volleyball players. For 
the latter player. schools such 
as UCLA and Stanford which 

offer academic or athletic 
scholarships are much more 
inviting. 

Although slightly frustrated 
(nine out of ten of his potential 
recru it s are presently 
ineligible for UCSD). 
Dannevik is rounding up 
transcripts, observing high 
school competitions and 
mentioned that he is waiting 
for the schools offering 
scholarships to "take their 
pick " before he can fully 

rebuild the team for the 
upcoming season. 

Players returning next year 
are freshmen Brian Ness im 
and Dave Halgren, sophomore 
Kevin Bateman and junior Jim 
Bishop. Two players, Dan 
Gutfinger, a junior transfer 
student from UC Irvine, and 
Anthony Monaghan, a 6'4" 
middle blocker from New 
York. will bejoiningthemen's 
team along with a field of new 
players next season. 

Softball recruiting 
continued from page 15 
shortstop for the last three 
years at Carlsbad High School. 
Monteverde says that she is 
fast. has a Quick glove and an 
"uncanny understanding of 
the sport." 

Nicole is a bright student. 
which will help also. he says. 

Puhr was all-regional. all-
league Division II, first team 
center fielder during Cal State 
Sacramento's winning season 
last year. She was one of their 
leading hitters, pacing them to 
the nat ional championships, 
Monteverde says. 

Williamson won the 
honorable mention all-league 
for Palomar College this year, 
even though she was hurt and 
played ony half the season. 

Dolan was Vista's lead·off 
hitter and led that team in 
stolen bases. 

Monteverde says he plans to 
contact these women again 
and hopes they will attend 
UCSD and play softball. 
though he won t be back in '83. 
Scholastically and athletic· 
a ll y, UC S D h as high 
standards, he says.

Basketball coaches recruit w-ithout benefits 
continued from pal'fC 15 
eight without money to wheel 
and deal? 

"We can offer two important 
things," A sistant Coach 
Marshall said. "Fir, t, a great 
education for tho e who want 
it. and second, John Block. He 
can tell a kid right off the bat 
whet her he has a hot at going 
pro and if not. how to work 
until he does." 

EVIdently, Block, a t en·year 
veteran, has a lot to offer. 
Beside B anales, Dave 
McGuire, a seven-foot transfer 

Volleyball 
continued fro m page 16 

from BYU is coming here next 
fall. He is transferring for the 
educational opportunitie and 
the coaching sk ills Block has 
to offer. 

Other hopeful recruits 
Include Derek Dodge, a 
forward from 100rpark J.C., 
Brandon NIxon, an off·guard 
from cotlsdale City College, 
Arizona. and Ron Hicks, a 
forward from Palomar J. . 
Returnmg from last year are 
Bob Goodman, MIke Dabasin· 
skas, Mike Barreca, and 
others. 

Now for the women. 
Coach Judy Malone has the 

same recruiting problem that 
the men's coaches have but 

agrees that she has a slight 
advantage - the San Diego 
high school girl ' ba ket ball 
. eason ends later than most. 
ThIS mean. that big colleges 
ha\'e already established their 
recruits while forgetting about 
the talent In the ~an Diego 
area. That leaves Malone wit h 

~omc pretty good ballplayers 
and not much competition. 

Malone needed to fill the 
center and forward po 'it ions 
because of her graduating 
~niors, Mary Egan, Stacey 
McFayden and Jill Keane. 
Malone found center Teik 
Francis, a 6'3" Mira Mesa 
High School graduate, and 
Shelley McKeone, 6'1' from 
University Hil{h, to fill Mary 

Egan's huge shoes. 
Also from University High is 

5'5" Helen Douglas, who hope 
to fill t he vacancy left by 
graduating guard, Wend y 
Freed. Malone said "Helen is 
going to work out well and 
take over where Wendy left. 
She's probably faster than 
Wendy and works just as hard. 
In I he summer, she' ll work out 
""Ith Paulette (Parker) and 
step nght in for Wendy." 

Possible recruits from Biola 
and Sha ta College are 5'9" 
forward Julie Krause, and 5'8" 
Sue Spence. The squad carries 
12 or 13 players and is 
ret urning eight, three of them 
starters. 

Malone's contacts for 

recruits range form Nort hern 
California to the Bay Area and 
San Diego. "Most players are 
excited to find out that a 
college coach is watching them 
or asking about their stats," 
Malone said. 

The women's season for '82-
'83 has been toned down a 
little. La:;t year, they played 
numerou~ Di\'i~ion I teams but 
this Year, they will ~llck to 
teams of their own caliber.

of primary importance to a 

trong, balanced team is his 
goal for the coming year. 

Dannevik feels that it is 
time to establish more than a 
"perfecting of skills" attitude, 
and that it is time that "loyalty 
should be tarted," that one 
could continue through his 
college career.

is anxious to fi ll out next

predicts.

Dannevik, provides an 
attractive aspect that most 
volleyball teams can't offer. He 
believes t hal developing that 
"secu rity is the key to 
improving a team that is 
already outstanding." 

From Los Angeles comes a 
fre hman third baseman who 
will undoubtedly compete 
with Jay Sierzchula and Dave 
Jankowski for the starting 
role. 

For his returning athletes, 
Yates even drew up lists 
itemizing each player's 
personal problem s to be 
worked on during the off-
season . 

He co mmented that
