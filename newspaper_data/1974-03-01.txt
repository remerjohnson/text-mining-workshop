Hoffman stated that to 
his knowledge th is is the 
first collision of this sort

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO Friday, March 1, 1974 

What Brought QM to Cantpus 
by Jerry Schneider 

"This is a Quinn-Martin production. We are asking for 
your cooperation in the production of, The Cham-
pions ." Sign at Revelle Cafeteria, Tuesday . 

Quinn-Martin Productions, a Hollywood television 
company, left the UCSD campus Wednesday, as quickly 
as they came. 

But during its three day stay here, its crew member 
and equipment had a unique effect on the campus 
community. 

The first large sca le production filmed here in at least 
four years was met by large groups of curious and 
inquisitive onlookers at each of its seven locations, 
centered primarily on the Revelle campus. On several 
occasions, director Harvey Hart cou ld not clear the set 
of students. Although Actor's Guild Contracts call only 
for paid union employes to be used as extras (a number 
of "college students" were brought from Hollywood), he 

allowed a large number of students to fdl In the 
background . 

Actors and producers were more than obliging In 
answering students' questions. One Q-M spokesman 
attributed this to the higher level of intelligence found 
on a college campus compared to on-the-street 
locations . 

Despite a single incident in the Revelle Plaza, 
Monday, when several students momentarily halted 
filming by obstructing ca meras, the overall response to 
the company on campus, based on student comments, 
was hospitable, if not encouraging. 

Dick Gallegly, production manager and a ten-year 
veteran at Q-M, said that he chose UCSD because It 
filled the role of a southwestern university (the 
University of San Leone in the film) . The script also calls 
for hospital scenes and shots by the ocean . After first 
sampling the UC Santa Barbara campus and surrounding 
area, he decided on La Jolla where all locations were 
close together. 

Two weeks ago, Q-M contacted Patricia Greene, 
administrative assistant of public affairs, to make 
arangement for its coterie of crew and cameras Cy 
Greaves, manager of the office of public affairs, 
outlined the terms of the contract . For $250 a day, for 
three days ($750 total), Q-M cou ld film on campus 
They could not "disturb classes or disrupt any campus 
activity." The film also could not make reference to the 
University of California . 

Greaves also stated that the contract "primarily 
protected the University from liability in case of 
damages to studio employees or their equipment II 
Greene, as campus representative, accompanied the 
Hollywood-based group to each location .

Monday to complete 13 days of filming Crews work

M.J. Drive: 
Apparent Failure 

by John Taylor 
The state-wide marijuana initiative, which ended on 

Monday with the submitting of petitions to county 
registrars , appears to have failed, the drive's San Diego 
county coordinator has said. 

Spencer Wold, speaking to the San Diego Union 
Tuesday, said that though 375,000 sigrtatures were 
submitted from all over California (50,000 more that the 
required number), a "quite high" percentage of the 
signatures are proving to be invalid. 

Only individuals who registered and voted in the last 
election, or who have registered since that election, 
were eligible to sign the petitions. 

Wold said that a similar initiative in 1972 produced a 
30 percent rate of invalid signatures . A comparable 
percentage would result in failure to qualify the 
initiative, which would have removed criminal penalties 
for the possession of marijuana for private use, to 
appear on the November ballot. 

Less than half of the required signatGres had been 
gathered by the beginning of February. "We just ran out 
of time," Wold said . 

Melvyn Douglas, long time screen and teleVision 
actor, portrays Dr. Paul Harle on, who performs 
euthanasia on his wife (Mildred Dunnock), dying of 
terminal cancer of the brain . Harleson goes on trial for 
murder, defended by a father-son team of lawyers, 
Amos Champion (Denver Pyle) and his son, Sam 
(Bradford Dillman) . 

Gallegly, who also engineered the production of the 
F.B.I. for eight years, prior to his present assignment 
with The Streets of San Francisco, stated that the 
campus surroundings are needed because Dr . Harleson 
and his wife , also a doctor, are both college professors. 
The abundance of youthful energy on campus draws a 
direct contact to the aging, despairing doctor, he added . 

Q-M cameras filmed at the athletic field adjacent to 
the gymnasium Revelle Plaza and cafeteria , in front of 
Argo Hall and outside the second floor of the 
Humanities Library building. 

Television crewman also converted two rooms in 
Argo into medical offices . The four residents of the two 
rooms made an agreement with Q-M two weeks ago to 
be paid $50 each for the use of their room . In addition 
the four students received $25 each for moving their 
property in and out of their rooms . 

Greaves stated that the $250 per day fee is based 
relatively on that charged by UCLA : $1000 a day The 
$750 received from Q-M will be divided equally bet-
ween the public affairs office and the Revelle Provost's

Also on the committee 
are two university staff

area covered by the current 
university master plan; a 
graduate student, leik

UCSD staff members, 
Assistant Chancellor David

consider four areas ; 
transportation problems, 
the development of housing 
around the campus, the 
proposed University Town 
Center in the area im-
mediately east of the 
campus, and The Villa La 
Jolla development under 
construction south of the 
campus. 

He said the task forces 
and the open forum are the 
first steps in developing a 
continuously evolving 
University stance with 
respect to community 
development around the 
campus. It is anticipated 
that a broadened University 
perspective will emerge 
that can provide leadership 
for community develop-
ment, Grobstein said

You're Under Arrest 
Could you be fined 500 dollars and sentenced to 

spend the next six months of your life in the San Diego 
Jail? Statistics show that the vast majority of students on 
this campus are'violating the state laws making it illegal 
fol' any person under the age of 21 to buy, sell, or 
possess alcoholic beverages. If you have ever held a can 
of beer in your hand, or considered purchasing a bottle 
of wine in the State of California, you should read this 
article. I 

In 1971 the State Legislature changed the age of 
majority from 21 to 18. But they specifically excluded 
the freedom to consume alcohol from the list of rights 

~uaranteed to the new adults. At the time the legislators 
legislators felt that if young people were permitted to 
drink there would be an increase in the yearly traffic 
toll . In 1974 we can look back on four years of ex-
perience in seven states and see that those fears were 
totally without basis . 

Reports from across the country say that there are 110 
more 18-year-olds drinking and driving now than there 
were in the years before they were allowed to drink . The 
explanation offered by Sgt. Jerry Hendricks, of the San 
Diego City Police Department, is that "Most were dOing 
it illegally before the law changed, and that it therefore 
hasn't made much difference." 

But in California the inequities of the drinking law 
persist. So the Full Rights In itiative Committee is 
sponsoring a petition to place the question of equal 
rights on the June ballot. The Undergraduate Student 
Council has endorsed the proposition . And the San 
Diego Student Lobby Annex is spear-heading the local 
petition drive. If you are concerned about protecting 
your rights , and the rights of others, please help us 
collect signatures for the petition. Leave your name for 
Daryl Fanberg at 250MC (X2943) or in the Muir Dean 's 
Office and we will get the petitions to you . 

TUSL to Bring Bus 
A bright outlook for non-resident U.C.S.D. students 

arose from Monday evening's TUSC meeting. (The 
Â·Undergraduate Student Council) The Task Force, 
headed up by Mark Overgaard, announced a possible 
new bus service between Clairmont and University City 
hopefully beginning with the start of Spring Quarter. 
There will also be a possibility of a new east and south 
Pacific Beach , OGean Beach route as well. 

Lee Burke, Scott Thayer, and Tim Imbrie are 
representing the U.C.S.D . Student Lobby Annex at the 
Collective Bargaining Conference in Davis today. 
Anyone interested in knowing the outcome, contact Lee 
at X2943 

If you are interested in improving Administration -
Student relations, TUSC is sponsoring a Contact 
committee to look into the methods for improving such 
relations. For info contact Don Murphy at 452-8684 or 
Steph Harris at x2943. 

TUSC is presently in the process of reviewing its 
Budget Allocation procedures. All new and old Student 
Activities, Programs, and Organizations are required to 
submit a budgef request . The deadline is March 15, 
1974. Remember :0 turn them into "TUSC Allocations --

Clairemont -OeB. Bus Line Proposed 
A proposal to begin a UCSD Bus line to Clairemont 

and Ocean Beach has been submitted to the Business 
office. This bus service, if approved, would begin 
serving students, faculty and staff in these areas within a 
few weeks. 

This proposal was written by a student Task Force on 
Transportation, which was set up by the Undergraduate 
Student Council (T.U.S.C.) and the Graduate Student 
Council. This is the first step in a comprehensive plan to 
improve the transportation situation at UCSD. 

Due to the gas shortage and related problems, the 
Task force began by considering a UCSD bus line to 
serve the Clairemont and University City area. Without 
direct bus routes to campus, individuals in this area 
must now spend from 2 to 3 hours if they wish to take 
the city transit service. 

The second area which will be served is the Ocean 
Beach area. Since over 1,000 students and staff live 
here, a bus route would have a good chance to succeed. 
Though the Coast Cruiser is now operating in North 
County, the Task force proposal suggested perhaps a 
third route in the future to further serve this area . 

This Bus Line would be operated by' a registered 
student organization , which would be formed for this 
purpose. It would initially lease 2 buses from the Aztec 
Bus Company. Each bus would make seven, 25Tmile 
round tr ips per day. 

A part time business manager would be hired to take

Pharoah sat on his throne as cooling waves of Niagra 

Cyelo-.Massage rippled up and down his somewhat 
Egyptian back. His bald son, Abu Ben-Cay, and Akenbak 
the general were taking tul'hs telling him of the birth of 
the deliverer of the Hebrew slaves in the land of Mogen . 

" ... and this star is said by the slaves to signal the birth 
of the deliverer." 

"Which star is this," asked Pharoah , " to deliver this 
message?" 

"A new star, your Pharosity . It is ca lled Kohoutek," 
Akenbak replied . 

"My father," Ben-Gay interposed, " let us senselessly 
kill every new born Hebrew male child . In this way the 
threat will be rendered meaningless." 

" So be it ," Pharoah decreed, "and on the way back 
pick up a couple of six-packs." And Ben-Gay and 
Akenbak rose to do Pharoah's bidding . 

" By the way, what is this deliverer's name?" 
"We know him only by his title," Ben-Gay replied, 

" 'Pizza Manl," 
"Pizza Man?" asked Pharoah . 
" Yes," Akenbak answered . " 'He delivers'." 
"Oh ." 

'" '" "* â€¢ â€¢ I\' * 

The news of the impending massacre spread through 
the suburb of Mogen like a flame that did not consume. 
Mrs. Moses sat in her easy chair knitting a pair of 
eyebrows for her new unnamed child . Her daughter 
came bursting through the door . 

"Mommy, Mommy - I only had one!" 
"One what, Miriam?" 
"One whip scar," Miriam said. 
Mrs . Moses smiled benevolently and picked at the 

scab. " It must be the Crest." 
"And another hot little item, Mommy. The Egyptians 

are killing all the newborn Hebrew boys ." 
Mrs . Moses' hand flew to her mouth in horror. "Oh, 

Jesu !" she cried . 
"You've been skipping ahead again, Mommy," 

Miriam said reprovin gly. 
Mo es, Senior grabbed Miriam by the houlders. 

"What will we do?" she pleaddd 
" I'll look in the book," Miriam sugge ted . A few 

moments later she had the answer. "We'll put him in a 
boat made out of clarinet reeds and ship him south for 
the winter ." -

All the music tore in Mogen were oon old out of 
reeds and little baby Moses was on his way to MemphiS, 
Atlanta, and Miami . 

Mrs . Moses watched as Miriam set the boat adrift. A 
tear crawled down her cheek . Yet the trace of a smile I it 
her face as an idea h it her. 

"Miriam, follow the raft ." 
"Why, Mommy?" 
"Maybe we can resell the reeds ." 

So it was that Moses drifted into the bathtub of the 
Phari na, Helen of Troy. The next day, Roto-Rooter paid 
a call. The Pharina took him and gave him to the chief 
ring scrubber to nurse him for her . Mo es was given the 
advantage of an education, franking priveleges, and a 
Pharoah to call his very own . 

Pharaoh Ben-Gay (for the old Pharoah had retired in 
Sun City) loved Moses as he loved his own begotten son, 
Deep Heet. He even let Moses use h is army on Saturday 
nights . 

As we look upon the scene, Pharoah is sitting on his 
rocker in the Palace of Information Processing waiting 
for Moses to enter. The herald trumpets blare out "Born 
On The Bayou" and Moses and his train enter . 

'T he mighty Moses l" cried the page. 
"The old blowhard ," Pharoah commented to the 

Princess Purina. 
Purina hadn't quite heard nim, " He does what?" 
Pharoah had not time to reply for Moses approached 

his feet and, bowing low, spoke. 
"Great Pharoah !" he yelled . " I bring you Ethi opia'" He 

stepped aside and with an expansive gesture, bid the

They were goods such as to warm the hearts of kings'. 

They brought ivory, banjos, watermelom, wood and 
gold . 

" And more," announced Moses, " I pre~e nt the King 
and Queen of Ethiopia ." 

The aforesaid king and queen strode to the throne to 
a fanfare of " I Heard It Through The Grapevinp" 

"Kneel to Pharoah," commanded Deep Heet 
" No," said Moses, " they are allies . They shall be our

Pharoah was pleased and later talked to Moses of 

another enterprise. 
"Moses, I should like your help. As you know, I am 

building a temple city for Walla Walla, god of boring 
c ities. It pains me that work is progressi ng slowly . There 
is muttering amongstthetrade unions, and the slaves are 
demanding longer water breaks and shorter whips ." 

" If I undertake this project, sha ll I have a free hand?" 
Moses inquired. 

"Only if you don't raise costs."

for you wholesale." 

Soon Moses found himself in Walla Walla, to the joy

hiding behind a pillar in the Agora. He hailed a chariot 
and traveled around the site, surveying -the work . As he 
was driving around he heard screams of anguish . The 
slaves were pushing a huge stone block to be placed in 
the temple of Pentax, god of huge stone blocks. One of 
the water girls had gotten the hem of her garment 
caught underneath the mobile monolith , and was in 
danger of losing her dress. An agile stonecutter named 
Marcus Aurelius grabbed an Egyptian guard and bade 
him stop the stone, to little avail. 

"Stop the .stone! " cried Moses, and he motioned 
Aurelius to come over to him . 

" What is the old woman to you that you should as!.. 
for her life," demanded Moses. 

Marcus shrugged . "She owes me five ." 
Moses ordered one of the guards to cut the womall 

loose. Then he talked to Marcus. "What do your people 
lack that they will be happier and more productive?" 

" We. need much," Marcus lamented, "but mostly food 
and drink. The guards who stand around do n.othin~, 
but eat well , while we who work must eat at Mac 
Donald's. We would much rather have grain." 

'Where is there grain?" asked Moses. 
" The temple of Onomatopoeia!" shouted fhe slaves . 
The granaries of the temple were raided by the order 

of Moses, and the slaves' work improved. Deep Heet 
was suspicious of Moses' conces)ions to the slaves and 
talked his father into visiting Walla Walla to see for 
himself. â€¢ 

Chariot One brought Ben-Gay and Deep Heet to 
Moses' suite where he was busily engaged in watching 
the slave girls through a telescope. 

" I'd rate that one about a-hello,father! " 
" You don't eem very happy to see me, Mo es," 

Over 200 Grinningblrd ' every day connecli~g~rthÂ­

Pharoah said, climbing out of the tiger pit 
"Nonsense, father . I'm glad to ~ee you .. 
"Uh, Moses Deep Ht'('t tells me that you 've been 

giving the slaves a day off as well as mor grub." 
Pharoah looked at Mo~es " Is thiS true/" 

Moses pointed 10 a cherry tree . " I cannot tell a lie," 
he answered . " It is true " 

"The slaves will grow fat and lazy With thiS treat-
ment," Deep H et comm nted dryly 

"Nol" Moses protested "Tired slaves make few 
bricks, hungry slaves make less " He paused for p(felt 
" Dead slaves make fertilizer " 

The attendants fe ll to t heir knee~ and gave Mose~ a 
standing ovation Deep Heet turned hiS head and 
Pharoah smiled . He asked one slave to fetch him soml' 
water 

"Yes, your ferocity " 
Ben-Gay nodded to Deep Heel. " This one bores mp 

Kill him ." 
One shot straight from the hip and the slave got a 

forty year short cut to the Promised Land. 
"Now, Moses, show me Walla Walla " 
"Over here is the temple proper, to the left of II. the 

temple improper. That one there is the European Health 
Spa and Credit Book Store. Then, of course, the 
Washington Monument, the Arc de Triomphe, and the 
Colossus of Rhodes. Incidentally, we got a good deal on 
that one. The Greeks practically gave it away " 

"Beware of Greeks bearing ." 
" Yeah , I've heard it, Deep Heet," Moses Interrupted 
Pharoah looked at Deep Heet and jerked a thumb at 

Moses. 'This is my beloved son, in whom I am well 
pleased ." 

Deep Heet regarded him cooly " You've been sk ip-
ping ahead again , father " 

Moses was happy, Pharoah was happy, and the 
Hebrews in Mogen were, at the least, less sad . The only 
two who were sad were Deep Heet because he stood a 
good chance of losing the Pharoah phranchis and the 
Princess Purina because she knew the truth of Moses' 
heritage A for Moses, he didn 't know JackÂ·or Harry, for 
that matter

After dlnn r In the Blue Room, Moses and PUrina 
went to Purina's chambers to talk 

" That wa a mddJy decent dinner, PUrina But you 
know what1 I 'm still hungry ,," So saying, Moses made 
his move. 

But Purina gave him the cold shoulder. "No, Mo es, 
please . Not now," she demurred, removing her cape and 
flinging herself seductively on the divan Mose quickly 
knelt beside her. 
" Whi!t 's wrong, dearest? Don't you love mel" 

" Yes," she sobbed, " and if you'll notice, I 've also 
epoxied your kneecaps to the floor ." 

.She was right . "Why have you done this?" 
"Moses," she continued, "who is your mother?" 
'Why, you know as well as I she is Menthol of the 

Fresh Breath ." 
Purina shook her head and the rattle caught Moses' 

attention . " Wrong again . Your mother is Pacificbel. " 
'What? Who is she?" Â· 
Purina tried to stop crying, but the onion slices taped 

under her eyes were too strong "She is a slave, Moses." 

Moses was stupified . "Wha ... ?"

In his first ever contact with students of the 

University, Dr. Leonard Oldspot, Chairman of the 
Department of Ancient Igbo Studies, yesterday an-
nounced to reporters the fifth anniversary of the 
founding of the Committee of Educational Destiny. Dr . 
Oldspot is unofficial spokesman and czar-intellectual of 
the group which plays a key role in the educational 
policies of the University. 

" For five solid years," Dr. Oldspot exclaimed, "the 
C.E.D. has made known to the Academic Senate, the 
current mood of students on campus." 

The committee has gained most attention for the 
numerous strong stands which it has taken throughout 
the years. In Dr. Oldspot's own office were created the 
timely and unsuccessful protests against co-education 
of the dormatories. In another initiative, legal action 
was suggested to divert funds from the controversial 
Third College to a multi-million dollar Igbo Studies 
complex. More recently the C.E.D. has received 
notoriety for its proposed Muir dog-slaughter program. 

"However," Dr . Oldspot said excitedly, "the most 
important problem we've been faced with is to decide 
whether or not P.E. should be allowed academic credit. " 
Saying he would deny it if quoted, in a soft voice he 
informed a Triton Times reporter that P.E. had no 
academic merit and he had therefore decided it would 
not be given credit regardless of what the other com-
mittee members thought . 

Nervously clutching a copy of 'Plato's Republic' the 
doctor announced that some people knew better what 
the students wanted than the students did themselves. It 
was simply a matter of finding those people and 
allowing them to make all the decisions concerning the 
students' welfare. He explained that U.C.S .D. was lucky 
to employ a professor who was so knowledgable about 
the needs of today's students, and promised to do his 
best to represent us. 

When asked why students were not allowed to attend 
the meetings of the committee, much less participate; 
Oldspot pointed out the committee already had two 
appointed students as non voting members. Both the 
Students, Lucy Reagan and Lennie Oldspot Jr. are in the 
Igbo honors program . Dr . Olclspot explained it was 
c learly nece .sary to prohibit the rest of the 

emotioncharg ~dimmature masses of students from 
attending the meetings to avoid a repetition of tragic 
incident like the destruction of the Revelle Plaza 
flagpole less than;: dc:::odp " 0 

Sadly conetÂ·ding that the Academic Senate passed 
over many o f hI s ideas in recent years. the Professor 
complained I, itterly about other members of the 
committee whO' he felt just didn't und rstand what 
students need"d as well as he did. At one time there was 
even some d scus~lon of inviting fuller student parÂ· 
ticipation , or at least announcing th existence of the 
C. E.D. to th student body and ~olic iting (or 
suggestiom 

"Lucki ly I was able to mUllle that sort of talk !" The 
Profes50r screamed angrily. " What would stud nts 
know about whel her or not In y should receive credit

Open Letter From John Weare 
My name is John Weare and I'm an assistant professor 

of chemistry at U.C.S.D. Nancy Hoover and I are 
running against three other candidates in the March 5 
Del Mar City Council Election. 

As you probably know, Del "1ar has been under in-
tense pressure in the last several years from major 
developers who want to build high~ensity luxury 
condom iniums in our city . There are currently over 300 
units of this type in the planning stages in our city. 

As a result of the city council election two years ago, 
in which U.C.S.D. student Tom Shepard was elected to 
the council, Del Mar has become a leader in developing 
a rational plan for growth , However, this trend towards 
sanity is threatened by development interests who have 
poured money and time into this year's election in the 
hope of regaining control of the city . 

Whi Ie our opponents have spent the last two months 
calling us "sinister forces" and hinting at a conspiracy 
by the university to take over the city, we have tried to 
address what we believe are the real issues facing the 
city; the need for balance in our existing housing in-
ventory which includes rental and not ~st condominum 
units, the need to protect the essentially low~nsity 
residential character of the city, the importance of 
con troll ing the increasing property taxes which hurt

Well then, wipe those

listen to this! The Energy

right, fol ks, the worst 
rumors you've heard are

what you can do about it . 

both homeowners and renters, ,the need to insure equal 
and impartial enforcement of the law by the sheriWs 
department-protection for which we all pay but from 
which only some receive service. 

We believe many residents support these goals and 
we believe we can win the election. 

However, we need your help. Tom Shepard defeated 
a major R-3 landowner by only 125 voles two years ago . 
That year over 300 students voted . For the first time in 
Del Mar, everyone had to accept the fact that young 
people were a factor in the electoral process. 

This year, over 400 students are registered in Del Mar. 
Nancy and I cannot win without your help. We need 
people to help with phoning on Monday and Tuesday. 
We need people to work at the polling places . And most 
importandy, we need your vote. 

One of the th ings I like best about Del Mar is that I 
feel I can make a difference as an ind;"idual in what 
happens to my city. Each of you has that same opÂ· 
portunity and I sincerely hope you will take advantage 
of it. If you have any questions or you would I ike to help 
for the next few days, please feel free to call me or 
Nancy. My home phone is 755-6874 and Nancy's is 755-

~ownin' m the Oil 
by Bob Novak 

[sung to the tune Blowin' In The Wind] 
How many roads must a man drive dow.n 

before he can find some gas? 
How many times mÂ·ust a man get uptight 
till his nerves are as fragile as glass? 
Yes and how many times must the prices go up 
before they're a pain in the ass? 
The answer my friend, is drown in' in the oil, 
the answer is drownin' in the oil. 
How many miles must we cut down our speed 
to conserve what little there is? 
How many times will an honest man siphon 
what isn't legally his? 
Yes and how many times will they keep us confused 
just like on a damn physiCS quiz? 
'the answer my friend, is drownin' in the oil, 
the answer is drownin' in the oil. 
How many hours must a man wait in line 
Is it one, two, three, five or four? 

How many lies will the people be fed 
till they just can't take any more? 
Yes and how many dollars do the oil kings want 
till their profits cease to soar? 
The answer my friend, is drown in' in thP oil,

Graffiti 
Editor, 

I n our letter of Jan uary 
29, 1974, we stated that we 
felt that the old mural on 
the water tank was part of 
student expression on this 
campus. Perhaps we should 
have clarified the words, 
"student expression" , 
Unfortunately, some group 
has taken the liberty of 
misinterpreting what we 
meant-the mural has now 
been replaced by a perfect 
example of childish graffiti . 
(In order to avoid being 
misunderstood once more, 
Webster's New World 
Dictionary defines "graffiti" 
as : "an inscription , slogan, 
drawing, etc . crudely 
scratched or scribbled (or, 
in this case, painted) on a 
wall or other public sur-
face.") 

Sincewe talked about the 
aesthetic values of the old 
mural , we intended to

imply that the student 
expression we referred to 
was one of creative, artistic, 
or constructive merits , 
Whether or not you liked 
the old mural, there was 
nothi ng in its content that 
would be found as obÂ· 
jectionable . The "new 
replacement" does not fit 
any of the above 
qualifications; moreover, 
the pai nt job is very sloppy . 

If, in any way, our 
previous letter caused or 
encouraged the painting of 
this graffiti, we offer the 
community of U.C.S.D. our 
sincerest apologies. And. 
we would like to thank the 
Mad Arab, B.A., and the 
S.B. in general for proving 
once agai n that some 
college students aren't 
mature enough for college; 
we hope they are proud of 
their contribution to our 
academic community . 
Sincerely, 
Gregory Cutter and Ilene 
Hirsch 

Idealism 
Idealism is something all 

of us as students have 
experienced at sometime or 
another. We have visions of 
doing great and meaningful 
things that will shape a 
world of peace and har-
mony . But somewhere 
during the course of our 
development we perceive 
our idealism begin to fade 
away into the common hue 
of the day. IdealiSm gives 
way to cynicism at best and 
hatred and anger at worst. 
We find that our visions 
have been clouded over 
with a fog of defeatism as 

multitudes 01 formerly 
vivacious and idealistic 
young people begin to join 
the ranks of countless 
others who have sacrificed 
their ideals in the face of 
the omn ipresent enemy 
"opposition " . 

My name is Donald 
Murphy and I was ap-
pointed by the Revelle 
College Council to 
represent the students of 
Revelle College on The 
Undergraduate Student 
Council. To me this means I 
am your servant . To you I 
hope it means you have 
someone to work for the 
attainment of your ideals in 
regards to education. I have 
not and will not give up my 
idealistic outlook on life 
but only have it mellowed 
by further experience and 
understanding of my fellow 
man. 

Some may say it is naive 
to hold on to youthful 
visions and idealistic hopes. 
If those of you who are of 
the latter opinion mean that 
experience will strip me of 
my desire to grow in love 
and friendship with my 
fellow man and that I will 
lose the will to understand, 
then you are one of those 
that have been defeated by 
the very things I am 
committed to overcoming. 

It is my bel ief that our 
present form of education is 
only a reflection of the 
individual members of what 
is called the educational 
system . I t reflects our atÂ· 
titudes, hopes and 
aspiration . Each individual

Concerts: Charles Hyde Music of the America's Festival 
Jean-Pierre Rampal . 

Robert Veyron-l....acroix 
Occasionally a concert has a thread of excellence 

that runs through it tying it together into a coherent and 
artistic whole. Such was predictably the case when Jean-
Pierre Rampal and Robert Veyron-lacroix came to 
Sherwood Hall in La Jolla . Their combined technical 
mastery and artistic inventiveness never cease to excite 
the listener; it was with good reason that this concert 
was long sold out . 

This famous flute and keyboard duo is heralded for 
perform ances of 17th and 18th cen tury work s The 
audience Saturday night was entertained by three 
Baroque Sonatas of differen t styles : Handel's Italien 
style, Leclai r's French style, and Bach's uniqu late 
German style Perhaps some may find it surprisi ng that 
Baroque music, often chastized for all sounding the 
same, is composed of se parate and multifarious periods 
and sty les On the contrary, I know of no other p riod 
where separation and differentiation of style plays such 
an important role in performance practices; equanimity 
of styles is what typifies an uninteresting performance, 
and provokes boredom with Baroque music in general. 
If a complaint may be made with the <-oncert, it was a 
lack of ciear delineation of ~tyles with these diverse 
pieces. Rampal 's tone is consistantly limpid and bright 
throughout all registers, and is a marvel of flute 
technique. I wish some of this pulchritude of sonority 
would have been better applied towards projection of 
composer's intent than of tone alone. Nonetheless, it is 
beautiful , and this is what the audience came to hear. 

Veyron-lacroix's rea lization of the bass was con-
tinually excellent. It was the practice in Baroque times 
to write only the bas.s line of the accompaniment; that 
is, the left hand. The right hand was to be improvised 
accordingly to a relatively sparce skeleton of harmony 
also usually noted by the composer. While this allows 
the modern performer great flexibility, it also leaves him 
with the task of "realizing" the full harmony from only 
this lean fragment, and to turn it into an interest~ ng and 
musically significant part of the performance. This is 
indeed what Veyron-Lacroix did, and the result was 
superlative. 

After intermission , there was a dramatic change of 
centuries as the duo performed pieces by Aaron 
Copland (1900- ) and Serge Prokofiev (1891-1953). The 
Copland duo was composed in 1971, and provided a 
welcome change from his complex, noisy works of 
recent years. It was quite melodious in parts, and had a 
temperment well suited to that of Rampal , with both 
slow passages and dazzling fingerwork . The Prokofiev 
Sonata was perhaps the most successful piece of the 
evening . Here Rampal's predilection towards breakneck 
speeds was matched by music demanding it , a fortunate 
and somewhat rare occurance. 

The concert was extremely well received by the 
packed house. The cheers were reciprocated with four 
excellently played encores . One could hardly ask for 
more from these great artists than for a speedy return to 
San Diego.

Science Synopsis 
J. Snoclgrus. Ed. 

See Synthetically 
Synesthesia can now be experienced without the 

ingestion of halucinogens and the concomitant risk of 
permanently short-circuiting the brain. Scientists have 
developed devices which, ,aided by rigorous training, 
allow the substitution of one sense for another without 
chemicals. The present goal of this research is the 
development of an efficient artificial sight. 

Dr . Bach-y-Rita, an associate, of Smith-Kettlewell 
Institute of Visual Sciences, noted' that the brain can 
work around an injury, at times r~ring a lost function . 
Once destroyed, brain cells do not regenerate. 
However, the idea that certain areas of the brain serve 
particular senses-that sight, hearing, touch, and so on, 
have particular locations- is not strictly true. Bach-y-
Rita bases his research on the concept that one area of 
the brain can perform two functions, specifically, touch 
can be perceived as sight. 

The system developed involves a pair of mini-
television cameras possibly mounted on a person 's 
spectacles , which selld signals to a matrix of skin 
stimulators on his abdomen . The person can then be 
trained to perceive the electrir and vibrational sen-
sations experienced by hi< ~romach as visual input. 
Blind people can it' this way achieve, even if 
rudimentary, some form of sight through touch . 

With present technology, the perception of touch as 
sight requires monumental willpower, a pressing 
motivation to learn, funds, and in the case of loss of 
sight via injury, sufficient remaining grey matter for 
utilization. But the capability is there to be exploited. At I 
the present such devices allow blind persons to read 
meters and assemble electronics through a microscope. 
360 degree vision for pilots will probably be the next 
elaboration , and when SU( h systems are commercially 
produced, man will have taken his evolut ion another 
step toward a more efficipnt human-machine hybrid .

sophistication both in the 
complexities of its design 
and the abstruseness of its 
purpose. 

A report delivered at the 
Third International Con-
ference on Artificial In-
tellillence, held at Stanford 
University, notefi that 
society may soon feel the 
impact of intelligence 
gathering systems applied 
to the prediction of social 
trends. As a result, policy 
formulation may better 
reflect public opinion, but 
opinion may also be ren-
dered easier to instigate 
with policy. 

Furthermore, from large 
quantities of coordinated 
data, eHicient systems may 
arise to monitor the ac-
tivities of subversive 
factions. Though this idea is 
well-worn , technologies 
involved are hot off the 

drawinl board . The 
mathematical analysis of 
political power, for 
example, is well un-
derstood, but the lack of 
necessary hardware, along 
with certain laws resarding 
the invasion of privacy, 
have prevellled its ap-
plication in the U.S. 

By submitting the 
movements and contacts of 
busy executives to com-
puter analysis, a company 
might be able to discover 
the actual, as opposed to 
the apparent, roots of 
power in a competing firm . 
The brainy executive ad-
vising the president can 
subsequently be bought off, 
and an advantage gained. 

By 1980, scientists 
predict, personal iden-
tification systems will be 
produced commercially . 
Thus, of most import to 
I ibertarians is the advent of 
a government with 
automated insides. When 
the mechanics of law, 
education, and health care 
are computerized, as en-
visioned at Stanford, a 
heavier concentration of 
power in an elite ruling 
class may result. -

Scientists Warned 
About Use 0/ Dogma 

SANTA BAREsARA - Are 
biology teachers, in their 
fight to keep concepts of 
divine creation out of 
science textbooks, relying 
too heavily on dogmatism 
themselves? 

Unfortunately, Â·tnis is 
sometimes the case, says 
Dr . Adrian Wenner, 
professor of biology at the 
University of California, 
Santa Barbara (UCSB) . He 
blames " the human need 
for certainty for bringing 
about a paradoxical 
situation in wh ich a 
scientific attitude is 
discouraged in biology 
classrooms . As a con-
sequence, the teacher 's 
intellectual base becomes 
weakened . 

Uncertainty IS un -
comfortable, Dr. Wenner 
said in a recent interview. 
Positive findings are en-
couraged by teachers, 
negative ones are de -
emphasized . It is a rare 
biology textbook or review 
book that clearly and 
repeatedly distinguishes 
between fact and in -
terpretation , or presents 
interpretations as the 
tentative hypotheses they 
often turn out to be . 

Repeating the advice he 
offered last spring in the 
journal, " The American 
Biology Teacher, Wenner 
urges biology teachers to 

keep science an open - not 
a closed - book. 

"Let us put science back 
into all of biology 
teaching," he wrote. "Let us 
give biology students a 
I iberal education by 
teaching them to ask, for 
example : How does a fact 
differ from a hypothesis and 
the latter from a theory? 
How can a scientjst 
overcome his o~n biases? Is 
the creation explanation a 
cultural or a scientific 
explanation? Is evolution 
theory really scientific? Can 
it be tested?" 

The biology teacher , 
having thus rededicated 
himself to teaching the 
scientific method and 
having cleansed himself of 
dogma, will then be in-
tellectually and morally 
equipped to debate the 

fundamenta.ll~ts, according 
to Wenner . 

" If these dogmatists insist 
that the 'theory' of creation 
be included in biology 
courses, and if we are 
compelled to include it, let 
is be so - but only if 
teacners are allowed to 
handle the topic in a 
scientific manner," he said. 

"Biology is a science; 
therefore we can insist that 
creationism must not be 
given special treatment. It 
must not be sneltered from 
the scientific scrutiny we 
eventually bring to all ::========;;; hypotheses and theories ."

Ultrasound 
Diagnosis 

SANT A BARBARA - The sound "seen" around the 
world . This is how a sound imaging system for medical 
diagnosis with capacity beyond X-ray may be described 
when it becomes an everyday tool in hospitals and 
perhaps in doctors' oHices within three to five years, 
according to Electrical Engineering Professor Glen 
Wade of the University of California, Santa Barbara. 

Dr . Wade and his colleagues Dr. John landry and H. 
Keyani, who are among a handful of pioneer ex-
perimenters working in this area, have produced what 
they believe is the first ultra-sound imaging system for 
medical diagnosis based on Bragg diffraction of laser 
light to operate below five megahertz . At this 
frequency, sound will readily penetrate biological tissue 
at power levels well within the safe limits for human 
subjects, they state. So safe, in fact, it can be used on 
the human eye. 

Can "See" Orpns 
Unlike X-ray, ultrasound imaging can 'see' organs, 

muscles and other soft tissues within the body, in-
dudins fetuses, cloaed veins and arteries and incipient 

Eledrical EnalllHfl"l Profnsor Clen Wilde of UCSD 
observes pulled lazer bellm moduled by sound 
equipment. Unlike X-rilY, ultrnound imilging Ciln"see" 
orpns, muscles and other soft tissues induding those 
inside bones. 
tumors . Also unlike X-rays, it can penetrate such opaque 
objects as bones to reveal hidden tissues. 

" Acoustic wave images clearly show, for example, 
where tendons hook onto muscles, and can differentiate 
among types of muscles," Dr. Wade says. 

Moving images can be produced as well as still ones. 
Wade and his colleagues have made motion pictures 
from ultrasound images of fish swimming about, the 
bone structure and internal organs clearly visible. They 
believe that this ability to watch a subject in motion will 
be extremely useful to doctors in their diagnosis of 
patients suffering from certain forms of disabilities , 
such as heart valve malfunction . 

Wade describes the system as being remarkably 
simple and relatively cheap, consisting primarily of an 
ultrasound generating device, a laser, a water tank and 
an observation screen or closed-circuit television 

sy~tem for viewing . 
How It Works 

Basically it works like this : The ultra-sound rays, 
which are directed at an object in a water tank (water 
being used because it is the best ':ledium for ~ran Â­
sporting the sound), penetrate the ob!ect and contmue 
until their path intersects that of light .rays fr~ a 
helium neon laser. The laser beam is then diffracted mto 
a pattern which forms what amou.nts to . an .optical 
replica of the acoustic beam . ThiS replica IS then 
projected onto a screen. 

Because those sound waves passing through bone or 
cartilage, for example, dissipate more energy than .th.ose 
penetrating veins or muscles, they produce a . dlstmc-
tively different image on the screen, glvmg the 
diagnostician a revealing and useful picture.. . 

Dr . Wade believes that this and similar sound Imagmg 
systems might advance from their current laboratory 
stage into the family doctor's office within three to fl~e 
years, and should certainly be an everyday diagnostic 
tool in hospitals within this time. 

Similar principles are being applied to acoustic 
microscopes, which offer the researcher the advantage 
of being able to view very small organisms while they 
are alive, a condition not possible with the electron 
microscope.

days you can't just get decent help. That stupid sports 
staff, I wish they'd go play baseball with a bottle of 
nitroglycerine or watch the AAU track meet in New 
York, and walk there and back . Take a look at the editor, 
sweet old' Eric, what a chump. Here I go, putting him in 
charge of an entire page all by himself and paying him a 
glossy salary, and what do I get, he has to leave town 
with the dang blasted whuppenslunger volleyball team . 
And as for the stupid Untitled Staff, what good are they

the team competition 
UCSD's grapplers finished 
in log jam with several 
other teams in and around 
5th to 8th pla.ce. 

I nd ivi dually severa l 
wrestlers did quite well. 
Ri c hard Salompessy 
finished second in the 118 
lb . weight class, losi ng only 
to an ex-all -american J. C. 
wrestler . Two other UCSD 
grapplers took fifth p laces . 
Leroy McNair in the 134 Ib 
d ivision and Don Jennings 
in the Unlimited class . 

On the season as a whole 
the team has been plagued 
by injuries and illness 
according to Coach Pat 

Pinkerton . Two of his most 
outstanding wrestlers, Allen 
Ota and Jose Cueto have 
been injured recently 
although they participated 
in most of the dual meets. 

In the dual meet part of 
the season the Triton 
Wrestlers came out with a 
3-2 record . 

Coach Pinkerton is also 
looking forward to next 
season as all but three of 
this year's wrestlers are 
freshmen and only two will 
not be returning next year. 
Sa lompessy, Ota and Cueto 
are all freshmen and are 
expected to be the nucleus 
of next year's team .

explained that these inÂ· 
dividual assignments in 
natural resource con-
servation and ecological 
research provide op-
portunities for field work, 
teaching and adÂ· 
ministration . 

Coleman and Byrnes urge 
appl ications duri ng the 
three days at UCSD from 
seniors and graduate 
students interested in Peace 
Corps and V 1ST A projects 
which are scheduled to 
begin training in June, July 
and August. 

Representing ACTION, 
the federal voluntary 
service agency which 
merged the Peace Corps 
and VISTA in 1971 , 
Coleman an'd Byrnes said 
that Peace Corps provides 
Volunteers with travel 
opportunities, ample in-
country living allowances, 
48 days paid vacation, plus 
a readjustment sum of 
$2 ,000 following com-
pletion of the two year 
overseas assignment. VISTA 
Volunteers receiving living 
allowances , t ravel ex-
penses, medical care and an 
added monthly stipend of 
$50 during their one year of 
service within low-income 
communities throughout 
the United States . 

During a si milar 
Volunteer drive in October, 
a total of 21 Peace Corps 
and VISTA applications 
from the UCSD campus 
were recorded.

continued from page '1 
on the bus. 

The manager would 
probably be paid about 
$3 .50/ hr. for up to 19 
hours per week. Anyone 
interested in this position 
should contact Student 

Fmnlr"'~~-t here on 
campus. 

Due to a Public Utility 
Commission restriction , a 
charter operator, like 
Aztec Bus Co, can ' t 
collect cash from 
customers. Thus monthly 
passes, good for unlimited 
riders , and "one-ride 
tickets" would probably 
be sold on campus. Th,e 
proposal assumes that 100 
staff and 200 students 
would be served by each 
bus. 

Additional income to 
subsidize operation is 
expected to come from 
advertizing which will be 
sold in and on the buses. 
This may be a con-
siderable amount of inÂ· 
come . The Bug Line, 
which runs buses to San 
Diego State, now receives 
about $1,000 per bus, per 
month from ad income. 

The exact routes for the 
buses have not yet been 
olanned. nor have times. 
if this proposal is ap-
proved by the Vice 
chancellor of Business and 
Finance, Herman Johnson, 
service could begin the 
week before or the week 
after finals . 
continued from page b 

For i nformation con-
cerning the quilting 
workshop or Gallery 8, call 
453Â·2000 ext. 1942 or visit 
the Gallery in the InÂ· 
ternational Center . Classes 
are limited to 20, and begin 
soon. 

Sophistry 
continued from plge 5 
milligrams of perspicaity 
wasn 't mesmerized by this 
typical socialist sophistry in 
an attempt to muddy the 
waters and obfuscate the 
REAL issue. The crux of the 
affair and the question 
which really needs to be 
answered is why did she 
falsify her address? Was she 
ashamed to give public 
notice of her residence in a 
tenement, ghetto or slum 
area? Well , if so, she missed 
her chance to champion her 
cause as a real "people's" 
candidate . Was she 
ashamed to I ist her 
residence as a plush 
condomi nium in suburbia? 
Here again she might have 
used this to her advantage 
as a candidate who has 
denoun ced all the 
" capitalistic materialism" 
Or did he fals ify her 
residence beca use she 
actually didn't qualify as a 
candidate in that district 
and hence was defrauding 
the public, ie, "the people"? 
For any reason, ipso facto 
of her filling false can-
didacy papers he has 
I inked her elf to the very 
conglomerate of officials 
whom he is denouncing 
because !he also lied "to 
the peopl,>" . 

Yes, Salm dar, there IS a 
'Watergate' in San Diego-
and you are 11. Only this 
time, it was averted before 
bei"" t::I L Ii tv \,);;;1..". 
Even if I had sympathetic 
leanings toward your cause, 
I wouldn't consider voti ng 
for you as your credibili ty is 
a aby mal as everyone 
else's
