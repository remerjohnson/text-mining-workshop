Dishwalla, Rahzel. The Aquabats and 
Eo.N. performed Fnday on RIMA field to 
end the Sun God celebration. 

The headliner, Dishwalla, drew mostly 
mixed opInions from the crowd. 

"Dishwalla used to be cool, freshman 
year of high school: said MUIr freshman 
Steve RCls. "'Counting Blue Cars' was a 
good song, but they staned mixing it With 
ACiDC. Then the crowd wanted AGDC 
instead." 

Others said that the mixing of the songs 
was an effective and entenaining part of the 
band's performance. 

"\Dishwalla) was really good." said Muir 
freshman Adam Struve. "( can't believe how 
good Dishwalla is at Singing other groups' 
songs." 

Students who attended the concen said 
that Rahzel, a member of Roots, was the 
most impressive of the performers due to his 
stage presence and ability to imitate sounds

UCSD Scientists 
Discover Cause 
of Ant Invasion 
Proliferation of Argentine ants is 
due to lack of genetic diversity 
among population 
"VINCINr~ News Editor 

UCSD biologists discovered 1M the prolif-
eration of the Argentine ant in California is due 
to the lack of genetic diversity among the ants. 

The ants are the No. 1 pest that extermina-
tion cOlllpanies are caUed upon to remove from 
people's homes. 

"If you live in urban San Diego or Los 
Angeles. this is the ant that's in your house and 
is invading your garden and office. ~ said Neil 
Tsutsui, a graduate student and one of the 
study's authors. . 

In the study, published in the March 16 
issue of the Proceedings of the National 
Academy of Sciences, the scientists concluded 
that reduced genetic variation has aUowed a 
giant "supercolony· of closely related ants to 
grow unchecked from San Diego to Ukiah, 100 
miles north of San Francisco. 

In Argentina, however, fighting among the 
more genetically dissimilar territorial ants has 
managed to keep these insects in check and in 
smaller, more sharply defined colonies than 
those in California. 

"When we did our field work in Argentina, it 
was surprisingly -difficult to find Argentine ants, 
compared to our experience in California; said

Carmen Electra Guest Stars on 
Final Episode of Gleib Show 
Many students impressed by actress' stage presence 
Associate News Editor 

Ben Gleiberman hosted his last show 
Thursday night in the Price Center Plaza with 
guest Cannen Electra, kicking off the week-
end Sun God festivities. 

"I thought it was really good,~ said Marshall 
freshman Brian Capanna. "Going in, , didn't 
expect it was going to be this way." 

Those in attendance said Electra's stage 
presence contradicted all previous notions 
they once had of the actress. 

"Going into the event, I had many precon-
ception$ of Carmen Electra; said Revelle 
junior Eric Robin. "I assumed she would just 
be another drop-dead-gorgeous bimbo. 
However, Ms. Electra proved me to be very 
wrong and actually had a lot to say." 

Electra, who was on for 20 minutes, 
danced with members of Greensboro Lane. 
Gleiberman's band for the night, before sit-
ting down to answer some questions. 

"She presented herself very well; Robin 
said. "Electra proved to me, and the rest of 
the crowd, that there is more to Carmen than 
just a hot body.· 

Capanna said that Electra's answers to 
Gleiberman's questions, a few of which per-
tained to her marriage with basketball player' 
and actor Dennis Rodman, surprised him. 

"She said that Dennis helped her get over 
her mother's cancer death; he said. "' thought 
that was really interesting. This whole interview 
really legitimizes her character for me.· 

In addition to Electra's appearance, 
Gleiberman aired a parody he made of the 
movie "American Beauty." Those in attendance 

said they were amused with "American Booty." 
"The movie was really funny and true to 

the original." Capana said. "Gleiberman did a 
~ood job portraying the characters and mak-
Ing some really interesting twists." 

Gleibennan, the creator and host of "The 
Gleib Show; followed the typical late night 
talk show formula by coming out on stage, ' 
performing a monologue, bringing out a few 
fake products that he invented, introducing 
his special guest star and then proceeding 
with other comedic routines. 

The show, which normally airs on Muir 
Television, will end its fourth and final season 
next month.

"I think he sold his soul to the 

devil to get those talents,n said Muir 
freshman Jon McClarty. "I was com-
pletely amazed." 

Despite the crowd's approval of 
Rahzel, some were unsatisfied with 
the other bands. 

"For the most part, the bands this 
year were pretty lame,n said Reis. 
"Nobody had heard of them until talk 
of Sun God came about." 

Many students said they liked the 
day's events, even thou~h they 
thought the bands were mediocre. 

"People were interested in the Sun 
God festival in general: Reis said. 
"but most were not really interested 
in the concert." . 

For some. the bands meant little to 
the success of the entire day. 

" It was nice to see everyone at the 
school coming together for at least 
one day: said Marshall freshman 
Manson Huie. "Price Center was 
tilled with people. I wish the school 
was like that more often." 

Starting at 10 a.m .• clubs such as 
the DJs and Vinylphiles Club per-
formed shows at the Price Center 
Plaza to large crowds of students. 

"Those guys looked like they put a 
lot of time and effort into perfecting 
their performance.n Huie said. 
"Though they must have been nervous 
dancing in front of a crowd that size, I 
am sure the benefits they received far 
outweighed that initial trepidation." 

Over 30 clubs were on Library 
Walk and 45 more were on the Sun 
God lawn selling food and drinks and 
passing out infortnation about their 
organization. 

"For once there was some good 
food on campus: said Muir junior 
Nate Rossi. "It was a nice change 
from the monotonous and typical 
food at the Price Center: 

In addition, the A.S. Council.

Ants: 
Proliferation has been a 
problem for native species 
Conthwed froID ..... 1 

Professor of biology Ted Chase, who 
headed the research team. "They are a 
relatively inconspicuous feature, both 
in the urban and natural environment" 

The ants are thought to have 
entered the United States aboard ships 
carrying coffee or sugar during the 
1890s. then expanded throughout 
California and the southern parts of 
the United States. 

Tsutsui and his colleagues found 
that the low genetic diversity among 
the California ants occurred because 
they are all descended from a relatively 
small population of genetically similar 
ants from one colony or closely related 
colonies in Argentina. 

"Because they've gone through a 
genetic bottleneck. everybody's genet-
ically similar and everybody recog-
nizes everybody else as a member of 
their own colony.n he said "In 
essence. the supercolony that we see 
in California is in fact one big 
colony." 

In the United States, the ants' 
growth has not only been a problem 
for native ant species, but for species 
that feed on the larger native ants.

BRIEFLY 

GOV. Davis Forms New Partnership 
with UC, Cal State Systems 

Gov. Gray Davis. the University of California 
and the California State University have reached 
agreement on a new partnership that is expect-
ed to provide for continued investment and 
accountability in California higher education dur-
ing the coming years. 

The partnership, a set of agreements 
between the Davis administration and the two 
institutions, provides for predictable annual 
increases in General Fund support for the 
University of California and California State 
University, while also committing both systems 
to accountability in specific areas of perfor-
mance. It takes effect immediately and wiillast 
at least thr0Ulh 2002-03. 

The Davis administration aMOUnCed the part-
nership In a letter to the chairs of the state lea-
Islature's budget committees last week. 

The partnership aims to provide the 
University of California with growing financial 
resources in the coming years to help the uni-
versity plan for the future, Invest in core needs 
and provide access to an affordable, high-quality 
education for the 60,000 additional students 
expected to enroil at the university by 2010. The 
partnership also includes University of California 
commitments to timely gradUation, increased 
transfers from community colleges, expanded 
teacher training, continued collaboration with K-
12 schools and other objectives important to the 
state. 

The legislature will stili review the 
University of California's budCet annually. With 
the partnership, however, the Davis administra-
tion signals its intention to provide the univer-
sity with a predictable 4 percent increase of 
state General Fund money each year, plus fund-
ing for enrollment growth. In addition, the uni-
versity would receive a 1 percent increase ded-
icated to building maintenance. instructional 
equipment, instructional technology and 
libraries. These are areas in which funding 
backlogs exist and would receive additional 
one-time funding for these priorities when fiscal 
conditions permit. 

The partnership also would make funding 
available for annuitant benefits; for debt service 
related to capital outlay; and for new or expand-
ed initiatives such as the development of off-

~mpus centers. year-round operations, 
increased outreach to K-12 schools, or special 
research initiatives. The partnership includes 
$210 million per year for the University of 
California's facilities needs, consistent with 
voter-approved Proposition lA, and support for 
new capital funding after Proposition lA expires 

in 2001-02, ttvough either a new bond or other 
state funds. 

Additionally, the partnership calls for manda-
tory, systemwide student fees to rise each year 
by no more than the increase in California pet'-
capita personal Income. The governor and the 
leaislature would have the option of ·buying out· 
fee increases, as they have in recent years by 
providing equivalent General Fund money. The 
1999-2000 academic year is the fifth consecu-
tive year without a mandatory systemwide fee 
increase at the University of California. These 
fees have decreased 10 percent for resident 
undergraduates and 5 percent for resident ac~ 
ernic graduate students. 

In return for the state's funding commit-
ments, the University of California commits to 
accountability on a nlmber of key objectives, 
such as ensuring student access to the universi-
ty under the state Master Plan for Higher 
Education, maintaining faculty teachirw loadS 
that provide students with the classes they need 
for timely graduation, preservlrw competitive 
faculty salaries and more than doubllrw the nwn-
ber of teachers trained at the university by 2002-
03. 

The university also 'Will increase its 
research efforts to help California remain com-
petitive In the. k now Ied&e-based economy, 
Including creation of the California Institutes 
for Science and Innovation and expansion of 
the Industry-University Cooperative Research 
Program.

PINION 
INTELLECI 
PROPERTY 

Current legal battles over cqpyright 
i~ngement and the distrilJution of 
intelkctual property over the Internet are 
merely symptoms of a larger revolution 

~hat 'lS re~haping the way our society views 
znformatwn 
By 811DfT DON 
Opinion Editor 

Debates over intellectual 
property rights have figured 
largely In the news lately. The 
Recording Industry Association 
of America successfully sued 
MP3.com for offering streaming 
access to commercial music. A 
host of musical groups have 
sued the makers of the music 
search utility Napster for 
allegedly allowing users to ille-
gally transmit their songs. While 
lawyers for the music industry 
in these cases have been treat-
ing the matter as a fairly 
straightforward application of 
existing copyright laws, the 
overall trend of the distribution 
of intellectual property on the 
Internet seems to indicate that 
the issue is far more complex. 

These cases are actually 
indicative of a much larger trend 
of the public rejecting the con-
ventional limits on the distribu-
tion of intellectual property in 
the information boom that the 
explosion of the Internet has 
made possible. 

The Information Revolution 
is upon us. The name, 
Information Revolution, should 
not be taken lightly; it is, in fact, 
a revolution. Society is under-
going significant changes in the 
way information is communi-
cated, the way it is stored and 
the way people regard it. As 
access to information becomes 
more readily a~ailable , it is 
becoming less and less propri-
etary. Traditional views of intel-
lectual property will not fit neat-
ly into the new world that is 
growing around the Internet. 
Many of the industries that are 
being reinvented by the 
Information Revolution are not 
embracing these changes. 

Rather, they are fighting a futile 
battle to try to defend the status 
quo, even though it is becoming 
increasingly obvious to con-
sumers that this is not what the 
future has in store for them. 

As we have already witnessed, 
the entertainment industry has 
been the hardest hit by the 
Information Revolution . 
Consumers are becoming 
increasingly willing and able to 
enjoy music and video on per-
sonal computers rather than on 
traditional platfonns such as 
CDs and videocassettes. The 
software industry as been it 
almost as hard as the entertain-
ment sector. Not only has the 
Internet made software piracy 
easier and more widespread, it 
has also spawned open-source 
development projects that are 
creating competing products 
that are free. 

The publishing industry has 
not yet been severely affected by 
the Internet, but as companies 
start to develop hand-helO 
devices tha t can store text and 
books downloaded from the 
Internet, the information age is 
starting to introduce viable 
alternatives to printed literature. 
The printing industry has not 
experienced the same crush that 
the music industry has suffered, 
but rest assured that it will in the 
next decade. 

Society could not ignore the 
invention of the radio, which 
suddenly ' made it possible for 
consumers to listen to music for 
free. The recording industry was 
not able to prevent radio stations 
from playing their music over the 
airwaves, because the public 
demand for it was simply too 
great. Instead, it had to learn to 
adapt to this new system, where-
by radio audiences could listen to 
music for free on radio stations in 

exchange for putting up with 
advertisements. This is not to say 
that advertising is necessarily the 
solution to free media on the 
Internet - the proliferation of 
advertising in this arena is dis-
turbingly high as it is - but it is 
an example of how industries 
have been forced to cope with 
new technologies that radically 
change the way their products 
are consumed. 

The question that most law-
makers and industry leaders are 
asking the public about the free 
distribution of inteUectual prop-
erty on the Internet is, "How can 
we justify it?" They maintain that 
the authors of intellectual prop-
erty deserve to be compensated 
for development costs and the 
creativity that went into produc-
tion. Unfortunately, this question 
becomes irrelevant when the 
much more pressin$ question of 
"How can we stop It?" is asked. 
The answer to this second ques-
tion is quite simple: We can't 

There is no sense in trying to 
outlaw the free distribution of 
music on the Internet. The 
genie, as the saying goes, is out 
of the bottle. All the record 
executives and all the lawyers in 
the world can't stuff it back 
inside. Yet, they continl4e to 
waste their time trying. 

History offers a relevant 
comparison: prohibition. People 
really like alcohol. Their 
demand for it effectively trans-
lates into a need. Outlawing its 
sale did not serve to eliminate 
this need, it merely necessitated 
the development of illegal chan-
nels for supplying it. 

Music, like alcohol, is some-
thing that people want so badly 
that they essentially need it.

Skewed Revisitation of Vietnam-Era Protest Belie the Real Issues it Represented 
Editor: 
It is unfortunate that the 

Guardian continues to publish driv-
el written by Ben Boychuk ("30-
Year-Old Thagedy Still Haunts 
UCSD: May 15), the former 
UCSD student who made a habit 
while at this campus of regurgitat-
ing neoconservative propaganda in 
his opinion pieces. Apparently, 
Boychuk is still engaging in the 
kind of half-baked analyses that 
made his role model, Dinesh 
D'Souza, a minor celebrity in right-
wing circles during the 1990s. 

In his account of the tragic 
death of George Winne, a UCSD 
graduate student who, in May of 
1970, died by self-immolation in 
Revelle Plaza in order to protest 
the American war in Southeast 
Asia, Boychuk made the pre-
dictable move of mocking the 
entire period known as the '60s. 
"Fury: "mass psychology" and 
"The Communist Dream" is what 
motivated anti-Vietnatll War pro-
testers, says Boychuk, who appar-
ently has an anachronistic fond-
nesS' for red-baiting. A history 
class might have taught him that 
the Cold War ended around the 
time he came to UCSD, that is, 
over 1 0 years ago.

Editor: 
Ben Boychuck uses the 30th 

anniversary of George Winne's 
death ("30-Year-Old Tragedy Still 
Haunts UCSD: May 15) as an 
opportunity to issue sweeping 
condemnations of the anti-war 
movement. The piece deserves 
attention, if only because of the 
immensity of the violence that it 
seeks to obscure. The lack of 
compassion in the piece is notable 
but is ultimately of less impor-
tance than Boychuck's references 
to the "tragic duplicity" of the '60s 
era, the students who memorial-
ized Winne in 1990 as "keeping 
the lie alive: the "confusion and 
ideological opportunism that 
made [Winne) a tragic hero: and 

He screamed." In similar circum-
stances, we can suppose, someone 
of Boychuck's mettle would have 
taken it like a manl 

By making the ultimate sacrifice 
for his beliefs, Winne joined a long 
line of American pacifists who took 
their own lives in order to stor the 
killing. Like Nonnan Momson, 
who burned himself to death on 
November 2, 1965 outside the 
Pentagon, or Florence Beaumont, a 
56-year old wife and mother of two 
daughters who ignited herself in a 
pool of gasoline on the steps of the 
Los Angeles Federal Building on 
October 16, 1967, Winne made the 
deadly serious decision to act upon 
his religious principles.

._ the claim that "so many during 
that time" were engaged in a 
"youthful, thoughtless fight for a 
lie that knew no bounds and had 
one inexorable hatred: the truth: 

Given the topic, it is reasonable 
to suspect that the vagueness of 
Boychuck's charges is not acciden-
tal. While the anti-war movement 
was by no means without its prob-
lems, and there is no doubt that 
"truth" .!'\vas one of the earliest 
casualties of the war, the primary 
perpetrator of violence to the truth 
at the time, as well as to the people 
of Vietnam, was the government of 
the United States. After all, the war, 
which was responsible for the 
deaths of three million Vietnamese 
and nearly 60,000 Americans, was 
consistently justified as an effort to 
defend democracy in Soulh 
Vietnam, despite the fact that, as 
the ·Pentagon Papers" so famously 
confirmed, the government pri-
vately acknowledged that "South 
Vietnam was essentially the cre-
ation of the United States." The 
truth was indeed hated, but not by 
Winne or his supporters. 

Boychuk ought to be ashamed 
of himself. He would be lucky to 
have one ounce of the courage dis-
played by George Winne on that 

sunny spring day 30 years ago.

A Spontaneous Pet Purchase Goes Horribly Wrong 
The personal responsibility and legal implications of owning a pet on campus are all forgotten in the heat of the moment 
IJ DlVYA IlUNCHAL 
Columnist 

Who would think that one Iinle 
trip to the pet store could cause so 
much strife and misery? I never 
thought it could, but [ was in for an 
unpleasant surprise when [ ven-
tured to PETCO, the haven for pets 
and their owners alike. [t was there 
that [ met Prince, a charming, dark-
haired individual and [ inadvertent-
ly became 'a criminal as well. 

It all started one morning when 
[ woke up to find my three goldfish 
swimming in a sea of cloudy water. 
[mmediately, [ realized [ would 
need to get a new filter, unless I 
wanted my pets to suffer an 
untimely demise. A few hours hiter, 
I traveled to PETCO in my durable 
minivan, annoying crazy soccer 
moms as I weaved quick.ly in and 
out of lanes, knowing that the fates 
of Frufru, Sushi and Rabbit lay in 
my hands. 

About 15 minutes after leaving 
UCSD. I finally reached PETCO. [ 
hunied in and headed toward the 
aquatic depal1ment, where [ inter-
rogated an employee about the 
possible ramifications the dil1y 
water could have for my poor fish. 
Next, [ walked down several aisles 
until I found the necessary filters. 
After hoarding a couple of these, [ 
headed for the front of the store -
and that's when my hell began. 

As I casually glanced at the pet 
containers lining the walls. [ saw 
the cutest gerbil tucked in amongst 
a plethora of chinchillas, hamsters 
and rats. Like a greedy child stand-
ing outside a candy store, [ stuck 
my hands upon the glass and 
peered in. delighted to see two 
large eyes staring back at me. The 
gerbil. whom I immediately chris-

tened Prince (he was a male after 
all) was covered with brown fur and 
had an unusual splash of white on 
his forehead. Perhaps it was his 
chubbr physique. or the fact that 
his thick fur reminded me of my 
own, that enamored me. 

Whatever it was, [ was trans-
fixed and knew [ had to have him. 
[ quickly motioned an employee 
over and asked her to let me hold 
him. Soon, Prince. the furriest, fat-
test gerbil in the entire world, lay 
in my arms. Prince burrowed him-
self into my mom's expensive 
sweater and chewed hiS way 
through the fine threads. Perhaps 
it was because of my sense of 
euphoria from holding a creature 
so innocent and loving that [ did 
not notice how much time had 
passed until the employee asked 
me if [ wanted to let him go. 
Looking back, it might not have 
been the best decision to hold him 
for a linle while longer as my 
attachment grew and the quality of 
my mom's sweater decreased . 
(Prince seemed to have a taste for 
designer clothing.) 

Just a few moments earlier, I 
had been shopping the aisles for 
fish filters and now found myself at 
the register, purchasing bags of 
specialized pet litter (gerbils can 
get respiratory problems, so they 
need the best) and toys for Prince 
to play with. The final total was 
$120 (more than the two-mile 
range walkie-talkies [ wanted so 
bad), but [ did not flinch and 
quickly handed over my Visa card, 
thankful [ still had a few hours 
before my mom discovered my 
expensive purchase. 

The ride home ~as a tricky 
one. I was concerned before about 
driving too slow, but now I was 

When my roommlJte SIIW

expression on my flue 
lind II huge hllll of for in 
my IIrms, she s,m,.,lUd. I 
reillized this "'lIS a tmgic 
occurrence lIS I reCRJJed 
.the huge signs in the pet 
store billzing t¥Loud 
noises sCilre me!" around 
the gerbils. I braced 
myself for something 
terrible to happen. 
It did. 
concerned each bump and jolt 
would traumatize Prince. [ drove 
slowly, prompting more crazy soc-
cer moms in Caravans to flip me 
off. Even though [ thought [ had 
the situation under control, 
Prince managed to chew his way 
through his cardboard container 
and crawled dangerously close to 
the accelerator. After thirty min-
utes of dodging potholes and dri-
ving with one hand while holding 
Prince in the other, [ finally 
reached UCSD. 

As usual, [ could not find a 
parking spot, so [ did something 
that [ shouldn't have: [ parked iIIe-
sally, put my hazard lights on and 
In my excitement left the keys in 
the ignition with the windows 
down. After jumping over boulders 
and cracks in the sidewalk, [ finally 
reached my apartment and burst 
through the door. When my room-
mate saw me with a crazy expres-
sion on my face and a huge ball of 
fur in my arms. she screamed. I 

• 

realized this was a tragic occur-
rence as I recalled the huge signs in 
the pet store blazing "Loud noises 
scare mel- around the Fils. I 
braced myself for something terri-
ble to happen. 

It did. 
'Prince relieved himself on my 

mom's sweater and his waste 
dripped down onto the only pair of 
jeans I own. In the chaos that 
ensued, I managed to put Prince on 
my bed ( a bad, bad mistake) in the 
hopes that the 50ft comforter 
would provide him with warmth. 
Apparently, Prince thought this 
was a huge litter box instead, so he 
left lots of reminders of what he 
had consumed earlier in the day 
and also managed to pass gas. 
An\idst all of this. my logical room-
mate was pounding me with vari-
ous questions: What was I think-
ing? Was [ crazy? Did [ know that 
Prince relieved himself all over my 
only blank.et? Did I know it was 
illegal to house a rodent on cam-
pus? 

[ was ready to throw myself off 
the top of Geisel library, screaming 
"What did [ do?" all the way down. 
[ imagined the worst scenarios pos-
sible: animal control being called in 
by an anonymous caller (probably 
by my horror-stricken roommate) 
and Prince being whisked off to 
some animal shelter where he 
would have to use the same litter as 
the rest of the rodent family. There 
was also the possibility that my 
family would freeze my bank 
account, renderin~ me unable to 
purchase the speCial teething bark 
Prince needed to maintain opti-
mum dental health. 

[ realized the immensity of my 
mistake. It was not only arrogant to 
assume that I coWd simply hide 

• 

Prince in my room and expose my 
poor roommate to his flatulence. It 
was also irresponsible. I realized 
that I had broken the UCSD hous-
ing contract and become a crimi-
nal. What would I ten my kids years 
later when they asked me why I got 
kicked out of one of the best UC 
schools? How could I admit that I 
was an iUegal gerbil boarder? 

I felt guilty as well. I realized I 
was one of those irresponsible peo-
ple in Dear Abby around Easter 
who buys bunnies because they 
think they are cute but don't know 
how to take care of them. 

Realizing [ did not have the 
maturity or responsibility to take 
care of such a sweet·animal. [ knew 
[ had to take him back - and fast. 
Not bothering to clean off my 
sweater, I grabbed my roommate 
and Prince and headed back to 
PETCO, cemin that UCSD police 
were hot on my trail. When [ 
entered PETCO, the employee who 
sold Prince to me gave me a 
bemused kind of look and shook 
her head. [ was remorseful for 
wasting her time and for making 
such an impulsive decision, so [ did 
not bother to explain much. [ JUSt 
said [ could not take care of it and [ 
was very, very sorry. 

Saying goodbye to Prince was 
much harder for me to do. Not only 
did [ feel bad for giving him the 
false pretense of a secure home. [ 
also felt mad at myself for making 
such a rash decision. The only 

. thing [ could do was give him a kiss 
on his forehead and say I was sorry. 
[ noticed many people in the store 
give me curious glances. [ figure 
some things in life are too crazy to 
explain, so [ did not bother to tell

Property: 
Demand will overwhelm 
corporate influence 
C ....... II ......... 4 
below the level of this demand will 
only necessitate the future develop-
ment of illegal chaMels that will 
meet the ckmand. This is not open 
for discussion. It is a fact. Pmple 
have demonstrated their willing-
ness and ability to illegally meet 
their clernand for music. and they 
will continue to do so. Lawmakers 
and the recording industry can 
either fail to meet the ckmand and 
thus promote iUegal distribution, or 
they can face the (act that the 
Internet is something they can no 
longer suppress and simply deal 
with it. 

The large!lt and most influen-
tial businesses in the entertain-
ment, software and publishing 
industries can either fight against 
this new technology, or they can 
accept the fact that it is now 
unstoppable and try to adapt to 
the new order. 

On the one hand, if they choose 
to fight against it, they may manage 
to delay a major restructuring of 
the way intellectual property is 
treated In our society, but, 
inevitably, public demand will over-
whelm their ability to suppress the 
technology. 

The revolution will succeed, 
and they will be ruined when they 
fall victim to new companies that 
are willing to play by the new rules. 
On the other hand, if they embrace 
the new opponunities and 
demands for broadband media 
access, they can hdp shape the 
future of media in the information 
age and survive the transition. 

What will the new system of 
inteUectual pro~ broUlht on by 
the Internet look like 7 This ques-
tion is not easily answered, of 
course. It requires nothing short of 
a redefinition of the way our society 
treats infonnation. 

What does seem obvious is that 
the system of payment for intellec-
tual property will have to undergo 
radic81 changes if the owners are to 
be compensa1Ed, and, for the fore-
seeable future. they will have to be 
compensated if their respective 
industries are to be able to survive 
and continue producing. 

Howtm', if we are to extrapolate 
from the current system, it seems 
obvious that compensation will 
have to revolve around the means 
of distribution. Right now, the 
dominant form of distribution is 
still hard copies: Music listeners 
buy CDs. video consumers buy 
DVDs and literature fans buy 
books. 

This is a very simple method of 
monitoring compensation: Part of 
the proceeds from the purchase of 
a physical object go to the owner of 
the copyright. 

However, as the balance of dis-
tribution shifts from physical 
products to information transmit-
ted over the Internet, the ·check-
out stand" for intellectual proper-
ty will begin to shift to data net-
works. 

Service providers may have to 
begin monitoring the contents of 
information that their users are 
receiving to check whether the 
information they are downloading 
has been copyrighted. 

[f it has, the end user would be 
charged, and the service provider 
would transfer the money from 
the transaction to the copyright 
owner, regardless of who the 

The UCSD Guardian 

product is downloaded from. 
These transaction fees would like-
ly be much less than the cost of a 
physical CD or DVD. 
Nevertheless. the days of the free 
Internet are probably drawing to a 
close as society becomes more 
dependent on it. 

There are numerous advantages 
of gre<lter access to intellectual 
property, aside from the mere 
enttrtainment value of fret music 
and video. Public education costs 
could also be slashed. 

The yardstick of public educa-
tion has long been the number of 
new textbooks that a school pur-
chases. Moving away from expen-
sive printed books to electronic edi-
tions will cut textbook costs to a 
fraction of what they are now. 

Schools will merely subscribe to 
a textbook publisher's service and 
download updated editions as soon 
as they come out. Textbook pub-
lishers themselves will benefit from 
this system by virtually eliminating 
distribution costs for their elec-
tronic editions. 

Companies will have greater 
access to the latest software thanks 
to similar reductions in the distrib-
ution costs of electronic product 
acquisition. By separating the intel-
lectual content from the physical 
media, the money companies 
receive for their software or enter-
tainment media will be pure profit. 

The future of the Internet 
economy is hard to discern just 
yet, but it is becoming increasin~­
Iy obvious that it has very Iinle In 
common with the current system. 
Industries that are trying to cling 
to the old ways are only doing so 
in vain and will soon be buried in 
the flotsam of history if they do 
not learn to adapt.

Student Movement Emerges as Foe of Milosevic 
BELGRADE. Yugoslavia - A 

student movement demanding 
sweeping political change is surg-
ing in popularity and is now a sig-
nificant target for attack by the 
government of the Yugoslav presi-
dent, Siobodan Milosevic. 

The movement, called Otpor, 
or Resistance, has given fresh 
energy and an arrogant inno-
cence to Milosevic's political 
opposition. Otpor has not been 
shy about criticizing opposition 
leaders for their lack of unity and 
credibility. 

Loosely organized and without 
a clear leadership structure that 
could be subject to arrest, Otpor 
is intended to be difficult to 
repress. But it shows few signs of 
becoming a serious revolutionary 
organization. 

Still, government officials are 
attacking the group as "fascist 
hooligans" and "terrorists." The 
officials are giving strong signals 
that Otpor will be a prime target of 

- or at least the pretext for - a 
sweeping new law on terrorism 
that could be introduced as early 
as Monday. 

The law, said to be largely 
based on the emergency measures 

arrested at home in the early 
hours, questioned by the police for 
up to a day or more, threatened 
and sometimes beaten. 

"The regime senses the danger,

bombing war last year .. could pro-

or limitations, restricting the rights 
of the accused. 

Otpor srokesmen say more 
than 200 0 their members have 
been detained in the last week 
throughout Serbia. They are often 

thing else other than taking them 
down," said Milan Samardzic, 23, 
a law student with Otpor. "We're 
not in it for power or money, 
unlike many of the opposition 
politicians. We just want change. 
The idea of resistance itself is very 
powerful." 

Vukasin Petrovic, 23, a political 

science student and one of 
Otpor's steadily changing spokes-
men, says that about 25,000 peo-
ple have signed papers of various 
kinds to become members. even 
though there is no single member-
ship form, and that the organiza-
tion may be able to call on as 
many as 50,000 peo~le. 

More ask to jom every day, 
Petrovic says, "and we're getting a 
little overwhelmed. Things are 
moving at a very quick pace." 

Otpor started as a student 
response to a restrictive law on 
universities in October 1998. 
While many regard it as a move-
ment of arrogant rich youths from 
nice families, its surge in populari-
ty is a direct result of disappoint-
ment with this generation of polit-
icalleaders. who have failed during 
the last decade to bring down

Nuclear: 
Agnrement may not be 
shift in U.S. polig 
C ...... d,....,...l 

The five nuclear powers -
Britain, China, France, Russia and 
the United States - never consid-
ered setting a deadline for meeting 
this goal, and there are strong lob-
bies in every country arguing for 
retention of nuclear arms. 

Their pledge, brokered by a 
group of seven middle-level powers 
calling themselves the New Agenda 
Coalition, gives at least a psycho-
logical boost to flagging efforts to 
contain and abolish nuclear 
weapons, the aim of a 30-year-old 
treaty whose achievements and 
failures have been under review by 
the United Nations conference. 

A Clinton administration offi-
cial, who spoke on' condition that 
he not be identified, said Sunday 
night that the agreement did not 
represent a significant shift in 
United States policy. But the word-
ing of the document did mark a 
break with earlier public state-
ments. 

Until now, the United States 
and other nuclear-weapons nations 
have always insisted on qualifiers 
like the "eventual" elimination of 
arms. 

The final document pledges "an 
unequivocal undertaking by the 
nuclear-weapon states to accom-
plish the total elimination of their 
nuclear arsenals leading to nuclear 
disarmament to which all states 
parties are committed." 

Japan's chief negotiator, 
Ambassador Seiichiro Noboru. 
who has been active in a six-month 
campaign to put muscle in disar-
mament promises during this 
treaty review conference, was jubi-
lant. 

"It is happy news that we could 
get agreement for the first time 
without the infamous word 'ulti-
mate,'· he said in an interview at 
the end of a meeting on Thursday.

Michael Ovitt, superagent and 
former Disney president, has made 
his name - and a considerable 
fortune - aggressively securing 
hundreds of millions of dollars in 
royalties and other payments for 
artists and studios that he repre-
sents. His latest endeavor, however, 
a pop-culture hub on the World 
Wide Web, has the potential to 
drain income from some of those 
same clients by enabling users of 
the site to copy music, media and 
other files from one another. 

Last year, Ovitt and a business 
partner bought 51 percent of 
Scour. com, an entertainment site 
and search engine used to find 

_. music and movie files. Last 
month, though, the site added a 

feature, Scour Exchange. that lets 
users exchange multimedia files 
online with one another, includ-
ing copyrighted material by some 
of the world's leading artists, some 
of them clients of Ovitt's talent 
management agency. Artists 
Management Group. 

The involvement of Ovitt in 
Scour. com would seem to be at 
cross purposes with his role in 
Artists Management. But his back-
ing of Scour.com also marks a sig-
nificant shift in the roiling battle 
over copyright protection in the 
digital age. 

Until now, the archnemeses of 
the recording industry have been 
20-something entrepreneurs creat-
ing Web sites that make it easy to 

exchange copyrighted files over the 
Internet. 

Ovitt's backing for Scour.com's 
file-exchange mechanism suggests 
that opposition may be eroding to 
technology that, by many accounts, 
will force the development of new 
business models for the entertain-
ment industry, changing how artists 
are compensated for their work and 
how their work is protected. 

Ovitt declined to comment. 
James Ellis, however, general coun-
sel for Artists Management Group 
and a director of Scour Inc., said it 
makes more sense to embrace the 
technology than to fight it.

Thalidomide's Anti-Cancer Use Supported 
NEW ORLEANS - The early 

promise of thalidomide as an anti-
cancer dmg apparently is holding 
up, according to findings disclosed 
Sunday at a meeting of the American 
Society of Clinical Oncology. 

Thalidomide is the sedative that 
was banned worldwide after it 
maimed thousands of babies in the 
19605, mostly in Europe. Canada 
and Japan, when their mothers 
took it for morning sickness. Now 
thalidomide is being resurrected as 
part of the treatment for AIDS,lep-
rosy and some types of cancer. 

Last year, Dr. Bart Barlogie, an 
oncologist at the University of 
Arkansas, reported that thalido-
mide could slow the course of mul-
tiple myeloma among people who 
had failed to respond to standard 

. I ' •• t ., . , 

therapy. Multiple myeloma is a 
deadly cancer that damages the 
bone marrow and other organs. 

On Sunday, Barlogie told the 
meeting that his team had con-
firmed and extended the findin~ 
that thalidomide was effective an'd 
could be used safely with 
chemotherapy in a larger group of 
people with advanced multiple 
myeloma in the same study. 

Barlogie said thalidomide 
appeared to be the first new drug in 
three decades that had a beneficial 
effect on multiple myeloma. 

The new findings involve 169 
patients, nearly double the 89 cases 
that the Arkansas team reported on 
in the New England Journal of 
Medicine last year. All patients had 
received stem-cell transplants; 

about half had failed to respond to 
other drugs. 

Response to thalidomide, how-
ever, often occurred rapidly in 
these patients. After 25 months of 
thalidomide and other chemother-
apy, overall survival was 45 percent, 
and about 10 percent have not had 
a significant relapse, Barlogie said. 

He said he could not compare 
these figures with other treatments 
because a clinical trial of therapy in 
advanced multiple myeloma 
among patients who had had stem-
cell transplants had not been done 
previously. "An educated guess' 
was that most patients would have 
died in six months without thalido-
mide, Barlogie said.

-It is like saying, 'We don't want you here. Go

Associate Features Editor 

Thank you UeSD students. I 
am totally serious here. I would just 
like to thank each and every one of 
you from the bonom of my heart 
for showing me that you are not all 
a bunch of calculator-toting, rush-
ing-to-c1ass, anti-social "X-Files" 
fana tics. At least not all the time. 

I have to admit that when I first 
showed up here in La Jolla, I had 
my doubts. Yeah, Welcome Week 
was sweet. Everybody was in a good 
mood and was fairly social. 
However, once classes rolled 
around, it was as if everyone had 
turned into nerds overnight. I was 
very disappointed. 

I could see it beginning the 
night before classes. It was a 
Wednesday night, college night in 
TJ. and I wanted to grace our 
friendly neighbors south of the 
border with my presence. Try as I 
might, I could not find a single soul 
to accompany me on my journey. I 
ended up trekking down to Mexico 
all by my lonesome. It was not so 
bad, thou$h, consideting that I met 
a cab driver down there named 
Juan who split a bottJe of tequila 
with me on the way to a no-name 
bar in the middle of nowhere. (I do 
not remember much about that 
night except a bar fight and a near-
encounter with the Federales, but 
that is a whole different story). 

Throughout the school year, I 
have been asking myself repeatedly 
why I did not go to Santa Barbara, 
or even Davis (I know that most of 
you think that Davis is just a bunch 
of cows and pasture, but that is my 

point; what else are they going to 
do but party?). When I got here, I 
would walk around on weekends 
and see a dead campus. No life was 
to be found in this godforsaken 
place. 

I found myself going other 
places to have a good time - be it 
the beach, San Diego State or a 
random house party. I was just 
about on my last straw with this 
pathetic school when it happened: 
We gathered in masses to worship 
the great Sun God. 

Being from a college town, I 
pretty much knew what to expect 
from an all-campus party. This is 
why I had a goofy smile on my face 
for the week prior to the Sun God 
b :stival. Still, I was skeptical as to 
Low wild this campus would actu-
ally get. I had heard the stories 
from upperclassmen, but I had to 
see it with my own eyes to believe 
it. 

When the day actually arrived, I 
was astonished. It was lik.e nothing 
I had ever seen before. People 
became social. Girls became hot. 
Beer was flowing like water. It was 
my Mecca. 

As I journeyed through campus. 
I found that nearly everyone was 
carryinJ around a bottle that most 
certainly did not contain the liquid 
that it claimed on its label. I saw 
people drinking in c1ass, smoking 
joints like cigarettes for all to see 
and women nearly getting naked. I 
was impressed. 

After the unbelievable party . 
atmosphere during the day, it was 
hard to imagine UeSD getting

Joing to hold my breath. You can 
Imagine my surprise as I 
approached RIMAe field and saw 
the carnival-like atmosphere that 
awaited me. 

My eyes teared up a bit as ( saw 
the normally conservative mass of 
ueSD students running around 
like a scene from MAnimal House-
(sorry, but it was a speciaJ moment 
for me). I entered the dance floor 
and hopped into the middle of a 
group of drunken women who 

wereoo~~u~ingme~m 
their minds, dreaming of what 

would happen later in the evening. 
I continued to groove to the 

DJs' mixes (which kicked ass) until 
the Aquabats came out onto the 
stage. Pained by the horrible music 
protruding from the speakers. I bid 
my eager brothel adieu and ven-
tured over to the carnival section of 
the festival. 

It was quite amusing to watch 
the spectacle. Hordes of drunken 
students filed through obstacle 
courses. Surprisingly, I did not hear 
of any fatalities from drunken peo-
ple breaking their neclts. 

As I grew tired, I ventured over 
to the concessions area and sat 
down in the wet, white chan. I did 
not mind the soggy ass as two 
good~loo~ng girls soon sat on my 
lap. I was In heaven. 

I did check out our one Root for 
a while, who was not that bad. As 
soon as the so-called headliner, 
DishwaUa, took the stage. I took part 
in the mass exodus from the ficJd. 

UCSD kept surprising me, as 
the aftcrparties were just as good IS 
the daytime festivities. The beer 
continued to flow freely and the 
women were just as good-looking 
(probably more so now that ( had a 
substantial amount of alcohol in 
my system). 

Now, ( know from your faces 
Friday night that you were all 
enjoying yourselves. ( am here to 
teU you that the feeling you experi-
eneed during Sun God does not 
have to be a once-a-year thing. It 
can come every wc4end if you just 
open up your heart and let it in. 

Most cI the stu.dcnts here are 
probably operating under the f&IJc 
presumption that school and pmty-

ing do not mix. ( agree that it is total-
ly retarded to walk into class toting 
40 ounces of O.E. expecting to get a 
good grade. However, that does not 
mean you cannot let loose and have 
a~timeonme~n~ 

I know from experience you do 
not have to spend your entire time 
studying to do well in school. I am 
here, aren't I? 

My SATs are a}lerfect example 
of thIS theory. I showed up to my 
test totally unprepared and sport-
ing the worst hangover known to 
man. I had been up until 3 a.m. the 
previous night drinking with 
frien~ I still managed to rack up a 
semi-impressive 1330 (it would 
have been higher but I slept 
through almost half of a section). 
For those of you out there scoffing 
at my score, just imagine what I 
would have had if I had prepared as 
much IS you and not been nursing 
my hangover and lack of sleep. 

I am not saying you have to go 
out and get blitzed every weekend. 
What ( am saying is that you 
should not d:ePrive yourselves of 
the opportunities to have a good 
time that arc so abundant in col-
lege. This campus could (and in my 
opinion should) have me Sun God 
atmosphere about it for the entire 
year. Just think how much fun we 
could have in college. 

I urge you to stop wasting your 
weekends. (agree that studying is a 
good thing. ( am by no means 
advocating a total halt to studying. 
I do feel that it is imponant to find 
a balance bctwen the two, thoui\t. 
Please, if not for me. then do it lor 
yourselves. 

Oh yeah, thanks again UCSD.

Taking the show on the road 
Students get the opportunity for travel with education programs 
., JIIIICA ICIIIPPIIAMt 
Features Editor 

Perhaps one of the most mem-
orable experiences one will have 
in one's life is the opportunity to 
go to a foreign country. 

Staying in a foreign country 
not only allows a student to learn 
about that country's language 
and culture through "hands on" 
experience. It also broadens the 
scope of a student, not only 
intellectually but culturally. An 
experience abroad can multiply 
one's career options, build up 
resumes for those who have 
already decided on a career as 
well as build up the social skills 
needed in the professional world. 
Of course, other students just 
want to leave an area they have 
been in all their lives and go for 
the adventure. The incentives are 
countless for studying abroad, 
and pCSO's study and travel 
abroad programs give students 
this chance. 

Kim Burton, a director of trav-
el for the Programs Abroad Office, 
indicated that 258 students went 
to other countries through the 
Education Abroad Program in 
1998-1999, and 363 students who 
studied abroad through the 
Opportunities Abroad Program. 
For 2000-2001, Burton expects 
around 375 students to go abroad 
through EAP. The figure for OAP 
is still uncertain . 

There are two types of pro-
$rims abroad, EAP and OAP. EAP 
IS a systemwide study abroad pro-
gram that provides academic 
opportunities for UC students. 
On the other hand, OAP allows 

UCSO students to work, study 
and intern abroad with programs 
spoOlOred by other organizations 
or institutions outside the 
University of California system. 
Through these two descriptions, 
these programs might sound sim-
ilar, but they are completely differ-
ent options for UCSO students to 
choose from. 

EAP works closely with the UC 
system and is therefore affiliated 

Staying in a foreign 
country not onry allows a 
student to learn about 
that country's language 
and culture through 
Hhands on" experience. 
with more than 100 institutions in 
36 countries. This program is ori-
ented mainly toward students 
who want to study abroad. 
Participants earn UC credit and 
letter grades, provided that their 
chosen EAP courses are 
approved. Also, most programs 
require a 3.0 cumulative GPA at 
the time of departure. 

OAP is not associated with the 
UC system because it is run by 
private organizations not affiliated 
with the UC system, but it allows 
students to participate in a variety 
of abroad programs. OAP is for 
students who might want to work 
or intern in a foreign country. 
They can study there as well, but 
the general emphasis is on work-
ing. volunteering and interning. 
GPA eligibility varies by program. 

"There are a couple of different 
ways to get started: Burton said. 
·Students should definitely come 
(to the Programs Abroad Office1 
as early as possible, so we can pro-
vide information and begin to 
advise them. They can later do 
some research in UCSD's 
Programs Abroad Library." 

the Programs Abroad Library 
has information about study, 
work, internship and travel 
abroad opportunities. It is located 
in the UCSO Programs Abroad 
Office. which is in the 
International Center, on Library 
Walk across from Center Hall. 
Through the library, a student 
may find out about his or her 
interest in a certain country and 
see if the schedule for traveling 
abroad is optimal. 

For introductory study abroad 
information, Burton strongly rec-
ommends the Web sites 
www.goabroad.com and 
http://studyabroad.com. In addi-

. tion, there will be a Quest 
International Fair on Friday, Oct. 
20, 2000, with representatives 
who will explain the many 
options of studying and traveling 
abroad. Students should use 
Quest as a starting point for 
studying abroad. 

After deciding on a destina-
tion, one should choose either 
EAP or OAP. EAP requires that 
students fill out an application. 
Afterward, students write a state-
ment of purpose, turn in two let-
ters of recommendation and pro-
vide their transcripts.

This should be a good week to 

study. Learn how to bring in more 
money on Monday. Work with a 
team to solve a big problem on 
Thesday and WedneSday. Race 
around puttin~ out fires on 
Thursday and Fnday. You get more 
assertive and agile this weekend. 
Use new skills plus natural talents 
for extra income. Build a structure 
and follow a formula, and you 
could make a bundle. 

, .... (April 2O-May 20) 
Travel looks good on Monday, 

and other things should go well, 
too. Pay attention to business on 
Thesday and Wednesday. You 
might get a better job or sell some-
thing at a nice profit. A planned 
get-together on Thursday or Friday' 
may have to be postponed until 
Saturday due to illness. Do chores 
on Sunday. Your experience pays 
'off then, as a potentially difficult 
job takes yoy hardly any time at all.

You may feel like you have to 

hurry and get things done. Ooing 
that will be easier with a partner's 
help on Monday and Thesday. You 
and your mate could make an 
excellent deal on Wednesday and 
Thursday. Don't tell everybody 
what you're up to, however. Travel 
is complicated on Friday and 
Saturday, but you may decide to go 
anyway. Allow extra time. Play by 
every rule on Sunday, or your team 
could lose points.

On Monday get a lead on an

THINKING OF MOVING OFF-CAMPUS? 
HERE'S A STUDENT THAT DID ... 

NHello, my name is Brandon Foster, a 2nd year 
student at Warren. I realized I needed to start hunting 
around for a place to live, so I gave TOBIN a call. In 
short, Tobin hooked me up! Aher I had found a place 
that I liked, he fought off other bidders until the place 
was ours. Tobin helped me every step of the way. He 
came to my apartment and took the forms and 
delivered them to the appropriate places for me. So 
now I have this property, but I won't even need it 
until next year- not a problem! Tobin found renters 
immediately. The condo will be paying for itself until 
I am ready to move in. He is simply the best!"

an obligation to make gam~ p.lay 
interesting to the general pUblIC? 

My immediate reaction, and ~e 
opinion that I .still ~ave ~bout thiS 
ktnd of situation, IS thIS: Sports 
teams want to win. Making money 
for the networks is important to 
some extent, mainly because it pro-
motes the sport and makes it "?ore 
popular in gen~l, but th~ go~11S to 
win. Teams play 109 at thIS ome of 
year obviously know t~eir goal i~ to 
win and will do anything to achIeve 
it. For this reason I applaud the 
choice that Dunleavy made. 

As I said before. I think this was 
the wrong tactic. but Dunlea~ was 
doing what he thought gave hIS team 
the best chance to win, and for that. 
you have to give him props. It is seen 
all over in todays society, people 
going with the popular choice so ~ 
not to be scrutinized by the pubhc. 
Heck, Bill Clinton made it through 
eight years of the presidency by ~­
ning an opinion poll o~ ev~ tOpIC 
before he came out WIth hIS own 
opinion. Because of this, he has 
avoided public scrutiny but also 
made a mockery of what a represen-
tative government is supposed to be 
about If the general public could 
run the country, we would not need 
a president This same thing holds 
true for people holding leadership 
positions in spotts. 

Coaches are hired based upon 
their knowledge of the sport an.d 
ability to lead a team to a champI-
onship. They are not hired to. ~t 
the popularity of the tum (wlnntng 
will do that anyway), and they are 
not hired to boost the revenue of 
television networks. Because of this, 
the critiques of Dunleavy are com-
pletely unwarranted. 

If you want to bash Dunleavy 
publically, talk about the lack of 
strategy he used. Don't talk about 
how hIS team's poor play was not 
media-friendly. The measurement 
of success is how large the num-
ber in the ·W· column is under 
your leam's name, not how mu~h 
money television networks wl!1 
offer you to run your team s 
games.

Tadlock, who played consistently 
all weekend, came through with a 6-
1, 6-3 victory at No.4 singles. Liao 
lost at No. 5 singles, but Gunther 
won 6-4, 6-2 at the No. 6 spot. In 
doubles, the Tritons won at No. 1 and 
No. 3, but Ho and Liao lost 2-8 at 
No. 2 doubles in the match that 
proved to be the difference between a 
5-4 win and the 4-5 loss that actually 
occurred. 

"It was a great tournament, even 
though we didn't win: said women's 
tennis Head Coach Liz laPlante. "We 
put everything we had on the court, 
but it was tough losing in our last 
game of Division Ill. It was sad to see 
Yen Yen and Kirsten not 100 percent, 
but they fought hard and just came up 
short.· 

UCSD's performance in doubles 
was strong. lhmckino and Tadlock 
won at No.1 doubles while Olsen and 
Gunther won at No. 3 doubles. 
Unfortunately, the Thtons were able to 
muster only two wins in singles, by 
Tadlock and Gunther. Thnity domi-
nated the top three singles spo~ and 
also won in three sets at No. 5 stngles. 

Despite the disappointing I~s, the 
Tritons must be proud of theIr four 
national championships that they 
earned in their time in Division III. 
They .should also be proud of the two 
runner-up prizes that they hav.e 
earned in the past two seasons. If It 
continue to improve, UCSD will be a 
force to be reckoned with when they 
join Division II next season.

people better. Caroline was the cat-
alyst of the success of our team. 
She did a great job. She just worked 
so hard. I'm going to miss her. I'm 
going to miss her smile and her 
attitude. She got some key hits dur-
ing the year too." 

'A true measure of a player's 
worth to a team is how they affect 
the players around them. Based on 
that assessment, Andrade was one 
of the MVP's of the Thtons team 
this year. 

"[Andrade] made this past year a 
priority; Gerckens said. "She had 
her best offensive and defensive 
year. She helped us at first base. 
She made her teammates look 
good on several occasions because 
of plays that she made. People 
don't realize how important first 
base is. She had a calming effect on 
people. Offensively she came 
through with big hits.· 

There are many directions that 
t~ese players can take after gradua-
tion, and the graduating seniors on 
the softball team are taking various 
routes 

"I'm going to spend next year 
subbing at a school in the bay 
area: said Flannigan, an English 
literature major. "The next year 
I'm going to pursue a Master's or a 
Ph.D. Cal is my No. 1 option: 

Flannigan isn't the only one 
who wants to teach. 

"I'm going to SDSU to get my 

teaching credentials: said Engler, a 
human development major. "I'd 
like to teach second or third 
[gradel. Elementary school kids are 
awesome.· 

The other three Thton seniors 
are entering the job market after 
graduation. 

"I'm going to find a job and 
apply to some business schools, W 
Bridges said. "I'm going to pursue a 
coaching position, anywhere that 
will take me. I love softball and I 
think I would be good at it. I can't 
stay away from the game.w 

Softball may be a possibility for 
the others in the future as well. 

"I know that for the NCAAs it is 
not an option. There will be noth-
ing this year, but next year I'll be 
coaching in summer leagues and I 
may coach at the high school I'll be 
subbing for: Flannigan said. "I 
grew up with a father coaching me. 
When I was too old to play in the 
summer leagues, I started coaching 
with him. I liked it and plan to do it 
in the future. I've also been a pitch-
ing coach: 

Coaching seems to be a via.ble 
option for these graduates. 

"I'm thinking about coaChing a 
little league or a junior varsity 
team,w Engler said, "It depends on 
how state goes.. 

Looking back on how every-
thing got started, different reasons 
led these players to UCSD. 

"I saw the softball field and it 
was absolutely beautiful,· 
Flannigan said. "The campus is 
beautiful as well. I knew they had a 
good literature department and I 
like the five-college system. That 
sold me. I wanted to go somewhere 

The UCSD Guardian 

far, get out of the Bay Area: 
Flannigan isn't the only one 

who thought the campus is beauti-
ful. 

"The whole campus was beau-
tiful: said Sam, an animal physiol-
ogy and neuroscience major. "It 
just seemed right. I was mainly 

~oming (or academics. Softball 
wasn't something I was sure to do. 
I met the team, and I played ever 
since: 

For others, the softball team was 
the reason why some recruits came 
to UCSD. 

"It was a good school; Bridges 
said. "I could play softball. I love 
the campus. n 

A person can learn some impor-
tant lessons on an athletic team. 
For Engler, it was "definitely time 
management." 

"I tutored for a while, and I 
worked at RIMAC; Engler said. 
"It's very hard. I had to have a cal-
endar, a planner. I had to stick with 
it. 

This year ended with a trip to 
the playoffs after a two-year 
absence. 

"[We] would have had a better 
finish: Saru said, "But it was a 
good way to end the season. It was 
good. We knew we had much 
potential.w 

Still, the players have much to 
offer the new recruits. 

"It was so ~at,· Engler said. ") 
think we take It for granted coming 
in as freshman how hard it is to get 
to the playoffs. We made a point of 
explaining that to the new recruits 
how hard it is to get to the post sea-
son. Th~ just don't know how 
hard it is.

(n years past, the edition of the 
GUQTdian that comes out after Sun 
God always contained a column 
about a sports writer's expenences at 
the event. There is normally some-
thmg about dnnking and then walk-
109 around campus all day long, 
playing in the Inflatable jungle and 
looking at all the booths while not 
being sober enough to stand up. 

I am not gomg to give you that 
hiS year. Most of you were there and 

you saw how entertairung the events 
during the day were. Many of you 
t!xperienced the horror thaI was the 
un God concen, so I am n t going 
o rehash all those events. I can tell 
ou that in my intOxicated state, the 

outfits The Aquabats wore were 
~umorous, but Rahzel wore out hiS 

'elcome after about fiv minutes. 
Other than that, my memo of the 
enure event IS very shady, which tells 
me my misSion of complete mebria-
lion for the entire day was a suc~ess. 

What I want to talk about IS the 
"BA game I watched when ( was 
nursing my hangover on Saturday 
dltcrnoon. ( know in past editions of 

Reality Chec • ( have sworn off the 
, BA and its playoffs. but I made a 
pecial exception on this occasion 

because I needed somethmg to 
<;cothe my achmg head, and nothing 
else was on television. What ( saw 
was both entertaining and curious. 

Those of you who watched the 
game know that the Lakers were 
dominating going into the founh 
quarter. That is wnen Mike 
Dunleavy instructed his guys to foul 
Shaquille O'Neal every time the 
Lakers got the ball. This went on for 
about five minutes. Even when Shaq 
was nowhere near the ball, a 
Portland player would grab him and 
start yelling at the officials to blow 
the whistle. 

The first thing that went through 
my mind, and the minds of my 
hung-over mends watching the 
game with me. was, MWhat the hell 
are the Blazers doing?" Dunleavy 
defended his strategy afkr the game. 
saying that if the Blazers had shot 
the ball better, his ddmsive plan 
would have worked to perfection. 

In the NBA, teams average about 
nine-tenths of a point every time 
down the court, so fouling Shaq, 
who is about a 50 percent free throw 
shooter, will give them one point, on 
average. every time the Lakers have 
the ball. Because of this, Dunleavy's 
idea will not work very well in gener-
al . 

The more interesting question 
about this strategy is whether or not 
the Blazers have the right to employ 
it. Immediately after they began 
hacking Shaq, my friends, who are 
mostly Laker fans, belan swearing 
about how cheap the Blazers' strate-
'liJ was, and that the only reason that 
Dunleavy was trying such a thing 
was he did not feel that his team 
could win by conventional means. 
They were also complaining that the 
defensive tactic was not entertaining 
to watch. 

Obviously the networks do not 
look favorably on play styles that do 
not make for entertaining television. 
When fans get bored, they turn off 
the television , and when fans turn 
off the televiSion, the networks lose 
millions. This begs the question,

Heartbreaking Defeat 
After winning two matches in Minnesota, the Tritons fall 5-4 in the final of NCAA Nationals 
Staff Writer 

In its last appearance in 
Division III play, the women's ten-
nis team played 'Valiantly but 
ended one match short in the 
NCAA Division 111 Women's 
Tennis Championship at Gustavus 
Adolphus University in St. Paul, 
Minn. . 
. The Tritons finished their sea-

son with a 20-3 record and left 
Division III as one of the 
strongest squads in the nation. 
On May 19 in St. Paul, the team 
came out strong to claim a 6-3 
victory against Gustavus 
Adolphus College in the quaner-
finals. 

UCSD took four singles 
matches, including three-set victo-
ries by freshman Amy Thanckino 

and sophomore Lyndsey Tadlock. 
The doubles portion locked in the 
victory, winnmg two of the three 
matches. 

The Triton's success was no 
fluke, and they proved this in the 
match versus rival Amherst 
College on Saturday. In the previ-
ous meeting between these two 
schools, UCSD emerged with a 5-
4 triumph. 

This time around, lhmckino 
got the Thtons off to a great start, 
defeating Jamie Cohen of Amherst 
in three sets, :f..6, 6-0, 6-3. 

lhmckino's victory proved cru-
cial when Amherst won the 
matches at No.2, No. 3 and No.4 
singles. 1Wo of Amherst's wins 
were due to defaults by junior 
Kirsten Olsen and senior Yen Yen 
Ho. Melissa Liao and Rachel 
Gunther had clutch wi"\ defeat-

ing Amherst's Vas Kozoulina and 
Carolyn Pastel, respectively. 

with UCSD winning three sin-
~es matches and Amherst claim-
109 three as well, it all came down 
to the doubles portion of play. 
'Ii'anckino and Tadlock lost to 
Cohen and Paige Lawrence, set-
ting up the same scenario that 
occurred when the teams met on 
March 11. 

For UCSD to move on to the 
championship match, Ho and 
Liao, as well as Olsen and 
Gunther, needed to win their dou-
bles matches. Ho and Liao had a 
close win, taking the match 9-8. In 
the final match, Olsen and 
Gunther pushed hard to pull 
through In their match 9-7. 
History repeated itself. This victo-
ry secumf a spot in the national 
championship match against 

Trinity University on Sunday. 
The national championship 

match proved to be as thrilling as 
the numbers indicate. Thnity came 
into this match with a 21-2 record, 
almost identical to UCSD's 20-2 
mark. Trinity was seeded No. 1 in 
the western region; UCSD held 
the No.2 spot. Like UCSD, Thnity 
was well-known for its depth in 
both singles and doubles play. 
This match had the making of an 
epic final. 

UCSD was hampered with 
injuries coming into the match, 
Ho suffered a leg injury and Olsen 
sufkred a pu\lcd groin. The team 
was not up to its usual form, and 
that contributed to the loss. The 
Tritons lost at the top three singles 
spots, all in straight sets. 

Softball Loses Five Seniors to Graduation 
Andrade, Bridges, Flannigan, Sam and Engler will all graduate from UCSD in June 
Sports Editor 

Every year a new group of 
seniors earn passage to the future 
through graduation. 

This- holds true for five mem-
bers of the UCSD softball squad 
this year. 

Natalie Andrade, Erin Bridges, 
Erin Flannigan, Cynthia Sam and 
Caroline Engler are all wrapping 
up their Thton careers this June 
and the team is losing something 
special with each player. 

M[Flanniganl brought such a 
gr~~ work ethic that she was a 
role model," softball head coach 
Patti Gerckens said. "She was a 
work horse. She was out there ear-
lier than everybody to pitch 
because when you're a pitcher you 
have to put in more time. She was 
always ready to have balls hit to 

her and ready for live pitching to 
the team. She brought a certain 
security. They looked to her for a 
lot of guidance too. She did a great 
job for us, pitchins-wise. During 
her senior year she Improved a lot. 
She worked really hard." 

Gerkens also comment-
ed on Flannigan's self-
lessness. In Regionals, 
Gerkens decided to 
pitch ace Leea 
Harlan in all four 
games. Flannigan gra-
ciously stepped aside 
and accepted her coach's 
decision because it would benefit 
the team's chances to win. 

Bridges has $amered a number 
of honors dunng her tenure at 
UCSD. She was inducted to the 
All-West Region team all four 
years of her career and was a first-
team selection this year. Bridges 

was also selected as a third-team 
All-American last year. 

"[Bridgesl dominated for four 
. years," Gcrckens said. MHer senior 

year was her best year ever. She led 
the team in hits. batting average, 

on base percentage and her 
fieldin~ was tremendous. 

Playtn~ at the shorutop 
posinon, you're going 

to get a lot of balls 
and she had a phe-

nomenal season 
there. She was a field 

captain out there." 
Sometimes a 

love for softball is equally impor- . 
tant as skillful play. Sam is an 
example of a player with both. 

"(Sam) had so much passion 
for the game ever since her fresh-
man year," Gerckens said. ·She 
came in and was ready to work 
hard. We changed her from a 

right-handed hitter to a left-hand-
ed hitter, which not everybody can 
do. We utilized her speed and she 
did everything I asked. She did it 
willingly. Center field can be really 
hard, but she had such presence 
out there. She was an inspiration 
for a lot of people." 

Engler was a player who came 
in with raw talent her freshman 
year, and through hard work, blos-
somed into a cOl)tributing factor 
on the team. 

M [Engler! has improved so 
much from her freshman year," 
Gerckens said. MShe worked hard. 
Her work ethic was tremendous. 
She would get down on herself, 
but she knew how to pick herself 
up and make herself better and 
make others better. More Impor-
tantly, she improved and made
