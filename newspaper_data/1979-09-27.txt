NASA Claims 'Discrimination,' 
Th~eatens to Sue University 

according to EOP hei KI William Byrd . By Sam Gooch 
Staff Writer 

The NHtive American Student Alliance is considering 
bringing suit against UCSD for failure to provide 
adequate representation of American Indians in all 
phases of campus operations, UCSD NASA 
representatives said yesterday. 

The complaint sterns from enrollment figures showing 
' onLy three new Native American students out of seven 
applicants admitted to UCSI) this fall. 'That number is 
highly disproportionate to tht:: Indian population in San 
Dit::go county," Morro~v said. 

"We're being cheated by the university as a whole, '" 
said Hill Morrow of NASA . 

According to Byrd . who does the final hiring of EOP 
recruitmt::nt personnel, most of tht:: selection process is out 
of his hands . "Out of 175 initial Clpplicants, three names 
were submitted to me for a final decision by the screening 
committet' ." he said. "None of them were American 
Indianl> .'· 

According to Morrow , a recent complaint aimed at the 
Educational Opportunity Program for fai lure to hire a 
replacement for Native American recruiter Russell 
Murphy, has stirred long slumbering feelings against the 
university. 

Murphy, who resigned last spring because of personal 
difficulties, ' was the only American Indian 'on tht:: EOP 
recrui ting committ~e. 

Tht:: [OP vacancy was filled by a Puerto Rican and a 
current openin~ is expectt::d to be tak~n bv a black female, 

Tht' screening committee, madt:: up of s tudents, faculty 
ilnd staff from various ethnic backgrounds. goes through 
a complex formal procedure to narrow down the 
applicants I>t:'fore submitting final choi 'es to Byrd. 
"There were four of fi ve Indian applicants of the initial 
175." Morro\\' said. PI.- by MoIthow GWI

Colleges, Ad'm'n Allocate 
Vending Income,Set Procedures 

By Pat Domowitz 
Staff Writer 

A substantial portion of campus wide 
vending machine revenue has officially been 
returned to the collegeS and student councils by 
a n agreement ratified last week. 

The agreem,!::nt, detailed in a .memo from 
Vice Chancellor for Administration Bernard 
Sisc'o, provides $25,000 this year to the 
colleges and graduate student council. It also 
would allocate the net receipts fr om vending 
machines located in the Student Center to the 
Student Center Board. 

These fundli were traditionally given to 
student councilli and colleges for programming. 
However. Chancellor William Mc Elroy 
diverted those funds to help defray a large 
Housing and Food Services office debt , 
sparking a student boycott last spring and 
McElroy's reconsideration of the reallocation . 

The current proposal is a variation on 

TODA V'S WEATHER 
Sunny skies Thursd<lY and Friday after patchy 
morning cloudiness. Temperatures will be in the 
mid· 70s wilh winds of 1 ()· IS mph. 

'Iht, sllrf will he ] ·4 ft:'t:'t at 12 second 
inh:rvals. Tht· watt'r tempt.'rature is 66 dt:'Wt't·s. 

McElroy 's plan - including the originally 
proposed first year allocation, but expanding on 
the inflation-incrt::ase allowance. 

Under the ratified plan, first year allocalions 
to the colleges and GSC would dividt: a 
$25,000 vending machint: fund. lhe allocation 
for 1980-81 would jump to $30.000. 

Beginning July I, 1981 , ~he minimum 
annual allocation of $30,000'wili be incrt:ased 
by 50 percent of the difference between the net 
income for the preceding fiscal year (1980.81 ) 
and the net income earned during the base year 
( 1979-80). 

According to Sisco's memo, this formula for 
additional income will continue "indefin.i tely ." 
Student representatives will meet annually to 
determine the base and formula to I)t: used in 
distributing the funds to the coleges and council. 
"Ihis year's meeting will be held Friday. Del. 
19. 

The ' only dissenting vote to the 
undergraduate ratification came frolll Third 
Oean Bev Varga, according to AS President 
Carlos Montalvo. 

"She felt that Third College will gd even less 
money under this plan than it has in the past," 
he said Wednesday. "But." he said. "thert' 
seems to be a question as to whether that is a 
result of the vending mal·hint: action."

'Ghost Profs' Haunt 
Offices of Saltman, 
Academic Departments 

There are faculty members on campus no one will ever St:e. 
They aon t exist. 

These non-existent professors are actually unfilled fuJl·timt: 
proft:ssorships which art: u~ as cushions to give each. 
departmeRt - Oexihilityo to ' appoint faculty where the need is 
grt:atest. . 

Dr, Murray Goodman, head of the chemistry department, says 
that in addition to providing departments with flexibility, the 
empty profesorships "give experience for the young," who have to 
fill these spots temporarily. The system "doesn't lock us in" whilt: 
persuing the goals. of the department. he says. 

There are prellently Ot:le full and two temporary professorships 
open in the chemistry department, and these positions will be filled 
according to the needs of the student body, according to 
Goodman. 

The Political Science department used its positions to incrt:ase 
its size by over 50 pe~cent last year, expanding from ' nine 
to 14 prC?fessors. 

And Dr. Sanford Lakoff, department chairman, says he is 
anxiouli to fill the three remaining ghost positions in the 
department's weakest areas: constitutional law, politicaltht:~ry 
and urban politics. 

Literature department chairman Dr. James Lyon says the 
department has four current full -time openings. 

If these positions are not filled by the end of this year, the money 
in th~ budl{ets will return to what is called "Salary Savinl{s. "

He Wishes Hut Wouldn't .Close 
Editor: ' 

, I was disirt=ssed to It:arn that 
the Coftee Hut will close down 
for good at the end of thi~ 
quarter. Can anything be done 
t()l save it? In my opinion, ita 
demise represents a singular 
loas for this campus. The Hut 
has been one of those precious 
institutions·within· institutioni 
that buttress in a real, if 
modest, way the true miasion 
of the university. We have all 
too few of them at UCSD. 

Is there any place else here 
where there are more natural 
and frequent contacts between 
professors, students and staff? 
I know of nothing outside the 
formal· dassroom or lab that 
compares wi'th the Hut a. a 
setting for social and 
intellectual interaction 
between those otherwise 
rather stratified elements of 
our community. Where else 
may you see a senior faculty 
member from one discipline 
casually sit doWn with a junior 

from another, later to be joined 
by a student or two and 
poasibly a staff member? I've 
often observed that in the 
ensuing conversations some of 
the barriers imposed by 
specialization may be 
broached. Fruitful com· 
munication takes place. 

I am a librarian, and many 
ideas that led directly to 
significant improvements in 
library service and collections 
have found their origins in the 
free and e8:lY informality of a 
Coffee Hut luncheon 
discullion. The Hut'. 
environment lends itself to that 
sort of thing. 

I have been eating at the 
Hut fairly regularly for years . 
Not only do I find its quiet and 
sylvan surroundings pleas. 
antly conducive to the 
experiences noted above, but I 
also find it a very comfortable 
place to bril)g guests or eat 
alone. It can be said that other 
restaurants and meeting 
places can readily fulfill the 

Intern Explains Student 
Health Insurance Changes 
Editor: 

I am writing in an attempt to 
resolve some confusion 
generated by Kathy Huffer's 
article on health insurance at 
UCSD. 

Until this academic yt:ar, a 
mandatory insurance program 
was purchased for each 
student directly by registration 
fees. This year, UCSD was 
unable to receive a feasible bid 
to contract a mandatory 
insurance program. This was 
attributed to continual 
financial loases that insurance 
carriers had incurred as a 
result of contracting with 
UCSD during the past several 
years. It is this situation that 
has left UCSD students 
without automatic health 
insurance coverage. 

In an efforf to deal with this 
problem and minimize the 
ijnancial burden of student's 
medical coats, an External 
Medical Account (EMA) has 
been funded by the registration 
fee committee. The EMA is 
not an insurance program but 
will provide direct payment for 
the expenses of essential acute 
outpatient services that are not 
available at the Student 
Health Center. This includes 
specialist consultations, 
various lab telta. aDd 
emergency care: not leading to 
ho.pitalization. These 
expenses will be paid as 

necessary when the student 
has obtained referral for 
outside Service by the Student 
Health Center . 

The university has also 
contracted a health insurance 
program that students may 
purchase . The insurance 
policy, underwritten by 
Occidental Life Insurance 
Co., is offered on a quarterly 
basis with premiums of 
$34.25 per student and $44 
each for spouses and children. 
'Iht: program wali dt=siMnt::d 1'0 
supplement the service. 
available at the Student 
Health Center and basically 
offers hospitalization, surgery, 
outpatient care outside of the 
county and major medical 

' coverage. Insurance claims 
should be filed directly with 
Occidental since there will be 
no in.urance representative on 
campus except during 
enrolltnent periods. 

Claim forms will be 
available in the Office of the 
Student Health Advisory 
Committee located in the 
Student Health Center. The 
insurance is on sale now and 
wal continue to be sold from 9 
am to 2 pm in the Student 
Health Center mtil' the final 
enrollment date of Nov. 1,

but probably not. How many

obviously designed for such

rarely used? Also, I simply 
don't find the same character

in the other dining ' facilities 
now operating. The amenities 
that many like myself find at 
the Hut are all too rare. They 
should be relinquished with 
reluctance. 

Yea, I have heard that the 
Hut has lost money the pilat 
two years. I readily admit that 
financial 1«igers are the kind 
of books I find hard to read. 
But I have also heard that 
every other beanery here haa 
also loat money excppt for the 
Revelle deli. With lOme effort 
and planning, I believe that the 
Hut's loases could be reversed. 

When many students last 
year opposed converting the 
Hui into a faculty dub, they 
did so l>tcallst! tht:y wished 
the Hut preserved - not 
converted into o(fices. They 
were right then and they are 
right now. To paraphrase 
Holly Holmes, my mind is 
made up and my money is on 
the Hut! .

Carter May Intervene ' Canal Bill Passes 

UNITED NATIONS· ~resident Carter may step 
into the flagging US Soviet negotiations over Russian 
troops in Cuba, US sources said today. 

Presidential intervention will depend heavily on 
the outcome of Secretary of State Cyrus R. Vance's 
session tomorrow with Soviet For.eign Minister 
Andrei A. Gromyko. 

The US sources who asked not to be identified, 
said there is no basis yet for expecting a settlement of 
the dispute over the 2,000 to 3,000 troops. The 
United States insists they form a combat brigade 
while the Soviets say the troops have been on a 
training mission in Cuba for years. 

Carter has meetings scheduled in Washington this 
weekend with Mexican President Jose Lopez 
Portillo, and Gromyko is scheduled to fly home to 
Moscow this Friday. 

Bokassa a 'Cannibal' 
BANGUI, Central African ,Republic -

Ousted Emperor Jean Bokassa dined on the flesh of 
the citizens he put to death and slept on a $13 million 
solid·gold bed, the new president of the African 
nation has told a news conference. 

The new president said Bokassa. now in exile in 
the Ivory Coast. was a cannibal. 

President David Dacko. who is Bokassa's cousin. 
confirmed earlier reports that three bodies, each with 
parts missing and supposedly eaten, have been found 
in refrigera tors at one of the deposed dictator's villas. 
Anotht:r body was found nearby in a hastily dug 
gra ve, 

"Y t!S. Ihere were pieces of flesh, human flesh in the 
deep freeze at Bokassa's home, " said Dacko. who 
with French i:lssistance staged the coup last week that 
drove Bo.kasSil from his 2 .8·ton bronze throne . 

WASHINGTON-Facing a deadline only days 
away, the House gave Congress'iinal approval today 
to legislation carrying out the Panama Canal treatiel. 

The House passed the bill, 232·188. The Senate 
had approved it yesterday, 63·32, 

Without the legislation, there would be no US-
controlled commission to take over operations of the 
canal Monday and run it Until Panama gets the 
waterway under the treaties Dec.31, 1999. , 

President Carler and some of his top aides lobbied 
hard for the vote. . 

House opponents won some concessions in the 
new version, however. 
. For one thing, the House won a provision to bar 
the president from turning the canal over to Panama 
before the treaty expires at the end of the century. 
Some had contended that the bill rejected last week .-
would have allowed Carter to surrender the canal 
hefore he left office . 

Brown an Also Ran? 
MANCHESTER,NH - Gov. Brown's top 
campaign aide says Brown will lose the New 
Hampshire primary to Massachusetts Sen. Edward 
Kennedy, but Brown last night said he hasn't 
conceded the race here. 

. Tom Quinn, chairman of Brown's committee to 
explore a presidential nomination, told reporters 
yesterday that Kennedy will sweep the nation's 
earliest primary and that Brown's come·from·behind 
bid for the presidency hinges on placing second in 
New Hampshire. ' 

"Our goal is to finish in second place and make this 
a two·person race between Kennedy and Brown" 
Quinn eaid. '

an Oakland prostitute. 

Tom Orloff said he would recommend dropping 
the case, but the final decision res Is' with Alameda 
County District Attorney Lowdl Jensen. The matter 
was to be resolved at a court hearing tomorrow. 

A mistrial was declared yesterday when jurorltold 
Superior Court Judge Donald P. McCullum they

efforts , but singled out Ann Ishihara, Elaine Bergman and Lori 
Melvin as the outstanding players of the evening. 

In game one, UCSJ) ,..-----------....., 
grabbed a 4-2 lead thanks to The DaiJy Guardian _ 
some errant serving by their 
opponents. Cal Lutheran did 
ma nage to break UCSD's 
second serve and had the 
opportunity t~ gel back into Sports 
the game. But an allempted Thursday, Sept. 27, 1979 Cal Lutheran spike was '--_________ _ 
blocked by BeY!.,1J1lan . 

Ishihara then took the serve for .he Tritons and reeled off six 
straight points. pulling Cal Lutheran out of the game. . 

The second game was all UCSD. Cal Luthera n scored its four 
points on four different services. Sandwiched between these points 

. were strings of four a nd five points by the UCSLJ women. Freshman 
Lori Melvin spa rkled in this game, winning several points with 
spikes and assisting in other scores with sels and blocks up front.

a slow start, falling behind 3-1, the UCSD women shifted into 
overdrive . and found themselves shaking ha nds with the Cal 
Lutheran women 10 minutes .later.

Marijuana 
('onlinucel from {I<'I-!l' J 
"critical incr~as~ in th~ usage 01 marijuana 
among young pt:ople," Beard daims. 

Facts rev~aled in th~ marijuana hearings 
have influenced leading physicians to shih their 
position on th~ issu~ of the potency of 
marijuana, said Beard, a member of the 
Narcotics Committee. lne change in the kinds 
of marijuana used in the country is also 
contributing to this shift. Physicians now see 
marijuana as potentially harmful, Beard says. 

Marijuana used in the '60s was mostly either 
wild or from Mexico, and both varieties contain 
It!ss than one pt:rcent of THC, the active agent 
in marijuana. In the '70s, people arc not only 
smoking marijuana on a more regular basis, but 
it now wmes from Colombia or Thailand, or is 
home grown with THC conteht up to 10 
pt:rcent, testimony before the committee 
showed. 

THE MOST HILARIOUS 
WILDEST MOVIE 

IS HERE! 

The Daily Guardian 

Smoking marijuana scvt'ral times or more 
weekly alfeds the reproductive ability of men 
and women on Cl long terlll hasis. Dr. Gabriel 
Nahas of the National Institut on Drug- Abusc 
told the committee. 

It inhibi ts male sDermato1!enesis and 
interferes with the female menstrual cyd~ to the 
point thai ovulation dOt:s nol regularly occur, hI:' 
said. 

However, THC was Ihe focu~ of the 
institute's research. Doses 01 THC equivalt!l1t 
to doses used in human consumption were 
administered to. rodents orally or by inhalation . 
"Human consumption" was calculated to be 
between five and 2S milligrams of THC pt!r 
kilogram of body weight , Nahas said. 

Unlike water soluble alcohol, continued 
Nahas, THC is lat soluble and is retained by the 
body's fat tissues. Nahas t;mphasized the 
danger of a high accumulation of THC in the 
body since "a 'ingle dose of THC takes 30 
days to be eliminated" from the system, he said. 

THC also affects the formation of 
chromosomal protein.s and growth hormones,

"We're not saying thai Ihl'

unfair," Morrow said, "but the 
point is, there were no Native

" W~ ha ve funded a

students who wish to actively 
participate in the recruiting of
