The UCSD 

Soviet Official Discusses the 
'Lessons of the Cold War' 
By Melinda Hamilton 
Associate News Editor 

Suggesting that Middle-Eastern 
strongman Saddam Hussein might 
have had an easier time were it not for 
the Ie sening of superpower tensions, 
a Soviet official discussed the "les-
sons of the Cold War" on campus 
Monday. 

Sergey Plekhanov, deputy direc-
tor of the Soviet Union's Institute for 
the Study of the United States of 
America and Canada, spoke to an 
assembly of tudents, faculty, and 
community members Monday at the 
Graduate School of International Re-
lations and Pacific Studies. 

Plekhanov said that rather than 
leamingfrom the cold war, propleare 
adopting more of a relieved attitude 
now that it is over. . 

' 'Talking about the lessons of the 
cold war may not strike people as a 
very interesting or relevant topic," 
Plekhanov said 

'The danger is that if we try to just 
forget about it all too quickly ... we 
really might repeat some of the mis-
takes and might not use some of the 
new opportunities that are opening up. 
The results could be very dangerous." 

Plekhanov's view on the Middle 
Eastconflict is that thesanctions should 
begiventirneto work, andforceshould 
be used only as a last resort. 

He suggested that ifSaddam Hus-
sein had taken the same action five 
years earlier, before the endofthe cold 
war, he would have had an easier time 
because the geopolitical politics kept 

the other nations from banding to-
gether in the same way. 

"International opposition would 
have been stuck between geopolitical 
and ideological considerations of the 
two sides," Plekhanov said. 

He spoke of the United Nations as 
a body that is "finally corning into its 
own" as an international peacekeep-
ing organization. 

"It turns out that the United Na-
tions can be an effective mechanism 
against aggression. That's what it was 
created for, but it has never been used 
for [that purpose]," Plekhanov said 

Plekhanov said he was shocked to 
learn that the value of a Soviet diplo-
mat to the UN was measured by the 
number of United States-backed reso-
lutions he helped to defeat. 

"But I was even more surprised 
when I talked about it with a veteran 
American diplomat who said, 'Well, 
it was the same on our side,' " he said. 

"That's a tragic thing because the 
United Nations was not created ... to 
be a battleground between two coun-
tries. It was created for building [a] 
peaceful andstable world,"Plekhanov 
said. 

Plekhanov said he sees the biggest 
problem facing the SovLt Union to-
day as being the implementation of a 
new ecomonic system. 

'The new way need a chance to 
work,"hecormnented,addingthatan 
alliance between Soviet President 
Mikhail Gorbachev and President of 
the Russian Republic Boris Yeltsin 
would greatly help matters. 

According to Plekhanov, there has 
been a fundamental shift in the nature 
of international power in the past few 
decades. 
. " In the first halfofthi century, the 

currency of powerwas tenitory, arms, 
and a strong state," he said. ''Those 
countries who could mobilize these 
three factors would be more powerful 
and have greater influen e. 

"Butthen,thosewhoputtheirstate 
in this currency would inevitably lose," 
he added. 

The new currency of power, ac-
cording to Plekhanov, deals with the 
ability to create incentives for people 
to worl<. hard. 

'The fact that the twentieth cen-
tury turned out to be the century of the 
military tate is a great tragedy. But if 
we learn the right lessons... if we 
demilitarize international politics, it i. 
not too late," he said. 

'The new passwords to the inter-
national power in this world have to do 
with things like democracy, social 
responsiblityand ocialju tice ... and 
ecological rehabilitation," Plekhanov 
said. 

He added that Russia is asharnedto 
compare itself with western countries 
because there are discrepancies like 
the fact that there are more military 
planes than civilian planes in the S<r 
viet Union. 

"Military power must be converted 
into a new cwrency of power. We 
have too much hardware that we do 
not know how to use," Plekhanov 
said.

UCSD, MCI Announce 
New Fiber-optic Link 
• Supercomputer center to benefit 

A five-year, multi-million dollar 
agreement to install a fiber-optic 
system for advanced telecommuni-
cations has been signed by UCSD 
and the MCI Communications 
Corporation. 

The agreement calls for enhanc-
ing a link to the San Diego 
Supercomputer Center (SDSC) with 
the National Science Foundation 
Networl<. (NSFN), the nation's larg-
est research and education computer 
networl<.. 

The fiber system will have a ca-
pacity of 405 megabits, according 
to UCSD officials. The system is 
expected to be operational by the 
end of 1990. 

"State-of-the-art telecommuni-
cations is fundamental to an out-
standing re earch university," 
UCSD Vice Chan ellor for Bu i-
ne Affairs Steven Releya aid. 
" It ' imply one oftho e thing you 
have to be [in order to be] a quality 
fa ility."

access to the SOSC's Advanced 
Scientific Visualization Laboratory, 
where scientists create three-di-
mensional , computer-generated 
models of complex natural phe-
nomena. 

By increa ing telecommunica-
tions speed, scientists will be al-
lowed to tackle a variety of prob-
lems requiring intense calculations, 
from the simulation of atmospheric 
and oceanographic conditions 
needed to predict long-range cli-

Vigil Held to Protest Violations of 
Human Rights in Occupied Kuwait 

LOS ANGELES - A candlelight vigil was held in 
Westwood on Nov. I to commemorate the third month of 
Iraq 's invasion of Kuwait. 

Approximately 50 people gathered at Westwood's 
Federal Building and listened to speaken; from Amnesty 
International, the Los Angeles Coalition Against U.S. 
Intervention in the Middle East, and the Kuwait American 
Friendship Council as they talked of how the invasion has 
led to rampaot human-rights violations in the Middle East. 

Vigil participants read sections of the United Nations 
Declaration of Human Rights, and a Kuwaiti student read 
a passage from the Koran. Participants also sang "Let 
There Be Peace On Earth (Let It Begin With Me):' 

"Basically, this vigil was to get people together to 
SUPPOll each other," said Adnan Alsaleh, president of the 
Kuwait American Friendship Council. 

The rally was organized by Stacey Carpenter, whose 
Kuwaiti husband remains in the occupied territory. Ac-
cording to Carpenter, many people in Kuwait had origi-
nally left other nations such as Jordan and Iran to escape 
the governments or to find worle.

Nov. 3 conference to have such a high level of tension between 
students and administraton;. 

"Administrators serve a useful purpose in explaining their 
positions, but they 're here to hear what we (students] have to 
say," KyseJla aid. 

In the session on campus climate, which can be described 
as how students feel they are treated by the university or 
college, students questioned the work of the California 
Po t econdary Education Committee (CPEe). 

Penny Edgell. educational equality coordinator for the 
CPEC, saidlhat the committee was not created to deal with the 
issue of differential treatment directly, but rather to directly 
examine the feasibility of studying the issue at California 
colleges and univen;ities. 

According to Edgert, CPEC surveyed 480 students, fac-
ulty. and staff in eight state campuses for the feasibility study, 
but it needs a econd piece of legislation to do the actual 
differential treatment study. 

Srudeot,s attending the conference questioned CPEe's 
method of polling only 480 people in a school that enrolls 
150,000 students system-wide. . 

Patricia Romero, UC spokeswoman on student services, 
said that a tudy of differential treatment released this summer 
by the UC revealed what programs were available for stu-
dents, butdid not point out which programs were or were not 
effective. She said a UC-wide task force on differential 
treatment is necessary before any action can be taken. 

UC Berkeley Professors Asked to 
Testify at State Hearing on Tenure 

BERKELEY - Three professors denied tenure by the UC 
testified at a state hearing that examined hiring, tenure, and 
promotion practices at California public universities. 

Professors Marcy Li Wang, Jenny Harrison, and Joel 
G:rrcia were among 29 witnesses who testified on Oct. 30 at 
the C)an rancisco Board of Supervisors Chambers. 

"Ql.estionable hiring, promotion, and tenure actions occur 
at our tax-supported colleges," said Teresa Hughes, chair of 
the Assembly Education Committee. 

Jesus Mena, a univen;ity spokesperson, said the university 
"is ready to talk honestly and frankly about the whole issue of 
hiring and tenure practices." 

He stressed that the university believes its Fractices are fair 
and cited the diversity of newly-hired professors. 

Of the 76 professors brought to UC Berkeley this year, 25 
percent are ethnic minorities and 26 percent are women, Mena 
said. 

John Perez, UC Berkeley's associated students' affuma-
tiveaction coordinator, said fairness in hiring practices will be

one of the key issues (argeted at the hearing. 
"None of the (academic) departments at Berkeley have 

proactive affirmative action plans designed to increase 
representation," he said. 

Wang charged that the university must admit the 
failings of its practices before the tenure process can be 
improved. 

"As long as there is secrecy and covering up, al1l1 denial 
that there are problems, there will never be solutions to 
those problems and flaws in the system," Wang said. 

SATs Modified to Include Essay 
Writing, More Text Analysis 

BERKELEY - The College Board of Trustees, the 
g.roup responsible for producing the Scholastic Aptitude 
Test, announced majorcbanges to the 64-year-old exam to 
reflect the recommendations of a report issued by UC 
Presideot David Gardner and Harvard University Presi-
dent Derek Bok. 

The SAT is used by colleges across the United States in 
the admissions process as ameansofpredicting a student 's 
performance in college. 

"I applaud the College Board for undertaking these 
major initiatives intended to improve the quality of Ameri-
can education and the fairness and significance of its 
varied testing and guidance program," Gardner said. 

The New Possibilities Commission, which is co-chaired 
by Bok and Gardner, issued the report in conjunction with 
the announcement of the reforms. 

The College Board adopted most of the reforms recom-
mended by the commission, which demanded that the 
exam test a more wide-ranging set of academic skills and 
pay attention to the needs of an increasingly diverse 
student population. 

The standardized test has been criticized for having a 
racial, gender, and class bias. White males have typically 
scored higher on the test than minorities and females. 

The modifications will produce two SATs, the SAT-1 
and the SAT-n. The SAT-I will mirror the SAT format 
familiar Lo many college students. The verbal portion of 
the test will feature increased emphasis on text analysis, 
with half the exam devoted to long critical reading pas-
sages. Antonyms will be dropped, while analogies and 
sentence-based questions will continue to be used. 

The SAT-II consists of a banery of tests, including the 
Achievement Tests, and will exanline specific areas of 
knowledge in the SAT format. The new exam will include 
a written portion requiring students to write a short essay 
on an assigned topic.

Student Artist Sets Out in Search 
Of Her Stolen Fruit of Delight 
By Julie Chung 
Guardian Reporter 

UCSD enior Andrea Leigh' 
artwork is impressive. So impre 
sive, in fact, that one of her piece! 
was selected as the first artwork b) 
a student to be displayed in a long· 
term exhibition in the Price Center 

That triumph soon turned into a 
private nightmare for Leigh when 
her piece, Fruit oj Delight, was 
stolen from the Price Center Ball-
room hallway on Sept. 20. Since 
then, she has launched a large-scale 
search for the anwork. 

Initially ,Leigh contacted EDNA, 
the UCSD housekeeping staff, and 
the local police. 

She said that few people were 
helpful in her pursuit of the stolen 
artwork. 

NEWS 3 

Leigh said she contacted the 
Guardian not long afterlhe artwork 
was stolen, but was told that the 
paper cannot write a etory about 
every miSSing item on campus. 

''I'm steaming mad because of 
all the lost leads resulting from this 
lack of immediate action," Leigh 
said. 

Student artist Andrea Leigh (left) and her artwork 'Fruit of Delight,' which was stolen from the Price Center in September. 

She then began to search for the 
art herself, posting flyers around 
campus and taking out an advertise-
ment in the Guardian. 

Leigh said she had suggested to 
the housekeeping staff that her art 
be bolteddown through thecarpeted 
floor, but indicated that they denied 
her request, 

So far, UCSD Police Detective 

Doug O'Dell has three leads, but 
said there are no guarantees that the 
artwork will be found. 

Upon entering Leigh's "dining 
room studio," one automatically 
becomes absorbed into the world of 
mannequin art. Through a series of 
dressmaker mannequin art projects 
combining paint, video art, and 
sound sculptures, Leigh tries to ad-
dress different aspects of feminin-
ity. 

"I seek to create an experience of 

femininity that raises the level of 
awareness toward the special beauty 
and plight of woman," sheexplained. 

According to Leigh, Fruit of 
Delight visualizes female sensual-
ity as a positive metaphor about the 
female body. Oranges, papayas, 
melons, and bananas are painted on 
the mannequin, comparing the 
curves offruitto those ofawoman 's 
body, sbe said. 

Leigh began ber mannequin 
projects one year ago following a

In addition to Fruit of Delight, herA 
Miss Steak has been displayed on 
campus at the UCSD Annex Gal-
lery and is temporarily on exhibit at 
the Women's Resource Center. 

Currently, Leigh is working on 
three new worles: Grandmother, 
Mother Butterfly, and Whine. These 
pieces will be exhibited at the Ret-
rospectiveGallery in the U.S. Grant 
Hotel on Friday, Dec. 7. 

Meanwhile, Leigh's search for 

Fruit of Delight continues, not just 
for the financial worth (estimated 
by Leigh as being between $4800 
and $60(0), butforthe artistic value. 

Leigb said that each mafUlequin 
is unique in its own way to the artist 
whose thoughts and ideas translate 
into creating an art piece from or-
dinary objects. 

Anyone who has information on 
the missing artwork: can contact

AMERICA'S DRUG WAR 

What Promising Signs? 
Drug Czar William Bermen is packing up his books and 

cleaning out his desk in Washington, His mission, he says 
proudly, is accomplished. America has its blueprint for a 
comprehensive "war on drugs." Bermett and President Bush are 
encouraged by "very promising signs" that the drug problem is 
diminishi ng. The problem, it seems, may very well take care of 
itself. Yes, everything is smelling like roses. 

But the rosy smell barely covers the pungent stench of the 
Bush Administration's consistent failure of the last two years in 
waging this "war," A look at the crime-plagued neighborhoods 
of Southeast San Diego, South Central Los Angeles, or East and 
West Oakland is a tell-tale sign that this war is being fought with 
real bullets on the streets of America, and law-abiding citizens 
are losing. 

In announcing Bermett's resignation last Thursday, the 
White House tried to j ustify itself by citing public opinion polls 
and not much el e. RecentpoUs have shown that Americans are 
more concerned with the deficit and thecri is in the Persian Gulf 
than the nation's drug problem. A staggering switch, considering 
that at the begirming of 1990, Americans cited drugs as the 
number one problem in the country. 

With Americans' attention refocused on the gulf and other 
things, the Bush Administration seems to have refocused its 
attention as well, hence Bennett 's re ignation, The Persian Gulf 
crisis and domestic pol icy woes gave the president the oppor-
tunity to clean-up an embarra sing mess, 

Bush gave Bennett a heroic send-off, But Bennett is far from 
America's liberator from the dreaded drug problem. Bennett 
proved he was a tough talker, but a weakling when it came to 
solid programs. While drug education programs seem to be 
working fairly well in middle and upper-class regions and 
suburbs, the inner-cities are devastated by the problem, with 
little hope in sight. 

Annual government surveys have shown a downward trend 
in the number of school-age children trying illegal drugs over 
the last several years. However, the number of deaths resul ting 
from overdosing on cocaine leaped 11 percent last year. Heroin 
use and heroin-related deaths also saw a considerable increase. 

Even Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan 
conceded that despite some encouraging signs, "we know that 
one out of every two high school seniors will try an illicit drug 
before high school graduation." It seems then that even the 
education programs which the government is so proud of are 
only working 50 percent of the time. 

President Bush himself was unable to produce a single shred 
of evidence that the U.S. has made any real progress in this war. 

"All the indicators . .. all the studies suggest the same thing. 
1be trendline is that drug use is going down. Nobody knows the 
exact numbers .. . all you can do is go with the trends here," Bush 
insisted, But, as is often the case, general trends do not reflect 
finer reality. 

The finer reality of the U.S, "war on drugs" is this: Education 
is not working, law enforcement is being overwhelmed, inter-
diction has become a daily exercise in futility, and adequate 
treatment is difficult - if not impossible - to find, The 
government is not fighting this war to win, 

Thus far, law enforcement efforts have proven to be little 
more than an occasional inconvenience for big-time drug im-
porters. According to one law enforcement officer in Los 
Angeles, when the police make a bust and seize a huge amount 
of cocaine, they know that double the amount they just seized is 
entering the country, but there is nothing they can do, Law 
enforcement agencies are under-funded, under-ma'1ned, and 
too out-gunned to catch everything. 

Treatment has been a horrible failure in the U.S. anti-drug 
effort. According to a recent National Academy of Sciences 
report, approximately 66,000 drug abusers in the U.S. are on 
waiting lists for admission into public treatment programs, and 
possibly hundreds of thousands more do not even bother to 
apply because of the wait. 

William Bennett laid a blueprint, but his designs were 
incomplete. Luckily, the American people haven ' t noticed and 
don't seem to care,

COMMENTARY 

All Bets Are Off with Iraq 
• If the crisis in the Persian Gulf erupts into war, 
the United States must be willing to go the distance 
By Greg Dixon, Associate Opinion Editor 

As America increases its troop strength in the 
Persian Gulf, many people are raising new 
questions about the mission of the United States 
and about the advisability of our current role in the 
region. 

Central to most of the new concerns is the 
possibility that the United States will try to force 
Hussein out of Kuwait With the addition of 
150,000 combat troops, three aircraft carrier battle 
groups, a battleship surface unit, and DW1leTOUS 
additional attack aircraft, it is hard to see how this 
can be construed as anything other than an 
invasion foICe. .. 

The concern that we may invade in order to 
achieve our goals in the region is a very realistic 
one_ We may see an invasion by the eod of the 
year. 

Iftbe Uoitcd StaleS does invade it must do 80 . 
without any regard for Iraq. 1bis may so\Iod crueL 
It may sound amOral. Unfortunatcly, oiceIies don't 
win wars. Wars are woo by whoever kills off 
enough of the enemy that tbe opponent can't fight 
anymore. The United States must remember Ibis. 
If we invade, we mu,t fight to win. 

America bas many opdons to pursue in an 
invasion, 1be only realistic one is the tota! 
elimination ofIraq's ability to mako war. Unless 
we destroy Iraq's ability to fight by eliminating all 
of Hussein's forces in the region, we will be 
asking for trouble in the future. 

Iraq will not be content with what it bas gained 
already from Ihis conflict. The Iraqi desire for 
conquest will be stronger than ever after this 
confrontation, 

Iraq has demonstrated that it does not learn 
from the past. Its failure against Iran did not stifle 
Iraqi expansionism whatsoever. 

The only solution is to destroy Iraq 's ability to 
engage in offensive warfare. This will not be 
accomplished by an air war. 1be only solution is a 
full-scale war. We must crush Iraq with a combi-
nation of air and ground troops, and a total 
blockade of the nation. 

America carmot assume this will be easy. 
History tells us war never is. America must be 
prepared for a long and bloody war which will see 
casualties in the tens of thousands in the first few 
months alone, 

We must engage in a multi-front attack across 
large areas of territory. Given time and dedication, 

AIJlerica has the ability to engage in a strong 
ground assault and to eliminate the enemy. 

The first element of the invasion Should be the 
wholesale bombing of all Iraqi military and 
industrial installations. These should be com-
pletely leveled. Also of top priority wouW be to 
destroy all chemical and nuclear facilities. 

After all of these strategic targets are elimi-
nated, blanket bombing of major cities should 
ensue. This will bring the war home to the Iraqis 
and demonstrate the costs of continued resis-
tance. 

The second vital element should be a multi-
front ground assault against Iraqi forces. TItis 
should be a heavy assault designed to eliminate 
aD Iraqi armor and equipment in the region. 

If ~ Iraqis u&e of wcapons of mass deatnlC-
. lion - chemical or bioJogicaJ. - the United 
Stales sbould re.spond iD kiDd.lraq must Ieam 
that tbe \lie of force wiD be met by equal Of 
gJeater fon:e. 

Britain' $ Millistty of J:>efc:ue bas abady 
hinted 1bM the u&e 01 Iraqi cbemicaI weapons 
apioat British troops would be met. with 1be ..., 
of bauJetleld nuclear weaponS apinst Iraqi 
U'OOpI. America sboald follow the British lead. 

America bas far more weapons to choose from 
than does Iraq and Americans are better equipped 
to deal with the aftermath. 

Finally, the United States should pursue the 
war against Iraq to its fullest potential with every 
means at our disposal. We should use all avail-
able means to destroy the Iraqi ability to fight, 
with a min imum loss of American life . 

The only way to achieve this last goal is to 
attack Iraq with every available weapot:J in the 
American arsenal. America can choose from an 
array of weapons: from M-16 rifles to Tomahawk 
cruise missiles to F-117A stealth fighters. We 
should use these to their best potential. 

The only way to defeat Iraq is to destroy it. 
Americans must hold no illusions. It will be 

bloody, it will be ugly. 1bere will be many 
casualties and scores of corpses on both sides. 
But the end result will be American victoty and 
Iraqi defeat. 

If America is going to attack Iraq, then we 
should not hold back. We must destroy the 
enemy. 1bere can be no peace without victory.

A Big Headache for Bush 
New York - Did the president 

lose on election night? Yes; but not 
because the Republican Pany suf-
fered minor congressional losses. 
Dropping nine House seats and one 
Senate seat isn't all that bad, given 
what usually happens to the White 
House party in midterm. 

And it's not even the loss of two 
big Sunbelt state-houses that spells 
trouble, Bob Martinez in Florida 
and Clayton Williams in Texas 
managed to sink their own ships all 
by themselves. 

No, what spells trouble for the 
president is the sharply increased 
likelihood that his own right flank 
will carry a renewed sense of be-
trayal and resentment out of this 
election - and perhaps into 1992 
as well . Why? Because one of the 
few national trends that can be di-
vined from this midterm election is 
that the anti-tax message had pow-
erful resonance - and that Presi-
dent Bush deprived his own party 
of the opportunity to use it. 

Again and again, those incum-
bents who did lose were those on 
whom the tax label could be pirmed. 
Florida's Martinez neverrecovered 
from his attempt to impose taxes 
on services and professions. Vot-
ers in Kansas and Oklahoma re-
jected the Republican Party Nhose 

governors had abandoned "no new 
taxes" pledges. In New Jersey, 
voters almost retired Sen. Bill Bra-
dley - who had led by 30 points a 
few weeks ago - because they 
were so angered by Democratic 
Gov. Jim Florio's tax reform pack-
age. This reaction may not repre-
sent the highest level of good citi-
zenship. It is, after all, not always 
easy to measure when populist in-
dignation ends and shortsighted 
selfishness begins. 

What cannot be denied, how-
ever, is the political potency of the 
message. And what is also clear is 
that across the country, Republi-
cans of all ideological persuasions 
had lined up behind the only iden-
tifiable pledge George Bush had 
made to America in 1988: no new 
taxes, 

So when President Bush an-
nounced his Great RetreatlastI une 
26, and when he plunged into the 
clumsily handled budget negotia-
tions this fall, he was not simply 
declaring a change of mind. He 
was undercutting his own case, on 
whose behalf popular Republi-
cans - Lynn Martine of llIinois, 
Claudine Schneider of Rhode Is-
land, Tom Tauke of Iowa - had 
agreed to give up safe House seats 
to run for the Senate. 

Bush also contributed to the 
broader sense of public disillusion 
by demonstrating that no matter 
how clearly and emphatically 
politicians commit themselves to 
a course of action, they never re-
ally mean it. 

Now, with the elections dem-
onstrating the potential power of 
the tax issue, the American right is 
likely to feel doubly betrayed, Not 
only did the president abandon 
them on a matter of principle, he 
squandered an issue the Republi-
cans had largely owned for more 
than a decade. 

What would have happened, 
they will argue, had there been no 
repudiation of the no-tax pledge? 
What would have happened if the 
president had challenged the Con-
gress to cut spending, had faced 
them down on government shut-
down, had insisted that "business 
as usual" no longer be the national 
motto? 

Suppose a combated George 
Bush had helped an angry public 
focus a vague "anti-incumbency" 
message into a clear choice on 
taxes. 

Maybe Rudy Boschwitz would 
have been saved in Minnesota. 
Maybe Tom Tauke would have 
won in Iowa. Maybe Bill Bradley 
would have gotten knocked of by 
Christine Whitman in New Jersey. 
And what would that have done to 
make George Bush into a giant-
killer to be feared by Congress 
over the next two years? 

Of course, much of this theory 
may be fantasy. It may be that "no 
new taxes" was nothing more than 
a pipe dream of the romantics on 
the right. It may be that George 
Bush really had no other respon-
sible choice, and that this con-
summate insider who loves nego-
tiation and compromise was never 
suited to the role of Harry 
Truman - Harold Truman ill is 
more like it. 

But the political point is that 
conservatives deeply believe the 
scenario, And they are not likely to 
forgive easily. Moreover, political 
history shows that presidents who 
cannot quell dissent in their own 
political ranks- Lyndon Johnson 
in 1968,JerryFordin 1976,Jimmy 
Carter in 1980 - find re-election 
either too difficult to contemplate 
or impossible to achieve, 

And that is why, whatever the 
numbers show, it cannot be a very 
happy White House right now.

"Don't kill yourselves, " Bill's dad admonished us. ItGreat," I thought to myself, 'fm 
as good as dead. He's jinxed us. Now somebody's gotta die ... "

.• Hunting and relieving yourself can be a dangerous combination 
I had never used a real gun 

in my life until I went on a 
hunting trip at Bill's "Ranch." 
As a child, my mother wouldn't 
even let me use a BB gun. 

"You'll shoot your eye out," 
was my mom's reasoning. 

So, when my friend Bill 
suggested we go on a hunting 
trip I immediatly agreed. 

A group of about ten people 
(halfofthe group consisted of 
kids) lefr in the late morning 
and drove east into the boonies 
of San Diego. 

Bill's "Ranch," it turned out, 
was a parcel ofland with lots 
and lots of brush, and lots ands 
of space to get lost and die in . 
It was also hot and dry. And, of 
course, there were no 
bathrooms. It was real 
mountain-man country. 

For a while we just wandered 
around, but then the group got 
hungry for some action. 

So, Bill set up some cans and 
people began shooting. I JUSt 
watched . 

Steve, Bill's older brother, 
said, "I've had enough of this 
crap ... it's time for some live 
game." 

Steve organized a hunting 
party and said, "let's go find 

BY JAMES COLLIER 
something to kill." 

I decided to tag along with 
Steve's group, even though I had 
a strange feeling something 
terrible was going to happen . 

"Don' t kill yourselves," Bill ' s 
dad admonished us. 

"Great," I thought to myself, 
"I'm as good as dead. He's 
jinxed us. Now some body's 
gotta die ... " 

As we trudged across the 
"Ranch," people started acting a 
bit strange . Bill was climbing on 

rocks looking for something to 
shoot. And, Steve was acting 
like a soldier from " Rat Patrol." 

"Stay low, men," Steve said 
as we walked through the brush . 

A bird flew by and everybody 
started shooting away, but 
nobody hit it. 

AlTer a couple of hours we 
didn't see another living thing, 
so the group resigned itself to 
shooting branches off trees. 

"Wanna try your hand at 
shooting?" Steve asked . 

"Sure," I said . 
Steve handed me his rifle and 

I shot a couple of rounds into 
the ground. 

I felt a small rush of 
exhilaration, and I started 
shooting at branches with 
everyone else . 

We'd been hiking for a few 
hours when nature called . 

"I'll be right back," I said, 
and headed for some bushes. 

Suddenly, I heard bullets 
flying over m y head. "Jesus," I 
exclaimed as I hit the dirt. 

"There's somebody over 
here!" I screamed. 

"Sorry," I heard somebody 
say. 

What a trip ...

w. BASKETBALL: Aging like a fine wine 
Continued from page 12 
vaulted into the UCSD record 
books in four categories: single-
sea on and career scoring ::nd re-
bounds. 

Junior guard Kalhleen Alvarez 
(lOppg),and6'2" ophomoreLi a 
Beaver (9 ppg) were se ond and 
third in scoring, respectively. 

Alvarez was sidelined mid-
season with an arm injury, which 
no doubt hurt a promising season, 
but returned to bolster the Tritons' 
three-point shooting and earn Best 
Offense honors. 

Beaver, last eason's Rookie of 
the Year, will start at the post-
forward position. 

UCSD's only senior is 
Bernadette Diepenbrock, who re-
turns to start at power forward for 
the third year. 

The four-year veteran has a 
reputation for consistency, and has 
also broken into the career and 
single-season rebounding lists. 

In addition to the veterans, 
UCSD has picked up three new 
players - two freshmen and a 
junior - a figure that Head Coach 
Judy Malone feels is safer than the 
nine rookies UCSD sported last 
season. 

Of the three, Molly Jonnum, a 
transfer from Division I St. Mary 's 
College, will j ump right into the 
fray as the shooting guard, adding 
experience and an outside gun. 

The only true rookies are for-
ward Emily Rubin and Sara Miller, 
a transfer from Sweden who will 
spend most of this year growing 

Mar Grand Prix again. 
o With Darryl Strawberry now 

on the Dodgers ' roster, you would 
think L.A. fans are jumping out of

they want to snatch Bren Butler

tell you how many times Lasorda 
wished he had a seventh outfielder.

ONLY THE 19th 

Remember-only one Guardian 
i sue (next Monday) during 

Thanksgiving week. 

accustomed to American-style 
basketball. 

Guard Monique Vaillancourt 
returns with sophomore status af-
ter a year hiatus. 

"She is good on the press, i the 
team's quicke t player, and has a 
good shot," Malone aid. 

Rounding out the roster are oth-
ers who gained experience as 
fre hmen last sea on: Erica Scholl, 
guard Alison Cartwright, and for-
ward Serena Murillo. 

Even wi th a year under their 
belt, Malone remains cautious. 

"We're still pretty young," she 
said. "We've got a lot of raw talent 
and have much to learn." 

On the offensive end , Malone 
and Assistant Coach Jan Martin 
have been making a few pOSitional 
changes - mainly to replace 
former point guard Nancy Caparaz, 
who grad uated as UCSD' sail-time 
career assist leader. 

Alvarez is competing with 
sophomore Michelle DiGuilio, a 
reserve last year, for the starting 
honors at the point. 

" Kathleen is a much better 
shooter, but Michelle has got speed 
and height ," Malone said. 
"[Alvarez) has a good three-point 
shol. At point guard, she's losing a 
lot of opportunities to take that 
shol." 
. Nonetheless, Malone believes 
Alvarez has an excellent chance to 
be among the national leaders in 
three-point shooting. 

Malone has alternated the two 
in scrimmage games, and might do 

to win the whole chimichanga next 
season, but with Strawberry in 
center, Kat Daniels in left, and 
Hubie Brooks in right, L.A. will 
have the worst defensive outfield 
in baseball. 

o Which means my favorite 
team, the Cincinnati Reds, should 
win the NL West again. 

o The Padres are taking drastic 

the same when the season starts. 
Whoever doesn't get the starting 
nod will be the first off the bench, 
according to Malone. 

Yet another additlon i new 
Assistant Coach Jim Mottershaw, 
whose main duty will be to polish 
the Tritons' defense. With 22 years 
of coaching experience under his 
belt - most recently ix. years at 
local Clairemont High School -
Motter haw better make it shine. 

In contra t to UCSD's youth 
are the gnarled veteran clubs on 
the Tritons' regular season sched-
ule. 

Former national champs 
Scranton (PA) and SI. Thomas 
(MN) will do battle with UCSD in 
its own tournament at the end of 
December, followed by a home 
matchup with Nazareth Colleg'!, 
which edged out UCSD for a re-
gional slot last year. 

Those three games mark the 
beginning of an eight-gam e

1990 NCAA DIVISION III WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL NATIONAL FINAL FOUR 

A Chance for Redemption 
• Women's volleyball ventures back to Washington University 
in St. Louis, with an eye on its sixth national championship in 
10 years, and the first for a new generation of Tritons 
By Dana Chaiken 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD women ' volleyball team is trav-
eling toSt. Louis in search ofacoupon - a two-
for-one deal it would receive by clipping the 
third-seeded College of St. Benedict Blazers 
(MN) in the NCAA Di vision III National Semi-
finals Friday night. 

With the win, the second-seeded Tritons 
would eam the opportunity to redeem that 
coupon for revenge for its only loss in 20 
Divi ion III game , and claim UCSD's sixth 
national title. 

The first half is pending the outcome of 
Friday 's other emifinal matchup, between 
defending champion Wa hington University 
(MO) and Juniata (PA). 

The odds favor top-seeded Washington, 
which i making history as the first school to 
host the final in back-to-back years. Con e-
quently, the Bears could be the first team to 
capture the title on their home court two year in 
a row. But the fourth-seeded Juniata Indians, a 
perennial national contender, definitely have 
the potential to upset the Bears. 

Still. UCSD Head Coach Doug Dannevik 
feels there is a separation between UCSD and 
Washington, and the Indians and Blazers. 

"We are as good as Washington, but we 
would have to play error-free to beat them," 
Dannevik said. 

All the teams have at least seen each other 
play, with notebooks at the ready, if not having 
engaged in on-court battle. Suffice it to say, the 
weekend will be a bambumer (apologies to 
Midwesterners). 

the finals of the Bears ' national-caliber in-
vitational a month ago. 

It was at Wa hington ' tournament that 
the Tritons (3S -8) edged St. Benedict 's, IS-
12, 12- 1S, IS -13, IS-13. 

The Blazer tayed in that match with 
extremely stingy defense, supplying few 
pores for the Triton pikes to fill. In effect, 
the Tritons pounded away with each hit, 
chipping away at the Blazers ' wall , only 
breaking through enough to steal the match. 

UCSD may gain added confidence in 
that it was barely at full trength for the trip, 
as freshman etter Amy Banachowski was 
making her first appearance after missing 
several matches with a prained ankle. 

Juniata was in an even worse state of 
decimation when it journeyed to the La 
Verne Invitational, falling in four to the 
Tritons. The Indians were minus four start-
ers, who are all back for the national final 
four, and should make things competitive. 

UCSD, which at the time was still in the 
early stages of bonding veterans with six 
freshmen, let the first game slip 12-1S, but 
held Juniata under double-digits in the re-
maining games, winning 15-9, IS-7, IS-6. 

The Tritons' loss to Washington fol-
lowed in the one-for-you, one-for-me pat-
tern, as the teams split the first two games 
each at IS-12. 

The Bears grabbed the third 15-6, and 
UCSD looked to take the fourth game when 
it was tied at 13, but the Tritons lost the next 
two points and the match. 

Vikki Van Duyne is one of three Tritons voted to the AI/-West Region team. 

UCSD has the most comprehensive infor-
mation on the other teams, accumulating vid-
eotapes of its own matches against the three-
victories over Juniata (41-8) and St. Benedict's 
(30-3), and its lone loss to Washington (30-2) in 

Though WaShington has the home-court 
advantage, UCSD ha history and an expe-
rienced coach on its side. The Bears had 
never appeared in the national finals before 
last year. Then again, most of this year's 
Tritons haven't either. 

AI, the NAACp, 
And Ferris State 
By Peter Ko 
Associate Sports Editor 

Just a few notes: 
• The NAACP condemned the Cal football team for 

accepting a bid to play Wyoming in the Copper Bowl in 
Tuscon, Arizona. So, what exactly does thi condemnation 
entail? Loss of toilet privileges? It would be very surprising 
if "Rebel Without a Cause" Cal reconsiders. 

COMMENTARY 
• The best team in football is the New York Giant . The 

second best might be the Miami Dolphins. The question is 
how in the world did the Dolphins find a defen!>e and lose a 
passing game in just one summer? 

• If the Chargers keep this up ... they might fi nish the 
season at .SOO - which will probably be good enough to get 
them into the playoffs. 

• If One game (e.g. Notre Dame v . Stanford) can be 
forgiven, then Washington, no~ Notre Dame, is till the best 
college football team in the nation. 

• Rumor has it that by the end of this school year, the 
UCSD administration will decide whether or not the 
intercollegiate program will move up to Divi ion 11.

VINTAGE '90 
• Preview: Women's basketball 
hopes to savor this year after reaping 
a barrel of experience last season 
By Andrew Gayton 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD women's basketball team has grown older, and hopefully, like a fine wine, better with age. 
Last year, odds favored a season cf woe for the 

Tritons' fledgling team, composed of just two tarting 
veterans leading a corps of nine newcomers. 

It 's true the Tritons finished nothing like the record-
breaking '88-'89 team which notched the program's 
best season at 19-6, but they did manage to float above 
the .500 mark after a dismal 0 -3 start. 

They finished 13-120verall, even though they dropped 
three of their final four game . 

But all that is behind this now- ea oned group of 
veterans, and they are ready to reap the rewards of a 
rebuilding year. 

Cari Young, a 5 ' 1 0" cenler, led the team in coring 
(14.6) and rebounding (8.7) la t year and is back to !>tan 
her junior ea on after earning co-MVP honor . he
