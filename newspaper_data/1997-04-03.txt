Acros the nation , 
hundreds of thousands 

of families with students 
receiving financial aid , 

are reporting smaller 
incomes and ~avings than 

they actually possess in 
order to receive larger grants 

and loans. Moreover, they get 
away with this crime with few 
- if any - repercussion . 

About half of all undergrad-
uates receive some sort of 
financial aid - approximately 
$50 billion per year at the fed-
erallevel, according to the U.S. 
Department of Education 
(D.O.E.). 
The D.O.E. audited 2.3 million 
of the 1995-96 recipients of 
Pell Grants, which are express-

students. It found that about 
4.4 percent of the families

Hospital aumges Difficult 
But Necessary for Survival 

The advent of managed care has forced myri ad ch a ngc~ 
on U SO Healthcarl!. Incn:ased competition and industry 
overcapacity have led the cl inica l enterprise group to 
undertake extl!nsiVl! res tructu ring in thl! pu rsui t of prof-

The re forms undertaken in reccnt years have produced 
res ult s. L as t year's $20 Illilli on loss has bee n rep laced by 
a sli ght $2 milli on profit thi s yea r. Howl!ve r. the group is 
not out o f thl! woods ye t. 

tafTing level s at group hospita ls are still considerably 
hi gher than thosl! found at O 's competitors . And thl! 
l!nterpr ise group sti ll is presented with a very grim rea l i-
t : Preve lll th l! rinancial hemorrhag ing fro m oceurillg

announccmcnt that 190 fu ll -time positions (or the equi va-

The (;On~quenl:e, forthe uni ver-

of promoting and expanding th~ 
scope of human knowledge (and 

tran~mitling that knowledge to

Of course. academics are not the

of us have a tendency to sec what 
we want to see. and steer questions 
we confront in the direction which 
makes them the most intellectually 
palatable. It is human nature to 
want to play the game at whieh one 
happens to eXl:el. Yet settling into 
comfon zones robs us of the rich-

CRASH 
Bizarre "auto-erotic" thriller opens eyes 

By Mark Palansky 
Guardian Reporter 

Based on J.G , Bal lard 's 1973 
novel or the ~ame namc, David 
Cronenberg's "Crash" i ~ a complex 
and shocking look at where the 
innovations of modem life have led 
us and how du II our jaded senses 
have become. Like the book, the 
film is a cautionary tale of how we 
might adapt to the environment that 
we have created , one that is sterile 
and isolatcd from nature, 

Through this isolation, we have 
developed a fixation with 
machines , The car, perhaps the 
most prominent machine in our 
lives, i taken to another level that 
many of us have never fat homed 
exploring. The au tomobile has 
become both a coffin on wheels 
and a place to play out our sexual 
fantasies . 

The premise of the film is rela-
tively simple, lames Ballard 
(James Spader) is in a near-fatal car 
accident with Dr. Helen Remington 
(Holly Hunter). The accident draws 
him to an exploration of the links 
between danger, sex and death. 

After the crash, Ballard, along 
with hi s wife Catherine (Deborah 

ROADSIDE: James Spader and Deborah Kara Unger in "Crash" 

Kara Unger) and Remington, 
become involved with Vaughan 
(Elias Koteas), a renegade scientist 
obsessed by the erotic power of car 
crashes. 

Not only do Vaughan and his 
strange cult watch test collision 
films. they also re-enact famous car 
crashes. Through this new world, the 
Ballards and Remington gain a new 
knowledge of sexuality and mortali-
ty that will ultimately lead them to 
continue to challenge death, 

This film illustrates how desen-
sitized our society has become. The 
characters in the film knock on 
hell 's door to get the most out of 
their sexual experiences, Cronen-
berg combines the two things audi -
ences like best - sex and violence 
- but he docs it in such a manner 
that may cause the audience to be 
scared or even repulsed. Very few 
films can change someone's out-
look, yet Cronenberg and "Crash" 
may succeed in doing just that. 

SMILLA'S SENSE OF SNOW 
Breathtaking landscape is only highlight 

By Ilona Fass 
Co-Associate Hiatus Editor 

Fox Searchlight Pictures' film 
"Srnilla's Sense of Snow" tell s the 
story of a woman who discovers 
the sordid connection 
helween a mining com-
pany's faik:d exp lo-
ration and a little b y's 
murder. 

Torn between two 
nationalities, Denmark 
and Gre.: nland - the 
source of her "sense of 
snow"- Smilla (Ju lia 
Ormond) relates more to icc and 
sc ience than peopl e. The fi 1m 
begins with a promising scene in 
which an entire landscape of snow 
ex plodes. Unfortunately. this 
intrigu ing opening stands in stark 
contrast to the remaining two mun-

An abundance of attention is 

given 10 Ihe landsca pe and Ihe 
development of Smilla 's character. 
The result is that the relationships 

between Ihe characters are 
never full y de ve loped and 
the plot is full of holes, 

Ormond gives a believ-
ahle performance with a 
strong sens.: of focus. She 
is a h.:ro b.:causc of her 
intellectual capacities 
rather than her sex ual 
appeal, although there is a 

token sex scene. The highlights of 
the film are the few comedic inter-
ludes featuring Smilla, her father 
and her father's snotty young wife. 
who has a habit of wearing leotards 
and spandex. 

The beautiful snowscape. shot 

on location in Greenland and Den-
mark. will take your breath away, 
One scene involves an ice floc in 
Greenland 's Disko Bay, which 
pro ves more impressive than the 
scene i tsel r. 

Director Bille Au gusl focus.:s 
on Smi lla's character as a vehicle 
through which the story i ~ commu -
nica ted. However. onl y the outl ine 
of his intentions are ever visi bl e. 

Our desire for a rev..:ialton of 
some sort or an intense sequel1l:e of 
action is never satiated . A simpk 
addition such a ' spICier music 
might have helped to keep the 
viewer awake. 

Although Smilla 's multilayered 
personality is interesting, the land-
scape is breathlaking and the plot 
itself has potential. the movie as a 
whole fa lls Ilat.

EP Opiate for a brutal perfor-
mance of its title track . 

Tool's music is a pOlent com-
plement to lead singer Maynard 
J ames Keenan' s heart felt and per-

sona��y revealing lyrics dealing 
with contemporary issues such as 
addiction and child abuse. 

Throughout Ihe show, Keenan 
maintained a healthy rapport with 
the crowd, telling jokes and dis-
cussing his odd philosophy of life 
and the music industry. It was 
sometimes hard to take the singer 
seriously, as he was clad only in 
polka-dot boxers and bluc paint. 
However, Tool's thousands of 
dedicated followers know what 
the band is really about. 

Sunday night. Tool proved that 
in order for this type of music to 
survive and thrive into the next mil -
lennium. bands need to keep cre-
ativity and musicianship a~ top pri -
orities. These qualiti es are the com-
mon threads that run through Ihis 
last handful of bands keeping the 
metal genre alive on life support , 

From the album 's first track, 
"Noise Brigade." comes the same 
recipe that made the Bosstones a 
ska-punk favorite - a blend of 
punk/funk guitar with a huge 
offering of horns, all led by Ihe 
raspy vocals of lead singer Dicky 
Barrett. 

"Nevermind Me," one of the 
album 's best offerings, duplicates 
'80s-rock, emulating the best 
attributes of The Cure. The Pre-
tenders and later-era Police. 

' 'The Impression That I Get," 
Ihe album's first single. is probably 
the best track. with a bou ncy beat , 
meaty ska guitar rhythms and riffs 
from the live-piece horn section. 

The band 's popularily wi ll prob-
ably skyrocket with thi s n;cord, and 
why nOI'! Uf 'S Face It makes you 
want 10 dance.

The Vegas Beat 

C.n.y·a ..... I •• rra.'mlllion 
-
.*' 

The Vegas Beat is an exciting 
concept- two touring members of 
the Team Dresch and a bass player 
meet up in the dreary rain or the 
Pacific Northwest to write crazy 
punk rock. Sometimes concepts 
just don't pan out. 

The opening chord of the CD 
hold the promise of another ri ff-
roaring fest through the hearts and 
minds of some girl-Iovin ' women. 
but never enter the territory 
mapped out by fellow northwest -
erners Team Dresch and the Third 
Sex, Though songs like "U.EO." 
and "Just a Cell" have the potential 
to be passionate pop songs. the 
spark of originality that makes 
songs inspiring never appears. 

The album doesn't capture the 
Vegas Beat 's live power. By the 
seventh song, the album just gets 
old. The band indulges in sloppy 
song-writing that utilizes a three-
chord chorus pop structure which 
doesn't vary from track to track. 

Listening to this album reminds 
one of that Smurday night bad pany 
feeling when you are stuck standing 
in the corner with a boring person 
who looked so fine from far away.

DIANA MUCHOWSKI, 

Honda Award Nominee. 

{ Xow l.hal's yo;"nylo 100.k yreal on a resume, } 

Every year, the Honda Awards Program recognizes the top collegiate women athletes in each of eleven NCAA Sports. While you may recall hearing about the fourteen 1995-96 winner of this award, you may nO[ have known about your chool's other 
nominees. They are also at the top of their individual sports, and provide inspiration and motivation to other 

" 
female athletes all over the country. For this distinction, a $},OOO donation will be made to the general scholarship 

fund of each of their schools. And this should most likely add to an already impressive per formance record.

UCSD baseball learn 's April Fools Day mas-
sacre. 

The Trilons were coming off a lremendous 
spring break in which they wenl a perfecl 3-0. 
Led by the hot hilling and pilching of Chris 
Rondeslvedl, and Ihe limely hilling of George 
Escanuelas and Eric Pan ge linan . David 
Takehara. Malhew Livingston and David 
Siegel also notched great performances on Ihe 
mound. 

Head Coach Roherl Fletcher and com-
pany opened April al 10- 10. looking 10

Baptisl College. In Iheir previous meeling 
al Tri lon Stadium, UCSD carne back from a

of hil S hy Ryan Hill and Mark Mason. UCSD 
was ex pecting a tough mat l.: hup on the road: 
Ca l Baplist has a good squad_ and they arc 
doin g ex treme ly we ll in their NA IA confer-
ence . 

While the Tritons were looking to ex tend 
Iheir winning streak, Fletcher recognil.cd Ihe 

imporlance of Ihe upcoming doubleheader 
with Division III rival Cal Lutheran this Sal-
urday. He limiled his larter, Michael Bedar, 
as well as Theo Robi ns, 10 a pilch count. 
Flclcher wanted his slaff to be warm, but nor 
Slrai ned. 

Flercher would get part of hi s wi h. Many 
of hi s pilchers would get some work in, and 
none of lhem for 100 long. In facl, six differenl 
pilchers would see action, but that would be 
because they couldn' l hold Ihe Lancer hillers. 
It wa n ' I so much the subpar pilching as il was 
Ihe amazing Lancer hill ing. Before Yoshayah 
Goldfarb came in to regisler Ihe final oul, Ihe 
Lancers would ring Ihe bell 20 limes on 17 
hilS. 

The Trilon offense Ihal scored an incred-
ible 48 runs in ils three spring break conleSIS 
spullered aga insl Ihe Lancer hurler. UCSD 
would only manage two hilS all day: a single 
byNickWil on and adouble byRondeslvedt. 

Whi Ie Ihe resullS of Ihi s game sound ler-
rible,lhe learn has heen playing great ba eball 
lalely . Thi s loss was definilely a fluke. The 
pain is lessened even furlher by the fact thaI 
this game was against an AlA opponenl, so 
the Team's Division III record was nOI lar-
nished. 

They do, however, need to shake off Ihi s 
loss and Slay at the confidcnce levellhal the 
spring-break wins provided . Cal Lutheran is 
an eX lrcmely tough team. The Rega ls are 
ranked third nalionally and have alway s had 
success agai nst UCSD. These games will be 
an accurate measuring Sli ck of the Tritons' 
progress. On Salurday, Ihe Cardiac Kids will

11le Padres aresi mply bcllenhan Ihe Dodg-
ers. They have more offense, beller defense 
and are only slighlly worse when il comes 10 
staning pilching. Don't be surpri sed if Towers 
and Lucchino get crafty and acquire a solid 
staner. Also, Trevor " andman" Hoffman is a 
much beller closer Ihan Todd Worrell.

The Padre: 
World Champs 

Tuesday was opening day , 
and some alarming messages 
were sent to the re. t of the 

ational League by a ce rtain 
team from a certain city ... daaaa 
Padres! 

The message to Dodger 
fans: Sorry. you choke arti ts, 
but the Padres did it last year, 
and they ' ll do it again thi s 
year. To Braves fans: You ' ve 
had your fun in the fall classic, 
but now it ' s time for a change. 
Besides, your impression of the 
Buffalo Bills was too accurate. 

In previewing the coming 
season, the vast majority of 
baseball analy~ t s predicted that 
the Dodgers would win the 

ational League\ Western 
divi ion. There wa~ little ink 
ahout the defending champs 
from San Diego. What was ~o 
great about the Dodger!>' 
offseason? They ~ i g ned Todd 
Zeile, a journeyman at be~ t. 
Wow. 

What did the Padre!. do? 
Well , they onl y acquired ~peed , 
power and completed one of 
the shrewdest trades in recent 
history . Trading tor Quilvio
