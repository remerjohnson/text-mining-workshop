Violation Exceptions Routine In Campus Food politics. 

Campus department 
gave passes for violations 
at several eateries that 
broke state health and 
safetY codes. 

By Vladimir Kogan 
SENIOR STAFF WRITER 

On multiple occasions, senior staff 
at the UCSD department charged with 
enforcing food health and safety laws 
allowed various campus food facilities to 
remain in operation without complying 
with state regulations, a six-month analy-
sis of thousands of university records and 
photos obtained under the state's public-
records law indicates. 

The analysis, part of the Guardian's 

three-year examination of UCSD's 
Department of Environment, Health and 
Safety, presents an unusual and unique 
case study in the politics and conflicting 
forces that shape the everyday func -
tions of California's most elite public 
university. The documents also provide 
an important look at how the UC system's 
autonomy from the rest of the state's gov-
ernment institutions, guaranteed under 
the California Constitution, has allowed 
the university's campuses to serve both 
as businesses and their own regulators, 
with both functions often overseen by the 
same top administrators. 

10 recent 'months, a series of audits 
focused on UC pay have faulted the uni-
versity for breeding a culture of excep-
tions: On one hand, it crafts complex and 
rigid rules to govern univertity conduct, 
and on the other, it disregards them 

when cnnvenient. The Guardian's analy-
sis suggests that this culture extends to 
areas beyond compensation - including 
those affecting the safety of its students, 
patients and staff - and raises key ques-
tions about the structure and ;ldministra-
tive hierarchy of the university. 

'A Major Change' 
Emblematic of the EHS approach to 

health inspections and th~ application of 
relevant state laws is the story of UCSD 
Medical Center at Hillcrest. 

In July of 2005, the department's new-
est health inspector noted that the facil -
ity lacked "a constant supply of pres-
surized potable hot water at least 120 
degrees Fahreqheit; as required under 
the California Uniform Food Facilities

Loan Agency Drops Student Fee Discount 
With low reserves, state 
aid group reverts back to 
charging students a' 
I-percent loan fee. 

By MaUlKw McArdle 
ASSOCIATE NEWS EDITOR 

EdFund, a branch of the California 
Student Aid Commission responsible 
for administering federal loan programs, 
announced that it would no longer be waiv-
ing a mandatory -guarantee fee- paid by 
students to loan guarantors, which pay for 
a borrower's debt if he or she should default 
on a loan obligation. 

The fedenlly mandated change. which 
comes on the heels of a state audit of 
EdFund'. fiscal practica. is one of numer-
ous federal loan policy alterations required 

by Congress' recent passage of the Deficit 
Reduction Act of 2005. 

Even though the law takes effect July 
1, EdFund, which processes $7.8 billion in 
loans annually, has said that it will honor 
its commitment to borrowers not to charge 
the fee f()r all loans guaranteed on or before 
Sept. 30 of this year. 

According to EdFund Director of 
Communications Allison Bradley Fleming, 
at UCSD the average Stafford loan is $4,400, 
meaning that the average borrower would 
pay a default guarantee fee of $44. 

-About 71 percent of all borrowing at 
UCSD occurs between July 1 and Sept. 30 
- the period during which we'll be pay-
ing the fee on behalf of borrowers," she 
stated in an e-mail. -Ifborro"ng remains 
similar to previous years, EdFund will pay 
about $510,000 in default fees on behalf of

Study:VVeed, lung 
Cancer Not Linked 
Smoking marijua na, even regu-

larly and heavily, does not increase 
a person's risk of lung cancer, 
according to a new UCLA study, 
produci ng results that have sur-
prised even the resea rchers. 

The study, funded by the National 
Institutes of Health, compared the 
lifetime marijuana use of 1,200 
head, lung and neck cancer patients 
and 1,040 people without cancer, 
matched by age, sex and neighbor-
hood. The results concluded that 
marijuana smoke did not boost a 
person's chance of developing any 
of the three cancers studied. 

Although there was no mari-
juana-cancer link, the researchers 
did find a 20-fold increase in lung 
cancer in people who smoked more 
than two packs of cigarettes per 
day. 

Administrators Lift 
Block on SRTV Signal 

Student leaders remain unsatis-
fied with administrators after Vice 
Chancel/or of Student Affairs Joseph 
w. Watson authorized the reacti-
vation of Student-Run Television's 
signal last week. 

The station is still limited to 
daytime programming, how-
ever, to ensure broadcasts com-
ply with Federal Communications 
Commission standards. 

In November, Assistant Vice 
ChancE'lIor of Student Life Gary R. 
Ratcl iff - with Watson's approval 
- denied a request by A.S. coon-
cilmembers to restore the station's 

signal, which is broadcast on the 
university's Triton Cable. The coun-
cil had shut the station down after 
pornography was repeatedly aired 
on the channel. SRTV officials 
contended that they were legally 
allowed to broadcast the material, 
but administrators said that because 
the station used the university's sig-
nal, it would have to abide by cam-
pus restrictions. 

Those restrictions where out-
lined in Triton Cable's "acceptable 
use policy/ drafted by Ratcliff and 
other administrators. The docu-
ment, which barred explicit sexual 
material from SR1Y, is currently 
being reviewed by the UC Office 
of the President before it is to be 
implemented. 

A.S. President Harry Khanna and 
SRlV Manager Andrew Tess said 
that after UCOP review, Ratcliff is 
expecting only minor changes to 
the AUP. 

"Having this signal is better 
than nothing, but it's not where we 
want to be: Tess said. "We're not 
opposed to the idea of policies, but 
it is unreasonable." 

While Khanna - who met with 
Watson last to request the station's 
reactivation - said that the student 
govemmentwouldstayoutof any legal 
battles between SRlV and admin-
istrators, he added that the council 
would like to see major changes to 
the AUP. However, a demand by 
Watson that the AS. Council formally 
acknowledge that SRlV falls under 
the purview of the AUP could restrict 
the council's support for the station, 
according to Khanna. 

"We understand our hands are 
tied: he said. "While we think the 
AUP is overreaching and inappro-
priate, we're still in a corner."

Department Granted Violation Waivers to Food Vendors FOOD EVALUATIONS 
• INSPECTIONS, from page 1 
Law, the code governing eateries. 

"This must be abated within 24 
hours: Inspector Darryl Yorkey 
wrote in the report, noting that the 
facility's hot water was 15 degrees 
below the minimum. 

Almost six months later, in 
January of 2006, Yorkey found water 
at the facility even further out of 
compliance, ranging between 95 
ana 102 degrees. 

"Imminent risk observed, this 
facility must restore approved pres-
surized potable hot water within 
24 hours," Yorkey wrote again in 
January. 

Now, almost a year after the ini-
tia� inspection, the faCility has yet 
to comply. 

The problem, according to the 
medical center's Director of Grounds 
Dennis E. Goodrich, is that the hos-
pital has only one water-feeding sys-
tem, which pumps hot water to the 
top of the facility, and then allows 
gravity to pull it down through the 
patient areas to the kitchen on the 
ground 'floor. Under separate regu-
lations governing the temperature 
of water in the hospital, it cannot 
exceed 110 degrees in patient areas. 

" Please understand that the 
building was designed and built SO 
years ago. to meet the standards for 
a community hospital at the time,-
Goodrich said in a recent interview. 
"So we're using a system used SO 
years ago.-

In November, the hospital began 
to draw out plans for a second source 
of water, exclusively for the kitchen . 
The process, which requires approval 
from the state agency that regulates 
health facilities, wilI take at least 
several more months to complete; 
in the meantime, the medical center 
is attempting to carry out most food 
preparations during the night, when 
temperatures can be boosted with-
out affecting sleeping patients. 

The estimated cost for the new 

saturday 
June 3' 

water system is $450,000, and the 
price tag for fIXing all of the prob-
lems identified in Yorkey's report 
runs over a million dollars. 

In the meantime, however, EHS 
has taken a usual step: It has exempt-
ed the hospital from complying with 
certain sections of CURFFL. the 
state's health code. Last December, 
for example. Yorkey noted in an 
inspection report that, although the 
water was stilI below the minimum 
temperature, the hospital had an 
"abatement variance on file"; state 
law makes no mention of such vari-
ances. 

EHS Safety and Risk Manager 
John D. Schmidt, while denying that 
the department ever issued such a 
variance, suggested that inspectors 
may sometimes need to be more 
flexible than rigid laws. 

"UCSD does not issue variances, 
but codes do not address every con-
ceivable situation, so aU inspectors 
must use professional judgment to 
interpret and apply the codes they 
enforce," Schmidt stated in an e-
mail. 

AskC;d about the specific note 
in the hospital's inspection report, 
Schmidt said, "That's Darryl's state-
ment, you have to ask him what he 
meant. We ' don't have 'variances; 
and I don't know why he put that." 

At the same time, however, the 
department has declined to allow 
the inspector to speak with the 
Guardian regarding his reports. 

"Darryl Yorkey is not working in 
the food safety program at this time 
and therefore it would not be appro -
priate for him to represent EHS in 
regards to food safety issues," EHS 
Director Sleven Benedict stated in 
an e-mail. 

I n response to repeated calls and 
e-mails, Yorkey issued a statement 
explaining that he had been told not 
to communicate with the media. 

"I have been previously instruct-
ed by my immediate supervision 

that I am not to speak with or 
take interviews from you or other 
members of the media concerning 
departmental policy or individual 
facility inspections," Yorkey stated . 

'Our Historical Perspective' 
In internal e-mails turned over 

in response to the public-records 
request, Yorkey expressed par-
ticular worry over how the water 
issue could affect the immuno-sup- . 
pressed patients being treated at 
the hospital. However, it was not 
the first time the inspector raised 
questions about how the university 
interpreted the health code. 

In late 2004. shortly after he was 
hired, Yorkey ordered operators of 
the RIMAC Uti Cafe, a small coffee 
cart next to the arena, to stop serv-
ing soup and cooking food on a bar-
beque, explaining that the cart was 
allowed to sell only "pre-packaged, 
non-potentially hazardous food ." 

The order upset Director of Sports 
Facilities Donald E. Chadwick, who 
wrote an angry e-mail to Schmidt. 

"EHS has preViously enjoyed a 
good reputation for working with 
departments, finding out what 
departments wanted to do, educat-
ing and helping them to achieve 
their goals;' Chadwick stated. "Is it 
now - let's blindside them and shut 
down their operations .. 3" 

In response, Schmidt admit-
ted that the department had been 
less than fully alert in its previous 
enforcement of the law. 

"The regulations have changed 
over the years , and our extended 
vacancy in this position (three years) 
precluded us from being as vigilant 
as we should have been in the area of 
health inspections," Schmidt stated 
in an e-mail to Chadwick. "Darryl is 
very thorough, which we encourage, 
but does not yet have the benefit of 
our historical perspective." 

In subsequent interviews, 
Schmidt said that the phrase "his-

lorical perspective" referred to a 
specific exception in the health code 
that allowed certain outdated equip-
ment to be grand fathered in under 
the current laws, not to the previous 
relationship between EHS and other 
campus departments. _ 

Though he said the department 
does not issue "variances," Schmidt 
allowed the RIMAC cart to operate 
the barbeque over the inspector's 
objections. 

"I am willing to grant a waiv-
er on the barbecue location since 
[Chadwick) has offered to upgrade 
the east concession stand, and the 
traffic pattern for hjs daily sales is 
on the upper entrance to RIMAC: 
Schmidt stated in an e-mail to 
Yorkey in early January of 2005. 

It was not the only time Schmidt 
cited history prior to granting 
unusual exceptions. 

In February of this year, Yorkeye-
mailed Schmidt to point out that the 
Vedic Society, which sells the Hare 
Krishna dishes every Wednesday at 
the Student Center, had yet to apply 
for a health permit, though it was 
ordered to do so nearly 13 months 
earlier. Under state law, nonprofit 
food vendors can operate only four 
times a year without obtaining a 
permit. 

"They have really exceeded their 
allowed showings as a nonprofit: 
Yorkey stated. "They are still show-
ing up to sell food [every week]. 
How would you like me to handle 
the situation?-

Schmidt told the inspector to 
contact the student organization in 
charge of the event "to effect per-
mitting and food safety." 

"Educate them on the limits of 
operation required by CURFFL and 
develop a strategy for bringing them 
into compliance, while factoring in 
their historical role of providing the 
only source of vegetarian cuisine

Consutner Values 
at Low, Low Prices 

JENNIFER H SU/CUARDIAN 

As Wal-Mart sells for less, consumers settle for less, every day. 
By Nathan Miklos 

SENIOR STAfF WR ITER 

I n newspaper' columns and blogs, it's been half-jokingly called "the great Satan" and "the most 
famously offensive, town-destroy-
ing, junk-purveying, labor-abusing, 
sweatshop-supporting, American-
job-killing, soul-numbing, hope-cur-
dling retailer in the known universe." 
There are scores of Web sites vigi-
lantly dedicated to keeping tabs on its 
actions. And in the coming months, it 
will be in court facing off against the 
city council of Hercules, Calif., just 
one of a long list of towns that have 
tried to restrict its growth. 

But all the vitriol aimed at WaI-
Mart doesn't stop American consum-
ers from spending close to $250 bil-
lion there every year, more than at all 
other grocery retailers combined. It's 
all part of a love-hate relationship we 
have with Sam Walton's brainchild, 
which is simultaneously a paragon 
of efficiency and a hated symbol of 
corporate manipulation. 

Whether we are prepared for it 
or not, our bipolar romance with the 
Wal-Mart way of life may soon come 
to a head. 

In his autobiography, Walton 
wrote that "the secret of successful 
retailing is to give your customers 
what they want." What customers 
want, he reasoned, are low prices and 
a convenient and pleasant shopping 
experienc.e. Embracing the relatively 
new discount-store business model in 
1962. Walton's stores provided exactly 
that, adopting the motto: ''Always 
Low Prices." 

Before long, punsters subverted 
Ihis slogan into ''Always Low Wages" 
- and often for good reason. In 
California, Wal-Mart's sales clerks 
make an average of $10.37 an hour, 
compared to the state average of 
$14.82 an hour for large retailers. 
The pattern is the same nationwide, 
with a Wal-Mart average wage of 

about $9 an hour compared to the 
national average of $13 an hour for aU 
retailers. [n some states, a year-round 
income at the store is below the U.S. 
poverty threshold, according to www. 
walrnartwatch.com. 

Wal-Mart's compensation pack-
ages are also notoriously lackluster. 
Some labor groups claim that, after 
factoring in nonwage benefits, WaI-
Mart employees make nearly 50 per-
cent less than employees at compa-
rable retailers. 

The company is also known to 
be particularly hostile toward 
unions. Officially, the company 
stance is that because "[WaI-
Mart J believes in maintaining 

percent after Wal-Mart moves into a 
regional market, California grocery 
chains owned by A1bertsons, Safeway 
and Kroger tried to negotiate a two-
year wage freeze with its unions. A 
protracted strike ultimately availed 
the unions little, with new employ-
ees receiving greatly reduced benefit 
packages. 

These pressures mount as 
American wage earners struggle to 
make ends meet. Between 1973 and 
2003, the bottom 40th percentile of 
American workers saw an hourly 

ou can have low 

And while casting "the Wal-Mart 
effect" as a simple either-or is a gross 
oversimplification, it mustrates the 
trade-offs of this system very clearly: 
You can have low prices, or you can 
have high domestic wages. American 
consumers face this choice every day 
- and speaking with their wallets, 
they overwhelmingly choose low 
prices. 

This apparent fIXation with doUars 
and cents raises uncomfortable ques-
tions about our national values. Are 
we making a balanced decision about 

wage-earning versus low pric-
es, or are we simply chasing 
the nickels and dimes? 

A 2004 Forbes article 
framed the problem perfectly: an environment of open com-

munication, we do not believe 
there is a need for third-party 
representation." But labor 
organizers have long argued 
that the lack of collective bar-
gaining at Wal-Mart is one of 
the key factors keeping wages 
low. Several former employ-
ees have alleged that "associ-
ates" are misled or intimidated 
about joining unions. 

The Wal - Mart in 

pnces, or you can have 
high domestic wages. 
American conswners 
face this choice every 
day - and speaking 

"Where you stand on WaI-
Mart ... seema to depend on 
where you sit. If you're a con-
sumer, Wal-Mart is good for 
you. If you're a wage earner, 
there's a good chance it's bad. 
If you're a Wal-Mart share-
holder, you want the company 
to grow. If you're a citizen, 

. you probably don't want it 
growing in your backyard. So, 
which one are you?" 

Jonquierre, Quebec, Canada 
unionized in 2004 - and was 
closed down by the company 
a few months later. A com-
pany spokesman told the New 
York Times that Wal-Mart 
dosed the store because it had 

with their wallets, they 
overwhe~choose 

low prices?' 

Indeed, which one are we? 
The problem is that we are 

usually both. Shoppers enjoy 
Wal-Mart's unbeatable prices, 
even as they cringe at reports 
ofWaI-Mart employees forced 
onto welfare roUs - indeed, 
as Sally Lieber reported in 
the San Francisco. Chronicle, 
Wal-Mart (true to form) has 

lost money since its opening. 
He attributed the store's poor 
performance to "staff division 
over unionizing." 

Wal-Mart denies breaking any 
labor laws. 

It's not just Wal-Mart employ-
ees who find themselves with the 
proverbial wolf at the door. In 2003, 
the mere threat of Wal-Mart expan-
sion in Southern California rippled 
through the grocery retail sector. 
Armed with the knowledge that gro-
cery prices generally drop by 10 to l3 

wage increase of about 7 percent 
- compared to a 28 percent increase 
for the top lO. percent over the same 
time period. American males in the 
bottom 40 percent have actuaUy seen 
a S percent decrease in real wages 
since 1973. 

While it's absurd to single out 
Wal -Mart for the difficulties facing 
wage earners, its model is represen-
tative of a global system of business 
that values profit over well-being. 

a streamlined process for getting its 
employees approved for government 
aid. We all benefit from the respon-
sive worldwide distribution net-
work Wal-Mart has created, but we 
worry about suppliers being bullied 
into hopelesdy unfavorable deals or 
forced to resort to cheaper overseas 
manufacturers. 

How, then, do we reconcile our 
confUcting wants? If ft can't ha~ 

our cake and eat it too, what core 
values do we defend? And aU har-
rumphing about free markets aside, 
do we really prefer $3 gallon-jugs of 
pickJl's over a living wage? 

Fortunately, Wal-Mart's prof-
itability ($Il billion last year) is 
not built exclusively on the backs , 
of wage-eamers. Its pOSition as the 
world's premier retailer allows it to 
leverage suppliers into providing 
some of the best deals consumers 
can get. Wal-Mart also developed a 
pioneering computerized Inventory 
system that directly links Individual 
stores with their suppliers, greatly 
improving the speed and efficiency 
of restocking. 

And Wal-Mart is famous for hold-
Ing its suppliers to notoriously strict 
price and delivery requirements. Even 
disgruntled wholesalers have a sort of 
admiration for the ruthless efficiency 
of the company. 

• ·With a CtIstomer like IWal-Mart), 
it changes your organization - for 
the better," former CEO of Saratoga 
Beverage Group Robin Prever told 
Fastcompany.com. ·It wakes every-
body up. And all our customers 
benefited. We changed our whole 
approach to doing business." 

Ultimately, it is Wal-Mart's effi· 
ciency that has made it successful, 
and its efficiency should be more 
than enough to sustain a healthy 
company. With a near hegemony in 
retail, WaI-Mart doesn't need to pay

Sure, there's nothing inherently 
wrong with paying employees as little 
as they are wiDing to work for. But 
neither is there anything right with 
augmenting shareholder profits at the 
expense of a living wage.

Autonomy Isn't All It's Cracked Up ·to Be LETTERS TO THE EDITOR -
A billcurrentlymovingthrough the state Leplature would extend to coDege journalists 
the same First Amendment protec-
tions already enjoyed by California's 
high school students. There is, how-
ever, one caveat: It wiD not apply to 
the University of California, unless 
the UC Board of 

politicians out. As the Progressives 
eventually realized, you just can't 
take political calculations out of 
politics, 

At the height of the UC Berkeley 
student protests in the 1960s, 
Ronald Reagan made UC Pmident 
Clark Kerr', tenure one of the main 

prongs of his 
Regents decides 
to adopt similar 
protections vol-
untarily. 

"'~""!!'H"'!"a-ts--- gubernatorial 
campaign. After 
Reagan won, the 

The reason is 
autonomy, a pro-
vIsion inserted 
into the California 

off Board of Regents 
sacked Kerr (the 

Vladimir Kogan same board ear-
vkogan@ucsd.edu Iier. impos~d 

anti-communist 
loyalty oaths on faculty). Constitution that essentially insulates 

the university from politics. That pro-
vision exempts the university from 
following any laws the regenU don't 
like, except for the state's open-meet-
ing regulations. 

Understanding the benefits 
- and limits - of autonomy now 
is more important than ever: In 
the face of the UC compensation 
scandal, one lawmaker ha~ proposed 
changing the constitution to s~ow 
that the university is not above the 
law, and others have quietly hinted 
at doing something similar, if the 
university doesn't shape up. 

Though the threats are most like-
ly cheap talk, scrapping UC autono-
my may not be such a bad idea. 

Wbat Autonomy Can't Do 
Formed in the spirit of the 

Progressive Era, the University of 
California is structured around the 
old Progressive ideal of putting spe-
ciaJists in charge of government and 
taking partisans out. For example, 
the regents are appointed for 12-
year terms - longer than the gover-. 
nor who appoints them serves. The 
appointments are staggered, to keep 
one governor from stacking the deck 
in favor of his preferred policie~ 

However, none of these measures 
have been enough to truly keep 

I n recent years, the state 
Legislature has .gotten very good 
about using the power of the purse 
to manhandle the regents. Though 
lawmakers can't teU the regents what 
to do, they can certainly make the 
billions In tax doUars they send to 
the university contingent on spe-
cific policies, and have done so with 
much enthusiasm. 

In fact, the Legislature has even 
gotten involved in decisions about 
admissions: At the height of the 
state budget crisis. lawmakers added 
a special rider to the state budget 
requiring the university to accept a 
specific amount of students, or turn 
up for hearings at the Capitol and 
refund the money. 

Even autonomy, it would seem, 
hasn't been able to keep pernicious 
politicS out. 

Who Neecb It. Anyway' 
Today, the state's Master Plan 

for Higher Education is beralded as. 
an ingenious blueprint that assures 
every California high school student 
a place at a coDege campus. However, 
in the 196Os, the California State 
University (or, more accurately, 
its predecessor, the State Colleges) 
agreed to sign on only after the 
University of California agreed to 

back a constitutional amendment 
giving the state coUege system simi-
1ar autonomy. 

However, legislators were not 
keen on ceding control of more 
institutions, and the proposal was 
defeated even before it could make 
it to a statewide ballot. 

IronicaUy enough, the Master 
Plan was related to autonomy In 
another way: Top UC administrators 
rejected the first chairman appoint-
ed to the committee that would draft 
the plan because they feared that his 
close connections to lawmakers (he 
worked for the Legislative Analyst's 
Office) would allow him to expose 
the various accounting tricks the 
university used to hide its finances 
from the pUblic. 

Indeed, In many ways, autonomy 
has made the university an opaque 
fiefdom ruled by lawlessness; the 
regents. after aU, meet only about 
half a dozen times a year, not nearly 
enough to provide oversight for an 
organization that controls nearly 
$16 billion a year. 

And, of course, having suppos-
edly apolitical regents has not kept 
the university from making politi-
cal decisions. After all, policies that 
govern the use of racial preferences 
In university admissions or about 
investment in Sudan are inherently 
subjective, based on individual pref-
erences and values. 

Instead of having these decisions 
made by an elected Legislature -
still the most representative govern-
ment body in the state, no matter 
what the pitfaUs of democracy may 
be - they are now made by an 
appointed board, made up mostly of 
rich, white men. 

Truth be told,' making the uni-
versity more accountable to the 
state probably 'wouldn't keep future 
pay scandals from happening. But 
it might provide some enterprising 
reporters with enough protection to 
expose them. 

Editorial Unfair to 
.Athletics Referendum 

Dear Editor: 
From aU of my discussions with 

athletes and administrators, I have 
come to realize that the problems in 
the intercollegiate athletics depart-
ment stem from the fact that the 
UCSD community wants our teams 
to perform at a levd that the univer-
sity will not fund Students complain 
about our teams not winning wt.en 
these teams are not given nearly the 
resources competing schools have. 

I am greatly disappointed in the 
eclitorial that ran on May 18 Criticizing 
the idea of a referendum. The intercol-
I.egiate athletics' referendum in 200 I 
was not only supported by a unani-
mous resolution by the A.S. Council, 
but also passed with in unusuaUy high 
percentage of students voting in spring 
elections. Students decided to take the 
steps to move into Division n, students 
got the fee referendum established and 
passed and students passed the fee to 
build RlMAC Arena. 

After student fees went to start fund-
ing RIMAe, the Athletics, Recreation, 
Sports Facilities Advisory Board was 
created, \vhich has eight Wldergraduate 
and two graduate representatives, four 
faculty members. two staff members, 
one alumni representative and four 
nonvoting members. including Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs Joseph 
W Watson. ARSFAB's responsibilities 
include reviewing and evaluating the 
a'thletic programs. program changes 
and other issues that may arise related 
to athletics. To view ARSFAB as a 
strictly facilities-based committee is 
incredibly short -sighted and irTespon-
sible, And while the committee is only 
an advisory committee, it is similar 
in function to the University Centers 
Advisory Board or the Registration Fee 
Advisory Committee, which are also 
concerned with handling student fees. 

I am also disappointed that you 

suggest charging students admission to 
athletic events, when that would only 
be a barrier to improving campus life. 
I am even more disappointed that you 
would say that "if students have money 
with which they are willing to part, the 
AS. Council can surely find a more 
important use for it than athletics." The 
Undergraduate Student Experience 
Satisfaction report SlYS that students 
want traditions and campus-unifying 
events and want to feel part of a col-
lege and not a university. These can 
be aided by a successful athletics pro-
gram, so why shouldn't students sup-
port giving the athletics department 
more money? 

The referendum is an ar,~mpt to 
keep the athletics program in Division 
II by providing fw)ds for the man-
datory grants-in-aid requirement, so 
that the department no longer has to 
operate out of reserves or continue to 
cut where too many cuts have already 
been made. If students want to see 
these improvements, like the U.S.E.S. 
report and past referenda have argued 
they do, then this referendum will 
pass. And I believe that any attempts 
to improve student life and the social 
abnosphere on this campus should be 
encouraged.

Agency Spent .Thousands 
on Bonuses, Audit Says 

• RATES, from page 1 
UCSD borrowers during that time." 

Today borrowers can be charged 
a total of <4 percent in fees - a 1 
percent fee to the guarantor and a 3 
percent origination fee paid to the 
federal government. 

The new law, however, reduc-
es the origination fee for Stafford 
loan borrowers. The legislation fmt 
decreases the amount by 1 percent 
and then lowers it by an addition· 
al 0.5 percent each year until fees 
are eliminated in 2010, which will 
result in an eventual maximum fee 
of.1 percent compared to today's 
amount. 

UCSD Financial Aid Director 
Vincent De Anda stated in an e-mail 
that even with the new fee charges. 

Oakland) revealed questionable fis-
cal practices at the nonprofit loan 
management organization, includ-
ing numerous breaches of policy and 
the failure to take minutes at closed-
aeasion board meetings. 

Calls to Chan's office were not 
retwned. 

Specifically, the audit says 
EdFund spent thousands on execu-
tive bonuses and parties, even while 
the loan program faced an $8.3 mil-
lion operating deficit. 

According to the audit, the pro- . 
gram "may barely break even in 
federal fiscal year 2006.-

The results showed that the 
organization approved $187,500 in 
bonuses during the 2005 federal fis-
cal year and spent nearly 5700,000 

over the last 
five fiscal years 

the effect on stu -
dents would be 
"minimal" and 
that EdFund's 
decision to 
extend the waiver 
period through 
September would 
be helpful to bor-
rowers.

are for?' 

on 14 recep-
tions and 
conferences, 
including room 
and board at

and resorts. 

Furay said 
that EdFund, 
the second -larg-
est loan agency 
in the country, 

·Onlystudents 
who apply late. 
or come in after 
the first quarter, 

- Sally Furay, Chairwoman, 
EdFund Board 

of Directors 
would have to 
pay the fee; he stated. 

UCSD students currently borrow 
about 565 million. according to De 
Anda, which means the fee would 
cost students about $650,000 extr~ 
each year. 

EdFund, which is nine years old, 
had waived the fee for ·the past 
seven years because it had sizable 
budget surpluses used for cover-
ing the fee, according to EdFund 
Board of Directors Chairwoman 
Sally Furay. 

However, because of the state 
budget crhis in 2004, Ed Fund's cof-
fers were depleted by 5200 mil-
lion so California would not have 
to reduce the amount of aid being 
disbursed through its Cal Grant 
programs. Because reserves were 
sucked dry and EdFund is required 
by federal law to have a minimum 
account set aside, the agency made 
the decision to no longer cover the 
fee, Furay said. 

The decision comes after a state 
audit requested earlier this year by 
Assemblywoman Wilma Chan (0-

welcomed the 
audit and that it accepted all 18 of 
the report's recommendations dUr-
ing an April board meeting. 

wThe [state auditor) has a point; 
Furay said. "No organization is per-
fect, and that's what state auditors 
are for. EdFund's policies have now 
been tightened." . 

Furay, however, described the 
bonuses as "incentive compensa · 
tion," and said that EdFund is a per-
formance·based organization. She 
also said that despite the results, 
stude')ts can still trust the loan 
agency. 

In addition, she said tha\ the 
organization would be working hard 
to resolve the problems identified in 
the report. -

The audit, however, says that "the 
Legislature should require [CSAC] 
to dissolve Ed Fund and contract 
with another guarantee agency· 
if EdFund is unable to get its act 
together soon.

ueop Official Allowed Permissive 
. Health Code Interpretations 
~ FOOD, from page 3 
at UCSD:' Schmidt stated in an e-
mail. 

In response to questions, Schmidt 
said the facility has now obtained 
a valid establishment permit from 
the department, and that its opera-
tions never presented a health threat 
because all food sold by the Vedic 
Society had been cooked offsite, in 
an approved facility. 

The approach of UCSD's EHS 
differs drastically from those of 
other -environmental health agen· 
cies, including those at other UC 
campuses. Days before S,hmidt's 
e-mail about the Vedic SOCiety, for 
example, health officials at UCLA 
shut down a similar vendor, operat-
ed by a monk from the International 
Society for Krishna Consciousness, 
after concluding that he could not 
operate more than four times a year 
without a permit. 

According to Darryl Wong, cur-
rent president of the California 
Environmental Health Association 
and a health inspector for San Benito 
County, the issuance of exemptions 
from state law is not unheard of in 
the industry, though they are not 
provided for in CURPFL and u,su-
ally require approval from heads of 
the local health departments. 

"You're walking into • real gray 
area in the law; Wong said in an 

interview. "When you look at the 
law, it's black and white. It's not 
allowed in CURFFL, obviously, and 
they are taking a chance that some-
thing might happen." 

in response to an inquiry, loe 
Adams, the head of enyironmental 
health and safety at the UC Office of 
the President, said each campus had 
wide leeway in ways it interpreted 
and enforced health codes, includ-
ing the issuance of variances. 

"UC procedure allows and 
encourages each campus to oper-
ate very independently; he stated. 
"UCOP does not specify how each 
campus conducts its business as 
longs it is within the law.· 

When asked if the law allowed for 
variances, Adams did not respond.

GO FIGURE' 

~ Percentage increase of 
international students at UCSD 

over the past 10 years. 

Why the key to Black's Beach is one of the most cove'ted 
and elusive objects at UCSD. 

D id I leave it in the lock? Did I lock my door? Did I drop it on the ground?" Revelle . College senior Brandon Kampschuur asks himself. 
borderline paranoid and panicking. He sits 
on his !>oard in the water, preoccupied and 
sweating, but not because the La 10Ua fog is 
beginning to clear, bringing the wannth of 
the emerging morning sun - he has some-
thing else on his mind. As perfect waves 
pass him by, he cannot focus on the glassy 
session at hand, instead worrying about the 
safety of his prized possession. 

The object of Surf Club President 
Kampschuur's anxiety was the t1iree-inch 
piece of metal that is considered to be 
"the most valuable surf key in the U.S." by 
Sport and Recreation Club Director Scott 
Berndes. It is the key to the gate at the top of 
the road at Black's Beach. which is often the 
subject of much attention and urban leg-
end, especiaUy within the surf community. 

So, what's the big deal about this key? 
This question is a no-brainer for any 

surfer or anyone else interested in driv-
ing to the beach. As a world -class break, 
known for its shape and amplification of 
sand-bottomed waves, Black's Beach is 
tucked underneath 3OO-foot cliffs, requir-
ing a strenuous hike down one of several 
cardio-inducing trails to the beach. 

As the manager of the key for the sports 
clubs, Berndes understands the worth of it 
fir'sthand. 

"I\,s been an interesting burden; he said. 
"[t makes me nervous to hold it. I know 
how valuable it is:' 

On many occasions, 
Berndes has been offered 

By Katie Westfall . . . 
Staff Writer les. A~mg the Med'eco 

large sums of money in exchange .for the 
key. even $10,000 in one instance. 

He consistently refuses these offers, 
maintaining the traditional aUocation 
of keys. In the past, keys were usuaUy 
given to residents of La Jolla Farms, San 
Diego lifeguards, select UCSD administra-
tors and leaders and Scripps Institution 
of Oceanography clubs like the Surf Club, 
Ocean Awareness Club and Scuba Oub, as 
well as the UCSD surf team. 

Beyond these groups, however. counter-
feit and unauthorized keys do exist. 

UCSD Police Department Sgt. Edward 
Shinn is one of the infamous figures in the 
urban legends surroundlng the key. His 
nice demeanor and cordial nature paints a 
different picture than the one derived from 
stories of him jumping out of the bushes to 
catch people who have unauthorized keys. 

He has played a major role in the crack-
down on illegal key usage, sparked by 
unauthorized vehicles blocking lifeguard 
access to the beach. Officers park off to the 
side, monitor those that access the gate and 
verify that those entering are authorized 
key holders. 

Shinn said that the illegitimate keys he 
finds are either counterfeit or were reported 
lost or stolen by an authorized person. 

Counterfeiting the key is a difficult 
task. considering how the key is copir. It 
is made from a special-order blank pro-
duced by Medeco, a high-security company 
known for its patented key control system 
that prevents the production of illegal cop-

blank IS only possIble 
through special authorization. 

Yel, some.manage. Th.e most unique key 
that Shinn found was created after someone 
found the shank of a key broken off inside 
the lock. The person had welded the handle 
of another key to the discovered shank. 

Considering the si~nificant spirit of this 
item, the issues then arise: Who authorizes 
its issue, and who should get the privilege of 
possessing the key. 

Recently, these questions have . been 
brought to the surface. Earlier this year, 
the surf team key was confiscated after a 
member was caught using the key after 
drinking. A few months later, the Surf Club 
key was taken after an administrator heard 
that the Surf Club may have been planning 
a surf event involving alcohol. Now, key 
handling has been restricted exclusively to 
UC employees or volunteers. nOl students, 
a policy that has irritated leaders of both the 
surf tearn and Surf Club. 

According to Berndes. these events also 
caused the university to scramble over who 
had real control over issuance. 

It used to be that Mary Cabanding 
Garcia, the records and communications 
manager at the UCSD Police Department, 
had jurisdiction over issuance. But now . 
the privilege belongs to Ginger Truschke 
of the UCSD Real Estate Development 
Department, who has created a written 
agreement defining the terms of key usage. 

"[Cabanding) was very happy to pass 
that responsibility onto somebody else; 
said Shinn, alluding to the stress surround-

ing the key's management. 
The question of privilege gets more 

complicated, however. What qualifies 
someone for this benefit? Is being a good 
surfer, heading a ' dub or just having the 

.connection? Some sports clubs and team 
leaders think that possession of the key pro-
vided an important perk for running their 
community-based organizations. 

"There is a lot of work that goes into 
running the club and the team that nobody 
is getting paid for, and we are aU students 
that have other stuff going on; said ReveIJe 
College junior Nate Kauffman, the next Surf 
Cluli president "If you are putting hours 
into a [surf) rec. club, a nonprofit organiza-
tion ... I think that it is a good incentive to 
offer the leaders of those organizations:' 

Because of their rarity and benefit, sto-
len keys are not uncommon, according to 
Berndes, and he always emphasizes that 
point to key holders. 

"[ tell them every year that the bushes 
have eyes, that the hills ha~ eyes." he said. 

In one incident, thieves broke into cars, 
leaving CDs and wallets untouched, instead 
snatching the one item they came for : the 
key. 

Even though the key was used harmo-
niously within the Surf Oub before it was 
confiscated, Kampschuur and Kauffman 
jokingly compared the key to the ring in 
the "Lord of the Rings; reflecting on how 
it can bring out the negative elements of 
human nature. 

"The key is too powerful and too much 
of a gift for anyone person to control; 
Kauffman said. 

TUESDAY,.:MAY 30, 2000" \ 

There is something to be said for a bookstore with an old-
fashioned fire hose by the register and an old gas pump in the 
middle of the room. Clearly, this is no ordinary store. There is no 
"bestseller" display in the center, nor catchy signs designed to lure 
bargain-hunters in to throw money at great deals. Yet it's hard not 
to be drawn inside by the shelves overstuffed with old classics and 
new favorites, antiques placed throughout the store and walls lined 
with photographs of the many famous writers and poets who have 
visited. Mere seconds spent inside will confirm that D.G. Wills Books 
is truly a booklover's dream come true. 

Here, old leather-bound books with yellowing pages and faded 
gold letters down their spines sit beside new paperbacks with crisp 
white pages - a testament to the continuity and timelessness of 
literature. Known for its collection of old-fashioned and scholarly 
books, D.G. Wills has become an oasis for local intellectuals and 
anyone with a sense of curiosity or a taste for the unusual. . 

As the pictures on the walls confirm, countless famous writers, 
artists and professors have visited or spoken at the store. Although 
on normal days the store may appear to be cozily cramped, with 
some minor rearrangements, it has actually accommodated crowds 
approaching SOO people. (Allen Ginsberg was its largest success, with 
"a crowd that spilled out the front doors and onto the street.) 

The store is so charming, in fact. that Fran~oise Gilot - an 
artist who lived-with Pablo Picasso for a number of years - used 
to frequent it because it reminded her of Paris. A photograph of 
her comfortably sitting in the store, taken by the Parisian edition 
of Vogue, is proudly displayed in the center of the room alongside 
photographs taken of famous actors, Nobel Prize winners and best-
selling authors who have also visited. 

The store is the perfect place to spend a lazy day or to begin 
the search for an uncommon or unusual book. Overstuffed shelves. 
oriental carpeting and classical music create the perfect atmosphere 
for anyone with an inclination to thumb through Proust's novels. 
peruse Newton's writings or begin reading Persian poetry (translated. 
or not). A welcome break from the chains of bookstores to which we 
have grown so acc-ustomed, D.G. Wills is more of an experience than 
a store.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN TUESDAY, MAY 30, 2006 

New Inspector Gave Restaurants Lower Grades 
• GRADE$, from page 7 
business millaaer wu involved in 
acbedullna inlpectiolU, EHS spe-
clali.t Bruce Bowen forwarded her 
requat on to Yorby. (Bowen is 
Yorkey's Immediltc .uperYilor.) 

Usua1ly, inlpecdona are carried 
out at random times, to .. ure thIt 
the health department reviewa facil-
ities in their moat repraentative 
.tate. Committing to carrying out 
the inspections on the same day 
would effectively give the operator 
prior warning, Yorkq pointed out 
in his response. 

MIs this a request that we are 
going to commit tofU Yorby ubd 
Bowers in an e-mail. "Are we going 
to ecbeduJe inspectionaf" 

According to the document., 
Bowers did not respond, and Yorkq 
continued to issue further objec: 
tions. 

MAre we going to start honor-
ing these types of requests?" Yorkq 
asked In another e-mail "I am sure 
you realize that if we honor this type 
of request and give prior notice to 
the owner of a facility even in this 
way, the observations 'of a ' routine' 
inspection will be biased." 

Wong, the head of the CEHA, 
said schedulina inspections in such 
a way is uncommon among health 
inspectors. 

"It's really at the convenience of 
the inspector, not at the convenience 
of the operator," he said. "We can go 
in at any time we want - that's what 
having a permit means.· 

Bowers did not respond ' to 
requests for comment, and Schmidt 
denied that the inspections had been 
scheduled ~ead of time, though he 
pointed out that doing so would 
likely not have affected their valid-
ity. 

MI am not aware of Illy such 
requests being honored; Schmidt 
stated in an e-mail. 

'An Ovemisht C ..... e' 
Prior to Yorkey's biring in fall of 

2004, all of the inspections - except 
for a short break in 2003 - had 
been carried out by Bowers. When 
Yorkey took over, scores of almost 
every single facility dropped, with 
11 eateries receiving the lowest 'C' 
grade. • 

In some cases, Yorkey appar-
ently discovered facilities that had 
not previously been inspected, like 
the kitchen at Eleanor Roosevelt 
College's Great Hall. In various 
locations, Yorkey documented 
long-standing violations - like 
the absence of a certified manager 
or lack of hot water - that had 
apparently been missed for years by 
Bowers. 

For example, when Bowers 
inspected the CUPS Cafe in June of 
2004, he noted only one violation -
an expired fire extinguisher - and 
gave the facility a score of 99 points, 
out of a 100. Four months later, 
Yorkey's inspection noted more than 
10 health-code violations, and the 
facility's score feU to 81.

: at ALEX'S SALOM :

According to Schmidt, the 
change wu due more to the way the 
department's new .coring method 
worked, and Jess to the change in 
inspecton, 

"As discusaed in our previous 
interview, the new tqJClltinsIlCOring 
system imposed by the state (the only 
tool used at UCSD by Mr. Yorby) is 
radically different than our previous 
system (the only tool used by Mr, 
Bowen until now)," Schmidt stated in 
III e-mail. "Thus. comparisons of old 
system scores with the new syatem 
scores are not valid." 

However, according to milly food 
vendon, the department's standards 
have also chillged, 

"Frommypenpective,thelnspec-
tion standards have been stricter in 
the enforcement; said Goodrich, 
the facilities director at the medical 
center. "And rightfully so." 

Chadwick, the head of the ath-
letic facilities, initially reacted more 
angrily. 

"While we are very interested 

, f we ••. give prior 
notice ... the observa-

tions of a 'routine' 
inspection will be 

biased." 
- Darryl Yorkey, Inspector, 

UCSD Dept of Environment, 
Heahh and Safety 

and 'committed to complying with 
necessary food safety regulations, 
I am concerned that a change in 
personnel has affected what appears 
to be an overnight change in campw 
standards, EHS practice and compli-
ance strategy; he stated in e-mail to 
Schmidt. 

'Who Did the Gradina" 
On Feb. 13 of this year, a Monday, 

Yorkey arrived to his office to fmd 
all of the food-facility files gone 
and III e-mail from Bowers, sent 
the night befor~: "Effective imme-
diately, I will be assuming the duties 
of the campus food-facility inspec-
tion program and temporary food 
booth program on campus .... With 
the exception of food -facility plan 
review, you are not to have any 
interaction with the campus food 
facilities unless instructed to do so." 

Schmidt painted the change as a 
simple administrative decision. 

"Our sanitation inspection pro-
gram has many elements, and we 
are fortunate to have two registered 
inspectors, Mr. Yorkey and Mr. 
Bowers," he stated in an e-mail. "At 
this time, Mr. Bowers is responsible 
for the food-safety program, and 
Mr. Yorkey is responsible for the 
housing, pools, water-quality and 
recycled-water programs." 

A weeJc earlier, Benedict, the head 
of EHS, sent an apologetic e-mail to 

Vice CbancelIor of Business AfIIin 
Stephen W, Relyea, warning him 
that a copy of the Hillcrest inIpec-
lion bad been requeated under the 
California Public Recorda Act. 

"Just a beads up that the Medical 
Center kitchen at Hillcrest Iw been 
graded ... a 'D," Benedict stated. 
"We're wing all necesaary resources 
to bdp the vendor, Aramark, bring 
the kitchen up to an 'A: ... I wanted 
you to know in cue it ends up in 
the news." 

The vice chancellor responded 
by uking: "Who did the gradina 
of the med ctr. kitchen?" Benedict 
said It had been done by Yorby and 
Bowen, and that "under the code 

. it couldn't have been scored differ-
ently." Seven days later, Yorkey was 
no longer doing inspections. 

According to one source, grant-
ed anonymity because the official 
wu not authorized to comment on 
behalf of the university, Relyea had 
previously played a role in staffing 
decisions at iHS. In 2003, emer-
gency-preparedness planner Garrett 
McLeish wu demoted to the position 
of food inspector, after critiCizing 
the state of the university's emer-
gency-preparedness program, the 
source said, and the vice chancellor's 
office was involved. Mcleish left six 
months later. 

Schmidt denied that Relyea had 
any role in either staffing move, and 
said the vice chancellor expects all 
of "his managers to comply with all 
applicable codes." Relyea's office said 
he was out of the state last week and 
unavailable for comment, and he did 
not respond to questions submitted 
via e-mail. 

What is unique about the situa-
tion is that Relyea oversees both EHS 
and Housing and Dining Services, 
the department that operates many 
of the eateries inspected by Bowers 
and .Yorkey. Under the funding pro-
cess used by the university, a part of 
H&DS profits also go to fund EHS. 

According to Schmidt, profits 
from dining facilities provide less 
than 5 percent of the total EHS 
budget of S6 million, though the 
amount Is still more than the com-
bined salaries of Bowers and Yorkey, 
the two inspectors. 

Asked whether the arrangement 
represented an inherent conflict of 
interest, Schmidt said, "No, EHS 
regulates every division of UCSD 
(labs, clinics, shops, offices, hous-
ing, dining, etc.) so where we report 
is immaterial." 

Schmidt also explained that he 
had full confidence in Bowers' abil-
ity to take over his old inspection 
duties from Yorkey. 

"I am not aware of any major vio-
lations missed by Mr. Bowers in the 
past," Schmidt stated in an e-mail. 
"And, considering his extensive 
knowledge base and experience in 
the food-safety field, I am confident 
he will exceed our expectations."

UNDER THE WATCHFUL EYE 

R'L EY SALANT-PEARCE/CUARDIAN 

UCSD STUDENTS MAY HAVE TO FACE A HIGH PRICE FOR 
POLICY VIOLATIONS: THEIR E-MAIL PRIVACY 

By Andrcw Nguym 
- SENIOR STAff WRITFR 

Reading your e-mail is usually a 
private experience between you and 
the spammer that sent you that ad 
for the natural Viagra alternative. 
However, for UCSD students, that 
experience can be shared with the 
university administration, too: Even 
if you delete your e-mail, UCSD 
administrators can gain access to 
the ucsd.edu e-mail address pro-
vided to each student so long as they 
are authorized to do so by certain 
vice chancellors. 

With a soph isticated system of 
backups that allow the retrieval of 
e-mail even after it's been deleted. 
Academic... Computing Services, 
the campus department that man -
ages the e-mail system, and UCSD 
administrators could theoretically 

go through e-mails looking for 
instances of students breaking the 
law or university policy. What keeps 
them from doing so is the University 
of California's electronic communi -
cations policy, which focuses on 
"privacy, confidentiality and secu-
rity in electronic communications." 
The policy spells out the circum -
stances under which a user's e-mail 
account can be viewed without his 
or her consent. 

At UCSD, the policy requjres 
authorization from Vice Chancellor 
of Student Affairs Joseph W. 
Watson or Senior Vice Chancellor 
of Academic Affairs Marsha A. 
Chandler in order for an e-maiJ 
account to be inspected without the 
user's consent. The user must be 
notified of any such inspection . 

According to the Annual Reports 
on Nonconsensual Access to E-mail, 

between 2000 and 2004, UCSD 
requested authorization 12 times to 
access a user's e-mail without con-
sent, arid II of these ·requests were 
approved. In those cases, adminis-
trators sought to find out whether 
the user was breaking a law based 
on prior evidence, or there were 
"time-dependent, critical operation -
al circumstances." were the reasons 
cited in the reports. 

Since users often delete e-mails 
to avoid running out of space in 
their mailbox, ACS developed a 
system that enables the retrieval 
of mistakenly deleted e-mail. ACS 
takes "snapshots· of the deleted e-
mails at various times throughout 
the day - no less than twice per day 
- and can use those "snapshots· to 
restore e-mails that someone may

Internet Server Also Links USC and Stanford 
• PRIVACY, from page 11 
need. 

Using a system of multiple hard 
drives for a seven -terabyte array 
that is then backed up to tapes, the 
data go quite a while back. Students 
or staff members can contact ACS 
to restore e-mails and, according to 
ACS Director Tony Wood, they're 
even used for disputes between fac-
ulty and students over grades. 

Since UCSD started providing 
e· mail service in the early 19805. 
the number of e·mails that stream 
through the servers has increased 
to about 1 miUion a day. Out of all 
the messages that come into UCSD's 
e-mail servers. anywhere from 30 
to 50 percent are spam, depending 
on the user's habits. Five percent of 
all e-mails contain viruses. Because 
of this, ACS has servers dedicated 
to keeping-viruses and spam oul of 
users' mailboxes. 

The UCSD Internet link isn't an 
ordinary connection: II's a massive 
optical pipeline that connects all 
Ihe campuses of the University of 
California, as well as Stanford, the 
University of Southern California. 
Caltech and olher universities. The 
conneclion is purchased through the 
Corporation for Education Network 
Initiatives in California - of which 
UCSD is a central backbone - for 
SI6O.000 a year. according to Wood, 

which pays for membership fees and 
Internet2 access. 

UCSD also purchases access to 
the Internet through CENIC mea-
sured by bandwidth use. at a cost 
of an !ldditional S 1 0,000 per month 
on average. 

The Internet connection Isn't 
solely paid for by students; the state 
helps to pay for Internet connec-
tions used for more instructional 
purposes. while students pay for the 
wireless network, the wired connec-
tions in the residential areas and the 
computer labs. 

Once that conneclion gets to 
UCSD, according to Wood, it's 
divided up between 45,000 wired 
I P addresses, which connect about 
the same number of computers. and 
15,000 monthly wireless users. All 
of these computers share a connec-
tion that has a bandwidth of about 
50 megabits per second - in other 
words. way faster then your connec-
tion at home. 

With all that bandwidth, users 
can usually go about their business 
with no problems. It 's only when 
someone is using a large amount of 
bandwidth that ACS is alerted. 

UnusualJy large uses of band-
width are almost always caused 
by hackers attempting to send out 
spam or viruses, or by the use of 
peer-to-peer file-sharing software to 

upload and download large num-
bers offales. In the former case. ACS 
will just shut down the connection 
and repair the computer. The latter 
case. however, is more complicated. 
If a user is using so much bandwidth 
that it interferes with nearby users' 
connection. ACS will implement a 
rate limiter that slows down how 
much the individual can use at one 
time. 

Usage. not conten.t, is monitored 
and even then only in UCSD resi-
dential areas. When it comes to ACS 
involvement, it's not what you're 
downloading, it's how much you're 
downloading. 

If ACS receives evidence that a 
user is committing or has commit· 
ted a violation of its acceptable use 
policy, including copyright infringe-
ment and violation of federal, state 
or campus regulation, Ihen it must 
take action. Usually after a warning 
for the first violation, ACS stops the 
connection for a period of time and 
refers .the student to his or her rei · 
evant college judicial board. 

With e -maH approved as an offi · 
cial form of university communica-
tion and near· universal access to 
the Inlernet around campus, the UC 
system has had to create a policy 
that views e -maH and Internet usage 
as an important component of daily 
life - just so long as users behave.

Capote 
·CAPOTE- is not just a Hollywood bio of 
Truman Capole, one of the most famous 
writers of the 20th century. It is also one of 
the great films about the process of writing 
and how the subject of what one is writing 
can arrect the writer so deeply. The book 
was "In Cold Blood ," considered one of the 
finesl non-fiction books ever wri[(~n. The 
movie begins in 1959 as Capote (PHILLIP 

SEYMOUR HOFFMAN) woos the Manhattan intellectual crowd and 
basks in the success' of "Breakfast al Tiffany'S." He feels the need 
to pursue something non-ficlion, and finds it when he reads about 
the brutal slaying of a family in Kansas by two killers. The killers 
are apprehended and Truman sees the potential for a New Yorker 
magazine article, something to delight his friends. Capote visits 
Kansas with Harper Lee (Catherine Keener). author of "To Kili a 
Mockingbird." He wants 10 see the mutilated bodies and hear grisly 
details. even from the murderers. He gets what he asked for, and the 
changes his soul undergoes are a chilling revelation. Hoffman won 
the·2005 Oscar for best actor. Admission $3. Presented by University 
Centers.

also been tutorintl at the Office of 
Academic Support and Instructional 
Services and leading a Math 20C

for two boun twice a week. The

"' remember at one point in the 
winter I realized I had not been

entire TV show. and that was very

pfCllurea of her schedule.

Raffel added that Spencer's con-
tributions have been extraordinary. 

"Jenny's sports and leadership 
experience made her a good role 
model for this group of students,' 
Raffel said. "Sbe created Sames that 
motivated her .tudents to work 
together positively. Thil i. quite an 
achievement. because these students 
are adept at hiding their lad of 
knowledge by choosing to object 
to everything. My experience with 

interns has been good. but now 
Jenny has set a much higher bar." 

After moving around a lot when 
she was younger due to her father's

to not knowing what she' II be doing 
next month, let alone next year. she 
will be starting a masters program

every intention of remaining in San

When asked if she has any regrets 
about the rigorous schedule she put 
herself through, Spencer says no 
immediately.

said. "' think I'm better for it."

HOT CORNER 

Briana Hinga 
Women's Track and Field 

The senior javelin thrower beat her own 
school record with a toss of 159 feet , 1 inch 

at the NCAA Division-II track and field 
championships on May 27. 

Track and Field Teams Fight Valiantly at Finals 
Women's team places 
in 18th behind Hingas 
performance, men 
take 33rd at NCAA 
championships. 

By Brent Westcott 
CONTR IBUTING WRITER 

The UCSD men's and women's 
track and field teams didn't bring 
just a team to the NCAA Division-
II championships this year - they 
brought an army. 

. With a chool record of 16 ath-
letes qualifying to participate in the 
fi nal meet of the year, the Tritons had 
high hopes that this would be one of 
their most successful meets ever, and 
to head coach Tony alerno's delight , 
they didn't disappoint. 

The women could not improve 
on their best finish in chool hi tory 
from last year, but this year's 18th 
place finish on the women' side and 
33rd place for the men did not faze 
·alerno. 

"To have 16 athletes qualify and 
to compete the way we did was 
amazmg:' Salerno said. 

There were everal bright spots 
in the event but none were brighter 
than senior javelin thrower Briana 
Hinga, who beat her own school 
record with a throw of 159 feet, I 
inch. 

That distance was good enough 
to land her in third place and secure 
her All-American status. 

Salerno said he was extremely 
pleased with Hinga's composure and 
performance. 

"To - have Briana set a school 
record during her first trip to 
nationals is an outstanding accom-
plisliment," Salerno said 

Hinga may have been the most 
exceptional' Triton athlete at the 
meet, but four other women also 
received All - American status. 
Sophomore hurdler Laiah Blue was 
able to secure her award by finishing 
fLfth in the 100-meter hurdles with a 
time of 13.88 seconds. 

Salerno said he was proud of 
Blue's time conSidering the high-
quality competition in the race. 

"The race was an extremely com-
petitive one with the winner run-
ning at a world -class time," he said. 

Senior Mimi Hodgins may have 
been the mo t anticipated Triton 
runner at the event, as she looked 
to improve last year's national run-
ner-up status in the 800. Hodgins 
ran well but wa only able to place 
eventh with a time of 2 minutes, 

16.63 seconds. 
Hodgins may have been disap-

pointed, but Salerno was not. 
"Mimi ran a great race under 

tough conditions and earned her 
All -American status for the second 
year in a row," he said. 

A pair of standout Triton young-
sters made quite an impression in 
the women's discus. 

Freshman Sarah Hendy earned 
All -American honors by finishing 
eighth with a throw of 147 feet, 1 
inch . She was jOined by her fresh-
man teammate Jillian Sola, who fin-
ished in 17th place. 

Both Hendy's and Sola's perfor-
mances impressed Salerno, who 
expects the throwing pair to be 

dominant for the Tritons over the 
next three years. 

"There were only four freshmen 
in the women's discus and we fea-
tured two of the strongest," Salerno 
said. "They are two of our future 
stars." 

The women may have been the 
standouts at this year's event, but the 
men held their own with two ath-
letes earning All-American honors 
in the same event. 

Speedy seniors Mike Cunningham 
and Jon Patton finished fourth and 
sixth, respectively, in the 400 hurdles. 
Cunningham ran a time of 51.52 
seconds, narrowly beating out Patton, 
who finished with a time of 51.99 
seconds. 

Although they did not qualify for 
All-American honors, the women's 
4x4 relay leam put on quite a show 
in their race. 

The' team of senior Sandy 
Schaefer, freshman Katie Skorupa, 
junior Elisa Holiday and sophomore 
Amber Green ran a new school 
record time of 3:48.22, but that mark 
only earned the team fifth place in 
it heat. alerno expects his team to 
improve in the event next year. 

"We produced a new school 
record and we have three of the ath-
letes retuming next year, with the 
exception of Sandy, who finished up 
a great career," he said. 

When all was aid and done at 
the championships, the Tritons were 
proud to have six All-Americans, a 
fact that Salerno says urns up this 
year's success. 

·We had six All-A mericans this 
year; that is more than most other 
schools even qualify," he said.

Spencer's Contributions Reach Beyond the Diamond 
The senior outfielder 
led Triton softball team 
in nine categories while 

. balancing a tutoring 
job and schoolwork.

Jenny Spencer is one of many 
UCSD student-athletes who bring 
something to the campus that might 
not be visible on a daily basis. Since 
UCSD athletics don't attract large 
fan bases, Spencer's contributions on 
the softball field may be overlooked, 
and her extra-curricular activities 
also don't garner the attention they 
deserve. She is a softball player at a 
school that does not offer the chance 
for monetary compensation for ath-
letics, despite the fact that she, like 
many other Tritons, has the ability 
to earn such a scholarship. However, 
Spencer has spent her collegiate 
career doing more than just catching 
pop-ups and stealing bases. 

During the 2006 season, Spencer, 
a senior centerfielder, led the Triton 
softball team in nine ·offensive cat-
egories, including marks of 66 hits, 15 
doubles, five home runs and 14 stolen 
bases, numbers that put her among 
the all-time single season leaders in 
those categories. She doubled her 
career triples, more than doubled 
career home runs and continued 
the amazing upward bound in every 
single offensive category, ending her 
career among the UCSD leaders in 
six different categories. 

"When you tell her she can't do 
something, she will try to prove you 
wrong in every way possible," said 
head coach Patti Gerckens, who has 
helmed the Triton squad for the past 
14 years. "She is one of the most 
competitive people I've ever had on

total on the team, this year. 

"HonettIy, I go up to bat, 1 see a
