PART ONE OF A TWO-PART SERIES ON PARKING AT UCSD

A newly released report presents 
a 10-year plan aimed at improving the 

UCSD's 'tenuous' parking situation 

ne look at the line of cars 
behind the North Parking 
shuttle on a typical weekday 
morntng is enough 
to convince anyone 
that UCSD's parking situa-
tion is reaching a critical stage. 

Some students question the number of 
available parking spaces. Others say they 
loathe the long distances between park-
ing lots and classrooms. No matter whom 
you talk to, everyone has something to 
say. 

' 'I'm always having to follow people 
aroundjust to find a parking space," Muir 
senior Mary Huynh said. 

"There are enough parking spaces but 
they ' re so far away from the damn 
cIa es ," Marshall freshman Gabriel 
Pascual said. 

Still others have become disenchanted 
with parking on campus altogether. The-
ater Lecturer Todd Salovey said walking 
the nearly two miles from his home to 
school is far easier than dealing with 
campus parking. 

In an effort to deal with these con-
cerns, as well as to prepare for future 
parking dilemmas, Transportation and

Axe 500-700 
Positions 
LAYOFFS: Administration 
says cuts are part of larger 
restructuring plan 
By Terry Lew 
Associate News Editor 

Several dozen oflhe UCSD Medical Center's 
3.700 staff employees gathered Friday to confront 
the possibility of 500-700 layoffs, and an addi-
tional 200 jobs given to an outside. contractor by 
university administrators. 

The two discussion sessions were led by offi-
cials from the American Federation of State, 
County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) 
union. 

"Five-hundred to 700 people i a horrendous 
number of people," AFSCME District Council 57 
Director George Popyack said. "You can figure 
out for yourself that if there are going to be that 
kind of layoffs in this hospital system, virtually 
every department is going to be hit with some-
thing." 

Popyack added that the UCSD Medical Center 
in Hillcre I. which opened in 1963 as the San 
Diego County General Hospital. needs to find its 
place in the 21 st-century health-care sy tern. 

"Every hospital in this country has got to find 
a niche that they can capture and exploit," he said. 
"Nobody is particularly interested in quality of 
care anymore, and it's probably a sign of how far 
we've had to sink just to survive." 

Popyack added that the union has no details 
aboul the layoffs, "other than that 's the number 
(management] tos ed Ollt." 

Union leaders also contested' the 
administration' possible decision to contract out 
200 housekeeping and nutrition employees' jobs 
to ARAMARK, which provide institutional cus-
tomers with support services ranging from cafete-
rias to uniforms. 

"What ARAMARK is proposing is to pay 
people substantially less money and no benefits, 
therefore reducing the cost of environmental ser-
vice , food services and linen approximately $1.3 
million per year," Counci l 57 business agent Keith 
Uriate aid. 'Tho e 200 job are not going to ave 
the hospital. That' just a drop in the bucket."

Laguna Beach Woman Carjacked at La Jolla Mobil Gas Station 
CRIME: Assailant 
releases woman near 
U.S.-Mexico border 
By Iy ... DelYenthal 
News Editor 

A 55-year-old Laguna Beach 
. woman wa carjacked by a "pleas-

ant" man Fnday afternoon at the 
Mobil ga. stallon near UCSD on La 
Jolla Village and Villa La Jolla 
Drives. 

The woman. who was in town 

visiting her on, had just finished 
pumping gas at approximately 3 p.m. 
Friday and was about to reenter her 
1994 Toyota 4-Runner when she 
was approached from behind by an 
assailant, who stuck a pointy object 
in her side. 

"I gassed up, checked the oi I and 
unlocked the car and started geui ng 
back In and this guy came nght up 
next to me and said, 'You won ' t get 
hurt if you do what I say, '" the 
woman said. "I argued with him a 
liule bit, but I realized he was seri-

ou ." 
The woman got into the car and 

moved from the driver's seat to the 
passenger seat. hoping to exit the 
car through the passenger door. 
However, the man locked all the car 
door from the driver's side and 
demanded the key to the car. After 
a brief argument, the woman gave 
her keys to the man. 

"I thought omeone in the gas 
statIon would notice that I had come 
alone," she said. "But no one did." 

The man then headed southbound 

on Interstate 5 until taking the final 
U.S. exit in San Ysidro. Once there, 
he released the woman unhurt at an 
outlet mall on Camino de la Plaza 
near Louisiana A venue. The woman 
called 91 r from a Nike outlet store. 

During the 30-minute ride to the 
border, the captor told the woman 
that he had been through ome "re-
ally bad times." 

"He was telling me that he ... had 
been living on the street , had lost 
his apartment, his girlfriend had left

SOUSED?: Producers pull plug on allegedly 
intoxicated Andy Dick halfway through act 
By Orace Jan, 
Staff Writer 

1lle second-annual Raging Rum-
pus event, organized by Revelle' s 
Emerging Leaders Program (ELP). 
failcd to tum out as expected Friday 
night, when an allegedly intoxicated 
Andy Dick - who stars in NBC's 
"Newsradio" show - cursed at the 
Price Center audience and told "raun-
chy jokes." event organizers said. 

Dick took the stage aftcr the first 
two musical acts of the evening. 
Naked Jumples and Chin up, which 
played before an estimated crowd of 
800 in the Price Center Plaza. 

Rumpus organizers asked Dick 
to leave the stage 20 minutes into his 
scheduled 45-minute performance 
when his jokes "goc profanc and 
offensi ve," ELP Oversight Commit-
tee Chair Umesh Tiwari said. 

"In adult comedy. there is some 
tasteful profanity, but [Dick) was 
outright offensive," Tiwari added. 
"He and his friends thought the per-
formance was funny ... but his racist, 

hO~lOphobic jokcs were out of con-
text," 

According to Tiwari. before the 
show Dick and his friends purchased 
some "last-minute supplies," which 
included 12 watermelons. clam 
chowder and $300 worth of liquor at 
Ralph's grocery store. The fruit and 
soup were props for Dick's act, but 
the liquor was used to "party" at 
Dick's hotel room three hours be-
fore he was scheduled to perform. 

Following the show, ELP rene-
gotiated its $4.000 contract with 

Dick. However. ELP picked up the 
tab for Dick's hospitality fees. which 
included expenses for room. board. 
ground transportation and airfare. 

"Professional comedy is really ex-
pensive," Tiwari said. "But money 
doesn ' t necessarily buy quality. We 
ordered prime rib and got rotten 
Spam." 

Tiwari and fellow ELP members 
noted that Dick acted nothing I ike his 
character "Matthew." 

Dick was unavailable for com-
ment. 

According to Tiwari , 45 students 
spent four months preparing the rec-
reational program for "bored" UCSD 
students. The event was sponsored 
by the Associated Students. college 
councils and organizations such as EI 
Torito and the LaJolla BrewingCom-
pany. Raging Rumpus' proceeds from 
rame-ticket sales benefited the envi-
ronmental organization, I Love a 
Clean San Diego. 

Despite Dick's "raunchy jokes" 
and allegedly intoxicated perfor-
mance. many students said they en-
joyed the Rumpus. 

Most students had expected a 
larger audience. given the free ad-
mission and extensive pUblicity. 

"[The bands) were really good, 
but they deserved a much bigger au-
dience," Revelle freshman Joshua 
Rhodes said. 

Chin up drummer Chad Butler 
commended ELP on the organiza-
tion of the event. 

"Overall, it was a super-positive 
Rumpus." Butler said.

TIx:y've had ambassadors. They've 
had who knows what, and what has 
been the effect of that? NOthing." 

However. UCSD Health Sciences 
Communications Director Leslie 
Franz said the layoffs "are not taking 
plal:e in a vacuum" and are in fact part 
of UCSD Healthcare' s ongoing reor-
ganization and restructuring efforts .. 

Franz atlded that the issues facing 
UCSD are the same ones facing hos-
pitals across the country. 

"Our system. like many other sys-
tems. is having a hard time being 
financially successful. given all the 
changes that have gone on in health 
care in the last few years," she said. 
'The trend throughoulthe country is 
that there are fewer people in hospi-
tals. and when they are in the hospital. 
they're in the hospital for less time." 

The impending layoffs are not signs 
of management's capriciousness. 
Franz said. 

"It's a much bigger initiative than 
simply trying to cut costs and trying to 
cut staff." she said. "What's going on 

is not arbitrary, and it's not poorly 
planned. In fact, it's the exact oppo-
site." 

The Hunter Group, a San Diego 
health-care consulting finn retained 
by UCSD Vice Chancellor of Health 
ScienceJohn A1ksnein February 1996, 
is expected to recommend the layoffs

However, Franz denied that the hos-
pital is in dire straits and reaffirmed its 
restructuring plan. 

"I don't know where they goc that 
figure," she said. "The Hunter Group is 
here to help the system redesisn itself SO 

that it can be in a provement plan" 
for UCSD 
Healthcare in 
early May. 

"At that time. 
we will be in a

current way of looking at things." 

For example, while in the late 
1800s many scientists were experi-
menting with new and elaborate 
ways of harnessing candle light , 
Thomas Edison invented the light 
bulb. And while in the early I 980s. 
most people were content with the 
nightly news, Ted Turner started 
CNN, a revolutionary 24-hour news 
station. Paradigm . then. are the 
traps from which true innovators 
escape, eventually to create new 
paradigms of their own. 

After witnessing the results of 
lasl week's Associated Students 
general elections - and after inter-
viewing all Ihe candidates for the 
Guardian special election issue -
1 wish , more than ever, that the can-
didates had dads like mine growing 
up . Countless tonurous hours spent 
talking with these future politicians 
convinced me that breaking free of 
current A.S. paradigms is the far-
thesl thing from their minds. 

In fact, most of the candidates 
tended to fit into one of three rigid 
categories: resumMillers, perry dic-
tators and, for lack of a beller term, 
" the confused." The Guardian in-
terviews, which are the basis for my 
observations, were hardl y "feet 10 
the fire" affairs. They con isted of 
peppering the candidates with a few 
basic questions about their back-
ground, future goals and views on 
campus issues. However, the an-
swers 1 heard left me wondering if 
these candidates were really running 
for UCSD offices or for student-
council positions al La 10lla Coun-
try Day. 

Of all the candidates. the 
resume-fillers were the most para-
doxical. Candidates of this type 
seemed to be caught in a vicious 
cycle of logic - a cycle many 
graduating UCSD seniors will soon 
become familiar with: "I can't get a 
job because 1 have no work experi-
ence. but how can 1 get work expe-
rience if I can' t gel a job?" These 
resume-filling candidates, similarly. 
wanted to be voted inlo office so that 
they could supposedly "do some-
thing for students" - even though 
they had never tried to do anything 
for students in the past. 

And their qualifications were 
laughable al best. One candidale 
running for commissioner of aca-
demic affairs seemed [0 think that 
"good grades" was Ihe only prereq-
uisite for the job. Another candidate 
running for commissioner of student 
advocacy was convinced that being 
"interested in philosophy" meant 
guaranteed qualification for Ihe of-
fice . These candidates were the least 
likely to look outside the normal 
A.S. paradigm. They were simply 
running to add anolher line under 
"Work Experience." 

The second set of candidates, the 
petty dictators, made up the major-
ity of those running. Their attitudes 
- which were prevalent in A.S. 
Council chambers thi s year, starting 
from the top - reminded me of pre-
vious summers [ spent on Calalina 
Island. How, you may ask? Well. on 
Catalina Island. every little cove and 
tiny inlet has a pon authority and a 
local guy-in-charge. As long as you 
don ' t cut across his cove, you ' re 
fi ne. But as soon as one ripple dis-
rupts his area, the guy-in-charge 
beco mes more territorial than a 
mounlain lion munching on a way-
ward jogger. 

These dictatorial A.S. candidates 
were the same way. Like mini -
Mussolini 's full of focused rhetoric,

The last group of 
A.S. contenders 
could only be called 
'the confused' 
because many of 
them honestly didn't

running. During one

model," one candidate said, "not 
her." These kind of candidates had 
years of experience on various pan-
els and committees. They pointed to 
a record of "meaningful" speeches 
and resolutions, ones very similar 
to the proposal against hate crimes 
brought up at last week's council 
meeting. (I can hear the peanut gal-
lery now: "You mean the council is 
not in favor of hate crimes? Who 
brought that resolution up? I'll vote 
for him' '') 

What many oflhese pelly dicta-
tors didn't say is that, in addition to 
their issues and their projects. they 
also had their inflexible agendas. 
They weren ' t interested in what was 
best for their constituency. Ralher, 
they sought to take control over Iheir 
own silly lillie coves and inlets. In 
their zeal to rise above all others. 
these candidates failed to realize 
that achieving progress outside of 
the old A.S. paradigm often means 
working with others with different 
beliefs, and not always taking full 
credit for the final results. 

The last group of A.S. contend-
ers could only be called "Ihe con-
fused" because many of Ihem hon-
estly didn ' t know why they were 
running. During one interview -
for a senior senator, no less - I 
was convinced that the candidale's 
fraternilY brothers had dared him 
10 run for offi ce. Another candi -
date in the commissioner of aca-
demic affairs race was unsure 
what the "W" drop deadline was. 
Still anolher student, running FOI 
commi ssioner of student advo-
cacy, had never he .J rd of the 
UCS D Academic Senatc or the 
Commitiee fo r Educational Policy 
- groups which the offi ce muSI 
work with on a day-to-day basis. 

Other responses from I hese 
c lu e less candidales in c lud ed: 
"UCSA? What 's UCSA?" and "I 
don ' tlhink that the co-ops are much 

of an issue." Perhaps that most com-
monly uttered phrase was: "I don ' t 
know how 1 would go about paying 
for that." Sadly, these candidates 
weren't even familiar with the flaws 
of the current A.S. paradigm, let 
alone with ways to look beyond it. 
Even worse. many of these candi-
dates are now your newly elected 
A.S. officers and senators. 

Being a good A.S . Council 
member doesn't entail reinventing 
the light bulb or creating a 24-hour 
news network. It instead il1Jplies 
a willingness to search beyond the 
current paradigm for new solu -
tions. The current A.S. Council is 
a bureaucratic structure filled with 
backslabbing, grandstanding and 
arrogant behavior. It consiSIS of 
officers and senators who feel 
their lives have enormous mean-
ing to Ihe vasl majority of UCSD 
students unaffected by their ac-
tion - and always unwilling to 
vote for them.

6 OPINION 

AIDS: Education, 
not research, is 
answer to problerr, 
Continued from Pa&e 4 

Some people point out that the 
disease was being spread long be-
fore the public learned about its dan-
gers and its easy transmission. They 
argue that many AIDS patients con-
tracted the disease before education 
was prevalent. and therefore should 
not be condemned for their igno-
rance. While this is true. our pri mary 
concern should be Lo preventlhose 
people from spreading AIDS, not to 
devote all our resources 10 finding 
11 cure to a problem thaI afflicts so 
few compared to cam.:eror heart dis-
ease. 

According to the American Can-
cer Society, there were 1.252,000 new 
cases of cancer diagnosed in 1995. 
Compare that with the 75,825 new 
AIDS cases reponed by the Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services 
from July 1994 to June 1995. Surely, 
the numbers alone tell us that we 
should seek a cure for cancer before 
AIDS. Consider also that AIDS is al-
most entirely containable, while can-
cer can strike anyone at anytime. 

But more importanlly. we need 
10 look atlhe actions of people with 
these disease~ , Should we spend our 

time and money on people who got 
AIDS through their own actions, or 
on those who were unfortunate 
enough 10 get cancer through no 
fault of their own? The answer is 
obviou . 

Some people still don't know that 
they can contract HIV by sharing a 
drug needle or having unprotected 
sex. Some people do not have access 
to AIDS education or the media. and 
have not learned about these issues, 
Therefore, the process of stopping the 
spread of AIDS must include contin-
ued and enhanced education. so that 
those who actually do not know the 
issues can learn, Once everyone is 
educated. we can accomplish what 
should be our main concern - con-
taining the spread of the disease. 

In fact. statistics for the past three 
years show that the total number of 
AIDS cases is holding steady, and 
even dropping in some demographic 
groups, Education and bener testing 
procedures are clearly working: trans-
fusion accidents have dropped from 
2.6 percent of all cases from 1981 -87 
to just one percent from 1993-95. 
These stati stics prove that current 
methods are working, and that con-
tinued education should render waste-
ful research for cures obsolete. 

Why then has AIDS become 
such a big issue? Perhaps activists 
saw the disease as a chance to vin-

Do you think you know how to: 
e Spell? 

The UCSD Guardian 

dicate their altemative homosexual 
lifestyles, When it was discovered 
that AIDS could be transmilled 
through heterosexual contact, the 
homosexual community was sup-
posedly "off the hook." In other 
words, opponents of homosexuality 
had usedAlDS to damn the lifestyle, 
to show that homosexuals were 
reaping the natural results of their 
"unnatural" activities. 

When it became clear that hetero-
sexual sex could transmit the disease. 
the AIDS movement tooit on a new 
face. AIDS education started focus-
ing primarily on the fact that AIDS 
was not a gay disease, and thal we had 
all better practice safe sex or we'll 
wind up with it. But this new reason-
ing disguised the fact that AIDS is in-
deed primarily a gay disease. 

The statistics support the claims: 
The U.S, Department of Health and 
Human Services reports that over half 
of all AIDS patients contracted HIV 
through homosexual sex. Since 1993. 
52 percent of all new AIDS cases have 
fallen under the "men who have sex 
with men" category. Homosexual sex 
remains the most dangerous activity 
with respect to contracting HlV. Inci-
dence of the disease and biological 
fact affirm this, 

In addition, very few heterosexu-
als have contracted HIV, From July 
I 994 to July I 995,just eleven pen:ent 

of all AIDS patients gotlfiV via het-
erosexua� sex. 

Ironically. the most neglected and 
ignored group has been drug abusers. 
No doubt a product of political pri-
orities, the 25 percent of all ~S 
patients who got HIV through injec-
tion drug use have gone largely un-
noticed. This does not mean that we 
should feel any more sympathy for 
them, or for the eight percent of het-
erosexuals with AIDS. but it shows 
how the AIDS movement has 0b-
scured certain facts about AIDS and 
HIV.

Monday, April i2, 1996 

The bottom line is that AIDS 
should not be the priority that it has 

become~ The disease can be con-
tained and even eliminated with the 
proper amount of education,Be-
yond that, the low number of cases 
and the personal negligence of those 
contracting HIV should force the 
issue far down on the list of diseases 
to attack. Cancer remains a foc far 
more deserving of our anention. as 
well as our time 'and money, The 
abuse and misconception surround-
ing the AIDS issue is more disturb-
ing than the epidemic itself. 

In the period from July 1994 to June 1995, there were a total 
of 75.825 adults with AIDS. In the same period. there were 
1,252,000 cancer cases. Below is a breakdown of the causes 
of the AIDS cases.

Because of projected growth in

Snee and Borsa stated that con-
struction on one parking. structure 
will begin in 1997, and that it should 
be operational as soon as 1998-99. 
A second structure will be built if 
further studies deem it nece sary. 

The draft 's auLhors proposed fi ve 
optimal sites for the two potential 
structures. The structures would be 
built above or below ground, de-
pending on the location: 

• Site A-I , located north of 
Gilman Drive along the east side of 
Myers Drive, would consist of five 
levels - one below ground and four 
above. This ite would provide 800 
additional parking spaces. 

• Site A-2, situated north of 
Gilman Drive along the west side of 
Russell Lane, wouldoffer~ven lev-
els of parking - tW(l belo~and Ii ve

• Site A-3 woald be located on

four levels entirely below ground. 
Site 8 -1 would support 815 new 
spaces. 

• Site B-2, located at the School 
of Medicine and at the end of the 
Library Walk, would have four lev-
els of underground parking and 
would establish 800 more parking 
spots. 

According to the draft, the sites

locations, ~d relocation of existing 
utility lines . 

"At this point, each of the ... op-
tions are all reasonable candidate . 
No two:aand out above the others," 
S~ee a~d Borsa wrote. • 

Ln addition to the two parking struc-
tu~s i.n the Ul)iversity Centers area, 
thedraftcontainsa proposal forathird 
structure in the nonh campus area. 

This structure may become necessary 
if the proposed Sixth College - lo-
cated north of Marshall College -
becomes a reality. 

Although the draft singles out 
north campus, Snee and Borsa noted 
that, "good cases can also be made 
for a structure in the Warren Col-
lege area, Revelle or Muir." 

Unlike the main campus area, 
the east campus area has additional 
unused land thaI can be used for 
surface-lot expansion.'This expan-
sion would be limited to a maxi-
mum of 1,800 spaces. 

While all ' of th. ~e projects nliiy 
seem beneficial to the campus com-
munity, Snee and Borsa admit that 
"convenience comes at a price."

INDY: racing in 
Long Beach 
ContInued from PICe U 
Jimmy Vasser, roar through 
Friday's practice laps with times 
blazing enough to catapult them 
into the top half of the staning 
lineup. 
The Race for Pole Position: 
April 13, 1998 

The green flag for morning 
IndyCar practice begin~ at 9:05 
a. m. At 9:20, the top three drivers 
emerge as Gil de Ferran (52.922 
seconds, 108.160 mph), Alex 
Zanardi (53 .219 sec, 107.556 mph) 
and Scott Pruett (53.274 sec, 
107.445 mph). At 9:40, de Ferran 
beats his old lap record with a 
108.935 mph, as Pruett move into 
second at 107.881 mph. Checkered 
nag at 10:07 a.m. reveals the final 
top three drivers: de Ferran, C. 
Fittipaldi and Zanardi. 

Commenting on the fierce 
qualifying field , six-time Long 
Beach champion AI Unser Jr. said: 
"When I was pole position at Indy 
[five years agol , the third guy 
behind me was a second behind. 
Now, one second behind pole will 
send you back into 19th place." 

Judging from his times in the 
qualifying laps, de Ferran is the 
driver to beat. With an aggressive 
driving style and a crack 
engineering · team, de Ferran's 
yellow Pennzoil number-eight car 

dominates the practice laps and 
appears to run comfortably ahead 
of the other teams. Wags in the 
press room are betting on a large 
margin of victory for de Ferran on 
Sunday. One racing columnist 
makes an observation which, in 
light of Sunday's events, seems 
eerily prophetic: "Unless Gil 
blows a rod or something, he's 
going to run Long Beach 
tomorrow." 
Judgment Day: 
Predictable Starts 

After the "Star Spangled 
Banner" finishes playing over the 
race intercom, the 1996 Toyota 
Grand Prix of Long Beach race 
begins in eamest. 

The UCSD Guardian Monday, April 22, 1996 

It starts with the trademark 
audible "pop" of turbo wastegates 
slamming shut in response to 
dri ver gear-shifting. The smell of 
unburned methanol hangs in the air 
as thirsty IndyCar engines guzzle 
and drain 40-gallon fuel cells at a 
ferocious clip of less than two 
miles per galion. 

Roarl", Into action: Paul Tracy, who has won over $4 million in IndyCar prize money to date, zooms around 
the track at Long Beach at speeds In excess of 100 mph. He won the race in 1993. 

With over a 100-pound 
difference between a full tank and 
an empty one, dri vers constantly 
adjust their driving to reflect the 
dynamic shift in their vehicle's 
center of gravity. Decreasing fuel 
weight changes cornering, 
accelerating and handling 
characteristics. 

The fuel itself is hardly cheap 
- race-grade methanol runs over 
$13 per gallon. Top teams bum 

over $200,000 of fuel a year to 
train their drivers to maximize the 
performance envelopes of their 
cars in all of the stages of fuel 
depletion. 

Order at Lap One: de Ferran, 
Zanardi , Tracy, Jimmy Vasser, 
Pruett, Parker Johnstone, Robby 
Gordon, Greg Moore, AI Unser, Jr. 
and Christian Filtipaldi. 

As expected, de Ferran pulls 
ahead early in the race, forcing 
other dri vers to fight for second

the day occurs, as Andre Ribero 
makes contact with a wall at tum 
one, and the car (in indyspeak) is 
"retired." 

After 20 laps, de Ferran's 
dominant lead stretches to a' 
comfortable 2.0S-second edge over 
Zanardi - an eternity considering 
the 50-second length of the lap. 
Hot in pursuit are Vasser, Scott

makes the first SLOp. De Ferran 
follows suit one lap later, 
relinquishing his coveted lead 
position to Zanardi. Zanardi's day 
in the sun is short-lived, as he 
makes contact with Bobby Rahal's 
car, triggering a full-course yellow 
flag. De Ferran soon regains the 
lead. 
Unsportsmanlike Conduct 

Lap 48: Between turns six and 
seven . Moore collids with 
Christian Fitlipaldi, triggering the 
second full-course yellow flag . 
Angered by the accident. 
Fitlipaldi walks over to Moore's 

vehicle afler both cars had spun 
oul. He allempts to jerk Moore 
out of his cockpit by the helmet. 
Although Fillipaldi is fined 
$5,000 for "unsportsmanlike 
conduct," fan reaction indicates 
that they believe the fine alone is 
insufficient. 
Untouchable Leader 

Lap 80: At this point, de Ferran 
sits on a seven-second lead over 
second-place Vasser. And AI Unser, 
Jr., "Emperor of Long Beach," 
languishes in founh. Johnstone, 
without a point to his name, is 
gamely pursuing Vasser's car in the 
third-place slot. 
Heartbreak 

Lap 101: With only four laps of 
lhe lOS-lap race to go, de Ferran's 
car slows down inexplicably, 

The UCSD Guardian 

eradicating his hard work on the 
past 100 laps. 

As he told reporters in a POSI-
race interview: "It was a shame. It 
was a small problem wilh the 
engine. They tell me the turbo hose 
came loose. I lost the turbocharger. 
I had no indication ahead of time. It 
was a sudden problem." 

Losing the turbocharger is the 
break that Jimmy Vasser needs, and 
he seizes the lead to finish with his 
third victory in four PPG races on 
the 1996 season. Johnstone and AI 
Unser, Jr. follow in second and 
third, respectively. 

"It wasn't lost on me on the 
closing laps that I had the 
'Emperor of the Beach' behind 
me, and a Honda [Vasser) in front 
of me that I wasn ' t going to 

catch," Johnstone said. .. 
Finishing second is a victory here 
for us. In fact , to finish in front of 
Unser, Jr. at Long Beach, well, if 
I never do anything else in 
racing .... " 

Vasser was ecstatic with the 
win, but at the same time expressed 
sypathy for the less fortunat.e 
racers. 

"I feel bad for my teammate, 
Alex [ZanardiJ, who drove a great 
rac.e ... and obviously for de Ferran." 
Vasser said. 'They say sometimes 
you'd rather be lucky than good, 
and today, it seemed like we were 
lucky. 

"We knew we couldn't catch 
Gil [de Ferran] unless he had a 
problem. The championship was 
obviously a goal of ours at the start 

FEATURES 13 

of the season, but you've got to 
take it one race at a lime. This is a 
great moment for Target Chip 
Ganassi Racing," he added. 

For Indy fans, races like the 
1996 Toyota Grand Prix are the 
reason we love the sport. From the 
heartbreaking last-minute reversal 
of fonune of de Ferran, to the 
unexpected heroics of small-town 
racers like Parker Johnstone in 
eclipsing legends like AI Unser, 
Jr., the Long Beach race 
underscores the importance of 
chance in auto racing. 

In a [ndyCar world dominated 
by big money and hot, talent, 
sometimes a touch of luck can 
make all the difference between 
winning and ju t missing that 
checkered flag.

I. NEWS The UCSD Guardiu Mond8y, April h 1996 
Judge Gives OK to Suit Against Governor and UC Regents 
ILLEGAL: ACLU 
alleges Wilson violated 
Open Meetings Act 

Sttlff Writer 
In a move which could threaten 10 

invalidate the UC Board of Regents' 
July 20 decision to end affirmative 
action, a San FranciscoSuperiorCourt 
judge last Monday allowed the Ameri-
CUI Civil Liberties Union (A~LU) 10 
pursue il~ lawsuit against Gov. Pete 
Wilson and the regents. 

1be suit, filed in late February on 
behalf of UC Santa Barbara's student 
paper,The Daily Nexus , and.the 
newspaper's Campus Editor. Tim 
Molloy, claims that Wilson oontacted 
members of the board via telephone 
and alsoconductcd''back-room'' deal-
ings prior to their July 20 meeting 
which ended affirmative action. 

Because this alleged action would

The Timej rqKlItcd that if an ap-
peal is unsuccessful, ACLU lawyers 
will probably depose some of the re-
gents to asce.rtain if they were con-
tacted by Wilson before the affirrna-
ti ve-action vote. Prosecution lawyers 
believe that if they can find at least 
eight regents who had spoken to Wil-
son prior to the vote, their suit wi II be 
successful. 

AccordingtoBlair, two regents-
Ward Connerly and Roy Brophy -
have publicly acknowledged 'speak-
ing to Gov. Wilson before the affir-
mative-action vote. 

Molloy, who lllempted to obtain 
Wilson's phone reconIs on more than 
25 occasions, said he beUeves a total 
of 10 regents spoke 10 Wilson before 
the affinnative-action meeting. 

"If you line upadecision on public 
policy outside of the public eye, you 
are denying the public the opportu-
nity, to sec what kind of input went 
into the decision," Molloy said. 

He added that a.llhough some re-
gents spoke to the governor, none 
have since acknowledged that they 
"lined up lIOIes" based on those con-
versations. 

Blair said that while Wilson's 
phone records - which the governor 
refuses to release based on "proper 
assertion of privilege" - would re-
veal whom he called, they would not 
indicate the contelll of those calls. 

"What you need to show to prove 
a violation of Bagley-Keene is that all 
these guys got together and made a 
promise to vote , certain way, and ' 
simply disclosing the fact that the 
phone numbers were dialed while 
putting aside whodiaJed them doesn't 
[prove anything] whatsoever," Blair 
said 

Molloy said that if the prosecution 
wins the suil, the n:aents could recon-
vene and pass the SP-I and ~P-2 
legislation again.

Senior left-handed hurler Mike 
Bryant was on the hill in the first 
game of Saturday's double dip, and 
ran into bad luck. He gave up eight 
runs in three and two-thirds of an 
inning, but only two of those were 
earned, as the Triton defense com-
mitted three errors behind Bryant. 
UCSD fell behind, 8-4, in the fourth 
inning of the scheduled seven-in-
ning game and could not mount a 
comeback, eventually falling, 10-4. 

Abrams ran into some trouble in 
the ninth. but DeGrasse was clutch, 
hammering the nail in Chapman' s 
coffin for his second save of the 
weekend.

The Tritons counted on a reliable 
source to pull out the nightcap, as 
senior slugger Craig Birk cranked 

"Since the second half, we 've 
been playing great baseball ." 
Bryant said. "The chemistry is 
there now and the hilling has been 
great. If a couple of breaks go our 
way , it's a different season. We 
underachieved early on. but now 
it's com ing together. We've beaten 
some top teams lately and we jusl 
ruined Chapman's fihance of get-

Pitzer Invite Tests Tritons 
INVITATIONAL: Final push toward state meet begins for Tritons at Pomona 
By D .. KnIft 
Sports Editor 

When you're aI the top of the Di· 
vision ill heap, there is lillie competi-
tion to be found among the other 

teams in the division. 
So the Tritons have 
followedaschedule.of 
invi1ational meets 
which has matched 
them against Division 
I and J] athletes, in ad-
dition to their rivals 
from the NCAA 's 

lcast-heraldeddivision. UCSD'srnost 
recent challenge was Friday's 
Pomona-PilZer Inviwional. 

The sprinting evenls were among 
the bright spots for UCSD, as the 
return of 100-meter Rlan Juan 
Magdaroag from a hamslring injury 
aided the Triton's effort. Magdaroag 
finished in 11.49, and according to 
Coach'Ted Van ArsdaJe, "[heJlooks 
like he's ready to get rolling again." 

In the women's 100, Joyce Lee 
won her heat with a personal record 
(p.r.)of 12.71, while Kathy Li notched 
a solid time of 12.95. Li then doubled 
her pleasure by running in the 200 and 
finishing in 26.72, only nine-one-hun-
dredths of a second off of a p.r. 

At the 400, UCSD's men were led 
by Jose Arciniega, who earned a p.r. 
with a time of 50.59, taking second in 
his heal. The women were parp.d by 
Robyn Herskowi tz, whoset" '.nlcICC

Dave Constantine and Scott

Walton's 3:~.92 was a provisional 
NCAA qualifying time, and learn·

Lindsey, however, the race was actu-
ally a bit fru_slrating, as he had been 
hoping to 6ieak the 3:52 barrier. 

"II was my fourth time in thai 
range, and I've been wailing for a 
drop," Lindsey said. 

The race s.tarted roughly, as the 
plethora of runners bunched aI the 
start resulted in an early race stumble 
for Lindsey. The Triton middle-dis-
ranee specialisl found himself quickly 
in last, where he stayed until lap three.

Triton Novice Men Triumph 
a,D .. KNft 
Spotts Editor 

For the UCSD' crew team. this 
season. the on-the-water highlights 
have been produced, for the most 
part, by the women's squad. 
Led by a lightweight crew 
which re-eslablished ils su-
periorily aI the recent State 
Championships (April 13-
14), the Triton women have 
been leaving their marie 

This last weekend, how-
ever, opponents from SDSU 
and USD had no lightweight con. 
tenders to sacrifice to the Triton 
goddesses, forcing UCSD to look 
elsewhere for inspiralional races. 

As iltumed out. it was the men 
who stepped forward with strong 
showings, as both Triton men's boats 
grabbed firsl place in the city cham· 
pionships al Mission Beach. 

Although the UCSDmen's team 
did not have a varsity boat to pit 
against its cross-town rivals, the 
Tritons did field a pair of novice 
boats: one eight-man and one four-
man. The eight-man boat was the 
first to hit the water, and the UCSD 
crew lived up to its favored starus by 
winning in convincing fashion. 

The four-man crew was actually 
an afterthought which the Tritons 
decided to field at the "last minute," 
according to men's coach John 
Wang. The four-man crew, which 
consisted of the stem four from the 
eight-man team, again dominated 
lhe field to earn city bragging rights. 

crew was forced to settle for third, as 
the Tritons SCrayed from their ele-
ment in the liprweight category to 
row with the big girls. 

"State and USD were just too 
strong over the first I,(XX) 
[meters) for us to take ad-
vantageof what would have 
been the best part of our 
race,"UCSDwomen'sHead 
Coach Jack V a1lerga said. 

In the varsily·four race, 
lhe Tritons were relegated 
10 third among fO,ur boalS, 

whi Ie the novice eight-woman crew 
fared a bit better, snatching second, 
a mere Iwo seconds in back of their 
Aztec rivals. 

The defeat in the women's var-
sity four "'as an improvement, how-
ever, as SDSU had beaten lhis same 
UCSD crew by five seconds just a 
week ago. Saturday's race was all 
State in the early going, as the Aztec 
boat accelerated to an early lead in 
the choppy Walers of west Mission 
Bay. TIle fine. weather had brought a 
number of powerboats within reach 
of the course, and all the crews had 
10 struggle with the extra turbulence. 
After falling behind early, the Tri· 
tons made a charge bul simply 
cou Idn 't muster enough to close the 
final half length on SDSU as the 
2,()()(}.meter race concluded. 

For lhe women, lhe day was 
I marked by defeat. The varsity-eight 

"We would have preferred to 
beat them, and we thoughl we had a 
good chance," Vallerga said. "But 
I'm not discouraged. We're getting 
faster, and I think we'll be able to 
catch them by the [pacific Coast 
Rowing Championships]." 

I 
I EASY: Triton 

men roIl over USIU 
number-five David Murphy and 
number-sill Melicharek each made 
a fine showing in their respective 
positions. 

Continued from Pac. 20 
Mihet was unable to come from 

behind and win his march aI number 
, three. but the lower half of the line-
up fared well against the struggling 
usru squad. 

Ping Yeh nearly shut out his 
opponent in the fourth position, and 

'This match was a good [one for 
me]," Yeh said. "I just found [my 
opponent's] weakness andexploited 
it." 

This win brings the Triton record 
to 7-8 and sets the stage for Tuesday , s 
match at Point Loma Nazarene at 2 
p.m.

With the NFL draft held in 
New York last weekend. it 
seemed like the appropriate 

Aztecs Slip Past Fiery Tritons 
- . time for an insightful story on 

what really goe on behind 
the scenes. as 30 teams from 
around the country gather in 
the Big Apple for a horse 
auction - bidding for 
athletes who have allowed 
themselves to be mea ured, 
tested and interviewed in 
hopes of being picked early 
enough to merit a fat signing 
bonus. 

The ordinary fan tum on 
the television and sees a 
wealthy old man (NFL 
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue) 
call out the names of 250-lbs 
athletes who will eventually 
compele on the gridiron. But I 
have the lowdown on what 
really goes on in the team "war 
rooms," and what kind of 
strategy goes into drafting a 
future NFL player. 

CLOSE:UCSD 
couldn't upset SDSU at 
home on Friday night 
By Chris Lee 
Staff Wnter 

There is nothing like a humiliating 
defeat to fire a team up in anticipation 
of a rematch. as the UCSD women's 

water polo team dis-
covered this weekend 
after an embarrassing 
loss at the hands of a 
powerful SDSU squad 
last month. 

Looking for re-
demption last Friday 
against the Aztecs at 

Canyonview pool, pride took center 
stage for every Triton, allowing the 
team to play its best polo of the year 
before eventually falling to SDSU, 7;

Friday 's match between these two

their first meeting, as that contest was 
over practically before it began. This 
time around, however, lhe Tritons 
hung close through three 'quarters, 
with the score tied at three. Unfortu-

motivation or an increased sense of 
urgency from the Aztecs. the fourth 
quarter for the Tritons proved to be 
their downfall, as they wereoutscored 
to end the contest, 4-2. 

Adding insult to injury, the last 
two goals by the Aztecs came in the 
final minute and a half of the game. as 

State stormed through the Triton de-
fense to earn the hard-fought victory. 

"We had some mental breakdowns 
in the last quarter on the defensive 
side," Triton Head Coach Denny 
Harper said after the game. "But I'm 
generally pleased with the team's per-
formance and the significant improve-
ment we made in the last couple of 
weeks." 

Jennifer Payne led the Triton at-

picked up the slack, pitching five

giving up only two runs in Friday's 
lone contest - a 6-4 decision for 
the La Jollans. UCSD lost the first 

game of Saturday's double-

to tally five runs en route to a 
5-3 win in the nightcap. Andy

Bobby Arban and Chuck 
Johnson provided the offensive 
power for UCSD. Arban went 3-4 
with an RBI, two doubles, and a run 
scored in Friday's game. Johnson 
was equal to the task, tallying three 
hits on Friday and two hils with

Kelly Gilbreth added one for UCSD. 
"I felt really good before the game. 

We felt a lot of motivation," Payne 
said. "Unfortunately, most of it went 
down at the end of the third [period)." 

Though this game counts as a loss 
in the record books, the team could 
not be blamed for lack of desire. End-
ing the regular season on a mixed 
note, the team looks to the postseason 
and the coming qualifications. 

"We have a really good chance 

this year, and all we have to do is 
become more consistent as a team," 
said junior Shawna Caballero, whose 
vital contributions to the team rarely 
show up in the stat sheet "We just 
have to play well during all of our 
games and then finish it." 

"What this game showed was our 
weaknesses, and [they] could only 
help us get stronger," Harper said. 
"We' ll be welT prepared for whatever 
we have to face in the playoffs."
