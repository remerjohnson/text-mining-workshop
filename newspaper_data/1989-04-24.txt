Elections 
Called A 
'Real Mess' 
By CATHERINE DILLE 

Staff Writer and 
DAVID WYNER 

Associate News Editor 

This year's A.S. elections were 
plagued by a number of problems 
due in part to the A.S. election 
bylaws and the A.S. Constitu-
tion, according to source involved 
with the elections. 

Elections officials blame much 
of the confusion over this year's 
elections on two main problems: 
the duration of the campaign 
period and the lack of specific 
spending regulations for slates. 

A.S. President Maynard 
Dimmesdale said that "The by-
laws are at fault and [so is the] 
A.S. Constitution ... Overall, it's 
a real mess." 

The campaign time limit placed 
on candidates as a result of the 
Constitution is unnecessarily 
short, Dimmesdale added. 

He explained that "the Consti-
tution states that the elections 
must be held in the econd week 
of the quarter and that runoffs 
must be held in the third week." 

This constitutional stipulation 
is not universal among all the UC 
campuse. 

This Is the first of a two-part 
examination of the A.S. election 
procaa •. Part two will appear on 
April 27. 

UCSB allows candidates three 
weeks to conduct their campaigns, 
and, while UC Berkeley does not 
have a specific campaign time 
limit, there is a tacit agreement 
among candidates to limit the 
campaign length to two or three 
week , according to sources in 
both schools' A.S. offices. 

ASUCSD Elections Manager 
Julie Ramirez sees the brief cam-
paign period here as a problem 
and thinks that UCSB's and Ber-
keley's campaign lengths are more 
appropriate. 

"If everything was longer we 
would have a better [voter] turn-
out," she said, noting that, "Stu-
dents don't have a chance to be 
informed. 

Ramirez is presently attempt-
ing to initiate legislation that 
would increase UCSD'scampaign 
length to two and a half weeks 
and add one additional week to 
the filing period . 

These changes, she pointed out, 
can onl be brought about by 
amending the A. . Constitution; 
something that can only be done 
by either submitting the amend-
ments to a vote of the student 
body, or by holding a constitu-
tional convention. 

Ramirez al 0 said that she was 
appointed as elections manager at 
the first A.S. meeting of the win-
ter quarter, an appointment that 
left her little time to prepare for 
the upcoming elections. 

") had two or three weeks to 
make out a calendar, to make out 
a budget ... to do everything. I 
barely had time to publicize [this 
election]," she said .

While the A.S. Constitution 
ha been blamed for the short 
campaign duration, there is no 
mention in the Constitution of 
campaign spending limitations for 
the election candidate and lates; 
another aspect of the recent elec-
tions which many have found 
problematic.

Protesters Arrested 
At Price Center 

By PORSCHE SHANTZ 
Staff Writer 

Amid chants of "Bring Back 
the Pub"and "Student rights / stu-
dent co-ops," four out of approx-
imately 30 students were arrested 
while protesting the opening of 
the Price Center at noon on 
Friday. 

During Friday's ribbon cutting 
ceremony, a group of protesters 
marched on the Price Center as 
part of what protestor Arnie 
Schoenberg called "a continuing 
struggle to force the administra-
tion to re pect student rights ." 

According to a flyer that the 
protestor distributed during the 
event, their main reason for dem-
onstrating was the lack of student 
input on the board involved in the 
planning of the Center. 
. "In 1983, the administration 

presented the student with a ques-
tionnaire asking them what they 
would like in 'their' new student 
center, not if ... we, the students, 
even wanted a new tudent center 
or were willing to pay for it," aid 
Peter Bogdanovic, one of the pro-
test's organizers. 

"Now," he continued, "they got 
us shelling out $38 a quarter for 
the privilege of hopping at this 
atrocious mall that they have the 
gall to name the Price Center, not 
the Student Center ... even in its 
name, they've got you reaching 
for your wallet!" 

While some demonstrators were 
'holding signs reading "They killed 
our Pub, don't eat their Grub" 
and "Put Jimbo & Tucker in the 

Time Capsule" others, including 
Schoenberg, addre sed the crowd 
through a power megaphone. 

A police/ protester clash ensued 
over the use of the megaphone 
and resulted in what eyewitnes es 
descri bed a wrongful and escal-
ating police action. 

Campus police officer Dave 
Rose notified protesters that the 
oil funnel marcher were u ing for 
ound amplification was permis-

sa ble, but were warned that the 
use of the megaphone would be 
considered disturbing the peace. 

") jumped into the fo untain 
near Arnie [Schoenberg] and told 
him to give me the megaphone," 
Rose recounted after the incident. 

"He ran north across the gras!!. 
) began to run after him, but [pro-
tester Jeffrey] Kile ran betweeen us 
and blocked my path. Arnie con-
tinued acro s the grass towards 
other officer, so I returned to the 
west tair ," Rose aid . 

Officers pur ued choenberg 
when he began running around 
the Price Center, megaphone in 
hand , while other students attemp-
ted to keep police from getting 
through the crowd while pur uing 
him. 

According to Ro e, Schoenberg 
returned to the stairs after run-
ning fro m police and pa sed the 
megaphone to another student. 

"The megaphone continued to 
be handed from person to person 
up the stair until it was handed to 
Gethrin Noble who was tanding 
in front of me," Rose aid , des-
cribing the events that led to 
Noble's arrest.

Student Advocate Bard-Alan 

Finlan described the election 
period as "totally inadequate." 

"The principle problem is the 
absurd filing date in relation to 
voting time," Finlan said. "No 
one can make a good choice 
without more time ... 

Ribbon Cutting Ceremony Proceeds 
Despite Protesters' Signs and Shouts 

Alina Zirino, a candidate for 
the position of academic affair 
commissioner who withdrew from 
the race last week, disagrees with 
Finlan. 

Zirino said the campaign length 
is already too long for candidate 
to pay adequate attention to their 
grade while conducting a cam-
paign. 

"If you want to win you cannot 
attend classe . That's what it take 
to win. The people that we have 
now are one-third college student 
and two-thirds politician," she 
said . 

Zirino went on to say that 
many candidate' G PAs suffer 
from the long hour he felt they 
mu t put into campaign prepara-
tion and campaigning if they are 
to win their races. 

"Keep [the campaign] short, so 
we can pas our cia e," he 
recommended .

Law Students at UC Berkeley Arrested 
Protesting Low Faculty Ethnic Diversity 
. BERKELEY - FOI1y-six UC Berkeley students 
were arrested after an eight-hour sit-in at Boalt Hall 
law school April 6, the culmination of a strike by an 
overwhelming number of law students throughout the 
nation. 

The Boalt strike was paI1 of a nationwide move-
ment at approximately 35 law chools held by stu-
dents to protest the lack of faculty diversity in their 
schools. Eighty-seven percent of Boalt students did 
not attend cia es in SUppOI1 of the strike, according 
to one Boalt student and strike organizer. 

Six of the students arrested were charged with tres-
passing in law school Dean Jesse Choper's office at 
about 5 p.m., and released five hours later, according 
to an assistant U C police chief. 

One of the six was also charged with interfering 
with an officer, while the other 40 were charged with 
trespassing in Boalt Hall after the six were released. 

During the protest , Boalt students demanded that 
Choper endorse the strikers' request that the next five 
faculty members hired for the school be minorities and 
include one Asian-American, one Native American 
and one minority woman . 

Choper refused to endorse the demand , saying, "I 
question the legality of reserving five places."

UC Riverside Committee Considering 
Doubling Parking Fee~ Next Year 

RIVERSIDE - The UC Riverside Parking Com-
mittee is considering a parking fee increase for next 
year. 

"What's being talked about is a 100 percent 
increase," said Virginia Field, management services 
officer for parking operations. Field believes an 
increase is needed to pay for new parking facilities. 

A 100 percent fee increase would raise student 
parking fees from $15 per quarter to 530 per quarter. 
Faculty Fees would increase from 524 per quarter to 
$48.

decision to ban all styrofoam products in the UCSB 
University Center, the building governance board

voted Monday to allow cu tomers to choo e between 
paper and styrofoam containers for beverages. 

Due to the unexpected rise in paper costs , the board 
felt compelled to consider ways to avoid the projected 
Center deficit of $43.000. 

After month of debate on the pros and cons of 
paper and styrofoam J1foducts , the governance board 
passed tt." new policy, which will "immediately" allow 
customer to choose for themselves which type of 
product they want to use.

Grad Student Employee Association 
Members Authorize Strike at VCB 

BERKELEY - In a show of overwhelming unity 
on April 5, 99 percent of UC Berkeley graduate stu-
dent employee association members authorized a 
campuswide strike. 

The association, which represents 1,500 of the Uni-
versity'S 2,500 teaching assistants, research assistants, 
tutors , and readers suppoI1ed the strike, which will 
come six months after UC Berkeley refused to recog-
nize the association. 

A strike by most AGSE members may seriously 
hamper normal classroom proceedings, as 60 percent 
of undergraduate courses are taught by graduate stu-
dents, and 60 percent of graduate student employees 
are members of the association . 

The strike is being financially supported by the Uni-
ted Auto Workers and its 5800 million strike fund. 
According to UA W International Representative 
Mary Ann Massenburg, each striking member will 
receive 5100 a week, and the union will offer con-
tinued health insurance to any member with a plan.

Anderson, dressed in plain clothes, 
came up behind a student and 
reached into a student's pocket to 
confiscate a pen that had been 
used to pop balloons.

Bylaws Are Inadequate 
The AS UCSD election bylaws need work . A lot of work . The 

current Council is aware of this , and is beginning to look at the 
problems - but it is unlikely it will be able to work them out 
before the new Council takes office. Next year's Council will 
face a complex task. 

First, the campaign is too short. This results in ill-informed 
voters, and a low turnout. A longer campaign would allow 
candidate to run less hectic ca mpaigns (perhap working in a 
few classes), and would allow a closer examination of the candi-
dates. Other universities have much longer campaigns, and find 
them beneficial. 

Next, the problem of slates needs to be addressed . Abuses 
such as those by two candidates in the recent electio n , a nd by 
many in the pa t, are too easy. Allowing one candidate to s pend 
~ubstantially mor~ than his or h9'-opponent is troubling, even if 
It encourages alliances among candidates. Moreover, these 
alliances result in rougher, more divisive campaigns because 
late members tend to gang up on their opponents. This carries 

over into the A.S. the next ear, since entire slates are rarely 
elected . Thus, late don't provide for a more clo ely knit A.S. -
the o pposite is true. 

After each election, there is always a lew of viola tion filings . 
Candidates accuse each other of all sorts of technical violations.

Center was in protest of the Center itself specifically ItS 
commercial corporate orientation. By allowing (ordering?) 
ca mpus police to forcefull\ arrest four stude nt demonstrators 
and haras~ others. the admi'nistration denied these students their 
right to voice their opinions in a facility largely constructed with 
student fees . 

Most transfer students ""Ill attest to the fact that UCSD was 
orely lacking a good student center. The problem is, in many 

ways It still is . The Center isn't student-oriented, and the admin-
istration takes upa lot of the office space. Don't expect any price 
reductions when the bookstore moves to its new location, either 

It will still be one of the most ex pensive in the UC system, 
certainly much higher than the student-operated bookstores 
which many universities have. For the Price Cente r to realize its 
potential, students will have to feel that it is there to se rve their 
need s, and not to just be an administration showcase. 

T his will require effort on the part of both the administration 
and st udents . The administration can't just be complacent, and 
hope that the oppositio n is a small minority which will just fade 
away. And students can't just wave signs and insist that they 
won't u se the Center. There's a real danger here that the Price 
Center and th e old Student Center will become nuclei of separ-
ate student cliques; more divisiveness is not what we need . 

These two centers should complement each the old Center 
serving as a place for tudent co-ops, enterprises and media , and 
the Price Center servi ng as a place for the A.S., student organi-
zatiom, Assorted Vinyl, a nd yes, Wendy's and other restaurants 
which students would otherwise just go off campu to patronile . 
The ad ministration must work hard to avoid the perception that 
they are unrespomlve to student need ~ and wants , and the two 
centers are the pe rfect starting places. ' I oleration of free speech in 
the Center, making more space available to SLudenb and less to 
the administration, and work ing to at least partially implement

Election 
Comments 
Editor: 

I would like to express my most 
sincere appreciation to all those 
who supponed me - both in 
their efforts and their votes - and 
to all those who stood by me 
through thick and thin. 

First and foremost, I would 
like to recognize my runningmates 
(Alex Wong and Lisa Collins) 
who made th i tough campaign 
enjoyable and succes ful. I would 
like to acknowledge all those who 
gave me encourgement during the 
election period . I would also like 
to thank all the organizations that 
supported me and those individ-
uals who spoke on my behalf. 
And finally, I would like to thank 
all those who upponed me and 
voted during the general and run-
off elections. 

The election process can be a 
grueling one, involving a number 
of different personalities that may 
oppose each other in the political 
arena. I would like to congratu-
late all my opponents for running 
good campaigns and attempting 
to keep it free from the "mudsling-
II1g" that was often evident in 
prior elections. John Robison and 
ROj Hobbs should be com-
mended for Iheir outstanding

Now that the elections are over 
it's crucial that we come togethe; 
to start creating the future of our 
campus. We need to address the 
night-time parking issue, the stu-
dent fees issue, and to start reach-
ing out to the community. I re-
main committed to student rights 
and to serving you, but I need 
your help and support . Together 
we can make a difference and take

Is Thrilling?

Gee, the opening of the Price

The Administration has once 
again demonstrated its efficiency

Atkinson Gets Failing Grade 
Editor: 

I n response to Provost Led-
den' it:lter(Guardian , April 20), I 
submit : 

1. It is not the place for the 
administration (i .e. Ledden) to 
judge itself. If the undergraduates 
wish to eval uate how the chancel-
lor has affected them, it is for 
them to decide - both in the par-
ticular forum, and in the the 
determination of the verdict. The 
undergraduates are constantly 
being evaluated by the adminis-
tration (includi ng the faculty in 
Ihis category) - the grading pro-
cess being designed to help im-
prove them as st udents. Why. 
Ihen, ca n't the administration take 
thi~ as a re port card on their per-
formance from the undergradu-
ate' per pecthe. and simply try 

to improve themselves as an 
administration? 

2. It cenainly is not approp-
riate for the administration (i.e . 
Ledden) to claim the vote is not a 
genuine reflection of the under-
graduate student body's regard 
for the chancellor. The only "pre-
dictable" element to this vote is 
that the administration would 
disregard it. 

3. Once past these above con-
cerns, Ledden has tried to argue 
that relations between the A.S. 
and the chancellor have, in the 
past , been "effective," and so we 
should (or at least the "eight prior 
presidents") be "astonishcd and 
dismayed ... [at this] turn of 
events ." Times may have been 
bener for those group, of under-

Commentary 
Arrestee Speaks Out 
By JEFFREY KILE 
Thought J might comment on the little interrup-

tion of Friday's gala festivities at the Price Center. 
You should know by now that the protest began, in 
part, because UCSD administrative autocrats con-
ceived of and acted on plans to fund the Center over 
the blatant objections of 90 percent of the students 
inspecting the proposal. 

A veritable plethora of environmental and civil / 
student rights rationales in support of protesting the 
existence of the new student center is flanked by the 
fact that the referendum for new student fees to be 
allocated toward the place was conducted illegally in 
the first place. 

The fact that our First Amendment rights were 
tapdanced on that afternoon didn't help any either. 

Regardless, when we made our way down to the 
edge of the Center we were greeted by a number of 
peace officers and a gentleman in a grey three-piece 
suit wearing a bow tie who took it upon himself to 
push, shove, and subsequently flog one protester 
over a drum he was carrying. 

About a half hour later, an officer accompanied 
by this same gent in the grey suit slammed me in the 
back, pushing me off a wall about five feet high . 
After 1 scraped myself off the ground I saw the grey 
suit guy walking off with a megaphone belonging to

a protester. 1 figured he was just one of Tucker's 
croneys or a Price benefactor, either way some 
belligerant redneck out to rid the planet of pinko 
commies like me, 

I ran after him and lunged for the megaphone. 
The man turned around - winding his arm up over 
his head - about to clock me. I should probably 
mention that I stand about 5'8 ff , weigh in at a hulk-
ing 135 pounds, and had no object with which to 
threaten him. He's about 6'6w, has got to weigh at 
least 240 and was about to knock me cold with the 
megaphone when I and another protester screamed 
something to the effect of "Don't do it man, 111 have 
you arrested so fast itll make your head spin." He 
grunted "What?" I said "Look around, there's 20 
people watching you." The man in grey looked 
around, lowered his arm, turned and walked off. A 
couple of bystanders, astonished, offered to testify 

again~t the kook if I needed them to. 
In an adrenaline frenzy I went after the thing a 

second time. I stress that in neither instance did I 
contact the man's body. With that, the man in the 
grey suit spun around, grabbed me by the arm and 
shared with me "You're under arrest for assaulting a 
police officer. I'm the chief of police." 

I thought it interesting that he son of neglected to 
mention that beforehand. 

He threw me to another officer who put handcuffs 
on me and stuffed me into the back of the squad car 
with another guy. We were asked a couple of ques-
tions and taken to the cam pus station for booking. 
After only about 3S minutes a fellow officer reminded

present group of undergraduates 
can neither experience nor base 
their present evaluation upon. 
History is irrelevant for this vote: 
this group of undergraduates, via . 
their experiences, voted their con-
science. Beyond thi , I ubmit 
that past A.S. administrations 
have been silent, for whateve r 
reason. We must remember that it 
has been only recently that the 
A.S. has been able to even slightly 
brea k Greek domination, that this 
may account for a more active

ACCELERATED PROFESSIONAL 
DEVELOPMENT 

4. Ledden also attempts to dis-
credit the vote by citing some of 
the chancellor's strong points: "in 
creased ... number of scholar-
ships, recreational facilities and 
housing, and ' " recruitment of 
many outstanding faculty. "These 
may be fantastic accomplish-
ments, but how are the students 
supposed to be aware offacts not 
made widely known to them? 

It is clear from the referendum 
that the chancellor has not given 
the undergraduates a reason to 
vote for him. It is the chancellor'S 
responsibility to educate the stu-
dent body in regard to his job 
performance. An excellent way to 
do this would be a quarterly, well-
publicized "State of the Campus" 
speech. 

On the other hand, we might be 
forced to interpret the vote as a 
sign that the undergraduates don't 
place much importance on Led-
den's list of accomplishments. Is 
there more to being a chancellor 
than just building and recruiting? 
I would hope so. The word 
"leader" comes to mind. 

5. In particular, Ledden misses 
the point of the referendum. It 
was not about particular disputes, 
issues or the like; it was a general 
evaluation of the chancellor with 
respect to the undergraduates, and 
even further, a general evaluation 
of the administration as a whole. 
This is analogous to having to 
grade a student in a course: some 
exams look good; homework, 
labs, final exam are poor. The 
instructor must average these 
together to obtain a single grade 
for the tudent . The undergradu-
ates have spoken, and from their 
viewpoint, Atkinson , Richard c., 
gets an F.

Life 
C.ontinued from pale 4 
just walking around campus. You can even enter-
tain yourself during the week by looking at some 
of the people running for certain positions. This 
year there was a guy wearing one of those road 
construction worker's jackets distributing flyers 
to any passers-by. He was fun to look at. A.S. 
election week is great. 

One thing I really appreciate is the prevailing 
negative student body reaction toward the Price 
Center. It's splendid how the students have really 
come together to examine one aspect- the mov-
ing of the Pub- to determine whether or not the 
Price Center meets their standards. I've always 
had a similar motto: If there's a problem, tear it 
down and build it all over again. Let's do it. 1 love 
the student reaction. 

T-Reg i easy, and fun . I will guide you 
through the process. If you makea mistake, don't 
worry, because you probably can't get into the 
class anyway. To be honest, this is one of the best 
things that couJd happen to a student. Just 
imagine. Once you find out every class you want 
to take is full, you begin to think twice about your 
major and why you're trying to take those classes 

OPINION 

anyway. T-Reg allows you to broaden your 
horizons, and you may come to the realization 
that you want to change your lTlajor altogether 
T-Reg is simply stupendous. 

I love the parking enforcement. It gives me a 
spine-tingling sensation just dreaming about see-
ing a parking attendant driving around in one of 
those cool trucks. I find it marvelous how they're 
always in your way when you try to make your 
way out of the parking lot, and how they're real 
understanding and lenient when a parking permit 
is slightly tilted on somebody's dashboard . The 
allendants are first-rate sensational people. I love 
them. 

I really love campus construction. I consider it 
a Godsend every time I have to drive 45 miles out 
of my way becuase the tiny little road that goes by 
the upper Third apartments is filled with 76 
cranes and 365 forklifts. It gives me a chance to 
see more of the campus. I'm not really sure if I 
would've ever seen the Institute ofthe Americas if 
it wasn't for construction. I love thinking about 
how fortunate my great grandchildren will be 
when they get to come to this campus when it's 
finished . Construction is wonderfuL 

In fact, everything is wonderful. Just wonder-
ful.

our cop to read us our Mirandas 
- which he had sort of managed 
to overlook. Minor error. 

After a two-hour booking pro-
cess I mentioned to the 35-
minute-Miranda man that I 
worked for the District Attorney 
downtown and write affidavits 
from police reports all day long. 
He told the chief, who looked a 
tad distraught - can't imagine 
why. 

Subsequently, we were released 
on our collective word that we 
wouldn't raise hell at the Price 
Center again that day. We were 
told we could go back if we didn't 
do anything wild. 

I returned and sat next to a 
friend on the steps. A pretty dan-
gerous duo she and I must have 
appeared - me with my subver-
sive sign reading not: "DIE YOU

offensive, huh?). 

Meanwhile, this cop wanders 
over, ripping me off the stairs yel-
ling "Weren't you told not to 
come back to the Price Center!" 
Already in express transit back to 
the station I answered, "No." He 
asked in a sort of Clint Eastwood 
manner, "You ever been to county 
jail? Ever been strip-searched, had 
your asshole searched? Ever been 
thrown in a tiny cell with a bunch 
of boys who're gonna like you a 
whole lot? A whole lot" 

After having nearly relieved me 
of the distal portion of my arm, he 
relaxed his death grip and sent me 
to his superior officer. 

I spoke to him and he agreed 
that I indeed hadn't broken my 
word not to raise hell and released 
me again. 

The cop who yanked me off the 
stairs, I might clarify for the record, 
was complelely mistaken in his

Directed by Michael Powell 

1943 England 35mm 163 minutes 

The West Coast Premiere of the restored English classic 
The Life & Death of Colonel Blimp. Originally sup-
pressed by the British government, Powell's first film has 
finally been restored to its original running time and 
Technicolor. Based on David Low's cartoon character, 
Blimp, traces the war-time history of one English soldier 
through both world wars. We see him change from a 
young en thusiastic soldier to an older, doubting and self-
tortured man. The film contradicts and cuts down the 
often glorified and romantic vision of war, which is what 

caused the British government to censor 
this negative patriotism.

CLASH: CrowdProtesis ERRATA

A protester is transported to the 
police station. 

Continued from pale 3 
[Kile), I overheard a policeman 
say to him, 'Have you ever been 
to county jail? You're going to be 
strip searched and ass-probed. 
There's a whole bunch of guys 
down there that are going to love 
you.' .. 

Other students, including Evan 
Weisenfeld, A.S. commissioner 
of the University Center Board 
felt that "[the protesters) got 
attention, but I don't think that 
people [ were) really listening to 
what they had to say. They looked 

like fools because the whole 
ceremony was over when they 
showed up." 

The demonstration began at 
noon on the gym steps and, 
according to Weisenfeld, many of 
the demonstrators took advan-
tage of the free cake in the ball 
room following the break-up of 
their protest. 

"It was by far the most hypo-
critical thing they could have 
done, ~ Weisenfeld said. "It shows 
me that they were only [protest-
ing) to get attention. ~ 

In its A.S. election result coverage, the Guardian 
failed to report that Matthew Schnurer was elected 
commissioner of programming. 

In an April 20 article, the Guardian reported that 
AS. vice president external candidate Craig Peters 
had no comment concerning his complaints against 
political opponent Mishka Migacz. Peters actually 
had no comment on the AS. campaign.

many years to come." 

Evan Weisenfeld, chairperson 
of the University Center Board, 
then led the actual cutting of the 
ribbon that was tied around the 
building. 

Students and community mem-
bers, most of whom were assem-
bled peacefully to watch the cere-
mony, filled nearly a quarter of 
the Center's plaza. However, not 
a II present were gathered in 
celebration. 

Price Center protesters lined 
one of the entrances to the plaza. 
holding signs and shouting slo-
gans. One protester's sign read, 
"They killed the pub, don't eat 
their grub. H 

Three students were arrested 
for obstructing and delaying police 
officers, while a fourth was appre-
hended for malicious mischief, 
according to Police Detective 
Sergeant Bob Jones. 

Other students expressed con-

and clothing:

cerns over what they considered 
wasted funds . They feel the 
imported Jerusalem stones that 
adorn the walls of the building are 
one example of such waste. 

Weisenfeld responded to the 
expression of such sentiment with 
a query: "The faculty has a nice 
building, why can't the students?" 
He feels the "beautyH of the Price 
Center will contribute to student 
pride. 

The inception of a yearly time 
capsule began Friday as well. 

Among the items stuffed into 
the four-foot by IO-inch cylindri-
cal capsule were newspaper arti-
cles, photographs, a Price Center 
poster, a stuffed Koala, Vice 
Chancellor Joe Watson's business 
card, and a .Roberto·s menu. 

"In addition a flyer handed out 
by protesters of the Center was 
stuck in 10 minutes before the 
time capsule ceremony began," 
Warren College Junior Senator 
Matt Lehrer noted.

The University Board voted for 
the idea of having a time capsule 
idea a year ago, and made arran-
gements for 25 spaces to be 
aBoted in the plaza for the bury-
ing of the capsules. 

According to Lehrer, one time 
capsule will be made and buried 
each year for the next 25 years . In 
the year 2014, UCSD students 
will dig up the first time capsule 
and make a display of the arti-
facts. The first capsule will then 
be recycled and utilized in the 
encasing of items from the gra-
duating class of 2014. 

Lehrer adopted the idea of an 
annual time capsule from Stan-
ford University, which according 
to Lehrer, has been making cap-
sules for approximately the last 
100 years. 

The main reason for the time 
capsule, said Lehrer, was to pro-
mote tradition at UCSD. "UCSD 
doesn't have many tradition ," he 
said .

A.S.: Officials, Candidates Comment 
On Problems in Recent Elections 

are candida tes out there who 
reall/ed the sy tern can be mani-
pulated and they do, in fact, 
manipulate it because the situa-
lion IS so open to manipulation ." 

slate spending problem, feels the 
solution lies in better enforcement 
of the current bylaws. 

"The bylaws are well deSigned ," 
she said . "What . we need is an 
election manager and committee 
to really police the rules," 

Continued from page 1 
in the election bylaw, which many 
feel need reworking to provide for 
an individual candidate running 
independently. 

The current bylaws specify how 
much money a slate of two. thrce, 
or four people may use o n its 
campaign. Those amounts a rc 
significa nt ly greater than thc 
amou nt allowed for an individual 
ca ndidate running independently. 

However. at th is time, the by-
lawsdo not specify how the money 
is to be divided among slate 
members. and. as a result, ca ndi-
dates may enter into a slate and 
lega ll y use the slate's ent ire allot-
men t to publicize only one of its 
member . 

Ramirez feel the bylaw should 
be rewritten to apportion spend-
ing amount equally between 
candidates running fo r the same 

po~ition . 
"[The spending limit] are ter-

nble. They should be more bal-
anced between candidates and 
slates .. . If you are ru nning inde-
pendently you sho uld have the 
sa me amount of money as if you 

were running In a sla te," she said. 
"Basically, you have more power 
in a slate, because the amount of 
spending money [allowed] is 
raised. " 

Dimme dale. who agrees with 
Ramirez, said " We need differe nt 
guidelines about lates and spend-
ing. [We need] a lot more control. 

Earlier this yea.r, Ramirez 
introduced to the A.S. Council 
amendments to the election by-
laws which would have altered 
campaign spending limitation for 
both ca ndidates and lates. 

The amendments were aimed 
at reducing the spending limit for 
slates by a mall amount , whileat 
the same time, increaSing the 
spending limit for individual 
candidates. 

However, because of what 
Ramirez de cribed as a conflict of 
intere ts, the Council rejected her 
propo als. 

"[The propo 'als] would have 
affected some A.S. members who 
were thinking of running this 
year," he aid.

A.S. Council Members Reflect 
On a Year of Campus Politics 
By LAURA PROCTOR 
Senior Staff Writl'f 

When Maynard Dimmesdale 
took the office of A.S. President 
last year, he knew it would be an 
uphill battle. Most council-
members, even if they weren't on 
the Team Unity slate, were 
shocked and disappointed that 
Johnny Patterson had lost the 
election to an outsider. 

Patterson was a member of the 
Team Unity slate, the majority of 
which were elected to office. 
Addressing student rights as one 
of his main campaign issues, 
Dimmesdale surprised many by 
defeating Patterson in a run-off 
election . 

Dimmesdale alienated council-
members almost immediately by 

Maynard Dimmesdale said the 
idea of conflict is to "gel a lot of 
views expressed." 

publicly calling the A.S. council a 
"clique" and resolving to accom-
pli h his goal with or without its 
support. According to Vice 
President-Administrative John 
Robison, ~Maynard's philosophy 
to this day is that if he com-
promises. he won't get what he 
wants." 

"As far as the Maynard thing, 
the bOllom line is the isolation. 
You can't say it was totally h'IS 
fault, because he was the outsider 
on a council of nine or 10 people 
with the slate that the president 
lost on, but then again it was his 
responsibility to change that, and 
he didn't." 

Robison said that Dimmesdale 
has learned through experience 
how to deal more effectively with 
councilmembers, but that "they 
still don't pay attention when he 
stands up, and don't see him as 
leading the council and represent-
ing [their] views." 

Vice President External Mor-
decai Potash feels that "Maynard 
got his ass kicked and then realized 
that if he wants to be the rebel the 
whole year long, then he 's wel-
come to it, but we can play hard-
ball too." 

According to Potash, "What 
[Dimmesdale] learned is that you 
can get what you want without 
being so inflammatory. You don't 
have to be in arthritic condition to 
get what you want done. 
- "He's done an all right job ... 
There've been times when I wanted 
to pull out certain organs from 
the guy's body, but in retrospect 

Tom Rhee said that. as A.S. pres-
ident. "You 've gol to have Cbun-
cil behind you or things are not 
going to get done." 

it's been a pretty good year," he 
aid. 

Potash did say, however, that 
Dimmesdale has been an improve-
ment over past presidents. "It was 
getting to the point," he said, 
" where presidents were really 
politically-minded. I didn't like 
how closely Marchick played with 
the administration, kind of like 
you gOlla scratch their back and 
they' I scratch yours. 

"There were some really good 
people on last year's council, but 
council as a whole was a lot 
quieter, almost afraid to peak up 
to the administration sometimes. 
[Marchick] met with Atkinson all 
the time ... Maynard was a lot 
more open. He let you do what 
you wanted ." 

Public Relations Commissioner 
Tom Rhee said , "I think, in a way, 

with Johnny [Patterson] it would 
have been good because we 
would've personally known each 
other, and we could have had a 
friendlier approach to it, instead 
of conflict [but] It'S hard to say. 
The co-ops and the New Indica-
tor got more out of this council 
than previous councils, and it had 
a lot to do with Maynard." 

Dimmesdale described his con-
flict with council as an asset, not a 
detriment. "We don't want a 
group of people in council who all 
agree with one another, who are 
great friends with one another. 
That's called group think, and 
people are very much in tune with 
not offending other people, in-

when I wanted to pull 
out certain organs from 
the guy's body, but in 
retrospect, it's been a 
pretty good year. "

stead of getting things done," he 
said. 

"I've told the council un-
reservedly, that Idon'tcomprom-
ise. If I like something then I'm 
going to push it, and if they don't 
like it then they should tell me 
'no.' If someone has something 

John Robison feels "i t's better to 
compromise and accomplish half 
of what you set out to do than to 
... gel nothing done." 

better, then ni change it [but] if I 
don't think it's better, then that's 
it - it's not better. If you really 
believe something is great, then 
you shouldn't give it up.n 

According to Robison , the 
shortcomings of this year's coun-
cil were a direct result of the con-
flict with Dimmesdale. "This year, 
Maynard was trying to get every-
one to work on what he wanted to 
work on, regardless of whether or 
not they supported it. He was 
wrong, because it's not that the 
A.S. President is the boss, and the 
one that comes down on everyone 
.. . . The president sets the tone, 
and gets people motivated and 
encourages, and that wasn't done ... 

Dimmesdale maintained that 
"many of the councilmembers 
were not as vigorous in upholding 
their job responsibilities as they 
should have been." He said Ihat 
although he tried to keep them 
informed, many councilmembers 
failed to invest time in learning 
about the issues.

senators will go to the council

Warren Symposium Tackles Tough Legal Issue 
By CHERIE PIATKIEWICZ 
Contributing Wriler 

"We wanted to pass on basic 
information about AIDS through 
the symposium because there are 
such tremendous fears and mi -
conceptions about this disease," 
comme nted Robert Horwitz, 
director of the Law and Society 
Program on campus and one of 
the key organizers of the tenth 
annual Warren Symposium. 

The two-day symposium, whtch 
focused on AIDS and the law, 
consisted of a lecture by Law-
rence Gostin, Professor of Health 
Law at Harvard University, a 
panel d iscussion by five experts 
on the curre nt laws related to 
AIDS patients and their rights, 
and a moot court trial based on a 
hypothetical AIDS discrimination 
case. 

Each year, the Warren Sympo-
sium deals with a contemporary 
legal issue and is directly con-
nected with Law and Society lOt. 

"The class and symposium are 
exciting. We're bringing up com-
pletely new issues that will need to 
be raised and addressed in the 
future," Slated one volunteer wit-
ness for the moot court. 

The moot trial was based on a 
hypothetical case about a metal 
and wood shop teacher who had 
been assigned to administrative 
duties after a confidential report 
by a health profe,sional informed 
the high school principal that the 
teacher tested HIV positive. The 
principa l. not knowing the facts, 

assumed that the teacher, Barry 
Cruz, had AIDS and, before she 
had the actual H I V test results on 
her desk, re-assigned Cruz to a 
filing job. 

Attorney Timothy Pestotnik, 
chairperson of the board for the 
San Diego AIDS Project and The 
Bar Association AIDS Law and 
Policy Commissions, played the 
la wyer for the plaintiff, Cruz. Pes-
totnik, who is currently handling 
the only AIDS discrimination case 
in San Diego's coun sys tem, 
pointed out the lack of significant 
fisk Cruz posed to his students. 

Sergio Trevino, a UCSD stu-
dent who is part of the Law and 
Society Program, played Cruz. 

Professor of Law and Society 
101, Peter Irons, enacted the role 
of the defending school district 's 
attorney. He examined the theo-
retical possibility of an accident 
involving Cruz and a tudent in 
which the exchange of H IV-
contaminated blood could take 
place. 

Witnesses consisted of Trevino 
who, a s Cruz, stressed his ac-
cident-free record and classroom 
safety precautions, and another 
volunteer as the uninformed high 
school principal who thought she 
was doing the right thing by pro-
tecting the students. 

The third witness, Dr. Shawn 
Harrity, a San Diego medical 
expert on AIDS, played herself. 
In her testimony, she pointed out 
the less than one percent possibil-
ity of an exchange of H IV in the 
classroom. 

Harrity ~upported her state-

ment with stattsttcs from The 
Center For Disease Control 
(CDC) on accidental needle-stick 
incidents . Of the 1250 health care 
workers in the center that acci-
dentally st uck themselves with an 
HIV contami nated needle, only 
four actually contracted the virus. 

Approximately 450 high school 
students from all parts of San 
Diego County attended the moot 
trial and panel discussion. Twelve 
high school students were ran-
domly chosen to act as ju rors . 
Instead of deliberating privately, 
the jllror~ openly gave their indi-

vidual verdicts and reasons for 
their decisions. 

The jury was split, eight favored 
Cruz returning to his duties as 
shop teacher and four believed 
Cruz should not be able to teach. 

Those in favor of Cruz return-
ing to the cia sroom felt the 
defendant had not shown Cruz's 
HIV positive condition to be a 
significant risk because he had no 
previous classroom injuries and 
followed the proper safety regula-
tions . The four who voted against 
Cruz believed that any chance, 
however slight, of a student con-

tracting the HI V virus in the 
classroom was too great a risk. A 
show of hands from the audience 
demonstrated they overwhelm-
inglyagreed with the majority of 
the jury. 

The judge, played by Sheldon 
Krantz, Professor of Law at USD. 
also agreed with the majority 
because he felt the defense had 
failed to display a significant risk 
factor. 

Earlier in the day, a board of 
panel members discussed the pros 
and cons of mandatory HIV test-

Politics 
Continued from page 10 
meetings and their college council 
meetings. Very few senators made 
both of those meetings," he said . 

Robison agreed that senators 
in particular should have been 
more involved in the council, but 
altibutes their lack of participa-
tion in part to Dimmesdale's pol-
itical style. 

"I don't think anyone on the 
council was of subnormal poten-
tial, and [Dimmesdale] was just 
throwing away that potential at 
the beginning, by saying that what 
you guys want to do is not impor-
tant - this is what I want to do. 

"The inconsistency I think is 
the biggest problem that they 
faced. No o ne really knew where 
they were going, because the 
leadership wasn't there ... 

Despite the infighting, this 
year 's council made great pro-
gress in the area of student rights. 
Dimmesdale cites the a ppoint-
ment of Bard -Alan Finlan to the 
S tudent Advocate position as his 
greatest triumph this year. 

Initially, council opposed the 
appointment because, according 
to Robiso n, " he chose a non-
status quo, outspoken Student 
Advocate. That rubbed a lot of 
people the wrong way." R obison 
also sa id that Finlan ha s earned 
the support and respect of the 
council. 

" I don't think we've - at least 
in the three years I've been here -
had a Student Advocate dedicated 
to searching through everything 
and finding out what's wrong and 
ex posing it; having so many 

admi nistrators admit, 'Yes, we 
don) follow our own rules. but 
we're not going to follow them 
until you call us on it,' .. he said. 

Potash also stressed that "the 
stu dents do need a really great 
student government to protect 
their rights in the UC system, 
because the administrators don't 
put undergraduate's needs first." 

According to Potash, the most 
important thing council accomp-
lished this year was working to 
defeat the administration's plan 
for a new recrea tion center. The 
center would have increased the 
q uarter recreation facility fee to 
approximately 560, and Potash 

Guardian 
"When Bard-Alan [Finlan) came 
in, he was just thrown in to this 
pool of aggressiveness, so he 
was really agressive." 

says there's a 99 percent chance 
the administrators will try to push 
the idea through next year. 

"They want it to be a cosmopol-
itan, everything-campus, which is 
great. I have nothing against that. 
I would really enjoy that weight-
room, but I'd rather work out in 
Canyonview than have students 
pay 560 a quarter." 

Dimmesdale agrees with Pot-
ash and Robison on the topic of 

The 

FEATURES 
. administators violating student 

rights and ignoring student input. 
"There are a few administra-

tors who are j ust really, really 
bad . as far as student input, a nd 
the chancellor is one of them. He 
doesn't want to hear about stu-
dents , and he's not at all con-
cerned about students. The chan-
cellor and the vice-chancellors are 
the ones that really count in this 
administration, a nd they're the 
ones that frequently are not really 
receptive to student input," he 
said . 

" When it came to the bottom 
line," Rhee sa id , "we voted in the 
best interests of the students, and 
not [because 01] personal con-
nicts ."

the cons outweigh the pros of 
mandatory testing due to the high

and patient confidentiality.

Ligerman to make the score 8-3. 
Fisher had another strong outing, 
going all the way to improve his 
record to 5-1. 

In the second game, the Tritons 
kept up their offensive attack by 
scoring in every inning but the 
sixth to down The Master's, 9-3. 

Home runs by Gene Northway 
and Martinez helped give UCSD 
starter Rick Rupkey his ninth win 
of the year. Rupkey allowed live 
hits and three runs over six 
innings, and Mike Morgan pitched 
an inning of scoreless relief. 

Both Henry Jimene~ and Matt 
Bynum went two-for-two in the 
second game for UCSD. 

The Master's Head Coach Pat 
Harrison explained that the Trit-
ons" ... had relentless pressure on 
us all day and never allowed our 
pitchers to settle down and get

UCSD will be able to test its 
philosophy as the regular season 
comes to a close with double-
headers against Loyola Mary-
mount, Whittier, and USD. The 
latter split with the Tritons 
earlier this season. 

"Every game is important for 
us," Bassi said. "We're just going 
to have to play good ball the rest 
of the way." 

UCSD took both games of a 
doubleheader against Division II 
UC Riverside on Thursday. 3-1 
and 4-3 (in nine innings). Kathy 
Fogg (7-2) won both games for 
the Tritons, and Tracey Kehr's 
bat sparked the come-from-
behind victory in game two as she 
went four-for-seven on the day 
and scored twice.

the brink of victory, leading 4-1 
and needing only one win to seal 
the match. Park, struggling to 
keep the Tritons alive, slipped by 
Kenji Hashimoto 6-4, 3-6, 6-4. 

The win allowed the teams to 
play doubles and gave the Tri-
tons, down 4-2, new life. Just as 
they've done all season, the dou-
bles teams came through. Huber-
8elloli quickly defeated the team 
of Lance Au-Peter Gertminian 6-
3,6-3 to silence the partisan crowd 
of 100. Mark-Ditzler then ~on 
6-3, 1-6, 6-2 to tie the match at 
four. 

Attention shifted to the final 
match at No. 2 doubles where 
Monnar-French were locked in a 
close match with Eric Chan-Hashi-
moto. Monnar-French took the 
first set 7-5, dropped the second 
3-6, and jumped to a 4-1 lead. The 
Stags then rebounded to pull 
within 5-4 with Chan - who 
hadn't been broken all match -
serving for the tie. Playing with 
the no advantage scoring system, 
the game was deadlocked at three. 
Chan hit a good serve that Mon-
nar managed to lob back. The 
Triton players returned three more 
Stag overheads before Hashimoto 
missed wide to give UCSD the 
victory and secure its berth in the 
National Championships. 

With the win, the Tritons 
improved to 14- 10 (10- 1 in Div-
i ion III ). They have beaten five 
teams ranked in the top 10 in the 
division. Their only loss was to 
No. I UC Santa Cruz.

The Tritons completed their 

season aturday by trouncing 
Occidental College 8-1. 

They dominated every match 
except No. I singles, sweeping to 
victory without losing a set. 

The only match they lost was at 
the top where Christine Behrens, 
the fourth seed in the Western 
Region. fell to its second seed, Sue 
Hulse, 1-6,6-2, 6'{). 

With the victory, the Tritons 
complete their season at 15-5. 
They have a very strong chance of 
qualifying for the Division III 

ational Tournament May 8-13

give the team a convincing victory

"Our doubles teams are really

"They used to be our Achilles

Track and Field 
At Saturday's Pomona-Pitzer 

Invitational, Andrea Kouremetis 
and Rachel Beerman qualified for 
the Division III National Cham-
pionships with a 25.28 time in the 
200 meters and a 137'5" discus 
throw, respectively. Shannon Quig-
ley won the discus event when she 
broke her own school record and 
simultaneously recorded this 
year's national high with a throw 
of 153'2*. 

New school records were also 
set by Vicki Dunkley with a 68.29 
time in the 400 hurdles and by the 
men's 4x400 relay team with a 
3:22.32 clocking. 

Gisele English won the 1500 
meters at 4:46.34. 

Yesterday, Michelle Conlay 
joined the National qualifying 
ranks with a 36:56.2 finish in the 
10,000 meters, Con lay joins Kou-
remetis, Beerman, and three other 
Tritons - Quigley, Scott Sar-
geant, and Marc Lawler - who

trounced 13-4. 

Hungary, USA Take Care of 
Triton Women's Water Polo 

The Tritons (8-7-1) lost two 
games on Saturday - but they 
were games nobody expected 
them to win; one to the United 
States National Team (13-7) 
and the other to the Hungarian 
National Team. 

On Friday night at Canyon-
view, Hungary beat the U.S. 
10-9. 

Against Hungary, the Trit-
ons fell behind 3'{) early and 
were never able to climb back. 
into it. Though UCSD scored 
twice in the first period and 
twice more in the second, 
Hungary held an 8-4 lead at 
halftime and cruised to a 14-4 
victory. 

The Hungarian Coach, who 

spoke through an interpreter, 
pointed out that, 1The Trit-
ons] were good, but still no 
problem for us ." 

Triton Coach Denny Harper, 
on the other hand, felt that 
UCSD played well. "It was 

definitely a good performance," 
he said of his team. "It wasn't 
just [Hungary] scoring at will. 
We gave them some problems ... 

The Hungarians enjoyed a 
semi-typical Southern Califor-
nia vacation during their visit, 
traveling to Disneyland, Hol-
lywood, and then Billy Bones, 
a popular San Diego dance 
club. The team members pres-
ented the Triton women with 
Hungarian flags after the game.

Big Wins Secure National 
Berth for Men's Tennis 
By BRIAN ITOW 
Contributing Sports Editor 

The Triton swept their way 
to the National with two ·big 
wins over seventh-ranked Po-
mona-Pitzer and eighth ranked 
Claremont-Mudd this week-
end. 

Only 10 team make the 
Divi ion III ational Cham-
pionship. With 12 quality 
squad vying for the positions, 

losses to Claremont-Mudd or 
Pomona-Pitzer would have 
eriously jeopardized the Triton 

playoff hopes. 
Pomona-Pitzer entered the 

match undefeated at 20-0, and 
looked as if it was going to 
cruise to victory as its top two

and Reid Newhall, quickly 
defeated Sig Huber and Fran-
coi Monnar in singles. But

Seven in a Row for Third-Ranked Softball 

Tritons Sweep Redlands 
By TRA VIS L. SCOTT 
Contributing Writer 

There is a fine line between a 
good softball team and a great 
one. A good team is one that wins 
games with a lot of skill and just a 
little luck. A great team needs no 
luck. 

On Saturday afternoon, UCSD 
(28-7) made the distinction quite 
clear as it dominated visiting Red-
land in every facet of the game, 
and cruised to an easy double-
header sweep, 5-1 and 10-1. 

The Tritons, ranked third in 
the nation and second in the West 
Region, have won even in a row 
(including three straight double-
headers), and have paved their 
way for a pot in next month's 
Regional playoffs. 

"The girls are doing a great job. 
They're hitting well, pitching well, 
and really executing," Triton Co-
Head Coach Lin Adams said. 
"We're working together and all 
the little things are beginning to 
come together. We just need to 
continue playing good ball." 

Although it is not one of the 
top teams, Redlands has proven 
to be a tough opponent for UCSD 
thi eason. While the Tritons had 
won the previous three meetings, 
it was no easy matter as the Bull-

dogs forced one game into extra 
innings and lost a one-run deci-
sion in another. 

"We knew we had our work cut 
out for us," Adams said. "But we 
were really up for this game." 

"Their record is not indicative 
of the caliber of ballclub they 
are," Co-Head Coach Lisa Bassi 
pointed out. "They always play us 
tough." 

Until Saturday. Redlands never 
had a chance, as UCSD scored all 
15 of its run in the first two 
innings of both games. 

In game one, the Tritons were 
led by the powerful pitching of 
Lynn Moreno (6-1), who surren-
dered only one run on four hits 
while striking out five. Moreno, 
who went the distance, began the 
game by retiring the first eight 
batters in order. 

UCSD jumped out with three 
runs in the first inning on singles 
by Moreno, Debbie Branstetter, 
and Michelle Flaska, and a key 
triple by Michelle Mundee who 
was three-for-four with two runs 
scored and a stolen base. Moreno, 
who went two-for-four, picked up 
an RBI in the inning when she 
knocked in Mundee on a per-
fectly executed suicide squeeze. 

and a stolen base, and Pam Har-
nack added a two-for-three per-
formance with a stolen base. 

The Bulldog's lone run came in 
the third when Moreno's only 
walk on the day was followed by 
three straight singles to center. 
Moreno then settled down to 
strike out the next three batters in 
order. 

In game two, Stacie Sasaki (7-
I) turned in another excellent 
pitching performance for the Tri-
tons as she went seven innings, 
giving up one run on only four 
hits and striking out three. 

UCSD jumped out early again , 
thi time coming up with four 
runs in the first on singles by 
Dana Chaiken, Mundee, and 
Moreno. Chaiken, who went two-
for-three, had two stolen bases in 
the inning and Mundee layed 
down the Tritons' second success-
ful suicide squeeze on the day. 

Redlands came back with one 
of its own in the second when a 
single and a sacrifice put Tina 
Peterson on third with two outs. 
When Tracey Kehr's _pickoff at-
tempt 80t by Mundee, who was 
covering third, the run scored. 

Baseball Educates The Master's 

The Tritons came up with two 
more in the second on singles by 
Mundee and Julie SteIman. Two 
errors and a hit batter followed to 
help cap off the scoring. 

Branstetter ended up one-for-
three with an RBt, a run scored, 

The Tritons put the game away 
when they scored six times in the 
bottom half of the second on 
seven singles. Sasaki had two hits 
in the inning, off of two different 
pitchers, as UCSD sent 10 batters 
to the plate. Kathy Fogg, who 
won both games of Friday's dou-

UCS D greatly boosted its 
chances of making thi year' 
regional playoffs when it soundly 
defeated The Master's College 8-3 
a nd 9-3 in a doubleheader Satur-
day afternoon at Olsen Field in 
front of a small, but boisterous 
crowd. 

By sweeping the doubleheader, 
the Tritons (ranked eighth in Div-
ision III) improved their record to 
20-15. Head Coach Lyle Yates 
pointed out that the wins "should 
put us in the driver's seat for one 
of the two playoff spots in the Far 
West Regionals." 

Coach Yates was very satisfied 
with his team's performance. "We 
played two of our most complete 
games of the year," he aid . "We 
played well in all aspects of the 
game." 

In the first game, The Master's 
took an early I -0 lead getting 
three hits off Triton starter J .J. 
Fisher in the first. UCSD quickly 
tied the score in the second inning 
on hot-hitting Gary Fessia 's eighth 
home run of the year. The next 
batter, John Martinez, doubled 
to left and later scored on a 
passed ball the make the score 
2-1. 

The Master's tied the score in

the third inning, but UCSD struck 
for three runs in the bottom half 
of the inning to take a 5-2 lead 
that it never relinquished . After a 
walk, a bloop single, and a sacri-
fice bunt , Chris Murphy drove in 
two runners with a sharp single to 
left. Murphy took second base on 
the throw to the plate, and then 
scored on a single to right by 
Fessia. 

After The Master' cut the lead 
to 5-3 in the fifth, UCSD manu-

, factured a run of its own. With 
two outs, Fessia started things 
with a single and went to third on 

a double down the left field line 
by catcher Jim Martinez. After 
waiting a few pitches, Fessia 
sprinted for home as Mustang 
pitcher Roger March started hi 
slow delivery, and scored on a 
clo e play at the plate to put 
UC D back up by three, 6-3. 

In the sixth, Fessia showed he 
was more than a one-dimensional 
player when he made a perfect 
throw to the plate from center 
field to cut down a Mustang try-
ing to score on a fly ball. 

Keeping up the offensive pres-
ure, UCSD cored two more 

runs in the bottom of the sixth on 
a sacrifice fly by Henry Jimenez 
and a run-scoring si ngle by Dave

The Tritons completed their 
waltz through the Pacific Coast 
Volleyball Conference by slam-
ming the door on the U niver-
sity of La Verne 15-3, 12-15, 
15-5, 15-1 J. 

The victory secured first 
place and the top seed in the 
next weekend's conference 
tournament as the Tritons fin-
ished undefeated in a league 
they dominated. 

After struggling against more 
talented Division I teams, 
UCSDentered Conference play 
ready to prove that it was the 
best "small school" in volley-
ball - and it did just that. It 
lost only two of eighteen games 
in league play while displaying 
the skills and talent that have 
made them the 20th ranked 
team in men's volleyball. 

Ifthe Leopards weren't awed 
by the display that the Tritons 
put on earlier at UCSD when 
the Tritons swept them, they 
were convinced at La Verne. 

The Tritons dominated the 
nets, both offensively and def-

ensively. They -.ad four hitters 
that reached double figures in 
kills: Nick Rothman had 16 
kills, Nate Brown 14, John 
Davey 13, and Jeff Babcock 
12. Their strong and varied 
offense was led by John 
Childers who had 59 assists. 

The Tritons' defense on the 
nets never allowed the Leopard 
offense to get going. They 
recorded 24 block assists and 
allowed La Verne few oppor-
tunities to hit into the UCSD 
backcourt. 

UCSD Head Coach Digger 
Graybill was pleased with his 
team's performance, "It showed 
what we're capable of doing. 
We have the talent to domi-
nate if we can play at a consist-
ently high level. 

"The victory over La Verne 
was important," he said, "be-
cause we let them know we can 
perform at a high level in their 
gym. We can use it as a step-
ping stone to victory in the 
tourney." 

The Tritons will face fourth 
seeded Chapman College when 
the tournament opens Friday 
evening at La Verne. The Leo-
pards will face UC Santa Cruz 
in the econd semifinal.
