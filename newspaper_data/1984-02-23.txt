Several important changes in the 

educational policy and requirements of 
UCSD have JUSt been announced. Next 
quarter, UCSD will join seven other UC 
campuses in aUowing students to take 
courses on a pass-fail basis. Only unit 
credit Will be given for any class taken 
under this sytem. Students will be 
allowed to take up to 25% of their total 
work load on this basis.

Diabetic and non-diabetic adults are 
needed to participate in nutritional 
studies being conducted at the UCSO 
School of Medicine. The purpose of 
these studies IS to evaluate the impact of 
various foods on blood sugar levels in 
normal and diabetic individuals. 
Researchers are currently finding that 
some of the old theories conceming 
how food affects diabetics are incorrect. 
For example, ice cream has been found 
to cause practically no elevation in 
blood glucose, while potatoes send 
glucose levels way up. Subjects are 
needed for four hospital visits and must 
eat speciaUy-prepared foods and then 
have samples of blood drawn [or glucose 
measurement. Participants must be 
between 25 and 65 years of age, and m 
good health, or with no health problems 
other than non-Insuhn treated diabetes. 
For their participation, subjects will 
receive payment and a complete 
physical examination. For more

CalPlRG announced a new drive to 

enact a Califomia "Bonle Bill" which 
would encourage the recycling of bottles 
and reduce litter. The bill, which was 
Introduced by State Senator Dan 
McCorquodale, reqUires that beer and 
soft drink cans and bottles be retumable 
for a nickel deposit. States that have the 
bottle bill in effect have shown an 80% 
reduction in container litter, and a one-
third drop in total litter. Recycli ng rates 
have climbed from less than 30% to 
better than 80%. "The fact is that Bonle

Sources at the UC Board of Regents 

meeting m San Francisco yesterday 
indicated that a century of tuition-free 
education at the Universiry of Califomia 
is about to come to an end . The Regents 
are expected to pass a fee increase of 
some sort today. 

1971... 
The formation of a new campus 

organization concerned with mforming 
students about their legal rights and 
proViding a forum for the rational 
discussion of controversial issues 
affecting the Umversiry was announced 
laSl week by a group of UCSD students. 

, The first projer.:t of the UCSD Legal 

"If we can get some controversial referendums on the ballot,l expect at least 
25% of the student body to vote in the spring elections," said Bill Ansell, AS 
Commissioner of Elections. Filing for the April 18 and 19 elections will run 
during the tenth week of classes, March 12-16, and the first week of spring 
quarter, April 2-9. 

Ansell is conducting a vigorous campaign to stimulate student interest in 
running for office. "What I am looking for is firSl to help those candidates 
runnmg for president of the AS Council to better underSland their duties and 
how to publicize their pOSitions," said Ansell. "And any candidate interested in 
running for office should contact Marc Boroditsky or myself to find out what 
their Job would entail." Boroditsky has been circulating questionnaires among 
the AS officers to bener define council members' responsibilities m preparation 
for the upcoming election. 

Those interested In becoming a candidate must: file for only one office; 
obtain a Candidate Endorsement Petition; submil the proper number of 
petition signatures for the desired office (president requires 200 signatures, 
commissioner candidates 100 and College Representatives 50); and be an 
enrolled full-time undergr.!duate at UCSO With at least a 2.0 GPA and attend the 
Mandatory Candidate's Meeting called by the Elections Commission. 

Many sutdents have already realized this and taken upon themselves more 
serious attitudes towards the AS elections. Third College Council has submitted 
a proposal expressing its interest in improving the quality of its Third College 
Representative . The proposal reads: 

"Whereas a Third College AS Representative is an Imponam 
position; whereas a Third College representative must be a~le to 
express and support the ideas of the Third College; whereas a Third 
College representative must be able to work with Third College 
Council; whereas Leadership Training Camp teaches the goals and 
ideas of Third College and promotes a working relationship 
between student leaders: therefore be it hereby resolved that to 
qualify as a candidate for Third College AS representative a person 
must have previously attended Leadership Training Camp, so that 
the goals and ideas of Third College are properly represented and 
the s[Udent leaders can work together." 

To improve the AS e1ecuons and council, Ansell has submitted a referendum 
to move the elections up to the laSl week of winter quarter. "By having the 
elections in the winter we can train the new officers during the spring quarter. 
Many of our problems thus stemmed from having to vore on issues before we 
had time to get acquainted with our positiOns," Ansell said. "Also, I want a 
referendum to make the Election Commissioner a non-voting, paid pOSition. 
My duties are focused during the twO intensive weeks of elections, when I wiD be 
expected to work 50-60 hours. Future Election Commissioners should only be 
required to work during the election when they are needed: 

"The real power positions on the council are Appointments and Evaluations, 
Programming, and Activity Fee Commissioners." commented Ansell. And, as 
anyone who attends AS Council meetings will notice, another power position is 
AS Vice President, which will be the subject of a fUMe AS Forum.

Peter Irons' case: 
a 60 Minutes feature 
By .PHIL WILLON 

UCSO's professor Peter Irons 
appeared on 60 Minutes last Sunday, 
and told the nation about his role in 
proving the intemment of over 110,000 
JapaneseÂ·Americans during World War 
II was a "grave injustice" that resulted 
from "race prejudice, war hysteria and a 
failure of political leadership." 

In his interview with Ed Bradley, 
professor Irons described the evidence 
he uncovered involving the Supreme 
Court cases of Fred Korematsu; Gorden 
Hirabayashi and Minoru Yasui. 

All three men had been convicted for 
failing to comply with President 
Roosevelt's Executive Order 9066, 
requiring that all Japanese-Americans be 
removed from the West Coast. Their 
cases set a precedent that upheld the 
legality of the entire internment. (See 
the January 30 Guardian cover Slory for 
more details.) 

"I discovered that the government's 
own lawyers in the Justice Department 
during the prosecution of these cases 

during the appeals, and even prior 10 
the Supreme Coun decision had 
concluded that the evidence presented 
10 the courtS alleging that miUtary 
necessiry required the evacuation and 
internment was fraudulent ." 

Professor Irons had found documents 
belonging to the FBI and the Federal 
Communications Commission stating 
that there existed no evidence of 
Japanese-Americans Signaling enemy 
submarines off the coast as the military 
charge had claimed. 

Because of this new-found 
information, the show went on to say, 
the convictions of Fred Korematsu and 
Minoru Yasui were overturned. Gordon 
Hirabayashi's retrial is still pending. 

Professor Irons also defended a 
proposed montary redress for all those 
interned in a debate against Dr. Ken 
Masugi, resident fellow at the Claremont 
Institute, which was held at UCSD IaSl 
Friday. 

In 1963, the Commission on Wartime 

Political science professor Irons was jeatured on rhis segment of 60 MINUTES last Sunday.

UCSD Professor Peter Irons in last week's debate against Dr. Ken Magusi. 

Relocation and Internment of Civilians 
recommended payments of $20,000 to 
the Japanese-Americans who were sent 
to the camps. It also called for a solemn 
national apology and the creation of an 
educational foundation to aid all 
Japanese-Americans. It is now a bill 
being sponsored by Alan Cranston in 
the Senate. 

Dr. Masugi called the commission's 
repon "fatally flawed" and "intellectually 
dishoneSl," while professor Irons argued 
that in America, "If you are damaged 
through the act of another you are 
entitled t6 compensation ." 

It was a heated debate, but the 
advantage was clearly Irons'. Because it 
was held at his own universiry, he had 
the full suppon of the audience, which 
Included Citizens who had been 
interned. 

Dr. Masugi is a Japanese-American; 
his parents were sem to the camps 
during the war. "I'm not a defender of 
what happened to my parents in World 
War II," he said of his predicament, 
"I've had to think very hard of justice 
and equality." He added that his 
involvement was stricdy on issues of 
principle , not national origin. 

According to Masugi , the 
commission's repon contained 
numerous flaws, saying that it did not 
take into account the people responsible 
for the internment or the ci rcumstances 
they were In when it was implimented. 

"Pearl Harbor was bombed, and who 
was to know what would follow," he 
commented. "The loyalty of the ethniC 
Japanese at the time could be 
questioned."

Dr. Masugi's letter to 60 Minutes 
To the Producers or 60 M1NIJIfES and Reporter Ed Bradley, 

I wish to comment on your segment of February 19 on the ethnic Japanese 
relocation, which was another unfortunate example-of television oversimplification of 
an important Slory. Omissions of crucial facts in recounting that sad episode have 
marred the media's coverage of it throughout the paSl 12 months, and 60 MINUTES 
has followed suit. 

I list some of the major misSlatements and omissions. The repon did not mention 
that evacuees could petition to leave the camps if they had jobs or a place in college 
outSide the West CoaSl. 

Examples of pOtencial ethnicJapanese disloyalry to the United States are pointed to 
in such scholarly respected works as Gordon pra1's At Dawn We Slept and John J 
Stephans' Hawaii Under the RisIng Sun: Japan 's Plans or Conquest i!(ter Pearl Harbor. Or 
consider the characterization in the novel regarde as the greatjapanese-American 
novel, John Okada's The No-No Boy. This is not to imply that most or even sizable 
numbers were disloyal, but rather that reasonable grounds for supposing loyalty to a 
mother ethnic country and hence disloyalry to America. 

It is a gross oversimplification to imply that national anceSlry has no relationship to 
the opinions concerning the conduct of American foreign policy. Consider Samuel 
Lubell's study of German-American voters, The Future of American Politics. That 
America Slrives to be a nation of many nations means that it teSls itself by higher 
standards than other nations. This results in national tensions, which we should be 
surprised to see do not break out more often, in more vicious ways. 

Your report failed to mention that Yasui was not only a member of the US military 
but also had been employed by the Japanese Consulate. This is not to imply that he 
was disloyal in anyway, but ratherthat there could be reasonable suspicion about hun. 

The commission, albeit bipartisan, was comprised fundamentally of men of 
extremely liberal views, for example: Arthur Goldberg; Edward Brooke; Father Robert 
Orman; and Arthur S. Flemming. Peter Irons, whom I debated last Friday at UCSD, is 
so devoted to the left wing critique of American politiCS that he spent two years in a 
federal prison for protesting the draft in the very early '60s. (This he recounts in the 
preface of his first book, The New Deal La"yer5.) 

It is extremely dangerous for one ethnic group to be identified with a narrow 
spectrum of political opinion such men represent. 

In discussing the Korematsu case, you assume that it involved only maners of civil 
liberty. In fact, it dealt fundamentally with the powers of the federal government in 
time of war. Overruling the deciSIOn now, almost 40 years later, wiD have graver 
consequences for the way Americans enviSIOn this nation 's responsibilities in times of 
crisis than It will for their regard for civil liberties. 

FinaUy, a word to my fellow younge r Japanese-Americans: you cannot make 
politiCS the arena for the working out of psychological self,doubts and 
mse(;urities without distorting the aims of American political life. Our parents 
and grandparents were judged by their nationality (not race, Slrictiy speaking, in 
the way we use the word today), a shared nationality with a nation that brutally 
atul(;ked the United States. That we today be judged by our character and not 
our national origins cannot be secured by the superfiCial reporting 60 MINUTES 
indulges in or by the shoddy scholarship displayed in the Relocation 
Commission's report and recommendations. That noble aim depends on what 
we accomplish with our lives today, free of the distortions caused by a twisted 
romanticist concerning events 40 years past.

Capital punishment: A 
question of deterrence? 
By PETER DeMARZO 

I would like to respond to the 
Commentary regarding capital 
punishment which appeared in 
the February 13 issue of the 
Guardian. In that anicle. the 
author. Kevin Chukes. concludes 
that. given evidence that 
executions did in fact have some 
deterrent effect. he would 
suppon the use of the death 
penalty. 

promotion is the basis of the 
ju~;nfication of that SOCial system. 
Thus, I shall present several 
instances of the detrimental 
influence the death penalty 
might have on sociery. 

One problem with the state's 
l1Se of its authority to execute 
individuals is the small, but 
extremely serious, risk of 
mistakes. Killing an innocent 

It is unlikely that a substantial 
deterrent effect exists ... further 
considerations lead to a denouncement of 
the death penalty. 

However, in arriving at his 
conclusion, the writer 
prematurely conceded the more 
serious moral and social issues of 
the debate in favor of empirical 
ones. Although it IS unltkely that 
a substantial deterrent effect 
exists, there are funher 
considerations which lead the 
cautious observer to a 
denouncement of the death 
penalty. 

There are other arguments 
justifying the aims of society 
beyond simple cost/ benefit 
analysis or the utili ty of 
deterrence. In considering the 
sanctions needed to uphold a 
valued social system, one must 
consider not only the 
preyentative effect of 
pUnishments on the frequency of 
Infractions, but also the effect of 
those punishments on those ' 
SOCietal values whose very 

person would be an irrevocable 
error with tremendous moral 
consequences fo r the victim, the 
victim's relatives. friends and all 
others involved. Funher, the 
discovery of such an error, or 
any circumstance which subjects 
the legitimacy of the execution to 
public doubt, would severely 
reduce the sense of security 
provided by, and the degree of 
respect given to the system. 

The use of the death penalty 
places a grave responsibility on 
those involved in the case. The 
intolerance to error of this form 
of punishment tremendously 
amplifies the severity and 
importance of the actions on the 
judges, juries, lawyers, jailers and 
executioners inevitably 
aSSOCiated with a prisoner's trial , 
conviction , sentence and 
execution. Many lawyers refuse, 
on grounds of conscience, to 

take pan in capital cases. One 
must then question the state's 
authority, in a civilized society, 
to require the Involvement of its 
ci tizens in such a task. 

A senous objection to capital 
pUnishment is the possibility of 
Its use by the state as a means of 
social control. Indeed , capital 
punishment represents a severe 
and ceremonious exercise of 
power which strengthens the 
power of a centralized state and 
reinforces the underlying societal 
structures of hierarchy and 
authOrity upon which that power 
is predicated. 

The state chooses as capital 
criminals those who act on the 
street or at home in isolated 
incidences; not industrial 
executives, who promote and 
profit from an occupational 
workplace responsible for 
100,000 deaths per year from 
preventable disease (this figure 
according to a 1972 repon 

A publiCized execution 
dramatizes the power of the state 
(to maste r and use the 
convicted), focusing public 
attention on the guilt of a select 
few individuals who are, for the 
most pan, the product of societal 
mistreatment , and also heightens 
public ignorance of the use of 
such power in other forms of 
death-dealing. 

In light of the arguments JUSt 
presented, together with the high 
cost of capital punishment 
(constitutional implementation of 
the death penalty results in a 
penal system far more expensive 
than one with Ii fe 
imprisonment). It is curious that 
the death penalty has invariably 
been reponed to enjoy a high 
degree of public suppon in this 
country. 

On the whole , however, public 
opinion data have been collected 
simplistically, with little attempt 
made to understand the

The seventh week and 
the pretty white room 
By PHIL lAUDER 

College students know that time is 
measured not in months and years but 
rather in weeks - weeks of the quaner. 
The first week involves crashing classes, 
standing in stupid lines and spending 
$150 for $30 worth of books. The 
second week gives us the deadline for 
adding classes. The founh week is the 
latest we can drop classes without a silly 
"W' appearing on our transcripts. The 
fifth and sixth weeks are midterm 
weeks. The ninth week tS the last week 

. to punt out of a class we should never 

and blindly pick something. 
The worst pan of the whole thing IS 

the loneliness. There IS a feeling of 
abject frustration in seeing every person 
around you rush down to the bookstore 
to get their schedules for next quaner 

figu~d out as soon as possible. Towards 
the end of my undeclaredness, the mere 
sight of these people would become 
unbearable. In the lecture halls students 
discussed their schedules; I stopped 
going to class. Friends called up to tell 
me about their selections and ask me 

There is nothing I dread more than scheduling 
classes. I hate it. Sure, I know some people get into 
scheduling classes. Some people are loons, that's all. 

have wasted our time with In the first 
place. And last bur cenamly least, there's 
fi nals week. 

There is, however, one other 
important week of the quaner. To me it 
is the most devastating of all. Midterms 
are a breeze, finals a Sunday stroll 
compared to the terror and anguish that 
this week hastens fonh each quaner. I'm 
talking about the seventh week: the 
week the class schedules come OUl. 

There is norhing I dread more than 
scheduling classes. I hate it. Sure, I 
know some people get into it. Some 
people are loons, that's an. 

It does nor take a psychoanalyst to 
determine the roots of my deep-seated 
tear of class schedules. Every seventh 
Monday of the quaner, while still an 
undeclared major, I would wake up in 
the middle of the night in a deep sweat 
to a neon sign that read, Â·Phil - YOU 
HAVE NO MAJOR. YOU ARE AIMLESS. 
GET A CLUE: Oh God , not the seventh 
week again. 

When you're undeclared, class 
schedules serve only to remind you that 
general ed. requirements are running out 
fast, and it's time to either make an 
intelligent, rational, career-type decision 
or to throw a bunch of majors into a hat 

about mine; I unplugged my phone. Lest 
I be seen at all, I hid myself in the 
eucalyptus trees. From my lookout I saw 
tens and hundreds of smiling freaks, 
travelling hither and thither with those 
despicable brown or blue or green 
pamphlets. I shivered. These people are 
lunalics. I screamed down at them, 
"You're mad, mad! Mad! - AU of you, 
MAD!" 

* * â€¢ 

A couple months in that pretty white 
room cleared my thoughts. After two 
years of aimlessness, I headed into the 
AMES Depanment. After announcing my 
major decision , most who had known of 

. my problem before told me I hadn't 
spent quite enough time in that pretty 
white room. I didn't understand. 

So now I have a major, and the arrival 
of the UCSD Â·Schedule of Classes' no 
longer seems quite the nightmare it 
once was. But I still loathe the seventh 
week. I remember the pain vividly, and 
the neon sign still glows somewhere 
deep within my memory. 

As for all you still-undeclared majors 
out there , well, now you know someone 
else has been there. Someone else cares.

extremely little about the death penalty 
and simply responded to factual 
questions regarding it in ways consistent 
with their positions. Indeed, many 
respondents stated that even if their 
knowledge of the facts was wrong, they 
would not change lhei r stands on the 
issue. As noted by the researchers, thiS 
result suggests that these opinions are 
"emotionally tied to an ideolOgical self-
image and .. . are tightly bound up with 
deeply held convicuons concerning the 
proper organization of society." 

It is apparent then that simplistic 
repons of popular approval for capital 
punishment must not be construed as a 
result of rational individual evaluation 

and should have little bearing on policy 
decisions. 

Hence, capital punishment appears to 
be an extremely costly practice with 
little demonstrable benefit for society 
other than some sort of irrational 
emotional appeal. Many countries have 
already recognized this; indeed, the only 
major industrial nations which continue 
to use the death pehalty are the United 
States, South Africa and Russia. 

Hopefully, as "lime brings into 
existence new conditions and 
purposes ," and "public opinion becomes 
enlightened by a humane justice." we 
may see the end of this C"lel, unusual 
and fruitless punishment.

Alexander attempts 
Regent position 
By GRACE NIELSEN 

Some people can't tum down a 
challenge. Maty Rose Alexander is one 
of them. 

Alexander, a Muir junior, was a recent 
finalist among the nominees for the 
position of Student Regent for 1984-85. 
Each year, one student is selected [0 
serve a one-year tenn as a full voting 
member of the Board of Regems, which 
is the governing body of the University 
of Califomia system. 

-I'm the type that loves a challenge,-
said Alexander. So when the 
applications for the Student Regent 
pOSition became available, during fall 
quarter, she was among the first [0 
apply. 

The screening and selection of 
candidates is a very involved and 
thorough process. Alexander knew that 
to survive the interviews, she needed to 
become informed on the major issues 
facing the University. Although she 
knew that doing this would require a lot 
of effoIt, Alexander said, "I feel the 
leaming process is not only through 
books, but through meeting people and 
getting involved , and the time it takes is 
wonh it." 

So she began talking to many 
students and members of the 
administration in order to tty to 
understand what the problems were and 
to form an opinion about how the 
Regents should deal with them. Wlthm 

a few weeks of submitting her 
application , she was scheduled for an 
interview. Alexander was ecstatic. 

The first hurdle was an informal 
luncheon followed by an individual 20-
minute interview with the regional 
nominating commission. The 
commission is composed of two 
representatives from each of the five 
Southern campuses: Irvine, Riverside, 
Los Angeles, Santa Barbara and San 
Diego. The commission chose Alexander 
as one of the five Southem DiVISion 
applicants sent to the second interview. 

At this point , only nine candidates 
remained. Each went before a 19-
member panel of the Student Body 
Presidents Council and the current 
Student Regent for an extensive half-
hour interview. The panel questioned 
the applicants mdlvidually about such 
complex issues as the retention rate of 
Affirmative Action students, in order [0 
evaluate the candidates's understanding 
of and opinion on the topic. 

Alexander was not one of the three 
flOalists the SBPC chose , but she's not 
disappOinted . -It felt good to get as far 
as I did ," she said. -I knew 1 had 
nothing to lose by going through the 
process, and I learned so much." 

Apparently, Alexander has good 
reason to be happy with her 
performance. According to two members 
of the SBPC who spoke with her later,

Mary Rose Alexander p/aad Jourth among candulaus Jor the '84- '85 Student Regent poSition. 

Alexander was founh among the 
finalists. ThaI says something about the 
impression Alexander made on the 
review committees, such as the SBPC. 
that many of the other candidates had. 

The experience of applying for the 
position of Student Regent has 
reinforced her opinion that it is very 
important for students to become 
infonned about the issues that affect 
them and about how the University 
system operates. Alexander encourages 
3tudents to "go through the leaming 
process as I did." 

Also, more than ever, Alexander 
believes the Student Regent position is 

important because it is the only 
representation the collective 
undergraduate and graduate student 
body of all the UC camruses has 
directly on the Board 0 Regents. 

-I really had my mind set on it," she 
said, -and now I know it is possible to 
become a Regent and to take pan in the 
decisions that affect the students." 

This year's Student Regent is UCLA 
graduate student Fred Gaines. But you 
can count on one thing - when his 
term is up , Mary Rose Alexander will be 
ready. 

Some people just can't tum down a 
challenge.

Davis up to this time. The 
administration, led by Chancellor 
McGill, was cautious. McGill approved 
many of the principles underlying the 
proposals but refused to endorse them 
because they were written in 
inflammatory language. 

Negotiations continued for several 
weeks. BSC-MAYA representatives. who 
had negOliated with the understanding 
that Senate approval of the results of the 
negotiations would be a formality, were 
angered to find the Senate debating 
endlessly about the college. 

To break the deadlock, Angela Davis 
led the most militant action in the 
h ismI)' of UCSD - occupation of the 
Registrar's office. The action was raken 
by 52 students and lasted about 80 
minutes. "We were serious, and we 
knew that we ran some risks ." Davis 
said . "I was almost expelled and my 
educational career was impOrtant to me. 

But it was also extremely important to 
assure that as many people who have so 
long been denied the right to education 
- it was important to assure that in 
future years those opponunities would 
be widened." 

Informed of the action. the Academic 
Senate moved to consider several 
resolutions on the floor. It passed the 
Veron resolution. which called for a new 
negotiating commiuee to be set up with 
members favorable to the principles 
underlying Lumumba-Zapata College. 

Angela Davis left UCSD the next fall 
to teach at UClA She was hounded for 
her radicalism by the then-governor, 
Ronald Reagan. and the UC Board of 
Regents. After her opening lecture at 
Royce Hall at UCLA, a graduate student 
and reponed FBI agent wrote a letter to 
the campus newspaper denouncing her 
as a member of the communist pany. 

A month before. the UC Regents 
adopted a resolution that "no political 
test shall ever be considered in the 
appointment and promOlion of any 
faculty member." But, under pressure 
from Gov. Reagan, the regents cited a 
policy dating to 19iO against hiring 
members of the Community Pany and 
directed UClA chancellor Charles 
Young to investigate Davis. Young 
commented. "The firing of Angela Davis 
will cause a row that will make the 
loyaity-oath fight look like a Sunday-
school picnic." Thus began Davis' next 
crusade for academic freedom. 

With the departure of Angela Davis 
from UCSD, the fires of radicalism lost 
their fury, The BSC-MAYA negotiated 
lesser demands with the Academic 
Senate, and students selected the name 
Third College over Lumumba-Zapata. 

But the fires are beginning to burn 
again. As Angela Davis said in her 1980 

On February 24. 1984, from 4 pm to 7 pm in Peterson HaD. room lOb, students . 
faculty and staff will gather to meet. exchange views on Black male-female 
relationships and discuss strategies for building a sense of community among Black 
students at UCSD. 

Dr. Danny Scarborough, a professor of literature in the Afro-American Studies 
Deparunent at San Diego State University. and Director of the SDSU Black Repenory 
Total Theatrical Experience. has been invited to discuss how Black male-female 
relationships are depicted in African-American literature. Two members of his 
company. Steve and Ava Beard . will . through dance. convey the essence of relating. 

This multi-media approach is one of several programs being planned as a pan of re -
initiating the Campus Black Forum. Campus Blac k Forum will meet on a weekly basis 

Black students will 
hold forum Friday 

to address issues and concerns of Black students that are academic as well as social in 
content. 

In 1983. Dr. Jacqueline Aeming did a national research study on the "Impact of 
College Environments on Black Students." In her study, she highlights three fac tors 
that can significantly influence a student's motivation to achieve academic 
excellence: networking and making friends; joining in extracurricular activities; and 
making academic progress between freshman and senior year. 

Dr. Phil Raphae~' Dr. RocheU Bastien, TemiDe Poner and Bob Irvin are coordinating 
this special event. and view the Campus Black Forum as a vehicle of social/ emOlional 
networking to improve the quality of life for Black students on campus. as weD as the 
surrounding Black community at large.

important responsibility resting with us

became involved in the coOege -

the legacy of struggle out of which the 
idea of Lumumba-Zapata was born."

Non-registrants may 
be denied state aid 
By JACKIE AFFONSO 
Sacramento Cormpondcnt 

State financial aid would be denied to 
postsecondary students not registered 
with the US Military Selective Service 
under legislation modeled after the 
Federal Solomon Amendment. 

Assembly BiU 2570, introduced by 
Assemblymember Frank Hill (R-Los 
Angeles) January 3 I, would prohibit the 

tudent Aid CommiSSion or any public 
or private postsecondary educational 
Insritlltion from administering finanCial 
aid to applicants who fail to register 
with the Selective Service. 

Under the Solomon Amendment, .. 
which became effective June 1983, 
students not registered for the draft are 
not eligible for federal financial aid . 
However. the constitutionality of the law 
is now being debated in the US 

Irons 
conllnued from page 3 

He compared the ties between the 
ethnic Japanese and Imperial Japan to 
the Iranian dissidence in the United 
tates during the hostage sltuatlon. Both 

were periods of national crisis and 
Involved anger directed toward a 
country and its people . 

Masugi admined that the motives of 
the internment may be racist, but 
added , "What does that tell us about 
what we should do now?" 

If an education foundation is granted , 
as the commission requested , Masugi is 
concerned that the scholarships given 
will be based solely on race. "It may do 
as much to inflame racism as to 
discourage it." 

"It was not a mIlitary neceSSity to 
intern the Japanese-Americans," 
exclaimed professor Irons. "There were 
never any instances of Japanese-
American espionage or sabotage ." 

Irons argued that the internment was 
based on racist anitudes that existed at 
the time. Because the Japanese were 
such successful farmers , the white 
farmers, and subsequently the local 

Supreme Coun. 
Hill introduced the bill because he 

thought it "objectionable" that students 
who did not register with the selective 
service were continuing to receive state 
funds , Cindy Judy, administrative aid to 
Hill, said. 

"If lhey fail 10 comply with federal 
law, they shouldn't be looking to the 
state for assistance: Judy said , 
reiterating Hill's sentiment. 

The effect of the legislation on 
University students IS questionable. Lois 
McNally, public information officer for 
the Student Aid Commission, said the 
majority of financial aid funding comes 
from federal, not state, funds . Also, she 
said most students apply for a 
combination of finanCial aid programs 

politicians wanted to get them out of 
California. This suppOrt aUowed West 
Coast militaty commander General J.L. 
Dewitt to do exactly that. 

"There IS no support under our legal 
system for a theory of collective or racial 
guilt ," Irons said . About the government 
officials who carried out Ihe internment, 
mcludlllg President Roosevelt, he stated , 
"We can understand them, but we don't 
have to forigve them for what they did ." 

While Masugl felt that the president 
Â· should have the force and power to do 
what has to be done" in times of war, 
Irons stated that constitutional rights 
must prevail "equally in times of war 
and peace." 

One of those in the audience was 
Katherine Kumamoto, who had been 
forcibly evacuated from her home in 
Mission Beach during the war. She was 
only in high school. 

"It damaged you in the sense that you 
felt that you weren't an American. You 
felt hurt and inferior." 

About Dr. Masugi , she replied, "He 
doesn't know. He wasn't there ."

and "would be likely to be complying to 
the law already." 

In addition, the University is, and will 
continue, supplementing state and 
federal financial aid awards given to 
students with its own funds, Marilyn 
Jaeger, UC director of financial aid, 
said. The University has complied wuh 
the Solomon Amendment, but has not 
made any policy changes other than 
requinng students to sign draft 
"co mpliance statements." she said. 

Although the University does not 
have documented information on the 
number of students denied federal aid 
because of refUSing to register, Jaeger 
said the number is small. ''Very, very few 
students have refused to sign the 
compliance statement," said Jaeger. 

The UC Student LDbby has ranked 
opposition to this bill as its "first 
priority," Ron Balestrieri , lobby director, 

said . The lobby is now conducting an 
"all OUt" lobby campaign, consisting of 
phone caDs, lener wnting and personal 
meetings with legislators. 

While the University has not taken 
an olTicial position on the bill , it is 
opposed to the idea, Steve Arditti, UC 
director of state governmental relations, 
said . 

Arditti said the University does ,not 
feel that denying aid to students is part 
of its educational dUlles. He said the 
present law is "inequitable" because it 
serves as an added penalty to a select 
body of students. 

"This notion has relevance only to 
low-income students," he said. 

The bill, sponsored by both 
Democrats and Republicans and co-
authored by four Republican senators, is 
scheduled to be heard in the Assembly 
Education Committee in March.

Triton high ends with hangover 
By MIKE GREENBERG 
SANTA BARBARA - If there was any 
doubt as to the validity of Westmont's 
number three ranking, it was dispeDed 
Tuesday night, as the Warriors soundly 
defeated UCSD 106-78, making 
tomorrow night's contest at Point LDma 
critical for the Tritons if they want the 
home court advantage in this year's 
playoffs. A win over the Crusaders and 
an Azusa Pacific victory Over Cal Baptist 
(who beat Point LDma on Tuesday, 
eliminating the Ianer from home coun 
consideration) would vault UCSD into 
the fourth spot in the NAlA playoff 
picture and assure that the March 3 first 
round would be played in the Pavilion. 

Yet, the Tritons bener concern 
themselves with what went wrong 
Tuesday. For the umpteenth time, UCSD 
came out Oat in the opening moments, 
and played catch up throughout, only to 
have its once-labeled "tenacious" 
defense be the downfall in their defeat. 

UCSD allowed more points in the 
second half (65) than it usuaUy gives up 
In a game. The somewhat awesome 
-freak" defense faltered, and head coach 
T om Marshall's proclamation that his 
team would upset Westmont by two 
points was in Jeopardy from the 
opening. tip. 

Backed by 1,000 subdued fans who, 
by now, are accustomed to their team 
winning by big numbers, Westmont 
scored the' game's first eight points. By 
halftime, it was 41-30, and what little 
hope the Tritons had in a second 
stanza comeback was quickly quashed 
four minutes after intermission. Marshall 
decided to put his team into a full coun 
press to change the tempo, but the ever-
opportunistic Warrior capitalized with 
an abundance of criSp passes that 
resulted in breaking that press for easy 
layups. UCSD scored enough points to 
win against almost any opponent, but 
Westmont docs not lead the conference 
in field goal shooting because' of an 
error by the league statistician. The 
Warriors shot 63% from the floor, while 
the Tritons threaded the nets at a 54% 
clip. But a 43% figure in the first half 
put UCSD in a hole that would get 
deeper as the night progressed. So 
instead of controlling their own destiny, 
MarshaU's lads have to rely on Azusa 
Pacific to upset Cal Baptist for UCSD to 
gain the home coun advantage, 
something the Triton head coach said is 
"a must" if the club is going to succeed 
in post-season action. One only has to 
look at the club's road record (1-6) to 
realize the importance of playing in the 
friendly confines of Triton Pavilion. 

Even in defeat, Marshall remains his 
ever-present optimistic self. But 
sometimes, the rookie coach exaggerates 
to the point of lunacy. "This loss was 
attributed more to how badly we played 
than how well they played," said 
Marshall, yesterday morning. "We can 
play with these guys on any given 
night.. .. If they are number three in the 
nation, then we should be ranked ." 

One might ask why the Tntons 
should even be considered for a 
natillnal ranking. Sure, they have played 
well of late (lour out 01 six wins). but 
thclr overall record IS 10- 16. Compare 
that With Westmont\ 2 }-2 and one can 
understand the ration,lle m aWJrdlng

Baptist - while falling to the only 
quality tearns they have faced -
Southern Cal College and Westmont. 
Granted, the Tritons have performed 
superbly in spurts this season (with the 
Spirit Night being the coup de grace), but 
the team's inconsistent play, especiaUy 
in the first halves raises a doubt as to 
whether UCSD will be playing after 
March 3. 

But the subject at hand is Point LDma, 
and they will cenainly be looking to 
avenge UCSD's Spirit Night triumph. On 
that night, the Crusaders were on top of 
the Southern Division at 4-1, three 
games in from of the Tritons. Three 
weeks later, Point Lorna is 5-7, tied with 
UCSD lOr founh in the division, three 
behind leader Southern Cal College. No 
one is quite sure, especiaDy head coach 
Ben Foster, what exacdy had happened 
to the Crusaders in their last seven 
contests. Picked as the favorites to win 
the division and possibly repeat as 
district champions, Point Loma has 

been the biggest disappointment in the 
conference this year.

Barecca has dominated the league's best

Severen was Bareeca's victim . These two 
bach-to-back performances add further 
credence to Marshall's claim lhat lhe Triton 
junior should make this year's aU-star 
leam .... Brandon Nixon played wtU, 
shooting 7-10 from the fitld and 4-4 from 
the charity stripe for 18 points. Nixon has 
now illustrated that he has completely

separation that ltept the Triton perennial 
all-star from playing 100%. Nixon's return 
has also helped freshman Greg Kamansl/y,

Spikers manage a game 
By USA lAPIN 

The UCSD men's volleybaD team did 
it again in Triton Pavilion, as they sem 
San Diego State home last night 
wondering what had hit them. The 
Tmons did the unheard of by taking the 
game from the fourth-ranked , Division 1 
Aztecs, as they eventually went on to 
lose in four . 

UCSD is in Division III and was not 
expected to score weD against SDSU, but 
they did, avenging their brutal loss three 
weeks ago to the Aztecs when the 
Tritons scored a total of four points in 
three games. San Diego State was not 
expecting improvement in UCSD's 
offense and was cocky at the outset, 
winning the first game 15-6. But after 
dropping the second game to the 
Tritons by a 15-7 coum, they knew they 

wert: up against a team that meant 
business. The Aztecs won the third 
game with minimal difficulty but had to 
fight bef.ore they took the fourth . The 
Triton fans who turned out for the evem 
were treated to some exciting voUeybaD 
in the process. 

"Earlier in the year we would have 
folded up our rents," said Triton coach 
Doug Dannevik, who was proud of the 
team effon. "We had a lead in the 
second game and we held it. We came 
back from point deficits in the other 
games." 

UCSD upheld a match-long tradition 
of Jumping out to an early lead. Hits by 
Mike Mitchell and Man Hunt gave the 
Triton spikers a 3-0 advantage j'n the 
first game, but missed serves and 

A FRESHMAN DUET - Matt Hunt and Geo~c Kmghts CDnvc~c on all SDSU '1'Ik~ 

Intense hits by State's John Eddo tied 
the game at three all. UCSD's John 
Henderson and Tad Braun had a 
mishap and coDided on the coun, 
enabling the Aztecs to grab a 6-4 lead, 
Not to be denied, the Tritons came right 
back as blockers Scott Criswell and Scon 
McGregor leaped for a point, to tie the 
contest at six. The Tritons took the lead 
7-6 as 6'1 * blocker John Henderson 
blasted a spike between the SDSU 
defenders. From there, the Tritons lost 
momentum by succumbing to errors and 
penalty caDs. With the Aztecs ahead 13-
6, Dannevik resorted to substitutions 
and was finally forced to call time out 
when the senior-dominated State team 
reached game poim. A clean rany by 
SDSU ended the game. The fun was 
about to begin for UCSD. 

The second game was UCSD's tum 
for glory as they opened with a kill by 
sophomore hitter Tad Braun. Two errors 
by the visitors and two "taps" off of the 
magic fingers of MitcheD gave the 
Tritons a four-point lead. 

Once again, the Aztecs' John Eddo 
dominated his side of the court, and 
several weU-contested rallies went 
SDSU's way to bring the score to five all. 
SDSU's Kevin Droke served the baD out, 
and a brilliant tap by George Knights 
gave UCSD a 6-5 lead. SDSU's numblfT 
one hiner, Mike Sagely, repeatedly 
brought the ball back to the Aztecs' side 
of the coun, but the visiting team was 
unable to take advantage of its 
opportunities as UCSD consistently 
forced th~ side out. AnOther tap by 
Mitchell had the fans on their feet, and 
a strong hit by Hunt, followed by 
another hit by the red-hot Mitchell, put 
UCSD ahead at 8-7. 
The Aztecs then made several blatant 
errors atypical of their top Division (status, 
With the score at 10-7, Aztec head coach 
Duncan McFarland called a umeout, but it 
had no viSible effect on his team's 
performance. After well-executed UCSD 
scmmbles, some clowning by Kevin 
Bateman on the servlOg court and hits by 
Braun and Henderson, the Tritons 
emerged vi torious, 15-7.

UCSD eyes third-ranked NAIA tea~ 
By MIKE GREENBERG 

Once in a blue moon. a great hilting 
team shows up at Olsen Field to playa 
baseball game. Unfortunately for the 
UCSD faithful . the above statement is 
usually reserved for their opponents. not 
the Tritons. Such will be the case today 
at 2:30 pm. as Grand Canyon College. 
the country's third-ranked team in the 
NAJA VIsits from Arizona to face UCSD 
in what should be the year's most 
entertaining contest. 

Since they have won the NAIA 
national championship three out of 
their last four campaigns and currently 
possess an unblemished record of 8-0. 
Triton Manager Lyle Yates is realisti\!' 
about his team's chances. "You'll 
probably see the best team in terms of 
offense . scoring runs and hitting the ball 
hard if you come out today." said Yates 
in a definite appeal for crowd suppOrt. 
"They can compete against any team in 
the nation. and that means the best 
teams in Division I." 

Besides being concerned with the 
Antelopes. UCSD's head coach must be 
worried about the possibility of fatigue 
today. SInce the ballclub traveled to 
Redlands yesterday (see SIdebar). 
Arriving in San Diego late last night. the 
Tritons must regroup in time to playa 
team that averages nine runs a game. 
Says Yates: "We should be tired. but 
playing Grand Canyon will pump us up. 
Besides. we have five guys who should 
be rested: The players Yates alluded to 
lire five starters who couldn 't make the 
trip due to study sessions in preparation 
'or this week's midterms. But the dub 
;hould be at full strength today as 

sophomore righthander Mark Sloan 
makes his second stan of the season . 

Sloan's last appearance was a superb 
one. as he combined with Eric Reynolds 
and Rob Case on a 3-hlt. 15 strikeout 
shutout over Cal Tech Saturday in the 
nightcap of a twin bill. The flrst game 
was also won by UCSD 13-1 as 
freshman Derrick A1konis went 3-5 with 
3 RBI's. 

There will be added incentive for 
UCSD against the Antelop.es since the 
dub dropped two very dose contests in 
the visitor's home state at the outset of 

the season . In that doubleheader. Grand 
Canyon crossed home plate 25 times 
and Yates doesn't see any reason for 
that trend to dlscontmue. "They will 
score runs today. What we have to do is 
play good defense and capitalize on our 
opportunities. We played them very 
tough in Arizona and actually had 
chances to win In both games. If we 
play good sound baseball , we could 
upset them. I'm expecting a great game." 

Scheduling such teams as Redlands 
and Grand Canyon (twice) is a crafty 
move by Yates. since the tough 

Redlands bats pound Tritons 
Following UCSD's doubleheader pounding of Cal Tech this past weekend 

(combined score: UCSD 30, Cal Tech 1). the Tritons found out what it was like to be 
on the short end of the scoreboard as the University of Redlands pounded them, 14-2 
yesterday. Head coach Lyle Yates summed up the performance of the Tmons on the 
afternoon when he stated, "We didn't play well offensively or defensively, and our 
pitching was terrible." 

Redlands jumped out to a 2-0 lead off Triton starter Mike Peterson in the flrston the 
strength of three singles and a pair of walks. The Bulldogs added four more in the third 
with a Single, a double, two more walks and two squeeze bunts. UCSD came back with 
a single run in the fourth as John Rosness, who went 3 for 4 on the day, drove inJohn 
Hickman. The Tritons closed to 6-2 when Don Petersen tripled in the seventh and 
Rosness drove him in. With the two runs batted in. Rosness raised his team-leading 
RBI total to 11. But in the boltom of the seventh, after Rob Case had replaced Kevin 
Illingworth on the mound for UCSD, Redlands extended a rude greeting to the Triton 
reliever by exploding for seven runs to ice the game. 

The Tritons slipped to 5-6 on the year, and will be hard-pressed to even their 
record today as they host the NAJA's third-ranked team. Grand Canyon College. at 
Olsen Field. 

. 

competition should prepare the dub 
adequately for its league opener, March 
10 at three-time defending champion 
Azusa Paciflc. Whether they do prevail 
today is not the issue, but rather how 
well they play. Losing to Gnmd Canyon, 
one of the best tearns in the United 
States and performing well does the 
Tritons a lot more good than beating up 
on lowly Cal Tech. Yates knows this all 
too well. as last year, the team entered 
the season unprepared for what was to 
follow an 11-32 season. 
Reading betMen the lines: UC5D's 
probable line up against the Antdopes will be 
the following: David 5tanovich, freshman 
deSignated hitter; Bob Natal, freshman 
righiflClder; John Hickman. junior second 
baseman; Derrick Allwnis,freshman catcher; 
Don Peterson. junior third basemen; John 
Rosness, junior .first basemen; Dan DiMascio. 
freshman leftfidder; Klaudio Biazevich. 
freshman shortstop; Chris 5tavros, freshman 
centerjlelder; Mark 5lqan, sophomore 
nghthandtd ptichtr .. .. Peterson made his 
second position switch of the young season. 
movingjrom leftJitld to third base. But J.lnlike 
before, when the junior was haYing fielding 
probltms at shortstop. prompting Yates to 
make the change to ltft. this time it was third 
basemen Dan DiMascio who was having 
difficulty. In a conlest last wuk. DiMascio 
committed four errors at the hot comer and 
Yates was forced to maltc hIS second roster 
alleralWn. But since the move, both players 
have performed well and it looks for now, as if 
these might be the pmnanent positions jQr

Ultimate: No slip of the disc 
By KRISTIN DONNAN 

The Mudsharks, the Sky Monsters, the 
Windjammers, Entropy - these were 
some of the panicipants In the Ultimate 
Frisbee tournament that was held at 
UCSD this past weekend . Twenty one 
teams came to the Wmter Crystal 
Tournament which was sponsored by 
Blacks Beach Ultimate Entropy, a team 
composed of UCSD students. 

Entrants from all over California and 
Arizona competed. but Southern 
California held tough. Two teams from 
Santa Barbara swept the men 's 
competition. and the San Diego 
Windjammers flew undefeated through 
the women's finals. 

What is Ultimate Frisbee? It is a field 
sport played with two teams of seven 
people each. The philosophy combines 
fQO(ball, soccer and basketball as the 
players try to advance the frisbee down 
the field into an end zone. 

The game functions via the honor 
system, as no officials are involved at aU. 

Paul "ChÂ«tah" Nishi41 provides somt htaI.y D. 

Kate Punnal. captain of Women's 
Entropy, explained that the difference 
be~en Ultimate and other sports is 
that there isn't even a coach. Â·Our 
COfChes are players also. By being good 
serious players, they show their teams 
what they want." 

The atmosphere at a frisbee 
tournament is unlike that of any other 
spon. This may be because the game 
was conceived only 16 years ago, 
according to Charlie Schmidt, an 
Entropy member. 

The game has spread from itS New 
Jersey birth place to countries aU over the 
world. Indeed, its popularity has led to 
an annual World Championship held in 
Santa Cruz each summer. 

Various players from the Winter 
Crystal Tournament explained why 
Ultimate is so popular. Michele 
Whitmore, a transplanted cross-country 
star, explained that "the combination of 
everything you do - running, jumping 
and hitting the ground - makes it 
unique in spons. There is both fine and

Cristina Castanha said , "A ball is 

predictable. but a disc is never 
predictable and you have to go ail out 
because there 's always a chance you can 
get it. Also, having no referees makes it 
a lot more honest than any other 
sports." 

When asked to identify the 
ingredientS that make a wumament 
successful, as this one was, players 
called out their ideas. Among them were 
good fields , sun. a positive spirit and 
playing against unfamiliar tearns who 
had traveled long distances. â€¢ 

Mary Gerk mentioned an integral 
ingredient: "I think it's a self-motivating 
spon that is definitely social. But the 
music is the key - it's the essence of 
Ultimate." 

Comaraderie and healthy attitudes are 
essential to a game that relies so heavily 
on each individual's sportsmanship.

SDSU made some substitutions. 

evenheless, the Triton players were 
proud of their accomplishment. "It was 
our first win against a Division I team. 
Winning that second game was like 
winning the emire match," said Criswell. 

The third game did not flow as 
smoothly for the Tritons. The offense 
was tense from the rather unexpected, 
yet well-earned win of the previous 
game. The Aztecs immediately exploded 
to a seven point lead. A fine hit by 
MItchell brought the ball back to the 
home team, but they couldn't put it 
away, and SD U continued to increase 

the advantage. With strong 
perfonnances from 6'4H Aztec senior 
middle blocker Pete NolJedorfs. DSU 
assumed a ten point bulge. 

A block by Knights and Cnswell 
finally put UCSD on the scoreboard. 
The Tritons then had to rally 'fot' 
anOlher side out, and MItchell , the 
crowd favorite for the night, tapped the 
ball down for another Triton point. 
Some errors by the visiting team brought 
the UCSD score to four, but by then 
SDSU had the game well in hand . To 
further thwart the Triton comeback, the 
referee was hit in the face by a serve, 
and SDSU got a side out. Despite good 
on-court passing by Henderson , the 
Aztecs gOl the ball back once more and 
cashed in to take a 2-1 game advantage. 

The final game of the match was a 
thriller, with SDSU rallying forcefully for 
the win. State jumped OUt to a 7-0 lead, 

but the Tritons would not easily 
surrender. After a hit by Mike ageJy 
gave the Aztecs a 9-1 lead , UC D came 
back on the strength of a Criswell block, 
two hits by Hum, and a blatant net by 
the Aztecs. UC5D closed to 9-4 and 
didn't stop there. An excellent diving 
save by UCSD's Eric Hallman brought 
UCSD to within two. Hits by Knights 
and Criswell cut the Aztec lead to a 
mere point, at 9-8, and a spectacular 
rally, which ended with another UCSD 
spike, tied the game at nine. 

After twO more challenging rallies, the 
Trirons surprised the Aztecs by pulling 
ahead to an 11-9 lead . But SDSU's 
domination finally surfaced as they won 
the next six poims to take the game lS-
I I and close out the match. Although it 
fell shon in the end , UCSD's remarkable 
comeback showed it could provide 
opposition. 

When JOO're in a tight spot, 
good &iends will help you out. 

When you pulled in two hours ago, you didn't 
have this problem. And with a party just starting, 
the last thing you wanted to do was 
wait around another two hours. 

Neither did the rest of the guys. 
So when they offered to give you 
a lift, that's exactly what they did, 
proving not only that they were 
in good shape, but that they 
were good friends . 

So show them what apprecia-
tion is all about. lonight, let it

"That's what we'd like to show people 
who come to watch us ," said the 
exuberant Dannevik after the match. 
"We're fun to walch . The players are 
young and will be around for a while." 

Although Dannevik admits that the 
Aztecs didn't playas well as they could 
have, the Triton performance was 
certainly something to be proud of." 

Mike Mitchell , who was-an incredible 
asset for the home team, explained why 
there is no comparison to the last game 
his team played against SDSU. "This was 
the first time we won the big point, and 
because of this, it earned us a game 
against a powerhouse." 

Said benchside rooter Doug Stanley, 
who came to UCSD after declining to 
continue a full scholarship with 
Northern Arizona University as 
quanerback, "The team played very well

High Fiddlry 

Rare look 
at Russian 
ballet in film 

By !'DIM rt:I:RST 
While the TU.shdance fad in 

1984 continues In IUms Uke 
footloose, a less dreamy 
exploitation of dance and the 
dancer can be found In the 
recently released documentary, 
IJIIclcstage at . the KiIOD. In 
attempting an Incisive look at 
the behind the scenes workings 
of this renowned, 200-year-old 
company during six weeks of 
rehearsal for Swan Lake, BrItish 
wrlter/dJJutor Derek Hart hu 
crated what amounts to little 
more than a good PBS 
documallary. 

The ftlm's babnent of this 
undeniably formidable RussIan 
compaay sulers, due to the fact 
that Hart Is bound to a 
traditional framework - he 
falters from too much respect 
for the ~t matter. In 
documenting rebearsals for 
swan Lake, the fUm Is forced to 
examine a ballet clusic - a 
ctusle that was In rac:t created 
on the KIrov stage In the 19th 
century. The messages here are 
r.m .... and redundlnt: dance Is 
dlmcult: Swan Lake Is a 
beautiful ballet: dancas MlI'k 
very hard. 

The nlm succeeds most when 
It shifts gem and starts looking 
at the danc:ers In this mm as 
people. One of Its more 
humorous moments occurs 
when the star ballerlnl talks of a 
young mID who made a pass at 
her In a market Other Iootage 
succeeds sImply by locating the 
nlm In tinle and spICe. We are 

mkenomof~landl~ 
the Soviet Union In 198.5. Hue It 

should be noted that the nlmlng 
of lJaclrstage It the Kirou was an 
UDprecedented event. It was the 
lint time Western camera crews 
were ever allowed behind the 
scenes of the KIrov. 

Thl5 transcendence of 
International and political 
boundaries that made the film 
possible is all but completely 
Ignored. CertaInly. the inYasKJn 
of westan camera cmn onto 
the stage of this Russian 
institution would disturb the 
workings of the company 

bureauaatically~. as well as 

disturb the normal functioning 
of Its rehearals. How do camera 
crews arfect a rigorous. 
disciplined ballet rehemal? 
How do Westall camera crews 
get Into the Sovtet Union In this 
day and age? Besides ftn<Iing a 
bard-wortdng. excellent ballet 
com.-ny. what Is It about 
RussIa that mikes this company 
dlffeRnt? 1bese questiOM are 
neitba IdcIft:Bd 'nor raised. 
Ultimately, the film 15 
completdy promotional -- an 
undaunted praise of the Kirov

There Is a challenge to 

outfttting one's film with stars. 
Star presence must be 
disciplined In order for It to 
work with the film 's 
development Some get great 
results. Nicolas Roeg manages 
to use David Bowie. occupation: 
rock star. for. not against. The 
Man Who fell to tarth . When 
star quality is not kept In check, 
however, the fUm as something 
other than star vehicle goes out 
the window. this brings us to 
Unfaithfully Yours. and Its 
merry band of stars, Dudley 
Moore , Nastassja KlnskL 

6 ffiiltus february n. 1984 

Armand Assank and Albert 
Brooks. 

The problem here Is the 
pursuit of comedy with a divide 
and counquer scheme. The 
director. Howard lleff. 
constantly cuts up situations In 
the film by focusing too much 
attention on individual actors. 
He puts the actor between the 
camera and the action. Or he 
places the object of the actor's 
attention In some Incon-
spicuous place on the screen. 
Or. more slgnlftcantly. he keeps 
his stars on screen by 
themselves. as If. In this story 
concerning a love triangle. 

Indlvtduals haft no relationship 
with one another. 

Someone mu. ha~ felt that 
the fllm's situations. 
consequences of the lead actor's 
jealousy concerning his young. 
beautiful wife. had some value. 
What has been produced here 
scarcely reflects such. The result 
of the divide and conquer 
scheme Is to leave any scene 
with Moore. Klnsld. Brooks or 
Assante pulled out of shape by 
the dlrectorÂ·s acquiescence to 
the star presence. 

The film's comedy Is hardest 
hit by the Iltrategy. The premise 
Is continually kept fi'om being 

funny. So not until the comedy 
can work within the star IIIOÂ¥eS 
does tile ftlm get funny. This 
doesnÂ·t happen until the dlmu, 
when Moore tries with a 
remarbble lack of success to 
IdJI his wife, Kloskl. Here, 
situations revolve around the 
single actor. like Moore trying 
to pulverize tranquilizers with a 
can of Coke and coughing to 
cover the sound. SUddenly 
situations work with. not 
against. Moore's physical 
comedy. And It Is pretty funny. 

The premise, when con-
sidered alone. does seem like It 
belongs on the late show,
