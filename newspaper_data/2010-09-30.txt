Last night, the Campus Affairs committee meeting unanimously passed a series of amendments to Triton Television’s charter, including broadcast regulations 
that limit what can be said on air. Of course, this isn’t the 
only change that TTV is undergoing.

Modeling itself after national television networks, 
TTV  has added numerous positions, such as Senior Vice 
President Production and Vice President Marketing; it now 

also has the ability to license its work beyond 
A.S. Council to student organizations, depart-
ments and even outside of UCSD.

The station is undergoing an unprecedent-
ed transformation. Rebranded as UCSD’s first 
pre-professional film and television station, 

TTV is a far cry from last year’s Student-Run Television. 
After last year drenched the name SRTV in a turbulent his-
tory that brought national media attention, Station Manager 
Thomas Dadourian said he is happy with the makeover. 

TTV is scheduled to receive a total of $11,000 a year 
for operating costs and a film initiative from A.S. Council, 
which will finalize the executive budget during Week 3.

Dadourian said he will request additional funds for 
necessary equipment, like a new server as well as a possible

Ever since the Grove Cafe closed its 
doors at the end of Spring Quarter, the 
University Centers Advisory Board has 
been searching for ways to fill the space. 

The newest plan, according to 
UCAB Chair Nicole Metildi, is to 
replace the cafe with a Mexican restau-
rant. One option is San Diego-based 
restaurant Porkyland, which special-
izes in pork-based entrees, though 
Porkyland is only one of many restau-
rants that could potentially replace the 
empty space. 

“The Mexican restaurant Porkyland 
is one that we are considering, but we 
haven’t looked at all the options yet,” 
Metildi said. 

The Grove Cafe shut down at the 
end of last year after failed attempts 
to revitalize the cafe and a $180,000 
debt. After A.S. Council voted at its last 
meeting to shut down the 24-year-old 
student-run café, ownership reverted 
back to the university and responsibil-
ity for the space fell into the hands of 
UCAB.

Decisions on how to fill the space 
have been on standstill due to sum-
mer break, but plans regarding which 
restaurant or vendor to bring to the 
Old Student Center will be finalized in 
the next month, UCAB director Paul 
Terzino said. 

“A taco shop is one of the many 
options we are considering about the 
future of the Grove,” Terzino said. “We 
have not finalized anything yet. The 
decision of choosing a vendor will 
hopefully be done in the next three to 
four weeks.”

After last year’s campus-wide swine flu outbreak — which affected more 
than 3,400 students — Student Health Services has stocked up on 6,000 vac-
cine shots in new efforts at preventing the H1N1 virus. 

“We are very prepared this year,” Deborah Pinot-Shaballett, Director of 
Health Education, said. “We have vaccines on campus already which are avail-
able for free for students with SHIP [Student Health Insurance Plan].”

Jill Ballard, Director of Clinical Services,0 said that the shipment of 
vaccines that came in last week will cover “about 20 percent of the campus 
population.”

Though the doses are not enough to protect the campus, statistics pro-

IncreasingÊBatteryÊLifeÊwithÊaÊNewÊSmartphoneÊChip
sCienCe AND teCHnoLogy

By Jerry To
Staff Writer

Smartphones — known for having 
a shorter battery life than standard 
mobile phones — may soon find them-
selves less reliant on a charger. Once 
UCSD professors and graduate stu-
dents are completing a hardware reno-
vation that would improve battery life.

The extra efficiency would come 
from typically unused transistors 
called “dark silicon.” Transistors are an 
integral part of computer chips as they 
can increase the power of the electrical 
signals that pass through them.

However, because they produce 
heat, the number of transistors that can 
be active in a computer chip is limited.

Several professors and graduate stu-
dents are developing a prototype mobile 
application processor called GreenDroid, 
which would reduce battery usage up to 
15 times by reclaiming dark silicon with-
out overheating the hardware.

“GreenDroid is a new mobile applica-
tion processor that we’re developing for 
Android smartphones,” computer sci-

ence graduate student Nathan Goulding 
said. “The idea is to use specialized 
hardware to save energy for common 
applications on Android phones.”

Since their initial integration into 
the world of computer engineering, 
the number of transistors that can be 
placed in a computer chip has risen 
exponentially, a phenomenon known 
as Moore’s Law. Although processing 
speed has enjoyed a few years of rapid 
growth from this addition, computer 
engineers have hit a wall. Utilizing all 
transistors at once is no longer feasible 
due to insufficient heat dissipation. 

“When you buy a new chip, you 
can only use a tiny percentage of it at 
once,” Goulding said.

Attempting to use all of the transis-
tors at once causes the chip to heat rap-
idly and, without sufficient ventilation, 
cause the hardware to melt.

“We’re running against something 
called the utilization wall,” Goulding 
said. “We can no longer use all of the 
transistors on a chip at once.”

The utilization wall prevents the 
chip from using too much power and 

overheating by limiting the amount 
of transistors being used. Dark sili-
con is the name for a transistor that 
remains unused because of the insuf-
ficient power available. A number of 
transistors that aren’t used remain inac-
tive, or “dark,” since it cannot be utilized 
without changing the chip. However, 
GreenDroid activates the dark silicon 
through a special purpose hardware 
known as conservation cores. 

“Conservation cores are specialized 
pieces of hardware that greatly reduce 
energy,” Goulding said. “Each core can 
perform one function, and it does so 
extremely efficiently.”

GreenDroid is currently specific 
to the Android platform due to its 
open-sourced nature, which allows the 
researchers to test their product at no 
additional cost. However, other hard-
ware — such as game devices or other 
smartphones — may be compatible 
with GreenDroid in the future.

“We’re starting with an Android 
prototype, but conservation cores can 
be applied to all sorts of hardware — 
including general purpose processors, 

game hardware or other smartphones,” 
Goulding said.

Preliminary tests estimate the bat-
tery life of Android devices to improve 
by 10 to 15 times their current life when 
the conservation cores are in place. Not 
only does battery life improve, but 
the phone can run more efficiently 
while maintaining a low temperature 
by using less processing power.

“We can actually use [dark silicon] 
for computations, and that’s how we 
save energy,” Goulding said.

NEWSÊ THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 30, 2010Ê THE UCSD GUARDIAN 3

A new year, a new council, a new agenda. Here I was on the first Wednesday of the 
year, sitting amongst a new council 
almost as excited as I was. 

As I glanced over the Order of 
Business, my heart made a little 
flutter of joy — it seemed that I 
would be out in time to catch my 
Wednesday night TV shows. 

Public input consisted of a pro-
motional talk 
from Triton 
Television, 
complete with a 
video depicting 
the mayhem of 
the All Campus 
Dance 2010.  

As the masses of inebriated 
students flashed across the screen, 
the lighthearted mood surround-
ing council this Wednesday night 
quickly spread.  

Warren College Senator Kevin 
Hoang gave a talk about coun-
cil unity while Marshall College 
Senator, Thao Pham drew atten-
tion to the new college banners that 
adorned the Marshall campus in cel-
ebration of its 40th anniversary. 

VP Finance Andrew Ang 
announced that the budget would 
be unveiled soon and VP External 
Affairs Michael Lam urged Council 
to get voter registration to their 
respective colleges.  

To rekindle our hopes of any 
sort of school spirit here at UCSD, 
Pauline Nuth, AVP Athletic 
Relations, announced that news 
1,500 students were present at the 
Welcome Week water polo event, 
at which our water polo team hap-
pened to win by a landslide. What a 
novel concept for a school— who’d 
have thought that the moral support 
and school spirit would help our 
teams?

Then Grant White introduced 
himself as the Student Affirmative 
Action Committee representative. 
Mac Zilber, Warren College Senator, 
gave a presentation regarding the 
underrepresentation of transfer 
students on Council. He teamed up 
with Transfer Senator Adam Powers 
to present council with a constitu-
tional amendment that would add 
an additional transfer senator, thus 

correcting the 
imbalanced rep-
resentation that 
became an issue 
with the increas-
ing number of 
admitted transfer 
students.  

A.S. President Wafa Ben Hassine 
announced that council would be 
extending their family within the 
upcoming with numerous new 
appointments taking place.  

AVP Diversity Affairs Alyssa 
Peace brought to attention the spray-
painted stencils that have sprung up 
around Peterson and Center Hall. 
These stencils, according to Peace, 
have caused several young women 
around campus to express concern 
regarding the disrespectful messages 
that the stencils bring. She urged 
council to stay on the lookout for 
any harmful material that could be 
circling around campus.  

As I looked down at the agenda, I 
saw that the list was dwindling. Soon 
enough, there would be nothing 
more to address. I wasn’t prepared 
for this shocking revelation. 

What would I do with this unex-
pected boon of a Wednesday night? 

After all, council members made 
it through roll call just before Geisel 
rang out, announcing the time at 
7 p.m. Here’s to hoping this will be 
repeated next week. Cheers, San 
Diego. I’m out.

Though the new restaurant will be 
housed in the same space —  under 
T-Shirt Factory in the Old Student 
Center — the new business will be free 
from its debt. The debt will become 
the financial burden of A.S. Council 
instead. According to Metildi, the new 
restaurant will differ from its predeces-
sor because it will not be student-run.

However, before the ex-coffee shop 
can be converted into a new restaurant, 
it must avoid the problems that led the 
café into heavy debt. 

Some of the problems that led to 
the Grove Cafe’s failure included the 

lack of visibility and competition with 
other restaurants on campus. To coun-
teract this, the new restaurant will be 
renovated and will provide services to 
students that other campus vendors do 
not, such as ethnic food.

Regardless of which restaurant 
fills the space, it must suit and con-
tribute to the atmosphere of the Old 
Student Center, A.S. President Wafa 
Ben Hassine said. 

“[The new business] will be one 
that matches with the culture in that 
area and flows with the rest of the 
environment,” Hassine said.

Metildi stressed that UCAB is looking 

for a unique alternative to fill the space. 
“We want something that we don’t 

have on campus and can compete with 
other restaurants on campus,” Metildi 
said. “We will also change the space to 
make it more inviting to students.”

Construction and renovation will 
likely begin next summer to allow for 
the restaurant to open its doors dur-
ing Fall Quarter 2011. Decisions on 
whether to incorporate Triton Cash 
into the new restaurant will be decided 
within the next couple months.

adviser.
Additional amendments to 

the charter include new broadcast 
rules and regulations, one of which 
relies on the Society of Professional 
Journalists’ Code of Ethics to avoid 
stereotyping material that maligns or 
libels individuals.

“The charter wasn’t complete 
enough, to where we wanted it, and 
we didn’t want there to be any unsure 
wording, so we wanted to tighten it 
up,” Associate Vice President Student 
Services Meredith Madnick said. 
“There’s a standard of what can and 
what cannot be aired and what will 
happen if anything happens that’s not 
according to the charter.”

Madnick said her office looked at 
other universities’ television stations 
and found this definition to be the best.

Additional amendments to the 
charter include licensing copyrighted 
material and shows, which must fol-
low the charter’s broadcast rules and 
regulations and campus policies.

Two new divisions are scheduled 
for amendment in the charter. Triton 
News Network will report events on 
campus while Triton Artists Guild 
will be a place for actors to post their 
profiles so that production staff can 
use it as a way to hire people.

“TTV’s been doing some work 
with outside shows. To get those to 
air, we have to make some licens-
ing agreements and put them in the 
charter to clear up any wording,” 
Madnick said.

Dadourian stressed that the sta-
tion is concerned with production, 
not the new charter. 

 “Right now, we’re trying to bite off 
more than we can chew,” Dadourian 
said. “The only way we’re going to be 
able to do this is in a way that is both 
effective and organized. 

The station is currently in pre-

production for “The Power Behind 
Closed Doors,” a weekly half-hour 
show that will air on Time Warner 
La Jolla that features Dadourian, 
ex-White House official and pro-
ducer Pasquale Augustine and Time 
Warner Producer Jessica Elford. 
The show will look at how UCSD 
functions and how its community 
can get involved by interviewing 
local leaders about research, govern-
ment affairs and current events. The 
primetime show, which consists of 52 
episodes, is expected to air through-
out the 10-campus UC system in 
October.

The newest amendments to the 
charter are small but significant 
updates to an already edited ver-
sion that passed in March, after the 
station’s February shutdown for a 
racially controversial live broadcast 
of Koala TV.

“I can understand that [A.S.] 
does not want a repeat of SRTV,” 
Dadourian said. “Because they’re the 
ones giving us the money to be able 
to do what we love to do. We’re here 
to perfect our craft. That’s why we’re 
pre-professional.”

The major changes in the March 
charter included changing the station 
name from Student-Run Television 
to Triton Television and a ban on live 
programming — with the exception 
of the FallFest and Sun God festivals.

“There’s things that we felt needed 
to be added from last year, just to 
close any loopholes that may have 
been in the charter and make sure 
everything’s up to date in accordance 
with what we want to do with TTV— 
because they’re going to be doing a 
lot of great things this year,” Madnick 
said.

vided by the Center for Disease 
Control show that while one-third 
of Americans receive flu vaccines, 
only 20 percent of Americans actu-
ally contract the flu. 

Based on these statistics, the 
SHS has taken the upper bound by 
almost doubling the number of vac-
cines available last year. 

“Last year, the county public 
health ran out of swine flu vac-
cines, so we didn’t get our supply 
until Thanksgiving,” Ballard said. 
“By that time, the demand wasn’t 
there anymore so only 3,400 H1N1 
vaccines and 800 seasonal flu vac-
cines were given.” 

This year, scientists devel-
oped a flu vaccine that covers the 
H1N1 swine flu strain as well as 
two seasonal flu strains, H3N2 and 
Influenza B. 

This vaccine will provide  cover-
age against all three types of influen-
za and reduce the risk of contracting 
a different flu strain, as it is more 
comprehensive. 

In a video interview posted on 
UCSD’s flu prevention website, 

Dr. Rady Taplitz, clinical director 
for infectious disease at the UCSD 
Medical Center, explained the dif-
ference between the H1N1 flu and 
seasonal influenza strains. 

“Swine flu is an Influenza A virus 
and is related to human influenza,” 
Taplitz said. “One of the features 
that makes it of concern is that it is a 
novel influenza to the human popu-
lation. That means that the human 
population has not been exposed 
to this virus before and, therefore, 
no one essentially has immunity to 
this virus.” 

Like last year, students will have 
a choice between the nasal spray 
vaccine and the injection. 

The nasal spray vaccine contains 
a weak, diluted live virus and does 
not involve needles, though it is 
ineffective for people with respira-
tory problems or immune deficien-
cies.  

SHS is also following the CDC 
suggestions on how to ensure effec-
tive disease control. 

“CDC has advised everyone 
above the age of six months to be 
vaccinated against the swine flu, 

which is everyone on campus,” 
Ballard said. “Public health officials 
are still very concerned about the 
swine flu.”

In addition to preventative mea-
sures such as stocking up on vac-
cines, SHS has also established mea-
sures to deal with a flu outbreak. 

This includes get-well kits that 
include a digital thermometer, non-
aspirin fever reducers and cough 
syrup. 

SHS is also continuing with last 
year’s Flu Buddies program, which 
will allow students to stay at home if 
they are sick. 

“If a student is sick, arrange-
ments can be made where a Flu 
Buddy can pick up medicine, food 
and drinks for the student,” Pinot-
Shaballett said. 

Flu vaccines will be available 
starting Monday, Oct. 4, and are 
scheduled on a walk-in basis. 

The vaccines are free for 
students with SHIP and $15 
for those who waived SHIP.

As an artist I release shock videos 
and beat poetry over the Internet 
about human suffering and the ills 
of society and governmental brain-

my eccentric taste in fashion, bubbly 
personality and sensual avant-garde 
shock videos on YouTube. I am often

Swedish Sapphire, but underneath 
it all, I remain true to my academ-

Last winter, I applied to be a

myself fit for the position, having  
held numerous leadership positions 
at Muir College. I was crushed when 
I received a rejection letter. However,

YouTube, art, and lifestyle choices. I 
agreed to her requests and looking 
back, I cant believe I ever agreed to 
censoring myself. 

Spring training commenced and 
I was chosen to be be the HA for 
LGBT-Interest Housing. The waters 

began to get fishy after several spring 
trainings when I was approached by 
both Pat D.A. and Ebonie Rayford, 
the other Assistant Res Dean, 
questioning how my Facebook was 
looking or asking about my cur-
rent profile picture. It seemed to me 
they were solely concerned with the 
provocative clothing in my profile 
pictures, as those would not be seen 
as representative of Muir College, 
whose motto, ironically enough, 
is Celebrating the Independent 
Spirit. The sole purpose of those 
photos were to make statements on 
femininity and question the strict 
binary rules on the clothing men 
and women wear. I changed my 
Facebook profile picture and made it 
private. I felt singled out, because the 
Res Deans took advantage of the fact 
that they were friends with me on 
Facebook and not friends with half 
of the other HAs on staff. 

Finally summer came and San 
Diego Gay Pride was right around 
the corner. I met with my friend 
and mentor Sonia and asked what I 
should wear. I really wanted to wear 
some booty shorts and fairy wings 
so I could be as proud as possible 
of my queerness. Sonia unexpect-
edly mentioned that I was now a 
representative of Muir College and 
should watch my attire for Gay 
Pride. Censoring myself on Gay 
Pride sounded monotonous and I 

ignored her request and wore my 
booty shorts and fairy wings during 
the parade. The day after SD Pride 
Weekend, I received a text message 
from Pat D.A. asking for a meet-
ing with her in her office the next 
day. The meeting consisted of Pat 
D.A., Sonia Rosado, and the Dean of 
Student Affairs Patty Mahaffery told 
me,We feel your personal lifestyle 
and identity do not match up with 
the House Advising position here 
at Muir Collegewe are going to 
ask you to either resign from your 
position or we will have to be forced 
to terminate you. I was shocked. 
I cried. She explained that a con-
cerned peer emailed them about a 
YouTube video and a cocaine joke 
that was made on my Facebook 
which made me inappropriate for 
the position. Pat D.A. was not sym-
pathetic and explained I had two 
days to decide whether I wanted to 
resign or be terminated. Through the 
tears and anger I contacted Student 
Legal Services, Ombuds Office, the 
LGBT Resource Center and ACLU. 

Two days later I had my second 
meeting with Pat D.A. as well as 
Shaun Travers, the Campus Diversity 
Officer and Director of the LGBT 
Resource Center. Pat D.A. explained 
her reasons for terminating me 
again, yet if Muir College is truly all 
about Celebrating the Independent 
Spirit why were they denying me 

mine? Pat D.A. apologized but still 
held firm to her beliefs that my 
YouTube videos were inappropriate 
if the parents of the residents viewed 
them. She saw them as drug-promo-
tional videos  which was never my 
intent.  She had to maintain an image 
on her House Advising Staff and I 
guess a shock artist is not a part of 
her cookie-cutter image. I still cannot 
help but feel toyed with, singled out 
and taken advantage of throughout 
trainings. 

I could understand where she 
was coming from despite my anger 
and tears. I do not want to burn 
bridges with the Res Deans and Muir 
College. I am against censorship and 
fully believe in voicing ones opinions 
and Celebrating the Independent 
Spirit. I needed to tell my story 
because all artists should know 
that censorship is never acceptable. 
Ignore negative comments people 
say and do not stand for judgment. I 
learned that the hard way, but despite 
all the drama and tears I believe 
everything happens for a reason and 
the injustice I faced opened new 
doors for me this year. I am now 
a principal member of LGBTQIA 
and have more time to explore new 
opportunities. I have a plethora of 
interests and sometimes they clash. 
Despite my minor speed bump with 
Muir Res Life, it has only made me a 
stronger and more inspired artist.

Pantsuits

I have a confession. I am a huge 
Hillary Clinton fan. However, I 
know that no one is perfect, and that 
includes Bills better half.

Honey, you need a makeover. 

I usually dont agree with Peoples 
Best and Worst Dressed list, but when 
Clinton made it onto the 2010 lineup, I 
had to agree. 

Weve seen snapshots of her at ral-
lies and conventions. Its always the 
same pantsuit, but in a strange new 
color  one for every crayon in the 
box, and then some. Even Im embar-
rassed for her. 

One of my most humiliating fan 
moments was during her speech 
at the 2008 Democratic National 
Convention. While I sat in front of 
the TV awaiting yet another brilliant 
speech about unity in the Democratic 
Party, out steps my hero  in a 
mustard-orange pantsuit. I froze in 
horror, amid howling laughter from 
my Obama-crazed friends. 

Despite my disapproval of Clintons 
unshapely and unflattering rainbow 
of pantsuits, I understand her odd 
affinity toward them. Although its 
tempting to believe were in a forward-
thinking society, thats not the case. 
Men still outnumber women in the 
highest management positions; men 
still dominate the government; men 
are still getting the fatter paycheck.

When Clinton refused a shoot with 
Vogue for fear of looking too femi-
nine, the fashion community fought 
back. Editor in Chief Anna Wintour 
wrote, The notion that a contempo-
rary woman must look masculine in 
order to be taken seriously as a seeker 
of power is frankly dismaying.

Michelle Obama pulls off a femi-
nine flair. Her professional yet flatter-
ing outfits command respect. 

However, Clinton plays a different 
game than Obama. Although they 
both fill important political positions, 
the image of a First Lady is a far cry 
from that of a president. She largely 
serves as a family-friendly figurehead 
 present at events and charities to 
support her husband  instead of dis-
cussing trade deals with foreign digni-
taries or addressing congress. 

It wasnt that long ago that it was 
taboo for women to wear pantsuits. 
The few women who entered profes-
sional careers had no choice but to 
wear skirts and heels. Yet the strange 
polar shift from skirts and heels to 
pantsuits is merely fitting another set 
of skewed expectations from the male-
dominate world. Dressing down and 
hiding our femininity in order to be 
respected and taken seriously is not 
huge progress.

Women in power should have 
the freedom to express themselves by 
looking fly without seeming soft or 
weak, but that day is not today. The 
glass ceiling hasnt been broken. Look 
how much respect Sarah Palin gets in 
her skirts and heels (though she obvi-
ously has other factors working against 
her). Women still have to look the part 
to play the part.

Still  while I wouldnt suggest 
Clinton show up to her next press con-
ference in a floral frock, maybe a more 
fitted pantsuit would help. If nothing 
more, is it too much to ask that it not 
be mustard orange?

ANQI CHEN

There may be no such thing as bad publicity, but 
Triton Television has finally figured out the upside of 
a little good PR.

With the name of Student-Run Television noth-
ing but a distasteful memory, TTV is wholly embrac-
ing their new status on the A.S. Council bandwagon. 
Theyre so into their image of legitimacy, in fact, that 
although the council worked out a hefty list of what 
not to air into TTVs charter last night, Station 
Manager Tom Dadourian couldnt care less.

This lighthearted reception of a set of rules 
that could set other media orgs to rioting (there is 
a clause that obligates TTV to avoid stereotyping 
by race, gender, age, religion, ethnicity, geography, 
sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance 
or social status  enough to put a serious thorn in 
any satirical publications side) is probably due to the 
stations unprecedented commercial success since its 
reincarnation.

Having reclassified themselves as an A.S. service 

and not a media org, theyre quite content to be 
working for The Man  and rightfully so. Unlike the 
rest of the campus orgs starving for A.S. funds, TTV 
is sitting pretty with more contracts and financial 
backing than they know what to do with. 

Remember that diversity video, titled Triton 
Voices, that A.S. Council played during Welcome 
Week? Well, probably not. It was a 13-minute film 
featuring footage from last springs BSU protests and 
students and faculty from diverse backgrounds that 
was supposed to represent how diverse UCSD truly 
is. For that little number, TTV raked in $5,500 from 
Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Gary Ratcliff.

TTV is also contracting out film coverage to uni-
versity departments and sponsors  and charging a 
pretty penny for the privilege. The stations members 
dont directly financially benefit from their produc-
tions, but they do charge clients $120 for production, 
$35 pre-production and $65 for post-production

OPINIONÊ THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 30, 2010Ê THE UCSD GUARDIAN 5 

DRAWING FIRE By Johan De La Torre LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Dear Editor,
I am writing in regards to a let-

ter to the editor in the most recent 
issue of the Guardian entitled 
“UCSD Should Prioritize the 
Social Scene.” To the freshman at 
Marshall College, whose name it 
is not necessary to repeat in this 
letter (check the last issue), I have 
a couple of things to enlighten you 
about.

Firstly, I apologize that your life 
back in NorCal was so mundane 
and uneventful that you had to fan-
tasize about coming to UCSD and 
taking drunken photos of friends 
“humping the Triton Statue.” 
Obviously you didn’t get the memo 
that UCSD prioritizes research and 
education (the recent student fee 
increases are an obvious indication 
of that).

As a second-year, I value my 
education here at UCSD and always 
attempt to take a role in the “social 
scene,“ as you call it. While I may 
not wake up next to a complete 
stranger after a night of drinking, I 
do partake in the parts of campus 
life that foster friendship, commu-
nity and other aspects of campus 
life that involve more than sitting 
in my room alone with a bottle of 
alcohol. Admittedly, while UCSD 
is not as STD-ridden as SDSU and 
as full as intoxicated students who 
can handle more than one beer, not 
everyone here shares your distaste 
for college life.

Unfortunately, UCSD has not 
lived up to your social standards 
and for that you have yourself to 

blame. Seeing as you so “unknow-
ingly” accepted coming to a place 
that falls so far below your social 
standards is a clear indication that 
you will go far in life. In fact, why 
even come to college? I’m sure 
staying back in NorCal and day-
dreaming about parties and getting 
shit-faced will suffice. Or perhaps 
actually doing those things would 
better suit you.

However, I do commend you 
on your ability to be so observant 
and obviously so bored/distressed/ 
and perturbed as to write a letter to 
the editor of the Guardian in your 
first week here. I suggest you stop 
pulling a Holden Caulfield and do 
something about your social life 
here at UCSD. 

And on a last note, while your 
vivid and descriptive depictions 
of college life show that you have 
some promise and imagination, 
I suggest that next time, before 
submitting a letter to the editor, 
that you press spell check. I hope 
that helps and I wish you the best 
of luck in your first year here at 
UCSD. 

 —Elizabeth Garcia
Sophomore, Muir  College

work. It’s nice to know there’s at least 
one university org that’s making bank.

While “Triton Voices” may have 
had an audience consisting entirely 
of those wide-eyed freshmen that 
show up eagerly to every  Welcome 
Week event — and it could hardly 
have held even their enthusiastic 
attention for long,  some of the other 
videos that emerge from the studio are 
pretty impressive. Their reel of the All-
Campus Dance made the lackluster 
affair look almost EDC-worthy.

The flashing lights, cool angles 
and special effects should be enough 
to give it away, but just in case: This 
is not SRTV. The days of SRTV’s live 
talk shows and Koala TV are now only 
stuff of legend and PR nightmares.

It would be one thing if there was 
anything to censor. However, TTV 
members haven’t shown interest in 
producing shows with comedy or 
social commentary. Instead they’ve 
stuck to commissioned PR pieces — 
nothing groundbreaking, it’s true, 

and certainly nothing that will guar-
antee Koala levels of outraged pub-
licity, but who says they need to be 
controversial, outspoken and risqué 
to be successful? 

The latest issue of the Koala proved 
that just because you’re uncensored 
doesn’t mean you’re funny — or even 
remotely clever. It would be one thing 
if there were creative, cutting-edge 
comedians that wanted to push the 
line, but when there aren’t, insisting on 
controversy for the sake of being con-
troversial is just desperate.

After last year’s Koala TV debacle 
— in which Koala Editor in Chief 
Kris Gregorian infamously called 
the Black Student Union “ungrate-
ful niggers,” earning the Koala and 
then-SRTV alike a protest’s worth 
of enemies — TTV has turned over 
a new leaf. SRTV got its start as 
a television channel made for the 
students, by the students. However, 
after SRTV lost its charter and its 
name last spring, it became Triton 
Television: a channel by the students 

for the A.S. Council. And working 
as A.S. Council’s right-hand flunky 
might not be such a bad thing for 
TTV.

TTV classifies themselves as a pre-
professional business with members 
that genuinely want to enter the film 
industry. They’re not interested in cre-
ating scandal or starting riots — their 
newfound goal is to have their work 
reflect that of professionals and give 
their members experience.

TTV is raking in the dough from 
A.S. Council and big name sponsors 
like Red Bull, Amped and Truck 
Covers USA, all while producing 
quality work. Gold star for you, TTV.

If anything, TTV is proof that 
choosing the path of most resis-
tance isn’t always the best way to get 
ahead. While it might not be as edgy 
or badass — and it definitely isn’t for 
everyone — cooperation does work. 
And when you’re looking at four-
figure paychecks, it’s hard to remem-
ber why you wanted to call people 
names .in the first place.

Dreaming 
T he city of Boston is having a moment — a giant, old school Hollywood, ready-for-my-close-up moment. Pay 
attention. 

If anybody out there in La Jolla Land 
hasn’t seen “The Town” yet, you should 
run right over to the local AMC, because 

come Oscar season you’ll be sorry you 
missed it. Directed by Ben Affleck, “The 
Town” is just the latest in a string of grit-
ty hard-knock tales of Boston’s criminal 
underbelly, keeping company with gems 
like “Mystic River,” “Gone Baby Gone” 
(Affleck’s first directing gig) and “The 
Departed.” 

So why should you care, my little 
California-born ruffians? Because these 
movies (in addition to all of the Boston-
centric novels of Dennis Lehane) have 
begun to capture the public’s imagination 
in a manner little seen in today’s tiny 
google-able world. 

In case you’ve forgotten, all of the 
aforementioned films were Oscar-
nominated, and “The Departed” swept 
up four wins, including the coveted Best 
Picture. 

This trend comes as no surprise; since 
“The Sopranos” ended and Scorsese has 
taken to filming Leonardo DiCaprio play 
detective instead of crafting epic gangster 
dramas, Hollywood has been in need of 
a new kind of crime flick. It isn’t about 
New York Italians anymore. Boston’s 
unique history has made the tides shift to 
a whole new kind of “family.”

Growing up on the West Coast, 
Boston was just a city on a map to me, 
while places like New York were divided 
colorfully in my mind into Brooklyn and 
Harlem, Manhattan and Queens. Today, 
however, I find myself walking out of 
theatres dropping my “R’s” and contem-
plating the differences between the South 
Boston projects and Bunker Hill. 

So what makes the place so captivat-
ing? Boston historically has some of the 
poorest slums in the nation, stemming 
from the tides of Irish immigrants that 
settled there in the late 19th century. 
According to the now-numerous roman-
ticized films based in the city’s dingy 
streets, these 12 decades of poverty have 
bred a unique sense of pride and justice 
into the community with unapologeti-
cally tragic outcomes. Teen mothers leave 
toddlers in empty apartments to score 
heroin or oxy, and men have few moral 
qualms about turning to thievery when 
the only other job available is hard labor.

Charlestown also has the highest 
rate of bank robberies per capita in the 
nation, which just goes to show that 
these aren’t your average, run-of-the-mill 
thugs; it takes a lot of forethought and 
intelligence to execute such high-stakes 
crime. Southies take care of each other, 
these films tell us, and they have a sense 
of right and wrong that just happens to 
operate outside the law. 

Not since “The Godfather” have 
such riveting and fact-based crime films 
entered into the public consciousness. 
Perhaps such stories are so captivating 
because they each tackle the same desire 
for escape from polluted, tight-knit, 
dead-end communities. 

Their appeal is not hurt by the fact 
that these films have been graced by 
some of the most talented names in the 
business (Ben and Casey Affleck, Clint 
Eastwood), but the superb acting and 
directing only add to the allure of the 
stories themselves. 

I
nception” is a labyrinth of a movie. Dreams become real-
ity, reality morphs into dreams and — no matter how 
lost you might be — it’s all rather beautiful. But deep 
within this stylized dream world, just before limbo, there 
is a peculiar building. Hidden away amongst the snowy 

mountains lies an imagined fortress, the final roadblock to the 
film’s cerebral heist. It’s a strange-looking structure, resembling a 
totalitarian space ship. And it looks far, far too familiar.  

That’s right: Christopher Nolan, acclaimed director of “The 
Dark Knight” and “Memento,” has stolen Geisel. 

It’s a coincidence that could be easily attributed to simple 
architectural admiration, had there not been one more coinci-
dence in store. The film just so happens to star a UCSD grad.   

In this summer’s blockbuster smash, Dileep Rao (Muir ’95) 
plays the chemist Yusuf, an integral part of Leonardo DiCaprio’s 
team of memory-stealing thieves.

Our very own Dileep proves to be pivotal in this box-office 
explosion, driving the getaway van, making it rain when he has 
to pee and joking with his sleeping comrades (all in a dream, of 
course). For a school full of science devotees, this is no small feat. 

If you haven’t seen “Inception,” or at least read your friends’ ill-
fated analyses of it on Facebook, then you not only live under a 
rock, but an impossibly large boulder. 

Lulling bad guys to troubled sleep isn’t all Dileep has done: 
The dude has also had critical parts in Sam Raimi’s “Drag Me 
to Hell” and James Cameron’s Oscar-nominated “Avatar,” giving 
Rao one hell of a resumé. 

To prove to the La Jolla masses that you, too, can star in criti-
cally lauded films post-graduation, Dileep spoke at last week’s 
convocation ceremony, where he addressed the incoming fresh-
men and assured them that, as his unlikely experience proves, 
anything is possible.  

I caught up with the burgeoning star and he told me about 
his time here.

“My college experience was one of the unrestrained joy of 
learning, of irrepressible nerdiness [and] of being a smart per-
son at a smart school,” Dileep said. “I loved it. I thrived in it. I 
embraced being a dork, I embraced being bright and I think it

T he Social Network” director David Fincher isn’t exactly known for his true-life collegiate dramas.  
The bulk of his directorial experience 
is centered around violent cult clas-
sics like “Se7en,”  “Fight Club” and 
“Zodiac,” making him an unconven-
tional choice to direct a film about 
college nerds gallivanting through 
the halls of Harvard. But despite his 
resumé, Fincher — armed with writer 
Aaron Sorkin’s (“A Few Good Men”) 
caustic screenplay — has crafted a 
sharp cultural touchstone, our genera-
tion’s “Wall Street,” introducing the 
1987 premise of “greed is good” to a 
21st-century film about the origins of 
Facebook.

changed me for the better forever.” 
Hailing from Los Angeles, 

Dileep began his UCSD career as 
a pre-med student, but quickly 
found his chosen career path to 
be creatively stifling. Dileep then 
stowed away his chemistry text-
books and flocked to the stage.

“There was a part of me that 
was not being expressed in my 
journey to become a doctor…
There is more of a risk involved [in 
acting], but at least while I prac-
ticed the art and learned the craft 
there was something very personal 
about my expression through that,” 
Dileep said. 

Having plunged headfirst into 
his newfound passion, Dileep’s 
years as a Triton were far from 
boring. 

“You don’t know it when you’re 
there because you’re busy doing it, 
but my college experience was an 
incredibly dense, fun, surprising 
experience,” Dileep said. “There 
was all this stuff about being a 
doctor and then suddenly all this 
stuff about acting and theatre and 
writing and politics. And I was 
taking all these different classes; I 
would even crash courses I wasn’t 
registered in. I would learn so 
much about the world doing that.”

So yeah — just because he 
can call Leonardo DiCaprio and 
Joseph Gordon-Levitt colleagues 
doesn’t mean he isn’t a nerd too. 
Dileep has earned his UCSD 

badge of honor. In fact, he’s got 
one on you that you’ll never beat.

Dileep Rao was a contestant on 
“Jeopardy,” and he won. 

“I guess the nerdiness comes 
back to haunt me,” Dileep joked. 
The nerdiness paid off, as the 

money from his win helped 
Dileep bridge the gap between 
grad school at the American 
Conservatory Theater and his first 
job. 

More importantly, did he get to 
hang out with Trebek?

“Uh, no.” 
While I talk to him, Dileep ful-

fills the stereotype of an actor on 
the rise, walking though the streets 
of the Big Apple as he finishes the 
run of his first NYC theatre pro-
duction, “The Awesome Dance.” 
I have to repeat my questions 

because, with the taxis and sirens 
echoing in the background, he can 
barely hear me.

The past few years have been 
even more unbelievable for Dileep. 
He has found himself being 
interviewed at premieres for the 
first time, and given more and 
more opportunities to work with 
extraordinary people. 

“I was in Cannes with Sam. 
I mean, it was the Cannes Film 
Festival! Here I am sitting on the 
greatest red carpet in the world 
with Sam Raimi. And I’m like, 
‘Who could ever see this coming?’” 
Dileep mused.

He likened going to work 
on the set of “Inception” to the 
height of New York baseball glory. 
Working with actors like DiCaprio, 
Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard 
and Ellen Page every day, Dileep 
thought, “Wow, I’m in the 1927 
Yankees. I’m playing short-stop for 
the greatest team in the world.” 

He only has praise for cast-
mates. 

“What blows my mind is 
how talented those people are, 
how generous they are, how they 
worked so hard and how good 
they are at what they do,” Dileep 
added. “They just want something 
for nothing. People who get excel-
lence and get respect— you get 
that kind of acknowledgement 
because you are better than every-
one else.” 

So if the cast of “Inception” 

is a 20th-century sports meta-
phor, what would that make his 
experience working on “Avatar?” 
Apparently, quite the learning 
experience. 

“Working with [James 
Cameron] was the best,” Dileep 
said. “He is such an amazing artist 
and visionary … He is way ahead 
of his time, always challenging 
himself … I am proud of having 
been in his movie and working 
with him ... There aren’t many 
people who can do what he can 
do, and that’s pretty darn rare. 
When you look at his totality and 
comprehensive skill set, he is one 
of the greatest living film directors 
in the world.” 

Dileep doesn’t have anything in 
the works just yet. He just wrapped 
up his play, and he’s now shopping 
around for scripts. After all, with a 
track record like his, the next proj-
ect has to be perfect. 

So, back to the real question: 
Is Dileep responsible for Geisel’s 
newest claim to fame?

“Everyone keeps asking me 
this — ‘Is it Geisel, is it Geisel, is 
it Geisel?’” Dileep said. “I think 
it’s directly influenced, but from 
different shots and angles, it looks 
different. But there are definitely 
shots where it looks like the Geisel 
Library, no question. So maybe it 
was one of those fortuitous acci-
dental beauties that wasn’t able 
to be taken credit for. It just hap-
pened.”

ALBUMREVIEW

A fter riding on the coattails of releases past for a few years, the prolific Big Papa Smurf of grunge — the one and only Neil Young — is 
now giving us eight brand new tracks with Le Noise. 
Produced by Daniel Lanois of U2’s The Joshua Tree 
and Bob Dylan’s Time Out of Mind fame, the album 
is a boiled-down brew of stereotypical Young: a man 
on a stool, shredding it on a white Gretsch Falcon 
that saw the sixties trickle into the seventies with 
him.

The strange and almost mythical aura that sur-
rounds Young is only fueled by the elements that 
brought about the making of Le Noise: the man only 
recorded when there was a bad moon rising. The 
album took four full moons to record at Lanois’ 
Silver Lake mansion and — according to Young in 
the Chicago Tribune — Lanois made his Gretsch 
“sound like God.”

If God can speak, then he must be able to simul-
taneously sound electrified and unplugged, and 
heaven must be an echo chamber. Looped over 
riffage similar to that found in his work with Crazy 
Horse, Young’s 64-year-old voice describes nakedly 
autobiographical tales of loss. This year, Young lost 
both his steel guitarist Ben Keith to a heart attack in 
his own home, as well as filmmaker Larry Johnson, 
with whom Young collaborated since they met at 
Woodstock. 

The songwriter also ruminates on the trite theme 
of love and war in an acoustic track titled — what 
else — “Love and War.” It’s not exactly new material 
for Young, who has crafted more enduring politi-
cal anthems like “Rockin’ In The Free World,” but 
it proves to be one of the album’s more accessible 
tracks. The same could be said of feedback-heavy 
opener “Walk with Me,” a reflection upon regretful 
choices.

The album isn’t the easiest album to digest in 
Young’s decade-spanning career — with no one but 
the man and the electric guitar, the tracks are more 
atmospheric than melodic. However, the songwriter 
has crafted an album full of impeccably surreal 
grooves, showing that the AARP-generation can still 
own 39 minutes like it’s no one’s business.

V1_46699.2_5x7.75_4c_Ad.indd   1 9/27/10   12:57 PM

Every director, no matter how talented, has a signature fixation that makes a film his own. Clint Eastwood likes 
heavy shadows. Spike Lee likes his actors 
on dollies. And the prolific Woody Allen 
likes  himself. 

You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger is 
no exception. Like Allens classics Annie 
Hall and Manhattan, 
the tale about love and 
(failed) marriage is a 
reflection of his own 
neuroses, showcasing the 
insane obstacle course 
that men and women put 
themselves through in 
search of happiness.

Naomi Watts plays 
Sally, an art-gallery assistant in a tense 
marriage with a failing writer (Josh 
Brolin). Shes also coping with a suicidal-
turned-alcoholic mother (Gemma Jones), 

who supports them financially  between 
binges, at least  and an oblivious father 
(Anthony Hopkins) who has married a 
young escort to stave off mortality.

The characters careen through the plot 
at full speed, making unbelievable choices 
that only make sense given Allens sheer 
trust in the world hes created. Sally falls 

head-over-heels for 
her unhappily mar-
ried boss (Antonio 
Banderas) as her 
husband stalks a 
neighbor (Freida 
Pinto) and an obvi-
ously phony psychic 
seduces her mother. 
Allens tight screen-

writing grounds the fiasco in the real 
world, however ridiculous and over-the-
top it may get. His characteristic handle 
on irony keeps Stranger enjoyable.

It easily could have been depressing. 
The third act sees some dramatic drops 
in morale for all the main players. No one 
gets what they want, and despite shared 
devotion to falling in love, affairs and 
marriages sour. Its typical Allen. Lifes 
absurdity is exposed, the pathetic go unre-
warded and the writer plays the fool. 

Since its such standard Allen-fare, 
Stranger wont disappoint the diehards 
and serves as a good introduction for 
those foreign to the directors shtick.

The films only downfall is also char-
acteristic: The actors seem vaguely out 
of place in their roles. Though the cast 
veterans make a seasoned attempt to move 
naturally through Allens world, there is 
no disguising their discomfort. The film-
maker makes the characters into facets of 
his own personality  so that Allen is the 
only true fit for each role. You know, like 
the Jewish Nutty Professor.

FILMREVIEW

Chronically unpopular antihero Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse 
Eisenberg) is both a scathing social outcast and a brilliant 
programmer. The 19-year-olds social leprosy and desire for 
popularity leads him to enlist the help  and money  of 
best (read: only) friend Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield). 

Together, the two devise Facemash.com, a website that 
allows peers to rate and compare Harvard girls based on 
appearance. Facemash generates so much traffic that it crash-
es Harvards servers, drawing the attention of twins Cameron 
and Tyler Winklevoss (Armie Hammer and Josh Pence) and 
fellow co-ed Divya Narendra (Max Minghella), who recruit 
Zuckerberg to help them program a new site called Harvard 
Connect. Building on their groundwork Zuckerberg cre-
ates the blueprints for thefacebook.com  aided by Napster 
co-founder Sean Parkers (Justin Timberlake) determination 
and Saverins financial support. From there, the film follows 
Zuckerbergs decline, highlighting legal and personal battles 
that dog the entrepreneurs footsteps on his way to the top. 

 Casting Eisenberg  who typically stars as the sweet 
and graceless romantic in movies like Adventureland and 
Zombieland  as hard-ass Zuckerberg seems like a fatal 
error, but he slides into the role remarkably well. Sorkins 
trademark rapid-fire dialogue throughout this journey arms 
the self-absorbed Zuckerberg with a biting, sarcastic edge 
as he steps over (and sometimes on) his co-creators with 
alarming ease. Throughout the legal proceedings, Eisenberg 
effortlessly shifts from humor to heartbreak, shooting one-
liners (If you were the inventors of Facebook, youd have 
invented Facebook) while harboring the intense loneliness of 
a Grade-A asshole.

Similar praise goes to Justin Timberlake, who feels right 
at home in the over-the-top lifestyle of the Napster founder 
 and no, the irony of casting a pop star as the first major 
force behind illegal downloading is not lost on anyone. From 
the first time the gang meets him in a fancy restaurant, 
Timberlakes charm makes it clear just why Zuckerberg fell 
under his spell. 

Real-life Zuckerberg has taken great pains to distance 
himself from The Social Network. The billionaire insists 
that the film is an intricate fictional tapestry crafted by Sorkin 
 an unsurprising move considering his poor representation. 
In what seems like a last-ditch effort to save face, Zuckerberg 
scheduled an appearance on Oprah last week, where he stated 
his intent to donate $100 million to the Newark, New Jersey 
school system.

But for Fincher and Sorkin  who have crafted a film 
that explores both the dark side of human nature and the 
humble beginnings of the worlds biggest social network  
Zuckerbergs rantings are nothing more than the calm before 
the Oscar storm.

“Jesse Brennan has taken on an 
important role. He’s taken over that 
[keeper] spot and has been noticed,” 
Pascale said.

Brennan hasn’t just been noticed 
by his teammates and coaches, but 
by others within the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association. The 
keeper was awarded the CCAA player 
of the week for his efforts. 

“It was a real honor,” Brennan said. 
“I was in class and my captain texted me 
[about it], and I was shocked because I 
didn’t even know that [CCAA Player of 
the Week] existed.”

Brennan attributes his strong per-
formance to an intense off-season 
workout regimen. 

“We went through an entire sum-

mer in training,” Brennan said. “A lot 
of weight training.  Keepers are a lot 
about power. Because we only have 
18 yards to work with, we’re really 
focused on quickness and power.”

The games kick off at 4:30 p.m. and

is really good.”

▶ M. SOCCER, fromÊpageÊ16

UC San Diego looked to carry 
this momentum into their match 
on Sunday where they played to 
a 0-0 overtime draw against San 
Francisco State University. 

The Gators are currently ranked 
third in the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association North 
Division. 

Despite the final score, the 
Tritons poured on the offense 
throughout the game, tallying 17 
shots compared to the Gators’ nine.

“It was a disappointing loss, 
because the game was one of the 
best we have played this season,” 
Armstrong said. “We connected a 
lot better and were able to keep 
possession. But San Francisco really 
played for the tie, and in the end we 
weren’t able to finish.”

Armstrong tallied her 10th 
career shutout with the draw.  

Armstrong and the Triton 
defense — consisting of Johnson, 
junior defense Sara Spaventa and 
anchored by sophomore defense 
Ellen Wilson, smothered the San 
Francisco attack, keeping San 
Francisco State scoreless and limit-
ing the Gators to a paltry four shots 
on goal.

On the other end of the pitch, 
the Triton attackers combined to 
create a number of scoring chances.   

In the first half, Ilg and Wong 
recorded three dangerous attempts 
apiece in front of the Gator goal.  

But San Francisco State goal-
keeper Annica Jones mustered an 
impressive career high of 10 saves, 
keeping the Tritons scoreless.  

The best chance for UCSD came 
in the 109th minute, nearing the 
end of the overtime period.  

Johnson sent a corner kick into 
the box that found its way to Ilg, but 
the striker narrowly missed attain-
ing what would have been her fifth 
goal of the season because she hit 
the crossbar just moments before 
the final whistle.

With eight games under their 
belt, the Tritons are now 4-2-2 
overall and 2-2-2 in the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association. 

“We are expecting to keep taking 
steps forward,” senior captain Lisa 
Bradley said after the match.  “We 
played well this past weekend. Now 

we just need to continue on what we 
have built and start putting the ball 
in the net.” 

The Tritons will have to do 
just that when they host CSU San 
Bernardino this Friday, Oct. 1 at 7 
p.m. The Coyotes will be looking to 
rebound after falling out of the top 
25 last week. 

The team was ranked 14th 
nationally before going 0-2-1 in 
their last three games. 

The Tritons will follow that 
game with a match against Cal Poly 
Pomona on Oct. 3 at 2:30 p.m.

“The situation we’ve gone through recently has been 

a reality check for this team,” Werhane said. “It has given 
us a little more motivation and focus during practice this 
week. I think this week we’ve had three of the best prac-
tices we’ve had since starting the season.” 

Cal State Stanislaus went to 8-4 overall and 5-2 in the 
CCAA with the win.

The Tritons will look to rebound with their next four 
games at home. Their first chance to snap their losing 
streak will be a tough test against No. 23 Cal State L.A.

The Golden Eagles ended the Tritons season last year 
in the NCAA West Region Semifinals.

“It doesn’t matter that Cal State L.A. is ranked,” 
Werhane said. “Last weekend shouldn’t have any say on 
what happens this weekend. We still have a grudge match 
against them.”

The game will be Friday, Oct. 1, with first serve at 7 
p.m.  

The Tritons will finish off the weekend by facing off 
against Cal State Dominguez Hills.

Tritons Return Home 
Trying to Get Back on Track
By Liam Rose 
Sports Editor

WOMEN’S VOLLEYBALL — After two 
straight weekends of road games and five 
straight losses, the Tritons will certainly be 
happy to see their home court again. 

The UCSD Women’s Volleyball team fell 
to Chico State and Cal State Stanislaus on 
Sept. 24 and 25, extending their losing streak 
to five games. The Tritons lost a 2-3 decision 
against Chico State, their fourth straight loss 
that lasted five sets at the time. Cal State 
Stanislaus beat the Tritons 3-1 the following 
night.

“I think we have to go into the game with 
a different mentality,” senior libero Janessa 
Wehane said. “We can’t let the last five games 
control or dictate how we go into this week-
end.”

The current five-game skid marks the 
longest the program has suffered since 1992

The Tritons had a 2-1 lead after 3 games 
against Chico State, but were unable to hang 
on as the Wildcats rallied to take the last two 
games 25-23 and 20-18. 

Junior Katie Condon led the Tritons with 
20 kills, while sophomore Julia Freidenberg 
added 15. Werhane had 18 digs, and junior 
Hilary Williamson added 16 in her first game 
back from an injury. 

After losing the first set 25-14, the Tritons 
came back to win the next two sets. UCSD 
was especially dominant in the third set — 
winning 25-13 — but couldn’t win the next 
two.

Chico State improved to 8-4 on the sea-
son, including 3-3 in the CCAA, while UCSD 
fell to 5-5 overall and 2-4 in conference play.

Williamson was not the only Triton with 
injury problems, as UCSD was still without 
All-American senior Roxanne Brunsting due 
to an ankle injury.

On the Sept. 25 match against Cal State 
Stanislaus, outside hitter Lianne Vicchio tal-
lied 12 kills and 11 digs, UCSD was held 
to a paltry .179 hitting percentage and the 
Warriors managed a 25-19, 24-26, 25-20, 
25-22 victory over the Tritons. Vicchio was 
later named CCAA Player of the Week for 
her efforts.

Werhane had 25 digs and Freidenberg and 
freshman Sally Yingst gave 10 kills apiece for 
the Tritons, but it was not enough to keep the 
team from losing their fifth straight game and 
falling to 5-6 overall on the season. 

UCSD fell out of the national rankings 
after starting the season at the No. 8 spot, 
and are unranked for the first time since Aug.

MEN’S SOCCER — After a shaky 
start to the 2010 soccer season, the 
Tritons seem to have finally found their 
rhythm. The men’s soccer team defeat-
ed both Cal State Monterey Bay and 
San Francisco State in style with back-
to-back shutouts on Sept. 24 and 26.

The newfound winning streak 
began with an early goal scored by 
senior Shane Micheil in the Cal State 
Monterey game. His 19th-minute goal, 
assisted by senior Brandon Yee, gave 
the Tritons a 1-0 lead going into the 
half. The Tritons maintained their lead 
by stifling Cal State Monterey’s offense, 
as the Otters were prevented from tak-
ing single shot until the 58th minute of 
the game.

The team’s win in Monterey marked 
the first victory of the season. While the 
Tritons played a tight offensive game 
overall, it was Shane Micheil’s goal early 
in the first half that won them the 
match.

“It obviously feels great to score 
goals,” Micheil said. “It was super excit-
ing to pull out the win.”

Micheil comes into this season with 
a successful track record from last year, 
racking up four goals and three assists 
in the 2009 season. 

“It’d be nice to do better than I 
did last year, but that’s not my focus,” 
Micheil said. “My goal is to make it to 
playoffs and go from there.”

Following their success in Monterey, 
the men’s soccer team arrived in San 
Francisco and won that game by a 
decisive 2-0 margin. The first goal was 
made off a set piece by sophomore Kian 
Malek in the last four minutes of the 
first half. Sophomore Evan Walker fur-
ther cemented the win with a goal off a 
breakaway in the 53rd minute of play.

“Every single guy played defense,” 
Coach Jon Pascale said in regard to the 
team’s success. “We had possession of 
the ball a lot and didn’t let them get any 
chances to score.”

Over on the other side of the pitch, 
newcomer stalwart freshman Jesse 
Brennan has made his presence known 
by making a total of seven saves in the 
two games played. After the successful 
weekend, Brennan has three shutouts 
on the season.

WOMEN’S SOCCER — The women’s soccer team returned 
from their two-game campaign in the Bay Area with mixed 
results, beating CSU Monterey Bay 4-1 on Sept. 24, but only 
managing a frustrating 0-0 draw with San Francisco State 
two days later. 

The Tritons came into Friday’s match against Monterey 
Bay having suffered a 1-2 loss to CSU Humboldt on Sept. 
17, which dropped them from the national rankings for the 
first time in the 2010 season.  

UCSD came back strong in their game against the 
Otters, netting four goals from four different Tritons.

The match quickly became a showcase of the Triton 
offense, as UCSD outshot CSU Monterey Bay 24-3.  

The first goal was provided by sophomore forward Gabi 
Hernandez, who sent a header into the back of the net off 
a cross from sophomore Hayley Johnson at the 27-minute 
mark.  

The header marked Hernandez’s third goal of the season 
and Johnson’s fourth assist.

“I didn’t even really need to do anything but stay in front 
of the keeper and jump,” Hernandez said.  “[Johnson] has 
been practicing her corners and free kicks relentlessly; she 
always does good things with the ball.”

Just four minutes later, CSU Monterey Bay scored an 
equalizer when sophomore midfielder Marlina Massagli 
tied the game at 1-1 off an assist from sophomore mid-
fielder Gabriella Bozzo. 

The scored remained tied until the second half when 
juniors Sarah McTigue and Shelby Wong connected in 
front of the goal in the 57th minute. McTigue sent a header 
past Monterey goalkeeper Graciela Holguin off of a cross 
from Wong.  

“McTigue scored a great goal at the beginning of the 
second half that enabled our attack and really opened the 
floodgates for us,” junior keeper Kristin Armstrong said.

The Tritons netted two more goals in the dying minutes 
of the match. The third goal came in the 80th minute from 
sophomore forward Alyssa Newcomer, who capitalized on 
a rebound from another cross by Johnson. 

Just two minutes later, graduate student forward Annette 
Ilg finished the Otters off by knocking in a chance rebound 
for her fourth goal of the season.
