University bureaucracy stonewalls 
student in privacy rights' case 
By JOHN SHAW 
r,."., Dhcfor 

He has written to the chancel-
lor of UCSD, the president of 
the Uaiversity of California, and 
the chairman of the Board of 
Re,ents. He has written to his 
senator, his assemblyman, the 
governor of California, and the 
United States Department of 
Education. He has gathered 
stacks of University and federal 
regulations and accumulated 
hundreds of pages of correspon-
dence. He has done everythina 
you are supposed to do when 
you have a problem. The trouble 
is that few people are listening to 
him and far fewer are bothering 
to help. 

What began as a simple grie-
vance over an alleged violation 
of his privacy rights has trans-
formed into an exhaustive one-
man crusade to force University 
officials to follow their own rules. 
In the 10 months that Revelle 
Student Bard-Alan Finlan has 
been fighting the University, he 
has lost more than his health and 

,ood G.P.A.; he has lost what 
little confidence he had in the 
system. 

In June of 1987 Finlan filed a 
complaint with the University 
over an alle,ed violation of his 
privacy ri,hts when a depart-
ment on campus accessed and 
used his personal records with-
out his knowled,e or consent. 
(Finlan has asked that the details 
of the incident leadin, to his 
complaint not be published to 
ensure that his and others' pri-
vacy not be further violated.) 

A federal law known as the 
Family Educational Rights and 
Privacy Act (FERPA) requires 
universities to make known pub-
licly which departments on cam-
pus have access to student per-
so .. 1 records. At UCSD this 
disclosure is printed in the quar-
terly class schedule. The go-
vernment also requires each 
campus to draft policies that 
meet FERPA privacy regulations 
and to adopt procedures by which 
students can have allegations of 
privacy rights violations con-
sidered. 

At the time of Finlan's com-
plaint, Under,raduate Af-
fairs/ Special Services (U A/ SS) 
Director Nicholas Aguilar 
handed Finlan a campus docu-
ment that outlined both his pri-
vacy ri,hts and how to go about 
obtainin, a hearin, to determine 
if his ri,bts were, in fact, vio-
lated. The document, Univ~rsity 
of Cali/ornill Polici~s and UC 
San Di~go Cllmpus R~gulations 
Applying to Campus Activities, 
Organizlltions. and Students 
(UCSD Campus Regulations), 
stated that Finlan was allowed 
the option of requesting a formal 
hearin, of his complaint to be 
heard by either a hearina officer 
or by a hearins committee. 

The document stipulates that 
a hearing committee shall con-
sist of staff, students, and a per-
son to be chosen by the grievant. 
The hearing officer, however, is 
chosen by the vice chancellor of 
undergraduate affairs - Dr. 
Joseph Watson. In both cases, 
the vice chancellor makes the 
final decision of whether to 
accept or reject the judament of 

the hearing committee or hear-
ing officer. 

Finlan assumed that a hearing 
committee that included several 
students would weigh his inter-
ests against the University's 
interests more fairly than would 
a hearing officer employed by 
the University of California. Fin-
Ian informed the University that 
he desired a hearing before a 
committee but, much to his sur-
prise, the university replied that 
that wouldn't be possible. Ac-
cording to Section 160-2 of the 
Policies and Procedures Manual 
(PPM 160-2), the University 
argued, Finlan was entitled to a 
hearing by a hearing officer only. 
Under considerable protest, Fin-
Ian attended the hearing where 
his complaint was later denied . 

"I had a feeling that what they 
were saying didn't make any 
sense," Finlan said. He requested 
background information on P PM 
160-2, did some research, and 
found that the document had 
never received formal approval 
by UC President David Gardner.

Alcohol 
detector 
invented 

Researchers at UCSD and the 
Veterans Administration Medi-
cal Center in La Jolla reported 
that they have developed a sim-
ple, accurate tool that may help 
clinicians monitor abstinence 
among recovering alcoholics who 
have completed inpatient alco-
hol treatment programs. 

The ability to intervene early 
in the drinking cycle could help 
avert the spiral of drinking and 
associated problems before 
physical and behavioral patterns 
make abstinence difficult, ac-
cording to Michael Irwin, M.D., 
principal author of the report 
that appears in the May issue of 
the American Journal of Psych~a­
try. 

Until now, clinicians have had 
to rely on their own observation 
or on patients admittinl they 
had returned to drinkm" but 
these methods are not objective 
or accurate, particularly in iden-
tifying an early pattern of mod-
erate drinking. Statistically, 
about 20 percent of patients who 
are drinking deny it when asked, 
BN4lr . n,..assistaDt professor of 
psychiatry at tile UCSD School 
of Medicine and a researcher at 
the Veterans Administration 
Medical Center in La Jolla. 

Now, using standard labora-
tory tests and measurin, changes 
in certain liver enzymes, Irwin's 
,roup has found they can accu-
rately identify those who have 
returned to drinking, eVeD ia 
moderate ,motants. 

The tests, which are inexpen-
sive and widely available, mea-
sure the levels of certain liver 
enzymes that increase with alco-
hol intake - aIutamyl transpep-
tidase (GGT), aspartate amino-
tranferase (SGOT) and alanine 
aminotransferase (SGPT). 

In this study of 135 men, Irwin 
and his collea,ues documented 
that relatively minor increases in 
these three enzyme levels afler 
discharge from a treatment pro-
gram can accurately identify a 
recovering alcoholic who has 
been drinking as little as two or 
three drinks a day for one week.

Student battles bureaucracy 
Continued rrom pale 1 
According to University system-
wide relulations, privacy-rights 
policies must receive presidential 
approval before they can be 
implemented. PPM 160-2 had 
not received that approval and 
therefore, Finlan concluded, the 
document was invalid; by default 
UCSD Campus RegulatiOns 
should be used instead. Based on 
this assumption, Finlan rea-
soned, he was entitled to a new 
hearinl by a committee as he had 
originally requested. Vice Chan-
cellor Joseph Watson and UAI 
SS Director Nicholas Aguilar 
disaareed. 

Even thouah PPM 160-2 had 
never been approved, Watson 
and Aguilar maintained that the 
document complied with other 
existing UC systemwide policies 
and procedures and therefore 
Finlan had received "due pro-
cess. " 

Anaered by the Univenity's 
refusal to follow its own regula-
tions, Finlan sought the assist-
ance of UCSD Counseling At-
torney Carrie Wilson. Wilson 
reviewed the case and then draf-
ted a letter to UC Senior Vice 
President William Frazer charg-
ing that: "Mr. Finlan has been 
denied his clearly delineated rilht 

required by law. In spite of the 
Department of Education's posi-
tion, Vice Chancellor Watson 
has refused to alter his stance on 
the issues. 

When queried about the go-
vernment's assessment of Fiolan's 
complaint Watson replied, "I 
don't care who feels what way. I 
feel strongly about [the correct-
ness of accessing Finlan'l per-
sonal records]. I'm prepared to 
push this one all the way .. . The 
Department of Education never 
really looked at the situation." 

Finlan disagrees. "Dr. Watson 
is wrong to think that the De-
partment of Education il un-
aware of the circumstances sur-
rounding the violation. From 
the beginning I informed tbem 
about all the circumstances sur-
roundinl the violation. I wanted 
to be sure that I had a legitimate 
complaint. It is the University 
that has given the Department of 
Education misleadina informa-
tion about the matter," Fiolan 
said. 

Finlan continued to call and 
write the office of the UC presi-
dent in Berkeley hoping to gain 
some assistance. What he got 
was the run-around and a lot of 
bureaucratic double-talk. 

") went to UCSD officials with

to a hearinl before a hearing 
committee and this has resulted 
in a violation of his rigbts to pro-
cedural due process." The Uni-
versity showed no signs of alter-
inl its position. 

"The system wasn't working at 
all, " Finlan said of tbe ordeal. MIt 
seemed like the University was 
more concerned witb protectinl 
their own interests than beinl 
fair to me. ) feel a larle amount 
of resentment toward tbe U ni-
versity for the way tbey handled 
the whole situation. My anger 
has increased by the run-around 
I've been lettina." 

Finlan persisted in his letter-
writina campaign in hopes that 
somehow someone milht get the 
University to listen to reason. 
Finlan had contacted the U.S. 
Department of Education at the 
same time he filed his oriainal 
grievance. Upon consideration 
of the evidence, the government 
ruled that the University had 
indeed violated Finlan's privacy 
rights and that the Univenity 
was also in violation of FERPA 
laws stipulating that all students 
must be notified which campus 
departments have access to their 
personal records. The depart-
ment that accessed and used Fin-
lan's personal records was not 
listed in the class schedule as is 

my complaints and I was told to 
talk to tbe Office of the Presi-
dent," Finlan said. "The Office 
of the President turned around 
and said to talk to UCSD. Every 
time I called tbey were either got 
to lunch or in a meeting. ) JOt 
this kind of thing all tbe time." 

Counseling Attorney Carrie 
Wilson alrees tbat the Univer-
sity is often less than belpful in 
such cales. 

"Because the Univenity is such 
a large bureaucracy, it doesn't 
always deal with things reasona-
bly,"she said. "It's a lot easier for 
them jUlt to say 'no' than to 
investilate complaints tho-
rouply." 

In February 1988, Vice Chan-
cellor Watson informed Finlan 
tbat be would be given a new 
hearina by committee. What he 
didn't say was that he still wasn't 
loing to abide by the details of 
the committee outline in the 
campus' only existina presiden-
tially approved FERPA docu-
ment - UCSD Campw Regula-
tions. Once aaain, Finlan pro-
tested. 

"Essentially what the Univer-
sity hopes for is that the student 
will live up," Finlan said . 
"There's a frustration factor that 
everyone has. I decided from the 
very beginning that I would 

pursue this to the end and not be 
intimidated. Persistence is really 
the key. Very few people would 
take it this far, because they 
become frustrated and are not 
willing to spend the time. I believe 
the University takes advantage 
of the average student's naivete . 
Even the chancellor said to me 
that 'there arc some matten that 
bave to be taken to court.' They 
know the average student doesn't 
bave the knowledle, time, finan-
ces, or emotional resources to 
get involved in a three-year legal 
battle with a multi-billion dollar 
corporation that has lawyers 
from here to eternity and back," 
Finlan said. 

Upon Counseling Attorney 
Carrie Wilson's suggestion, Fin-
Ian wrote to several government 
officials, including the governor, 
asking for assistance. His per-
sistcnceappeared to pay off when 
he obtained a copy of an April 14 
letter from UC systemwide Stu-
dent Affairs and Services Direc-
tor Mary Beth Snyder to Vice 
Chancellor Watson. 

Snyder writes: "In the opinion 
of [University Legal] Counsel, 
the University could face legal 
liability if we do not follow 
procedures that conform to our 
own approved policies . Accord-
ingly, I recommend that the 
campus provide Mr. Finlan with 
a hearing of all his various grie-
vances before a panel that is 
convened in a manner that con-
forms in every detail to the' Uni-

v~rsity of CQlijornia Policies and 
UC San Di~go Campw Regu-
lations Applying to Campus 
Activities. Organizations and 
Students .• " 

Because of University Legal 
Counsel's recommendation, Vice 
Chancellor Watson hall apeed 
to provide Finlan with a hearing 
before a committee. Watson 
admits he made a bad decision 
by not giving Finlan a hearing 
before a committee in the first 
place. 

"I think if we went 10 months 
with a position and then finally 
General Counsel tells us it's 
wrong, then I think we made a 
bad judgment, Watson said . "I'm 
willing to say I made a bad 
judgment on it, because it has 
been corrected." 

Watson still maintains, how-
ever, that the department that 
accessed Finlan's personal re-
cords was completely justified in 
doing so. 

"The procedural aspects of 
[Finlan's complaint] are fully 
open to discussion and judgment 
and I'm prepared to say that 
given the ruling by University 
Counsel we didn't exercise the 
correct judlment ., . If it turns 
out that what was done was 
inappropriate [accessing Finlan's 
personal records] I will tben go 
and seek a change in University 
policy to make what wal done 
appropriate," Watson said. "I 
feel so strongly that what was 
done was absolutely correct and 
necessary that I will initiate an 
effort to chanle University pol-

Sour Grapes 
Twenty years ago, Robert Kennedy won the 

California Democratic Presidential primary after 
forming an alliance with the United Farm Workers 
and their leader, Cesar Chavez. Enduring voter 
challenges and long lines at inadequate polling 
structures, Latinos in and out of the farm labor 
movement made the difference in Kennedy's cam-
paign against the still dangerous Hubert Humphrey. 

Kennedy was shot and killed that night and with 
his life went one of the last hopes for serious reform 
in American politics. 

In the wake of Kennedy's death , Chavez has been 
left to fight an often lonely and always underfunded 
struggle on behalf of the most seriously exploited 
workers on the American labor scene. 

The UFW's efforts have extended beyond simple 
(but still necessary) fights for a living wage. The 
union is currently asking consumers to boycott 
California grapes because pesticides used to "pro-
tect" the grapes are killing its workers. 

Parathion, Methyl Bromide, Dionsev, Captan 
and Phostrin, all known carcinogens, all "highly 
suspected" of causing birth defects by the declawed 
Environmental Protection Agency, are used by 
California growers and find their way into the lungs, 
skin and , finally, the graves of farm workers. 

California grapes will be coming into local super-
markets in three weeks or so. Ralph's is now selling 
Chilean grapes while Von's is selling grapes from 
both Chile and Florida. 

We urge all students to honor the UFW boycott 
- ask your grocery store where it gets its grapes and 
make clear you won't buy California grapes. 

In the meantime, you might want to watch out for 
those Chilean grapes . Chile still allows the use of 
DDT, and inspection procedures are, the UFW 
claims, lax for grapes coming into this country. 

Tracking Food 
We read in the Stanford Daily last week that the 

food service there is donating enough unused cafete-
ria food to feed about 60 hungry people a week. 

Is UCSD doing anything like that? No. 
First, the University has a policy against donating 

anything like chipped glassware or unused food 
since it is "University property." We don't know 
why the policy exists; we do know it's not because of 
liability problems. The "Good Samaritan Act," a 
California state law, protects those donating items 
in good faith . If someone eats tainted leftover U ni-
versity food, the University can not be sued. "Better 
Safe Than Sorry," however, seems to have replaced 
"Let There Be Light" as the UC motto . 

Second, there is not a lot of leftover food accord-
ing to the food service. Using a complicated compu-
ter program relying on cycles of 35 days for the 
cafeterias and seven days for the cash stores, predic-
tions are made as to just exactly how much broccoli 
cheesebake, eggplant surprise and donuts will be 
consumed that week. Food service coordinators say 
it saves them a "ton" of money and prevents much 
waste of food. 

There is some wasted food, especially fruits and 
beverages. UCSD Food Service plans to put posters 
in the cafeterias to make students aware of world 
hunger and will ask students to put uneaten fruit, for 
example, in large bowls so it can be offered again to 
the students the next day. 

All this seems to us to be fairly typical of the 
University as it is presently constituted: efficient , 
self-contained and not particularly willing to go out 
of its way to help those in need. 

Many of us grew up believing in the possibilities 
of the UC system and rooting for Cal in the Big 
Game. It's galling and ironic to see that the snobs at 
Stanford, as we say with the utmost respect, are 
showing compassion in more creative and thought-
ful ways than we are.

form a small cup. Into this, a 
technician drops some milligrams of 
a substance (shampoo, nail polish, 
etc.) to be tested. The eye is then held 
closed for several seconds. The other 
eye is left untreated to serve as a 
control. 

The rabbit's eyes are then obsc:rved 
at specific intervals to see how severe 
the irritation is. Is the lid swollen? 
The iris inflamed? The cornea ulcer-
ated? Are the rabbits blinded in that 
eye? 

The results are noted on charts in 
case someone files a lawsuit against 
the manufacturer. The rabbits are 
then destroyed . 

The Draize test is only one exam-
ple of the type of experiment your 
respondent has Bugs Bunny posi-

tioned to suport. 
Seems a little suspect to me.

College Bowl 
Gets Bucks 
Editor: 

In your article on the College 
Bowl, [Guardian, May 5], statements 
were twice attributed to Andrew 
K.ahng that were never made in an 
interview. This led to a confused 
picture, panicularly in the matter of 
funding for the team, and we would 
like to clarify that now. 

In an April 26 meeting of Univer-
sity and college administration mem-
bers, funding was committed for the 
trip to Nationals. Thus, during the 
weeks that the article was written, 
funding was actually a non-issue. 
The suppon came from the indivi-
dual colleges, the University ad-
ministration (including the chancel-
lor and the vice chancellor), and the 
A.S. 

Randy Woodard of the Student 
Affairs office was instrumental in 
procuring these funds as reported in 
pan in another article on the same 
page of the May 5 Guardian. Wood-
ard also told the Guardian that the 
College Bowl funds had been ob-
tained . 

For the record, the UCSD team 
would like to thank this year's 
College Bowl Committee (Yolanda 
Garcia. Vince Manaon, Scott Parker 
and Barbara Waters), Randy Wood-
ard and the school'. ACUI repre-
sentative, Evan Weisenfield, for their 
tremendous efforts in this regard. 
We hope that our performance at 
Nationals will be worthy of the 
school's support.

SDI a Failure 
From the Start 
Editor: 

President Realao'l Stratepc 
Defense Initiative may become the 
most expensive booodogle of the 
20th century. The proposed syskID 
is intrinsically complex and so easily 
circumvented that it will always be 
unworkable. 

The software needed to orches-
trate a missile defense system durio& 
an actual attack is estimated to be 
larger and more complex thaD any-
thing ever created by a factor of at 
least 100. 

Furthermore, this software can-
not be tested until it is fint used in 

. battle and 10 can never be thor-
oushly debugcd. 

There is conaiderable doubt in the 
scientific community .. to wIIedIcr 
many of tbele loais caa ew:r be 
realized. The Rc:apnadmiDistralia. 
is copizant of this and .... ra::catIJ 
downlTaded the scope of SDI. 
Instead of protc:cti1lJ the CIdiR 
country, SOl is DOW bciq cleft..

Phot~ and Interviews by K.tbleen Donabue 

This brings us to the most 
dangerous effect of SOL It will 
destabilize a weapons impasse 
which has long deterred both 
sides from attempting a first 
strike. Orbiting missile defense 
systems can easily be used for 

offensive purposes. This is a 
threat which the Soviets would 
quickly move to counter in an 
incident which could trigger a 
much deadlier exchange. 

Spending for fiscal year 1988 
for SOl was almost 54 billion. 

The request for fiscal year 1989 is 
over $5 billion. This is an 
unconscionable amount of money 
to spend on such a dangerous 
and unfeasible endeavor.

"Sure beats standing in line ... It's great!"

Finlan feels equally as strong 
that what was done was wrong 
and is prepared to fight this 
"until hell freezes over," 

"I have attempted on numer-
ous occasioRl to address the 
underlying concerns of the issue 
with Dr, Watson, but he hal 
consistently refused to dialolue 
with me," Finlan laid. "He 
[Watson] is 10 wrapped up in 
defendinl Univenity interestl 
that he leavCl no room for an 
unbiuccl evaluation of the details 
lead in. to the violation. He just 
jumps to conclusions without 
factual bui.," 

Even thou.h Watson hal 
apeed to Jive Finlan a hearinl 
before a committee, he has yet to 
set a date, Finlan il skeptical 
about whether hil complaint will 
be handled fairly this time. 

"Whatever the hearinl body 
rulCi il not the final decision," 
Fiolan laid. "With aU due respect 
to Dr. Wataon, if he hal the 
audacity to i,nore the federal 
lovernment, I have little optim-
ilm to think that he would take 
the recommendation of the com-
mittee." 

In a letter to Governor Dcuk-
mejian Finlan WritCl: "I regard 
the way [the University] has 
treated me and this issue as a 
quintcucntial example of why 
the relationship between studentl 
and the administration in the 
University of California system 
is .uch a poor one; fraught with

ties 10metimCi approachinl out-
riaht hostility. The Univenity 
.hould function as a public trust 
in its educative and research 
capacity and not as a private, 
self-seeking entity ... " 

As it stand., Finlan ila waitin. 
a hearinl date, In the meantime, 
he is still receivinl letten from 
Director AJUilar iRlistinl that 
PPM 160-1 is the appropriate 
document to usc under certain 
circumstances in spite of the fact 
that the Office of the President 
has pointed out to Aauilar that 
the document is invalid until it 
receives presidential approval. 
Aguilar submitted the document 

for approval nearly two months 
ago and expects it to be approved 
soon, When and if it is approved, 
students will no longer have the 
option of a hearing committee 
and the University will not be 
required to abide by any manda-
tory time guidelines for process-
inl complaints. 

As Director Aguilar put it: 
"The interest of the University is 
not to get locked into rigid rules 
and relulations. The interest of 
the University is to respond to 
complaints in the fairest and 
most efficient way pOlSible, 
keepinl the Itudent's best inter-
est at heart at all times. That is 
why we're here." 

Finlan has his doubts, 

Alcohol 
CODtiaued fro. pap I 
intervene if a patient is startinl 
to drink again are crucial to that 
penon's chances of SUCCCII," he 
said, "Our results are prelimi-
nary and certainly more tCitinl 
and refinin. need to be done, but 
it is our hope that cliniciaRl will 
incorporate these tests into their 
aftercare proarams and that its 
use will help improve the rather 
dismal statistics in the field of 
alcoholi.m rehabilitation." 

Irwin laid 30 percent of people 
who complete an aleoholilm 
treatment proaram have a major 
relapse within three months and 
beain to return to their old drink-
inl levels, Another 30 percent 
have a minor relapse durin, that 
time and start drinkinl apin, 
either sporadically or at lower 
levels than previously cODiumed, 

"Even a minor relapse is cause 
for concern because moderate 
drinking orten escalates rapidly 
to heavy drinking," he said, "By 
one year after completing a pro-
gram, only 10 percent of reco-
vered alcoholics have remained 
abstinent; by two years, the fig-
ure drops to about I or 2 per-
cent," he said . 

There are an estimated 10 mil-
lion to J5 million Americans 
who are clinically considered to 
be alcoholics, The clinical diag-
nosis of alcoholism is based in 
part on the presence of social or 
physical problems related to 
alcohol. Social problems include 
whether alcohol has contributed 
to a penon havinllepl difficul-
ties, beinl fired from work or 
demoted, and being divorced or 
separated from a spou.e. Physi-
cal symptoms include blackoutl, 
tremors and withdrawals, 

For the study, data were 
generated in two stascs. Stale I 
cORlisted of 53 alcoholic men 
who Ihowed increases in blood 
test valuCi at a three-month 
follow-up after discharae from a 
four-week inpatient alcohol 
treatment program, Those data 
were used to generate a "decision 
rule" to determine whether a 
subject had returned to drinking, 
In Staae II, to test the validity of 
those results, the decision rule 
was applied to a second group of 
82 alcoholic men who were from 
the same propam. 

The researchen, found that 
the three tests used in combina-
tion can identify 95 percent of 
recovering alcoholics who resume

Ring Lardner Jr. recalls the era of 
blacklisting and the 'Hollywood Ten' 
By MARK KENNEY 
HJ.tllS W,ite, 

"I could answer that, but I'd hate 
myself in the morning." 

That was Ring Lardner Jr. 's reply to 
the question which changed his life and 
the lives of hundreds of other people in 
the years following the Second World 
War: "Are you now, or have you ever 
been, a member of the Communist 
Party?" When Lardner and nine other 
"unfriendly" witnesses were called 
before the House Un-American Activi-
ties Committee in 1947 and refused to 
answer that question, they found them-
selves convicted of contempt of Con-
gress, imprisoned and blacklisted. 

The blacklist was the subject of a talk 
given last Wednesday by Ring Lardner 
Jr., the Academy Award-winning writer 
of the film M·A·S·H. As one of the 
two surviving members of the original 
10 on the blacklist, Lardner provided 
his unique memories of one of America's 
most embarrassing eras. 

During the latter part of the 1 940s, 
the House Un- American Activities 
Committee was established to deter-
mine whether or not various people 
were guilty of "un-American activi-
ties ." This meant that anyone suspected 
of being a member of, or affiliated with, 
the Communist Party could be tried . 

According to Lardner, the possibility 
of the violent overthrow of the U.S. 
government through Communist infil-
tration was "entirely an idea conceived 
by the committee [HUAC] and [the) 
investigators. " 

Lardner said he joi ned the Holly-
wood Communist Party during the tur-
moil of the Great Depression. However, 
he added that "had I foreseen the future 
more accurately ... my political views 

on the First Amendment. Despite 
support from such Hollywood stars as 
Humphrey Bogart , Gene Kelly, Danny 
Kaye and John Huston, the witnesses 
were convicted of contempt of Congress 
and sent to prison for three-and-a-half 
years, and they soon found the movie 
studios completely unwilling to employ 
them. 

Many years later, after serving their 

prison terms and suffering through the 
blacklist, the Supreme Court appar-
ently held that all the witnesses had been 
within their rights. But, as Mr. L.rdner 
pointed out, "there are limits to the 
amount of consolation you can derive 
from this kind of delayed endorse-
ment." 

"You either take a stand or you're shit." 
-Ring Lardner, Jr. 

One of the 'Hollywood Ten' 

probably would have developed dif-
ferently ." 

Lardner and 10 other witnesses were 
called to testify on communist infil-
tration of the motion picture industry. 
Ten of the II witnesses, not all of whom 
were members of the Communist Party, 
made the decision to keep their political 
beliefs to themselves, basing their stance 

In the early 1950s a long series of 
HUAC witnesses, in order to avoid 
being blacklisted or charged with con-
tempt, or because they thought it was 
patriotic, named others as members of 
the Communist Party. In what Lardner 
called a "ritual," these people were 
asked to name other Communists, some 
of whose names the FBI had already

obtained from their own sources. In 
fact, Lardner said that he found the FBI 
kept better track of which left-wing 
groups he had joined than he did him-
self. 

Ring Lardner was able to survive the 
period of the blacklist - which lasted 
from his indictment in the late '405 until 
the early '6Os and came to include 
hundreds of people - only by writing 
scripts for television and movies under 
pseUdonyms. He found, he said, that 
"cashing a check made to a fictitious 
person was not a simple matter," and 
that he could not write many scripts 
under a single name, since he could not 
become so well known that producers 
might ask to meet him. 

The problems Lardner faced were not 
simply inconveniences. During one 
eight-month period, his only income 
was S 1,000 that he was paid to finish 
writing a screenplay. Yet he was better 
off than the "great majority [of writers 
who] couldn't find jobs after the black-
list was over because they weren't solidly 
enough established before it began," 
Lardner said. Hundreds of people 
named by "friendly" Committee wit-
nesses were unable to survive in the 
competitive Hollywood market because 
they had no recent credits when the 
blacklist finally ended. 

Ring Lardner gave filmmaker Otto 
Preminger much credit for helping bring 
an end to the blacklist. Preminger was 
the first person to publicly credit the 
blacklisted Dalton Trumbo for a script, 
an announcement Lardner says was 
"one of those moments where the right 

""~("(~d ~'"e 
wl'C k ~ he .. .l 

people come together under the right 
circumstances ... 

It was not until 1965 that Lardner's 
name finally appeared in the credits of a 
post-blacklist film, The Cincinatti Kid. 
Lardner said that by 1970 the nation's 
attitude had changed enough that he 
was invited to the Cannes Film Festival, 
a pleasant contrast to the days when he 
had been denied a U.S. passpon. 

Lardner showed few signs of bitter-
ness during his talk, although he men-
tioned with apparent incredulity Ronald 
Reagan's 1980 remark that there had 
never been a Hollywood blacklist. 
Lardner appeared to agree with Dalton 
Trumbo, whom he quoted as saying of 
the Committee witnesses that there were 
"no heroes or villians, only victims." 
Lardner added that he did not consider 
himself a hero because he felt he had 
had no choice but to stand up to the 
committee. His view, he said, was "you 
either take a stand or you're shit."

Volunteerism: working free of 
charge has its own rewards 
By MILES KAN 
St~Wrltn 

Philanthropy is coming back 
in style. Amid the BMW. and 
career-minded Yuppies oCtoday, 
more and more students are 
taking time out of their rigorous 
academic schedules to work free 
of charge. One realon for the 
increase in volunteerism is the 

less in San Diego or Tijuana to 
assisting a local business man-
aler in retail marketing. 

Accordinl to Libby Gilling-
ham, director of the Volunteer 
Connection, there are many 
benefits from helping others. 

"Students are becoming more 
aware of the opportunities in 
volunteering ... it's not just a 
charity service. Students get 

"It's important to do volunteer work 
so you don't go around with rose-
colored glasses ... it's good to ... work 
with people less fortunate than your-
self. " 

-Patrick Cotter 
UCSD student volunteer 

"Human Corps" law, which dic-
tates that all California college 
students are "expected to parti-
cipate" in 30 hours of volunteer 
service per academic year. 

UCSD student Patrick Cotter 
spends a few hours a week vol un-
teerinl at the North Coast Alz-
heimer's Center. Although some 
of the people there have memory 
problems due to the disease, they 
enjoy visits from the college volun-
teers, Cotter said. 

"It's really enjoyable and re-
wardinl ... I think it's important 
to do volunteer work so you 
don't go around with rose-col-
orcd Ilasses '" it's good to see 
things outside of a sheltered life, 
and to work with people less 
fortunate than yourself, "he said. 

something out of it also," she 
said. 

Gillingham said students can 
gain experience in a career-relat-
cd field, as well as develop many 
connections in that field. She 
gave examples of students who 
in the past have volunteered for 
hospitals, counseling centers, and 
legal clinics. 

Hoping to increase the number 
of student volunteers, California 
Assemblyman John Vascon-
cellos (D-San Jose) introduced 
the "Human Corps" bill which 

originally mandated that all 
California college students do 30 
hours of volunteer work per 
academic year. However, by the 
time it was signed into law by 
Governor Deukmejian in Sep-
tember 1987, it was changed from 
students are "required" to volun-
teer, to students are "expected to 
participate" in community ser-
vice. 

What the law does require is 
that each campus within the 
University of California and the 
California State University sys-
tems must develop a Human 
Corps task force. This task force, 
made of students, faculty, and 
administrators, is then required 
to monitor and help expand 
student volunteer services in the 
surrounding community. 

UCSD junior Susan Hylen 
volunteers at a local elementary 
school, tutoring a second Irade 
student, Tia . 

"The lirl I tutor comes from 
an unstable family ... I think it's 
important to help kids like Tia 
because not everyone has the 
same advantages and opportuni-
ties as I did when I was growing 
up," Hylen said. 

Since its beginning, the Volun-
teer Connection has taken an 
active role here at UCSD. Re-
cently, it held a campus-wide 
food drive in conjunction with 
the Graduate School Association 
to help feed runaway youths.

Cotter is now program coor-
dinator for the Volunteer Con-
nection at UCSD, a student-run 
organization which facilitates 
approximately 350 students a 
year in volunteering for com-
munity work. The Volunteer 
Connection was started in the 
summer of 1986, with the help of 
UCSD graduate Ellen Caprio 
and businessman Bob Choate. 
Through the Volunteer Connec-
tion, students can volunteer for' 
anything from helping the home-

mentary School. 

Because of its many projects. 
The Volunteer Connection con-
tinuously needs more student 
volunteers. Patrick Cotter noted 
that here at UCSD the study 
load often keeps people away. 

"People look at it as just one 
more thing to do. They say they 
just don't have the time ... but 
you can always find two hours a 
week." Cotter said . 

. It is predicted that there will 
be a great increase in the number 
of students volunteering across 
the nation. In Atlanta all public 
high school students are now 
required to perform 75 hours of 
community service before grad-
uation . According to an article 
in the Washinaton Post. this 
requirement. along with Califor-
nia's Human Corps law. indi-
cates what could be a nationwide 
change in the consciousness of 
students by which helpina others 
becomes an intearal part of 
education.

Softball 
Continued from pap 16 
but Bassi isn't too worried . 

"'We got a little experience 
with playing tough teams earlier 
this year at the Hayward Tour-
nament," Bassi said . 

Out of 16 teams participating 
in the tournament, 13 were Di,·-
ision II institutions. 

"'The teams we played were a 
cut above. We had a couple 
miscues in the games that cost us 
so hopefully we've learned from 
those mistakes," Bassi said . 

Even with the tough competi-
tion the Tritons finished the 
weekend with a 3-2-1 record 
overall , wh.ich proves they can 

handle the big time if they want 
to. 

Bassi is confident of a good 
showing at Regionals. "This team 
has a lot of guts and determina-
tion. The inexperience could be a 
factor but we're competitive. I'd 
predict it will be us and Central 
in the [Regional] finals ." 

Hurtt and other starter Stacy 
Sasaki will be the only pitchers 
used during the tournament. 
According to Bassi, stamina will 
not be a problem. 

"Patty and Stacy have pitched 
back-to-back doubleheaders 
before without problems. 
Besides, they'l be riding on 
adrenalin anyways so .I suspect 
there won't be any problems," 
Bassi said. 

As long as the young squad is 
able to minimize their errors in 

the field and if they can keep the 
offensive momentum they have 
been carrying all year, this squad 
could find themselves represent-
ing UCSD in the national tour-
nament next week . 

Men's

Continued from pale 16 
team also had a school-record. 
Seventeen swimmers qualify for 
this year's Nationals. 

Golf team gets bid 

Particiularly outstanding for 
the Tritons was Dave Saco who 
finished second in an excitingly 
close 1,6SO-yard freestyle final 
despite beating the previous 
national record by eight seconds. 
His time of 15:38.25 was good 
enough to qualify him for the 
Senior Nationals. 

Also qualifying for Senior 
Nationals was co-captain Kip 
Fulbeck who finished second in 
the SO-yard freestyle with a time 
of 20.89 seconds. 

Continued from pale 16 
ished as the no. 2 team in the 
nation each of the last three 
seasons. 

This year's 15th ranked Trit-
ons were only the fourth-best 
team in the district. According to 
coach Wydra, "Fourth-best in 
the district may not sound all 
that good, but I feel that all of 
the teams in our district could 
finish in the top five nationally." 

Although he is optimistic 
about his team's chances in 
national competition, he was 

distraught and just about con-
ceeded the number one spot to 
Cal State Stanislaus. 

"'In Division III golf, there are 
no scholarships given out to 
players due to NCAA rulings. 
Somehow Stanislaus gets around 
this rule by giving their players a 
specialtalent grant. "In myopin-
ion, all of their players are virtu-
ally on scholarships," coach 
Wydra said. 

Cal State Stanislaus has won 
the Nationals II of the past 14 
years and are heavily favored to 
repeat again this season. 

Leading point scorers for 
UCSD were Fulbeck (39), Saco 
(33), Co-captain Jeff Enright 
(24), Steve Denny (17) and Jason · 
Jance (14). Another school re-
cord set by this year's team was 
the fact that 16 team members 
qualified as All-Americans. 

Summing up this year's excep-
tional performance, Fulbeck 
called it the most "uplifting 
experience" he has had on the 
UCSD swim team.

Springtime at "Nationals 
Waterpolo Softball 
waiting for No.2 at 
ranking regionals 
By PHIL GRUEN 
Stl4lJ Writer 

Although the women's water 
polo team will not find out their 
exact seed for next weekend's 
National Tournament at the 
Naval Academy in Anapolis, 
Maryland until tomorrow, Head 
Coach Denny Harper neverthe-
less expects the team to receive a 
high placement. 

"I really didn't think we'd be 
doing as well as we are," Harper 
said.(The Tritons boast a 12-3 
record heading into tournament 
play.) "We've really improved 
over the last few weeks - I 
wouldn't be surprised if we are 
ranked either first or second." 

By JON A THAN SCHREYER

The Triton women's softball 
team joined a growing list of 
post-season participants as they 
received an invitation to partici-
pate in the 1988 Western Region-
als this weekend, May 13-IS, in 
Decorah Iowa. 

Harper ldentltied UC Davis as 
the other school which may 
receive the No.1 ranking. Other 
schools that will be competing in 
the three-day tournament, which 
begins Thursday and runs until 
Saturday, include UC Santa 
Barbara, Stanford, Cal Poly San 
Luis Obispo, Brown, Bucknell, 
UC Irvine and (no joking here) 
Slippery Rock State from Penn-
sylvania. 

The women 's waterpolo team will need tough offense to ·survive against national competition. 

UCSD will enter the four-
team, double elimination tour-
nament ranked No. 2 behind 
Central College of Iowa. Al-
though the first team the Tritons 
will play is unknown at the 
moment, Co-head Coach Lisa 
Bassis assumes UCSD wil face 
the No.3 ranked St. Thomas 
College of Minnesota. Luther 
College is the fourth team to 
make the regional contest. 

Interestingly enough, Harper 
pointed out that Slippery Rock 
State is one of the schools that 
depends primarily upon their 
defensive performance. So far 
this year, it has been their defense 
just may be ranked among the 
top . four in the country. The 
schools will find out their seeds 

today. 
The success of the women's 

water polo team this weekend 
that has enabled them to rise to 
victory in all but three of their 
games - and the losses were 
against club teams, not other 
schools. 

"We're definitely a defensive 

ball club," Harper said. "Hope-
fully, [Triton goalie] Jeffi Paulsen 
can perform this weekend as well 
as she's been performing all year." 

The relatively young Triton 
squad has had little experience in 
post-season play since 1985. 
Seniors Patty Hurtt (starting 
pitcher) and Danny Goodlett 
(third baseman) are the only ones 
on this year's staff who have 
experienced the pressures of 
regional play. This experience 
could affect the Tritons' chances 

Steenkamer shoots hole-in-one 

The Tritons, who won the 
tournament in '86 but finished 
sixth last year, are led offensively 
by Lillian Lathrop, Kristen lar-
sen, and Carin Crawford. la-
throp is the Tritons' leading 
scorer this season. See SOFTBALL, pale 14 

Men's track sets two 
more Triton records 

By MIKE U'REN 
Stl4l1 Writer 

Joost Steen kamer, the Tritons 
number one player and AlI-
American each of the last two 
seasons, shot a hole-in-one on a 
I 76-yard, 17th hole of North 
Torrey Pines golf course last 
weekend against Redlands. 

Steenkamer finished with a 71 
over the 18-hole course but the 
Tritons still fell to the Bulldogs 
299-303. 

Nationals 

Right behind Steenkamer were 
Brad Shupe who shot 76, Dan 
Young and Shawn Newbold who 
each shot 78. Fritz Reber shot a 
78, and Mike Reinhardt shot a 
79, but those scores were dropped 
because only the five lowest 
scores are used for the final tally. 

Last week, the Triton golf team 
rt!ceived a pleasant surprise. 

when invitations to the Na-
tionals were given out the 15th 
ranked Tritons received only one 
bid and that was for Steenkamer 

Men's swimming takes 
third place in Atlanta 
national tournaDlent 

By MIKE FOLEY 
Stfl/, Writer 

March 17-19, while the rest 
of UCSD was struggling 
through finals week , the 
UCSD men's swim team was 
ha ving its best showing ever in 
the NCAA Division III Na-
tional Championships held in 
Atlanta, Georgia. UCSD fin-
ished third out of a field of 
about 80 teams, only one point 
behind arch-rival Claremont-
Mudd. Kenyon College was 
the national champion for the 
ninth consecutive year. 

The competition for econd 
place came down to the meet's 
final race: the 4 x 100 freestyle 

relay. In front of a boisterous 
crowd of about SOO people, 
UCSO won the race, but 
Claremont finished second 
enabling them to hold on to 
their slim lead for second 
place . Unfortunately, the 
Tritons did not have any div-
ers go to Nationals who could 
have increased UCSD's point 
total. 

Going into the meet UCSD 
had been rated No.5 in Div-
ision III by Swim World 
magazine so their showing at 
the Nationals meant UCSD 
swimmers had an outstanding 
meet. 

Not only did the men's swim

to compete individually. 
After further review, all ofthe 

Triton members were given at-
large berths and will be compet-
ing in the Nationals from May 
17-20 in Greensboro, North 
Carolina. 

Coach Mike Wydra is pleased 
with UCSO's recent at-large bid. 
After losing the no. I player in 
the nation, Pat Weishen, to gra-
duation last year, it is difficult to 
continue to be successful.

Pole vaulter Rick Harper and 
middle-distance runner Tim Val-
lez both set new UCSD records 
in their respective events at a 
meet in Point Loma on Satur-
day. Their achievements quali-
fied them for the Division III 
National meet which will be held 
in Northfield, Minnesota from 
May 24-28. 

Harper and Vallez join long-
distance runner Denise McFay-
den (I ,SOO and 3,000) and shot-
putter / discus-thrower Shannon 
Quigley to place a total of four 
UCSD athletes in the Nationals. 
Saturday'S meet, held at Point 
Lorna, was a non-scoring meet 
which also featured competitors 
from Point Lom , Occidental, 
Redlands, Claremont and Po-
mona-Pitzer. 

Harper's clearance of 1ST' 
coupled with Vallez's I :51.88 time 

in the 800-meter run not only 
qualified both athletes for the 
Nationals, but marked the 16th 
and 17th times this season that a 
UCSD track record hal been 
broken. 

"We're really pleased to have 
four qualifaers lor th~ Nationals 
already," track Coach Mark 
Stanforth said. "With our last 
meet coming up at Occidental, 
we hope to place a few more." 

According to Stanforth, in-
cluded among those who have 
"good chances" of placing are 
Gisele English in the I,SOO, 
Sabrina Jensen in the 3,000, Greg 
Ronlov in the pole vault (he and 
Harper have been neck and neck 
all year), and Kevin Carter in the 
men's I,SOO. Vallez will also try 
to qualify in the 1,500 next Sat-
urday at the Occidental meet. 
The top eight competitors in 
each event at the Nationals will 
achieve All-American status.
