1bIdeat. as an answer to radical 
joaruII, tile Triton 'nmea evolved

AI IUCb, we CmTY quite a few

Is another matter. 

We trJ DOW; we've tried in the 
put. lArd Imowa we have. But 
u.e have been times wben we've 
faDed in our "official" role. When 
we baven't covered a story we 
Ihould bave .. When we've done 
Inc.omplete jobs on stories covered. 
When we've decided, on a rare 
occasion, to study one night Instead 

~ going that ema bit for the 
paper. 

And wben you have as visible a 
media source as ours, it's open to 
criticlam. All sorts of it. A campus 
newspaper in almost all cases 
can't win. It "never" has the news 
you want to read. But If that's what 
you think, then realize that It's only 
a reflection upon the product -
upon the school - upon you. As the 
editor of the UC Santa Barbara 
Ddy Nena put it, " If we're 
boring, so are you." 

We're "OpeD" 
We're open to story ideas. Just 

try us. And suggestions. Try 
putting them in our new suggestion 
box (i.e. manilla folder ). If the 
sideline critics will specify where 
they feel we're at fault, instead of 
mouthing vague generalizations, 
we'll listen. And it wouldn't hurt, 
both in ego gratification and in 
keeping our rudders steered in the 
right direction, if we get kudos for 
things well done.

that we've been perfect - DOt by a 
long sbot. SImply beca\lle we, 
some students, have been putting 
out a pubHcation every Monday, 
. Wednesday ,and Friday. 

We - who clon't have a jour-
nallam department, or anytblng 
vaguely reaembl1nC one. 

We - who have no "advlaon." 
We - whose monetary support ... 
Well, let me draw this picture 

more carefully for you. In 1974 the 
Triton TImes received ~,OOO from 
Reg. Fee for publiahing. We 
reduced our administration 
dependence to a figure of $22,000 in 
19'15. In trying to go "independent" 
this last year (i.e. making It on our 
own, having little or no dependence 
on the admiJdatration ' or anyone) 
we Incnrred losses of $14,000. Then, 
as now, dollars were stretched, 
students underpaid, their 
dedication to the paper the only 
thing making it worthwhile to 
them. 

No Mooey 
But now, for this new publishing 

year, 1977-78, we are getting no 
monetary fWMJa. Zero. The UCSD 
Associated Students Council 
decided not to even give us "back-
up" money. The total amount of 
administration money we're 
getting is $7500 from Chancellor 
McElroy to publish the two page 
calender every Monday. And that's 
all, folks . 

Think long about the statement, 
"The Triton Times is an ad-
ministration mouthpiece ." Makes 
sense, doesn't it? Like a snow plow 
business in La Jolla. We have no 
reason to be anything but ob-
jective. As for the rest of the 
rumors which permeate over the 
workings of this paper, on · the 
whole they hold about as much 
credence as the aforementioned. 
None at all. 

This paper, in the past, has had 
its bonehead moments. You might 
have heard of our infamom; "April 
Fools" issue . In the spring of 1974 a 
bogus front page was printed on 
April first , with such phony stories 
as "Shockley Named New Provost 
of Third College." Naturally, it 
drew much adverse reaction. But 
those who claim that the "same" 
spirit and people are in the Triton 
Times today speak from 
ignorance. It seems there's been 
plenty of that going around. Last 
year's paper, and of course this

going to make us or break us. 
We've had an excellent summer 
getting advertising contracts. But 
now, we, the Triton Times, have to 
ask something of you in return. 

PATRONIZE OUR

Be prepared to bear this 
constant drum beat. It wlll come 
often during the year. We will try 
to insure our own survival. Be 
undentaDdiDg wben you lee a. ad-
beaVy Dewspaper. Also koow that 
we're not in a position to refuse 
ads. We ask you to go out of your 
way to seek those who advertise 
their products in this paper. It will 
help us a lot if you say you saw the 
ad in the IT. As for those that 
don't advertise , tell them that they 
should. For you and us. For in 
pursuing advertising contracts our 
summer ad people have attempted 
to seek out those products and 
services students can use. Just 
open the paper , look at the ads, and 
even benefit by the discounts 
given. 

If w~ earn enough mOl)ey it 
follows that we'll be able to im-
prove oW' product. You will benefit 
in the long run by better stories, 
and better lay~ut. By a wider 
range of things covered. With 
enou~ revenue we will be able to 
do things like take Classified Ads 
more hours than 11-3. We'll be able 
to alleviate some of the flak, im-
possible to avoid, that bas been 
directed at us . And in the end we 
might be able to achieve our 
ultimate goal of independence 
(free atlast... ). 

But unless you help us, which 
includes trying to understand some 
of our problems and limitations, 
there will come the day, and soon, 
when you 'll have nothing to 
criticize every Monday, Wed-
nesday, and Friday.

McElroy: Time to N\ake 
UCSD a Great University 

With pleasure I welcome our new 
and returning students to uc San 
otego for this school year. It has 
been thirteen years since the flrst 
undergraduates enrolled bere, and 
with eacb year the University has 
grown in academic stature and 
sense of community. 

Although many students will 
notice a number of physical im-
IX'Ovements and additional faculty, 
all of us should understand that our 
prevlOUII rapid growth phase has 
about ended. We are in effect 
entering a new era In the short 
history of our campus.' With DlO8t 
expansion behind III, we can now 
concentrate increased attention to 
ideas and attitudes which make a 
truly great university. 

In the Ideal, a university Is an 
academic community. It is 
academic because a university is a 
place where sophisticated learning 
takes place and new knowledge is 
created and explored. It is a 
community because everyone has 
some conunon purpose, everyone 
is united In a search for a more 
precise understanding. 

Its I said, this is the ideal. And 
like any ideal there is always a gap 
between that and the realitY of 
everyday experiences. To so many 
students the university is a for-
midable place, more a series of 
obstacles than a satisfying ex-
perience . To so many the 
university is simply a way station 
in life , simply a four year interlude 
between high school and a career. 

This is the appropriate time for 
all of us to make a more conscious 
effort to build a superior sense of 
campus conununity. It is time for 
the campus to aettle in, to develop 
some deeper attaclunents, greater 
services, and a more comfortable, 
personalized atm08pbere. BuUdlng 

... 
a better campus environment will 
enormously help both the 
academic and social climate whicb 
enables all of us to perform better 
ana live a fuller life. 

How does one go about this? 
After giving first priority to 
learning, I hope each of you will 
participate in some aspects ~ 
campus life . There Is a wealth ~ 
activities and institutions on the 
campus that cannot help but be 
better with greater Interest and 
student participation. With your 
initiative, our campus can become 
more lively and' more Interesting, 
with civility and genUeness to all, 
to the end of achieving a close 
approximation of the Ideal 
academic conununity .

(ZNS)-Are you ready for men to 
breast feed babies? 

Doctor Robert Greenblatt of the 
Georgia Medical School has told a 
medical symposium in Min· 
neapolis that all that is needed for 
men to produce milk is "enough 
stimulation . " 

According to the doctor, the 
necessary stimulation can be 
obtained by a baby's sucking at a 
man's nipples for several weeks. 

Greenblatt, quoted in The 
Philadelphia Inquirer, also says 
that drugs are available which can 
turn men into breastleeders. He 
says these drugs overcome the 
same honnone inhibitors that 
prevent women who have never 
been pregnant from producing 
milk.

Knowing how to study is a skill 
tJJat must be mastered should you 
desire to fInlsh the race and 
graduate from this fine and 
esteemed institution. But, for in-
coming fresimum, green around 
the pocket calculator, they must 
rely on basic high school skills 
because no advice is given on this 
matter during orientation - at least 
not when I went through it all . In 
my orientation we learned wbere 
all the buildings were and all the 
various options extant for fuHilling 
the Humanities requirement, but 
no one told me the tricks of the 
trade. And unless you are given an 
Wlconunonly keen orientation 
leader the agony that is midtenns 
and finals remains a mystery . 

So I come to you in this casual 
narrative voice for the purpose of 
giving you freshmen out there 
some helpful hints. But before I do 
that you must understand the 
philosophy of education here. 
Roger Revelle recently stated that 
"learning how to learn" was the 
primary objective of Revelle 
College and, I would assume of all 
of the colleges, albeit with different 
approaches. Now that sounds nice 
yet It rarely happens. When 
Revelle's statement · does come 
true it is usually because of the 
unique talents of an iconoclastic 
professor who conveniently 
disappean Ilke an unsolvable 
deadend in a Jay War cartoon. 
BaslcaUy the thing to watcb for is 
something Jolm M. Mason said: 
"The aim of education should be to 

. convert the mind into a living 
fountain, and not a reservoir. That 
which is filled by merely pumping 
in, will be emptied by pumping 
out. " 

Pumping in and pwnping Out. 
They pwnp in and we later pwnp 
out. The pwnping out is something 
that will happen regardless of the 

~lity of education, but to what 
degree It happens depends on you. 

It's the pumpmg In tbat I'm here to 
taJkabout. • 

How does one survive the 
pumplDC In? Survival is .mat 
COURts, you know, So lets get down 
to It and adcIra the problem by 
grouplnga. 

Meet tile ProcrutIutor 
1) The Procrastinator. The 

procruUnator is one who believes 
that one should, ''never do today 
what one can put off till 
tomorrow ," aad is an eumple of 
someone trying to minimAze the 
time between pumping and 
pumplDC out. Should you desire to 
find such a person simply tum your 
head from side to side and chances 
are you will see one, but generally 
(for the perfectionist) you can 
catch one by listening for, "I'm 
already a week behind and it's only 
the second day of classes," or by 
going to a party a coupie of days 
before a midtenn. 

Those of you who insist upon this 
precarious way of life need one or 
all of the following : coffee, a 
television, and a friend (preferably 
a roommate) who knows more 
tJ)an you do on the subject being 
pursued. For those who loathe 
coffee but have maHunctioning 
tastebuds (something that will 
occur in the cafeteria anyway) I 
recommend Morning Thunder Tea 
which has flfty-six per cent more 
caffeine than coffee ; a must for the 
"all Righter." Yes, Tom Snyder 
and you will become close friends , 
which leads to the reason for the 
television. The television (or as my 
friends and I call it , the Mommy 
Mammary. Slurp!) will keep you 
company, The TV will fill the void 
with junk and it will be good, The 
TV will care for you while the 
others sleep. Besides, something 
has to keep your friend occupled 
while he awalts the clarion call for 
help which usually follows a 
"arty, ''Oh,*ftl'' 

SIould all of this fail and you 
come to the conclusion tJJat you 
have procrastinated too long, then 
I recommend the stand-by~bbit­
out-of-the-bat extension which 
necessitates a visit to your prof or 
ta whereby a little white lie grants 
you a few more hours to live. And 
with those few more hours you 
should run like Ben Gazzara to a 
ta, to the Writing Clinic, to Oasis , 
or to a better friend . The key is, get 
help. Generally wtlen the pumping 
in process is accomplished on a 

one-on~e basis, rather than a 
one-on three-hundred, the pumping 
out process is less spontaneous,

Where A "B" Is A SID 
Z) The "A" Student. With the 

absence of the super jock and the ' 
need to delve into classes such as 
underwater basketweavlng let 
move to the opposite extreme ani 
discuss what is deprecatingly 
called the ' 'Durd,'' which ~cme 
believe stands for "normal un-
dergraduate Revelle dipshit," 
sometIKng that is no doubt,spurious 
and profligate. Often, when 
strivipg for an "A" in a class, 
someone who is short of that ar· 
tificial de~ (the sodiwn nitrite 
of Academia) will gripe about 
"tholle damned pnHlleds are 
jacking up the curve." These same 
people will use the phrase " nurd 
out" apologetically to convey the 
fact that shelhe must actually sit 
down to study as if studying were a 
crime. The procrastinator is often 
such a culprit but then so is the 
"A" student who feels that in order 
to get by he/she must adopt the 
well-how-did-I-do-that attitude 
toward his perfect record. 

Here, the pumping in process is 
being attacked ' from an external 
source • other students. The "A" 
student wants to maximize the in 
process and the rest of his class 
mates would like to do the opposite, 
for him. Add all this to a stunted 
social life. Since the "A" student 
hardly requires help from your 
humble narrator in matters of 
studying, I will attempt to aid him 
or her in the social realm. You can 
always draw pap from the Mommy 
Mammary or go see a movie, but 
there are other options. There are 
many plays ~d recitals to go to as 
well as parties (the few that exist 
here) . And then there's always ...

traveling for the year and you're

Let \II pause for a moment to

let's start taUdng about Christmas

Premature fantasies? Hardly! 
Fall quarter is only ten weeks long. 
U you plan on doing any traveling 
in December, start thinking about 
it 1I00I1. For many airline tickets 
(}lawall, for example) reser-
vations must be made weD in 
advance. Reservations, naturaDy, 
require c()mmitments. Com-
mitments, furthermore, are the 
end product of thought and con-
sideration. 

Winter break, incidentaDy,is an 
ideal time to travel. UCSD lets out 

in ....., December, so there are 
about two weeks of vacation time 
before tile annual Ouiatmaa rush.

Travel ideas are often available 
within the university . The 
department of your major may 
offer educational traveling 
programs, with unit credits a 
possibility. The SId Club usually 
gets together for a "slope ex-
travaganza" a couple of times 
during the year. This year, a group 
of Uamstudents, upon completion 
of finais , are heading down to

under the law. "The Supreme 
Court, in the Bakke case, is face to 
face with the equal protection 
clause of the Fourteenth Amen-
dment," said Colvin and Llnlt. UC, 
appealing the declaion in a June 7 
brief, said there is "no substitute 
for the use of race as a factor in 
admissions if professional schools 
are to admit more than an isolated 
few applicants from minority 
groups ." The carter ad-

(]WOles Schwartz, political radical

pulsory disclosure of blL1iness 
interests by UC officials and 
researchers, asked Aug. 29 for a 
legislative inquiry into the former 
corporate involvement of UC Vice 
President James B. Kendrick, Jr. 
For five years, until earlier this 
year, Kendrick served on the board 
of directors of Tejon Agricultural 
Corp., while simultaneousiy ser-
ving as UC vice president of 
agricultural sciences. Schwartz 
had originally sought an inquiry by 
UC President David Saxon in May, 
but was denied. Kendrick resigned 
earlier this year saying"that his 
service to the ranching corp. in-
volved "no circumstances to in-
dicate a conflict of interest," while

Schwartz said the inatance "looks 
like a stellar case of university 
service in agriculture being 
directed for the benefit of large 
landowners and rich investors, at 
the cost of small farmers and 
farm workers , taxpayers and 
consumers." 

EBergy Saving 
... UC scientists David Goldstein 

and Robert Oear, of Lawrence 
Berkeley Laboratory, released a 
report in Auguat which guides 
shoppers to energy saving and 
dollar efficient appliances. 
Goldstein said that excess monthly 
operating costs of some inefficient 
refrigerators, stoves, air con-
ditioners and freezers could 
amount to three times the pur-
chasing cost durtng the llfeUme of 
the product. Goldstein and Oear 
pointed out that more expensive 
appliances may prove to conserve 
energy and money in the long run. 

.:.The UC Board of Regents 
adopted a resolution July 15 which 
calls the 1977-78 Budget Act 
language "an unconstitutional 
infringement on the full powers of 
organization and government of 
the university." The Regents 
expressed strong disapproval of 
legislative intrusion on the con-
stitutional independence of UC, 
and Regents Chairman William 
Coblentz said a special committee 
had been appointed to review the 
status of university automony and 
its relation to the goverrunent of 
California.

Also, with any luek, it will be fairly

Punk Rock 
Scratchin' the Surface, located 

on University and Goldfinch, is a 
small, but very impressive record 
shop. Looking at it from the front. 
it is hard even to find the place. But 
inside there is a unique selection of 
new and used records - most of 
which aren't available anywhere 
else in San Diego. (It's the only 
place where you can find copies of 
the Sex Pistol's "God Save the 
Queen," although the management 
hates to admit it. ) The owner is 
very knowledgable and quite 
outspoken about his musical 
tastes. 

The condition of the records 
imide are usually very good. The 
price range here is from $.50 to 
$2.00 fol' used records. Highly 
recommended. Their business 
phone is 295-1267.

a good bay wID appear on the 
raca, but for tbe most part, theee 
finds are snatched up by the people . 
working tMrt. 

Anotber bad feature about 
Arcade is that their records aren't 
alphabetized. Usually, record 
stores will at least try to keep their 
records in order. But at Arcade you 
will find yourself searcb1ng for 
hours, only to find yourself looking 
at the same copies of Metal 
Machine Musak. It's too bad, 
really. Maybe they should change 
their name to Licorice PIzza. It 
could only help business. 

Most (not all) records are 
guaranteed bere. Prices for each 
record do not exceed $1.98. There is 
a good selection of &-track tapes 
here . Their business phone is 23t-
8856 or 22S-81156. 

Folk Arts is located on 3111 
Adams Avenue. Don't corne here if 
you just like rock or jazz : they 
won 't have it. Instead, Folk Arts is 
a treasure bin for folk, bluegrass 
and blues collectors. And wbat 
they do have is a very good 
selection of tapes and records, 
incbxling many hours of old radio 
shows. (The tape catalogues are 
inches thick). 

The family which runs the shop 
is very knowledgeable In the 
musical field and service here is, 
happily , very personal. They are 
all very honest, and will not mark 
an out~fllrint record unless it 
really is out of print and hard to 
find.

'lbe RadIo Sback on Silverado 
Drive is pert..- the cloIIeIt used 
record store by UCSD. The records 
that tbia store carries are neatly 
stacked in the back comer ~ the 
store, almost Invialble In the shade. 
There, you will flndabout l~bins of 
records, all of which are used. A 
little shuffling through and you will 
find some decent used reco,rds, 
though many of them look a bit 
worn. 

The main disadvantage to 
buying in this shop is the attitude of 
the owner. Not only do these 
records have II() type of guarantee, 
but the owner also won't let them 
be played. ("If I let you hear 'em. 
everybody else will want to hear 
'em too.") Price r~e : $2.00 per 
disc . 

Probably the best way to 
describe Flip Side is that it was 
what Aracde used to be. Located on 
4641 College Ave., this shop has a 
fairly good selection of used 
records, most in alphabetical 
order. The condition ranges from 
good to very good , but the 
management won't offer to play 
anything for you to determine 
surface noise. No guarantee here 
either. 

While you are over there, you 
might want to check out Monty's 
Rockers, located just a few blocks 
away . The price range for Flip Side 
is around $2.00. Business phone : 
287-8018. Good listening.

Words by Other- Names: ~tIa~~~e7 you get it , take your worst classes irt your Junior year (if that is possible aroWld here ) otherwise 
your senior year may be quite 
depressing. Another route is the 
increasingly popular fifth year as a 
senior - if you have the money. 
Your best bet is to stick it out till 
the end and get what you.want out 
of the classes. I know that is not 
saying much but that is the only 
answer short of dropping out. 

And I do not mean tt imply that 
there are only three types of 
students . Sorry , but that is too 
rational . The jock does exist as 
does the partygoer (your basic 
sybarite ). You will note the ab-
sence of the radical, alas. The 
Media likes to push the idea that 

w~ are a stoner generation, that we 
get too high to care, but that is a 
liWe too simplistic. But it may 
have something to do with what 
Tolstoi said about the "snare of 
preparation." At any rate many of 
these categories can be mhed or 
changed to suit the individual. For

Notes Oegin 
Anew as Music 
Season Opens 

" Who is Sidney Harth?" 
"He is a fine violinist and con-

ductor, an active participant in 
chamber music, and one of the 
outstanding soloists of the IJl Jolla 
Civic /University Symphony's 
upcoming season," answers 
Glenna Hazelton, the Symphony's 
concert committee chairperson. 

Harth, who will be heard in the 
Beethoven Violin Concerto with 
Thomas Nee, the orchestra's 
music director , is that rare 
commodity - a total musician. 
Since his appointment as con-
certmaster and associate con-
ductor of the Los Angeles 
Phiihannonic, Harth has been 
a ppreciated by critics and 
audiences as one of the city's milst 
versatile perfonners. He is, as the 
New Yorker 's Winthrop Sargeant 
remarked, "more than a violinist ; 
he is an a rtist. " 

Premiere Concerts 
The premiere concerts on 

November 12 and 13 at the Man-
deville Auditorium will feature 
pianist Tamas Ungar of the UCSD 
faculty in the " Third Piano Con· 
certo" of Bartok . Guest conductor 
Zoltan Rozsnyai , who will lead the 
orchestra, has received acclaim 
for his appearances with several of 
the world's leading orchestras, 
including the New York 
PhilharmoniC , the Cleveland 
Orchestra, the Vienna Symphony, 
and the Philhannonic Hungarlca 
of which he is founder. RmlInyai 
will round out the November 
program with three repertory 
favorites - "The Water Music" by 
Handel, Debussy's " Mternoon of a 
Faun" and Lizst's " Les Preludes. " 

This season, under the leader-
ship of David Chase, patrons ·will 
get the chance to hear the La Jolla 
Civic/University Orchestra and 
Chorus in three concerts especially 
programmed to offer ' a wide 
variety of choral works. 

The first, on December 3 and 4 at 
St . James by the Sea Episcopal 
OIurch, will feature the Bach 
"Magnificat" and church OIlIanist

Computer Music Concerts 

Preparations are continuing for 
the 1977 International Computer 
Music Conference to be held on the 
UCSD Campus from Oct. 26 
through 30. Previous conferences 
were held at Michigan State in 
1974, the University of Dlinois in 
1975 and at the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology in 197&. 

The theme m this year's con-
ference is Computer Music 
Composition and Performance. 
The conference will have both 
technical and non-technical 
sessions and will feature two 
concerts of computer music. Non-
technical sessions will focus on 

real~ interaction with com-
puters (performance and com-
position, psychoacoustics and 
psychology, musical access to 
systems) and the aesthetics and 
philosophy of computer music. 
Technical topics will include 
analysis/synthesis techniques, 
hybrid techniques and digital 
sound recording and editing.

religious, classical and pop~ 
Olicano music as found in various

Students will have the chance to 
participate in the activities and 
aspirations of the larger Chicano 
conununity in the San Diego area. 

The course promises to be a rare, 
invaluable experience since 
Professor Riedel is one of the most 
eminent authorities in his field. 
Before emigrating to the US, 
Riedel was active in Equador in 
the performance of classical 
music, the arrangement of 
Ecuadorian folk music for large 
choruses, and the arrangement of 
popular Latin American music for 
the largest record factory there. 

Amongst his many university 
conunittee assignments, he has 
chaired the Conunittee on Latin

by Debbie Schwartz 
CoatribuUog Editor 

As man continues in his 
evolutionary development; his 
awareness and understanding 
of the world become more and 
more sophisticated. Science and 
tectmology have hastened the 
evolutionary pace in the 
twentieth century, contributing 
to changes in perception and 
conception . 

Within this context, the 
boundaries of the realm of 
artistic expression are ex-
panding and becoming en-
meshed with other fields . Many 
artists are incorporating 
photography, music, video, and 
dramatic perfonnance into 
their artistic endeavors 'and 
finding them to be excellent 
modes of self-expression. 

Many of these artists are also 
encountering problems in

musewns are falling behind in 
their attempts to "house" 
contemporary art. 

In response to these 
problems, a group of San Diego · 
artists are combining their 
efforts in the direction of new 
possibilities and conceivable 
solutions. The United Artists 
Coalition (UAC) was recently 
formed as a means of com-
munication among artists and 
with the public. 

Its members include actors,

Most of the planting which 
turned a vacant lot into a scenic 
attraction took place around the 
turn of the century, and was 
supervised by Kate O. Sessions, 
who in 1935 was named the 
"mother of Balboa Park." The 
park was named for Vasco Nui'iez 
de B8Iboa, a Spanish explorer 
credited with claiming the Pacific 
Ocean for his country, In 1910.

A trip to the park should ideally 

start in the morning, because of the 
sheer volume of things to do and 
see there. At least leave yourself 
several hours for the visit. 

There are several ways to get 
there. By bus from UaiD, take the 

30 or 34 downtown, then traMfer to 
the 7, which goes by the Park. By 
car, take Highway 5 south to 163 
.north, then foUow the signs to the 
park. U there are no open spaces in 
the first parking lot you come to, go 
to the second, and so on. Be

latter, since they give the park its 
true charm, make it a unique place 
in San Diego. 

Some of the special events are 
scbeduled . The San Diego 
Repertory Theatre, for instance, 
stages regular short plays in Zorro

Theatre) on weekends. The playa 
are free and very entertaining; the 
RepeItDry Theatre is a weD known 
act.i.nl ·· iJ'oup, and their Balboa 
Park ~ys are usually funny and 
mildly satirical. 

Other special events are more 
irregularly scheduled, but no less 
entertaining. As you sit admiring 
the aceaery outside the Botanical 
Gardea a two-person acting troupe 
migbt set up stage on the grass 
nest to Ibe Lily Pond, usinI a box 
to define their stage, and act out a 
short scene or two. Or a modern-
day mialtrel migbt sit down by the 
Fine Arts Gallery, play his guitar 
and barmonica and sing an old 
Dylan time. Or a strugling young 
mime might begjn his special

Another popular attraction is the 
Natural HIstory Musuem, (free 
admission on Wednesday), which 
is filled with exhibits of animals, 
birds, and reptiles, focusing on 
those indigenous to tlle local area. 
Activities operating out of the 
museum Include Saturday nature 
walks, Sunday educational films 
and regular nature lectures . 
Groups Uke the Sierra Qub and the

A special brancb of the GaUery is 
the Timken Art Gallery. The ex-
pressed aim of tbe Timken 
directors is to display the works 01 
the old masters in as perfect a 
condition as possible. It is divided 
into four interior wings, housing 
French, F1emish, Spanisb and 
Ualian works. 

Other regular park attractions 
are the Aerospace Museum and the 
Sports Hall or Olampions. The 
former focuses on the history of 
one of San Diego's foremost in-
dustries, the aeroepace industry, 
while the latter features exhibits 
on local sports figurea, past and 
present. 

The park is also heme for two 
fonns of nationally known en-
tertainment - the Old Globe

~ove you Heard the One About... 

Try Q Change of Pace From UCSD: Laughter 
By AIu RuleD 

F'.dItIr 
Have you beard the one abou~ 

complaininl VCSD students who 
say, "Tbere's DO night life in San 
Diego." 

U'sooJoke. 
But relief is here, in town, and 

it's not spelled R~L-A-I-I).S. 
Try the Comedy Store on 916 

Pearl Street. 
Fonnerly located - In Pacific 

Beach, the Q)medy Store moved to 
La Jolla in August because of the 
need of a more spacious setting. I 
had beard glowing reports from 
friends who had previously seen 
the soows, comments ranging from 
''it's great," to "you don't stop 
laughing." But ODe thing prevented 
me from going - age. I wasn't 
twenty one. Time healed that. 

So with four friends I ventured 
down Into the w1lds rl La JoUa. We 
chose the eight thirty show as 
opposed to the eleven thirty one. 
Get there early - there reaDy 
aren't any bad seats, but it's more 
fun feeling the comedian right "on 
top of you," and, if courting a 
masochistic desire, you do get 
singled out for insults. Admission 
Is $3 on weeknights and $4 on 
weekends with a minimum two 
drink purchase. 

'!be Immortalized Comics 
Inside, walking over red carpet, 

one takes In the portraits of famous 
comics hanging on the walls. In 
stride, you start throwing out the 
lines the people are famous for, 
such personages as Laurel and 
Hardy, the Man Bros., w.e. 

. Fields, Mae West, and others. 
Stained glass, and of course piano, 
add to the decor. 

The seating conditions, as in 
most similar establishments. are 
crowded. This doesn't detract from 
the show though, unless you knock 
over someone's drink. Tbe 
proximity of people, the happy 
expectancy, and the scattered 
laughter and conversation only add 
to, as one friend put it, "The Las 
Vegas Atmosbpere." 

The crowd, basically a young 
one, comes to the establishment 

ready to laugh. Everyone waita to 
celebrate life. In the meantime 
cIrinQ are served. One in our party 
ordered a ''plain daqulrl," and 
when the waltress came and 
handed him an empty glass by 
mistake, he said, "I guess this is a 
very plain daqulri." 

The festive air spurs on aU 
amateur comecHans. UWe Jokes 
pass around your table and the 
ones around you. It's Uke the 
priming rl the pump; you start 
with a few Utters before you're 
able to do the beUy-laughs. ThIs 
trend Is furthered by the pianist; 
performing not to out~o the acts, 
but just to start things along. He 
mentions San Diego women, our 
table starts applauding, causes the 
audience to clap, then be pounds 
out a few chords. Until-it's time. 

The Show Starts 
Larry Himmel, the m.c. for the 

night, best known in San Diego as a 
KGB ~ jockey, started off the 
show with some routines of his 
own. Was he good? After he 
finished, two friends turned to me 
and said, "1bat was worth the 
admission price alone." 

And it was . 
The thing that strikes you 

initially with the performances is 
the "no holds barred." The 
average person is used to the 
Carson innuendo, the David 
Bremer aUusion, the Steve Martin 
unspoken line. Right away in these 
acts the four-letter words start 
flying. Nothing is holy. Sexual and 
drug references are"common. 

And the performers. The comics. 
For our evening we witnessed a 
potpourri of talent, their diverse 
acts not encroaching upon one 
another, but complimentary-. 
Charlie Hill, an Indian, used his 
background and insights to play on 
ethnic (a tenn he doesn't ap-
preciate) hwnor. Demy Johnston, 
using impersonation talent, was 
hilarious in doing his little 
vignettes of personalities. Skip 
Stephenson, going to some extent 
the Don Rickles route, kept the 
audience wary with his acid 
tongue. And Gallagher, through

sheer zaniness, made the crowd, 
laugh. 

There was not one bad act. There 
were four excellent acts. This was 
the consensus of our table and the 
audience. Tbe comics were 
seasoned, knew their stuff, 
veteraos of numerous per-
formances and television shows. 

ManIpulated By Experts 
As an audience, we couldn't help 

but be drawn into the hands of 
these experts. You watch, a silent 
(except when laughing) partner of 
their fantasies, their words. You 
hang on punch lines you already 
know-and still laugh. They, as 
consummate actors, put on short 
stage productions of delicate 
timing, and material that must be 
handed Just so. On that night they 
succeeded almost Oawlessly. They 
could tell you about other nights 
though.

H.E.L.P.~t. from Page 4 

The program Provides students 
with opportunities to learn about 
health careers by participation and 
observation in units in University 
Hospital. 

Last year over 120 students were 
placed in areas such as the 
Trawna Unit, Emergency Room 
and on nursing floors. The 
response to last years pilot 
program was tenned ' 'tremen-
dous." Some students reported 
that they clarified their career 
goals, others were able to acquire 
lab experience. 

HELP students volunteer a 
minimwn of four hours a week. 
They also attend a weekly 
discussion meeting which features 
·speakers from University Hospital 
or the School of Medicine. Students 
interested in participating in 
HELP this year should attend the 
orientation meeting Thursday, 
Sept. 29, 7 pm at APM 2113. Those 
seeking placements in the 
Psychiatric unit only meet 
Tuesday, Sept. 20, 6 pm at Pickard 
Aud., University Hospital, second 
floor . 

Fun also is the aftermath of the 
performances, the retelling of 
Jokes, the discussion of favorite 
comics and material. Denny 
Johnston, a comedian who will go 
far, did personality sketches, and 
predictably, the five of us each had 
a different favorite . I sbed tears 
over his Jack Nicholson skit 
(placing him as head of a kiddie's 
show), while others went for his 
Jimmy Stewart, Ricky Nelson, 

Marlon Brando and John Wayne 
skits. 

Rather than to further describe 
the show (wait until December's 
special final's week Issue which 
will, hopefully, delve into the many 
facets of humor and certainly go 
more into the workings of The 
Comedy Store ) you should go out 
and experience it yourself. 

Only don't blame me if you die 
laughing.

heavily sprink1ed with arts and 
crafts galleries, centers, and 
festivities , but there are basically 
two major fine-art museums 
topping it all off. The La Jolla 
Museum of Contemporary Art and 
the Fine Arts Gallery in Balboa

the area. . 

The La Jolla Museum ol Con-

UCSD: ShOrt· in Years 
Long in Governments 

bJ' AIId)' 8eIIiIetder 
Asledate News EdIIer 

It's a new year and UC San Dielo 
has another new form of student 
govemme.. Over tbirty~ 
percent of the student body turned 
out in last spring's referendum to 
estabHsh the Associated Students 
as the cerUal student government. 
It is the fifth attempt in seven 
years to develop a representative 
structure on this campus. 

UCSD's political history hu 
been marked by a decade <i 
confrontation between student 
groups which have labeled 
themselves "conservative" or 
" radical." · Often controversies 
were resolved not by students, but 
with the mediation or the in-
tervention of the administration. 

Established in 1971, the first 
Associated Students lasted less 
than two years. Funding 
allocations were bitterly opposed 
by the Young Americans for 
Freedom, ethnic organizations, 
and the campus media. These 
groups could not reach a priority 
consensus, but all roundly con-
demned the operation of the 
fledgling government. 

President Mike Palcic and his 
council members were accused of 
using AS funds to repair personal 
cars, buy brief cases, pay im-
proper salaries, and other abuses. 
The students voted 3 to 1 to 
eliminate the compulsory fee 
which had supported AS programs. 
No elections were held and the AS 
folded. 

urge Turnout 
Over forty one percent of the 

student body voted in that 
referendum. Vice-chancellor 
Murphy used this (less than half 
the student body vote) as leverage 
to re-survey the students on the 
issue of paying fees for student 
activities. On the basis of this 
study, the Chancellor notified the 
students that in their interest be 
would establish an advisory 
committee 01\ student needs called 
the Council of Student Llfe and 
Interests . With representatives 
from each of the colleges, It would 
recommend the allocation of a 
newly established campus activity 
fee . 

By the end of the 1972-73 school 
year, the function of nominating 
students for campus committee 
work was added to this group, 
which now became known as the 
Undergraduate Student CoWlcil. 

Members of this Council 
established a Model Building 
Committee which worked through 
the sommer and proposed a new 
progressive fCll'm of government, 
the Student Cooperative. 

The Coop was designed to build a 
sense of community and a base of 
political advocacy for students. It 
wu part of a national movement 
among university campuses which 
were disbanding hierarchical 
executive structure in favor of 
open participation models. Con-
sensus dl!cisions would be reached 
at town hall style meetings. It had 
volunteer coordinators for action 
centers and support groups instead 
of elected officers. 

Rather than providing services 
or taking the initiative on im-
portant issues, the Coop devoted a 
major portion ot its energy 
towards establishing a workable 
internal structure amI disagreeing 
with an unsupportive ad-
ministration . Equal participation 
could not be translated ' into a 
mutually agreed upon course of 
action to achieve the goals which 
had been set. 

Dissension Among Factions 
Dissension among diverse 

factions of the Coop centered 
around political philosophy and 
method. Inaction coupled to a lack 
of communication with the student 
body led to the demise of the Coop. 
Frustrated with ineffectiveness, 
some Coop members resigned, 
getting out of politics altogether. 
Other Coop members Joined forces 
to establish new fonns of govern-
ment. 

The political complexion of the 
Coop vascillated from week to 
week as oppolling factions gained 
temporary control. Over the 
summer, <l1ancellor McElroy 
commissioned a Task Force to 
examine other alternative fonns of 
governance for the campus. 
During the Winter quarter, 
McElroy called for a referendum 
on the grounds that the Coop had 
failed to return to tbe students a 
vote of support after a trial period 
of operation. 

The Coop is gone, leaving behind 
for the UCSD Associated Student 
Council a legacy of problems which 
include low student participation 
and communication difficulties. A 
new government again has its 
opportunity to meet th.e challenge 
of representation.

DNA Research Spurs Controversy Here, Harvard 
bJ'RaaAUar 

........ 1!:dIter 
Should UC San Diego follow 

Harvard Uidversity's ' example? 
Where "God knows wbat's going to 
crawl out of the laboratory! They 
might even come up with a disease 
that can't be cured, or even a 
monster! " 'Ibis warning W88 
deUvered last year by Alfred 
Velluei, Cambridge's o.upolten 
mayor, regarding a proposed 
Harvard research laboratory . 

Recombinant DNA: Is It really 
an "answer to Frankenstein's 
dream" as Mayor Velluci would 
like us to believe, or Is it a 
relatively safe route which can 
lead to the understanding and 
perhapsocure of cancer, as well as 
genetic diseases such as 
hemophelia, cystic fibrosis and 
diabetes? 

A laboratory similar to Har-
vard's has been planned fflr UCSD. 
The same questions which plagued 
Cambridge, have and will occupy 
the mind of u Jollans in the near 
future. 

Ironically, the recombinant DNA 
teclmique is not as complicated as 
one might expect from "a scien-
tific tool of enormous potential," as 
it has been described by HEW 
Secretary Joeeph Califano. 

DNA (deoxribonucleic acid - the 
genetic material in virtually all 
organisms) is eJ:tracted frun one 
of science's favorite guinea1)igs, 
the Elcberlcbia coU bacterium (E. 
coli for short), by dissolving the 
organism's outer membrane with 
a detergent-like liquid. Most of this 
DNA (in the form of strands) is 
located in chromosomes. The 
remainder, found in small circular 
loops called plasmids, Is then 
separated from the chromosomal 
DNA and placed in a solution 
containing a restriction errzyme. 
The enzyme cuts the plasmids at 
certain points, later to be in-
terlaced and reconnected with the 
genes under investigation. These 
genes can originate from a plant, 
animal, virus or another bac-
terium. 

The newly created, genetically 
altered ge'nes (called chimeras) 
are then readmitted into a host E. 
coU by diffusion, at which point the 
bacterium will treat the DNA as its 
own . This last point is the im-
portant one because when the E. 
coli proceeds to replicate itself it 
makes copies of the chimeras as 
well, thus providing scientists with 
many examples of the gene which 
they wish to study.

" A primary danger," according 

to Nobel uureate George Wald, 
"is that the deliberate production 
of 'desirable' changes in certain 
organisms might result in the 
disruption of the infinitely complex 
and delicate balance among living 
things, a balance which has slowly 
evolved in nature. A sudden 
disturbance of natural relation-
ships could precipitate a disastrous 
and irreversible breakdown of our 
ecosystem."

DNA controversy has brought to 
light many such questions. 

A safer strabt? 
In 1975, Dr. Paul Berg of Stan-

ford University hosted a con-
ference attended by 134 scientists 

in one of the first attempts to deal 
?'ith these issues. After three da18 
of spirited debate the ICientlsta 
llreed upon safety guidelines 
designed to redia cbanees of an 
"E. eel escape,"Imderwb6cb they 
would conduct reeamblnant DNA 
research. 

1be scientists' worries centered 
around experiments which could 
introduce dangerous genes into the 
chimeras such as the "shot-iun" 
approach where the recombinant 
DNA technique is used to UDcover 
the function of particular genes 
through a random introduction of 
genes into the chimeras without 
previously knowing how the genes 
may affect an E. coH. 

Aware of these facts , the 
scientists agreed to press the 
National Institutes of Health to 
adopt the safety guidelines as 
regulations (which NIH later did ). 
They also decided to halt 
dangerous recombinant DN A 
research until a safer strain of E. 
coli was developed whiCh, for all 
practical purposes, could not cause

"An xl776 E. coli could regress to 
a more resistant fonn and cause

the environment if it escaped.

these conditions, if it does indeed 
have great potential. It is only a

The basic premise is simple. 
Start with classical genetics: Half 
of the mother's genes and half ~ 
the father's genes are united to 
form an offspring. Now enters 
sociobiology (and a little 
evolution) to remind you that the 
genes present In the world today

fail they will not survive.

that genes will do anytllq to

No, ~ sociobiology. 'lbrough 
a quirk 'Of nature worker beet 
share three quarters (i their genes 
with their slater bees. Thus it 
proves more advantageous for 
their genes if the worker bees work 
towards furthering their sisters 
than their own fl.fapring which 
would only share one half fI. their 
genes. For this reason it is not 
Sl&'prlsing that worker bees are 
sterile. 

-Why does a baby want to nurse 
when his mother wants to wean 
him and only nune his younger 
brother? Because, explains 
sociobiology, the baby only shares 
half a set (i his genes with his 
brother, while he has a full set of 
his own genes (obviously.) Thus, 
he would rather continue suckling 
until the benefit to his younger 
brother would prove twice as much 
for himself . And It Is the genes 
which want to benefit themselves 
the most! Meanwhile , the mother 
who shares half her genes with 
each child will want to nurse them 
equally . A conflict arises.

males? According to SOCiobiology, ---~-
the offspring contain more fI. their 
mother's genes than their father 's 
- thus the mothers would have 
more to lose if the offspring were to 
die. Also for this reason, females 
are courted by males because the 
prospective mothers risk more 
time and energy than the male 
once they choose to mate. In the 
species where males help raise 
their own offspring, sociobiology 
also explains this as being most 
beneficial to the male's genes: for 

timwn. 
Many scientists are wary of 

sociobiology because they fear that 
it won't make it as a science but 
will still spread in the populace, 
reports 11me magazine (Augustl) . 
Little work has been done to prove 
the new theory's claims, and many 
have grave doubts as to its 
validity. Its strength, says TIme, 
comes from its " astonishing

Unfortunately, it seems to me 
that be is wrong. For if we were to 
rebel against the tendencies 
programmed into us by our genes 
two alternatives would remain. 
Either our distant offspring would 
soon come under the control of a 
seHish "rebellious gene" or we 
would not survive, lacking a self-
serving, surviving replicator. 
Hence, we're left with a paradox.

Ih8 cUIccw.-ed ecddently Ia lao. 
cIarinC an attempt to improve the 
flavor of bootleI wbialrey. 

Laetrile II mainly derived from 
cruabed apricot pita. It contains 
tracea of aprIcGt pita. It contains 
tracea fI. qanide which, when 
released, prove laic to Uvlng 
cella. In _ EmIt Krebs, Jr., son 
of Laetrile's discoverer, 
"purified" the drug and iaolated ill 
active ingredient. BorrowIni from 
a theory once proposed by ScoWah 

' scienti.t John Beard, Kreb. 
suggested that a enzyme prwent In 
cancer cella would callie the 
cyanide to be released. Normal 
cells Contained another enzyme 
wlicb would detoxify cyanide, 
while cancerous cells did ~ the 
theory stated. Thus normal cells 
wou1d Uve and cancer cells would 
die In Laetrile's presence. 

Unfortunately, Krebs was 
completely WfOII8. Not only did 
attempts to duplicate his 
purification technique fall, but the 
difference. he cited between 
cancerous and normal cells are 
apparently non-aistent. At this 
point the search began for a 
reasonable theory to esplaln 
Laetrile's effects. But any effect 
whicb pro-Laetrile forces have 
attributed to their drug (or 
Vitamin 8-17 81 they sometimes 
refer it to) bave been disputed by 
many scientista, viewing pur-
ported LaetrUe "cures" as 
resulting from placebo effects, 
lucky occurances, or as un-
scientifically recorded. So Laetrile 
was left with a small foundaUon ~ 
reported succeu and no accepted 
theory. Wby then, is it still around? 

Last month's issue (i Co_amtr' 
RepoI1a suggests that, "Laetrile is 
promoted 88 pleasant, rIak-free 

Who [})ne It? /'

"Radiation burna," and 

"~rapy poiIona" as a pro 
tMlrDeftlm ...... 

Public dIIaappointment with 
1Ideace' •• uccesa rate with cancer 
baa also con~ to Laetrile's 

popularity. Cancer is contracted 
by 700,000 Americana annually and 
two out of three of these people will 
ultimately die of the disease. 

Current debate around Laetrile 
centers, however, more on the 
Issue of its legalization than on Its 
effectiveness as a cure. Most 
media coverage reports that 
laetrile is indeed ineffective as a 
dJ1Ig to cure cancer. This stance .is 
backed by the National Cancer 
Institwe, the American Cancer 
Society, the American Medical 
Association, and Olost pbySiclana, 
as reported by SciellCe magazine. 

Not Tested? 
Mark McCarty, UC San Diego 

Medical StudeDt, suggested in a 
Triton Times article published in 
late 1975, that things may not be 81 

clearcut as they seem. McCarty 
claimed that laetrile bas never 
beeo tested adequately. Tests 
wlich bave been conducted or 
referred to by anti-Laetrile forces 
were not -a proper measure (i the 
drug's elfectivenesa, he said. 
Furthermore, McCarty charged, 

Laetrile baa been burt by the 
stigma atuched to It as a "quack" 
drug, ever since Krebs' theory had 
been refuted. 

It has been proposed that 
Laetrile may form a lQllV senun 
cyanide level in the body, which is 

non~oldc to the host but to which 
cancer tissue is selectively sen-
sitive. Reviewing criticism against 
this propos8l, McCarty did not find 
them undebatable and advocated 
that further testing be doen on 
Laetrile. U.s. Newa (June 6) 
reported that such testina may 
Indeed by underway soon. "In 
reaponae to heightening pressure, 
the National Cancer Institute is 
considering the first human test fI. 
the treatment ... 

"Health ofticials predict that if 

the Laetrile question were settled 
with a careful human study nearly 
all consumers would make the 
proper choice of treatment." 

Jl'ftedom 
Meanwhile, on another front, a 

battle is shaping up around the 
legalization of laetrile as a 

question of freedom : Should 
Americans be allowed to make , 
their own decisions regarding 
drugs which have not been proven 
effective? 

The New York Times thinks that 
terminal cancer patients should be 
allqwed to take Laetrile. Governor 
Jerry Brown belleves that people 
can ingest whatever they wish as 

long as it ian't proven harmful. 
Steven Symms, Republican of 
Idaho, has introduced a Bill in the 
House of Representatives which 
would repeal the provisions from 
the 1962 amendment to the Food, 
Drug, and Cosmetic Act requtrlng 
proof fI. a drug's effectiveness 
before it can be marketed. 

The " Medical Freedom-of-
Choice" Bill, as it is caDed, has 
been suggested, according to 
Symms because, "the value of a 
new drug is often clear to the ex-
pert in the clinical field before it is 
formally recognized by a reviewer 
at the FDA.. 

"The simple fact is that stringent 
drug regulation for society as a 
whole, limits therapeutic choice by 
the individual physician, who Is 
better able to judge risks and 
benefits for the Individual patient. 
I think the whole argument centers 
on the FDA's intervention on the 
basis of a product's efficiency," he 
said In an interview with US News. 

A recent FDA Drug Bulletin 
expresses the fear foutld on the 
other side. " No worthless drug is 
without harm; a patient's choice of 
Laetrile , to the extent that such 
choice delays or Interferes with 
swift diagnosis and prompt ef-
fective treatment, Is potentially 
fatal. " 

And the Consumer Reports adds, 
". . .the " Medical Freedom-of-
Oloice" Bill has no place among 
the laws of the land. It would tum 
the clock back to a time when 
purveyors of worthless nostrums 
could prey freely on an un-
protected publlc , exploiting the 
fears of the sick and the 
desperation of the dying. " 

And so the debate rages on.

UCSD R~istration 
Process, . ProcedureS 
Outlined Here 

UCSO has developed different col.... in order to retain the 
small coli ... atmosphere of close 
relationships between the 
students and faculty. 

lower division classes are 
taLllht by professors rather than 
srad students as frequently oc-
curs in IIrger universities. 

It takes 180 units for you to 
.... aduate from the University of 
California, San Diego. To earn 
these units, you must take classes. 

Classes at UCSD can be 
grouped into categories acoording 
to their use towards graduation. 
Most lower division classes can be 
used for general education 
requirements of each college. 
Upper division classes count 
towards a major. Lower division 
classes are usually of an in-
troductory nature while upper 
division classes presume some 
basic knowledge of the field 
covered. 

Signing up for classes involves 
some forethought in order to get 
the classes you ~nt. The earlier 
you return ur preferred 
program card on the assigned day, 
the better your chances of getting 
the classes you wantor need. 

Classes may be dropped until 
the 6th week of the quarter (see 
box on dropping/ adding and 
PI NP) . The Registrar's Office will 
process up to 18 units on a 
preferred program card and 
additional units can be obtained 

throu.h petition with the 
Provost's office of your particullr 
college. 

If when you receive your 
schedule you are closed out of one 
or more classes, then go to the 
class the first day and try to get 
the instructor to sign your add/· 
drop card (available in the 
Provost's and Registrar's offices). 

The first day of class more 
people show up than are really 
interested in the class, so by the 
end of the second week (deadline 
to add classes), there is usually 
enough room for those students 
still wishing to add the class. 

To find out what classes are 
being offered and the times and 
places, buy a schedule of Classes 
at the Bookstore or the Revelle 
Store. They are also available in 
the Provost's offices and the 
Cluster I Library. They cost .15c 
and include new course 
descriptions which are not 
available in the General Catalog. 
The schedules also contain the 
final examination schedule for the 
end of the quarter. 

When planning your schedule, 
figure the amount of class work 
you 'll have to do in terms of hours. 
When the CEP approves a four-
unit class, they figure a student 
must spend 12 hours a week, 
including class time, to earn an A 
in that class. Add in to your 
schedule the amount of hours you 
work each week. 

Q-aje Proolan Mght re OEJical Erroc 
If your ~'B" Became an "A" in the Mail 

After each quarter grades are 
mailed to you as part of your 
transcript. Often, there occur gaps 
in what you think you deserved 
from a grade and what the 
transcript says. 

The problem could be in 
recording the grade. Make sure 
the difference between what you 
got and what you think you should 
have gotten is not merely a dif-
ference of opinion concerningyour 
performance in the class. 

If the problem is a simple 
clerical error, see the department 
secretary with proof that it was a 

clerical error. If both the prof and 
the secretary still don't know how 
that strong B turned into a sickly 
C, then it's down to the Registrar's 
Office. 

If after the quarter ends you find 
yourself with a grade in a class 
that you are unsatisfied with and 
there's no possibility of having it 
changed, you can repeat the class 
when it is offered again . When you 
do a class over , the old grade 
appears with the new one on the 
transcript, but the new grade is 
used for tabulating the Grade 
Point Average (GPA). 

AdcV Drop' Cards Used 
for Late Registration 

Add/ Drop Cards are u~ed to enroll in a class or withdraw from a class 
after registration . Add/ d 'op cards are also used to enroll in a class on a 
Passl Not Pass basis . 

Add/ drop cards can b~ pbtained in the beginning of each quarter at 
Edna or at the Registrar' > office, the college provosts ' and deans' offices. 
Fill them out as indicat<!d, then return them to the Registrar's Office 
before Friday of the seco,',d wee~ oft~", r!,/Mter. 

Campus Dog Rules 
1. Any dog on campus must be on a hand held leash not exceeding 

six feet in length. If a dog is not controlled in this manner, it shall be 
classified as "at large". 

2. Any dog on campus must have a valid County or City license 
attached to its collar. 

3. Dogs are not permitted in any classroom or teaching laboratory, 
even though leashed and licensed, with the following exceptions: 

A) . A seeing-eye dog serving an owner. 
B) . University owned doIS undergoing research applications. 

If you feel you need time to 
yourself, you can either withdraw 
from school or take a leave of 
absence. If you have already paid 
your registration fee and decide to 
withdraw, a Request for With-
drawal form must be filed with the 
Registrar. By withdrawing you 
receive a partial refund of your 
fees and get out of your classes 
without an F. When withdrawing, 
you lose your continUing status 
and must reapply to re-enter 
UCSD. 

For a leave of absence, students 
in good standing may eleet to be 
absent from anyone quarter 
without losing their continuing 
student status as long as the 
student does not attend another 
school . Upon returning, the 
student should contact the 
Registrar. If absentfor longer than 
one quarter, it is necessary to 
reapply as an entering student. 

I ncompletes may be assigned in 
undergraduate courses when a 
student's work is of passing 
quality but incomplete for a good 
reason. Request to receive an 
incomplete form must be filed by 
the student and instructor with 
the Registrar. 

Most professors do not like to 
give incompletes after the final 
exam while others will grant them 
even after the final. It's up to the 
professor. Your best chance of 
getting an incomplete is to ap-
proach the professor as soon as 
possible. The student must also 
pay $5 to the Cashier. An in-
complete changes to an F if the . 
work is not completed within a 
quarter.

educational systems around the 
world. This is your chance to know 
the campus and to work with 
administrators and faculty

interest.

campus and the University apply

Coordinators, or drop by your 
Dean's office and ask for in-
formation .

Some TipS on How to 
Hang on to your Bike 

Bicycles are al11Ofl8 favorite 
methods of student trans· 
portation . The ad.vantages are 
obvious - the disadvantages may 
not be. Here are a few preventive 
suggestions to help you hang on to 
your spokes: 

• Register your bicycle with the 
campus police for free . For SI.you 
can register it with the City of San 

Operation I D 
To protect )'Our larger valuables, 

it would be wise to have them 
registered under "Operat ion 
Identification." 

Under this system, your radio, 
stereo, appliances, scuba gear, 
etc., are marked with your driver's 
license number by an .electric 
pencil. This makes )'Our belongings 
harder to re-sell if they are stolen , 
and easier to identify to reclaim. . 

In many cases, these .types of 
belongings cannot be returned to 
you if found during an arrest 
unless there is some kind of 
registered number on them. It is a 
good idea to take advantage of th is 
service. You should also mark 
radio and ta'pe deck'equipment in 
your car. 

The electric pencil isavailableat 
the Campus Police Department, 
Bldg. 500 Matthews Campus. 
Phone 452·Help. 

Diego, which also registers it 
throughout the state. 

• Protect )'Our bike against rust 
and thieves by arranging to leave 
it in a friend's suite in a dorm. Next 
choice is a good lock and a chain. 
Some bike racks are equipped 
with big chains, and will require 
only a padlock .- however these 
are few and it may be safer to 
bring a chain and just leave it 
locked on the rack. 

• Park your bike in a visible 
area so II thief would have to work 
in front of an audience to liberate 
your wheels. Never park a bike 
behind shrubs or bushes. 

• Park your bike in a different 
place each day (and don't forget 
where you left it!) . Most rip-offs 
are bikes left unattended at the 
same time in the same place every 
day. 

• Get bike insurance, the cost is 
about $12 for the first $100 of 
value, and S4 for each 550 ad-
ditional value. Call the UCSD bike 
shop for more information: 452· 
4279. 

The UCSD bike shop is located 
in the Student Center. They are 
open 10-5 weekdays and 10-3 
Saturdays. They organize rides 
.and races, sell and repair bikes at 
discount prices, and offer 
wheelchair repair as well . 

Buy a Parking Permit 
at Cashier's Office; 
Av<*l Unseemly Tickets 

Parking services are located 
at 400 Matthews Campus and 
is open from 7:30 am. to 12:30 
p.m. and 1:00 p.m .t04:30 p.m ., 
Monday through Friday . 
Telephone: 452·4223 . 

"S" or student permits are 
available at the cashier's office, 
401 M.c. Vehicle registration 
must be shewn to obtain a 
permit. Weekly permits are also 
available. You can park without 
a permit between September 
19, 1977 and September 25, 

1977 . After that time, an " S" 
permit will be required in order 
to park in the student lots . 
Failure to do this will cause 
tickets to begin multiplying on 
your windshield; fines will 
increase in size with each 
additional tick'et . 

You don't need a permit to 
park alonll Torrey Pines Road 
or city streets. Courtesy service 
for permit holders whose 
battery has died is given free of 
charge by the campus police.

Over '30 I ntercollegiates to Ch oose From 

I Ms Organ ized Accord ing 
To Degrees of Competition 

The UCSO Intercollegiate 
Athletic program has more than 
thirty teams to choose from. 
Students of varying interests and 
abilities have an open door to 
athletic experiences. Teams range 
from the traditional baseball, 
softball, track and field, cross 
country, soccer and golf to the less 
common rubgy, water polo, field 
hockey, surfing, crew, badminton, 
and fencing. New teams are form-
ed based on demonstrated 
student interest with the only 
limiting factors being the 
availability of funds and facilities. 

The same athletic philosophy 
governs men and women athletics. 
The goal of the program is to 
provide enjoyable athletic ex· 
periences that contribute to the 
health, welfare and general 
education of all interested 
students. Athletes of both sexes 
travel throughout Southern 
California and share successfully 
in the use of facilities, equipment, 
and financial resources. No 
athletic scholarships exist, but the 
values derived from participation 
with other athletes, receiving 
instruction from qualified coaches 
and striving for eKcellence are 
numerous. The 1100 students 
involved in Intercollegicfte 
Athletics can attest to the joy of 
such competition. 

All interested students, 
regardless of skill level , are en-
couraged to attend team meetings 
which take place during the first 2 
weeks of Fall Quarter. Some teams 
require higher skill levels than 
others, but other teams (those not 
normally encountered in High 

SchOQI) provide instruction in 
basiC fundamentals. Even if you 
don't make the team, there is 
always a need for volunteer 
assistants, statisticians, sports 
information workers. etc. If you 
have any questions, drop by the 
Intercollegiate Athletics Office in 
the Main Gym or phone 452-4211 . 

Recreation Clubs are another 
part of physical education at 

Bargain Hunters Attention 

UCSD. There are 23 Rec. Clubs 
ranging from Belly Dancing ~o 
Soaring . 

An information sheet listing club 
activities is printed weekly , and a 
newsletter provided on a quar-
terly basis with a brief description 
of each club and contact persons. 
For more information regarding 
clubs or their activities call 452 -

Intramurals are ongoing sports 
programs whereby students can 
form teams and compete 'against 
other students in organ ized 
leagues. Over 60 percent of the 
students participate in some form 
of the intramural sports. The 
nature of the particular sport 
coincides with the appropriate 
season. Some of the sports are: 
football, soccer, inner tube water 
polo, basketball , volleyball and 
softball. All of these sports are 
coeducational and thus stimulate 
the opportunity for meeting 
students of both sexes, providing 
an opportunity to get socially' 
involved without the competition 
associated with hard·core sports. 

which they wish to play . Levels-of 
easy competition are made up of 
students who aren't as interested 
in winning the game as they are in 
having a good time. As the levels 
increase to higher competition , 
you will find people who are more 
concerned about winning, yet can 
still have a good time. There is no 
excuse for ability problems, 
everyone can find a level of 
competition to play in. 

Tips on' HoW to Do Things Cheaply 

There is no problem in ability 
because teams are organized 
according to ten degrees of 
competition . Men and women can 
choose the level of competition at 

Being on an intramural team will 
probably take a few hours on a 
Saturaay or Sunday afternoon, 
and may be a few hours of practice 
during the week (if you need it) . 
The advantages of meeting people 
should override the time element 
in participating in intramurals. For · 
more information and sign·ups for 
teams, go to the intramural office 
located in the ree.gym building. 

'Students Covered Under 
Health I nsutance Plan 

In add.ition to access to care at the Student Health Center, all 
students registering at UCSD this fall and paying full registration 
fees are automatically covered under a limited supplemental in-
surance plan for medically necessary health care that cannot be 
provided at the Student Health Center. Coverage is provided for 
accidental injury care, special laboratory tests and x-rays, con-
sultations with medical specialists when referred by the Student 
Health Service, and surgery. 

If you need to be hospitalized, the insurance program will pay up to 
S 1 ,500 in hospilal benefits. While S 1,500 may seem like a lot, it is not 
a great deal at today's soaring hospital costs. The campus has 
therefore made an additional optional insurance plan available to 
registered studen ts . This doubles the hospital benefits you may 
receive up to $3 .000 and also provides a major medical expense plan 
that pays 80 percent of additional covered expenses up to $2,000 
after you have paid the first $100 of bills and 100 percent of all ad-
ditional covered expenses up to $25.000 . The premium for this ad· 
ditional protection is very low at $5 per quarter. 

For getting out of town , buses 
are always the cheapest , Local 
Greyhound stops right by campus 
(Revelle lights, flag 'em down) . 
Next is the train , then t~e airplane. 
The nearest Amtrak station to 
campus is on Coast Blvd. in 
Del Mar. San Diego International 
Airport is an hour away on the 
local bus, 15 minutes by car. All 
methods have downtown offices. 

For cheaper phone calls make 
use of special .lol}g-distance phone 
rates-cheaper after SiK on week· 
days, before six on Sundays. 

Frats t Sororities 
Springing Up 

Until recently , UCSD was a 
University without the traditional 
Fraternities and Sororities 
registered on campus. Presently 
there are four organizations: 
Epsilon AlPha Beta , Alpha Phi 
Alpha, and'T'hi Omega Alpha Delta , 
Delta Gamma sorority . Others are 
currently in the formative stage. 

Religious Groups 
Unite Members 

Organizations of a religious 
nature include' the Campus 
Crusade for Christ, the Trident 
Christi.n Fellowship, and the 
Union of Jewish Students. Each of 

To get this additional insurance you must apply for it during the 
open insurance enrollment period at the beginning of each quarter. 
Application forms and more complete explanations of benefits are 
available at the Student Health Center on the Matthews campus for a 
limited time beginning September 19. If you are already well covwed 
under an insurance policy from home, you problbly won't need this 
extra protection. And if you .re eligible for Univenity of California 
financial assistance, you miaht qu.11fy to have thiI additional In· 
surance provided for ~ as pert of your flnanci.lalel packaae. (Check

A short trip to Tijuana often 
pays off in acquiring cheaper food, 
clothing and furniture. Alconol , 
too, is cheaper across the border, 
but it is illegal for US. residents to 
bring any amount of alcohol across 
the border. Getting caught results 
in losing your booze and sub-
jection to stiff fines. ' 

Restaurants and theaters are 
always running specials which are 
advertised in local papers. 

Two useful tools in looking for 
bargains are newspaper ads, both 

display and classified, and the 
yellow pages of the telephone 
book . 

For items other than food , large 
chain stores are always going to 
have the least expensive mer· 
chandise. For items such as 
clothes , furniture and hardware, 
check the several thr ift and 
second -hand stores both in 
downtown San Diego and 
Oceanside. Such places includ~ 
Goodwill , Salvation Army and 
Amvets .

The fashions were bizarre and

Nobody wanted to Bee Capwell's

and winter "creates energy.filled 
feelinga with all the warmth rl the

And since .hort hair "left 
necklines open to the titter cold" 
Solar Hair is longer than current 
styles. 

"I hope they don't Solarize' my 
hair," I said. 

"See that cut you are wearing," 
said a convention person to me at 
the luncbeon. "1bat was conceived 
here five years ago." 

So maybe we won't see Solar

ended the war In favor of the

The Mormon Battalion Census of 

I11t7 tells us that there were "248 
white persons, 413 tame Indiana, 
1550 wild Indians, three Negroes, 
and three Sandwich Isl3nders" 
living in San Diego. Cultural ac-
tivities of the time included cock-
figlU, horse races, and frequent 
bull and bear fights. Sunday's were 
festive occasiona, with parties 
always following church. 

Thea It happened. In 1850 
California became a state. San 
Diego was the first COWity to be 
created in California. The same 
year it was incorponited sa a 
regular town. Joshua Bean became 
the mayor, polling 87 votes in San 
Diego and 68 in La Playa. Eat your 
hear! out, Pete WUson. 

In 18$0 there were three prac-
tidng attorneys in San otego and a 
new hotel. On May 29, 11151, the San 
Diego Herald became the ,first 
published newspaper here . In 1852 
the Masons established themselves 
here. 'that meant civilization. 
Matters progesaed quickly. In 1887 
Alonzo E . Horton brought what 
was then referred to as New Town, 
Horton's Addition, 01' South San

is presently called Downtown San 
Diego. 

The· original San Diego (Old 
Town) was hit by a diaastl'OU8 fire 
In April, 1872. Migration to what is 
presently referred to as San Diego 
was thus expedited. 

The completion of the Santa Fe 
Railroad, development rl water 
systems, the good word about San 
Diego's climate, and land 
speculation, led to San Diego's 
rapid growth in the late 1800II. 

The rest is history.

"The Silldcst Place in calor ria. Exceptitg SiwI Pedro" 

A Fair to Middlin' HiStory of San Diego County 
by AIaa a-eo 

Ed ... 
San Otego-America's fIneIt dty. 

Was it less than 150 yean ago when 
French traveller and writer 
Duhart.QUy called San Diego the 
saddest place in CalIfornia, ex-
cepting San Pedro? 

It was. 
Believe it or not, San Diego has 

not always been the renowned 
mecca of IUD and 1UI'f. In fact, the 
breltHeId.., beamy of San Diego 
was often cwerlooUd Of' forptten 
in the midst of other landIcapee. 

Observe the words of a newly 
arrived 1885 scboolteacher. "Of aU 
the dUlapldated, miserable looking 
places I had ever seen, this was the 
worst. 1be buildings were nearly 
aU adobe, one story In hei~, with 
no chimneys. " 

So how did San Diego beccme 
America's finest city? Ab, listen 
my readers and you shaD heal' ... 

Juan Rodriguez CabriUo was the 
first white ulan to sight San 
Diego's shores. In September, 1542, 
he saUecI his two amaU Spanisb 
Navy shipe into San Otego Bay, one 

of the finest natural harbors in the 
world. The explorer left his vessel 
to claim the land for the flag of 
Castille and Aragon, and after 
staying for some days on the coast 
with his men, they returned to the 
ship and traveDed northwards to 
explore more. 

Tbe Namtag of SaD Diego 
It -was 60 years before another 

major expedition arrived In San 
Diego. Don Sebastian Viscaero 
entered the harbor In 1802, and he 
is the gentleman credited with 
giving the city its present ap-
pelation. The name of San Diego Is 
believed to have been given in 
honor of San Diego de Alcala (St. 
James of Alcala), 01' perhaps for a 
certain st. Didacus of the Latin 
calender. 

The third large excursion Into 
San Diego didn't occur until 1769. 
Three expeditions arrived In May, 
June and July, with the last one 
being the most Important, as it 
brought our first settlers. The 
weary, limping Franciscan priest 
Junipel'O Serra and 64 other men 
arrived on July 14. 

M in medieval times, it was 
necessary to build upon a high 
point 10 that the position might 
easily he defended. Serra chose 

driven back, but one servant boy of 
the p adres was killed . 

Few written records mention 
anything of Importance happening 
in the next six years . Those things 
written about the Indians could not 
be called complimentary. The 
Diegueno 's only comment was a 
November, 1775 uprising j their 
first 'and essentially last attack 
against the mission. The cause of 
the sudden fight was not known, 
and the only tangible result was the 
death of several men. 

The years passed rather quietly, 
though American-Spanish 
hostilities were noted as early as 
1803 In San Diego. Mexican in-
dependence occurred from Spain 
in 1821, and San Diego 
automatically became a Mexican 
colony. At the time Mexico really 
didn't seem to care much about a 

flea overrun " city" which con-
sisted of those buildings housed 
behind the al'obe walls of the 
garrison on Pre~ ;dio Hill. 

Not much happened in San Diego 
until Americans decided Californ ia 
should be theirs . Even then it 
seemed that not much happened. 
San Diego was captured by United 
States proclamation, and there 
was no bloodshed . The California 
Battalion of Volunteers arrived in 
San Diego on the Sloop Cyane on 
July 29, 1846. Captain Samuel F . 
Dupont, with 160 marines and 
scouts, including such notables as 
John C. Fremont and Kit Carson, 
claimed San Diego for California. 
Carson himself raised the first 
American flag in California by

Stadler recalled. "At first I didn't have a

that during the games. And I had to adjust to 
living on my own, buying my own food and

Another night , this time in August, Stadler 
received his first starting assignment. The 
manager, Ernie Rodriguez, obviously didn't 
expect much; he told Stadler to "hold them 
for two or three innings." 

"I went six-and~ne-third innings, had six 
strikeouts, and won, 7-3 ." Stadler said with a 
smile. "I showed Ernie I could do the job." 

That night , Stadler and his roomies talked 
about the game, no doubt in great detall . 
And the rest of the season went well for the 
YOWlg right hander. He pitched in several 
more games, and received one more start, 
which he lost in a heartbreaking way. He 
ended up with commendations from the 
pitching coach and manager, the lowest

There have always been rumors 
about the sheer brutality of Pro

just how a football player would 
behave. I had visions of seeing

Then came the word that, thiI

have to be revamped. And they 
even chipped in sene money.

by something else. Who cared

wben I could watch sixty players 
sputter around on ten~peed bikes? 
Being locked on campus most of 
the time the only ouUet they had 
while not working was to stroll 
through the campus and see the 
sights. They wouid even ride to the 
cafeteria. 

And then due to an opening (and 
boredom on my part ) I was hired. 
Being hired only to work dinners I 
missed the alleged consumption of

and half a dozen coaches, perhaps 
sixty five steaks and forty slabs of 
liver would be prepared with small

were virtually unheard of unless

With the exception of James 
Harris, since I'm an LA boy, I 
couldn't recognize any of the 
players because of the lack of

wore Adid&cl shirts . . 

Approximately one half hour 
after lining up for the meal they 

would exit discarding their trays. 
Many would casually walk back to 
the two men rooms, their two

An air fI. excitement on most 

college campuseII is evidem tbia 
time of year_ Sure. it'l the 
beglnnini fI. • new aool y.r and 
a few book~onacloua students 
eagerly await massive loads (( 
studying. 

But it's more important than 
clasaes. It provides an excuse for 
75,000 people to gather in a stadilan 
on Saturday afternoon, yell until 
their voices give out and drink beer 
until they keel over. 

Obviously, college football is the 
topic here. The fates of universities 
nationwide hinge on the success of 
their football team. A winner 
ensures good press coverage, 
accolades and generous donations 
from alumni. A loser means 
maligning of tile school and all that 
it stands for by newspapers and 
fans. Coachs' and players' 
pregame remarks seem more 
Important than those of Jinuny 
Carter on foreign poUey. 

On most campuses. upcoming 
games are the focal point fI. con-
versations durin8 the fall. "Will we 
win? How do our cheerleaders 
stack (sic) up to tboee of our opo 
ponerU? Will we go to a bowl 
game?" Pep raDies, bon firea, 
speeches the night before the 
game. Victory parties or hanging 
the coach in effigy after the game. 

All this hooplah continues 
through into basketball season and 
carries over to track, baseball and 
swiInmin8. And aD this hooplah is. 
conspicuously absent at UC San 
Diego. 

NeFootball 
UCSD has no football team. 

Years ago, we fielded a squad but 
student disinterest in the·form of 
small crowds at the now 
dilapidated MaUhews Fieid, lack 
of quality players, numerous in-
juries and IDOIt lmportanUy - a 
lack of funds caused the demJse of 
college football in La Jolla. 

Saturday afternoons find 
students here watchIng grid-iron 
games on TV. rooting for their 
hometown teams (usually UCLA or 
Cal)-or stu.dying in one of the four 
libraries on campus_ 

The University of California at 
San Diego does, however, have 24 
intercollegiate teams . These)2 
men's and 12 women's squads often 
compete before tiny crowds, even 
though no admission is charged at 
any event. Only once in the last 
three yean ~ the- main gym-
nasium been filled to its 2500 

c~pacity for a basketball game 
(vs . archrival USIU in 1975 for an 
NAIA playoff spot). Attendance at 
baseball games is comprised of 
player's parents and an occasional 
pro scout. 

For 1m-78, the 24 teams are 
earmarked for a budget of $45,700: 
Nine teams with club status 
receive $1800, bringing UC San

tercollegiate funding for this 
academic school year to $47,500. 

$47,500? USC spends that much 
alone on tape for their football 
player's legs. UCLA's prestigious 
basketball program budget is at 
least ten times that amount. USC, 
UCLA, Notre Dame, Michigan and 
tens of other colleges pour miHions 
of dollars annually into in-
tercollegiate athletics in hopes of 
winning the sacred NCAA title . 

Money Not the Reason 
Why such a small amount for 

sports at UCSD? Reasons are 
numerous and varied _ First, the 
campus has only been in existence 
eleven years (maybe the ad-
ministration Is slowly saving up to 
buy quality teams). Secondly, UC 
San Diego also offers no athletic 
scholarships, thus cutting out a big 
chunk of a possibly larger budget. 
A third reason is the faculty and 
students have shown no desire for a 
big-time sports program. Finally, 
it's written on the wall that we 
emphasize learning ~re , not 
athletics .

in the interim. 

He is not a candidate for the 
permanent job, a condition that he 
made before taking over in May. 

"The phYSical problems en-
countered by students tend to 
parallel that of the problems in the 
general population, but they 
become more obvious in the en-
closed setting. 

"The main problem is the 
development of a coronary risk 
factor. For instance, one in five 
males will have a heart attack by 
the age of 55. " 

Hunt emphasized that the 
physical deterioration occurs 
equally in males and females, 
though perhaps it is often more 
noticeable in females "because of 
the sexist ways many people view 
beauty." 

Advice is available at the 
physical education office for in· 
dividuals, and classes are offered 
in ~ach quarter in weight training, 
weight ~o~ditioning, exercising, 
and nutritIOn. Further advice is 
also available at the student health 
center. 

"U students care at all about 
being healthy 25 years from now, 
they must begin working for it 
inunediately. It might be a little 
hard to realize, but unless they 
combat the new pressures they will 
find here, physical deterioration is 
very likely."

"I'm a pacifist aoId1w for the 
callie," declared a determined 
nuclear power ~, who 
planned to occupy Diablo Olnyon 
Nuclear Power Plant later thAt 
day. Tbe Alii. 7 demonstration at 
San Luis Obispo, featurinl 
speakers DanIel Ellsberg .and 
Barr)' Commoner, drew a crowd 01 
1000 persona from all regions of 
california. . 

Commemorating the 32nd an-
niversary 01 the bomlmg of 
HiroI!Ibima In IIH&, participants of 
the Abalone AllIance sponsored 
event gathered on a resort area 
beach under a blazing sun to 
protest the building and operation 
of nuclear power plants. 
Musicians, singing original "no-
nuke" songs, and speakers, kept 
the crowd's attention during the 
afternoon, wIKle 50 persons readied 
themselves In non violence 
training before entering and 0c-
cupying the plant alte later that 
day. Forty eight of the protestors 
were aublequentiy arrested. 

Organizers pointed to the 
earthquake threat, poaed by tbe 
Hosgri earthquake fault located 
about three miles off the coast, as 
the major hazard In the operation 
of the plant. The US Geological 
Survey Selamologiat determined 
that the maximum ground ae-
celeratioo of the fault exceeds that 
which tbe structure is able to 
withstand. Structural welding 
mistakes, low level radiation 
emiaalons and inefficient waste 
disposal methods were also cited 
as operating dangers. 

"I'm here beca\lle I think It may 
save III," said Ellaberg, ad-
dressing the audience solemnly. 
"Mobilization for survival" was 
the . theme of bla message, and 
Ellsberg blasted the Carter ad-
ministration for allowing tbe US 
nuclear arsenal and 8-52 bomber 
supplies to multiply, which he 
preclcts could reach 1,000,000

tinued by speculating on the civil 
liberties threat which could arise 
through the use of breeder reac-
ton. He envlaloned torture, lie 
detectors and detemioo by the 
govermnent of aaapects In a time of 
theft of radioactive materials. 

Problema Aceompuy 
NaclearAuw 

"You don' need radioactivity to 
boD water," stated Commoner. 
"Nuclear power la much more 
powerful than it needs to be." He 
analogized the situation as 
"ringing the doorbell with a 
cannon, the stupidest way of 
ringing a doorbell that I 
know . "The problems ac-
companying nuclear reactors are 
inflatioo, unemployment, a super 
concentration of COI]XlI'ate control, 
military control of energy and a 
basla for fascism, he stated. 

It was announced that during the 
activities a solar oven had been 
baking bread at 350 degrees during 
the speeches and It would be 
available for sampling. Alice 
Logan, occupier representative, 
read the code of discipline 
established for those persons who 
would cross illegally onto Pacific 
Gas and Electric private property 
to establish their opposition to the 
operation of the plant. "The oc-
cupiers will respond to opposition 
and hostility with love and com-
passion," she said. They would 

Fred Cook, UCSD Third College 
graduate, helped to organize the 
activities and felt that the issue of 
dangerous nuclear power should be 
considered seriausly by San 
Diegans. "San Diego is well within 
the range that could be devastated 
by an accident at the San Onofre 
plant. and low level radiation, 
which Is routinely emitted, can 
drift at least as far as San Diego." 
Cook said that San Diego ~idents 
know how dlsasterous it can be to 
depend economically on ooe in-
dustry, the military, and that It 
should serve as an eumple for the 
nation, which relies heavily on 
electricity. "We need to diversify 
away from a dependence on 
electricity and from dependence on 
centralized sources of power," said 
Cook, adding that jobs would be 
created through the building of 
solar collectors and in installing 
insulation to conserve heat. 

Dlvene MDture of DIssidents 
The occupiers were out-

numbered by reporters as they 
scaled the fence toward the power 
plant access road. Pollce 
helicopters hovered overhead, and 
tbe group was confronted and 
arrested by authorities at tbe bead 
of the road. It may have surprised 
tbe police that the persons they 
arrested were not the stereotypical 
sixties radicals, but a diverse 
mixture of concerned citizens. 

Local farmer, Ian McMillan, 
declared himself "an older citizen, 
with children and grandchildren. 
Our right to a healthful, resour-
ceful envirorunent has not been 
considered." He said he had given 
a lot of thought to the power plant 
issue before resolving his dilenuna 
and deciding to support the protest 
through occupation . "I can justify 
trespass ," said McMillan , 
"because the government has 
failed to comply with the law in 
seeing to my constitutional 
rights." He saw it ' as an act of 
responsibility and that the 
violation of a minor law was ap-
propriate .

tairunem zone of the plant but says 
she ~sn't fear so much for 
herself as she does for the 30,000 
others who live in the area. " I think 
It's time we should make our ob-
jections known," Black stated 
resolutely. "We can't do it without 
action." 

A college aged man, known as 
Duke, wanted to "attract a lot of 
attention" through occupation. His 
primary reason for objecting to 
plant operations was concern 
about the danger of radiation 
poisoning breaking open in an 
earthquake. . 

NOll-Violence Tactics 
Duke spoke of a meeting the 

preceding weekend at which the 
occupiers discussed non-violence 
tactics, partiCipated in role 
playing, talked about the legal 
questions and consequences and 
formed affinity groups. The six 
groups of five to ten people were 
established as a supportive fun-
ction for their members. 

The gathering did not pass 
without opposition. The Stanford 
Chapter of Scientists for 
Enllghtment on Nuclear Energy 
Source (SENSE) stood above the 
stage, overlooking the crowd, 
carrying "pro-nuke" signs. 
Professor of mechanical 
engineering at Stanford Tom 
Connolly, said, "I don't think the 
mob ~ competent of determining 
wbether or not there's a fault out 
there." When asked about his 
fmancial stake in nuclear power, 
Connolly reflected and answered 

-Ellsllerg with reporters . (TT 
photo.: Laura A. Richter) 

" I'd be very unhappy if Stanford 
fired me if nuclear plants were 
shut down." 

Another Stanford profesor, John 
Mccarthy, of computer science, 
felt that students are wrong in 
challenging the opening of the 
power plants. "I don 't believe in 
civil disobedience, " said 

Barry Commoner. 

Mccarthy . He saw a major ad-
vantage of nuclear power in -the 
lessening of coal mining, and he 
cited the saving of 30 lives as a 
result. . 

As local plainclothes policemen 
had earlier predicted of the event, 
not a single incident of violence 
was experienced. The peaceful 
aims of the organizers were 
reiterated during the day, and the 
crowd responded favorably to the 
philosophy . Blue dove, yellow sun 
and white annbands indicated 
monitors throughout the crowd, 
who were on duty to insure a 
smooth and successful day. 

US: Land 
Of The 

Beautiful? 
(ZNS) - The year 1976 has 

officially been rated as a poor one 
for the U.S. environment. 

The National Wildlife 
Federation has released its 
annual assessment of the quality 
of the American environment last 
year, and the over-all index 
dropped three points from the 
previous year's rating . 

Pacific News Service, in 
reporting the story, says that 
1976's index rating was a mere 
347 on a scale of 700, down from 
350 one year earlier, and sharply 
down from the all-time high of 406 
in 1969. 

The federation measured 
environmental efforts in seven 
areas and found gains only in air 
quality and forest preservation. 
It added that the national park 
system had deteriorated to what 
it called (quote ) "the worst point 
in history ." 

While there were gams in air 
pollution control. the study said 
that water pollution control, soil 
and mineral conservation, open 
space and wildlife preservation 
were less successful last yea r 
than in the past. , _______________________ 1

"The main problem Is the

Hunt emphasized that the 
physical deterioration occurs 
equally In males and females, 
though perhaps it Is often more 
noticeable In females "because of 
the semt ways many people view 
beauty."

"If students care at aU about

they must begin working for it 
inunediately. It might be a little

A PlaDetarium 
The Fleet Space Theatre 

building features a planetarium-
style theatre in which films are 
shown on a huge, dom~ped 
screen that includes the ceiling. 
The subject matter for the films is 
usually· oriented toward nature or 
space. It's best to get to the 
Theatre early, both to avoid 
possible crowds and to see the 
Science Center, which focuses on 
various scientific advances. 

One drawback of the park stems 
directly from its popularity - it is 
often very crowded. If you do get 
tired of the crowds, just seek out 
one of the many quiet, shaded 
comers, sit back and watch the 
people. It is surprisingly easy to 
make yourself separate from the 
crowds at the park. Another good 
spot to beat the crowds is in the 
Botanical Garden, a large skeletal 
building filled with many species of 
planUife. 

While you're watching the people 
pass by, you might want something 
to eat. Here's a tip : pack a picnic 
IWlch. The park does have a snack 

-bar and a restaurant, the Cafe del 
Hey Moro. But the snack bar food 
is poor, and it costs too much. And 
the Cafe, which is expensive, has

(ZNS)-"Giving the finger~" or 
raising the middle finger in a 
gesture of contempt has been ruled 
offensive, but "not obscene" by a 
three judge state panel In Hart· 
ford, Connecticut. 

The decision was handed down In 
the case of a I6-year old high school 
student who had been fined $25 for 
flashing the gesture at a state 
trooper while the policeman was 
folio win« his school bus. 

Judge Parskey, in a historical 
digression, went on to say that the' 

one~igit gesture dated back at 
least to ancient Greece, when the 
philosopher Diogenes Insulted the 
orator Demosthenes by raising the 
middle finger during one of 
OemOlthenes' speeches.

If aU these factors are true 
(and they are), why do Triton 
teams continue to win - not 
i18tional championships - but 
often league titles and most 
importantly - the respect of 
their opponents, who have all 
their players on athletic 
scholarships while the team 
they just 10lt to has none? 
Despite the small budget, 
UCSD's teams have raised 
more than a few eyebrows of the 
local media and colleges, 

In 1970, Oiuck Millenbah's 
men's vollyball team won the 
NAIA championship. Last 
season, his squad was narrowly 
beaten in five games by two-

time defending NCAA titllst 
UCLA. 

Last spring saw Tad 
Yamaguchi's men's tennis 
team hand highly ranked 
Arizoll8 state their only loss and 
quatlfy for berths in both the 
NCAA and NAJA tournaments 
(which they couldn't compete in 
due to lack of funds) . 

Baseball's Lyle Olsen and 
waterpolo and swimming's 
Gary Becker, now both retired, 
coached their teams to above 
.500 seasons annually. 

With the exceptioo of last 
year, UCSD's men's basketball 
team has maintained a .500 
mark for the last six seasons. In 
1975, two players were first

Mike Shand's surfing team 
won the West Coast Cham-

pionship last JWle and will 
hopefully win the NCAA title in 
1978 (when surfmg becomes an 
NCAA sanctioned sport). 

What does it all mean? A four 
year university de-emphasizes 
athletics and worries only if the 
American Association for the 
Advancement of Science will 
grant the Salk Institute or 
Scripps another million dollars 
for research. But, can Jonas 
Salk execute a fast break? Can 
Herb York pitch a complete 
game? 

UCSD quietly continues to 
compile respectable records in 
intercollegiate athletics despite 
an administrative and student 
lack of concern and a budget 
which barely covers travelling 
expenses. Sometimes bargains 
go unnoticed .

Author Dashes Myth of Christopher Columbus 
.,-.....,.. 

helle Newt Semee 

BERKELEY - '!be myth 01 <luiatopber Columbua' 
dlBcovery 01 America baa been frequently and convincingly 
punctured - and yet it survives. But now, as Americana 
prepare once again to celebrate Columblll Day, a new study 
of CoIUD}bua has appeared that aeida insult to inJury. 

Colwilbus, It seems, not only WBIII't the first European to 
sight the New World - . when he arrived he Introduced to these 
shores all manner 01 mayhem, murder and greed. 

In OIlumbUl: .... Eaterprile (Monthly Review Press, 
1976), Hans Koningsberger, a novelist turned historian, sets 
out to take "a cold and hard look at what Columbus was all 
about." 

In the process - involving examination of historical studies 
and the writings of Columbus and his contemporaries - not 
even the most treasured schoolroom tradition survives: 
Columbus, says Konlngsberger, was far from alone in 
believing that the earth was round. Most educated people of 
his time were convinced 01 the earth's roundness. 

Columbus - a seU-ilducated merchant seaman - differed 
only in believing that the earth was much smaller than it is. 
His mistaken belief that Asia, rich with spices and exotica, 
lay just over the western horizon prompted his promotional 
campaign before the royal courts of Europe . 

Spanish monarchs Ferdinand and Isabella, who finally 
granted Columbus funds for his expedition, knew little about 
sea exploration and considered the effort a shot in the dark -
worth the risk only because it was not very expensive - says 
Koningsberger . They even agreed to Columbus's tenns : 10 
percent of all trade with Asia, admiralty over the western 
ocean and governorship of any newly found lands. 

Landing in the New World, Columbus wrote in his log, 
"Here Is a people to be converted to our Holy Faith by love 
and friendship and not by force . . . " But in the same log he 

..

added, "8bouId your MaJeatiea command it, an the 
inbabitantl could be taken away to CUtile, or made slaves on 
the Island. With 50 men we could subjugate them all and 
make them do whatever we want." 

In fact, the natives 01 Haiti - which ColumbWl thought tid 
Asia - would neVer be converted to Christianity, but would be 
subjugated and then exterminated by Columbus as he trled to 
squeeze the riches 01 the Orient out of the impoverished 
Arawak Indians. 

Reporting to Ferdinand and Isabella 01\ his first voyage, 
Columbus wrote, "Hispaniola iI' a miracle . Mountains and 
hills, plains and pastures, are both fertile and beautiful ... 
the harbors are unbelievably good and there are many wide 
rivers of which the majority contain gold .. . there are many 
spices, and great mines of gold and other metals .. . " As 
Koningsberger commentsi "All of this was fantasy." Later an agent of Co umbus promised Ferdinand and 
Isabella , "On the next voyage the ships will carry away such 
quantities of gold that anyone who hears of it will be dumb-
founded." 

Trying to make good on his promise of unimaginable 
riches, Columbus quickly restored to a system of brutal 
exploitation against the native Arawak Indians. According to 
BIshop de las casas, a member of the expedition, the Indians 
were treated "not as beasts, for beasts were treated properly 
at times, but like the excrement in a public square." 

Every Indian man, woman and child over 14 was required 
to collect gold for the Spaniards. Those who failed to bring in 
their quota had their hands chopped off. According to 
Koningsberger, "There are old Spanish prints that show this 
being done : the Indians stumble away, staring with surprise 
at their ann stumps pulsing out blood." Indians who fled to 
the mountains were systematically hunted down with dogs 
and killed. . 

When there was no more gold, Columbus invented the New 
World slave trade. After rounding up 1,500 Arawaks, he found 

his ship had rOOOl for only 500. He chose the " best 
specimens" to send to Spain. 

According to an eyewitness account, the Arawaks whe-
were released, terror-etricken , " rushed in all directions Ulte 
lunatics, women dropping and abandoning infants in the 
rush, running miles without stopping, fleeing across the 
mountains and rivers." The slave trade turned out to be 
unprofitable , for most of the slaves died. 

Unable to stand the horrors of the new society, the 
Arawaks started to kill themselves in incidents of mass 
suicide, using casava poison. After two years of Columbus' 
administration, an estimated one-hall of the entire 
population of Hispaniola had been killed or had killed 
themselves. According to Koningsberger, "twenty-five years 
later the entire nation had vanished from the earth. Not one 
Indian on the island had ever been converted to what 
Columbus called 'our Holy Faith.' " 

When the Arawaks were gone , the Spaniards divided the 
island into huge estates and imported an estimated two 
million black slaves to work them. A century later, only 
600,000 decendants survived. 

Eventually subjected to a royal investigation for cruelty 
and inefficiency, Columbus was found guilty of 
mismanagement and was brought pack to Spain in chains 
and in disgrace. 

However, he never gave up the idea that he had found a 
western route to the Orient that would enrich Spain beyond 
the wildest dreams of the most ambitious monarchs. In his 
defense to Queen Isabella he wrote, "The gate is open for 
gold and pearls . . .and we can expect large quantities of 
precious stones , spices, and other things." 

Is it worth spoiling Columbus Day by telling the truth about 
Christopher Columbus? 

Koningsberger obviously thinks it is. "Shouldn't we wind 
up that E nterprise of Columbus," he asks, "and start 
thinking of a truly New World?"

Check into Bank of·America. 
Our CoUege Plan 
is made for students. 
Let's begin at the beginning. 

The first thing every student needs is a no-nonsense checking 
account. And in that category, our College Plan Checking Account 
is pretty tough to beat. 

For just $1 a month for the nine-month school year, you get 
unlimited checkwriting, with no minimum balance required . Theres 
no service charge at all for June, July, August, or for any month you 
maintain at least a $300 minimum balance. You get our 
Timesaveril!> Statement every month. And your account stays open 
through the summer, even with a zero balance, saving you the 
trouble of having to close it at the end of the school year, and re-
open it in the fall. Complimentary personalized regular checks are 
available. or premium checks may be purchased. 

BANK OF AMERICA NT&SA. MEMBER FDIC 

To shed a little more light on, the subject, all our branches 
also offer an arra~ of free Consumer Information Reports. Includ-
ing "A Guide to Checks and Checking:'which explains what you 
need to know about cashing and depositing checks, holds and stop-
payment procedures. 

Now, that's not all the bank you'll ever need. And it's certainly 
not all the bank we offer. But it does make for a good start. 

We also offer a wide variety of other banking services you 
might find useful, both in school and after. So why not ch eck in with 
us. You may never have to check anywhere else. 
Depend on us. More California coHege students do.

Douglas. "In researching the book

"Some dogs do not differentiate 
between inside and outside."

2) . No dogs in classrooms or 
teaching laboratories. 
Seeing-eye dogs are ex-

hesda' .............. un 

veils," said Douglu. "Complete 
nudity helps to overcome acme 
barriers." Douglas is quick to add, 
though, "the general public is not 
ready to be immersed in nude 
bathing." 

Research for TIle Nude Beaeh 
was done in a number of locations, 
with Douglas getting reports even 
from "nude reservoirs in Indiana." 
DougIaa said that, ''There are all 
kinds of nude beaches in CalIfor-
nia." Many are what be terms 
"wildcat" beaches - thoae that 
spring uP all over, and are found in 
IiWe deserted coves and the like. 
"a.eck-outs" were done on the 
beach to detennine how they were 
different from other nude beaches. 
IDdIvldaals Treated AaGaym ... l, 

As might be eqM!Cted thougb, 
most of the research and time was 
spent at Black's Beach, though it is 
not identified as such in the book.

these rules will be subject to

" .. . the dogs that are usually 
noticed are those totally out

DeIpitie the "froma," Oonllaa

old time BIaek's DUdiItI-twomen

DouIIU claJmI that Black's was a

says that, .... ,. were the tint

beach ateIIdvely toda)' , and 
Oouglaa labeled a map in the book 
that had two areas in the noI1h end 
tiUed ''Gay Gulcb," and ''Gay 
DIsplay ." 

As for the other nude beach 
goers, Douglas labels many as 
"cultural libertarians" in that the 
one thing they agree on Is to 
disagree with police power. 
Douglas also notes that from the 
time nude bathing became legal at 
Black's there has been a "more 
and more ,. mixed crowd - one tbat 
Is younger than an average beach 
group. 

You Go Nude Sowly 
Dou8Ias used the analOG' that, 

"Goin, to a nude beach is like 
enlertng a cold I1rirnminI spot-
You put a toe or a foot in one at a 
time unW you eventually ,et UIed 
to It." 

The main emphaaiI that 00011_ 
put on BIaek's ~ aad any

Douglas also dispells some of the 
myths that permeate Black's, 
saying, "It's generally a lousy 
pick-up place for men. Most 
women don't go unescorted, and 
come there with a defeoaive at- . 
titude." AddItionally, he discounts 
the beach as a "overly saual 
arousing place." at least after the 
first several vl.its, sayinl, 
!'Wberever there are people, not 
Only at !lack's, It's a anaaIIy

During the past several years the simple "PH Story" has been told over 
and over. Besides preserving nature's Acid Mantle of 4.5-5.5 ph, 
shampoo must contain NUC[EOPROTEINS DNA and RNA. These 
essential building blocks in the polypeptide chain repair damaged protein 
in the same ratio from which it is natuJally depleted from the hair!! A full 
complement of amino acids, vitamins, minerals, enzymes and coen-
zymes hydrolized to the correct size and weight penetrate the hair shaft 
and are utilized by the NUCLEOPROTEINS to reconstruct hair damage.

repeUed In maintaining proper protective balance.
