The ue Office of the President 

released a new bilingual guide consisting 
of information about the ue system, 
including admissions requirements and 
options for financial aid. The booklet, 
"Great Futures Start Here," or "Un 
Futuro Brilliante Comienza Aqui" is an 
expansion of a previous publication and 
now include information on the Dual 
Admissions Program, which provides 
students with other options for UC eligi-
bility. The new ver ion al 0 updates sru-
dents and t11cir families about current fee

According to studies, many Latino 
parents, especially those who are in the 
lower-income tax bracket and are noo-
English speakers, lack viul information 
about what their children need to get into 
college. 

According to the ueop, the new 
bilingual guide tries to address the lack of 
Imowledge about college within the 
Latino community. It is expected that by 
2008, the largest group of high school 
graduates will be Latinos.

Fees raise student aid questions 
Student orgs ask for increase on federal grant aid 

By CHRISTINE PAE 
Staff Writer 

Upon the onset of the recent 
sUldem fee increase made official 
last july, financial aid programs and 
student organizations have taken 
action to address the issue of 
accommodating UC students who 
are dependent on financial aid. 
Organizations such as CalPIR ,are 
encouraging passage of an amend-
ment to increase federal grants to 
further aid srudents financially. 

The UC Board of Regents' 
decision called for a 30 percent 
in rease in tudent fees . Namely, 
resident undergraduate students 
of the University of California 
must pay an additional $1, ISO, 
causing mandatory systemwide 
fees for resident undergraduates 
to increase to as much as $4,984. 

on resident students also must 
pay regtllar student fees, which 
increased by $1,260 for 2003-04, 
leading average tuition costs to 
climb as high as $19,647 for 
undergraduatt;s and $19,036 for 
graduate students. 

CalPIRG has been active in 
pushing a $SOO increase in the 
federal-based Pell Grant to the 
current $4,000 maximum allowed 
per student receiving it. For the 
past two years, CalPIRG has been 
involved in pushing for this 
amendment to the Higher 
Education Act of 1965. 

"Pell grants are definitely tar-
geted for low-income students, 
and it's helping balance the cost of 
education," said CalPIRG orga-
nizer Kate Gallagher. "Although 
the UC system is a great buy for 
students, it' still very expensive." 

Tuition hikes are not only lim-

ited to California, and have been 
an issue across the country for 
college students. 

"College is becoming more 
and more expensive across the 
board," Gallagher said. "A lot of 
srudenTS work full time, and about 
30 percent of them can't even get 
their degrees because they have to 
work so much ." 

" 

who already receive grants. 
"The California Srudent Aid 

Commission agreed to fully fund 
the fee increase for students receiv-
ing Cal Grant and B at the 
University of California and Cal 
State Universities," aid Vince 
DeAnda, director of financial aid at 
UCSD. "The increa e was equa l to 

These circum-
stances have 
increased concern 
over the welfare of 
students who can-
not meet the 
demands of the 
mandatory fee 
increase. To tackle 
the problem, UC 
financial aid pro-
grams place one-
third of the funds 
from the money 
received from the 
fee increase back 
into the financial 
aid pool. 

Back in 200 1 we 

the total increase 
in mandatory 
state fees and is 
substantial. " 

According to a 
recent ueop 
press release con-
cerning the bud-
get crisis and the 
subsequent UC 
fee increase, 
undergraduate 
students who are 
dependent on 
financial aid and 
come from fami-

According to 
an update from 
the UC Office of 
the President's 
Web site, the 
re ulting increase 
in financial aid 
will significantly 
mitigate the 
impact of the sru-

were able to increase 
the PeU Grant to 
$4000. [Another 

increase] is definitely 
a possibility. With 

the current 
economy, it's defi, 
nitely going to be a 
challenge, but it's a 

winnable 
campaign. " 

- Kate Gallagher. 
caJPIRG organizer 

lies with an 
income of 
$60,000 or less 
will have the fee 
increase covered 
entirely by finan-
cial aid through 
federal and state 
grants. For stu-
dents with an 
income of 
$60,000 to 

dent fee increase for those who 
are financially dependent when 
paying for college tuition. 

ccording to the UCOP, the 
fee increase does not particularly 
affect students who come from 
families with very low incomes, 
since financial aid will cover the 
increase in its entirety for srudents 

$90,000, the fee 
increase will be covered by as much 
as half of the expected fee increase. 
The result is that UC financial aid 
programs will aid as much as 40 
percent of all UC undergraduates. 

The UCSD financial aid office 
has been addressing the fee 
increase this past summer, and has 
been occupied with "re-packag-

ing" su,dent's financial aid grants. 
"We have to increase the fees, 

which changes the students' cost 
of attendance and put together a 
'package,' which includes grants, 
scholarships, loans and work, that 
meets the tude nt's new need," 
DeAnda said. "We had to do this 
for 13 ,000 students, TWIce this 
summer." 

Financial aid consists of feder-
al-based and tate-based grants, as 
well as loans and scholarships. UC 
Fee Grants and the Cal Grant 
cover the mandatory fee increase, 
but federal grants such as the Pell 
Grant are not affected by the fee 
increase. Increases in the Pell 
Grant are mainly determined by 
Congre s, according to DeAnda. 

There are other programs 
available for aid 10 students who 
qualify for them. 

"The Univer ity Student Aid 
Program is the third large grant 
program," DeAnda said. "This 
program is about equa l to the Pell 
Grant and Cal grant programs in 
importance and dollar amount." 

CaIPIRG's lobbying is not only 
limited to increasing federal pend-
ing on financial aid for colleges. 

""Ve're also trying to decrease 
the co t of textbooks, and pushing 
to get more cheap, used books for 
students," Gallagher said. 

The aim to increase federal 
education spending on financial 
aid is difficult but not impos ible, 
according to ealPIRG members. 

"Back in 2001 we were able to 
increase the Pell Grant to $4000," 
Gallagher said. "It's definitely a 
possibility. With the current 
economy, it's definitely going to 
be a challenge, but it is also a 
winnable campaign.

grading 

C lass will no 
longer be taken 
" / " pass no pass 

By VINCENT HSIA 
Staff Writer 

For the first time in Earl Warren 
College history, srudenTS Will only be 
able to take the ~ arren College writ-
ing program classes for a letter grade. 
Out of the six wnting program at 
UCSD, the Warren writing program 
was previously the only one offered in 
only a "pass or no pass" grading ys-
tern. 

Warren writing's pass or no pas 
grading policy has been an i sue of 
debate for a number of year. In late 
April 2003, the Committee on 
Educational Policy, a branch of the 
Academic enate, agreed for a change. 
By June, when Warren College was 
notified of the deCision, it was tOO late 
in the school year to consult with 
"Varren faculty, according to Warren 
Provost Daniel Jordan. 

"1 think [having only letter grades] 
would encourage srudents to devole 
more energy :lnd focus to the cilss," 
said humanities professor teven Cox, 
who was the Chairman of CEP at the 
time of the decision.

the state's own budget woes 
while over a half billion dol-
lars is being cut from the 
State-University 
Partnership funding that 
accounts for student enroll-
ment and growth. 

Currently, fees are 40 per-
cent higher than last year, 
srudem enrollment growth is 
frozen and programs are 
being cut or completely di s-
mantled. Fee hike proposals 
were swirling a~ when the 
Regents met VIa conference 
caLI on Sept. 17. For the 
University of California, a 20 
percent fundin~ shortfall 
would be an additional $570 
million cut from its budget 

Davis' request for the sce-
narios is a desperate attemp t 
to find a quick fix for the 
economic crisis just as many 
of the other gubernatorial 
candidates nave done. 
Another 20 percent cut in 

the governor' January bud-
get proposal will force the 
Regents to raise fees - the 
foUrth increase in the past 
year. 

While the University of 
California's financial aid pro-
grams should not go without 
recognition for being fair 
(students from households 
with less than $60,000 annu-
al income will not absorb the 
increase if they apply for the 
UC Grants), another 
increase equals another 
headache for many 
California families who have 
already compromised their 
budget three times in the 
past year. Meanwhile, those 
families that will get addi-
tional assistance must again 
face tile toils of the UC 
bureaucracy, multiple "ifs" 
and deadlines that accompa-
ny financial aid applications. 

Davis must put 
California's students ahead 
of any aspirations he has for 
a quick fix to save the 
economy - or his job. 

Rebuilding Iraq creates 
potential financial woes 

I n his speech to the nation on Sept. 15, President George W 
Bush declared his intention 
to a k Congress for $87 bil-
lion to cover military oper-
ations and reconstruction in 
Iraq and Mghanistan over 
the next year. 

This demand for funding 
is liable to increase the 
already soaring national debt 
- a debt compounded by 
the Bush tax cut. According 
to the Congressional Budget 

ffice, half of this year's 
$400 billion budget deficit i 
due to Bush tax cuts. Money 
to rebuild Iraq has to come 
from somewhere, and the 
options are to borrow or to 
tax. 

It' a bleak situation. War 
has already been waged and 
the nited tates is obligat-
ed to finish what it started. 
But when gi\'en the choice 
between raising taxes on a 
country with one of the 

highest standards of living 
or rislcing financial stability 
in order to payoff enor-
mous debts, the decision 
isn't a fuzzy. f t the very 
least, the White House 
should report back to 
Congress to account for the 
spending, thereby avoiding 
accusations like those found 
in a recent report by the 
CBO showing that only 
about $2.5 billion of the $4 
billion being spent monthly 
on the war can be account-
ed for. 

Some will insist that 
Bush i not making the e 
request in ignorance of 
financial concern, but that 
the a erage citizen cannot 
see the long-term view and 
that we hould all simply 
tru t what our pre ident IS 
doing becau e of hi posi-
tion . It' that ki nd f CIrCU-
lar logic that caused this 
finanCial fiasco in the fir 
place.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
"Jizzlam" offensive to 

Muslim women 
1 am extremely disgusted and 

appalled by the horrific 16-page 
newspaper Jizz/n1lt. The newspa-
per was extremely racist and 
degrading to Muslims, particular-
I)' Muslim women . As a Muslim ' 
woman, each day is a struggle to 
fight against the derogatory 
remarks. This newspaper is 
enriched with such ~epulsive 
remarks. This is no doubt a hate 
crime. It must be stopped . I feel 
that this newspaper violated my 
rights and my security on campus. 
I demand that our university con-
duct a full investigation and pun-
ish the e ill-minded individual . 

-Aliha Khan 
Earl Warren College smi07' 

Publication only adds 
to existing hate 
There was a newspaper dis-

tributed on campus [at the end of 
spring 2003] that was solely based 
on putting down Muslims in the 
most obscene way that one could 
imagine. There are not enough 
words to express how this affects 
our campus. For starters, it adds 
to the continuous hate speech 
that exi ts on our campus that has 
occurred against various types of 
minorities. Secondly, it goes 
against everything Muslims stand 
for, especially Muslim women . 
Being a Muslim who covers, I 
have never felt more violated in 
my life. I cannot even believe 
someone would use so much 
money and take so much time to 
produce such an obscene thing -
and not even put their name on it! 
You know it's because the), know 
it's wrong, hurtful, disrespectful 
and just plain unacceptable. I 
think the guilty need to stand up 
and take responsibility for their 
actions and accept the conse-
quences. 

Or at least, if anyone has infor-
mation, do everyone a favor and 
report it!

Offending authors 
must be punished 
As an alumna of UC D, I am 

dishea.rtened to learn that a hate-
filled newspaper displaying 
Muslim women conducting lewd 
sexual acts wa een all over the 
UCSD campus [at the end of 
spring 2003]. 

At an instirution that purports 
to ciVIlize its srudents a.nd help 
them marure into fine men and 
women, this type of behavior 
must not only be condemned, but 
it must be punished. 

A resolution is not enough. 
The students responsible for cre-
ating and disseminating such hor-
rific material should be appre-
hended and punished severely.

srudents who are trying to live 
morally and modestly? The entire 
Muslim community is outraged, 
but there are Mu lim girl on the 
UCSD campus that need your 
support. I wa one of tho e girls 

last year. l Ow, r look at them 
with concern and on ly a simple

Hijab unfairly 
portrayed by paper 
On Wednesday, June 4, 3,000 

copies of a 16-page newspaper 
enti tied Jizzlam: All 
Emertflill'l1le11l Magazhle for tbe 
Islamic Mflll appeared on the 
UCSD campus portra),ing 
Muslim women wearing hijab 
(the Islamic clothing ~ r women) 
performing lewd sexual acts. As a 
Muslim W0l113l1 who practice; the 
hijab, I felt violated, disgu ted, 
humiliated and defamed. 

This publication attacked Illy 
very being, and everything th~t 
the hijab acttlally stands for: mod-
esty and respect. Throughout hi -
tory, women have been portrayed 
as nothing more than sex objects 
and with the advent of I lam 1400 
years ago, the hijab came as a 
form of liberation and protection 
for women . It was to help people 
look past the exterior and see 
women for the real spiritual, 
intellectual human beings that 
they are, and that tile}, be treated 
as dignified equals participating 
in society. 

In this sense, I have never felt 
more personally dehumanized 
and vu lnerable on campus as 
when I saw the Jizzlam publica-
tion. Some of my Muslim sisters 
had to leave U 0 because they 
just couldn't walk around that day 
thinking people might be associ-
ating their dress with the obscene 
image; inside the newspaper. For 
all those who want to tell us, 
"This is America, get used to it," 
we'd like to ask them, what if this 
publication was about your reli-
gion, about your race, about your 
mother? And by the way, many of 
US were born and raised here, 0 
please don't tell us about America 
like we don 't speak E nglish or 
understand the Constitution. 

We are a campus about pro-
moting education, not one that 
protects the ignorance and hate-
mongering of a few at the expense 
of the well-being of other inno-
cent students. 

Racism, discrimination and 
degradation of any group on cam-
pus should not be tOlerated .

nJESDAY, SEPTEMBER ZJ, ZooJ THE UCSO OUARDIAN OPINION AS 

First-years have a lot to learn about freshman life 
UCSD becomes center of political power, predictions of controversy, societal trends 

horse's 
mouth 

A 
EdWu 

s UCSD opens its doors to 
another round of progres-
sively more ambitious and 

bener groomed freshmen, the 
more jaded of those remaining 
from years past are reminded that 
much of our fir t year was a 
monumental waste of time. 

Wide-eyed IS-year-olds are 
probabl)' receiving more than 
enough unsolicited advice, regard-
ing everything from amassing 
quarters for the dryers, to the mer-
its of abstinence, to the risks of 
keeping large mammals (boyfriends 
and girlfriends included) in one's 
dorm room. Most of this advice is 
geared at preserving the fragile 
mental well-being of these quiver-
ing IS-year-olds. Full disclosure-
thi ; columnist really has no (well, a 
little) regard for mental well-being. 
He ju t really wants to see this 
school be a bit more lively. As such, 
here's a tist of advice for the more 
masochistic of freshmen. 

I. The very first thing you 
should do on Thursday when 
classes start, is sign up for another 
cia s. Your freshman cia ses are a 
joke and you have more than 
enough work ethic and talent to 
attempt 20 units. The extra four 
units do not even have to be relat-
ed at all to your major or your 
ambition to become a doctor or 
lawyer. Just try something - it's all 
the same price (money-wi c, not 

sanity-wise) and you might very 
well reap the benefits in getting a 
jump start on that next masochistic 
step, a double major. Or you might 
just find out you are much more 
talented at vector integrals than 
you will ever be at writing modern 
poetry. 

2. Do not tver go to discussion 
unless you are required to. While 
this may seem like a nonmasochis-
tic step (i.e. you'll get more sleep), 
the vast majority of "discussion sec-
tions" are th.inly veiled excuses for 
TAs to hand out answers to sru-
dents that are too lazy to think for 
themselves. You'll get a lot more 
traction Out of thinking for 
yourself. 

Discussion sections are like 
drugs - the more you use them, 
the more dependent you get. 
Sooner or later, they'll take them 
away from you (unless you're an 
engineering major, in which case 
they have to keep giving you dis-
cussion ections for fear you won't 
graduate). When it comes to dis-
cussion sections, just say no. 

3. If you are Asian, make sure 
you drink milk every few days. 
Otherwise you will evenrually look 
in the mirror and all you will see is 
a jaded, lacrose-intolerant colum-
nist. Or if you're really masochistic, 
don 't drink milk for a year, and 
then try half a gallon. 

4. Join a srudent organization 
of some lcind and put obscene 
amounts of time into it (regardless 
if you have a job that acrualty 
makes you money). Student orga-
nizations are generally divided 
into two categories: those who 
think they are affecting some-
thing, and those who openly pro-
fess they are doing jack for soci-

,.,.,., 

/1.6e l!!inceton Review 

ety. A.S . Council, CalPIRG and 
the editorial board of a certain 
srudent newspaper fall into the 
former category, while the ulti-
mate Frisbee team and the science 
fiction club Darkstar fall into the 
latter. 

If you enjoy spending much of 
your time in a room making broad 
generalizations about the nature of 
society and the worth of individuals 
while yelling at other people, the 
former group of orgs is for you. 
Otherwise, if you like to run 
around in circles for a Frisbee or 
roll dice testing agai nst your dex-
terity stat on whether or not you 
will catch that Frisbee, the latter 
group of orgs is for you. 

There are a few organizations 
that do acrually do things for people 
in need. This columnist knows they 
exist somewhere on campus, but 
cannot acrually point to any off the 
top of his head (there are religious 
clubs that do great amounts of 
community service, but for you 
agnostics or worshi ppers of pagan 
Celtic gods, that might not be for 
you) . Tangential to this disc'Jssion 
is that some organizations do 
plenty of drugs. 

There is a rather ea y litmus test 
for the uninitiated as to whether 
you're getting yourself into some-
thing you'd rather not (or some-
thing you're looking for). Simply 
start by fir t aslcing: Is this UCSD 
srudent organization a media club 
(i.e. does it put out something on 
newsprint, or the airwaves for gen-
eral consumption)? 

If the answer is "yes," then you 
have found an organization with 
plenty of illicit substances to be 
supplied to all comers. 

Congratl!lations. 

U CSD is undoubtedly the red-hot prophetic center of California politics. To 
illustrate this, I cite two examples 
of this campus' recognitive skills 
with regards to the California 
gubernatorial race . First, then 
Lieutenant Governor (but soon to 
be leading candidate!) Cruz 
Bustamante spoke at the Thurgood 
Marshall College commencement 
this year. Undoubtedly, Mr. 
Bustamante realized the geopoliti-
cal significance of our fair campu 
in the run-up to the election . 

Secondly, May's A.S . election 
was the debut of a tactic that would 
ultimatel), find its way into a politi-
cal venue with ( orne) acrual signif-
icance: the use of the run-a-guy-
wi th -the-sam e- na me-as-a - fron-
uu nne r-a nd -co n fusc-t he -e lec-
tora te -and-or- rna ke-a-mockery-
out-of the-election-process tactic. 
fnitially used by opponents of 
Kevin Shawn Hsu on this very 
campus, the tactic foreshadowed 
the numerous Gray Davis-es from 
around the state who filed papers 
with the intent of running for gov-
ernor in the recall election. 

Fellow students, UC D is back 
on the map. ure, we've had a few 
years since Newt Gingrich and Bill 
Clinton visited in the mid-90s that 
showed us how marginal and 
insignificant the campus was, the 
climax of which was a rousing 
glimpse of the magnificent white ass 
of none other than Dr. Patch Adams 
himself. 

This is all to say that Davis (the 
real one) no doubt made a fatallni -
rake in his campaign by opening the 
"truth amI reconciliation" (read: "I 
kind of apologize, but it's really the 
fault of the Texas energy compa-

egies you need 

nies") portion of his campaign at 
UCLA. Everybody in the know real -
i7..es that this is the epicenter of where 
everything is happening - and ro 
guarantee that UCSD clings ro its 
perch atop statewide politics, UCSD 
srudcnts should vote yes on recall , 
and yes on Bustamante. Or yes to 
one of the numerous name ri p-off 
candidates. Or even yes to this 
columnist's ediror, Damel \.yans, a 
UCSD srudent who is himself run-
ning to make a mockery of the polit-
ical process - er, to demonstrate the 
value of civic participation. 

That probably merits full dis-
closure. Mr. Watts and this writt:r 
arc on rather cordial terms, having 
worked at a certain srudent new -
paper together for quite some time. 
In fact, a few years ago, Mr. Wans 
and this writer gOt bikini waxes 
together and posed for some 
German bodybuilding magazines 
naked . Come to think of it, some of 
this writer's responses to the inter-
view questions were probably a bit 
less than politically correct. 

As students, we can only hope 
that either those magazines never 
get found, or no one learns how to 
read German - the expo ure of this 
columnist a a politically in en itive 
hack could do untold damage to the 
political legitimacy of this fine un i-
versity. That university tllat really 
does matter in national politics. 
What does UCSD stand for again ?

Recall's critics ignore 
democratic virtues 

By CHRIS TAYLOR 
Senior staff writer 

Those who were at UCSD to 
witness last year's A. . election 
need no one to tell them that the 
definition of democracy in 
California is increasingly prone to 
debate. Thi become even more 
apparent when court system are

" 

With so much yelling, it is 
extremely difficult to get a bearing 
on who are the defenders and 
opponents of democracy. 

Because the spokespersons for 
each candidacy use sound bytes [0 
campaign, there is no time for 
study of the recall's long and 
involved history. Most ill-informed 
are those who say the recall is 
undemocratic. The recall was start-

back sharply and 
almost violently, 
saying that their

end, the definition

Someone needs to

Someone needs 

to define democracy for us

Dynes brings leadership 
Chancellor's tenure marked by charisma 

By CLAIRE J. VANNEnE 
Senior staff writer 

At the end of the month, 
UCSD will bestow upon the 
University of California at large a 
gift: its leader. 

Robert C. D ynes, UCSD 
chancellor ince 1995, was named 
inJune the next UC president. He 
packs his bags and leaves our 
sunny campus on Oct. I . VYhile 
the departure is disappointing in 
that it deprives the UCSD com-
munity of a magnetic and some-
times inspiri ng chief, it is a far, far 
better thing he does now than he 
has ever done before. Dynes is 
uniquely suited [0 the role of UC 
president, for reasons personal 
and professional. 

It would be condescending [0 
call one of Dynes' many qualities 
"the common touch," but it is true 
that his background and attirude 
are more hockey rink than ivory 
tower. Dynes' humble beginnings 
- h is mother was a nursery 
school teacher and his fa ther a 
shoe salesman, and he was the first 
in his family [0 attend college -
have given him humility and per-
spective. 

Dynes has said, "I am a first-
generation college graduate whose 
life was transformed by education 
opporrunity," and the personal 
narure of his commitment [0 edu-
cation, and his affection for and 
comfort with rudents, ha been 
clear. hi star ro e in the CSD 
physics deparrment, he till regu-
larly taught lower-division cours-
e ; when he became chancellor, he 
mamtained a lab on campus and 
worked closely "'ith undergradu-
ate and graduate snldents, a king 

everyone to call him "Bob· ... Dynes 
has always been approacha ble to 
students, whether scheduling 
cha ts in his office or looking up 
for a moment from tlle coffee he 
regularly enjoys near Mandeville. 

While he has been criticized 
for an unsophisticated speaking 
style ( orne have urged him to take 
speech classes), his straight talk is 
endearing - and deceptive. It 
reveals his passion, but belies his 
shrewdnes . He i accessible and 
genia l, but behind the jokes and 
occasional stumblings, he is always 
in concrol of the discussion or 
interview. 

This sharpness has been one of 
the contributing factors to his suc-
cess, as has hi ability to move in 
many circles. It would be very easy 
to cast Dynes as the aw- hucks-
lowe r- mid d I e-c1 a ss - pro fesso r-
turned -acciden ta I-ad mi nistra tor, 
but this would be to deny him one 
of his grea test talents: schmooz-

ing~ 
When asked what the chan-

cell or does, D yne would some· 
times smile and say he wasn't 
really sure, bur it boiled down to 
meetings, meetings, and more 
meetings. UCSD is a major force 
in San Diego, so it's natural that 
its chancellor should be a promi-
nent figure in the county. Dynes 
interact ea ily with educators, 
bu iness people and politicia ns. 
He has establi shed many ties 
between UC D and the ur-
rounding community - e pc· 
cially the bu iness community-
and his uccess in forging bonds 
with big names is due in no small 
part to his personal charisma and 
energy level. 

\Vith big names often comes 

big money, and thi i another 
one of Dynes' st rengths. 
Fundraising has been a major 
issue at UCSD during his tenure 
as chan ell or; he established the 
goa l of raisin g $1 billion for the 
campus by 2007, then promptly 
reached the h alfway Illark on hi 
own. Collecting cash for the uni -
versity's ever-shrinki ng budget 
will be crucial to ensuring con-
tinued academic excell e nce, and 
Dynes has shown a knack for 
raking it in . 

Another of Dynes' many quali -
fications for the presidency and 
something that was cited by the 
Regents as a reason for his selec-
tion, i his familiarity with the 
troubled Los Alamos and 
Lawrence Livermore ational 
Laboratories. The twO labs, which 
are at the forefront of weapons 
research in the United States, have 
late ly been beset by secu ri ty,

Dynes has advised and overseen 
the labs for years, and will not 
need to play catch-up with respect 
to charting th e future of the labo-

Dynes ha not esca ped con-
troversy as UCSD chancellor. 
Conservatives decry hi ecming 
continued allegia nce to affirma-
t ive action, so me on the left

wedded tech sector inrcre tS with 
the future of the ullivcr~itv, and 
he has gone toe-to-lOc ' with 
organizations like the American

Political intrigue pervades UCSD climate 
Apathy overcome by uncovering shadiness of campus organizations 

BY DANIEL WATTS 
Opinion Editor 

SAAC. MEChA. ASUCSD. 
UCAB. To the uninitiated, UCSD 
can seem like a jungle of obscure 
abbreviations. Only the activist few 
know of the political intrigue that 
accompanies these assortments of 
letters. In a university much 
maligned for its general lack of 
school spirit, the best way to feel a 
sense of attachment is to know 
UCSD inside and Out, accepting 
the good along with the bad. 

Student Affinnative Action 
Committee (SAAC): An umbrel-
la group consisting of a half dozen 
student-run cultural organiza-
tions. During much of the year, it's 
an innocuous group of students 
who want nothing more than to 
socialize with other students of 
their respective culrures. But come 
election season, SAAC transforms 
into a political machine, rivaling 
the juggernaut of New York's Boss 
Tweed in the mid- 19th century. 

For the past two years, SAAC 
has given its unwavering endorse-
ment to Students First!, a slate of 
candidates comprised in large part 
of the leaders of SAAC cultural 
groups. The leaders use their posi-
tions to deliver the votes of their 
respective groups to the slate as a 
whole, often ensuring victory for 
Students First! candidates. 

SAAC's influence in getting out 
the vote dwindled this past year, as 
many Srudents First' candidates 
running ullopposed were seeming-
ly assured victory. Even with the 
hotly contested student govern-
ment presidency, the AAC-
backed candidate won a plurality 

by a mere 50 votes out of the cou-
ple thousand cast. 

Join a SAAC club if you like 
free food and meeting people, but 
don't get into a leadership position 
unless you're prepared to deal with 
untold amounts of political 
shenanigans. 

The Associated Students of 
the University of California -
San Diego (ASUCSD): Often 
referred to as the 

" 

ing perrnits. 
The A.S. Counci l is usually 

dominated by partisan politics, 
embodied at UCSD as student 
political parties like the Students 
First ! machine. This yea r marks 
the first in a while where indepen-
dent candidates and minor parties 
managed to wrest control of the 
council from the well - funded 
established parties. The entire 

Students First! 
A.S. Council, or 
simply "A.S.," 
ASUCSD is the 
most popular way 
to waste time and 
spend other peo-
ple's money among 
overly ambitious 
political science 
majors. The coun-
cil spends much 
time and money 
pretending to be 
important, last 
year spending 
thousands of dol -

ASUCSD is the 

machine was dis-
qualified for ille-
gal campaigning 
in last year's elec-
tion, leaving to 
the second-place 
presidential candi -
date and his hand-
ful of senators the 
daunting task of 
appointing half 
the council. With 
the demise of trav-
el-happy Students 
First!, it was shap-
ing up to be a year 

most popular way to 
waste time and 

spend other people's 
money among overly 

ambitious political

saence maJors. 
lars on trips across 
the country to " network" with 
other schools' pretend politicians. 

While ASUCSD is technically 
an advisory body, with the chan-
cellor holding veto power over 
how money is spent, they' re rarely 
bothered by administration inter-
ference . This year's $1.3 million 
A.S. budget includes over $30,000 
in contributions to state and 
national political lobbying groups 
and over $20,000 on travel expens-
es for A.S . Council members. 
They pay themselves about 
$60,000 a year in salaries for doing 
the people 's work, and the four 
executive officers enjoy free park-

free from extrane-
ous student-funded vacations, 
until failed presidential candidate 
and Students First! figurehead 
Kevin Hsu was appointed 
"National Affairs Director" last 
spring. Now we can look forward 
to paying for a year's worth of trips 
to D .C., but at least Hsu is happy. 

The People's Parking Party 
(PPP): Independent student polit-
ical party in last year's election, 
running a single issue campaign. 
While none of the PPP candidates 
won their poSitions outright, the 
wholesale disqualification of 
Students First' allowed Eric 
Webster, a man running with no 

relevant A.S. experience, to slip in 
~s Vice President Fin~nce. 
Webster was a quick study, and has 
learned the ins and outs of the 
p osition with littl e trouble . 
Though the PPP's future electoral 
prospects are dim, it's important to 
note Webster's success. When all 
is said and done, this is still only 
student government and Webster 
proves that experience is not a pre-
requisite for competence. 

Movimiento Estudiantil 
Chicano de ALtlan (MEChA): 
Often misspelled, always mispro-
nounced, MEChA's most recent 
claim to fame is Lieutenant 
Governor Cruz Bustamante's mem-
bership in the I 970s. MEChAS stat-
ed political views border on racist 
- its founding documents, includ-
ing EI Plan de Santa Barbara and EI 
Plan Espiritual de Aztlan, repeated-
ly slam the "Anglo society" and 
denounce the "gringo invaders" of 
the "bronte continent" - although 
the organization 's UCSD incarna-
tion rarely lives up to the hype. 

In 2002, UCSD 's MEChA filed 
charges through the UCS D judi-
cial system against the KDala, a 
sati rical newspaper, for "disru pt-
ing" an open meeting by taking 
photographs of a MEChA leader. 
After national media coverage 
favoring the Koala, MEChA lost its 
case and faded back into relative 
obscurity. But like most SAAC 
orgs, MEChA is primarily a cul-
ture-based social group. It'll occa-
sionally stir up controversy, but 
the most virulent anti-"gringo" 
propaganda comes not from 
MEChA, but from the radical

on campus. T hese are weighty 
concerns that will give pause to 
many as he takes charge of the 
most prestigious public university 
in the world. 

But what may be Dynes' 
grea test strength is tha t he is 
open to criticism. He is genui ne-
ly interested in establishing a dia-
logue with those with whom he 
disagrees, and will concede a 
point when it is elsewhere won. 
The 2002-03 Academic Senate 
Chair Joel Dimsdale said of 
D ynes, "He's the sort of chancel· 
lor who believes that God gave us 
two ears and one mouth and he 
remembers that. He listens very 
well." Listening to outside input 
and then taking a decisive stance 
is something Dynes has always 
done, and it's something he will 
need to do as UC president. 

Ultimately, Dynes' career as 
UC president is wide open. He 
will be faced with many serious 
challenges and controversies and it 
is ye t unclear, of course, what his 
term will bring. 

Outgoing UC President 
Richard C. Atkinson will undoubt-
ed ly be remembered for his 
aggressive pursuit of alternatives 
to affirmative action and pushing 
for changes [0 the AT I. While 
Dynes may not emerge as 
Atkinson did , in the national Spot-
light as 3 standard-bearer and 
lightning rod, he will be as uncom-
promising in pursuing hi goal for 
the Universiry of Califo rnia .

the 2003 ASUCSD elections. 
Beginning in 1998, the pany domi-

until it was ousted by an aU-Greek

point the board was dissolved and 
UCAB was formed. 

Proud UCAB members will tell

ond candidate named "Kevin Hsu," 
running under the Srudents First! 
club's banner. The club Hsu drew 
over 300 VOtes, most likely from 
confused voters intending to vote for

brand is somewhat tarnished now, 
but it will probably again rear its

of students primarily appointed by

body erves in a mere "advisory" 
capacity, as cvidenced by the "A" in

the Univer ity Centers Board and

There are dozens of other

THE UCSD GUARDIAN TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 23, 2003 

Students play the numbers game 
Selectively chosen statistics belie academic flaws 

Evelyn Hsieh 

E very late August or so, I peruse the magazine racks of Barnes and Noble in 
search of the U. News and 
World Report: "America's Best 
Colleges Special Edition ." In 
high school, that intimidating 
title would beckon me to reli -
giously scour each and every 
page for informa tion on college 
admissions - admit rate per-
centages, average SAT scores, 
and of course, the infamous 
rankings. 

I'd either glumly flip through 
page after page of profiles of bril-
liant Nobel-prizewinners-to-be 
Harvard freshmen, or smugly 
breathe a sigh of rel ief when my 
SAT scores registered much high-
er than the average of some of the 
schools in the top fifty. 

The rankings were the brain-
child of a few clever, enterprising 
executives over at U .S News some 
twenty years ago. Quite correctly, 
they figured college-minded ado-
lescents and their freaking-out 
parents would snap up their 
soaped-up magazine for just one 
week, and for ake ewsweek or 
Time in favor of thei r tll ird-tier 
newsweekly. 

As the years progres ed, col-
leges proudly began publicizing 
their U.S N ew ranking, such as 

umber 49 in the Mo t Diverse 
Western Region Bachelo r 's 
Degree Liberal Arts Coll ege 

category, or something equally 
ob cure. But hey, it was recogni-
tion. Harvard or Princeton didn't 
need to be told they're the best. 
Like in the superlative "Mosts" 
section of high school yearbooks, 
the overshadowed colleges could 
reli h in their less important, 
arguably meaningless, but equally 
publiCized distinction. 

" With a somewhat 
credible prestige comes a 
disheartening numbers, 

based picture that UCSD 
has overfilled c/ruses full 
of apathetic and stingy 

students. " 
Nowadays, I look at the annu-

al rankings to see how UCSD 
does, so I can glower in the fact 
that it's still higher than NYU, 
but secretly scorn that we're still 
behind UCLA. As many nothing-
bener-to-do, 10 cr-rific college 
students or more likely, collcge-
bound kids (and I'm gues ing, 
even more so, parents of these 
kids) laboriously pore over the 
is ue, they'll di scover our 
beloved UCSD to be umber 32 
in the Nati onal Doctoral 
U ni versiti es ca tegory. 

T he ranking th at the C D 
admini tration likes to trumpet 
from va lley to va lley, though, is 

umber 7 in Top Pu blic 

Universities. U SD has perenni -
ally been stuck at this position: 
not bad for a barely 40-year-old 
institution but still not as nation-
ally prestigious as our UCLA or 
Berkeley counterparts. Its safe to 
say that if you tell some non-
Cali fornia resident that you go to 
UCSD, they might not even 
know what school you're ta lking 
about. 

If you want to play the num-
bers game further, it might be of 
interest to note that, among the 
top fifty schools, UCSD is one of 
the colleges with the lowest per-
centage of classes under twenty 
students, with one of the highest 
percentages of classes over fifty 
students, and highest student-to-
faculty ratios. We are also in the 
deep dark abyss of alumni -giving 
rates (I won't state the exact num -
bers as to not cheat those conniv-
ing magazine executives of tlleir 
own hard-earned money). 

You won't hear any UCSD 
administrator advertising any of 
those figures, I assure you . With 
somewhat credible pre tige comes 
a disheartening numbers-based 
picture that UCSD ha overfilled 
c1asse full of apathetic and stingy 
students. 

I never envi sioned my pre-
cious school to be this way, and 
this is why I found these numbers 
to be quite surpri ing. Yet, the 
numbers also beg the ques tion, 
"Wh y'" How do you expl ain 
such a di pa rity? And more 
importantly, are these numbers 
indicative of th e quali ty of 
academics and student life here al

11JESDAY, SEPTEMBER 23, 2003 THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION A9 

College students too insistent on total sensitivity 
Today's generation finds ways to be offended by everyone and everything 

Returned 
yank 

Chris Taylor 

Y ankee is an interesting word. It is used for two diametricall y opposite 
purposes. It serves as both a point 
of pride and patriotism, as well as 
the mo t widely-used derogatory 
slur against Americans. 

When someone is called a Yankee 
or a Yank, the resulting emotions 
may be confusing. If used negative-
ly, it doesn't necessarily have the 
poignancy that it should, because it 
doubles as a patriotic symbol. Of 
course, if you have to think about 
whether or not to be offended, it's 
probably not worth being offended 
at all. 

Such is the problem with US col-
lege srudents. We spend way too 
much time being offended, trying 
to find ways to be offended, and 
trying to decide if we are offended. 

There are many reasons why 
srudents are this way. One reason is 
that students want, above all else, 
to be revolutionary. We will go to 
the ends of the earth to be anti -
establishment and to rise up in 
romantic resistance, changing the 
world and being generally ignored 
by most other members of society. 

In order to be revolutionary, 
one must be offended by every-
thing that is considered se.lf-evi-
dent in society. T hus, we can con-
stantly complain about how the 
establishment is evil. For example, 
it may be obvious that calling 

undocumented workers illegal 
immigrants is common sense, in 
that they are both immigrants and 
illegal. Thankfully, however, revo-
lutionary students can step up to 
the plate, be offended, and then 
inform us that this description is, in 
fact, evil. 

Despite our fanatical attempts 
at open-mindedness, we react sur-
prisingly poorly to the ramifica-
tions, both good and bad , of 
diversity. 

Diversity, while extremely 
enlightening, is a difficul t thing to 
adjust to, especially for many who 
grew up in an environment that 
was in any way segregated. From 
diversity, even the most embold-
ened, tolerant, revolutionary stu-
dent will feel offended from time to 
time. The problem at UCSD is 
how badly we react to the pains of 
diversity. 

Increasing diversity is the mod-
ern holy grail of most U.S. univer-
sities. Diversity is a way of allowing 
students to interact with other Stu-
dents who often live differently, 
teaching them to understand dif-
ferent customs and allowing Stu-
dents to freely express their her-
itage and tradition. 

It is an undoubtedly construc-
tive experience, but as in all things, 
not without its pitfalls. Diversity, 
by its very definition, must bring 
about some offensive siruations. 

From the beginning of time, 
humans have had problems accept-
ing those appearing or acting dif-
ferently. Until the last several hun-
dred years, every war was more or 
less about genocide. In fact, it is 
perhaps remarkable that we have 
had any success at all in accepting 
diversity. But as any revolutionary 

student will tell you, we aren 't fin-
i hed yet. They should know. 

It's still very difficult to accept 
different points of view, a fact that 
is only exacerbated by the incredi-
ble degree of freedom we are given 
in this country to say what we feel 
and to defend even extreme view-
points. 

For example, it is impossible to 
establish a Muslim Srudent 
Association as well as the Union of 
Jewish Students in close proximity 

" Despite our fanatical 
attempts at operHninded, 
ness , we react surprsingly 

poorly to .. . diversity." 

without an innate level of awk-
wardness. Furthermore, to allow 
each of them the freedom to 
express their heritage and culrure 
will inevitably create offensive situ-
ations. Any Jewish support of set-
tlements in Palestinian territory 
may offend srudents of the MSA, 
particularly those of Palestinian 
heritage. To the U]S, it is no doubt 
offensive that the MSA refuses to 
condemn suicide bombings target-
ing the innocent. 

While it is something of an 
achievement that a campus can 
support the coexistence of these 
groups, it should be understood 
that there will be turbulence along 
the way. This is a significantly bet-
ter alternative to the more com-
mon student reaction: pleading 10 

Recall: Definition of democracy unclear 
continued from page A6 

at a local level. Mo t interestingly 
however, is that despite the lack of 
success, every single California 
governor in the last 30 year has 
faced a recall attempt. Therefore, 
questioning the legitimacy of the 
recall is absurd, at least in refer-
ence to its existence in the 
California Constitution. Also, 
referring to the recall as a tOol of a 
vast right conspiracy is incorrect, 
considering that several 
Republican governors have had 
recall attempts mounted against 
them as well. 

It i , however, highly ironic 
that present-day Republicans are 
those who are wielding the recall. 
The amendment is indeed pop-
ulist, the antithe is of modern 
Republican thinking. Many con-
servative ideological purists, such 
as veteran pundit George Will , 
have denounced the recall as 
hypocritical when used by 
Republican . These thinkers, 
now trange bedfellow with 
Davis upporte rs, till be l ieve 
that the embattl ed governor 
houl d be all owed to fin ish his 

term despite hIS hort o llling , 
and ideologica ll y, they are 
ab o lutely correct. 

T here is li ttle doubt that the 
initiators of the recall were merely 
sore loser . T here is much reason 
lO be sore, especially after the 
2002 election . ali o rni a 
RepublIcans, in a tupefying move, 
chose Bill Si mon, who - in a 
wonderfu l displ a}' of fa ilu re 
lic!.plle the odds - IWlr the guber-
natoria l race to lhe woefully 
unpopular Davi . 

And, in fac t, the reca ll gai ned 
little momentum un til twO Impor-
tant events took place: the cn~ct­
lIlent of the car t, by the cold and 
hapless Davi , and the promotion 
of the recall m vemenl by nch 
Republi all ,su h as Rep. Darrell 

Issa (R - CA). And while the initial 
motive behind the recall is sus-
pect, it has nothing to do with the 
validity of the recall , constitution-
ally or democratically. 

Others argue that the ramifica-
tions of the recall over hadow its 
usefulness. There could be many 
retaliatory recalls following this 
one, and a renewed sense of 
urgency to merely remove those 
whom you can't get rid of by elec-
tion. This is true and extremely 
poignant in a time when America is 
becoming increasingly polarized. 
This doesn't even consider the extra 
financial burden, which is one of 
the reasons Davis is being recalled. 

Again, however, it is incorrect to 
say that the idea of a recall is unde-
mocratic. The people are getting to 
vote, in an amendment passed 
democratically by elected officials, 
for one of 135 different candidates. 

It is true that the amendment is 
antiquated, but it ha n 't been 
repealed democratically, and thus it 
i valid. If it were that important, it 
would have been repealed long ago. 

ow if people decide the poli tical 
consequences are tOO heavy, it \vi ll 
be repealed on. But for now, It is 
legal and obviou I functional. 

Ilowever, none of this I t say 
that there aren 't plenty o f unde-
moc ratic goings-on. T he 
American court ystem, III the sci f-
ri ghte us move of all self- n ghl-
CO liS moves, has seemingly decid-
ing that it should be writmg our 
legislation fo r us. In an intriguing-
ly bIpartisa n spiri t, both con erva-
tive courts and lIberal courts have 
thrown constitu tional mterpreta-
tion out the wmd w in fav r of 
CIVI l rights , tiVlsm, e~cept with 
more power ami less checks and 
halance . 

For ex mpl e, the uprcmc 
Court, a liber Ily-pr laimed b -
tlon of on erv;)tl Ill, d cHleu to 
wave th flag of CIvIl right 

activi m and upheld the rac ist 
affirmative action, only slapping 
the wrists of a college that gave 
more points for being a srudent of 
color than scoring a perfect T 
score. 

And now, the inth Circui t 
Court of Appeals, which has long 
si nce abandoned democracy by 
repeatedly overrurning the will of 
the people, decided to disenfran-
chise hundreds of thousands of 
voters more than punch card bal-
lots ever would by delaying the 
vote. 

With 135 candidates on the 
ballot, and possibly more as the 
deadline for candidacy filing is 
moved back as the recall amend-
ment requires, as well as at least 10 
major Democratic primal)' candi-
dates on one ballot, the idea of 
holding off a ballot until March 
would be a nightmare, confusing 
to political cience profe sors, but 
even more so to minori ties and the 
poverty-stricken. 

The simple truth that judges, 
both conservative and liberal, are 
fo rgetting in our country is that 
thei r job is to interpret the 
Con tirution, not enforce legisla-
ti on. Enfo rci ng Judicia l will I 
more resemblIng of dIctatOr hip 
than democracy, regardlc of the 
ideology. 

In the end, the re all amend-
ment is antiquated and popul ist. 
It 's a reci pe for disaster, but direct 
democracy IS till democracy. 
Whi le it is useful to cnti ize the

A.S. to approve a resolution con-
demning another o rganizatio n 's 
viewpoint, or better yet, just using 
racial slur . 

In a more overused example, 
take any student o rganizati o n , 
movement, belief or ideology and 
place it next to the Koaln and there 
will a great deal of offense taken. 

Much more disrurbing is not 
whether students are offended, but 
rather how they and the universi ty 
respond to offensive sinl3ti ons. In 
regards to these siruati ons, universi-
ties are in an awkward situa tion . 
They must choose between leavi ng 
srudents to fend for themsel ves in 
many complicated social interac-
tions, (many of which they have 
never experienced) or relyi ng on 111 
Inco parentis and subsequently taking 
care of the students as though they 
are not ready for the rea l world . 
Universities have thus fa r opted 
toward the latter, offering a haven 
from ten e encounters. In som e 
cases, schools have blatantly tried to 
squash offensive events simpl y 
because someone was offended. 

In offering students the right to 
not be offended (or at least by 
directing them toward the mindset 
that they deserve this r ight) schools 
are veering tOO far into protecting 
students from the real world . 
Things like the Principles of the 
Community, cracking down o n 
hate speech and squelching other 
pos ible sources of offense may 
scem like a good idea to help Stu -
dents learn in the best possible 
environnlent, but it actually does 
srudents a disservice. It leads them 
to be offended by everything that 
disagrees with their way of life, 
which is the anti thesis of diversity. 

Beyond that, this strategy cre-

ates a fantasy world that leaves stu-
dents unprepared when faced with 
real o ffen ive situations, and no 
admini stration to offer a helping 
hand. Worst of all , the more stu-
dents realize they can crush oppos-
ing viewpoi nts, m erely by acting 
offended, the more smdents will be 
flooding into A.S. Counci l meet-
ings, trying to label their oppo-
nents as purveyors of hate speech, 
which is already a despicably 
abused phrase. 

And in the end, the sad but unde-
niable truth that we must realize is 
that it is difficult to live on campus 
\vith 0 many diffe rent people. It is 
just as difficult for a Christian to 
hear that his or her religion is the 
sole source of the world's problems 
as it is for a Muslim student to be 
merciles Iy mocked by sati rical stu-
dent publications. 

H owever, these are the conse-
quences of living "in such a diverse 
etting and it will be difficult. Bur 

that is the power of freedom and 
dive rsity for good o r for ill . If stu-
dents hate it that much, then we 
might as well admit that freedom is 
a bad th ing and start discrimina ting 
against one side of all ideological 
spectrums - something many uni-
versities already do. 

So the goal of th is year should 
be to resist bei ng offended by 
everything and just admit that 
many people don 't agree with each 
other, but ultimately realize tha t it 's 
just diversity at work. It's nothing 
to be upset about. Now, go out 
there and accomplish that goal, you

Aff. action case decided 
Supreme Court rules that race can be 

factor in admi sian , but no awarding points 
By NEIL SPEARS 
Senior Staff Writer 

The .S. Supreme Court ruled 
on June 23 that race can be used as 
a factor in college admissions in a 
pair of landmark decision clarify-
ing affirmative action, but that the 
awarding of points to underrepre-
sented minorities in the admis-
sion proce s is unconstitutional. 
Becau e the use of ra e in adrnis-
sion is already banned at public 
universities in California, the deci-
ions are not expected to affect 

UC admis ions processc . 
The high court heard two ep-

3r3te but parallel cases involving 
racial preferences u ed by the 
University of 'lichigan for admi -
sions. 

The COUrt, by a 5 -4 vote, 
approved the University of 
Michigan Law chool's affirmative 
action program. However, the 
Court struck down the University's 
undergraduate admi sions policy 
of awarding 20 extra points on the 
admissions ranking scale for 
blacks, Latinos and American 
[ndians with a vote of 6-3 . 

Petitioners in the law school 
case, Grutttr v. Bollinge1', argued 
that the university's admissions 
process illegally di criminated 
against Barbara Gruner, a white 
applicant who was turned away 
from the law school. Mer investi-
gating, Gruner determined that 
underrepresented minorities with 
lower admissions scores than her 
own were admined. 

Both cases hinged upon the 
Coun's 1978 decision in R~gmts of 
rh~ Univn-Jiry of CalifornIa v. BaH~, 
which deemed racial quota systems 
unconstitutional, but ruled that the 
"narrowly tajlored" consideration 
of race in admissions serves a 
bonafide state interest. 

"We find that the law school's 
admissions program bears the 
hallmark of a narrowly tailored 
plan," wrote Justice Sandra Day 

'Connor, who cast the deciding 
vote and authored the opinion of 
the Court in GruNer. "We expect 
that 25 years from now, the use of 
racial preferences will no longer 

be neces ary to further the interest 
approved today." 

In the case involving the uni-
versity's undergraduate admis ions 
program, G"atz v. Bol/inger, Chief 
Justice WIlliam Rehnqui t wrote 
that " the university's policy is not 
narrowly tailored to achieve the 
interest in educational diversity 
that respondent claim justrfies 
their program." 

The deci ion bring an end to 
court banles that have lasted 
almost six year. 

"The Court has provided two 
important signals," aid University 

" We expect that 25 years 
from now, the use of 

racial preference will no 
longer be necessary ... " 
- Sandra Day O'Connor, U.s. 

Supreme Court Justice 

of Michigan President Mary Sue 
Coleman. "The first is a green 
light to pursue diver ity in the col-
lege classroom. The econd i a 
road map to get us there." 

o immediate impact will be 
felt in California, where, in 1996, 
vO[ers approved Proposition .209, 
barring race to be a factor of 
admission to any public university 
in the sta te. 

"Because California's voters 
banned the use of affirmative 
action in admissions to the state's 
public universities in 1996, the 
recent Supreme Court decisions 
regarding the Unjversity of 
Michigan'S cases will not affect the 
Uillversity of California's admis-
sions policies," said Lavonne 
Luqws, director of outreach and 
admissions communications at the 
UC Office of the President in a 
July 23 message. 

Other reaction to the Court's 
decisions has been firm. 

"The court's action to uphold 
the principles of affirmative action 

sends an important message that 
diversity can be one of many com-
pelling considerations in admit-
ting students to our nation's most 
selective universities," UC 
Pre ident Richard C. tkinson 
said in a statement relea ed hort-
ly after the decision were 
announced. "The University of 
California will continue to comply 
with Proposition 209, and we will 
continue to work through other 
legal means to achieve excel lence 
and diver ity on our campuses." 

[mmediatcly following the 
enactment of Propo ition 209 in 
fall 1998, acceptance rates of 
undcrrepresented minorities at 
the University of California fell 
significantly. 

Hanan Eisenman, media coor-
dina tor for admissions a t the 
UCOP, says that since the enact-
ment of Proposition 209, the UC 
system has expanded outreach and 
refined the admissions process. 

"On the one hand, since the ini-
tial dip after Proposition 209 took 
effect, underrepresented minority 
enrollment has risen steadily at all 
campuses," Eisenman said. "On 
the other hand, our mo t selective 
campuses are still far below where 
they were in terms of minority rep-
resentation. " 

ince fall 2002, the Uruver ity 
of California ha used an admis-
sion proce s called comprehen-
sive review that anempts to take 
into account the full record of 
each applicant. While nO[ 
designed as a replacement for 
affirmative action, the new system 
has increa ed minority admittance 
at most UC campuses since the 
beginning of race-blind admis-
sions, most notably at UCSO. 

In fall 1998, the first year of 
race-blind admissions, underrep-
resented minorities made up 9.9 
percent of freshman admission 
offers for UCSD. For fall 2003, 
15 .2 percent of admission offers 
were extended to underrepresent-
ed minori ties. 

Systemwide, admi ion offers 
to minorities have increa ed I per-
cent since the last year of race-
conscious admissions.

New grading criteria will be

develop the new grading critena 
over the summer. 

Cox felt that giving grades 
would not pose any brg problems. 

"I don't think that administer-
ing grade, given years of experi-
ence in grades, is going to be that 
much of a problem," ox said. 

CEP did not specify how the 
letter grades will be implemented. 

"The goal is to keep grading 
from dominating tl1e cene. What 
we don't want to do is set grades 
that are wildly unrea onable," 
Jordan said. 

" 

The \Varren faculty has full

is also compelling." 

In the past, almost all Warren 
writing students received a "pass." 
Few ever gOt a "no pass," according 
to Jordan. 

"Instead of having students get a 
'no pass: we encourage them to 
drop the course. You can retake the 
course anyways, and do it again," 
Jordan said. 

The small number of students 
in each writing class provides 
opportunity for close interaction 
between the TA and students. 

"For students who will not pass, 
we tell them early to come back 
next [quarter] with a new drawing 
board, a fresh st3rr. But we don't 
know how we'd do that witl1 the

for a letter grade. 

More plans regarding U SO' 
writing programs include forming a 
group of faculty members to read a 
selection of randomly selected snr-
dent work in each of the six writing 
programs. EP ha decided that 
there should be uch a commi ttee

Moshe afdie, who is celebrated 
for his worldwide projects includ-
ing those at Harvard University, 
Montreal, Quebec, and Jerusalem. 
His firm teamed with daughter 
Taal Safdie of Safdie Rabines 
Architects in San Diego to buiJd 
the college. 

Taal afdie said that while cre-
ative control was given to the 
architect and his firm, the universi-
ty had already taken steps to ensure 
the desired quality of the college. 

he asserted that while the archi-
tect designed the college, the actu-

university. 

Both UCSD and the firm, 
however, aimed to "create a sense

buJldJOgs around pedestrian

Wulbert's appointment has 
been met with strong upport 
from the faculty and administra-
tion. 

"Wulbert's pa t ervicc as 
interim provost of Thurgood 
Marshall College and his out-
standing commionent to teaching 
and to the UC 0 undergraduate 
college system make him excep-
tionally well sui ted to provide 
leadership in the continued excel-
lence of Revelle College," said 
Marsha A. Chandler, senior vice 
chancellor of academic affairs and 
UCSD's interim chancellor 
beginning Oct. 2. 

ancy Groves, dean of acade-
mic advising at Revelle and a 
member of the provost search 
committee, echoed the senti-
ment. 

"Wulbert is truly imere ted in 
und ergraduates. lIe literally 
exudes enthusiasm abollt them," 
Groves said . 

\Vulbert follows F. Thomas 
l3o nd, wh retired as provost in 
june, foll owing twO deca des in

"Tom Bo nd was incredibl y 
dedicated to snldents," \Vulben

istration, you find tl,at there arc a 
thousand little things to do all

all day running around doing 
tl,ings and scurrying back and 
forth , and when you get hOllle, 
you ca n't necessarily think uf 
anything that you've actually 
done." 

In addition to overseeing the 
administration of the college as a 
whole, provosts act to protect 
and enhance the c3mpuswide 
quality of undergraduate educa-
tion . 

Wulbert remarked that "one 
of the thing that's exciting about 
taking this Job is the Idea lhat

Chandler: Chancellor 
anticipates challenge 
cominlled from page I 

ning t. 2. Chandl e r was con -
firmed by the U Regen ts at 
their Sept. 17 meeti ng. 

Chandler will serve as cha n-
cellor for a period not to exceed 
one year, during which a search 
for a new chancellor will be co n-
ducted. 

"It is an honor to assume the 
role of acting chancellor at a 
time of major challenges and 
also substantial opportunities," 

handler said following her 
appointment. "The idea of being 
a ked to guide one of the top 
universities in the nation is a ter-
rific feeling." 

The UC' top adminisu'ators 
expressed support for Chandler's 
appoi ntment. 

"Marsha handler is an out-
tanding cholar and an excep-

tional administrator," stated UC 
President Richard C. Atkinson, 
who is retiring in October after 
eight years as president. 
"President-designate Dynes and I 
greatly appreciate Dr. Chandler' 
willingness to take on this impor-
tant resp n ibility. We know she 
will do an excellent job." 

Substantial state budget cutS 
coupled with record enrollment 
levels will provid e extra chal -
lenge for Chandler. 

"For our ca mpus and the 
)' tem, this is an extraordinarily 

challenging period that will 
demand thoughtful and wise 
decisions by ou r leadershl p 
team," D ynes said . "Marsha is a 
dynamic leader who has the 
vision, experience and judgment 
to guide the campus and ensure 
that D maintain s its 
remarkablc momentum." 

According to ' C handl er, 
ensuring that the quality of pro -
grams and recruitmeet o£.ullder-
graduates, graduateS, faculty anC:1 
staff "i not Impeded by what 
will be serious belt 'ghtening" 
is key to her strate f weather-
ing tough economic times. 

In the next few weeks, a 
search co mmittee chaired by 
Dyne will be convened to 
search thc nation for pro pective 
chancellor. The panel will 
include regents, faculty, s tu -
dent, alumni, foundation and 
staff representatives. 

The sea rch committec i 
expected to announce the top 
candidate in carly spring 2004. 

Wht:n asked If she would be 
seeking the permanent chancel -
lor hip, handler said, "We'll 
cc what happens as the proce 

unfolds . " 

Chandler sees the recent 
expan ion of programs at UCSD 
as an o pportunity for even m ore 
growth . 

"I think one of thc bigge~t 
things that will shape our future 
will be the conti nuing expansion 
of al-( I'1")2, our science and 
technology institute that 's offer-
ing lots of opportunities in the 
sciences and enginecring and 
indeed even across into the 
humanities and social sciences," 
Cha ndler said . 

crving as UCSD's chief aC3-
demic officer for the past seven 
years, Chandler has been illle-
gTally involved in education 
across the entire campus. 

However, shc sa id that onc's 
education at the univcr ity i not 
just what happens in the c lass-
room. 

"I don't want to sou nd like 
['m the agent for s tudent organi-
zations, but 1 think it 's true that 
one really needs [0 get involved," 

handler said. " I also think It 
helps to organi ze your timc." 

handler is looking forward 
to the opportunities to interact 
with staff, faculty, students and 
the exterJul comm uni ty that her 
new POSt provides. 

A wcIl-published scholar of 
public policy and organizational 
behavi r, Chandler received her 
bachelo r of arts Jegree from the 
College of the City of New York 
and her doctorate frolll the 

niver ity of North Carolina.

that will benefit undergraduates." 

Wulbert balanccs his work with 
cycling. Most days, the six-time 
amateur national champion com-
mutes 25 miles to UCSD on his 
bike. 

" I find [cycling) to be an excit-
ing sport," said the 6 1-yea r-old 
Wulbert. "Time goes fast, it has a 
lot of variety in it, and I rather like 
that." 

Wulbert won the time-tria l and 
placed econd in the road race at a 
national competition in Bakersfield 
inJuly 2003. He also took home the 
best all-around rider award, beating 
cyclists in every age category. 

While stressing the importance 
of academic in undergraduate' 
lives, Wulbert noted that college 
providcs a time of growth outside 
of the cia sroom as well. 

"There are students here who 
are JUSt incredibly interesting," 
Wulbert said. "If you can find a few 
good friends that are interesting 
and make the world bigger for you, 
that often you keep for life and 
becomes a marvelous thing." 

Wulbert attended Knox 
College, where he received his 
bachelor of science degree, and 
the University of Texas, Austin, 
where he was awarded his doctor-
ate. Before comi ng to UCSO in 
1973, Wulberr sllldied at the 
Teddington Laboratories in 
England and the University of 
Lund in Sweden. 

H e was an assi tant professor at 
the University of Washington from 
1967 to 1973 .

authored approximately 50 works 
in functional analysis and approxi-

Comm. college transfers rise 
Due to budget problems, 1,600 tran fers tumedway 

By MEAGHAN FIELD 
Staff Writer 

Following a four-year trend, 
community collegc transfers to 
UC campuses increa cd again this 
yea r, rising 7.6 percent from last 
year. The University of CalifornIa 
adm.itted 14,665 tran fer students 
this yea r, 1,500 of which UCSD 
admitted. This number rcneCls 
the fact that eight out of every 10 
transfer applicants were admitted 
to the campu es. 1,600 winter 
quarter applicants, however, were 
not considered due to university 
budget cuts. 

This decision affected both 
community college students and 
recent high chool graduates. 
UCSD was unaffectcd as it only 
accepted students with guaranteed 
transfers for winter quarter. 

Despite the budget CtltS, th e 
increase of transfer applications 
are seen as proof of a promising 
future for transfer tudents by UC 
officials who hope to continue this 
trend and meet transfer increase 
goals through both old efforts and 
new ones, such as the Dual 
Admissions Program which will 
begin in fall 200·t 

"We have a commitment to 
California communi ty collegc 
tran fer s tudents," aid Mae 
Brown, assistant vice chancellor 
for admi sions and enrollmcnt 
ervices at UCSD. 

"\ Ve have found that transfer 
students do \\'ell academically, and 
graduate with comparable gradua-
tion rates. They bring diverse 
backgrounds and expericnces to 
the classrooms. We are very 
pleased with our efforts in thi

area and we hope they will contin-

She attributes this growing 
trend to the "memorandum of 
understanding," a partnership 
agreement made between UC 
President Richard C. Atkinson 
and the chancellor of the 
California community colleges, 
which, according to her, "encour-
aged an increa e in the number of 
transfer students," and to the ub-
sequent partnership agreement 
which "cncouraged each campus 
to develop comprehensive transfer 
programs." 

The memorandum of under-
standing was established in 1997 
by Atkinson and the college as J 

way to begin the growth . The 
partnership agreement wa later 
set between the UC Bo,lrd of 
Regents and Gov. Gray Davis' 
administration and includes spe-
cific goals and programs [0

cation . These goals include pro·

The White Stripes 
RIMAe, 7:30 pm 

D etroit's WHITE STRIPES are a 
striking stage pre ence, eire sed in 
minimalist red and white outfits as 
they pound out their rudimentary, 
energetic rock. T heir self- titl ed 
debut CD garnered immediate 
praise, mixing astute cover versions 
of blue man RobertJohnson and 
Bob Dylan's with some devastating 
ori ginals. By the time of the fol-
lowing year's D e Stij l, named after 
the Dutch abstract art movement 
led by Gerrit Rietveld, the media 
buzz surroundin g the White Stripes had reached new heights. 
Of particular nOte was the duo 's incredible reception in the 
UK, where their music was lauded and their importance om-
pared to that of H endrix and the Sex Pistols. T he dispute here 
is that both these act were o riginators, whereas the Wh ites 
are very good interpreters. T here are just toO many shades of 
early Kinks, the Doors, Television and late 60s American 
garage/punk bands to warran t a major p lace in twenty- firs t 
century rock history.

Dolores Huerta 
appointed UC regent 

United Farm Workers activist 
chosen by Davis for 6,month term 

By CLAYTON WORFOLK 
Senior Staff Writer 

T he state Senate confirmed 
overn or Gray Davis' appoint-

ment of farmworker activist 
Dolores Huerta to the UC Boa rd 
of Regents on Cpt. I I. 

I {uerta, who co-founded what i 
now the Uni ted Farm \Vorkers 
union wi th the late Cesar Chavez in 
1962, will erve the remaining six 
months o f Regent Norman j. 
Pattiz's term on the board. 

Pattiz, chairman of nationwide 
radio network Westwood ne and 
a longtime Davis contributor, was 
confirmed to a new l2-year term 
on the same day. 

Davis nominated Huerta a day 
after Senate Rules Committee 
member - loria Romero (D- Los 
Angeles) refused to vote to confirm 
Pattiz's appoinonent, citing a lack 
of diversity on the boa rd. 

Romero said she recommended 
Huerta for nomination, although 
Davis spokespersons deny that 
Romero 's demands were cau e for 
Huerta's appointment. 

Huerta, 73, is a former school 
teacher and current secretary-trea-
surer of the UFW. 

In a conference call wi th 
reporter , Huerta rebuked cri ticism 
that her appoinoneot was politica l-
ly motivated and discussed her 
goal as a regent. 

"Governors do put people that 
they like on the board," Huerta 
aid. "I don't think (the appoint-

ment] was politically motivated." 
Huerta also noted that her nom-

ination was initiated by Romero, 
not Davis. 

Huerta said that diversity and 
social justice in the UC system are 
among her primary concerns. 

"Part of academic excellence is 
integration, nOt just ethnic but eco-
nomic," Huena said . "[This) adds 
to the excellence of an education ." 

Huerta aid he expected con-

fro ntations wi th fellow regent 
Ward Connerly on such issues, 
especia lly that of Proposition 54, 
which Connerly pushed Onto the 
now-posrponed Oct. 7 ba ll ot. 

Proposition 54, also known as 
the lass ifi cation of Race, 
Ethnicity and N ational Origin ini-
tia ri ve, would amend the state con-
stitution to prohi bit state and local 
government from collecting data 
on race or ethnicity. 

"[Connerly is] out of step with 
most of the people on the board," 

H uerta said. "I 
really applaud 
the regents 
decision to 
oppose Prop. 
54." 

Huerta also 
expressed con-
ce rn over the 
U n ive r si t y'S 

Dolores Huerta recent decision 
Farmworker not to eval ua te 
activist and the Winter 2004 

newest UC regent applications of 
1,600 California 
communi ty col-

lege students due the budget cut-
backs. 

"[Communi ty colleges are] 
where most of the kids from work-
ing fam ilies and people of color 
go," Huerta said . 

According to Huerta, 
Ca lifornian studen ts shou ld be 
given priori ty before out-of-sta te 
studencs. 

Huerta acknowl edged her 
term's brevity, but was optimistic 
about its potentia.!. 

"I'm sure I'll be able to learn a 
lot and hopefully I'll be reappoint-
ed," Huerta said. 

In her first days on the board, 
Huerta has lobbied against further 
delaying the opening of UC 
Merced in response to projected 
funding cuts, ca ll ing the Central 
Valley campus "payback" for the 
children of fa rm laborers. 

Transfers: Trend shows 
numbers ris ing for fifth year 

COJ1(lnued {rom paRe A ' 5 
T hurgood ,\!arshall transfer stu-
dent, these programs are not enti re-
Iyeffective. 

" I had to do everything by 
myself," he said. "The counsel rs a t 
my college were not helpful at all ." 

Iso ava ilable to tudCnlS who 
do not have the re~ource of a good 
counselor are \\feb sites such as 
www.assisr.org, which provi<1 es 
informati on about how certain 
community college credits may he 
applied to UC campuses. There are 
also outreach programs run 
through individual UC campu C~, 
which work to help encourage com-
muni ty college tuden~ to transfer 
and hel p them define their goals. 

"It IS the aggres i\'e work of 
people at local UC campu es to lar-
get students at communi ty colleges 
which is responsibl e fo r the rismg 
numbers," Brown said. 

T he attraction for community 
coll ege tud nlS to tr,lJ1sfer to a ' 
campu vary, but among them i the 
pro pec tivc of continu ing their 
education at well-known chool 
with g od repmations. 

"The Cs have a good repma-
tion," postolides said. "r couldn 't 
get Il1tO college after high school 
because I made ome wrong choic-
es, so I went to [communi ty col-
lege]. l wanted to stay in California 
and I knew the UC were all good 
chool ."

Volleyball: Tritons are 4;0 in CCAA play 
conrinued from page k8 

Upon their return home, the 
Tri tons opened the eM sched-
ule with home matche against 
CSU Stani laus, CSU Bakersfield, 
CSU Dominguez Hill, and No. 25 
C U Los Angeles. U SD dropped 
only one game during the four-
match stretch, and established their 
perfect 4-0 record in the confer-
ence. 

lligh expectations and goals are 
the norm within the UC D hud· 
die. 

" umber one on a I t of goal 
sheets was winning a national 
championship, but then what was 
more important was the process we 
would try to take to get there, and 
that meant training hard," 
McFarland said . 

The Tritons trained hard over 
the summer, and McFarland 
ca lled his team's fitness level the 
best he'd seen while coachi ng at 
UCSD. Combined with the 
amount of talent the Tritons have 
brought back, the future looks 
bright. 

etter Teresa Ohta, middle 
blockers Katie Hogan and Kendra 
Canape, and outside hitters 
Bonnie \\Til son and Stacy 
Dunsmore lead a talented class of 
juniors who return from la st 
year's team.

and her all - around play is high -
lighted by a team-leadi ng 4.07 
digs per game this year. The addi-
tion of transfer Lindsay Crandell 
will give UCSD yet another dan · 
gerous option from the outside. 
The tempos of the Triton's three 
big hitters could pose problems 
for opposing blockers. 

UCSD's effort in the blocking 
department thi season will be led 
by middles Hogan and Canape. 
[ logan's solid play and consistency 
along with Canape's high -flying 
energy make for an effective com-
bination . The Tritons' newfound 

" Once we got back and got that ranking, 1 think it

women's volleyball head coach 

ability to take over a game 
through the block, as the squad 
did during the CSULA match , 
s hould serve as a va luable weapon 
in their title quest. 

Adding to the mix will be the 
senior duo of Lauren Mills and 
Ashley Peter on, who will hare the 
responsibi lities at the opposite 
position . Peterson's size and block-
ing ability along with Mills' quick-
ness and athleticism give 

McFarland a strong front rowl 
back row platoon. 

The role of libero - a back-
row defensive specialist who nei· 
ther serve nor attacks and has 
unlimited substitutions - will be 
held primarily by soph omore 
Laura Watkins, although Ohta 's 
backup at setter, seni or Denell e 
Smalley, might al so sec time at lhe 
po ition. 

Injuri es and s ic kness have 
diminished the Tritons' depth , 
especially at middle blocker, but 
UCSD retains a batch of talented 
players capable of filling in at each 
posi tion . 

For the 1rilOns to hold onto the 
top spot in the rankings all the way 
through the national championship 
game in December, they know that 
they will have to continue to match 
their high level of play. 

U[The key i I consistent)'. ot 
playing like we're on a roller coas t-
er, not going up and down, ju t 
playing consistent all the way 
through," said Ohta, one of the 
team captains. 

That consistency will be tested 
a the Tritons embark on a fivc -
game road trip on Sept. 26 through 
Oct. 4, in which they will 
encounter defending conference 
champion and third·ranked C U 
San Bernardino, UCSD's biggest 
volleyball rival. 

Though predictions at thi 
point in the season are highly 
uncertain, should the Tritons con· 
tinue their early tear and play con· 
sistently this year, the two words at 
the top of the UC D goal sheets 
might apply very nicely: national 
champions.

the lead for good. 
After a 4-0 start, U D trav-

eled to Los Angele to take on the 
o. 2 ranked University of outh 

Caroli na Trojans. The Tritons 
were confident heading into USC 
and had beaten the Trojan in the 
past. 

In the first half, U SD 
howed that this team also had 

the potential win as they held the 
Trojans to a 4-1 score in the sec-
ond period. Hopkins put UCSD 
on the board wi th 3 :26 remaining 
in the first period , and Bor 0 fol-
lowed him at the I :46 mark. 
Hopkins added another goal to 
increase hi s total to 16 on the 
season in just five games. 
Jendru ina cored the next goal 
for the Triton . 

However, the Tritons cou ld 
not get any more goals the rest of 
the match and USC tied the score 
at 4-4 at the hal f, and then scored 
five more goal in the second half 
to win 9-4. 

''In the past, we were able to 
score goals in the econd half; thi 
year we did not score a single goal 
at US in the econd hal f. We 
wenrO-13," H arper aid. 

Unfortunately for the Tritons, 
they had no time to worry about 
their loss, since they faced another 

top- ranked opponent in U 
Berkeley, wh ich is ranked third, 
and last year's NCAA national 
runners up. UCSD put up a good 
fight at Canyonview Pool , but was 
beat by the Golden Bears, 11 -8. 

For the second straight game, 
the Tritons were unable to hold 
onto to a first-half lead . UCS D 
had an 8-7 lead 28 seconds into 
the fourth period . Cal stepped up 
and scored four unanswered 
goals to claim the victory. Cal 
was 5- 11 on man-up situations, 
while UCSD wa only 4 - 1 J. AlI-
American Attila Banhidy led 
Cal' attack, netti ng four goals 
while UCSD's Ustaszewski con-
tributed three goals. This los 
dropped UCS D to 4-2 on the 
season and improved Cal's record 
to 2-0. 

The Tritons then traveled to 
Irvine, alif. on ep. 20 and 21 to 
partici pate in the outhern 
California Men's Water Polo 
Tournament that incl ud ed the 
cou ntry's tOP four teams. 

UCSD first faced off against 
no. II UC Santa Barbara and 
edged the auchos 6-5, improv-
ing to 5 -2 in the season . The 
Triton attacked right away, scor-
ing five goa ls in the first half. 
Borso and Ustaszweski each 
sco red a pair and Ellis tallied one 

to give U D a 5-3 advantage. 
The Tritons denied a omeback 
by the Gauchos in the second 
half with Clark Petersen scoring 
the sixth goa l for the Tritons in 
the third period, to secure the 
victory. 

UCSD's next oppo nenr wa 
top ranked Stanford and the 
Cardinal proved to be too much 
for the Tritons, beating them 14-
8. UCSD battl ed Stanford in the 
first half, scoring four in the first 
period and adding one lIlore in the 
second to kn t it'Jj) at 5-5 at half-
time. H owever, the ardi nal took 
control in the econd half, pepper-
ing the Tritons with nine goals 
and allowing only three past their 
goa lie C had Taylor. 

UCSD's IIopkins ta ll ied 3 
pai r of goa ls while Cooper, 
Peterson, Borso, staszewski, 
Eicholz and Ellis each con-
tributed one goal in the losing 
effort. Sta nford 's Tony Azevedo 
sco red four goals and Mike 
D er e scored three to lead the 

ardinal attac k. T his loss 
dropped UC D to 5-3 and 

tanford to 2-0 for the season . 
UC D followed their 10 with 

twO wins on Sep. 2 1 again t

time of 26:27,9. Seniors Richey 
Hansen (36th, 26:46.3), Eric 
Nilsen (37th, 26:48.1) and John 
Burke (53rd, 27:34.2) were also 
important to the team's suc.::ess. 

On the women's side, standout 
Firouz led the way for the Tritons' 
fifth-place finish, corning in 14th, 
covering the 5,ooO-meter course in 
19 minutes, 35 .4 seconds. Arizona 
scored 45 points to win the team 
event on the women's side as well, 
with Rachael Cuellar of New 
Mexico State racing 18:39.2 to take 
top individual honors. 

"Firouz is a fron t runner and 
she is very impressive and quite 
marure in her acceptance of colle-
giate competition," Van Arsdale 
said. 

Division I schools Southern 
Utah (60), Cal State Northridge 
(85) and UC Irvine (86) all beat out 
UCSD, but the Tritons, with an 
ample 126 points, topped CCAA 
o pponents Cal Poly Pomona and 
Sonoma State, as well as finishing 
ahead of several Division I schools, 
such as UNLV; New Mexico State 
and Loyola Marymount. 

Rounding out the top finishers 
for the Triton women were junior 
Lindsay Stalker (22nd, 19:49,8), 
sophomore Michelle DiMeo (26th, 
20:00.0) and seniors Amanda 
Felder (30th, 20:10.8) and Katie 
Bunker (39th, 20:31.2), all of 
whom also scored points for the 
Tritons . 

Senior Kathy Read (40th, 
20:32 .9), sophomores ina Miller 
(43rd, 20:40. 1) and Lindsey Young 
(50th , 20:54.4), senior Julie Pope 
(51st, 20:56.0), and sophomores 
Kate Branson (54th, 21 :03.4) and 
Meghan Bellotti (62nd, 21 :18.8) 
composed the balance of the 
UCSD racers entered in the 
event. A total of 107 women com-
peted . 

The UCSD cross country 
squads competed the following 

atu rday, ept. 13, at the an 

Diego State Invitational. The third 
major meet of the season saw the 
UCSD men finish sixth among 
eight teams, while the Triton 
women placed ninth out of 14 at 
the 59th Annual Aztec Cross 
Country Invitational at Balboa 
Park. 

The diz.zying heat, training and 
competition had an impact on both 
teams, but the team still exhibited 
great teamwork. 

"The women up front compet-
ed well, but the guys ran tired and 
it was very hot," Van Arsdale said. 

Northern Arizona University 

" The team is to be serious 
with academic and athlet, 
ics and we are definitely 
ahead of schedule with

won both of the Invitational 
Division team events and provid-
ed the individual winners in both 
the men's and women's races. 
Travis Laird of the fifth-ranked 
men's team ran 25 :13 over 8,000 
meters while Johanna Nilsson of 
the 10th-ranked women's team 
raced 5000 meters in 17 :58 to win 
their respective races . The 
Lumberjacks edged UCLA in 
both team events . 

Powerful performances by 
Triton men permeated the day. 
For the Triton men, ranked 12th 
in Division II , Eap, a transfer out 
of City College of San Francisco, 
ran 26: 14 to secure a 10th-place 
finish. 

Morri on came in 28 th with a 
time of 27:04 while sophomore 

Carl Lostrom (45th, 27 :42), fresh-
man Steve Vargas (50th, 28:03), 
senior Henry L'esperance (55th, 
28: 12) and sophomore Kevin Ray 
(78th, 29:23) rounded out a six-
man Triton contingent which pro-
duced 157 points. A total of 89 
runners participated . 

T he Triton women, rated 16th 
nationally in Division II, accrued 
236 points to overwhelm 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association rivals Cal State 
Dominguez Hills, Cal State L.A. 
and Cal State San Bernardino. 

Stalker was the lead performer 
with a 25th-place effort in 19:24. 
Finishing 46th and 50th, respec-
tively, were Lindsey Young, who 
ran 19:57 and fellow sophomore 
Bailey Kennedy running an even 
20:00. Senior Lillian Gardiner 
(62nd, 20: 15), sophomore Erin 
O'Donnell (64th, 20: 16), senior 
Julie Pope (67th, 20: 19) and fresh-
man Brenda Stevens (73rd, 20:42) 
comprised the rest of the tOP seven 
for .UCSD. 

Runners Young and Kennedy 
were singled out by Van Arsdale for 
their particularly solid improve-
ment so far this season. 

"Young and Kennedy made 
phenomenal improvement; Young 
ran a mi nute faster than last year 
and Kennedy also made an incred-
ible jump in her time," Van Arsdale 
said. 

The remainder of the Tritons 
among the 125 total competitor 
included ophomores Meghan 
Bellotti (77th, 20:49) and Mimi 
Hodgins (89th, 2 1: 13), junior 
Jennifer Turk (90th, 21 : 14) and 
sophomore Kate Branson (92nd, 
21:3\ ). 

The UCSD cros counay teams 
will now head up north to the Bay 
Area to compete on Sept. 27 in th e 
Stanford Invitational , where th e 
tea m plan to run at least seven of

Water polo: Team not caught up in ranking 
continued from page A2B 

"Yes, this is the highest rank we 
have had to start the season," said 
coach Denny Harper. "But I don't 
care about where we start, I'm 
more interes ted in where we fin-
ish." 

Men's soccer: SFSU takes 
UCSD into double overtime 

Harper has an excellent resume 
in his 22 years at UCSD. He con-
sistently had teams ranked in the 
top 12 in the national poll, and has 
never led the Tritons to lower 
than a third-place finish in the 
conference. His teams have cap-
tured 12 titles and seven nmner-
up troph.ies, Although this could 
very well be one of Harper's best 
teams, he won't compare any of 
his teams . 

"We have very high aspira-
tions, as we always do," Harper 
said . "I don't get into comparing 
any of my teams. I'll simply say we 
have some great talent on this 
team." 

This talented team starts two 
seniors and many juniors, includ -
ing last year's leading scorers 
Brandon Borso and Jonathan 
Hopkin . At goalie is sophomore 
Colin McElroy, who will be a key 
to the team' performance this 
year. 

"We start a young goalie. The 
play of Colin McElroy this season 
will have a lot to do with our suc-
cess," Harper said . 

McElroy's talent was evident at 
the season opener, the 2003 UC 

an Diego Triton Men's Water 
Polo Invitational at Canyonview 
Pool. The team went 4-0 and won 
the tournament. 

In the first day of the tourna-
ment, CSD won both irs games 
handily. In the fir t game, UC D 
cru hed Pomona-Pitzer 25-2. La t 
yea r's lea ding sco re r Hopkins 
sta rted this season off where he 
left o ff, scori ng fo ur goals. Addi ng 

Radlel A Garcia/GuartflOn 
A tall order: UCSD's Clark Petersen and his teammates endured a tough early 
season schedule, facing top ranked teams like Cal, USC and Stanford. 
to the rout were J endrusina, 
Bor 0, and senior co-captain 
Matthew Ustaszewski, who scored 
three goals apiece . The Tritons 
continued to nex their mu des 
against their next opponent, 

" I don't care about 
where we start, I'm more 

interested in where we 
finish," 

- Denny Harper, UCSD men's 
water polo head coach 

Redland , and rolled to a 16-3 vic-
tory to fini sh the day. Hopki ns was 
spectacular again with five goals, 
while juni or C lark Pe tersen 
scored four ti mes and J endrusi na 
had truee. 

UCSD wasted no ti me in the 

second day of the tournament and 
defeated the UC Irvine Anteaters 
10-8. UCSD led through the 
whole match and held on for th e 
victory. Once again, Hopkin wa 
the star with three goals. Borso 
and sophomore Chris Eichh olz 
added two apiece. 

In the fin als, UCSD struck 
quickly and led the match 4-2 at 
the half against UC Santa 
Barbara. The Gauchos never quit 
and tied the game at the end of the 
third period on a goal by fre hman 
Matt Dale. Another freshman, J oe 
Ferguson, helped push UC anta 
Barbara to the lead in the final 
period. However, UCSD's talent 
and experience took over, and it 
was all Tritons after that. The 
Tri tons scored four un answered 
goa ls in a 2-minute, 30 econd 
span. In this ga me, the heroes 
were Borso, who scored three 
goals, and senior Matt Elli ,who's 
breakaway goal gave the TritOns

"We were tora lly in it with the 

national champs. We're ready to 
beat (them)," Armstrong said. "If 
we caught them later in the season, 
it might have been a different out-
come." 

After the game at Rohnert Park, 
the Tritons traveled to play San 
Francisco State on Sept. 21. 

T he UCSD defense couldn 't 
keep the Gators' offense in check 
like it did against the eawolves, 
allowing three goals. However, the 
Tritons managed to keep up with 
SFS U, and UCSD won wi th just 45 
seconds left in the second overti me 
period. 

Trailing the GatOrs 2 -1 at the 
67 :07 mark, Triton so phomore 
mid fi elder Matthew Davey con-
verted on a penal ty kick. Then 
with ju t seven minutes left in the 
gam e, UCSD took the lead on a 
goal by sophomore G rant Nishio, 
but San Francisco Sta te gOt the 
equalizer in tl1e 86th minute: to 
send the ga me into overtime. 

After both teams fa il ed to score 
in the first udden death period, it 
looked as if the game might end in 
a tie, but junior Magnus Lu took a 
pass from sophomore defender 
Robert Stetina to give the Tri tons 
the win.

UCSD battles defending champs 
Men's soccer opens 2003 season 4,2 

By ANU KUMAR 
Associate Sports Editor 

After closing our the 2002 
season by wi nning five of its last 
seven games and advancing to 
the postseason for the first time, 
the Triton men 's soccer team 
opened this fall schedule with a 
4-2 record . 

UCSD came out and made a 
bold statement, winning the sea-
son opener 3 -0 a t Azusa Paci fi c 
on Sept. 3, and the Tritons fol-
lowed that up with a -- I victory 
at home agai nst CSU an 
Bernardino one week later. In 
those games, UCSD got help 
from orne unfamiliar sources on 
the team, including freshman 
midfielder Brett Maurer, who 
scored the fir t goal against APU 
in his first collegiate start, and 
junior defender Luke Russell, 
who notched a hat trick to 
record the first three goals of his 
collegiate career against CSU B. 

The Tritons were then 
involved in their first real battle 
of the season on Sept. 13, when 
they fell 2 -Ion the road to 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association foe Cal Poly 
Pomona. UCSD failed to capi -
talize on many scoring opportu-
nities against Pomona, which 
was outshot 14-8 and yielded 
seven corner kicks to the 
Tritons. 

In its next contest, UCSD 
faced another CCAA South 
Division opponent in Grand 
Canyon. The Sept. 16 game in 
Phoenix went into double over-
time, when Maurer put the game-

winner in the back of the net at 
the 5:45 mark in the second ud-
den-death period. 

"Maurer has ju t been playing 
first class soccer," UCSD Head 
coach Derek Armstrong aid of 
hi freshman playing early in the 
season. 

The following game featured 
a Triton match-up against the 
defending national champion 
L o. 25 Sonoma State on the 
road. Going into the match with 
a 3- 1 overall record, Armstrong 
thought that the game would tell 
him a lot about the team. 

"This is a big one," Armstrong 
said the day before the Sept. 19 
game. "Obviously it's going to be 
a test." 

At Rohnert Park, Calif., the 
Seawolves' defensive line put 
together a strong performance 
and shutout the Tritons, who suf-
fered a 2-0 defeat. 

SSU midfielder Chad Smith 
opened the scoring late in the first 
half with a header over UCSD's 
senior goalkeeper Jeremy 
Cookson. In the second half, the 
Tritons pushed up to put more 
pressure on the Sonoma State 
defenders, but the Sea wolves 
kicked away just about every 
UCSD attack. With the Tritons 
focusing on offen e to tty to tie 
the score, SSU sealed the victory 
with another goal in the 85th 
minute. 

In the game, UCSD didn't 
have many scoring opportunities, 
as the statistics show. The 25th-
ranked Seawolves in Division II 
men 's soccer recorded 14 shots, 
while UCSD managed just seven,

and in corner kicks, the Seawolves 
rook seven and the Tritons had 
none. SSU goalkeeper Matt 
Bernard made three saves to earn 
his third shutout in just seven 
games. 

"Overall , we played well," said 
UCSD assistant coach Ted 
Przybylek. "It was a tOugh loss, 
but it's still early in the season and 
we're nOt done yet." 

Although the TritOns couldn't 
put together very many scoring 
threats, the UCSD defense did 
keep the game in reaching dis-
tance and showed that the Tritons 
can battle with nationally ranked 
teams.

on Sept. 6. At the 59th Annual 
Aztec Cross Country Invitational 
at Balboa Park on Sept. 13, the 
men fini hed sixth among eight 
teams while the Triton women 
placed Ilin th out of 14. 
Debilitating heat and exhaustion 
sapped some off the Tn ron 
strength. 

The team has high expecta-
tions to run to the best of their 
abilities to enable steady progres . 

"The team is to be senou with 
academiCS and athletJcs and we 
are defillltely ahead of schedule 
with our running," head coach 
Ted Van Ar dale said. 

The fir t meet of the year, a 
grueling four-mile men's race, 
saw the Triton men in close-knit 
formation, takmg on the to p fin-
isher and PL U senIOr Ryan 
Burnett. Despite the fact that 
Burnett managed to finish first 
for his fourth consecutive year, 
nine consecutive Tritons fol-
lowed close on his heels, ensur-
ing a strong finish for the team. 
This teamwork enabled the 
Tritons to win by the identical 

~core from la~! yea r, 20-43 . 
Following Burnett's first 

place time of 22:03.3 were 
Triton seniors Julian 1 ahan 
(22:22.7) and Eri c ilsen 
(22:23.9), who came in econd 
and thi rd, respectively, with

"The men were very olid and 
ran In a clme pack," Van Ar dale 
said. 

Th triangular women' race 

saw Jasmine Marks of Point 
Loma Nazarene complete the 
2.5-mile course in 15:26.3 to lead 
all competitors. The second 
place position went to UCS D 
fre hman Tina Firouz, running 
15 :40.0. To conserve their 
strength, the Triton did not 
have every tOp female runner 
compete at the meet. 

"We re ted five of our tOP 10 
girls," Van Ar da le said. 

UCSD sophomore Bailey 
Kennedy crossed the line In fi fth 
place, clocking in at 16:05 .1, 
shadowing Crysta l Tarnl 
(15:48.9) and J e. ica Howard 
(15:56.0), who were third and 
fourth for the Sea Lions. Joy

Fall sports 
deserve 

more 
attention 

Cyn (ity 
Cynthia Chavez 

T hese days, college sports are Ii ttered wi th scandal and drama, even during the 
summer when school isn't in ses-
sion. For example, there was the 
tragic murder of Baylor Uni\"er ity 
basketball player Patrick Dennehy 
by teammate Carlton Dotson, 
according to police. Also, big news 
was 57-year-old ex-Univer ity of 
Alabama football coach Mike 
Price' penchant for buying booze 
for college IPrls and frequenting 
strip clubs. These incidents, ju t to 
name a few, lead me to believe that 
the meaning of college sports has 
been lost. All of this is enough to 
disillusion even a die-hard sports 
lover like myself. 

Fortunately, r am lucky enough 
to still go to a school where the a th-
letes play 10 play-the same reason 
many of u played Little League 
and Pop \\'arner football when we 
were 011 not-nosed kid . 

True, lJCSD is Dmsion [] while 
our fell ow L'C north of us are 
DiI'l5lon I jlowcrhous With athJetes 
that are hOlliehold names and cam-
pus heroes. But, if you look at the 
standmgs, you'll clearly see that all 
Triton athleoc teams 10 the five fall 
sports currently in season are domg 
incrediblv well. TIus is one of the 
best sta~ we've ever had. The 
women's volleyball team has earned 
a o. I ranking, OUT womens soccer 
team IS undefeated and ranked 
fourth. In addition, the mens water 
polo team earned its highest ranking 
ever at 0. 6. It's quite a feat consid-
ering the water polo men are up 
against giants like of tanford, Cal 
and USC, who, by the way, give Out 
scholar hi ps. 

Our teams have always strug-
gled to get fans' support, but now 
they've proven themselves worthy 
of our nme. Corning to UC D, 
most of our athletes probably knew 
that games at RIMAC, Canyon view 
and the baseball field don't even 
come close to filling the capacity. 
Bur they came anyway because of 
the grea t education CSD can gi ve 
- and to SImply play. 

With all the million dollar 
endor~ements and flashy pro ath-
letes trymg to grace the stiver 
screen, It 's qUlle refresrung to come 
across people that play for love 0 
the game. Our fall teams have cer-
tainly earned our upport and If you 
just come OUI and watch for a little 
while, you'll realize it's worth your 
time. And to the freshmen that have 
just moved m; get away from AI. 1. 
and ask one of yOUT roommates to 
amble over to a sporting event to ee 
how well our teams have done while 
we haven't been In school. 

Fans create an impact, and It' 
called home field advantage. J guar-
antee your pre en e Will make a 
dIfference. The teams Will be ~o 
stoked you're supporting them that 
tlley will play harder, just Itke how 
you swung the bat a little harder 
and ran a Itttle faster when your 
friend s and parents watched you in 
Little League.

ARTS & ENTERTAINMENT 

B oasLing a massive heavy-hitter lineup, adult-lhemed entertainment and drinks galore, Street Scene promised to be "the 
best musical event In California." Is MTV 
right? Is this In fact the best musical event in 
Cali fornia? 

Well .. . no. That would be Coachella, only 
because their emphasis Is on the "music" side. 
What Street Scene oITers Is an envlronm nt all 
Its own, full of parades, raves, drag queens, and 
yes, music . This year's lineup leaned heavily on 
the nostalgic side (rightfu lly so, sin e it's pri -
marily a 21 and over event), featuring some

Friday's show started late for thi reviewer 
(it is almost 4 hours from Los Angeles to San 
Di go) . The unfortunate who showed up late 
mis I'd out on seeing Love with Arthur Lee, 
truly one of the fine t. most overlooked bands 
of the '60s. The band 's massively InOuential 
style is known for 
laying a cool shade 
of psyched lia over

their album Forever

considered one of 
the greatest of ail

stages, respectively. The venerable Los Angeles 
Social Distortion punks made an example of what 
to do when playing a festival : don't rely too much 
on hilS, don't be afraid to speed things up, don 't 
be afraid to slow things down and play some of 
your best material. By doing all of the above, 
Social D showed the youngins how Its done and 
probably made a number of new fans (including 
me) . 

Being half-drunk Is the best way to see 
Ozomalii. The band's multlgenre , muiligen-
erational, bi -gender appea l had everyone 
around them danCing , even those 
who should probably avoid such 
activity. With about fifteen people 
onstage and numerous musical 
sty les cram med Into s hort pop 
songs, the band exuded boundless 
energy, effortlessly s liding from 
salsa to jazz to hip-hop within the 
same songs. It was a toss -up to pick 
a band to see with six stages going at 
the same lime. The best option : 

TJbola Girayc-Bium! Guarcfian 

The sweet but 
innocuou sound of 
the Goo Goo Dolls

On the nonmusical front , I caught part of a 
drag show, which sta rted out funny. Who does 
n 't like seeing an overweight man dressed as a 
woman lip syncing Beyonce's kick-ass "Crazy in 
Love"? But the jokes wore thin as one drag 
queen repeatedly sang about her " pu sy," mean-
ing his/ her cat , but actually meaning something 
else entirely. The pussy gets wet, cold, grumpy,

Theater classics and newcomers shine 
Fall theater features the very best in drama, comedy and musicals 

By JESSICA LONe; 
Senior Staff Writer 

If you are looki ng for something new to do this quarter, consider checking out some of the many theater pro-ductions around San Diego. T here are a range of pro-ductions from comedie to dramas to musicals: from 
classics to world premieres: from expensive to cheaper 
than the price of a movie: from Downtown, to on campus. 

o matler where our interests are. there i at leasl a pro· 
duction or two for you in town this fall. 

Running now through Oct. 4 at 6th @ Penn is "Boy 
Gets Girl " by Rebecca Gilman. Directed by Caprice 
Woosley, this pia is recommended for mature audiences 
only. This suspenseful production tells the story of a 
woman whose secure life is quickly destroyed by a di -
turbed admirer and shows how easy it is to lose what is 
va lued most In the urban Jungle. 

Playing now through Oct. 12 at the Old Globe 
Theatre in Balboa Park is Shakespeare 's comedy 
"Much Ado About Nothing ." This favorite deals with 
two sets of lovers , Beatri ce and Bened ick, who would 
rather be lonely than admit their fee ling for the 
other,:and ClaudiO and Hero , two young sweethearts 
who get mixed up in all the games. Set in the Italian 
countryside, this tal e is full of willy wordpla . passion-
ate poetry and happily-ever-afters. 

The world premiere of B aul ," wrrtten and 
directed by Ti na Landau, is currently being put on with 
the La Jolla Playhouse T his new take on the classic 
fairy tal tells of a oung girl 111 medieval limes who 
comes of age as hrr world falls intO the mod rn era and 
of a young man 111 the modern lime whose search for 
beauty leads him II1tO the past This producti on Is run-
ning now through Oct 19 at the Mandell Weiss Forum 
at UCSD campus 

' Ro ugh Crossi ng " by Tom Stoppard is a delightful 
adaptation of Ference Molnar's "Play at the Castle, " 
running now through OCl. 26 at the Old Globe 
Theatre. This charming play tells the story of a musi -
cal -comedy wrHlng team and their speech · impaired 
composer who must finish their latest piece on a four-

day trip across the Atlantic. T hey are not helped much 
by their leading lady and man, and the ever· impending 
question Is "Will the show go on?" 

"Bluel Orange" by Joe Pinhall won the 2001 Oliver 
Award for "Best New Pia "and is now showing at the Old 
Globe Theatre. The play tells the story of tlVO ps chia-
trfSlS - one oung, one old - who fight over Ih(' tl eat -
ment of the young man claiming to be the son of all exih'd 
African dictator This hilarious production l1ms Sept. 25

The encouraging and the discouraging of upcoming fall films 
Fall promises to deliver an array of goofy comedies, sappy chick flicks and terrifying horror movies 

By ANNE CONG·HUYEN 
Hiatus Editor 

October 3 
"Ca8a de 108 BabY8" 

School is back In session and there's excite, 
ment and stress everywhere, making this the 
best time to visit the mecca of American pop 
culture- the movie theater- and to sec the 
latest that Hollywood has to offer. This fall 
promises to offer everything from great 
drama, stlly comedies and exciting thrtllers , so 
take a sneak peak at what 's coming out and see 
what looks promising and what looks 
appalling. 

A fi rst-rate cast of actresses, Including 
Marcla Gay Harden, Massie Gyllenhaai. Daryl 
Hannah and Susan Lynch, join forces in this 
Indle about six American women In an 
unnamed Latin American city hoping to adopt 
babies. This film depicts the entire situation, 
from the teenage mothers , th nurses and even 
the unfortunate children who don 't get adopt-
ed. Director John Sayles ("Girlfight") takes a 
relevant Issue and turns it into a touching and 
human film . Be prepared to cry. 

September 26 
"Duplex" "School of Rock" If you 're tired of dramatic Oscar con-

tenders, then th is may very well be the movie 
for you . Jack Black plays a delusional musician 
kicked out of his band and is so desperate for 
money he poses as a substitute teacher where 
he ends up turning his students into bonafide 
rock stars. Sure, this is a Jack Black film , but 
don 't expect th is one to be a loser, like 
"Shallow Hal" or "Orange County." Black Is 
already gelting posi tive reviews. and Joan 
Cusack can only make th is film beller. 

Coorte5)' 
Lifesavers: Ben Stiller and Drew Barrymore get 
up-dose and personal with their ne ighbor. 

Drew Barrymore pairs up with the king of 
physical comedy, Ben Stiller, for this movie 
about a young and promising New York cou-
ple that buys a duplex thinking it 's their 
dream home. But - u~prise. surprise - they 
meet their little old neighbor who will 
Inevitably drive them Insane. Although not 
the most original of storylines, hopefully the 
Danny DeVito-helm d film wtll make up for 
It with original humor. Stiller and Barrymore 
will either ~ave you clutching your sides or 
desperately controll ing your gag refl ex.

"Intolerable Cruelty" 

George Clooney is at his charming peak in 
this romantic comedy about a Beverly Hills 
divorce lawyer who falls for his seductive new

the peaks of thei r attraction abilities and are 
accompanied by a distinguished cast Including 
Bmy Bob T hornton as a wealthy hick (we all 
knew he had it in him!) and Geoffrey Rush. 
Since it's a Coen Brothers' movie, expect morc

"Kill Bill: Volume I" 
Gratuitous violence and Uma Thurman. Yep, 

Quentin Tarantino is at it again. This time, 
Thurman plays a former assassin who wakes up 
from a four·yearcoma and swears revenge on her 
former boss and his gang. This film will undoubt· 
edly have Tarantino's trademark high-paced cin· 
ematography, action and music, so die· hard fans 
wfll not be disappointed. With assassins played by 
Lucy Liu, Darryl Hannah and Vivica A. Fox, men 
will be necking to theaters like San Diego State

Clint Eastwood returns to directing fea ture

they try to solve an Irrational mu rder and 
renect upon their histories of friendship , fami -

nation. Despite the exciting premise and gifted 
actress, "Veronica Guerin" appears to be anoth-

A soul-sucking summer: This year's summer movies take a turn for the worse

Associate Hiatus Editor 

hideously awful, you walked out of the theater 
wanting the $9 and two hours of your life 
back. 

Summer used to hold the promise of good popcorn, air-conditioned theater and a list of good movies to watch . This past 
summer. however. things took a turn for the 
worse. with week after week of new releases 
that were so terrible. it 's an amazement the 
scripts got in the door. Sure. there were some 
movies that were suppa ed to be cheesy and 
terrible (think nicks like "Terminator 3 ") . but 
then there were the ones that were so 

And .,here do you begin the list? You 
could always Lart wiLh "Gigll, - but rea lly, 
who hasn't already heard enough about that 
film? The next -worst film would have to be 
"From Justin to Kelly." The most important 
thing to know about this movie is that watch-
ing it will force you LO lose up to 400 brain 
cells per minute . Lowlights of the film includ-
ed two hours of painfully. painfully bad dia-
logue. horrjfic acting, and the crappiest songs 
since "Macarena ." Highlights? Absolutely 
none. There have been movies in the past that 
were so appalling they were actually good. 
This was not one of them. 

Perky drivel: Talented Luke Wilson and Reese 
Witherspoon couldn't save this travesty. 

quel to the Farrelly brother hit "Dumb and 
Dumber." Like "American Wedding," the 
film lacked thc return of the original stars. 
However, unlike "Wedding ." "Dumb and 
Dumberer" featured no one who wa involved 
with the original. Both of the lead actors a 
well as the director were new. Is there rea lly 
any pOint to a prequel that features no cle-
ments from the original? While the first film 
had you screaming with laught r. this film jUM 
had you screaming for it to end. 

Not all films were wrecks. howcvH 
"Pirates of the Caribbean" proved to be one 
of the best movies of the summcr. Not only 
was the plot entertaining and engaging, the 
aCling was om of the best all around. The 
always fantastic (and hot) Orlando Bloom lit 
up the screen as Wi ll Turner, and the chem-
istry between him and co-star Kiera Knightly 
lit up the screen. BUI no one shined more than 
Johnny Oepp as Captain Jack Sparrow. Dcpp's 
namboyant , over-the-top portrayal of 
Sparrow was the best thing about the film : the 
one-liners and physical gags were perfect for 
Depp. The combination of a brtlliant script 
and wonderful actors he lped make what Courtesy Ii 20th Centur; Fox 

Utter garbage: Kel~ Clarkson and Justin Guarini 
sing and dance their way out of promising careers. 

Then there was "Legally Blonde 2: Red , 
White and Blonde. - The first "Legally Blonde· 
was a lighthearted upbeat movie that had you 
leaving the theater smiling. On the oLher hand, 
"Legally Blonde 2" was a dull film that only 
picked up towards the end. While Reese 
Witherspoon was delightful as always. the con-
stant Valley-girl voice left you with a headache 
and an itch to slap the perkiness right out of 
her. The plot line was also a huge stretch and 
too many lines in this fil m were replicas of the 

last film 's high points. 
Like "Legally Blonde 2." "America n 

Wedding" failed to live up to ilS predecessors. 
Arter two movies of fairly humorous gross-out 
jokes. the pattern fall nat and becomes dull and 
uninspired. Besides the lame jokes. however, 
the fact that many members of the original cast 
weren't in the movie made "Wedding" seem 
pointless. And really, what happened to Mena 
Suvari , Chris Klein and Tara Reid? What 
important thing are these three doing that 
made it impossible for them to show up for the 
third film?

sa THE UCSD GUARDIAN I WELCOME WEEK SECTION 

The best of what's around and what's to come 
From hip-hop to indie rock, there's something for everyone among this fall's music. 

By BILLY GIL 
Associate Hiatus Editor 

Let's face it, you're definitely not 
going to be buying the new Britney 
Spears album this fall. For some 
actually good music, check out these 
albums in stores now. And for the 
ones not released yet , be sure to 
mark your calenders. 

In Stores : 

The Mars Volta 
Deloused at the Comatorium 

quite 
about failed 
You haven 't 
The Mars 

the band Omar 
Rodriguez-Lopez and Cedric Bixler 
Zavala formed after their former 
band At The Drive-In disbanded, 
have failed to live up to their obviou 
potential. 

Agreeing with this statement 
would refute these two facts: The 
Mars Volta are among the most 
enthralling performers alive, and 
Deloused In the Comacor/um is nothing 
short of consistently engaging, if 
uneven . Like the Tremulanc EP 
released last year, it points at greater 
thmgs to come. This is a new band, 
after all , havmg undergone lineup 
changes and the death of sound 
manipulator Jeremy Ward - and the 
album still sounds fantasuc. 

A m dley of "son et lumiere " 
and the Single "inerliatic esp" open 
the album with gorgeous electron-
ics followed by a tight but adven-
lurous fast -paced rocker. Most of 
the album's other eight tracks are 
over four minutes , one track 12 
minutes , but they maintain the 
energy and dynamics of the album 's 
powerful opening Whereas At the 
Drive- In fused emo, punk and art -
rock, The Mars Volta takes the 
sound a step further by allowing 
themselves to str tch beyond pop 
conventions By employing aspects 
as Latin pe rcussio n , alternating 
mathematically precise and wildly 
atonal mUSICianshIp. and showcas-
Ing BIXI ' r Zavala s wild Cedd 

Lee- i h vocals, The Mars Volta 
come up with something truly 
original and memorable. 

Even if the songs aren't as dis-
tinguishable as one would hope and 
the band's preten s can grow tir-
ing (J 2-and-a -half minute song 
called "cicatriz esp, : anybody?), 
The Mars Volta have proven their 
hype justified and will likely con-
tinue to create unique, challenging 
music such as this . They're just 
getting warmed up. 

The Raveonelles 
Chain Gang of Love 

~,,, nTr/l By now everyone must 
m ~!flJN~,,~~ have heard of The 

_..... Raveonelles. Bassist 
1IooO~.t. Sharin Foo is gor-
- •• _-•• geous and six feet tall. 

They're from Denmark. They're 
marketed as a boy/girl pair but are 
actually a quartet (and inCidentally 
sound nothing like The White 
Stripes and are not romantically 
linked) . But have you heard them 
yet? Here's the spoiler: if you've 
heard The jesus and Mary Chain, 
you 've heard The Raveonettes . 
They sound even more like them 
than Black Rebel Motorcycle Club 
does 

Bu t guess what? It doesn't maller 
- not when the results are as consis-
tently enjoyable as Chain Cang of 
Lovf'. Opener "Remember" is a dead-
ringer for "Just Like Honey: the 
opener of The Jesus and Mary 
Chain's landmark debut Pschtxandy, 
with its somber beat, slowly 
strummed electric guitar and bummer 
vocals . But "That Creat Love 
Sound," the second song and first sin-
gle, is entirely their own. Cuitar his5 
and sampled screams give way to a 
bone-simple three-chord romp with 
early 19605 pop-Inflected vocals coo-
ing softly about wanting to "scream 
and shout. " 

Other highlights include "The 
Love Gang" (unm!ssa!:>lp lyric: "here 
comes the love gangltwo delinquents 
in love ") and "lillie Animal " (second 
unmissable lyric "my girl IS a httle 
arumalh he always wants to fuck ") In 
both cases, th sound of f rontman 

Sune Rose Wagners and Foos Inter-
locking harmonious boy/girl vocals 
singing 1960s melodies over screanl-
ing guitars highlights the tension of 
the lyrics and of the decadence lying 
just below the sweetly innocent sur-
face. 

They don 't have their own 
sound yet, its true . They get close 
on "The Truth About Johnny," 
which utilizes a pulsa ting German-
inspired bass line to augment their 
sound . What they've achieved is a 
lovely homage to the America of 
early 1960s B- movies through the 
vein of their sometimes painfully 
obvious influences. Most of the 
songs are similar sounding, most of 
them are unoriginal and most of 
them are somehow great anyway. 
What 's astonishing is that they get 
away with it; Cbaln Cang of Love is 
consistent all the way through . 

The Raveonettes play the 
Casbah on Oct. 3. Sorry kids, it's 21 -
and-over. 

The Neptunes 
The Neplunes Present: Clones 

One of the ear's best 
hip-hop albums is a 
compilation of current 
and soon- to-be hits 

from the The best songs 
are Ludacris's "It Wasn't Us," which 
features the eptuncs' most adven-
turous beats to date that are so 
demented they're practically atonal. 
and PharreiJ and jay-Z's "Fronlin'" 
with Pharrell's endearingly bad-in-a-
good way sinRing voice and a gor-
geous bridge. There are also three 
terrible rock songs. Ignore them. The 
hip-hop songs, more often than not, 
are among the best the Neptunes 
have worked on (and thus, the best 
around) .

Andre 3000 have opted to release a 
double album of soio material from 
each of them (Big Boi 's is 
Speakerhoxx, Ore's is The LOlle 
Be/o\V) and releas multiple singles 
at the same lime. Current singles 
"Hey Ya: "The Way You Move " 
and "Chettomu ick " are so good it 
hurts , mashing up rap, rock, funk 
and a little bit of everything else 
with ecstatic energy. Their style 
has now become familiar to listen-
ers, but it's no less startling or 
groundbreaking than on previous 
releases, it's just been p rfected .

THE U D GUARDIAN I WELCOME WEEK SECTION B9 

Gone fishing: Simple rules of conduct toward celebs 
Learn everything you need to know to avoid looking like a fool in front of the stars 

short kids 
are cool , 

Mara Evans 

At this lime of year a large chunk of our campus population is new to San Diego and the "SoCal" 
area in general. If you are one of 
these new freshman or a transfer 
student, you might admit that If you 
were to bump Into justin 
Timberlake and Cameron Dlaz on 
the beach, you would tum Into a 
tongue-ti ed. stuttering, star-struck 
sheil of your former self. 

As novices It is understandable to 
have these anxiety attacks, but you 
have just stepped onto the ultimate 
playing fi eld for a pastime that I like 
to caU "fishing for mm stars.' The 
rules, in order to be a successful flsh-
ennan. are not hard to follow. You 
mighl even apply some to other areas 
of life, bUI the Important thing is to 
stick with them. 

This leads us to our first ru le: 
Don't let a good one slip away. A 
good film star fisherman knows that 
these stars are professional when it 
comes to dodging recognition. Take 
for example my encounter with 
Bono, from the Irish band U2, in 
San Diego's Little Italy. I walked out 
of a restaurant with some friends 
and realized that the man walking 
right past me was Bono. Yes, he was 
shorter than I imagined, but he was 
wearing Bono's trademark yellow 
sunglasses, and dammir it was him. 
Of course, I then had to convince 
th people I was with that this was 

Bono. As we wa lked to our car, Bono 
again walked by This lime my sister 
stopped him and sa id , "I have to ask: 
Are you that Singer from U2?" To 
which Bono responded with a full on 
Irish accent : "No, that's my broth-
er." 

We, of course, were left holding 
our leftovers looking at each other 
with no witty comeback in order to 
find out more . Bono was too slip-
pery for us. And our second ru le? 
Have an o pe ning lin ready to 
approa ch your 

" 

think you are?" to wh ich johnny 
smi! d and shook her hand. Should 
you find yourse lf in this predica-
ment, execu le rule two with a line 
that does not reqUire you to know 
the star 's name. 

Rule four. Hopefully you ' ll agree 
that autographs are a real waste of 
paper. Plus, you 'll only embarrass 
yourself if you don 't have any paper 
and ha ve to ask to get your bra 
signed in the middle of a busy st reet. 
We are not trophy fishing , it 's for 

our own sense of fun , 
for the adventure , 
and even though 

catch with and a 
backup, too . 
Some like to use 
the ve rsati le 
"Hey, love your 
work! " You could 
also lead with 
"I'm sorry, you 
look really famil -
iar, are YOll Ifill in 
name herel?" 
Even though it's 
better to be cor-
rect, a mistake 
might leave the 
person flattered 

Remember the cUche 
'farrwus people are 
just like the rest of 
us' , " we just have 
w bridge a million 

we 're not climbing 
M t. Everest, we are 
testing our own lim-
its . 

Rule fiVe . It 's 
crucial that you do 
not make an ass of 
yourse lf in front of a 
star. Remember that 
you walk inlO the sit-

dollar gap, " uation with the 
upper hand . You 

to be thought of as someone rich 
and famous. T he point is not to be 
overly obvious to the people around 
you and not to pester your target. 
Remember peop le, this is a ca tch 
and release program! 

Rule three. It is cru cial to at least 
know the name of the person you're 
about to talk to . One woman I know 
practically ran into Kate Moss and 
johnny Depp leaving a store in Los 
Angeles. As she realized that this 
scruffy man was someone famous, 
she also realized that she had no idea 
what his name was. So she s tuck out 
her hand and said, "Are you who I 

have the means to 
know everything 

about this person : Iheir dress size, 
their fertility problems, Iheir sexu-
al preferences and even their dri · 
vi ng record They, on the 0 ther 
hand , know nothing about you and 
- let's be honest - they could prob -
ably care less . The poinl is not to 
turn yourself into a story. Imagine 
Jennifer Aniston going home and 
tell ing Brad Pitt: "Honey. I was al 
the store today and some gi rI said 
hello to me and then fainted dead 
away." Talk about embarrassing 

Rule six. When approaching 
your film star be sure to be polite 
(obviously, this rule nles for any per-

son you meet) . bUI be prepared ~ r 
some nldeness on their part . YOLI 

hav~ the element of surprise on YOllr 
side - they might be in their 
bathrobe gelling coffee. Or, in other 
cases, you might catch them on 
vacation. Alex Kingston . from the 
TV show "ER. " was not too happy 
to be spotted while on a safari in 
Kenya. Honestly, did she really 
think no one watches "ER " In the 
African bush? 

Rule seven . On that nOle , don 't br 
nervous. AI some point in Iheir career 
this multi -Oscar winner YOIl ' rt> abOlll 
to approach had stage fright too Blil 
if lhey can play drug lords. hit men or 
an e lf, I'm sure thai you can slimmon 
up enough courage to otTer a smile 
and a "hello" Remember, in a movie 
star 's job description, right under 
"diva" it says: "is willing to play ni e 
wi th strangers. " 

Rule eight. Do not let down your 
guard Remember the clich "famous 
people are just 1 i ke the resl of us " To 
a certain extent thaI 's true. we jusl 
have to bridge a million-dollar gap. I 
followed a movie star-looking woman 
around a grocery store once, bUI 
before I could execute rule twu. ,he 
disappeared into the frozen food sec 
tion . I was also in a car on Rodeo 
Drive when I pa cd Tom Arnold 

0, I didn't crash. 
Rule nine. Most importantly, do 

not let this new sport consume YOllr 
life or soon there will be a restrainrng 
order with your name on it. We, as 
loyal movie watchers and concerlgo-
ers , have helped to pay for these stars 
careers. While we must hone our ath· 
letic mm star fishing skills, this IS a 
sport, and if you get a contra t and go 
pro , you 'll be playing for a new tam: 
the paparazzi.

Zambian kindness: Peace Corps volunteer and UCSD graduate student Kris Kohler was amazed by the community Splfit among the people In Zambia, who despite 
poverty and famine were fnendly and willing to share what they had. 

A fter a long day of cam-paignmg for the presiden -cy. John F Kennedy arrived 
at the University of Michigan on 
Oct 14 . 1960. at 2 a.m. hoping to 
catch some sleep. What he found 
were over 10.000 students waiting 
to hear him speak. He issued the 
challenge that would begin a bold 
experiment in public service. How 
man of them. he asked . would be 
willing to serve their country and 
the cause of peace by living and 
working in the developing world? 
The r action was enthusiastic. and 
within a year the Peace Corps was 
born . 

Since the program began In th 
summer of 1961 . 170.000 Peace 
Corps volunteers have served in 
136 countries. travelling every-
where from Afghanistan to 
Zambia to fulfill their mandate to 
promote "world peace and friend -
ship" through three goals: to help 
the people of interested countries 
and ar as meet their needs for 
tram d workers; to h Ip promot 

a better understanding of 
Americans; and to help promote a 
better understanding of other 
peoples by Americans. 

Decades of Service 
Kennedy made good on his 

challenge to the students of the 
University of Michigan when he 
created the Peace Corps organiza-
tion by executive order on March I . 
196!. By the time the first assign-
ments were planned. the Peace 
Corps received over 5.000 applica-
tions. In the summer of 1961 . the 
51 inaugural volunteers left for 
Ghana and . upon landing at the air-
port, impressed the locals and offi-
cials by breaking into a chorus of 
the Ghanaian nalional anthem in 
Twi. the local language. 

The experiment in international 
development was surprising and 
exciting to the participating coun -
tries. as well as to th American 
people. John Coyne. one of the 
early volunteers who served In 
Ethiopia from 1962 to 1964 . 

" We were front~page 
stories in newspapers as 
diverse as the New Yark 

Times and the Kalamazoo 
Gazette." 

- John Coyne. 
Peace Corps vOlunteer 

de cri bed the allitude~ of the day 
on the Peace Corps Web site. 

"We were the Peace Corps. the 
shiny new creation that PreSident 
Kennedy had proposed in the last 
days of his 1960 campaign . his 
experiment in international devel -
opment. Everyone. it seemed. was 
impressed: Coyne said. "That 
summer. all across the country. our 
nam s were read on our lora l news 
stations on the days w departed for 
training. We were front -page sto-
ries in newspapers as diverse as the 
New York Times and the Kalamazoo 
Gazelle. We were on the evening 
news with Walter Cronkite and 
Huntley and Brinkley." 

Since then. the Peace Corps has 
continued to grow and expand its 
programs. In addition to moving 
into many more countries. the 
organization has creal d ampaign 
and assignments that address prob 
lems 5p cific to certain regions . 
such as the African Food Service~ 
Initiative . to ombal famlO and 
malnutrition. After 40 y ars. the

Contributing Writer 

Adju ting to UC D's location 
and surroundings was a task that 
UC D School of Medici ne alumna 
Heidi Feldman had to complete 
during her stay at UCSD in the 
seventies. Like many UCSD stu-
dents, she had to learn to balance 
beach time with work while in 
medical school. 

"1 had to really buckle down, 
because it was such a shock to be in 
such a beautiful place and have to 
tudy," Feldman aid . 

Today, after seven year at 
UC D chool of Medicine and 
more than 24 years after her gradu-
ation, Feldman is a renowned 
leader in her field of behavioral-
developmental pediatrics. 
Although Feldman completed her 
undergraduate work at the 
University of Pennsylvania, she fol-
lowed her boyfriend, now husband, 
down to San Diego for medical 
school. He was an assi tant profe -
sor in the psychology department 
at UCSD and they were married 
while she wa attending medical 
school. 

Feldman is currently 3 professor 
of pediatrics al the Unive~sity of 
Pittsburgh medicaJ school and also 
directs the Univer ity, Community, 

Leaders and Individuals with 
Disabil ities Center at the 
University of Pittsburgh , a multi-
disciplinary leadership develop-
ment program in neurodevelop-
mental di abi lities. 

Yet Feldman's work does not 
end at the teaching level. Feldman ' 
typical week consists of teaching 
graduate students, clinical activity, 
seeing patients, seminars with psy-
chologists, nurses, doctOrs, social 
workers and public health officer, 
as well as the collection and analy-
sis of new re earch. 

Additionally, Feldm an spend 
much of her time doi ng advocacy 
work. he currently serves on many 
respected and recognized boards 
and national comminces regarding 
developmental-behavIOral pedi -
atrics and is a member of the 

American Academy of Pediatrics, 
working extensively in the fi elds of 
genetic disorders, Anention Deficit 
Hyperactive Disorder and language 
impairment. 

Feldman cites her education at 
UC 0 as a major parr of the prepa-
ration for her job today. 

"I think I got an outsmnding 
education at UCSD," Feldman 
said. "I felr prepared at many dif-
ferent levels and I felt that my edu-
cation was every bit as good as 
[everyone else'] ." 

Feldman also aid that opporn,-
nities at UC D, outside of her books 
and classe , were part of her most 
valuable car er and life experiences 
and influences. he said tha t at 
UCSD he was gwen many leader-
shIp opportunities to shape the way 
all student were educated, as well as 
her own personal education. 

"That experience at UCSD has 
stood me in very good stead," 
Feldman said. "I very expli irly talk 
to smdents about leadership oppor-
tunities. It is such an opportul1lty to 
be able to articulate a vision and lry 
and implement the vision." 

These opportunities included 
helping to shape and teach a cour e

Young San Diegan students 
won't have to worry about too 
many boring lecmres from their 
teachers this year. 

"[No student] wants a teacher 
who sits at the front of the clas 
and just talks for an hour," sa id 
Hiram Gonzalez, a ocial mdies 
and world history teacher at 
Standley Middle School in San 
Diego. 

So while local schoolchildren 
were enjoying their summer vaca-
tions, many of their teachers were 
busy developing multimedia tech-
nology at a summer computer-
technology training camp, 
TeacherTECH, at the San Diego 
Supercomputer Center at UCSD. 
The two-week training course, 
based on a similar program at Rice 
Univer ity in Houston, was first 
organized in 200 I by SO C edu-
cation department director 
Rozeanne teckler. 

Held each summer, the pro-
gram was formed in 1998 with a 
grant from the ational Science 
Foundation to develop human 
resources across a wide range of 
cience disciplines by u ing innov-

ative new information technolo-
gies. 

When TeacherTECH first 
began, the goal was to bring 
technology into the classroom. 
Since then, the goal remains the 
same, but the program has been 
refined, taking into account the 
needs and skill level of the 
schoo lteachers, because some 
teachers did not have the skills 
necessary to take the initial 

course. The program now offers 
a computer basics course to help 
teachers learn to use computers 
and technology effectively in 
addition to a course on interac-
tive curricu lum design. 

Participants in this year's pro-
gram had high expectations. 

"All of these teachers were 
very determined to be more effec-
tive in their classrooms while also 
providing much more engaging 
learning experiences," 
TeacherTECH instructor Anne 
Bowen said. 

The unique program was 

" I went home exhausted 
every day far the two 

weeks , but I felt 
engaged, inspired and 

motivated. " 
- Leslie Gushwa, 

teacher, San Dieguito High 
School Academy 

attended by twelve elementary, 
middle school and high school 
teachers from Borrego Springs, 
Encinitas, San Diego, San 
Dieguito, E condido and an 
Marcos, most of whom signed up 
on their own. 

"The teachers have told us 
there's nothing like this out 
there," said Ange Mason, project 
manager for education for D C. 

With an idea of what they 
wanted to accomplish before they 
began their cour e, the teachers 
developed projects in nearly all 
subject areas, including math, 
social science, writing and physical 
education. 

"They thought [the technolo-
/''YJ would be a wonderful tool to 
help children learn," t\la on said. 

TeacherT , ~CH was especially 
valuable 10 teachers who did nor 
yet have tl,e skills to crcate their 
own educational modules. Leslie 
Gushwa, an accomplished \'Veb 
page designer and a former an 
Diego County Teacher of the Year 
from San Dieguito High School 
Academy in Encinitas, had an idea 
for an asuonomy laboratory tuto-
rial but didn't know how to create 
it. TeacherTECH instructors 
assisted her with programming 
steps needed to make her idea pos-
sible. 

"1 went home exhausted every 
day for the twO weeks, but 1 felt 
engaged, inspired and motivated," 
she aid. 

Around California and across 
the country, multimedia content 
has become a popular way to 
engage technology-savvy students. 
Hiram Gonzalez, who de\eloped a 
" 1ummie for Dummies" project 
for a ocial stl,dies class, o;ay that 
he and other teacher are wking 
advantage or multimedid teaching

FAQ on REEF Financing 
Question: How are Education Investments different from a loan? 

Answer: Loans are sums of money lent at interest. Education Investments 
are sums of money disbursed to students at no interest. The 
obligation of an Education Investment is based on a fIXed percentage 
of future income for a fixed period of time. This program allows 
flexibility in obligation according to your economic situation. 
Which means, you pay less when you have less and more when you 
have more. 

Turn your passion into a profession -
Earn College Credit at the same Time 

Question: Can these Education Investments pay for all of my tuition? 
Answer: Education Investments are a great complement for students that 

have already received grants, scholarships and federal loans, but 
still need more money for their living costs. REEF can help students 
fill the gap between what you have and what you need. REEF will 
fund a maximum of $7000 for cost of living expenses per school 
year. 

Question: How does this affect my Financial Aid package? 
Answer: Education Investments will not affect your Financial Aid package. 

REEF works closely with the Financial Aid Office and the Student 
Business Office at UCSD to ensure Education Investment 
disbursements fit into your cost of living package. As opposed to 
increasing the amount of loans you are responsible for, you now 
have an alternative way to finance your education that's more 
sensitive to your future ability to pay. 

Question: How are these percentage rates determined? Will they change 
throughout the life af the abllgatlon? 

Ann.: Percentage rates begin: 
0.1-/_ for graduate students (1/10 of one percent) 

O.~/_ for undergraduate students (1/5 of one percent) 
Rates are specific to each applicant. Education Investments are 
awarded on a case-by-case basis. The more information a student 
gives REEF, the more accurately a rate is determined. Students are 
encouraged to infonn REEF about their goals, career plans, internships, 
major, test scores, CPA and anything else they think is relevant 
regarding their future.

I THE EDITORS' SOAPBOX 
There is change in the air at UCSD 
Opportunities abound at the Guardian in the Fall 

By EVAN McLAUGHLIN 
Editor in Chief 

As far as seasons go, fall is the 
season most closely associ a ted wi th 
word like "change" and "transi-
tion," or "Halloween costume and 
keg party." Joking aside, many of 
you picking up this paper are 
undergoing a significant change in 
your life. 

Johnny, the wide-eyed fresh -
man is changing his us ual mid-
night bedtime to compensate for 
the noise coming from his sui tem-
ate playing uper Smash 
Brothers all night while also 
adjusting to the fact that he does-
n 't bavl to go to class if there i a 
baseball game on TV or if a hang-
over is pounding mallets into his 
forehead. Caron, the glad-to-be-
ou t -of- m y-s hi tty- s m a 11 - town 
transfer student, has ditched her 
dingy community college trailer-
home classroom for the behemoth 
H&SS lecture hall. And Sally 
Goodie-Goodie has discovered 
that her high school boyfriend is 
already cheating o n her after 
promising to be loyal "no matter 
how far apart we arc," so she takes 
a liking to strong drink and the 
exchange student down the hall . 
The tragic tradition of growing up 
live on for yet another year. 

And with changes come deci -
sions, just as how a poke r pl ayer can 
fold, stay or raise as he sees his 
cards and the pot develop. 
Whether you're a new student at 
UCSD or a Triton veteran, chances 
are you are looking for new oppor-

" Whether you're a new 
student at UCSD ar a 
Triton veteran, chances 
are you are looking far 
new opportunities this 

coming year, in the true 
sense of the coUege 

experience. " 
tumtles this coming yea r, in the 
true sense of the college experi-
ence. There are several student 
organizations and job opportunities 
available at U SD, but I think that 
students often overlook the 
GUIlrdia71 as a viable and worth-
while extracurricular experience 
while they're here. 

It is again fall , which spells not 
only a change for you but al 0 for 
the Guardian. We will be hiring 
interested students of all commit-
ment levels in the next few weeks 
to round out a staff that garners 
awards in every section of our 
paper. The return ing staff has 
been working very hard to 
improve their respective areas of 
our independent newspaper, but 
why ca n't you be involved in th is 
exciting and rewarding process as 
well? 

At the beginning of my second 
year at UCS D , I took a chance on 

a change when J applied to th e 
Guardian as a news wri ter. My 
freshman year was not unlike 
many of yours, as it involved a lot 
of beer, wiffle ball and movi e 
watching. And while I studi ed 
hard that year, I still believed that 
I could make a better use of my 
spare time to prepare me fo r what 
is to come afte r college. I didn't 
know how I wanted to make a liv-
ing then , and ['m not too certai n I 
know anymore about that subject 
now, but what] do know is that 
my experi ence at the Guardian has 
hel ped mc anain real-life expcri-
ence about politics, journalism, 
business and professionalism that 
will prepare me for a number of 
prvfe sions when I gmduate. 

T he paper publishes twice a 
week and boa ts a circulation of 
11 ,000. Opportunities are available 
in all five ections - news, opini on, 
features, hiatus and sports - and in 
our copy, photography, design and 
graphics departments. 

The news section is rcspon ible 
for bringing campus and UC sy -
tern news to the UCS D publ ic. 

ews writers will prepare tories by 
attending events and conducting 
research and inte rviews. T he polit-
ical and cultura l intricacies of 
UCSD are a micr cosmic repre-
entation of the world around u , 

and covering the c issues at the 
campu level i beneficial to indi-
vidual who wish to pursue the e 
issues in any capacity after gradua-
tion . Frequent topics covered in

the market system. 

Things to Can ider 
As Kennedy said when he creat-

ed this program, "life in the Peace 
Corp will not be easy ... but if the 
life will not be easy, it will be rich 
and satisfying." The Peace Corp 
can be a rewarding experience, but 
it is not for everybody. It is key lO 
remember that it is in fact a job and 
should be treated as such . 
Volunteer are expected lO work 
right along ide the locals, eat the 
same food and share in the same 
custOms. To anyone con idering 
serving, first think carefully about 

these areas: 
oMake sure you're fam il iar 

with the goals and philosophy of 
the Peace Corps. This will be the 
philosophy you are co mmiltcd to 
for twO years, so be sure it is 
something you can live with. To 
get a basic understanding of their 
goals visit their Web site, 
bttp://www.ploworps.gov.This 
will provide detailed information 
o n the programs avai lab le and 
what you will be doing during 
your stay. 

oTalk to returned volun teers. If 
you want the scoop on the experi-
e nce without the public relations 
glos of the official Web site, 
speak to sOll1eone who's lived it. 
However, si nce experiences are 0 
personal, you may get a ealth of 

information that is highly ubiec-
tive and not necessarily useful to 
you. Try asking pecific questions 
instead of, "So, what did you like 
about it'" 

• Realize you will be spending 
twO years away from home. This is 
one of the most important areas to 
con ider because this is really a 
commitment. You'll be spending 
two years far from family and 
friends in a place that very well may 
have big bug, dirty water or no 
electricity. Once you get lhere, 
there will not be the time to rca I i1.C 
that you can't live wilhout 

tarbucks and "Friends." J liSt 
because this is volunteer work 
docsn't mean you can back out uf It

C orp experience something ou 
can't get an other way." 

Educational Opportunities 
The Peace Corps also off rs 

two unique further education pro-

they spend one year studying on 
campus and the next two years 
earning academic credit while 
working overseas on a Peace 
Corps project. 

The Fellows/USA program 
offers scholarships or reduced 
tuition for graduate programs at 
over 30 universities when volun-
teers return from their service. In 
return for these benefits. which 
can include hOUSing allowances, 
paid employment or health bene -
fits . the Fellows make a commit-
ment to work in an und rserved 
U .S. community while they pur-
sue their degree. This can mean 
teaching in public school, work -
ing in public health facilities or 
working on community develop-
ment projects with nonprofit 
organizar,ions.

Swanson hopes to gain a new per-
spective through his experience

"After going to school so long 
and putting time In my own stud -

thought it would be a good 
opportunity. as cliched as It 
sounds. to help the needy in 
other countries." he a'd . "These 
are countries you read about in 
the news, but I want to d velop a 
greater understanding and heart 
to help them." 

The international work helps 

many volunteers understand their 
own goals better and see the real 
world benefits of their education. 

"The experience of concrete 
work helped me see a link 
between my university educaLion 
and the real world ." Kohler said . 
"It got me focused on graduate 
school , learning more and edu -

o 0 m s 
M~on agrees that the use of 

computers In classrooms IS b com-
ing IIlcreasingly Important. 

"With computers In every sin -
gle classroom. and by haVing 'stu-
dentsl learning on computers , It's 
the way of th futur : she said . 
"Bringing technology Into th 
classroom makes learning much 
mar engaging for students, slllce 
they can Interact as they learn." 

According to Mason . It 'S 
inevitable that more students wlll 
be using such 
technology in the classroom in th 

future. 
The technology developed at 

TeacherTECH has received praise 
from outside the classroom as 
well. One of last year's partici-
pants, John Bana , a math teacher 
at Balboa Elementary School in 
San Diego. won a S I 00 merit 
award at th 2003 "SIGKids" 
competition for a multim dia 
math project. SDSC's Rozeanne 
Steckl r was plea~ed by the award . 

",It, shows that In a two-week 
course, we can g,ve skills to teach-
ers who otherwise know very little 
about information technology: she 
said . "And thes skills can enable 
teachers to develop award -Winning

"Misunderstood " got a new treal-
ment with atonal chords, brcaking 
Lip thc original arrangement in thc 
midd le of the song, showing an 
obvious affinity for nOisemakers 
Sonic Youth . with whom th y 
recently toured . 

Songs from past releases. such as 
2002's critic favoritc Yankee Hotel 
Foxtrot. were spliced with new songs 
that were noticeably harder rocking 
and more chaotic. On one song, 
Tweedy screamed. "I've b en working 
on my abs!" with a loveable insanity 
known to great punk and post -punk 
bands. not pretty IIttlc alt -country 
ones. The tag no longer uits them. 
They've learned a thing or two over 
the years and their performance 
showed that Yallkee Hotel Foxtrot was 
no nuke: this is one of the best bands 
on the planet. 

The last two performances I wit -
nessed were polar opposites: 
resounding success and utter fail -
ure . Thc failure : the Sex Pistols , 
one of the first and great 5t punk 
bands. Th y brokc up after only Iwo
