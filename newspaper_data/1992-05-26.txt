UCSC Faculty Ries Complaint 
AgaInst Regents Over Pay Raises 

It has been more than two years since faculty members 
al the University of California have received any salary 
increases and one year since they have received any meril 
increases. 

But the UCSC faculty is not concemod with Ihe money, 
but with the university's failure to consult wWt faculty 
before suspending merit increases. 

"Our aim is to achieve the right to be cortsulted on the 
issue," said John EUis, chair of he UCSC Faculty Asso-
ciation. " Any decision haS 10 be talked over firsl before it's 
implemented." 

In January, the UCSC Faculty Association, in con-
junction wilh the UC Counci I of Faculty Association, filed 
an unfair practice charge with the California Public Em-
ployment Relations Boord (CPERB) agaiflSt the UC Re-
gents. 

The complaint tates that the regents violated state law 
by failing to "meet, confer and consult" with faculty on 
issues affecting salary and work conditions before decid- ' 
ing 10 suspend their merit increase . 

Merit increases are awarded to exceptional faculty 
members, but because of the UC's budget shortfall, the 
regents have suspended increases until July I , 1992. 

Last month, the Office of the General Counsel of 
CPERB found the complaint,valid and gave Ihe university 
20 days to respond to the allegations. 

Although the official deadline was May 8, the univer-
sity was given an extension until May 15 to respond to the 
charges. 

Now .. an infonnal conference exploring the possibility 
of voluntary resolution and settlement is being arranged. 

According to leff Frumkin, assistant din:ctor of the 
UC's OffaceofEmployment Relations, the university did 
not meet the requirement of Ihc law. . 

1be university does not believe !hat it aaed inappro-
priately or unlawfully in die manner it infonncd the UCSC 
faculty," Frumkin said

Gardner AppoInts Ad I JInIstIative Group 
To Ease Presidency's Transition Period 

TIle University of California's outgoing and incorning 
presidents have appointed a 12-member Transition Planning 
Group to assist with the institution's change in leadership and, 
to begin shaping plans to confront the UC' most challenging 
issues. 

David Gardner. who will relinquish the presidency to lack 
Peltason on Oct. 1. wrote a letter to the UC Board of Regents 
this month outlining the duties of the advisory group and 
identifying UCLA Chancellor Charles Young as its chair. 

In a jointly written letter to members of the Transition 
Planning Group, Gardner and Peltason asked them not only 10 
address the problems confronting the university as a result of 
the current tate fi~a1 crisis, ~but also the longer-term 
issues that the university will face in what we believe will be 
a substantially changed environment for public highereduca-
tion in the stale of California, .. Gardner and Peltason wrote. 

V. Wayne Kennedy. UCSD vice chancellor of adminis-
tration. will be one of the committee members. 

In his letter to the regents, Gardner also announced that 
Ronald Brady, his senior vice president for administration 
since 1983, had informed him of his decision 10 slepdown on 
July I, 1993. 

Senior Vice President William Frazier will leave his posl

make the crowning glory of hi s ad-
mini tration the gutting of San Di-
ego tate:' 

Brown said Wilson is making 
unnecessaf)'. politically-motivated 
cuts to state university budgets. 

"Hey Pete, you . pent :! mil-
lion gett ing e lec ted governor. so 
maybe you could solve some prob-
lems [wi th the stat<:,educat ion sys-
teml." Brown yelled loward televi-
sion cameras. 

The candidate critiqued the u e 
of large, unneeded administrations 
in the operation of universi ties. "Be-
fore CUlling clas est they should cut 
the administration:' he said. 

The "cancerous growth" in tu-
dent fees over the last decade will 
only raise an economic barrier 10 
keep out qualified people, he added. 

The SDSU students fi,lOkin g 
Brown seemed to s upport hi s 
agenda, waving banners with slo-
gans such as " HigherTeachers, Not 
Fees." 

When questioned about a pe-
ci fic plan to revive education, how-
ever. he fa iled 10 mention any tac-
tics he would u e. Brown seemed to 
feel that questions of educatiomll 
reform directed at him were nO[ 
specific enough . 

" You' re in education, how do 
we need to refOim you?" Brown 
asked one student who had ques-
tioned him on his educational re-
form plan. 

Brown blamed many of the ills 
of modem America on outmoded 
budgetary planning based on past. 
not future , needs. As ,10 example. he 
cited the expend itures for the de-

fen se of Europe against the bank-
rupt Russian army. 

He also derided a congressional 
expendi tu re for ea Wolf subma-
rines. which he said even the admi-
rals did not want. 

Brown ~uggestcd that militaf)' 
ea Wolf ~ubmarines could serve a 

civi lian u. e by becoming ~huttles 
between anDi-
eg andDtalina 
island.

4 OPINION 

By Philip Michaels 
Associate Opinion EdItor 

o mallcr how unpredictable the world 
i ~, no matter how out of whack the co mo~ 
may seem, there will alway~ be a few 
indisputable universal given:- to fall back 
on. The sun will always rise in the cast. One 
plus one will always equal two. And Dan 
Quayle wi ll always. always, make an ass of 
himself. You can set your watch to it. 

The latest Dan Quayle blunder ex ploded 
onto the ~ene last week when the vice 
pre!>ident lashed out at television charJcter 
Murphy Brown for having a child out of 
wed lock. Quayle, it seems, wanted to blame 
the rioting in L.A. on a decline in family 
values as symbol ized by that villainous 
tramp Murphy and her bastard love child. 

Ignoring the somewhat disturbing 
reali zation that the Vice President of the 
Un ited States is unable to distinguiSh 
between fantasy and reality, this entire 
incident underscores Whal 'S wrong wi th the 
Bu h administration and Quayle, in 
part icular. 

Quayle has a storied history of incompe-
tence when it comes to publ ic speaking. At 
u speech for the United Negro College 
Fund. Quayle told his audience, "Indeed, 
what a terrible thing it is to waste one's 
mind." 

But this nap over Murphy Brown 
distinguishes ibclffrom Quay le's more 
infamou:, boner.., which were generally 
unrehear..ed slips of the tongue. His late!>t 
gaffe was carefully planned out. 

The Bu,h t1mllli,tratioll. in it'. ne <:r-

• Dan Quayle' late t blunder i more than just the 
u ual di play of idiocy - it proves, without a doubt, 

that the vice president i out of touch with the country 
he' been elected to serve 

c o M M E N T A R y 

T uesday, May 26, 1992 

made me want to commit un!>peakable 
atrocities against civi lization (or. at least. 
Bob Saget). but 10 blame the recent tiOling 
on TV is incredibly simple-minded. 

Whether jUl> tifiable or not, the rioting 
wa a result of frustration - both with an 
unrespon ive and arbitr.uy system of justice 
and stifl ing economic conditions. Claiming 
that the rioters were just "bad people" may 
be a nifty pu bl ic relations ploy. but it doe~ 
nothing to uddress the causes of the 
violence. or more importantly. rectify the 
conditions that caused the violence in the 
first place. 

The reason is simple - the Bush 
Administration really has no intention of 
address ing racial tensions. TIle president is 
ju ttrying to sweep the issue under the rug 
and hope that no one notices the stink until 
after November. 

But there's more to Quayle's blather 
than just a myopic point of view about race 
relations. By criticizing the char.lcter of 
Murphy Brown. Quayle was implying thut 
single mothers are unfit parents. In the 
alternative universe where the vice presi-
dent resides, women apparently don't cut 
the mustard when it comes to rearing 
children by themselves. 

A traditional family isn' t always 
possible to have. Furthermore. two parents 
are not necessarily better than one. Inm,my 
si tuations, a single parent. whether u man or 
a woman, is pre fera ble to having both 
parents who neither love nor want the child. 

Perhaps the tradi tional fami ly model 
with two parents can be recognized 'L~ an 
ideal. But like it or not. society has 
changed. To claim otherwise is to 
permanentl y dwell in Fantasyland. 

111at sum:- up the ent ire problem with 
Dan Quayle and his latest success with 
putting his foot in hi:, mouth. Quayle is out 
of touch with the rest of America. His grasp 
on rea lity and on the problems facing this 
nation is a tenuous one at best. 

The problem wi th Quayle is the same 
problem that plagues the Bush Adminis tra-
tion - nei ther one really understands the 
needs of the citi zens they are supposed to 
represent. 

And, un fortunately, there 's no more 
obvious uni versal given than that. 

Nine Easy Steps To Publishing A Right-Wmg Rag 
What th is campus needs is a good 

right-wing publication, not the namby-
pamby sissy-ass rag we have now. 

The problem with the Ca7ifol'llia 
Review (CR) i that they don' t have the 
guts to go fo r the jugular when it comes 
to truly reactionary polit ics. Sure, some of 
those little quotes on the back page are 
kind of clever, but they hardly comprise a 
conservative manifesto. 

Now, if I were the editor of the CR, I 
would do things differently. Here 's my 
free advice to those of you who are 
publishing that austere magazine. as to 
how you can really atlractthe right-wing 
fringe at UCSD: 

I. Ask irrelevant questions during 
interviews. Forget that you are a student 
publication. When interviewing former 
Secretary of Education Bill Bennett. the 
eR actuall y asked him questions about 
educmion. What we re you thinking? The 
conservatives on campus rea lly appreci-

ate irrelevance, being 
largely irrelevant 
themselves. One 
should strive to be 
irrelevant, while at the 
same time impress ing 
people with one 's 
knowledge of ancient 
Greek philosophy. For 
example: 

CR: III Ir is al/egO/y 
of the cave, Plato argues that what we 
call kllow of life is merely slladows 0 11 tfrc 
lI'al/. Do ),ou/hillk fi e is essellfially 
corrcCt? 

Hitler: All sexual deviants must be 
eliminated. 

CR: A I/d what u/}out Arislotle's 
clelegariol/ of RflelOric to a fesser (I1'/? 

Hitler: I thought there were going to 
be refre~hments here ... 

2. Work closely with the opinion 
ection of the Guardial/. Be a fOOllCr 

Guardiall associate 
opinion editor 
yourself. Get the 
current opinion 
editor to staff for 
you. Get the 
associate opinion 
editor to re-interpret 
Shakespeare. Get 
the design editor to 
make the thing look 

nice. Make it perfectly clear that there is 
no difference between the editorial policy 
of your own mag and that of the campus 
new paper's. 

3. Print more Paul Eykamp! This will 
lend credibility to your publication, since 
you can call him an " in. ider." and thus, 
an expert . (This, by the way, is true: I can 
personally attest to seeing Eykamp 
leering at Food Co-op wolters near the 
day-old bagel bins.) 

4. Print empty critiques of other 

publications, whether on-campus or off. 
Sure, in the latest issue the CR shot peas 
at Chris Conway of the Guurdiall, Vo; 
Frollteri;a and the Koala. They also 
trashed off-campus mags like the SUII 
Diego Lesbial/ Press, the Phoellix and 
the Sail Diego Rcviell'. But that's not 
enough, 

In truth , none of these other organs 
really give a shit about what the CR 
thinks of them. Still, by naming other 
publications you give your publication a 
sense of credibility that it would other-
wise be lacking. And maybe the staffs of 
these other magazines will pick up yours 
to see if they are mentioned - at least 
this way, someone will pick it up. 

5. Be a selfish editor. Don't let 
anyone else write for the magazine but 
you. Why should you'! You ' re the editor. 
you get to do what you want. This avoid~ 
nasty editorial decisions like whose stuff

To Go Where No Government Has Gone Before We're looking

• The United State space program is a waste of time and money that should be spent elsewhere 
pace ... lhe final frontier. These are the 

oyages of the Space Shuttle Elldeal'Our. its 
continuing mission: 10 repair space debris, to 
explore new worlds in satellite wind w·wash-
ing and boldly go where no maintenance team 
has gone before! 

Two weeks ago NASA tried to make the 
latest shuttle mission a real media production. 
1be repair of a wayward communications satel-
lite by the pace-walking astronauts of the 
Elldeal'ourwas trumpetedasatriumphbyNASA 
ofiicials, especially its top administrator, Daniel 
Goldin. who told theLA. Timesthat thedifficul l. 
trial-and-errorspace rescue was just what NASA 
needed to restore confidence in the space pro-
gmm. Really? 

While we watched the astronauts in action, 
my neighbor John commented on the beautiful 
view of the planet eanh. I agreed and secretly 
wished the astronauts would move out of our 
way and let us have a better view. Two seconds 
later I wa~ ready to . witch the ch:mnel to the 
America's Cup.

if it is our destiny to have a space progmm, then 
why can't we have one that looks and sound!> 
better than the one we have now. lL'; well as one 
that at least renders an illusion of progress? 

An avalanche of hundreds of billions of 
dollars has gone into NASA and more is yet to 
come, with plans for a space station that will 
probably not be finished until long after all of us 
and our children are dead and buried. 

What are our priori ties? We have a world of 
unfinished business back on earth. and I can 
think of no wonhier way of going boldly where 
no one has gone before th:U1 by tackling . me 
age-old problems we should not hnve to live with 
in this ck'lY and age. For example, hunger in 
children, American lUld otherwise, is one fron-
tier r d like to see broken.

there was a rJY of hope in the 13.~t

"Is it really fair to 3.\k students to 
sub,idize a paper which a wide va-
riety find offensive and lacking in 
any redeeming value'. " 

Let's hope the A.S. doesn't take

level of bUIll-OUI." Edson added. 

However. Edson said Sunday 
that he thought the downtown march 
was successful. 

Wilson agreed, s:lying. "We 
don' t have as many substantial 
things to point to and say, look , thi s 
is what' s happening here [at UCS DI 
- we can onl y poin t to [SDSUI ." 

"What' s un fort umte is that the 
worst cuts in 60 years" will be an-
nounced th is . ummer, Edson said. 
He wamed that there could be a 
mid-year fee hike beyond 20 per-
cent. creati ng a total of $4.000 in 
fees fo r next year. 

Edson also sa id that UCS D As-
sociate Chancellor Donald Tuzin 
sugges ted a plan that . if imple-
mented. could make students who 
exceed a certain number of total 
credit to pay out-of-state fees. 

The rail y was re-con fi gured early 
Thursday when it was di covered 
that Governor Pete Wi lson would 
be in San Diego that afternoon. The 
foc us of the rally therefore shifted to 
moving demon~tmtors to downtown 
San Diego to protes t with SDSU 
students before the govemor. 

Govemor Wilson was in San 
Diego to attend a press conference 
at the office of State Representative 
Jeff Marsten. Wi.lson was lending 
his support to four Republican can-
didates. incl uding Marsten.

administr.Jtive items to be addressed. 

Siwabessy ~uid that the council 
held together pretty well during the 
ixweek wi thout ap resi lent.How-

ever. he said many items such as 
intemal appointmcnt . had t be po~t­
poned until a pre. ident was an-
nounced. 

" It might have set us back. but 
we did wh;lI we had to do. I wi~h the 
council would now get along so we 
can serve the students. There shou Id 
be no more division in council based 
on the pasl election." Siwabessy 
said. 

Holmes expressed a ~imilaropin­
ion. "I think the counci l has done u

ally shown through. Overall. though. 
the council was hindercd in that 
rhey did n t have any real direction

will subside now. Beyond this I

by the time the studellls atTived

his speech. taken phone call s at the 
representative's office and then de-
paned for the State BU ilding. 

Colin Wilson s(1id that the stu-
dents were prepared and knew to 
move on to the State Building when 
they got downtown. 

He said that the event W3.S very 
posi tive. us the protesters "gotqui te 
a bi t of press coverage .. .. On a 
couple of [TV channelsl we got a 
good message out. ,. 

"The govemor and the legi~la­
ture have been playi ng political 'hot 
potato: pas!>ing the buck. It looked 
good for students to be Ispeaking

Wilson estimated that IOOSDSU 
~lUdents were protesting. creating a 
large demonstration. "The whole 
back of the State Building was just 
covered with people," 

Hendded, "Both schools are,tal1-
ing to see that if we don't work 
together, we won' t [get anywhere J." 

Protesters from UCS D marched 
with SDSU students around Broad-
way Stree t downtown before dis-
persing at 4:30 p.m. 

Prior to leaving fo r downtown. 
Ed on and Leon addressed students 
on Califomia budgetary politics and 
the po sibi lity of further increases

President Bush. 

"For 10 years the Reagan lantil 
Bush administration hil~ cu t aid to 
studen ts. It ha~cu t Pel I Grants. work-
study and supplemental 0PPOI1U-
ni ty." he said. 

According ro Leon. the ave rage 
Pell Grant award dropped 33 per-
cent between 198 I and 199 1. He 
added thilt during that time period, 
student costs have risen 30 percent , 
but the re has only been an 18 per-
cent rise in income. 

Speaking in to a megaphone. 
Leon said that "one day the library 
wi ll be padlocked. classrooms will 
be empty." and students will wish 
they had spoken ou t sooner. 

Edson blamed the Ca liforn ia 
budget crisis on politics. "The gov-
emor is playing a political game to 
embarrass the Democrats and show 
that they can't balance budgets," he 
said. 

Predicting the future effects of 
fee increases on student popUlations. 
Edson sa id, "You're going to see 
fewer and fewer students of color." 

In an interview during the rally. 
Edson said that the smaller audi-
ence was detrimcntal to the 5t udent 
cause. " It shows the legislators thut 
students aren't concemed. It gives 
the wrong message to Icgislators 
who are debating the budget."

Track Speeds Into National Meet 
• Preview: Triton take 
15 athlete to Divi ion 
III champioship in 
Maine thi week 
By Gregg Wrenn 
Associate Sports Editor 

UCSD Tra k Head Coach Mark 
Stanfonh wa .. e ci ted. Or at l ea~t as 
excited a.\ the soft-spoken coach 
usually gets. 

"This i ~ the bcM men's team 
wc've ever taken to the nationals. 
B th the men and the women hove

,aid. Stanforth i~ talking about the 

CAA Divi!>ion III ational Cham-

Tri ton athletes. 

The meet. at Colby ollege in 
M aine, kicksoff on Wednesday and 
runs through aturday. Of the 15 
U SO athletes, nine are men. the 
largest numberthe Tri tons have ever 
taken. 

"Everybod we've got hasa shot 
at beingiU1 All -American," Stanforth 
!>aid . Leading the way for the Tri -
tons will be cot! Sargeant. compet-

Ah.An b cure TV reference-
now you can be sure that it's me 
who is writing this column. (And 
you·1I have to sit through one more 
of the e before I'm done.) Still , why 
am I, Baseball Eli ti t Boy, watching 
the Indy 500? 

J don ·t, as a rul e. watch automo-
bile races of any kind. In fact, Indy 
is the only r..tce J watch all year. 
Why? Not the rcason it eems mosl 
people do, which is to see spectacu-
lar crashes (there were more than 
usual this ye;Jr, by the way). TIle 
repercus ion of such crashes are 
far too serious for me to actually 
hope to see one. Ju I look at what 
happened to Jovy Marcelo, a 27-
year-old rookie driver who died 
when he hit the wall at a slow (for 
Indy) 172 mph. Look at the inj uries 
suf fered la t week by Rick Mc.a rs 
and Nelson Piquet. 

to concentrate on her spec ialties. 
Y vette M arzullo in the 400 

meters, the 4x 100 relay team, Jill 
Lyday in the discus and Renee 
Sprowl in the triple jump are other 
qualifiers for UCSD. 

··We ·ve got realistic expecta-
tions, and no matter what happens, 
this will bea pos itive experience for 
Ihe team. I think the high level of 
competition we face in the regular 
season wi ll defini tely help us in the 
meet," Stanforth saiu. 

What he is most concerned with 
is keeping the focus of the team on 
them'ielvcs. " What other teams do 
doesn·t impaci what we·re go ing to 
d . Just f ' u~ on whut you can con-
trol and forget everyth ing else. Our 
history ~how~ good perfonnancc~ 
in championships, becau~e our ath-
letes do a good job of preparing for 
them," StanfoI1h added. 

No, I can' t watch Indy just in 
hopes of seeing someone bite the 
wall. But there is a rea on I watch: 
that A ndrett i curse. 

Every year I pick M ario and 
Michael Andrett i as two of my fa-
vorites to win. Which me;Jns every 
year there's a Sunday in May where 
I sit in front of the telev ision and 
wait, patiently , for them to fall ou t of 
the fa e. 

They ' re rarely hun - though 
th is year a couple of the Andrettis 
had to go to the hospital. Most of the 
time the cun;e doesn't hun the bod-
ies o f the Andretti s - j ust their 
minds. They ' re riding along tine, 
ju t like Michael wa~ today, and 
suddenly their machines just give 
out. 

I guess Indy and the Andretti 
Curse are just part of a standard 
2Oth-century drama - Man versus 
Machine. Theendingisexactl y what 
you'd expect. of course. 

The machine wins every t ime.

dropped like a stone and ended up in eighth. "That thud 
you heard was Salem late fa lling off the leader board," 
Wydra said. 

TIle Tritons had second place within Iheir grasp. before 
Gustavus dolphus' John Lindqui t lepped in. 

" Ifhe had shot as low as 70, we would have fini shed in

By Justin Katz 
Contributing Writer 

I N NOVEMBER OF 1990 1WO UCSD students were pulled out of their regular lives and ordered into a war 
zone that few other students can actually 

comprehend. They were taken to the Middle 

East for what we called the Gulf War, the 

liberation of Kuwait or the war for oil, 

depending on who you ask. Whatever you 

call it, it was a reality. Matt Ferguson and 

Rex Huang, both hailing from Warren 

College, explained their very different 

experiences in the gulf, each showinl; 'hu'

not live on forn1er military bases as 
do the resident students of UCS D. 

AClUally. there were once two 
military bases on what is now the 
UCS D campus: Camp Callan and 
CampCalvin B. Matthe ws. The two 
camps were separated by the o ld 
Highway 101 (now Nonh Torrey 
Pines Road) which once ran straight 
through what is now Third College. 

Camp Callan. which stood where

Arabia on December 3 I. A couple of weeks laler we were sent 
to the fronl. I was in the 4th Light Armored Infantry - we 
drove Light Armored Vehi les (LA V). Our job was to m:.lke 
first contact with the enemy, and, depending on the s ituati n, 
either engage or delay them whi le waiting for backup. 

"The day the ground war started they'd had il. That day 
they all surrendered to u . There were 700 of them and only 
120 of u~, but they were in bad hape. outclassed and wounded. 
If they had guns they dropped them. I felt guilty that we had 
to fight them. It only caused us both a lot of pain.

We spenl right up 10 the ground war on the border of Ihen-
occupied Kuwait. We were set all along the border wi lh one

to ~e everything coming. 

"On January 17 the air war started. It wmo weird being on

barely become adults were e ' orting these older men as

ROTC 
ContInued from page S1 
communities. 1he second and third 
summer the candidates are taken out 
on first- and second-class cruises. 
where they work alongside enlisted 
members of the Navy. operJting 
weapons and navigalion sy tems. 
running the ships and generally 
:I.'>Suming the role of junior officer.;. 
These cruises teach the candidale,<, 
about what career goals they would 
like to pursue in the avy upon 
grJduution. 

Many of the 35 studems involved 
in the ROTC progrJlTt at UCSD are • 
in it becauseoflhescholarshipmoney. 
The Navy offers full three- and four-
year ~cholurships 10 qualified , 
applicants who are willing to serve 
fiveyears inthe avyorMarineCorps 
after grJduut ion. 

"1he ilCoolnn.hip is by no means a 
free ride. because you have to serve for 
;tl least five years." says Warren 
College sophomore Andy Pulley. :lll 

:I.~piJing naval a imor who is on full 
ilCho larship. "People who end up 
joining only because of the 
ilCholar.;hips end up leaving becau!-.C 
you really have to wanl to pal1icipale 
in the progrJlTt." 

Pulley cites discipline and cureer 
otienlUtion a.~ the two main benefiL~of 
the ROTC progmm. Upon grJduation 
fromsc landtheNROTCprogram. 
the avy commissions graduates to 
the nmk of ensign. They can then 
eitheranend tlightschool.getll·,signed 
to surface or sub fleets. apply for Ihe 

avy Seals progr.un or enter Ihe 
Marines at the mnk of midshipman. 

On the UCSD campus. the men 
:lIlcl women involved in Ihe NROTC 
progml1l also comprise the 00 Yachl 
Club. which i S lhesrudent org~lniz;.lI ion 
Ihey fonned ll~:l social bond bet ween 

Ihern'ie l vesandotherUCSDstudenl~. 
The 00 Yacht Oub is n.~ponsible for 
many of the social evems that lake 
place between lhe NROTC studenls 
and the rest of UCSD. 

The AffilY ROTC progmm is a 
little Jifferent. The students from 
UCSD meet twice a week at the S;Ul 
Diego Slale University cumpus for 
leader.;hip l:lbs and outdoor prJctice. 
TIle progrJlTt is set up in such a way 
that for the fir.;ttwo years. a candidate 
is not underanyobligalionorcomntcl 
to the AffilY. In these two years of the 
four-year progml11. lhe students are 
introduced to the progrJlTt and taught 
basic leadership prJCtices. 

TIlis (raining enables lhe cadets 10 
command and supervise each other. 
During Iheir Ihird and fourth year. 
studems are in charge of the younger 
classes involved in theprogrnm.ll1eir 
third year in the program prepares 
students for Advanced Crunp. This is 
:l six week camp at Fort Lewis, 
Washinglon, held the 'ummer after a 
student's junior year. The camp is 
designed to be a proficiency display 
and also an activity which helps the 
srudems decide which task they want 
to get involved in after gmdualion. 

1l1ere are three differenl paths a 
graduate can take after college: active 
duty.reservedutyorlndividuaJ Ready 
Reserve. The contractual obligation 
for scholarship studenL~ lasts eight 
yean>, and there is a great deal of 
competition to be commissioned for 
active duty. However. the progmrn at 
SDSU is one of the best in California, 
and isagreat help in geningthestudents 
commissioned. 

Aside from financial compen-
sationsandcan:erguidrulce. the ROTC 
progrJl1l provides good educ:Jtion for 
:l government or military science 
career. And for some. thetrus!. respect 
and profession:llism that are :In 
important element of the progr.lI1l
