New Birth Control 
Pill At SDSU 
SAN DIEGO - A controver-
sial birth control pill called 
Ovral is now being distributed 
by the Student Health Services 
at San Diego State University. 
According to Director of 
Clinical Services Dr. Gregg 
Lichtenstein, research indicates 
that this pill, laken orally, is 
effective up to 72 hours after 
having unprotected sex. 
Lichtenstein says that Ovral 
should not be confused with the 
abortion pill RU-486, and that 
side effects of using the Ovral 
technique are similar to those of 
regular birth control pills. 

Fraternity Danied 
Campus Status 
SAN DIEGO - Facing 
allegations of sexual assault 
and improper functioning as a 
residential fraternity, Nu AIph3 
Kappa was denied the renewal 
of their on-campus status in 
December by the San Diego 
State University Activities 
Policy Board. The victim of the 
alleged sexual assault came 
forward last October to ask the 
board to deny renewal of 
NAK's on-campus status. 
However, their status will be 
reconsidered in fall 1993, 
provided the fraternity has met 
certain conditions.

UC Funds Slashed in Governor's Budget 
ECONOMY: Proposed budget cuts could lead to a 
$2,500 fee increase; student leaders call for protest 
By Francisco DeVries 
News Editor 

State funding 10 the University 
of California has been slashed in the 
governor's proposed 1993-94 fiscaJ 
budget by $138 million over current 
funding. The proposed budget must 
now be approved by the legislature. 

Coming on the heels of thrcc 
straight years of massive budget 
cuts to the university system, UC 
officials are waming of further fee 
increases, massive layoffs and pay 
cuts to university employees. The 
university has already started trim-

ming enrollment for incoming flfSt 
year students and transfers. 

Chair of the Assembly Commit-
tee on Higher Education Marguer-
ite Archie-Hudson (D- Los Ange-
les), wanlCd on Friday that the pro-
pose<! budget cuts may lead to a 
$2,500 fee increase next year if the 
deficit is met solely by student fees. 

In the Friday press conference, 
Governor Pete Wilson acknowl-
edged that the budget was going to 
create a multitude of problems 
throughout thestate. llalso included 
cuts to community colJeges, the 

California State University system, 
health care, welfare and staLe gov-
ernment. 

The budget spared the belea-
guered publ ic sch Is from most of 
the cuts andactually increased fund-
ing to the State Department of Cor-
rections by six percent. 

TheacLual cut to the university is 
worse than $138 million, according 
to UC Office of the Pre ident 
Spoke man Mike Lassiter. The re-
gents had asked for a $105 million 
increase in state funding to maintain 
current operation levels and ac-
commodate anticipated increases in 
eligible graduating seniors.

Regent Appointment 
Draws Criticism 
By Sheryl Wolcott 
Senior Staff Writer 

A coalition of public interest groups, in an effort to gain more 
diverse representation on the UC Board of Regents, will aUCmpt 
to block the regental appointment of San Diego attorney John G. 
Davies, whom they call "one more wealthy white guy." 

California Common Cause, the Latino Issues Forum and the 
UniversityofCaliforniaStudent Association (UCSA) have banded 
together to put a stop to the pattern of governors appointing 
conservative, affluent, white males who support them politically 
to the board. 

Members of the coalition argue that a homogeneous Board of 
Regents violates the state constitution, which requires that regents 
"shall be able persons broadly reflective of the economic, cultural 
and social diversity of the Slale, including ethnic minorities and 
women." 

"Davies represents the same economic class as the majority of 
the rest of the board.Il's too bad for him, but he's an example of 
the prOblem," said UCSA Executive Director Andy Shaw. 

Shaw said that having a Board of Regents with a membership 
such as it is now negatively impacts UC students in two ways. 
"Number one, they just don't understand the plight of today's 
students, especially the underrepresented. These people are just 
far removed from those realities," he said.

"Second, they have had a tendency to not lake actions when 
they probably should have because they don't want to hurt 'their' 
governor [that appointed them]." 

"We need someone who will stand up to the governor. John 
Davies is a friend of the governor - he's sure not going to

University Shuffles Jobs to Give More Time to RIMAe 
ADMINISTRAOON: University Events Director 
Lynne Peterson will handle co-op-A.S. negotiations 
By Francisco DeVries 
News Editor 

In a game of "musical offices," 
University Events Director Lynne 
Peterson has taken over Assistant 
Vice Chancellor Tom Tucker's re-
sponsibilities with \he Associated 
Students and the co-ops. 

The temporary move was de-
signed to give Tucker more time to 
oversee \he tw~year consbUCtion 
of the Recreational, Inuamural and 
Athletic Facility (RIMAC). He wiIJ 
retain his involvement in the Uni-
versity Center Board (UCB) and 
will continue to assist Peterson with 

theongoingco-op/ A.S. negotiations 
when necessary. 

Vice Chancellor for Undergradu-
ate Affairs Joseph Watson and As-
sociate Vice ChanceIJor for Under-
graduate Affairs A.W. Russ re-
quested the change, whichofficiaUy 
took place on Jan. 4. 

The "temporary adjustment" wiU 
give Tucker the time to work di-
rectly with the inspectors, contrac-
tors and principal users of the facil-
ity, according to Tucker and 
Peterson. He will also continue to 
work with the Student Affairs as-
pect of the legal actioo and the peti-

tion circulating to block the con-
struction of RIMAC and deassess 
its $210 a year fee. 

"[Tucker] is going to be spend-
ing a greaL deal of lime gelting 
RIMAC up and running," said 
Peterson. "I really think this is in the 
best interests of students [because 
RIMAC] must be done right" 

Doring the construction of the 
Price Center, Tucker and Univer· 
sity Center Director Jim Carruthers 
cooperated on a similar arrange-
ment to oversee planning, construc-
tion and outfitting of the student 
center. 

According to Watson the ar-
rangement was "very helpful and 
cost effective."

SEAC Spearheads New 
Paper Recycling Effort 
CAMPUS: After all paper recycling was halted last 
quarter, SEAC gets the VCB to approve new program 
By Lamlne Secka 
Associale News Editor 

After financial constraints led to 
the cancellation of UCSD's paper 
recycling program, the efforts of a 
fewdetcrmincdstudeOls havehelpcd 
bring campus recycling bins back. 

Sludenl Environmental Action 
Coalition (SEAC) member Michael 
Oshman took il upon himself to 
bring rccycling bins back 10 UCSD. 

Lasl year, there were a number 
of recycling bins located on campus 
tendcdby Bay Cities, the university 's 
garbage disposal company. 

Bay Cities was in fact dumping 
the recyclable inlO its landfills be-
cause of the poor markel for them. 
When confronled, they requcst.ed a 
S50 per month fcc to properly re-
cycle the malCrials. UniversilY offi-
cials refused to pay the fcc, and 
recycling was haIled. 

a shman and other SEAC mem-
bers started a petition al the begin-
ning of Fal I Quarter stating that they 
fell the admini lI"Jtion should ini-
Uateaserious recycling effort. They 
received 400-500 signatures on the 
petilion. 

ashman then presented thispeti-
tion to the University Center Board 
(UCB), which approved of having, 
at the very least, recycling bins avail-
able at the Old SWdent Cenler and 
the Price Center. 

In an allcmpltocounterthecosts, 
Oshman COntacled a long-di lance 
company, Excell Telecommunica-
tions, lO pay for the co l of recy-
cling. In relurn for signing people 
up for the phone company, SEAC 
would receive four percent of the 
bill payments made by those cus-
lomers. 

a shman spoke with Physical 
Plant Service (pPS), the depart-
ment with immediate control over 
on-campus recycling, to sec how it 
could help. 

According to acting Recycling 

Coordinator Susan Hawkinson, PPS 
doesn't have the means to under-
take a large recycling effon under 
the current financial situation. She 
said that the PPS budget for this year 
is the same as the budget in 1986-
87, despite a 40 percent increase in 
costs. 

"It's not PPS being the bad guy, 
lit'sl not UCSD, it's the real world 
in general," she said. 

However, efforts arc being made 
10 deal with both the budget and 
recycling problems. "his being rec-
ognized thatthcrc needs 10 be more 
recycling (on campusJ," Hawkinson 
said. "[lheuniversityJ has fonneda 
high-level cornmiuee 10 address the 
policy about recycling." 

Hawkinson said thauhere is noth-
ing in the Policy and Procedures 
Manual about recycling, and that 
there needs to be better planning 
because recycling is not a money-
making ventUfC. 

While 10ng-lCnn recycling plans 
arc not forthcoming, Hawk.inson 
said that PPS will still worlc to form 
programs at UCS D, adding that she 
applauds swdcnt groups who are 
working 10 bring recycling here to 
stay. 

Oshman eventually contacted 
Miramar Recycling and asked if it 
would be interested in a program at 
UCSD. 

According to Oshman, tJley not 
only said "yes," but offered to pay 
for the various recycled items. 
Miramar offered to pay $5 per ton 
for newspaper, $8()..S90 per ton for 
white paper and up to SI80 per ton 
for computer paper, Oshman said. 

A total of three bins were 10 be 
located in theoldstudcntcenter,one 
each for white paper, newspaper 
and a third, undetennined paper. 

In addition, there is to be a large 
newspaper bin located on Old 
Miramar Rd. at Regents Rd., and in

BUDGET: uc 
funding cut will spur 
further fee hikes 
Continued from pate 1 

The SI38 million cut in funding 
actuallytran lalCStoaS243 million 
shonfall from what the university 
needed juslto avoid further cuts or 
fee increases , according to Lassit.er. 

"We knew it was going to be a 
bad year ... [so] we're notswpriscd 
by the situation, (bIIt] we're disap-
pointed," said Lassiter aflCr the bud-
get was released. 

The budget crisis may actually 
worsen, howevCf. In the last three 
years the January budget figures 
turned out to be optimistic when the 
annual "May revisc" updalCS the 
budgel statistics a month before the 
dcadline for passage of a budget 
through the legislature. 

The governor's budget report did 
not spell out possible ways 10 deal

Oshman said. There are also plans 
to putbins near the Priee Center, and 
between the Snake Path and the 
Engineering building. 

a shman said that he was some-
what discouraged by the fact that 
people who arc paid to organize 
recycling programs likethis did very 
little, while all he nceded to do was 
pick up the phone. 

Oshman was pleased he was able 
to do something, but wished there 
was more that could be done. "I was 
bummed ... whatI wanted to do was 
a band-aid. I want [recycling] bins 
everywhere," Oshman said, adding 
that the lack of suppon from the 
administration and PPS made it dif-
ficultto achieve even small goals. 

Oshman predicts that the recy-
cling eHon on campus will grow in 
the near f uturc, and said that there 
will most likely be more recycling 
bins on campus soon.' 

"We don't want people to have 
to drive to recycle - that doesn't 
make scnse. We need to make it 
convenient in order for it to work," 
he said . 

with the budget cuts, as it usually 
does, but instead left the decisions 
up 10 the rcgents. 

However, the report did state 
that "the Governor is prepared to 
suppon any fee increase the Re-
gents may propose to hclpoffsct the 
$194 million shortfall." 

The governor's office used a 
complicated system to calculate its 
$194 million figure. It included tJle 
university's current base budget and 
then added S55 million 10 cover 
enrollment growth and salary in-
creases for faculty and staff. The 
total adjusted amount was then cut 
by 10 percent 

The university adminislmtion 
used a different calculation for its 
figures . 

Lassitcr said the shortfall would 
be covered with a combination of 
fee increases, layoffs and pay cuts. 
However, all three possibilities 
posed $ignificant problems. 

"[The university] is nearing the

point where we can't raise fees fur-
ther," and is already "well behind 
the competition" in faculty salary 
rates, he said. The Wliversity has 
am cut adm inisu-ative staff through-
OUt the university by 5,OCXl in the 
last two years. 

l...assit.er also said that the uni ver-
sity is not able to withstand these 
further cuts without cuuing seri-
ously into educational quality. "We 
are at the precipice now," he said. 

SlUdent Representative to the 
Board of Regents Alex Wong said 
that the budget cuts were both "hid-
eous [and] catastrophic," and called 
on students to protest the budget 
decision. "The message has to be 
sent," he added. 

V ice Chancellor for Undergradu-
ate Affairs Joseph Watson said that 
he is "deeply concemed" about the 
budget situation.

PINION 

All the memrers of the Association of Student Employees want is a little recognition 
By Andrew Wayne 
Contributing Opinion v.titer 

Nobody at UC 
Berkeley wants the 
strike to continue -
not gradualc studcnts, 
not faculty, not the 
administration and not 
undergraduates. It is 

thc UC systemwide admini tration, I ated 
on thc 22nd Ooor of the Kaiser building in 
Oakland. far removed from the Berkelcy 
campus, which provoked the trikc in the first 
placc and which refuse to allow a selliemenl. 
TIle syslemwide administration (lhc Office of 
Ihe President) appears willing to sacrifice a 
semester of educal ion for undergraduates as 
well as disrupt teaching and research 
activities of graduate sludents and faculty in 
an attempl to break the strike and destroy the 
A sociatiol1 of Graduate Student Employees 
(AGSE). Ihe Berkeley graduate student union. 

The Berkeley strike is about recognition. 
In 1989. a majority ofT As and RAs at 
Berkeley elected to be reprcscnted by a 
graduate student employee union. After a 

two~ay AGSE walkout. the Bcrkelcy 
admini lration granted AGSE interim 
reeognition and agreed to mcet in good failh 
to discus and resolvc issucs of graduate 
student employment. 

Over Ihe last thrcc years, AGSE has 
played a vital role protecting and improving 
graduate tudent teaching and research 
working condition . Gaining paid graduate 
tudent employee heallh insurance and 

enforcing limits on TA workload arc just two 
of its many accomplishments. Faculty. 
admini "[rator and undergraduate have all 
agreed Ihal AGS E has played a productive 
rolc in Ihe Berkeley campus conununity.

administration had overruled its authority to 
reach an agreemenL 

On Nov. 17, AGSE postponed its strike 48 
hours as a good faith gesrure in response to 
requests from state-elected officials and the 
UC President's offiee to allow time for a 
solution. On Nov. 19, with no resolution in 
sighl and the furure of the union at stake, 
graduate student employees elected to walk 
off the job. Seventy pereent of classes were 
completely shut down. thanks to undergradu-
ate and faculty support. 

The systemwide administration has 
claimed that they cannot legally recognize 
student employee unions. But three UC labor 
law professors have told UC officials that 
they arc wrong. Professor David Feller, an 
author of the relevant state law, has written 
the UC President that there is "no legal 
prohibition against [recognizing student 
employee unions]. That is a pure question of 
policy." 

AGSE will end its strike as soon as the 
university administration agrees to three 
reasonable demands: recognition of AGSE as 
the representative of its members; discussion 
of employment issucs in good faith; and 
payroll dues deduction. All three demands 
were met in the successful interim agreement 
which had been in place for three years. 
Moreover, before the systemwide administra-
tion stepped in, the Berkeley administration 
had been willing to renew their agreement to 
all threc demands. 

As 45 Berkeley faculty members said in an 
open lcUer to Chancellor Chang-Lin Tien on 
Dec. 7. HAGSE has becn exceptionally . 
flexible at Ihe negotiating table and has 
conceded everything bot its very existence."

I WAS A TEENAGE STRll(EBREAI(ER 
By J_on Snell 
COI1lribul;rvl Opinion ~Ier 

BERKELEY - When I crossed 
the picket line of UC Bcrk.eley's 
striking Graduate Student Instruc-
tors (GSls), I mumbled a sarcastic 
"Fight the power! " and kept right on 
walk ing to class. 

I' ll adrnit it: I was a UCBerkeley 
GSI, and I broke the strike. I also 
wearcJothes to ail my classes on the 
Cal campus. Call me a rebel. 

At UCBerkeley, though. "rebel" 
-would be far too kind a word. The 
tenn "scab" might be bandied about 
for someone like me, though I was 
just a worker who chose not to strike, 
rather than one who replaced strik-
ing workers. Since"scab"wouldn't 
do, I suggested to everyone that I 
simply be considered an "oppres-
sive bastard." It's simplcrthat way. 

As I crossed the picket line that 
day, I didn't know what kind of 
turnout I'd see in the class I was 
teaching. I was surprised by the 
large number of students - not 
right-wing puppets, but Communi-
caljon students - who braved the 
rain and came to class. 

The next day, the story in the 
papcrs was that 80 pereenLofall UC 
Berkeley classes were shut down . 
Thoscnumbers.ofcourse. were pro-
vidcd by UCB's Association of 
GraduateStudentEmployces-the 
strikers themselves. 

UCB classes kept right on going, 
with a few exceptions. Some classes 
moved off campus because of the 
strike, but they were still held. Final 
exams were held. Life marched on . 

Considering Berkeley's reputa-
tion as a left-wing city - this No-
vember, for example, saw a bitter 
election battle between a "liberal" 
City Council slate and a "leftist" 
City Counci 1 slate - it's surprising-

ASE: Graduate 
students fight for 
rights as employees 
Continued from pll&e 4 
of the strike. In their open leuer to 
the 
chancellor, they said, "We arc deeply 
concerned thal your administration 
gives the appearance of attempting to 
break AGSE 'sstrike and thus destroy 
the union rather than reach an agree-
ment. .. A failure to resolve the dis-
pute would be the worst possible out-
come .. . 

''The faculty, by a three-l<HlIle 
vote [in the academic senate) sent you 
on Nov. 24 an urunistakable message: 
we wanl an agreement with AGSE, 
and we want the systemwide admin-
istration to stop blocking such an 
agreement ... The facully is on record 
as stating that the relationship with 
AGSE over the past three years has 
been 'productive,' and that a seuJe-
ment with them 'will be in the best 
educational interests of undergradu-
ate and graduate students, and not 
detrimemal to faculty-student rela-
lions.' Graduate Division officials 
who ... deal closely with AGSE have 
attested to the rewards of this relation-

COMMENTARY: Picket lines, naked guys, oppression and hegemony - it's all in a 
day's work for a UC BerlreleyGrOOlJate Student Insnuctor 

thal support for the strike wasn't 
overwhelming. 

The fact is, graduale·students at 
UC Berkeley weren't strilcing for 
some great humanitarian cause. 
They were "fighting the power" for 
fun and profit. an attitude I k.now 
well from my days at UCSD. The 
poor, starving Graduate Student In-
structor at UC Berkeley makes over 
$1,200 every month for 20 hours a 
week of work. including in-class 
time. 

In addition, UC fee increases 
don 't aff eet them - they recei ve a 
fcediscount that rolls back their fees 
10 the levels of several years ago. 
They essentially get a $700 rebate 
(including free university health in-
surance) on top of their $ I 5 pcrhour 
salary. 

Union officials complained that 
since the univcrsity never officially 
recognized Ihem, studentemployec 
benefits could be taken away at any 
time. 11Iey argued that Ihese stu-
dents should be treatedjust lik.e other 
UC employees. 

This, of course, ignores the en-
tire concept of apprenticeship. De-
spitetheobsccncamountsofmoney 
that Graduate Student Instructors 
receive at UC Berkeley (second only 
to Harvard in Ihe entire country. and 
enough for me LO pay my UC fees, 
rent and then some), they're still al 
theuniversitytobesrudellls. They're 
learning, and one of the things 
they're learning is how to teach -
especially those students in Ph.D. 
programs who plan on being prof es-
sors one day. 

Being a Graduate Student In-
structor is a LOugh job. no doubt 
about it Even with the money I was 

ship and the sense of responsibility 
among AGSE leadership, and conse-
quently, bolh deans of the Graduate 
Division, as well as the Provost of the 
College ofLeuers and Science, voted 
for the resolution on Nov. 24. 

"Because we view an unresolved 
end to the strike as the worst possible 
resolution of !he conflict, we have 
reluctantly concluded that only fur-
ther pressure from a strong strike will 
induce the requisite flexibility from 
the administration. We coosider the 
university's negotiating position to 
be wveasonable and we are Wlwilling 
for our good relations wilh our stu-
dents to suffer because of this intran-
sigence." 

Here at UCSD, Teaching Assis-
tants and Research Assistants have 
also chosen to form a graduate stu-
dent employees union, called the As-
sociation of Student Employees 
(ASE). 

InJanuaryofl992,theASEmem-
bership voted to affiliate wilh District 
65/United Auto Workers to gain re-
sources and organizing experience. 
The ASE chose District 65/UA W

wants your opinion, they'll giveitto

for Bruce Herschensohn in 
November's election (he also voted 
for Bill Clinton) became known as a 
"fascist" around Ihe school of jour-

Now con cet me if I'm wrong, 
butlhe last time I checked. voting

Berkclcy is a Slate of mind. a 
place where far-out ideals are con-
s idered correct. The city' 5 
hegemonic ideas (I always knew 
my B.A. in Communication from 
UCSD would come in handy) have 
seeped into the minds of most 
Berkeleyans. Everyone assumes, 
even if Ihcy don ' t believe it Ihem-

fairness and progressive values. 
By Ihe end of last spring quarter, 

more Ihan 1.000 of Ihe I ,550 T As and 
RAs at UCSD hadjoincd the ASE. as 
verified by thc California Public

they will benelit from a union which 
can negotiate written agreements to 
prolCCland inlproveemployrnentcon-
ditions, a union wilh Ihe resources 
andmandale to ensure Ihat these agree-
ments are enforced. 

As at Berkeley, lhe issue for T As 
and RAs here is union recognition. 
The ASE del)1ands Ihatthe adminis-
tration respect the ASE's majority 
status and recognize Ihe ASE as a 
labor union. So far.lhe UCSD admin-
istration has refused to recognize Ihe 
ASE. This refusal expresses a clear 
disregard for the choice of more !han 
two-thirds of T As and RAs. 

The lesson to be learned from re-
cent events at Berkeley is that the UC 
systemwide administration, against 
the wishes of almost everyone atlhe 
local campus, is willing to step in and 
attempt to crush a graduate student 
employees union 

Undergraduates, faculty and 
graduate students, union membcrs and 
non-union members alike, are ap-

selves. that most of the people in 
Berkeley are on Ihe left 

But the Bcckeleyofthe '90sisall 
L1lk and no action. all revolutionary 
slogans and no revolution. People 
who have crossed the picket lines to 
come to class and save their grades 
will still feel free to chastise others 
for crossing those picket lines. The 
studcnt who walks around naked on 
the Cal campus is the ubjcct of 
jokes, not respect and approval for 
his unconventional way of lighting 
the power. The majority of people

dents. (Memo to publicity-hungry 
UCSD sludents: strip naked and 
dance around the Sun God if you 
want LO be in Newsweek.) 

The social revolts will continue 
at Bcrkcley. I'vc learned that if you

It's the way of '90s Berkeley. I 
support the strikers, because sup-
porting organi7..ed labor is the Ihing 
to do. The administration is an op-
pressor, treating its sLUdents as

palled that the systemwi'de adminis-
tration has no qualms about sacrific-
ing undergraduate education as well 
as campus harmony to pursue its ideo-
logical ends. Perhaps when Berkeley 
returns from its winter break, Ihe 
systemwide administration will lis-
ten to the wishes of thc Bcrkeley 
community. 

There is an even more important 
lesson to be learned from Berkeley. 
Once Ihe AS E has gained recognition 
at UCSD. it will have an important 
and productive role as the representa-
tive of graduate students' work-rc-
laled concerns to Ihe administration. 
The experience of Ihe past three years 
at Berkeley has shown that when 
graduate student employees and ad-
ministrators arc willing to sit down 
and discuss employment concems in 
good failh, much can be accomplishcd. 

Protecting and improving T A and 
RA working conditions means beuer 
Ufldergraduate education and a higher 
caliber of teaching and research. And 
as long as graduate students have 
chosen wlion representation, the AS E 
will continue its fight for recognition.

MORE DEBATE ON THE BIBLE AND HOMOSEXUALITY 
Editor: 

I am writing in response to Lyngine 
Calizo's ICLlcr ("Thc Biblc Was Mis-
represented In Letter," Nov. 30). In 
this leLler she Slated that she was "an-
gered, disgusted and sickcned by 
[Michelle Persaud'sl misuse and mis-
interpretation of the Bible to justify 
her prejudices and blatant 
homophobia." I am neither angered 
nordi gusted by Calizo's leuer, but I 
believc that she should have another 
look at her Bible. Specifically, she 
should read Genesis 13: 13 ("But the 
men of Sodom were wicked ... "), 
18:20(" ... their sin is very grievous"), 
19:24 ('Then the Lord rained upon 
Sodom and upon Gomorrah brim-
stone and fire .. .'), Leviticus 18:22 
("Thou shalt not lie with manldnd, as 
with womankind: it is abomination'), 
20: 13 ('If a man also lie with man-
Idod, as he lieth with a woman. both 
of them have committed an abomina-
tion: Ihey shall surely be put to 
death; .. .'), Isaiah 3:9 ( ..... and they 
declare their as Sodom, they hide il 
not. Woe unto their soul! for they 
have rewarded evil unto them-
selves. '), Romans 1:27 (" ... the men. 
leaving the natural use of the woman. 
burned in their lust one toward an-
other ... '), I Corinthians 6:9, 10 ("Be 
not deceived: neither fornicators, nor 
idolators, nor effeminate, nor abusers 
of themselves with manldnd. Nor 
thieves ... shall inherit the kingdom of 
God.'),andJude 1:7("EvenasSodom 
and Gomorrah ... going after strange 
flesh, are set forth for an example, 
suffering the vengeance of eternal 
nrc'). 

Thc.<;e are all references to the sin 
of sodomy. It is a sin listed amon~ 

fornication, idol worship and theft, a 
clear indication of God's stand on the 
matter. The fate of homosexuals is 
clear, unless liley repent of their sins, 
overcome the challenge which God 
has given to them, and change their 
lives for the better. The Bible leaves 
no room for interpretation. 

Inhcrleuer, CaJizo wTOte about "a 
God who loves uncondi tionally. "That 
is true, God does love uncondition-
ally. But His mercy is not so great that 
Hc will look the other way when His 
laws are broken. He is not only a 
loving God, but also a just God who 
demands that when His laws arc bro-
ken. justice is fulfilled. His love and 
mercy are shown through the gift of 
repentance and the atonement of Jesus 
Christ, through which he paid the 
price of sin for us . 

We, as Christians, should love the 
sinner, but we should alsahate the sin. 
That does not mean that we should 
accept homosexuality. There is no 
footnote in the Bible that says "But 
after the year 1985 shall sodomy no 
longer be a sin, for God is Politically 
Correct." His laws which were in 
place when Sodom and Gomorrah 
were destroyed are still true today.

Hail to the Celtics 
Editor: 

I am a Bostonian and was a visit-
ing scholar last quarter at IRPS. As a 
Ce1tics fan since well before the Larry 
Bird era, I was struck by Gregory 
Stephens' column "The Last of the 
Great White Hopes" (Nov. 30). !agree 
with vinually all his points, but I am 
afraid that he may have rnissed a few 

associaled 

winler '93 

of the most important aspects of the 
argwnent about Celtic racism 

First, Red Auerbach was not only 
the f II'St coach (and thus, Boston the 
fll'St franchise) 10 stan five blacks, he 
was also the coach when Boston 
drafted and played the fltSt black: in 
the NBA. Second, the Celtics were 
also the flISl team to have a black 
coach (Bill Russell), the fITS! to have 
had two black coaches (Satch Sand-
ers) and the only team to have had 
threc black coaches (withK.C. Jones). 

Third, the Celtics are the only 
team so far to reverse the racial ste-
reotype that blacks can run and jump 
but whites can think. By having K.C. 
Jones coach three white starters (Bird, 
Kevin McHale and Danny Ainge), 
Boston demonstrated that it was pos-
sible to have a black man tell white 
athletes what 10 do and how to play. 

Fourth, you alluded 10 theconven-
tional wisdom that Bird was not an 
exceptionally gifted athlete. That has 
certainly been the case in recent years, 
bul if you got some videos of Bird 
when he was young, you would see 
that he was a leaper with the best of 
them. white or black. 

Of course, what separated Bird 
from merely good players was his 
court sense and brains, but he was 
also a top athlete by any standard. 
Conversely, what made Magic great 
was not his enormous physical talent, 
but his intelligence. 

The "Bird can't jump, so he had to 
outsmart them" way of thinking is at 
best unconscious racism, implying 
that black stars get there on ra w talent 
while white stars get there on hard 
work and intelligence.

REGENT: "Just 
another wealthy guy" 
criticized by group 
Cont inued from pat. 1 
challenge Governor Wilson," said 
Guillenno Rodriguez, director of 
research and policy for the Latino 
Is ue Forum. 

"Our opposition to Davies has 
nothing todowith him as a person," 
empha ized California Common 
Cause Po licy ' Analyst Kim 
Alexander. "Our desire is that ap-
pointments are made on someone's 
expertise and background." 

Davies would not respond to in-
quires regarding the oppo ition to 
his appoinunent. 

Alexander said the coalition is 
currently lobbying state legislators 
and plans to testify at D'.lvies' con-
flfmation hearings. 

Following the retirement of Re-
gent Yori Wada last March, Gover-
nor Pete Wilson appointed Davies, 
58,to a l2-year seaton the board. 
Theappointrnentmust beconf Inned 
by the State Senate within one year, 
during which time D'.lvies is allowed 
to be a voting member of the board. 
The Senate Rules Committee will 
hold a hearing on Davies appoint-
ment late this month or in early 
February . 

Wilson's choice of Davies im-
mediately came under fire, both for 
the lack of diversity, and for Davies' 
personal ties to Wilson. 

Davies and Wilson have been 
friends since attending law school 
together at UC Berkeley in 1961 . In 
addition, Davies is the overseer of 
the governor's personal blind trust, 
and he has contributed $39,000 

Wilson' political campaigns in the 
last three years. 

In Man:h, Chainnan of the Sen-
ate Rules Committee David Roberti 
advised Wilson in a letter that, al-
though Davies "appears 10 be a com-
petent and qualified person," he 
questioned the appointment because 
"thecompositionoftheregenlSdocs 
not adequately reflect a cross-sec-
tion of California's diverse popula-
tion .. . The appointment of Davies 
will add another white male making 
20 of our 30 regents white males." 

Some members of the Board of 
Regents, including Wada and 
Jeremiah Hallisey, also questioned 
Davies' appointment when it was 
announced. "It seems to me that 
Governor Wilson and Mr. Davies 
have been friends for a long time," 
said outgoing Regent Wada at the 
time. "I had hoped that [Wilson] 
would appoint a Chinese-American 
for this position." 

However, others supported 
Davies. "I know and respect John 
Davies," said Regent Roy Brophy. 
"[Wilson'sl flfSt appointment went 
to an Asian-A merican, S teve 
Nakashima, and John Davies is his 
second one and I welcome both of 
them." Student Regent Alex Wong, 
a law student atUC Berkeley, ex-
pressed mixed feelings about the 
coalition's desire to block Davies' 
appointment. 

"Do I think it would be bcuer if 
the board were more diverse? Yes. 
But the way you change member-
ship is not to single out an indi-
vidual," Wong said Friday. He added 
that refonn could be better accom-
plished by creating specific criteria 
for the membershipofthe UC Board 
of Regents, aimed at instituting di-

vcrsity and removing political in-
fluences. 

Wong said that Davies had been 
relatively quiet as a voting member 
of the board, which iscommon fora 
new regent, and that, while he had 
not talIced to Davies about specinc 
lUclent or ethnic issues. "I haven't 

felt that he's ignored where I come 
from." 

He pointed out that Davies' vote 
againstincrcasingchancellors'sala-
ries last spring was crucial to defeat-
ing the proposal. Wong said he saw 
this vote as a positive sign, saying 
"[Davies) has done something that 
very few regents have done.11lat is, 
stand up and say 'no ... ' 

"If I were John Davies, which 
I'm nOl, I would be feeling resentful 
because I've been putting in my 
time and working hard, but because 
of my race, age and my money, 
because of things I have very liLLIe 10 
do with, I'm being denied," Wong 
said. 

He suggested that, because of 
the public uproar over former UC 
President David Gardner's pension 
package, Davies may become a vic-
tim of unfortunate timing. "Because 
of the recent scandle," Wong said, 
"people are just looking for ways to 
slap the university. Thesharks smell 
blood "California Common Causes' 
Alexander agreed that the contro-
versy over Gardner's $2.4 million 
pension package at a time when UC 
is strapped for funding, whieh 
Daviessupponed,creates an oppor-
tunity to further her group's cause. 

However, she said thal the inci -
dent just demonstrated to the public 
the "lack of sensitivity" and lack of 
accountability that exists among the 
regents.

BUDGET: 
Proposed cuts may 
devastate UC 
Continued from paee 3 
he said. "It is clear . . . malthere will 
be elimination of certain progmms 
and facilities." 

Associated SlUdents Vice Presi-
dent External Colin Wilson was 
worried about the damage such cuts 
will have on the already SlrelChed 
univtnity. "In fOU'yearswe'vegooe 
from having one of the best, most 
affordable institutions. . . to the 
worsL" 

There is a rally planned forThurs-
day at noon at the Hump in front of 
the Main Gym 10 protest the budget. 

Wilson joined Wong in calling 
on students 10 prOlestthe proposed 
budgeL "Only highcr education is 
getting these kinds of cuts . ... Power 
is a very simple thing. You either 
build it, devclopit [andl use it or you 
suffer." 

The goal of the administration is 
to minimizcthe impact on the class-
room ,according to Watson, but''Lhe 
quality of some services must go 
down." 

Watson said that his office is 
"asking all deparunenLS and pro-
grams 10 devise plans for a 10 per-
cent cut [in the budgetl." 

The most important thing for the 
university to do is 10 remain acces-
sible 10 eligible students, according 
to Watson. The worst move the uni-
versity could make would be to re-
duce enrollment, he added. 

One of the most pressing con-
cerns of both Watson and Lassiter 
was sludent's access 10 financial 
aid. There was no increase in fund-
ing 10 the Cal Grant program in the 
~overnor's budgetlo cover the fee 
Increases . 

L3.ssiter said the fee increases 
and funding cuts are resulting in 
"more and more loans and less in 
less in !enns of grants." 

While Lassiter maintained that 
some people still perceive the uni-
versity as a bargain, "we are of the 
opinion that fees have risen too 
quickly." 

Watson cited financial aid as one 
of the most important issues of the 
budgctcrisis because such aid is key 
10 keeping thc university accessible 
to all eligible students. "It is critical -
that Cal Grants be fully funded," he 
said. 

Watson criticized thc proposed 
budgct for increasing funding 10 the 
Dcpanrnem of Corrections while 
cutting education. "We should be 
investing the other way . .. mat is 
very dislUrbing," he said. 

Wilson was fairly pessimistic 
about thc f ulure of financial aid. 
"We will be loolcing al figures at the 
end of this budget cycle mat will 
eliminate everything financial aid 
was meant to do," he said. 

Watson said that when more de· 
tailed budget figures become avail-
able the administration wilJ work 
closely with the Registration Fee 
Committee, the A.S. and the Gradu-
ate Student Association (GSA) be· 
fore deciding on how the university 
will dcal with the funding cuts. 

The $51.2·billion slale budget 
also includes an enonnous $2.6 bil-
lion cut to local governments and 
shiCtsthal money 10 the publ ic school 
system. Even with that shift, public 
schools were OOlgivenany increase 
in funding 10 cover inflation. 

The California Slate University 
system suffered cuts similar 10 the 
UC system, bulbecausc stateschools 
receive 80 percent of their funding 
from thestalC,compared 10 UC' 26 

'-____________________ .... percent, the impact is greater.

UCSD qualifies 12 
for NCAA meet at 
SpeedoCup 
Continued "om pate 16 

But the highlight of the season 
came at December's Spccdo Colle-
giate Cup in Long Beach. ''The Cup 
was what we were pointing for during 
the first quancr," the coach said. 

Boyd had both of his teams point-
ing in thc right direction. Six Tritons 
made the times required for an auto-
matic berth at thc NCAA meet, and 
six more wcre fast cnough to condi-
tionally qualify. 

Ontheworren'sside,JamieCouch 
was an "A" qualifier, taking the 50-
yard freestyle in 24.4, while Carrie 
Parker was another automatic quali-
fier, sctling a UCSD freshman record 
in the 200-yard backstroke with a 
2:09.9 limC. "[ Parkcrl had the swim 
of the meet for us," Boyd said. 

"B" qualifiers for thc UCSD 
women included Allison DUM in thc 
200-yard breaststroke, Dustin Mat-
thew in the I OO-and 200-yard breast-
strokes and COlmie Romero in the 
IOO-yard freestyle. Jocelyn Rothbard 
was a triplc-<jualifier for the Tritons 
in the 50-, 100- and 200-yard 
f recstyles. 

Thc men's tcam had four auto-
matic qualifiers, including Miller, who 
had an enormous meet. qualifying in 

8.5 X 11 • 201 white 
autofeed or self serve 

fiveevcrus while breaking ooeNCAA 
record in addition to a UCSD mark. 
The national record came with a time 
of I :49.0 in the ~yard backstroke, 
and he broke a UCSD record in the 
lOO-yard back with a 51.25. Miller 
also was an automatic qualifier in the 
5OO-yard frcc, the 200-yard 1M and 
the lOO-yard fly. 

John Flowers was another record-
breaker for the Tritons, finishing the 
50·yard frcc in 20.5 to shatter the old 
mark. Flowers also was a qualifier in 
the 1000yard free with a time of 46.0. 

Gabe Speyer, also in the 50-yard 
frcestyle, was another aUlOmatic 
qualifier with a ftnish of 20. 7, as was 
TaylorSpangler whotouchcd the wall 
at 58.2 in the lOO-yard breaststrokc. 
Spangler's, Speyer's and Flower's 
50-yard free wcrc aI I personal records. 

Conditional qualifiers for the men 
included freshman Andy Hollywood. 
who recorded yet anolher UCSD per-
sonal record, finishing the lOO-yard 
backstroke in 52.3. McNeIT was a 
"B"qualifier in threeevents,the500-
and 2OO-yard frccstyles. McNeff also 
qualified in the 200-yard backstroke 
with a mark of 1:55. 

The Spccdo Cup was the high-
light of thcscason so far for UCSD. "I 
was shocked at how we)) we swam," 
Boyd said. The coach sees his team, 
especially the men, in good shape for 
showdowns with Kenyon College, 
both at their upcoming dual meet and 
at thc NCAA's. "This men's team i 
one of the best UCSD has ever sent to 
the championships," Boyd aid.

To gel to the champiooship, the 

Tritons improved their record to 7 -<i 00 
the season with a 105~ harruncring of 
Havcrlord College on Friday. 

UCSD got started in a huny, with 
Chris Mom:'s jumper from the right 
comer giving the Tritoos a 6-0 lead just 

aminuteandahalfintothecoot~l Five 
minutes later, Brad Halte came up with 
a slellardcfensiveplay wren he blocked 
a shot, then leaped to save the ball from 
goingootofbounds. Poilu guard R<Xlocy 
Lusain took the ball and slarlCd up the 
court before fmding John Spcoce under 
the hoop. Spence's layup gave the Tri-
toos a 10 poilu lead at 22-12 

From that poilu 00, the Fools pcm1 
no problerTl'l to the T ritoos, and the half 
eroed with the Tritoos up 51-32 

Moore, who scored 36 points 
Wednesday at Redlands, showed no 

signs of slowing down, gamcring 18 in 
the first half. 

The secood half was much of the 
same for the Tritons. They were able to 
runthebaU wilOOulmuch troublcagainst 
the slower Haverford team "We were 
TUMing, which is saret.hing I koow I 
like to do," Spence said "It lets us use 
our athleticism"

"At halftime I 1OOugh! I wwld cool off,

The Tritoos started the secm1 half 
the same way they enIed it with Moore

An Old Fashioned 
Butt Whippin' 

AM then. all of a sudden. I remem-
bered why I am such a big 4gers fan. 

I'll start with Saturday night AOOut 
300 aher basketball fans and I came 10 
watch the TrilOOS lake 00 sane randall 
team frem New Jersey in the fUlaI game 
of the annual La Jolla Classic. 

This team, I think it was the Profs or 
SOOlClhing, was ranked amoog the top 10 
in the natioo am had a~lutely 
decimated the hapless Pomona-Pi!7.er 

Sag~1S the night before. 
At any rate, they were bi g and slfOng. 

NO( at all a good team to go up against 
when yoo 're struggl ing. 

S<rrewhal surprisingly, the TrilOOS 
jumped out to an early lead and led fer 
IIDSt of the game. But as the game 
wourd down, the Ic3d faltered, then fell. 
It cam.! down to the r mal sccoods. 

The stage was sel 'll1e time was ri pc. 
The erowd roared as well as 300 people 
can roar. I was on my feet. 

Twenly sccoods remained, UCSD 
was down by two am we had the b:lIl. 
EveryollC in the place \cncw that Ouis 
Mocre was going to lake the flllal shoL 

I guess the Profs kncw t ,because 
they had about three of the biggest 
Division m players you have ever seen 
standing aroW'd hin1. But, no malter, the 
shol would fall. It was inlhe cards. 
When you're a 49cn; fan everything is 
always in the cards, the shO( always falls. 

Moore took the pass, he tWlxx:l, he 
shot. .. Ire missed. NO( rcaUy his faul~ he 
was well defcn:led anl falling away, but 
the point remains: Joe would not have 
missal. For the 49crs it is always in the 
cards. That is why il is ~'UCh great fun to 
be a 4gers fan. 

It docsn't even matler that the 49crs 
are a f ooM team, they can do anything. 

I was rcmirrlcd of this fact just 
yestcroay wlx:n I watched the OIargers 
get pummeled by the Dolphins. 

Th: Chargers had bcal easy to igoore 
until this year. They I~ most of the time 
am no one really cared. least of all me. 
In fact, the only tirre I took interest was 
when I entered one of those radio 
contests that gave a prize to the lucky 
listener who com:ctly picked wlx:n 
Bobby Ross was going to get fired 

But wouldn't you know il, I kirx!a' 
started to like the lillJe guys tins year. 
They were looIdng good when they had 
alrolutely no right to. A oock-up 
quarterback leading a team wi lh one 
good receiver and a 10( of spunk. Their 
defense actually looked good and I 
started to look f<IWard to the 4ge:rs 
getting to polll\:l the OIargers in lhe 
Super Bowl. 

Okay, I admil that I lel myself get 
swept up in lhe Chargers marlia that 
swept the town over the lasl few weeks, 
am I may actually be lx:coming a fan. 
but now I remember why being a fan of 
other teams, 110 maUer what ~')X>n, is such 
a pain: It's tIlis whole losing busiress.

Jim McLeod was the standout for the 
Tritons, picking up a goal and two ltiSislS 
to help out winning goalie Mike Teperson. 

Mcleod frred in UCSD's fusl goal, a 
shorthanded score that the forward SIDle 
from a Cal Tech defenseman. McLeod 
broke away with the puck and skated in by 
himself to pick up the score. 

Eric Ranheim nOLChed UCSD'ssccond 
goal, also a shonhanded score. McLeod 
then gOl eredit for assists on the final two 
UCSD goals on shots by Chris Johnson 
and Leigh Hsu. 

Cal Tech's score came on a two-man 
advantage. Other than thaI goal, the Bea-
vers had problems with UCSD's offense, 
even when the Tritons were a man down. 

"Our transition game was really work-
ing for us," Johnson said. "We had a lot of 
t wo-on -ones and brcakaways and they just 
couldn't keep up with us. They were able 
to cut ofT our passes on the two-on-ones, 
but we just started shooting the puck in-

Student Doub/e Rgentlnfi/trates ue Politics 
Interview: One of the 
most important students in 
the UC system ,Alex Wong 
sits on the notoriously 
powerful BoardofRegents 

Alex Wong, a fonner Third College student 
and ASUCSD vice president administrative, 
holds a one-year term on the Board of Regents, 
the body that controls all nine UC campuses. 
Now a law student al UC Berkeley, Wong tries 
to bring the students' perspectives to the board 
of mostly older professionals. 
WhIIt .. the best ..cI wont p..-ts of 
Mine .... studHt ,.,..u 

The best pan is having an opportunity 10 
impact the entire enchilada, if you will. [ have 
had the opportunity 10 sit for a year and a half on 
the Board of Regents for the largest, in theory 

besl, perhaps most famous uni-
versity system in the world, and 
for that brief amount of time [ 
have had the chance 10 cham-
pion whatever issues I think are 
important For someone who 
wants to get into public policy, 
for someone who wants 101Iy 10 
make a difference, it's an amaz-
ingopportunityandexperience. 

The down side is I spend 
belwren40 and 50 hours a week, 
which has a tremendous impact 
00 social life and more or less 
imponalllly 00 academic life. 
There is an old saying I have 
which is, don 'I do il for 
'popularity's sake, because 
you'll either piss off the stu-
dents and the regents will love 
you or you'll piss off the regents 
and the students will love you. 
Or if you're really good you'll 
piss off bolh the students and

board when

lhe regents, and if you do the 
laller. which Ilhink: is where I'm 
at. then I lhink: you're doing a 
good job. 

Bul there are no righl an-
swers. It's easy to say, "Don't 
raise fees," for example. It's 
much harder to say here's where 
the money's going to come from. 
It's really hard 10 decide what 
decisions to make when your 
owngulistom50-50. There's a 
lot of pressure. There are a 10( of 
students who really want you to 
go to the mat for them. and you 
have a lot of regents who say, 
"Look al the big piclure. This is 
just nol possible." 

And you've gOI to weigh the 
lwo. You have to stand up for 
students, bul you have to recog-
nize the constraints of reality. 
You have 10 explain to students, 
hey, these are great ideas, bul 

just plain reality demands that cenain elements 
justcan't work. Youhaveloexplain to the board 
that tIlis may seem cut-and-dried in terms of 
statistics, butlhis is really whal is happening out 
there. 

This is what students are feeling. There's a 
sense of betrayal or hun or anger or whatever, 
and you just can't ignore that. If you're really 
lucky, you gel both sides to listen, and if you 
take one wrong step, both sides run over you 
with a stcarrlfOller. All in all, I'm loving the 
experience. I was expecting the steamroller. [ 
knew il was corning. It's hit me a couple of 
times, and I'm stiD standing. 
WMt does • student .... _ do? 

The student regent, lechnically, is a regent 
just like every other member, so in that sense he 
or she has the same duties and responsibilities 
and voting power as any other regent, which is 
overseeing the policy making of the University 
of California. [It] is a Wlique position in many 
ways. The facI [is] thaI they are students with

different background, they are living in a different wCKld than most 
students live in. This is true. 

The second assumptioo then is that they don't give I damn what 
theslUdents are going through. (have talked with a Iotoflhesepeople, 

think tOO board is anti-sruden! per se, 
What I can say is I think a 101 of board members are not in our

raise X nurnberofdollars,and here is how we can do it with srudent 
fees. They are not lumped together in a sort of big budget picture 
which is, here is what a 10 percent fcc increase will do, here's what 
a live percent increase will do, here's what a zero perccnt increase 
will do. 

None of these arc necessarily good ideas. In fact, none of these 
are necessarily solutions. But if you put the a.ltcrnatives on the Lable, 

SPECTACLE S3 

that will work. but it's one step. But the key in the long run is a diITerenl 
state budget where the whole system works. Unti l that hapI>Cm, we're 
serewed. 

In the short run, it's trying to balance the lesser of tOO two evils to 
frnd out what combination of fee increases, cuts, salary culS, program 
cuts or whatevcr are needed to balance the budget year by year, none 
of which is desirable. 
You spoke of your impact on the BOMI of Regent .. How" 
do you think your impact really is? 

I don ' tthink tOO difference between the student regent and other 
regents is one of formality or one that is differentiated in tenns of 
their world. It really is what the student regent chooses to do with 
it. There is a lot of room for individual interpretation. 

The student regent is unique in the sense thaI, although techni-
cally a trustee to the state of Cali fomi a and not an elected member, 
the reason you have a student regent is to bring the perspective and 
view of the rudenlS. And there is a real fine tightrope that you have 
to walk because you arc not there simply to be an advocate for 
students; you havetobe awarcofthe big picture. You have to follow 
your mandate of looIOng afLCr the best interests of the university. 

regents are sitting there saying, 'Let's screw the students again. '" I think that really varies is uetoissue. There's one area where i took a really aggress i ve stand, and that was the i sue of di IT erenti alf ccs. And I've worked with student governments on all nine campuses, and I 
lobbied each of the regents, I mailed out packages, I lobbied the 
president and we were able to kill differential fees. That docsn 't mean 
it's gone forever. It's being reconsidered and may surfaec again. But 
what was in theory inevitable was actually stopped and removed from 
thc agenda. I think that was impact 

On the other hand, you have to recognize that the reason you are 
there is to convey what the tudents arc going through, what the 
experiences in the trenches are, because I think the one area of 
expel1ise that a student has that no regent or administrator can hope 
to have is simply being there, being a student, knowing what it's 
like. Being able to say, these statistics may be great, but I know how 
long it takes to get a financial aid check, or I know how long the lines 
are, or how hard it is LO get a class, or how well it works. 

So if the question is what are the duties, the duties are the same, 
and tOO differences arc what the student regent chooses to do with 
it. I think a student regent who will be effective is one who goes in 
with an agenda, is aware of what the student sentiment is, takes a 
proactive role in informing the board of what i affecting srudenlS, 
what their concerns are, as well as taking a very active role in being 
a full -nedged regent, in becoming knowledgeable in areas that may 
not be of direct i.nterest to students, of showing up to all the 
meetings, of advocating for issues that are of importance and 
listening to ones that he or she may not know a lot abouL Don't be 
a single-is ue person. So that's son of it in a nutshell. 
You said that the student regent has to walk I tightrope 
between the students end the regents. How would you 
ch .. ac:terize your relationship with the other re,ents? 

At the moment I would say overall it's pretty good I think I have 
thercspcct of many of the board. I know due to cenain positions ] 've 
lakcn and some aggressive stands I've laken I have angered some 
regents, and although not desirah1e, sometimes that is inevitable. I 
have found that no regent has treated me with hostilityyeL And I've 

• 

I speak, some listen, and I fecI I've been able to have an impact in 
the pasL I hope that for the remaining months on the board I'll still 
be able to have some impact. 
You uicI that some ~e stands )'OU Jurye liken 
have ...,erect the ,.,ents. What ~e stands 
have you taken? 

The first thing I was talking about is that the Board of Regents 
should become a more proactive board. not a reactive board with 
regard to state budget, and that we should lake a more aggressive 
stand and not say, "God, it's a bad budget year, how do we cut our 
losse ?" because there's no way to cut our losses. 

We're losing far too much, and we should be out there aggres-
sively saying both publicly and through lobbying that the Univcr-
ity of California is one ofthc most essential clements of the state 

ofCalifomia, and iL is in dire jeopardy at the momenL We need to 
do things like say, how can we help in the state budget crisis? How 
can we take a proacti ve role and address sonne of these things that 
are affecting us in terms of budget CUIS? 
With all the fee incr .... a lot of students Jurye a very 
negative perspective of the regents and believe they're 
out to ,et the students. Do you find that to view to be 
valid? 

I don'L r honestly don't believe the regents arc sitting there 
saying, "Ah, let's screw the studcnlS again." TIlere are some facts 
we have to establish as true and then some as umptions we have to 
step away from. The fact is that most of the Board of Regents arc 
very wealthy, predominantly white, predominantly male, predomi-
nanlly Republican, predominantly older. 

So initially the student will take a look at this groupofpcoplc and 
begin by saying, "Well, what docs this group of people have in 
cornmon with us? How can they possibly understand where we're 
at?" And I think this is the facl They arc differem, they are from a

there is a shared fccling that there is a real desire not to raise fees. A1 probably even give you the Price Club clicker number.

no, I don't Mich. Croll/Guam/an a question 

r think the board can make a belter decision and say, OK, if our 
choices arc between pay cuts for these groups of people or fec 
increases here, or cu uing back rope on this campus there, or doing 
this or that, we. can probably find a better solution than saying, OK 
we need this amount of money and student fees are the way to do 
iL 

And that is something I am bringing before the board, and I think 
we may sec some changes in how this information is prescnted to 
the board so they can make, hopefully, morc informed decisions. 
. My problem is, even with all of these things laid on the table, 
none of the alternatives are pleasant, sowhatever happens, fees are 
still going to go up at some level. I don't know how much. I'm a 
student here, you know, but there's no way that I can see not having 
fee increases. I am completely opposed to them. 

I just don't sec a way to get around thcm, especially with the 
budget crisis the state is facing, and I'm confident that the governor 
again will slash our budgct. Therc's just too little money and too 
much demand. 
Do )'ou.see fees rising more next ye. than the $600 
Increase already passed? 

Almostdefinitely.1 will fight against itin any way Ican, and the 
only way I will have a chance of slOpping thefec increase is if! can 
show an alternative source of money that is viable and legitimate. 
I carmotchangethe fact - nobody can change lhe fact -tllat we'rc 
a $9 billion dollar instiruLion and thc UC is just damned expensive. 

We also carmOl change the fact that the state legislature and 
govemor are really strapped and are cutting everywhere they can. 
I right now am trying to work with the University of Cal ifomi a 
Student Association, the Alumni Association and the university to 
form a coalition to fight the legislature and the govemor, to go forth 
and say please don't cut our budget, to merge into a unified from as 
opposed to the divisive ones we've had in the past. I don 't know if 

I didn't do it alone. In fact, the only reason it happened was because 
enough students expressed their concern and enough regents listened. 
I simply acted as a conduit to try to get srudenlS to channel their cfforts. 
We had something like 12 or 13 resolutions passed by student 
govemment. UCSD is a prime example. Under the Icadership of 
[UCSD A.S. President] Mike Holmes and the graduate student presi-
dent, [we] PUL together some very strongly-worded resolutions. 

All of a sudden I'm not one person talking. I'm saying look, here 
is the undergraduate population oruc San Diego saying don't do this. 
Here's the graduate population saying don't do this. That's a powerful 
message, and I corrunend ule regents for listening. I commend the 
presidcnt for withdrawing the item aft.cr hearing al\ the debate. 

So 1 think there' impact, yet I wiU never have thc inlpact of forcing 
an issue. 0 studcnt regent wi II ever have the power or the clout or the 
authority todo so. Butlif it's] done right, and ifit's a legitimate issue, 
and if the studenL~ back it with enough support, you can send a message 
and a decent Board of Regents will hopefully hear it. 

That is the single issue I have had the mo t impact on, recognizing 
that there arc hundreds of things going before the board. One thing 
probably took one to two hwldred hours of work, lobbying each 
campus and compiling stulT and calling each regenl It takes a lot of 
effort to do, but you pick your battles. 

Student Regent Alex Wong, who has six months left in his 
term, will be available to answer questions in the UCSD A.S. 
offices on the third floor uf the Price Center today at 1:30 p.m. 

Wong asks any students with concerns relating either to 
campus issues or the regents to call him at (510) 475-0977.
