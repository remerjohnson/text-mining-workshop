ASUCLA FGrced to Lay 
Off 20 EmpIoy_ 
LOS ANGELES - Despite 
continued efforts to cut costs 
and boost sales, a persistant 
slide in revenue and a projected 
$1.6 million budget shortfall for 
the 1992-93 year is forcing 
UCLA's student association, 
the Associated Students UCLA, 
to layoff 20 career employees. 
The ASUCLA draws its income 
from about 30 campus stores, 
eateries and student services. 
Along with the layoffs, a hiring 
freeze and a five percent across-
the-board cut to career staff 
salaries will be implemented in 
order to slice $1.7 million from 
next year's budget. The 
continuing recession, declining 
tourism as a result of the L.A. 
riots last spring and massive 
campus construction restricting 
parking for tour buses were 
among the causes cited for the 
drop in revenue. 

UCSB May Lose 
Ov_l00C ...... 
SANTA BARBARA - A 
$2.6 million cut may force the 
UCSB College of Leners and 
Sciences to cut more than 100 
classes next year. The college, 
which enrolls 94 percent of the 
undergraduate students and 
64% of the graduate students at 
UCSB, has already absorbed Â· 
cuts of $500,000 and $1 .5 
million in the last two years. 
College of Leners and Sciences 
Provost L1ad Phillips said the 
campus' best estimate for total 
funding reductions in 1993-94 
is about $9.8 million. 

ASUCD Seeks to 
Tap Building Fund 
DA VIS - The ASUCD 
Executive Council passed a 
resolution urging UC Davis 
administrators to use an existing 
building fund for student 
services next year. The resolu-
tion seeks to take money from 
the $60 million fund set aside 
for the construction of a 
performing arts center to avoid 
the cuts to services outlined in 
Davis' proposed budget.

UC Executive To Receive One 
Year's Pay After Retirement 
By Chris Jensen 
Associate News Editor 
and KlmI Yoshino 
California Aggie 

UC President Jack Peltason revealed last 
week that retiring Vice President Ronald Brady, 
the architect of the controversial payment pack-
ages for top UC executives, will be paid an entire 
year's salary after he leaves his post July I. 

Peltason announced that former UC Presi-
dent David Gardner secretly agreed to the 
$181 ,640 payment before he left office last year. 
Brady, who served as Gardner's senior vice 
president, was also one of the key figures behind 

TIMBER 

Gardner's $2.4 million retirement package, 
which was approved by the regents last spring 
behind closed doors and became the focus of 
much public criticism of the UC administration. 

Severance pay and contributions to Brady's 
retirement fund will bring the university's total 
payment to over $200,000. According to 
Peltason, however, Brady has decided not to 
accept an additional $230,000 he was eligible 
for from a deferred compensation package that 
he designed for all top UC administrators. 

According to documents released by the 
Office of the President, Peltason has known

Proposals on 
Regent Refonn 
Pass Committee 
REFORM: Two constitutional 
amendments propose to shorten 
regent tenns, confmnation process 
By francisco DeVries 
News Editor 

Two legislator-sponsored constitutional 
amendments that could drastically a1terthemake-
up of the UCRegents passed the State Assembly 
Committee on Higher Education on Tuesday. 
The 6-3 votes on both bills were split along party 
lines. 

Both bills must now pass through at least 
another three committees and receive a two-
thirds majority vote in both houses of the legis-
lature to be placed on the California state ballot 
sometime next year. 

The farthest reaching of the amendments is 
Assembly Constitutional Amendment (ACA) 
20, which was authored by Assembly Higher 
Education Committee Chair Marguerite Archie-
Hudson (D-Los Angeles). The amendment is 
also being sponsored by the University ofCaJi-
fomia Students Association (UCSA). 

UCSA President Tobin Fried said in a state-
ment yesterday that "because of their recent 
actions, the regents have completely tarnished 
what was the most prestigious public university 
in the country. ACA 20 is a solid first step 
toward restoring the university's reputation." 

Archie-Hudson's consultant to the Higher 
Education Committee Christopher Cabaldon 
said yesterday that " the regents need to look 
more and act more like California," a goal that 
"cuts across party lines." 

Cabaldon said that Archie-Hudson remains 
"optimistic" that she will get the required 54 
votes to pass the amendment out of the Assem-
bly despite the party-line opposition in the Edu-
cation Comminee. 

Fried said in an interview yesterday that "It's 
going to be hard worle to get it out [of the 
Assembly] ," but added that "there is a lot of 
support." 

The amendment would redistribute the cur-
rent regental appointment procedure, which 
currently allows the governor to appoint 18 of 
the 27 regents, by dividing the appoinunents up 
equally among the Assembly, Senate and gov-
ernor.

'Derby Days' Rai_ 
$2,500 for Charities 
ByK.-. ........ 
Staff Writer 

About 4OOpeople participated in 
the Sigma Chi fraternity's fourth 
amuaI "Derby Days" last weekend. 
TIle aim of the event was to raise 
money for charity and assist local 
philanthropic organizations in San 
Diego. 

According to the event's chair 
Stephen Kremser, about $2,500 was 
raised for the Children's Miracle 
Network and the UCSD Early Child-
hood Education Center. 

Members from various UCSD 
fraternities and sororities panici-
pated in "Derby Days" activities, 
which included a vo\1eyball tourna-
ment, a lip-sync competition and a 
BBQ, with food donated from 
Johnny Rockets. 

According to sponsorship coor-
dinator Jeremy Howard, ticket sales 
from the BBQ, in conjunction with 
local and national sponsors such as 
"Jammin' Z-90" radio station and 
Marine Sunwear, raised the neces-
sary funds. Members also panici-
pated in a scavenger hunt in which 
six garbage bags full of clothes, 
blankets and food were collected 
and given to San Diego's Coalition 
for the Homeless to be distributed. 

The culminationoftheevent was 
Saturday's "Philanthropy Day," 
during which about 125 ' students 
went to four local organiZations to 
participate in community assistance. 
At the City Heights Community 
Clean-Up, students repainted houses 
and fences, helped with yardwork 
and picked up trash. 

"TIle guy from the organization 
said thai wesaved him about $1 0,000 
through our efforts," Howard said. 

Students also helped at St. 
Vincent de Paul's Shelter by hand-
ing out food and doing maintenance 
wort, while others packaged food 
at World Share to be distributed to 
the homeless. 

"We got people involved so that 
they want to go back [and help 
again]," Howard said. 

Some of the money raised will 
be donated to theOtildren 's Miracle 
Network, an aUiance of about 160 
hospitals across the United States 
which gives money to people who 
cannot pay for health care on their 
own. The UCSDChildhood Educa-
tion Center, a developmental pro-
gram for children of UCSD stu-
dents, faculty and staff will also 
receive some of the proceeds, 
Howard said. 

Kremser said that Sigma Chi 
members plan to change next year's 
event by introducing new activities 
and providing service to different 
organizations in order to maintain 
interest and participation. 

"People not in the Greek system 
think (Derby Days] isasociaI event. 
But we raised more money [forchar-
ity] than any other organization on 
campus," he said 

According to Howard, "Derby 
Days" is rumored to have started in 
the 1930s at UC Berkeley and is the 
Sigma Chi fraternity 's national phil-
anthropic event, raising over half a 
million dollars annually. "The aim 
is fun and philanthropy," he said-

A.S. MEETING NOTES 
eoq, NegotIatIoM- Approximately 30 coop members attended last night's 
meeting to lobby the A.S. to continue negotiations on the coop Memorandum 
of Understanding. Last week the A.S. voted to stop negotiations after the latest 
agreement was refused by the coops. Co-op member Chloe Burke read a letter 
requesting that the A.S. amend the document to fIX some of the 19 problems 
cited with the current draft of the Memorandum. Acti~ President Carla Tesak 
defended the current Memorandum, which the A.S. signed earlier this month. 
"I don't think the A.S. would have signed a document which would put [student) 
autonomy on the line," she said. "I do believe the A.S., coops and GSA can see 
eye to eye on [problems) one through 19, but if we open up negotiations, the 
administration will come up with their own list of problems," she added. The 
council agreed to meet with coop members in a special session to be held next 
Monday. Tesak also arranged an informational meeting for the new council 
members, many of whom did not serve on the A.S. last year and are not familiar 
with all of the specifICS of the negotiations. 

Alternative Media AllocatIons- Commissioner of Communications BikÂ·Na 
Park addressed the controversy surrounding the allocations to campus 
altemative media. She acknowledged that the Media Committee's proposed 
budget cuts will have a large impact on campus media, such as a 4,000 copy 
limit. Additionally, all media publications would be restricted to 16 pages per 
issue. She urged alternative media to utilize the "A.S. Ads" advertiser-soliciting 
service to supplement their current A.S. funding. Â·We would like to take part in 
making ASUCSD Campus Media as strong, efficient, and stable as possible. 
One of the steps to making this possible is by helping the media become more 
self-suffiCient and autonomous,Â· she said. No members of altemative media 
publications spoke at the meeting.

Professor 
Elected to NAS 
Membership 
By Suzanne Phan 
Staff Writer 

Larry Squire, professor of psy-
chiatry atthe UCSD School ofMedi-
cine, was elected last month to the 
National Academy of Sciences 
(NAS), one of the most prestigious 
scientific organizations in the coun-
try. 

Squire, a neuroscientist at the 
Veterans' Affairs Medical Center, 
was the only member of the UCSD 
faculty admitted this year. He joined 
10 other University of California 
scientists among the 60 new mem-
bers and 15 new foreign associates 
selected. 

"It is an honor for me. It's an 
honor for the people I work with," 
said Squire. "I hope to continue to 
do the best I can." 

NAS is a private organization of 
scientists and engineers that serves 
as an official advisor to the federal 
government in matters concerning 
science and technology. Present 
membership includes representa-
tives from the fields of biology, 
physics, chemistI)', mathematics and 
certain social sciences. 

UCSD Biology Professor and 
NAS member John Singer said 
Squire's selection indicates the high 
quality ofUCSD's scientific faculty. 

"It's a prestigious title .... It means 
a lot to the people in the profession. 
Membership in the academy equates 
with quality of the faculty," Singer 
said. 

BRADY: DC 
administrator to get 
paid after retirement 
Continued from P8Ie 1 
about the agreement between 
Gardner and Brady since Sept. 29, 
1992 - one day before Brady left 
office - but decided not to make 
it public before last week. 

University of California Stu-
dents Association (UCSA) Field 
Representative Donny Emerick 
said the action was "a classic ex-
ample of the old boys' network" in 
the Office of the President. 

"It's a slap in the face for stu-
dents working two jobs [in order] 
to go to school," Emerick said. 

When Peltason took over the 
helm of the UC in October, many 
within the university had hoped 
for a new openness within the UC 
after the back-room deals prior to 
Gardner's retirement. 

According to UC Spokesman 
Ron Kolb, Peltason's decision to 
withhold information about the 
package did not contradict his com-
mitment to openness and direct 
communication. 

"It was a question of priori-
ties," Kolb said. "He didn ' t feel 
that this particular issue should 
have been dealt with at that time. 
Had he done it then or had he done 
it now, the decision would have 
been the same." 

UC Spokesman Rick 
Malaspina added that it is not un-
usual for a senior administrator or 
chancellor to take a paid leave of 
absence because, unlike other fac-
ulty members, they do not get sab-
baticals. Although Brady is not a

The UCSD Guardian 

member of the faculty, Malaspina 
said the fact that Brady had ap-
proximately 100 days of unused 
vacation time figured into the de-
cision to grant him the paid leave. 

Student Regent-designate and 
. UC Davis junior Darby Morrisoe 
said Peltason's action represent 
his unwillingness to foster open 
communication with the regents 
and the public. 

"Iamextremelydisappointed," 
she saia. "I had hoped with 
[Peltason 's) term, the Office of the 
President would begin to open lines 
of communications with the re-
gents. But the president's refusal 
to inform the regents in a timely 
fashion demonstrates that that is 
not his intention." 

Brady will continue to work 
part-time for the UC during his 
one-year leave of absence. Al-
though he will step down as senior 
vice president July I , he will con-
tinue to assist the UC in managing 
its three national laboratories. 

In a letter to the regents dated 
May 10, PeItason wrote that he 
intends to honor Gardner's com-
mitment to Brady "in recognition 
of his dedicated service." 

He added that Gardner' s actions 
are legally binding but pledged to 
seek regent approval forfuturede-
cisions regarding paid leaves. 

Emerick said that. if legally 
possible, Peltason should avoid 
paying Brady, adding that bad pub-
licity stemming from the incident 
will hurt the entire UC. 

Morrisoe agreed. "This could 
cost us millions of dollars," she 
said. "This could not have hap-
pened at a worse time in the budget 
process."

More of the Same Nonsense 
From UC System Executives 

After the public outcry last year over fonner UC President David 
Gardner's $2.4 million retirement package, one would hope that UC 
system administrators had learned their lesson. The enormity of the 
regent's largess was astounding, especially considering that the 
package was approved at a time of grave fiscal crisis in the UC 
system. While Gardner was collecting $2.4 million in benefits, UC 
students were facing fee hikes, larger class sizes and a decline in the 
qual ity of education. The Gardner package was a public humiliation 
for the university, leading to embarrassing audits and immeasurable 
damage to its reputation. 

Apparently, no one learned anything from the mistakes of a year 
ago. That can be the only explanation for last week's announcement 
that outgoing UC Senior Vice President Ronald W. Brady will 
receive a full year's salary of$181,640while workingonlyparttirne. 
Brady is, of course, the man believed by many to be the architect 
behind Gardner's retirement package. Last year, Gardner approved 
Brady's salary. which he said is "consistent with practice I have 
followed during my tenn as president for retiring chancellors and 
vice presidents." 

What is most galling about this latest development is that UC 
President Jack Peltason has known about the agreement between 
Gardner and Brady since September 29, 1992, but only made it 
known to the regents last week. Peltason, you may recall, was highly 
praised when he was selected for the presidency for his commitment 
to open communication. 

In an interview with the DailyAggie, the student newspaper at UC 
Davis, Student Regent-designate Darby Morisroe said, "I had hoped 
with [peltason's] term, the Office of the President would begin to 
open lines of communication with the regents. But the president's 
refusal to inform the regents in a timely fashion demonstrates that 
that is not the intention." 

The Brady salary is just another example of the back-room deals 
that characterized the UC system's days of free-spending and 
extravagant packages for high-ranking administrators. If anything 
positive could have come out of the Gardner fiasco, it would have 
been an understanding that the university should conduct its affairs 
openly and that it should curb its wasteful administrative spending. 

In the past few weeks, UCSD students have seen what the 1993-
94 academic year has in store. Classes will be reduced, faculty will 
not be hired, resources will be scarce and some departments may 
suffer devastating cuts. On top of ~his, students will face another fee 
hike while faculty wiU have to bear a five percent pay cut. With all 
this occurring, the Gardner-Brady agreement isn't merely ill-timed 
- it's completely appalling. 

If UC administrators want students and faculty to make sacrifices 
during the budget crisis, they had better be prepared to share the pain. 
That means cutting back on needless positions. That means prohib-
iting executives like Brady to make off like bandits while everyone 
else struggles to get by, 

In a May 10 letterto the regents, Peltason wrote that he intends to 
honor Gardner's agreement with Brady "in recognition of his 
dedicated service." What about recognizing the needs of students 
and faculty? Or even recognizing that the days of administrative pork 
should have ended long ago? 

Peltason also heralded Brady's decision to decline his deferred 
compensation, thereby saving the university $230,000. How gener-
ous. Perhaps Peltason, Brady and the regents could do us all a favor 
by forgoing the $181,640 as well.

the "flagship" of the UC system, they should not be facmg the same

COALITIONS MUST UNITE FOR 
THEIR SHARE OF EMPOWERMENT 
COMMEN1'ARY: After listening to Angela Davis and Elizabeth Martinez speak at 
UCSD last week, it's clear that the time has come to build coalitions on this campus 

GAYE 

As Americans become more pre-
occupied with the growing diversity 
of their country, coalition politics 
are pushing themselves to the fore-
front of socio-political discussionS. 
It seems that people - especially 
those of color and women - are 
realizing that there must be coali-
tionsand suppon among groups with 
common causes. 

identify yourself with the alienation that propels it. This 
is a movemenl in which alienation is literally pounding in 
your ears, and what its appeal is to a white upper class -
and what their place in it is- is one oflhe many questions 
you have to ask about this and OIher movements. 

I'm not suggesting that white people do not belong in 
these types of movements. But you have to ask yourself, 
especially now, where everyone fits with respect to a 
coalition. 

I had the privilege of interviewing Angela Davis and 

JOHnson I suppon this notion of coalition Elizabeth Martinez last week. What they had to say with respecl to coalition-building makes them rrue revolutionaries, even in a year like 
1993, when revolutionaries are difficult to 
find. 

in the broad sense. es-
pecially when itcomes 
to-8T0ups and women 
of color. But I am also 

wary of many people's definitions of "coa-
lition," because where the aim of many 
oppressed groups is to fight American sys-
tems of discrimination, there are a lot of 
other groups jumping on the bandwagon, 
claiming victim status to legitimize their 
place in a coalition. 

Thankfully, Angela Davis put this all-
too-common claim to rest last week: "Why 
do we compete for the status of being the 
most downtrodden victim? /' m tired of be-
ing a victim!" 

It is an age when even though it may be 
one of the most difficult times to be of color, 
it is also a time when it is most enviable to 
be of color, to be oppressed, to involun-
tarily appear to be against the system by the 
very nature of your color or gender. 

We find this mirrored in the most telling 
gauge of social relations - that of popular 
culture. You find that hip-hop culture, 
emerging from panicularly oppressed black 
environments, is inundated with white 
middle-and upper-class connoisseurs, Ex-

For two women so involved in progres-
sive, ethnic-specific movements, it is truly 
revolutionary to be able to step away from 
the specific "in-house" issues and give 
whole-heaned suppon to the liberation of 
all people. It requires a more holistic view 
of the world, and of the human condition in 
general, without ignoring the issues spe-
cifIC to different ethnic groups. 

What I appreciated most about what 
these two women had to say was that 
people of color involved in political move-
ments have to de-emphasize whites' per-
ceptions about people of color; stop adopt-
ing those methods of prejudging one group 
over another. This means that a 
multicultural coalition would have to not 
only displace these types of prejudices, bul 
also decenter white participants in a 
multicultural movement. I could feel the 
collective gasp of many of the whites in the 
audience, because I think many blissfully 
deny to themselves that no matter where 
they are, they are still the center of atten-
tion and affirmation,

THEBATILE 
CONTINUES 
FOR STUDENT 
INPUT 
COMMENTARY: Students 
need to let the new board know 
how they feel about fees 
By Andrew Clark 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

The University Center Board (UCB) is dead. 
Long live the UqA)B, the University Cen-

ters Advisory Board. 
The UCB was"disesrablished"by Vice Chan-

cellor of Student Affairs Joseph Watson back in 
February, but I cherished a hope deep in my 
hean thaI upon examining the evidence, ajudge 
would bang his gavel and render justice. This 
did not happen. The California Superior Court 
dismissed the UCB 's case and sealed its fate. In 
my opinion, this afftrnls that the regents were 
justified in co~mining grand theft. 

"Grand theft" may sound like hyperbole, but 
it isn 't. The estimated revenue from the Univer-
sity Center Fee next year is $1,973,850. That's 
$112.50 from every graduate and undergradu-
ate student. Student input into the operation of 
the Price Center and Student Centers is now a 
maner of "advisory control" - a newspeak 
word that translates as "the UCSD administra-
tion controls the advice it gets from students." 

I recognize that the UCSD administration-
from the chancellor down to the University 
Centers director - feels that it is acting in the 
best interests of students. I do not (unlike some 
of my former UCB colleagues) believe that 
"administration" has evil intent. I can see their 
logic. It's summed up by the phrase, "We know 
what's best for you. " 

This paternalistic attitUde is the wall that I 
have been helplessly flailing against for nearly 
a year now. This fight is over - the windmills 
have shattered my lance - but life must go on, 
and UCSD sludents must playa crucial role in 
Ihe expenditure of student referenda fees. As 
Graduate Student Association (GSA) President 
Patrick Carroll put it, "'This is taxation without 
representation!" He's right. 

There are four student referenda fees, and 
they fall into two categories: student govern-
ment fees and facilities fees. The A.S. and GSA 
fees ($13.50 and $5.(0) are student govenunent 
fees, and the five percent A.S. election turnout 
indicates that students are generally satisfied 
with how these monies are spent - or they 
don't care - or they think voting is a waste of 
time. 

Facilities fees are the big ones: the $70 per 
quaner that kicks in next year for building the 
RIMAC spons facility and the $37.50 Univer-
sity Centers Fee for the operation and mainte-
nance of the Price Center and Student Centers. 
That's almost $110 a quarter, and student input 

, into how this money is spent has been reduced 
to "advisory" status. This means that students 
can say what they want, but the regents always 
know best. 

If students want to have a say in how these 
facilities fees are spent, then they had better 
make it known now. The new UCAB's charter 
will be drawn up this summer - convenienl, as 
most students are outoftown-andthe RlMAC 
advisory board will probably be presented to 
students as a "done deal" next fall. 

How? Talk to the A.S. Talk to your college 
councils, who appoint your official UCAB reps. 
Comer your favorite authority figure and ask 
him or her. Bener yet, ask Jim Carruthers or his 
secretary where and when the UCAB meetings 
are and come to them. 

If students don't want to have any say in how 
facilities fees are spent, then someone should 
have told me last September and saved me a heU 
of a lot of grief.

The UCSD Guardian OPINION 5 

COMMENTARY: When building coalitions among people of color, whiteness can 
neither be centralized nor excluded, regardless of what some recent critics may claim 

TOWARD A MULTICENTRIC VIEW 
I went to hear An-

gela Davis speak at the 
"Building Coalitions 
Among People of 
Color" conference last 
week. I'd like to use that 
speech as a means to re-
spond to some criticisms 
thaI have recently ap-

GREGORY peared in these pages 
rTEPHE~ regar~ing .myconcept?f J J IJ amulttraClalcommumty 

in which the common-
ality and difference co-
exist. 

Aside from Ms. Davis' speech, this confer-
ence struck me on the whole as a rather nause-
ating example of the racial romanticism and 
blame-whitey thinking that often festers 
unexamined beneath the surface of that 
multicultural mantra, "people of color." 

Davis followed Elizabeth Maninez, a 19605 
holdout stilI stuck in the Us vs. Them worldview 
of that era Here in 1993. Martinez was still 
telling her audience to "tell THE MAN what 
we need." She advised "people of color" that 
"we don't have to like each other - we just 
have to trust each other on the battlefield" 
where they could be united by "some enemy 
we want to destroy together." 

But Ms. Davis brought some fresh air into 
an environment where it would have been all 
too easy to merely confinn the lazy thinking of 
the people who worship her. Angela Davis is 
that rarest of "culture heroes" on the left, one 
who actually uses her privileged position to 
challenge the preconceptions of her audience. 

Davis began her speech by discussing her 
encounter with a white woman who com-
plained that this coalition-building between

"people of color" was making her feel left out. 
"Where is my place?" she wanted to know. 
Davis responded indirectly with adefmition of 
multi-ethnic coalition-building that is one of 
the few I've heard that goes beyond "a con-
glomeration of people who aren't white." 

Davis argued that networking among non-
whites should not be about excluding whites 
but rather about creating "straJegies!or coali-
tion-building that don't centralize whiteness." 
But at the same time, she made it clear that it 
wasn't about centralizing blackness or any 
other position, either. 

Davis has recently blasted black anti-Asian 
violence, and she broadened that into a cri-
tique of black ethnocentrism (as in the phrase 
"black people and other people of color"). She 
criticized those who see blackness everywhere 
-apparently in reference to an earlierspeaker, 
akenle-headed Afrocentric New Age "healer" 
named Starla who had talked aboul the "black-
ness of oneness" and asserted that Spain lacked 
culture before colonization by the Moors. 

Davis pointed out that her own activism 
had never been confined to "blackness," that 
she had been supporting Latin American self-
determination since 1959. Her commitment to 
social justice had multiple allegiances and 
expressed irself in multiple languages, she 
noted. 

Like Davis, I think personal history is 
directly relevant to how one approaches coa-
Iition-building.1 don't feel "left out" by " people 
of color" coalitions. But I do often feel demon-
ized; that my personal history is made invis-
ible. I am a "white man" married to a "black 
woman." This choice has political implica-
tions: the only coalitions or communities my 
wife Valeria and I will suppon are going to 
have to be multiracial - including, but not 
centered on, whites. 

We share this COl)cem with over two mil-
lion other Americans in interracial marriages 
-as well as millions of others who live, work, 
and play in multiracial contexts. Many of us 
have spent our lives working to "decentralize 
whiteness," as Davis says, but it does not 
foUow that we have to reject whiteness, only to 
see it in context. Those of us who live with our 
feet in more than one world are going to resist 
definitions of community like "peopl.e of color" 
that malc:e color lines the primary defmition of

THE COMMUNICATION DEPARTMENT DESERVES RESPECT 
Editor: 

I suppose it is my responsibility as Chair of 
the Communication Departmentto respond in 
Rodney Dangerfield fashion (oh my God, a 
reference to the dread popular culture, and a 
passe reference at that!) to the attack on the 
department by the Guardian's Ben Boychuk 
("Communication Breakdown," May 17). It 
seems that every three or four years the Guard-
ian finds it necessary to print a screed on the 
Communication Department As the accom-
panying,thoughweak-knced,defensebyPhilip 
Michaels suggests, for some reason Commu-
nication functions for various campus con-
stituencies in much the same way as the scape-
goat did for the Jews of the Old Testament. 

Let me address a few of Mr. Boychuk's 
comments and correct a couple of his asser-
tions. First of all, the Communication Depart-
ment consist of 18, not 32 faculty members. (If 
we only had such resources! Perhaps Mr. 
Boychuk would like to accompany me when 
I next speak with my dean.) Of those ) 8 (two 
of whom have joint appointments in other 
departments), four have received prestigious 
Guggenheim fellowships and one aMacAlthur 
"genius" award in the .past few years. Four 
others have won prizes for their most recent 
books. Communicalion facultymembersregu-
larly are cited for their extraordinary commu-
nity service. 

But Mr. Boychuk may not be concerned 
with such objective evaluations of the excel-
lence of the Communication faculty. Hewants 
to discuss undergraduate teaching and the 
Communication curriculum. As for teaching, 
Communication is one of the few departments 
on campus that as a matter of policy puts its 
most senior professors in its introductory and 
core courses. We require a fmal seminar of 
majors in an effort to synthesize the perspec-
tives and themes covered in the curriculum. 
The curriculum does indeed run a gamut from

the study of popular culture to the emergence 
of a global information ecOOomy because, 
quite simply. that's whal the field ofCommu-
nication is about. 

Theaux ofMr. Boychuk' s attack is his attack 
on Herb Schiller. One gets the impression from 
Mr. Boychuk's column that Hem Schiller is the 
life and soul of the Communication DepanrnaIt.

for everyone. 

Professor Schiller is an internationally rec-
ognized scholar of communication. His per-
spective is valuable, and he is a great teacher. 
Mr. Boychuk has serious problems with Pr0-
fessor Schiller's perspective. So be it BUI Mr. 
Boychuk proceeds to paint the enIire Commu-
nication curriculum with the brush of his gross 
caricature of Professor Schiller's teaching. 
And he does so without any evidence of hav-

ingtaken butacoupleCommunication courses 
and without any evidence of having spoken to 
anyone but a handful of the Communication 
majors he so evidently reviles. 

TheCommunicationDepartment,likemost 
depanments, has a variety of professors with 
a variety of approaches and perspectives. We 
must infer from his attack on the Communica-
tion Department that Mr. Boychuk values 
scholarship. Perhaps he should have done a 
little empirical work before he engaged in his 
ill-informed denunciation. 

Editor:

Chair and Associate Proressor 

Department or Communication 

Ben Boychuk' s commentary seems a bit 
bitter to me. He, like a lot of people I know, are 
jealous of the fact thal I will graduate in four 
years while exerting little effort when it comes 
to my studies. TItere are some Comm students 
who do all the readings and take extensive 
notes in class - but the nature of the major 
allows me to do well while homework is a non-

. factor in my life. But what Mr. Boychuk 
doesn't seem to realize is that my B.A. in 
Comm means as much as my roommates in 
AMES. I'll get a job regardless of the major I 
choose because it's who you know and not 
what you know. 

As far as Herb Schiller goes, if you would 
sit in on one of his infonnativeÂ· and entertain-
ing classes, you could stand to learn a little 
somedling. I reaJize this might not get pub-
lished because it doen't meet the academic 
"status quo" you refer to in your piece. But 
being a Comm major has allowed me t.o enjoy 
my four years or college u it is not all that 
demanding. And, oil yeah, Ben - ShIdy hard 
and get good grades in your chosen major. I'D 
be out having a good time.

their people on this campus. In light 
of the suggestions given by Davis and 
Martlnez, I think it would be a very 
constructive move to build a more 
effective coalition between the groups 
of color on campus. 

While the administration is pull-
ing a fast one on everybody, there are 
some groups who will be hit hardest, 
and most visibly. What a shame to 
have to say these groups went out 
without a fight For those more hesi-
tant to make such a move, I think it is 
important to reaIize that for the time 

being, it may be all that can be done to 
kccp this a somewhat integrated insti-
tution. 

Listening to Davis and Martlnez 
restored a lot of hope for me in the 
potential of people to make a change. 
If two women who can achieve as 
much despite the despair that they 
have seen, I think it is the least we can 
do to build coalitions which speak to 
the injustices of this institution and 
put a little more faith in the possibility 
of overthrowing its perpetuating seg-
regation.

COALITON: 
No one group or color 
can be excluded 
Continued from page 5 
that community. 

Ely Rabani recenlly pegged me as 
a "liberal" who is "twitchy" about 
confronting the history of racial op-
pression and my own "white privi-
lege." I understand Ely 's desire to be 
on Ihe "right side" of our multi-ethnic 
future, but he needs to speak for him-
self on "white privileges." In fact, 
I've lived beneath the poverty line 
most of my life; most "people of 
co lor" I meet in college settings come 
from far more privileged backgrounds 
than my own. 

To see a truly reactionary display 
of current "thinking" on "white privi-
lege," pick up a copy of Alternative 
Visions, a UCSD "women's journal." 
Here you will find non-white women 
telling why they don 't want white 
women at their meetings. (But I must 
say miff respect to Laura Tubelle, 
who writes of people who assume 
that she is ethnocentric because of her 
blond hair and pale skin. She says, 
"when you assume you make an 'ass' 
out of ' u' but you can', manufacture 
me.") , 

[ am as resistant to left/white as to 
black/white or oppressor/oppressed 
dichotomies. Many of my friends are 
liberal, but my parents are Republi-
can fundamentalists, and as much as r 
disagree with their politics, I must 
confess thatthey apply their Christian 
ethic in a more inclu ive way than 
most of my leftist friends. Putting 
people in boxes ignores their personal 

history and closes off our ability to 
work together on partial common 
goals even as we continue to struggle 
over panial differences. 

In an April 15 column, Gaye 
Johnson assumes that my "perpetual 
advancement of music bringing 
people together" reflects my igno-
rance of the "crises of mankind." She 
feels that she is doing more to solve 
this crisis by quoting Ice Cube saying, 
"we'll fuck them like they fucked us" 
than when I quote Bob Marley on 
"One Love." 

While I am sympathetic to the 
aims of Johnson and Rabani, I sense 
that they are both trapped by the limits 
of oppositional thinking. Being aware 
of history is a different thing than 
being trapped by it. If you spend all of 
your time criticizing the old. you have 
no energy left to create the new. No, 
we can't forget our history, but if we 
stare in the rear-view mirror too long, 
we risk a head-on collision with the 
future rushing up at us. 

Being prepared for that future re-
quires a vision: a vision of what Ralph 
Ellison called an "ideal democracy." 
That ideal is not meant to exclude 
awareness of the past or our present 
crisis. Rather, it serves as a horizon: a 
long-range goal to keep us from get-
ting lost in short-range struggles. As 
Vaclav Havel points out, an "ideal 
democracy" will never be fully real-
ized, butthat does'not mean we should 
cease moving toward that horizon. 

Often I use the terminology of 
representatives of various ethnic 
groups to support my arguments, lhen 
laugh when this same terminology is 
attacked by people who only see a 
white face mouthing these words. For 

".. Guardian: 

The UCSD Guardian 

instance. Ely Rabani has accused me 
of engaging in "warm-fuzzy-touchy-
fccly exhortations" when I used the 
tenT\"multicentric world" in an April 
26 column - not realizing that the 
concept of being "multicentric" comes 
not from me but from Chicano activ-
ist Guillermo Gomez-Pena. 

You can find this essay in the High 
Performance Review. 1989. Gomez-
Pena writes that terms like "minor-
ity," "marginal" and 'Third World" 
are dangerous and must be used "only 
with extreme care." For him , 
multicentric means recognizing that 
none of us in America is pure, and that 
having our feet in more than one 
world is not a liability but an asset. 

If you don't believe that identity 
politics has dangerous long-term con-
sequences, then look at Yugoslavia, 
Sri Lanka, Sudan and other nations 
where color, ethnicily or religion has 
been used to exclude an outgroup. 
We've already begun to head down 
this path with a nation full of people 
claiming special privileges (includ-
ing the privilege of using rhetorical or 
physical violence against their "en-
emy") on the basis of both real and 
mythological forms of victimization. 

"Why all this competition for sta-
tus as 'who's the most oppressed'?" 
asked Davis. Long-range coalitions 
would have to be based on more than 
opposition to whiteness, she insisted. 
because anything pursued to an ex-
treme becomes its opposite. People 
become like what they most hate. 
"Decentralizing whiteness" as a me-
dium-rangecuitural and political goal 
will indeed require a multicentric ho-
rizon that neither centralizes nor ex-
cludes whiteness.

the board. 

Campbell's spokesperson 
Myra Tumer said that ACA II 
was not in competition with ACA 
20, but had been in the making 
since last August and was submit-
ted because Campbell felt that it 
had a beaer chance of passing. 

"[Roben] Campbell kind of 
looked at the reality .. . how can we 
get a bill [that reforms the regents] 
through?" she said 

Turner added that ACA II 
would serve to diversify the board 
because "the Assembly is more 
willing to rake people over the 
coals." 

UCSAExecutiveDirector Andy 
Shaw said that the UCSA supports 
the Campbell amendment but that 
the UCSA "wanted a lot more." 

"[Campbell] simply believes 
there is no way we'll get [ACA 20] 
passed," he said. 

Cabaldon said that it is likely 
thatACA 11 and 20 will be merged 
into a joint amendment at some 
point. 

Both amendments were referred 
to the Assembly Committee on 
Elections and Reapportionment.

UCSD-TV: 
Grpup seeks student 
involvement at station 
ContInued 110m .... 1 
to learn in it," she said. 

UCSD-TV also hopes to diver-
sify the ethnic make up of the sta-
tion. 

"Right now, there are no people 
of color on the [1(3500 Program-
ming Advisory Panel]," VA gradu-
ate student and UCSD-TV member 
Eloise DeLeon said. "We'd like to 
see the board become more accu-
rately representative of the univer-
sitycommunity,perltapshavingthe 
entire station begin an affirmative 
action program to actively recruit 
people of color." . 

RepresentativesofK35DG indi-
cated that they are receptive to many 
of UCSD-TV's proposals. 

"The philosophy of the station is 
to bring the total of the university 
into the community," said K3500 
ProgranuningAdvisory Panel mem-
ber and Media Center Director 
Sherman George. "When students 
meetthatprogrammingphilosophy, 
I'm sure they'll get aired. 

"In the long run, six months to a 
year from now, we will be including 
student-produced and faculty-pro-
duced programming," he added. 
.-Associate Vice Chancellor of 

Extension StudiesarKl K3500 Gen-
eral Manager M8I)' Walshok, in an 
electronic mail message, said that 
the station does not currently have 
guidelines for including student and 
community productions. 

"K35DG has no special policy 
favoring student work," Walshok 
said "We also have no special policy 
favoring faculty work, freelance 
productions orconventional sources 
of programming such as the 
Ahnenberg Project [a national orga-
nization that funds public televi-
sion]. The only criteria we utilize at 
this time is the quality and fit of the 
prospective progranuning with the 
mission of K3500." 

UCSD-TV members will meet 
with Walshok on June I to discuss 
the details of their plan. 

MembersofUCSD-TV stressed 
that their goal was not to replace the 
present structure of K35DG, but to 
make it more accessible to students 
and more reflective of the cultural 
diversity of the campus commu-

nity. 
"The station's bylaws mandate 

that it show work that is of interestto 
the entire broadcast area." Halleck 
said. "But even more importantly, 
we have an opportunity here to show 
alf oTSan Diego what UC students 
are capable of. This is an opportu-
nity that could benefit the school, 
the station, the students, the com-
munity, everyone." 

UCSD-TV members reaffinned 
their commitment to cooperate with 
the management ofK35oo. 

"Basically, what we'd be doing 
is putting a structure in place that 
would assist K3500 in getting stu-
dent and community programming 
on the air, rather than the station 
having to find it and select it without 
help," Bemsdorf said. "We want to 
supplement their current program-
ming, not replace it." 

"UCSD-TV is doing our school 
an important service," Halleck said. 
They're setting up a mechanism to 
get student-produce.d video on 
K35DG. They're also helping the 
station fulfill its stated mission by 
helping provide culturally diverse 
programming that better reflects the 
local community."

SUN: Latest Blues Traveler release is its best 
Continued from pap HI 
However, Traveler's sound is actu-
ally more similar to the blues rock of 
bands like Living Colour. 

Drummer Brendan Hill recently 
discussed Blues Traveler's develop-
ment since its debut album in 1990. 
"From an early age we were not 
dependent on much else besides our-
selves and our ability to play music, 
so that was our bread and butter," 
Hill said. 

"We're very much a live band; 
records were kind of secondary for 
us in the beginning. It was a goal of 
ours to be signed, of course, because 
that 's how you reach new fans. The 
fi rst two albums were finding our 
legs, and I think with this one we've 
found out how to make a record flow 
smoothly, and I think it's our best 
album yet." 

In reference to their live perfor-
mances' Hill said, "We playa lot of 

music from alJ three albums, as well 
as many songs that aren' t on any 
album. We enjoy the freedom of not 
playing the same set every night, 
which a lot of bands get sucked into, 
so a lot of people do come and see us 
more than once. We segue into songs 
and experiment a lot live." 

Hill said that although band mem-
bers have received some criticism 
for copying the standard blues sound,

Bmng rlrt and Politics 

Works by 
British activist 

and artist 
Conrad 

Atkinson are on 
display in 

Mandeville 
Gallery 

W hen an allist juxtaposes two fields which nor-mally oppose one an-
other, an interesting and 

novel creation often results. British 
anistConrad Atkinson is well-known 
for his innovative style incorporat-
ing the worlds of art and politics. His 
exhibit, "Conrad Atkinson: Selected 
Works" is currently on display in the 
MandevilleGallery . 

As both an artist and activist, 
Atkinson concentrates on the con-
nection between aesthetic, philo-
sophical and ideological theories. 
His work is an attempt to deduce the 
practical effects these ideas have on 
the world. 

Throughout the last 20 years, 
Atkinson has exhibited his work in 
Britain, the United States, Australia, 
Russia and throughout Western Eu-
rope. Using various medIums such 
as painting, sculpture and print, his 
art has appeared everywhere from 
London Underground stations and 
the sides of buses to major popular 
museums. 

With a tenacious focus on society 
and culture, Atkinson's work targets 
major issues of our time, such as the 
dominance and manipulation of mass 
media, consumerism, the elitism of 
high culture and the deterioration of 
civil rights. 

In his current exhibit, Atkinson 
utilizes popular iconic images com-
monly disseminated by all types of 
media. By focusing on journalism 
and sports heroes, he presents his 
satirical view of the gap between 
politics and aesthetics. 

The majority of the exhibit con-
tainsmock versions of the front pages 
of English, French and U.S. newspa-
pers. He alters the newspaper name 
and various sections of tellt by paint-
ing with acrylic oil pastel over the 
newsprint and handwriting in his 
own messages. 

In "The W~I Street Collapse," 
Atkinson creates a series of manipu-
lated or fictitious publications upon 
which he writes, "Capitalism has 
collapsed.communism has collapsed 
[and now] we can all concentrate on 
aesthetics. " 

Following this transformation 
from politics to aesthetics, he also 
replaces caricatures of world leaders 
with artists and musicians who then 
become the referees of supremacy 
and judgement. 

Another work displaying similar 
cynicism is "The AZr Street Jour-
nal ." On this front page replica, 
Atkinson draws a direct correlation 
between infectious diseases and p0-
litical and cultural values. 

He writes phrases such as "inter-

Atthl 
aJ !ht 

illl tkM Itd.~ I 
}or;t If " 

11/ I' ( 
~<itM 
.. . 

esting ideologies created from vi-
ruses" to demonstrate how illnesses 
have spread and contaminated the 
mentality of so many people. For 
him, these illnesses are culturally 
produced and perpetuated by the 
hegemonic influences of the media 
and other powerful stratifications. 

Atkinson's personalJy-designed 
front page of a section of the London 
newspaper, The Guardian, is an-
other highlight. He titles the page 
"The Daily Consumernica," and em-
phasizes his overriding theme of the 
conflict artists have with political 
figures and issues. 

Headlines read "Michelangelo 
Questions Western Priorities On 
Famine Relief And Cash Cropping 
In Third World" and "Reagan Tax 
Plan At Odds With Divine Spirit 
Alleges William Blake," recapitu-
1ating Atkinson's simultaneous dis-
satisfaction with the political system 
and wistfulness for more artistic in-
fluences. 

Three large cloth hangings of dig i-
tized laser jet acrylic on linen and 
two long parallel carpets are also 
part of this eclectic installation. The 
linen pieces reveal three identical 
photographic images of a football 
player in complete uniform with the 
words "culture," "art" and "theory" 
written on his pants. 

Titles such as "The Search For a 

Conrad Atkinson'.

sesses Me Constantly," touch on the 
issue of politics in sports. 

The carpets, titled "Equals," to-
gethercreatean "equals sign," which 
relates to individual and cultura1 iden-
tities. Atkinson draws parallels be-
tween the situations of'Asians who 
now live in a particular region around 
HaJifax, England and the immigrants 
who lived thereduringthe nineteenth 
century. He views culturaJ circum-
stances from regional, national and 
global perspectives. 

Atkinson ellpresses an overall 
concern about the world around him. 
He appears to bedcdicatcd to change 
by offering a more artistic way of 
life. 

Through works which offer con-
troversial views, he attempts to elu-
cidate the faults and ineffectiveness 
of our present world. 

As Atkinson humbly says in the 
emibit brochure, "The thing I try to 
do is to render visible the invisible 
things which control the way we see 
things."

Sting 
Ten Sumnwners 

Tales 
AMI ...... 

Don't be surprised if this album 
sounds awfully familiar. Sting may 
be taking a more lightheaned ap-
proach on Ten Summoner's Tales, 
but there isn't anything here that we 
haven't heard on The Soul Cages or 
. . NotlUng Like the Sun. Granted, 
the country twang of "Love is Stron-
ger than Justice (The Munificent 
Seven)" represents a new direction, 
but Sting is essentially reworking 
the saIt1e jazz-inflccted rock tunes 
about love and religious doubts. 

The first single "If I Ever Lose 
My Faith in You" represents Sting's 
newfound satisfaction with his mar-
riage and his family. The song 
"Heavy Ooud No Rain" is an at-
temptathurnorabouttheunpredict-
able weather, but the story of a 
confused farmer is not much differ-
ent from the dry humorof"English-
man in New York." 

Sting even seems conscious of 
his repetition compUlsion. He in-
cludes the already well-known Le-
thal Weapon II hit "It's Probably 
Me" on this album, and he closes the 
song "Seven Days" with lines from 
a Police song. The track "She's Too . 
Good for Me" is funny only because 
the track is about a woman who 
finds Sting too much of a rebel. 
With Sting's penchant for light New 
Age material, it is pretty hard to see 
any rebelliousness in his music.

Sand Rubies 
Sand Rubies 

Sand Rubies not only represents 
a name change forthe Tucson-based 
Sidewinders; the album also fea-

that's been co-opted in the interests 
oftourism and big business. "Your 
Life Story" is also a poignant indict-

tures some big-name 
producers such as 
Waddy Wachtel and 
Heartbreaker Mike 
Campbell. The group, 
which helped develop 
the Southwest sound 
with its 1989 album, 
Witchdoctor, has cre-

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ment of someone who 

ated some real gems for its self-
titled release. 

The first three songs are all top-
notch. The opening track "Goodbye" 
is about the frustration and despair 
of a break-up, and it has a good 
balance of both tender and frantic 
moments. "Santa Maria Street" 
showcases vocalist David Slutes' 
talent - he sounds like R.E.M's 
Michael Stipe as he evokes the sen-
timent attached to a streetcomer 

lives as if he or she were 
acting out a role in an 
adventure film. The 
Campbell-produced 
"Guns in theChurehyard" 
is brilliant, and the use of 
the bouzouki and man-
dolin gives the song mu-

sical depth to accompany its soul-
searching tone . 

The harder-edged songs on Sand 
Rubies are less successful. 
"Drugged," "Hit the Breaks (At the 
Pearly Gates)"and the Neil Young-
penned "Interstate" meander with 
overlong solos by guitarist Rich 
Hopkins. Nevertheless, Sand Ru-
bies shows that Hopkins and Stutes 
are developing into a talented duo.

AnENTION GRADUATE STUDENTS: 
POSITION STATEMENT ON GSA BALLOT 
All GSA memhus should be now be in receipt of the GSA 1993 Ballot and Survey. Please take 
five minutes to complete the survey so that the GSA can more effectively represent you . /t was 
decided by the GSA Council that 1, as President of our organization. should draft a GSA 
position statement on the ballot. 
I. GSA ACTIVITY FEE INCREASE: I believe that a $5.00 fee increase would be necessary 
to ensure that we have sufficient funds to cover all our needs. i.e., increased costs. obtaining 
'lIutonomy from the administration. employing the President, and fully equipping our office (we 
could do with a fax and a photo-copier, and our computer equipment is on its last legs)_ A $2 
increase would cover the basics but we would probably not be able to make the President's 
position paid. I'd like to see 55 approved but would be pleased II we got $3. 
m. GRADUATE STUDENT ASSOCIATION RIGHTS: (1- YES) A right to vote would 
give some reason for silting on committees. (2 - UCSD GRAD STUDENTS) It is my position, 
and I have made this known repeatedly to the administration. that the officers of the GSA are 
answerable solely to the GSA Council which, in tum, is accountable to the graduate student 
body. (3 - YES) I believe paying the president is absolutely essential if grads are to have the 
capacity to run for office. My own experience is that I could not do the job effectively even 
though my academic work was suffering due to lack of time. Then I had the added flUJlration of 
complaints from my department. Past Presidents have had a similar experience. (4 - YES) When 
I arrived here from Ireland I could not believe that the administration held that graduate students 
could not be trusted to handle our own affairs. Although this is an insult, it is not, in my view, 
the real reason. The admin knows that once they control our money they control us. Gening 
control over our money, therefore. is absolutely crucial. (S - YES) Same again! 
IV. UNIVERSITY CENTER BOARD: (1- NO) The GSA's position on the UCB was totally 
ignored by Joe Watson. We did not even get the courtesy of a phone call. I learned about the 
disestablishment from the Guardian, even though I represent a constituency who directly fund 
that board to the tune of about $337,000 per year. What is this but contempt? (2 - YES) The 
bottom line must be this: if we are going to totally fund these facilities then we have a right to a 
degree of control over the way they are used and to whom the space is granted. (3 - YES) 
Obviously! (4 - YES). (5 - YES). (6 - YES). 

LJCSD's KILLER DEAL LCSD's PARTY FEAST V. GRADUATE STUDENT HOUSING: (1. NO) I believe this scheme for differential rent for students living in exactly the same housing is unfair. uncalled for. and a precedent for the 
development of a complex tiered system through which students who have not yet arrived will 
be ripped off.

VI. GRADUATE STUDENT HEALTH INSURANCE: (1- neutral) 
va RIMAC: (1 â¢ NO) Graduate students have consislently made it clear that we do not want 
RIMAe and we cenainly cannot afford it--ilt present the administration intends to suck another 
$630,000 per year out of grads to pay for this facility (about $3.5 million if we include 
undergrads), and this whil~ they simultaneously plan to eliminate the Dept. of Physical 
Educjltion! 
vm. SERVICES: (1- NO) We believe that sanitary services for women on this campus should 
be looked upon as a basic necessity and a basic health/hygiene requirement. (2 â¢ NO) Recycling 
services at UCSD are pitiful and we must demand better from a higher education institution.

The Story of Qin .In 
T he greatest surprise of The Story of Qiu Ju, the latest film by China' s most renowned film director Zhang 
Yimou, is its stanling and beneficial change 
in direction from the Yimou 's previous work. 
Both of his two recent past 
projects, Ju Dou and Raise the 

the couple's allotted land, Qiu Ju (Gong Li) 
demands an explanation or apology from the 
chief. Qiu Ju 's attempts to obtain an answer 
destroy the stereotype of the passive Chinese 
woman. Nearing the ninth month of preg-

nancy, she travels long distances 
under hazardous conditions and 

Red Lantern, drowned in their 
attempts to comment on Chinese 
society because of the director's 
overemphasis on visual aspects. 

However, The StOlY ofQiuJu 
represents a new effon to expose 
the arbitrary rule of Chinese Com-

rtlYIE 
kE11EI 

confronts multiple levels of bu-
reaucracy, all in the pursuit of jus-
tice. 

Unfonunately, the lack of mo-
mentum that results from the re-
petitive nature of a story about a 
woman's appeal to village, district 
and finally city officials is exhaust-munism by focusing predomi-

nantly on the story itself. The two-time Acad-
emy Award-nominee creates more than at-
tractive aesthetics and permits the audienceto 
act as voyeur to the everyday life of the 
Chinese peasant. 

The Story of Qiu Ju relates the tale of a 
frustrated wife's efforts to achieve justice for 
a wrong inflicted on her husband. After Qiu 
Ju 's husband is kicked "where it counts" by 
the village chief in a dispute over the use of 

ing at times. Only Zhang Yimou' s documen-
tary-style directing rescues the film from 
these slow moments. The director presents 
some wonderful scenes that capture the es-
sence and variety of the Chinese people by 
allowing a hidden camera to qiuetly record 
the daily street scenes in each ofQiuJu 's new 
destinations. 

These elements of nco-realistic style foot-
age are cleverly brought together with the use

SUN: The Gin r-------------, 
Blossoms' 
debut album 
shows talent 
Continued from ..... H2 
thei r reinterpretation of the old clas-
sics possesses originality. " I think, 
lyrically, every song you write is [a 
product I from the time that it is 
written:' he said. 

"There are different attitudes, 
playing styles and influences. You 
do backtrack a little bit, but you take 
a new path. What is now rock 'n' 
roll all began with the blues, and it 
has been developing ever since." 

"We 'reson oftributing the blues. 
All music comes from the heart and 
soul, which is what blues is: the 
painful cry of someone who has lost 
something. The blues isn ' t lost now," 
he added. 

The Gin Blossoms, the 91 X fla-
vor-of-the-month, will precede 
Blues Traveler with its own brand 
of alternative-pop. If you missed its 
recent gig at the Belly Up Tavem, 
you should catch tile band's perfor-
mance tomorrow night. 

For a fairly new band, this Ari-
zona quintet offers an extremely 
refined live show. In a recent inter-
view, bassistBilI Leen said, "We've 
got the energy onstage. We really 
have the whole performance thing 
down." 

Leen said that the band's songs 
transfer well from its debut album, 
New Miserable Experience, to the 
stage because, "When we record 
our songs, we try not to use so many 
effects that we won 'I be able to play 
them live. We're definitely a live 
band." 

The Gin Blossoms' sound is an 
amalgamation of a variety of styles, 
from the Smithereens to the Steve 
Miller Band to the Judybats. Lead 
singer Robin Wilson's vocals evoke 
a son of decongested Michael Stipe, 
and the guitars of Jesse Valenzuela 
and Scott Johnson jangle in true 
altemative-rock abandon. 

The Gin Blossoms will definitely 
put on an impeccable Ii ve show and 
yes, it will play its hit, "Hey Jeal-
ousy ," along with a lot of other great 
rock tunes and a little bit of country 
to bool. 

Opening the concen is local an-
ist and UCSD favorite Blacksmith 
Union. ThesetwiUfeaturetheband's 
newer material from its second al-
bum, Magic Maggie Healing Dol/. 

Blacksmith Union's sound has 
been compared to everyone from 
U2 to Pearl Jam. The band always 
puts on a great live show which 
e~ompasses its brooding, sensitive 
sound as well as its harder-edged 
rock tunes. Get there early ,as Black-
smith Union kicks off its set at 7:30 
p.m.

BERKELEY: 
Student government 
is being reevaluated 
ContInued from page 1 
Dean of Student Life Francisco 
Hernandez was formed at the re-
quest of Ihe chancellor's offite in 
March, according to Kenney, who 
is also a committee member. 

The ASUC has enjoyed relative 
autonomy since its inception in 1887, 
holding decision-making power for 
all ASUC business and organiza-
tional operations. "[ASUC Presi-
dent] Margaret Fortune is basically 
the CEO of a $17 million corpora-
tion," Kenney said. 

Hemandez said he did not think 
the evaluation raises questions over 
the ASUC's autonomy. Kenney 
agreed, noting, "Our interest is in 
the ASUC remaining a viable orga-
nization. We fully intend to have 
student government on this cam-
pus." 

However, ASUC External Vice 
President Greg Lewis said he sees 
the evaluation as "very clearly a 
threat." 

Lewis accused the university 
administration of attacking students' 
ability to organize'''for a variety of 

political reasons and from several 
fronts." As a result, Lewis said, stu-
dent leaders have been forced to 
spend time fighting the university 
rather than working on student is-
sues. 

UCB's evaluation of the ASUC 
comes at a time when autonomy of 
student govemment bodies is an 
issue at UCSD, following conflicts 
over the CCHJpS. the disbanding of 
the University Center Board and an 
annual $270 student fee for building 
the RlMAC sports facility. 

According to Kenney, the object 
of the committee's greatest fiscal 
concern is the management of the 
ASUC bookstore, which has been 
forced by losses to take out a second 
line of credil. The bookstore has 
until July I to show a profit in order 
to extend its loan. 

The committee will also look at 
"all aspects of ASUC operations, 
including personnel, contracts, busi-
nesses and physical plant," Kenney 
said. 

University officials are con-
cemed that the ASUC also stands to 
lose revenue due to the California 
Supreme Court's February ruling in 
Smith v. UC Regems. In this case the 
court ruled in favor of a student who 
objected to the use of his mandatory 

The UCSD Guardian 

student activities fee to fund politi-
cal groups with which he did not 
agree. 

Regarding the issue of safety, the 
committee will investigate the cur-
rent upkeep and security measures 
inplaceatASUC-runbuildingssuch 
as Eschleman Hall, where a 20-
year-old junior was found stabbed 
to death Feb. 7, 1992 after a late 
afternoon meeting of the Pilipino 
American Alliance. The victim's 
family has filed a negligence suit 
against the university, which owns 
the building, although the ASUC 
controls it. 

1be subjects of the committee's 
evaluation, Kenney said, "are all 
areas that are a great liability to 
ASUC." However, especially re-
garding the two lawsuits, the uni-
versity itself is also responsible, she 
added. 

Kenney and Hemandez said that 
since the committee is only in the 
infonnation-gathering stage, there 
is no set deadline for it to pass on its 
findings to the chancellor. Accord-
ing to Kenney, the evaluation may 
yield a recommendation for the uni-
versity to become more involved in 
ASUC responsibilities to varying 
degrees, from offering advice to 
completely taking over functions.

Calamity in KalamaZOO: 
Tritons Fall in Opener 

Associate Sports Editor 
The UCSD men's tennis tearn, 

making its 13th trip to the NCAA 
champion-
ships in 16 
seasons, lost 
in the opening 
round, 5-2, to 
Swarthmore 
College on 
Monday. The 
opening -
round defeat 
ended all 
hopes for 
UCSD's fU"St-
ever NCAA 
team title. 

The Tritons fell behind early in 
singles play and were unable to gain 
any momentum. Senior Jeff Bethard, 
UCSD's number-one singles player, 
lost in straight sets, 7-5, 6-3. UCSD 
fell behind 2-0 when John Cross suf-

fcred a lopsided defeat. 
At number-three singles. junior 

Vern Yarnell, in a valiant attempt to 
stop UCSD's losing skid, dominated 
the fU"St set against Swarthmore's 
Khalaf, winning 6-2. But Khalaf 
roared back, taking the second set 6-
2, setting upadramatic third set show-
down. In the decisive final set, Khalaf 
prevailed, 7-6. Yarnell's marathon 
defeat put the Tritons down. 3-0. 

UCSD's woes in singles play con-
tinued when number-four Robbie Ho 
lost in straight sets, 6-2, 7-5. With 
four losses on the afternoon, the Tri-
tons needed to sweep the remaining 
two singles and three doubles matches 
to defeat Swarthmore and advance to 
the second round. 

The Tritons staved off defeat in 
number-five singles with junior Roy 
Gessford's 6-4, 7-5 triumph. 

Down 4-1, the Tritons got another 
reprieve when Jeff Young came up 
big in number-six singles. Young, a 
freshman, played like a seasoned vet-
eran on the way to a thrilling three-set 
victory, 6-3, 0-6, 6-2. Young 's win

The Triton women faced east-
ern foe Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology in first-round action 
and mercilessly swept all singles

sive 9-0 victory.

The UC San Diego women 's ten-

positive note, placing fifth overall 
in the country at the National Colle-

Round two featured a rematch 
oflast year's third-place match. But, 
this time it was the Golden Gusties 
who emerged the victor, withstand-
ing a flurry of Triton rallies and 
blowing the San Diego squad into 
the loser's bracket. 

Freshman Yumi Takemoto was 
also down 5-1 in the third set against 
Franklin and Marshall, but amaz-
ingly served and volleyed her way 
to a 5-5 tie. She displayed the expe-
rience of a veteran, demoralizing 
her Diplomat opponent and stealing 
the tiebreaker.

According to LaPlante, without 
Takemoto's win UCSD might not 
have placed as well as it did. 

The Tri-
tons' fifth-
place tally 

marks the second consecutive year 
in which the Tritons have finished 
among the top five in the nation. 

The Tritons bounced back 
quickly by clobbering the Franklin

from Pennsylvania. The win al-
lowed the Tritons to advance to the 
fourth round where they easily 
defeated University of South, Ten-

Moe's two 75 rounds give him a 150. 

After two days of play, the teams 
may be gening to know the course, 
but the course itself is changing , and 
not for the better. 

"The course is gening harder. The 
rough and fairway is longer and the 
greens are drier," Abraham said. 

With the rest of the field fading 
fast, the Tritons are gening set for a 
two-team battle. "There are somegood 
players out there," Abraham said. "It's 
going to be a dogfight."

"The tournament was really ex-

and great friendships," said senior 
Nicolas.

WWF almost-action 

~nuecI from pep 16 
a space alien kidnapped them last 
week, had sex with them and told 
them to watch the Home Shopping 
Network for further instructions. 

The really classic pan of the whole 
experience was that Intrepid Phil was 
giving us the results of the match as 
the combatants were getting into the 
ring. He had heard about it through 
his computer wrestling billboard. No, 
I wasn't aware of its existence either, 
but I will be sure to keep my distance 
now that I am. 

Anyway, every one of Phil's pre-
dictions was correct, right down to the 
moves that each winner would ex-
ecute to win the match. 

After a while, you just suspend 
your disbelief, which is harder than it 
sounds, and just sit back and enjoy the 
mind-numbing semi-action going on 
below. That's where it gets fun.

cool stuff. 
The best move of the entire night 

occured during the most entertaining 
match of the night, a tag team battle 
between The Steiner Brothers and 
Money Inc. 

It was for the championshiR, so 
telling you who won is kind of/like 
telling the secret to the Crying Game, 
but I don't care. The Steiner Brothers 
won. 

They won last Thursday, and they 
win win no matter where you see 
them in Milwaukee or Sheboygan. 
Until the rematch, that is, but that's a 
different story. 

Anyway,theendingofthismatch 
was stellar. One of the Steiners 
tossed IRS off the ropes and as IRS 
came running back, the Steiner 
leaped up in the air and locked his 
legs around the still upright, and 
charging, IRS. 

The Steiner rolled backwards, 
dragging IRS with him and reversed 
positions by continuing to roll so that 
IRS ended up on his back with the 
Steiner straddling the fallen accoun-
tant for the pin. 

It was like Lemieux on a 
breakaway or a Jordan dunk or Mon-
tana to Rice. 

Well, maybe not, but it was close.

Instructions 
FromQVC 

I fear for America's youth. 
Last Thursday two hardy souls 

and I, including professional 
wrestling Superfan Intrepid Phil, 
sallied forth to the San Diego Sports 
Arena for a night of WWF action. 

To those of you who have never 
been to a professional wrestling 
eVel}t, and I counted myself among 
you until ~ast week, it is quite an 
experience. Perhaps experience isn't 
the right word. But I liked it, and that 
is what scares me. 

I didn't think I would enjoy 
wrestling. No, I was one of the 
cultural elite who put the WWF 
r!?ughly equal to bass fishing TV 
shows and Bamey the Prehistoric 
Purple Marketing Machine as quasi-
entertainment for imbeciles. 
Wrestling has always been for those 
"other" people - the ones who 
attend UC Riverside, wear tank tops 
with semi trucks on them that say 
"Keep on Trockin'!" and drink 
Keystone for the taste. Not that I'm 
narrow-minded or anything, I just 
don't like those people. But now I'm 
filled with self-doubt because I've 
reached the shocking conclusion that 
live wrestling is almost as much fun 
as trying to spit on people from a 
20th story window. 

It was quite a spectacle. The 
Spons Arena was almost crowded 
with a less than overflowing 
audience of maybe 2,000. We 
wrestling fans are an exclusive lot, I 
suppose. AU the lights were off 
except for the spotlights on the 
squared circle in the middle of the 
arena. 

After several anxious moments 
.anticipating the forthcoming camage, 
it began with a series of smaller 
matches involving names like Virgil 
and Bam Bam. Bam Bam was an 
enonnously fat man who, according 
to Intrepid Phil, was amazingly quick 
for such a gargantuan. 

This proved to be slightly more 
mobile than your average oil tanker, 
but he did take care of a pathetic 
opponent named Kamala, whose 
main attraction was that he was 
stupid. He pre~nded to be so stupid 
that he once pinned Bam Bam on his 
stomach as if he didn ' t know better. 
Ha ha, it was absolutely hilarious, I 
tell you. I guess you had to be there. 
But it proved to be quite amusing to 
the rest of the fans, and this is where 
we get to the scary part. 

Intrepid Phil, whom I trust with my 
life and those of the nearest seven 
innocent bystanders when it comes to 
wrestling facto ids, said with all seri-
ousness that probably three-fourths of 
the people there were "marks." In other 
words, they believe that wrestling is 
real. 

These are the same people, I as-
sume, who believe Elvis is alive and 
well and working at an International 
House of Pancakes in Toledo and that

NCAA DIVISION III GOLF CHAMPIONSHIPS 

Holy Rollers In Control 
~UCSD insecood 
place behind Ohio Wesleyan's Bislq>s

Sports Editor 

The UCSD golf team is doing everything that Head 
Coach Mike Wydra said it would take to win. Right 
now though, it's not enough. In what is rapidly turning 
into a two-team competition, the Tritons trail the red-
hot Ohio Wesleyan team at the NCAA Division ill 
Golf National Championships at Torrey Pines by five 
strokes, 595-590 after two days of competition. 

The Bishops have been the story of the tournament. 
Although it's hard to call the 
second-ranked team in the coun-
try a surprise, OWU has never 
visited Torrey Pines before, and 
yet has rattled off two straight 
seven-over-par, 295 rounds. 

UCSD, which entered the 
tournament ranked third, shot a 
tournament-best round of 294 
yesterday,leaving them in strik-
ing distance for the final two 
days of the Championship. 

The Tritons got off to a fast 
start on Monday, rolling a round 

of30l, almost precisely where Wydra wanted them to 
be. The coach believed that a score of 1,200 could win 
the tournament and the Tritons' 301 on the flJ'St day was 
a good start to the four-day event. 

B utthat was before the Bishops got going. 'They're 
Ii very talented team that's playing great. I don't think 
[defending champion] Methodist can beat them this 
year. That's how good they are. How we fit into that 
scenario, we'll have to wait and see," Wydra said. 

Methodist, which has won the past three champion-
ships, is currently in fourth place with a score of 609. 
Third belongs to the University of Rochester at 608. 
With 13 strokes separating second from third, the 
Tritons are focused on only one team: OWU. ''They'll 
be hard to beat. They've got some good players that are 
playing well," said Triton sophomore Pete Roberts. 

But the Tritons are far from awed by their Midwest 
adversaries. UCSD had three players with one-over-
par 73 rounds yesterday, giving the team a balance 
from the f\l'St golfer to the fifth. Roberts, Brock Shafer 
and Dale Abrallam all tumed in 73s while the Tritons 
top man, Jeremy Moe, went around the par-72, 6,933-
yard course in 75. 

Shafer's 73 was almost agonizing, considering that 
he recorded the score after double-bogeying the final 
hole. Abraham double-bogeyed hole one before com-
ing back and birdieing the second and sixth, while Moe 
had to battle back from being four over after 11 holes.
