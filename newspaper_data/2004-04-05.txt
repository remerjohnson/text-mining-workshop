Dynes announces finalist 
. for UCSD chancellor 
By BRYAN 1SAO 

Associate News Editor 

University of California 
~resident Robert C. Dynes 
announced that Marye Anne Fox, 
currently chancellor of North 
Carolina State University, is the 
finalist for the 
chancellor 
position at 
UCSD. The 
announcement 
was made April 
2, before Dynes 
had a chance to 
bring his deci-
sion before the CouItesy of UCSO 
UC Board of MIIye Anne FGI 
Regents, due to UCSD chancellor 
a news leak. finalist and Qment 

. The Regents ~ 
will convene NCSU 
on April 12 at UCSD to discuss 
and vote on her nomination. 

According to A.S. Vice 
President Internal Jenn Pae, who 
served on the search committee, 
they were all impressed by Fox's 
long list of accomplishments and 
her work with students. 

"Looking at what she's done in 
the past, she's fairly young for all 
the things she's accomplished so 
far," Pae said. "But what most 
impressed me was that the students 
responded to her. She had won 
some past awards [for teachingl, 

including an award that the stu-
dents voted for." 

In addition to acting as NCSU 
chancellor, Fox, who holds a doc-
torate in organic chemistry from 
Darttnouth College, also serves as 
an elected member of the National 

. Academy of Sciences and has been 
a member of its executive commit-
tee. She also sits on the President's 
Council of Advisors on Science and 
Technology,. the NAS Committee 
on Science and Engineering Public 
Policy and is the co-chair of 
National Research Council's 
Government-U niversi ty-Industry 
roundtable. Prior to her appoint-
ment to the NCSU chancellorship 
in 1998, she was the vice president 
for research at the University of 
Texas at Austin . 

"Dr. Fox is widely regarded as a 
fine teacher and mentor, a dedicat-
ed researcher, and a seasoned 
administrator of a large and active 
public research institution," Dynes 
said in an April 2 statement. "In the 
end, my decision was guided by my 
belief that Dr. Fox brings the com-
bination of skills needed to build 
o~ UCSD's reputation as one of 
the finest universities in the 
world." 

According to Pae, Fox's person-
ality also struck her during her 
interview. 

"What impressed me was the 
fact that she was so personable,"

Pae said. "She was very welcoming. 
She was one of the onJy [candi-
dates] who went around and jntro-
duced herself to the whole commit-
tee.!' 

J\ccording to North Carolin~ 
State's campus 'newspaper, 
Ttchnicilln, many NCSU officials, 
including football coach Chuck 
Amato, are disappointed to see Fox 
leaving. Fox was very active in 
NCSU athletics. 

"I hate to see it happen," Amato 
told Ttchnician. "The first time I 
ever met her, she had so much 
energy for the university. She 
brought something here - some 
excitement to excel in everything 
this university does. Everything." 

However, not all reports from 
North Carolina State University 
have been posttive. The NCSU 
FacuJty Senate voted 29-6 to cen-
sure Fox in January 2003 for her 
firing of two vice provosts over the 
objections of the provost, Frank 
Abrams. The provost resigned in 
protest. 

"The university community 
expects that authority be exercised 
with fairness in a non-precipitous, 
reasoned and civil manner," the 
facuJty senate's resolution stated. 
"The authority of the provost has 
been usurped as a result of the 
chancellor's acti'ons. The chancel-

cation to the athletic community," 
the TAC release stated. "Pae's 
four years of support for Triton

Japanese eatery 
opens in Price Center 

By SHANNON EUm 
Staff Writer 

As of spring quarter, UCSD is 
home to a new Japanese restaurant.· 
Shogun of La Jolla, specializing in 
sushi and teriyaki items, opened on 
March 29 on the second floor of 
Price Center next to the recently 
completed game room. 

Shogun's menu aJso includes 
beer, sake and plum wine, though 
the restaurant's license to serve alco-
hol is stiU pending. Shogun wouJd 
become the third on-campus loca-
tion to serve alcoholic beverages. 

For 13 years, Shogun was located 

a few minutes away from campus at 
University Towne Center. One year 
ago, however, owner and manager 
Sean Yoo decided that he wanted to 
move his restaurant to UCSD. 

"I wanted to run a restaurant on 
campus because I wanted to be a 
part of the campus life. 1 was a stu-
dent, and I love the atmosphere," 
Yoo said . "I think [the advantage of 
running a restaurant on campus] is 
much better than elsewhere." 

According to Yoo, the process for 
relocating his restaurant began about 
a year ago when the university spon-

A.S. council allocates over $15,000 
to implement IRV in next elections 

By NEIL SPEARS 
Sen ior Staff Writer 

The A.S. Council allocated 
over $15 ,000 for the implementa-
tion of i nstan t runoff voting on 
StudemLink at its March 3 I 
meeting. The online system 
would be operational in time for 
next year's A.S. elections. 

No senators opposed the allo-
cation, which was approved by a 
vote of 20-0-\. One segment of 
the a1loca tion earmarKs $1,500 for 
the purchase of voting tabulation 
software from Voting Solutions, a 
Northern California-based com-
pany. The second segment allo-
cates $13 ,920 for changes to the 
current voting software used on 
StudentLink. 

"This is not a one-year invest-
ment or a two-year investment or 
something lilee that," Eleanor 
Roosevelt College Sophomore 
Senator ~ax Harrington said. 
"It's a permanent investment." 

The funding a.lso allows 
Administrative Computing and 
Telecommunications to hire addi-
tional programmers to complete 
the project by April 2005. 
According to the estimate provid-
ed by A.c.T., instant runoff vot-
ing modifications will take 11.6 
weeks to complete. 

"Unfornmately, a lot of people 
who are familiar wi th sofrware 
development will think it should-
n't talee that long to code it and 
they're absolutely correct," said 
Margaret Bacleer, manager of 
strategic projects at A.C.T. 
"Coding is only 20 percent of an 
entire project." 

The new software must under-
go lengthy and rigorous testing 
before it is approved for use, 

according to Backer. 
"There's a lot of work involved 

in making just minor changes and 
these are actually prctty complex," 
Backer sai d. 

The road to implement 
instant runoff voting has been 
plagued with obstacles. 
StudentLink programmers 
informed the council in January 
2004 that other programming 
projects would delay the creation 
of online instant runoff voting for 
at least a year. 

The council then scrambled to 
re-write the A.S. Elections 
Bylaws to allow for a standard 
runoff scenario for this quarter's 
A.S. elections. 

The allocation for instant 
runoff voting will come from the 
A.S. Council's mandated reserves 
account, which is earmarked for 
unexpected expenditures. 

"I was surprised there wasn't 
any opposition to it at all," Vice 
President Finance Eric Webster 
said. "I expected it to be a lot 
more controversial." 

Webster said that this allocation 
from mandated reserves, along 
with a $60,000 allocation for the 
new ropes course earlier this year, 
may threaten next year's sti pends 
for councilmembers. Stipends are 
paid from interest generated from 
mandated reserves. 

Instant runoff voting allows 
voters to rate candidates in order 
of choice. A candidate must 
receive a majority of the first-
choice votes to win the race. If no 
candidate receives a majority, then 
the candidate who received the 
fewest first-choice votes is elimi-
nated. Voters who ranked the 
eliminated candidate first will 
have their vote transferrcd to their 

second choice. The cycle of elim-
inating candidates and transfer-
ring votes is repeated until a can-
didate has a majority of the first-
choice vote. 

\¥hile StudentLink mu t be 
modi fied to accommodate the 
ranking system required in instant 
runoff voting, the actua l tabula-
tion of ballots will be computed 
by third-party software from 
Voting Solutions. 

Voting Solutions sofrware nor-
mally costs $15,000, but UCSD 
will be able to acquire the soft-
ware for 10 percent of the price 
because it will be used in a non-
profit and non-governmental 
environment 

"You have to remember that 
the three people who are the part-
ners in this company are not real-
ly business people, we're really 
electoral reform activi t and we 'd 
lilee to see this kind of voting done 
in more places," said Steve 
Willen, chief opera ring officer of 
Voting Solutions. 

Voting Solutions software has 
been used by Cambridge, Mass., 
for city council election since the 
mid- 1990s. Willert said his soft-
ware may be the only utility in the 
world used to tabulate instant 
runoff elections for governments. 

Now that the use of instant 
runoff voting is in sight, 
Harrington hopes that college 
councils will adopt the system for 
their own elections. 

"If you have two people of the 
same mindset, for example, both 
wanting to run ... IRV will encour-
age them to both run , as opposed 
to our current system where they 
are afraid of splitting the vote," 
Harrington said. ". think it will 
improve things a lot, hopefully."

MONDAY, APlUL 5, 2004 

With five candidates IlIDIlin« 
for A.S. President, the A.S. 
Council and student life could be 
taken in many potential directions 
next year. 

Some candidates tout their 
relationships with the administra-
tion. Othen plan to mobilize stu-
dent organizations or restructure 
the student government to become 
more efficient. All of these goals 
are admirable and malte those can-
didates attractive to voterS, but it's 
in the best interest of campus life 
to elect a president who thinks 
beyond the ASUCSO offices on 
the third floor of Price Center and 
will be able to give a less bureau-
cratic, more approachable £ac:e to 
the A.S . Council. 

Independent candidate Steve 
York has enthusiastically demon-
strated the mindset that more 
needs to be accomplished on cam-
pus - namely, jump-starting stu-
dent life beyond Geisel Library 
and even traditional oudets like 
student organizations - ·to 
include the avenge UCSO stu-
dent, not just the groups who 
flood council meetings to demand 
resolutions be passed or their 
funding be augmented. 

While York agrees that student 
organizations and student media are 
the lifeblood of this campus, he feels 
that not enough has been done to 
introduce and promotr: these orga-
nizations to the avenge UCSO stu-

dent. Making student leaders and 
the decision-making process more 
visible to students is a top priority as 
student -administtation conflicts 
regarding the University. Centers 
expansion, non-affiliated but stu-
dent-run "UCSO" services and free 
speech continue to escalate. The 
University Centa1 eIpUISion. York 
feels, typifies bator current leaders 
have not easured stIIdent represen-
tation on an OD-c:ampIS issue to its 
full potential. The Building 
Advisory Committee, while not 
officially the responsibility of the 
Associated Studenl5, has an A.S . . 
representative. It is an undergradu-
ate issue local enough for students 
to actually influence. 

And the local issues are most 
important. Studenl5 First! candi-
date' Harish NaocIappaJ has 
worked on 
statewide 
issues like 
combating stu-
dent fees and 
Proposition S4, 
and the posi-
tions he repre-
sented on 
those issue are only favorable to 
college students in California. 
However, these projects come off 
as bein« partisan and divisive. The 
approach of his campaign, as 
demonstrated at the John Kerry 
event on March 30, is to play up 
me progressive politics of his slate. 
Yet focusing on campus issues

under the duties of the vice presi-

tion on the 2003-04 council. 

Nandagopal rqx-esents the A.S. 
Council Status quo and the students 
who believe lobbying for off-ampus 

propasi~ iIsues is appropriate fix a 
student pemment. His on-campus 
goals, such as lobbying the Academic

paign to stop fee increases. The 
important thing, however, is that 
Nandagopal has put significant 
thought into his goals. But it is in the 
best interest of student life to foem 
primarily on issues and avoid 
a divisM poIi~ agenda. 

The rest of the candidate pool 
is somewhat less attractive. 
Independent candidate Jenn Pae, 
currendy the vice president inter-
nal, is very

endonement of the Triton 
Athletic Council and has efficient-
1y conducted the A.S Council 
meetings this year. However, she 
lacks York's excitement or 
Nandagopal's planning. Pae has 
not taken a finn position on what 
is best for the campus community 

and has been vague as to how solu-
tions can be reached. 

Jeremy Copn. the Unity candi-
date and current 
AS. Ca'1 i dit:aJer 
of En terprise 
Opentions, has 
worked hard this 
year as a com-
missioner and 
has been 
involved in 
many facets of campus politics. His 
mantn is to unify the campus and 
has set forth a list of uninteresting 
ways to achieve this roal. He recog-
nizes that Associated Students must 
be a more visible unit Cor students 
and that the campus climate needs . 
to be improved. Cogan is dedicated 
to reaching goals and says the bud-
get problem can be solved without a 
fee referendum by studying smaller 
budgets of the past and seeing how 
those councils aDocated funding. 
However, Cogan represents the 
bureaucntic side of the A.S.

the book exchange concept into an

have the student government 
experience of opponents like 
Cogan, Nandagopal and Pae, but 
lack of experience hasn't kept stu-
dents from succeeding in A.S. 
leadership positions in the past. 
After last year's disqualification of 
the entire Students First' slate, the 
inexperienced Eric Webster 
assumed the role of A.S. vice pres-
ident finance and has performed 
the duties of his office remarkably. 
In the 19805, the Very Silly slate 
was elected into many of the A.S. 
positions - including president 
- and while there were doubts of 
whether an inexperienced "joke" 
slate could perform their duties 
honorably, records show that the 
council was successful and the only 
difference was that students found 
their leaders to be more fun . 

But York is no joke. While his 
candidacy last year on the 1\1 ew 
Students First 'of the Unity Action 
Parking Wave Slate slate was a self-
affirmed "satirical" campaign, he 
has spent the last year monitoring 
the planned University Center 
expansion and the current flaws in 
the existing (or non-existing, 
according to York) student sttategy. 
He delivers a fresh perspective on 
why student life at UCSD is dismal 
and will continue to stand up to th~ 
conventional wisdom of UCSO 
politics whether he is elected or not. 
York will not pander to a coalition 
of supporting groups - as past 
presidents have done - but will 
produce a much-needed alternative 
way Cor the Assoc;iated Students to 
do business. York must be sur-
rounded by experienced and well-
qualified vice presidents and com-
missioners to be successful, but 
given that, York represents the 
prospect of a leader who's capable of 
building a broader student voice to 
fight the battles most immediate to 
UCSO un~ergraduates.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Melinda Gibson is more than 
qualified to be vice president inter-
nal. Gibson is running on the 
Unity slate, and says she truly 
believes in the ideals of uniting all 
srudents in the UCSD community 
and working to make Associared 
Srudents more accessible to and 
better representative of students. 

In her past work for the uni-
versity, Gibson has worked with 
the council, chaired the Student 
Leadership Engagement Service 
committee and participated on 
the Srudent Regulations Review 
Committee. She also focused her 
efforts on Revelle College 
Council and was the CalPIRG 
chair for one year, during which 

If students vote this year on 
only one vice president position, 
they should make it finance and 
pick Unity's Deais Slunidt. Saying 
that Slunidt is overly qualified for 
the job doesn't even begin to 
describe what he could bring to 
next year's council. Failing to elect 
Shmidt this year would not only 
waste his potential, it likely would 
also waste a lot of money that 
Shmidt knows how to scare up to 
make Associated Students' 
resources stretch to their maximum 
potential. 

Nett year, the A.S. Council will 
face huge cuts - up to $175,000-
because of declining enrollment. 
There has been a lot of fearful aIJc 
about services and srudent organi-
zation funding getting cut, of dip-
ping into mandated reserves, of 

Jared Feldman of the Unity 
slate has both the passion and the 
concrete ideas to make the most 
out of the vice presidency of acad-
emic affairs. The position 
switched from being a commis-
sioner position just last quarter, 
offering the possibility of expand-
ing the position into new realms. 
Feldman has the vision down pat. 

Feldman, who worked in the 
president's office this year, has 
already had a pointed interest in 
academic affairs, and is extensive-
ly knowledgeable about academic 
issues on campus. He recognizes 
the great opportunity. his office 
will have to work on issues in indi-
vidual college's writing require-
ments, which are currendy up for 
review. Feldman is also a great 
advocate for helping to develop

ing environment and con-
sumer rights. 

Gibson is adamant about unify-
ing the entire UCSD student pop-
ulation, rather than focusing solely 
on those involved in student orga-
nizations. She wants to make such 
organizations (Associated Students 
included) more available to the 
avenge srudent who comes to cam-
pus, goes to class and then goes 
horne. She proposes the creation of 
an online database of all student 
organizations that lists not only the 
groups' contact information (as the 
current A.S. Council Web site 
does) but also the groups' interests, 
movements the groups may be 
interested in joining, and events in 
which they would like to partici-
pate. She says that such a database 
would make it easier for students to 
better acquaint themselves with the 
interests of student orgulizations, 
allow student organizations to 
work together, and provide for 
greater commuaication among aU 
students. Another goa1 Gibson has 
is to streamline the process to plan 

passing fee referenda and more. 
Though the budget will ir.evitably 
suffer, Shmidt is the only candidate 
with any ideas about how to com-
pensate. He's assumed the position 
of financial controller in the vice 
president finance's office this year 
- a position that has not been 
filled in the past three years - and 
took it upon himself to start inter-
nally auditing Associated Students 
to find where money could be 
saved. Not surprisingly, he has 
found a lot, and wants to continue 
finding this extra money to reallo-
care it for better uses. 

Some of his ideas are so obvi-
ous that it's amazing they haven't 
already been implemented by past 
vice presidents finance. Setting 
out guidelines for the enemal 
office's traveling expenses is a 
good example. Currendy, accord-
ing to Shmidt, any travel expenses 
reported are reimbursed, with no 
guidelines on what the maximum 
is that can be spent on a dinner, or 
so forth. Giving sensible guide-
lines like this, so that those who 
come to the A.S. Council for 
funds know approximately how 
much they should ask for and 

new interdisciplinary majors and 
minors, which he sees as the 
future of higher education (and 
the reason why so many srudents 
are already double or triple 
majors). Even Feldman's ideas for 
academic-themed housing ate 
well thought-out. easily dispelling 
any fears of huge hails ol engi-

neering majors. As Feldman wise-
ly put it, only the students who 
want that common denominator 
in their housing will choose this 
option, and will enjoy it. This is 
an option that has worked at many 
universities, and more housing 
options will make for happier sru-
dents. 

In addition to all his refresh-
ing visions, Feldman also has a

can and can't be done. He mows

has a limitediCope of experience in

throughout the quarter as funds 
dwindle.

COMMSSIOI«R Of PROGRAMMING EI RISH SHAH 

Rishi Shah of the Srudents 
First! slare is the clear choice for 
commissioner of programming. 
Shah knows the music industry and 
the programming office inside and 

out and has a passion for working 
for the srudems in this position. 
Students would greacly benefit from 
Shah's knowledge and experience, 
in addition to having the opportuni-
ty to operate under a commissioner 
of prograriuning that will go above 
and beyond the office to present the 
best programming possible. 

Shah has been involved with the 
A.S. Programming off;ice for the 
past three years, currently serves as 
the festivals coordinator, is in his 
second year as KSDTs General 
Manager and has worked with such 

companies as Sony and Interscope 
Records. He knows music. Shah 
takes progranuning seriously and is 
receptive to what students want. 
When he plans an event, he 
exhausts lists of bands and contacts 
in order to book a show that· will fill 
RIMAC to the brim. Planning such 
events as Fall Fest and WinterFest, 
Shah has shown that he can handle 
the music side of the programming 
office. 

Also well-equipped to handle 
the financial end of the position, 
Shah is confident that he can use 

es would come together and discuss 
their experiences. Sweeten is also 
dedicated to developing new cur-
riculum with the Academic Senate 
to increase the attractiveness of the 
university to underrepresent~d 
applicants. 

Formerly the ' Sixth College 
Student Council chair and a finalist 
for the Srudent Regent position last 
year, Sweeten ~ proven his leader-
ship skills and has the ability to work 
both with administtators and with 
his fellow students. 

Unity candidate Steven Lei is 
also quire qualified for the position, 
having worked on diversity issues in 
the president's office this year. As a 

in the Greek commWlity, is of ques-
tionable merit. However, she 
expressed f1exibili ty in her goals and 
above all seeks to develop enterpris-
es that improve student life and 
generate the maximum a-:noWlt of 
revenue for Associated Students. 

Fomero's work this year in 
~nterprise publicity is to be com-
mended, particularly her role in 
better marketing the ever-improv-

the programming office's 
resources most efficiently. This 
year, in order 
to save money 
on Pub shows, 
Shah negotiat-
ed with Fine 
Line enter-
tainment to 
secure deals 
and talent that 
ultimately saved the 'program-

Fornero said that she has milch to

the office as well.

shows and make its own money

booking Dave Chapelle). If elect-

Shah's opponent, independent 
candidate Spencer Pforsich, has 
indeed demonstrated his abilities 
this year booking bands for 
lunchtime concerts in Price Center 
as the Nooners coordinator. The 
experience and ideas that Shah has, 
however, make him better qualified. 



8 OPINION 

Kelly Vaunt of the Uniry 
slate is immensely qualified for 
the commissioner of student ser-
vices position. She has served as 
the commissioner of student ser-
vices for the paS[ year, and 

presided over its transition from a 
joint Enterprise Operations-
Srudent Senrices office into an 
independent entity. 

Her experience this year has 
given her a unique perspective on 
the changes that need to be made. 
She has an intricate plan to 
restore the Triton Taxi service to 
the U.S.-Mexico border region 
- a service that was lost this year 
because of Cloud 9 Shuttle's 
reluctance to do business with 
"rambunctious" college kids after

State students, Vasant said. As for 

~I LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Presidential candidate 

unfairly maligned 
Editori 

I was shocked by Kevin Hsu's 
letter in the April I edition of the 
Guardian. I found Hsu's claims to 
be completely unfounded and, 
most importantly, riddled with fal-
lacies. It seems as if Hsu must have 
some personal vendetta agai nst 
Jeremy Cogan to go out of his way 
to publicly bash him in an effort to 
per uade voters to cast their votes 
for some other candidate, particu-
larly one associated with the 
Students First! slate. 

Jeremy Cogan has proven him-
self to be a worthy candIdate for 
A.S. Council president by his years 
of public service, his ability to actu-
ally get results that benefit students 
and his candid care for the students 
of UCSD, Cogan is a candidate 
who I believe will actually stand for 
something useful when in office. 
He believes in uniry across the 
entire campus, which includes all 
students, organizations and col-

leges. Cogan is olle of the few peo-
ple to actually keep a strong tie to 
his college while maintaining his 
current role as the A.S. commis-
sioner of enterprise operations. 

Jeremy Cogan has done an 
immense amount of work to exe-
cute the A.S. ropes course, to 
improve Soft Reserves and 
Lecture Notes and to create the 
Online Bookswap. Furthermore, 
Cogan has succeeded in imple-
menting the dining dollars pro-
gram at the Grove Caffe, which 
many who have held the office 
previously have unsuccessfully 
attempted. All of these actions 
directly affect students, which in 
my mind, is putting students first. 

I t is obvious that where others 
fail, Jeremy Cogan has the ability 
to succeed. Whether students 
want to believe it or not, this has a 
lot to do with experience. I do not 
believe that Cogan or the Unity 
slate stands for bureaucracy, as 
there are candidates on the slate 
who have not held formal posi-
tions within Associated Students 

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

funding sources to reinvigorate 
Triton Taxi, Vasant has pulled in 
S 1 ,700 in new revenue from the 
Senior Memory Book, an A.S. 
service under her supervision, 
and she expects to get money 
from Student Safety Awareness. 

She would create new A.S. 
services, like a La Jolla report 
card - a publication that would 
publicize student-friendly busi-
nesses around the city and inform 
UCSD students about where they 
are most welcome. She also plans 
to colla bora te with the vice pres-
ident of academic affairs to initi-

or college councils. They stand for 
having experienced contenders on 
the slate who want to make a dif-
ference for students through unity, 
and that experience comes from all 
different kinds of campus orvni-

ate an academic advising service 
to cut through the red tape nor-
mally associated with college-
based academic advising. 

Vuant's goals are more realistic 
than that of her opponent, Students 
First! candidate Kiaa MaIeId. 

Maleki is comparatiYdy unquali-
fied, and has never been to a single 
A.S. Council meeting. He has no 
idea what an A.S. service is, incor-
reedy ' naming the Cross-Cuitural 
Center and O.A.S.I.S. as services 
that he thought would fall un~ the 
commissioner's jurisdiction. Maleki 
thinIcs he can get the administration 

zations. Personally, I want the stu-
dent who represents me to have 
knowledge about the office they 
hold, because this can only work 
to my advantage. It is obvious that 
the Associated Students can be 
quite bureaucratic, which proves 
an even greater need to have an 
experienced candidate occupy the 
role of president. Jeremy Cogan's 
experience will allow him to stand 
up for students' rights and desires 
in a more effective way because he 
knows how to actually accomplish 
things. 

I hope that the readers of the 
Guardilln and all students at 
UCSD choose to educate them-
selves about what each presidential 
candidate truly stands for and their 
prior actions; moreover, I hope 
that Hsu's statement will not be 
taken at face-value because I 
believe it to be an opinion which is 
clearly clouded by personal 
grudges rather than a real concern 
for the students of UCSD.

allowed scientists and engineers to 
invent and improve everything 
from household appliances to 
national defense systems. Our lives 
have been profoundly changed by 
the constant flow of innovations, . 
and we can thank our free society 
for expediting the process. 

Technology sought to return the 
favor to democracy when, during 
the March 2 primary election, 
dozens of precincts in San Diego 
County and elsewhere launched 
electronic voting units. I used the 
nifty new touch-screen devices with 
little mishap, but other voters in 
the county were not as fortunate. It 
was reported later that technical 
problems had caused 36 percent of 
the precincts to open late, turning 
away many morning voters and 
dampening the inauguration of a 
new democratic experience. 

UCSD students, not known for 
their passionate participation in the 
democratic process and thus proba-
bly hardly affected by the voting 
booth problems, nonetheless can 
identify with the application and 
misapplication of technology in 
their lives and on campus. 

It's hard to imagine how tedious 

registering must have been before 
StudentLink, and how labor-inten-
sive paper researching must have 
been before the Internet came into 
fashion. Technology is now 
omnipresent, and students are 
among the chief beneficiaries. 

With technology, the potential 
to overextend a good thing is ever 
present and many times grati fied. 
For example, at UCSD, 
Power Point presentations give stu-
dents information and multimedia 
in a concise and condensed form. It 
probably also makes the prepara-
tion of lectures somewhat easier for 
professors. 

However, time and time again 
in my experience, problems with 
video and slides have caused delays 
during lecture that leave the class 
restless and the professor frustrat-
ed. When the PowerPoint presen-
tation does work. on the other 
hand, I find myself and others 
mindlessly copying the slides into 
our notebooks rather than actually 
listening to what the professor has 
to say. I also have noticed that a lot 
less people come to class when the 
slides are posted online. 
Admittedly, overhead transparen-
cies cause the same note-taking 
drudgery, and some classes require 
·complicated graphs and models 
that can only be shown on slides. 
PowerPoint presentations should 
not be banned from the lecture 
hall, nor should they be accepted 
wholesale as an adequate and com-
parable alternative to traditional 
ways of teaching. When used occa-
sionally to accentuate lectures or 
present facts, PowerPoint lives up 
to its name as a powerful tool with-
out reducing learning to a one-
dimensional activity. 

Summer 2004 

One of the effects of technology 
use has been the elimination of the 
paper trail. E-mails have decreased 
the worlc.load of the postman, and 
dissemination of information via 
the Web has cut the need for 
lengthy memorandums and manu-
als. The diminution of paper waste 
can only bode well for the environ-
ment and for efficiency. Students 
too, it would seem, would benefit 
from the transition of 600-page 
readers to onli ne versions. 
However, speaking personally, and 
from reading comments in the 
C.A.P.E. compilations, electronic 

" Technical problems had 
caused 36 percent of the 
precincts to open late, 
turning away many 

. " mommg voters ... 

readers sometimes fail to compare 
to the actual reader. Highlighting 
real paper just seems more effec-
tive. Granted, students can print 
Out selections, but this often results 
in a messy and confused process of 
finding last week's reading print-
outs. As for the savings in bypassing 
the royalties and profits in the price 
of traditional readers, the cost of 
toner/ink, paper and public print-
ing makes the difference less 
impressive. For all its "conve-
nience," the spread of e-readers is 
less handy than at first click. 

Often after I log out of the e-
reader files, I peruse the Web sites 

Dorot Foundation 
Student Travel Scholarship 

The UCSD Judaic Studies Program announces travel grants 
for four undergraduate students interested in spending the 
summer studying in academic programs in Israel, and one 

graduate student planning to spend the summer studying or 
carrying out research in Israel. 

Requirements: 

of prospective graduate schools in 
which I'm interested. A plethora of 
information awaits me, but some-
times in my old-fashionedness, all I 
want is a glossy brochure extolling 
the schools' achievements and cam-
pus beauty. I call their offices for 
paper information, and am fre-
quently told that everything is 
online now, including applications. 
The only unfortunate thing is that 
information on their Web sites is 
useful only when it is timely. 
Admissions statistics for the class of 
1999 isn't really going to help 
much, and "Not found 404" Web 
notices popping up by clicking on 
one expired link after another tend 
to frustrate rather than motivate. 

Even the traditionally flesh -
and-blood college advising has 
turned to technology. With thou-
sands of students to take care of, 
the beginning of virtual academic 
advising makes it easier for students 
to have their questions answered. 
Students can still call in to speak to 
academic counselors, but the 
majority of queries are addressed 
via computer. I happily turn to my 
college's academic advising site, 
exemplary of the good use of tech-
nology. My experience is only 
marred when I call to ask questions 
for unaddressed issues, only to be 
directed to the same site. When I 
express my desire to meet with an 
academic adviser, the same answer 
is repeated. Maybe I don't have an 
urgent problem with my degree, 
and maybe I am not a third-quarter 
senior unsuitable to graduate, but I 
felt like I was bothering the advis-
ing office and asking for a favor 
rather than for a service paid for by 
my tuition . Combined with the 
grad school offices' directive, I've 

started to wonder if Web sites have 
become babysitters for the absen t 
parent of personalized attention. 

Technology has also created 
new problems for others on cam-
pus. I'm sure that administrators 
and faculty alike can attest to the 
serious infiltration of plagiarism 
initiated by the Internet. Coogle 
has replaced the wandering eye as 
the prime suspect in collegiate 
cheating. 

The university will never be a 
wireless enterprise, nor should it 
be. Students will never be 
Luddites, nor should they be. 
Mainstream American society 
bleeds technology from its 
Pentium server-sized pores, and 
our infrasrrucrural and cultural 
veins have already molded ro its 
pattern. While the risk of becom-
ing a computer-controlled Matrix 
world is doubtful. the ri sk of 
accepting the new and improved 
without assessment is not. 
Americans are not known for their 
restraint, and universities such :lS 
UCSD are susceptible to the ame 
mentality that drives kids to tear 
open boxes full of new toys on 
Christmas morning. Universities 
must not unequivocally accept 
technology as the better solution . . 
We are taught to analyze, question 
and debate in college. Why doesn't 
the same apply to t1!e use of tech-
nology on campus? PowerPoint 
slides online cannot replace live 
lecture attendance, and innovation 
cannot replace responsibiliry in 
2004 or 2904.

10 NEWS THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Debate: York, Nandagopal clash over 
Students First! campaign techniques 
conrinued from page r 

problem. We are such an amazing 
university, and 1 think everyone 
should know that, not only within 
the local San Diego community, 
but on a state level and a national 
level." 

York, however, argued that life 
on campus is good. 

"My opponents are trying to 
scare you," York said. "I think 
campus life is great, and if you 
don't think so, you're a social 
retard." 

York stated that his priority as 
president would be to get more 
students involved in Associated 
Students. 

"A.S. is nothing more than an 
advisory board to the administra-
tion .. . and the way to deal with 
that is to get more people involved 
in breaJcing down this campus ide-
ology that you have to be really 
liberal to chase after A.S. goals," 
York said. "A.S. is a closed-door 
club." 

The candidates were next 
asked to discuss how they would 
address parlcing problems. 

"It's the job of the A.S. presi-
dent to make sure they research all 
different avenues," Pae said. 

Nandagopal stressed the 
importance of having more stu-
dent representation on parking 
committees. 

"We need to get more student 
rep on committees to ensure the 
student voice," he said. "We only 
have one student rep on the park-
ing and transportation committee; 
[andl we need to have at least 
two." 

Saradpon answered that he 
would advocate for more parking 
at higher costs. Cogan's solution 
was to expand options for park-
ing permits. York claimed that 
graduate students receive better 
parking services than undergrad-
uates. 

"If you look at these parking 
garages, we're paying most of the 
money on them, and the grad stu-
dents and the faculty get to park 
all their nice little BMWs in 
them," York said. "A.S. really has 
no control over parking." 

Chapman ne1(t asked the candi-
dates what they would do to 
increase student participation in 

campus life. Pae's solution was to 
be more visible to and supportive 
of student organizations. 
Saradpon mentioned the lack of 
student involvement after a cer-
tain time on campus. 

"I want more student involve-
ment because it seems like the 
campus dies after a certain magical 
hour - like everyone has fairy 
dust put upon them and falls 
asleep like in 'Sleeping Beauty,'" 
Saradpon said. 

" There's a lot of 
anger here at the table 

right now for some 
reason ... 

JJ 

- Jeremy eo,an, 
A.S. presidential candidate 

Cogan stressed that outreach 
to student organizations should 
occur throughout the year, not 
just during the elections period. 

"We need to be going around 
to the student organizations year-
round, completely, all the time," 
Cogan said. 

York claimed that the campus 
envirorunent does not encourage 
students to get involved, bringing 
up the disqualification of the 
entire Students First! slate during 
last year's election as an example. 
Nandagopal responded by criti-
cizing York's campaigning tech-
niques and defending the Students 
First! slate. 

Cogan took note of the ani-
mosity during this particular 
debate. 

"There's a lot of anger here at 
the table right now for some rea-
son, and I just think that a lot of 
what needs to happen on campus 
to make people feel comfortable 
... is cutting down the anger, cut-
ting down the bureaucracy, cut-
ting down some of the craziness 
that goes on," Cogan said. 

York and Nandagopal agreed 
with each other on the next 
debate topic, which focused on 
ensuring that the Price Center 

expansion and renovation would 
be completed efficiently. Both 
York and Nandagopal · claimed 
that the administration often lies 
to students for the referendum 
and the construction process. All 
the candidates agreed that more 
student representation and 
administration accountability was 
needed for the referendum and 
the construction. 

The last question asked the 
candidates how they would deal 
with the lowered A.S. budget, 
which is projected to decrease by 
$175,000 next year. 

"The reason the A.S. balance is 
lowering is because there's going 
to be less students," York said. "If 
we cut down across the board 
evenly because there's less stu-
dents on this campus, it malces 
sense. It's all about proportionali-
ty." 

Saradpon agreed with York's 
response. Cogan's solution was to 
look into sharing resources on 
campus and increasing internal 
audits. Nandagopal emphasized 
that major campus events and out-
reach programs should not be cut. 
Pae stressed the importance of an 
open budget process. 

"We need to make sure that 
students come in and help put 
input into the budget process," 
Pae said. 

After the debate session, each 
candidate asked a question to his 
or her opponents. The questions 
focused on student diversity, rep-
resentation and apathy. York sur-
prised the candidates and the 
audience by aslcing his opponents 
which "Star Wars" character they 
would be. 

Throughout the debate and in 
his closing remarks, Saradpon 
publicized this year's Fusion dance 
competition on April 4. 

During the closing remarles, 
Cogan took off his Unity shirt to 
stress that slate status does not 
really matter, but that voting does. 
York followed by taking off his 
own shirt. 

Overall, Chapman felt that this 
years debate turned out well . 

"I think all the candidates did 
really well, and there was a good 
turnout this year," Chapman 
said. 

Chancellor: Fox currently serving as 
chancellor at North Carolina State 

continued from page I 
lor has shown serious lack of judg-
ment in firing two vice provosts 
who commanded widespread 
respect and regard within the uni-
versity community." 

Addressing the NCSU Faculty 
Senate, Fox defended her actions 
by citing her need for a manage-
ment team able to implement her 
vision. 

"I can assure you that these 
decisions were not precipitous," 
Fox told the senate. "They were 
based on many months of com-
munication - writtcn and verbal 
- about the absolute necessity 
for coordinated, cooperative, 
consensus-based leadership in 
Academic Affairs that would 
bring faculty issues to the table 
for full betting. This was about 
teamwork and the open sharing 
of information and th~refore 
abollt the individuals who, as part 
of the leadership of this universi-
ty, could participate actively in 
that teamwork." 

Fox divulged information 
regarding her censure to the search 
committee, according to Pae. 

"The committee was well 
aware of the censure, and I was 
impressed by her composure and 
how she dealt with the situation," 
Pae said. "Amongst all of her 

qualifications, it was also her 
demeanor and what she would 
bring to UCSD that makes her 
the best person to serve as our 
chancellor." 

" In the end, my decision 
was guided by my belief 
that Dr. Fox brings the 
combination of skills 
needed to build on 

UCSD's reputation as 
one of the finest 

universities in the world. JJ 
- Robert C. ~es, president, 

University Of eaflfomia 

According to Dynes' state-
ment, which was e-mailcd to all 
UCSD students, faculty and staff, 
he was forced to revea I Fox's 
identity in an "unanticipated 
fashion" as a result of an informa-
tion leak. 

According to Teclmician, Fox 
revealed her candidacy to her exec-

utive officers and the University of 
North Carolina Board of Trustees 
on the morning of April 2. The 
Technician repotted dut later in the 
day UNC president Molly Broad 
sent a letter to the UNC Board of 
Trustees announcing that Fox had 
accepted the position. Dynes 
announced Fox's nomination the 
same afternoon. 

"When we met [April2l, it was 
all preliminary information," 
NCSU vice-chancellor for stu-
dent affairs Thomas Stafford told 
Terhnician. "Of course, by the end 
of the day, it was all over the 
news." 

According to UC spokeswoman 
Lavonne Luquis, Fox would offi-
cially take office on July I if con-
firmed by the Board of Regents, 
and the wliversity is already giving 
her information about UCSD to 
smooth the transition. 

The university has not yet 
settled on a compensation pack-
age. Luquis and Vice Chancellor 
of External Affairs James M. 
Langley both declined to com-
ment on Acting Chancellor 
Marsha A. Chandler's role at 
UCSD in the event that Fox is 
confirmed.

background can be found at

Shogun: Restaurant moves 
to campus from UTe 

continued from page J 
soeed an open bidding of local 
restaurant vendors to occupy the 
space in Price Center. Yoo jumped 
on the opportunity and Shogun 
ended up as the selected eatery. 

In its first week of operation, 
Shogun seems to have had no lack 
of customer activity. 

According to some students, 
the addition of Shogun is a good 
fint step toward offering students 
and faculty diverse dining 
options. However, some said they 
would like to eventually see an 
even greater number of varied 
restaurants. 

"The reception has been over-
whelming. I am very pleased with 
the number of people who have 
come to eat here so far," Yoo said. 
"At first, I was afraid of not being 
able to live up to the expectations; 
I was afraid of sacri6cing the qual-
ity of the food because of volume. 
1 figured it would be a gradual 
increase, but nothing like this." 

Student reaction to the 
Japanese eatery has been positive. 

"I thought the service was very 
good, and I found the prices' to be 
reasonable," John Muir College 
senior Andrea Esqueda said. 

Thurgood Marshall College 
senior Natalie Wheatfall agreed. 

"[The cashiersl did experience 
a small problem with the credit 
card machine, but I'm sure it's 
nothing that cannot be worlced 
out soon," Wheanall said. "I also 
thought the food was excellent." 

"I'm Klad they're adding new 
options, because 1 get tired of eat-
ing at the same places over and 
over," Revelle College junior 
Caroline Lindsay said. "It would 
be really nice if they added a Thai 
place. and maybe Indian cuisine, 
too. I would be willing to eat on 
campus more often if more dif-
ferent kinds of resta uran ts were 
introduced." 

The philosophy of Shogun, 
Yoo says, is centered around stu-
dents. 

"I love to be on campus and be 
connected with the university. I 
see the university students as my 
children," Yoo said. "I see my 
customers as more than just an 
opportunity to make money. 1 am 
serving them food like 1 would to 
my own daughter or her friends." 

Shogun's hours are 10 a.m. to 
9 p.m. on weekdays, and 11 a.m. 
to 9 p.m. on weekends.

Grievance: Slate members 
to send letters of apology 

continued from page 3 
Revelle College senior senator, of 
using copies of the Nm Indicator 
and Voz FrontmZll as weights to 
help display campaign posters in 
violation of article v.C.l .c. of the 
A.S. Elections Bylaws. The provi-
sion prohibits A.S.-funded or A.S.-
backed organizations from using 
student fees to support or endorse 
candidates or slates. 

"I was kind of angry, as 1 see stu-
dent media really having a hard 
time on this campus," Uiga said. 
"This current crop of politicians is 
promising a whole lot of things for 
student media and here they are 
using [them) for ballasts." 

During negotiations mediated 
by A.S. Elections Manager Tom 
Chapman, the Students First! slate 
agreed to remove the poster 
weights and make an apology to 
both publications in writing. 

The three candidates named in 
the grievance said they found the 
papers in recycling bins of the 
Cross-Cultural Center, where they 
held meetings, and decided to reuse 
them to reduce waste. All three did-
n't think at the time they were 
doing anything wrong, they said. 

"It's pretty standard practice," 
McCombs said. "Once those old 
issues are recycled, they're pretty 
much in the spirit of public 
domain, so we really didn't think 
we were doing anything inappro-
priate. But we can see how [the 

publications] could feel bad." 
Based on the evidence presented 

at the informal meeting on April 2, 
Chapman said that he, too. saw few 
grounds for the grievance, though 
explaining that, had Uiga chosen to 
proceed with the complaint, the 
8nal determination would have 
been made by the A.S. Elections 
Committee and not himself. 

However, the candidates agreed 
to apologize as gestures of good 
will after Uiga, who writes for the 
Nm Indicato,., explained that mem-
bers of the publications were 
offended, Nandagopal said. 

"I think I partially agree [with the 
compromisel, in that we probably 
shouldn't have used anything that 
could've caused problems. I feel bad 
that the editors of the publications 
were a little offended," Elder said. "1 
think the formal letters of apology to 
the publications are in order, and I 
have no problem with that." 

The candidates praised the 
process of infonnal contlict resolu-
tion, instituted for the first time in 
this year's elections. 

"I was very pleased that we 
worked this out in an infonnal 
hearing, because it's important to 
show that the informal hearing sys-
tem worles, and that grievances can 
be resolved to the satisfaction of 
both parties without mass disquali-
fications," McCombs said.

Get to know the real Dr. 

T heodor Seuss Geisel was born March 2, 1904, in Springfield, Mass. Although 
many often think of him as the 
grandfatherly figure of his later 
years, Geisel anended Dartmouth 
University and was a typical college 
student. He was editor in chief of 
Jack-O-Lantern. the humor maga-
zine at Dartmouth, but was 
removed from his position after 
throwing a party that went against 
some of the university's policies. 

So, not to be kept from publishing, 
he began submitting works under 
the name Seuss. This is the first 
known instance of him using his 
famous pseudonym. It fooled the 
university offici~ls, and a character 
was born. 

Geisel started work as a cartoon-
ist and was approached by Standard 
Oil to do advertisements for them. 
He was already drawing in his dis-
tinct style with Horton-esque ele-
phants and turtles that looked like 

Oh the places you1110: Aftef May 24, the library will have the eJ<hibit "Dr. Seuss 
Between the Covers; whefe his books from 1937 to 1990 will be on display. 

Yertle. He worked for more than 15 
years in advertising, selling every-
thing from Ford cars to Holly 
Sugar with his uriique creations. 

During World War 11, Geisel 
helped the Army create training 
films. The animated fiIrns featured a 
trainee named Private Snafu, and the 
narration was set to rhyme. While 
many were skeptical of a canoon to 
train soldiers, the young recruits 
responded well to the movies. 

The first children's book that 
Geisel was involved with was a 
bland book of children's sayings, 
interestingly titled "Boners." 
While the book failed, Dr. Seuss 
was launched into the world of 
children's literature. In 1937, he 
wrote his own text to accompany 
his artwork for "And to Think I 
Saw it on Mulberry Street." The 
rhythm of the book was based on 
the incessant rhythm of the engines 
of a luxury liner he had been travel-
ing on. 

"The Cat in the Hat" is Seuss' 
most well-known book, but few 
realize it started as a textbook for 
children. Houghton Mifflin and 
Random House asked Geisel to 
write a children's primer using 220 
new-reader vocabulary words to 
get kids interested in learning to 
read. While schools did not jump 
on the idea of using the book as a 
primer, it became wildly popular 
and remains so today. Publisher 
Bennen Cerf of Random House 
made a bet with Geisel that he 
could not write a book with 50 
words or less. "Green Eggs and 
Ham" was born as a result of that 
bet. 

In 1948, Geisel moved to La 
Jolla into an old observation tower, 
which he called "The Tower." He 
lived and worked there the -rest of 
his life, locking himself away in the 
tower to work on his books in 
secret. He rarely shared his 
progress and often left essential 
pieces blank from his sketches. 

During the 1970s, Geisel's 
friend Art Buchwald, the famed 
columnist, was harassing him about 
never writing a political book. So, 
Geisel took a copy of his book 

Seussentenial: In honor of Geisel's 1 00Ih birthday, a statue was efected of him 
with his most famous creation, the Cat in the Hat looking over his shoulder. 
"Marvin K. Mooney, Will You 
Please Go Now!," crossed out 
Marvin's name and wrote in 
Richard M. Nixon. Despite 
protests from Random House, 
Buchwald printed the text that way 
in his column. President Nixon 
resigned the following day and 
Geisel and Buchwald congratulated 
each other on their successful col-
laborative effort. 

"The Butter Battle Book" was 
published in 1984 and was a direct 
response to the arms buildup and 
threat of nuclear war during the 
Reagan administration. The Buner 
Battle illustrates the growing threat 
of war between the Yooks and the 
Zoolcs, who eat their bread butter-
side-up and butter-side-down, 
respectively. The book ends with a 
blank page, leaving the ending 
without a climax, which was very 
controversial .at the time. 
Everything about the book worried 

. Random House, but Geisel defend-
ed his choices and got the book 
published with few changes ~o his 
original version. "The Butter-

Battle Book" was on the New York 
Times Bestseller List for adults for 
six months. 

Over 222 million copies of his 
boQks have sold around the world 
and are translated mto 15 languages. 
He won an Oscar, two Emmys and 
the 1984 Pulitzer Prize. His works 
have been made into CD-ROMs, 
live-action films (for better or for 
worse) and even a theme park. 

To honor Seuss, Mandeville 
Special Collections is exhibiting 
many of his original drawings and 
artwork throughout the year. The 
current exhibition of his advertise-
ments and political cartoons, titled 
"The Dr. Seuss You Never Knew," 
runs until May 8. The next install-
ment, "Dr. Seuss Between the 
Covers," starts May 24 and is dedi-
cated to his children's boo~ from 
1937's "And to Think I Saw it On 
Mulberry Street," to his final "Oh 
the Places You'll Go!" in 1990. In 
October, the last exhibit, "The Cat 
in the Hat for President," examines 
Seuss' lasting influence on 
American popular culrure.

Academic Success Program helps students adjust 
Services such as book-lending and mentoring keep students on track 

lyUSAMAK 
Staff Writer 

Michelle Tsigaridas' parents 
immigrated to the United States 
and had to start their lives from 
scratch in a new country. Now a 
sophomore at Eleanor Roosevelt 
College, Michelle is parr of the first 
generation of her family to anend a 
university, carrying all the econom-
ic burdens and social unfamiliarity 
associated with the role. She real-
ized she needed some help with her 
new educational venrure. 

When Andrew de La Rosa 
arrived as a freshman at Earl 
Warren College, he was not sure 
how to get involved with student 
activities or services outside of a~­
demics. He also faced a financial 
burden in trying to pay for all his 
textbooks. He was searching for a 
way to transition more easily into 
college life. 

Both Tsigaridas and de La Rosa 
benefited from the UCSD 
Academic Success Program, a stu-
dent-run retention program 
designed to help students complete 
their education at the university. 
A.S.P. is unique in that it provides 
financial , academic and social sup-
port neTWorks that make the cam-
pus just a little more welcoming for 
the self-searching freshman, the 
stressed-out upperclassman or the 
adjusting transfer student. 

"The main purpose and goal of 
A.S.P. is to support students in their 
studies on this campus by promot-
ing student retention and providing 
them help in social, financial , as 
well as academic matters," said 
Amara Zafar, A.S.P. special projects 
director. "Our program's aim is to 
find out the students that need us 
the most and help them achieve 

better education and better life at 
this university." 

A.S.P. was pioneered by a group 
of students in the fall of 1997, and 
the program was the first of its kind 
at UCSD. It mainly began as a sys-
tem to allow financially burdened 
students to borrow textbooks. 
Although it gathered initial support, 
a lack of attention and funding 
almost made the program fail. A.S.P. 
leaders managed to pass a referen-
dum on the 2001 A.S. ballot that 
secured sufficient funding for the 
program. A.S.P. is now an Associated 
Students service, receiving $1 per 
student per quaner for its activities. 
Running on an underlying philoso-
phy that those who are admitted into 
UCSD should graduate from the 
university, A.S.P. focuses on working 
with students in an effort to make 
them stay a t the school. 

"If there is a student that ends 
up dropping out, we feel directly 
responsible for them," said Abby 
Hsu, a sophomore at Revelle 
College who interns at A.S.P. 

A.S.P. has come a long way from 
its inception as simply a book-lend-
ing program. It now comprises five 
major programs - book-lending, 
mentoring, academic assistance, 
exam archives and special projects 
- all designed to provide support 
to studen ts. 

However, A.S.P. 's most devel -
oped and most prominent service is 
still the book-lending program, in 
which students-apply for free text-
books to help defray some of their 
educational costs. According to 
Hsu, about 250 to 300 students 
apply each quarter for free books. 
Applicants are evaluated according 
to financial and personal circum-
stances, and books are distributed 
according to each student's needs 

and the limits of the program's 
budget. 

"A.S.P. gives me the opportunity 
to take the classes I enjoy, without 
the burden of purchasing all the 
books when I really don't need to 
keep them after," said Linda Tnn, a 
John Muir College sophomore. 

Another well-developed A.S.P. 
service is the mentoring program, 
which aims at helping freshmen, 
sophomores and transfer students 

" If there is a student that 
ends up dropping out, we 

feel direcdy responsible 
far them." 

- Abby Hsu. Revelle CoIIep 
sophomore 

adjust to their new environment at 
UCSD. A.S .P. mentors work indi-
vidually with students and also 
organize social events, providing a 
tight system of friendship and sup-
port. In addition, A.S.P. gives fund-
ing to other student organizations, 
such as Kaibigang Pilipino, Asian 
and Pacific-Islander Student 
Alliance, Black STUdent Union and 
Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano 
de Aztlan, which all have their own 
organized mentoring program. 

"To keep students nere on cam-
pus, you have to develop some sort 
of attachment, some son of belong-
ing," said Terry Le, A.S.P. executive 
director. "Here at college, the uni-
versity tries to give you that develop-
ment academically, but theres no 
personal development and

Sudi & 7.

through the mentoring program, I 
think there's a lot of potential in stu-
dents helping their fellow peers to 
find their way, to find themselves." 

Many students who receive 
mentoring have had positive expe-
riences with the program. 

"Having a mentor really facili-
tated my transition as an incoming 
college freshman," said Juliana 
Hung, a Revelle freshman. "It's 
great to be able to have someone 
that I can go talk to and bring up 
any problems or questions I have 
about academics . . . or even my 
own personal life. It's so great to 
know that my mentor is always 
there for me." 

Similar to the mentaring pro-
gram, A.S.P. also has an Academic 
Assistance Program, which helps 
to set up tutoring and study 
groups among students with simi-
lar classes. In the future, A.S.P. 
hopes to strengthen this program 
by collaborating with the campus 
Office of Academic Support and 
Instructional Services. 

A.S.P.'s exam archives program 
allows STUdents to access old tests 
and study guides donated by other 
students. A.S.P. is currently work-
ing on a voucher program with A.S. 
Lecture Notes, through which 
needy STUdents will be able to 
receive discounted or even free lec-
ture notes. A.S.P' also organizes 
special projects from time to time, 
including college workshops, to 
help retention efforts on campus. 

Many Students who use these ser-
vices have found them to be benefi-

cia� in their academic and social lives. 
"A.S.P. has helped me financial-

ly and has had a huge positive effect 
on the way I look at and adjust to 
UCSD," said Vy Mai, an ERC 
freshman. "It's programs lik.e A.S.P. 

OPEl loo-Frl: 10am-8Dm, Sal & Sun: 11am-IpRl 

that make me look at UCSD as an 
institution that really makes an 
effort to help out students that may 
lack resources." 

Others have emphasized the 
role A.s.P. has played in their tran-
sition into college life. 

"A.S.P. helped me to have a 
smooth transition into UCSD 
because they provided that extra 
help to get me sta rted in my college 
career, and I am truly thankful to 
their staff for their assistance," de 
La Rosa said . 

Currently, the staff of A.S.P. con-
sists of seven directors and seven 
interns - a group of motivated stu-
dents detennined to reach out to 
others in need of their services. 

"The concept of helpi ng a stu-
dent when you are a student your-
self made me realize that this col-
lege and its community is like my

-Should you eliminate 
carbs from your diet? 

To Your 
Health 

Neha Singh 
"How bealthy is it to foUow • 

10111'- or no-carbohydrate diet? 
What are the pros aad cons?" 

-~ymous 

With the recent Atkins craze and 
"low in carlls!" stickers that can be 
found on food labels everywhere, it 
is almost impossible not to consider 
cutting back on carbohydrates. It is 
very difficult to do it properly, how-
ever, since carbohydrates are in a lot 
of cornmon foods. 

"I would not recommend a strict 
low- or no-carbohydrate diet," said 
Heather McCracken, a nutritionist 
and health educator at Student 
Health Services. "People fail to 
realize that fruits and vegetables are 
mainly carbohydrates. You cannot 
eliminate fruits and vegetables 
without eliminating an abundance 
of nutrients that prOtect against 
cancer, hypertension and heart dis-
ease. I would not recommend cut-
ting out fruits, vegetables, low-fat 
dairy and whole grains." 

Although it's easy to lose weight 
by cutting out carbohydrates from 
your diet, it is mosdy water weight 
that you lose. Most of that weight 
will be regained once you get off 
the diet and resume eating carbo-
hydrates. 

"For every gram of carbohy-
drate we store in our body, we ~tore 
three grams of water," McCracken 
said. "Initially when someone goes 
on a low-/no-carboJtydrate diet, 
their body uses up the carbohy-

drate stores. When they use up 
those stores, the body releases 
water stored along with the carbo-
hydrates, resulting in water loss. 
This weight loss is water, not fat.· 

If you WIIlt to lose weight, the 
most effective way is simply to count 
calories. Low carbohydrate foods do 
not translate into low calories. 

"Excess calor-ies are fattening, 
not carbohydrates," McCracken 
said. "If someone is eating more 
calories a day than they are expend-
ing, they will gain wadlt. It does 
not matter if these cafories come 
from fat, protein or carbohydrates. 
If someone eats too many calories, . 
the excess will be stored as fat." 

In the end, McCracken empha- . 
sizes, a healthy diet is about balance. 
She encourages students to take 
advantage of the various free nutri-
tion-related services -like nutrition 
counseling - offered through 
Student Health Services, located on 
Library Walk 

If you want to find out how to eat 
well and reach your weight goals, 
call (858) 534-8089 for an appoint-
ment. In additiOn, the free Weight 
Management Clinic is available for 
Students. It is run by a dietitian, a 
psychologist and a physician. The 
clinic meets on Thursdays from 3 
p.m. to . 4 p.m. in the second-floor 
conference room at SHS. Feel free 
to show up, since there is no 
appointment needed. 

To learn more about dieting and 
weight issues, attend McCrackens 
lecture, "Exploring Weight 
Management," on April 14 at 5:30 
p.m_ in the fourth-floor RlMAC 
conference room.

18 NEWS THE UCSD GUARDIAN MONDAY, APRIL 5, 2004 

Athletics: Presidential candidates debate scholarships, Division I 
conrinued from page 3 

Department plan to vote together 
on Library Walk on April 5 at 
noon in a show of support for the 
candidates. TAC chair Hillary 
Mills said she hopes that 300 to 
400 athletes will vote. 

In the first debate, Warwick 
spoke unopposed, as Students 
First! candidate Ryan Potts did 
not attend the debate . 
Responding to questions asked by 
representatives of the Triton 
Athletics Council, Warwick cited 
his experience as director of 
Triton Tide, as a member of the 
Athletic Funding Task Force, and 
as a sPOrtS writer for the UCSD 
GUllrdian. Warwick outlined his 
plan to build a larger fan base for 
UCSD athletics, increase alumni 
support and target freshmen in 
bui lding up support. Warwick 
noted that increas ing school spirit 
now would translate into more 
alumni support in the future. 

"'he bigges t factor in how 
involved an alumnus i , is how 
involved they were when they 

were on campus," Warwick said. 
"So what I'm looking to· do is 
build this next class of alumni 
that's going to want to come back 
to campus. If you don't believe in 
your campus and love your cam-
pus when you're there, four years 
later your feelings aren't going to 
change." 

Warwick also pledged to fight 
for UCSD athletics in the A.S. 
Counci l if elected. 

"I will fight for athletics 
because that's what J care about," 
Warwick said. "I don't care about 
a whole lot of things that will be 
on the A.S. agenda, but I do care 
about athletics." 

In the second debate, presiden-
tial candidates Jeremy Cogan of 
the Unity slate, independent 
Steve York, Harish Nandagopal of 
the Students First! slate and inde-
pendent candidate Jenn Pae 
debated potential scholarships for 
athletes, methods to cope with 
projected budget cutS and meth-
ods to increase suppOrt for UCSD 
athletics from students, faculty 

_ .... ..-ITsm 

and administration. Independent 
candidate Kris Saradpon did not 
participate. 

On the issue of compensating 

" 
Despite a well,..infarmed 
Unity candidate, ] enn 

Pae ultimately earned the 
endorsement ... with her 
visibility and dedication to 
the athletic community. " 

- 'Diton AIhIedcs Council 

for the projected eight-to- l2-per-
cent nudget cuts to the athletics 
department, Pae proposed to 
increase fundrai sing efforts, lobby 
businesses and examine the possi-
bility of allocating funding in the

~ 

A.S. budget. Cogan also stressed 
the importance of fundraising, 
lobbying the California Collegiate 
Athletics Association and looking 
into additional funding sources. 
Nandagopal proposed to raise 
money through donations and 
pass another fee referendum in 
the fall quarter, while recognizing 
that no method would make up 
completely for the shortfall. York 
suggested increasing the lobbying 
power of the campus by breaking 
down the barriers between liberals 
and conservatives and forging a 
consensus. . 

None of the candidates 
believed that scholarships could be 
offered in the near future, but did 
propose long-term plans to 
increase the acceptance of athlet-
ics atUCSD. 

York suggested that students 
get to know their professors on an 
individual basis and force the issue 
to the faculty . . Nandagopal called 
for a srudent referendum to allow 
the use of scholarships, which a 
previous referendum prohibits, 

and look to change the view of the 
academic senate. Cogan stressed 
the importance of working with 
the CCM to extend UCSD schol-
arship exemption until scholar-
ships could be offered and pledged 
to establish a task force and begin 
planni.Ag for offering athletic 
scholarships five-to-IO years in the 
future. . 

In addition to proposing schol-
arships in the future, Pae also sug-
gested that athletes could be sup-
ported in different ways, citing 
other universities' programs to pay 
for athletes' textbooks'. 

All of the candidates also 
pledged to increase support for 
UCSD athletics. N~ndagopal 
argued that involving more cam-
pus organizations is the key, while 
Pae and Cogan suggested working 
through the A.S. Council. York 
proposed that UCSD athletics 
increase marketing through 
SR1V, which ' serves over 6,000 
students on campus.

Cyn City: 
Petca offers 

an ald--school 
feeling 

continued from page ~ of 
The game between our team 

and Point Loma Naurene was the 
fint day game ever played at Petco. 
It was fun watching the two teams 
take the field just like the hig lea-
guers do. The game turned out to 
be an awesome pitcher's duel with 
the Tritons winnin& it, 2-1. Right-
hander Byron Grubman pitched an 
incredible complete game against 
Point Loma, leading his team to 
the historic win. I got a chance to 
walk on the field and chat with him 
for a bit after the ballgame. I asked 
him what it felt like being out 
there. 

"It was awesome to play here 
and win here," Grubman said. "I 
tried to act like I've been here 
before [to ease the nerves) and the 
atmosphere definitely helped our 
team win." 

I also got a chance to talk to 
catcher Jeff Riddle and got his 
thoughts on his Petco Park experi-
ence. 

"Playing here was awesome," he 
said. "I was a little bit nervous, but 
I had a lot of fun . It was definitely 
inspirational to play and win here. 
And someday, it'd be nice to come 
bad, and play here as a big lea-
guer." 

1 can definitely see that happen-
ing.

Men's tennis loses two in a row 
UCSD loses to St. Mary's, UC Santa Cruz 
By CYNTHIA BLADE CHAVEZ 

Sports Editor 

The UCSD men's tennis team, 
ranked fifth in Division II, suffered 
twO losses in its Northern 
California road trip against St. 
Mary's on April 2 and UC Santa 
Cruz on April 3. The team lost 5-2 
against Division I St. Mary's and 4-
3 against Division III UC Santa 
Cruz. 

In the St. Mary's match up, the 
Tritons lost two of three doubles 
matches to give the Gaels an early 
1-0 lead. At No.1 doubles, junior 
Bryan Swatt and senior Amir Nejad 
lost to Martin Marechal and Andre 
Scion, 8-4, while senior Jeff Wilson 
and freshman Seth Spector lost, 8-
6, at No.3 doubles to Rafael Lopez 
and Adam Fauvre. The lone dou-
bles win was at No.2, with senior 
Nick Morton and sophomore 
Brent Molden squeezing out an 8-3 
win over J.J . Whitlinger and 
Vincent LeBorgne. 

Dawid Ung/GucItdim file 
Double trouble: Bryan Swatt (left) and Amir Nejad lost their doubles matches 
on April 2 and April 3 against Division I Sl Mary's and Division III UC Santa Cruz. 

UCSD continued to struggle in 
singles and lost two of five matches, 
with Molden and Spector snagging 
a win apiece in straight sets. 
Molden defeated Lopez, 7-6 (7-3), 
7-5, and Spector defeated 
Whitlinger, 6-1, 7-5. Meanwhile, 
Swatt, Wilson, Novak and Nejad 
lost their singles matches. This win 

was the Gaels' fourth consecutive 
victory and improved their record 
to 11-6 overall. 

The Tritons hoped to turn 
things around in the next match, 
but ran into a red-hot UC Santa 
Cruz team, which had won six 
matches in a row. The Banana 
Slugs are ranked fifth in Division 
ill and are sitting atop the West 
Region.

to take an early 1-0 lead. The 
Tritons battled back in singles play, 
but could not get the match-clinch-
ing win in their 4-3 loss. 

At No. 1 singles, Swatt lost the 
first set to Brian Casey and staged a 
comeback to win, 4-6, 6-4, 6-4. At 
No. 3 singles, Wilson defeated 
Shane Templeman, 6-1, 6-3, and at 
No.4, Brent Molden dropped the 
first set before coming back and 
winning a three-set battle against 
Matthew Brunner, 4-6, 6-3 , 6-2. 
Nejad, Novak and Spector lost 
their singles matches. This victory 
improves the Banana Slugs' record 
to 20-4. 

The two defeats put UCSD at 
12-8 overall. Despite their losses, 
however, the Tritons have been 
playing solid tennis lately, illustrat-
ed by a huge jump in Division IT 
ranlcings from No. 13 to No.5. 
The team played its next match on 
April 4 against Fresno State. 
Complete results were unavailable 
at press time.

MulO'( 1IoJmN//GooIflan file 
Blanked: UCSD was simply no match for top-ranked BYU-Hawaii at the 
University of West Rorida Invitational on April 2. 

B,ANGELA UN 
Staff Writer 

On April 2, the UCSD women's 
tennis team fell to No. 1 BYU-
Hawaii in an overwhelming 9-0 
loss on the first day of the 
Universiry of West Florida 
Invitational in Pensacola, Fla. 

The Tritons were unable to fend 
off undefeated BYU-Hawaii in 
doubles, earning only three games 
in all of the doubles matches. In sin-
gles, the ladies did not fare much 
better: the only Triton not to lose in 
straight sets was No.3 sophomore 
Tara Siddiqui. Siddiqui played an 
extraordinary match against 25th-
ranked Anna Lewis, Siddiqui was 
able to win the first set, 6-4, and 
then lost the second set, 4-6, before 

losing the tie-breaker, 5-10. 
The defeat pots the Tritons' 

overall season record at 12-7 with 
two matches remaining to be 
played against No.4 West Florida 
and No. 13 Delta State University

in the tournament. This was the 
second straight loss for the Tritons. 

On March 31, the Tritons lost 
to No. 21 Hawaii-Hilo in a close 6-
3 match. The Tritons headed into 
the singles line-up with a 2-1 lead, 
due to big wins from No. 2 doubles 
Siddiqui and freshman Kristin 
Bronowiclci, and No. 3 doubles, 
sophomores Allison Ishii andJenna 
Ishii. 

Siddiqui and Bronowicki beat 
their opponents, 8-4, while th,e Ishii 
sisters defeated Dorothee Beauvir 
and TIana Lum-Tucker, 8-3. 

Unfortunately, the Tritons only 
picked-up one match in the singles 
line-up, as junior Jasmin Dao 
impressiyely took Michiko Tanaka in 
a quick 6-2, 6-2 match. Siddiqui was 
able to we her opponent to three 
sets after losing the first, 3 -6, then 
winning the second, 6-3, and finally 
losing the last set, 6-4, 

The Tritons will face Cal State 
San Bernardino and league oppo-
nent Point Lorna Nazarene before 
hosting the CCAA Championship 
on April 16 and April 17.

trolled the majority of the action, 
but the Tritons looked constantly 
poised to level the match, grab-
bing a late lead at 27-26. 
Unfortunately, the menace of 
serving errors from April 2 came 
back to plague UCSD yet again as 
the Cougars rallied down the 
stretch to win, 31-29. 

Game two featured 21 ties and 
more tight action, the underdog 
Tritons hanging with the favored 
BYU ream. The teams combined 
for 40 kills and 15 errors in a 
high-flying battle that ended in a 
36-34 BYU victory only after the 
Cougars successfully defended 
against three Triton game point 
attempts . 

A deflated UCSD side had little 
lefr in game three and was finished 
off 30-22 by the Cougars for the 
sweep. 

With just three matches left in 
MPSF conference play, the Tritons 
have no hope of reaching the play-
offs, so they are forced to look for 
other motivations. 

"Our focus is mostly pride and 
playing for the seniors," Urton 
said. 

Waller, one of the seniors, 
came up with a huge rebound per-

formance in the second BYU 
match after tallying just two kill s 
in the first contest and making 
eight errors. Waller finished hi s 
April 3 performance with 20 kills 
and five digs, and even managed 
w lead the team in blocks with 
five. Waller now needs JUSt 37 kills 
in the Triwns' final four ma tches 
to break the UCSD all-time 
career kills record of 1,268. He 
says he uses the record for motiva-
tion. 

"I thinlc about it when I'm out 
there," Waller said. "It's in my 
mind without a doubt, especially 
now that our team goals are not 
nearly as prominent. It'd just be 
something thats nice to have for 
me. I'm really trying to break it 
Senior Night at home, so I'm real-
ly going for that because breaking 
it on the road wouldn't mean as 
much." 

The record watch will contin-
ue as the Tritons close out their 
home schedule with matches 
against UC Santa Barbara, Cal 
State Northridge and California 
Baptist April 9, April 10 and April

A historic 
afternoon 
at Petco 

Park 

Cyn City 
Cyn~hia Blade Chavez 

I know I stress over being a sports editor with deadlines, finding the right information, 
dealing with computer problems as 
well as every little complication 
possible that seems to reveal itself 
during production. But on March 
13, it was good to be sports edi tor. 
The GUIlrdian was lucky enough to 
be invited to cover Tony Gwynn's 
SDSU Aztec Invitational at Petco 
Park from March 12 through 
March IS. Luckily, my baseball 
beat writer and I were able to score 
some press passes that gave us 
access to the press box, dugout and 
field . We even scored some free 
food and got a chance to roam 
:lfound the whole park, inside and 
out, with no one even questioning 
us. 

My writer and I began our day 
with a bit of an adventure. I figured 
that taking the trolley (which I 
have never done before) would be 
the easiest way to get to Petco. We 
drove to the Old Town trolley sta-
tion and ran into orne problems 
finding a parking spot. After a lot 
of circling around, we found a 
parking spot a couple of blocks 
away and finally made our way 
onto the trolley. Taking the trolley 
was really easy, although I had 
heard that the trolley had been 
overcrowded the night before 
when SDSU played at Petco Park 
to start the Invitational. It seems 
that the San Diego fans are going 
to have a hell of a time trying to 
find parking during baseball sea-
son. 

We finally reached the ball-
park, and if you haven't seen it 
already, it's, situated at the heart of 
the Gaslamp Quarter. Once I 
stepped inside, I was in awe. It 
was overwhelming. I could see a 
breathtaking view of the city sky-
line behind the outfield wall and 
out in left field was an old brick 
warehouse with a Western Metal 
Supply Company sign on it. The 
seats were concentrated, giving a 
more intimate feel to the overall 
atmosphere. Even in the nose-
bleed sections it looks and feels 
like you are a lot closer than, say, 
the nosebleeds at Qualcomm 
Stadium. I felt like I was at a sta-
dium back East. The ballpark is 
definitely worth all the' parking 
hassles. 

There were a few thousand 
people on hand, walking around 
and watching the game between 
UCSD and Point Lorna 
Nazarene. I walked all over, 
checking the view from all possi-
ble angles, and chatted with a few 
of the fans. There were scores of 
little kids with their parents and I 
even ran across a couple of kids 
playing hooky from school to get 
a chance to check out the ball-
park. 

"[Petco Park] is very cool," 10-
year-old Zachary Craven said. "My 
favorite part is center field and I 
also like the french fries - they're 
very good."

Volleyball blasted back-to-back by No. 1 BYU 
Tritons play Cougars close, but can't win more than one game 

By MARK MALONE 
Senior Staff Writer 

Although the UCSD men 's 
volleyball team was able to hang 
tough with the top team in the 
nation, the Tritons fell in back-to-
back home matches against the 
Cougars of Brigham Young 
University on April 2 and April 3. 
Although UCSD was able to take 
a game from BYU on April 2, the 
Cougars won their school record . 
19th and 20th consecutive match-
es as the Tritons extenqed their 
losing streak to four, bringing 
their record to 7-18 overall and 3-
16 in the Mountain Pacific Sports 
Federation. 

Before a season-high home 
crowd of 612 on April 2, UCSD 
failed to come out playing well, 
and allowed BYU to hit .800 in the 
opening frame. The Tritons went 
down hard, 30-22, and were in an 
early hole. 

UCSD managed to stay closer 
in game two, keeping things tied 
at 16-16, until the Cougars put 
together a three-point run to take 
control of the match. With a 30-
26 win, BYU looked completely in 
control. 

The Cougars started fast with a 
7 -1 run to open the third game, 
but the Tritons refused to roll over 
as UCSD head coach Ron Larsen 
brought in freshman Brooks 
Dierdorff to take over the setting 
responsibilities. The team 
responded immediat,ely and the 

Tritons charged back to level the 
game at 14-14. A subsequent run 
on sophomore outside hitter Jeff 
Urton's serve gave UCSD a 19-16 
cushion and a lead it would not 
relinquish. Relying heavily on 
junior outside hitter Adam Toren, 
who powered the Tritons with 10 
of his match-high 20 kills in game 
three, UCSD picked up the 30-28 
win. 

Game four was once again 
competitive as the two sides bat-
tled, but with the score level at 11 
apiece, BYU rattled off a five-
point run to take control of the 
match and secure the 3-1 victory 
with a 30-26 win. 

The Cougars outblocked the 
Tritons 12.5-2 and outhit UCSD 
by .500 to .300, but the biggest 
problem in the box score for the 
Tritons was the 26 service errors 
they committed. 

"We missed way too many 
serves to try to win this match," 
Larsen said. "There are certain 
indicators of success in volleyball 
- of winning and losing - and 
the most important indicator is 
killing the ball, but almost equal-
ly important is not missing 
serves." 

Although Larsen was critical of 
his team's serving, he praised his 
squad's resiliency. 

"It's good that we battled. We 
could have mailed it in after game 
two," Larsen said. 

The players also took positives

No. 10 baseball drops three in Davis 
Tritons overwhelmed by league-leading Aggies 

Lanthier not 
asked back as 
headcoaach By COURTNEY FIELD 

Senior Staff Writer 
After a prosperous 7 -2 home 

stand March 13 through March 
28, the Division 11 No. 10 
UCSD baseball team took to ' 
the road April 2 through April 4 
to take on California Collegiate 
Athletic Association leaders UC 
Davis. The Tritons' solid play 
was interrupted by the Aggies 
as they dropped game one, 7-4, 
game two, 6-3, and game three, 
4-3, of the four-game series 
against UC Davis. Game four 
was still in progress at press 
time. 

With the losses, UCSD falls 
to 25-15 overall and 15-12 in 
the CCAA. The Aggies are inel-
igible for post-season play due 
to their gradual transition to 
Division I. The Tritons had 
won 10 of their last 12 games 
before the series with Davis, 
including a 10-2 victory over 
Vanguard University on March 
31. 

The Aggies jumped on the 
Tritons early in the series open-
er. UC Davis center fielder 
Robby Tulk opened the bottom 
of the first inning with a triple to 
right field. The Aggies pushed 
across three runs in the inning 
and added two more in the bot-
tom of the fourth off of a two-
run homer by T uJk. 

The Tritons put up a run in 
the top of the fourth inning 
after senior catcher Jeff Riddle 
smacked a double to left-center 
field. Riddle's double scored 
UCSD junior shortstop Keith 
Hernandez, who had singled up 
the middle earlier in the same 
inning. 

Down 7-1 through seven

innings, the Tritons mounted a 
three-run rally in the top of the 
ninth, but it was enough to 
overtake the Aggies. UCSD 
sophomore center fielder 
Damian Fante's single to center 
field drove in two of the three 
runs in the inning. 

UC Davis held on to earn 
the victory over the Tritons, 7-
4. Aggie pitcher Michael Potter 
went 8.2 innings and earned the 
victory. He improved to a per-
fect 5 -0 on the season with the 
Win. 

ucsq sophomore pitcher 
Byron Grubman went seven 
innings, giving up seven runs on 
13 hits and striking out four 
Aggie batters. Grubman fell to 
3-3 with the loss. 

Tulk, the Aggies leadoff bit-

ter, went 2-for-5 with two RBI 
and two runs scored. He blasted 
a two-run home run in the 
fourth inning, his seventh of the 
season, and had a triple to open 
the game. Aggie first baseman 
Lukas Kirby and right fielder 
Kyle Irving each added three 
hits, with Kirby scoring twice. 
Second. baseman Brandon 
Oliver was 2-for-4 with a triple, 
a run and an RBI. 

For UCSD, Riddle was 2-for-
4 with a run-scoring double in 
the fourth. Fante drove in a pair 
of runs with a ninth-inning sin-
gle and made eight putouts in 
the field.

Edwards wants high 
profile basketball 

program for U~SD 
By MATTHEW GRANT 

Associate Sports Editor 

After 10 seasons as head coach 
of the UCSD men's basketball 
team, Greg Lanthier will not ~ve 
his contract renewed for the 2004-
05 season. The Trito\1S ended the 

, 2003-04 season with a 9-18 overall 
record and 9-11 in California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
play. 

"It is time for us to go in a new 
direction," said UCSD Director of 
Athletics Earl W. Edwards on 
March 10. 

Since Lanthier's first game as 
head of the Triton squad in 1994, 
he has earned a 111-149 overall 
record, and the program moved 
from Division m to Division II 
during the 2000-01 season. His 
most successful season was 1998-
99, when UCSD earned a 20-5 
record. 

Edwards suggested that the 
chanre may be the first step in 
devefoping UCSD into a more 
competitive basketball school. 

"Basketball needs to be a high-
profile span and we will be looking 
for I Person. preferably with head-
coaching experience, who can 
build on the foundation we have in 
place," Edwards said.
