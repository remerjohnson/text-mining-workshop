By Mary Higgins 
Associate News Editor 

More than 100 people gathered 
at The Hump at noon on Thur day , 
in support of the week-long Asso-
ciation of Student Employees (ASE) 
trike. 

"We all know why we' re here," 
graduate student Anthony Navarrete 
said. "We feel we hould have some 

voice in issues of our employment ." 
Several speaker rallied the group 

with pro-union peeches and cri ti -
cisms of the administration and 
media. 

"When pu h comes to shove the 
university is willing to sacrifice [us] 
to balance our budget," Navarrete 
aid. 

A.S. Vice President of External 
Affairs Alex Tom said that he was 
"frustrated with higher education in 
general" and lauded the recent A.S. 
resolution that urges undergradu-
ates to upport and participate in the 

END OF THE ROAD 

trike. 
"We need to defcnd ourselvcs," 

Tom said. "I' m kind of beyond an-
ger ... I'm rcady." 

As the procession passed Centcr 
Hall , on-Iookcrs stood on the balco-
nics and in doorways to watch the 
protest. 

At theend of the rally, ASE mem-
ber and TA for the Department of

mareh across campus. 

Marcher blocked two lanes of 
traffic as they hcaded north on 
Gilman Dr. to the Library Walk -

UCSD Charter School Set to Open in Fall 1997 
OPPORTUNITIES: 
Students can get 
involved through PAL 
By Christina Rhudy 
Staff Writer 

Marshall College Provost and 
Charter School Steering Committee 
Chair Cecil Lytle hosted a forum 
last Friday to discuss the planned 
UCSD Charter High School and 
ways students can get involved in 
the project before the school's sched-
uled opening in fall 1997. 

Iniiial planning for the school 
began in July 1992 when the Cali-

fomiaStateSenatepa sedS.B. I448, 
the Charter School Act. UCSD be-
gan informal di scu sions with local 
officials concerning the project in 
winter 1993. 

According to the school 's mis-
ion statement, a main goal f the 

project is to "provide an intensive 
college-preparatory environment for 
low-income and other historically 
under-represented student popula-
tions at the University of Califor-
nia." 

The school will be a public high 
school on the UCSD campus, and 
students will use UCSD classrooms 
and faci Iities. 

According to project coordina-
tors, the school'scurriculum is based 
on three principles - excellent 
teacher ,small classes and a trong 
curriculum. 

Administrators plan to conduct a 
nationwide search for teachers who 
are experienced in their fields and 
have experience working with low-
income student . 

Based upon the belief that pupils 
azchieve more with more direct at-
tention from teachers, administra-
tors are planning to limit class sizes. 
Class size will be limited to no more 
than 15 students, and up to 15 UCSD 
students will serve as tutors in each 

c1as . 
Classes will be held in two-hour 

blocks Monday through Saturday 
mornings, and will focu mainly on 
instruction in the University of Cali-
fornia "A-F" required courses. 

UCSD student-tutors will work 
with individual charter- chool tu-
dents to ensure their understanding 
of the material. 

According Lytle, the chool's 
tudents "will not arrive with ninth-

grade kills in subjects like reading 
and math" and the UCSD students 
will make vital contribution to the 
program.

PINION 

REE 
Confining the scope of free 
expression is not only wrong but it will 
fail to eliminate the actions and words 
that society finds morally objectionable 
., M..tl Peekowitz 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

Freedom of speech is perhaps our most 
cherishe<l right. Maybe this is simply because 
it is featured so early on in the Bill of Rights. 
Maybe it is because the media rely so heavi -
lyon it, and their preferences influence us all. 
Mpre likely. it is because free speech is a-
right exercised more orten than the other 
rights enumerated in the Constitution. 

While people of all political ideologies 
value freedom of speech. many also seem 
equally willing to attack it. From both the 
right and the leli come attempts to limit what 
we can say. publish or read. Though the argu-
ments sound diflerent from each direction -
"sensitivity" from the left. "decency" from 
the right - they all boil down to the same 
thing: "You can express yourself freely. pro-
vided we aprove of what you are saying." 

T~se attacks by the right arc consistent ly 
fought by groups such as the Amaerican Ci vi I 
Liberties Union and are generally defeated in 
coun. (witness the defeat of the 
Communications Decency Act). 
Unfortunately. similar attack ' from the left 
encounter lillie oposition. They argue for 
restrictions on speech and expression in order 
to prevent the creation of a "hostile environ-
men\." Most disturbing is the fact that Ihis 
argument has been most 'Successful ilt un·iver-
sities, the ostensible bastions of intellectual 
freedom. 

Freedom of speech is not and cannot be 
absolute. The classic example of unprotect-
ed speech is shouting 'lire' in a crowded 
movie house. Fraud and slander are 
not protected forms of free speech. 
And some speech for which minors may 
not he inlellectually prepared does not 
enjoy absolute pl'O\ection. 

But some other kinds of objection-
ahle speech indeed need protection. This 
!legs the question. "Why must we protect 
these objectionable works"" Protecting 
works such as Tire Catcher in lire Rye or 
da.~sical nude sculplure is importaqt. but 
not dillicult from a legal standpoint. The 
threats to such works are nOl likely to go far. 
Defending that which we do not like - Ihat 
speech which !ia:mS to have no value - is. 
more ditlicult. more thankless and therelore 
more necessary. 

The Firsl Amendment wa~ intended to 
secure the funct ioning of dem<x:racy by guar-
anteeing the freedom to expres,~ poli tical 
thought without the fear of prosecution. It 
has. not utveasonably, bo..-cn c~lendcd to 
hroadly cover anistic expression as well. Its 
purpose, though, is primarily political. A 

broader notion of free speech is important, 
however. we do not want merely to be able to 
discuss the weighty issue of Ihe day freely, 
but also whatever else we are thinking. 

The most common philosophical 
approach to frec peech is a slippery slope 
argument . Once we restrict some speech, 
where do we stop? And what happens if 
someone you disagree with comes to power 
after you have set the precedent of restricting 
speech'? The problem with the slippery slope 
argument is that it is. well. logically slippery. 
It says nothing aboul thc inherent wrongness 
of restricting expression. only about restrict-
ing the "good" expression. This is like argu-
ing Ihat dictatorship is OK as long as the 
good guys arc in charge. 
. There is, however. a beller rea')()n for free 

expression - the importance of freedom 
itselr. There are no statistics to SUppOI1

PEECH 
Narrow restrictions on the First 

Amendment do not infringe upon the 
right of free speech and are necessary 

to protect people from hurtful actions 
By AIIMI'I Schlick 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

Limiting the First Amendment right to 
free speech docs not necessarily violate that 
right. In order to ensure a minimal sense of 
order and harmony in society. it is necessary 
thai we regulate speech that would incite a 
riot, endanger the president or in some way 
damage others. This isn't just speech that is 
merely controversial (such as buming the 
American flag) , but speech that genui nely 
harms other people. Pornography, ethnic and 
racial slurs and other forms of expression 
that harm members of our society are cxam-
ples of this kind of speech - speech that 
should not receive First Amendment protec-
tion. 

Many people seem to think that racial 
slurs and pornography 

have no 

effect on minorities or women, but pornog-
raphy may have an indirect effect on society. 
Indeed, the prevalence of pornography and 
sexual images in America has been used in 
at least one coun ea e (Rabidue v. Osceola 
Refining Co.) a clear. direct evidence that 
pornography can lead to irresponsible sexu-
al behavior. Likewise, racial slurs and other 
forms of racism are widespread and orten go 
unnoticed unless a church is bombed or 
police hrutality is aired on television. But it 
seems absurd to claim that we cannot take 
action against abusive speech just because 
such abuse is sufficiently institutionalized in 
our society. 

Nevertheless, many deny Ihe harmful 
effects of pornography and racial slurs. 
They believe that pomography cannot be 
blamed for t~e actions of the people that 
view it, and that the people who act irre-
sponsibly after viewing it should be pun-
ished. notlhe company that publishes the lit-
erature. However, Ihe problem should be 
solved by limiting object from which the 
action stemmed. Only this will effectively 
eliminate immoral and illegal actions and 
words that result from the influence of 
pornography. 

Hate speech in the [onn of pornography 
may be lhoughtlo be harmless by ilS perpe-
trator because he assumes the pornograph-
ic lilerature is representative of society, 
but 10 those on the receiving end il is 
hateful. dangerous and damaging. 

Pornography results in genu ine 
harm to others. It is one of the largest 
mdustries in the nation and is directed 
primarily at men. It is harmful to women 
because it systematically portrays 
women as nothing more than objects of 

sexual desire. which results in the presen-
tation of a very warped. damaging and 

demeaning view of women in particular and 
of sexual relationship in general. This 
warped view is hurtful to women because it 
encourages phenomena such as date rape. 

Placing reasonable limits on free speech 
does not lead us into questioning whether 
it's possible for any expression (no matter 
how common) to be offensive to anyone. 
Rather, it leads us to consider whether 

systematic discrimination should go 
unnoticed. If all people were 

equals, pornography wouldn't 
really be a problem. If people 
were robots and didn't have 
psyches malleable by hurtful 

pecch. then slurs - demeaning 
representations of others - wouldn't be

COMMENTARY: The proposal to trim back on information, reference and periodical desk hours flies in the face of 
library priorities and will frustrate p~trons by preventing them from fully utilizing the library's resources 

LIBRARY CUTBACKS WILL HURT STUDENTS 
., ..... -. 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

What would most students at 
UCSD consider the single most 
important academic re ource avail-
able to them on campus? 

To get a quick feel for the 
answer 10 this question, I look an 
informal survey of the people in my 
building. I was very surprised at the 
answers J received. They ranged 
from the Internet. to the faculty. to 
the diversity of our campus com-
munity. This might seem strange to 
students at many other universities 
because, traditionally, the answer to 
this question wou ld be the library. 

In a recent news article 
("Library Considers Trimmi ng 
Desk Hours." Guardian. Nov. II ), 
the Guardian reported that 
UCSD's library administration is 
considering proposals to cut back 
on "Cadillac" levels of service that 
have been provided to students in 
the pas\. Among the proposed cuts 
are closures of the reference and 
periodicals desks during evenings

and weekends and the closure of 
the information desk during week-
days. 

Six areas were cited in a docu-
ment released by Universily 
Librarian Gerald Lowell as "pro-
grammatic priorities" for the 
libraries here at UCSD: maintain-
ing current acquisi tion levels; sup-
porti ng the propo ed UC Digital 
Library; increasing education, out-
reach and user upport programs; 
integrating internal library financial 
system with existing campus-wide 
systems; increasing library hours; 
and bolstering existing fundraising 
efforts. 

While the "Programmatic 
Priorities Document," which is 
avai lable to any student who asks a 
librarian for a copy, does not clear-
ly indicate that the priorities of the 
library administration lost touch 
with the needs and wants of Ihe stu-
dent body a closer look at the ideas 
going into the implementation of 
these priorities suggests OIherwi e. 

First of all, the admi nistration is

looking to cut costs by completely 
closing the information desk. As far 
as most student are concerned, the 
information desk is the single most 

valuable "education. outreach and 
user support" resource anywhere in 
the library. Amazingly. since the 
first few weeks of Ihis quarter, no 
library orientations have been held 
to familiarize students with 
research methods or the resourees 
available at the various facilities. 
The administration hopes to meet 
Ihese kinds of needs by combining 
the information desk with the refer-
ence desk. 

This can only result in disaster. 
The function of each of these desks 
is sharply delined and drastically 
differenl. People wi II get f rustnued 
waiting in line to lind out where. 
for example. another library is 
located, while the student ahead of 
them is stumping the librarian with 
a question about some obscure, out-
of-print periodical. The people. not 
computers. providing assistance at 
the library is easily its mo t impor-
tant allribute. 

Perhaps for librarian and 
library administrators, books rcally 
are easier to work with than people. 

That would be one eltplanation for 
why the reference and information 
de k hours are to be cuI. Another 
explanation for these culs might be 
that students don't generally use the 
librarics at night and on weekcnds. 
so the services provided then would 
be going to serve the community 
rather than students. 

If library administrators were 
around during Ihose hours more 
often. I'm sure they wouldn't think 
so. I spend at least three nights a 
week at the library. usually until 
closing. I know that many of my 
friends do as well. I hardly ever see 
anyone older than 25 when I'm at 
the li brary during those times. 
CUlling evening and weekend desk 
hours will have more of an effect 
on students than on any other group 
thai uses the library . 

It seems inconsistent to make 
these kinds of cuts while keeping 
"increasing library hours" a priori-
ty. The early closing hours for the 
librarics on campus is the single

But hurtful speech like pomog-
raphy is a problem. There is a clear 
link between pomography and date 
rape. Allhough date rape is different 
from the w mmon idea of being 
raped in a back alley, it is still a 
cri minal phenomenon. What makes 
il more insidious than traditional 
rape is that il is more commonly 
reinforced by si lence. 

Male prerogatives in the justice 
system especia lly enforce thi s

And leftist critics of so-called "hate

majority of Americans that such 
expression directly contributes to an

At any rate, as a practical matter, 
restrictions on free peech fail to 
accomplish their aims. George

guage in controlling tboughts, mak-
ing Newspeak a kcy element in the 
anti-utopia of hi s classic novel, 
1984.

Limits on free speech are a eon-
slitulional method to remedy per-

ry views against individuals and 
classes In society. Also, if women 
were a substanlial part of the deci-
sion-making process in how they 
arc portrayed then the equal trcat-
ment test would be met. . 

Restrictions on hateful speech 
and pornography arc not violations 
of Ihe First Amendment righl to 
free expression. Rather, they arc a 
necessary re ponse to very real 
allacks against women and minori-
ties. The time has come when we 
must takc a stand against these 
abuses of rights. 

If all of us could look in the mir-
ror and think about others for a

ed means of expression, we would 
be on our way to a more mature,

racism, misogyny and other preju-
dice is a disgusting fact in today's 
society. But restricting free expres-
sion is not the way to fight it. The 
best way to deal with bigots is 10 
ignore them. 

Every time the KKK marches, 
the media cover it, and the Klan gets 
free publicity. What would happen 
if we ignored them? They would 
march, no one would pay altention, 
eventually they would realize that 
people were not getting upset, and 
they would go home disappointed. 
When the decent people get worked 
up over the idiocy of the bigots, we 
legitimize them. We give them what 
they want. They arc not worthy of 
our time or consideration. 

An even more aggressive

approach is to take the bigots'taunts 
and embrace rather than light them. 
As comedian Lenny Bruce would 
point out, if President Kennedy 
would just talk about the "nigger" 
he had lunch with today, and every-
one would just use it and accept it, 
the word would lose all its power. 
Hateful words only have power 
because we allow them to. 

I! would be comforting to be able 
te, cbse with a simple appeal to the 
kindergarten lesson about sticks and 
stones, but unfortunately names can 
hurt. What, then, do we do about it? 
Politically, we might be able to get 
away with restricting certain forms 
of exprcssion, but to do so would be 
both ineffective and wrong. We 
must be better than that.

Guy specifica lly sees himself as a 
person who gets taken advantagc

guys must deal with all sorts of 
abuse, whether it is intentional or 
not, and then when Ihey complain, 
people tell them not to whine. 

As if il weren'l unfortunale

he also is the one left without the

up a a fall -back for someone who

Ihe ripped-looki ng RIMAC Iype

Admilledly, this a slereotype,

Mr. Suave. They resent Mr. Suave

they're looking for action. 

"'Girlsl always go for the guys 
who move fasl," Bob said. ''(' m

Bob said he 'd been duped by 
Mr. Suave before, but his inilial

"Life isn ' t fair;' Bob said. "You 
can't change it." 

Another friend of mine - a

fits somewhere between the nice 
and suave catego:ies, and has f ali -
en for Mr. Suave before. 

"He was the biggest nirt and

hearts," Alice explained. "Prior to 
our getting logelher I thought he 
was a jerk. Then he decided he 
liked me and his charm was work-
ing overtime." 

Alice said Mr. uave used his 
charm to eventua lly seduce her. He 
boughl her expensive girts, show-
ered her with altention and was 
generally on his best behavior. 

"Everyone was lalking ahout 
how much he changed and how

that of their physical counterparts. 

While it was not practical to 
improve the electronic resources 
available this year because of the 
continued spending cuts, electronic 
materials will grow to be an effec-
tive solution to decreased funding. 
The day in which paper books are

"Normally I stress about every-
thing I ay to [a girl], but thi s time 
it' s different," Bob aid . "She 
accepts me the way I am." 

It makes perfect sense for Nice 
People to date each other. Who 
else is more likely to apprec iate, 
and less likely to take advantage 
of, a Ni ce Person's generous 
nature? 

However, it doesn' t always 
work out that way. Even Nice

o!Jsly anyone who spends the timc 
to eKpress his opinion in a written 
format. In addition, you can talk to 
the administra ti on at your college, 
in college I.:ouncil meetings for 
eKample. 

Last, hut not least, make sure to 
spread the nc v~ about the proposed 
cuts and tell your fri ends what they 
could mean to ~ t udents us ing the 
library. Tell them to visit the sug-
gestion bOK, too. There isn' t much

make sure your voice is hea rd. 

don't stick up for themselves. Nice 
People fes ter in s il ence when 
they' re taken advantage of, grow-
ing increasi ngly bitler with the 
pass ing of time. 

Who wants to date someone 
who lets himself or herself get 
pushed around? Suave people are 
seKY because they walk like they 
know what they' re doing and why 
they ' re doing it. Suave people 
make plans. Suave people take the 
initiative. 

But nice guys and girls can 
learn how to tum heads when they 
walk into a room. Nice people 
shouldn ' t be afraid to market 
themselves a lillie. If you like to 
ride motorcycles, hanglide and go 
rock-climbing on the weekends, go 

who are suave. 
Let ' face it -
suave people are 
magnetic, or else 
they wouldn 't be

For eKample, 
this is what you 
should say: "Hey

thi s weekend. 
You wanna go?" 
But whatever you 
do, don ' t say 
thi s: "Speaking

chance of winning the leading

There i trong evidence to sug-

people to suave-types is not linked 
to good looks and wealth . 1 have 
met plenty of suave people who 
aren' t good-looking or wealthy, yet 
they have a healthy sel f-esteem. 

This seem to be the root of the 
problem. Nice People often have

The urge to just chuck the 

whole Nice Guy/Girl routine is 
tempting . Trust me, [ know. 
Sometime I think it would be 
more fun to tand up in the middle 
of the Price Center and yell , 
"Screw you all , I' ve had it! No 
more Miss Nice Girl!" 

However, nice people need to 
take heart . You, too, can be suave 
without the aid of a funny green 
mask and a cheesy yellow suit. It 
just takes practice.

SCHOOL: Class 
offers credit for 
volunteering 
ContInued from pag. 9 
facilities, including chemistry labs 
and lecture hall , free of charge, 
taki ng them away from paying 
UCSD students. However, a sourcc 
fami li arwith the project who wished 
to remain anonymous said there was 
no cause for concern. 

Project Coordinator Andrew 
Sutherland, a former UCSD student, 
has raised more than $ 120,000 in 
grants for the new choo!. Although 
Sutherland couldn ' l be reaehed for 
comment, the source claimed the 
school "would only start up with 
proper and full funding ." 

Lytlesaid the school is an impor-
tant project because it is possible to 
assess the ideals of a university by 
the items for which it is willing to 
pay. A socially-aware campus will 
not only require its students to be 
proficient in math and the sciences, 
but will also encourage and give 
credit to those students who con-
tribute positively to their communi-
ties, he said. 

UCSD students interested in be-
coming involved with the charter 
school should contact the Partners 
at Learning (PAL) program, a UCSD 
group that sends tutors to various 
schools throughout San Diego 
County . 

UCSD's Teacher Education Pro-
gram offers a class through which 
students interested in volunteering 
with PALcanreeeivecredit fortheir 
work. 

According to UCSD professor 
Karen Holtzman, who teaches the 
class, the central idea of the pro-
gram is that the tutor develops a 
relationship with the tutored child 
that ex tends beyond the classroom 
into social ac ti vi ti es as well . 

In the past, PAL events have 
included field trips to the tephen 
Birch Aquarium at the Sn ipps In · 
Milution of Ocea nography and a 
mock-Olympics.

Creativity is key factor in 
success of Nissan Design 

International of San Diego 
a world leader in the 

automobile-design industry 

The Man and the Idea: Gerry Hirshberg (center) is the 
j)resident of Nissan Design Internationa (NOI) which , 
creates unique cars such as the Gobi-truck prototype ill 
the background. NOI 's studios are located in a 44,000 
square-foot facility (lower left/upper right) the design of 
which is an example of the type of creativity that seems 
to flow from within its walls . 

FEA1l1RES 13 

"G 0 to hell , Lenny." 
Gerry Hirshberg 's initial re-

action to the phone call he 
received on a snowy Detroit day in 1919 
was one of disbelief. To Hirshberg, the ca ll 
seemed more likely to be a practical joke 
by hi s frie nd Len Casello than an actual 
offer. It was si mply too good to be true. 

'The man said. 'Gerry, we are going to 
consider you to be the founding director of 
a creative-design facility to be located any-
where in America - you pick the place, 
hire a taff, design the facility and you'll be 
designing real cars for the real worl?" for 
the world 's fourth-largest auto maker. 

Thus, Ni ssan Desi gn International 
(NDI) was created. Hirshberg and hi s staff 

I I selecled San Diego as 
" was s mp y home of their studios 

too good to be and began work al small

before breaklllg ground 
on their current location 
in 1983. 

said, 'Gerry, 
you are going 

to be the 
director of a 

design facility 
and you'll be 

designing real 
cars for the 

real world. ", 

Hirshberg's motiva-
tions for moving away 
from Detroit were 
numerous, 

"For too long. the 
induslry has been cen-
tered in one ci ty and 
lhat's nOl su<.:h a hea lthy 
deal. Detroit came to 
believe that what made 

sense in Delroit made sense in California 
and Sealtle and Minneapolis and Florida," 
Hirshberg said . "One of the reasons we 
chose California was that there's not such a 
well -defined history or culture in the outh 
of California. We ' re kind of a mi xture of 
everybody's cu lture." 

Hirshberg also. had the unique idea that 
NDI would design other products a well 
as cars, 

"In Detroit, the automobile is consid-
ered something holier than a product."

NISSAN: 
Studio one of only 
two in the world 
Continued from PIC. 13 
Hirshberg explained. "Product 
designers are thought of as 
academics who do dry, intelligent 
stuff - perfect toasters, perfect 
audio components and perfect 
chairs, whereas aUlomobi le 
designers like to think of 
themse lves as people who do 
things with great spirit." 

understanding as to how unique 
this small conglomeration of 49 
people is among an industry of 
gargantuan proportions. 

NDI was Ihe brain child of 
Takashi Ishihara, Nissan 's 
chairman-of-the-board. 

"(Ishihara) recognized thaI.. . 
design i a form of nonverbal 
language," Hirshberg said . "He 
realized that he was selling more 
than half of his producls to people 
speaki ng a foreign visual tongue 
and he wanled to change that" 

The UCSD Guardian 

Today, the world shares 
Hirshberg's excitement as 
Ishihara's brainchild has become 
the Garden of Eden for designers. 

NDI is one of only two Nissan 
design sludios in the world. Its 
sister tudio is located in Japan and 
employs approximalely 400 
designers. NOI , in contrast , 
employs only 49 people but is 
responsible for about 70 percenl of 
the Nissan cars seen on American 
roads. 

FEAnJRES IS 

According to Hirshberg. a car is 
a product. "Its history i as much a 
limiting aspect of it development 
as it is something to honor," he 
said. "So we challenge (Delroit 's 
viewl with the full gamut because I 
love the idea of being ignorant in 
lOIS of fie lds." 

So Ishihara asked 39-year-old 
Hirshberg to establish a de ign 
studio in America - the most 
creative design studio in the world. 
Hirshberg, mired in the "idea 
killing machine" that was Detroit, 
was eager to make the move and 
became the first designer ever to 
vo luntari ly part company with 
General Motors. 

"I nOliced after the first everal 
years that in every compelition 
with the Japanese studio, we made 
one car as the fi nal solution whi Ie 
they made two or three," Hirshberg 
said. "So, I a ked the head of the 
corporation, 'Why do you do thatT 
And he looked at me straight and 

Mark PaIIInIIW Gunian 
UtIle tlkes: NDI takes contracts to design not only cars, but other 
products as well such as these chairs for preschool age chikten. 

With this in mind. Hirshberg 
abandoned Detroit and came west 
to San Diego, eventually settling 
NDI into its current abode, no more 
than a two-minute stroll from 
UCSO's east-parking lot. The NDI 
facility is spacious, with 44,000 
square feet of high-tech gadgetry 
housed in a framework of gla sand 
stone. Beyond Ihe veneer lies a 
company whose unique perspeclive 
on the automotive industry is j ust 
as visionary as th l! numerous 
inventions that are scatlered about 
its halls. 

Looking al the ideas hehind 
NDl's inception provides a better 

"In those days, GM was the 
world 's seventh-largest economic 
entity on the face of the earth and 
when you' re that big, it's hard to 
take creative input from young 
people who think that they know a 
better way," Hirshberg said. 

"One of the great trengths of 
Japan is that it knows what it 
doesn 't know and its not ashamed 
to ask and to use ideas from 
elsewhere. When I fo und ou t that 
there was a cu lture that felt it 
needed to learn some things and 
recognited the ro le of design, I was 
very excited:' 

aid, 'To make it even.' He knew 
that we were in an ideal situation. 
We made a perfect playpen with 
their upport ." 

NOI 's perfect playpen has been 
vi ited by every car-design unit in 
the world. All Japanese and 
American manufacturers, in 
addition to Mercedes, BMW, 
Volkswagen, and Volvo have made 
the pilgrimage. Hirshberg attribute 
the immense success of the 
company to the fact (unlike a 
majorilY of the automoti ve-design 
facilities) that 01 does nOI limit 
it elf to designing cars.

NISSAN: 
Studio product line

ContInued from PICe 15 
available for non-automotive 
design work, and from the very 
outset we got clients from all over 
the world," Hirshberg said. "We 
have never in 17 years had to 
knock on a door." 

NOI has designed ski boots, 
yachts, medical instruments, golf 
clubs, a line of preschool day care 
furniture and tricycles, just to name 
a few of the curious items which 
can be found in glass display cases 
throughout the lobby. While these 
things may seem wholly 
di sconnected from automotive 
design, Hirshberg sees a di tinct 
link between the creative aspects of 
designing all these products. 

"You don't stop a creative 
person," Hirshberg said from his 
perch on one of the several neo-
modem chairs in his office. 

"A creative person doesn't have 
to do one thing at a time. As a 
matter of fact, they ' re usually 
reading two or three books or 
working on two or three works of 
an or projects at a time," he said.

-Gerry Hlrshber, 
President of NOI 

"So, on any de igner's desk at 
anyone time, you can see a wide 
range of products that they are 
working on and the technologies 
and ways of looking at the market 

an interesting way of 
juxtaposing and bringing 
unexpected ideas to others." 

This is far from the only unique 
perspective central to NDI. 
however. In regards to working 
closely with their Japanese 
counterpans, Hirshberg considers 

'. 

The UCSD Guardian 

the language and culture barriers a 
positive influence on the creative 
process. 

He terms it "creative abrasion." 
By his own definition, it is the 
process of using the natural 
abrasion that goes on between 
"different disciplines and cultures 
as a positive creative source of 
energy; rather than si mply 
something that management puts a 
fire hose to, oils and greases and 
makes go away." 

This philosophy is applied 
within the company as well. NDI 
ha made a policy of hiring diverse 
minds, maximizing the possibility 
of creating a new idea. 

Monday, N~vember 15. 1996 

"We hire in pairs and try to 
make each member of the pair as 
divergent from one another as 
possible, 0 we make it as likely as 
possible for there to be unexpected 
juxtapositions," Hirshberg said.

Behind the acenea: Modeler Dean Seymin works meticulously with 
clay to carve out the shape of the cars that will define the future . 

"We have a truly international 
group of folks from Germany, Iran, 
Korea, Canada, and even Texas," 
he added with a chuck le. 

This multi -national crew is 
divided into modelers, designers, 
engineers and yet another 'category 
new to the industry dubbed the 
"design context laboratory." 

According to Hirshberg, this 

"lab" - unlike any other in the 
automotive-design industry -
"informs the designer's intuition." 

One of the purposes of the lab is 
to keep up with the times.

Hirshberg's reason for the specific 
composition of this group is hi s 
aversion to traditional market-trend 
surveys. 

"If you take ideas seriously, you 
take play seriously, because idea-
making is playing around with 
ideas," he said. ''There's a thin 
dividing line between playing 
around with ideas and horsing 
around. We do a lot of that kind of 
thing." 

"What happens in mo t places is 
companies ask people, 'What do 
you want next'?'" Hirshberg said. 
"But, nobody ever asked somebody 
if they wanted a Post-It note. That 
grew out of a different kind of 
mind-set. So, we observe. We 
participate. We invite people in 
with their cars. We visit a lot of 
di fferent cities and we find endless 
ways or tappi ng into peoples unmet 
and unanticipated needs and then 
use innovative thinking and 
intuition to fill them." 

With that in mind, NDI is well 
equipped with an array of 
apparatuses to help its employees 
"get away from it all." There's the 
tennis court on the roof, the sand-
volleyball and basketball courts in 
the courtyard and the gym. And 
then there's Hirshberg himself. 

According to Hirshberg, thi s 
innovati ve thinking is done in a 

The president enjoys sharing the 
story of the time that 01 was 
pushing a deadline on the Altima, a 
recent creation of Nissan. The 
tension was thick and the ideas 
were stalled, 0 he announced 
"movie-time," and treated all the 
employees to "Silence of the 
Lambs."

The UCSD Guardian 

A writer from Autoweek, with 
whom Hirshberg had missed a 
meeting as a · result of the 
excursion, called the next day and 
asked Hirshberg what the 
connection between serial murder 
and car design was. Hirshberg 
responded with a smile, "We and 
Hannibal Lecter are both in the 
business of realizing fanta ies, and 
ours are hopefully somewhat less 
destructi ve." 

In addition to the fun factor, 
whieh Hirshberg call " tepping 
back from the canvas," the facilities 
in which NDI's employees work are 
a bright a a summer day. The 
studios are large and spacious with 
high ceilings and walls made of 
glass, through which the sun pour 
to assist with the work. Small 
gardens are scattered out ide the 
building, and water Oows through 
fountains and mini aqueducts , 
funher enhancing the employees' 
view. 

Ironically, the serenity of the 
seene disguises the seriousness of it 
all. NDI is locked up tighter than 
Fort Knox - but make no mistake 
- nothing as boxy as gold bullion 
has ever escaped its corridors. NDI 
is equipped with the finest in laser-
detection and video-surveillance 
equipment to ensure the secrecy of 
its designs. 

"We don 't advertise this place 
because what we do is very 
clandestine," Hirshberg admits. 
But he goes on to acknowledge in 
this the irony that, "designer are 
by nature sharers who like to 
express." 

Some of that expressi veness is 
released right here at UCSO where 
NOI employees often lecture. NDI 
also offers tours to groups from 
UC 0, and Hirshberg himself sits 
on the Board of the International 
Relat ions/Paci fic Studie s 
Depanment. 

What Hirshberg preaches is the 

FEATURES 17 

importance of ideas to business and 
the importance of creativity 10 
ideas. He firmly believes that new 
ideas are the key 10 the succe s of 
any business, and NDI is 
undeniable proof of the 
productivity of this philosophy. 

"I pent 15 years [at GM] 
fighting the system to introduce 
[ideasJ. And yet business needs 
ideas, so it' really a peculiar 
si tuation where bureaucracy and 
creativity are a joke together," 
Hirshberg explained. 

Fortunately for Hi rshberg, he 
got the chance to make a perfect 
world for him elf one snowy 
Oetroit day in 1979, and now the 
world can sec t he products of 
NDl's creativity. 

"My belief is that the priOl:iples 
that we've conceived here have 
appli cations way beyond ju t 
creative cO~lpanies," he said, "and 
all businesses thrive on having 
ideas when they need them."

Fullerton and Cal Tech Get Tagged by Tritons 
UNDEFEATED: Coming off a great 1995 season in which the UCSD women claimed first place' in the Southern California 
Interco11egiate Fencing Federation, the Tritons have started the 1996-1997 campaign with fi ve straight victories 
By Sean Rahlml 
Sports Editor 

If you asked the average student 
on campus which UCSD athletic 
quad is on t he hottest streak, not 

many people would respond 
with the Fencing team. But 
fact is that the men and 
women of the Triton fencing 
team are undefea ted and 
crushing their opponents. 

The women are coming 
off a dominating 1995 sea-
son in which they garnered 
the overall championship of the 
Southern California Intercollegiate 
FencingConference. And they don ' t 
seem to ha ve lost a step, conqueri ng 
their foes in the epee and foil events 
so far thi s year. This past weekend, 
lJCSD played a rude host to Cal 
Tech and Cal State Fullenon, trounc-
ing both schools to cnd the first hal f 
of the season and improve to 5-0 on 
the year. 

Juniorepee spcciali stJanet Wertz 

and Suzanne Walters have compiled 
identical 20-0 records through the 
first half of the season, while Jeanie 
Rockway follow closely behind 
with a stellar 18-2 individual record. 

In the foi I team scori ng, Ca-
pri ce Roberts ( 17-3) and 
Hannah Griffith (16-4) have 
performed well all season. and 
did so again agai nst Fullerton 
and Cal Tech thi past week-
end. 

"The women's epee is re-
ally doing well and the foi l 

team ha been a nice surprise for 
us," Coach Mike Aiau said. "Thank ' 
to the strength of our women's team 
we arc till undefeated." 

The men have been led in eachof 
the three events - epee, foil and 
sabre - by a dIfferent Triton , In the 
epee, Ti m Marsh leads the pack with 
a 10-5 individual record as the team 
has started with a 3-2 overall record. 

Mall Soskins leads the sabre 
squad with an individual record of 

Zaki Rubenstein/Guardian 
Zono: The UCSD fencers dominated Cal Tech in epee and foil.

all record, while the foil squad has 
started off slowly, recording a 2-3 

overall team record. Adam Kisor 
leads the foil group with a 9-6 indi-
vidual mark,

UCSD handled the toughest com-
petition of the season - Cal Sate

mains. Next February, the Tritons 
will travel to Stanford to take on the 
powerhouse Cardinal. 

"[The time off] gives us a chance 
to kind of catch our brcath," Aiau 
said, "Everyone has been working 
really hard, especially the women 's 
foil and epee. They have put in a lot 
of effort and it has obviously paid 
of[" 

UCSD hopes to ulilize a young 
crop of fencers likeJustin Fitzgerald, 
who picked up a foil two months 
ago yet has garnered a 3- 1 mark on 
the season, Over the break, the Tri -
tons will be able to compete and 
challenge each other in order to get 
ready for February, 

"Stanford wi II be our strength-
of-schedule match," Aiau added, 
"We need to beat Stanford to get

HEARTBREAK: UC Davis bounced UCSD in the WWPA Semifinals, 
ruining the Tritons' hopes of playing at home in the Final Four on Dec. 6 
By Sean Rahlml 
Sport9 Editor 

Pride, According to Random 
House it is the quality or digni -
fied self respect. And in the case 
of the UCSD men 's water 
polo team, it is something 
that they have in spades. 

A fter defeating Occiden-
tal by a comfonable 19-7 
margin, the UCSD men's 
water polo team saw its hopes 
of defending the Western 
Water Polo Assoc iation 
Championships sink in the water. 
UCSD dropped a crushing 9-B de-
cision to UC Davis in the semifi-
nals held in Colorado Springs last 
Saturday , But the Tritons did not 
let up after the heartbreaking loss, 
taking l:are of business on Sunday 
in the third place game by defeat-
ing Sanla Clara 13-7, 

Knowing the tough loss to the 
Aggies prevented the squad from 
playing in the Final Four at 
Canyonview pool in La Jolla did 
not deter the men from defeating 
the Broncos in the consolation 
game. 

"This is a rea l rough loss," 
Romas Kudirka said. " It was a 
chance for us to upset some of the 
top schools at home, where we 
play well and it s great anytime 
you haveachance to have NCAAs 
at home," 

The Triton (IB-IO) will mi s

onship game for only the second

Coach Denny Harper' s squads 

have won the title nine 
t ilne ' and became the fi rst 
Divi sion III sehooilo par-
ticipate in a Division I Fi -

The young UCSD team 
squared off against the 
Aggies for the fourth time 
thi s season on Saturday, 

having won IWO of the three pre-
vious meetings, However, the 
Tritons could nol grab a third 
win on this day , 

UCSD grabbed an ea rl y 3-1 
lead in the first period and sti II 
Icd 4-3 at the halfway mark , but 
the Aggics jumped ahead with 
rour goals in the third quarter and

Harper said. " But we made a

couple of big mistakes in this 
game, and anytime you lose a 
one-point game, you can turn to a 
ton of [plays which could have 
changed the outcome]," 

Junior two-meter man Kudirka 
- I SHeam tournament se lection 
- led the UCSD offense with three 
goals. Also pUlling in a strong per-
formance was freshman Ross 
mecham who was the second-lead-
ing scorer for UCSD in the tourna-
ment and made the 2nd-team selec-
tion along with junior co-captai n 
Adam Bollenbach, 

The Tritons held the Aggics to 
on ly nine points but the inconsis-
tent play of the young squad finally 
caught up with them, 

"We had a lot of turnovers." 
Roma Kudirka admitted, " I think 
it has a lot to do with us bei ng so 
young. We have two freshman in 
the starting line-up, 0 everybody 
is pretty inexperienced. But we 
plan to ki ck some bUll ncxt year. " 

The young Tritons do not lose 
anyone to graduation. and look to 
use the experi ence they have 
ga ined thi s yea r for thei r champi -
onship run nex t yea r, 

" We tried put [ aturdayJ be-
hind us," Bollenbach sa id, "We 
want to set some goa ls for our· 
selves, and today we came to-
gether as a team and we're start-
ing next yea r off on a good note."

Tritons Trounce Trinity 
LONE STARS: Texas provides tl:te perfect setting for the 
Tritons, who remained undefeateQ in winning the Trinity Invite 
By TraYl. HIli 
Staff Writer 

In the wide and sometimes strange world 
of sports, it is not uncommon Lo hear athletes 
make outrageous predictions. Consideri ngJoe 
Namalh's famous guarantee of victory 
in Super Bowl III. Pat Riley's promise 
of a repeat championship fo r his Los 
Angele Lakers and E va nder 
Holyficld 's so lemn vow that he would 
defeat Mike Tyson, Tri ton Head Coach 
Judy Malone's talk of a tirst Final Four 
appearance for her women'~ basket hall 
team IS not qu ite eart hshaking. Alter 
all. UCSD I, ~upposed to be one of the top 
tclllm In thc We. t this sea on. 

Last weekend, the Triton~ proved that 
Malone'~ talk wa~n't JUM a hoop dream by 
,l3rt1ng their 'cason oft Wit h two important 
WinS and a champIOnship. 

UCSD traveled to San An tonio. Texas la~t 
weekend to partll:ipate In a tough carly sea~un 
tournament. the Trinity Universtly In vita-
1I0nai. The team 's first-round opponent j ust 
happened to be the hosting Tigers. The Tri -
tons knew thi s would be a tough game agai nst 
a Trinity squad that made the pl ayoff~ last 
season. 

Despi te the fact that this wa the first 
regular-season game for both squads, there 
was a playoff atmosphere on the court. Be-
cause the other two teams at the tournament, 
Concordia College and Roanoke College, are 
also perennial playoff contenders, both UCS D 
and Trinity wanted make a statement. 

The game lived up to its billing, as it was 
tight throughout. The Tritons led at halftime, 
hUl only by a slim three·point margin, 36-33. 
The second half saw more of the same even 

play. While UCSDcouldn't break away, they 
slowly but surely increased their lead. The 
Tritons had just a lillie too much momentum 
for the Tigers, winning 73·67. 

The key player for the Tritons came off the 
bench. Janessa Bayda, in her trium· 
phant return to the team after a knee 
injury kept her sidelined all last year, 
cored 15 points and was 3 for 3 from 

beyond the three-poi nt line. Herclutch 
performance was a huge factor in the 
victory, which sent the Tritons to the 
fina l against the feared Conwrd ia 
Eng les, one of the top DI vIsion III 

team in the country. 
After dispatching Tnnlty, the Tnton ' caml: 

into the tinal as the favorite. Once again. UCSD 
was nO[ to hedeOlcd. The Triton. played mastcr-
fu lIy, pccially at the defensi ve end of the flo()r. 
They to()~ a 12,p0lnt lead by halltlmc. holding 
Concordi" to a paltry 24 firM· hall POliltS. The 
lead proved to he too steep for Concordia 10 
overcome. as the Tri tons cruised to a 66-56 
championship wi n. 

Ci ndy Yamasaki continued a trend she 
staned last year: playing big for big games. 
Yamaski scored 15 points and di shed out 
eight assists. Also, Anne Westmoreland con· 
trihuted 12 points of her own. Karli Jungwirth 
pulled down I I boards, while scoring eight 
points. Bayda stayed perfect from downtown. 
hilling two of two three-pointers . 

These are games that can define a season. 
While it is still extremely early, as the Tritons 
log victories against potential playoff com· 
petitors, they will have that much more of an 
advantage in a post·season run. Bringing this 
championship home will also give the Tritons 
momentum for their upcoming homestand.

Tritons Open With a 
· Double Whammy 

.-

QUICK START: With wins in the first two games, including the home opener, 
UCSD is off to its best start in three years under Head Coach Greg Lanthier 
By Kevin McLa ..... lln 
Staff Writer 

Another wild sea on in the West is 
upon us. and the Tritons have come 
out with six shooters ablazin '. Begin-
ning Friday night again t a Claremont 
C911ege team that was 19-81ast 
season, the men 's basketball 
team gunned its way to an ea y, 
103-90 victory . 

The offense was clicking all 
night long in the season opener, 
as the Tritons jumped out to an 
early leaJ . Pre-season Ail-Con-
ference cente r Mall Aun e 
scored early and often agai nst an over-
matched Stags interior defense. tall y-
ing a career-high 38 poi nts. Mike 
Thimgan and Adam Libby kept the 3· 
point hots coming. fini~hing with 15 
and in points respectively. Libby 
added eight assists with only two turn-
overs, and played an ironman 390140 

minute~ against the tags. 

Perfect Start ... 
Tritons 56 47 

It appeared Claremont might make 
things interesting, as the 20-pointlead 
the Tritons had bui It up in the first half 
dwindled to near ten, but it never 
dropped below double digits. Although 
the outcome was never in serious jeop-

ardy, the men remain wary of 
such letdowns. 

"We may have been men-
tally fatigued , content to be up 
by 20," Triton Head Coach 
Greg Lanthier said. "We want 
to avoid those ups and downs." 

The team avoided los ing to 
a qu ick, sc rappy bunch at 

Whittier Co llege on Saturday night. 
Aune again led the charge with 23 
poin ts and 13 rebounds, backed by 
Thimgan' s 21 . ixth man ick 
Marou tsos ~cored 15 points off the 
bench, including four three-pOinter. 
- all in the first hair. 

"He (Maroutso~) really kept us

Battling a warm-
ing defense, the Tri -
tons were forced into 
18 turno ver\ and shot 

defen e shut Whittier down to only 31 
second-half points en route to a 85-74 
victory . At 2-0. UCSO now boasts the 
best start ever under Lanthier. 

"We' re trying to key [our play] 
around our defense - we [already] 
ha ve the offensi ve threats," said Aune. 
"We know we can score 80-90 points 
a game." 

As expected, four of the starter 
have been eeing extended duty as the 
onl y sea. oned veterans on the team. 
Versatile forward Mike Wall has also 
been logging major minute, and de-
spite trugg ling with hi s shot, he has 
been helping the team in other ways.

It is said that all good things must come 
to an end . For the 0 women ' , vol ley-
hall team, the end came Satu rday at the 
hands of I. Olaf ollege in the 
NCAA Quarterfinals. 

Atthe end of a season in which 
the team logged more frequent 
flyer mi les than a trave ling sales-
man, the Triton hit the road to 
face a SI. Olaf team that they had 
previously beaten on an early sea-
on trip to Minnesota. Early in 

the first meeting, UCSO took control of the 
match and did not allow its hosts to regain 
any momentum. At that time, SI. Olaf 
(ranked higher than UCSO) was undefeated. 
Going into the quarterfinal match-up, the 
team had dropped only two other matches.

fire ," Triton Head oach Duncan McFarland 
sa id , "It seemed to be their night and we just 
couldn ' t do much about il." 

Riding the momentum of the Western 
Regional victory aga in t arch-riva l Califor-

nia Lutheran, UCSO headed into 
a hostile gy m to face a team that 
was pl ay ing its be t vo lleyball of 
the year. 

With the character of a strong 
road team, the Tritons took some 
of the enthusiasm out of the home 
crowd by fighting through a fren-
zied first game. From the first 

serve, the two teams sided out back and 
forth , with each squad clawing' for points. 
In a barn burner, UCSO pulled out the fir t 
game, 15-12. 

"The first game was a great victory," 
McFarland said, "but we needed that sec-
ond game to stay on top." 

=lilll:1 

ner the teams ~witc hed sides, the Tri-
tons found that the momentum from the 
first game was now In SI. Olaf's courl. The 
crowd, which had been quieted by the loss 
of the fi rst game, came to life. With a re-
newed energy, the Oles stormed out of the 
gate beh ind the play of junior midd le 
blockerTrac i Rasmussen. Rassmus en, one 
of two non-senior starters, took control of 
play at the net, racking up three solo blocks 
and a sisting on four others. 

Meanwhile, the Tritons found them elves 
struggling to generate a consistent offen-
sive threal, and were forced to scrap for 
every sideout. The Tritons managed to keep 
the game close with the strong play of their 
enior trio of Madelyn Ripken, Mieke 

Biesheuvel and Chri line Chi . The otes' 
squad proved to be too much, however, 
taking the second game, 15- 11.
