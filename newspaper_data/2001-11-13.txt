High,tech 
camera

Internet users 
could see into 
residence halls 
By GEOFF DIETRICH 
Associate News Editor 

An innovative camera that 
broadcast high-quality images of a 
UCSD construction site over the 
Internet has been taken offline 
amid concerns that it could allow 
users to peer into the windows of 
campus apartments. 

Anyone wi th In ternet access 
could go to a page within the 
J acobs School of Engineering's 
Web site and control the camera 
using buttons on the page. The 
camera was intended to promote 
the construction of the new 
Cali fornia Institute for 
Telecommunications and 
Information Technology building 
- also known as Cal-(I1)2 -
located east of the current main 
cngineering building. 

The camera was quickly taken 
offline last week after members of 
Warren administration notified the 
camera's owners of its unforeseen 
capabilities. 

"When we realized there were 
privacy concerns, we took the cam-
era offline," said Greg Hidley, 
director of engineering computing 
at the Jacobs School and head of

UCSD honors u.s. 
vets in ceremony 
Veterans Association dedicates 
event to U.S. terror victims 
By JEFFREY WHm 
News Editor 

The Veterans Association at 
UCSD honored U .S. veterans 
Friday with a ceremony that 
included a Medal of Honor recip-
ient, the highest ranking female in 
the U.S. Marine Corps, and a for-
mer 'staff director for Gov. Gray 
Davis. 

This year's Second Annual 
Recognition Ceremony was dedi -
cated to the victims of the Sept. 
II terrorist attacks and to the ser-
vicemen and women who were 
called to active duty in response 
to the attacks. 

Chancellor Robert C. Dynes 
issued a notice Nov. 8 to all 
UCSD staff and students encour-
aging supervisors to allow 
employees time off so they could 
attend the event as long as it 
would not interfere with the func-
tion of the university. 

The association presented 
Vince Hall, former staff director 
for the governor, with its 
Appreciation Award for Hall's 
work on making Veterans Dayan 
officially recognized holiday at 
the University of C~~fornia. 

Unti l January 2000, the 
University of California did not 
recognize the state holiday 
because the UC Board of 
Regents is viewed by the state as 
a separate entity, and therefore is 

not subject to laws govern ing 
sta te agencie . 

Introduci ng H all, Veterans 
Association Chair Nick Aguilar 
sa id Hall was instrumental in 
forming the initiative from the 
governor's offi ce urging the 
regents to observe the holiday. 

Hall said he was grateful for 
the award and for the sacrifices 
that the more than 25 mi ll ion liv-
ing U.S. veterans have made in 
the line of duty. 

"As long as there is evil in this 
world coupled with violence, 
there must be people who are 
willing to stand up with equal 
determination, armed with the 
principles of truth, freedom, jus-
tice and democracy," Hall said. 
"That is the challenge we face in 
Mghanistan today, and the chal-
lenge that generations of 
Americans have faced since the 
birth of our country." 

Col. Angela Salinas, who is the 
highest- ranking woman in the 
U .S. Marine Corps, attended the 
cvent and addressed the audience, 
much of which was comprised of 
U.S. veterans. 

The highly decorated Salinas, 
commanding officer of the largest 
marine recruitment district in the 
United States, talked about the 
importance of setting aside a day 
to contemplate the risks U .S. vet-

Catching prayer Campus sees spike in car vandalism 
UCSD police, parking services step up patrols in response

A rash of car vandalism has hit 
UCSD parking lots in recent weeks, 
according to UCSD Police 
Department data. 

In 2000, 52 cars were reported 
stolen from campus. Though 2001 
data indicates a dramatic decrease so 
far - 24 cars were reported stolen as of 
the first week in November - a dra-
matic spike in car vandalism has cam-
pus police increasing patrols of lots. 

This year, 85 vehicles have been 
vandalized at UCSD, as compared to 
56 for all of 2000. Over 10 percent of

the car vandalisl1ls occurred last week. 
UCSD police offi cer Alan Jenkins 

said the criminal activity seems to 
focus on the School of Medicine -
lots P601, P604 and P60B - though 
other patterns are difficult to find . 

Jenkins said no particular vehicles 
have been targeted and nothing Ollt 
of the ordinary has been taken. 

"Usually a window is smashed or a 
door punched to gain entry," Jenkins 
sa id. "It's usually stereo equipment 
that's taken." 

In response to the crimes, extra 
patrols by officers and Transportation 
and Parking Services employees have 
been added.

It is estimated that 3 1,000 cars 
pass through UCSD's parking lots 
on a dail y basis. Despite measures 
taken by the police and TPS to dis -
courage burglars from breaking into 
cars at UCSD, Jenkins said that 
those who park their cars at UCSD 
can take measures of their own to 
prevent t hei r cars from being bur-
glarized. 

Jenkins suggested that people u e 
security devices in their cars and that 
they report any suspicious activity in 
campus parking lots. 

"The best way is to use the call 
boxes placed in the parking lots or ca ll 
534-HELP," Jenkins said.

technology infrastructure for Cal-
(IT)2. 

The Warren college administration 
asked the ca:nera operators to adjust 
the "Iewing capabilities of the camcra 
to protcCt students ' privacy. 

Ilidlcy said the camera had to be 
taken completely offline because an 
adjustment "does not seem to bc an 
option." 

"IThe I,Veb sitel was not completed 
but unfortunatcly its avai lability 
reachcd the public before we could 
take other measures to protect access 
and provide additional controls to 
limit its use on the building site," 
I lidley said. . 

Some residents of Earl Warren 
College whose apartments are located 
Within the camera's range are con-
cerned that the camera may allow oth-
ers to invade their privacy via the 
Internet. 

"I believe that the camera is an 
invasion into an area where most peo-
ple expect to have privacy," said Jesse 
Coward, chair of the Warren College 
Council. 

Jason Boyer, a \,varren sophomore, 
also lives in an apartment ,vithin view-
i ng range of the camera. 

"I don't really take offensc to this 
bccause I doubt someone set up the 
camera to look specifically into the 
apa rtmcnts," Boyer sa id. "I guess you 
could say it was a case of good inten-
tions." 

The future of the camera is unclear 
due to thc concern for residents' priva-
cy. 

Some Warren students expressed 
mixed feelings regarding the camera 
and its innovative interactive technol-
ogy and ability to broadcast live 
images of their apartments over the 
World Wide Web. 

"I think the camera itself is really 
cool ," Wood said. "But I don't dlink 
this is the right place to do it - where 
people live." 

I,<\farren sophomore Eric Leebo's 
apartment could be seen on the Web. 
Although he said it was an intnlsion 
into his privacy, he said he liked the 
camera . 

"It 's interesting; you can look at it 
and control it but I don't think the 
purpose should be so pcople can go 
around and look at everything," he 
said. 

Hidley said the purpose of the 
expcrimental camera and Web site 
was to demonstrate how existing 
technologies could be used in inter-
esting ways. 

Some Warren residents, including 
Leebo and Boyer, said they would 
like to see a similar camera modified 
so that it could not zoom in on stu-
dents' apartments or to see one 
placed in a more public space, such as 
on top of the Price Center or Geisel 
Library. 

Hidley said that is not in the plans 
because residences could still be seen 
from those sites and that modifying 
the camera's range is not currently an 
option.

UCSA supports 'comprehensive review' 
The UC Student Association backed the 

Academic Senate's proposed overhaul of admissions 
standards used by the University of Califomia. The 
proposal is to be voted on by the UC Board of 
Regents on Wednesday. 

Under the so-called "comprehensive review" 
process proposed by the UC Academic Senate, the 
University of California would no longer require that 
its campuses admit 50 to 75 percent of their incom-
ing classes on the basis of academic criteria alone. 
Such criteria include GPA, standardized test scores, 
advanced placement credit and outstanding work in 
a particular subject. 

Instead, all admissions would be based on UC 
eligibility - which would rr:main unchanged - and 
other factors such as special talents, hfe experi-
ences, and achievements made in light of special 
circumstances such as a disability or low family 
income. Location of applicants' secondary school 
and place of residence could also be taken into 
account. 

The UCSA stated that it supports the proposal 
because it feels that the current admissions policy 
denies access to students who would be successful 
in the UC system, and who would contribute to their 
classmates' education. 

UCSD student receives $250 
award for poster 

Serena Moseman, 'a UCSD ecology, behavior and 
evolution sciences major, was one of eight under-
graduates to receive an award for research posters 
presented at the 2001 Society for Advancement of 
Chicanos and Native Americans in Science National 
Conference in Phoenix. 

Moseman's poster, titled "Infaunal Density, 
Composition, and Diversity in a One-Vear-Old 
Spartina Foliosa Marsh in Tijuana Estuary, Califomia: 
centered on work done in ecology and environmen-
tal sciences under her faculty mentor Lisa Levin of 
the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. 

Moseman was one of three UCSD Academic 
Enrichment Program students presenting scientific 
posters at the conference. The meeting drew 2,000 
participants nationwide and included more than 160 
poster presentations. Winning students each 
received a $250 cash prize. 

Through AEP, UCSD undergraduates can partici-
pate in a wide range of research-oriented academic 

. programs intended to expose students early to 
research and encourage them to pursue doctoral or 
other advanced degrees after graduation. 

Attendance at the conference for UCSD students 
was supported by the California Alliance for Minority 
Participation. Students developed their posters while 
working with mentors this year during the AEP 
Summer Research Program. 

New drugs found to decrease 
symptoms of Alzheimer's 

Researchers at the UCSD School of Medicine and 
the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Fla., have shown in 
cell cultures and mice that certain nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs also known as NSAIDs, decrease 
the harmful amyloid-beta 42 protein that forms brain 
plaques in victims of Alzheimer's disease. 

The new findings, published in the Nov. 8, 2001 
issue of the joumal Nature, suggest that NSAID ther-
apy has a direct impact on the cause of the disease, 
which is believed to be the abnormal deposition of 
the AB42 proteins in the brain. 

The best-known example of an NSAID is ibupro-
fen. 

The new study is the first to demonstrate a spe-
cific pharmacological inhibition of AB42 production. 
Specifically, the NSAlDs ibuprofen, indomethacin and 
sulindac sulphide decreased AB42 by as much as 80 
percent. Other NSAlDs, induding aspirin, Naproxen 
and celecoxib, had no effect on AB42. 

The research was led by Sascha ~ of the 
UCSD neurosciences department, and senior authors 
were Edward Koo, also of the UCSD neurosciences 
department and Todd E. Golde of the Mayo dinic 

MMW students honored at 
10th annual writing showcase 

Eleanor Roosevelt College students Ben Gibbs, 
Sara Goetz, Madeline Miller, Vat-Suen Poon and Lucy

Goetz, Poon and Saltmarsh spoke at the event, 
describing the process by which they selected their 
topics, and each also gave a brief overview of the 
subjects covered in their papers. 

Gibbs' and Miller's papers were presented by 
MM~ professors becaus~ the students are cUfrently

Legislation to shelter students from credit card advertising is unnecessarily protective ' 

By EMILY VlllO 
Contributing Writer 

It's kind of cute to restrict stu-
dent exposure to credit cards for 
fear we'll drown in debt. 

Gov. Gray Davis signed a bill 
Sept. 12 that affects the California 
State University system and com-
munity coll eges, and may be 
adopted by the University of 
California as well. 

Regulating the tactics credit 
card companies use to recruit new 
student customers on campus will 
help curb student debt, proponents 
of the bill argue. 

But if the government is wor-
ried about my Visa bill, I hesitate 
to think how it might react to the 
$ 15,000 in student loans my par-
ents and I took out this year. Now 
that's student debt. 

The bill is not the most excit-
ing thing in the world. Its impact 
will likely be minimal - it is no 
big deal if credit card companies 
are forbidden to give us lollipops 
and highlighters for applying for 
their card . 

The interesti ng thing about this 
bill is the rationale behind it : 
Legislators and university adminis-
trators must intervene on behalf of 
students who are unable to take 
responsibility for their own 
fina nces. 

I t appears that we are innocents 
who need protection from wily 

credit card companies. 
..... This assumption is dangerous 

because it creates a relationship of 
dependence between the student 
and the university. When we are 
protected from marketing, we fail 
to develop money management 
skills that will be necessary in the 
working world - skills, in fact, 
that are necessary now. But we are 
not asked to become: more eco-
nomic in our spending, nor are we 
asked to be more moderate in our 
consumption. 

For the sake of argument, stu-
dents accept the premise that stu-
dent debt is a problem. In fact, 
this premise is widely accepted 
and easily proved . 

Citibank studies during 1999 
showed that about 65 percent of 
students have a personal credit 
card. National studies for the same 
year showed that undergraduate 
students, ages 18 to 24, had an 
average credit card debt of $1,843 . 

A news article in Tbt Daily 
Ttxa", a student newspaper at the 
University of Texas, reported that 
78 percent of undergraduate stu-
dents have at least one credit card, 
and 95 percent of graduate stu-
dents-have a credit card. 

An article from USA W,tknul 
reported that average student 
credit card debt has risen this year 
to about 52,220 for undergraduate 
studen ts and 55,800 for graduate 
students. 

Maybe we need help, but the 
paternalistic nature of the bill irks 
me. It reminds me of SB 19, a bill 
that seeks to limit junk food in 
California elementary schools. 

It seems that children were 
plunking quarters into too many 
vending machines on campus, 
buyinf too much pizza from their 
schoo cafeterias, and generally 
getting fat enough to worry the 
grown-ups. So legislators wrote a 
bill, which may go into effect 
January 2002, proposing new 
health standards for food dished 
up in elementary schools. 

I wonder if the legislators, in 
the spirit of nutrition, cleaned out 
their own vending machines or 
forbade junk food in their own 
lunchrooms. This reminds me of a 
joke I heard in Spain: You can eas-
ily discern an American in a crowd 
- look for the fat one, and you 
have your man. 

I have the feeling that students 
are the new fat children of the 
State Senate. We cannot keep 
away from the sweets, so they are 
going to take them away from us. 

In explaining the new rule that 
credit card companies cannot offer 
students gifts if they apply for a 
card, an official was quoted in the 
GUllrdill1l as saying, "Many college 
students got credit cards just 
beca use they wan ted free gi fts. " 

That's just silly. We are not 
that dumb. I do not believe that 

there are students who are duped 
into signing up for a Discover 
card for a free gift. 

For one thing, even if you do 
sign up for a card, you can choose 
not to activate it. If you activate it, 
you can choose not to use it. And 
if you use it, you can choose to pay 
it off on time to avoid that 17.99 
percent annual rate. 

You and I know that. The advo-
cates of that bill should know that, 
too, and they should remember 
that there are plenty of nonstudents 
who are not much better than we 
are at wise spending - how much 
is that national debt again? 

According to the 200 I 
Consumer Federation of America 
report, aggregate credit card debt 
doubled between 1990 and 1996, 
with an average household credit 
card debt of 57,000. 

On its Web site, NEWAY, a 
nonprofit orpniution that works 
to reduce debt, reports that the 
average household has 10 credit 
cards. Students are not the only 
ones who need help. 

We should hope that the main 
effect of the bill will be better 
debt education, which is meant to 
be pan of the bill. I am skeptical 
of the claim that students lwho are 
"inexperienced" with /oIsing a 
credit card get themselves into 
financial trouble. More 1i~ly, 
impulsive shoppers and students 
with expensive taste get them-

selves into debt, no matter how 
"experienced" they are at using a 
credit card. 

But if those in the know think 
that debt education is a good idea, 
let's give it a try and see what hap-
pens. 

Certainly our student govern-
ment seems to be for it. The A.S. 
Council plans to request that 
Chancellor Robert C. Dynes 
impose regulatory policies on 
credit card companies. 

At any rate, it seems a harm-
less, if not inetfectual little bill. 
Because it means that we may 
have one less vendor to dodge as 
we make our way down Library 
Walk, I applaud it. 

If they want to eliminate com-
mercials in the name of our inno-
cence, OK. 

And hey, perhaps things are 
not as grim as they seem. A study 
posted on a Web site - partially 
sponsored by none other than 
Visa - shows that 53 percent of 
students with credit cards pay 
their bills, in full and on time, 
every month. Less than 50 percent 
of adults can make that same 
claim. 

Because the study says that 
only I J percent of college stu-
dents who hold credit cards 
applied for them on a university 
campus, the bill, if incorporated at 
UCSD, may not be necessary any-
way.

Movies further harmful stereotypes 
Comedies portray African-Americans inaccurately 
By KECIA R. FELTON 
Staff Writer 

V\'hose image pops into your 
mind when you envision shiny gold 
front teeth, baggy clothes and mar-
ijuana? Who else - the typical 
black man. 

ot only does this black man 
sport the atti re that fits the descrip-
tion of nil other black men in thi 
country, but hc also speaks the 
"black" dia lect - slang-peppered 
Ebonics. 

I Ie holds the typical black occu-
pation, or rather lack thereof, and 
he has an acrimonious attitude, 

hell ~bent on putting "Whitey" in 
his place. 

1b accompany his other attrib-
utes deemed necessary to legitimize 
his tatus as mlly black, this figure 
is lumped into the same category as 
all the other prison-bound, shift-
less, misogynistic black men just 
like him. 

Are .you offended yet? Good, 
because so am I. 

Last Tuesday night, I reluctant-
ly attended the free screening of 
Universal Studios' soon-to-be-
released 'motion picture " How 
High ." 

T he film turned my stOmach as 
I sa t squirming in my seat. Even 
more disturbing to me than the 
stereotypical depiction of my fellow 
African-Americans on the screen 
was the amount o f laughter bub-
bli ng up from some 500 students in 
Ma ndevi lle Auditorium . They 
laughed through the scenes featur - ' 
ing African-Americans evading 
employment or having no ambi-
tion. They laughed through the 
scenes featuring African-American 
men slapping two unsuspecting 
women. Even when blacks were 
shown as the thieves that they are 
expected to be by society, the audi -
ence laughed. 

Something is wrong with this 
picture. I am disgusted with the 
generali7.ed Hollywood portrayal 
of black culture, and I am even 
more upset by. the level of accep-

basically 

A s a college stu-dent, federal law 
requires that I spent at 
least 40 hours every 
week procrastinating, 
wasting time and just 
generally fucking 
around. 

Overacrue'!!:r that I am, i have 
discovered the perfect way to accom-
plish this: online personality tests. 

Clearly, these quizzes are an 
unparalleled waste of time, and that 
is a good thing. Bu! there still 
remains one almost imperceptible 
problem: They are total crap. 

Of course, I base this conclusion 
on the fact that according to one 
such personality test, I am 53 per-
cent bitch. This is just plain offen-
sive, and anyone who knows me 
will immediately reali ze why: I am 
dearly 100 petcent, grade-A, top-
choice bitch. 

Obviously there are inaccuracies 
in these quizzes that must be recti-
fi ed . But until they are, I have altru-
istically taken it upon myself to 
compile a list of only five questions 
that will undoubtedly reveal your 
true personality. (perhaps it's nice 
shit like this that makes me only 53 
percent bitch.) 

At this point, I would like to 
insert a disclaimer before you take 
my better-than-any-other-test-of-
its-kind personality quiz. 

tance this denigrating representa-
tion meets amongst the public. I 
attended the free screening not for 
recreation, but sp,-,cifica lly to 
address this is~ue of immeasu rab le 
importance. 

Tinseltown would have all 
Americans believe that African-
Americans are entertaining by 
nature, and that black and drugs, 
black and sex, or black and igno-
rance are alwa ys mutually incl usivc. 
"How High" was a production that 
trumpeted these themes consistent-
ly, so for those people who attend-
ed and had a good chuckle, and for 
those moviegoers who plan on 
she ll ing out $8 when it is released 
in December, let me illustrate how 
low the movie really is. 

Every time I see the ubiquitous 
marijuana leaf adorning a T-shirt 
or baseball cap, I wince. I am 
painfully aware that the marketers 
of those items are specifically 
addressing youth, hip-hop culture 
and blacks. Countless numbers of 
black entertainers don the emblem 
as though it were the insignia of the 
African-American lifestyle. Weed 
was not a staple in my household 
when I was a young child, nor was 
drug usage a taci tly understood 
practice. 

Where are the images of 
African-Americans who do not use 
marijuana on a regular basis? "The 
Cosby Show?" Maybe "The Fresh 
Prince of Bel Air?" Keep going -
or can you? 

Every black artist's video on 
MlV's "Total Request Live" pro-
motes the stereotype that black 
men have no greater ambition than 
to blaze up each and every day of 
the year. While these people cer-
tainly exist, they are in no way the 
majority, but with movies such as 
"How High," Americans are hard-
pressed to form alternate conclu-
sions. 

To the black man, women are 
sexual objects: pawns to be played 
like a game of chess. And of course, 
black women do not mind being 
objectified and mistreated by being 

Disclaimer: This quiz was man-
ufactured to reveal your inner char-
acter - I take no responsibility for 
the results. So if you turn out to be 
a total loser, a seria l killer or AI 
Gore, this is clearly your fault and 
not the tests. Also, if you have 
repeatedly been told that you have 
no personality, please refrain from 
even attempting to take this test 
and wasting everyone's time. 

OK, here it is. Circle the letter 
of the answer tha t you feel is the 
most accurate, and at the end, you 
will have my assessment of your 
personali ty. 
I . Are you male or female? 

(a) Female. 
(b) M~1c. 
(c) T he doctors haven't decided 
yet. 

2. Do you know your own name? 
(a) No. I call myself the Magical 
It. 
(b) Yes (duh). I've known it since 
I was 14 years old. 
(c) Yes. It's AI Gore. 

3. If you could be any kind of tree, 
what would you be? 

(a) A palm tree - it's a So-Cal 
thing. 
(b) A redwood - it's a Nor-Cal 
thing. 
(c) What do you mean, could be 
any kind of tree? 

4. You prefer social interaction: 
(a) In large, booze-friendly envi -
ronments that can easily be 
turned into orgies. 
(b) In intimate groups that can 
also be turned into orgies 
(though perhaps not as easily -
after al!, you like a challenge). 
(c) One-on-one with the voices 
in your head (no orgies, but at 
least you know the conversa-
tions will be interesting). 

5. To you, the most important part 

ca lled hoes and bitches as if they 
were not given any other name at 
birth . This is all true and qui te 
funny, right? 

If you are shaking your head in 
disagreement, then you must not 
have been in Mandeville 
Auditorium last Tuesday night, 
because . it seemed as if almost 
everyone in the audience ·thought 
these were extremely humorous 
assertions. 

However, I sat back with my jaw 
open at the film's message, which 
can be summated in one statement: 
All black men and women have an 
insatiable sexual appetite and they 
will go to any means, endure any 
treatment and surmount any obsta-
cle to get sex. Black women in 
clingy pants made of gold hrme 
strutted across the screen through-
out "How High," perpetuating 
every stereotype concerning the 
exotification of women of color 
that we have so passionately been 
trying to dispel. 

The main characters were black 
men who, despite their perpetually 
altered state, could single out a sexy 
woman from hundreds of yards 
away. Depicting black women as 
whores and black men as studs is an 
antiquated assumption that debases 
the loving and nunuring relation-
ships that the majority of black 
people engage in. 

We do not run panting like 
dogs in heat after members of the 
opposite sex, which movies such as 
"How To Be a Player" and "Booty 
Call" would have our society 
believe. "How High" is just anoth-
er movie that shines a negative 
light on black people who are 
struggling to erode damaging 
stereotypes. 

Another prevailing theme in 
"How High" is the disassociation of 
African-Americans from school. 
Education is not the enemy to 
black people - the poverty that 
hinders their performance in 
school is. The socially constructed 

See HOW HIGH, page 6 

of relationships is: 
(a) T he fact that you and your 
friends/lovers are all obsessed 
with "Star Trek." 
(b) You all have the same major, 
so you can share anecdotes about 
.me circuit that wouldn't die. 
(c) You all love orgies. 
OK, that was it. Still with me' 

Sti ll think these tests are a waste of 
time? Still think I am a cracked-out 
psychopath who has no life? Good! 
That means you did well! 

Now look at the letters you cir-
cled most often. Judging from the 
letter you picked most often - and 
that alone - I will now pigeon-
hole your personality into a catego-
ry that is piobdb!, bot.~ in:!!:c~rate 
and offensive. Fear not: This is the 
sign of a good test. 

If you picked Ns: You are an 
extroverted people-person who 
likes long walks on the beach and 
killing brain cells (preferably at the 
same time). This is based on noth-
ing more than the fact tha t this is a 
standard personality test determi-
nation that goes with the letter A. 

I f you picked B's: You are a sel f-
reliant introvert who has a good 
imagination and works best alone at 
a computer. Again, this is not based 
on facts, or even on the answers 
you picked, really. 

I f you picked C's: Like the last 
part of question No. 10 implies, you 
are an AI Gore clone who likes 
orgies just a little too much more 
than the average UCSD student. 
Scary to some, sexy to others. Either 
way, stay the hell away from me. 

So basically, I have proven that 
these tests are not only crap, but 
amazing wastes of time. Seriously, 
how much of your professor's lec-
ture were you able to ignore while 
doing this? You can thank me later.

Meet death sans fear 
Euphemisms propagate trepidity 
By ANNIE PAN 
Contributing Writer 

Death has always been and will 
always be with us: It is a funda-
mental part of human existence. 
Since the dawn of humankind, 
death has struck indiscriminately 
at rich and poor, famous and 
unknown, good and bad alike. It is 
perhaps this inevitable and unpre-
dictable nature that makes death 
so terrifying to many people, 
especially those who put a heavy 
weight on being in control of 
their own existence. 

But other SOCletles have 
learned to deal better with the 
reality of death than we seem to 
do. It is unlikely that any group 
has ever welcomed death's inva-
sion of life, but there are others 
who have effectively incorporated 
the expectation of death into their 
epistemology of life. 

In American society, the sub-
ject of death is avoided, ignored 
and denied . It is most likely 
because death reminds us of our 
human vulnerability in spite of all 
our technological superiority. 

Although it happens all the 
time, we pretend not to see it. 
When a person dies, he is whisked 
away in a blink; a magical vanish-
ing act does away with the evi-
dence before it can upset anyone. 

American adults routinely 
shelter children from death and 
dying because they believe that it 
is a way to protect their children 
from irreparable harm. By making 
death a taboo subject for children, 
we are denying the reality of its 
wstence. It is apparent that we 
are, in uuth, doing children a dis-
service by depriving them of the 
experience. We create fear that 
need not be there by separating 
the leaders of tomorrow from 
people who are dying or have 
died. 

When a person dies, we 
"assist" their loved oncs by doi ng 
things for them, by pretending to 
be cheerful, by putting make-up 
and materialisti c items on the 
dead so the individual looks "na t-
ural" and alive. Again, this so-
called assistance merely consists 
of acts of denial and apprehen-
sion, 

Even Ameri can hospi tals, a 
place where most deaths occur, 
consider death in some way one of 
their own unmentionables. In the 

How High: 
African-Americans por-
trayed as sex-obsessed 
ContInued from p.,e 5 
ncism that maintains sticky Aoors 
and g11SS ceilings is the enemy as 
weU. 

But young black people, when 

hospital, patients do not die -
they "expire." Patients do not die 
in the o peration room; rather, the 
patient is "lost on the table ." The 
hospital staff's inability to simpl y 
say the word "death" suggests a 
refusal to believe and acknowl-
edge its essence. 

W e abhor and reject the 
moment when we will face our 
death . Dea th is a casual maner 
when we read abou t it in a book 
or discuss it philosophically in the 
co ffeehouse. The problem of 
death, on the whole, does not 
strike us in the heart. 

Only when it is one's own 
imminent death, or that of a luved 
one, do people feel the desire for 
life. We make a frantic fight to 
hold onto life while slipping over 
the ed ge to dea th. This is rea I i tv 
in battle with the fairy tale mis'-
conception of an eternal life. The 
solid possibility of our own death 
is so unimaginable that , by 
instinct, we deny the fact . 

Instead of hiding death behind 
the sanitary walls of the hospital 
and the cosmctic disguise of the 
funeral home, we should recog-
nize and accept death. Only by 
acknowledging its existence can 
we progress as human beings. 

As strange as it may sound, one 
of the most proli fic formulas for 
growth is found through the expe-
riences of death . Individuals who 
have been lucky enough to share 
in the death of someone who 
understood its meaning eelll bet-
ter able to live ,md grow because 
of their experience. Those who 
have been wrapped up in the dis-
aster of death dUring wartime and 
who have faced it with dignity 
without allowing their feelin gs to 
become numbed and nonchalant 
have come out from their experi-
ences with growth and humanity 
greater than that accomplished 
through almost any other means. 

Even when we have come to 
accept death as a "itJI part of life. 
dying is difficult . Dying me,lIlS 
giving up life on Earth. 

But if we can adapt a different 
perspective on death, to reintro-
duce it into ou r lives so that is 
comes not a dreaded enemy but 
an expected friend, then we will 
be able to live our lives with sig-
nificance - with uue apprecia-
tion of our momentary existence, 
and of the ,estricri on on our _me 
in this world. 

We are all at fault every time we 
laugh at a joke made at the expense 
of cthn ility. The black actors and 
entertainers who denigrate [heir 
own race for capitalistic gains are 
accountable. Just because the)' are 
of the ethnicity they nega ' vely

Experts discuss bioterror threat 
UCSD hosts forum to combat fear with facts 
By SHARON LEE 
Contributing Writer 

In response to the anthrax infec-
tions tha t have been spread 
through U .S. mail in recent weeks, 
concerned citizens ga thered at the 
Copley International Conference 
Center at UCSDs Center for U.S.-
Mexican Snldies for a bioterrorism 
forum ov. 7. 

UCSD Healthcare and the 
Helen Edison Lecture Series spon-
sored the event to explain the phys-
ical and emotional i sues associated 
with bioterrorism. T he main focus 
of the meeting was educating and 
reassuring the public about 
anthrax. 

"We need to keep the panic 
down," said Supervisor Special 
Agent John Sylvester of the FBI 
counter terrorism squad. "An 
improperly handled threat is worse 
than the threat itself." 

"Bioterrorism: Responding to 
the Health Concerns o f Our 
Community" feanlred an array of 

..l!xpert speakers, including 
Sylvester, UCSD E mergency 
Medicine and Medical Director 
Jim Dunford, UCSD Emergency 
Medicine and Disaster 
Preparedne s officer Jake Jacoby, 
professor of psychiatry Saul Levine, 
and UCSD Director of 
Epidemiology and Infection 
Control Leland Rickman . 

Suzanne Rico, a reporter and 
anchor for BC, inuoduced the 
speakers and moderated questions;

veteran of the Vietnam War. 

Baca spoke about his experi-
enccs in Viemam and recounted 
the night he jumped on a grenade, 
saving his company from heavy 
casualties. He survived the blast 
because he threw his helmet over 
the grenade before jumping on top 
of it. It was for this selAess act that 
Baca was awarded the nation's top 
military decoration. 

Baca said his feelings about 
being a U.S. veteran are bitter-
sweet - that while he is proud to 
ha ve served his country in battle, 
he wishes that Americans would 
resolve themselves ' to avoid more 
connicts. 

Religion: 
Event packed Peterson 
Hall With large audience 
Continued from page 3 

The a udience ranged from stu-
dent members of the host organiza-
tions to smdents with no religious 
affiliation . 

"I just saw [an advertisement) 
on the board and I thought I'd 
check it out - I love all reli-
gions," said Marshall junior 
Courtney Pac he. 

According to the event's orga-
nizers, more religions were 
sought to provide even more 
information. 

"We included any religion we 
could get a hold of," said 
Stephanie Simmons, outreach 
coordinator for Campus Crusade 
for Christ. 

There was an open question-and-
answer session at the end of the five 
presentations. 

Rickman defined bioterrorism 
as " the intentionl l use of micro-
organisms or toxins to produce 
death or disease in humans, animals 
or plants." 

He said that bioterrorism is 
nothing new and that poisoned 
water supplies and decaying human 
or animal bodies are historical 

'We need to keep 
the panic down. 

An improperly 
handled threat is 

worse tha n the 
threat itself: 

-John Sylvester 
Member of bioterrorism panel 

forms of it. 
"What is new are the 

microbacterial diseases," Rickman 
said. 

Dunford supported Rickman's 
statements. 

"The idea of contagens is some-
thing we've dealt with for a long 
time," he said. 

Dunford com pared anthrax 
infection to other well-known, 
contagious diseases such as the 
Au . 

Some in attendance, including 
members of the medical communi-
ty, approved of the conference. 

"1 thought that the meeting was 
very interesting," said Carlsbad res-
ident Carol Matthews. "There was 
a lot of information presented that 
I was not aware of." 

Symptoms of inhalation ahthrax 
appear within one to seven days of 
exposure and antibiotics have the 
best chance 'of saving a life if 
administered immediatdy. A two-
day supply of antibiotics for 
830,000 people could be delivered 
within 12 hours. 

Panelists did not discuss how 
long it would take to distribute 
doses of medication to the about 3 
million people who live in the San 
Diego area. This led other epi-
demiologists in the audience to 
comment afterward that the gov-
ernment should rethinlc its strategy, 

"The information presented was 
misleading," said one epidemiolo-
gist present who declined to be 
named. "Even with a 60 percent 
survival rate, there is a 40 percent 
death rate." 

Despite the threat of biochemi-
cal warfare and the backdrop of a 
war in Mghanisran, Levine said 
people have never felt closer to one 
another - that in the face of hard-
ship, citizens unite and support 
each other, 

"Lately, there has been a sense 
of commonality; that we belong to 
each other," Levine said. "We are 
in this together."

Dedication: A representative from Gov. Gray Davis' office reads a proclamation 
officially dedicating California's observation of Nov. 11 to U.s. veterans. 

"Wars start, I guess, because we 
don't know how to love our ene-
mies," Baca said. "We're all told to 

love our enemies, and even if that's 
not possible, maybe we can at least 
act like we do."

Push to boost federal 
Pell Grants in jeopardy 

UCB'senate says no to nukes 
Senators demand end to UC nuclear research 

White House warns Congress that 
increasing awards may be too costly 

BERKELEY, Calif. - The 
UC Berkeley student senate voted 
Nov. 7 to ask the UC Board of 
Regents to stop nuclear weapons 
research at the nation's two largest 
nuclear weapons research labora-
tories, which are run by the uni-
versity. 

As .1 result of budget deficits in 
the Pell Cr,mt program, the \Vhite 
Il ou,e w'll'Iled last week that a plan 
to Illcrea,e the maXlIllum amount 
of llWlle\, 'I warded to students 
Illlght LlII · through . 

The U.S. I louse of 
Representatl\'es Jnd the enate 
both JPproved btl Is in October that 
would lIlcrca~e the maximum Pell 
Cram aW.lrd~ hy S250. The maxi-
ilium grant would become $~,OOO 
per ye,lr. 

llut With Congress focused on 
WJY, to combat tcrrorism and rousc 
the economy, money is tight and 
priorities have been altered . 

In a letter to Senate leaders, the 
While Iiousc's Office of 
.\Ian.lgemellt and .Budget said the 
mone}, that would have been allo-
cated for the increa e would be 
needed instead to cover budget 
shortfalls that were caused by 
growth in grant demands. 

The projecred increase is much 
larger than the $100 increase 
President George W. Bush pro-
posed earlier this yea r. The Bush 
administration argued for the 
smaller increase because of the 
slowing economy. 

Currently, tile maximum award 
of Pell Grants is $3 ,750. To raise 
the maximum award by $250, col-
lege lobbyists predicted that 
Congress 1V0u/d have to increase 
Pell Grant spending by $2.7 billion 
m 2002 . The budget of the pro-
gram is now abou t $8.8 billion. 

San Diego State University 
political sc ience professor James 
Conniff ,aid $2.7 billion is not that 

much money when it comes to a 
school budget. 

"You have to figurc that they 
just don't want to spend money on 
education," onniff said, referring 
to the possibility that the money 
may not be awarded. 

Pel I Grant are only given [0 
undergraduatcs. Eligibi lity is based 
on income and how many people 
are in a given household. Students' 
expected family contributions and 
the cost of colleges they attend dic-
tate exactly how much money they 
will receive. 

Maximum awards arc given to 
students who do not receive any 
contributions from their families 
and meet the other criteria. 

The Department of Education 
awards Pell Grants to approximate-
ly 4 million undergraduates each 
yea r. 

During the 2000-200 1 school 
year, about 8,900 SDSU students 
received Pell Grants, said Chris 
Collins, SDSU's assistant director 
of financial aid. 

"We welcome any increase to 
the Pell Grant program because we 
have a lot of needy students and 
their expenses are not going 
down," Collins sa id. 

When Pel I grants were estab-
lished in 1975, they covered 84 per-
cent of the cost of attending a pub-
lic university. Collins said that Jiv-
ing co ts, transporration and other 
miscellaneous expenses are increas-
ing faster than the federal fi nancial 
aid dollars to match them.

In an 11-5 vote, the A UCB 
Senate approved a bill to send a 
letter to the regents requesting 
that they renegotiate their con-
tracts "as a matter of highest pri-
ority" with Lawrence Livermore 
National Laboratory in 
Livermore, Calif., and with Los 
Alamos National Laboratory in 
New Mexico and also end nuclear 
weapons research at the labs. The 
labs are contracted ro the 
University of California by the 
U.S. Department of Energy. 

"There's a problem of silence 
on the UC Regents. They aren 't 
explaining what's going on," said 
ASUCB Senator Jessica Quindel, 
who co-authored the bill. "They 
are simply doing things, and it is 
not understood . why they are 
maintaining these contracts." 

Valerie Kao, a UC Berkeley 
junior who pitched the bill to sen-
ators, said students generally do 
not know that the University of 
California runs nuclear weapons 
labs. Kao said she learned about it 
earlier this year. 

But UC spokesperson Jeff 
Garberson said it is clearly open 
knowledge that the two labs have 
been conducting nuclear weapons 
research . 

The U.S. government has con-
tracted with the UC Regents to 
manage nuclear testing facilities 
since the I 94Os. 

hI would take strong issue that 

Fellows work directly with state 
legislators, the Governor's office 
and other constitutional officers, 

and the Supreme and Superior 
Courts, to develop public 

policies for the most challenging 
and diverse state in the nation. 

The programs offer a unique 
experience in policy-making and 

exciting oppor.tunities to jump 
start careers in public service.

it is secret," said Garberson, who 
had not read the senate bill . 

The labs have been prominent 
in the media due to recent contro-
versies involving their research in 
nuclear wcapons technology. The 
Los Alamos lab came under heavy 
scrutiny recently after a series of 
high-profil e security breaches. 

T he sec uri ty la pses led to the 
indictment of Wen Ho Lee, a Los 
Alamos scientist who later pleaded 
guilty to downloading nuclear 
secrets to an unsecured hard drive. 
Federal investigators failed to 
prove their initial charges that Lee 
was a spy for China. 

There has also been ongoing 
controversy at the Livermore lab 
over construction of the National 
Ignition Facility, a multibillion 
dollar laser that will simulate tile 
conditions of a nuclear reaction. 

Garberson sa id the regents 
are open and willing to discuss 
the contracts in a public forum, 
such as at a Board of Regents 
meeting. 

"In both cases [of the labs], the 
government asked them to do it, 
and the university has always been 
motivated by a sense of public ser-
vice and patriotism to help when it 
reasonably could," Garberson 
said. 

T he labs no longer design 
new nuclear weapons as part of a 
comprehensive test ban treaty 
signed by President Clinton in 
1996. It was never ratified by the 
Senate. 

The treaty all oca ted the 
weapons labs more money and 
resources to maintain and safe-
guard old nuclear weapons. 

While Garberson said it is pos-
sible for the university not to be 

involved in nuclear research, it 
would cause the re earch to be less 
effec tive because the quali ty of sci-
entists and engineers would not be 
as high . 

Earlier this year, the regents 
cxtended the contract period for 
both nuclear weapons re~carch 
labs, so it is unlikely there wi ll be 
a re-evaluation of the contracts 
soon. The current contracts expire 
in 2005. 

If the regents do not renegoti-
ate their contract, the ASUCB 
Senate will request that the 
regents write a lener "providing 
explicit evidence" as to "what 
interests arc bcing served by their 
management of these labs, why 
UC cannot or will not renegotiate 
[its] contracts until cxpiratiqn, and 
how maintenance of the labs will 
safeguard UC Berkeley student, 
faculty, staff and community 
members from future attacks." 

"This is about public informa-
tion," Quindcl said. "We need to 
understand why they are manag-
ing these labs. [The public] needs 
to know what the UC is involved 
in." 

T he ASUCB bill alleges that 
"by managing the development of 
the U .S. nuclear weapons arsenal, 
the University of California is 
associating higher education with 
the creation of nuclear weapons 
that are immoral and illegal in 
accordance with international 
law." 

Kao sa id she wrotc rhe bill in 
light of the Sept. II terrorist 
attacks, aying nuclear weapons 
should not be used for a nation's 
defense.

San Diego parks' natural tranquility attracts hikers 
San Diego is a suburban jungle - a maze 

of freeways that snake among tract-home 
ghettos and vibrant community centers. But 
punctuating the cityscape of new construction 
and Ider urban areas are patches of green. 

The land in San Diego County buckles 
and folds. ' and canyons are tucked away 
between suburbanized mesas. Mountains rise 
from the east. Many of iliese areas are parks: 
designated outpo ts of wilderness within the 
dense development. 

The trails that wind through the parks of 
an Diego can provide tranquillity and a 

sense of solitude in the midst of the crowd-
ed city; others are overrun with hikers and 
bikers and traffic that rivals La Joll a Vi llage 
Drive's at rush hour. Some are paved and 
easy to navigate; others send their visitors 
crashing through underbrush or straining 
uphill. The county's outdoor hot spots vary, 
and many are within easy reach of UCSD. 

Torrey P ines State R esen-e 
Just a few miles north of RIMAC on 

North Torrey Pines Road, where the gated 
communities and wooded bluffs give way to 
the wlIldy coastline, the entrance to the 
Torrey Pines State Reserve sits unassumingly 
at sea level. Once pa t the fee station and the 
first parking lot, the park road \vinds upward. 

About 8 miles of trails branch from this 
road. A handy map guides the always-numer-
ous hikers, who range from youthful parents 
with toddlers in tow - some of the trai ls are 
that low-impact - to Spandexed, Walkman-
toting power-walkers, to students out for 
fresh ai r and dramatic views. 

Torrey Pine ' trails feature a surprising 
varicty of terrain. The trees that give the 
reserve its name frame sandstone formations 
and all is under cored by the beach below. 

Through the woods: A hiker passes through an overhang of vegetation in San Clemente Canyon's Marian Bear Memorial Park. 

The park's phone number is (858) 755-
2063 . There is a $2 parking fee, and the park 
is open daily from 8:00 a.m. unti l sunset. 

Marian Bear Memorial Park (San 
C lemente Canyon) 

A dramatic contrast of man-made urban-

ization with the beauty of rare riparian land-
scape is visible in San Clemente Canyon, 
where the 52 freeway links Interstates 5 and 
805. 

It shares the canyon with Marian Bear 
Memoria l Park. A stream rushes para llel to 
the freeway. Paths cross and re-cross the 
stream, and forks slide under hangings of 
poison oak and low-slung branches of oaks 

and sycamores. 
The bu lk of the trail - especially the 

section between Genesee Avenue and I-80S 
- is flat and relaxing. However, the densest 
shade and greatest sense of isolation can be 
found west of Regents Road because the 
trai l winds th rough a light-dappled grove of 
trees . Of course, the trickling of the stream 
is nearly always eclipsed by the roar of cars

THE EDITOR'S SOAPBOX 

Lectures are no place for rude, idle chatter 
By ED WU 
Design Editor 

It starts with a trickle in the back 
of the huge lecture hall. 

Someone is ta lking to their 
friend, perhaps tryi ng to get a grasp 
on the material at hand, or, if it's 
Monday morning, recounting the 
events of the weekend . It really isn't 
that bad right now - at the volume 
level of a quiet whisper, perhaps 
only the people a row or two away 
are slightly distracted. 

T hen, however, another group 
sees that others have taken free 
license in disturbing the peace, 
and begin to chatter among them-
selves, leaning across the person 
in the seat next to them to relate 
something of the utmost impor-
tance to the person on the other 
side. 

Maybe it stops there - annoy-
ing and disturbing the concentra-
tion of a good number of people in 
a radius of a couple rows of seats .. 
But maybe it gets worse. 

Soon enough, the whole friggin' 
lecture hall is filled with the sounds 
of 5 percent of the people chatting 
to each other, making it nearly 
impossible to hear the instructor, 
who, Ollt of respect - respect! -
for the maturity and age of his stu-
dents, refuses to shush them like 
the kindergartners their behavior is 
apt for. 

The habit of a number of stu-

Hiking: 

dents holding conversations during 
lecture is deplorable. I realize that 
my stance may seem rather 
extreme; I find nothing short of 
absolute silence as acceptable 
behavior during instruction, but I 
am going to justify why. 

The first and most important 
reason is respect for the professor. 
Unfortunately, it seems that a great 
many students at UCSD find this 
motive marginally significant in 
any decision not to talk because 
they nullify this reason with, "Well , 
he's getting paidllt's his job/He's 
supposed to teach us, therefore, we 
have free license to act in what way 
we choose. It's not volunteer work, 
after all." 

I see no logical connection 
between the fact that the instructor 
is paid and the respect students 
should have for him. These people 
- these human beings - have 
taken the time to prepare lesson 

. plans and to study elementary 
material from years back just so 
they can impart the knowledge to 
their students. By showing up to 
class, the students have given their 
unspoken agreement to be taught. 
Regardless of how much the pro-
fessor is paid to perform his duty, 
the least students could do is have 
the respect to allow the professor to 
finish the job he started for their 
sake. 

Perhaps it is readily apparent 
when an instructor has not fulfilled 

which is within park limits. 

his end of the bargain and not pre-
pared adequate instruction. But in 
my four quarters here at UCSD, I 
have not attended one lecture 
where this has been the case. 

Second, the students around 
you who arc not talking and are 
actually paying attention did not 

These people - these 
human beings - have 
taken the time to 
prepare lesson plans 
and to study 
elementary material 
from years back just 
so they can impart the 
knowledge to their 
students. 

come to class to hear the students 
around them converse about the 
material at hand or thei r plans for 
the weekend . They came to hcar 
the professor. 

It takes a fundamental lack of 
respect for other students to carry 
on a conversation in the middle of 
lecture - an act of utter selfishness 
and arrogance that cannot be justi -
fied in any way. Many people use 
the excuse tha t everyone does it. 
This is where they are wrong. 

The proper functioning of a 

society ca n break down quickl y if 
even 2 percent or 3 percent of the 
populace decides to nout the law. 
Likewise, talkers in a lec ture hall 
cause a disproportionate amount 
of disturbance because the 
acoustics of the room allow the 
slightest whisper to carry front 
one end of the lecture hall to the 
other. 

The mentality of group culpa -
bility, however, brings me to my 
third point. The fi nal reason peo-
ple should keep quiet during lec-
ture is because the willingness of 
one party to talk lends a sense of 
safety to others in the lecture hall 
who wisb to start thei r own con-
versations. When students stan 
talking, they inspire any like-
minded individuals around them 
to do so as well. So not only do 
chatters' voices multiply acousti-
cally, they multiply in sheer num-
bers as well. 

I do not know what it is about 
my electrical engineering classes 
that make the students much more 
apt to chat there than in any other 
class. I guess it's the perception 
that the material the professor is 
covering is already in the text-
book, unlike a political science 
class where lectures are the prima-
ry source fo r material. 

The view that yapping is justi -
fied because the materia l is avail -
able elsewhere is absurd and self-
ish. While some people learn just 

fin e from StmlYlllg a te.\t hullk 01 
glancin g up every fe ll seconds 3t 
thc professor to recap 1Il3tcrJ:l1 
they al rea dy know, lIl:lny or tho,e 
attend lecture bcca usc thc), not 
onl y want hut also need to hC:lr 
the professor speak in order to ge t 
any grasp of the materia l. 

Thi s little article prohably will 
not ch'lIlgc the mindsct of the 
people who have no com punc-
tion s about talkin g in cbs,> 
alread y. Ilowever, the other 90 
percent of the peopl e in the lec-
ture hall, along with the professor, 
who can sympathi ze with my POSi-
tion who are usuall y too tim id to 
shush talkers ca n stand up al,(3l1l) t 
those who believe it is thei r right 
to converse th rough lecture. 

Ironicall y enough, rhe biggest 
fear I have impeding me from 
grabbing the attenti on of those 
talking and shushing thcm is a rear 
of offending the guilty parti cs. I 
imagine it is the same for other 
students in the class room. 

I would like nothing hett er 
than for any professor who reads 
this to understand the plight of 
the students who do not converse, 
and sUlllmarily point to and ki ck 
out offenders to silence in the lec-
ture hall. But that wo uld be tre,-
pass ing on the freedolll of stu -
dents to speak about their week-
end in lecture, wouldn 't it? 

Local trails offer beautiful vis-
tas and wildlife education 
Continued from page 9 

The best place to enter the park's system 
of trails is at the Visitors and Nature Center 
at the east end of Tecolote Road . From 
there, the trail is easygoing, and the vegeta-
tion is calming. In the last mile of the trail, 
it climbs steeper and runs along a creek.

munities. But off Bl ack Mountain Road 
and Mercy Road is an oasis of trees and 
coolly shaded hiking. 

Los Penasquitos Canyon's 3 miles of 
trails wind through 3,000 acres of Illsh pre-
serve. The hikers there are those in search 
of a hidden spot in suburbia and the rush of 
the Los Penasquitos Creek "falls" - really 
little more than a charming area of con-
striction in the creek's flat route.

Tecolote Canyon Natural Park 
Nearly 7 miles of trails spread through 

Tecolote Canyon, which is one of the 
largest canyoM in the county. The park 
within this canyon stretches its many fin-
gers from Mission Bay to Clairemont. 

Along the rims of the canyon are houses 
the values of which are largely due to their 
peering view of the park below, and the

Not in any major kind of way. I think a

It's not the most important thing in my

Right now, I guess, forei!,'l1 affairs. I just

Higher education and the prestige of a degree. 

The best thing about my major (political sci-
ence) is that it's a great, broad field and it's 
open to many perspectives, interpretations 
and theories. But the problem with it here, I 
think, is that its too specfic just to theory. 

The hump, because its nice - gets a lot or sun. 

War. No, that's not true. I don't really worry. 

Yes. I think it's obvious, men have different 
body strucwres than women, and that influ-
ences a lot of social things . 

A lot. Its my major. And I read the newspaper. 

Aside from right now, that we're at war, I would 
ay what's going on in the Middle East: me bor-

ders between me Palestinians and the Israelis . 

Yes. I think this idea of patrioti III ... I think 
that since it 's IsomethingJ that people are just 
taking on. And I think in the next few months, 
people won't feel as patriotic as they did two 
months ago. 

No, it's not intere ring at ulis point. I'm inter-
ested in the li\'es of my friends and my family. 

I don't really want to describe it because its kind 
of explicit. It was a very emotional dream. 

To get a degree.

The worst is that it's difficult. The best is that 
it's useful. 

The middle of the library. It 's quiet. It 's a nice 
area. 

Not much of anything. Money. 

Yeah. They just respond differently to different 
mings. Women are usually more sensitive; men 
are usually carefree, and they don't really get 
concerned about certain things. 

Not roo much . It's not my main concern right 
now - too busy with school. 

Mostly environmental lissuesJ . But I'm sure 
that will change as soon as I actually get a job. 
Right now it's ju t meaningless issues, really.

other than the extra securi ty. 

No, I'm roo busy with my own.

14 PORTS THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Swim team loses two 
Men lose to UOP and UC Davis, women split 
:By JOSH CROUSE 
Sports Editor 

It was a disappointing weekend 
for Triron aquatics when the 
UCSD men's swimming and div-
Ing team lost both of its road 
meets last wcekelUl while the 
women managed only a split. 

The teams opened with a 
rcby-only meet at University of 
the Pacific in Stockton, Calif. It 
was the first home dual meet of 
thc scason for the Tigers. 

UOP dominated both sides of 
the competition, taking nine of 10 
evellts from UCSD's men and 
capturing eight of the firs.t nine 
e\'ents on the women's side. The 
Triton men lost by a final of 198-
148 while UCSD's women lost 
2~0 - 1 60. 

Despite the dominance of the 
tirst-place finishes in individual 
cvents, the men's meet was very

wear a jersey, shirt, hat or any other 
Item of c10thlllg featu ring your 
tcams logo. For thosc of you who 
are a little more ad enturous, I 
advise you to invest in body paint. 
I othing sets the tone for a day of 
fun and merriment like body paint. 
It lets c\'eryone sitting around you 
know that you are a true fan and 
that vou are not someone to be 

mcss~d with. 
Now that you have properly fed 

,lilt! clothed yourself, it is time to hit 
thc grocery store en route to the 
pre-game tailgate party. While at 
the store, you should be very quick 
and precise with your purchases. Do 
not filrn into some annoying weman 
who strolls down every aisle with no 
true agenda or shopping list, JUSt 
looking for what strikes her. 

Buying food and drink have 
absolutely no simi larity to buying 
gear, in which the main purpose is to 
browse lmtil you sec something that 
strikes you. You should have a list 

close until UOP sealed the win 
with victories in the final three 
events, which were the 1,500-
meter free relay, the 400-meter 
medley relay and the 40-meter 
free relay. 

The only event that the Triton 
men managed to win was the 300-
meter breaststroke relay. Robert 
Small, Tad Nakatani and Luke Seed 
all combined for a winning time of 
3:00.96, finishing more than 16 sec-
onds ahead of the second-place 
TIger team of Tauny Drusys, Steve 
Chiaro and Joel Fatherree. 

UCSD's women's team also 
won the 300-meter breaststroke 
relay. The team of Lindsey Meeks, 
Katie Miller and Sandra Lopez 
edged Ollt the competition for the 
WIn. 

The Triton team of Heather 
Hearon, Elaine Engel, Mi ller and 
Jennifer \Nilson was also victori-
ous in the 400-meter freestyle 

al ready made out that includes some 
sort of meat to barbecue, a variety of 
chips, salsa, dips and drinks. 

You are on your own in deciding 
what you like in the other cate- · 
gories, but I am going to suggest 
that you take my advice about 
deciding which beverages to pur-
chase. I say that you should just buy 
the cheapest beer that you can pos-
sibly find - taste be damned. I say 
this because you know that as soon 
as you entcr thc stadium, you will 
be payi ng obscene amounts for 
cups of beer. You might as well buy 
the cheap stuff while it's undcr your 
control. That way the price will 
somewhat even out. 

Plus, you can buy more of it at 
the store so you can be drunk 
enough that you only need a few 
beers once you enter the stadium. 

The tailgate party is an essential 
part of any sporting event. 
Gathering in the stadium parking 
lot and busting out the barbecue 
and ice chest is a time-honored tra-
dition that should be adhered to by 
all who attend sporting events. 

A portable television or radio is 
a welcome addition to any tailgate 
party. It allows tailgaters to watch 
or listen to the pre-game show and 
get up to speed 6n the latest hap-

relay - the only other competi-
tion that the UCSD women won. 

T he second meet of the week-
end was just as disappointing as 
the first for the Triton men. 
UCSD lost to host UC Davis 
179.5-108.5. The women's team 
fared bener, defeating the Aggie 
women by a final of 197- 103. 

Individually, Seed was one of 
the lone bright spots for the men, 
winning both the 100-meter 
breaststroke and the 200-meter 
breaststroke to pace UCSD. 

Jennifer Watanabe won the 
women's 200-meter free and the 
500-meter free, Frances Tran won 
the lOO-meter fly and 2oo-meter 
fl y, and Lopez won the loo-meter 
breaststroke and 200-meter 
breaststroke.

penings with their team. Sitting 
with friends and discussing how 
your team is going to kick the shit 
out of, its unsuspecting opponents 
while sipping some suds and scarf-
ing animal fl esh always makes me 
smile, 

Once the tailgating is finished, it 
is time to enter the stadium. From 
here there are two possible courses 
of action. The sole determining 
factor in which route will be chosen 
is which stadium you are in. If you 
are rooting for the home team, 
keep reading. If, however, you are 
one of the brave souls who has 
decided to root for the visitors (may 
God have mercy on your soul), 
then skip ahead three paragraphs 
and proceed fr0111 there. 

So, you've decided to root for 
the home team. That is a fantastic 
choice. This gives you the license 
to be as loud and obnoxious as you 
want. Feel free to scream at the top 
of your lungs in praise of your 
beloved team. By the same token, 
feel free to scream horrible, horri-
ble things about the mother of the 
visiting coach. The coach will seem 
shocked and appalled, but he will 
be appreciative of it on the inside. 

As a fan of the home team, it is 
also your duty to let the governing

Basketball: 
UCSD overcomes big 
Australian team 
Continued from pace 10 
National Team. While physically 
gifted, the inexperience of these 
players was evident when going up 
against a more seasoned Triton 
squad. 

UCSD debuted four new play-
ers - three freshmen and one 
junior-college transfer - in the 
game. Freshmen Derek 
McDougall and Hassan Bassiri and 
transfer Jeff Oppenheimer put in 
solid minutes. 

Watkins, however, was easily the 
most impressive newcomer, scoring 
three points and pulling down six 
rebounds in his 22 minutes of play-
ing time. Standing 6 feet 7 and 
weighing 225 pounds, Watkins 
added a much-needed physical 
presence against the taller AlS. 

UCSD will officially open its 
200 1-2002 season at home against 
the University of Redlands on Nov. 
17 at 7 p.m. in RIMAC Arena. 
With games at cross-town rivals 

officia ls know when they miss a 
call. A few time-honored cheers for 
just such an occasion include "Get 
off your knees ref - you' re blow-
ing the game" and "Nuts and bolts, 
nuts and bolts .... we ... got ... 
SCREWED." 

The final thing that you must 
remember is that you are obligated 
to harass anyone who is sitting in 
your general area and is rooting for 
the other team. It doesn 't matter if 
your team is winning or not, you 
just have to give them shit. That's 
the way it is. Now that you ha\'e 
learned how to root for the home 
team, you can read on to the next 
paragraph and learn how to root for 
the visiting team, or you can simply 
skip the next two paragraphs. 

You're the brave 'soul who is 
actua lly rooting for the visiting 
team. I commend you. Hopefully 
you have taken the route of dress-
ing in little other than body paint 
to show your true team spirit, This 
will help you later when the home 
fans think you are a psycho. They 
will be less likely to beat you with 
empty beer bottles if you walk into 
their stadium with the other team's 
colors sprayed on your chest and 
your whole person reeking of alco-
hol. You must also scream obnox-

iously at every opportunity to piss 
off the home team. 

If, by some miracle, your team 
actually beats the home team, it is 
your duty to inform all home fans 
around you that they have lost the 
contest. Some of them might have 
been in the restroom.while the game 
was decided, so you will want to 
make sure that each and every one 
of them knows the true outcome. 

With the game done, it is time 
for the' forgotten tradition of the 
post-game party. This is usually 
held in the parking 10[ with the left-
o\'ers from the tailgate party. You 
simply eat, drink and walch or lis-
ten to the post-game show. This 
allows the rest of the crowd to si t 
through traffic and get really pissed 
off while you have a great time with 
your friends. Once the traffic has 
cleared, you can mosey on out of 
the stadium at your own pace and 
return to your home. 

I hope that this has been an 
informative article for y'all to read .

will. Pomona's inability to finish 
not only kept UCSD in the game, 
but eventually gave UCSD the 
W111. 

Other than the fateful 10-
minute streIch early in the second 
half, the UCSD offense also lacked 
the creativity and final touch that 
were so apparent throughout the 
season. 

Next up for UCSD is an NCAA 
quarterfinal meeting next weekend 
'Yith San Antonio's University of 
the Incarnate Word, which upset 
powerhouse Regis University 3-1 

in the first round of the playoffs. 
The Crusaders are ranked 

ninth in the nation and sport an 
18-1 record. They are led by 
senior Brooke Hopkins, an AlI-
American last year who came in 
third in the nation in points 
scored, with 57 . She is currently 
University of Incarnate Word's 
all-time leading scorer with 175 
points and also is the all-time 
leading goal-scorer. Sophomore 
goalie Missy Howard has also 
been a prescence for the 
Crusaders, averaging 1.52 goals 
allowed per game and posting six 
shutouts on the seaso n for 
Incarnate Word . 

The game is scheduled to kick 
off on 5 p.m. on Sunday Nov. 18 at 
UCSD's own Triton Soccer 
Stadium.

place that I could go home to and feel comfortable in. I gave Tobin a call 
after I saw his ad in the GUARDIAN and because I was familiar with him 
after living in the dorms. He not only helped me and my parents find a 
great place, he also cares about you, which is evident when he calls 
periodically to see how I am doing. He has been a tremendous help and I 
hope when I'm ready to buy property later in life I will have a real estate 
agent who has been as wonderful as Tobin! Calling Tobin is a no-brainer 
if you are looking for a place to live."

T he UCSD men's water polo 
team ended its regular season with 
a di sappointing 7-5 home loss 
Sunday to UC Santa Barbara. 

T he game had li ttle effect on 
the Trirons' position in the stand-
ings, but they still hoped for a win. 
The game marked the final home 
appearance of senior co-captains

I gO: UCSD sophomore Ashley 
Peterson hits a ball last weekend. After UCSD suffered a tough loss to UC Irvine on Nov. 4, the 

men's water polo team wanted to 
gain momenrum with a victory 
over UCSB going into the 
Western Water Polo Association 
Championship next weekend. 
However, the Tritons may have 
overlooked their final regular sea-
son game and were outplayed on 
Sunday. 

My ball: Triton sophomore Matt Ellias looks to pass against a UC Santa Barbara 
defender Sunday at Canyonview Pool. 

T he night before, the Tritons 
avenged their ea rli cr regular-sea-
son loss to UC Davis, dispatching 
the Aggies 3 -0 behind Stacy 
Dunsmore's 17 kills and Ohta's 43 
assists en route to a 30- IS, 30-26, 
30-23 victory at RlMAC Arena.

Division III ational Runner-Up 
tcam, as we ll as last year's squad, 
which qualified for the NCA:\ 
tournament in its IIr t se.l,on In 
Division II. 

. T he Ga uchos mounted a more 
balanced and effi cient attack from 
th e starr of th e game. Santa 
Barbara scored the first goal of 
the game and came out of the 
first period leading 2-1. In the 
econd quarter, Samuels scored 

to tie the game at 2-2 just 21 sec-
onds into the period, but the 
Gauchos quickly broke the tie 
and hel d a 4-2 Icad headi ng into 
halftime. 

In the third period, Santa 
Barbara took control of the game. 
The team challenged Triton 
goalkeeper Lance Onken several 
timcs and scored two goals in the 
period , while UCSD could not 
get the ball past Gaucho goal-
keeper Trevor Spence. The quar-
ter ended with the Tritons trail-
ing 6-2 . 

With many chances in the 
final seven minutes of the match, 
UCSD tried to mount a come-
back. T he Tri tons came within 
two goals with 45 seconds left in 
the game, but they could not 
come up with the tying goals 
against the strong Gaucho 
defen se. 

The Tritons had opporrunities, 
but failed to capitalize. UCSD 
earned six one-man advantages 
throughout the game and did not 
score during any of them. 

uln a two-goal match, going 0-
6 on advantages is always going to 
hurt you," Triton head coach 
Denny Harper said after the 
game. 

Although the Tritons had 
advantage six times, Santa Barbara's 
defense did not allow its opponent 
to penetrate. The Gauchos kept tlle 
ball on the perimeter where UCSD 
could not get a high-percentage 
shot. Spence made eight saves in 
goal for Santa Barbara while Onken 
made seven for the lntons. 

"Defensively, we played a 
strong game," said Santa Barbara 
head coach Joe O·Brien. "We did 
get lucky, however, coming up 
with everal tips and blocks of 
their shots." 

In their final game in front of a 
UCSD crowd, Samuels tallied 
three goa ls and Djapic had one. 
Freshman Brandon Borso also 
added a goal. On the other side of 
the pool , the Gauchos had six dif-
ferent players score. 

Santa Barbara, who is ranked 
10th nationally, improved its 
record to S-9, and the ninth-
ranked Tritons fell to IS-5 with 
the loss. 

Harper predicts UCSD will 
most likely get the No. 2 seed in 
the tournament behind Loyola 
Marymount University, which 
defeated the Tritons on Oct. 25 by 
one goal. Al though LMU will 
have the home advantage, Harper 
and the Tritons arc confident 
about their chances in the tourna-
ment. 

UC Davis fell to 10-11 in the 
CCM and 14- 1 3 ovcrall. 

I t was a roller coa ter season 
for the Tritons, who started the 
season 6-0 in CCAA play but then 
lost four of nine conference 
games. It was the Tri tons' heart-
breaking 3 -2 loss aga i nst UC 
Davis that inspi red the team to 
make a change. 

"We felt like it wasn't a match 
we should have lost," McFarland 
said . "It was a defin ing moment 
for us. T he pl ayers [then] ju t 
decided to be the best tea m they 
could be." 

It worked. UCSD compl cted 
the year with a six-game undefeat-
ed homestand, including a 
thrill ing }-2 win over fifth -ranked 
Cal State San Bernardino that, 
according to Woods, gave the 
team confidence that it coul d 
defeat anyone.

U CSD mocks out Cal Poly to advance to quarterfinals 

Colin Yoong·WoIff/Guoldion 

Go away: Trtton sophomore forward Knstln Jones fights off two Cal Poly 
defenders for possession last Fnday night at Tnton Soccer Stadium. 

By COREY HOLMAN 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD women's soccer 
team continued its quest for its sec-
ond consecutive National 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
Division II Championship, beating 
Cal Poly Pomona 1-0 on Saturday 
night at Triton Soccer Stadium in a 
first-round match. 

In their fourth meeting of the 
season, the Tri tons were a ble to 
squeak past the Broncos for the 
third time this season. 

[n contrast to the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
Championship game one week 
ago when UCSD dominated 
Pomona en route to a 2-0 win, the 
visitors quickly took control of 
the game and kept the Tritons 
under pressure throughout the 
game. 

"We didn't come out to play in 
the first half," Triton head coach 

Brian McManus said. "They threw 
everything at us, but the bottom 
line is they didn't score and I knew 
we had a chance in the second 
half." 

In the threatening first half, 
Pomona managed six shots and 
five corner kicks while UCSD had 
one errant shot and no corner 
kicks in the same time. Triton 
goalkeeper Kami Poma made 
three saves to keep the game 
scoreless. 

Traditionally tronger in the 
second half, the Tritons took con-
trol of the game for a short tiltle 
after the half and managed to core 
the game-winning goal. 

In the 52nd minute, Erika 
Alfredson capitalized on a mistake 
by Pomona all-CCAA keeper 
Katie Kreps, pouncing on a loose 
ball and scoring her 14th goal of 
the season.

Volleyball sixth straight tnatch • wins 
Tritons finish season in second place, earn first-round bye 
By KEITH DO 
Contributing Writer 

The UCSD women 's volleyball team 
capped its regular reason with resounding 
\\"111> over Chico State and UC Davis this 
\\cekcnd to solidify its second -place standing 
In the California Collegiate Athletic 
As>ociation. 

The ISth-ranked Tritons, who finished the 
year 17-4 in the CCAA and 22-6 overall, made 
thclr final push heading into the National 
Collegiate Athletic Association Pacific 
Regional tournament by defeating Chico State 
3- 1 at R[MAC Arena last Saturday in their sea-
son finale. The victory was the sixth straight 
for UCSD and the 10th out of its past 12 
games. 

Before the game, the team honored seniors 
Jamie \Noods, Kathleen Hentz and Laura 
Santerre, who played the final regular season 
game of their careers. 

managed to hold off a late Triton rally and 
eventually earned a 30-2S win in the third 
game. 

McFarland put the seniors back in during 
the fourth game, but changes were not immedi-
.lte. The Tritons and Wildcats battled during 
what began as a close game, with the teams 
trading point back and forth. Eventually the 
seniors' experience allowed the Tritons to pull 
ahead and finish with a 30-20 game win and an 
overall match win to secure UCSD second 
place in the conference. 

"This is such a game of momentum," 
McFarland said. "Once it slips away, it 's gone 
for good. The seniors went back and got the 
momentum back for us." 

Losing a game is unusual for the Tritons, 
who had won four of their last five matches 3-
0, and looked like they would add another 
shutOut against Chico State before the 
Wildcats rallied . Though it was only one 
game, Woods said that they need to play more 
relentlessly and finish teams off instead of los-
ing focus . 

The Tri tons domll1ated early, winning the 
first two games 30-IS and 30-11 before UCSD 
head coach Duncan ,\lcFariand, who saw that 
the game was under control, substituted the 
senior starters with younger players. After 
fJlling behind early, the Wildcats took advan-
tage of UCSD's inexpeflcnce on the court and 
came back to take the lead in the game. Chico 

"We know that a ridiculous loss like that 
could end up hurting us," \,voods said. "We did-
n't panic. We knew we were a better team. 
There was never an urgency, but we needed to

matchup. 

UCSD began to figure out the 
Australian style of play and,

mances of ick Christensen and

Kyle Moyneur, clawed back to 
within two points at the half. 

After the break, it became clear 
that the game now belonged to 
the Tritons. Ryan Rikansrud made 
a three-pointer in the Trjtons' first 
possession to give the home team 
its first lead at 36-35. Boosted by 
50 percent field goal shooting in 
the second half, UCSD never 
looked back on its way to an 
impressive victory. 

Christenscnled all scorers with 
20 points. Rikansrud and 
Cameron Jackson each added II 
points. Moyneur muscled his way 
to a team-high seven rebounds. 

A1S had an incredible size 
advantage - the team had four 
players 6-feet- I 0 or ta ller - and 
shou ld have domi nated inside . 
However, the physical play of 
Moyneur, Ryan Swed and fresh-
man Jordan Watkins minimized 
the effectiveness of the Australian 
giants.

and it fell right between her legs. 
I was following the shot and the 
ball was right there," Alfredson 
said. 

"Sure, it could be considered 
luck, but only a class player like 
Erika would have been there to put 
the ball away," said McManus 
about Alfredsons goal. 

The goal gave Cal Poly 
Pomona a sense of urgency as it 
began to see its cason slipping 
away. Pomona managed s i .~ more 
shots in the game, forcing Poma 
to make another three saves . 
Pomona also narrowly missed 
two cle:lr chanccs in the >crond 
half, coming up just wide hoth 
times. 

UCSD's dcfemc had an unusu-
ally weak game. While the SIX shots 
on goal were only two above the 
season average for the Tritons, the 
Broncos penetrated the defense at

I have noticed that a strikingly 
low percentage . of • 
Earth s population 
knows t~e proper 
way to view a live 
sRortinQ event. 

It seems iliat many pcople false-
ly assume that mere physical pres-
ence is all that is required to claim 
that they anended a sporting event. 
To all of you lost souls who have 
fallen prey to this assumption: Fear 
not, for I will help you. 

Preparation for attending a 
sporting event begins when you 
wake up in the morning. A good 
breakfast is key for maintaining 
energy throughout the grueling 
day. I usually start the morning 
with a few cups of coffee, some 
eggs and possibly some pancakes. 
Some sausage or bacon can also be 
a real plus. At the very least, try to 
choke down a bowl of cereal. 

Keep in mind that you want to 
save room for the tailgate parry that 
will take place before the gamc. 
The key is to fill yourself up 
enough so that you arc awake, fresh 
and full of energyi YOll just don't 
want to be too full. It is a fine line 
that many a fan have mistakenly 
crossed. 

Following breakfast, the next 
step of prcparation is the selection 
of gear. Your clotlling (or lack 
thereof) will completely set the 
mood for your afternoon. You can 
take the boring and conservative 
route and just wear your normal, 
everyday clothes. Personally, I 
think that is seriously weak. 

You should sport your team's 
colors proudly as you enter the sta-
dium. It is even permissible to wear 
the clothing of the team you will be
