C.lebl'mlon - The Vietnamese Student organization, in conjunction with San Diego's Viet -
namese community, celebrated the Vietnamese New Year yesterday at and around the UCSD 
gym, although the New Year actually begins on Wednesday. The opportunity was used to raise 
donations to help the 'boat people' from Vietnam, and the large crowd that attended listened to 
speeches and music during the event.

Medical Center 
in red; austerity 
plan proposed 
Some unable to afford care 
will be turned away 

By REX DALTON 
Jp«ifl'from the Sfln DieKo Union 

Awash in a growing sea of red 
ink, UCSD Medical Center ad-
minstrators told the staff yester-
day of a series of dramatic actions 
designed to convert this year's 
potential $6.2 million loss into a 
$1.6 million gain. 

The transfer of some patients 
from other hospitals to UCSD 
will be restricted to those with 
insurance coverage, officials said . 
Financial deposits may be re-
quired of some patients before 
they are admitted to the hospital , 
and trauma and emergency pa-
tients may be diverted elsewhere 
when the Hillcrest facility is at 
capacity, officials said. 

UCSD Medical Center's prob-
lem is that the number of patients 
who aren't adequately covered 
by private or governmental insu-
rance programs has reached 53 
percent of its entire patient popu-
lation, said Michael R . Stringer, 
the hospital's executive director. 

This meant that the pubiiC\y 
funded hospital lost $2 . 1 million 
during the first half of the fiscal 
year that started in July, officials 

said . If no changes are made, 
they said , $6.2 million would be 
lost by the end of the fiscal year. 

"U ndercompensated" patients 
- primarily poor people covered 
by the state Medi-Cal program 
and the state-funded County 
Medical Services program -
have overwhelmed UCSD, offi-
cials said . 

"We are at great risk of becom-
ing a county hospital all over 
again," Stringer said. 

UCSD took over the old 
county hospital in 1966, when 
San Diego County stopped ope-
rating it. Since then, UCSD has 
developed the facility into one of 
the more comprehensive medical 
centers in California - with ser-
vices in the region, like the burn 
center. 

And for the last few years , the 
institution has operated in the 
black with a nearly $260 million 
budget, despite carrying much of 
the county's burden as the facil-
ity of last resort for indigents. 

Stringer emphasized to serveral 
hundred staff members at inter-
nal meetings yesterday that 
UCSD will continue to playa

J erome Scott, a black free-lance journalist who has written for the Jackson 
Advocate, the Atlanta Daily 
News and the Charlotte Obser-
ver, offered his interpretation of 
Black American history and cur-
rent American politics in a lec-
ture on Tuesday. 

Scott blamed the inequities of 
American society, past and pre-
sent. on America's quest to turn 
a profit. He holds, for example, 
that the slave trade was fueled by 
the enormous profit potential of 
cotton which required very cheap 
labor. 

Scott then addressed what he 
sees as the next phase of black 
slavery - the period following 
the dismantling of the share-
cropping system in the '40s and 
'50s. Blacks were then thrown off 
their land and the squalid shacks 
they lived in were burned. Forced 
to migrate to the cities, blacks 
eventually became "wage slaves" 
and provided the cheap labor 
needed in factories to maximize 
profit. The advantage of the cit-
ies, according to Scott, was that 
blacks now were concentrated in 
groups and it enabled them to 
organize. "It was the basis for the 
development of civil rights," 
Scott said .

"The South and the black 
masses of the South [are] the 
very foundations of the econnmic 
might of this country," Scott 
said , "for it was the vast amount 
of wealth created through slav-
ery that set the conditions for the 
United States [to become] a 
strong economic power." Cotton 
was king on the international 
market and this enabled the U ni-
ted States to expand worldwide 
in power and prestige, he added . 

Scott further contended that 
the elimination of slavery was 
not freedom for blacks. The 
share-cropping y tem replaced 
the coercive force of whip and 
chain, with other inequities, like 
debt and unfair law . "It wa a 
y tem," he said , "that en ured 

Scott explained that the civil 
rights movement benefitted all in 
society . Heightened political 
awareness helped other move-
ments such as the student protest 
movement and the ERA . Scott 
pointed out that the plight of 
blacks throughout history ha 
not involved isolated events , but 
events interconnected within all 
of society. "When we are held 
down, you are held down." he

The fourth liver transplant 
operation attempted at the 
UCSD Medical Center ended 
last Wednesday with the death of 
the patient , prompting an end to 
the liver transplant program until 
both this case and the entire pro-
gram is thoroughly reviewed . 

The Northern Californian 
recipient wa a 36 year-old man 
who e name ha been withheld 
at the request of his family . He 
wa ' uffering from liver failure 
and was on the waiting list for 10 
week before a suitable liver wa 
located . 

He died due to evere blood 
loss about 10 hours into the 
operation. which was performed 

by a 17 member transplant team. 
Because this patient was the 

fourth liver transplant recipient 
(out of the four attempts) to have 
died since the program started in 
March of 1987, an evaluation of 
the case will be performed by the 
liver transplant program advi-
sory committee as well as other 
groups at the hospital. These 
include groups responsible for 
routine urgical review, accord-
ing to ho pita! pokewoman Pat 
Jacoby. 

No other liver tran plants are 
scheduled to take place before 
the review of the case will be 
pre ented and completed , which 
will take everal week . she said. 
The overall liver transplant pro-
gram will be discussed. and a t 
the pre ent time no decision 

regarding the program have yet 
been made. 

Liver transplants are among 
the most complicated operations, 
and take approximately 7 to 12 
hours - sometimes longer .

"EI Nino" to be discussed at 
University of San Diego 

Since 1983 when a series of huge 
winter storms battered the San Diego 
coast, the words "EI Nino" have 
become familiar in the media and in 
the language of Southern Californi-
an's , Most know the phenomena is in 
some way related to ocean water 
temperature, but few understand what 
EI Nino really is, why it happened, or 
if it will happen again . 

On Wednesday, Feb. 17 at 7 pm in 
room 204 of Serra Hall on the Univer-
sity of San Diego campus, "EI Nino" 
will be the subject of a talk by oceano-
graphers Dr. Tim Barnell of the

Dr. Forrest Miller of the Inter-
American Tropical Tuna Commission. 

Entitled "EI Nino - What's That?" 
the talk will provide the public with a 
simple explanation of EI Nino. Barnett 
will describe what an EI Nino is and 
why the phenomena occurs while 
M iller will discuss the impact of EI 
Nino qn~~e .Qsherie~ ofJ he we~t coast 
of the Umted States and Baja 
California. 

The talk is open to the public and 
there is no fee for admission . "El Nino 
- What's That?" is another in the ser-
ies of "San Diego and the Sea" semin-
ars co-spo nsored by the San Diego 
Oceans Foundation and the University

Med Center: Cutbacks are imminent training at UCSD from ordering expensive diagnostic procedures 
- such as radiology, laboratory 
and pathology tests - are being 
planned , officials said .

But the worsening financial

forced hospital administrators to

plan so they will make $1.6 
million. 

• When UCSD Medical Cen-
ter is at full capacity, it may go 
on "bypass" status for its emer-
gency room and trauma center,

may begin "reserving"both gene-

All of these are short-run 
methods to deal with the crisis, 
said Stringer, who added that in 
the longrun UCSD must develop 
its satellite hospital on the La 
Jolla campus and expand its 
outpatient services at the UCSD 
Medical Group facility there, as 
is planned in May. 

This has occurred rarely in the

occur more as a matter of policy.

patients "keep this place afloat ."

Stringer. 

Because UCSD operates so 
close to capacity, officials are 
limited in how many staff posi-
tions they can eliminate. 

One recent night, UCSD Med-
ical Center had 405 patients when 
it only operates 400 beds, offi-
cials said. The hospital is licensed 
for 423 beds. 

Stringer said there will be "a 
very small number" - possibly 
less than 10 - layoffs at this 
time, an undisclosed number of 
permanent positions will be eli-
millated through attrition, there 
will be extensive red uctions in 
the use of temporary help and 
there will be a freeze on hiring

care areas.

patients - called its 
"target" gmup - ah~ . , .. 
limit the number of

patients, so that it can 
continue to treat as 
many poor as possible. 

Employee salaries make up

The Bathhouses 
San Diego City Councilwoman Susan Golding 

wa on campu this week in isting that AI DS and 
bathhouse closings are not gay issues; simultaneous-
ly, the county upervisor were voting to prohib it 
"public" sex in those bathhou es . 

I f gay people need more reason to distrust and 
fear the city' attitude toward gay interests, they 
have it. 

AIDS is a gay issue because public attempts to 
deal with gay sexuality and its impact on the disease 
are uncomfortably reminiscent of old-style homo-
phobia for many gay men and women. Further, 
AIDS is an issue for a community in which vi rtually 
everybody knows omeone who has died an untimely 
death from the disease. 

If San Diego is going to make progress in 
protecting its citizens from the AI DS epidemic, the 
city and county need the trust and cooperation of 
the groups most seriously affected. Cooperation will 
not be won by narrow "legali ms" prOhibiting sex in 
the bathhouses without closing them. 

E en in an Franci co, with a go ernment more 
appreciative of the rights and needs of it citizens, 
the bathhouse issue became bitterly divisive, with 
many in the gay community feeling persecuted and 
ignored .

problem, The Band Play ed On. is at the UCSD and 
other book tores .) 

We don't know whether the bathhou es should be 
closed . We do know that if they are closed, the 
appropriate path is public health department actio n 
in a reasoned, public proces with ample time for 
legal challenges. Upcoming City Council con-
sideration of legislation which would shut th e 
bathhouses first and ask question later is un-
necessarily intrusive and divisive. 

Three Cents/Dollar 
The Ne w Yorker concluded a two-part series on 

the homeless in New York City last week . 
Not surprisingly, the attitude of the Reagan 

administration is a major factor in the inability of 
the city to adequately deal with the homeless; the 
federal role is mainly to tell cities that the problem 
needs long-term study, not money. This is a difficult 
concept to grasp for somebody with no food and no 
place to live. 

Perhaps the most shocking conclusion of the ser-
ies was that there are about a thousand homeless 
infants in the city. Homeless mothers are daily faced 
with a horrifying Catch-22: seeking shelte r at certain 
of the city'S hotels is considered by the state to be 
grounds for child abuse. se. 

During the last year of the Carter administration , 
seventeen cents were spent on social welfare pro-
grams for every dollar spent on the military. For 
. Reagan 's last budget, the figure was three cents. 

Think about that next time yo u see o ne of those 
jets fly by from Miramar. 

Forgive Ed Meese 
The nation'S number one lawyer, Ed Meese, 

didn't appear as scheduled at a University of San 
Diego conference last week. (A former USD faculty 
member, Meese period ically slums here.) 

USD was disappointed, we hear, but houldn 't 
j udge Meese too harshly. Having invoked the 
phrases, "I don't remember" or " I can't recall" 
somewhere in the neighborhood of 750 times to 
vario us ethics investigations over the last couple of 
years, Meese's memory clearly isn't what it used to 
be . He proba bly ju t forgot a prior commitment, 
like a grand jury appearan ce. 1m

Letters 
Bicyclists 
Abuse Law 
Editor: 

I'd like to address this letter to all 
readers who ride bicycles on cam-
pus . As a student who commutes to 
campus by car, I encounter bicyclists 
on the road every day. And every 
day I witness bicyclists' flagrant 
abuse of the law. 

Bic),c1ists . the law treats you no 
differently than i't does us automo-
bile drivers. Like us, you a re obliged 
to obey all traffic laws while operat-
ing your vehicle. That means obey-
ing the speed limit , stopping for stop 
signs and red ligh ts, and driving ca u-
tiously and courteously at all times. 

While on campus I have yet to see 
one bicyclist stop at a stop sign and 
yield to other traffic that has the 
right of way. I nstead, bike rs run 
right th ro ugh the intersection. This 
blantant disrespect for traffic law 
angers 'me greatly. Bikers, the law is 
there to protect all of us. When you 
break it, you're not only endanger-
ing yourselves, but also other drivers 
and other vehicles . The last thing I 
want is bicycle (a nd bicyclist!) parts 
tuck in my front bumper. But how 

can I drive safely if yo u don't too? 
We simply have to cooperate. 

I 've spoken to various campus 
police officers about this situation. 
Their response is always the same: 
"If I see a bicyclis t di obey a traffic 
law, I'll give that person a ticket. If 
I'm not there when it happens, there's 
not much I can do." The' problem 
doesn't lie with the police. We don't 
need cops posted at every intersec-
tion to monitor traffic. We sho uldn 't 
need police to enforce the traffic 
laws at all. Safety and com mon sense 
requi re each one of us to obey the 
laws; otherwise we have chaos and 
injuries . 

Bicyclists. I'm all for bicycle-rid-
ing. It's fun ; it's economical; it's 
non-polluting. But it's a nightmare 
for everyone else on the road as long 
as you continue to break the law.

people who have refuted to leave their sacred homelands in a reJion 
know as the lia Mountain I Joint Usc Area of northeastern Arizona.

Betty Tlo, a Navajo resident of Big Mountain and spokellpenon for 
the lawsuits plaintiffs, said at the news conference, "Forced relocation 
is a direct violation of the First Amendment rights of my people to 
freely practice their reliJion. We beliew the Creator has placed us on

proceeding since 1974 under "public law "3-S3 I," passed by Congress

We still have need for many more

I wonder why our campus is 
singled out of a ll the UC campuses as 
being unworthy of a fully supported 
Women's Center? 

It seems obvious to me that with-
out a full-time office position for the

the WRC has nowered at a level far 
below it potential effectiveness and 
campus need . 

Perhaps the new UCS D Commit-
tee on the statu s of Women (chaired 
by Philo o phy Profe sor Pat Kit-
cher, mandated by UC President 
David Gardner) will reco mmend a 
much needed upgrading of the 
Women's Resource Center program. 

In the meantime I urge people in 
the communi ty to co nduct their own 
perso nal upgrading ofthe center and 
to volunteer some of their time.

A booth for tudent complaints 
has been established by the 
UCSD Associated Students , the 
first time such a booth has been 
set up at a UC school. 

The booth, which began oper-
ation early last quarter, is open 
for 10 to 15 hours every week 
and change locations around 
campus. It can usually be found 
near the hump or at Revelle 
plaza. 

"The most common complaints 
concern the lack of quality social-
programming on campus, park-
ing hassles , and problems con-
cerning the bike and skateboard 
rules ," said A.S . State Lobby 
director, Thomas Kriese.

development of the booth. 
The booth is also important to 

the A.S. because it helps the 
organization to stay in touch 
with the students , according to 
Warren freshman senator, Tina 
Maher. 

"The A.S . council is reaching 
out to the students and staying in 
tune with their needs through 
this booth," said Mordecai 
Potash, A.S. vice president of 
external affairs . Potash manages 
the booth. 

Students can air their com-
plaints orally to the A.S. repre-
sentatives present or fill out a 
form, making the complaint more 
formal. However, the booth also 
serves as an A.S . information 
table and as an advice table, 
according to Potash. 

Tile A.S. representatives at 
the booth have information on 
student finances, student employ-

ment and the statewide UC Stu-
dent Association. 

Once complaints have been 
made, they are pursued by the 
A.S. council members or exter-
nal affairs senators. "Currently, 
three-out-of-four external affairs 
senators are following up on 
complaints," Potash said. 

Senators volunteer to handle a 
complaint and contact the appro-
priate administrators and depart-
ments to advocate the students' 
cause. However, Potash feels that 
the process could be improved: 
"The more specific students are 
able to make their complaints, 
the easier it is for us to act on 
those complaints effectively." 
According to Kriese, students 
can also take advantage of the 
portion of the complaint form 
which asks for suggestions on

the Democratic party has shifted 
to the right and that the '88 elec-
tions could be a pivotal point in 
history in which a third party 
make take root. 

The underly ing cause of such a 
phenomenon, according to Scott, 
IS the current state of the coun-
try. T~e economy is devastated , 
he said . "Three to six million 
people are presently homeless 
and the standard of living for 
workers is on a stead y decline. 
Yet, the government's attitude 
toward these problems has been 
to ignore them," Scott said.

Scott sees Jesse Jackson as having the ability to fracture the 
Democrat ic party and introducing a third major party into American 
politics. 
with these issues has been the 
Democratic party. However, 
SCOII said, the Democratic party 
has become so ambivalent to 
their traditional ideal s that Paul 
Kirk , chairman of the party, has 
announced there will be no plat-
form, just an open letter. Like 
the party itself, most of the call-
didates will not take a stand on 
t hese issues . 

Scott put forth the speculation 
that Jesse Jackson, by picking 
up many of the d ise nch'!n.ted • 
Democrats, coule do surprisingly 
well on Super Tuesday, a day of 
20 primaries, most of which are in 
the South . By winning a large 
number of delegates, Scott said 
that Jackson will have a loud 
voice at the convention and could 
be a decisive voice if the nomina-
tion is brokered. SCOIt expressed 
his confidence that Jackson will 
force the Democratic party to 
deal with the pressing socia l 

, 

issues. He even spoke of the pos-
sibility that Jackson could enter 
the convention with the most 
delegates. 

Scott, however, was skeptical 
that the party would allow Jack-
son the nomination . He further 
speculated that if the party re-
fuses to confront the social issues, 
Jackson might go outside the 
party and start a third one. 

Scott concluded his lecture by 
restating the theme - how profit 
continues,)o this day and age to 
demostrate higher priority than 
human life. "For profit ," he said, 
" they will make you ITomeless, 
they will prevent your children 
from becoming educated, they 
will let your mother die if she 
doesn't have a hospital card -
for profit everything will happen 
in this country unless we change 
priorities . [We must] put people 
before profit if we are to save our 
great nation." @]

Here's to your health 
The facts on fitness 

By KA TY SMITH 
Guardian Intrrn 

Exercising has become a favorit~ pastime for both 
recreational and health rea-

sons. In order to get the most out 
of your workout , here are an-
swers to some common fitness 
questions. 
How often should I exercise? 

According to the UCSD Phys-
ical Education Department, you 
should exercise at least three to 
four times per week (meaning 

"'tt I,fr onu 
ft\ .jilt her "' i tie 

2 'ft4rS " .. ~~ 
leel;"1~ sU'! 

every other day). Working out 
every other day will maintain or 

. if you arejust beginning, incre~se 
your stamina and level of fitness . 

Exercising any less than this 
will result in the loss of any pre-
viously gained endurance. Exer-
cising more than four times per 
week increases your stamina and 
level of fit ness. 
How lonl should I exercise? 

If you have already developed 
an optimal level of aerobic fit-
ness, the minimum recommended

workout length is 20-30 minutes. 
If, however, you are just begin-
ning an aerobic exercise pro-
gram, it is a good idea to start 
slowly. This means beginning at 
five to 10 minutes of workout 
and gradually increasing the dur-
ation of your workout to 20-30 
minutes . 

The purpose of the 20-30 min-
utes workout time is to activate 
your aerobic system. During the 
first one to two minutes of your 
workout you use your anaerobic 
system, which burns blood sugar 
(glucose). After this initial one to 
two minutes your aerobic system 
kicks in and is in full force after 
four to five minutes. The aerobic 
system then starts burning stor-
age fat and carbohydrates . 

A great advantage derived 

ucla Spotlight 
on the Homeless 

from aerobic fitnes s is sustenance 
of cardiovascular heaith. A heal-
thy cardiovascular system pro-
motes longevity of life. 
How intense should my workout 
be? 

To develop maximum aerobic 
capacity, the goal during exer-
cise is to achieve 70 to 80 percent 
of the maximum attainable heart 
rate. To calculate your Maxi-
mum Heart Range subtract your 
age from 220 (220-age equals 
MHR). 

To determine if you are exer-
cising intense enough, take your 
pulse during an aerobic activity 
and see if it is approximately 
equal to 70 percent to 80 percent 
of your M H R (pulse equals beats 
per minute) . 
Is stretchinl reilly important? 

Stretching is a very important 
part of any exercise program. To 
avoid injury, stretch for five to 
10 minutes before and aflerevery 
workout.

Before a workout, stretcnlng 
does just that , stretches your 
muscles and readies them for 
action . 

After a workout, stretching 
provides a means for your heart 
rate and temperature to s lowly 
come down to resting levels. 
Stretching also helps to keep 
your blood from pooling, which 
occurs if you just sit or stand 
after working out and can cause 
cramping or light-headedness . 
Lastly, stretChing also helps to 
avoid injuries or soreness. 
Where can I let more informa-
tion on fitness? 

A great place to get lots of fit-
ness information is at the Fitness 
Fair tomorrow at Revelle Plaza 
from II am to 2 pm . There will 
be many experts available to 
assess your fitness levels and 
answer questions on everything 
from psychological health to 
physical health. (Q]

Interdisciplinary Minor/Program of Concentration/Are. Study 

L aw and Society is an interdisciplinary program that emphasizes the complexity and interrelationship of legal: socia~ an~ ethic.al issues in their historical context . The Law and SocIety mmor IS avaIlable to all 
UCSD students with a general interest in law as a social institution as well as 
to students considering law-related careers. The purpose of the program is to 
enhance students' critical analysis of social and ethical issues related to law 
and of the legal implications and ramifications of policy and decision-making 
in their fields . To insure an interdisciplinary learning experience, students 
must include in their program at least one course from each of the following 
"core"academicdepartments: History, Philosophy, Political Science and Sociology. 

B ecause each college has different general education requireme.nts (rules for non-contiguous coursework and rules for overlappmg upper division course work), students should contact an academic 
advisor in their college to see how the Law and Society Program can best meet 
their college's general education requirements. Students who complete the program 
but do not use it for a minor, program of concentration or area study as part 
of the general education requirements, may elect to have a special notation on 
their transcript certifying their completion of the coursework.

lay·Sachs Disease is an inherited genetiC 
disorder of infancy. The affected baby develops 
normally until about six months of age, then 
destruction of the nervous system begins and 
death always follows by the age of four to five. 

Although Tay-Saw has been stereotyped as a 
disease carried by Jews, the fact is that anyone 
may be a carrier. A child must inherit 
two recessive Tay-Sachs genes lone from each 
parentI in order to have Tay-Sachs disease. 
Individuals with only one lay-Sachs gene lsucll 
as each of the parents of Tay-Sachs childrenl are 

known as carriers. Carriers are completely 
normal and appear as any healtlly individual. A 
recently developed blood test can now determine 
if someone is a hidden carrier who could produce 
cIIildren with Tay-Sachs. 

In high risk coaples - where both parents 
are carriers - there is a 25% cIIance with each 
pregnancy of having a child with Tay-Sal:hs 
disease. 

Dr. Gloria E. Bensussen of the California T ay-
Sachs Disease Prevention Program will be coordi· 
nating the screening at the UCSD Health Fair. Dr. 
Benussen has expressed a need for student 
volunteers to donate a couple of hOllrs of their 
time to assist with the screening. Those interested

The UCSD Triton women had no trouble keeping the ball away from 
UC Santa Cruz with their 82-42 win. 

Woman's softball 
loses opener 

Men and women 
dominate in 
weekend games 
By JONA THAN SCHRETER 
Sports Editor 

Both the men's and women's 
basketball teams took out a lot 
of fru tration this weekend as 
they trounced their opponents, 
the men defeating both Domini-
can College and UC Santa Cruz 
and the women beating Santa 
Cruz as well. 

On Friday, the Triton men 
·(15-8) trounced Domincan for 
the second time this season, 
133-60. 

Dominican (0-24) could only 
watch as nine Tritons scored in 
double figures . Andy Jedynak 
led UCSD with 20 points and 10 
rebounds. 

A rout from the ' beginning, 
Dominican would have done 
better sitting down if it were not 
for 29 points from Jeff Colley. 

See B-BALL, pale IS 

Over the three-day weekend the Triton Ultimate Frisbee Club 
participated in a 16-team tournament at UCSD. The Tritons 
finished in fifth place, losing to UC Berkeley in the quarterfi-
nals. UCSD finished 5-2 in the tournament, beating such 
teams as UCLA, Pitzer College and UC Riverside. Stanford 
University was the eventual champion, beating UC Santa 
Barbara in the finals. 

The UCSD Triton women's 
softball team opened their sea-
son on Saturday with a pair of 
games against Divis ion II Cal 
Poly San Luis Obispo at the Jew-
ish Community Center. 

Weekly Sports Calendar 
The doubleheader wa s the 

debut game for the two new 
Triton coaches Lin Adams and 
Lisa Bassi and proved to be a 
sl ight disappointment a s the 
Tritons lost both games, 1-0 and 
5-2 . 

Although the Tritons managed 
to play excellent defense , they 
could only squeeze seven h its out 
ofthe tough Cal Poly SLO pitch-
ing through both games. 

T he first game was a p itching 
duel between Triton Patty Hurtt 
(0-1 ) and a combination of Laura 
Fawcett and Lisa Johnson for 
Obispo. The only run was scored 
on an inside-the-park home run 
off a ball hit over rightfielder 
Stacy Sasaki 's head in the third 
inning.

DECEMBER 

Athlete of the Month 

Kevin Stewart 
Men's Basketball 
Forward 
Senior, Revelle 
Biology Major ........... 
Las Vegas. Nevada~ 

At 6 '3", Kevin Stewart would seem to be too small to play power forward for a 
college basketball team. But Stewart makes up in determination and hard work 
what he lacks in height, earning the respect of Triton opponents for both his 
scoring and rebounding abilities. 

In the month of December, Stewart led the Tritons in scoring in five of seven 
games. He is the team's scoring leader on the season with 14.3 points per game, 
and ranks second in rebounding with a 6.1 average. Stewart does nearly all of his 
damage directly beneath the boards, routinely guarding pl¥rs four or fIVe inches 
taller. 

"Kevin is a very clever player on the post, " says Triton coach Tom Marshall. "He 
always seems to find a way to make something happen. He is a fine athlete and 
good team leader. As a senior, Kevin has taken control througn example and 
discipline." 

Stewart ranks among the national leaders in field goal percentage, hitting 5B% 
of his shots. In December, he was named to the All-Tournament Team at the 
eight-team tournament hosted by the University of Redlands. He has now earned 
that honor in each of the three tournaments the Tntons have played in this year. 

The Tritons currently have a record of 11-4 and srill have an excellent chance of 
making the NCAA Division III Playoffs for the first time In the Universlty's history. " 
that happens, it is certain that Kevin Stewart will be leading the way.

HEALTH CARE - SOCIAL ISSUES 
Interdisciplinary Minor/Program of Concentration/Area Study 

THE HEALTH CARE-SOCIAL ISSUES PROGRAM offers students a 
variety of perspectives that enhance their ability to deal with complex 
social and ethical issues in modern health care. This program is available 
to all UCSD students with a general interest in issues related to health care 
as well as to students considering health care careers. By bringing together 
coursework from a number of academic departments, this interdisciplinary 
curriculum complements science majors and enriches students' preparation 
for professional and postgraduate education. 
THE MINOR CONSISTS of six courses. two required and four elective 
courses . At least four courses (three electives and Philosophy 122 which is 
required) must be taken at the upper-division level. Upper-division elec-
tives must be chosen from a department other than that of the student's 
major. 
BECA USE EACH COLLEGE has different general education require-
ments (rules for non-contiguous coursework and rules for overlapping 
upper division course work), students should contact an academic advisor 
in their college to see how the Health Care-Social Issues Program can best 
meet their college's general education requirements . Students who com-
plete the Health Care-Social Issues program but do not use it for a minor 
as part of the general education requirements, may elect to have a special 
notation on their transcript certifying their completion of the program.

UCSD 69, UCSC 65 

Saturday night's game against 
UC Santa Cruz (6-17) should 
have been another rout but the 
Tritons had trouble ear ly and 
managed to get ahead for good 
only in the final seven minutes. 

Shooting only 39 percent from 
the field, the Tritons let a 37-29 
halftime lead dwindle to a 53-51 
deficit with eight minutes left. 
Kirk Cramer hit one of only 10 
field goals in the second half at 
the seven minute mark to put the 
Tritons ahead again, this time 
for good. The final score: 69-65. 

Freshman Dan Troy led the 
T ritons with 14 points on the 
night , followed by Kevin Ste-
wart and Cramer who finished 
with 13 points apiece. Santa Cruz 
cou nted on 37 points from John 
Griffen to stay in the game, 
including four three pointers in 
the final minutes. 

With only three games left, a 
playoff spot is not plausible so 
they have another goal in mind . 
Should they win the next three 
games, finishing 18-8, they would 
equal the teams record last year, 
a team which included top gun-
ners Greg Kamansky, John Sain-
tigon and Brian Backens. 

"That would be an accomp-
lishment for these guys,'· said 
Triton head coach Tom Mar-
shall. "S ince the majority of the 
players are freshman or soph-
mores, finishing 18-8 could be a 
sign of what to expect in the 
future. " 

The Tritons finish their home 
games on Wednesday against 
Whittier. 

Women's Basketban 

UC Santa Cruz gave the 
women Tritons their best game 
ever as UCSD trounced their 
opponents 82-42. 

The Tritons shot a season high 
49 percent from the field and 
outrebounded UCSC 60-29. 
UCSD's Jill Koster led all play-
ers with 18 points a nd 15 re-
bounds. 

UCS D took the opening tipoff 
for a basket and never relin-
quished their lead . Four other 
Tritons scored in double figures 
besides Koster, including Chris 
McCallum (14 points) , Shannon 
Williams (12) Tracy Ragatz (10, 
including two three-pointers) 
and Bernadette Diepen -
brock (10). @] I 

I 
Softball 
Co~tinued from page 12 

Cal Poly SLO had three more 
hits in the inning but could not 
manage to score another run . 
The Tritons also stranded run-
ners in the scoring position for 
the final four innings of the 
game. 

In game two, Cal Poly SLO 
took a quick 3-0 lead off Sasaki 
(0-1) in the first inning. 

The Tritons scored their first 
run of the season when Michelle 
Flaska scored on a passed ball in 
the seco nd inn ing. Michelle 
M under scored the seco nd run in 
the third inning after reaching 
base on an error. 

After a rough start, Sasaki 
settled down, allowing only three 
more hits, including a fourth 
inning homerun by Lisa Voss, ' 
ironically hit over the head of 
H uru , who was playing left field . 

Cal Poly SLO' Mary Surci 
closed out the game to earn her 
first win of the season .
