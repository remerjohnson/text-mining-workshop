ActiVists from both ides of the

At UCSD, abortion rights

Briana Simmons, an Eleanor

Organizers said they noticed no

A.S. Council to oppose 
CRENO initiative 

By CLAYTON WORFOLK 
Senior Staff Writer 

fter months of infornul dl -
cus Ion and plalllllllg, the A .. 
CounCil unanimously passed an 
offiCial resolution oppo~ing the 
Classltlcatlon of Racc, ElhlllClty 
:Jnd I anonal Origin lIlitlatlve, 
which IS slated to appear on the 
March 2, 2004, aliforlll3 prima-
ry eleeri n ballOt. 

The CREN initiative, 
which would amend California' 
constitution to prohibit the 
"inquiring, profiling or collect-
ing" of "race, etlmicity, color or 
national origin ... data on govern-
ment forms," has sparked COntro-
versy within the U academic 
community since American Civil 
Rights ommiltce Chair and UC 
Regent Ward Connerly ubmit-
led the proposalla t year. 

A vocal opponent of affirma-
tive ac ti o n policy, onnerly 
championed t 996's successfu l 

Proposition 209 initiative, which 
banned preferential treatment 
based on race, sex, color, ethnici-
ty or national origlll III tate 
admission and hiring policie . 

i\lembers of the .S. Council, 
including President Jenn Brown, 
Commissioner of Diver Ity 
Affairs David Mitchell and 
Commissioner of 
Communications avneet 
Grewal, have been vocal in their 
oppo ition to the REN lIutla-
tive and have organized meetings 
for a No on CRE 0 coalition at 
U SO. 

Ilowever, the resolution 
pas ed on Jan . 22 was the 
Council's fir t formaltatement 
concerning the issue. Last year's

By CAELLE FAURE 
Associate News Editor 

The UC Student Assoc\3tion 
has revised its 2002-03 budget 
thiS month to scale ItS deficit 
down to about 600 from the 
onglllal $17,000 deficit drafted In 
October 2002, which had eliCIted 
disapproval from vanous UC 
ca mpu e and associations. 

One rea on for Ihe SyS-
temWide contention over the 'N-

stipends to Chair Stephen Kla 
and recently resigned Vice-Chair

published in the Dady Bnll1l prior 
to his unexpected resignation on 

Jail . t I , eal cited the lIeed for a 
stipend as an Issue of acceSSibility, 

explaining that he worked other

"A lot of people have taken

TIIURSDAY. JANUARY n. 2001 THE U 0 GUARDIAN NE\,(/~ 

UCSA: Despite funding shortfall, campaigns to continue, according to KIa 
conrinued from page I 

receiving $4,200 and $3,000 per 
ycar, respectively. eal, who cited a 
difficult financia l situation as parr 
of his reason for resigning, has 
bcen replaced by UCSA's ex-
Campus Action Committee chair 
and UC Santa Cruz undergraduate 
snldent Sabina Gonzales. 

Another expense that pushed 
the UCSA into the red was its dcci-
sion to hire a new staff member for 
a University Affairs position to bc 
shared with the Counci l on Student 
Fees, for which UCSA all ocated 
$5,250. 

Originall y, these new expenses 
pushed UCSA's budget to about 
$17,000 in deficit. The UCSA's 
budget must bc approved by at 
least one-third of thc University 

of California's tudent associa-
tions, including graduate associa-
tions, to pass, but Illany of the 
campus-based associations voiced 
disapproval of UCSA's increased 
spending in a time of budget cuts. 
Associated Students of UC Davis 
rejected the budget in December 
2002, whilc UCLA's 
Undergrauuatc Students 
Association Council and Graduate 
Student Association criticized the 
stipends. requesting a Illore 
explicit budget. UCLA and UC 
Irvinc both formally objected to 
the budget. 

According to Klass, many cam-
puses wcre paying UCSA well 
below the recommended minimum 
in fees . UC Davis ubsequently 
raised its donations after its 

Associated Students calculated that 
if they were to pay the recommcnd-

" A lot of people 
have taken wind of 

it and blown it out of 
proportion. " 

- Stephen KJass, UCSA Chair 
and A.S_ Vice President External 

ed fees, UCSA's deficit would be 
cut in half. 

UCSD's Associatcd Students 

contributed $23,625; the GSA i~ 
expected to contribute $5,000, but 
the amount had not becn official-
ized by the time of the January 
budget draft. Neither association 
opposed the UCSA's budget, nor 
did they raise their contributions 
significantly. 

After undergoing several revi -
sions, UCSA reached its tinal bud-
get on Jan. II with a $6t4 deficit by 
collecting overdue and increased 
payments from individual campus 
associations, by collecting a debt 
from the UC Office of the 
President for UCSA's collective 
bargaining, and by cutti ng UC A 
staff travcl and office expenses. 

"The important aspect of this 
budget is that UCSA has taken all 
these comments into considera-

tion," Klass said. "We're now try-
ing to reform our process so that 
associations ca n have more say." 

I\ccordlllg to Klass, UCSA has 
accumulated surplus over the IJ~t 
few ycars, and the current delicil 
should not affect UCSA's current 
campaigns. 

"We only made cuts where we 
were sure that thme monie~ would-
n '( have to be replaced later," Klass 
said. 

The UC A IS currently contlllll-
ing its" 0 More Tuition Incre;lsc" 
campaign In response to further sug-
gestion of UC fce increases made 
by the governor this month.

CRENO: Resolution contends racial and ethnic data 'essential' for outreach 
continued from page r 

TIle A.S. resolution contends 
that "racial and ethnic data are 
essential in demonstrating the need 
for programs such 3S olltreach to 
group underrepresented in higher 
education," and that "CRE will 
blind alifornia to cl(isting racism, 
dlscrimll13tion and social inequali-
tics." 

The resolution also states that 
UC D outreach prob'Tams such as 
the Stuuent-Initiated Outreach and 
Recruitment Commission, the 

Early Academic Outreach Program 
and the Office of Academic 
Support and Instructional Services 
"may be detrimentally impacted 
financia lly by a loss of enrollmcnt 
data" if the CRE initiative pass-
es. 

According to A.S . Ice 
President Internal Kevin I [su, who 
submitted the resolution to the A.S. 

ouncil, campus outreach pro-
grams work toward ecuring stu-
dent divcrsity of all types at UCSD. 

"UCSD i the least diverse of 

all the UCs," Hsu said. " If you 
can't track student representation, 
you can't tell where [recruionent 
and retention] efforts need to be 
made." 

The rcsolution claims that 
"retention efforts are crucial to 
improve an unfriendly campus cli-
mate," citing data from a 1997 
Quality of Student Life survey and 
a 1999 College Student 
Experience Questionnaire, which 
found that only 24 percent of 
black students feel a sense of 

belonging at UCSD compared to 
49 percent of srudents overall. In 
addition, "44 percent and 62 per-
cent of African-American students 
feel their academic and ocial 
experiences, respectively, have 
been negatively affected by ethnic-
Ity." 

The rc olution also c1allns that 
CRENO will "limit the effective-
ne s of researchers and public 
health policies" at UCSD and else-
where by interfering with the col-
lection of medical research data.

UCSD's parking 
plans need a 

twofold process 
It is no secret that UCSD is starting to 

bust at the seams with students and their 
cars. Every year, UCSD admits more stu-
dents than campus facilities can comfort-
ably serve. The good news is that there is a 
plan to help expand this campus in order to 
accomodate students, staff and visitors. 
The bad news is that it may not actually 
improve life for undergraduate students at 
UCSD. 

The UCSD Master Plan is a long-range 
vision for consrrucrion at UCSD. Tfie 
plans contained within it are already well 
under way with new buildings springIng up 
all over campus. As these buildmgs appear, 
" " parking spaces disappear at an even 
greater rate, forcing more students to park 
on UCSD's inconvenient East Campus. 
But there is a method to the madness: It is 
all a part of the UCSD Master Plan. 
According to the plan, by the year 2005, all 
undergraduate parking will be on East 
Campus. 

There is already a great deal of parking 
on East Campus. The students who choose 
to park there are making a trade-off: In 
exchange for parking, they are sacrificing 
the afety of their cars and their contents, as 
well as the pos ibility of spending less than 
20 minutes getting to class after arriving to 
school. 

If the administration plans to eventual-
ly move all undergraduate parking to this 
remote part of campu , it needs to do two 
thing. Fir t, the administration needs to 
plan for increast!d security in this part of 
ca mpu!. 0 students don't have to worry 
about their cars being stolen while they 
are 111 class. econd, the admilll tration 
needs to plan to expand and improve the 
shuttle system. Shuttles will have to run to 
every lot on East Campus, and they will 
need to run 24 hours a day because of the 
aforementioned safety issue. Many stu-
dent!. stay on campus tudying or 1V0rking 
WIth tudent urga nizatiom after thl.: East 
Campus parlung shuttles stop running at 
1:15 a.m. 

WIth these considerations, the UCSD 
Master Plan can fulfill its potential to make 
UC D a more convenient place for higher 
learning.

SUV's and drugs not tied to terrorism 
Ads convey convoluted messages on money 

By SAM WILSON 
Staff Wnter 

Last January, pundit Arianna 
lluffington and a Hollywood think-
tank called The Detroit Project 
relea ed a pm of ads linking SUV 
ownersh ip With terrorism. The ads 
appeared for six days in Detroit; 
Washington, D.C.; ew York; and Los 
Angeles. One of the ads about a hypo-
then cal UV owner named "George" 
describes the flow of money from an 
SVV owner's high gas bills at the 
pump, to a rich Saudi oil baron, to the 
hJnd~ of al Q~cda via contribuuons to 
tcrrort~t organlZ3uons, Itke the chan-
tJble contnbuuolls that ended up In 
the hJnd~ of 9/1 1 hiJackers. 

-J11e ads seem a bit unfair. Surely 
America's heavy dependence on for-
eign Oil IS due in part to the publtc's 
taste for huge, inefficient "light 
trucks," wluch accounted for 51 per-
cenl of vehicle sales last year. But 
blallung a specific ~egment of the con-
SUlllcr popula uon for our broad for-
"'gn entanglements is ridiculous. After 
all, the U.S. government has directly 
trained and funded Taliban forces, as 
well as sold weapons to Iraq when it 
was known that they were using chem-
ical weapons (defined by the admirus-
tration as a weapon of mass destruc-
tion) against its own Kurdish popula-
tion. Furthermore, the V.S. govern-
ment to this day supports a military 
presence in a monarchy caJled Saudi 
Arabia at a cost of $60 billion per year. 

But lots of advertisements ma~e 
ridiculous claims. If an ad seems hyper-
bolic or unfair, srudents of social psy-
chology are taught to ask, "Compared 
to what?" It eems fair to compare the 
ad to Its source matenal, a series of ads 
produced by the Office of National 
Drug Control Policy and hankrolled 
by the federal government. These ads 
link buying drugs to terrorism. and 
they make the Huffington spots look

NATIONAL 
like scnpture with thiS manipulative, 
unfair claim. 

The first ad that linked buying 
drugs to terrorism was one of tWO anll-
dnlg ads that debuted dUring the 2002 
Super Bowl, and was qUlclcly yanked 
off the air due to publtc outcry. 
Rubbing shoulders with Budweiser 
commercials, one of these ads juxta-
po ed actUal images of terrorists with a 
picrure of a boy smoking a joint. The 
two J 0- econd spots cost S3 million. 

Si nce then, the controversial com-
mercial has been rcplaced by a more 
sober series of four spots titled "Nick 
and Norm," wherein a pair of middle-
aged white men in suits discuss drugs 
and terrorism. The younger, swarthier 
nun employs a variery of wishy-washy, 
morally relative arguments trying to 
justify his hypothetical dope purchases. 
In one spot, he ponders if it's oleay to 
uppo" terrori m "a little bit," and in 

another spot insi ts that the is ue is 
"complicated." I lis fair-haired com-
rade, who looks more than a little like 
an older version of Lovelinc' Dr. 
Drew, peal<s with unbridled confi-
dence that drug money funds terror. 

putting all argumellls soundly to rest 
with the persuasive subdcry of a llUll 
telling a 4-year-old about God. 

The argument rests on the fact that 
the Taliban, which harbored al Qaeda, 
used heroin production as a means of 
income. Another truism taught to 
social psycholo!,'Y students is that "cor-
relation is not causation," alld a broad-
er sample of heroin -producing coun-
tries produces little proof for a broader 
causal link between heroin and terror-
ism. According to hflp:l/7vww.w/Jlfr-
housrdnlgpolicy.gov, 60 percent and 24 
percent of heroin seized in the Umted 
Srudents comes from olumblJ and 
Mexico, respccltvciy. In 2001, LJOS 
and Burma were the chlcf OplUlll gn)\\ -
er , neither of which ha~ been Identi-
fied as a terrorist threat by thc Unltcd 
Statcs. On the othcr hand . 1ll .lll )' 
nations like Alg(·rio and LlbYJ, whi ch 
appear repeatedly as basc; of operattun

drug exporters. 

In the year 2000 , Afgha nl~tJll \\'as 
the world's chief opium grower. In J ul ), 
of that year, the T.llthan hanned poppy 
production, burning down herolll 13 bs 
and jailing users until they agreed to 
switch crops. 111cir suprcme leader, 
Mullah Mohammed Omar, issued all 
edict stating that opium production 
was contrary to the beliefs of Islam. 
These are not the logical actions of a 
state attempting to rai c money for ter-
rorist actions through drug produc-
tion. rn one year, opium productlon 
fell 97 percent, according to the Whitc 
House.

TIIURSDAY. JANUARY Z3. 200) 

Ads: Spots ignore weak link 
between drugs and terrorism 

conrinued from page 4 
making terrorism a more attractive 
option for young men in this des-
perately poor country. 

The link between drugs and ter-
rorism becomes far more tentative 
when acrual drug-use patterns in the 
United States are considered. The 
ubstance Abuse and Mental Health 

SelVices Administration reports that 
0.1 percent, or one-thousandth of 
Americans over the age of 12, used 
heroin in 200 1. Not much of a tar-
get audience for a Super Bowl com-
mercial. More than seven times as 
many (957,000) in the same age 
group had u ed the opiate oxycon-
tin, a legal painkiller which many 
doctors claim can be every bit as 
addictive as heroin. Even asslIlning 
that a buyer could find Afghan hero-
in on the streets after the 2000 
poppy ban. all they would have to 
do to cut off any possible funding to 
the Taliban is to switch to oxycon-
tin, made by Purdue Pharma in the 
United States. The ads do not men-
tion that. 

Although the current table-talk 
spot rcmain vague, the Super 
Bowl SpOt madc its focus clear 
through images. The drug user tn 
that ad was not shouting up, but 
rather smoking a joint. This makes 
logistic sense, si nce marijuana is by 
far the most commonly used illegal 
drug in the United States. It is also 
nearly impossible to link to terror-
ism with the vast majoriry of pot 
smoked in the United States grown 
in Cana.la, Mexico and domestical-
ly. Most home-growers in 
Tennessee would chuckle at the 
idea that any of their profits end up 
in the hands of foreigners of any 
stripe. The fact is that from bath-
tub methamphetamine and hydro-

ponic weed to diverted pharmaceu-
ticals and GI-IB made from indus-
trial cleaning materials, a substan-
tial portion of the V.S. drug market 
has absolutely nothing to do with 
any foreign source. The ads cer-
tainly do not mention that 

T he attempt to link drugs to 
terrorism cannot be construed as a 
public health message because it 
makes no attempt to educate; all 
attempts at meaningful dialogue by 
the dark-haired character are dis-
missed by the unquestionable repe-
titions of his companion, sans evi-
dence. They are propaganda pieces 
meant to link drug use to a foreign 
menace that does "things so awful 
that we can't even conceive of them 
yet." 

Furthermore, the spots were 
intended to shore up support for 
the war on terror among parents 
worried about the dangers that 
drugs and drug-related crime pose 
to their children. With drug reform 
measures on the ballots in states 
like Nevada and Arizona in the 
2002 elections. the e spOts deliv-
ered a powerful political message 
to voters. By fallaciously linking a 
domestic Issue like punishment of 
drug offenders to a broader Inter-
national agenda, the e ads helped 
quiet an important debate about 
the way our sociery deals with con-
sensual crimes. AI though many 
find campaign ads offensive, at least 
they are paid for by private money. 
These drug sPOtS are slickly pro-
duced, issue-focused parti an pro-
paganda paid for by the federal 
government. They represent an 
abomination of democracy. the use 
of public funds in an attempt to 
sway public opinion and distorted 
politics.

Review 

THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION S 

Alumni contributions not cutting it 
If faculty finds funding, donations will come 

horse's 
mouth 

EdWu 

T he ongoing recession has hit UCSD's pocketbook in two ways, the first 
being reduced funding from a 
state budget deeply in the red, and 
the second from reduced dona-
tions from private sources. To off-
set this. UCSD Development 
(also known as the fund-raising 
office) has been trying to attract 
alumni donations back to the 
school. 

By every indication, UCSD 
has quite a bit of room to grow; 
despite its rankings as a presti-
gious universiry from any number 
of sources, VCSD has quite an 
ugly number for its rank in alum-
ni giving: 188th in national doc-
toral universities out of some 250. 
For some reason , people who 
graduate from VC D have not 
seemed to find the inclination to 
give anything back to their 
school. 

A number of reasons have been 
given for this discrepancy - the 
first and most oft-heard is the fact 
that the school is very young. and 
did not even graduate the bulk of 
its alumni until about 15 years 
ago. This writer has stated before 
that this excuse in other arenas 
(namely, undergradu:lte culture) is 
not only misleading, but is dan-
gerous because it encourages 
complacency with the status quo. 
Many alumni elsewhere do begin 

!,riving straight out of college. 
UCSD's rates are not just low, 

they are nothing short of atro-
cious. They have gotten worse, 
not better. since 1998, when US 
NtWS lind World RtpOI1 reported 

an II percent giving rate, as 
opposed to the current 9 percent 
rate (and this is not because of the 
recession - it was 8 percent in 
2000). Not even VC Davis's num-
bers hit the single digits. 

Some in VCSD Development 
believe that we will never hit fig-

loyalty, the college system 

ar athletiCS. " 
ures around the 20 percent mark 
that other large public schools 
garner until we have a better foot-
ball or basketball team. This may 
well be true, but one would hope 
that envy of schools with promi-
nent sPOrts programs will not 
blind school officials to what 
makes UCSD unique as a public 
school : its focus on academic 
excellence over athletics. 

ow, this is not to ay that 
we're entirely too far behind; 
UCLA rings in with all of 12 per-
cent, Berkeley with 17 percent, 
and both have very prominent 
national sports programs. But the 
recent push (and subsequent 

demand for funding) for DlvlSlon 
[] athletics highlight; the fact that 
there are many on campu~ who 
would enjoy a shift to national 
athletics, both for the prominence 
and the money. 

What this school hzs prided 
itself on in the past. however, was 
exactly its lack of athletics. The 
founding faculry was reluctant to 
authorize athletics at all after hav-
ing seen the blood-thirsry cu lture 
and demands on acadelnlcs a 
school with a national sports pro-
gram has. And for many students, 
the lack of athletic scholarships at 
VCSD is still a point of pride. 

For that matter, what instills 
pride in most UCSD students 
about their school has little to do 
with rabid loyalry, the college sys-
tem (unfortunately. because tn the 
'80s, they were a centerpiece of 
school emotion), or athlencs. It 
has to do With the qualiry of their 
bioengineering program, lh~ 
quality of the politica l science fac-
ulry or the fact that they bciong to 
a first-rate academiC tnstlttlttOll . 
Or at least they have that feeltng 
as wide-eyed fre~hmen. 

What should UCSD 
Development be fOCUSing on, 
then. when they go after aluml11: 
A few years ago, they had prtnted 
out cards that read "proud to be 
UCSD," with the visages of uch 
UCSD alumni as the foundcr o t' 
MP3.com and the actor who 
played the father on "Fresh 
Prince of Bel Air." ow, it' nice 
to know that there are (somewhat) 
prominent people who come out 
of UCSD, but the entire problem

with this tactic is perhaps illustrat-
ed by John Valva, director of alum-
ni relations: "There's o nly one 
thing alumni have in common, and 
rhar's UCSD." 

o the end re ult IS tha t we 
have a onc- ize-flt,-all approach 
to the unique culture that is 
UCSD (and the culture this writer 
is referring to is not the one of 
apathy) : celebrity and sports. 
What we have is a university with 
fiercely independent academic 
departments that excel at what 
they do in research, and under-
graduates who come to the school 
precisely because of these acade-
mics. The problem with pride is 
not in the lack of a sports program 
or the age of the school. Despite 
the fact we have an academic cul-
ture to be proud of, we do not 
engage undergraduates in it effec-
tively. This is no doubt a function 
of the size of the university; after 
all, with class sizes a they are, it's 
rather difficult for a professor to 
make it seem like the university 
has done a service for the average 
undergraduate, rather than the 
other way around. 

And it i preci ely that feeling 
that a student owes omethmg to 
the professors and their school and 
its future tudcnts because they got 
something intangible out of their 
experience here that i, the neces-
sary spark for both prIue and gen-
erosity.

This, of course, can nut be

emphasizing to professors and 
deparonents who teach large lec-
ture classes that their responsibili-
ties have to scale witll class size in 
order to reach and engage students. 

In short, it is the faculty' 
responsibility to ensure that under-
graduate at the univer ity are get-

because as the guardians of acade-

they form the basis for the eccen-

Texas A&M criticizes 
MLK 'ghetto party' 

Event intended to be in 
good fun, students say 

By YVONNE LIM 
Daily Texan (U. Texas-Austin) 
(U-WIRE) AUSTIN, Texas 

- Texas A&M officials canceled 
and are investigati ng an off-cam-
pus, student-run "ghetto party" 
that was to be held Jan. 19, the 
day before the Martin Luther 
King Jr. holiday. 

On Jan. IS, an A&M residence 
life staff member received an 
anonymous letter announcing an 
annual off-campus "M.L. King 
Party." 

The letter alleged that partygo-
er would arrive in blackface, or 
dressed as stereotypes of blacks.

Sasse said all residence life 
staff will undergo mandatory sen-
sitivity training from the depart-
ment of multicultmal services. 
The training wi ll be available for 
students on a voluntary basis. 

"We work very hard to have 
inclusiveness," Sasse said. "These 
kinds of incidents don't help. 
We're going to use this as an 
opportunity to reach out to stu-
dents." 

Bryan Cassidy, an industrial 
distribution sophomore, attended 
the "ghetto party" last year. He 
said that Tht Battalion, A&M's 

staff of Walton 
Hall , an all-male, 
on-campus dor-
mitory with 350 
residents, were 
accused of orga-
nizing and par-
ticipating in the 
event, and a

The letter said the party was 

not to honor the civil rights 
leader, but to do "just the oppo-
site. " 

In response to the sca ndal, 
Ron asse, director of residence 
life, hand-delivered a letter to 
each Walton Iiall resident 
expressmg the department's out-
rage, and called upon them to 
come forward with information 
about the party. 

"Such incidents show a lack of 
respect for others, are destructive 
to the residence hall community 
and are a disgrace and embarrass-
ment to lCxas A&M University." 

asse wrote in the letter. 
hannon Ensom, resident 

director of Walton Hall , said she 
received an anonymous note that 
said, "We never intended to 
offend anyone. After talking with 
our African-American friends, we 
realize it could be interpreted as 
discriminatory by pcople who do 
not know our true feelings."

"People are JUSt taking this 

way too far," Cassidy said. "There 
\Vas one person dressed up as [a 
KlansmanJ, who was an African-
American , so it wasn't some 
raCially bad party." 

Cassidy said the party had 
been planned for the holiday to 
take advantage of the weekend 
and said there was never a ghettO 
theme. 

"It's JUSt another College 
Station party," Cassidy said. 
"Most people did not dress up, 
but I'm sure some people had 
some flln with it." 

Sarah Gatson, an assistant 
professor of sociology at A&M, 
said the choice to have a ghetto 
party coincide with the King hol-
iday reveals that most people are 
ignorant of the meaning of the 
word "ghetto." 

Ghetto, she said, comes from 
the description of the Jewish 
ghetto and the concept that if you 
physically separate a community 
it is easier to eradicate it. King 
fought such segregation.

Alumna's art displayed in PC Gallery 
Che brings light multiple-dimensional work to UCSD 

By DAN BROWN 
Staff Writer 

UCSD alumna and artist 
Ginger Che has had her work on 
display in the Price Center Gallery 
A and B since Jan. 16, and will 
remain there until Feb. 13 . 

An opening ceremony was held 
this past week on Jan. 17 from 7 
p.m . to II p.m. where spectators 
and art lovers gathered to esteem 
the works of Che, who earned her 
bachelor of arts degree with honors 
in visual arts from UCSD in 2002. 

Che allowed her personal auto-
biographical works to be displayed 
fo r the public's enjoyment. She is 
one of the many artists who have 
participated in Art Coordinator 
Sharmila Ray's art program, which, 
according to Ray, aims to "expose 
[the] students, faculty and public to 
art in its many different forms and 
styles." 

Che refrains from expressing 
herself in one definitive medium of 

artwork because she primarily views 
herself as a painter. The works of 
art on display in Price Center 
Gallery contain a varied assortment 
of pictures communicating the 
themes of multiculturalism, spiritu-
ality and female sexuality. 

To further augment the emo-
tions symbolized in the paintings on 
display, Che incorporates unusual 
materials into her works: Rice, 
shells, kel p, sand glass, matches, 
paint, beads, feathers, twigs and 
miniature models can all be found 
on the canvas. Che justifies her 
technique by saying that art should 
not be restrained to being station-
ary. 

"Light changes the work, repre-
senting the fact that nothing stands 
still," Che said. "Not even art." 

Behind the changing images of 
Che's work is the artist herself, 
who has gone through a fair 
amount of alterations in her life-
time as well. Born in Taipei, 
Taiwan, in 1970, Che moved to 

Germany at the age of eight with 
her mother and little brother. 
Spending the majority of her youth 
in Bremen, Germany, Che eventu-
ally moved 10 San Diego in 1992, 
where she later attended Mesa 
College to earn her associate of 
arts in fine arts . She then went on 
to attend UCSD. 

Drawing upon her dreams, 
meditations and memories of the 
past as sources of inspiration for 
her artwork, Che creates images 
that attempt to illustrate her per-
sonal feelings and philo ophies. 

"Che refuses to adapt to one 
sole category for her expression," 
Ray said of Che's different styles. 

The exhibit is open to the pub-
lic. Che's artwork will be up until 
Feb. 13, when a new exhibit will be 
presented. 

"We cordially invite you to view 
the works of Ginger Che, an alum-
ni of UCSD, and to suPPOrt the 
thriving UCSD art movement," 
Ray said.

spaces from'S' to 'B.'" 
The 116 spaces that were 

changed in Lot 208 represent a 
total net loss of student spaces since 
October 2002 in the campus park-
ing system. As of this year, there are 
6,905 "S" spaces on campus. 

According to the 
Transportation and Parking 
Services Office fall 2002 survey, 
about 990 "S" spaces go unused 
during the peak occupancy on 
average at 1 p.m. daily. 

According to a fall 2002 
overnight survey by the 
Transportation and Parking ervices 
Office on Lot 208, on-eampus Muir 
residents should have adequate 
parking spaces for their needs. The 
survey results show that about 150 
"S" parking spaces were avai lable 
between 2 a.m. and 6 a.m. 

"Based upon these numbers, we 
anticipate that Muir resident stu-
dents will be able to find sufficient 
parking in this lot in the evenings," 
said Director of Transportation 
and Parking Services Greg Snee. 
"However, due to the present con-
struction, commuting'S' permit 
holders will be displaced to other 
parking lots." 

But according to the survey, 
parking lots near Muir, uch as the 
Thurgood Marshall College lot, 

showed that US" spaces are already 
100 percent occupied during peak 
hours. Other constructions that 
affect student parking include 
three projects in the Earl Warren 
College area. Currently, Lot 503 
does not have sufficient student 
parking spaces in the evenings for 

" Based upon these num, 
bers I we anticipate that

will be able to firulsuffi, 
dent parking in this lot in 

the evenings. 'I

However, the campus is cur-

rently in its design phase for a third 
parking structure to be sited at the 
northwest corner of Hopkins 
Drive and Voight Lane. 
Construction is set to begin in 
summer 2003 and should create 
about 1, 140 parking spaces. 

Construction should be completed 
by fall 2004. A fourth parking 
structure is also in its plannmg 
stages, in a location that is yet to be 
decided. 

The NMR Imagin g Jnd

used for research in developing 
methods for NMR imaging of pep-
tides and protems, protem truc-

ies in structural genOlmcs.

By LISA MAK

Illes to commemorate our 10th 
aniliversary. "

graphed and complete with 
Vibrant costumes and traditional 
music, and there IS a wide range of 
s£yles to reflect the many cultures 
of the area . Otcworthy gems to

Australian regions. The music is

Something is rotten in the 
state of the film industry 

Films really aren't what they used to be, but 
people still pay to see them anyway 

don't pop 
my sheep 

Anne Cong-huyen 

SO it's the middle of awards ea-son. ormally, thiS would indicate that the film studios 
are pulling out all the stops and 
releasing those movies they've 
waited all year to release - the 
good films that will hopefully gain 
the studiOS an Oscar nomjnatlon 
and rrutke them lots of mula. That 
would normally mean that this is 
also the time of year when all 
everyone flocks to see are the 
mOVles that are getting "0 car 
buzz." But if this is so, then how 
come this pa t weekend, the three 
top-grossing movies (according to 
Exhibitor Relations, 0.) were 
"Kangaroo Jack" (SI7,675,000), 
"National Securi£y" ( $15,700,(00) 
and uJust Married" (SI2,450,000)? 

OK, 1 don't want to sound like a 
complete film snob, which I am 
sometimes - though I re peet a 
person's need to occasionally see a 
silly mOVIe that requires no brain 
cells - but thjs i just a load of 
bull ! If the top-grossing movie of 
the weekend were: two guys chas-
ing a lungaroo that hopped off 
with S I 00,000, a Martin Lawrence 
movie, and a romantic comedy 
about a frustrated and SOCia lly mi -
matched couple on their disastrous 
European honeymoon, then there 
must detin~elr b( something very 

wrong with either the American 
movie-going public or with the 
movie industry - or both. 

The first explanation must of 
cour e be that there's nothing good 
out, or why would anyone ever 
shell out $8 to see a movie that got 
an average viewer review of 2.7 
starS Out of 10 
(Imp:llww.imdb.com)? That would 
make the most scnse, and would 
not make moviegoers seem nearly 
as stupid as adverti ers think thc)' 
are. But with bushels of grlpplllg 
and touching films like "25th 
Hour," "The I lours," "Adaptation" 
or "About chmidt," why are peo-
ple seemg econd-rate comedle~ 
that leave you wanting to send 
death threats to the filmmakers' 

The big hudget movies get all 
the press. Right? That's why no 
one's seeing lhe smaller films, 
'cause no one's nevcr heard of 
them. But that isn't entirely true 
either. The only thing on thc 
tongues of a self-respecting CrlUC 
or a respectable Jlublication i how 
uperb Nicholas C"ge was in 

"Adaptation" or how breathtaking 
the choreography was III 
"Chicago." With all this press, 
though, why are so few people see-
ing the e brilliant film ? 

One major problem is that 
many of these films are indepen-
dent or art fi lms that can't afford 
Wide dlstribuuon or marketing. 
Because of this, many play in a 
nunute number of theaters. For 
in tance, a of thl weekend,

Such a trajedy: 'Darkness Falls' 
and it can't get up again 

Not-50-talented actors and a two-bit script leave movie-
goers wanting to stay out of the theater. 

By DAVID BYNUM 
Senior Staff Writer 

Everyone left the theatre a litde con-fused. "Darkness Falls" provided nei-ther an actor from "Dawson's Creek," 
nor a female lead with ridiculously large 
breasts. Standing in where James Van Der 
Beek should have been was Chaney KJey. [f 
you haven't heard from him, it is because he 
has never been in a film before, and he will 
more than likely never be in a fi lm again. 
The female lead is played by Emma 
Caulfield, who hails with bit parts from such 
series as "Beverly Hills: 90210" and "Nash 
Bridges." 

With this kind of star power, all a film 
needs is a scri pt revolving around a tooth 
fairy burn victim gone crazy. Luckily, 
"Darkness Falls" provides just dut. Besides 
being troubled by the number of logical 
Inconsistencies dlat seem to plague most 
modern horror film cripts, "Oarlmes Falls" 
also failed to provide any explanation as to 
how the haunted tooth fairy chose her vic-
tims. While she was supposed to plague the 
entire town of Darkness Falls, she spent the 
majori£y of the film chasing after just two of 
its citizens. 

0, there was no typO in dlC last line. 
"Darkness Falls" is not only the name of the 
film, but also the ci£y in which the film is set 
and a noun-verb combo that won't quit for 
anyone in this roller-coaster ride that never 
take off. 

Anyone who has een the trailer knows 
that the film's famously haunting whisper is 
"stay in dle light." Some slight variation of 
this phrase made up the majority of the film's 
dialogue. The phra e continues to haunt the 
viewer 3 S they leave the theatres only 
because they havc heard it 0 frequcndy dur-
IIlg the 84 mmutes of the movie. 

It really I>n 't eas\' to make a film tillS bad 
Olll: must con'lder' the fact that if the 111111-

REVIEW 

makers had done anything wor e, than it 
might have almo t been laughable, and had 
they done anything better, well, obviously 
the film would have benefited from that as 
well. 

The scariest thing about this film is that it 
ever got made, and even scarier perhaps is 
that it made it to wide theatre release. Even 
if this film had a redeeming message, it still 
would not be good enough to show a an 
after school special . Please do not see this 
film; doing 0 wOllld only encourage 5nldios 
to release others likc it.

The country tinged Mother Hips is a 
band definitely worth listening to 
The band may have garnered critical acclaim with 
"Green Hills of Earth" but they are breaking up 

By BILLY GIL 
Staff Writer 

Given the indie credibility of The Mother I lips, yOIl had bellcr get on board qUi ckly; aftcr all, there is an 
IInpending breakup III the band's nC.lr 
future . In the mcantime, sit back and take 
a moment to familiarize your self with 
"Left Oast rock 'n ' roll. " 

Jf you like Wileo's new album and you 
want to hear more country-tingcd folk 
that's not afr,lId to rock out or take 
chances, try The Mother Illps, a Chlco-
based outfit led by singer-songwriters Tim 
Bluhm and Greg Loiacono. Just don 't c.ll1 
them wannabces. 

"The two bands arc peers," Bluhm said 
in response to such a cOlllpari on. "Pcer~ 
arc not as influential as elders." 

The influences In question include the 
Beach Boys, the Byrds and Buffalo 
SpringfIeld. The result is J playful mix of 
Bcatfes-esque harmonies laid over a back-
drop of twangy gUltar~ and broken-heart 
lyrics. It's nothing completely onginal, just 
some of the finest pop music around today. 

Though mostly a well -kept secret, the 
band has gotten 1110re press in the last cou-
ple of years due to the critical success of 
their most recent album, 2001 's "Green 
I [ills of Earth." The album is a dynamic 
piece of CaliforllIa pop-ruck, vucillating 
bClween light acollstic gUitars and softly 
sung mclodies and a hcavier rock sOllnd .

Why persist in a 
necessary evil long 

after the necessity has 
ceased to exist? 

Why teach medical 
student to be 

merciless? 
Why discourage 

compassion? Why perpetuate a 
cycle of breeding-
caging-killing? 

Why extinguish 
empathy? 

Why kill dogs in first year 
pharntacology and physiology at 

UCSD School of Medicine? 
Lethal vivisection of purpose-bred dogs is not necessary to teach pharmacology or 
physiology These labs persist despite the fact that 95% of US medical schools kill 

no animals, let alone dogs, in pharmacology. And 82% kill no animals, let alone dogs, 
in physiology. They persist despite opposition from hundreds of San Diego physicians 
who signed a petition urging that they cease. They persist despite th fact that they 

are not neces ary for research or urgery practice. They persist d spite animal use 
guidelines urging replacement of lethal labs when alt rnatives are available . They 
persist b cau e th UCSD Animal Subj ct Committee conclud that I thai dog 

vivi ection lab involve "no animal welfare i ue ." Doctor again t dog lab urge all 
MSI who feel inclined toward campa ion and mercy to opt out of thes upcoming 
lab before the Feb. 1 Deadline. We also urge th UCSD Community to conta t th 
Animal Subjects Committee at iacuc@ucsd.edu and express oppo ition to continued 

dog labs. You can learn more about physician opposition to UCSD Dog Labs by

continued from page 10 

aters, while "Kangaroo Jack" was 
playing in 2,8 18 (for shame!). This 
is a travesty. But if one looks at the 
gross profits for the weekend , 
"Chicago" came in sixth, making 
about $8 million. "Chicago" played 
in one-fifth the theaters 
"Kangaroo Jack" did, but making a 
little more than half that definitely 
ain't bad. 

So not everyone our there is an 
impressionable, brainless twit who 
watches whichever movie has the 
coolest trailers - which most 
often means the ones with the big 
explosions and girls wearing really 
small articles of clothing. And I 
musm't leave out the formulaic 
romantic comedies that are 
churned out on a monthly basis. 
Some people will actua lly take the 
effort to see films that have some 
degree of value and aren't just 
brain-numbing tra h. Now, I admit 
that sometimes I like nothing bet-
ter than to plop down on my plaid 
couch and watch "Never Been 
Kissed" or "The Fast and the 
Furious." Every working college 
student under tands that there are 
massive amounts of stress in our 
daily lives, and it's nice to JUSt veg 
out in front of a nashing screen 
with pretty people so that we don 't 
have to think. It's nice to have a 
break every once in a while. 

But my entire entertainment 
diet does not con ist of movies that 
make up for plot and character 
development with right asses and 
big fires. No SIr. That would be 
like a person who survlVcd entirely 
off of chocolate or bonbons. It 's 
much more healthy to shake It lip a 
bit with some documcntanes. some 
dramas (good ones. mind you) , 
some musicals and, of course, orne 
classics. Such a movie diet would 
leave me a much more well -round-
ed and, hopefully, interesting per-
son. 

It 's much more impressive (trust 
me, ) know) when you tell some-
one that you just saw the new Spikc 
Jonze ("Adaptation") or Paul 
Thomas Anderson ("Punch Drunk 
Love'') movie. YOII can say that 
with pride rather than sheepishly 
saying, U) saw 'A Guy Thing' this 
weekend .. . Don't see it." Because

PREVIEW 

UCSD baseball must step up to the plate 
By COURTNEY FIELD 

Staff Writer 

The fifth-place finish for the 
2002 Triton baseball team put 
uc 0 baseball back on the com-
petitive map. Finishing just one 
game shy of getting a playoff berth, 
the Tritons vastly improved from 
the 2001 season, where they finished 
in last place. The 2003 team brings 
new challenges and a new group of 
talented players to the field. 

Nine players graduated last 
year, vacating four starting infield 
po itions and five pitching spots. 
The Houston Astros organiz.ation 
drafted third baseman Ryan Larson 
after he graduated last year, and the 
Tampa Bay Devil Rays picked up 
Triton pitching ace John Beaven, 
who also graduated in 2002. 

With many crucial spots to fill, 
UCSD will face new challenges in 
the very competitive California 
Collegiate Athletic Association. 

"This will be a very exciting 
season for us," said Triton head 
coach Dan O'Bnen. "With so 
many veterans graduating, the guys 
who were not in the limelight last 
year will be this year. They will be 
the role models; it is their time to 
step up and shine." 

The Triton pitching staff 
returns with three solid hurlers 
from last year's team. Joining them 
is a strong group of freshman 
recruits who, with the talent and 
experience of the returning players, 
will be a formidable force on the 
mound . 

While UCSD pushes to 
improve every day, the rest of the 
competition In the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association is

positions that were left vacant Vacancies indude five pitchers and all four infielders. 

also improving and striving to 
reach higher goals. 

"Every year the conference gets 
tougher," O'Brien said. "You get 
more teams competing at a higher 
level trying to prove that they 
deserve to be at the top. If you do 
not work as hard as the other 
teams, one of them will step up and 
surpass you." 

That is why the Tritons have 
been training so vigorously this 
off-season. UCSD knows that the 
other teallls in the conference are 
working just as hard, if not harder 
than they are due to the outstand-
ing play of last year's Triton base-
ball team. 

"Because we became a playoff 
threat last year, the other teams in 
our conference know that they will 
have to improve in order to com-
pete with our program now," 
O'Brien said. 

The 2003 UCSD baseball sea-
son will be an exciting one to watch 
and follow, with strength sprouting 
from the seasoned returners and 
the fresh roolcies. 

UCSD kicks off its pre-season 
schedule with a double header 
against Vanguard University at 
Triton Baseball Stadiul11 on Feb. I 
at II a.l11 . Conference play begins at 
2 p.m. on Feb. I3 against Cal Poly 
Pomona at Triton Baseball Stadium. 

Young Triton softball team ready to play 
By JOE SPANO 

Staff Writer 

With the 2003 softball season 
starting on Feb. I, the UC D soft -
ball team is hoping to build upon 
the success it had in last year's sea-
son and come away with a confer-
ence championship - or more -
this season. The team is very young 
with only four upperclassmen, but it 
has a lot of talent regardless of age, 
and the Tritons are ready to take on 
the California Collegiate Athletic 
Association Western Conference. 

"We have a lot of new faces this 
year, and as a result, it's talOng us a 
little longer to play together this 
year, but right now we're working 
on our team chemistry, and things 
are coming together smoothly," 
said junior Kim Aggabao, who 
plays hortStop and econd base. 

Last year. the Tritons tied for sec-

ond place with CSU Dominguez 
Hills in the CCAA West Division, 
posting CCAA records of 20-12, 
while UC Davis took first with a 
record of 24-8. one of these teams 
ended up with the real prize, the 
championship of the Western 
region, which Chico State took after 
barely reaching the .500 mark, fin-
ishing 16-16 in CCM play. 

"We have some big competition 
in our conference," Aggabao said. 
"Davis is always a good game, and 
we want to beat Chico this year." 

Perhaps the Tritons' greatest 
challenge this year will be making up 
for the loss of their two staJ1:ing 
pitchers from last year, of which only 
one spot has been fiUed so far. 

The team is not without any 
returning star veterans, though. 
Back for another season IS offen ive 
powerhouse Amy Mettee, a junior 
who led the team in batting average 

(.394), slugging percentage (.621), 
on-base percentage (.421 ), hits 
(78), runs (46), doubles (18), rriplcs 
(6) and home runs (5). 

Aggabao 31 0 provided a lot of 
sparks with the bat last year, fintsh -
ing second to Mettee in many cate-
gories, such as on-base percentage 
(.378) and runs scored (3 1), while 
also leading the team in walks (12) 
and sacrifice bunts (24) . 

"Young players are not an 
excuse; we have the talent and 
know what it takes to win," 
Aggabao said. "We have some great 
veterans leading the team, and our 
goal is to win conference." 

The season starts with the Best of 
the West Invitational talcing place in 
Turlock, Calif. After that, the 
Tritons head to San Francisco, 
Calif., to take on San Francisco State 
University on Feb. 7, followed by 
Sonoma State University on Feb. 8.

Track plans to run over competition Women's water polo looks 
to continue success in 2003 By MICHAEL SCHOECK Staff Writer 

The UCSD men's and 
women's track and field teams 
plan to race to victory in the 2003 
season and leave many challeng-
ing competitors in the dust, the 
way the program has done in the 
past few years of steady yet stag-
gering improvement. 

Both teams were strengthened 
by a successful recruiting drive 
that revitalized the 21 events that 
compose the UCSD track teams, 
and with relatively few losses to 
graduation, the season prospects 
look very bright. 

"[Although) distance is histori-
cally strong, we are well-balanced 
with all of our events," said Triton 
head coach Tony Salerno. 

The women's team is particular-
ly well-balanced and is intent upon 
nipping at the heels of "prohibitive 
favorite" UC Davis. 

Senior ational Collegiate 
Athletic Association All-Anlerican 
distance runner Audrey Sung 
lead a Triton team that stunned 
the California Collegiate Athletic 
Association with a strong second 
place fini sh in the 2002 champi-
onships . 

"We went from fifth place to 
second place last year, and we 
Inlend to win in 2004," sa id 
alerno of the progre s the team is 

makmg. 
Formidable UCSD throwers, 

slich JS 'CAA All-Americans 
se il lor Sara Allsup and junior 

agrario Il ernandez, who wield 
the disclls and shotput, respective-
ly. hope to expand their 31rc3dy 
admirable record with four 

All-Americans produccd from the 
squad last year. 

Sophomore Meredith Perry, 
the 2002 CCAA 100-meter hurdl e 
champion, fronts a strong group 
of hl.rdlers with exciting possibili-
ties in the near future . 

Jackie Vu, a senior, is the top 
returning pole vaulter in the 
conference, and is after an 
improvement on her third -place 
fi nish in the 2002 CCM 
Championships. 

The 400-meter relay team 
wants to further smash the school 
record, which was already shat-
tered in 2002. Returning from that 
record-brealcing squad are junior 
sprinter Liz Tsu and junior inter-
mediate hurdler Hilary Mills. 
They are accompanied by new-
comers Sandy Schaefer and 
Courtney Aberegg, who will likely 
be the third and fourth legs of the 
relay. 

The high jump looks to be one 
of the team's strongest events, 
with four women expected to fin-
ish among the top of the CCAA in 
jumps. 

Senior Zita Dixon leads a team 
of talented fresrunen high jumpers 
that include Kendra Canape, Erica 
Malouf and Kate Bankiewicz.

are also returning CCAA scorers 
from last years squad. 

The mens track and field team 
is also looking to improve on its 
fifth-place finish in the CCAA 
Championship Meet in 2002 with 
this season's squad. 

"We were in fifth place last 
year, but this year we're aiming for 
third place," Salerno said. 

Senior captains Trevor 
Takayama and Sam Denes will 
lead a talented group of sprinting 
sensations that includes freshmen 
Peiman Lahsaei and Matt Horner, 
both of whom compete in the 100 
and 200 sprints. 

The throws, led by junior Abel 
Aramburo on the javelin and dis-
cus, as well as sophomore Ozzie 
Murray, have promise in assisting 
in culling strong scores for the 
Tritons. 

The hurdlers, pole vaulters and 
jumpers are also progressing, with 
senior pole vaulter and long jumper 
David Long and sophomore Chris 
Tsang in the 110 hurdles. 

Senior distance runner David 
Dunbar and junior distance runners 
Mike Daly and eil Kalra, in the 
800 and 5,000 meter races, respec-
tively, are looking to be tandouts 
on a well-developed squad. 

"We are very fortunate to have 
the commionent of uch talented 
- academically and athletically-
student athletes who give their 
best," said UCSD assistant coach 
Tetl Van Andale. 

The first meet of the upcoming 
season will be the UC D Blue-

old Alumni Meet at 10 a.m. on 
Feb. 8. Then the Tmon Will par-
tiCipate in the Pomona-Pitzer A11-

omer meet on Feb_ 15.

Coming off a season where 
women's water polo went 20-13, 
the team h.s high expectations for 
2003, but that is nothing new. 

"Our goal each year is to win our 
conference and go to the Final Four 
in womens water polo," said UCSD 
head coach Larry Sanders. 

Last years team was very talent-
ed, and although the Tritons lost two 
of their leading scorers from last year 
in Emma Kudritzki (62 goals) and 
Courmey Hemmerly (3 1 goals), as 
well as goalie Stephanie Lombardo 
due to an injury, the Tritons boast a 
talented group of newcomers. 

"We have a great group of 
incoming freshman and junior col-
lege transfers," Sanders said. "We 
have a very talented freshman in 
Kaiclin Foe and returning backup 
goalie Andrea Corn ford to help 
anchor the defense to go along with 
the core of the team returning; we 
should be a very capable team." 

Success this year will not come 
from a few individual stars, but a 
total tea m effort. 

" f think this year will be all 
about the team," Sanders said. 
"They all have roles to play and 
know what the expectations are for 
each one of them." 

Going up against ollle of the 
best competioon in the nation, 
UCSD has a tough schedule. ome 
games that stand out are the tough 
home games against the nivcrsity

what matters most to the Tritons is 
winning their conference games. 

"Of course our conference 
games are very important," Sanders 
said. "They affect the end of the 
yea r seeding for our conference 
championships. " 

The Tritons begin the season on 
Feb. 2 at the UniverSity of Redlands, 
with the first home game on Feb. 7 
against the UniverSity of Michigan . 
While the national champiomhlp 
are not until May, the Tmons expect

meaningful , considering UCSD IS

Nationals are the goal of 
UCSD men's tenrus team 

By ANU KUMAR 
Sports Editor 

Dunng ItS prevIOus twO sea-
~()m , UCSD men 's tennis failed to 
advance past the regional round 
of the playoffs, but while Tnton 
head coach Enc teldlmaycr and 
hi!. tcam prepare for their 2003 
~eason, which begms on Feb. I, 
UC D hopes that It can reach the 
national level of the posL~ea50n . 

In 2002, the Tntons started 
the sea~on 5-0 before finislung 
10-10. The final dlsappomtmem 
was a 6-1 loss to Bngham Young 
Ulllversity-Hawail m the second 
round West RegIOn playoffs. 

"A11 we want to do thiS year IS 
get past that level and reach the 
nationals," Steidl mayer said. 

T he Tritons have an experi-
enced team this year, with all six 
starting singles players rerurning 
this season from last year's squad. 

Steidl mayer will look for Sameer 
Chopra, last year's o. 1 singles 
player, and captain Mike Meyer, 
to do well for the team. 

"He's had a very good couple 
of years," Steidl mayer said of 
Meyer. "He's our leader. Mike's a 
big' guy, and he's had the most 
succe~s over anyone here."

but he sees an upside for them. 

"All of them will play in the

By CHRISTINE UM 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD women's tennis 
team looks forward to another 
winnmg season after a fantastic 
finish last year, when it ended 
the rel,ru lar sea on With a record 
of 18-2 and earned a high rank-
Ing in postseason games. The 
Tntons will host their first game 
agamst CSU an Bernardino on 
Feb. I. 

In 2002, the team was 23-4, 
Includmg postseason play. On 
March 26 against San Jo e tate 
UlllveTSlty, the Tntons played 
well , but lost by one se t . Then, 
dunng the Xenia Anasta iadou 
Memorial Tournament in 
Pomona, Calif., the team won 
two out of three games and 
placed third against six other 
Division II schools. 

Against California Collegiate 
Athletic Association team, the 
Tritons were perfect: eight wins 
and no losses. Three games were 
won at home and five away, earn-
ing a first-place standing against 
eight other CCAA teams. On 
April 21, after advancmg to the 

AA hampionship game in 
SconsdaJe, Ariz., the No. I-seed -
ed UCSD team won second

O'Neil and Stephanie Moriarty, 
who are currently studying 
abroad. With seven freshmen , the 
Triton are a relatively young 
team this season. 

However, Jul ie Westerman, 
one o f the team's co-captains, 
feels confident with the new si n-
gles and doubles teams. 

" I think [the new players)

adjust and help us with a good 
season." 

Head coach Liz LaPlante 
looks forward to the first few 
games of the season . 

"We're hoping to get [the) 
freshmen experience," LaPlante 
said . "We have serious tennis

Feb. 20 when the Tritons face 
CCAA rIVals Cal Poly Pomona at 
Pomona, and on Feb. 22, when 
the team hosts Grand Canyon

Full speed 
ahead for 

women's crew 
By CHRISTINE LIM 

Staff Writer 

At 4:30 in the morning, the 
average person, if woken, would be 
barely functioning. That same per-
son would probably consider wak-
ing up at such an hour insane. Now 
imagine not one, but a team of 
women voluntarily rising at that 
time, getting into boats and prac-
ticing their rowing technique. It 
might not be fun all the time, but 
wlllning is the No. I priority for 
UCSD women's crew. In return for 
hard work, comminnent and deter-
mination, the Tritons have high 
hopes for a successful season . 

The Tritons began the year on 
Oct. 27 when UCSD hosted the 
first annual Row for the Cu re at 
Mis ion Bay. They next participat-
ed in the ewport Au tu111 n 
Rowing Festival on Nov. 3. n 

ov. 10, the Tritons went to 
Washington for the Ilead of the 
Lake competition. 

U SD head coach P.HtI 
Pinkerton IS confident about the 
team 's upcoming !.eawn. Thl! 
lightweight \'ar!olty tC;llll ha con-
Sl tenuy been rankeu one of the 
tOP 10 teams 111 the n3t10n. ThiS I, 
also a very good year for the v.l rsi-
ty team because it is the firs t year 
under Pinkerton's coaching that 
the team ha had Juniors and 
semors who have perfectcd thclr 
kills. 

"From all of the teStlllg results, 
[this yea r 's grou p) seems to be the 
strongest in [UC D 's) history," 
Pinkerton said. "[We row) plan-
ning as if qualifying for the nation-
al championshi ps." 

Crew also has a strong group of 
novices. Five of the 10 records kept 
by the women 's team were 
achieved by this year's novice team. 

ovice freshman Dannan 
Hodge says the team is exci teu 
about the rest of the sea on. 

" We have a really well -rounued 
team," Hodge said . "We're all 
diver e, but compliment each other 
well. The coache ' make sure we 
work hard, but also enJoy it." 

The next rega tta will take place 
at 1ission Bay o n M arch 2 JgJlllSt 
UC Irvllle. ThJS race, and the next 
on March 8 against Long Beach 
State University, will be challeng-
ing for the Tritons. Performing 
well at the San Diego Crew Classi 
on April 5 and April 6 will be 
important for the team to earn a 
higher national ranking. T he an 
Diego City hampion hips on 
April 19 will also be an lllteresllng 
regatta again t cross- town n vals 
SDSU and USD. 

"UC Irvine, Long Beach, USD 
and SDSU are our traditional 
riva ls," Pinke rton said. 

In the post season, there arc 
three important events. The first is 
the Western Intercollegiate Rowing 
Association Championships held 
May 3 and May 4. 

"It is important, but nor key, to 
do well at this race; however, it is 
more important to do well at the 
following races," Pinkerton saiu .

Pacific Coast ROW ing
