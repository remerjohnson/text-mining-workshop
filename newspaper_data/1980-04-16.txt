AS Elections Board 
Hears Complaints 

BY JENIFER WARREN 
Staff Write. 

1be four-person AS Elections Board 
heard this year's first two complaints 
on campaign conduct lasl night. 

One, concerning a posting violation, 
resulted in a censure for the offenders. 
The second, ' regarding conlent of a 
flier, wu dismissed unanimously by 
the Board after a brief perfunctory 
discussion. 

The first complaint the Elections 
Board dealt wilh last night, filed by the 
"Student Interests Not Special 
Interests" slate, headed by Linda 
Sabo, concerned illegal posting of Riers 
by another slate on a Revelle campus 
bulletin board. 

''The 'College Priority' slate violated 
the Election Codes br, posting their 
fliers over our posters, , charged vice-

~idential candidate Bill T opkis. 
Not only did their action negate the 

effectiveness of our posters, but it cost 
us valuable campaigning time." 

Jan Brenslauer, representing the 
"College Priority" slate, acknowledged 
the char"e, but no~ed, "it was just one 

of our clones working at Revelle lut 
night" who was responsible. 

"We really made a mistake and I'm 
sorry," said Brenslauer, adding that 
the slate plans to "use fewer people on 

. the caJ)lpaign and make sure this 
doesn't happen again." 

T opkis urged the fJections Board to . 
"visit each college and see how 
frequently this violation is occuring" 
and requested that the offenders be 
penalized for an act which "wu a real 
slap in the face to our entire slate." 

A ''brief tour of the campus last 
night" by Elections Commissioner 
Bruce Napell and Board members 
Dana White, Charles Greenfield and 
Denise Whitley revealed "two or three 
illegal postings at Third and a few more 
at Muir," said Napel!. 

"We decided to issue a censure to 
the "College Priority" slate," said 
Napell, which is defined in the fJection 
Codes as "An official notice ordering

Students, Senior Citizens 
Combine at Anti-9 Rally 

BY CAROLYN FRIDAY 
Sacramento Corre.pondent 

While Howard Jarvis was launching 
his campaign for Proposition 9 at a 
$125 a plate Tax Day lunch in the 
Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Los Angeles 
yesterday, college students and senior 
citizens began a vocal attack against 
the initiative from the steps of the 
capitol building. 

Students Together Opposing Prop. 
9 (STOP 9), a statewide "po~tical 
action coalition" of student advocates, 
the Grey Panthers and the Congress of 
California Seniors, bridged the 
generation gap to organize a rally 
against the tax-slashing initiative that 
will be decided at the polls June 3. 

"We are students and seniors 
together opposing Prop. 9. We can 
and will work together to defeat it since 
we understand what we have to lose if 
Prop. 9 passes," STOP 9 coordinator 
Vincent Harris told a crowd of 
approximately 200 students and 

journalists. 
As the seniors were busy hawking 

bright yellow t-shirts showing a big fish 
eating a smaller fish that said" Jarvis is 
not the answer," students from 
Sacramento area community and state 
colleges and UC Davis sold STOP 9 
campaign buttons. 

Even a busload of elementary 
students showed up for the activity. 
One of these youngsters prophetically 
paraded a silf that said, "Keep lJC 
Tuition Free.' 

The loudest cheer went up when 
Harris announced the results of the

Iranian Students Hope 
Money Gets Through 

Closing of Consulates Threatens Flow 
BY DAIL ST .CLAIRE BACON 

Staff Writer 
This is the first of two articles on the 

effect of sanctions on Iranian students. 
The second will concern Iranian 
students' reactions. 

The closing of the Iranian Embassy 
leaves Iranian students uncertain 
about their financial situation, said 
Phylis Clark, UCSD Dean of 
International Education. 

Clark sent a letter to Iranian students 
last week advising them not to leave 
the country and to arrange for a 
transfer of funds directly with their 
ministry or bank in Iran instead of 
going through their consulate. 

Students originally obtained money 
from Iran through Iranian consulates 
which closed along with the Embassy. 
Under Iranian law, students must 
submit a document to their consulate 
from the school they're attending 
certifying they're a fuJI time student. 

After verifying the document, the 
consulate would forward it to the 
appropriate bank who releases funds 
previously set up by the student's 
~arenta or benefactors. Clark is 
'hopeful" that the verification from the 
International Education Office will 
prove acceptable in this interim period~ .

The appointmenta delighted Cheryl 
Dunnett, who served on the 
chancellor'. search committee. 

Dunnett faced Atkinson down during 
hia recent campus vWt, inaistint( during 

Clark admitted that she had no idea 
if the banks would honor the document. 
It's the only thing to do under the 
circumstances, she said adding, "We 
just have to wait until the situation 
clarifies itself." 

"Iranian students are like pawns (in 
this political situation) just as the 
hostages are like pawns," Clark 
commented. "The students aren't to 
blame for this situation, yet they bear 
the brunt of the burden. Their 
government doesn't care what happens 
to them," she said. 

"I'm saddened to see these students 
under such pressure," Clark added, 
saying the ~ychological pressure wu 
"large". "The students are in a Catch-
22 situation. If they don't keep their 
student status, they stand a chance of 
being deported. Yet if they don't have 
money to pay their fees, they can't 
maintain their student stalua." 

There are 58 Iranian students at 
UCSD. 

U.S. Immigration and Naturaliza-
tion officials said the only way students 
could receive money from Iran wu if 
their government changed their

Issue Of The 80s: Surviving Political, Economic Troubles 
Wtth the country in a tax-cutting mood, 

the welfare state in di.repute and the

The lOcial problem. which launched

the dwindling number of elected Black

Entering the new decade, one out of 
every five blacks looking for work can't 
find a job, and almost half of all youths 
15·25 no longer even try. Average Black 
income, which had risen to '61 percent 01 
white income in the early 70s, has sunk 
below the levels of the early 60s; now 
Black. nationally make less than 58 
percent of what Whites earn. With a 
concerted attack on affirmative action 
underway and with schools more 
segregated now than they were in the 
Sixties, many of the civil rights gains of 
the last twenty years are gone-with the 
important exception of voting rights.

Begin Suggests Talks 
.Be Held Round Clock 
WASHINGTON - laraeli 
Prime Mini.ter Menachem 
Begin propo.ed to President 
Carter yesterday that six 
weeks of non· stop negotiations 
be held in the Middle East to 
try to reach an agreement on 
the future of Arab Palesti· 
nians; diplomatic sources said. 

The talk. would be held by 
the Israeli and Egyptian 
negotiating teams that in 10 
months have been unable to 
resolve any of the key issues 
involved In formulating an 
autonomy plan for 1.2 million 
Palestinians now living under 
Israeli control. 

Begin suggested sessions be 
held every day from now until 
the May 26 target date for a 
settlement. The sources, who 
asked not to be identified, said 
the prime minister proposed 
that half the meetings be held 
in Egypt and half in Israel. 

Carter informed the prime 
mini.ter that he would sound 
out Egyptian President Anwar 
Sadat for his views, the 
sources said. 

The Egyptians are believed 
to favor shifting the 
negotiations here toward the 
end of the month, relocating 
the teams headed by Egyptian 

Prime Minister Mu.tapha 
Khal~ and Israeli Interior 
Minister Josef Burg. 

But Begin took the position 
that moving the talks out of the 
region would pose technical 
difficulties. For one thing, any 
major moves would require 
approval by the Israeli 
Cabinet, which meets in 
Jerusalem. 

Begin reaffirmed in his first 
session with Carter that he 
would like to have the 
negotiations intensified and 
accelerated, the sources said. 

At the same time , he 
insisted that any autonomy 
plan be based scrupulously on 
the Camp David agreement of 
September 1978. 

Begin contends that pact 
calls for crealion of an 
administrative council. Sadal 
is insisting on a council with 
legislative and executive 
powers. 

The president greeted Begin 
on a porch outside the Oval 
Office yesterday morning , 
when they held the lirst of three 
scheduled discussions on the 
issue of Palestinian autonomy. 
Their task: to jog the slow. 
moving Egyptian . 1 sraeli 
negotiations.

Warrant Needed 
To Enter, Arrest 
WASHINGTON - The 
Supreme Court told police 
officers nationwide yesterday 
they cannot enter a person's 
home to make an arrest 
without warrant unless it's an 
emergency. 

By a 6·3 vote, the justices 
ruled thal both th e 
Constitution and the ancient 
belief that "a man's house is 
his castle" require such an 
imposition on police. 

The court previously had 
ru ed that most often police 
must have a court warrant 
before searching a home, but 
never before had the justices 
extended the warrant 
requirement to arrests. 

Existentialist 
Sartre Dies 
PARIS - Jean·Paul Sartre, 
whose existential view of man 
as the maker of his destiny 
placed him among the giants 
of modern philosophy, died 
yesterday after a month·long 
illness. 

The 74.year-old French 
writer-philo.opher died at 
Broussais Ho.pital in Paris, 
surrounded by a few dose 
friends, said one of those 
present, Liliane Siegel, author 
of a book on his life. . 

Others at the death bed. 
according to Ms. Siegel were 
feminist aulhor and playwright 
Simone de Beauvoir, Sartre's 
close companion for most of 
his life, and his adopted 
daul{hter, Arlette eI Kaim. 
The iconoclastic Sartre was 
awarded the Nobel Prize for 
Literature in 1964 , bulrefused 
to accept the prestigious prize 
to mark his contempt for what 
he called bourgeois honors. 

Brown's Name 
Stays on Ballot 
SACRAMENTO - A 
Sacramento judge refused 
yesterday lo remove Gov. 
Edmund Brown Jr.'s name 
from California 's June 3 
presidential primary ballot. 

Brown had asked the court 
in a writ filed earlier in the day 
to take his name off the 
Democratic primary ballot on 
grounda that it would confuse 

voters to see hi. name listed 
after he had withdrawn from 
the race. 

Steel Union Gets 
Fat Settlement 
PITTSBURG - The United 
Steelworkers today ratified a 
new three·year contract with 
the nation's nine largest .teel 
companies that add. 60 cents 
an hour plus hefty cost·of· 
living adju.tments to the 
average steelworker's salary. 

California Can't 
Sell Its Bonds 
SACRAMENTO - The 
State of California held a bond 
sale yesterday but no buyers 
came. 

State Treasurer Jesse 
Unruh blamed the state's 7 
percent interest limit and said 
he will ask the Legislature to 
raise it. 

Although two rating 
agencies recently downgraded 
California bondi, Unruh said 
the lack of bids "was no 
reflection on the quality of the 
state's bonds ."

Bulletin 
Student Rec Facilities 

Referendum 

STUDENT RECREA-
TION FACILITIES RE-

FERENDUM 
In April, 1980, under-

graduate and graduate 
students at UCSD will be 
asked to vote on a student 
referendum to construct, 
maintain, and operate new 
student recreation facili-
ties. 

The question will appear 
on the ballot as follows: 

"Shall the Students of 
the University of Califor-
nia at San Diego assess 
themselves a fee of $6.50 
per quarter per student for 
a period of up to 25 years 
for the sole purpose of 
constructing, maintaining, 
and operating Student 
Recreation Facilities 
consisting of a swimming 
po<>l, jacuzzi, five racquet-
ball/handball courts, and a 
shower/locker room 
located just north of the 
Warren West Field, a 
jacuzzi at the Natatorium, 
and night lighting on the 
Muir Field, said Facilities 
to be governed by the 
Student Recreation 
Facilities Charted" 

It is estimated that the 
proposed facilities will cost 
$1,219,000 and will be 
paid for with an 11.5% 
Regents Loan. Based on an 
enrollment of 10,000 
students, the $6.50 fee will 
generate $195,000 annual~ 
ly, of which $150,000 will 
cover the payback of the 
loan, leaving $45,000 for 
annual maintenance and 
utility costs. 

The loan will be 'fully 
paid in 25 years; at the end 
of the 25~year payback 
period, there will be a 
direct all-student vote to 
approve a new fee level for 
continued maintenance 
and operation. 

This referendum ques-
tion has been initiated, 
planned, and proposed by 
students working for 
student interests, with full 
professional and technical 
support. 
* The quarterly assess-
ment will not begin until 
completion of construc-
tion/ occupancy of these 
facilities. Students will pay 
for the facilities available 
for use. 

The construction will be 
completed with no trees 
eliminated. Solar heating 
and natural ventilation will 
reduce maintenance costs 
and external energy 
dependence. 

Students on financial 
aids will not be personally 
assessed this fee inasmuch 
as the financial aids package 
includes all required fees. 

There will be no 
additional user fees to 
registered students. 

Governance of these 
s tudent recre a tional 
facilities will reside in a 
body composed of voting 
student members, aug~ 
mented by non~voting 
consultants. 

The Department of 
Physical Education has 
guaranteed that a portion 
of faculty/ staff user fees at 
least equal to the student 
assessment of $6.50 per 
quarter per user will be 
released by the P.E. Dept. 
to the student governing 
board. 

The increase in the 
assessment over last 
spring's referendum is due 
sole ly to increased 
construction costs and a 
higher interest rate on the 
loan. 

The referendum requires 
a 213 majority vote to be 
enacted. Voter turnout 
must be at least 25% of the 
student population. 

The ASUCSD Bulletin is 
an advertisement paid for by 
the ASU CSD to give 
students an opportunity to 
exchange informatio n about 
meetings, events, and issues 
that concern the campus,

Therapy Offered to 
Students With Parents 
Who Are Separating 

BY ALICE ROCKEY 
Staff Wriler 

The Counleling and Psychological Servicel Center il 
implementing a new program at UCSD called The Sons and 
Daughters of Separating Or Divorced Parents. 

A t~apr group for sons and daughters of divorced 
paren!&, It Will met;t once a week throughout the trimester and 
II designed to assist students experiencing the separation or 
divorce of their parents. 

The brain·child of Miriam Levens, a clinical social 
worker/staff member ~nd Mark Minson, a graduate intern, 
the pro~am was conceived t? hel~ t~ose.ltudents undergoing 
the emol1onal and psycholOgical difficulties that accompanies 
parental separation/divorce. "It can be very lonely when your 
parents split up," says Levens. 

Minson and Levens will be the "facilitators" at the weekly 
grouJ;> meetings and will stress the support aspect of these 
meehngs. 

The exploration and focus of each session will be 
influenced by the participants' personal experience and it will 
include identifying the feelings of "helplessness" and 
"confusion" that children often feel when their parents 
divorce, according to Levenl. 

"Often the impact is very far reaching," noted Minson. "It 
affec.ts ~ork ~ schO?I perfonnance, interpersonal 
relabonshlps, sleepmg, eatmg, and dreaming patterns and 
individual self·esteem." The group will help individuals 
participating to "feel connected with hil or her peers" said 
Minson. 

,,\11 persons who are interest~ in signing up for the weekly 
session can contact the Counselmg & Psychological Services 
Center and leave their name and telephone number. 

The next session will be April 21 at 2 pm in 412 Warren

Third Wants to Boost Top 
Students' Education 
The Third College has just developed a 

resource program lor "high achieving" students 
which provides infonnation on internships: 
scholarships and honors programs. 

Michael Kane, a former UCSD 
undergraduate and graduate student has been 
?amed head of this program, which he says, is 
Intended to get ltudents involved in their field of 
study as well al recognizing students who have 
proved themselves to be "hard workers and high 
achievers." 

The program, which began this quarter, will 
work mostly with upper division students, since 
most academic programs are open only to them, 
Provost Joseph Watson said. 

The program is related indirectly to

these Codes." 
The FJection Board had far lesl trouble 

dismilsing a second complaint last night, which 
concerned the content of student welfare 
candidate Bob Spielmann'l flier. 

Presidential candidate Barry Hyman and the 
"Progressive Coalition" charged that 
SpielmaM's statement - "For years students 
were promised an effective student advocate 
program ... We don', have one yet" - misleads 
students into believing that no such program 
now exists on campus. (This program deals 
with problems su~h ,as abuse of students' rights, 
grade djaput'es, and sexual harallsment.) 

"We have a very successful student 
advocate program now," said Jon Bekken, this 
year's AS Student Welfare Commissioner, 
"and it's never lost a case. This is a slanderous, 
liable statement and he (Spielmann) should be 
punished." 

SpielmaM claimed that he was "not 
personally attacking" Hyman or 8ekken, who 
played instrumental roles in the lormation of the 
existing student advocate program. 

recruitment, Wallon .aid. He belieVei this play 
will increale retention of students, thereby 
attracting new prospects to Third College. 

Kane stressed the importance of a "referral, 
rellOurce and reference center." A. an 
undergraduate at UCSD, he felt that more 
emphalis should have been put on infonning 

stu~nts of the many benefits and programs 
aV8Jlable to help them develop_academically. 

Kane argued that although UCSD has many 
programl of thil nature, such as SCURI, the 
Student Center for Undergraduate Research 
and Innovation, they are not well known by the 
studentl. Other opportunities include summer 
internships, study at other universitiel, 
departmental honors, and Phi Beta Kappa. 

STOP 9 Rallies 
Conlinued from page I 
Field Poll that showed 48 percent of Califor· 
nians lurveyed are against Prop. 9. Only 43 
percent are in favor of it.

coordinator 01 the student lobby. "We think 43 
percent il still too many people to be IUp.....h..ft 9." t""'-'8 

According to Grey Panthen Letislative 
Chairman Mildred Becker, the rally 
represented a turning point in the political 
scene. "More people are recognizing their 
power to effect change. We are not going to be 
bamboozled by these pie·in·the·sky promise. " 
Becker said. ' 

In a press conference before the rally, a 
representative from Student Vote 1980 
alVlOunced that record numbers of California's 
almost two million college students w~1 be going 
to the polls this year. Ninety.three percent of 
UC Davil students and 75 percent of San

to vote according to the Registrar of Voterl 
said D~ne .Brownsey, legislative advocate 10;

In the age of athletics, when it is 
f8lhionable to go on Itrike, boycott 
international competitin, and generally 
bitch and moan about a group of lilly

remaina a large contingent of every.day

up their favorite activity. And if you look 
around campua on any spring day, you'D

UCSD Becoming Prime Site for V-ball Tourneys 
Hosting Hath Its Priviledges, And Not Just Home Crowd: 
Scheduling Can Be Arranged for Maximum Benefit 

BY TIM LIOTTA 
Sports Editor 

Is UCSD becoming the 
volleyball capital of the world? 

This past weekend UCSD 
was the site for the National 
Invitational Volleyball 
Tournament. It was the 
second volleyball tournament 
held at UCSD this year. In 
January, the Men's "AII·CaI" 
volleyball tournament took 
place in the Main Gym. Each 
were highlights in the 
schedules of volleyball teams 
on the west coast. 

"I really love tournaments," 
said Doug Dannevik, "the 
atmosphere is great. There is 
always something happen. 
ing." 

Next year UCSD will have 
another ambitious schedule as 
Dannevik, UCSD volleyball 
coach, has scheduled two 
more tournaments. An 
invitational tournament for top 
women's volleyball teams has 
already attracted the interest 

. of teaml in Southern 
California. Penn State and 
Ohio State have already 
expressed interest in 
competing in the 1981 
National Invitational 
Tournament. / 

UDSD is in a prime location 
to hold a tournament. It offers 
the luxury of San Diego's great 
weather to participants in 
coaxing teams to participate. 
The lurrounding beauty of the 

Reg, $7.98

this week 

beach and California surf can 
entice any volleyball coach out 
of his back yard . 

"Everybody loves to come 
to San Diego," said Dannevik, 
"It's a lot nicer than going to a 
tournament in La Verne or 
Riverside." 

Another advantage UCSD 
enjoys is that it is located so 

The Daily' Guardian 

Sports 
close to the top volleyball 
schools in the country . 
California is renowned for its 
volleyball competition. This 
makes it much easier on the 
budget of a school which might 
be struggling financially. 

The Main Gym at UCSD 
can accomodate two 
volleyball games at one time. 
This limits the number of 
schools which can compete in 
a given tournament. 

"If the Rec Gym floor 
wasn't so bad," Dannevik 
said, "we could have a 30 
team tournament." 

Hosting a volleyball 
townament can be a lot of fun 
both for the team 'and ita 
coach. But there i. also a lot of 
work involved. 

After the achedules are 
drawn up, a tournament 
acoresheet has to be made for 

keeping a running account of 
the tournament' s progress. 
Teams also have to be 
scheduled to help out referees. 
But despite the paper work 
these . tasks plus playing the 
role of P A announcer keep 
Dannevik extremely busy 
throughout the event. 

All of these jobs keep 
Dannevik away from his team 
more and that can be a 
problem in a tournament 
situation. 

" I'm not able to give any 
pregame talks or spend as 
much time as I should with the 
team," says Dannevik . 

In a tournament, a team 
plays several mat.ches in a row 
and if a problem arises it must 
be taken care of immediately. 
If a coach cannot be around 
his team enough, the answer 
just might not come. 

Being the host school does 
have its advantages, however. 
Since it makes the schedules, it 
can give itself the best time and 
play the opponents in any 
order it wishes. 

"The host team always 
givea itself a good draw," said 
assistant volleyball coach 
Mich Kobara. "It's just one of 
the advantages. Everybody 
does it." 

UCSD seemed to have this 
luxury in the NIVT when, on

'Music' Does the Talking With IDlpediDlent 
The Joe Perry Project Let the

The inevitable comparison 
of Perry's debut solo effort 
with Aerosmith 's last release is 
favorable . For what it 's worth. 
Perry exhibits the same 
penchants for riff.writing and 
for creating a collage effect 
with the haphazard placement 
of hooks, riffs. breaks, and

lame guitar solos throughout 
his compositions. The tunes 
them se lv es follow th e 
funk/ ro c k formula which 
brought you "Wa lk This 
Way," "Get It Up," a nd 
"Three-Mil e Smile," with a 
sma ttering of straight .ahead 
rock n' roll thrown in so you 
won 't forget that Perry is 
ostensibly a rocker. Plus a six-
minute long mood piece, 
" Misty Day," which might 
possibly be a contender for the 
"worst song ever written by 
anyone in the 20th century" 
award that John Cage has thus 
far successfully monopolized .

A brief in s trumental , 
"Break Song," graces the end 
of side one and is most 
felicitously entitled , since 
Perry's horribly out-of·tune 
guitar sounds broken . His 
back up band is an e xcellent 
garage .bred facsimile of 
Aerosmith , with the exception 
of the lead vocalist , who may 
have taken voice lessons from 
Perry. The lyrical content of 
the ma terial approximates Dr.

Robin Trower Viclims of the 
Fury (Chrysal is) 

Trower has returned from a 
three .year vacation to resume 
where he left off , which is in the 
$ 1.99 bargain bin at most 
record stores, notwithstanding 
his first two albums, which 
were superb. 

a jazzy piece which highlights 
vocalist James Dewar's 
formidable talents. Dewar is 
right at home on the slow, 
mellow piece , his deep, gruff , 
but tempered timbre fitting 

smoothly and fluidly into the 
mellow, but powerful Trower 
chord phrasing. I have always 
considered Dewar 10 be an 
immensely underra ted vocalist 
who deserves recognition 

along with Brad Delp, uI 
Rogers, and Frankie Mil. 81

stylists to emerge in the ~.

This album is a potpourri of 
material which could ha ve 
appea red on subsequ ent 
Trower albums. Hard rock is 
represented , a s is the funky 
stuff Trower got into after 
"Bridge of Sighs" and the jazz. 
influ e nced " Cara va n to

Trower is to be commended 
for hi s versatility. "Fly Low" is Fallowing' a brief period of retirement in aeclulion, ZZ Top have come back with. twilled Mel bizarre record.

romantic comedy. The 
romance, between a 61.year. 
old pale, subdued and elderly 
looking Walter Matthau and a 
46.year-old looking-younger· 
every· year Julie Andrew" 
stretches one', incredulity a bit 
too far, and the comedy is 
simply not fumy. 

nul ia not to lAy that Uttle 
Mi.. Marker ia not 

entertaining. It is. It jUlt isn' t 
romantic or funnv. 

Henry Mancini', title muaic 
il a thumping, bouncy bit of 
ragime which perfectly evokes 
a mood of 30. noatalgia. The 
plot concerns a bookie called 
Sorrowful Jones (Matthau) 
and his run·ins with a unall· 
time hood (Tony Curtil) and 
his prospective mistreu 
(Andrews) . Curtis forces 
Matthau to invest in a 
gambling joint in Andrew's 
mansion, but they go broke. 
Curtis forces Matthau to fix a 
race so Andrew's horse will 
win but they go broke again. 
Curtis then wants to kill 
Matthau , but Matthau talks 
Curtis out of it and marries 
Andrews. Within this muck of 
a plot are two good 
perfonnances and another 
plot. 

Bob Newhart is wonderful 
as the deadpan, little·fellow 
sidekick , a lthough he is 
allowed only a few moments to 

shine in the film. The one 
spark of life in Little Miss 
Marker is the little mill herself, 
Sara Stimson a. "the kid." 

The kid is left at Sorrowful'. 
bookie joint a. a security 
marker for a $10 bet on a 
hone. The horse loses and the 
kid's father commits suicide, 
and Matthau i. stuck with her. 
Stimson'. perfonnance is an 
engaging one, never too cute 
or overdone _ In fact, she 
knows so little about acting 
that she underplays it all the 
way through. The effect is a 
real , natural portrayal, much 
like the early Our Gang type of 
acting. 

Little Miss Mar ker was 
mechanically photographed 
all over Universal 's Roaring 
30& back lot and typically lit, 
edited , written and directed . It 
is not a bad film, but one tha t 
should have been much better_ 
In the end , it is completely 
forgettable.

versatility, but his voice seems 
to fit into the most unlikely 
musical contexts, and it works. 
And , unlike Lou Gramm and 
occasionally Paul Rogen, he 
is always on key - a treat, 
these days. 

Trower , who had tradition· 
ally alternated betwP.en riding 
his Uni·Yibe, wah·wah pedal, 
and Hanger, must have had 

someone hiding one or the 
other effect between takes. 
Although he utilizes all of 
these , they are not overdone to 
the point that the listener is 
inclined to vomit. He even 
forgoes all of the aformention· 
ed on a fiv e· minute long 
obligatory Hendrixesqu e 
blues . There are three songs 
on the album worth listening

Secluaion and a brief period 
of retirement have warped 
theae former hard rock dietary 
ataples. While their latest 
effort reflects the quintessence 
of their former powerful and 
droning style, there is 
something twisted and bizarre 
about this record. 

An interesting remake of 
the Sam and Dave classic, " I 
Thank You" is a devious ploy 
to lull the listener into 
expecting laid-back ZZ rock. 
The production is minimal, 
and adequate for the material. 
Sui»equent tunes reaffirm the 
impreulon one gets that this is 
a solid effort, and that 
although the a1bwn is not the 
masterpiece df dreg-rock Tres 
Hombres was, it is neverthe-
leu very good. 

Then auddenly. . . 
"Manic Mechanic" is the 

last tune on the album, and its 
stark contrast to the other 

songs might indicate that it 
was added as an afterthought. 
However, from certain clues 
given on the cover and inner 
sleeve, I am not so sure that 
this is the case. In fact , 
although one Rolling Stone 
reviewer dismiued the song as 
" ... ZZ Top's token entry into 
the New Wave market. .. ," I 
will instead argue that it is 
brilliant, and a legitimate two-
minute masterpiece . A 
preliminary listen weirds the 
listener out. This is z:z Top!? 
Sounds like something Zappa 
would do. Another listen will 
reveal that there is little real 
difference between the song 
and any other well·written z:z 
tune instrumentally. The 
production is merely superb 
and the arrangement and 
concept behind the song defy 
description. On the basis of the 
rest of the material, the album 
merits a 8 minus. "Manic 
Mechanic" is worth the 
purchase price of the album. 8 
plus.

numbers game. Numbers are 
important, but whether we're 
going to lose $12.5 billion or 
$2.5 billion, vital services are 
going to be cut. "The figures 
we want to talk about are the 
95 percent of the state's three 
million enior citizens whose 
incomes are so low they don't 
even file income tax , and the 
three percent of the people at 
the top of the income scale 
who will be receiving a third of 
the savings if Jarvis II passes," 
said Harris. 

Harris also pointed out that 
almost $1. 1 billion of the 
Jarvis II tax relief will go to the 
federal government in the form 
of income tax on increased 
revenues . 

"Washington has already 
received a gift of $1.9 billion 
from California because of 
Prop. 13," said Harris.

Student Lobby campus 
coordinator, is using his

Milton Fr.iedman,

a sound way to legislate tax

there wai have to be cuts 
and we will all lose. With 
these facts in mind I urge all

They could either allow the 
students to go through another 
embassy of a country friendly 
with both nations or allow 
students to go through Iranian 
bands directly, an official 
stated. 

Most UCSD Iranian 
students don't foresee any 
financial difficulties for several 
months . On the whole , 
students are adopting a "wait 
and see" attitude. 

Iranian students have few 
alternatives if their support is 
cut off, Clark said. She pointed 
out that they won't be eligible 
for financial aid since its only 
for American students. 

Foreign students are 
allowed to work up to 20 hours

overall." 

It may also require new 
legislation-which will be 
difficult to generate given the 
reduced political influence of 
Blacks. Congressman 
Augustus Hawkins, co·author 
of the important Humphrey. 
Hawkins Employment Act, is 
now supporting full funding of 
CET A to target jobs to the 
neediest, and the increase the 
number of jobs as unemploy-
ment rises. 

Others look to "global 
solutions. " "Andrew Young 
always said that because of the 
American need for oil, this 
country would have to go to 
the Third World, and the 
Third World would rather deal 
with Blacks," Waters points 
out. "In fact , his trade mission 
to Nigeria was all about 
building business for 
blacks ... The horizon is big. It's 
a whole new day." 

But now everyone agrees 
that the Third World will help. 
"I'm more concerned about 
our domestic losses since the 
GOs," counters Watson. "We 
see a re-kindling of the KKK. 
And groups like the NAACP, 
the SCLC, the Urban League, 
and 10 forth, are lacking the 
support they once could find." 

We'll have to corne to grips 
with the educational-picture. 
What was true in '54 is not 
true in '~. 'We worked very
