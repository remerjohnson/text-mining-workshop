UCSD. Last year, those four letters might have been 
completely meaningless to you. Maybe you saw it on a 
sweatshirt or on a flyer once. But now, those four letters 
are about to become your everything. You are a Triton 
now, and that can be a bit scary and confusing at first. So 
The Guardian, UCSD’s campus newspaper, made a handy 
guide to answer your most frequent questions while accli-
mating to your new home. Tuck this bad boy in the front 
pocket of your Jansport and pull it out whenever you’re 
feeling a little confused. Or read ahead and when one of 
your suite mates asks “What’s PC?” or “Where can I get a 
good breakfast burrito?” You’ll know the answer.

The  Guide 
to  the

 Six-College  
System 

If you haven’t already figured it out, UCSD is a unique school. Our library looks like a spaceship, we 
spend one day each year worshipping 
a statue of a bird, and we have six col-
leges. You’ve probably already heard a 
bit about your particular college during 
orientation, but what about the other 
five colleges? We’re here to tell you what 
matters and what you don’t have to 
worry about.

The college system is designed to give 
students the feeling of going to a smaller 
liberal-arts school while also attending a 
larger university. As far as dorms, gen-
eral education classes, dining halls and 
a lot of the friends you’ll make in your 
first year, your college is home base. 
You’ll spend most of your time there, 

and you’re most likely going to make 
your first few friends in your suite and 
some of your college-centered activi-
ties (like the Unolympics). It seems far 
from now, but you’ll also graduate with 
your college. But don’t worry, the college 
system isn’t as limiting as it may seem. 
Once you join some student organiza-
tions and meet people from the other 
depths of campus, you won’t worry too 
much about who comes from where 
(even though that’s usually how you’ll 
identify yourself). Once you’re done 
with GEs and move off campus, you’ll 
hardly remember your college’s name at 
all. That stuff just doesn’t matter as much 
once you’re a junior or senior. But for 
now, it matters a whole lot, so here’s the 
rundown on UCSD’s six colleges. 

5 Colleges



It’s the college with the hardest G.E. requirements, possibly the least popu-lar dining hall, and the oldest dorms 
on campus — it’s Revelle College. Despite 
what some perceive as negatives, Revelle 
has a lot of nuances that students in other 
colleges overlook. The Humanities G.E., or 
Hum, requires intensive reading and writ-
ing, but the five full quarters will enhance 
students’ analytical skills and provide bal-
ance for non-humanities majors.

Plaza Cafe is — or was — far away from 
everywhere else on campus, and its menu 
was often lackluster, but students grew to 
love its food, its convenience and its prox-
imity to Roger’s Place and Market. Plaza 
and Roger’s will both be closed for reno-
vations this year, so Revelle students 
will have to get cozy with their Muir 
College peers: Pines and John’s Place 
and Market are a short walk away for a 
convenient — and perhaps superior — 
dining experience.

If you’re housed in Argo Hall or 

Blake Hall, congratulations — you’re in the 
oldest dorms on campus. Although they 
might not be the cleanest, the tight layout 
of suites offers an easy way to socialize. If 
you’re housed in one of the recently reno-
vated Fleet halls, your suite’s likely to have 
a homey feeling and very thick walls. Use 
the latter with great appreciation.

Revelle is at the bottom of campus, and 
non-Revelle students mainly visit for 
classes in York Hall, but that doesn’t mean 
Revelle has nothing else to offer. The col-
lege is close to the (Old) Student Center 
(the less-corporate, chilled-out predeces-
sor to Price Center), Main Gym (which 
saves you a trip to RIMAC), and Galbraith 
Hall, which provides study spaces in a 

non-library environment. Revelle is 
also home to the Theatre District, 
where you can watch student pro-
ductions at any of the venues in the 
La Jolla Playhouse.

Roger  Revelle Colleges6



John  Muir
UCSD’s second college is John Muir College, named after an environmentalist of the same 
moniker and — interestingly — home 
to a concrete jungle with a certain 
overgrown prison-like quality.
However, if you’re coming in as a 

Muir student, you’re in luck on more 
than a few counts: Muir College con-
veniently squashed lecture halls, living 
quarters (the newly built Tamarack 
Apartment towers are gorgeous), and 
dining options within a centrally-
located, walkable block, so you’ll have 
ready access to Pines — one of the uni-
versity’s best dining halls — and Roots, 
UCSD’s resident option for vegan cui-
sine. With over five lecture halls only 
five minutes away, though, you may 
have to hit the gym more often than 

you expected. Thankfully, Muir’s recre-
ational Main Gym and Natatorium are 
also within walking distance.

Muir College is also lucky enough 
to boast some of the university’s most 
flexible college general requirements, 
with only a two-course college writing 
program and requirements in science, 
social sciences and humanities that 
can be fulfilled in a variety of simple 
ways.

Students of Muir College are known 
as UCSD’s social bunch. As the home 
of activities like Muirstock and John 
Muir Week and over 30 different stu-
dent organizations (and as custodian 
of Sun God Lawn), Muir’s unlikely to 
leave you bored. And did we mention 
the beach? Muir’s a mere 10-minute 
walk away.

T h u rg o o d
M a rs h a ll
As a college with the beach as its backyard and a hump (yes, a hump) in its middle, Thurgood Marshall College can be thought of as that kind, quiet, justice-driven friend who makes fairly 
good burritos.

The college sits near the top of Peterson Hill, making it close to major 
lecture halls, among them Solis Hall, Sequoyah Hall and — you guessed 
it — Peterson Hall, but a trek from central university spots like 
Price Center and some other colleges. Marshall is also 
quite close to UCSD’s RIMAC gym, for those 
of you who are bored or tired of studying 
for Dimensions of Culture in your alpha-
betically arranged, gender-separated 
residential halls.

Speaking of DOC, Marshall is 
home to the surprisingly engag-
ing three-quarter writing se-
quence required for freshmen. 
The series introduces students 
to issues including social jus-
tice, diversity and inequality 
— in true Associate Supreme 
Court Justice Thurgood Mar-
shall form.

And like all Supreme Court 
justices, Marshall residents 
have to eat. Students can choose 
between the not-particularly-
tempting dining hall Oceanview 
Terrace and the aforementioned 
Goody’s Place and Market burritos, 
which is by far the better choice.

Ea r l  Wa r r en
Tucked between dueling canyons in the northeast corner of campus, Earl Warren College is as full of rabbits and raccoons as it is with engineering 
students. The college’s motto, “Toward a life in balance,” 
is reflected in the relatively moderate G.E. requirements, 
with each student needing to pick six classes (fewer for 
engineers) in Programs of Concentration, or PofC, in two 
areas other than their major. All Warren students must 
also take two quarters each of Warren Writing and Ethics 
and Society.

Though a bit removed from the other six residential 
areas, Warren’s Earl’s Place boasts perhaps HDH’s best 
coffee service, and the living area’s integrated volleyball 
and basketball amenities, as well as the nearby Warren 
Field and Canyonview Aquatic Center provide a haven 
for active residents.

Students in Warren (whose modern-esque residence 
halls and sizable apartments are all named for Supreme 
Court justices of the Earl Warren court) will enjoy short 
walks to Warren Lecture Hall (WLH), the Literature 
Building and the engineering buildings that line Warren 
Mall. Warren Advising, Warren College Student Council 
and Warren Writing all based out of the nearby Computer 
Science and Engineering Building, or EBU3B. Book-
focused residents can find solace in one of two Warren 
study lounges in JK Wood Lounge and The Courtroom.

There’s a feeling you get walk-ing around ERC that makes it feel like it might not be real. It 
could come from the pristine dorms 
(the newest and probably the nicest 
on campus), or the postcard-worthy 
ocean view, maybe it’s that, perched 
on the northwest corner of campus, 
it’s isolated from the main flow of 
student traffic. Or maybe it’s just that 
its proximity to RIMAC gym and the 
Triton Track & Field Stadium gives it 
an unusually high proportion of unre-
alistically good-looking athletes.
Although somewhat of a trek from 

the rest of campus, ERC has — at least 
to a certain extent — some draws of 
its own. It’s home to International 
House (on-campus housing for half 
domestic and half international stu-
dents), which is known for having 
some of UCSD’s best parties. For late 
night after-the-after-party snacks, 
you’ll have multiple options: dorms 
are close to both Goody’s or the Vil-

lage Place and Market. And in the 
morning, head to Cafe V, where the 
beautiful view will hopefully distract 
from the barely recognizable piles of 
sludge on your plate. If you’re willing 
to shell out some non-dining dollar 
cash, Home Plate (a sports bar-slash-
hamburger joint) and Peet’s Coffee 
are nearby with slightly more edible 
options, not to mention — though in 
ERC, it’s a given — great views.

ERC is known for its international 
focus and mission to make students 
“global citizens,” notable mostly 
through its strenuous sequence of 
hybrid world history, philosophy 
and research essay-writing G.E.s, the 
five-course Making of the Modern 
World program. Students have a 
love-to-hate-it attitude when it comes 
to MMW, and they celebrate comple-
tion of the courses every year with an 
ERC-wide MMW Blowout party. Yes, 
ERC kids work long and hard, but 
they look good doing it.

Sixth
Sixth College is UCSD’s newest college, with the formidable slogan of “Culture, Art & Technology” to make up for its lack of a proper name. It occupies the southeastern part of campus, marked by a 
slew of cabin-style dorms that are affectionately nicknamed “Camp 
Snoopy” by returning students. If you’re a Sixth College freshman, 
chances are a few of your first classes will be located in Pepper Canyon 
Hall, Sixth College’s main administration building. Unfortunately, this 
probably means you’ll have long walks to your classes across campus. 
Located next to Gilman Parking structure, PCH is where you’ll meet 
your academic counselor as well. Sixth’s tiny dining hall, Foodworx Place 
and Market, is limited in both food choices and seating. However, it’s 
also usually far less crowded than Pines, with an outdoor dining area and 
music that ultimately makes for a quiet lunch break. Sixth’s slogan lends 
its name to the college’s writing program, CAT. Stu-
dents take an initial sequence of three writing classes 
that is later capped with a course on public speaking 
and a practicum project. Sixth is known for having 
fairly lax GE requirements that are heavy on the 
humanities and easily filled by Advanced Placement 
classes. At Sixth, you’ll be close to a number of ath-
letic and recreational areas, like basketball courts and 
a soccer field located right by Foodworx. You’ll also 
have a short walk to the Canyonview Aquatic Center, 
which houses two Olympic-sized pools and a spa.

Sixth
Strictly speaking, The Village isn’t part of the six-college system. It’s a relatively new housing community for transfer students 
(and some upperclassmen) located in breezy 
North Campus, just past ERC. Although apart-
ments in the Village are a lot newer than most 
campus housing (some even have ocean views!), 
the cost is about the same. Sadly, there’s no stu-
dent parking nearby, and it’s a long walk to most 
lecture halls (usually about a mile), so getting 
familiar with the shuttle system isn’t a bad idea. 
Students often park nearby at Gliderport, but 
beware of getting an unwanted ticket — it’s been 
known to happen.

Village East and West are separated by 
Scholar’s Drive, and though both have their 
own laundry facilities and study areas, neither 
one is completely independent from the other. 
Residential Services are located in Village West 
Building 2, with The Bistro and the Village 
Market just across the way in Village East. The 
Bistro is the Village equivalent of a dining hall, 
only it’s an actual sit-down restaurant and it’s 
closed on weekends. It’s a little pricey, but worth 
checking out if you’ve got a few Dining Dollars 
to spare and a hankering for sushi. The Market 
has a lot of great grab-n-go options, and a pretty 
good variety of products, but they tend to run 
low during finals week so shop accordingly!

While it might be uncommon to hear “dining hall” and 
“cool” in the same sentence, Pines 
comes closest — at least at UCSD 
— to reaching that standard. 
Redesigned to offer students an al-
ternative to the traditional dining 
hall experience, Pines also focuses 
on sustainability and environmen-
tal friendliness, offering a number 
of vegetarian and vegan options 
at every meal. Though you’ll find 

some dining hall staples (stay away 
from the over-salted soups), some 
of your choices are downright 
classy — sushi, stir fry, hand-
carved sandwich stations and a 
well-stocked salad bar should 
satisfy most preferences. Pines’ 
central location, open atmosphere 
and ample seating and TVs make 
it a good choice for just about 
anyone, so beware of checkout 
lines, which can get long around 
noon and 6 p.m.

Mandeville  Coffee
Cart Art of 

Espresso }
Often, students’ complaints about lackluster food options on campus are 
legitimate — but this coffee cart, 
situated just outside the Mandeville 
Auditorium, makes an excep-
tion. Serving all the fair-trade 
(and fairly priced) coffee-snob-
quality espresso with none of the 
pretentiousness, it’s no surprise that 
the cart -- which (rightfully) calls 
itself “The Art of Espresso” — is 
often ranked near the top on lists 
of “the best coffee in San Diego.” 
Open from 7 a.m. until 5 p.m. 
Monday through Thursday and 

until 4:30 p.m. on Friday, this is the 
place to spend your non-dining 
dollar money. The line can get long 
between classes, but service is fast 
and friendly — just make sure to 
bring cash if you want to avoid the 
25-cent pay-by-card fee. For your 
friends who haven’t yet realized 
their caffeine dependency, the cart 
sells solid scones, sandwiches and 
salads from Price Center’s Zanzibar 
at the Loft, and enough creative 
sugary hot and cold drinks to keep 
anyone happy. (Case in point: 
blended chai + whole banana + ice 
= spiced monkey.)

Sunshine Market
Best  Munchies

Although it doesn’t accept Dining Dollars, the independently-owned Sunshine Market provides an impressive selection of snacks, 
healthy and sugar-filled alike, should you wish to 
escape the UCSD markets’ high prices and limited 
offerings. Sunshine Market is a one-stop grocery store 
nestled next to Chase Bank in Price Center East and 
sells a surprising variety of between-class snacks: soda, 
candy, milk, produce, sandwiches, locally baked bread 
and pastries and even chocolate truffles are always in 
good supply. There’s even a fairly extensive self-serve 
coffee bar. Sunshine offers aisles full of all the munch-
ies imaginable, with smoothies, a soup bar, several 
brands of microwavable frozen burritos even some 
classy imported European desserts if you want to blend 
in with your friends at I-House.

Club
 Med

Best  Lunch
dining17



A lot of students confine themselves to their local dining hall, opting not to branch out because everything else is just, well, too 
far. But every once in a while, you might want to 
try something new, and Club Med, tucked away 
in the middle of the UCSD School of Medicine 
campus — is just the place to do that. What puts 
Club Med a notch above the rest is its selection 
of hot sandwiches, and especially its more casual 
eating environment, which provides an escape 
from the fluorescent, sometimes prison-like dining 
hall experience. There are far fewer undergrads 
running around, so you can really sit back and eat 
your lunch with peace and quiet you won’t find 
on the rest of campus. And you’re in luck — Club 
Med does take Dining Dollars, so you don’t have to 
spend hard-earned to enjoy a good meal.

Hare  Krishna
Best  Grab-and-Go

dining18

The Hare Krishna buffet is by far the best grab-and-go deal you can find. The Hare Krishnas are 
a non profit missionary organization 
that looks to distribute the science of 
self realization. Although the long line 
extending from the Co-op to Porter’s 
Pub may make for a slow-paced grab, 
you’ll walk away with enough food for 
the rest of the week — as long as you 
come prepared. That is because one 

can buy a plate of food for $5, or $6 for 
all-you-can-eat, which means bringing 
your giant Tupperware container and 
filling it up is fair game. The food is In-
dian inspired vegetarian dishes, which 
certainly isn’t for everyone, but don’t be 
deterred by the mushy aesthetic of the 
entrées before giving it a chance. It is 
located in the quad of the Old Student 
Center and serves every Wednesday 
from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.

The Village
 Place and Market

Best  Market

Taking the cake as UCSD’s best mar-ketplace, the Village Place and Market is located by transfer housing all the 
way on the north side of campus next to The 
Village and ERC. Accepting Dining Dollars 
and Triton Cash (as well as normal currency), 
the market is by far the largest in size, has 
beautiful, open, modern design and offers 
the greatest variety by combining some of 
the best aspects of its contenders. An efficient 
one-stop location for food, 
you can order custom pizzas, 
purchase full Costco-style 
rotisserie chickens, pasta sal-
ads and fruit salads and at the 
same time pick up dorm-room 
groceries and order coffee and 
pastries. Open until 1 a.m. 
every night, you’re guaranteed 
to see — and may one day 
join — full armies of students 
returning from parties or 
beginning all-nighters trek-
king to the Village Place and 
Market in search of premium 
late-night munchies.

The Secret 
Cookie Service

Best  Delivery

Operating out of a top-secret, un-disclosed loca-
tion, The Secret Cookie 
Service is hands down 
the most exciting way to 
eat a cookie. The SCS has 
become a hit at UCSD 
with a crew of dapper 
secret agents dressed 
in suits and sunglasses 
who deliver platters of 
cookies around campus 
and the San Diego area 
as late as 2 a.m. Your 
order is placed through 
a text, using a special 
code to indicate how 
many and what kind of 
cookies you’d like. The 
cookies come in flavors 
like M&M’s, orange 
creamsicle and good old 
chocolate chip. The SCS 
delivers to campus every 
day, and their late-night 
hours make them espe-
cially tempting during 
finals week. Be sure to 
like them on Facebook 
for their daily deals 
and a rundown of their 
secret cookie code.

While not nearly as flashy as Price Center, the Old Student Center — officially called the Student Center — is home to a number of core student groups and activities. Groundwork 
Books, the General Store and the Food Co-op make up the center’s co-ops, 
a group of student-run and student-owned nonprofits that market reduced 
prices on food, books and a variety of other student necessities. (The Food 
Co-op sells the cheapest coffee and bagels, at $1 each, on the entire cam-
pus.) The Old Student Center has a relaxed vibe and is perfect for low-key 
solo study sessions or just hanging around, listening to KSDT radio’s live 
broadcast or filling up a plate full of Hare Krishna food every Wednesday. 
Plenty of shade, seating and Wi-Fi makes it an attractive alternative to the 
corporate, hustle-and-bustle feel of PC. Several other shops and student 
organizations also call the Old Student Center home. (Like the Guardian! 
Come say hi to us any Wednesday or Sunday.)

feature about its 
campus: trees. 
In celebration of 
the campus’ eu-
calyptus tree take-

includes three 
trees sprinkled 
near Library Walk 
that are called 
the Talking Tree, 
the Singing Tree,

Tree can be heard 
spouting out an 
eclectic mix of

sounds, from 
opera, to jazz, to 
Navajo chants, 
while the Talking

the central loca-
tion for many of 
UCSD’s protests

Silent Tree is 
molded around a

Staffed by the students who help run Wilderness Orien-tation, Outback Adventures 
offers a wide variety of outdoor 
trips during the school year that 
range from kayaking in Mission 
Bay to climbing the boulders of 
Joshua Tree National Park. While 
somewhat pricey, the cost is well 
worth a weekend getaway once 
free transportation and profes-
sional instruction are factored in.

For those who seek adventure 
on their own, Outback’s rental 

shop behind Pepper Canyon Hall 
in Sixth College offers a variety 
of gear, from surfboards and 
snowboards to tents and sleeping 
bags (always a popular option for 
students heading to Coachella).

On campus, Outback runs 
the UCSD Outback Adventures 
Surf Shop (where you can make 
use of a student discount) in 
Price Center West, as well as 
UCSD’s small — but social — 
rock climbing wall in Canyon-

while you’re stuck at UCSD, savvy 
developers have placed a veritable — 
and newly remodeled — mini-suburbia 
of retail, restaurants, and diversions, 
all a five-minute bus ride from campus 
(from the Gilman/Myers stop, the Route 
201/202 SuperLoop will take you straight 
there). At UTC, clothing stores, in partic-
ular, abound — chains like Abercrombie 
and Fitch, Vans, Nordstrom, and J. Crew 
are all within eyeshot of one another. 
And if retail makes you hungry, grab 
fresh bread at Boudin Bakery, a sandwich 
from Which Wich and a free chocolate 
of the month at Godiva Chocolatier. For 
an evening out with a special someone, 
head to the UTC ice skating rink (though 
beware the $15 skate rental fee). Later 
on, a movie at the glitzy ArcLight theater 
(which has a built-in bar inside) will give 
any night a happy ending.

Boisterous and energetic on many nights, Por-ter’s Pub is probably the best out of five places on campus to socialize with a beer in hand — 
and not just because ID checks happen infrequently.

The pub has a wide and rotating selection of 
local craft beers and cheap dining (check out 

the $3 menu every day until 7 p.m.), and 
the chill barroom atmosphere — rare 
on a college campus — makes up for 
the sometimes-slow service. The pub’s 

frequent musical events are usually more 
expensive than those at The Loft, but they 
periodically boast real musical heavy-
weights, with performances this past year 

ranging from Foals to Tyler the Creator.

Yes, it is a nud-ist beach. 
No, it isn’t Europe, 
where you’ll find 
hot, young col-

all. What you will 
find are a handful of 
middle-aged men, 
naked, and then a 
handful of UCSD

Not everyone 
who visits Black’s 
Beach is there to go 
naked-man-gazing 
— most come for 
the relaxing beach 
environment, the 
nice trek down the 
hill to the beach (and 
the not-as-nice trek back up) and 
the paragliders overhead. Avoid 
the crowds at La Jolla Shores and 
bring your friends to Black’s as an 
in-between-classes stress reliever 
(yes, it really is that close), and 
maybe, if you’re feeling it, you can 
embrace the nudist lifestyle, too.

La  Jolla  Cove
It’s fun, it’s free and there’s wildlife everywhere. Liter-ally, everywhere. As a definite 
favorite for students, tourists and 
families alike, La Jolla Cove really 
is the perfect place for swimming, 
snorkeling, kayaking and even 
having a picnic. As a result of its 
near-universal appeal, the eco-
logically protected site does tend 
to get crowded, and the parking 

nightmare may persuade you to 
jump into the nearby ocean (in-
stead, take the Route 30 bus from 
the La Jolla Playhouse by Revelle 
College — it’ll get you there in 
around 25 minutes). But hey — the 
more the merrier. The cove is also a 
convenient, walkable distance from 
Downtown La Jolla, with great food 
and shopping that’ll really make it 
worth the trip.

As a beach town that's been coasting on its prime locale for over a century, Downtown 
La Jolla can feel unsettlingly precious: 
its buildings are so colorful that they 
look like they belong on Disneyland's 
Main Street, U.S.A., and there seem 
to be 10 expensive cafes for every one 
parking space. You'll see more white 
slacks and gold jewelry than anywhere 
else in San Diego — but it's worth 
visiting just for the spectacle. Take the 

Route 30 from Gilman/Myers with a 
friend and split Crab Cake Eggs Bene-
dict at The Cottage, where free crumb 
cake and coffee are served to customers 
who brave the long wait. (For a cheaper 
meal, chill vibes and a pretty solid 
study space, try Pannikin Coffee and 
Tea.) And to experience old-school La 
Jolla, pay $4 to walk through an under-
ground tunnel to the Sunny Jim Cave, 
which has offered tourists a view of the 
La Jolla Cove from within since 1903.

31 Explore Solana 
Beach

You're 
probably familiar with 

Solana Beach because you tried to 
book a train up to L.A. and realized that, in 

fact, the Solana Beach Amtrak station is far closer 
to UCSD than the Downtown San Diego location. 

(And if you didn't, sorry you're only reading this now.) 
The Route 101 bus line goes straight there from UCSD's 

Gilman/Myers, VA Medical Center and Theater District bus 
stops in under an hour. Places worth checking out are Pizza 
Port (which, once you're 21, has solid deals on craft beers) 

and Cedros Avenue, a touristy but cute shopping and dining 
street. The 21+ Belly Up Tavern is also known to be one of 
the best concert venues in the entire region. As the town’s 

name might suggest, the beaches are nice, too — take 
a walk around Fletcher Cove for a more peaceful 

alternative to the often-crowded San Diego 
coastline.

A San Diego icon, Balboa Park is a veritable haven for stressed-out students 
just north of the Gaslamp Quar-
ter. Its acres of open space and 
walking paths surround can’t-
miss cultural spots in museums, 
theaters, restaurants and the San 
Diego Zoo. The park’s 17 muse-
ums cover every area of interest, 
from fine art to classic cars. Your 

student ID will get you a discount 
ticket to all of the museums, as 
well as free admission to a rotat-
ing handful of museums on Tues-
days. Balboa Park also houses the 
lauded Old Globe Theatre, where 
you’ll find world-class Shake-
speare — and world premiere 
musicals (think Into the Woods) 
— at a discounted student price 
(so bring your ID!).

If La Jolla is too calm for to suit your taste, the nightlife in Downtown San Diego — 
accessible if you can stomach the 
trafficky bus ride from UCSD’s 
Gilman/Myers stop (take Route 
30 or 150) — offers a nice change 
of pace. The Gaslamp Quarter is 
known for its plentiful (if pricey) 
assortment of clubs and bars, and 
if you’re not old enough to drink, 
you can always eat! Grab a mar-

garita and some enchiladas at the 
festive Cafe Coyote. If you want 
to explore the San Diego theater 
circuit or music scene, this is the 
place. There’s also shopping in 
Horton Plaza or Seaport Village, 
or you could watch some baseball 
at Petco Park (Unless any decent 
team is in town, go, Padres!). 
There’s plenty to do harborside as 
well: visit Little Italy, or hop across 
the bay and explore Coronado!

PB is often dismissed as being reserved for the 21+, bar-hopping crowd, but it’s got plenty to keep underclassmen busy. 
First off, PB is home to the closest In-N-Out to 
campus, right off I-5’s Garnet/Balboa exit. PB is 
the place to go for tattoos and piercing parlors 
(Enigma is a favorite), and further down Garnet 
Avenue are hordes of clothing stores, thrift shops, 
restaurants and even a few casual bars (for one, 
Ciro’s Pizzeria and Beerhouse) that don’t require 
valid IDs — as long as you’re not planning to 
drink. The boardwalk and beach itself are a 
quick walk from the Garnet strip. The beach 
may not be as picturesque as La Jolla Shores, but 
it’s a much friendlier, relaxed environment with 
people, dogs and stoned hobos alike (there are 
plenty of dispensaries in PB as well). PB’s Garnet 
Avenue does have a bumpin’ bar scene for those 
over 21, with bars that vary from the south-of-
the-border-themed Cabo Cantina to sports bars, 
like Miller’s Field. Bar-hoppers should expect 
cover charges on weekends and pretty limited 
parking. (Have cash on hand!)

If you’re fed up with what can feel like a bland selection at Price Center and the Westfield UTC Mall, take 
the Hillcrest/Campus (H) shuttle south 
to Hillcrest for one-of-a-kind shopping 
and dining. Anchored by a branch of the 
UCSD Medical Center, 
Hillcrest is a fun, LGBT-

that hosted the Pride 
Festival and Parade this 
summer. It’s home to the

If the Westfield UTC mall is a UCSD student’s retail refuge, Fashion Valley is a retail para-
dise. Fashion Valley is located in 
Mission Valley, just north of the I-8 
and just west of Route 163 — a mere 
15-minute drive (take I-805) or a 
45-minute bus ride (take the Route 
41 from the Gilman/Myers stop on 
campus). In typical Southern Cali-
fornia fashion, the mall is beautifully 
renovated and is outdoors. Fashion 
Valley is home to over 200 stores and 
restaurants and is often ranked as 
the best and largest shopping loca-

tion in the San Diego area. With an 
abundance of department stores and 
high-end designer locations (ideal 
for window-shopping), a variety of 
upscale but wallet-friendly restau-
rants (P.F. Chang’s, The Cheesecake 
Factory and CPK), tech stores like 
Microsoft, Sony and Apple, as well as 
popular college student havens like 
Forever 21, H&M, Urban Outfitters 
and American Apparel, you’ll find 
retailers that cater to shoppers of all 
kinds. Good thing it’s a trip away, 
because its only flaw is the risk that 
you’ll spend way too much money.

Upperclassmen can attest that the “Freshman 15” is not a myth, so familiarize 
yourself with RIMAC before mid-
term lethargy strikes. RIMAC, lo-
cated in Eleanor Roosevelt College 
(consider the walk there a part of 
your workout) is equipped with ex-
tensive gym basics, like treadmills, 
elliptical and stair machines and a 
weight room that measures 12,000 
square feet. If you’re intimidated by 
the traditional gym room grind — 
or if the bros lifting weights won’t 
let you have a turn — RIMAC also 
has activity rooms (think yoga, 

dance and martial arts) and gym-
nasiums for volleyball, badminton, 
racquetball, dodgeball, basketball 
and even soccer. Plus, it’s open 
until 10 p.m. on school nights.

If you’re bored with your own 
gym routine, you can also sign 
up at RIMAC’s reception desk for 
UCSD-provided recreation classes 
like ballroom dancing or jiu-jitsu. 
For a post-workout reward (or if 
you decide exercise just isn’t your 
thing) head to the nearby Peet’s 
Coffee for a latte or Home Plate for 
a hamburger and, if you’re 21 or 
older, a beer.

RIMAC37 Athletics



Instead of loitering until a treadmill to free up at RIMAC, run the 
four-mile path that makes 
up Campus Loop — and in 
the process, get a free tour 
of UCSD’s six colleges and 
the medical school and enjoy 
views of the ocean, canyon 
and I-5 alike, all in perfect 
sunny but breezy La Jolla 
weather. For the easiest path, 
start in Warren and run 
counter-clockwise. The first 
hill coming out of Warren 
Canyon is the biggest chal-
lenge in the course, so once 
you make it past that (and up 
to Ridgewalk), the rest of the 
way should be a cinch. And if 
you decide you’re not in good 
enough shape to complete the 
four miles, hop on a Campus 
Loop shuttle to get straight 
back to your dorm in no time.

If you’re still disappointed that your Division-I flag football scholarship didn’t pull through, 
intramural sports, or IM sports, 
may be your saving grace. With all 
(or most) of the athleticism and 
none of the pressure, IM sports 
provide a great way to stay in shape, 
make friends and develop — or ac-
quire — athletic ability. A service of 
UCSD Recreation, IM sports are of-
fered year-round, with most games 
taking place in UCSD Rec facilities. 

Sports offerings range from the 
obvious (basketball, soccer, soft-
ball) to more unique options like 
dodgeball, bowling and “inner-tube 
water polo.” You can form a team 
with friends, or join an existing 
team by signing up with the league 
at a meeting at the beginning of the 
season. Sport offerings and signup 
times can be found in the quarterly 
UCSD Recreation catalog, which 
is circulated around campus before 
the start of each quarter.

Although smaller than RIMAC, Main Gym, conveniently located between Revelle and Muir Colleges, is a great workout spot for folks who 
want the machine availability of a larger weight room 
without the crowds. The North Balcony holds a fully 

equipped weight room while the south boasts an impres-
sive gymnastics training facility. Both balconies overlook 

the gym floor with six-hoop basketball, volleyball and 
badminton capability. The gym is sometimes used for 

fencing practices and competitions so make sure to look 
up open court times and the building borders the Natato-

rium aquatic center complete with 25-yard long pool.

Main  Gym



Aside from visiting the two gyms on campus for your daily dose of cardio or swoll, a quick 
walk over to Warren College leads you 
to the Olympic-sized pool where all 
students are allowed to swim freely 
from 9 a.m. until 8 p.m. The abundance 
of lanes mean you won’t have to wait 
your turn to swim a few laps, but if it is 
crowded, the pool is lined with beach 
chairs to lounge. And if there’s ever a 
shortage of swim gear, the Canyonview 
Aqua-Mart can attend to most of your 
needs, though if you’ve forgotten your 
bathing suit, you’re out of luck (and 
probably should think before you swim 
in the first place).

If you’re a tormented sports fan 
with no TV in your 
cramped triple, there 
is really only one place 
on campus you should go 
to: Round Table Pizza. For 
one, they have food and, more 
importantly, beer. If you’re under 21, 
grab a friend who isn’t, make ‘em buy a cheap pitcher of Bud and ask 
for a water cup so you can mooch. (Just don’t get caught — you’ll look 
like a chump.) Round Table has huge TVs, so you won’t have to squint 
to see your favorite team in action. Located in the corner of Price 
Center Plaza next to Jamba Juice, the pizza chain is usually empty 
enough come game time that you won’t have a problem finding a seat. 
But you better hope that your team wins, or else the combination of 
beer, anger and a public place could get embarrassing. Need to wallow 
on your loss? Round Table delivers to your dorms so you can sustain 
your own private pity party.

All good bathrooms have one thing in common: No one goes to them. UCSD’s best 
pisspots aren’t the centrally located, 
high-traffic rooms in PC, but the 
out-of-the-way toilets in Warren 
and the Old Student Center. Girls 
can do no better than the restroom 
on the second floor of Warren’s 
Computer Science and Engineering 
Building, or EBU3B.. It’s spotless, 
well-stocked and usually empty 
(a fact that speaks volumes about 
the number of female engineers on 

campus). It even sports an envi-
ronmentally friendly dryer you put 
your hands into (instead of under). 
For boys, the bathroom on the first 
floor of the Student Center (next 
to the bike shop) is always open, 
always available and always clean. 
Its motion-activated light sensors 
might make the pitch-dark interior 
daunting on first glance, but wait 
a split second and marvel at all the 
excess space. It's almost like peeing 
in the comfort and privacy of your 
own home. But bigger and cleaner.

Nap  SpotsI

f you’re on your third triple-shot mocha, 
still have two more lectures and can’t 
resist the urge to doze off, fear not: 

UCSD’s campus is full of designated “nap 
areas” where you can get some of your 
well-needed ZZZs. The best location for a 
snooze is on the second floor of Geisel Library. Turn left after you enter the 
library, and when you reach the help desk, look to your left again. You’ll see a 
row of cushioned couches facing the window. The window provides a relaxing 
sunbath, and the footrests accompanying them are comfy enough to make 
your nap a restful one. Just make sure to set an alarm, because “I’m just gonna 
rest my eyes” can easily become “I just slept through an o-chem midterm.”

Every UCSD student waits almost all year for the Friday in mid-May when the campus’ midterms-in-
duced stupor gives way to a vibrant flurry 
of music, dance, and everything awesome. 
The Associated Students-sponsored Sun 
God Festival, named for the colorful 
statue that graces Muir College, trans-
forms RIMAC field into a blitz of bright 
lights, pounding subwoofers, and pure, 
unadulterated joy. The acts Sun God draws 
are impressive — last year’s festival brought 
in several up-and-coming artists, such as 
headliners Kendrick Lamar and Porter 
Robinson. Past acts have included Drake, 
B.o.B and Macklemore. You can even cheer 
on fellow UCSD student performers on 
a smaller stage. Just make sure you’re 
conscious enough to appreciate the 
festivities — the music doesn’t 
sound good from the detox 
tent. And by the way: If 
you’re a UCSD student, 
it’s free.

The  Coffee  Cup
In college, there will inevitably come a time when you have to eat 
breakfast with your parents 
while you’re recovering 
from an ill-fated night of 
raging. When this time 
comes, the Coffee Cup in 
Downtown La Jolla has 
your back. The Coffee 
Cup serves an absurdly 
large variety of American, 
European and Mexican 
breakfast dishes that are 
probably too expensive for 
you to eat when mom and 

dad aren’t breaking out their wallets. The coffee is fantastic, the atmosphere 
is serene and the bathrooms are never too far away. Plus, it’s only a couple of 
blocks away from La Jolla Cove, so you can take your parents for a walk once 
you’ve recovered. Be sure to try the French toast (complete with powdered 
sugar and blueberry purée) — it’s probably the best you’ll ever have, regard-
less of how badly your head is hurting.
