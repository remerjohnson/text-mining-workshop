SAN DffiGO - Despite a 
faculty poll in which 76 
percent of the respondents 
agreed that SDSU President 
Thonqas B. Day should retire 
''for the good of the univer-
sity," Day said he has no 
intention of retiring. Many 
faculty members insisted the 
vote is a strong indication of 
the lack of faculty support for 
Day. However, Day main-
tained that he is being blamed 
for circumstances beyond his 
control, namely the budget 
crisis of 1992. 

UCD Debat •• Entry 
Of Transfers 
DAVIS - UC Davis admin-
istrators and faculty met 
earlier this month to discuss 
the admittance of three 
transfer students from UC 
Santa Cruz who were among 
six individuals disciplined by 
a UCSC judicial panel for 
sexual assault and 
harrassment during the 1992-
'93 academic year. Campus 
administrators did not realize 
one of the three men had 
enrolled at· UCD until 
students brought it to their 
attention. However, campus 
officials said they have no 
legal power to bar the 
students. 

Ambassador Jacobovits de 
Szeged urged NATO to exert 
stronger political and military 
force in Bosnia in a speech 
earlier this month entitled 
"Need Security? Dial 
NATO." According to de 
Szeged, the Netherlands has 
posted 3,000 troops in the 
war-tom natioo. Using the 
relative populations of the 
two nations, de Szeged 
estimated the United States 
would need to send 45,000 
troops to match the Nether-
lands' commitment.

Runoff . 
ELEcnON: Student Unity 
Coalition candidate defeats 
R.A.C.E. member de la Pefia 
by 34 votes 
By Mary Beth Sedlack 
Staff Writer 

The new A.S. vice president was elected in 
a runoff last Wednesday when John Bames, 
of the Student Unity Coalition slate. received 
181 votes to defeat his opponent, Emelyn de 
la Peila of the Revolutionary Action Chal-
lenging the Establishment (R.A.C.E.) slate, 
who accrued 147 votes . 

In the original election, Barnes received 
44.8 percent of the vote, de la Peila received 
38.9 percent and Elizabeth Pang was third 
with 16 percent. 

Since no candi<!ate had a clear majority of 
the votes. a runoff between Barnes and de la 
Peila was required. 

'" stated previously that I was going to 
rally my constituency and' am glad I was able 
to do this. I'm going to make sure the voices 
of all students are heard in the A.S .... Barnes 
said. 

As the incumbent to the position, Barnes 
said he is well aware of the problems the A.S. 
faces. 

He said his goals include teforming the 
appointment system of campus-wide com-
mittee representatives, posting A.S. docu-
ments on the Internet and Illfintaining a stu-
dent 80vernment research library. 

ThoU8h A.S. Prelident-elect Poncho 
Guevara ran on a different slate than Barnes. 
Guevara said he felt very positive about the 
prospect of workin, with Barnes.

Momentum Budget

MEDIA: A.S. says the student paper ove~pent its

EIIubeth M.ck ...... 
Staff Writer 

Charges by the A.S. Media 
Committee that Momentum news-
paper overspent its Winter Quar-
ter budget by almost S400 have 
triggered counter-charges from the 
publication's editors of personal 
bias. 

The A.S. Council 
will vote Wednesday 
on how to best re-
solve the alleged vio-
lation. 

IIIf'CC'd to the $800 budget cap and 
that it was approved by an A.S. 
Council vote. 

Tashiro denied ever fonnally 
discussing the issue. 

Tashiro argues that according 
to A.S. financial bylaws. the an-
nual budget of $3,950 approved 

by . the Media 
Committee for 
Momentum isn't 
subject to quar-
terly approvals 
and, therefore 
quarterly deficits 
are irrelevant. 

According to 
A.S. Media Com-
missioner Bik-na 
Park, the counci I will 
either reallocate 
$400 from Momen-
tum to the Media 
unallocated ac-
co unt or freeze 
Momentum's bud-
get. 

Park said that the 
money will most 
likely be reallocated. 

Momentum Edi-

that Park singled out 
the newspaper for 
budget cuts because

However, Park maintains she

committee's quarterly review of 
campus media budgets as stan-
dard practice. 

Park said that the newspaper. 
which is normally funded for two 
editions per quarter, spent S400 in 
excess of the $800 allocated for a 
single, consolidated Winter Quar-
ter issue. 

''They were very irresponsible

said of the Mo~ntum staff.

Committee's recommendations

Park dismissed Tashiro's accu-
sation, saying, "It doesn't matter 
what they write about me in their 
papers .... If it were any other pa-
per, I would do the same. 

'This isn't about censorship," 
she added. 

Tashiro said any reduction in 
Momentum's budget for Spring

tonomy as a student organiza-
tion." 

'1f they're going to cut any

any differences he had with

810: Critics seek 
proof of project t s 
safety for marine life 
ContInued from ..... 1 
claiming it could endanger marine 
wildlife. 

'The potential damages are 
poorly understood," said Kelly 
Quirke, a coordinator of 
Greenpeace's EnellY and Climate 
Campaign in San Francisco. 
"There is no consensus among 
m8rlne mamma1 scientists that this 
[project) does not hurt whales or 
any other marine mammals." 

Source transmissions are ini-
tially planned to last for 20 min-
utes at four-hour intervals. Ac-
cording to project organizers, the 
transmission rate will be reduced 
after the first few months. 

Scientists involved in the ini-
tiative chose a sound frequency 
between 6O-90Hz because data 
on · the hearing sensitivities of 
toothed whales, ~eals, and sea 
lions suggest that frequencies be-
low approximately 100Hz are 
practically inaudible to these 
mammals. 

In addition, scientists said the 
sound transmissions would not 
interfere with mammal vocaliza-
tions. 

Munk, in response to claims 
made by environmental groups that 
the transmissions will damage 
marine wildlife said, "I think [the 
claims] are totally without merit." 

Munk added that the 195 deci-
bel transmissions will be datnp-
ened a million-fold when pr0pa-
gated underwater as opposed to in 

the air. 
Quirke disagreed, however, 

saying, ''There is not a lot of study 
on how loud noises affect marine 
mammals, especially those that 
echo-locate, like whales do." 

Quirke also pointed out that the 
sound transmissions, even at a 
depth of 800 meters, could ad-
versely affect elephant seals which 
often dive to enormous depths for 
long periods of time. 

"Until there is proof that there 
are no adverse effects, you must 
apply the 'Precautionary Prin-
ciple, '" an environmental creed 
which states that if one cannot 
prove that something will not do 
any harm. then it should not be 
done, said Quirke. 

"Unfortunately [the principle] 
is something we've gotten away 
from in this country," Quirke 
added. 

The A TOC program is devot-
ing about $3 million to extensive 
field studies aimed at examining 
any unforeseen effects that the . 
sounds generated by the ATOC 
project may have on marine wild-
life. 

Munk said that over the last 
two years, researchers in Kauai 
have studied the behavioral pat-
terns of submerged and surface 
marine mammals. 

He added that, "We have gone 
by the most responsible way," 
offering SIO marine biologists the 

"rotocol to modify or stop the 
transmissions. 

SIO has received $35 mi\lion 
for the project from the congres-
sionally-mandated Strategic En-
vironmental Research and Devel-

The UCSD Cuardiaa 

opment Program (SERDP), an or-
glnization responsible for fund-
in. the development of new envi-
ronmental technologies, large-
scale environmental monitoring, 
and pollution mitigation. 

SIO scientists assert that acous-
tic techniques provide rapid and 
large-scale temperature averages 
required for understanding and 
predicting global climate change 
and its relationship to greenhouse 
gases in the atmosphere. 

"While we do need continuing 
scientific study to tell us about 
global warming," Quirke said, 
"what we need more is action." He 
added that federal money would 
be better spent in clean energy 
technologies such u wind and 
solar farms. 

"'The transition to clean energy 
will be the- only thing that can 
forestall climate change from hap-
pening," said Quirke. 

The National Marine Fisheries 
Service (NMFS), the body respon-
sible for giving the permit for the 
ATOC initiative, held meetings in 
Hawaii last Thursday and Friday. 

The NMFS decided it was nec-
essary to draft an Environmental 
Impact Statement (EIS) for project 
approval. Completion of the state-
ment is expected to take about 60 
days. 

"When you ask for a permit," 
said Munk, "you're asking for a 
pennit to take. Take means any-
thing from kill to affecting behav-
ioral patterns in any observable 
way." 

Munk asserted that the claim 
that tens of thousands of whales

4 OPINION The UCSD CuanIiaa Moadey, April 18, 19M 

PINION 
By Doug Alexander, Opinion Editor 

The continuance of high teen pregnancy rates can be traced to poor sex education, lack of available coruraception and parerual consent laws 

U hildrenhavingchildren. Babies having babies. Such catch· phrases are commonly invoked 
whenever the issue of sex and 

teenagers ronverge. And as the language sug· 
gests, Americans are less-than-approvingofleen. 
agers having sex - much less having kids. 

It's almost become an unquestionable truth 
that pregnancy among teens is out of control. 
Sex-crazed, baby-booming kids, weare told, are 
one of America's number-one problems. This 
crisis is associated with a mind·numbing array 
of pathologies: poverty, crime, violence, drug 
abuse - essentially everything bad and ugly in 
modem America. In the last decade, this has 
moved parents, politicians and religious leaders 
to wage a war against teen sex - and sexuality. 

But the facts belie the hype. Despite the noise 
and moralizing, teen pregnancy is hardly at an all· 
time high. In fact, pregnancy rates among teenag· 
ers are lower today than they were in 1958 (6.2 
percent in 1991 compand to 9.2 pen:ent in 1958). 
Pregnancy rates among teens have remained rela-
tive! y stable. In addition, two-thirds of these preg. 
nant teens are 18-and 19·year-old women, and 71 
percent of these "teenage" pregnancies were the 
result of sex with men over the age of 2n. 

As forout-of·wedlock births among teens~ 
what some consider the "smoking gun" in 'JIOV. 
erty and social decay - these rates have risen 
relatively gradually over the last 30 yean (1.5 
percent in 1958 compared to 4.S percent in 

. 1992.) While these rates are nothing 10 swft'at, 
they've certainly been overblown by politic:ianl 
and the media. And while teen pregnancy is 
dearly a problem, public raponIC hal been 
II1IR punitive than helpful. 

What is molt Ibiki .. about America'a re-
... 10 .... and ..... ...-.cy it ill 

emphasis on morality and its assump~ion that 
young people are unable to make their own 
choices rP.garding sex and sexuality . Indeed, it's 
often denied that young people have the riglu to 
make thesechoices- that's the duty of parents, 
politicians, religioua leaders and school admin-
istrators. The most radical indication of this is 
the nationwide growth of abstinence-only sex· 
education programL 

"Just say no" sex..ecfucation programs got 
much of their impetus from "Dlddy" McReagan 
in 1981. At the tune of S40 miHion a year, the 
Reagan·initiated"OI8Stity BiU"(a.k.a. The Ado-
lacent Family Life Act) gave the Feds a new 
mandate to develop and maintain school pr0-
grams encouraging teens to abstain from sex 
until marriage. Of these programs, the most 
notorious are Teen·Aid and Sex Respect, both 
of which are explicidy based on VfII'J IelipJus, 
very 0IriIIian, valuea. 

following on the heels of San MmxlI and 
Escondido, Vista Unified School DiIIrict re-
cently approved "Sex Respect," a blatandy Idi· 
gioua, Ibstinence-only "sex ed" propMl. Sa 
Respect not only preaches that pre martial_ 
and abortion are evils (e.g. "TakcGod aJoaaon 
your date"), it promotes lies and disIortioas 
about sex and sexuality - IS illustrated by the 
Sex Respect claim that "A condom won't pre. 
vent AIDS, it will only delay it "It'. no surpriIe 
that the program has faced several constitutional 
challengea and is strongly opposed by the vat 
majority of educators.

ICxuaiity can be seen at varying degrees in most 
sex-education courses throughout the United 
Slates. 

While four·fiftlui of the slates either require 
or encourage schools to teach sex education, the 
breadth and quality of such programs is ex· 
tremely spotty. According to the Alan

COMMENTARY: With its emphasis on ideas rather than history, Revelle Humanities faUs short of the mark 

By D ...... HdIe 
Sta" Writer 

As an inter~Uege transfer stu· 
dent, I've had the opportunity to 
sample both Revelle College's Hu· 
manitiessequence and F'dlhCoIlege'. 
Making of the Modern World. Al-
though I enjoyed both, f ultimately 
believe that MMW is a better program 
- or at least, a more useful and ben· 
eflcial one. 

Ironically, one of the main factors 
in my decision to cOrne to UCSD was 
Revelle's Humanities sequence. I had 
long wanted to take such a "Great 
Books" course of Western Civiliza· 
tion. I'd finaDy be learning all the 
great ideas, reading Plato, Aristotle, 
Rousseau, Hobbes, Nietzsche and all 
the rest. I figured I'd be a much more 
informed and well· rounded when I 
finished. After all, as the college cata· 
Iogsaid, I wasgoing to be "confronted 
with significant humanistic issues in 
the context of a rigorous course servo 
ing as an introduction to the academic 
disciplines of history, literature and 
philosophy." 

I must aay that I Rally did enjoy 
Iaki .. Humanities 1 and 2. PIofesIIor 
Friedmaa, who taugbt the Old Testa· 
menI portioa of HumaaitieI 1, \VII 
especially pel. My HumaniIies 2 
c:1au, taujbt by Profeslor Alden 
MoMhammer,inwhic:bwe..tVUJil, 
the New Teartamem, Dante and Au-
gustine, also taught me JIaI deal. 

But IOIIIdbin& WII JDiIIriaa. There 
wasn't anything leally holding the 
courses 1qIeCher. It aeemed like we 
weregettingone"GratBoolt"or"great 
idea" after another with no context or 

framowort in whic:h to pul them. And 
when we did get lOIIIe history - for 
example, Friedman's explanation of 
how the Bible evolved from various 
different writen and stories - I was 
still in the dark. We seemed to focus on 
the Old Testament itself, rather than on 
the actuaJ history of the Jewish people 
and society of whic:h the Bible was a 
produc:t. Who were these Assyrians? 
How and when did they, and then the 
Egyptians and the Babylonians, c0n-
quer the Jewish kingdoms? How and. 
when were Jews exiled and split up by 
these Empires? Who were the Jews' 
contemporaries in the res! of the world? 
And so on. 

My experience with Humanities 2 
was similar. We plunged deep into 
Virgil, the New Teslament, Dante and 
Augustine. Yet by the end of the 
course, I had almost no understanding 
of what the Roman Empire was, let 
alone why it fell. I found myself rum· 
maging through encyclopedias and 
history books in vain to try to fdl in the 
gaps. 

Then I transfared to Fifth College 
and enrolled ia the Making of the 
Modem World sequence (MMW), 
IIkina c:oune.o 4, S and 6. Inatead of 
practic:aJly iporing history or beat· 
ing it periphenIIy, history was at the 
heart of theleqUCDCO.lII fact, MMW 
could be ..... worId history course 
in six parts. 

The ceatraJ text that tied the lie-
quonce togetbor (Greaves' Civi/izQ· 
tiotu of IN WtJrld) was, in fact; a 
history. book. 1bIf'. not to .. y that 
MMW ijnored the c:lusics. We stiD 
read Rousseau, Marx, Voltaire and 

the like, but now they were related to 
the society and politics of the era. The 
"great ideas" were studied not only 
for their own sake, but as a reflection 
of historical conditions and trends. 

I have heard some criticize MMW 
for being too "politically a>I'Rcl" and 
jumping on the multicultural band· 
wagon. This is an unfair charge. In 
fact, MMW is very Eurocentric, espe-
c:ially the last half of the sequence. But 
this should be expected. After 1 SOO 
AD., Europe began to dominate the 
world stage, and thus world history. 
MMW reflects this by emphasizing 
Western Europe. However, before 
1500, Europe was not especially sig-
nificant on the world sc:aIe. The Chi-
nese, Ottoman and Indian (MugbaI) 
empires were IIIOIe popuJous and ad-
vanced than WCIlenI Europe and they 
affeded Emope II1IR than Europe at· 
fecIed them. It's only IIIhnI that the 
fust few MMW counes devote a reJa. 
tively larger amount of time to those 
c:iviJ~ (and odren) than to Eu-
rope. 

'This is not 10 say that MMW is 
perfect. My experiences (1992·93) in 

MMWSand6withProfessorsGershon 
Sbafir and Miles Kahler, respectively, 
were especially gonel. But I felt that 
MMW 4, taught by Professor Edward 
Reynolds, which covered colonialism 
and the slave trade, did not spend quite 
enough time on the events unfolding 
within Europe. We spent so much time 
focusing on the effects of Europe's 
conquests, such as the horrible suffer· 
ing of the victims of social upheavals 
caused by colonization and the slave 
trade, that we ignored the causes (the 
social, economic and political fon:es 
in Europe) that led to them in the first 
place. But then, I guess, one can 't 
cover everything. 

Ultimately, I got more out of 
MMWtbantheHumanitiessequence. 
Perhips my criticism of Revelle's Hu· 
manities is unfair. Although I believe 
it would benefit from emphasizing 
historical aspects a bit more, the Hu· 
manities sequence is not a history 
course and doesn't pretend to be. Ac· 
cording to the course catalog. it only 
promises to "expose [students] to a 
variety of ideas. .. that have exerted a 
major influence on Western Odture. " 
And this it does. I can aJso testify that 
it Mprovides training and practice in 
penuasion through written expres-
sion, " • advatised. 

However, MMW (whic:h is bui-
cally a world history course smartly 
spruced up with the addition of a bit of 
the humanities) is a much more reI-
evlllt and useful program. Sure, hav· 
inga knowledge of the grat ideas and 
philosophy of the Western world is 
important, but how useful are they if 
you don't even have a basic under· 

standingoftheglobalhistoryofwhich 
they are a product? 

And how is one to make any sense 
out of today's world events such as 
the current war in Bosnia, thecontlict 
between the Muslim Shiite and Sunni 
sects or the rise of, and cu rrent eco· 
nomic conflict with, Japan without 
havinga basic understanding of their 
historical roots? Given the impor· 
tance of a basic knowledge of world 
history, the fact that MMW is such a 
unique program is a bit dishearten· 
ing. A quick look at the UCSD His· 
tory Department's offerings shows 
that taking MMW is the only way 
anyone besides a history major can 
get a basic knowledge of world his· 
tory. There are no other comprehen· 
sive history coursesorsequences that 
cover such a broad range of subjects. 
Even history majors generally aren't 
exposed to the world as a whole; 
instead, they specialize in a specific 
region. 

This is unfortunate. It seems like a 
typical university graduate'S knowl· 
edge of world history is limited to 
little more than what he picked up in 
his junior ,high school "World His-
tory" clus - unless, of course, he is 
a Fifth College graduate. 

The designers of Fifth's MMW 
program should be commended. 
They've done an excellent job at pro-
viding a oourse that gives a basic 
understanding of the historical, s0-
cial, economic and political forces 
that have gone info the Mmaking of the 
modem world." Their MMW se· 
quence should serve as a model for 
other colleges and universities.

V ANDAIJISM OF cIIE MURAL IS A HATE CRIME 
Edtor: 

On Wednesday night, April 13, 
the Council of the AsIociIted Stu-
dents agreed upon the implementa-
tionof a resolution that denounces the 
defacement of the Ole Caf6 mural. 
The AS. Council views the destruc-
tionofthe mural and in the manner in 
which it was vandalized as a blatant 
hate aime. The etJedsof such aimes 
Ire herein recognized IS harmful to 
the environment that we as a council 
hope 10 create. The vandalism of the 
0!6 Cafe must be viewed by the stu-
dents of UCSD as a sign of inaeased 
racism on ibis campus. The AS.Coun-
cil strongt y denounces this and all 
other forms of racism. The oouncil 
hopes that every member of the 
ASUCSD (all students) unite against 
all forms of racism and prejudice and 
strive to create • more harmonious, 
culturally-diverse campus.

I was appalled aad hurt by the 
defacement of the 016 Caf~ mural. It 
is unfortunate that it taltessuch shoc:k-
ing events to stir any emotion and 
awareness on this campus. Even If-
tertheseatrociousevents,theGUIIJ"d-
ian, exemplifying the apathy on this 
campus, did not report it for an entire 
week. As a person of Jewish descent, 
but more importantly asa member of 
the campus oommunity, I strongly 
denounce all forms of bate crimes 
and/or vandalism on this campus. It 
is time for the students at large, and 
the AS. IS their representatives, to 
address these issues and actively try 
to combat attitudes and ideas that 
lead to or allow these horrific events 
to occur.

EdItor: 

Last week people worldwide 
I1IOUI'Dcd the six million Jews annihi-
lated in the Holocaust, vowing never 
to forpt the atrocities committed by 
the Nazis. Yet 80IIICI UCSD students, 
through their actions, demoIIItrate that 
they have already forgocten that anti-
Semitism is still prevalent and grow-
ing. 

The recent swastiltu and "white-
power" slopn spray-painted on the 
Ole Caf6 are I painful reminder of 
Hitler's agenda to rid the worid of 
Jews. Even more disheartening is the 
fact that a group of students at UCSD 
have nt.gIected the original meaning 
behind the swutib symbol.

A former Ch6 Caf~ volunteer is 
wanted for questioning by police 
after a man closely matching his 
description was profiled on the 
television show "America's Most 
Wanted." 

The volunteer seemed to re-
semble Mark Mallet. a California 
native who is under investigation 
for the 1987 murder of his busi-
ness partner's son in Hilo, Hawaii. 
Mallet has been on the run for the 
past seven years . 

UCSD Police, acting on a tip 
shortly after the show aired in early 
March, questioned the volunteer

Former A.S. Vice President 
Administrative Randolph 
SiwabCsay, who will be the offi-
cial ~pokcsman for Hancock at the 
hearing of the case, said the moti-
vation for filing the charges was 
based on a need to re-examine the 
rules with respect to the produc-
tion and posting of the SAAC fli-

at the 06 Caf6.

to the 06, Jackson was gone. 

According to UCSD Police 
Detective Nate Floyd, Jackson re-
sembled the fugitive from Hawaii, 
but the identification was not con-
fmned. "We don't know one way 
or another," he said. 

According to "America's Most 
Wanted," Mallet had webbed toes. 
Police had checked other aspects

while in office two years ago. 

"I've known [Craig 'and

volved in itudcnt government and 
I don 't haveanythinl against them, 
but there have been many ques-
tions brought up concerning these 
flien and we want clarification," 
Siwabcssy said. 

Guevara and other candidates 
from his slate, Revolutionary Ac-
tion Challenging the Establish-
ment (R.A.C.E.), were also en-
dorsed in the SAAC fliers. 

- R.A.C.E. membcn agreed to count 
the flien against their campaign

fore the A.S. Elections Board two 
weeks ago.

if Jackson's toes were webbed. 

Muir College senior Pia 
Guerrero knew Jackson during the 
nine months that he was at UCSD. 
She confirmed that Jackson had 
webbed toes. 

"He was a very nice guy, seem· 
ingly very sane, very helpful and 
positive," she said. 

UCSD Police contacted the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation 
but have had no further leads on 
the case. 

Hoyd added that despite the 
similarities between Mallet and 
Jackson, misidentifications are fre·

"U these fliers were posted ille-

have they affected the results of

Siwabessy said. "Let's just settle 
these questions and let the higher 
judgment pass a decision down."

SPORTS: UCSD's intramural sports program, considered among the best collegiate programs nationwide, 
attracts students from all areas of campus with an interest in teamwork, competition and fun 

By MIchMI8 ...... n Sf"" Writer 
.s INI'BROOUJ!OIA11! A11IlEnC PRooRAMS 
go, UCSD's is not generally consid· 
ered among the very best. Altbough 
our intercollegiate teams are bighly 
competitive within tbeir division, tbe 
NCAA Division III, UCSD is widely 

known in tbe UC system as a school wbich 
stresses academics over athletics. The lack 
of sports funding coupled witb lagging stu-
dent spirit for university teams reinforces 
the common belief that atbletics have much 
less of an impact here than at other DivisiQn 
I schools, such IS UCLA and UC Berkeley, 

In contrast, the UCSD Intramural (1M) 
Recrestional Sports Program is one of the 
top programs in the nation, according to 
Intramural Assistant Director Matt Adams, 
who travels to various national and regional 
university intramurai conferences, ' ''I 
haven ' t heard of anybody that's doing a 
better job than we are," Adams said. 

One of the most efficiently-run colle-
giate programs, UCSD's 1M sports have 
thrived for tbe last 15 years. Last year, 
UCSD fielded a total of 1,672 intramural 
teams in nine different sports. Although it is 
difficult to estimate the number of students 
involved because many team members play 
more than one sport, 1M Director Mike 
Hipp estimated that well over 50 percent of 
tbe student body participates in IMs, 
..... .e ...... 

The latest burdle challenging the Intra-
mural program is ' increasing budget cuts, 
Last year, financial support was cut by 33 
percent, forcing students to pay an addi-
tional team fee of $2.5 for most sports. The 
team fee allowed the program to continue 
offering a variety of sports, ranging from 
badminton to innertube water polo. 

"We wanted to keep the quality of tbe 
program that UCSD has become accus-
tomed to," Hipp said, 

Although the fee is minimal, averaging 
$2.50 per pllyer for a team of 10, it adds yet 
anotber colt to the ltudent participants' 
expenses for playing in the informal leagues, 
According 'to Sports Assistant and recent 
UCSD graduate Erik Jobnson, tbough, 
intramurals are still mucb better than many 
other typea of recreational sports leagues 

avail~le to students. 
"[Paying the team fee] is really nothing 

compared to city recreation or summer 
leagues," Johnson said. "We're trying not 
to cut down the breadtb of tbe program," 

IS a baketball referee, said that her job 
provides a welcome change of piICe from 
academics. "I always look forward to going 
to the games, It's a fun atmosphere a 
break from studying," Mease said. 

Job...,D, who baa played for botb 1M 
teams and the intercollegiate basketball 
team, said he believes a major reuon for the 
large number of students wbo play 
intramurals is that the sports provide a bal-
ance between rigorous academic schedules 
and recreational activities. 

"It's fun -a chance to ptout and work 
Altbough participa-

tion bas not declined in 
most sports since tbe fee 
was implemented tbis fall, 
some women's sports 
have dwindled, such IS 
volleybaJl, basketballanet 
floor bockey-women's 
football h .. disappeared 
entirely. Considering tbe 
steps the program bas 
tsken in the past to en-
courage women's partici-
pation in 1M sports, Hipp

out the frustrations during 
the w..," he said, adding 
that the size of the univer-
sity attracts a lot of tal-
ented atbletes. "When you 
have a school of lS,OOO 
kids, you're going to have 
good athletes tbat aren't 
all wearing uniforma," he 
said,

Mease, who also plays 
on tbe women's intercol-
legiate basketball team, 
said intramural sports pro-
vide an excellent oppor-

_ Matt ~ tunity for students to par-
said he feels hig~er fees pIIIJ.' 
are not helping. 

"Here we are trying to 
promote women's partici-

Intramural Aaslst8nt DInIctor ticipate on sports teams, 

pation in sports, and now we're putting 
barriers in the way," he said. 

Next year, the program will face even 
more difficulties wben the present UIOCi· 
ate director, Scott Bemdes, moves to a 
position in the Recreation Department, 
"We're hopingitwon'timpact ulotoomucb, 
but it' s 60 to 70 hours I week of work that 
we're losing," said Adams, who wiu be· 
rome associate director upon Bemdes' de-
parture. 

Besides the three executive positions in 
tlie 1M program, most of the work il done by 
sports supervisors (SAs) and officials, all of 
whom are students, Eighty-five percent of 
the money allocated to tbe program goes 
directly to the salaries of SAl and ltudent 
officials. "JI's great when you can give the 
money back 10 tbe students and have a good 
program that the student body can enjoy," 
said Hipp. The program is oriented toward 
student leadersbip, training its officiall in 
clinics offered every quarter, 

WIIJ~"b_"" 
Marshall junior Sara Mease, wbo works 

"Not everybody can 
compete at the intercollegiate level, and 
IMs give those people who are looking for 
all thejoysofsports--competitivencsa, fun, 
teamwork and sportsmanship-a chanc:e to 
participate," Meaie aid, 

Intramurals give people a chance to play 
organized sports with tbeir frieads in a 
recreational environment which diffen sig-
nificantly from tbC pressure of intercol-
legiate sports. IMI a110 require a small 
investment of time, energy and dedication 
when' compared witb tbe rigorous sched-
ules of intercollegiate teams. By playing 
onc:e a week, there is leu stress and pressure 
on a player; many teaml play just for enjoy-
ment. 

The' games do, however, get quite com-
petitive at times, especially in tbe AAA 
divilion;-according to Mease, "Some of the 
men's [basketball] teams get really com-
petitive because lOme of the players are red 
sbirts on the intercollegiate team and there's 
a bit of rivalry between them," sbe said. 1M 
teams are allowed a maximum of one inter· 
collegiate player per team to prevent the 
creation of teams consisting solely of more 

experienced players. 
....,..._C.I' • 

UCSO's expansive campus and spread-
out college format makes large-scale inter-
.aion between Itudent IfOUPI raR, Adams 
said that a major pi of the 1M program is 
to give people a cbance to en. tbese bani-
en by uniting students from all area of 
campus. 

"Ibis campus is devoid of a lot of unify-
ingactivities, IMscut across all tbecampus 
lines. We offer a myriad of sports and a 
variety of different levels to play," be aid, 
"Our goal is to reach out to tbe entire cam-
pus community with a diverse program that 
anyone can get involved in." 

In contrast, UCSD student spectator at-
tendance at intercollegiate sports events is 
very low, Forexample, this &eaSOn's men's 
baketball playoffa attracted tbe greatest 
crowd of the year,lbout l,soopcople, which 
is a Imall fraction of the students attending 
UCSD, 

According to Adams, television cover-
age of big-name schools is partially respon-
sible for the lack of student IUpport, "TV 
puts so much emphasis on the big teams 
around tbe country," he said, "It's unfair 
because [UCSD] b .. a quality program," 

The Triton Athletic Council (TAC), 
whicb is made up of representatives from 
eacb intercollegiate team, is making an ef-
fort to involve tbe campus more in intercol-
legiate sports. Last quarter T AC organized 
two receptions at the basketball games in 
wbich each member invited a professor, 
hoping to draw IUpport from the faculty. 

Whatever problema the intercollegiate 
program appears to bave in gaining a large 
fan base, the intramural program continues 
to make up the difference by providing 
sports events to UCSD students, partici-
puts and fans alike, Next year, with tbe 
completion of the Recreationalllntramura\ 
Athletic and Events Center (RIMAe), an 
ample supply of athletic space could make 
expenaion of tbe program possible, if tbe 
budget allows. .

Grade Release 
Forms 

In an l\\emptlo restructure the grade 
release forms for fraternilies and 
sororities and protect the privacy of 
individuals. IFC and Panbellenic are 
working with the Registrar's office 
Iowards a new system 10 monilor 
grades. 1be new system would be 
compatible with the Registrar's data 
base. Cbapler member names and 
student ID numbers would be provided 
electronically inhancing accuracy, 
speed, and privacy. 

At present the release of grades is 
problemalic. Members of fraternities 
and sororities sign grade release forms 
in order for chapters to verify their 
rosters for eligibility in sports and Greek 
events and update their rosters with 
new members and transfers. The 
bottom portion of the forms satisfies 
the Registrar's requirements 10 release 
grades, while the top ponion provides 
IFC and Pan hellenic general 
information such as addresses, 
academic standing, and pledge class. 
For IFC and Panhellenic, this aids in 
mailing lists and signing sponsors. 

While this system IerYCS the purpose 
of releasing grades for IFC, 
Panhellenic, and chapters, the method 
employed draws criticism from 
member Greeu. The problem il that 
insIeadofprovidingonlygrades,which 
il the one thing used by IFC and 
Panhellenic, the Registrar lends full 

~conomics mljor. Chapman is a 
member of Siama Phi Epsilon. 

Despite being involved in their 
fraternities, . MiII~r, Shim, Chapman, 
and Szymanowski were able to 
represent the UCSD swim team at 
NationaJsu well as proving themaelves 
u students, leaders. and u Sbim 
commented, "good frieoda that will 
always keep in Iouch." 

Sports Corner 
The Spring spons season started 

quickly for the UCSD's sororities. 
While the lun wu shining outaide, the 
women headed indoors to compete in 
the ISS BultetbaJl tournament. The 
tournament WII fill plc~d and 
.howcaaed numerous competitive 
pmos, but in the end it turned out to be 
tho Kappa Kappa Gamm. Show. 

Kappa showed that they were a 
force to bedellt with when they IOIIIIdly 
defeated Chi Omega in the lCmifinaJs 
with 'licellent outside shooting and 
teaacious clefeDIC. The Kappa's met 
Delta Gamma in the fmals and again 
proved that they wen the team to beat 
ia tile eoum-at. After forty minutes, 
ICappIICIppI Gamma bad \be victory

transcripts, then chapter GPA's mUit 
be computed manually. 

(Fe and Panhellenic are working 
toward a new system that would receive 
only chapter GPA'sand not additional 
individual information that full 
transcripts provide. By using a 
computer database compatible with the 
Registrar's system, IFC, Panhellenic, 
and chapters will be able to work more 
effectively to continue to pursue high 
standards of scholarship among its 
members. 

Aside from eliminating the release 
of personal information other than the 
student's grade point average, the goal 
of the new system would also increase 
the accuracy of figures in computing 
chapter GPA's and overall Greek GPA. 
In addition, it would allow for a much 
easier response to requests from 
National headquaners of fraternities 
and sororities without having 10 sift 
through any additional information. 

Through the new system. IFC and 
Panhellenic hope to alleviate the 
controversy surrounding the grade 
release forms expressed by member 
Greeu andc:oocentrateon maintaining 
overall scholastic performance within 
the Greek system u well uestablishing 
improvement prosnms. UCSD Greek 
GPAs have traditionally been higher 
than the all-campus average. This 
system will belp verify our success.

ARCHI: Padres 
are baseball mockery 
ContInued ........... 20 
theme this year is "Hey, it's Base-
baU," although you couldn't teU by 
the way the Padres play the game. 
Tbe commercials feature two 
knucklebeads litting in the cheap 
seall at Jack Murphy Stadium talk-
ing about how anything can happen 
in baseball whetber it'l Dante 
Bicbette having an all-star year or a 
team featuring the likes of Rickey 
Gutierrez, An:hi Cianfroc:co and 
Wally Whitebunt winning a cham-
pionship. . 

The logic behind Ibis idea, like 
mosI of the idea thai the Padres 
come up with, is, of course, absurd. 

"Hey," Padres management is 
saying to the fana, "we know we 
traded away all our good ballplayers. 
We know that we're fielding a g1o-
rifiedTriple-Asquad. We know tbat 
our manager is named Riggleman 
and that our mascot is a horrible 
freak of nature. But it's baseball-
anything could happen. We might 
win a championship. But don't bet 
on it And even if we don't win, you 
can spend hours of enjoyment figur-
ing out how to pronounce 
'Cianfrocco. '" 

This certainly isn't the dumbest 
marketing campaign a major league 
ballclub hu ever thoughl up. Back 
when the San Francisco Gianta were 
losing 90 games a season with guys 
like Johnny leMaster, Greg Minton 
and Gary laVelle laking the field, 
the GianlS' management came up 
with a fiendishly clever marketing 
scheme. 

"Our ballpark lUCks!" they said 
in commercial after commercial. 
"Night games are cold and miser-
able! After the third iaoiD& you're 
likely to be savagely beaten by the 
other fans! Our team is pathetic! 
Our hot dogs are soggy! But why 
don't you come out anyhow? 
Please?" 

Needless to say, the Giants' slo-
gan really didn't catch on with the 
fans, most of whom were too busy 
fighting off hypothermia, savagely 
beating the guy sitting in front of 
them or yellingobsc:enitiesatJohnny 
LeMasler. At least the Padres 
haven't brougbt up their soggy hot 
dogs. 

Admitting that tbe team is a 
mockery of a ballclub is certainly 
honest of Tom Wernerand the other 
Padres owneJS, but it sure won't 
inspire the masses to tum out in 
droves to see if Bip Roberts can get 
over the Mendozza line. 

Why not just usc the 11ogan, "Bet-
ter come out to watch the team be-
fore we up and move to Tampa 
Bay?" It's just as honest, and prob-
ably a better indicator of the Padres' 
immediate future.

But accord-

ing to women'l Head Coach Jack 
VaDerp. UCSD i. quickly closing 
the gap. 

USD covered the relatively short 
l,500-meter coune in a winning 
time of 5:07.02, barely edging the 
Triton crew'. 5:08.4 for San Diego 
braggina rilhll. 

'"The USD boat beat \II by eight 
seconds [at the San Diego Crew 
Cluaic'. Cal Cup race]," Vallerga 
Aid. ·We have chopped that gap 
down considerably." 

Vallerpcreclillbiacrew'.much-
improved Itart for the lessened time 
differential. 

"Imagine a track sprinter com-
inloffthe blocu 011 a balance beam. 
That's what it illike OD the starting 
line in a crew race," Vallerga Aid. 

"You have to go from a stand-
still up to racing lpeed fast but in a 

balanced fashion. Everyone bas 'to 
row to within what the crew is ca-
pable of, and your partners have to 
reply in balance," he added. "Our 
starts have not been fast all year, but 
we looked pretty good in this one. " 

The Tritons blew USD away over 
the first 250 meters, but the Toreros 
stormed back to take almost a half-
a-boat-Iength lead at the I,OOO-meter 
marker. 

UCSD answered with a sprint-
ing spurt of ilS own over the last 500 
meters, but fell 1.4 seconds short of 
the victory. 

"All in all it was a pretty encour-
aging race," VaHerga said. "We 
know technically what we need to 
work on. We have a great sprint and 
we added a promising start, so there 
is no' reason to think that the middle 
part won't come around." 

Vallerga'swomen'sllOviceeight 
crew captured ilS first win of the 
aeuon in a dramatic come-from-
behind finalSOO-meter flurry. 

The UCSD "A" team (5:28.04) 
crossed the line a scant .48 secondl 
in front of USD (5:28.52). The Tri-

5:54.3.

On the flip side, the Triton men 
chalked up two second-place per-
formances in tbe varsity eight and 
novice events. 

USD again mastered the field, 
winning the varsity outing in4: 18.1. 
UCSD nabbed the silver in 4:23.3 
and San Diego State University, the 
Crew Classic's Cal Cup OIampion, 
cruised in a distant third-place time 
of 4:2.5.8. 

"I was very disappointed with 
the information put out about this 
weekend's race," mea'i Head Coach 
Do"lThiemannAid. "We were told 
that it would be aI, 750-meter con-
test and it turned out to be much less 
than what we had prepared for." 

"That'l not to take anything away 
from USD," he addod. "We have 
our sprint back 10 I am looking 
forward to seeing what we can do in 
the coming weeks.· 

SDSU captured the men'l nov-
ice event (4:38.0), out-diatancing 
both UCSD (4:40.9) and USD 
(4:45.4). 

"That is probably the order that 
we would have predicted going into 
the race. From places one to Ihree, 
that wu the closest race of the day," 
Thiemaan said. 

"Overall, USD bad a great race 
and we had a pretty good one," 
Thiemann said. "San Diego State 
has had its lurn at the Crew Classic 
and now so has USD, I think we are 
due."

It was the University of La

UCSD on Bubble 
TROUBLED: Late-season Triton slump may cost UCSD 
its ninth-consecutive NCAA Division III National berth 
By M ..... MoortIIy 
Staff Writer 

When Washington" Lee (VA) 
visited the North Campus Courts 
last Thursday, the UCSD men"ten· 

nis team knew 
it could easily' 
end its five-
game losing 
streak, and the 
7-2 win 
aglinst the 
Generals did 
just that. But 
the test of the 
Tritons' post· 
season fitness 
came on Sun-
day afternoon 
when they 

battled Pomona-Pitzer, They just 
missed a passing grade,dropping the 
heartbreaker, S-4. The Tritons (8-8) 
are now in jeopardy of missing na-
tionals forthe first time in nine years. 

The loss could be just enough to 
push them out of the NCAAs. "It'll 
be a pure committee thing now," 
mused Coach Tim Ditzler, hopeful 
that his team's early-season win-
ning streak and near-miss losses will 
be enough to qualify for nationals. 

Ditzler said he wu pleased last 
Thursday after witnessing an effi-
cient win from a team desperate for 
a victory. The doubles squads came 
up big, sweeping the Generals with-
out giving up a set. 

The win appeared to give the 
Tritons some much-needed momen-

tum going into Sunday's showdown. 
Three three·set losses in singles 

plly against the Sagehens looked to 
be devastating, but Rob Ho's amaz· 
ing 1-6, 6-1, 7-6 victory It number-

Rob Ho·~ Pomone. 

four singles tied the score at 3-3. 
The Tritons needed to win two of 
the three doubles matches to clinch 
the win. 

Roy Gessford and Ho continued 
their domination at the number·two 
doubles spot, ringing up aquick 6-2, 
6·1 win. 

But John Cross and Vern Yarnell 
lost 6-4, 3-6. 6-3 at number-one 
doubles, while a first·set tie-breaker 
sapped Dan Brounstein and Anand 
Shah's strength and they fell 7-6 (7-
3), 6-3 in the number-three spot. 

There might still be hope for the 
fifth-place Tritons, however. Forthe 
last two years, five teams from the 
west have been accepted to nation-
als. This year will have to be no 
different if UCSD hopes to earn a 
post-season berth.

One week it's nining in cold sheets and the next it's 
a scene from Towering Inferno. The weather couldn't 
be any more unpleasant for the UCSD track and field 

piIIlP!III~~" team. 
The Tritons muched north to 

Claremont last Friday for the 
Pomona-Pitzer Invitational, where 
they were rudely greeted by a wall 
of hot smog. 

"Some of us bad trouble with 
the heat," Michaela Monahan said. 
"Dehydration was a problem." 

Despite tbe extreme conditions, 
UCSD again garnered several 
awards in a strong field which in-
cluded intemationalathletes. 

Freshman phenom and local 
Onnge Glen High graduate Lisa Shepard posted auto-
matic NCAA-qualifying marks in both the triple jump 
(37'7.75") and the lOO-meter hurdles (15.01). 

Shepard not only beat her personal record in the 
triple jump by over a foot, but also rewrote the Triton 
record books in both events. 

In another highlight for the women's side. sopho-
more Tan Monaghan flung the discus (109'9,,) Ind 
hurled the hammer In incredible 140'3" to improve 
upon her NCAA mark and further extend her school 
record. 

Marc Sleenhof excelled in the javelin (182'7") and 
Alan Grant led the wly for the UCSD runners, winning 
his heat in the 400 metera with I time of .50.47. He wu 
followed by teammate F.rneIt auk (49.94). 

The Tritons allO chalked up exceptional perfor-
mances in the 1.500 metera. Mike Riley (4:16.17) 
aaped ahead of Orea Kopt (4:19.14) ucI Mart 
"Ladka" Varpa (4:21.32).

Tritons RouDd Out '94 Season 
IN CLOSING: UCSD drops its final two matches of th~ year to nation's number-two Stanford and Pacific 

LOS ANGELES - You 
can tell it's still early in the 
baseball season. Dante Bichette 
of the Colorado Rockies is the 
best hitter in baseball right 
now. Journeyman Stan Javier is 
batting .426. 

The top home run hitters in 
the National League are 
Bichette, Jeff Kent of the New 
York Mets and the Florida 
Marlins' Jeff Conine - three 
players who stm have to show 
some form of ID to be allowed 
in the clubhouse. 

Now normally, these are not 
the signs of a just and ordered 
universe. When Dante Bichette 
is hitting at a .487 clip, it won't 
be long before unruly mobs run 
wild in the streets and the seas 
tum to blood. I believe it is 
actually foretold in the book of 
Revelations: "And the 
beast master shall reveal 
himself on that day when Jeff 
Kent hits five dingers." 

But we don 't have to panic, 
not just yet anyhow. Early-
season aberrations are par for 
the course in April - which 
explains what the Oakland 
Athletics and California Angels 
are doing at the top of the AL 
Western Division. 

By late May, sanity and 
order will return to baseball. 
Dante Bichette will be hitting 
about .243, the A's and the 
Angels will be battling it out to 
see who finishes in the cellar, 
and Jeff Kent will no doubt 
find himself with a one-way 
ticket on the bus to Double-A 
Huntsville, wondering how 
things went so horribly wrong. 

Some things, however, 
remain the same no matter 
what time of year it is. Just 
look at the bottom of the NL 
Western Division standings -
why, it's our old friends the 
San Diego Padres, who through 
skill, pluck and determination 
managed to eke out two wins in 
their first 12 games. 

The Padres hitters aren't 
hitting, the pitchers aren't 
getting batters out and Blueper, 
the lovable Padres mascot, is 
baving to docIge the bottles and 
small rocb that disgruntled 
fans are lobbing at his bead. In 
short, things are u they should 
be.

There wu no'fairy-tale ending to 
the UCSD men's volleyball team's 
season. All season long, the Tritons 

have been un-
able to gain the 
breakthrough 
win that would 
push them over 
the top, and 

.,..._.J-...... ....,-. their final two 
contests of the 
year were no 
different. 
Universtiy of 
Pacific and 
Stanford Uni-
versity invaded 

the Main Gym and dealt UCSD two 
more losses to close out their sea-
son. 

On Saturday evening, Stanford 
University traveled to San Diego 
boasting its number-two ranking in 
both the Mountain Pacific Sports 
Federation and in the nation. The 
Cardinal made quick work of the 
overmatched Tritons, earning a 
straight-set victory by scores of 15-
2,15-5,15-7. 

UCSD wu only able to muster a 
meager .039 hitting percentage while 
the powerful Stanford squad, which 
played its starting six throughout in 
preparation for the coming play-
offs, dominated the net, putting up 
an incredible .450 hitting percent-
age. 

The Tritons proved to be their 
own worst enemies tallying 30 kills 
in the match only to shoot them-
selves in the foot by committing 27 
errors. 

"We were just too tight," Head 
Coach Doug Dannevik said. "Maybe

that wu because of the special oc-
caion and all of the parenta that 
came to watch." 

The match marked the conclu-
sion of UCSD's season and wu a 

chance for the team to say farewell 
to ita four graduating seniors, 
Lamson Lamm, Steve Kremser, 
Chad Hinkle and Geoff Givens. The 
foursome wu honored between 
games two and three in a ceremony • 
which ended with a standing ova-
tion for the Tritons' graduating class 
of '94. 

On Friday night, UCSD hosted 
the Tigers ofUOP and put up a good 
fight before succumbing to Pacific 
by scores of 11-15, 6-1S, 16-14, lO-
IS. The Tritons' start wu sluggish, 
u indicated by their combined hit-
tina percentage of negative .011 in 
the fint two games of the contest. 

"We b.d a very poor start," 
Daanevik said, "and I really don't 
know wby. We bit terribly in thole 
fi ... two ..... ud it COlt us in the 
ead. "

cific ......... I." UIIIiI die

Dannevik called a time-out and im-
mediately began rebuff'mg the ref-
erees for their lack of consistency in 
making calls. 

Unfortunately, this break seemed 
to work against the Tritons, with 
Pacific charging out of the time-out 
to capture the next five points and 
taking a 14-9 lead. UCSD remained 
calm and mustered a run of its own 
to close within two points at 14-12. 

Pacific bumed a time-out to try 
to stifle the Tritons' momentum, but 
UCSD came back out onto the floor 
with fire in its eyes, and after saving 
three match points, put the game 
away and brought the crowd roaring 
to its feet. 

"I was really proud of the way 
we came back in game three," 
Dannevik said. "We made good 
strides in that game. We just weren't 
clicking in the first two." 

The fourth game wu tight at 8-6 
in favor of the Tigers, but Pacific 
won seven ofthe next nine points to 
take the game and the match in four 
sets. 

Junior Tom Black and senior 
Lamson Lamm each smashed home 
13 kills to lead UCSD's offensive 
charge, while junior Tyson Kerr tal-

_lied 12 put-aways and five blocks in 
the contest. 

So, the Tritons' long and labori-
ous seuon has come to its expected 
end. No one thought UCSD could 
beat the nation's top seeds, which
