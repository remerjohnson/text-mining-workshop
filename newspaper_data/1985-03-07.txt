The grant gl\'es the project four Apple 
computers , printers and modems for 
each of the six si tes . The San Dtego 
location Will be a class at Ihe Lincoln 
Middle School In Vista taughl by 
Barbara Mlller-Souviney. 

"The pLm is for college students to 
work with high school students helpll1g 
them carry out social sCie nce projects:' 
Riel said . "These projects can prOVide 
motivallng environme nts for learnll1g 
about one's own culture 111 contrast to 
other cultures while helpll1g students 
gain skills in reading, writing, the use of 
technology and research methods." 

UCSD students in a class taught by 
jim Levin are currently working with 

other college students on the network to 
plan the socl.ll sCience proJects, One of 
the projects which will get underway in 
the nCJr future is a cross-Jge , cross-
generational stud), of (areer JspirJtions. 

"In thi S project." Riel explained, "T he 
high school students .It e.ICh of the 
locJtions will II1tervlew their 
grandparents and parcnts about their 
cart:rr aspirations and the Jobs the)' 
actually ended up dOll1g, then compare 
these with their own career JspIr<ltIons." 

The data from each of the sites will 
he stored 111 a computer data program 
and shared electronically with all of the 
other sites, With the college students 
translating the languages where 
necessary. 

"The high school students can then 
pose que tlons which could be 
answered by thiS data bank," Ri el said. 
"For example, students may want to 
look ..It sex differences, hanges 111 
women's roles or cultural patterns. 

'The goal of this project will he to 
have high sc hool students write up their 
datd 111 a form that will be II1tercsting 
enough to bc published ," Rlcl continued. 
"The notion is to get the kids II1volved 
in a whole task . They're not just doing 
this as an exercise. They're doing it to 
find out information and share It with 
other people ." • 

Some of the other projects planned 
are an analYSIS of the content of 
newspapers and news reporting at eac h 
of the sites, a comparison of the 
educational systems and a genealogy-
migration study. 

"Wc're explonng a new way of doing 
education ," Rleld said . "We're actually 
gotng back to many of the thll1gs Oohn) 
Dewey said. We're trying to bring 
society IntO the sc hools and make then. 
places where kids learn about what It 
means to be important members of 
SOCIe ty. Technology prOVides a potentiJI 
for reorg,.II1i zlIlg instruction that hasn't

UC faculty win salary hike approval 
By JANE ROSENBERG, Sa ral1lell/() CorrcsponaL' /Il 

T HE UN lVERSLTY OF alifornia won initial approval for a f.lculty salary hike laSt Thursday. despite 
the effons of the Legislativc Analyst. 

The Senate Budget and Fiscal Review 
subcommittee, revieWing UC's requests 
thIS week, voted unanimously to 
approve the 8.8% increase even though 
the analyst said I( was poorly Jus tified 
and un necessary. 

The subcommittee also voted against 
the analyst's recommendation on 
increasing student fees this fall , 
according to a proposed formula which 
will not go into effect until the 1986-87 
school year. 

The Legislative Analyst, in the annual 
critique of the governor's budget 
released Wednesday and in testimony 
before the subcommittee Thursday, 
urged legislators to save $5 mil ion in 
state funds by reducing UC's request for 
a salary hike from 8.8% to 7.3%. 

Hal Geiogue of the Analyst'S OtTice 
also argued that the 1.5% "competitive 
margin" in faculty salaries UC is seeking 
th rough the larger salary increase was 
the result of a budgeting error made last 
year. 

Geiogue also cri ticized the argument 
pushed by UC President David Gardner 
before the subcommittee Wednesday, 
and repeated by other UC officials 
Thursday, thm higher salaries arc 
necessary because of California's steep 
hOUSi ng COSts. 

Assistant professors at UC Berkeley 
can expect 92% of their salary to go 
toward housmg and UCLA professors 
lookll1g for housing in West Los Angeles 
can anticipate that L20% of their 
ea rnings will finance their new home, 
UC Vice President for Academic Affairs 
William Frazer told the subcommittee, 

"I get very, very tired of hearing 
hOUSing COStS thrown a t us ," Geiogue 
responded . "You give a person a loan, a 
subsidized hOUSing package, but not a 
salary increase. Don 't use housing COStS 
as a rationale . That's a bad mtionale." 

Geioge also noted that 60% of the 
6 ,000 faculty members eligible for the 
increase a re full professors earning 
apprOXimately $50,000 a year, and only 
a small number of aSSistant professol' 
would be aflected . 

Geiogue also recalled that the 
Leglsl,l(ure approved last year's increa~, 
o f 12%-ptltting UC salarIeS 1.5% abol'e 
the average earnings of professor at 
com parable ul1lversities-only because 

the governor had overhudgeted Ihe item. 
"The Regents have always asked that 

salaries reach parity. This is the first 
lime th ey've asked for thi s competitive 
edge and we don 'l think they need that 
edge," Geiogue said 

But UC Budget Director Larry 
Hers hman nOled the Legis lature 
knowingly approved the extra funds . 

On Wednesday, Gard ne r tOld the 
subcommittee that elimina ting the 1.5% 
would "give aU the wrong sigmlls" to 
faculty members . 

Two faculry members, including 
SystemWide Academic Senate Cha irrnan 
Wilson Smith of UC Davis, also testified 
before the subcommittee. a rguing lhat 
last year's salary hike had a tremendous 
positive effect. 

UC Student Lobby Director jim 
Lofgren said the University may have a 
harder time winning approval for the 
hike as the budget moves th rough the 
Assemhly Ways and Means 
subcommittees. Although the Senate 
subcommittee was sympathet iC, the 
chairman , Sen. Walter Stiern, D-
Bakersfield, questioned whether the 
higher salaries will improve recruiting 
effon s , as UC o tTicials argued. 

The subcommittee quickly approved 
the governor's proposal to maintain 
student fees at their curre nt levels , 
ignoring the analyst's recommendation 
to raise undergraduar.e fees $91 and 
graduate fees $31. 

Under Senate Bill L95, fees would 
i nerease to the proposed levels thiS year 
if the Tee's formula were in place next 
fall. Enacting the formula now could 
save the state $7 .4 mi llion, the analyst'S 
report notes. 

But the bill , to be considered by the 
Senate Educallon Committee March 13, 
states that fees must be set ten months 
before the stan of the new school yea r, 
a deadline which has already beeen 
missed. 

Last-minute fee increases in I98L-82 
caused "significant problems for parents 
and students," Hershman said . "One of 
the main concerns of this subcommittee 
and the governor was the rapid fce 
increases. The governor wants a 
moratorium on fee increases and we 
support the governor's budget." 

Gard ncr also told the subcommittee 
Wednesday that the University fully 
suppons SB 195 and that the Regents 
have a lready voted not to mise fees next 
year. ~

Visiting lectures 
cantpaign for raises 

The 2,236 VISiting Umverslry of California lecturers took their campaign for better 
salaries and undergraduate education to the state Legislature T hursday. Feb. 28, and 
won a voice in UC academic business. 

UC Vice President for AcademiC Affairs William Frazer agreed before a Senate 
Budget and Fiscal Review subcommittee to draft a letter on non-AcademiC Senate 
faculty participauon in forming UC educational policy. 

The non-Sen;lte faculty represented by the Amencan Federation of Teache rs has 
been negotiating ItS first contmct with UC administrators since last May, and 
obtaining a say in academic affa irs has been a key point in the diSCUSSions for them . 

In a written statement to the senators, AFT Chief NegotiatOr Marde Gregory asked 
for a freeze 111 admll1lstrJtion spending in order to fund a 30% II1crease in 
undergraduate classes. new field trips. laboratones and special seminars. She also 
asked that a faculty commiSSIOn including non-Senare lecture rs be fo rmed to study 
the quality of undergraduate instruction and tha t UC conduct a comparable worth 
study on non-Sen<lte f"culty. 
Gregory said , whIch could lead to a salary II1crease for the lecturers. 

Increasi ng the undergraduate classload by 30%, a move which could COSt $17 
million according to AFT, would proVide more work for the lecturers. whose average 
salary is only $12,500 because they only work pan-time 

-We co me to the Universiry with the same credentials but our focus is somewhat 
differe nt ," Gregory said. "We are in the teaching profeSSion. We shouldn't be 
penalized for having to make that choice " 

Gregory only dlsclIssed the proposal to increase classload and her other 
suggestions weren't addressed by the senators, who we re more concerned With her 
contention that VISiting lecturers account for a IJrge percentage of undergraduate 
Instruction. 

At Santa Barbara , lecturers arc responsible for 67% of lower diVISion instruction 
when they only make up 22% of the faculty. the UCU\ speech lecture r tOld the 
subcommittee. 

Frazer quarreled with Gregory's figures , which he said she obtall1ed from the 
University. Frazer estim,lted that -+0% of ail undergr.lduate courses at Santa Bdrbara 
and 25% at UCLA are taught hy VISltll1g faculty wit hout tenure . 

Frazer claimed that the AFT figures II1cluded non-credit remedl,ll courses but 
Gregory said such courses were removed from AFT's inventory 

The UC officials dltributed the higher romo of viSiting lecture rs II1volved in 
undergraduate instruction at Sanm Barbam to the campus' high faculty vacancy r.lIe. 
estimated at 22%. 

But the disparity in figures as well as Frazer's admission that-+O% of undergraduate 
instruction at just one campus was provided by non-Senate faculty worned legislators , 
who urged the pair to work the problem out. 

"I'd think twice about sending my daughter to undergraduate work with even the 
percentage yo u mentioned ," Subcommmittee Chairman Sen . Walter Stiern , D-
Bakersfield , told Frazer. 

"Research is fine and writing books is fine . but an II1stllution of thar size, you can't 
play around with undergraduate work ," Stiern co ntinued . 

Gregory's mention th,1t 51.8% of the non-Senare faculty are minomies and wumen 
also concerned senators. B>' comparison , only 22% of the ~nate faculty are ImnDnt ics 
and women. 

Fmzer acknowledged the problem and admitted the Universi ty's record on 
affirma tive action could be unproved He sa id omcIals Me taking sreps tll upgrJde

A Paisley Manifesto 
We stayed up all night, my friends and I, under hanging eucalyptus 

boughs with fences of chainlink steel, fences purple like our words, full of 
pretentious mystery like them, with the Illusory meaning of psychedelic 
thought. 
"Let's go! " she sa id . "We must shake the doors of perception, tcst the bolts 
and hinges . Let'S go!" 
"But wait ," I said, "before we show that acts are full , we must show that words 
are emptyl" 

So, I followed the word of the great one who said: "To launch a manifesto 
yo u have to want A, B. & C, and fulminate agai nst 1.2 & 3," and we dedare 
to the cosmos. 

1. BeJore we Icav.: evelything and se t out on the rood, we want to Imow we can 
change things. 
2 We denounce the cold blankness oj cc",ent. We denounce the ce ment oj a 
campus with neither comJort nor beauty Even if we cannot bring comJort and 
beauty, we call bring life. and hope, comJort and beauty will JoUow. 
J The vandal may be the eqUivalent oj u leper. The revolutionary may be the 
equivalent oj a leper. If so, we selld leperous propaganda by deed against the 
patemalists and the pedants and their con Jomlity and their concrete. 
4. We use the power oj art to fight those who use the an oj power. We use the 
madness oj art to fight those who use the reason oj conJormity. 
5. Only art has meaning. On!>, art.istic self-caused action can bring meaning. In 
order to brillg meaning to this campus we make a leap oj art. 
6. We may be playing wllhfire, but without fire one gets cold,and this campus isas 
cold as cemen t. 
7. Say not, "Forgll'e them, they know not what they do. " but rather, "Bless them, 

Jor they, aI least , arr doing." 
8. We ca ll Jar a vanety oj doing. This is PAISLEY: madness, wisdom and irollY. 

AND WE WARN YOU, 
WE ARE NOT NICE.

UNDERGROUND 

A response 
By ROBERT LEONE, Staff Writer 

Sometime , on the night of March 5, 1985, a person or persons, as yet 
'unknown , took advantage of the late hour and full moon to scrawl and s tencil 
all sorts of disgusting, or meaningless, things all over campus. The vandal 
(who left the initials UPA, trusting that people would automaticaUy know 
who or what he or she stood for) , aside from leaving meaningless symbols aU 
over buildings, w,i1kways and locker units , also scrawled (in red spray paint) 
such messages as "Kill Cops" and "What Do You See?" 

I felt violated. This wasn't the hidden , meaningful , literate writings of 
UCSO; graffiti writers who use the rarely visited stairwells of AP&M or H&SS 
to write things (both truth a nd lies) of beauty, who on occasion pour their 
souls onto the latex paint, who carry on wall dialogues for months, or weeks, 
or years . This was some strange person, putting nonsensical , stupid 
messages where many students would be forced to see them ; not priming 
small, to save space , but spraying large, so that his or her egot ism would be 
seen for years, so that some trace of him o r her would remain here foras long 
as possible . Obviously, he or she was an uncaring ego maniac who could not 
make a mark any other way, excepr the most glultonous, swine is h way of all . 
The whole point of this action was not to distribute the message "Kill Cops ," 
for if they really believed that , they would be out plotting, and not wasting 
their time spray painting stupid things on a college campus. No, they Just 
wanted to spray paint something, and a negative; image, a negative slogan, 
sprang immediately to their feeble minds. No, this person was not one of 
UCSO's wall-scrawling population, nor could he or she be compared to our 
usual graffiti artists. A much better comparison would be with the Stuart 
Collec tion. 

At the Sruart Collection, it's the fame of your name that's the name of the 
game . Famous artists are courted , are asked to produce a piece for this 
campus simply because they are famous and "important." Students, the 
population that until Bruce Nauman's neon piece was planned for Mandell 
Wiess, were a captive audience for every s ingle new Stuart Collection piece 
(the Sun God,lhe untitled Robert Irwin sculpture made out of purple fence, 
Robert Aeishner's La Jolla Projec t 1983-1984 Icommonly called 
Revellehengel. the Love Man in Central Library); were never asked , in a large 
body, their opinions about a piece of art before acquisi tion plans were 
complete. That IS why we are getting lead-covered trees broadcasting the 
artist's choice of music and poetry, and why we ould have gouen a 15-foot-
diameter basketball escaping from a hoop to symbolize the Scripps 
Inst itution of Oceanography. 

Obviously this "UPA" person considers him or herself as powerful as the 
Stuart Collection; or more powerful , because Chancellor Atkinson surely 
didn 't OK this spray painting. 

Anyway, I don 't like to see people inllicl their glory, their red imagery, 
where everyone will have to see it. That's stupid , foolish and unproductive .

was one of the first people LO arrive at the scene of the 
incident where a transient poured lighter nuid over 
himself, and then proceeded to commit suicide at 
Central Library. By Ihe nme I arrived at the scene IhlS 
human tOrch had been fully engulfed in names for 
more than one minute. Several other students and 1 
PUI Out the flames as qUickly as we could with our 
coats, but we were LOO late to save the man. He died 
12 hours laler. 

The next day while detailing my account of the 
incident LO our police depanment here at UCSD, 1 
asked them why more wasn't done to keep tran ients 
off the campus. He showed me a stack of citations that 
had been handed out, and LOld me very bluntly that 
there was nothing more they could do. 

One sees the tranSients all over thiS campus. In the 
weight room, in the gym, and , especially, in all of the 
libraries. These people are easy LO pick out as they arc 
usually very dirty, unshaven , and are often carrying a 
bag with their entire worldly possessions. 

The incident 1 experienced will defmitely not be Ihe 
laSt with transients on this campus. It seems thaI the 
administration, which spends most of its nme 
acquiring multi-million dollar research grants, is totaUy 
unconcemed with arranging adequate security for Ihe 
UC D campus. And our student govemment seems 
more concemed with protecting the rights of students 
to get drunk than with providing for the safeI)' of the 
students on campus. The number of rape, and thefts 
on this campus is appalling and yet so little is said or 
done about it. 

Surely, with the amount of money that is nowmg 
IntO UCSD from Sacramento we can fmd a little bi t to 
inc rease campus securil)' . We should have police 
officers regularly inspecting the open bUildmgs on 
campus, day and night. We should consider fencing 
off the campus, and allowing people in only at 
checkpOints manned with police olTicers. And , we 
should press the city of San Diego LO solve the 
transient problem that they have si mply shifted LO 
other areas with their downtown redevelopment plans. 

Our ambitious Chance llor Richard Alkmson pndes 
himself on bUilding the reputation of our prestigious 
UniVerSity, but shows a careless neglect for the students 
of this campus. What will it take for the bureaucracies 
involved LO finally lake ;lction about the most seriOUS 
problem facing this campus? Will it take the death or 
seriOUS mJury of one of our students before the clowns 
in the administration and student govemment wake 
up?

Editor's nOle: To SCI the rccord straight, Stephcn Roberts, 
the man who committed suicide in order to exemplifY the 
irratIOnality of Ihe nuclear race, was not In any sense of the 
defimtion a transient . The construdion of a police state at 
UCSD, whICh would set ablaze the already unstable, timid 
consciousness of our community, is an inappropriate eulogy 
for one who martyred himself so that we could better 
undersland our own rational insanilY.

Miller's message 
Editor: 

As concemed stud ents, we wish to state that we 
disagree with the View" expressed m Roben 
Carpenter's letter in the Monday, March 4 Guardian 
regarding beer company sponsorship. Contrary to 
some people's beliefs, beer companies spend a lot of 
money to help fight alcoholism and substance abuse . 
Take for example Miller Brewing Company's pamphlet 
entitled SOI1l~body Do Somelhing: A Perspt:crivc on Ihe 
Issue of tlie Abu,e of A/co/wl. It takes a thorough look at 
the issue and aHemptS 10 draw some poSitive 
conclusions. It is e ndor I'd by the American Council 
on Alcoholism . This document was handed out at the 
Students For Responsible Drinking meeting. It is 
unfonunate thai so many people are quick to blame 

the breweries themselves for Ihe problem of alcohol 
ab use, when in actuality the beer makers havc been 
very helpful in working towards a solution 10 the 
problem. Instcad of placi ng blame , we should all work 
as one to find a solution that is agreeable to all 
concemed panies (i .e. both Ihe stude nts and the 
administration). Millions of drivers break the speed 
limit every day. Does this mean that we are 10 blame 
cars and car compan ies lor the problem. or is the 
driver abUSing the law? If more people would 
take time to look at both sides of the issue and 
not jump 10 uninformed conclusions, we could all 
work together 10 construc ti vely solvc the problem 
at hand.

Cover story 

UCSD gets $1.00 million super computer 
By SEAN WAGSTAFF, News Edilor 

W H EN ISAAC NEWTON described the motions of the planets, he based his theories 
o n observations and mathematical 
calculations. When Francis Crick and 
James Watson developed their model of 
the helical structure of DNA, they based 
their theory on a model based on 
chemical and mathema tical principles. 

What if some modem-day Newton, 
Crick or Watson decided 10 forecast 
earthquakes weeks in advance or design 
a molecular key to unlock the mystery of 
cancer? Although our knowledge of the 
weather and biochemistry predicts that, 
in theory, such feats are possible , the 
number of mathematical calculations 
necessal)' is astronomicaDy large: as Carl 
Sagan might say, billions and billions. 

But what if those calculations-which 
in Newton's time would have taken 
many lifetimes, which when Crick and 
Watson proposed the structure of DNA 
in 1953 would have taken years, and 
which even now might rake an 
impractically long and expensive 

amount of time on UCSD's most 
powerful computers-could be done in 
a few seconds? 

Last week the National Science 
Foundation (NS~) deSignated UCSD as 
one of four sires for national "super 
computer centers," each of which will 

h~ one of the fastest, most powerful 
computers available in the world . 

Calculations that now take hours on 
big, main-frame computers, such as 
UCSD's VAX, may be done in seconds 
on the super computer. 

Some examples of the types of 
systems that can benefit fro!fl super 
computer use include: continental and 
global models of the atmosphere for 
weather prediction: molecular models 
for study of material properties and for 
design of new drugs: aircraft designs , for 
development of more efficient airfoils 
and lighter, stronger structures: and 
astronomical data, for a better 
understanding of the structure and 
origins of the universe . 

Until now, the only super computers 
in existence were owned and operated 

full time by places such as the Nalional 
Weather Service for weather forecasting 
and Lawrence livermore Labomtorics 
for fUSIOn research . According to Dr. 
Donald Anderson , UCSD representative 
to the super computer steering 
committee , -What was needed was 
something for the general research user: 
a national center of a general SOrt." 

Congress' 1985 budget provided $40 
million to the NSF to begin establishing 
a network of super computer centers. 
The centers will Significantly improve 
the tools available to the nation's 
scientiftc and engineerin)!. communities 

to better our competitive edge against 
technologically competitive countries. 

Governor George Deukmejian, who 
has pledged $1 million per year for the 
next ten years to help finance the San 
Diego Super Computer Center, issued a 
statement concerning the selection of 
San Diego as a site for the computer, 
saying, "The San Diego Super Computer 
Center is a superb investment in the 
future of California and the nation. 1 
believe it will be a major contributing 
faclOr in our effons to attract new, high-
technology growth in the state. It 
cenainly enhances the worldwide 
SCientific prestige of California." 

UCSD Chancellor Richard Atkinson 
called Deukmejian's decision to help 
fund the center "a major factor in our 
bei ng selected as one of the national 
centers."

Atkinson echoed Deukmejian's earlier 
remarks , sayi ng, -The San Diego Super 
Computer Center will be a key element 
in helping advance Anlerican science 
and engineering through the use of 
super computers. 

"It will accelerate basic research that 
underpins American tec hnologIcal and 
industrial progress. Moreover, this 
project will make San Diego a national 
ce nter for academic researc h using 
super computers. 

Roughly speaking, a super compute r 
is the fastest , most powerful design 
available , super make 

possible the solution of more difficult 
problems than ord inary computers 
because of their vel)' fast openlling 
speeds. Because of those speeds, they 
are capable of prOViding more exact 
simulations o f real physical systems. 

For example, Scri pps Institution of 
Oceanography is currently monitoring 
seismic activity on the ocean noor a ll 
over the world . The huge volume of data 
from remote sensors that is transferred 
by sateUite to Moffet Field near San Jose 
cannot be analyzed without the speed of 
a super computer. "There are huge 
records to sort and analyze," Anderso n 
explained. "By the time that data could 
be used to predict an eanhquake, the 
earthquake will have already happened." 

enormous genes to keep track of-in 
the VAX systems you run out of memory 
a nd into Other problems .. .. Some of 
those calculations take impractical 
lengths of time. If a calculation takes 
two years, it becomes impractical. .. 
whereas you can afford to wait a day for 
your results." Anderson said that the 
super computer can make a "qualitative 
difference because of quantitative 
differe nces." 

A lack of access to super com puters is 
slowing the advance of the US scientific 
community, according to Anderson. He 
said that scientific researchers in fields 
suc h as molecular biology, atmospheriC 
and ocean scie nce, economics, 
psychology, panicle physics, geophysics, 
structural e ngineering, c hemistry, 
materials science, aerodynamics and 
electric circuit design, have all 
demonstrated that they could benefit 
from the power of the super computer. 

Plans call for the computer LO be 
operatio nal by early 1986 and for the 
center to be constructed around it The 
center will probably be built on a si te 
north of the Institute of the Americas, 
pending approval, Anderson said. 

The San Diego Super Computer 
Center will be housed in a 50,000-
square-foot building o n the UCSD 
campus It will be operated on an 
approximately $100 million budget over 
I next ten years. 

fhe building will be constructed 
specifically for the super computer and 
will include: offices for 60 full-time 
employees, training facilities to teach 
researchers and students the most 
effective techniques for usi ng super 
computers, space for scientific meetings, 
a librJry, and offices for visiting 
researc he rs. 

Anderson also said the computer 
occaSIOnally will be available to students, 
explai ning that cenain educational a reas 
suc h as computer graphics have a 
unique need for access to such a 
machine. 

Persons wishing to gain computer In biology, the computer will be used 
for DNA sequencing, among other 
things , Anderson said. 'There are > COrmNUED ON PAGE 8 )

State Senator Gary Hart 

Senator proposes state/ corporate work study 
By JANE ROSENBERG, SlIoamelil" COITI:~POIIJt:1I1 

Responding 10 cuts in federal 
fi nanCial aid , Sen. Gary Han, D-Santa 
Barbam, has proposed .1 new work study 
progr.lm which could help 1,500 
students 111 its first year. 

Hart 's proposal, Senate Bill 417 , would 
appropriate $1.5 million to stan a 
program 111 which privatc employers 
and non-profit corpor.ttions would pay 
half of a work stud y student's salary 

Prof says Johnson 
lied about Vietnam 
National network television filmed Larry Bermann , UC Davis professor and author 

of Planning a Tragedy, Thursday, Feb. 21, during a UCSD political science class lecture. 
The footage will be aired in an NBC documentary on Vietnam April 26. 

While doing research at a public library, &nnann diseovered declassified memos 
between Lyndon B. Johnson's advisors on the pros and cons of US military activity in 
Vietnam. 

"At first 1 wdsn't sure what 1 had- I just knew the papers said something different 
than what the people had been told: said Bennann, "Johnson and Nixon had lied 10 
the public ." 

In spite of warnings from White House advisors.Johnson refused to concede in his 
war effons and to admit his miscalculations. The fonner President clearly misjudged 
the situation, said Bermann: he underestimated American public opinion and the 
capacity of US ground forces in Southeast Asia, and he assumed the fighting would 
not esealate . As the war progressed and intensified :~ohnson lied and deceived the 
American people about the extensiveness of the war and expectations for military 
~ victory," said llermann. 

However, Bennann nOted , the US goals were admirable in that democracy WdS a 
better fonn of government. 

"I'm representative of a revisionist view of what Johnson could halll: done." 
The Vietnam War proved to Americans that the military is limited and that the 

President, in a democracy, needs the suppon of the people in order to successfully 
win a war, the author lectured . 

"The domestic repercussions are with us today," said Bermann. 'We have lost the 
ability to think critically when we are faced with a decision to commit liS trOOps 
overseas."

while the statc finances the other half. 
The progrdm ai ms to provide job 

tmining while inc re.lsing the state's 
financial aid resources, Silid Greg 
Gollihur, the California Postsecondary 
Educat ion CommiSSion research 
associate, who conducted a feasibility 
study on the proposal. 

"This program presents a r.tre 
opportunity to benefit both students .Ind 
pOtential employers through a 
pannership that helps students defray 
their educational costs, prOVides ca reer 
exploration and job skill tmining," Hart 
said when introducing his bill February 
H . 

"Ris ing educational costs, recent 
reductions in fedeml finanCial aid and 
heavy student indebtedness all point to 
the need 10 stretc h our resources 
further," he added. 

The work study proposal is modeled 
after progmms in 16 other states, suc h 
as Washington, Virginia and 
Massachusetts. In Washington , the 
decade-old progmm accounts for about 
half of the $15 million in financial aid 
the state administers each year. 

But California's program, if approved 
by the legislature and Gov. George 
Deukmejian, would differ from the 
Washington model by requiring that halt 
of the state funds go toward financing 
students in off-campus jobs. 

"The thrust of this is not that It be a 
.simple augmentation to a federal work 
study program," Gollihur said. "This 
accomplishes a different set of goals .. . 
It's thrust is to establish a link between 
education anc! employment." 

In the. 1983-84 school year, California 
students earned 550 million in feder,,1 
work study money. In 1982-83, when 
the state received 544.4 million through 

the progmm, UC student s earned $9 
million . 

Curre ntly, most students work on 
campus. Private college students, 
however, are prohibited by state law 
from taking on-campus jobs. The bill, 
however, would allow the private 
colleges to administer the state- funded 
progmm while having its students work 
for private employers, 

The bill also calls for an advisory 
committee , made up of students, 
financial aid officers, private employers 
and re presentatives from state agencies, 
which will decide who will opemte the 
program in the pilot stage. 

Three campuses from each sector of 
higher education - the community 
colleges, California State Univesrity, UC, 
private institutions and vocational 
schools- will be chosen, Gollihur said. 

Some $300,000 will be rese rved for 
stan-up costs , such as establishing a 
state office, and the remaining $1.2 
million wouldn't be used until the 1986-
87 sc hool year, when the program 
would begin. 

Between 1,200 and 1,500 students 
would probably participate in the first 
year, Goilihur said . The bill's backers 
hope to obtain funding for another year 
before ev-dluating the program and 
deciding whether to make state-funded 
work study in California permanent. 

Gollihur said he doesn"t anticipate 
any opposition to the measure, and 
noted it comes at a time President 
Reagan is cuning every fi nancial aid 
program except work study. 

"It's not a huge appropriation and 
allocation, and given the accountability 
of this program and its success in other 
states, we think he (the governor) will 
support it: said Karen Lowry, Senate 
Education Commiuee consultant. IZ:I

to take ow some 01 the $2 million

Over on our (oast, there's 
another guy named Doug thaI has

the mIle run , most (ompettlurs 
collapse in el heap on the infield 
and groan l'or a week. 

Roche finished his mile strong, 
st.mding up. and with a big slnJle 
on his lace. He knew he was 
pulti ng the neld or twenty 
L:hallengers to bed. HIS 5851 point

was nm nCdr enough. 

The Illlpresslvc thing abow

pretensions about competing in

12 Thursday, Ma rch 7, 1985 

By VAN HUTCHINSON 

H E TALKED WITH ANIMATION, pointing 10 chans and graphs chronl hng the nse ;md faU of 
the ,mcients. The panidpants of the 
annual convention of the Instirute of 
ArcheologICal Research Srudles were 
well-pleased wIth Dr. Fitzhimmon's 
presentation. It had been even better 
than hIS [dlk on pnmlllve rocket travel 
last ye,lr, in 3497. 

After a hea ny round of appl,lUse , one 
palllcipant raIsed her hand . "Dr. 
Fitzhlmmons, could you tell us about 
some of your latest research? Is It true 
you're working on an underwater 
excavation ?" 

"Yes. I'm glad you asked , because our 
research team and anthropological 
expertS team say this latest findi ng is 
very significant. The Site is weU-
preserved, because the entire area was 
suddenly submerged somewhere 
between the years 1980 and 2000 
Though our conclUSIons are r,l[her 
tentative, we have a fairly good glimpse 
into the life of post-ancient civilization. 

"First, we are most confident that the 
site was one of rehglous significance. It 
appears that a communiry of believers 
nocked to this site for rites of 
purification. Some of our expertS 
estimate this process of cleansing the 
mind lasted four years or more." 

"Excuse me, Dr, Fltzhlmmons," asked 
a taU listener. - But how do you know it 
was a religious center?" 

"T 0 be perfectly honest , we had some 
doubts ourselves until a team worki ng 
near the base submanne uncovered a 
huge idol. Its brightly colored wings are 
saId to symbolize the successful 
purification, and its claws and beak 
represented the ve ngeance upon those 
who failed. In fact , a hollowed-out 
chamber below suggests an al tar for 
sacnfi e." 

"Human saCrifIce?" murmured several 
of the partlclp,lnts. 

"No, no. This community appears by 
all indicators to be non-violent. For 
example, It conspIcuously lacks the 
fighting arena that marks nearly every 
other Site of this type. An abundance of 
pnmltive transponatlon vehIcles 
suggests that these people were trained 
to nee from danger. -

"We also believe the post-ancients 
had severJI other lesser deities. One of 
Ihe most Interesting was a senes of 
heads mounted upon a pole. Apparently 
by offering it small tokens of sacrifice 
and rweakmg the nose , one could aven 
danger and penalty from The Grim 
Reaper. 

"We also found a Similar set 01 idols, 
e.lch with a series of buttons and one 
la rge eye. One of our younger members 
suggested in Jest that It migh l have been 
an ,mcie nt precursor to our bIological 
computers , but the evidence dearly 
shows that the idols were conSidered 
omdes. Through proper stroking of the 
buttOns, the oracles could be coaxed 
Into changing the coloring of the eye. 
The worshipper then had to Interpret 
what it meam since the prophesies were 
given in hard-to-understand codes." 

"Dr. Fitzhimmons, what have you 
discovered about the SOCial life of thiS 
culture?" asked a red-haired womJn 
from the back. 

"One consistent finding is th ,1t there 
was a deflnitel:.lste sys tem, or more 
simply, a ruling class and subservll:nt 
class. The priests responSible for the 
mind-cleanSing held incredible power 
over the ),oung pllgrtms, who would 
stru\.turc their daily hves around 

ng an rr.emonzlng 
which were !>poken. An ancient 
dowment, mir.ll:ulously preserved in a 
plastic bag, has heen analyzed. Our 
expert in anclem languages has been 
able to decipher few of the words. There 
was a refere nce to something cryptically 
referred to as a TGI F, which seems to 
ha ve been a ritual performed near a 
round mound. We think thiS mound is 
a barrow, or burial ground , lor im ponJnt 
priests. The subservient class 
commemorate the deJth with drinking 
an equJ lI y wor' hlpped ehxir referred to 
,15 beer Any more question!>?" 

A l.!rge be,lrded P,lrtlCl panr stood up.

Blown away by the Games of Life 
By PHIL LAUDER 

I WAS INTRODUCED to a new game last Saturday night. Phil, meet 
. Diplomacy. Diplomacy, this is Phil. 
We shook hands meekly, not on the 
friendliest of terms. And things didn't 
get any beuer. . 

I never had a lot of board games 
when I was younger. Still don't, actually, 
but there sure are a lot of them around. 
I got my first game when 1 "''liS six-
Dad gave me a Monopoly set. I 
remember being so excited about geuing 
this great big box for a Christmas 
present, and thinking, boy, this is gonna 
be great I tore through the wrapping 
paper and gazed upon the beautiful 
white box. 1 sounded OUt the word on 
the box-"Moe-noe-poe-Iee"-and I 
grinned, even though I had no idea 
what the word meant. Then Dad told 
me it was a brand of underwear. My 
grin vanished. "Oh ... underwear. Well , 
gee Daddy, thank you very much," 1 
said, obviously deflated and probably 
close to tears. As I opened up the box, 
the grin was gone, and I tried to get 
into guessing what color the wasteband 
would be. Then I saw the board with all 
those colored spaces, and I looked at 
the orange and yellow Chance and 
Community Chest cards, and I saw the 
little doggie and the wheelbarrow and 
tfR thimble game pieces, and life was 
great Underwear indeed, 

I still have the Monopoly game. We've 
gone through a lot of miles together. I've 
pretty much got all the property rentS 
mtmmized; for most of the spaces I 
even know how much the rem is for a 
house and a hotel. Vermont Ave. is $550 

.with-taefo:o1tuP1tlt fint house only getS 
you $55 , and without anything aD you're 
going to get is a lousy $6. Over on 
Tennessee , a hotel' gets you $900. 
Illinois gets you a clean $20 every time 
someone lands on it- which happens 
often, especially since there is a Chance 
card with a Monopoly man carrying his 
bag on a stick as he Advances to illinoiS 
Avenue. And , of course, there's the big 
one-Boardwalk. Boardwalk with a 
shiny red hOtel on it. Two thousand big 
ones, buddy Read it and weep. 

Monopoly is a classic. It's utterly and 
completely capitalistic, but such is life. 
It's also utterly and completely 
simplistic. I tell you, I've got it down. I 
admit that 1 reaDy haven't established a 
strategy that guarantees victory every 
time, but that's not the kind of thing 
you do in Monopoly. Just roll the dice, 
dammit. Become plastic-just for two 
hours. Or more. 

1 never had too many other board 
games during my kid hood, unless you 
count Scrabble, which I don 't. When I 
would go to friends' houses and see 
their closetS full of games, I wouW gaze

with envy. "Gosh, that's neat'" "Oh, no 
big deal-we never play them anyway," 
the response would come back, and I 
felt deflated. He's got all these games, 
and he doesn't even play them!? I'd give 
anything for aU those games! Why, I'd 
give up my entire marble collection for 
just three or four of them! Oh, woe is 
me. 

Board games, as I realized Saturday, 
run the gamut or complexity. There are 
the mindless games. Boy are there the 
mindless games. Let's talk Monopoly or 
Life or Uncle Wiggley or Landslide or 
Candyland or Lie , Cheat and Steal or 
Snakes and Ladders or Twister-Twister 

is kind of pushing it, but we're trying to 
build a long list here. Then you move 
up a level or so, and the brain gets into 
the act. Try YahLZee or Masterpiece or 
Clue or Stratego or Careers or Battleship 
or any of the game-showish board 
games: Jeopardy, Password , 
Concentration, et al. Great stuff. 

And then you make the final move. 
Up to the top. Or bottom, depending on 
how you look at it. Risk is about (he 
only one or these I can think of. 
Address your entries in care of this 
station if you think of others. 

Others, that is , meani ng other than 
Diplomacy. What a nightmare. 

Diplomacy is built of the same mold as 
Risk; the object is to conquer the entire 
free world, and unrree world tOO, for 
that matter. And to stab as many people 
in the back, front and side as possible 
within the allotted time. 

Diplomacy is the ultimate in cut-
throat. No dice. All you have is timed 
haggling sessions. "Hi Germany, I'm 
Austria. We're friends. No, really. Let's 
gang up on Russia and kick her butt. 
You and me pal, we 're like this (cross 
your fingers). We'll share the world ." 

And Germany and Austria become 
panners, and scheme on their former 
friends 'til death do everyone pan. They 
feign friendliness with Russia, they 
make pacts with France and Italy that 
last no more than 30 seconds, Ihey 
smile a lot and laugh and generally sell 
their souls to the devil to win this 
stupid game. And bye and bye they 
become the only two players left in the 
game- and a couple minutes after that 
Ausrria is lying on the floor in a pool of 
blood , reaching to his back to pull out 
the knife and offer it ro Germany. 
"Excuse me, I believe this is yours ." End 
of game. 

Saturday night my friend and I sat 
down WIth five more experienced 
players and staned the game cold. The 
object was more or less explained to us: 
kill . The methodology was also 
explained- but not in a language I 
understood-and the gun was sounded. 
Off we wem. All about me I saw people 
handing each other notes, whispering 
clandestinely, sneaking off to back 
rooms of the house to talk and scheme. 
Someone handed me a note: "Germany: 
What are your plans?" Plans? "I'm 
England. I'd hke to head nonh and 
attack Russia. Will you suppon me ?" 
Support? Hullo? 

My mind was numb. I understood the 
object of the game, and that W<lS about 
it-I had no idea what the hell I was 
going to do. Where are the dice? Don't I 
draw any cards? Don't I even get money 
to play with? Nothing? What the hell 
kind of game is this) 

1 never did figure it out. I made a 
rather ungraceful bail-out: "Look guys, 
I'm stupid , OK?" And I gOt up and left. 
That was that. My friend caught on to 
the game, though-which pissed me off. 
He continued for a couple hours before 
getting backstabbed by his "partner" and 
becoming the first one ro be forcibly 
removed from the premises. 

Shoot, ru go back to the good 01' 
days, when the most complicated thing 
to figure Out was whether to make 
someone pay $100,000 or go back ten 
spaces during a Revenge in the game of 
Life. That I could deal with . Cut-throat, I 
don't know about.. ~

Dabasinskas finishes an impressive UCSD career 

The Big Man CODleth 
By MATT LAIT 

T HUNDER LIPS, OX, Moumain Man " , he 's heard them all .md tJkes It in stride, BUI who is Ihis 
guy? UCSD's own walking solar eclipse? 
You may have seen him in the 
welghtroom , stacking the bench pre s 
just to warm up; or wdlking head and 
shoulders above people at Revelle Plaza; 
or, most likely, on the basketball co urt, 
where he has been at home since he 
was a sma ll 6-7 , nO-pound freshman. 
Mike Dab.lsinskas is his name .md 
muscles his fame. 

Mike, or "Dabo" as many of hIS 
friends call him, takes life al an easy 
and enJoY.lble pace, sets his own time 
schedule and remdll1S relaxed . That IS 
his philosophy, on and 00' the COU rt . "I 
played bener when I went 11110 the game 
relaxed and looked to have 40 min utes 
of fun ." And it sure looked as if he did 
have fun Ihls season , smiling at the 
comme nts from the crowd and laughing 
With hIS fellow teammates olnd thc 
COolch on thc bench, while helping the 
T ri tons 10 thei r best record in eight 
years. 

There were moments, however, when 
MIke was not relaxed ; in fact, he had 
moments of frustration which were 
usually directed at the olTiClals. Referees, 
along with opponents, were intimidated 
by his size an d tended to call dose fouls 
and early techmcals to keep hIm In line. 
It goes with the Icrruory of bei ng 6-8, 
260 pound~ (hopmg to work hiS way 
back to hIS more comfortable weight of 
275 pounds now Ihal hasketball tS over), 

IntimIdation is a way of life for Dabo 
whether hc likes it or nor, and he has 
worked 11 well into hIS style of play. 
Most opponems would sce the 
threatenmg roadblock .md refuse to 
challenge him , opting for less imposing 
detours to the hoop It IS olS hard for 

Big Dabo alld hro/lJer LIllie Dabo wcrL 
familiar jaees on the Tnton /l4Jshdhall COU/7 
thiS ra t >cason 

players to ignore him as it is irresistable 
for non-home crowds to heckle him. But 
the name-calling doesn't bother him; 
instead, he says, -I hke it. It m.lkes me 
work harder resulting in me playing 
beller," 

Although Mike looks as if he is a 
coach 's dream cemer, he was nOi alwdYs 
sure he was going to play college ball ; in 
fact, he was nOt even recruited out of 
high school. Dabo chose UCSD because 
of its academics, not its athletics, "The 
choice to attend San DIego was a good 
one, If I had It all to do all over again , I 
wouldn't change a thing, I've made a lot 
of friends that I'll stay in touch wit h for 
the rest of my life. I never met anyone 
on the team during my four years that I 
didn't like ," 

Mike finished his UCSD basketball 
career a complishing new Tr.iton 
records, s uch as his record for most 
rebounds in a smgle game; one of the 
feats he is most proud of. Even though 
[}olbo's college athletic career is over, it 
could be the beginning of a profeSSional 
athletic career The Seattle Breakers of 
the USFL, along with the San Diego 
Chargers and Seattle Seahawks of the 

FL, are showing interest in him 
because of his size, Mike th inks that it's 
l1Iee being scouted, but he still just takes 
it in stride. He's not sure what he is 
going to do about it. What he knows 
right now is that his first priority is to 
finish school and gel his degree in 
Management Sciences. This will take 
him another year. -Then, if they're still 
interested in me, I may consider it more 
seriously," The funny thing in this 
recruiting business is that Mike hasn't 
played football si nce the ninth grade, At 
thai time , a birth defect in his left knee 
was discovered. The doctors gave him 
the choice of playi ng either lootball or 
hasketball . The decision was easy since 
[}Jbo ollways preferred basketball. 

Given the opponunily, Mike would 
rather pia y professional basketball than 

professional football . There is a 
possibility that Dabo could play pro ball 
in Austmlia, A coach from "down under" 
saw Mike perform and told him he 
could easily play there. Even though he 
prefers this oppon uni ty, it would also 
have to wait until grad uation next year. 
-Professional spons never really occured 
to me, It's exciting to think about, but 
not too seriously, What I'd really like to 
do right now is enjoy the rest of my 
time here and maybe stan a business 

"wi th some of my friends. 
Friends are someth ing Mike doesn't 

need to worry about. After the initial 
shock of meeting this m ... n face to face, 
or rather face to stomach , one can truly 
relate to Dabo's congenial personality, 
He does admit, though, tha t his size has 
sometimes made people shy away from 
him, He knows that especially at parties 
some people look a t him and wonder, 
"What the hell Just walked through the 
door?" Again he takes it in stride, but he 
does want people to know that he's "not 
as mean as he looks and he doesn't 
want to bite anybody's head off," Mike 
likes to meet and talk to people, and 
once they meet him, the feeli ng is 
mu tual. Right now, Mike continues to 
take things in stride, but then agai n, his 
stride is bigger than most. ~

Can UCSD 
get to first base? 

Pitching. as jrlshman Leslit Mtyer knows, 
will br Itty 10 UCSD's SUCCtSS in league play. 

By MATT ADAMS 

W OMEN'S SOFTBALL IN the NCAA has been dominated by midwestern and eastern 
schools umil IJst season , UCSD's squad 
went to the national tournament last 
year and surprised the establishment 
with upset victories of tough eastem 
opponents. The '85 Tritons are looking 
to gain another tournament berth, but 
must first prove themse lves in their 
upcomi ng 16-game league schedule, 

The Tri ton record to date is a 
deceiving 1-5, Deceiving because four of 
their first six games were against 
Division [ opponents, Head coach 
Colleen Wight explains the tough early-
season schedule: "Most Division III 
teams do not begin thei r schedule until 
March, We wanted to play some games 
prior to the beginning of our league 
sc hedule. Division I schools do not have 
as many women playing two sports as 
possible, so they can begin tmining and 
their sc hed ule sooner, In other words, 
the Division I schools were the bnly 
schools available for us to play," 

Not being able to play Division III 
schools huns their reco rd , but in the 
long run W ight feels it wiU help the 
team, "I don't mind not having a great 
record, We will be better prepared fo r 
nat ional competition by facing tough 
opponents now, If we played only 
against weak schools to get a great 
record, but d id not really improve as a 
team, I th ink we would be embarrassed 
against tough teams in nationals . If we 
don't measure up now, we don't deserve

THE FISHNECKS 
Fish'neck is an appropriate name for these 

aqualungs, This group spends more time in the 
water than on land. How they have time for 
soccer is beyond me, I guess there are a few land-
lovers on the squad, Anyway, congrats to the 
Scuba Club's Fishnecks for winning their league 
and having a perfect season, 

The tag gets ill the way oj &lmara Arnold and a UCSD victory. 

to go. We may not beat UCSB or SDSU, 
but we find out where we stand as a 
team. We can gam much more in a loss 
to a Division I team than from 
whipping, say, a Cal BaptiSt." 

Seven freshman join five returning 
veterans to give this year's squad a mIx 
of experience and youth. Last year's 
strong performance has PUt a little 
pressure on the '85 Triton team, To 
date , play has been influenced by this 
pressure . No one member of [he team 
has come out and dominated play on a 
consistent basis. "We definitely have the 
potential to be as good as we were last 
year, Unfortunately, we have been 
putting too much pressure on ourselves. 
I hope we can relax in league play; we 
wi ll play much better if we do ," coach 
Wight continued. 

League play begins next week. The 

five-team league includes UCSD. USD, 
La Verne, Whittier and Redlands. This 
weekend wtll allow the Tritons to see 
many of their league opponents for the 
first lime , as the Tritons will be involved 
in th e Redlands tournament that will 
include four of the teams from their 
league (Whittier and La Verne, along 
with UCSD and host Redlands). 

Coach Wight has twO assistants, 
Cathy Williamson played two years at 
UCSD and is cu rrently finishing her 
degree in math, Jody Mitchell spent he r 
playing days at Uta h State before 
coming to UCSD for work on a degree 
in sociology. The entire staff is 
optimistic about their chances in league, 
Coach Wight said , · We finished very 
strong laSt year and I think we have the 
potential to be just as good this 
season." ~

Beyond 
the 
Monument 
By RONAHU 

In the Beginning, there was the 
Sun God. Like a giant pinata gone 
mad, this wildly-colored fiberglass 
fowl alighted atop an incongruously 
heroic "stone" arch one February 
day in 1983 ... and UCSD has never 
been quite the same. 

Two years after its controversial 
appearance on campus, Niki de Saint 
Phalle's whimsical beastie has 
spawned a flock of look-alike key-
chains, T-shirts and, of course, a 
successful festival to its name. As a 
matter of fact, at last year's festival, I 
distinctly recall a woman paying the 
entrepeneurs of KSDT to paint a 
large likeness of the Sun God in all its 
technicolor glory onto her bare leg. 
Clearly, the University and 
surrounding community are 
beginning to take the gold-crowned 
idol to their collective hearts. With a 
wave of its stubby wings, the Sun 
God welcomed and led the way for 
the rest of the Stuart Collection. 

Shown abow is a model far a ICUlpture by Andrea Blum tided Three Pavilion. - Boulder Project. 

Robert Irwin's untitled work was 
installed among the eucalyptus trees 

<&hortly thereafter, not far from the 
court of the Sun God. Irwin's piece 
has attracted less attention from 
students, partly because its violet 
chain-link fencing disappears 
completely in certain lighting 
conditions, and partly because its 
placement high among the trees 
never really confronts the passerby, 
but floats on the edge of perception. 
Matching purple-flowered 
groundcover attempts to grow amid 
the chemical warfare of eucalyptus 
roots. 

The most recent addition to the 
Stuart Collection was completed in 
May 1984 on the lawn south of the 
Humanities Library. The stone 
structures of Richard Fleischner's 
"La Jolla Project" have not had any 
of the Sun God's hoopla, but they 
have been warmly received in their 
own way. Any given sunny day will 
find students eating lunch, napping, 
sunbathing or, quite possibly, 

, 

graduating on or among the giant 
columns and posts. 

Now that we UCSD students have 
these things over us, under us and 
around us, it's time for us to open 
our eyes to the possibilities of public 
art. Beyond the Monument, currently 
being shown at the Mandeville Art 
Gallery, does precisely that. In 
addition, there is an exhibit from the 
Stuart Collection of proposals for 
UCSD's sculpture installations. The 
two shows, presented together, do 
not claim to present all that is new or 
original in contemporary sculpture, 
but they do allow a thoughtful re-
examination of the nature of public 
art. 

Beyond the Monument is a traveling 
exhibition organized by the MIT 
Committee on the Visual Arts. 
Eighteen projects by leading artists 
are presented through photographs, 
models and drawings. Some of these 
projects have actually been 
constructed and can be found in 
various parts of the United States; 
others are still in their planning 
stages. Most are designed to be 
interactive or functional. And one 
will not find a single dead war hero

or mythical Greek god 'among them. 
In fact, many of the works on 

display could not properly be called 
sculpture. There is, for example, 
"The Bookstore" by the ever-
amusing Red Grooms. Here, 
Grooms has redesigned the Hudson 
River Museum's bookstore into a 
colorful chaos of disparate styles. 
The J. Pierpont Morgan Library in 
New York is inspiration for sculpted 
lions and other formal elements, 
while the old Mendoza's Bookstore 
in lower Manhattan provides the 
contrast of friendly confusion. A 
riot of interior design, Grooms' 
bookstore is both a functional shoo 
and a work of art. 

Displayed side by side with photo-
graphs of "The Bookstore" are 
the simple interiors designed by Dan 
Flavin, also for the Hudson River 
Museum. Quite the opposite of 
Grooms' explosion of colors and 
objects, Flavin's work is a restrained 
composition of lines and grids lit by 
cool blue and green flourescent 
lights. Flavin thus turns the act of 
entering a museum into a 
transcendent experience. 

A similarly relilolious feelin~ 

emanates from Jeffrey Schiff's 
project for Boston's South Station. 
When completed, Schiff's work will 
include a grouping of 12 granite 
columns, each ten feet high, in and 
around a low granite enclosure. 
Besides its purely practical functions 
as a landmark in a busy railroad 
station and as an effective director of 
traffic flow, the South Station 
Project will also provide a place of 
calm and contemplation amid the 
bustle of people. 

Not even the lighting system of the 
Fulton Street subway station is 
immune to the artist's hand: Nancy 
Holt's "Astral Grating" takes the 
subway gratings out from underfoot 
and turns them into lighting fixtures, 
patterned to recall constellations of 
stars. Holt explains, "I'm interested 
in taking basic technology-like 
plumbing, like electricity, drainage 
systems-and I want to expose them, 
make people more aware of them . ... 
Art needs to be a more necessary 
part of the world, of society." 

Art enters the lecture hall, too. 
Siah Armajani is represented by two 
projects, one of which is "Louis 

pkase tum to page .. 

Mar h 7, 1985 Hiahu 3 



MonUIllent 
COlllillucd from page 3 
Ka hn Lecture R oom" in 
Philadelphia. Lincs from Walt 
Whitman are inlaid into the floor, so 
that art students may ponder over 
(literally) such thought as "School 
began with a man under a tree, who 
did not know he was a teacher, 
dis ussing his realizations with a few 
others who did not know they were 
students ." (And, for the benefit of 
UCSD students stu k in bland 
lecture halls, Armajani gaw a talk 
February 6 as part of the Regents 
Lecturer program). Armaja ni also 
takes lines of text outdoors: his 
Seattle bridges alo ng L a ke 
Washington fea ture excerpts from 
Moby Dick set in bronze. 

Most of the public artworks 

shown are outdoor, open-air· 
projects. These range in size andl 
scope from Ja c kie Ferrara's; 
"Courtyard," a log-cabin -like "play-
habitat," to Robert Morris' huge 
earthwork in an abandom:d gravel 
pit. "California Scenario," by Isamu 
Noguchi, combines six themes, from 
"The Desert Land" to "The Spirit of 
the Lima Be a n," in t o an 
environmental abstract in a Costa 
Mesa shopping plaza. Another 
example of sepa ra te dements 
integrated, "Three Pavilions" by 
Andrea Blum, provides areas where 

olorado residents can si t by 
Boulder Cn:ek and listen to the 
sounds of running water. As artists 
are turned loose onto public parks, 
the most mundane aspects of our 
lives require reth inking: Scott 
Burton sin ks five large stone 
pyramids, points down, into the 
sand to form a picnic table and four

picni elevated to a meaningful act of 
sustenance." Indeed. 

The best works of publi art 
evolve naturally from their 
surroundings. Patricia Johanson has 
proposed two enormous sculptures 
for the Fai r Park Lagoon in Dallas, 
two large water plants whose tangled 
"roots" become walkable paths and 
protect the shorel ine from erosion. 
Judy Pinto adds a to uch of the 
urreal with "Finger Span; For 

Cl imber's Rock" in Philadelphia. 
Hikers along this natun: trail will 
encounter a 7S-foot-long finger 
(slightly bent at the knuckle as 
th o ugh li f ted straight from 
Michelangelo's Adam) acting as a 
bridge across a ravine . 

Because of the scale and cost of 
public art projects, however, the 
artist often has less freedom than the 
painter or sculptor. It is a pity that an 
ex cdlent idea, like Richard 
Fleisc hner 's proposal ' for an 
abandoned reservoir in Jerusalem, 
will never come to fruition . The 
promenade and pool would help to 
bring the area, now bounded by 
barbed wire and weeds, back to life, 
but as the accompanying statement 
puts it, in awesome understatement, 
"because of economic and political 
problems, it seems highly unlikely 
that Fleishner's proposal will be 
realized." 

* * * As a complementary exhibit, the 
UCSD Stuart Collection displays 
pwposals by leading artists to add to 
the sculpture garden. These serve to 
bring the lessons of ~nd the 
Monument closer to home. By now, 
everyone has heard of Bruce 
Nauman's neon tube sculpture of the 
seven virtues and vices, but the 
exhibit in the gallery should educate 
the student about the true nature of 
the project, as well as allay the fears 

of La Jolla residents. 
Another project that has been 

a cc epted by the Advisory 
Committee, three lead-covered 
eucalyptus trees by Terry Allen, is 
scheduled for completion late this 
year. Allen, who had simultaneous 
exhibits last year at both the La Jolla 
Mu cum of Contemporary Art and 
at the M andeville Art Gallery, will 
stamp words and images into the 
lead shingles. One tree will be silent, 
one will play music, and one will play 
poetry from speakers inside the 
trees. The soundtrack, produced by 
Allen, will consist mostly of original 
material with the occasional Aretha 
Franklin thrown in. 

Other proposals range from Roy 
Lichtenstein's huge painted steel 
brushstrokes, giving the impression 
of unreality to a real scene, to Maura 
Sheehan's World War II 
guardhouse, playing speeches by 
Churchill, Stalin, Hitler and 
Roosevelt, and music from the 
period (including "Praise the Lord 
and Pass the Ammunition" and 
"Remember Pearl Harbour March" 
by Swing and Sway with Sammy 
Kaye and the Glee Club. 

&oyond the Monument and The 
UCSD Stuart Collection will be 
shown until Sunday only, so you 
have precious few days left to catch 
it. The Mandeville Art Gallery is 
open Tuesday through Sunday, from 
noon until 5 pm, and charges 
absolutely no admission, so you 
have no excuse not to at least drop by 
and see the miniature model of the 
Sun God. And if there are still 
skeptics among you, remember that 
the most famous example of 
art / architecture was initially 
received with shock and horror. 
Now the Eiffel Tower has become 
the symbol of Paris and of all France.

Former Busboy changing shifts 

The Navigators: charting a new course 
By ANDREW KEELER 

Kevin O'Neal has no juicy tabloid 
stories to tell about his recent 
departure from the popular LA band 
The Busboys to form his own group, 
The Navigators. In fact, he is almost 
apologetic that there were no knock-
down, drag-out, on-stage fights with 
his brother Brian or the rest of the 
group. 

Let's twist and lCt'eam! 
" Playing with a quartet [they have 

a keyboardist at live shows] instead 
of a six-person group has been a nice 
change. You have to work twice as 
hard, but you know and can hear 
when someone is playing well. This 
band is more settled; we don't have 
that bug-eyed, stick-out-your -
tongue sort of show like ~he 
Busboys. However, we have been 
getting pretty animalistic during the 
last couple of gigs ."

"It was just kind of like moving 
out of the house . I had been playing 
with a couple of friends on the side 
while still in the Busboys and then 
The Navigators became more than 
just a hobby. I am really excited 
about the new band."

Being part of an unrenowned band 
has had its advantages for the group. 
They have played smaller clubs and 
recently performed a concert at an 
elementary school for Black History 
Month . This has been a welcomed 
change from the larger gigs for the 
enthusiast ic band leader. 

And how did the group react to his 
resignation. 

"They were a little bit shocked at 
first, but I think deep down they 
knew it was coming. I got a good 
friend of mine to replace me and so it 
was an amicable situation for 
everyone. I'm glad they are doing so 
well and I hope they keep it up. II 

For man: information. call 481·9022. 

One of the last projects O'Neal 
did with the Busboys was to co-write 
"Cleaning Up the Town" which was 
on the Ghostbusters soundtrack and 
received a Grammy nomination. The 
Busboys have grown from a 
mainstay on the LA club circuit to a 
formidable national act. Their 
albums, along with an appearance in 
the movie 48 Hours and a tour with 
Eddie Murphy, have endeared them 
to rock and roll fans of all color. 

This would not seem to be an 
opportune time for the 23-year-old 
singer/songwriter/ bass player to say 
adios. 

"It sure hasn't been easy on my 
wallet." O'Neal remains good-
natured about the sordid wheeling 
and dealing of the record business. "[ 
think there are a lot more reasons 
why [shouldn't have made it this far, 
than why [ should have. I am very 
optimisticj I don't know if it is 
bravery or stupidity, but I am always 
trying to push forward ." 

Completing the triumvirate are 

drummer John Nyman from an LA 
group called Billy Sheets and the 
Undercovers and guitarist Kent 
State, who last recorded with The 
Boy Next Door . 

The Navigators made their San 
Diego debut last week to a 
responsive audience at the Belly-Up 
Tavern and are scheduled to return 
to town next month. 

O'Neal and friends recorded a 
four-song demo tape that they are 
taking to the record companies and 
have been performing live shows 
around California. The sound of the 
Navigators is diversified while 
unquestionably powerful rock and 
roll. They are at once a throwback to 
the beginnings of American rock and 
a modern band with a modern 
sound. Songs like "Something 
About Your" and "Tell Me" are 
good~time party tunes that have soul 
and spirit. 

The group has also just finished 
shooting a video for "Running 
Away," which O'Neal is excited 
about and thinks others will match 
his enthusiasm. "It is very good and 
differentj people are going to notice 
it. "

-Mikel Toombe 

Having grown up in the music 
capital of the world and gone to high 
school on Sunset Boulevard , 
O'Neal's background has made the 
process of starting a new band less 
painful. 

"On one hand we are a new band 
that has to go out and prove 
themselves each night, and on the 
other we are all veterans and have a 
good reputation with the people in 
the business." 

Unlike The Busboys, who made a 
name for themselves with satirical 
son~s about race and politics 
("KKK," "Johnny Soul'd Out" and 
"American Worker"), The 
Navigators are not what you might 
call crusaders. 

"We have been listening to a lot of 
Negro spiritual music lately and it is 
not what they say but how they say 
it. We don't spend all day thinking 
about politics or girls or anyone 
thingj we sing about what is 
important in everyday life. People 
want to hear about the good things, 
too. We're not out to scare anyone 
away right now. It is funny, but this 
is the first band that I have been in 
that my mother likes. 

"Compari ng th e m is like 
comparing linguini and sushi-I like 
them both but it is n ice to have a 
variety . Basically, it doesn't matter if 
you are playing in a stadium or 
someones living room; you have to 
go o ut and do y.our ,?est." 

* * * 
The Navigators name and 

approach to music come from 
O'Neal's appreciation of the pioneer 
spirit and going against the odds. He 
is fond of the American heritage of 
being independent and "sticking to 
your guns." 

"There have been many people in 
this country that were innovative 
and bucked the system. I think there 
are two kinds of people-
trendsetters and trendfollowers. To 
be competitive you have to be 
aggressive and take chances and 
sometimes you alienate yourself. I 
don't like to sit back and let things 
happen." 

The Navigators' music strikes out 
against what he refers to as "the 
homogenization of rock and roll. So 
much of the stuff today is just a 
bland mixture of styles that has no 
heart. We are trying to put the spirit 
of rock and roll into our songs."

Final, tnasterful, theatric 
Illom.ents at U CSD 

Bv JOAN FORSBERG 
It is graduation time for another 

class of Master of Fine Arts 
candidates in UCSD's Professional 
Theatre Training Program. For their 
final thesis projects, these directors, 
designers and actors will present two 
plays in repertory, Shachit.lpt.lnJ,! and 
Frozen ASSI!t5, beginning this week at 
the Mandell Weiss Center for the 
Performing Arts. These productions 
offer UCSD audiences the 
opportunity to see the range and 
diversity of the graduating actors. as 
they perform roles in two distinctly 
different theater pieces. 

Michael Greif is directing British 
playwright Barrie Keeffe's 
outrageous comedy Frozen Assels. 
Using colorful, earthy humor, 
Keeffe examines the disparity in 
British society between the working 
class, struggling to get along, and the 
upper class, using the establishment 
to further its own interests. Keeffe 
challenges the system which limits 
the attainment of money, 
possessions and power to the 
privileged few. 

There's Always 
Space for the 
New Expressionist. 

6 HiatU$ March 7, 1985 

Buddy, a 17-year-old young man 
from a poor, broken. working class 
family in East London is Keeffe's 
hero, who moves through the 
various strata of society on a 
cons iousness-raising quest. 
Arrested and imprisoned for stealing 
cars, Buddy accidently kills a prison 
warden four weeks before he is to be 
released from jail. Frightened by the 
consequences of his action, Buddy 
escapes from the prison and is 
befriended by a top government 
official , who has worked his way up 
from the slums to a position of 
wealth and power. Buddy soon finds 
himself spending his Christmas at a 
party in the posh home of a London 
socialite, where the talk centers 
around using government resources 
to increase personal assets. 

In this bitingly humorous social 
commentl,lry, Keeffe questions the 
inequality of justice in a society in 
which laws can both protect and 
exploit, depending on who holds the 
hy to power. 

'T.his play raises the idea that the

people whom society does not call 
criminals, those in positions of 
power, may be, in fact, more 
criminal than the people they do call 
criminals," Greif explains. "Keeffe 
docs not judge the wealthy and the 
powerful, saying he's a good guy and 
hl!'s a bad guy. Instead, he asks the 
audience to reevaluate what their 
ideals once were and to consider the 
questions, 'How did you g.et rich? At

* * * The second Graduate Repertory 
production, Shachiapang, is an 
adaptation of a Shanghai opera, 
Sparks Amid Ihe Reeds, which 
recounts China's struggle for 
liberation in the late 1930s. The 
presentation of this opera in Peking 
in 1964 marked a major 
achievement in revolutionary 
Chinese drama, with its unique 
combining of a contemporary theme 
with traditional opera convention. 

For the UCSD production, 
director Jon Dichter has 
collaborated with playwriting 
student Oana-Marie Hock to adapt 
the opera to a setting during the 
Vietnam War, a context which they 
believe is more readily identifiable 
by Americans. 

The graduate students comprising 
the casts for these repertory 
productions are: Dianne Berry, 
Hector Correa, Philip Curry, Tom 
Glynn, Corey Hansen, Marceline 
Hugot, Miki Kim, Mariangelo Pino, 
F.J. Pratt and Christopher 
Randolph. This production shows 
March 13, 15 and 17.
