Baca, Banks Will 
Speak at' Cultural 
Unity Day PrograDl 

By Meg Honda 
Noted 'Chicano activist Herman Baca and Indian educator 

Denis Banks will be here tomorrow to participate in UCSD's 
second annual Cultural Unity Day of Awareness. 

Baca has been a. prime organizer of Chicano communities in 
San Diego and Southern California and regularly works against 
"the gross violations of human rights of undocumented 
workers." 

Banks, president of an American Indian ' University near 
Davis, was a participant in the WoundE!d Knee Indian takeover 
in the mid-'70s . He remains one of the foremost American · 
I ndian activists. 

Both along with SDSU Black Studies Department 
"':hairwoman Shirley Weber and former United Farm Workers 
Vice President Philip Vera Cruz, will speak about "Native 
American Students at the University and Their Role in the 
Community," stressing "common rights in face of the increasing 
'new negativism' and positive steps that can be taken to 
implement effective countermeasures to combat human 
injustices. " 

According to Bill Morrow of the Native American Student 
Alliance, CUDA is a "social and political day dedicated to 
minorities or affirmative action groups on campus." It brings to 
campus, he says, a sampling of many diversified cultural 
traditions. There will be entertainment, food, and crafts 
representative of the Black, Chicano, American Indian and 
Asian cultures. 

The prime movers behind CUDA are the Black Student 
Union, the Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan 
(MECHA), the Native American Student Alliance and the 
Asian American Student Altiance. 

Among the sponsoring and funding orBanizations are the 
ASUCSD, "'hird-Lumumba/Zapata," Revelle, Muir and 
Warren CoileMes, and the Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs. 

CUDA wiU be held tomorrow at the east end 01 the Mandevilk 
Center Quad. Events begin lit 10:30 am and Ia!d until 5:30. 
Advanced tickets are $1.50 at the UCSD Box Office and $2 
Ihe day of the event.

Saxon Might Recommend 
Increase in Reg Fee Limit 

$50 More a Year Cited as Likely Figure 
By John Hondros 

Associate News Editor 
UC President David Saxon is thinking about 

recommending an increase in registra tion fees 
for next fall as an alternative to cutting services, 
a spokeswoman for Saxon says. 

The Board of Regents, in the final year of a 
three-year phased-in reg fee increase, are now 
beginning to consider systematic increases for 
next year. The present reg fee policy gives each 
campus the power to establish its own fee as 
long as the systemwide ceiling of $393 a year 
isn't exceeded. 

UCSD Reg Fee Chairwoman Liz Riley says 
she foresees a systemwide reg fee increase "if 
and only if we wish to preserve the status quo in 

. " services. 
UCSD's reg fee will increase next fall 

anyway to $393 regardless of systemwide 
action, according to Riley . . 

While some sources say the Regents would 
again be likely to phase in the increase over a 
three-year period, Riley says the UC student 
lobby is "pushing for" a one-yeaifee period. A 
one-year plan would allow tht. fee to keep pace 
with yearly cost of living increases, the lobby is 
arguing. 

If a systemwide i!lcrease does occur, Riley 
says it will probably be in the neighborhood of 
$50 a year. (She added that the $100 a year 
figure in the Los Angeles Times last week is 
"unreasonable" and "misleading") 

l}le-fee increase would be necessary to cover 
the rising costs of campus services due to 
inflation as well as "escalating" salary costs, 

claims Riley. Sixty-five percent of UCSD's reg 
fee monies goes toward salaries, she says. 

Riley says that UCSD and some of UC's 
smaller campuses may be contributing to the 
possible systemwide fee increase because of 
their declining enrollment. " Projections show 
that by 1981, UCSD's total enrollment will 
drop to 10,038 students. By 1982 we will be 
down to 10,000 - so a slight decrease is 
expected, although we're not as bad off as 
Riverside or Irvine." 

There are now about 11 :000 students here. 
"Students may not want to see a fee increase. 

but they will be infuriated if we (the Reg Fee 
Committee) cut out. some programs," says 
Riley. "In addition, there would be that problem 
of deciding what we should cut out." 

Tom Rutter, director of financial aid 
services, believes that a fee increase would still 
leave the University of California as the "best 
educational deal in the world." 

He quickly adds, however, that students 
probably perceive economics in a different way. 
"The fee structure does have an impact on the 
accessibility and choice of a campus for a 
student," he says. 

Rutter says that a fee increase could "force" 
more students into financial aid. (At present, 
about 4,000 students receive some sort of 
financial aid from the university) 
• Thus, he says, the competition for financial 
aid will increase.

'Sea Hunt' Just South of San Clemente 
Divers Research San Onofr'e's IDlpact on Sea 

By Sam Gooch 
Three miles south of San 

Clemente. the maaaive San 
Onofre Nuclear Generating 
Station squats at tht> shore's 
edge. 
Barely visible in the early 
morning fog, its three domes 
rise silently from the dense, 
moist air. 

Gooch, a Doily Guardian -
writer, is also a research diver 
at San Ono/re. fie wrote this 
storu under a,grant from the 
UCSD Student Center (or 
Undergraduate Research and 
Innovcition. The Hcond part o( 
Gooch's stotiJ' will appear 
Monday. 

A mile out to sea, beneath 
50 feet of frigid ocean, three 
divers hover around a bio· 
collection platfonn" swalling 
the dark, cloudy ' water with 
gloved handa in an effort to 
remain stable against the push 
and pull of the surge. On the 
..... ace above them, a 20 foot, 
twin inboard-outboard 
work boat, fully outfitted for 
research diving, slowly circles 
the 'divers' bubbles, waiting 
like a benevolept vulture to 
pluck the three biologists from 
the cold when they surface. 

All of this may IOUnd like a 
scene from the James Bond or 
Sea Hunt genre, but both the 
action and the setting 
accurately describe the 
abnosphere at San Onofre, 
where one of the most 
extensive and costly 
environmental impact studies 
ever undertaken is now in 

pr~ess. 
There are really two nuclear 

plants at San Onofre: the 
main, two-reactor facility 
(Units 2 aM 3) presently 
under ~ and due to 

day's first hints of life: a lone 
gull quietly skims the ocean's 
surface, popping up now and 
again with bits of breakfast in 
its beak; two miles off the 
coast, a 40-foot ketch crawls 
lazily back and forth over the 
swells, moving slowly north 
against the breeze. 

By early afternoon, the 
waters off San Onofre , 
especially the 14 miles south 
of the plants to Oceanside 
Harbor, are teeming with 
activity . Two nearby military 
bases - Camp Pendleton 
Marine and Miramar Air 
Force - dispatch helicopters 
that buzz and flap over the 
area all day long. Research 
divers, on their way in 

There too, floating conspicuously in the 
midst of modern vessels, are the 
sun-wrinkled, gnarly, lone fishermen 
be operationat" ea;ly in 1981, 
and the smaller Unit 1, a full-
function, 456-megawatt plant 
thai has been generating 
electrical power since 1968. 

Both plants, owned and op-
erated by Southern California 
Edison of los AnHelea, are 
"pressurized water nuclear 
reactors, a design in ~hich 
ocean water pumped into the 
cooling system never comes in 
contact with the reactors. 

It is the intake and 
discharge of seawater used in 
the cooling system that has 
spawned the multi ·million 
dollar research project.s, most 
of which relate to the 
indigenous kelp populations 
and their attending food 
chains. Scientists are 
interested in the consequences 
of increased "turbidity" in the 
area and the nature and extent 
of "thermal pollution" (the 
positive and negative effects of 
increasing the local water 
temperature by a few 
degrees). Both the turbidity -
the heavy sedimentation -
and the higher temperatures 
result from the exchange of 
seawater uled in the cooling 
process. 

San Onofre. The warmth of 
the morning sun gen tJy nudges 
away the fog, revealing the 

workboats to and from San' 
Onofre, and launching ports in 
Oceanside often see rolling 
schools of dolphin, and during 
the grey whale migrating 
seasons the divers are 
sometimes escorted by pods of 
spouting Leviathans. 

The stretch between San 
Onofre and Oceanside also 
hosts schools of ships and 
boats: huge, grey Navy ships 
with their smaller escorts and 
amphibious shuttles; 60-foot 
commercial sportfishersi and 
sleek, bright sail and motor 
pleasure crafts . 

There too, f1oatin'g 
conspicuously in the midst of 
modern vessels, are the sun-
wrinkled, gnarly, lone 
fishermen, resolutely working 
their gill nets and lobster traps. 

Most of the research 
programs at San Onofre fit 
into one of two categories: 
those that are carried out from 
the ocean's surface and those 
that require divers who work in 
depths ranging from a few feet 
below the surface to oner 100 
feet. Although almost a ll of the 
university-funded researchers 
as well as most private firms 
have programs that require 
both above and below surface 
research, several specialize in 
ei ther on or the other. 

Two private organizations, 
lockheed Marine Labs and 
Solana Beach's Marine 
Ecological Consultants, along 
with UC Santa Barbara's 
"fish Program, " are 
conducting surface based 
studies to determine the 
distribution and abundance of 
several fish species. They also 
monitor plankton and are 
evaluating a unique fish return 
system to protect the tons of 
fish that are drawn into the 
larger reactors intake and 
destroyed each year. 

To carry out these and other 
programs, res/archers employ 
sonar topographical survey· 
ing, plankton netting and 
beach seining. Data on winds, 
currents, temperature 
variations, wave patterns and 
other physical phenomena 'are 
matched with biological 
information to determine 
correlations between physical 
forcel and the local ecology. 

The research carried out 
from the surface of the ocean is 
of vital importance to the total 
research plan, but the more ' 
adventurous underwater 
projects are just as crucial. 
Diving crews - on some days 
as many as two dozen divers 
working from six or seven 
boats - perform a variety of 
underwater tasks. Their daily 
routines include transplanting, 
tagging and measuring kelp 
plants , doing topographical 
and biological surveys, taking 
readings from light and 
temperature recording 
instruments, and maintaining 
experimental stations. 

Each of aboui ten 
underwat er ex perim en ts 
requires its own specialized 
structure and instrumentation. 
They involve co lle c tin g 
organisms, measuring light 
levels and te mpera ture 
changes and monitoring kelp 
growth. 

One of the more interesting 
experiments is the UC's 
"natural recruitment station,"' 
designed to collec t kelp 
sporophytes and gametophyt-
es at various depths in the 
water column. The station has 
three independent structures 
spaced about 40 fee t apart, 
each of which has five 
collecting platforms floating 
one on top of another, all 

connected by a single cable 
running through the center. 
These "totem racks, " as they 
are nicknamed, are anchored 
in 50 feet of water and rise to 
within five feet of the surface. 
Although underwater visibility 
is usually very poor, on a rare 
clear day it's inspiring to watch 
several aquanauts majesti-

operating at full capaci ty. 
Much of the sedimenta tion 
drifts down over the kelp 'beds 
in giant, c urrentform ed 
plumes. 

The cold is an additional 
adversary of San Onofre 
divers. In the winter, with 
water temperatures in the low 
50s and the air that cold or 
colder, the divers remain 
shivering a nd blue-lipped a ll 
day long. Most of the divers 
are equipped with semi· dry 
suits that help to cut the cold 
consi der ab ly, but lon g 
immersion and fatigue often 
co'mbine to make diving an 
uncomfortable experience . 

. Still, a few of the more hardy of 
the divers brave it through the 
icy days in conventional 
wetsuits. 

Limited visibility, cold and 
heavy bottom surge can 
produce extremely disorien-
ting and dangerous working 
conditions. Although there has 
never been a serious diving 
accident at San Onofre since 
the research be~an, there ha ve 
been a few t~nse situation!!, 
some that could have ended in 
di!!aster if the divers involved 
had not been thoroughly 
professional with regard to 
salety and experience. Masks 
have been ripped from faces, 
regulators torn from mouths, 
and lin es wrapped a l)()ut 
extremities when the divt:rs 

and They wrestle strong currents 
sometimes succumb to fatigue from the 
cold . 
cally hovering among the 
totem racks, dancing through 
one another's bubbles, some 01 
the divers Roating slowly 
upward, others drifting silently 
toward the cobbled sea floor. 

The majority of the divers 
are also biologists, spending 
many hours each week 
analyzing experimental data . 
Many of them dive two or 
three days per weeki the rest of 
the time they work with 
microscopes or computers, 
conduct laboratory experi. 
ments and write reports. 

A handful of freelancers. 
affectionately called "rent·a-
divers" and who smiringly 
refer to themselves as "aqua· 
consultants," regularly 
accompany the San Onofre 
diving crews. 

Underwater conditions that 
the divers must deal with vary 
considerably Ir9m day to day, 
but they can usually expect 
poor visibility regardless of the 
weather. On many dives , the 
sea floor is felt before it is seen; 
sometim s it isn 't seen at all. 
"Mud diving" is how many of 
the divers have described it. 
On most days, though, 
visibility is better further off-
shore. There clarity on the 
bottom averages fiv e to seven 
feet. 

In addition to the many 
natural variables that caust: 
poor visihility ,the construction 
of Units 2 and 3 contributes to 
the problem; dredgin!! and 
gravel dumping operations do 
much to inhibit visibility. The

Oil Prices to Rise? Kr~p~Q~iJ~_i;_abinet film Strike Progress 
BELGRADE, Yugoslavia - Saudi Arabia's 
finance minister issued a stern warning yesterday 
that unless the decline in the dollar is halted, his 
government may take action that could further drive 
up the price of oil. 

"It would be naive to pretend that a continuous 
erosion of our financial resources, through inflation 
and e xchange depreciation, could not provoke a 
reaction," Sheikh Mohamed Abalkhail told a 
meeting here of the International Monetary fund and 
the World Bank. 

But Abalkhail also said Saudi Arabia is prepared 
to participate in a consumer.producer dialogue on oil 
prices and supply, something the US has long sought. 

A US official, informed of the minister's speech, 
said the matter would be explored further with Saudi 
Arabia. " I think it's a new initiative," added Richard 
Cooper, the US undersecretary of state for economic 
affairs. . 

Fraudulent Churchill 
LONDON - Winston Churchill's famous "We shall 
fight on the beaches .. . We shall fight in the hills ... We 
shall never surrender" speech was broadcast to the 
world June 4, 1940 by a ac tor impersonating him, 
the British Broadcasting Corp. confirmed yesterday. 

Churchill delivered the stirring speech to the House 
of Commons that day, and recorded it much later 
along with his other major speeches. 

But on June 4, Churchill was preoccupied with the 
Dunkirk evacuation and the Impending fall of the 
french government to Nazi Germany. 

He was too busy to record the speech, so the job 
went to BBC repertory actor Norman Shelley, now 76 
who told the Lonc/on Daily Moil how it h<tppened. 

A SPECIAL EVENTI 

WASHINGTON - Juanita M. Kreps, the nat ion 's 
first female secretary of commerce, submi tted her 
resignation to President Carter Wednesday. a 
Commerce Department spokesman said. 

Kreps cited "personallamily reasons" for leaving 
the cabinet job, according to Commerce spokesman 
Ernest loti 10, who added: "She feels she has been 
away from her family for almost three year ' and al 
this time needs to be with them." 

He said that the White Hous planned to officially 
announce today thai Carter was accepting the 
resignalion with regret. 

In Durham, N.C. , Duke Chancellor A . Kenneth 
Pye said that Kreps would return to the university 
Nov. 1. She has been on leave from her job as a 
university vice-president and economics prolessor_ 

Kreps has been seriously considering returning to 
Durham since late June because of her husband's 
health problems, said a source, who asked for 
anonymity. 

Yale to Cut Faculty 
NEW HAVEN - Sixteen to 35 positions in the a rts 
and sciences faculty at Yale University may have to 
be eliminated next year to reduce Yale 's budlfet 
deficit, Yale provost Georlfe May says. 

Yale wants a $700,000 rl!dudion in the payroll of 
the arts and sciences faculty , he said. "This is the size 
of the cut we will have to make for the faculty of arts 
and sciences 10 meet their share a t balancing the 
budget," May said Tuesday. 

He said Yale hoped to e liminate the positions 
through attrition. The reduction, however, would 
make it more difficult for junior faculty members to 
gain tenure.

We Got Jesus, Yes 
We Do, We Got Jesus, 
How About You? 
NEW YORK - About -19,000 teen-agers in Madison 
Square Garden gave the pope a guitar, a "Big Apple" T-shirl 
a pair of blue jeans and a rising, roaring welcome Wednesday 
at a youth celebration that was a combination rock concert 
and basketball pep rally_ 

They greeted him with pulsating jungle drums that usually 
bring the home team hustling out of the locker room in a big 
basketball tournament_ 

1ben the rafters exploded in an air-spliting thunder of 
ahouta and whistles as the pope circled the arena in his pope-
mobile to the rock beat of Space Shurtle and Bartle Star 
Galoc:tica themea, played by the l00-piece band of 
Brooldyn's St. Francis Prep. 

When Pope John Paul II lifted a tiny blonde girl from a box 
seat in his strong arms and placed her on top of the vehicle's 
cab, the young people from 200 Reman Catholic high 
schools in the metropolitan area commenced the rhythmic 
chant: "Long live the pope, long live the pope." . 

The Theme 'rom Superman, delivered with blaring, brassy 
gusto by the almost all-black Cardinal Spellman High School 
band serenaded the pope on his way to the throne set up on 
the pedestal just below the basketball scoreboard thai was lit 
up with the words: 

"Holy Father, we wekome you to our city in your pursuit 
of human dignity for all." 

In the foot·stomping, cheering crowd, many young peoplt! 
had tears of ecstacy running down their faces. Several were 
carried out in a faint. 

Already so far behind in his schedule thatlhe youth concert 
had to begin without him, the 59-year-old pontiiltried several 
times to start his short speech but was continually interrupted 
by still another burst of cheering from still anolher high school 
far up in the balcony. 

One refrain came over loud and clear. "Wrack 'em up 
stack 'em up, bust 'em in two. Holy Father, we're for you.': 

Amen

Women's V-ball Mettle Shown on Road 
By Ray Seva 

The toughest test of a 
team's character, it is said. is 
when a team must travel for a 
game-away from familiar 
surroundings, away from fans 
and friends. 

On the road the past 
weekend, the women ' s 
volleyball team found ou t a 
little bit about its character, 
and it appears to be a winning 
one. 

Playing in a bracket with a 
few larger Division II schools 
in the tournament at La Verne 
College, the UCSD women 
fought their way to a 5-5 
record. A few points gathered 
here a nd there, however, 
boosted them to a third place 
finish. 

The UCSD women stl:lrted 
off the lournament by beating 
Division II power Cal State 
Dominguez Hills. Though Ihe 
two teams split the games 12-
15 and 15-11', UCSD was 
dedared the winner. The rules 

, 

of the tourmlment stClted that 
in a split. the s<:hool that 
smred the most points during 
the match is the winner . So 
UCSD won, 27-26. This was 
the only loss for Dominguez 
Hills, the tournament winner. 

Next, the UCSD women 
found themselves up against a 
much stronger women's team 
from Biola, and lost, 15-2, 15-
5 . UCSD coach Doug 
Dannevik offered no ex<:use 
for the defeat. " They' re just a 
lot more powerful than we 
are," said Dannevik_ 
. The third opponent for the 

UCSD women was the 
University of Redlands . As 
with Dominguez Hills, the 
UCSD women split with 
Redlands. UCSD lost the first 
game. 15-10, but took the 
second 15-7. for another 
"split" victory . 

Next on the UCSD slate 
was Westmont. The UCSD 
women swept the two "ames 
15-13 and 15- 11_ ., ,

The final opponent in the 
round-robin tournament for 
the UCSD women was 
another Division II school. Ihe 
University of Nevada urs 
Vegas. UCSD again won with 
a split of the two games with 
the Rebel ,. 12-15, and 15-1 I. 

The last statement seems to 
illustrate the team 's season 
thus far . " We're nol playing 
consistenlly enoll1!h for one 
girl to be able to outshine the 
others." he said. 

Hdh Prather havl' done 1\\,11 
def ensively . Ish (Ann 
I shihar a) has set rea II)' well. 
and EI<line Ik ... gmillln has 
done well up front. And Cheryl 
Wri!-(ht has done well, too . We 
call her "Mom" lJecause she's 
the one who takes \;m e and 
looks out for us all. She has it . 
steadying influence on the 
Ip,am .' · 

The women finished the 
tourney behind only Biola and 
Dominguez Hills . Coach 
Dannevik was especially 
proud of the team's win over 
Dominguez Hills. 

In the ea rly going, however, 
Dannevik points oul that a lew 
girls ha ve excelled <It cert<lin 
points. 

"So far , Cara Churchill and 

San Onofre Research 
After the tournament, the 

UCSD women hit the road 
again, this time for it league 
makh against the University 
of Redlands Tuesday. UCSD 
came out on lop, fighling to a 
15-13. 16-14, 15- 11 sweep. 
using only the six women who 
went. 

Continued (rom pelle 2 
underwater al San Onofre. 

Despite the mid and lhe 
occasional danger. most of the 
divers enjoy their work. 

" They all played extremely 
well. Ann Ishihara set the ball 
heautifully tonight. Cara 
(Churchill) and Sherre (Lilley) 
also served well tonight, " sHid 
Dannevik. 

.But the sharks are there, 
itn" the divers know it. Blues. 
Ihreshers, and hitmmerheads 
have all heen spoiled from the 
surf<lce. and San Onofre is jusl 
as vulnerable as any other 
stretch of Southern California 
coastline to malevolent visits 
from the grei,t white shmk. 

Why '? Presumable because 
of the joh's many pleasant 
aspects: two hour decompress-
ion intervals, during which 
there is plenty of time to relax 
and tan under a warm slIIJlrner 
sun; fishing during lunch 
breaks; just being out (m the 
ocean as opposed 10 cramped 
in a stuffy office. 

As with mosl things there is 
usually the hright side - and 
so it is with an Onofre.

'Feel the Night' Follows Jazz Trend 
By Sid Corbett 

One of the most interesting 
musical developments in the 
1970. has been the renewed 
popularity of jazz. While this 
surge in interest is largely due 
to the stagnant, overproduced, 
and generally directionless 
sound of today', rock, this 
"renaissance" has alia been 
fostered by the conscious 
effort of jazz players to make 
their music palatable to a 
broader listening audience. 
Lee Ritenour, a prominent 
contemporary jazzman, has 
taken a significant step in that 
direction with his third and 
latest LP, Feel the Nigh/. 

Lee Ritenour's brand of jazz 
features a slick, tight and 
well( not over) prod uced 
sound. With help from an 
exceptio{laJ crew of top studio 
players which he calls 
Friendship, he 's made 
considerable headway on the 
L.A. jazz scene during the last 
three years . Ritenour is so 
content with Friendship that he 
has recently produced an 
album of that name upon 
which he appears. After 
rehearsal for his recent 

~rformance at L.A.'s Greek 
Theatre, Ritenour discussed 
his musical directions, as well 
as his plans for the immediate 
future with Friendship. 

.. Friendship", says 
Ritenour, "is the most exciting 
project I've been involved 
with." This statement is 
especially notable in light of his 
recent Bay Area concert with 
Joni Mitchell, Stanley Clarke 
and Randy Brecker. 

Asked about the more 
conservative stance which 
Feel the Night seems to take, 
the guitarist replied, "Well, the 

album is definitely an attempt 
at wider appeal. but I don't 
think that music is sacrificed 
really . I would agree," he 
continues, "that the music is 
less intellectually or 
technically motivated than 
R.T.F. for example, but that 
isn't where our heads are at 
anyway." 

Feel the Night seems to be a 
good indication of where his 
music does stand. The a lbum 
features some of his finest solo 
playing on disc , however 
unlike his previous two 
releases , this album a lso 
reveals. the musicians' great 
versatility as a composer, 
arranger and producer. The 
songs blend diversity with 
balance . 

"Midnight Lady" is a soft 
acoustic work which could 
easil~ have found its way onto 
an Earl Klugh album. The 
song is just one of many 
available examples on the 
a lbum of Ernie Watts' inspired 
saxwork. Of bassist 
Abraham Laboriel, Ritenour 
boasts , "I have never played 
with one betler." Friendship 
which appeared at the Greek 
last month featured Alex 
Acuna, once with Weather 
Report. on drums. However , 
drummer Steve Gadd 
performs in the studio. 

The general tone of the 
album is a fast paced latin-
influenced boogie over which 
Ritenou.r, Watts, and 
keyboardist Don Grusin add 
dexterous bop-fusion solos. 
The most satisfying pieces on 
the album, "Market Place" 
and th e title cut, are in this 
vein_ Structurally, th e 
compositions are much less

complex and sophisticated 
than those which characteriz-
ed his first two albums, 
Captain Fingers and The 
Captain's Journey. However , 
the slick orchestration , 
induding very effective use of 
brass, combined with the 
flashy solo work make this 
album in many ways his most 
enjoyable yet. Even Leo 
Sayer's "You Make Me Feel 
Like Danc in ' ," the most 

obvious example of the 
guitarists' commercial drive. is 
tolerable again largely due to 
the brass arrangement. Palli 
Austin's vocal work was 
certainly no de trim e nt, 
although perhaps slight ly out 
of place_

Local interviews 
for software professionals 
The purpose of every Wang product is the same: 
to enhance productivity 

At Wang Laboratories, we make computer and word processing systems. 
But we're really not in the computer or word processing business. 

Our business is productivity. And that's a people business. 

Because it's people who produce. Machines just make it easier. 
-

Maybe all this sounds obvious. But you'd be surprised how many com-
puter and word processing manufacturers forget that the end users of 
their products are people. 

At Wang, we never forget. 

That's why our products are simpler to use than theirs. And more 
efficient. 

And that's why we're growing faster than anybody else in the business. 

And that's why we're interested in Bachelor's, Master's or PhD 
candidates.
