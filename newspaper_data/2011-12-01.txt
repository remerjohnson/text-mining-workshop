StudentsÊtoÊVoteÊonÊD-IÊSports

Students may soon be voting on the fate of UCSD athletics, after 
A.S. Council approved 
the Division I Athletics 
Referendum last night with 
an overwhelming vote of 

27-1-1. If 
passed, the 
referendum 
would raise 
student fees 
by $165 per 
student per 

quarter, grossing the $16 mil-
lion necessary for the ath-
letic teams to move to, and 
be competitive in, Division I. 
   Now that council has 
passed the measure, the ref-
erendum will move to Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Penny Rue for approval. 
After she approves the ini-
tiative, the referendum will 
move to Chancellor Marye 
Anne Fox and then to the 
UC Office of the President.      
     The referendum will then 
move to a student vote in 
a special election that A.S. 
President Alyssa Wing said 
she hopes to hold in Winter 
Quarter 2012. 

“It’s not A.S. [Council’s] 
job to say if we should or 
should not move to D-I,” 
Wing said. “What we should 
focus on is [whether] the 
language is appropriate for 
students to vote on. We have 
made changes [to the lan-

guage of the referendum]. We 
are trying to cover all our 
grounds before we hit UCOP 
so that it is something we are 
confident will pass.”

Athletics Director Earl 
Edwards, who spoke at 
the council meeting on 
Wednesday, Nov. 30, said the 
move to Division I is a great 
opportunity for UCSD.

“It’s really encouraging to 
see that students really care 
about campus and society as 
a whole,” he said. “We would 
be in a conference with many 
of our sisters, like UCR, UCI, 
UCSB. They’re doing it the 
right way in the context of 
being student-athletes.”

In Spring Quarter 2010, 
A.S. Council hired an athlet-
ics consultant to evaluate the 
feasibility of a football team 
and moving to Division I. 

The consultant advised 
council to pursue the move 
to Division I without adding 
a football team. 

For this to occur, the 
absolute minimum increase 
needed for the move to D-I 
is $4.8 million, the consultant 
said, but a minimum $13 mil-
lion is necessary in order to 
be competitive.

“We don’t want to be a 
university that is only in D-I 
but is not competitive,” Wing 
said. “We want to be able 
to provide scholarships [for] 

Referendum, if passed by students, would 
increase student fees by $165 per quarter

No Fee 
Increase 
in 2012-13
BY ZEV HURWITZ
Staff Writer

UC President Mark G. Yudof 
announced at a UC Board of Regents 
meeting held Monday, Nov. 28 that 
tuition at the 10 UC campuses will not 
increase this year, as long as the sys-
tem can attain additional funds from 
the state government. At the meeting, 
held via teleconference on four UC 
campuses, the Regents passed a budget 
that will seek $2.7 billion from state 
government — an increase of nearly 
$400 million from 2011-12. 

“We must send an expenditure-
only budget to Sacramento,” Yudof 
said. “If there is no increase in state 
funding, we will find other ways to 
increase revenue.”

Yudof told students and faculty 
during the UC Regents meeting — 
held at the UC Merced, UC Davis, 
UCLA and UCSF campuses via tele-
conference — that a tuition increase 
would only be possible if lawmakers 
in Sacramento are unable to close a 
$3-billion budget gap. He also said 
that if state government does not fulfill 
the requested funding, the UC system 
would increase enrollment by 1 per-
cent and increase lobbying efforts in 
Sacramento. 

“Raising tuition is not critical,” 
Yudof said. “No increase was ever on 
the agenda for this meeting.”

A crowd of UC students, alumni 
and faculty used the opportunity to 
protest against police brutality and 
higher fees. According to “Student pro-
tests disrupt meeting of UC regents,” 
published Nov. 29 in the Los Angeles 
Times, protesters in attendance on 
three campuses shouted loudly and 
chanted, “We need to make UC public 
again,” forcing the Regents present to 
relocate to continue the meeting. 

UCLA graduate student Cheryl 
Deutsch, who is president of the state-
wide union that represents teaching 
assistants accused the Regents of hav-
ing purely financial goals.

“You are not representatives of the 
people of California, and you are not 
representatives of the students of the 
UC,” Deutsch said. “You are the one 
percent...You ought to be ashamed of 
yourselves.”

As part of a systemwide one-day 
strike in response to the Nov. 18 
pepper spray incident at UC Davis, 
People’s Assembly at UCSD organized 
a “Study Out” encampment in front of 
Geisel Library. Marshall College senior 
Kevin Quirolo, a member of People’s 
Assembly, said that the approximately 
25 students who were participating

top-notch talent [that we] want to 
come to our campus. The number 
is a little higher than the projection, 
but that is to maintain our program 
and ensure that we don’t have to keep 
going back to students with more 
referendums.”

Of the $16 million revenue, 
approximately $5.5 million (34 per-
cent) will go toward athletic schol-
arships. The rest will be divided 
among areas such as administrative 
operations and salaries, coach sala-
ries and team operations. 

Additionally, 29 percent of the 
fee will contribute to a return-to-
aid, to help compensate students 
who are dependent on financial 
aid and not able to afford the fee 
increase.

“I don’t foresee the California 
budget changing dramatically in the 
next few years and we do have this 
opportunity to vote for D-I right 
now,” Wing said. “I would say that 
right now is the time to capitalize on 
it and agree on it.”

Last year, UCSD applied for a 
position in the Big West Division I 

conference, but was rejected in favor 
of the University of Hawaii. 

Even if the referendum is 
passed in the winter election, the 
fee increase will not be initiated 
unless UCSD is invited to partici-
pate in the Big West conference. 

The language of the referen-
dum also ensures that the fee 
will only be collected starting 
up to one year prior to UCSD’s 
first scheduled Division I match 
and that the referendum will be 
void if UCSD has not received a 
bid from the Big West conference 
by 2014. 

UCSD has been in Division II 
for over 10 years. 

The initiative to move toward 
Division I began when 2009-10 
A.S. President Utsav Gupta, then 
a Campuswide Senator, created 
the Football Feasibility Task Force 
in 2007. 

At the Nov. 30 meeting,  some 
constituents spoke out against the 
move to Division I.

“Some will argue that it’s a short-
term pain for a long-term gain, but 
that’s a decades-long proposition,” 

Sixth College senior and former 
Sixth College Senator John Condello 
said. “This means more referenda 
not only for the move to D-I, but 

also to fund 
the sport peo-
ple actually 
pay for: foot-
ball.”

Associate 
Vice President 
of Student 
Organizations 
L y n n e 
S w e r h o n e 
was strongly 
against the 
measure, and 
a n n o u n c e d 
her resigna-
tion after 
c o u n c i l 
passed the 
referendum. 

“ C h e c k 
your fucking privilege, you all have 
the time to be here,” Swerhone said. 
“The only reason I can be here is 
because I get paid. We are the 1 per-
cent at UCSD. You are the 1 percent 

that is privileged to be here.”
Vice President of External Affairs 

Samer Naji said that he could no 
longer support Division I, though 
it had been a component of his 
platform while campaigning during 
elections season last year. 

“I can no longer support that 
position,” Vice President of External 
Affairs Samer Naji said. “This has 
been a long and hard decision for 
me and it’s not easy to do. For the 
athletic community, I apologize, but 
for the students that cannot afford 
it, I stand behind you.”

With the referendum moving 
into the next stages of approval, it is 
closer to being put up for a student 
vote.

“I want to remind students that 
the biggest power that you have is 
to cast your vote and say whether 
or not you want your university to 
go in that direction,” Wing said. 
“Now we are faced with a decision, 
just like the movement from D-III 
to D-II.”

About Chapman University
Chapman University is one of California’s oldest 

and most respected private universities. Tracing its 

heritage to 1861—and celebrating that 150-year-

old heritage throughout 2011—the university now 

excels in the sciences, business, law, humanities, 

educational studies, fi lm and media arts, and 

performing arts.

The last A.S. meeting of the quarter was met with passion, debate and a high student 
attendance rate that forced some into 
the hallway.

Since Associate Vice President 
of Local Affairs and council Speaker 
Ryan O’Rear submitted his formal 
resignation on Nov. 27, Associate Vice 
President of Diversity Affairs Jesus 
Romero stepped 
up to the mic for 
the night.

F o r m e r 
Associate Vice 
President of Local 
Affairs Aries 
Yumul urged 
council to seriously consider the 
applicants for the position.

Afterward, over 10 constituents 
addressed council regarding the reso-
lution supporting the Reclaim UC 
movement.

“We stem from the Occupy move-
ment, but we’re standing against fee 
increases and police brutality,” Sixth 
College sophomore Savini Ganhewa 
explained. “I think we’re all in agree-
ment that we don’t want those fee 
increases, and Cal States just got a fee 
increase so we’re next.”

Others put more pressure on 
council to support the issue.

“I’m here, not to urge or ask, but 
to demand that you stand in support 
of the resolution supporting ‘Reclaim 
UC,’” sociology graduate student 
Nikolai Smith said. “You [should] do 
what people in democratic positions 
are supposed to do, and support your 
constituents.”

Not all were in support of the reso-
lution, however.

“I am here to remind everyone 
that the neutrality statement wasn’t 
about supporting or not supporting 
history,” Roosevelt College senior 
student Daniel Friedman said. “The 

neutrality statement was to say that if 
it’s going to divide our campus, it’s not 
really our cause.”

With no objections, the resolution 
passed.

Nearly the same amount of stu-
dents spoke regarding the referendum 
for a $165-per-quarter fee increase for 
UCSD to move to Divison I athletics.

“I am in support for a move to D-I, 
but not right now 
and not on this 
price tag,” Sixth 
College senior 
John Condello 
said. “We have 
students dropping 
out and living out 

of their cars, and now you’re talking 
about a referendum.”

Others focused on the positives 
a D-I atmosphere would bring to 
UCSD.

“These are really hard decisions, 
but having a really bomb D-I bas-
ketball team, football, soccer, would 
increase diversity and the campus cli-
mate,” Marshall College senior Darryl 
Baskerville said.

The referendum passed with an 
open-ballot vote of 27-1-1, prompting 
Associate Vice President of Student 
Orgs Lynne Swerhone to resign.

And, of course, let’s not forget 
the winner of this week’s prestigious 
Councilmember of the Week sash 
and strut, Associate Vice President of 
Concerts and Events Oliver Zhang! 
He opted out of a strut in favor of a 
high-five run around the horseshoe of 
A.S. Council tables.

Engineering Senator Parminder 
Sandhu was sad to report that his 
Engineering-on-a-Stick event, orig-
inally scheduled to take place this 
week, was postponed.

“I cried a lot of tears,” he 
said. “You cannot see them 
because they are already shed.”

were demonstrating for a number of 
issues, including an end to police bru-
tality and an increased student voice in 
university decisions.

“Our position right now, even 
though tuition fees have been tabled, is 
that we need more student representa-
tion on the [UC] Board of Regents,” 
Quirolo said. “We don’t have much say 
in how the university is run, regardless 
[of] how much we’re paying.”

Quirolo also said that while 
student leaders at UC Davis had 
only called for a one-day strike, the 
“Study Out” will likely remain func-
tional for the rest of the week. 

Chairman of the UC Board of 
Regents Sherry Lansing moderated 
the UC Regents meeting. Lansing 
allowed over an hour of public com-
ment.

UC Berkeley graduate student 
Charlie Eaton criticized UC admin-
istrators for their “poor judgment” 
in financial decisions.

“It’s a sign that the bankers 
and millionaires on the Board of 
Regents are out of touch with what 
Californians want from our univer-
sity system,” he said.

Lansing announced that the 
regents will be visiting each campus 
over the next few weeks to meet with 

student leaders.
“We can use our voices and your 

voices,” Lansing said.
A date has not been set for the 

UC Regents’ visit to UCSD.

Empowerment” project in 2010 which 
focused on providing students with 
affordable access to birth control. 
The first part of Elman’s project cul-
minated with the installation of the 
Price Center machines, which were 
installed in Spring Quarter 2011 with 
support from University Centers.

According to Associate Vice 
President of Student Services Leigh 
Mason, the machines have generated 
a positive response from students. 
      “We stocked at the end of spring 
quarter, and when we came back 
in fall they were empty,” Mason 
said. “We’ve restocked twice 
[this year]. Over one weekend the 
machines were completely sold out.” 
      Mason said that the Office of 

Student Services, in collabora-
tion with Student Health Services, 
hoped to expand Elman’s proj-
ect to ERC in a pilot project to 
assess student use within colleges. 
      “We don’t want to spend money 
unless it’s a success,” Mason said. 
          Mason said the project’s long-term 
goals are to expand condom machines 
within every college and in the sec-
ond-floor Price Center restrooms.    
     According to Mason, each machine 
costs roughly $200 and a pair of con-
doms costs 25 cents. 

The machines will be 
restocked by A.S. Council to 
keep the service sustainable.                         
  “The only maintenance would 
be the one-time investment of 
the machines and support from 

Housing and Dining,” Mason said. 
    If Housing, Dining and Hospitality 
approves the project, condom 
machines will likely be installed 
under Café Ventanas and potentially 
in I-House, Mason said. 

The Office of Student Services plans 
to draft up a proposal for Housing 
and Dining to review next quarter. 
 “Other universities already have 
condom machines,” Mason said. “It 
was surprising that UCSD didn’t.” 
     As part of Student Health Services’ 
contribution to the project, the con-
dom machines in ERC will have 
pamphlets with information on STD 
screening and sexual health sessions.

D-I Athletics: A Lasting     
Investment

UCSD athletics is growing out of  its Division II standing — prompting the 
question of  whether students are willing to fund a movement to Division I. 

Ladies and gentlemen, pre-meds and comparative literature majors, it’s time for a special election. And while 
our student body has been less than 
enthusiastic about campus politics 
— 25-percent turnout rate, anyone? 
— this winter’s likely vote is one that 
everyone should be paying attention 
to; should it pass, all of us will be pay-
ing an additional $165 per quarter for 
Division I sports as soon as UCSD is 
accepted into the Big West conference. 

It’s been four years since then-
Campuswide Senator (and later 
2009-10 President Utsav Gupta) 
created the Football Feasibility Task 
Force and started seriously evaluating 
an underexposed aspect of UCSD: 
sports. Four presidents, one “student 
interest” survey and a $20,000 athletic 
consultant report later, football is still 
a ridiculously expensive pipe dream, 
but moving to Division I is just on 
the horizon. Last night, A.S. Council 
passed, 27-1-1,  the referendum that 
would allow students to vote on 
whether to institute the aforemen-
tioned fee; now it’s up to students to 
weigh the options. 

At the core of this highly divisive 
issue lie two opposing, and equally 
true, arguments. One is that UCSD 
deserves to be in Division I. The other 
is that UCSD is not a sports school. 
When it comes to the latter, signs of 
apathy are apparent at each game, at 
the continued lack of a football team, 
at the fact that few students even 
knew that our baseball and women’s 
soccer teams are some of the best in 
the nation, in D-II. Most students 
chose the school for the academics 
or location, not for the possibility 
of spending evenings crowded into 
bleachers, and as thus, care little about 
what we “could be” if we were to make 
the move. For the student who’s eager 
to get in, pass linear circuits and get 
out, paying extra money for “school 
spirit” and “athletic prestige” simply 
isn’t worth it.

Not to mention that, in all likeli-
hood, there’ll be little increase in this 
famed and elusive “school spirit” that 

UCSD is notorious for lacking. Unlike 
the temptation of a football team, a 
move to D-I does not provide anything 
concretely new that supporters can rally 
behind. Hordes of students are unlikely 
to start showing up  to games simply 
because the Roman numeral next to our 
ranking has changed, especially because 
we’ll be going from wins to losses for 
the first few seasons. Not to mention 
that the national radar of sports — and 
the corresponding alumni donations 
— are focused so heavily on football 
that there’s no guarantee that an overall 
move will rake in the cash. 

But despite all this, the university 
has already outstayed its welcome in the 
Division II California College Athletic 
Association division and the natural 
progression calls for us to move. Since 
we moved to Division II a decade ago, 
we’ve been the only UC school in the 
division other than Merced, and we’re 
evolving so quickly that our statistics 
don’t match with our competition. 
According to the 2010 Feasibility Study 
commissioned by A.S. Council, which 
cites 2008 enrollment figures, both our 
enrollment and our academic scores 
paint us as the odd one out.  Our cur-
rent competitors in the CCAAs are 
mostly Cal States; the CCAA average 
enrollment is 15,000 undergraduates, 
while we have nearly double that at 
28,000. Academically, the numbers 
are even more telling; the average 75th 
percentile verbal SAT score for CCAA 
is 528 — UCSD’s is 660. For math: 542. 
UCSD: 710. 

Over time, a stronger sports pro-
gram will bring the much-hoped-for 
prestige. There’s even a term for this 
phenomenon: the Flutie effect, named 
after Boston College’s Doug Flutie, 
whose 1984 football pass created an 
increase in applications to the univer-
sity in the next year. Two University of 
Virginia researchers conducted a 2008 
study showing that the effect is quantifi-
able; schools that make it to the Sweet 
16 in men’s basketball see a 3-percent 
boost in applications the following year, 
while the champion is likely to see a 7-

EDITORIAL

Not everyone thinks Christmas is the most wonderful time of the year — namely, Jews. 
While many grin and bear it during 

the holiday season, quietly celebrating 
Hanukkah as their neighbors erect 
1000-watt Santas in their front yards, 
some may want to avoid all the Jesus 
cheer (or at least capitalize on it). 
Here’s how:

1. Get your Scrooge on before 
the big day. If you make it really 
obvious to your neighbors that you 
hate Christmas, they’ll at least leave 
you out of the Christmas card pool. 
So when you start to hear caroling, 
place a prominent menorah in your 
window, turn the lights off and scowl. 
When your neighbors send out taste-
less Christmas-themed sugar cookies, 
refuse them if they aren’t kosher and 
then send them Hanukkah cookies so 
good they’ll think twice about their 
Christianity. And only RSVP to par-
ties that are non-denominational. 

2. Throw a rager. Show off 
your heritage to your non-religious 
friends — with alcohol. In other 
words, now is the time to throw the 
best Hanukkah party anyone has ever 
seen. Erect a shot glass menorah so 
you can do a fire shot for each night 
of the holiday, thereby making Jews 
look way more badass than any gen-
tiles you know. Break out bottles of 
Manischewitz and get trashed like it’s 
your cousin’s bar mitzvah. Only now 
you don’t have to write anyone a check 
for turning 13.

3. See movies way better than 
“Arthur Christmas.” Sure, this year’s 
requisite Christmas movie, “Arthur 
Christmas,” looks kind of cute. But as 
your Santa-loving friends are dragged 
to that movie during winter break 
with their families, you have an excuse 
to see better movies (Check our movie 
preview on page 6 for some ideas).

But it’d probably be wise to ditch 
the theatres entirely and set yourself 
up for a Jewish movie marathon 
on your couch. Watch the best in 
Jewish cinema — “Schindler’s List,” 
“Inglorious Bastards,” anything by 
Woody Allen or the Coen Brothers 
or starring Jerry Seinfeld, Natalie 
Portman, or Dustin Hoffman. 
Basically, the best in cinema. Period. 
Take that, “Polar Express.”

4. Be a better Jew. It’d be kind of 
hypocritical to knock on Christmas 
without fully appreciating your own 
heritage. After all, just as there’s more 
to Christmas than Santa Claus and 
department store sales, there’s more 
to Hanukkah than eight presents, gelt 
and dreidels. So use this time of year 
to actually go to synagogue for once. 
Break out your old mitzvah Torah and 
brush up on your Hebrew. Or, if you’re 
on the more secular side, at least delve 
into some Jewish history at the library 
or on Wikipedia.

Unlike Christmas, Hanukkah 
doesn’t have all the consumerism 
and overplayed lore to wear it out. 
Enjoy it while it lasts. And, most 
importantly, spend time with the 
best and worst part about being 
Jewish — your family.

THE MENTAL FISHBOWL By Alex Nguyen LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Dear Editor,
Today is World AIDS Day, a 

time when people around the world 
recognize the devastating toll that 
the HIV/AIDS epidemic has taken 
while also realizing the tremendous 
potential we have to bring the suffer-
ing to an end. The theme for World 
AIDS Day thisw year is “Getting 
to Zero”: zero new HIV infections, 
zero discrimination and zero AIDS-
related deaths. While this is a daunt-
ing challenge, it is entirely within our 
grasp to create the political, social 
and economic changes necessary to 
“get to zero.”

An outstanding scientific dis-
covery was made earlier this year: 
Giving antiretroviral drugs to HIV-
positive people can reduce transmis-
sion of the virus to their partners by 
96%. This startling breakthrough has 
finally allowed global health experts 
to begin to model the end of the 
HIV/AIDS crisis. However, these 
drugs often cost hundreds of dol-
lars per patient per year and require 
a lifetime of treatment. With more 
than 1.4 billion people worldwide liv-
ing in extreme poverty on less than 
$1.25 per day, antiretrovirals remain 
priced far outside the reach of the 
majority of patients in the developing 
world who need them.

How can we change this? Being 
engaged in university research helps: 
nearly one-third of all drugs used to 
treat AIDS originated in academic 
laboratories. Many of the other 
medicines were developed based on 
fundamental discoveries again aris-
ing from university research. If so 
many AIDS drugs came from work 
done on campuses like ours, and if 
our universities are committed to 
improving human welfare, then why 
can’t patients in low- and middle-

income countries afford the drugs we 
were so essential in developing? 

The problem arises when uni-
versities sell off their patent rights to 
potential medicines to pharmaceuti-
cal companies, which then advance 
them through clinical trials all the 
way to regulatory approval. The 
University of California has been 
quite successful at selling its innova-
tions, raking in $125 million last 
year, yet millions of people around 
the world still can’t afford them. 
Except for Berkeley, none of the UC 
campuses really try to ensure that the 
medicines they develop get into the 
hands of the world’s poorest patients. 
In fact, Chancellor Fox and President 
Yudof have actively resisted lobbying 
efforts by students for the past three 
years to change this. 

This World AIDS Day let’s finally 
make the change happen. President 
Yudof is asking everyone engaged in 
research to sign a new patent agree-
ment that would give the univer-
sity ironclad possession of any new 
innovation you come up with. Tell 
him that you want the fruits of your 
research to be available and afford-
able to poor people worldwide by 
withholding your signature until the 
deadline. Let’s get the signatures to 
zero until patients in the developing 
world can benefit from our work.

to 8-percent increase and simply making the 65-team field 
will cause a 1-percent bump. 

Our team won’t be making it to the Sweet 16 anytime 
soon; in fact, sports teams are unable to compete in nation-
al tournaments for at least a year after making the move. 
But given time and dedication, a strong sports program will 
mean not only increased alumni donations, but increased 
applications, lower admit rates and a prestige that will lend 
value to degrees retroactively, even if UCSD is currently 
known primarily as being a pre-med factory. 

Investing in Division-I is an investment for the uni-
versity holistically. The class that passes this referendum 
and begins paying is the class that suffers most because of 
the time it takes for our teams to become competitive in 
their new division. And there’s no doubt that now is not a 
good time to raise student fees — but there will never be a 
good time. UC President Mark G. Yudof has vowed to ask 

the state for more funding, all while acknowledging that 
it’s more of a “wishlist” than a demand. Barring enormous 
political change, there will likely be little foreseeable change 
in the California economy in the next few years, save for it 
becoming worse. 

Those who like the idea of UCSD in Division I, just 
“not now,” can still take a breath. Even if the referendum 
passes, the fees will not go into effect until UCSD is accept-
ed by the Big West Conference and — considering we were 
just rejected last year in favor of Hawaii  — the change isn’t 
exactly imminent. Ultimately, it’s important enough that 
the students be able to decide. Any referendum placed on 
a ballot suffers from the bias of being likely to pass due to 
low turnout rates, so it’s doubly important now that every-
one votes.

This is an issue of what UCSD is versus what it could be 
—  the move needs to happen for UCSD to continue evolv-
ing, and there needs to be a class that pushes for it and 
takes the hit for long-term gain.

WINTER MOVIE PREVIEW

There are many reasons to see “Shame” this winter 
break, but only one important one — full frontal 
Michael Fassbender. Critics are already raving about 
Fassbender’s haunting performance as Brandon 
Sullivan, a moody hunk who just wants to get some. 
The film has already picked up an NC-17 rating with 
rave reviews at the Toronto, Venice, London and New 
York Film Festivals and boasts the direction of Steve 
McQueen. Anticipate a lot of tremulous lip biting 
from Sullivan’s sister, played by Carey Mulligan (“An 
Education”), dramatic furrowing on subway trains and 
of course, a few hotly anticipated nude scenes.

In “Carnage” — based on the play “God of Carnage” by 
Yasmina Reza — two couples aim to settle their sons’ 
schoolyard tiff in a civil agreement-turned darkly hilari-
ously head-to-head meltdown. Taking place entirely 
within the walls of the couples’ homes, the project might 
seem like a challenging on-screen adaptation. But it’s in 
the best possible hands, with Roman Polanski’s expert 
direction and a pitch-perfect cast (Jodie Foster and 
John C. Reilly vs. Kate Winslet and Christoph Waltz). Plus, 
plenty of sharp wit and drunken monologues will make 
“Carnage” a brief, well-acted bit of diabolical fun.

David Fincher (“The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,” 
“Fight Club”) directs Steven Zallian’s (“Schindler’s List”) 
screen adaptation of the explosively popular Swedish 
crime series by Steig Larsson. The thriller follows a 
journalist and a computer hacker (Daniel Craig and 
Rooney Mara respectively) as they search for a woman 
who has been missing for 40 years. Featuring a hard-
hitting score by Nine Inch Nails’ Trent Reznor, who 
worked with Fincher on last year’s “Social Network,” “Girl 
With the Dragon Tattoo” will be sure to offer more of 
Fincher’s patented jet-black imagery and gripping sto-
rytelling.

Spielberg returns to the early 20th century for another 
epic about a man struggling in a World War — this 
time with a horse. Adapted from a children’s book, 
this heart-felt tale plays right to Spielberg’s strengths, 
following a boy and his horse from humble country 
beginnings to the battlefields of World War I, with a 
love interest on the side. The unfamiliar cast is mostly 
British, though the music is more predictably scored 
by long-time collaborator John Williams. With a run-
ning time of over two hours and a release date set for 
Christmas, this Dreamworks film is sure to please the 
whole family — provided no one prefers something 
more surprising.

A true modern variation of Grimm’s classic fairy tale, “Sleeping 
Beauty,” packs a sinister punch that would send Disney prin-
cesses all atwitter. Emily Browning (Lemony Snickett) plays 
Lucy, a young college student who begins to take up work 
as a human sex toy to make extra cash. The only catch is that 
before each of her sexual encounters, she is surgically dolled 
up and drugged, and afterwards, her memory erased. Well, at 
least she didn’t get her finger pricked by a spindle. Nominated 
for a Palm D’Or during the Cannes Film Festival, director Julia 
Leigh’s version of “Sleeping Beauty” has received rave reviews.

“Take Shelter” follows Curtis LaForche (Michael Shannon 
of “Boardwalk Empire”), an Ohio husband and father who 
begins having apocalyptic visions and starts building a 
fallout shelter. As LaForche buries himself deeper into con-
structing the shelter, he is increasingly pulled away from his 
family and unsure of whether or not he has inherited his 
mother’s paranoid schizophrenia. Anchored by strong per-
formances from Shannon and Jessica Chastain as LaForche’s 
wife, “Take Shelter” provides a haunting glimpse of insanity 
and a definite best actor contender in the rising Shannon.

WE NEED TO
 TALK ABOUT 

KEVIN
1.27.12

“We Need to Talk About Kevin” — with its high school 
shooting plotline and the always-intense Tilda Swinton 
in a major role — is your antidote to the requisite 
Christmas �u� this season. Based on Lionel Shriver’s 
2003 novel, the �lm follows the downward spiral of Eva 
Khatchadourian (Swinton), a woman living through 
the hell of knowing that the son she raised opened �re 
on eight classmates. In a non-linear sequence, the �lm 
hopscotches through Eva’s present, the story of the 
shooting and the family history that may explain why 
the crime occurred. Already out in the UK and garnering 
wide critical acclaim, “Kevin” is a bleak drama about how 
the choices people make shape their children.

YOUNG

In “Young Adult,” Jason Reitman ( “Up In the Air”) collabo-
rates with “Juno” wordsmith Diablo Cody for the second 
time. And while distinctly not a teenager, the protagonist 
of the comedy ain’t so different from Cody’s past hero-
ine. Mavis Gary (Charlize Theron) — a teen lit writer who 
returns to her hometown to reclaim her married high 
school sweetheart — is a woman obviously still attached 
to her high school days. Expect snappy dialogue between 
Theron and Patton Oswalt as a former classmate — with 
hopefully less hipsterisms that Juno in between.

the very tough CCAA conference.  
       “I am really pleased by the job 
everyone did over the summer to 
improve their game,” Carlson said. 
“[The team] came back from sum-
mer in shape. It speaks well of our 
commitment going into this year.” 
       In Carlson’s opinion, that com-
mitment could be enough to make 
them the best team in the CCAA, 
a conference that sent three teams 
to the NCAA Championships.  
    Senior center Christian Hatch, last 
year’s points leader with an average 
of 14 points a game, has stepped 
up this year to pick up some of the 
slack after the team lost Ryan. So 
far this year, Hatch is averaging 18 
points per game and 9.6 rebounds. 
       Senior Justin Brue and junior 
Tyler McGrath have matured as 
players and already are individu-
ally averaging a little over 11 points 
per game, six points more than 
they did last year. On the boards, 
the duo has also seen success, 
with McGrath collecting over five 
boards a game and Brue bringing 
down nearly seven. Both of these 
numbers, combined with Hatch’s 
improved play, more than make up 
for the loss of Ryan, but the true 
measure of the team comes from the 
legacy Ryan created before he left. 
    As captain, Ryan averaged a double-
double every night and was the best 
rebounder in the league. His success 
was no accident, but rather the result 
of his attitude and commitment. 
    “He wasn’t a flashy player,” Carlson 
said. “He just came in, played 
his position and led the team.” 
       Casey set an example off the 
court as well, setting the pace in 
practice and in the weight room. 
This has carried over into the team 
this year. Now, however, the focus 
of the offense is on Hatch. With an 

All-Conference center, the Tritons 
actually have more weapons with 
which to score than ever before. But 
UCSD’s Achilles’ heel, according to 
Carlson, could be the team’s defense. 
       “In the past when this pro-
gram has been good, it has hinged 
on our defense,” Carlson said.  
       So far this year, the defense has 
been almost there, but not quite. 
Despite this, Carlson is happy 
with the advances the team has 

made. Defense is all about mind-
set, and Carlson has been work-
ing hard on giving the team direc-
tion in hopes of good results. 
       There are some quirks in the 
Triton lineup, like junior guard Ryan 
Peters. Peters does not have good 
numbers — he averages close to 
four points per game despite being 
on the court more than 24 min-

utes a night, and his boards are 
not much better at 2.8 per game. 
However, Peters has been playing 
with the same set of guys for three 
years. This, according to Carlson, 
is key to this year’s season. The 
team is made up of mostly seniors 
and juniors that have been playing 
together for a good amount of time.  
    Experience playing together meshes 
well with the Triton offensive mind-
set of “slow and steady wins the race.” 
       “We have a lot of basketball IQ,” 
Carlson said. “Every good basket-
ball team in America has to be able 
to push, and we will take advan-
tage of easy opportunities, but we 
really want to slow it down and 
get into our half-court offense.” 
    With Hatch down low, the Tritons 
can build an offense off of his pres-
ence. Other teams will have to 
respect in the paint, opening up 
space for the Triton shooters like 
McGrath and for slashers like Brue. 
       The starters are not the only 
weapons the Tritons possess, and 
coming off the bench does have 
its benefits, as demonstrated by 
senior forward Mike Mezza who 
came off the bench to average 9.8 
points in just 18 minutes of play. 
       In the CCAA, teams like CSU 
Los Angeles and Dominguez Hills 
are traditionally more athletic than 
the Tritons and utilize run-and-gun 
offenses that capitalize on this. If the 
Tritons can slow them down with 
good defense, and keep them slow 
with a smart half-court offense, they 
have a good shot at an upset for the 
CCAA conference title. The Tritons 
certainly look like they are up to the 
task with their experience and dedi-
cation towards coming together in 
the early stages of the season, point-
ing to a good year down the road.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  THURSDAY, DECEMBER 1,  2011 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG 11

At first I didn’t recognize my symptoms as 

mental illness – I thought I was just having 

some bad days. Then, I learned that 1 in 4 

adults experience mental health challenges 

such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder 

and others. I got help and now I am moving 

forward with my life. Recovery is possible and 

getting help is an important first step.

Mental illness  
can affect anyone.

Read up to recognize the signs.

nance in the back court, senior for-
ward Lauren Freidenberg picked up 
the boards and junior guard Emily 
Osga had a breakthrough year, grow-
ing into her role as point guard. 

UCSD ended its season with a 
20–11 overall record, and was escort-
ed from the conference tournament 
in the first round with a disappointing 
75–78 loss against Cal Poly Pomona.

The Tritons entered this season 
ranked No. 13 nationally, and after 
winning six straight games, they have 
since moved up to No. 5. UCSD 
was also picked to win the CCAA 
conference in the annual pre-season 
coaches poll.

“We are really excited with how 
the season has started but we also 
know that this conference is always 
so tough that we have to be ready to 
play every night,” head coach Charity 
Elliot said.

With a whole year under its belt, 
the Triton roster seems to be gelling. 
In her usual fashion, Carlisle — who 
has garnered CCAA Player of the 
Week honors twice already this sea-
son — is averaging 17.8 points a game 
and 5.6 assists per game. 

However, this season Carlisle 
seems to be getting a little more 
help on the offensive end. Six-foot-
one Freidenberg provides a presence 
in the paint for the Tritons and 
is also averaging 12.8 points per 
game. Osga, who runs the Triton 
back court, is averaging 11.3 points 
per game and is second in rebounds 
for the Tritons, only behind soph-
omore forward Erin Dautremont. 
Dautremont, who came off the 
bench for the Tritons as a freshman, 
averages 7.7 boards a game. Senior 
sharpshooter Daisy Feder, whose 
three-point range poses a constant 
threat from the perimeter, rounds 
out the starting lineup.

“I really like the depth we have 

on this team and how each night dif-
ferent people are stepping up.” Elliot 
said.

Elliot — who enters her fourth 
season as head coach — also ros-
tered six freshmen, who have proved 
capable in their first few collegiate 
matches.

“Our freshmen continue to work 

really hard every day and I think in 
another three or four weeks, we will 
start seeing greater contributions by 
all of them,” Elliot said.

With a 6–0 record thus far, the 
Tritons appear strong going into 
CCAA conference play. This past 
weekend, Nov. 25 to Nov. 26, UCSD 
beat CSU San Marcos and No. 4 

Fort Lewis to win their Annual 
Thanksgiving Classic. The week 
prior, on Nov. 18 to Nov. 17, the 
Tritons topped Hawaii Pacific and 
Hawaii Hilo to claim the title in the 
Hawaii Hilo Vulcan Classic. 

The Tritons begin their confer-
ence season on the road, with back-
to-back matches against Cal State 

Dominguez Hills on Friday, Dec. 
2 and Cal State Los Angeles on 
Saturday, Dec. 3.

UCSD’s first home game is slated 
for Monday, Dec. 12. against Cal State 
San Bernardino.

With every player on last year’s roster returning to the court for the 2011-12 season, the Tritons will look to advance past the 
conference tournament in the upcoming sea-
son.

After graduating a number of staples the 
year before, the reformed Triton roster found 
itself in a period of transition. The Tritons 
had to find their footing, although senior All-

The UCSD men’s basketball team has only had three winning sea-sons in the past 10 years, two of which have been under the guid-
ance of head coach Chris Carlson, hired in 
2007. This year the Tritons have to come to 
grips with the loss of graduated senior Casey 
Ryan, who was the team captain as well as 
team leader in rebounds. After winning the 
Disney Classic for a second year in a row, 
the team looks like it could be competitive in
