The term often brings to mind a hunched-over scientist, 
intent only on his work and his calculator. 

The name Roger Revelle, however, means much more.

lThis is the first In a two-part interview with Roger 
Revelle. The second part will appear in the final issue on 
Friday.] 

TT: Dr. Revelle, what was the vision of the founding 
fathers of UCSD and what did they believe the function of an 
institution of higher learning should be? 

Revelle: When this university was born, we who were 
involved with it initially thought of what a college education 
should be. Remember, those were optimistic times; times 
of rapid change and unlimited horizons.

-a. Revelle is currently the Richard Saltonstall Professor of 

Population at Harvard University and is the former 
director of the Harvard Center of Population Studies. He 
served as Director of the Scripps Institute of Oceanography 
from 1960 through 1964 and was a professor of 
oceanography from 1948-1964. 

We believed that the object of a college education was not 
to acquire a body of knowledge, but to " learn how to learn." 
We felt that in the rapidly changing world of our times, few 
of the so-called facts one learns in college are likely to be 
useful, or even true, ten years later. But what would be 
permanently useful is the language and the logic of a 
science or a humanistic field, and also the demonstration 
that it is possible to learn something new that is not already 
known, in other words, to make discoveries. We wanted to 
show students that the search for discoveries is an exciting 
and satisfying adventure.

should contain humanists and artists and both social and 
natural scientists 

During the 19508 Revelle was instrumental in starting the 
San Diego campus of the University of California and in 
1965 the Regents named the first college at San Diego in his 
honor. In addition to his professorship at Harvard, Revelle 
is also professor of Political Science and Public Policy at 
uam. 

'IT: What were some of the specific ideas with which you 
began? Was the conception of the college cluster system 
formulated at the time? 

In addition, each small university would have both 
graduate and undergraduate students and there would be 
as little distinction as possible between graduates and 
undergraduates. Undergraduates would participate with 
the faculty in research, so that they must be given an 
awareness of the unknown. Our purpose was to make 
colleagues of our students in the great adventure of lear-
ning. 

Studeots-"Learn to Learn" 
TT: You mentioned that at UCSD, the students are en-

couraged to " learn how to learn." Is this how the idea of 
introducing students to not one but several disciplines was 
conceived and consequently, the goal of educating 
"Renaissance" men and women as well? 

Revelle: We thought that the new university should be 
organized as a group of small, semi-autonomous univer-
sities, side by side. 

As he is so much a part of UCSD history, the Triton Times 
felt it appropriate to interview Revelle and get his im-

so-called '''gradeflation''--high Green Thumbs on Camnus grades for essentially mediocore t! 
Included in the plan is a 

provision that would make the 
grade point average (GPA) in 
required high school courses count 
six times the weight of test scores 
for those students with a GPA 
between 3.0 and 3.1. 

Currently, under UC regulations, 
students whose GPA in required 
courses is between 3.0 and 3.1 must 
earn a total score of 2,500 or higher 
on the Scholastic Aptitude Tests 
(SAT) and three achievement 
tests. Students who have a GPA of 
3.1 or better are eligible for ad-
mission, with test scores on 
required entrance examinations 
not used as entrance determinants. 

The University terms the change 
as one "made in an effort to im-
prove the reading, writing and 
mathematical skills of entering 
students, skills which these tests 
measure." 

Essentially, the move is thought 
of as one which will in the future 

Rally on'UC 
Holdings Set 
For Thursday 

A second rally to protest 
University of California in-
vestments will be held next 
Thursday at noon on Revelle plaza. 

The rally, sponsored by the 
Campus Coalition on Apartheid 
and University Cutbacks, is the 
second to take place this month. 
The protest this week has included 
the picketing of Chancellor 
McElroy's office and also an arm-
band campaign demonstrating 
"SOlidarity" with the South African 
freedom struggle. 

Endorsing the rally is ASUCSD 
president Jeff Leifer who said, "I 
urge all students, faculty and staff

against UC investment Thursday. 
The mo,'ement to get the UC out of

difficult to judge the "true" level of 
applicants. It is often seen now that

with high GPAs are unable to 
perform college-level work.

The changes were recommended 
by the Board of Admissions and 
Relations with Schools (BOARS), a 
faculty committee to which the 
Academic Senate has delegated 
authority for regulations regarding 
UC admissions requirements. 

Controversy Over Changes 
Controversy surrounds some of 

the proposed changes, as they 
seem to totally reject the 
recommendations made earlier 
this year by a University task force 
appointed by UC President David 
Saxon. 

The task force recommended the 
standardized tests be dropped as 
they were termed " discriminatory 
against minorities." 

However, the University has 
given repeated assurances that the 
requirements could be tightened 
without unfairly discriminating 
against minorities and are being 
instituted only to help stem the 
"declining fre hman standards." 

banana tree, lemon tree and rose 
bush"-three lucky holdovers that 
were spared when the gardeners 
moved in. 

And not just plants grow at the 
garden. Eighteen chickens and 
three ducks "graze" for insects 
and .snails around the perimeter. 
"Butch," the sole rooster, spends 
his ~ime eyeing visitors and 
planning possible attacks. 

Members of the Wilderness Class 
and UCSD Organic Gardening 
Society work the garden. 
Additionally , any individual 
related to the university can plant 
and many take advantage of the 
opportunity. 

The purpose of the garden, ex-
plains Revelle senior Michael 
McClune, coordinator of the 
Gardening Society, is to " Dromote 

'" 

organic gardening and en-
vironmentally sound lifestyles." 

A "Closed System" 
A goal of the experimental 

garden is to produce a closed 
system in which all parts of the 
garden fit into a cycle and no un-
natural products are added. The 
chickens control the bugs instead 
of pesticides (Davis explains that 
the land is so fertile it produces 
enough for the bugs too) and rot-
ting vegetables are fed to the 
chickens. Weeds are composted 
and horse manure from La Jolla 
Farms is used for fertilizer. 

The Wilderness Class uses the 
vegetable garden to provide food 
for the potluck dinners held for 
guest speakers. " It's an example 
of partial self-sufficiency," says 
Davis. Also the garden plays a part 
in the teaching of the class. The 
spice and herb garden is utilized by 
the sections dealing with folklore . 

Davis described the garden a,fa 
cooperative effort and talked fX 
"work parties" where everybody 
puts up fences , hoes weeds and 
plows. " Women do the heavy work 
too," she adds. 

Future plans for the garden 
include using chicken excrement in 
a methane digester to produce 
energy in order to, in turn, cook the 
chickens. Butch may go first. 

While the garden is in use all 
year, McClune would like to see 
year round operation using the 
methane disgester and the 
greenhouses (made from scrap 
materials ).

OrgE.!nic Gard ning Society can

Go to Rally, Pr.otest 
UC Aid to Apartheid 

In last quarter's campus-wide referendum, students recommended 
that the University of California sever all ties with the white-racist 
nations of South Africa and Rhodesia. In tbe past few weeks, students on 
several California college campuses have demonstrated on the same 
theme. 

The Board of Regents owns stock in severnl multinational corporations 
that do business with the South African government. UC investment 
dollars therefore are going to help prop up a minority government that 
regularly oppresses the blacks who comprise a majority of the South 
African population. The argument made by American corporntions is 
that their inve tment money keeps those blacks employed. 

We don't buy that argument. Rather, we agree with UCSD sociology 
professor Anthony Ngubo, who said at a rally bere last week that 
Americ3n investments have helped the South African government to 
"strengthen its oppre sive machinery." 

We believe the university should use its investment dollars for more 
constructive purposes than perpetuating apartheid. Last week, 350 
students who feel the same way rallied on Revelle plaza, in conjunction 
with similar rallies held throughout the state. The rallies have had an 
effect: the Regents sent a letter to corporations in which they bold stock, 
asking what steps they have taken to end racist practices at their South 
Afrif'an plants. 

Another rally has been scheduled for Thursday at 1I00n, on Revelle 
plaza. II you care that UC money is being used to perpetuate apartheid in 
South Africa you should show up and let the Regents know.

Open letter 

YSA Defends. Stand on Zionism 
It is not our purpose to become 

involved in a marathon debate. 
The YSA has submitted two ar-
ticles to the Triton Times (April 20 
and May 18), relating our Ideas on 
condemning the policies of Israel. 
After the first, a certain Ralph 
Grunewald of the Union of Jewish 
Students responded. He called us 
" anti-semitic" and grossly 
distorted the meaning of our 
statements ab!lut Israel's trade 
relations with South Africa. We 
submitted a thorough counter-
response (our second article), 
which corrected his specious 
claims. 

But the obtuse Grunewald could 
not be pacified. He had another 
article printed in the Triton Times 
(June 3). This time, in his eyes, we 
are not just "Anti-semitic" (a 
vilification even one of his fellow 
UJS members told us he disagreed 
with ), but are " misguided, 
blatantly anti-semitic (and 
therefore racist)," Surely this is 
too much. 

Grunewald's second letter was 
even more outrageous than , his 
first. He also asserts that he made 
"a careful reading" of our second 
article and then accuses us of 
" hypocrisy and double stan-
dardism" for " justifying" Third 
World nations' trade with South 
Africa when we condemn Israel's 
role. We feel the evidence indica tes 
that he made a very superficial 
reading of both our letters. Con. 
cerning his allegations, there are 

. many things we wrote which he 
chose notto consider: 

1. He chose to ignore how we 
stated that we completely support 
the rights of the Jewish people to 
live anywhere in the world they 
want. We just do not support the 
ultranationalistic movement of 
politic.al Zionism which denies the 
same right to the indigenous 
Palestinians. 

2. He diose to ignore what we 
wrote about there being many 
Jewish members in the YSA as 
well as the Socialist Workers' 
Party (our fraternal organization). 

economic. relations with South 
Africa are the powerful, in-
dustrialized Western nations. The 
YSA helped build the "US/UC Out 
of South Africa Rally" of June 3. 
Did Grunewald or the UJS? Of 
course not. 

4. He chose to ignore our ex-
planation that we pointed out only 
Israel's trade relations with SA, in 
our first article, because the 
subject of the article was Israel. 

5. He chose to ignore how we 
explained that we spoke of the 
increasing trade relations not as a 
subject in itself, but as one 
illustration of something more 
important ; the close friendship 
that has developed between the 
Zionist settler state and the Boer 
settler state. There is no friendship 
between South Africa and the 
Third World nations it trades with. 

We also charged tbat during 
World War II, American Zionists 
opposed the lilting of immigration 
quotas for Jews escaping the 
Holocaust, because it interfered 
with their goal of a future Jewish 
state . Grunewald calls this 
"another Big Lie". But other than 
just talking about "J ewish Law", 
he gives no concrete proof. 

Nor could he have, for our 
charge is factUal. An example is 

Zionist leader Itzhak Greenbawn, 
head of the Jewish Agency Resrue 
Conunittee. In 1943, he declared to 
the Zionist Executive Council, "If I 
am asked 'Could you give, from 
United Jewish Appeal moneys to 
rescue Jews?' I say 'No; and I say 
again, No.' In my opinion we have 
to resist that wave which puts 
Zionists activities in the second 
line." At the same time, the 

. Socialist Workers' Party was 
demanding "Open the Door!" 

At the end of his article Grun-
wald says, about Jews in Palestine, 
" If 2000 years of ... settlement and 
history are not requirements for 
legitimacy, then perhaps nothing 
is ." Two thousand years? At the 
tum of the century, Palestine was 
only ten percent Jewish. Before 
that the percentage was even 
smaller. Jewish ~lonization of 
Palestine is almost exclusively a 
'Twentieth century phenomenon. 
Grunewald has nothing to say, of 
course, about the indigenous 
majority who had lived there for 
two millenia, whom the Zionists 
pushed out and keep out. But that is 
precisely the point. Grunewald is 
the perfect el<.ample of the type of 
chauvinism we vehemently op-
pose.

Revelle ... 
Continued from Page 1 

Revelle: Well, "learning how to 
learn" and developing 
" renaissance men" should not be 
cohfused. The key thing about 
"renaissance men" is that tbey 
didn't know very much since there 
wasn't much to know, Today, the 
situation is entirely different. Each 
discipline is now so complex and 
full of substance that it is very hard 
for a person to know everything in 
his own field, let alone things 
outside his field. 

So the "renaissance man" 
concept, as he is usually in-
terpreted, namely is a person who 
knows something about a lot of 
different things, is also liable to be 
a very superficial individual. That 
is why I felt that the function of a 
university from an educational 
point of view was not to teach 
students to "learn how to learn;" 
not to learn a lot of facts, but to 
learn how to solve problems. This, 
in turn, means that in our time, 11 
" renaissance man" should be 
familiar with different ways or 
paradigms of thinking of different 
disciplines and not be concerned 
just with remembering a If men 
and women can develop an un. 
derstanding of different ways of 
viewing the world and how to 
combine these in an in-
terdisciplinary fa~hion, he will 
then perhaps be able to introduce 
something new that will benefit 
their fellow human beings. 

Lack of Intellectual Respect 
'IT: Speaking from the student 

perspective, there is evidently a 
basic lack of conununication and 
lack of intellectual respect bet-
ween the faculty and the students. 
In essence, students are told , "this 
is the truth, memorize it." Facts 
and figures by themselves do not 
add up to a satisfying learning 
experience. 

Revelle: If you are saying there 
is too much distance between 
students and faculty, I agree. That 
is why I believe that learning 
should be a co-operative effort, 
where the faculty- and the student 
are working together on something 
that is unknown . That it why it is so 
important for a student to " learn 
how to learn" in order to un. 
derstand different human values 
a~d viewpOints of the world. But 
that takes time and patience and 
also a love for learning in itself. If 
students remain motivated and 
decide to continue in education, 
they will find that the " facts and 
rigures" will in time take on more 
meaning as they develop their 
ability to learn . 

But it is a good thing that 
students are asking questions 
about what is true, for they will 
find that even if -they become 
academic experts later in life, that 
this questioning is a never ending 
process.

Local NAACP Head 
Against Forces Busing 

by Reed Alpert 
Staff Writer 

Dr. Charles Thomas gently guided the conversation away from in-
tegration and onto the subject of quality education. 

"The evidence. is extremely unreliable that integration improves 
quality education," he pointed out. " I see no significant.changes relative 
to the movement o{ students." 

Thomas is a professor. of Urban and Rural Studies at UCSD. He is also 
on the Citizens Advisory Corrunission on Racial Integration and is 
pr8sident of the Sail Diego chapter of the National Association for the 
Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) . 

The Triton Times recently interviewed him with the idea of discussing 
the recent reports delivered to the San Diego Board of Education by the 
Citizens Advisory Commission on the subject of achieving racially 
balanced schools in San Diego. The commission suggested that a year of 
voluntary integration take place before any mandatory busing be or-
dered. 

Are you in favor of mandatory busing? 
" Of course not! " Thomas replied. "My concern is obtaining quality 

education and integration doesn't necessarily lead to it," he continued. "I 
have seen too many good people come out of situations that aren't in-
tegrated. " 

He listed some of the factors in a quality education. First, is the 
physical, psychological and social well-being of the student. Children 
learn by watching the people around them, he says; there must be proper 
role-models for the students to emulate . Next he mentioned that students 
must be competent in reading, writing and mathematics at their grade 
level. Finally, he mentioned that there must be options open to students. 
If a student wants to learn in a group situation it should be available . 
Students showing a need for individualized attention should have access 
to it. 

He is careful to pomt out thata quality education is an issue for students 
of all races. Students in an all-white school suffer from a lack of cultural 
rounding too, he says. 

"We live in an everchanging, technological, multi-cultural society. I 
favor the removal of all social obstacles that deny equal opportunities. 
That means justice, freedom, all the social ideals."

Hart Bochner: Â· Home Boy Makes Good 
by Dorothy HOIIItoa 

Staff Writer 
During the outdoor Interview he 

spoke to three passing women. "Call 
me tonight," he called to two of 
them. He then turned his dark good 
looks to me and continued his 
professionally smooth voice. 

Whether he intends to or not Muir 
junior Hart Bochner (appearing in 
the major motion picture " Islands in 
the Stream" with George C. Scott) 
fits almost perfecUy into the easy-
going, handsome young movie actor 
role, 

Bochner, son of movieITV actor 
Uoyd Bochner was selected to play 
Scott's eldest son in the movie 
during the sununer of 1975. He spent 
the following fall quarter filming in 
Hawaii. "Islands in the Stream," 
based on the Hemingway novel, is 
Bochner's first professional job. It 
opened recently in San Diego. 

When younger, Bochner had "just 
a little" exposure to the studios. His 
father never actively encouraged 
Bochner to act. Bochner explained 
why: " You're as good as your last 
picture, nobody cares about how 
intelligent or nice you are, the art 
world doesn't matter intellectually, 
you're a commodity." Bochner 
continued to say that the acting 
business is a very insecure field. 
" The potentials for work are not 

another (Ibn. "It was a great film. Yet Bochner, who had been 
learning experience and I was on my .'It\llrll~" like crazy" during winter 
own. It was something I was com- said that he loves the work 
pletely devoted to," he said . the people , But he is bothered In 
Because of. the experience of doing ways with public reaction to 
film and of the promotion activities "It's interesting how the 
he was involved In, Bochner said he no longer treats you as one of 
is more able to speak up and masses; I'm just as normal as 
generate discussion. He added that nelt person," he said. 
his ability to make people enjoy One might elpect that flying 
themselves has been enhanced. the country promoting the 

Bochner's father told him he would interrupt Bochnef's 
would be exploited while promoting But he boasted of 

greatat all." -'-"_.JII 
But Bochner is already to do 

grades for winter quarter and in-
dicated that his college life hasn't 
been interrupted. " I enjoy college," 
stated Bochner . 

Bochner feels fortWlate to have 
done a film with Scott. He described 
him as a great acting teacher and a 
paternal figure . Both got along well 
during the filming. " Scott's 
disgusted with motion pictures," 
said Bochner. "When we finished the 
film he said to me 'you've done it, 
now bea doctor." 

Rather than display a " rush-right-
out-and-get-known" attitude to his 
future in acting, Bochner is taking it 
easy. He is not interested in doing 
TV. "TV's the downfall of society, 
it's a form of media that exploits the 
public," he explained. "TV's not 
concerned with creativity," 

Bochner went on to say that he 
would never do anything he wouldn't 
be proud of. 

Bochner is currently a literature 
Ill<Ijor and will be finishing his un-
dergraduate work in Colorado or at 
Stanford or UC Berkeley. He is not 
happy with the literature depart-
menthere. 

A long term interest of Bochner's 
is to direct and produce films . This 
interest, Bochner said, is one of the 
reasons he enjoys acting. He also 
said that no matter how successful 
one is, it shouldn't alter his values, 
one should be the " same honest 
person." 

Recent Aspirations To

Playing the Fool - Gentle Giant 
(Capitol ) 

Art for art's sake would be a 
dandy premise for expressiveness 
if it didn 't serve as an excuse for 
th~ kind of self indulgence that puts 
off philistines like myself. Gentle 
Giant has always been one of the 
better progressive rock bands 
around-their technical skills are 
equal to their musical fancies, 
With the release of this double 
record live set, on which they 
reprise the best known work from 
their previous albwns in versions 
considerably more slovenly than 
the originals, I reached my 

saturation point. 
Simply, Giant indulges in its 

strong points too much. The in-
. cessant intricacy, the relentless 
counterpoint, convoluted melody 
structures and the strident vocals 
that struggle over the 
arrangements become irritating 
after a while and one garners an 
impression that the band is in a 
stiff Ii pped rut. 

Some variance in their material" 
would help, like shorter songs, less 
ambitious arrangements, more 
earth based lyrics, grainier vocals, 
anything that would bring their 
intellectual endeavors down from

Keller, who prepped at Boulder 
High School in Colorado, is traIlS-
ferring from Eastern New Mexico 
University, where he was a star-
ting forward in 76-77, His ex-coach, 
Sterling Gibson, says Keller is "a 
solid kid, a good outside shooter," 
Last season in 14 contests as a 
sophomore, Keller averaged 6.5 
points per game and 2 rebounds, 
"He can't get off his shot quick 
enough and is a little slow," Gibson 
said in a telephone interview, " but 
he's an asset to any team because 
of.his gre~t attitude." 

Keller plans a major in biology 
as a preparation for dentistry 
school at USC, where his father is 
an alumnus. 

Conyers was . a second-string 
forward last season for Rio Hondo 
CoUege in Whittier. He never 
played high school baU due to a 
painful leg bone disease. "Brad 
had showed tremendous im-
provement and is eager to learn," 
says his JC coach Bob Bland, who 
added " he has average mobility 
and fair shooting but doesn't jump 
weU." While playing for the 
Roadrunners, Conyers scored just 
1.4 points and 1.5 rebounds per 
game. Because he was still lear-
ning the game, Rio Hondo's offense 
literally excluded Conyers from 
the ball, (UCLA did the same with 
Swen Nater, who didn't play 
basketbaU until he was 17 years old 

and now starts for the NBA 
Milwaukee Bucks) 

The Tritons have never had a tall 
team and even though the two 
recruit's statistics aren't overly 
impressive, Cunningham's 
analysis of Conyers summed up the 
pair's possible contribution to the 
team: "He's no super but he should 
help,"

caU the police. 

S. The police arrived at the scene and as we entered the shop one of the 
employees reiterated that he knew nothing of the stolen bike, and that he 
was working on a Schwinn bike inside the shop. 

7. At that point I noticed my gear levers, front derailer, kick-stand, 
chain guard on this Schwinn bike he was working on. Other parts of my 
bike were lying on the bench, 

8. So far the bikeshop has been reluctant to co-operate with the police. 
If anyone has any knowledge of this incident or has had any similar 

experience, please contact Murray Penhollow at the campus police. The 
stolen bike was an orange Volkscycle Mark V.
