Irene Flores, left, and Horacio Ortiz are among 
the Third College students upset over the way 
the College Council decided to name its 
newsletter "lumumba-Zapata Communique" 
Ortiz says he has gathered 180 signatures by 

students who want to recall the council 
members for deciding the newsletter name in 
secrecy. Flores resigned her post in protest of the 
Council's behavior. 

Women 
Harrassed 
At Library 

BY KATHY HUFFER 
Campus police received two 

eparate reports of a man 
publicy "playing with himself" 
in front of woman at Central 
Library last night, adding to 
two reports of indecent 
exposure on Sunday. ' 

The man was described by 
witnesses as white, in his mid· 
30s, dean.cut, tanned. ahout 
six feet tall with sandy blond 

~air. He wore gold wire· 
nmmed glasses and carried a 
black umbrella and a 
briefcase, witnesses said. 

Police responded to the first 
report of the man at about 
9:30 pm, but were unable to 
locate him in the library . 

Sparks Fly Over Name 
For Third Newsletter

Pleading for college unity, sent to a recall vote . 

the Third College Council 
managed to convince a 
petitioner last night to hold 
back the signatures he has 
gathered calling for the 
Council' recall. 

Horacio Ortiz ha . 1 0 
names on a petition he and 
several others circulated in 
protest of the Council ' s 
behavior while deciding on the 
name "Lumumba.Zapata

newsletter . 

Ortiz contends, and the 
council members have 
admitted, that they kept secret 
minutes of the meeting when 
they decided on the name.

signatures and at least 170 of 
them can be verified, (10 
percent of Third students), the

The council was repri· 
manded by a vote of the Third 
College Forum (a group of 
" student leaders" ) Sunday 
night . But Ortiz says that is not 
enough . 

He a ked the council last 
night to s~nd a letter of 
apology to all Third College 
student leaders and for the 
council to send three 
representatives to meet with 
his group. 

Ortiz said he wanted to be 
convinced that the council 
would not do something so 
deceitful again, "Or he would 
force the recall." 

Leslie Reed, speaking for 
the council, said that the 
council had held back the 
minutes of the meeting as a 
"tactic ."

Adams Approaches 
UCSD as a Mystery 
Midwestern Chancellor Hopeful 
Has Questions About Job 

BY JEFF BERESFORD-HOWE 
New. Editor 

He 's been an outsider from 
the beginning of the 
chancellor' search process. 

He didn 't know he was 
being seriously considered as a 
candidate for the post until 
told so by a reporter. 

The University of California 
is a mystery, and he is 
completely unfamiliar with the 
UCSD college system. 

He told the chancellor's 
search committee that there 
would be some "serious 
handicaps" in his perfonnance 
if appointed chancellor 
because he knew so little about 
the system. 

Most people who are 
guessing around campus think 
his competition , National 
Science Foundation Director 
Richard Atkinson, is and 
always has been UC President 
David Saxon's choice for the 
chancellorship. 

. And Robert Adams isn't 
even telling for sure whether he 
wants the job. 

" It's a highly cort;lplicated 
and responsible unc1ertaking; 
I'm not hacking away from the 
job," he say . "Of cour e, I'm 
not seeking it either. " 

Adams, Dean of Social 
Sciences at the University of 
Chicago graduate school, is 
one of two finalists for the 
chancellor's post here. He met 
with the search committee for 

hours in Los Angeles Sunday, 
and came away· with 
reservations about the job he 
could do. 

"If I'm chancellor, hew do I 
form an understanding of who 
to talk to? It'll be hard to come 
in knowing virtually nothing 
about the system, with no 
networks of communication. I 
would ha ve some very serious 
handicaps if I came to 
UCSD." 

But he did like the search 
committee. 

"It is remarkably wide· 
ranging and thoughtful - as 
broadly representative a 
search committee as I've ever 
run into," he said in a Daily 
Guardian interview yesterday. 

He has thought a little about 
the way the committee has 
gone about appointing the new 
chancellor, and the fact that he 
didn't know he was a finalist 
until Thursday. 

"I thought about that, and I 
guess you have to think about 
how you would do it 
differently. Given a committee 
with a different agenda and 
different perspectives, I can 
see a need to keep things 
enclosed for as long as 
possible. There has been 
disagreement on the 
committee, and, I've been 
told, sharp differences on the

He was later seen on the 
sixth floor reading a 
newspaper and " playing with 
himself," a woman witness, 
who notified library employees 
of the man, said. 

Campus police did not 
respond to the second call 
because the man was seen 
leaving Central at the time 
they were notified, according 
to Sgl. Bill Molt of campus 
police. 

BY CAROLYN FRIDAY 
Sacramento Correspondent 

Opponents of the landlord· 
sponsored initiative to 
control rent scored a victory 
last Friday when a Superior 
Court judge' ruled that the 
summary for Prop. 10, as 
presented in the voter 
pamphlet, was misleading. 

Rent Control Ballot 
SUDlmarv Rewritten 

paign, the initiative was titled 
"Rent Control," which the 
opponents of the measure 
believe was intentionally 
construed to make people 
think the measure would give 
renter relief. 

Last night ' s incident 
followe9 two reports Sunday 
of a man exposing himself on 
the north side of campus. 
Described as a white male with 
dark hair in his mid·30s, he 
apparently was not the same 
man witnessed last night, Mott 
said. 

Although campus police 
will keep an eye out for the 
man seen last night, they 
cannot detain him because he 
did not "actually expose his 
private parts ... to show he was 
sexually aroused," Molt said. 

Mott said the man was "not 
dangerous" and would have 
been requested to identify 
himself to police :f located. 

Marlene Morales, i\ student 
supervisor at Central, said last 
night that sexual harrassm nt 
and indecent exposures occur 
frequently at the library . 

Judge John Keene ordered 
the 100· word summary 
drafted by state Attorney 
George Deukmejian be 
expand ed to include a 
statement that the initiative 
"repeals existing rent control 
ordinances" or words to that 
effect. 

Keene rejected two other 
requests in the same suit filed 
by Californians Against 
Initiative Fraud to remove 
the entire measure from the 
ballot and to modify the 
proponent's ballot argu· 
ments. 

The judge 31so dismissed a 
suit filed by Californians for 
10, a coalition of realtors, 
banker and construction 
unions that contended the 

." 

oppoRent ballot arguments 
were false and misleading. 

Among the arguments the 
proponents objected to were 
those signed by L.A. Mayor 
Tom Bradley, L.A. State 
Senator David Roberti, and 
Raoul T eilhet, president of 
Ca lifornia Federation for 
Teachers , that stated Prop. 
10 does absolutely nothing 
for renter , does not protect 
tenants again t rent gouging, 
and retaliation . and would 
eliminate local control. 

As composed by Califor· 
nians for Fair Rent 
Standards, an ambiguously 
named group of landlords, 
realtors and construction 
unions. Prop. 10 would 
abolish current local rent 
control ordinances, prohibit 
statewide rent control, 
,~quire future rent control 
measures to be approved by 

voters in local elections, and 
allow landlord to raise rent 
at the same rate as the 
Consumer Price Index. 

Charge of misrepresenta· 
tion have surrounded the 
initiative since the signature· 
gathering tage. 

Last November Califor· 
nia's major newspapers, who 
traditiollully oppose rent 
control, reported the 
fra\.ldulent practices used to 

' obtain the 600 , 000 
signatures needed to qualify 
the initiative for the June 3 
ballot. Petition circulators 
allegedly hid from view the 
title and summary and 
answered que tions in uch a 
way as to p rpetrate a 
misunderstanding of the 
issue while gathering 
signatures. 

Throughout the ntire 
signature·gathering am· 

"There were tons of 
violations of the Ie tion 
code,' aid Richard Oliver, 
the Californian Rural Legal 
Assistance Attorney. who 
represent d th opponents. 
" But it up to the D.A. to 
prosecute. The D.A. in five 
counties - L.A . , Fresno , 
Tulare, Sonoma, and San 
Joaquin were all inform d of 
the violation, and yet 
nothing wa done. Th y're 
up against people who 
support law and order, the 
establishment, the big 
money. /t 's a political 
decision." 

Oliver 'ubmitted to the 
Superior Court a letter from 
one mobile hom park owner 
to his f IIow mobil home

Letters to the Editor 

Suggestions For The University'sFiscal Situation 
Editor: 

I write this letter as one of 
the many students dismayed 
at the prospect of having to 
raiae an additional $2,000 
each year for tuition. Since 
The Dailll Guardian is read by 
administrators and faculty as 
well a •• tudents, perhaps there 
is a chance that my 
suggestions will actually do 
some good. 

Diego {hearsay, but this isn't a 
research paper). Thi. is to say 
that the grocery stores, 
landJords, gas station. and 
other merchants of the area 
would lose a quarter of their 
incomes if UCSD's students 
and staff did not bring money 
into the area. If the university's 
populace were more self-
sufficient and clolely knit, 
perhaps we could enjoy the 
profit of our own expenditures. 

in might help (1,000 out of 
state students would pay over 
$1 million more than resident 
students do). If they do settle 
here, the state of California will 
get to tax them without having 
to invest in their previous (first 
through 12th grade) 
education. 

The intent of this letter is not 
so much in its suggestion that 
UCSD be run more like a 
business or island state, but in 
the hope that imaginative 
solutions can be found to the 
foreseen program of state cuts. 
We could probably imagine an 
infinite number of solutions 

other than increasing tuition, 
and some of these solutions 
would work given the chance. 
On the other hand, increasing 
tuition might have an 
unforeseen disasterous effect 
on our already high attrition 
rate. 

MARK HENLEY 

How can UCSD keep its 

1,000 out of state students would pay 
over $1 million more tuition that 
resident students do 

The people of California reap 
unseen benefits from the taxes 
they pay, and if they vote to 
reduce their taxes, maybe we 
should "vote" to retract the ' 
benefit of our money being 
deposited in the community. 

I realize that the idea of UC 
going into business is a little 
scary, reminiscent of "the 
company store." It also 
reminds me, oddly, of 
operations of the CIA in which 
their "front" (some business) 
made money. 

relatively affordable tuition, 
and its full ltudent and faculty 
population., with a 30 percent 
cut in ltate aid? To begin with 
let us cOMider the properties 
surrounding UCSD that are 
owned by the UC Regents. 
The sale of these properties 
would undoubtedly raile 
enough money to offset the 
erias for some finite period of 
lime, but I would not advocate 
this. Instead, perhaps thil 
vacant land should be built 
upon. Such a project could be 
a source of student 
employment (both in design 
and construction), hOUling for 
the univel"lity and revenues in 
the fonn of rent. Rents could 
be lower for affiliates of the 
university than for the general 
public, and in the event that 
the time comes for UCSD to 
expand some of the facilities 
would already be constructed. 

Of course, the community 
will always benefit to some 
degree by having educated 
people in its midst. One of the 
benefits is that many of the 
students who graduate from 
UCSD will stay in the area and 
make it their permanent home. 

What Wasn't SaidOn College Bowl 
Editor: 

Perhaps the use of UCSD's 
vacant land il not the answer. 
However, other actions with 
similar economic constructs 
may be. UCSD creates a 
quarter of the income of San 

There is another possible 
solution to the funding 
problem which could thus 
benefit both the university and 
the community. If UCSD were 
to advertise for more out-of-
state students, many of whom 
would settle here, the out·of-
state tuition which they bring 

In your report (Daily Guardian, March 3) on 
the UCSD College Bowl at the Mandeville 
Center you might have made three further points. 

1) Ed Lazarus, the MC was terrific-brisk, 
poised, fair and amusing; 

2) The audience, too , was terrific . The show 
was remarkably well attended, and college spirit 
showed at its best. Those who missed the event 
missed an entertaining evening; and 

3) Many of the questions were trite or silly. 
(Were Rembrandt's paintings "warm" or 
"cool"?) Next time (soon, I hope), let's have a 
mix better suited to the occasion. Less on Anglo. 
American history and literature, more on 
biology, conservation, ecology and economy, 
music, space; on Asian, African and Latin 
American cultures; on Califomia, San Diego, 
'our own university and its colleges. This isn't 
Oxbridge in the 19305; it's UCSD in the 1980s.

Passion Play 
The pistol was still smoking and a man lie on the 

floor stabbing a ham sandwich. His wife walked in 
wearing a live ocelot around her neck that had a 
KKK flag clamped in its teeth. 

"Who cut the cheese?" he said. The gun barked 
again. 

"Missed," said the wife. The ocelot was dead and 
the KKK flag suddenly bore a hammer and cycle. 

"Next time," said the man. The hand sandwhich 
was now beyond repair.

Letters Are Nice 
One good thing about a newspaper is that it 

keeps in touch with the community through le tters to 
the editor. Letters provide a bridge between readers 
and the newspaper staff thai might otherwise be 
missing; newspaper people occasionally become 
isolated from their community. 

Don't let this happen here. 1/ something you read 
or heal about strikes your fancy, drop us a line. 

Just a few simple guidelines to keep in mind. Type 
your letters, preferably on a 72-space line. Try to 
keep them within a page-and.a.half, so there will be 
room for other people's comments .

Things Need To Be Tended To 
BY JOHN HONDROS 

The old guy used to fart to the nth degree when I was 
in the room. And what really cracked me up was that 
he would act like everything was normal and all when 
he did it, like nothing ever happened . I wouldn't say 
anything either. I would just stand there and hold my 
breath so none of it could creep into my system or 
something. 

John Hondros is associate news edUorof The Daily 
Guardian . 

But it wasn't his fault. Poor old Mr. J. just couldn't 
control himself. I mean, he had about twelve-thousand 
things wrong with him, not to mention that he had a 
machine for a heart and emphysema. The old guy was 
hopeless. I wouldn' t have been surprised if he didn't . 
even know half the time when he farted. But what 
really scared me was when he would just sit there 
trying to catch his breath for fourteen hours or so. He'd 
always be OK and all after, but he sure had me worried 
sometimes. After his attacks he couldn't remember a 
thing. He wouldn't have been able to find the clothes he 
had on if you asked him. So it was no wonder he would 
aiways forget which switch to throw for the right track. 

What I mean is the train track. Old Mr. J . had this 
train set that was the size of Brazil. The thing that 
really cracked me up was that he could never get the 
goddam thing to work half the time . But he was still 
always saying that he wanted to expand. I mean the 
set took up his whole "play" room, but that wasn't 
enough for old Mr. J. He told his old lady one day 
when I was there that he wanted to tear down one of 
the walls and expand, expand, expand. Poor Mrs. J. 
just about had a shit hemorrhage. 

The furthest he ever got, though, was to FJ Centro. 
Not the real EJ Centro, of course. Mr. J.'s FJ Centro 
was on the opposite side of the room, the side that 
wasn't infested with thirty million wires. The trains had 
to cross the window sill to get there . But you had to 
lwitch at Iealt two hundred switches before they made 
it over there. Poor old Mr. J. was always forgetting 
which ones. So he would just sit there scratching his 
scabby arm ,farting and running out of breath, while I 

stood near EI Centro rearranging the warehouses or 
something. It was really frustrating and all because I'd 
figured out nine centuries before him which switches 
worked for what. And every time I'd try to tell him, 
he'd say something like, "Quiet boy, I'm thinking." 

My friends at school could never figure out why I 
used to go over to his place so often. "It's extra 
cash," I'd tell them. What I mean is that the old guy 
used to pay me to play with his trains. Two.fifty an 
hour- that was more than minimum wage. He said 
he'd wanted to pay me to work on his set with him, to 
be his apprentice. That cracked me up because all he'd 
ever told me to do, the biggest task he ev~r gave me 
was to glue this tacky plastic grass around the tracks. 
He didn't want any in FJ Centro, though. Most of the 
time I just stood around listening to him think or 
holding my breath or something. Don't tell his old lady 
this, but he 'd insisted on paying me to eat peanut butter 
and jelly sandwiches with him a few times or so. I didn't 
feel too guilty, if you want to know. Old Mr. J . was 
loaded . • 

I sort of outgrew him after awhile. Old Mr. J . had 
become boring. I would have myoid lady think of 
excuses when he called so I wouldn't have to go play 
with him . It was like he was some goddam kid that you 
couldn't get rid of or something. But sooner or later he 
must've got the hint because I didn't hear from him. 

I'll never know why I decided to stop by his place 
after school that day. Mrs. J. was watering her 
rosebullhes when I walked up. She was happy and all 
because she said it had been ages since she'd seen me , 
as if I didn't know. But then she got all serious and told 
me something that really hit me hard . She told me that 
Mr. J. was dying, that he had cancer. 

Well, I don't remember the exact details, but I do 
know that when I went inside to see him he was in his 
bedroom snoring away. I don't know why , but then I 
went to the "play" room. Except for some 
disconnected wires here and there, everything looked 
as if it hadn't been touched since the beginning of the 
century-especially EJ Centro. If you think about it, a 

~ttle dust on -some warehouses can really depress the 
hell out of you.

Wage-Price Controls 
Opposed By Experts 

WASHINGTON - Six men who served as chief economic 
advisors to President Carter's four most recent predecessors 
testified yesterday that mandatory government controls on 
wages a nd prices are not the solution for today's inflation. 

Herbert Stein, chairman of the Council of J::conomic Advisers 
during the Nixon administra tion- when controls were last 
used - said : "Anyone who is old enough to have lived through 
the experience of 1971-74 a nd still believes in controls is beyond 
my powers. of persuasion." 

The six economists found themselves in agreement with 
Carter, who has vowed repealedly that he would not impose 
controls. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy. Carter's chief opponent for 
the Democratic presidential nomination , has endorsed controls. 

The six were not so sure what should be done to whip inflation. 
T heir recommendations ranged from tax rewards for workers 
who hold down wage demands , to helping balance the budget by 
imposing a stiff tax on gasoline. 

Liberals Arthur Ok un and Walter Heller endorsed a reduction 
in Social Security taxes . Conservative Paul McCracken left 
open the door to an income-tax cut to offset the effects of 
inflation on taxes. 

The economists testified before the Senate Banking 
Committee as Carter 's economic and budget advisors continued 
closed·door sessions with cong,essionalleaders. They are trying 
to agree on a package of spending cuts that is expected to 
become a part of Carter 's anti-inflation proposal this week or 
next. 

There is general agreement among economists that even if 
Congress succeeds in slashing $20 billion from Carter's 
proposed $616 billion budget for 1981 , that would reduce the 
current 18-percent annual rate of inflation by only one·third to 
two·thirds of a percentage point. 

However, those who favor reductions say the psychological 
impact of announcing that the federal government means to hold 
down spending would be even more important. 

Alice Rivlin, director of the C;:ongressional Budget Office , in 
testimony before the House Budget Committee, expressed 
skepticism about the effects of budget cuts but conceded , "We 
a re in a very extraordinary situation in which symbols are 
important. "

Transplants Spur

LONDON - Seven dying 
Englishmen have been given 
new hearts in the past seven 
months. After more than a 
decade of discouraging faijure 
on the operating table, British 
surgeons are scoring rousing 
successes in heart transplant 
operations.

While Reed said the couocil 
would not take another similar 
action and would apologize for 
the incident, they did not feel 
they had acted wrongly. 

"In retr05pect it was too 
much trouble for what it was 
worth, but it Wa5 neceuary," 
said Reed. 

According to council 
member Sergio Santos, the 
council felt they needed to 
keep their ~Ians a secret for 
fear that if Third Dean Beverly 
Varga knew about the name, 
she would be subject to 
p,euure lrom Third -Provost 
Joseph Wallon. 

Varga, who is .known for 
taking positions f student 
advocacy, said yesterday that 
she would not have been 
pressured by Wallon. 

Irene Flores, who resigned 
from the Council in protest of 
their decision to withhold the 
minutes, said they did so 

because of their "contempt" 
for other students. 

Flores said the council used 
deprecating language about 
their fellow students saying 
"what do they know." 

" I do not want them 
representing me if they are not 
going to even respect their 
forum," she said. 

Both the council and Flores 
and Ortiz said last night they 
hoped a recall would not be 
necessary. Both sides say they 
are acting in the "students' 
interest" and that a recall 
would hinder the council at a 
time when it has more pressing 
concerns. 

But, Ortiz said that if he 
needed to be convinced the 
Council would not be 
"deceitful" again. "I would 
ra ther have no Council than a 
deceitful one," he said. 

According to Varga and the 
students involved in the clash, 
the problem is heightened by 
personal animosities .

Peace Corps, VISTA Here 
With 5000 Spots to Fill 

BY AUCE ROCKEY 
A recruiter for the Peace Corps and VISTA, 

armed with positions for over 5,000 volunteers 
this year, is interviewing seniors today in the 
Career Planning and Placement Office. 

Both the Peace Corps and VISTA are 
agencies of a federally funded program called 
"Action." The mutual goal of these agencies is to 
"help developing communities realize their 
potential for growth." 

Peace Corps volunteers serve worldwide in 
developing countries and VISTA volunteers 
serve in low income communities in the U.S. 

What do Action volunteers do? Michael 
Hulfachor, Coordinator for the Humanities and 
Social Science Career Services Center, was a 
VISTA volunteer for a year and a half, starting 
in 1973. A Muir sociology major, he went to 
work in Austin , Texas as a VISTA volunteer 
and served in a federally funded community 
action program. 

He worked on landlord-tenant relations, a 
food co-op, and an educational project. He lived 
in the community he was serving (a VISTA 
requirement), mainly with "chicanos , blacks and 
poor whites. " He was given a living allowance by 
VIST A for room and board. 

Hulfachor says he had two reasons for 
volunteering. One was because "he was 
idealistic-wanted to make a contribution to the 
community" and the other was because he

11;1 response to the query of how his VIST A 

work prepared him for the job market and 
enhanced eligibility, Hulfachor replied that "it 
helped me define my own abilities to a greater 
degree-both strengths and weaknesses." 

Adams Looks at UC 
Continued from Palle 1 
campus. Maybe this is as good a system as was 
avai lable," Adams said . 

How did the committee operate so long 
without telling him he was a finalist? 

Adams isn' t sure, but he has a guess that 
committee members say is pretty accurate. 

"Suppose that what they wanted to have was a 
half dozen candidates to look at, and '8 lot of 
them dropped out. Suddenlv, they found 
themselves with just one or two lelt, and they're a 
lot closer to finishing than they thought." he says. 

Two of the candidates for the post dropped out 
within the last month, the search committee has 
said. 

So the search hasn't scared Adams. but 
Proposition 9 has - a little . 

" It is a serious consideration in deciding 
whether to come to California. Proposition 9 is a 
challenge to the existence of the UC system as

China Lets Bada Date 'Peking Man' 
Scripps Scientist's Amino Acid Method Is Ticket limit of 30,000 years, costs about $400 a sample and 

takes several months to 
generate a date. BY MARK WILSON 

Using his newly developed 
fossil age-dating technique, 
Scripps organic ' chemist 
Jeffery Bada recently became 
the first Western scientist since 
World War II to view and 
work with the renowned 
"Peking Man" remains. 

"I'm the first Western 
scientist to work on these 
fossils, even touch them, since 
1940," Bada says, speaking 

of the bones from the famed 
Zhoukoudian site where the 
"Peking Man" was first 
discovered. 

"Peking Man," he says, 
"was probably the most 
extensive collection of homo 
erectus that has ever been 
found. Parts of about 18 
human skeletons were found 
among many more animal 
bones ." 

Bada explains that many of

~--------------------------~ 

the "Peking Man" skeletons 
were lost in the confusion of 
World War II . Until recently, 
the Chinese would not allow 
Westerners to enter China to 
study their heritage. 

Despite their self.imposed 
scientific isolation, the Chinese 
expressed interest in Bada's 
amino acid dating process. 

"The whole problem with 
the Zhoukoudian site is that 
there was no method that 
could have been used to date 
the bones. It was an undated 
site," Bada says. Bada 's 
dating technique is based on a 
c hemical reaction called 
racemization. 

"All the amino acids in a 
living system are of the L-
configuration," Bada 
explains. "Once an organism 
dies, a process called 
racemization begins in which 
the L-amino acids are 
converted to the D-amino 
acids. This continues until 
there are equal amounts of the 
two isomers in the system." 

If the conversion rate is 
known, the age of the sample 
can be easily computed. The 
other major dating technique 
currently used is the Carbon· 
14 system which, according 
to Bada. has an upper dating 

"But amino acid dating 
probably costs on the order of 
$100 per sample, has a limit of 
several hundred thousand 
years and has a tum around 
time of as little as two days ," 
Bada says. 

Whil~ in the People 's 
Republic, Bada gave about 40 
lectures at various research 
centers. Most of his visits were 
made at the Institute of 
Geochemistry in Guiyang, 
working with Chinese 

The Daily Guardian 

Science 
scientists. 

"Unfortunately, they were 
limited by their inexperience in 

. doing this kind of geochemis. 
try as well as by the facilities 
and eqUipment they had," 
Bada notes . He cites 
incidences of earching a local 
glass blower for beakers and 
the hospital for "disposable 
pipettes" . 

Bada discovered from his 
studies that some of the fossils 
were as old as 400,000 years. 
" I have by no means 

completed my project. It looks 
as if I'll be able to invite some 
of them (the Chinese 
scientists) to come here,and 
work in my lab for six to nine 
months," he says. 

"I imagine that I wiU 
continue this for several years 
or so, " Bada concludes, 
exp la ining that his new 
process will continue to be 
used to date previously 
"undatable" items.

University Hospital Helicopter Takes to Air

University Hospital Helicopter Takes to Air 
BY PETER MORTENSEN 

Science Editor 
After almost a year of 

difficult state and local 
planning, UCSD'. Life Flight 
emergency helicopter will take 
to the air next Monday, 
serving residents of the San 
Diego and surrounding areas 
on a 24-hour basis. 

Following the Monday 
dedication ceremony on the 
University Hospital Out-

he~copter will be on an 18-
month trial granted by the 
Office of Statewide Health 
Planning and Development.

programs in the country, 
including three in California, 
this is the first state.approved

The helicopter will also be 
able to transport patients from 
one medical facility to another 
if necessary. 

"The paramedical systems 
in most cities can handle mosl 
of the emergency cases_ The 
small, hard-to-reach areas are 
the problem," says William 
Baxt, medical director of the 
Life Flight unit. He expressed 
concern for residents in rural 
and back country areas of the 
8,000 square mile service 
area, explaining that the 
helicopter should dramatically 
increase response time to 
them. 

The craft has a cruising 
range of 130 miles per hour

Helicopter 
Airborne 

Adams Looks at UC System 
Continued from page 6 
foot·diameter space. Its fuel 
cruising range reaches 350 
miles in optimum flight 
conditions. 

Funding for the Life Flight 
J>!0gram came in part from the 
UCSD Medical Center 
Auxiliary, and from La 
Patro'nas and Pacific 
Southwest Airlines. 

Emergency service is 
expected to cost each patient 
an average of $200. This 
charge includes $1 per mile for 
the hospital round trip . 

Continued from page 4 
the country has come to know 
it. 

"But you have to be careful 
about that kind of thinking. 
The whole country is in a state 
of flux in higher education. If 
there's a Proposition 9 in 
California in 1980, you might 
see the same thing in New 
York in 1981. And private 
universities have money 
problems, too, though they are 
of a different character. 

"But it all comes down to 
the same bottom line, which is 
less money for higher 
education," Adams believes. 

AlTlNDON: 
SOENCE GRADUATES 

Immediate Openlnp 
In Our AdvAnCed R&..D Ubs 

If you're a recent lCience graduate, or planning on graduation 
within six monthe, we have poeitione ~aiting for you in our top 
HAD lab.. A degree in phyma, math or other related lCientific 
fielda may al80 qualify you for a bi-Iateral degree in Electrical 
EnPleering. 
The Air Force IMtitute ofTechnolOty, rated 4th in the country, 
ia offering an IS-month coune leading to a BSEE degree. You 
could be eaming over '1,000 a month .. a aecond lieutenant, 
while attending achool free. 
If you'd rather wait to get your BSEE degree, preatigiou8 
poeitionl are now available in our R&D labe, working with the 
lateet .tate-of-the-art technology. For more detailed 
information, call Ron Canfield, (714) 293-5737, 3443 Camino 
del Rio South, #120, San Dier,?, CA. 92018. 

If Proposition 9 passes, he 
thinks tuition will be 
necessary. 

"You'il be given a set of 
alternatives. One is to undergo 
cutbacks that are extraordi-
narily severe. Another is to 
impose tuition. It you want to 
keep the university as a 
graduate training or research 
institution, I see no way other 
than to make them pay for that 
education to keep the 
university in a position of 
excellence. It would be a 
mistake to let that excellence 
wash away." 

Students, he believes, will 
not have a major role in 
spending that systemwide. 
imposed tuition, nor does 
Adams think they will have a 
large role in the way faculty 
decisions are made. 

"At Chicago, which is a 
private university of course , 
students have a relatively 
minor role in the way things 
are done and professors are 
evaluated. I understand that 
the evaluations at San Diego 
are well done , but that the 
student role in governance is 
not all that different from 

(Chicago)," he says. 
Adams, who has spent 

virtually his whole adult life at 
Chicago, doesn't anticipate 
staying here long even if he is 
appointed chancellor. 

"There's a great deal to be 
said for limited and definitive 
terms of office. Eight years as 
chancellor (Mc Elroy's tenure 
in the post) seems more than 
enough to me. Of course, there 
are problems kee ping 
programs going a nd looking 
after what you've started, but 
there's a lot 10 be said for 
circulation in a university, in 
keeping things going. "
