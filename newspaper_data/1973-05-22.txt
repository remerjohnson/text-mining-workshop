John Muir College: Goals of Town Council 
To ~ather the Muir students together and organize next years' governance, a Town 

Meeting has been called for Thursday May 24, in the North Dining Commons at 7 pm. 
In the past the Muir College Council has been a motivating force behind the 

Curriculum changes and the establishment of the Curriculum Review and Develop-
ment Board. It kept the administration from cementing the area around 2C and 2D. It 
established the policy of 'first come-first serve' with regards to parking in the Muir lots. 
(This policy is no longer in effect). The students on the committee have been 
instrumental in the selection of the college and resident deans. 

This year's members were Ian Boase, Lincoln Cushing, Stephanie Harris, Jeff Unsicker 
and Mark Whisler, with Tom Leanse and Les Paver each serving for half a term. Perhaps 
the best expression of Muir College came from a paper written last year by Boase. My 
thoughts about the Muir College Council and Muir College. _ 

My study of the problems of the Muir College Council has somehow engendered 
many deeper personal questions about the Council and my role as a student at Muir 
College. Specifically, this year I recognized that the most important things I was learning 
here at UCSD were coming from my experience on the Muir College Council. As I 
became more and more involved in the Council, I came to be concerned with my own 
frustration and other's and the feeling that the Council simply wasn't doing anything ... 

I thought a lot about something I called "increased student-faculty interaction" 
(which I find appallingly lacking at Muir) and actually got scme ideas down as to how 
the .Cou~cil could build a sense of "community" so as to promote interaction. I finally 
realized Just two weeks ago, however, that all of my ideas were based on individual 
work, not on the collective work of the Council. As I thought about it, I found that in 
fact there was nothing the Council could do to bring about "increased student-faculty 
interaction," or a "community" sense. 

Of course, facilitating interaction is not the only job the Council can or should do. 
There are policy and administrative areas which demand student (and faculty) input and 
the Council should serve as a forum for such input. But there is an extreme need for 
" getting people together" at Muir whether they be students or faculty. As I came to 
realize this pressing need, I began thinking about the Council. 

~hen I' began this study, I laid out a couple of basic assumptions as the basis from 
which I would work . These assumptions were that : 

1) The Muir College Council's existence and the need for the Council were not in 
question; I was interested only in "making the Council work better." 

2) The "representativeness" of the Council was not important : the Council members 
were elected by a constituency, but from that point on, there was no need for carrying 
on the farce of "representation." 

These two assumptions, I suddenly realized, were and are out growths of the primary 
proble~ the Council has always been faced with but never recognized: because the 
Cou~c." was created "from the top down" by a small group of students, faculty and 
admlnrstrators, there has never been any broad based support for the Council either 
from faculty or students. I believe that because the Council has no official status within 
the "power structure," because it has no "Power," it must take power. But to do this it 
must have .broad based support from groups within the College. Thus, it must b 
representative and have ~he r~c?gni!ion, respect and cooperation of the groups it 
suppo~edly represents. With this In mind, both of the above assumptions are invalid if 
one Wishes the Council become anything more than an advisory group to the Provo t of 
the College. To have the Council "work better, it must s rv ne ds based on th f eling 
of· the people at th College. 
. AIt~ough I had vaguel~ recognized these fac s befor , I cho e to ignore th m by 
inS rtl~g ~he two assumptions above. The rea on I ignored them is simpl : I kn w that 
the maJorrty of people (If not everyone) at Muir either didn't know th Coun il exist d 
or more importantly, didn't really care if such a council exi ted or not. 

~hen I finally ':faced up" to the situation and took sto k of th impli ations, I 
realized that ~,hat IS ~eally nee~~~ at Muir is a "gra s-roots" movement to b brought 
ab.ou~, f~r a cons lousness raising" ph nomenon to happen. At thi time, I was 
thl~klng In t r.ms of a goal of creating a "mass following" for th Muir Coli g a notion 
whl h, as I wll.1 relate c~n eq~ently, I found to be contradictory to what wa rally 
n d d at MUir. I wa stili trying to impo e a movement from "the top down." 

My initial rea tion .to. what. I hav talked about 0 far wa to simply go on with my 
r port on th Councll,.lgnorrng all of my thoughts and fe ling about th true, ba i 
pro?1 m of th CouncIl. B.ut I could not do it. I f It that I was thinking and writing a 
t rrl vacuum; I wa working on problem that wer meaningl if the ba i qu ti n 

of the people's need was not worked out. How could I write a report on the problems 
of and solu tions for the College Council when I had come to feel the group was 
completely our of touch with the realities, with the needs of Mu ir College, particularly 
the needs of Muir students?.. . 

The following is a list of all the committees on wh ich students serve. Included are 
descriptions wr itten by current rep resentatives on a number of the committees. 

Ad Hoc Beach Development Committee, Advisory Committee fro University Center 
and Cluster Center development- Advisory Committee for University Registration 
Fees- This committee is primarily responsible for the d ispursement of the university 
registration fee . They review all current programs, which consists primarily of student 
services and also hear proposals for projects on the campus. 

The committee has a sub-committee which mak most of its major deci ions. 
Se ond Quarter the sub-committee, comprised only of students, meets and 
decides how to spend the $100 Registration Fee each student pays every quarter. 
For UCSD that totals to about $2 million . To stay informed and attend all the 
meetings takes about 15-20 hours per week, for most of Winter quarter. During the 
year the full committee meets sporadically, and deals with additional budget 
requests and or deletions. The following is the budget for 1973-74, as it wa 
submitted to Chancellor MacElroy. 

Bookstore Advisory Committee, Campus Community Relations Advisory Committee, 
Campus Planning Committee, Campus Program Board- Campus-wide committee 
responsi ble for providing balanced programming and entertainment of high quality 
that is cqnsistent with the educational pruposes of the UC 0 community. The receive 
funding from the Regents, Registrat ion Fees, and the Campus Activi tee Fees. 

Communication Board , Council for Undergraduate Affairs, Equal Employment 
Opportunites for Women, Housing Polic Committee, Intercollegiate Athleti cs Advi ory 
Committee, International Center Governing Board, Long Range Plann ing Committee, 
Parking Advisory Committee-An advisory committe to the Vice-Chance llor Busines 
and they help to set the rates and plan the park ing needs of the UCSD community. 

Program Review Committee-This committee is the prinCipal advisory committee on 
campus funding . They al 0 review curr nt requirements for campus resources again t 
new and existing resource allocations and provide the Chancellor with allocation . There 
are two subcommittees; capital outlay and space and budget allo ation and 
program. " This year it supervised the development of our 1974-75 Target Budget 
Request and reviewed the University' Major Capital Improvement Program." Deborah

Jeff Blklr 
Revelle College has 

some outdated and overly-
conservative ideals that 

. need changing. Revelle 
needs to allocate more 
funds to the creation of a 
broader scope of classes as 
well as recreational ac-
tivities in the interest of all 
students. The Revelle stu-
dent of ten years ago has 
changed. Programs and 
policies of Revelle must 
change accordingly. The 
college needs a more 
divergent faculty consisting 
of all ethnic groups. My 
primary reason for running 
is to try to make some of 
these changes. The time 
has long passed for a II 
students to have a bigger 
voice at Revelle. 

. It is becaUSE I am in -
terested in improving the 
life of the Revel e Student 
that I am reru n IIi '16 for :l 
posit io n on th.· Revelle 
Committee of )I~ ge Af-
fa irs. In this last ~ ~r I have 
fought vehemer.1ly to get 
more extra-curr;cular ac-
tiviti S.lI R v lie and to 
s that the Administration 
does not turn a deaf ear 
to th voices of the 
stud nts. I feel that my past 
experi nce in high school 
as well as coli ge gover-
nanc and my pOSition on 
th TIlITON TIMES w II 
qualifies me to repreesen! 
the sutud nts again next 

year on ' the RCCA. With 
your support, we can make 
Revelle not just a place of 
education , but a place of 
all around enjoymentnt. 

RIck DrOll 
What is Revelle College? 
Revelle isnot USB 2722. 

Revelle is no! the Provost 
Office. It is not a lab or 
building . 

Revelle is 2,400 students 
interested in getting a real 
educa tion. 

Too often Revelle is co n-
fused with its re -
quirements, its professors 
or i ts location . Passi ng 
finals seem to be the only 
goals for students. 

I want to work to change 
this next year. I have 
lea rned to be effective on 
committees throu gh my 
work o n the Resi dence 
Hall Board and the RCCA. 

Next year, if elected, I 
will work to make Reve lle 
more than just a name. 

Robert D. Frlncls 
I am servi ng on the com-

mittee this year . I feel that 
this experience well help 
me be more effec-
tive than a r,ew member. 

One of my main interests 
is the curricuulum at 
Revelle. Some of the se-
quences , such as 
Humanities, have lost 
much of their value 
because the courses are 
not integrated together. As 
a committee me~r, I 
have raised this issu in the 
past, and I will continue to 
do so. However, I don't 
think all of the sequences 
should be abolished just 
because they have some 
things wrongs with them. 

I feel that any proposal 
for a new A.5., including 
the one made by the 
Students' Life and Interest 
Committee, should be put 
to a vote in a student 
refe rendum. Among these 
proposals there could b 
one in which AS 
membership would be 
voluntary.

I want to be on the 
RCCA so that it will truly 
represent a cross section of 
Revelle Students (eq ual 
representation for all) . As a 
Chicano, I will primarily 
support the activities of the 
minorities, keeping in 
mind the cultural benefits 
that all students will 
receive from such ac-
tivities. This does not mean 
that I will not consider 
other students and their 
activities. If any activity, 
whatever it may be, brings 
variety and fun for the ma-
jority of the students, I will 
strongly support it. 

Ifeel that the pr imary 
duty of the RCCA is to 
sti mulate interaction 
among students, between 
the colleges , and among 
faculty member s and 
students. The committee 
should always try to create 
the ri ght atmo sp.here 
whereby students feel that 
they are human beings and 
not stud yin g machines. 
Student interests are what 
the RCCA should always 
consider through activities 
ranging from concerts and 
dances to special shows, 
lectures, and seminars con-
cerni ng national affairs in-
volving college students. 
(e.g. Wounded Knee, 
UFWO) 

Chris Himmel 
One of Revelle College's 

major deficiencies is its 
lack of diversi ty among 
non-classroom activities. It 
is essentia l that Reve ll e 
make a broad range of op-
portunities available to the 
students. A college is in an 
excellent position to spon-
sor many diverse programs 
and events. The college 
must be receptive to those 
opportunities which pre-
sent themselves, and work 
to attract others not so 
readily available. This not 
only provides a wider 
variety of experiences 
available to students but it 
also helps to attract a 
va ried student bod y to 
Revel le. As a member of 
RCCA I will be able to 
work toward improvi ng 
Revelle in these important 
ways. 

K.llfh MolS 
I am a transfer student 

from Claremont Men's 
College and this is my f irst 
year at Revelle College. I 
f I that using this year's 
exp rienc in conjunction 
with experience gain d at 
CM C makes it possible for 
m to b Iter survey cam-
pus affai rs and con tribute 

effectively. In my first 
year here I have worked 
with the Flicks, KSDT, and 
the Hall Chairman ' s V 
Board in various social 
functions. I am interested 
in putting out the effort 
and time for this campus 
because I l ive here too, and 
I know there's foo room 
for improvement. The 
RCCA seems like useful 
outlet for my energy. 

NIc~olls PI,.,..lol 
Apath y is gripping 

Revelle College; the stu-
dent government wa s 
abolished last year, thi,~ 
year, " the government 
has been little heard and 
less effective. I refuse to 
accept apathy and an in-
effective student govern-
ment; for this reason, I am 
a candidate for the Revelle 
Committee on College Af-
fairs. I am will ing to spend 
my time and energy to 
change this situation, to 
make the student 
government a worthwhile 
and effective instrument 
for improving Student Life. 

Blrry Rothstein 
I have been living on and 

attending Revelle College 
for two yea rs. Over the past 
year I have been active on 
Hall Chairman's Board and 
have worked with the 
Friday and Saturday Films 
on campus. In addition, I 
have worked with several 
of the various governing 
boards and groups. In this 
way I have gained con-
siderab le experience in 
deali ng with the on-
campus organizations, ex-
perience which would 
make me qualified and 
useful to the RCCA. 

Sulln Schiefer 
The students have shown 

that they don't want stu-
dent governmen t to 
become a major obsession 
on this ca mpus. Student 
invol.vement in campus 
government shou ldn ' t be 
perpetuated for the sake of 
status seek r s and 
apologias for th e ad-
ministration's decis ions, 

but for the sake of opening 
communications and 
passing information. I want 
to participatenot for the 
purpose of belonging to an 
elitest organization, but to 
serve as a liason between 
t h e adminis trat io n and 
those students who aren't 
on the committee. 

PII"s.I~ 
One of the major 

problems I see here at 
UCSD is the lack of effec-
tive communication 
between students and their 
elected representatives to 
student government. This 
year as a Hall Chairmen 
and as a member of 
Residence Hall Board, I 
feel I've started to budge 
this communication gap by 
help ing to plan much 
needed social events and 
by participating in policy 
decisions affecting Revelle 
sutudents. With last year's 
dissolution of the 
" Associated Students", it is 
more important than ever 
that the students make 
their voice heard. I would 
like to continue being your 
representativeplease vote 
for Paula Smith! 

Sue Stowlll 

I am a sophomore 
Chemistry-Earth-Science 
Major in my last two years 
at Revelle College. I have 
been active in Revelle Resi-
dent Hall Committees. I am 
presently on the Revelle 
Resident Hall Board, the 
gobverning board for the 
Reve lle Dorms. Having 
been on this board, I have 
had a chance to work on 
many problems that 
affect about one fourth of 
Revelle'S Student Body. 
Having had this experience 
, I feel that I am well 
prepared to help in the 
running of Revelle as a 
whole. 

IeII Trlllt..-
It is unfortunate when 

libraries and classrooms are 
th e only places to go on 
thi s campus . I used to 
believe that they were, but 
my involvement with the 
Residence Hall Board has 
hown me otherwise. I was 
unaware (as are perhaps 
most students) of the 
number of things that can 
be accomplished movies, 
dances, guest speakers, 
performa nces of the 
Chicago Symphony String 
Quartet if students j ust 
voice their ideas. 

I want to see the RCCA 
become a more represen-
tative and more effective 
group. Revelle needs a 
greater variety of ac-
tivities and, more impor-
tantly, goals. We need to 
articulate our concern for 
good government on all 
levels, for the protection of 
our environment, for the 
protection of our rights; 
the RCCA is one of the 
pla ces to begin . I offer my 
time and energy in mak ing 
something more than just a 
hollow, tasteless education 
out of our stay at Revelle.

If you happened to come by the gym Sunday, you 
were one of the lucky people treated to a rare display 
of truly fine intramural volleyball. Seventeen mixed 
doubles teams showed up bright and early hoping for a 
big day of volleyball, and they got just that. The teams 
were divided into four pools with four teams each 
except for one pool with five. Round robin play was 
held in each pool with the winners playing each other 
in a four-team single-elimination playoff. 

The play was hard and clean all day and featured 
some highlights sue,", as Lemon Grove breaking 
another one 0 f Jeff Gorrell's beach chairs (his third of 
the yearl) . A big surprise was the appearance on the 
volleyball court of Nancy Acton . She spends so much 
time on the softball field that it was rumored that her 
fuzzy-faced (the "fuzzy" could be eliminated) partner 
from up north had to lock her in a closet between 
games to keep her from leaving him for a softball game. 

Some great play was displayed by Burning Desire ( 
teamed with Cheryl Elliot) who was skying as if he had 
never hurt his knee, and by Dave and Sioux. Also 
surprisingly sharp were Chris and Randy who put on a 
very impressive shol\'. It all finally came down to 
Frenchy Fuqua and Soupie winning one poll, Tom 
Smith and Karen Pacior winning their'S, and Joan 
Roberts and Dwight Bean winning theirs. In the other 
pool, Turkey Condon and Laurie Dunlap gave up teheir 
spot in the playoffs to the second place team of Brian 
Bowen and Linda Maczko because it was getting late -
pretty shaky excuse. 

The playoffs featured more excellent play, although 
people were beginning to show the effects of a long 
exhausting day of competition. Linda and Brian finally 
managed to subdue LeLevier and Soupie, who was 
hampered by her bad Achilles tendon which finally 
caught up with her, not to mention a cold which by 
now has probably developed into double pneumonia. 
Meanwhile, Dwight hammered home just enough of

Crew Lightweights 

Tritons Fourth On The Coast. 
Friday and Saturday the 

UCSD crew team matched 
their skills against fifteen 
other schools on the chop-
py waters of lexington 
Reservoir in a very hot and 
dry Los Gatos, California. 
Since Thursday could be 
heard coxswains' cries for 
"set-up" as they begged 
for a stable keel on the 
wind-blown course. These 
were the sights and sounds 
of the 1973 Western Sprint 
Championships. 

The qualifying heats of 
Friday were exhausting as 
UCSD's shells each had to 
ra ce twice during the 
sunrise-to-su nset 
marathon rowing spec-
tacular. By dusk as the haze 
began setting over the 
course, the lightweights 
had shown through by 
qualifying for the Petite 

Women 
Place 
Third 

Final in the eight-oared 
shell a nd for the Grand 
Final inn the four . The 
Freshman Four rowed a 
strong second race (7:07 
for 200 meters) to qualify 
for the Grand Final. During 
their second race, the 
lightweight Four (LW IV) 
set a new school record of 
7:06.2 over the mile-and-a-
quarter length .. 

Saturday's times proved 
a bit slower for the earlier 
events as the wind kicked 
up as much trouble as the 
very unstable racing shells 
could handle. The Frosh 
Four fell behind to the 
University of Washington 
and San Diego State and 
were unable to make 
sounds amends as their 
season closed with an im-
pressive fourth on the West 
Coast. The Lightweight 
Eight (A together team 
consisting of the L WIV in 
the stern and four 
freshman lightweights in 
the bow) rowed strongly to 
take fourth yielding to 

UCSB by only one-tenth of 
a second. 

The LWIV (also known as 
the "hot dog four") 
grabbed a g fast start a over 
all boats as their race 
quickly developed into a 
dual contest between 
UCSD and UCLA. 

At the half-way point 
(1000 meters) the boats 
remained separated by less 
than half a second as the 
crews entered the roughest 
part of the course. With 
wind and waves upsetting 
the "even keel" of the 
shel ls as well as playing 
havoc with the oars, the 
competitors brutally 
jumped into an all muscle 
and no grace situation. 
Without the swing 
rhythmic timing of body

fighting the boat's rock and

one of complete panic as 
all possible energies were

Pueblo Rechazado 

Steiman Interviews Tito Pueblo Rcchazado, a theatrical work by Vicente Lenero, is truly one of Mexico's best contemporary-documental example of it's theater arts. The scenery for the play is formed with a base of a 
conjuction of esoteric symbols, in which appear the 
three crosses representing the profane world, ce lls 
representing the monastery and music representing a 
universal seal. 

Hank Steiman 

Recently I had the great pleasure of meeting and 
speaking with a great world leader, a man of infinite 
wisdom, a true humanitarian, and a real "fruit cake" 
Yugoslavia's dictator Marshall Tito. 

Tito was born on Christmas Day in Bethlehem, much 
to his parents' urprise. His parents named him 
Marshall, after his Uncle Arturo . Tito's childhood was a 
sad and tragic affair. Living in a state of extreme 
poverty, Marshall's parents were frequently forced into 
placing him in BEKI S storage for months at a time. 
When Marshall was eight, his mother ran off with the 
town taxidermist. He didn't see her for twenty years, 
unti l one day, while strol ling through a local museum, 
he looked up and found his mother's head mounted 
on a wall next to a moose. As for Tito 's father, he was a 
simple tailor who was later arrested for practicing 
gynecology without a license. 

In 1953, Tito was elected President of Yugoslavia 
because nobody else wanted the job. Presently, Presi-
dent Tito remains the Supreme leader in Yugoslavia, 
while holding a part-time job during the summer as a 
Safeway boxboy. 

Just recently, I received a personal invitation to dine 
with President Tito and his wife at the Presidential 
Palace, an offer that I readily accepted. 

I arrived at the Palace and was immediately escorted 
down a long corridor by two guys who look like they 
spend their weekends loitering in front of the local 
Y.M.CA. I was tilen ushered into a huge room which 
was well-furnished , nicely decorated, and adequately 
air-conditioned. I immediately spotted Tito who was 
sitting at his desk and, at the moment, was removing his 
hair curlers. I quickly introduced myself to the Presi-
dent, we exchanged pleasantries, and then I remarked 
to Tito how much he resembled Max Lipsky, my 
butcher . Afterwards I was introduced to Tito's wife 
Ruby who is a very sweet woman, but one look at her 
body could only suggest " a GOODYEAR blimp in pedal 
pushers. II

After exchanging some more pleasantries, we sat 
down to dinner. Tito's wife brought out a good-
looking tray full of assorted Hebrew National Coldcuts. 
Tito remarked to me how much he takes pride in 
"keeping a Kosher table." I devoured the coldcuts as if 
they were going out of style. A few seconds later, Mrs. 
Tito brought out some Matzo Ball soup and a side 
order of her famous cole slaw. After I told the President 
how much I enjoyed his wife's cooking, Tito replied, 
"You should see her Baked Clams Casino; they melt in 
your mouth." As we ate, I asked Mrs. Tito about the 
lovely silverware, and she said she had just won it on 
"Let's Make a Deal." During the meal I told the 
President that I would be honored if he would allow 
me to conduct an interview with him. He graciously 
accepted the request, and so we commenced: 

TT: President Tito, what do you think of the present 
world situation, particularly in Europe? 

Tito: Could you please pass the cole slaw. 
TT: Yes, of course, Mr. President. Now, Mr. Presi-

dent, how does the present situation in Europe shape 
up right now? 

Tito: Uh, could you pass the potato salad. 
TT: Certainly, Mr. Tito, Now, where were we? Oh 

yes, I was asking you about ... . 
lito: Where's the pumpernickel? (turning to his wife) 

Honey, could we have some more bread? Now, go 
ahead; what were you asking, young man? 

TT: President Tito, oh, may I call you Marshall? By the 
way, is Marshall your real name? 

Tito: No, my real name is Connie Stevens. 
TT: I see . Now, what about Europe, Mr. President? 
Tito: Well, Banana Nose, it's a good place to pick up 

broads! 
TT: What do you do when you're not running the 

country; what do you do to relax? 
TT: Um, may we talk about your country? 
Tito: Yes, of course; what do you want to know, Taco 

Breath? 
TT: Well , in regard to your country's trade, what does 

Yugoslavia import? 
Tito: Beef Burritos. 
H: What does your country export? 
Tito: Stray dogs. (Tito interjects) 
Tito: ow, let me ask you one, Bozo. 
TT: Alright. 
Tito: How much wood could a woodchuck chuck, if 

a wood chuck could chuck wood? 
TT: I don't know. But how much ground could a 

groundhog grind, if a groundhog could grind ground? 
Tito: I'm not sure. But would you like to see my 

appendix scar? 
TT: Never mind. Could we get back to the interview, 

please? 
Tito: By all means. 
TT: By all means. 
TT: Mr. President, how are your country's 

relations with the Soviet Union? Are you and Premier 
Kosygin on friendly terms? 

Tito: Can I tell you a little secret? Promise you won't 
tell? 

TT: I promise. 
Tito: Kosygin's a queerl 
TT: How can you tell? 
Tito: Well, during our last summit meeting, he kept 

pinching me. 
TT: Oh Brother! That's just wonderful. 
In closing, President Tito, do you have a philosophy 

of Life that perhaps you could relate to our readers? 
lito: Yes, to me "Life is like a bus depot, full of 

weirdos." 
I then asked Tito what that meant. He said he wasn't 

sure, but added that he'd probably know by Thursday, 
in case I wanted to come back . 

With that our interview ended.

" PUEBLO RECHAZAoO" BY VICENTE LENERO On 

June 1?, 1967, the priest Gregorio Lemercier, founder 
and prior member of the Santa Maria of the Resurrec-
ti?n Mo.n.astery, situ.ated near Cuernavaca, made public 
hiS deCISion to resign the "Exercises of the Catholic 
Sacerdotal Hierachy"~ and that of his community to 
resign the monasteric robes and to cut the ties that 
subjugated them to the actual monasteric structures of 
the Confederation Benedicta and other religious 
congregations. 

He wanted to create a new community absolutely 
original for the importance given to personal con-
science. They were united by the common confidence 
in the technical medium of psychoanalysis. 

Lemercier's decision and that of his d'isciples was the 
final point in a long conflict with the Vatican 
authorities. The conflict came about the implementa-
tion of psychoanalysis in the Santa Maria de la 
Resurreccion Monastery.

Le Cong Phung Replies To Charges Of North 

Vietnamese Propaganda By Kevin Olson 
Mr. Olson : 

I am glad that you read 
my article. 

A.- In that article, I called 
"progressive people" 
those who oppose the US 
policy in Vietnam and 
therefore support the 
struggle of the Vietnamese. 
But you try to interprete 
that only Communist 
leaders support the Viet-
namese people. You com-
pletely ignore that: 

1.- Pope Paul, Sweden's 
Premier Olof Palme, U.N. 
Secretary General Kurt 
Waldheim, West Ger-
many's Chancellor Willy 
Brandt, pro-American 
British labor leader Roy 
Jenkins, Rep. Sen. Willram 
Saxbe .. .. .. have spoken 
against the US bombings. 

2.- Canada's House of 
Commons unanimously 
passed a resolution 
deploring the US air raids. 

3. - The Australian 
government protested 
directly to Washington. 

4.- Australian maritime 
workers boycotted 
American ships until the 
US stoped bombing North 
Vietnam. 

5.- And hundreds of 
millions of other less 
known people 
demonstrated around the 
world to condemn the US 
air war, including a large 
number of distinguished 
people at UCSD. 

But the really fan-
tastic work of yours is your 
equating North Vietnam 
with Hitler based on the 
following parallels: 

1.- Both NVN and Hitler 
never bombed the US, only 
the US bombed NVN and 
Germany. 

Eastern Europeans nor the 
South Vietnamese desired 
to be enslaved . 

4.- The US came to aid 
East European countries 
and South Vietnam. 

1.- The US declared war 
and bombed Germany 
only after Hitler's sub-
marines sunk American 
ships, but the US interven-
tion in to Vietnam was far 
back in early 1950's even 
before Vietnam was 
divided, and without any 
legal justification. later the 
US gov't had to fake the 
Tonkin Gulf incident. 
Moreover, in order to dis-
guise the US agression, the 
US gov't had to inter-
nat ionalize the war in Viet-
nam by paying a lot of 
money to Philippines, 
Thailand, Korea, ... just to 
get a small number of 
troops from these coun-
tries in Vietnam. 

2.- It is true that Hitler 
invaded East Europe. East 
Europe is not Germany, the 
East Europeans neither 
speak German nor have 
the same history as the 
Germans . But it is 
ridiculous to say that NVN 
invaded SVN, because : 

a.- Vietnam is one whole 
country. The Geneva 
Agreement in 1954 states 
clearly that the 17th 
parallel should not be con-
sidered as political or 
geographical boundary. 
Furthermore, the ceasefire 
agreement just signed by 
the US govt ALSO 
REAFFIRMS THE UNITY 
AND TERRITORIAL 
INTEGRITY OF Vietnam. 

Chairman of labor party, 
Vice Premier Gen. Giap) 
were born in the South, 
and many generals in 
Saigon, including former 
Vice President Ky, were 
born in the North . 

c . - The Pentagon 
Papers, which is a US gOV'! 
official document, show 
that South Vietnam is a 
creation of the US gov't. 

Now, if you call the 
presence 'of Vietnamese in 
Vietnam "invasion", then 
what do you call the 
presence of more than half 
a million US soldiers, who 
were completely different 
with the Vietnamese, in a 
tiny country 12,000 miles 
away from their home, 
with the most powerful 
firepower in the history of 
warfare? 

And by the way, if the 
US bombed NVN because 
NVN "invaded" SVN, then 
why did the US not bomb 
Russia whe n Russia in-
vaded Czechoslovakia in 
1968lt 3.- O f course, 
both Eastern Eropeans and 
Vietnamese do not want to 
be enslaved. That is why 
both have fought 
foreigners : East Eu rope 
against Hitler, Vietnam 
against the Chinese, the 
French, the Japanese, the 
Americans. But one is 
never considered enslaved 
when he is governed by his 
own people, even if that 
gov't. i~ Communist. If the 
Chinese people are 
enslaved by Mao, then why 
did Nixon prais~ the 
Chinese as a great people 
and Communist China as a 

great country during his 
visit to Pek ing? 

4.- Everyone is aware 
that East Europe was 
liberated from Hi tler by 
Russia and not by the US, 
so what aid did you say the 
US gave to East Europe? As 
fo r Vietnam, thanks to the 
"generosi ty" of the US, we 
have, as of Oct. 1972, ac-
cording to the US officia l 
figu r es quo te d in 
Newsweek Oct. 30, 1972: 

Dead : 1,082,81 5 
Civi li an casu al t ies: 1 

out of 35 k i lled, 1 ou t of 15 
wounded 

Refugees: 1,100,000 
US Bombing: 6,800,000 

tons (2,00,000 tons in the 
whole World War II) 

Bomb craters: 26,000,· 
000; millions of acres con-
taminated by bomb 
fragments 

Defoliants: 20,000,000 
gallons wh ich have caused 
an extremely large number 
of birth defects. 

Bulldozing : more than 
1,000,000 acres 

the devastating effects 
of bomb craters and 
bulldozing may be felt for 
centuries, according to 
SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, 
May 72. 

The social effects of the 
US intervention are enor-
mous too: prostitutes, 
beggars, orphans 
numbered up to tens of 
thousands; 200,000 civil ian 
political p risoners in jails 
w it ho u t an y sp eci f ic 
charges. 

With th is kind of aid, 
who needs an enem y? 

C. The fact that refugees 
f lee South does not mea~ 
that they support the pro-
American govt . IN Saigon 
and do not we lcome the 
liberators. Th is statement is 
su bsta n tiate d by t h e 
following facts: 

1.- A very large number 
of people, already under 
the control of the Saigon 
gov'1. do not support that 
gov't. 

2.- Even if these refugees 
wanted to go North, they 
cannot cross the DMZ. 

3.- According to severa l 
Weste r n reporters, 
refugees were actually 
forced to abandon their 
villages by South Viet-
namese and America n 
soldiers in order not to lose 
this population to the 
other side.

Palomar and USD were a 
result of academic pressure 
or apathy. For those two 
matche "e team was only 
able to get toget her six 
play rs, rather than the 
necessary ten . Starting a 
match down 0-2 because of 
defaults proved to be an 
insurmountable deficit 
against these two schools. 

The UCSD team had the 
dept h, abil i t y, and 
coaching to be the best 
team in the league, as they 
proved by beating the top 
two teams. But they lacked 
the desire to be number 
one. This kind of attitude 
by the "varsi ty players" 
mu st have been 
demoralizing for a coach 
that tried to prepare 
meaningful practices, and 
frustrating for the handful 
of players that faithfully 
participated week after 
week in all of the practices 
and matches.

4.- These refugees knew 

. too well that if they stay to 
welcome their liberators 
they will be wiped out by 
American bombs. 

D.- Several hundred 
Vietnamese POW's 
released by Thieu did not 
rus home, but instead sat 
down on the runway .... " 

How do you know these 
men are real POW' s 
released by Thieu and not 
Thieu's men disguised as 
POW's? 

E.- You accused n of 
printing " outrageous lies" . 

Continued from Page 6 

Can you prove which are 
outrageous lies? 

The released American 
pilots said they were tor-
tured , the people who 
visited them in North Viet-
nam sa id that they were 
not. You and I were not in 
North Vietnam, therefore, 
we do not know who is 
telling the truth. But at 
least we ca n use our judge-
ment, as I did in my article, 
to point out contradictions. 
It seems to me that 
whatever people who do 
not have the same plitical 
view point as yours, are lies 
and propaganda . If you are 
dedica ted to truth -seeking, 
I would suggest that you 
and I, together with our 
fr iends, meet someday to 
see where the truth is. If 
you agree, call me at X1745.
