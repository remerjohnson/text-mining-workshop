by ADd)' ScbDelder 
and Mark S&8dIer 

Richard H. Armitage, the 59-
year old Ohio State University 
Vice-president for Student 
Services who drew high 
recommendations from the 
Vice-chancellor of Student 
Affairs Search Committee, was 
named by Chancellor McElroy 
to the vice-chancellorship, 
public information.officer Paul 
West announced Dec. 29,1977. 

McElroy decided to select 
Armitage for the position in 
early Uecember, and Armitage 
replied in a letter dated Dec. 12, 
1977. 

Armitage, in a telephone 
interview with the Triton Times 
last week, said he will not 
assume the vice-chancellor 

post until June, because "it is 
important to finish the Spring 
Quarter budget cycle at Ohio 
State." 

"First choiee" 
McElroy, in a statement 

released last Thursday, said he 
picked Armitage because he 
"was the first choice of the 
faculty, students and staff who 
participated in the search 

- process. He has an excellent 
background and will bring 
strong leadership capabilities 
to our campus." 

Armitage will replace 
George Murphy, who resigned 
last April after ten years at the 
Student Affairs helm. After 
Murphy's resignation, Mc-
Elroy appointed physical 
education chairman Howard 

~:, .... "._., 

Hunt as acting vice-chancellor. 
Hunt will hold the temporar.y 
post until Armitage arrives. 

Last June, McElroy appoint-
ed a search committee, 
comprised of undergraduate 
students, faculty, administra-
tors and staff members, to 
conduct a national search for 
Murphy's successor. 

After sifting through the 160 
applicants for the position, the 
committee settled on seven 
final candidates. Each of the 
finalists visited the campus for 
two days of interviews with 
committee members, selected 
administrators, students and 
staff members and the four 
provosts. 

Four recommendations

Third's Unit 2 at final hurdle 
Final plans for new complex must go to Coastal Panel 

by Alldy Sclulelder 
Auocla&e News Ediaor 

Third College Academic Unit 
II enters the final phase for pre-
constructioin approvals this 
month. 

Prior to groUDdbreakina' in 
March of tbIa year, finalized 
plans must be presented to the 
regional Coastal Commission 
and to the local Public Works 
Board. 

Third College Provost Joseph 
Watson called these structural 
reviews "the last technicali-
ties." He anticipates full 
acceptance for the proposals to 
be submitted by Campus 
Architect Charles Powers. 

Scheduled to open in 1979, the 
Third campus will be com-
pleted with an additional 30,000 
square feet. The new complex, 
west of existing Unit I, will 
consist of three buildings. 

These structures will house 
the Provost's Office including 
the college dean, academic 

advisors, and counselors. 
Space will be provided for 
academic units including 60 
faculty members in economics, 
political science, urban" rural 
studies, literature and third 
world studies. 

The completed project will 
run just under $4 million . 
Watson indicated that "present 
plans and estimated costs will 
come well within budget."

recommended four of the 
candidates to McElroy, who 
made the final decision. 
Armitage was the only candi-
date recommended with near 
unanimous support (Triton 
Times, Nov. 30, 1977) . 

Armitage also received an 
"excellent" rating from the 
student group which met with 
him, although the Graduate 
Student Council, in a letter to 
McElroy, David Bell , said 
candidate who was not recom-
mended by the search commit-
tee, as the best candidate. 

During last week's phone 
interview, Armitage declined 
to comment on any changes in 
student affairs policy he may 
be contemplating.

Assistant Vice-chancellor for 
Academ'ic Services, Harold 
Temmer, refused to accept the 
"validity" of the trust, and also 
has turned down the offer of the 
students to pay that part of 
their fees not involved with 
abortions . As a result, the 
enrollment of Erzinger, Patton 
and Rhomberg was cancelled, 
and they have been denied 
registration material for the

Expensive cars 
An investigation by the 

Triton Times of AS business 
records showed that Drapeau 
had on two occasions rented 
expensive cars - a Pontiac 
Firebird and a Monte Carlo -
for use as cransportation to and 
from UC meetings in San

saying that "the severe

Namias' forecast also called 
for heavier than normal 
snows and rains at higher 
elevations in the state and 
northward to the Canadian

Funds for Third College did 
not materialize in the final state 
budget until last year. Con-
struction money represents the 
culmination of a lengthy three 
year controversy. In battles 
which centered around declin-
ing UC enrollment and tbe 
Governor's no growth policy, 
requests were twice denied by 
the state legislature.

They were successful in 
convincing both the Governor

programatic need existed to

Sindler said he expects the 
Finance Committee to make a 
" two or three-week" investi-
gation, focusing on Drapeau's 
rental of the cars, the type of 
cars he rented, and the need for. 
a car in the first place. 

In cities like San Francisco 
a nd Berkeley , with their 
extensive mass transit sys-
tems, it may not be necessary 
for AS officers to rent cars at 
all . Sindler said. 

No censuring 
Before the council decided to 

refer the charges to the 
Fi nance Committee, the 
members were . asked if they 

provide housing for 665 Third 
College students by fall of 1979. 
Currently more than 400 Third 
College students live at UCSD, 
only 235 of which are able to 
obtai n s pace on their own 
campus. 

Watson hopeful 
Watson believes that " this 

study indicates that we should 
be able to build 350 spaces for 
Third College .. .I am hopeful 
that a decision can be made 
within the next few months in 
sufficient time to open housing 
facilities along with Unit II in 
1979." 

The ultimate decision to build 
more campus apartment space 
rests with the Chancellor , 
Increased rates to students 
must be weighed against 
projected off campus costs and 
an assessment of future

Armitage also said he doesn 't 
" expect to find a great deal of 
difference between Ohio State 
and UCSD. A major factor in 
my decision to come to UCSD is 
that it is still a challenging 
place. Ohio State is over 100 
years old, while UCSD is only 
15. 

;'I'd prefer to wait until I've 
had the time to listen to the 
ideas of faculty , students and 
staff before confirmi ng a 
direction," he said. 

" I'd like to work with the 
people at UCSD to build 
traditions that relate to the 
unique culture of the campus. 
For example, I'd like to see a 
strengthening of the cluster 
college system."

Tom Tribble, Senior

made prior to the wet season 

- because' 'I got tired of

explained, however, that the

major repairs because they 
do not want to compete with

Making your hair healthy Is our way of making your hair 
beautiful. We combine professional direction, dedicated at-
tention and effective products to achieve remarkable results. 

During the past several years the simple "PH Story" has been told over 
and over . Besides preserving nature's Acid Mantle of 4.5-5.5 ph, 
shampoo must contain NUCLEOPROTEINS DNA and RNA. These 
essential building blocks in the polypeptide chain repair damaged protein 
in the same ratio from which it is naturally depleted from the hair!! A full 
complement of amino acids, vitamins, minerals, enzymes and coen-
zymes hydrolized to the correct siZe and weight penetrate the hair shaft 
and are utilized by the NUCLEOPROTEINS to reconstruct hair damage.

repelled in maintaining proper protective balance.

dditional health care 
vailable under proposal 

In addition to access to care at the Student Health Center, all 
students registering at UCSD this fall and paying full 
registration fees are automatically covered under a limited 
supplemental insurance plan for medically necessary health 
care that cannot be provided at the Student Health Center. 
Coverage is provided (or accidental injury care, special 
laboratory tests and x-rays, consultations with medical 
specialists when referred by the Student Health Service, and 
surgery. 

If you need tc) be hospitalized, the insurance program will pay 
up to $1,500 in hospital benerits. While $1,500 may seem like a 
lot, it is not a great deal at today's soaring hospital costs. The 
campus has therefore made an additional OiKional insurance 
plan available to regil"tered students. This doubles the hospital 
benefits you may receive up to $3,000 and also provides a major 
medical expense plan that pays 80 percent of additional covered 
expenses up to $2,000 after you have paid the first $100 of bills 
and 100 percent of aU adtiitional covered expenses up to $25,000. 
The premium for this additional protection is very low at $5 per 
quarter. 

To ,et this addtlonal insurance you must apply for it during 
the open insurance enrollment period at the beginning of each 
quarter. Application forms and more ec.mplete explanations of 
benefits are available at the StudeAt Health Center on the 
Matthews campus. If you are alrea~".ell covered under an 
insurance policy from home, you prob Iy won't need this extra 
protection. And if you are eligible ror niversity of California 
financial aSSistance, you might qwWi UlIt! ~~al 
insurance provided ror you as part of your financial aid 
package. (Check your offer of Financial Aid letter or talk to 
your college section in the Financial Aid Office to nmt out.)

Notice to students on their privacy rights 
In late 1974 (revised June, 

1976) , Congress enacted the · 
Family Educational Rights and 
Privacy Act. Specifically, this 
statute governs (1) access to 
records maintained by our 
educational institutions; (2) the 
release of such records and (3) 
procedures for students to 
amend their individual records, 
request a hearing and/or file 
complaints with the Department 
of Health , Education and 
Welfare regarding alleged 
viola tions of the rights accorded 
them by the Federal Act. 

Edu -:! ~tio nal institutions

office is maintained . These 
records are held for five years 
after the last date of attendance 
at which time they are purled. 

Separately from this folder, 
the Regi trar's Office maintains 
the original and official copy of 

U D ac demic record

Dear Fans, Friends, and Fellow Koala 
, sympathizers: 

After, 10 these many weeks of sun-· 
worshipping 
Downunder , I 
have returned to 
this mecca of 
knowledge to 
share the Wis-
dom of the Eu-
calyptus . At last 
an answer to 
your questions : 

Q. As a follower of major evenlS oa 
campus, I would Uke &0 know wbat 
happened &0 tbe follow-up activities &0 
las' Spring's "big event," die Revelle 
Conoealion. Afler all I wouldD" wan' 
their obmutesceace to bave "sur-
culose" side-effeclS. 

A. Rumor has it that Transcnpts are 
being made of all speeches and panel 
discussions with hopes of transmogri-
fying (how do you like that word?) said 
transcripts into a book. Little else is 
known due to a peculiar lack of 
communication on the part of the 
Provost' s office at Revelle and the 
students . A student follow -up 
committee does exist and any 
suggestions should be addressed to 
Harvey Rabbit care of ext. 9335. 

Q. As a follower of Doonesbury I still 
don't kDOW how &0 &ell &be difference 
between crusbed Ice and a cold band 
when you are on a dale at &be movies 
and you go for &be o&ber's band. 

- Dazed and Confused 
A. Dear D and C, 

Aside from using one's eyes a tab or 
acid might do the trick. But in all 
seriousness wait till the ice melts; 
eliminate one of the variables. 

Q. Beinl new to &be area, wbere can I 
find a ,ood beaUh food store 
(preferably one that Is fairly priced). 

-Preserve Me 

A. According to the local handbook on 
body maintainance, Suture Seu, San 
Diego is a treasure when it comes to 
good health food stores. Depending 
upon personal needs New Seed in 
Pacific Beach '(on Garnet near 
Mission Blvd.) is excellent as is JB's 
on Clairemont Mesa Blvd. (near 
Genessee) . The Frazier Farms health 
foods stores have fresh breads several 
times a week and can be found in PB 
and La Jolla . Then there is also the 
Windansea in La Jolla (on La Jolla 
Blvd. near Nautilus) which makes 
fresh sandwiches and other tasty 
items . Each place has their own 
unique atmosphere and style and it is 
urged that you try them all . For a real 
change there is a co-<>p somewhere in 
Del Mar that specializes soley in 
health products . F inally the last 
extreme is the supermarket- like 
Windmill Farms in Del Mar. Most, if 
not all of these places , are accesible by 
bus with minimum of hassle. 

Q. What does tile V.T. stand for in 
D.V.T. Bear? 
A. Van Twisk. As in DQIlald Van Twisk 
Bear , chair of the .i!:conomlcs

For UCSD senior Bolton 
Colburn, who won themen's title 
at t h e Am eri c a n Surfing 
Associa ti on's All -Am er ican 
Natio na l Champion ships in 
Huntington Beach on December 
30, it was much m<re than the 
water. By winning the champ-
ionship, Colburn can lay claim to 
being the top male surfEr in the 
nati on and canpete in the W (J"ld ' 
Surfing Championships in Brazil 
this June. Billy Stern, also fran 
UCSD, took third place in the 
c<mpetition, which pitted the 
American Surfing Association's 
(ASA) West Coast best against 
the top surfErS fr<m the East and 
Hawaii.

Although not a consistent 
winnEr in dual meets (Colburn 
also c<mpetes -f(J" the Triton's 
powerful interc ollegiate surf 
team). he wasn't surIrised to 
have won the ASA All-American 
meet. " I didn't have to woo-y (in 
the National Championships)

on m y own." Two to three hour 
workou ts a t s unri se da il y 

, C<mbined with the right mental 
frame earned the title . 

Surfing has been thought to be 
a non-com petitive s p ort, but 
Colburn points out that that 
opinion c ouldn ' t be mo re 
incorrect. " It's one of the most 
competitive (sports) I've ever 
been in. Even in practice or 
surfing for fun , you compete 
against the guy paddling next to 
you." This type of attitude has 
undoubtedly motivated Col-
burn to atta in his success. 

The ASAmeet 

At Huntington Beach, Colburn 
says his main c <mpetition came 
fran Mark Wil<lnan, who is a 
native of Kallua, Hawaii - h<me 
of s<me of the best surfing spots 
in the w<rld. 

To qualify for the ASA 
National meet, Colburn finished 
in the top 15 among Calif.:rnia' s 
coUegiate surfers and then won 
the West Coast CoUegiate meet 
in Oceanside on December 4. On 
that same day, he placed high in 
the all-ASA West Coast Champ-

ionships, thus placing him in the 
Na ti onal s. For hi s efforts, 
'Colburn was named to the West 
Coast Conference team , the 
West Coast College champion 
and put on the All-American 
squad, along with StErn. 

ExceUed quickly 
Born in Cannel, Colburn was 

raised in a h<me overlooking a 
ca nyon . He observed " the 
constant rapport with nature 
enticed me to find sanething 
clean to do." When his family 
moved to Clairernont, Colburn, 
then 11 years old, " needed an 
outlet with nature," so he took 
up surfing. " I excelled immed-
iately ," he remembers , and 
paling around with a surfing 
(J"owd at Madison High School 
helped Colburn's s urfing 
bec<me bettEl' .. . and bettEr ... and 
bettEr. 

Clark Quinn, UCSD's intEr-
collegiate surfing coach, rates 
Colburn, now 22, as "the most 
tale.nted at school and one of the 
bettEr surfErS I've evEr see&. 
He's quite an amazing surfEr." 
Unaware that Colburn won the 

ASA Nationals, Quinn (who had 
been skiing in Idaho during the 
quartEr Ireak) was not shoCked 
at the news. " I knew he had the 
potential . But, I am amazed a nd 
pleased that (Billy) StErn was 
third. " 

In June, Colburn and Stern, 
along with ten othEr men and 
twelve women , led by Sue 
Collins of Huntington Beach, 
will travel to Brazil f oc the W <rid 
Championships . Colburn is 
confident he will eithEr place 
high (J" win the meet. " ThEre 
won 't be any c<inpetition unless 
Australia sends a team. The 
United States is the top surfing 
nation." 

Colburn , an art history 
criticism mcijor at Muir , will 
graduate this June and then 
"turn 11'0 and travel . I won't 
make much money but I'll get to I::> 
travel. " It's a good bet that 
Bolton Colburn , the United 
States top amatua- male surfer 
who has never been outside of 
Calif<rnia, will be on top of the 
w<rld c<me June .

Dancing overcomes 
plot deficiencies 
in "Turning Point" 

by.MBueley 
A west treat fer the baUeto-

mane or tbe Maclainmnane, 
Herbert ROIl' "The 1'1rnln1 
Point," st.-rinC Anne Bancroft 
and Sb8iey Maclaine, makes 
only a half-toed .estlft towards 
reaJillD and entenaUment en 
maue. It is a 8m fer the ballet 
elite. I know this because aD tbe 
esoterica of tbe movie was 
explained tome befcrehand by a 
fCl1ller student of the AmfriC8n 
Ballet Tbeatre, the model fer the 
film 's American Ballet COOl-
pany, ' because I have seen 
enough of Shirley Maclaine to 
know that her pericnnance is 
extremely sensitive (but, then, I 
like Shirley Maclaine) and 
because I'm enough of a ballet· 
nut to convince myself that the 
small amount of ballet footage is 
actually a 100d folK' fifths oftbe 
fUn. 

If, however, I could not 
stonach Maclaine, did not lave 
ballet and saw nothing in 
Barysbnikov to idolize, then 
"The TlI'Ding Point'''s sappy, 
outdated and loose ended plot 
might have ended up tlrlling me 
off altogether. It's in the scenes 
behind the scenes where the 
movie falls apart: the sweat, the 

baBet classes, the intrilUes -
that's an real, but the plot is so 
incredibly left footed. 

Tbe ttrniOl pmnt bas to do 
witb tbe choice between 
sparkly, but lonely, career i. 
dance, (X' a Ufe of bitterness in 
S(Jlle sublrban bone, S(Jtle-
where, U.S.A. These lrIumatic 
polar solutions to the familiar 
h(Jlle VEJ'SUS career a'isis are 
relieved by the dubious hin(J' of 
the same old wisea-acks about 
b(Jllosexuality we've aD heard a 
hundred times before , and 
topped off by a scene of harpy-
like screeching and clawing 
between the two leading 
charactEJ'S, Drma and Deedee, 

In suppm1ing roles, dancers 
Leslie Browne and Mikha l 
Baryshnikav do a-edit to the 
actinl professi on by no t 
overacting, while at the same 
WIle displaying theirmagnificen 
dance technique to the fuDe 

The best dancers in America, 
the greatest ballets and thf 
cunning, selective art 0 
cinematography combine to 
a-eate a pericnnance of such 
rare beauty that even the sickly 
plot, which was inspired, most 
likely, by "As Tbe World 
TtrIls, II ca~ot dminish it.
