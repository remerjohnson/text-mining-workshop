Student services in 
midst of reshuffling 

BY JEFFREY LEE 
A sociate New Editor 

Student services. There 
are 0 many of them now that 
it is hard to remember where 
orne of them are located . 

But things are going to get 
more confusing in the future 
when the Student Center 
starts to re huffle their 
offices. 

reorganization and renaming 
of the Draft Registration 
Center, Housing, Religious 
and Legal Services into one 
group to be called Campus 
Related Services. 

The UEO will also be under 
a new blanket organization to 
be named Central Campus 
Programming, headed by 
Roland Buck, formerly in 
charge of the Student Center. 

"We were lead to believe 
that our office will run as is 
- with no loss of personnel," 
says Lynne Peterson of the 
UEO about the move. 

Uncle Sam thanks you 

Two kinds of changes will 
be made by the on-campus 
services. The first will be the 
moving of the Career 
Planning and Placement 
office to the basement of the 
Humanities Library Build-
ing, where the graduat~ 
literature students used to 
be. Then, Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affair Richard 
Armitage will move into the 
old offices that Career 
Planning and Placement had 
in Building "B" of the 
Student Center. Confusing? 
That's not all. 

"We work so closely with 
the Associated Students 
(office) that it made sense to 
have everybody in the same 
area," Peterson says. The 
UEO i currently located in 
the lower floor of Building 
"B" in the Student Center. 

Roland Buck is now the 
"Assistant to the Vice 
Chancellor - what they've 
done is created a new division 
under Armitage, like (Nick) 
Aguilar ," Peterson says. 
Buck will be retitled as the 
Dean of Central Campus 
Programming when the 
reorganization is completed 
sometime in November. 

When 93 percent of 18- and 
19-year old American men 
went to their mailboxes last 
week, they got an early 
Christmas present from 
Uncle Sam_ 

The fact that many of 
these men would have been 
just a happy without the 
gift didn't stop the Selective 

General 
store 
opens 

BY S. GOLDSTICK 
With a new school year 

comes new faces, new 
knowledge and the same 
old difficulties with money 
and classes_ 

There is also one other 
new thing on campus this 
year, a new window in the 
Student Center. It belongs 
to The General Store, a 
place which might ease 
some of those difficulties. 

It has most .of the 
practical necessities that 
school and dorm living 
require, ranging from 
pens, paper and calcula-
tors to tape recorders, 
toaster ovens and even 
used blue jeans. Prices on 
most items are 10 to 15 
percent below their 
suggested retail price_ 

The General Store 
began with the help of 
individual donations and 
the Student Center, and is 
run by students as a 
cooperative. The store is 
" more to serve the student 
than to make a profit ," 
says Bob Corlew, one of 
the tudents responsible 
for getting the tore off the 
ground. 

" One of our main 
purposes is to expand the 
base of the c~operative 
movement," Corlew says, 
"and part of our ideal i to 
keep prices rea onable." 

But one of the problem 
in opening up a mall tore 
like thi one, ay Corlew,

mailing out millions of 
computer-prepared draft 
registration acknowledg-
ment forms. 

John Doe down the street 
suddenly became 61 -
0050355-6 on SSS Form 3A, 
but Bernard Rostker, 
Selective Service director, 

tried to pre erve at lea t a 
tidbit of sensitivity in his 
acknowledgment letter by 
cheerfully cIo ing: "Thank 
you again for registering 
with the Selective Service 
System."

At the same time the 
University Events Office will 
move into Armitage's 
quarters in the student 
center and Legal Services 
will make the UEO space 
downstairs in Building "B" 
its own. 

The second phase of 
transition will be the

Summer not quiet for scientists 
Although students vacated 

UCSD's lecture halls and 
dorms this summer, scien-
tists here kept bu y in their 
labs. 

New in titutes were 
formed, insights to learning 
disabilities found and 
expeditions embarked upon, 
just to list a few of the 
ummer activities.

summary of the ummer

"I don't care if they give 
him (Buck) a title or shuffle 
us around, just as long as it 
doesn't interfere with our 
job," Peterson says. 

Nick A~uilar of Legal 
Services WIll be the head of 
the soon-to-be-formed 
Campus Related Services. 
The groups of campus 
organizations will be able to 
coordinate what they offer to 
students and will better 
handle the students' needs. 

Aguilar nearly lost his job 
as head of Legal Services for 
this year because of a 
Registration Fee Committee 
vote last quarter to replace 
Legal Services with a legal 
clinic with students from the 
University of San Diego. 

The Reg Fee Commjttee 
later reversed its decision, 
and Aguilar will soon have 
even more responsibility in 
hi new post. 

Peterson IS "concerned" 
about the move, aying, ''I'm 
not sure where we're headed , 
but just let u do our jobs."

story. 

BY KATHY HUFFER 
It was growing warm 

outside though the air would 
turn ev'e.n more sultry in the 
weeks to come. The piercing 
laUlhter of children and the 
rattle of city·torn cars 
blended in with sounds of 
honking. music and barking 

~he was stiD inside the 
house despite the rising 
temperature of late 
afternoon. Her mind ~as 
preoccupied. Not WIth 
anythina terribly importan~, 
but her head seemed a bIt 
sharper today. her thouahts a 
little clearer. Yet she was 
almost placid. caught 
between the ties of two 
worlds. Roc:Idnaslowly in her 
chair she closed her eyes. a baH~mile curving her lips. 
Her eyebrows twitched, and a 
.. eecaped as she drifted 
t.ck deeper and deeper .... 

BIde ihe went, before her 
move to the city, back before 
her first daUlhter moved out, 
beyond the time of young 
instability. She. returned 
home. As the qUiet summer 
breeze pulled on the ends of 
her dress she smelled the 
familiar North Carolina air. 
It was pungent, warm, 
protective. She was home 

I lIPiD. where the pains of the 
past disappeared behind 
fantasy memories. 

She had grown up here, 
part of a sprawling family 
where grand and great· 
grandparents had bu}1t the 
additions to her history. 
North Carolina, where the 
sounds of children and 
aickets blended with the 
ringing of crickets. It's not 
here, ·too, she thought 
languidly. But somehow it 
was easier to keep comfor· 
table. And at least she felt no 
angler. 

Yes, she loved it all, the 
people, noises, odors. Had she 
beeit unhappy as a child? 
Funny. she couldn't quite 
remember. But no matter, for 
she was back where she could 
better understand the 
teaaings of mortality, and the 

tuggings of loneliness. A 
wave of relief passed 
through her, and she shud· 
dered happily. a few. drops 
of liquid steamed thmly 
down her spent cheecks. 
Her head nodded gently. 

Her attention was drawn 
to the window, and she 
noticed for the first time that 
darkness was showing signs 
of its regular return. She 
turned her head, first to the 
right, and then slowly around 
to the other side, and the fog 
began to lift. 

Carefully she pulled 
herself upright and blinked. 
A peculiar pang of excitement 
tickled her chest. Squirming 
a bit, she stepped forward 
toward the front door. The 
treeze was too inviting to 
struggle against, and she 
pushed her way through to 
the front porch. It would be 
nice to get a short walk into 
her unwilling limbs, she 
thought. . 

No one paid her attentlon 
when she descended the front 
steps. It was nice to be alone, 
she thought absently. Noone 
gripped her elbow or pushed 
her along. And after all, 
couldn't she walk by herself 
after 98 years? She chuckled 
softly as she thought bac.:k. 
Back, back she went agalO, 
and she hardly noticed the 
cars that stopped as she 
a"06Sed the first intersection. 
Her pace quickened. 

She had lived a long life; 
anyone could attest to that. 
Hadn't she sacrificed much 
over the years? Nothing could 
have been more difficult, she 
recalled, than hermoveto.the 
city. Away from her ties, 
from her heritage. She 
reflected on the crowded 
house she had tended for so 
many years without commit· 
ment. And then she realized 

that she did not care to 
return; no, she had no 
intention of returning. 
Quietly, she whispered to 
herself: home. 

She walked for a couple of 
hours, and still the sun had 
not quite blanketed the city. 
Her step had livened, and 
from some forgotten 
reservoir young energy eased 
the pangs of age. She had 
crossed countless intersec· 
tions, had manuevered past 
hundreds of cars, had turned 
many corners. The city was 
bigger than she had thought. 
But she wasn't discouraged. 
Somewhere not far a way was 
the river. Once she crossed it, 

th~ lights would no longer 
stmg her eyes. 

On she walked, past the 
pompous marbled walls, 
then past the neon bli~king 
signs. The street hghts 
flashed on, and dusk forced 
her old eyes to squint. I'd 
better hurry. she thought. 
Excited, she quickened her 
step' even more. The wide 
butldings gave way to 
crowded, small shops filled 
with well·dressed people who ' 
,'osUed by her in their 
aughing hurry. North 

Carolina was a long walk 
away, she thought with a 
frown. 

At first she didn't notice 
the car idling behind,her. ~he 
car's red light wasn ton hke 
it always was in her 
neighborhood. But they wer:e 
climbing out oft he car, and,lf 
she wasn't mistaken, they 

we~ looking in her direction. 
She 'stood still and waited as 
t hey approached . 

With gentle politeness, one 
of the officers asked her 
where she was walking. The 
question took her aback. She 
could not answer. The other 
officer stepped forward. 
Placing a hand on her 
shoulder, he said her name 
and asked again where .she 
was going. Though surpnsed 
that they knew her name, she 
knew she had not hing to fear. 
After all. hadn't they calmed 
down her neighborhood just 
last week? True. they hod 
bothered one of the children 
unnecessarily, but they just 
didn't know any better -
they just didn't understand 
the neighborhood. 

North Carolina, she 
croaked, squaring her 
stooped shoulders. ~he 
officers exchanged knoWing 

' glances, and one of them

Iranian oil center target 
of heavy military attack 

Iraqi ground and air forces 
struck into Iran along a broad 
front yesterday. zeroing in on 
the Iranian oil center of 
Abadan, as the conflict 
between the two Persian 
Gulf military powers erupted 
into all·out war. Iran's US· 
made warplanes hit back 
with punishing raids on Iraqi 
cities and oil targets. 

The night sky over 
Baghdad was alight with 
anti·aircraft fire and Iranian 
bombs "falling all over the 
place," a witness reported. 

Four unidentified Amer· 
icans were reported killed in 
Iranian bombing raids on the 
petrochemical complex near 
Basra , Iraq. The war had an 
immediate effect on the 52 
American hostages in Iran -
the Iranian Parliament 
decided to "freeze" its 
consideration of their fate, 
and their mili tant captors 
said some were again being 
moved about inside Iran. 

The UN Security Coun.cil 
scheduled urgent conSulta· 
tions on the conflict. 

Iraq claimed its jets set the 
giant Abadan refinery ablaze, 
destroying it, and its armor· 

led ground forces captured 
the major Iranian border 
town of Qasre-Shirin. 300 
miles to the north. 

The Iraqi invaders also 
surrounded the city of 
Abadan and the port city of 
Khorramshahr, across the 
disputed Shatt al ·Arab 
waterway separating the two 
nations. Iraq government 
communigues said. They' 
cal led it a ' victorious march ' 
into Iran . 

Initial Tehran broadcasts 
claimed Iranian forces 
repulsed the Iraqis, but later 
reports confirmed the 
Abadan complex had come 
under attack. 

The Baghdad government 
said 47 people were killed and 
116 wounded when wave 
after wave of Iranian jets 
bombed the Iraqi capital and 
other cities, air bases and oil 
installations in Iraq. Iran 
issued no casualty reports 
from the attacks on its sideof 
the border. 

The Iraqi command 
claimed 67 Iranian warplanes 
were shot down, but the 
Iranians conceded the loss of 
only two.

Warhead is 
relocated 

UTILE ~OCK. Ark. -
The nine·megaton nuclear 
warhead that was ejected 
from a missile silo during an 
explosion last week will be 
taken to agovernment·owned 
weapons assembly plant in 
Texas for disassembly or 
analysis, a federal official 
says. 

The warhead apparently 
was removed from the area of 
the underground Titan II 
missile silo near Damascus 
on Monday and taken to 
Little Rock Air Force Base. 
The New York Times 
yester day quoted an 
unidentified Defense Depart· 
ment official as saying the 
warhead was slightly dented, 
but had not leaked radiation. 

An explosion on Friday at 
the silo which followed a fuel 
leak, killed one serviceman 
and injured 21 others. 
Suit filed on 
Rely tampons 

SAN FRANCISCO - A 
federal c1ass·action suit, 
described as the first of its 

kind, was filed yesterday 
against Proctor & Gamble 
Co. - the makers of the 
controversial Rely tampon 
which has been linked by 
government studies to toxic 
shock syndrome. 

The multimillion·dollar 
suit filed in US District Court 
claims Rely is unsafe and 
that all women who use it 
face " lacerations and toxic 
reactions." Rely was taken 
off the market on Monday. 

The action. filed by 
attorney David Gold on 
behalf of all women, was 
brought by Carol A. 
Thompson of Union City and 
Barbara Lee of Woodland . 
Both the California women 
are in their early 308. 

The suit did not put a 
specific dollar figure on the 
amount of damages sought. 

Cancer genes

NEW YORK - In a

to spot some forms of the

more effective treatment .

medical researchers report. 
Using the technique, 

doctors can verify a 
borderline diagnosis of a 
white blood cancer known as 
chronic granUlocytic leuke-
mia - and predict when the 
virulent phase of the disease 
will appear. 

The "fingerprint" techno-
logy developed 10 years ago 
but only now coming into 
routine clinical use, also can 
alert doctors to patients who 
have undergone surgery for 
bladder cancer but face a 
recurrence, the researchers 
say. 

LA recession 
prices down 

LOS ANGELES - As a 
state report shOwed the 
worst of the recession has 
passed, the US Department 
of Labor said yesterday that 
consumer prices in Los 
Angeles and Orange counties 
declined in August for the 
second straight month. 

The 0.6 percent drop in the 
two-county Consumer Price 
Index, due mainly to lower 
home mortgage rates, bucked 
a national increase of 0.7 
percent. Both figures were 
the same for the second 
consecutive month.

you may have-read about, but hoots 
like seagulls massing over a loaded 
barge. 

When the bus driver unlocks the 
door she strong-arms Mr. Shy in front 
of h~r and onto the firs t s tep. "Shit," 
he says throwing a dime under the 
bus and' diving after it. But it's a lost 
cause for when he climbs on board, 
she ~inks and smirks at him, 
exclaiming to her girlfriend that i,t's 
the guy they were talking to earher 
and doesn't she recognize him. And by 
the time she transfers to the 43 she 
has his name and address. "I wish 
they had plugs on the bus so I could 
bring my electric curlers ," she says, 
climbing down. 

The next connection doesn't come 
for half an hour. Karen remembers

A joint venture of 

anthropologists and oceano-
graphers with sailins- ships 
and satellites is tracmg the 
root s of the Polynes ian 
culture while providing 
valuable data for global 
weather prediction s tudies. 

Steering by the stars 
without sextant or compass 
and using ancient Polynesian 
sailing arts, Hawaiian 
Charles Nainoa Thompson 
and a crew of 13 recently 
completed the first voyage 
that simulated the migration 
of natives from Tahiti to the 
Hawaiian Islands. 

Their craft, a replica of 
ships used by ancient 
Polynesians, traveled alone 
for the more than 2,500-nau-
tical-mile journey. The craft, 
a 6O-ft, double-hulled sailing 
canoe , was tracked by 
satellites via an oceano-
graphic location system 
developed at Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography. 
The satellite "watch" 
provided safety without

from the adventurous 
journey. 

According to Dr. William 
C. Patzert and Gerard J. 
McNally, coheads of the 
Scripps buoy program, "The 
nearly two-month -long 
expedition yielded valuable 
engineering information and 
was a test of the satellite 
buoy system, while providing 
precise tracking of the

to long periods of windward 
sailing. 

"The ancient Polynesians 
were truly great seafarers, 
both in skill and daring, Slfl\:e 
the 2,500-nautical-mile 
stretch from Tahiti to Hawaii 
is among the most difficult 
and longest journeys in the 
tropical Pacific," Patzert 
says. 

During the expedition, the 
Hawaiian navigator made a 
voice recording, lotm,ing each 
decision and giving his 
jud~ment regarding the 
ship s location. This will be 
compared with the satellite-
determined locations -
giving a scientific measure of 
the accuracy of the ancient 
ways. 

The transmitter used on 
board Hok"k'Q - Hawaiiari 
for "star of joy" - is now 
back at Scripps. Patzert and 
McNally, designers of the 
buoy system, are comparing 
the data from the Holtuk'Q 
transmitter with those from 
their buoys.

The system is used for 
satellite-tracking of buoys as 
part of a global weather 
experiment, funded primar-
ily by the National Science 
Foundation. 

This joining of the most 
ancient seafaring techniques 
and modern satellite 
technology was an opportu-
nity for both anthropologists 
and oceanographers to gain 

"The route sailed with the 
dou ble- hulled canoe is 
impressive," Patzert says, 
" especially when you 
consider the varied sailing 
condi tions ." Pa tzert has 
sailed those waters in a small 
craft, and, through his 
research on air and sea 
conditions in the area, he has 
deployed more than 60 buoys 
over the past 18 months, 
which have been transmit-
ting data via a satellite 
network to his laboratory at 
Scripps. 

"Our buoys have detected 
westward-moving whirlpool-
like eddies, some several 
hundred miles in diameter, 
and the prevailing wind 
conditions are far from 
accomodating, ranging from 

McNally says, "Since the 
Hokuk 'Q was traveling in the 
same area as our deployment 
of buoys for the weather 
experiment, we were able to 
use it as a check against our 
system. We are very pleased 
with the way our data was 
confirmed. In fact, based on

All Atnerican player 

Coach to rearrange offense to fill gap 
BY SCOTT ALLISON 

Senior Stalf Writer 
The UCSD women 's 

volleyball team was shocked 
Monday when their All · 
American middle blocker, 
Elaine Bergman, announced 
that she is leaving the team. 

Bergman, a vital force in 
the Triton offense for more 
than two years, cited a heavy 
work load and familial 
obligations as reasons for her 
decision. 

"We'll miss her a ton," said 
volleyball coach Doug 
Dannevik. "She was a very 
valuable offensive force and a 
stable influence on the 
team." 

Bergman may have been 
the finest female athlete ever 
to rompete at UCSD. She 

carried the spikers to a 
fourth· place fini sh in the na· 
tional championships last 
year, and it earned her the 
most coveted award this 
school offers - UCSD Ath· 
lete of the Year.

star team which has many 
UCSD players on it, and the 
Tukapa Colts from New 
Zealand. The match gets 
underway at 1 p m.

1975. 

Tickets for the match are 
available at the University 
Events box office or from 
any member of the rugby 
team. 

Rugby at UCSD is also

Some guys have all the 
luck in the world. And then, 
there are others like "Lucky 
Bird" Cameron, who's spent 
the last 26 months of his life 
being pursued by the police. 
During a woodland escape, he 
inadvertently runs into a 
filming crew, an incident 
that results in the drowning 
death of a stuntman. 

Cameron's final image of 
the tragedy is of the director, 
Eli Cross, who looks at him 
from a hovering helicopter 
with a baleful eye. It was not 
to be their last meeting, as 
the two confront one another 
on a La 10lla Shores beach 
shooting. Here, Eli proposes 
an unusual deal: stay on the 
film as a replacement in 
exchange for shelterfrom the 
police. Cameron consents to 
the arrangement, but before

decision. For the next three

'Stunt Man' fin s a 
place in our sun 
Two leads talk about stunts 
and film's rough start 

BY LYNETTE TOM 
Auoewte Art. Editor 

Only a few wispy clouds 
marred the otherwise clear blue 
San Diego sky. 

It was the first sunny day in 
two weeks... the perfect 
weather to accent a recent 
press luncheon for actors Steve 
Railsback and Barbara Hershey 
at the Hotel del Coronado. 

Nearly three years have 
passed since they first set foot 
on the premises. Then, the 
Victorian resort served as one of 
the city's locations for the 
principal photography of the 
newly released film, The Stunt 
Man. Now, as the two were 
reunited at the Winsor Room to 
discuss their roles in the picture 
before local journalists, the 
memories returned with a usual 
rush. 

For Steve Railsback, the red 
tiled roofs and white latticed 
towers of the hotel are of 
particular significance. It was 
there that he. as Cameron, 
climbed, dove, leapt, and 
scrambled in a number of stunts 
that would put the dainty 
cavortings of Santa's perennial 
reindeer to utter shame. 

"1 did 75 to 80 percent of the 
stunts in the film," he said. "1 
wanted to do them, because it 
pve me a chance to get more 
mto my character." 

The stuntwork also provided 
an opportunity to test for 
acrophobia. a fear that 
Railsback wasn't always 
prepared to suppress, especially 
when he and co-star Peter 
O'Toole had to ride around in a 
director's crane with only a thin 

leather strap tied across their 
laps as a safety device. 

"When we reached the tower, 
it was as if we were five miles 
up," recalled Railsback. "We 
could see the whole world. You 
never saw two actors who said 
their lines faster. And this was, 
like, one or two in the mornin~." 

Barbara Hershey's reminls, 
cences of the stint as Nina 
Franklin aren't as dangerous, 
but just as colorful. 

"My last impression of this 
hotel was seeing a big dead fish 
lying in the middle of the 
lobby," she quipped. "n was a 
scene that was later cut out of 
the film." 

One scene which didn't find 
itself at the bottom of the 
editing bin wac; a dramactic 
confrontation between Nina 
and Cameron that turns into. 
paint fight. Hershey regards it 
as her favorite. 

"There were a lot of 
wonderful moments in the 
film," she says. "You always 
hope for a few scenes where 
something clicks. When I read 
the paint· throwing scene, 1 
screamed. But then, it was such 
a wonderful script. Every scene 
had meaning and whimsy, and 
yet, it built up the plot. It's 
amazing how much it reflects a 
lot of attitudes about film." 

The notion that a picture has 
to fit in a specific cat~ry to 
bring in box office profits was 
explored extensively in real life 
by director Richard R'ush, who 
went from one studio to another

Myrick and the 
Figures: free Sunday 

Gary Myrick and the Figures will make their 
second campus appearance in four months Sunday 
night 8:00 at Walk's Place, the student center pub. 

The show is free. 
Myrick played on the last day of classes, as the 

opening act for Southside Johnny and the Asbury 
Jukes. 

Myrick received an enthusiastic reception and 
has just released his first album. That album 
carries the same name as the band. 

Myrick is a Texan who has been playing in Los 
Angeles clubs since the mid· 70's. He and the 
Figures have caught on at Epic Records after 
playing at the Roxy Thater, the first group without 
a recording contract to play there since the advent 
of New Wave. 

The music is all power, with traces of pop and 
psychedelic influences. Myrick is the lead guitar 
and handles almost all the vocals. 

During their performance in the UCSD gym, the 
group kept a small television set tuned to the local 
news atop a piano downstage right. Myrick and the 
band also went in for t he grease look, but, if current 
publicity photos are any indication, they have 
cleaned up their act .

The Otto Preminger image 

« a film director - the roly· 
poly figure, the beret and 
ridmg crop, the yes man at 
his feet - pales quickly 
under the thin stature and 
guant features of Eli Cross. 
Played with brilliance by 
Peter O'Toole, he gives the 
character a demanding edge 
that repels and hypnotizes 
his cast and crew. Yet at the 
same time, he draws respect . 
One who respects Cross is 
Cameron, who becomes 

paranoic about the possibility 
that Eli isn't the sane and 
sensible man that everyone 
else seems to think he is 
Steve Railsback's portrayal 
of the police fugitive-turned· 
stuntman is outstanding. 

Barbara Hershey brings 
both beauty and talent to the 
part of Nina Franklin, an 
actress capable of pulling off 
an emotional cemetary scene 
at one moment, and engaging 
in a paint fight on the next.

by a sign t hat read, "C I u b Boom· Boom, Exotic 
Dancing Nitely." As she entered and her eyes 
adjusted to the darkness, she beheld the 
largest man she's ever seen wearin~ a leopard 
skin bikini, juggling battered bowhn¥, pins to 
Spike Jones "Hawaiian Love Song, , which 
poured forth from a crippled juke box in the 
corner of the steamy room. 

A sign above the dancer's head read, 
"Bubba, the Amazing Samoan Wonder," and 
she watched in fascination as the ebony· 
skinned giant's masterful hands caught and 
held momentarily the rising and falling pins. 
Soon he began to add his own fierce moans to 
the frenetic yodeli~of Spike Jones. The sweat 
poured in mighty fivers off his body. She felt 
her own blood pounding in her head, felt the 
sweat break out in her armpits and begin to 
run down the sides of her dress. She stared 
hard at him, and finally forced his gaze to meet 
hers. Thejolt was immediate; he stopped dead, 
and his Pins fell on and around him unheeded. 

He seemed hypnotized as he stllglfered to her 
table. "Who · are you, you goddess," he 
whispered hoarsely. "Will you be mine?" 

"Yes, yes, yes," she groaned. "Take me with 
you to your island paradise, with its seething, 
upthrusting volcanoes, and its wet, rain· 
drenched craters. Take me where the storms 
bring great, purifying buckets of effluvia 
down on the parched and dreary land, to Jrive 
birth to tiny seedling, and bring death to 
unsuspecting people out for a Sunday canoe 
ride." 

He picked her up easily and threw her over 
his shoulder and ran out the club door. Then 
he jogged with her all the way to the hotel. 
She'd always wanted a man who would carry 
her off like that . They'd barely made it to the 
room when they fell on each other, sliding

against each other's salty sea of leaking fluid. 
Finally. their lips locked into a kiss, and it 
seemed like the whole world. their lives. their 
clothes, her duffle bag and his bowling pins 
were being washed away in the mightiest 
river of his w ater· soaked country. Afterwards, 
they held each other and talked of rivers they 
had known and loved . He'd ridden the 
Colorado rapids one summer with a group of 
really fun people and she'd honeymooned at 
Niagara Falls. 

Luna put out her cigarette and stretched . It 
had been one of her best weekend adventures, 
she concluded, as she sucked her own thumb. 
With her free hand she reached into her duffle 
bag and drew out her crumpled list. 
"Samoan." she wrote carefully at the bottom.

Two leads talk about 'SM' 
coatinued from .,.Ie 9 
with a clip of Railsback's daring roof romps, 
only to be turned down. 

"People thought it was a love story, and it IS 
a love story. but it's more than that," 
explained Railsback. "Others thought its was 
a drama, and it is, but it's more than a drama. 
Some though it was suspense, and, so on .. The 
film has 'SO. many levels and it scared the 
studios. They didn't know how to sell It. " 

The Stunt Man was screened five times for 
the Director's Guild and each screening 
concluded with a standing ovation for Rush, a 
reaction that Railsback declares was done 
"out of respect, because the other directors 
realized how difficult it was to make this 
film," Railsback said . But still it had troubles 
finding release. 

As usual, the moviegoers were the ones who 
came to the rescue. Thanks to their 
enthusiastic response at sneak previews held 
in Los Angeles theaters, the film now has a 
distributor, 20th Century·Fox. 

Much of the acclairri has been directed 
towards Railsback's performance of Cameron. 
So strong is viewer identification that it's not 
unusual for someone to approach the actor and 
say that Railsback reminds him of the person 
himself. 

"Cameron represents the audience," stated 
Railsback. "When he gets manipulated, so do 
the people. They know nothing more than he 
does. People look up to him as an Everyman 
character. All of us have gone through what 
he's going through in one wa¥ or another."

Ocean 
slug 

continued from page 16 
This slug is the highest 

organism known to incorpor-
ate features of both plant and 
animal. 

Apart from this scientific 
curiosity, the slug is of 
interest to Scripps scientists 
as a possi ble sou rce of 
natural pharmaceutical or 
herbicidal chemicals. 

The adult slug is 
completely free of natural 
predators, while the juvenile 
form, which does not contain 
the choloroplasts, does have 
predators. 

IStunt 
Man' 

continued from pa&e 12 
The way that The Stunt 

Man intertwines reality with 
illusion until nobody knows 
which is which isn't 
restricted to characters 
alone. Several of the hotel's 
towers were "blown up," 
hence leading one person to 
call manager Scott Anderson 
and express his sympathy 
over the fact that the Hotel 
del Coronado no longer 
existed. 

It's no illusion that the film 
will strengthen the acting 
careers of Railsback and 
Hershey. The former was 
recently seen as Pruitt in the 
TV movie, Fram Here to 
Eternity , but is best known 
for his chilling portrayal of 
Charles Manson in Heller 
Skeller. 

'" could do almost 
anything with Manson and 
did," he said. "He was the 
kind of character where you 
could let yourself go. It was a 
very complex part, and fun in 
the sense that I had no 
limits." 

An excellent example was 
Manson's testimonial 
speech, which caught the 
interest of Rush. After a few 
phone calls, script specula-
tion by Railsback, and ten 
minutes of improvised 
dialogue between the director 
and the actor, Railsback 
received the part. 

"Richard never changed 
his mind," he said. ''I'm glad 
he didn't." 

Hershey's face is most 
recognizable by television 
viewers who . tuned into her 
performance as Karen 
Holmes in the short-lived 
series, From Here to Eternity. 
She remembers the audition 
held at Rush's house as 
"wonderful. " 

"At the same time, , had 
received another movie 
offer," she continued. '" 
phoned Richard and told him 
that if J had a choice, I would 
rather do The Stunt Man. 
Well, Richard called me back 
later and when , answered 
the phone, he asked 'Is Nina 
Franklin in' , thought that 
was really gratifying." 

And what more could an up 
and com ing actor as k for than 
to work alongside such a 
distinguished stage and 
screen star as Peter O'Toole? 

"He's one of a kind," 
declared Railsback. "You 
work with so many people 
and give a lot, but that's what 
acting is all about, the gift of 
giving. It feels good when 
someone looks at you and not 
throu,h you . Peter's a 
1 'f' p-derful actor."
