Sixth College Provost Appointed 

BY KASHI KHORASANI

The University of California Board of Regents approved the second phase of rehabilitation for UCSD’s University 
House on Jan. 19. Construction on the second 
phase is set to begin this April. The Regents 
also chose to officially rename the building 

“Audrey Geisel University House” to honor Mrs. 
Geisel’s continued support of the university and 
her recent $2 million donation to the project. 
     Following UC tradition, every UCSD 
Chancellor has resided at University House, 
which is located approximately one half mile 
west of Muir campus in La Jolla Farms. In 
2004, just before Chancellor Marye Anne Fox 
would have moved in, the seven-acre estate was 

deemed uninhabitable due to structural and 
system deficiencies as well as code compliance 
issues.        According to 
“Officials Plan University House Renovations,” 
published March 7, 2011 in the Guardian, a 
Jan. 28, 2011 environmental impact report from 
UCSD’s physical planning department stated that

A.S. President Alyssa Wing announced 
to A.S. Council Jan. 25 that a final draft of 
the referendum to move UCSD to Division 
I in all sports had been completed, after 
adjusting several inconsistencies and 
confusing language in an earlier version. 
Voting will take place from Feb. 27 through 
March 9, which are Weeks 8 and 9 of winter 
quarter.

Students will approve or reject the 
initiative, which includes a fee hike of $165 
each quarter to establish and maintain a 
competitive program in Division I. In order 
to compete at the new level, UCSD must 
issue a minimum amount of scholarship 
to athletes. UCSD has been competing 
in Division II since 2000 and already has 
Division I programs for fencing, men’s 
volleyball and water polo.

Student Fee Advisory Committee (SFAC) 
chairman Brian McEuen wrote a letter to 
Wing, recommending that the referendum 
be tabled until some of the wording was 
changed, and adjustments to the procedures 
for Intercollegiate Athletic fund regulation 
were made. Wing said that she met privately 
with an SFAC representative and that all of 
SFAC’s concerns had been solved. “[SFAC] 
had written their letter based on a previous 
draft of the referendum,” Wing said. “All of 
the issues were addressed in the final draft.”

Senior Staff Writer

UCSD announced on Dec. 20 that 
Vice Chair of Graduate Chemistry 
and Biochemistry Dan Donoghue was 
appointed as the new Sixth College 
provost.

Former Sixth College Provost Naomi 
Oreskes stepped down on July 1, 2011 
after three years as provost  to focus 
more on research. Oreskes’s research is on 
climate change and the reception of global 
warming. Professor of Mathematics Jim 
Lin was appointed as acting provost for 
fall quarter.

Donoghue has worked at UCSD for 32 
years. Since 1985, he has been the director 
of a program of a training grant funded by 
the National Cancer Institute that brings 
32 faculty researchers together to research 
basic biochemical processes in cancer 
cells. The program also provides funding 
for predoctoral and postdoctoral cancer 
research fellows at UCSD. 

Donoghue has also been a recipient 

of an American Cancer Society Faculty 
Research Award, a Helen Hay Whitney 
Fellowship, a Searle Scholars Fellowship 
and a Senior Faculty Award from the 
Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation.

Donoghue said his interest in 
u n d e r g r a d u a t e 
education began 
when he started 
teaching a lower 
level chemistry 
class 8-9 years ago. 
In 2008, he was 
appointed the Chair 
of the Academic 
Senate where he met 
many people from 
the Student Affairs 

Office and the Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs. He also served on the Committee 
on Student Life and Engagement from 
2007-09 and recently as the co-chair of 
the Senate Administration Joint Task 
Force on Budget.

UCSD Health System to Buy Nevada Cancer Institute
BY JAVIER ARMSTRONG
Staff Writer

UCSD Health System will purchase 
the Nevada Cancer Institute within the 
next four weeks for $18 million. The 
announcement was made Monday, Jan. 
23 in a UCSD press release and follows 
a Jan. 14 ruling by a federal bankruptcy 
court judge approving the sale.

UCSD Health System interim chief 
executive Dr. Thomas McAfee said 
in “UCSD buying Nevada Cancer 
Clinic,” published Jan. 22 in the San 
Diego Union-Tribune, that buying 
the 142,000-square-foot, four-story 
building and its medical practice fits 
into the long-term growth plan of 
the UC Health System. McAfee said 
that UCSD Health Systems will use 
cash reserves to buy the institute and 
that there will be no state or taxpayer 
money used. 

According to McAfee, by 
expanding its patient base, the UCSD 
Health System will be able to expand 
its research and clinical trials and 
increase its education programs. 

     “This expansion will allow us 
to fulfill our mission as the region’s 
only academic medical center,” UCSD 
Health Sciences Communications 
Director Jacqueline Carr said. “We 
will broaden our clinical trials and 
continue to teach the next generation 
of physician-scientists.”

Carr said the out-of-state expansion 
is part of a new model of care that 
hospitals like MD Anderson and 
Stanford have pursued. According to 
Carr, the expansion is a strategic way 
to combine resources and lower costs 
while increasing access to specialized 
care.

This is the UCSD Health System’s 
second expansion to an out-of-state 
facility. UCSD Health System opened 
a comprehensive but small liver clinic 
in Nevada in August 2011. The NVCI 
purchase is the first among the UC 
campuses to expand a large healthcare 
facility outside of California. UCLA 
and UC San Francisco have affiliations 
with other facilities but they are all 
within their surrounding communities.

The $18 million purchasing fee 

includes the institute’s name and 
the flagship building at the institute. 
Additionally, approximately 130 
employees from the NVCI will remain 
at the clinic under the direction of the 
university.

The NVCI opened in 2005 with the 
hope of becoming one of the nation’s 
top cancer research institutions, but 
the recession hit the small independent 
nonprofit and forced it in to bankruptcy 
court on Dec. 2, 2011. According to 
“UCSD buying Nevada Cancer Clinic,” 
the NVCI found itself $100 million in 
debt and laid off 300 of its employees 
last spring. The institute had about 350 
employees before it fell in to financial 
troubles. 

Current NVCI patients will 
continue to see their physicians, but 
if certain treatments are not available 
in Nevada, they will go to San Diego 
where they will be able to consult with 
top physicians and have more trials 
available to them, Dr. Oscar Goodman 
Jr. of the Nevada Cancer Institute said 
in a Las Vegas Review Journal article 
dated Jan. 23.

“Patients coming from Nevada 
would mean better utilization of the 
state-of-the-art facility we have at 
UCSD Moores Cancer Center,” UC 
Regent Charlene Zettel said in the 
“UCSD buying Nevada Cancer Clinic” 
article. 

“It also would be a boost for the San 
Diego economy because patients and 
families would be staying here. Most 
importantly, though, patients would 
get excellent care from some of the best 
doctors in California.”

According to the press release, 
UCSD Health System plans for the 
recruitment of medical and surgical 
oncologists, as well as beginning a 
national search for a physician-scientist 
to serve as director of the institute. 

“We have patients who come from 
all over the world for some of our 
programs,” McAfee told the San Diego 
Union-Tribune. “It makes us better at 
what we do to have adequate clinical 
volume.”

the 60-year-old house does not meet 
current safety standards for natural 
disasters.

The Regents approved the full 
rehabilitation plan of University 
House on Jan. 19, 2012. In total, the 
renovation will cost $10.5 million and 
will be entirely covered by private 
funding. A sum of $1.5 million has 
been allocated from the Edward 
F. Searles Fund, an unrestricted 
endowment used to finance general 
purposes of the university that cannot 
be covered by state funds.

A stabilization operation began 
in November 2011 to insure that the 
large cliff-top house would not crash 
onto the beach below. According to 
principal architect Ione Stiegler, the 
walls are very lightweight and the 
roof/ceiling structural framing is not 
attached to the adobe walls.

Therefore, it is believed that 
the building would be unable to 
resist the physical momentum of 
a seismic event. One major aspect 
of the renovation is to resolve these 
deficiencies by physically connecting 
the roof framing to the load bearing 
walls.

Issues also remain within the 
electrical, mechanical, plumbing, 
gas, telephone, cable and fire service 
systems.

“All of these deficiencies are 
being rectified with the remodel and 
finally, the house has never had a fire 
protection system and that will now 
be provided,” Steigler said.

Another setback that the house’s 
refurbishment faced was the history 
of the land itself. While initially 
the university sought to demolish 
the home and replace it with a new 
one, the project was met with strong 
opposition from the Kumeyaay 
Native American tribe — who once 
lived on the land and buried their 
dead there.

Those within the Native American 
community have also raised concerns 
over the project since UCSD 
employees first came across two 
ancient skeletons in 1976. 

Since 2007, a Native American 
monitor has joined the project team 
to handle any further cases of burial 
disturbance that might occur during 
the renovation and stabilization 
process.

UC-wide policy states that all new 

construction and major renovation 
projects must attain LEED silver 
certification or above. Because 
University House is only a private 
holding of the university, it is exempt 
from this requirement. Nevertheless, 
those in charge of the project have 
been vying for the certification.

“The restoration is including 
many sustainable energy and life 
cycle processes,” Stiegler said. 
“However, the project cannot meet 
current LEED requirements because 
LEED fails to recognize the need to 
maintain certain character-defining 
elements.”

The National Trust for Historic 
Preservation has been appealing to 
the United States Green Building 
Council, which oversees LEED, in 
order to have them recognize the 
inherent environmental benefit of 
rehabilitating an existing building, 
according to Stiegler. 

The second phase is scheduled 
to start construction in April 2012, 
with a projected completion date of 
April 2013.

New Provost to Focus on Full Scale Development of  Sixth College

“I was just more generally 
involved in activities at the campus-
wide level and just really came 
to appreciate how great UCSD is 
and how great our students are,” 
Donoghue said.

Donoghue said it has been an 
honor to be appointed as the Sixth 
College Provost.

“Sixth College people have been 
so welcoming, the staff have been 
really awesome, students are great,” 
Donoghue said. “I’m learning my 
way around Sixth College because 
I’ve been on Revelle campus most of 

the rest of the time. It’s pretty cool.”
Donoghue said he plans to work 

on continuing the development of 
Sixth College, including academic 
buildings, new residential halls and 
new dining facilities. 

The new dining facility has been 
very important to the students.

“I’m kind of hearing that would 
be one of the number one priorities 
for students at Sixth College and that 
the other parts that would go along 
with the full scale development of the 
college,” Donoghue said.

He said it would be easier to start 
working on those now that the trolley 

locations have been established. 
Donoghue said he is excited to 

be a part of the newest college on 
campus.

“I think Sixth College is a work 
that’s still evolving,” Donoghue 
said. “It’s our newest college, it was 
started with tremendous vision by 
the people that really conceptualized 
it at its inception and some parts of 
that vision have been realized and 
other parts of it I think are still in 
development.”

4 THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  MONDAY, JANUARY 30,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

Right before my very eyes — or, maybe while I was napping in onion ring grease up on 
the second floor of Price Center 
East — UCSD underwent a drastic 
reinvention. I’m not talking tuition 
hikes or staff furloughs, changes that 

haven’t escaped even the oblivious and 
the borderline-narcoleptic like myself. 
Over the past three years, we have 
managed to become exponentially 
bourgie. 

There was a time, approximately 
10 minutes before my arrival at 
UCSD in Fall Quarter 2008, that 
there was no Loft. If you, like most 
students, haven’t visited the Loft up 
at Price Center East, I would call it 
a reasonably sterile alternative/indie 
performance space where freshmen 
and grad students are known to stand 
awkwardly/nod noncommittally while 
up-and-coming alternative/indie acts 
do their damndest to rile everybody 
up. The university’s marketers would 
call it a “performance lounge and 
social crossroads where emerging 
art and pop culture collide…a place 
where modern design, appetizing 
bites, and intriguing performance 
commingle.” (Hey, it’s true: they’ve got 
red Ikea chairs outside.) 

What’s so special about the Loft, 
though, is that to me it signaled the 
dawn of a new day at UCSD. All that 
followed is astounding: first came 
Zanzibar, a wildly successful café/
wine bar (yes: it is our campus wine 
bar); then the Bistro, a sit-down 
dining hall in the Village that boasts 
a seasonal menu and a sushi bar; and 
now, this quarter we welcome Roots, 
our campus’s first dedicatedly vegan/
vegetarian eatery. If I didn’t know 
better, I might think Gwyneth Paltrow 
herself were waving a royal hand 
down at us from her castle in the sky, 
blessing us all with Alexander Wang 
T-shirts and warm croissants. 

No corner of campus has gone 
untouched. The transformation is 
evident from the furthest reaches of 
the Village all the way to the School 
of Medicine, where apparently, the 
cheekily dubbed Club Med just 
opened, too. Most of us know that the 
real Club Med is situated eight or so 
miles south, and that it ordinarily calls 
itself the University of San Diego, but 
to USD, we say: “LOL, did you really 
pay $200K for that degree?” (But also: 
“Please, do try the Panini.”)

Desperate for a bathroom on 
a recent weeknight, I wandered 
toward the ambient lights and wall-
length windows of the Bistro. First, 
I hesitated: it had been a long day, 
and I half-expected the hostess — a 
girl I recognized from one lukewarm 
Popov-fueled dorm party or another 
— to appraise my sneakers, wrinkle 
her noise and ask me to please come 
back later. 

But before she could, I looked 
around and what I saw was sort of 
unbelievable: students laughing over 
mineral water. Students smoothing 
cloth napkins in their laps. Students so 
happy — so overjoyed at the sushi and 
friends surrounding them — that, for 
at least an hour, they had forgotten the 
bleakness of everything else.

The Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance recommended 
creating a national digital textbook database 
as a way to lower the cost of textbooks for 
students. However, pursuing a special national 
system is unnecessary because smaller entities 
are already developing their own systems, 
which can successfully reduce textbook prices.

 Sites like PostYourBook.com allow students 
to buy or trade used books with other students. 
The site was recently started at Santa Monica 
College and has spread across the UC system, 
as students are able to sell their books to each 
other with no middle man, enabling discounted 
prices for buyers and more profit than a 
university bookstore would pay the seller. 

Digital books show promise for reducing 
textbook costs. According to an IPRO report, 
digital textbooks can cut textbook costs by 
30-50 percent. California State University 
launched a pilot digital textbook program on 
several of their campuses in 2009. Under this 
program, students were able to rent digital 
textbooks for $60, versus the average $173 
they would pay for paper textbooks. New 
technology such as the Kindle and iPad make a 
future in digital books even more feasible, and 
are already being utilized in some schools for 
education.

It is not in the education system’s best 
interest to waste money and time pursuing 
a national database that may not even be 
efficient, when there are already successful 
cost-cutting methods in existence, and new 
technologies providing hope for further cost 
reduction.

QUICK TAKES THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION’S ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON STUDENT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROPOSED THE CREATION OF A NATIONAL ONLINE TEXTBOOK DATABASE TO REDUCE COSTS OF COURSE MATERIALS.

In an effort to make course materials more affordable for students, the Advisory Committee 
on Student Financial Assistance proposed the 
development of a national electronic textbook 
clearinghouse. Although the clearinghouse would 
help lower the cost of textbooks in the long run, 
its implementation just isn’t feasible. The answer 
to cheaper textbooks lies in colleges utilizing more 
used textbooks, and fewer new editions.

Used textbooks are on average 25 percent 
cheaper than new editions, but only comprise 25 to 
30 percent of textbooks on the market, according 
to the Advisory Committee on Student Financial 
Assistance. The universities themselves have the 
ability to strengthen the market of used textbooks 
by implementing cost-effective initiatives. The 
University of Washington, for example, took the 
initiative to guarantee a buy-back service that 
allows students to sell back their books for up to 
50 percent of their current price. Furthermore, the 
San Mateo County Community College District 
Bookstore enacted a policy of sending faculty 
reminders to turn in used textbooks, leading to a 
27 percent increase in used textbook sales between 
2004 and 2006. Initiatives such as these can save 
students hundreds of dollars.

Faculty can also commit to using the same 
textbook for multiple quarters, only switching to a 
new edition if significant changes have been made. 
This will strengthen the used textbook market, 
providing students with cheaper texts that will also 
encourage publishers to release fewer new editions.

The electronic national database is an ambi-
tious idea but it is just not a feasible option. 
Alternatives such as using more used textbooks are 
both more easily implemented and cost-effective.

 ALEKS LEVIN
Staff Writer

The cost of attending college is rapidly rising, and with it are the escalating costs 
of textbooks. The College Board has predicted 
that the average student at a four-year public 
university will spend $1,137 this year on 
textbooks alone. In 2007, the U.S. Department 
of Education’s Advisory Committee on Student 
Financial Assistance proposed the creation of a 
national digital marketplace that would reduce 
costs by uploading textbooks online. This idea 
is a necessary step towards affordability, as 
any reduction in textbook costs will provide 
welcome relief to already financially burdened 
students.

With its ease of access and promises of 
slashed prices, a national textbook database will 
discourage students from skimping on their 
required texts. The online system would allow 
students to do all the same things that can be 
done in a printed textbook, like highlighting 
passages — with the added plus that it would be 
much easier to search for key terms. Professors 
would also be able to create custom texts online, 
so students would not have to spend copious 
amounts of money on purchasing custom 
course readers. 

Pilot programs have yielded promising 
results. The Cal State system began testing out 
a service called the “Digital Marketplace” on 
several of its campuses in 2009. The program 
showed that 73 percent of students participated 
in the program, at a 65 percent cost reduction. 
This groundbreaking innovation could mark the 
first step towards providing students with the 
materials they need to succeed in their classes, 
at prices they can afford.

TALKING POINTS UC STUDENT REGENTS TALK POLICY

UC Student Regent Alfredo Mireles Jr. and UC Student Regent-designate Jonathan Stein visited UCSD on Jan. 29 as part of their campus tour. 
Each of the student regents serves for a two-year term, 
one as a non-voting designate and one in full capacity 
as the sole student voice on the 26-member UC Board 
of Regents. �e Guardian interviewed Mireles and Stein 
about their goals and special projects, the recent police 
violence and more — here are some highlights from our 
conversation.
---------------------------------------------------------------
Guardian: What is your opinion on the recent violence 
and protests at UC Riverside, and do you condone the 
tactics of the police, such as using paintball guns �lled 
with pepper lead?
Alfredo Mireles: I had the unique opportunity to 
go between the Regents and the protesters, so I was 
amongst the protesters for over two hours and got to 
meet with many of them, answer their questions and 
somewhat participate. We’re both angry about a lot of 
the same issues that protesters are, and any time there is 
violence between police and students, it just makes me 
sick. 
I never want to see any students hurt, and I’m not a 
policing expert so it’s really hard to condone [the police 
tactics]. It’s just very challenging for both sides when 
passion gets so high. I wish they didn’t have to use those 
tactics.
G: What are some of the projects or issues that are 
you particularly interested in working on during your 
tenures as Student Regent? Alfredo, I know that you’ve 
been involved with making the UC campuses tobacco 
free, but what about you, Jonathan?
Jonathan Stein: I think every Student Regent enters with 

an agenda, and then you get knocked o� your agenda 
almost immediately. For example, UCSF now has this 
plan to make itself this quasi-independent body, and 
I suspect that’s going to be a huge part of the next 18 
months, and that’s not something I had any intention of 
dealing with when I took the job. �at said, my priorities 
coming in were to �nd new funding for public higher 
education and stopping fee increases. My second priority 
was campus climate issues — I don’t need to tell UC San 
Diego how important campus climate issues are. I serve 
on a system-wide Campus Climate Steering Committee 
and while I think individual campuses are making some 
gains, we still have yet to deliver on the full promises 
made by the administration a year and a half ago, 
when we had our most challenging moments. I’m also 
interested in making the UC a more e�ective political 
force in Sacramento.
G: As Student Regents, your job is to represent all 
220,000 students of the UC system; as graduate 
students, how will you ensure that you are still in 
touch with undergraduate issues?
JS: When we travel to a campus, the vast majority of 
people we meet with are undergraduates, the people we 
seek out �rst are undergraduates, the network of student 
leads I’ve built is almost entirely undergraduates, and 
the issues that I spend 40 hours a week working on are 
issues of importance for undergraduates. I don’t have 
any preference for graduate students in my work.
G: You mentioned that the administration sees out-of-
state students as a source of funding — what are your 
thoughts about the plans to increase the number of 
out-of-state admits?

Regents Eager to Send Students to Sacramento Rally

QUITE FRANKLY By Lior Schenk LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Dear Editor,
The recent article written by 

sports columnist Nick Howe on 
Jan. 23, concerning the upcoming 
student referendum to move 
UCSD to a berth in NCAA 
Division I athletics was inaccurate, 
incomplete and seemingly biased. 
Mr. Howe has joined the pervasive 
administrative drumbeat of: 
Division I is the answer to our 
enhanced school spirit prayers.

When 60,000 people apply for 
admission to this school as they did 
this year, how can we claim to have 
a school spirit problem? I assume 
that most of those applying know 
something of the nature of this 
campus before they apply. They, by 
all appearances, are not concerned 
with this so-called lack of school 
spirit.

In his article, Nick Howe 
compares UCSD to UCLA as if we 
are a downtrodden stepsister. Our 
Recreation Department is 10 times 
more dynamic than UCLA’s, we 
have a gorgeous beach, our school 
is the no. 1 surf school, we have our 
own unique resources and school 
environment. If this is a contest on 
who is the biggest and baddest U.C., 
which I don’t think it should be, we 
can definitely hold our own. 

And just how would a jump to 
Division I status solve this phantom 
lack of school spirit?

First, understand that we 
won’t be hosting the likes of Cal 
and Stanford? Our move to DI 
would give us possible entry to 
the Big West Conference. Here are 
their member schools:  Cal State 
Fullerton, Cal Poly SLO, Cal State 
Northridge, Cal State Long Beach, 
UC Davis, UC Irvine, UC Riverside, 
UC Santa Barbara, University of the 

Pacific. There are no Cals, Stanfords 
or UCLAs in the line up.

Our ICA program has 
historically existed to enhance the 
students’ athletic pursuits in a very 
pure form. That’s been a hallmark 
of UCSD — that our programs 
are student participation driven 
and somewhat egalitarian. That 
is something to be proud of. But, 
lately the intercollegiate program, 
time and again, has gone to the 
funding feeding trough via student 
referendums to finance their leap-
frogging ambitions to jump from 
Division III to currently Division 
II (2007 referendum), and next 
Division I. Naturally the position 
of the administration has been that 
this move is to enhance student 
life. From my perspective the only 
student lives being enhanced are 
those who will receive scholarships 
from this referendum windfall. 
Ironically, most of the current 
athletes will be voting themselves 
off their teams.

For this referendum to pass, a 
mere 5,500 or so students have to 
vote and only half of those votes, or 
more accurately 50.1 percent have 
to be “yes.” And you, the ‘average’ 
student will be in the hole to the 
tune of $500 per year. 

The choice is yours, but only if 
you are fully informed.

AM: First and foremost, it’s important that we don’t 
dehumanize out-of-state students. I found that in 
this debate, o�entimes we third-party our out-of-
state students, and we need to remind people when 
we’re talking about this issue that we cannot create an 
environment in which they feel like it’s hostile to them. 
We need to treat them with the same tact and sensitivity 
that other communities would like to be talked about, as 
they’re our students too. 
JS: My concern with out-of-state is, one, the lack of both 
ethnic and economic diversity, and two, the way in which 
the institution may be less accessible to in-state California 
students. Here’s the real point that I think is missed when 
you talk about crowding students out: by increasing 
our out-of-state numbers, we’re not displacing in-state 
students. We have room in the UC for the same number 
of in-state students plus more out-of-state. �e problem 

is that the out-of-state students apply predominantly to 
UC Berkeley, UCLA, UCSD, which then pushes in-state 
students to other campuses. All of our institutions are 
fabulous, but we have a couple “elite” campuses, and we 
don’t want fewer Californians to be able to access them. 
G: What’s next? What are you two working on now?
JS: We are focusing on the May 16 rally in Sacramento; 
we’re trying to get the Regents to pay for all the buses, 
try to work with administration and faculty to forgive 
absences in class so there’s no penalty for students for 
going to Sacramento. If you can get 50 buses and they’re 
all completely paid for — let’s �ll those suckers. 
AM: It’s great that the Regents want to work with 
students, but at the end of the day, the Regents will be 
�ne. �ey have lives established and what happens to the 
UC will not personally a�ect them. But if we get further 
cuts by Sacramento, students will feel the pain, so this has 
to be our rally.

It’s Your 
Life: Try 
Making 
Time For It
B ehold, the greatest barrier between you and the best version of you, the obstacle that holds you back from 
doing everything on your bucket list and 
the reason why your Nike Airs are still in 

mint condition. It’s why your New Year’s 
resolutions died the same week they were 
born and why purchasing that yoga sub-
scription was a total waste of money.

The time excuse.
It’s the accepted norm in our culture 

that you will never have enough time — 
24-hours just doesn’t cut it anymore.

But here’s a news flash: Even if we had 
80 hours in a day, we’d still be using the 
time excuse.

For the past decade or so we’ve been 
coming up with the reasons behind 
America’s troubling obesity epidemic. But 
whether it’s that our lives have become 
increasingly sedentary, or that we’re con-
suming too much calorie-dense and pro-
cessed food, America’s health problems 
can be traced back further to the tragic 
belief that we simply don’t have the time 
to be investing in our health.

It’s alarming how far the time excuse 
goes. We don’t just neglect our physical 
health, but also our mental health. You 
probably can’t remember the last time 
you sat back and just let your mind go 
blank for a minute or two (and day-
dreaming in the uncomfortable chairs 
in the Solis lecture halls during your 
anthropology class does not count as 
meditation). Not just your health, but 
also your environment (also known as 
your messy room and obscenely large 
laundry bag.) Even your relationships 
are damaged by your insistence that you 
don’t have time (please refer to your 
mother’s eight voicemails).

It’s true that living a healthy life, 
in terms of your body, mind and soul, 
does entail its fair share of planning and 
dedication. It seems much easier to grab 
a McMuffin on your way to your 8 a.m. 
lecture than it is to slice up an apple for 
breakfast. And when balancing a full load 
of classes, an internship and a social life, 
who has the time to go to RIMAC?

Actually, you do.
Take a minute to undo everything 

society has conditioned you to believe, 
and see how much of your life you can 
change without missing a beat. Delete 
the phrase, “I don’t have time” from your 
thoughts and your speech for just a week.

Wake up just one half hour earlier 
and go for that early morning run. Take 
one quick trip to the super market and 
stock up on some essentials, and you’re 
set for a week with some healthier study 
snacks. Go ahead, don’t be afraid to take 
a five minute break, only five minutes, 
to clear your head with some medita-
tion and notice how much more relaxed 
and energized you are after. Setting aside 
these little corners will hardly set you 
back and keep you from doing the work 
you need to do.

Slowly but surely, the more you force 
yourself to believe that you do have the 
time, the truer it becomes. With enough 
practice, and by eliminating the excuses, 
you’ll learn to start making your well-
being, both mental and physical, a prior-
ity. Self-discipline is like any muscle in 
our body — only strong if properly con-
ditioned. So get on that bench press.

A SIGH 
OF RELIEF

Meditation is a word that comes with a set of stereotypical associations: elaborate tantric practices, monks dressed in robes sitting inside an incense and chime-adorned temple, spend-
ing hours in lotus position while repeatedly chanting the 
word “om.”

But meditating isn’t just for Buddha. A universal and 
multicultural custom, meditation is becoming increasingly 
popular in Western culture, used not only as a religious tool, 
but also as a natural way to eliminate stress, tame anxiety 
and promote greater focus and awareness — as doctors and 
experts find more and more medical evidence to back up the 
claims of its usefulness.

Despite its long list of short and long-term benefits, 
consistent, daily meditation practice may seem more like a 
burden than a hobby, especially for the American college 
student. For the average undergrad to sit down and render 

blank a mind that’s been racing and active all day is no easy 
feat, and to find a time and a place to do it is a whole other 
challenge.

But Mehrad Nazari, Ph.D, attests that meditation is tool 
that can be utilized by all.

“It is compatible with any lifestyle,” Nazari said.
Nazari himself has used the practice to balance his own 

life in the corporate world. He’s earned an MBA and Ph.D. in 
human behavior, taught at the U.S. International University 
for 10 years and runs a real estate company.

Yet he has also maintained a spiritual side to his life for 
the past 25 years. After being trained in Indian Vedic prac-
tice by his Zen master (who he mentioned is soon approach-
ing his 105th birthday) and an initiation into Himalayan 
Yogic traditions, Nazari now serves as a meditation instruc-

HAVE A DRINK ON US

S an Diego is no stranger to breakfast joints, which is why it’s so hard to get excited about new kids on the breakfast block — we’ve 
already got hot spots like Broken Yolk and Hash 
House a Go Go satisfying our hunger for the occa-
sional pancake stack or omelet anyway. But early 
risers beware: Some real competition is finally 
here. Snooze, an a.m. eatery, headed west last 
November all the way from Colorado (where it’s a 
local favorite) to set up shop in Hillcrest. 

After only a few months here, the restaurant is 
already buzzing. It’s not uncommon to see a crowd 
of people waiting outside to be called — hallelujah 
for 30 minutes, a serious nod for an hour — but 
once inside everything is forgiven. The sky high 
ceilings and all glass store front give space for you 
to relax, while the light atmosphere of this retro-
furnished eatery is brought out not only by the 
summery colors that fill the big space, but also 
(more so) by the enthusiasm of the servers. On a 
side note, a nice bar is located at the right of the 

entrance — yes, Snooze 
sells alcohol (mimosas, 
and lots of ‘em).

One of the unique 
features of Snooze is 
that you can customize 
your own meals. Upon 
requests, it’s possible 
to combine dishes 
together without an 
extra charge. 

The Pancake Flight 
($9) is a great way to 
save money since it 
allows you to choose 
any three pancake fla-

vors, including the pancake of the day. We opted 
for a popular trio: the Pineapple Upside Down 
Pancake, the Red-Eye Velvet Pancake and Ichabod 
Crane’s Pancake. 

The Pineapple Upside Down Pancake is an 
exceptionally fluffy, moist and warm pancake with 
caramelized pineapple chunks inside, and house-
made vanilla crème anglaise with cinnamon butter 
lightly dripping over. With the right amount of 
milky sweetness enveloping your tongue as it melts 
in your mouth, this pancake is a standout. 

The Red-Eye Velvet Pancake is the weakest 
of the bunch — a bland red velvet buttermilk 
pancake topped with indistinguishable espresso 
infused maple syrup, a light cream cheese frosting 
and chopped pecans. 
Its flavors were so 
subdued that they 
didn’t synchronize 
very well at all, and 
thus, did not leave 
much of an impres-
sion.

Ichabod Crane’s 
Pancake, an unfor-
gettable one-of-a-
kind buttermilk pan-
cake sprinkled with 
candied pumpkin 
seeds, and topped 
with mellow yellow 
pumpkin cream and a chili-spiced Vermont maple 
syrup, had an amazing mix of buttery and smooth 
flavor with a finishing taste of sweet pumpkin. A 
tinge of spice and pumpkin embraced each other 

firmly in unison.
But Snooze isn’t all pancakes. Corn Beef Hash 

($9.50) — with its signature shredded hash mixed 
with an ample amount of corned beef, caramel-
ized poblanos and onions, with two eggs and toast 
or tortillas on its side — is recommendable for 
brunch, since it’s a bit too meat-heavy and salty for 
breakfast.

Ham Benedict III ($9.50), a soft and crunchy 
signature English muffin topped with slices of 
hickory smoked ham, soft poached eggs and 
smoked cheddar hollandaise, is a savory breakfast 
dish that is good for both breakfast and brunch. 
The golden-brown house hash browns that come 
on the side help in toning down the impressive, yet 
strong hollandaise taste. 

Hitting equally upon the savory and the sweet, 
Snooze is a breakfast joint anyone’s taste buds can 
appreciate. But with a 20-minute car ride from 
campus and a typically long wait, it’s a place for a 
worthy occasion — not a weekly tradition.

RESTAURANT REVIEW

The Guardian asked Jason 
Whittington, a bartender at 
Waterfront Bar and Grill in 
Little Italy, to recommend a 
drink. This is his choice.

TEQUILA FRESH

This refreshing drink is a 
new school take on the old 
school margarita. The crisp 
combination of fresh lime 
juice and spear-muddled 
cucumber brightens up a 
meal with its sweet, light 
flavors. Similar to salt on 

watermelon, a pinch of salt 
and pepper in this smooth 
drink highlights the sweet 
notes of the agave nectar.

INGREDIENTS

1/2 oz agave nectar
1/2 oz fresh lime juice

1 cucumber spear-muddled
2 oz tequila

Shake ingredients, strain over 
ice and add cucumber and a

RESTAURANT REVIEW

tor at UCSD’s “The Zone,” which holds meditation sessions 
several times a quarter.

There is an endless list of different types of meditation found 
around the world, but Nazari explained the core philosophy 
rooted in all of them.

“Meditation is gathering the forces of our mind to direct 
them into one focused channel,” he said. “It’s focusing that con-
centrated energy to connect with our supreme self, to that inner 
intelligence, that inner wisdom that is connected to the univer-
sal energy field.”

Nazari explained that many of the ailments we suffer from 
in our daily lives — issues like depression, anxiety and stress 
— can all be rooted in a loss of connection with that “universal 
energy field,” and a disjoint between the mind and body.

“Every single cell in the body works in unison to work 
toward one goal,” he said. “As a human being we forget this and 
we think we are separate and we claim independence from that 
system. And that is where the disease depression and anxiety 
[come from] and all the miseries of the world come from — 

that separation.”
Medical experts have attached 

a long plethora of benefits to con-
sistent, daily meditation practice, 
confirming Nazari’s assertion that 
meditation can help alleviate not 
only constant stress and anxiety, 
but combat the physical symptoms 
associated with them, such as high 
cholesterol and high blood pres-
sure. What is left behind, he said, 
is clarity, peace, greater joy and a 
focused mind.

“In the long term, once we really 
connect to our true essence, all 
these things fade away and we work 
in unison with everything around 
us,” Nazari said.

Additionally, there’s plenty to 
be gained by an average UCSD student who’s constantly on the 
academic grind — a relaxed mind is more receptive to learn-
ing than a stressed one is, making meditation an effective study 
tool.

“It’s basically a tool for sharpening your mind,” Nazari said. 
“The retention of what you learn is a lot higher, and access to 
that information is a lot easier. You make this whole idea of 
education a lot easier once you can place [your thoughts] in a 
proper place in your brain and get access to it.”

While many have given it a try, the inability to clear a mind 
jumbled full of thoughts can be discouraging, and is often the 
main reason people give up the practice after a few tries. While 

it’s a common complaint, it’s certainly no reason to give up, 
Nazari explained.

“The Dalai Lama was in New York and one of my friends 
asked him why it’s so hard for Americans to meditate,” he said. 
“He’s so funny, his holiness Dalai Lama. He waved his hand up 
and said, ‘Oh, you Americans think everything is about you. I 
am the Dalai Lama and it’s hard for me to meditate!’” 

The key is to let your mind run its course without worrying 
about reaching a blank state. 

“In the western world, we associate with the whole idea of 
‘I think therefore I am,’ and it’s just the cause of our problem,” 
Nazari said, explaining that to practice meditation, one needs 
to be detached from thoughts, not eliminate them altogether. 
“So when we sit down and we see that train of thoughts going 
across, not associating with any one thought, that will help you 
make a separation. That separation is the first successful stop 
toward meditation.”

According to Nazari, the mind thinks between 60 to 90,000 
thoughts a day, 90 percent of those being repeated thoughts 
from the day before. That kind of repeated cycle of endless 
thinking by an uncontrollable mind is a key reason behind 
mental exhaustion. Practicing mental control can help alleviate 
the constant agitation from what Nazari calls our mind playing 
“a broken record.”

As for finding the time and place, an hour seated in the lotus 
position in your dorm room is not required.

UCSD provides multiple opportunities to attend guided 
meditation sessions, like Nazari’s quarterly guided instructions 
at The Zone. Additionally, his wife, Michele Hebert, will be 
instructing a weekly meditation class at RIMAC beginning in 
spring quarter, available to students for about $20.

But Nazari said it’s the “meanwhile” practices done mul-
tiple times a day that students can get the most out of. To start, 
Nazari said, you can find a quiet, isolated place, or even small 
pockets of time throughout the day. Spend two minutes engaged 
in abdominal breathing, or breathing in a way that fills up the 
stomach instead of just the upper chest. That kind of breathing 
is a signal to the brain to begin relaxing. Then, it’s simply a mat-
ter of focusing on your breath, and letting your thoughts run 
their course without associating with any one thought.

“Use it like a snack throughout the day,” Nazari said.
Another technique is to repeat a word, or find a mantra.
“That word, in our teaching, is peace, harmony or well-

being,” he said. “Once you repeat those words, you have no 
choice but to get in that state.”

It’s especially important not to get your ego wrapped up in it. 
Developing meditation skills is like building any other habit — 
it takes practice. 

“Don’t get discouraged,” Nazari said. “There are days that it 
gets a lot easier to sit down and get to that calm state, there are 
days that the mind has been agitated, activated and it takes a 
little bit longer. It’s a matter of patience, consistency and toler-

PRICE CENTER EAST BALLROOM
'The Room' is a 2003 independent drama film starring 
Tommy Wiseau, who also wrote, directed, and produced 
the feature. The film has been dubbed 'the Citizen Kane 
of bad movies' and one of the worst films ever made. 
Originally only shown in a limited number of California 
theaters, the film quickly developed a cult following as 
fans found humor in the film's various technical and 
narrative flaws. Within a decade of its premier, the film 
was selling out showings around the United States and 
had inspired a video game, book, and traveling stage 
show. Undergrads: $5 General Public: $10

SHOW YOUR TRITON PRIDE DURING 
TRITON SPIRIT WEEK FROM 

JAN.30TH - FEB.3RD!

BY NICK HOWE
Associate Sports Editor

After losing four games by a margin of only five points, the Triton Men’s Basketball team went into this week-
end hard set for a win. 

“We have a game plan,” sophomore James 
McCann said. “Coach [Carlson] does a good 
job preparing us. So if we execute then we 
should come away with wins.”

However, the weekend did not go as 
planned, as the men’s basketball team came 
away disappointed by back-to-back losses to 
Cal Poly Pomona and San Francisco State 
University. 

On both occasions, the Tritons were short-
handed, with seniors Christian Hatch and 
Ryan Peters on the bench due to injuries 
sustained at Cal State Monterey Bay several 

weeks ago. 
Yet younger players have started to step up 

in the Triton lineup to compensate. 
McCann has been recording big numbers 

for UCSD since the start of the season, taking 
on much of the burden of Hatch’s absence.      

The sophomore picked up 15 points against 
Pomona, where the Tritons came within one 
point with only 1:26 in regulation. 

But Pomona pulled away quickly to end the 
game in their favor, 58-50, allowing them to 
hold on to first place in the CCAA at 9-4.

Sophomore slashing guard MacKenzie 
McCullough had a good game, nabbing nine 
points and three boards.

Junior shooting guard Tyler McGrath has 
been either hot or cold for the Tritons in 2012. 
McGrath had 17 points against Pomona, sink-
ing nine for nine of his free throws and going 
3-7 from the floor.

“I am very proud of our effort tonight,” 

Carlson said to the UCSD athletics depart-
ment. “We didn’t shoot it well all night, but 
we gave ourselves chances to win late. You 
have to credit Pomona. They are a good team 
and make things very tough on you. That was 
certainly the case this evening.”

Saturday’s game against San Francisco State 
was another story altogether. McGrath went 
0-6 from the floor and shot 2-4 from the line. 
McGrath’s streaky play often makes the differ-
ence in UCSD’s close games, as McGrath’s play 
from the perimeter has proven key. 

Brue pulls down around 10 points and 
five rebounds a game while McCann can be 
counted on for 15 plus points and a handful 
of assists. 

McGrath needs to find a way to be “on” all 
the time, or the Tritons will continue to lose, 
especially without Hatch.

This was highlighted against San Francisco, 
who dominated in the paint, scoring 24 points 

to San Diego’s 14 points. 
Without Hatch, the Tritons have no other 

bigs to step in after senior forward Ryan 
Wheeler steps out to take a breather, which 
means UCSD’s opposition can open up big 
gaps with inside scoring and rebounding 
while the Tritons can do anything about it. 

San Francisco took the game 56-45, and 
they never led by less than  six points after 
the half.

This Friday’s coming game against Cal 
State Los Angeles will be at home for Spirit 
Night at 7:30 pm. 

The game will be a turning point: Either 
the Tritons will be able to salvage a season, or 
start looking at getting freshman and sopho-
mores more playing time to try for a better 
result next season.

Men’s Basketball Fails to Find a Win on the Road

BY NICK HOWE
Associate Sports Editor

Competing in the Division I Mountain Pacific Sports Federation, the men’s volleyball 
team dropped both their games over 
the weekend against No. 6 Pepperdine 
University and No. 5 USC. The Tritons 
are now 1-4 in conference play.

After losing five seniors last year, 
the men’s volleyball team has an almost 
entirely new lineup. The only returner 
from last year’s No. 12 ranked team 
is junior outside hitter Carl Eberts. 
Last year, as co-Captain, Eberts led the 
Tritons in kills, attack attempts, digs 
and points. 

On Friday, the Tritons overcame an 
initial deficit of 10 points to take the 
first game 26-24. The Tritons played 
well, but erratically, as they let the Waves 
keep plays alive after what should have 
been easy kills for the Tritons. 

The second game was not as close, as 

Pepperdine’s service upped the tempo 
and forced the Tritons into small errors. 
The Tritons fell behind 14-25, evening 
the set score at one game apiece.

The third game saw the Tritons pick 
up their defense as Pepperdine suffered 
from a cold streak from the service line, 
where it committed 19 errors on the 
night. The Tritons made quick work of 
the Waves’ mistakes and took the game 
25-22. 

Pepperdine setter Matt West caught 
fire in the fourth game as he built to 62 
assists for the match. However, UCSD 
fought hard and kept the game close 
until the Waves pulled away to take the 
fourth game 23-25.

In the tiebreaker, the Waves looked 
like a completely different team as they 
handed the Tritons a 15-11 win to take 
the match.

Eberts led the Tritons with 16 
kills, while junior transfer hitter Troy 
Tomasello had 11.

On Saturday, the Tritons were swept 

by No. 5 USC. The scores were 25-21, 
25-14 and 27-25. In the match the 
Tritons hit only .121, their second low-
est attack percentage since hitting .000 
in the season opener against Hawaii.

Conversely, the Trojans hit .309, 
amassing 39 kills in 81 attacks com-
pared to the Tritons’ 32 of 90. Despite 
the sweep, the Tritons stayed close the 
whole match. 

The Tritons had every opportunity, 
but failed to execute as deflections went 
inches wide or dropped just a hair’s 
breadth from a defender’s fingertips.

Sophomore setter Mike Brunsting  
led the team with seven digs, while also 
accruing 21 assists and three service 
aces.

The Tritons will now face Princeton 
on Wednesday at 5 p.m. at RIMAC 
arena before going to Fullerton on 
Saturday.

UCSD Men’s Volleyball Drops Fourth Straight Match

12 THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  MONDAY, JANUARY 30,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

BY RACHEL UDA 
Sports Editor

The UCSD Women’s Basketball team continues its undefeated streak, taking two wins last 
weekend from Cal Poly Pomona on 
Thursday, Jan. 26 and San Francisco 
State on Saturday, Jan. 28.

On Thursday, No. 1 UCSD 
topped the No. 22 Broncos — the 
only other nationally ranked squad 
in the CCAA — 69-53. 

The Tritons raced out to a sev-
en-point lead off of five consecu-
tive points from junior guard Emily 
Osga. 

The Broncos responded, going 
on a 10-0 run that gave them a 
three-point lead just four minutes into the 
game.

Cal Poly Pomona wouldn’t hold the 
advantage for long, as the Tritons capitalized 
on their next three possessions. 

With a slim two-point margin, UCSD 
head coach Charity Elliot brought on her 
underclassmen reserves, relieving all Triton 

starters except for senior All-American 
Chelsea Carlisle. 

Carlisle, who led all scorers with 18 
points, five assists and six boards, headed 
a Triton offense reinvigorated by fresh legs. 
UCSD ended the half with a seven-point 
lead.

“Our defense was really good against 
Pomona, and we were pretty much on the 
same page and working well together in that 

game,” Osga said.
In the second half, 

the Tritons displayed 
their usual spot-on 
shooting, going 51.7 
percent from the field 
on 15 of 29 shooting. 

Defensively, UCSD 
limited Pomona to just 
a 33 percent field goal 
percentage.

“Coming into the 
gym we had vengeance 
on our minds because 
[Pomona] beat us last 
season, so we wanted 
to come out and beat 

them pretty badly,” Osga said. “And we 
played good for the most part, our offense 
was not nearly what it could have been 
because we kind of let them close down 
a little bit but we played amazing defense 
which made up for our offense that wasn’t 
doing as well.”

On Saturday, the Tritons faced San 

Francisco State, who currently sits in sixth 
place in the conference with a 5-9 CCAA 
record.

“Once again, our offense kind of slowed 
us down and we didn’t get on transition as 
we should have, but if we just do what we did 
on defense and get our stuff there, then we’re 
going to be successful,” Osga said. 

The Gators led for the first five minutes 
of the game, but lost the lead after back-
to-back three pointers by Triton shooting 
guards Osga and senior Daisy Feder. 

From there, the Triton backcourt caught 
fire as Feder, Osga and Carlisle combined 
for 47 points. 

Taking a 12-point lead into the second 
half, the Gators couldn’t muster much of a 
comeback as UCSD held San Francisco State 
to under 34 percent from the field. 

“We were never really in sync tonight 
offensively, but we still found a way to get a 
win on the road,” Elliot said to UCSD athlet-
ics officials. “It’s always a battle on the road 
and San Francisco State played really hard. 
Our defense was the difference again for us 
tonight.”

The Tritons return to RIMAC for their 
next two matches. 

On Friday at Spirit Night, UCSD will 
face Cal State Los Angeles at 5:30 p.m., 
and on Saturday the Tritons will take on 
Cal State Dominguez Hills at 5:30 p.m.
