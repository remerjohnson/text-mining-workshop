University of California President Mark 
Yudof announced on Oct. 14 that a 17-person 
advisory committee will aid in the selection 
of Chancellor Marye Anne Fox’s replacement. 
The committee is aiming to hire the next 
chancellor by May 2012. 

“The advisory committee was released 
last week; however, the committee has not 
yet convened so I am unable to provide 
any information,” A.S. President Alyssa 
Wing said in a prepared statement. “I do 
know that the advisory committee will be 
seeking input from a variety of different 
communities including staff, faculty, students 
and other community members. This is an 
extensive and thorough process that will 
include opportunities for important campus 
communities to provide input and identify 
the qualities they are looking for in the next 
chancellor.”

Although the committee’s first meeting 
is closed to the general public, committee 
member Wing welcomes input from 
students in choosing the next chancellor. 
Undergraduate students are invited to attend 
a closed input session with the committee in 
its first meeting on Oct. 28. 

“This is one of the only times in which 
undergraduate students, other than myself, 
will be able to participate in a session during 
the selection process,” Wing said.  

Interested students can email Wing for 
more information. The 45-minute session is 
limited to 15 undergraduate students. 

The session coincides with the committee’s 
first meeting.

Last Wednesday, A.S. Council passed the 
annual executive budget at a record pace of 
just over one hour. In past years, it has taken 
council until 1 a.m. or even two full meetings 
to pass a budget.

“One of the biggest things that differed 
from past year is preparation,” A.S. President 
Alyssa Wing said in an email. “There were 
more people reviewing the budget than ever 
before. Vice President of Finance Kevin Hoang 
charged a Budget Appropriations Committee 
comprised of senators, and had the committee 
review past spending trends.”

Wing and Hoang also put together an 
introductory presentation the week before the 
budget was discussed. Over 50 hours were spent 
in getting the $3.1 million budget organized.

“We cleaned up the budget by making it 
more reflective of our actual expendable funds,” 
Wing said. “The previous budget included 
some numbers that could mislead us to believe 
we had more money than in actuality.”

 A.S. Council traditionally over-allocates 
funding to help ensure that all of the year’s 
student fees are used for the students who paid 
into it. To help make up for the $25,000 that 
was overspent last year, A.S. Council didn’t 
over-allocate as much this year.

“The current budget has been reviewed by 
numerous individuals in every aspect. Unless 
there is an enormous enrollment drop, the 
over-allocation should work great,” Wing 
said. “We normally have some carry-forward 
amount, but this year we did not.”

The budget will be available on the A.S. 
website for students to review.

“If there are any questions, students can

For some, the ideal study break would consist of climbing the Great Wall of China, or sipping tea on a balcony in Istanbul. Others want to ditch MTV 
spring break specials to volunteer in Ecuador. 

If it’s a case of wanderlust you suffer from, 
UCSD’s extensive study abroad program has a 
long list of options.

“UCSD offers more choices than any 
other UC,” James Galvin, a director in the 
Programs Abroad office, said. “We’ve always 
been recognized as one of the leaders within 
the Universities of California in the field [of 
studying abroad].“ 

For the aspiring jetsetter, the Programs 
Abroad office, located in the International 
Center, offers several different programs.

The Education Abroad Program (EAP) is 
the most popular, spanning 30 countries and 
100 universities worldwide, and offers almost 
every major.

The University Council - American Federation 
of Teachers is protesting the UC online pilot class 
program. The union members are trying to use 
their bargaining power to stop the program 
because they claim threatens their job security. 

According to a new provision, the university 
has to notify the union in case of a change 
to a term or condition of employment in the 
Memorandum of Understanding between the 
university and the union. UC - AFT President 
Bob Samuels said that the new provision made 
to stop the UCs from creating online classes gives 
the union veto power over any online program 
that it believes will negatively affect teaching jobs.

“We feel we could stop almost any online 
program through this contract,” Samuels said 
in the Oct. 11 Inside Higher Ed article, “The 
Lecturers’ Filibuster.”

The university stated that the union does not 

have the power to shut down the program.
“They do not have the power to block the 

university from implementing new online 
programs,” Spokeswoman for the Office of the 
President Dianne Klein said in an Oct. 11 Inside 
Higher Ed article “The Lecturers’ Filibuster.”

Klein says the union cannot do anything more 
than provide a written notice that they do not like 
and agree with the program, which would hold 
the university to a discussion about the program 
with them no later than January 2013. 

Klein also said that although online classes 
could affect lecturers, they are not a valid reason 
to fire faculty.

“We couldn’t say, ‘Oh, we’ve got a computer 
program that can do your work — we’re getting 
rid of you,” Klein said. 

The Online Instruction Pilot Project was 
created to test the effectiveness of online classes. If 
the program is successful, it will be integrated into 
the UC’s undergraduate curriculum by Jan. 2013. 

Members of the UC - AFT are worried that 

the online classes will cut teachers’ pay or replace 
UC faculty through outsourcing.

In 2009, California State University at 
Bakersfield administrators laid off four math 
instructors and created two math classes in 
its place based on mandatory lab time and an 
e-tutoring program. The program proved to 
be successful when it added the supervision of 
teaching assistants. 

UC- AFT has many concerns regarding 
the online pilot program. Union members are 
worried that there are not enough funds to 
support the program. They question the idea that 
the classes will be less expensive.

“We also do not believe that online courses as 
a platform will be able to maintain the quality of 
instruction expected by UC students,” UC-AFT 
said on their website.

UC-AFT has posted a list of guidelines they 
would like the UC system to follow with the 
integration of online classes on the website. They 
have not yet taken any formal action.

“Make sure that no one loses a course or a 
job because classes are moved online: regulate 
workload; protect intellectual property; ensure 
academic freedom,” UC-AFT said.

Professor of Electrical Engineering at UCLA 
and Nonresident Senior Fellow at the Brookings 
Institution John Villasenor wrote an opinion 
piece in the Los Angeles Times regarding the issue. 
Villasenor thinks that the option of online classes 
is incredible because it can reach people across 
the world.   But he does not think it is a good 
alternative to teaching.

“Something is lost when the classroom 
experience becomes virtual,” Villasenor said in 
“Online teaching’s disconnect,” a Sept. 28 Los 
Angeles Times article, “Instructors owe it to their 
students to be in the classroom, and students owe 
it to themselves – and the rest of us – to do their 
best to be there as well.”

Council Allocates Additional $2,000 for Hullabaloo 
direct them to Kevin [Hoang] or 
myself,” Wing said. “We have put many 
hours into ensuring that our budget 
will benefit the students we represent 
and serve.”

Overall, councilmembers have 
received positive feedback regarding 
the budget.

“During the open forum portion 
of...the budget meeting, there were 
many A.S. members noting the 
efficiency of the new A.S. Council 
and the budget process,” Wing said. 
“We have received positive feedback 
from staff as well in how the whole 
budget process was a collaborative and 
constructive process - not adversarial 
as it has been in the past.”

However, the budget was challenged 
during the meeting. The first came 
with the budget for the new fall quarter 
event, Hullabaloo. Traditionally, the 
main concert event of fall quarter is 
Fall Fest, which presents three musical 
artists. Last year, this event cost A.S. 
Council about $135,000.

This year, A.S. 
Council allocated 
$60,500 to the 
event, which was 
the primary reason 
for the creation 
of the Hullabaloo 
event, which 
is more like a 
carnival event than 
a concert event. 
Since it is a new 
event, however, 
Associated Vice 
President of 
Concerts and 

Events Oliver Zhang asked council for 
additional funds.

“Since this is the first year of this 
concert, I think we need to invest now 
or we could lose an opportunity in the 
future,” Zhang said during the A.S. 
Council meeting.

Zhang emphasized that the extra 
money would mostly be helpful in 
ensuring that the event didn’t go over-

budget, rather than a necessity to make 
sure the event got off the ground. The 
Hullabaloo budget passed at $62,500.

The Office of External Affairs 
requested a $2,000 contingency fund 
— an emergency fund for unforeseen 
circumstances — due to travel 
expenses that the office has had to face 
in the past. Since this addition was 
taking place without a subsequent cut 
elsewhere in the budget, it was also met 
with some opposition.

“We [went] through every line item 
of last year’s budget with this year’s 
budget, and last year, External Affairs 
under-spent [their allocated funds] 
while Concerts and Events spent every 
penny,” Wing said during the A.S. 
Council meeting.

Once the rest of the budget met 
no conflicts, A.S. Council decided 
to give the External Affairs office its 
contingency fund.

excellence.”

According to the UC Regents’ 
policy on appointment of chancellors, 
the five faculty members on the 
committee are required to submit no 
less than five potential candidates to 
the committee for its consideration. 

During the process, the other 
members of the committee are 
allowed to consider and suggest other 
names, in addition to interviewing 
candidates. 

After the committee has completed 
its evaluations and advised Yudof in 
his final selection, he will submit his 
recommendation for Chancellor Fox’s 
replacement to the UC Regents.

“As Marye Anne Fox demonstrated 
in adding striking breadth and depth 
to the university’s already sterling 

reputation, strong leadership is 
essential to quality,” Yudof said in an 
Oct. 14 UCOP press release.

Yudof is aiming to have the next 
UCSD chancellor selected by May 
2012, in order to present his choice at 
the Board of Regents meeting.

Chancellor Fox is stepping down 
in June 2012 to return to teaching 
and researching as a distinguished 
professor of chemistry at UCSD.

Committee members include:
▶ UC Regents Dr. William de la Peña, 
Eddie Island, George Kieffer, Bonnie 
Reiss and Charlene Zettel
▶ Robert Anderson, chair of the UC 
Academic Council and UC Berkeley 
professor of economics and math

A series of foolish economic and political mis-steps has led the Californian educational system — including the San Diego Unified 
School District — to the edge of a precipice. 

It’s not just teaching jobs and art enrichment 
programs that are at stake; if the school districts 
don’t get their act together come December, the 
financial stability of the state could cave under bil-
lions of dollars in deficit. 

The problems here are many. Let us count the 
ways.

One. Over the last four years, the state’s edu-
cation system has seen $15 billion worth of cuts 
in education, forcing school administrations to 
scramble to patch up the gaps. SDUSD alone has 

endured a $450 million budget cut since 2007-08. 
The impact — a 15 percent reduction in faculty 
and support staff — has been felt throughout the 
district. 

Two. More recently, Gov. Jerry Brown signed the 
state’s “balanced budget” in July that predicted a $2 
billion revenue windfall that was unlikely to hap-
pen. Months later, it has become readily apparent 
that this $2 billion windfall will not be met come 
December, a scenario that would trigger $1.5 bil-
lion in education cuts statewide — $30 million for 
SDUSD alone. 

Three. One proposed solution is to shorten the 

For years, the most desperate desire of my materialist heart was to own an iPhone. And 
now, one AT&T contract after hav-
ing this wish fulfilled, I can finally 
face the truth. 

It was all a waste. I was never 
meant to have a smartphone.

Truth is, I’m not a tech-savvy 
user with a brain that runs like an 
RSS feed and eyes that process the 
world through an Instagram lens. 
I have a grand total of five unique 
apps, and none of them include 
Angry Birds — though I’m sure 
someone out there finds my audio 
Mandarin dictionary just as intrigu-
ing. 

The mail feature is defunct 
because I hate becoming anxious 
over new messages that turn out 
to be from coworkers asking about 
Friday’s pizza order. I’ve purpose-
fully made Safari difficult to access. 
I have no videos. Worst of all, I’m 
scared of Foursquare and won’t let 
my phone know where I am, or 
allow my friends to check me into 
“Places” on Facebook. 

Last night, it took me two hours, 
three attempts and five occurrences 
of force-quitting iTunes to download 
the new iPhone 5 software — and 
afterward, it looked like all I had to 
show were Newsstand and Reminder 
features. But, according to Roberto 
Baldwin of Wired, the upgrade does 
have an important, invisible compo-
nent: enhanced location services. 

“Location services” denotes the 
GPS-based technology that allows 
the Maps function to know your 
exact location and the Nike+ app to 
track the length of a run. With the 
new iOS, apps like the aforemen-
tioned Foursquare and Reminders 
will let users know via notifications 
when there’s something interesting 
nearby, be it a historical landmark or 
a four-star restaurant. 

It’ll show us tailored bits of eso-
terica we might otherwise miss. It’ll 
make us become more integrated 
with our environment. And, says 
Baldwin, it’ll also “allow us to be 
stalked like never before.”

Therein lies the dilemma. 
This self-proclaimed privacy 

freak is no stranger to the crime 
of overshare (just ask my seventh-
grade Xanga), but in recent years 
I’ve become increasingly obsessed 
with Web and location privacy. 
We’ve all heard the “Facebook is Big 
Brother” spiel and tired 1984 refer-
ences. 

There’s research galore about 
the harm of obsessively curating 
online personas and the effects of 
being watched. For example, a study 
covered by Scientific American 
showed that people cleaned up after 
themselves more when there was a 
poster with an image of human eyes 
nearby. And if you thought that the 
data doesn’t add up, there’s even a 
2010 documentary, “Erasing David,” 
about a British man who tries to 
disappear off the grid. Predictably, 
his trackers use his online and loca-
tion information — what David calls

When the first Tea Party protests emerged in early 2009, the movement 
asserted a libertarian strain of con-
servatism that had, in the previous 
decade, been overshadowed by other 
ideological strains manifested in cul-
ture war rhetoric and neoconserva-
tive foreign policy. 

Having this libertarian orienta-
tion, the Tea Party’s protest of the 
Wall Street bailouts included a 
critique of crony capitalism that 
resonated with the broader public 
and even resembled criticisms posed 
from the Left about corporatist eco-
nomic structures.    

Exactly how and when the Tea 
Party made its original critique is as 
important as the critique itself.  The 
movement asserted its interpretation 
of the economic crisis in a moment 
when the public was searching for 
a narrative that would make sense 
of what the financial collapse meant 
and how it happened.  

Disenchanted with the 
Republican Party, the conserva-
tive base abandoned its tradi-
tional mouthpiece and became the 
first national group in the Great 
Recession era to express its economic 
resentments through the medium 
of street protest.  Not only did this 
ultimately result in historic victories 
for the Republican Party in the 2010 
midterm elections, it more impor-
tantly changed the national conversa-
tion and moved the ideological goal 
posts of American politics. In fact, all 

subsequent policy discussions deal-
ing with the downturn were argued 
within the Tea Party’s rigidly anti-
statist terms. 

 That is up until now.
 A new street protest move-

ment called Occupy Wall Street 
has emerged on the national stage 
to make the left-wing critique of 
the Great Recession that the for-
mal representatives of the political 
left have been unable or unwilling 
to make.  While the Occupy Wall 
Street Movement shares the Tea 
Party’s repudiation of the collusion 
between Wall Street and D.C., it 
targets the other side of the corporat-
ist coin, shedding light on aspects 
of the Recession the Tea Party has 
obscured, namely, the role the finan-
cial sector and corporate America 
played in causing the downturn and 
in amplifying economic inequality. 

As the Tea Party did in 2009, 
OWM is starting to shift the national 
conversation moving the discussion 
away from debt and spending toward 
taxes, regulation and political reform. 
Could this momentary shift lead 
to electoral and policy victories for 
the Left?  Will OWM “occupy” the 
Democratic Party? Or will it lead to 
the even greater political feat, a rever-
sal of the conservative interpretation 
of the Recession and the establish-
ment of a new common sense about 
the economy and its decline?

— Reece Peck

Communication

Both Occupy Wall Street and the other recent political movement of note, the Tea 
Party, represent grassroots popular 
discontent with the structure of the 
contemporary American political 
system. Each movement manifests 
features of populist anti-elitism. 
That is to say, each movement 
believes that elites run the show and 
that political institutions are walled 
off from the needs, desires and pref-
erences of ordinary Americans.

There the similarities mostly 
end. The movements represent a 
battle over fundamental political 
principles. The Tea Party believes 
that the federal government has 
grown too big and intrusive, has 
undermined free market capital-
ism and has compromised the 
individual’s ability to control his or 
her life. Occupy Wall Street holds 
that large corporations and espe-
cially the big financial institutions 
have ruined the economy, in part 
because their risky and greedy prac-
tices were not properly regulated 
by government oversight. Put very 
simply, for the Tea Party the bad 
guy is the profligate federal govern-
ment; for Occupy Wall Street the 
villain is Wall Street – and its allies 
in Congress.

While this is a clash of fun-
damental political principles, the 
difference between the Tea Party 
and Occupy Wall Street can also be 
seen as a playing out of what the 
historian Richard Hofstadter called 

“status anxiety.”  The Tea Party 
looks to the past and some nostal-
gic hankering for the glory days of 
American life – which is revealed in 
the demographics of Tea Party sup-
porters, who are overwhelmingly 
white, evangelical Protestant, older 
and wealthier than most Americans. 
When Tea Partiers cry, “We want 
our country back!” it can only be 
for the restoration of their authority 
in politics and the culture. Occupy 
Wall Street reveals status anxiety, 
but about an uncertain, perhaps 
damaged future – also revealed in 
the demographics of its support-
ers, who are largely young people 
with debts, no jobs and perhaps no 
prospects.

One small observation about 
communication and politics: 
Notwithstanding all of the hoopla 
about social media, it is interesting 
that it is the old-fashioned face-to-
face protest march and rally that 
galvanize political commitment and 
command attention. And notwith-
standing the remarkable organizing 
capabilities of social media, what 
did Occupy Wall Street do after a 
couple of weeks of interacting in 
New York’s Zuccotti Park?  They 
put out a newspaper. Why? — 
Because a newspaper conveys a 
sense of place and the experience of 
being part of an actual social move-
ment in formation.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  MONDAY, OCTOBER 17,  2011 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG 5

CROSSHATCHED By Samantha Sligh

“datarape” — to find him after 18 days. 
So when even the illusion of being watched is enough 

to modify behavior and most of us are never truly alone, 
what’s a girl to do?

I’ll be the first to admit that, ironically, I need loca-
tion-based services more than anyone I know. As some-
one who only recently took the “student driver” sign 
off her car — nearly three years after getting her license 
— I’d probably be stuck moving within a radius of 10 
miles if it weren’t for the wonders of my in-car GPS. 

Luddite streak aside, I do sometimes want everyone 
to know that I’m blowing $50 on an entreé at Whisk n’ 
Ladle. And yes, I realize the silliness and logical incon-
sistency of avoiding this particular type of technology.

It’s not that I think that the government is track-
ing my movements, or that anyone cares that I don’t go 
out on Friday nights but instead sit at my desk doing 
LTRU123 readings.  But my desire to be able to be truly 

alone, without anyone watching or able to find me, and 
thus for my life to be truly my own and not under scru-
tiny, has always been stronger than my thirst for novelty 
or convenience. 

So for the time being, I’ll continue disabling loca-
tion services and notifications and, rather hypocritically, 
using my in-car GPS instead of the one on my phone 
— though I know there’s not much difference from “the 
man” knowing where my car is versus “the man” know-
ing where I am. 

I’ll continue looking up restaurants by “near San 
Diego” instead of “nearby” and resisting the urge to brag 
during the rare occurrence I actually go somewhere. 

Sometime soon, I’ll either learn that Apple is tracking 
me regardless and then turn full-heartedly to location 
services, or location services will become so integrated 
that I can’t do without. 

But until then, it’s — for as long as I can stand it 
— me, myself and I. And someone in the passenger seat 
to help me check where I’m going. 

school year by seven full days. 
However, the school year has 
already been reduced by five days 
due to budget cuts last year. Cutting 
the school year by another seven 
days is impossible for nearly half 
of California schools, including 
SDUSD, because of closed teaching 
unions.

Four. But in spite of these dire 
consequences, the school board has 
managed to make its situation even 
more alarming. Despite the fact that 
employee compensation already 
makes up 90 percent of the school 
district’s budget, the board still 
managed to grant across the board 
7.2 percent raises for the 2012-13 
school year. 

Another set of 3.8 percent raises 
— based on years on the job — is 
still quite in place. These raises, 
based on the idea that state-funded 
revenue would continue to rise year 
by year, are part of an outdated 
practice that will contribute to bring 
down the school district. 

Teachers and their unions argue 
that they have sacrificed enough 
over the past few years — that cuts 
should be made elsewhere. And 
though that may be true, the fact 
of the matter remains that SDUSD 
— and every school district across 
the state — must make concessions 

across the board. 
Teachers are undoubtedly impor-

tant, but a financially stable school 
is equally, if not more important. 

Due to such strict union laws, 
schools may be left with the rather 
savory option of trimming costs in 
other places. This might require lay-
ing off custodians, cafeteria workers 
and other essential support staff, an 
option that may have dire conse-
quences for the school district.

Asking union members to forgo 
raises is a feasible solution, if only 
temporary, option. 

Financially solvent solutions 
are few and far between, and the 
clock is ticking towards a worst-case 
scenario of a $100 million dollar 
projected deficit in the 2012-13 
school year, according to SDUSD 
Superintendent Bill Kowba. 

Even without the mid-year bud-
get cut, the district is looking at a 
$30 million dollar budget gap. 

Solving this potential catastrophe 
will take far more than petitions to 
the governor or pointing fingers. 

The school board, the com-
munity and teacher unions alike 
must face the reality of the long 
road ahead and make concessions 
accordingly.

The Worlds a Classroom
THE GUARDIAN GUIDE TO STUDYING ABROAD

BEFORE YOU GO DESTINATIONS
Santiago, Chile

As a study abroad destination, Chile 
is often overlooked in favor of more 
touristy Latin American countries 
(Argentina, Brazil), but dont be fooled 
by its relative obscurity: The nation is a 
gem of colorful culture and the image of 
a modernizing Latin America. �

Chile-bound students will likely opt 
for the dense capital of Santiago, where 
over a third of the countrys population 
resides. City life, like the dizzying speed 
at which Chileans speak, whizzes by. �

However, political turmoil is not 
absent from the country. The younger 
generation has been protesting since 
mid-June for free public education  a 
policy which had been the norm before 
the oppressive 17-year dictatorship of 
General Augusto Pinochet.

Ive had the unexpected opportunity 
to study at both the public Universidad 
de Chile and the private Pontificia 
Universidad Católica (PUC). �The stu-
dent strikes made it impossible to con-
tinue at la Universidad de Chile for the second semester, so I elected to switch. �Both experi-
ences were widely different. Bureaucracy is more ordered at PUC, while the students are more 
socioeconomically diverse in la Universidad de Chile. �

And while the countrys ethnically homogeneous demography can sometimes make life 
as an exchange student a bit trying, its interesting to experience the cultural differences. At 
the beginning, it was hard to navigate the breakneck, slurred espaæol chileno and construct a 
whole new life, but weeks, then months went by and I found myself spitting colloquial phrases 
like the rest and running around the city into the wee hours of the morning. �

credits. Galvin said, explaining that 
the credits are automatically added to a 
students transcript through EAP. With 
EAP students who receive financial aid 
can use state, federal, UCSD institutional 
aid towards their EAP program

The Opportunities Abroad Program 
(OAP) picks up what EAP misses. As 
a network of study abroad programs 
around the world, it offers a larger num-
ber of destination options and types of 
programs, including internship and vol-
unteer opportunities.

OAP credits are considered transfer 
credits, meaning a student who wants 
to go to graduate school has to take the 
extra step of combining and submitting 
their regular transcript grades and a 
separate study abroad transcript. OAP 
also accepts federal and state financial 
aid, but not UCSD grants.

For a closer, more unique experience, 
there is also the Global Seminars. The 
increasingly popular program  which 
started in 2008  takes about 15 to 28 
students who work closely with a profes-
sor for a total of eight weeks, earning 
eight UC credits while completing rigor-
ous coursework.

The students make a really strong 
connection with the UCSD professor 
who can become a mentor too upon 
their return to campus and that profes-
sor can make letters of recommendation 
for graduate or professional school, 

Galvin said.
Through the PAO, approximately 

1300 students study abroad. But as 
Galvin mentions, students also have the 
option of Alternative Breaks, a service 
project that takes students abroad dur-
ing academic breaks to complete service 
projects in developing countries, as well 
as separate departmental programs.

With the PAOs new model, advisers 
are taking even greater care to make sure 
traveling students waste no time in get-
ting their degree.

Instead of asking the students where 
do you want to study abroad we will first 
ask what would you like to study abroad, 
what academic subjects are your focus 
when you go abroad, Galvin said. Were 
really focusing on a tighter integration 
with our advising and the overall aca-
demic mission of the university.

To make any abroad experience 
worthwhile, Galvin suggests that stu-
dents work very closely with the PAO 
office prior to departure, and even dur-
ing their trip. A student having issues 
during their time abroad can also email, 
call or even Skype the PAO office to find 
solutions.

To start your globe-trotting excur-
sion, make sure to visit the PAO office, 
or the Programs Abroad EXPO 2011, 
taking place on the Oct. 17 at the 
International Center.

Beijing, China
There are, invariably, three rites of passage for the foreigner who studies abroad in Beijing: 

getting cheated while haggling, getting diarrhea and getting thousand-year history shoved 
down your throat.

Dont get me wrong. Beijing is the cultural capital of China, a global, political and eco-
nomic powerhouse chock full of cheap, if low-quality, merchandise �but none of these will 
protect the timid student who cowers in the face of over-persistent saleswomen. Or the coed 
who couldnt resist the sizzling street kabobs and ends up in the bathroom for six hours.

But for the student undaunted by extreme weather and overcrowding, Beijing as a study 
abroad destination offers an affordable, fascinating mix of modern and historical features, and 
�if youre into that kind of thing  more culture shock than Western Europe can offer.

Unlike the more metropolitan and Westernized Shanghai, Beijing is famed worldwide 
for its postcard (or profile pic)-worthy landmarks, from the historical (the centuries-old 
Forbidden City) and political (Tiananmen Square, home to the 1989 protests) to the religious 
(Llama and Confucian Temples), architectural (Birds Nest stadium) and iconic (Great Wall). 

Beijing is downright cheap and international students are usually treated well by their 
See BEIJING page 7

Barcelona, Spain
World-famous for its hedonism, Barcelona will happily claim your savings, your dignity 

and likely your heart on a trip abroad. This city isnt cheap by any measure: hard as you might 
try to get by on tapas (Spanish appetizers) and liquor store-grade sangria, pricier pastures will 
always beckon, as theres no shortage of enticing bars and restaurants. Barcelona gets a bad rap 
for its pick-pocketers, but exercising common sense should be enough to keep your purse safe. 

Classes themselves vary by program (there are three major universities within city limits, 
and several smaller schools), though you can generally expect smooth sailing. Instructors are 
mindful of the fact that you havent come 7,000 miles from home for another 8 a.m. lecture, 
and youll more often than not have plenty of downtime to explore. 

Youll need it: the list of museums, clubs (excuse me: discotecas), and stunning feats of 
architectural genius is apparently endless. Highlights include the Miró Museum atop Montjuic, 
as well as Razzmatazz, an affordable nightclub thats geared toward a younger, alternative clien-
tele. Whatever you do, dont just take a few snapshots of Gaudís Sagrada Familia and call it a 
trip: in Barcelona, the study is silent in study abroad.

Anyone can tell you that Berlin’s one of a kind when it comes to fash-
ion, art and certainly history, but what they might forget to mention is a 
student’s godsend: it doesn’t get much cheaper on this side of the Atlantic. 
Two-Euro pizza and two-for-one drinks aren’t a bad place to start, but if 
you’re planning on extending your stay, 400 Euros a month buys you a one-
bedroom apartment in the hippest part of town, Mitte. (Anyone who’s ever 
trolled Craigslist for a Costa Verde sublet understands the sheer magic of 
that price point). 

As for the classes themselves, be aware that Berlin’s largest college (and 

EAP partner), the Free University of Berlin, is situated a 30- to 45-minute 
train ride from the city center. Nevertheless, navigating Berlin — a behe-
moth of a modern city, at eight times the size of Paris — should prove to be 
a cinch. Between the subway (U-bahn), above-ground train (S-bahn) and 
bus systems, a visit to any of the city’s myriad attractions is seldom more 
than a short ride away. You’ll want to explore by the TV Tower and certainly 
the East Side Gallery (a colorful memorial to the Berlin Wall). But taking in 
the nightlife at legendary clubs like Berghain — a converted warehouse that 
doesn’t let the party stop ‘til well past sunrise — is truly the stuff of study 
abroad legend.

respective institutions. At Beijing 
Normal University, local students are 
stuffed four or six to a room, while 
UC students share doubles with 
private bathrooms and, most crucial 
during the humid summer, air condi-
tioning. 

Most people come to Beijing 
specifically to study Mandarin; lucky 
for them, the professors’ expecta-
tions of foreigners are so low that the 
classes are usually guaranteed easy As. 
Outside of the classroom, a surprising 
number of locals and service work-
ers (waiters, etc) are unable to speak 
English, so there’s plenty of opportu-
nity for practice and hilarious misun-
derstandings.

Aside from being the seat of 
government and media, Beijing is 
also one of the world’s culture head-
quarters. The student who heads to 
the Northern City (as the city’s name 
literally translates) shouldn’t forget 
to check out the free 798 art district, 
abundant concerts and, if she’s lucky, 
the spectacle of locals convening to 
dance every night under various land-
marks.

Florence, Italy
To Americans, Florence is a gold mine of art history and architecture, a 

foodie’s wet dream and the perfect starting point for exploring Italia.
To Italians, Florence is the city ruined by tourism.
American students flock there each semester to gawk at Michelangelo’s 

David, climb to the top of Brunelleschi’s Duomo or admire the gold-thread-
ed Botticelli paintings in the Uffizi. Still others are content to sit on the 
banks of the Arno eating “authentic” gelato or paninis. 

But they do all that in a city almost completely devoid of Italians. The 
influx of foreigners, and the sky-high cost of living, has driven them all 
away; the only natives left in the city are restaurant and hostel workers. 

But if your heart is set on living in Dante and Da Vinci’s hometown, then 
do Florence right. The Oltrarno district (across the river) remains an Italian 
holdout. Take the time to actually visit Florence’s museums and order from 
a café where the waiters say “ciao” when you walk in the door. And you can’t 
beat Florence’s central location for exploring the rest of Italy; all the north-
south trains go through the capital of Tuscany. You have easy public trans-
port from Firenze to Rome, Venice, Cinque Terre, Bologna and the nature-
friendly Tuscan hiking destinations besides.

The Univer

will pay back
 $38 million

 in fees to 

students in

after a San Fr

judge ruled 
on March 1

0 that the 

university h
ad raised fe

es illegally 

from 2003 to
 2007.

According t

— Andrea 

Luquetta et. al v
. Regents of the 

University of Cali
fornia — official 

university do
cuments, inc

luding an 

online fee g
uide, stated

 that fees 

would not be
 increased fo

r continu-

ing students 
at any point 

throughout 

their period 
of enrollmen

t. 

The court ru
led that thes

e mate-

the universit

ed.

“The contrac

included a bi
nding comm

itment not 

to raise the

for continui

” Superior 

Court Judge
 John Munte

r said in a 

statement.
The ruling 

applies to 
nearly 

3,000 studen

Danielle Le

, said that 

while fee

must be info

possibility 

of such incre

ey go into

 case, studen

“The court 

concluded t
hat the

SHOULD THE

THE GROVE

THE END
By Regina Ip

Associate News E
ditor

A week after
 A.S. Counci

l first 

met to appoi
nt the 2010-1

1 associ-

ate vice presid
ents, one of t

he three 

remaining pos
itions is still un

filled — 

leaving the co
uncil to enter 

next year 

without a full
 cabinet of 10

 AVPs in 

charge of ma
naging variou

s aspects 

of student life
. 

On May 26, 
the council v

oted 

against appoin
ting A.S. Presid

ent Wafa 

Ben Hassine’s 
nominations f

or three 

AVP position
s. The nomin

ations of 

former Campu
swide Senator

 Desiree 

Prevo for the A
VP of Academ

ic Affairs 

position, and 
former AVP 

of Local 

Affairs Aries 
Yumul for the

 AVP of 

College Affair
s position we

re voted 

down, while
 the nomin

ation of 

Eleanor Roose
velt College so

phomore 

Arohi Sharma
 for the AVP o

f Student 

Advocacy posi
tion was tabled

. 

On June 3, th
e council app

roved 

Prevo and Sha
rma to tempo

rarily fill 

the Academic
 Affairs and 

Student 

Advocacy po
sitions, resp

ectively. 

They will car
ry out the AV

P posi-

tions until We
ek Four of Fal

l Quarter 

at which poin
t applications

 for the 

position will r
eopen. 

The position 
of AVP of Co

llege 

Affairs was no
t discussed an

d will not 

be filled until 
Fall Quarter. 

According to
 Ben Hassin

e, all 

three position
s were tabled

 at the 

Campus Affai
rs committee 

meeting, 

which is held
 prior to the

 council 

meeting. From
 that, the Ac

ademic 

Affairs and S
tudent Advoc

acy posi-

tions were pul
led out of com

mittee to 

be discussed a
t the meeting.

 

Ben Hassine 
said the posi

tions 

were tabled —
 and then vot

ed down 

—  because 
councilmemb

ers dis-

agreed with th
e process of c

hoosing 

members for 
the selection 

commit-

tee. The select
ion committee

 consists 

of the preside
nt, the outgo

ing AVP 

and three to fo
ur council sena

tors.

See AVP,�page 7

In less th
an two hours 

last night, the
 A.S. Council

 voted 17-2 to
 

shut down the
 Grove Cafe, e

ffectively endi
ng a 24-year s

aga that 

included num
erous attempt

s to revitalize 
the struggling

 eatery. 

The decision c
omes a year af

ter the previou
s council voted

 last June 

to continue op
erating the co

ffee shop, whi
ch was $140,0

00 in debt at 

the time. How
ever, despite o

ngoing renova
tions and a m

uch-hyped 

reopening this
 Winter Quart

er, the busines
s has increased

 its debt over 

$35,000, to a t
otal of nearly 

$180,000. 

According to
 both Vice P

resident of F
inance and R

esources 

Andrew Ang 
and Associate

 Vice Presiden
t of Enterpris

e Operations 

Brian McEuen
, the Grove wo

uld need to m

Over 11,000

five

United annou
nced last Frida

“One of the th
ings we’ve bee

n ask-

ing is that the 
[nurse-to-pati

ent] ratio 

should be ma
intained at al

l times,” 

UCSD Medica
l Center - Hill

crest reg-

istered nurse J
anice Webb sa

id. “We’re 

asking for brea
k-relief nurses

. That’s a 

nurse that com
es in and watc

hes your 

patient while y
ou’re on break

.”

The protest, sl
ated to be the l

argest 

nurse strike in
 U.S. history, 

will also 

include an ad
ditional 14,00

0 nurs-

es from Calif
ornia and M

innesota, 

totaling 25,00
0 participants

.

California law
 requires hos

pitals 

to maintain 
at least one 

nurse for 

every three to
 five patients,

 depend-

ing on the ca
re the patient

s receive. 

The union sa
id it wants to

 mandate 

stronger enfo
rcement of th

ese laws 

and establish s
afe ratios at al

l times. 

According to 
Webb, the me

dical 

centers do not
 have enough 

nurses to 

attend the pat
ients.

 “We’ve been
 having mee

tings 

with hospitals
 that say they

 already 

have charge 
nurses, but r

ealistical-

ly they can’t 
maintain the 

ratio on 

breaks,” she sa
id. “A lot of tim

es when 

the charge n
urses [or nu

rses who 

supervise] wa
tch, there are 

still more

eone to

However, in a

n online state
ment, 

the UC Office
 of the Presid

ent con-

tended that s
uch a strike i

s without 

legitimate cau

“The univers

clear violation
 of the parti

tract,” UCOP 
said in their st

The strike w
ill also attem

to make sure

ustry can easi

ly rescind

“The other th

b said. “Thing

Students from 50 states and 90 countries congregated on 
campus for the Clinton Global Initiative University this week-
end, held April 1 to 3. �e conference is devoted to developing 
and implementing projects (called “commitments”) to global 
issues, such as poverty, pollution, LGBT rights and college af-
fordability.  

About 1,200 students entered the conference with individ-
ual commitments, 200 of which were from UCSD.  Students 
were required to apply to be participate.

�e Clinton Global Initiative is part of the Clinton Foun-
dation, founded by former U.S. president Bill Clinton in 2005.  
Now hosting its fourth conference, the CGIU has been to uni-
versities in New Orleans, Texas and Miami.  

Clinton was on hand for the weekend’s event, and other 
guests included Qualcomm CEO Paul Jacobs, actor Sean Penn 
and singer Mandy Moore.  Jacobs participated in the opening 
session, while Moore spoke at the �rst workshop on global 
health and Penn appeared at the closing session. Students were 
also able to attend a variety of panels and workshops to prepare 
them to ful�ll their commitment to face issues such as popula-
tion growth, the environment and global health.

“You believe you can make a di�erence, and we’re going 
to help you,” Clinton said at the April 1 opening session. “�e 
most important question is ‘how do you propose to do it [com-
mitment]’ and college students are more prone for that ques-
tion.”

CGI U Campus Representative Melissa Etehad, who at-
tended CGI U in Miami last year, expressed her excitement 
over the event’s international scope.

“It’s an international event for UCSD, and imagine 200 stu-
dents changing the world,” Etehad said. “I am so excited for the

Carlsbad resident Julio Angel Garcia-Puente, 50, 
will go to trial for murder and arson charges following 
a hearing held March 30. He is suspected of killing his 
estranged wife — 38-year-old Lorena Gonzalez, whose 
body was found in a burning vehicle in the P701 
parking lot next to the UCSD baseball field.

At the preliminary hearing to determine if probable 
cause exists to indict Garcia-Puente, San Diego 

Superior Court Judge Jeffrey Fraser 
concluded that the prosecutors 
provided sufficient evidence for the 
case to stand trial, the San Diego 
Union-Tribune reported on March 
30.

San Diego firefighters testified 
that they arrived in the parking lot 

at approximately 8:30 p.m., when they 
found the vehicle in flames. According to the Union-
Tribune, firefighter Justin Price said that when he 
opened one of the car doors, he saw a head and an 
arm. Investigators determined that the vehicle was 
intentionally set on fire.

According to the Union-Tribune, deputy district 
attorney Nicole Rooney testified that Gonzalez died 
of strangulation, as three bones in her neck were

A
fter five months of planning, A.S. Concerts and Events 
Media Liaison Oliver Zhang sat down with the Guardian 
Sunday afternoon to leak the lineup for the annual Sun 
God Festival.

“For me, it’s the best lineup we’ve ever had,” Zhang said of the 
May 13 festival. 

Rapper Wiz Khalifa will be headlining the main stage, while 
Jesse F. Keeler (JFK) of electronic music duo MSTRKRFT will be 
the main act at the dance tent. 

Best Coast, Mike Posner, Jimmy Eat World and Crystal Castles 
will also play the main stage. The support for the dance tent — as 

well as one more act for the main stage — will be revealed once 
the artist contracts are completed.

“Not all contracts are fully executed,” Zhang said. “When we 
release something we want to make sure that the contracts are 
fully valid, just in case they back out at the last minute.”

Associate Vice President of Concerts and Events Brian Wong 
said he is proud of the lineup.

“We knew coming into this year that it would be hard to top 
the success of 2010,” he said in an email. “To make this year’s

“Fiercely independent” student radio station KSDT has given up on plans to obtain an FM frequency. Station managers are now looking to build a radio tower to pursue an AM frequency instead.KSDT station co-manager Meredith Wong said that the AM tower would cost approximately $100,000 and that she hoped it could be located in a central area of campus — although she was unsure where that would be. 

“We’re really serious about it, but we haven’t started much of the research,” Wong said.

Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger presented his revised 2010-11 state budget last week, a plan that includes a new round of fund-ing increases for public colleges, but that suggests cutting $3.7 bil-

lion from health-care services that impact low-income families who depend on state welfare programs. The suggested allocations to the University of California are nearly identical to the ones from Schwarzenegger’s January propos-al, including the restoration of the $305 million cut last year and an additional $51.3 million in finan-cial aid toward the 5,121 eligible students in the system who are not currently being funded. However, the governor’s newest budget would negate his January proposal to cut $111.8 million set aside to 

accommodate growing enrollment  in the UC and CSU systems. In order to absorb California’s $19.1 billion budget deficit, other services would suffer major cuts — including a proposed $3.7 billion from in health care, that would cut the Medi-Cal program for the poor, along with state in-home support for the disabled. In addi-tion, the budget takes into account Proposition 98 — which passed in 1988 and guarantees a minimum pool of money for schools. Under

T his year’s Sun God Festival — with acts like B.o.B, Relient K, Michelle Branch and headliner Drake — attracted a packed house on May 14. For the second time in Sun God history, all 16,500 student wristbands and 3,500 guest tickets sold out.      In 2008, the first time this happened, tickets didn’t sell out until the day before. This year, all tickets sold out by 2:30 p.m. on Friday, at which time students were turned away.According to Associate Vice President of Concerts and Events Alex Bramwell — who organized this year’s Sun God Festival — the sell-out was due to the popularity of the event’s leading acts.
“We get complaints and yelled at when stu-dents can’t bring their guests, but at the same time, we get yelled at and complaints when the 

students can’t bring themselves — so finding a good balance between those two is tough,” Bramwell said. “We had the same numbers as last year. It just turned out this year to be more popular of an event; more students wanted to come.”
At the 2008 Sun God Festival — when students wristbands were distributed for the entire week leading up to the event — tickets ran out on Thursday, leading students to pur-chase all the leftover guest tickets for them-selves that Friday. 

In 2009, students waited in line for up to four hours on the morning of the festival to receive their wristbands. Despite the crowds, however, over 1,000 of last year’s wristbands went unclaimed.

and pains, the strained breathing, the 
tendinitis and twisted ankles  is rec-
onciled for some by the sheer enjoy-
ment of the endeavor, and for others 
by the gratification of accomplishment. 
� � �  This years womens cross country 
squad saw an overhaul in personnel, 
with head coach Ronald Garcia bring-
ing in a number of new runners. But 
Kobayashi says the youth has brought 
with it a renewed competition within 
the squad, keeping the senior run-
ners on their toes as the newcom-
ers push to claim spots of their own. 
� � �  Within the squad, an odd balance 
between competitiveness and cama-
raderie needs to be struck. With only 
10 runners allowed to travel with the 
team, and nearly twice that amount 
on the roster, runners are always look-
ing to beat the guy in front of them. 
Lenahan and Kobayashi agree that 
its enjoyable to run with the pack, 

but that at the end of the day, every-
ones accountable for themselves. 
� � �  Probably because of the intensity of 

the event, cross 
country run-
ners, more than 
any other set of 
collegiate ath-
letes, are argu-
ably the most 
rigid about 
taking care of 
their bodies. In 
soccer, basket-
ball, water polo 
or golf, a bad 
performance 

can be written off by the difficulty of 
the course, bad weather, poor referee-
ing, etc. But in cross country, theres no 
getting around the numbers. You either 
ran well, or you didnt  and in either 
case, the fault lies with the runner alone. 
� � �  Once a year, the runners con-

sult with a staff nutritionist, mak-
ing sure that they get enough calo-
ries in to maintain their weight. 
� � �  And unlike other sports, because 
a lot of UCSDs cross country ath-
letes run for track as well, there 
is no off season. The push to 
improve is a year-round struggle. 
��� I ended a brief phone interview with 
Lenehan by asking the two time letter 
winner what kinds of goals the team has 
at the end of the season for themselves. 
��� His answers had been brief through-
out, but Lenehan curtly replied, The 
goal is always to win the race, after 
which I thought I had been dismissed 
as ignorant and that the conversation 
was over. He went on to add that the 
team is also always looking to qualify 
for nationals and improve individu-
ally, but his first statement sums it up. 
� � � At the end of the day, cross country 
is a bottom line, and everyones just 
racing to the top.

at 7-6.
Starting the fourth quarter down 

by one, the Tritons slipped early and 
the Gauchos got a goal within the 
first two minutes. UCSD fought back 
halfway through the quarter, pulling 
to within one again after sophomore 
Josh Stiling put away a cross-pool 
pass from William Brown. 

But the Gauchos widened the 
gap, scoring another goal with 1:53 
remaining.

Still down by two, senior Graham 
Saber scored coming out of a time-
out with thirty seconds left to play, 
bringing the score to 9-8. 

Despite the support of a large 
UCSD crowd, the Gauchos were able 
to maintain possession for the last 
thirty seconds and landed another 
goal to take the 10-8 victory. The 
Tritons have dropped three straight 
matches since the SoCal Tournament 
two weeks ago. 

UCSD will look to beat the 
slump on Friday against rival Loyola 
Marymount on Friday, Oct. 21. The 
Tritons have split games against 
Loyola Maryount so far this season 
and have outscored them by two 
goals.

The womens volleyball team is 
now on a three-game winning streak 
after beating San Francisco State and 
Cal Poly Pomona this past weekend 
on their Northern California road trip. 
Coming off of a three-game slump, the 
No. 18 Tritons rebounded beautifully 
last Friday against middle-of-the-pack 
squad San Francisco State. 

Senior outside hitter Hillary 
Williamson played arguably one of the 
best games of her career, setting career 
records for her 24 kills, as well as a 
career best for 17 digs and two blocks to 
total 25 points against the Gators. 

Senior outside hitter Roxanne 
Brunsting also recorded a career best of 
37 assists to lead the team to a deserved 
3-2 win over San Francisco.

UCSDs senior outside hitter Katie 
Condon finished with eight kills in the 
campaign, along with freshman and 
junior middle blockers, Lauren Demos 
and Julia Freidenberg.

 Condon pulled off three critical 
service aces and had 17 digs, while 
senior libero Janessa Werhane totaled 
an outstanding 27 digs.

Sara Kurfess led all players with 30 
digs.

In the final set, UCSD went ahead 
10-6, but then found itself 12-11 when 

SFSU scored six of the next seven 
points. A kill by Williamson, in combi-
nation with an SFSU error and a kill by 
Condon, sealed the set for the Tritons, 
as well as the match.

It was a very intense match, UCSD 
head coach Ricci Luyties said. It was 
another great example of how we can 
beat good teams on the road. We played 
a tough match and had to overcome 
things like a vocal crowd to come out 
on top.

With the win, the team improved to 
12-4 overall and 8-4 in the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association, while 
San Francisco State fell to 10-8 overall 
and 6-7 in the CCAA.

We battled hard and it was a nice 
win for us, Luyties said. We showed 
several times that we can be resilient 
and come back when were down. To 
do that on the road is a real confidence 
boost.

The Tritons carried the momentum 
from their last match into a 3-1 vic-
tory Saturday against Cal Poly Pomona. 
UCSD came out strong, taking con-
trol of the first two sets with scores 
of 25-19 and 25-17. But the Broncos 
came back to take the third set, 
25-16, when the Tritons recorded 
their lowest attack percentage of the 
match at .024. The Tritons closed out 
with a 25-20 win in the fourth set.

Its been a rough week for the UCSD mens 
water polo team. After taking ninth place last 
week in the Long Beach SoCal tournament, 
defeating long time rival, Loyola Marymount 
University and soaring to a No. 9 overall 

national ranking, the Tritons have since lost 
some very close games to good opponents. 

Despite staying close to home, with a 
home game and a road trip to Long Beach, 
the mens team dropped two straight games to 
No. 12 Cal State Long Beach and No. 5 UCSB. 
The Tritons have lost three consecutive games 
since attaining their ninth place rank  their 
highest ranking of the season.

On the road Wednesday at Cal State Long 
Beach, the Tritons and 49ers went back and 
forth through the entire game, with neither 
team taking a lead larger than two for more 

than a minute. 
The 49ers jumped ahead early, taking a 

quick three-point lead in the first quarter, 
but the Tritons  led by junior utility Brain 
Donohoes two goals  fought back, nar-
rowing the difference before much time had 
passed. 

By the end of the first eight minutes, the 
two teams had scored nine goals collectively. 
But after the first quarter, the offense dried 
up. Both teams scored a goal each in the next 
two quarters, but neither team could capital-
ize on the five ejections. 

Locked in a one-point game, the two 
teams fought for the advantage in the fourth 
period.

The Triton defense continued to shut 
down the 49er attack, while the offense for 
UCSD found the back of the net twice in the 
first four minutes. 

It seemed like UCSD was going to sneak 
away with another comeback victory, but with 
less than 10 seconds left, the 49ers scored to 
tie the game and sent it into overtime.

� � �  Cal State Long Beach scored a minute 
into the extra period and despite an offensive 
push to the goal, the Tritons were not able to 
find the net. 

The loss counts as the Tritons first defeat 
in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation 
match for the season.

On Saturday, the Tritons looked to upset, 
as they hosted No. 5 UCSB. 

Despite the narrow defeat in Long Beach 
earlier in the week, the Tritons came out 
strong and with less than three minutes to 
play, were one goal away from the home 
upset. They were unable to pull it together 
in the end. 

The Gauchos took a 2-1 lead in the first 
quarter and extended that lead in the second 
quarter, 4-2. 

The Tritons fought their way back to pull 
within one by the end of the third quarter. A 
huge penalty save from senior David Morton 
helped to keep the game close, with the score 

See M. WATER POLO,Êpage 11

To me, running is an activity akin to eating vegetables or getting your wisdom teeth pulled. Most people 
dont enjoy it, but they do it to stay healthy. 
� � �  UCSDs cross country team is made up 

of the exceptions: those few that actual-
ly enjoy going on a 10 mile morning run. 
� � �  Six out of the seven days a week  
the NCAA regulation maximum amount of 
days a team is allowed to practice  the 
16 men and 20 women on the roster usu-
ally start their day well before 8 a.m.  
� � �  Practices begin at 7:20 a.m. on weekdays 
and 8 a.m. on weekends. The shortest runs, 
says junior captain Matt Lenehan, will usu-
ally be around five miles, but will only take 
the men around 35 minutes. Runners look to 
maintain their stamina, going on longer runs 
with the pack, and once or twice a week, will 
look to push themselves to work on their speed.  
� � �  Most of the time, outside of the different 
routes and the changes in scenery, practices are 
monotonous, and for most people, painfully so.  
� � �  But senior captain Aaryn Kobayashi says 
that the amount of physical punishment the 
runners endure on a daily basis  the aches
