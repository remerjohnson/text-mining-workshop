Tuition Ahead if Jarvis II Loses? 
, 

• BY CAROLYN FRIDAY 
s.aa.-nto CorrelpOftdent 

UC President" David Saxon told a 
Senate Finance subcommittee 
yesterday . during a hearing on 
Governor Brown's proposed 1980-81 
$965 million UC budget that tuition 
would probably be imposed if any 
substantial reductions are made.

the university plans to make up 2/3 of 
the reductions through tuition. 

support and the remaining two-thirds 
would be raised through tuition. 

According to Jim Knox, chairperson 
of the SBPC budget committee and 
one of the students consulted Ia.t week 
by UC President Tom Jenkins and 
Donald Swain, UC is now infonning 
the Department of Finance that a 30 

university expects to Iott 9,000 
students if they charged $2,000 
tuition, an additional $27 miIion would 
automatically be dropped from the 
faculty support that the state provides 
on a perl student basi •. 

"Because of the cuts of the past two 
y~ars, many of which this committee 
tried to restore, any substantial cuts 
below the level of the governor's 
budget would necessitate drastic and 
harmful reductions in university 
programs and would probably require, 
for the first time in the university's 
history the imposition of a general 
tuition," the president told the 
legislators. 

In planning for Jarvis II, the 
governor has requested from the heads 
of aU state agencies an itemized li.t of . 
how each agency would cope with a 30 
percent reduction from the governor's 

Knox said the students were told 
even if the university'. portion under 
Brown's contingency pJana amounted 
to 10 percent, or $96 rniHion, students 
would stiU shoulder 2/3 of the bwden in 
the fonn of a $600 tuition. 

In this case, the remaining 1/3 cuts 
would still come from various 
programs but in proportionally smaller 
amounts than under the 30 percent 
budget reductions. 

Legislative analyst William Hamm 
said last week in his annual budget 
recommendations to the legislature 
that $7.6 million should be shaved off 
the university's $965 million for 1980·

UCSD Search Front 
Everything's Quiet 

New Chancellor sought in 
Vacuum of Public Debate 

"It was my fantasy as a child to be chancellor of UC Berkeley, 
but when everyone here found out I was being considered, I got a 
lot of pressure to stay here. I'm not saying I would have taken the 

. job anyway, but it was a factor." 
- Vutan Gregorian, Univenity of Pennsylvania provost 

who turned down the Berkeley chancellonhip after reports 
were leaked to the pre. that he wu being consi_red for the 
post. 

BY JEFF BERESfORD· HOWE 
New. Editor 

By almost any standard, the 
tive-month search for a 
chancellor at UCSD has been 
extraordinarily tight -lipped. 

There have been virtually 
no leaks - no one who knows 
is saying who the finalists are, 
and the committee hasn't even 
made public its criteria for the 
position. 

UC President David Saxon 
has decided not to allow 
campus visitations, 10 the 
finalists won't be discovered 
that way. 

And, as San Diego Union 
jodmaJi.t Michael Scott-Blair 
noted, "Saxon'. got them 
running scared over this 
confidentiality thing. They 
aren't saying a thing." 

One professor on the 
committee, Stuart Hughes, 
won't even tell the pre .. when 
the committee meet •. 

Regent Vdrna Martinez, 
one of the 'few minority 
member. of the Board, 
wouldn't comment on a leak 
early this quarter that the 
committee wu hung up over 
naming women and minorities 
as finalists. 

Freeman Gilbert, a courtly 
Scripps professor from 
Kentucky, joins hi. coUeagues 
in refusing to say how many 
finali.ts there are. 

Cheryl Dunnett, the student 
representative, was almost 
removed by an AS Council 
frustrated over her unwilling-
ness to tell her friends or any 
AS officials who was being 
considered. 

She finally relented and told 
AS Vice President Nancy 
Laga the name. of the finatists 
from the ea.t and midwest, but 
not California. 

A RUdent search committee 
fonned to help Dunnett didn't 
know the names until the end 
of February because she didn't 
think it was appropriate to 
breach the larger committee's 
confidentiality . 

But not every committee 
runs like the committee here. 

At Berkeley, two committee 
members regularly leaked 
information to Daily 
Califomian reporter Barbara 
Serrano, and the paper had 
both men who were asked to 
fill the po.ition, Vartan 
Gregorian and Ira Michael 
Haymen, on their pages 
before Saxon could make an 
alVlOuncement. 

And, Serrano say., "we 
knew who eIae was being 
considered. We could have 
done profile. on any of them. 
One man being considered, for 
example, is supposed to have 

beat up a student." 
At Riverside, a local 

Riverside paper p.tblished the 
name of Tomas Rivera as the 
search committee prepared to 
announce his selection. 

Jim Johnson, editor of the 
Riverside student paper The 
Highlander, said the 
committee finally traced the 
leak to a member of the 
Literature deparbnent, who 
was told the good news by a . 
committee member that the 
new chancellor was a poet and 
literature professor. 

Why then, is the UCSD 
committee so quiet about its 
con.iderations ?

UC search proce ... 

"There's a whole pool of 
candidates eligible for a tof. 
executive position like this, ' 
Gilbert .ays. "It I doe.n't 
change very much from year 
to year. If you .tart treating 
people badly by revealing their 
names when they might not 
want their names to get out, 
then it's going to be harder to 

ge~ them to want to be 
cOnl.idered the next time 
around. 

'~The UCSD ~ocess isn't 
the only search. There will be 
others, and the UC system has 
to protect itself." 

San Diego Regent DeWitt 
Higgs, who hal served "on too 
many search committees to 
remember," concurs. 

"These candidates usually 
have top po.itions elsewhere, 
and generally don't want it 
known that they are 
con.idering the change. And 
there are more candidates 
than people actually selected. 
People don't want it known 
they weren't chosen," Higgs 
says. 
Another reason, the possibili-
ty that Saxon i. clamping 
down, trying . tQ avoid 
another Berkeley debacle, is 
frequently raised as a reason 
for the committee's silence. 

"Thi. i. hi. committee." a 
. UC administrator says. "He's 

made it dear he doesn't want 
anything going wrong here.

A new wrinkle in the 
process, graduate and 
undergraduate student 
members added to the 
committee, hasn't changed 
things, Higg. said. 

.. No information or 
suspicion that any of the 
student members have 
breached confidentiality i. . 
known to me, and that 
includes this committee," he 
says. 

Johnson say~ he didn't te!1 
anyone - his newspaper, 
friends, AS official. or 
professors - who was being 
considered. 

"I got a lot of pressure from 
people to talk, and if the relt of 
the committee had been 
talking, I suppose I would 
have too, ~ke at Berkeley. But 
it'. important not to 
compromise the position 01 the

Inflation Has Both' Ca~se iind Cure 
Editor: 

After reading Jonn CtIMiff. brief and vague 
inftation .aide (DaillJ Guardian, Feb. 28) I wu 
inclined to think he was considemg runnm, for 
public office. His rhetoric on inflation competes 
with some of the beat politically .. A.pedient 
,overnment offici. today. Mr. Cunniff haa 
learned the innalion game quite well. 

His c1iacua.ion of inflation lreat. the matter 81 
if it were lOme IOrt of my.teriou. force (his 
poIitical.HoIlywood term: fire.tonn) beyond our 
control that hat crept into our economy and 
de.troyed our .avings, investments and, "of 
courte, confidence." Like most vague 
politician., Mr. Cunniff doe.n't explain hi. pat 
expression.. What confidence waa it that 
inflation eroded? The confidence in being a 
auccesaful entrepreneur, or may be the 
confidence that inflation is not a government· 
created problem? He continues to .ay that the 
whole inflation problem i. 10 complex that it 
wiD take "year. to dig into the u~derlying 
problem.", problem I only the "economic 
experts" can find solution. to. 

The' problem, however, i. that the author, (like 
mo.t politicians) apparently doea not underltand 
inflation and cannot offer a aound explanation to 
.top it. He ltates that the inflation firemonater 
"mi,ht be dou.ed by offsetting an equally 
ruinous act of economic nature, a cold downpour 
of receuion." 

Nice uae of metaphor.; however, Mr. Cunniff 
i.grouly at error to conclude that a "receuion" 
or "crash" will be harmful to the economy. 'The 
fact it that the opposite i. true. We can live in a 
falae prosperity for 10 long. EventuaDy we'll have 

to face the reality that our national bill. from 
deficit spending are overdue and we mu.t pay for 
them. An economic "crash" wiD not be a 
desirable event, but in the lon, run, it wiD be 
beneficial for everyone for wage. and prices wiD 
settle to their nonnal, natural market levels. 

For a solution to inAation, the author gives 
none. He .tates our "be.t move now" it to 
"Iellen but not eliminate the pain" of inflation. 
Mr. CunniEr cannot offer a solution to inflation 
for, as I've mentioned previou.ly, he doel not 
understand the cau.e of inflation. He i. confusing 
the result of inflation-high prices-to be the 
cause of inflation believing that the inflation 
monster "might intensify" when "seDers lift 
pricel" to higher levels. 

~t the point be clear: increased wages and 
prices do not cauae inAation; in fact, they do not 
even contribute to it. Inflation i. cau.ed by only 
one thing: an increase in the aupply of money. 
Ri.ing prices (what people think of 81 inflation) 
are cau.ed primarily by the money supply 
increasing faster than the IUpply of goods and 
lervices. In other worda, inffation is too much 
money chaaing too feW goods. 

To .top inflation, incredible 81 it may seem, 
only one thing mUit be done: tum off the printing 
preltel. Now. 

If cour.e, the only one to do thi. is the 
J?vernment. It become. quite dear, then, that 
big butinea. doea not cause inflation, nor doea 
big labor. It it Big Brother who cauaea inflation, 
and he i. the only cause. And until we wake up fo 
the illusion that inflation i. a hidden tax and put 
an end to it, we wiD continue to live in an artificial,

State Department for release.

Uneven Randy Newman .00'5 on Cynicism 
BY MIKE 1HOMAS 

I've always had mixed 
feeling. about Randy 
Newman, and hi. 1010 concert 
lut Sunday night at 
Mandeville Auditorium did 
nothing to relOlve them. Vea, 
of courae, I agree that I0Il((' 
like "Sail Away" and 
"Loui.iana 1927" are 
certifiable maaterpif!ce. of 

The f)Kil.v Gual'dian 

exis .. aoIeIy for itself, instead 
of being part of a strong point 
of view, it can become aa 
contrived as a Don Ricklea 
routine ("See? I'm not 
prejudiced, I insult everybody 
equally") and sets up such 
easy day pigeona for satirical 
large" that any .. ay pot ahat 
wiD likely hit aomething. 

does absolutely nothing with it. 
lnatead of the barbed wit of a 
Jonathan Swift that Steve 
Eamedina hal called him, we 

• set a latter day Tom Lehrer. 
Since 1974's "Good 01' 
Boys" none of hi. albums have 
contained the conceptual 
brilliance which auatained that 
Ip or the lyricailOrhi.tication 
which graced "Sai Away". 

The show last night was a 
conaervative one. There was 

none of what Newman'. finest 
songs do-no chances taken 
nor sensibilitie. challenged. 
Newman has prpduced some 
of the most unlikely 
protagonists imaginable: a 
• Iave trading captain, a 
redneck raci.t, a rapist. Hi. 
gift for seeing and appreciating 
the voice of the social outcast 
is all the more remarkable for 
his lack of liberal sentimental· 
ity. His under.tated, elliptical 

style serves his ironic 
observations well and he has a 
great ear for turns of a phrase 
that can transform a song the 
way a line like "Down here the 
windt have chAnged" defines 
"Louisiana 1927" . 

At his moat irritating 
though, he can be alternately, 
cute, coy or condescending; as 
if he is the only one in on the 
joke that the world is crazy.

between the highlights of

: €Iass On Black Holes Dra\Vs the Curious 
Event Horizons, Singularities and Warped Spacetime Lure Lawyers and Doctors 

BY MARK WIlSON 
"Fascination with the stars 

is universal," insists Or. Bill 
Kaufmann, for whom a 
fascination with the cosmos 
has developed into a career. 

At the age of six, his father 
took him to the Haden 
Planetarium for hi. birthday 
which sparked enough interest 
for him to go on to get a PhD in 
astrophysics from Indiana 
University. He is presently a 
member of the SDSU faculty, 
and he has written a number of 
books in his field. Thelle all 
add up to a fascinating lecture 
series entitled "Black Holes 
and Warped Spacetime" 
given. through UCSO's 

Ext~n .. on program. 
Although the seminar 

centered on black holes, it 
covered much basic astro· 
nomy as preliminary material. 
Included were the life cycles of 
stars, the theory of relatiVity 
and an histOrical progres.ion 
of the advancements in 
astronomy. "A typical clan," 
says Kaufmann, "is the well 
off, educated, upper middle 
cia .. , generally lawyers, 
doctorl, teachers who want to 
continue a little bit of their 
education." 

For Kaufmann, black holes 
really aren't that c~licated. 
"The moat complicated black 
hole can have only three 
things: mass, charge and 
angular momentum (rotation). 
Other subjects, titre our sun, 
are physically much more 
compticated. In comparison, 
black holes are simple, but 
simply awesome," he says. 

"Because of the hole's 

rotation," he continues, "quite 
literally space and time are 
dragged around the hole." 
Their masses can range from 
that of an average mountain 
up to 70 times the mass of 
Earth's sun, said Kaufmann, 
and can be compacted into an 
area varying from the size of a 
pin point to 20 miles in 

The D.til,V Guardian 

Science 
diameter . . 

A black hole really is "a 
dying star ~terally crushing 
itself out of, existence." This 
happens when the star's 
thermonuclear reactions can 
no longer exert enough 

. outward force to counteract 
the star's inward gravitational 
force. Then if the star has 
enough mass, it can compact 
farther, forming a black hole, 
or super nova. According to 
Kaufmann, our section of the 
galaxy is long over due for a 
super nova, the last one being 
in 1084 AD forming the Crab 
Nebula. 

Scientists generally agree 
that even light cannot escape 
from a black hole. "The point 
where even a beam of light 
pointed straight up from the 
black hole is drawn back into it 
is called the event horizon." 
Inside the event horizon, time 
behitves like space and space 
behaves like time." Which 
means, says Kaufmann, that 
time stops. 

!At the center of the event 
horizon is nothing, a point

called the singularity. "The 
singularity is the point of 
infinitely war~ spacetime" 
which on an embedding 
diagram looks like an infinite 
funnel. This is the center of the 
black hole. 

Kaufmann laid out the 
basics to the theories as to how 
black holes, according to the 
formulas, could be used to 
travel to a negative universe or 
to universes that are both 
forward and backward in time. 
But as he points out, "it is 
really important in this 
business to try and determine 
what stuff we should believe in 

and what stuff is just fun 
mathematics." 

The gigantic gravitational 
force of a black hole is 
potentially a much greater 
source of energy than any sort 
of thermonuclear reaction, 
Kaufmann points out, if it 
could be harnessed. It might 
be possible to shoot an object 
into the black hole's 
gravitational field, and have it 
shoot out again with much 
more energy - energy which 
could be tapped. Even a very 
small black hole would be 
sufficient to supply all power tQ 
the Earth. 

A large portion of the 
lecture was .pent dealing with 
quasars, as it is thought they 
may be related to black holes. 
If they are the estimated 15 
billion light years away 
estimated by Hubble's Law. 
then for scienti.ts to be able to 
see them "they (quasars) muat 
shine with the briUiance of a 
hundred galaxie.," empha-
sizes Kaufmann. He 
compares the light from a 
hundred Milky Ways to the 
brightness of one quasar.

$600,000 Granted to Study 
Workings of Menstrual Cycle 

BY WAYNE VIUANUEVA 
Insight into the health problems of post· 

menopaUiai women, better methods of 
contraception, and a knowledge of the 
chemical mechanism ' of the men.trual cycle 
are just some of the benefits that are expected 
from a $600.000 lUant received by the 
UCSO School of Medicine earlier thia month. 

The grant, given by the Andrew W. Mellon 
Foundation, is to be used for research in 
reproductive medicine by faculty and post· 
doctoral fellows at the school. 

"Research in reproductive medicine wiD 
have profound health implications for 
society," says Samuel S. C. Yen, chairrnanof 

. the department of reproductive medicine and 
an internationally known rep-roductive 
biologist. 

"Right now, our research team is working 
on determining the specific mechanism 
,underlying the workings of the menstrual 
cycle, particularly, how the brain controls the 

relea.e 01 hormones to receptor lite. in target 
ti.sues." 

V eo explains that knowledge of .uch a 
mechanism may eventually lead to more 
efficient methods of birth control, treatment of 
the gynecological problems of post· 
menopausal women, and rernediea for 
infertility. 

"The growth of reproductive medicine i. 
due largely to the growth of the more general 
field of medical endocrinology," Yen adds. 
"During the last 12 years, there have been 
many advances in our undel'5tanding of the 
action of hormones 00 the body. Naturally, 
this allows us to under.tand more deeply the 
hormonal control of the reproductive system 
and much work ill now being done in this 
area. " 

Yen's research team has accumulated 
plenty of data concerning animal subjects and 
is now working on more data on where their

Stoma Patients Get Special The.rapy,

more than lOme Itates have." 
Connor ... ys. 

"The road to thi. unprece· 
dented accomplishment wu 
neither eaay nor short. Ten 
years and a lot of money were 
neces .. ry just to train and 
establi.h all the needed clinic 

from the time they realize

Hospitals have ETO-trained

COlts are a primary 

deterrent to stoma therapy. 
Connors says that because 
therapy is not covered by any 
third party payments, medical 
insurance companies rarely 
will foot the bill. Although the 
best threapy is very expensive 
in the short run, it is often 
cheaper in the long run, taking 
into account time, repair and 
replacement, according to 

Therapy Office," Connors 
says. "If you have to choose 
between bread and butter and 
paying for us , we'll have to 
go." 

But this is ironic, Connors 
says, because " we save (the 
state) money by reducing the 
amount ' of time a patient 
spends in the hospital and in 
surgery." 

Regardless of the econo-
mics involved, Connors says 
stoma patients must · first 
"come to terms with their own 
body image and sexuality." 

" You have to d,;cide 
whether you want to cover 
your head or meet each 
challenge. Patients must learn 
to see their stoma as a friend , 
not an enemy," she says. 

"There were so many things 
I couldn't do when I was sick . 
My family was absolutely 
thrilled to see me well," she 
says, pointing out the not-so-
obvious advantages of stoma 
surgery. 

"This is not elective surgery 
for most people," stresses 
Connors. "It is often a life-
saving operation; you have to 
decide whether life is 
worthwhile. Eventually the 
stoma will seem like less of a 
handicap and more of a
