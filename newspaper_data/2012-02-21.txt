SURF REPORT

UCSD to 
End TAG 
Program in 
Fall 2012
BY NICOLE CHAN
Associate News Editor

California community college 
students are no longer guaranteed 
admission to UCSD. The UCSD 
Committee on Admissions voted  
Dec. 8, 2011 to eliminate the Transfer 
Admission Guarantee program due 
to limited spaces for a continued 
increasing number of applicants. 

“The number of transfer students 
applying to UCSD has increased every 
year, whereas the number of spots 
available for them has not,” Committee 
on Admissions undergraduate 
representative substitute Adam 
Powers said in an email. “Accepting 
every transfer guaranteed under 
TAG would bring the composition of 
UCSD’s enrolled population far outside 
the guidelines set by the state, which 
mandates a certain ratio of new to 
continuing students.”

Students under TAG must complete 
UC math and English composition 
courses, and maintain a minimum 3.5 
GPA. Students must transfer as juniors.

Powers estimates that UCSD’s 
transfer admissions target for the 2011-
12 academic year was 2,410 students. 
However, 3,602 TAG applications 
were submitted under the new 3.5 
GPA requirement. Under the 2010-11

Court to Rule on Affirmative Action Ban
BY ZEV HURWITZ
Associate News Editor

A lawsuit filed in Federal Court this 
month aims to end a statewide ban on 
affirmative action and increase the number 
of minority students in public colleges. On 
Feb. 13, three members of the 9th Circuit 
Appellate Court heard arguments from 
affirmative action proponents who hoped  
to end the ban to increase diversity at top 
UC campuses. 

The lawsuit — Coalition to Defend 
Affirmative Action vs. American Civil Rights 
Institute — was originally formed in 2010 
by 46 minority students and the CDAA. It 
aims to overturn Proposition 209, which 
voters passed in 1996 and bans affirmative 
action. Proposition 209 prevents state-run 
schools and organizations from considering 
gender, race or ethnicity in contracting or 
admission decisions. 

The constitutional amendment was 

upheld in an initial appeal in 1997. A 
California judge dismissed the case in a 
lower court in 2010.

The San Francisco Examiner reported 
that George B. Washington, a plaintiff 
attorney and proponent for affirmative 
action, cited racial bias as the background 
for Proposition 209.

“It’s a special law, directed only at blacks 
and Latinos,” Washington said.

Many supporters of affirmative action 
turned out for the Feb. 13 opening remarks 
at the federal courthouse in San Francisco. 
A teacher at an Oakland high school told 
ABC News that the affirmative action ban 
limited potential in higher education for 
non-white students.

“This is a historic moment,” Tania 
Kappner told ABC News. “The opportunity 
to win affirmative action back for California 
and get the colleges to look more like our 
state, we need that,” 

In an effort to boost diversity, UC 

officials adopted holistic review last year, 
which includes the mandatory assessment 
of an applicant’s entire application before a 
decision can be reached. Considerations on 
race in admissions are already allowed when 
viewed as part of the whole application. 
In February 2011, the UC Office of the 
President released a statement stating that 
while diversity was an aim of holistic review, 
it could not be the most important factor in 
utilizing holistic review.

“Holistic review is not a silver bullet 
for climate and diversity problems, 
and is cautious about characterizing its 
individualized recommendation or the 
2012 freshman admissions reform policy it 
authored as attempts to increase diversity,” 
the UCOP statement said. “Diversity may 
be one outcome, but it is not the defining 
motivation.”

DIVERSITY

Members of the Judicial Board have claimed that the Election Appeals Board — created after the 2011 student 
elections — violates the A.S. Constitution. 

Council created the Election Appeals Board  
in Spring Quarter 2011.  In the election process, 
individuals or slates can file grievances, which 
are first heard by the Election Committee. If the 
plaintiff disagrees with the Election Committee’s 
ruling, she can bring the case to the Judicial Board. 
The job of the Appeals Board is to look at cases in 
the event that the plaintiff challenges the Judicial 
Board’s decision. According to Judicial Board Chair 
Polina Tsvetikova, the Appeals Board (Section 
5.5) violates Article VII, Section 1 of the A.S. 
Constitution.

Under the new section, Section 5.5 in Title 
IX 2011-12 of the Constitution, individuals can 
appeal the sanctions or decisions set by the Judicial 
Board. If at least three members of the Appeals 

Board, which is compromised of members from 
each college council, decides to hear the case, the 
Board can overturn the original ruling. Under the 
addition, the Appeals Board retains sole jurisdiction 
over determining whether the Judicial Board acted 
with bias. 

According to a presentation at the Feb. 15 
A.S. Council meeting, “[Section 5.5] impedes the 
Judicial Board’s ability to make decisions in a 
manner conducive to the efficient well-organized 
election that the bylaws envision, and will ultimately 
bog down the appeal’s process even more than they 
were in last year’s elections cycle.”

According to the presentation, filing a complaint 
under the new bylaws can take more than three 
days, since the complaint must go through as many 
as three tiers of appeals: the Election Committee, 
the J-Board and then the Appeals Board. 

“In case someone would like to appeal [the 
Judicial] Board’s decision, based on very ambiguous 
criteria ‘acting inappropriately,’ ‘evidence of 
partiality,’ as outlined in Section 5.5, the [Election 
Appeals Board] comes into place,” Tsvetikova said 
in an email. 

According to Tsvetikova, the Election Appeals 
Board interferes with the Judicial Board’s duties. 

“The Constitution states that the judiciary 
authority is vested in [Judicial] Board in regards 
to all cases and controversies that may arise, 
which includes cases during the elections period,” 
Tsvetikova said. “Creating the [Election Appeals 
Board] for the election period vests the final 
judiciary authority not in [Judicial] Board, which 
isn’t what the Constitution states.” 

The A.S. Constitution, dated April 16, 2009,  
states that the Judicial Board retains judicial 
authority in all cases and controversies that are 
brought up in regard to the Constitution, rules of 
ASUCSD or any of its subordinate bodies. 

The Judicial Board suggested removing the 
Election Appeals Board entirely and add a fourth 
section under Article VII in the Constitution. The 
proposed legislation would clarify that the Judicial 
Board has the authority to make the final decision, 
unless detailed evidence proving impartiality is 
presented.   “This would therefore allow [Judicial]

Board to act out its responsibility of 
being the judiciary authority for all 
cases,” Tsvetikova said. 

According to Tsvetikova, the board 
deemed the bylaws unconstitutional 
in early November and called for 
a meeting with the A.S. Advocate 
General. 

“After following up as early as 

Week Two of Winter Quarter, by 
Week Four the [Judicial] Board, after 
having addressed several members 
of Council, learned that Council as 
a whole was not aware of [Judicial] 
Board’s concerns,” Tsvetikova wrote.

According to A.S. Council’s 
standing rules, no changes can be 
made to the bylaws because the 
candidacy-filing period for the 
Spring 2012 election has already 

begun; it started during Week 
Five. The earliest the bylaws can 
be discussed would be Week Three 
of Spring Quarter and cannot be 
changed unless Council chooses to 
do so. 

The Advocate General could not 
be reached for comment.

academic year’s 3.0 GPA requirement, 
4,900 TAG applications were received. 

The committee recognized the 
need to make a decision about TAG 
since at least last year, Powers said.

According to Powers, community 
college students who acquired full-
time status by or before Fall 2011 will 
still be eligible to transfer to UCSD 
under TAG. The change will affect 
students who start at community 
colleges next year.

The 2010-11 committee, a 
standing committee within the 
Academic Senate, was composed 
of seven faculty members, former 
Sixth College Provost James Lin, 
ex-officio member Assistant Vice 
Chancellor of Admissions Mae 
Brown and undergraduate student 

representatives Jeremy Akiyama and 
Kristina Pham. Powers said that he 
and AVP of Academic Affairs Mac 
Zilber sat in for Akiyama and Pham 
on the day of the vote. 

Powers said that the 
elimination of TAG is unlikely to 
have any effect on future levels 
of transfer students at UCSD.  
     “The number of overall transfer 
applicants raises every year, so I 
would expect that whatever the 
requirement for admission is, UCSD 
will consistently hit its target for 
transfers,” Powers said.

Despite continued interest 
in UCSD, Powers said that the 
composition of the campus may be 
of concern. According to Powers, the 
average GPA of admitted non-TAG 
transfers was 3.9, which Powers said is 
considerably higher than the required 

3.5 GPA.
“It was assumed publicly by 

myself, and somewhat confirmed by 
the committee, that the elimination 
of TAG would place additional 
importance on UCSD examining 
factors other than academic 
achievement when evaluating 
transfer applications, in line with their 
‘individualized review’ methodology 
— which considers the strength of 
the individual in all aspects of their 
scholarship,” Powers said.

TAG programs are currently 
offered at UCSB, UC Davis, UC 
Irvine, UC Riverside, UC Santa 
Cruz and UC Merced. UCLA and 
UC Berkeley do not offer TAG 
programs.

Cigarette companies are fighting back against an FDA requirement to put graphic warning labels on cigarette packs. The proposed images — 
which include full-color photos of a diseased lung and a tracheotomy hole 
in a man’s throat — are meant to be overtly grotesque to scare customers 
away. Regardless of the fact that cigarettes have negative health consequences, 
enforcing a law that dictates the actions of private companies goes against a 
company’s First Amendment right of free speech.

The change was initially set to take effect by September 2012, but this past 
November, the U.S. District Judge Richard Leon blocked the required images 
from taking effect until after the lawsuit between the FDA and cigarette 
companies is settled.

Government-mandated anti-smoking messages should be factual and 
uncontroversial, but the proposed images cross the line into biased advocacy. 
The current warning labels on cigarette packs include hard facts such as 
“Cigarette smoke contains carbon monoxide” and “Smoking causes lung 
cancer, heart disease, emphysema, and may complicate pregnancy.” The 
images that the FDA is pushing to implement, which include staged photos of 
corpses, are explicit and physically unsettling. They are purported to cover the 
top 50 percent of a cigarette pack’s front and back panels, showing even more 
prominently than the company’s own branding. The text warnings educate 
customers, while the images actively repulse them from the product. Judge 
Leon contends that some, if not all, of these images are digitally altered to 
evoke emotion and endorse the government’s “obvious anti-smoking agenda.” 

It is clear that the cigarette companies have a strong case of free speech, as 
the images go beyond simply conveying facts.

Requirement Infringes Upon Companies’ Free Speech Rights Images Will Educate Public on Smoking’s Health Risks

Last June, the FDA mandated that by September 2012, cigarette manufacturers must add large graphic warning labels to their packaging. 
Five cigarette manufacturers claimed in court that the graphic warnings 
infringe on their freedom of speech, but the government rightly contends 
that public health concerns are paramount. The graphic warnings will offer 
an effective way to educate and inform consumers on the risks of smoking.

Since the Office on Smoking and Health was established in 1965, the 
government has taken steps to reduce the number of tobacco-related deaths. 
Despite their continuous efforts, the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention states that tobacco use causes one in five U.S. deaths annually. 
This is a sign that greater measures need to be taken to wean the public off 
smoking habits. In 2007, the Institute of Medicine, a U.S. federal advisory 
board, concluded that graphic warnings would give a better understanding 
of the health risks of smoking.  

The current health warnings on U.S. cigarette packages are not 
prominent enough to attract notice. The text warnings are placed along the 
sides of the packs in small typeface, with the colors and fonts resembling 
the rest of the package. Forty countries already require eye-catching graphic 
warnings. The new mandates will not only better inform consumers, but 
catch the U.S. up with the rest of the world. Several countries, including 
Australia, have already faced lawsuits from tobacco manufacturers with the 
proponents of graphic warnings usually emerging victorious.

The current health warnings insufficiently warn consumers about the 
often fatal consequences of smoking. The new images, being impossible to 
miss, will give consumers a chance to rethink picking up a cigarette.

The Guardian is moving. A�er years of being headquartered in a dingy 
cave of questionable functionality 
located over another dingy cave 
of questionable functionality  (Hi 
�ai), we’re heading to the space 
formerly known as the most 
disgusting o�ce on campus: the 
Media Lounge, or “old Koala 
o�ce.” �is latter reason is why 
the contractor hastened to specify 

the extent of planned renovations 
before revealing the old name of our 
new space. And it’s these extensive 
renovations that quelled my visceral 
reaction and started me thinking 
about the psychology of work 
spaces. 

�e current Guardian o�ce 
comprises a fairly large space in 
the Old Student Center. Step in, 
and you’ll be looking down a long 
hallway with o�ces lining both 
walls. Our most valued object is 
the water cooler. Our main room is 
usually deserted, since most people 
are in their o�ces, doors closed. 
I have spent the past three years 
trying not to think about what 
happens behind these doors.

According to science writer Jonah 
Lehrer, this type of arrangement 
is optimally non-conducive to the 
functionality of a collaborative 
organization. �e most important 
features of saidspace are horizontal 
design, collaboration and easy access.

Take the example of Building 20, 
the poorly designed MIT structure 
that became the starting point for 
some of the world’s biggest ideas. 
Building 20 was a miserable place: 
bad design, extreme temperatures, 
terrible lighting and it violated the 
�re code. Someone trying to �nd 
Department A had to walk through 
the entire building, bumping into 
people from other departments, 
before reaching the destination. 

Subsequently, MIT administration 
stuck the random and less prestigious 
people there, including everything 
from a piano repair facility to, 
ahem, the linguistics department. 
�e people stuck there retaliated by 
customizing the space, tearing down 
walls and bolting equipment to the 
roof.  And because of this — forcing 
people to rub elbows, letting them 
design their own workspace — the 
unwanted structure furthered 
developments in military radar,  and 
was the birthplace of both Noam 
Chomsky’s “universal grammar” 
theory of linguistics and Bose 
speakers. 

Granted, our sta� has more 
in common with each other than  
do piano repairmen and Noam 
Chomsky. Granted, we’ve been 
preemptively mourning the end of 
individual o�ces for the past three 
weeks. But come Spring Quarter 
when we’re all crowded around 
pods in a giant room, I expect great 
things. I expect the birth of a new 
kind of linguistics. I expect cross-
section collaboration. At the very 
least, I expect to know exactly where 
everyone is.

A Risky Loan

The cash-strapped state of California has utilized some drastic measures to solve its money issues, most recently in the form of 
taking a $200 million loan next month from the 
UC system, an institution from which it has just 
cut $650 million. The UC system is taking a leap 
of faith to support its main financier, who cannot 
operate properly without these funds. When it 
comes down to it, the UC system doesn’t have 
much choice but to loan the money. In the end 
though, this venture could prove beneficial to the 
universities as long as California reciprocates the 
assistance in the future.

The purpose of the loan from the UC system is 
to contribute to the necessary $2.5 billion financial 
cushion that the state needs in the event that 
revenues start to plummet dramatically. California’s 
staggering debt has caused its credit rating to dip 
from A-plus to A in 2009, while most states have 
AA and AAA ratings. As a result, any loans that 
the state might potentially take out from private 
institutions would have impractically high interest 

rates. On the other hand, the UC system has 
retained a good credit rating despite state budget 
cuts it has faced in recent years, and therefore can 
take out loans from an outside source at a much 
lower interest rate. The plan is to have the UC 
system borrow from a private source at an interest 
rate of 0.005 percent and then loan the money to 
the state at a 2 percent interest rate. As of now, 
California is slated to pay the money back with 
interest to the UC system by April 20 of this year.

The California may have every intention to pay 
the UC loan back by April, but given its past track 
record, it looks unlikely. The state is already in 
debt to the UC system for a whopping $1.7 billion 
due to this borrowing-lending plan in the past. In 
2009, the UC system loaned the state $200 million 
in exchange for ten voter-approved building 
projects on the UC campuses, which are still in 
the works. Again in July 2011, a bill was passed to 
establish an investment fund that the UC system 
and other agencies could contribute to as a way of 
maintaining the state’s cash flow. The UC system 

The state of  California may take a $200-million loan from the UC system on March 2, a move 
that is in the best interest of  the state and the future of  the university system.

Regents Should Devise Pay-Back Plan With State

IN OTHER NEWS By Rebekah Hwang LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Dear Editor,
The University of California 

currently has an endowment of 
$6,260,000,000, so why shouldn’t 
it lend it out?  One advantage of 
lending to the State of California 
is that over recent years — what 
with the budget crunch and all — 
the university has stipulated that 
as a condition of the loan, capital 
development projects at the UC 
campuses are to remain ongoing. 
Thus the cake isn’t sliced to help any 
other partner-in-government, and 
when the economy gets better, the 
UC endowment gets it all back, 
along with gratitude and compound 
interest. On the other hand, UC San 
Diego’s proposed Las Vegas Nevada 
Cancer deal requires the seller to 
raise $20 million (one-tenth more 
than the selling price of $18 million 
as reported in the Guardian) over 
five years, after the Nevada State 
legislature allotted $20 million — and 
ten times that amount was brought 
in “by star-studded benefits.” 

 The million is strictly a 
lagger; another $100 million loss 
was foisted on the creditors before 
the sale, yet the real cost is joining 
130 employees to the UC San Diego 
healthcare system. 

 Nevada state senator Sheila 
Leslie said “a lot of us wanted to 
improve the general healthcare in 
Nevada.” Thomas McAfee, Dean 
of Clinical Affairs at UC San Diego 
wants it the most. But according 
to the same article in the Union-
Tribune from which the Guardian 
reported, there are more than a 
baker’s dozen of ongoing clinical 
trials at the Las Vegas Nevada Cancer 
Center. How are such trials going 
to raise some money in the short 
run? 

 Another former stakeholder 
in the bankrupt research institute 
said the whole undertaking had 
become “a black hole.” UCSF/UC San 
Diego should remain “departments 
of the university, ‘coordinate with 
its already existing departments.’” In 
seeking to acquire Illumina, Roche 
is looking to bolster its presence 
in the increasingly important area 
of genetic sequencing. Illumina is 
one of the biggest makers of high-
speed DNA sequencing machines, 
accounting for roughly half of the 
market. Kamala Harris, Attorney 
General of the State of California, 
may ask why UC entities with 
“winning” assets are being spun off, 
while “losing” entities like English 
departments at “lesser” UCs are 
retained.

 My deceased elder brother left 
my nephew a substantial amount of 
money, which my nephew invested 
in Las Vegas real estate. None of his 
money remains. How do you make 
a small fortune?  Start with a large 
fortune. 

This particular Las Vegas deal 
isn’t about curing cancer. It’s about 
the privatization of UC to benefit 
principal stakeholders. What 
guarantee do you have that 
your tuition won’t be raised simply to 
benefit “the ultimate power couples” 
such as those who attended the 
benefits in Nevada?

invested one billion dollars into the fund, which the 
state won’t have to pay back until October of this year. 
With yet another loan on the state’s wishlist, it seems 
unlikely that any of these loans will be paid back by 
the scheduled time. While the loan may not be paid 
back promptly, the interest generated from the loan, 
though modest, will pump some extra funds into the 
universities. Therefore, once the state follows through 
with the payment, the UC system will come out on top 
while also assisting the state. 

Dianne Klein, spokesperson for the UC system, 
sums up the catch-22 the UC system is in. “By loaning 
the state money and risking that they don’t pay [the 
UC system] back on time, we’re putting ourselves on 
the line,” she said. “It’s a show of good faith when the 
university lends money to the state.” The situation 
leaves the UC system in a tough place: they can loan 
the money with little assurance that it will be paid back 

in a timely way or risk the state losing money.
The UC Board of Regents, which has the final say in 

the decision over the loan, needs to devise a solid plan 
with the state in order to get the money back on time 
in April, but it should also add a few stipulations to 
this loan. Mainly, they should make sure the state sees 
the UC as a priority for funding in times of economic 
crisis, not something that is first in line to get cut. In 
time, this should become a long-term plan, where the 
UC has a reserve fund from the state as money to fall 
back on in case of another economic recession. 

For now, it’s wise that the UC is willing to work 
with the state in hopes of extra support in the coming 
years, but history is known to repeat itself —and our 
history with the state isn’t a good one. The UC needs to 
make a bold move with this loan in order to make sure 
its relationship with the state takes a turn for the better.

6 THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 21,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

UCSD postdoctoral researcher Mercedeh Khajavikhan has spent countless hours at work inside the Nano3 facility and the optics lab on the third floor of the Engineering 
building. But all her work was not in vain; her study 
on lasers, a collaboration with her colleagues at the 
UCSD Jacobs School of Engineering, has resulted in the 
development of the smallest-ever, room-temperature 
nanolaser along with a highly efficient threshold-less 
laser — or a laser that starts lasing immediately with 
very little power. The new, innovative design could serve 
as an important tool in medical research.

The unique aspects of the laser have big implications 
for scientific studies. The miniscule size of the open-
ing, around 100 nanometers, allows for the detection of 
HIV viruses and single molecules — an advancement 
in spectroscopy (the study of the interaction between 
matter and radiated energy). The laser may also be used 
in optical devices and future computer chips — opening 
possibilities for incredibly cutting-edge technology.

The secret lies in the coaxial structure of the device: 
Instead of the previously used box that wasted much of 
the generated light and its energy, a cylinder with a metal 
rod at its center is used, which can support a laser beam 
(however small it may be).

“We can play with the size of the structure and 
the metal rod,” Khajavikhan said about the cutting-edge 
design. “When we squeeze light into this very small struc-
ture, we start to play with its environment.”

For Khajavikhan, the lead author of the study, the idea 

of creating a threshold-less laser first came to her while 
experimenting in the lab in October 2010.

“First, we made these lasers with only a rough idea 
as to their potential,” Khajavikhan said. “We were trying 
different sizes and then I postulated that if the structure 
can isolate one mode, then the lasing should occur in a 
threshold-less fashion.”

She immediately emailed her colleagues after her initial 
discovery, and the project was soon underway. But recog-
nizing the right structure didn’t make things simpler; there 
was still the tedious process of finding the correct size.

“It took me some time to tune the sizes to find a 
threshold-less one,” Khajavikhan said. “In the coaxial 
structure, you get all sorts of new modes inside the cavity. 
To assort the modes and find their properties, I asked my 
colleague, Dr. Amit Mizrahi, for help. By changing the size 
even slightly, new modes appear and old modes move out 
of the material’s natural window of emission. It was hard 
to find the coaxial laser cavity that was actually the right 
size. And it took us a bit of time to find the one with the 
threshold-less behavior, but we found it.”

On March 31, 2011, the project was done and 
Khajavikhan and her team had officially built a threshold-
less laser.

“We understood the potential of these coaxial struc-
tures and finally found the right ways to exploit them,” 
Khajavikhan said.

At this stage of the work, Khajavikhan turned to her 
colleague, Michael Katz, to compare the experimental data

THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 21,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG 7

Computer and Electrical Engineers Develop Tiny, Threshold-less Lasers
to the rate equation model (a set of equations that governs the 
laser behavior), mainly to get a fresh and unbiased opinion about 
the work. The results conclusively confirmed the threshold-less 
predication.

“Because of the unprecedented capability of squeezing light 
into these very small structures, it allows us to experimentally 
study some quantum electro-dynamical effects,” Khajavikhan 
said. “We can show and measure many effects that physicists have 
theoretically predicted in the last 70 years.”

By shrinking the structure down to practically the size of the 
light waves themselves, or “nurturing” the light’s environment, 
researchers can begin to really observe what has been held to be 
supposedly true by “nature.”

Khajavikhan, who moved from Iran in 2004 and received 
her Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering in 2009 at the University of 
Minnesota, explained how in some cases, nurture trumps nature. 

“For a very long time, people used to think that [the gen-
eration of glow-in-the-dark light] was the property of the mate-

rial, but now, from 
1946 onwards, it’s 
not really all about 
nature; it’s equally, 
and sometimes 
more importantly, 
about nurture,” 
Khajavikhan said. 
“It’s about what 
you put around 
the light, and this 
effect only shows 
itself when you 
squeeze light into 
very small areas, 
like what we have 
done now.”

The proper-
ties of a laser are 
dependent on the 
size of the struc-
ture, which sup-
ports modes 

(standing waves within the metal-based structure). Once you 
reach the size at which the cavity supports a single mode, it’s 
considered a threshold-less laser that generates a coherent beam 
of light as soon as it starts emitting (this light source is only one-
fifteenth the size of the light waves it produces). This is unlike 
conventional lasers that first emit incoherent light and take a lot 

of energy to begin lasing.
Khajavikhan emphasized that no research discovery is pos-

sible without numerous sleepless nights, going back to the funda-
mentals one learns in school and perhaps most importantly, a lot 
of discussions and exchange of ideas with colleagues and mentors.

“I think I owe a lot to the University of California, San 
Diego — to many of the faculty, including Professors Shaya 
Fainman,Vitaliy Lomakin and Tara Javidi,” Khajavikhan said. 
“UCSD has the environment to allow this kind of research, and 
most people that I have worked with are just wonderful people. 
The fact that they were there listening to my thoughts, sharing 
their ideas with me and giving me the chance to go and think 
about those ideas too, eventually helped the project. A lot of good 
ideas have been generated and developed during the discussions 

with my colleagues. I think the discussions are the main part of 
research, and to me, that was collaboration and team work.”

Khajavikhan, now a staff research volunteer at UCSD, is hope-
ful about her research and wants to continue her study on lasers 
in the future.

“I still have high hopes in this line of research; I think there 
is still a lot more to be done,” Khajavikhan said. “On a few occa-
sions, after presenting our work, many of our colleagues at other 
schools, like Stanford, USC and Berkeley, have come up and told 
us that this looks very promising. There seems to be a consensus 
that our discovery will have a major impact, so at least for the next 
few years I sure hope to be busy.”

S ince Feb. 5, every flyer handed out on Library Walk responsibly disposed of in the recycling bin has been counted in a larger, nationwide recycling competi-
tion called RecycleMania. UCSD is currently in a race 
against over 500 colleges across the continent to determine 
who can collect the most tons of recyclable material by 
March 31. 

At stake is nationwide recognition and a huge trophy 
(made, of course, from recycled material) for the top recy-
clers. But the real prize here is the creation of a network 
of campuses committed to global green efforts. In order 
to make a strong standing, the whole school must rally 
together.

This is UCSD’s seventh consecutive year of partici-
pation, and the school’s main organizers hope to boost 
numbers from last year’s showing — 432 tons of recycled 
waste. UCSD has always occupied a top rung amongst 
RecycleMania schools in California but still has a long way 
to climb on the national ladder. Last year, Tritons made 
their way into the top 100 list of schools, coming in 87th 
place in the Grand Champion category of the competi-
tion, at a recycling rate of about 35 percent (Cal State San 
Marcos, the first place winner, rang in with a whopping rate 
of 80 percent recycle rate). However, in the Gorilla Prize 
category, which measures gross tonnage of combined paper, 
cardboard, bottles and cans, UCSD scored in fourth place.

Alonso Nobles, assistant superintendent of facilities 
management and campus waste manager, is working to 
increase student knowledge of RecycleMania by placing 
banners and flyers around campus, while collaborating 
with the residential life offices to publicize to the students. 

Though supportive, Nobles said the facilities on campus 
are not taking the initiative to garner the participation nec-
essary to push UCSD over the edge, and Nobles believes 

that this campus-wide unawareness is a major obstacle to 
UCSD’s success. Flyers and stickers advertising the com-
petition have gone largely unnoticed by most students, and 
residential life hasn’t stressed the importance of student 
participation. 

“I have noticed that other schools saturate their student 
populations with information about the competition, espe-
cially at the athletic events,” Nobles said. “At the Spirit Night 
rally, they were supposed to mention RecycleMania to the 
students, but those who attended didn’t hear them say any-
thing. Also, we’ve asked the residential life offices to have 
the RAs distribute information throughout their areas, but 
I’m not sure that they’ve publicized it enough.”

 Campuswide unawareness is just one of the problems 
that Nobles is encountering with UCSD in RecycleMania. 
He also receives many complaints from building managers 
about the disposal of trash, and how many janitors are not 
taking into account the difference between recycle bins and 
trash bins when they’re emptying them. In the dining halls 
as well as faculty buildings across campus, many workers 
simply throw everything into one spot in order to save 
time. Right now, the amount of trash going into recycling 
bins and vice versa is at 30 percent, and UCSD’s goal is to 
decrease that number.

 The RecycleMania competition is very successful 
nationwide among other universities, but only when the 
entire community is involved. 

“We need the cooperation from everyone,” Nobles said. 
“While there is a disconnect between students at UCSD, 
we want to just let everyone know how easy it is to make a 
responsible decision.”

Track & Field Sweeps 
Meet, Wins 25 Events

In each half they went 14-27 to show their shooting 
is not as bad as the season-low 24 percent they threw 
up last Saturday. 

Friday, the team went up against Cal State East Bay, 
who sits just above the Tritons in the CCAA rankings. 

Senior power forward Mike Meza had a career high 
21 points, all of them threes, to put himself in the 
record books. 

The seven three pointers in one game is the most 
since Tyler Acevedo hit seven four years ago. 

His three pointers rank fifth all time for hits in a 
single game.

McCann and McCullough had 15 points apiece, show-
ing that the future of the Triton team is very bright. Hatch 
had 11 points on the night and, more impressively, nine 
rebounds to equalize the rebounds each squad had at 33.  
       “We played very well tonight,” head coach Chris 
Carlson said to the UCSD athletics department. “That’s 
certainly not one of the better teams we’ve seen by any 
means, but it’s very hard to win on the road in this 
league and we came to play. We jumped on them early 
and didn’t let up.” 

It is hard to find a difference between the two teams 

on paper, other than the fact that the Pioneers scored 50 
points in the second half to the Tritons’ 37. 

The Tritons hit more three pointers, 11 to 10, and 
had a better shooting percentage, 52 percent to 43 per-
cent, but in the end it’s about how many times you put 
the ball in the bucket. 

The Tritons hit 22 from the field while the Pioneers 
hit 25.

“We got some injuries right now but our team is real 
excited about this last road trip,” McCann said. “We 
really want to go out strong for our seniors.”

After falling to 6-14 in the CCAA, the Tritons have 
eliminated themselves from advancing to the eight-
team conference tournament.

UCSD’s last two conference games are slated for 
next week. 

On Wednesday, the Tritons will face Humboldt 
State and on Saturday, UCSD rounds out the season at 
Sonoma State. 

“I don’t think we have ever won at Humboldt and 
they always have a great crowd so we are really looking 
forward to that game.” McCann said.

Beerman also kept her ground and 
gave the stick to Rose in a similar 
position. Rose had an outstanding 
run and pulled away from the field 
by more than 10 meters to hand off 
to junior anchor Kathleen Hitchens, 
who added insult to injury and sev-
eral more meters to make the win-
ning time 49.13. 

Although this time does not crack 
the UCSD top 10, it is a good start 
with such a young squad. Rose then 
returned to the track for the 400 
meter, where she led the entire length 
for a personal record 
of 55.82, moving her to 
within several tenths of 
a second of the school 
record, and stands as 
a provisional qualifier 
for the NCAA National 
Meet. Rose also won the 
200m with a 25.46 per-
sonal record, helping 
the women’s 4x400m 
team — Irish, Snover, 
Meagher, Rose — put 
the final touches on the 
UCSD women’s 169-91 
victory.

Another standout of the day was 
junior thrower Jessica Miklaski, who 
threw 134’3” — an NCAA provi-
sional qualifying mark. The junior 
was satisfied with her throw. 

“There’s still more to come, its 
really early in the season so to be 
throwing this far now is exciting,” she 
said. “But at the same time, I really 
want to throw farther. For now I’m 
really happy though.”

Langford, a senior, jumped to set 
a new personal record of 37’10” in 
the triple jump, winning that event 
along with the long jump, and setting 

a staggering third NCAA provisional 
qualifying mark in the triple for the 
Triton Women’s squad.

“Any time you can get four 
national qualifying marks in a sea-
son opener it’s a good day,” UCSD 
men’s head coach Anthony Salerno 
said. “Both teams competed very 
well against two long-time rivals in 
Claremont-Mudd-Scripps and Cal 
Poly Pomona.”

Freshman Veronica Bradley also 
had a good first-ever collegiate meet, 
winning the high jump at 5’3” and 
coming in second in the long jump 

to Langford and third 
in the triple jump at 
36” even.

On the throws side, 
the Tritons won six of 
the eight events, with 
the women throwers 
winning every event 
they competed in: 
Miklaski took the jav-
elin, sophomore Eva 
Isaacs won the shot-
put at 38’4” and junior 
Uchenna Agbahiwe 
finished first in the 
discus at 136’9”, with 

senior Shana Emile taking the ham-
mer throw at 144’2.5”. 

“It was a good start to the season,” 
women’s head coach Darcy Ahner 
said. “And [it is] always great to see so 
many event winners and early season 
personal records.”

Both the UCSD Men’s and 
Women’s track teams head to the 
Rossi Relays at Pomona this coming 
Saturday in Claremont, where com-
petition will begin at 12 p.m.

MEN’S VOLLEYBALL

BY NICK HOWE
Associate Sports Editor

This past weekend the Triton Men’s Basketball team went on the road to face Cal State Monterey Bay on 
Friday and Cal State East Bay on Saturday. 

The Tritons surged past Monterey 
Bay thanks to junior guard Tyler “The 
Light-Switch” McGrath’s career high 21 
points, but the team failed to maintain 
its offense as it fell 83-71 to the Warriors. 
    The team’s win on Saturday marks UCSD’s 
first win on the road since the Tritons beat 
the Academy of Art way back in November. 
       The game was dominated by the Tritons 
from the get-go, with senior forward 
Christian Hatch winning the tip and getting 
the offense going to the tune of 11-5 on a 
“Light-Switch” triple. 

Hatch went on to have a great night, 
hitting eight of ten from the field for 18 
points and bringing down six rebounds. 
    Sophomore McKenzie McCullough had 15 
points on six of twelve from the field along 
with four rebounds. 

McCullough along with standout sopho-
more point guard James McCann, represent 
the core of next year’s Triton team. 

McCann had nine points and five assists on 
the night, as he again led the Triton backcourt. 
    UCSD led by as much as 20 points with 8:42 
remaining, with the score 40-60, before end-
ing the night with a comfortable 13-point lead.  
     The team shot 52 percent from the field.

The No. 1 nationally ranked UCSD Women’s Basketball team now stands two games away from closing out its 
regular season as undefeated.

The Tritons have already clinched a 
conference tournament berth with their 
26-0 record. 

And now, going into the last weekend 
of conference play, they have captured 
the regular season title with wins against 
second in conference Cal State Monterey 
Bay and seventh place Cal State East Bay.

On Friday, the Tritons topped Cal State 
Monterey Bay (17-6) on the road, beating 
the Otters by eight points — their closest 
victory since their double overtime win 
against Chico State on Jan. 7.

Cal State Monterey Bay took the early 
lead in front of a raucous home crowd of 
817 people, but the Tritons took charge 
with a three-point play from senior 
forward Lauren Freidenberg and a 
three-pointer from senior spot up 
shooter Daisy Feder in their next 
possession. 

Feder went three-of-seven 
from behind the arc and five-
of-16 from the field for 17 
points. 

Freidenberg also finished 
with 17 points, while junior 
guard Emily Osga led the 
Tritons in scoring with 20 
points. The point guard 
went an outstanding 
7-of-12 from the field, 
finishing all three of her 
three-point attempts.

From there, UCSD never 
relinquished the lead, ending the second 
period with a slight four-point advantage. 

Despite shooting just 39.4 percent from 
the field in the second half, the Tritons were 
able to extend their lead to eight by the end 

of the half when Osga caught fire. 
The starting point guard scored eight 
points in a three-minute span to 
jump start the Triton offense.

“Tonight was just another 
example of the balance this team 
has,” Elliott said to the UCSD 
athletics department. “We don’t 

have to rely on any one 
player to score to win. 
We have several indi-
viduals that can step 
up and get the job 
done and to see 
such a balanced 
effort in a tough 
environment on 
the road was 
really impres-
sive.” 

    On 
S a t u r d a y , 
the Tritons 

took their 20th regular season win against 
11-7 Cal State East Bay. The Pioneers, who sit 
in seventh place in the conference standings, 
are currently posed to secure a post confer-
ence if they can take a win from bottom-of-

the-league Cal State Stanislaus in the coming 
weekend.

 UCSD got off to an uncharacteristically 
slow start. The Tritons trailed at the end of 
the first half 30-31 after shooting 11-of-29 for 
37.9 percent shooting. 

“Tonight was another example of how 
tough it is to play on the road in this 

league,” Elliott said 
to the UCSD Athletic 
Department. “East 
Bay was ready to play 
tonight and gave us a 
great battle. 

We had a great start 
to the second half and 
then we were able to 
put the game away 
with the big run at the 
end.”

Down 30-31, the 
Tritons took the lead 
as the second period 
opened, with UCSD 
hitting three consecu-
tive three-pointers 
from Feder and senior 

guard Chelsea Carlisle.
With 14 minutes left to play, UCSD led by 

as many as 12 points, but the Pioneers slowly 
chipped away to cut the deficit back down to 
single digits with six minutes left to play. 

The Tritons succeeded in slowly wear-
ing the Pioneers down as Elliott fielded her 
reserves and ran up the score to increase the 
lead by 18 points by the end of the game.

UCSD will end its regular season on the 
road, with two more games against Humboldt 
State on Wednesday, Feb. 22 and Sonoma 
State on Saturday, Feb. 26.

“We’re looking to continue making his-
tory at UCSD this season,” Osga said. “And 
do something that’s never been done here 
before, win the conference tournament.”

Saturday, the UCSD Men’s and Women’s Track and Field teams kicked off the 2012 season with a resounding pair of wins 
against perennial rivals Cal Poly Pomona and 
Claremont-Mudd-Scripps.

On the men’s side, senior thrower Dane 
Sandifer clawed his way to the school’s top 10 
list with a discus throw of 156’3.5”, coming in 
second to fellow Triton, junior Zach Nagengast, 
who ended his long day with a mark of 158’3.5”. 
Earlier in the day, Nagengast also won the ham-

mer with a throw of 170’6.5” and followed up 
with a third-place finish in the shot put. The 
junior is pushing NCAA marks, hoping to 
make those marks next week at the Rossi Relays 
Invitational at Claremont. 

Triton senior jumper KaWai Ng made the 
leap to sit among the school record holders in 
the triple jump. The Hong Kong native jumped 
an astounding personal best of 49’6.5”. 

The mark is a provisional qualifying mark — 
an especially strong one seeing as it only took 
48’10” to make the NCAA National meet in 
2011. Ng also took first in the long jump with a 
mark of 22’4.5”, ahead of senior jumps captain 

Jeff Head, 21’8”, and senior Shaun Tu, 20’11”.
Other event winners on the Triton men’s 

side include sophomore Kellen Levy, who ran 
an 8:40.59 to take the 3k ahead of sophomore 
Ben Rich — who crossed the line eight seconds 
later for second place. 

Junior transfer Quentin McWhorter won the 
110m hurdles with the time of 15.96. Freshman 
standout Jake Herbold won the 400m hurdles 
with a time of 55.93s, a scoring mark at last 
year’s conference meet and an amazing time 
for such a young collegiate career. Jake “The 
Snake” is going to be an all-American to watch 
out for. Sophomore Ben Berthet set a personal 

best in the pole vault at 14’9 inches to open a 
very promising run at the CCAA crown. Senior 
all-rounder Nicholas Howe took the high jump 
at 6’3.5”, but was disappointed to not go higher 
after clearing 6’9” last week at the alumni meet.

Although the men stood out, the women 
shone brighter, with senior sprint team captain 
Jacqueline Rose and senior jumps team captain 
Erin Langford leading the way.

The women’s 4x400m relay started with 
freshman Elexi Snover running a strong first 
leg and handing off the baton to freshman 
Jessica Beerman right in the middle of the pack.
