S.D. Landmark Under Fire Again

By Deepak Seeni
Staff Writer

Last week marked the beginning 
of a new legal battle over the Mount 
Soledad Cross, which has once again 
fallen under criticism from oppo-
nents who claim its presence to be 
a gross violation of the principle of 
separation of church and state. The 
cross, which has been the subject 
of numerous legal battles since the 
1980s, is located on federal govern-
ment property. 

The American Civil Liberties 
Union of San Diego and the Jewish 
War Veterans Association have come 
together to challenge the presence of the 
cross on government land, stating their 
case in U.S. District Court last week. 

Both groups argue that the cross 
shows religious favoritism, claiming 
that if the government is to maintain 
the memorial atop Mount Soledad 
— which commemorates soldiers lost 
in the Korean War — it must do so in 
a secular, religiously neutral fashion.

David Blair-Loy, legal director for 
the ACLU of San Diego and Imperial 
Counties, said the cross’ presence vio-
lates the separation between church 

and state. 
“The ACLU and the Jewish War 

Veterans Association both believe 
that the display of religious symbols 
in the private sphere is an important 
and constitutionally protected right,” 
he said. “However, there is a differ-
ence between families and religious 
communities expressing what they 
believe in and the U.S. government, 
who is responsible for equal repre-
sentation among all its citizens, pro-
moting the beliefs of one faith over 
all others.”  

Cross supporters, in line with U.S. 
Supreme Court decisions made in 
2005 which allow for the presence 
of certain religious symbols if they 
are part of a larger secular purpose, 

maintain that the cross is merely one 
aspect of a memorial paying honor 
to those that died during the Korean 
War. 

Controversy over the cross first 
arose following a lawsuit filed in 1989 
by Philip Kevin Paulson, a local San 
Diego resident and Vietnam War vet-
eran. City officials have made numer-
ous attempts to display the cross as a 
war memorial with an overall secular 
purpose. However, following its pres-
ence being challenged by Paulson in 
1989, the Mount Soledad cross has 
witnessed some significant changes, 
including the placement of a plaque 
at the base of the cross denoting it as a

The Mount Soledad cross has come under fire several times over the last two decades from opponents 
who claim that its placement on federal land violates separation of church and state.

Students Protest Education CutsEffects of College 
Loan Crisis Uncertain

By Candice Wu
Senior Staff Writer

Sallie Mae, the nation’s largest stu-
dent loan company, announced last 
week that its government-funded stu-
dent loan program will soon suffer a 
financial shortage as a consequence of 
increased borrowing costs and a new 
law that reduces the amount of govern-
ment subsidies for guaranteed student 
loans. 

Currently, student loan interest rates 
are capped at 6.8 percent, creating a loss 
in profit for each federal loan Sallie Mae 
issues. Formally known as SLM Corp., 
Sallie Mae reported a loss of $103.8 
million in the first quarter of 2008, in 
comparison with a profit of $116.2 mil-
lion last year.

There are two types of student 
loans: those secured by the federal 
government through lending com-

panies and the U.S. Department of 
Education, and those within privately 
funded programs. The economic crisis 
is most damaging to the latter of the 
two, according to Executive Director 
of America’s Student Loan Providers 
Kevin Bruns.

Student loan companies receive 
their finances for loans from an invest-
ment source and in turn are able to 
lend out these loans at a higher cost, 
and the difference between the two is 
where lenders like Sallie Mae generate 
their profit. However, the recent credit 
crisis that has proliferated through the 
U.S. economy has jeopardized the vari-
ous funds that lenders need in order to 
provide student loans. Sallie Mae and 
other companies were able to absorb 
the fees charged by their sources and 
issue loans at discount rates, but now 
affordability is in remission and the dif-
ference in the loans shows up in tuition 
as a statutory fee. 

“The amount of money it costs to 
make the loans will be higher because 
the lenders aren’t making the same 
level of profit [compared to] past years,” 
Coordinator of Student Financial 

Despite nationwide 
panic over the health of 
student loans, university 
officials say UC students 
shouldn’t worry.

Bill Places New Regulations 
on Future UC Contracts

By Sarah de Crescenzo
Senior Staff Writer

The Senate Government 
Organization Committee approved a 
bill last week concerning the regulation 
and level of public access to University 
of California contracts.

The bill, authored by Sen. Leland 
Yee (D-San Francisco/San Mateo), rep-
resents a reaction to past and present 
business issues with companies con-
tracted by UC Santa Barbara and UC 
Davis, and would require all companies 
seeking to enter into contracts with 
the UC system to answer a question-
naire designed to identify irresponsible 
firms and to ensure that no business 
relationships are developed with such 
companies. The survey would include 
questions about companies’ past busi-
ness practices, such as their history of 
tax payment as well as their adherence 
to fair labor practices.

Adam Keigwin, Yee’s communica-
tions director, said the legislation aims 
to accomplish three objectives related 
to the contracts the UC system enters.

“[The bill] is designed to require 
contracts to be limited to a three-year 

term to make sure that taxpayers and 
students are getting the best value for 
the price, to introduce a questionnaire 
so that the UC knows the business 
histories of the companies with whom 
they contract, and to increase the 
transparency of the business contracts 
into which the university is entering,” 
Keigwin said. 

In a statement concerning the leg-
islation, Yee referred to a number of 
examples of contractual discrepancies 
that spurred him to take action. A 
contract that was awarded to a paint-
ing company at UCSB, for instance, 
ended when the company declared 
bankruptcy, leaving employees with 
no compensation for the work that 
they had already completed for the 
university.

Yee also decried a situation at UC 
Davis, where the company Sodexho 
has held the contract for food services 
for over a decade. With the bill, the 
university will be required to open the 
contract to bidding every three years.

“Sodexho has given millions to UC 
Davis, and in return appears to have 
been granted a ‘no-bid’ contract, as no 
other entity has been allowed to bid for 
the contract for over a decade,” Keigwin 
said. “While companies with long-term 
contracts like Sodexho could be possi-
bly providing the best value, we do not 
know if this is true since other entities 
have not been allowed to bid for that 

Legislation would 
survey companies before 
entering contractual 
agreements to increase 
transparency.

Researchers Receive 

Grant for Human Aging
Scientists researching the pro-

cess of human aging at the UCSD 
School of Medicine division of 
geriatrics will receive a grant of 
nearly $2 million from the Larry L. 
Hillblom Foundation to continue 
their work.

“We are proud to support 
research of such great prom-
ise for patients of advanced 
age,” President of the Hillblom 
Foundation Peter J. Donnici said 
in a statement. “This study at 
UC San Diego is an excellent 
fit with the philanthropic mis-
sion of our foundation. We are 
pleased to provide the funding for 
this groundbreaking, innovative 
research which has the poten-
tial to positively affect individuals 
nationally and globally.”

The research is part of a four-
year project aimed at understand-
ing the biology behind the human 
aging process. 

Goals of the project include 
potentially developing mecha-
nisms by which to reduce the 
negative impacts of aging on 
the human body, including such 
chronic afflictions as Alzheimer’s 
disease, cardiovascular disease 
and diabetes. 

“This research should provide 
important insight into some of the 
most fundamental questions relat-
ed to the process of aging,” head 
of UCSD’s division of geriatrics 
Laura Dugan said. “The primary 
objective of the research is to 
identify the underlying problems 
of aging and to develop interven-
tions to overcome them. We are 

extremely grateful to the Larry 
L. Hillblom Foundation for their 
continued generous and compre-
hensive support of aging research 
at UC San Diego.”

Nokia to Honor Birch

The Birch Aquarium at Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography will 
receive a $25,000 donation from 
Nokia this week at the multina-
tional communications compa-
ny’s special community E-Waste 
Collection Event on April 26.

Nokia is honoring the aquar-
ium for its ongoing efforts to 
educate the public about glob-
al climate change, and specifi-
cally for its new award-winning 
exhibit, “Feeling the Heat: The 
Climate Challenge,” an attraction 
that seeks to explain the science 
behind global warming.

“We have chosen Scripps 
Oceanography for this donation 
because of its strong presence 
in San Diego and because it is 
a true educator on the environ-
ment and climate change,” Senior 
Vice President of Nokia’s CDMA 
Business Larry Paulson said in a 
statement. “Creating awareness is 
incredibly important and ‘Feeling 
the Heat’ definitely accomplishes 
that goal. Nokia plans on making 
this an annual donation.”

During Nokia’s E-Waste 
Collection Event, San Diego 
County residents will have the 
opportunity to drop off old elec-
tronic devices for safe disposal at 
the company’s headquarters near

Support for the UC Office of the 
President Nancy Coolidge said. “Since 
the government has reduced — not 
eliminated — the amount of subsidies 
provided, the students will pick up 
some of the difference.”

Despite this turn of events — which 
is making college students across the 
country anxious about financing their 
education — university officials say 
UCSD students’ primary source of 
aid, federal loans, will remain rela-
tively untouched. Coolidge said the 
effects of the increase in private loans 
will most likely surface as a 1-percent 
origination fee for UC students. 

“The lenders are passing along the 
change, so that’s what UCSD students 
will notice — the fact that their loans 
will cost more since they’ll get fewer dis-
counts from less competition,” she said.

However, Coolidge said UCSD 

specific contract.”
The bill would also force the uni-

versity to make public all records of its 
contractual proceedings with individual 
businesses. Each contract that the UC 
system enters into would be recorded 
into a public database available for pub-
lic review at every UC campus.

In addition to this required dis-
closure, the UC system would also 
be required to solicit bids through a 
competitive bidding process at the end 
of every three-year contract term and 
record the results of this process in the 
public database. 

“At the end of the three years, the 
request for proposal would have to 
be put out, and there may or may 
not be multiple bids for the contract,” 
Keigwin said. “But, if there is more 
than one bid, the administration can 
then make the decision that is in the 
best interest of students and taxpayers. 
In this way, the public can hold the 
administration of the UC accountable 
for making sure they make the right 
decisions.”

UC Office of the President spokes-
woman Nicole Savickas said that the 
university is working on improving 
the quality and competitiveness of its 
contract process. 

“The University of California has 
and will continue to work diligently 
to improve its contracting process and 
ensure the highest degree of competi-
tion and best value for the UC system,” 
Savickas said.

The bill will go before the Senate’s 
fiscal committee next week. If approved 
by both the Assembly and the Senate, 
the bill will then go before Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger for approval.

Council Receives Election Suggestions, 
New Leather-Bound Notebooks 

Big-picture issues took center stage at last night’s A.S. Council meeting. The council listened to 
suggestions about revitalizing its elec-
tions and improving campus traditions 
and received a pat on the back from a 
former member.

Earl Warren College senior Mike 
Hirshman spoke during public input 
about the need to remove what he 
described as a roadblock to student 
participation in elections.

“People take this council as seri-
ously as they take elections,” he said. 
Hirshman targeted a rule that prohibits 
A.S. council candidates from campaign-
ing more than two weeks out from 
the conclusion of voting. At a campus 
with 21,000 under-
graduates, he 
said, two weeks of 
campaigning sim-
ply isn’t enough 
to convey a mes-
sage to the student 
body.

Hirshman con-
trasted the rule with efforts that the 
council has made this year to lobby 
administrators against regulating free 
speech in public areas like Price Center 
and Library Walk.

Former Vice President of Finance 
and Resources and UCSD alum 
Conrad Ohashi then took the podium 
to recognize councilmembers who 
were graduating or had served at least 
two years on the council.

“I strongly believe credit should be 
given to anyone who does this for 
more than one year,” Ohashi said as 
he prepared to pass out congratulatory 
Moleskine notebooks to councilmem-
bers and praise their dedication. 

The moment of retrospection came 
as A.S. councilmembers prepared to 
leave their posts to make way for next 
year’s council. They’ll also be leav-
ing the familiar wood-floored realm 

of Price Center Ballroom when they 
change their meeting location to the 
fourth floor of the recently completed 
Price Center East next week.

The meeting was not without some 
regularity, however, as Vice Chancellor 
of Student Affairs Penny Rue made her 
third quarterly visit to the council to 
outline her efforts to expand UCSD’s 
breadth of traditions.

Rue walked the council through a 
presentation titled “Beyond Sun God… 
Creating Possibilities” in an attempt to 
distill the characteristics of successful 
traditions at UCSD and other schools. 
She identified an event’s fun factor, 
memorableness, element of reverence 
and ability to reach across and beyond 

UCSD’s six col-
leges as essential 
to adding to the 
current repertoire 
of Unolympics, 
Sun God, Pancake 
Breakfasts and 
Chancellor’s 5K 
Run-Walk.

Rue also related a few suggestions  
that she had encountered, including a 
camp-out on Library Walk, a freshman 
march to the beach and a campuswide 
effort to break a world record.

During the ensuing question-
and-answer session with Rue, Warren 
Senator Peter Benesch asked her to 
comment on the recent controversy 
surrounding the RIMAC Annex. After 
delivering a fairly diplomatic response 
of her own, Rue yielded to Athletic, 
Recreation and Sports Facility Board 
co-Chair Daniel Palay.

Palay, who confronted council 
opposition to the project at a heat-
ed meeting two weeks ago, sought to 
smooth over some of their objections 
by announcing a plan to form two new 
standing committees with student rep-
resentatives who will oversee the athlet-
ics and sports facilities departments.

students should not struggle to find 
government-subsidized loans, since 
Sallie Mae and other lending com-
panies will continue to offer federal 
loans. The Financial Aid Office also 
features a Preferred Lenders List to 
assist families in choosing loans.

Of the $85 billion educational 
finance market, 61 lending companies 
are no longer participating in fed-
eral loans for the 2008-2009 academic 
year, and 21 lenders will withdraw 
from the private student loans sector.

“There need to be proactive solu-
tions rather than the current reac-
tive solutions that wait until there is 
a potentially destructive crisis upon 
us,” publisher of financial aid Web 
site FinAid.org Mark Kantrowitz said. 
“Congress and the administration are 
looking into solutions to prevent this 
crisis from occurring, which would 
ensure no disruption from obtaining 

student loans.”
Potential solutions circling Capitol 

Hill include allowing lenders to bor-
row multiple federal loan banks in 
exchange for a highly rated student 
loan as collateral, or increasing the 
federal loan limits so that students 
who have been denied a private loan 
will have the opportunity to borrow 
from federal lenders. 

The College Reduction and Access 
Act of 2007 cut the amount of govern-
ment subsidies issued to lenders as 
incentive to provide federal student 
loans, and these finances were reallo-
cated into various financial aids such 
as the increase in the maximum Pell 
Grant — which will reach $5,400 by 
2012 — but their redistribution has 
negatively affected the loan market.

UCSA president Louise Hendrickson 
said. “Monday’s march is only the 
beginning; the state needs to make 
higher education a number-one pri-
ority.”

Schwarzenegger’s proposed cuts 
to public education stem from the 
state’s looming debt, which the 
Office of the Governor estimates at 
around $16 billion. 

In addition to the journey from 
Raley Field to the steps of the state 
capitol, the event included speeches 
from UC, CSU and CCC repre-
sentatives, as well as state poli-
ticians. Lt. Gov. John Garamendi 
marched and spoke at the rally, and 
was joined by Assembly Speaker 
Fabian Núñez (D-Los Angeles), and 
Assembly members Julia Brownley 
(D-Woodland Hills) and Anthony 
Portantino (D-Pasadena).

“Over the last few years, UC 
and CSU student fees have near-
ly doubled,” Garamendi said in a 
speech Monday. Our students can’t 
afford it, and our state can’t afford 
to leave future generations out of 
California’s prosperity.”

According to Stephanie Chan, 
an organizer for Students for 
California’s Future, there were 
between 1,500 and 3,000 marchers 
present at the state capitol.

Though the proposed cuts for the 
state’s three-tier higher education 

system are drastic, their repercus-
sions lie in the next academic year. 
Within the K-12 system, teachers 
are already receiving layoff notices, 
and the 2008-09 school year expects 
a $4.3-billion budget cut. In total, 
cuts across the education systems 
of California will amount to about 
$5.4 billion. 

“In the past, if a budget cut was 
made to the UC, CSU or commu-
nity colleges, the other two were 
able to absorb some of the impact,” 
Chan said. “But now with budget 
cuts across the entire spectrum of 
California’s education system, there 
is no cushion for any part of it.”

Along with general cuts being 
applied across the board, it is like-
ly that the UC system’s internal 
administration will also have to 
make some sacrifices. The Office of 
the President, the UC system’s gov-
erning body, has already proposed 
massive cuts to its administrative 
structure, which would eliminate 20 
percent of its budget and 23 percent 
of its workforce. 

“We realize that tough budget 
times for the state call for our office 
to make some sacrifices,” UCOP 
spokesman Ricardo Vazquez said. 
“However, change was already 
needed.”

Vazquez also spoke in favor of 
the student coalition’s effort on 
Monday.

“Before the Legislature takes a 
vote, they should realize that higher 
education is not an expenditure, 
but an investment,” Vazquez said. 
“Not only does the state’s educa-
tion system currently create over 
three million jobs, but also provides 
the intellectual force for California’s 
future.”

Laura Page, a press representa-
tive for the Office of the Governor, 
said that Schwarzenegger under-
stands that education is a top prior-
ity in the state, and is looking into 
what can be done to provide more 
stable funding for California’s edu-
cation system.

Schwarzenegger’s 2008-09 budget 
proposal requests that 56 percent of 
all general fund expenditures go to 
education, the highest percentage of 
state general fund dollars devoted to 
education in 40 years.

“Schwarzenegger is pushing 
for a reform of the state budget-
ary process so that the education 
in California does not have to go 
on the financial roller coaster ride 
every year,” Page said. “This could 
be done by establishing a financial 
reserve for educational purposes, 
where extra money can be saved in 
it during a good year, in preparation 
for a bad one.”

President of the 
Mount Soledad 
M e m o r i a l 
Association, has 
advocated the 
preservation of 
the cross for sev-
eral years, claim-
ing that the cross 
is only one aspect 
of the memorial. 

“The cross on top of Mount 
Soledad is more than a religious sym-
bol,” Kellogg said. “It is a memorial to 
the veterans who served and died dur-
ing the Korean War, Christian or not.”

Kellogg said it is important to 
include recognized religious symbols 
in monuments, and that the place-
ment of the cross is protected by the 
U.S. Constitution.

“The symbols chosen to honor our

Violates First Amendment
▶ SOLEDAD, from page 1 veterans are part of our freedom of 

expression, and that should be shown 
some tolerance,” he said. “We are not 
upholding one religion over another; 
rather, we’re simply honoring our vet-
erans with religious symbols we are 
familiar with.”

Blair-Loy said 
that despite claims 
that the cross is 
a memorial to all 
veterans, it still 
remains a predom-
inantly religious 
symbol. 

“Not only is it 
unconstitutional 
for the federal gov-
ernment to display 
religious symbols 
on federal prop-
erty, but so is it’s 
obligation to main-

tain such sites using taxpayer dollars,” 
he said.

The federal government obtained 
the cross in 2006 from the City of San 
Diego through statutes of eminent 
domain, with official ownership of the 
property given to the U.S. Department 
of Defense.

If you build it, they will come.” It’s more than a quotable from “Field of Dreams,” it’s a lifelong adage, 
proved true by our own school’s stir-
ring progress of construction at its 
two main hubs: Student Center and 
Price Center. There’s nothing quite 
as satisfying as seeing students finally 
occupying what used to be dirt patch-
es and parking spaces for cranes and 
bulldozers. 

Nearly all the walkways are now 
paved and accessible in Student 
Center. The area’s parking lot, 
previously a cramped clutter of 
fenced-off construction supplies and 
materials, has doubled in size. The 
General Store Co-op, Food Co-op, 
Bike Shop and new Treehouse Lounge 
now see more foot traffic, perhaps the 
healthiest sign of an active campus. 
“The hump” is adorned on its edges 
with concrete landscaping, where 
students now sit between classes to 
absorb a few pages of reading. Others 
catch some sun in Student Center’s 
central courtyard, where the space 

previously jammed up by A.S. Soft 
Reserves is wide open and occupied 
by the occasional sunbather. Studying 
abounds in the student lounge, where 
the attraction could be the plush 
cushion armchairs, warm fireplace or 
occasional waft of Asiatic herbs and 
spices from Hi Thai. Even Porter’s 
Pub is a beneficiary; the normally 
roughshod eatery now boasts 
the cosmetic amenity of graveled 
pathways and a few greening trees.

On May 12, Price Center will 
celebrate the official opening of the 
building’s east atrium, a collection of 
retail restaurants and eateries. Within 
six months, the area will see the 
opening of ____ businesses, including 
Burger King, Tapioca Express and 
____ Grill. The Sunshine Market is 
currently the area’s only attraction, 
but the lounge and sitting areas 
outside the grocery store’s entrance 
are already filling up modestly with 
students. Imagine the hustle-and-
bustle of future lunch hours, when 
the choice of Mexican food doesn’t 

bind you to Rubio’s or when deciding 
on Asian cuisine doesn’t pigeonhole 
you to Panda Express’ three-item 
combo.

To see Student Center and Price 
Center as lively and vibrant as they 
are now, and to foresee the two 
areas soon pulsating with even 

more student life, is the gratifying 
culmination of waiting unknowingly 
for years, frustratingly maneuvering 
around blocked walkways and 
cursing the phrase “weather delays” 
that seemed so ubiquitous to 
administrators. It’s all finally built, 
and we’re coming.

The mad scientist archetype seemed to die off with Dr. Moreau. But the image is 
still very much alive and well in 
the minds of animal-rights pro-
ponents, the most extreme of 
whom have subverted it to make 
a Dr. Frankenstein of university 
researchers. As such, the activists 
have dangerously taken research-
ers to task in a movement that 
sounds like an absurd cross 
between slapstick comedy and 
action thriller. The problems have 
bubbled enough to attract legisla-
tive action, which last week took 
a wise step in a long road to curb 
violence against the university’s 
researching workforce.

The aggressive flurry against 
researchers began in October 
2007, when the Animal Liberation 
Front flooded a UCLA research-
er’s home, only to return again in 
February 2008 with an incendi-
ary device. No one was injured 
by the incidents. But in Santa 
Cruz, the action turned vio-
lent when masked perpetrators 
tried to break into a researcher’s 
home, confronting and attacking 
her husband before finally flee-
ing. A month later, UC Berkeley 
researchers saw their lawns occu-
pied weekly by protesters. The 

specter of animal-rights hecklers 
hangs so heavy that a December 
bomb threat at UCSD was ini-
tially pegged as the work of ALF 
or similar groups — it was later 
found to be a hoax.

Research suffers if researchers 
and administrators are anxious-
ly waiting for the other shoe to 
drop. The basic building blocks 
of the University of California 
are researchers themselves; they 
bring in grants, publish work and 
ultimately brand the UC name 
across the academic world. But 
if a researcher fears the prospect 
of going home to a faceoff with 
a violent zookeeper, the univer-
sity suffers as a whole. As such, 
the state Legislature has moved 
for a wise consolidation with its 
Animal Enterprise Protection Act: 
The university, as “the employer 
of an alleged victim,” would pos-
sess the power to sue as a whole 
even if the victim chooses to drop 
the charges. This portion disables 
activists’ bottom-up method, as 
they try to weaken animal-related 
research by picking off the uni-
versity’s researchers one by one. 
Now, similar action will bring the 
entirety of the university to the 
forefront, a strong deterrent for 
anyone trying to avoid years of 

courtroom wrangling.
But perhaps the most logical 

and impacting solution brought 
by the bill is its coverage of priva-
cy rights. The bill allows the uni-
versity to withhold public infor-
mation it considers to be possible 
tools for harassment. Blatant plas-
tering of home addresses, phone 
numbers and the like on Web 
sites allowed activists the chance 
to bring the fight to researchers’ 
doorstep. The state and univer-
sity has rightly planted its “Keep 
Off ” and animal-rights extrem-
ists would do right to take heed.

ON CAMPUS   — With a bureaucracy as large 
and multifaceted as UCSD’s, it’s often hard 
to single out the individual elements that are 
in the most need of fixing. That is different, 
of course, for the 300 students who were 
abruptly dropped from classes for nonpay-
ment of fees on April 15, who can easily cite 
the overly mechanical, error-ridden Office of 
the Registrar as the squeaky arm that should 
have been greased a long time ago.

At around 2 a.m. last Tuesday, students 
who had not yet paid their Spring Quarter 
e-bills in full received a thoughtful, 100-word 
e-mail beginning with “Dear Student.” It pro-
ceeded to inform them that they had already 
been dropped from their classes, would need 
to pay a $100 late fee to re-enroll, and linked 
them to a PDF file with the reinstatement 
form that would allegedly help them solve 
their problems without issue.

Of course, what would otherwise be a 
simple process when performed by humans 
tends to become complicated when handled 
by computers — especially when the small 
amount of human participation integral to 
the procedure is frustratingly bungled.

To get reinstated, the form required signa-
tures from all of the students’ professors “and/
or” the stamp of each department. At the bot-
tom, it instructed undergraduates to obtain 
departmental approval if filing after fourth 
week. Only after the form was fully signed 
would the student be allowed to pay his or her 
bill and officially re-enroll in classes.

Now, it’s unclear whether the registrar’s 
office has any idea how difficult some pro-
fessors can be to track down, but based on 
its bizarrely stringent policies, that does not 
appear to be the case. Seeing as the office 
oversees when courses are offered, and there-
fore plays a key role in professors’ general 
availability, it would seem like those in charge 
should understand a bit better the hurdle this 

creates. While three-hour classes on one day 
of the week are convenient for some profes-
sors with other jobs or busy schedules, they 
certainly make it challenging to locate them 
on short notice — and that is only the begin-
ning of this ordeal.

Assistant Vice Chancellor of Admissions 
and Enrollment Mae W. Brown said stu-
dents need to add themselves back into their 
classes prior to paying fees because third-
week enrollment is considered late and thus 
requires department approval. While that 
makes sense on its own, it contradicts the 
“and/or” on the form e-mailed out to the 
desperately scrambling students taking laps 
around campus from office hour to office 
hour. 

Many, including this reporter, did not find 
out about this discrepancy until arriving at 
the registrar’s office with four hard-earned 
signatures and a checkbook, only to be told 
by a cashier that the form online was incor-
rect and “too vague.” The real form, she 

said, specified that departmental approval 
was necessary in all cases.

After a grudging second trip around cam-
pus, I was then redirected back to the Student 
Services Complex to pay the bogus $100 late 
fee — $50 of which is for late enrollment 
and $50 is for late registration, according to 
Brown.

“Registration in a quarter is a two-step 
process; students enroll in classes, but they
are not officially registered until they pay 
fees,” she said.

So, by that logic, students pay a fee in 
order to pay a fee. Apparently, they also pay a 
fee for forgetting to pay a fee on the original 
fee. Somewhere in northern California, the 
UC Board of Regents is laughing manically 
while its bank account becomes engorged 
with unnecessary taxes and students’ tears.

While it is not clear what the fee is actu-
ally for, any attempt to label it “processing” 

I started out like many a Triton freshman: an eager biochemistry major who studied hard in his 
CHEM 6A class, flirted with the idea 
of medical school and worked as an 
animal caretaker in a lab.

But CHEM 6A became CHEM 
6B, and my plans took a hit when I 
got the first C of my life after studying 

for almost 11 straight hours the night 
before the final, sans Adderall. Even 
though I didn’t really find the subject 
of chemistry particularly exhilarating 
and delta-H problems haunted my 
dreams (seriously), I begrudgingly 
pressed on because I knew that all bio 
majors have to complete a very spe-
cific list of major requirements with 
the obvious inclusion of, you guessed 
it, chemistry.

Next up came more pre-med class-
es: physics and organic chemistry. To 
say the least, I hated both of them 
— a lot. Organic chemistry mecha-
nisms look like Satanic symbols and, 
honestly, who the hell gives a rat’s 
ass about how fast a stupid toy car 
rolls down a ramp? Not me, that’s for 
sure. In fact, I hated physics so much 
that I decided not to take PHYS 1C 
— waves, optics and modern physics 
— during Spring Quarter of sopho-
more year, instead saving it for, as you 
may have guessed again, now.

By some fluke, I enrolled in and 
successfully completed physics lab 
two years ago without enrolling in 
lecture, so don’t believe it when they 
tell you on TritonLink that they 
automatically drop you if you’re not 
simultaneously enrolled in both the 
lecture and lab classes. Suck on that, 
physics department.

I’ll get back to physics later, but 
it was also at this time that I started 
to become disillusioned with my lab 
job. The research going on inside was 
extremely interesting and involved 
salamanders whose entire limbs grow

would certainly be a gross exaggera-
tion: Re-enrollment in classes took 
approximately five minutes, while 
the amount of time it took to ready 
the correct form bordered on hours. 
I sincerely hope at least some of the 
$10/minute fee made it back to the 
friendly gentleman who did the actu-
al work of typing my course codes 
back into the computer system.

The problem appears to lie less 
in the details and more in the auto-
mated system as a whole. Why is the 
automatic drop even necessary in 
the first place? The university has 
any number of ways to twist stu-

dents’ arms to pay their fees, includ-
ing withholding degrees and putting 
a freeze on their campus spending. 
It’s clear that the one automated 
warning sent on April 7 — which 
can very easily be buried under all 
of the university’s spam — didn’t 
alert enough students to the prob-
lem in time, since Brown admitted 
the number of auto-dropped stu-
dents rose 15 percent from Spring 
Quarter 2007.

If UCSD entrusts the power-
ful responsibility of coordinating 
enrollment to a computer, admin-
istrators must ensure that the tasks 
delegated to humans are actually 

done correctly. While the re-enroll-
ment form has been updated online 
since the original e-mail, no apol-
ogy or even notice was sent to those 
still trying to locate their elusive 
professors. 

Technological streamlining of 
menial work has its benefits, espe-
cially for such a large university 
— but it’s something that needs to 
be done carefully and thoughtfully, 
without policies that gouge students 
unnecessarily and kick them while 
they’re down.

back after being amputated (shout 
out to Dr. Gardiner, who was actu-
ally one of the coolest guys I could 
have ever wanted to work for), but 
working with boring-ass, cookie-cut-
ter undergraduate student assistants 
who were only doing time in the lab 
to get into medical school started tak-
ing its toll. So I resigned my position, 
never to see a dimwitted axolotl grin 
again. (Look it up.)

I started thinking about why I 
was still a bio major. After briefly 
considering medical school freshman 
year I realized I 
had no desire (at 
all, actually) to 
be around blood, 
needles, bones, 
open wounds, 
diseases, confused 
old people and 
that distinct medi-
cal establishment 
chemical smell. 

But as a bio 
major, being in 
classes filled to 
capacity with all 
these pre-people 
(pre-med, pre-
vet, pre-dental, pre-pharmacy, pre-
optometry, pre-my asshole, blah blah) 
was definitely discouraging. To be 
sure, I can’t hate on all pre-meds, as 
some of my good friends here will be 
in medical school one day (maybe), 
but a lot of you people really need to really need to really
lighten up. 

Seriously, stop looking shocked that 
I’m speaking to you in lecture and get 
some goddamn people skills, because 
one day you robots might need to tell 
someone that a beloved family mem-
ber is dying. Also, I never want to hear 
“If I don’t get into med school, I’ll try 
dental school” or anything of similar 

Biology and Pre-Med? 
Accept My Condolences
▶ WORD, from page 4 nature ever again. This just proves you 

people are money-grubbing machines 
who care more about status than actu-
ally about helping people. Plus, I know 
that you guys all cheat on the physics 
labs, too.

These super-competitive classes 
were starting to make me to forget why 
I liked to study biology. But then came 
classes that I liked: animal behavior, 
ecology, genetics — classes that made 
me sigh with relief when I sat down 
in lecture because I no longer had to 
worry about vicious pre-meds rip-
ping my throat out if I asked them 

to help me with a 
homework ques-
tion. After chok-
ing down chem-
istry and physics, 
my major actually 
became enjoyable 
again.

But all that 
has returned 
this quarter with 
waves, optics and 
modern physics. 
Like a stubborn 
itch, it’s re-expos-
ing me to the hor-
rors of the pre-

med world, not to mention that I find 
sound waves the opposite of interest-
ing. The professor, like me, realized 
the med-student farce on the first 
day when he jokingly acknowledged 
that many students in the lecture hall 
“think they’re entering medicine.”

So I say to all you people who 
made me agonize over my lower-divi-
sion bio classes here because a lot of 
you aren’t actually human: chill out. 
Honestly, you’re annoying to those of 
us in biology who are actually doing 
it because we find the study of life 
interesting. Oh yeah, good luck on 
your MCATs.

Animal-Rights Issue Needs 
Wider Ethical Perider Ethical Perider Ethical P speerspeer ctive

Dear Editor,
The article “Bill Aims to Protect 

Researchers” reported a new law is 
being sought to allow UC officials 
to mandate stronger protection for 
researchers against the “threats” of 
animal activists (making nonviolent 
harassment a misdemeanor) and to 
withhold information about animal 
researchers from the public. In the 
article, the UC Vice President for 
Research and Graduate Studies 
Steven Beckwith equated animal-
rights activists with terrorists. Yet, 
strikingly little information was 
given on the “very important medical 
research” that was being protested or 
the types of animal experimentation 
involved. The Guardian’s subsequent 
article, “Of Mice and Men,” 
suggested they were conducting 
“painful addition experiments” and 
attaching “steel coils onto the eyes 
of primates.” Last week, the directors 
of the Animal Welfare Program, 
the Animal Care Program and the 
UCSD Police Department sent an 
e-mail to warn UCSD researchers 
against “animal rights extremists.” In 
this research-driven university, such 
a polarized view point of animal 
experimentation vs. animal rights 
might be expected. I suggest wider 
perspectives are warranted within 
an academic institution seeking to 
develop future leaders of a wiser 
society. 

It is Animal Cruelty and Human 
Violence Awareness Week, an 
appropriate time to present a broader 
view of this issue. Animal-rights 
activists are diverse and numerous, 
many of whom are highly educated, 
professional citizens, seeing common 
links between animal welfare and 
human welfare. Their organizations 
include the Humane Society, 
the Physicians Committee for 
Responsible Medicine, the American 
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty 
to Animals, the American Anti-
Vivisection Society, the Alternatives 
Research and Development 
Foundation and People for the 
Ethical Treatment of Animals. These 
organizations share the common 
assertion that animals are intelligent, 
sentient beings, worthy of humane 
treatment and they communicate 
their messages peacefully.

A primary argument against 
experimentation on animals is that 
it’s unethical. Other less obvious 
but notable faults are that it is 
inefficient, unnecessary and in 
some cases ineffective. Every minute 
219 animals are killed in U.S. labs, 
according to www.peta.org. As an 
undergraduate at UCSD, I worked 
in a cancer research lab in Urey Hall 
where mice were killed by the dozens 
every day. Tumors were induced and 
collected from some of these animals 
that suffocated in dry ice, but not 
all were useful for experiments. A 
graduate student complained that 
the professor required him to kill 
mice, not for experiments, but 
because he did not want to pay the 
$0.05 per day it cost to keep each one 
alive. Yes, there are regulations on 
animal research, but there are also 
violations and irreverent decisions 
made based on unregulated personal 
ethics. In the ethics training offered 
to researchers, referenced in your 
article, animal welfare seems to be 
little more than an afterthought.

Gandhi said, “The greatness of 
a nation and its moral progress can 
be judged by the way its animals are 

treated.” I don’t fear individuals who 
demand a more ethical society in the 
name of those who cannot demand 
it themselves. Rather, I much more 
greatly fear a society where such 
demands cease to be made.

Government Fails to
Enforce Animal Rights

Dear Editor,
Thank you for your article on the 

controversy over animal experimen-
tation (“Of Mice and Men,” April 
21). It’s a tragic day for California 
taxpayers when the UC system 
responds to public outcry over the 
suffering of animals by proposing to 
curtail free speech and to limit access 
to records on animal use. It would 
be more useful for the UC to deal 
with the problems within its labo-
ratories. Numerous federal reports 
indicate that facilities routinely flout 
even the minimal protections of the 
Animal Welfare Act, the only fed-
eral law that provides protection for 
animals in laboratories. According 
to multiple federal audits, even this 
law, which deals mainly with caging 
and husbandry issues, is not being 
adequately enforced, and it entirely 
excludes rats, mice and birds.

A scathing 2005 audit report 
published by the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture Office of the Inspector 
General shows that Institutional 
Animal Care and Use Committees 
— oversight committees that are 
charged with approving proposed 
experiments and ensuring that laws 
and regulations are followed — are 
utterly failing to carry out their 
responsibilities. As a result, sick ani-
mals go without veterinary care, 
animals used in invasive surger-
ies do not receive sufficient pain 
relief and extremely sick animals 
are denied humane euthanasia. An 
astounding 29 percent, nearly a 
third, of oversight committees are 
failing to ensure that experiment-
ers look for alternatives to painful 
procedures on animals, as they’re 
required to do.

The failure of IACUCs to ensure 
that the AWA is enforced results in 
immense suffering for animals used 
in sometimes painful, often stressful 
and ultimately lethal experiments. 
UC officials need to stop pushing 
for legislation that curtails freedom 
of speech and information and focus 
instead on fixing the mess created 
by the arrogance and carelessness of 
its animal experimenters.

THE BEST SONGS 

IN HIATUS 
THIS WEEK

too much foreplay frays stilted romance yarn, “my blueberry nights”

Renowned Chinese director Wong Kar Wai makes his first foray into American cinema with “My Blueberry Nights,” a sweet but unnoticeable blip 
on the radar of Wong’s resume, which usually 
produces heated, sultry operatic cinema that 
sweat the palms and pump the heart. 

But “My Blueberry Nights,” Wong’s first 
American full-length feature, fails at achiev-
ing either, slamming together a motley act-
ing crew that limply wades through scenes. 
Veterans Jude Law, Rachel Weisz and Natalie 
Portman make memorable showings as 
worldly, engaging characters, but Wong fails 
to apply to them the milky, breathless buzz 
he haloed his other films’ characters with 
— “Blueberry Nights” is a mashup that was 
never meant to be.

Maybe it’s the leading lady that sinks 
the entire ship. Pop/jazz singer Norah Jones 
plays Lizzie, a wide-eyed wanderer that semi-
woos Jeremy (Law) in New York before going 
on the U.S. waitressing circuit, serving joints 
as far as Memphis and Las Vegas in an effort 
to fully shed the heartbreaking memories she 
left in the Big Apple. 

Jones wears the cutesy role as lightly as 
cashmere, smoothed to the point that it’s 
meant to go unnoticed. Her muted aura slips 
even further under, as Wong’s glossy direc-
tion and imagery massages the screen with  
neon lights and glimmering colors.

Lizzie and Jeremy postcard each other as 

she journeys, dangling a fat piece of hopeful 
bait that Wong will consummate the pair’s 
eye-fucking at the beginning of the film. In 
fact, most of “Blueberry Nights” is a tease, 
stringing Lizzie job to job, throwing hapless 
characters in her way as she flaps about try-
ing to find some modicum of emotion. It’s 
twice the foreplay, half the sex.

Thirty minutes into the film, Wong adds 
some much-needed spice with Sue Lynne 
(Weisz), a hot-blooded Southern belle that 
wrings her ex-husband (a gracefully sullen 
David Strathairn) around her finger before 
he drunk-drives into a tree. 

Sue Lynne proceeds to hide in the bottle 
and confide in waitress Lizzie, whom she 
spouts pearls and nuggets to about love’s 
dark recesses. Weisz handles the twangy 
accent with a beautiful twitter, even as she 
lays face down on the bar counter in drunken 
stupors. Lizzie leaves tending bar to Sue 
Lynne for casino waitressing in Las Vegas, 
where she meets Leslie (Portman), another 

spitfire beauty.
Wong trashes up Portman for the poker-

playing Leslie, butchering and bleaching her 
hair before slapping on hoop earrings for an 
all-out, hoed-up look. Portman plays the part 
admirably, throwing around sizeable hand-
fuls of sass that liven an otherwise fizz-less 
film.

With “2046” Wong mastered his lush style 
with a sweeping look and arresting score. 
“Blueberry Nights” succeeds with the first 
but falters with the latter. The film proudly 
wears Wong’s visual style of blurred lights 
and smeared neons. But the soundtrack 
proves too sparse, employing Cat Power for 
an underwhelming match with an already 
subdued set of characters (the musician 
also makes a modest performance as Katya, 
Jeremy’s old flame). 

The intense, fever-filled pitch of Wong’s 
previous films is neutered in “Blueberry 
Nights,” where everyone is sweet but nobody 
is sweet together. But it’s no fault to Wong; 
Jones falls terribly flat as an actress, whereas 
Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung steamed up 
the screen in “In the Mood for Love.” 

As a romantic drama, “Blueberry Nights” 
commands a snug, cozy look at broken love 
and melted hearts. And although Wong sus-
tains the somber, despondent alienation that 
he skillfully pours over all his films, this one 
lacks the sexual bite that makes his works so 
engaging.

MODULAR INTERSCOPE

H ard Candy is an apt title for the latest evolution of everyone’s favorite yoga-bending, Kabbalah-praying, sex-oozing, controversy-kindling 
queen of pop: Madonna. But maybe she confused 
meditation with mindlessness because the empty-
headed lyrics and buzzing synthpop of Hard Candy 
is a lot like buying one of those generic bags of 
gummy bears: good for a little sugar, but nothin’ 
special. Where the famously shameless superstar has 
self-accredited production rights to her hits since 
1986, we find ol’ Madge stepping down from her 
high horse and handing over the reigns to big-name 
producers in a desperate attempt to salvage what 
2006’s Confessions on a Dance Floor destroyed.

And it shows. Madonna’s deity status gives her 
the freedom to pluck the most highly craved treats 
of the industry at whim, and for her first single 
she chose two of its most nutritionally devoid stars 
— Timbaland and Mouseketeer JT — to lend her 
newfound pop relevance. Alas, “4 Minutes” is a little 
too relevant; the rehashed beats from Timbaland’s 
Shock Value and marching band din drown out her 
characteristic sass, and any anonymous face could 
be auto-tuned to fill its tired margins.

So why not Britney, or Nelly, or Gwen-ny? Well, 
as Her Madgesty informs us on “She’s Not Me,” 
while other wannabes might “steal [her] looks and 
lingerie,” none can replicate the true divinity of 
Madonna. Unfortunately, the song itself (complete 
with whisper-breathing and electro-pinging) owes 
more to Pharrell’s styling than personal talent, prov-
ing that even repulsive amounts of money can’t 
make the songstress special. On another Pharrell-
produced track, “Candy Store,” Madonna invites 
us to “come into [her] store,” because her “sugar is 
sweet.” You gotta give the hardbody credit; she’s a 
midlife sex symbol and still pretty sweet — just not 
any sweeter than every other crooner on the current 
MTV circuit.

Clubs around the world will undoubtedly 
embrace Hard Candy, but as far as “transformation” 
goes, Madonna might be getting too old to confront 
another identity crisis. Relying on the ’80s synth 
that made her a lipstick idol and on the guys who 
are paid to manufacture pop princesses, our favorite 
diva fails to achieve little more than mediocrity.

I t’s been almost four years since psyche-delic Australian electro duo the Presets began serving up hard, pulse-pounding, 
dance-all-night beatlines, and their newest 
release, Apocalypso, soldiers on right where 
2005’s Beams left off: in your face.

The Presets had a lot to live up to with 
their sophomore attempt after racking up a 
huge clubgoer fan base with sweaty mind-
fucks like “I Go Hard, I Go Home” and a 
remixed Beams re-release featuring head-
pounding collaborations from fellow thump-
ing electro acts like Simian Mobile Disco, 
Digitalism and Midnight Juggernauts. But 
judging from Apocalypso’s No. 1 debut on 
the Australian charts, coupled with a sold-
out concert tour, the boys are back with a 
snarling, infectiously danceable vengeance, 
and it’s easy to see why.

Dirty bass lines and gritty beats ignite 
opener “Kicking and Screaming,” an elec-
tronic storm that sets the pace for the 
album’s remaining 10 songs. To put it sim-
ply, when Julian Hamilton’s baritone finally 

slashes the relentless synth verses of the 
almost desperately built-up intro with a 
piercing bark of “When I was young, I col-
lected my heroes,” it will be impossible to 
not drop everything you’re doing and dance 
like you know how. 

As the jarring rollercoaster ride of 
“Kicking and Screaming” ends, you’ll be 
dazed, grinning and gasping, but instead 
of letting you rest, the duo immediately 
blankets the dance floor with the industrial, 
almost ragged, rhythm of head-thumper 
“My People.” And it just keeps going right 
on down to the last song, the soft but 
dynamic “Anywhere,” which features filthy 
lyrics (“Deeper, I know you want it deeper”) 
plastered over a steady barrage of puls-
ing beatlines. Add to the mix songs like 
“Aeons,” which ditches the vocals and relies 
on a series of euphoric sounds to lull listen-
ers into deep relaxation, and the Presets 
prove why they are electro masters.

Critical Hit!

MICROSOFT,

i'm breaking 
up with you

DEAR MICROSOFT,Congratulations! You’ve once 
again beat Sony, your biggest competi-
tor, to crown the Xbox 360 as the sec-
ond best-selling console for the month 
of March. 

The decision to drop the 360’s 
European entry price was nothing 
short of brilliant, garnering you a 
whole 2.8-percent sales increase. In 
fact, where you’ve sold more, Sony 
actually lost units, 23,800 specifically. 
Clearly, your marketing and financial 
strategy is paying off. 

While I’m sure you would’ve liked 
to be the number one platform holder, 
the Nintendo Wii is an unstoppable 
powerhouse, selling a good 459,000 
units more than you. You’ve success-
fully maintained your position as the 
dominant high-definition console. 
Well done! Amid your success, I just 
have one question to ask: 

Microsoft, why do you hate me? 
Actually, let me rephrase that. Why 

do you hate your customers? Your 
marketing ploys are working, and 
many a night I dream of having one 
of your darlings in my bedroom and 
fiddling its sticks with my thumbs. But 
I’m not stupid. You may have fooled the

THE CAB wants you to 
know they aren’t your typical 
indie band. As their Myspace hit, 
“I’ll Run,” says, you should “have 
a little faith.” That’s exactly what 
Pete Wentz did. He chose to sign 
the relatively unknown band 
from Las Vegas to his impressive 
Decaydance label when the Cab 
had only one demo up on their 
Myspace page. With Wentz’s 
backing, the band has been able 
to bypass the typical blockages 
facing most start-up bands and 
have been on tour extensively 
before the release of their debut 
album, Whisper War — which 
features Fall Out Boy’s Patrick 
Stump and Panic at the Disco’s  
Brendon Urie. 

THE GUARDIAN: Where are you 
now?

ALEX DELEON: I’m in Northern 
California, getting ready for a long 
drive out to Colorado during our 
one day off [of tour]. 

G: So how did you start out 
singing? Did you put the band 
together?

AD: No – I didn’t know 
I could sing. I never 
had training or 
anything, but my 
dad and gramdma 
were professional 
singers. I was 
too shy, but Cash 

[Colligan — the Cab’s bass player] 
supposedly would hear me singing 
in the car when we would blast 
music and was like, “You’re good! 

Why aren’t you singing for our 
band?”

G: Tell me a little bit about how 

Lynn Hershman-Leeson offers 
an off-the-cuff stab at experimental 
documentary “Strange Culture,” 
detailing the shocking and tragic 
arrest of artist Steve Kurtz. The 
night of his wife’s death (portrayed 
in flashback by Oscar-winner 
Tilda Swinton), Kurtz finds himself 
accused of bioterrorism by the 
FBI on account of his offbeat and 
somewhat controversial artwork. 

What follows is a seamless hybrid of 
actor reenactments and interviews, 
chronicling Kurtz’s tragic tale 
— which included the government 
impounding of his work, house, 
even his wife’s body — and the 
subsequent trial alongside friend 
and collaborator Robert Ferrell. 
“Strange Culture” makes its San 
Diego debut tonight at the Museum 
of Contemporary Art. (CM)

Tokyo Police Club
■ Elephant Shell
SADDLE CREEK

T hree surefire rules for an instant hit band, brought to you by Tokyo Police Club: first, handclaps; second, gang back-
ground vocals; third, nonsensical (but cool-
sounding) band name. These four Canadian 
youngsters carry those aesthetics to the LP 
arena with a caffeinated emo-Strokes burst on 
debut Elephant Shell, a more subdued singles 
collection than their previous work (all six-
teen minutes of it). 

It all starts with perfect opener “Centennial,” 
a taut reminder that singer Dave Monks takes 
effective song arcs and rides them for every 
drop of indie chic they contain. 

Then we get “In A Cave,” an image-heavy 
tune about sci-fi time travel and Romance 
that best encompasses the band’s maturation 
into a restrained pop beast. These three-for-
three ends with “Graves,” a punchy assault 
that blasts you with bite-sized hooks sheathed 
in synthetic oohs and insistent guitar.

And from then on the Club starts to 
lose its footing. Monks decided to adopt an 
even more nasally geek-tinge to his vocal 

inflections this time around, and they fur-
ther tarnish tween-girl friendly tracks “Juno” 
and “Tessellate.” In case anyone didn’t know 
already, the word tessellate roughly means 
“to form or arrange in a checkered or mosaic 
pattern”; when you add the phrase “broken 
hearts” to that, you’ve got yourself a heart-on-
sleeve nerdgasm worth a wince or two.

Besides the aforementioned tracks’ ques-
tionable lyrics and irritating delivery, the rest 
of the record sparkles with its huge percus-
sion, Monks’ everything-is-a-chorus approach 
to songwriting and goofy keymaster Graham 
Wright’s tasteful choice of synth tones. 

None of the cuts reach the frantic bliss 
of “Be Good” or the pop-shock newness 
that “Nature of the Experiment” represented, 
but “Your English Is Good” and “Graves” 
come close. Still, I say bring back the Albert 
Hammond Jr. riffs, dry your eyes and speed 
up your shit for the next one; we don’t want 
another Voxtrot on our hands.

recordings

C ringing at her incomprehensibly disas-trous fashion faux pas — a bulky baby-blue windbreaker with spurts of hideous 
red synthetic fur — you can only hope that 
Robyn’s plea for ridicule ends on the cover 
of her self-titled album. Regrettably, five 
minutes into the album leaves you wondering 
how this Europop singer was ever marketed 
as the world’s next high-“E”-albeit-equally-
badly-dressed Christina Aguilera.

Merely judging from the track’s title, 
“Konichiwa Bitches” is a ridiculously unin-
telligible and downright embarrassing appro-
priation of Gza’s catchphrase on a played-out 
“Chappelle’s Show” skit. Although the jerky 
synthesized beats might sway some analog-
hungry electronic fans, Robyn’s alleged lyri-
cal aptitude is nowhere to be found in “You 
wanna rumble in space / I put my laser on 
stun / And on tha north pole I’ll ice you son 
… / You wanna thrilla in Manilla / You’ll 
be killer bee stung.” You don’t have to be a 
feminine activist to pout your lips with the 
thought of Robyn’s tragic rendition of pop 

culture’s latest stereotypical dumb blonde. 
Fortunately, Robyn’s cover of the 

Teddybears’ dancehall jam “Cobrastyle” is 
considerably tolerable enough to redeem the 
Stockholm pop singer from her humiliatingly 
distasteful tracks. Like most of the album’s 
songs, its beat is the love child of Norwegian 
pop singer Annie’s “Heartbeat” melodic con-
fections and Swedish siblings the Knife’s 
warped-space/time-continuum trance. You 
can also applaud Robyn’s offhand charm in 
“Bum Like You,” a contradictory retake of 
TLC’s “No Scrubs”’ she-woman mentality 
(“Your car’s a dump and you’re broke / but 
that’s all right … / I would knit you mittens 
and make you pie”).

If you’re just looking to hit up a sweaty 
dance club, you’ll appreciate Robyn’s sugary-
sweet sound; otherwise, you’ll find that her 
less-than-impressive lyrical material has not 
quite reached maturation and is as tacky as 
her revolting fashion-disaster ensemble.

The Dodos
■ Visiter
FRENCH KISS

W hile Meric Long and Logan Kroeber of the Dodos will certainly reel you in with rhythmic drumming, vocal chants 
and atmospheric psych-folk-pop reminiscent 
of Animal Collective, the duo’s second album 
Visiter won’t make a lasting impression on 
voracious aficionados of the genre. 

It may be too harsh to judge the San 
Francisco-based duo’s second work as a 
“paper-mache Mephistopheles,” but there is 
an undeniable hollowness that encompasses 
the collective songs. One would think the 
screeching bellows and soft whispers of Long 
and his bluesy guitar, dynamically entangled 
with Kroeber’s relentless drumming, would 
create a psych-folk masterpiece. Instead, we 
have an album that falls short of making an 
impact. 

Songs like “Ashley” and “God?” are pris-
tine moments where the dusty Visiter is 
allowed to take off its drab coat and shine. 
Long invites you to take a closer look at 
the dynamic relationship built among ambi-

ent electronics, tambourines, steel-stringed 
acoustic guitars and thematically rudimen-
tary vocal chants, but the Dodos only get so 
far with their setup. 

The album reveals an emptiness beneath 
what seems at first a lush and promising ride. 
Visiter may keep you listening through its 
first run, but it won’t prompt your finger to 
hit repeat. 

Kroeber’s drumming can oftentimes be 
too domineering, noisily conflicting with the 
intricate complexities permeating through 
Long’s fingerpicking. The inevitable result 
of trying to do too many things at once, cre-
ates a clash between Kroeber and Long that 
Visiter seems to suffer from. 

Perhaps this band must closely re-exam-
ine the symbiotic relationship between the 
drums and guitar, so central in its musical 
strengths and weaknesses, or meet the same 
evolutionary fate as its ill-chosen moniker.

Elbow
■ The Seldom Seen Kid
GEFFEN

S ome people find it unfortunate for a band to name themselves after a joint covered with darkened skin in need of exfoliation, but doesn’t the name at least 
intrigue you? Don’t you wonder what a band with a name 
like Elbow sounds like? Elbow conjures up thoughts of 
“elbow grease” or “elbow room,” but what would spacious 
workroom sound like? One word: divine.

However, upon first listen to The Seldom Seen Kid, the 
Manchesterian boys’ fourth effort, one can’t help but ask, 
“The hell is this crap?” Yes, Elbow usually sucks the first 
time through but the band slowly reveals itself and rewards 
those who visit often. It will accidentally play while your 
iPod is set to random and you’ll say, “Oh, what do we have 
here?” Once you’ve sloughed off a couple of layers of dead, 
fast-to-judge epidermis, you can’t help but keep going back 
to that smooth, polished joint of yours.

The Seldom Seen Kid opens with a track that’s hard to 
love, the one that signals the initial turnoff. “Starlings” 
starts off in “A Day in the Life” chaotic disarray and then 

cuts itself up into an electronic beat. But don’t fret, the 
album only gets better and better. “Mirrorball” is a trip-
hopped dam that when eventually breached, releases a 
flood of lush strings to accompany singer Guy Garvey’s 
mature vocals. “Grounds for Divorce” contains the line 
that the album’s title is taken from; the Real seldom seen 
kid was an old friend of the band who died suddenly a 
couple of years back. 

“Divorce” is the album’s gem, stomping through the 
track’s entirety, sounding Beck-like with filtered vocals 
accented by banjo twangs and a scraping washboard. “The 
Fix” draws from the soundtracks of campy Halloween 
and Tim Burton flicks with all the sliding guitars lost in a 
vibrating haze, featuring Richard Hawley of Pulp fame on 
guest vocals. The Seldom Seen Kid reveals its majesty and 
soft skin in a way that will leave you glowing both inside 
and out once you give it the attention it deserves.

Fleet Foxes
■ Sun Giant
SUB POP

A recently broken five-piece out of the Pacific Northwest, Fleet Foxes certainly pushes the envelope when it comes to being classified as indie rock after their second EP, Sun 
Giant. The term is unabashedly broad, but Fleet Foxes barely 
qualify as rock with their soft and slow blend of meandering 
guitar chords and sentimental lyrics, with a generous helping of 
old-fashioned folk melodies and dreamy harmonies that sound 
vaguely like church organs. Fleet Foxes call their own music 
“baroque harmonic pop jams,” a phrase that likely means noth-
ing to the average listener unschooled in technical music terms 
and even less concerned with the dilemma of accurately labeling 
their addition to the genre.

The song titles (like “Drops in the River” and “Innocent 
Son”), along with the folksy lyrics, underwhelming tone and 
even the band’s MySpace page all mesh to form a highly rural 
and agrarian musical landscape. The instrumentation frequently 
retreats far into the background, occasionally vanishing entirely 

in favor of showcasing the amplified and likely synthesized 
lyrical intonations. Even when the pace picks up — a rare occur-
rence — it rarely ventures beyond a trot, preferring to stay within 
the confines of its laid-back rhythm and tone.

Despite its tendency to lazily weave toward being soporific 
instead of relaxing, Sun Giant is cleverly constructed to flaunt 
Fleet Foxes’ broad audience appeal. While college-age stu-
dents and especially the younger generation may be less than 
impressed at their comparatively lethargic sound — perhaps 
making mainstream success in the near future elusive — those 
who embrace a diversity of musical tastes will enjoy Fleet Foxes’ 
refreshingly low-key style. The band’s execution and integration 
of elements from soft rock, pop, bluegrass, gospel and even New 
Age has the potential to gather listeners from across the tonal 
spectrum.

average buyer, but I’m well aware of 
your abysmal customer service. Don’t 
act like you don’t know, Microsoft. 
I’ve heard the stories, and I’ve wit-
nessed some of them firsthand. How 
long do you think you can sustain 
your lead in the market? It’s obvious 
you’ll never achieve Nintendo’s sta-
tus, but do you really think you can 
keep beating Sony with price drops? 
You really think you can keep selling 
units when Sony starts lowering their 
prices?

You know, I just want compe-
tent hardware. I want a console that 
doesn’t sound like an anally probed 
cow every time I turn it on. Do you 
realize that while the Playstation 3 
purrs like a sensitive kitty cat, the 
Xbox 360 howls like a cracked-out 
mastodon. 

But let’s assume I’m being a bit 
harsh. Perhaps the discomfort of 
the system’s heavy breathing is only 
a small sacrifice for some greater 
enjoyment. Then again, assuming I 
somehow numb myself of the sound, 
I only have about a year’s worth 
of playtime before I come across 
the “red ring of death,” the bane of 
every early adopter’s existence, the 
ongoing joke proving your system’s 
consistent fallibility. 

Your only response is a warranty 
extension and the creation of an 
Xbox Replacement Service. Do you 
really think warranty extensions and 
increased customer service will sat-
isfy your target audience? Microsoft, 
here’s what we really want: a reliable 
system. That’s it. Has your mind 
been blown?

But I understand. It costs less 
to extend warranties and expand 
customer service. It’s a tough finan-
cial move to recall systems and to 
reproduce 360s with solid and stable 
hardware. So perhaps I am being 
a bit too critical. Perhaps I should 

judge the quality of the platform 
by the competency of your proud 
online services. 

Unfortunately, even on Xbox 
Live you consistently remain igno-
rant of your audience. PC gaming 
has always offered free multiplayer 
services, but your online gaming 
initiative has gamers paying for ser-
vices on both the X360 and the PC. 

How can we ever appreciate pay-
ing for services that we know are 
supposed to be free? While I can 
appreciate your extensive library of 
original and remade arcade games, 
your paying system is absurd. Why 
do I have to pay more money just to 
buy one specific item? I don’t own a 
360, but when I want to throw down 
two bucks to play a song for Rock 
Band on my friend’s system, I want 
to spend exactly $2 for the item, not 
$5 on 500 points. What the fuck am 
I going to do with 300 extra points?

Do you understand why I’m 
upset, Microsoft? I truly want a 360. 
I dream of fondling its smooth cur-
vatures in the palms of my hand. But 
you’re making it hard for me. You 

were never supposed to enter the 
gaming industry, but I supported 
you. 

I loved your platform’s clunky yet 
attractive predecessor, and I wanted 
to support the sequel. I really did. 
But I’m convinced that you hate 
me. You fail to cater to my needs, 
and all you do is take and take and 
take. I can’t handle this one-sided 
relationship. 

Do I want a copy of Bioshock? 
You bet I do. Do I want to play 
Gears of War 2? You have no idea. 

But I’ll pass. I look forward to cre-
ative and original independent titles 
in WiiWare that Xbox Live Arcade 
could never hope to replicate, and 
what I can’t find on the Wii I’ll find 
solace in the PS3. 

Perhaps when you finally hit 
mass-market value, when your sys-
tem sells for as much as the Wii, I’ll 
reconsider. But you’ve truly broken 
my heart, Microsoft, and it won’t be 
easy to repair.

combining to issue 11 walks to the 
surging Seawolves. Sonoma State took 
a 4-2 lead after both offenses got on the 
board in the first inning and added nine 
more runs in the fourth through eighth 
innings to cruise to the 13-2 win.

In the nightcap of the doubleheader, 
UCSD jumped out to an early 4-0 lead 
after a four-run second inning, but saw 
it vanish as the Seawolves came back 
with five runs in the top of the third. 
The Tritons added a run in the bottom 
half to even the score at five each, but 
Sonoma State had another big inning 
in the fourth, scoring four more runs to 
take a 9-5 lead. UCSD would add one 
more run in the fifth inning but would 
be unable to muster anything more, 
falling by a final of 9-6.

“I just think overall we were incon-
sistent throughout the weekend,” 
O’Brien said. “We showed signs of 
greatness but if we expect to go deep in 
the playoffs, we’re going to need to be 
much more consistent.”

With the win in the finale, however, 
UCSD improves to 36-11 overall and 
20-8 in conference play. And although 
the Tritons have only eight games to 
make up the difference in the standings 
with the Seawolves, the two four-game 
series are against Cal State Monterey 
Bay and San Francisco State University, 
the bottom two teams in the CCAA 
standings. The Gators are currently 
last, having won only one conference 
game, while the Otters sit in ninth with 
a CCAA record of 7-25.

[First place] is our focus,” O’Brien 
said. “We want to finish at the top and 
I think our guys are hungry and I think 
they’re starting to taste it.”

Athletic Union basketball. The AAU 
program, both prevalent and competi-
tive in Northern California, served as a 
precursor for Allard’s decision to attend 
and play basketball at Archbishop Mitty 
High School, as opposed to a public 
school where he might have been able 
to post better on-court stats against 
lesser opponents.

“Playing against better competition 
is only going to make you better, espe-
cially when you’re fighting for a spot 
everyday,” Allard said.

As one of Carr’s few returning play-
ers, Allard would join his teammates 
in a “sink-or-swim” situation that year, 
in which the new coach was able to 
mold the players and all of those get-
ting playing time were, for the most 
part, inexperienced at the collegiate 
level. Senior guard Andrew Hatch, 
the California Collegiate Athletic 
Association Freshman of the Year in 
2004-05, remembers Allard during a 
practice in their first season together.

“My freshmen year was tough on 
both of us, but one day in practice 
coach Carr was directing us in a series 
of passing and shooting drills. In this 
drill there were two cutters and two 
passers, so it is up to the passers [Allard 
and former Triton Mike Bakal] to pass 
to the correct person. I believe Mike 
passed the ball to the wrong person 
— so two balls headed full steam at [for-
mer Triton] Parker Berling. After being 
hit with both balls Parker preceded to 
kick the ball as hard as he could out of 
anger — the ball looped off his foot and 
clocked Clint’s head, lifting him off his 
feet and onto the ground,” Hatch said. 
“After a moment of silence [assistant] 
coach [Eric] Olen began to laugh and 
everyone else followed. Clint jumped 
up and laughed it off, a little upset, 
but that is the type of guy Clint is: he 
knows when to joke around and knows 
when to be serious and I respect him 
for that.”

Allard also remembers that first year 

under Carr, calling the first condition-
ing period his “most physically excru-
ciating” moment, but also necessary to 
prepare the team for the battles ahead. 
As a starter for all but 10 games in his 
Triton career, it has been Allard who has 
often led the Tritons into those battles. 
Despite being incredibly effective and 
consistent during all four of his seasons, 
including a career-best 11.7 points per 
game average last year, it would not be 
until his final season that Allard received 
All-CCAA recognition, finishing the 
year averaging 9.8 points, a career-best 
3.9 rebounds, and a team- and career-
best 4.6 assists per 
game that also 
ranks third in the 
CCAA.

“It was nice 
that the other 
coaches in the 
league felt I was 
deserving of All-
CCAA recogni-
tion,” Allard said. 
“Especially as a 
senior, it meant a 
lot. This league is 
full of absolutely 
great players and 
every year people 
get left off meant 
that the other 
coaches in this 
league felt like I brought something 
to this team, and that’s what I wanted 
to do.”

Also an All-CCAA Tournament 
selection following UCSD’s stirring 
CCAA Championship run, Allard has 
been a part of, and catalyst for, many 
of UCSD’s biggest moments during his 
career. Included in the list of firsts is 
not only memorable victories against 
Cal State Bakersfield and Sonoma State, 
but also the Tritons’ first-ever Division-
II postseason victory, first-ever CCAA 
title, first-ever NCAA Division-II 
Tournament berth, and first-ever win 
over a Division-I program. The victory 

against UC Riverside was the culmina-
tion of a long-term goal and, as the first 
game of the 2007-08 season, a strong 
predictor of the successful season to 
follow.

“Our game at UC Riverside was very 
telling for me, because he made a couple 
of big shots that game, played with great 
heart and desire,” Carlson said. “Talking 
to him prior to that game, I know 
how much it meant to him to beat a 
Division-I team. To do that in our first 
game this year, I think was kind of big.”

As an all-around player who has had 
many incredible games and moments, 

it is his leadership 
skills for which 
Allard hopes to best 
be remembered 
for, and it is that 
guidance that both 
coaches and team-
mates are quick to 
point out.

“Clint has basi-
cally been a mentor 
for me throughout 
my UCSD basket-
ball career, encour-
aging me and 
making me a bet-
ter player,” junior 
guard Alan Husted 
said. “Playing the 
same position as 

him, I learned and improved a lot just 
by going at each other every day in 
practice. Personally, I tried to soak up as 
many of his idiosyncrasies on the court 
that I could, as they were obviously 
effective throughout his career.”

Whether he knows it or not, Allard 
is known among his teammates as a 
leader and a teacher.

“Clint is a great leader and an outgo-
ing guy who knows when to be light-
hearted, but also has the ability to be 
very serious at the times that he needs 
to be,” Hatch said. “On the court he 
understands his role, he knows that he 
is the leader and ultimately it is up to 

him to settle the team down and direct 
everybody on the court.”

While hoping to continue to work in 
basketball and pass on some of his own 
knowledge, Allard’s reflections on his 
own career and time at UCSD are more 
attuned to people rather than games. 
While obviously thankful for his time 
in RIMAC Arena and on the various 
other courts he has played, Allard is 
more grateful for the people who have 
surrounded him throughout his career, 
including his mother, Dawn, who has 
traveled to watch him play everywhere 
from Bakersfield to Alaska, his brother 
Clark, who has often traveled from Cal 
Poly and was present during the Senior 
Night ceremony, and Olen, the only 
coach to actually see each of Clint’s col-
legiate games.

“I’ll miss the players and their fami-
lies and all the people I’ve met,” Allard 
said. “I’ll miss the people I won’t see 
every day anymore. As far as athletics, 
I’ll just miss just knowing that there’s six 
months of the year where you’re going 
to spend a couple hours pretty much 
everyday with these guys, and you look 
forward to it. We never had the most 
talent or the most athletic guys or the 
tallest guys, but just knowing that hard 
work, camaraderie, and playing together 
— all that stuff matters. Teamwork is 
very underrated, but it brought us a long 
way. We were overmatched some nights, 
but we always played hard and we always 
gave ourselves a chance to win.”

In his five years at UCSD, Allard has 
been the soul of the program, finishing 
his career as the school’s Divison-II 
leader in points, rebounds, assists, steals, 
starts, free throws made and attempted 
and games and minutes played. Along 
with fellow departing seniors Hatch and 
three-time All-CCAA honoree Henry 
Patterson, Allard has laid an incredible 
foundation that future Triton teams will 
now look to build upon.

HOT CORNER

BASEBALL — A bottom of the ninth, 
bases-loaded walk to junior All-
American first-baseman Matt Cantele 
gave the No. 8 Tritons a 5-4 walk-off 
win in the series finale against No. 2 
Sonoma State on April 20 that salvaged 
a series split and move UCSD to within 
two games of the Seawolves for first 
place in California Collegiate Athletic 
Association standings.

Cantele was already 2-for-4 with a 
homerun in the first inning to open the 
scoring and stake the Tritons to a 1-0 
lead, so it was fitting that he end the 
game with an RBI walk. 

“That was a good at-bat for 
him,” head coach Dan O’Brien said. 
“Obviously the pitcher was struggling 
and Matt recognized that and did a 
real good job of laying off some tough 
pitches.”

UCSD needed walk-off heroics 
to salvage the split, after winning the 
opener 7-4 on April 18 but dropping 
both games of a doubleheader the next 
day by a combined score of 22-8.

The win was just what the Tritons 
wanted to open the series, as the bats 
came alive in the seventh inning to 
score three runs and break a 4-4 tie. 
The Seawolves scored a run in both 
the first and second innings to take 
a 2-0 lead, but the Tritons came back 
with three runs in the bottom of the 
second to take their first lead. The 3-2 
advantage would last until the sixth 
inning, when Sonoma State scored two 
runs, one on catcher Konrad Thieme’s 
second solo shot of the game.

UCSD responded in the bottom 
of the frame with a run after a leadoff 
triple by junior rightfielder Tim Mort. 
After a pitching change, junior cen-
terfielder Nick Burke’s groundout to 
shortstop was enough for Mort to come 
in and tie the game at four. 

Freshman Tim Shibuya entered 
to relieve sophomore starting pitcher 
Kirby St. John and promptly retired 
the Seawolves 1-2-3, two on strikeouts. 
Shibuya picked up the win to improve 
to 7-0 when the Tritons scored three 

runs in the bottom of the seventh and 
cruised to the victory. Shibuya also 
worked a scoreless eighth with another 
two strikeouts and then gave way to 
senior closer Keith Noe, who picked up 
his school-record 12th save. 

“We were outstanding as a ballclub 
on Friday,” O’Brien said. “I thought 
that if we maintained that kind of focus 
and played with that kind of consistent 
baseball all weekend that we could 
make it a very special weekend.”

After the crucial win, the Tritons 

were just one game back of the 
Seawolves heading into the double-
header. Unfortunately, after losing both 
games on April 19, UCSD dropped 
back two games in the standings with 
only two more series remaining before 
the start of the CCAA Tournament. 

In the noon game, the Triton pitch-
ing was disastrous, as all five arms 
that trotted out to the mound could 
not escape without allowing a run,

For five years as a Triton, senior guard Clint Allard has truly defined everything that the up-
and-coming UCSD men’s basketball 
program is about. After redshirting his 
first year on campus, Allard would have 
the opportunity to improve himself 
both physically, as he conditioned and 
learned to eat right, as well as mentally 
while watching from then-head coach 
Greg Lanthier’s bench. 

“Sitting back and watching the 
other teams, I got to see without being 
in there what the competition was like,” 
said Allard of his first year at UCSD.

The only Triton to have witnessed 
the transition from former coach 
Lanthier to Bill Carr in 2004 to the 
current coach Chris Carlson follow-
ing last season, Allard has not only 
endured, but thrived, with the changes. 
For Allard, each coach was able to teach 
him something different and help him 
improve his game.

“Coach Lanthier had a really offen-
sive-oriented game style. The good part 
for me was I got to put up a lot of shots 
everyday [in practice]. I became a much 
better shooter than I was the first year I 
got here. When coach Carr came in, he 
brought a seriousness to this program. 

You’re not going to win unless you play 
defense, and he believed we could play 
defense. He preached defense and he 
preached toughness. That mindset got 
us to where we could compete with the 
top teams in the league and every night 
we had a shot to win. coach Carlson 
came in and with the experience we 
had with hard-nosed defense, he came 
in and gave the players an edge, gave 
us confidence. He still taught us some 
things, but he opened it up and let the 
players play, and I think that was a big 
reason for our success this year.” 

Carlson felt that Clint’s decision to 
return for one final season, despite hav-
ing walked last June and being eligible 
to graduate, was emblematic of the 
player and person Allard has proved to 
be in his time to San Diego.

“It meant a lot to me, personally, 
that he would want to come back this 
year,” Carlson said. “I was the third 
head coach he’s played for in his time 
here, which I don’t think is easy to do. 
It showed me a lot about his character 
and what he meant to his teammates.”

as many Golden State Warriors and 
Stanford Cardinal games as possible

GOLF — The Tritons put togeth-
er a sixth-place finish at the two-
day California Collegiate Athletic 
Association championships in Paso 
Robles on April 21 and 22 with their 
three-round score of 891, 33 shots 
behind the champions, Sonoma State 
University. UCSD couldn’t recover after 
a first-round 300 landed the team in 
sixth place, but improved scores of 293 
and 298 in the latter rounds helped 
end the season on a high note. With 
no seniors on the roster, UCSD has 
had plenty of time to grow as a team, a 
trait that makes it dangerous going into 
next season.

“Our team definitely experienced 
some growing pains this season,” 29th-
year coach Mike Wydra said. “But in 
the long run it will only make our 
team better. I’ve seen how hard this 
team has worked, and it will pay off. 
This program hasn’t been to the NCAA 
Championships since 2004, but I know 
this team is getting closer and closer to 
making a return trip there real soon.” 

Wydra has become a legend during 
his tenure with the Tritons. He’s still 
searching for that elusive champion-
ship after finishing runner-up in the 
national championship five times dur-
ing his career.

Individually, the tournament 
was won by Eric Justesen of Cal State 
Stanislaus, who ran away from the com-
petition with a 14-under par 202 to 
earn individual medalist honors. A first 
round score of 70 put Justesen in a three-
way tie for first, but after that, he left no 
doubt, notching rounds of 65 and 67 to 
distance himself from the second-place 
finisher, the Seawolves’ Jarin Todd, who 
was eight shots behind. Sonoma State 
was the only school to have three golf-
ers finish in the top 10, with Todd, Kyle 
Hopkins in seventh and Chris Galvin, 
tied at ninth, leading the way.

UCSD’s top finisher was junior 
Nathan Phan, who finished a solid sea-
son with a tie for ninth place. His over-

all score of 218 was two shots better 
than junior Ryan Bailey, who finished 
in 14th place. Phan’s first round of 70 
put him in good shape to contend for 
the title, but a second round of 74 ended 
those dreams as he entered the final 
round nine shots behind the lead. A 
final round of 74 ended Phan’s tourna-
ment with a cumulative two over par. 

“Anytime you don’t win, it’s disap-
pointing, and that‘s the way I look at 
these tournaments,” Phan said. “My 
goal is to be the best golfer at the end of 
the day, and I showed I could contend 
after my first round. I just wish I could 
have been more consistent and put my 
team in a better position in rounds two 
and three. I hope that I can put a bet-
ter performance together in the Super 
Regional, where our season is really on 
the line.”

Freshman Keith Okasaki finished 
his first year as a Triton by finishing 
in 15th place, just behind Bailey with 
a score of 221. A great second round 
of 70 was sandwiched between rounds 
of 76 and 75 to put him at five over par. 
Sophomore Austin Alfonso and junior 
Billy Olsen finished near the bottom of 
the individual leaderboard after strug-
gling early. Alfonso shot a first round 
84, which put him in a tie for last, but 
he recovered slightly and finished in a 
tie for 30th out of 35 golfers. Olsen shot 
a first round 82, then followed up with 
rounds of 76 and 77 to finish in 34th 
place with a cumulative score of 235.

The Tritons’ season will be on the 
line in the Division-II Super Regional 
Championship, which starts on May 
5. The three-day tournament’s location 
is yet to be announced. Last year, the 
Tritons finished in sixth place at the 
eight-team event in Colorado. In order 
to make the NCAA Championships, 
UCSD will need to do better than that 
this year. Phan narrowly missed out on 
qualifying for the championships as an 
individual last year, and could contend 
for a spot this year.
