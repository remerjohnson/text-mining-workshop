the General Education 
requirements that may be in

The budget cuts sweeping UCSD are al-

books, but now it looks like they might impact 
student health and fitness as well. As a result of 
cutbacks, the university could dissolve the 
Physical Education Department at the end of 
this year. 

According to Dean of Arts and Humanities

QUORUM: Delegates complain 
that bylaws prevented members 
from passing a new document 
By Alexander ThIesen 
Staff Writer 

After several chaotic meetings, the Asso-
ciated Students' Constitutional Convention 
was dissolved last night when attendance 
dropped below the necessary quorum. 

The third and final meeting was unable to 
begin officially when, because of the resigna-
tion of several frustrated delegates, a quorum 
of members was not present. 

Earlier, several members resigned from 
their positions, citing the sluggish, disorderly 
and argumentative nature of the convention. 
Twice, proceedings were called into early 
recess in order to bypass parliamentary proce-
dure, allowing an open forum to layout goals 
for a new constitution. 

In addition, several members of tbe con-
vention never attended any of the meetings, 
which led to their remova' from the conven-
tion as mandated by the convention bylaws. 

"Most of the members were disheartened 
by the way the convention was playing out .. . 
[with] blatant disrespect for just basic rights 
of courtesy,"· said A.S. Vice President Ad-
ministrative and Convention Chair John 
Barnes. 

Interfraternity Council (IFC) Represen-
tative to the A.S. Council Kirt Wilson re-
signed as a me"mber of the constitutional 
convention after the second meeting, saying 
that he could better use his time with other 
organizations. Wilson said he was frustrated 
by the lack of cooperation between conven-
tion members. 

"I understand people have objections to 
the current structure and so forth, but I think 
when people are just angry and accusational 
to the other members, then you've left the 
hope of getting anything constructive ldoneJ 
completely out of the picture," Wilson said. 

REMAINS OF THE· DAY 
A.S . Director of Development Wally 

Lockwood, co-author of the only proposed 
constitution, blamed the convention failure 
on the delegates' inability to fulfill the goals 
of the convention. "In my mind it was lack of

Student Investigates Use of Social Security Numbers 
ByD .. Kr8ua 
Sen/or Staff Writer 

Most UC students never think 
twice about givina out their social 
security numbers on forms, exams 
and checks. But students may not 
be so willing to use their social 
security numbers for identifica-
tion after hearin, what Kirt Wil-
son has to say. 

For the past year and a half, the 
Muir Colle.e senior has been in-
vadpdn. the inherent security 
dan .... of publicly usin, one's 
IOCiaIllClll'lty number. AlOlll with 
feUow CommunJcadona IlUdents, 
Willon .... wriaen a 3,..,. in-

vestigative report on the subject 
that includes discussion on the fol-
lowing points. 

"Most experts say your social 
security number should be treated 
like your ATM pin number," Wil-
son said. 

The problem, he continued, is 
that there are many cross-refer-
ence darabases thal can be accessed 
by a social security number. 

For instance, according to Wil-
son, whenever one makes a health 
claim with an insurance company, 
theclaima are pooled toaether into 
one tue Ihat can be easily ICCelsed 
witb alOCill IICurity number. In 

this manner, one's health infor-
mation can become public infor-
mation without an individual's 
knowledge. 

This could be a crisis situation 
for someone who has a medical 
condition that might prevent that 
person from beina hired. 

In one extreme example, a 
p'rison inmate read social security 
numbers off of other inmates' uni-
forms and used the numbers to 
apply for various credit cards, 
WiIJon laid. 

Social security numbers can 
also be used to put a second mort-
lIP on a home - even If Ibe 

home doesn't belong to the person 
whose number is used. 

Wilson said many commercial 
corporations like to use social se-
curity numbers because it allows 
them to easily cross-reference in-
formation on customers. 

"It's I good business practice," 
said Wilson. "But it's not a good 
personal practice." 

Mlny organizations ask for 
social secqrity numbers, but often 
they have no legal basis to do so.

A. S~: Council 
pulls the plug on 
chaotic convention 
ContInued from PICe 1 
experience, on the behalf of ev-
erybody, the A.S., the members of 
the coDvention and, obviously, 
most everybody," Lockwood said. 

Even thou,b he had co-
authored the proposed constitu-
tion, Lockwood was also consid-
eriDg resignation prior to the dis-
solution of the convention because 
of his frusttation with the pr0-
ceedings. 

Most delegates agreed that the 
constrictive nature of the conven-

~ion bylaws was a major obstacle 
to holding a convention. Some 
delegates criticized the use of par-
liamentary procedure as unfair to 
members of the public unfamiliar 
with legal jar,on. But the belief 
that the clUTent bylaws would need 
to be severely amended before an-
other convention was called again 
was a widely held opinion among 
delegates. 

"We really have to get the by-
laws sealed before the convention 
starts," said A.S. Commissioner 
of Academic Affairs and constitu-
tion co-author David Valentine. 

"I don't think we should spend 
time in here to set up the system 
in which it works," Valentine 
added. 

"I don't want to have to call 
another convention, and in the 
middle of the convention find out 
or find some little tiny delineation

in the bylaws that says you have to 
do such and such here or there. 
We either have to change it or 
dissolve the constitutional conven-
tion again," Barnes said. 

"There's a real problem when 
you have a convention that's so 
dominated by the structure that it 
is supposed to restructure," said 
A.S. Vice President External Nick 
Endres. He added that if the cur-
tent A.S. structure is flawed, then 
the bylaws regulating the making 
of a new structure are also flawed. 

Many also felt that there was a 
general lack of publicity and ex-

The UCSD Guardian 

planation of informalion available 
about the convention prior to its 
opening, preventing members of 
the public from becoming more 
involved. 

"In tenns of general informal 
information sessions with indi-
vidual representatives, 1 think we 
did our job. BUI as for publicity, 
maybe we were a little bit lacking. 
We recognize that and we're go-
ing to fix it," Barnes said. 

Despite the delegates' disap-
pointmenl, many saw the conven-
tion as a lesson learned. They were 
hopeful that another convention 
with both bylaw revisions and in-
creased publicity would be called 
within the next year. Possible by-
law revisions include an extended 
time frame for holding the con-
vention and a more open member-
ship structure. The possibility of 
holding the convention for aca-
demic course credits was also pro-
posed. ~ 

Endres suggested the idea of 
using the convention to create and 
ratify a document, rather than to 
approve already pre-submitted 
ones. 

"We need to have some free-
dom in the convention for discus-
sion, forcreation, for dialogue, for 
the venting of ideas. And we also 
need to have some room for a 
structured review process. That's 
the challenge we have before us," 
Endres said. 

Both Lockwood and Valentine 
said they would resubmit their 
document with significant alter-
ations if a new convention is called.

UC Plans Would Save 
Neither Money nor Quality 

When the University of California Board of Regenas told us it was 
raising fees again, at least it seemed to have good intentions -
preserving UC quality during the budget crisis. However distasteful 
the idea of shelling out more cash for this faltering institutiOn, at least 
we could expect a somewhat decent educadon. Hinting at a brighter 
future, UC President Jack Peltason said, "Maintaining the quality of 
the University of.CaIifomia is what this budget is all abouL" 

But a recent program to change academic policies, WIder review by 
the Office of the President, prove that the new fees have nothing to do 
with preserving the quality of education. In fact, thechanges. intended 
to streamline the education process, hack quality off at the knees. 
Maybe Peltason meant to preserve the quality of administrative 
pemiolL'l or the blessings of an expanded bureaucracy, but education 
certainly had little to do with it 

The proposed changes contain several serious flaws. One change 
- switching all nine campuses to the semester system - would cause 
fiscal and educational chaos. The Academic Senate at UC Davis 
recently considered reverting to the semester system. Its comeIL'IUS: 
the shift would cost too much money to administer, nullifying any 
projected savin~. Additionally, such a transition would disrupt the 
schedules and pllllL'l of both students and faculty. 

Other optiOIL'l under colL'lideration, although not as obviously 
flawed, would certainly do their share to wreak havoc. The Office of 
the President is looking at a plan to stretch the nine-month COW'SC load 
over the entire year. Students wouldn't be expected to stay on campus 
all year, but many students might get Winter Quarter off instead of 
summer. 

1be plan sounds reasonable, but there's a hidden cost. The course 
offerings would stretch out over the year, so students needing certain 
courses may be forced to stay in school year round. Instead of taking 
48 units for nine months, students will be forced to take 12 units during 
all four quarters. The fiscal impact of this is obvious: unable to obtain 
their normal summer jobs and perhaps even having to pay for an extra 
quarter, students will require more financial aid. 

Further, the year-round plan would become a logistical nightmare. 
Campus employers would no longer be able to rely on students being 
in or out of school at certain times. Organizations such as the 
Associated Students and the GUQrdilln would be forced to deal with a 
constantly shifting workforce and would go through nonstop training. 
Such a shortsighted change would only cause more problems. 

Luckily, these plans have nol yet been officially proposed by the 
Office of the President. And if the intentions of the UC officials 
actually include preserving the quality of education, they never will be. 

Protest Lost to Stupidity 
Last Thursday night's candlelight vigil to protest the latest round of 

fee hikes could have been an empowering moment for UCSD stu-
dents. With a $620 fee increase to be implemented next year and even 
more hikes on the horizon, students throughout the University of 
California need to convince the Board of Regents of the importance of 
keeping a UC education affordable. Unfortunately, the vigil failed 
because organizers and participants reverted to infantile tactics. 

1bere were the usual profanity-laden diatribes aimed at the regents, 
who wouldn't be too eager to listen to a group of students that hung a 
regent in effigy. But the most bizarre display came from rail y organizer 
Jenner McCloskey who said she "wants each UC to take one or two 
regents and do some investigating to find one or two skeletons in each 
of theirclosets and do a little blackmailing or something. "When asked 
later to clarify what exactly she meant, McCloskey explained that 
"these crazy times demand some crazy a1tematiVtS." 

"Crazy" is a mild way to put it Why not just tar and feather the 
regents and drag them through the streets? Why not firebomb their 
homes? Why not just have the non-believers executed at dawn? The 
answer is simple-all of these "suggestions"'are illegal and unethical. 

It was just a month ago that Student Regent Darby Morrisroe visited 
UCSD and told students that the most effective way to lobby the Board 
of Regents was to present a clear, fact-based, persuasive argwnent. 
"There are a munber of repts who want to support us, but they need 
reasons," Morrisroe aid. We can safely asswne that threatening 
blackmail wasn't exactly what she had in mind. 

It's not in the bestintaatofstudenlS when someone like McCloskey, 
who works in the AS. External Office and attended the meeting with 
Morrisroe, seriously suggests that students should resort to blackmail. 
If we are to be taken seriously by the Board of Regents, we need to act 
like adults, not spoiled children.

The break for women in politics was set by a number

rently has. 

1bere are, of coune, women who 
have led their countries as a result of their 
husbands' or fathers' legacy. Eva Peron 
of Argentina is a classic example. How-
ever, this doesn't negate the achieve-
ments of others, such IS Benazir Bhutto

Sunday. A few months ago nobody 
thought that she had the slightest chance 
of winning. Her party, the Swedish 
People's Party, could only muster six 
percent of the popular vote and Finns had 
never elected a woman to fill their highest 
office. With a tenacity and effICiency that 
has impressed the Scandinavian nation, 
Rehn has overcome these obstacles. 

If she wins, Rehn will join Oro 
Brundtland of Norway as the second fe-
male leader in Scandinavia. As Prime 
Minister, BrundIIand has made an even 
deeper impression on Europe and the 
world. She has been instrumental in plac-
ing environmental issues on the agenda 
and, as author of the "8rundtland PIan," 
she illustrated how sustainable economic 
growth can be implemented in the devel-
oped world.

While it's true that women are mak-

there is stiD a buge disparity between 
Western nations. In FinJand,forexample, 
one-third of the cabinet and one-third of 
the parliamentary members are women 
(the figures are comparable throughout 
Scandinavia), while in Britain only five 
pen:cnt of the parliament's members are 
women. In the United States, and only as 
a result ofan increase in thel992 elec-
tion, four out 100 senators are cUrrently 
women.

COMMENTARY: Alternative theories of AIDS which blame behavior instead oflflV promote baseless stereotypes and intolerance 

CRANK THEORIES WON'T PREVENT AIDS 
By ErIc Schmidt 
Senior Staff Writer 

People with AIDS have sinned themselves 
into their own fatal holes. If they hadn't lived the 
Iifestylesofheavily sedated 1970s rockers, those 
with AIDS wouldn't inhabit coffins today. 

At least, that's what pro~nents of alterna-
tive theories of AIDS and moralists would like 
the public to believe. Take the case of Peter 
Duesberg, a University of California Berkeley 
scientist who thinks the HIV virus doesn't cause 
AIDS. Duesberg wants grant money to study the 
theory that personal behavior, in tandem with 
certain other viruses, causes AIDS - and he's 
really mad that no one will give him the cash. 

Duesberg bases his theory on presumed risk 
factors associated with certain groups, not from 
tainted blood or sexual contact. Homosexuals, 
for instance, get AIDS from their crazy use of 
drugs, poor nutrition and constant bouts of vene-
real disease. Hemophiliacs contract AJDS be-
cause their illness makes them vulnerable. These 
high-risk activities induce a collapse of the 
immune system, which is usually-and incor-
rcctJy - attributed 10 HIV infection, according 
to Duesberg. Further, many cases of AJDS are 
incorrectly diagnosed, so the number of cases is 
overreported. 

But the fad is, most gays who got AIDS 
didn't fry their brains with cxlllstant drug use. 
Most did not live on the immoral underbelly of 
society. In reality, most heterosexuals would 
havediffiallty disceming any stereotypical 'py' 
lifestyle. Most heterosexuals wouldn't eYeII be 
able to discern a gay man in a crowd. So the idea 

that these immoral people are 
out there just waiting for death 
to strike them into the pit of 
hell doesn't really make sense 
- unless you takean ignorant, 
stereotyped view of the homo-
sexual community. Sure, some 
gays do drugs. Others don't. 
It's the same in every group. 

Duesberg'shidden assump-
tions, instead of reflecting his 
scientifIC objectivity, reveal his 
underlying prejudice, one 
which he shares with a large 
number of Americans. He 
seems to believe homosexuals 
to be deviants who don't fol-
low standard morals in any 
sense. 'Those assumptions are 
unproven and false.

for Instance, .et 
AIDS from

constant bouts of

don't have AIDS. 

Millions of people in this 
country have poor nutritional 
habits, but they don 'I have 
AIDS. They may have an early 
heart attack from theconsump-
lion of excess luncheon ham 
or get lung cancer from ciga-
rette smoking, but they still 
don't get AIDS. I fDuesberg's 
so-called alternative theory 
were actually applicable, why 
wouldn't moreofthesegrossly 
unhealthy types gel AIDS? 
Why wouldn't a proportional 
numberof women get AIDS? 
Cancervictirns are not blamed, 
even though they may have 
terrible health habits, but it 

Duesbergdoes have a point, 
though. The use of drugs, mal-

V ...... d •• _. seems OK to point the finger 
nutrition, even loss of sleep, all contribute to the 
demise of the immune system. Any doctor worth 
his degree will tell you so. OJronic high-risk 
actions will cause sickness, but they can in no 
way be blamed for every case of AIDS. 

. What Duesberg forgets is that almost every 
disease can be attributed to 'high-risk' actions, at 
least to some degree. Cancer, cirrhosis, heart 
attacks, strokes and diabetes are all caused or 
substantially influenced by the actions cited by 
Duesberg. A lot of people drink too much, many 
take a line of coke here or there, some do the 
nitrite 'poppers' Duesberg implicates as a cause 

at gays. 
In addition to these blatant holes in his 

theory,Duesbergciiesanumberofotherstrange 
points. The gay activity of fist-fucking, con-
sisting of shoving a fist up a man's anus, is 
listed as a cause of extreme trauma which 
would promote a disease with A1DS-likesymp-
toms. It's unclear, however, how common the 
practiceofflSting is among gay men. Try iton 
yourselfbeforecomingtoa painful conclusion. 

According to Duesberg, the evidence of 
HlV in Africa is scant. While many claim this 
has been caused by underreporting of cases, 
Duesberg maintains that HIV -induced AIDS is 

very low in Africa. However, most researchers 
acknowledge a huge incidence of both AIDS 
and HIV virus in Mrica. 

A number of other misconceptions plague 
Duesberg in his efforts to produce an alternative 
theory. The idea of a non-HIV route to AIDS 
deserves some looking into, but such efforts 
should not be taken too seriously until solid 
proof of an alternative theory is obtained. Un-
likely as they are, such theories are more likely 
to spread panic and prejudice rather than actu-
ally helping the sick. 

Duesberg's theory-and subsequent moral-
ist backlash- is particularly dangerous as HIV 
reaches epidemic proportions. According to the 
Nov. 19, 1993, issue of the Center for Disease 
o,ntrol's MorlJidUy and Mortality Weekl), Re-
port (MMWR), HIV recently became the lead-
ing cause of death among American males be-
tween the ages of 25 and 44. And HIV among 
women, while still proportionally low, is rising 
and now takes out about eighl in 100,000 fe-
males. 

The first MMWR of this year listed the 'total 
number of AIDS cases at 93,282 in 1993. Hope-
fully, common misconceptions spawned by 'al-
ternative' theories will not contribute toa higher 
figure . 

Yes, unhealthy behaviors lead to disease. 
People who doubt that the HIV virus causes 
AIDS can keep themselves at low risk by main-
taining a healthy lifestyle. And if, as Duesberg 
suggests, sexual contact is not • cause of AIDS, 
wearing a condom will at least keep the clap 
away.

Frankly, I am tired of the whining 

and ongoing complaining by students 
who fail to recognize that there is no 
such thing as "free lunch" and that 
people who work for a living are 
entitled to consideration for fee in-
creases in wages as either a merit 
increase and/or to keep pace with 
inflation. 

With that said, I think it is totaUy 

sor Angela Davis has run four ~mes, 
but IS a communist, she was hardly. 
serious candidate!) 

Geraldine Ferraro perhaps came 
closest in Mondale's doomed 1984 
presidential campaign, and the re-
doubtable Jean Kirkpatrick has often 
been touted as a possible contender. 
However, gazing towanll996, there 

unreasonable on die part ofdle "com-
plainers" 10 expect that there Ibould 
never be increases in student fees. I 
found it interating that, when inter-
viewed by the media after the regents' 
announcement, several students re-
sponded by saying that the fee in-
crease would force them to seek. em-
ployment either after the school day 
or during summer break. Isn't it ter-
rible! They also might have 10 give up 
those extra beers, cokes, CDs, rock 
concerts, new stmo equipment, surf-
boards and wetsuits, expensive 
Reebocks and Nikes, designer jeans 
and so forth. 

Instead of just protesting higher 
fees, why haven't these complainers 
taken an active role in helping the UC 
system by rccommendingsuggestions 
to reduce costs or increase fees in 
specific areas to maintain reasonable 
overall fees and provide the necessary 
increase in wages in university em-
ployees? 

Here are some of my recommen-
dations: 

1. Require documentation from all 
students each semester that they are 
permanent california residents and 
citizens of the United States for a 
minimum of two years to receive t~ 

seems to be no woman with a suffi-
cient base of power to mount a serious 
chIllenge. 

Until the day arrives, perhaps we 
should consoleourselves with the fact 
that someofthemo5t influential people 
in the White House have been 
unelected "first ladies." They have 
often used their talents behind the 

lowest feec:barge.lfthey cannoc meet 
these conditions, they should be 
charged signiflCalldy higher fces; 

2 Raise sophomore, junior and 
senior minimum grade requirements 
eo "wipe out" thole individuals who 
are just spending time in school rather 
than being serious about education. 
Pahapsthefundssavedoouklbecban-
neIed to appmItice training programs 
for plumbers, carpenters, etc; 

3. Identify university jobs that 
could be performed by a cadre of 
students who could earn fee c:rcdits 
for work performed; 

4. Develop an ongoing and rotat-
ing student task force that can recom-
mend money-saving ideas to the UC 
Regents; 

I'm sure that, given the cballenge, 
the "complainers" and others in the 
student body can expand upon my list; 

Finally, neither "big" nor "more, " 
by way of employees or students, 
makes tbe university better. Both 
groups should be in correct propor-
tion to each other. Good employees 
need good, competitive and fair com-
pensation to provide a good educa-
tion. Serious students need to pay 
their share to obtain a good education.

P.E.: Six 
temporary staff to be 
laid off next year 
Continued from pac. 1 
the proposal, it was sent to the 
Academic Senate for debate. where 
it is still under review. 

Last year, the university sus-
pended the P.E. minor. 

Chodorow predicts that the sen-
ate will hand down a response to 
this latest proposal by the end of 
February and that a final decision 
will be made by the end of Winter 
Quarter. However, he said he is 
not optimistic about the finure of 
the P.E. Department. 

"We have to pull the resources 
we have into academic depart-
ments," Chodorow said. 

Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Joseph Watson said that 
Student Affairs may provide P.E. 
classes if the courses could still be 
offered for credit If a course is 
offered for credit, it is eligible (or 
university funding. 

As of last week. Cbodorow said 
that such an action was unlikely. 

P .E. classes may still be of-
fered under the auspices of the 
campus recreation department. 
"Student Affairs wants to respond 
to the interests and needs of stu-
dents, and we will do it through 

~ recreation program," Watson 
said. 

However, if the classes are run 
by the recreation departments, stu-
dents could be requiml to pay a 
fee to enroll. "If there is interest in 
classes, students will get them. 
They might have to pay for them, 
but they will get them," Chodorow 
said. 

The termination of the Physi-
cal Education Department will 
mean the elimination of some fac-
ulty. The contracts of six Teachers 
of Special Programs (TSPs), who 
are considered to be temporary 
staff. have not been renewed. All 
that will remain of the P.E. De-

two permanent staff members -
Chuck Millenbah, who is the de-
partment chairman, and Physical 
Education Supervisor Barry 
Cunningham. According to 
Chodorow, the contracts for two 
of the temporary staff members. 
which were to expire this year, 
will still be honored by the univer-
sity. 

Millenbah emphasized that the 
staff has known about the cut-
backs since last year, but the TSPs 
have been in a state o( uncenainty, 
waiting .to hear if credit will be 
offered for the courses. 

If credit is granted, university 
fubding could be provided and 
the TSPs could continue teach-
ing in some capacity, a possibil-
ity that now seems unlikely. 

Millenbah added that some of 
the TSPs are only teaching three 
classes. But others, like Linda 
Sundstrom, are teaching eight 
classes. "We feel it's ridiculous. 
Our department had 30-0dd fac-
ulty members a few years ago," 
Sundstrom said. 

Sundstrom said she is worried 
about the lack of outlets for stress 
reduction that might result from 
the dissolution of the department. 

the Salvation Army and South Bay 
Community Services. 

The Volunteer Connection acts 
as a liaison between UCSD and 
the San Diego community. 

Director of Special Projects 
Aaron Schweizer said he finds the 
experience of volunteering per-
sonally rewarding. 

"You never know who these 
people are until you go down and 
talk to them. They're not very dif-
ferent from people who don ' t need 
support," Schweizer said. 

"Students can't afford the fee 
hikes, much less afford to pay for 
exercise classes," she added. 

Mike VanderGriend. another 
TSP. agreed with Sundstrom. He 
said that most of the students with 
whom he has spoken want the 0.5 
credit. 

"Originally, when the depan-
ment was set up, [ was told that 
P.E. was one of the most impor-
tant areas on campus~ I was told 
that P.E. was one of the ways of 
keeping students at UCSD," 
VanderGriend added. 

Sundstrom said that if the stu-
dents had been made more aware 
of the demise of the department, 
they might have been able to do 
something about it. 

Chodorow, Watson and 
Millenbah agreed that the people 
who are being injured most by the 
cutbacks and the elimination of 
the P.E. Department are the stu-
dents. 

. "I think the one thing the cut-
backs are doing is short-changing 
the students. I would personally 
like to see physical education in 
some form on campus. But I am 
being positive and maybe, with 
some ingenuity and hope. we can 
work it out," Millenbah said. 

So far, this particular project 
has been successful with about 
eight groups which pledged their 
time over the three days. 

All of the projects are available 
throughout the year. Schweizer 
organized the project in order to 
"get people involvedandgive them 
a chance to get a taste of volun-
teering so they ' ll go back." 

Those interested in helping out 
can go to the Volunteer Connec-
tion on the second floor of the

ID: Students can 
get a new number 
for a small fee 
ContInued from peae 1 
questing a social security number. 
The first is the law or presidential 
order that gives an organization 
the authority to require a social 
security number. The second is 
how the number will be used. The 
third is whether the divulgence of 
the number is voluntary or manda-
tory. Fourth is the penalty for not 
providing the social security num-
ber if it is mandatory. 

One of the most blatant viola-
tions of this act, according to 
Wilson's research, is the applica-
tion for a federal passport. 

Although UCSD asks students 
to use their social security num-
bers as their student identification 
numbers, the university cannot le-
gally require students to divulge 
their social security numbers. The 
only exception, said Wilson, is the 
financial aid office. 

WiI~n went to the Registrar's 
Office to have his social security 
number purged from the univer-
sity systems and replaced with a 
computer-generated number. 

For a small fee, he was given a 
new number, but soon he found 
that his social security number 
could still bring up his file. 

Wilson said that most of the 
offices on campus are able to deal 
with his new number, but occa-
sionally he' ll run into a snag. For 
instance, his new number didn't 
work on the T -reg system. 

According to Assistant Regis-
trar Bill Brown, "a system-gener-
ated [student identification] num-
ber is available on request." 

Brown said that in the three 
years since social security num-
bers were adopted as student iden-
tification numbers, less than a 
dozen students have requested to 
have a computer-generated num-
ber. This option hasn' t been pr0-
moted, because it hasn't been a big 
concern for most students, Brown 
said. 

Brown said that ·there is not a 
security problem in terms of using 
social security numbers for cam-
pus functions because a second 
form of identification is usually 
required. On T-reg, for example, 
one needs a personal access code 
to use the system. To get a tran-
script, one must present a photo 
identification. 

Wilson' said tha( once the uni-
versity has a student's social secu-
rity number, it is "very, very care-
ful to respect [students') privacy. 

"I think that every person 
should have control of their own 
personal information," Wilson 
added.

The Wonder Stuff ataya true to Ita aound on Ita Iat ... album. 

British band, which plays 'at the Belly Up Tavern 
on Monday, constructs a new sound 

By DAN MCDOWELL 
SENIOR STAFF WRITER 

ith its fourth ~lease, Construction of the Modem Idiot, ~he Wonder Stuff 
is still producing viable and unique guitar pop. The British band has 
managed to combine the energy and playfulness of its debut album, Eight 
Legged Groove Machine, with the mature, though still sarcastic, songwriting 
reflected in its third release, Never Loved Elvis. The Wonder Stuff has 

. gracefully and successfully found the balance between the two and has 
kept true to its musical and personal ideologies. The band will be playing with Chapterhouse at the 
Belly Up Tavern in Solana Beach on Monday, Feb. 7. In a recent phone interview from his hoine in 
England, guitarist and vocalist Malcom Treece explained. how and why the band has reached the point 
it is at today.

It's nice to meet other people in

- a really strong bill so it was nice 
to be on the bill.

Yes. It is kind of what we think 
about commercialism. We don't 
want to compromise ideas at all. 
But being on a major label as well, 

the point is to get yourmusicacross 
to as many people as possible, and 
with ourselves to not compromise 
our ideas at all. So you can take as 
you will with that song.

Well, we always do what we 
want to do really, and the record

as well . There's no conscious ef-
fort to say let's do this and see how 
much wecan get away with. We've 
never really thought about it in that 
sense. We just do what we do.

If you could see me now you 
wouldn't ask that. We don't even

we might think it was a good laugh 
being in a band and all.

It wasn't on purpose, it just kind

the album anyways, so we had a lot 
of songs to knock around. Tunes 
sometimes came with lyrics, and 
there wasn't a conscious effort to 
make the album dark or anything. I 
don't really see like that to be hon-
est. I just think it is exhausting and 
that is reflected in our songs. 
How did you choose the title

It is quite self-explanatory, I 
think. I would kind of like every-
body to take as they want really. 
I'll leave that up to the good read-

THEATRE 

Mr. A's Amazing Maze Plays 
Production trivializes audience interaction 

By John Godfrey 
Staff Writer 

In the "Playwright's Notes" 
accompanying his current Old 
Globe Theatre production, play-
wright Alan Ayckbourn confesses 
that heenjoyswatchingactorsdrop 
their lines, their props and their 
composure. In fact, the author 
states rather bluntly that he chose 
a career in playwriting because 
small, memorable blunders occur 
in the theater with regularity. 

Ayckbourn isquite right in sug-
gesting that theater's immediacy 
is a special attribute, a quality 
which cannot be improved upon 
by camera media. He is also right 
to point out in his essay that many 

those who disturb him. When Mr. 
Accousticus moves in next door to 
Suzy (Jennifer Hugus) and her dog 
Neville (Sean Sullivan), he warns 
Nevilte that his bark is too loud. 
Several scenes later, of course, 
Mr. Accousticus swipes Neville's 
voice, prompting Suzy and her 
dog on a journey to recover this 
lost possession. 

ence members a thrill because they 
have an opportunity to control 
what is happening on stage. Simi-
larly, the actors have to be on their 
toes, fully prepared to "act out" 
the path the audience chooses. In 
trying to orchestrate the chaos, 
however, Ayckbourn has created 
a play full of predictability. 

Tburlday, February 3, 1994 

, . professional productions seem too 
slick and calculated when they 
should strive to appear somehow 
spontaneous. 

As it turns out, the only way to 
recover Neville's bark, not to men-
tion Suzy's mother's (Lynne Grif-
fin) voice, is to break into Mr. 
Accousticus' mansion and findout 
where he stores all the stolen 
voices. As Suzy and Neville ex-
plore the mansion, Ayckbourn tries 
to pump some excitement into the 
proceedings. The cast quite liter-
ally does not know what is going 
to happen next because 
Ayckbourne has writlen several 
forks into the path of his two cen-
tral characters. Two narrators 
(Katherine McGrath and Ralph 
Elias) stop the action on stage and 
ask the audience which way they 
would like Neville and Suzy to go. 
Audience members vote by rais-
ing their hands, and Neville and 
Suzy do as they are prodded. 

One of the key problems with 
Ayckbourn's use of this theatrical 
device is that the stakes are so 
incredibly low. The audience 
knows from the outset that Suzy 
and Neville are going to find the 
missing voices - the big finale is 
blatantly set up in the opening 
minutes of the play - so what 
does it malterwhetherwe tell Suzy 
to walk down the hall or jump 
through the window? 

It doesn't malter. Not really . 
And there is no excuse for it. Even 
in a play that is billed for "chil-
dren from five to lOS," the audi-
ence participation should have 
some sort of substance. Kids are 
more sophisticated than this play 
indicates. They've seen comedi-
ans like Robin Williams riff off of 
audience suggestions, so they'll 
be unforgiving i flhe "interaction" 
seems to be merely a contrivance. 

; 

In trying to rectify this dilemma, 
however, Ayckbourn has attacked 
the symptoms rather than the dis-
ease. His "Mr. A's Amazing Maze 
Plays" is every bit as calculated 
and contrived as the performances 
he denounces . 

The fairy tale-like story sur-
rou nds Mr. Accoust icus (Jonathan 
McMurtry), an elegant and myste-
rious man who steals the voices of 

In theory, this sort of theatrical 
device is supposed to give audi-

Fellinis larulmarkfilm will

The art of filmmaking has 
come a long way. From silent 
moving pictures to computer ani-
mation, the world of film has un-
dergone many metamorphoses, for 
which numerous directors are re-
sponsible. 

The re-release 'of La Strada 
shows that Fellini's work is still 
significant, even though he passed 
away last )ear. 

Director Martin Scorsese, who 
has cited the influence of Fellini 
on his own work, is behind its re-

Undoubtedly, one of the great 
masters of cinema is Italian direc-
tor Federico Fellini, who directed 
classic films such as 8 1/2 (1963), 
La Dolce Vita (1960), and his con-
troversial film La Strada (1954). 
Starting Friday, La Strada , which 
won an Academy Award for best

HIATUS 6 

MAZE: Veteran 
actors can't save play 
Contl ••• d 110m ..... H4 

Sadly, that 's what it is. On open-
ing night, the audience interacted 
with the actors on five or six sepa-
rate occasions, and at each inter-
val, it became more and more evi-
dent that the playwright was sim-
ply tossing the audience a bone to 
make it feel "involved." 

Old Globe Executive Producer 
Craig Noel directed this produc-
tion with too much earnestness 
and not enough self-deprecation. 
The play hits its stride when it 
pokes fun at itself - such as when 
actor Sean Sullivan underlines the 
fact that he is portraying a dog-
but these moments are all too rare. 

The tremendous quality of the 
cast is even more disheartening. 
For some reason, the Globe hired 
four of its big guns to work on this 
production- veterans McMurtry, 
McGrath, Griffin and the mesmer-
izing Richard Easton. To watch all 
of this talent expending its ener-
gies on a play this slight proved 

\ ' sadly appropriate. 
"Mr. A's Amazing Maze Plays" 

runs through March 6. For more 
information, call 239-2255. 

FELLINI: 
Landmark film to 
show at the Ken 
Continued from ..... H5 

"It is good that Fellini's films 
are being released [and that] acon-
text is being created for him: ... 
Fellini is a true master, yet one 
who is not well known here in the 
United States," said UCSD Italian 
Film and Literature Professor 
Pasquale Verdicchio. 

LaS/rada, a film that broke the 
Neorealisttradition, was criticized 
because it was more poetic and 
subjective. 

Despite the attacks, Fellini 
stuck with his work. According to 
Verdicchio, Fellini said "We all 
have different subjective realities; 
rea I i ty is the collection of all those 
subjective realities." 

The poetic nature of La Strada 
is powerful through its very sim-
pi icity. Its story embraces the com-
plex and universal questions about 
the significance of human e~ist­
ence. 

Through his characters, Fellini 
captures the weight of the philo-
sophical issues with which the film 
deals . 

Fellini retracts from using so-
phisticated techniques, but he ex-
ploits the skills of his actors. "\I 
Mallo," or the Fool (Richard 
Basehart), is a tightrope walker 
who seems to be a kind of a fallen 
angel. 

Because of his attitude , 
Zampano has been an influential 
character. Verdicchio said that 
Zampano was the source of inspi-
ration for Kris Kristofferson 's clas-
sic rock song "Me and Bobby 
McGee." 

Fellini 's La Strada withstands 
the test of time, and it deserves a 
revered place in ci nematic history. 

. La Strada opens tomorrow at

ART 

Oliver Jackson 
Abstract painter's works are on exhibit in La Jolla 

By C.re Udell 
Staff Writer 

Blending African art and cul-
ture with a Western tradition of 
modernism, Oliver Jackson cre-
atesanambienceofabstract unity. 
His paintings and sculpture, now 
on display at the Porter Randall 
Gallery in La Jolla, continue to 
demonstrate his flourishing style. 

Jackson, a St. Louis native who 
presently teaches art at Sacra-
mento State University, got his 
start with the Black Artists Group 
(BAG) in the t 960s. 

This organization of collabo-
rating visual artists, poets and mu-
sicians set out to encourage Afri-
can Americans in St. Louis to edu-
cate others about African-Ameri-
can culture. Jackson has drawn-
much of his inspiration from this 
creativeand supportive group, and 
its influence is still evident in his 

work. 
The majority of the paintings 

in his current exhibit incorporate 
Jackson ' s well-known "paint 
people" figures which allude to 
African Nkonde forms. He places 
these simplistic people within 
elaborate landscapes, constructing 
a metaphorical representation of 
humans and society. 

Jackson's practical methods are 
not particularly unique, but his 
choice of imagery offers new ideas 
about an interactive world. 

Most of the compositions de-
pict a setti ng occupied by multiple 
figures, representing a pool of 
people rather than an individual 
living alone within the landscape. 
This sense of communal existence 
provides a more integrated picture 
of people and the environment. 

Jackson has often been com-
pared to other abstract expression-

ists suchas Pollock and de Kooning 
because of his emphatic and cha-
otic mixture or color and imagery. 
His flurried brushstrokes also 
evoke images of van Gogh's and 
Schiele's landscapes, which use 
loud, strong colors. 

The various shades Jackson 
chooses, whether ominously dark 
or softly calm, always envelop his 
figures. 

At first camouflaged by rich, 
swirling strokes, thc silhouettes of 
these faceless people begin to ap-
pear like forms which suddenly 
emerge in clouds or in patterned 
wallpaper. 

Jackson explains the way he 
envisions his art when he says, 
"The responsibility of the artist is 
to give back not a reflection, but a 
sense of clarity about the spiritual 
state." 

In this way he tells a spiritual 

story in which the figures in 
their various meditative posi-
tions symbolize different states 
of consciousness. Their ges-
tures, such as crouching and 
huddling, are more striking than 
the figures themselves. 

While every work in this 
exhibit (and throughout his ca-
reer) remains "Untitled," 
Jackson's message about com-
munal relationships is a strong 
motif throughout. 

In addition to this overall 
theme, the viewer is ultimately 
left to run freely with his or her 
personal imagination and inter-
pretation. 

Oliver Jackson's "Paintinll 
and Sculpture" runs through 
Feb. 28 at the Porter Randall 
Gallery in downtown La Jolla. 
Admission is free. For more 
information, call S51-8884.

SEASON OPENER: Inexperienced UCSD women's tennis destroys NAIA rival Point Lorna College, 7-2 
It was just another day in 

May when Michael Jordan 
eliminated the Cleveland 
Cavaliers from the first round 
of the playoffs in a five-game 
thriller. But it spelled the 
beginning of the end for the 
rest of the NBA. 

From there, Jordan and the 
Chicago Bulls proceeded to 
dissect what remained of the 
Eastern Conference, including 
the Bad Boy Detroit Pistons 
and the mighty New York 
Knicks. 

Jordan went on to win three 
straight NBA championships, 
and all the while he danced and 
cried and hugged his wife and 
blah blah blah. 

So Michael Jordan became 
a stronger fixture in American 
culture than apple pie and 
drive-by shootings. He was 
awesome. He was unstoppable. 
He was Air. 

Then he retired at the very 
pinnacle of his career. A player 
couldn't walk away from a 
sport on a better note - nine 
straight All-Star appearances, 
eight scoring titles, three 
championship banners and 
oodles of endorsements.

The UCSD women's tennis team 
competed in its first match of the 
season on Tuesday, crushing NAtA 

opponent 
Point Loma, 
7-2, in a 
hard-fought 
road victory. 

Entering 
the match, 
UCSD Head 

Point 
Loma com-
petition 
would be 
challenging. 

"Point Lorna is tough enough 
that we knew we would have to play 
well to win," LaPlante said. 'They 
are a scholarship school, so we knew 
we were in for a tough match." 

Three of the top six Triton singles 
players were taking part in theirfirst 
collegiate matches, but fortunately, 
the youngsters responded well on 
this day, as they rose to the occasion 
to post the victory. 

The score, however, was not in· 
dicati ve of the closeness of the con-
test. Overall, it was a grueling after-
noon, with many of the matches 
coming down to the wire. 

Sophomore Hillary Somers, who 
hasn't played tennis competitively 
since herjunioryearofhigh school, 
was one of the many rookies who 
made an impact. Playing in the num· 
ber-two singles spot, Somers won 

Jason Rltchie/Gu.roian 
Sophomore Miki Kurokaw. teamed up with .. nlor Heather 
WIlliams to Oy.rcome Point Loma'. number-one doubles team. 
an epic, two-hour battle. 

The first set alone lasted a brutal 
hour-and-a-half. But after taking the 
tie-breaker,7-6, Somers caught her 
second wind and quickly polished 
off her opponent in the second set, 
6-2. 

"[Somers] played a great match," 

LaPlante said. "She showed a lot of 
mental toughness." 

Another young player who made 
her presence known in her fi rst col-
legiate match was freshm an 
Michelle Maldphersakal, playing in 
the number-four singles spot. In a 
near-flawless performance, she 

breezed by her opponent, 6-0. 6-0. 
UCSD' s strong singles play car-

ried over into the doubles arena. 
where the Tritons also dominated. 

The top-rated doubles team of 
sophomore Miki Kurokawa and se-
nior Heather Williams led the way, 
overcoming a slow start to pull out a 
6-7, 6-4.6-2 victory. 

After losi ng the fi r.;t set, the duo 
began to gel, dispatching its adver-
saries rather quickly in the second 
and third sets. It was their fi rst match 
together. 

The number-two doubles team 
of Somers and Maldphersakal was 
equally impressive, eliminating its 
counterpans, 6-3, 3·6, 6-2. 

The team looks to improve on 
this fine outing when two of its top 
players return from injury. 

Diane Chandler,the number·two 
singles player last season, has been 
out with tendonitis in her wrist. The 
injury forces LaPlante to move the 
other players up a notch in the 
rankings. 

"We're playing around with the 
lineup," laPlante said. 

Another player on the injured 
list, Yumi Takemoto, has been wear-
ing a cast for six weeks. She hopes 
to pick up her racket and join the 
squad in a few weeks. 

LaPlante felt that Tuesday's 
strong performance was the begin-
ning of what looks to be an e ~cep· 
tional season for the Tritons. 

" It was a grueling first match." 
LaPlante said. "[' m look i ng forward 
to a successful season and I'm look-
ing forward to the team getting ex-
perience for the Nationals in May." 

As if being the most popular 
man on Earth wasn't enough 
for Mr. NBA. Jordan now 
wants to give baseball a shot in 
the same city where he became 
God - Chicago. How 
convenient.

After playing well against a Di-

the UCSD men' s tennis team ex-
pected an even better performance 
last Sunday against Division n Cal 
Poly San Luis Obispo. Unfortu-
nately, expectations were not ful-
filled. 

Triton..Head Coach Tim Ditzler 
could only watch helplessly as his 
team was summarily dismantled, 9-
0, by the visiting Mustangs. 

From top to boUom, bright spots 
were few and far between as the 
Tritons' record dropped to 0-2 to 
start the season.

In singles play, the outcomes 
were especially bleak, 
with only two Tritons 
able to tally more than 
two games away from 
their opponents. 

Number-one John 
Cross had the best per-
formance ofthe day, fail-
ing 6-2, 6-3 to Mark 
Ollivier.

four Dan Brounstein: loss 6- I, 6-1. 

Jeff Young, playing in the num-
ber-five spot, broke the 
one-game monotony 
when he dropped his 

. match 6-2, 6-2. 
However, the zeroes 

popped up again with 
Anand Shah's number-
six spot stumbling -
6-0,6-1 

"[The Mustangs] 
weren't as good as [Di-
vision I] USD," Cross 
said. "I don 't know what 
happened." 

"It was a very 
uninspiring singles per-

formance," Ditzler added. "But we 

started coming together in doubles." 
Despite losing the first set 6-0, 

Cross and Vernell bounced back to 
make the second set a contest in the 
number·one doubles spot, eventu-
ally falling, 7-6. 

Enthusiasm from new players in 
the lineup made the number·two 
and three doubles competitive. 
Young teamed up with sophomore 
Eric Steidylmayer, playing in his 
first collegiate match, to keep Cal 
Poly on its toes. The tandem eventu-
ally fell 6-2. 7-6, but Ditzler was 
impressed.

UCSD Rugby Rocks Waves 
PEPPIERED: Rugby drowns host Pepperdine, 17-5, improves league mark to 1-0 
By Jeremey M ••• med 
Guardian R~porte' 

After a promising preseason, the 
UCSD rugby team was more than 
eager to get league play underway. 

Shooting for a Soutern Califor-
nia Rugby Football Union Colle-
giate Division (SCRFU) league title 
and a trip to the playoffs, the San 
Diegans began their quest last Sat-
urday, traveling to the picturesque 
beaches of Malibu to do battle with 
the Pepperdine Waves in their 1994 
league opener. 

UCSD, looking to send a strong 
message to the rest of the league, 
turned in a dominating all-around 
effort and returned home with a con-
vincing 17-5 victory. 

San Diego controlled the tempo 
from the onset, but just couldn't put 
any points on the board. At first it 
didn't take junior Tim Gifford long 
to initiate the UCSD scoring bo-
nanza, breaking free from the pack 
on a weak-side run that left the 
Pepperdine players frozen in their 
tracks. 

ACED: UCSD 
off to a SLO start 
Continued from Pac. 9 
sion 11 team, I thought he 
[Steidylmayer] played very well," 
Ditzler said. 

Shah and junior Damon Brady 
rounded out the scoring with a 7-6, 
6-3 loss. 

injuries to the Triton veterans 
will thrust UCSD's rising newcom-
ers into more important roles as the 
season continues. 

Roy Gessford, normally playing 
in the number-three singles spot, 
was the latest player to land on the 
injured list. A twisted ankle pre-
vented him from participating in 
last weekend's contest. 

The Tritons' upcoming schedule 
certainly won't heal any of the 
teams' wounds. After this weekend's 
USD Tourney, the team hosts Cal 
Lutheran in its Division III opener. 

"We'll try to implement indi-
vidual style-type things we've been 
working on [for the toumamentl," 
Ditzler said. 

The Tritons will play nine of the 
top 10 Division ill teams before the 
season is over. 

"We've got one of the toughest 
schedules in the nation. if not the 
toughest." Ditzler said. 

"Gifford made a smart decision. 
That was the turning point for us in 
the game," junior Devon Shea said. 
"We were dominating them but 
couldn't score. That got us going." 

Going, going, gone was more 
like it. UCSD began converting 
scores at will while keeping the 
Waves offense at bay. 

"The score doesn't renect how 
much we controlled them," Shea 
said. "We made them hurt." 

Veterans Greg "Cheddar" 
Hughes and Chris Wacker led the 
wall-like San Diego defense whije 
Gifford took care ofbusiness on the 
offensive end, scoring two tries. 
Shea helped bury the Waves by nail-
ing all his kicks. 

UCSD's younger players once 
again turned in slrong outings. A 
relatively inexperienced squad, San 
Diego starts seven rookies. Morgan 
Pattison, Brian Harvey, and "linle 
man" Andy Lin all played with 
great intensity and filled in the gaps 
nicely for UCSD. 

"The rookies stepped up and 

played really well for us," Shea said. 
'They all played above their heads." 

UCSD wil! need consistent play 
from its youngsters throughout the 
season if its run for the playoffs is to 
prove successful. 

Making the playoffs will not be 
an easy task for the San Diego con-
tingent, which competes in a league 
that includes such West Coast pow-
ers as Loyola Marymount. UC Irvine 
and USD. 

"This is a rebuilding year for us, 
Shea said. "We moved down from 
the university to the collegiate divi-
sion, but there is still plenty of strong 
competition." 
- The rugby players remain opti-
mistic and feel they are ready to 
challenge forthechampionshipand, 
in the meantime, bring an air of 
much deserved respect to a program 
that few people know exists. 

UCSD hosts Claremont College 
this Saturday at 1:00 p.m. at the 
Warren fields.

San Diego Ski Teams Plow 
Through Rivals at Mammoth 
ByTrllvIa ..... 
Guardian Reporter 

With sUIUlY skies and 70-degree 
weather. most of UCSD's c1imate-
spoiled population isn't dwellins on 
the ill tides of winter, 
let alone mounds of 
snow. The same can't 
be said for the UCSD 
ski team. 

Last weekend, the 
squad competed in its 
third meet of the sea-
son at Mammoth 
Mountain against 
UCLA, USC, San Di-
ego State and eight 
other schools from the 
Southern California 
Collegiate Ski Conference. 

With fresh snow from two recent 
storms covering the ground, the 
scene was set for an excellent day on 
the slopes, and UCSD capitalized. 

The team continued its impres-
sive string of performances this sea-
son by placing in all of the weekend's 
events. Thanks to the performances 
of freshman Stephan Mueller ..w 

Soon Goode, the men's team ca~ 
tured sixth in the Slalom. With the 
help of teammate Kevin Bates, 
UCSD was also able to finish founh 
in the Giant Slalom. 

In the women's 
events, San Diego took 
second ploce in the Gi-
ant Slalom with strong 
showin1ts from Soraya 
Haeri, Chariee 
McCullough and Stacey 
Mullins. McCullough 
and Haeri helped the 
women seize third place 
overall in the Slalom, 

Currently, the 
women's team holds 
third place in all-around 

competition, behind USC and 
UCLA. The men's team is in fourth 
place behind UCSB, Cal Poly SLO 
and USc. With combined men's 
and women's tOlals, UCSD ranks 
second place in the conference. 

UCSD hosts the next race week-
end at Mammoth on Feb. 12-13 and 
look to prepare for regionals the 
following weekend. 

UCSD Assails Newport Bay 
Regatta With Top-10 Showing 
NO JIB: Giselle Camet tallies second-place fmishes 
By Ted L8dd 
Guardian Report~' 

The AFC won't win a Super 
Bowl. The Dallas Mavericks won't 
win again. The National 4ague 
won't win an All-Star game. And 
UCSD sailor Giselle Camet won't 
finish lower than second place in a 
regatta, 

These statements all seem to hold 
true. especially afterthe UCSD sail-
ing team's impressive performance 
in last weekend's Newport Bay Re-
gatta. 

Among the 18 schools compet-
ing, the San Diego sailors easily 
finished in the top lOin the South 
Series I and II races. 

'Thecrew,besideshavingtohold 
the jib sheet, really has to help with 
tactics in a race like this," co-ca~ 
tain Josh Feldman said. 

The team had to showcase all of 
its skills in the challenging sausage-
shaped course. 

UCSD sailors first had to tack 
upwind in their 15-foot Flying Jun-
iors before returning downwind in 
the final leg of the race,

San Diego was led by Camet's 
boat, which garnered several sec-
ond-place honors. 

Feldman rounded out the scor-
ing with sixth, eighth and tenth. 
place finishes. 

"We've got a lot of new sailors 
this year," Feldman said. "And we're 
also a lot more organized." 

Aside from new talent and orga-
nization, UCSD's sailing success 
can be attributed to experience. 

Camet is a former Olympic sailor 
from Argentina who brings much-
needed experience to UCSD sail-
ing. In addition, continued support 
from sponsor Darcy Bingham has 
boosted the team's morale. 

Although UCSD owns only three 
boats, a mere trifle in comparison to 
Stanford's 17, the team is large 
enough to sport both a varsity and 
junior varsity squad. 

UCSD will host the South Series 
V and VI races later this year. but in 
the meantime the 15-member sail-
ing squad continues to practice ev-
ery Monday and Friday afternoon lit

JORDAN: Face 
the chin music 
ContInued from .,.,. 9 
game. But baseball'? 

Baseball is a team game, with 
team concepts. Unlike tlis basket-
ball career, where he routinely 
grabbed the rebound. dribbled past 
everybody and dunked from the free-
throw line, baseball requires unself-

'1shness, the willingness to "take one 
for the team." 

By his very nature, it seems that 
Jordan would have severe difficulty 
if the spotlight were not on him each 
and every second, 

Can you imagine Jordan going 
0-4 with 2 strikeouts, an error and a 
caught-stealing? Can you see Jor-
dan coming off the bench in the 
ninth to pinch run for Ron 
Karkovice? How about Jordan 
bunting? I think not. 

And what if Randy Johnson de-
cided to gi ve his Aime~ a little chin 
music as a welcoming gift into the 
league. It's a good thing Nolan Ryan 
retired, for Jordan's sake. 

"It's something that I've always 
wanted to do," Jordan hu said 

OIl, stm:. It', so easy when you 
haven't a financial care in the world, 
when you can follow your aspira-
tions without wonyin. about the 
potential conaequenc:el, Yeah, 
Mlc:hael, go ahead. Do whatever 
you want. It' 5 a be country.
