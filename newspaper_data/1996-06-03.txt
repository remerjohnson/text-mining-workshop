UCLA Votes 'No' 
On Feminist Group 
LOS ANGELES - The UCLA 
Undergraduate Council voted 
May 28 to deny the :'Womynist 
Collective," a campus feminist 
group, authorization to operate 
as a student-advocacy group. 
The collective has alleJ)'lpted for 
the last year to gain official 
recognition from UCLA's 
student government. Council 
President York Chang said 
unclear guidelines for sponsor-
ship and poor timing led to the 
collective losing by only one 
vote.

Brown Student 
Appeals Suspension 
PROVTDENCE, R.I. -
Brown Univer 'ity tudent 
Adam Lack was suspended for 
a semester following a May 3 
incident in which he was 
accused of sexual misconduct 
involving non-consensual 
physical contact of a sexual 
nature. The student who 
accused Lack was reportedly 
intoxicated to the degree that 
she could not give consent. 
She claimed she has no 
memory of the night. Lack 
admitted that he initially found 
the woman lying next to a pool 
of her own vomit, but said that 
she was coherent enough to 
follow him back to his room, 
make sexual advances and 
request that he use a condom. 
Lack is appealing the suspen-
sion.

UCSD Astronomer Discovers Chemical in 
Comets that May Shed Light on Universe 
ETHANE: Spectrometer shows 
unexpected presence of 
molecule in comet Hyakutake 
By Karen Stron. 
Guardian Reporter 

UCSD astronomer Marina Fomenkova, along 
with a nationwide team of scienli t , recently 
discovered ethane in the heart of the comet 
Hyakutake - a discovery which may provide 
scientists with clues about the hi tory of the uni-
verse. 

Hyakutake, which dazzled observers this 
March, was the brightest comet to treak by Earth 
in two decades. Comet , which consist mostly of 
ice intermingled with tiny dust particles, evolved 
in very cold regions of space at the arne ti me that 
this planetary system was formed. This makes 
them well-preserved specimens of the pre-solar 

system - or natal - environment. 
Hyakutake's pa sing was fortuitous for the 

astrophysic community, which utilize recently 
developed, extremely sensitive cryogenic infra-
red instruments that better analyze the chemical 
composition of comets. 

Using NASA's Infrared Tele cope Facility at 
Mauna Kea, Hawaii , the team of NASA and uni-
versityastronomer. initially analyzed Hyakutake 
for water, carbon monoxide and methanol. 

The scientists discovered ethane while search-
ing for the presence of methanol, according to 
Michael A. DiSanti of NASA and the Catholic 
University of America in Washington, D.C_ 

"The initial spectral lines of methanol were 
much weaker than expected, so we decided to 
search for stronger lines," he said. "But after re-
setting the spectrometer, instead of seeing metha-
nollines we discovered ethane."

Medical Center 
Employees! 
Work Despite 
Unclear Future 
CUTS: Admini trators 
refuse to release exact 
number of iayoffs to date 
By Terry Lew 
Associate News Editor 

Many UCSD Medical Center employee 
walk out the hospital 's Hillcrest doors every 
night,wondering if their jobs will sti ll be 
there when they return in the morning. 

As layoffs and reductions of working 
hours continue at the beleaguered hospital 
complex, medical center administrators ex-
pectto post a $20.3 million loss forthe fi scal 
year that end June 30, 1996. 

Administrators hope to make up the hort-
fall by cUlling 500 positions from the hospital 's 
payroll, thereby saving $20 million. 

Although administrators refuse to release 
the exact number of layoffs so far, UCSD 
Health Sciences Communications Director 
Leslie Franz said reports of mass firings 
were greatly exaggerated. 

"/t 's important to stress that the numbcrof 
people that will be laid off is much less than 
500," Franz said. "Through a number of differ-
ent ways, we are finding ways to reduce our 
payroll that does not require 500 layoffs." 

However, because each position may be 
occupied by more than one part-time or per 
diem employee, Franz admitted th~t "the 
number of people whose jobs are affected 
may be more than 500." 

Almo t every medical-centerdepartment 
has been impacted by the layoffs and reduc-
tions in hours, which Franz expects to con-
tinue through July. 

"In the last couple of days, we had a 
couple of per diem nurses laid off," clinical 
nurse Gloria Bustamante aid. "It's defi-
nitely impacted morale." 

Bustamante added that the medical 
center's employees are doing their best to 
cope with their uncertain future . 

"I've been here 22 years, and I don't feel 
safer than anyone el e," Bustamante aid. 
"Everyone is working very hard, trying to 
regroup, keep our morale up and keep our 
patient focu ."

mine, who is graduating this year,

should tell you something about 
the impact the council has had on 
this campus.

UCSD CHARTER SCHOOL IS ILL-CONCEIVED 
Editor: 

The recent soaping of the foun-
tain at the Price Center, presum-
ably by those Sigma Nu guys if 
one is to draw a correlation 
between the Greek letters burned 
into the lawn and the nying soap 
bubbles, reminds me of the recent 
proposal for a UCSD high school. 

I think that proposing a high 
school at UCSD is an act of con-
ceit on the part of UCSD adminis-
trators. It implies several things. 
First, that the San Diego School 
District does not prepare students 
for college. Second, that to be a 
good college student it is neces-
sary to have a college-like educa-
tion beyond Advanced Placement 
courses prior to college. Third, 
that UCSD can provide a social-
ization process sufficient to nur-
ture nascent teens into mature 
adults who are ready for a serious 
academic school. 

Add to these views the notion 
that by plucking disadvantaged 
youths from their neighborhoods 
and busing them to UCSD we will 

instill into them a sense of acade-
mic purpose and loyalty to UCSD. 

Recall that UCSD has a prob-
lem attracting disadvantaged stu-
dents (i.e., those from low-income 
backgrounds or whose parents 
never went to college) to its acad-
emic program. The placement of 
high school students at UCSD will 
supposedly solve this problem. 
This group of charter-school stu-
dents will provide up to 100 appli-
cants a year to the university that 
have been taught at UCSD, and 
who are therefore quali fied by 
association to attena UCSD. 

The disservice to any students 
chosen for this high school is 
unimaginable. First of all, one 
point of going to college is to see 
the world from someone el e 's 
point of view. These students wi II 
have eight years of the UCSD per-
spective (poor guys). So long as 
they last five years and show up 
on the UCSD admission statistics, 
their contribution will be com-
plete. 

Second, UCSD will probably

developed, for whatever reason. 
will still remain behind. 

If UCSD truly wants to help 
high school students, UCSD 
administrators should approach 
the professionals involved in 
teaching high school students and 
ask, "What can we do within our 
infrastructure to prepare all stu-
dents for the university?" I expect 
that the San Diego School Di trict 
wi!! reply with three or four pro-
grams before UCSD completes the 
question. 

UCSD should offer to start 
an<ilor participate in the suggested 
programs at high schools with the 
highest percentages of disadvan-
taged students. I would imagine 
that UCSD would be more than 
welcome to add il s un ique view-
point to any program that it assists 
with. 

The students from these pro-
grams who choose to go to college 
and wish to stay in San Diego can 
apply to UCSD and be con idered 
along with all the other applicants. 
If not, they can go to another 

excellent school and UCSD can 
hope that they will return for grad-
uate studies.

6 OPINION 

TIME: Leaving 
college is hard to do 
Continued from pace 4 
wonder if they realize that in just 
four short years, they will be thrust 
into a world with no free time and 
no friends nearby," I used to ask 
myself. "And I wonder if they 
understand thal the more friends 
they make at school, the more 
friends they have to tearfully pan 
from once it's all over." The 
answers to these questions are 
undoubtedly "No," but I'm sure 
they will be "Yes" when these now-
freshmen are faced with the fore-
boding shadow of graduation. 

For me, freshman year was akin 
to one giant slumber party. For the 
first time in our lives, we were 
allowed to stay up or stay out as 
long as we wanted. It was as if our 
friends were sleeping over every 
nigh!. The ensuing years were even 
better. You could actually choose 
with whom you wanted to live. You 
were living with your best friends. 

Sadly, though, such insight only 
comes to me in retrospect. That is, 
only now do I realize that iI's clear 
what makes college enjoyable. One 
thing stands out above the rest: 
friends. This is what makes leaving 
so painful. 

Leaving high school meant we 
were leaving friends, but going to a 
place where we oould quickly malt-
ing new ones. Now, most of us are 

. 

THE END: 
ContInued from '. 4 time, three-fourths of UCSO's stu-
dent body chooses 10 ignore the A.S. 
completely - I oouldn't understand 
why its members were 90 uncooper-
ative with the media. 

Please understand: These are 
public officials. Public officials, by 
their very nalure, should want to get 
their message out to the people. The 

leaving friends but don't stand 10 
make many new ones because we'll 
be spending most of our waking 
lives in an office. 

However, this does not have 10 
be a time for depression. The poten-
tial does exist for graduates to lead a 
life that is better than what they had 
in college. After all, we are getting a 
degree from UCSD. 

Even though we are told over 
and over again thatthili is one of the 
finest schools in the nation and thal 
we should be proud to attend it, we 
denigrate it every day. UCSO's own 
students mock its administration, its 
student body, its professors, its 
classes and its campus. In reality, 
they should observe matters in a 
comparative light. How many pe0-
ple actually get 10 graduate from a 
school with a reputation as good as 
UCSO's in the first place? 

Beyond that, just look at whe.·! 
we live. Even if your college career 
netted you no friends, a 1.7 GPA, 
and a social life consisting of 
evenings spent on-line, at least you 
were doing it all in San Diego. 

Some students express distaste 
for San Diego because it has no 
social life - because iI's nOl a "col-
lege Iown." They missed that mag-
ical atmosphere that most college 
students e~perience with colleg .. 
athletics and towns that actually 
know there is a university nearby. 
But what did these people expect at 
UCSO? I chose this school pRlCise-
Iy because it was in La 101la, and 

main medium for this message is 
often a newspaper. Yet, to get the 
commissioner of programming to 
say three words about an upcoming 
concert necessitated an act of God. 
(This, ironically, was the same 
requirement for many of the office's 
events to get off the ground.) 

Instead of elucidking what hap-
pened during their weekly smug-
fests, A.S. councilmembers spent a 
disgusting amount of time criticizing

Even I have been accused of 
occasionally questioning the ulti-
mate worth of UCSD, and of a col-
lege education in general. But such 
rhetoric can be accounted for as the 
natural consequence of an opinion 
column in a college newspaper, and 
as the expected recourse of one 
about to enter the unstable world of 

·work. 
But think of all the possibilities 

that lie ahead. Every person who 
manages to graduate from UCSD, 
still has a lifetime of opportunity 

the Guatditua, or reacting 10 an arti-
c�e that had run in its pa&eS. This was 
a typical occum:nce, and a typical 
waste of their constituents'lime and 
money. But, you see, student money 
was in no short supply for A.S. use 
this year. And meanwhile - in the 
words of many of the A.S.'s "social-
ly conscious" officers - low-
income students were being shut out 
of hip education. Hmm.

ahead, even if he hasn't yet secured 
a high-paying job. Virtually every 
graduate is still young enough 10 
achieve his ultimate dream, and that 
is what he should strive 10 do. 

Settling for an office job, even if 
it pays well, is a waste of potential 
and life. (If you want an office job, 
then go for it by all means.) The last 
four years have given me a taste for 
what I want: free time 10 do what I 
enjoy. I will eventually find that, 
even if it requires a few interim 
positions, such as Chicl~ seller in 
Tijuana or La 10lla street bum 
scrounging up change from mall 
fountains for dinner at Taco Bell. 

I don't expect the bulk ofUCSD 
students to agree with me at this 
point. Only imminent graduates 
and the most insightful people can 
properly arrange their priorities -
friends, free time and one's sur-
rounding environment at the top, 
and complaints about life at the bot-
10m. 

In other words, for those under-
classmen who already have the log-
ical capacity to listen to a voice of 
reason when they hear one, do not 
be discouraged by the masses of 
ignorant and uninterested students 
who fail to question what they 
learn, lapping everything up like a 
six-month-old puppy at obedience 
school. 

And do not be discouraged by 
the more-interested but equally 
ignorant masses that choose to 
champion silly, clic~ "college" 

But let's not dally on the A.S.'s 
wasteful habits. Let's talk IIbout 
their ignorance on the subject of 
journalism. Despite that its highest-
ranking officer tried 10 make the 
Guatrlian office I second home -
drawn 10 it, no doubt, by the quali-
ties devoid in council chambers all 
year - the A.S. still oouldn't tell 
libel from lobotomy, cutline from 
cuticle, or misquote from misan-
thrope .

MondAy, June 3, 1996 

issues like affinnative action and 
"social justice," as if they under-
stood what those issues actually are. 
Bear in mind that no one really lis-
tens to these people. 

The A.S. and ocher cute little 
activist groups have been promising 
change for years. They will soon 
move out of an environment where 
their vocal protests win the desired 
pats on the back from a few fellow 
students into a world where ideas 
such as socialism and military cut-
backs are illogical. Like the rest of 
us, they will eventually accept real-
ity. 

At that point, they will also real-
ize that humans are individuals 
who are concerned with their own 
welfare before that of others. This 
does not mean that people don't 
care. They just understand that life 
is unfair and that they will do best 
to look after their own family 
before trying to save the world. 
Yes, even UCSO's activists will opt 
for the typical office job once it pre-
sents them with enough money and 
perks. Then we will see that they 
are ultimately self-interested as 
well. 

Indeed, it may be difficult even 
for the rational students to remain 
sane amidst such apathy and fool-
ishness. But I implore you to look 
at the big picture. Despite all the 
distractions, college is still the best 
time of our lives and we should 
enjoy it while we can. But for some 
of us, our time is up. It's over. 

It's the misquote thing that 
always got me. The reason that their 
whining confused me was that most 
of their quotes were - how shall I 
put it? - caught on tape. 

I'll admit that some GUJUdian 
writers may have mistakenly put the 
wrong quotes in the wrong place, or 
may have trimmed a dull A.S. offi-
cer's speech. But come on, people. 
It's time 10 face the facts. You said

SOUND BUSINESS PRACTICES LACKING AT CHE 
., ..... fIottI .... 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

The Cite Cafe has been having 
financial difficulties for quite some 
time. And it is no wonder - they 
have absolutely no idea how to run 
a business. A business that cannot 
be counted on is about as worthless 
as a date who stands you up, and it 
ranks just below cockroaChes in 
the hierarchy of species. If those 
who run the Cite want to keep it 
open, they must adopt more profes-
sional standards. 

Imagine traveling out of your 
way to patronize a business only to 
find that they just didn't feel like 
opening that day. Would you con-
tinue to go there? For at least the 
second time this calendar year, 
those who made the long trek 
across campus to the Ch~ last 
Wednesday hoping to partake of its 
"All We Can Eat" were greeted by 
a dark building, without even a 
note of explanation to placate the 
aggrieved masses. 

If this were an isolated incident, 
it might be excused. However, the 
proprietors of the Ch~ Cafe engage 
in a consistent pattern of inepti-
tude, thus showing a lack of 
respect for their customers and the 
student body that pays to support 
them. 

It seems quite appropriate that 
they call their feast an "All We Can 
Eat." For, as anyone who has 
attended these can attest to, they do 
not provide all you can cal. They

you thought. "It must have been a

Which brings me to journalistic 
rule number one: You can't say 
something is "off the record" after 
you say it - no matter how stupid it 
sounds or how drunk you were when 
you said it. Rule number two close-

If the price were some great 
bargain, diners would nOC feel as 
slighted, but at fi ve dollars it is 
hardly that. They don't even bother 
to accept the Plus card. 

Surely the decrepit atmosphere 
of the Ch6 also keeps many people 
away. Most people prefer coffee-
houses with a homey feel, includ-
ing couches and used tables and 
chairs. But the CtJe has taken this 
concept a bit too far. It just doesn't 
feel like home - it 's more like 
your donn room at the end of the 
year when no one has bothered to 
clean it for many months. 

A coffeehouse should be a 
pleasant place to hang out, talk or 
study. The lighting at the Che is 
not adequate for these tasks. In the 
winter it is so cold in there that one 
must exert all of one's energy ju t 
to stay warm, with none left for 
absorbing textbook material. 

Everyone understands that the 
CM is a hangout for leftist radicals 
(and federal fugitives, two of 
whom have been arrested there in 
as many years), and that doesn't 
bother most people. But that docs 
not mean they have an automatic 
right to run a restaurant and caf~ 
and to subsidize it with our student 
fees. They must make an effort to 
be more professional.

order to spruce up the place. It 
doesn ' t need to look like 
Starbucks. If it had the atmosphere 
of, say, The Living Room, many 
more students would want to hang 
out there. Of course, if they added 
heat, customers wouldn't have to 
order as many hot drinks, but all 
the new customers would make up 
for the lost sales. 

The Che is also badly in need of 
a publicity campaign. It does a fair-
ly decent job of publicizing its 

people extends much further. 
Indeed. this campus creates a safe 
haven for professors whose activi-
ties have absolutely no free-market 
value, and it gives various strange 
and lazy human beings a place to 
congregate - as university workers. 

I can't I:omplain too much about 
the academic types. I was blessed 
with a wonderful professor-mentor 
who led mc through my major with 
understanding and patience. 
However, I can complain about what 
I call the "dirty-old-man syndrome." 
This disease mainly amicts litera-

Wednesday evening meals and 
occasional concerts, but the major-
ity of students have no idea that 
they are open as a coffeehouse 
most evenings. Ask students where 
they can go to find a cup of coffee 
at 11 p.m. and the common answer 
would be Espresso Roma. Ask 
them where to get some Java after 
I a.m. and someone's Mister 
Coffee machine is the only answer 
you ' ll be likely to hear. The Ch~ is 
open until 2 a.m. (supposedly), but 
few know about it. 

In addition to some strategically 
placed 'This Way to the Che " 
signs around campus, those 
responsible might consider replac-
ing one or more of the murals that 
decoratc the Che building with 
some useful information, such as 
the fact thatthc oversized outhouse 
is the home of a cafe. They might 
even deign to post their hours. 

Currently, those dri ving or 
walking by the Chc would be hard-
pressed to figure out what :tctually 
goes on inside there. The people 
who run the Che probably think 
that they can ex ist as a business 
without customers. This is a mis-
take. 

The Chc needs advice from a 
professional schooled in institu-
tional food services. Wendy's does-
n't run out of burgers. Round Table 
doesn ' t run out of pizza dough. Top

The university rewards these

food-service operation could 
advise the Ch~ on how to anticipate 
demand, how to start cooking more 
food far enough in advance so that 
shortages don't occur and other 
intricacies of running a restaurant. 

It just isn't co~t-effective to 
serve cooked meals only once a 
week. The Ch~ should work 
toward serving food every nigh!. 
This would eliminate the problem 
of large crowds eating them out of 
stock on a single night, and would 
make the food operation more 
manageable. And if an all-you-can-
eat policy is deemed impractical, a 
per-plate or per-serving charge 
should be instituted instead. This 
would attract more light caters, 
who feel the current one-price-fits-
all does not lit them. 

Although many of the people 
who hang out at the Che Cafe 
might deny this fact vehemently, 
the 1960s are over. The university 
and its students cannot continue to 
throwaway good mone),. If people 
want a place to discuss the coming 
socialist revolution, give them a 
cubicle in the Old Student Center. 
If they want to run a caf~ and 
restaurant, then they must run it

tomer as king. Otherwise, the Chc 
building and student funds should 
be put to better use.

any feathers by doing their job too 
well. They bicker like linle dictators, 
butting heads over their temlOries. 
They feed off people who do all the 
real work and pay their salaries: the 
students. 

To make matters worse, firing a 
university employee requires more 
paperwork than a government grant, 
and is like trying 10 pull your upper 
lip over your head. In other words, it 
just doesn't happen that often. Make 
no mistake, if it weren 't for the pro-
tective aegis of the university, these 
people would be out of work. 

We .......... ", ....... 
But you can't blame university 

employees too much for their atti-
tudes. After all, they're taking what 
they 're allowed 10 take. The same 
can be said for UCSO's numerous 
"ethnic" clubs. Each year, the cha-
rade continues as every organization 
from the Asian-Pacific Islander 
Association 10 the African-American 
Student Union asks for, and 
inevitably receives, a huge chunk of 
student money from the A.S. 

This money is then used to put on 
exclusive dances, events and panies. 

I can't unden:mphasiz.e the meaning 
of the word "exclusive." Sure, other 
races and religions can attend these 
gatherings. Sure, the doors are open 
to whoever wants to attend. But 
that's not the point. UCSO's "eth-
nic" clubs aren't for all people. 
They're meant to exclude others and 
fractionalize the campus - that's 
why they 're named that way. 

I dare a group of white, beer-guz-
zling, chauvinistic men to go to the 
A.S. and ask for student money to 
start up a "White Men's Club." 
Anyone could attend the meetings. 
these men would claim, but the 
name and mission of the club wou Id 
not change. (Some might argue that 
these organizations already exist in 
the form of fratemities). 

Watch the A.S. Council's 
response: The officers will sit there, 
flabbergasted as to how they can 
logically deny funding 10 this group. 
Then maybe, just maybe, they ' ll 
realize that some student organiza-
tions aren't so inclusive. Maybe 
they'll see that if people want to be 
exclusive about. things, they can 
charge their own dues. Who am I 
kidding? It'U never happen. 
........... 

Mh, the joy of campus activism. 

The UCSO Guardian 

I've gollO hand it 10 those silly pro-
testets: They brought humor 10 my 
life and a smile to my face. The 
highlight had to be the "Freedom 
City" fiasco, followed closely by the 
noble efforts of activists last March 
to block an intersection in La Jolla. 
Now that's a statement. 

Of course, as soon as it came 
time 10 face the music - to pay a 
fine or serve jail time for their deeds 
- they cried conspiracy. "We're 
victims of the Republicans again!" 
they moaned. "They must be behind 
this somehow!" 

The saddest thing, however, is 
that these activists actually feel like 
they're helping people. They think 
that minorities and underrepresented 
students are actually benefiting from 
their self-promoting actions. Perhaps 
these activists should look to them-
selves as perpetuators of the stereo-
types that they so vehemently 
oppose. 

How else can their activism pos-
sibly make hard-working, intelligent 
minorities feel? "You're totally dif-
feren .... these activists are saying. 
"You aren't smart enough to get inlO 
college by your own merits. You 
don't need equal opportunities -
you need special opportunities. And 

we'll fight for your rights to be 
viewed as inferior in classrooms and 
worXplaces." These activists are 
seeking an end to discrimi nation, yet 
they want college admissions boards 
and employers 10 select people on 
the basis of race. [ don't get it. 

AIterMIIve ..: ........ 
Closely following on the heels of 

Sludenl activism is UCSO's version 
of a subsidized press: the alternative 
media. For the most part. reading 
these slightly off-kilter publications 
can be enlightening, informative and 
- yes - entertaining. 

But then there are those papers 
that have hung on over the years, 
publishing solely because they have 
a claim to the A.S. cash fund. These 
kind of papers - and I don't mean 
the Guardian, because we're inde-
pendently funded - continue to 
suck the alternative-media monies 
dry, despite only publishing a few 
times eyery few months, and on an 
irregular schedule. 

Take the Last Indicator, for 
example. It used to be UCSO's offi-
cial campus newspaper - that is, 
until a majority of students stopped 
reading it. Yet it still asks for the 
largest allocation of any publication 
on campus, and routinely gets it.

And for what result? 
Well, w(t get to see poor design 

techniques in action, writing 
drenched in typos and problems with 
grammar. We get confused articles 
about how we need 10 legalize mari-
juana for the common man, while 
nOl letting big corporations make it 
cheaply for the common man. And 
this is not to mention the constant 
babble about how corporations are 
taking over our lives, and the pull-
out posters championing commu-
nist, human-rights-violating 
regimes. 

But In ........... 
I guess I've written a lot of nega-

tive things. But that's because I've 
seen a lot of negative things. I've 
seen the Sun God Festival degener-
ate into a police state after two amaz-
ing parties my freshman and sopho-
more years - I mean, Blues 
Traveler played here, man. And until 
1:30 a.m., not II :30 p.m. 

I've had to deal with egos of 
Division ill athletes who expect the 
Guardimlto kiss their butts because 
of all the "sacrifice" they're going 
through. [' ve had 'to listen to these 
self-inflated, intramural sandbaggers 
whine about the slightest criticism 
because they' re not here on scholar-
ship. Excuse me: If you're not good 
enough to earn a Division I scholar-
ship, then don't expect to be treated 
like star athletes. II's your choice to 
play Division ill-level competition. 
It's your ability that got you here 
without a scholarship. 

Yet, there's always been more 
good than bad. I've been on the side-
lines of Jack Murphy Stadium for a 
Chargers' game. I've talked to peo-
ple from around the world. I've 
spent quality hours sitting down in 
Polter'S Pub and downing a few 
brews. I've questioned cops. I've 
caught people in lies. I've called up 
Blockbuster at 3 a.m. to ask for the 
spelling of "Snufalufagus." 

[' ve watched the sun rise over the 
Old Student Center on the way home 
from work. I've taken part in pro-
ducing a product that people read -
a product that, for better or for 
worse, affects UCSO. I've had the 
joy of secretly watching people pick 
up the Guardian, look it over, and

In The Beginning ... 
History of the UCSD Greek System 

If you are in a fraternity or sorority, you probably 
know when it was founded at UCSD. You might also know a 
little bit about how it was founded, but who can say that they 
know how the whole greek system at UCSD was started? 
This history is not documented well, and could only be found 
by speaking to those who were present at UCSD during the 
time of the greek system's conception. 

Although there are reports of a greek letter fraternity 
existing briefly in the 1960's on this campus, the first sem-
blance of a greek system began in the mid to late seventies 
with the formation of the first three sororities. Alpha Omicron 
Pi was founded in 1974 with Sigma Kappa following in 1978 
and Delta Gamma in 1980. Although the sororities were 
founded at an early date, it took a while before Pan hellenic 
was created to unite them, 

The birth of the fraternities was somewhat less ortha-
dox. During the late seventies and early eighties UCSD had a 
different atmosphere than it does today. Stories were told far 
and wide of the party atmosphere at UCSD. Amidst these 
surroundings arose a group called SOAP (Studends 
Organized for Alternative Programming), which held their tair 
share of "Alternative Programming" events. SOAP was start-
ed by Joe Formusa, Chris Arrot, and Carlos Montalvo in 
1979. One of the founders, Carlos Montalvo, participated in 
an exchange program with Dartmouth where he saw a very 
active greek system, and over time, SOAP grew to be very 
similar to a fratemity. In tact, the men of SOAP decided to 
take Delta Gamma to be their sister sorority, Although they 
could not find any greek organization that they identified With, 
one of the main goals ot SOAP was to start a greek system 
on campus. 

When the original members started to graduate, 
SOAP began to fade away. To fill the void, the first fraternities 
began to spring up. The first fratemities were Phi Delta Theta, 
TKE, and Delta Sig. In the early eighties, Randy Woodard 
r:-.t==:!:t:=~___ went betore the vice chancellor to ask for the creation 

, ~ of and Interfratemity Council. The chancellor agreed 
and the first three fraternities were joined together in an 
expansion process to select which fraternities were to 
be allowed into IFC. Panhellenic was also created at 
the same time and before long the greek system had 
blossomed into where we are today. -BD 

Delta Delta Delta Wins Wins Wins 
The PH Sports banner came down to two teams 

going into the softball toumament. Tri-Delta owned a 55 point 
lead over second place Delta Gamma and needed to win two 
games to clinch their second banner in four years. Failure of 
the. Tri-Delts to do this would result in a Delta Gamma victory 
provided that they finished in first or second in softball . It was 
over after the second round Tri Delta played Pi Phi. With a 
nine run lead going into the sixth Pi Phi looked to coast to the 
win, but a furious rally by the Tri Delts game red them a 12-11 
win as well as the Panhellenic Sports Banner. Tri-Delta wine 
on to defeat last year's banner champions, Kappa Kappa 
Gamma, 5-4 in the finals to finish their banner season. -SH

Sigma Chi Slides in for Third Straight 
Banner 

Sigma Chi finished the spring sports banner season 
with two impressive come-from-behind victories that gave 
them their third straight sports banner title. The Sigs had the 
chance to clinch it with two wins in Inner Tube Waterpolo, but 
a first round upset by Sigma Nu prevented any celebrations. 
Sigma Nu played Sig Ep, the three-time defending polo 
champions in the semifinals, but struggled to fight off the 
quick attack of Sig Ep and the final score was 11-9 Sig Ep. In 
the other semifinal, SAE played Delta Sig for a chance to go 
to the finals. With their big lineup, SAE controlled the entire 
game up and down the pool and posted an impressive 16-3 
win. The final game was the closest in the last three years 
with neither team able to grab a lead of more than two goals. 
With less than a minute to go the score was tied at 9-9, but a 
foul at mid-pool let to a quick SAE goal that put them up 10-
9. Sig Ep had several chances at a last second goal, but 
could not put the ball past SAE goalie Adam Vick. 

With the end of waterpolo, five fraternities still had a 
strong chance to take the banner, but all Sigma Chi had to do 
was win their first game in softball versus Sigma Nu. The 
game was close for several innings, but an explosion in the 
third by Sigma Chi gave them a lead that they were never 
close to relinquishing. With the victory, Sigma Chi won the 
Sports Banner for the third time, the others coming in 1994 
and 1995. The Sigs are the only active chapter at UCSO to 
have ever won the banner, as the first seven went to Phi 
Delta Theta. 

The rest of the softball competition was somewhat 
anticlimactic, but there were still three fratemities vying for 
the second-place position. In the semifinals Sigma Chi and 
Sig Ep squared off in a game that involved a lot of hitting. Sig 
Ep clung to a 12-6 lead after five innings but a five run sixth 
and a two run seventh gave Sigma Chi a 13-12 win. In the 
other semifinal game Beta played against a strong Pi 
Kapp team. The game became a real pitcher's duel 
with both teams having troubles getting men across the 
plate. Beta did a better job, though, and won 4-0. The 
championship was much the same as the semis for 
Sigma Chi as they spotted Beta a 7-0 lead and fought 
back with two big innings to tie the game going intc the 
seventh inning. Beta had the first chance and a highly 
disputed hit down the first base line was called foul that 
would have brought in two Beta runs. Instead they got zero. 
Bill McKnight led off the seventh for Sigma Chi and hit a shot 
to deep right center for a homerun that clinched the Sigs their

10 OPTNION The UCSD Guardian .. Monday: June 3, 1996 

AN OPEN LETTER TO THE UCSD COMMUNITY 
Editor: 

The proposal to establish a char-
ter high school at UCSO has gener-
ated strong interest both on-and off-
campu . I am happy to provide you 
with a status report. 

In late January, in response to a 
draft proposal presented by the 
Charter School Steering Committee 
chaired by Provost Cecil Lytle, I 
appointed an ad hoc faculty/admin-
istration work group to study fur-
ther the f,.~~ibility of a charter high 
school at UCSO. The work group 
was asked to address issues of criti-
cal importance to the successful 
operation of a public high school. 
These issues included, but were not 
limited to, budgets and revenues, 
administration and governance, 
program assessment , admission 
policies. size of student-body, loca-

tion, facilities, student social Ii fe, 
liability and insurance, support ser-
vices, community outreach and rel-
evance to UCSO's mission. 

I am indebted to the members of 
the work group for the thoughtful-
ness with which they undertook this 
task. The effort involved extensive 
consultation and required more 
research and analysis of complex 
issues than originally anticipated. ] 
have received their report, and am 
pleased to share its salient points 
and indicate the steps that we must 
follow in order to reach a decision 
regarding the proposed school. 

The report firmly holds that 
establishing a charter school fits 
with UCSD's three-fold mission of 
research, teaching and ervice, and 
that it represents "a bold experi-
ment in raising the college eligibili -

ty of disadvantaged high school stu-
dents." Let me emphasize, howev-

whether UCSD could successfully 
establish a charter school , not 
whether UCSD should. In other 
words, the report is an assessment 
of "what-would-it-take" rather than 
a plan for implementation, but it 
does conclude that the school is 
feasible given solid financial sup-
port. 

AI a minimum, this support 
must include a guaranlee of full 
start-up funding for the first five 
years of operation and provision for 
interim and permanent facilities.

ate the charter school," the repon 
concludes, "with the certainty that 
we have the resources to do it very ' 
well." 

Given the recommendations in 
the report, no decision has been 
made at this time as to whether we 
can, or should, proceed to establish 
a charter school. But if we are to 
reach a timely decision, we must 
follow up on multiple issues in par-
allel. 

While we are seeking endorse-
ment from the Academic Senate, 
approval from the Office of the 
President , and, most likely, 
approval from the Board of 
Regents, we must also continue dis-
cussions with the community and 
with the San Diego Unified School 
Distri ct regarding terms and condi-
tions of their involvement in, and 

financial support of, a charter high 
school. Efforts to secure stable 
funding must be made concurrently 
with external and internal planning 
involving the needed facilities, 
school ite, govemance and admin-
istrative policies. curriculum, 
admissions criteria and student 
recruitment, as weU as recruitment 
of schoo I personnel. 

Such a large number of parallel 
investigations requires the attention 
of an intemal management team 
which, 1 believe, should be appoint-
ed soon to provide planning details 
and other critical information on the 
development of a charter school. 
Every effort will be made by the 
campus leadership to inform you as 
to our progress.

Alexander said that she would 
like to give bands more playing time, 
hut "there's only eight bands and 
it's already four hour~ long." 

However, most of the audience 
seemed 10 have no qualms with the

ETHANE: 
Comets may have 
sowed seeds of life 
Continued from page 1 

Although methane had been pre-
viously theorized toexist in comets, 
the presence of ethane - a more 
complex substance - had never 
been proposed. 

''The discovery of ethane was a 
blinding surprise," said Michael J. 
Mumma of NASA 's Goddard Space 
Flighl Center. 

One theory that may explain the 
abundance of ethane is that icy grain 
mantl t:s that contain the molecule 
originated in the dense, natal cloud 
core. 

The mantles endured extreme 
conditions during the formalion of 
the solar system, such as ull raviolet 
(UV) radiation, high temperatures 
and high hydrogen-atom densi ties. 
Some of the mantles could then have 
undergone chemi ca l changes while 
st ill in a so lid phase. 

Previous laboratory studies us-
ing photolysis by UV radiation 
proved ethane could be produced 
from pure methane ice. Also, UV 
radiation ap plied to mixed waler 
and methane ices can yield carbon

dioxide and ethane. 
These di scoveries led astronomers 

to believe the cloud from which our 
planetary system was formed con-
tained a more complex variety of 
chemicals than previously suspected. 

The fact that Hyakutake' compo-
sition has a lower methanol-to-waler 
ratio compared to other comets also 
demonstrates the diversity among the 
comets and perhaps lhe nonunifonntty 
of the natal olar syslem cloud. 

This new information about the 
natal environment will allow scien-
tists to infer more about conditions 
of the early Earth. 

"Some theories hold that, For ex-
ample, all the walCr on Earth could 
have been brought here by comets 
when they bombarded the Earth be-
cause they are made up of about 50-
percent water." Fomenkovasaid. 'The 
same is true for organic malcria ls." 

Fomenkova added that comcts may 
have been in some way responsible 
for the development of life on Earth . 

"We now know that comets are 
rich in organic materi al and lhey 
have some rather complicated or-
ga ni chemistry, so they could have 
brought this pre-biotic material to 
the Earth - which then may have 
cont ri buted as sort of bui Idi ng blocks 
to the origin of life." 

Some LS~T prep co~panies p~e tend to offer you a rabbit 's foot 
for luck if you don t ta ke their course. We ftgure, if you don't 

t~ke o ur L~AT course, what you'd rather have is an exira $200, 
since that s h ow m uch more most of those other cou rses a re 
going to cost you . If you decide, however, Ihat you want to pay 
out a~l Iha t ex tra money to go to Ihe other guys, here a re a few 
queshons you should ask them fi rst: 

• If I'm payi.ng you 800 b~cks, why are you only giving 
me a fraction of the available LSAT practice questions? 

• Why do you pack so many students into one classroom? 

• If your instructors are so good, why don't you offer 
unlimited tutoring? 

• If your instructors are so good, why do you subject 
your students to taped lectures and explanations? 

• If your ~sul~s really have been verified by a big 
accounting fmn, why won't you back them up with a 
money-back guarantee?

LAYOFFS: 
Administrators 
defend decision 
ContInued from ..... 1 
enccs John Alksne recently posted a 
letter at several locations around the 
medical cencer that stated me quality 
of patient care would not suffer dur-
ing the restructuring. 

"We are making the changes we 
have undenaken very carefully to 
make sure that your care is not af-
fected," Alksne wrote. "Our staffing 
levels will continue to exceed the stan-
dard for patient care in thiS commu-
nity, even after we complete the 
planned staff reductions that wi \I oc-
cur as a result of our restructuring." 

The UCSD Medical Center cur-
rently has a staff-to-patit:nt ratio of 
approximately9-I,Fran7 aid, while 
the industry average is J.bout 5-1. 

Although Franz said the hospital 
can reduce staffing leveb somewhal, 
the higher ratio is in part because of 
the UCSD Medical Center's role a 
the only teaching hospital in the San 
Diego area. 

Many hospital employees, from 
patient-care to service areas, said 
they felt their years of loyal service 
were being cast aside. 

"People were here years - JUSt 
months from retiring. and manage-
ment basically dumped them," said 
a 19-year veteran clerk in the radia-
tion therapy department who pre-
ferred that her name not be used. 
"We have no idea what's next." 

The clerk, whosedepanmentlo t 
three people last Thursday, also cast 
doubts on the objective nature of the 
layoff decisions. 

"It seems like they're indiscrimi-
nately picking positions and saying, 
'We don't need that anymore," she ' 
said. "It makes you feel like they're 
really unpredictable. It puts everyone 
in a really uncomfortable setting." 

However, Franz said the "radical 
restructuring" was well-planned and 
that it is necessary to ensure the 
hospital's survival and future suc-
cess. 

'This was not developed over-
night," Franz said. "I have confidence 
that as painful and di fficult as this 
process is, we will have an organiza-
tion that is very strong and well-posi-
tioned to be a success in the future." 

However, some employees said 
they doubted administrators' pro-
fessed concerns. 

'They tell you you ' re safe one 
day, and the next they tell you the 
opposite," said a technologist's as-
sistant in the radiation-therapy de-
partment who also requested ano-
nymity. "[fhe three people who were 
laid off Thursday) were asked to 
clear out their desks the same day." 

Franz said many employees are 
being paid in lieu of 30-day notices. 

''They can use the time to begin 
looking for jobs and get their lives 
in order," she said. ''The intention is 
to give employees Ihe maximum 
time possible." 

Franz added that professional 
resume-building and job-search help 
is being made available to employ-
ees who are laid off. 

"Employees, as they receive their 
notices, are invited and even encour-
age to attend counseling sessions," 
she said. "We've found it to be a very 
helpful service for people whohaven't 
had to look for jobs in a while." 

Despite reassurances from ad-
ministration, many staff members 
feel all they can do is wait and see 
where the ax falls. 

"I've been here for 19 years, and I 
just hope for the bcst," unit secretary 
Ertinda Lopez said. ") put my job in 
God's hands. He'll do as he sees fit."

Scientist Named UCSD 
Alumnus of the Year 
HONOR: Goeddel 
received a B.A. from 
Revelle in 1972 
By Anand Patel 
Staff Writer 

In a $ignificant break from its t.ra-
dition of only honoring scholars who 
received their Ph,D,s at UCSD, lhe 
UCSD Alumni Associalion recently 
named nationally-renowned 
bioengineer David Goeddelthe OU[-
standing Alumnus of the Year for 
1996. 

Business Week 

After improving his grades during 
his final undergraduate years, Goeddel 
pursued graduate studies at the Uni -
versi ty of Colorado, Boulder, 

Goeddel wentontoeamaPh.D, in 
biochemistry from the University of 
Colorado, and became a postdoctoral 
fellow at the Stanford Research Insti-
tute in 1977, He later became the first 
full -time employee of Genentech, a 
San Francisco-based biotechnology 
company. 

Goeddel -who colleagues describe 
as a "kamikaze scientist" - often 
works 80-90 hours per week. He at-
tributes the excessive hours to the Goeddel , who 

magazine called 
"[The] industry 'S 
mOSI productive 
scientisl," said he 
was initially sur-
prised to receive 
lhe award because 
he left UCSD after 
receiving a 
bachelor's degree, 
bUI just was hon-
ored by the recog-

"There's nothing 
like seeing all the 
hours you put In

nology industry. 

"In this indus-
try, you cannot af-
ford to be second-
best," he said. 

Goeddel said 
he.p people." his years at 

_ David Goeddel Genenlech were a 
great ex perience, Outstanding Alumnus of the Year 
where he enjoyed 

ni lion. 
Goeddel attended Revelle College 

from 1968 to 1972 and ultimately 
received a bachelor of arts degree in 
chemistry , He was honored al lhe 
association 'sJune 15 Alumni Awards 
Banquet in the Geisel Library, 

Goeddel developed five drugs and 
ynthetic clones of natural substances 

in less than five years at Genentech, 
including human insulin, human-
growth homloneand tissue plasmino-
gen activator (TPA), an anli-clotting 
agent often used in heart-auack pa-
tients. 

"There's nothing like seeing all 
the hours you put in the lab re ult in a 
product that can help pcople," Goeddcl 
s~i d, 

Goeddel aid he attended UCSD 
for financial reasons and because it 
was close to his home in Poway. He 
added Ihal he enjoyed hi s undergradu-
ate years, describing himself as a 
"goor-off', 

working with some of the "best 
bioengineers of the time". 

''Those were great years," he said, 
"We were all young and eager," 

After 15 years at Genentech, 
Goeddel and acoupleofhi colleagues 
left in 1993 to create Tularik, lnc, -

Wacky Things to Do 
This Summer 

Summer vacation is delightfully near, 
yet woefully di stant for those of us who 
have to endure the hell of final exams 
before our we ll -deserved and long-awaited 
reprieve. With the exception of those 
unfortunate souls who will attend summer 
school, hold internships or work this sum-
mer to scrounge enough money to pay for 
their college education , most UCSD stu-
dents will probably spend the next three 
month s listlessly on the beach or channel-
surfing at home. 

For those anticipating an insipid vaca-
tion, the Guardian has compiled a list of 
activities to make this summer more enjoy-
able, and possibly more productive. 

If you have the money for gas, grab a 
light suitcase and take a cross-country road 
trip, A long drive can help you sort out 
some personal issues , 

Sports fans with money, and a lot of 
time to kill, can hit 28 baseball stadiums in

Students Approach 
Summer Differently 

In theory, summer should be both an 
exciting and relaxing break for students. 
Ideally, it is a time for beaches, road trips, 
ball games and general lounging, 

In practice, however, students rarely 
find summer vacation to be as exciting as 
they had originally envisioned. The cold, 
hard truth is that the dog-days of summer 
often involve a lot more books than beach-
es and a good deal more work than loung-
ing, especially for UCSD students, 

What are students doing during the 
vacation? The question was posed to a 
number of students, and the general con-
census was that summer is not necessarily 
much of a vacation at all. 

In fact, among other things, it is a time 
to get some work experience, earn some 
academic units and make a little money 
along the way - if possible,

SUMMER: 
Students talk about 
their plans 
ContInued from ..... 15 

School D.,. 
Summer vacation should be a 

break from school, but for a vast 
number of UCSD students like 
Muir junior Lori Schreier, it is a 
time to stick around campus and 
make up some units. 

"I'm going to both of the sum-
mer school sessions and taking 16 
units," Schreier said. "I'm a trans-
fer student, and I just added anoth-
er minor." 

Like many students, Schreier 
realizes thai it's tough to stay caught 
up with classes. During the rigors of 
the school year, it's easy to take on 
too much and end up having to drop 
a class. Going abroad or having a job 
would also make it difficult to carry a 
full load. As a result, students look 10 
the summer as a time to stay caught 
up on their four-, five- or however 
many- year program, whatever the 
case may be. 

Indeed, summer school is at the 
core of a number of students' plans, 
even for those who are going to be 
away from UCSD for awhile. 

"I'm going to summer school in 
Irvine, taking two classes," Warren 
freshman Eileen Fung said. "I'll be 
carpooling with my friends from 
LA. everyday." 

Other students, like Muir fresh-
man Jennifer Chang, will be going 
home. Unfortunately, her home is 
in San Diego, so she Cl/UIOt escape 
the vacuum of UCSD. 

"I'm basically going to stay at 
home and go to summer school," 
Chang said. "One or two classes, I 

haven't really thought about it yet." 
Nobody wants to attend sum-

mer school, but there is no doubt 
that it has its advantages. It is nice 
to just focus on one class amid the 
relatively lax pace that July and 
August bring to the campus. 
Get A Job 

Of course, for the more enler-
prising students, the break is a key 
time to get some work experience 
and, more importantly, eam some 
cash. 

Malt Levine, a Marshall sopho-
more, will work as an intern at the 
downtown San Diego office of 
Smith and Barney, a stock-broker-
age firm. 

" It makes $5 to $6 an hour, 20 
hours a week," Levine said. "I'm 
going 10 have to get another job to 
make money. If] just had that job I 
could take summer school, butI'm 
gonna need a second job." 

Internships, especially, are 
highly sought by UCSD students. 
For many, they offer an ideal 
opportunity to "test the waters" in a 
certain field. That way, they can 
decide whether or not it is an area 
to pursue in the future. 

Other students have more inter-
esting excuses for staying near 
school and working. 

"I just want to stay down here 
and get away from my parents," 
said prospective Starbucks 
employee Christian Wood. 

Marshall senior Sylvia Isaac 
will also stay near UCSD to work 
full time as a Course and 
Professor Evaluation (C.A.P.E.) 
editor, preparing next year's edi-
tion. 

"I'm going to try working at 
night," Isaac said. ''Then I can be in 
the sun during the day, since I work

in a basemenl I'm going to base-
ball garnes. I'll be at every game 
when the Dodgers come down 
here, hopefully." 

And, hey, what's summer with-
out camp? Mike Walsh, a Marshall 
sophomore, will be enjoying swim-
ming and crafts as a camp supervi-
sor at the Clover Leaf Ranch in 
Northern California. 

"I'll be in charge of all the coun-
selors and the activities that are 
going to happen," Walsh said. 
"There's certain night-time activi-
ties that we have to create each 
night, and two to three times a 
week there is a big one which takes 
most of the coordination." 

Fun, Fun, Fun " 
Marshall senior Foroud Tale-

Yazdi is one of the few students 
who actually gets to enjoy the 
"ideal" summer for which most 
students probably yearn. 

''I'm going to travel to Mexico, 
and then I'mjust gonna bum around 
and do nothing," Tale-Yazdi said. 

Because he graduates in June 
and moves on to graduate school in 
August, he has a month and a half 
to kill - not enough time to get a 
real job, but plenty to relax and 
take a trip. 

"I'm going to be home," Tale-
Yazdi said. "I want to travel around 
California, too, go up north with 

some friends." 
Warren senior Keith Yamano, 

an avid surfer who also is graduat-
ing, looks to personally recreate the 
"Endless Summer" movies by 
embarking on a surfing safari of his 
own. Chances are, with water tem-
peratures increasing, a number of 
others will be waxing their boards 
so that they can ride the "heavies." 

"I'm going to be doing a lot of 
surfing this summer," Yamano said. 

From surfing to summer school, 
UCSD students will be pursuing 
their own goals this summer, 
whether it be to ride the perfect 
wave, or get that elusive "C-" in 
Chemistry 6B.

VACATION: 
Zany suggestions 
for the summer 
Continued from pace 15 
30 days. Not only can you sur-
vey the various ballparks that 
sporadically · dot the country -
from Baltimore's Camden Yards 
to Seattle's monstrous Kingdome 
- but in the process you'll also 
get a taste of various metropolitan 
areas. 

The Red Hot Chili Peppers and 
Foo Fighters are touring this sum-
mer. Get acquainted with the life 
of a groupie by tagging along with 
the bands. 

Even if you are not a nature 
person, a hike up to the mountains 
can prove to be both physically 
and mentally reWarding. Meditate. 
Re-establish communication with 
your inner being. 

Exorcise your fears - this 
could be your summer to over-
come phobias. If you have a fear 
of heights, climb up to the balcony 
of your house. After you've con-
quered that challenge, work your 
way up to taller buildings. One 
suggestion for those of you who 
wish to overcome a fear of spiders 

The UCSD Guardian 

is to watch the film 
"Arachnophobia" repeatedly until 
desensitization is achieved. 

Avid talk-show fans can apply 
to be audience members of day-
time television fare such as ' 'The 
Ricki Lake Show," or fly to New 
York and watch 'The Late Show 
with David Leiterman" live. 

Expose yourself to culture. Attend 
and learn to appreCiate operas, wine 
tastings and art galleries. If you enjoy 
literature or theater, experience 
Shakespeare performances in the 
park. Read works by authors such as 
Chaucer, Dostoyevski and Faulkner. 

Make your mark in the world. 
Write the all-American novel or an 
autobiography. 

Relieve the tensions and nega-
tive energies that have accumulat-
ed during Ihe school year. Run 
buck naked in a field of lilies and 
feel as free as the wind. 

Indulge your taste buds. Try all 
of Baskin Robbins' 31 flavors over 
a span of 31 days - a flavor a day, 
beginning with basic vanilla 
(Calorie-counters need not apply). 
Place your television on the kitchen 
counter and follow along ~ith "Yan 
Can Cook." After you have mas-
tered Yan's art of cooking, promote 
yourself to Julia Child. By the end

Be a rebel and defy the laws of

should things go wrong, so liber-
ate the free spirit within. 

Get reacquainted with your 
body (no sexual implications 
intended, but that's your busi-
ness) . Shed your modesty and go 
skinny dipping. 

Daredevils can frequent all of the 
amusement parks in California. The 
new "Superman" ride at Magic 
Mountain is the first roller-coaster 
ride to exceed 100 mph. Universal 
Studio's "Jurassic Park" - the most 
expensive ride ever made - also 
opens this summer. 

Do the California thing. Surf 
the beaches of California, visit 
stale parks or bike across the state. 

Go spelunking (look it up; it 
will help you build your vocabu-
lary). 

Watch every summer movie, 
from "Independence Day" to 
"Striptease." 

Drive with reckless abandon on 
the highways of Montana - the 
only state without speed limits 
during the day. 

This summer, the world is your 
oyster. Invest in every opportuni-
ty to enrich yourself with priceless 
new experiences, because school 
resumes in three months and 
exams commence again.

was hoping to see. Now, we 
were forced to play the game, 
and my plan disintegrated into 
thin air. Not naming any names. 
our team was comprised of three 
or four good players, myself 
included. and others who lack 
balance and hand-eye coordina-
tion. Especially after they have 
consumed large quantities of 
alcohol. 

KOQla staffers have tradition-
ally prided themselves in showing 
up completely wasted. Conse-

quently, they lose by a laraer mar-
gin than they would have playinl 
sober. This particular year, how-
ever, the roles were reversed. Our 
squad boasted more players under 
the innuence than Schmidt and 
company. 

The actual game finally started 
around I :SO, as I trotted out to left 
field . After two innings. things 
looked pretty good, as we led 7-S. 
I hit a home run. drove in two with 
a triple, etc. 

But this only tumed out to be a 
tease on the part of the KOQla, as 
they obviously felt sorry for us. 
Two more innings produced a re-
versal of fortune for our squad, as 
the opponent put up \0 runs com-
pared to our two.

22 SPORTS 

POLO: Head Coach 
Denny Harper will lose the 
services of four seniors 
Continued from pee- 24 
lheir time aI UCSD. 

"The lasl 30 seconds of the title game, 
when we were up and knew we were going 
10 win - that had to be the best momenl of 
my four ycars here," All-American Jennifer 
Payne said. 'There's no feeling like it." 

Seniors feel that UCSD's 1994 champi-
onship season wa.~ made possible by Head 
Coach Denny Harper. 

"I have only respect for him," Lighlfoot 
said. "Hedocsn 'Idemand [respect] like other 
coaches, butju t watching him and listening 
to him talk about the game, iI's hard not 10." 

In a sport which emphasizes teamwork, 
thl! members of this year' s graduating class 
cadI contributed their individual abililies. 

"I Harper] focused on individual talents and 
hrooghtlhe learn together," Reiss-Holt said. 

This group of seniors has left its mark on 
UCSD waler polo and created a legacy for 
fulure teams to follow. 

"I only wish welJ for the team next year 
and the years to come," Lightfoot said. 
'There's nothing negative I could ayabout 
my four years here." 

The UCSD Guardian 

FORE: Seniors Hunt 
Cairns and Pete Roberts 
will be lost to graduation 
Continued from pee- 24 
In the '95 championships, Roberts experi-
enced pain every time he swung a club, but 
still played each round. 

". can't say enough about [Roberts]," 
Triton Head Coach Mike Wydra said. "Ev-
ery shot he was in pain. He is the epitome of 
a team player." 

After wrist surgcry to repair the torn 
cartilage in his left wrist, Roberts looked to 
help UCSD for a title run in 1996. Unfortu-
nately, he and his teammates came up short. 

"( felt that we had as good a chance as 
anybody to win it all," Roberts said. "I wish 
that we had played with [eventual champs] 
Methodist on the last day. II was the first 
time that we didn', play with them, and so 
they played without any pressure. I guaran-
lee Ihat if they were playing in our group, 
Ihey could not have shot the score that they 
did." 

Cairns, on the other hand, took a differ-
enltrack to Triton golf succe . After com-
peting for UCSD during his freshman year, 
Cairns took a two-year hiatus offfrom com-
petition. Missing the sport he loved, Cairns 

resumed his Triton golf career 
in 1996 

"[Cairns] was a highly touted 
freshman when he came in," 
Wydra said . "He spent his 
middle years finding himself. 
But this year he realized that he 
could play some great golf, and 
did that for us. He played unbe-
lievable in the championship for 
US." 

The Tritons are a cohesi ve 
unit and a renection of their 
coach. For example, the entire 
team traveled to Las Vegas for 
Assistant Coach Matt Stollem's 
wedding after their dual match 
with the San Diego Golf Acad-
emy on April 19. 

" I think the way the team is 
set up, with [Wydra's] person-
ality and him being prelly young, 
we're naturally a close group," 
Roberts said. " We hang out af-
ter matches and ii's a great envi-
ronment to play golf." 

Wydra and Ihe rest of the 
squad will definitely miss the 
great play, friendship and lead-
ership ' of both Roberts and 
Cairns.

The Apocalypse 
Is Upon Us 

Woe is me. 
I knew that the end was 

near, and on Saturday, June I , 
it arrived. On that lazy, spring 
day, one of the most cher-

I . ished and seemingly unbreak-
able streaks in sports history 
came to an end. 

The annual Koala -
Guardian softball game 
ended in tragedy. Final score: 
the Koala, 30-something and 
the Guardian , 10- omething. 

Never have I been so 
humiliated and embarrassed. 
And to make matters wor e, I 
have to own up to thi s mes 
and write this stupid column. 
But as 1 go down in flames , I 
will not hesitate to take others 
along with me. As they say, 

, 
mi ery loves company . 

The outcome of the conte t 
was looming large when I 
showed up at the Marshall 
fields at I p.m. Expecting to 
find my fellow Guardian 
people warming up, I gasped 
at the sight of 20-odd sober 
Koala t"epresentatives taking 
batting practice. Could I be 
on the wrong fie ld? If I wa 
only that lucky . 

The Koala , a staff com-
prised of about three people, 
had a simple plan. Bring 
along 10 powerful softball 

, 

players to dethrone the 
mighty Guardian. Accompa-
nied by the ringers, Tom 
Schmidt and his gang were 
ready for action. 

It was now I: 15, and my 
teammates were still nowhere 
in sight as I paced back and 
forth, hoping for a miracle. 
Everybody knew about it. I 
had ~rsonally made sure that 
each person knew where and 
when the contest would be 
played. They couldn't 
possibly flake out and 
jeopardize our winning 
streak, could they? 

Finally, out of the shadows 
of tall trees came a group of 
people. I was surely saved. 
Dan Kraft, Ivan Delventhal, 
Gregg Wrenn and Derek Van 
Hoften were coming to the 
rescue, right? They were here 
to flex some muscle and run 
up the score for our side, 
right? 

Wrong. 
It turned out to be a couple 

of our photographers and an 
old Guardian staffer. Their 
beer-pounding prowess is 
well-known, but when it 
comes down to turning a 
double play ... 

At this point, I thought of 
forfeiting. We did not have 
enough players to field a 
decent team, so there was no 
other choice. I did not waJlt to 
give the Koala the satisfac-
tion of defeating us on the 
field . It seemed like a good 
plan: forfeit and save face. 

\ But once again, fate reared its 
ugly head and the nightmare 
continued.

CORRINE 
UQHTFOOT: 
Lightfoot was the 
first person off 
the bench for 
UCSD. The team 
maintained focus 
when she came 
into the match. 
Considered the 
spark plug for the Tritons, the trustworthy 
super-sub kept the starters fresh . 

SHANNON 
WATMAN: As co-
captain of the 
squad, she 
provided great 
leadership. The 
defensive 
specialist was 
known for her 
quick bursts of 
speed, which often led to steals. Known 
to teammates as "Defensive Squirrel. " 

AMBER 
REISS-HOLT: 
The co-captain 
was crucial on 
6-5 power-play 
opportunities . 
A starter in the 
last three 
years of her 
career, Reiss-
Holt was counted upon for great 
passing and big-time scoring. 

Champion Polo Players Un~"'e to Repeat Glory of '94 
By CtIrts Lee 
Staff Writer 

Afterwinning more national cham-
pionships in the early '90s than most 
schoolseverwill, the UCSDwomen's 
water polo players were poised to 
carry on that winning tradition and 
increasetheiraIreadyimpressivecount 
of five titles. 

But since scholarships were first 
allowed in Division I water polo two 
years ago, the Tritons have been un-
able to keep up with the competition. 
The higher level of play throughout 
the country has prevented UCSD from 

continuing its dynasty. 
Despite finishing a disappointing 

seveRth at nationals, one 
could safely say this team 
was no different than the 
championship team of '94 
when it came to heart and 
intensity. 

"There was just a lot of 
team spirit, even outside of 
the pool," super-SUbstitute 
Corrine Lightfoot said. 
"One thing that I was im-
pressed with in my four years here 
was the friendliness of the team and 

the closeness between all the play-
ers." 

Defensive specialist Sh-
annon Watman also saw the 
season in a positive light, 
despite thedisappointing fin-
ish. 

"This season was worth-
while, and it was fun to corne 
out and play," Watman said. 
"Although we didn'tend the 
season where we wanted to 
be, it was still a great tirne 

and a great four years here." 
The team's positive attitude can be 

attributed to this year's senior class 
-the experienced warriors who have 
been through it all. A key to Triton 
polo success has been the attitude of 
the players. 

"All the seniors pretty much 
stepped up and became leaders," 
power-play extraordinaire Am~r 
Reiss-Holt said. "It didn't just happen 
this year, but it gradually occurred 
over the last couple of years." 

While stressing the importance of 
the 1996 season, the seniors viewed 
the title run of '94 as the highlight of

The Nineteenth Hole 
IIINT CAIRNS: A 
highly touted 
freshman coming 
into the 1992 
season, Cairns 
did not play again 
until this past 
year. He made the 
most of his time, 
however, shooting 
an even-par 72 on the last day of playoffs to 
set'..unt third place for the Tritons. 

... ao.lRTS: 
Hampered by a 
nagging wrist 
Injury, the co-
captain played 
through the pain 
and led the 
Tritons as the 
number-one 
player to a third -
place finish at the 1996 NCAA Division III 
Championships at Saratop Springs, N.Y. 

Senior Stalwarts Leave 8ig Divot 
By Sean Rahlml 
Associate Sports Editor 

Fun. It's a word you hear 
frequently when you talk to 
UCSD's golf coach, Mike 
Wydra, or any of his 
players. The Triton 
golf team has al-
ways been a c1ose-
knit group of guys 
who know how to 
have a good time, 
but take pride in 
winning. 

For Hunt Cairns 
and Ptte Roberts, 
the UCSD golf team 
will always bring back great . 
memories. 

Roberts and Cairns, the 

two seniors leaving the team 
this season, helped the Tri-
tons to a third-place finish at 
the 1996 Division III Na-
tional Championships . 

UCSD has now com-
peted in 18 straight 
championships, and 
finished among the 
top four teams in 
each of the last four 
years. 

However, Cairns 
and Roberts reached 
the end of the road 
by following differ-
ent paths. 

Roberts, the co-captain of 
this year's squad and the 
number-one seed, has played 

.. 

at UCSDsince 1993. He was 
a proud member of the 1993 
championship team, which 
won it all at Torrey Pines 
Golf Course with a team score 
of 1190. Roberts' four-day 
total score of300 tied him for 
fifth overall and earned him 
All-American honors . 

"We had a good team this 
year," Roberts said. "But I 
think that the [1993] team 
was just a notch ahead. That 
year was one of the high-
lights of my career." 

Roberts, who red-shirted 
in 1994 and than came back 
strongly in 1995, but was 
hampered by a wrist injury.
