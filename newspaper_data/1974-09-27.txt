Housing, Part I: Revelle Deer Park Clinic Ordered 
Closed; New Location Sought 

ucsO's Deer Park heroin treatment facility near Escondido has 
been ordered closed ~ the County Board of Supervisors. 

Bayer Is New Resident Dean 
By a vote of...3 to 0, the Board deemed the facility remote, 

inadequate, and roo costly. At the same time, the Board approved 
funds for a search for a new location for the residential facility . 
Officials at Deer Park s~'Wations there have been scaled down in 
anticipation of the tra 

The Supervi sors wan ~ n w c linic closer to jobs, schools, work 
training, and counseling. T~ ~er Park clinic IS situated on a former 
Peace Corp training area noM of Escondido. In addition, the Board 
voted to continue the UCSO-r~ m~thadone program , with a budget 
of 5995 ,000. The program is the ounty's major drug treatment 
program . 

County Health Care administrato Fra~k Panarisi said that although 
methadone treatment is now lh major weapon against heroin 
addiction, the County is considering u 01 acupuncture. An advisory 
panel has been formed to consider pos ible proposals to be sent to 
he Supervisors . 

upervisors said they were disturbed by the SS,460-per-patient-per-
ear cost of maintaining Deer Park . Supervisor iim Bear said, ''I'm not 
atlsfied that we're getting our money's worth even to operate Deer 

Park another two months." Panarisi had told the Supervisors it would 
ake three to six months to find a new location, and has asked that 
eer Park be allowed to operate in the interim .

Rick Bayer, who was the 

Assistant Resident Dean at 
Revelle for two years, is now the 
Resident Dean, replacing Mary 
Pates . Bayer's former position has 
been filled by Mary Cox. 

Ms. Cox received her B.A. from 
San Diego State University in 
Social Science in 1968. She also' 
holds an M .A. from Mont Clair 
State in New Jersey. She is 
currently a second year part-time 
law student at the University of 
San Diego. She hopes someday to 
become a Congresswoman from 
San Diego . Ms. Cox also has a 
strong interest in juvenile law. 

Ms. Cox, along with Mr. Bayer, 
participated in training the 
thirteen Residence Hall advisors 
at Revelle before the dorms 

opened . Eleven of the R.A.'s are 
Revelle juniors and seniors, and 
two Muir upper classmen eve 
R.A.'s for the 150 Fourth College 
students who are being housed at 
Revelle this year. 

Next year, all Fourth College 
resident students will be housed 
on Mathews Campus because the 
Third College dorms are 
scheduled to open in time for Fall 
Quarter 75. 

At this time, there are no room 
openings for male students at 
Revelle and there are 12 openings 
for female students . Contracts 
have been sent out to females in 
order of the waiting list.

are divided into 60 percent fresh-

Prelaw Seminar Scheduled For Next Week 
by Mark Woebler 

Prelaw doe n't seem to be an area of vital concern at UCSD, more 
noted for turning out biologists and doctors than lawyers. Yet, ac-
cording to Dave Blender, coordi nator for Law Week, October 1 
through 3, prelaw majors come from every field . Blender states that 
students from math and science backgrounds do particularly well , 
according to tatl tiC S 

Th purpo e of Law Week, says Blender, is to provide a perspective 
tor prelaw students Interested in the developing frontiers of law, to 
demon trate Internal support among existing prelaw students and to 
generate further awareness among those so far only considering a 
car r In law Accordingly, legal experts from a variety of disciplines 
wdl b conducting emlnars dUring the three-day event . 

On Tuesday, a emlnar will be lead by Burt Lazerow, Associate 
Dean and Professor of Law at U D . On October 2, Judge Earl Gilliam 
and Attorney Norbert Ehrenfreund will be participating. Mr. 
Ehrenfreund is a member of Defenders Inc ., a movement designed to 

provide legal assistance to the needy. On Thursday, October 3, 
defense attorney Elliot Moses and criminal attorney Steven Schwartz 
will discuss the contrasting intentions of their specialties. 

Blender believes the seminars will appeal to a wide group of 
students; those whose principle aim is the legal profession and those 
who have an interest in the law in general. Anyone interested in 
knowing where the energy of law is going to focus in the next few 
years is invited to attend. The effect of the law becomes increasingly 
important to citizens of all occupations . Law, complex as it is, draws 
on expertise from every field, including business, economics, and 
history . Says Blender, " Any well-trained mind, especially in math and 
the sciences, can do well . That's not just my opinion ," he adds, "i t's 
documented." 

In addition to the seminars, representatives from various law 
schools around the country will be conducting information sessions 
periodically on the ~CSD campus . Watch the announcements for 
information . 

The Law Week seminars will be held in Muir 2A, Room 2113, 
starting each evening at 7:30.

Styron, Cranston Speak to TT Reporters 

Socialist Styron 
. 

by James G. Soto 
Dan Styron, Socialist Workers 

Party Candidate for U.S. Senate, 
outlined his plans Wednesday to 
the Triton Times on subjects 
ranging from nationalization of 
American Corporations to ending 
U.S. Involvement in Foreign 
Affairs. 

Styron spoke at Revelle Plaza 
at noon and then later that 
evening gave a talk in the Revelle 
Informal Lounge. The Socialist 
Workers Party is a Marxist 
organization which, In the words 
of Dan Styron, " is trying to 
recapture the spirit of the Second 
Communist International. " 
Others have described the SWP as 
being Trotskyite. 

Though the SWP is not on the 
ballot, they have become the 
fourth largest political party, in 
terms of votes received in the 
1972 presidential election . 

Styron described the main issue 
in this political campaign as 
being the economy. In fact, 
nearly everythinl that Styron 
discussed eveatuaIly &ot back to 
the economy • .,.In, pointed out 
that the ecaeomy was In

that socially·it will be worse than 
the 30's because society has 
chanKed so much. He went on to 
NY thllt there will be more crime, 
racial tension, and leneral 
hostility towards the cor-

Democrat Cranston 
by John H. Taylor 

Senator Alan Cranston (0-
Calif .) said Monday that he 
opposed the President's pardon of 
Richard Nixon for any crimes he 
may have committed in the 
course of his presid ·ncy. 

Speaking in a confer nce call 
with reporter from student 
papers at seven of the nine UC 
campuses, the enator said, " I 
feel it was an abu e of the par-
doning power. I don 't think the 
President under tand the 
meaning of Watergat ." 

Cranston also expressed doubt 
about democratic presidential 
chances in 1976 in view of 
Senator Edward Kennedy's refusal 
to run . "There is no frontrunner 
now, although someone that no 
one has thought about for the 
Presidency may emerge." He 
added, " He shouldn't be just a 
charismatic leader ." 

Although refusing to discuss his 
major opponent in his re-election 
bid, Republican H.L. Richardson, 
Cranston said that the major 
points in his campaign relate to 
the · econonw, "i ntegrity in 
lovernment," and veterans' 

affairs. 
Cranston said that he would 

probably vote in favor of Nelson 
Rockefeller for vice-president, 
but that he would wait for reports 
from Congressional confirmation 
hearings. When asked about 
Rockefeller'S 'vested interests,' 
th nator said, " I don 't think we 
can hold against him the fact that 
he was born into a rich family." 

Cranston , when asked by the 
Triton Tim for his view on the 
rord admlni tratlon' warning to 
oil producing nations on Monday, 
commented that "all that money 
going into the Middle East" 
on titute a " v ry difficult 

problem " He added that he was 
relieved by Ford's clarification 
that military pressure would not 
be exerted In the Middle East . 

The Senator also expres ect 
concern over the lack of 
superviSion of various govern-
mental intelligence gath~rlng 
organizatiQns " Th re' ub-
committee of .the Arm rvl es 
Committee that's suppo ed to 
oversee the FBI and the CIA and 
uch that subcommittet> has met twic~ in five years ." 

men and 40 percent upper 
c\assmen. This ratio has been 
kept constant by the ad -
ministration from year to year. 
However, the percentages of 
under to upper classmen are 
radically different for Revelle and 
Fourth Colleges when computed 
separately. Revelle is 52 percent 
Freshmen and 48 percent upper 
classmen while Fourth is 80 
percent Freshmen and 20 percent 
upper classmen . 

According to Bayer, there are 
from 500-{'OO UCSD students 
living at the nearby La Jolla 
Village Apartments. Because of 
the large number of students, 
Harvey Dan iels, a former Muir 
College housing assistant, is living 
there as Resident Dean for those 
students. In return he is receiving 
a rent-free apartment. It is hoped 
that his arrangement will con-
tinue in the future . 

Bayer says that there will be 
more closed events this year on 
the Revelle campus, due to the 
large number of high school 
students from La Jolla who at-
tended events last year. 

The h igh school students 
presented legal problems, such as 
posseSSion of alcohol on campus 
and from Un ivers ity property 
damage. Both Bayer and the 
University police are considering 
a new policy whereby citations 
will be wr itten for minors who 
have possession of alcohol on 
campus . They hope thiS policy 
will help deter drunkenness by 
high school students and others 
on campus. But Bayer stresses 
that this does not mean that 
campus pol ice will go through the 
dorms searching for those In 
.possession of illegal alcohol.

Blows 
andCb eap 

by Edwilrd Simoni Shots 
UCSD Continuum 

It's not something I admit very often', but I too was a freshman 
once. As such, I was prey to the same fears and anxieties you are 
suffering through now. Even as you read this, you have probably 
kindled a smouldering hate in the breast of your Humanities TA. By 
now you've probably ceased wondering what you are doing here and 
started wondering what your roommate is doing here. 

Keep reading. There's hope. 
When I was a freshman I was alone. Of course, there was my 

roommate, but that was like being alone - squared . To be frank , I 
could've used a ~ew helpful hints in my first days here. I didn't know 
everything and still don't, but then , I haven't graduated yet either. 
Still, I bel ieve I can help make your time in stir a bit easier. 

Let's get down to basics. Sex, right? We can all relate to that. Now, 
do you remember those pictorial (and pectoral) features in Playboy 
about " Sex on Our Campuses"? Maybe you remember some of those 
"Campus Morality" stories in Christian Cuideposts Magazine. Two 
more dissimilar publications don't exist though their impressions of 
sex on campus are much the same. 

Inflation , you know - affects everything. 
Th is isn 't exactly Oral Roberts U. but keep your eyes open and 

d"n't blink too often . It might be a good idea to brush up on your 
meaningfulness, should you have any.(Your being here suggests to 
the contrary .) People here don't eat together without a meaningful 

_ relationship. 
Okay, academics. If you went to summer orientation , you probably 

heard Paul Saltman tell you you were one in ten . It's quite true. Less 
than ten percent of college students attend summer orientations . 
They have a special name in the Provost's office for you . Saps. Vou 
are worth your weight in advertising gold for the tales of greatness 
you passed on to your parents . Not only were you free, but you paid 
for the honor. 

It's best to take everything Paul says with a grain of you-know-
what. Were you told that the faculty included Harold Urey, Stanley 
Miller, and a cast of Nobel Prize winners? Sure, they're here. But the 
guy who gives the grades and interprets the emanations from your 
professor is your TA, Harvey Stupidsky. This is not to demean TA's . 
Simply stated, I can 't. T A's are nonetheless interesting from the 
viewpoint of evolution . Notice the crosshairs in the eyes, the sweaty 
temples, the quivering upper lip when you disagree. 

Alright , let's touch upon social life. If you're living in a campus 
residence hall , there are but two things to remember. First, drinking 
alcohol , taking drugs, and illicit sex (whatever that is) are forbidden . 
Second , don't get caught . Also, bear in mind that no one should buy 
balloons at Mayfair for 39 cents per twenty and fill them with water. 
Nor, having not done thiS, should anyone throw them and have fun . 
The best time not to throw them is Halloween. A lot of fun hasn't 
been had on past Halloweens. 

It's best not to have too much fun on cam pus . You have to 
remember, you're mature now. 

I lived on cam pus a couple of years before I felt the need for a 
change of venue. Now I live in Del Mar, wh ich is Spanish for "of the 
mar ." You can always te ll a student from Del Mar. For the women, 
bulky, hooded, rayon jackets are de rigeur . They come in two colors, 
gray and gray·green . For the men, baggy pants are all the rage. 

The Del Mar look is most exemplified by the book bag. When 
carried on both shoulders. it bespeaks a driving, aggressive character . 
A one-shouldered bag means the person carrying it is cool . Now you 
can tell. 

Del Mar has a reputation for being quiet and unhurried. Much of 
this is due to the gentle lapping of the blue Pacific on the crystal 
white beaches but may be due more to the rigidly enforced speed 

. limits and lack of nightspots . 
One further thing, meine herren . The only way to get the complete 

dope on everything happening in the Western Hemisphere is to read 
the Triton Times. Only the Triton Times gives you the unvarnished 
truth on every facet of human existence on planet Earth . The Triton 
Time ' alone knows all. The Triton Times ... the Triton Times .... 

At • he coun t of th ree, you wi II all awaken .

Styron for Senate 
Continued from POI. 1 

One of the primary economic 
problems is inflation . Styron said 
the platform of the SWP included 
adding a cost of living clause to 
labor contracts. Styron added, 
however, that this would be a 
problem because 80 percent of 
people working for wages do not 
belong to a union or similar 
organization . In addition, the 
SWP will be pushing for more 
benefits for Vietnam war 
veterans, welfare, social security 
recipients, and for members of 
oppressed minorities. 

"America's foreign policy is the 
most inflationary aspect of the 
economy," said Styron, in 
outlining his views on foreign 
policy . Styron believes that 
America's "defense of the status 
quo" abroad is the prime reason 
for this inflationary aspect . 
Claiming that defense of the 
status quo involves defense of 
Amertcan corporations abroad, 
Styron pointed to Rockefeller ; as 
a prime example of the mesh 
between American government 
and American business. 

Styron said that if he were i.n 
the Senate he would vote against 
all military appropriations and all 
support for regimes such as those 
in South Africa.

Runaround 'Has Cost 1Y2 Years 
This university has become less like a university in the c lassic sense 

and more like a high powered trade school. designed to crank out the 
maximum number of highly trained people in the minimum amount 
of time. The concern is to produce technicians for the Creat Social 
Machine, rather than to provide an E'nvironmnet conducive to 
maximum development of one's potential as a human being. 

We have the vast bureaucratic web of the administration hiding 
behind organization charts and triplicate forms . Our "student 
government" is little more than a plethora of ineffectual committees. 
perhaps offering a real opportun ity for " involvement·" almost 
anybody who shows the slightest intere t can obtain a committee 
appointment, whether they are qualified or not. 

We have a growi ng campus; new buildings are springing up like 
weeds, with the architectural style ranging from thp Mausoleum 
Modern of the Mandeville Center to the flimsy construction of the 
Triton Tinderbox. The food services continue to feed the students 
exhibrting a mixture of arrogance. gall and poor taste. Cut·throat 
competition in classes drives student to the terile recesses of the 
libraries, to the superficial pleasantries of an overcrowded beach, to 
an artificial wonderland of drugs, or to M esa College for "usefu l 
education". 

And the soc ial life? There must be a committee or two workmg on 
it 

These problems and their solutions are intricate and complex . It 
may well be beyond the power of anyone individual or any one 
group to make significant changes in this universi ty We must 
become aware of the problems, become aware that there are 
alternatives to the current situation . become aware that we need not 
bli ndly accept what is forced upon us. 

It is not an impossible dream to hope that this will become a 
humane un iversity. To do this we must first become aware of what we 
are . Only then can we decide what we should be.

Dear Editor, 
On September 20, 1973 E. Joe Lawerence 

arrived in San Diego, found an apartment and 
moved in, anticipating the commencement of 
the Fall quarter at UCSD. 

On September 21 , 1973 Joe walked across the 
Muir campus to Matthews to begin the ardous 
task of registration . "We're very sorry Mr. 
Lawerence but our records show no evidence 
of your application , on ly transcripts from your 
high school and junior college." 

Joe had neglected to save his letter of ac-
ceptance. 

"Mr. Laweren ce why don't you reapply for the 
Winter quarter and we'lI see if we can't start you 
out albeit a quarter late?" 

December, 1973 . a phone call , "Mr. 
Lawerence this is the admissions office at UCSD 
It has come to our attention that because some 
of your credi ts at Palo Verde Community College 
are non-transferable you are nine units short and 
we can't let you register for the Winter quarter." 

"We're sorry Mr. Lawerence but it's just out of 
our hands Policy you know." "Yes we know you 
have all your C. E. requirements but there is just 
nothing this office can do. Why not try our 
extension program? You can take any class you 
like but there will be no credit on your tran-
script . We ca n, however. u e those classes, 
provided you pass them to make up the needed 
nme units." 

The winter quarter begins with E. Joe 
Lawerence enrolled in non-credit extension 
courses. He completes them and goes to see the 
provost at Muir College. 

"Hello loe. Sit down, sit down. How are you? 
Yes, I've been reviewing your schedule and the 
classes you need. Boy. that sure was too bad you 
cou ldn't get In last Fall You know if I were you 
I'd Illst drop out fo r the Spring quarter because 
most of the courses you need to really get 
tarted on your major aren 't offered until . next 

Fall ." 

" It's just not practible Joe, you'd be wast ing 
your time and money. I recommend you wait ." 

Joe waited . 
September. 1974. Joe had to reapply fo r 

admission . He receives two notices of ac-
ceptance. Then a phone cal l. " Yes Mr. 
Lawerence this is the registrar's office at UCSD. 
There seems to be some kind of a mix-up here 
regarding your admission t his Fall. It seems your 
grades for last winter were all D·s." 

The EO~ off ice called the professors Joe had 
during the winter. Immediately available were 
Dr. Soto. instructor for Endocrinology and Dr. 
Livingston, instructor for Neurobiology. Both 
con firmed B grade~ . Unavailable was Dr. 
Silverson who taught Physiology. 

"We do have verbal statements on at least two 
grades as being B's. Mr Lawerence, but what 
with computer errors and red tape It will be six 
months before we can get It straightened out. 
Why not apply for the Winter quarter - we can't 
make any guarantees, but perhapsl Better yet, 
why not try a lunior college?" 

E. Joe Lawerence IS 26 years old, an ex-Navy 
corpsman . 

He had, at Palo Verde College. a C.P.A. of 3.4 
and the resp~ct . admiration , and recom· 
mendatlon of every instructor he ever met He 
was awarded the most valuable student com-
mendation at this same school and elected its 
student body vice-president his second year 
there. 

He is a licensed practi cal nurse. 
He has a permanent teaching credent ial for 

the IIlstruction of nurse's aides at hospitals 
He is not inept, stupid, or unpersonable. 
He is aspiring to be a doctor and has a suitcase 

full of recommendations from many people in 
that profeSSion with whom he has worked . 

He has only junior standing in college and 
because of the turn-arounds he has been given at 
UCSD he has lost a minimum of one and half 
years of school time . When you're 26 and still 
cl imbing, that time can be a telllllg blow. 

This letter is probably as hopeless as Joe's case 
but it had to be written . School has been in 
session for just one week . Is there any way at all 
this man can be allowed to matriculate and 
pursue his education now. before all desire for It 
has been postponed out of him?

Petrodollars: Arab 
Ivestments in U.S. 

BY LAWRENCE MOSHER 
The N.tion.1 Observer 

Adnan M . Khashoggi, a wealthy Saudi Arabian, believes in the 
future of Walnut Creek, Calif . Earlier this year he bought two banks 
there worth $SO million, S1 million of acreage, and a fast-food 
franchise featuring steaks. 

The Kuwaitis are high on America too. In recent months Kuwaiti 
investors, both government and private, acquired an island off South 
Carolina, half ownership of a new S100 million Hilton hotel, shopping 
mall, and office complex in Atlanta, an Idaho cattle feed-lot business 
and a m~ltimi!lion-doliar apart":Jent project in Louisville, Ky. They 
are also fmancmg a new S60 million resort facility at Kentucky's Lake 

Bar~l~y, a deal arranged by former Vice President Spiro Agnew, In 
addition, there are reports the Kuwaitis are knee-deep in 20000 acres 
of Oklahoma soybean crop land. - ' 

Not to be outdone by the Arabs, the Shah of Iran purchased a 
Manhattan building on swank Fifth Avenue, tore it down, and is 
putt.lng up a 34-story skyscraper for offices and apartments; the 

Iran~an govern~ent will use a quarter of the building . Another 
Iranian group likes the Ozarks and reportedly has bought a sizable 
chunk of land near Springdale, Ark. 

The Iranian National Oil Co. recently canceled plans to buy 50 per 
cent of Ashland Oil Co.'s refining and marketing operations because 
the Kentucky based American oi l company is too small for the 
Iran ians' long-range plans. Antitrust regulations would have 
prevented the Iranians from buying more U.S. oil business later so 
the Iranian government-owned company now is looking for a bigger 
American deal. 

What's going on? Some of those extra dollars we all paid for higher 
home fuel bills last Winter, and are continuing to pay for gasoline, 
electriCity, and other higher prices that relate to the soaring cost of 
foreign oi l, are beginning to com'e back . The money men have a 
name for them--petrodollars. 

The World Bank estimates that by 1985 the non-Communist world's 
oil-exporting countries will have accumulated $1 2 trillion, whi h is 
roughly equal to Am ri ca's gross national product - the nation's total 
output of goods and services-for 1973. Most of this wealth wi II be 
owned by countri s like Saudi Arabia, Libya, Kuwait , Abu Dhabi , and 
Iran, ountries that won't be able to spend even a third of their 
swollen oil revenue for national needs. This mean that billion of 
petrodollars will be available for Investment-som where The Unitf'd 
States looms as a major petrodollar Investment market.

Randy Miller, the pitching ace 
of last year's UCSD baseball team, 
is presently pitching in the 
Baltimore Orioles minor league 
farm system . 

Miller is now in Florida pit-
ching in the winter instructional 
leagues, after co mpletin g a 
season with the Lodi Orioles of 
the California League. 

With Ladi thi s past summer, 
Miller compiled a 3-{) won-lost 
and a very respectable 3.54 
earned run average. Lodi finished 
the season in second place. 

Miller bypassed his senior year 
of eligibility at UCSD in order to 
sign with the Orioles. Baltimore 
drafted Miller in the fifth round of 
the Major League Draft last 
spring. 

While attending UCSD, Miller 
compiled an overall earned run 

Triton 
Turns 
Oriole 

Steve Gould and lCirlc Robinson 

average of just under 2.00 for 
three years and tallied 8 wins 
against just three loses in his 
junior year. Head Triton coach 
Lyle O lsen strong ly urged Randy 
to sign the cont ract offered to 
him,knowing that the fireballing 
young man would complete his 
edu atlOn during the off season. 
Olo;on added that Miller, who had 
set a personal goal of 14 wins in 
hiS Junior y ar, ould have easily 
altai n d his goal if he had had a 
stronger defensive team playing 
behind him. HIS three loses came 
by 1-0 or 2-1 setbacks. 

"Miller has better stuff and 
better velocity than Jim Barr (one 
of the players Olsen has coached 
and now in the starting pitching 
rotation of the San FranCISco 
Giants .)" and " he has got the 
tools of making a big league 

player," noted Olsen. Among 
01 sen's noteable "students" are 
Dave Roberts of the Padres, Bob 
Gallagher of the Astros, Bill Lee 
of the Red Sox, Dave Kingman of 
the Giants and according to 
Olsen, Miller ranks as good as 
many of these big league stars. 

Olsen stated that one big factor 
in Miller's advancement in ability 
and pro ball status was the 
process of creative visualization, 
conceived by LCSD Staff member 
Bob Moss. Moss mentioned that 
"Randy was an intense young 
man who had specific dreams to 
accomplish," one of which was to 
sign a pro con tract. " By utilizing 
his sources of energy, Randy 
fi nally realized setting his goals 
could be accomplished by 
projecting himself mentally into 
the future." 

Water Polo 
Opens Season 

A young, aggressive Triton 
water palo conti ngent will give 
Gary becker his initiation as 
coach when it encounters 
Pomona College this Friday at 
&:00 p.m. in the UCSD pool. 

Coach Becker feels the team is 
capab le of improving upon its 12-
10 record of last year with 12 
members of last year's squad 
returning The team is also very 
young; consisting of 22 freshman 
and sophomores out of a squad of 
25. 

they are a well balanced, scrappy 
group that demonstrates a lot of 
team comraderie in the pool. 

The team is also very en-
tertaining and colorful and one 
worthy of student support. 
Leading the returnees is the lone 
senior Mark liska, affectionately 
named The Mouth by his 
teammates. 

I Frisbees Fly Tomorrowl UCSD pitching coach Larry Wi llins also aided Miller, but Randy's natural ability meant, as Coach Olson concluded, that 
baSically, it was " Randy Miller 
taking care of Randy Miller." 

Becker feels the Tritons will be 
a definite power to reckon with In 
the future, but he does not 
discount the possibility of them 
claimi ng the small college 
championship this year . The 
Tritons boast no superstars, but 

Coach Gary Becker's coachi ng 
philosophy could be said to be as 
low-keyed as UCSO's athletic 
program. He IS not out to build a 
dynasty because he does not have 
the financial backing to do 50, as 
many large school water polo 
teams do (e.g. S.D. State), and 
nobody really wants to have one 
around here anyway because It 
might destroy our famous UCSD 
atmosphere of school apathy . 

All right , all Frisbee flipping 
freaks who think that they are hot 
stuff, here's your chance to show 
what special attributes you 
possess . On Saturday Sept. 28 on 
the Muir PlaYing Field, the 1974 
Open Frisbee Tournament will 
take place. 

The day's festivities begin at 
10:30 when US Frisbee Champion 
Tom Boda will give free in-
struction and demonstrations 
The actua l contests will begin at 
"00 p.m. There is no charge for 
entering the contest, and prizes 
will be awarded to the winners. 

The tournament itself is 
comprised of six events The first 
IS entitled Torpedo Alley; the 
object ive being to propel the 
frisbee through nine pairs of 
pylons while still airborne . 

The econd event is ca lled 
Boomera ng, or the most popular 
way to play frisbee when one is 
alone . The objective of this event 
IS to have the fri sbee go at least 
25 feet from the point of ori gi n 
and lanci as close to that point as 
possible. 

For people who specialize in 
skipping stones across a river, the 
Skipping event should prove to be 
a strong poi nt, with points being 
awarded for the most distance 
between the first two skips of the 
frisbe . 

Then for the people who just 
like to vent some of their 
frustrations, the Far Out com-
petition is for ~u . The objective 

here being to simply heave the 
frisbee as far as possible 

Since this contest has an event 
for everybody, people with 
aerobatic inclinations will ap-
preciate Mississippi Bank where 
the frisbee must clear a corner 
and land as close to the target as 
possible. 

Finally, for those who are 
tenacious and accurate, the Hula 
Hooper is just what one needs to 
practice precisi on and to have 
some fun at the same time. The 
ult imate goal being to throw the 
frisbee through a hoop and have 
it land as close to the center of 
the target as possible.

tertainment and art in the San Diego area, on and off the 
UCSD campus .

reviews , and review reviews. 

It's also (also) a spot to share original tiction, poetry, 

prose, and what-not, as well as a place to print original 
drawings, photos, and other artistic printables.

What Program Board? • IS a 
It goes without saying that "Program Boards 

don't grow on trees," and yet even many long-
time UCSD students are not completely certain 
exactly What, When , and Why is the Program 
Boardl 

The Campus Program Board (CPB) is the 
student-faculty committee responsible for the 
large majority of films, concerts, dances, lec-
tures, and special events which happen on 
campus . According to new CPB Chairman, Dr. 
John Stewart, Program Board's goal is "to 
provide very high quality programs that are both 
intellectually and artistically stimulating as well 
as entertaining for the UCSD community." 

This job falls into the hands of the committee, 
comprised of a student from each college, two 
graduate students, two "at large" students to be 
selected by the student co-op, and eight faculty 
members who represent the staff and interests in 
music, drama, and visual arts. These sixteen 
people work hand-in-hand with various con-
su ltants, seeking to supply UCSD with programs 
that combine entertainment with fresh horizons 
of tyle in the arts. 

Last year's Program Board has already left a 
legacy which is appearing this rail Quarter. 
Some up-coming events worth casual mention 

are the appearance of Electric Flag (Mike 
Bloomfield, Buddy Miles, Nick Gravenitesl on 
Oct. 6 in the gym; the appearance of Brian 
Auger on Oct. 27; folks concerts such as Kenny 
Hall , Joe Gwaltney, and the True and Trembline 
String Bank on Oct . 201 and notablv, The 
Manhattan Project's environmental theatre 
piece " Alice in Wonderland" on Oct. 12. 

The Program Board is also scheduling a 
weekly "special activity" day, every Wednesday 
at the new student center. Oct. 2 will see a 
student ·Organizatif>n activity fair with music 
and piles of information about special interest 
organizations. A do-it-yourself talent show will 
appear Oct. 9, with the space and microphones 
provided, and the entertainment lying in the 
hands of the entertaining . And in future 
Wednesdays: an honest-to-goodness swap 
meet, a concert or two, and the opportunity to 
make your own animated films . 

Their banner is CPB and they welcome in-
terested students to get involved . If you're in-
terested in getting onto the committee, talk to 
your college provost and see about getting 
nominated.

take! Tuition is low [2Sc each time you sit in ) and you don't 
have to worry about the grade. Meets regularly at U(:SD and 
Fashion Valley, as well as Sorrento Valley . You can drop in 
anytime or sign up for a S10·a·month Saverpass. Offered by 
San Diego Transit's Action Plan '74. Call 239-81£.1 for
