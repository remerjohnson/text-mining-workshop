TMC hosts alcohol awareness week 
Students educated on the dangers of alcohol and drug abuse 
By RAY HENGST 
Staff Writer 

A mangled car, a wall of stu-
dents' stories about drugs and alco-
hol , and posters telling the negative 
effects of alcohol and drug usc 
highlight T hurgood Marshall 
Coll ege'S Alcohol and Drug 
Awareness Week. 

The campaign to educate snl-
dents about drinking takes place in 
front of the Thurgood Marshall 
College dean's office from 11 a.m. 
to I p.m. every day this week. It is 
held every year before the Sun God 
festival to "give [students) the 
facts" about alcohol and other 
drugs, according to Marshall 
Coordinator of Student Activities 
Vicki Kerba Miller. 

"We're aware that students may 
choose to drink," Miller said. "We 
want to give them alternatives." 

Student Legal Services, 
Psychological and Counseling 
Services, and Triton Taxi provided 
representatives and booths in front 
of the dean's office. 

"Srudents who are wallcing by 
will casually get information," 
Miller said. "We've had a great 
turnout." 

Even the UCSD Police 
Department was on hand to speak 
to students. 

"We're just out here answering 
any questions on alcohol... just 
explaining the physical effects of 
alcohol on your system ," said offi-
cer John Smart. 

Some studen ts tried on beer 

goggles, which are designed "to 
simulate the perceptual effects of 
intoxication," said psychologist 
Jerry Phelps. 

Students ineptly attempted to 
drive a remote-controlled toy car 
through a small course with the

According to campus police, 
authorities will enforce a zero-tol-
erance policy during tt.;: annual Sun 
God festival Friday. The event is 
often characterized by an increase 
in student drinking on campus. 

Due to the history of Sun God 
and its relationship with the posses-
sion and consumption of alcohol, 
police officers say they will be look-
ing for signs of public intoxication 
on their patrols. 

Community service officers, 
residential service officers and San 
Diego Police Department deputies 
will provide additional aid. 

"From what I've heard," said 
Earl Warren College freshman 
Richard Hagar, "Sun God festival is 
an excuse to party and get ham-
mered. I'm sure there will be a lot 
of people drunk on Friday." 

Many students seem to share 
Hagar's view, and this is the prima-
ry reason campus police are on 
alert during the festivities. 

"There are usually several factors 
that we look for in situations of pub-
lic intoxication," said officer John 
Smart. "It's a combination of signs 
that include being passed out, vomit-
ing in the bushes or making a scene." 

Students detained for public 

intoxication will be transported to 
detox for detention, according to 
Smart. Depending on their coopera-
tion, students sent there will be 
under supervised care for a mini-
mum of four hours. Uncooperative 
suspects will be arrested and 
detained for a minimum of six hours. 

After being released, the indi-
vidual is allowed to call for some-
one to pick them up from detox. 

Campus police will also look for 
minors possessing alcohol. 
Students cited for being minors in 
possession and who have a valid 
campus ID will be given a citation 
and then released. The citation will 
include a court date, and the 
accused student must appear in a 
San Diego courtroom. 

Penalties usually include fines 
and community service hours, 
according to police. Those without 
a valid campus ID will be arrested 
and detained. 

"Minor in possession is consid-
ered a misdemeanor," Smart said. 
"It will go down as a misdemeanor 
on your record." 

Eleven to 13 CSOS will also be 
available Friday evening to escort 
students upon request. They will 
also roam the campus throughout 
the day to provide additional help

After 26 consecutive years at 
UCSD, the San Diego Chargers 
announced last week that this 
summer will be the final year the 
team trains on campus. 

The Chargers, who have used 
the northern half of RIMAC field 
and the adjacent Spanu~ Athletic 
Training Facility during the sum-
mer months, will move into a new 
facility on the California State 
University Dbmjnguez Hills cam-
pus in Carson, Calif., immediately 
preceding the 2003 season. 

The new facility will be part of 
a larger sports complex, which, 
when completed, will include a 
27,OOO-seat soccer stadium for the 
Los Angeles Galaxy of Major 
League Soccer, as well as a 
l3,OOO-seat tennis stadium that

will host the Pete Sampras Tennis 
Academy. 

John Butler, general manager 
of the Chargers, explained the 
reasons behind the team's move. 

"Our goal is to win a champi-
onship, and the environment at 
training camp plays a key role in 
building a winning team," Butler 
stated in a press release. "Team 
chemistry and camaraderie are 
formed during the tough days of 
camp. By taking the team away 
from familiar surroundings and 
personal distractions, it helps the 
players focus on the task at hand . 
They spend time together and 
bond as a team." 

The Chargers first came to 
UCSD in the summer of 1976 
when they trained on what is now 
Warren Field. In 1988, team 
owner Alex Spanos donated a SI .1 
million training facility to the uni-

versity to improve campus athletic 
facilities . Today, the Spanos 
Athletic Training Facility serves as 
the summer home of the Chargers 
and also several of UCSD's sport-
ing teams, coaching staffs and 

.recreation classes. 
Zelda McLeish, assistant 

director of sports facilities at 
UCSD, said the Chargers will be 
missed. 

"It's unique that we're able to 
- just on the other side of a fence 
- have recreational play right 
there on the same playi~g field as 
an NFL team. That, I think we'll 
miss." 

In exchange for donating the 
Spanos Athletic Training Facility 
to the university more than a 
decade ago, the school has 
allowed the Chargers to train on

Aquarium. 

Cronkite will be awarded a medal and $25,000 
for his service to scientific issues in series such as 
"Can the World Be Saved! and "Walter Cronkite's 
Universe." 

The Nierenberg Prize is named in honor of 
national science leader William Nierenberg, who 
served as director of Scripps from 1965 to 1986. 
Nierenberg, renowned for work in low-energy 
nuclear pnysics and underwater warfare research, 
held posts on several panels of the Presidents 
Science Advisory Committee. 

Cronkite, who was voted several times as "the 
most trusted man in television news,' joined a 
Scripps expedition in 1982 to the East Pacific Rise, 
where he journeyed two miles deep to the ocean 
floor to be the first joumalist to examine the newly 
discovered hydrothermal vents. The anchorman has 
received several awards of merit, including the 
Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1981 and the 
Governor's Award from the Academy of Television 
Arts and Sciences.

Chargers: 
NFL franchise will leave 
UCSD after 26 years 
Continued from page 1 
RlMAC field for free during the 
summer. Consequently, the finan-
cial impact on UCSD caused by the 
loss of the Chargers starring in 
2003 is expected to be minor. 

One area affected by the 
Chargers' eventual departure is 
UCSD Ilousing & Dining 
Services, which rents apartments 
from Thurgood Marshall College 
to team personnel each summer. 
Additionally, this service has pro-
vided members of the team with 
their daily meals from Oceanview 
Terrace restaurant while training 
camp is in session at UCSD. 

With the anticipated loss of the 
Chargers during the summer 
months of each year, H&DS will 
need to find new tenants to occupy 
ti,e on-campus apartments vacated 
by the team, something tI,at is nec-
essary to avoid raising student fees 
during the academic year. 

Mark Cunningham, director of 
H&DS, docs not foresee any prob-
lems. 

"We're going to miss Ithe 
Chargers]," Cunningham said. 
"We've had a great relationship ... 
but, to be honest, we will fill in 
witll other conferences and proba-
bly actually be able to make as 
much or more business during the 
summer." 

UCSD will also enjoy greater 
access to its athletic fie lds once the 
Chargers leave, McLeish said.

University must 
not keep Koala 
trial a secret 

The UCSD administration is in the process 
of trying Tile Koala for allegedly VIolating 
UCSD's Student Conduct Coae - and it is 
keeping the entire process a guarded secret. 

According to Koala Editor in Chief George 
Liddle, The Korila is being charged with 
"obstruction or disruption . of teaching, 
research, administration, disciplinary proce-
dures, or other UCSD or University activi-
ties." If fOW1d guilty, the controversial hW110r 
publication - a registered student organiza-
tion - faces potentially devastating conse-
quences: a possible one-year suspensIOn from 
activity on campus and revocation of its status 
as a student organization, 

Holding secret trials that could result in 
the elimination of a campuswide publication 
is illegal, W1democratic and at a public uni-
versity whose motto is "Let there be light," 
shamelessly hypocritical. 

AccordlOg to the Bagley-Keene Open 
Meeting Act, "It is the public policy of this 
state [California] that public agencies exist to 
aid in the conduct of me people's business and 
the proceedings of public agencies be con-
ducted openly so that the public may remain 
informed." 

Among the most important "proceedings 
of public agencies" are trials. Were these 
charges brought against an individual student 
who wished that his educational record 
remain confidential, holding the trial behind 
closed doors would be understandable, But 
this is not even remotely the case, 

The Koala is not by any means an individ-
ual; it is a campuswiae student organization 
and a memoer of the campus press. 
Additionally, all principal memoers of Tile 
Koala (the only members of the defense 
allowed to represent the organization dur-
ing the trial) formally requested that the 
proceedings be opened to the public. 
UCSD summarily and unilaterally denied 
their requests. 

The administration's actions are puzzling 
at best, especia lly because there is no justifi-
able reason for keeping the trial of a stu-
dent-funded publication secret. National 
defense is not at stake, \¥hat is at stake is 
freedom of speech, freedom of the press, 
freedom of information, the right to due 
process and the very credibility of UCSD's 
Judicial process. 

As we all know, the university is railroading 
a student organization through a kangaroo 
court. In all seriousness, are UCSD stuaents 
acnJally expected to take it on faith that The 
Koala will receive a fair trial, especially when 
the trial is governed by the same university 
that has publicly condemned the defendant 
via all-campus e-mails and in the press? 

Americans have been raised with the notion 
that one cannot place any faith in any system 
if one cannot see it. The only way there can be 
any assurance that the e proceedings will be 
conducted fairly is by opening them to the 
public. At a university with colleges named 
after Earl \Varren and Thurgood Marshall, it 
is ironic that this is even an issue. 

Denying students their right to know 
what action their own W1i ,'crsitv is taking 
against a student organization fUnded with 
student money is unacceptable, and the 
Guardiau will not stand for it.

Bring back the music: Restore 
Sun God to its fortner glory 

The A.S. Council made improvements to the 
festival in recent years, but more can be done 

By JOSEPH LEE 
Senior Staff Writer 

There is something missi ng this year. 
I am missing the excitement, the 

buzz, the hype, the rumors and that 
magic that surrounds the campus around 
mid-May. 

Perhaps [ am running with a jaded 
circle of friends. but the usual allure and 
anticipation of the Sun God festival is 
missing. The evening concert does not 
seem to be the primary focus of the Sun 
God festival anymore. For many people 
the day is an excuse to sneak kegs into 
the apartmenrs in big trash cans, evade 
the authorities 3nd generally let loose 
from the daily grind of school. But 
despite the healthy attendence at the 
evening concert, people don 't seem very 
enthusiastic to rush up to the show. 

In previous years, the Sun God festi-
val catered to such acts as Blur ( \992), 
Blues Traveler and Gin Blossoms (\993), 
They Might Be Gianrs and 0 Doubt 
(1994), The Pharcyde and 311 (1995) 
and Rocket from the Crypt and Souls of 
Mischief ( 1996). In 1997 we saw De La 
Soul, Save Ferris and Clyde'S Ride. Social 
Distortion played in 1998 and Cypress 
Hill in 1999. 

[n recent memory we have had to deal 
with Di hwalla, Rahzel from the Roots, 
The Aqllaba ts and the loca l act, F.o.N. 
That W3S in 2000. Redemption came last 
year with Naughty By ature, Face to 
Face, Xzibit and local band Ping Pong 
Mafia. 

All in all, the acts do not look too bad 
on paper: Blur was in the early stages of 
an illustrious career. Blues Traveler had 
three albums under its belt anri had 
released "Save His Soul" just a month 
before their appearance 3t Sun God. 31 1 
were entering into the best years of their 
C<lreer. And you cannot go wrong with 
Social Distortion and Cypress Hill. 

But many studcnrs sti ll have the taSte 
of Dishwalla to wash out of their mOlllhs. 
And although Sun God 200\ was fairly 
succe sful, the memory of the concert 
quickly faded away for many people. 

The blame docs not and should not 
fall entirely on the shoulders of the A.S. 

programming office. Those people are 
working day and night trying to get well-
known acrs to the campus. They run into 
bands who simply say no, bands who 
cancel at the last moment, or artists who 
were told by the court to serve the com-
munity in other ways (as in the case of 
rapper Ludacris). The limited budget 
also gets in the way - sometimes 
$80,000 is not enough to satisfy a fickJe 
campus. 

I understand how hard the A.S. pro-
grammers work and I understand the 
hurdles they have to le'l p before the 
dreams of a successful Sun God is made 
a reality. 

But perhaps in the future there can be 
a di ffercnt approach to Sun God and 
how to coordinate it all. Maybe a lot of 
these ideas won't be feasible in the near 
future, but it's definitely something to 
think about. 

First, look deeper in the pool of 
music: There needs to be more consider-
ation of different genres of music. The 
Sun God format has generally stuek with 
the alternative rock, punk rock and hip-
hop format, There seems to be little con-
sideration of up-and-coming Brit-pop 
acts. British bands have slowly made 
their way up the American pop charts 
and why not take advantage of them 
while their populari ty is strong but small 
enough to entertain a college? Fresh acts 
from a different genre may help avoid 
Sun God being associated wi~h an event 
that brings tired o ne-hi t wonder bands to 
UCSD and recapture some old glory. 

The festival needs to stay on the Clll-
ting edge of music. 

Remember, in 1992, Blur was not a 
very big band but they soon defincd the 
Brit-pop sce ne. No Doubt was just a 
year away from releasing their hit 
album, "Tragic Kingdom." Blues 
Traveler was a year away from racing up 
the charts with their album, "Four." 
Sure, we have to respect the old-school 
acts but the Sun God festival needs to 
start looking at artists who are poised to 
become stars. Maybe it's just mc, but 1 
think Dishwalb, aughty By Nature 
and The Aquabats arc on the tail end of 
their careers. 

UCSD also has to shed irs discomfort 
with electronica. 

The DJ tem at the Sun God festival is 
a step, but it's not quite enough. We 
should continue to expand the tent and 
maybe even look to a DJ as a headliner. 
Electronica has exploded all over the 
world but it has yet to make too much of 
an impact American pop culture. 

Perhaps it is time for UCSD to 
embrace a growing culture surrounding 
dance music. There are dozens of DJ s on 
the West Coast who can be easily 
brought into San Diego to spin an 
incredible set. DJ Mark Thrasher here in 
San Diego has a residency at On 
Broadway in downtown San Diego and 
spins the latest house music and Top 40 
club hi ts. Thrasher can give the under-
age students a taste of the post-21 
lifestyle. Jon Bishop is another local DJ 
who can give smdents a taste of San 
Diego c1ubbmg. 

Second, move the date of the festival : 
Why did Jack Johnsoll and The Strokes 
decide to play at UCSD within a week of 
each other? Because of Coachella Music 
and Arts Festival in Indio, Calif. Johnson 
played a set at RIMAC Arena before he 
took a weekend trip to Coachella. The 
Strokes, who were fresh off a weekend in 
Indio, decided to stop by UCSD after-
ward. 

Coachella caters to dozens of rock, 
hip -hop and electronic acts. Maybe if 
the Sun God festival was se t near late-
April we could take advantage of th e 
bands while they arc in the area . I'm 
sure it wouldn't take toO much for a 
fair ly popular act to tay in the gor-
geous San Diego c1imare for a few morc 
days to playa gig in front of an cnthu-
sia tic crowd of students. 

T hird, shorter lineup, bigger acts: We 
should pool more money into two rea lly 
good acts instead of three or morc 
mediocre acts. And remember, we Coln't 
make everyone happy so let's not be 
afraid of not including a hip-hop act one 
year or a rock act the next year. Keep the 
Battle of the Bands winner, though.

Elian: Doubts remain after more than three years 
The Cuban boy is no longer a child, but a political chess piece of Fidel Castro 
.y PAilISA BAHARIAN 
Senior Staff Writer 

As you undertake your unprece-
dented tour of Cuba, President 
Carter, there is a question I would 
like answered: What happened to 
Elian Gonzalez, the boy we deport-
ed to Cuba? 

As June 28 nears, the two-year 
anniversary of Elian 's forced return 
to Cuba, I can't help but wonder 
what really became of the Iitde boy 
who won the hearts of Americans 
and Cubans alike. 

The story of little Elian haunts 
me sti ll . 

On Thanksgiving Day 1999, 5-
year-old E1ian was found clinging 
to a life prese.rver drifting off the 
coast of Florida. His mother and 
10 others drowned, yet E1ian still 
clung to life. Miraculously, after 44 
hours at sea he was rescued and 
brought to American soil, the land 
of freedom, which his mother had 
risked - and lost - her life to 
reach. 

Images of Elian 's teddy bear-like 
face are forever seared into my 
memory and into my heart: Elian 

Sun God: 
Tips for making future 
Sun Gods even better 
Continued from page 4 
concerns seem to be a main reason 
why many acrs do not get signed or 
even considered.The A.S. pro-
gramming office has S80,OOO to 
play with for Sun God. But remem-
ber, acrs are vety expensive. One 
year, Lenny Kravitz wanted 

playing outside his Miami relatives' 
home; riding a yellow bike, 

But the one picture of Elian that 
haunts me is that of his face 
scrunched up in absolute terror as 
he is faced with a commando's 
assault rifle when government offi-
cials forcibly removed him from 
the Miami relatives' home. 

We betrayed Elian. His mother 
died to achieve the dream of free-
dom for her son, and we sent him 
back to grow up under the oppres-
sive dictatorship of Fidel Castro. 

So if it's not tOO much trouble, 
Mr. Carter, as you visit the biore-
search facilities, talk with dissidenrs 
and meet with Castro, would you 
check on Elian's welfare for all of us 
in the United States who still care 
and are worried about his mental 
and physical well-being? 

When the United States and 
Cuba were battling over Elian 
almost two years ago, Castro 
promised that upon his remrn, 
Elian would rerum to his home-
town in Cardenas and return to a 
normal life with his father, step-
mother and baby hal f-brother. 

And Elian did return to his 

Sloo,OOO. (Note to self: Rock stars 
a re greedy). 

But the fact still remains, if 
UCSD wanrs the big-name artisrs, 
it has to pay the big bucks. One of 
the easiest things to do to increase 
the budget is to sell tickers for the 
Sun God festival. Sure, this breaks 
the tradition of a free concert, but 
it's time that UCSD studenrs cough 
up a few dollars for the show to 
help the A.S. programmers get us 
the good acts. 

Fifth , fireworks : Hey, if all else 

father's house in Cardenas in cen-
ttal Cuba. It is green and by stan-
dards of the community, not a bad 
house to live in. 

Elian is now a third-grader and 
attends a neighborhood school. 
Elian's favorite subject in school is 
mathematics. 

From the mJ£Side looking in, 
Elian's life seems normal. 

But things are far from normal. 
E1ian has a 24-hour bodyguard 

who keeps away anyone the party 
officials (read as Castro) don't want 
Elian to interact with, in order to 
safeguard his "normal life." Those 
denied access are the press and any 
political officials from the United 
States who aren't on Castro's invit-
ed list. 

Elian even has his own museum. 
Castto dedicated the museum to 
the custody war over Elian and to 
celebrate Cuba's victory over evil 
capitalism. It is located in his 
hometown of Cardenas and is 
called the Museum for the Battle of 
Ideas. 

But really, it is E1ian's museum, 
charting how Cuba defied U.S. 
aggression and ensured the safe 

fails, drop a few thousand on a 
fireworks show. Everyone likes 
fireworks, right> Don't worry, 
those old La Jolla snobs will get 
over it . 

Sixth, beer garden: Not essen-
tial, but it can make a big differ-
ence. 

The Sun God festival is the 
biggest concert that UCSD will 
see each year and every effort 
should be made to make it the best 
concert of the year. That means 
there must be a litde more creativ-

return of their son Elian. The 
museum is made complete with a 
statue of Elian; made to his exact 
likeness, courtesy of Castro. 

Elian, though only eight, has 
become a permanent fixture in 
Castro's politics. Elian is paraded in 
front of political rallies, with the 
caring and grandfatherly Castro 
right by his side. 

When Castro addressed a mil-
lion Cubans on the May Day cele-
brations, standing among the invit-
ed dignitaries at the front was Elian 
Gonzalez, the guest of honor. 

At his seventh birthday party 
last year, Castro dropped in with 
Thabo Mbeki, the South African 
president. Both leaders took the 
time to ruffle Elian's hair. 

Up next for little Elian is to 
accompany his protector Castto to 
a meeting with Mexico's head of 
state President Vicente Fox, 

Clearly, Elian has become the 
political poster chi ld of the triumph 
of communism. Castro flaunts 
Elian as his prize in his victory 
against capitalism and the evil 
America. 

So when exactly is Elian allowed 

ity involved when organizing the 
concen. Look at different genres 
of music. Embrace up-and-coming 
acts on the verge of making it big, 
not the old has-beens. Make the 
most of the money that is available 
by getting more quali ty, and sacri -
fice some of the quantity. Or sell 
tickets to the evening concert to 
increase the budget. 

The A.S. festivals coordinators 
have done an incredi bl.e job of 
working their magic to bring us 
the best possible artis:s for the 

to be a "normal" child? When 
Castro is dragging him to political 
rallies as the guest of honor or 
meeting with foreign heads of 
state? 

Yeah, right. 
Castro obviously doesn't give a 

damn whether Elian has a "normal" 
life. Elian is being exploited in the 
worst possi ble way. Castro has 
robbed Elian of a childhood in 
order to further his own political 
communist aspirations. 

Yet, no one seems to care what is 
happening with Iitde Elian. 

We sent Elian back there, thus it 
is our responsibility to ensure Elian 
lives as normal of life as possible. 

That IS why it essential, 
President Carter, for you to visit 
Elian. Not just a quick hello in the 
presence of family, Castro or 
E1ian's bodyguard. Alone. Where 
you can meet with him and speak 
with him privately to find out if he 
is OX 

Castro has given you a virtual 
free reign of his island, allowing 
you to meet with anyone you 
please. 

For Elian's sake, make the call. 

concen. Cake is a definitely a step 
forward toward more establi shed 
and well -known artists. They have 
the tunes and the energy to head-
line a festival. I am not trying to 
disrespect the coordinators of the 
Sun God festival but, hopefully, 
some of my ideas can stimulate 
some minds to start thinking of 
ways to make the Sun God festival 
bi gger a nd better. 

In the mean time, enjoy the 
show, because it should be a good 
one.

Graduates: More to life than a job 
Seniors should open their eyes to other possibilities 
By SIMONE SANTINI 
Senior Staff Writer 

For some of you who are reading 
these lines, this is your last quarter at 
UCSD. In a few weeks you will 
graduate and leave. Graduation will 
be a time of celebration (and rightly 
so), and I don't want to spoil tile 
party. So, having some things to say 
tllat might not be exactly celebrato-
ry, I'd rather do it now, while we arc 
still a few weeks away from the fatal 
moment. Given my limited knowl-
edge ofllie situation of omer majors, 
I will mainly address my colleagues 
in the school of engineering (l am a 
computer scientist) . 

as little rime as possible before 
putting you to work. The situation 
might be different for students in me 
humanities, hard sciences or social 
sciences, but me advance of the cor-
porate engineer is transfonning peo-
ple wim a shred of culture into an 
endangered species. 

Things will not improve, tmfor-
tunately, after graduation. If every-
ming goes according to plan you will 
find a good job with decent pay and 
a health plan tlut may even, on spe-
cial occasions, allow you to sec a 
doctor for a few seconds. 

these cases you should make an eXIra 
effort to he! p your co-workers, but 
be suspicious if these occasions 
become a permanent emergency. 
Your boss is just trying to make the 
work of mree people with one salary. 

Don't place tile interests of the 
company above your personal life: 
Remember that the company is 
never going to do tile same for you.

For starters, I need [Q tell you 
something quite harsh. I wish I could 
find a way to sugarcoat it a bit, but I 
don't know how, so, here it is: Most 
of what you learned here is absolute-
ly useless. There, I said it. 

The strong corporate influence 
on UCSD made it so mat, in tile last 
four years, you received mainly job 
training, rather man the education 
for which you originally enrolled at 
UCSD. Some graduates have only 
the faintest idea of subjects such as 
history, literature or philosophy, but 
also of tile very theoretical bases of 
the discipline mat tlley studied, of its 
social importance, or of its cultural 
value. 

Your bosses will tell you ma tit is 
important that you care for the com-
pany, that you hould always feel parr 
of a team, that working hard is a 
great virnle. and mat hard work will 
have its rewards . They will tell you 
tllat working 14 hours a day and on 
weekends is good and noble, and 
mat this temporary sacrifice is me 
key to a successful life. 

They arc lying. 
D on't believe a word mey say. 

They will want you to live only for 
me company, to have no life, no 
friends outside of work and no inter-
ests. Don't fall into their trap. 

Don't let them convi nee you to 
eat your lunch at your desk: It is one 
of tile saddest sights in me world. ,0 
Out, relax, have a nice slow lunch, a 
glass of wine and a nice cup of mffec, 
and take me time to read the books 
that you could n't rc.1d in college, 
(busy as you were writing progrnms). 

Whatever you do, don't give up 
your vacations. You have very few, 
anyway - typically twO weeks versus 
the six weeks of your European col-
leag1les - and you will receive a lot 
of pressure not to take them or, in 
any case, to take them a few days at a 
time, so that you will not disrupt the 
important projects in which you are 
invo lved . Don't /,rive up: lake your 
two weeks, go wherever you like, and 
forget about your work. 

We sell boxes, locks and packing supplies Many engineering students leave school with little more than a bag of 
technical tricks that tlley could have 
picked up for a much lower price at a 
technical institute or a few monms of 
studying $500 worth of technical 
manuals. The fact is, the CQJl1panics 
mat pour money into UCSD don't 
really need you to be educated - I 
suspect that they prefer you unedu-
cated, in fact - but they want you to 
be well-trained, so that mey can waste 

Don't make your life revolve 
around work. Be sure you always 
have enough time and energy to go 
out with friends, go to the meater, 
play music or do whatever it is that 
you like to do. 

Move into a house near a 
Landmark meater, a bookstore, a 
coffee house, a bar and a few restau-
rants, and don't forget to go out 
ofte n: Four times a week is the 
absolute minimulTI . 

Finally, don't give too much 
weight to your career. It is impormnr 
that you reach a level in which you 
make enough money for a comfort-
able living, but all the talk you hear 
about "making it" is a Iluke. In many 
cases, your career will eat up your 
personal interests, destroy your fam-
ily life, your liver and your heart (not 
necessarily in tlus order).

Court upholds race policy at Michigan 
Law school to continue to use affirmative action 

(KRT) DETROIT - With a 
narrow appeals court victory 
Tuesday, the University of 
Michigan law school won the right 
to continue considering race in its 
admissio ns policies while the 
schoo l braces for a likel y hi storic 
appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. 

[f tile high court agrees to hear 
the case, the outcome could affect 
coll ege admissions policies across 
the country. 

On Tuesday, the U.S. 6th Circuit 
Court of Appeals in Cincinnati mlcd 
5 -4 that me race-con~cious admis-
sions policy at UM's law school is 
legal. The decision reversed a Mareh 
200 1 ruling by a federal district 
judge in Detroit. 

"We find that the law school has 
a compelling sta le interest in 
achieving a diverse st1ldent body," 
the appea ls court wrote in its opin-
ion , T he court cited testimo ny 
from school officials, saying the 
testimony assured tllem that, "In 
considering race and emnicity, the 
law school does not set aside or 
reserve seats for underrepresent.~d 
minority students. " 

A decision on UM's admissions 
policy for undergraduate students 
is pending in the same court and a 
decision is expected soon. 

UM had argued mat race is one 
of many factors in its admissions 
process and that diversity improves 
me education of all students. The 
university had spent millions of 
dollars defending mat argument 
si nce me case was filed in 1997. 

"This is a great day for the 
University of Michigan and all of 
higher education," said Marvin 
Krislov, UM general counsel. "The 
court recognizes that diversity 
brings benefits for majority and 
minority students. The court rec-
ognizes that diversity is a COI11-
pellir)g state interest and that our 
policy is narrowly tailored to 
achieve that interest." 

But the university's victory 
could be short-lived. 

Kirk Kolbo, an anorney repre-
senting Barbara Grutter, who sued 
the UM law school in 1997, said 
the decision will be appealed to me 
U.S. Supreme Court. 

"I've anticipated frol11 the 

begitu1ing that mis would have to 
go to the Supreme Court, and 
today's decision just takes us one 
step closer," Grutter said. 

Kolbo said he was opti mistic 
mat the high court would take on 
the issue. 

"Today's 5-4 decision shows 
how closely divided the court is on 
thi s issue," he said . "The only place 
that this issue can be decided is the 
Supreme Court." 

As in Michigan, similar cases in 
other states have resulted in rulings 
by lower courts that conflict with 
each other. Because appeals of dif-
fering decisions in cases in 
Georgia, Texas and Washington 
have either been refused by the 
Supreme Court or abandoned by 
the universities, the UM law school 
case stands a better chance of being 
heard by the U.S. Supreme Court, 
legal scholars say. 

Judge Danny Bogg , who wrote 
the dissenting opinion, blasted the 
law school admissions policy as U a 
straightforward instance of racia l

Colleges react to admissions ruling 
Court's decision raises questions for other schools 

(U-WlRE) ANN ARBOR, 
Mich . - Although the verdict 
given Tuesday by the 6th Circuit 
Coun of Appeals does not in itself 
necessarily directly affect them, 
schools and colleges around the 
country have been paying close 
attention to the lawsuits aga inst the 
University of Michigan. 

"We're very pleased," University 
of Texas law professor Douglas 
Laycock said. "It doesn't do anything 
to help us in the short run, but we 
have certainly been aware of it." 

In the long run, if the Supreme 
Court decides to hear it, the case 
could affect not only the University 
of Texas, where the Hopwood deci-
sion outlawed race·conscious adnus-
sions in every school in the 5th 
Circuit, as well as schools in the 
states of Texas, Mississippi and 
Louisiana, but every college nation-
wide. 

"I think it increases the likeli-
hood that the Supreme Court will 
take your case, and the Supreme 
Court is me on ly thing that can 
help us now," Laycock said. "The 
rest of me couno), would be better 
off if mey take it and affirm it." 

Since me Hopwood decision, 
Texas has been using what Laycock 
described as "colorblind" admis-
sions. The new policy has had an 
unfortunate effect on the diversity 
of the student body at Texas, 
Laycock said. 

"We carmot consider race, so 
what we can do is very aggressively 
recruit the minority sUldents that 
we mi ght be able to admit," he said. 
"Minority enrollment plummeted 
right after Hopwood - it's back up 
again, but not nearly to where it 
was." 

Laycock also contends that 
omer methods of preserving diver-

sity have failed in comparison to 
affirmative action programs. 

"Affirmative action is me only 
way to get reasonable diversity and 
maintain higher aeademic stan -
dards, but all the other ways of 
going about maintaining diversity 
get fewer minority students at 
higher academic COSts," he added. 

California is in a similar siula-
tion in terms of its admissions poli-
cies, though the Supreme Court's 
decision will not affect schools in 
that state because of Proposition 
209, a state law passed by 
California voters in a 1995 
statewide referendum that banned 
the use of race in college admis-
sions. 

Last summer, the 22 UC 
regents repealed their support of 
the ban, saying mat they believed

Marshall: 
Organizers wanted to 
spell out consequences 
Continued from page 1 
beer googles on. 

The mangled car on exhibit 
"gives a powerful message to stu-
dents that these are some of the 
consequences" if students drink 
and drive, Miller explained. 

The car is so badly damaged 
that part of its roof is nearly per-
pendicular to the ground and the 
two front doors arc nearly touch-
ing each other. 

"All I can tell is tha t there 
were at least three people in the 
car," Smart said. "Nobody sur-
vived." 

Miller found out about the car 
from the towing company. 

"It was a rea l car that was 
involved with alcohol and abuse of 
alcohol," Miller said. 

UCSD student Mike Waser 
said he found it "very hard to 
understand" why accidents like 
this happen when people know 
that they should not drink and 
drive. 

"J think that they aren't plan-
ning this ... but it happens anyway," 
Waser said. 

Another exhibit outside the 
Marshall dean's office lISes cups to 
symbolize the average number of 
college students who die from inci-
dents involving alcohol in a three-
week period. 

Upon reading a posted sign 
stating that four college srudents 
die from alcohol incidents every 
day, Marshall freshman Lindsay 
Tabaian said that she was not sur-
prised. 

"I would think it would be 
more, actually," Tabaian said. 

Tabaian said that she knows 
people who are planning to drink 
alcohol at the Sun God festival. 

" I don't think that JUSt by hav-
ing an exhibit people will change 
their behavior," she said . "People 
know this stuff already. People 
know that alcohol is dangerous." 

Race: 
Court contends diversity 
compliments education 
Continued from page 7 
discrimination ... Even a cursory 
glance at the law school's admis-
sions data reveals the staggering 
magnitude of the law school's 
racial preference. 

"Its admissions officers have 
swapped tailor's shears for a chain-
saw ... Michigan's plan does not 
seek diversity for education's sake. 
It seeks racial numbers for the 
sake of the comfort that those 
abstract numbers may bring." 

Some UM students applauded 
the appeals court decision. 

"I thought it was fair and that 
the lawsuit was ridiculous to begin 
with," said Bisera V1ahovljak, a 
senior psychology major from 
Detroit. "I believe in the positive 
benefits of diversity, and how it 
can enhance our education. It's 
essential." 

But James Justin Wilson, edi-
tor of the Michigll1l Rroitw, a con-
servative student publication, crit-
icized the courts ruling Tuesday. 

"I think it's an injustice," 
Wilson said. "Affirmative action is 
racism in action." 

The lawsuit against the ' law 
school was filed Dec. 3, 1997 by 
Gruner, 48, of Plymouth 
Township, Mich., who claimed 
she was denied admission in 
favor of less-qualified minori-
ties. 

A similar lawsuit against UM's 
undergraduate admissions policies 
was filed Oct. 14, 1997 byJennifer 
Gratz and Patrick Hamacher. The 
court is considering that case but 
did not release a decision on it 
Tuesday. A ruling is expected 
soon. 

See IUUNG. Page 9 

rHURSDAY, MAY' 16, 2002 

Ruling: 
Court finds UM's case 
fits into Bakke decision 
Continued from page 8 

In both cases, the plaintiffs are 
represented by the Center for 
Individual Rights, a public interest 
law firm in Washington, The two 
cases were consolidated by the 
appeals court and oral arguments 
were heard Dec. 6 by the court's 
entire nine-judge panel. It was the 
first university admissions case to 
be heard by a full panel. Similar 
cases in l c xas; Wllshington and 
Georgia were heard by three-j udge 
panels. 

Legal scholars say they hope the 
high court will review the UM 
cases to clarify its 1978 Bakke case 
ruling that said race could be used 
as one of many factors in admis-
sions. 

U M uses race as a factor in 
deciding whom to admit, with the 
goal of diversifying its student 
body, which it says benefits all stu-
dents. T his year, UM received 
24,5 11 applications for about 5,300 
seats in its fall freshman class, 
according to UM data. 

At the law school, there were 
5,260 applications this year for 
about 36 1 seats, accordi ng to law 
school data . Minority students 
represent about 23 percent of the 

Reaction: 
Some schools hope 
case goes to high courts 
Continued from page 7 
banni ng the policies sent out a 
negative message to their students. 

Joe Wills, director of public 
affairs at Chico State University, 
said tha t he does not feel 
California's color-blind admissions 
process is the best policy. 

"[Proposition 209) made it dif-
ficult to realize our mission, whjch 
is to make as much educational 
access to as many people as possi-
ble," Wills said. 

Wills sa id that although it will 

tota l enrollment of 1,098 stu-
dents. 

But lawyers representing the 
three white srudents who sued UM 
say race is used as a determining 
factor and white students are 
denied admissions in favor of less-
qualified minorities. 

John Payton, lead counsel for 
UM in both cases, lauded Tuesday'S 
decision . 

" It clearly vindicates wha t 
we've been saying about the edu-
cational mission of the law 
school," he said. 

A key factor in UM's victory was 
that the court found the law school 
admissions policy agrees with the 
Bakke decision and is precisely tai-
lored to meet that criteria: using 
race as only one factor to meet the 
goal of diversity, said Wayne State 
University law professor Robert 
Sedler. 

Ted Shaw, associate director of 
the NAACP Legal Defense and 
Educational Fund, who represents 
smdent intervenors in the under-
graduate case, said the appea ls 
court ru ling that Bakke is binding 
and diversity is a compelling state 
interest could mean the judges will 
reach the same conclusion in the 
undergraduate case. A decision on 
that case is expected soon.

not a ffect Chico Sta te, he is hop-
ing that the case will go to the 
Supreme Court so that other uni -
versi ties can create race-con-
scious admissions policies and 
reap the benefit of a diverse stu-
dent body. 

Said University of Michigan 
IOterim Provost Paul Courant: "I 
think the universities that have 
been subject to decisions from 
their courts that have gone the 
other way have had a hard time in 
effecrively promoting diversity in 
their srudent body."

Let them eat Cake 
Sacramento headliners put on the icing 

By JOSEPH LEE 
Hiatus Editor 

W e have our Cake and we can eat it, too. Cake is familiar to those from the Sacramento scene, and for the rest of 
us, we know them from hits such as "The 
Distance" and "Never There." Last summer, 
"Short Skirt Long Jacket" was also a hit on 
the radio waves. 

My earliest memory of Cake was when 1 
was in high school and I heard the song, 
"The Distance." T he funky instrumentation, 
the signature horn solo and spoken-word 
quali ty of the singer made thi s single stand 
out. [ would often find myself humming, 
"He's going the distance. H e's going . .. for .. . 
speed. He's all alone. All alone in a time of 
need ," while I was marching (0 my next class. 

This eclectic rock group consists of the 
unique vocal style oOohn McRea, the plain-
tive trumpet-playing of Vince Di Fiore, the 
slick drumming ski lls of Todd Roper, funk 
bass playing by Gabe Nelson and guitar licks 
from Xan McCurdy. 

"Motorcade of Genero ity" was Cake's 
first release in 1994 and was met with great 
reviews. They broke out on the scene in 1996 

with "Fashion Nugget" and their catchy hit, 
"The Distance," in which a slightly country 
twang accompanied a funk-jazz SOrt of sound . 
Their rendition of the 1970s disco hit "I Will 
Survive" is a great cover. In their 1998 album, 
"Prolonging the Magic" prolonged their 
career with more catchy tunes like "Never 
There" and "Let Me Go." 

Their most recent album was released last 
summer. "Comfort Eagle" mainta ins the 
same quirL.'Y non-sequitur lyrics and the same 
bounce to their songs. "Short Skirt Long 
Jacket" was the radio hit that resulted from 
that album . 

Cake is one of those bands that seem to 
beat the odds with a coupl e of radio hits from 
each album they release. T heir unique sound 
is a breath of fresh ai r from the distorted 
mess often found on the radio waves. They 
really don't have obsessive fan Web sites or a 
throng of devoted followers, and I don't 
think [ would see them winning any lifetime 
achievement awards. But they are a solid 
band who knows how to entertain the crowd 
with a healthy set of singable songs. 

And when you're feeding off the energy of 
thousands of drunken revelers, all you'll want 
to do is sing and dance. Piece of Cake.

They have No Use for a Name 
Veteran punk rockers to jam at Sun God 

By DAVID BYNUM 
Staff Writer 

No Use for a Names journey to playing the famous (or infamous) Sun God fes-tival began 16 years ago in Sunnydale, 
Calif. Building their talent and fan base slow-
ly but surely, the band has released six full-
length albums, a live album, four EPs and 
"Hard Rock Bottom" will be released by Fat 
Wreck Chords on June 18. 

The band has done more than tour the 
California coast in their many years. They 

have effectively helped shape the face of the 
new punk rock that emerged during the 
midlife of the average UCSD Triton. With 
contemporaries such as MxPx and former 
Sun God festival act Face to Face, No Use 
for a Name gave meaning to the idea of 
West Coast punk rock and altered the ado-
lescence of more than a few West Coast 
punks.

Wake up to Knoc-Tum'al beats 
Bright start for Dr. Ore's protege 

By ANNE CONG·HUYEN 
Senior Staff Writer 

The hori zon looks bright for Dr. Ore's fl edgling hip-hop artist Knoc-Turn 'a I. The Southern Ca lifornia native from 
Long Beach began a troubled life after his 
parents separated when he was 12 , but he 
eventuall y turned his life around to 
become the recogni z.ed recording artist 
that he is. 

Wtth a love for musie that was instilled in 
him partly by his musically inclined father, 
Knoc began his foray into music at an early 
age. He says one of his earliest memories 
that fueled his dream of pursuing a music 
career was at a Rick James concert with his 
father at the age of nine. By his teenage 
years, Knoc (as he is endearingly known by 
his fans) bega n rhyming in the fashion of his 
heroes Eric B, Rakim, DeBarge and Cameo. 

But instead of a direct road to stardom, 
Knoc was sentenced to four years in prison 
for what he call s "robbing and stupid shit 
like that." His dreary years in prison, how-

ever, did not pass without their own lessons. 
Acquiring a newfound respect for life during 
his dehumanizing experience behind bars, 
Knoc continued to learn and perfect his 
musical skills. 

It was in prison that Knoc, then known 
as Royal, met another inmate named 
Crybaby who supported him in his endeav-
ors to rhyme and write. Crybaby also 
bestowed upon Royal his new name, 
"Knoc-Turn'al," for his work shifts and 
devoted hours of rhyming that occurred late 
into the nights. 

After being released from prison and 
resolved to turn his life around, Knoc met 
record magnate Big 0 of L.A. 
Confidential, who introduced Knoc to the 
legendary Dr. Ore. Knoc then proceeded 
to impress Ore with an impromptu perfor-
mance of three bars. This momentous 
meeting led to a recording session, a 
friendship and partnership, the results of 
which are tlle amazingly pupular colla bora-

There's more to do than •.. 
Daytime stage, booths part of the fun 

By JOSEPH LEE 
Hiatus Editor 

Start your Sun God partying early. Beginning at 10 a.m. there will be all sorts of things to keep you busy as you 
try to hide your frothy beverage in the 
sports bottle you got at the beginning of the 
year. There will be 65 booths scattered 
around Library Walk, Sun God Lawn and 
near the stage in the Price Center to dazzle 
and amaze you. 

Spend your hard-earned cash for sou-
venirs and get yourself tank tops, baseball T-
shirts, key chains, temporary tattoos, pint 
glasses and shot glasses. 

Various campus organiz.ations will vie for 

your attention with a carnivalesque atmos-
phere. Circle K will have a Rubber Duck 
race in the Price Center fountain . The 
UCSD Dance Sport Team, Triton Cheer 
and Stunt Team and Triton Twirl Flags 
Team are sure to pump up the crowd with 
funky music and sparkling dance moves. 
Astrojumps wi ll be available for your amuse-
ment near Sun God Lawn. And Tht Koala 
staff will have a game table that should pro-
vide more entertainment than you can han-
dle. 

This is definitely the day to skip some 
classes, enjoy some fresh air and spend the 
day wandering around campus. Daytime fes-

Fivecrown beats a pair 
Local band offers the royal treatment 

By BRENT HECHT 
Staff Writer 

Five Crown did nor add a sixth vestige of power to its name-sake when it won this year's 
Batde of the Bands, but it certainly 
deserved to do so. 

For this foursome of local musi-
cal talent, victory last week in the 
A.S. programming office contest 
was a major coup d'e tat. Not even 
an original finalist, the band was 
invited at the last minute to per-
form in the finals at the Price 
Center after one of the original 
finalists backed ou t. 

The underdog band then man-
aged to swoon, rock and mellow-
out the audience and the judges 
enough to steal the conrest's prime 
prize: the right to open the huge-
by-UCSD-standards Sun God con-
cert. 

Four years and two full-length 
albums after its initial formation, 
the band is now poised to play one 
of the most important shows in its 
mid -length existence. The only 
UCSO student in the band, drum-
mer and Thurgood Marshall 
College junior Trace Smith, is 
ecstatic about the opportunity to 
play for his fellow UCSD students. 

"This will be probably our 
biggest show [so far] in terms of 
number of people," said Smith, a 
recently married electrical engi-
neering major who divides his time

A blast to the past 
Take a look back into previous years' Sun Gods 

By MARA EVANS 
Staff Writer 

Ask any old-timer around cam-pus about UCSO's famous Sun God festival, and they get a lit-
tle misty-eyed. The rypical 
response you'll get is something to 
the effect of: For one tremendous 
day, UCSO gets to act like a real 
college. Some may find it hard to 
envision this phenomenon, but 
UCSD students are like elephants 
who can't forget the good times. 

Every Sun God aficionado has 
Sun God memories. Or they have 
no memories, depending on how 
much they drank. The memory of 
headlining band "Oishwalla" in 
2000 makes some people cringe. 
Painful recollections aside, what is 
it that excites us each year as the 
Sun God festival rolls around? 

"It's the one time that we get to 
let our hair down and close the 

books to just relax and get freaky," 
said Andrew Shim, an Earl 
Warren College junior. "It doesn't 
matter what race, ethnicity or reli-
gion you are. Sun God is just 
everyone coming together to 
enjoy the fun and the exciting 
atmosphere. II • 

The festive atmosphere con-
tri butes to anxiety over who's per-
forming. 

"The biggest deal about Sun 
God is the anticipa tion, " concurred 
Brandon Freeman, the festivals 
coordinator for A,S. programming. 
"It basically makes people's year." 

This anticipation rides on 
"remember whens" that encompass 
not only the bands, but the booths 
and the all-day entertainment as 
well. The booths on Library Walk 
are no longer infonnational, but 
recreational. Past favorites include 
the Samba de Amigo and Inflatable 
Boxing Ring, as well as carnival-

style games, with which Tbf Koala 
staff usually push the envelope. 
Some booths have even set records. 
last year's Union of Jewish 
Students set a head-shaving record 
of over 100 heads in four hours 
with proceeds going to a local char-
ity. 

"Of course, the best booths are 
the ones with food. lots and lots of 
food," said James Yu, a Revelle 
senior who has never missed a Sun 
God festival. "Plus the perfor-
mances at Price Center are always 
good!" 

For many, the fun is not restrict-
ed to the vicinity of Library Walk. 
Don't be surprised to see' people 
frolicking in fountains with huge 
inflatable rubber ducks as they have 
in past years, or playing games of 
Frisbee and football anywhere and 
everywhere. And no one ever for-

CAKE 

It 
Cake 

Comfort Eagle 
Columbia 

*** Cake has a unique 
blend of funky sounds and 
nonsequi tur lyrics. In fact, 
the more I think about it 
and the more I listen to 
"Comfort Eagle," the 
more I think the band 
emulates a lot of Beck 
styles in its music. 

Cake is probably bener 
known for the album 
"Fashion Nugget," which 
sold more than one million 
copies and was fueled by the 
hit song "The Distance." 
The mellow cover of "I 
Will Survive" also proved to 
be a catchy tune. 

Cake's electic sound 
includes a hip-hop drum 
beat, surf guitars, a funky 
bassline, the signanlre 
trumpet solos and the half-
singing half-rapping vocal 
stylings oOohn McCrea . 

And don't forget the 

lyrics tha t sound a lot more 
strange when you actually 
give the album a careful li s-
ten. Songs 011 the most 
recent release ("Com fOf! 
Eagle") such as "Opera 
Si nger" and uShadow 
Stabbing," are simply odd 
- but they are damn 
catchy. The faux-rap metal 
song "Comfort Eagle" is 
sure to dazzle and confuse, 
but like the rest of these 
songs, it's incredibly catchy. 

The radio hit U hort 
Skirt/Long Jacket" com-
bines the best of Cake all 
rolled into one ong with 
funky beats, slick produc-
tion and lyrics such as, "I 
want a girl with the right 
allocations, who is fast, and 
thorough, and sharp as a 
tack ." The song comes 
complete with a classic 
break before the launch of a 
yell -along chorus and call-
backs. And don't forget the 
telltale trumpet solo. 

Cake seems to have 
those songs that encourage 
the crowd to yell back at 
the band with fists thrust 
into the air. Although 
"Comfort Eagle" is not as 
good as previous works, it 
is another welcome addi-
tion to Cake fans and those 
who convert after watching 
Cake at the Sun God festi-
val.

No Use for 
a Name 

Hard Rock Bottom 
Fat Wreck Chords 

No Use fo r a Name is 
part of the pop-punk wave 
that has gained so much 
popularity in the past few 
years. Though largely sim-
ilar to the myriad of other 
punk bands swarming in 
the scene these days, 0 
U se for a ame still man-
ages to pave a unique pa th 
along such a traveled route. 

Songs such as "Dumb 
Reminders" have a bitter-
sweet feel; in fact, that is a 
good expression for the 
entire album. The manda-
tory fast-paced, hyper 
drumming and guitar work 
that characterizes punk is 
given the time on the 
album one would expect, 
but is alternated with slow-
er, more expressive parts. 
The most surprising thing 
on the album is a cover of 

the Sinead O'Connor song 
"This Is a Rebel Song," 
which is complete with a 
female vocalist. 

There are plenty of 
songs that are, well .. , just 
punk to a non-hard core fan . 
"Any Number Can Play" 
sounds like just about any 
other plink band to emerge 
in the last few years. 

Don 't expect much 
deviance from the norm in 
lyrics; all the songs 
NUFAN write are prett), 
much about break-ups and 
the usual stuff. 

De pile their hardcore 
moniker, some of the best 
sounds come out no t when 
NUFAN are pounding out 
as many power chords as 
possible; the softer intros 
on tracks like " let Me 
Down" offer a respite that 
is sonically refreshing. 

In the end, "I-lard Rock 
Bottom" isn 't a revolution-
ary album, but it's not dan-
gerously generic either. 
True, it is a bit bland at 
times : People who don't 
wet themselves with desire 
over a catchy punk album 
might not find too much to 
keep their anention long. 
NUFAN sound like what 
they are, a So-Cal punk 
band, if that's your thing, 
go for the gusto!

With the SUI1 God festival, 
though, it 's each to thcir OWI1, 'incc 
others cou ld chose from 1993's 
"Blues Trnveler," "No Douht" from 
t 994 or evcn "3 t t " in t 995. Many 
cnjoy dancing to the trance and 
house mixes of the OJ and 
Vinylphile Club between sets in a 
specially-equipped tent. 

Despi te its low-key beginnings 
20 years ago, the Sun God festival 
this year will undoubtedly conti nue 
to build upon the legacy that is Sun

Continued from page 24

\l'llhulIt any prior experience in

heg.,n to find her niche in the 
sport . 

She became interested III

\\'ho attended the school, but she 
cl'cnQlaliy planned to gu to UC 

Courtesy of UCSD Athletics 
Graduating: Emma Kudntzk, 

Davis. However, one latc phone 
call changed everything. 

"About an hour before my 
graduation night, r received a 
phone call from coach H,uper," 
Kudritzki said. "I Ie told me that 
there was sti ll a chance that I 
could go to San Diego, and so I 
rook it." 

The deci sio n turned OUt to 
be a sa\'i ng grace for the 
Trito ns. 

Kudrit7.ki ea rned three conseClI-
tive all-\VWPA selections as well as 
being recogni zed as an AII-
American in 200 I. She is ranked 
fourth all-time at UCSD with 62 
goals in one season and is in the wp 
five for career goa ls. 

Hcmmcrly consistently 
improved her goals and assists the 
past three seasons, and as a senior, 
finished with career highs in goals 
(31) and assists (47) . She also pro-
vided important essentials that led 
to the continued teamwork and 
success of the team. 

"Courtney was a strong leader 
and had the crucial intangibles that 
helped [UCSD] play and work 
together as a team," said junior 
Samara Silverman. 

Playing together the past fOllr 
years has also formed a special 
bond between the two stars, as well 
as their teammates. 

"[eourmey and IJ have become 
dose teammates and friends, and 
knowing we've shared some surreal 

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

moments really connected us in a 
way that's ju t hard to describe," 
Kudritzki said . "I love her to 
death." 

. Hemmerly agreed, adding, 
U\iVe're best buddie . We've been 
through a lot together and share 
some great memories." 

The seniors' teammates share 
similar sentiments. 

" It definitely will be strange not 

'The special 
relationship I formed 

with my teammates 
and the passion and 
desire we all shared 

is something 1'1/ 
miss.' 

-Emma Kudrlntskl 
Graduating 

water polo player 

seeing them play with [the team), 
and being such a c1osc-kni t group, 
I'll miss them dearly as friends, as 
well," Silverman said. 

Boyle agreed, but remained 
focused on the upcoming sea-
son. 

"The team has been so close over 
the last few years that [Hemmerly 
and Kudritzki) will be very missed," 
she said . "But we have to look for-

ward and get ready for next season." 
While both of the seniors look 

forward to continue playing 
beyond their college careers, they 
also have goals set for their bright 
futures. 

Hemmerly looks to pursue 
teaching and counseling children, 
and Kudritzki hopes to get a start 
in the winery business and per-
ha ps run her own vineyard. 
However, both admit they will 
miss the thrill of playing at the 
competitive level. 

"The special relationship r 
formed with my teammates and the 
passion and desire we all shared is 
somcthing ['II rcally miss," 
Kudritzki said. "Putting in 110 per-
cent into something for eight years 
and having it end is like losing a 
part of yourscl f." 

Hemmcrly seemed a little more 
optimistic. 

'Til definitely miss playing," 
she said. "Watching [the team] 
play will bring back some old nos-
talgic memories, but it's time to 
move on and I'll be cheering for 
them. " 

While the women's water polo 
team has lost twO assets in 
Hemmerly and Kudritzki, hopes 
for next season are sti ll strong 
with a solid core of returning 
players burning with desire to 
show this past season was no 
fluke.

Team player: Courtney Hemmerly 

[Kudritzki and I-Iemmerly] will 
probably give the so-called experts 
reason to yet again underestimate 
[the team], even though we secm to 
play better than expected all the 
rime," Silverman said. "We have 
some great young players on this 
team and I clunk we'll do just fine 
next year." 

The future looks promising, 
but Kudritzki and Hemmerly 
leave big holes for Sandcrs and 
his team to fill. They will be 
missed and remembered for set-
ting a standard as ideal student-
athletes.

J3ADMINTON 
In only its second year as a club 

sport at UCSD, the ,,*dmiow.a 
dub team established itself as a 
force in more than the world of 
collegiate badminton. 

This season saw UCSD end its 
year in a Snit-place tie with co-
champion UC Inine, with both 
schools finishing with a 4-1 
record. The twO teams share the 
title, but UC Jrvine has a higher 
seed than UCSD based on the 
strength of Irvine's sweep in the 
badminton postseason tourna-
ment. UCSD's attempt [0 steal 
the crown from ue I.rv:ine fell 
short this year, but UeSD is 
pleased with the improvement. 

Last year, UeSD tied for first 
with ut Irvine and UCLA. but the 
disorganization and informality of 
the newly formed league cast doubt 
on its placement. This year, in the 
midst of II more organized league, 
uem again found itself legiti-
mately at the tOp, with no questions 
as to the vt.'t'acity of its stwding. 

A large part ofUCSD's success 
this year came courtesy of Dede 
Davis, who e2rned' the most 
match and team points of any 
other UCSD badminton athlere 
this year. 

The team also attributeS much 
of its jmproved performance to 
the addition of coach Mike 
Walker. Not only has Wa1ker 
worked on improving the UCSD 
athletes' rechni.que, he has also 
attracted a much broader base of 
student interest by turning dle

The UCSD waterski ream 6n-
ished: its 2002 campaign with five 
tournament wins, four second-
place finishes and one fourth-
pb.ce finish. However, the sole 
fourth-place finish came at the 
wom time, when UCSD was 
foiled by champions Arizona St'Jte 
in the regionalsand ended just 
one spot short of traveling to the 
nationals while the tOp three 
teanlS in the regionals advance. 
On the women's waterski side, 
UCSD missed nationals by just 
one slcier, showing hdw close 
UCSD came to advaoci.tlg. 

Senior Tom Stour led UCSD 
with a phenomenal senior year 
and w~s an integral part of 
ucsm high rankinp. His most 
notable accomplishment was his 
demolishing of the UCSD water-
sIci jump record with a jump of

The team also managed to 
qualify three skiers for the 
Western Regio.a All·Star team in

Professional basketball 
not what it use to be 
Continued from pap 24 
ball league is being swamped by an 
increasing number of college 
underclassmen and high school 
players deciding to enter the NBA 
draft without the high-class ability. 

This spring, 36 athletes who 
did not finish college have 
declared themselves eligible for 
the draft, which will be held June 
26. In fact, five players of this 
group who will be waiting for 
NBA Commissioner David Stern 
to call their names will be at the 
draft just weeks after their high 
school graduations. 

Most of these early entrants into 
the draft would have been much 
better off with more time develop-
ing their skills at the collegiate 
level, 

However, there have been 
young athletes who went to the 
NBA earlier than most and proba-
bly made the right decision to 
forgo a college education. One 
such example is Minnesota s star 
Kevin Garnett, who started the 
tidal wave of young athletes turn-
ing professional by being the first 
player in over 10 years to make the 
jump from high school to the NBA 
seven years ago. 

While Garnett has developed 
into a star and an intimidating 
opponent, even his success came 
after a short struggle. During his 
first professional season, the 18-

gested that the team's feeling is 
defined by more than just wins or 
losses. 

"We're obviously disappointed 
- not necessarily because we lost, 
but because we know that we didn't 
play up to our caliber of play," she 
said. 

While her teams season ends on 
a sour note, Gerckens said that this 
team has set a standard for the 
future, 

"We've set a tradition now with 
an expectation that we should strive 
for regionals and we should go," 
Gerckens said. "We've had a lot of 
peaks and valleys during the season 
and we could have folded but we 
didn't." 

Martinelli thinks that once the 

year-old was constandy held under 
a microscope, making it difficult 
for him to learn with so many 
watching him. 

He could have gone to a 
Division I school, where his educa-
tion would have been paid for with 
a scholarship. It would have been to 
his benefit to spend at least one 
year learning and developing his 
game in a place where his ego 
wouldn't have to completely fill his 
seven-foot stature. 

Garnett's success, along with a

"Automatically, I think we all

season we had." 

The Tritons end their season 
with an overall record of 35 -2 5, 
including a blistering 13 -1 start and 
a national ranlcing that climbed as

largest challenge he's faced is 
sneaking off his high school cam-
pus for lunch? Perhaps he should 
have gone to a prestigious universi-
ty, learned the game under a strong 
coach and picked up an education 
along the way. 

Although Curry wasn't actually 
quite ready to be a professional, 
some people thought he was, and 
he tried to prove it, Why wouldn't 
Curry go to the NBA if an organi-
zation like the Chicago Bulls would 
pay an 18-year-old over $2 million 
per year? But why is a young, inex-
perienced player like Curry even 
encouraged? 

Owners need to realize that tal-
ent isn't so sparse. The Bulls could 
have found a lot of guys [0 play like 
Curry did for $2 million. College 
ftesrunen and high school players 
don't need multi-million dollar con-
tracts, because then they have 
already proven themselves and really 
have no good reason to stay in 
school. 

Professional teams should see 
that a player with four years of 
experience would be able to con-
tribute at the ultimate level. The 
younger, talented athletes still 
have to learn how to play the 
game, and they aren't worth more 
than a scholarship. 

Until franchises make the wise 
pick of the player who already has 
years of experience, the NBA will 
continue sliding downhill.

Y eah, I'll say it. I'll proclaim it to

loudly. To my friends 
from LQs Angeles I'll 
especially make a 
point of saying it; I'll 
freely declare it here, 
just a stone's throw 
from L.A. 

I bl/,e the Lakers. 
But 1 don't even know if the banal 

word "hate" can de cribe my feelings 
toward those lucrative lackeys of Los 
Angeles. Loathe comes close when 
you pronounce it wi th emphasis and 
roll the "I" up to the top of your 
mouth wi th your tongue and really 
taste the word.

the two people still reading this col-
umn (thanks, Mom and Dad) out of 
the grand total of four who started 
reading it (my brother and some 
hobo using GlIordioll pages as a blan-
ke t). Let me count the ways ... 

T he Lakers have no personality 
as a team. Look at them: They are 
just a bunch of mercenaries brought 
to the City of Angels by the money 
dribbling from general manager 
Jeny West's hands. 

They are analogous to the 
Yankees, in that the team is com-
prised of talent bought at the highest 
possible price, which makes for a 
"team" that is imply a squad of sole-
ly self-interested individuals. 

I don't see how anyone can root 
for them. I mean, yeah - obvious-
ly they have a bunch of talented 
individuals, but they are perhaps 
the laziest players in the NBA. 
With the amount of collective tal-
ent that they possess, they should 
have blown San Antonio straight 
out of the playoff waters. 

True, on paper the Lakers won the 
series 4-1. But that doesn't tell the 
true story by any means. How many 
times did the Lakers come from 
behind? If the five games were ended 
after the third quarter, the Spurs 
would be winning the series 3-2. Yet 
in the fourth quarter, the Lalcers 
would always suddenly look around, 
realize they could lose and actually 
start playing to their full potential. 

Some may say this is the mark of 
a good team: being able to respond 
in the clutch. I don't think so. Why 
can't the team play like that for four 
whole quarters? Then they wouldn't 
even need to have to be able to pull 
out last-minute victories. I say its an 
even better team that thoroughly 
dominates their opponents for the 
whole 46 minutes. 

Not only do I despise the Lakers as 
a team, but as individuals the majority 
of them manage to piss me off as well. 

Kobe Bryant is definitely an ath-
letically gifted individual - whose 
talent is only surpassed by his ego.

throws up shot after shot. And hey, it 
works. But when you start relying

Softba'll suffers quick exit from playoffs 
Losses to Bakersfield and Chico State end season 

Guardian file photo 
Swingin' sticks: UCSD's offense, which lifted the team throughout much of the season, was absent in the NCAA Division II West Regional Tournament 

By BRYCE WARWICK 
Staff Writer 

After a strong finish to the 
UCSD softball team's season, 
which earned it the third seed in 
the West Regional Tournament, 
the Tritons dropped their first 
two games in the double-elimina-
tion competition. 

An impotent Triton offense 
amassed only five hits over the 
two games in the final two losses, 
which brought the Tritons' 
record for the season to 35 -25 . 

The first game of the tourna-
ment matched a pair of 20-game 
winners, with Erin Kelly (24-8) 
throwing for the Cal State 
Bakersfield Roadrunners against 
UCSD's ace, Christi Martinelli 

(20-9). With high-quality pitchers 
on the mound, the Tritons found 
out early that runs were bound to 
be scarce, and mistakes extremely 
costly. 

After a scoreless first inning, 
the Roadrunners received a gift 
run from UCSD in the second. 
With a Bakersfield runner on first 
base and two outs, Roadrunner 
first baseman Kristie Smith hit a 
fly ball that Triton right fielder 
Jamie Hurst misjudged for a two-
base error that brought in the first 
run of the game. Bakersfield added 
two more runs in the third inning 
to open up a 3-0 lead that would 
hold up against the cold Triton 
bats. 

Kelly's performance for the 
Roadrunners merited praise 

when she struck out six and 
walked none while going the dis-
tance for the complete game 
shutout. Among the six strikeouts 
were two ca lled third strikes, 
which irked UCSD head coach 
Patti Gerckens. 

"The reason we didn't hit is 
that we watched too many strikes 
go by," she said. 

Martinelli had a much simpler 
explanation. 

"We just didn 't hit the ball," 
she said. 

The next day, on the verge of 
elimination, the desperate Tritons 
met with another club that could 
not afford to lose: the Wildcats of 
Chico State University. 

The Tritons came out looking 
to turn on the offense they'd 

Women's water polo loses key duo 
Kudritzki and Hemmerly end great careers 
By JEFF CHUNG 
Staff Writer 

In the current world of col-
lege sports, it is no longer com-
mon to see players mature from 
their early careers as freshmen 
into solid, capable senior lead-
ers. In the major sports with 
professional aspirations, it is 
even more rare to see such a 
thing. 

However, for the UCSD 
women's water polo team, the 
desire and determination of two 
outstanding seniors has led to a 
remarkable and resurgent growth 
in the competition of the pro-
gram. 

Both Emma Kudritzki and 
Courtney Hemmerly have faced, 
the troubles and frustrations of 
playing a coUegiate sport during 
their illustrious careers, but they 

finished their tenures by return-
ing the Tritons to championship-
contending form. 

Starting all four years while 
on the team, Kudritzki and 
Hemmerly have been consistent 
and integral to the team's suc-
cess. They provided the Tritons 
with inspiring leadership and 
plenty of offense, combining for 
93 goals this year and 263 goals 
over the past three seasons. 
With their experience and 
insight, both players provided 
the maturity and work ethic that 
propelled the Tritons to the 
Western Water Polo 
Association conference champi-
onship game. 

"Emma and Courtney were 
great leaders for the younger 
players to learn from, n said junior 
teammate Danielle Boyle. "They 
provided an excellent role model 

for the team." 
That they both ended up 

playing at UCSD is a miracle 
in itself. Hemmerly began her 
water polo career at 
Clairemont High School play-
ing on the men's team until her 
senior year, when a women's 
team was created. She original-
ly did not plan to attend 
UCSD, but with the help of 
former UCSD assistant coach 
and current San Diego State 
University head water polo 
coach Karen Crawford, she was 
given the opportunity to try 
out for then-head coach Denny 
Harper. Harper was sufficient-
ly impressed to help her 
through late admi~sions and 
enroll at UCSD. 

Meanwhile, Kudritzki start-

lacked the previous day, but 
Wildcat pitcher Katie Stokx had 
other ideas. 

UCSD pitcher Leea Harlan 
blanked Chico State for three 
innings, but Stokx matched her 
frame-for-frame, and the game 
was shaping up to be a pitchers' 
duel. 

However, in the fourth, the 
Wildcats struck first. Two singles 
and two of Chico State's three 
triples in the game gave the 
Wildcats three runs and a lead that 
they would hold tightly. 

Triton shortstop Kim Aggabao 
singled to break up Stokx's no-hit 
bid, but UCSD managed only one 
other hit for the rest of the game
