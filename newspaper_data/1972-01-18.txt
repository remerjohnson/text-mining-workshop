The results of a student-evaluation of 
professors and their classes should remain 
secret. This is the conclusion of a sub-
committee of the Council for Undergraduate 
Affairs, chaired by John Stewart, provost at 
Muir College. This recommendation is being 
opposed by students at UCSD who feel that the 
results of such an evaluation should be made 
public.

Reviews Information 

But. Michael aid . before making a 
recommendation to Hitch about the 
measur . he wanted to review 
informatIOn from speclall t on the 
Un iversity faculty. 

Thus. he stated . the letter was 
mailed to about 80 or 85 facult\' 
members. About 35 or 40 responded to 
the three qu stlOn . 
" Would the law. If adopted . constitute 
ound public polic~"", " Would the 

Untver'II\"s ba IC fun ctIOn of 
t achlOg and research b affe ted?". 
and " Would the law have the practical 
eff c t of limiting your research

optIOns which. onthe basi of sCientifiC 
Inqulty and pollution re earch. should 
b left open?" 
The third que tions lin two parts) 
generated the mo t di spute 

According to Koupal. who apparently 
received a copy of the letter from an 
angry profes or . the question aid . in 
effect. that the ballot measure would 
reduce research grant . Thus. it 
encouraged the faculty members to 
d velop arguments again t it. 

But. Koupal argued, the measure 
would encourage research in new 
areas. such as organic agriculture, 
nuclear fusion I the law would delav 
only nuclear fi ion plants) and sola'r 
energy. 

" If we are gomg to talk about the 
effect on research .' he said. " let s 
look at all the areas equally It Will 
bring out more re earch dollar. than 
they've ever n " 

Koupal also dented :\llchael' 
contentIOn that the off- hore drtlllng 
ban would affect 011 revenues. He said 
that 0 ean wells can b . lant drtlled

UCSD rogram to train underqualified employees 

DEDP director sel'ected 
LoUIS M. Lake . former 

director of Archie Moore 's 
" Any Boy Can " youth 
program, has been named to 
direct the Disadvantaged 
Employee Development 
Program IDEDP I operated 
by the University of 
California . San Diego. 

The program. directed by 
the UCSD Personnel Office. 
was establi hed on the 
campus two and a half years 
ago to recruit. train , and 
place 10 jobs individuals from 
all ethnic groups in the San 
Diego Community who did not 
meet minimum qualifications 
for employment. Most of 
these people were either on 
we lf a r e or were 
underemployed with incomes 
below the recognized poverty 
level 

Since the program 's 
beginning in June. 1969. over 
130 trainees have been placed 
10 jobs in the community and 
on the University campus In 
the pas t six months alone 42 
persons have been trained 
and 38 have been hired into 
full time em plo yment. 
According to Universi ty 
records. the job retentton 
rate among those placed at 
UC D is an Impressive 97 per 
cent. In add ilion. over 10 per 
cent of Ihose placed have 
received promotion 

Lake. a 6·fool. 4·inch 
former Manne Corps and San 
Diego State College 
basketball pla~'e r . brings a 
background of per onnel and 
employment work with him to 
the Job of Director of DEDP 
A native of Seattle. 
Wa shington . he attended both 
San Diego State and the 
Californl.l Western campus of 
UOited States InternatIOnal 

University majoring in 
clinical psychology and 
political science . He worked 
for three years as an 
employment counselor with 
the Department of 

Employment 1 now 
Resources Development 1 and 
for four years as Director of 
the ABC Youth Prog ram 
before JOlmnl( the staff at 

CSD. 
Lake and hiS Wife Barbara 

have two children. He IS a 
chart er member of the 
outhea t San Diego Optimi t 

Club and . as a hobby. is 
interested in teaching the art 
of elf defense such as boxing 
and karate . 

One of his first projects 
with DEDP is a name change. 

"There are currently 18 
trainees in classroom work 
and 43 others in on·the·job 
training pOSitions around the 
ca mpus ," Lake said . 
"Certainly these people come 
from disadvantaged areas of 
the city and several of them 
don 't even have high school 
diplomas but once they start 

in the campus program 
disadvantages begin to d 
away. " he said. "I'm pushing 
for a name that will depict the 
progressive na ture of the 
training and the 
results that have been shown 
so far." 

Funding for DEDP 
come from several agenci 
including the 
Opportunity Commission of 
San Diego County which 
provides stipends for student 
trainees. the University wide 
Urban Crises program. and 
the San Diego City Schools 
Adult Education Division 
which provides textbooks and 
teachers . The main source of 
operating funds is the San 
Diego Model Cities Program 
which has increased its 
funding for the coming year. 

DEDP concentrates on the 
hard-core unemployed and 
those below poverty income 
levels. using the Department 
of Labor's criteria as a guide . 
Most of the trainees who have 
gone through the program did 
not meet the minimum 
qualifica tions for 
employment set by the 
University of California . To 
train these individuals to a 
qualifiable level. a two·phase 
program has been developed . 
Phase I brings trainees to an 
entry level. or beginning 
levei. position . Phase II is 
designed to train individuals 
to fill laboratory and clerical 
positions. . 

Candidates for upgrading 
through Phase II are 
continually sought by the 
DEDP staff and the UCSD 
Pe rso nnel Office . T 
training for Pha e II depends 
on the job requirements and 
the education and skills .

Coastal High Rise and San Diego 
Of cou rse. a big issue In arguments over hll(h nse IS that of 

property rights - whether or not a person has a right to 
ITIaX lmlZe the returns from his land without an\' restr ictIOns 
trom government. ThiS issue has already been pretty well 
settled in the past through legislation and court decisions 
Government doe hav:, the fi ght to regula te land use and set 

hel~htlimits in order to protec t such Intangible value a order 
and beautv. 

Restriction are al 0 valid for more direct reason We a re 
an mterdependent people. ;-';0 man is an Island What on 
person does with his land affects others. Thev Will have to look 
at It and live with il. The value of one's land 'is not determined 
solei.> b.v the Individual improvements built on il. It is also 
affected in a very large manner by the quality of what is put up 
around II. There can b losses as well as gains denved from the 
acti vities of others. In other posh areas like La Jolla. such as 
West wood Village in Los Angeles and Honolulu . there has been 
a tendency of overdevelopment in the form of high rise to 
destroy those very qualities that made those areas deSirable 
place to live and the land valuabl e. Therefore . it is entirely 
reasonable for a community to place limits on how far 
individual property owners can go in the rugged., selfish pursuit 
01 their own interests. In the recent election for mayor. both 
Pete Wilson and Ed Butler favored controls over coastal areas 
With respect to height. Ed Butler in particular remark"!! that 
"pla~' ing the high ri es should be like playing the stock 
market" with no guaranteed returns on land bought for 
speCUla tive purposes in hopes of redeveloping at higher 
heights and densities. 

Fortunately. a permanent solution appears to be developing 
In rhe form of a petition drive organized by VOTE I Voters 
Organized to Think Environmenu. It would enact a 30 foot 

. height limit over the coastal area west of Interstate 5 and north 
of downtown. Having obtained 36.000 signatures. well above the 
min imum 26.000 needed . it will go 'On the June ballot. It is a 
much ·needed . comprehensive ordinance that would replace the 
present patchwork of temporary height limits applying only to 
parts of the coastline and leaving others unprotected . It would 
also free citizens'S groups from having to go every year or so in 
Iront of the city council to get them to extend the temporar~' 
height limits. Finallv . it would lessen the en e of 
powerlessness many 'residents feel they have over the

environment In which thev live . There wll! be a greater amount 
of certainty as to what their communltle Will look like In the 
future . 

I urge all l'C D studen ts reg ister d to vote to upport thiS 
measure If It comes up In June I would al 0 hope that tho e 
slill not registered will register This will be a chance to 
personally do something to control the effects of undirected 
economic growth on the environment before II I too late 

Of a ll the environmental Issues facmg San Dlel(o. that of high 
flSe along our coastline ha been one of the mo t controversial 
and bl tlerl\' contested 

Coa ta l tllgh rises are unde irable for everal rea ons ,\ lin 
of them. like in Honolulu and ;\1laml Beach. blocks the view of 
the ocean for the rest of those living further mland and on the 
hills. A row of high rise form ing a wall along the ocean front IS 
not the most attractive Sight visually Also. the properties 
behmd them tend to lose value. becoming blighted or 
deteriorated such as the bUildings behind ,'lew York 's Central 
Park and Chlcago's Cold Coast along Lake Michigan 

In both areas. the apparent beauty from the front is only km 
deep. High rises abng the coast cause land values to fl se 
astronomically to the point that it IS diffi cult for smgle family 
homes and even two or three story apartments to remain there 
because of economic pressure and taxes. HIgh rises also 
contribute to traffic congestion and generally overcrowd 
already crowded beach areas. The proper place for tall 
bUildings is downtown where they would contribute to Its 
redevelopment and would be in keeping with 'its urban 
character. instead of being out of place and destructive to the 
character of our coastal beach communities. 

Coastal high rise made its appearance in La Jolla beginning 
in the mid 6iJs and since then has spread rapidly in succession 
to other areas along the coast. Though temporary height limits 
and downzonings were hastil~' employed to stop them (though 
always after the first one or two got through I. they were onl~' 
partially effective. 

In La Jolla. the residents . spurred into action by the 
construction of the 939 Coast Apartments . got the cit~' council 
to enact a temporary height limit over the central area . Then. 
as part of the implementation of the La Jolla Community Plan. 
several areas zoned R·4 la reSIdential deSignation whose 
den ity allows high n e I were downzoned to R·3 lone With fa r

Bob d. Leonardis 
Most of you are probably somewhat 

familiar with the non-rhythmical, non-
melodic experimental electronic noise which 
occupies the attention of so many musicians. 
My first prolonged encounter with it 
occurred this fall in East Asian Cultural 
Traditions IA ; almost everyone in the class 
whom I spoke to was unable to understand or 
enjoy it. For awhile I tried to put aside my 
initial impressions and accepted the 
instructor's statement that there was 
something valuable in the noise (not said 
derogatorily , but only because I cannot see 
how the subject can be called " music"), and 
that it just took considerable time and effort 
to really appreciate it. When most of us 
failed to make any progress toward this goal 
during the ensuing weeks . I was compelled to 
change my attitude. 

The whole class couldn 't be that wrong ; 
while unable to prove this . 1 was instinctively 
sure that the problem lay not in the students 
but in the material studied. My line of 
reasoning is not a rabid, flag-waving attack 
on the course or its instructor ; everything in 
the class except the electronic noise had real 
value. Rather. it raises serious doubts about 
the validity of electronic noise as real music 
or art of any sort , and thereby calls into 
question the wisdom of including such a 
subject in a required course. 

Af ter some thinking. it is easy to conclude 
that not only is electrOniC noise not music , it 
probably isn ' t even art of any sort. 
Proponents of the experimental sound quite 
naturally object to any contention that it isn't 
music : they are quick to poi nt out that an 
artist can use the noise to exe rt a ve ry strong 
effect on listeners. Admittedly, this point 
cannot be argued. Yuasa's Icon, perhaps the 
most memorable work that we listened to, 
did an excellent job of achieving Yuasa 's 
annou nced objective of conveyi ng to the 
listener a sensa tion of ex panding 

The flaw in this attitude is twofold : (1) the 
use of sound effects to induce emotions is not 
new, and (2 ) throughout history, the 
question , " Are sound effects music? " has 
been answered repeatedly with a flat , 
unequivocal NO, In the early 1800 's, for 
example, the war cry of the Basque 
mountaineers, shrilly descending in the dead 
of night down the chilly slopes of the 
Pyrenees Mountains , struck terror into the 
best troops Napoleon could put in the field; 
later in that same century, the celebrated 
Rebel Yell had similar effects on Union 
soldiers. However, no one ever regarded 
these as music . 

Other similar examples can be found as lar 
back as the first century A.D., when the 
Roman writer Pliny described a " haunted" 
house in Athens as being filled with the 
clanking of chains, while a howling wind has 
been effectively utilized by many fables 
since the beginning of time. This last 
example is especially revealing, since much 
of Yuasa 's leon and music for the textile 
pavilion at Expo '70 derives its effect from a 
sound much like that of howling wind. But is 
it music? To answer yes, we must suddenly 
and arbitrarily contradict the judgment of 
every generation of the human race who has 
lived before us . 

Many supporters of experimental sound 
are. however, prepared to take this step. 
Their contention is that Western people have 
always used melody and rhythm as criteria 
fo r music: but music need not possess the e 
qualities , as is ev idenced, they cla im, by t~e 
traditional music of other cultures. ThiS 
argument would be good except for one 
hitch: which cultures? Cultures as diverse 
and dissimilar to that of the West as those of 
the American Indian and African tribes. 
have always used a great amount of rhythm 
in thei r drumming and dancing. The example 
which is always brought up is that of the Far 
East. but even here. the argument fails.
