UCSD's 

ACADEMIC 
OFFERED AT 

2nd COLLEGE 
What? Classrooms in Quonset 

huts? Temporarydormitories? 
Is this John Muir College? 

Pioneering Muirians will find 
further primitive accommoda-
tions as they move into their 
Matthews Campus headquarter s 
today. After the first r ains 
entering freshmen and junior~ 
will understand why last year's 
residents i n Matthews were 
known as th "Dirty Diehards." 
It's a long walk from Matth ws 
to Revelle, especially when the 
rains com • But these men can 
take it--they'r e following in the 
footsteps of th i r h r o John 
Muir, pion er of the wild, wild 
West. 

But, says John Stewart , pro-
vost of UCSD 's s cond college 
Muir i s for the adventuresome: 

"One difference between the 
two colleges," Stewart ex-
plains, "is that Muir students 
have more options and time to 
meet the breadth requirements 
than their colleagues in Revelle 
have." 

In fact there are 5 dille rent 
ways to meet the math require-

ment, 4 for humanities, 2 for 
science, and 12 for contempor-
ary issues. 

Having such a freedom of 
choice, however, challenges the 
student to define his educational 
goals before he even samples 
his tough college curriculum. 
Each freshman is assigned a 
facu lty adviser during Orienta-
tion Week in order to plan an 
educational program with 
"balance and rationale." 

"The student and adviser sit 
down togeth r," says Stewart , 
"and plan an academic program 
for the whol year, which the 
stud nt has developed by him-
self beforehand. At this time 
the adviser helps the st udent 
define his goals, nd after con-
sidering the results of the 
placem nt t sts taken during 
this week, a schedule of classes 
is worked out." 

Unlike Muir, Revelle College 
offers a vigor ous curriculum 
which leaves little time fo; 
electives in the lower division.

GALBRAITH 
RESIGNS 

TWO MAJOR TOP-LEVEL 
ADMINISTRA TIVE CHANGES 
GREATLY AFFECTING THE 
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA 
AND ITS SAN DIEGO CAMPUS 
WERE ANNOUNCED FRIDAY 
AFTERNOON BY THE UNI-
VERSITY BOARD OF REGENTS 
MEETING ON THE LOS 
ANGELES CAMPUS. 

In a late afternooo sessioo 
the board accepted t!le resig-
nation of Dr. John S. Galbraith 
as Chancellor of the San Diego 
campus, a post be has held 
since December I, 1964. In 
an earlier session, the board 
named Vice President Charles 
J. Hitch as President of the 
University. 

Galbraith resigned his post--
effective September 1968--in 
order to accept the prestigious 
Smuts Visiting Fellowship at 
Cambridge University for the 
year 1968-69. Galbraith's 
resignation', submitted a year 
in advance to permit the Re-
gents ample time to select a 
successor, was announced 
following the meeting by Re-
g nts' Chairman Theodore R. 
Meyer and UC' s Acting Presi-
dent Harry R. Wellman. 

The 50-year old Galbraith a 
native of Glasgow, Scotland,' is 
an authority on British Empire 
history. The Smuts Fellowship 
is named after Jan Cbristian 
Smuts, the tamed Prime MiD1s-

of the Union of South Africa. 
Galbraith has been Chan-

cellor at San Diego since Dec-
emher I, 1964. In the inter-
vening three years, under his 
leadership, enrollment at UCSD 
has grown from 500 to about 
3,100 students. Wellman, in a 
letter acknowledging "with re-
gret.. Galbraith's resignation, 
not..ed that he had "made very 
important contributions to the 
welt.are of that campus and to 
the University," assembling 
"an excellent administrative 
staff" and adding "to an already ' 
outstanding faculty." 

Wellman told Galbraith that 
"you can be justifiably proud 
of the progress which the cam-
pus has made under your 
leadership." And he termed the 
Cambridge appointment "a well 
deserved recognition of your 
high scholarship" which "adds 
to the distinction of the Uni-
versity" of California. 

Galbraith said he would leav 
San Diego "with very great 
regret.. but believed "that I 
sbould return to teaching and 
scholarship.' ' 

The Chancellor received a 
B.A. degre from Miami Uni-
versity, Oxford, Ohio, in 1938, 
and Master's and the Ph.D. 
degrees from the University of 
Iowa. He taught at Osceola 
Junior College and the Univers-

DR. JOHN GALBRAITH 

World War II to serve as His-
torical Officer for the Army's 
Third Air Force. In 1946-
47 he was Associate Professor 
and chairman of the history 
department at Mount Union Col-
lege in Alliance, Ohio, and 
Assistant Professor at Ohio 
University in 1947-48. 

Dr. Galbraith joined the 
faculty of UCLA in 1948 as an 
Assistant Professor, becoming 
Associate Professor in 1952 and 
Professor in 1958. In July, 
1964, he went to San Diego, 
serving brieny as Vice Chan-
cellor and Professor of History 
until his appointment as Chan-
cellor. 

Following the announcement 
or his resignation, Dr. Gal-
bralth released the following 
prepared statement: 

During the past thr e y ars I 
have been an administrator in 
one of the most exciting educa-
tional developments in the 
Unit d States and in the most 
attractive environm nt, phy ic-
ally and climatically, in the 
country. 

The Regent s arched for 
more than a year before naming 
Galbraith as CbaDce 

If I were to continue in ad-
ministration, I can think of no 
other university with which I 
would wish to be associated. 
But I have had to make achoice 
between administration and 
scholarship, and I have con-
cluded that if I am to r eturn to 
scholarship, I must do so soon. 

The invitation from Cam-
bridge brought the issue to a 
focus, and I have decided to 
accept the Smuts Visiting Fel-
lowship in 1968-69. This is 
the reason--the sole reason--
for the decisi on. 

Galbraith is the second chan-
cellor to serv UCSD in the 
short history of th campus. 
He succ ded Dr. Herbert York 
who announced his resignation 
in 1963 for r easons of he.u.tb. 
Dr. York has r mained on the 
UCSD campu as a Professor 
of Physics. 

Hitch, 57, former assistant 
.S, S cretary ot Det nse, was 

named to succ d ousted Presi-
dent Clark Kerr. Reliable 
sourc s said that Hitch was 
given the backing of Governor 
Reagan, who voted for Kerr's 

Grants Go 
To 23 Frosh 

Twenty-three students who 
will be entering freshmen this 
fall have been named to receive 
UCSD Honorary Alumni Schol-
arships. Sixteen of the stu-
dents are from San Diego 
County. 

Tom Ham, president of the 
Honorary Alumni, announced 
that a total of $20,524 has been 
made available in financial aids 
to the students, who were chosen 
on the basis of their educational 
promise and financial need. 

The scholarship money in-
cludes donations by Honorary 
Alumni, matched by Regents' 
funds from the New Campus 
Program, and Educational Op-
portunity Grants, student loans 
and work-study grants, Ham 
said. 

UCSD Honorary Alumni con-
sist of San Diegans dedicated to 
assisting the young campus, 
which does not yet have an 
alumni group of its own. For 
several years, the Honorary 
Alumni have provided financial 
assistance to entering freshmen 
showing high academl~ prom-
ise.

"Incidental Fee" -
The Mysterious Benefactor 

Tbe guns of complaint always spew forth when the word Is out that tuition may be demanded or that 
some other miscellaneous fee may be tacked onto the increasing list of student grleV1U\ces. Yet whUe 
tb1s barrage of artillery is going on outside, very few seek to find out where the $700,000 we pay 
every year is eDding up. 

1b1s huge sum, mysteriously labeled "Incidental Fees," has some tremendous uses of which we 
sbou1d all be aware. Contrary to the idea that CalUornia state taxes are providing all of our spacious 
DlOIluments to architecture, these student paid "Incidental Fees" have produced the newly completed 
natatorium. 

How wUl the future Matthews student activities building be able to rise from the ground level? Only 
1DcIdeDtal fees paid by the students w111 nourish its growth. The bleachers at the new gym from which 
tbe University students will cheer our basketball team will be provided by these "Incidental Fees." 

Similarly, when the radio station has been completed, incidental fees wlll have paid a sizeable chunk 
~ tbe final bUl. 

Despite the Immensity of these projects, the greatest single service these fees uphold is the Student 
IiealtII Service. One third of the entire quarter's revenue made through "Incidental Fees" keeps 
the crowing ranks of UCSD student physically capable to face one of the most rigorous curriculums 
lit the country. 

Just a few more illustrations. 
Tbe $ - check we make out to the University each quarter also pumps the blood of the intercollegiate 

sports system. Guidance counseling, laboratory fees, use of library books, placement services, stu-
deal publication equipment, and student planned lectures and programs all piJlcb their peMies trom 
the same pocket. 

Wbat makes these dollars greener than those donated by the Regents of tbe UDlversity Is that the 
eJp8Ddlture and control of these funds are, in large part, a privilege of the students. in particular, 
A. S. Vice-President Herv Sweetwood, UCSD undergraduate Helen Cost and graduate student D. A. 
JobDson comprise the advisory committee which works closely with the Chancellor in the channeling 
0I.1be mooey. 

Yet, there are students wbo would have us believe that the University Is an evO usurper of student 
lDDueoce which has its great bulk deployed for exclusive use in the "Sap-student-strength" league of 
America. 

WhOe the University maIntains certain controls over students' activities, some would want student 
acth1t1es free from such social, political and academic "barriers to progress." What would the 
rest 01. us have in exchange? A ship without a rudder, a tree without roots. 

Tbese mysterious "Incidental Fees," then, are one of the students' most effective assets at UCSD. 
TIley provide the student body with an excellent means of translating Its enthusiastic hopes into the 
taDcible hallmarks of a fine university. 

Tbere Is even some corolort for the wary, for they can feel confident that students are there to 
help out and divide this big pie. Arter all, isn't this one of our best assurances against the possibility 

~ a "tyrannical" admlnlstration?

UCSD CHANCELLOR 
Dr. John Galbraith 

Chancellor's Welcome : 

Whatever else one may say 
of UCSD, it cannot be said that 
we are static and unchanging. 
Those of you who ar e returning 
will see quite a change in the 
phys ical appearance olthe cam-
pus. There will be continued 
physical change throughout your 
tenure here, andIor many years 
thereafter. I hope that this 
characteristic also reflects our 
receptivity to new ideas. This 
campus is young, and it would 
be sad it it were already suf-
fering from hardening of the 
arteries. I think I can speak 
for the provosts and for the 
faculty when I say that we 
welcome student participation 
in making UCSD a truly out-
standing university and that we 
hope that you will join with us 

as members of the university 
community to that end. 

My best wishes to all of 
you for a successful year. 

Background: 
Alter 16 years at UCLA as a 

history professor, Chancellor 
Galbraith · succeeded Herbert 
York on December I, 1964 as 
the second chancellor of UCSD. 

Chancellor John S. Galbraith 
is a noted authority on British 
Empire History. He also is a 
member of several organi-
zations, including the American 
Historical Association, Society 
of American Historians, Royal 
Historical Society, the African 
Studies Association, Canadian 
HIstorical Association, and Phi 
Beta Kappa. 

The Galbraiths have three 
children and reside at Univers-
ity House in La Jolla Farms.

AS PRESIDENT 
Richard Altenhoff 

Welcome from Associated Student Body Pres ident: 

There was a time when Re-
velle College was nothing more 
than a conglomeration of mud 
flats and bulldozers. Returning 
students will recall this chaotic 
period with a touch of nostalgia. 
Notice, however, that Revelle 
is now completed and for the 
[irst time has usable sidewalks. 
Revelle, rejoice! 

Muir College students be-
ware ... : your "home" is not 
your own. You are now located 
in the .. staging college. II That 
dust blowing across Miramar 
Road is part of your permanent 
campus; when the dust clears 
Muir College will appear. 

Yes, all UCSD students have 
been and will continue to be 
subjected to a life of wet cement 
and plywood sidewalks. New 

s tudents must be oriented to 
this liCe at "Malleable U;" 
those of you continuing must 
re-orient yourselves to the fact 
that we are now UCSD and not 
just Revelle College . 

Things, however, are not as 
grim as they appear. In addi-
tion to physical construction, 
construction is also taking place 
in Educational Policy, your AS 
and a multitude of other aspects 
concerning students. 

We've come a long way 
through the mud and plywood 
sidewalks, and now with the 
addition of the new students and 
the anticipated cooperation of 
many--optimism is the word 
for '67- '68. 

Welcome to UCSO!

P.E. CONSTRUCTION REVIEW CONTINUES 
BASKETBALL TEAM HAS 
HIGH HOPES 

With six returning lettermen 
as a nucleus, Coach Neale 
Stoner plans to build an im-
proved basketball team to match 
the improved schedule. 

John Thomas leads the con-
tinuing cagers back on the court. 
Thomas was the team 's leading 
scorer and top reboWlder last 
year. Dick Reither man, the 
6'6" center from two years ago 
who sat out this last season, 
will be back to vie for that 
position. 

Coach Stoner, speaking of his 
new prospects, spoke highly of ' 
a jWlior college transfer. Bill 
Flatley, 6'1" guard brings im-
press ive credentials from the 
Glendale Junior College. 

The freshmen team will take 
on a much more ambitious 
schedule than last year, said 
Stoner. The frosh coach, Barry 
CUlUlingham, is expected to 
greatly improve the junior cir-
cuit. The stan-out player from 
5 years ago at Cal Western 
will welcome 21 freshmen pros-
pects to UCSD . One of the top 
players of these newcomers 
is 6'2" guard Steve Thompson 
from Costa Mesa. The coaches 
see him as a fine player with a 
good style. 

The possibility has arisen for 
a local tournament to be planned 
for the frosh teams ofth area's 
fou r-year schools. This would 
be an alUlual event with the site 
rotating between the four 
schools involved. Coach Stoner 
said he would like to see the 
same type of tournament se t up 
with the varsity teams com-
peting. He felt that such a 
city-wide championship would 
create enthusiasm in both the 
players and the spectators . 

When asked what he thought 
the highlites of the season would 
be, Coach Stoner said that the 
Christmas Tournament, Dec. 28 
through 30 and the Riverside 
Classic in January could be 
counted as top events . Stoner's 
two toughest opponents, how-
ever, are thought to be Cal 
Western and the University of 
Redlands. Discuss ing this idea, 
stoner observed, "Redlands 
always fields an excellent 
team."

extremely diverSified, and is 
growing all the time. We have 
sucb sports as karate and inter-
collegiate surfing, and this year 
we w111 oUer swimming, water 
polo crew and baseball tor 

The 24 game s late provides 
for 7home, 8 tournament, and 9 
away games. The s ite of the 
home games has been moved to 
the Miramar NAS gym rather 
than La J olla Country Day, 
which has been home ground in 
the past. The P.E. depart-
ment is working out an arrange-
ment with the Navy to provide 
easy student access to the 
games. 

All told, Stoner looks at the 
approaching season with cau-

Open Leite r to Prospective Athletes 

Dear Student : 
We invite you to extend your activity by joining us In the Uni-

ve rs ity or California at San Diego intercollegiate athletic program. 
Now in it s fourth year of development, the program is growing by 
leaps and bounds, and includ s basketball, baseball, wrestling, rub-
by, crew, sailing, golf, cross- count r y, track , tennis, swimming and 
water po lo, and is well worth your consld ration. The number of 
teams is mushrooming, and the quality of the existing ones Is 
soaring. Your participation will benefit you tremendously and can 
help better the program ven more. 

You undoubl dly have heard of the trem ndolls academic work 
load here at UCSD , but be assured, you will have time for sports If 
you merely budget your time wise ly. TOOr will be a meeting on 
Wednesday, Sept. 27 , to explain the program. It will be held at 
7:00 in the Blake Hall Lounge, (Re ve lle), and any questions you have 
concerning our activities can be answered. 

The architect ' s model of the 
Phys ical Education complex 
consists of the Natatorium, or 
indoor swimming pool and the 
Physical Education building 
which is now under construc-
tion. 

Th pool is now open for stu-
dent use , and will be the s ite 
for the swimming and water 
polo teams . Though scheduled 
for completion sometime this 
year, the P.E, Building has run 
into unfortunate delays , and 
hopes are now set on finishing 
early in 1968. 

The P.E. Building, located 
just north of the Revelle cam-
pus, wil l have two floors and a 
mezzanine (intermediate fl oor 
area) with a combined area oC 
52,000 sq. Ct. When completed, 
the facilities will include lock-
er s , showe rs, dressing and 
training rooms, and the inter-
collegiate squads will op rate 
from there. 

The main fl oo r has room 
for two r egu lation s ize lJasket-
ball cour ts and seating. With 
this in mind, th basketball 
team is hopeful oC playing their 
last two home games in the 
gym.

additions will make it ade-

Coach Bob Wilson has a great deal to cheer about for the com1ng 
cross-country season. Win or lose, he feels 'that the school has 
finally come of ace, at least as far as his harriers are concerned. 

Most of last years athletes are returning to the 4.7 mile course 
with the major exception being distance-ace Lane Mason, who ~ 
returned to Cal Tech. 

"This may hurt us at first," said WilSon, "but we have plenty of 
good returnees and upcoming freshmen." Jim Haury, Cha.rlE)s Lind-
sey, am hopefully Mike Morales will allbebaek. Times of ineomlng 
fresbmen are quite good, and Wilson points out a 4.15 mller. 

Interest in the sport is way up. The team Is scheduled to run 10 
meets, with the highlight of the season the all-Cal meet on this 
campus. "We couldn't be more pleased," said Wilson. "Teams 
from UCLA, RiverSide, Santa Barbara, and the other UC campuses 
will compete:' The biggest rival right now is probably Cal-Western. 

There has been enough of a turn out that the squad wlll go with two 
full teams this year, a varsity and a "B" team. "Two full teams 
will travel with us to all the meets," Wilson stressed. 

The faCilities are in good sbape, with better drainage on the 
course (north of old Miramar Road). The course has always had 
excellent potential. In fact, the AAU held their Southern Cali-
fornia meet here last year. Wilson would now like to make a bid 
for the National meet, which would give the course and the school 
nation-wide attention.

Most of the foreign students 
are here for graduate work in 
all fields of study, especially 
physics and aerospace. But 
their number also includes so-
me undergraduates, whose cla-
sses are scheduled primarily 
at Revelle College. Afew.how-
ever, will be at new Muir Col-
lege. 

Speaking for the UIA, McAl-
lister welcomes these students 
to UCSD and urges them and 
other foreign students to join 
and particilllte in the club. 

these two groups, the UIA spOn-
sors activities including all stu-
dents. 

Some of last year'sactivities 
included beach parties for 
groups of Mexican qnd African 
students visiting U.C.S.D., and 
a day on campus for students 
with the San Diego high school 
foreign exchange program.

9 Students 
Named For 
Who's Who 

ine students from the ni-
versity of California at San 
Diego have rec ived mem r-
ship in th este med ranks of 
"Who's Who in American ni-
versiti sand Colleg s." 

Th selectionof suchstudent s 
from various institutions in 
America is mad by an on-
campus committ. At th 
UCSD campus th organization 
selecting th stud nts for thi~ 
honor is made up of students, 
faculty and staff. 

Students receiving the honor 
have exce lled in scholarship, 
citizenship, leadership, and 
promise. 

UCSD has chosen nine stu-
dents from its 3,100 to be 
honored: Ray Tice (Biology 
major, junior), Larry Baker 
(Biology, senior, first UCSD 
AS President), Marsha Penner 
(Philosophy, senior ), Richard 
Altenhoff (Biology, senior ), Roy 
Dimon (Nominated UCSD'sAth-
lete-of-the-Year), .John uber 
(Math, graduate student), Janet 
Albin (Math, senior ), Chrispin 
Hollinshead (AS Comptroller, 
helped to form AS), Roy Ver-
dery (Physics. iunior).

The second college's program 
of study is geared to more ex-
perimentation and independent 
study by stllrl~nts, since they 
can fulfill their breadth re-
quirements in so many different 
ways. 

Muir's curriculum, however, 
cannot b chosen cafeteria-
style. Most requirement s must 
be met by sequences of 3 to 6 
courses. Yet, after all breadth 
requirements have been met, 
and even if a sl'Jd nt has started 
a languag at UCSD, h will 
still have time for some elec-
tives. 

But Muir students will not 
have an easy curriculum be-
c lise of this fr edom of choice, 
.... arns Stewart. 

"Som students might b-
wilde r ed by th cha ll ng Muir 
oCf r s them. Th y would tell 
us, 'Yl)u' r th xperts; you 
know what the b st program 
ought to .' Thus Muir Coli ge 
is for those who are willing to 
use th ir own initiativ ." 

Un the oth r hand, a student 
may d cid to conc ntrate all 
of his tim in on fi~ld. "One 
stud nt I have talk d to," says 
Stewart, "wants to spend two 
y ars studying only mathe-
m tics. A !though I discou rage 
such a limit d program, there 
is nothing in the Muir academic 
setlemt: to prev nt such a pas-
sionate pursuit of on subject." 

John Muir Coil ge,ofcourse, 
is now a partner of Revelle 
Colleg in the ultimate make-up 
of UCSD. A stud nt of one 
college can now take certain 
courses in the other, such as 
Anthropology and the Nature oC 
Music. 

lf a student wants to transfer 
completely from one college to 
another, says Stewart, all that 
is necessary is "fulfillment of 
lower division requirements in 
the other college. But one may 
not take half of the Revelle 

atural Science sequence in 
hopes of getting the other half 
in an easier sequence at Muir. 
He will surely lose the benefit 
of a coherent course of study 
and, perhaps , credit in the other 
college's program." The goal of UIA, continues 

McAllister, is for a high de-
gree of ~ international under-
standing and activity based on 
communication between stu-
dents from other countries and 
Americans at the college and in 
the community.·

New Math 
Offered At Muir 
The creation of Muir College, 

accepting its first students this 
Fall, has made necessary the 
addition of two more sequences 
on th list of mathe matics cour-
ses. 

The first addition, the5 series 
essentially provides a review of 

. high school mathematics. Very -
basic calculus concepts are in-
cluded only in the last quarter of 
the sequence. 

As an alternative tt Muir stu-
dents, the 10 se ries of math cou-
rses is offered. This sequence 
consists of varied tOPICS in math 
not including calculu.;. 

Although these t'll 0 series 
may not be used for s tislactioll 
of the Revelle Collega math re-
quirement, Muir rec) izes th-
em as bona-fide COU! ses. 

Requirements fOI Revelle 
students are the sarr e this year 
as last. Only the ) or 2 will 
f1ll the bill. 

To meet the needs of an en-
larging department, eight as-
sistant professors and two vi-
siting professors have been we-
lcomed to the mathematicsstaff. 
Aside from adding two new se-
quences, the new profs have en-
abled the department to enlarg 
its scope of undergrad math -
mat1cs. Some of the topic r-
c1evtng greater breadth wlll be 
logic, oumerical analysis, com-
plex YU'iables, probability the-

of Language Program 
Th language program of 

UCSD will not provide r turning 
students with any gr eat sur-
prises this year. Despite this 
lack of change in the program 
itself, the language department, 
headed by Professl)r Newmark, 
intends to continually revalu-
ate its teaching methods. 

This intense scrutiny will 
help t I t.ngineer future pro-
grarn,> t1!cording to the per-
form 1 .I;e of the students them-
selves. Presently, the program 
is hea I Lng in two major direc-
tion" . 

The first aim of the language 
pro~J am is to achiev a high 
degre· "( "psychological real-
ism" ior the student. Dis-

cussjr,~ this problem of student 
en~rOilment, Professor New-
mark .1,l,nitc !l:lt, "It ' hard 
to mak·, .1 classroom anything 
but a classroom." 

The second main d sire of 
the department is to provide 
better ways (or the student to 
realize exactly what h must do 
to learn a language. 

To satisfy th se al ms, the 
department has institut d a 
compl te languag laboratory, 
tutorials led by nativ s in the 
respective languag s, and con-
ferences where grammar and 
linguistics are taught. 

The language courses them-
selves have sev ral distinct 
parts. The tutorials and th 
language lab ar d sign d to 
makp the student use th lan-

In practical situations. 

to increase the student's under-
standing o( the nature and tech-
niques of language. 

Starting this year the scripts 
used in language tutorials may 
be written by the students. If 
this is the decision of the de-
partment, it will increase the 
students ' freedom and partici-
pation in the program. 

For th future, several in-
teresting ideas are being for-
mulated. More economical and 
efficient video- tape machines 
are being designed to enable 
students to se and hear their 
foreign language spoken. Ex-
periments are now being made 
to determine whether the stu-
d nt learns faster in a group or 
by himself. ther experiments 
are providing information con-
cerning the necessity of stu-
dent partiCipation. 

The fusion of these ideas and 
experiments may lead eventu-
ally to th stud nt who is able 
to learn a foreign tongue en-
tirely in a language lab. 

Although any concr te evi-
dence of these ideas is sev ral 
y ars away, th languag de-
partment already has a small 
television studio wh re vid 0 -
taping may be don. 

Whil th mechanics of th 
language program will r main 
unchanged this year, th d-
partment's t aching aspirations 
will ke p moving ah d. ld aJly 
th program should be abl to 
teach stud nts who hav no 
interest to learn. Professor 

THOROUGHLY 
MODERN

An act of Congress deeded 
Camp Matthews, a Marine 
Corps rine r ange, to the Uni-
versity of California, San Diego 
on October 7, 1964. The land, 

~4~ acres adjacent to the main 
University property, was ac-
quired for use as a staging 
facility for each of the Uni-
versity's twelve colleges. 

The Marine buildings, quon-
s t huts included, will be class-
rooms, and research and ad-
ministrative offices for stu-
dents and faculty for two years 
while th physical plant of th ir 
resp ctiv coll ge is under con-
struction. Plans call for a new 
college ev r y three years. 

Mac A. Cason, Campus 
ArChil ct, estimates that the 
us of the land and Marin 
buildings has resulted in a 
savings of almost $3 million. 
The cost of remodeling was 
$6 .50 per square foot as opposed 
to th cost of approximately $40 
a ."quare Coot for new buildings 
such as those located on Revelle 
College. The facilities are of 
particular value because they

for the Prime Minister, who is 
here to meet with Peace Corps 
officials from Washington and 
Peace Corps trainees ~t UCSD. 

InVIted to the reception are

Thursday the Prime Minister 
will tour the Peace Corps 
training camp, which is located 
at Mataguay Reservation, be-

Hot Springs. He will talk to the 
100 new trainees, who will be 
sent to Lesotho after the 10-

Robert Messmer and Lloyd 

Konig, under Mac Cason, have 
directed the remodeling, which 
is scheduled for completion in 
October 1967. The project 
architect chose ' a (';oior and 
decorative scheme suitable for 
campus life. 

For the Quonset huts, Robert 
M ssmer adopted the semi-
circular shape of the huts and 
d veloped that theme in ev ry 
phase of land and building im-
provement. Windows anddoors 
of the quonset huts repeat the 
circular theme of the huts. The 
effect is reproduced in the land-
scaping, the ramps, the walk-
ways and even the wood detailing 
of th rain gutt rs. 

ew brick paving surrounds 
pines which have been trans-
planted and placed in the middle 
of a group of quonset huts, 
creating a campus mall. 

One hullding which might have 
been demolished because of its 
location on the sight oUhe UCSD 
School of Medicine was removed 
and taken in two parts to another 
location on the campus. The 
building is now the Student 
Health Center.

Some of the major works of 
the Twentieth century will be 
the (lhject of intensive scrutiny 
in freshman humanities courses 
this fall. 

There will be four freshman 
humanities classes on the Re-
velle campus. 

Dr. Crowne will be teaching 
the Subject A Humanities sec-
tions and Subject A for Muir. 

Dr. Moore, Professor of 
Philosophy, is also teaching 
freshman this faU. A large-
percentage of the students who 
had Dr. Moore last year were' 
very enthusiastic about his 
class and lectures. 

Dr. Moore's book list contains 
two works apiece by Freud, 
Shaw and Lenin. There are 
also works by Kafka, Malraux 
(Man's Fate), and F. Scott Fitz-
gerald (The Great Gatsby). 

Dr. Kirkby's reading list 
shows his concern with contem-
porary issues. It includes the 
autobiography of Malcolm X, 
Sheer's How the U. S. Got 
involved in Viet Nam and Shur-
mann's Politics of Escalation. 
Dr. Kirkby is an Assistant Pro-
fessor of Philosophy. Most of 
his former students feel that he 
is an interesting lecturer. 

Jack Behar, Ph.D., is an 
Assistant Professor of Ameri-
can Literature. Hi s reading
