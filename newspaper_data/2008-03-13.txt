Three months after orchestrating 
a bomb threat that forced a seven-
hour evacuation of the School of 
Medicine complex, a former UCSD 
employee awaits sentencing for the 
hoax after pleading guilty earlier 
this week.

Richard Sills Jr., who worked in 
the Leichtag Biomedical Research 
Building for seven months prior to 
the Dec. 5 bomb scare, could face 
up to five years in prison when he is 
sentenced by a federal court judge.

A senior administrator at UCSD’s nationally recognized Preuss 
School went on leave late last month, though university officials are 
denying any connection to the recent investigation into administra-
tive mismanagement and inappropriate grade changes.

Jamie Esperon, the charter school’s assistant dean of students, 
took leave from her position on Feb. 28. Though she did not provide 
an official reason for Esperon’s departure, UCSD spokeswoman 
Dolores Davies said it was not related to the university audit that 
implicated many senior administrators, including the school’s for-
mer principal, in the altering of students’ grades.

Davies said that employee privacy issues prevent her from 
discussing the terms of Esperon’s leave, including whether it was 
mandated or pursued voluntarily.

Since joining the school in 2003, Esperon served as a counselor 
for sixth through eighth graders and also presented information 
about Preuss to students at San Diego schools. She worked as part of 

Preuss Leadership
Takes Another Hit By Gina McGalliardStaff WriterWhen members of the theater and 

dance department posted a list of Spring 
Quarter’s approved student-run caba-
rets last week, they did not expect the 
backlash that it would ignite among the 
undergraduate student body. Of the six 
greenlighted cabarets, only three are 
directed by undergraduates — a figure 
that has motivated a group of students 
to petition the department chair to offer 
them more directorial opportunities.

In addition to its quarterly produc-
tion, the department also approves a 
number of entirely student-run caba-
rets. The department gives the approved 
cabarets a budget of $40 and allows 
student directors access to rehearsal 
and performance space, as well as stage 
equipment.

This quarter, approximately 25 caba-
rets were submitted for approval for the 
six available slots, according to depart-
ment Production Manager Michael 
Francis.

Francis and Facilities Manager Laura 
Manning selected the cabarets this year. 
He said that decisions are not made on 
the basis of a play’s artistic merit, but 

whether the department already pos-
sesses the necessary resources to facili-
tate the show.

The fact that some students held 
auditions before anyone knew which 
cabarets were going to be approved 
could have exacerbated disappointment  
with the selection process, Francis said.

With a large number of unapproved 
undergraduate cabarets, some students 
have speculated that department admin-

istrators deliberately rejected many of 
their proposals.

“Some people feel that this is the 
department reacting to people not 
auditioning for its production,” Sixth 
College senior Michael Kelly said. Kelly 
had already been cast in two cabarets 
not approved by the department. 

Because the department play was

The firm Soltek Pacific began construction of the new RIMAC Annex this month. The building will 
include a cafe with a “healthy living” theme, indoor and outdoor terraced seating and a conference room. 

By Reza Farazmand
Associate News Editor

Construction of RIMAC Annex, 
the university’s new 14,000 sq. ft., 
$10-million dining and retail facility, 
is underway this month. The build-
ing, funded entirely by student rec-
reational fees, will be be situated just 
north of RIMAC Arena and house 
a Peet’s Coffee, a cafe, a conference 
room and a convenience store, in 
addition to several outdoor seating 
areas.

University officials have expressed 
excitement about the Annex, calling 
the new facility a much-needed addi-
tion to the campus’ northern areas.

“We got a lot of support for the 
notion of having a facility for stu-
dents as kind of a central gathering 
spot on north campus, because it is 
so far away from the Price Center and 
the Student Center that this would 
be a good hub of student activity,” 
Sports Facilities Director Donald E. 
Chadwick said. “Sometimes there’s 
no better way to do that than with 
food.”

However, not everyone is satisfied 
with the project. Dana Dahlstrom, 
a former Athletics, Recreation and 
Sports Facilities Advisory Board stu-
dent representative, raised concerns 
over the alleged mishandling of stu-
dent fees linked to construction of 
the new facility. Dahlstrom said that 
the administration’s use of student 

recreational fees to fund the project 
was out of line, especially because the 
new building will contain no recre-
ational facilities.

“By the admission of adminis-
trators, the RIMAC Annex is not a 
recreational facility, and is instead 
intended to serve the new business 
school and residential facilities in 
north campus,” Dahlstrom said in an 
e-mail. “It is inappropriate to spend 
students’ recreational facility fees to 
construct or maintain such a build-
ing.”

Dahlstrom said that student input 
regarding the planning and design 
of the Annex was largely ignored by 

campus officials. He referred specifi-
cally to two surveys distributed last 
year by the A.S. Council and the 
Graduate Student Association that 
asked students to rank their priori-
ties for various proposed features 
of the Annex. Dahlstrom said that 
although the survey found a large 
student interest in new recreational 
facilities, the administration did little 
to accommodate these preferences. 

“I think [the administration’s] 
position from the beginning was that 
they didn’t see the point in asking 
students’ opinions,” Dahlstrom said.

Programmers seeking fiscal help

event planners say will grant them

UCSD’s most talked-about annual

with programmers planning to utilize 
new security measures and host more

be a significant amount. Programmers

iPOD WINNERS!

State’s Lt. Gov. Joins 
Students in Fee Protest 

Lt. Gov. John Garamendi par-
ticipated in a student demonstration 
on the steps of the state Capitol 
last week, protesting student fee 
increases and budget cuts that 
would adversely affect California’s 
public universities. 

The demonstration, which drew 
hundreds of college students, was 
organized and sponsored by the UC 
Students Association in response to 
the state financial plan outlined by 
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger earlier 
this year. 

“Over the last few years, UC and 
CSU student fees have nearly doubled 
— our students can’t afford it, and our 
state can’t afford to leave future gen-
erations out of California’s prosperity,” 
Garamendi said at the rally.

Garamendi, who has advocated 
increased transparency in execu-
tive compensation practices at 
California’s public universities as well 
as a staunch opponent of continually 
rising student fees, added that he 
will continue to fight the proposed 
fee increases.

“I have asked my fellow UC 
regents and CSU trustees to halt 
these increases, which amount to a 
hefty tax on students, and I will keep 
up this fight to ensure that California 
keeps its historical promise to put 
higher education within reach of 
every California student,” he said.

UC Student Regent Benjamin 
Allen expressed similar views.

“Six out of the past seven years, 
students have been asked to pay 
more, and this year’s budget propos-
al adds insult to injury with the pos-
sibility of bigger classes and fewer 

services,” Allen said. “It’s time that 
our leaders in Sacramento fund an 
education system that is worthy of 
California’s talented students.”

UC Alumni Honor 2008 
Legislators of the Year

The Alumni Associations of the 
University of California recently made 
their selections for 2008 Legislators 
of the Year, announcing that state 
Sen. Jack Scott (D-Pasadena) and 
Assemblyman John Laird (D-Santa 
Cruz) would receive the honor. 

“Both Sen. Scott and 
Assemblyman Laird have demon-
strated lifelong commitments to 
higher education and have been 
true friends of the University of 
California,” UC President Robert C. 
Dynes said in a statement. 

University officials said Laird, 
who graduated from UC Santa 
Cruz in 1972 and currently serves 
on the Assembly Committee on 
Budget and as vice chair of the 
Joint Legislative Budget Committee, 
received the honor for his commit-
ment to supporting the UC system’s 
principles of education, public ser-
vice, and innovation through his 
work in Sacramento and in his local 
community. 

“He’s been really terrific on 
funding for the UC system and for 
enrollment growth,” said Karen 
French, interim director of UC State 
Governmental Relations. 

Officials also lauded Scott for 
his support of the UC system while 
serving as chair of the Senate 
Education Committee and Budget 
Subcommittee on Education and 
former chair of the Assembly Budget 
Subcommittee on Education.

Outreach Finding a Space on Campus

By Diana Tith
Staff Writer

In the far end of the Student 
Affirmative Action Committee 
lounge sits a small office where a 
staff of 22 students coordinates out-
reach and retention programs that 
focus on promoting equal access to 
higher education.

In Spring Quarter 2007, 
the Promoting Understanding 
and Learning through Service 
and Education fee referendum 
was birthed after Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger proposed budget 
cuts that threatened systemwide 
outreach. When the referendum was 
put to a vote, 56 percent of voting 
students approved the increase of 
$7 per student to the A.S. Campus 
Activity Fee. 

The referendum increased 
funding for the Student Initiated 
Access Programs and Services, 
previously known as the Student 
Initiated Outreach and Recruitment 
Commission and the Academic 
Success Program. However, outreach 
services have taken several hits in 
state funding this year, with budget 
cuts forcing the elimination of sev-
eral services run by the California 
Student Opportunity and Access 
Program.

P.U.L.S.E. was also responsible for 
the creation of the Student Promoted 
Access Center for Education and 
Service. 

The newly created S.P.A.C.E.S. 
center aims to enact programs and 
activities that assist in undergraduate 
retention, graduation and matricula-
tion to graduate and professional 

Hefty Council Sacrifice Pleases Sun 
God, Shrinks Org Funding Pool

The financial health of next quarter’s Sun God festival took center stage at last night’s A.S. 
Council meeting. Councilmembers 
debated the community-building 
merits of the festival and the appro-
priateness of allocating more funding 
for the event instead of other cash-
strapped student organizations. 

Up for consideration was a 
$30,000 funding bill to help cover 
the costs of revamping and expand-
ing this year’s festival. Associate Vice 
President of Programming Kevin 
Highland attended the meeting to 
explain how the council’s decision 
would affect the event.

Most of the 
extra money was 
needed to cover 
a reserve fund 
that helps insure 
against any equip-
ment damage 
resulting from 
the festival. The 
reserve amount was calculated as 5 
percent of the festival’s $440,000 price 
tag, or $22,000.

Highland said that the remaining 
$8,000 was needed to fund a new 
wristband admission system that will 
allow the students to re-enter the fes-
tival throughout the day. 

He warned that cuts were already 
made in formulating the request and 
that not allocating the full $30,000 
would force a reduction in the scale 
of the festival.

Sixth College Senator John 
Cressey said that approving the 
request would leave the council with 
$14,000 to fund student organizations 
next fall, a far cry from the $75,000 
that was granted to organizations for 
spring quarter. 

“So $14,000 for an entire quarter 
is ridiculous [and] frightening,” he 
said. “As much as we love Sun God, 

there are other things we do here at 
council. This isn’t a vote against Sun 
God. It’s a vote for other things.”

Several councilmembers sup-
ported the finance bill because of 
the festival’s unmatched campuswide 
appeal and downplayed the poten-
tial consequences of less funding for 
organizations.

“Sun God is the only thing that 
people think of when they think of 
A.S.,” Associate Vice President of 
Student Advocacy Neetu Balram 
said. “For us not to spend this will 
disappoint the vast majority of people 
on this campus … They will kill us. 
If we have the ability to pay them 

the $30,000 to do 
what they do best 
I think we should 
do it.”

The break 
from arguments 
came when the 
council when 
Vice President of 

Finance and Resources Sarah Chang 
said that previously underutilized 
funding from other sources could be 
used to fund student organizations in 
the fall. The calls for fiscal responsi-
bility died off and the council passed 
the bill to its own applause.

The council quickly transitioned 
into its next extended discussion when 
All-Campus Senator Naasir Lakhani 
reported that the Housing and Dining 
Services Advisory Committee recent-
ly responded warmly to a proposal to 
increase the “mandatory buy” for stu-
dents in residence halls from $2,100 
to $2,900. 

The discourse lost the divisiveness 
present during the funding debate 
as councilmembers quickly formed 
a consensus against the proposal. 
Apparently the mediocrity of dining 
hall food possesses a unifying power 
even greater than that of Sun God.

Business tried to encourage students to par-

ticipate,” Mann said. “We also tried 
to show the kind of UCSD that we 
know, which is not just science and 
engineering buildings.”

The tours, therefore, took 
prospective students to places 
such as the Lesbian Gay Bisexual 
Transgender Resource Center, the 
Women’s Center and other facilities 
that Mann said are often neglected 
in official campus tours. The tours 
not only serve as an outreach mech-
anism, but also help to encourage 
retention by enlisting UCSD student 
volunteers. 

According to Mann, the volun-
teers are able to give back to the 
community and become a part of the

community.

a three-person team that included Phil 
Ensberg, the school’s senior counselor, 
who returned from paid leave following 
the audit’s release in December. Davies 
said it would be premature to speculate 
when Esperon may return to work.

The school’s leaders are currently 
formulating a plan to resolve any prac-
tical issues created by Esperon’s depar-
ture.

“[Acting Principal] Scott Barton is 
working with his administrative team 
to ensure that all counseling needs are 
filled,” Davies said.

Although university officials 
reserved the right to pursue further 
disciplinary actions against employees 
after the audit’s release, none are cur-
rently planned, she added.

Preuss Board of Directors Chair 
Susan Kirkpatrick declined to com-
ment. However, board member Hugh 
“Bud” Mehan said he looked into the 
circumstances of the incident and found 
they had no correlation to the audit.

“This is a matter that has nothing 
to do with the board,” said Mehan, who 
also serves as director of UCSD’s Center 
for Research on Educational Equity, 
Assessment and Teaching Excellence. 
“It’s a matter of an entirely different 
sort.”

Per the audit’s recommendations, 
UCSD’s Vice Chancellor of Resource 
Management and Planning Gary C. 
Matthews recently hired MGT of 
America, an external consulting firm, 
to independently review the school’s 
operations. 

Davies said the review will like-
ly be completed within three to four

a musical theater production, not 
as many people tried out for it as 
usual, Kelly said.

However, department Chair 
Charlie Oates denied that the 
department was attempting to pun-
ish undergraduates.

“There was simply more people 
than there were spaces for,” he said. 
“That has nothing to do with it. I’m 
sorry if somebody has that impres-
sion, but that’s the furthest thing 
from my mind as an explanation.”

Oates said that the surplus of 
graduate cabarets for Spring Quarter 
is probably due to a higher number 
than usual of graduate applicants 
than usual. 

During the 2007-08 academic 
year, there were a total of 10 under-
graduate cabarets to four graduate 
cabarets. The year prior, under-
graduate cabarets outnumbered 
their graduate counterparts 13 to 
five.

Additionally, undergraduates 
are often given performance oppor-
tunities in graduate productions, 
Oates said.

Earl Warren College senior 
Raymond Castelan, an undergrad-
uate adviser for the department, 
said that Fall and Winter Quarters 
usually have more slots for under-
graduate cabarets because Spring 
Quarter is more graduate-heavy.

“In reality, nothing was taken 
away, because nothing was ever 
guaranteed,” he said. 

Castelan said he doubted the 

decision was punitive, because the 
people who select the cabarets for 
approval are staff, not faculty, and 
do not have an interest in who tries 
out for the department play. 

Graduate students used to per-
form the cabaret selection, Castelan 
said, but the practice was discontin-
ued because some graduate students 
showed favoritism toward certain 

undergraduates. 
However, Castalan said that the 

students whose cabarets were not 
chosen are finding other venues for 
their work.

Kelly said the director of one of 
his cabarets is currently scouting 
other on-campus locations to per-
form the play, while the other was 
canceled.

Revelle College junior Madeleine 
Allen said that some students were 
upset because the nature of the 
selection — with half of the chosen 
plays being directed by graduate 
students — created the impression 

that the department was disregard-
ing its undergraduates.

According to Allen, the depart-
ment did not approve the full-
length show she was directing due 
to high production costs. However, 
she does not believe that the depart-
ment’s actions were punitive.

Instead, she cited a lack of com-
munication within the department 
as the reason for the discord. For 
instance, during a recent town hall 
meeting at which performance 
opportunities for undergradu-
ates were discussed, Francis and 
Manning were not present.

“The two people who made the 
decision are completely disconnect-
ed from the situation,” Allen said.

Castelan, however, said he believes 
that the department communicates 
well internally, but people have to 
know where to find the information.

John Muir College junior Kendra 
Miller, who was also directing a 
rejected cabaret, agreed that better 
communication is needed within 
the theater department.

She said that she feels there will 
also be positive outcomes of the 
controversy, because it demonstrates 
students’ passion for cabarets.

“Ultimately, I think a lot of good 
will come from this, because it 
shows the department how much 
energy and interest there are in 
people wanting to practice their 
art,” she said.

The newly formed center has 

progressed soundly despite the lack 
of a professional staff. As a stu-
dent-led organization, the staff con-
sists of full-time students who work 
between 15 and 20 hours per week 
and who are members of other orga-
nizations. 

“It’s like running a $300,000 non-
profit,” Mann said. 

With this funding boost, which 
is shared with SIAPS and A.S.P., 
the S.P.A.C.E.S. co-directors hope to 
further their programs and goals to 
serve UCSD students and the greater 
San Diego community. 

S.P.A.C.E.S. is looking into 
employing two full-time staff mem-
bers to work under the supervision 
of Director of A.S. Administration 
Lauren Weiner.

Furthermore, the staff ’s main 
focus would be on S.P.A.C.E.S. pro-
grams, the operation and manage-
ment of the center and its student 
employees. 

The S.P.A.C.E.S. staff will soon 
receive a new office as part of the 
Price Center expansion, where its 
members will continue their efforts 
outside of the SAAC lounge.

THURSDAY, MARCH 13, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN NEWS  9

val — hosted this year on May 16 
— but their new plans for Sun God 
inflated operational costs, according to 
Festivals Coordinator Garrett Berg.

This year’s festival will debut an 
almost completely renovated festival. 
The overhaul marks programmers’ 
efforts to meet demands from admin-
istrators that they focus on safety and 
community issues. Led by Associate Vice 
Programming of Programming Kevin 
Highland, the council’s programming 
department commissioned an exten-
sive evaluation of the festival, gathering 
complaints and suggestions from sev-
eral administrative departments. Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs Penny 
Rue expressed worry over student safety 
after the report identified a spike in the 
number of arrests and citations at last 
year’s festival. Rue said that the festival 
lacked a concrete mission statement 
and that programmers should seek a 
“community-building character” for the 
festival. 

After the report’s release last 
October, programmers have been 
working with administrators to reform 
many aspects of the festival. Berg 
said that negotiations with the police 
department have produced a “great 
relationship.” While UCSD Police 
Chief Orville King was initially con-
cerned about the event’s traditionally 
unsafe environment, he has found its 
“new format … quite creative.”

A.S. councilmembers had protest-
ed the strong presence of undercover 
officers, saying that it did nothing to 
deter students from unsafe behavior and 
instead promoted a distastefully authori-
tative culture. Rue herself said she was 
irked by the logic of undercover officers, 
saying at a council meeting earlier this 
year that “[undercover officers] don’t 
seem like the way we want to police our 
students during the festival.”

This year’s approach to securi-

“They didn’t understand why we 
wanted to [consult the survey]. They 
basically said, ‘Look, we’ve already 
decided what’s going in the building, 
so this isn’t an issue that we want stu-
dent input on.’ That’s basically what 
they told us when we proposed to 
take the vote.”

Responding to the allegations, 
Chadwick said that the administra-
tion had taken the surveys into con-
sideration, going so far as to change 
aspects of the internal design of the 
Annex in response to the preferences 
indicated by students’ answers.

“The survey was a very beneficial 
instrument and provided tremen-
dous feedback on student interests,” 
Chadwick said. “The results helped to 
shape the desired theme and environ-
ment for the Annex.”

In defense of the administration’s 
usage of student recreational fees to fund 
the Annex, Chadwick said that many 
college campuses across the country are 
undertaking similar measures.

“Within the last few years there’s 
been kind of a melding almost of stu-
dent union and recreational facilities 
throughout the country,” Chadwick 
said. “This is happening more and 
more as campuses evolve over time. 
In other words, you’re finding in rec 
centers they’re combining a lot of 
conference rooms and retail facili-
ties when they’re building the new 
facilities. And similarly, the student 
unions are more frequently incor-
porating components that had more 
traditionally been in rec centers, like 
cardio centers and workout areas.”

The project is slated for comple-
tion by spring 2009.

ty will substitute local undercover 
officers with uniformed officers 
from other campuses, Berg said. 
Programmers wanted to utilize “like-
minded” officers familiar with col-
lege-age students; however, such a 
workforce costs more, Berg said, 
which forced programmers to request 
higher levels of funding.

Programmers are negotiating with 
Rue’s office to “underwrite the costs of 
the new security measures,” Berg said. 

The programming department is 
also dedicating a staff solely to garner 
corporate sponsorships.

Chang said that the $30,000 allo-
cated from the council’s general fund to 
the festival represented “the most that 
the council could give.” Berg said that he 
had originally requested about double 
that amount, but the figure was pared 
down before the council’s approval.  

At the meeting, several council-
members voiced opposition to grant-
ing more funds to the festival, which 
currently manages a budget of slightly 
over $400,000.

“I represent 10 student organiza-
tions that continuously get less than 
they request,” Interfraternity Council 
Representative Luke Pulaski said. “I 
don’t know where a council that insists 
it’s on the side of student organizations 
of all sorts can justify spending this 
money. I love Sun God, but we need to 
make the right decision.”

Vice President of Student Life and 
A.S. presidential candidate Donna 
Bean said that the festival was a cen-
terpiece around which several parties 
that usually disagree with each other 
could gather.

Berg said that the allocation offers 
breathing space for the department, 
which will still try to be as cost effec-
tive as possible.

Sills, 54, pleaded guilty to one 
count of making threats involving 
animal enterprises, and will appear 
before U.S. District Judge Larry 
Burns on June 16. 

According to an indictment 
issued by the San Diego U.S. 
Attorney’s office, Sills was initially 
charged with three counts of pro-
viding false information and hoaxes 
as well as two counts of making 
telephoned bomb threats. 

He was arrested on Jan. 4 by 
members of 
the FBI’s Joint 
Terrorism Task 
Force, though a 
brief treatment 
at Alvarado 
Hospital in 
East County 
delayed his 
a r r a i g n m e n t 
until Jan. 14.

The indict-
ment alleges 
that Si l ls 
threatened to 
detonate mul-
tiple remote-
controlled explosives in six campus 
buildings if all animals housed in 
campus research facilities were not 
released. 

A letter sent to the UCSD 
Police Department claimed that 
the Animal Liberation Front, an 
animal-rights activist group that 
has accepted responsibility for 
other threats against University of 
California laboratories, coordinated 
the attack.

“This will be a 9/11 event for the 
raising of awareness of what you 
and institutions like you are doing 
to these defensles [sic] sentiant [sic] 
beings,” the letter read.

Leichtag at 10:26 a.m. on Dec. 5, and 
the entire School of Medicine com-
plex was cleared out by members of 
the Metro-Arson Strike Team.

Members of the North American 
Animal Liberation Press Office, a 
group that advocates animal-rights 
reform and handles media requests for 
ALF, could not confirm whether Sills 
was a member of the organization.

“I never heard a word from this 
guy, or from anybody that knew any-
thing about it,” ALPO spokesman 

Jerry Vlasak said. 
“We don’t have 
any independent 
confirmation that 
he really was with 
the ALF.”

ALPO, which 
Vlasak called an 
“above-ground” 
o r g a n i z a t i o n , 
does not know 
the identities of 
ALF members.

The FBI arrest-
ed former UCSD 
employee Timothy 
Kalka three days 

after the hoax, but dismissed all 
charges against him on Jan. 4.

The UC Board of Regents is 
currently seeking an injunction 
against ALF, along with two other 
animal-rights organizations, due to 
the groups’ alleged harassment of 
professors and researchers working 
with animal subjects. 

Last month, the husband of a UC 
Santa Cruz biology professor was 
attacked in the couple’s home just 
weeks after the words “murderer” 
and “torturer” were chalked on the 
sidewalk in front of their residence.

OPINION
THURSDAY, MARCH 13, 2008THURSDAY, MARCH 13, 2008

EDITORIALS

The views expressed herein do not necessarily represent the opinions of the UCSD Guardian, the University of California or Associated Students.the University of California or Associated Students.t

Looking at this year’s upcom-ing A.S. elections, one mes-sage seems to stand out above 
all the others: Despite their best 
efforts, councilmembers are adept 
at creatively thwarting themselves.

Earlier this year, the council 
progressively decided to implement 
instant runoff voting in future elec-
tions, designed to ensure that the 
winning candidate has the broadest 
base of voter support. However, this 
year’s much-anticipated candidate 
announcements provided an inter-
esting setback for IRV advocates — 
hopefuls for the top four executive 
positions, along with many other 
key offices, are running unopposed. 
In fact, IRV will only be utilized for 
one race in Revelle College.

Coming on the heels of last year’s 
contentious four-way battle for the 
A.S. presidency, IRV’s effective 
neutralization prompts the obvious 
question: What happened?

The answer, it appears, lies in 
the perpetually ballooning power 
of the Student Voice! slate, which 
captured 35 positions to opponent 
SHOCK!’s 12 in last year’s council 
race. Though SV! members barely 
beat out their competitors in sev-
eral key offices — including the 
hard-sought presidency — they 
made quick work of dispatching 
their potential competition down 
the road.

When SHOCK! frontman and 
presidential runner-up Dan Palay 
lost the election to SV!’s Marco 
Murillo, he began a secondary cam-
paign for the title of associate vice 
president of athletic relations. A 
longtime Triton Tide supporter who 
helped spearhead last year’s under-
graduate athletics fee referendum, 

Palay — who even served as chair 
of the Athletics, Recreation and 
Sports Facilities Advisory Board 
— received a shock of his own 
when Vice President of Student Life 
Donna Bean passed him up for the 
position, instead granting it to new-
comer Stephanie Chang.

Though she denied that the 
choice was politically motivated, 
the savvy Bean — now the only 
candidate for A.S. president — dealt 
a crippling blow to what was left of 
SHOCK!. Palay, an Earl Warren 
College senior, had few other 
opportunities to pursue a cabinet 
position and was forced to lay down 
his campaign torch. Intentional 
or not, the decision eliminated a 
potential source of dissent, and all 
but ensured her slate’s dominance 
over council matters this year.

Even during council meetings, 
where controversy oftentimes rears 
its ugly head, SV! has managed to 
keep relative order. In comparison 
to the last few years, this group 
has more united meetings and far 
less contention than its predeces-
sors encountered. When arguments 
do occur, they are usually short-
lived and initiated by the same few 
senators. Simply put, SV! is a force 
to be reckoned with, and given its 
massive support base — it might be 
easier to join them rather than to 
try and beat them.

It is not surprising, therefore, 
that none of Palay’s fellow slate 
members took up the charge to 
reinvent SHOCK! this year. Even 
All-Campus Senator Meghan Clair, 
one of Palay’s most vocal allies, is 
pursuing re-election under the SV! 
umbrella. It’s clear that anyone who 
has been paying attention to recent 

council politics knows where the 
chips are likely to fall.

While SV! members will likely 
have reason to celebrate another 
year of control, there exists a small 
contingent of independent candi-
dates that they would be remiss to 
underestimate. Ten of the 35 can-
didates are not affiliated with any 
slate, which Earl Warren College 
senior and former presidential can-
didate Michael Hirshman demon-
strated is hardly a reason to throw 
in the towel; as a council new-
comer, Hirshman managed to cap-
ture 1,163 votes in the last election 
and came in a close third place to 
veterans Murillo and Palay, both of 
whom were backed by the support 
of their respective slates.

Any independent candidate is 
going to face an uphill battle, espe-
cially against the Goliath that is SV!. 
In the spirit of IRV, however, this 
board can only hope that the dearth 
of competition will not make these 
races into foregone conclusions.

In light of continual funding cuts to San Diego outreach pro-grams — most recently affecting 
the California Student Opportunity 
and Access Program — it’s refresh-
ing to see students picking up the 
slack. 

Last year’s Promoting 
Understanding and Learning 
through Service and Education 
referendum bundled the Academic 
Success Program and the 
Student Initiated Outreach and 
Recruitment Commission into the 
Student Promoted Access Center 
for Education and Service, and 
together, the three programs are 
largely supported by student fees. 
The referendum added $7 — $5 of 
which goes to the programs while 
the remaining $2 is marked for 
financial aid — to the then-$21 
quarterly campus activity fee. 

The students involved with 
S.P.A.C.E.S. have continued to sup-

port the two previously established 
programs all year in addition to 
working on a number of new ini-
tiatives. The program hosts diver-
sity-themed campus tours, sends 
delegates to high school outreach 
conferences and is setting up its 
own newsletter — all this in just 
two quarters. 

S.P.A.C.E.S. is focused on reach-
ing out to underrepresented high 
school and community college stu-
dents in order to provide them with 
important information about how 
to apply to and succeed in col-
lege. The center is also working on 
a variety of programs to increase 
retention and graduation rates and 
assist with the transition into grad-
uate and professional schools.

All of the S.P.A.C.E.S. projects 
are student led, which is even more 
exciting than the excellent work it 
has already completed. Outreach 
and retention are vital to California’s 

future, though government authori-
ties and lawmakers have consis-
tently dropped the ball in funding 
them. The students involved with 
S.P.A.C.E.S. deserve great applause 
for all their work to help future 

UCSD students. 
It’s great to see the student-

led initiative thriving, and equally 
excellent that the P.U.L.S.E. refer-
endum proved to be money well 
spent.

Well, it’s that time again. That sleepless, over-caf-feinated, pajama-pants-
during-the-day, primal-screaming 
time of the quarter: finals week. 
And if three years of working at an 
on-campus convenience store has 
taught me anything, it’s that dur-
ing finals week students want blue-
books, cigarettes and energy drinks 
— the faster the better, and without 
any small talk please.

But why so suddenly sour, Tritons? 
Finals week may mean painstaking 
all-day library sessions followed by 
exhausting all-night cram time, but 
consider the positives.

1. Fewer Responsibilities. There 
aren’t regular class periods during 
finals week, which means you only 
have to show up to class for about 
four chunks of time. Additionally, 
if you work, most employers are 
pretty cool about adjusting to your 
finals-week schedule. Because you 
have less to do, you can be especially 
selfish with your time. Basically, 
you get the luxury to do whatever 
you want. 

If you have a final on Monday, but 
none on Tuesday or Wednesday, you 
have the freedom to sleep in until 
2 p.m. on Tuesday, then spend the 
afternoon at one of the oh-so-nearby 
beaches. And once you’re done with 
a particularly dreadful exam, it’s easy 
to forget your sorrows — no matter 
what day you finish finals, there is 
always a party to be found, debauch-
ery to be had or inebriation to be 
enjoyed with other students in your 
same position.

2. Easy Excuse. And even if you 
still have some responsibilities that 
aren’t confined to scheduling, finals 
week gives you the perfect excuse 
to avoid them for a while. It’s like 
a get-out-of-jail-free card for life. 
Roommate annoying you to wash 
the dishes? Sorry, I have to study 
right now. Awkward acquaintance 
pestering you to have lunch? Sorry,

ging you to hurry home for spring 
break? Sorry mom, I miss you too, 
but I really have to study right now.

Stealing

LOCAL NEWS  — As she finally 
emerges from winter’s temporar-
ily imposed hibernation, and as San 
Diego begins to live up to its stel-
lar weather reputation, UCSD senior 
Anna Kim heads back to the beach. 
Contrary to popular belief, the typi-
cal UCSD student surfs more than 
just the Internet. Living on campus, 
the 15-minute walk is a piece of
cake, but driving to La Jolla Shores 
is a whole different story. There’s 
the 10-minute drive and then the 

time spent perusing the perpetually 
packed parking lot and surrounding 
neighborhood. Furthermore, Kim’s 
part-time hostess job at Jack’s La Jolla 
in downtown is just as problematic 
on the parking front.

The proposal for metered park-
ing in downtown La Jolla and La 
Jolla Shores, which would make La 
Jolla the first coastal community in 
San Diego County to require fees 
for parking, has been a hot topic 
since November of last year. For stu-
dents like Kim, who already experi-
ence parking problems on campus, 
in downtown La Jolla and at La Jolla 

Shores, the addition of meters to 
this already unsolvable equation is 
laughable. 

The La Jolla Community Parking 
District Advisory Board initiated a 
preliminary proposal last September. 
This volunteer board was created in 
2005 by the business improvement 
district of La Jolla, which claimed that 
increased business revenue in La Jolla 
could be realized by addressing esca-
lating parking problems. Problems 
included insufficient customer park-
ing, a loose time-limit system abused 
by employees outsmarting the grade 
school-level chalk system and no fis-

cal support from the San Diego City 
Council. Actually, if the board’s poli-
cy is implemented, San Diego would 
be falling in line with the precedent 
set forth by most Southern California 
coastal cities.

Have no fear, San Diego — the 
prodigal beach bum city is here. 
Several San Diegans raided the La 
Jolla Community Parking District 
Advisory Board in protest during the 
November meeting when they had 
predicted they’d submit a proposal 
to SDCC. A fire marshal had to pre-
maturely end negotiations when a 
crowd of hundreds sardined the 90-

person maximum occupancy room. 
Since then, the idea of metered beach 
parking was abandoned because of 
the negative backlash from commu-
nity members during negotiations in 
December and January. 

While we’ve fortunately dodged the 
$3 dent in our wallet for an afternoon 
at the shores, the board has focused 
on implementing a one-year trial of 
metered parking in the central retail 
district around Prospect Street. This 
district, called “the Village,” includes a 
majority of downtown La Jolla, a hot-

spot for college employees in the fine 
dining and retail industries. The plan 
would offer no alternative parking to 
the village’s workers, leaving behind 
thousands of people like Kim, who 
already leaves from La Jolla 30 min-
utes before her work shifts to avoid 
traffic and ensure parking. 

Think this measure will relieve 
the area of its already jam-packed 
streets come weekday afternoons? 
Think again. Most people who jour-
ney to Prospect Street in hopes of an 
overpriced meal and utter bourgeoi-
sie boredom know the slow crawl 
down Torrey Pines Road isn’t the 
most enjoyable trip. Once you arrive, 
may speed be with you in a no holds 
barred competition for scattered 
open spots. The additional inconve-
nience of getting to a parking kiosk 
and paying via cash or credit seems 
nonsensical. Installation of each 
kiosk would cost about $7,000, and 
there’s the preposterous idea of keep-
ing non-aesthetically pleasing meters 
when there could be Visa-compatible 
kiosks in the future.

So why do they feel that this pro-
posal is essential to the well being 
of La Jolla, and who are they? Enter 
the fiscally minded proponent 
for Promote La Jolla, the business 
improvement district that created the 
La Jolla Community Parking District 
advisory board in 2005. One questions 
the incentive for these crisp-business-
suit donning paid-parking support-
ers, aspiring to open a parking lot in 
the future. The singular purpose of 
improving “parking conditions” and 
helping businesses has been criticized 
heavily as being inaccurate in regards 
to the community’s needs. Slanting 
this one-year trial as an unbiased 
community improvement effort has 
been unsuccessful, especially when 
affluent business owners are spear-
heading the cause.

The board’s platform has been 
rigorously questioned as the con-

ception of these paid parking kiosks 
becomes a more viable reality. In a 
letter addressed to the La Jolla Light
editor on Feb. 29, the owner of a 
small retail store in “the Village” pro-
tested the board’s accusations that 
small businesses oppose community 
advancement. Claims have been made 
against these smaller businesses for 
allowing their employees to crowd 
out the time-limit spots, decreasing 
the space available for customers. On 
that basis, the larger business owners 
accuse them of blatant acts against 
community standards, and that kiosk-

ed parking would deter these crimes 
against the business community. The 
owner highlights the fact that parking 
permits for some of her employees are 
issued by Promote La Jolla, and the 
rest find far off residential parking, 
a practice in place since the store’s 
opening. Apparently, these “dirty” 
tactics falsify the situation, presenting 
no credible evidence to support their 
statements. This reliance on sweeping 
allegations by the board’s members  
produces questions over the actual 
incentives of these owners.

In fact, current allegations by 
attorneys Karl ZoBell and Steve 
Haskins have brought the board’s 
legitimacy into question. It’s the David 
and Goliath of the La Jolla parking 
industry, with the underdog — small 
businesses — pitted against the larg-
er corporations who have possible 

vested interests. The initial chairman 
of the board, Peter Wagener, even 
stepped down in December because 
of the controversy surrounding the 
project conflict of interest allegations. 
Suspicions of conflicts of interest, 
initially prompted by letters written 
by Haskins, have been brought up at 
SDCC last week. If results prove the 
advisory board’s illegitimate mem-
bership, then the entire idea of park-
ing kiosks could be discredited. The 
advocates against metered parking 
have organized through the Web site,
www.nopaidparking.org, and are con-www.nopaidparking.org, and are con-www.nopaidparking.org
tinuously rallying in protest during 
these proceedings.

One small victory for the people, 
due to the idiocy of LJCPD board 
in keeping incentives discrete, is not 
something to rejoice. As of late, coun-
terparts in Pacific Beach took a liking 
to La Jolla’s approach and proposed 
a similar plan, from the outside San 
Diego business firm Walker. The 
business improvement associations 
(Discover PB being one of many) in 
Pacific Beach are jumping on the rev-
enue-building bandwagon, and hop-
ing the disputes of the La Jolla park-
ing advisory board will aid them in 
achieving their own corporate wants. 
Though this group said the funds 
will funnel into the cities’ mainte-
nance directly (45 percent at that), 
the everyday beachgoer remains 
unappeased. All skeptics perceive a 
reality where the government cannot 
be trusted, and the capitalist society 
will benefit its major capitalist players 
the most. 

Sure, fun doesn’t cost a dime, but 
implementing new parking meters 
for San Diego’s most enviable asset 
will set the market price for fun at 
$3 an hour. In an increasingly costly 
world, enjoying a wallet-friendly day 
at the beach is a luxury that may 
become less and less realistic.

Accusations of Student Org 
‘Double-Dipping’ Misplaced
Dear Editor,

I read your “Council Sidesteps 
Allegations of Double-Dipping, 
Senator Snuggling” article and 
wanted to make a few comments as 
a former vice president.

The council has no place in 
accusing an organization of “dou-
ble-dipping” in A.S. Council line 
items.  Let me explain:

The A.S. Council routinely for-
gets that it allocates money toward 
student organization events, and not 
student organizations.

The weekly/quarterly funding 
process is merely a tool that allows 
the vice president of finance and 
resources to best gauge the percent-
age of cuts necessary to ensure a 
fair financing structure. If there’s 
leftover money, then it should go 
back to a student organization event 
rather than be a contribution to next 
year’s council, or, worse yet, be real-
located to fund more A.S. Council 
pet projects (and usually, funded 
to the full, while student orgs are 
encouraged to fundraise).

The A.S. Council made the right 
decision to fund the Movimiento 
Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan and 
Muslim Student Association event.  
The rules workaround was unnec-
essary. In fact, the organizations 
should be reimbursed any amount 
that they were cut, if they were.

And orgs hitting up senators for 
more money?  Why not?  It’s their
money. I think they have the right 
to request it for however they’d like 
to see it spent.

The VP of finance and resources 
will give sound financial reasoning 
to invest or not invest in an event 
made outside the regular funding 
deadlines. This year you guys have 

the best one yet, so ask!
Money questions need money 

answers, not a trip to Robert’s Rules 
of Order.

Just my two cents.

Zoo Animal Exploitation, 
Disregard Rampant in GizaRampant in GizaRampant
Dear Editor,

 I was very disappointed with 
your March 9 article, “San Diegans 
Shocked by Circus at Giza Zoo.” As 
someone who is currently planning 
a trip to Egypt this spring, I can 
confidently say that I will not be 
visiting the Giza Zoo or any other 
location where animals are taken 
out of their natural habitats only 
to serve as cheap entertainment for 
paying customers. 

While their enclosures may seem 
spacious to us, it’s important to 
remember that elephants and other 
animals normally roam up to 50 
miles per day in the wild. Contrast 
that with the space measured by the 
square foot they allow animals to 
live their lives in the zoo, and there 
is simply no justification for such 
tight confinement. 

Regardless of whether animals 
are being slaughtered for food, or 
exploited for entertainment in the 
circus, any time that animals are 
treated as objects for our amuse-
ment, they suffer immensely. 

Zoos teach children that it is 
acceptable to capture wild animals 
(often by killing their mothers), sep-
arate them from their families and 
homes and confine them to small 
cages. This is certainly not the kind 
of lesson a person of any age should 
be taught.

If we are to be a civilized society, 
it is imperative that we stop viewing 
and disregarding animals as if they 
were inanimate objects, and start 
respecting the fact that they have 
needs. 

Being killed for our food and 
clothing or being held captive for 
entertainment value is no way to 
live, and we have an obligation to 
hold ourselves to a higher standard.

help animals in your daily life, visit

B.O.A.R.S. Proposal Must Be 
Adopted With Amendments
Dear Editor,

The UC-wide faculty committee 
Board of Admissions and Relations 
with Schools has proposed a new 
admissions policy that includes 
eliminating the SAT II subject test 
requirement and the rigid use of 
other criteria to determine who is 
UC-eligible. If passed and correct-
ly implemented, it would increase 
the opportunities of Latino, black, 
American Indian, Filipino, rural 
and low-income students of all races 
to attend a UC school. The UC 
faculty and regents must adopt this 
proposal.

The UC system has grown increas-
ingly segregated since Proposition 
209, California’s affirmative action 
ban, passed. In 2007, UCSD’s fresh-
man class was only 16.4 percent 
Latino, black and American Indian, 
while these groups comprise 43.7 
percent of California’s high school 
graduates.

The B.O.A.R.S. proposal would 
allow UC campuses to reverse this. 

The proposal is modest, reasonable 
and long overdue. It would replace 
the university’s mechanical eligibil-
ity formula, which uses academi-
cally unsound criteria to automati-
cally disqualify thousands of stu-
dents, a disproportionate number 
of whom are underrepresented or 
low-income.

The university’s own studies 
reveal that the SAT II (and the SAT 
I) does not correlate with college 
success and completion rates. 

In California, 62 percent of 
Latino and 65 percent of black high 
school graduates who complete the 
university’s “a-g” requirements do 
not take the SAT II. This is due to 
the lack of counselors in segregated, 
under-resourced schools and racial 
stereotyping from counselors who 
do not prepare students properly. 
This arbitrary and discriminatory 
barrier must be removed.

The B.O.A.R.S. proposal would 
allow the system to consider stu-
dents who fall short of the “a-g” 
requirements. Currently, 45 percent 
of California’s high schools don’t 
offer enough “a-g” classes for all 
students to meet the requirement. 
Disproportionately, the schools that 
don’t offer these classes are major-
ity Latino and/or black. Punishing 
students in segregated schools who 
do not meet these requirements is 
racist and unfair.

The B.O.A.R.S.  proposal should 
be adopted, but with two important 
amendments. First, the proposal 
currently eliminates the guarantee 
of admission to the top 12.5 percent 
of California’s high school graduates. 
It must be amended to restore this, 
both to prevent any counter posi-
tion of an increase in underrepre-
sented minority student enrollment 
to this guarantee, and because the 
guarantee is democratic, benefitting 
all California students, including its 

rapidly increasing Latino student 
population.

Second, the proposal would more 
likely achieve substantial increases 
in underrepresented student enroll-
ment if it were amended to elimi-
nate the use of the SAT I. Numerous 
studies have been conducted on 
the racist and economic bias of the 
SAT. The demand for eliminating 
the SAT I has been raised in the UC 
system for many years — including 
by former UC President Richard 
Atkinson, the ASUC and the UC 
Latino Eligibility Task Force.

The SAT and other standardized 
tests do not measure intellectual 
ability or potential. They stigmatize 
minority and poor students while 
giving an unfair advantage to white 
and privileged students. Eliminating 
the SAT is necessary to protect 
meaningful gains in underrepre-
sented student enrollment from the 
threat of right-wing lawsuits and 
demagoguery.

SIMONE WILSON, Senior Staff Writer
REPORTING FROM VALPARAISO, CHILE

SERENA RENNER, Senior Staff Writer
REPORTING ON SPAIN

U nlike in Spain, where exchange students practi-cally outnumber the locals, Chile is a long-kept secret still on the brink of being discovered by 
restless American youth dying to prove their sover-
eignty from our internationally mocked doofus of 
an administration. And contrary to many a mental 
image, South America’s Pacific sliver is no third-
world coconut factory; while we up north are busy 
gloating the mere presence of a female candidate 
on the ballot, Chile has been running smoothly 
under the wing of single-mother president Michelle 
Bachelet for almost 
two years now.

The country’s 
spindly stretch of 
beach, desert and 
mountain is almost 
a direct southern-
hemispheric reflec-
tion of California 
— if you tugged at 
the north and south 
ends, bartered down the prices, turned up the reg-
gaeton, plowed over all the Sunday drivers and 
made every hot dog about 10 times more delicious 
(they’re called completos here, no doubt for the avo-
cado portions you’d have to see to believe).

Sure, the majority of pubs and blown-out bus 
radios are stuck in 1980s New York, and hordes of 
plaza punks seem to have missed the message that 
safety pins and anarchy patches are now reserved 
exclusively for 12-year-old Hot Topic employees, 
but Chile — especially Valparaíso, a two-hour trip 
west from smoggy Santiago — is culturally and 
economically advancing at an almost blurry pace. 
Most North American students and travelers com-
plain that prices double upon crossing the border 
from Argentina, but it’s perhaps a bit selfish to 
grudge a restored and thriving economy, especially 
when half the problem is our own plummeting 
dollar.

Vegan co-ops, volunteer centers, art galleries and 
a heavy handful of university buildings squeezed in 

to liven the city’s famous hills, which are themselves 
an incredible source of manmade beauty — a cas-
cade of early-century elevator contraptions and col-
orful architecture built atop ruins from earthquakes 
past. One could probably spend an entire semester 
simply trying to swallow the breathtaking mass of 
Valparaíso’s graffiti, which smothers every rock, 
wall and staircase, layering hungry gray surface 
space with a modern history of man and beast and 
words. Sadly, the city streets and beaches are also 
littered with more trash and stray dogs than anyone 

knows what to do 
with; but in the end 
Valpo’s neglected 
clutter only adds to 
the dark charm that 
separates it from the 
sparkling sidewalks 
of neighboring 
resort-town Viña 
del Mar and the 
workaholic high-

rises of Santiago.
Now’s a fascinating era to attend a Catholic 

University caught between intellectual broad-
mindedness and traditional ideals, especially in a 
fundamentally religious country feeling stronger 
winds than ever from liberal Western culture. If 
you can brave the gringo jabs and begin to catch on 
(cachar) to the language — Chileans proudly claim 
theirs to be the fastest, most colloquially twisted 
Spanish in the world — you may get the rare 
chance to witness a built-up eruption of debate 
over homosexual and women’s rights, family val-
ues, globalization and the devastating separation 
of classes, all dangled over Chile’s particularly 
sensitive political history (little known fact: a good 
chunk of the country still believes Pinochet had 
the right idea). 

And if you’re still itching to pay loose pocket 
change for a pisco sour, Argentina’s collapsed econ-
omy and balls-out nightlife is always just a moun-
tain range away.

This Sliver of South American Land is Home to
Progressive Politics, Alternative Culture

W atching flamenco in dimly lit taverns, three-course lunches followed by afternoon siestas, bull fights, tapas bars and lively city streets 
— these are the experiences that come to life while 
studying abroad in Spain. 

As the only Spanish-speaking European country 
and offering a unique culture and rich historical 
backdrop, Spain has everything the student traveler 
could ask for.

Passing by famous cathedrals and royal pal-
aces en route to school, travelers find themselves 
immersed in ancient history. Students learn about 
the Christian reconquest by setting foot in mosques 
converted to churches, and exploring the fortresses 
where battles took place evokes images of the 
Spanish Civil War. 

Americans can even get a lesson in their own 
history by witnessing the site in Sevilla where 
Christopher Columbus set sail for the New World, 
or by paying homage to King Ferdinand and Queen 
Isabella at their resting place in Granada.

Original paintings by El Greco, Francisco Goya, 
Salvador Dalí and Pablo Picasso inspire visitors, 
and the eclectic, modern architecture of Antoine 
Gaudi colors the streets of Barcelona. Familiar 
scenes from Hemmingway’s work unfold passing 
through the Spanish countryside and one can sense 
the mystery Washington Irving described standing 
on the balconies of Granada’s beautifully preserved 
Moorish city, the Alhambra.

The proximity to both Europe and Africa makes 
Spain a convenient springboard for weekend trips 
to Portugal, ferry rides to Morocco or train routes 
to France, Switzerland and Italy.

But besides being a great place to study and 
travel, the carefree zest of the Spanish life will make 
students not want to leave. 

Spaniards place more weight on their social 
lives than work, planning their days around people 
rather than being controlled by the clock. Locals

DANAI LEININGER, Senior Staff Writer REPORTING ON PAMPLONA, SPAIN
See SPAIN, page 18

R ows of buses full of Spaniards and tourists flock to Pamplona, Spain in early July for the running of the bulls, with some of Spain’s most eager 
souls arriving in the early morning after a sleep-
deprived overnight ride. 

The people — packs of teens and young adults 
toting large jugs of a mysterious dark liquid, elderly 
couples with canvas bags and newlyweds hand-
in-hand — stumble off the buses, anticipating an 
energetic afternoon and even livelier evening, and 
everyone is dressed uniformly in white shirts and red 
bandanas. Uninformed enthusiasts quickly shed any 
disparate clothing and buy overstocked t-shirts and 
irregular bandanas with the hope that no one realizes 
their folly, and they succeed.

The crowds proceed to the town center where a 
carnival awaits, complete with unimpressive games 
and carnies (whose tricks are bound by no borders), 

balloons and a Ferris wheel, which tots and their par-
ents ride until naptime. Toothless Spanish children 
beg their parents for chocolate-covered churros, and 
after a harsh, Spanish “No!” their grandparents say 
yes behind mommy’s back. 

Further along the walk, a fashionable teen sport-
ing a mullet (completely acceptable) tries to knock 
down milk jugs and win his novia a plush toy. Close 
by, his parents sip on café café caf con leche and reminisce 
about how they met at Los Sanfermines many 
moons ago. Across the street in a park, young adults 
wait for nightfall as a Basque rock band does a 
sound check. No one is interested and they instead 
set to work on devouring simple sandwiches con-
sisting of a baguette and the local cured meat. The 
whole environment is very innocent and charming,

J ust to set the record straight, there is noth-ing rotten in the state of Denmark. Quite the opposite, in fact — the small country of 5.5 mil-
lion people, ranked in a recent Leicester University 
study as “the happiest place on Earth,” is filled with 
bicycles, blondes, beer and, yes, real Danish pastries. 
Copenhagen, the country’s capital, is the perfect 
place to study abroad if you’re looking for a big-
town, small-city feel, classes in English (the country’s 
official language is Danish, but children start learn-
ing English in third grade) and a great time.

Copenhagen is also home to Europe’s longest 
pedestrian shopping street, called Strøget. Here you 
can find stores from American favorites like Urban 
Outfitters to European stores like Zara, small tour-
ist shops and even a 7-11. (These can be found 
throughout the city and are frequented by most 
American students.) 

If Copenhagen sounds like the place for you, 
there are opportunities to study here through 
both the Education Abroad Program and the 
Opportunities Abroad Program. Mainly for 
American students — about 500 enroll each semes-
ter — with some Russian and Chinese students, the 
school is conveniently located downtown, adja-
cent to City Hall, Strøget and a cheap student bar 
— what more could you ask for? 

The classes are small, and students enroll in 
a program of their choice, ranging from medical 
practice and policy to European culture and his-
tory, among many others. 

DIS also provides several housing options. Some 
choose to stay with a family, but I opted to stay in 
a kollegium, where many local university students 
live. Kollegiums are similar to dorms on American 
college campuses; however, in Copenhagen they 
are run independently and scattered throughout 
the city.

ERIK JEPSEN, Senior Staff Writer REPORTING ON INDIA

Y es! Fate handed me a cookie, and before I knew what I was doing I was over the Pacific, heading straight for Kolkata, Bengal. When I arrived in this great city of the East, I was sur-
prised to see what one can only describe as an environmentalist’s 
nightmare. Trash piles littered the streets and banks of the Hugli 
River, only to be gathered in droves and burned by city dwellers 
for warmth at night. The air was thick with eye-burning smoke 
that smelled like seven straight years of San Diego wildfires. 
Looking past the poverty and unexpected adventures of the city, 
I found myself immersed in an overwhelming amount of culture 
and architecture that was slowly being absorbed by jungle growth. 
The scene made me feel like I was living in an “Indiana Jones” 
movie. This feeling could have lasted the rest of my life, but alas, 
a few hours later, I was on a domestic flight heading for Siliguri 
in North Bengal.

When I arrived in Siliguri, I was unexpectedly mobbed by 
hundreds of begging children, many of whom were maimed and 
crying, as I made my way to the cockroach-infested train filled 
with peddlers heading for Assam. After a sleepless night on the 
train clutching my camera, I hopped into something resembling a 
Jeep. Traveling for another four hours on half-paved roads filled 
with packs of cattle, scooters and three-wheeled doorless taxis; I 
had finally arrived in the Pokai Gaon village. 

The village was surrounded by freely wandering livestock and 
dried-up rice fields. The villagers lived in huts made of cow dung 
with dead palm leaves or tin for roofs. Local villagers gathered 
around as we set up our tents, amazed at the portable houses that 
we brought with us. The village leader told me this was the first 
time foreigners had ever visited thew village.

Even though I was sleeping on the dirt with mosquitoes and 
using a hole in the ground as a bathroom, I could not have been 
more content. I was quickly treated as part of the extended vil-
lage family. The villagers pampered me to no end, feeding me all

The Land Down Under Holds 
the Ultimate Surfer’s Dream
SARAH DE CRESCENZO, Senior Staff Writer 
REPORTING ON SYDNEY, AUSTRAILIA

T hough the 14.5 hour plane flight has the potential to be pain-ful, a couple of decent sleep-
ing pills will get you to Sydney, 
Australia very well rested and ready 
to explore all the options available 
in this naturephile’s paradise. 

While the downtown scene in 
Sydney is fun, it’s also like other 
major metropolitan areas: a little 
dirty, and there are some places 
you aren’t going to want to be at by 
yourself at night. 

Don’t leave without visiting 
Bondi Beach — a well-known surf-
er’s dream that extends for miles and 
holds more vacationing Irishmen 
than any girl with a penchant for 
accents could hope for.

Bondi is lined with small sushi 
joints and pizza eateries, but don’t 
forget the fish and chips — the 
fish is fresh and the chips (fries, to 
Americans) are thin and perfectly 
salted. 

Enjoy the water but watch out for 
territorial surfers. Another appeal-
ing option is to spend a day people-
watching — travelers come from all 
over to visit Bondi so you won’t be 
disappointed.

After you’re tired of the hustle 
and bustle of Sydney, explore the 
natural beauty the land down under 
has to offer. 

Though the center of Australia 
is very similar to the barren, snake-

ridden desert land you may or may 
not remember from “The Rescuers 
Down Under,” the rest is absolutely 
stunning.

Take a guided bushwalk (basical-
ly, a hiking tour) of any of Australia’s 
National Parks — but make sure not 
to underestimate the intense and 
athletic nature of the experience 
just because you think a walk can’t 
possibly be that taxing. A bushwalk, 
especially if you go for an entire day, 
will encompass many miles, up hun-
dreds of rickety stairs — but it also 
affords views of gorgeous waterfalls 
and animals in the outback like 
the lizards that look like miniature 
dragons.

Visit the majestic Blue Mountains
to see the rock formation with a trio 
of spires called the Three Sisters, 
which stays lit up at night with mas-
sive spotlights. 

The mountains are filled with 
rock climbers, so bring your gear. 
For the novice, there is a plethora of 
climbing teachers that will take you 
to their favorite climbs and disavow 
you of the notion that rock climbing 
in a gym will prepare you for hang-
ing hundreds of feet in the air on the 
edge of a cliff.

Whether you are looking for 
nightlife, beach life or outdoor 
exploration, the land of Australia is 
a great place for picturesque adven-
tures.

Picture-Perfect Rockies the 
Ideal Getaway for Nature Lovers

CONNIE SHIEH, Staff Writer 
REPORTING ON THE CANADIAN ROCKIES

W e Americans often have a laugh at the expense of our Canadian neighbors. But 
accent and teeth jokes aside, the 
Canadian Rockies are breathtaking. 
Henry David Thoreau would liter-
ally have a field day if he were alive 
and had the opportunity to hide 
away in this wilderness.

Being an avid outdoors lover, I 
found Banff National Park a won-
derful place to hike. It is a general 
consensus that Banff is a jewel to 
nature aficionados. The fresh air 

and clean bodies of water, however 
large or small, charm even those 
who are not so inclined to the great 
outdoors. Hiking to the top of a 
mountain not only makes you feel 
invincible, but the number of squir-
rels and mountain goats that greet 
hikers is reminiscent of a Disney 
movie.

Another point of interest is Lake 
Louise, only a few hours’ drive from 
Banff. This body of water is a beau-

spend most of their waking hours 
out in the city, meeting in cafes, pla-
zas and parks by day, then reuniting 
with the family for lunch and the 
afternoon siesta before going out 
again at night. 

Although the country is Catholic 
by tradition, Spaniards are liberal-
minded and know how to party. 
They hop from tapas bars to dis-
cotheques late at night, even con-
gregating in public plazas and on 
cathedral steps, where drinking is 
legal. 

People don’t even get started until 
after 10 p.m. and it’s not uncommon 
for experienced partiers to head 

home at sunrise, validating the ste-
reotype that Spaniards never sleep. 

Given the emphasis on going 
out, it’s no surprise that there are 
more bars per person in Spain than 
in any other country.

With French, North African and 
Mediterranean influences, Spain is 
as diverse as it is historic. The cli-
mate and landscape vary from snow-
capped mountains to olive-dotted 
meadows, but each area offers a 
unique slice of Spanish life. 

Whether it’s the culinary won-
ders of the Basque Country, the 
industrialization and pride of 
Barcelona, the political activity of 

Madrid or the flamenco folklore 
and Moorish influence of Andalusia 
that draws one to study in Spain, all 
experiences will have a few things in 
common — getting lost in charming 
narrow alleys, cheap coffee, beer 
and sangria, and nights spent in 
brick-laden tapas bars surrounded 
by hanging aged ham, all set to the 
sound of Spanish guitar.

More important than history, 
art and language, Spain teaches the 
value of friends and family, the flex-
ibility of time and the way to “dis-
fruta la vida,” or take full advantage 
of life by celebrating morning until 
night — Spanish style.

and an outsider begins to under-
stand the importance of family and 
friends to these people.

Soon the young adults grab their 
jugs full of the half-frozen potion 
and libations are sloppily poured. It 
is calimocho — half red wine and 
half Coke — and the time-tested 
mix goes down well. The botellón, 
the gathering of youngsters drinking 
alcohol in parks or plazas, occurs 
throughout Spain and, in the case of 
large festivals, drinking occurs long 
before sundown.

After dark, the revelers make 
their way to the central plaza, where 
most elders have already staked out 
benches. 

People chat and drink, some 
break into dance while others piss 
on walls, and the spirit of the fes-
tival is alive and well. Without 
notice, fireworks light the sky in 
an awe-inspiring display and the 
finale brings some to tears, some to 
kisses and some to unconsciousness. 
For some it’s a remarkable end to 
the day, and for others it’s a subtle 
beginning to the night.

All night people crowd the 
streets, popping in and out of bars 
to suck down cheap shots and dance 
with strangers, and it’s an impres-
sive sight. They walk along the same 
road that some of them will run 
in a number of hours, but for now 
it’s a scene of controlled insanity. 
People are rowdy but there is neither 
pretension nor ill will, and friendli-
ness is something that transverses 
all languages.

At around 5 a.m. people begin to 
fade, and even some of the steadfast 
partiers have retired to their death-

scented rooms rented out by wid-
ows for obscene amounts of money. 
Those who remain drag their weary 
bodies in search of somewhere to 
watch the running, while others 
enter the stadium and find a seat 
before falling asleep.

Ten minutes before the 8 a.m. 
running, a young Basque separatist 
wakes the crowd with his national-
ist slogans. As he excites the crowd 
with his propaganda, a rocket goes 
off to signal that the encierro has 
begun. 

Almost immediately a trium-
phant runner appears in the sta-
dium, but he is met with jeers for his 
premature entrance. Minutes later 
hundreds of men scurry into the 
ring followed by six agitated bulls. 
The bulls barrel through to the cor-
ral and once they are settled, a group 
of calves are released to bother the 
runners. By now, however, most are 
exhausted and exit for a siesta, for 
they will be doing the same thing 
all week.

The running of the bulls is a 
renowned midsummer spectacle 
that attracts both curious and fool-
hardy spectators and, despite its 
immense popularity with thousands 
of thrill-seeking tourists, it is also 
an amazing and genuine experience 
appreciated by the people of Spain. 
The bulls are the initial allure but 
upon arrival it’s clear that the run-
ning is almost an afterthought, and 
the enjoyment of the festival comes 
from wandering the streets and hav-
ing unabashed fun. For any traveler 
passing through northern Spain in 
early July, it would be difficult to 
miss Los Sanfermines.

varieties of exotic foods, including 
dog. They told me many stories of 
their past histories, some of which 
included cannibalism. 

When the trip came to an end, 
the villagers made a bonfire and 
joked about our obvious American 
habits. The next day, as I boarded 
the bus for the return trip to Siliguri, 
the whole village gathered around to 
watch us leave. I almost wanted to 
cry as I was forced to leave behind 
the best part of the trip, the won-
derful people and children of Pokai 
Gaon. We had become close during 

my short stay, but I knew my bond 
with them would last a lifetime as I 
headed home to America.

Overall, this was the ultimate 
dream trip; I never wanted it to end. 
I would encourage all individuals 
with a strong sense of adventure to 
take this journey across the world 
to a remote village in a developing 
country, one that that has not been 
tainted by Western ideals. The trip 
will take a while, but the memories 
will last forever in your heart; and 
even then, you have those amazing 
photos.

tiful and clear aquamarine blue, 
nestled in the green and misty gray-
white of the neighboring moun-
tains. The Fairmont Hotel stands at 
the bank of the lake as a reminder 
of how expensive it is to have such a 
picture-perfect view.

From the lake, there are numer-
ous trails that take hikers up the 
surrounding mountains to remote 
little teahouses perched at the end 
of miles-long hikes. The people who 
work at these teahouses have to hike 
down to the base of the mountain 
to take out the trash every few days 
and then bring up more supplies. 
All this has to be done by foot since 
there are no roads leading up to 
these isolated cabins. 

On a more somber note, a visit 
to the Colombian Ice Fields gave me 
quite a shock. My family and I took 
a similar trip some nine years ago, 
and the impact of global warming 
is undeniably evident in the reces-
sion of these beautiful glaciers. The 
ice has thinned and there are large 
patches of mud and dry rock where 
there used to be foot after foot of 
solid ice. Perhaps in another couple 
of decades, there may not be any 
glaciers or ice fields to visit, merely 
a large valley.

My recommendation is that you 
take the opportunity to see the best 
of what is left of these natural won-
ders before they disappear forever. 

But seriously, if you should ever 
want to sound your barbaric yawp 
á la “Dead Poet’s Society” or com-
mune with nature, you just may 
want to cross the border — the 
northern border, that is.

Directorkimberly PEIRCE

foreign CONFLICT

W ith the catalyst of the Iraq war as a film’s subject, you might expect 
a lot of soapbox thumping, idealistic 
shouting and sympathetic tears domi-
nating the next two hours of your life 
in the theater seat. But in a surprising 
twist to today’s political toiling, “Stop-
Loss” takes on the soldier’s point of 
view in an apolitical and highly per-
sonal story of one fighter’s return 
home from war. Helmed by the award-
winning director of “Boys Don’t Cry,” 
Kimberly Peirce, “Stop-Loss” is the 
culmination of many soldiers’ person-
al stories and experiences, recorded 
by Peirce herself in the town of Paris, 
Ill.

With her own brother fighting 
abroad, it’s easy to see why Peirce has 
taken such an interest in the quality 
of life awaiting soldiers in the United 
States. Using the vehicle of stop-loss 
— the involuntary extension of a ser-
vice member’s enlistment contract in 
order to retain them beyond the nor-

mal end term 
of service — 

Peirce explores the strong camaraderie 
and love born from fighting that exists 
between GIs. Sergeant Brandon King 
(Ryan Phillippe) is our serviceman in 
the spotlight, a leader who feels he has 
failed his men when he accidentally 
leads them into a terrorist ambush. 
Peirce’s recorded interviews and con-
stant eye on the news shine through 
realistically in moments when King 
leads his men down blind alleys and 
into possible terrorist strongholds. 

Scene by scene, the opening ten-
sion is thick with the ceaseless fear 
troops suffer throughout their patri-
otic duty. Born into a patriotic family 
herself, Peirce said she tried to “get 
as deeply inside what’s going in the 
soldier’s head as possible.” Rather than 
taking a brusque antiwar stance, she 
uses stop-loss to talk about the people 
who are actually supportive of the 
war. King’s inner struggle with serving 
his country and being true to his own 
principles shows that “the people who 

have a problem with stop-loss 
are patriots ... and that the 
movie really tells the story of 
patriots,” Peirce said.

The men’s utter reliance 
on each other is a pivotal 
point, as King fights hard to 
relinquish his title of leader 
once he gets out of the mili-
tary for good. When he returns 
to Texas a decorated hero, we, along 
with King, learn his duties as a leader 
are never actually finished. Besides 
being stop-lossed, he’s still respon-
sible for the fragile mental stability of 
his entire crew. Scenes where soldier 
Steve Shriver (Channing Tatum) digs 
a trench in his front yard to huddle 
down for the night and another where 
Tommy Burgess (the hollow-eyed 
Joseph Gordon-Levitt) breaks a store 
window in a drunken rage merely 
scratch the surface of many more 
gaping mental wounds somewhere 
inside.

as interviewed by 
  AUTUMN SCHUSTER

“When 9/11 happened I had lived in New York 
for 15 years and when the World Trade Center was 
attacked it was really personal. I went to vigils. I 
wanted to explore the soldier’s experience. My little 
brother signed up to be in the war and I would 
[instant message] him in Kuwait and Iraq. His 
first leave home during Thanksgiving I walked in 
on him watching images on video with the song, 
‘Let the Bodies Hit the Floor,’ (playing in the back-
ground). He was watching images that soldiers had 
shot and edited with music. It was a personal look 
at the war. If I was going to make a movie, it was 
going to have an unadulterated feel — the soldiers’ 
images and feelings.”

“I paid for all the research myself because if 
I paid for it then no one could judge it. The guy 

who helped me was a military kid as well and 
came straight out of college. We went to 

Paris, Ill. and interviewed the families 
there.”

“I had a script, I developed a five-
minute trailer with rock music and 

images and then I gave it to the producers. 
[My brother] didn’t want to be involved. But 

when I told him I was going to Iraq and that 
I had found a safe way there, he said, ‘No, it’s 

never safe.’”

“It’s a movie about 
camaraderie with broth-
ers and family. It tells a 
story about a patriotic 
American who joins up 

for all the right reasons 
because he’s from a mili-

tary family. Sergeant Leonard 
King was already in mind before 

the story. Stop-loss is unique to this war 
but it serves as a mechanism for the movie.”

W
hen a movie calls on one of its 
characters to start spouting tag-
lines from the trailer as part of 
his motivational speech (“Never 

give up! Never back down!”), you know 
your brain cells can look forward to a 
very special kind of death.

Relative newcomer Sean Faris 
(“Sleepover”) plays Jake Tyler, a trou-
bled teen expelled from school for fight-
ing during a football game after a rival 
made the mistake of pressing his big 
red “Daddy Issue” button. He moves to 
a new school in Florida, where the girls’ 
uniforms appear to be a low-cut blouse 

with lots of skin. Jake’s past tus-
sling skills catch the attention of 
local bully Ryan McDonald (Cam 
Gigandet). After Ryan’s girlfriend, 
Baja Miller — who, despite living in 
a mansion, doesn’t own any piece of 
clothing bigger than a hanky — sets 
Jake up, reigning champ Ryan pain-
fully and violently introduces him to 

the world of underground mixed martial 
arts fighting. 

Of course, the fact that everyone at 

school is eagerly acquainted with the 
secretive club completely defeats its 
underground status. After having his 
internal organs rearranged, Jake, like any 
good hormonally driven teenager, must 
reclaim his manhood and is informed of 
a veteran fighter with a martial arts gym 
conveniently located down the street. 
Enter Djimon Hounsou to fill the token 
role of “wise minority trainer with myste-
rious foreign accent,” or, in this case, Jean 
Roqua for short. 

The gifted Hounsou, Oscar-nominat-
ed for his work in both “Blood Diamond” 
and “In America,” is reduced to sport-
ing a tuft of mean, salt-and-pepper chin 
hair and delivering enlightened lines like, 
“Those who come here for the wrong 
reasons never last.” Funny how the “right 
reasons” for choking off a rival’s air sup-
ply or employing a submission hold are 
suspiciously never explained.

Cue the training montage and aggres-
sive hip-hop music as Jake prepares for 
the big showdown with the covertness 
Clark Kent would have envied: intel-
ligent high school student by day, crip-

pling karate kid by night. It’s no wonder 
Hounsou described the flick as “refresh-
ing — it’s a light-hearted film.” 

Take notes, kids. Sure, while one-lin-
ers and slapstick are humorous, nothing 
brings on the hilarity quite like hospital-
ization and bleeding orifices.

When asked what message he wanted 
audiences to take away from this movie, 
Faris replied, “It’s not about encouraging 
violence, not ending things with violence 
… to have discipline, self-control, to only 
fight as the last resort to defend yourself 
and those you love.” A true statement, if 
you completely ignore the first 55 min-
utes of the film. 

Unfortunately, Hounsou’s command-
ing presence and Faris’ affability and dis-
arming pre-Scientology Tom Cruise grin 
just can’t ground a flick so removed from 
reality. Parents encouraging beat downs 
or contenders bouncing right back after 
coma-inducing assaults with nary a wince 
all seem to challenge our willingness to 
suspend disbelief. Even the love between

THURSDAY, MARCH 13, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN HIATUS  15

    druthers 
If you’re looking for a little spark of life 

this finals week, you might find hope in the 
Chicago Conspiracy Trial during the turbulent 
1960s, chronicled in Brett Morgen’s invigorating 
documentary, aptly titled “Chicago 10.” 
Remember when university students stood up to 
authorities in the name of mass change, on both 
social and political levels? Probably not, but 
that was the idealism-laden reality for many in 

1968, when student counterculture leaders and 
activists like Abbie Hoffman and Bobby Seale, 
took the stand to speak for the nation’s youth 
following the disastrous Democratic Convention. 
Combining archival footage, animation and the 
voice talents of Hank Azaria and Liev Schreiber, 
the one-week engagement of “Chicago 10” 
takes you to the time when students shouted 
back. (CM)

HIATUS PICKS
THE WEEK’S

BEST BETS
Lying somewhere between the San Diego and 

New York jazz scenes, James Gordon Williams takes 
a social approach to syncopated rhythms and 
downbeats. Various numbers titled “Dance of the 
Hopeful” and “Why Must I Pursue This Dream” allude 
to an aura in touch with both the personal and mass 
conscience, immediately beckoning its listeners to 
share their individual responses collectively. 

Williams often finds himself lyrically sliding 
across his piano, picking a melodic idea and then 
stretching it to its apex. Even slower ballads like 
“Reaching for My Shadow” find an enigmatic, albeit 
restrained, charge. 

Like all good jazz, this requires an attentive, 
participatory ear to engage in emotive, sometimes 
challenging, chords. (CM)

Senior Staff Writer

I t’s usually quite a compliment when someone else wants to remake your movie. It means that, somewhere down the line, you made an impression on a young filmmaker 
or hot-shot producer with some cash to blow. But if you’re 
the same director who made the original, don’t you think 
you should leave well enough alone? Austrian director 
Michael Haneke, renowned for 
art house hits “Cache” and “The 
Piano Teacher,” doesn’t think so.

So why remake your own 
film? The answer lies directly 
in the subject matter of “Funny 
Games,” as two pristinely dressed 
white gentlemen (Paul, played by 
Michael Pitt and Peter, played by 
Brady Corbet, among other names they use) play terrible 
games of brutality with a yuppie family of three. Starring 
the mostly non-American cast of Tim Roth (George Sr.), 
Naomi Watts (Ann) and Devon Gearhart (little Georgie 
Jr.) the three actors play irritatingly futile characters who 
crawl their way through the film with little to no back-

bone. If two psychotic sadists broke into your lakeside 
summer cabin and started terrorizing your family just for 
kicks, you might be ill-prepared to lay the smack down at 
first, but the primordial instinct of survival would inevi-
tably kick in, right? Not for Ann and George, who manage 
to get beaten down with golf clubs, stabbed with knives 
and tortured without even the slightest hint of a gun hold-
ing them hostage. Georgie Jr. actually comes out as the 
ballsiest one of the bunch — and he’s only 12.

It starts out compellingly enough, with an 
overhead view of the family’s Range Rover 
cruising merrily along a scenic road to an 
operatic soundtrack, before the serenity 
is quickly shattered by heavy-metal death 
screams and blood-red lettering: “Funny 
Games.” It’s chilly and enticing, giving you 
the intended goose bumps of fear for these 
poor upper-class saps. From the instant Peter 

pops into the kitchen to borrow some eggs from Ann, 
it’s obvious he has no intention of leaving. At the same 
time, it’s curious that even a polite lady would just 
allow a relative stranger in her house and put up with

Clark
■ Turning Dragon
WARP

L et’s have some of that Aphex acid! England’s Chris Clark revives the now-obsolete I.D.M. (Intelligent Dance Music. 
Yes, it’s pretentious.) moniker and spirit with 
a Justice-era crunch on his new foray into 
jungle noise, Turning Dragon. 

It’s obvious that Clark grew up worship-
ping Richard D. James’ playfully disturbing 
techno catalogue, and has proudly taken 
the torch now that James is too reclusive 
to release a proper Aphex Twin record. But 
listeners beware: every beat, synth pad and 
chopped-up vocal crackles with heavy distor-
tion. 

In the case of stunner epic “For Wolves 
Crew,” the harsh assault works in Clark’s 
favor. The track greets us with bubbling 
robo-bass and an innocuous click-clack, but 
slowly turns more sinister as the sine waves 
languish, then attack without warning. On 
the other hand, the speaker-busting tones fall 
flat on “Vionl,” which aurally rapes you for a 
few minutes while overstaying its welcome 

through its endless static repetition. 
Then there’s “Radiation Clutch,” an exer-

cise in glitch minimalism that invades your 
inner ear with frequencies expertly attuned 
to cause bleeding, perfect for the closet mas-
ochist. Or sadist; play “BEG” in a car full of 
friends and watch their heads explode long 
before the tranquil second half. 

What distinguishes Clark the most from 
’90s Aphex acid is his acute sense of pace and 
relative restraint. His compositions are metic-
ulous, to be sure, but they aren’t mathematical 
equations built on towers of interlocking per-
cussion like Drukqs or the Richard D. James 
album. More than anything, Turning Dragon 
makes me excited to hear Clark do introspec-
tive ambient work, hopefully playing up the 
downtime between tech bombasts where he 
lets the eerie synths speak for themselves. For 
now, a happy headache will suffice.

recordings

W ith a band name like What Made Milwaukee Famous, listeners pretty damn well expect to hear 40 minutes 
of toe-tapping melodies and lyrical goodness 
that keeps them salivating for more. But lo 
and behold, the Austin indie-pop band’s What 
Doesn’t Kill Us falls a bit short of a tasty help-
ing of musical genius, and is instead doused 
in sludgy tunes and country crooning. 

The first track, “Blood, Sweat & Fears,” 
poorly introduces the record. Michael Kincaid 
groans about a rehab stay, creepily crying out, 
“I don’t know how I got into this mess/ I must 
have been pulled/ On my hands and knees/ 
By my hair and teeth.” 

But rather than inducing a chipper Amy 
Winehouse doo-wop vibe, the constant dron-
ing of a moody riff and heavy synth leaves 
listeners dazed and confused as to what they 
just heard. 

“The Right Place” is another disappoint-
ingly ambitious song with whining drum 
and guitar melodies, sounding annoyingly 

similar to the overplayed raucousness of the 
emotionally drunk, eyeliner-wearing lads of 
Green Day. 

Still, it wouldn’t be fair to diss the entire 
album without giving praise to the mel-
lifluous, Decemberists-esque sounds of 
“Resistance St.” As the first single, and for 
good reason, the band trades in brassy hooks 
for more subtle acoustic strumming and 
tender piano notes, thus making an impres-
sive transformation that is sure to cheer up 
bummed fans. “And the Grief Goes On …” is 
another song worthy of multiple listens with 
its catchy, galloping pop beat in the breath of 
the Format. 

That said, don’t be sad, friends. Take it 
from the band’s album name and Kanye’s 
cheesy-but-ever-so-catchy cliché, What 
Doesn’t Kill Us only makes What Made 
Milwaukee Famous stronger.

BARSUK

Attack on Suburbia Stings the Audience and Misses Sympathy
his oddly insistent demands. And who but a 
pair of serial killers would wear white gloves 
anyway? Haneke’s idyllic setup is perfect, show-
ing the grandiose lifestyle that the family takes 
for granted. His destruction of gentility is also 
delightful as he implicates the audience in Paul’s 
crimes. There’s no greater chilling moment in the 
on-screen savagery than the moment Paul turns 
his amiable eyes to the camera and talks to the 
moviegoer.

The main beef with “Funny Games” is that the 
plot gets unbelievable to the point where it insults 
your intelligence before shocking your sense of 
morality. If the goal, as Haneke claims, is to get 
the audience to question why they enjoy watching 

violent movies and shows on TV, then why not 
make the cruelty malicious and genuinely teth-
ered to reality? Even 
if Haneke is truly 
just mindfucking the 
audience by breaking 
fourth-wall barriers, 
it’s a little easier to 
swallow a theatri-
cal cause if you feel 
a smidge of empathy 
for characters in the 
film. Though he’s 
going for an attack on 
the American midline (sorry suburbia, but that 
means you), it’s not attractive or humble when 

Haneke admits that he remade the film specifical-
ly because he felt the original hadn’t reached the 

intended “English-
speaking audiences,” 
like us Americans. 
It’s also troubling 
that it comments 
on American cul-
tural values and our 
obsession with brutal 
entertainment with-
out taking the major-
ity of Americans 
into account. From 

the get-go, Watts’ perfect blonde hair and floral 
housedress don’t really hint of home, but rather 

colorless symbolism. She’s certainly not my next-
door neighbor.

Though beautifully shot and edited, some-
thing doesn’t sit right with the point the director 
is trying to drive home. Every scene divorces itself 
further from reality in Haneke’s effort to play 
with the audience’s participation in the sadism on 
screen. Even with big George down for the count 
after a broken leg, there is still the dream that dear 
ol’ ma could grow a pair and fuck some bitches 
up. But everyone ambles easily along.

Haneke, if you wanted Americans to watch 
your movie so badly, you should have dubbed 
your old shit and called it a day. At least you 
could have saved millions of dollars and a lot of 
folks’ time.

Why?
■ Alopecia
ANTICON

W hen you think of Bay Area hip-hop, images of nerdy Jewish street-poets usually 
don’t come to mind. Yoni Wolf, his 
brother Josiah and Doug McDiarmid 
comprise the surrealist indie-rap 
mishmash, Why? (with the ques-
tion mark), creating a genre play-
ground that pairs knowingly clever 
story-raps with live instrumentation 
supplying the thick beats, plucked 
guitar-work and somber piano. 

Part one of the Why? experi-
ence is the lyrics. Wolf ’s delivery 
could best be described as “whiny-
teen-with-a-cold”; he raps through 
his nose in a talky monotone, not 
concerned with street cred whatso-
ever. That attitude carries through 
in the subject matter, which blends 
urban wit with intimate anecdotes 
full of vivid imagery. Here’s a gem 
from “The Fall of Mr. Fifths,” one of 
many: “Just another Sunday paddle-
boat ride/ on a manmade lake with 
another lady stranger/ if I remain 
lost and die on a cross/ at least I 
wasn’t born in a manger.” Also, Wolf 
often veers into morbid self-dep-

recation and absurd word pairings, 
describing his own “coffin rehears-
als” and “hollow bones” through the 
guise of mundane city life, which 
may put some listeners off.

Part two is the off-kilter pop 
approach the band takes with its 
instruments that crafts the setting 
for Wolf ’s lyrics to breathe. They 
take full advantage of the studio, 
capturing pleasant chain jingles and 
bizarre marimba synths that com-
plement the familiar guitar-drums-
piano tones. Lead single “The 
Hollows,” for example, is built on 
an entwining loop of staccato guitar, 
rolling bass ambience and insistent 
piano playing away at the forefront; 
without the nasally voice, it could be 
a Wolf Parade track covered by the 
Arcade Fire. That means indie chops 
minus the posturing. The result is 
a highly eccentric group that won’t 
appeal to most folks, but those who 
are down will find the Oakland four-
piece oddly addicting.

recordings STALE PUNCHES MAKE
FOR SLOPPY SECONDS

Jake and Baja grows so banal and agonizing that 
we pray they just quickly shag and be done with 
the whole mess.

To call “Never Back Down” a cliche would 
be much too easy — accurate, but easy. It’s more 
of an irritating, forced trip down memory lane, 
taking you back to the archetypal, much more 
believable storylines of “The Karate Kid” or even 
“Bloodsport,” if you subtracted Van Damme’s 
French accent, substituted the Hong Kong back-
drop for Orlando and threw in some unabashed 
product placement for YouTube to make it more 
relatable to today’s generation. Hell, they even 
included the wise-cracking, floppy-haired best 
friend/sidekick for nostalgia’s sake. 

If nothing else, it’s an exercise in the fine art of 
plagiarism. Writer Chris Hauty seems to borrow 
key plot elements from more entertaining martial 
arts predecessors, throw them against the wall and 
incorporate what sticks into a story, proving once 
again that the Spaghetti Method, though it works 
wonders for pasta, is disastrous for film.

▶ DOWN, from page 14

Vet’s Homecoming
Lacks a Lady’s Touch

King’s feelings of failure and indignant civic loyalty 
permeate his need to escape the service. After going 
AWOL with his best friend’s girl, King embarks on a 
long journey to fight for his freedom, riding the equiva-
lent of a Canadian underground railroad in an attempt 
to garner the political support of a reticent senator. But 
around every corner, Peirce delves into the shadiness 
of the federal government and resulting deterioration 
of King’s men. It doesn’t take much to see that turning 
your lawn into makeshift barracks is not what people 
would call a peaceful assimilation, but that doesn’t mean 
anyone will do anything about it.

The pain of a soldier’s home life only seems to be 
worsened by the abandonment they face at the hands 
of their female counterparts. In a disappointing boggle, 
every woman (except for King’s mother) splits the sec-
ond there’s a whiff of trouble. From divorce to separa-
tion, every young woman in the film seems to have little 
to no patience for what their man is going through. 
Why? Perhaps it’s a case of going through too much shit 
for too long, but it’s disheartening when a female direc-
tor writes off almost every woman in her film.

In a prettier, glossier Hollywood glow than her pre-
vious endeavor, “Stop-Loss” loses Peirce’s gritty feel of 
“Boys Don’t Cry.” The film feels like a polished nugget 
of gentle biography obscured in the hubbub of subtle 
political slant and man candy. Its message is understood 
quickly enough, but the gleam of manufactured smooth-
ness sacrifices a jagged reality that would otherwise 
make the film resonate. Hilary Swank’s chiseled jaw just 
has more daring than Phillippe’s delicate flounce. Opens 
March 28.

THURSDAY, MARCH 13, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN SPORTS  21

Northern Arizona was a one-sided 
affair, with UCSD taking an early 3-0 
lead by sweeping the doubles matches. 
At the top doubles spot, Triton seniors 
Blake Meister and Eric Rubens rolled 
through Chris Arena and Bradley 
Bristow of Northern Arizona, 8-3. 
Rubens and Meister had participated 
in the 119th edition of the Pacific 
Coast Men’s Doubles Championships 
earlier in the day, but had little trouble 
with the double duty. In the second 
doubles match, sophomore Bijam 
Moallemi teamed with freshman Erik 
Elliott, making his UCSD debut, to 
take out Jeff Morys and Renzo Lau in a 
hard-fought 8-6 win. The third doubles 
match was a blowout for UCSD, with 
junior Kazumi Negishi and sophomore 
Alex Placek taking out Jacob Tracy and 
Ryan Fraser by an 8-2 score.

The Tritons also took five of the 
six singles matches, with the top three 
in the lineup winning in straight sets. 
At number one, Rubens used an all-
court game to take out Arena with 
ease, 6-1, 6-2. Moallemi looked just as 
impressive at the second spot, defeat-
ing Morys by a 6-0, 6-2 score. In the 
number three singles match, Negishi 
was able to take out Bristow 6-1, 6-3. 
In the most dramatic match of the day, 
Meister survived a grueling three-set-
ter against Tracy, overcoming an early 
deficit to win 4-6, 6-4, 7-5. 

In Northern Arizona’s only victory 
of the afternoon, David Flodberg was 
able to overcome a rough second set to 
beat Placek at the fifth spot, 6-1, 1-6, 
6-1. In the final singles match, Vince 
Nguyen scored a come-from-behind 
win, defeating Fraser 4-6, 6-0, 6-3.

Two days after their blowout vic-
tory, the Tritons were humbled by the 
undefeated Fresno Pacific Sunbirds, 
who dominated singles to earn the 
one-sided victory.

UCSD’s worst loss of the season 
began in discouraging fashion, as 
the Tritons lost two of three doubles 
matches to fall behind early. Elliott and 

Moallemi looked sharp in overwhelm-
ing the Fresno Pacific duo of Marco 
Foelz and Victor Medina at the second 
doubles spot, winning by an 8-1 score. 
However, at the first and third doubles 
spots, UCSD suffered difficult loss-
es that made the team visibly rattled 
before singles started. 

Rubens and Meister suffered only 
their second loss of the spring season 
as a doubles tandem, losing a tough 
8-6 match to Matt Caroll and Vicente 
Joli. Negishi and Placek lost by the 
same score at the third doubles posi-
tion to Fabio Silva and Maxine Adam. 
The Tritons had opportunities to win 
both matches, but their failure to take 
advantage gave the Sunbirds all the 
momentum entering singles.

In singles, Fresno Pacific won five 
of the six singles matches in straight 
sets. The only match to go the distance 
was at the second spot, where Joli was 
able to narrowly get by Rubens, 6-4, 
3-6, (10-6). Moallemi had the most 
competitive of the straight set losses, 
dropping a 7-6, 6-4 decision to Carroll 
at the top spot. Freshman Armaun 
Emami, who has had key victories in 
doubles play this year, made his singles 
debut against Adam, but lost 7-5, 6-0. 
In the final singles match, Medina was 
able to get by Elliott, who was also 
making his singles debut, by a score 
of 6-1, 6-3.

Looking to stop their losing streak 
at one, the Tritons entered their most 
competitive contest this year in a 
rescheduled match against Concordia 
that was rained out on Feb. 20. The 
Tritons won two of three doubles 
matches to gain an early edge. Meister 
and Rubens used efficient serving and 
precise volleys to take out Concordia’s 
top doubles team, Tim Kpulun and 
Bryan Newell, 8-5. Moallemi and Elliott 
improved to 3-0 as a tandem, beating 
Chris Nguyen and Daniel Ndlela by 
an 8-3 score at number two doubles. 
Concordia was able to get on the board 
when Augusto Elias and Olivier Fabre 
beat the Tritons’ Placek and Negishi by 

a score of 8-4.
However, the Eagles turned the tide 

in singles, winning four of six matches 
to earn a tight 5-4 win. Kpulun took 
revenge on Rubens for his loss in dou-
bles, getting by the UCSD senior, 6-3, 
7-5. Moallemi was able to improve to 
2-1 as the team’s No. 2 singles player, 
easily getting by Elias, 6-2, 6-0. In 
one of two crucial three-set victories 
for Concordia, Ndlela squeezed past 
Negishi by a score of 6-4, 2-6, 6-3 at the 
third spot. In the other game-chang-
ing match, Nguyen of Concordia got 
past Emami by a 6-4, 2-6, 6-4 in No. 5 
singles. The Tritons needed to win only 
one of the three-setters to clinch the 
contest, but the Eagles got both, and 
with it, stole the victory. 

The Tritons match against Gonzaga 
was somewhat uneventful, with UCSD 
cruising to easy victory in anticipation 
of its match against Rollins.

The meeting with Rollins was 
fairly balanced, with the squads split-
ting singles’ play and the Tritons edg-
ing the Tars 2-1 in doubles play. The 
most exciting match against Rollins 
was the number-one singles match 
between Moallemi and Rollins’ Brian 
Compton. Moallemi started strong 
against Compton, winning the first 
set 6-3, but Compton roared back and 
won consecutive sets (6-7, 8-10) to 
steal the victory. The only other singles 
match that went three sets was the 
number five matchup, in which Pablo 
Seijo outlasted Placek 6-2, 6-7, 14-12.

Now finished with the five-game 
homestand over a 10-day period, the 
Tritons will be off during finals, in 
preparation for the Blue/Grey Classic 
that will take place in Montgomery, 
Ala. during March 25-29 of Spring 
Break. Following that, the Tritons will 
begin their stretch run, finishing up 
with four more regular season matches 
before NCAA Regionals and the tour-
nament start.

22 SPORTS THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY, MARCH 13, 2008

March 7, the Tritons used two Sonoma 
State errors to put up five runs in the 
second inning, more than enough sup-
port for the ever-dominant Ward. The 
southpaw allowed only six base runners 
and picked up seven strikeouts. Senior 
second-baseman Danielle Lukk’s 
fourth inning single up the middle 
gave UCSD its sixth run. Although the 
Seawolves scratched a run across the 
board, the Tritons emerged unscathed 
with a 6-1 victory. 

The second game of the series was 
more of a pitcher’s duel, when Chastain 
turned in her best outing of the year, 
hurling a one-hit shutout in the Tritons’ 
3-0 win. Junior first-baseman Jenni 
Habib collected three hits while senior 
third-baseman Jenny Maze picked up 
two hits and an RBI. 

While the Maze-Habib connec-
tion has carried the UCSD offense for 
most of the season, the series’ second 
doubleheader on March 8 saw a more 
consistent lineup emerge, a quality that 
makes the already dangerous Triton 
attack all the more potent. In the first 
game, sophomore catcher Nicole Saari 
and junior center-fielder Allison May 
each picked up two hits out of the 
eighth and ninth spots, respectively. 
All but one Triton starter got a hit in 
the game and Ward tossed another 
gem, limiting Sonoma State to only a 
two-out seventh inning run en route 
to a 5-1 UCSD win. 

The win pushed Ward’s season 
record to 8-5, which is in no way 
indicative of stellar pitching all year. 
With an ERA of 1.88, her five losses 
can be explained by relatively low run 

support, so being spotted 11 runs in 
two games came as a welcome relief for 
the veteran pitcher.

“It’s been a while [since getting two 
wins in a weekend] so it’s good to get 
the wins and get the confidence back 
up,” Ward said. “I can relax a bit more 
out on the mound. It’s nice to know 
that if I give up a couple hits or a couple 
runs that we’re still going to be in it.”

Chastain picked up where Ward 
left off in the series finale and pushed 
her own season record to 8-1 with 
seven innings of one-run ball. Maze 
smacked her fifth homerun of the year 
(and 30th in her career) while the more 
balanced Triton offense continued to 
suceed, with freshman shortstop Sarah 
Woofter driving a ball to deep left 
center for a two-run homerun of her 
own. 

The Tritons have known all year 
that their hitters can produce up and 
down the lineup and that it was just a 
matter of time that their true offense 
stepped to the plate. 

“We went out like the team we 
knew we were with our heads in the 
right place and finally started to hit 
the ball,” sophomore catcher Nicole 
Saari said. “People are just really start-
ing to click; we have been working on 
hitting a lot in practice lately.”

Riding a four-game winning streak 
and being branded with a national 
ranking, the Tritons will next take 
their momentum on the road when 
they travel to Cal State Stanislaus for 
a four-game series starting March 14.

from freshman Guido Knudson, who 
went seven strong innings to pick 
up his third win this year, and reli-
able relief work from freshman Tim 
Shibuya and senior Keith Noe, who 
combined for two scoreless innings 
to seal the win.

After splitting the two games in 
Los Angeles, the Tritons returned 
home for a doubleheader on March 
8 and won the first game 2-1 but fell 
short, 6-2, in the series finale.

The Tritons got all the offense they 
would need from freshman outfield-
er Evan Kehoe’s two-run homerun 
in the first contest’s second inning. 
However, the two runs barely held up, 
as UCSD needed three double-plays 
to make up for the Golden Eagles’ 
eight walks and eight hits. Sophomore 
starting pitcher Kirby St. John went 
five innings to pick up his third win 
before giving way to Shibuya, who 
held Cal State Los Angeles scoreless 
from the sixth through the eighth 
innings. Noe came on in the ninth 
and picked up his third save of the 
year.

“We feel like if we have a lead late 
in the ballgame, it’s going to be awful-
ly hard to beat us [because of our 
bullpen],” O’Brien said. “Our starting 
pitching has been just OK but our 
bullpen has been outstanding. [In 
that game] we had quality pitching 
and good defense and then, of course, 
we have an outstanding closer who 
came in and finished the deal.”

In the series finale, the Golden 
Eagles scored a run each in the first 
two innings then two runs each in 
the next two to jump out to a 6-0 lead. 
UCSD threatened briefly in the sixth, 
as Cantele led off the inning with a 
double and came around to score 
on senior designated hitter Chris 
Franco’s single. Although the Tritons 
continued to rally with another dou-
ble, they could only muster a sacrifice 
fly to score a second run, which was 
the last they would get. Cal State Los 
Angeles’ John Mitchell went the dis-
tance in the game, allowing just the 
two runs on nine hits and no walks in 
the seven-inning complete game.

With the loss in the series finale, 
UCSD falls to 19-5 overall and 9-2 
in the CCAA. A four-game series 
against Cal State Dominguez Hills is 
up next for the Tritons, who will play 
two road games on March 13 and 14 
before hosting the Toros in a double-
header on March 15.

“We want to win every series and 
we want to set our expectations high 
to sweep every series,” O’Brien said. 
“But if you don’t come to play every 
single day in our conference, any 
team can beat you. And I think we 
found that out against Cal State Los 
Angeles. If our guys get themselves 
ready to play and stick to their plan, 
then we should have a very successful 
weekend [CSUDH].”

Wild Card. But this could be the year 
when the Yankees are bad enough that 
they are limited to watching the Red 
Sox tear through another postseason 
while Hank Steinbrenner kicks him-
self repeatedly for losing the Johan 
Santana sweepstakes. Last year’s freak 
invasion of bugs during the playoff 
series against the Indians is evidence 
that the baseball gods are angry with 
the Yankees’ blatant disregard for the 
luxury tax and Alex Rodriguez’s over-
use of lip gloss. Hopefully, the baseball 
gods will continue to haunt baseball’s 
most hated team with more years of 
baseball futility and stop the Red Sox 
from continuing down the path they 
are headed, in which they are mor-
phing into the 21st century Yankees. 
The BoSox will inevitably win the 
East and are a definite favorite to win 
it all again, but could run into trouble 
with both the Tigers in the League 
Championship Series and Mets in the 
World Series, if they can make it that 
far. But with a drool-inducing combi-
nation of smart veteran hitters in Big 
Papi and crazy Manny Ramirez and 
young table-setters in Dustin Pedroia 
and Jacoby Ellisbury, the Red Sox have 
an offense capable of putting a 10-spot 
on any given night. And their pitch-
ing could be even better than it was 
when they won the championship last 
year. Reigning Cy Young winner Josh 
Beckett is coming off a 20-win season 
in which he looked nearly unhittable 
in the playoffs. Beckett should be a 
lock for another 18-20 wins, assum-
ing this back spasm business is no big 
deal, and Dice-K Matsuzaka will inev-
itably improve after his struggles in 
adjusting to Major League hitters last 
year. In Jon Lester and Clay Bucholz, 
the Sox also have two young starters 
with very high upside and a chance to 
round out a formidable rotation. 

The Rays, Jays and Orioles might 
as well be minor-league teams in 
this division, and although they 
have some potential, by the time the 

youngsters are ready to compete with 
the Yankees, Steinbrenner will have 
gone out and signed Prince Fielder, 
Garret Atkins and every other young 
free agent available in a payroll of 
over $350 million.

While the East is a gimme, the 
AL Central is a two-team race. The 
Tigers, who choked in the home 
stretch of the playoff race last year, 
had a huge off-season, adding Miguel 
Cabrera, Dontrelle Willis and Edgar 
Renteria. Cabrera and Renteria will 
make Detroit’s offense even scarier 
and put the Tigers on the Yankees’ 
and Red Sox’s level. But the Tigers 
do not have the same strong rota-
tion the Sox have, and Dontrelle, he 
of the 5.00 ERA, is not the answer. 
While the Tigers spent the off-season 
retooling, the Indians mostly stood 
pat with a team that tied with Boston 
for the Major League lead in wins. 
The Indians, with C.C. Sabathia and 
Fausto Carmona, own the best one-
two punch in baseball and have a 
top-to-bottom lineup that can score 
with the best of them. The rest of 
the division “rivals” are hardly that, 
as Minnesota traded away its entire 
team for prospects over the win-
ter, the White Sox “big” acquisition 
was Nick Swisher and the Royals 
are still years away from relevance 
under the Alex Gordon-Billy Butler 
era. While Detroit spent more and 
has an offense that any Giant fan 
would envy (actually, that’s not saying 
much; I envy the Marlins’ lineup), I’ll 
take the Indians to repeat as division 
champs behind a bounce-back year 
from Travis Hafner.

Like in the NL version, the AL 
West should be the most competi-
tive. The Angels and Mariners are the 
favorites, but no matter who wins, 
they are doomed for a first-round 
playoff exit. The Angels, free-spend-
ers as always, lured Torii Hunter away 
from the Twins and now have four old 
and overpaid outfielders along with 
Vladimir Guerrero, Garrett Anderson 

and Gary Matthews, Jr. The Anaheim 
lineup is formidable and the rotation 
is solid but I like Seattle as divi-
sion champs instead. The addition of 
Erik Bedard, an automatic ace, takes 
the pressure off of youngster Felix 
Hernandez, who has choked the last 
two years as the leader of the staff. 
And any lineup with Ichiro at the top 
is going to score a lot of runs, so look 
for the Mariners to pull off a long win 
streak in August and then hold off 
the Angels in September to tame the 
West. The Rangers and A’s are both 
rebuilding, although Oakland fans 
must be getting frustrated at losing at 
least one great pitcher every off-sea-
son, and have no chance at making an 
impact this year.

Now to the fun stuff: the playoff 
picks. 
NLDS: Chicago Cubs over Arizona  
Diamondbacks in five games and New 
York Mets over Colorado Rockies in 
four games.
ALDS: Cleveland Indians over Seattle 
Mariners in four games and Detroit 
Tigers over Boston Red Sox in five 
games.
NLCS: New York Mets over Chicago 
Cubs in six games.
ALCS: Cleveland Indians over Detroit 
Tigers in seven games.
World Series: New York Mets over 
Cleveland Indians in six games.

After last year’s historic September 
collapse, I know that David Wright 
and Jose Reyes want postseason glory 
even more. And Johan Santana must 
be aching for a ring after spend-
ing his career with the cash-strapped 
Twins. The Mets also have a deep 
and talented rotation capable of 
matching up with any others. Even 
Sabathia and Carmona will have a 
tough time against Santana in Game 
One and Pedro Martinez in Game 
Two. And with rumors, albeit uncon-
firmed  ones, the Mets could sign 
Barry Bonds to replace Moises Alou, 
there’s no telling what this team is 
capable of.

form, giving UCSD the win.
Pacific took early leads in games 

two and three and the Tritons were 
never able to recover. Down by five 
in game two, UCSD pulled within 
one after a Fritsch kill but couldn’t 
stop a pair of small Tiger runs, as the 
lead was stretched to four and Pacific 
cruised to the win. Game three was 
more of the same, as UCSD fell vic-
tim to a 10-4 Pacific run.

The Tritons rallied in the must-
win situation, taking a 16-11 lead in 
game four and never relinquishing 
it. After the Tigers pulled within 
one, at 18-17 UCSD recorded back-
to-back kills to extend the lead to 
four. Pacific again pulled within 
one, but this time it was the Triton 
defense that came up in the clutch, 
as Spangler and sophomore middle 
blocker Gerald Houseman recorded 
a block to open the eventual three-
point cushion of victory.

The Tritons looked solid in a 
decisive game five, playing their best 
volleyball of the night. They took 
an early 6-4 lead and led by three 
when the teams exchanged sides. 
The advantage became four before a 
Hardy and Houseman block finished 
the match.

Ring said the team had progres-
sively improved throughout each 
game of the match and it all culmi-
nated in the fifth game with three 
blocks and aggressive serving.

Trying to build on its victory the 
night before, UCSD was smothered 
by No. 7 Stanford University 23-30, 
30-20, 30-23, 30-23 on March 8, 
despite playing a solid first game.

Down 14-15, the Tritons put 
together a 10-5 run to close out game 
one, highlighted by the Tritons’ tran-
sition game. 

“The transition game is some-
thing we work on a lot during prac-

tice and are fairly good at,” Ring said. 
“We got some good swings during 
[the run] coming off blocked swings 
and overpasses.”

The Cardinal took control in 
games two and three with an over-
powering offense. Falling behind 
early in both games, the Tritons were 
unable to put together any sort of run 
and lacked the spark they had in the 
latter half of game one. 

Game four was a different tune, 
as UCSD held a slim 17-16 lead but, 
yet again, a pair of late Cardinal runs 
finished the Tritons.

Ring said that while the five-game 
match the night before had some 
effect, he believes that while Stanford 
made the right adjustments after the 
first game, UCSD didn’t. 

“The guys starting Friday started 
Saturday so there was a little bit of 
fatigue,” he said. “But Stanford came 
out flat in that first game and their 
mistakes kept us going. A team of 
that caliber makes changes when 
it loses a game and it did. They 
stepped up their play and we weren’t 
making the plays to match it.”

Despite the loss, the Tritons 
believe there are still many oppor-
tunities to do things that have never 
been done before in the program. 
The team’s first goal: set the single-
season wins mark with nine victo-
ries. UCSD will have to win three of 
its final nine to set the record, some-
thing that is very possible, accord-
ing to Ring.

“We’re still evaluating where we 
are and setting new goals each week 
for players and the team,” he said. 
“Our primary goal now as a team is 
to set the single-season win mark. 
That chance is something that drives 
us to keep playing harder.”

HOT CORNER

THURSDAY, MARCH 13, 2008

By Rael Enteen
Sports Editor

BASEBALL — After starting their 
conference schedule with seven 
straight wins, the No. 14 Tritons 
split a series against Cal State Los 
Angeles and are now tied for second 
place in California Collegiate Athletic 
Association standings.

With series sweeps against Cal State 
San Bernardino and Cal Poly Pomona, 
UCSD entered the four-game series 
against the Golden Eagles with a con-
fident pitching staff and an offense that 
was clicking. But the Tritons dropped 
the series opener on March 6 in Los 
Angeles, 5-2, in their first CCAA loss, 
and picked up another loss in the sec-
ond game of a doubleheader at Triton 
Baseball Field on March 8. UCSD did 
salvage a split with a 6-2 win on the 
road on March 7 and came out ahead 
in a close contest to open the double-
header in San Diego.

“I think we still feel like we should 
have won the series but they just 
flat out beat us in two out of the 
four games,” head coach Dan O’Brien 
said.

The Tritons’ hot bats fell victim to 
great pitching when UCSD matched 
up with the Golden Eagles, who won 
the NCAA Division II West Regionals 
in 2007. Cal State Los Angeles’ Isaac 
Morales allowed only one earned run 
in 8.2 innings to pick up the win, 
despite giving up eleven hits and 
walking three.

“We swung the bat well against 
him but we didn’t bunch any hits 

together,” O’Brien said. “But most 
importantly they didn’t give us any-
thing ... they made plays behind good 
pitchers and that’s why we didn’t put 
up big runs.”

UCSD came alive in the sec-
ond game of the series, pounding 
the Golden Eagle pitching with 14 
hits that amounted to six runs. The 
Tritons broke a 1-1 tie in the fifth 

inning thanks to a solo homerun 
off the bat of junior outfielder Nick 
Burke. Another long ball, junior first-
baseman Matt Cantele’s fourth of the 
season, put the game out of reach in 
the seventh inning, as UCSD went 
ahead 5-1 after the two-run shot.

“We just want to have the kind of 
lineup that a pitcher can’t feel com-
fortable at any time; he knows that 

he’s facing nine guys that can drive 
the ball out of ballpark,” O’Brien said. 
“Some days we’re better at that than 
others but we have a lineup with a 
lot of presence and if the guys stick 
to their plan at the plate, we can be a 
pretty potent offense.”

The Tritons also got a strong start

No. 14 Tritons Take First CCAA Loss UCSD Upsets 
UOP in Another 
Program First

VOLLEYBALL — The UCSD men’s 
volleyball team set another school 
record last weekend by surviving a 
five-game thriller against University 
of the Pacific on March 7. The 30-28, 
27-30, 27-30, 30-27, 15-9 victory was 
the Tritons’ first over the Tigers in 
29 tries.

The match was an offensive show-
case, as four UCSD players finished 
with double-digit kills and fresh-
man setter Phil Bannan recorded 
66 assists. Sophomore outside hit-
ter Jason Spangler and sophomore 
opposite Frank Fritsch led the Triton 
offense with 25 and 21 kills, respec-
tively.

While the performance was 
admittedly not the team’s best this 
season, head coach Kevin Ring was 
satisfied with how his players han-
dled the pressure during the five-
game match. 

“We were missing a little bit of 
aggressive serving but we kept fight-
ing through it,” he said. “It was a 
high-level match with both teams hit-
ting at a high efficiency and our guys 
kept fighting regardless of the point 
in the game. It’s fun to go out and win 
no matter our opponent or record.” 

Neither team was able to gain 
any momentum in the first game, 
as the largest lead either held was 
three. The Tritons opened up a 
28-26 advantage after senior Russ 
Hardy’s block before Pacific closed 
the gap to one. But Spangler sent 
down the punctuation mark in kill 

UCSD’s conference win 
streak ends at seven 
games as the Tritons split 
a four-game series with 
Cal State Los Angeles.

Tennis Tops Gonzaga, Rollins 
to Finish Homestand at 3-2

By Neil Joshi
Staff Writer

MEN’S TENNIS — The Tritons host-
ed five matches over the last two weeks, 
easily blowing by Northern Arizona 
University 8-1 on March 2 before fall-
ing to Fresno Pacific University of the 
National Association of Intercollegiate 
Athletics by the same score on March 
4. Two days later, the Tritons lost an 
intense battle to Concordia University, 
also of the NAIA, by a 5-4 score. After 
that tough stretch, UCSD topped 
both Gonzaga University and Rollins 
College on March 11 and 12 by scores 
of 7-2 and 5-4, respectively.

The 3-2 homestand puts UCSD at 
an 8-4 overall record, but the Tritons 
still have an unblemished 3-0 mark 
in league play. All four of the Triton’s 

losses have come against teams from 
outside of Division II, a sign of the 
challenges their diverse schedule pres-
ents.

Head coach Eric Steidlmayer was 
disappointed with the consecutive 
losses, but remained positive, keeping 
things in perspective for his team. 

“Obviously, it’s difficult to lose a 
match when you’re blown out, but its 
more agonizing to lose those close 
calls,” he said. “But playing those nail-
biters will only help out in the long 
run. As disappointing as it is to lose, 
we know that we still have all of our 
goals in front of us, and we just have 
to continue to get better and compete 
hard in practice.”

SOFTBALL — During the middle of 
last week, the UCSD softball team 
was named the eigth best team in the 
nation, the highest top-25 ranking for 
the 2008 squad. The Tritons proved 
that the accolade was completely 
deserved and swept all four games 
of their weekend series with Sonoma 
State University. The Tritons utilized 
a combination of consistent hitting 
and stellar defense to back up their 
phenomenal starting pitching. Senior 
left-hander Melissa Ward and junior 
Lauren Chastain combined to throw 
all 28 innings over the weekend and 
only gave up three runs in that span.

The Tritons were given the high 

national ranking even though they 
dropped three of four games the 
previous weekend to Cal State San 
Bernardino. The series against the 
Coyotes was a frustrating one for the 
Tritons, as they were unable to achieve 
timely hitting and their normally 
immaculate pitching allowed 27 runs. 
Rather than dwell on the losses, how-
ever, UCSD showed its resilience and 
bounced back with four quality wins to 
regain its early season momentum.

“The four-game sweep was defi-
nitely much more uplifting than last 
weekend; we played really well,” head 
coach Patti Gerckens said. “We needed 
to win four and we won four.” 

In the series-opening game on 

A few weeks ago, faithful read-ers were rewarded for their loyalty with a glimpse into 
my baseball brain, which at this point 
in my life is far more insightful and 
educated than my academic brain. 
With senioritis in full effect, my 
schoolwork is fading into obscurity; 
but with baseball season around the 
corner and my fantasy drafts loom-
ing, I am prepared to build on last 

week’s National League predictions 
and follow through with my take 
on the American League, and, most 
importantly, how the postseason will 
unfold.

Let’s start with the AL East, 
home to the defending World Series 
champion Boston Red Sox and the 
Evil Empire of the Bronx Bombers. 
Since 2001, I have been ecstatic to 
see them spending more and more 
money without adding more rings. 
But as the Yankees get worse and 
worse, I am getting greedy and wait-
ing for the season when the Yankees 
miss the postseason outright. Last 
year was a tease, as New York over-
came a horrible start to capture the 

AL Divisions,
