By (HAILES NGUYEN 

News Editor 

In an effort to reduce the federal 
budget by $50 billion, a U.S_ House 
of Representatives committee has 
approved cuts to congressional stu-
dent financial aid for students that 
could make it the largest downsizing 
ever for student aid. 

The Education and Workforce 
committee approved, in a 22-19 
vote, to take approximately $14.5 
billion over five years &om higher 
education financial aid, which has 
spurred opposition &om IocaJ and 
national student groups. 

"We cannot have an entire gen-
eration of educated youth in debt," 
U.S. Student Association Vice 

President and fonner A.S. Presdient 
Jenn Pae stated in an e-mail. "This 
issue threatens the future of our 
generation and our country." 

Downsizing the benefits for stu-
dent borrowers will add unnecessary 
burdens to universities, Pae said_ 

Chancellor Marye Anne Fox and 
A.S. President Christopher Sweeten 
spoke out against the committee's 
vote in a USSA-sponsored press 
conference on Nov. 1 at Price 
Center Plaza. The committee's 
decision should incite a sense of 
urgency among srudents across the 
nation, said Fox, who is one of the 
few university chancellors in the

York banned from SRTV 
By MAn' L'HEUREUX 

Senior Staff Writer 

In response to the recent airing 
of pornography on tudent-Run 
Television, the A.S. Council has 
banned "Koala TV" producer and 
John Muir College seni r Steve 
York from the station's premjses 
and forbidden SRTV from further 
ajrings of any "Koala TV" mate-
rial. 

C iting the show's violation of 
the recently amended SRTV char-
ter, whjch bans "graphic depiction 
of sexual activi ty, including nudi-
ty," the council passed legislation 
to fonnally enforce the am end-
ment and denounce the porno-
graphic airing in a 17-0-1 vote. 

According to the bill , the SRTV 
managers are to "actively enforce 
[the] o rder of the council ," con-
trary to the content-neutral stance 
backed by SRTV co-Manager 
Andy Tess in the management's ' 
role in program production. 

"Under duress, the SRTV 
managers will comply wi th the 
bi ll passed by the A.S. Council," 
Tess sajd. 

York said his second porn air-
ing - feauturing the overlaid face 
of T hurgood Marshall College 
Senjor Senator Kate Pillon - did 
no t violate regulations because A. . 
President Christopher Sweeten 
had not fo rmally signed the nudity 
ban by the Oct. 27 broadcast. 

"Tha t is a moot point," 
A.S. Commis ioner of Student 
Advocacy T ravis ilva said at the 
Nov. 2 A. . Counci l meeting. 
Silva argued that the nudity pro-
hibition was technically adopted 
ea rlier thj month, during a spe-
cial council session on Oct . 23 _ 
H owever, several councilmembers 
had previously raised questions 
over the counstitutionali ty of the 
hastily arranged meeting. 

Silva also sponsored the most 
recent bill , which was borne o ut of 
Marshall senators' persona l ven-
detta against the Koala, accordiJlg 
to York. 

York added he has been seeking 
consul tation from evera l "high-
profi le" advocacy groups, in case 
he wishes to pursue legal action 
against the counci l. Such action 
may be at hand, with the council's 

decision to ban York and "Koala 
lV' mem bers from the station's 
premises. 

"The straw on the camel 's back 
has been broken," he sa id . 

Along with expelling York 
and his show, the bill also ga\'c 
Commjssioner of Srudent ' ervice~ 
1aurice J uniou the ultimate 

authority to enforce the lebrisla-
tion. III addition, the council cre-
ated an ad hoc task fo rce to " reas-
sess the SRTV purpose" as well 
as to revi e the ambiguities of 
the station 's charter rega rding ti,e 
manager's role in cen ori ng con-
tent. Ln its current form , the char-
ter dicta te that managers are to 
"[address] concerns and requests 
of di rectors, producer , adminjs-
tration and the student body," but 
no provision describes how this i 
to be done. 

The managerial role has been 
heavily debated in past council 
meetings, with member~ of both 
the council and RT\, di~cus ing 
how the tation's l11anagers are 
supposed to handle qllc~tions over

Black Dledical students still 
rare despite school efforts 

By YASHA SHAIIMA 
Contributing ~ 

Sixth College senior Joan Bianca 
Watson is a rare breed_ 

She is one of the few black 
students who are in the process of 
applying for admission to a medical 
school. Numbers released by the 
Association of American Medical 
Colleges show that, despite increas-
es in the number of Asian and 
Latino applicants for fall 2005, the 
number of black applicants saw a 
slight decline from last year. 

"Sometimes it is hard to find 
support systems that you need, 
especially for people who don't 

kno~ anyone who has been to col-
lege and don't know what to expect 
at college," Watson said. 

Despite efforts to increase the 
number of students from disad-
vantaged backgrmmds, the number 
of such students in the entering 
class of fall 2005 is approximately 
the satne as last year, according to 
Caroyln Kelly, dean of admissions 
at UCSD School of Medicine. 

"In the class entering in the 
fall of 2005, we have 16 students 
who self-identify as Hispanic, 
black or Native American," Kelly 
said. "That places the percentage 
of underrepresented minority stu-
dents in this class at about the 
national avenge_" 

MMC PresidentJordan Cohen 
said he was concerned about the 
lack of pro(p'tSS in the involvement 
of black applicants. 

"'The best evidence we have 
fOr why A&ican Americans arc not 

Gtea o.leiGuorrJion

has not seen an increase in black or Latino enrollment this academic year. 
applying in greater numbers to 
medical schools comes from focus 
groups and SUJ"YeYS that we've con-
ducted," he stated in an e-mail. 
"'The results indicate that the cost of 
medical education and the lepgth of 
time it takes to become fu1Iy trained 
as a doctor are major deterrents." 

The association speculates 
that black families arc generally 
less inclined to borrow substan-
tial amount of money, despite the 
attractive interest rates that are 
avaibble for medical students, 
Cohen said. 

"We hope to communicate 
more effi:ctively with prospective 
[black] students that an investment 
in a mcdicaI education is not only 
6nancialIy wise ... but can lead to a 
most fuI6lling career in a field with 

endless opportunities," he said_ 
Efforts to communicate with 

minorities are ongoing at UCSD as 
weU, according to Kelly. 

"The UCSD School of Medicine 
continues to have strong commu-
nity outreach programs that seek 
to increase the numbers of students 
from disadvantaged backgrounds 
who will have the preparation to 
be successful applicants to medical 
school," she said. 

However, Watson said she does 
not think enough efforts are being 
made, which led her and a few 
other students to develop their own 
outreach program, dubbed Hope, 
for underrepresented minorities 
pursuing health care professions.

Watson also said that the problem 
is not necessarily about enrollment 
figures and education, but health 
care in general. 

"With our community, there is a 
lot of disparity with health care," she 
said. "[The people) are not receiving 
the same health care as others, and 
we are not admitting students who 
have the passion to go bacIc. to their 
community to make changes or are 
aware of our culture and can com-
municate more with the people." 

The school must comply with 
Proposition 209, which prohibits the 
consideration of race and gender in 
admissions processes and has been a 
major factor in the dwindling minor-
ity numbers, according to Kelly. 

"The numbers of underrep-
resented minority students at the 
UCSD School of Medicine feU in 
the mid-I990s, after the decision 
to end affirmative-action programs," 
she said. "However, since that time, 
there has been an overall trend of 
increasing numbers of underrep-
resented minority applicants and 
matriculates at the UCSD School of 
Medicine." 

Watson said that, although she 
knew that the UC system does not 
allow affirma tive action, this was not 
one of the factors she was taking into 
consideration when deciding where 
to apply.

the cuts. 

"This is a very important chal-
lenge we are all facing: FOlI said. 
"Any effort that shifts the responsi-
bility &om the kderal government 
to the becks of students is not a 
prudent way to address the future. 
There is a challenge in affording 
higher education. but it must have 
access and affordability." 

The legislation entails a dou-
bling of 10an origination, &om 1.5 
percent to 3 percent, and would 
require a I-percent insurance 
guarantee for lendeR, according 
to Aaron Hunter, spokesman for 
Susan A. Davis (D-San Diego). 
For UCSD students, who cur-
rently don't pay the guarantee fee, 
the change could cost more than 
$700,000. 

However, Rep. John Boehner 
(R-Ohio), the committee's chair-
man, routed the bill as a "com-
mon sense" plan. The proposal not 
only reduces wasteful spending by 

reducing subsidies paid to lenders, 
but is, in general, fiscally respon-
sible, Boehner said. 

"This plan accomplishes two 
very important goals," Boehner 
stlIted in a press release. "It pre-
serves and expands critical student 
benefits while simultaneously gen-
erating savings in higher education 
by making programs more efficient 
and effective." 

The committee's vote was 
strictly divided along party lines, 
and drew sharp criticism from 
Democrats, who all voted against 
the bill. 

"We would not be here today if 
it weren't for the Bush administra-
tion's misplaced priorities and irre-
sponsible deficit-financed tax cuts," 
Rep. David Wu (D-Oregon) stated 
in a press release. 

Federal efforts should instead 
focus on increasing Pell grants and 
university accessibility, Wu said. 

According to Boehner, the 
committee's Democrats are hypo-

critical, as their short-tenn vision 
could endanger higher education 
in the furore. 

"Unfortunately, House 
Democrats have pushed fiscally 
irresponsible proposals that would 
actually weaken and dest3 bilize the 
programs and threaten our abil-
ity to provide college access in the 
future," he stlIted. "We cannot sim-
ply ignore the consequences of the 
policies we're creating today." 

No matter how careless reject-
ing the bill might seem, students 
have an obligation to do just that, 
according to Sweeten. 

"If this budget reconciliation 
was to pass, millions would be 
forced out of our system," he said. 
"Our door should always maintain 
a status of a public school, and we 
need to make sure the campus can 
meet the need of all students who 
are eligible."

She also apressed support for 
legislation before the council at 
the meeting, primarily an item that 
banned York and "Koala 'IV" from 
airing programs on Student-Run 
Television. Pillon added that, when 
it came to the question of the limits 
of &ee speech, the Supreme Coon 
does not support speech if it is ron-
sidcred obscene or a defamation of 
character. 

Accompanying the stricter 
demands 00 SRTV managers, the 
council also approved the creation 
of an ad hoc task force, which is 
designed to define the "purpose" 
for the station, establish a hierarchy 
of responsibility ofSRlV members 
to the A.S. Counci1 and rewrite and 
amend the charter by the cutoff 
date of week m of winter quarter. 
Several motions to amend the item 
were proposed, including the addi-
tion of two SRlV representatives to 
the task force designed to govern the 
future of their stlItion. 

SRTV: York decries 'hasty' council decision 
Items of Immediate 
Consideration 
(temA 

The bill, sponsored by 
Commissioner of Student Advocacy 
Travis Silva, formally denounced 
York and "Koala TV" for porno-
graphic broadcasts, and banned the 
show's staff from airing future pro-
grams or entering SRTV premises. 
Although, at past meetings, there 
has been a great deal of dissention 
regarding whether or not it was 
legal or constitutional to censor 
SRTV content, the council unani-
mouslyapproved the legislation in a 
17-0-1 VOte. It also delegated more 
responsibilities to SRlV co-man-

While several senators argued 
that it was &ir and necessary for 
SRlV to have a hand in its own 
enterprise, others responded that 
the stlItion officials could have an 
equally important role without 
the voting rights on the task force. 
Ultimately, the motion to include 
SRlV on the task force failed 2-16-
O. Unamended, the item passed in a 
17-1-0 vote.

Although the A.S. Council 
banned York and "Koala TV" 
from SRTV, they did not vote to 
limit SRlV from airing all live 
programs, as was proposed in a 
resolution by Eleanor Roosevelt 
College Senior Senator Ashton 
Iranfar. 

"Tomorrow, someone could 
walk into SRTV and air a tape 
of offensive material on their live 
show, and there is nothing in the 
charter stopping them," Iranfar 
said. 

However, the council tabled 
the resolution indefinitely, as well 
as a resolution condemning York 

and his Stevie Why Productions 
for not using prophylactics during 
the production of his video. 

While the possibility of "Koala 
TV" airing another pornographic 
show has been eliminated, York 
warns that the battle over censor-
ship on SRlV is not necessarily 
over. Pressure from administra-
tion and national media attention 
rushed the council into an unwise 
decision, York said. 

"1 wish I could make up the 
rules as I go along," he said. "This 
was hasty, to bring an item like 
this up and make a decision on it 
in one day."

Some initiatives, like sev-
eral on next week's baUot, 
are disingenuous, mislead-
ing and even unconstitu-
tional. They flaunt a veil 
of openness, but shoving 
something in front of unin-
formed citizens and asking 
them to vote on it doesn't 
make for real transparency. 

We urge voter to judge 
this batch of initiatives by 

WHAT IT DOES; 
Requires doctors to notify parents 
before performing abortions on 
minors. 

WHY WE OPPOSE IT: 
The measure includes too many 
"poison pills" - even for those 
who favor parental notices. 

N o maner what voters believe about abo r-tion or, more specifi-
cally, the importance of parental 
notice before minors ca n obtain 
one, Proposition 73 includes too 
many "poison pills" - in the 
form of riders largely unrelated 
to the main thrust of the mea-
sure - to make it tenable. 

Proponents of this initiative 
argue that their main goal is 
to get kids to talk to their par-
ents before te rminati ng their 
pregnancies. However, there 
is little reason to believe that 
Proposition 73 would be effec-
tive: More than 60 percent of 
pregnant minors in Californi a 
already ta lk to their parents and 
data from other states that have 
implemented parental -notice 
requirements do not suggest that 
their num bers are significantl y 
higher. 

On the other ~and, the mea-
sure does contain several par-
ticularly pernicious sections. 
The most well -known is the 
addition of language into the 
state constitution that would, 
for the first time, define abor-
tion as "the death of the unborn 
child, a child conceived but not 
yet born." Critics have pointed 
out that such language could 
set an anti-abortion precedent 
for courts, though this is only a 
small part of our worries. 

Other language in the ini-
tiative would subject doctors 

For example, limiting 
tenure to only qualified 
teachers is a great idea, 
but Proposition 74's inflex-
ibility and extended proba-
tionary period for teachers 
makes for bad policy. 

Fondness for the philo-
sophical principles on 
which these initiatives may 
be based does nothing to 
make up for their struc-
tural flaws. This year, all of 
the measure deselVe to be 
defeated. 

to lengthy annual reporting 
requirements, ostensibly so that 
the state can collect data on 
the number of minors who seek 
abortions. Though privacy con· 
cerns over this data are largely 
overblown, the additional paper-
work and red tape will only 
decrease the already meager 
ranks of doctors willing to help 
end unwanted pregnancies, for 
women of all ages. 

Most problematic are the 
details in the "judicial bypass· 
element of the measure, which 
would allow girls to go to judges, 
instead of their parents, to show 
that they are mature or that an 
abortion is in thei r best interest. 
Practical concerns ovcr access 
to courts aside, the measure 
reqnires each judge to report the 
number of such cases they hear 
each year, and how they rule. 

For judges, who in Ca lifornia 
mu~t stand for re-election, the 
pressure to rule against the appli-
cants would be great. We can 
imagine the negative campaign 
advertisements already: "Judge 
Smith ruled to kill 12 babies last 
year. Now he is asking for your 
vote ...• 

We agree wholeheartedly 
with the authors of Proposition 
73, who say that pregnancy deci-
sions should be made by patients, 
after consultation with their 
doctors and loved ones. This 
measure, though, only empow-
ers politician s and bureaucrats.

WHAT IT DOES: 
Attempts to make it easier to fire bad school 
teachers by extending the probationary period 
of employment from two to five years. 

Proposition 74's central point - that California has too many underperforming teachers and needs a more efficient mecha-
msm to get rid of them - is a valid one. 

But what remains of the measure is merely a 
single thrust of what was once a sprawling plan to 
address multiple aspects of the system, and as such, 
it could have as many negative effects as positive 
ones. The idea is that, by reducing job security, 
slackers would be discovered before they earn ten-
ure and would be tossed out early. 

Whether this would work as planned is doubt-
ful, especially since California seems to have a hard 
enough time attracting teachers as it is. Adding 
further disincentives (by delaying higher pay and 
security) for qualified applicants could make it even 

Long the sole shiner in San Diego's troubled city government, City Councilwoman Donna Frye is the best choice for a mayor that must 
lead the city out of its current malaise. From her 
earliest elected days, the activist-turned-council-
member, who refused to participate in closed-session 
meetings and perpetuate the status quo, has shown 

/ that she has the strength to institute a new culture at 
City Hall, one it badly needs. 

Frye's opponent Jerry Sanders is what you might 
caU the old San Diego's default candidate. His sup-
porters include the downtown business interests that 
encouraged the corrupt combination of apathy and 
greed that led to the current mess. These interests 
have donated titanic su ms to defeat Frye, whom they 
fear for her environmentalism at least as much as for 
her emphasis on social justice - twO crucial reasons 
she earns the support of this paper. 

But in addition to her progressive outlook on 
classic liberal issues like these, Frye comes with a 
hard-numbers take on reality that drives the prag-
matic approach of her plan for financial recovery. 
While too much attcntion in this race ha gone to 
the elusive numerical details of the two candidates' 
agendas. Frye's partnership with expert attorney Pat 

hea and her experience with the ugly day-to-day 
battles of the city as it is now gives her positions far 
more credibili ty than those of outsider Sanders. Her 
plan relies on the council handing her ignificant 
powers to reform city practices herself, holding the 
threat of bankruptcy over the heads of uncoopera-
tives. While it does rely on the fickJe City Council, 
its likely that it would feel pressure to act following 
the mandate of her election. And Sanders' plan 
seems to rely more on his own personal likea bility 
than hard-nosed reform. 

San Diego needs a leader who will finally nm 
it the way California's second-largest metropolis 
should be. \-Vhill! Frye's appealing frankness and 
idealism have gone largely unadvertised recently, 
they're still as reassuring and unusual as last year, 
when she almost won the post. Frye's years of expe-
rience have shaped her into the kind of visionary, 
pragmatic leader crus troubled town desperately 
needs. 

WHY WE OPPOSE IT; 
Bad teachers ought to get the boot, but not 
through the measure's clumsy language, which 
makes the profession considerably less 
attractive. 

harder. And why five years, when the vast major-
ity of states have a probationary period that lasts 
between two and three years? 

The measure's attempt to ease the firing pro-
cess of tenured teachers illustrates its fundamental 
sloppiness. To be thrown out, teachers would need 
two "unsatisfactory" evaluations one year apart, 
potentially making it more difficult to fire older 
and out-of-touch teachers who probably most 
deserve ousting. 

We can do better than this small, clumsy attempt 
at educational reform. Passed alone, Proposition 
74 is unlilrely to have a significantly positive effect. 
Because the measure could not be adjusted by the 

- Legislature once it passes, it could give students 
and adminjstrators headaches for years to come . 

THURSI),4,Y. NOVEWIIU 1. ZOOS 

When all else fails, try again. Supporters of Proposition 75 took the adage to heart when they put the mea-sure on the ballot, which would, in theory, diminish 
the power of public-employee uruons in Sacramento. Several 
other states have amempted to pass similar measures, but to 
no avail; union influence in those areas remains as strong as 
ever, with uruons using the cover of "issue advocacy" to con-
tinue political spending. 

The battle to pass "payched protection" against uruon 
bosses is hardly a "David-and-Goliath" match the governor 
would have us believe. 

Rather, the plan is a wasteful measure, as uruon employ-
ees, public and private, already have the right to opt out of 

F or vocal critics of Gov. Arnold SchwarLenegger-backed ballot initiatives, Proposition 76 is like Christmas in ovember: The measure has so many flaws, one must 
simply decide on which tring to pull to unravel the whole 
package. 

As Democrats have pointed our, passage of the measure 
- which aims to force California to "live within our means" 
- would threaten the tate's school-funding guarantee. 
While we would not be unhappy if the rigid formulas that 
determi ne state funding for schools disappeared, our biggest 
beefs lie elsewhere. 

Fir t, Propo ition 76 would impose a rigid spending cap 
on the state budget, taking away the flexibility of lawnlaker 
to make state spending reflect current needs and respond 
to unexpected emergencies. A similar cap in Colorado has 
proven so inflexible that vOtcrs arc now considering soften-
ing it; it has proven so deva tating to higher education that 
Colorado's public univer ities are actually considering going 
private. 

THE UCSD GlJ..\RDIAN 

WHAT IT DOES: 
Prohibits public-employH unions from using membership 
dues for political purposes without yearly wriHen 
permission of each employee. ...' 

WHY WE OPPOSE IT: 
The initiative is too narrow in 
scope to truly diuble union 
influence over legislation. 

paycheck politicking. While backers say the uuoaove WIll give 
public uruon employees that benefit of choice, there is noth-
ing that keeps them from I!lIcrcising the power now: Umon 
members that oppose political spending can simply elect uruon 
leaders of the same rnffid. 

In addition, specifically muzzling just the public unions is 
beyond disingenuous. There are many entities that funnel big 
money into politics, including corporations and non profits, 
which have been dubiously ignored in Proposition 75. 

Regardless of which group casts the largest shadow over the 
capital, it is evident, using other state legislation as examples, 
that Proposition 75 would do nothing to loosen the uruons 
stranglehold on politics. 

WHAT IT DOES: 
Changes California's buclset 
procetHS in hopes of eliminating 
structural deficits. 

WHY WE OPPOSE IT: 
Under the initiative, sIilte 
government would lose its key 
checks and balances. 

Most worrisome, though, are sections that would funda-
mentally change the balance of authority in sta te government, 
giving the governor broad clout that strips the Legislature of 
the power of holding the purse strings. In effect, the measure 
would allow governors to make urulateral budget cuts when 
state revenue drops significantly below projected levels; since 
governors are also the ones who make the projections in the 
first place, Proposition 76 would leave gubernatorial budget-
ing power largely unchecked. 

As Sacl'amento Bee columnist Daniel Weintraub - a luke-
wann Schwarzenegger ally- pointed out in July, the biggest 
institutional flaw in Califomia is a requirement that mandates 
two-thirds of the Legislarure to approve state spending plans; 
in most other states, a mere majority suffices. Proposition 76 
does little to fix this , instead giving a tiny group of lawmakers 
even more power to stall and block the state's entire budget. 

For Schwarlenegger critics, tile problems in Proposition 
76 may certainly be an early Christmas present. But if it 
passes, California wjIl get nothing more than lumps of coal. 

WHAT IT DOES: 
Gives a panel of three retired judges 
the power to redraw district boundaries. 

WHY WE OPPOSE IT: 
Though aHractive in theory, 
the measure is rushed and leaves too 
many questions unanswered. 

OPINION S 

L ike most reasonable Califorruans, we thillk there is much wrong with letting legislators sculpt their own electoral districts. However, backers of Proposition 
77 have failed to make the case that the situation is di re 
and urgent enough for voters to approve their vague and 
unsound proposal, instead of waiting for a more polished 
solution. 

If enacted, this measure would as.k three retired judges 
to hurriedly redraw district boundaries by the 2006 gen-
eral election using outdated population data, with the 
goal of rnaximi7.ing compacmess and contiguity. But 
limiting the focus to simply compact districts leaves out 
many equally weighty priorities, like the empowermp,nt 
of minority commullities and the maximization of com-
petitiveness; in fact, Proposition 77 actually prohibits the 
judges from explicitly considering these factors. 

The alternative to Proposition 77 is to simply let 
lawmakers do their jobs. Democrats in the Legislature 
have already signaled their willingness to compromise on 
an overhaul of how the state shapes its rustr ets' suggest-
ing that even if this initiative fa ils, the statuS quo will not 
prevail. The compromise would likely be superior to the 
current measure, as it would actually be vetted by policy 
experts and amended in the face of unexpected problems; 
neither avenue is open to ballot initiatives. 

But even if laWlnakers go back on their word, citizens 
would not be left out on the limb. California will need to 
redraw its district line after the 20 10 cen us, anyway, and 
if the result is a partisan genymander, voters can always 
reject it through a referendWll. 

The truth is, determining district boundaries is 3n 
inherently politiC'JI process that creates clear winners and 
losers, and no ballot measure will e\<er completely elimi-
nate the politics involved. Proposition 77, though , does a 
poorer job til an most alternatives.

Proposition 78 has no teeth. 
The £:itt that its chief proponents 
are pharmaceutical companies 
should be an immediate red flag 
for voters, and deservedly so. Yes, 
the measure would make certain 
uninsured, low-income individuals 
and families eligible for drug dis-
counts, but the drug companies' 
olrer of those discountl> would be 
entirely voluntary. With nothing 
to compel cooperation, the drug 
companies' pledge to discount 
drugs is disingenuous at best; what 
would be the businesses' incentive 
to volunteer to lose proSts?

The problem with this plan, 
however, is that any program 
linked to Medi-Cal is subject to 
approval by the federal govern-
ment. The current administration 
is unlikely to agree to any plan that 
deals a blow to the phannaceutical 
industry, one of its leading C2Jtl-
paigo conoibutors. If the reds do 
reject the plan, a legal headache 
will be the inevitable result. 

Adding to those legal woes is a 
vague provision that would allow 
Californians to sue pharmaceuti-
cal companies for selling a drug at 

The ultimate &w in any bal-
lot measure is that it permanently 
ties the hands of the legisla tors. 
Because of this, any changes 
necessary to these highly techni-
cal initiatives - and they will 
almost definitely require revi-
sions - can only be accomplished 
through more initiatives. It makes 
more sense to leave it up to the 
Legislature - replete with com-
mittees and eIperts who specialize 
in such topics - to pass a flexible 
alternative.

can voters stand a chance with it? 

Put forth by the Utility Reform 
Network, Proposition 80 was cre-
ated with California's deregulation 
disaster fresh in mind, but tries to 
address the problem in the wrong 
manner - by stifling competition 
and giving utility companies a hand-
out.

WAR MOVIE 
BY JAKE NARE 
STAFF WRITER 

Jartaead 

*** 

f; iS is Viemam music. Can't we get our own music?" yells Anthony 'Swoff' Swofford. played by Jake Gyllenhaal, 
over the blare of the Doors' "Break on 
Through." 

In Sam Mendes' new film "Jarhead," 
the comparisons to Viemam are end-
less. References to "The Deer Hunter" 
and "Apocalypse Now" pepper the film , 
including a great scene where the troops 
pump themselves up for battle by cheer-
ing and laughing as Robert DlIvall's 
choppers decimate a Vietnamese village 
to "Ride of the Valkyries." 

Like the soldiers in those two films, 
the troops of"J arhead" struggle to main-
tain their sanity. Unlike other war mov · 
jes, this one only has scattered instances 
of combat. As th e troops wander aim-
less ly through the desert protecting the 
oil fields of Saudi Arabia, it becomes 
more and more obvious that this battle is 
no Vietnam. 

Swoff is a third-generation enlistee 
who finds himself stuck in the desert heat 
with nothing to do, geared up for a con-
fli ct he doesn't really understand against 
an enemy he hardly ever sees. The first 
half follows him through military train-
ing as he excel as a sniper. There, he 
meets hi s superior Sgt. Sick, played con-
vincingly by Jamie Foxx.

plot. Like "Full Metal Jacket" - to 
which it wiU undoubtedly be compared 
- it is 1.00 percent character-driven. 
Thankfully, Swofrs unit is filled with 
a variety of characters, all with diverse 
attitudes toward the war. The support-
ing cast is a list of the next genera tion of 
fine actors. Each one perfectly fits their 
role, most noticeably Peter Sarsgaard, 
who plays Troy, Swoff's best friend and 
antithesis. Unlike Swoff, Troy seems not 
to care why they arc there, only that 
they are and that he 's ready to fight. But 
Sarsgaard's character is often complex 
and difficult to figure out. T le, along 
with Gyllanhaal and Foxx. keep the film 
interesting despite a very small amount 
of action. 

At one point in the film , soldiers stand 
around debating the reasons for the war 
until Troy ends the conversation by say-
ing, "To hell with politics. We're here 
now." To some extent, this is the rest of 
the movie's take on the underlying poli -

the writer and director are at times 
clearly trying to draw parallels between 
the movie's Operation Desert Storm and 
the current war in Iraq, "Jarhead" isn't 
overly political - though it may still be 
controversial. 

Semper fire: Peter Sarsgaard plays a dedicated Marine who 
doesn't care about politics, just his rifle and his buddies.

Sick, unlike Swoff, lives for battle

excellent job balancing a man that is torn 
between being a superior and a friend to

The contraband theater of 'Bus Stop' emerges from the shadows of the Cultural Revolution 
~ OMLEY AteaSON-

--Senior 5UIf !Miter 
her bumiag a suitcaK f1dI 
of hi.s manuscripts in the 
midst' of the Chinese cul-

tural revolution, then doing six 
years of hard field labor, Gao 
Xingjian entered the 1980s with 
a play that became the poster 
child of "bou rgeois decadence" 
to the Chinese Communist Party. 
A visiti ng student at the Central 
Drama Academy in Beijing saw 

this contraband piece of the-
ater and brought it .~ack to the 
United States. Her name is Carla 
ICirltwood and the play is known 
in EnsIish as -Bus Stop," which 
opens Ncw. 8 as the tint Chinese 
play UCSD Ius eftr presented. 

"Gao was focused on creat-
ing a .. . piece that addressed the 
political question, 'What did we 
do in the cultural revolution from 
1966 to 1976?' - and did it with 
an enormous sense of humor that 
confronted the audience with the 
question," director, translator and 

producer Kirkwood aaid. -This was

After 10 months of adapciaJ the 
Chinete tat into suitable English. 
Kirkwood presented Xingjian's 
play about eight people waiting at 
a bus stop. For 10 years, buses pass 
and never stop, and the characters 
negotiate what to do in terms of 
their need to get into the city. It 

bas been seen as anydUng from a

the show space during the play. 

Kirkwood saw Xingjian last year 
for the first time since 1983 - this 
time in Paris, as a Nobel Prize win-

Poetic, but lackluster 'Queen of Dreams' is 
jist the same old stOlJ of self -discovery 

By NEM SINGH 
Senior Staff Writer 

What cruel kanna had placed me in the care of the only two Indians who never mentioned the.ir homeland if they could 
help it?" 

And so begins the long lament that i 
"Queen of Dreams," Chitra Banerjee 
Divakaruni 's newest novel. Alternating 
between a mother and daughter's narratives, 
Divakaruni's late t oeuvre is a meditation on 
self-discovery, roots and coming to tenns 
with lifc. [ronically, the only lamentable part 
of the novel is th.at Divakaruni 's story fails 
to escape from the stereotypical umbrella of-
South-Asian immigrant literature that is so 
often marked by an identity crisis involving 
a problematic "American" self that ultimately 
finds its path to salvation by embracing the 
culture of one's "motherland." 

While "Queen of Dreams" is technically 
beautiful prose, the plot is too connived, and 
the characters too one-dimensional. Rakhi, 
the protagonist, is constantly haunted by her 
curiosity for any clues giving some insight 
into her mother, who was a professional 
dream interpreter. Yes, that's right - a profes-
sional dream interpreter. Reading the dream 
journals she finds after her mother's sudden, 
unexplained death, Rakhi starts getting some 
answers to questions she has always had, and 
formulates even more questions over recendy 
discovered incidents. Her personal life con-
sists of her ex-husband, their daughter. her 
father and her best friend, who is the token 
"Americanized" character. (Common in many 
South-Asian immigrant novels and usually 
displaying some cuggerated chancteristic.s 
- in this case, pink hair and multiple pierc-
ings - the "Americanized" character initially 
rejects anything South Asian, and ofim ends 
up doinJ a UK) by the end of the novd.) 

Remaining faithful to her writing style. 
Divalwuni brings in elements of mysticism. 
magic and mystery to the novel - further 
perpetuating the stereotype of the "aotic" 
land that is India. But writing a novel about 
dreams and using them as a lens through 

RFfIEW'II------

QUEEN OF DREAMS 
By CHITRA. DIVAKARUNI 

.. "l 'I. j\"; in 

which to interpret reality can be problem-
atic, as is illustrated ill this work. With tile 
discovery of the dream journal, many unex-
plainable, surreal things start happening in 
Rakhi's life - shadowy strangers materia lize 
in her Jjfe, doing good and possibly evil; an 
unexplained package prompts her to rethink 
her art; her mother's death defies explana-
tion. There is no [ine drawn between reality 
and dreams, which can be channing. as seen 
in Chagall's paintings, electro-pop, the latest 
French couture, or in whimsical literature 
- but which simply ends up being awkward 
in Divabruni's novel as she tries to grapple 
with "serious" issues such as death, identity 
and all the other complicated issut:S they give 
birth to. Rather than giving the novel a light 
touch, the framework of dreams ends up 
harshly contrasting the book's other themes. 

The last few chapters of the book discuss 
Sept. 11 and come as a complete surprise, 
since Divakaruni's critique of the event and 
racial implications that followed are not con-
sistent with the style and content of the rest 
of her novel. It almost seems as if she is oying 
desperately to fit in as many ideas as possible 
into "Queen of Dreams," but the weak plot 
and characters ultimately sag into a confus-
ing, ambiguous novel. That is not to say that 
there are not elements of sheer beauty in 
her work - constructing a novel around a 
protagonist who owns a tea shop and works 
as an artist in Berkeley almost guarantees 
creative. insightful and channing bits - and 
DivaIcaruni. an award-winning and highly 
published author, delivers beautifully. Yet for 
all those meditations on beauty and hope, the 
ultimate frustration of "Queen of Dreams" is 
that everything comes too conveniently -
journals with answers to nagging questions, 
random packages. mysterious strangers - as 
if life were only a simple dream.

Epitaph/ADA 

, he-ARTS 

S ubrlery may be an often-ignored skill - but the Constantines have seam lessly incorporated nuances into their third 
album, Tal/moment of Hearn, leaving a haunt-
ing melancholy to set in after its verscs. T he 
quintet distinguishes their music, a mixture 
of traditional rock and sub-pop, through 
their poignant lyrics (dedicated to the work-
ing class of nurses, conductors and hotline 
operators), with help from Bryan Webb's 
scratchy-yet-calming voice. 

While the album starts out strong, it 
does not have a very engaging beat, but uti-
lizes meticulously composed low-key melo-
dies. Doug McGregor's percussions do keep 

*** 
the rhythm afloar, bur between the blood-
pumping jolts of "Lizaveta," and the lasr 
song, "Windy Road," aided by Webb's voice 
and Steve Lambke's soft guitar, their erratic 
rhythms and droning mellow pauses drag 
down the second half of the CD. 

The Constantines' unpretentious album 
has many fine points but ir takes a patient 
ear to get through their humble art. So turn 
it up, listen to it twice. It won't make you 
cry, but it may make you wonder why you 
aren't.

Dreddy Kruler 
Wu-Tang Meets the Indie Culture 

?~~. ~?R .................................................... . 

From the churning sea of Wu-Tang affiliates emerges the multitalented Dreddy Kruger, who envisioned a project that would unite 
the cream of the underground hip-hop crop 
with their Wu-'Jang Clan forefathers, aU backed 
by RZA beats echoing his legendary mid-'90s 
SOlUld. The product explodes with talent and 
energy, but hlters slightly in the process of 
experimentation, 

RZAi; nostalgic production - helped by 
Bronze aZ3reth, Allah Mathematics, DJ 
Noize, and Preservation - is thumping and 
soul-drenched (though rinsed of its grittiness). 
GZA and Ras Kass share a mic for the unbeat-
able "Lyrical Swords," followed byoutstand-
ing perfOJ1l13nces from Vast Aire, MF Doom, 
Casual and Tragedy Khadafi, among others. 

***~ 
But with such an arrnyofconoibutors, a few 

misses are inevitable. Most notably, Del Tha 
Funkee Homosapien hits rod bottom with 
his pathetic excusc for a solo on "Fragments," 
and white she-rapper Uyata grasps desperately 
for some street cred, failing miserably. Such 
flops suggest that Kruger dug a little too deep, 
accentuating the absence of Clan authorities 
like Ghostfuce and Ma t.1 Killa, llowever, any 
weak links in the lyrical chain arc compen-
sated for by soljd, uplifting production and all 
abundance of raw, quatiry marerial - when 
W'il-Tong Meets the JruJie ClIlfurf, there's barely 
a dull moment to be had.

. Bus Stop: 
Undergrads 
give playa 
new ending 

continued from page 8 
She was drawn to Chinese the-

ater partially by Bertold Brecht's 
studies on Chinese acting and its 
style of alienation, as she was espe-
cially interested in alternative the-
ater and critiques of realism and 
epic work. T rue to this interest, at 
one point in "Bus Stop," the char-
acters disrobe, revealing the actors 
who then walk out, speaking to the 
audience as themselves. 

Kirkwood said that working 
with her cast and crew, mostly 
undergrads, has been very fruitful , 
with the actors even making their 
own ending. "I think my students 
created a much more existential 
ending than anybody would have 
ever thought ... and given who 
(rio is, 1 think he would enjoy 
that inventiveness," she said. "He 
leh that freedom for the director 
and the actor, and we're going to 
run with it. " 

The play is meant to be funny, 
but as Xingjian himself stated, 
"If people don't have this sense 
of humor, then it becomes an 
extremely serious matter, to the 
extent that the writer should be 
beaten up, killed or sent to a labor 
camp." 

For those not aligned with the 
Chinese Public Security Bureau 
and willing to see the comedy in 
a play with harp contemporary 
political value, get tickets to "Bus 
Stop" before the scats allocated in

Jarhead: Psychological war 
film is sparse on the action 

caruinw fram pa,e 8 
sion of attitudes toward the 
Marine Corps, even from those 
within it. Many Marines, espe-
cially those who fought in Desert 
Stonn, may very well despise the 
character's total disregard for 
their actions in the war. But 
"Jarhead" is an intense personal 
story based on the experiences 
of a man that lived through it. It 
can't easily be discarded as sim-

ply another anti-war tool. 
Mendes, director of 

"American Beauty" and "Road 
to Perdition," continues to 
impress by showing his affinity 
for bright, vivid color, even in 
the completely monochromat-
ic desert. With the fine acting 
and high amounts of humor, 
"Jarhead" is able to succeed 
despite a slow pace and the usual 
war film cliches.

that you can serve 135 miles per 
hour. Can you reaDy? 
F: Actually, 142. I can't do it too often 
and if it comes back, I'm screwed. 

G: When you were at UCSD, you 
played DMIion m teaniI. The 
Tritons have sioc:e been promoted 
to Dmsion U. Do you tbiok you 
would haft been rabIe to hmdIe 
die tousher c:ompetidclll1 
F: The good thing is I'm a bener 
tennis player now then I was in col-
lege because I'm smarter. But now I 
don't have the body. Now physically 
I couldn't do it. I couldn't decide on 
a one- or two-handed backhand, but 
I'm a lime more committed now. 
And in sports you need to commit to 
one strolr.e. You just have to pick one 
and maIr.e that your own. 

G: You wrote and oo-produced 
"Tennis, Anyone ... ?," 10 you haft 
obriousJy been involved since the 
start. Dac:ribe the procas you 
~ ~ turning this marie &om • 
!ICI1pt Into • film. 
F: I was doing a movie called "The 
Patriot" with Mel Gibson and I 
met Donal Logue, who co-wrote 
["Tennis, Anyone ... ?") with me and 
stars and directs in the movie. So, 
we met on UThe Patriot" and we 
both didn't have big parts. We were 
there for three months, so we had 
a lot of time to shoot the shit and 
have fun and we realized we were 
both from San Diego and that we 
both play tennis. So we just started 
thinlr.ing about two guys who would 
meet on a big movie where they 
were not doing much. So, we wrote 
about two friends who meet on a big 
movie and one of them comes back 
to Hollywood and becomes a big 
sitcom star and the other l'Ontinues 
teaching tennis. The movie is about 
me not wanting to teach tennis - it's 
about me wanting to be an actor. But 

it's really about finding what your 
true calling is. 

G: How much of the marie is 
buecl 011 truth? 
F: Most of it is pretty autobio-
graphical. I co-wrote "Pauly Shore is 
Dead" and I was in that with Pauly 
and that was pretty autobiographical 
for him. I've been in IS or 20 mov-
ies, but this was the first one where I 
got to star and really shine, because 
I'm usually the bad guy. 

G: Do you and DouaI play tamis 
often, and bow intenle are the 
pmes you play? 
F: There are so~ heated bames. 
We don't really play sets, but we can 
bash the ball together. His tennis 
improved greatly because as we were 
writing, we would take breaks and go 
up to his tennis court and play ten-
nis. I thinIr. that's one of the reasons 
it took so long to malte the movie; I 
think he wanted free tennis lessons. 
He loolr.s lilre a champion, but he just 
needs to play more. 

G: How often do you get to 
play tennis now? Do you play in 
celebrity tournaments or pmate 
pmes? 
F: Donal and I did a few tourna-
ments. I try and playa few times a 
week. I get out and swipe. I don't 
teach anymore, but I'D play with my 
agent whenever he wants. There are 
a few big directors that I still play 
with just so that they remember me. 
G: H you had the choice to sun: 
O\'U, would you become • tennis 
pro or a top Hollywood writer, 
actor or director? 
F: If I knew then what I know now, 
I would have trained completely 
difTerent[lyJ and I would have easily 
been a great tennis player, a profes-
sional. At the time, I didn't have 

the discipline, or a coach, or the 
repetition to do the same shot over 
and over. But I'd much rather be 
a professional athlete because with 
acting, you're still at the mercy of 
somebody else. At least with sports 
lilre tennis, it's you. You walce up, you 
grab your racket and you go out and 
you work your ass off and there's a 
good chance that you'll win. But in 
acting you can be the greatest actor 
in the world and you may never get 
to be in a movie. You are completely 
at the mercy of someone else, some-
one's mood. "That's why acting is the 
toughest thing in the world. 

G: 1Dere ... --= in the movie 
where Donal's c:hu:ac:ter tells you 
to gift up ac:ting because you're 
horrible. Have you fiu:ed that 
kind of criticism OIl your way to 
making it. an actor? 
F: As you get older and you realize 
you're not having any success, you 
have that conversation with yourself 
d2ily. I didn't get good at acting until 
about five years 180 and I had been in 
the business fur 10 years. When my 
dad died, I had to bee some things, 
and I became a better actor because 
I became more honest. So, in the 
last three years, I've become very 
grounded and a better actor. 

G: Is there mything else you want 
the students of UCSD to know 
about you or your movie? 
F: It's just a hilarious movie and I just 
want people to see it. One of the rea-
sons that I'm opening it in San Diego 
is because I grew up here. And it is 
showing at La Jolla Village, which is 
across the street from UCSD. [f you 
can get the movie to open pretty big, 
then the word can spread. So I'm 
just hoping that we can malte it a 
UCSD event and talr.e it from there. 
And if they don't like the movie, they 
can kick my ass.

Former Triton moves on to film 
Tennis star to show new movie near campus 

By RAIL ENIIEN 
Sports Editor 

With a movie set to run at 
Landmark Theatres La Jolla on 
Nov. II and a future sitcom with 
NBC in the works, Kirk Fox is 
a man on his way up. It's hard to 
believe that he got his start as a 
Triton tennis player in the 19805. 

Fox ditched a possible tennis 
career to pursue an acting dream 
and, urprisingly, it paid off. With 
a few small roles in big movies 
and some big 'Toles in small mov-
ies under his belt, Fox finally got a 
chance to actually star in one. And 
it wa his movie. Fox co-wrote and 
co-produced "l e nnis, Anyone .. .?," 
a story about "two friend who 
discover that in the world of celeb-
rit)' tennis, the battle are so bitter 
because the takes are so small," 
according to the movie po ·ter. 

Fox, who now re ides in Lo 
Angeles, came back to his old an 
Diego stomping grounds to see his 
movie and to grant the GIIDrdilm an 
exclusive interview. I met Fox at the 
Comedy Store in La Jolla, where 
Fox does stand-up occasionally. 
J Ie discussed his fond memorie of 

C ' D and the Triton tennis team 
and commented on his emi-auto-
biographical movie. 

GUllrdian: How did you end up 
atUCSD? 
Fox: I went to CSD because my 
sister did. I went to Mission Bay 
lligh chool and r kind of wanted 
to ~tay in town, ~o she helped me 
fill out the application to UCSD. 

G: How did playing tennis shape 
who you are today? 
F: I think having a spOrt is really 
important because it teaches you 
not just to compete. You also learn 
a lot about yourself as you're faced 
with si tuations. It was great to have 
a sport, to have someplace to go 
after school and have the camara-
derie of traveling with the team. 
Tennis has always been great for 
me. Tennis is what got me into 
the movie business. I was actually 
playing in a tennis tournament in 
Lawrence, Kan., when I met Matt 
Dillon. He was doing a movie out 

Courtesy Fox 
Pro fonn: UCSD alumnus Kirk Fox serves one up in his movie "Tennis, Anyone] 
Fox co-wrote and starred in the film, which opens at Landmark La Jolla on Nov. 11 . 
there called "Kansas" with Andrew 
McCarthy. We were staying at the 
same hotel and 1 became friends 
with Matt. I saw how much fun he 
was having as a movie star and how 
much fun I wasn't having losing the 
first round in all these tournaments. 
So J said, "I'd rather be an actor 
than a tennis player." So I just for-
got the rest of the tour and went to 
Hollywood and got my headshots 
and that's it. 

G: How sua:essfu) wen: you in 
tennis at UCSD? Did you hfie a 

sparkling career? 
F: I don't think there was much 
sParkling. I was a Little lazy but I 
did have a lot of fun. I played some 
singles and played some doubles. 
The highlight of my tennis career 
was when the coach of the team 
borrowed my car and crashed it. I 
won't mention who it was but that 
was a memorable experience on the 
tennis team. 

G: In the morie, you win a bet 

Nice guys always fi-nish last in NBA 
Bad seeds draw attention away from fundamental players 

no cup 
required 

Angie Lin 

I n one of the highlights of National Basketball Association history last season, 
the Indiana Pacer's Ron Arrest got 
into probably the worse brawl in 
NBA history - physically hurting 
fans, emotionally hurting play-
ers and tearing up Commissioner 
David Stem's reputation as the 
rest of the nation watched on. 
Arrest may have earned a season-
long suspension, but he carved 
himself a place in NBA history 
as one of the biggest bad asses of 
all time. And, ironically, instead 
of losing fans, Arrest earned him-
self legions of supporters wait-
ing for the next season to roll 
around. Forget that he averaged 
24.6 points or that he was voted 
the NBA's 2003-04 Defensive 
Player of the Year. Step aside 

Dennis Rodman, the NBA's got a 
new thug in town. What's wrong 
with the picture here? What hap-
pened to the good '01 players: 
Gary Payton, Scottie Pippen, or 
Hakeem Olajuwan, who played 
key roles on their teams, made 
their assists and shots, but never 
had a hardcore fan following 
because they chose not to be as 
exuberant as their teammates? 

Look at two of the top NBA 
players: Kobe Bryant and Allen 
Iverson, averaging 22 .4 and 27.5 
points, respectively, and com-
pare them to TIUl Duncan's 22.5 
points. It's amazing to thinlc of 
how many headlines Bryant and 
Iverson have made, but try to 
remember the last time you even 
read anything bad about Duncan. 
Unlike many of the NBA's badas-
ses, Duncan passes and will play 
in the Olympics without a fuss. 
However, most fans are unim-
pressed. I often hear, "Well, 
Duncan's boring to watch - he's 
too fundamental." Are you going 
to tell me that just because some-
one is so good and fundamentally 
sound at doing what he does that 

he's not worth watching? That's 
like telling me that Michael 
Jackson's so fundamentally good 
at singing th.at you're not going to 
listen to him anymore. 

It's sad to think that the golden 
era of "Old School Basketball" 
is coming to an end and we're 
welcoming in an age of new-
hies that have high averages only 
because they refuse to pass. I'd 
take a day of watching the 1993-
94 Championships (phoenix Suns 
vs. Chicago Bulls) over the 1999-
2000 Championships (Luers vs. 
Indiana Pacers) not because I hate 
the Lakers, but because that's 
when basketball was good. It 
wasn't just about Charles Barldey 
and Michael Jordan; there was 
KevinJohnson and BJ Armstrong. 
All of these players made you care 
and want to root for them because 
their star players made them key-
players by passing the ball. Sadly 
that's not the case anymore. 

The NBA is deviating from 
the fan-lovinS team sport it once 
was and turning into lone-man 
show interested in their own self-
interests and not yoan.

Golfers return from Maui 
after finishing in seventh 
Kramer, Leveillee lead with scores of 
219, 220, but Tritons fall to Stanislaus 

By LAUREN KATO 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD men's golf team 
traveled to paradise on Hawaii's 
Kohala Coast to participate in the 
Mauna Lani Intercollegiate, but 
finished a less-than-perfect seventh 
out of nine participating teams. 
The University of Hawaii at Hilo 
hosted the tournament on the Lani 
North Course, built on top of lava 
beds at the Mauna Lani Resort. 
Teams ftom around the country 
flew in for the event, playing two 
rounds on Oct. 31 and one more 
on Nov. I. 

The Triton found themselves 
in the middle of the field on the 
fir t day, accumula ting a team score 
of 299 on each of the two rounds. 
They came back strong on the sec-
ond day, shooting a round of 293, to 
6nish with a 27-over-par 891, good 
enough to finish for seventh place. 

The team from sixth-ranked Cal 
State Stanislaus finished first in the 
tournament overall, with rounds of 
292 and 286 on day one and 283 on 
the last day of competition to earn 
a score of 861, 3 under par. Close 
behind the 6rst-place finisher was 
Sonoma State University, trailing 
by only six strokes, with a final of 
867 in the tournament, after shoot-
ing rounds of 294, 284 and 289. 

The battle for third place 
ended in a tie between the host 
Vulcans and Western Washington 
University, with both teams racking 
up 879. The Vulcans finished with 
rounds of 285, 301 and 293; while 
Western Washington compiled 

rounds of 285, 303 and 29 1 in the 
tournament. Also finishing ahead 
of the Tritons were Notre Dame 
de Namur, in 6fth, with 881 , and 
Chico State in sixth, with 884. 

Senior Robbie Kramer emerged 
as the top Triton finisher in the 
tournament, earning a tie for 14th 
place out of 44 individuals. Kramer 
started off with rounds of 74 and 76 
but returned strong and shot a 69 
on the second day, 3 strokes under 
par, to finish with a 219 total. 

Sophomore Luke Leveille tied 
for 15th in the tournament and was 
the second-best Triton, with a 220 
overall. He began the tournament 
with a 77 and shot a 68 on his sec-
ond round, just one stroke off the 
top core of that day and the be t 
Triton outing of the tournament. 
On his second day, Leveille ea rned 
a 75 on the course. 

Senior Justin Grant took third 
on the Triton squad, 6nishing 29th 
overall , with rounds of 76, 80 and 
74. His overall score of 230 was just 
ahead of felJow senior Ryo Yamada's 
score of 231. Yamada tied sopho-
more teammate Chris Hirahatake, 
for 30th place. Yamada had rounds 
of 71, 84 and 75, while Hirahatake 
scored 77 and 75 on the first day 
and 79 on the second. 

The individual champion of 
the tournament, Tim Feen tra, 
was from fifth-ranked Western 
Washington University, and shot a 
210 in the tournament, 6 strokes 
under par for the course. 

T he Tritons will return to com-
pete on Feb.18-19 at the Battle at 
the Lake Tournament.
