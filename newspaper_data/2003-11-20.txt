TMC celebrates namesake 
Talk marks Brown decision anniversary 

Bill would scrutinize 
international studies 

By ANNIE YANG 
Contributing Writer 

Political science professor 
Peter Irons gave the keynote 
speech during Thurgood Marshall 
Week on ov. 18, speaking about 
hi new book "J im Crow's 
Children: The Broken Promise of 
the Brown Decision" in front of a 
crowded Price Center Ballroom. 

The lecture marked the 50th 
anniversary of the landmark 
Supreme Court Brown v. Board of 
Educatirm ruling, in which Justice 
Thurgood Mar hall played a piv-
otal role for the desegregation of 
the public school system. 

The main focus of Irons' 
speech was what he called "the 
silent reversal of the Brown deci-
sion by the upreme Court." 

Irons aid that the promise laid 
out in the 1954 verdict was broken 
only a year after, when states were 
allowed to desegregate at an "all-
deliberate speed," a term Irons 
finds to be an oxymoron. 

"We have returned to the Jim 
Crow laws today," Irons said .

Students protest at 
Regents meeting 

Protesters speak out against 
fee increases, enrollment caps 

By MARNETTE FEDERIS 
Associate News Editor 

1\venty UC D srudents 
joined about 200 to 300 rudents 
from all University of California 
campuse to protest at the UC 
Board of Regents meeting on 

ov. 19 at U LA. 
Among the issues that pro-

te ters raised included fee 
increases, enrollment caps and 
accessibility of the board mem-
bers to tudents . Protester al 0

approximately 9 a.m . t 1 p.m . for 
the meeting's fir t e i nand

srudents who participated in the 
protest, by the time of their 
arrival, there was no available 
seati ng during the public input 
portion of the open se ion, so 
the students had to reSOrt to mak-
ing their demand out ide of the 
building. 

"I think the major point that I 
got out of it wa that it was really 
hypocritical of the Regents 
be au.e they' re suppo cd to be 
working for us, but we had to be 
the ones to go there ," said 
Caroline ong, campus organiz-

Certain university professors 
may soon have to defend their cur-
ricula in front of a commi sion 
made up in part by CIA and other 
national securi ty agents, if a bill 
authored by Rep. Pete Hoekstra 
(R-Mich.) comes into effect. 

provision in H oekstra's legis-
lation, H .R. 3077 would require 
government-funded interna tional 
language and area programs to 
show that they include "diverse 
perspectives" and a " full range of 
views" before an International 
Higher Education Advisory Board. 

"We don't have any objection to 
have somebody looking over our 
shoulder to make sure that there is a 
wide range of ideas taught. What 
concerns us are the details," said 
David Leonard, . dean of 
International and Area Studies at 
UC Berkeley. "It's strange to call 
upon the CIA and other agencies to 
decide if a full range of views is being 
included. Their job is to present the 
public with views which are those of 
the CWTent administration." 

The bill applies to programs 

funded under Title VI of the Higher 
Education Act, which includes 
UCSD's Center for Iberian and 
Latin American Studies. With seven 
such centers at UC Berkeley, six at 
UCLA and many others, California 
has more goverrunent-funded sites 
than any other state, Leonard said. 

Hoekstra introduced the bill after 
witnesses testifying in Congress on 
June 19 criticized academia for 
undermining government policy -
specifically in the Middle East -
and national security. 

Professor Stanley Kurtz of 
Stanford University's Hoover 
Institute led the charge, claiming that 
Title VI-funded progruns "tend to 
purvey extreme and one-sided criti-
cisms of American foreign policy" and 
use materials containing "uniformity 
and extremist political bias." 

Charles Briggs, director of the 
Center for Iberian and Latin 
American Studies, disagreed. 

"The critics adopt a neo-conser-
vative strategy of taking one example 
of scholarly research, oversimpli fy-
ing its topics, erasing all of the stud-
ies that have critiqued and amended

Plans for trolley to run through 
UCSD approved by committee 

Route for light rail service would run next to 
Pepper Canyon Apts., go to Old Town 

By MARNET1E FEDERIS 
Associate News Editor 

The San Diego Association of 
Governments Transporution 
Committee gave the green light at 
its Nov. 14 meeting for a trolley 
line that would run from Old Town 
to the UCSD campus. The pro-
posed line will run north of the 
Pepper Canyon Aparunents, fol-
lowing another alignment at Voigt 
Drive, and extend to University 
Towne Center. The light rail tran-
sit line would transition to an 
alignment that will run parallel to 
Interstate 5. 

"This alignment would provide 
direct trips to the center of campus 
for UCSD students, faculty and 
staff, as well as service to both sides 
of campus," said Christine Rychel, 
project manager for the 
Metropolitan Transit and 
Development Board. "There 
would also be connections between 
campus and the community, partic-
ularly central University City at 
University Towne Center shop-
ping center." 

The proposed alignment is 
part of the Mid-Coast Light Rail 
Transit Project that will add a new 
II -mile line, scheduled to be com-
pleted by 2013. There are cur-
rently two options for the location 
of the East Campus station, 
including one on Voigt Drive 
adjacent to Scripps Memorial 
Hospital, and another located east 

of Campus Point Drive and Voigt 
Drive. 

Acting Chancellor Marsha 
Chandler, the Campus 
Community Planning 
Committee, the Associated 
Students and the Commuter 
Student Advisory Board support 
the line along with the commit-
tee's endorsement. 

" Our public transportation 
system in San Diego is 
nowhere close to being 

able to handle the current 
population, much less the 

, ted owth " prO}ec ~ ... 
- Jeremy 8am~ 

John Muir College senior 

According to Milton Phegley of 
the Campus Planning Office, stu-
dent population is likely to increase 
from 22,300 to 29,100 in the next 
IS years, making transportation a 
crucial issue. 

"Having the trolley will mean 
the possibility of greater housing 
opportunities for students, faculty 

and staff because of the ability to 
have access to other areas of the 
region," Phegley said. "The light 
rail will create a better linkage 
between the campus and the com-
munity, allowing greater access to 
the campus by community mem-
bers and allowing members of the 
UCSD community to participate 
more in community affairs." 

Costs for the project are esti-
mated to range from $638 million 
to $665 million and will depend 
on any variations of the align-
ment. Funding for the project 
comes from federal sources as 
well as funds from the TransNet 
sales ux. Since the TransNet tax 
will expire in 2008, a measure for 
a 30-year extension will be added 
to the 2004 November election 
ballot. 

"[f it passes, -then [San Diego:" 
Association of Governments) will 
be able to use TransNet funds for 
the local project share and possibly 
provide additional funding to 
accelerate the project schedule," 
Phegley said. 

Though the project was initial-
ly scheduled to be finished in 2013, 
SANDAG is studying different 
ways to advance the project's com-
pletion to 20 I O. 

"We are looking for ways to 
shave time off the schedule," 
Rychel said.

New 24-hour study 
areas proposed 
Tolin to UCAB: students 

need study facilities for fin als 
By CHRlmNE PAl 

Staff Writer 

The University Centers 
Advisory Board discussed a pro-
posal for additional 24-hour study 
facilities on campus at its Nov. 17 
meeting. 

A.S. Commissioner of 
Academic Affairs Todd Tolin pre-
sented his proposal to UCAB 
board members in hopes of open-
ing additional study facilities such 
as the Price Center food court for 
24 hours during finals week. 

"With CLJCS being so suc-
cessful and full to toul capacity, it 
can't accommodate students who 
want to use it," Tolin said. "What I 
really want to see is the Price 
Center food court to possibly be 
open, in addition to the [Price 
Center)Cove. " 

Currendy, CLICS and limited 
space in the Sun God Lounge and 
Price Center Gallery are the only 
24-hour study facilities available 
for students during the week of 
finals. Since the crowds at these 
locations are heightened during 
finals, Tolin said that there should 
be more options for students to 
turn to when they need to study. 

"From personal experience, 
study areas definitely get crowded 
up," UCAB Chair Justin Wtlliams 
said. "I can only imagine that it 
must get even more impacted dur-
ing finals week. Students would 
want an alternative place to study." 

John Muir College junior 
Kinneri Shah agreed. 

"There should be more study 
areas because it gets so crowded," 
Shah said. 

Will Parnell, an evening man-
ager for CLICS, said that its loca-
tion in Revelle is not ideal for 
study options late at night. 

"There needs to be more places 
for students to go," Parnell said. 
"Something more central, closer 
to Price Center, and bigger." 

However, there are certain 
issues to be taclJed if additional 
study lounges are to be opened. 
Director of University Centers 
Gary Ratcliff said that if the Price 

Cen~er food court were altered to 
become a 24-hour study area dur-
ing finals, additional "graveyard 
shifts" (or custodial and security 
service at the food court would be 
necessary. 

"The board is behind the idea, 
[but] there [are) maintenance of 
space and security issues so that 
students have a safe environment 
as well," Williams said. 

Ratcliff said that the presence 
of a community service officer is 
necessary at a facility that is open 
all night. 

"Just in case there isn't a good 
turnout, you want to be sure tha~ 
lcids who are there until 2 a.m. will 
be safe," Ratcliff said. 

The proposal is currently in the

W eeks after displacing Gray Davis in a his-toric recall election, 
California Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger was inau-
gurated on Nov. 17. After 
being sworn in and making 
Ills first address as gover-
nor, chwarzenegger 
repealed the $4 billion net 
increase of the vehicle 
license fee, making good on 
a promise made throughout 
hIS recall campaign. 

The spirit of fulfilling a 
promise to excise the car tax 
hike was noble indeed -
immediately lending credi-
bility to Arnold 's vow to 
reform the struggling state 
- but only time wIll tell 
how successful the action 
will be. With potential rev-
enue 10 t because of the 
repeal, chwarzenegger's 
team will have to draw up 
creative alternatives in order 
to era e the annual deficit 
and staggeri ng debt. 

One possible option that 
chwarzenegger's advisers 

have suggested is submit-
ting a $15 billion bond for 
vote in the March election. 
\¥hile this long-term bond 
will most likely cost the 
state $30 billion over 30 
years, it will most likely 
stabilize an education bud-
get that has already seen 
fee increases in colleges 
and cuts from kindergarten 
to kinetics research 
throughout the state's edu-
cation programs. 

In addition, it will also 
replace smaller bond issues 
made by Davis to cover ear-
lier budget gap that a court 
ruled illegal. 

Nonetheless, funding for 
education needs to be 
transformed into a pressing 
issue with Schwarzenegger. 
vVhile he made vague 
claims that educatton 
would be protected if he 
were governor, 

chwarzenegger must now 
specify how such a weep-
ing cfaim can be put into 
practice. 

Federal funding could 
be better applied 

C ongre s is currently considerin HR. 333, a bill ~at would 
give federal grants to univer-
sities with greater than 10 
percent Asian American or 
Pacific Islander enrollment. 

This bill is certainly 
attempting to address a real 
problem by relieving the 
strain on low-income fami-
lies attempting to send chil-
dren to college, but the bill 
is misguidea because it 
could be applied in a more 
useful way, 

The National Asian 
American Student 
Conference stated that "the 
U.. Department of 
Education is authorized to 
provide grants and assistance 
to historically black colle~es 
and universIties, Hispantc-
serving institutions, tribally 
controlled colleges and uru-
versities, and Afaskan native 
and native Hawaiian-serving 
i nsti tu tions, " 

Asian American face 
the struggles and issues 
that affect other ethnici-

ties . But the educational 
issues surrounding other 
minorities are not nece -
sarily the arne a those 
faced by Asian Americans. 
Historically black colleges 
formed in an era of egre-
gation are justified in 
receiving federal aid 
because of the political 
context that generated the 
formation of those in titu-
tions. Similarly, Hawaiian -
and Alaskan-serving insti-
tutions receive funding 
because sovereignty of 
land was lost to the United 

tates. The situation of 
these "Asian American 
institutions" cannot be 
equated to these scenarios. 

Although private orga-
nizations should be 
encouraged to make dona-
tions ana contributions to 
schools based on race, the 
federal government should 
attempt to assist low-
income students based on 
need rather than race, 
H.R. 333 does not accom-
pli h this .

Editor: 
We are writing to you because 

we are concerned about an inci-

We were passing through Library

and furious at a few college Stu-
dents. Mer stopping to see what 
the commotion was all about, we 
realized that he was upset after 
readlllg an article that had 
appeared in the most recent issue 
of Tht Koalll . 

The reader 's name is Gerald 
Tolbert, and he is th e Assistant 
Director of Student Affairs at the

"Continuing the continuing

appeared on the front of the 
newspaper. Mer flipping through 
it, we aw everal racist remarks 
and slanders that we could 
attribute to his rage. When 
Tolbert confronted the students 
distributing the issue, they acted 
as if they did not care. 

I n fact, one of the students 
from the Koalll said, "Freedom of 
peech is my con titutional right." 

When the police arrived, they 
immediately took Tolbert aside 
and began to question hun.

Napster makes a disgraceful return with RIAA approval 
Penn State students foot the bill for new file-sharing programs 

By BRIAN UIGA 
Staff Writer 

The Brand New Legal Napster 
(not to be confused with the Old 
Skanlcy Criminal Napster) has just 
been released amid a flurry of pub-
licity. The Recording lndustry 
Association of America wasted no 
time in proclaiming the coming of 
Napster 2.0 as the single greatest 
event in the history of the universe. 

Bur this is Napster, right? The 
bad little progTam that started all 
this file-swapping nonsense? The 
program that allowed legions of 
people wi th fast internet connec-
tions to illegally share the one good 
song off of any given album, there-
fore putting artists that couldn't 
create more than one worthwhile 
song out of business? 

Wrong. New Napster is basical-
ly a repackaged version of Apple 
Computer's popular iTunes (now 
with more advertisements!), where 
legions of people with fasl Internet 
connections send 99 cents to the 
RIM for every song downloaded. 
Its not a file -sharing program; it's a 
pay-for-play deal like the porno-
graphic movies at a hotel room. 

And this ncw Napster is su p-
posed to stop person-to-person (or 
" P2P") file-sharing networks like 
Kazaa, where everythi ng is free . At 
Icast, the Rlfu\ thinks so. These 
fine legIslators ::Ire already taking 
~tep~ ro ~ue c\'crybody they can 
find With illegal copies of J-Lo's lat-
est three-minute moan on their 
hard dri \ c, but apparcntly the 
U earch and destroy" tactic isn't 
working as planned. So the RL\A, 
in its infinite Wisdom, has decided 
to innatc Napster's corpsc to aid 
the cause. 

Here's a hint, guys. Repackaging 
the same old crap and calling it 
something else will only win you 
very stupid and very gullible con-
sumers, most of whom are not even 
close to the target audience of file-
sharers that the new Napster had in 
mind. These illegal downloaders are 
ruthless pirates with expensive com-
puters who are very, very cheap. If 
anything on the internet has a cost, 
they won't buy it. 

So, in terms of meeting a target 
audience halfway, the new Napster 
can be summed up as one of the 
worst ideas in the history of bad 
ideas which includes "Jurassic Park 
II" and "Jurassic Park III." (These 
particular movies are also prime 
examples of repackaging the same 
old crap to prey on the stupid and 
gullible.) In a perfect world, the 
new Napster would die a slow and 
painful death; lonely and unused 
while blatantly illegal P2P net-
works laugh in its little digital face. 

But we do not live in a perfect 
world, as evidenced by the exis-
tence of both "Jurassic Park" 
seq uels. 

No, the new apster has been 
given an extended lease on its entire-
ly wmecessalY life by the administra-
tion of Pennsylvar.ia State 
University, where aU srudems paying 
registration fees will be "given" a 
subscription to the ncw service, paid 
for by their networking fees. 

It is the hope of the RIAA and 
the univer ity administration that 
givlllg the kid their music for 
"free," not to mention legally, they 
will go off and continue legal 
downloading patterns once they 
leave the universilV. 

At first glance, 'despite the obvi-
ous gripe that money that should 

go to the university is being used to 
buy a computer program, this 
seems like a decent idea. Mer all, 
this halts congestion on Kazaa, 
everybody gets music for free, and 
both students and lawmakers are 
happy, right? Wrong again! 

Under the "Everybody Pays for 
New Napster" plan, all students are 
forced to pay for something that not 
everyone uses. Ths concept is noth-
ing new. Students are forced to pay 

" Repackaging the same 
old crap and calling it 

something else will only 
win you very stupid and 

very gullible 
consumers, " 

for srudent publications and srudent 
cable, and not everybody uses those. 

o why should the case be any dif-
ferent with the new Napster? 

Not everybody can use the new 
apster, for the new Napster sneers 

at any computer not running 
Windows 2000 or Windows XP. 
This Isn t a simple case of being 
barred from cable service because 
you have no television. If television 
were run like the new Nap ter, 
everybody without a To hiba-brand 
19-inch flat-screen IV would be 
Wlable to watch. 

We may set these faults aside, for 
mo t notoriously cheap file-sharers 
with expensive computers use PCs 
with the latest Windows operating 

system, and it's pretty cool for them 
to have their university pay for the 
ability to download MP3s for a 
music collection. Of course, this 
would only apply if PelUl State is 
paying for this "ability," which it is 
not in the strictest sense of the word. 

To understand why, we must ask: 
What's the use of an MP3? What 
makes MP3s more popular than the 
array of free radio stations on the 
internet (including UCSD's local 
misfit, KSDl) where you can play 
any song you want online for free? 

There are two answers: 
I. You can make CDs from MP3s 

and give them away or play them. 
2. MP3s can be kept in large 

collections so that you can brag to 
your nerd friends about the num-
ber of songs on your hard drive. 

New Napster can't do either of 
these thi ngs. 

Srudents are free to download as 
many songs as they want, but there is 
a charge if you want to burn a CD. 
And new Napster employs the glori-
ous method of "tethered download," 
which means you cannot keep the 
ongs after your tuition-paying days 

are over at Penn State. 
So, in effect, the university is 

paying for a service that mentions 
the name "MP3" but has none of 
the actual benefits of MP3s. It's 
kind of like the project car you have 
in your garage. It's the shell of a 
1963 Volkswagen, but it doesn't 
have a motOr, or paint, or any 
upholstery, but you cal l It a "car" 
out of convenience. 1\o1avbe the 
guys o\'er at Penn tate would like 
to lay down 20-grand for it. 

Despite what you think about 
the New apster, or software, or 
these funny tan boxes we call com-
puters, there is a greater issue here: 

DINING SERVICES NEEDS YOUR 

should student fees be used to sup-
port political ideologies that we, as 
students, disagTee with? Mer all, 
UCSD just went through a major 
administrative belch for its paid sup-
port of Proposition 54, an issue 
some students did not agTee with. 

Our student government is set 
up so that we, the students, are 
entitled to a pro-rated refund of 
our student fees if it funds anything 
controversial. Does this mean that 
anybody who does not support the 
new Napster is entitled to such a 
refund at Penn State? We cannot 
help but notice that a large number 
of college students support such 
file-sharing by engaging in it. 

The difference is that file-shar-
ing is illegal. But should universi-
ties fund alternatives to file-sharing 
instead of not encouraging the file-
sharing in the first place' Many 
colleges are already discouraging 
file sharing by increasing control 
over networks . Isn't that enough 
support for the battle against illegal 
downloads? These same chools do 
not support the illegal practice of 
smoking marijuana, but should 
they force every student to buy a 
pack o f gum or cigarettes in order 
to offer an "alternative"? 

Instead of offering the candy-
coated alternative of the new 
, apSter, Penn tate should save 
students' monev and allow them to 
deCIde which 'Iegal mu IC down-
loadlllg service they would like to 
use. This IS the way the free market 
works: consumers pay for products 
from which they will benefit. 

:-.1obodv will benefit from

alties from the other legal file- har-
ing programs. And let the srudcnts 
have control over their computers.

Obesity an issue of 
national importance 
Media misleads the 
overly eager public 

By MARIANNE MADDEN 
Senior Staff Writer 

When a KFC commercial flash-
es on the television and fried chick-
en is advertised as "being the cor-
nerstone of a healthy diet" and 
"containing only six grams of 
carbs," it's obvious that America 
has some catching up to do on 
what's healthy and what isn't. 

Six grams of fat would have 
been a decent selling point, but six 
grams of carbohydrates? 
Apparently, we're so ignorant 
about what is healthy that a food 
that is low in carbohydrates is mag-
ically good for us - never mind the 
amount of fat, odium, cholesterol, 
chemical additives, or lack of real 
nutrition. 

\,yhen we glean our informa-
tion abom what is healthy to eat 

" 

But concern over increasing rates 
of obesity run much deeper than 
failure to conform to a beauty 
ideal: Being massively overweight 
is a health risk that ean be easily 
controlled by real knowledge of 
what's healthy along with a little 
bit of discipline and restrai nt. 

The success of books like Eric 
Schlosser's "Fast Food Nation" is 
an encouraging sign that people are 
beginning to take some interest in 
what is finding its way into their 
stomachs. On the other hand, the 
Atkins diet - legitimate or not -
is in vogue right now, and many 
people are trying its basic low-carb, 
high-protein formula without 
bothering to research its finer 
points. People want an easy fix and 
the ability to lose 20 pound in two 
weeks, not a shift in lifestyle that 
might require them to cut down on 

KFC visits. from pseudo-scien-
ti fic diet books and 
KFC commercials, 
real i ty practically 
turns on its head. 
Then the dreary 
statistics hit u 
again : Americans 
are fat and getting 
fatter. 

all It a hunch, 
but eating KF 
isn't going to help 
anything except 
maybe it's bottom 
Itne. In fact, eating 
KF'C and the like 
are exactly what 
caused the problem 
in the fir t place. 

But concern over 
increasing rates of 
obesity run much 
deeper dum failure 

Consider the 
nutrition labels -
we all 1000w they 
e:d t , but how 
lIlany people read 
them? nd how 
many of tho e peo-
ple acntally under-
tand them or 

make dietary deCi-
sions based on the 
II1formation the} 
contain? 

to conform to a 
beauty ideal: Being 

massively overweight 
American 

demand that the 
Illformation be 
avaIlable, but then 
ignore it or shecp-

. health· k I) lSa ns ... 
It eems that American are 

polarizing in terms of body weight 
and how we deal with it: There are 
the Willowy health and fitness 
nuts, and then there are "the t3 -
tisrics," who are doomed to be 
overweight by genetics, the 
processed food industry, ignorance 
and so forth. The people in 
between seem to be rapidly disap-
pearing, pOSSibly because when 
Americans aren't gorging our-
selves with fattening, unhealthy 
junk food or starving ourselves 
With the newest fad diet, we have 
no idea what to cat. 

This is America, and American 
will endlessly defend the right to 
force a crash or fad diet instead of 
simply being educated about nutri-
tion and eating a balanced, varied 
diet. Americans will al 0 defend the 
right to have detailed nutrition 
labeling on food, even when we 
have very little idea wruch ingredi-
ents are healthy and which aren't 
(and further, have no reservations 
about shoving mass quantities of 
unpronounceable chemicals down 
our gullets). 

Ironica lly, in Europe, where 
nutrition labeling i n't compulso-
ry, people are much more picky 
about what they put in their 
mouths. Incidentally, Europeans 
have a lot more oppo ition to 
genetically modified foods than 
Americans do. 

lt 's also ironic that in America 
(where beauty ideal are slowly 
evolving, but arc till soundly 
grounded in being unnaturally 
thin,) that obe ity is most ram-
pant. 

That's not to ay that Amenca's 
beauty ideal i healthy - it' not, 
and obe ity i partly a paradoxica l 
effect of the pressure to be kinny. 

i hly realize thaI 
we have no idea how to use It. 

S far, much of the blame for 
Americans' obesity has been put 
on the fast food a nd processed 
food industries, which have, with -
out a doubt, revoluti onized 
American eating habIts and con-
tinue to have enormous influence 
over what people choose to eat. 
Blaming individuals for the state 
of their bodies has become politi-
cally incorrect. But putting all the 
blame on institutions completely 
ignore the 40 percent f 
Americans who, de~pite those 
KFC commercial>, the pull of junk 
food and the ease of a sede'ltary 
lifestyle, are not overweight. 

There's no reason why people 
in an industrialized , educated, 
wealthy cOllntry like America 
should be doomed to early deaths 
because of simple ignorance 
about what's healthy and what's 
Simply slick marketing or a pass-
ing fad . Furthermore, there's no 
reason why people should consid-
er even for a moment the illy 
claims like the one made on 
KFC's com mer ials. 

It's not hard to realize that 
something processed, breaded, pre-
served, fried and flavored with 
chemicals made in a laboratory is 
probably not good for you. It seems 
so obvious, but Americans just 
don't get it - we want to believe 
what we ee on television and be 
reassured that if it's cheap and deli -
cious, it's also somehow good for 
u . 

Until we face the factS about all 
dle garbage we put in our 111 uths, 
the obesity statistics are going to 
keep getting worse and our health 
care system will continue to be 
strained by e3 Ily preventable

Inri: CIA would be part of advisory board Marshall: Week features 
talk, meeting with Watson continued fTOm page J it, and then saying that this is how 

all scholars feel," Briggs said. 
Originally, Hoekstra's proposal 

ca lled for an advisory board to 
"annually monitor, appraise and 
evaluate the activities" of federal 
grant recipients, with the authori-
ty to produce "an evaluation of the 
performance of grantees," a move 
Briggs said would "limit all forms 
of scholarship at the university." 

Academic groups attacked the 
plan, arguing that it allowed the 
government to dictate curricula at 
univer ities that received funding. 

The most recent version of the 
bill scaled back the board's authori-
ty, limiting it to making recommen-
dations and advising Congress and 
other government agencies. 
However, it also provided that two 
out of seven of the board\; members 
would come from national security 
agencies and that the board would 
be able to receive information from 

all government agencies, including 
those collecting secret information. 

"Mter all, what's being evaluat-
ed are the things that are being 

presente~ to the public," Leonard 
sa.id. "Why do you need to see 
someone's intelligence file to see 
what they're teaching in the class? 
All they have to do is look at the 
syllabus and ask the students." 

Leonard and Geoffrey Garrett, 
vice provost and dean of UCLA\; 
International Institute, expressed 
their concerns in a joint article they 
submitted to the Los Angtlts Tmus, 
in which they urged changes to 
minimize the prospects for "witch 
hunts" by the advisory board. 

Last month, the House of 
Representatives' Education and 
Workforce Committee, which 
includes San Diego Rep. Susan 
Davis (D-Calif.), unanimously 
passed Hoekstra's bill, with the 
advi ory board provision. 

"Susan [Davisl didn't support 

[the board), but she is comfortable 
with the fact that it's merely an 
advisory committee and that it 
can't dictate or control any of the 
curriculum," Davis' press secretary 
Aaron Hunter said. "She felt that 
the [House) comrni ttee weaJcened 
the language enough that it did not 
draw her opposition to the bill." 

However, Briggs does not 
believe the changes made the pro-
posal more palatable. 

"It's the logic of the argument 
that\; wrong. It's an attempt to limit 
academic freedom," he said. "They 
chill the climate for scholarship 
and inquiry in the univer i ty as a 
whole. When political appointees 
attempt to regulate the centers of 
scholarship, I would worry." 

The legislation has been 
referred to the Senate, which 
Leonard hopes will maJce changes 
to the make up of the review com-
mission to include members from 
other branches of the government.

The week serves as a "home-
coming" for Marshall's core 
sequence of Dimensions of 
Culture, which centers on the 
issues of diversity, justice and imag-
ination. 

"Although we don't have foot-
ball, we do have Thurgood 
Marshall Week," Marshall Provost 
Cecil Lytle said. 

TMC Week continued on Nov. 
19 with "Up Close and Personal," 
which gave students the opportuni-
ty to meet with Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affairs Joseph W. Watson, 
the founding provost of Marshall 
college. 

Study: Students also request 24 .. hr. dining 
"I think [Irons' proposal] is one 

approach toward equalizing the 
educational system in the U .S." 
Earl Warren College senior Tri 
Nguyen said. 

TMC Week was scheduled to 
conti nue with the Day of Service 
with Jefferson Elementary 
School, but was changed to a 
community service event in coor-
dination with the Active 
Community at Marshall and 
Preuss School. Volunteers will 
make cards for victims of the San 
Diego area fires on Nov. 20 start-
ing at 10 a.m. at the Ocean View 
Lounge.

discussion stage until further stu-
dent feedback can be considered. 

"We don 't exactly know what 
the demand is yet," Williams said. 
"A.S. will be doing surveys about 
what other places [studentsl want 
to study in." 

In addition to conducting an 
online poll, Tolin is currently 
working on a comprehensive list 
in order to figure out what kind of 
study options students want. 

"The more people who vote and 
say what they want to see, the more 
likely it will happen," Tolin said. 

Tolin's proposal addresses srudy 
faciliry requests for students for the 
near future, but in the long run stu-

dents will eventually have access to 
a new 24-hour lounge that will be 
built into Price Center as construc-
tion of its expansion progresses in 
the next several years. 

"Twenty-four-hour lounge 
paces ... [were) highly requested 

by students in previous years," 
Williams said. "We also got 
requests for 24-hour food services 
as a top priority." 

Ratcliff said that along with the 
lounge, a computer lounge, a 
kitchen for commuters, lockers, 
group study rooms and a late-night 
restaurant are in the agenda. 

.. tudents keep really late 
hours compared to their predeces-
sors, which is why the expansion 

plan called for the 24-hour space," 
Ratcliff said. "The message came 
clear from urveys." 

Other topics discus ed at the 
UCAB meeting include the reno-
vated game room located on the 
second floor of Price Center, 
which opened to the public on 
Nov. 17 and features newly paint-
ed walls and seven new pool tables. 

Adjacent ro the game room will 
be a new Japanese restaurant that 
will have a sushi bar and dining 
area. There will also be a new food 
co-op area within the interior of 
the game room and restaurant. 
According to Ratcliff, both should 
be open to the public by January 
2004. 

Other students found his pro-
posal to be good in theory but not 
practical in reality. 

"I don't think giving money to 
the public school system is the way 
to do it," Marshall freshman j.c. 
Wick said. "The problem stems 
from [students' of colorl social 
realities. We need to rebuild their 
communities." 

Marshall freshman Amber 
Sears said Irons was an inspiring 
speaker. 

"1 think it\; good to see some-
one here at a public institution that 
understands and embraces the 
plight of minorities, especially 
African Americans," she said. 

In its second year, TMC Week 

Marshallpalooza ! will conclude 
the week on Nov. 21. Students 
will be given free food and the 
opportunity to participate in 
activities such as dunk tanks, 
obstacle courses and a Ferris 
wheel. 

There will be a talent show 
with UCSD students, and a con-
cert with three UCSD bands -
Straight No Chaser, Martin 
Storrow and Sunset Fiction -
and headliner oise Ratchet will 
close the night. Marshallpalooza! 
will begin at 2 p.m. at Marshall

THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY, NOVEMBER ZO, Z003 

Resolutions: Council resolves to 
oppose student fee increases 

Trolley: New ligh t rail transit 
system would open in year 2013 

contintU?d from page f 
student fee increases, the creation of stu-
dent-initiated programs to cut energy use by 
30 percent and water use by 10 percent at 
UC campuses, and the creation of programs 
to facilitate admission of minority and 
underprivileged students following the $33.3 
million cut from the University of 
California 's outreach budget for 2003-04. 

''If it's just UCSD thats advocating for 
new policies ... our voice by itself isn't very 
powerful," Eleanor Roosevelt College 
Sophomore Senaror Max Harrington said. 
"But if all ten campuses come together to 
suppon the agenda of our statewide organiza-
tion, which is UCSA, that makes us all the 
more powerful." 

With no discussion on the council floor, 
the re olution was adopted by consensus. 

The council postponed indefini tely a res-
olution in support of the UFCW strike at 
area supermarkets. 

Council members opposed to the re olu-
tion cited constituent concerns and a reluc-
tance to adopt a resolution that may not rep-
resent a majority of students at UCSD. 

Thurgood Marshall College Freshman 
sSnator Alan Haimowitz called the resolu-
tion "blatantly one-sided." 

MarshaIl Chair Travis Silva expressed 
concerns that passing a resolution in favor of 
the strike could alienate store managers and 
jeopardize donations the supermarkets make 
to UCSD organizations. 

"This is biting the hand that feeds this 
campus," Silva said. 

Proponents of the resolution pointed to 
worker's rights and the rising costs of health 
care as reason to suppon the strike. 

A vote to pull the item from committee in 
order to discuss it on the council floor failed, 
1-18-1. Consequently, the council adopted 
the Internal Committee's recommendation 
to postpone the resolution indefinitely. 

Debate on the resolution in support of 
Africa's right to health focused around the 
question of the council 's purpose in adopting 
the resolution. 

The resolution affirms the danger of the 
HIV and A.I.D.S. pandemic in Africa and 
calls on the U.S. government to commit at 
least SI5 billion to fight A.I.D.S. in Africa 
and suppon African governments' access to 
generic drugs. T he re olution also urge stu-
dents at UCSD to organize for a week of 
action in support of the fight against 
A.I.D.S. in Africa .. 

"This has nothing to do with UCSD," 
Vice President of Finance Eric Webster said. 
"We're condemning a virus here. This is 
about a virus. Of course everyone's against 
[AJ .D.S.]. " 

Other councilmembers supported the 
councils right to take positions on issues and 
the relevance of A.I.D.S. in Africa. 

"This concept that Africa has no bearing 
on us just blows my mind," ERC Chair 
David Goodwin said. "The point of this item 
... is to affect the lives of the students that are 
on campus who might find out about this 
and do further research on their own." 

Former Sixth College Council Chair 
Christopher Sweeten authored the resolution 
with the hope that it would draw students' 
attention to the A.I.D.S. crisis in Africa. 

"I hope that through this resolution peo-
ple will see the discrepancies within our 
social justice system in the world on who is 
receiving adequate relief from the virus and 
who is not, " Sweeten said. 

A vote to pull the item from committee 
failed, forcing the council to temporarily 
accept the Internal Committee's recommen-
dation to adopt the resolution. 

At Nandagopal's request, the council 
reconsidered the item and tabled it indefi-
nitely with a vote of 15-2-2. 

andagopal asked the council not to 
adopt the resolution because he felt that nei-
ther the supponers nor opponents of the 
resolution were happy with the outcome of 
the discussion. 

Ramer than "railroad something 
through," Nandagopal plans to continue to 
plan for a day of action and other A.I.D.S.-
related programming.

include a confirmation of the endorsement

19. The project will men enter preliminary 
planning, engineering and environmental 
documentation. According to Phegley, 
UCSD consultants will also be working on 
an updated University Center/Sixth College 
neighborhood plan. 

Rychel said there have been some con-
cerns regarding the project coming from 
the Lawrence Jewish Community Center. 

"The center has expressed concerns about 
traffic circulation, noise and vibration, and 

visual issues," Rychel said. 
However, for John Muir College senior 

Jeremy Bamberger, who partici pated in peti -
tions for commuter alternatives, the project 
is a desirable one. 

"Our public transportation system in San 
Diego is nowhere close to being able to 
handle the current population, much less 
the projected growth we are going to see 
here in the next 10 years," Bamberger said. 
"This will undoubtedly serve the students 
well , and it will get plenty of positive feed -
back as soon as the snldents know about it 
or start to use it."

THURSDAY, NOVEMBER ZO, ZOO) THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Author examines roles of 
By SARAH MAK 
Contributing Writer 

Every school had at least one. You know, the sluts, the tramps, the girls who would compliment the football 
team's, um ... ball skills. There was 
always the myth about the girl who 
would shag anything wim a pulse in a 30-
foot radius - or did she really? 

Is it any of our business whether she 
did or not? No. But, high school is a 
harsh place and to really make the most 
of it, there's nothing better than a bit of 
juicy gossip, according to "Fast Girls," by 
Emily White. White presents sociologi-
cal insight into me myth of the slut -
who she was, who she wasn 't, what the 
rumors said she supposedly did and how 
those rumors got started. White explores 
the truth about every woman who was 
unfortunate enough to become high 
school's favorite victi m - the slut. 

White's narrative begins as a vague, 
fuzzy memory of a girl who was dubbed a 
slut in White's high school. It then slow-
ly shapes into a a full-scale analysis of 
who the slut acmally is. Through inter-
views, conversations, correspondences 
and telephone calls wim women of all 
ages across the country who identified

~ REVIEW 

themselves as high school sluts, White 
delves into American culture in its most 
deprecating, self-destructive and sinister 
moments. Closely examining the slut 
archetype, White links the creation of 
the ongoing myth to society'S views 
toward sex and the role of women. 

After the Columbine High School 
shooting, me media bombarded the pub-
lic with the horrors of high school as full 
of severely divided diques. While every-
one (ook a few seconds to consider the 
consequences of the obsessive need to 
create cliques, there was little question-
ing of the slut as another one of society's 
manifestations. Amidst the division and 
the hormonal minefield, it's easy to single 
out the girl who developed earlier than 
her peers, who wears more makeup than 
others and who has more male friends 
than female friends. 

"Fast Girls" goes beyond an examin-
ing of the creation of the slut. It delves 
into the personal lives of high school 
"sluts", their experiences, if they have

been affected them and, more important-
ly, how and why the myth of the slut has 
been roaming high school corridors and 
locker rooms for decades. 

Whether you were the slut or part of 
the vicious rumor mill, the eX2mples pre-
sented in "Fast Girls" are all common in 
every high school and should be fairly 
recognizable. 

White's debut book is a fascinating 
and a troubling read. One can't help but 
feel a bit guilty and voyeuristic - after 
all, it is reading material about certain 
girls' most traumatic and private 
moments. While it may leave a few 
unanswered questions and is not up 
there with the likes of Simone de 
Beauvoir and bell hooks in terms of 
feminist theory, it is an insightful, 
thought-provoking read about a taboo 
subject.

It' tough being an acclaimed indie-rock band. First, you get support from smaller sources (in this case, Web sites hllp:IIW'UfU).pitchforl.71Itdia.com and http://allmusic.com) . 
Then, a major publication features your band in hopes that 
the masses will pay the slightest bit of altention. Then, the

you, calling you a sellout. Broken Social cene i a long way

'All the Great 
Books' crams 
the classics 

Serious lit critics 
may take issue 
with retelling 

By ANNE CONC-HUYEN 
Hiatus Editor

so how do you cram over 90 books into a two-hour theatrical charade? By leaving a whole lot out. But who really cares about accuracy if it's 
funny and gets people to the theater, right' 

That's exactly what the Reduced Shakespeare 
Company tries to do with its newest production , ~All 
the Great Books (abridged)," which is currently play-
ing at San Diego Repertory Theater. The popular 
company talc.es literary or historical classics, such as 
Shakespeare, and present them in a manner that even 
fans of the Farrelly Bromers can appreciate. 

~~_---=..:Th:.:...=.:ea=te~r ~ REVIEW 
In "All the Great Books (abridged)," the three-

man troupe (Michael Faulkner as Professor, Matthew 
Croke as Matt, and Jerry Kemion as Coach) attempts 
to take an absurd number of great titles, ranging from 
Homer's "The Diad" to James Joyce's "Ulysses," and 
shrink them into summaries that are humorously 
acted (complete with wigs, capes and hoop skins). 

The audience plays the pan of a remedial high 
school class and the butt of many jokes. In order to 
earn the credits needed to graduate, the audience 
receives a syllabus, takes midterm and even receives its 
"Reduced hakespeare Company Diploma." 

"This play is not recommended for people who 
suffer motion sickness, inner ear disorders, or litera-
ture degrees," the company warns for good reason in 
the program. Although it is an incredibly funny per-
formance, the show is a complete affront to anyone 
who has ever taken any of the books Ii ted in the syl-
labus seriously. While the performers do show respect 
to me authors and meir works, their perfonnances are 
anything but a faithful retelling. 

It may be amusing ro see the complete works of 
Charles Dickens translated into a five-minute soap 
opera with the title "Great Expectorations," but the 
company doesn't pay nearly enough credit to Dickens 
(or other authors for that matter). However some of 
meir kits do work, such a Coach's brilliant and 
enthusiastic explanation of the plot of Louisa May 
Alcott "Little Women" in the form of a footbaIl play. 

everal adaptations were extra-commendable, 
namely the rendition of Homer's "The Odyssey." A 
rather detailed account of dysseus' travels, thi por-
tion of the show i nearly the longest adaptation, sec-
ond only to Leo Tol toy "War and Peace." While 
Odysseus flies aroWld sporting a red cape and a blue 
T- hirt, he tries to extricate himself from the clutches 
of evil sedu tresses like Calypso (played by Croke in 3 
lovely bla k wig and grass kin), the R takes one of 
hi tory's most formidable pieces of literamre and 
makes it fun and approachable. 

The mo t enjoyable parts, however, were not the 
well-planned comedic moments but the bur ts of 
improvi ation and pop-culture references that inter-
rupted the how. Whether it wa by pulling mem-
bers of the audience onto the stage, spitting on them, 
or ba hing President Bu h, the company kept every-
one n their toes. 

Thi i not snobby meater. Instead, it' the type 
of productiun that an be enjoyed by any ne WIth a 
good ense of humor and a quick wit. Just dOll't go 
in with too much reveren e for the e w rks of liter-
ature, bc(:ause they'll end up reduced to hort lokes.

head-bobbing beats and 
some of Jay-Z 's better 
lyrics make this relea e one 
of his best. Jay-Z eliminated 
most of the empty lyrics that 

B c10ved indie rockers the Wrens return with their third album Tht 
Mtadowlands after seven 
years of relative silence. fe's a 
stunner, full of melodic 
hooks, dreamy guitar tex-

tingly downcast opening to 
an album full oflost love and 
lost opportunity, but the 
band doesn't waste your time 
with mere self-pity. The 
winningly epic "Happyn is

J ay-Z's style and flow are 
best seen on "My 1st Song," 
which has a jazzy, nostalgic

with lines like "ladies is

pected of "Jigga." 

Sadly, nothing on the

your attention, mainly 
because it is a sad goodbye

lyrics win points for Jay-Z's

max and levels off into joy-
ous pop-rock gesturing. 

Every direction seems 
both- well-planned and 
unpredictable. Diverse songs 
such as the folksy "She Sends 
Kisses," the gritty guitar 
romp "Per Second Second" 
and the silvery "llis Boy Is 
Exhausted" create a vast 
soundscape that satisfies 
upon repeated plays. 

The Wrens occasionally 
sound too sensitive for their 
own good, and the singing 
isn't very distinctive. But 
when it comes down to it, it's 
not that the band is really 
that distinctive at all: It's just 
exceptionally good at doing 
what it does.

immense crossover appeal and 
could easily get any girl to sweat 
over an Asian guy, is playing in 
fewer than 10 cities nationwide. 

Other than the lovely 
Kaneshiro, it is an interesting 
phenomenon to see Asian men 
depicted as superb athletes with 
very little sex appeal. For example, 
compare Chinese superstars Chan 
and Li to American action heroes 
Vin Diesel or Ben Affleck. r don't 
think I can remember any movie 
scene where either Chan or Li 
pull any woman into a passionate 
embrace. Yet Vin Diesel pulls Asia 
Argento into one ("XXX"), in 

which she looks like she'll get 
crllshed by his massive biceps. 

While Asian men hardly get 
any play in film, Asian women get 
more than plenty. As the Asian 
man becomes asexual, the Asian 
woman becomes hypersexual. One 
major example of this is Lucy Liu. 
In nearly every single one of her 
roles, she depicts the quintessen-
tial dragon lady. Her characters 
are nearly always seductive and 
often dangerous, like in "Charlie's 
Angels," "Kill BiII ~ or even 
"Chicago." But this image of the 
sexually available Asian female 
was already cemented in the 
American collective memory 

through other fi lms like "The 
World of Suzie Wong," "Heaven 
and Earth" and even "Apocalypse

like "The Joy Luck Club," 
"Double Happiness" and the work 
of Gurinder Chad ha and Mi ra 
Nair, but there are others that, 
sadly, perpetuate the stereotype 
about Asian-American women. In 
the recent Asian-American indie 
film "Charlotte Sometimes," the 
two Asian-American women are 
highly sexual bei ngs. One is a 
highly complex and enigmatic 
dragon lady while the other is 
oversexed and insipid, with an

llIURSDAY, NOVEMBER ZOo 2003 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

'Orphans' outshines the typical dramedy 
New Viilage Arts struts its stuff with deft genre mix 

By BRIAN UIGA 
Staff Writer 

It has become the norm in theater these days to play for a mass audi-ence and include "something for 
everyone" in every show. The result 
is a whole lot of unfunny "comic dra-
mas" or wishy-washy "dramatic 
comedies" running aroWld. Sadly, 
the perfonnances in these worlcs play 
the middle ground while often-great 
scripts are reduced to nothing more 
than empty lines delivered by a 
smirking entourage. 

For instance, consider 
"Orphans," by Lyle Kessler. It's an 
interesting little script, with a dash 
or two of comedy in it and a dash or 
two of drama. Given any nwnber of 
possible directions, "Orphans" could 
easily be a comfortable little evening 
for a mass audience. 

With New Village Arts' edgy 
troupe, "Orphans" becomes a 
delightfully savage dramedy, spitting 
and snarling its way through the 
story of orphaned brothers Phillip 
and Treat as they attempt to survive 
in a dilapidated Philadelphia apart-
ment. It's excruciatingly funny and 
dramatic, and there's no smirking or 
whining to ruin the mood. The great 
thing is that it still has quite a bit of 
mass appeal while being about as 
"comfortable" as the Spanish 
Inquisition.

ous and deeply disturbing. 
Wonderfully rounding out the 
three-man cast is Jim Chovick as 
Harold, an old businessman and 
Treat's kidnap "victim" who has the 
uncanny ability to switch between 
Santa and Satan in the blink of an 
eye. 

Under director Kristianne 

and the three performers often sum-
mon huge laughs ITom the audience 
without saying a word. 

To add to the experience, 
"Orphans" is staged at the corpo-
rate headquarters of Jau.ercise, a 
surreal location filled with s~arthy 
corporate architecture and spandex 
exercise clothing that just happens 
to have a theater tucked away in the 
back of the building. 

The drama is hard-hitting and 
the comedy is so infectious that 
people almost keeled over in their 
seats. Altogether, everything adds 
up to a show so simply wonderful 
that its brilliance transcends 
description.

temper and tendency toward vio-
lence is both laugh-out-Ioud hilari-

Kessler's considerable craftsmanship, 
this play starts with a bang. The 
audience sees Phillip and Treat

'Another American' is a one-man thrill 
Emotional exploration of Idon't ask, don't tell' policy 

By NEM SINGH 
Staff Writer 

It is normal to have second thoughts when asked to see a one-man show with 18 charac-
ters. It reeks of a crazy actor caught 
up in long, self-involved mono-
logues. However, the Diversionary 
Theater's latest production, 
"Another American: Asking and 
Telling," which explores the "don't 
ask, don't tell" policy in the 
American military, is surprisingly 
entertaining and draws in the audi-
ence through various characters, 
who range from being heartbreak-
ing to hilarious - often at the same 
time. 

Playwright Marc Wolf spent 
three year traveling across 
America and interviewing many 
people, including gay and lesbian 
military personnel, federal judges, 
civil rights lawyers, veterans of var-
ious wars, politicians, activists and 
professors of sociology, con titu-

tional law and military history. The 
interviews were taped, transcribed 
and then edi ted into monologues 
using each person's own words to 
construct the text for the play. His 
play succeeds in cutting into the 
individuals' words at that moment 
when they most cogently learned 
something about themselves. At 
that point, they become characters, 
speaki ng the unvarnished truth -
and, in the case of "Another 
American," bringing new insight 
into the psychological cost of 
silence to individuals and to the 
country they serve. 

Actor, Russell Garrett delivers a 
brilliant performance. Two hours of 
solid monologues would tire any 
actor out, but he manages to solidly 
perform. A very minimalist set, 

including a glass of water, a desk and 
a chair, brings even more focus to 
the different characters Garrett por-
trays. He has a very natural way of 
portraying the numerous characters, 
managing to morph effortlessly from 
a Southern beUe to a soft- poken 
marine to a screaming lawyer. This 
ease lets the audience forget that 
there is only one person on the stage. 
After a whi le, each of the characters 
become so separate it seems as if 
there were 18 di fferent actors. The 
play's success lies in this ability to 
pull off such a difficult accomplish-
ment. 

This play is a mu t-see if you are 
in the mood for something heavier 
than the latest Hollywood comedy. 
WoIrs script manages to bring a 
contentious, if suppressed, issue to 
light and serves as a blueprint for a 
lively and emotional evening of 
theater. Tickets are available for 
$20 through the Diversionary 
Theater box office at (619) 220-
0097 . 

UCSD gospel choir to serenade Revelle Plaza 
Choir perseveres despite practices delayed by fires and holidays 

By CLARE LEWIS 
Contributing W'iter 

The UCSD gospel choir, which sings a variety of traditional spirirual anthems as well as cia -
sic and contemporary gospel songs, 
performed its fir t fall concert on 

ov. I at Mandeville Auditorium 
and will perform again at Revelle 
Plaza on Nov. 20. 

Going into its 34th year, the 
choir has over 300 members in four-
part harmony. It is split into two sec-
tions and each section meets twice a 
week. Before the concerts, the choir 
meets as a whole to rehearse. 
However, according to choir leader 

Ken Anderson, the gospel choir has 
faced several obstacles. 

"This year ha been harder 
because we missed a few session 
with the fires and holidays, so the 
concerts will be less prepared, but 
it'U be fun," he said . 

Anderson allows anyone to join 
and requires only an informal group 
audition in which he places each 
voice in one of the four parts. He 
teaches songs by singing them aloud, 
with the choir singing each part back 
rather than through written music 
and lyrics. 

Similarly, the choir rehearses 
without the soloists, often singing 
background harmonies until the 

soloists arrive on the day of the con-
cert. All soloists are either part of the 
university choir or from the commu-
nity. 

Although students can receive 
credit for joining, a lot of people join 
for fun. 

"1 think Ken 's hilarious and 
gospel choir gives you a chance to 
really enjoy music - you're clap-
ping and just making mu ic from 
scratch," Thurgood Marshall 
College senior unny Parisi said. 

Whether for religious enjoy-
ment, the energetic ambience or just 
the harmonious music, the gospel 
choir presents an impressive and 
enthusiastic performance.

Swimming split against CSUB 
UCSD women win, 187-112; men fall, 189.5-102.5 

David UngJGoordion file 
Run over: Aga inst the defending Division 1\ national champion Roadrunners, 
the UCSD men's swimming and diving team claimed three first-place fin ishes. 

By EVA HOFFMAN 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD swimming and 
diving teams competed again t 
their CM Division n rival Cal 

tate Bakersfield at Hillman 
Aquatic Cemer in Bakersfield, 
Calif., on oV. IS. The UC D 
women won, 187- 11 2, while the 
men lost, 189.5- 102.5. 

The women, who have been 
acqui ring NCAA qualification 
consistently since the Slart of the 
season, continued the trend by 
earning two automatic qualifica-
tions and IS consideration qualifi-
cations against Baker fi eld. They 
furth er demonstrated their 
strength by winning nine out of 16 
events. 

Freshman usan Bell wa the 
only CS D Wlillmer to win two 
Indn'iuual events. She placed first 
III the lOO-yard backSlToke (two 
minutes anu 9.77 seconds) and the 
ZOO-ya ru individua l med ley 
(2 : 11.73), earn ing I CAA con id-
cration qualifica tions in both 
events . 

Other first-place swims that 

earned at least a consideration 
qualification were senior Denise 
Bogard's 100-yard breaststroke 
(I :06.70), junior Frances Tran's 
200-yard butterfly (2 :09 .89), 
freshman Emily I lar lan's 100-yard 
freestyle (52 .16), junior Rosanna 
Delurgio's 200-yard breaststroke 
(2 :21.88) and sophomore Sophie 
Levy's 500-yard freestyle 
(5:07.47). 

Senior Carolyn Kwok, the 
women's co-captain, expre sed 
happiness that the team overcame 
challenges such as freezing weath-
er and recently lightened training 
in preparation for an upcoming 
meet. 

"Considering the weather con-
di nons, everyone did a great job," 
Kwok said. " Plus, we're in the 
middle of our taper for the peedo 
Cup next weekend. So everyone 
was feeling a littl e weird in the 
water. .. 

T he UCSD men's team faced 
an additional challenge . the 
Roadrunners swimmers have been 

CAA Division n national cham-
pions several time in recent years. 
Although the UCSD men lost, 

they did not allow Cal Sta te 
Bakersfield to dominate the meet. 
UCSD claimed three out of 16 
first places. 

Event winner for the men 
were freshman Aram Yoo in the 
100-yard backstroke (53 .00), 
junior Brett Going in the 100-
yard breaststroke (58 .73) and 
freshman Jacob Dong in the 200-
yard breaststroke (2 : I 0.21). 
Going's swim was one of two 
NCAA consideration qualifica-
tions for the men; the other was 
freshman Mike Lahey's second-
place 200-yard backstroke 
(I :54.85). 

Triton head coach Scott 
McGihon commented on Going's 
swim, saying that his strong lead 
from the start of the race to its fin-
ish was impressive. McGihon also 
identified Brady Gosling' 200-
yard freestyle (1 :46.92) as an out-
standing swim because he 
approached it aggre sively. 

The UCSD divers also partici-
pated in the meet. Sophomore 
Jenny Margrave earned second 
place in 3-meter diving. Junior 
Ashley Vogel came in third on the 
I-meter board and the 3 -meter 
board. For the men, Dan Grodh 
placed second on both boards. 

Overall, the swimmers and the 
divers had solid performances 
against the Roadrunners, despi te 
the fac t that their training and 
thoughts have been focused on the 
approaching Speedo Cup, which 
is the biggest an d most important 
meet of the fall. 

" \ Ve're hoping to get more 
people qualified fo r nationals at 
the Speedo Cup. Everyone's very 
excIted about this meet," Kwok 
said. 

The U SO teams will be in 
Long Beach, Ca lif., for the 
peeuo Cup on l ov. 20 to Nov. 

22 .

"We practiced penalty kicks 
more this year," Mendoza said. She 
was the crucial fifth shooter for the 
TritOI1$, who were without her last 
year in the UC Davis game due to 
injury. 

Regulation time saw the two 
teams each come up with scoring 
threats, but neither was able to 
record a goal. UCSD out-shot the 
Toros, 22 - 12, but scoring chances 
were virtually even. Senior Kristin 
Jones and Cochran led UCSD in 
shots with seven and four, respec-
tively. Despite the high shot counts 
and Cochran 's constant knifing 
through Toro defenders, the Toros 

didn't provide many golden oppor-
tunities for UCSD. 

"We wanted to double them a lit-
tle more than we did in the past," 
Flanagan said. "That was our game 
plan, to try and stop their two main 
guns." 

Garcia was also a big factor in the 
shutout. The Cal State Domingue-l: 
Hills keeper came up with nine 
saves. 

UCSD will now play host in the 
quarterfinals to Metro State of 
Denver in the National 
Quarterfinals on Nov. 23 . Metro 
State is the Midwest Region'S top 
seed and is currently ranked num-
ber one in the nation.

WWPA: UCSD aims for 14th WWPA title 
contintud from page ~o 

Matt Ellis said. "They are the only 
team in the WWPA that we haven 't 
faced yet this year." 

The No. 17 Falcons are seeded 
third behind LMU, giving them a 
strong chance of making it to the 
final game. 

Regardless, the Tritons' two 
toughest opponents will likely have 
to face each other before they are 
given any shot at UCSD. 

The Tritons have started the 
transition from their regular sea-
son practices into a more lax regi-
men to enable them to perform at 
their peak in the upcoming play-
offs. 

"We've started to taper a little. 
Everyone's just getting relaxed this 
week," Petersen said. "We have put 
a lot of work into our six-on-five 
defense and offense as well as on 
our counterattacks." 

A key focus for UCSD will be 
coming out strong. The Tritons 
proved that their chance of victory 
is more than doubled when they 
win the first quarter. The coun-

terattack will be essential in mov-
ing ahead in the tournament by 
capitalizing on slower teams' 
weaknesses. 

"We have got to defend our 
crown," Petersen said. "This will 
be the 14th WWPA title for 
[UCSD] ." 

This weekend there will be 
seven tearns in the W\¥PA confer-
ence nipping at the heels of the 
top-seeded Tritons. Five of these 
teams are ranked in the most recent 
NCAA top-20 poll. 

"We know what the deal is," 
junior driver Nate Cooper said. "If 
we win [the WWPA], then we go 
to NCAAs. If we lose, our season is 
over. That's it." 

Should the Tritons win all 
three of their games, they will be 
seeded third at the NCAA 
Championship on the weekend of 
Dec. 6. 

For now, the Tritons are five 
arduous games away from their 
first national title at the Division II 
level.

Men's soccer earns honors 
Five Tritons receive CCAA recognition 
By CYNTHIA CHAVEl 

Sports Editor 
The California Collegiate 

Athletic Association head coaches 
honored five UCSD men's soccer 
players for their performances this 
season and for helping the Tritons 
earn a wild card slot in the CCAA 
playoffs and reach the Division II 
NCAA Far West Region semifinals 
for the first time. 

The voters gave awards to 
Tritons up and down the field and 
in all grade levels, including senior 
defender Jonathan Shum and 
sophomore midfielder Matthew 
Davey, both selected to the All-
CCAA First Team. Freshman mid-
fielder Brett Maurer garnered 
Freshman of the Year honors while 
sophomore forward Jon Krupansky 
and junior defender Luke Russell 
took home A11-CCAA Second 
Team honors. 

Co-captain Shum was honored 
for the third year in a row for his 
strong defensive play. He previous-
ly earned an A11-CCAA Second 
Team selection in 2002 and an A1l-
CCAA Honorable Mention in 
2001. 

"It was really exciting to be 
noticed by the coaches," Shum 
said. "It was humbling to be hon-
ored for the position [ play 
[defender), and it speaks for how 
good we are as a team." 

Shum was named c<>-captain for 
the Tritons this year, which means 
he has taken on more re ponsibili-
ties in addition to maintaining his 
high level of play. 

"It was hard at first being cap-
tain because of having more 
responsibilities, but I just relaxed 
and improved my play over the sea-
son," Shurn said 

Fellow honoree Krupansky 
thought his captain was well 
deserving of the honor and 
admired his contribution to the 
team. 

"Shurn was a great leader. He 
was an inspiration on and off the 
field ," Krupansky said. "His actions 
were amazing." 

Davey, who was voted All-CCAA 
Honorable Mention in his rookie 
season a year ago, joined Shurn in 
the All-CCAA First Team. This 
midfielder made life difficult for 
opponents all season with his offen-
sive prowess and led the Tritons in 
three offensive categories: goals 
scored (eight), assists (eight) and 
points (24). A penalty kid: specialist, 
Davey, nicknamed "Daveyesque" 
like pro soccer star David Beckham, 
converted four of 6ve penalty kick 
opporrunities this season. 

"I'm proud as I could be of 
Davey," Krupansky said. "He was 
solid in every game. Even if he was 
having a bad game, he was still just 
as good as anybody out there." 

Maurer also had high praise for 
Davey: "I can't say enough about 
him. Hes the best player on the 
team." 

Maurer surprised Armstrong 
and his teammates by stepping up 
and playing strong all season. The 
numbers he put up in his freshman 
year - four goals and five assists-
impressed coaches enough to vote 
him Freshman of the Year. 

"Brett was de erving of the 
award." Armstrong said. "He had a 
wonderful year. As a freshman, you 
don't always know how [they will 
twn out], but he was a house on 
fire." 

Maurer was a clutch player for 
the Tritons, ending two overtime 
matches against Cal State 
Stanislaus and Grand Canyon with 
game-winning goals. His three 
game-winners rank him at the top 
in that category for UCSD. 

"[ am just happy about getting 
the opportunity to play. It was cool 
to get the award . It pays off for the 
hard worlc, " Maurer said. 

Maurer said he enjoyed playing 
soccer in his first year; it was a 

chance for him to just p lay and not 
worry about anything else. 

"I just love having the ball on 
my feet," Maurer said. "It was fun 
being out there and not worrying 
about anything for two hours." 

The AJl-CCAA Second Team 
honorees, Krupansky and Russell, 
were voted for their reliable defen-
sive play and for stepping up and 
contributing offensively for the 
Tritons. Russell put points on the 
board with his four goals, all head-
ers, including a hat trick against 
rival Cal State San Bernardino to 
kick off the season at home. In 
addition, his fourth goal of the sea-
son came at the right time for his 
team, lifting UCSD out of a hole to 
upset Cal State Dominguez Hills, 
ranked No.2 at the time. 

Russell suffered a thigh injury 
on Oct. 18 that sidelined him for 
the next five games. He returned to 
action in a reserve role in the 
Tritons final game of the year, 
when they were eliminated in the 
playoffs. But, his play during the 
season was good enough for a 
CCAA recognition. 

"Luke had a funny season 
because it was an injured season," 
Armstrong said. "But he deserved 
[the All-CCAA econd Team selec-
tion], and r look forward to his play 
next season." 

Krupansky, a 2002 All-CCAA 
Honorable Mention, was second on 
the team with five goals and third in 
points with II , making him a solid 
player for UC D thi season. 

"1 was very plea ed [to get the 
honor) coming in from last year, 
where I made a small impact," 
Krupansky said. "This year, as a 
whole, I made a larger impact." 

Armstrong was also pleased with 
Krupansky being selected to the All -
CCAA Second Team and expects 
even more from his forward. 

"I will be very surprised if he 
doesn't make All-CCAA Fir t Team 
next season," Armstrong said.

Tritons ready to play ball 
Four starters return to women 's basketball 

By STEPHEN VONDERACH 
Contributing Writer 

The UC D women's basketball 
team will begin its season on Nov. 
21 against eattle Paci6c on the 
road. The Tritons are 0-1 in the 
preseason after a tough 6-76 loss 
to US D on ov. 8. The ream was 
upposcd to have two scrimmages 

before thc season started, but both 
were cancelled. Despite the lack of 
pre ea on games, UCSD head 
coach Judy Malone is optimistic 
about the start of the schedule. 

"USD was a good rune-up for 
the start of the season. They are a 
Division I school, and [ thought we 
played well again t them," Malone 
said. "We have some tough tea Ins 
to start with, and our conference is 
so tough. I was impressed by what I 
aw, cspecially with our offense. I 

don't think we scored 76 points in 
any of our games last year." 

The Tritons hope to improve 
from last eason with four starters 
and two players who suffered 
injuries last year returning to the 
2003-04 squad. 

"We had two players Gunior 
centcr Katie McGann and sopho-
more guard Kim Buffum] that 
were hurt last year early on in the 
season, but they're back this year 
and they're healthy," Malone said. 
"They are both impact players. 
McGann is a potential staner, and 
Buffum has a great outside hot. " 

Senior team captain and Fir t 
Team A11- alifornia ollegiate 
Athletic As iation guard Ali Ginn 
will lead UC D. he wa the 
Tritons' leading scorer la t year and 
Malone has high expeClations of 
her again tllis eason. 

"She's been taking 1,000 shots 
a day, and he looks really good," 
Malone said. " ller form is rcally 
good, and I expe I her to improve 
this year. he's an excellent wing 
shoorer. hc" Ollr tcam leader."

and Margaret Johnson (forward), 
and cni r ' InC.1 Bachmann and 
sophomore Andrea ller lei, who 
will split time at poilll b'UaTu. 

Malone is happy to have the 
competition at poilll guard. 

"It's • pOSItion wc've becn 
SJlar~e m for .1 whilc," she ~.Ild . 

Malonc IS lookmg r. ,rtl to 
~ 'clng how thc team will benefit 

from having a more experienced 
roster. 

"It's starting to click, starting to 
come together," she said. "We 
have eight juniors and seniors this 
year. It's really the first year we 
have been experience-laden." 

" I don't think we scored 
76 points in any of our 

games last year," 
- Judy Malone, UCSD INOmen's 

basketball head coach 

She hopes this will help them 
handle UC Davis this year. 

"They're our main rival in the 
conference. T hey're a big, strong 
team, but playing USD helped, 
and this year we have the experi-
enced players which we haven't 
had in the past," Malone said. 

The team pial'S UC Davis at 
home onJan. 16 and on the road on 
Feb. 21. 

Malone also expects a lot from 
the freshmen this year. 

"Our freshmen are very solid," 
she said. 

Surprise walk-on Hillary 
Hansen (who stands 6 feet tall), 
along with Megan Niedermeyer 
and Amy Bissinger (both 6 feet, 2 
inches tall) have brought orne size 
and toughness to the team. 

" It 's nice to have some height 
and strength," Malone said. 

Other freshmen on the roster 
include Juster, Meag:1n Eslulian and 
last year's reds hi rt Buffum. 
Rounding out the team are retwn-
ing seniors Bachmann (guard), 
Ginn and forward Robyn Phillips. 

The team has a tough start in 
its schedule, as they will continue 
o n from Seattle Pacific to play two 
more road games against Central 
Washington and Grand Canyon 
before heading home to play in 
the Alumni Game on Dec. 6. 

Malone is enthu iastic about 
the upcoming season. 

"We've got a good team this 
year and I'm looking forward to 
seeing what the team can do," 
Malone said. "I'm excited about 
starting the season."

NCAA: Cross country heads to 
Nationals for the second time 

continued from page ~o 
said. "The team is very excited and 
the coaches are ecstatic." 

In fact, it will be the second tri p 
to the Division II National 
Championships for each team si nce 
the men qualified and finished 15th 
in Slippery Rock, Penn., in 2001, 
and the women put together a 
17th-place effort in Ashland, Ohio, 
in their first-ever appearance a year 
ago. 

Competing against the nation's 
best runners on unknown terrain 
renders predictions or concrete 
goals difficult to make for the team. 

"We want to run like our regular 
meets and have both sides make the 
top 12, but I believe that they can 
move up from there," Wrcia said. 

This has lead to a little anxiety 
for the team, since it has not faced 
the vast majority of the competi tion 
expected in North Carolina. 

"The Nationals has the 23 best 
Division II teams, most of whom 
we do not know," Garcia said. "The 
guys only competed against three 
of them, and the girls only compet-
ed against two."· 

Members of both teams have 
turned in strong and consistent 
individual performances. Freshman 
Tina Firouz has made a great 
impact on the women's team, often 
pacing the Triton women. 

Firouz's efforts have paid off. 
She earned All-Region recognition 
with a sixth-place finish out of 154 
in 22 minutes and 25.5 seconds at 
the 2003 CAA Division II West 
Regional. She al 0 finished fourth 
at the CCAA Championships, 
earning All-CCAA and CCAA 
Freshman of the Year honors as 
UCSD placed second behind 
Chico State in that event as well . 

Junior Lindsay Stalker has also 
accumulated many awards for her 
performances, and sophomore 
Michelle DiMeo and seniors 
Amanda Felder, Lillian Gardiner 
and Kathy Read are other notably 
solid Triton point-scorers. 

Strong runners on the men's side 
include junior Robert Eap and 
senior Julian Nahan, both of whom 
were All-Region performers at the 
Division 11 West Regional. 
Freshman Steve Vargas is also an 
accomplished runner. 

Another vital runner is Neil 
Kalra, the senior who helped lead 
the Triton men to top-three finishes 
at CCAA Championships earlier in 
the year. This was the second 

straight year he earned All-CCAA 
honors, improving on his lOth-place 
finish from 2002 by completing the 
8000-meter course in 24:37.7 for 
fourth place at that meet. 

While individual performances 
have had a huge impact on the 
momentum of the team, unity and 
solidarity have also been key factors 
in the team's success. 

"The team works as a unit. 
Though they score separately, they 
see each other as one team," Garcia 
said. 

UCSD will likely maintain a 
strong presence with regard to both 
the performances of the athletes and 
the runners' admirers. 

"Fan support has been some-
thing important," Garcia said. "We 
expect a crowd of 50 UCSD friends 
and family in orth Caroli na ." 

To prepare for ationals, both 
teams reduced weekly mileage to 
run the meet fresh and confident. 

"We tapered down our miles 
and mixed in more workouts with 
spikes because the ground may 
become soggy in orth Carolina," 
Garcia said. 

t the CAA Division II West 
Regional, Chico State boasted the 
top-ranked men's and women's 
tearns in the region, had five tOp- 10 
finishers in each race help it finishing 
first in both events. Chico State out-
distanced UCSD, 28-79 in the 
10,OOO-meter men's race, and 38-
124 in the 6,OOO-meter women's 
race. 

The men's title was Chico 
State's second-in-a-row, while the 
women took home their first 
regional crown in history. All of 
this evidence suggests Chico State 
to be a tough opponent for UCSD. 

Other prominent men's region-
al rivals include the third-place 
finisher Cal Poly Pomona and 
fourth-place Western 
Washington. The chief local com-
petition for the women will likely 
come from Chico State and Cal 
State tanislaus - the third-place 
fini her on the women's side. 

Strong results at Nationals will 
cap brilliant careers for some vet-
eran graduating runners and will 
crown the first season for some 
promising new athletes. 

Both teams' momentum 
increased noticeably over the course 
of tile past season, which illustrates 
their strength and depth. With this 
in mind, the Tritons will aim high 
when they compete tllis weekend.

Women's soccer wins OT penalty shootout 
UCSD eliminates CSUDH, advances to NCAA quarterfinals 

Cross

By ALAN McBROOM 
Staff Writer 

Even before the Nov. 17 
CM Division II playoff match 

between UCSD and Cal State 
Dominguez Hills was played, it 
had all the makings of a pres ure-
packed, adrenaline-filled slugfest. 
Cal tate Dominguez Hills hand-
ed UCSD its first loss, 3-2, in La 
Jolla on ept. 28. UC D exacted 
revenge on Nov. 9 by soundly han-
dling the Toro in the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
Final, 5-1, in Car on, Calif. 

After playing 110 minutes of 
scorele soccer, which included 
two overtime periods, it took the 
pair of exhausted squads a round 
of penalty kicks to determine the 
final verdict. The post-overtime 
penalty shootout was won by 

C D, 4-3, and was filled with 
subplots of its own. 

For the hootout, UC D head 
coach Brian McManus sat senior 
goalkeeper Kami Poma after she 
had played every minute of regula-
tion and the overtimes, in favor of 
sophomore goalie Alyson Berger. 
After falling behind with the first 
miss of the shootout, UCSD 
caught a break when the referee 
determined freshman Megan 
Dickey's failed attempt came 
before he blew his whistle. He 
awarded Dickey another shot, and 
she took advantage of the oppor-
tunity, barely sneaking her kick 
under the crossbar. 

"I th.ink [the referee 1 should 
have called something before she 
kicked the ball and not let the 
whole play proceed," Cal State 
Dominguez Hills head coach Joe 
Flanagan said. "We went from a 
kick away from winning, to tied, 
and then eventually losing." 

UCSD senior Amy Goker start-
ed the penalty kicks off with a rock-
et into the lower left comer that was 
just out of the reach ofToro keeper 
Alba Garcia. Erin Fiegler and Tanya 
Wilson convened their attempts for 
Cal State Dominguez Hills, with a 
successful try from Triton freshman 
Kelly Cochran in between. Senior 
Molly Carlson caromed one off the 
post and away for the fir t miss of 
the shootout, and Toro heila Cook 
buried her shot to put UCSD in a 
3-2 hole. 

The apparent miss by Dickey 
seemed to dash the Triton hopes, 
bur instead, her second-chance 
strike tied the shootout at three 
apiece. Chantel Eastwood then 
missed wide left, with a diving 
Berger covering the correct post in 
case the ball was on frame. Senior 
Megan Mendoza pounded her kick 
into the lower right of the net, giv-
ing UCSD four goals out of five 
attempr< 

The Toros needed Laci Gruner 
to convert in order to stay alive, 
but Berger came up huge with a 
diving save to her right. The ball 
was hit with pace, but Berger had 
guessed the direction to dive cor-
rectly, and she smothered the ball

The entire team rushed Berger 
after her game-winning save. 

"Karni is the big-game keeper, 
but she's not as comfortable with 
penalty kicks," McManus said. He 
based his decision to play Berger 
on her performances in practice 

against penalty kicks. 
After 10 ing in the NCAA play-

offs last year to UC Davis in a

prepared for another likely situa-
tion.

The reigning Western Water 
Polo Association champion Triton 
men's water polo squad will face off 
against its first opponent, No. 8 
seed Pomona-Pitzer, on Nov. 21 at 
the University of Redland . UCSD 
enters the WWPA tOurnament 
seeded first and undefeated in the 
division. In their only conte t this 
season, the Tritons blew the 
Sagehens out of the water in a 25-2 
rout. 

The tournament is not a certain 
victory for UC D, however. 

"Right now, anybody could be 
in the pool for the final game. 

Every team [at the WWPA tourna-
ment] has a chance," junior driver 
Clark Petersen said. 

Last year, UCSD and Loyola 
Marymount met in the final 
match of the tournament, which 
the Tritons went on to win, earn-
ing them a NCM tournament 
berth. 

While the Lion are eeded 
second going into the tournament 
again, they are not necessarily the 
most threatening opponent. The 
Tritons defeated the Lions in both 
of their meetings this year.

there," senior co-captain utility
