Food Co-op to Offer 
Low Cost Products 

By Jolla Hoadroe 
~NewlEdI"" 

An AS SPODIOred food co-op 
will open in the Student Center 
within a few weeks, according 
to Michael DeBell, a Muir 
College senior. 

The co-op, to be located in the 
.Eut Conference Room, will 
offer UCSD students a com-

'p'ete variety of fresh, or-
ganically grown (no pesticides, 
herbicides or chemical ferti-
lizers used) produce, sand-
wiches, dairy products, breads 
and dry goods at "prices lower 
than the supermarkets," 
DeBell said. 

DeBell , who is business 
manager of the co-op, said the 
purpose of the food co-op is to 

1 offer students a healthy alter-native to cafeteria food. "The university community is too far J removed from basic natural 
foods; it's impossible to find

A campus telephone dfrec-

tory, which will include the 
name, addreu and telephone 
number of all resident and 
commuter students, will be 
distributed at UCSD sometime 
in November. 

According to the Telecom-
municatioas Office, 5000 copies 
of the directory, now being 
printed up, will be dJatributed 
flft to allltudents. Iuues will 
be obtainable from various

In addition to student direc-
tory information, pertinent 
information including the 
phone numbers of student 
organizations and a cafn5

All personalinfonnation n the

student registration tape in the 
Registrar', Office. According 
to a Telecom Office representa-

services on campua are closed; 
to help a student get in toucb 
with his/her feelings or prob-
lems and then to make a 
referral to the helping service 
on campus or in the community 
that would best meet the needs 
of the caller," according to the 
FOCUS Core Skills Manual 
which is given to FOCUS 
volunteers. 

Pat Rattigan, another 
FOCUS volunteer, explained 
that FOCUS is not intended 81 a 
crisis intervention center. 
" We've had calls after a really 
good experiel!ce," he said. 

Rattigan said that many 
campus services like EDNA 
receive calls which should be 
directed to FOCUS. In tum, 
FOCUS can refer students to 
various services ranging from 
birth control to suicide preven-
tion. 

FOCUS volunteers undergo 
several montha of training, 
coordinated by Miriam Levina 
of CounaeliDl • Plycbological 
Services. They are iD.Itnlcted 
to follow several ethical

taking advantage of caller in

"It's a one-time type of

lisle, a FOCUS volunteer.

campua is meat products - if 
you're a vegetarian, you're left 
out," commented DeBell. 
CoDlequently, the co-op will 
sell oDly foods Which are 
"procured by DOn-cieltructive 
means," DeBell added. 

DeBell said he helped or-
ganize and run the original food 
co-op two years ago, which 
failed in its first year of 
operation because of financial 
problems due to pilferage and 
spoilage of products. "I want to 
see it (the food co-op) happen 
again because food is impor-
tant to me and there is no way to 
get good, healthy, nutritious 
food on campus except for 
Future Foods, which is too 
expensive," DeBell said. 

The core of the food co-op will 
consist of five people, all UCSD 
students, each assigned 'a 
responsibility such as sales, 
financing, food preparation, 
clean-up and public relations. 
According to DeBell, all labor 
in the co-op will be on a 

volunteer basis. " A person will 
qualify by working four hours 
per week in the co-op - this 
entitles the worker to buy all 
groceries at wholesale prices, 
to attend meetings and to vote 
on all policy questions in equal 
status with the core," he said. 
The co-op will rotate the 
working positions periodically 
in order to "teach anyone 

willing the entire process of 
running a co-op," DeBell 
added. 

A food co-op organizational 
meeting will be held on Oct. 5 at 
7 pm in the East Conference 
Room. Anyone who would like 
to know more about the co-op in 
any respect and is interested in 
volunteering is urged to attend, 
DeBell said. 

Rock Strikes 
Student at Revelle 

By Seew Morus 
Stefanie ~amsdale, a UCSD 

graduate student, has lodged a 
complaint with the UCSD 
Police Department in response 
to being hit by an object 
launched from a Revelle dorm 
last week. 

The police are investigating 
Galathea Hall's 250-350 suites, 
in the belief that a rock was shot 
from a sling-shot or a similar 
weapoD at Ramadale 88 sbe 
walked along the west balcony 
of Cluster Ubrary. 

Related leUer on page 3 

A police search of the library 
balcony produced three If.-inch 
stones, one of wliich is thought 
to have hit, Ramsdale's right 
shoulder. The blow .hit hard 
enough to cause immediate 
swelling and three hours of 
painful tingling in Ramsdale's 
right fingers, leaving a deep 
muscle bruise for many days 
afterward. 

"I first thought," said 
Ramsdale, "that 1 had been 
shot.. .I turned and saw an 
object fall from my shoulder 
and clatter on the walk." After 
a shocked 20 seconds of trying 
to understand what had hap-
pened, Ramsdale said she 

figured " the stone had to have 
come from Galathea .. .1 saw 
faces there and leaned over the 
railing and yelled: 'whoever 
did that, you bad better stop! ' " 

According to Campus Police 
Officer Rick Sanchez, the 
existence of the sling-shot " is 
just a guess" based on the 

apparen~ velocity, trajectory, 
and smallness of whatever hit 
Ramsdale. Unless the inves-
tigation can determiDe the 
actual weapon a felony charge 
of assault ·with a deadly weapon 
cannot be filed and the case will 
remain a misdemeanor, he 
said. 

In particular, this incident 
highlights what the Philosophy 
Department, for wbom Rams-
dale is preparing her candidacy 
exam, has bitterly complained 
about: barrages of Junk and 
verbal abuse usually hurled 
from the Revelle donns at 
female students and employees 
according to Henry Allison, 
Chairman of the Philosophy 
Department. 

Judith Edwin, Revelle resi-
dent dean , reports that al-
though the potential for serious 
injury is great in this kind of 
incident, this is the first time in 
her two years as dean that

VATICAN CITY (AP) - Will 
the DeX~ time be the right time 
for Cardinal Giuseppe Siri, the 
eternal second-runner in papal 
electiou? 

Tbe powerful 72-year-old 
arcbbl.bop of Genoa , wbo 
correctly predicted a very 
short conclave after the death 
of Pope Paul VI, says the next, 
one, startiDI Oct. 14, will last 
two or three day •. 

Siri should know. He will be 
tbe only cardinal to bave 
attended four conclaves. 

" This is a Iood thina, 10 we 
can bave more time to reflect, " 
Siri said in an interview with 
the Genoa new.paper II La-
von." 

According to most in.ide 
accounts, the shifting of Siri's 
votes to the then-Cardinal 
Giovanni Montini gave the 
required two-thirds vote to 
elect Pope Paul VI. Even 
before then, he was considered 
to be a favorite of Pope Pius 
XII, but considered too young 
at 52. 

The latest account of the 
conclave tbat elected Pope 
John Paul I on Aug. 26 indicates 
Sirt garnered 25 votes, com-
pared with 23 for the future 
pope, Cardinal Albino Luciani, 
on the first ballot. 

According to the news maga-
zine Veja of Bruil, the world's 
largest Catholic country, Siri 
and Luciani were followed by 
Cardinals Sergio Pignedoli, 
witb 11 votes, Sebastiano 
Bagglo, 9 votes, Austria's 
Franz Koenig, • Paolo Bertoli, 
5, and Eduardo Plronlo of 
Argentina, 4. The remaining 
votes reportedly were scat-
tered among various card\nals. 

After the first ballot, accord-
ing to the magazine, Siri's 
conservative supporters de-
cided to shift over to Luciani, 
who got 56 votes - 19 fewer 
than required. On the third 
ballot, Luciani is reported to 
have received 90 votes. 

Siri Is frequently depicted as 
an arch-co nservative who 
consistently blocked reforms 
during the Vatican II Council 
from 1962 to 1965. But Siri 
rejects both the conservative 
and the progressive labels.

The lUerrillas planned to 
shower the town with rocket .

explosives-filled boat on the 
shore, the report said. 

An army spoieaman said the

Born in Genoa, Sirl was 
ordained a priest 50 years ago. 
After his appointment in 1930 as 
profe880r of dogmatic theology 
in a Genoa seminary, he 
became an expert in church law 
and a renowned theoloeian. 

In 1944, Pope Pius XII named 
him auxiliary bisbop of Genoa. 
He took over as one of Italy's 
youngest archbishops when 
World War II ended. 

Siri engineered tbe 1944 
surrender of tbe Nazis in 
Gneoa, and tried to make the 
port city into a key center for 
Italy's postwar economic 
recovery. Today be maintains 
cool, but working, relations 
with the Socialist-Communlat 
alliance that governs his bome 
town. 

It said the crew of the Israeli 
navy boat captured seven guer-
rIUas, three of them wounded. 
There was DO report of any 
Israeli casualties. 

According to the military 
account: 

The boat was spotted south of 
Dabab beacb, 10 miles south of 
Ellat and 50 miles north of 
Sharm el-8heikh, the southern 
tip of the Sinai Peninsula. 

Rapists Receive 
Stiffer Penal,tles 

A cardinal for the past 25 
years, Siri's personality is 
generally described as stiff, 
though be is easily accessible. 

Many of his supporters say, 
thoueh, that he is more "him-
self" with people be knows. 

" It is not rare for him to wash 
the dishes after a dinner with 
friends," one of bis aides said. 
" But outside this circle, he is 
different." 

The IsraeD patrol boat tried 
to intercept it and its crew 
began maneuvering in an effort 
to escape. Warning shots were 
fired but the boat.ped on and 
"the navy boat was forced to 
fire at the boat In order to 
damage it. Cannonade fire 
from the navy boat hit ODe of the 
explosive charcea on the boat 
and it began to sink." 

Before the abip sauk, Israeli 
sailors boarded it and counted 
42 lZ2mm rockets and a "buge 
quantity of explosive materi-
al." Six of tho8e aboard the boat 
were captured in the water aod 
one was grabbed on the deck of 
the boat.

fomia, women are more threat-
ened by rape, according to FBI 
statistics. ' 

Sen. Geol'le DeubneJian of 
Long Beacb, the Republican 
candidate for attorney general, 
introduced the bill, SB 1471, 
which bad the backing from 
many women'.lJ'OUps. 

Deukmejian's bill, and a 
recently siped law increasing 
pri.on .entences, require 
anyone convicted of rape to be 
sentenced to three, .ix or eight 
years in prison, depending on 
the severity. One-third of the 
time could be deducted for good 
behavior, but additional yean 
could be added for prior 
convictions or use of, a gun. 

Brown said FBI statlstlcs for 
1m sbow that there were 41.8 
rapes per 100,. population in 
California, compared to 23.6 
per 100,000 in the mid-Atlantic 
states. He did not offer an 
explanation for the difference. 

But Sen. Ala.n Robbins (D-
Van Nuys) authoroftbreeo~er 
bills on rape signed by Brown, 
said the overhaul of Cali-
fornia's rape laws that started 
several years ago has encour-
aged ' more rape victims to 
report their attacks. 

Robbins' bills provide 
SlOO,OOO from the state to keep 
some local rape counseling 
centers open, order a study of 
psychiatric treatment of im-
prisoned rapists, and let the 
prosecuting witness In a rape 
case have a person of her cboice

Opinion 

Violent Assault ~Deplored 
Editor: 

It baa come to my attention 
that lOme of the students wbo 
may have been involved in or 
who have heard about tbe 
presumed slingsbot incident 
last Tuesday mOrning don't 
understand wbat all the fuss is 
about. I am the student wbo was 
injured in that incident; my 
perspective on the event is 
unJque, and If the issue needs to 
be clarified perbaps an account 
of Its personal impact, alon, 
with my reflections on tbe 
problem of random, anony-
moUi acts of violence on this 
campus, will help. 

Many years ago in another 
city I was assaulted and beaten 
up by a man who had been 
waitinJ for me in a darkened 
room; my first awareness of 
my assailant's presence was of 
a fist smasbine out of tbe 
darkneu into my neck. Early 
on a brigbt Tuesday mornin, a. 
I walked along the weat third-
floor balcony of the H-L 
building I was struck on the 
sboulder with great force by a 
fast-moving rock. I cried out in 
pain, spied the rock which had 
clattered to the balcony floor, 
and leaned over the rail to shout 
at the faces barely visible in the 
shadowed alcoves directly 
across tbe way in Galathea 
Hall. The resemblance be·' 
tween these two violent acts is 
not far-fetched but sbould be 
readily apparent. In fact the 
tissue damage inflicted by the 
rock Tuesday morning was 

greater than that inflicted by 
the initial blow many years 
ago, wbich was off target; the 
psychological impact of tues-
day's blow, however, was 
precisely similar to the impact 
of that unprovoked and unsus-
pected fist in the dark. The 
salient difference between the 
two acta is not that the first 
assailant subsequently found 
his aim and left me with many 
bruises, whereas the second 
retired to his alcove and left me 
with only one, but is rather that 
I was known to the first 
assailant and his auault was a 
per.onal attack, whereas I 
suspect thi. was not the case 
Tuesday. It is this latter 
circumstance whicb makes 
Tuesday's incident an appro-
priate cause for public concern 
at UCSD. 

Since Tuesday I bave learned 
that this ldnd of incident is not 
rare on campus: I've heard 
stories about a woman nar-
rowly missed by a makeshift 
spear cast from a window of 
Argo Hall; about glass bottles 
flung from one balcony to 

. another or dropped from 
dormitory ledies in savage 
disregard for the safety of 
passers-by; about an ash-can 
hurled through an open office 
doorway; and so on. Again and 
again I've heard, par:ticularly 
from female staff and graduate 
students in my own depart-
ment, who daily must walk 
along the balcony facing 
Galathea Hall and risk bom-

banlment with pieces of fruit safety which I've experienced 
and other objects as well as sharply while on campus since 
harassment by obscene cat- Tuesday, is pervasive. I have 
calls and lewd invitations, that . heard, on the other hand, that 
the keen sense of physical there is ' a tendency in some 
vulnerability, the general quarters to regard particular 
uneasiness about personal incidents like the slingshot 

incident as juvenJle pranks, on 
a par, perhaps, with defacing 
classrooms or vandalizing 
automobiles or flipping a 
spitwad at the girl in the first

Get Career Planning Help 
Editor: 

We like to raise an issue that 
affects over 3,500 students at 
UCSD, namely, tbe value of an 
education in the humanities or 
social sciences once students 
eraduate. We don't arlUe with 
the eeneral usefulness of these 
studies of their excellence for 
graduate scbool admissions. It 
is recognized, though, not only 
in college placement studies 
but more importantly by many 
UCSD alumni seeking employ-
ment, that career prospects for 
these majors are often dismal. 

Getting good data and taking 
advantage of off-campus op-
portunities well before gradu-
ation are excellent ways of 
creating brighter career pros-
pects. Students and staff can 
work together to expand career 
options. The H&SS Job Devel-
opment Council is such a 
cooperative effort. It will hold a 
campus-wide planning meeting 
on Thursday, October 5, 1978. 
from 4-5 pm at the Student 

Center Building B., Conference 
Room. In the planning stages 
are peer counseling, off-
campus jobs and internship 
development, special booklets, 
site visits and a newsletter. 
These are opportunities for 
students to gain new experi-
ences and they are means' for 
benefitting others at this 
university . H&SS majors , 
especially at the freshman, 
sophomore and junior levels 

are invited to bring tbeir ideas 
and energy to the meeting.

So OpeM the new composition 
by Paul William Simons. He is 
busy at work writing, per-
fol1llina recordilll and mixing 
down his new pieces for a 
record release sometime in the 
next few months. Tbis eclectic 
collection includes CalU&rOPbe 
(the openilll lines of which 
appear In the paragraph 
above), TIle Ballad of Cbrl.daD 
C. C~aa,Jaek 'n'J~­
ma or TIle CoDustve CoUlaioa iD 
die CoIUeun Club of Two 
Cu1&urn. 

His main interest is in 
American music-drama. He Is 
a composer-musician·actor-
performer sometimes referred 
to as a shaman because his 
forma of "ritual" and the props 
he uses conjure images of a 
medicine man makilll spells 
through vocal incantations. His 
link with the theatre , he 
explains, compels him to be a 
performer, though the true 
nature of bia work is com-
posing. 

"My poetry wouldn' t make it 
in a book. It ia very flat. But in 
front of an audience it comes 
alive .. .It's really good theatre 
music .. . a form of opera, which 
I am interested in." 

Over the summer he has been 
working with The Community 
Arts Program in San Diego, 
performing there as a folk-
singer·guitarist three nights 
weekly. In his off-hours he bas 
been writing, listening to Harry 
Partch's iMtrumentations in 
one ear and studying Wag-
nerian operas with the other. 
This dialectic and self-defined 
structure of study would 
definitely produce a hybrid of 
unusual plumage. He is a bard, 
a keeper and writer of folklore 
and legend, an electric ener-
getic blend of classical discl-
pUne with a eos in·between-
underground-films-street-
singer's savvy, the composer of 
legend/epic operas which he 
performa. With regard to the 
'ritual' aspect of his work, he 
defines it as " baving set kind of 
movements and situations 
which are repeated over and 
over in context. TbIs is basic in 
my work with music and 
theatre." But "ritual" as such 
(a phrase bandied about by 
many contemporary artists) 
does not define his per· 
formance. 

Paul's most intenSt) oncern 
is with the emotional fonduc-
tion of the voice, the bittersweet 
plaintiveness wth v.hich the 
audience can experience com· 
passion for the situation uf 
humanity. He cites Bob Dylan's 
work of the earl: 60s as 
indicative of this quality of 
pathos - a raw force which 
speaks. 

" My works on th~ printed 
page wouldn't get me anywhere 
.. . they're vivid in the live 
context. I've had the comment 
from several people wbo 
consider themselves good poets 
that my poetry is nat or Just too 
mucb - is askin, too much. 
They're offended that they've 
spent so much time at bein, 

wordamitha ... but my feelilll is 
that in the 20th century poetry 
bas drastically cballled and 
that by the end of this century it 
will have ebaqed greatiy ... 
that it will demand a future 
'weclcliJ1l' of poetry and drama-
tic mufe very sfrnllar to the 
minstrel tradition. This tradi· 
tion thrived until the advent of 
the printing preas which 
challled the whole aspect of 
wbat the poet was. It's a whole 
different bag for the poet to be 
one who spends all of his/her 
time creating adjectives to 
describe something by pen or 
by typewriter. Before, a poet 
would spend all of that time 
grooming the technique; to be 
able to convey through the 
emotional conduction of the 
voice or the situation of live 
presentation the feeling or the 
adjectives. The poet could 
describe things, I'm sure, 
either by tbe way he used the 
voice or by gesture and by the 
almost psychic transmiuion 
which ancient storytellers 
relied upon greatIy. That oral 
kind of psychic transmiuion 
was traMlated with the advent 
of the printing press. Before, a 
poet or a presenter of poetry 
and drama had to be, first, a 
skilled actor and a fairly skilled 
musician with a sense of 
timing and a sense of being able 
to convey emotIon by a gesture 
and an impulse or a feelinl 
which people in a room can 
definitely sense and feel. But 
those things relegated to the 
psychic have no avail on the 
printed pale. They have to be 

dealt with in terma of adjec-
tives or lon, descriptive 
phrases. 

Born and raiaed in a small 
farm area in weaternNewYork 
State near the Seneca Indian 
Reservation, Paul bas been 
interested in and playilll muic 
since he was three. He moved to 
Florida with his family where 
he had a folk group in high 
school and hUIll out in coffee 
bouses refining his style. His 
ea rly interest in medicine 
lradually faded when he went 
to college to become a doctor. 
He then transferred to The 
Julliaro School of Music in New 
York where he majored in the 
double bass for concert per-
formance, studied songwriting 
and composition, took his 
summers off to Colorado, later 
graduated from Julliard and 
then went to San Francisco and 
became a street poet. 

Performing in-between 
movies on Thursday, Friday 
and Saturday nights outside 
bookstores, on stage, on the 
street before concerts, "pas-
sing the hat" and dependilll 
upon this for his living, Paul 
began to define what he now 
terms hiB "corporeal per-
formance style." (Corporeal in 
this sense means usilll the 
language of the body to express 
itself and briDi words to life off 
the printed pale.) 

Paul ia currently employed 
through CETA (a liveable 
financial 8ssist for many 
California artists) and the 
Community Arts Program at 
3rd and F Streets in San Diego.

Skynyrcl's Fir., ADd ••• Last· 
Lynyrd Skynyrd (MCA) 

For aD album of out-take 
material, Skynyrd'. First 
ADd ••• Last has none of the 
slovenly jamminess associated 
with the term. Indeed, Sky· 
nyrd's chops areupon this disc, 
from Ronnie Van Zandt's full· 
bodied vocals to the ringing 
IUitar work of Ed King and 
Gary ROIIington. Before the 
unfortunate plane crash, 
LynYrd Skynyrd were more 
than likely the best rock and 

- roU band in the nation. The 
raucous freshness of First 
ADd ••• LaI& only acceDtuates the 
aeD8e of 1088. This band didn't 
deaerve to die before the)' got 
old. A miD ••

TRAVEUNG? 

Revie",s 
Rock and roll is great music 

because anyone can remember 
the basic riffs in their head 
without three years worth of 
music lessons . That doe. not 
mean that anyone can sing it, 
however, as Dyan Diamond 
proves. She blares, bleats, 
screeches and mewls in a 
vocabularY of cover-up man· 
nerisms, but she isn't the 
female Mick Jagger, or even 
the caucasian Yoko Ono. The 
rock and roll here is stiff, 
messy, full of a lot of thrashing 
in dead air. Even " Mystery 
Dance" by Elvis Costello 
sounds washed out. A must to 
avoid. D. 

800111 
Meanwhile ... Back In The 
S&a&es-Willie Alexander ana 
the Boom Boom Band (MCA) 

Willie Alexander has a 
gruff, slurring voice that 
sounds like a cross between Lou 
Reed and MlckJagger, which is 
to say that he hasn't much of a 
voice to speak of. But like those 
two, he's made capitol on his 

limitations and has made an art 
out of a well·played system of 
grunts, groans, Shirl, moans 
and other vocal shortcuts that 
convey more about rock and 
roll is all about (hypotheti· 
cally) than clean-cut belters 
like Lou Gramm (Foreigner) 
and Brad Delp (Boston) . 
Couple this with the Boom 
Boom Band, a superb basic 
rock and roll unit that knows 
the intelligent differences 
between ingratiating slop-
piness and lazy ineptitude, you 
have an inviting brand of 
steamy, urban rock and roll. 
Fortunately for these guys, 
they have not as yet been 
caught up in the usual city rock 
conceits, preferring instead to 
tell their stories up front, 
straight out, with just a tinge of 
romanticism. Their individual-
ity will no doubt keep them 
from the airwaves, but there is 
an audience out there willing to 
listen to a band unspoiled by 
hype. Alexander and crew are 
sincere, as evidenced in every 
gloriously funky note they play. 

A minus.

Waterpolo/ 
A Preview 

By Jon Goetz 
With a team comprised 

almost solely of underclass-
men, it would appear to water 
polo ~oach Russ Hafferkamp 
that he has little to be excited 
about this season. Not true, 

Several of the reasons his 
team had its best season ever in 
1977 are returning this year to 
the Tritons. Facing a formid-
able slate of schools (Uni-
versity of Arizona, San Jose 
State, UC Davis, and San Diego 
State are among their op-
ponents), UCSD needs poised 
players to outmaneuver the 
tougher teams. 

Sophomore Dan Eby, the 
UCSD high scorer with 40 goals, 
will be settin, the critical two-
meter position. Tom Jorgen-
sen, a senior with experience 
that the rest of the team lacks, 
brings his consistent style of 
play to the Tritons. He played in 
88 of the team's 93 quarters last 
year, scoring 28 goals. 

Dan Crane, who Hafferkamp 
calls "a solid defender," and 
Kai Loedel, " who has potential 
to excel," both return to their 
second year of UCSD play, 
Toby Raymond and Jeff Elliott, 
two of the three freshmen 
starters in last Saturday's 
game, both show potential to be 
future top players. 

Goalie Willi Morris of 
Berkeley, also a freshman , still 
needs work on his reaction 
time, but he will get lots of 
playing time this year as the 
tea m's lone goalkeeper.

All-Cal Proves 
Good Experience 
For V-bailers 

By Karen Hua&er 
Sporu EIII_ 

By looking at the faces of the 
UCSD women's voUeyball team 
the casual observer would 
never have been able to tell that 
the team did not win a single 
game in Saturday' s All-Cal 
Volleyball tournament . In-
stead, positive attitudes and a 
satisfied coach were in evi-
dence even though the Tritons 
ended up in the cellar when the 
final standings were anounced. 

Tournament favorite , UC 
Santa Barbara, came in and did just as expected, compiling a 
day's record of 9 wins and one 
1088, running away with the 
tournament. UC Irvine and 
UCLA's B squad both tallied 
identical 7-3 records, but UCI 
was awarded second place by 
one-tenth of a point. Calcula-
tions were made that showed 
UCI scored 132 points against 
their opponents, while UCLA 
only scored 127. Also, UCI was 
victQrious against the eventual 
winners, UCSB. 
UCSD met UCI in a losing 
effort, 15-7, 15-3 and fell to 
UCSB 15-6, 15-2. 
Nonetheless, the new Triton 
coach, Grace Greenberg, a 
former assistant volleyball 
coach at Mesa College, was 
pleased with her team. "This 
All-Cal is a great experience for 
us," Greenberg remarked. " It 
gi ves_ us a chance to try 
different substitutions and line 
up arrangements against some 
strong teams. We've got noth-
ing to lose and a lot to gain." 

Team members echoed the 
same feelings . Co-captain 
Cheryl Wright felt that the 
Tritons were "playing well as a 
team." "With all the freshmen, 
though, it will take a while to 
get used to each otber" she 
added. The team only hai three 
returnees from last year's 11-7 
squad. 

Dawn Wilson, co-captain, 
remarked on the versatility of 
this year's squad. "We are able 
to adjust and make quick 
changes. Our players are 

Young Team 
Gets Ready . 
(CoaL from pale I) 

Last Saturday's victury over 
Redlands lacked the skillful 
playing that the top players are 
capable of. The team, bow-
ever, went into the game after 
only five days of practice, 
possibly gettlna the latest start 
of all Call1omia schools. 

And this lack of workout left 
t!le team unprepared for their 
first game. "Water polo is 70% 
mental execution," explains 
Hafferkamp, "and we just 
haven't started thinking yet. 
Also, we're playing as indio 
viduals - not as a team," 

Althougb the coach won't 
offer a prediction about the 
upcoming sealOn, he feels his 
pl.ayers have the capability to 
WID the big_games. "It would be 
a tremendous challenge to beat 
the best teams. But if we play 
our game, I think we can do it. " 

" I really admire these guys 
Cor bolding down an academic 
load While competing, The guys

ship," Haffertamp adds with 
pride. "They want to play and 
they want to exceL" 

versatile - anyone can play 
any position." 

In their other games the 
Tritons dropped their closest 
contesU of the day to UC 
Riverside, 15-3, 15-12 and to UC 
Davis, 15-3, 15-6. UCLA came 
out on top against UCSD, 15-2, 
15-4, 

Greenberg admits that her 
team needs some work but she 
thinks that this " will be a good 
season for us."

Frank, Howard and Dandy Don. Pick yourself a spot, grab a seat,

Day Care Program Lauded 
own, if you have one, it takes 
time, effort and love, 

Il it with this love that I take 
Rashelle to the UCSD Day Care 
Center. There the environment 
is one of care, love and learning 
so that she won't become a 
• 'malcontented pre-Juvenile 
delinquent, convicted of mass 
homicide. " 

Without the help of daddy, 
with the added responsibility of 

a child, I want to go to school. I 
deserve that opportunity just as 
you do. 

Find out the truth about cost 
_per child at the Day Care 
Center before you 10 spreading 
horrendous misconceptions . 
Did you think your tuition pays 
the entire cost of your edu-
cation? It couldn't even begin to 
supply the Humanities library 
with toilet paper.

Since she...is responsible for 
her residents' health and

of such behavior to studenta

and unidentified by their peers.
