Cancer . Center Given $13.3 Million 
MONEY: Study in the works to 
find correlation between diet 
and breast cancer recurrence 
By Annam Manthlram 
Staff Writer 

The National Cancer Instilute has awarded a 
$13.3 mi Ilion grant to the UCSD Cancer Center 
to study how proper nutrilion might prevent 
recurrences of breast cancer in women in 
remission , officials announced Tuesday. 

The Women 's Healthy Ealing and Living 
(WHEL) study will last for eighl years, and will 
he carried out al seven ites in Califomia, 

regon, Arizona and Texas. 
"Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer 

in women," said Vicky Jones, principal investi-
gator for the UCSD part of the tudy. "Each year, 
more than 180,000 women are diagnosed with 
breast cancer and 44,000 die from a recurrence. 

"Having a recurrence is a very real threat 
facing all hreast cancer survivors, and helping 
to prevent such a recurrence is one of our most 
important research priorities," Jones added. 

WHEL researchers will study 3,000 women 
who were previous ly diagnosed wi th cancer 
and who are currently free of di seasc. They will 
be placed by random se lection into two groups 
- one group will eat the recommended healthy 
diet; the other group will cat a very high-veg-
etable diet and participate in an intensive diet-
modification process. 

"People in cultures where they eat a lot of 
vegetables don't get breast cancer anywhere ncar 
the rale that people in the United Slales do," . aid 
John Pierce, director of the Cancer Prevention 
and Control Program of the U SD anc'er 
Cenler and leader of the WHEL study. "They 
don't gel a recurren<.:e of breast cancer as well."

Court Allows 
Suit Against 
Regents 
LAW: UCSB Daily Nexus 
editor alleged violation of 
state open-meeting laws 
By Ryan Olson 
Co-News Editor 

Thc California Court of Appea l issued a 
decision on Tuesday allowing a suit hy the 
American ivil Liherties nion (ACLU) of 
Southern California allegi ng that the UC Board 
or Rl!gc nts and Gov. Petl! Wilson vio lated state 
('pen-meeting law), prior to their vote banning 
the u~e of aflirmative-acti on policies in admis-

~ ioll !> and employment to go forward . 
The ACL fil ed the case in Feb. 1996 on the 

behalf of UC Santa Barhara's student newspa-
per, The Daily Nexl/s, and Nexl/s Campus 
Edi tor Tim Molloy . 

The ACLU alIeges that Wilson, a regent hy 
virtue of his office, violated the Bagley-Keene 
Open Meeting Act by calling members of the 
Board of Regents and locking up votes before 
the July 1995 meeting at which the regents 
passed SP- I and SP-2. 

The open-meeting laws require that most 
state agencies - including the Board of 
Regents - deliberate and vote in public, 
except when di scussing financial , legal or per-
sonnel matters. 

The regents and the govcrnor tried to have 
the case thrown out of court because it was sub-
mitted after a 30-day window for verifying nul-
lilications closed. 

In Tuesday's decision, the court recognized 
the validity of the statute but allowed the law-
louit to go ahead. There i enough information to 
support the plaintiffs' claim that the govemor 
and the regent broke the law, the court ruled. 

The case will now return to trial court, 
where the case will he hcard before a jury. 

A L attomey Dan Tokaji called the ruling 
a victor . 

"We are quite pleased with the decision," 
Tokaji said. 'The decision allows the U 5B

All-Campus Graduation Planned 
Chancellor Robert Dynes has decided to institute a 

unified campus commencement for 1998 and 1999. 
Dynes said that his decision was based on the referen· 
dum passed by the A.S. counci l supporting an all-calll-
pus commencement, the Task Force on 
Commencement's report and consultation with mem-
bers of the campus community. In keeping with UCSD's 
tradition though, individual college graduations will still 
take place during this two-year trial period. 

After the 1999 graduation, the issue of an all-calll-
pus commencement will be reconsidered and a perma-
nent campus policy on graduation ceremonies will be 
determined. 

Dynes decided to repeat the all-campus commence-
ment due to the A.S. referendum, the event's ability to 
reflect UCSD's stature, the sense of community and 
ceremony it engenders, and the visibility it fosters for 
the campus. 

UCSD Chancellor's Associates 
Honor Faculty Members 

The Chancellor's ASSOCiates honored three faculty 
members for their excellence in research, teaching and 
community service at a recent meeting in the Faculty 
Club. 

The honorees include Cecil Lytle, professor of music 
and provost of Thurgood Marshall College, for 
Outstanding Community Service; Marilyn G. Farquhar, 
professor of pathology, for Excellence in Research; and 
Mark Machina, professor of economics, for Excellence 

in Teaching. 
Lytle was honored for sharing his extraordinary musi-

cal talents with the San Diego community through lec-
tures and performances at elementary schools, com-
munity centers and parks, youth music groups, televi-
sion and radio. His proposal to establish the UCSD 
charter school prompted widespread discussions on 
the university's outreach programs. 

Farquhar, the world 's foremost authority on the 
transport of substances across cell membranes, was 
honored for laying the foundation for modern under-
standing of membrane disorders in humans. 

Machina was cited for his enormous passion for 
teaching. careful presentations and dramatically enter-
taining style in drawing students to the field of eco· 
nomics. 

Petition Places the Academic 
Success Program on Ballot 

Despite the A.S. council's refusal to place the 
AcademiC Success Program on the 1998-99 A.S. elec-
tion ballot, over 2,300 students signed a petition to 
place the initiative despite the council 's decision .. 
According to the A.S. constitution, petition seekers 
need the signatures of 15 percent of the undergraduate 
population to get on the balance. 

The program would impose a $1 fee per student per 
quarter in order to provide new services such as a 
book-lending program, a peer mentors hip program, a 
peer tutoring program and an exam archive.

Graduation Ceremonies 
Should Remain Individual 

Pic ture thi s: afte r four (o r li vc, or s ix, or seven) 
yea r~ of blood, sweat and tears, students gather with 
their fri ends and famili es for one final celebrati on. 
II 's a warm, sunny day in the middle of June, and 
every last UCSD student , facully. staff and admini s-
trator has come out o f lhe woodwork to recog ni ze 
and honor the graduating seni ors. 

For the last few years , campus It:aders have bee n 
making a bi g stink out of UCSD's lack of co mmuni -
ty spirit. They would like nothing more than for us all 
to be one bi g, happy family - and we at the 
Guardia/l wholeheartedly ag ree. 

It would be nice if th fanta~y could be a rea lit y, if 
we cou ld all come together as a campus to recogni ze 
the accomplishmenls of each graduating clas~ - but 
lhe cold, harsh trulh is that th rowing people together 
on their last day of school and expecting a co mmunity 
to form spontaneously is a hit like throwing Serbs and 
Croats togethe r in a small country and ex pec ting them 
to make peace. In other words , it isn' t going to happen . 

We need to start building a community from the 
gr LInd up, if we ever want that fant asy g raduati on to 
become a reality - something we expec t will 
hecome painfully obvious over the next tw years a~ 
we participate in Chancellor Robert Dynes' g rand 
l!xpcriment with a uni lied commencement. 

Administrators should lenglhen orientation , bring-
ing togcther freshmen from all live colleges . In stead 
of isolating students with college-specific prog ram -
ming, the frve colleges shou ld pool their mo ney for 

• large, campuswide events. The a ll -campus dance dur-
ing We lcome Week is nice, but it isn't enough . 

An all-campus graduation is a good idea, but it 
won't be the celebration that people want it to be 
unless the students have something to cele brate . 

Ullli l then , UCSD should stick with individua l co l-
lege ·c remonies. 

Students Need a Week to 
Prepare for Final Exams 

Students are franti ca ll y preparing for linal exams 
as the last few days of tenth week slip away. The 
rapid transition from regular c lasses into ex am week 
leaves slUdents with very little time to prepare for 
linals - often the most important part of c lasses. 
UCSD students need 11 "dead" wcek to adequately 
prepare for finals , meaning no c lasses. 

The entire campus would shut down , except for 
th l! libraries and study lounges, during thi s interim 
period - called a reading week at other uni versities . 
Only opti ona l review sessions would be offered dur-
ing thi s week - no mandatory lectures, labs, or tests. 

SlUdents would then have enough time to suf'li -
c ieml y and thorough I review the mate ri a l accumu-
lated over the ten-week quarte r, rather than mere ly 
regurg itate the material c rammed durin g late-night 
~ tudy sess io ns hou rs hefore the exams. 

For example, if a stud ' nt ha~ a tinal exam s heduled 
for Mo nday, she is I· ft with onl two d" s after the last 
Frida lecturc to prepare, The 'lUd ' lll oug ht to have 
more tilll \;! to adequately prepare rorexams, In additioll . 
some sllltiems are linishing their last "midtenns" dur-
ing temh week and should he given time \0 study new 
and untested infon11tttion before the linal exam. 

The i ~su e of how to integrate thi s ex tra week into 
the quarter sys t ' l11 hampers the implementatio n of a 
reading week . One 1>uggestio ll is to start th ' scho I 
year thre' weeks earli er. A ~hol1er sUlllmer vacation 
is a '>mall price to pay for in rea sed preparation .

I wish to t hank the Guardian for 

its attendant.:e and coverage of the 
Corporate Focus Group meeting 
with campus represenlatives. The 
group's report identilied strengths 
and weakncsses in the preparation 
of UCSD students for successful 
employment in the private sector 
and offered a numher of sugges-
tions for improvement. We are 
most gratcfulto the members of the 
group for their dedit.:ated efforts

Unfortunately, the Guardilln's

assert s that the meeting was the end 
o~ the di scU!,sion rather than the 
heginning of a long-term co ll abora-
ti on between UCSD and private 
sector employers. 

As explicitly stated, and agreed 
to at the meeting , a follow-up meet-
ing will be convened this spring. 
The agenda of that meeting wi ll be 
a discussion of the responses of the 
campus to the rcport 's findings and 
recommcndations. 

As stated several times during 
the mccting hy members of the 
Corporate Focus Group and UCSD, 
the meeting was an initial step in 
developing a long-term partnership 
between UCSD and the private sec-
tor to ensure that the best and 
hrightcst students are attracted to 
UCSD and Ihat they graduate with 
the knowledge and skills to he 
superb candidates for private sector 
employment.

Zoo Article Harmful 
And Erroneous 
Editor: 

Jessyt:a Wallat.:e's uninformed 
attack on the San Diego Zoo pub-
lished in the March 9 issue of the 
Gllardia/l is full of errors of fact 
and reveals how sloppy journalism 

has the potential for great harm. 
The not -for-profit Zoological 

Society of San Di ego (San Diego 
Zoo, Wild Animal Park and Center 
for the Reproducti on of 
Endangered Spec ies) and other 
lead ing zoos have become the only 
horne and hope for several animal 
spec i e~ that have di sappeared 
cntirely from the wild. The society 
tries to help such species until they 
can be safely reintroduced: Arabian 
oryx, Preswalski's horse, 
Califomia condor and Tahitian blue 
lory arc among their success sto-
ries. 

Wallace's statement that zoos 
are no longer necessary because 
"Humans have documented every 
aspect of every spet.:ies of animal s 
known". and this dot.:umentation is 
availab le on the Inlernet" is simply 
wrong and irresponsihle. Wrong, 
for obvious reasons, and irresponsi-
ble becausc it perpetuates the myth 
that animals will survive in nature 
without our help. 

Wallace's opinion "wc should 
just leave the animals to die in 
nature and let species evolve or 
become extinct ... [weI have no 
right to meddle in species salva-
tion" is a standard cliche used by 
animal -rights advocates because it 
appeals to those who cannot think 
it through. Educated rcaders quick-
ly figure out that she is saying we 
have the right to caus..: spec ies to go

informed Kleinb rodt of the coun-

Feeling that the MCC's dccision 
was unfair, Kleinhrodt said he tumed 
to A.S. Student Advocate Ritesh 
Khullar-instead of Muir Studcnt 
Advocate Jose Dias-filr help. 

"I went to Tesh hecause the let-

tinued. "Muir Council vo ted to 
ki ck me ofT, so I turned to the A.S. 
student advocate for help ." 

The cuse went before the A.S. 
Judicial Board last Wednesday. 

Khullar liled a pretrial motion to 
exclude Dins from the hearing, argu-
ing that according to the MCC 
bylaws, the student advocate should 
not be allowed to prosecut e student s. 

'The student advocate shou Id

level. prosecuting against a stu-
dent." 

The A.S. Judicial Board sided 
with Khullar and gave Hannickel 
extra time to prepare and present 
her casc without Dias. 

The A.S. Judicial Board ruled 
in favor of Kleinhrodt , noting that 
he was ncver notifi ed of hi s mis-
conduct in writing. 

According to Muir Dean Chips 
Dreilinge r, thi s interpretation is 
due to it dilTerence in procedures 
hetwccn the A S. and the MCC. 

"Muir Coum.: il is built on infor-
mality and tru~t ," he said . ' 'The 
[initi al I e-mail servcd as thc notifi-
cation I to Kleinbrodtl·" 

In addition, Hannickcl said the 
Muir bylaws do not require formal , 
written notification of thc offi ce-
holder to be removed. 

"[The lelter[ is not necessary 
for rem oval ," she said . "We com-
pletely followed our own internal 
procedures in the process." 

Fecling that the A.S. Judicial 
Board ruling was unjustified, 
Hannickel fil ed a formal complaint 
against the hoard with Pcterson 

The UCSD Guardian 

last Friday. 
In her letter to Peterson, 

Hannickel said that Dias was her 
chosen reprcsentati ve at the hear-
ing. She stated that she was enti-
tled to Dias ' assistance in accor-
dance with the UCSD Student 
Hearing Handhook. 

Khullar said he is worried ahout 
the kind of prccedent that the mi s-
tri alm:IY set. 

"The student ad vocate's pur-
pose is to defend student s and 
when that purposc is skcwcretl, it \ 
going to hurt th e integrity of the 
student ad vocate's offi ce as it 
whole anywhere," he said . 

However, Dreilinger said he 
hdi.:ves the Muir student ad vocate's 
position is defined hy the MCC, nOl 
the A.S. As a result. he said that the 
MCC should be ahle to decid.: the 
role of its student advocate. 

"Muir College Council fee ls it 
is their authority to discipline their 
office rs:' Dreilinger said. "[On the 
other hand I students on A.S. feel 
that IMCC] is subordinate." 

At press time, Kleinbrodt had 
not yet dccided whether to appeal 
Peterson 's decision.

"The net result of what the 
plaintiffs are left with now is thm 
they can now go bm:k to court and 
try and prove thill there was a vio-
lati on, but it serves no other pur-
pose than proving that there was a 
violation." Blair said . "They can 't

Blair said he believes the case 
should be summarily dismissed. 

"It's a tremendous wasle of 
judicial resources and a waste of 
the regents' time," he said.

Tokuji said that h..: will lile a 
motion to compel the regents to 
answer questions undcr oath ahout

tions they may have had with

" If the regents didn' t do any-
thing illcgal , it's awfully funny 
that they have refused to answer 
questions that we have attempted 
to ask over and over ag<lin ahout 
their pre-meeting conversations

should just come clean now. To

doctors will also take periodic 
blood samples from the patients in 
the study. 

According to John Alksne, dean 
of the UCSD School of Medicine 
and vice chancellor for health st:i -
enccs. these blood samples "will 
give us the opponunity to link a 
clinical cancer prevention with 
hasic research ." 

The samples will be saved, 
stored and, as the data necomes

become available, will be taken to

sis, he added. 

In the future, the tests may help 
scientists identify those patients at

as well as learn some of the mole-
cu lar markers in the bloodstream 
that would allow doctors to make 
even earlier diagnoses of cancer.

Many chemicals in vegetables

one of the primary 
investigators of the 
study, the WHEL 
study is unique 
necause it is "the

Swamp Jazz from New Orleans 
Funk band GalactiC makes its way toward San Diego 

By Ilona Fass

Get ready for the best thing to 
happenlo the San Diego club scene 
si nce The Greyhoy Allstars -
Galac ti c, a fun k band thaI emerged 
siraighl fro m a c ity that some 
would argue knows jazz the best -
New Orleans. 

T he Guardian, always keen un 
keeping you line folks up 10 dale on 
Ihe hest loca l music in town, recent -

Iy tracked down Galac tic bass play -
er Rohen Mercurio. 

There are IwO th ings about Mer-
curio worlh mentioning ri ght ofT 
the bal. The Ilrst is his charm ing 
southern accent. The second is that 
he double majored in psychology 
and glasshlowing at Tulane Uni ver-
,i ty. 

But he didn ' t muve all the way 
fro m Washington D.C. to ew 
Orleans just for the glass. He and 

guitarist Je ff Raln.:s chose New 
Orleans for the music. Now, how-
ever, Mercurio sa id, "I want 10 huy 
a hous.: and stay here." 

Ga lactic were give n ~Jlccia l

Weekly and OjflJelll Magazine, 

B;IIboard Magalinc said of the 
sex tet: "Ascenda nt stars or the 
cdeclic music scene in New 
Orleans, Ga lact ic is a sensuous, 
swampy and plenty-tight source of 

9 

pan-cultural acid jazz like only the 
Crescent Cily could supply, One 
pany record that you put to leave 
on." 

Four years ago, hefore they rea l-
ized how' far they were headed, 
Gal;ctic were ~;lil ed Galactic Pro-

groups like Jimmy Smith and 
Grant Green and newer groups, like 
Critters Buggin ' for inspiration. 
The former, for the notes and feel; 
the latter for their usc of freedom, 

Like all good j azz, Galactic rely 
on improvisation, which according 

phylactic. Findi ng 
a new name 

proved to be a di f-
Ilcult task, So they 
didn ' l, 

"We just said, 
. Aw, fuck it -
let'. keep it Gal-

-sa id, " It 's j ust a

When you think of

"If we had to 
play the same 
way every night,

to Mercurio, is the 
only way they 
manage to keep 
their sanit y on the 
road , 

"11' we had to 
play th.: songs Ih.: 
same way every 
night , cveryone in 
the band would go 
crazy," he aid . " I 
don' t know how bands do it." 
other bands do it. 

you think of lillie 
bugs"" - Robert Mercurio 

They must just 
tun.: out and leI 

Besides Ihe nallle d lange, 
Ga lactic were orig inall y an instru -
menla l group - that is, until Dan 
Prothero, the producer of their lat -
c~ 1 CD, C{Joli,, ' Off, suggested that 
th y add some voca ls. 

So they took hi s ad vice and 
audi tioned Thcryl deC louet, who at 
thai ti me was "just sO llie guy who 
IVrote toons in a tiny lillie hole in a 
wa ll d ub ." Now nicknamed 'The 
Houseman: ' Mercurio sa id Theryl 
hasn't missed a gig since. 

Like most bands that make it 
hig, non ' of the members has had 
fo rmal training. 

"Wc've all learned from play ing 
with each other and play ing with 
differe nt people:' Mercurio said. 
"We all learn tunes to teach each 
other how 10 play." 

In addition, lhl: hand looh to 
Bluc-Note jazz as we ll as older 

their unconsc iolls takes over." 
All co llege graduatcs, the mcm-

hers of the band waited until they 
fini shed school to start touring, So 
far, so good. 

In facI, Galactic's intensive 
scheduling has allowed them to 
pl ay with play with some or their 
fa orite musicians, including The 
Meters, Maceo Parker, Tower, of 
Power, War, Johnny Watson and 
Walter Washington, 

What have some of the dmw-
backs heen'! According to Mer~u ­
rio, "too mU\:h Denny's and a lack 
of good food." 

If the success of Cooli,, ' OJ! 
and their popularity in cities like 
New York and Los Ange les is any 
indi ca t ion of performances to 
come, Galactic will he a big hit in 
San Diego, Look for them thi s

It's No Use Being Good 
Palmetto' fails to create a believable storyline 

By Nicholas Runco 
Senior Staff Writer 

Imagine a really long episode of "Mag-
num P.I. " - only "Magnum P.I. ·· was heller. 

"Palmello," the new thriller from direr.:-
tor Volker Sl.: hloendorfT. toys with some or 
the same mystery and intensity as the hit 
TV series. hut fall s short of rini shing the 
story. 

The storyline twists and turns through 
sticky situations throughout the enti re film, 
but it leaves the audience skeptical as to the 
real reasons hehind the charal.:ter's actions. 

"Palmello" mixes a reali sti c plot with 
some fantastical behavior by the I.:harae-
ters . But rather than heing entertained, the 
audience is lert I.:onfused. 

While the adors turn in adequate per-
formam:cs, they arc not enough to evoke 
sympathy from the audi ence. 

Consistently stupid del.: isi on-makin g 
can he somewhat hUlllorous when used in 
limited contexts , hut in this case, it only 
se rves to drag the plot down. 

The films stars Woody Harre lson as 
rel.:ently rel eased convict Harry Barber. A 
newspaper reporter with a chip on hi s 
shoulder, Harry returns home after two 
years of wrongfu l imprisonillent only to 

fi nd more trouhle. 
"Palmello" .s set in Harry's hO/lletown 

of Palmett o, Fla., a locati on kn own for it s

Upon hi s return , he find s thing~ just as 
he left. Even hi s gi rlfrie nd Nina (Gi na Ger-

Life is sure is sweet. 
That is, until Harry crosses paths with 

Rhea Malroux (Eli sabeth Shue), who is out 
to get her rich husband 's money and wants 
Harry to help. 

At this point, a heauti fully set up story 
goes awry. 

The sc ript. based on the novel Just

fai Is to make the leap to the big saeen as

Breaking the Law 
'Us Marshals' escapes from the action-movie mold 

By Asaph Amir 
Gu ardian Reporter 

In 1993. Tommy Lee Jones WOIl al.:(;o-
lades for hi s ro le in the fast-paced 
action/thriller "The Fugitive" opposi te Harri-
son Ford . Jones played the dedicated U.S. 
Marshal. Samuel Gerard, who dogged ly pur-
sued a federa l fu gi ti ve (Ford ), an innocent 
who only sought to clear his name. 

In the newly released spin-off "U.S. Mar-
shals." Jones reprises hi s Oscar·winning role 
as the terse. uncompromising, but highly 
competent, marshal who must now pursue a 
fugitive played by Wesley Snipes. The film 
is a pleasant surprise in that even wi thout 
Ford's star attraction, the lilm is equally as 
credible and entellaining as its forerunner. 

As in "The Fugitive," Jones lends human-
ity and humor to hi s ro le in creating one of 
the most appealing characters in recent fi lm. 

One di sappointment with "Marshals" is 
that it recycles many of the old plot materi-
als from "The Fugi ti ve," ri ght down to some 
of the exact same lines. Yet the film remains 
independently viable without the sli ghtest 
mention of the origi nal film 's events. Oddly 
enough, those who ha ve not seen ' 'The Fugi-
ti ve" will perceive more originality and 
might enjoy "Marshals" even more than vet-

eran viewers of the origi nal fi lm. 
One other drawback is a so mewhat 

sketchy role for Snipes as Ford \ replace· 
ment fugiti ve . However, it is clear fro m the 
stal1 that whi Ie Ford was at least the nomi-
nal star of "The Fugiti ve." Jones. not Snipes, 
is clearly the main star of this lilm. Hence 
the reversal of movie titles from the focus 
on the hunted, the fu gitive, to the focus on 
the hunter, the marshal. 

Overa ll , despite some minor prohlems, 
thi s film retains a consistently high level of 
drama and suspense. Most importantly, 
"U.S. Marshals" restores some much-need-
ed credibility to the quality-starved action 
genre. The film avoids going the way of 
Illost recent action fillll s that have mimicked 
the surreal stylized violence of Hong Kong 
act ion cinema. 

Films like "Face/OfT," "Con Air" and 
"The Replacement Killers" all sacrifice plot , 
depth and credihility for shallow comic-
book melodrama. By relying on tired trade-
marks of affected-slow Illotion shots, gim-
mi cky firearm-acrobatics and ludicrous 
stunts, those film s push the limits of the sus-
pension of dishe lief. Fortunately, "U.S. 
Marshals" offers a more appealing and real · 
istic alternative.

Bonkers for Yonkers 
Neil Simons 'Lostin Yonkers' plays at the Avo Theatre

Ne il Simon 's "Lost in Yonkers," presented 
hy the Moonlight Amphitheat re, is onc of 
those rare plays that 's so good , you forget th at 
you arc sitting in the theater and not pet.:ping 
through your next-door neighhor's window. 
In other words, there is no dead time when 
you si t twiddling your thumbs, fl oating in and 
out of consc iousness and wondering when the 
intermi ssion will he. 

This effect is achieved hy a w mbination of 
elements. The actors give nat ural perfor-
man.:es; the plot is hoth intriguing and hiller-
sweet ; and the set looks like the inside of a 
real home. 

Many of the scenes would he impossihle if 
the at.:tors we ren' t so well-equipped to handle 
them. 

It is espec iall y impressive that this same 
level of profess ionalism and talent is exhihit -
ed hy the two youngest members of the cast, 
Todd Jones (Jay Kurnitz) and Gabriel Oliva 
(Arty Kurnitz) ages 16 and 13, respcl.: ti vely. 

The story unfolds in a two-bedroom apart -
ment over the Kurnit z Kand y store in 
Yonkers, New York , in the year 1942. Eddie 
Kurnitz (Eric Ander~on) , a single father of 
two boys, is in seri ous trou ble with the moh.

grandmother. Thi s i ~ not the kind of grandma 
who hake~ coo kie ~ and likes to cuddle ; slw 's 
the kind of grand ma who could run hoot

But therc 's a reason for hcr wrath . Grand-
ma Kurnitz (10 Black-Jacob) grew up in Ger-
many during World War I and endured so 
many hardships, she developed an iron-li st 
personality. Her parenting skills'are ahrasive 
to say the least. 

The result is that her six chi Idren have 
developed severe emotional s,;ars . Under-
standuhly, her two grandchi Idren, Jay and 
Arny, arc scared to dcalh to li ve with her. 

Grandma has no fri ends or other company 
except for her 35-year-old daughter Bella who 
still li ves at home. Bella is hea lthy in all ways 
hut one; she has the mental capacity of a 
child. Bella will never grow up. 

In their struggle to survive their stay at 
Grandma's, Arny and Jay realize a few things 
ahout themselves and abou.t life .

the men were seniors, leaving a

In contrast to the men's relatively

At the NCAA Weslern Regional 
Finals, Ihe Trilons finished a 
respectab le Ihird plal:c hehind Slan -
ford and thc Air Force Academy in a 
ficld of five teams. UCSD did man-
age 10 lrod on Ihe dreams of IWO leams, CSU 
Fu llenon and Cal Tech Uni versilY. 

Comprised of fi ve evenls - men's foi l. 
mcn 's epe!:, men 's saber, women's foil and 
women's cpee - the competition IOlals each 
individual 's record in every event 10 give a 
tinallcam score. Each alhlele fences individ-
uals from all Ihe other teams to give Ihem a 
record in the even!. 

In the men's foil , UCSD placed second 10 
Slanford as sial wan Tedd Padgill wenl 6-4, 
securing founh place individually in Ihe evenl 
and a henh in Ihe NCAA Nalionals . 

This is Padgill 's lirsl year wilh Ihe leall1 
and he only fenced half Ihc season. He ended 
with Ihe hest winlloss ralio in the con ference. 
Pr!:viously in a national circuil event. he 
placed eighlh in Ihe U.S. men 's ep!:e. whidl 
makes him well-experi enced for Na li onals. 

Teammates Jack ie Ngo and Selh Goldman 
placed fifth and Illh resp!:clively. at Weslern

Ihe women's epee team snagged second rlace

Our NCAA Tournament Spectacular, Baby 
By Travis Hili 
Spores Edieor 

OK, wipe the drool from your mouths. 
We know it 's hard , hu t try to M.:llle your-
sel ves. The tournament is here ... and all hell 
i, about to hreak loo,e. 

The main que_ti ons on every UCSD 
sport s ran 's mind arc. " Why now'! What did 
we do to deserve Ihis'! Why doc~ the tourna-
ment have to start today,!" 

As student,. we have all or thi s work to 
do and now. we aren ' t going to get any of it 
done. 

(Editor\ note: in the Gllon/ion Sports 
Department alone, our grades drastically 
drop during winter quarter. This is due to a 
I:omhination of depression over foothall end-
ing, elation over haseba ll starting and a 
severe case of March Madness that has us all 
horde ring on mental retardation for ahout 
two weeks. ) 

Some innol:ent souls that don' t know 
might ask, " What 's the tournament'!" How-
ever, ror the sports fan , there is no need to 
say "NCAA Division I Men's Basketball " 
before " tournament" for c1arifkation. The 
tournament is a 64-team extravaganza where 
anything can and will happen. 

Cullege hasketball right now is every-
thing that college foolhall is nol. While spec-
ulation. sports writers and polls del:ide which 
is the nation's top foothall squad, the tourna-
ment rorces the nation's best basketballtcam 
to rear ib head through the nets it gets to cut 
down in early April. 

There arc 64 teams that can win it . hut 
only one will rattle olT six wins in a row to 
claim the title. The t e n ~ion is unparalleled in 
all o f sports, and it all start s today ...

Words alone cannot do justice to

women's soccer team. 

In all, they have helped Ihe pro-
gram etch its name as the hest in 

Kate Larsen and Toni Nunc!: 
provided steady leadership in the 

Martee.a Gee,...,.: 
This four-year starter from 
Pasadena usually marked 
the opposing team 's best 
player on offense . Known 
for her toughness and 
relentless pursuit of a play, 
she played through many 
injuries in her time as a Tri· 
ton . She also represented 
the squad in TAC (Triton 
Athletic Conference) meet· 
ings . Her strong play in the 
L-~~ ____ -' back and her leadership 

midfield and crea ted plays for 
quick forwards like Alison Hurley. 
The " burley on '," Hurley, how\!v-

a deal with admini stration 10 return 
for a shot at a rounh erown. Jodie 
KnOll and Brenna Cox provided a 
great one-Iwo punch ofT Ihe bench 
and were a steady influence in the 
middle of Ihe field. 

Triton domination has hccollle a 
status quo in women's soccer. Head 
Coach Brian M cManus' crew 
swrcd 53 goals thi s seasun. while 
only giving up 7. On six different 
occasions, UCSD scored more than 
4 goals, a rari I y in succer. 

The season included a seven-
gallic winning streak and an eight-
game stretch. UCSD did not lose a 
si ngle home contest and hasn ' t 
dOlle so in a year-and-a-halr. 

All that remains to ponder is 
which term sounds heller: Four-
peat , or Back-to-Bm:k-to Back-to 
Back. 

Beth FreeburC: 
Arguably UCSO's best 
defensive player ever, this 
sweeper from Pasadena 
earned most valuable 
defensive player in the 
NCAA Tournament the pre-
vious two seasons. A sec-
ond·team All-America hon· 
oree this season, she also 
ta llied 7 goals in 1997 -
good for second·best on 
the team. A true stopper 
on defense. Head Coach 

was crucial to UCSO's success on the field . She will 
graduate with a history degree and take three 
National Championships with her. 

Brian McManus will be hard·pressed to find anoth· 
er speedy, tough defender who will play injured any 
day of the week.

ROUT: The Tritons trampled over University of Redland. to the 
tune of 26-9, including 7 RBIs for designated hitter Eric Schramm 
By John Maynard 
Staff Writer 

Tuesday's game agai n!>t the University of 
Redlands was more like balling practice for the 
Tritons. With 26 runs on 26 hits, the Trilons had 
a field day on thc Bulldogs ' belea-
guered bullpen. 

After being denied by the Red 
Hawks of Montclair State (Pa.) last 
Sunday, UCSD showed other Division 
III teams it they had some big bats, as 
the Tritons thwarted the Bulldogs, 26-9. 

"The Redlands came into Tuesday 's 
game with a good record ," Head Coach 
Dan O'Brien said. "Wit h this win, we 
made a big statement in Division 111." 

"We ha ve a high-caliher olkn)'e," 0 ' Brien 
said . "When we arc swinging our hatl>, we can 
dcfinit 'Iy do ~omc damage - espe~ i a ll y when 
our four, live and six bailers arc hilling strong." 

in it s seventh victory of the ~ea~() n , SD 
came out big, scoring 3 runs in the top 
of the first. 

Mason's single to center fi e ld 
brought the first two Tritons home. 
D'signated hiller Tony Lin dro ve in the 
third run for SO on an RB I single. 

However, before the Bulldogs let 
the gallic get ut of hand, they came 
back in the bollom of the Iir~t with 
Mlille scori ng of their own, dri Ving 1114 

runs olT Triton starter Eddie Ishak. 
Although SD was down hy a rUIl goi ng

The Bulldogs managed another pair of run~ 
in the bottom of the second, but it would he their 
last runs for three inn ings and the last time Red-
lands wou ld he wllhin 10 runs of UCSD.

pahle. 

Before one out wa!'. cOlllmilled, the TrilOn~ 
went th rough eight batters, \coring 5 rum, in the 
process. DU ring all th i~ mess, the Bulldogs were 
not helping their own cause, giving up 2 walb 
and an error.

for its important games in thi s weekend 's Ca li -
fornia Cla~sic ; a 10-team Divis ion III tourna-
ment including laremont , La Verne, Menlo, 
Occidental , Pomona-Pitler, Redlands and Whit-
ti er. 

After Tuesday's romping of the Bulldogs, the 
Tritons have buill themselves some confidencc 
going into thi s weekend 's tournament in Clare-
monl. The Tritons arc al 0 looking ahead to the 
pos t sea~o n . 

" It 's our region to win if we want it ," O' Brien 
said. "This weekend there are three teams in our 
hracket, and hy bculing them we will greatly 
increase our chance of gelling a post season 
bid." 

D will sec if the playoffs become more 
of a lea lity, as the Tritons will lake the field 

wi nging earl y Saturday morning. 

With the NCAA tournament
