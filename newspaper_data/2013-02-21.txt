Around 20 students attended a town hall meeting about the growing UC Student Health 
Insurance Program deficit Tuesday, 
Feb. 19.

Senior Physician Diplomate Dr. 
Gina Fleming, Campuswide Senator 
Matt Mayeda and co-chair of the 
Well-being Cluster Student Advisory 
Board Pauline Nuth led the 90-min-
ute meeting in the Student Services 
Center multipurpose room, which 
consisted of a presentation regarding 
the history of UC SHIP, the current 
deficit problem and proposed solu-
tions to stabilize its fiscal future. A 
moderated Q-and-A session with the 
audience followed the presentation. 

After adding the undergraduate 
component of the UC SHIP program 

in 2010, deficit grew to the current 
systemwide projected gross deficit of 
$57.41 million. UCSD’s total deficit 
of $15.9 million makes up 27 per-
cent of the total UC SHIP deficit. 
Last year, the systemwide deficit was 
roughly $25 million. According to 
Mayeda, Nuth and Fleming, the UC 
Office of the President will have to 
increase SHIP fees for the 2013–2014 
academic year for both graduate and 
undergraduate students in order to 
stop the rapid rise of SHIP’s deficit. 

Mayeda said that due to a lack of 
cost control, the plan is progressively 
losing money each year. In five years, 
it is estimated that the SHIP pre-
mium will increase from the current 
undergraduate premium of $1,156 
to $2,231 per year and the gradu-
ate premium from $1,781 to $3,440 
per year. Since adopting UC SHIP, 

enrollment in SHIP has dropped 
from 64 percent to 60 percent.

“If it drops another 4 percent, 
we will lose $175,000 to $200,000 — 
money we rely on for provider sala-
ries,” Mayeda and Nuth explained in 
their PowerPoint presentation. 

According to Fleming, some 
possibilities to decrease SHIP costs 
include instituting more expensive 
premiums, separating undergraduate 
and graduate plans and diversifying 
the program’s administration over 
different UC campuses. 

“The bottom line is we need a 
plan for our students that will be 
beneficial and helpful, and [we need 
to] move forward with it,” Fleming 
said at the event.

Penny Rue Will Depart 
for Wake Forest University

Yudof  to UC Faculty: No 
Salary Increases in 2012-13

The Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs, who began 
working at UCSD in 2007, will leave after Spring Quarter.

Despite a projected increase in funds from Calif. 
government, no UC employees will see raises this year.

After serv-
ing over five 
years as Vice 
C h a n c e l l o r 
for Student 
Affairs, Dr. 
Penny Rue is 
leaving her 
a d m i n i s t r a -
tive position 
at UCSD effec-
tive June 30, 

2013. She will begin her new role at 
Wake Forest University in Winston-
Salem, N.C. as a faculty member 
and Vice President for Campus Life 
in mid-July.

According to Rue, she will be 
taking this position mainly as a 
result of an attractive package 
offered by Wake Forest that will 
allow her to have more creativity in 
her new roles.

“This was a very hard decision 
for me; I love UCSD very much, and 
I have great colleagues,” Rue said. 
“But I was presented with a really 
terrific opportunity, and so with a 
heavy heart, I’m going to take that 
opportunity.”

Rue came to UCSD in Sept. 2007, 
and has been a leader in improving 
the well being of students, strength-

ening the campus community, pro-
moting diversity and overseeing 
student services and organizations. 
According to a statement released 
by Chancellor Pradeep K. Khosla, 
Rue was instrumental in the Student 
Affairs strategic planning process, 
administering strategic budget 
reductions, as well as raising over 
$6 million in scholarships and $18 
million for Student Affairs overall.

As VC-Student Affairs, Rue ini-
tiated special programming events, 
such as Family Weekend and Siblings 
weekend, as well as communicating 
with individual students and initiat-
ing student leader lunches. 

Rue also worked closely with 
Alumni Affairs and the Office of 
Research Affairs, and helped in cre-
ating the award-winning Institute 
on Building Communities for Social 
Justice Practice along with the 
Campus Community Centers and 
the Diversity Working Group.

In addition, under Rue’s watch, 
the number of student organizations 
increased by 30 percent and study 
abroad programs saw a 15 percent 
increase in student participation.

“I have so many memorable 
moments at UCSD — my first 
Sun God Festival was certainly an 
amazing, eye-opening experience,” 

Despite an expected increase 
in funding from state government, 
UC employees will not see any sal-
ary increases this fiscal year. UC 
President Mark G. Yudof announced 
the news in a Feb. 19 release shared 
with UC employees.

“I remain committed to imple-
menting a systemwide salary pro-
gram for staff as soon as the UC bud-
get can support one,” Yudof wrote in 
the letter. “Last year, we were able to 
implement general salary increases 
for non-represented employees for 
the first time in many years, and it is 
my hope that we will be able to offer 
a salary and merit program for the 
2013–2014 fiscal year.”

Yudof, who announced his res-
ignation last month effective in 
August, informed employees of 
the news that no UC employees, 
including chancellors and other 
high-ranking UC faculty and staff 
members, would see higher pay-

checks. This statement came a 
month after California Gov. Jerry 
Brown unveiled a budget plan that 
allocated more funding for UC and 
CSU campuses.

While this year marks the first 
since the governor took office that 
a proposed budget included a sur-
plus, state employees had previously 
received mandated furloughs and 
pay cuts. Yudof said that while UC 
administrators elected not to insti-
tute pay cuts, future fiscal decisions 
will still be subject to the state’s 
economic climate.

“It is important to remember 
that we are not alone in our bud-
get challenges and that employers 
everywhere are struggling to bal-
ance coping with serious financial 
difficulties while also properly 
rewarding their employees,” Yudof 
wrote. “We need to be mindful of 
the continuing economic challenges 
confronting California.”

Fleeting thoughts By Irene Chiang

Quite Frankly By Lior Schenk

Gantenerumab is a new Alzheimer’s 
drug currently being used in the 
Scarlet Road clinical study to slow 
the progression of the disease. UCSD 
researchers have found that the use of 
volumetric MRI helps diagnose and 
track the progression of Alzheimer’s 
disease in patients.

The UCSD School of Medicine’s 
department of neurosciences is one of 
the centers participating in the clinical 
trials with Gantenerumab, led by the 
Scarlet Road study — a global clinical 
study of the drug.

Gantenerumab is used with 
patients who have not yet hit the 
dementia stage of Alzheimer’s disease. 
Specifically, these patients have pro-
dromal Alzheimer’s disease — a sub-
group of mild cognitive impairment, 
or MCI. Patients with prodromal 
Alzheimer’s disease have trouble with 
memory and have specific biomarkers 
in their brain, which, according to the 
Scarlet Road study, indicate disease 
processes or response to therapy. 

“It is hoped that by treating early, 
we can prevent them from reaching 

the dementia stage of the disease,” 
UCSD assistant professor of neurosci-
ences Dr. Michael Rafii said.

 Gantenerumab binds and then 
removes beta-amyloid from the brain.

“The clinical study is evaluating 
a monoclonal antibody that binds to 
beta-amyloid. The buildup of beta-
amyloid in the brain is thought to be 
the underlying cause of Alzheimer’s 
disease,” Rafii said.

There are 100 sites across the 15 
countries that are currently conduct-
ing this study. Patients participate in 
the study for approximately two years.

At UCSD, researchers have helped 
this study through their research with 
volumetric MRI, a type of MRI that 
measures memory centers of the brain 
and compares them to the expected 
size. Dr. Anders Dale and Dr. Jim 
Brewer, both professors researching 
within UCSD’s department of neuro-
sciences, worked with Dr. Rafii on the 
research. In the study, the volumetric 
MRI allowed the researchers to mea-
sure regions of the brain, which helps 
identify patients with Alzheimer’s dis-
ease before they begin to experience 
dementia.

“[The volumet-
ric MRI] allows for 
earlier detection of 
Alzheimer’s disease 
in the brain, before 
the dementia stage 
occurs,” Rafii said. 
“The use of immu-
notherapy represents 
an exciting way of 
treating Alzheimer’s 
disease. Volumetric 
MRI is now becom-
ing a tool regularly 
used in the evalua-
tion of dementia.”

Rafii, Dale, 
Brewer and their 
team of researchers 
at UCSD have been 
studying Alzheimer’s 
disease for the last 
seven years, having 
published their work 
on volumetric MRI 
in 2009.

“We continue to recruit subjects 
for the study,” Rafii said. “We continue 
to work closely with Drs. Brewer and 
Dale on developing new techniques to 

better understand Alzheimer’s disease 
in its earliest stages.”

stressed the importance of student 
involvement in gathering informa-
tion regarding student health insur-
ance needs. 

“We want to know what are some 
of the parts of the plan that you can’t 
live without, and what are some of 
the things you’d rather see go away,” 
Fleming said. 

Mayeda and Nuth plan to inform 
the general student body — graduate 
and undergraduate — through edu-
cational campaigns, surveys and by 
sending out an informational letter 
to all students. 

“As your student representative, 
I’m really fighting, because I feel 
like this deficit isn’t UCSD’s fault,” 
Mayeda said. “It isn’t fair — we 
did not ask to join this. It isn’t our 

responsibility to pay this back.”
A survey is available on the stu-

dent health website that asks students 
which types of plans they prefer and 
which features of SHIP they believe 
are most important. Student health 
advocates will also be on Library 
Walk the rest of this week.

The African Black Coalition 
began its 10th annual three-day 
conference at Price Center this 
Friday, Feb. 15. The ABC, which is 
a student-run campus organization, 
first began holding these conferenc-
es in 2003 in response to academic 
underrepresentation, fee hikes, and 
the increase in hate crimes toward 
African-American students in the 
UC system.

This year, ABC elected to cre-
ate a conference environment that 
promoted practical career applica-
tions in the real world. For the 2013 
conference, organizers offered an 
industry networking night and a 
graduate school fair.

“The conference helps under-
graduates get the bigger picture — 
there’s a graduate side to that, an 
alumni side to that, and a business 
side to that,” Assistant Director of 
Alumni Programs and UCSD alum-
na Tamika Franklin said.

UCSD administrators from divi-
sions like the Cross-Cultural Center 
showed up to help at the conference. 
In particular, Edwina Welch, direc-
tor of the Cross-Cultural Center, 
conducted the opening plenary on 
Friday Feb. 15.

“I think it’s just a natural pro-
gression to graduate and go on to 
work at companies,” Welch said. 
“Being able to get that type practice 

at this conference is integral to their 
development in leadership.”  

Many students also attended the 
conference to make friends and net-
work with other African-American 
students from across the UC system. 
UCSD junior James Lee said that he 
attended the conference to experi-
ence a sense of tight community.

“Sometimes on this campus, it 
can be isolating for some black stu-
dents,” Lee said. “Here, students are 
allowed to come together and really 
feel like there’s people that they can 
connect and feel comfortable with.”

Rue said. “The second would be 
Convocation, as I looked out and saw 
the whole university come together.” 

As her last initiative before leav-
ing UCSD in June, Rue will focus on 
the ongoing university-wide strategic 

planning process that will continue 
throughout the spring and end in 
early June. 

She will also continue to work on 
individual student concerns.

“UCSD is always going to be in 
my heart,” Rue said. “I will continue 
to follow the trajectory of the uni-

versity, I will continue to root for it, 
and I will spread its news particu-
larly on the east coast, but I won’t 
have formal affiliations with the 
university.”

At last night’s A.S. Council meeting, AVP College Affairs Leonard Bobbitt showed us 
it is indeed possible to comb one’s hair 
seductively. And Marshall Senator 
Mariko Kuga and I realized we’re in 
the same American literature class. 
Shout out!

Special pre-
sentations began 
with the Student 
Sustainability 
Collective and a 
campaign called 
“Fossil Fuel Free UCSD.” Take note, 
Washington — all political movements 
should alliterate and rhyme.

SSC’s Energy and Waste director 
Allie Platt encouraged council to pass 
a resolution in support of divesting 
from the worst environmental offend-
ers in the energy industry, including 
Exxon Mobil, BP, and Chevron.

“Divestment is a call for the 
administration to be more transpar-
ent about the companies in which 
they have invested our money,” Platt 
said. “This holds them accountable for 
responsible investment practices.”

The collective emphasized that the 
companies not only contributed to cli-
mate change, but continuously engage 
in hydraulic fracking, mountaintop 
removal and other dedicated efforts to 
removing all that pesky nature.

The Green Initiative Fund contin-
ued this particularly environmentally 
friendly council meeting with an 
overview of two of the projects they’ve 
funded, Smart Garden and the Ellie’s 
Garden expansion.

Smart Garden is a fully automated 
garden sponsored by Engineers With-
out Borders at UCSD and will be built 
on the roof of Atkinson Hall in Earl 
Warren College. The student designers 
hope to have a prototype by the end of 
Spring Quarter 2013.

Ellie’s Garden is an existing student 
garden in ERC that is planning to ex-
pand. They will be bringing herbs and 
vegetables to a garden near the Europe 
and Latin America residence halls.

During this presentation, Guardian 
News Editor and purveyor of magic 
and happiness Zev Hurwitz brought 

me a Cherry Pepsi. 
And for the second 
council meeting 
in a row, my edi-
tors nonchalantly 
lingered behind 

me as I typed. (Editor’s note: We’re 
watching you.)

Following special presentations, 
council returned to discussing SSC’s 
resolution, with Platt urging members 
to act immediately.

“This movement is going and 
growing, and now is the time to push 
for it,” she said. 

Council eventually passed the 
resolution to raucous applause from 
the public. On a legislative roll, council 
moved to discussing the UCAB refer-
endum, with pressure to finalize the 
language for the spring ballot. Council 
voted to include an amendment speci-
fying funding for the reopening of the 
Crafts Center.

Part of the new language mandates 
that UCEN will open fundraising ef-
forts to support the Crafts Center and 
match the money that is raised. De-
spite objections concerning UCEN’s 
limited budget, council moved 
forward with its language changes, 
sending the resolution back to GSA.

Campuswide Senator Matthew 
Mayeda then reported tentatively 
excellent news that additional meet-
ings have been scheduled to discuss 
changes to SHIP.

“Thank goodness we fought back,” 
he said. “We may be seeing an oppor-
tunity for more student input.”

Serenades, for those outside the bubble, are when each new pledge class from the 
Interfraternity Council and the 
Panhellenic Council organizes and 
performs a choreographed dance for 
all of the chapters in the opposite 
council. Last week PHC announced 
that these serenades are no longer per-
mitted. The timing of the announce-
ment was a little off — a couple 
sororities had already put in time 
rehearsing their routines. Worse, we’ll 
never see an entire pledge class lose 
their shit to the Harlem Shake. 

But, dear reader-bros, UCSD 
Greek culture will find another way to 
introduce all of the members of each 
chapter at one time and place. Some 
chapters have always wanted to opt 
out of serenades but none wanted to 
single themselves out as “that chap-
ter” that didn’t partake. PHC, which 
is enforcing the new policy, comes 
off as the bad cop. But this gives 
unwilling chapters the opportunity to 
spend their new members’ valuable 
time elsewhere. While Greek leaders 
may understand why serenades had 
to go, the rank-and-file backbone of 
the Greek system is probably more 
bummed about the change.  

The Greek system is comprised 
of 37 chapters housed underneath 
three councils: IFC, PHC and the 
Multicultural Greek Council. Each 
council has policies for their respec-
tive chapters, but each chapter is 
also responsible for complying with 
guidelines set by their national offices. 
Clearly, there can be conflicts when 
chapters are “bro-stricted” by both 
national and UCSD policy.  Two years 
ago, with a push from the then new 
Greek advisor, the UCSD Greek sys-
tem implemented REACH, a broad set 
of standards for each chapter to meet 
intended to hold lagging chapters 
accountable. REACH was then tied 
to Greek awards, giving each chapter 
a compelling reason to comply with 
these standards. But REACH and 
serenades both question the extent to 
which chapters should be left autono-
mous to do their own thing based on 
national guidance unrestricted by IFC, 
PHC and MGC policies.

REACH standards right now stand 
as a one-size-fits-all set of policies 
guiding every chapter.  Yet not every 
chapter strives to meet identical ends. 
AEPi’s — my frat’s — national mis-
sion statement encourages promoting 
“Jewish ideals, values and ethics.” We 
don’t get a lot of props from REACH 
for doing that, nor do we get a break 
when we miss REACH-affiliated pro-
gramming for it. As a result, AEPi can 
get boned when it comes to REACH. 
It’s as conflicting as deciding what to 
do about a midterm on Sun God. 

Given their prevalence in our 
Greek culture, maybe it wasn’t pos-
sible for serenades to be dealt with 
on a chapter-by-chapter basis. But 
the increased chapter autonomy with 
chapter-specific policies on everything 
else will give Greek chapters more cre-
ativity in carrying out their national 
duties while still promoting invaluable 
leadership opportunities. So here’s my 
suggestion: We need more than one 
Greek advisor. Other schools with the 
same Greek population size as UCSD’s 
have more than one staff member to 
work with Greeks. The advantages of 
developing policies specific for each 
chapter should give admin reason to 
think about investing in our under-
funded Greek life.

Buffet-Style Works at Other Colleges, But Not at UCSD 

Becoming a 
Greener Machine

Divesting from coal-mining companies will increase UCSD’s economic sustainability, but 
our campus can make even more concrete changes to reduce its carbon footprint. 

With the climate crisis now at the fore-front of student-activist concern, the initiative to encourage sustainable 
practices has thankfully become more popular 
among college campuses — but we are not yet in 
the clear.

On Wednesday evening, A.S. voted on the 
UCSD Student Sustainability Collective’s proposal 
to divest coal-mining companies from UCSD 
funds. According to www.wearepowershift.org 
(the official website of one of the nation’s lead-
ing campaign groups for sustainable practices in 
Universities), students should pressure their col-
leges to cut financial ties with the coal industry in 
an attempt to diminish coal’s influence and finan-
cial power and to curb its damaging pollution. 
In this spirit, the SSC also proposed that UCSD 
reinvest these funds in eco-friendly, sustainable 
energy companies such as those in the wind or 
solar power businesses. 

It was imperative that the divestment pass for 
a number of reasons. According to Power Shift, 
there are 21,000 deaths and 24,000 hospitaliza-

tions each year in the U.S. that can be attributed 
to the ecological effects of burning coal. Mining 
and burning coal also damages the environment, 
as coal is the largest U.S. contributor to worldwide 
greenhouse gas pollution. What’s more, investing 
in coal is not economically sound. More than half 
of the coal plants in the U.S. are either in need of 
costly repairs or becoming old and inefficient in 
competition with increased long-term sustainable 
energy solutions.

But while this is an important step for UCSD, 
and divesting fossil fuel companies is certainly a 
positive goal, we can take more concrete steps as a 
campus to reduce our carbon footprint locally. 

Parking on campus is a nightmare, and the 
shuttle system is bleeding financially. What bet-
ter reason could you have to ride your bike to 
school? But alas, aside from a lack of motiva-
tion and the undeniable fact that UCSD is built 
upon one giant hill, many students who can ride 
their bikes to school don’t simply because UCSD 

See SuStainability, page 5

OVT’s failed implementation of all-you-care-to-eat dining is a marker of poor com-
munication between administrative 
decisions and student preferences.

Housing, Dining and Hospitality 
Services finally realized last month 
that its eyes are bigger than its stom-
ach and wisely opted to discontinue 
the frustration that was the all-you-
care-to-eat service of Oceanview 
Terrace dining hall in Thurgood 
Marshall College. 

The department quietly 
announced that OVT would return 
to a la carte dining operation at the 
beginning of next fall.

Different is good, thought 
UCSD administrators when they 
enacted the new policy late last 
summer and surprised incoming 
residents with the news that some 
meals in Marshall College would 
cost them over $10. For freshmen 
in residential halls, that’s nearly 
an entire day’s allotment of dining 
dollars. For on-campus apartment-
dwellers, one OVT meal puts them 
in the red for a day’s worth of din-

ing dollars. The one advantage: 
Reaching the “Freshman 15” has 
never been easier (as long as you’re 
prepared to pay for it).

At other campuses, like UC 
Santa Barbara, all dining halls are 
buffet style, which works because 
meal plans are a 14 or 21-meal-
per-week system versus UCSD’s 
pay-per-item policy. UCSD’s twin-
ning of dining halls with places 
and markets makes financial sense 
with an a la carte dining dollars 
program, but a hybrid system is not 
as fiscally conscious. While the idea 
of eating trays upon trays of stir-fry 
may seem tempting, our stomachs 
and wallets will appreciate a return 
to the old system.

The unlimited-buffet style of 
OVT dining was yet another exam-
ple of administrators making an 
impulsive and ultimately bad policy 
change with little to no prior notice 
to students. 

Fortunately, the other poor 2013 
situations — the proposed SHIP 
premium hikes and last month’s 
Transportation Services debacle — 

are both in talks that will include 
students in the decision-making 
process. In these cases, administra-
tors allowed services to run up high 
costs at too low a price to students 
in order for the services to remain 
sustainable. 

The OVT episode, however, was 
just a careless decision that likely 
made this year a tough (and expen-
sive) one for Marshall students. 

UCSD administrators need to 
stop making such impulsive deci-
sions, especially when the action 
takes a serious financial toll on 
students.

Talk has been floating around 
on the prospect of moving the all-
you-can-stomach dining program 
to Revelle College’s Plaza Cafe 
dining hall. Such a decision, with-
out being involved in discussions 
beforehand, would just reinforce 
that students are not the priority in 
administrative decision making. 

We deserve a seat at a discus-
sion table for big policy changes 
— especially if a seat at the table is 
going to be $10.99 at dinnertime.

offers very few accommodations for 
the commuting cyclist.

 Unlike UC Davis and UC 
Santa Barbara (both of which offer 
campus-wide cycling roads com-
plete with lanes, roundabouts and 
plenty of bike parking), UCSD has 
no designated bike paths. The only 
way into campus on a bike is up 
the steep and congested entrance at 
Via La Jolla or the equally cramped 
bike lane-less Voigt. More accom-
modations for cyclists could signifi-
cantly reduce the amount of carbon 
emissions on campus, while dually 
encouraging a healthy form of exer-
cise and transportation for student 
commuters.  

If biking to school isn’t a fea-
sible option for some, car sharing is 
another simple way that students can 
take responsibility for preserving the 
environment. Organizing carpools 
to and from campus is an extremely 
effective way to cut down on carbon 
emissions as well as gas prices (and 
make some new UCSD friends).

The car rental company Zipcar 
is also a fantastic alternative. 
Renters are given a “zipcard” which 
they use to unlock a rental car 
parked conveniently on campus. 
The payment and reservation pro-
cess is relatively cheap and can take 
place entirely on a smartphone. 
Zipcar even offers discount rates 
for UCSD students. According to 
Zipcar’s website, each zipcar takes 

approximately 20 personal vehicles 
off the road, and each renter saves 
an average of 219 gallons of gas 
per year. Visit www.zipcar.com for 
more information. 

Saving the planet will ultimately 
come down to individual responsi-
bility. At UCSD, we’re lucky to have 
on-campus organizations like the 
SSC that are willing to lobby for 
environmentally friendly practices 
such as divesting coal companies 
of UC money, but there’s a lot the 
individual student can do to con-
tribute. UCSD has often been rated 
one of the most economically sus-
tainable campuses in the country, 
so let’s live up to that reputation by 
also being one of the most ecologi-
cally sustainable.

halcyon days By Christie Yi LEttER  to  tHE  EdItoR

Dear Editor,
Mike McDowell, who has been 

heading the planning effort for 
Balboa Park’s yearlong celebration 
of its 1915 exposition, was only “on 
loan” from the San Diego Lodging 
Industry Association. 

“Recent events require a re-com-
mitted effort on my part to ensure 
the near-term survival and long-
term health of the hospitality indus-
try,” McDowell said on Feb. 19.

Obviously, the kiosks in Balboa 
Park with names of philanthro-
pists starting with Richard C. and 
Rita Atkinson aren’t meant to be 
associated in the public mind with 
perpetuating the legacy of the 
1915 Panama-Pacific International 
Exposition — access to open space, 
gardens, celebration of our heritage, 
naval history, a reduced entry fee 
to the zoo for children in 2015 (as 
stressed in Ellen Browning Scripps’ 
behests) — or an enhanced Pacific 
Rim emporium generally.

It’s all about hoteliers wanting a 
39-year tax regime who will sue a 
populist mayor to get it!

Whatever tourist industry 
groups there are in San Diego, they 
haven’t done a good job over the 
past five years. For the uninitiated, 
an important sports convention 
(one which could develop into the 
next Comic-Con) was held for three 
years in San Diego — followed by 
the last four years in Las Vegas.

George Maloof, chairman of Las 
Vegas Events, said he was pleased 
to greet those attending the USA 
Sevens Rugby Tournament and Fan 
Festival, held Feb. 8 to Feb. 10. 

“The best players from around 
the world, representing 16 nations, 
will vie for the cup at UNLV 
Stadium,” Maloof said.

Now, about those jobs lost to 
Las Vegas when the USA Sevens 
Rugby Tournament and Fan 
Festival relocated. 

“Here in America, rugby contin-
ues to gain popularity. Our rookie 
rugby programs have provided an 
entry point to the game for mil-
lions of youngsters ages 6 to 12 
years as they take part in both in-
school and after-school programs. 
Internationally, our top players 
are now moving to the full-time 
residency program at the Olympic 
Training Center just south of San 
Diego,” USA Rugby CEO Nigel 
Melville said.

“We are excited to have pro-
vided 10 hours of live courage ... 
special thanks to our sponsors 
and our partner hotels,” President 
of Programming, NBC and NBC 
Sports Network Jon Miller said. 

Carolyn G. Goodman, Mayor of 
Las Vegas, in her welcome found 
on page one of the USA Sevens 
Rugby Tournament and Fan Festival 
Official Program waxed poetic 
not only about the city’s entertain-
ment venues, but about the Lou 
Ruvo Center for Brain Health and 
the Charlie Parker, a new luxury 
boutique business hotel. Messrs. 
McDowell, Brown and Evans could 
move to Vegas and sue her.

Local Tourist Industries 
Have Done a Poor Job

More Biking, Carpooling and Zipcars Will Help Environment
▶ SuStainability, from page 4



W ith San Diego being so close to the Mexican border, it seems fitting that it should 
hold a guacamole competition in 
order to determine “Who makes the 
best guacamole?” If you’re a lover of 
this fleshy, green, pear-shaped fruit 
you must come down to Balboa park 
this Saturday and witness the event.

The “Guacamole Bowl” started 
10 years ago by retired San Diego 
police officer Matt Weathersby who 
sought to support local charities. His 
mission has been highly successful 
so far, raising over $67,000 for local 
programs for athletes with develop-
mental disabilities. Saturday, Feb. 23,  
will be the decennial anniversary of 
this curious competition and all the 
proceeds will go towards the charity 
Sports for Exceptional Athletes.

Currently there are 25 teams 
registered to participate in the event 
with some late entries possible. The 
teams will be made up of members 
of law enforcement, Kiwanis service 
clubs, restaurants and the general 
public who all have a shot at making 
guac. The top three teams in each 
division as voted by the popular vote 
will win a cooking medal and be 

allowed through to the final round 
where they will meet the official 
judges. The gold medal winners 
from the four major divisions (Law 
Enforcement, open, restaurants and 
Kiwanis) will compete once more in 
order to win the “Guacamole Bowl” 
Trophy, truly signifying who has 
mastered the challenge of creating 
the perfect guacamole. Not only do 
they receive the coveted trophy and 
annual fame, the team captain is 
awarded an avocado-green culinary 
jacket.

Smaller awards will also be hon-
ored: The best-decorated table will 
be carefully judged and a People’s 
Choice Award for the finest recipe 
across all divisions will result in an 
instant advance to the final round. 

It’s a highly serious event. Over 
2,000 avocados will be on site (kind-
ly donated by Calavo Growers Inc.). 
There are strict rules to how the gua-
camole should be prepared (i.e. no 
pre-chopping permitted) and what 
the teams will be provided with (12 
avocados, onions, jalapeno peppers, 
tomatoes, limes, cilantro and serving 
cups). Teams bring their own bowls 
and cooking utensils. Ice can also be 
brought on site to successfully keep 
the guacamole perfectly chilled. 12 

minutes is the official time limit for 
teams to prepare their recipe in front 
of official judges.  

Anyone can come and judge and 
try out the array of green goodness: 
For a $5 donation you can sample 
to your heart’s content with Mission 
tortilla chips. Doors open to the 
public at 10 a.m. and voting begins 
at 1:30 p.m. with the winners being 
announced around 2:30 p.m. 

“If you like good guacamole, and 
lots of it, then Balboa Park is the 
place to be,” Weathersby said. 

Come down on Saturday, Feb. 
23, to listen to the Chula Vista High 
School Mariachi Band and prepare 
to be bowled over by guacamole.

The Guacamole Bowl 

After a lot of thought and delib-eration, I have decided that this is the last installment of 
my column for a while, and maybe 
even forever. It is possible that 
This Modern Love will come back 
maybe in another quarter, maybe 
next year, maybe in another form, 
theme or title, but right now I am 
not too sure. 

This column started as a social 
experiment. I used my personal life 
as a guinea pig for the sake of writ-
ing. Above all, I am glad I have that 
ability. I think it will be helpful in 
my future career even it can be self-
depreciating at times. But it’s time 
I take my personal life out of the 
press and focus on reality. 

At first I thought I might just 
have writer’s block. Maybe my 
life was just a bit uneventful that 
month and I had nothing to write 
about. But that’s definitely not the 
case. 

 I have so much to say about so 
many things. It has been a year and 
a half since I started writing This 
Modern Love, which means I have 
grown up quite a bit and I have to 
be more selective with my writing. 

I could tell you in detail how 
much fun the Guardian’s trip to 
Las Vegas was this last weekend. 
I could tell you about the people 
I spent time with there and how 
they’re all amazing. 

I could tell you about how my 
mind has been racing with so 
many thoughts written all with the 
sarcastic tone I’ve utilized in the 
column. But I’m putting sarcasm on 
the sideline for now and focusing 
on sincerity (plus, would you really 
care?)

Whether in love or war, I have 
always used sarcasm as a defense 
mechanism.  (My Myspace user-
name circa middle school was even 
sarcastic_biotch. Yeah, it was that 
bad.). 

I think this is because I have 
avoided being 100 percent present 
for fear of being vulnerable. But 
to my surprise, I have learned that 
vulnerability doesn’t have to be so 
bad. It opens you up to new experi-
ences and emotions. And as much 
as I hate to admit it, realizing these 
things makes cliches feel not so 
cliche. 

I want to thank the Guardian 
staff for supporting my column 
and giving me helpful feedback. 
Your comments mean the most to 
me. You are my family. Thank you, 
readers, for coming back every few 
weeks to read my writing (even if 
most of the people who read my 
column are my oh so wonderful 
and supportive roommates). 

Thanks to all the great and hor-
rible guys that have been in my life 
to inspire some really interesting 
stories and experiences. Yes, even 
Jason* from the article “Jesus, Jail 
Time and the Three Day Rule.” 
Even though he put me through a 
unreasonably weird week, he gave 
me a lot to think (and write) about.

I really will miss writing this 
column. Even though I won’t be 
writing 600 words periodically on 
my life anymore, I will continue to 
think critically about the impor-
tant things in my life — as we all 
should. 

But above all else, I am very 
okay with not having to look at 
that weird drawing of my face next 
to my name every few weeks. I am 
definitely ready to let that die.

A Writer’s 
Eulogy for 
Modern 
Love
laira  martin lmm002@ucsd.eduthis  modern  love

W hen you’re looking to get some-thing as permanent as a tattoo or piercing, it’s important to find a 
reputable parlor so there are no regrets. 
Body modification can be a big invest-
ment financially and physically, so it’s 
worth it to seek out the best of the best. 
Luckily for UCSD students, there are 
plenty of local shops that can cater to 
each and every body modification need. 
The following four are some of the 
highest-rated and can all be found with-
in a reasonable distance from campus.

First on the list is Funhouse Tattoo. 
Located in the tattooing hotbed of 
Pacific Beach, as with most of these 
locations, it is still one of the most 
highly rated parlors around. Funhouse 
has a wide range of specialties, ranging 
from traditional tattooing in the well-
known Americana to black and gray 
portrait realism. The price, as with most 
tattoo parlors, depends on whether the 
tattoo is in color, what part of the body 
it’s going on and how sensitive the sub-
ject is. For Funhouse, the price often 
runs between $140 and $150 per hour. 
Currently, they have a running deal 

with Yelp for a $150 voucher as an extra 
bonus. They take walk-ins, but appoint-
ments are the best way to go.

Tattoo Royale is another parlor 
in Pacific Beach, but it stands out for 
its consistently high five-star rating. 
With three artists boasting a combined 
60 years of experience, Tattoo Royale 
offers a wide range of expertise and 
styles. From detailed, color portraiture 
blossoming with a frame of full-hued 
flowers to whimsically styled black 
and gray cartoons, the artists at Tattoo 
Royale can really bring a vision to life. 
The artists’ galleries are extensive and 
are available on the parlor’s website. 
Pricing varies along with the condi-
tions of application, as with Funhouse 
Tattoo. The beautiful craftsmanship and 
years of experience these artists provide 
is also worth the money. One of the 
artists, Guf, also has a T-shirt line for 
clothing to match a new tattoo. Tattoo 
Royale prefers appointments, but walk-
ins will likely be accommodated.

A tattoo parlor located outside 
the body-art hotspot of Pacific Beach 
is Mission Beach Tattoo, the self-

described first-ever tattoo and piercing 
shop in Mission Beach. According to 
the parlor’s site, many other shops have 
come and gone during the 15 years, 
but Mission Beach Tattoo has thrived. 
The artists at the parlor have a knack 
for Americana tattoos, but what really 
makes them stand out is the quality of 
their piercing service. With knowledge-
able staff and fair prices, Mission Beach 
Tattoo comes highly recommended for 
anyone in search of a piercing. They 
are willing to bring the price down if 
you bring your own jewelry, though 
it typically ranges from $20 to $40. 
Consultations are free, and no appoint-
ment is necessary.

The final location on the list is back 
in Pacific Beach — Sideshow Tattoo 
and Piercing. Sideshow’s knowledge-
able staff is more than willing to answer 
any questions about piercing services, 
and the clean working environment 
provides a safe place to make clients 
comfortable. As for tattoos, Sideshow’s 
seven artists offer traditional and cus

SNEAKY TIKI
The Guardian asked Ami, a 
bartender from Bar Pink in 
North Park for an easy and 

innovative cocktail. She 
recommended its in-house 

created Sneaky Tiki. 

This popular pink drink 
goes down easy and like the 
name says, it sneaks up on 
you. With its tropical tang, 
you will forget all of your 

troubles and be transported 
to paradise.

INGrEdIENTS

1½ ounces Malibu,
coconut rum

1½ ounces Amaretto,
almond liquor

3½ ounces sweet and sour
4 ounces fruit juice

Mix and serve in a 
16-ounce glass over ice, 

and decorate with a mini-
umbrella.

Try it with pineapple or 
guava juice for a tropical 

fruit flair.

Caffeine fiends have a little habit that’s hard to break: searching for the best coffee shops around. 
The hunt is a serious undertaking 
— caffeine fixes can’t be 
fulfilled just anywhere. 
It gets old defaulting to 
that Starbucks down the 
street, and on-campus 
joints like Perks and 
Peet’s just get too famil-
iar, especially when you 
start noticing your TAs 
studying there.

Cafe Bassam 
embraces the unfamiliar 
and shames those chain 
coffee shops we know 
all too well. Located 
in a low-key corner of 
Bankers Hill, it doesn’t 
conform to the feel of a typical coffee 
house. Stepping in through the door, 
you might experience a jumbled time 
warp, swirling in between flashes of a 
Diagon Alley shop, an old world tea 
room and a ’20s gift boutique. 

Ambiance reigns here; you’ll find 
paintings and Russian rifles covering 
the walls, vintage jewelry in cases next 
to the register, books and other mis-

cellaneous items stacked up almost 
to the ceiling (Ollivander would 
approve), two antique pianos adjacent 
to a couple of the tables and couches 
to further cozy up the atmosphere. 

The space fills with a mix of 
Bankers’ locals, SD col-
lege students and couples. 
Studying is doable with its 
Wi-Fi and a few outlets for 
laptops. Yes, it can get loud-
er and more cramped than 
Geisel, but the atmosphere 
compensates by feeling like 
the coolest living room in 
the city. 

Coffee choices are tra-
ditional — chai lattes seem 
to be a crowd favorite. The 
ordering process is refresh-
ingly laid back — just pay 
when you decide to leave. 
Night owls will be happy 

with the closing time: 1 a.m. every 
day except Sunday, the only day it’s 
closed.

The place is pretty musical, so 
don’t be surprised if someone decides 
to play some piano tunes unexpect-
edly. For a study break, check out 
Opera nights on the last Wednesday 
of every month and Tango nights on 
select nights.

Tattoo Artists Advise Conducting Extensive Research Prior to Inking or Piercing 

tom work both in color and black 
and grey. A middle-range tattoo 
runs about $75, and a piercing about 
$40. Sideshow takes walk-ins, and 
for anyone craving some ink in the 
middle of the night, the parlor is also 
open later of any of the shops, clos-

ing in the wee hours of two in the 
morning.

When asked, Sideshow’s own 
Keith, a tattoo artist for over 19 
years, said the best tip he could offer 
was, “Don’t pick out your tattoo 
while you’re drunk.” He went on to 
explain that if you’re seeking the best 
tattoo, you should be willing to go 

for something more impressive and 
labor-intensive. “More impressive 
tattoos are usually a lot longer-lived 
and appreciated more later in life 
than small, cheap tattoos — the 
wearer gets tired of those pretty 
quick.” In addition to that, the art-
ists advise someone seeking their 
first tattoo to do their own research. 

Call ahead to whatever parlor you 
choose, and make sure they have the 
best artists and resources to suit both 
your artistic vision and your bank 
account so you don’t find yourself 
regretting a decision.

AWARDs

Best    PiCtURe  nominations

What “Zero Dark Thirty” has to say about 
torture is not entirely clear. The community has 
had quite a lot to say about Kathryn Bigelow and 
Mark Boal’s newest collaboration, a controversial 
portrayal of the years leading up to the cap-
ture and subsequent death of Osama bin Laden. 
Questions involving Bigelow’s apparently “posi-
tive” bias toward the efforts of torture may have 
contributed to a Best Director snub, along with a 
general wariness to support a film that might be 
supporting waterboarding. But be careful what 
you wish for — if truth is what you want, it’s what 
you’re gonna get, and Bigelow is unafraid of mak-
ing that dead clear. What “ZDT” isn’t ambiguous 
about is the hell those operatives went through to 
take down not just Osama, but an entire terrorist 
operation. 

The sweeping deserts and malnourished con-
ditions of both hostage and host are hard to take 
in, and the hopeless time frame doesn’t help to 
alleviate this. Years go by, lead after lead goes 
nowhere, and still those ground operatives fight. 
Jessica Chastain’s determination is evident not just 
as a component of headstrong Maya, but also as a 
loud testimony to the importance of “ZDT.” The 
Best Actress nominee carries this film with a grace 
and strength that would seem implausible in her 
situation if not for the undeniable fire that brims 
beneath her lines: “If bin Laden isn’t there, you can 
sneak away, and no one will be the wiser. But bin 
Laden is there. And you’re going to kill him for 
me.” And Navy SEAL Team Six does. When they 
take down the Abbottabad compound, those final 
moments are quiet. Simple. It’s this simplicity and 
exposure that makes “Zero Dark Thirty” such a 
grating experience. We expect heart-pounding 
scores and perspiring facial close-ups. What we 
get is the exhaustion and conviction of the people 
who could never tell this story for themselves, and 
one woman’s tireless resolve to finish the job.

Zero   Dark   thirty

In David O. Russell’s “Silver Linings Playbook,” 
bipolar but relentlessly optimistic Pat (Bradley 
Cooper) embarks on a quest to reconnect with 
his wife through neurotic widow Tiffany (Jennifer 
Lawrence), resulting in a quirky and unexpected 
love. Russell keeps the camera work simple and 
the settings ubiquitous, drawing the audience in 
comfortably and allowing the story’s excellent char-
acters to interact organically. This bracing realism is 
sustained by a subtle soundtrack that enhances the 
ambiance without constantly reminding the audi-
ence that the drama unfolding is fictitious.

Though the story’s frank honesty in dealing with 
the complications of mental instability in modern 
relationships is both refreshing and interesting, it is 
the characters of “Silver Linings Playbook” that make 
it an excellent contender for Best Picture. Both blunt 
humor and raw vulnerability run through the film’s 
excellent script and lend a distinct feeling of plausi-
bility one doesn’t typically expect from Hollywood. 
Pat and Tiffany are well-written and believably 
drawn, but Cooper and Lawrence bring them to life, 
fleshing out these broken but hopeful lovers. The 
supporting cast only accentuates this, with Robert 
De Niro and Chris Tucker giving wonderfully subtle 
performances. It’s exceptionally difficult to make an 
audience smile while leading them to an uncomfort-
able reality of life, but “Silver Linings Playbook” does 
so with grace.

For those who haven’t seen “Argo,” it may be surprising that among the more memorable 
lines of this historical thriller is the mantra, “Argo fuck yourself,” or that Alan Arkin is nomi-
nated for Best Supporting Actor for a particularly wry, witty performance in the film — a stark 
contrast to several of the other more somber nominees. Despite the dark subject matter — a 
CIA plan to rescue embassy workers during the 1979 Iran hostage crisis — parts of the film are 
genuinely funny, and the unlikely method for getting the hostages back to the U.S. is just crazy 
enough to work. This balance is what makes “Argo” a film that is not only exciting on the first 
viewing, but also light enough to be just as enjoyable the eighth time around.

  Make no mistake, though: Often times “Argo” is gritty and suspenseful, and it climaxes 
with an incredibly gripping finish. Unlike many Hollywood thrillers, the nail-biting intensity 
never feels cheap, partly because so much of the movie is sharply realistic. In terms of character, 
the embassy agents are just as they would have been in reality. Unlike other nominees (such 
as “Zero Dark Thirty”), muted colors aren’t used to create a darker atmosphere, and the use of 
special effects is kept to a minimum. As a result, the film feels authentic visually. In all aspects 
an exceptional film, “Argo” is, at the very least, one of those rare Oscar nominees that will have 
you fidgeting in your seat while apprehensively chanting “oh shit, oh shit, oh shit.”

Having been described as the 
Rolls-Royce of the Oscar scene, 
“Lincoln” is arguably the favorite to 
pick up the award for Best Picture. 
While director Steven Spielberg has 
in the past created more amusing 
and emotionally seductive films, 
“Lincoln” is a bold and brave master-
piece, perfectly blending the political 
and the historical. The precision and 
lucidity make it an engrossing watch 
while it serves as a valuable history 
lesson, intently following the sec-
ond term of the 16th U.S. president. 
Daniel Day-Lewis offers a master 
class in acting as President Abraham 
Lincoln alongside Sally Field as first 
lady; Spielberg follows the last stages 
of the Civil War as the anti-slavery 
amendment struggles to pass through 
the House of Representatives. The 
outstanding cast, the gentle score 
by John Williams and Janusz 
Kaminski’s superior cinematography 
make “Lincoln” stand out in this 
legitimately contested race for Best 
Picture. The film resonates history 
and will no doubt go down in history 
more so than the other contenders 
in this race for the coveted title. 
Surely Spielberg’s engrossing drama 
deserves to trump its rivals with this 
weighty, flag-waving historical piece.

Despite its popularity as a stage production, 
if you asked the average student to tell you about 
“Les Miserables,” they most likely would only be 
able to sing you a snippet of “I Dreamed a Dream” 
instilled upon them via middle school choir. That 
is, until director Tom Hooper managed to attract 
both theater geeks and ordinary folk alike to see 
his sprawling two-hour-40-minute affair — an 
achievement in and of itself.

With a star-studded cast, Hugh Jackman 
anchors the film with a surprisingly nuanced 
portrayal of Jean Valjean, and Anne Hathaway 
delivers a short but incredibly heartbreaking 
performance which will hopefully earn her the 
Best Supporting Actress award. While there 
may be some missteps along the way, such as 
Russell Crowe’s indistinct singing, even this low 
point is infinitely more tolerable to the ears than 
Tarantino’s brief cameo as an (alleged) Australian 
in “Django Unchained.” And to Crowe’s credit, it 
should be noted that all the singing in the film 
is recorded live on set, a technical achievement 
never before done on such a scale.

Hooper channels his cast into a film that 
manages to balance the deeply personal with 
the sweepingly epic, resulting in a film that 
epitomizes filmmaking as grand spectacle. The 
intimate tale of Valjean’s redemption is set against 
the idealistic image of the June Rebellion, and 
the contrasting narrative strands deliver the most 
powerful emotional punch this year, making “Les 
Mis” the frontrunner for best picture.

Les   Miserables

Dieter Joubert
STAFF WRITER

Someone must’ve really pissed Quentin 
Tarantino off. The director’s last couple block-
busters (“Kill Bill,” “Inglourious Basterds”) 
have centered on exacting ridiculously violent 
revenge. “Django Unchained,” Tarantino’s latest 
offering, fits right into this mold. 

The pre-Civil War period piece centers on 
Django (a growling Jamie Foxx), a freed slave 
who joins forces with an eloquent German 
bounty hunter (Christoph Waltz) to rescue his 
enslaved wife. This story seems secondary to the 
main plot, though, which Django sums up with 
the line, “Kill white people, and they pay you 
for it? What’s not to like?” This mission takes 
“Django” from a spaghetti Western to a planta-
tion run by the deliciously despicable Messr. 
Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) and overseen by 
a bug-eyed, entirely anachronistic head house 
slave (Samuel L. Jackson).

When the film reaches the plantation, things 
get (more) violent. Because it’s Tarantino, this is 
really no surprise. But there are two treatments 
of violence here. There’s the typical ketchup-y 
bloodbaths, which are damn entertaining. But 
there’s also realistic violence, reserved for depict-
ing the atrocities of slavery, making parts of 
“Django” difficult to stomach.

The moral dimensions of “Django” go deep-
er than depictions of violence, though. Django’s 
partner is likeable, but he revels in his “corpses-
for-cash” business. Django himself acts as a 
brutal slave trader in the singular pursuit of 
his wife. In short, this film demands intense 
moral flexibility of its viewers. This complexity, 
paired with Tarantino’s brilliant script and bet-
ter soundtrack, makes “Django” one of the best 
films of the year.

On the surface, Benh Zeitlin’s debut “Beasts of the Southern 
Wild” may not seem much different from its competitors. Be it 
Tarantino’s spaghetti Western, Spielberg’s historical colossus or 
Hooper’s tragic musical drama — all of them engage in similar 
themes essential to humanity: struggle, isolation, loss, love and 
belief.

However, what makes this film stand out from the rest is its 
interesting style of narration, told through the eyes of 6-year-old 
Hushpuppy (Quvenzhane Wallis). The film tells the story of 
Hushpuppy’s fight for survival after an apocalyptic storm hits the 
isolated swampland that she and her ill father (Dwight Henry) 
live in. With her mother dead and her father’s health deteriorat-
ing, Hushpuppy is soon forced to take care of herself.   

In the course of the film, we see Hushpuppy grow into a self-
reliant girl whose courage, childish naivety, strong imagination 
and implacable zest for life help her to cope with the hopeless 
situation. Expressive, poetic imagery with elements of the fantas-
tic — beasts frozen in gigantic icebergs drifting slowly into the 
Arctic Ocean — emotionally loaded topics and Wallis’ incredibly 
authentic performance transform “Beasts” into an artful film that 
creeps under one’s skin immediately. 

Especially powerful are the scenes in which Hushpuppy 
transforms from a perspicacious young girl — there was “no 
time to sit around crying like a bunch of pussies” — into an 
anxious child hiding from fire inside a cardboard box: “When 
it all goes quiet behind my eyes, I see everything that made me 
flying around in invisible pieces. I see that I’m a little piece in a 
big, big universe.” 

“Beasts” is a small film among big, big ones — slightly pecu-
liar, with a strong emotional core and an inspiring perspective 
on life.  

Django  unchained

Sebastian Brady
EDITORIAL ASSISTANT

Michael Haneke has a way of implant-
ing a subtle idea — a creeping, haunt-
ing universal truth —  at the core of his 
films, and then allowing those notions 
to slowly unravel beneath our feet until 
we’re suddenly caught in a psychologi-
cal free-fall. In his fantastic horror film 
“Cache,” this notion was the past. In his 
Palme d’Or-winning “White Ribbon,” it 
was paranoia. The very title of Haneke’s 
latest film (which also took home the top 
prize at Cannes this year) seems to glee-
fully announce the Austrian auteur’s next 
field of study. But as it turns out, love is a 
complicated thing.

“Amour” centers on the least roman-
tic love triangle you’ve seen all year: 
an elderly couple (the excellent Jean-
Louis Trintignant and “Hiroshima, 
Mon Amour”’s Emmanuelle Riva) — 
one of whom is slowly succumbing to 
Alzheimer’s — and their daughter (played 
by a very raw Isabelle Huppert). Haneke’s 
unnervingly austere visual style and 
pacing remain, but the claustrophobic 
sets and committed central cast make 
the intricate cross section of tenderness, 
repulsion and nostalgia that much more 
immediate. “Amour” is cathartic, and at 
times even horrific, but its power lies in 
its unflinching commitment to unpacking 
love in all of its messy forms. 

No gay cowboys, no martial arts and no 
Jane Austen bonnets were needed to earn 
this Ang Lee-helmed film a Best Picture 
nod: just a boy, a boat and a computer-
generated tiger. Wooed by the allure of “Life 
of Pi”’s intense adventure and deep philoso-
phy, the Academy has given the movie 10 
other well-deserved nominations — only 
one behind leading contender “Lincoln.”

An adaptation of Yann Martel’s modern 
classic, the story follows the coming-of-age 
of an Indian child prodigy Pi, played by 
newcomer Suraj Sharma. By a stroke of bad 
luck, the film’s hero ends up on a nightmar-
ish Noah’s Ark-turned-animalistic “Hunger 
Games,” ultimately leaving Pi in the middle 
of the Pacific with the tiger. A strained 
alliance is formed between the fearsome 
feline and the resourceful teen, as both fight 
against the odds of nature and struggle to 
keep their will to live. At its core, the film 
could easily have become a droning adap-
tation of “The Old Man and the Sea,” but 
instead, it turns into a thrilling psychological 
journey. With its shockingly realistic CGI 
and Sharma’s authentic portrayal of the lead, 
the movie seems at times to be more of a 
documentary than an epic film, due in part 
to its consistently theological undercurrent 
that leaves the audience pondering God, 
religion and faith. Its thought-provoking and 
abstract complexity, stunning cinematogra-
phy, strong acting and beautifully rendered 
visual effects all make “Life of Pi” a film to 
watch out for on Oscar night.

You know Anne Hathaway is good when she’s on 
screen for less than 30 minutes of a two-and-a-half 
hour film and still lands a Best Supporting Actress 
nomination for her role in “Les Miserables,” Hathaway 
does a compelling adaptation of Fantine, a poor, strug-
gling mother who eventually turns to prostitution. Her 
bony figure adds to the mental depiction of her character’s 
struggle for survival, and her on-screen death leaves the 
audience shocked and silenced. Hathaway’s emotional per-
formance of “I Dreamed A Dream” was sung not only beau-
tifully, but also live during the shoot. She might as well start 
preparing her speech, as she’s already won a Golden Globe 
Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award and an award from the 
BAFTA for her excellent performance in the movie. Of course, 
she’s also the only nominee who bravely sacrificed her long locks 
for dramatic effect.

Alan Arkin

For a movie about the Iran hostage crisis, Ben Affleck’s “Argo” can be a 
surprisingly funny film. In between moments of intense drama, the film is 
balanced by these bits of levity. Alan Arkin composes most of “Argo”’s humor 
as fictional movie producer Lester Siegel. His humor is biting, almost bul-
lying; he’s the grandfather you wouldn’t wish on your worst enemy. Yet at 
the same time, he is one of the most complex and endearing characters in 
the film. Perhaps the best example of the kind of character gymnastics 
Arkin performs is a scene fairly early in the film, when Affleck’s charac-
ter pitches him the idea to sneak out the hostages through the cover of 
a movie production crew. Arkin’s character tells him how completely 
impossible it is, how ludicrous even suggesting it is — in moments, 
he shuts them down and gets up to leave. Then, he looks at the 
television, sees one of the hostages with his head covered by a bag, 
and tells Affleck that he’ll do it. From that moment on, we are 
firmly behind Arkin. He never fails to give us a laugh, and in a 
movie like “Argo,” that’s a herculean feat. Incredibly economical 
in his use of limited screen-time, with biting wit and a complex 
performance, “Argo” would be a far weaker film without him. 

This is the category to place bets on, 
because if there is one guaranteed win-
ner, it’s Daniel Day-Lewis’ performance in 
Steven Spielberg’s “Lincoln.” While watch-
ing the film is akin to watching the classic 
Disneyland animatronic stage show “Great 
Moments with Mr. Lincoln” —untouch-
able, reverent and life-affirming even as 
you catch yourself falling asleep — Day-
Lewis’ performance is on another level. The 
Lincoln we see in popular culture is all too 
often a caricature of strength (deep, rousing 
voice and all), but Day-Lewis took another 
approach. The subtle Lincoln in this film 
is not the one you’d expect; instead, we 
hear a quiet timbre to his voice that brings 
the president to life. Plus, if he wins, Day-
Lewis would become the first man to win 
three Academy Awards for Best Actor — a 
deserved feat, considering he is arguably the 
best actor alive.

The Academy has recognized a very diverse group of 
actresses vying for Oscar gold this year: Jessica Chastain’s 
portrayal of a tenacious Osama bin Laden-hungry CIA 
officer, Emmanuelle Riva’s take on a stroke-stricken wife, 
Quvenzhane Wallis’ interpretation of a young heroine 
named Hushpuppy and Naomi Watts’ poignant perfor-
mance as a tsunami survivor — but none deserve the 
highest honor like Jennifer Lawrence’s pointed blend of 
comedy and calamity as the erratic young widow Tiffany 
Maxwell in David O. Russell’s “Silver Linings Playbook.”

After her somewhat more somber roles in “The 
Hunger Games” and “Winter’s Bone,” (which also landed 
her a well-deserved Oscar nomination), Lawrence proves 
her cinematic versatility by showing that a character can 
be good-humored while simultaneously maintaining 
dramatic integrity. Lawrence’s performance is one of 
inner turmoil following the death of her husband and 
her subsequent sex addiction. She is crude, sexy, dirty, 
funny and vulnerable all at once. The unhinged and 
uncensored performance Lawrence delivers effectively 
blends the line of neurosis and humor. No best actress 
list is complete without the one woman who doesn’t take 
shit from anybody, even if it’s from the man she loves.

The winner of the Academy Award for Best Director has 
to do more than just make the best movie. Like a general in 
the army, the winner must be able to command a crew over 
the toughest of hurdles and make it out on the other side 
with a piece of cinema worth giving a damn about. If “Beasts 
of the Southern Wild” director Benh Zeitlin were an army 
general, he’d be the type fighting on the front lines with his 
fellow soldiers. Created as a collaborative effort with his 
startup film group Court 13 in the heart of New Orleans, 
Zeitlin orchestrated an entire battalion worth of artists and 
filmmakers in the Louisiana swamps. Steven Spielberg and 
Ang Lee, talented as they are, represent a more traditional 
form of directing, sitting in the director’s chair and sending 
lieutenants and officers to carry out the dirty work. “Beasts 
of the Southern Wild” is a unique beast indeed, built from 
the ground up to perfection. Each trailer home, makeshift 
raft, and gorgeous set dressing was handcrafted by Zeitlin 
and Court 13. Such devotion to craft can only come from 
someone new to the game who doesn’t care for the distinc-
tion between amateur and artist. “Beasts of the Southern 
Wild” proves that talent can come from the most extraordi-
nary of places, whether its source is a New Orleans pastry 
chef or a 7-year-old girl with an unpronounceable name.

After a promising start, with a preseason sweep against Western Oregon and a series 
win against Cal State San Bernardino, 
the Tritons dropped five of their six 
games last weekend at the NCFA 
Division II Leadoff Tournament in 
Tucson, Ariz.

UCSD has since dropped from the 
No. 2 spot, out of the NCAA Division-
II national rankings.

On Friday, Feb. 15, the Tritons fell 
to both No. 8 Augustana 4–11 and 
Southeastern Oklahoma State 1–2. 
UCSD picked up its only win of the 
tournament on Saturday against No. 6 
Minnesota State Mankato — a squad 
they faced at last season’s College 
World Series — after losing to 8–0 to 
Central Oklahoma.

The Tritons lost their last pair of 
games on Sunday, against unranked 
Missouri-St. Louis 1–11 and Regis 2–7.

UCSD returns to conference play 
this Friday through Saturday, Feb. 22 
and Feb. 23 at home, with a four-game 
series against Sonoma State.

GAME 1 — No. 8 Augustana 11, No. 
2 UCSD 4

Sophomore Taylor Sepulveda went 
3-for-4, with two runs scored, but the 
remainder of UCSD Head Coach Patti 
Gerckens’ squad clearly struggled at 
the plate. Big hitters, junior Caitlin 
Brown and senior Nicole Spangler 
both went 1-for-2, but failed to bring 
any one across the plate.

Gerckens went through three 
pitchers on Friday, sending sophomore 
Kayla Hensel to start. Hensel — last 
week’s CCAA Pitcher of the Week — 

had a tough 1.5 innings, giving up 
eight runs on just eight hits. Hensel was 
relieved by freshman Alexis Edwards, 
who was commissioned for the next 
three innings, allowing just two hits 
and keeping Augustana off the board. 

In her first game back from injury, 
senior Jennifer Manuel was brought 
in to finish, giving up three runs on 
four hits.

GAME 2 — Southeastern Oklahoma 
State 2, No. 2 UCSD 1

UCSD earned its only run of the 
game in the top of the seventh, as 
junior Dyanna Imoto doubled to left 
field to score freshman Amani Proctor. 
But the Tritons could not hold on to 
the advantage in the final frame of the 
game. Southeastern Oklahoma State 
came from behind in the bottom of 
the seventh inning to take the win. The 
Savage Storm laid down two squeeze 
bunts to go home with a tight 2–1 win.

Sophomore righthander Michelle 
Escamilla (1–3) went the distance in 
UCSD’s second game on Friday, giving 
up just four hits for two runs.

GAME 3 — No. 16 Central Oklahoma 
8, No. 2 UCSD 0

Central Oklahoma converted 
eight of its nine hits, while the Tritons 
stranded eight men on base in their 
8–0 loss.

Central Oklahoma went up 3–0 
in the first 0.2 innings, off a two run 
double from Nicole Workman and an 
RBI from Sam Cool. 

Gerckens pulled Escamillia before 
the first inning finished in favor of 
Edwards, who only pitched 3.1 innings, 

as the game ended early on account of 
the Mercy Rule.

GAME 4 — No. 2 UCSD 2, No. 6 
Minnesota State Mankato 1

A pair of Triton freshman car-
ried the UCSD offense to their first 
and only win of the tournament last 
Saturday.

Freshman Katie Saunders recorded 
her first career homerun to put UCSD 
up early, while freshman Callie Grant 
was brought home to score the game-
winner off a single from Spangler. 

Against the Mavericks, Hensel 
returned to form, going seven straight 
innings and giving up just three hits.

GAME 5 — Missouri-St. Louis 11, 
No. 2 UCSD 1

The Tritons committed eight errors, 
while only managing three hits in their 
11–1 defeat by Missouri-St. Louis. 

UMSL recorded only eight hits, but 
capitalized on UCSD’s untimely errors. 

Missouri-St. Louis picked up five 
runs in the first inning, and did not let 
off the gas throughout.

GAME 6 — Regis 7, No. 2 UCSD 2
The Tritons fell to the 1–10 Regis 

Rangers in their last game to close out 
the NCFA Tournament.

The Rangers went up 3–0 in the 
bottom of the second and sealed the 
win in the third inning off a grand

GAME   1    No. 18   UCSD   4,   CSU   Stanislaus   0 

Senior starter Ryan Goodbrand recorded a career-high 11 strikeouts against Stanislaus in 
seven innings. The two-time All West Region Pitcher allowed just three runs before he was 
relieved by freshman Troy Cruz in his last two innings.

UCSD went up 2-0 in the second inning as sophomore Brett Levy was batted in by fresh-
man Grandeigh Sanchez. Sanchez was advanced to second on a balk and scored on a hit by 
senior leadoff hitter Danny Susdorf.

Sanchez and Susdorf combined in the bottom of the seventh inning, when Sanchez was 
moved to third on a double from Susdorf. Sanchez scored off a single from junior transfer 
Jamie Moyer. The Warriors attempted to stop the bleeding, trading pitchers after the Tritons 
went up 3–0. But senior Justin Rahn immediately brought Susdorf home, bringing the score 
to 4–0.

GAME   2    CSU   Stanislaus   4,   No. 18   UCSD   3

The Warriors came from behind in the top of the 10th as Stanislaus’ Ross Gonsalvez bat-
ted in for two RBI as Stanislaus exhausted the Triton bullpen. UCSD managed to earn one 
run back in the bottom of the tenth, but it wasn’t enough to push an eleventh inning.

Rahn went 4.1 innings to start, allowing just one run. Junior Blake Fassler took to the 
mound for the next 2.2 innings and kept the board clean. Junior right-hander David Hart did 
not fare favorably, letting in three runs on two hits and taking the loss. Newman eventually 
pulled Hart in favor of senior southpaw Richard Kilbury. 

GAME   3   No.   18   UCSD   3,   CSU   Stanislaus   0

Senior Richard Siegel went 2–for–3, recording one double in the fourth inning and a 
homerun in the bottom of the sixth that put UCSD up 3–0. Junior Garrett Tuck and Cruz 
both had good games at the plate, going 1–for–2.

But in the second game on Saturday, surprisingly, the Tritons really won on the strength 
of their underclassmen pitching.

Sophomore Dan Kolodin went six innings, allowed just three hits and slated a career-high 
nine strikeouts. The sophomore, who has impressed early on, has a season ERA of just 1.2 
in his three games started this season, having pitched 15 innings second only to Goodbrand, 
who leads UCSD in innings pitched with 18.

Newman brought Kolodin off in the sixth in favor of sophomore Scott Zeman, who effec-
tively closed out the game for UCSD.

GAME   4    No.   18   UCSD   8,   CSU   Stanislaus   7

It took the bulk of the roster to come from behind and take the last game of the series on 
Sunday, as Newman deployed 12 batters and six pitchers against the Warriors.

True freshman Cruz recorded his first two-run homerun in the fourth inning to start dig-
ging the Tritons out of a 5–2 deficit. With two outs and redshirt freshman Corbin Wirta on 
third and Susdorf on second, Moyer singled to left field to bring both across.

Back at the top of the lineup in the bottom of the sixth inning, Susdorf and Moyer both 
recorded an RBI apiece to give the Tritons the 8–6 lead.

The No. 18 Tritons went 3–for–4 in their first CCAA series of the season against Cal State Stanislaus last weekend, Feb. 15–17. UCSD took the first game 
4–0 before dropping the second matchup 3–4 in extra 
innings. The Tritons shut out the Warriors on Saturday 
3–0 and capped the series with a tight 8–7 win on Sunday.

“I think I know that our bullpen’s starting to shore up 
again and that these guys have a will to win,” UCSD Head 
Coach Eric Newman said to the UCSD Athletics Department. 
“They will embrace adversity: This is the second time we’ve 
come from behind to get a win and we didn’t do a lot of 
that last year and it’s good to see us do that this year. So 
I’m pretty excited about how this team keeps coming.”

Newman explored the depth of his bullpen during the week-
end’s series, sending nine pitchers out to the mound and coming 
back with some interesting results. No surprise, Goodbrand 
was stellar in the series opener; the Triton ace picked up his 
second All-West region acknowledgement of the 2013 season 
through just three weeks of play. Sophomore Dan Kolodin had 
another solid start, going six innings in his third start of the 
season and recording nine strikeouts and allowing just three hits.  

At the plate, the Triton lineup has looked stronger and 
stronger with every subsequent game. Newman seems 
to have a winning formula with Moyer batting in the two-
spot and alternating between Spencer Frazier, Corbin 
Wirta, Brett Levy and Troy Cruz later in the lineup. 

The Tritons will look to protect their rank this weekend 
against CSU Dominguez Hills in a home-and-away series. UCSD 
will travel to Carson, Calif. to face the Toros on Thursday and 
Friday, Feb. 21–22 before returning home to close out the series.

“This week in practice and next week we need to take 
another step in how we play,” Newman said. “All the way 
around: offense, base-running, pitching, defense, even atten-
tion to detail stuff. We just need to continue to get better.”
