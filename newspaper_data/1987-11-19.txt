Cheryl Clearwater and Kerry Blart, above, were among the protes -
tors at the speech given by Nicaraguan Contra Leo Lacayo, left, 
last Tuesday night. 

Cont a speaks at UCSD 
By LETICIA VILLARREAL 
Stall Writer 

Leo Lacayo, freedom fighter to 
aome and Contra or cOWlterrevolu-
tionary to other., spoke Tuesday 
night at Revelle to a very intere.ted 
audience. 

Chris A1ario, UCSD alumni and 
member of the Y oUIII American. 
for Freedom (Y AF), aponaors of 
the event, introduced the 34-year-
old Lacayo 81 "the official repre-
sentative of the Nicaraguan re.ist-
ance here on the Welt Coa.t" and 
as an ex-Sandinista who ICopeqted 

a refugee camp under the Red 
Crosa during the anti-Somoza in-
surrection, taking care of 5,000 
refugees." 

When the Sandiniatas came to 
power, Lacayo worked as com-
munications director for the new 
,overnment'. campai,n atain.t 
.... cy. "Like moet Nicaraguans," 
Alario added, "he [Lacayo] was 
anti-Somoza" and a. a student and 
Catholic Church activist, took part 
in .it-in., strikes and demon.tra-
tiona against the Somoza regime. 

Alario stated that because of 
the. adiVitie. Lasvo "w .. jailed, 

beaten, and threatened on various 
occasions by Somoza's secret 
police." Lacayo claims he joined 
the Nicaraguan resistance because 
he "witnesaed increa .... violation. 
of human rights by the Sandini.ta. 
and the increa.ing repreuion 
atainat moderate. and critics of the 
regime, a. weU a. the total disre-
gard for the Nicaraguan people" by 
the "Soviet-backed regime," now 
"self-declared Marxists-Lenini.ts. " 

Lacayo argued in his presenta-
tion that there were m,awy more 
prominent ex-Somozistas in the

Committee approves sale 
of pound animals to UCSD 
By JANNY SCOTT 

The citizens' committee that ad-
vises the county on how best to deal 
with stray animals voted Nov. 4 to 
continue the controversial contract 
under which some county animals 
shelters sell dogs and cats to UC 
San Diego for research. 

The animal control Advisory 
Committee voted 5-2 with one 
abstention to continue the agree-
ment, which last year resulted in 
about 800 animals being sold to 
the university for use in such areas 
as heart and lung research. 

The commit&ee also opted to try 
to end the often emotional debate 
on the matter, choosing to take a 
final vote on the question rather 
than refer it to the county Board of 
Supervisors with a recommenda-
tion. 

"If people were compallionate 
and responsible, thi. wouldn't be a 
problem because the pound 
wouldn't have animals," contended 
Georjean Jensen, who made the 
motion to continue the contract. "I 
just think human life takes prece-
dence over dogs and cats." 

The committee's decision runs 

counter to recent trends in Califor-
nia, where ·animal advocates say 
nearly aU other ccklnties have ter-
minated the practice. In San Diego 
County, municipalities that handle 
their own animal control do not sell 
the animals for research. 

"I'm appalled that this commit-
tee. .. still is unable to make the 
distinction between the question of 
animals in research and the ques-
tion of what the source of those 
animal. should be," said Jane Cart-
mill of People for the Ethical Treat-
ment of Animals. 

Cartmill and other critics vowed 
to lobby the superviaor. to recon-
sider the issue. 

"This is a political issue, and 
we'll deal with it politically," said 
Mary Ann Melvin, director of a 
group caDed Stop Taking Our Pets. 

Under the current sy.tem UCSD 
may buy dogs and cats that are 
impounded by the county's Depart-
ment of Animal Control. The 
department's three shelters serve 
the unincorporated areas of the 
county and any cities that contract 
for animal control. 

Officials say that only animals 
without collars or identification may 
be sold for research. Animals are 

held for three working days , 
screened for adoption and, if found 
unsuitable, are held another three 
days before being offered to UCSD. 

Last year, 691 dogs and 129 
cats went to UCSD, selling for $55 
per dog and $25 per cat, plus tax. 

The department killed 25 ,115 
impounded and unclaimed animals 
by lethal injection. 

The Los Angeles County Board 
of Supervisors refused last year to 
order that county's shelter to stop 
selling animals for medical research. 
Only six of California's 58 counties 

. still allow the practice, animal con-
trol officials and advocate. say. 

On Wedneaday, comrniHee mem-
bers who favored continuing the 
contract expressed confidence that 
UCSD uses the animal. humanely 
and sparingly. They repeatedly 
pointed to the fact that the univer-
sity has a special committee that 
must review and approve aD animal 
research. 

They cited the university's argu-
ment that it would have to pay far 
more for animals if it were forced to 
buy them from special breeders, 
and they noted that twice as many 
animals would die under such a

UCSD hospital 
ranked among 

• • top SIX In state 
The UCSD Medical Center was named one of the six leading 

hospitals in California and one of the top 64 in the United States in 
"The Best Hospitals in America," a publication expected to become 
the classic consumer handbook in the medical field . 

Published by Henry Holt and Company, Inc. and co-authored by 
Linda Sunshine and John Wright of New York, the publication is the 
first comprehensive guide to the services and staff at this country's 
most outstanding medical facilities . . 

As noted by the authors, "With the 'detailed information provided 
in this book, progressive patients, either alone or with their physi-
cians, will be able to find the prime treatment centers for practically 
every serious illne .. and condition. The 64 inatitutions profiled in 
this book are those where many of the world's leading doctors and 
surleona practice, where exceDent nursing staHs are given a mean-
inlful role in their patient'. care and treatment, where state-of-the-
art medical technologiel are employed, and where, in almo.t every 
instance, the rn<»t prestigious research programs reaide." 

The author. added that where one is hospitalized, especiaUy 
when sur,ery i. involved, can be more important than the choice of 
doctor, and that the type of medical treatment received can dramat-
ically be determined by which facility is chosen. 

"[The admini.tration and .taff are] pleased and proud to be 
included in this elite group of oo.pitala," Pat JaCoby, director of

Sandinista government than in the 
resistance today . 

He described Vice President 
Ramirez Mercado as a man from 
"a prominent Somozista family" 
who had a\l of his studies "paid by 
Somoza directly" and was "the 
founder and publisher of the first 
pro·Somoza magazine" as well as 
"the leader 01 the Somozista 
youth" at his university. 

Lacayo also claims that Ramirez 
Mercado's subsequent occupations 
"prior to the revolution were in the 
Somoza government or through 
[its] sponsorship. 

He concluded by mentioning the 
Porvas family, who provided the 
Sandini.tas with airplan.:s and Uled 
to own the national airline in Nica· 
ragua under Somoza. Lacayo 
claimed that their power in Sandi· 
nista Nicaragua remains about the 
same as under Somoza's rule, and 
said that the Martinez Cuencas 
family, also pro·Somoza before, 
"runs finance for the Sandinistas." 

Lacayo's speech was frequently 

interrupted by a small, hostile 
group in the audience. One heckler, 
wearing a mask of Ronald Reagan, 
shouted at one point, "Hey, excuse 
me . When are we going to get to 
ask questions, huh?" He was told 
by Chris Alario that question.and. 
answer time would come after 
Lacayo's speech. The heckler kept 
interrupting with a similar request. 
He shouted once again, "Do we get 
to ask questions or don't we?" 

"You don't," Lacayo replied. 
"We don't?" asked the unidenti· 

fied heckler . 
"You don't." . 
"I don't!" the heckler exclaimed. 
"I don't talk to rude people, I'm 

sorry," responded Lacayo. 
"There will be a queltion and 

answer period after (Lacayo) fin· 
ishes his presentation," Alario 
repeated. 

"How much longer will he go on 
with these names," the heckler 
yelled, disregarding Alario. 

"This i. America . this is not 
Nicaragua," Lacayo responded. 

The heckler, an hispanic, ac-
cused Lacayo of "thinking in Eng. 
lish" and demanded that he talk to 
him in Spanish. Lacayo angrily 
proceeded to argue with the heckler

in Spanish, at one point suggesting 
he take a bath "for a change". 

Lacayo and the heckler calmed 
down soon, and Lacayo was able 
to finish his discourse, but not with· 
out further interruptions. As Lacayo 
was about to leave after the ques· 
tion and answer period, he was 
approached by UCSD student 
Arnie Schoenberg, who was seated 
in the front. Schoenberg was in the 
process of unzipping his pants in 
front of an American flag hanging 
from the chalkboard when Alario, 
other members of the Y AF, and the 
police officers present at the event 
jumped between him and Lacayo. 

The officers grabbed at his 
clenched fist, believing that he was 
carrying a weapon. Kristen Crab· 
tree , another UCSD student. who 
was ahlO seated in the front row, 
lunged aUhe officers and the Y AF 
members, shouting obscenities. She 
was subdued by a policewoman. 
What Lieutenant John J. Dyer 
later described as a "center punch" 
altered for use as a weapon by 
welded·on handles was found in 
Crabtree's lJOssession . Crabtree 
claimed that it was a keychain. No 
arrests were made. ~

Taking sides on a contraversial .issue 
By KRISTEN McCLEARY 
Feature. Editor 

Tuesday's lecture by Leo la-
cayo, the "Iicaraguan Contra 
member, proved to be a very good 
lesson in understanding the politics 
of war. Unfortunately , this wasn't a 
lesson which was learned from any-
thing Lacayo had to say, but rather 
by observation of the audience's 
reaction to Lacayo and to each 

some as freedom-fighters, and oth-
ers as rebels , who are trying to 
usurp the established Sandinista 
government in Nicaragua , the 
Contras are about as innocuous a 
political topic as Vietnam was . So 
the crowd of 40-50 people that 
attended the lecture consisted 
primarily of members from the two 
politi cal extremes and a few 
members who really wanted to 
listen to what Lacayo had to say. 

The left-wingers, right-wingers and 
moderates come to the same place, 
but each for a different reason. One 
to deny, one to affirm, one to question, 

other. One can understand why 
wars are so easy 10 start , yet so 
difficult to end_ 

The controversial appearance of 
a Contra isn't exactly going to 
attract a passive audience to a 
UCSD lecture hall . Deemed by 

But, for the most part , the audience 
seemed so full of their own opinions 
that the only time they actually 
heard Lacayo was when he said 
something that agreed with their 
own preconceived ideas. 

Controversy has a way of divid-

WESTERN 

ing people into well-defined groups. 
Hence, Tuesday's audience ca n be 
looked at as a sort of microcosm of 
the political divisions evident in 
countries who live in the highly 
charged climate of war. The left-
wingers , right-wingers and moder-
ates ('orne to the sa me place, but 
each for a very different reason . 
One to deny, one to affirm, one to 
Question. 

The actions of the different 
groups were apparent throughout 
Lacayo's talk . From the very 
beginning, a couple of heckling lef-
tists continually interrupted Lacayo 
by rattling papers, slamming doors, 
and verbally abusing him. Instead 

"of dealing with these harrassments 
in a rational manner, however , 
Lacayo jumped right into the same 
immature name-callinlZ _ He even 
went so far as to participate in a 
shouting match in which he and a 
student shouted at each other in 
Spanish; Lacayo telling the heckler 
to take a bath . The audience jumped 
into the fray as well by alternately 
applauding and booing the two 
contenders. 

With behavior like this it became 

clear tha t the only difference 
between the two extremes was a 
matter of appearance. If this is the 
type of action that takes place on a 
college campus with a supposed Iv 
educated audience, one can only 
imagine tha t reactions of the Nica-
raguan fighters in highly emotional 
and controversial situation. After 
a ll , most of their fighters are still 
teenagers and know more about 
the operation of rifles than they do 
about political ideologies. 

But the most disturbing event 
occurred at the lecture's close. A 
student attempted to expose him-
self and then approached Lacayo 
as if he was going to attack him. He 
was held off by police. This action 
resulted in a larger skirmish. After 
it was over, the police had confis-
cated a concealed weapon from 
one of the students (a modified 
" hole punch" with a sharp point at 
one end). 

Of course, not everyone took 
part in the violence and rudeness 
that permeated the lecture hall that 
evening. There were those who 
asked pertinent and intelligent 

questions. However , their voices 
were either lost in the crowd or 
Lacayo never got a chance to 
respond because he was too busy 
retaliating against the unending 
epithets which were continually 
thrown at him. 

So there you have it - a war in 
miniature . The two extreme politi-
cal groups end up resembling one 
another because they are both mot· 
iva ted by the same emotion - hate 
- and the moderates remain un-
heard . On a larger scale , the vio· 
lence and name-calling instigated 
by the extremist groups will con-
tinue to make headlines a nd the 
moderates will continue to think 
rationally - an act which unfortu-
nately doesn't make for a very 
exciting news story. Must the two 
extreme groups completely destroy 
one another before a modera te 
voice can be heard? If the behavior 
of Tuesday's audience is any indi-
cation, the answer would have to 
be "yes." But it is to be hoped that 
in war-stricken countries , the mod-
erates find a strong voice - one 
that drowns out the profanities 
uttered by extremists. ~

These children were from a new

school specializes in aeronautics

Why should children study math , 
science, and technology at (we 
hope) a high level of competence 
when their school is labeled with an 
appalling redundancy? 

Is CoP. Snow's horrid vision of 
two alien cultures in the same land, 
one humanistic and the other tech-
nological, happening in San Diego 
right now? 

Or am I overreacting to a lousy 
choice for a school name by some 
incompetent administrator? 

When astronaut Richard Covey

interesting and gladdening surprize 
was the number of schoolchildren

dozens of elementary schoolchild-

most refreshing.

SUZOlan 
Continued from page ·1 

The lecture was given before a 
packed house in the Mandell Weiss 
Center for the Performing Arts . 
Although the audience was mostly 
non.students, many students did 
attend. 

Laura Choe, a Warren College 
student, explained her interest in 
the lecture, " I wanted to raise my 
awareness of the situation 10 South 
Africa ... especially from someone 
who is in the system and actually 
working against it." Dr. Tony 
Ngubo, who teaches the class, 
" Social Change of Africa" at 
UCSD, called Suzman, "a dynamic 
speaker ... she has been fighti ng 
apartheid as long as I can re-
member." 

Suzman's description of South 
Africa included the state of emer· 
gency declared in July of 1985. 
Under this state, any person (adult 
or child) can be detained indefi· 
nitely without trial. Accordin,g to 
Suzman, an estimated 25;000 
people have been incarcerated since 
1985. "Now ," she says, "t~e statis· 
tics are a little better ... there are 
approximately 1 ,100 people reo 
tained without trial. about 100 of 
which are children under the age of 
18." 

Roberll..eone/ Gua,dian 

Helen Suzman is the longest serving member of the South African 
Parliament. 

The system of apartheid is a sys· 
tern based on racial difference. 
Suzman stated that discrimination 
is inevitable, because discrimina· 
tion is "legislatively entrenched in 
the South African government of 
the Group Areas Act. This act 
states that blacks, whites , and 
Asians, all have their specific areas 
to live on, and are confined to those 
specific areas. The blacks are then 
divided further into lO different 
areas, known as the Bantu home-
lands. The Group Areas Act is still 
in effect today. 

Suzman also described the go-
vernment's method of classifying a 
person's race. According to the 
1950 Registration Population Act, 
the government decides who a 
"white" person is by using the crite-
ria, "A white person is a person 
who in appearance obviously is a 
whit e perso n, and who is not 
genera lly accepted as a black 
person." 

Concerning the future of South 
Africa, Suzman said that, "there is 
no quick fix ... They [founders of 
apartheid) have created a Fran-
kenstein that they might not be able 
to deal with in the future." She said 
that since 1950, statutes have 
undermined the rule and legitimacy 
of law. Non-whites as well as whites 
fail to see the legitimacy of discrim-
inatory statutes, therefore losing 
respect for the authority behind the 
law. 

Suzman speculated that if the 
media was not state controlled , 
perhaps the people of South Africa 
would react differently, "Television 
viewers in the United States and the 
United Kingdom and elsewhere 
have seen over the last couple 
years . .. pictures of police violence 
in the townships and on the cam-
puses. We in South Africa have not 
seen those scenes." 

Pointing to the fact that televi. 
sion and radio are state owned and 
controlled, she said , "South Africa 
is able to show the public only what 
it wishes it to see .. . " 

One of the more controversial 
points in Suzman's lecture was her 
view on economic sanctions. She 
said confidently, " If I believed that 
the demise of the institution of apar-
theid would result from economic 
sanctions, I would back this course 
of action to the hilt ." Suzman, who 
has been a member of Parliament 

VCSD Department of Music 

for 34 years, added she probably 
has more experience with South 
Africa " than anyone sitting in this 
room." 

Based on her experience, she 
believes economic sanctions are 
ineffect ive. produce chaos, and 
increase poverty . According to 
Suzman, "Some believe a little suf· 
fering might not matter , but that's 
not the reality in a country where 
there is no social security net." 

She said that the voting white are 
not very hard hit by such sanctions, 
but rather it is the non-whites who 
feel the effect - "When you're out 
of a job, your kids are hungry, and 
there's no wcial security.. you 
care." 

In her lecture, Suzman presented 
many possible alternatives to eco-
nomic sanctions. She said foreign 
countries must continue stringent 
criticism of the oppression of South 
Africa. Another alternative would 
be an economic mode of change. 
According to Suzman, foreign bus-
inessmen should try to raise the 
social conscience of South African 
businessmen, which might, in turn, 
raise the social conscience of the 
voting South Africa as a whole. As 

to whom should remedy the situa-
tion, Suzman said , "The problem 
of South Africa should be solved by 
the people of South Africa - all 
the people of South Africa ." [Q)

Cheerleaders at UCSD 
have one guestion: 

'Where~s the spirit?' 
By REBECCA JAURIGUE 
Staff Writer 

Chanting, shimmying, posing - the cheerleaders of UCSD recently practiced their 
cheers and dances in a studio above 
the main gym floor . 

Cheerleaders at UCSD? Yes, 
you read right. 

Brigitte Blumer, a Muir College 
senior who heads the squad, claims 
that most students are unaware 
.that there are cheerleaders on 

campus. When student s do find 
out, reactions range from incredu· 
lous to dismissive. 

"People associate football with 
cheerleaders - and since a foot -
ball team is absent at UCSD, they 
don't see why cheerleaders should 
be here, " Blumer said. 

Blumer started the squad in the 
fall of 1986 when she transferred to 
UCSD from the Sacramento area . 
From her experience as a cheer· 
leader in junior hillh through junior

college, she felt that UCSD lacked 
the unified spirit that cheerleaders 
exemplify. 

"Any school that has an athletic 
program should have a support 
group. UCSD's tea ms do very well, 
and nobody seems to know that," 
she said. "I know some students 
who haven't attended a single ath· 
letic event in all the years they've 
been here." 

Although Blumer realizes that 
UCSD is also a diverse sports· 
oriented campus, she identified 
football and basketball as the two 
most popular university sports . 

"So I first approached Coach 
Marshall and the basketball team 
to see if they would even approve of 
a cheerleading squad - because if 
the coach and the team don't sup· 
port this, there's no reason for it." 

The basketball team has sup· 
ported the cheerleading squad from 
the start, according to Lori Eatmon 
the only returning cheerleader. 
"They invite us to the after.game 
parties and we have barbecues 
together," she said. 

Eatmon wants to help the new 
squad develop "a positive attitude 
about something that takes disci· 
pline." She shrugs off the indiffer-
ence from the rest of the campus . 
"We want to be accepted, not just 
have to draw on our own resources 
... but you get out of it what you 
put into it." 

So what does it take to be a 
cheerleader at UCSD? 

"Right now , because it's such a 
new organization and we're up 
against so much apathy, I look 

mainly for people with det~rmina. 
tion and enthusiasm. That will go 
over to the fans," Blumer said. 

The cheerleadering squad is listed 
with the A.S. as a student organi-
zation, yet Blumer feels that this is 
a mere formality . For instance, the 
squad has not received funding 
from the A.S . they need to defray 
transportation and uniform costs. 

The A.S. covers "operating ex· 
penses," such as paper for flyers or 
banners, according to Linda Stack, 
Student Affairs coordinator. "The 
cheerleaders have not received 
money because they have not asked 
for any," Stack said. 

Blumer responded , " That 's 
untrue. Every quarter I have asked 
for money. It's just that the A.S. 
does not fund the type of things we 
need funding for , so they tell me not 
to fill out the paper work {for a 
formal request) ." 

Blumer acknowledges the fact 
that the A.S. would have to restruc-
ture their financial policies before 
she will get any funding, something 
which she thinks needs to be done. 
"They need to support the students 
more. I go to the A.S. only when 
it's absolutely necessary," she said. 

As Blumer views it, the A.S. 
stance is representative of the rest 
of the university. "Other teams 
have never come to us with their 
game schedules .. . last year, the 
volleyball team went to division 
championships, and we could've 
been there. No one made the effort 
to contact us. " 

She continued, "It's hard enough 
to get eight girls together - who 
already practice three times a week, 
with one game a week - to go to 
other sports when the leaders don' t 
want us there." 

The cheerleading squad had been

set to perform at this Thursday' s 
"spirit night" in the main gym. 
Spirit night marks the first season 
game of the basketball team and all 
four of the colleges compete in the 
bandstands to see who has the 
most spirit (i.e., who can yell the 
loudest) . 

However, Blumer just discovered 
that there was no time set aside for 
the squad to do a routine during the 
half·time activities. " Bill Gannon , 
the sports information director who 
coordinated the event, has extended 
half-time by five minutes a lready,

UCSD extends to 
S.D. community 
By LAURA KNAPP 
Guardian Intern 

The extension program offered 
th rough UCSD is an educational 
opportunity for people from all over 
the San Diego community, inclu-
ding UC students, to expand their 
interests and "extend" their edu-
cation. 

This fall , UCSD Extension also 
established a program downtown, 
located on Cedar Street at the Cali-
fornia Western School of Law. 
UCSD rents rooms in this building 

every weekday evening for the 
mure than 30 classes that the new 
program offers. 

The idea for the downtown cen-
ter was formulated last winter and 
alter an impressive start the pro· 
gram has continued strong. Ac-
cording to Judy Parzen, director of 
Arts and Humanities at Extension, 
the new Extension Downtown has 
so far worked out "better than we 
imagined." She called the program 
"the branch of the university that 
reaches out to the community ."

Continued from page 7 

A benefit of having classes down· 
town is that it allows UCSD to take 
an active role in the educational 
growth of the San Diego commun· 
ity. The loca tion encourages many 
business people to take advantage 
of courses they may not otherwise 
take because 01 the convenient 
location. The classes start around 

six a t night a nd usuallv end by nine . 
The location also draws more peo· 
pie from the area of Chula Visl.'l 
and National City for whom its eas· 
ier to go downtown than all the way 
to the UCSD campus. 

P arzen said that the arts and 
humanities courses draw students 
from the greater San Diego area 
but that the business classes are 

mainly taken by people working 
downtown . She said the courses 
offer "a little bit from every depart. 
ment. There are a number of non· 
fiction writing classes. Languages 
classes are very strong, and there is 
a drawing class for fun ." Classes 
such as " Release the Writer Within 
You," "Beginning Conversational 
Spanish and French ," " Fundamen· 

tab of Drawing" and " Real Estate 
Property Management" are just" a 
few of the courses that were ollered 
this lall a t t he downtown center. 

Currently, most students at the 
Extension Downtown have been 
career people and members of the 
community. Although it is still more 
convenient for UCSD students to 
take courses on campus, taking 
classes downtown gives them the 
opportunity to meet people who 
work in professional fields . How-
ever, if UCSD students aren't able 

to go downtown they can still take 
advantage of the extension oppor· 
tunities ollered on the La Jolla 
campus. Extension gives UCSD 
students the opportunity to gain 
practical skills. 

Students may take advantage of 
Extension by enrolling in one free 
c1au per quarter , depending on the 
availability of class space and the 
amount of funds allotted to the pro· 
gram. This gives UCSD student. 
an opportunity to take c1anes not

offered through the regu lar cur· 
ri culum , or classes that are difficult 
to enroll in . 

All extension classes are taught 
by professional people currently 
working in the San Diego area. 
Cindy Murano, a member of the 
registration stall at Extension, feels 
this is a n important aspect of the 
Extention program. Since UCSD 
courses are mainly theoretical, 
having courses taught by working 
people gives students a more prac-
tical viewpoint. "Students really 
like it because they get a different 
perspective," she said. 

Parzen also stressed this as an 
asset because the people teaching 
know the local market which is 
something theory cannot teach . 
She feels it is beneficial for students 
to combine a theoretical course of 
study with Extension courses that 
help one gain practica l skills . This 
gives students a needed advantage 
when looking for a job. On the 
more practical side , however, Ex· 
tension does offer preparation cour· 
ses most quarters for GRE and 
LSAT tests .

let us cheer." According to Blumer, 
Gannon wasn 't even aware that 
UCSD had a cheerleading squad . 
She did say, however, that Gannon 
offered to work with the squad in 
the future. 

Despite these organizational dif· 
ficulties, Blumer has a positive out· 
look for the future of cheerleaders 
at UCSD - " It 's still only the 
beginning of the season." 

" I've been a cheerleader for 12 
years now - I do it because I enjoy 
cheerleading. The basketball team 
has been great, making the squad 
feel important ," Blumer said. "I've 
cheered at games where we had a 
low turnout, a nd so have the other 
girls. You get used to that. So 
you're not there so much for the 
crowd a nymore ... but for the 
team." [Q)

B-ball ready for opener 
Play La Verne for UCSD's annual Spirit Night 

By PHIL GRUEN 
Stall Writer 

With the UCSD men's basket-
ball opening game scheduled for 
tomorrow night against La Verne, 
six-year head coach Tom Marshall 
appears ready and anxious to bring 
his men onto the court. Having 
gone a lull year without facing La 
Verne, Marshall is unsure. how-
ever, which course the game will 
take_ Nevertheless, he is aware 01 
the basic elements generally asso-
ciated with openers - especially 
those that take place on Spirit 
Night. 

"Everybody's going to be real 
pumped up and ready to play," he 
said in a Wednesday interview. "I 
would expect a big crowd_" 

Coming off an 18-8 record and 
having lost four starters to gradua-
tion just a season ago, Marshall 
evidently had an immense task on 
his hands when the 1987-88 team 
began practicing. 

"Last year, we were a high scor-
ing team - we had three guys scor-
ing close to 20 points a game," he 
stated . "This year , with all the new 
players, we need to gel and come 
together with some cohesion. We 
are deep enough to be able to do 
that. " 

So deep, in fact, that Marshall 

mentioned that he would not even 
be surprised if he made mass sub-
stitutions during the course of the 
game - for instance, it might be a 
common occurrence to switch lour 
or even five players at a time. Lack-
ing the explosive scoring punch ot 
last year's group, the coaching stall 
has been stressing defense thus lar. 
Marshall pointed out that particu-
lar credit should be given to Mari.. 
Aumann, one of his three assistanl 
coaches, who, because of the large 
number of players, has converted 
into a defenSive coordinator of sorts 
(the lS-member roster is the larg-
est ever in UCSD history). 

In the initial basketball preview 
in the Monday , Nov . 9 issue of the 
Guardian, Marshall mentioned a 
temporary starting lineup - the 
one he used lor the preseason game 
against Grossmont Community 
College (a scrimmage which the 
Tritons dominated) - which even-
tually stuck and will be tomorrow's 
starting five : Tim Ra pp , Rob 
Rittgers. Andy Wagstaff, Kevin 
Stewart, and Andy Jedynak . Mar-
shall has decided upon a ligning his 
team in a 3-2 style, with three 
guards roaming the outside and 
two forwards inside converging the 
lane. Here is Marshall's basic eva-
luation of each judging from what 
he has seen thus far . 

Point guard (I-.pot): 
Rob Rittgers (6- 1 Jr. ) - Excel-

lent leadership qualities. Good 
combination of shooting ability, 
ball handling skills, and defensive 
ability. 

Dan Troy (6-0 Jr.) - Great def-
ensive talents. Could be our best 
defensive man on the team. Good 
footspeed . 

Greg Paskwietz (6-0 Fr.) -
Excellent outside shooter. especially 
three-pointers. Good ball handler. 
Shooting guard (2-.pot): 

Tim Rapp (6-4 Fr.) - Very 
good offensive player, but needs to 
work a bit on defensive skills. 

Bill Gerlach (6-3 Jr.) - Excep-
tional defense player. but needs to 
work a bit on defensive skills. 

Paul Keenan (6-5 Fr.) - Great 
jumping ability, very heady player. 
However, he has been out with a 
strained Achilles' tendon and will 
most likely just suit up for opening 
night. 
Shooting guard (3-.pot): 

Andy Wagstaff (6-7 So.) 
Handles the ball well, very good 
rebounding player from his position. 

[ric Quigley (6-5 Fr.) - Very 
aggressive player with the ability to 
make things happen. Started for 
Mater Dei High School last year, 
who eventually captured the Ca~­
lornia state title. 

Skip Dimuro (redshirt Fr.) -
Late addition to team. Shoots well 
and goell to boards well. Built like a 
basketball player. 
Power forward (4-.pot): 

Kevin Stewart (6-4 Sr.) - Te-
nacious ballplayer. Plays big inside 
for his size and boxes off under the 
boards. Relentless player who 
rebounds well. 

Robert Standifer (6-6 Jr.) -
Very strong player. Excellent out-
side shooting threat despite his 
position_ 

Kirk Kramer (6-6 Jr.) - Also 
very strong player with great leap-

ers. He a nd Standifer make up the 
strongest tandem on the team. 
Power forward (5-.pot): 

Andy Jedynak (6-10 Sr.) 
Very agressive and strong, yet 
plays a finesse-type game. Expect-
ing a good 10 points and 10 
rebounds Irom him per game. Team 
captain. 

Nick Capuano (6-7 So.) - Real 
strong player, crashes the boards 
and plays a muscle-type game. 
Provides nice contrast to Jedynak 
coming off the bench. 

Gordon McNeill (6-8 Fr.) _ 
Very good offensive player, but 
needs to work on strength. rn

has been filling your ear all game - It takes real 
guts, You also have to be in great shape, A 
referee is always hustling to be in the right 
positIOn to make thaI crucial call. A good ref 
will run several mites up and down the court 
every game, and often work three or four 
games in a row, 

A referee must also be dedicated The game 
of basketball IS governed by one of the most 
extensive sets of rules In sports. An offiCial 
must be able to recall and Interpret any rule In 
a split second. After the call. a referee must 
sland tough Ifl the faces of overwhelming odds

Travelin' blues 
by marci aronovin 

Simply mentioning the name of 
director John Hughes is bound to 
conjure up many familiar movie titles 
in the minds of today's cinema goers. 
Hughes has made quite an impact in 
the film industry of the '80s. Since 
his first screenplay, "National Lam-
poon's Vacation." he has written, as 
well as produced, at least one film for 
every year since. Some of those 
movies include' "Sixteen Candles," 
"The Breakfast Club," "Pretty in 
Pink," and "Ferris Bueller's Day 
Off." "Planes, Trains a'nd Automo-
biles," Hughes' most recent movie, 
will be previewed at Mandeville 
Auditorium on Monday, Nov. 23. 

Though' most of his films have 
dealt primarily with teenagers, 
Hughes said during a recent inter-
view in L.A., he does not intend to 
restrict himself solely to that age 
bracket nor did he intentionally 
create such a pattern. The popularity 
of his films can be attributed to their 
light hearted subject matter which 
most people usually find some aspect 
of their own lives in. 

Hughes' moviesaccomodatea wide 
range of viewers because his subject 
matter is light, yet often touches on 
sensitive issues which adults and 
teens can both relate to . When asked 
if this combination of humor and 
realism, his trademark, was hard to 
achieve, he simply stated modestly 
that the success of his films was large-
ly due to the actors who bring life to 
his work. 

Hughes' latest film, "Planes, 
Trains, and Automobiles" does in 
fact stray away from the sort of "brat 
pack generation," with John Candy 
and Steve Martin as the stars. The 
film is about the hassle of holiday 

' travel and more specifically, two 
men of a different breed 'and their 
adventures on planes, trains, auto-
mobiles and other mode of trans-
port . 

Neal Page (Steve Martin) is an 

advertising executive making his way 
home to spend Thanksgiving with 
his family. Del Griffith Oohn Candy), 
a shower curtain ring salesman, 
expends his advke to Page when they 
are way-laid on their flight from New 
York to Chicago. Griffith's advice 
and suggestions cast the two men 
into one catastrophy after another as 
the two men try to make it to their 
respective homes. 

The movie is not particularly 
complex, but the conflict of situa-
tions gives the movie its humor, and 
a drama as well. Through treachery 
and Page's disdain for Griffith, the 
two men form a friendship which 
adds a warmth to the movie making 
appropriate for holiday cheer and 
laughs. The movie is scheduled for 
release on November 25. 

At a recent press conference with 
Hughes, Candy and Martin, the feel-
ing amongst reporters and the men 
themselves was very positive. In 
keeping with the theme of the movie, 
Candy arrived late due to a delayed 
flight allowing Martin a few humor-
ous cracks before things got under 
way. In revealing each of their worst 
travel nightmares, Hughes said that 
has prompted him to do the script. 
He was actually rerouted on a flight 
from New York to Chicago ending 
up in Kansas and not returning to his 
original destination until five days 
later. 

When asked how Hughes chose 
Candy and Martin for the movie he 
replied jokingly, "they were forced 
on me, and the price was right." On a 
more serious note he admitted that 
he'd been watching both men for 
awhile and he simply liked their 
work. In response to another ques-
tion, Hughes also discussed the dif-
ference in working with the older 
generation. He said that most of the 
set time was spent working to~ether 
because of their similar experiences. 

Hughes seemed to feel that Martin 
and Candy were an attribute as far as

A 'date' to miss 
by kristen mccleary 

features editor 

Film audiences have long been 
enthralled with the subject of heaven. 
Think back to' the original " Heaven 
Can Wait" and Frank Capra's "It's 
A Wonderful Life." This fall ushers 
in a new group of films devoted to 
the rea lm of heaven. " Hello, Again," 
"Made in Heaven" and beginning 
this Friday, "Date with an Angel" 
will be vying for a corner of the spir-
itual film market. A record breaking 
143 movies will be competing for the 
Christmas audience and "Date with 
an Angel" - the film most intent on 
recapturing the nostalgic innocence 
of a Frank Capra past - can't exactly 
boast an original theme. 

In an interview conducted last 
week , the film's director/ screen-
writer, Tom McLoughlin, and lead-
ing actor, Michael Knight, spoke 
enthusiastically about their film's 
chance for success in such a flooded 
market. "It was purely coincidence 
that these films all ame out at the 
same time," McLoughlin said. 'Made 
in Heaven' was filmed a year ago and 
I wrote a screenplay for 'Date' 7 
years ago." 

McLoughin sees his films as being 
unique from the others because it is 
both a comedy and light romance. 
'Made in Heaven' is surreal and even 
a dark film," he said." 'Hello 
Again' is strictly comedy - no 
romance." 

McLoughlin's background does 
not exactly foreshadow his move 
into romantic comedy. Although 
given an Emmy nomination for his 
writing in the Dick Van Dyke Show, 
Mcloughlin is better known for 
starting the LA Mime Company (he 
studied in Paris under Marcel Mar-
ceu) and directing "Friday the 
13th-Part-VI-Jason Lives." 

Actor Michael Knight as well has 
done a swift turnabout for his role as 
Jim Sanders, the young man who 
falls for the angel that fell in his pool. 
Best known as the debonair yet devil-

ish Tad Martin on the soap "All My 
Children" Knight turns in his horns 
for a halo in "Date." Patterned after 
a James Stewart character (Jim San-
ders/ Jimmy Stewart, get it?), Knight 
plays the boy next door who must 
protect his angel from earthly harm. 
He also has to convince his fian~ee, 
Pattycat, that he 's not sleeping with 
the heavenly help. 

Knight makes the transltlon sur-
prisingly well from small screen to 
big screen and from bad guy to good 
guy . "Soap Opera's are very syste-
matic," he said . "You have to sustain 
a character for a long time. I got to 
know Tad Martin very well. In soaps 
you rely heavily on yourself and fel-
low actors but in films you rely on 
your director ." 

By watching McLoughlin and 
Knight talk to each other it was 
obvious that they were well-versed 
in the benefits of the buddy system. 
Knight continually complimented 
McLoughlin o n his "well written 
script." Knight commented, "I'm a 
fanatic for good writing. A movie is 
only going to be as good as its 
script. " 

Touche. "Date with an Angel" is 
only as good as its script - and that's 
not very. 

·" E.T." and "Splash" had similar 
themes where other-world creatures 
become initiated to the novelties of 
this world. "Date" is those movies 
all over again. Only the angel's ver-
sion of phoning home, is to dial 
direct - she communes with God by 
giving him a private concert in the 
woods at night. Her accompaniment 
is a divinely inspired light show. (No 
Madonna, God doesn't hire out.) 

Emmanuele Beart as the Angel 
looks a bit too much like Darryl 
Hannah's Madison in "Splash." Both 
have the same long blonde hair on 
the verge of becoming dred locks and 
the same wide innocent gaze. The 
angel even steals a scene from Madi-
son. (Wait - an~els don't steal.

In "Hope and Glory" (now 
playing at the Cove), director 
John Boorman alternates be-
tween the funny and the touch-
ing, and succeeds in creating a 
thoroughly entertaining 
movie. 

Set mainly in London during 
World War II, the movie tells 
the story of the Rohan family 
through the eyes of seven-year 
old Bill (Sebastian Rice Ed-
wards). Boorman (who also 
directed "Deliverance" and 
"The Emerald Forest") treats 
the war in much the same way 
that Bill sees it, usually ex-
citing and occasionally as a 
nuisance, but only very rarely 
threatening. 

There is something comic 
in watching Bill complain to 
his mother (Sarah Miles) that 
the real war isn't as interesting 
as the battles they have in the 
movies, or being taken pri-
soner by a gang of other seven-
year otds. To the children, the 
war means the'f\ can play in the 
rubble of destroyed buildings 
and, most importantly, that 
school is often disrupted. Bill 
and his classmates treat the air 
raid siren the same way they 
treat the recess bell - as an 
excuse to run, smiling and 
shouting, from their class-
rooms. 

The rest of Bill's family takes 
the war more seriously. His 
aging father, Clive (David 
Hayman), volunteers immedi-
ately to fight the Germans, 
only to be assigned a position 
as a clerk. Bill's mother is left 
to deal with her children and 
difficulties alone. 

At times it seems that they 
take the war almost too ser-
iously:.There is the time when

Clive, home on leave, brings 
back a can of German jam 
which washed up on shore. 
Despite the fact that the 
Rohans have been short of 
jam since the war began, Bill's 
mother tells an incredulous 
Clive that she won't taste any . 
The Germans could be poi-
soning jam and planting it on 
the shore, she says, and they 
could kill half of England that 
way. 

The most enjoyable mo-
ments of the film concern Bill's 
unsupervised adventures, 
either in the ruins of London 
or at the country home of his 
grumbling, cantankerous grand-
father George (played by 
former Oscar nominee Ian 
Bannen). He and his friends 
have the time of their lives 
smashing up whatever they 
find in the abandoned, bomb-
ed-out houses. The only time 
they actually see a German is 
when a pilot bails out of his 
plane and lands among the 

. ruins of Bill's neighborhood. 
Bill's older sister (Sammi 

Davis) also gives her mother 
plenty of problems. Between 
trying to sleep through the air 
raids and sneaking out late at 
night to meet her Canadian 
boyfriend, she often worries 
her mother more than the 
Germans do. 

lt there is a problem with 
the movie, it lies mostly in the 
second half, where the focus 
gradually shifts to older 
people. Although the charac-
ters are still interesting, the 
story drags at points, especially 
compared to the first half. 
Since most scenes are episodes 
which are connected to the 
rest of the movie but succeed 
or fail on their own merits, 
one can't escape feeling that 
the few slow scenes could be 
shortened or cut without da-
maging the rest of the film. 

At times, the movie seems 
to be supporting the claim of 
one of its own characters, that

When the curtains draw and 
"Nuts" begins, the first 
thought that comes to mind is, 
"Oh no, not another court-
room drama!" Granted that 
most of this film does take 
place in the courtroom, there 
is one outstanding feature that 
separates "Nuts" from other 
films of this genre, Barbra 
Streisand. 

"Nuts," which is based on 
the play by Tom Topor, is 
about a woman, Claudia 
Draper (played by Steisand), 
and her attempt to prove her 
sanity. The story finds Draper 
about to be convicted guilty of 
murder and sentenced to a 
mental institution due to a 
plea of insanity from her own 
defense. Convinced that she is 
in fact sane and worthy to 
stand · trial, she physically re-
moves her lawyer and demands 
that she be heard. 

At this point, a reluctant 
public defender, Aaron Levin-
sky (Richard Dreyfuss) is ap-
pointed to her and is expected 
to also proclaim her insane. 

Rather than make a plea on 
behalf of a client he has yet to 
meet, Levinsky decides to re-
search the case instead. The 
relationship that ensues is both 
hostile and moving, and leads 
to some humorous and touch-
ing scenes. 

The courtroom drama that 
follows involves , her parents' 
(Maureen Stapleton and Karl 
Malden) claim that she is not 
mentally capable to stand trial 
along with a similar opinion 
from the prison psychiatrist 
(Eli Wallach). Tempers flare 
and sparks fly when Claudia 
refuses to remain dormant 
during the proceedings. A-
midst what she feels are count-
less lies and inaccuracies, 
Claudia cries for justice in a 
most contemptuous manner. 

Levinsky's revealing presen-
tation on behalf of Claudia, as 
well as her own added com-
mentaries, helps bring the sit-
uation to light. However, when 
the final decision is left up to 
the judge (James Whitmore) 
neither prosecution nor defen-
dent are assured victory. 

To say the film belongs en-
tirely to Streisand would not 

do justice to the remarkable 
performances of the other 
actors in "Nuts." Dreyfuss 
does an excellent job portray-
ing her attorney as well as her 
only friend. The vivacity and 
stamina that he expresses in 
several of the intense court-
room scenes surpise the au-
dience who normally see him 
as a more subdued character. 

Also deserving of attention 
is Wallach's portrayal of Dr. 
Herbert A. Morrison, the 
county prison's resident psy-
chiatrist. His excellent rendi-
tion of a cold and narrow-
minded psychiatrist evokes a 
deep mistrust and hatred for 
his character from the viewer. 

But deserving of most of the 
credit is, of course, Streisand. 
In addition to an outstanding 
performance, she is also the 
film's producer and musical 
composer. Streisand brings to 
her role as Claudia Draper a 
feeling of trust and support 
from the audience, almost ap-
pearing as if the role was tailor 
made for her. 

"Nuts" is definitely a high-
point in Streisand's pheno-
menal career and will no doubt 
bring her praise and respect. It 
is a movie about pride and 
determination, and with 
"Nuts," Streisand has reason 
to be proud.

an Arnold Schwarzenegger 
movie - thriHs, chills, and 
cliches. Yes, good old Arnie is 
taking on the world again. Yet, 
for a movie of its genre, this 
one isn't half bad. Written by 
Richard Bachman, alias Ste-
phen King, it is set in the year 
2017 in a futuristic totalitarian 
world containing aspects much 
like the world in George Or-
well's 1984. 

The actual social implica-
tions of this movie, as you'd 
expect, cannot be compared 
to 1984. The Orwellian setting 
is used merely as a tool so that 
Schwarzenegger can set the 

world right again . 
The brainwashed citizens of 

this futuristic world have one 
thing in common - they get 
their kicks by zealously wat-
ching a TV game show hosted, 
by none other than Richard 
Dawson. In this game show, 
so called criminals are hunted 
down by brutal stalkers, much 
to the audience and TV-view-
er's delight. Dawson plays his 
part as game show host very 
well, with egotism and humor. 
In the movie, however, Daw-
son's character, Damon Kil-
lian, makes a big mistake by 
electing Schwartzenegger's 
character, Ben Richards, to 
play the game of death . 

Schwarzenegger's perfor-
mance is as good as can be

The exhibit chronicles the e-
volution of American life from 
the horse-drawn carriage to 
the development of the car, 
train and airplane. 

For those really interested 
in history, the exhibit offers 
the blue "Lindy," a replica of 
The Spirit of St. Louis that 
Lindbergh used in his historic 
trans-Atlantic solo flight . Also

Other highlights include a 
red pedal car driven by two 
teddy bears and a huge out-
door freight train probably 
used to cart small children 
around. 

Much of what is unique 
about these toys is their dura-
bility and attention to detail. 
For example, include in the 
exhibit is a child's formal tea 
set that contains miniature 
china plates, goblets, even 
linen napkins inside a small 
picnic basket. This set has 
been around since 1900! 

All the toys on exhibit orig-
inate from a collection that 
has over 5,000 pieces. The 
exhibit permanently resides in 
the Detroit Antique Toy Mu-
seum. Lawrence Scripps Wil-
kinson, a member of the fam-
ily which participated in 
founding the Scripp's Institu-
tion of Oceanography, as-
sembled the toy collection 
over a period of 30 years. 

For those interested, the 
exhibit runs from Nov. 7 to 
Dec. 13. 

Hope 
Continued from pale 2 
"growing up is no fun at all." 
It is when the children are 
around that "Hope and Glory" 
is truly captivating. 

John Boorman drew on the 
memories of his own child-
hood to direct the film, which 
he also produced (with Mi-
chael Dryhurst) and wrote. 
He convincingly recreates the 
1940s, and is aided by a cast of 
first-rate actors and actresses. 
all of whom give excellent 
performances. "Hope and 
Glory" easily overcomes its 
slow moments to become a 
movie well worth seeing. 

The Cove Theater is located 
at 7730 Girard Avenue. For

Into the Grove 
by sabrina youmans 

Under the eucalyptus tress, 
and surrounded by lush ferns 
and lillies, seductively reclines 
"Delores" examining her fin-
gernails. The over ZOO-pound 
solid body terra cotta figure 
by T.] . Dixon is the siren piece 
of the UCSD Crafts Center 
Faculty Plus Show now being 
exhibited at the Grove Gallery. 

Eighteen of the center's fac-
ulty members and their guests 
contributed to this diverse ex-
hibit, in which all manner of 
art and crafts are shown: 
photography, basketry, hand-
blown glass, sand-blasted glass, 
metal works, clay, fiber, and 
paper. The faculty show has 
been a Grove Gallery annual 
event since 1983. The 'Plus' 
represents an enlargement of 
the scope of the show - a 

scope that allows faculty mem-
bers to invite guests to exhibit. 

The Grove exhibit is visually 
complex due to the diversity 
of competing images. The 
works provide a window to 
the Crafts Center's pro~ram . 
Ron Carlson, the director of 
the Crafts Center, and studio 
staff are energetic and full of 
ideas to further the quality of 
the Crafts Center program. -

According to Carlson, the 
Crafts Center goals are to offer 
skills without academic pres-
sure, university politics, or 
any specific function other 
than to cjffer a casual social 
atmosphere. The array of 
media and the different styles 
of artists are incomparable. 
Jay Whaley's untitled paper, 
wood, and red hemp is an 
interesting piece which Ron 
Carlson describes as, "Striking 

Three porcelain vases by Lana Wilson.

contradiction. It looks tough 
but it is made out of wood,

like a button." 

Also intriguing are the glass 
works by Buzz Blodett and his 
associate Jeff Seely, both of 
whom teach glass-blowing at 
the Crafts Center. "Under 
Duress," by Leslie Nemour, is 
reflective of social appearance

gant textures and nuances of 
marble coloration. 

Displayed in the center of 
the Gallery, are incredible pot-
tery works. Carlson's unique 
teapot is juxtaposed to Kathy 
Gruzda's two staggered teapots 
and stands. The Crafts 'Cen-
ter's studio manager, Kathleen 
Corther, introduced two fem-
inine Raku torsos. These tor-
sos and guest artist Bill Weis-

colored in metallic opaque

used the Raku technique on 
his powerful "Tor" seris. His

A big Zero 
by lara mihata 
hiatul ttaff writer 

You would think that with 
Andrew McCarthy, Robert 
Downey, Jr. and Jami Gertz, 
" Less Than Zero" would at 
least be semi-entertaining. It 
doesn't even come close. Based 
on Bret Easton Ellis ' auto-
biographical novel of the same 
name, "Less Than Zero" is 
not even slightly believable. 

In the novel, the characters 
are depicted as having a lot of 
money at their disposal, but to 
bring this into the movie was a 
mistake. These people are rich, 
and depicted as so rich in the 
movie that it ruins its credi-
bility. The downfall begins in 
the opening flashback to high 
school graduation. Everyone 
has a bottle of Dam Perignon. 

When the movie begins, 
Clay Easton (Played by Mc-
Carthy) returns to his home in 
Beverly Hills after being away 
at school for six months . It is 
obvious that life in the East 
has changed and matured him 
when we see him reunited 
with his two closest friends 
from high school- Julian and 
Blair. These friends haven't 
progressed or done anything 
productive since graduation. 

Julian (played by Downey) 
has been through hell - he 
has accumulated a $50,000 
debt to his drug dealer friend 
Rip (James Spader). Julian 
keeps promising to come up 
with the money, fails, and 
repeatedly (at the request of 
Rip) must turn to prostitution 
in order to survive. At the 
same time, Julian continues to 

free-base whenever he has the 
chance. Downey's and 
Spader's performances are the 
only redeeming qualities of 
the film . 

Meanwhile, Clay doesn't 
seem to mind that he's come 
back to find that his girlfriend, 
has also formed a drug ad-
diction. He still loves her, even 
though it seems apparent that 
she has undergone quite a 
transformation . She has ob-
viously sniffed a few too many 
lines of cocaine. McCarthy is 
handicapped due to the fact 
that his character doesn't allow 
hi m to develop. His acting has 
definitely been better. 

Blair's character never really 
develops into anything either. 
She sort of watches everything 
happen, but she is not alert 
enough to help. 

The movie promotes drug 
awareness. Clay doesn't do 
drugs (at least not anymore), 
but it seems like everyone he 

}ami Gem, Robert Downey, Jr. and Andrew McCarthy. 

knows in Los Angeles does. 
"Less Than Zero" serves to 
show what can happen. The 
level on which this is done is 
unrealistic, but the same gener-
al message comes through. 

What ruined the film was 
that it was so difficult for 
almost anyone to relate to. 

What happened to Julian could 
happen to the average kid out 
of high school, but on a much 
smaller scale. The wealth in-
volved was purely ridiculous. 

Don't waste your money on 
this flick.. No matter what the 
cost, you won't get your 
money's worth.

"Standing in Between" isan art presentation by Wen-vi 
Hou showing this week at the Mandeville Annex gallery 
from noon to 5 pm until Nov. 20. 

Hou will be shOWing two types of her work: one is "very 
Chinese" and the other is similar to Western inter-
pretation. Hou explained that the unidentical appearance 
was her attempt at sharing the vexation, confusion, and 
excitement which she has felt here since facing the two 
different cultural backgrounds. 

"This show, in a way, is a conversation between what I 
am learning from them. It may give you a feel ing for how I 
interpret Eastern and W este rn culture, tradition, and my 
postion inside."

Maybe she just borrows

to apply her underwater 
eating techniques to the 
body of a..Jobster in the 
middle of a posh New

angel substitutes cold

Wendy's replaces the posh

however, is that seart can

nominated for a cesar (the

Phoebe Cates puts in an 
inexcusably wretched per-
formance in this role . 

McLoughlin 'S script has

an affinity for idealistic in-

he has more than a few one-

paning him. 

"Running Man" is a fairly
