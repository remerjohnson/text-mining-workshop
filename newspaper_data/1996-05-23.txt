UCB Faculty Buy 
Ad In New ......... 
BERKELEY, Calif. - Nearly 
150 UC BeJteley faculty 
members paid a total of 53,500 
for a full-page advertisement in 
the New York Times' national 
edition. The ad called upon the 
UC Board of Regents to wait 
until after the November 
elections to implement last 
summer's SP-I and SP-2 
proposals, which would 
eliminate the university's race-
based admissions, hiring and 
contracting policies. The faculty 
members said they hoped the ad 
would draw public attention to 
the internal strife plaguing the 
University of California since 
last summer's vote to end 
affinnative-action policie .

CONGRATULATIONS Buchanan 
Abruptly Pulls 
Plug on RIMAe 
Dinner Event 
CANCELLAnON:Some 
speculate politician backed out 
after unwanted publicity 
By Terry Lew 
Associate News Editor 

Presidential candidate Pat Buchanan abruptly 
canceled Tuesday a party his office had sched-
uled in UCSD's RIMAC Arena for Aug. 10, 
after word of the event surfaced early this week 
in the San Diego Union-Tribune. 

Buchanan assistant Connie Mackey origi-
nally told the Union-Tribulle the p~rty was to be 
for 2,500 supporters of the con ervative presi-
dential candidate, saying the event was "a chance 
for everyone who's worked hard on the cam-
paign over the year to have fun." 

Mackey said the event was to feature "live 
bands and a big 01' barbecue," as well as a video 
showcasing the Buchanan campaign. RlMAC 
Production Manager Steve Evans said UCSD 
administrators had very little knowledge of the 
Buchanan campaign's plans for the space. 

"We don't really know anything about it 
except that they were going to show that video," 
Evans said. ''To my knowledge, that was what 
the meeting was based around. I heard the bar-
becue was canceled, and I heard it was just 
going to be an evening indoors." 

"It was going to be a reception for his support-
ers - by invitation only," UCSD Sports Facilities 
Director Don Chadwick said. "My understanding 
was that there was going to be a casual dinner, and 
they were going to unveil the video." 

Mackey, whom Chadwick said wa UCSD's 
contact in the Buchanan camp, refused to di -
cuss the event or its sudden cancellation. 

"We're in a 'no comment' mode right now," 
she said. 

The normal charge for an off-campus group 
to use the RIMAC Arena is $4,250. Chadwick 
said Buchanan's staff stopped payment on Tues-
day for the campaign 's 30-percent-deposit check. 

The university has no recourse against 
Buchanan because plans for the event had not 
yet been finalized. 

"We didn 't actually have a signed contract," 
Chadwick said.

Doppelt before his "Ethics and Society" class. Doppelt, Mathematics Professor Peter Doyle,

Although a UCSD Communications release 
stated Buchanan IS arranging for an alternate

have much success.

UCSD Student-Employees Union Votes to Strike in Fall Quarter 
UNION: Details of 
strike to ~ decided in 
Fall Quarter vote 
By M ..... ne VIII. 
Senior Staff Writer 

In another attempt to pre sure 
the administration into granting 
union rights such as collective bar-
gaining, UCSD' s Association of Stu-
dent employees (ASE) voted Tues-
day to strike in the fall. 

Ninety-six percent of the more 

than 100 student employees who 
voted indicated that they were pre-
pared to strike if the university con-
tinued to refuse recognition of their 
union. 

"We just want to show [the uni-
versity) that we are dead serious 
about having a voice in our work-
place issues," ASEJUnited Auto 
Workers (UA W) spokesperson Kate 
Bums said. 

ASE partnered with the UAW 
for financiaJ and organizational sup-
port. 

" 

Details of the scope and duration 
of the strike will be decided in another 
vote to be held in the fall. In the 
meantime, the union will form a com-
mittee to discuss various options and 
to coordinate with other UC employ-
ees who are planning to strike. 

The current strike vote comes on 
the heels of an ASFJUA W two-day 
walkout last spring, which Bums 
said was meant to both show the 
group's solidarity and convince the 
administration to grant it recogni-
tion. The fall strike could take the 

fonn of a limited walkout or an 
ongoing strike. 

Bums said student employees need 
a union to protect their interests in the 
workplace, especially in the face of 
budget cuts and increased class sizes. 

"[The university) continues to 
tell us, 'We know what' be t for 
you,' but they don't," she said. 

According to Bum , the main 
issues on which the union will fo-
cus, if recognized, will be workloads 
and health-care benefil$. Student

During World War II, the area was 
used as a lookout spot and training

existing reserve in 1981. 

Currently, the knoll is home to 
some 190 species of flora, as well 

as an array of rare

W~ the bluff was first ac-
quired by the uni versity during the 
early I 980s, the mesa top was 
granted temporary reserve status, 
which lasts for a period of20 years. 
During that time, the university 
hoped to determine whether the 
area could serve as a viable teach-
ing-and-research venue. In four 
years, the knoll wi II be considered 
for permanent reserve status. 

While SIO has been respon-
sible for the shoreline west of the 
institution since 1929, it wasn't 
until 1981 that Black's Canyon, 
the knoll and the steep bluffs rising 
from the beach became incorpo-

reintroduce native plant life, said 
that the reserve represents a valu-

munity. 

"People kind of take it for 
granted, but if it's not a productive 
research site, the UC system might 
decide that it would be better off 
selling it," Van Hoorn said. "People 
should know that it might not al-
ways be there."

California. Review Debate Resolved 
AGREEMENT: A,S. 
hopes to avoid future 
misunderstandings 
ByuuraUmb 
Staff Writer 

Members of the California Re-
view - UCSD's conservative pub-
lication - responded at last night's 
A.S. meeting to councilmembers' 
concerns about a controversial ad-
vertisement in the most recent issue 
of the magazine. 

Last week's counci I meeting was 
marked by controversy in regards to 
the ad, which was tabbed by several 
council members as potentially rac-
ist or "oppressive." 

At last night's meeling, Califor-
nia Review Editor in Chief Kerry 
Liu said she disagreed with the 
council's treatment of the issue and 
felt thai councilmembers' statements 
in the Guardian were "personally 
very insulting [and] more demean-
ing than anything I've had to en-
dure." 

A.S. President Coleen Sabatini 
said she understood Liu' s position. 

Sabatini said that the council's rea-
son for discussion with representa-
tives of the California Review rep-
resentatives was to make editors of 
the magazine aware of certain stu-
dent reactions to the advertisement. 

Sabatini said the council wanted 
to voice student concerns. "We're 
not asking for an apology .... We just 
wanted you to be aware that (some) 
people are interpreting (the adver-
tisement) a certain way," she said. 

Vice President External Affairs 
Alex Tom, who initially made cop-
ies of the ad and distributed them to 
councihnembers, agreed with Liu 
and other Review supporters. He 
said he and other councilmembers 
wrongly made assumptions the 
Review's editorial staff. Tom prom-
ised to "not let this happen again." 

"I didn't think it'd tum out this 
way," he said. 

A.S. Commissioner of Commu-
nications James Fabionar read a let-
ter he submitted to Guardian edi-
tors, stating his opposition to the 
May 16 article that implied the Cali-
fornia Review could lose A.S. fOOd-
ing. 

"The article distorted the topic of 
the California Review's funding," 
Fabionar said. 

Commissioner of Operations! 
Services and Enterprises Erin Holve 
urged the Guardian, A.S. Council 
members and the California Review 
to work together to avoid future 
misunderstandings. 

"Miscommunication is going to 
happen," Holve said. 

While the controversial adver-
tisement drew much of the talk dur-
ing last night's meeting, the council 
also addressed fiscal issues, passing 
by consensus its 1996-97 Executive 
Budget. The budget followed the 
A.S. Finance Committee's informal 
recommendations, which were made 
at its Monday meeting. 

The new budget allocates 
$753,765 for the A.S.'s projected 
needs for next year. 

Sabatini, who took part in the 
formation of the proposed budget 
and allended the finance meeting, 
said she wasexcited both because of 
the efforts of all councilmembers 
involved and due to finally resolv-

Sun God Festival 1998: 
'We Failed Mi ..... bly' 

When UCSO students arrived at Friday's Sun God Festival at !he 
Price Center, they may have been unpleasantly surprised to find 
themselves shut out of the evening concerts - at OfIiy 10 p.rn. And 
those who actually made it into the festival discovered that the music 
ended a half-hour before originally scheduled - ar 11:30 p.m. What 
was wrong with this year's Sun God Festival? Let us count the ways. 

The annual Sun God Festival should have been for UCSD 
students only. Students funded and planned the festival, and should 
have been allowed into the concert when they showed up a lillie late. 
Unfortunately, the UCSO administration decided to enforce a police 
state, drifting into complete security paranoia after students started to 
pany for .the fll'St time all year. 

Closing off the concert was a poorly thought-out act, no matter 
how crowded the Price Center was perceived as being. Despite a 
clear space on the Library Walk - which was pari of the enclosed 
grounds - students crowded into the plaza because the guards were 
more concerned about keeping people out of the festival than 
dispersing the growing crowd in the "pit." And as people left the 
event, thus making more room for people to enter, those who arrived 
late were still denied admission. 

The end result was an overcrowded mess in the Price Center 
floor, while the Library Walk was bam:n. The security guards did 
not move those in the pit to the Library Walk, so as to allow for more 
students to enter, and they did not clear out the areas near the 
railings, where students were dangerously packed like sardines. 

Although the administration's security efforts were clearly 
successful in one sense - by squashing all effons for UCSO 
students to enjoy their own event - they are not completely to 
blame. UCSD students also contributed to this year's disasterous 
party. Simply put, students abused the system, which allowed for 
each student to invite one guest. UCSD students snuck in several 
high school students, went out of the gates and entered again with a 
new balCh. This ultimately kept out many UCSD students. 

A common-sense solution for this inundation of underage guests 
would be to have security mark the 1.0. cards of those UCSO 
students who bring guests. Or perhaps those who wished to bring a 
guest could have signed up on a list beforehand_ 

The poorly planned evening festivities are evidence of Sun God 
Chair Kathy Lee's lack of organization - the music ended early; 
one band dropped out before the festival began; the festival was 
diffused away from the Sun God itself, so as not to disturb the 
Faculty Club - and the campus administration's lack of communi-
cation with the festival's security employees. 

It was the one night when ucsD resembles what other college 
campuses are like every weekend, and we failed miserably. 

If Students Do the Crime, 
They Should Do the Time 

On March 12, 18 UCSD students blocked an intersection on La 
Jolla Village Drive as pan of a prOlest against the proposed Califor-
nia Civil Rights Initiative. These students were engaging in civil 
disobedience to call attention to an issue they felt was important - a 
practice that has been utilized by the likes of Dr. Manin Luther King, 
Jr., Gandhi and Henry David Thoreau. 

However, the students do not grasp the concept of civil disobedi-
ence. One of the main tenets of such action is accepting the punish-
ment that comes with bl'eaking the law. 

The students from the protest chose to break the law by blocking 
the intersection and refusing to move when the police instructed 
them to do so. But instead of accepting the consequences of their 
actions quietly, they whined that they were being singled out, as part 
of some great conspiracy surrounding the Republican National 
Convention. Fonner A.S. President Naomi Falk, one of the students 
am:sted at the protest. went as far as to claim that the students were 
being treated in a "differential" manner and that the city's prosecu-
tion of the protesters is politically motivated. 

However, the city is treating the protesters exactly as it treats 
others involved in breaking the law - like criminals. Their breaking 
the law for a cause in which they believe in does not make them 
immune to discipline. 

If the protesters believe their cause is so important, then they 
should be happy to take whatever punishment they receive - to 
draw further attention to their ideals. ThIlt would be the anitude of a 
true practitioner of civil disobedience. If the protesters can't do the 
time, then they shouldn't have done the crime.

PINION 

NOT EVERY SENIOR IS READy 
To GRADAU'IE 

COMMENTARY: Graduation is not a testament to hard work, but 
rather a chance for students to sit and brood over what awaits them 

D ere k 

HA 
The Voice of 

Reason 

Of all the rituali tic tradi -
tions that have exceeded their 
usefulness, none is more de-
pressing and inappropriate 
than the college graduation 
ceremony. As if college se-
niors didn 't already have 
enough worries about leaving 
school, they are virtually 
forced to partake in this te-
dious episode. 

Granted, they do have the 
option not to 
walk in com-
mencement, 
but something 

faster than the average high school graduate, or they 
can think quickly when the register breaks down at 
McDonald's. And at least they will know that they 
have degrees. Perhaps that will be of some comfort 
as they /lip their burgers .... 

As for hard work, I must have missed that part of 
college. Granted, sometimes students' schedules can 
be hectic, with classes and work and friends . But on 
the whole, I found myself with a hell of a lot more 
free time than my parents or most other working folk . 
Sure, they have no homework. but they come home 
from the office in the evening and have little energy 

compels us all 
to participate. Most likely, it's our 
parents urging us to do so. Because 
even if we don't want to commemo-
rate our own achievements, we must 
at least let them commemorate their 
own - putting a child through col-
lege. Moreover, unless all your 
friends agree not to participate, 
you'll probably be one of the only 
ones not there. And a tiny voice from 
our consciences tell s us that we 
might regret that several years down 
the road. Thus, we walk. 

In theory, the graduation cer-
emony is supposed to celebrate not 
just a student's achievement and 
hard work over the past four years, 
but also his progress through life in

Besides, once one gets into the rou-

nize just how much work is neces-
sary 10 get by. Toward the third and 
fourth years of school, that amount 
grows increasingly smaller until one 
recognizes how little work actually 
needs to be done. The rest of the time 
can be spent having fun with friends 
or lounging around during the middle 
of the day. We actually get diplomas 
for this? 

Graduation is also supposed to 
commemorate an end. (And possibly 
a beginning for those who worked 
hard.) Bul why the hell would I want 
to commemorate an end to something 
that I don ' t want to end? I have no 
desire to leave college. What gradu-
ation really signifies is an end to all 
the fun things in life. Never again 
will we be able to live in such close 
proximity to all our best friends . In-
stead, we have to suffer the depress-
ing ritual of saying goodbye to all the 
friends we made over the past four

schools. But then there are the rest of us without

So what have these less successfu I students 
achieved? Well, cenainly they should feel proud of

is the most horrible reminder that the best times in 
life are now ending; and that we will never again be

Instead, we will spend over 80 percent of our 
waiting hours in an office. And if it turns out that 
you don't like your co-workers, then you're just out

he must either

ray of academic disci -

judge them, aside from 
the empty, but impres-
sive, self-promoting blurb 
each department give it-
self in the General Cata-
log. For all the undecided 
students who sense a bit 
of duplicity and wonder 
what the majors actually 
consist of, I present the

BloIoIY/Blochemlstry (Pre-med) 

For those insanely ambitious enough to 
want to compete against the 800 other pre-
meds in your Biochem/O-Chem and Mam-
malian Physiology classes, a biology ma-
jor represents a viable choice. If you are 
good at memorizing long strings of unre-
lated trivia and can regurgitate them under 
the pressure of a midterm or final exam, bi-
ology or biochem might be a good choice. 
While it could be argued that the ability to 
memorize worthless trivia might not be the 
best criteria for admission to medical 
school, imagine all the fun those late-night 
games of Trivial Pursuit must be at medi -
cal schools around the country. 

If you are Asian, this particular di lemma 
is easier to face: Because your role in life 
is to give your parents something to brag 
about to their friends at Mah-Jhong parties, 
you are faced with the simple decision of 
majoring in engineering, a physical science, 

You watched Mr. Wiz-
ard religiously as a kid because you loved 
to point out scientific inconsistencies in his 
experiments. This later translated into ex-

ten misunderstood cogs of 
the corporate machine, whose sole comfort 
rests in the knowledge that they are the only 
ones who truly understand "Dilbert." 

On the other hand, bear in mind that you 
will spend more than four years fighting a 
pack of the most ambitions piranhas ever 
assembled in a classroom. This means that 
study groups are largely impossible to form

An actual department within the

the earth:science specialty allows 
one to substitute earth-science elec-

full chemistry and physics students 
as "Chern Lite" and "Physics For

A shrewd choice for the lazy

to have your afternoons free, do the 
opposite. Also, as students, we have 
more say in determining our work 
hours; after all, we have to sched-
ule work around our classes. Full-
time work rarely offers the oppor-
tunity to spend an afternoon at the 
beach or an entire day in bed. )n-
stead, it offers only monotony, 
something college life seldom sees. 

Granted, the working life does 
pose some benefits as opposed to 
college; at least we will be making 
money - maybe. And there is al-
ways the possibility that we will 
become successful and can set our 
own hours in the workplace. But, on 
the whole, l'1I take college life.

Economic. 
Also known as a dumping 

ground for failed science/engi-
neering majors. It has been said 
that anyone who calls himself an 
economics major, then goes out 
and spends $80 on an economics 
textbook, should be failed on prin-
ciple. This is true. 

Of course, high allrition is bad 
in a course of study designed for 
people who already burned out of 
science, so the course load is de-
signed around elementary calcu-
Ius and grade-school reading . 
Marginally useful courses in op-
erations research and finance will 
give you a small edge when you 
interview for work as a bank teller 
after graduation. 
Political Science 

Searching desperately to vali-
date themselves as real "sci en-
tists," poli-sci professors are end-
lessly engaged in meaningless re-
gressions and data mining of his-
tory to predict the future with in-
creasingly ridiculous theories. 
Political science is an excellent 
choice if you are supported by 
your parents, as political-science 
classes are notorious for assigning 
hundreds of dollars of worthless 
books that 'you will read only once

Also known as a dumping

The field of psychology seems to 
be disturbingly fascinated by rats. 
I rememberreading an experiment

cation is so valuable, we'll all be 
sitting there, not listening to a single 
word, and thinking of how great 
college life has been. . 

We'll think how it seems like 
only yesterday that we were mov-
ing into our freshmen dorms. We'll 
lament having to depart from our 
best friends. The end of college 
means an end to freedom and the 
onset of massive responsibility; and 
it marks the passing of time and the 
approach of old age. 

On top of this brooding during 
the ceremony, we have the oppor-
tunity to sweat uncomfortably in 
suits and dresses, and to go out to 
dinner with long-lost family mem-
bers that we haven't seen in years . 

about an rat whose pleasure cen-
ter was directly wired to a bar. As 
anyone with a bit of imagination 
could have told you, the rat kept 
hilling the lever over and over 
until we had to read about the rat 
in a college psychology textbook. 

The only sensible thing to arise 
from the entire field of psychology 
is an observation a friend of mine 
once made, talking about rats in a 
maze: "You take away the incentive 
-the food reward at the end of the 
maze, and they'll eventually stop. 
That's the difference between hu-
mans and rats -the rats eventually 
stop." 

The only thing psychology will 
do is make you lose faith in human 
nature. And who needs that? Choose 
again. 
Physic. 

As one who has suffered through 
the entire Physics 4 sequence, I have 
concluded that physics is God's way 
of telling us that there are certain 
things we mortals just shouldn't 
know. When getting 30 percent on 
midterms and finals earns an "A" 
in an upper-division class in me-
chanics, you know something is

confused than you. The only good

If we must commemorate such a 
depressing !!Vent, we could at least 
make it less formal and more enjoy-
able. 

Sure, every graduate feels some 
sense of accomplishment. And the 
ceremony lets parents ~ who ap-
preciate the importance of a degree 
far more than this generation of stu-
dents - shower their children with 
love and pride. And gifts. But for 
students with nothing to look for-
ward to after that fatal day, it is ex-
tremely difficult to look forward to 
the event itself. 

Considering such depressing 
facts, the average college senior 
approaches graduation focusing on 
one common thought: I'm not ready 
yet. 

a bunch of straight-"A" physics 
guys to work on the Shuttle. Little 
do most people realiz.e that these 
physicists earned their straight-" As" 
being wrollg 70 percent of the time. 
Only an economist can be wrong 
more often and still draw a healthy 
salary. 
Women'. Studl .. 

When I started college, I saw the 
Women's Studies Department and 
major and thought, "Holy Cow ! 
Imagine gelling units and even a 
degree for something I do al ready!" 

Visions of earning four units per 
quarter for having a girlfriend were 
shattered with brutal clarity. For in-
stead of long hours of "field work" 
rating the scantily clad models that 
rollerblade along Pacific Beach, one 
is forced to sit through dry lectures 
on the evils of white heterosexual 
men. 

The first thing I'll do after I 
graduate is file a class-action law-
suit against the Women's Studies 
Department for false advertising. 
Who knows, with the legal system 
the way it is, women's studies might 
just be the quickest road to finan-
cial independence. You have to have 
a sense of humor to appreciate the 
irony of it all. 

And if you still can't figure out 
what you want to do for the rest of 
your life, well, I guess that's what 
grad school is for.

employees are currently restricted 
to working 20 hours per week. How-
ever, many complain that they can-
not keep their hours this low as class 
sizes continue to rise. 

"As a result, we feel undergradu-
ate education suffers," political-sc i-
ence grader Matt Smith said. ''The 
more time we spend grading papers. 
the less time we have to talk to 
students." 

Although student employees cur-
rently have the right to file griev-
ances regarding workplace condi-
tions, excessive workload was re-
moved from the list of grievance 
issues in 1992. 

Student employees are currently 
gi ven health-care benefits, but Bums 
said those benefits are not in writ-
ing, and therefore not guaranteed. 

"We're worried about the ero-

sion of our health·insunnce ben· 
efilS, and we have no denral or opti-
cal coverage," communications 
graduate student Jocl Beeson said. 
'The cost of dependent care is com-
pletely out of the range that most 
students can afford here." 

Academic student employees-
such as teaching assistants, researcb 
assistants, readers and graders -
are not recognized by the university 
as employees because they are also 
students. 

According to David Sorter of the 
Office of Graduate Studies and Re-
search, the law currently makes a 
distinction between true university 
employees and student employees 
who make their livings through aca-
demically related activities. 

However, Sorter said that, as stu-
dents, the employees have rights 
they can exercise, and that the other 
avenues of redress for grievances 
have not been fully uti lized. 

Communications Teaching As-
sistant Suzanne Thomas disagreed 
with Sorter's assessment.

"If I'm working for the univer-
sity, I should be recognized as an 
employee - not just a mentor," 
Thomas said. 

The question of student-em-
ployee unionization is currently be-
ing resolved in several courtrooms 
around the state, and Saner said the 
university feels it is "premature at 

this point to talk about this." 
Sorter added that he expeclS a 

resolution of the issue once the vari-
ous hearings are completed, butthat 
until then, theuniversity is not break-

. ing any laws. 
Bums said a decision last Octo-

ber by Judge James Tamm of the 
California Public Employment Re-
lations Board confirmed student 
employees' right to union represen-
tation. The university's appeal to 
the decision is still pending. 

Bums said she expects the case 
to be discussed in court for several 
more years before anything is le-
gally resolved. 

'They're tying up [the Employ-
ment Relations Board's decision] in 
courts in order to not enforce it," she 
said. 

Smith said the university could 
legally recognize the union at any 
time but chooses not to do so. 

"We don't understand why 
they'd rather see us out on strike 
than at the bargaining table in a fair 
process of negotiation," Union

Steward'sCouncil membcrMelanie 
Jennings said. "All we want is to 
have the same righlS as other em-
ployees on campus." 

The faIl strike will be organized in 
concert with unions at UC Be~e1ey 
and UC Los Angeles, both of which 
have already voted to strike. In addi-
tion, strike votes are expected from 
academic student employees at UC 
Santa Barbara and UC Santa Cruz. 

"We are definitely trying to or-
ganize across the entire system," 
Bums said. 

The union has not yet decided 
how long the strike will last, but 
union members said they are con-
cerned that an ongoing strike may 
seriously impact undergraduateedu-
cation and result in a harsh response 
from the university. 

''The ideal scenario would be that 
the university would simply recog-
nize the union without the strike," 
Smith said. 

UCSD administrators would not 
comment on what kind of response 
an ongoing strike would elicit.

Athol 'Fugard's post-apartheid production, set in present-
day South Africa, explores the life of an aspiring singer 

With "Valley Song," South African play-
wright Athol Fugard successfully writes him-
self into a narrative about Veronica Jonkers 
(Akousa Busia), a 17-year-old African girl 
striving to escape the confines of her small 
town. 

Based on his own life experience, 
Fugard's play concerns the con-
flicts that arise when a white 
writer wishes to buy the prop-
erty owned by Veronica's 
grandfather of mixed racial 
descent, Abraham "Buks" 
Jookers (Max Wright). 

Although the play touch-
es upon the lingering rem-
nants of racism, the play's 
main theme concerns Veron-
ica's coming-of-age 

and the difficulty her grandfather faces in let-
ting her go her own way. 

Set in New Betheseda, South 
Africa - Fugard's hometown -
the play opens with Buks' reflec-
tions of his daughter (Veronica's 

mother), who is buried in an 
unmarked grave in Johan-

nesberg and his wife, 
who has recently 
passed away. 

Veronica dreams 
of becoming a famous singer. 

The white writer (also played by Wright) tries 
to console Veronica after eeing her peekipg at 

singers in the window one evening, 
but has no more luck than her 
grandrather. 

The connict between Veronica 
and her grandfather is resolved 
rather quickly and a bit too cleanly. 
Yet, fine performances by Busia 
and Wright make the endi ng believ-
able. Busia does a remarkable job 
of capturi ng Veronica's adolescent 

exuberance and Wright succeeds as both the 
old-fashioned grandfalher and the writer with 
mixed feelings about buying the land. 

"Valley Song" runs through June 
15 at the La Jolla Playhou e.

Twister 
It's a whirlwind 

summer 

blockbuster 
By Rebecca Hall 
Staff Writer 

In a city where weather reports are 
absurdly unnecessary - bad weather 
boils down to no surf. and storms are, at 
the worst, strong enough to mess up your 
hair - San Diegans should rush to the 
theater to see the amazing tribute to 
extreme atmospheric conditions seen in 
the new film, 7Wisl~r.

Mind Science of tbe Mind 
Members of Shudder to Think, Helium 

and the Dambuilders brainstorm 
By Esther Yoon 
Hiatus Editor 

"Old punk rock friends" Nathan 
Larson (of Shudder to Think) , 
Mary Timony (of Helium), and 
Joan Wasser (of the Dambuilders) 
- in a rushed, two-week jam ses-
sion - grouped to create 
Mind Science of the 
Mind. 

"We'vc all been great 
pals for a long time and 
had wanted to book 
some studio time togeth-
er," said Larson, in a 
recent interview with the 
Guardian. "So we just 
went ahead with it to see 
what would happen." 

With drummer Kevin March, 
also of the Dambuilders, the end 
result of thi jam session was Mind 
Science of the Mind's self-titled 
LP, which departs from the tradi-
tional hardcore styles of the musi-
cians involved. The collaboration 
of these artists results in an unex-
pected "glam rock" sound, recall-
ing '70s rock groups Queen and 
Pink' Floyd. 

In his interview, Larson shared 
his sentiments towards his recent-
project, as well as his experiences 
working with Timony and Wasser. 
GIIM"dIMr: What exactly is 

MISSION: 
Slick pI0ves, good 
looks carry film 
ContInued from pille 12 
captures and enthralls its audience. 
However, the film's jumpy, fast-
paced script is hard to follow, as 
well as the duality of its characters. 

It's a challenge distinguishing 
the good guys in this film from the 
bad. The dismal message relayed is 
that everyone devalues loyalty for 
greed, u even Hunt questions 
whether to sell intemltional inteUi-
gcnce to the black marlcet. 

Most of the acton give weak 

"Mind Science of the 
Mind"? 

Larson: I liked it as a name 
because of the repetition of the 
words. It was really ungamely-
sounding. It sounds like some 
obscure field of study. 

Where did you &et 
the Idea to do this 
side project? 

r had known Mary 
[Timony, the guitarist 
from Helium], since high 
school, so we were pals, 
and I always thought she 
was incredibly cool. 
She's a great musician, 
plus she was a girl, and at 

that time, you just didn't see girls 
knowing the theory and having a 
deep understanding of rock music 
theory - classic music, maybe. I 
always wanted to work with Joan 
and Mary. When I knew Mary, I 
was just like this punk guy, and she 
had already learned a lot about 
music in every aspect. 
Who wrote the sones on the 
album? 

I wrote ten songs. and we all 
collaborated on one of them, and 
we just went in and did it. I'm real-
ly happy with the sound of the 
album, and particularly with the 
girls. The drummer, Kevin March 

performanc~s, only supported by 
slick moves and good looks. 
Cruise's character has no substance 
beyond his delivery of intense 
scenes. Beart looks the part of a 
mysterious seductress, but plays 
into her role as a nonentity. 

As a revered veteran within 
international spy rings, Voight's 
character Phelps turns out to be the 
vi llain, jaded by his experiences 
with an unjust U.S. government. 
Phelps' cop-out rationalizations of 
greed and justice get tiresome, and 
fail to explain or establish the char-
acter's nature. 

The only entertaining perfor-
~ in this film is Rhames', 

from the Dambuilders, is great, too. 
How was It .. workin& 
with the women on this pro-
ject? 

I love these particular girls, but 
I can't make general statements 
about women. Women in rock - in 
my experiences in dealing with 
Joan (Wasser, of the Dambuilders] 
and Mary - are something of a 
novelty. With most women, 
bccause there aren't that many of 
them in music, even if their output 
is mediocre, they're encouraged, so 
girls feel like they only have to 
advance to a certain point. ] think 
that when you come upon ladies 
who are really committed to their 
crafl and constantly being studcnts 
of music, it's a rare thing. 
50 you feel that female 
musicians are .... inclined 
to commit themseIve.? 

Oh no, it's a rare thing for men, 
too. A lot of bands think they can 
strip to the bare minimum. It's not 
gcnder-spccific, though. Once you 
start giving positive feedback, 
musicia'ls just get stagnant. 
What was it like recordinc in 
two weeks? 

Oh, it was great. 11 couldn't 
have happened if we thought it out 
too much. This made the whole 
album intense and strong. 

whose stable character also pro-
vides some of the comic relief 
between the film 's high strung, sus-
pense-ridden scenes. 

What salvages this film are the 
explosions, the European scenery, 
the sexy leads and, of course, its 
catchy theme song. (On a side note, 
the film is accompanied by a fine 
soundtrack, featuring the theme 
song, as well as new music from 
Bjork, Massive Attack and Pulp.) 

Nevertheless, audiences will be 
pleased with the dynamic effect of

he played with in the band Crimp-
shrine, wearing a leather jacket and 
promoting skinhead violence. 

This time around, the bnd seems 
more serious than they did, and so 
does the music. Fifteen . moves 
towards a simpler sound. Gone are 
the melodic guitar leads, and the 
chorus vocals. The songs are faster, 
bouncier, comparable to Jawbreaker 
or J Church. 

The result is a sound quite unlike 
their early songs. It's not necessarily 
better, but it represents a band that 
has continually tried to experiment 
and reinvent itself. 

The best track of Surprise! is a 
piano ballad reworked into a guitar 
song that they can play live.

TWISTER: 
Special effects spice 
up blockbuster film 
Continued from page 11 
week with record-breaking atten-
dance. 

So while the plot of this incredi-
bly filmed, roller coaster of a movie 
is really bad, the movie doesn't diss-
apoint its audience. 

Beyond all elsr., the special 
effects are exciting, and the endless 
stonn sequcnces are scary enough to 
induce screams from its audience 
and an invigorating feeling of spuri-
ous terror. Unlike many "based on 
real life" thrillers, there are no real 
tragedies, and the moral lessons are 
thankfully kept to a bare minimum. 

1Wisrer indulges the voyeuristic 
desire in all of us to see danger up 
close, but it also provides some great 
supporting characters and good act-
ing - that is, for the times when 
tanker trucks aren't falling out of the 
sky.

After fi ve full albums, three 
EP's and heavy exposure on 
1993 's Lollapalloza tour, Fishbone 
ranks as one of the most influential 
bands to never "breakthrough." 
However, with little help from 
mainstream-radio and MTV, Fish-
bone has somehow asserted its 
staying power in the music indus-
try. 

With its newest release, Fish-
bone achieves a level of maturity 
unseen in earlier albums. The dark 
and driven nature of this album's 
songs seem autobiographical, 
resulting in a combination of abil-
ity and innovation seldom seen in 
pop music. 

Fishbone pulls off its fusion of 
contrasting musical genres, partic-
ularly in the funk and two-tone ska 
sty les compiled in "In the Cube," 
as well as the thrash-metal style of 
"Chim-Chim."

Open Minds 
Community Actors Theater draws locals 
By~Boyce 
Contributing Hiatus Writer 

In southeast San Diego on 
Imperial Avenue, there 
is a hole in the wall of a 
concrete building. The 
place appears to be 
unoccupied - almost 
abandoned - but peri-
odically, artists of all 
genres converge upon 
the scene to waken a 
sleeping beast. It is then 
that this building with a 
stage becomes the Community 
Actors Theater (CAT). 

CAT has welcomed actors, 
singers, poets, hip-hop artists and 
musicians by supplying the space 
for numerous plays and for such 
shows as the Underground 
Improv and Black Rage On 
Stage. 

In an environment where the 
R&B/rap music scene is dominat-

ed by the likes of Jammin' Z90, 
local talent is often overlooked. 
However, persistence and tenaci-

ty payoff, and artists 
gain some recognition 
by exploring local 
venues. CAT is just one 
of the locations that 
provides an arena for 
eKpression that is 
specifically soul, R&B 
and jazz based. 

The latest exhibi-
tion of talent has been 

presented in the "Open Minds" 
poetry series. "Open Minds," 
originated in 1994 by Crystal 
Allen and Lauri Conner in Seat-
tle, brings together anists from 
various cultural backgrounds. 
These artists shared Seattle's 
New Orleans Jazz Cafc for a 
monthly showcase of poetry and 
jazz.

Vinnie Paul's drumming is the 
highlight of Pantera's last album: 
His furious double-bass footwork 
crashes Ihrough the wailing guitars 
of Oimebag Darrell, especially on 
the ferocious "13 Steps to 
Nowhere," 

"War Nerve" brings 10 mind 
early Melallica, with its four-horse-
men style raging ahead and slowing 
down; it leaves the listener abused 
and gasping for breath, and wonder-
ing where the next salvo is coming 
from. 

For the most part, lead singer 
Philip Anselmo's rich voice is 
squandered as he is forced to wail 
over the lOp of the musical chaos. 
However, there are exceptions when 
the band slows down enough to give 
his vocals room to roam,

Jazz artist PhanIo Sanders'latest 
release, aptly titled Meswge From 
Home, reflects a West African moIif 
stylistically unknown to his earlier 
albums. 

While the saxophonist's previ-
ous works featured native and spir-
itually-inspired themes, the heavy 
congas and tab las set a heaving 
backdrop for Message From 
Home. 

This heavy, distracting sound is 
particularly ineffective in the first 
song off the album, "Our Roots 
(Began in Africa)," which lags inter-
minably. 

Marred only by an over-done 
percussive attempt, Sanders' own 
mesmenzmg musical abilities 
secure his place amongst the fore-
runners of contemporary jazz.

Ghost in the Shell 
". 

Anime cyberpunk-thriller 
explores new life forms 

By o.n 0kIIda 
Staff~er 

Mamoru Oshii sets new prece-
dence in the field of animation with 
his epic cyberpunk thriller Ghost in 
the Shell. Not since Otomo's 1989 
Atira has so much been invested 
into a feature-length anime movie, 
and it clearly shows. 

Although claims have been 
made proclaiming many anime 
films as the "next Atira," few are 
deserving of this compliment as 
Ghosl. Progress in animation tech-
niques, including the seamless 
melding of traditional cell and digi-
tized animation, puts life into the 
characters of Ghost - created by 
world renown manga artist, 
Masamune Shirow. ,

soundtrack used throughout compli-

through contact with the worldwide 
network of data.

being and requests political asylum 
as well as a physical shell to inhabit, 
calling itself the Puppet Master. This 
major security breach leads to a race 
between two enforcement agencies 
to recover the Puppet Master and 
halt its plans for independence. 

But the Puppet Master is highly 

decillion of rnerging with him to cre-
ate a new form of life. 

The cerebral theme of Ghost is 
not intended for a younger audience, 
for reasons beyond the ultra violence 
and periodic nudity, Many viewers 
may have difficuhy grasping the 
phi Iosophical issues that question 
human existence in a world of 
expanding technologies that enable 
civilization to create both artifICial 
bodies as well as "ghosts," But there 
is nothing empty about this Shell's

Cold Comfort Farm 
An eccentric cast of 

characters inhabits the farm 
By Sehra Han 

S[aff~[er 

"I saw something nasty in the 
woodshed," screeched Ada Doom, 
the crusty matriarch of 
Cold Comfort Farm . . 

Nobody knows whal 
she saw, bUI, apparently, 
the memory haunted her 
so heinously that she'd 
shul herself up in the 
bedroom and hadn't 
stepped foot outside in 
years. 

Ada Doom ruled the 
roost from behind her b:droom 
door, opening it only to take in 
trays of food or to shout out orders 
to the family. In over 20 years, 
Ada's number-one rule had never 
been broken: Never leave Cold 
Comfort Farm. 

The decrepit, eccentric Ada 
Doom is just one of the many 
memorable characters in Gramer-
cy Picture's new comedy, Cold 
Comfort Farm. Adapted from a 
classic English novel published in 
the I 930s, this film inimitably 
captures the full flavor of these 

garden-variety eccentrics. It 
proves to a 21 st- century audience 
that the farm charm of Stella Gib-
bon's classic story still has mod-

em appeal. 
The characters and 

their bumpkin way of 
life al Cold Comfort 
Farm are sharply imag-
ined. A fire and brim-
stone preacher and a for-
est-frolicking nature 
nymph are among the 
colorful characters that 
inhabit Cold Comfort. 

All of this is about to change 
when cousin Flora, a young woman 
with a "strong will and a well-
turned ankle," travels in from Lon-
don and decides that she will take 
on Cold Comfort as her new pro-
ject. She intends to tidy up and she 
doesn't just mean the farm; she 
means the relatives too. 

The ensuing incidents play with 
the audience, presenting questions 
that the film will never answer and 
making significant that which, at 
first, seem highly insignificant. 

During the first hour, the film 

The Gel ... n...n will fiddle the night a'N<tj at the Casbah on Frid<tj.

delivers jusl enough to sustain 
interest; but like the familiar task of 
having to lick through the candy 
coating before finally reaching the 
tootsie center, the result is worth iL 

The film, like the characters in it, 
doesn't overexert itself to please the 
viewers nor does it give in to their 
expectations. It entertains at its own 
leisure, finally winning the audience 
over with its subtle charms. TIle 
end, then, if one can wait for it, is as 
remarkable as it is satisfying.

REBUILDING YEAR ENDS, ~RCIFULL Y, AT 11·30 

See how that last lead sounds 
like music 10 your ears? It practi-
cally sings to you. With this new 
type of pop-culture sports writing, 
Americans would be privy 10 
phrases such as: Cowboys' defen-
sive back Deion Sanders hit the 

Gone are tenns like: Brett Butler 
will now have to undertake a 
Dantean task to cure his cancerous 
throat - eight hellish hours of sur-
gery and follow-up chemotherapy, 
only to be replaced by a much bet-
ter, simpler summary: Brett Butler 
will now foce the music like Spock 
did in Star Trek 3. 

This new type of "average loe" 
writing could revolutionize the 
sponing world as we know it. But it 
all depends on the sports writers 
loosening up their high-and-mighty 
standards. And right now, they're as 
stubborn against changing as Mr, T 
is against flying. 

As the UCSD women's soft-
ball team struggled through a sea-
son ofrebuilding, it was often left 
frustrated, searching for 
any kind of an offensive 
auack. The light-hitting 
UCSD bats forced Triton 
Head Coach Patricia 
Gerckens into desperately 
trying to manufacture runs 
any way she could. 

"I knew that we were 
going to struggle this 
year," Gerckens said. 
"But we should have won more 
games." 

The Tritons returned only one 
player from last year's team, fore-
ing the squad to start four freshmen 
on a regular basis - a factor that 
helped contribute to lhe team's lop-
sided record of 11 -30. Inexperi-
ence, lack of depth and an unfamil-
iarity with Gerckens' syslem made 
for a dissapointing year. 

First-year pitchers Sara Burns 
and Mary Jane Duo were thrust 
into the starting rolalion without 
the benefit of a red-shirt year to 
help hone their skills. 

Burns (6-15) is an outslanding 
all-around athlete with innate 
base-running skills, while 0110 
(5-15) has developed a puzzling 
off-speed pitch and could become 
the Tritons' ace in the future . 

Fellow freshman ballerymate 
Sara Snyder caught all but one of 

UCSD's 41 games this year and 
should become a leader in the 
coming years. 

What little offense the 
Tritons did muster was 
paced by the surprising 
emergence of slap-hit-
ting outfielder Jessica 
Plancich. Plancich over-
came an early season 
slump to push her team-
leading balling average 
to .330. 

Third baseman Chris-
tine Mann was the Tritons' only 
graduating senior and their lone 
returning player from last year. 
Mann hit .307 on the season to 
raise her UCSD career mark to 
.280, while showing remarkable 
improvement over the course of 
the year at the hot corner. 

While Mann has concluded 
her playing days as a Triton, fel-
low senior Adrienne Vasquez still 
has Division III eligibility, and 
Gerckens is hoping that she will 
relurn to the diamond next sea-
son to provide some leadership 
in the infield. 

"[Vasquez] made some unbe-
lievable plays that saved games," 
Gerckens said. "She was also one 
of our beSI bunters." 

Shortstop Missy Belmer, first 
baseman Shannon Reider and 
Melissa Aguilar should round oul 
the rest of the rest of a veteran 

infield nex t year 
Although lack of depth and 

experience plagued UCSD this 
season, the future looks bright -
assuming the nucleus of the team 
stays together. 

The Tritons invested a lot of 
time and effon into learning how 
to play together, and the progress 
they made bodes well for seasons 
to come. 

It has become an overwrought 
cliche, bul it still holds true: The 
best thing about freshmen is that 
they become sophomores. This 
year's crop of Triton rookies 
should return nell season along 
with the upperclassmen to enact 
some revenge on their Division 
UI foes. 

Chrtst.ne M_: The only 
returning player from last 
year's team, Christine raised 
her career average with a 
,307 mark, while "Mann-"ing 
the hot corner.

Donahue-
Not Dante 

If there's one thing I'm 
tired of, it' s grandiose sports 
comparisons. It seems as if 
every hack journalist from po-
dunk weeklies to big-time 
outfits, like Sports Illustrated, 
is fond of using these kinds of 
confusing epic analogies to 
describe sporting events. 

The end result of these 
comparisons is that a throw-
away NBA game between two 
cellar-dwelling learns comes 
off like the Second Coming of 
Christ: The Clippers ' Stanley 
Roberts, like the Biblical 
David, slew the mighty 
Washington Bullets last night, 
tossing in 10 points and 

a: grabbing two rebounds. Or 
how about this silly classicist 
lead?: The mythical Trojans 
mtly have been tricked with 
false gifts. but the USC Trojans 
were on the receiving end of a 
last-second present. in the form 
of an interception, from UCLA 
quarterback Troy Aikmtlll .... 

Let 's face it, the average 
ports!watching American is 

an illiterate, beer-guzzling, 
channel-surfing, "Riki Lake"-
watching, Fruit Roll-Up-
munching, waistline-higher-
than-his-I.Q: type of person. 
The closest this sports creature 
has ever come to the Parthenon 
is Caesar's Palace. And 
mention the Biblical character 
"Job" to this kind of human 
being, and he's likely to start 
bitching about overtime pay. 

Which gets me to my main 
point: It's high time for elitist 
sports writers to come down 
from their high horses and start 
using analogies more familiar 
to the common man. It' s time 
for the Jim Murrays, the Scott 
Ostlers and the Peter Vesseys 
of the world to leave their 
ivory towers and start writing 
in a language all Americans -
whether admirers of Oprah or 
Phil, Twinkies or Ding-Dongs 
- can understand. 

Of course, the first step is 
for writers to toss out all those 
complex terms, such as 
"superfluous effort," "pressure 
defense," and "player substitu-
tion." The second step is to fill 
each sports story with as many 
photos and graphics as 
possible, keeping the cumber-
some text to an absolute 
minimum. 

But the final and most impor-
tant step is for sports writers to 
delve into the vast vault of Ameri-
can pop-culture for all analogies, 
metaphors or tricky leads. For
