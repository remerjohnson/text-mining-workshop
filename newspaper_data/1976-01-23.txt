The first publicized teach-in held 
at a university on US involvement 
in the Angolan civil war evoked a 
mixed but energetic response from 
many of the estimated 375 persons 
in attendence Tuesday night. A 
packed auditorium in the new

the mounting opposition of 
students and the community to US

Councils To Discuss BOA 
Control of Student Center 

by Mark Stadler 
News Editor 

Members of the college councils, 
the Student Cooperative and the 
Graduate Student Council (GSC) 
will meet Wednesday at 8 p.m. to 
discuss and fonn a unified student 
position on the proposed Board of 
Authority (BOA), which would 
control operation of the student 
center. 

The gathering was scheduled 
after a meeting of the four councils 
Wednesday night. People at-
tending the meeting next week will 
form a committee to meet with 
Vice-chancellor and Dean of 
Student Affairs George Murphy to 
"hammer out" a compromise on 
the issue. 

The panel replaces a proposed 
committee which was initiated by 
Murphy and student center 
di rector Mark Bookman. That 
committee would have been 
composed of single representatives 
from the same groups that will 
meet next week. 

That committee was devised 
because the two administrators 
fclt there was " absolutely no 
progress" on the BOA proposal 
over the last 15 weeks, as Bookman 
put it yesterday. 

on the issue and that after a few 
meetings those objections could be 
worked out. 

Murphy's objections are in the 
area of the appointment 
procedure, renumeration for 
members and the board's policy 
making powers. 

In a recent interview Murphy 
said it would be unfair to single out 
BOA members for payment. " In 
any notion of fairness" other 
student committees like 
registration fee and the program 
review committee would also have 
to be considered for payment, 
Murphy said. . 

Bookman said yesterday the 
problem could be solved by other 
forms of renumeration-such as 
class credits or fee defennents. He 
said such methods have been used 
successfully at other universities, 
such as UCLA. 

However, he added that a " fair 
across the board" policy for all 
student committees must be 
worked out. 

Two NOplinees 

C'ity Counci'l 
Votes in Favor of 
Black's Nudity 

The San Diego City Council 
yesterday narrowly defeated a 
measure that would have ended 
nude sunbathing at Black's 
Beach, which has had a swim-
suits optional area since 1974. 

The vote was taken after a two 
and a half hour session, which 
saw opposition to the swimsuits-
optional area from the La Jolla 
Farms Assn. , the La jolla Town 
Council, the Pacific Beach Town 
Council and various religious 
groups. 

A member of the Nude Beaches 
Committee opposed the 
resolution to rescind. 

Council members voting 
against the motion were : Gil 
Johnson, Maureen O'Conner, 
Leon Williams, Floyd Morrow 
and Jess Haro. Favoring the 
resolution to ban nudity were Lee 
Hubbard, Tom Gade, Jim Ellis 
and Mayor Wilson. 

Johnson, who represents UC 
San Diego and the area including 
Black's, said he felt people would 
use the beach for nudity even if 
the council rescinded its 1974 
action. 

to t e concerns rats y mem ers 
of the audience. 

Gerald Bender and John Mar-
cum, who spoke in opposition to US 
military intervention in the 
domestic affairs of Angola, were 
critical of past American foreign 
policy towards Africa as a whole. 

Louis Gann, describing himself 
as an ultra conservative and anti-
communist, argued that South 
Africa was directly threatened by 
communist-supported guerilla 
movements, which would come 
from Angola , if the Soviet-backed 
MPLA forces are successful. 
According to Gann this would not 
be in the best interest of the U.S. 

Students who obviously had 
strong convictions concerning US 
involvement in Angola voiced 
protests that the issues dealt with 
by the panel debate were not 
getting to the heart of the matter. 
As debate ensued Bender con-
tended that the US had no stategic 
interest in Angola, while Gann 
insisted there was no such thing as 
US neo-colonialism in Africa and 
cited statis tical evidence to back. 
up his a sertion. 

Students reacted with some 
dismay at these conclusions. 

Marcum and Bende r maintained 
some optimism that an African 
solution will emerge to resolve the 
Angola conflict with a coalition 
goverrunent between the US-
backed UNITA and MPLA forces. 

Bender also addressed a 
question from the audience about 
the-possibility of continued querilla 
warfare by the FNLA forces which 
are also backed by the US, if a 
coalition is established between the 
MPLA and UNITA. In answer he 
said that " I'm afraid there will 
probably be a guerilla war at some 
time. One of the members of the 
FNLA political Bureau stated last 
week in Kinshasa that they were 
going to continue the struggle 
using what he called palestinian 
tactics of terrorism aimed at all 

those who support the MPLA 
around the world ." 

The symposium was held to 
" raise the level of public debate" 
so that any further commitment or 
involvement in Angola is made 
with full public knowledge and 
understanding, according to UC 
San Diego Professor, David 
Laitan. 

Both Laitin and Third College 
Provost Joseph Waton, who were 
the moving forces behind the 
teach-in, felt the attempt was 
successful in its goal to provide a 
forum and to educate the public, 
despite several problems that 
emerged which were not an-
ticipated. 

The source of one problem that 
did not become apparent to the 
sponsors before the symposium 
began, seemed to focus around 
Laitin's assumption that " America 
is still undecided, on the issue. 
Much of the audience appeared to 
disagree with Laitin, as evidenced 
by the ensuing dialogue and a 20 
foot sign calling for the support of 
the MPLA. 

An occurence, precluding the 
start of the evening debate , whIch 
threatened to upstage its 
significance, was when the State 
Department failed to send an of-
ficial representative to support US 
policy. 

According to Laitin, the State 
Dept. informed him that Edward 
Fugit of the Bureau of African 
Affairs had been called to Moscow 
by Sec. of State Henry Kissinger. 
Thomas Killoran, a State Dept. 
official who was also to appear, 
had to replace Fugit in 
Washington, Laitin said. Laitin 
said the State Dept. insisted that no 
one else was knowledgable enough 
to represent the departments 
position. 

The absence of State Dept. 
representatives did not lessen the 
attempts by some students to 
discredit the debate on the basis 
that, as one student shouted. " this 
is not a teach - in, this not what 
happened in Michigan in 1965, this 
is academic propaganda." 

The audience 's mood often 
tended to shift the debate away 
from the issue and toward personal 
attacks on Gann. This prompted 
some students and at least one 
African professor to confide that 
Gann should never been invited to 
UCSD. 

He was accused from the 
audience as being ... " one of the 
chief defenders of imperialism in 
Africa." 

Laitin emphasized, however,

Eight Members 

Murphy objected to the ap-
pointments procedure for board 
members. Currently the various 
groups are to forward two 
nominees to the Coop's ap-
pointments and evaluations action 
center, which makes the final 
choice. 

An Interview With Avrum Stroll 
The current BOA proposal sets 

up a panel of eight members, with 
representatives of the college 
councils, the Coop, the GSC, the 
Cra fts Center and the Student 
Information Center (EDNA). 

The original BOA proposal, 
worked out by a group of students 
last summer, had six members, 
from the councils, Coop and 
Graduate Student Union. . 

Although Murphy has several 
objections to BOA as currently 
structured, both he and Bookman 
fee l they are close to an agreement 

Money 
The Triton Times is looking for 

two or three hardworking in-
dividuals to work in its business 
depa rtment, for 10 to 15 hours a 
week. 

Th pay is $20 to $25 a week, plus 
a 10 percent commi~ion on all 
adv rtising sold above a certain 
weekly quota. 

Any ne interested should contact 
Business Manager Kenzie Nicoll, 
Or I ave It message with Jennifer 
Za k in the Triton Times office 
117 Blake Hall at Revelle. ' 

Murphy said he thought the 
college councils would reject this, 
because they wouIa rather appoint 
their own representatives. So far 

t~e councils have looked with 
disfavor on that provision. 

Murphy did not like the BOA to 
have powers of hiring and firing 
student affairs personnel and 
making final department policy. 

Yesterday the vic~hanceUor 
said he would accept a system in 
which BOA made policy for the 
student center, under his final veto 
power. 

That system was also advanced 
by Bookman, who said it was in use 
at UCLA. He added that in 12 years 
there the committee has only had 
one decision reversed by the ad-
ministration. -

Murphy also objected to In-
cluding representatives of the 
crafts center and the student info 
desk on the revised BOA. He said 
that such people would be sJUing on 
the board representi.ng employees 
of the board. 

"Their relationship to BOA 
would be 8S employees of the 
board," he said.

" Both on the grounds of 
desirability and lack of funding, 
UC San Diego faculty will have to 
pick up some of the load the T As 
are now carrying. It is much 
more desirable for un-
dergraduates to be exposed to 
faculty members than to 
teaching assistants. There are 
exceptions to that of course, but 
as a generalization it seems to be 
true." 

Avrum Stroll, faculty advisor 
to the Vice-chancellor of 
Academic Affairs Paul Saltmon, 
made that comment in a recent 
interview. 

Acting In effect as an associate 
vice-chancellor, Stroll finds 
himself helping 6albnan by 
replacing him when the vice-
chancellor is away. 

Stroll sees UCSD and the whole 
UC system as being in a period of 
very drastic change. The outlook 
is not bright as " the prospect of 
increased educational state 
support is very mall," c0m-
mented Stroll. In his opinion the

Th re ma be a considerabl 

amount of sacrifice in all levels of 
the university, including more 
teaching time put in by the 
faculty and, perhaps, a rejection 
of some students, he said. 

UCSD will also have to start re-
evaluating its use of TAs, said 
Stroll. " In my view, the teaching 
assistants are here primarily to 
learn to be professionals in their 
chosen field. Therefore, it is 
inadvi able to use them as 
teachers, as it interferes with 
their learning," he said. 

While some professions r.equire 
a certain amount of teaching 
experience, Stroll feels that the 
TAs must " be given very careful 
supervision on how to teach." 

UCSD should use faculty

said. Th r is more support b

<:;0 lition Needs Women for ERA Campaign 
Before th? all quarter ended, a 

group ol uest> women were able to 
hold an organizational meeting to 
establish the basis for feminist 
activism on campus. The Feminist 
Coalition met again last week to 
discuss more concretely the issues 

we want to face during the winter 
quarter. 

The upcoming ERA Convention 
in Los Angeles awakened in us the 
need for awareness at UCSD over 
what the ERA actually entails. 
Why is the ERA necessary for 

Hoehner Misses Humanity of 
Jesus in Analysis of Qumran 
. In his lecture on Jesus and the 
Qumran Conununity last Monday 
night, Dr. Harold Hoehner com-
pletely missed the great 
significance of the new knowledge 
concerning the milieu of Jesus' 
time as illuminated by the 
manuscripts known as the Dead 
Sea Scrolls. 

The questions he addressed are 
of tertiary importance and serve 
only to confuse those seeking the 
essence of the Qwnran findings. 
Whether Christianity is principally 
a modification of the Essene 
religion is mo'lt. 

In enwnerating 12 differences 
between Christianity and the 
Qumran community, Dr. Hoehmer 
ignores what many scholars 
maintain : that the Essenes may 
serve as part of a logical link 
between J udiasm and Christianity. 
Certainly, these discoveries do 
show that it is highly probable tha t 
a well-educated, intelligent, and 
especially innovative Jesus could 
have synthesized his teachings 
from the ideas common to his era, 
and done so as an apt response in 
his enviroment. Prior to the 
discovery of Qwnran, this con-
tention was not tenable from 
historical fact. 

The division between Judiasm 
and Christianity was perceived as 
arising from a quantum of 
revelation instantaneously con-
ceived. Such a situation obviously 
promotes the deity of Jesus as a 
competitive explanation. But the 
significance of the Qumran find-
ings is that rational explanations 
are encouraged and are plausible 
enough to eliminate the need for an 
irrational explanation . The 
complete humanity of J esus has 
never been clearer since his death. 

The facts and implications of the 
Qumran discoveries prove to be 
intriguing reading. I urge those 
interested in pursuing the truth 
about Qumran to consult the more 
than thirty books on the topic in the 
Central Library . 

Campus Crusade for Christ 
brought Dr. Hoehner to campus as 
the central figure in the series of 
lectures entitled, Jesus: Fact and 
Fallacy. He purports to convince 
us with reason that we ought to 
have faith in Jesus. This is an 
absurd undertaking, altogether 
precluded by a clash of definitions. 
Reason cannot prove fai th, for 

faith is a belief held that cannot be 
proven by reason. 

Soren Kierkegaard, the Danish 
theologian, states : "If I am 
capable of grasping God o~ 
jectively, I do not believe." Reason 
does not and cannot validate faith. 
Within the realm of reason, the 
only tenable stance on the diety of 
Jesus is neutrality. 

Dr. Heehner, if you_ want to 
believe in Jesus Christ, take your 
cue from Kierkegaard , and keep 
your belief and its substantiation 
out of the realm of reason.

"New Left" 
Spoils Teach-In 
With Outbursts 

I was deeply distressed at 
Tuesday night's Angola teach-in by 
the performances of numerous 
representatives of the " New Left." 
Not only did they try to destroy the 
efficacy of the teach-in by speaking 
out of turn and not respecting the 
decorum of the assembly, but they 
also harassed and treated with 
disrespect the members of the 
panel. 

I came to the teach-in for hopes 
in learning more about the political 
situation in Angola. Regardless of 
the views of the panelists , I 
nevertheless felt that they could 
provide the audience with su~ 
stantial information on the con-
flict. This opportunity for such 
dissipation of information was 
unfortunately vitiated by the rude 
outbursts of numerous members of 
the " New Left. " 

I am sympathetic to socialist 
ideologies. However, I'm finding it 
enormously difficult to take 
se riously any progressive 
movement, when J experience 
directly such a lack of human 
compassion, and dis regard (or 
mutual respect and individual 
freedom which these revolutionary 
students show. Indeed, I wonder 
how real and true to life their 
political visions are.

women? Although the proposed 
amendment hardly seems an in-
flamatory statement, the ERA has 
come under heavy attack from 
weU-olÂ·ganized forces ( right and 
left) . What are the arguments 
against the ERA? The Feminist 
Coalition, as do most women, feel a 
deepening drive to win equal 
rights. ~e understand that the 
ERA will grant women a formal, 
legal equality, but the struggle will 
not end there. We believe that the 
ERA is only a step toward full 
liberation - but is is an important 
and necessary one. 

The Feminist Coalition sees the 
ERA threatened. A need exists for 
the formation of a large-scale pro-
ERA campaign, even in the states 
where it has been ratified. "Stop 
ERA ," a national anti-ERA 
organization, has announced plans 
to push for " recession of the 
federal ERA in all states where it 
has been ratified." These threats-
and the facts that 2 states have 
already voted to rescind - mean 
that no state is safe. 

California is a strong potential 
target for anti-ERA groups (who 
are many times also linked to anti-
abortion, anti-union, racist 
ca mpaigns ). The Feminist 
Coalition has the potential to aid in 
the struggle for the ratification of 
the ERA. We need womanpower, 
and we need ideas. In addition, we 
need some of your time. We say, in 
our bicentennial " salute" , " 200 ' 
years is long enough! " 

All women are urged to come to 
the F eminist Coalition's next 
meeting, Wednesday, at 4 pm in 
the Women's Center. The ERA will 
not end womens oppression. The 
Â·active involvement of women in 
the s truggle to control ou r bodies 
and our lives is the only way our 
liberation wiIJ be realized. 

RONETTE YOUMANS 

Feminist 
Coalition 
Neglected 

I wonder why all the an-
nouncements and notices telling 
people about the formation and 
meeting of the Feminist Coalition 
were ignored by the Triton 
Times ... 

Education of all men and women 
on the ramifications of the Equal 
Rights Amendment (ERA) is an 
important issue for everyone. Why 
is the Triton Times refusing to 
support this education? 

There are important events 
coming up in the near future for 
people interested in the ERA. With 
your help, the word can reach 
more students and other readers of 
theTT. 

There will be weekly meetings in 
the Women's Center Â·at 4 pm 
Wednesdays for anyone interested Â· 
in learning more about ERA.

Angola-Another Vietnam? 
by Yvonne Hayes 

US involvement in the civil war 
now raging in Angola is the central 
international issue on the minds of 
the American people today . . The 
majority of the American people 
are worried-and justifiably so! 

" Is Angola to become another 
Vietnam?" 

Already the propagandists of the 
White House and the State 
Department are using the same 
well-orchestrated line to justify 
military intervention that they 
used in Vietnam in 1965. In the 
press and other media they cry 
about the threat of a "Communist 
take-over. " 

The American people have heard 
this line somewhere before. 

What Washington fails to "tell 
Americans is that the US has been 
secretly involved in Angola for 
many years. Ten years before the 
Angolan people beganÂ·their armed 
str\Jggle in 1961 to rid Uiemselves 
of Portuguese domination , 
Washington gave Portugal $298 
million in military aid. 

When the Angolan people began 
their fight for self-determination 
against the Portuguese im. 
perialists, Washington continued to 
pour in milita ry aid to the Por-
tuguese army. Portuguese olficers 
and troops were trained at 
American military installations; 
arms and heavy equipment, like 
helicopters and jets, were secretly 
funneled to the Portuguese army 
through NATO. This military 
equipment, provided behind the 
backs of the American people, was 
used by the Portuguese imÂ· 
perialists in the counter-
insurgency war of systematic 
terror that left tens of thousands of 
Angolans dead and much of the 
countryside ravaged. The CIA and 
other American intelligence 

Angola â¢â¢â¢ 
that Gann came "even though he 
knew that he would not be treated 
with the utmost cordially." 

Several members of the 
audience also leveled criticism at 
Laitin, accusing him, as resource 
person for debate participants, of 
failing to include a black African 
scholar on the panel and of not 
soliciting input from UCSD's 3rd 
college faculty. 

Laitin responded by stating he 
had made an earnest and sincere 
attempt to present a represen-
tative panel and that he did indeed 
seek the participation of the 
facu lty, Black Student Union and 
the Young Socialist Alliance. 

La itin said, "I assume full 
re.;ponsibility tor any gaps in the 
program." 

agencies have been actively ap-
plying their grab bag of " dirty 
tricks" in Angola - trying to play 
off one liberation group against 
another. There are numerous 
examples of this method in the 
FBI 's campaign to destroy the 
black liberation struggle in this 
country . 

Unlike what Ford and Kissinger 
would like the American people to 
believe, the real concern of the US 
is not a " Communisttakeover." On 
the contrary, what Washington 
fears most is the Angolan people 
"ta king over" mineral-rich Angola 
for themselves. For this reason, 
they materially supported the 
Portuguese imperialists against 
the Angolan freedom fighters for 15 
years, and, now that the Por-
tuguese are gone, they are at-
tempting to bleed and weaken the 
Angolan people by supporting two 
factions in a fratricidal civil war. 
Both Washington and Wall Street 
know that ,the continuation of this 
civil war will keep the Angolan 
people divided, and hence, weak. 

Wall Street's interests in Angola 
center on its natural resources. 
Angola is the third-largest coffee 
producer in the world. Diamond 
mines ownea by American and 
Portuguese firms produced more 
than two million carats in 1972 
alone, with an export value of $110 
million. Angola has huge deposits 
of iron ore, manganese, 
phosphates, copper, granite, 
marble, and asphalt. But most of 
aU, Angola has oil. Gulf Oll, with its 
concession in Cabinda, pumps out 
over 10 million barrels a year. 

Concern fOI the freedom and 
wellÂ·being of the Angolan people is 
the last thing on Ford's and 
Kissinger's minds. Profits, and 
profits alone, are what dictates the 
current war hysteria emanating 

from Washington. 
The danger of American military 

intervention, despite Kissinger's 
pledges to not commit troops, 
should not be underestimated. It is 
already known that Kissinger has 
allotted $33 million for the FNLA 
and UNITA, the two factions 
supported by the US. And Ford will 
be asking for an additional $150 
million! American mercenaries 
are being recruited to fight in 
Angola, and it has been reported 
thal American air units have been 
put on alert to ny air s trikes in 
support of South African troops, 
should the situation require it. 

What ties the hands of Ford, 
Kissinger and the whole military 
establishment is the unflagging 
opposition of the American people 
to any US involvement in Angola. 
The American people look on 
Washington's military maneuvers 
with great alarm. 

What is needed now is to build a 
protest movement based on the 
alarm and misgivings of the 
American people, and their 
healthy suspicion of the govern-
ment's intentions. A broad, united 
mass movement against any 
further US involvement in the 
affairs of the Angolan people would 
receive a positive response from 
the major-ity of the American 
people. It was the mass antiÂ·war 
sentiment of the American people 
and the numerous and massive 
anti-war demonstrations of the 60's 
and early 70's that prevented Ford 
from sending troops back into 
Vietnam when the puppet 
government was about to fall. The 
same potential exists for building 
and organizing protests against US 
involvement in Angola .

Oasis Needs Tutors; Credit Given 
The Office of Academic Support

(OASIS) urgently needs tutors for 
the winter and spring quarters. If 
an increase in tutors is not forth-
coming, "We might not be able to 
serve all of those in need," says 
Larry Hedges, assistant director. 

Hedges points out that there are 
financial and academic benefits in 
becoming a tutor. Tutors receive 
four units of upper division class 
credit during their first quarter in 
the program. In subsequent 
qua rters they earn $I5$).

The tutor shortage message 
counterbalances the good news 
that OASIS will add a new staff

The tlltllri ,tI prOl(ralll which 
covers lower-division math and

To receive a tutor, one should 
request to the OASIS office. Since it 
is three weeks into the quarter the 
available tutors have decreased 
dramatically, so it is imperative to 

make the request soon. 
Along wiUr the tutorial program,

Palmer's Sweet Soul 
by Steve Esmedina 

Staff Writer 
PRESSURE DROP. Robert Palmer. Island, 

Page five 

An indication of how black pop music is rapidly declining in quality 
since the advent of "disco" can be witnessed by noting the best soul 
albums of recent months : Average White Band's "Cut The Cake," 
" Kokomo," and Robert Palmer's "Sneakin' Sally 'Through The Alley" 
and " Pressure Drop." All of these records are by white Britons, and they 
all have what current manifestations of black pop lack : emotional depth. 

Palmer'S new album, " Pressure Drop" is probably the best of the 
bunch. Palmer has a very light, charming voice. Like early Todd 
Rundgren, he uses absolutely no b{ack innections, but is sweet, 
melodica lly precise, and very endearing after a few listenings. As a 
composer, Palmer is sort of a cross between Rundgren in his 
"Something/Anything" period and current Smokey Robinson. The 
album's two highlights, " Give Me An Inch" and " Back In My Arms" are 
airy, effective love songs with delicate string textures. 

Palmer's perennial backup musicians, Little Feat , are tight and 
propulsive. It would be interesting to hear how the addition of Palmer to 
Little Feat , America's best rock group, would arr~ct their music. It could 
very likely beef up what is a lready a major body of work. Whatever the 
case, " Pressure Drop" is an excellent minor album with a hell of a lot 
more soul than anything by Barry White. 
NORTHERN LIGHTS-SOUTHERN CROSS. The Band. Capitol. 

The Band is one of the two American rock groups (Little Feat is the 
other) that has managed to retain a lock on my interest. Despite the fact 
that they have wasted four years since their last studio album, 
"Cahoots," backing up the sclunuck with the whiny voice and idiot IjTics, 
they still have all the grandeur and swept majesty that they did on such 
great albums as " The Band" and " Cahoots." 

" Northern Lights-Southern Cross" brings them up to date with a bullet. 
It is as philosophically fundamental as " The Band," dealing with themes 
of American loneliness, nomadic freedom, and vagabond existentialism. 
MlL<;ically and emotionally it 's as intense and demanding as " Cahoots." 

The very real genius of The Band's work remains their astounding 
textures: - the contrast between terse, funk y guitar chops, loping bass, 
and umpteen varieties of keyboards; synthesizers, calliopes, Lowrey 
organs, and pianos. These all serve to keep the music swirling and en-
veloping. The Band never cease to amaze because of the excellence of 
their music works against their image as Dylan 's band. Compare the 
clanky, blase " Basement Tapes" with this album and see if your eyes 
don't roll with incredulity. It won't matter, of course , beca use" orthern 
Lights-Southern Cross- is a beautiful album, completedly realized, and it 
manages to totally belie its sou rces. 
ZUMA . Neil Young. Reprise. 

eil Young created two manic-<iepressant classics in the late 1960s 
"Neil Young" and " Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere." He followed 
those albums with his raggedyÂ·ann confections " After The Gold Rush" 
and " Harvest." After that his music became increasingly more formÂ· 
less, schizophrenic and de pres ing. Last year, " Tonight's The ight" 
won a g~ deal of critical acclaim because of its supposedly "searing" 
candoI' . The fa ct that it was ill-structured, melodically barren, and filled 
with woc-is-me readymades was rationalized as p ychoanalytic " art 
brut" by Young's most diehard admirers. 

" Zuma " is slightly more coherent. but it confirms Young 's totally 
wrongheaded conception of minimalist art. A declaration of depression is 
no more honest, forthright or evocative than the most bucolic John 
Denvel: lullaby. Young is simply a sentimentalist in reverse, inflicting 
his eonui on his listeners without the slightest semblance of wit or

Mal Mitchell hit eight of 14 shots, scored 20 points, had six rebounds 

and three assists in the loss of Azusa. Mark Dobransky had 13, and 
Tony Moore and Lyle Smith each put in 10, but the Tritons fell behind 
early and trailed 41-32 at the half. 

22 turnovers were the main reasoQ that the Tritons could only stay 
even through the second half, despite shooting well, and lost the game 
by nine .

Tubes ... 
The Tubes opened with "What 

Do You Want 'From Life" 
presenting the audience with its 
first taste of Fee, a man with a 
distinctly biselual manner , 
Another Tubes standard Is the 
starkly brutal "Mondo Bondage." 
Imagine Fee attired in a studded 
leather bondage outfit being 
whipped by his semi-nude lover in 
a fit of masochisUc ecstuy. Eat 
your heart out, John Denver. 

Fee did an excellent Tom Jomes 
imitation to " It's Not Unusual" 
which featured some interesting 
sexual theatrics with four lithe 
lovlies. It was followed by a 
patriotic salute to America that 
probably will not make President 
Ford's list of preferred bicen-
tennial themes. 

But the real kicker comeS during 
the finale when Fee becomes Quay 
Lewd, the English glitter rocker 
decked out in a feather boa and 
eighteen inch platform shoes. The 
Tubes then roared into the fremied 
number "White Punks On Dope" 
which turned their Halloween show 
at Winterland into I riot. 

Basically it was just a typical 
Tubes performance, if there is 
such a thing. But what a helluva lot , 
of {un it was. All one has to 
remember is. that this outrageously 
kinky show is done totally tongue in 
cheek. If you don't your bniin could 
be severely ravaged, and who 
knows? You might find yourself in 
the market for a black leather 
outfit with a whip and ...

TritonBasketbaIl: It's 
Nearly 'MUst Wm' Time 

By Dave Eisen 
Sports Editor 

The Triton basketball team is moving closer to a "must win" 
situation in the NAIA District 3 Southern Division. 

uam travels to Point Lorna tonight, to meet the Crusaders. With a 
victory, the Tritons (7-10, 0-2 in league) the Tritons' would find 
themselves ahead of Point Lorna (8-7,1-2 in league) in the conference 
standings. 

With a loss, UCSD would fall to the bottom in league play, with only a 
fading chance to make the NAJA play~fs. Cal Baptist (17-2, 2~ in 
league) has virtually been handed the conference championship, and 
it is likely that the second place finishers, along with Cal Baptist will 
be awarded play-off spots. 

The Tritons were stopped by Azusa Pacific, 7~9, Tuesday night, in 
a game that placed Azusa Pacific, along with Cal Baptist and USIU,

HYPNOSIS 

Tempe Rugby Club in the morning, 
and the Phoenix rugby Club in the 
afternoon. 

The Sirens lost a 1~ decision to 
much improved Temre, as UCSD 
was totally outplayed. Neither the 
Siren offense nor defense could get 
off the ground. 

The problems for UCSD were 
that the serum were unable to get 
the ball out of the backs, who in 
turn couldn't gain any yardage 
even when they had the ball. 

Coach Va-I Cardeiro and team 
pep leader Jeannie Cunningham 
gave the squad a talk after the 
match, that seemed 'to help the 
Sirens to a 10-0 win over Phoenix 
three hours later. 

Team work was the spark for 
UCSD, as inside center Sandy 
Timmon and wing Debbie Holstein 
were each able to score. Fullback 
Jan Riley made the second con-
version, for the final two points in 
the Siren win. 

Revelle, 
MuirHead 
For Finals 

by Jon Halperin 
Staff Writer 

The semi-finals of the UCSD 
Intercollegiate Basketball tour-
nament were held Tuesday in 
the main gym. In the opener, a 
poorly coached Fourth College 
team was soundly trounced by 
Muir College, and in the nightcap, 
Third College was dealt a stunning 
loss by Revelle . 

In the first game, Fourth got out 
to an early 6-2 lead. Then, Muir 
College, running an offense similar 
to the UCLA " Blitz", rattled off 
fifteen unanswered points to lead 
IH. Mike Brown, the game's 
leading scorer, with 13 points , hit a 
free throw to break the drought for 
Fourth. The score was 17-9 at the 
half. 

In the second half, Fourth pulled 
to within six points at 21-15. 
However, Muir led by Page Smith, 
outscored Fourth 11-2 in one 
stretch to put the game out of 
reach. The final score was 41-24, 
with Muir advancing to the finals . 

Muir was led by a balanced 
scoring attack, and a solid defense. 
Terri London, Ron Beard, and 
Scott Harkness headed the effort . 

Playing well for Fourth in a 
losing effort were Dave Eisen, 
Paul Trevino, and Raj Kapvny. 

In the second game, a poised and 
experienced Revelle College team 
ran away from talented 3rd 
College. 

Revelle jumped off to a 4-0 lead 
and never looked back. In fact, that 
was as close as Third was going to 
get all evening. Paced by Scott 
Creekmur and Paul Lebeau , 
Revelle pulled away to a 22-13 
halftime lead.

Surf, Surfing, Surfers 
" Eight foot, and there I was," he said emphaticallY'. " The most perfect 

waves I've ever ridden. JuSt these long glassy walls. And tubes. You 
shoulda seen me!" 

" Yeah. All right," I politely said , nodding my head. 

Surf. Surfing . Surfers. 
What the hell is it all a bout? 

â¢â¢â¢ 

â¢â¢â¢ 
The Santa Anas blew last week. It was very warm. The swell picked 

up . There were minus-tides in the afternoons. Black's was .. . weU, like 
only Black's can get. ~nd practicall~ everyone I talked to that got it, or 
thought that they got It, or Just saw It, or heard about it and wished that 
they had got it, most of them sOWlded rather pleased. " Stoked" was the 
word they usually used. 

â¢â¢â¢ 

The first time I visited my parents in Michigan after they had moved 
away from California, the son of one of their newÂ·found acquaintances 
asked me, " So you're a Soofer, huh? Get to hang around a lot of those 
foxy beach chicks, don ' t ya?" 

" Yeah," I answered to both questions. My folks tell theirfriends that I 
am, so I embarrassedly admit it to these people no matter how they say it 
and what it means to them. And it is easier to agree with that inevitable 
second questionÂ·assumption than to explain the contradiction, thus 
ruining the Image for them. 

â¢â¢â¢ 

Yes, the waves were very good. Just ask any of the guys at UCSD that 
look like they should know. 'nley will be happy to tel! you. 

â¢ â¢â¢ 

Guns (long, narrow surfboards that are for large waves) are ap-
parently the " in thing" right now. Regardless of ~unctiona lity . But there 
are swallow-tails, round tails, pin tails, butt tails, diamond tails, wings, 
Vee bottoms, flat bottoms, round bottoms, concave bottoms, hard rails 
soft rails, dol-fins, wide fins, two fins, short boards, thick boards, thi~ 
boards, eggs, fishes, and even bonzers. So who is to say which is right or 
best. Because everyone knows Nuuhiwa could ride even a door better 
than anybody else if he wanted to. 

â¢ â¢â¢ 

" How come you're not tan? You sure don't look like a surfer" she said 
disbelieveingly. ' 

" I'm not," I said, "I just suri. And, you see, it's the wetsult. " 
â¢â¢â¢ 

And, of course, it was crowded. Very crowded, although I have seen it 
worse. Two, three, four to a wave. The more the merrier? And each year 
the 1!umbers grow. And the hostilities. "I live here." " I've been surfing 
longer." " I surf better." "I've got inside position." So it 's My wave ! So 
fuck you ! So ~ere 's a board into your goddamned spine ! So ... 

â¢ â¢â¢ 

I am, always running into people that ask, " Do you still suri?" I guess 
they think it is something that you grow out oc. . 

" Yeah," I say tothem. 

â¢ â¢â¢ 
The sets were consistent. If a wave was caught by only one person he 

(Yes, he. She's are few and far between in the water.) usually rode it w'ell. 
Good waves make good surfers. But the very good surfers will always 

stand out. They did . 

â¢â¢â¢ 
What is surfing to you? 
" Surfing," he replied, " is the ultimate form of c06mic communication 

with mo~er nature. It is Art. Itis the purestConn ofseU expression . It is 
like maklllg love to a wonderiully sensuous woman. It is placing my 
polyurethane tool deep within Her life-giving womb. It is ..... 

" Blow it olit your ass," I said. 

â¢â¢â¢â¢ 

But dammit, there is something special about surfing . Despite the 
crowds, the inflated egos, the bull shit, the Surfers, and leashes, riding a 
w~ve, especially a good wave, whatever that is, can bring untold, inex-
pbcable pleasures to an individual. Certainly , it is not everything. It just 
sometimes seems like it.

P.petpt 

good as profÂ£ 
The assoc~ e vice-chancellor 

would like more faculty 
hired thus r d cing cl&ss sizes. 
He said CAPE reports show that Â· 
larger claSS()S show a tendency 
for down grarling professors. 

If the mat rial of the course is 
interdisciplinary the ratings fall 
even lower, Stroll said. " With 250 
students, 50 are captive. 

"No ~tter how exciting a 
professor makes the course there 
will be those who dislike it," he 
added. 

Outside Resources 
Another problem facing UCSD 

is resources. " After some in-
vestigation, I am more optimistic 
that I can get resources from 
outside sources than I was a 
month ago. . With carefully 
constructed proposals we might 
be able to find support to trans-
form the writing program on 
campus, add more post~octoral 
support for humanities students 
and more RA support for 
students," said Stroll. 

He hopes to come to a definitive 
answer regarding the resource 
problem within the next few 
months. 

Ratio Problem 
A serious problem regarding 

the graduate/undergraduate 
ratio is being dealt with by the 
Academic Affairs office, Stroll 
said. There are too few graduate 
students for the faculty at UCSD, 
according to Stroll. 

The problem, as he sees it, is 
that " High powered research 
faculty ideally ought to mostly be 
dealing with graduate students. 
These same people, .however, 
must be involved in teaching 
undergraduates. " The Vice-
chancellor's office works to 

Records ... 

harmonize the two diffetent 
poles, Stroll said. 

Stroll was appointed to his part 
time position last quarter to 
relieve Saltman of part of his 
workload. He feels another 
reason he was chosen was 
because at the time there were no 
representatives of the 
Humanities program in the 
administration. Since he had 
been at UCSD for 13 years and 
was one of the original founders 
of the Humanities program, 
Stroll was qualified for the job. 

Â·He has also had a variety of 
experiences on campus including 
presiding as head of the 
Academic Senate and as a 
department chajrman. 

Stroll presented views on 
various campus issues during the 
interview : 

-The Graduate Student Union 
(GSU ): " I think the GSU has 
some legitimate complaints. TAs 
in some cases were overburdened 
with teaching ... It may be just a 
matter of the faculty being more 
sensitive to the TA situation ... 

"I've heard that the GSU is 
trying to work-to-rule, that is 
work for only 20 hours a week as 
they are part time workers ... No 
one can correlate any academic 
activity to a certain number of 
hours ... 

"Work-to-rule is a mistake. If 
they (GSU members) argue that 
20 hours per week is a job, then 
departments could hire post-
doctorals for the same amount of 
money. 

"I don't think a TA is per-
forming this kind of job. They 
are backing themselves into this 
position. I hope the work-to-rule 
will disappear." . 

Stroll believes that there are 
plenty of post-doctorals who 
would work at UCSD. 

musical originality. If I wanted to heal' boring confessions I could have 
b come a priest. I don't ne d Neil Young to show me what I'm ~issing. 

THE TONY BENNETT -BILL EV ANS ALBUM. Fantasy. 

Personal tastes aside, Tony Bennett has always struck me as a brilliant 
singer. Until now, the thick, husky resonance of his voice has been 
wasted by syrup-filled collections of purposeless pop songs. Backed by 
Evan 's achingly romantic piano, Bennett's talents are given ample room 
to soar, and he uses the opportunity well. Particularly beautiful are the 
sedately sentimental " Waltz For Debby" and the chillingly austere " My 
Foolish Heart ." A fine, off the beaten track collection by two superb 
traditionalists.

Strike Always "Bad" 
-An indefinite GSU strike: "A 

strike is always bad. Again, the 
GSU is using the industrial 
model. An ordinary ' industrial 
worker is not given an education. 

"The strike does not hurt the 
administration. We are not 
selling any product. Withholding 
serviN'.'J affects only students. ' 

-CIA recruitment on campus: 
"The fact is that the CIA has not 
recruited on campus since 1969 ... 
I thought the resolution 
proposed by the Academic Senate 
was peculiar." 

The resolution called for 
complete disclosure and term-
ination of all CIA activity at 
lJC. Stroll felt that there was no 
CIA activity on campus, there 
was no need for the second half of 
the resolution. "The issue was 
presented on campus as if you 
objected to the resolution you 
were for the CIA." 

-Freshmen living on campus: 
" Freshmen should not be 
required to live on campus, but 
it's a good idea." 

-Tuition: "I have always been 
opposed to any tuition... Every 
citizen should be supplied the 
opportunity to gain the maximum 
edu~ation he can grapple with. 
The state should be interested in 
providing this education in its 
own interests .. . Tuition prohibits 
minorities from going on in 
education... The state ought to 
tax to raise the money." 

Stroll commented that it was 
unfair to require parents of 
college students to pay both taxes 
to support the colleg.es and 
tuition. 

Revelle, Muir .... 
. In the second half, Revelle 
resumed its crisp-passing 
perimeter offense and continually 
burned Third with good outside 
shots. Third managed to pull 
within five points twice during the 
second half, but the calm, com-
posed Revelle :squad would let 
them get no closer. With the game 
getting out of reach, the Third 
College bench started harrassing 
the referees. The officials had 
made some questionable calls, but 
they did not affect the outcome. 

Playing well for Third were 
Larry Collins, Ken Stockstill and 
Tim Hayne. 

The finals will pit a strong Muir 
team against a solid Revelle 
squad. The game will take place 
February 14, before the UCSD-
Azusa Pacific varsity matchup. 

Ledurer 
H. Gobind Khorana, considered 

one of the pioneers in elucidating 
and determining the elements of 
the genetic code, will be the 1976 
Calbiochem-UC San Diego 
Foundation lecturer, January 26-27 
and February 2-3, at UCSD. 

Khorana, Alfred P. Sloan 
Professor of Biology and 
Chemistry at the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology, has suc-
ceeded in chemically synthesizing 
an entire gene, a laboratory ac-
complishment which opens the 
<loor to study of outstanding 
problems in molecular biology_ 

Khorana is the third lecturer in 
the series which began in 1974. 
Previous lecturers were Frank H. 
Westheimer of Harvard University 
(1974) and Edward Anders, of the 
University of Chicago (1975). 

A distinguishing feature of the 
lecture series is that it bestows the 
equivalent of a visiting 
professorship on the lecturer who 
remains on the UCSD campus for 
two weeks to consult and meet with 
colleagues and students. 

All four lecturers will take place 
at 4 p.m. in room 2622 of the 
Undergraduate Sciences Building 
on the Revelle campus. 

Regents 
Out of the fourteen meetings of 

the UC Regents scheduled for the 
1976-77 academic year, only three 
will be held on UC Campuses. 

The three campus sites chosen 
are UC Davis, UC Los Angeles and 
UC San Francisco. 

Other meeting locations will 
alternate between the Los Angeles 
Convention Center and the San 
Francisco Extension Center. The 
first meeting is set for February 
19-20 at the Los Angeles Convention 
Center. 

Award 
Stanford S. Penner, UC San 

Diego Professor of Engineering 
Physics and Director of the Energy 
Center, has been selected to 
receive the G. Edward Pendray 
Award from the American 
Ins~tute of Aeronautics and 
Astronautics AlA A for 1976. 

Given annually to "an individual 
who has made an outstanding 
contribution or contributions to 
aeronautical and astronautical 
literature in the relatively recent 
past," the award will be presented 
during the AIAA 12th annual 
meet ing next Thursday, in 

Friday, J â¢â¢â¢ .,. II, It71 

Washington, OC. 
The award is being presented to 

Penner for his "outstanding 
contributions to the literature of 
aerothermo chemistry and its 
application to combustion theory 
radiative heat transfer and re: 
entry phenomena." The Pendray 
award consists of a certificate of 
appreciation, an honorariwn and 
an inscril>ed desk clock. 

PeMer came to UCSD in 1964 as 
professor and first chairman of the 
Department of Aerospace and 
Mechanical Engineering Sciences, 
after serving on the faculty of the 
California Institute of Technology 
for 14 years. 

In 1968 he was named director of 
UCSD's Institute for Pure and 
Applied Physical Sciences, and 
served as Vice Chancellor of 
Academic Affairs during the 1968-
69 academic year before returning 
to teaching and research. 

Since 1972 he has been respon-
sible for the development of 
energy-related programs and 
courses on the San Diego campus.
