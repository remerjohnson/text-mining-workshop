At the out et of the c1as ,which 
deals with the Vietnam War and 
its impact on American ociety, 
Professor Walter apps announ-
ced, "We ha e a major problem 
here today," in reference to ire 
MarshallJohn Kennedy' reque t 
that the hall's ai Ie be cleared of 
students who were unable to find 
seats. 

"We will not be able to proceed 
with class today unless ever one 
is properly eated," apps said. 

Approximately 17 student were 
either tanding or ' itting in the 
aisles when the class began , which 
had abo been the ca c at the pre-
vious week ' class meetings. There 
were, however, empty seat on the 
first day of class.

$1 ,766, while nonre ident 'fees will 
go up to $7,565. The current 1988-

Fee hikes had been ex pected in

the U niver ity of California re-

He added that in addition to 
the rise in tudent fees, other 
financial maneuvering involving 
UC operating and retirement 
fund would be necessary to allow 
the University to continue func-
tioning in the coming year.

The calls, all to female undergraduates living 
on campu , are suspected to have been made by 
the same white male. Garcia aid . 

He aid that all the victim ' reported hearing 
the same type of voice and being "a ked the same 
questions." 

The caller appparently kept the women on the 
phone by threatenting bodily injury if they hung 
up. 

Although Garcia believes that the e are "ju ·t 
hollow threa t ." he did uggest that anyone 
receiving one ..... all th police right away." 

.. fhe police \o\ill come [to the victim's home] 
and if the guy i ' ' erious about comi ng... ome-

This fact indicated to Garcia that although the 

victim were concerned, they were "not too 
bothered by [the call ]." 

He added, though, that ictim hould call the 
police right away. He said that people who com-
mit violent crime ometimes tart with mailer 
crime. such a annoying phone call. "That' our 
concern." he admitted. 

Garcia uggested that the best wa to deal with 
an ob cene phone call i "jll t to hang up if [the 
caller] get lewd ." 

He aid that the u pect "gets gratification 
from people itting and Ii tening." and that if the 
victim hang up, "a go d per entage of the time 
the caller would never call back ." 

Garcia did ay that if the call i a one time 
incident, it i ver hard for th poh e t do any-
thing about it. 

However, he added that if the calls become a 
recurring anno ance, "then it' more reali tic to 
do ~oll1ething about it."

he ~aid that the poli e would like to hear about

UCSB Gets Videotaped Lectures 
for Overenrolled Art History 

ANTA BARBARA - Bearing the brunt of over-
enrollment at UCSB, more than 500 students will 
have to settle for videotaped lectures of Art History 
6B this quarter if they intend to take the much 
demanded class. 

The decision to offer the video replays of Professor 
Larr Ayers' morning lecture, a practice accepted 
occasionally for highly impacted c1as e , came when 
more than 1,500 students enrolled for the cour e held 
in the 525- ' eat I la Vista Theatre I . Campbell Hall, 
the largest available class space with 860 seats, was 
unavailable becau e it was already booked. 

A primary rea on for high demand for the cla sis 
that art history courses have become a popular alter-
native to Western Civilization cour es for fulfilli ng 
general education requirements. However. unlike sur-
vey history courses which can be taught by a number 
of faculty members from the hi tory department , art 
history urvey courses are taught by only a few 
instructors because they are "more of a specialty 
area." said UC B As ociate Dean of Student. David 
Kohl. 

To help the large number of students benefit more 
from the c1as , 15 additional ection and even extra 
teaching assistants were added to the original schedule 
so there would be a chance for students to discuss the 
subject on a more intimate level.

CROWDING: Causes Problems 
Continued from pile I 
dents late to class gradually came 
in and assumed positions on the 
aisle floor . 

The professor aid the problem 
came about largely because he 
had been informed by the UCSB 
Regi trar's office in early January 
that the pre-enrollment level wa 
at 860 and he would be allowed to 
add up to 40 more students. 

He said he then igned 35 add· 
petitions on the first day of class, 
noting that those petitioners all 
had seats that day, only to find 
out later that the 860 figure was 
incorrect and the current level 
had-swelled to 930. Capps said he 

regularly over-enroll the class 
with the expectation thaI there 
will be absentees . 

Students were asked during 
class to consider whether this 
quarter would be the only oppor-
tunity they would have to lake the 
class before they. left UCSB, and, 
if not , consider dropping it as a 
gesture to those who may be gra-
duating this year. Letters and 
Science Assistanl Dean David 
Kohl said his "gut feeli ng" is that 
class members will comply with 
this request and added he is aware 
of at least eight students who have 
dropped for these reasons. 

In addition to the students en-

rolled in the class, Capps said 
there are an unknown number of 
Vietnam veterans and auditors 
who attend the class on a given 
day for varying rea ons. 

From now on, the veterans 
and, if necessary. students, will be 
asked to be seated 'on the stage 
during class in order to resolve the 
problem. 

Senior Elizabeth Irving posed 
another possible reason for the 
overcrowded situation, saying that 
even though there might be a few 
scattered empty eats, "some 
people aren't real aggressive a bout 
climbing over people to get to a 
seat in the middle of an aisle." 

PROFESSOR: ShimkinAmong First 
To Link Smoking, DES To Cancer 
Continued from pale 1 
of the UCSD Medical School in 
1969. 

,Dr. Sh im kin's career was 
devoted to explaining the myster-
ies of cancer through ground· 
breaking laboratory research and 
vital popUlation studies. "I was 
impressed with his knowledge and 
approach to the cancer problem," 
said Dr. Clifford Grobstein, pro-
fessor emeritus of biologica I 
science and public policy. 

Shimkin was noted for his 
research in linking substances, 
such as tobacco and the drug die-
thylstilbestrol (DES), to various 
forms of cancer. 

His studies in the 1950s were 
among the first to link smoking 
and lung cancer. "In 1957, he 
advised the NCI that there was a 
definite link between cigarettes 
and cancer, but it took seven 
years before the Surgeon Gener-
al's report came out [reiterating 
that same fact]," Petrakis said. 
The Surgeon General' report is 
un;versally credited with report-
ing the link. 

"He was concerned that [many] 
years after his discovery, the U.S. 
government was continuing to 
su bsidize tobacco," added Dr. 
Cedric Garland, associate profes-
sor of community and family 
medicine at the UCSD Medical 
School. "He thought that the 
government's priorities weren't 
correctly assigned." 

Another of his early projects 

linked DES, given to some preg-
nant women to prevent problems 
during their pregnancies, to the 
high rate of uterine cancer found 
in those women's female children. 

In his research, Shimkin showed 
that the offspring of animals given 
DES developed cancer. ~He took 
this as a warning sign for humans 

Dr. Michael B. Shimkin 

and his predictions were eventu-
ally proved to be true," said 
Shimkin's co-worker, Dr. Deb-
orah Winguard. 

"Unfortunately, de pite his re-
search, DES was used for about 
30 more years before production 
stopped." Winguard continued. 
"He was testifying in lawsuits

mothers sued the drug compan-
ies) until a couple of years ago, 
sta ting that because animal re-
search was available that should 
have been enough to realize the 
danger to humans . He made a 
real contribution." 

Shim kin was very interested in 
informing the public about the 
latest cancer news. "He had a real 
commitment to making sure the 
public had the right information," 
said Leslie Franz of the Public 
Affairs Office of the UCSD Medi-
cal School. 

Shimkin also researched the 
behavioral variables of cancer 
victims. " He believed that the 
publicdoes not clearly understand 
what is harmful and what is not 
with regard to cancer," said Gar-
land. " He tried to empha ize the 
importance of major factors such 
as smoki ng, drinking, and diet 
over concerns about trace chemi-
cals linked to cancer." 

Shimkin, a prolific writer, has 
more that 300 publications to his 
credit. His books cover the his-
tory of cancer and cancer research 
from ancient times to the present, 
and are regarded as classic works. 
However. according to Petraki , 
Shimkin never accepted royalties 
from hi books. 

Shimkin contributed to thl! 
Journal of the National Cancer 
InstitUleand also served as an edi-
tor of Cancer Research, "the most

Typical Bureaucracy 
Pa smg the buc k is standard procedure in bureaucracies, and 

UCS D is no exception. The action (or lack of it) the University 
ha taken on the engineering department's GPA di crepancy 
demon trates the truth of thi tatement. 

everal month ago, A.S . tudent Advocate Bard-Alan Fin-
Ian discovered an incon istency in the grade policy of the engi-
neering department. Pre-engineering students who had failed a 
cia 5, then repeated it, had their original grade and their ubse-
quent grade averaged into their G P A when they were considered 
for entry into the major. Thi computat ion procedure is in 
violation of Academic Senate regulations. 

Instead of rectifying the problem, the University has chosen to 
ignore it. The University has ruled that the grade calcu lation 
procedure may remain as is, but that it can no longer be called a 
"G PA" computation. It seem a though the names have been 
changed to protect the guilty. 

The u e of thi ' tactic i unfortunate. More unfortunate, 
though, is the way the problem ha been shuffled from commit-
tee to committee. It is unfair for a student who knows the 
material well enough to get an 'A' to be penali z.ed because it was 
the student's second time through the course. 

The UCSD Committee on Educational Policy should quit 
playing bureaucratic games, a nd deal with this problem. 

HUD Gets a Big 'L' 
At first glance, putting con ervative darling Jack Kemp at 

H ousing and Urban Development seems like some kind of cruel 
joke. I n 't this the man who was one of the chief cheerleader of 
su pply-side economics in Congress? Didn't the" Reagan tax cut" 
start life as the Kemp-Roth bill? 

But there is rea on for hope. Be njami n Hooks, executive 
director of the NAAC P, said Kem p was a " Big-L" Liberal on 
issues of hou ing and civil rights . At the press confe~ence where 
Bush announced Kemp's nomination, Kemp said that the 
budget must not be balanced on the backs of the poor. H e made 
clear his concern for the homeless. 

Best of all, perhaps, was the ambivalence with which his 
nomination was greeted by the ew R ight. They fear that H ooks 
may be right , and we may embark on a new (albeit limited) war 
on poverty. Just having a big name at H UD helps . 

Hopefully, the ignorance and apathy the R eagan administra-
tion showed toward poverty, homelessness and urban problem 
will not be carried over into the Bush administration.

A.S. Wastes 
Money 
Editor: 

The Associated Students of 
UCSD and Programming Com-
missioner Jonathan J udaken have 
messed up again! Two total wastes 
of money came to my attention at 
about the same time: feminist 
speaker Sonia Johnson and social-
ist peaker Phillip Agee. 

The A.S . spent $2,500 to allow 
Sonia Johnson to speak on our 
cam pus, a nd $1,750 on Ph illip 
Agee. T his upsets me because 
part of my fees contributed to 
these peop le's pocketbooks, a nd 
I'm sure not many tudents were 
intere ted in hearing these spea k-
ers anyway. 

Accord ing to the Dec. I 
Guardian , ProgrammingCommi -
sioner J onathan J udaken pointed 
out that 48 percent of our student 
body is women and said that the 
A.S . should "support a large por-
tion of our campus." This seems 
to say that all the women on 
campus are feminists or would 
like to hear a feminist speaker. I 

5H~-

doubt that a majority of women 
on cam pus are interested in a 
"radical, militant , ex- Mormon," 
as Johnson was described in 
Alternative Visions. 

I am a woman, but not a 
feminist, and I am actually 
offended by some of the views of 
feminists. Although I will admit 
that a slight majority of students 
on cam pus are leaning towards 
liberalism, 1 doubt that many 
would describe themselves as 
"revolutionary socialists" like 
Phillip Agee did, according to the 
California Review. 

The December issue described 
Agee as an ex-CIA agent and 
founder of Counter Spy magazine, 

, which printed the names, home 
addresses, and phone numbers of 
CIA agents across the world . 
Shortly after this informa tion was 
printed in a newspaper in Athens, 
the CIA station chief was brutally 
murdered by a Greek leftist. 

I am astounded that this man 
was even allowed to speak here -
and then we paid him ! This is 
outrageous and a total waste of 
money. I have yet to see the A.S. 
support a conservative speaker. If 
Judaken and the A.S. want to 
"support a large portion of our 
ca mpus," let them support some 
less radical , even conservative, 
speakers.

Said Lecture 
One-Sided 
Editor: 

Mr. Said claims that he is inter-
ested in bringing about a better 
understanding of the Middle East 
situ ation, and that he is working 
towards peace. In light of this, 
and the fact that Mr. Said is a 
respected professor at Columbia 
University, I wonder why Mr. 
Said failed to confront some very 
good questions posed from the 
audience during his lecture here 
last week. Is Mr. Said serious 
about bringing a better under-
standing of the situation, and 
working towards peace, as he says 
he is? Why then did he reJuse to 
answer the following questions 
during his lecture: 

1. Vasser Arafat expresses his 
new commitment to a "side by 
side" peace plan with the state of 
Israel and a Palestinian state. But 
Mr. Arafat's principal deputy, 
Abu Iyad, is quoted in a Kuwa iti 
newspaper (Dec. (8) as saying, 
"To our people we will say; at fir t 
a small state, and with Allah's 
help, it will be made large and 
ex pand to the east, to the west, 
and to the north a nd so uth . I am 
interested in the liberation of 
Palestine, step by step." Pal~sti-

All U.S. Citizens Are Equally American 

By LARA MlHATA 
Managing Editor 

Box 

I just want others to realize that being 
Asian does not mean you're not 
American. 

Through my experiences I have found 
there exist misconceptions about the dif-
ference between ethnicity and cultural 
conviction. 

When I moved into A-House (Tenaya 
Hall) my fir t year at Muir, I was 
informed it was part of an experimental 
"Cultural House" - a program designed 
to transcend cultural barriers and unite 
diver e individuals. 

This situation, coupled with an expo-
sure to several different ethnicities in my 
uite alone, fueled an increasing aware-

ness of my own ethmcity. 

Participation in Cultural House was 
supposed to be voluntary. I didn't appre-
ciate being placed there without consent, 
just because I was Asian . 

I was raised among very few Asians. 
When I was in elementary school I was 
teased about being Japanese - many 
children ridiculed my physical character-
istics. 

Of course there were generalizations. 
When antagonized or harassed it was 
certain that someone would warn the 
offender that I knew karate. (Naturally 
someone of my descent would know 
karate.) 

Not knowing how to respond , I 
internalized any anger or frustration I 
felt. It wasn't until reaching UCS D and 
the Cultural House experience that 1 was 
able to place all of this in perspective . 

There are many people in society who 
still believe that one\ character can be 
judged on the basis of appearance alone. 

Just two weeks ago I was offended 
several times by a 'friend of a friend' with 
whom I had just been acquainted. After 
telling him my friends and I had gone OUt 
for Chinese food, he told me he didn't 
care for it himself. "But I'm sure you do," 
he said to me. 

I responded by telling him I'm not 
Chinese. Ten minutes later he asked me, 
"Lara, did your uncle fly one of those 
during the war?" He was referring to a 
model airplane hanging from the ceiling 
in the bar. It had red dots on the wings 
and tail. I was surprised and just said no. 
I had just about had it when he asked me 
if I knew a Glen someone (he had a 
Japanese last name) . Amiably I asked, 
.. How would I know him?""Oh," he aid , 
"he' Japanese, too." I couldn 't help but 
show my fru tration, so I tactfully told 
my friends that I wa~ tired and left. 

Thi~ ex perience wa~ an ex treme ca~e. 
Usually my bru he with presumption 
are harmless encounters by those who 

speak to me in Japanese, assuming that I 
know the language. 

Last quarter a man who approached 
me at the Pub spoke to me in Japanese 
and seemed literally appalled that I didn't 
undentand him. "What an: you, second 
pncration? Do your parenu speak it?" 
he asked. "No," I said amiably, "they 
don't." I told him J was fifth generation. 
He wu very lurprised. 

The last time I dropped off my rent I 
told a man there that my roommate 
would probably be in the next day with 
her, after she returned from Taiwan. 
.. Are you from Taiwan, too?" he asked. I 
answered no and walked out. 

The re ult of my experiences have been 
hurt feeling , fru~tration, and a general 
feeling of skeptiCism. I'm disappointed 
every time my ethnicity is singled out , and 
wonder when society will ri~e above it 
ignorance and rcalile that all U.S. citi-
lens are equally American. 

The UC D Guardian 

Lecture 
Continued from page 4 
nian National Council chairman 
Ada AI-Kamid Sayah, declared 
(Dec. 21) "the liberation of Pales-
tine must be the aim of all of us. 
We must take , and ask for more, 
without concess ion. We are act-
ing to acquire what is possible in 
this stage, and will demand more 
afterwards." How do these state-
ments, made by Arafat's clo e col-
leagues, reconcile with Arafat's 
pledge to recognize the state of 
Israel, and to live with it "side by 
side?" 

2. Article nine of the Palesti-
nian National Covenant claims 
that armed struggle is the only 
way to liberate Palestine. Does 
this not preclude any negotiated 

peace or compromise with Israel?' 
The covenant has been changed 
with ease several times in the past. 
If the intentions towards peace on 
behalf of the PLOare more than a 
smoke screen designed to appease 
Western audiences, and in partic-
ular, the United States, why has 
the charter not been changed? 

3. From Vasser Arafat , who 
says he renounced terrorism, 
comes this response to a We t 
Bank truce appeal by Bethlehem 
Mayor Elias Freij: (Washington 
Post , Jan. 7. 1989)" Any Palestin-
ian leader who proposes an end to 
the intifada (uprising) exposes him-
self to the bullets of hi own 
people, and endangers his life. 
The PLO will know how to deal 
with him." Immediately Mayor 
Freij backtracked and went into 
hiding. How can you reconcile 

OPINION 
the peaceful words of Arafat with 
such harrowing threats against 
his own people? 

4. If you were an Israeli would 
you feel secure going back to a 
seven-mile width in the narrowest 
part of Israel? Is this consistent 
with security, keeping in mind 
that not only will Israel border the 
proposed Palestinian state. but it 
will still be surrounded by the big 
five armed Arab nations (Syria, 
Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia)? 

Mr. Said's refu al to answer 
these, and many other pertinent 
questions, shows only the one-
sided ness of his appeal. Even more 
revealing is Mr. Said's failure to 
recognize Israel's valid security 
needs - showing a lack of serious-
ness in his proposals. As a profes-
so r, Mr. Said should be concerned ' 
with bringing about better under-

standing of this situation rather 
than with alienating people by 
refusing to answer their questions. 

Furthermore, why have certain 
faculty member uddenly come 
out in upport of the Palestinian 
people? Where were these same 
professors back in 1967? Why 
have they taken so long to address 
this longstanding issue? One possi-
bility might be a trend in academia 
(especially true at UCSD) to 
sympathize with Third World 
revolutionary move ments. But 
this trend toward sympathy with 
the T hird World is misplaced . 

No trend can substitute for the 
dialogue, discussion, and better 
understanding - understanding 
0/ both sides oj the issue, that is 
necessary for any resolution of 
the Palestinian situation.

Solution to 
Reg Lines 
Editor: 

The other day I had a memora-
ble experience shared with several 
thousand other UCSD students 
this quarter - I added classes at 
the Registrar's office . More spe-
cifically, I waited in line to add 
classes at the Registrar's office. 
An utter waste of several thou-
sand person-hours that could eas-
ily be alleviated by the application 
of a little rational thought. 

Party Flyer's Effect Was Inappropriate, Exploitative 

Myoid school (Virginia Tech, 
if anyone's interested) had a si m-
ilar, and even worse, problem 
when I first got there. But several 
years ago the registrars there made 
a simple, inex pensive change that 
reduced the average waiting 
period to about five minutes: they 
handed out numbers. Then they 
posted a "Now serving ... "sign (a 
portable blackboard would do) 
and anybody whose number was 
at or below the number on the 
sign went straight in; those whose 
numbers were just above it stood 
in line for a few minutes, while 
those whose numbers obviously 
wouldn't come up for hours were 
free to go about their other busi-
ness (e.g. standing in li ne at the 
Cashier's office, or the Bookstore). 

EdItor: 
Under tbe title "Paranoia, 

Not Sexism," you .,ublished a 
letter from freshman John Sotter 
(Guardian, Jan. 17). In it, he 
claims that paranoia is a more 
serious problem on campus than 
sexism, While paranoia may in-
deed be a problem, Mr. Sotter 
is mistaken in his view of the 
issue. 

The party Oyer in question 
(which, like Mr. Sotter, I did 
not see) was perhaps distrib-
uttd for the sole purpose of 
publicizing the party, but it was 

·not designed with that as its 
sole purpose. The flyer, which 
apparently upset at least one 

individual, was no doubt 
desiptd to entice people to 
come to the party with the 
notion that the women at the 
party would be like those de-
picted on the flyer, thus assur-
ing the party-goer a "good 
time." This is clearly a sexist 
ploy used often in all facets of 
advertising, from flyers such as 
this all the way to the profes-
sional level. As such, it is a 
medium unfortunately accept-
able to certain groups within 
society. 

Mr. Satter is mistaken in believ-
ing that this view of the flyer is 
an over-analysis of the situa-
tion. It is just such small and 

seemingly inconsequential in-
cidencea of sexism that must be 
addrased, if inroads are to be 
made at all in the broader issue. 
In answer to the questions he 
(rhetorically) poses: parties ad-
vertised in such a manner need 
not be chaperoned by the police 
(that is quite a reaction-
ary response, Mr. Sotter). 

Perhaps, though. some guide-
lines could be set and enforced 
as to the appropriateness of 
such advertising in a university 
setting. If that is not possible, 
the only recourse an individual 
has is to boycott the party him 
Qr her self. If enough people 
were to react in such a manner, 

maybe that type of advertising 
would decrease, in favor of one 
that is more egalitarian and less 
exploitative of women. 

Mr. Sotter says that although 
he is a freshman, he knows 
"enough about party flyers to 
know that ~hey are not created 
for the purpose of making wom-
en look like the 'lesser sex '." He 
is correct. That is not the pur-
pose; but that is the effect. 

Inthefmalanalysis,suchadver- . 
tising only perpetuates society'S 
degradation of women, and 
should have no pla;e in an 
institution of higher learning. 

Many. Sue ChyUnskl 

If anybody in a ca mpus admi-
nistrative office is reading this , I 
ask you to give a moment of 
thought to so imple and easy a 
way of improving the lives of so 
many st udents. 

If this bit of common sense 
were. against all odds, to be 
adopted at UCSD, maybe we 
could go on and figure out what 
in the world a reg. form is for!

Said Lecture Accurate and Excellent 
Editor: 

I went and heard Dr. Edward 
Said's lecture at Mandeville 
Auditorium on Wednesday, Jan. 
19. In my opinion, it is about 
time we had educated speakeT 
on this campus di cus ing the 
vital issues in the Middle East. 

It is about time we had some-
one gi ve us a good per pective 
on the Middle East , especially 
on the issue of the Palestinians' 
quest for peace - they don't 
want to die by the hundreds. In 
light of the recent pTogress that 
Vasser Arafat ha made by 
renouncing terrorism and ac-
cepting resolutions 242 and 338. 
we shou ld all realize that he i 
seriou about peace and that he 
doe n't want any more of hi 
people 10 be shot a t. killed or 
imprisoned. 

Said's lecture entitled "The 
Palestinian Proposal for Peace" 

It's Simple ... 

wa one of excellence and accu-
racy. It is about time someone 
spoke in such a way as to offset 
the biased Teporting that the 
United States use when deal-
ing 'with the Palestinian issue. 

If we believe that all men 
were created equal, than what 
gives the United States the right 
to dehumanize the Palestinians? 
They are human beings and 
have the same inheTent rights to 
autonomy and to determine 
theiT own future . The Palestini-
ans are struggling fOT theiT sur-
vival again t the military might 
of ISTael, the sixth strongest 
nation in the world . 

The people of Palestine are 
trying 10 defend themselves 
fTom occupation by using any 
mean they can. Thi includes 
throwing rocks because that is 
their only available means Tight 

now. I n the West Bank and 
Gaza Strip, Palestinians cannot 
caTry any type o f weapon and 
even the colors of their flag are 
outlawed. Anyone carrying a 
flag. even without throwing any-
thing, can be arrested and 
impTi oned in already over-
crowded jails, since about 5,000 
people have been arrested. 

The restrictions on the 
Pale tinian living in the West 
Bank are so monumentous and 
unbearable and have been going 
on for over 21 years that it is no 
wonder that there is an uprising 
rebellion called the Intifada. 

The Israelis can't pull the 
wool over our eyes forever. 
Sooner or later the truth comes 
out and in the Middle East, the 
truth is that Israel is stalling the 
solutions and progress towards 
peace.

RESEARCH GRANTS 
;n Iberia and Latin A mer;ca 

With funding from the Tinker Foundation and UCSD. the Center for 
Iber ian and Latin American Studies will be awarding $25.000 in 
researc h grants for fieldwork to be conducted in Latin America or 
Iberia for 4-10 weeks between June. 1989 and February 1990. 

The purpose is to expand ca~pus expertise. research. and 
contacts In these regions. 

The Center encourages applications from all graduate students al 
any pre-dissertatIon level and junior faculty (Instructors and 
ASSIstant Profe~sors). The competit ion is open to all disciplines and 
departments With Or Without a strong Latin American or Iberian

Irreplaceable Inspiration to Others

world," according to Rotkin. 

H is personal traits were lauded 
by his fTiends, co-workeTs, and 
family. " His major characteristic 
was his humanity. He was a 
generous, compassionate person 
who never forgot that OUT objec-
ti ve is minimizing suffering as 
weU as advancing undeTstanding," 
Garland said. 

"H is strong sense of values and 
concern for social issues per-
meated his interactions with his 
peers and co-woTkers," added Dr. 
Ruth Covell, the associate dean 
of planning at the UCSD Medical 
School. 

"He was a humanist who treated 
his patients with compassion," 
stated his daughter Ann Segal.

Continued from p.le I 

Although theTe is no way to 
know exact ly how the suspect got 
the victims' numbeTs, Garcia 
mentioned that UCSD's EDNA 
information centeT does "give tel-
ephone numbers out quite read-
ily." 

Hesaid that while EDNA serves 
a valua ble purpose, their policy of 
divulging telephone numbers is a 
"weak point" of theiT system. 

"If you don't want your name 
to be given out to just anyone, 
you should be able to do that," he 
said . 

Marianne Homsey of EDNA 
said that the information center's 
policy is to give telephone num-
beTS to anyone who asks. 

However, she also mentioned 
that "If a person calls up and says 
they don't want to be listed [in 
EON A 's directory], we put a note 
by theiT name and wo n't give [the 
number] out."

His treatment of patients was 
gTeatly influenced by his World 
War II experiences. she added. 

" He was a doctor in Patton's 
third aTmy during World WaT II 
and treated the still-survivi ng 
people they found during the Iib-
eTatio n of the concentTat ion 
camps." 

According to Segal, he des-
cribed what he saw as "the most 
inhuman man can be to man." 

Segal also noted that Shim~in 
"helped an awful lot of doctors 
come along. " 

"He was an inspiration to me 
and many otheTs. especially 
younger people getting into the 
field," Rotkin stated. 

"He had faith in my work and 
helped me to continue with it [as 

well as] encouraging other re-
searchers." Petrakis added. "He 
was a key person in the start of my 
career and I couldn 't have done it 
without him." 

Shimkin accumulated many 
prestigious degTees. honoTs, and 
awards throughout his career. 
including the first Distinguished 
Achievement A ward presented by 
the American Society of Preven-
tive Oncology. 

" He also Teceived the highest 
honor given by one's peers in 
canceT research when he was 
elected president of the American 
Association for Cancer Research," 
Rotk in said. 

"Hewas[ofJa rare breed . There 
is probably no one who can re-
place him," Garland concluded.

Greeks Expand Amidst Cheers and Jeers 
EdilOr 's nOTe: Th is is the first 

of a fWo-part look at f raternities 
and sororiTies at L'CSD. Parr two 
will appear in the Jan. 26 issue of 
the Guard ian. 

By MARLA SC HN EIDM AN 
Contribu ting W"ter 

T he word cIrcul ated a rou nd 
UC D the e days which 'eem to 
a rouse the most diver e sent iment 
among t he administration and 
the student body i the word 
"Greek." For some people, images 
o("Animal Hou e"cometo mind, 
while for other, the Greek repre-
sent a welcome relief to what is 
often een as a tagnant ocial life 
here at UCSD. 

One thing is true nationwide: 
going Gree k is back in style. The 
fraternities and ororit ie are 
goi ng stro ng a nd growing rapidly 
as one quarter ends and the next 
begins. 

"There is a definite interest in 
t he Greek system," aid Tracy 
Emper, president of Pan hellenic 
a nd mem ber of the Alpha O mi-
cron Pi sorority. "The Greek sys-
tem seems to be a popular route 
to take because of tradition which 
is api>ealing, especially for those 
students whose parents were in-
volved and because of the social 
outlet it provides in such an in-
te nse academic environment." 

Though fraternities a nd sorori-
ties are an excellent source fo r 
social grou p interact ion, not 
everyone is invited to participate 
in these organizat ions. 

When a student decides to get 
involved with a fra ternity or a 
sorority, he or she must engage in 
a process known as "rush." T his 
usua lly lasts fo r about a week and 
ma y involve diggi ng up fi ne attire, 
polis hing up o n social skills, inter-
acting with members of the group 
in a part icular selling, laying your 
character out on the line, or re-
moving yourself from your true 
identity in order to impress those 
who have succeeded in rushing 
the years before. Of course, 
anyone can rush, but in the end it 
is a select group of rushees who 
are chosen to carry on the tradi-
tions of their founders. 

"During rush, we are looking 
for a person who will contribute 
to the fratern ity and who will be 
able to get along with the rest of 
the mem bers," said Curtis Bow-
den, president of the I nterfrater-
nal Council at UCSD. 

" We do give each prospective 
member careful consideration be-
fore we make our final decision," 
he added. 

Sororities a re also loo king for 
so meone who has leadership po-

tent ial and who i~ mot ivated a nd 
enthu~ ia t ic. "Cont rary to pop-
ular belief, we try to gi e every girl 
the same pos ibilities during ru ' h. 
A pretty face isn't a utomatically 
goi ng to do the trick." Emper 
sa id. 

Although the Greeks feel that 
the method of selection is fair . 
many people are not comfortable 
with the y tern as a whole. "The 
election proce s i actually very 

political," said a founding father 
o f one fratermty on cam pus wh o 
wishes to remai n anonymous. 

"There are several factors which 
taint the ' ru h' process:' he aid. 
Immediate co nsideration is given 
to those who have "legacy." This 
means that if a rushee's re lative 
was involved with a fra tern ity or 
sorority at o ne time or another, 
he o r she is usually given high 
p riori ty for mem ber hip. Also, if a 
p rospe.ct ive member has a fr iend 
in the house, he or she wi ll u ually 
ge t specia l considerat ion. Fina lly, 
when a rushee's acting job is cap-
able of transforming hi (or her) 
personalit ,judgi ng people fai r ly 
seems next to impossi ble, he ex-
plai ned. 

hi feel as if the selection process 
strips an ind ividual's self identity 
away as that perso n is t ry ing so 
ha rd to be accepted into a certain 
group of people." said La ni Car-
ver, employee at the General Store 
Co-op. 

"I wouldn 't even consider rush-
ing a sorority becau e I j ust 
wouldn't feel as though 1 could be 
myself. I would have to act a cer-
tain way to give off j ust the right 
impression, which would ulti-
mately make me wort hy ofaccep-
ta nce," she sa id. 

Some people fail to realize that 
there is a mutual selection process 
ta king place. "At the same time 
we are decid ing which girls we 
think will fit into our sorority, the 
rushees are also choosing a house 
where they feel most comforta-
ble," Emper said . 

Since the members do reject 
people whom they don't think 
will fit in with their group, there is . 
a tendency for people to think of 
these organizations as elitists and 
exclusionary. "I was walking in 
the Student Center one day while 
rush was going on next to some 
other girls who were all handed 
fliers on rushing sororities. I was 
the only one who didn't receive a 
flyer," said Lisa Cauble, a volun-
teer at the Women's Resource 
Center. " I believe that my image 
didn't match up to the image that 
they had in mind. Their value sys-
tem is different. It's a white upper 
middle class system." 

"The presumption that we are 
elitist and exclusiona ry is not at

all the ca e, " Bowden said. ~On 
some campuses being Greek is a 
statu symbol but at UC SD this is 
not nece sarily the case." 

As one student noticed , "At 
UC D, it doesn't say much here. 
Anyone ca n be a Greek or not a 
Greek - it doesn 't make a differ-
ence," said Rob Geller, a non-
Greek phy ic major. 

Just how d ifferent is the Greek 
system at UCSD as compared to 
those at other schools? 

One belief is that the intense 
academ ic enviro nment at UCSD 
doesn 't a llow for the " Animal 
Hou e" mentality. "The Greek 
System at UCSD is a super group 
of people," said Todd Bittner, 
leadership development coordi-
nator a nd student advisor. "The 
quarter sys tem just doesn't allow 
the time to mess around . Mostly, 
Greeks at UCSD take their aca-
demic endeavors very seriously. 
In fact, every group has a specific 
GPA requirement." 

Another factor which sets 
UCSD Greeks apart is the lack of 
on-campus housing available for 
the members . "We have had to go 
out into the community in order to 
throw parties or meet in large 
groups," Bowden said. "Unfortu-
nately, there were complaints from 
the neighbors so we stopped throw-
ing parties in the community. 
There is also the problem of drink-
ing and driving. The liability is 
just too great." 

The administration has no plans 
to grant Greeks housing in the near 
future, so all of those people who 
do not want to see the develop-
ment of a Greek Row at UCSD 
can sit back and relax . 

"If any group gets priority for 
on-campus housing, it will be the 
individual colleges," said Chips 
Dreilinger, Dean of Muir College.

-----------.. 

Bittner feels that the adminis-
tration doesn't consider Greeks a 
high-priority group of people. 
"The Greeks on this campus do 
not have special privileges by any 
means," Bittner said . "The Uni-
versity recognizes sororities and 
fraternities as student organiza-
tionsjust like other student groups 

such as the che s club." 

Although the University might 
grant all organizations the same 
status, the organizations don't op-
enite on the same levels. Most 
University organizations don 't 
have a selection process nor do

Greeks 
Continued from page 8 
they require quarterly fees. as the 
Greeks do. 

Another unique aspect of the 
Greek system at UCSD is the fact 
that it is so new. The oldest soror-
ity is II years old and the oldest 
fraternity i not even ix year old. 

"What people seem to forget is 
that UCSD's Greek system ha 
no real foundation ." Bowden said . 
"UCSD was born in the '60s dur-
ing the anti-establishment year 
so it doesn't have the tradition 
associated with the much older 

fraternities and sororities on man 
American university campu e . It 
will take many years before UCSD 
become another UCLA or 
Berkeley," Bittner said. 

Some of UCSD's Greeks seem 
to be a tame bunch, they feel they 
are continuously misjudged due 
to the image of the Greek system 
at nearby an Diego tate Uni-
versity. "Many of the Greeks at 
San Diego State de erve the rep-
utation they have acquired. The 
semester system allows them more 
time to mess around, which many 
certainly do," said Bittner, who 
used to teach at San Diego State 
University. "What happens is that 
the negative images a sociated 
with the Greeks at State get car-

FEATURES 
ried over 10 UC D. [UCSD 
Greeks] don't deserve the negative 
publicity they so often receive." 

At UCSD, only 10 percent of 
the student body participate in 
the Greek sy tern. "At another 
college I was familiar with on the 
East Coast , 60 percent of the stu-
dent body was Greek. There was a 
lot of Jiscrimination," Dreilinger 
said . "The frats presented so 
many problems, such as heavy 
drinking and trashing facilities . I 
haven't seen that here yet." 

"I've attended three different 
universities and I've encountered 
more anti-Greek sentiment here 
at UCSD," ;aid Kay Ryon, mem-
ber ofTri Delta, the newest soror-
ity on ca'mpu , and judicial chair

for Third College Council. "The 
images people have of our group 
is simply a stereotype formulated 
by people who don't care to find 
out more," she aid. 

Some people point out that the 
Greeks provide resources for com-
munity activity. "No tudent or-
ga~ization gives so much man-
power and money to a specific 
cau e as the Greeks do," Bowden 
said "Each chapter donate mon-
ey to a special cause every year." 

As a result of negative pu blic-
ity, the Greeks are working to 
change their image through a 
heavy public relations campaign 
"Fraternities and sororities are 
more than just a social outlet," 
Bittner said . "These groups offer 

The UCSD Guardian 

a valuable lea'rning experience for 
the people who join. You learn 
leadership skills as well as inter-
per onal skills. These a re often 
skills that you just don't pick up in 
a classroom setting." 

Some members rely on the 
Greek system for a strong sup-
port network. "When times are . 
tough, it is nice to have people 
around you who you can always 
count on for support," Bowden 
said. 

" It's nice to know that there are 
always a group of guys I can caU 
up when I feel like going out. It 
makes living off campus less alie-
nating," said Danny Shector, spe-
cial events chairperson for the 
Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity .

STUDENTS DENOUNCE PROPOSED 
FEE INCREASE!!! 

(Sacramento) The Univcrslly of Califom1a Student AssoclaUon today 
denounced the Governor's proposed 10% Increase In student fees for 
1989-90 as a "scrlous departure from the state's student fee poliey." 
accordign to Racey WoodrulT. UCSA PreSident and a graduate student In 
bloenglneertng at UC San Francisco, 

The State's student fee policy (Chapter 1523 of the Statutues of 
1985) provides that student fees at the University 0 fcalifornla dn the 
CalifOrnia Slate University are to be set according to a methodology based 
on previous budget Increases. For 1989-90. the fee-setting fonnula caned 
for a 3% Increase In University of CaUfom1a fees, 

"In recent good budget years. we have accepted fee Increases 
called for by the fonnula," said WoodrulT. "and we expect the state to keep 
Its end of the bargain by adhertng to the fonnularln this bad budget year, 
Before the studentfee polley law was enacted. wewould have seve rIa years 
without a fee Increase and then one ot two years oflarge fee Increases like 
this one. The fee poliey law was supposed to provtde Instead for small. 
regular Increascs that are disengaged from the pollUcsand pressure ofthe 
state budget process. The governoe has regened on the deal." 

WoodruJI expressed concern that the extraordinary Increase wtll 
further restrtct access to already-squeezed low and middle-income stu· 
dents. 'WhUe some finanCial aid dollars wUl be allocated to olTselt the 
elTects of the $144 Increase. financial aid resources are already inade-
quate to meet the needs of Callfornta's p;)()rest students. and many 
students receive no finanCial aid at all. We hope that the legislature w!ll 
restore the fee tncrease to 3% as called for by state law." FOR MORE INFO.

Continued from page 16 
for both Kirby and the women' 
team. "Last year we had more 
early season meets and people 
had already qualified by this time. 
It's been frustrating, but this is the 
start of it now," Kirby said. 

Meanwhile, divers took to the 
boards for the second round of 
competition and UCSD continued 
to excel. Prange dove into fir t 

place in the 3-meter competition 
with a score of 362,48, and her 
performance also earned her a 
trip to ationals, 

The men's team remained 
strong and finished in the top two 
positions with olid diving from 
o good and Cas erly on the 3-
meter board, 

"One down, three more to go," 
said a pleased Tom Scotty, the 
diving coach, Although cotty 
felt the scores could have been a 
bit higher, he i confident that 
with consistent practice and addi-
tional meets, t he team will put it 
all together. "We'll be there come 
March!" Scotty pointed out 
assuredly, 

Even though C D opted to 
scratch swimmer from events and 

SPORTS 
swam the last events "unofficial-
ly," the final score left Pomona-
Pit zer virtually at the starting 
block. The Triton women pound-
ed their opponents 155-78, while 
the men added to the beating by a 
165-90 score. 

ext week. however, UCSD 
will not hav!; it so easy. The Tri-
tons travel to Las Vegas for the 
UN LV Rebel CIa. sic on Jan. 27-
29 to wim against top Division I 
school . "This meet will be as fas t 
as the Division III Nationals, so 
we'll be able to watch how we do 
under pressure," Head Coach Bill 
Morgan mentioned. 

With the fast pace Morgan 
antlclpate next weekend, the 
Tritons will be pushed even 
harder. Thi boo t shou ld put 

wimmers close to the time cuts 
over the top, and will po ibly 
add more names to the ro ter for 

ationals.

ers get experience against thi 
level of play," second-seeded (on 
the UCSD team) Sig Huber said. 
Huber lost his singles match 6-3, 
6-1 to Ro bert Sonern. 

Huber and Galloway are the 
fifth-ranked doubles team in the 
nation (in Division III ), and 
Huber is ranked 25th in the nation 
in si ngles. 

Huber, who was not disap-

The l/ CS D Guardian 

pointed with the day ' results, 
sa id that playi ng against such tiff 
competition "gets that mental 
mtenslty up," and added "[I] was 
basically pretty happy with the 
way 1 played." 

Fifth-seeded Tim Ditzler wa 
the only T riton to win a set, tak-
ing Ralph Kunzler the distance 
before going down 6-3, 6-7, 6-3. 

" It takes a while to get match-
tough, ~ Huber reflected after-
wards. "As the season progresses, 
we expect to get mentally ready. I 
think we're definite contenders 
for the national championship."

Triton Rugby Destroys U C Irvine 
By JONCA RLO MARK 
raff Wrirer 

The CSD rugby team emerged 
aturday afternoon eager to begin 

league play. After three month 
of pre ea on work which included 
tournaments nearby in Ocean ide 
and a far away as Hou ton, the 
Tritons were read to defend their 

two-time league championship 
status. 

O n the other hand, longtime 
rival U Ir ine stood a a tough 
foe for U SD in this opening 
game. The Anteater had t he 
opportunity to be the first team to 
knock off th e the defe nding 
champ, who had compiled a 14-1 
record in two year of outhern 
Cal i f ornia Collegiate League 

Steve Swirling fights for ground In the Tritons' win over IrVine 

action. 
However, Irvine's attempt 

stood to no avail a the Tritons 
routed Anteaters , 3 J -15. 

CSD built up a 19-0 lead 
after one half a tries were pro-
duced by winger Ja on Morrison, 
outside center Dan chmid, and 
lock Pete Christian en. In addi-
tion, Eric Ta keuc hi converted two 
extra point kick and Poodle 

civoletto hit a three-point penalty 
kick all in the fir t half. 

At the same t ime, much of the 
credit for the win mu t be given to 
the Triton "pack" the forwards 

who were able to co ntro l the 
larger Irvine pack. Up front, good 
efforts, especially in t he fles h 
rucking situation , were provided 
by Andy Christia nsen. 

The Tritons played well in the 
second half as Troll Lefkoff and 
Adria n Mansbridge each s o red 
tries a nd John Tellenbach made 
good o n two extra point kicks. 

"One of the three tough tea ms 
is behind us." sta ted Head oach 
Tom Butler. " Irvi ne was bigger,
