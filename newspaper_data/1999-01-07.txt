High School 
Students Try 
Out UCSD 
SCHOOL: Early Admissions 
Honors program allows seniors 
to enroll in college classes 
By KJ.Mln Sung 
Senior Staff Writer 

UCSD is giving local high ~dHx) 1 ,enion, 
a taste of college life through the Early 
Admis,ions Honor, program (EAH), which 
permits 60 highly qualified high school , tu-
dent, each year to enroll in UCSD c1a"e, 
during their senior year in high ,choo!. 

Acceptance to EA H abo gUJrantee, , tu-
dents admis,ion to UCSD. after high sc hool 
graduation. High school juniors from San 
Diego County arc curn!l1tly ~lIh1l1illil1 g 
application, for EA H. 

"EAH i, helping top cahher , tUtkl1h 
excel , while providing the opportunity for 
them tll take courses that are not offered at 
their high school." sait! EAH coordinator 
Patricia Reiswig. 

Applicants arc ranked according to their 
individual combined academic index score. 
which based on GPA and SAT. I or PSAT 
scores. The top 60 studcnts will qualify j()r 
EAH. There is a limit of 15 students per 
high school. 

''The provision is no more than 15 stu-
dents from anyone area because it gives dis-
trihution for other schools in the area to he 
included," Reiswig said. "This way, stu-
dents from one particular school do not take 
all the positions." 

Applicants must have a GPA of at lea,t 
4.00 in all high school courses applicahle to 
UC admissions requirements. The students 
must have S.A.T. I or PSAT scores of at least 
620 on the verbal test and 560 on the math. 

EAH students receive university-level 
credit for classes taken through the program. 
Grades become a permanent part of the stu-
dent's academic record, as with any other 
currently enrolled UCSD student. 

EAH students may take up to two cours-
es per quarter at a cost of less than one-third 
of the usual matriculation fees . However. 
students must pay an application fcc of $40, 
a registration fee of $400 per quarter. the 
cost of hooks and supplies at $50 to $80 per 
course, and for a $91 parking permit. 

"Some of the students are already al such 
a high level of potential that they set the 
curve here for the classes, but they tend not 
to self-identify themselves as high school 
students," Reiswig said. 

Reiswig also added that EAH students 
blend in well with other UCSD students due 
to their level of maturity and academic 
excellence. 

Amanda Johnson, a senior at Mira Mesa 
high school, is a participant in the EAH pro-
gram. While juggling a schedule of AP 
classes and marching/concert band, Johnson

BRIEFLY ••• 

Physicists Study Superconductors 
A team of physicists led by UCSD scientists has 

taken a major step forward in the evolvi~ story of 
superconductors. Superconductors are materials that 
have no resistance to electricity. They conserve ener-
gy and money, especially when compared to currently-
used metallic wires. 

Superconductors are normally created by lowering 
metals to several hundred degrees below zero 
Fahrenheit. However, 12 years ago, "high tempera-
ture ' superconductors were discovered and thought 
to be of more practical use because the metals did 
not have to be cooled to such an extreme tempera-
ture. High temperature superconductors are complex, 
inter metallic compounds based on the oxide of copper 
called cuprates. 

The team, which includes Dimitri Basov, Robert 
Dynes and other colleagues, analyzed the properties 
of cuprates using state-of-the-art spectroscopic instru-
mentation developed at UCSD. As reported in the Jan. 
1 issue of the journal Science, the research team doc-
umented an anomalously broad energy scale associ-
ated with the cuprates as they made the transition to 
superconductorS. 

"One of the things I think this specific paper illus-
trates is that our conventional ww-j of thinking about 
metals doesn't work: said Dynes, a phYSics profes-
sor and UCSD chancellor. "So this clearly tells us that 
we have to think of new ww-js to describe all these 
properties. We can't just use extensions of concepts 
we've developed over the past 50 years.· 

Basov hopes that by pinpointing the mechanisms 
responsible for high-temperature superconductivity, 
researchers may be able to develop new materials for 
specific purposes, including satellite communications 
and other areas.

TAs, Administration Must 
Remain Open and Flexible 

Last quarter 's academic chaos, brought about by 
the UC teaching assistants (TAs) strike, calmed for a 
moment on Dec. 7 after both the UC administration 
and the Association of Student Employees/United 
Auto Workers entered into a 45-day "cooling-off' 
period. Currently. the administration and the union, 
which is still unrecognized by the University of 
California, are meeting in an effort to resolve this 15-
year-old conflict. . . . 

This period of discuss ion , facilitated by Callfornta 
legislators John Burton and Antonio Villaraigosa, is a 
positive step toward the resolution of this issue. The 
effort s of these legis lators are to be commended. If 
used constructive ly, the coo ling-off period and sub-
~equent dialogue can be the first step in developing a 
solution that is beneficial to the entire UC communi-
ty. 

Now that the Public Employment Relations Board 
has ruled in favor of the TAs (a decision for which the 
university has been waiting), we hope that the 
University of California will not drag its feet in the 
discussion process . 

Only if both parties engage open ly and flexibly in 
the dialogue can any resolulion be reached. If not, 
students may find themse lve~ without TAs - a cri ti -
cal element to undergraduate education - after the 
cooling-off period ends on Jan . 20. Undergraduales 
may <Igain find themse/ve~ caughl in Ihe middle of 
academic chaos. 

Buying Power of Students 
Should Lower Book Prices 

This week, students from all majors rushed li .<e 
lemmings to the UCSD Bookstore only to find the 
prices of books are sti II exorbitantly high . 

Until recently, the bookstore has had little or no 
competition. Now. with the Co-op bookstore carrying 
even more books and the number of online book-
stores increasing, it is puzzling why anyone would 
wait in the UCSD Bookstore's long lines only to pay 
top dollar for their texts. 

To keep students from using their purchasing 
power elsewhere, the UCSD Bookstore must stay 
competitive. Online sites such as www.bigwords.com 
offer books at lower prices and have no shipping 
costs to Californians for nonnal delivery. while other 
on-campus and local bookstores typically have better 
prices. 

The UCSD Bookstore, with its prime location and 
convenience, should cater to its student market by 
lowering prices to competitive. levels.

PRICE OF ACADEMIC 
SUCCESS Is No FUN AT ALL 

COMMENTARY: 
Striving for excellence, 
UCSD students often 
forget the meaning of fun 
By Jenna Barclay 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

It 's Ihat nagging voice in Ihe back 
of your mind, Ihal feeling you can't 
qui Ie define; iI 'S a sense of emplincss 
and longing, as if you have missed out 
on something imponanl, somethi~g 
Ihat you deserved. Thcn it hits you. 
After four years of suffocating erudi-
tion and many finals laler, Ihal inde-
scribable lacking comes 10 a head. 

Squished into a room full of drunk-
en college students, strange and wild 
creatures, whom you wonder how on 
earth ever pass lheir exams, you sud-
denly lind yourself submerged into an 
inebrialed whirlpool of frivolous. 
thoughtless. unproductive ". some-
Ihing. You grapple for lhalthree-Ieller 
word so entrenched in your childhood 
memories thaI describes this feeling. 
FUN. You find yourself having FUN. 

This phenomenon is a rare occur-
rence al UCSD. II is no sccret Ihat the 
social life here is slack. The only 
reprieve after a week of loilsome class 
is Ihe hope of venluring 15 miles down 
some jam-packed freeway in search of 

~ome vague party you heard so-and-so 
lelling someone else ahoul. You arc 
praying you will not have 10 h~ Ihe 
~oher driver lonight, as you and a car 
load of your favorite friends make a 
mad dash to Ihi~ anomalous evenl in

Alas, you show up al Ihe vulgar 
hour of 10:30 p.m. reali7.ing Ihal you 
are 100 late. The music was jusl too 
loud for Ihe ~ofHempered neighbors. 
Dejecled and still sober, the lot of you

anolher weekend slips by, the remain-

A slacking social life lends per-

it, we all complain about it but 
nobody seems to know what to do

reach. UCSD has cleverly conlitruct-
ed itself as a painfully asocial envi-

one-track-minded student enroute to 
the library. 

UCSD's very entrance rolls out like 
one of those royal carpets you see in 
fairy tales, ushering subjects into the 
imperial jaws of that insect-like mon-
strosity we call a library. That magnif-
icent beast, perehed upon its royal 
mound with a relentless reminder to 
study, study. sludy, is but one example 
of our campus's bizarre decor. In bol-
slering Ihe poslerity of radical archi-
tccture, UCSD does not provide an 
inviling or cozy almosphere for its stu-
dents. 

Ralher, this almospherc is almost 
foreboding and its dcccntrali7.ed archi-
teclural sprawl hreaks up any hope for 
demographic conlinuily. Comparing 
Ihe Price Ccnter's boistcrous Punky 
Brewsler-likc mini mall facade, 
Warren 's concrete austerity and Muir's 
GOlhic-like dominion, onc will gain 
some insighl into the lifc of a UCSD 
student. 

The separateness of UCSD's five 
colleges forces students to identify 
with their own 1.'Ollege rather than with 
the campus at large. And this only luts

6 OPINION 

FUN: 
Students are entitled 
to a social life 
ContInued frOlll ..... 4 
unti I the end of freshmen or 
sophomore year. In the Olympics, 
athletes are purposefully separat-
ed from each othcr to maintain 
focus and promote antagonism. 
Such stratagcm goes right along 
with UCSO 's intent to drive itself 
into the top UC position. 

The dry-campus codes force 
us to vent our pent-up studying 
energies elsewhere. and yet the 
community around us is entirely 
unsympathetic to student needs 
and life-styles. Alas, we are con-
demned to the outskirts of 
Pacific Beach or Mission Beach. 
In addition. with the quarter sys-
tem we barely have time to 
breathe as we are constantly 
bombarded with papers, 
midterms and finals. 

As students, we arc obligated 
to study, but we are also entitled 
to a bit of a social life. The way in 
which UCSO has dried. decen-
tralized and filled itself with con-
stant academic requirements ha~ 
seriously deprived us of this right. 
Further, our lack of a football 

• • 

team and the absence of any sig-
nificant controversy deprives us 
of the fuel for school spirit. We 
can safely say that UCSO is the 
most contained of all the UC cam-
puses. 

Understandably, UCSD wants 
to move itself up in the rank of the 
UC system, but it can not do this ' 
by focusing solely on academics 
and undernourishing other aspects 
of student life. We, as students, 
work hard, study hard and need 
some sort of stimulation or dis-
traction outside the occasional TA 
revolt or poster sale. Surrounded 
by a community unsympathetic to 
our interests we need a school in 
which we can vent our energy 
after a hard day of studying. 

Granted there are a few such 
events. particularly ncar the 
Hump, but the layout of the cam-
pu~ and the demands of classes 
keep a lot of these events in hid-
ing. The irregularity of UCSO 's 
architecture and the isolation of its 
colleges preclude any sort of ea~i­
Iy accessed, centralized student 
forum in which 10 diffuse knowl-
edge. energy and school spirit. It 
seems as if this campus was pur-
posely segmented to prevent 
cohesion of the student body - a 
paranoid thought.

The UCSD Guardian 

At the very least, the irregular-
ity and isolation have prevented 
us from implementing more effec-
tive means by which to increase 
the social life of the school. With 
the dry-campus codes, sterile 
morale, imposing architecture and 
majestic library looming over us, 
our campus has become a stifling-
ly potent academic environment 
from which we desperately want 
to escape at the end of the day. 

Students do not connect their 
social life to UCSD. Even when 
there arr. events, attendance is 
gener.llly pretty low. Students are 
forced to go elsewhere in search 
of FUN, some traveling great dis-
tances and others submitting to 
the school's intense academic 
demands, forgetting the whole 
meaning of the word. 

So, 'Perhaps, UCSD will 
achicve that top UC ranking yct. . 
It has III ready demonstrated 
marked improvement in the last 
two years alone. However, if 
UCSO continues to progress aca-
demically at the expense of all 
other aspects of student life, we 
wi II be assured a very du II stu-
dent body and a very Ii feless 
campus.

year. In the end, after spending a 
great deal of time and resources 
on an attack, the United Slates 
will have to face the same prob-
lem this time next year, if not 
sooner. 

The cyclical nature of such a 
foreign policy is disturbing. 

Even with his military capabili-
ties temporarily hurt, Hussein's 
development of both chemical and 
biological weapons continues in 
laboratories throughout Iraq. The 
United States could not get rid of 
these laboralories because Hussein 
has hidden them where no one, not 
even UNSCOM inspectors, could 
lind them. 

Hussein's elite Republican 
National Guard, which protects the 
Iraqi president from harm, could 
not be targeted in the strike because 
it had been moved to heavily civil-
ian areas, where the United States 
would not send missiles and 
bombs. 

The question in this dilemma 
becomes: When will it end'! What 
IS the Ilyswatter that will squash 

Thursday,lanuary 7, 1999 

this gnal once and for all'! After 
Operation Desert Fox, Iraq's mili-
tary capabilities were degraded 
only by a year. The weapons of 
mass destruction are still being pro-
duced, the Iraqi National Guard 
still proteclS Hussein, and the Iraqi 
leader is no weaker politically 
inside nor outside his country. 

Many fear that our policy 
toward Iraq is of the same vein as 
our policy loward Vietnam during 
the Vietnam War. How many more 
times will we have to attack Iraq 
before tlk~re is a significant change 
in the situation'! Every time we 
attack Iraq, we strain -our relation-
ship with allies such as Russia, 
China and France. 

The United States must formu-
lale a foreign policy that will 
weaken Hussein's grip on power, 
making the Iraqi people think 
twice before supporting their pres-
ident. In addition, that policy must 
provide for a way to hurt 
Hussein's ability to produce 
weapons of mass destruction. 
However, the formulation of such 
a policy js much easier said than 
done as proven by the futility of 
the UNSCOM inspections and 
Operation Desert Fox.

Stomp brings unbridled 

perCUSSion to the San 

Diego Civic Theatre 

• 

'

rom the misty recesses of man's 
primordial past and into tbe dim 
light of a modem city selling, 
Stomp delivers a contagious beat. 
This multi-award winning and 
internationally touring show, cre-

ated by Luke Cresswell and Steve McNi-
cholas, proves that tribal rhythms sti II stir 
within everyone and everything - even in the 
junkyard. At the San Diego Civic Theatre, 
through Jan. 10, eight uninhibited, playful and 
extremely talented performers will demon-
strate how mops and trash cans can provide 
endless entertainment. 

Almost everything can be used to make 
music. Sweeping, coughing and applauding 
create a unique, though often unrecognized, 
rhythm. This underlying theme comes through 
brilliantly as Stomp explores the percussive 
possibilities of the most common . objects, 
resulting in ingenious clanging, banging, 
clicking, clapping and stomping ~pectacles . In 
addition to skill. the nearly two-hours of ~kits 
ofTer enough humor to make people notice the 
rhythm of their laughter. (Ha, ha ... ha, ha. ha 

... ha, ha ... ha, ha, ha .... ) Broken broomsticks 
are taken in stride, as foolishness is all part of 
the fun. But no one on stage ever misses a 
beat. 

No words are spoken throughout the per-
formance, yet every stomper's style shines as 
they play their parts in the chaos. One charac-
ter enjoys sl!\JlPing his belly for a strong efl'e(;t, 
another prefers imitating a large and bewil-
dered bird, while yet another doesn 't really 
like to put too much effort into performing at 
all. One very clap-happy soloist encourages 
the audience to panicipate throughout the per-
formance, though clapping and snapping with 
such speed and dexterity is difficult for the 
average ticket holder. Regardless of talent, 
though, everyone claps and stomps their way 
back to the parking lot after the show. 

And, more than likely, everyone who sees 
Stomp comes back the next season for more. 
Not only is this Stomp's lifth season playing to 
sell-out crowds, but the company that is now 
perlorming in San Diego is only one of two 
concurrent national tours. A third company has

FRESH BEER AND FINE FOOD 
New restaurant, Gordon Biersch, begins to brew in San Diego 
By Undsay Sworskl 
Hiatus Editor 

Dan Gurdon and Dean Bier~ch 
ar.: the kind of guys you'd want to 
have as drinking huddic~ . Tht:y're

own a hre\\'~ ry. 

So ~tJtcs a ~Il\all hrOl:hure

Ing the we~t coast. Gordon Biersch. 
Dan Gordon . on~ of Amt:rica\ 
kading hrewing engin..:t:rs. and 
Dean Bicr~ch , sea~oned restaura-
t.:ur and heer lover. got together 
one day and talked about husines~ 
over a few cold ones. Now. over 10 

year~ and 10 restaurant-openings 
later. Gordon Biersch 1m, found a 
home in San Diego's Mission Val-
ley. 

"We have always considered 
thb market to he a great match for 
Gordon Biersch. and arc unheliev-
ahly excited ahout joining the San 
Diego community." Biersch stated. 
''The company was built on the 
idea that food. heel' and fun is life's 
be~t comhination. and we think a 

life~tyle community like San Diego 
can truly appreciate that." 

The new restaurant delinitely 
does an excellent job of delivering 
only the hest of these three I:ompo-

nent~ . The lagers are intended for 
the pickiest of heer connoisseurs. 
the fmxl is 1110uthwatering, creative 
and hearty. and almost every night 
local musicians entertain on the 
outdoor patio just in case the alco-
hol Isn't making everyone merry 

enou~h . The place itself is hu~e 
and yet Ihe ,elling I." comlimahlc. 
Even the plates come in cool colors 
and shape~ . 

Gordon Biersch is unique 
among microhreweries in that they 
produce only authentic German-
style lager beers. which take up to 

~ix weeh to hrew and are ferment-

cd longer and at colder tempera-
tures than English-style ale. The 
result is smoother. less biller, and 
goes deliciously with the food -
though they contain enough calo-
ries to be meals in themselves. 
Only the finest ingredients are used 
to hrew their four signature beers. 
including Hallertauer hops, two-
row harley and a special yeast 
strain that comes directly from 
Germany. 

"We're purists when it comes to 
hccr." slated Gordon, who is the 
first American in nearly 40 years to 
graduate from the live-year brew-
ing program at the world-renowned 
Technical University of Mun'ieh in 
Weihenstephan, West Germany. 

The company's beer is available 
in hottles in Northern California, 

Hawaii and Nevada. and will be 
coming to San Diego supermarkets 
after the restaurant gains a strong 
reputation here. 

All the lager beer i~ hrewed on-
~ite. which adds to the freshness of . 
the heer and t he decor of the restau-
rant. Large glass wall~ at one end 
01 the re~taurant display the stain-

les~ ~teel hrewing tanks and the 
working hrewhouse, I:ustom-fahri-
cated in Germany. The bar is locat-
ed in thc center of the restaurant, 
indicating that heer is truly at the 
heart of the experience. At $3.75 
per pint, each lager satisfies in 
terms of its large size, fresh tlavor 
and high alcohol content. 

Craig Ericson, executive chef of 
the San Diego restaurant, provides 
a menu of international hreadth so 
there is something to satisfy every 
patron. The cornmeal dusted crab-
cakes with fennel slaw and creole 
mustard remoulade are amazing for 
an appetizer and the pan roasted 
halihut, artichoke hearts, roasted 
peppers and black olives with cit-
rus cous cous and romcsco-style 
sauee was an e'luisite culinary 
experience. And to wash all this 
down with a swig of the crisp, 
golden pilsner lager is a dining 
dream. 

The restaurant is easy to spot off 
of Highway II and is well worth the 
trip. A special Brewers' Dinner is 
available for those who would like 
a tour of the glass-encased brewery 
room with the big steel machines 
that brew (i.e., mill, lauter, boil. 
cool, ferment. lager and filter) the 
beer. And for those who like to bob 
their heads while eating, the Mis-
sissippi Mudsharks are playing 
"swingin: lowdown and funkified 
hlues" this Saturday. Gordon Bier-
sch is located on 5010 Mission 
Center Road. Call 688-1120 for 
reservations.

JEFF REMEMBERED 
Jeff Buckley's music and style will live on 

NOTES FROM THE 
UNDERGROUND 

jeff Buckley 
By Dovld DrlICOII 
Guardian Reporter 

On May 29. 1997. the world of 
rock music lost its best hope for 
the future. Jeff Buckley went for a 
quick swim in a Memphis river 
and never came out. He never fin-
ished My Sweetheart the Drunk, 
the long-awaited follow-up to his 
debut album Grace. Perhaps we 
should consider it luck that for one 
week Buckley and his bandmates 
worked like dogs to record the 10 
songs that make up the first 
record. On the day he died, Buck-
ley was heading to the studio to 

meet the band and put on the final 
touches before he stopped to cool 
off. 

Sketches for My Sweetheart 
the Drunk is a double album with 
the first disc containing the 
songs that were planned for the 
original Sweetheart and the sec-
ond comprising of rough record-
ings that Buckley had been 
working on at home. Both discs 
are so innovative and beautiful 
that it's hard to comprehend the 
thought that no more will ever 
follow. 

Buckley screams "We'll share 
our bodies in disdain for the sys-
tem" in '"fhe Sky is a Landfill." 
but whispers "Even now you're 
undressed in your dreams with 
me" in "Everybody Here Wants 
You." His lyrics range from polit-
ical animosity .to sensual lust. 
Every song sets a different mood. 
and sets it perfectly. as Buckley 
employs the amazing range of his 
voice. 

Buckley broke into the music 
industry in 1993 by releasing Live 
at Sin-e, a recording of his perfor-
mance at the small club in New 
York's East Village. In 1994 he 
released Grace and began exten-
sive touring in the UK where he 
played the Gladdonberry Festival 

in 1995. Buckley also played at 
small clubs in the United States, 
but it was in Europe where he 
found his greatest success. 

In 1995. Buckley received the 
"Gran Prix International Du 
Disque-Academie Charles 
CROS," France's most prestigious 
music award. This award has also 
been presented to Edith Piaf, 
Bruce Springsteen, Leonard 
Cohen, Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell 
and Joan Baez. Buckley had built 
a fan base and achieved legendary 
awards, hut needed a break-
through albOrn in order to make 
his mark in the mainstream; My 
Sweetheart the Drunk was that 
album but, due to his death. the 
album will never get the atteniion 
it deserved. 

Perhaps Buckley would have 
been a superstar, or perhaps he 
would have remained in the shad-
ows for the rest of his career. All 
that can be accessed is that on 
that dreadful n,ght in Memphis 
that thought was put to rest. 
Buckley's music was remarkable 
as well as ground-breaking and 
will continue to be an inspiration 
to musicians everywhere. It is 
disheartening to ponder on the 
filct that we are limited to what 
we have.

performed continuously at New 
York's Orpheum Theatre since 1994, 
always to a sold-out audience. An 
expanded version of Stomp, involv-
ing up to 30 cast members, last per-
formed at the Acropolis in Athens 
and the Royal Festival Hall in lon-
don in Seplember of 1995. This pro-
duction broke the box-office record 
that had been set by Fnmk Sinatra in 
1972. 

In addition to its numerous pres-
tigious awards, Stomp has also been 
featured as an honored guest on 
many television shows, including 
"Late Night With David Letterman," 
"General Hospital" and "Mister 
Roger's Neighborhood." The group 
performed in March 1996 at the 68th 
Annual Academy Awards and have 
even used its eye-and-ear catching 
antics in Coca-Cola and Target Store 
commercials. The members, though, 
would like it to be known that they 
do not make commercials for potato 
chips or ridiculously named audiovi-
sual stores. 

Cresswell and McNicholas creat-
ed this percussive masterpiece in the 
summer of 1991, after a I Q..year col-
laboration. 'They were both members 
of the street band Pookiesnacken-
hurger and the theater group Clill" 
Hanger. With these groups, Cress-
well and McNicholas presented a 
series of street comedy musicals at 
the Edinburgh festival throughout 
the eilrly ·~Os . 

After various collahorative com-
posing and performing projects, 
Cresswell staged. as artistic and 

HIATUS II 

musical director, four large-scale 
outdoor events, including "Beat the 
Clyde," which involved a floating 
drum orchestra on a pontoon in the 
center of Glasgow. The largest of 
these events, the "Heineken Hove 
Lagoon Show," involved a 120-
piece drum orchestra featuring the 
Brighton Festival Chorus and a full 
orchestral string section. 

Finally. when Cresswell and 
McNicholas came together to pro-
duce, finance and direct Stomp in 
1991. history was made. The show 
previewed at London's Bloomsbury 
Theatre and Premiered at the Assem-
bly Room in Edinburgh, where it 
became the Guardiall's "Critic's 
Choice" and won the Daily Expre.u· 
"Best of the Fringe" award. The 
show is just as entertaining as it was 
eight years ago and should not he 
missed. 

Imagine three really bored peoplc 
sitting around a tr.lsh bag. One pulls 
out an empty fast-food soda cup, lid 
and straw sti II intact. and makes a 
squeaking sound hy pushing the 
straw up and down. Not to he out-
done. the next person reaches in. 
head and all , and pulls out an empty 
cat' of instant t'Offee. whose rihhed 
edge makes a nice cffect when 
strummed with a stick. And the third, 
envious of the others fun, blows up a 
plastic bag and pounds it with zeal. A 
symphony results as the rejects 
sean;h through the tr.lsh bag and 
make a complex and changing 
rhythm with waste. 

It's one hell of a way to recycle.

0_ u.Mtz/Guardian 
.1IItry: UCSD men's swimming has opened up its season with formidable wins against Central 
Washington and Coe College. In its most recent meet, the Tritons beat the UCI Anteaters, 120-75. 

Swimming Drowns UCI 
FAST CRAWL: Men finish one point shy of first, but beat Div. I UC Irvine 
By Trayls Hili 
Associate Sports Editor 

If 'any of you Triton fans oul 
Ihere know a member of the UCSD 
swimming/diving squad, 
herc 's a picl:e of advil:e: uo 
nOI ask aboul Iheir win-
Icr break. 

Don 'l worry, 
Ihere's no Ihreat 
Ihal one of ·Ihe Triton 
swimmers will explode in 
violent rage al you, you're simply 
forcing Ihem 10 revisil a painful 
memory .• This memory i~ of the 
dreaded "triple-day:' 

Basically, triple-days are about 
Ihe equivalenl 10 Ihe a\'Cragc ral 
sports fan being repealedly shot in 
the lungs - for 10 ~traight days. 
Triple-days involve three inlense 
workouts every day, beginning at 
limes in the morning that the aver-
age fat sports fan did nOI know 
exisleu. 

Every winter, swimming teams 
around the nation go through this 
mind-boggling ritual, and UCSD is 
no different. The Tritons spent the 
waning days of 199t! enduring 
triple-days, then got some time off 
for the Holiday Season. They 
resumed in 1999 with the slightly-
less-excruciating double-days. 

Upon hearing this, many read-
ers would simply ask, why'! Well 
folks, it's because swimmers race. 

SALARY: 
Stop the flow before 
baseball runs awry 
ContInued frOlll INC- 11 
wi II eventually have tmgic conse-
quences for the spon as a whole. 

That is enough complaining 
about what is wrong with haseball. 
What everyone wants to know is 
how we can fix it. Baseball execu-
tives have put a moratorium on 
speaking about these problems 
because they don't want to admit 
that anything is wrong. Coming off 
possibly the greatest baseball sea-
son in the game's illustrious histo-
ry, the people that run the game, 
understandably, want the public 
and the fans to pen:eive the health 
of the game 10 be at an all time 
high. However, the truth is that 
baseball's day of reckoning is com-
ing. If something is not changed, 

That is all they do. Nothing else. 
And if they're not good at racing, 
there is no medal for "Best 
Speedo." Most swimmers do not 

have the adverse reaction that 
the average fat sports fan 

has to such 
strenuous activi-
ty. They know 
that this is the 

price Ihey must pay to 
will. 

During this past winter break, in 
the middle of UCSD's triple-day 
rnaralhon, Head Coach SCOII 
McGihon scheduled two men's and 
women's meets. The lirst was 
againsl Central Washinglon 
University, and the second oppo-
nent was Coe College. It was obvi-
ous Ihat the Tritons were eager to 
see outside competition, as they 
easily gobbled up both tea~s, 
strolling to two victories. 

Those wins provided momen-
tum for the more important UC 
Irvine Relay Meel on Jan. 3. This 
meet was for the men only, and 
they Iraveled to Irvine knowing 
that their competition would be 
considerably stitTer, as Division I 
squads Irvine and Oenver awaited. 

However, the Tritons more than 
held their o...,n, coming within one 
point of sweeping the meet. Denver 
scored 121 points on the day, and 
UCSD tallied 120. UCI was a dis-

the result could be catastrophic. 
If the baseball gurus won't dis-

cuss a solution, I will. 
There are many things that can 

be done to ensure that baseball does-
n't suffer the same fate as the NBA. 
One possibility is a hard salary cap, 
where no team would be allowed to 
exceed a certain total payroll. The 
NFL is currently the only league that 
has a hard cap, which has been suc-
cessful in the last decade. 

Another possibility is revenue 
sharing, where the teams with high 
salary levels, like the Dodgers and 
Yankees, give money to the teams 
with smaller payrolls. This is 
already taking place to a small 
degree in baseball, but the amount 
of money that is changing hands is 
just not making enough ditTerence. 
To work in baseball, this plan 
would have to be implemented on a 
larger scale. The primary argument 
against revenue sharing, however. 

tant third with 75 points. It was a 
great performance. It was obvious 
that the hungry Tritons wanted the 
win, which is a good early season 
sign. 

"The UCI meet was pretty 
encouraging for us." McGihon 
said. "It was probably prelly scary 
for (Denver and UCI) though." 

It was a solid team effort for 
McGihon's troops, but he pointed 
out junior Jason Boettner's stirring 
performance in the 800 free relay 
as exceptional. 

"He had Ihree outstanding 
swims," McGihon said. 
"Especially in the 800 free when he 
came from half a pool length 
behind to beat Denver's team." 

Another great performance was 
turned in by the 3 x 100 back relay 
squad, as Mark Latronica, Ryan 
Wong and Kent Wehde took first 
place with a time of 2:47.36. 

Other swimmers who had a 
good meet included David Tudury, 
Ross Russo; Rusty Jones and 
Danny Fisher. 

Although this meet dropped 
UCSO's record 10 2-2 on the sea-
son, this drop by no means indi-
cates a .500 team. The UCSD team 
is a great grou\l, whose first big test 
is coming up this weekend against 
Pomona-Pitzer College and 
Claremont College at Pomona-
Pitzer's pool. 

is that it is essentially a socialist 
response to a capitalist problem. 

I believe it would be in the best 
interest of the game for the players 
to agree to a salary cap. They would 
still make millions and the health of 
the game would be restored. But no 
matter what they do, they have to 
do it relatively quickly. The old 
labor agreement e:<pires in approx-
imately two years, and the NBA has 
shown us that it takes a long time 
for these talks to actually make 
some progress. 

If something isn't done, these 
contracts will continue to spiral out 
of control. With the contracts of 
such superstars as Ken Griffey Jr. 
and Alex Rodriguez about to 
expire, the amount of money that 's 
put on the table will be staggering. 
Without some kind of reform the 
game will become a shadow of it's 
former self. and the real losers will 
be you and me.

M. HOOPS: 
Tritons improve on their 
outstanding record 
ContI ................ lI 
La Jolla Classi!: in RIMAC Arena. During 
the last tournament at RIMAC, the Triton 
Tip-Off Tournament back in November, the 
Tritons stole the show by beating perennial 
powerhouse Point Lorna Nazarene College 
for the second time in a week. With tough 
teams such as Biola. Southern Cal College 
and Tennessee Temple attending the Classic. 
UCSD will be hard-pressed to repeat its 

w. HOOPS: 
UCSD has found winning 
ways with new strategies 
ContInued from ..... 11 
more in overtime. posting 15 points on the 
board. Meanwhile. the Triton defense was as 
stingy as ever. relinquishing only 9 points to 
give UCSD the 69-63 win - the Tritons' 
third victory in a row. 

"At times we didn ' t play too well ," 
Malone said, "but we played well enough to 
win." 

This sentiment rellects the way the rest of 
the season may go for this young basketball 
squad. Last year, the Tritons won many 
games by 20 points or more because their 
roster was chock full of veteran players. This 
year, the Tritons arc young and don ' t e)(pcct 
to win every coni cst by a landslide. 

"II 's going to he tou!:h-and-go all year," 
Malone said. "Every game's going to be a 
tighl." 

Many of Ihe players scratching and diving 
for the hoards and the loose balls this year are 
new 10 Ihis program. The Tritons graduated 
nine players from their 1997-98 roster, leav-
ing a vast space for rel:fuits. 

This lack of familiarity with the program 
docs come wilh its advantages, however. It

incredible performance. Yet the wa), lhis sea-
son has progressed, no one will be surprised 
if it does_ 

As for the record-breaking stlrt, the 
Tritons don't want to let it go to their heads. 

"We had a grelt first half and now we 
have to focus on having a great second half," 
Russ said. "Having our name in the record 
books is nice, but we know we need to keep 
working." 

If UCSO keeps working like it has been. 
and the season of destiny continues, the 
Tritons may find themselves in the school 
record book for another reason: UCSO's first-
ever basketball national championship. 

leaves room for more creative coaching. 
"This year's coaching stall' will be more 

involved.;' Malone said. "We're doing more 
stuff this year." 

One couid !:all this year a 'building year' 
for the Tritons, but this doesn't mean that you 
can't expect great things from them. 

"On defense, we're going to mix things up 
a lot more," Teasdale said. 

Though the 1998-99 campaign is a "build-
ing" one in the sense that there are a 101 of 
new women learning an alien program_ it will 
not be a "building year" in the sense that they 
will play terribly. 

On the contrary, these women are going to 
be tough and probably will still play into the 
postseason. 

"We still have a good opportunity to make 
the playoffs." Malone said. 

But before the Tritons yet again embrace 
postseason joys. they must face the remaining 
regular season. including two tough games 
this week: they play today against Southern 
California College. and then come home on 
Saturday to face always tough Claremont 
College. 

Though the Tritons expect these two 
mat!:hes to be tough and grueling, they 
remain poised and positive. 

"We are playing a lot beller right now," 
Teasdale said.

Reality 
Check 
IlIIBu,.., 
Greedy Bastards 
and Baseball 

So the NBA settled its labor 
dispute yesterday. My question 
is WHO THE HELL CARES'? 
The damage has been done. 
There is nothing short of Jordan 
reconsidering his decision to 
retire - or possibly the return 
of Magic Johnson and Larry 
Bird - that is going to save this 
league now. The only reason 
that I even bother mentioning 
this pot-smoking. money-grub-
bing, morally corrupt group of 
human beings is to point out 
that if baseball isn't careful it is 
going to head down the same 
path. . 

As opposed to the NBA. I 
love the major leagues. I don't 
think it was a coincidence that 
the loss of the World Series a 
few years ago corresponded to 
my 2-month bout with Mono. I 
would be very distraught if I 
were forced to relive that expe-
rience. Unfonunately. when I 
look into my baseball crystal 
ball, alii see is despair. 

Many of you have expressed 
your anger about the depanure 
of Kevin Brown from the Padres 
to the Dodgers. Even more of 
you have been outraged by the 
$105 million sum that the 
Dodgers gave to Brown. I am 
here to tell you that you can't 
blame the Padres and you can't 
blame the Dodgers. They didn't 
make the rules, they are only 
playing the game. 

for those of you who are 
actually baseball fans and not 
just bandwagon Padres fans, the 
real concern in this whole situa-
tion should be the growing dis-
parity between the big-martet 
teams and the small-market 
teams. 

Let me throw out a few sta-
tistics. Kevin Brown now makes 
approximately twice as much as 
the entire Pittsburgh Pirates 
team. In the upcoming seasen, 
the Dodgers' and Yankees' PJIY-
rolls will both be approximately 
12 times as big as Montreal 
Expos' payroll. I don't think I 
have to tell you that this is not a 
good situat.ion. When more than 
half of the teams go into the sea-
son each year with abSolutely 
no chance of making it to the 
playoffs, let alone winning the 
World Series, it is bad for the 
spon. 

Why does everyone Jove the 
NCAA Basketball Tournament" 
It is noc because there are only 
lhree teams that have a chance at 
winning the title; it is because 
every team has an opportunity to 
make its marit and upsets are 
common. That uncenainty is 
what makes spotts so exciting_

After opening their season with ' 
a school best of 12 -2, the 

Tritons continued to roll last 
Sunday with a 101-79 truding 

of Baker University for their 
13th win of the season 

By J.e Gordon 
Sports Editor 

When the University of 
Tennessee football team lost its star 
player. quanerback Peyton 
Manning, to graduation last 
year. no one put much 
faith in a suc-
cessful season 
for 1998. Yet. 
the Volunteers pulled it 
together and capped off a 
miraculous 11-0 season with a win 
over Florida State in the Fiesta 
Bowl. Without Manning, Coach 
Phil Fulmer's squad had better 
team chemistry and won the close 
games. With no true superstar, the 
team. was more balanced. This 
evenness compensated for the: 
team's other weaknesses. New 
players like quanerback Tee Manin 
stepped up in Peyton's place and 

secured Tennessee's date with des-
tiny. 

The UCSD men's basketball 
team seems to be following the 
same kind of plan. When the 

Tritons lost star center Tyler 
Field, who transferred to 

University of 
San Diego 
before the sea-

son, they were left with a 
huge void in the middle. 

Who would replace the size and 
scoring of the big man was the top 
question going into the preseason. 
The 6'9" freshman Field had rou-
tinely racked up 30 points or more. 
Yel this year. UCSD sports a 13-2 
record and is ranked in the top 10 
of Division III. 

While the Tritons lack height. 
they do not lack heart. Junior

ting time at center with senior new-
comer Ahmad Russ; both have 
been outstanding. Seniors Mike 
Wall. Nick Maroutsos, Adam 
Libby and junior Sam Higgins have 
picked up the scoring pace. The 
Tritons are in a title hunl. 

Unlike in football, basketball 
teams rarely go undefeated. Yet, the 
Tritons arc trying. They started the 
season 10-0 for the best start in 
school history before losing to 
Roben Morris College on Dec. 21. 
Head Coach Greg Lanthier's squad 
has rebounded quickly. Last 
Sunday they faced Baker 
University in the lovely RIMAC 
Arena. In their trademark fashion , 
the Tritons rolled Baker 101-79. 

The balanced attack featured 
four Tritons in double-tigures. Wall 
recorded his third 30-point perfor-
mance in a month. racking up 32 

points on 9-15 shooting. Higgins 
also broke out with another stellar 
game - 21 points including 5-9 
from three-point land. Guard Libby 
had 7 assists to go with his 6 
rebounds. Once again, the two-
headed center of McMillan and 
Russ played tough interior defense. 
Russ also led the team with 9 
rebounds otT the bench. 

UCSD .had a lead of only 6 at 
halftime, but wore down the oppo-
sition and turned up the offensive 
firepower. 

Overall. the best feature of the 
Triton attack is it 's balance. Nine 
players saw significant minutes 
against Baker. and Coach Lanthier 
has been excellent about making 
substitutions. 

The team enters the home 
stretch now, as the Tritons host the

into focus. This time, when 
the Tritons went to the line, they 
were much more successful, sink-
ing 17-26 free-throw opponunities. 
These single buckets proved to 
make the difference as regulation 
drew to an end. keeping the bigger 

girls from Montana within reach. 
Montana tried to go ahead for 

good in the tinal minutes, but the 
Tritons would not let down. The 
second half ended in a 54-54 tie. 

"We didn't have the best tirst 
half," senior guard Tristen Teasdale 
said. "But we picked things up in 
the second hal!'." 

Picking up the pace second half 
allowed the Tritons another oppor-
tunity to continue their winning 
ways, which they took advantage 
of from the opening moments of
