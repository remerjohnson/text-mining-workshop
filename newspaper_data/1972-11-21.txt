Regents and the 
Master Plan 

The California Master Plan for Higher Education 's 
proposed effects on the University of California in the 
seventies and beyond was the major topic of discussion 
of last Friday's meeting of the UC Board of Regents in 
San Francisco. 

Joseph Platt , Chairman of the Coordinating Council 
of High r Education whose Select Committee is 
presently reviewing the Master Plan, served as the 
CCHE spokesman and prese nted his Council ' s 
recommendations to the Board o f Regents. 

The Sleet Committe recommendation that met 
wi th the most opposi tion from th e Regents was one that 
proposed reduction o f the Regental term f rom 16 yea rs 
to 12 years. 

UC Presi dent Cha rl es Hitch responded to the 
~ugges t ed shortening of the term by remarking, "The 
( elect Committee) Report propo es that th (R genta l) 
t rms should be long enough to 'permit independence 
from pa rtisa n actions; yet short enough to make it 
possib le fo r the frequ nt dddition of new appointe s.' 
The latter goal is laudable, but, reali stica lly speaking, 
the propo ed change wou ld not make a substantidl 
difference in the number of new appointees ... The 
rpduced term, however, most certdinly brtngs Regental 
control well within the theoretical reach of any two-
term administration. " 

Except for his objection to the suggested term reduc-

Saltman Meets 
With AFT 

Greg Moser 
t<ppr ~entatl es of the A.FT met with \: ire-Chancellor 

P.Li altman last Friday to Jsk for riJrification of 
d In~e' of administ ration pulicil' on promotion no 
rp-,lppOlnt mpnts for faculty. ThE' contt'ndeo that the 
(.,,1ngc') In ctl on 52 of the Administrative Manu.ll 
wcrr "\erv sign tfi lant" dnd W('I£, di~m,lyed to find th,l 
">Jltmdn thought th changes "n,latl\(·h trivia!' '' Salt-
man al~o invited th ' heads of \ariou facult\ wm-
mittl'e<, who then discus~pd the (hlllgrs with the AFT 
rrps. At onr poin t altm'ln lelt the room, leaving the 
AFT fe ling that they had not gotten thp explanation 
they had come for . 

PatriC'ld Saint Lawrence, professor of Genetics at UC 
Berkeley, and Sam Bottone, xecutiv secretary of th 
University Council AFT, explained their interpr(' ta -
tlon of the changes at an open me ting jus t after the 
confere nce. Th ch anges, they said, ad d ed to the 
criteria o n which prolnotions and reappointments are 
made, restri ctions based not solely on merit, but on 
"Iimits of available funds, " the University'S need for the 
individual's services," " programmatic restrictions," and 
other budgetary and fiscal considerations. 

That faculty could not be hired if there was no money 
to pay them was implicit in the old Se tion 52, but they 
fear that by stating these policies explicitly, the ad-
ministration may be laying legal grounds for further 
action . They pointed out two Supreme Court decision ~ 
involving faculty members whose right to continued 
employment hinged on whether they had "reasonable 
expectations" that satisfactory service would lead to 
continued employment. 

In addition to fiscal considerations, Bottone said, the 
new draft of Section 52 emphasizes the temporar~ 
nature of untenured positions, which, when takel 
together may mean that no such employ.ee can havt 
any "reasonable expectations" for continued employ 
ment. Under these circumstances, the administratiol 
cou ld institute at its own discretion what is referred te 
as a " revolving door policy." This means that as junio, 
faculty climb the ladder of merit and sa lary increases, at 
any point they can be replaced by a less exp rienced 
less expensive colleague. Bottone indicated that thi ~ 
might be consistent with an interpretation of " thf 
University's need for an individual's services." 

The ladder system, insuring assistant professors op· 
portunities to become tenured faculty, has great I: 
contributed to the University of California's ability te 
produce top-flight a ademician . The effect 01 
destroying such assurance and r quiring uch p ople te 
face termination every two years can be to limi t 
research that must b funded by long term grants. 

Patricia Lawrence said the thr at com s more fron 
the sta t than th 10 al administrativ I vel. h agre ' 
with Botton that th only way to fight th rosion 0

Excerpts of interviews at UCSD with Dr . Frances 

Wel sing, Black psychiatrist from Howard Univer ity, 
Washington, D.e., will also be featured in the 35-
minute film. Director and producer of the film is O sca r 
Gandy, UC D Lecturer in Communications. Executive 
producer is Paul imms, UC D student and past 
national president of the BSSO. Filming was made 
possible through the Office of Learning Resources, 
UC D chool of Medicine. 

The film was originally produced to be shown at the 
national convention of the NB SO at the Americana 
Hotel in New York City O ctober 19-22. The documen-
tary was part of a wide-rangi ng program of event 
which included workshops on Black mental health, 
logistics, di seases largely affecting the Black population, 
n acupuncture demonstration by doctors from the 

Republic of Chllla, and interviews with U.S. medical 
hool\, A A, National Science Foundation, and the 

vtd>sdchusell Imt Itute of Technology . 
In dddition to the documentary, the B SO I, con-
U ( tll1~ a number of other projects. Ac(ording to ac 

Carreathers, atlonal Cochairman of the NBSSO and a 
udpnt at UCSD, a luncheon with somp 70 San Diego 

high school couns lors is scheduled for November 30 at

anemia te ling and genetic counseling. Last yea r, with 
the help of the Black Action Committee coordinate by 
Bernard Ashcraft, laboratory technician at UC D, ap-
proximately 5,000 people were tested. 

';The only problem with continuing the project," sa id 
Carreathers, "is a lack of funding, particularly to 
provide assistance for those who are found to have the 
disease."

A concert of contemporary musi(' featuring the 

premiere performances of several new works will be 
presented at UCSD at 8:30 p.m., Tuesday, ov. 28, in the 
Recital Hall, 409 Matthf'ws Campus. 

"Ballad I" by Berna rd Rands, a you ng Brit ish com-
poser, will be performed for the first time 111 the Uni ted 
States. In " Ballad I," dedicated to fhp memory of Judy 
Garland, the compose r creates an atmosphere of 
nostalgia through which one p('f('ei\p<, the disintegra-
tion of a cabaret performer. 

The mezzo-soprano solobt for the piece is Linda 
Vickerman, currently a fellow in the UC D Project for 
Music Experiment. Miss Vick('fman has performed 
extenSively in opera, oratorio and solo recitals. The 
work will be conducted by Dr. Ed\\ in London, conduc-
tor of the La Jolla Civic-University Orchestra and UCSD 
music faculty member. 

" Dumbarton Oaks" by Stravinsky, conceived as a 
sequel to Ba ch's "Brandenburg Conc('[tos," and 
"tibra" for sextet by the promin£'nt Spanish ('ompospr 
Roberto Gerhard, are also included in thp varied 
program. 

Gerhard, a pupil of Schoenberg, has recently be('Ome 
one of the ou tstanding composers of th (' Twentieth 
Century. "Libra," or " the balancp," I Gerhard's own 
zodiac sign. He bl" lieves that people born under the 
sa me zodiac sign have distinrtive common ('hararter 
Iraits "Libra" makes prominent use of thp Spanish 
gUitar. Dr. John Silber, Chairman of thp UCSD Musi(' 
Department, will conduct the piece. 

Also to be performed for the first time is 
" Anacoluthon," by UCSD gradual!' student Robert 
MacDougall. 

The work makes use of conflicting tempi and 
dynamics, and performers are asked at va rious times to 
divorce themselves rhythmicall y, dynamically, and tim-
brally from one another . 

M acDougall is a graduate of the Peabody Conser-
vatory of Music (1970) where he studied composition 
and piano. He received his master's in composition 
from UCSD in 1972. He spent three years in the United 
States Marine Corps and works as a forest service 
lookout in Montana during the summers.

Women Sweep 
Volleyball Tourney 

Cheryl Elliot 
The women's intercollegiate volleyball team bounced 

back to beat Mesa and win a three-day tournament 
held at Grossmont la t week. The Triton girls had 
already tied for first place in regular league play after 
they suffered their first loss of the season Tuesday at 
Grossmont. 

Wednesday, a three-day tournament began at Gross-
mont. The scheduling was rather poor, with the games 
starting in the early afternoon. Only six of the Triton 
girls attended, as an easy match against the B team of 
USIU was expected. The girls came through, winning 
15-9, 15-5 but then found out that they had to play 
State. They trounced state in their rematch 15-7, 15-1, 
and went home to prepare for their game against Mesa 
Thursday. 

Mesa was the toughest opponent the Triton girls had 
met this season. They were good enough to take 
advantage of the poor play of our girls and won. All was 
not lost though, as the tournament was double elimina-
tion; one loss put you in the losers bracket, with the 
winner of the losers bracket playing the winner of the 
winner's bracket for the championship. The girls turned 
their attention to their rematch with Grossmont Friday. 

Friday, the starting six of setters Sue Papinek and 
Carol Martindale and hitters Elaine Simay, Shelley Hill , 
Brandy Klein , and Robin got themselves together for 
not only 2 games, but six. They beat Grossmont, which 
was a good moral victory but they went on to beat Me a 
in some of the mo t exciting pressure packed and just 
plain good volleyball, that you could hope to see. 

The Triton girls were ready when they got on the 
court, winning the fIrSt game barely, 15-13. The Mesa 
airls were not to be put down easily, and rolled up a 
qUIck 14-3 lead. Our girl~, in one of the most commen-
dable and rewarding bursts of energy, bounced back to 
win that crucial game 16-16. 

Most of us would be ready to go home to bed after a 
nerve-wracking game like that one. The game was as 
tight and tense a'> a game could be. The girls had 
beaten Mesa, but due to the double elimination aspect 
of the tournament, our girls had to beat the Mesa girls 
in another 2 out of 3 game match for the title. The 
strength, thrill, and the stu bbornness of our girls wore 
out the Mesa gIrls and thev gradually succumbed 15-11, 
15-6. The girls cannot be commended nough for theIr 
valient performance.

OFF Wins 1M Crowh 
Pat Stacy 

Greece had its Golden 
Age, flourished and then 
fell ; Rome rose to rule the 
world only to see its empire 
crumble; and the DE ANZA 
guys were kings of the in-
tramural football program 
- until Sunday. Yes, fans, 
the last page of a legend has 
been written as a hard-
playing bunch of sopho-
more jocks known as OFF 
AGAIN have dethroned the 
perennial Champs. DE 
ANZA finished on the short 
end of a 14-13 score, but 
the game was even closer 

. than that score would in-
dicate. Regulation play 
found the score tied 13 all 
and it remained for a very 
tough tie-breaker to yield 
the point that dealt DE 
ANZA its first loss in 3 years . 

In OFF AGAIN's finest 
hour it was Don Reordan 
emerging as perhaps 
UCSD's premier athlete, 
having an outstanding day 
both offensively and defen -
sively, Don scored a total of 
7 points including the ty-
ing touchdown on a run 
off-tackle. Brad Tebo's ex-
cellent job of mIxing his 
plays was one of the two 
factors that neutralized DE 
ANZA's famed our-man 
rush, The other factor was 
the tough, pocket protec-
tion given by the OFF line 

of Bill Gates, Scott Bone-
steel and Bob Beck. Their 
blocking gave Brad the time 
he needed to make his 
passing game click ... and 
click it did, with Keith 
Kaplan hauling in one TD 
and Reordan grabbing 
several coming out of the 
backfield, 

DE ANlA looked like 
they were going to wipe 
OFF off the field in the first 
half as they built up a 13-0 
lead on scoring strikes from 
Roudebush to Coleman 
and Warner (both of whom 
played excellent football). 
But in the second half, the 
fired-up OFF pass rush 
forced Jimmy out of the 
pocket time, and again 
making him hurry his passes 
and not giving him time to 
spot his secondary 
receivers. Nevertheless, DE 
ANZA only had one yard to 
go to win the tie-breaker, 
but when John Roland 
knifed in front of Coleman 
to knock away Sprout's 
pass, he knocked off DE 
ANZA's chance for an un-
blemished record ... and 
for OFF AGAIN, pen-
demonium reigned.

basically nothing was 
decided about the league 
champs as both the Scud

a 3-way tie. The fine com-

was dominated by Jay Russo

\\ I 'r '~. w \" j lJ • ! lr, 

At Breier Sound Center we believe that it is not the money you 
save, but what you get for the money you spend which 
determines a good value in a stereo system. For that reason we 
sell a $385 Component system consisting of KLH, Garrard and 
Shure products. 

Our system features a KLH model Fifty-one AM-FM Stereo 
receiver which delivers a total of 40 RMS watts into a pair of KLH 
model S vent en speak r . The v('nteen are a two way 
sp aker ystem which al a happen to be one of our best selling 
models. A Garrard 42M automatic turntable fitted with a hure 
M75ECS cartridge and diamond n edle round out the sy tem . 

The $385 price tag does show a savings of $105.80 off the 
individual selling prices of the separate components. But-we 
rep at-it is the product and not th saving, which make this 
system a good value.

Transplant 
"The University of Cali-

fornia is one of the world's 
leaders in kidney trans-
plantation," said Dr 
amuel Kountz , assocIate 

professor of surgery and 
co-director of the Trans-
plantation Center at UC San 
Franci sco. 

Since the first kidney 
transplant operation In 
1954, more than 500 such 
operations have been per-
formed on L..C campuses. 

" In terms of r('~('arch and 
technique\, the Uni.erslt, 
of Cllifornia ha con-
trrbuted mor(' than an~ 
other center 10 the areas of 
tl sue tYping, organ pre-
servation and manage-
ment of post-transplant 
patients," Kountz said 

"Proper matching of 
donor and recipient are 
keys to successful trans-
plants. If a proper match is 
achieved, the patient's im-
munological defenses will 
not destroy the transplant, 
and the use of drugs which 
supress immunological 
defenses will nol bE 
needed," he said.
