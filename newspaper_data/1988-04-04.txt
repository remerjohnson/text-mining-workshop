World trouble 
spots may delay 
stone shipments 

By ROBERT LEONE 
Selfio, SttdJ W,iter 

The new University Center is 
about 35 days behind schedule, 
and will probably open in Feb-
ruary of 1989, according to Uni-
versity Center Director Jim 
Carruthers. 

"There are a certain number of 
rain days where they just can't 
work," Carruthers said, adding 
that enough of the roof of the 
new building had been installed 
that rain would not be a major 
delaying factor in the future. He 
projected that the building will 
be completed approximately 40 
to 45 days behind schedule. 

Carruthers did express worry 
over possible delays with some 
of the external decorative stone-
work. Pale Jerusalem stone is 
supposed to be used in the build-
ing's trim, but Carruthers was 
worried that recent disturbances 
in the Middle East would cut off 
stone shipments from Israel. 

The Acting Assistant Vice 
Chancellor for Design and Con-
struction. Boone Hellman, said, 
"We have been advised that the 
quarrying of the stone is pro-
ceeding." Hellman admitted that 
there may be some delay because 
of problems with the Jerusalem 
stone, which is quarried by Arab 
laborers, but the contractor, 

Robert Leone/ Guardian 
Sources say the Price Center is "45 percent complete." In the 
foreground is Portuguese marble, used for exterior decoration. 

Blake Construction, hasn't indi-
cated that " w08kl be pMOo

lines because of the Jerusalem 
stone. 

"We were very concerned that 
the demonstrations and violence 
would delay the stone," said 
Assistant Vice Chancellor for 
Undergraduate Affairs Tommy 
Tucker. According to Tucker, 
the first shipment of Jerusalem 
stone is already on board ship 
and on it's way to UCSD. 

Robert Thornburn, Project 
Manager for the Price Center 
(named for a major contributor), 
confirmed Tucker's statements, 
stating that the stone was en 

route to UCS 
ahrou.h the Panama nal, and 
that's a problem too," Thorn-
burn said. 

The first shipments of 
polished Portuguese golden 
marble arrived at the building 
site durin. spring break. Accord-
ing to Thornburn, several rows 
,of Portuguese marble can be laid 
before the contractors would 
need to use the Jerusalem stone. 
The" Amarillo gold" Portuguese 
marble is a primary part of the 
new building's external decora-
tive scheme, and there appar-
ently have been no problems

Cultural Board ~ 
aims to avoid 
the mainstream 

By JILL COLLEY 
GUlUditut Ilfte,,, 

In order to "counteract main-
stream programming," the As-
sociated Students (A.S.) has 
recently activated a committee 
called the Cultural Programming 
Board. The function ofthe board 
is to review proposed events that 
have a cultural emphasis and 
establish some basic guidelines 
on what constitutes a 'cultural 
event.' 

This committee has been in 
the A.S. charter since fall of 
1986, but has not been active. 

One goal of the A.S. this year 
was to emphasize more diverse 
programming. A.S. President 
Dave Marchick said that he feels 
the A.S. council has done a pretty 
good job so far this year in spon-
soring cultural events and alter-
native programs. 

However, both Marchick and 
A.S. Programmer P.O. Devers 
a.ree that more can be done. 
Devers, who also heads the Cul-
tural Programming Board, said 
that this was one of the main 
reasons for bringing this com-
mittee back into existence. 

"The A.S. activated this board 
in an effort to have more cultural 
programming and get things 
going in order to counteract the 
mainstream programming that 
we have on campus," Devers 
said. 

He said that he and his com-
mittee members "want more cul-
tural programming events ... and 
the money to go towards events 
that are cultural and not just 

mainstream events that say 'cul-
tural' on the top line in order to 
use funds that weren't really 
allocated towards them." 

Devers said he feels that "the 
A.S. is very conservadve and is 
also very Greek-oriented," 
adding that 10 of the 22 voting 
members are also members of 
Greek organizations. Marchick 
said that the majority of this 
year's council are G.reeks but 
that "this isn't something that 
should be turned against Greeks," 
adding that "everybody has the 
same opportunity to run."

United States castigated 
for scientific illiteracy 

By CYNTHIA CHESY 
St~J W,ite, 

The conclusion reached at a 
UCSD symposium last week was 
that the American people and 
many politicians are largely 
scientifically illiterate, and both 
executive branch and Con-
gress were soundly criticized for 
their lack of comprehension of 
what science can do for the 
country. 

A dozen prestigious national 
science adv i"~r:; and heads of 
universities convened on campus 
last Tuesday for a symposium 
titled, "Science, Government and 
the Economy," to discuss the 
importance of increasing the 
public's, as well as the Presi-
dent's, understanding of the 
importance of science and point 
to solutions to the inadequacie 

of the science-government rela-
tionship that have led to Ameri-
can's scientific, technological and 
economic decline. 

William Carey, the executive 
director of the American Asso-
ciation for the Advancement of 
Science, and other panelists 
illustrated the cultural pathology 
of science negativism in Ameri-
can schools and government 
institutions. He blamed the 
general lack of knowledge among 
the public about science on an 
uninformed press, TV and radio, 
and that "kids today are fearful 
of scientists." 

According to UCSD Chancel-
lor Richard Atkinson, who 
moderated the talk, 60 percent of 
all students earning doctorates 
in engineering at UCSD la t year 
were not U.S. citizens. "We can't 
depend on a constant influx of 

foreign students to keep the U.S . 
in the forefront . . . they [the for-

History professor nominated 
for documentary Oscar 

John Dower, the Joseph Naiman Profes or of 
Japanese Studies at UCSD, has been nominated for 
an Academy Award for "Hellfire: A Journey from 
Hiroshima," a film he co-produced. The film is a 
documentary about two Japanese artists whose 
murals about the first city to be destroyed by an 
atomic bomb are world famous . "Hellfire" is one of 
five films nominated for an Oscar for best 
documentary. 

"Hellfire" portrays the life and art of Iri and Toshi 
Maruki, husband and wife artists who are now in 
their 80s . The film depict four decades of collabora-
tion between the two as they created their murals. 
They were at Hiroshima immediately after the bomb 
fell and painted the tragedy over a period of two 
decades. In t he early 1970s, they went beyond the 
atomic bomb experience and began painting other 
topics such as the Rape of Nanking. the Auschwitz 
concentration camp and the destruction of the 
environment. 

"Their vision of the destructiveness of our modern 
age has become more and more powerful," Dower 
said. "I don't think I would have done the movie if it 
had j ust been about the atomic bomb itself. It was 
the ability not merely to face up to the bomb as 
artists , but also to go beyond that that makes their 
vi ion so compelling." 

The film has already received several awards 
incl uding a grand prize at the an Francisco Inter-
national Film Festival, the Marjorie Benton Peace 
Film Award , and a gold prize in the Competition for 
Films on Japan . 

Dower is the country's leading authority on the 
American occupation of Japan and the way the 
occupation changed Japanese society followi ng 
World War II . 

Toyotas popular burlary target; 
car alarms prevent break-ins 

During the fir t 50 days of 1988. 13 vehicles were 
stolen from the UCSD campus, co mpared with a 
total of 70 for all of 1987 and 38 for 1986. 

Campus police figures indica te that the cars most 
favored by thieves are Toyota Celicas, Corollas and 
pickup trucks . They can be broken into in 10 
seconds by a thief using a sha rp instrument resem-
bling an ice pick . 

Car alarms seem to stop thefts. UC police Sgt. 
Bob Jones said he does not know of a case of a car 
that was fitted with an alarm being stolen . However, 
some cars with alarms have been broken into and 
had their radios stolen wit hin 35 seconds. 

The VA 170A (Beginning Sculpture) class final pro-
ject last quarter depicted people waiting in line. 

The recovery rate is estimated at 80 percent , but 
some of those are stripped . The large lots at Revelle, 
Muir and Third Colleges are the most vulnerable, 
according to Jones. 

Six researchers win 525,000 
Sloan Researcher Fellowships 

Six reserarchers at UCSD are among 90 "young 
scientists of extraordinary promise" from through-
out the United States selected to receive fellowships 
from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. 

UCSD and Princeton, with six fellows each , led 
41 other universities in the number of faculty 
members chosen. 

Three of the winners are from the physics faculty: 
Patrick H. Diamond. Herbert Levine and Andrei E. 
Ruckenstein; two are from chemistry: John D. 
Simon and T. Don Tilley; and the sixth is from 
mathematics: Ruth J . Williams. 

The Sloan Research Fellowships are designed "to 
identify exceptionally able young scientists and to 
provide them with flexible funding that can be used ' 
to advance their research in whatever way they think 
best ," according to Albert Rees, president of the 
foundation. Fellows receive awards of S25,OOO each. 

The Sloan Research Fellowships have been 
awarded annually for 33 years "as a means of encou-
raging basic research by young scholars at a time in 
their careers when teaching duties can be most press-
ing and when other support is difficult to obtain." 
Thirteen former Sloan fellows have won Nobel 
prizes.

Science leaders call for more education MICHAEL FOULKS 
Advutising Manage, 

Continued rrom pale I 
eign students] are staying in this 
country now, but will they con-
tinue to stay?" 

Erich Bloch, director of the 
National Science Foundation, 
went so far as to say that the 
American value system, espe-
cially ' among high school and 
college undergraduates, needs to 
be changed. 

Is it true that most students 
are turned off by science engi-
neering, and, if so, why? The 
consensus among the panelists 
was Yes, and the reason : faulty 
reward system.

Chancellor Atkinson 

"Would-be Ph. Os have to face 
getting their first grant, which is 
very difficult, and then having to 
make it within the next one-to-
two years or face losing the 
grant," said Joshua Leder berg, 
Nobel Laureate and president of 
Rockefeller University. "They 
face this pressure for the rest of 
their lives. Many young scient-
ists are afraid of this environ-
ment." 

But the finger of blame for 
American's perceived decline in 
world power was mostly pointed 
at uneducated government deci-
sion-makers who do not have the 
basic knowledge or background 
to make informed decisions on 
science policy. According to 
Carey, personal relationships 
rather than expertise playa cru-
cial part in selecting even a pre-
sidential science adviser. 

"Would-be Ph.D.s 
have to face getting 
their first grant, which 
is very difficult, and 
then having to make it 
within the next one-to-
two years or face 105-
i ng the grant." . 

-Joshua Lederberg 
Nobel Laureate 

Primary and secondary school 
educators and parents were also 
denounced as co-conspirators in 
the breeding of a generation of 
scientific dunces. 

While many causes of Ameri-
ca's scientific ignorance were 
rooted out, solutions as to how 
to elevate science education and 
policy to new levels of con-
sciousness among these groups 
ranged from vague to extreme. 
Frank Press, president of the 
National Academy of Sciences. 
suggested that the presidential 
science adviser should be a 
generalist with a broad-based 
scientific background who com-

ments on everything that goes to 
the president; he should be a full 
assistant. Now, the presidential 
science adviser cannot even gua-
rantee getting the president on 
the phone, according to Carey. 

Another panelist called for a 
complete reconstruction of the 
bureaucratic science-government 
relationship. KWe have to have 

some action in another national 
science board without the com-
pressing administrative strangu-
lation that goes with forming 
another board, ~ said William 
Golden, the president's science 
policy consultant during the 
Truman administration. 

All of the speakers concluded 
that the United States is far away 

from having the research that 
needs to exist to compete in 
world economics. Some of the 
speakers, including Chancellor 
Atkinson, wondered out loud ... 
"Do we have the time it will take 
[to attract students to the scien-
ces and still] sustain our eco-
nomic and military superi-
ority?" !ill

Run For It 
We hunch over our books in a cold, hard place. 

The spiny concrete structures, embedded bureau-
cracy, emphasis on remote laboratory research and 
pressures of the professional paths most undergrad-
uates choose t o wa lk combine to lend a distinct chill 
to t he a ir. 

It is convenient for the administration to funnel 
each of us through this system every four to five 
years, taking ad vantage of our status as temporary 
occupants t o pretty much ru n t hings the way it sees 
fit. 

One way the student body can fight this tendency 
to overlook t he student is to util ize its quasi-
p e rmanent bureauc racy , the A .S . government. 
U nfortunately, the A. S. has become a clubby home 
fo r those with prefab social structures and a comfor-
table income from home. This comfort does not 
encourage activism. 

Can you imagine the current A .S. government 
lead ing a demonstration for better student / T A 
ratios, cleaning the Aegean Stables of financial aid , 
or even pressuring the Pub to stop serving Coors 
beer (currently boycotted by black, gay, union and 
civil liberties groups)? 

Can you image our A .S. demanding more of a 
student say in the way parking fees are structured, or 
demanding an explanation for the revenue based 
parking fine situation? How about d e manding that 
Chancellor Atkinson dump some of his National 
S cience Foundat ion quests long enough to 
examine the enfeebled communication department? 

T he A.S. has abandoned the confrontational style 
that t raditionally gets the most for students at 
UCSD, that can lead to a change in the way the 
administration considers us as a group. 

Today is the deadline for filing to run for A .S . 
office. If you know someone who's running who you 
think can light fires under the A .S . and the adminis-
tration, give them some support. If you think y ou 
can do it , get a petition this morning and get some 
signatures. 

Right in Spring 
By the time you read th is, the Red Sox will be 

either involved in or finished with the first game in 
the major league season. Baseball is upon us and all 
is right in spring. 

This year brings tremendous teams in San Fran-
cisco and Oakland, and a talented group of very 
young players in San Diego (as well as the incom-
parable Tony Gwynn) . 

That's pro baseball; both the UCSD baseball and 
softball teams are outstanding this year and are 
worth a look, too. Certainly, the price of admission 
is right and both teams play exciting styles of ball . 
The men's team is prone to steals of home and 
vicious displays of power; the women play an unus-
ually high-scoring game,

Letters 
Parking Fees 
Will Go Up 
Editor: 

On Monday , March 7 at 9 am, the 
Parking and Transportation Alter-
nat ives Advisory Committee held its 
second meeting.of the 1987-88 school 
year. This committee, of which 1 am 
a member, is made up of faculty, 
staff, and students, and has the 
responsibility of making recom-
mendations to Steven Relyea, vice 
chancellor of business affairs , con-
cerning park.ing policy at UCSD. 
While this is only an advisory com-
mittee, its recommendations have 
been implemented by the vice chan-
cellor over the past few years. 

There are six undergraduate stu-
dent representatives on the 
23-member committee. In contrast, 
of the 14,000 on-campus parking 
permits sold this year, students pur-
chased 7,683. 

During Monday's meeting, the 
committee was presented with a 
parking permit rate proposal for 
1988-89 by Robert Umstead, man-
ager of Parking and Transportation 
Services at UCSD. The proposal 
was for "a general increase in faculty, 
staff and student rates on campus of 
$2 per month." 

This translates to a 9 percent 
increase for the faculty and staff and 
a 14 percent increase for students. 
Had this proposal been put into 
effect , students' yearly parking rates 
would have risen from SI17 to 5135. 

However, a number of the com-
mittee's members pointed out that 
this increase seemed unfair in that it 
would be making unequal percen-
tage increases. Furthermore, the 
committee was being asked to vote 
on only one proposal , given no other 
options to consider. 

A number of other rate-increase 
models were requested , among them 
an increase by an equal percentage 
of the A, B, and S permits . A meet-
ing was scheduled for March II , the 
Friday of that same week, to con-
sider these new proposals. 

A mysterious thing happened 
between Monday and Friday ofthat 
week. The "needed revenue" of 
Monday's rate proposal was not 
used to generate the five new prop-
osals presented on Friday. These 
new proposals ranged from an equal 
percentage increase to an extreme 
which would have made all permits 
cost the same, at a yearly rate of 
SI97.73. There was now a need for 
580,000 more in revenues, we were 
told, from a nonexistent need four 

days earlier. We were not given the 
option we h~d earlier. 

During Friday's meeting there was 
a great deal of debate, some intelli-
gent, some not, which I have not the 
space here to relate, nor do I believe 
the knowledge of which would 
interest most people. Those who are 
interested, however, may obtain 
minutes of the meeting from the 
Parking and Transportation Servi-
ces office. 

The final result ofthe meeting was 
a monthly increase of 53 for faculty 
and staff and a 54 increase for stu-
dents. In addition, a new remote 
permit will be available to 851 peo-
ple, faculty , staff, and students, at a 
rate ofS7 per month. If this propoSal 
is accepted by tbe vice chancellor, it 
would mean an increase of 12.5 per-
cent for faculty, 14 percent for staff 
and 24 percent for students.

George Bush has had a lot of easy

We asked Hunter Thomspn 
what he thought of George Bush. 
The doctor submitted this re-
sponse. (Thompson will continue 
to appear regularly on Thurs-
days this quarter.) 

I think he s the only real presi-
dential candidate we have. Well, 
the Democrats arm 'I in thefight 
and they 're all splil up, so ... And 
the Republicans are the only ones 
who are organized so if I was bel-
ling il would be Bush.

Skinner called from Wa-shington last week and warned me that I was dan-
gerously wrong and ignorant 
about George Bush. "I know you 
won't want to hear this, "he said, 
"but George Bush is an utterly dif-
ferent person from the one you've 
been whipping on, for that matter.

I have no icha. J mean I'm a

Kentucky-Maryland game. I had 
given 5 points, and Kentucky 
was ahead by 7 with 18 seconds 
to go.... George Bush meant 
nothing to me, at that moment. 
The whole campaign was like the 
sound of sOl11e radio far up the 
street. 

But Skinner persisted, for some 
reason.... He was trying to tell 
me something. He was saying 
that Bush was not what he seemed 
to be - that somewhere inside

Well, I don 't like George Bush 
any more than J like Reagan, 
although he does have a beller

hate to see another Republican in 
the office.

Why No 
Alcohol? 
Continued from pale 4 
cant element in this process 
involves exposure to and exper-
imentation with alcohol, along 
with other facets of American 
social life. The problem is, 
whether the adminstrat ion 
chooses to recognize this 
important fact or not, college 
students will engage in varying 
degrees of alcohol usc. 

If students find it impossible 
to do so here, there is always 
the frightening convoy to 
Tijuana, which leaves from any 
residence ball every Friday and 
Saturday night, and is an easy 
alternative for the underage 
drinker_ It 's unfortunate and 
ridiculous for students to be 
risking their lives for the sake of 
an unbarassed beer. Anyone 
who doesn 't recognize the 
potential for a drunk-driving 
tragedy is either blind, stupid 
or both. 

I'm not proposing that we set 
up kegs in the Muir Quad, or 
play quarten in Revelle Plaza, 
but I think. a little tolerance is a 
more favorable alternative to 
students endangering their lives. 
Luckily, we've been spared from 
catastrophe thus far_ Will we 
continue to be so lucky? 

Further, as I said, students 
need to be free to make their 
own choices in a controlled 
"adult" environment. They will 
do so with or without the safety 
of univenity supervision. Just 
as abortions will inevitably 
occur whether they're legal or 
not, so will college drinking. 
Safety should be a central con-
cern when dealing with either 
issIJe. 

I'm a transfer student here at 
UCSD, and I think this is an 
outstanding institution of 
higher learning. I propose that 
we apply the same logic to our 
campus life as we do in our 
prestigious academics. 

Tony Boyd 

Parking 
Fees Up? 
Continued from pale 4 
Assuming that no remote per-
mits were purchased by mem-
ben of the faculty and staff, 
only a lucky II percent of the 
student body will benefit from 
an approximate 47 percent 
decrease in their yearly parking 
rate. 

One adminstrative represen-
tative on the committee astutely 
points out that "park.ing is not 
an inalienable right ." Yes, we 
have very few inalienable rights, 
yet , as students who carry most 
of the financial burden of the 
parking system at UCSD, I feel 
we have at least some rights as 
consumers. These rights ought 
to include not having a 24 per-
cent increase imposed on us . 

Those concerned about th is 
and future rate increases of a 
similar nature ought to make 
their voices heard to both their 
representati ves in student 
government and to Vice Chan-
cellor Relyea. who will be mak-
ing the final decision. But as it 
stands now, at least 89 percent 
of the students at UCS D next 
year will be paying S 153 a year 
for a parking permit .

Off the streets, out of trouble 

Youth for Progress lends a hand to kids 
Editor's note: This orticle is 

the first of a two-part series on 
the Youth/or Progress program. 
Part two will be in Thursday's 
edition. 

By CHAD B. SKOPP 
Cutuditur filion 

T here are serious problems facing much of America's growing underclass. And , 
while many people are declaring 
that these issues are untreatable, 
there are others working to affect 
social change. Examples of such 
concern and commitment are 
advancing in a nearby, though 
alienated, community. 

Located on Market Street in 
the Independence Building, the 
main office of Youth for Pro-
gress stands in a district that 
reflects the poverty of certain 
parts of downtown San Diego. 
Aside from the charming images 
of a maritime resort are the eas-
ily noticeable signs of deteriora-
tion: Streets are fiUed with debris, 
the homeless, and feelings of 
despair. Even the aging Inde-
pendence Building appears in 
many placel: to be decaying. But 
once inside the Youth for Pro-
gress's office, one can immedi-
ately sense the activity. 

Serving the children and tee-
nagers of San Diego, Youth for 
Progress is a juvenile diversion 
program. Opened in 1967, it was 
the first non-profit agency in San 
Diego designed to serve problem 
or potentially delinquent youths. 
The goal of the program has 
been to assist adolescents in 
obtaining self-sufficiency and 
success. 

At the heart of this program is 
Pam Peterson, Youth for Pro-
gress's executive director for the 
last five years. A strong-minded 
individual, Peterson displays 
deep concern for her work. Intent 
on getting her points across, she 

speaks with both eloquence and 
strength. 

"If they [the youth] can just be 
good at one thing, they feel good 
about themselves, and they don't 
necessarily then find gratification 
outside of the law," Peterson 
explained. 

Peterson has worked at Youth 
for Progress for the last 15 years. 
In her first years at the agency, 
she started two women's pro-
grams: one in Southeast San 
Diego for low-income women, 
and the other, called Outlook 
House, in South Bay. The latter 
was the first youth center in the 
nation that served low-income 
women. 

Youth for Progress itself is 
comprised of three programs. 
Two arc youth-serving branches, 
while the third is an emergency-
crisis service agency. Of the two 
youth-oriented programs, the 
Spring Valley branch serves ado-
lescents ages to through 18, while 
the Logan site works with those 
between the ages of five and 18. 

According to Peterson, there 
is a follow-up period of three to 
six months in which Youth for 
Progress tracks clients whom 
they have assisted . After 12 
weeks, the limiting contractual 
period for which the agency is 
federally funded to work with 
each client, 75 percent to 90 per-
cent of the children have "no 
further contact with the law." 

But Youth for Progress does 
not just help juveniles; the agency 
also attempts to treat their 
environments. "We talk to the 
family, to the teachers, to bring 
everyone in to resolve some of 
the problems centered around 
the kids," Peterson added . Lack 
of social understanding between 
students and teachers can be a 
problem. 

At one time, the agency took 
over 60 teachers from the Poinl 
Lorna School for a tour of the 

Logan Barrios, from where some 
of the underprivileged adoles-
cents come. Peterson recal\ed 
that 90 percent of the teachers 
were not previously aware of 
Barrio Logan's location. 

"We pointed out some of the 
circumstances that our children 
faced even before they got to that 
school," she observed. Follow-
ing that activity, the teachers had 
a much different attitude about 
their students and a substantial 
number of the students' grades 
improved. 

According to Peterson, the 
adolescents run into social prob-
lems for a variety of reasons. On 
a basic level, they are clearly 
aware of the potentiality of 
nuclear war. The threat inhibits 
their desires to achieve. devalu-
ing the importance of obtaining 
success in an uncertain future. 
Peterson explained that when

she talks openly with a child, "a 
lot of time they will say, 'Why 
bother? The world is going to 
end tomorrow anyway; a bomb 
is going to drop.' " The fear 
causes them to " .. . feel helpless 
to their environment." 

Peterson believes that drug 
abuse is another serious problem 
facing many of San Diego's 
underc1ass. She explained that 
"PCP is again becoming the drug 
of choice," due to the increasing 
price of the drug 'crack.' There is 
also a tremendous alcohol 
problem. 

"When youngsters do not 
receive support, are isolated and 
poor, and watch television, see-
ing the haves (people that have 
everything) are not necessarily 
given respect at school, and are 
in an environment where they 
arc unable to compete, [then 
they realize] that their future is 

very bleak, which is why they get 
involved with drugs," Pe~erson 
said. 

Gangs also pose a problem to 
many of Youth for Progress's 
youngsters. Many of these kids 
join gangs for self-defense. They 
live in areas where they are actu-
ally pressured into being gang 
members. Although the gangs 
may playa supportive role for 
the child (for many member, it is 
the substitute for a lack of family 
and respect), they can often put 
pressure on its members to per-
form delinquent acts, such as 
stealing goods that they could 
never regularly hope to obtain. 

Finally, much of the adoles-
cents' anti-social behavior stems 
from a feeling of 'low self-
worth.' "These kids are lonely 
... there is a feeling of hopeless-
ness and isolation," Peterson 
added. ~

Triton rowers go O-for-4 in Cup races 
UCLA, u. of Washington, UC Davis and UCSB win big at annual Crew Classic 

More than 2,000 'rowers from 
80 U.S. and Canadian colleges, 
universities and rowing clubs 
participated this past weekend in 
the fi fteenth annual San Diego 
Lowenbrau Classic. 

For nine hours of sand, sun 
and suds (the race was, afterall, 
sponsered by Lowenbrau), spec-
tators witnessed 45 races, races 
that featured poss ible members 
of this summer's U.S. Olympic 
crew teams . 

An estimated 30,000 specta-
tors watched UCLA take the 
coveted Copley Cup for the first 
time in Crew Classic history, 
beating the Navy oarsmen on a 
disqualification. 

Almost 10 yards from the fin-
ish line, the Navy boat, having 
been in first place for the entire 
2,OOO-meter course, crossed into 
UCLA's rowing lane, locking 
oars with the second-place boat. 
As they crossed the finish line, 
referee Julian Wolf disqualified 
Navy. The Navy boat had already 
infringed upon UCLA's lane 
twice during the race. 

The University of Washington 
won its second consecut ive 
Whitt ier Cup (the women 's 
equivalent to the men's Copley 
Cup), blowing by second-place 
Wisconsin, 7:02.38-7:09.58. 

., .. "',eu/ GIIII,di"" 
Last year, the UCSD men's lightweight team came within hall a second from qualifying for the fina ls 
This year only the women 's lightweight team participated in the finals - one 01 the university's worst 
showings in the annual Crew Classic. 

The California Cup is awarded women's varsity eight races universities. UC Davis took its 
to the winner of the men '5 and among California colleges and first men's . cup with a time of 

Major League commentary-

6 :31.42 . The University of 
Southern California (6:34.33) 
finished in second place for the 
second straight year. 

UC Santa Barbara, clocked at 
7:38.90, won its second consecu-
tive women's California Cup, 
corning from behind to beat 
runner-up San Diego State Uni-
versity (7:43.30). 

UC San Diego participated 
but only the women's lightweight 
team managed to place in top 
three places with a time of 8:05.82 
flehind UC Davis (second, 
8:02.58) and NaCL (first, 
7:43.87). 

Last year, the Tritons man-
aged to qualify only the women's 
novice team ·to the finals. The 
men's lightweight team missed 
ijualifying by less than half a 
second last year. 

The Crew Classic has tradi-
tionally symbolized the beginning 
of the rowing season for most 
schools. UCSD is no exception. 

The men's team will go on the 
road during the next week to 
face Santa Clara and UC Davis 
on Saturday and Sunday, April 
9 and 10, respectively. The 
women's team will travel up to 
Long Beach to row against Long 
Beach State University on 
Sunday. 

-JonathaD Schretet 

A look at what the 1988 season has in store 
Editor 's note: This is part one 

of a four-part series on major 
league baseball. 

It s April. Springtime. Time to 
dig into those closets and find 
that milt, that bat and that ball 
that have been coilecting dust for 
thepastflve months. Yeah, major 
league baseball is back, you can 
feel it in the air. 

Remember last year? It seems 
like only yesterday that the Mil-
waukee Brewers were shocking 
the baseball world with 13 
straight wins out of the gate. 
Remember Montreal's Tim 
Raines' salary problems? In his 
first game back he wentfour-to-
four with a triple and a grands-
lam. We all thought Andre Daw-
son was get/ing old and he fin-
ished with a National League 
M VPaward. 

Last year was definitely a year 
to remember. Balls were fly ing 
out of parks by the dozens. In 

order to compensate, nail files 
and sandpaper became as popu-
lar as chewing tobacco and bub-
ble gum. The Minnesota Twins 
just couldn 't lose at home. The 
California Angels did lose and 
became the first team to drop 
fromfirst place to last in a season. 

This year the big issues are 
already the balk, a new strike 
zone and female umpires. We'll 
see what else the 1988 has in 
store for us. Yeah, baseballs 
back! 

American LeaCH [ast 

The American League East is 
by far the best division in base-
ball - the deepest and most 
talented since divisional play 
commenced 20 years ago. Five 
teams would be a favorite to win 
any other division, but only two 
teams, Boston and Toronto, are 
strong enough to win here. 

Another distinguishing factor 
of the East is the Shithead Fac-

tor. With Steve Garvey retired, 
there are more shitheads per team 
in the AL East than any other 
division . 

In predicted order of finish: 
100ton - Oil Can Boyd is a 

new father. Don't you think there 
should have been some kind of 
test he had to pass before be wu 
allowed to do that? Boyd will 
combine with Roger Clemons 
and Bruce Hurst to give the Red 
Sox the best starting three in 
baseball (Shut up, Met's and A's 
fans). Dewey Evans won't be 
back: in RF, where God intended 
him to be, but with Evans and 
Jim Rice, Mike Greenwell, Sam 
Horn and Ellis Burks in the liDe-
up, the Sox should score almOit 
as many runs as the Yankeea. 
(The third baseman probably 
won't hurt, either.) 

Lee Smith, robbed from tbe 
Cubs at gunpoint (the only pos-
sible explanation for the 
Smith / Schiraldi-Nipper deal), 

will be great until late July or 
August, when his knees will give 
out if John McNamera hasn't 
rested him enough. A key to the 
Red Sox season will be the per-
formances of Wes Gardner and 
Bob Stanley backing Smith; if 
tbey're good and Smith hasn't 
appeared in 3S games by the AII-
star break, the Sox will romp. 
The other key: Ellis Burks,lead-
ins off, must have aD OBP of 
.370 or so. Any less and 
McNamera will have to shufOc 
his lineup, which hedocsD't know 
how to do. 

TOI'oato - The key here is 
whether Dave Steib and Tony 
Gernandez make joint trips to 
rehab or the All-star team. The 
Tiler-Jay series at the end of laat 
season was the real World Ser-
ies, as good as any Series since 
the '72 Reds-A's and '76 Red 
Sox-Reds matches. It exposed 
two Toronto weaknesses: they 
must have Fernandez playing all 

the time (Manny Lee won't do) 
and Ernie Whitt must be behind 
the plate. 

Ignore Bell's whining about 
being' a OH; he'l come around 
and the rest of the Toronto line-
up is still awesome. No ODe can 
match the Henke/ Eichhorn 
bullpen duo, Key and Cerutti are 
the starting ancbon and Jesse 
Barfield will be named AL MVP. 
Put them down for 9S-IOO wins 
and fint place if the Red Sox 
fold. 

New York - Yankeea/Indi-
ans games should be something 
to watch, with pOiDt spreads as 
high as seveD to 10 runs. Actu-
ally, the Yankeea should thank 
God for the IRdians, because 
otherwise they'd have by far the 
wont pitching ill the majon, 
worse even than the Padres. 
Guidry, mOitly useless anyway, 
il out until at least May. Rhoden 
it fading, Candelaria is good for

Women's tennis aces Mills, Stanislaus 
By JONATHAN SCHRETER 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD women's tennis 
team remained busy for the entire 
spring vacation hosting five 
matches at the Muir Courts. 

T he Trito ns bega n their 
springt ime competition against 
Division I school. However, 
Auburn proved to bvea bit more 
difficult than Idaho and took the 
match easily, 8-1. 

Then the Tri tons got going. 
On March 29, UCSD played 
Mills College. 

"They are a weak team," said 
Triton Head Coach Liz LaPlante. 
"They didn't give us much com· 

. petition at all ." 
The following day, Ca l State 

Stanislaus was in town and the 
Tritons cleaned up again, 8-1 . 
Christine Behrens defeated Sta· 
nislaus' freshman Lisa Minturn 
6-2, 5-7, 6-1 for the No. I seed. 
Minturn proved to be a surpris· 
ingly difficult match fo r the 
Triton's top player, having just 

come off a basketball season. 
Second seed Julie Berman 

cru ised through her match 
against Maureen Doppenberg 6-
I , 6-0. Number three player 
Rhonda Meier topped Setsuko 

day rest before facing Division 
III Luther College of Iowa. The 
Tritons won the match 6-3. 

"The match against Luther was 
another good match," LaPlante 
said . "We should have won some 

gles matches. 
In doubles, Olsen and Writ· 

tland de fe ated Behrens and 
Meier, 6-4, 6-2. Whalen and 
Mitchell took their match against 
Sarah Olsen and Tonya Tappa, 

"We are stil l recovering from a few 'lingering' injuries . .. There 
are only five weeks left before Nationals. We'll try to heal up to 
1 00 percent by then. 

Homma 6-2, 6-0. Other wins in 
the singles matches came from 
Janet Whalen, Susan Mitchell 
and Susan Carney, all in two 
straight sets. 

In doubles, the No. I team of 
Behrens and Meier lost to Min· 
turn and Doppenberg, 6-4, 2-6, 
6-7. The teams of Mitchell / Wha· 
len and Carney / Kristen Diels 
both had victories. 

After their match against Sta· 
nislaus, the Tritons had a two 

-Head Coach Liz LaPlante 
of the losses, but it was a good, 
tough match." 

Behrens suffered her first loss 
in six attempts against Division 
III players as Luther's Melanie l 
Miller took their match 6-1 , 7-6. 
Julie Berman against breezed 
through her opponent, Stacy 
Olsen, 6-0, 6-1. Rhonda Meier 
could not catch Kris Writland, 
losing 3-6, 7-5, 5-7. Mitchell, 
Whalen, and Diels, playing the 
No. 6 position, all took their sin· 

6-3, 6-3 and Diels and Carney 
won their match over Anne 
Kuello and Whitland, 6-7, 6-1 , 
6-3. 

The Tritons were finally play· 
ing with a healthy team for the 
last two matches. During the 
early season, most of the Tritons 
missed matches due to injury 
and sickness. 

"We are still recovering from a 
few 'lingering' inj uries, " La Plante 
said. "But we are looking good. 

There are only five weeks left 
before Nationals. We'll try to 
heal up to 100 percent by then." 

During those next five weeks, 
the Tritons must face Occidental 
and Claremont Colleges and will 
participate in a Menlo Division 
III tournament. Wins over these 
two teams and a good ;showing 
ill the tournament will assure 
UCSD of a spot in Nationals in 
May. (Q)

ting on his spikes? Another good 
subject for betting is exactly when 
the New York Post (if it still 
exists) runs its first Clark·is-an· 
ass·eve n·i f ·he·d oes·d ri ve· in· 
all·those·runs·piece. The start 
of the Yankees line-up is ridicu· 
lously good : Henderson; Ran· 
dolph; Mattingly; Clark; Win· 
field and Pagliarulo. On the other 
hand , they 're planning to play 
Rafael Santana every day at 
short. 

Milwaukee - The Brewers' 
proclivity for streaks is usually a 
sign of a leam about to come of 
age. For the Brewers to win, 
Juan Nieves would have to turn 
out to be as good as Teddy Higu· 
era already is. Not likely. The 
Brewers will win 85-90 games 
again and be gone by Aug. 15. 

It 's too bad, because the 
Brewers play in one of the few 
parks with real bleachers. Also, 
Yount and Molitor don't have 
much time left. 

Dan Plesac will establish him· 
self as the best relief pitcher in 
baseball and Rob Deer will play 
all year and strike out 200 times.

Gibson for Pedro Guerrero or 
Dave Winfield . Actually, a Win· 
field trade was stopped by the 
NBA Commissioner's Office, 
which decreed that Gibson in 
New York would put the Yan· 
kees over the Scumbag Cap. 

The Tigers will die unless and 
maybe even if Frank Tanana has 
one more good year left, despite 
Jack Morris ready to go out and 
win the Cy Young. Doyle Alex· 
ander is still here (did I mention 
the Scumbag Cap already?), and 
unfortunately, Willie Hernandez 
is too. Even in the unlikely event 
that Tom Henemann is actually 
ready to be a relief ace, Sparky 
Anderson will have his hands 
full managing the staff, some· 
thing he is about as good as 
anybody at doing. He is one of 
the few managers (Roger Craig 
and Whitey Herzog come to 
mind) who could win a series 
with Jack Billingham as a number 
one pitcher (see Cincinnati , 
1976-77). 

The Tigers will score, like ev· 
erybody else in this division 
except Baltimore, unless Darrell 
Evans is kidnapped by a UFO. 

Baltimore - A new, intelli· 
gently designed, outdoor stadium 
in the works and Cal Ripken, Jr. 
are what the Orioles have going 
for them. Everything else sucks. 
They have no infield around 
Ripken, no catcher, no reliable 
starting pitchers and a bullpen 
that depends on the arm of Don 
Aase, which is to say, is totally 
undependable. 

What will Cal Ripken, Jr. do 
when Cal Ripken, Sr. gets blamed 
for all this and is fired? Is Jr. the 
reason G M Hank Peters, one of 
the most widely respected base· 
ball minds around, was blamed, 
then fired instead of the usual 
managerial hatchet job? 

The Orioles are going to suck 
for year with no obvious pitch· 
ing help on the way. 

Cleveland - The only team 
here besides the Orioles that 
couldn't win the NL West going 
away. They invited over 30 
pitchers to Arizona, expecting 
that 10 would be of major league 
quality. One, Tom Candiotti, 
beats young teams such as the 
Rangers and A's like a drum . 
The rest couldn't make the AAA 
roster of Houston or the Giants. 

On the field, Cleveland has the 
best team in the division except 
for the Yankees. H ow would you 
like to have Brook Jacoby, Joe 
Carter and Julio Franco in your 
infield with Cory Snyder, Mel 
Hall, et al in the outfield? 

Watching bozos on parade on 
the mound can wear on your 
enthusiasm, however . Brett 
Butler was with the Indians in 
Oakland two years ago when the 
Deadhead bleacher contingent 
in centerfield, disgruntled with 
the looping swing·and·a·miss 
style of Dwayne Murphy, asked 
how long Butler had until free 
agency. Butler waved two fin· 
gers. This winter, he signed with 
the Giants.

LAW AND SOCIElY 
Interdl.clpllnary Mlnor/P-rOlr •• of Conc.ntratlon/Ar.a Study 

L aw and Society is an interdisciplinary program that emphasizes the complexity and interrelationship of legal. social and ethical issues in their historical context . The Law and Society minor is available to all 
UCSD students with a general interest in law as a social institution as well as 
to students considering law-related careers. The purpose of the program is to 
enhance students' critical anal¥sis of social and ethical issues related to law 
and of the legal implications and ramifications of policy and decision-making 
in their fields . To insure an interdisciplinary learning experience , students 
must include in their program at least one course from each of the following 
"core"academicdepartments: Hi.~tory, Philosophy, Political Science and Sociology. 

B ecause each college has different general education requirements (rules for non-contiguous coursework a nd rules for overlapping upper division course work), students should contact an academic 
advisor in their college to see how the Law and Society Program can best meet 
their college's general ed ucal ion requirements. Students who complete the program 
but do not use it for a minor, program of concentration or area study as part 
of the genera l education requirements. may elect to have a special notal ion on 
their transcript certifying their completion of the ,oursework.

HEALTH CARE - SOCIAL ISSUES 
Int.rdl.clpllnary Millor/Program of Conc.ntratlon/Ar •• Study 

THE HEALTH CARE-SOCIAL ISSUES PROGRAM offers students a 
variety of perspectives that enhance their ability to deal with complex 
social and ethical issues in modern health care. This program is available 
to all UCSD students with a general interest in issues related to health care 
as well as to students considering health care careers. By bringing together 
coursework from a number of academic departments. this interdisciplinary 
curriculum complements science majors and enriches students' preparation 
for professional and postgraduate education. 
THE MINOR CONSISTS of six courses, two required and four elective 
courses . At least four courses (three electives and Philosophy 122 which is 
required) must be taken at the upper-division level. Upper-division elec-
tives must be chosen from a department other than that of the student's 
major. 
BECAUSE EACH COLLEGE has different general education require-
ments (rules for non-contiguous coursework and rules for overlapping 
upper division coursework), students should contact an academic advisor 
in their college to see how the Health Care-Social Issues Program can best 
meet their college's general education requirements. Students who com-
plete the Health Care-Social Issues program but do not use it for a minor 
as part of the general education requirements, may elect to have a special 
notation on their transcript certifying their completion of the program.

Future Scripps aquarium 
site is declared safe 
By ROBERT LEONE 
Sellior St~ Writw 

Recent studies by a geological 
consulting firm show that the 
site proposed for the Stephen 
Birch Aquarium-Museum is safe 
for building according to a 
statement released by the Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography in 
March. 

A November , 1987 SIO 
statement said that J. H. Klein-
felder Associates had found evi-
dences that the site, on a hillside 
west of short-wave radio station 
WWD at SIO, was on an ancient 
landslide. 

George Shor, an associate 
director at SIO and a professor 
of marine geology, said Klein-
felder geologists examined the 
proposed site's soil and "found 
the rock there was badly broken," 
and indication of landslide act iv-

ity. When the geologists drilled 
bore holes at easily accessable 
locations on the north and east 
sides of the hill, they found "a 
clay slip layer." 

Bore holes are approximately 
four feet in diameter. Geologists 
are placed in cages and lowered 
down the hole to inspect soil and 
rock. According to the SIO 
statement, some of the holes 
drilled by Kleinfelder at the 
aquarium-museum site were 
more than 100 feet deep. 

Shor and Tom Collins, also an 
SIO associate director, said that 
clay slip layers, or slip surfaces, 
are formed by the grinding action 
of landslides. Both directors said 
the results from the initial bore 
drillings showed that the whole 
hillside was at rest on a bedrock 
plane having a six-degree slope 
toward the ocean. 

The perceived safety factor of 

the site was not very high. 
According to Collins, the safety 
factor at the site was thought to 
be 1.4, less than the 1.5 "required 
by law" to build on a site without 
strong "mitigation measures." 

However, Shor said he and 
Kleinfelder geologist Michael 
Chapin were puzzled by an

the landslide to be approximately 
100,000 years old, but felt that if 
it were that old and as unstable 
as it appeared, it should have 
already been jolted downhill by 
subsequent earthquakes. 

Kleinfelder geologists conti-
nued to research the site, drilling 
bore holes at less accessible loca-
tions on the hill, including the 
steep west side. Shor and Collins

S cripps aquaria: A brief history 
By ROBERT LEONE 
Senior StqfJ Writer 

A public aquarium has been an important part ofthe 
Scripps Institute of Oceanography (SIO) since before it 
was the Scripps Institute of Oceanography. William E. 
Ritter's summer laboratory in Coronado back in 1892 
included a few display tanks for the benefit of visitors. 
"To build and maintain a public aquarium" was in the 
Marine Biological Association of San Diego's charter. 

In 1915, eight years after SIO's current site was pur-
chased, the first dedicated aquarium building, a "tem-
porary" wooden structure, was constructed. Percy S . 
Barnhard was the curator. In 1935 its register was 
signed by 5,306 visitors. Barnhard, who had been plan-
ning a new building for decades, retired in 1946. 

His replacement, Sam Hinton, pushed through 
Barnhard 's dream. In October of 1950, the Thomas 
Wayland Vaughan Aquarium-Museum was completed 
and occupied, though it wasn't dedicated until 1951. 
Vaughan was SIO's second director. 

The current curator, Don Wilkie, assumed his post in 
1965. Wilkie, a former schoolteacher, began the SID 
volunteer docent program in 1966. The docents teach 
basic oceanography to visiting school groups ranging 
from kindergarten students to college scholars. 

Pat Kampmann, who currently runs the aquarium-
museum's volunter docent program, said that last year 
more than 300,000 people visited Vaughan Hall, adding 
that 45,000 of these people were in school groups on 
field trips. Robert Leonel Guardian 

The planned Stephen Birch Aquarium-Museum, 
named after a prominent contributor, will be a two-level 
concrete and glass building with approximately three-and-
a-half times that floor space of the current facility . [Q]

Good speakers 
feel no fear 
By DAVID ONG 

DA VIS - The idea of speaking before a group triggers more fear 
in some people than death, snakes or heights. But understanding the 
reasons behind speech anxiety can help control it , said Michael T. 
Motley, chairman of the Department of Rhetoric and Communica-
tion at the University of California , Davis. 

One of the most common causes of speech anxiety is the tendency 
to regard public speeches as performances, a view that almost gua-
rantees a nerve-wracking experience, Motley said . 

Motley devotes much of his efforts to persuading his clients to 
consider speeches as communication rather than performances, 
occasions that call for speech normally used in everyday conversation. 

The familiar physical symptoms of speech anxiety - sweaty 
palms, increased heart rate, dry mouth, shortness of breath and 
butterflies in the stomach - are normal and strike everyone, includ-
ing the most confident speakers, Motley said . 

However, confident speakers see those signs as a positive indica-
tion that they are emotionally ready for the speech, while most 
people interpret the feeings as fear. They imagine being shamed, 
embarassed or ridiculed. 

But, Motley said , this kind of thinking typified the notion that 
speeches must be performances, delivered in an artificial, formal 
manner. 

A performance implies the desire for a positive evaluation from an 
audience, and research has shown that the prospect of being evalu-
ated arouses anxiety in almost any situation. 

Motley urges his clients to concentrate instead on communicating, 
by speaking the way they do in casual conversation. 

Motley sees speech anxiety occurring in three stages. In the first 
two phases - anticipation in the few minutes before the speech, and 
the actual start of the speech - heart rates exceed the normal range. 

The final phase, unfamiliar to many speakers, is actually a lower-
ing ofthe heart rate that occurs shortly after the speech begins, within 
30 seconds. Preliminary studies have shown that speakers who are 
aware of this phase can make it happen sooner, by telling themselves 
they are feeling less stress. 

Motley said that, as in any therapy, the goal is not the complete 
elimination of anxiety. 

"A speaker's aim should be to keep this natural nervousness from 
cycling out of control: not to get rid of the butterflies but to make 
them fly in formation." (Q]

The Other George Bush 
Continued from pale 5 
living voice of Bobby Kennedy 
in American politics today." 

"No," I said. "Don't tell me 
that swill . It 's too horrible. I 
depend on you for more than 
that." 

I laughed. It was crazy. Here 
was Gene Skinner one of the 
meanest and most cynical hit 
men in polities telling me that 
he'd spend the last two nights 
arguing with George Bush about 
the true meaning of Plato's 
Republic and the Parable of the 
Caves, smoking Djarum cigar-
ettes and weeping distractedly 
while they kept playing and 
replaying old Leonard Cohen 
tunes on his old Nakamichi tape 
machine. 

"Yeah" Skinner said, "he still 
carries that 350 with the Halli-
burton case, the one h"'~ carried 
for years .. . He loves music, really 
high rock 'n' roll. He has ta pes of 
Alice Stuart that he made himself 
on the Nak." 

Ye Gods, I thought. They've 
fmally turned him; he's gone 
belly-up. How did he get my 
phone number? 

"You hideous punk! Don't call 
me any more!" I yelled at him. 
"I'm moving to Hawaii next 
week. I know where you've been 
for the last two years. Stay away 
from me!" 

"You foo!!" he shouted . 
"Where were you when we were 
looking for you in New Orleans 
last week? We hung around for 
three days. George wanted to 
hook up with the Neville Broth-
ers. We were traveling incognito." 
And now he was telling that 
Bush - half mad on cheap gin 
and hubris, with 16 states already 
locked up on Super Tuesday -
showed up at the New Orleans 
airport on Sunday night with 
only one bodyguard and a black 
928 Porsche with smoked win-
dows and Argentine license 
plates. 

I t was hard to accept. Skinner was a professional, I knew, and Bush was a former direc-
tor of the CIA. It was a strange 
mix: and especially strange, given 
Skinner's bizarre fix on Bush, 
which made me very uneasy. 
"Y ou know why he likes me?" he 
said. "He likes me because I 
know poems. He loves poetry. 
He can do Annabel Lee from top 
to bottom." At that point his 
voice got blurry. 

"It was many and many a year 
ago, in a kingdom by the sea . . . " 

He paused for a minute, then 
went on in a very dreamy voice, 
which disturbed me. "And this 
maiden she lived with no other 
thought than to love and be 
loved by me ... I was a child and 
she was a child in this kingdom 
by the sea: But we loved with a 
love that was more than love . .... 

"That's enough," I said. "I 
can't stand it. The idea of George 
Bush cruising around New Or-
leans and quoting the works of 
Edgar Allen Poe is more than I 
can handle." 

"That's nothing," Skinner re-
plied. "He can sing every song 
that Bob Dylan ever wrote. He 
plays the Dobro. He has the 
second Dobro ever made in its 
original case. Incredible, incre-
dible. " 

I laughed harshly, but he 
seemed not to notice. 

"And he loves animals," Skin-
ner said. "Animals are the only 
thing he loves more than music. 

"I saw him rescue a dead cat 
and try to bring it back to life," 
he said, "right out in the middle 
of Pennsylvania Avenue. He put 
his head right down on that 
animal's lips and blew his own 
breath down its throat ... People 
hooted and cheered at him, and a 
big crowd gathered, but he kept 
right on." 

I felt sick and said nothing. Skinner rambled on, drifted from one demented story to 
another,like he was talking about 
the Maharishi. It made no sense 
at all. 

None of it did, for that matter. 
George Bush was a mean crook 
from Texas. He had no friends, 
and nobody in Washington 
wanted to be seen with him on 
the streets at night. There was 
something queasy about him, 
they said - a sense of something 
grown back into itself, like a 
dead animal. .. It was impossible 
that he could be roaming around 
Washington or New Orleans at 
night, jabbering Dylan Thomas 
and pickin~ up dead cats. 

There was something very 
wrong about it - deeply wrong, 
even queer . .. Yet Skinner seemed 
to believe these things, and he 
wanted me to believe them. 

Why? It was like-hearing that 
Ivan Boesky and written "The 
Rime of the Ancient Mariner. ~ 
or that Ed Meese wakes up every 
morning and hurls a $100 bill 
across the Potomac. 

I hung up the phone and felt 
crazy. Then I walked back to the 
hotel in the rain.

"The slide forms more a bowl 
than a plane," Shor said. The 
west edge of the slip plane 
appeared to be about 50 feet 
higher than projected . This 
means the old landslide is much 
less likely to move downhill in 
the future. Collins said the safety 
factor at the site is 2.5 or greater. 

Kleinfelder geologist Chapin 
said ,"We have given the Univer": 
sity the go-ahead to construct on 
the site." However, because the 

rock and soil underneath the site 
is disturbed and cracked, Chapin 
cautions that five feet of soil 
underneath the building site 
should be dug up and compacted. 
This is to prevent damage from 
uneven ground subsidence. 

Boone Hellman , Acting 
As'sistant Vice Chancellor for 
Design and Construction, and 
other sources within Design and 
Construction said that soil com-
paction is a fairly routine con-
structrol1 operation. "We con't 
anticipate the expense to be sub-
stantial," Hellman said. "We're 
estimating it's [the compacted 
earth] going to cost under 
$100,000," Collins said. 

According to Cindy Clark of 

the SIO Public Affairs Office, 
the construction of the new 
building is being funded entirely 
by voluntary contributions. 
Already raised is $7.6 million. 
The fund raising goal is 58.2 
million. 

The proposed site of the new 
aquarium-museum is on the top 
and west slope of a hill crested by 
SID Marine Radio Station 
WWD and its antennae. 

The entire hill is thought to 
have been part ofthe mesa where 
the Mesa Apartments are located 
before it (the hill) slid to its pres-
ent location . The hill is part of 
the 170 acres of San Diego 
pueblo lands bought in 1907. 1Q)

However, the final contracts with

to the University Center building

The incomplete Price Center 
was featured in the November 
issue of "American School and

not win any awards , how-

He said that the A.S. is recep-

efforts for more diverse pro-
gramming reflects their com-

represents. 

Programming Board are of vary-
ing cultural backgrounds and 
that a diverse committee can be 
of great help in deciding what is

Assistant Vice Chancellor Tommy Tucker worried about the Jerus-
alem stone arriving on time, 

There have been some design 
changes in the University Cen-
ter. The information desk now 
juts onto the center's internal 
plaza, making the information 
staff more accessible. A lounge 
next to a grou!) of six conference 
rooms on the second floor will 
replace an administrative office. 
"It creates better circulation -for 
the people using the conference 
rooms," Carruthers said. The 
new lounge is also near the loca-

of setting guidelines. The board 
is, however, currently in opera-

Both Marchick and Devers said

OPINION 

Football Editorial Unfair 
Continued from pall! 4 
intramurals." Why does foothall 
change thjs? Intra murals will 
continue to be an integral part of 
campus life. This is made clear 
by construction of the new sports 
complex, which will provide 
intramurals with much needed 
space for continued growth. 
Football will not hamper this; 
nor will it negatively impact the 
existing intercollegiate sports. 

Yet another problem with the 
article is the negative comments 
made about various members of 
the UCSD population . The 
"crowd turnout of 12 and the 
boycott by perky cheerleaders" 
remark was uncalled for. The 
UCSD cheerleaders have been 
present at more games, including 
every men's basketball contest, 
than any other student group at 
UCSD this year, and in addition 
hold regular practices. None of 
this is required, so the cheerlead-
ers would hardly be inclined to 
"boycott" any athletic event, nor 
is it likely that only 12 fans 
would be in the stands at football 
games. 

The "drunken butts on wooden 
bleachers" comment, besides 
negatively stereotyping all foot-
ball fans and sports fans in 
general, is another ridiculous 
statement. Those "butts" can just 
as easily frequent basketball , 
baseball , softball , water polo, 
and other athletic contests which 
are held on our campus through-
out the school year. yet there 
have been no incidents of aleo-

hoi abuse among fans at any 
intercollegiate game in the two 
years I have been involved with 
the athletic department . At 
UCSD, alcohol is not sold at 
sporting events anyway, nor are 
containers allowed into games. 
Where is the evidence that foot-
ball would generate problems 
such as this? 

Finally, the closing remark of 
the column, suggesting that the 
A.S. "kill the initiative now, or 
that students prepare to hear 
more numbing rah-rah propa-
ganda about 'school spirit.' "was 
a crock. 

First. why shouldn't the stu-
dents themselves be given the 
option of voting on the issue? It 
certainly seems to be a hot topic, 
jUdging by the coverage the 
Guardian has accorded it lately. 

Second . since when is the idea 
of having pride in your school 
and showing spirit for your 
school's teams "numbing rah-
rah propaganda?" The Guardian 
may be an advocate of student 
apathy, but to call schools spirit 
"numbing propaganda" is ludi-
crous. The excitement and energy 
generated by a full gym rooting 
for the home team is a tremend-
ous experience for those in 
attendance, yet this spirit is being 
ridiculed by the Guardian. 

Why is it that hundreds of col-
leges and universities across the 
nation have strong athletic pro-
grams with vibrant student sup-
port, while the Guardian opposes 
such an atmosphere at UCSD? 

Many of the complaints about 
the lack of social life at UCSD 
are not heard at other universi-
ties, where students actively 
support their athletic teams and 
have fun doing so. This is not 
limited to the less esteemed insti-
tutions, either, as schools like 
Stanford. Cal, UCLA, the Ivy 
League schools, and many other 
have shown in NCAA Division 
I, II and III competition. 

In recent weeks there has been 
a marked increase in interest for 
athletics shown by the A.S. 
Council and the student body, 
something which Froups such as 
the Triton Waves, the Pep Band, 
the cheerleaders and the athletes 
are working hard to promote. 
Why squelch such work with 
negative, uninformed "journal-
ism" when it can increase the 
interest of students not only in 
sports and the college experience, 
but also install some pride in 
being a member of the UCSD 
community? 

I would hope the Guardian 
would be the first to acknowl-
edge that everyone is entitled to 
an opinion on this issue. A vote 

Writ,. 
Letter 

To Your 
NewspllpD 

p". 

is the best way to determine the 
consensus. and the student body 
should not be deprived of that 
process.

the future. Saxle, Marshall, Pedro, and Klrkle 
can hit a little, but who is going 10 catch and 
throw the ball? Dodger pitchers are ready to 
firebomb Fred Claire's office as soon as the 
':lew' Dodgers turn routine groundball&. into 
a day at Disneyland. 

Folks, you don't want to miss the opener. 
And Campus rec at the U is right on top of it. 
We've got 100 Plaza Level tickets for Open-
ing Night , Tuesday Apnl 12 at the Murph! 

Tickets are S8.50 per and can be ob-
tained at the Canyonview Recreation Office 
during bUSiness hours (8 am-5 pm). A B-Y-
O-B tailgate will be held at Section G2 
beginning as soon as class gets out Tues-
day afternoon!
