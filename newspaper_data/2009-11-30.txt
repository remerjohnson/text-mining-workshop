The Associated Students could soon see roughly 
$140,000 in debt accumulated by the Grove Cafe 
reflected on their annual operating budget. Though 
the Student Affairs Office has absorbed the debt gen-
erated by the eatery for the last several years, university 
officials recently initiated an effort to clear the deficit 
from their expenses.

According to Student Life Business Director John 
Hughes, Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Penny 
Rue’s office recently requested that his department 
identify any long-running deficits within its operating 
expenses.

Hughes said the debt accrued by the Grove Cafe, as 
well as a similar amount hanging over Cafe Vita — the 
Graduate Student Association’s own coffee house in 
east campus — immediately caught his attention.

“When the university examines its budget and 
looks at its negative deficits, things like the Grove Cafe 
jump off the page,” Hughes said. 

According to Hughes, Student Life Director of 
Finances Dawn Buttrell asked that he explore ways to 
remedy the outstanding deficits. Earlier this month, 
Hughes met with A.S. President Utsav Gupta to dis-
cuss transferring the Grove’s debt from the university’s 
budget to that of the A.S. Council.

Hughes said both the undergraduate council and 
the GSA would be able to absorb the deficits accrued 
by their coffee shops without difficulty, given the 
scope of their financial resources.

“A.S. and GSA are sitting on large reserves, rela-
tively speaking,” Hughes said. “So the vice chancellor’s 
office is saying, ‘Why don’t you just move that deficit 
to your own budget?’”

Student Affairs Office looks to cut 
Grove Cafe, GSA debt from its 
financial baggage.

After 15 years of planning, con-
struction finally began last month to 
turn the fourth slice of “Wedge” lot 
— 82,000 square feet of open space 
in Eleanor Roosevelt College — into 
a sustainable park area.

The site attracted the attention of 
student environmentalists last year 
when the university proposed to turn 
the space — located just east of North 
Torrey Pines Rd. — into a parking 
lot. Organizations like Greeks Gone

See WEDGE��page 7Students chalked tallies on Ridge Walk last week to demonstrate the impact of the UC Board of Regents’ Nov. 19 fee increase.

A fter a hectic finals week, college students can turn from Red Bull and Rockstar to a weekend 
alternative: Energy drinks like 
Four and Joose are infused with 
up to 12-percent alcohol, so that 
reaching the 4 a.m. mark can 
be a breeze. However, the half-
decade old product — a popular 
and toxic combination — may 
soon be banned.

The Food and Drug 
Administration requested evi-

dence on Nov. 13 
from all compa-
nies that produce 
alcopop energy 
drinks — which 
also include 3AM 
Vodka and Liquid 

Charge — that their products are 
unharmful to consumers.

The FDA has never deemed 
caffeine safe in any amount 
when mixed with alcoholic 
beverages. Under the Federal 
Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act 
of 1938, any substance added 
to food is considered unsafe 
and unlawful until is has been 
approved by FDA regulation, 
and is subject to prior sanction 
before it can be stamped as 
Generally Recognized As Safe.

The FDA said in a press 
release that it was unaware of 
any existing GRAS under which 
the beverage would be deemed 
legal. If alcoholic energy-drink 
drink producers fail to provide 
evidence of either sanctions, the 
FDA will deem their beverages 
illegal and halt all sales.  

However, a task force con-
sisting of 18 attorney generals 
from states including California 
and New York — along with 
the San Francisco city attorney 
— are encouraging the FDA to 
inspect the combination further.

“There is a strong emerging 
consensus of scientific opinion

that the combination of caf-
feine and alcohol … poses a 
serious public health risk,” task 
force members said in a letter 
to the FDA on Sept. 25.

Members also recognized 
that the drink’s stimulants — 
which often include taurine, 
ginsing and guarana in addi-
tion to caffeine — can reduce 
self-awareness of being drunk, 
which could lead to an increase 
in driving under the influence, 
sexual assault and other alco-
hol-related crimes.

“You do feel like you’re 
sober when you’ve been drink-
ing energy drinks and alcohol 
— even when you’re drunk,” 
Eleanor Roosevelt College 
sophomore Linda Suh said.

According to the FDA sta-
tistics, U.S. college students 
tend to combine caffeine and 
alcohol 26 percent of the times 
that they choose to drink.

and energy drinks at parties,”

Research conducted by a UCSD 
professor has revealed the presence 
of heart disease in Egyptian mummy 
remains, disproving the common 
theory that heart disease is a new 
occurrence caused by unhealthy 
modern lifestyles. 

Michael Miyamoto, a doctor at 
the UCSD School of Medicine,  jour-
neyed to Cairo, Egypt in February 

2009 as part of a team of scientists 
that analyzed the remains of 22 
mummies taken from the Egyptian 
National Museum of Antiquities. 
The mummies dated from 1981 B.C. 
to A.D. 334 and, on average, were 
age 45 when they died. 

“The mummies were selected 
based on how well preserved they 
were, carried to trailers around the 
rear of the museum and then later 
collected and reviewed [for] infor-
mation,” Miyamoto said. 

Using computed axial tomogra-
phy scans, the team discovered that 
16 of the 22 mummies showed the 
presence of calcium within the soft 
tissues deposited in blood vessels. 
Nine of the 16 had blood vessels 
containing calcified plaque, which is 
a indicator of a form of heart disease 
now known as atherosclerosis, or 
hardening of the arteries. However, 
the presence of plaque was not dis-
covered within the major coronary 
arteries such as the aorta. 

The finding disproved the prior 
notion that heart disease was purely 
the result of activities such as smok-
ing and an unhealthy lifestyle. The 
discovery of heart disease in ancient 
remains opens the possibility that 
humans have a genetic predisposi-
tion for heart disease, although 
Miyamoto said that an unhealthy 
lifestyle may still have contributed to 
the atherosclerosis.

NEWS� MONDAY, NOVEMBER 30, 2009� THE UCSD GUARDIAN 3 

The A.S. Council manages a total 
operating budget of over $3.1 mil-
lion each year, the majority of which 
is derived from a quarterly student 
activity fee. Additionally, the council 
possesses a reserve fund of roughly 
$1 million.

“It’s a pretty logical choice for [the 
university] to ask us to bear the bur-
den of our own debt,” Gupta said. 

The A.S. Council and the GSA 
both operate as university depart-
ments. Much of their finances are 
managed by the university, including 
payroll for A.S. and GSA staff mem-
bers and long-term financial invest-
ments, which are carried out by the 
UC Office of the President.

Their department status also ren-

ders all debts accrued by certain A.S. 
and GSA enterprises the immediate 
financial responsibility of the univer-
sity. Though the Grove Cafe is techni-
cally owned and operated by the A.S. 
Council, the eatery’s sizeable debt is 
not currently reflected in the council’s 
budget. Instead, it is reflected in a uni-
versity account.

According to Hughes, the univer-
sity is willing to support departmental 
debts to a certain extent, but these 
deficits eventually begin to yield nega-
tive financial repercussions for the 
university if they are allowed to grow 
too large.

This concern arises specifically 
when considering the university’s 
Short Term Investment Pool — a pro-
gram through which UCOP financial 

managers annually invest departmen-
tal revenue from each campus, then 
transfer two percent of any returns 
back to the departments. When the 
university carries deficits — such as 
those of the Grove Cafe and Cafe Vita 
— they reflect negatively on depart-
mental STIP returns. 

According to Hughes, by main-
taining a Grove deficit on its budget, 
the Student Affairs Office loses rough-
ly $2,800 each year in STIP funds. 
Though the figure is relatively small 
in comparison to the university’s total 
operating budget, Hughes said clear-
ing the budget of deficits is simply 
good bookkeeping. 

Gupta said he believes the uni-

I’ve never considered myself the cooking type. Before picking up this column gig, tossing around 
a pigskin was the closest I’d come to 
handling cured meat. 

But making a meal from scratch 
for a hot date still seemed an appro-
priate gesture from the sort of accom-
plished young man I pretend to be 
(you know, the kind of guy you take 
to a family dinner, and that your 
grandma can hug). With visions of 
being that pseudo-sophisticated boy-
friend, I pulled on my argyle sweater 
and hopped online to peruse a selec-
tion of romantic recipes. 

Who, you ask, was the intended 
recipient of my culinary spoils? 
We’ll call her Paula — a girl I was 
introduced to through a high-
school friend. OK, so it was a blind 
date. Luckily, she passed the initial 
Facebook screening. From what I 
learned from our mutual friend and 
her profile, she had just returned from 
a semester of teaching English in Peru 
— meaning, of course, that she was 
a cosmopolitan lady with a cultured 
palate. 

Now, to impress her with my 
feigned mastery of world cuisine. In 
order to accommodate my fledgling 
abilities in the kitchen, the dish need-
ed to be complex in taste yet simple in 
preparation. With the given criteria, 
I decided to make aji de gallina — a 
dish Paula must have known well after 
her time in Peru. Aji de gallina, simply 
put, is chicken in a cream sauce. Its 
basic ingredients are skinless chicken 
breast, coarsely chopped onion, 
chopped carrots, garlic cloves, white 
bread, Parmesan cheese, walnuts, 
ground turmeric, eggs, milk and the 
requisite aji amarillo chili paste. List in 
hand, I headed down to Whole Foods 
Market (nothing says “cultured young 

gentleman” like over-
priced free-range 
chicken) to gather 
the ingredients for 
my swoon-worthy 
entree. 

 Three hours 
before Paula’s 
anticipated arrival, I 
started in on the aji 

de gallina. First, I placed the chicken, 
onions, carrots and garlic in a large 
saucepan and brought them to a 
simmer with a bit of water. Once it 
began to really crackle, I skimmed the 
foam off the top, reduced the heat, 
covered the pan and let the chicken 
continue to simmer until tender. Then 
I removed the chicken from the pan 
and let it cool on a plate. 

I strained the chicken stock, 
removed the vegetables and put them 
in a blender with cubed pieces of 
white bread and milk. 

After blending until smooth, I 
added the walnuts and Parmesan 
cheese and again pureed in a cream. 

Once the chicken cooled, I shred-
ded it and discarded the bones. (After 
it’s boiled, chicken shreds pretty eas-
ily — even for me). Then I heated 
the vegetables in a separate saucepan, 
adding minced garlic and onions. I 
stirred until the garlic appeared trans-

NATIONAL NEWS —  Last week, the Food and 
Drug Administration sent a group of alcoholic-
energy-drink producers a hostile warning: 
either prove their efficient beverages harmless 
within 30 days or face product discontinuation. 

But before the FDA adopts such a righteous 
approach to the caffeine-plus-alcohol buzz, it 
should consider the craftiness of the product’s 
No. 1 fans.

Not to mention the logical sore thumb in this 
situation: If the FDA were to ask all the alcoholic 
beverage and tobacco companies in the country 
for proof that their products were harmless, we’d 
be facing Prohibition: Part Two in 30 days flat.

Then there’s the fact that mixing depressants 
like alcohol with stimulants like caffeine isn’t 
a novel concept. We’ve been Irishing up our 
coffee far too long for the FDA to label the alco-
holic energy drink a concerning new craze.

The FDA wants to eliminate fizzy fruit-
flavored beverages like Joose — which contains 
about 4 percent more alcohol than your aver-
age Budweiser — for two reasons: They make 
people feel less impaired than they actually 
are, and those people are usually young. And, 
though this might be a farfetched assumption, 
it’s likely FDA officials don’t think young people 
can handle their shit. 

For the most part, the FDA’s right; young 
people are serious drinkers. According to a 2008 
study from the National Institute on Alcohol 
Abuse and Alcoholism, adults aged 18 to 24 
are the most likely to participate in “high risk” 
drinking — something you could have inferred 
yourself after a highly vomitous freshman year.

 And it seems like any beverage that tastes 
like grape soda has a pretty sweet Von-Dutch 
rip-off aesthetic and — most importantly — 
will get you twice as drunk as Bud Light must 
be stopped, for the sake of the children. Except 

Uninvited to the Obamas’ first State Dinner, crafty couple Tareq and Michaele Salahis squeezed past security in hopes of achieving quick reality-star fame. 
After lucking their way through Secret Service security measures, the “Real Housewives” hopefuls hilariously rubbed elbows with most prominent political 
figures in the country — including Barack and Michelle themselves. But can we just dismiss this trespass as a harmless publicity stunt?   

The Salahis’ tacky breach of White House security is certainly cause for 
alarm. But in this particular case, we can 
only roll our eyes at the amount of media 
attention being projected onto another 
fame-starved housewife, and move on. 

Consider who is truly culpable in the 
situation — one single, blundering, missing 
security guard holding the event’s official 
guest list. He wasn’t there to differentiate 
between the chest-hugging cocktail dress 
of the particular cougar who was actually 
welcome at the event and Michaele Salahi’s 
slinky red sari. So why not just fire the 
lackey and get on with our lives?

Whether or not the media continues 
to squeeze the life out of Security-Breach 
Barbie, it’s guaranteed the Secret Service 
won’t be letting any more trespassers breeze 
past the White House gates. So, let’s forget 
the security goof and get back to the world 
of real problems being relegated to page two.

— Kelsey Marrujo
Senior Staff Writer

Last Tuesday’s average-Joe White House intrusion may have pointed out potential 
for disaster, but it boils down to little more 
than a harmless and lighthearted publicity 
stunt. 

By muscling their way into a state dinner, 
Michaele and Tareq Salahi were only taking 
desperate measures to earn their 15 minutes 
of fame — and to shop their story out to 
the highest bidder (to the ludicrous tune of 
$500,000).

In the words of the couple’s own attorney, 
Paul Morrison: “They just went to a party. 
They didn’t do anything wrong.”

Though Morrison’s judgment is question-
able (the U.S. Constitution may not explic-
itly forbid party-crashing, but in this case, 
it’s kind of a no-brainer), the Salahi couple 
had no extremist political agenda to fulfill 
— only a prized spot on the Bravo network’s 
“Real Housewives of DC.”That just makes 
them cooler than you.

— Cheryl Hori
Associate Opinion Editor

It’s tempting to dismiss the Salahi case as two forgettable limelight-seekers striving to 
fit the deranged reality-star mold — but if a 
pair of airheads could pull it off, imagine what 
someone could do with a real plan of attack.  

Even though the couple’s sneaky entry into 
the White House could be blamed on simple 
human error (even with stealthy headsets, 
Secret Service agents are, after all, still just 
people), when it comes the safety of the rulers 
of the free world, there’s no room for mistakes. 

As the first African American president 
in U.S. history, President Barack Obama faces 
massive danger — in fact, according to CNN, 
since he took office, presidential death threats 
have risen 400 percent. It may not have been a 
crime for the Salahis to strut their way into the 
Oval Office, but it’s inexcusable that anyone 
fortunate enough not to be halted by a guest-
listing doorman could get through the rest of 
security without so much as a “Have a nice 
evening.”

PART 3 It was Spring Break at Daytona 
Beach.  I was lying on the beach, enjoying the 

sun’s rays and a happy buzz from some brew.  I 
was 20 years old, a junior at Davidson College in 

North Carolina.  A song by “The Turtles” came on the 
radio, and I laughed with joy as they crooned their tune:  “So 
happy together, how is the weather…”.  For some reason those 
words struck me funny.  “So happy together”, seemingly sincere 
words to one genuinely cared about.  Then, “how is the 
weather?”, which sounds so trite and shallow.  I laughed because 
the two swings, from apparent sincerity and depth to 
superficiality and triviality, typified my life.  I was living life like it 
was an absurd silly game, drinking and partying, living the wild 
life, no purpose, no goals.  I wasn’t a Wild Life major 
academically, but certainly was socially.  Suddenly, as I listened 
to the music, my mood changed dramatically, from 
contentedness with the meaninglessness of my life, to alarm 
about the same.  It was an awakening of sorts that set me on a 
quest.  I made a decision that day on the beach: “There must be 
a meaning to life, and I intend to find it.”  

The words of Jesus came to my mind, “I am the Light of the 
world.  Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will 
have the light of life” (John 8:12 NIV).  Those words greatly 
intrigued me.  Was Jesus crazy, delusional?  Was He a legend 
created by overzealous followers?  Or was He God in flesh, Truth 
incarnate, grounded in a Truth I had never experienced before?  
Back at college, I signed up for a course the next semester 
entitled, The Life and Ministry of Jesus, taught by an agnostic.  
As I read the books and the gospels, I became utterly amazed at 
the Person of Jesus.  Although at that time I did not believe in the 
reported miracles or in His resurrection from the dead, still I was 
drawn to Him as the most intriguing and amazing person I had 
ever known about.  His power, His authority – never used for His 
own benefit; His love and identification with the least, the last, 
the lost, the lonely, the “losers”;  His authenticity, genuineness, 
confidence in who He was and what His life was about; His 
teachings, His heart, His passion.  The more I read, the more 
excited I became.  “Jesus is amazing…Jesus is AMAZING!!!”   I 
became obsessed, in a positive and exciting sense, in my quest 
to learn all I could about Him.  I felt like a man in the desert, 
looking for water –and I could see what looked like a wonderful 
oasis.  But could it be a mirage?  I had to know – “Is Jesus Christ 
a mirage, or is He the REAL THING?  

It was three days into Christmas break my senior year at college.  
I had stayed over to work on a paper about Jesus.  I remember 
reading something like this in one book: “Jesus wasn’t saying to 
believe this creed or that set of ethics.  He was saying, ‘Give me 
your life!  Follow me, Either – Or, Yes or No, paint or get off the 
ladder!’”   My heart responded and I poured out all my pent up 
feelings and thoughts.  “Yes! Yes, Jesus – I want to follow You, I 
want to be like You.  You are my Hero…  Yes!  Yes!  Yes!”   At that 
point an amazing thing happened, something that completely 
changed my life.  A veil in the spiritual realm was lifted, and God’s 
love powerfully engulfed me.  I felt an incredible sense that I was 
known and cared for by an infinite, personal Spiritual Being.  
“God is!  Life matters!  It has meaning!  There is a purpose for 
my life!”  I wept on and off for days.  Jesus revealed Himself to 
me, personally -- to my heart, my mind, and my spirit.

I believe that if God did that for me, He will do that for you.  If 
He loves me, He loves you.  If He created me and has a purpose 
for my life, He created you and has a purpose for your life.  Some 
believe we can create our own reality, at least in the spiritual 
realm, and that all our ideas and beliefs are equally valid.  But 
God either exists or He doesn’t, regardless of what you or I 
believe about it.  Let me close with a question to you:  If God 
exists, and if He reveals Himself to you in a way that is 
unmistakable to you, are you willing to accept Him?  If Jesus 
Christ is God incarnate, the hope of the world, do you want to 
know it and will you follow Him?

Dear Editor,
I am writing in response to the 

inclusion of the “Best Mini Coffee” in 
the Guardian’s Nov. 19 issue. In full 
disclosure, I am a columnist for San 
Diego CityBeat, which just ran its own 
“Best of” issue, and I’m also married 
to one of the owners of the Art of 
Espresso. 

I find it perplexing that you chose 
to include a biting, juvenile review of 
the Art of Espresso under the “Best 
of” stamp. Hello, editors? Did you 
take the day off when Chris Kokiousis 
turned in his work? The author clearly 
thinks he was being edgy and smart 
in his commentary, but he really only 
served to up his own “douche factor” 
with his backbiting blurb. 

Perhaps he was aiming to diss 
the Art of Espresso, but instead he 
insulted Art of Espresso customers 
— the faculty, staff and student 
“assholes” who frequent it — simply 
for carrying an eight-ounce “I’m a 
dick” cup of coffee. (Incidentally, 
eight ounces is the proper size of a 
traditional cappuccino.) I can only 
assume you went to press before the 
announcement that student “assholes” 
will be paying 32 percent more for 
tuition next year. But your writer had 
to have been aware that the “assholes” 

comprising the faculty and staff 
have been hit in the pocketbook by 
furloughs. Not everyone on campus 
has the financial ability to purchase 
expensive coffee drinks, and the Art 
of Espresso recognizes this. They go 
to great lengths to keep costs low 
without compromising quality or 
service; certainly, you won’t find the 
honor-system basket on every counter 
in the city. 

People buy their coffee — mini or 
otherwise — at the Art of Espresso  
not because they want to offer a 
“midget middle finger to conformity” 
(though that sure is a cute bit of 
writing trickery). They go there 
because the product is good and 
consistent, the service is personable 
and the prices are low. Those are the 
qualities that should be enumerated in 
a “Best of” issue.

lucent, then added the chicken and 
aji amarillo until the dish heated 
through. Finally, I threw in the bread 
puree and cooked it until hot, sea-
soning with turmeric along the way. 

The divine taste of a 
dish, of course, is only a 
minor detail when it comes 
to blind-date strategy. Both 
my personal presentation 
— and also the dish’s — 
were of utmost importance. 
I placed the burnt-orange 
aji de gallina in a matching 
bowl and served it next to 
some rice and hard-boiled 
egg. 

As for myself, I settled 
on a striped brown-and-
orange sweater over pressed 
khakis, complementing 
the colors of the main 
dish without creating the 
illusion that my outfit 
was inspired by a creamy 
chicken breast. 

Smooth.
One heavy knock later, 

Paula had arrived with a bottle of 
wine. Unfortunately — despite her 

best efforts — the wine, dinner 
and my awesome sweater were the 
only consolations of the night. I 
thought that preparing a Peruvian 
dish would be a nice ice-breaker in 

a typically awkward situ-
ation. However, the dish 
selection only served to 
remind her of her first time 
trying aji de gallina, when 
she began a fling with a 
strapping young lad called 
Paolo — who, by the end of 
the night, I came to know 
far too much about. (Turns 
out he gave her the real 
authentic South American 
experience.) 

Now, thanks to Paula 
(and Paolo), I at least know 
it’s best to hold off on the 
dinner-at-home invite until 
the third or fourth date, 
after you’ve confirmed that 
there’s at least some sem-
blance of chemistry at each 
end of the dinner table. 

As for my next blind 
date, Domino’s and a 12-pack of PBR 
should do the trick. 

A DROP FROM THE INKWELL By Priscilla Lázaro

that banning alcoholic energy drinks 
overlooks one detail: There’s still noth-
ing to stop us wily college kids — or 
any old bartender, for that matter — 
from mixing Red Bull with Smirnoff 
and calling it a night.

One of youth’s favorite activities is 
breaking petty laws — downloading 
trilogies, stealing eye drops, smoking 
the reefer, speeding, owning ferrets — 
you name it. So what’s to stop us from 
brewing our own Four Loko-inspired, 
modern day moonshine? We’re just a 
hop, skip and a Rockstar away from 
rocket-charged jungle juice.

Banning alcoholic energy drinks 
because they’re marketed to young 
people follows the same logic as 
eliminating Victoria Secret’s Pink 
line because it encourages underage 
girls to have sex. It assumes the worst 
about the product without placing 
responsibility in the hands of the sin-
ner. 

If FDA officials respected every-
one’s god-given right to make poor 
health choices — not just crusty, whis-
key-sipping chain smokers’ — they’d 
get out the party and stop threatening 
to dry up our Joose supply.

But since they’ve already sent 
out an official warning, the FDA 
should at least do something use-
ful with its power. Why not slap a 
Surgeon General’s warning on every 
can, warning against the effects of 
combining alcohol and caffeine (and 
add a fat sales tax to boot). A higher 
price might encourage some Four 
fans to settle for Natural Light, and 
the money collected from all those 
already hooked on alcoholic energy 
drinks could go toward youth-targeted 
drunk-driving prevention programs 
like Every 15 Minutes. Or hey, maybe 
all that drunk pocket change could 
save the future of the University of 
California. Anything would be better 
than sweeping the whole mess under 
the rug with all those other forbidden 
things we still use.

Also, avoiding a complete ban of 
the beverage would allow the FDA to 
influence ingredients and alcoholic 
content — regulations that would fall 
to the wayside once students mix their 
own shoddy home-brews.

It’s about time our government got 
realistic about all the sinful tempta-
tions in this world. Kids have sex. 
They smoke pot. And they drink 
Joose. It’s all a matter of guiding — 
not forcing — us to practice healthy 
behavior. And even if educating our 
generation seems like a lost cause, at 
the very least they could save up to 
impart some wisdom on the next one.

versity is moving to shore up its 
expenses due to the systemwide 
budget crisis.

“The university overall is wor-
ried about debt accruing against 
their accounts, especially when 
they’re looking at extensive budget 
cuts going into the future,” Gupta 
said. “They’re trying to save any 
amount of money they can, any-
where; $3,000 may not seem like 
a lot to us, but to them it could be 
enough to save a particular pro-
gram.”

Gupta said he expects the uni-
versity to pursue other similar 
debt-reduction efforts in the near 
future.

“There are actual academic 
departments that are in debt to the 
university,” Gupta said. “It will be 
interesting to see how the univer-
sity starts moving forward on all 
of these debts. When the budget 
gets cut, you start looking at where 
your negatives are. They’re going to 
be going after places where there is 
debt, wherever it may lie. It’s more 
a fiscal calculation than anything 
else.”

“Unhealthy lifestyle may have 
been an indicator of the heart disease 
since people who could afford to be 
mummified typically had high socio-
economic status,” Miyamoto said. 
“They were people who worked in the 
courts, priests [and] other high places 
and they likely had a much more 
calorie-rich diet which included salt 
and meat.” 

Despite the relatively small 
sample size, heart disease was 
not uncommon. The presence of 
atherosclerosis was detected in 
both sexes within the designated 
age range. Miyamoto said it was 
difficult to estimate the level of 
atherosclerosis in relation to mod-
ern humans since the levels varied 
widely, but that the basic vascular 
appearance was very similar. 

Miyamoto stressed that although 
genetic predisposition may be a fac-
tor contributing to heart disease, 
the discovery does not give people 
license to ignore the positive effects 
created by a healthy lifestyle. 

“It’s very important for doctors 
to take this information and say 
that yes, we may be predestined, but 
environment is equally powerful and 
we need to make positive changes to 
ensure our health,” Miyamoto said. 

He emphasized the importance of 
lifestyle changes — such as quitting 
smoking and eating a low-fat diet — 
in fighting heart disease. 

“We don’t want people to look 
at this discoery and have a fatalistic 
attitude,” he said. “In fact, we want it 
to be the opposite: tell patients that 
have these dispositions [that] we 
have to concentrate on what we can 

do to optimize lifestyle choices to 
extend life. We can still change our 
risk of heart disease.”

The team members plan to 
return to Cairo later this year in 
order to study mummies from lower 
socioeconomic classes to determine 

if hardening of the arteries is present 
in that demographic as well, as well 
as to discover if it is present in coro-
nary arteries. 

Readers can contact Angela Chen at 
shchen@ucsd.edu.

▶ MUMMIES, from page 2

COURTESEY OF MICHAEL MIYAMOTO 

Computed axial tomography was used to scan the 22 Egyptain mummies to detect signs of atherosclerosis, 
or hardening of the arteries, in heart tissue. Sixteen of the 22 mummies showed signs of heart disease.

Green and the Compost Team peti-
tioned the A.S. Council, arguing that 
the Wedge should fulfill its original 
purpose of becoming a sustainable 
space. Their actions drew the attention 
of Chancellor Marye Anne Fox, who 
supported the project as well.

UCSD Physical Planning specialists 
first envisioned the Wedge in 1994 as 
consisting of four “phases” of construc-
tion in ERC between Ridge Walk and 
North Torrey Pines Rd. Phases I and 
II — which covered ERC’s main stairs 
and the winding path north of Cafe 
Ventanas — were realized in 2003, 
while Phase III was completed in 2007.

However, the university lacked 
financial support for the space between 
the Village and ERC, and construction 
remained idle until student protests 
drew attention to the area.

“Student groups paid attention 
and got people to notice,” Todd 
Pitman, senior planner for UCSD 
Physical Planning and chair of 
the Open Space Committee, said. 
“Chancellor Fox then decided that 
construction should begin as well.” 

According to Pitman, the long-term 
goals for the area include creating a 
functional space with solar capabilities, 
natural seating and pedestrian walk-
ways. Additionally, runoff water from 
other parts of campus will be reclaimed 
to irrigate the area’s landscaping.

“This project is good for the pub-
lic’s perception of UCSD,” Pitman 
said. “We would be showing that we 
practice what we preach by having a 
sustainable area.”

The university still lacks the fund-
ing for all these goals to be met, but 
Assistant Vice Chancellor of Physical 
and Community Planning Brian D. 
Gregory said there is enough to con-
vert the existing parking lot into a 
sustainable area. 

“We don’t have the money to do 
the complete project, which would 
cost over $2 million, and it is going 
to take time to get additional money,” 
Gregory said.

The first part of “Wedge Phase IV” 
consists of ripping out the asphalt, 
planting native coastal foliage and lay-
ing down pathways and infrastruc-
ture for future projects. According 
to Gregory, around $500,000 of the 
$900,000 bill will come from Housing 
and Dining Services, while the rest will 
be drawn from campuswide funds dis-
tributed at the chancellor’s discretion. 

Turner Construction Company 
began the project in October, and 
landscape architects Spurlock Poirier 
worked with the Physical Planning 
Office to plan Phase IV.  Construction 
is set for completion by January 2010.

Eleanor Roosevelt College sopho-
more Danielle Jenné said. “It’s inef-
fective to try to stop something that’s 
going to happen anyway. The govern-
ment needs to mind its own business.”

Twenty-seven drink manufac-
turers — including United Brands 
Company, Inc. and the P.I.N.K. Spirits 
Company/Prohibition Beverage Inc. 
— have been given 30 days to comply 
with the FDA’s request. They must 
supply evidence that their products 
are previously sanctioned or GRAS — 
or they will be outlawed.

Suh said she is unsure a ban on 
alcoholic energy drinks would dis-
courage college students from con-

suming a mix of alcohol and caffeine 
— even if they are not packaged and 
sold together.

“People mix alcohol and Red Bull 
at parties all the time,” Suh said. “A 
ban on alcoholic energy drinks won’t 
change that. It’s just a waste of time.”

Revelle College sophomore 
Nancy Carmona agreed that ban-
ning alcoholic energy drinks should 
not ease the fears of the FDA or the 
task force.

“Instead of completely banning 
the drinks, the government needs 
to spread awareness of the effects 
of mixing those two substances,” 
Carmona said. “That way, people can 
be responsible for their actions, since 

they’re going to be mixing the two 
anyway.”

The FDA expressed that if caf-
feinated alcohol drinks are still 
deemed unsafe within a month, 
manufacturers will most likely be 
forced to halt production.

Anheuser-Busch Co. and 
MillerCoors, the nation’s two largest 
brewers, halted the sale of alcoholic 
energy drinks last year due to the New 
York Attorney General’s concerns that 
the drink’s health effects were being 
misrepresented, and that it was being 
marketed to underage drinkers.

* n the early 1990s, a small population of seals wrig-gled up to a short stretch of prime La Jolla Cove real estate and declared it home. Only problem was, the protected shore was originally created in 1931 as a safe swimming spot for young children. Once the 
seals moved in, local residents began what would be a decade-
plus fight over the beach’s rightful inhabitants.

As much of the threat of a Chargers relocation, the La 
Jolla children-versus-seals showdown is a long-drawn-out 
news item in San Diego. But — as of a Nov. 13 ruling by 
Superior Court Judge Timothy B. Taylor — it seems the 
debate over the Children’s Pool can finally be put to rest. 
Taylor’s ruling: The seals are here to stay. 

The army of local residents fighting to drive the seals 
from the Children’s Pool have long argued that the cove has 
become a tanning bed to the growing colony of sea mammals 
who contaminate the water and prevent humans from utiliz-
ing the site. When Valerie O’Sullivan received a ticket for dis-
turbing the seals while swimming in the cove in 2004, it was 
just what nay sayers needed to ignite the fight. O’Sullivan’s 
citation was evidence of the seals’ increasing rights to the 
beach — rights to which the community had never agreed. 

Soon after receiving the ticket, O’Sullivan brought the 
city to court, citing its failure to maintain the beach in 

accordance with the trust that founded it in 1931. This trust, 
established by late philanthropist and La Jolla resident Ellen 
Browning Scripps (who also founded the Scripps Institute of 
Oceanography upon which UCSD was built), originally stated 
that the cove should be “devoted exclusively to public park, 
bathing pool for children.” 

Scripps commissioned the construction of a 300-foot 
sea wall that now curves around the small beach, protecting 
it from large waves and undercurrents that could endanger 
young swimmers. The site was dubbed the La Jolla Children’s 
Pool, and became a hub for families looking for a stress-free 
day at the beach. 

But, by allowing the seals to take over the beach and 
prevent its use as a “bathing pool,” the city of San Diego had 
failed to uphold Scripps’ land deed.

In 2005, one year after O’Sullivan filed suit, Judge William 
Pate ruled that the seals’ presence and resulting water con-
tamination was indeed counter to Scripps’ trust. Pate ordered 
that the city disperse the seals and clean the beach for human 
use by dredging it, an intensive excavation that would restore 
both the shore and immediate underwater area.

What followed was a series of contradictory back-
and-forth court decisions spanning the five years since 
O’Sullivan’s suit, building off the anger of two passionate 
teams —animal-rights activists on the pro-seals front and La 
Jolla residents on the other — who had been volleying argu-

ments since tensions rose in 
the mid ’90s. 

The anti-seals cam-
paigners, who spawned the 
“Friends of the Children’s 
Pool” Web site www.friend-
softhechildrenspool.com have 
a growing list of complaints 
against the seals. As the seal 
population has increased, 
access to the beach’s ideal 
swimming area has steadily 
declined. And even if one 
can find a swimming spot, 
it’s usually contaminated with 
seal feces.

“It sucks having to swim 
though [the Children’s Pool] 

to go catch a wave or go fishing,” Sixth College senior Michael 
Barrus said.

 Joining the La Jolla residents in the seal resistance were 
local fisherman, who said fish populations were decreasing 
due to the booming seal population. 

But the pro-seal side — who have their own “La Jolla 
Friends of the Seals” Web site www.lajollafriendsoftheseals.
org — argue that the seal population isn’t growing at all. The 
“Friends” site presents studies that estimate the seal popula-
tion at a stable 200, with no notable increase over the past five 
years. 

Seal supporters also turn to the heart-wrenching argu-
ment that — despite its original intent — the Children’s 
Pool has become a necessary sanctuary for animals living 
in a harsh new ocean.

“This is one of the last places for seals to give birth on 
the California coastline,” Friends of the Seals volunteer 
Emily Field said. “If people are walking on the beach dur-
ing pupping season, it scares the seals back into the water, 
making birthing almost impossible.”

Fortunately for Field and her fellow seal advocates, 
Taylor’s Nov. 13 decision has lifted a final protective bub-
ble over the sea-mammal sanctuary in UCSD’s backyard.

Though the decision overturned Pate’s 2005 ruling 
that the seals be forcefully dispersed, the city of San Diego 
expressed that it could not have afforded the hefty price 
tag to dredge the beach anyway. 

This prompted San Diego-district Sen. Christine Keho 
(D-Calif) to introduce legislation in 2007 that would grant 
the city of San Diego discretion over the cove regardless of 
Scripps’ trust. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger signed the bill, 
and the Nov. 13 hearing to determine the fate of the seals 
was scheduled. It was at this hearing that Taylor ruled in 
favor of amending the Scripps trust, allowing the seals to 
remain.

According to Taylor, his decision to let the seals stay 
was out of simple “respect for the legislative and executive 
branches of government.”

But for Field and her fellow pro-sealers, the verdict is, 
above all, a victory for animal rights.

“If we have the ability to restore a small piece of habitat, 
we owe it to the animals to do it,” said Field.

INFOCUS ON-CAMPUS BICYCLE PARKING

Maybe it’s the inflated La Jolla gas prices. Or perhaps it’s the fact that it takes a hopeless half-
hour to score a spot at Hopkins parking 
structure. Either way, one thing’s clear: 
Bicycles are booming. 

But with popularity comes problems. 
The number of bike thefts on campus 
has risen in over the past year, and bike-
related accidents are more frequent due 
to sheer number. But besides theft and 
bloody Library Walk collisions, bikers have 
also (ironically) had issues with parking. 
According to UCSD bicycle enforcement 
officer Ian Happle, parking is one of the 
more common, everyday obstacles that 
the eco-friendly alternative presents.

UCSD bicycle enforcement officers 
will impound any bicycles obstructing 
handicap ramps, fire exits or campus 
artwork. Bikes with flat tires, excessive 
dust or missing parts are usually tacked 
with a warning notice because their 
details indicate abandonment — and if 
these bikes aren’t fixed or relocated soon 
enough, they’ll soon be whisked away as 
well. 

But at least your old friend will be 
going to a good cause. Impounded bikes 
are currently donated to the Donovan 
State Correctional facility in southeast 
San Diego, where inmates refurbish the 
bikes to send to children and nonprofit 
organizations. Bikes that can’t be fixed 
— no matter how many inmates grease 
their parts — are stored for the UCSD 
engineering department’s annual Junkyard 
Derby in May.

J MUSIC STUDIO

SITESEEN To most San Diegans, the neon Korean 
characters hang-
ing above J Music 
Studio are a testa-
ment to the mod-
est charm inside. 
If it weren’t for 
the supplemental 
“Music Studios” 
afterthought, it’s 
doubtful anyone 
would even stop 
to peak inside.

But allow me 
to show you the 
light: J Music 
Studio is a dia-
mond among all 
those mysterious 
Convoy St. gems, 
existing for what 
seems to be a sole 
purpose of letting 
patrons get sloppy drunk 
and sing like they were in 
the privacy of their own 
shower.

Upon entering the 
long-time San Diego 
establishment, karaoke 
hopefuls are offered a 
modest greeting: a small, 
cramped foyer, undecorat-
ed walls and a simple front 
counter manned by a tiny 
old Asian lady who speaks 
very little English. After a 
few moments of awkward 
communication, she will 
lead you down a hallway 
to a small, glass-encased 
room; all the while ignoring the indiscrete brown bags you and 
your friends are juggling. Once she’s closed the door, the boozing 
and belting can begin.

Unlike American romantic-comedy karaoke bars, where sing-
ing is often reserved for one brave volunteer on a center stage, J 
Music Studio styles its establishment on authentic Asian karaoke 
lounges. For an hourly rate, customers can rent out a private room 
stocked with a microphone, television, song menu, wrap-around 
couch and glamorous disco ball — fitting anywhere from four 
to 15, depending on if you’re going for intimate get-together or 
sweaty nightclub.

J Music Studio is intent on maintaining your privacy throughout 
the night — even when you’ve spilled so much beer your socks get 
soggy (to the tune of your favorite Journey ballad, of course).

This karaoke paradise is conveniently located amid several 
other indie Asian delights (read: Yogurt World, Tapioca Express, 
Tofu House), so you can enjoy dinner and drinks before you 
embark on your personalized musical journey — complete with a 
visual montage of ’90s-era Koreans interacting with nature behind 
lyrical prompts.

UNCOMMON

By Angela Chen
Senior Staff Writer

Y ou may have seen him during UCSD’s first-day walkout or even leading discussions at various teach-ins since — probably in his 
signature short-sleeved button-up (variation of 
plaid, untucked) and jeans (always a faded blue). 
Despite his soft-spoken and level-tempered 
demeanor, professor Jorge Mariscal is a tenacious 
voice for social justice at the university.

The various causes to which Mariscal dedi-
cates himself — battling the UC budget cuts, 
promoting campus diversity and countering 
militarism in high school, to name a few — have 
roots in a personal experience.

Although the university’s financial quagmire 
is a recent flare-up, Mariscal has always been 
concerned with the future of public higher 
education in the Golden State. Raised in Long 
Beach, the literature professor and first-genera-
tion college graduate is himself a product of the 
state’s three-tiered system: He transferred from 
a California community college to Cal State 
Long Beach, and eventually received a Ph.D in 
Spanish literature and culture from UC Irvine. 

After a couple out-of-state teaching stints, 
Mariscal joined UCSD’s literature department 
in 1986, where he currently teaches courses in 
Spanish and Chicano literature, as well as install-
ments of Marshall College’s core Dimensions of 
Culture writing program. 

With 23 years of UC teaching under his belt, 

Mariscal has emerged as a key fixture in cam-
puswide events and discussions about the effects 
of the UC budget cuts.

“The budget crisis is a tragedy,” said Mariscal. 
“It’s the result of 30 years of poor government, 
and it’s hard to reverse. The university is making 
excuses and trying to get out by putting the cost 
on students — but the leadership should be find-
ing other solutions.”

He said that the Nov. 17 protests at UCLA 
against the regents’ student-fee hikes were a 
symbol of the UC students’ passion for their 
education — a cause to which he promised to 
contribute.

“I’ll continue working against budget cuts, 
and I’ll be watchful of changes in admissions,” 
said Mariscal. “My ultimate goal is for the 
campus to change to represent the diversity of 
California as California changes.”

This kind of diversity has long been a focus 
for Mariscal. 

“For 20 years, I’ve tried to make the campus 
more democratic,” he said. 

In 1995, Mariscal was chair of the board that 
created the Cross-Cultural Center, a space built 
to foster diversity and tolerance on campus. 
And, as a current faculty equity advisor for the 
Division of Arts and Humanities, he still provides 
consultation within the teaching staff on new 
possibilities to diversify UCSD’s student body.

Mariscal cited low admission rates (relative 
to other ethnic groups) as the reason the Latino 
community is not well represented by UCSD. 

Because of this, he has 
focused his efforts on 
educational issues (such as 
high tuition fees and high 
school military recruiting) 
that keep students from 
pursuing higher education.

Currently, Mariscal 
is active in Movimiento 
Estudiantil Chicana y 
Chicano de Aztlan — a 
student organization which 
fights for equal access in 
higher education.

Mariscal’s most recent M.E.Ch.A. project 
was a new hanging mural at Peterson Hall: The 
professor approached prominent Chicano art-
ist Mario Torero to paint the piece. Originally 
slated for removal at the end of Fall Quarter, the 
mural has received enough petition signatures to 
ensure it a home in Marshall College — at least 
until June 2012. While M.E.Ch.A students col-
lected signatures, Mariscal sought the approval 
of administrators.

On the academic side of things, Mariscal said 
his courses often focus on the history of social 
movements in the United States, which he hopes 
students will connect to their own experiences 
— something he certainly does in his own life.

Like many members of his generation, 
Mariscal began his political streak in the Vietnam

era, when he was drafted into the war.
“After I came back from the 

Vietnam War, I began protesting against 
it,” said Mariscal. “It got me interested 
in the history of militarism and all the 
things that aren’t said about it.”

Today, Mariscal works closely with 
Project on Youth and Non-Military 
Opportunities: a counter-recruitment 
group that speaks to high-school stu-
dents about alternatives to enlisting in 
the military in lieu of (or in order to 
pay for) a college education.

“I feel like students are under 
assault by recruiters, and a lot of 
things are misrepresented,” said 
Mariscal. “Students aren’t getting 
enough information. I want [them] to 
know the entire story before they’re 
recruited. They don’t receive enough 
information, and they’re not told the 
entire story.”

Mariscal said his decision to be an 
activist was a natural one. 

“It was the logical conclusion of 
my own life, and I’ve been surrounded 
by people on campus who keep me 
engaged,” he said. “As a professor, it’s 
easy to slip into research, and former 
students and friends have kept me 
active on the social-justice front.”

SPORTS� MONDAY, NOVEMBER 30, 2009� THE UCSD GUARDIAN 15 

Antelopes, UCSD started tightening 
the reins early on in the second half. 
Sophomore center Lauren Freidenberg 
notched a layup at the 15:22 mark, 
igniting the Tritons to an 11-2 run over 
the next five minutes. 

A foul by Grand Canyon center 
Katie Johnson enabled junior center 
Charity Smith to sink a pair of free 
throws for UCSD and tie the game 
at 50. 

“We didn’t make any specific 
changes [on offense or defense] except 
tell them that we were getting out-
hustled and outworked in the first 
half,” Elliott said. “I thought we dialed 
up our intensity, particularly on the 
defensive end.”

Over the next two minutes, the 
score ping-ponged back and forth 
between the teams until five straight 
points from Carlisle boosted UCSD’s 
lead to 61-55 at the 6:08 mark. Senior 
guard Leilani Martin then scored a 
layup with 4:34 remaining — offering 
the Tritons their largest advantage of 
the game at 66-59. 

Grand Canyon pulled within two  

points with 2:31 left, but Friedenberg 
came up with a crucial offensive 
rebound, scoring a layup to extend the 
Triton lead to four. Again, a pair of free 
throws from Antelope Ashley Hardin 
made it a two-point game. With 1:57 
left on the clock, Ilg drew a foul, hit-
ting one of two free throws to give the 
Tritons a three-point advantage. 

With the game on the line, the 
Antelopes sunk two free throws, tak-
ing the game 71-70 and keeping it a 
nail-biter until the final seconds. 

After a jumper from Carlisle 
missed its mark, Grand Canyon had 
one final chance to claim the win — 
but Antelope forward Stacy Haddow 
missed her three-point attempt, allow-
ing UCSD to seize a rousing victory in 
its season opener. 

Four players reached double fig-
ures on the Triton side. Carlisle led 
all scorers with 20 points, adding five 
assists, five steals and three rebounds. 
Hunter was superb in her first game 
for UCSD shooting five of eight from 
the field for 12 points. Ilg tallied 12 
and finished with four steals, while 
Freidenberg contributed 10 points and 

hauled in seven boards. 
“We have depth and players 

from all realms,” senior forward Erin 
Noonan said. “We have girls that are 
amazing shooters, girls who hustle 
after every ball, girls who are great 
rebounders and girls that have amaz-
ing defense.”

The Tritons now look to their first 
CCAA matchup against Cal State San 
Bernardino on Dec. 4 at Coussoulis 
Arena. The Coyotes were the only 
team to defeat UCSD in conference 
play last season, taking a 62-57 victory 
on March 3.

“This is a huge weekend com-
ing up,” Elliott said. “Not only is San 
Bernardino our second game, but it’s 
also our conference opener — so cer-
tainly, it takes on a whole other level of 
importance. I know we’ve used these 
last 10 days to sharpen up on some 
things that we didn’t do real well. 
We’re looking to come out from the 
beginning with a tremendous sense of 
urgency.”

Tritons Drop Pair of Games at Shrine Classic

By Joe Tevelowitz &           
Cameron Tillisch
Senior Staff Writers

MEN’S BASKETBALL — Following a 
tough loss to Division-I neighbor San 
Diego State, the UCSD men’s basket-
ball team traveled to the Al Kaly Shrine 
Classic in Pueblo, Colo., on Nov. 20, 
hoping to open their regular-season 
schedule with a win. Despite a strong 
effort, the Tritons dropped both  tour-
nament games, falling 71-63 in over-
time against Western State College on 
Nov. 20 before dropping a 61-43 deci-
sion to host Colorado State University-
Pueblo the following day. 

UCSD (0-2) will now prepare for 
the start of their California Collegiate 
Athletic Association tour: an away 
game at Cal State San Bernardino on 
Dec. 4.

A slow start by the Tritons was 
the difference in the game against 
CSU-Pueblo. The ThunderWolves 
outscored UCSD 11-0 during a key 
eight-minute stretch in the first half 
of the game. However, the Tritons 
shot only 21 percent from the field 
in the first half — hitting just 4-19 
shot attempts — their defense was able 
to hold the ThunderWolves to 36.4 
percent shooting and 0 for 11 from 
the three-point range before halftime. 
But CSU-Pueblo managed to build a 
14-point lead at the break — thanks in 
large part to 12 first-half steals. 

Junior guard Casey Ryan scored 12 
points and hauled in a game-high 11 
rebounds, but his effort wasn’t enough 
— UCSD could not climb within nine 
points of the ThunderWolves in the 
second half.

“We just kind of ran out of gas,” 
Carlson said. “Their pressure really 
bothered us. We expended a lot of 
energy trying to get back into the 
game.” 

CSU-Pueblo’s Daniel Pierce scored 
a game-high 19 points to lead the 
host team to victory. Freshman guard 
Dylan Bohanan provided a bright 
streak for the Tritons, scoring seven 
points with four rebounds within 15 
minutes off the bench. 

CSU-Pueblo shot at a 45-percent 
clip in the second half. The Tritons, 
on the other hand, finished shoot-
ing under 32 percent for the game 
and recorded only three assists. The 
ThunderWolves finished the game 
with 17 steals and outscored the 
Tritons 25-9 on points off turnovers.

The loss to CSU-Pueblo came on 
the heels of the Tritons’ tournament-
opening defeat to Western State the 
previous night. They allowed a late 
lead to slip away to the Mountaineers  
— despite a solid showing from senior 

guard Jordan Lawley, who turned in a 
team-high 21 points and four assists, 
along with nine rebounds.

UCSD’s first victory of the year 
seemed to appear on the horizon after 
Lawley’s three-pointer gave the Tritons 
a 53-41 lead with 7:04 left in regulation. 
However, the Mountaineers scored the 
next 15 points of the game, shocking 
the Tritons by taking a 56-53 lead after 
a three-pointer by Western State with 
32 seconds remaining. Senior guard 
Tyler Acevedo answered dramatically 
with a three-pointer off a pass from 
freshman forward Justin Brue, tying 
the game with 12 seconds left.

Despite the momentum from 
Acevedo’s final shot and two quick 
points in overtime from sophomore 
center Christian Hatch, UCSD once 
again fell behind. 

Forward Dan Biber’s jumper 
keyed a 12-2 overtime run for the 
Mountaineers, giving the team a 69-60 
advantage. Acevedo hit another three 
with 11 seconds left, but Western 
State College responded with two free 
throws to seal the win.

“We did a really good job getting 
to a point and just didn’t handle the 
pressure really well,” Carlson said. “We 

did a lot of good things in that game. 
Unfortunately, we didn’t take care of 
the ball.”

Acevedo finished with 13 points, 
landing three of six three-pointers. 
Ryan played a solid game, adding five 
points and 10 rebounds. Brue scored 
six points and collected rebounds, two 
blocks, a steal and an assist in 24 min-
utes of playing time. Freshman Jake 
Tarabilda also scored six points with 
three rebounds and two assists. As a 
team, the Tritons converted half of 
their three-point attempts, converted 
on 72.4 percent of their free-throw 
opportunities and out-rebounded the 
Mountaineers 52-37, but were undone 
by 17 turnovers — compared to only 
eight from Western State.

The Tritons look to get back on 
track on Dec. 4 as they head into 
CCAA play against a familiar foe: 
defending conference champion Cal 
State San Bernardino. UCSD lost 
by four points to the Coyotes in the 
second round of last season’s CCAA 
Tournament.

Tillisch at ctillisch@ucsd.edu.

Losses to Western State

CLUB UPDATE
The UCSD equestrian team hosted and

Bonita, Calif. Aside from victory, four 
members of the UCSD squad earned 
automatic bids for the 2009-10 regional 
championships. 

By Brianna Lee
Senior Staff Writer

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL — After a chal-
lenging preseason that included games against 
Division-I opponents Stanford University 
and the University of San Diego, the Tritons 
opened their 2009-10 regular season with a 
hard-fought road victory in Phoenix, Ariz. 

The UCSD women’s basketball team 
defeated Grand Canyon University 71-70 at 
Antelope Gym on Nov. 21. Down by 15 in 
the first half, the Tritons rallied in the second 
period to tie the game and trump the defend-
ing Pacific West Conference champs by one 
point to earn UCSD its first win of the season. 

“I think our effort and heart contributed 
most to our success,” junior forward Tiffany 
Hunter said. “We were down by seven at half-
time, and came out in the second half with 
relentless effort. We had the mindset to get a 
defensive stop on every play, crash the boards 
and quickly transition into offense. When we 
did those three things, we saw results that 
contributed to our success.”

Senior guard Annette Ilg got things started 
for the Tritons, nailing a three-pointer right 
out of the gate. Grand Canyon responded 
with a 16-6 run 12 minutes into the game and 
continued to dominate the first half, picking 
up the largest lead of the game when junior 
guard Samantha Murphy converted on free 
throws to stretch Grand Canyon’s advantage 
39-24.

UCSD struck back with a three-point play 
by junior forward Tiffany Hunter and two free 
throws from Ilg, cutting the Antelope lead to 
10 with 2:14 left in the half. Sophomore guard 
Chelsea Carlisle battled to keep the Tritons 
within arm’s reach before heading into the 
locker room, hitting a three-pointer to close 
out the scoring for the first half. 

“I was really pleased with our fight and 
determination to get the win, especially when 
we were down by 15,” head coach Charity 
Elliott said. “We could’ve folded, but instead 
we decided to dig down and get one stop at 
a time on the defensive end. Tiffany [Hunter] 
and Lauren [Freidenberg] did a fantastic job 
getting rebounds and putbacks, and Chelsea 
Carlisle did a great job hitting some big shots 
and directing us on both ends.”
