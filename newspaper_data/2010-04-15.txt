Miscommunication among 
A.S. councilmembers regarding 
the Grove Cafe’s health rating  
temporarily obstructed plans to 
allow dining dollars to be used as 
a form of payment at the strug-
gling eatery earlier this month.

Bringing dining dollars to 
the Grove is part of the coun-
cil’s ongoing attempt to revital-
ize its lagging enterprise, which 
reopened in January after a brief 
remodeling period. 

At the final student coun-
cil meeting of Winter Quarter, 
Vice President of Finance 
and Resources Peter Benesch 
announced that dining dollars 
would be accepted at the cafe 
beginning Spring Quarter. 

However, rumors that the 
Grove had received a ‘B’ health 
rating postponed the council’s 
efforts.

In spring of 2009, the Grove — 
which is currently about $130,000 
dollars in debt — received a ‘B’ rat-
ing from the UCSD Environment, 

Health & Safety Department 
due to sanitation issues, accord-
ing to UCSD health inspector 
Jeff Eisnert. EH&S is responsible 
for UCSD’s food-facility inspec-
tion program, which is designed 
to protect the public from food-
borne illnesses. 

Permanent food facilities on 
campus are inspected and rated by 
EH&S four times a year. 

During a health inspection last 
Winter Quarter — one year after 
the ‘B’ rating — councilmembers 
were worried the cafe would again 
receive a ‘B’.

This sparked a rumor that 
such a rating had already been 
assigned. According to Eisnert, 
the Grove earned a ‘B’ during 
its Feb. 10 inspection, but has 
restored the grade to an ‘A’ by a 
March 1 inspection.

However, councilmembers 
were unaware of the results, allow-
ing rumors to eventually reach 
Housing, Dining & Hospitality 
Director Mark Cunningham. 
Because HDH has a strict policy

After the attorney general’s office re-worded 
the description of the California Democracy Act 
in November, the proposed amendment — a 
ballot measure would simplify legislative vot-
ing guidelines — has been withdrawn. Professor 
George Lakoff of UC Berkeley, author of the mea-
sure, announced April 7 that he will rewrite the 
legislation and resubmit it by the June 24 deadline 

for consideration on the 
November ballot.

If passed, the act 
would repeal the requie-
ment that any bill in the 
state legislature related to 
budget issues be passed 
with a two-thirds major-
ity. Instead, budgetary 
decisions would only 
require the ‘yes’ vote of 
over 50 percent of leg-
islators in order to pass. 

Chris Ah San, stu-
dent director of the 
California Democracy 
Act Coalition, said alter-
ing the rule will allow 
majority legislators to 

make decisions on topics like increasing state 
funding for public higher education. 

“The source of the problem is minority rule,” 
Lakoff said. 

The initiative required 694,354 signatures to 
be placed on the November ballot. Ah San said 
the coalition received approximately 60,000 of the 
necessary signatures. 

Lakoff withdrew the measure after California 
Attorney General Jerry Brown reworded the 
proposal’s official summary in a way that Lakoff 
claims is misleading and negative. In California, 
the attorney general can reword both a proposi-
tion’s  title and purpose however he chooses.

The original summary stated: “All legisla-
tive actions on revenue and budget must be 
determined by a majority vote.” Brown changed 
the summary to read: “Changes legislative vote 
requirement to pass a budget or raise taxes from 
two-thirds to a simple majority.” 

California Attorney General press secretary 
Christine Gasparac said the office rarely uses the 
wording provided by the author of the bill. 

“We try to provide a fair wording that isn’t 
biased in favor of whoever proposed the mea-
sure,” she said. 

Gasparac added that Lakoff ’s reference to the 
word “taxes” was based on the findings of a chief 
analyst, who examined the bill and determined that 
the measure would most likely result in an increase 
in taxes, not revenue — which is defined as the

After a year of paying rent with-out a lease agreement, the student-run co-operatives at 
UCSD — the Che Cafe Collective, 
the UCSD Food Co-operative, 
Groundwork Books and the UCSD 
General Store Co-operative — will 
meet with officials from University 
Centers on April 16 to request a com-
plete alleviation of rent responsibilities.

According to Andrew Rubens, a 
member of the G-Store, the co-ops 
plan to request rent-free spaces because 
they consider themselves to be com-
munities — not businesses with the 
goal of generating profits.

“A business should pay rent because 
they’re making money, but our pur-
pose is to educate and promote a cli-
mate of awareness and higher learning 

for students,” Rubens said. “Within that 
context, is it is absurd to ask a nonprofit 
— whose entire goal and existence is to 
benefit students, and which is made up 
of students — to pay the same rent as 
another business would.”

The former lease agreement, from 
2006, applies to all the co-ops, but each

Researchers at the Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography have cre-
ated an underwater vehicle powered 
by thermal energy, which they say 
could run indefinitely. 

“We can take energy out of the 
environment without harming it in an 
underwater vehicle,” Scripps oceanog-
rapher Russ Davis said. 

The Scripps team worked with the 
Jet Propulsion Lab — an organiza-
tion based in Pasadena, Calif. — to 
engineer an eight-foot-tall, 180-pound 
cylinder that runs on natural and 
renewable energy from the ocean. 

The new design can dive at a more 
frequent basis than the old one — dur-
ing its three-month trial, the new ves-
sel made over 300 dives, whereas the 
old model was capable of making only 
12 dives in that amount of time. The 
ability to collect data faster, Davis said, 
could aid in monitoring worldwide cli-
mate change. He said his team hopes 

to eventually deploy the vessel to 
replace many of the some 3,000 similar 
buoys currently scattered across the 
ocean. The buoys are part of the Argo 
project, which aims to track seasonal 
changes in ocean temperature, salinity 
and velocity. 

The new vehicle draws on the 
energy generated from the natural 
temperature differences found at dif-
ferent oceanic depths — from the 
warm waters of the surface to the 
cold waters closer to the bottom — to 
recharge its built-in battery.

The charge cycle begins when the 
battery turns on a motor that pulses oil 
into a bag at the bottom of the cylinder 
— which then changes the buoyancy 
of the vehicle and allows it to rise or 
fall. As the vessel rises from the middle 
depths of the ocean, it reaches warmer 
waters at the top. 

A temperature-sensitive wax stored 
in cylinders throughout the vessel 
melts and expands when it comes into 
contact with this thermal energy, and 
pushes the oil back through the tur-

bine so it can recharge the battery. 
When the vessel’s buoyancy 

changes due to the new balance of oil, 
it drops back into the ocean and the 
wax contracts and solidifies — starting 
the process over again.

“Similar things have been done by 
using oil for buoyancy, but this is the 
first time we’ve made a thermal motor 
for it,” engineer Kyle Grindley said.

According to Davis, this new 
method of powering the machines will 
allow vehicles to explore and study the 
ocean for extended periods of time.

“This technology to harvest energy 
from the ocean will have huge impli-
cations for how we can measure and 
monitor the ocean and its influence on 
climate,” Davis said. 

The new design was born from 
one of  two originally proposed blue-
prints. The other design  would have 
been capable of horizontal movement 
through the water, acting as a glider 
through the ocean. 

According to Davis, the Scripps 
team may eventually be able to imple-

ment this design as well,  opening a 
new range of movement in perpetual 
ocean travel.

“This is the great thrill of my life,” 
Davis said. “We’ve been involved in the 
‘Rush Limbaugh’ fight in whether the 
world has been warming or not.”

Next, the Scripps team will re-
examine the vessel in an attempt 
to streamline its complex interior, 
decrease costs and lower the weight of 
the vessel to 50 pounds — the current 
weight of the buoys being utilized in 
the Argo project.

NEWS� THURSDAY, APRIL 15, 2010� THE UCSD GUARDIAN 3 

one calculates its rent based on square 
footage. Based on that evaluation, the 
monthly rent has been $1,450.97 for 
the G-Store, $521.70 for the Food 
Co-op, $84.00 for the Che Cafe and 
$788.55 for Groundwork Books.

Food Co-op core member Sarah 
Latoski said that, because the mort-
gages for the co-op buildings have been 
paid off, co-ops shouldn’t have to pay 
rent apart from utilities and insurance.

“I don’t think it’s unrea-
sonable for us to be paying 
some sort of nominal fee 
for monthly maintenance, 
but I don’t think we should 
be paying rent, because it’s 
just profit for the univer-
sity,” Latoski said.

The space agreement 
between the university 
and the co-ops is normal-
ly renegotiated every two 
years. When the agreement 
was revisited in the 2008-
09 school year, however, 
the co-ops refused to sign 
an amendment to the con-
tract that would have clari-
fied the property lines of 
Groundwork and the G-Store. 

Though Latoski said the amend-
ment was largely inconsequential, 
co-op members refused to sign the 
revised contract in order to make a 
statement about rent prices at the time. 
They were not aware that not signing 
the proposal would void the lease. 

“We collectively decided in the 
[co-op] union to not sign the amend-
ment, to make a gesture to the univer-
sity that we aren’t happy with the lease 
agreement,” Latoski said. 

In response, the University Centers 
Advisory Board reverted the agree-
ment with the co-ops to a month-to-
month rental plan. While long-term 
leases require a landlord to provide 
just cause before an eviction can be 
carried out, paying rent on such a 
short-term basis gives the university 

greater control over the space.
“The month-to-month plan puts us 

in a vulnerable position with the uni-
versity because at any point, they can 
give us an eviction notice,” Latoski said.

The co-ops are now looking to 
negotiate an agreement with University 
Centers that would either significantly 
reduce their rent or eliminate it entirely. 
According to Director of University 
Centers Paul Terzino, this is not the 
first time the co-ops have requested 

such a reduction.
“They’ve made a simi-

lar request to reduce rent 
in the past, and every time 
they submit a request, 
I ask to see their finan-
cial statements to get an 
understanding of how well 
they’re doing, how well the 
stores are doing — and 
I have not received that,” 
Terzino said.

Terzino added that if 
the co-ops do not bring 
financial statements to 
Friday’s meeting, no 
negotiation of rent prices 
will take place.

According to Latoski, 
the absence of financial statements 
is due to the co-ops’ communication 
problems with accountants hired from 
outside the university, as well as a com-
puter failure that erased all accounting 
records at the Food Co-op last quarter.

“I wasn’t planning on [bringing 
financial statements],” Latoski said.

Although Terzino said he is open 
to reducing rent for the co-ops, he said 
that eliminating payments entirely is 
unlikely due to the financial woes cur-
rently weighing on University Centers. 

According to Terzino, around 65 
percent of the department’s funding 
come from student fees, while the 
rest is derived from rent or retail — 
UCAB oversees both the old Student 
Center and Price Center, so part of its 
revenue comes from enterprises like 
the UCSD Bookstore and the UCSD 

Bike Shop. Eliminating one of those 
sources entirely could have a nega-
tive effect on University Center’s func-
tions, which are already strained.

Terzino added that learning to bal-
ance a budget — including rent — is 
part of running a student business. 

According to Latoski, however, the 
co-ops have seen a dramatic decrease 
in revenue since the expansion of Price 
Center and the renovations that took 
place in the Student Center in 2005. 
The Food Co-op and the Che Cafe 
have already eliminated paid positions 
to become entirely volunteer-based, 
and are still unable to sustain them-
selves at current rent prices.

“We have been paying rent,” 
Latoski said. “What we’ve realized, 
though, is that — through paying rent 
— we are not able to financially sup-
port ourselves as we’re able to without 
the rent there. I agree it’s a part of 
the learning process, but what we’ve 
learned is that we can’t do it.” 

Rubens said that some co-ops’ 
daily net values dropped from about 
$1,000 a day to $200 a day during the 
2005 renovations. Remodeling efforts, 
for example, shut down some co-ops 
for days, and electrical and plumbing 
re-wiring temporarily blocked access 
to the Food Co-op’s kitchen. 

“Two years of us being invisible to 
the student eye — that was a whole 
generation of students who didn’t ever 
know about us,” Latoski said. “There 
are students who come in here now 
and they’re in their fourth year, and 
they’re like, ‘This is the first time I’ve 
been here because I’ve never walked 
through the old Student Center.’”

Determining whether the co-ops 
are financially solvent is the respon-
sibility of the A.S. Council and the 
Graduate Student Association, accord-
ing to the 2006 space agreement. 
Before the newly drafted agreement 
can go before UCAB for approval, 
the A.S. council and the GSA have to

was announced.

Audible gasps filled the A.S.

ended at 7:30 p.m.

2007-08 A.S. 
President Marco 
Murillo made an 
appearance, con-
gratulating both 
the council and 
current president 
Utsav Gupta for 
“taking a lot of heat from the Koala,” 
and dealing effectively under pres-
sure in front of the student body. 

In member reports, Associate 
Vice President of Student Services 
Meredith Madnick showed a cute lit-
tle advertisement, shot in the CLICS 
library, for the Amp energy drink, a 
product of  Triton Television.

Vice President of External Affairs 
Gracelynne West announced that 
there would be a state voter regis-
tration drive. She said she hopes to 
gather at least 1,500 signatures.

Marshall Chair Tanvir Dhillon 
shared plans to provide an all-college 
free hot dog on a stick to all near the 
day of Sun God. 

The February demands of the 
Black Student Union asked for a 
formation of committees with both 
administrative and student represen-
tation. Campuswide Senator Bryant 
Pena announced his position on one 
of these committees, which focuses on 
creating a mandatory diversity course 
requirement for all the colleges.

Transfer Senator Adam Powers 
presented a PowerPoint slide regard-
ing the Villagers — his affectionate 

name for the residents of the new 
transfer-student on-campus housing. 

His presentation highlighted the 
various Village events and their suc-
cess rate, gauged by surveys he hand-
ed out at last week’s barbeque event. 

The A.S. meeting was virtu-
ally empty, and a call for quorum 
revealed that, for the second week in 
a row, only 18 voting members were 
present — one more than needed for 

quorum. 
Advocate gen-

eral Parminder 
Sandhu gave a 
warning about 
absences, and 
promised to bring 
them to the table 

at next week’s meeting.
In a report from the finance com-

mittee, Gupta justified the hiring of 
an athletics consultant for $28,000 
to investigate both Division-I sports 
teams and a football team at UCSD. 
The council will fund $7,000 of the 
consultant’s salary from Enterprise 
Income, while the rest will be split 
between the athletics department,  
the chancellor’s fund and the vice 
chancellor’s fund.

“[The consultant] was the most 
experienced and most afford-
able option… and in tune with 
the NCAA, and the knowledge of 
requirements to play,” Gupta said.

VP of Finance and Resources 
Peter Benesch had good news for 
the Sun God Festival: He pointed to 
an unused $1,000 line item on the 
executive budget. It was meant for the 
student-government bridge program, 
which would have been used to trans-
port A.S. council out of San Diego to 
bond with other communities. 

“Well, there’s a need for a Sun 
God water slide, so we’re going to 
put those funds to good use on May 
13,” Benesch said.

STEFANY CHEN/GUARDIAN

We may have entered the 21st century of civil disobedience, 
but  — while hundreds of stu-
dents can still get away with an 
occupation of the chancellor’s 
office — our antiquated admin-
istration doesn’t seem to take 
kindly to a little virtual rebellion 
from one of their own.

The UCSD Audit & 
Management Advisory Services 
is currently investigating UCSD 
visual-arts professor Ricardo 
Dominguez for staging a Virtual 
Sit-In, during which he and 
about 400 others hacked into 
the UCOP Web site, where 
they created error messages 
like “There is no justice at the 
University of California Office 
of the President.” Already in a 
bit of trouble since he developed 
a cell-phone application to help 
illegal immigrants cross the 
U.S. border, Dominguez now 
faces losing his tenure — which 
would make it much easier for 
the university to eliminate him 
altogether.

Ironically, holding Virtual 

Sit-Ins is exactly the kind of 
behavior that helped Dominguez 
land his job here in 2005. The 
professor is renowned for his 
Internet protests — particularly, 
a successful 1998 attempt to shut 
down a Mexican government’s 
Web site. 

The only difference between 
Dominguez’ prior activities and 
the incident now threatening his 
job, of course, is his choice of 
targets. Now that the impeccable 
UCOP reputation is at stake, 
Dominguez’s ACS account was 
shut down and officials have ini-
tiated an investigation. Whatever 
that means.

Of course, the university has 
every legal right to continue an 
investigation of Dominguez — 
and, if that investigation yields 
just cause, is also entitled to 
strip him of his tenure. 

But whether Dominguez 
technically broke the law isn’t 
our primary concern. What’s at 
stake is the preservation of dis-
senting opinions within the uni-
versity setting. Higher education 
is about challenging preexisting 
ideas and using the resources 
around us to form your own 
opinions about the world. Before 
university higher-ups choose 
whether to press charges, they 
should first consider the mes-
sage they’re sending. By termi-
nating a well-loved and highly 

valued visual arts professor or 
taking any measures to silence 
his (particularly well-thought) 
dissent, the university is saying 
its image takes precedence over 
its responsibility to educate. 
We’re not here to get a cookie-
cutter representation of life 
according to the UCOP; we’re 
paying to exist in an institution 
where we have diverse opin-
ions, the freedom to think and 
say what we want and — most 
importantly — someone who 
will teach us to question the way 
things are.

Let’s stop a second and take 
this protest out of its virtual 
context. If Dominguez had, for 
example, disrupted UCOP’s 
day-to-day business by holding 
a nonviolent two-hour sit-in at 
their headquarters in Oakland, 
there would be no question of 
him losing his tenure. At worst, 
security would have called 
the police and he’d have been 
removed from the property and 
fined for trespassing — or, more 
likely, the whole thing would 
have blown over along with the 
rest of the demonstrations that 
took place that day. 

So, it becomes apparent that 
the university is jumping at the 
chance to punish a protester — 
despite the fact that Dominguez 
insists he didn’t technically vio-
late the law.

As Dominguez was hired 
on the basis that Virtual Sit-Ins 
were part of his M.O. — and was 
liked enough to be granted ten-
ure in 2009 — this latest inves-
tigation is made all the more 
catty. The university is trying to 
expel him for what he was hired 
to do. Should Dominguez lose 
his tenure, it will send an intimi-
dating message to all other fac-
ulty members who rightfully use 
their university resources daily 
to lecture on the downfalls of 
this institution. And we all know 
Dominguez isn’t the only one. 

Problem is, virtual protests 
like his exist in a judicial gray 
area. If administrators think the 
best way to punish Dominguez’ 
dissent is to take away his tenure 
(a very rare occurrence, usu-
ally in response to more serious 
wrongdoings such as sexual mis-
conduct), it’s devaluing the kind 
of opposing viewpoints that 
make our education worthwhile. 

Ironically enough, with all 
the national press Dominguez 
has garnered, he’s actually 
helped boost the university’s 
image; he’s publicized the fact 
that we’re a thinking, artful 
bunch — not just the square-
eyed engineers and lab rats of 
tomorrow. Pick your battles, 
UCSD. This one only publicizes 
your staunch desire to sterilize 
our college experience.

Because I am a nerd, watching “Lost” holds a fairly prominent position in my top-five list 
of things to do whenever possible. 
Because I am a nerd who commits, 
the vigor and tenacity with which I 
pursue this activity is rivaled only by 
the vigor and tenacity with which I 
read comic strips, visit Wikipedia and 
think about Princess Leia naked. 

Oddly enough, my fascination 
with the greatest television show 

ever has rarely proven beneficial to 
me outside the realm of my own 
Cheeto-stained self-indulgence. I 
cannot list “Big fan of ‘Lost’” as a 
qualification on my resume. I have 
never successfully introduced the 
Dharma Initiative into a conversation 
about modern scientific exploration. 
And, despite my dashing good looks, 
women tend to step slowly away 
when I begin discussing the mysteries 
of the Island. 

“What do you think the statue is?”
“I really don’t know what you’re 

talking about.”
“The one with four toes.”
“I’m gonna go now.”
This in mind, it has recently 

occurred to me that my relation-
ship with “Lost” may be somewhat 
unhealthy. According to my calcula-
tions, I have spent roughly 120 hours 
of my life watching the show, roughly 
42 hours thinking about it, roughly 
23 hours thinking about how much I 
think about it and roughly 16 hours 
trying to understand the concept of 
irony. 

This is, of course, in addition to 
the eight-month period during which 
I discussed the show at length with 
my former roommate, who — after 
being hit by a truck and prescribed 
massive amounts of Vicodin — could 
formulate theories about the smoke 
monster for days at a time without 
moving from the couch. He was the 
greatest friend I ever had. 

Now, with only six episodes left in 
the series, my obsession has peaked. 
“Fan” is no longer an adequate 
description of my association with 
the show. Rather, I tend to think of 
myself as a disciple — a devoted fol-
lower hand-picked to receive the vast 
wealth of sci-fi awesomeness sure to 
pour from these final episodes. The 
journey has been long and strenuous; 
the Hulu sessions have been rife with 
emotion; the damage to my social life 
has been considerable. 

As with any great obsession, 
however, comes the inevitable pull of 
desperation. Like a junkie torn from 
his fix or an unpopular kid torn from 
his Xbox, I will soon be separated 
from “Lost” forever — left to pore 
aimlessly over reruns and the fast-
approaching barrage of weirdo fan 
fiction sure to spring from the show’s 
ashes. 

This sad realization has left me to 
contemplate the exact mechanisms by 
which I may cope with losing such an 
important part of my life. As I see it, 
my best options are as follows:

1) Maroon myself on a tropical 
island and spend the next six years re-
enacting the entire show.

DRAWING FIRE By Johan DeLaTorre

Dear Editor,

On this 95th anniversary of the 
Armenian genocide, what can we 
say? A charismatic President Barack 
Obama — who provided the most 
promising language to acknowledge 
the Armenian genocide in decades 
— proved to be a major disappoint-
ment. This is not “what change looks 
like.” 

His administration put more effort 
into preventing the March 4 House 
resolution acknowledging the geno-
cide from going to a full vote — and 
into encouraging Turkish-Armenian 
protocols that have done nothing to 
further relations or border improve-
ment between those nations. At best, 
Turkey merely tolerates Armenia in 
these diplomatic dances.

Yet how much more proof does 
the world need to know the Armenian 
genocide was real? Bob Simon of “60 
Minutes” digging up the bones of our 
deported, death-marched ancestors 
in the Der Zor desert of Syria last 
month? Our remaining genocide sur-
vivors in wheelchairs still commemo-
rating the genocide around the world, 
because the photographs of their mur-
dered family members propel them 
to show up for the truth? Insurance 
policies from New York Life, accounts 
from Deutsche Bank and Ottoman 
Empire land deeds — all belonging to 
Armenians who were killed, with no 
way for surviving family members to 
make a claim? 

None of this makes Turkey look 
very good. Neither does Prime 
Minister Recep Erdogan’s March 18 
flippant remarks about deporting 
100,000 Armenians from Turkey. 
Now, for various reasons, Turkey finds 
itself on the bad side of Israel, the U.S. 
and other nations. Extremist Muslims 
who see Turkey as too secular or west-

ern are creating an environment of 
danger there, such that travel alerts are 
currently being issued warning U.S. 
citizens not to travel to Turkey. 

Only when the world cares enough 
about this issue will the Turkish 
government feel, perhaps, enough 
pressure to face the truth — because 
it certainly doesn’t have that moral 
compass within. This editorialist and 
others have spent years citing all the 
common statistics of how many mil-
lion Armenians were lost in 1915, how 
many American and European diplo-
mats and missionaries wrote firsthand 
accounts of the Armenian genocide 
they witnessed in various villages, how 
Turkey has denied the truth in many 
ways and how many other regimes 
have studied the Armenian genocide 
to plan their own destructive agendas. 
There are many Web sites available to 
study those statistics including www.
armenian-genocide.org.

We Armenians are again deeply 
disappointed to have our hopes 
raised, then dashed; to hear promises 
made to us that are not fulfilled and 
see other nations’ economic agendas 
crowding out the needs of our own 
homeland. Others may say our coun-
try is not the only one who experi-
ences such disappointments and that 
we should join the club. 

Join the club? Friends, Armenia 
started the club.

This would be pretty weird, and 
would likely have some negative 
effects on my relationships with my 
parents, my friends and anyone I 
ever meet for the rest of my life. On 
the upside, there’s a good chance 
that — after a few months of social 
isolation and the rigors of surviving 
in the wild — I would absorb my 
delusion entirely and begin to hal-
lucinate, thus enhancing the realism 
of the whole experience. 

As a bonus, this would also set 
me up perfectly to be the subject 
of a successful Oliver Stone movie. 
I would be played by Jonah Hill, 
and my love interest would be por-

trayed by Natalie Portman dressed 
as Queen Amidala. The sex scenes 
alone would merit an oscar nomi-
nation

2) Obsessively stalk the show’s 
principal cast members. 

Also weird, though less likely to 
end with me starving to death than 
Option one. Despite popular mis-
conception, the stalking of celebri-
ties is in fact a noble pursuit that 
can further one’s academic study 
of a particular character or work 
of fiction. It would also potentially 
give me the opportunity to spend 
some time in prison  — a condition 
that would allow me to live out the 
excitement of Ben’s captivity in the 

hatch during Season Two, or Jack’s 
imprisonment on Hydra Island dur-
ing Season Three. 

3) Start a “Lost” blog.
I am not that big of a loser.
4) Find a new show to watch.
A distinct possibility, though 

carrying around the kind of emo-
tional baggage sure to come with 
my traumatic “Lost” breakup will 
render me wholly incapable of 
appreciating action, intrigue or 
witty dialogue in any form for at 
least four years. As it stands, I’d 
rather find a new pile of decompos-
ing animal parts to stare at, which 
would be at least as good as any-
thing else on ABC.

6 THE UCSD GUARDIAN� THURSDAY, APRIL 15, 2010� NEWS

of only allowing dining dollars to be 
accepted by eateries with an ‘A’ health 
rating, the misunderstanding stalled 
the project indefinitely. 

“We are trying to figure out why 
we were told something that doesn’t 
seem to be true anymore,” Benesch 
said of the misunderstanding.

Associate Vice President of 
Enterprise Operations Rishi Ghosh 
attributed the confusion surrounding 
the Grove’s situation to poor com-
munication between the council and 
Thomas Frank, student manager at 
the cafe.

“There has been a lack of com-
munication from Tom Frank, a lack 

of communication with [the A.S. 
Council], and repeated attempts by [the 
council] to make that communication 
with him,” Ghosh said. “In [the coun-
cil], we are all very concerned with his 
performance and his lack of response.”

Benesch said that, by working 
with Cunningham, he has already 
resolved the logistical problems fac-
ing the Grove — such as conver-
sion between cash, dining dollars and 
Triton Cash — and that the health 
rating is the sole remaining factor 
preventing the dining-dollar pro-
gram from being implemented. 

Benesch, who has not yet com-
municated with Ghosh on the situ-
ation, added that once Eisnert offi-

cially clarifies the health rating and 
assesses a report, the Grove will have 
a dining-dollar option implemented 
within a week.

“The only thing that slowed down 
our progress was the health rating,” 
Benesch said. “If it wasn’t for that, 
we literally already had a document 
ready to be signed between HDH and 
the Grove. All it would take is just a 
quick visit from some of HDH’s engi-
neers, and dining dollars would have 
been in there in a day or two.”

Frank could not be reached for 
comment.

state’s total income. 
Lakoff said he intends to make 

the act’s wording more specific before 
resubmission. In the new legislation, 
the ‘purpose’ section will state that 
the intent of the legislation is to bring 
democracy to the California legislature 
through majority rule, not to raise 
taxes. Ah San said the use of “taxes” 
instead of “revenue” could hurt the 
act’s chances of passing in November.

“There’s a big difference between 
raising revenue and raising taxes,” 
Ah San said. “We did a lot of polling 
on the language and discovered that 
when people hear ‘raise taxes’ they 
hear ‘raise my taxes.’”

According to Ah San, the coalition’s 
polls revealed that support for the bill 
dropped from 73 percent to 38 percent 

in response to Brown’s wording. He 
added that withdrawing the act for a 
rewrite would allow the wording to be 
more specific, and said the coalition 
would be working to revamp support 
for the new wording of the act. 

“Unfortunately, what we discovered 
in polls we had taken is that, not only 
is the language that the attorney gen-
eral submitted incredibly misleading, 
[but] there is also a lot of party politics 
involved with the act,” he said. 

Ah San said the legislative approv-
al process — including collecting 
new signatures — must begin from 
scratch for the new wording. 

“Legally, we can’t use the same 
signatures that we already collected 
because they were used for a different 
ballot summary,” San said.

The UCSD chapter of the coali-

tion is also working to increase sup-
port on campus: Chapter director 
and A.S. President-elect Wafa Ben 
Hassine said she is trying to raise 
new awareness, because the act will 
be vital to widespread accessibility to 
higher education. 

“My biggest concern is seeing 
affordable education available for 
everyone,” Ben Hassine said.

Lakoff said he plans to raise 
money to pay professional signature-
gatherers. However, if the required 
signatures are not received, the act 
may carry over to the next election. 

“This is going to be an ongoing 
educational process, whether it quali-
fies for this year or not,” Lakoff said.

certify that the co-ops are beneficial to 
the student body by verifying that they 
are financially sound, maintain quality 
of service and products, and are allow-
ing students input in co-op managing.

GSA President Alex James said he 
is not concerned with the co-ops’ abil-
ity to meet those terms.

“[If they are not financially sol-
vent] we’ll have to come to different 
terms in their agreement,” James said. 

“I don’t know any reason why anyone 
would have concern for lack of solven-
cy. I wouldn’t worry about the co-ops 
being closed or anything.”

A.S. President Utsav Gupta said 
the council will play a mediating 
role between the co-ops and UCAB, 
should conflict arise.

“I don’t see it as necessarily cer-
tifying,” Gupta said. “I think all we 
do is agree to mediate any concerns 
between University Centers and the 

co-operatives. I don’t think we’d ever 
be in a position of not signing off on 
the co-ops.”

The co-op leases will be discussed 
on Friday, when the union members 
meet with Terzino, a second UCAB 
representative, Gupta and James.

HIATUS PICKS THE WEEK’S BEST BETS

WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG/HIATUS  

Two weeks ago, my friend Andrew and I trekked to San Francisco to attend Wondercon: part of the 
Comic-Con family, and a chance for 
aspiring writers and artists like us to 
show all our dorkus peers we exist. 

Our trip began on Friday night, 
but I spent that morning complet-
ing my ongoing mini-comic, which 
was to act as my business card for 
the convention. I spent the entire 
day writing, drawing, copying and 
printing out 100 of those suckers in 
preparation for the convention, while 
my girlfriend acted as moral sup-
port, editor and even disciplinarian 

throughout the entire process.
When I finished, I met Andrew 

in LA, and we started the long drive 
up north. We spent much of our 
trip discussing the absurdities of life 
while listening to radio alt-rock and 
’60s classics. While Andrew drove, 
I sat in the backseat, folding and 
stapling my comics. We made a pit 
stop in Cambria for the night before 
we continued to San Francisco and 
Wondercon — a gathering of geeks in 
a city of hipsters. 

To get a better idea of Wondercon, 
you need a base idea of Comic-Con. 
Over the years, Comic-Con has 
become one of the world’s most widely 
attended media events. It’s heaven for 
anyone who loves video games, mov-
ies, television shows and/or comics 
— everyone, these days. Wondercon, 
though, is catered to the collectors — 
the diehards who can’t let a culture go. 
Everything from toys to Lou Ferrigno 
to that dude who wore the Chewbacca 
outfit are put on parade. 

After a quick stroll through the 
exhibition, we finally got to hustling 
— or, as Andrew would say, “doin’ 
work.” We walked among fellow art-
ists, passing out comics and introduc-
ing ourselves as a creative team. This 
is harder than it sounds — not unlike 
approaching the popular kids in high 
school and asking them to watch “Star 
Wars” with you. But once we got into 
the swing of things, it got easier. Some 
artists even asked us if we had our own 
table set up, assuming we were one of 
them, which was flattering. After we 
made our rounds, we took one more 
pass at the exhibition floor and called 
it a day. The only downside to the trip 
was a flat tire on the way back home.

We did learn a few lessons, though. 
For one, the people our comic would 
cater to in the real world were not 
present at Wondercon. (We prob-
ably should have done the trip to the 
Alternative Press Expo.)

Secondly, we’re not the only ones 
on the hustle. Everyone and their 
mother is doing the same thing. If we 
want to be anybody in these parts, 
then we best be damn sure that we’re 
doing our work properly.

And third, success is a point of 
view. So many artists working on the 
same platform swing the pendulum 
between happy and miserable. I real-
ized that if we are to be happy at all, 
we need to be happy with the fruits 
of our labor. If not, then we’ll never 
be happy no matter how much good 
comes out of our work. My day could 
have been ruined by the bad feedback 
I got for my comic, but instead, my 
day was made by the effort I put into 
it. In Andrew’s words: “That was such 
a good idea.”

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 7 

I f you walked past the door to second-year Noah Doely’s studio without stepping in, you had little choice but to 
double-take. His room contained a tower 
of Victorian cupboards and boxes stacked 
like a snowman with a brightly colored 
bird perched on top. Every door and 
drawer was cracked open to reveal glass 
vials and bits of coral — a child’s treasure 
trove of assorted knickknacks.

Except for the brass birdcages near the 
top and a few rusted measuring instru-
ments, the entire structure was vibrant: 
The cupboards looked as smooth as balsa 
wood, and the animal skulls were pristine 

as chalk. According to Doely, though, the 
piece is far from finished. He said he envi-
sions his final product in the form of an 
antique sepia photograph, with the tower 
slung across a costumed wanderer’s back. 
While it would seem that such a photo 
might disclude the intricate details, Doely 
test photos captured almost everything — 
down to tiny butterflies pressed onto glass 
plates. He’s certainly had plenty of prac-
tice: His portfolio is full of similar faux-
antique photos. Still, seeing the structure 
live is the best way to fully appreciate all 
its elements — including one particular 
vial, half-full of Doely’s own baby teeth.

A t the Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions benefit in February — as part of second-year Elle 
Mehrmand’s performance piece 
“Technésexual” — she and UCSD gradu-
ate Micha Cárdenas tapped away at their 
laptops on stage. A video of the virtual 
space in which their avatars exist was 
projected onto a screen behind them.

Minutes later, as Mehrmand reached 
down to Cárdenas’ naked crotch — grop-
ing and grinding in front of a crowd of 
over 100 — their avatars did the same.

Their amplified heartbeats, whose 
pitches were modulated by the room’s 
temperature, were shared with three audi-
ences: the artists, their live audience and 
all those on Second Life.

Mehrmand said “Technésexual” 

explores how partners share their sexual 
experiences with each other and in multi-
ple worlds, in reality and through technol-
ogy. But her explanation doesn’t end there.

“If you’re a cat making out with a 
cyborg woman, what’s your sexuality?” 
Cárdenas said, referring to their avatars. 
Last year, Cárdenas used Second Life 
in her performance piece “Becoming 
Dragon” to question binary constructions 
of gender.

Mehrmand’s real-life relationship 
with Cárdenas, a transgender woman, 
is equally difficult to categorize, making 
video replays of “Technésexual” personal 
and intimate even after their clothes 
come back on.

Critical      Hit!

TRANSURBANIAC

See OPEN STUDIOS, page 9
JOHN HANACEK/GUARDIAN

The latest exhibit at the University Art Gallery is a collection of pieces from Mexican artists, with an 
emphasis on modernity and urban space 
— a brainchild of UCSD visual-arts pro-
fessor Ruben Ortiz-Torres.

Accordingly, the installations are heavy 
on themes of construction and the world 
of outside influences on Mexican culture. 
Ortiz-Torres explained that artists from 
Mexico City are less concerned about rep-
resenting their culture than they are about 
depicting the globalization of the metro-
politan capital of Mexico.

“There is this idea that tends to be 
exported about what Mexican art is,” 
Torres said. “That it’s based on this recon-
struction of the past and national identity 
— but a lot of young artists aren’t interest-
ed in that. Mexico City is a very polluted, 
cosmopolitan city.”

Studio traditionalists beware: 
“Transurbaniac” is unconcerned with fas-
tidious detail or clean accuracy. Most of the 
exhibits feature unconventional manipu-
lations of materials like ornate wooden 
panels, shoes and horsehair. Each involved 
item is placed around the bleak white space

MGMT
Congratulations
SONY/COLUMBIA

S tumbling awk-wardly on the red carpet at the 
Grammys last January, the mem-
bers of MGMT slid right into the 
unfortunate, disgruntled indie-band 
stereotype they seemed destined 
for since the day “Time to Pretend” 
began infiltrating deejay playlists. 
During the band’s interviews, lead 
singer Andrew VanWyngarden’s 
painful unease in the wake of the 
group’s sudden commercial success 
gave him the air of an electro-pop 
revival of Kurt Cobain.

And with the arrival of sopho-
more effort Congratulations, the 
band’s mole-like introversion has 
only gotten worse. 

It’s as if MGMT decided to make 
the In Utero to their Nevermind. 
Unlike catchy debut Oracular 
Spectacular, the band’s latest is defi-
antly anti-commercial, strange and 
ultimately polarizing. 

All those looking for a memorable 
hummer like 2008 blockbuster “Kids” 
can go home now. In fact, the group 
has abandoned the idea of singles alto-
gether — because the art of the album 
should be appreciated as a whole, 
of course. The lovable poppiness 
that made MGMT famous has been 
chucked for the drones of psychedelic 
rock that were hinted at on Oracular. 

On many tracks, though, the 

band’s new formula is oddly suc-
cessful. Despite its disjointed nature, 
“Flash Delirium” is unusually catchy. 
The track begins in familiar tuneful 
territory, but evolves into moments 
of doo-wop and surf-rock, ending 
in a clattering and chaotic stream 
of nonsensical phrases and unintel-
ligible ideas about spiders, freedom 
and commerce. Rad.

Other highlights include wonky 
homage “Brian Eno” and titular 
track “Congratulations.” Like a cut 
off David Bowie’s Heroes, the latter 
is a deconstructed power ballad — a 
sign that maybe there is more to 
MGMT than indie-radio hits and 
peculiar experimentation. 

Less appealing are tracks like 
instrumental “Lady Dada’s Nightmare,” 
whose only vocals come in the form of 
a distant, terrifying scream. 

Despite a scattering of failed 
experiments, Congratulations will 
likely grow in appeal over time, as 
many force enough listens to find 
something innovative and exciting 
within its trippy wails. Many more, 
however, will mope in memory of the 
synthy grooves that made the band’s 
first album so much fun.

Fatboy Slim & David Byrne
Here Lies Love
TODO MUNDO/ NONESUCH

H ere Lies Love — a collaboration between David Byrne of the Talking Heads and big-beat ’90s 
icon Fatboy Slim — disproves a com-
mon musical myth: that talented art-
ists in collaboration will create work 
far greater than anything they could 
have made alone.

Instead of the decade’s best collab, 
Cyndi Lauper plus Roisin Murphy 
plus Sia plus Florence Welch plus 
Santigold plus Camille equals a 
misguided homogenization of over-
wrought aesthetics.

The album’s 22 tracks romanticize 
the life of Filipino First Lady Imelda 
Marcos, from her impoverished 

beginnings to last meditations. It’s 
pumped with star power, but — 
instead of pushing its artists to think 
outside their routines — it seems Slim 
and Byrne looped one disco track and 
ordered their rent-a-voices to impro-
vise some bland melody on top.

“Here Lies Love” is the first of 
many extravagant, upbeat pieces, 
with soaring vocals over strings, a 
syncopated rhythm and jaunty horns. 
As an intro, its complex strains and 
brash vocals demand attention, but 
the track soon becomes forgettable 
over a sea of identical songs. 

In “You’ll Be Taken Care Of ” — 
told from the perspective of Marcos’ 

devoted housekeeper — Tori Amos’ 
signature breathy gnarls are mis-
used to comedic effect, making her 
character into an evil and conniving 
beast.

“Don’t You Agree” makes the hip-
hop sentiments of Roisin Murphy 
(of electronic act Moloko) sound just 
like Amos, Welch and Sia, and even 
Cyndi Lauper’s “Eleven Days” blends 
into the mush. Each individual track 
has its few merits, but together, they 
become a numbingly mundane pop 
cacophony that leaves us yearning for 
golden silence.

‘Die By the Drop’
Dead Weather
THIRD MAN

J ack White is normally all about simplicity, but with supergroup Dead Weather, he’s proving his trademark riff-driven guitar style can work within 
a heavier and more complex format. One lone recur-
ring piano note kicks off “Die By the Drop,” soon joined 
by White’s staccato riff to form a foot-tapping intro 
that’s busting with repressed energy. Alison Mosshart’s 
restrained vocals keep the track pent up for a few more 
verses before White’s roar explodes onto our speakers 
like a tsunami. A sweeping guitar hook leads us into a 
maniacal chorus while White and Mosshart pass the mic 
back and forth for a battle of personalities. The contrast 
is superb, and atop White’s addictive guitar work, the 
result is a heavier, grittier version of White Stripes fare.

I f you listen to alt-rock radio, you’ve heard Kentucky indie-rockers Cage the Elephant play their ridiculously catchy “Ain’t No Rest for the Wicked.” And admit it: You 
totally sing along. “In One Ear,” a re-release of their pre-
breakout single, looks like it will be just as popular — the 
track was clearly written with summer road trips in mind. 
With an embarrassing amount of attitude, lead singer Matt 
Shultz sprays his nasally voice over fast-paced, blues-tinged 
guitar riffs, as if Mick Jagger and Jack White got together 
to get loose on some G. Love rhymes. His lyrics are obvi-
ously anecdotal (“It goes in one ear and right out the other/ 
People talkin’ shit, they can kiss the back of my hand”), but 
the identifiable refrain about ignoring haters and doing what 
you love saves the track from overt egocentricity.

in an almost haphazard manner that, 
at first glance, doesn’t really seem to 
merit the esoteric title of high art — 
let alone a spot in a gallery. 

The aforementioned horsehair is 
featured prominently in Pablo Vargas 
Lugo’s piece “Snoop 2” — what seems 
to be a fiberglass 
mold of a rocket, 
paired with a halo 
of horse-weave. 
The weave hangs 
menacingly over 
the fiberglass 
and the viewer. 
Though Lugo 
appears to have 
been aiming for a juxtaposition of the 
traditional with the modern, the piece 
leaves a lot to the imagination, espe-
cially with such a mystifying title.

Much of the remaining exhibit is, 
like “Snoop 2,” puzzling to the point 
of alienation. However, Jerónimo 
Hagerman’s video installation — 
“Because The World Is Round it 
Turns Me On”— projects a captivat-

ing stream of Mexican people and 
places, focusing on imagery and 
song rather than dialogue. A dark 
room with a door envelops the 
viewer and narrows the field of focus 
on the film’s vivid message.

Another reprieve are Rubén 
Gutiérrez’ “Objects over Havana” 

photographs, which 
deliver a calm-
ing simplicity to 
“Transurbaniac.” 
A series of images 
that cleverly avoid 
faces and other 
identifying human 
features aim to 
depict Mexico 

City’s complex cityscape, clarifying 
the exhibit’s focus on the moderniza-
tion of culture.

While many of the pieces would 
have been better received with the 
simple addition of a more explicit 
title (or even the availability of a 
Spanish-to-English dictionary), fall-
ing down this rabbit hole is overall 
an enlightening experience.

FILMREVIEW

By Poonam Mantha
Contributing Writer

B ased on the comic-book series by Mark Millar, “Kick-Ass” is the perfect blend of art and 
trash. Carefully choreographed action 
sequences 
explode on 
screen, right 
before an 11-year-
old drops the 
C-bomb and cuts 
off a drug dealer’s 
leg. It’s the type 
of film that feeds 
off of the worst 
in human nature 
— a soggy gas-station burrito for the 
brain. It’s brazen, wild and politically 
incorrect, and one of the most awe-
some/hysterical films of 2010.

The story revolves around a dis-
satisfied high-school nerd (Aaron 
Johnson) who sets off to become a 
masked vigilante despite a total lack of 
superpowers, training or social skills. 
He buys a painfully unflattering green-
and-yellow costume, then prowls the 
streets of New York City under quaint 
moniker Kick-Ass.

The boy’s delusions render him 
fearless as he walks into an apartment 
full of hustlers with nothing but a 
taser — and fully expects to come out 
of the situation alive. It is here that 
he encounters his saviors and true 
superheroes, Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz) 

and her adoring 
father Big Daddy 
(Nicolas Cage) — 
a Batman ripoff 
seeking justice in 
a corrupt world. 

The film’s 
appeal hits home 
in the brief 
moment when 
we finally begin 

to believe that our anti-hero’s fame 
might be possible. Capitalizing on an 
age when a shtick and a nice video 
camera can make anyone a celebrity 
overnight, Kick-Ass is catapulted to 
fame courtesy of YouTube. However, 
his fellow Internet vigilante Red Mist 
(Christopher Mintz-Plasse) has a 
shadier vision for his fame.

Newcomer Johnson is convincing 
as a pathetic nerd just likable enough 
to root for. But the film’s true star is 
Moretz, whose character is trained 

by her father to be a shockingly vul-
gar and violent killer. She’s a tiny but 
deadly weapon, and — although she 
leads the most intense and climactic 
fight sequence of the film — she never 
wavers. Cage is surprisingly tolerable as 
well, but only because his cowlicks are 
tamed and he shares every scene with 
the talented Moretz.

Mintz-Plasse, of McLovin fame, 
is typecast as the socially awkward 
nerd with a prepubescent squeak and 
doughy jowls; the result is as funny as 
always, but he never leaves the shadow 
of his mile-a-minute castmates.

On a whole, the film does end up 
suffering from lack of focus. The trail-
ers advertise “Kick-Ass” as an epic 
about an average guy trying to save the 
world, but vicious, drawn-out action 
sequences descend the film into mad-
ness. Luckily, it’s damn entertaining. 
Director Matthew Vaughn saves his 
baby from becoming a total farce by 
aligning hilarity with startlingly seri-
ous combat and a relatively heartfelt 
premise. He may have sucked the life 
out of Neil Gaiman’s “Stardust,” but he 
manages to breathe a tangible energy 
into “Kick-As” — and turns out some 
dark comedy for the ages.

Following her themed collection of channeling the dead, first-year Vabianna 
Santos adopted a persona obsessed with puppets shaped like the heads of 
famous young rockers who committed suicide. The persona, she said, allows 
her to “channel them with my own fan-ness and my own sexuality.”

However, she then revealed that “the plan is to make out with them.”
Seeing as the Open Studios installations were works in progress, Santos 

wasn’t doing any lip-locking this past weekend — that’ll happen in a video 
slated for later this year. So far, the melon-sized puppets with Pac-Man 
mouths (think of a cross between a decapitated Bert and a sock puppet) sit 
actionless between unlit candles. In the background, a trio of dolls dutifully 
carried out a list of robotic instructions emanating from a nearby speaker in 
Vabianna’s sepulcher-like studio

The red mouths of the heads — and the red bags on which the heads sat 
— were a striking contrast to the black-and-white photos of the rockers’ faces, 
hastily fastened to the puppets’ heads. Their mouths were agape, but whether 
the puppets were stuck in song or frozen in mid-scream — perhaps at the 
thought of an obsessive super-fan tongue-kissing their spirits — remains up 
for interpretation.

along with Azzi and Takahashi, each added two 
goals to the Triton score.

Nguyen, reflecting on the season, said the 
team’s young talent promises more successful 
future seasons.

“We have a really young team this year,” 
Nguyen said. “Our girls have a lot of indi-
vidual talent that is only going to grow as they 
gain more experience playing and competing 
during the season. It was a hard week and 
we played some tough teams, but I think we 

improved a lot and played well this weekend.” 
Junior captain Jessica Greiner shared 

Nguyen’s optimism.
“We’ve learned a lot this season, and I’m 

excited to see what we can do going into next 
year,” Greiner said. “We just need to develop 
our new recruits and work on building our 
team, so that next year we will be a force to be 
reckoned with.”

the Tritons took the lead thanks to junior out-
fielder Katrin Gabriel, who stole home. 

Unfortunately, Gabriel was the only Triton to 
cross home plate: Lumberjack freshman pitcher 
Vaneza Hoover held strong over seven innings, 
allowing only the one run. The Lumberjacks 
then managed two runs in the bottom of the 
sixth inning against Triton sophomore pitcher 
Tess Granath, and evened the series with a 2-1 
win.

Saari said the Tritons’ offense was fatally 
shaky heading into the second doubleheader.

“We need to be consistent offensively and 
continue to score,” Saari said. “Our defense is 
solid.” 

Game One of Saturday’s doubleheader was 
largely uneventful through the early innings, 
but exploded with life later on. At the top of 
the fifth inning, with the score tied 1-1, junior 
infielder Sarah Woofter scored a game-changing 
run thanks to Spangler’s RBI single — putting 
the Tritons in the lead. The Tritons pushed two 
more runs to the plate while the Lumberjacks 
only squeezed one out. 

In the sixth inning, UCSD extended its 
lead with three more runs. Gabriel scored off  
Ousley’s single, and Saari and Woofter were 
batted in by Spangler, who went three-for-four 
from the plate. 

On the defensive side, Gaito posted an 
1.83 earned run average and struck out 13 
Lumberjack hitters, shutting down Humboldt 
for the last two innings and securing the 7-2 
Triton win. 

However, the team was unable to stay on top 
in the fourth game and had already allowed a 
two-run Humboldt lead by the end of the first 
inning. The Tritons lacked the stamina they 
showed in the game before, and — coming 
through for only one late run in the sixth inning 
— they lost 5-1. 

Head coach Patti Gerckens noted the team’s 
inability to score in the latter halves of both 
doubleheaders.

“Our bats came alive in the first game of each 
day,” Gerckens said. “But they were quiet in the 
second game.”

The Tritons’ series split against Humboldt 
makes their upcoming games even more 
important. Their series against Cal State 
Monterey Bay — from April 16 to April 17 — 
and Cal State San Bernardino — from April 
23 to April 24 — will determine whether or 
not UCSD plays in the CCAA Championship 
Tournament, which takes place in Stockton, 
Calif., from April 30 to May 2.

“We just need to keep focusing on the little 
things,” Gerckens said. “Do routine plays, stay 
calm and have composure during pressure situ-
ations.” 

UCSD currently stands in third place in the 
CCAA with a 27-15 overall record and 17-11 
in conference. The upcoming series against Cal 
State Monterey Bay on April 16 and April 17 
will be UCSD’s last home play of the regular 
season.

32-34 and 30-27 in a grueling four-set match.  
The Tritons fell behind early when the 

Bruins grabbed a quick first-set lead. However, 
UCSD battled back to a 17-16 lead, thanks to 
senior opposite hitter Frank Fritsch. The two 
teams continued neck-and-neck until UCSD 
took the set at 30-26 after a UCLA error.

The second set proved even more unpre-
dictable: The Tritons and Bruins battled 
through 14 ties and seven lead changes. Then, 
two consecutive UCLA errors followed by 
a Spangler ace gave the Tritons a 22-19 lead 
they held tight for the duration of the second 
set. UCSD pushed through to the end for a 
30-25 win. The set point was punctuated by an 
emphatic Fritsch kill.

UCSD started off the third set strong, mak-
ing a straight-set upset look possible. But, the 
Bruins fought back harder than ever to take a 
23-20 lead. 

The Tritons did not relent, and stole back 
the lead at 30-29; however, facing match point, 
UCLA scraped through to claim the set 34-32 
on a service ace.

The fourth and final set began with a vola-
tile competitiveness reminiscent of the second 
— the teams battled through 18 ties and seven 

lead changes. Two Fritsch kills broke a 27-27 
tie to set up a match point for the Tritons, 
who proceeded to convert and take the final 
set 30-27. The Bruin beating was the Tritons’ 
second victory over UCLA out of three meet-
ings this season.

In the match, Spangler served his 81st career 
service ace, making him UCSD’s all-time lead-
er. Spangler said the team’s win against UCLA 
was due to an ability to string passes together 
— something he says the Tritons struggled 
with against Irvine.

“Compared to the night before, we passed 
better — that was the key difference,” Spangler 
said. “We built up our offense this time. We 
were more confident. The crowd helped. The 
past three years we have been close to UCLA, 
so there is always some excitement and motiva-
tion to play well.” 

The Tritons will return to action on April 
14 when they host Cal Baptist. Then on, April 
16 and April 17, they will round off their sea-
son at RIMAC Arena against the University 
of Southern California and Pepperdine 
University, respectively.

WOMEN’S CLUB LACROSSE 
—  UCSD pushed through a tough 
three-game stretch last week to con-
clude what has turned out to be a 
difficult season for the Tritons who 
finished their year 3-13 overall.

On April 7, they faced rival San 
Diego State on their home field. 
Prior to the game, UCSD head coach 
Lindsay Barton said she was optimis-
tic about the team’s chances.

“We have a strong team this sea-
son,” Barton said. “This is the year 
that we could beat San Diego State. If 
the girls come out ready to play and 
keep their momentum going into the 
second half, this should be a good 
game.” 

As Barton predicted, the team 
came out in attack mode. Freshman 
Maddie DeLoria led the UCSD 
offense, scoring four goals during 
the first half. However, the Tritons 
were shut down in the second half 
when the Aztecs went on an offensive 
tear, and the girls went home with a 
19-6 loss. 

Team morale was low going into 
the weekend after Wednesday night’s 
loss, but the team sucked it up for 
its final two home games of the sea-
son, against Arizona State and the 
University of Arizona, on April 10 
and April 11, respectively. 

Junior midfielder Tamara 
Schroeder said that her team would 
have to put its loss to the Aztecs 
behind them to ensure victory in the 
upcoming games.

“It’s going to be really hard to 
keep team spirits high this weekend 
after losing to State,” Schroeder said. 
“We just need to focus on keeping 
our heads up and playing hard no 
matter what.”

Saturday’s game against the Sun 
Devils showcased a world of improve-
ment from the lady Tritons — but the 
effort was not enough to secure a win 
against a resilient Arizona State.

The Tritons were able to stay 
within a few goals until the end of 
the second half, when Arizona State 
cranked up its offense and put the 
game away with back-to-back break-
away goals, leaving with a final score 
of 19-9. 

Schroeder scored three goals to 
lead the Tritons, while sophomore 
Victoria Azzi and freshman Caitlin 
Takahashi added two goals apiece 
against the Sun Devils. UCSD saw a 
significant setback in the game when 
sophomore midfielder Stephanie 
Gerretsen suffered a knee injury in 
the first half; Gerretsen, a regular 
starter and one of UCSD’s key play-
ers, was sidelined for the rest of the 
weekend. 

Sunday morning’s game against 
the University of Arizona was the 
Tritons’ last chance for redemption. 
However, once more, the team came 
out strong during the first half — 
nearly matching the Wildcats goal 
for goal — but let Arizona break 
away with the lead in the second half. 
The game ended in a 19-11 loss for 
UCSD. 

Junior captain Monica Nguyen, 

UCSD hosted a showdown against No. 10 UC Irvine on April 9, looking to reverse a losing trend 
against the visiting Anteaters. The neigh-
boring UC had defeated the Tritons four 
times over two years. So, last Friday, the 
Tritons flooded their home courts deter-
mined to bring the heat.  

However, their spurt of determination 
was no match for the Anteaters’ consistent 
skill and the Tritons fell 30-23, 30-13, 
30-21.

UCSD was jittery from the start, com-
mitting 12 attacking errors in the opening 
set — seven more than Irvine. Although 
the two teams initially kept the score tight, 
the Anteaters broke open a 9-9 tie with a 
10-4 run, and eventually won the set 30-23.

UCSD committed fewer errors in the 
second set, but was unprepared for a spec-
tacular offensive barrage from UC Irvine, 
who registered a .667 hitting average to 
claim the set 30-13.

In the third set, the Anteaters hit at 
.433 and jumped out to an early lead. The 
Tritons, struggling to cope with the oppos-
ing team’s offense, nearly tied the set at 
23-21, but UC Irvine pushed through to 
score the game’s final seven points and win 
the third set 30-21.

The Triton offense — combining for a 
.053 hitting average, dwarfed by Irvine’s 
.416 average — was anemic. Moreover, the 
Tritons were out-blocked by the Anteaters 
17.5 to 7.0.

Individually, however a few UCSD 

players still delivered sizable contribu-
tions throughout the game. Junior middle 
blocker Adrian Guthals made 10 kills on 
.467 hitting, and senior outside hitter Jason 
Spangler and sophomore middle blocker 
Cyrus Kiani earned 11 kills combined. 
Senior setter Phil Bannan had 28 assists 
and seven digs, and sophomore libero 
Andrew Kaban added nine digs.

The team had little time to dwell on 
their crushing Friday night defeat. On April 
10, No. 7 UCLA came to RIMAC Arena 
hoping to capitalize on the Tritons’ recent 
troubles. However, in a surprise comeback, 
the Tritons rebounded from their Anteater 
beatdown by toppling UCLA 30-26, 30-25,

SOFTBALL — With only three series remaining in 
the California Collegiate Athletic Association regu-
lar season, UCSD entered its final four-game series 
against Humboldt State University last week. The 
Tritons were looking to solidify their spot at the con-
ference playoffs — only possible if they could hold 
onto a No. 3 or No. 4 conference ranking. However, 
after a series split at Humboldt, the Tritons’ seat in 
the playoffs remains a questions mark. 

 “The pressure is on now with each game,” senior 
captain Nicole Saari said. “We need to bring our 
A-game every time.”

Game One of the first doubleheader took place 
on Friday. The Tritons jumped out to an early lead: 
In the second inning, junior outfielder Rhiannon 
Ousley scored on junior infielder Jennifer De Fazio’s 
double to make UCSD first on the board. Buoyed by 
junior centerfielder Kris Lesovsky, who went three-
for-four with two scores and two runs batted in, the 
Tritons tacked on four more runs.

Triton defense was tight as well, only allowing the 
Lumberjacks one run throughout the entire game 
— despite the fact that sophomore pitcher Camille 
Gaito’s allowed eight hits.

In the second game, after four scoreless innings,
