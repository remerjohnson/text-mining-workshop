Chancellor 
By Jeff Bereeford·Howe 

NeWi Editor 
If two faculty votes of "no confidence" in the 
a~ministration weren't enough, one faculty member 
thinks he knows what brought on the resignation 
Aug. 13 of Chancellor WaIiam McFJroy. 

"The chancellor didn't do anything for seven 
years," he said. "Then, after the faculty voted 
against him, he seemed determined to go out and be 
chanceUor, That's what caused the presaure to get 
him to resign, 
"The chancellor tried to play chancellor, and he was 
playing the game too seriously, without consideering 
the implications of the votes ." •

McfJroy told a preu conference after the second 
vote (which he lost 360-219) that he "had not 
considered resigning," and would not do 80. 

But pressure on his administration built during the 
summer. and the resolutions. which mo.t faculty 
~m"':rs h~ th?ught, would force McfJroy's 
munediate resignation, finally caught up with him. 

Between the votes and the resignation aix of the 
last seven Senate chairs siped a Jetter asking for the 
chancellor'. resignation, and the ,CoUncil of UC

Fnday, McFJroy qwetly flew north for his own 
conference, That Monday, he resigned.

Though faculty members contend that their 
ant!lRonism t~ McfJroy is several years old, it wasn't ' 
until ,last ~prmg t~at ~ Se,:,ate began to fonnally

McfJroy tried to reorganize the offices of Paul 
Salbnan (vice chancellor of academic affairs) and 
Ma,nny Rotenberg (dean of graduate studies) by 

t~~g ~sponsibility for research from Saltman and 
glvmg It to Rotenberg, 

When he announced the move, MeFJroy claimed 
that ~ ha~ ~n conaidering it for months, and that in 

a stnwar proposal had been put forth and 
lat)jancjlon4ec! several years ago. 

But Seltman was outraged. He told a dosed 
emergency meeting of the Senate's executive board 
that he wo~ reaip if McElroy went through with the 
plan, and charged that he and other vice chancellors 
had not been consulted before the decision

leaving only the graduate students and Associated 
Students to appoint one representative each and for 
Saxon to choose five faculty members (th:ee from 
UCSD) out of 17 nominations from the statewide 
Senate. 

McfJroy believes faculty membera wiD determine 
how effective the new chancellor will be - "whether

Marcuse, 'Leader of New Left,' Dies 
Prof Was 
Center of 
Storm Here 

By Katherine Hafner 
Staff Writer 

Dr. Herbert Marcuse. the 
philosopher whose impact on 
intellectual thought in this 

. century gained him worldwide 
recognition, died on July 29 in 
Starnberg, Germany, ten days 
after his 81st birthday. 

Described by Dr. Henry 
Allison, philosophy department 
chairman as "the intellectual 
leader of the New Left," 
Marcuse was most famous for 
the political and scholarly work 
that he did in the '60s, marked 
by the publication of his One-
Dimensional Man . 

Catherine Asmann, Mar-
cuse's personal secretary and 
close friend , described him as "a 
kind person who took time to 
care in spite of the fact that he 
was so well-known ." 

Born in Berlin in 1898, 
Marcuse was the son of a 
prominent couple, Karl and 
Gertrud (Kreslawsky) Marcuse. 
He attended tbe Augusta 
Gymr.asium in Berlin, and 
received his Ph.D. Magna Cum 
Laude from the Universities of 
Freiburg and Berlin in 1922. 

His first book, published in 
Frankfurt in 1932, was 
developed from his post-
doctoral re.earch on Hegel's 
ontology and theory of history. 

With Theodor Adomo and 
Max Horkheimer, Marcuse 
founded the Frankfurt Institute 
of Social Research (later known 
aa the Frankfurt School), which 
became a frequent target of 
Nazi harassment. 

When Hitler 81.wned power 
-m 1933. MarCUle Red to 
Geneva. He came to the United 
States in 1934 a. a lecturer at 
Columbia Univer.ity in New 
York City and aix years later 
became a United States citizen. 

During World War II. 
MarcUie lerved with Franz 
Neumann 81 a European 
intelligence analy.t in the U.S. 
Army'l Office of , Strategic 
Services. the forerunner of the 
Central Intelligence Agency. 
After the war. when the focus of 

. the agency'. operations shilted 
to the Soviet Union. Marcuse 
worked for fotir years 81 the 
chief of ita central European 
lection. 

MarcUie became a research 
fellow with the RUilian Institute 
at Columbia in 1951; the 
foHowing academic year he 
lectured in the Ruuian 
Research Center at Harvard. 

In 1954 Marc~ accepted 
an offer to join the faculty of 
Brandei. University in 
Waltham. Masaachusetls, 
teaching philosophy ansi 
political science. 

Ten year. later, in 1964, 
Marcuse published his best-
selling One-Dimensional Man , 
a sharp critique of modern 
society which, says Allison, 
"has become the ltandard term 
for the malaise of modern man 
in a technological world." 

the IOrt of society which shouid 
emerge from "revolutionary 

" . movements. . 
Acknowledging his critics, 

MarcUie .aid, "I can't give you 
an exact blueprint of the free 
society, since I am not a 
prophet. Generally, it will be a 
society where there would be 
freedom and justice for all, in 
actual practice, and not only as 
values which we profess today. 
A free people will be free to 
choose the kind 01 government 
they really want." 

When aaked by The New 
York Times Magazine in 1969 
whether he con.idered himself a 
free man, he replied "Me? I 
believe nobody is free in this 
society. Nobody." 

Eros and Civilizalion, 
published in 1955, is considered 
by many to be Marcuse's 
greatest philosophical work, his 
most complete presentation of 
his ideas on the aspect of social 
and political repression. 

With Robert Paul Wolff and 
Barrington Moore. Jr. Marcuse 

wrote A Critique of Pure 
Tolerance (1965) . His 
contribution to the book W8lthe 
essay "Repressive Tolerance," 
which criticized the liberal idea 
of tolerance as an absolute 
value . 

However. critic. of MarcUie 
. considered him a negativist 

becaule. a. Sol Stern wrote in 
Rnmt>arts magazine. he offered 
few positive IUggestions 81 to

contract. "It is worth his 
$20,000 salary to keep him 
away from the students," stated 
conservative assemblyman 
John Stull in August, 1968. 

A six-part resolution adopted 
by the American Legion stated: 
"We abhor and are disgusted 
with the so-called theory that 
freedom of speech permits 
members of a faculty to preach 
those things which could bring 
about the aownfall of our 
country." 

Marcuse. however, said he 
had never invited Dutschke to 
La Jolla, stating that when he 
saw Dutschke in Europe there 
had been no talk of Dutschke'. 
enrolling in the university. "He 
wouldn't think of doing it 
anyway," Marcuse stated, 
"since he already hal a doctoral 
degree." 

"Herbert was .een 8S lOme 
kind of enemy of democracy," 
commented Avrum Stroll. one 
of the founders of the 
philosophy deparbnent and one 
of the men who brought 
. MarcUie to UCSD. "They 
didn't really understand that he 
W81 pro-democratic, but not in 
favor of a democracy that 
fooled or co·opted people." 

When Marcuse received 
several death threats and a note 
calling him "a very dirty 
Communist dog" which gave 
him "72 hours to live in the 
United States, " in July 1968. he 
went into hiding with his second 
wife , Inge. (She died of cancer 
in 1973.) 

The Academic Senate voted 
109·3 to support Marcuse'. 
right to teach. and MarcUie 
attacked his critics. 

"If somebody really believes 
that my opinion. can seriou.ly 
endanger society." stated 
Marcuse. "then he and society 
must be very badly off indeed."

At this public meeting we would like to be 
able to give an adequate representation of his 
international stature as a thinker and teacher, 
and of the enduring significance of his ideas, as 
well as of his importance to us as a friend . 
Marcuse was wdl aware of, and through his

Health Insurance Reduced Significantly

Unless UCSD ltudents are

insurance, they will find 
themaeiVel in need of more 
medical protection than the

Because the optional plan il

explained that each Iludent on

conaultationl, x·rays and 
emergency care not leading to 
hoipitalization, for example, 
are inlured through the 
university, according to Allen. 

UCSD, howevel' , will only 
pay for luch expenlel if 
students first receive a referral 
from the health center, Allen 
stressed. Without prior conlent 
from the center, Itudents'

$35 per quarter to help defray '

Hellinger said. 

About $400,000 has been 
allocated from the univerlity'l 
general financial aid fund to aid 
3,000 students, he said. 
Probleml now and later 

UCSD ran into health 
inlurance Inags this year 
becaUie of rising medical costs 
and because inlurance 
companies "are learning that 
students are not a particularly 
lucrative field," according to 
Allen. 

luch an opportunity IS 
improbable. 

And while university 
insurance coverage is presently 
stable" it may run into trouble 
later in the year if ita funding is 
depleted. . 

Unlike outside insurance 
carriers, "we can go bankrupt," 
Allen laid, Although he 
believes the chances of 
exhausting the university's 
insurance budget is slim, outside 
medical cov,erage may be 
further restricted as funds are 
depleted.

One way the health center 
wants to reduce usage of the

"We are the hollow men 
We are the 5tufled men 
Leaning together 
Headpiece filled with straw . .. 
- T. S. Eliot, "The Hollow 
Men" 

By Mark Stadler 
Special to the Guardian 

If Eliot had been in southern 
California when he wrote that 
famous peom of disillusion· 
ment, he probably would have 
dedicated it to San D~go' s 
politicians. The local political 
scene has, over the past years, 
proven itself as bankrupt as the 
City of Cleveland and as phony 
as the laughs heard on a 
television situation comedy. 

The sad thing is. _ the 
municipal primary elections 
held today aren't going to make 
the situation any better. At best, 
voters today - and in the 
November general ejections -
will only maintain the status 
QUO. 

More likely, though, they will 
continue the rapid slide away 
from the brief brush with 
progressIvism the city 
experienced earlier in this 
decade. 

For a few years, then, Mayor 
Pete Wilson. found it politically 
advantageous to favor land use 
controls. A bare majority on the 
City Council agreed with him. 

The County Board of 
Supervisors, led by maverick 
Republican Jack Walsh, had a 
similar tone, and local liberals 
found a sliver of sunshine in the 
political scene. 

America's Finest City 
actually had a chance at coming 
within a few lightyears 'of 
fulfilling its specious self· 
aP(lOinted label. 

But the same backlash that is 
sweeping the nation - the anti· 
civil rights, pro·war, no freedom 
of choice for women craze -

lq% uhf 
witK· 
st,J)ent 
il) 

has hit San Diego with a 
vengeance. James Copley, the 
reactionary old publisher of the 
San Diego Union and Evening 
Tribune , would be proud of 
Richard Nixon's Finest City 
these days. 

The Progressives ~ke Walsh 
and City Councilman Floyd 
Morrow are but on their ears, 
Ireplaced by neanderthals who 
probably cut tllelr eye teeth on 
the red scare. The political 
dialogue - for a fleeting 
moment widened to include 
most viewpoints - has 
contracted again to range from 
middle·of·the·road to Bircher-
KKK conservatism. 

This year'l city Board of 
Education election I are a 
perfect reflection of thi,' trend. 
The big joke here is that the 
mOlt important integration - is 
hardly ever mentioned in 

K.M.S. NucleoProtein 
Products 

substantive terms by any of the 
candidates. 

Neither the white candidates 
- representing parents with 
kids who don't want to leave 
their neighborhood schools -
nor the black candidates -
representing parents with kids in 
crummy schools - have 
established a meaningful 
discussion of how the city can 
best integrate its schools. 

Rather, the stands of the . 
candidates on this issue range 
from support of the current 
voluritary program to advocacy 
of the Robbins amendment, 
which wou!d prohibit busing to 
achieve integration in state 
schools. 

And, since the candidates are 
agreed in their oppolition to 
mandatory busing of students, 
the most important issue facing 
the city passes undiscussed. 

What will these people do if 
, . « 

they are sitting on the school 
board when the courts order 
San Diego to start mandatory 
busing? 

Believe it , that day is in the 
near future. 

Despite all the hype from city 
school officials and the . local 
dailies, figures show that 
voluntary integration is not 
succeeding to any significant 
measure. It's only a matter of 
time before Judge Louis Welsh 
- who handed down the 
original voluntary integration 
order and is monitoring the 
school system's progress -
decides that the voluntary 
measures are a failure and 
orders mandatory busing. 

Blithely ignoring this reality, 
school board candidates - just 
like current board members -
spend their time talking about 
issues that are, for the mdst 
part, of only peripheral concern. 

GuardUin ~hoto b1 St." 
Discipline of rowdy students 

is a popular topic, as il quality of 
teaching. The way candidates 
discull them, both issues have 
emerged as the "mother and 
apple pie" issues. Who, after all, 
is in favor of school violence? 
What schnook would come out 
against improved teaching? 

These issues are, of course, 
easier to disculII than 
integration. But when 
mandatory busing is ordered, 
an unprepared school board will 
be placed. lquarely on the spot. 
And how they respond to the 
order will in large part determine 
whether San Diego integrates ita 
school in a messy fashion - 5ke 
in Boston or Los Angeles - or 
neatly - i1ce in Louiaville.

has floundered on seas of 
conservatism . The two possible 
heirs to Walsh's position as 
leading liberal light - Jim 
Bates and Roger Hedgecock -
have opted to lead the rightisl ' 
charge on many issues . 

Indeed, Bates and Hedge·

yearn for better jobs, have 
groused that the curren .. cou~ty

How far will this con~rvative 
drift take the city? One clue to 
the answer is tile current 
election. The best candidate

While Casady advocates 
many progressive stands - like

doesn't have a snowball'.

This Is Coffee Hut's . . 
, . I 

Factions Agree: AS ',Runs Facility 
By Kathy Huffer 

The Coffee Hut has been given only one more 
quarter to operate a5 a food facility as the result 
of a compromise made thi5 summer between 
Auociated Students, faculty representatives and 
administrators. 

The food facility, the focus of controversy 
bec:aule of allempts to close it last year, will be 
officially turned over to the AS on Dec. 9, ending 
its chances of conversion into a faculty club. 

And as part of the political maneuverings 
which save students jurisdiction over the Hut, 
Chancellor W~liam McElroy announced last 
week that a Iw1cheon club for faculty will be 
eatablished in the International Center. " 

Agreement was reached between students, 
'aculty and adminiatratora through a Beries of 
proposals and counterproposals during the 
months that public Bentiment and emotion were 
lowest. With the formation of a student/faculty 
ad hoc Coffee Hut committee in August, a deal 
was made which left nearly all contending parties 
.. lislied. 

At issue was the Coffee Hut, which last spring 
was marked by faculty and admini~trators as a 
,potential lite for a faculty dub and wu at the 
same lime claimed by students as their •. 

With an accumulated deficit of $53,000 by 
lall May, the Hut was considered on the brink of 
closure by a1mpst aU involved. Managed by 
.tudents until 1971 and then placed in the hands 
o' Housing al)d Food Services, competition 
aroae over control of the facility. 

"We successfully stifled their efforts," Carlos 
Montalvo, student body president said of the 
f~ and adrniniltrators. "It'. a real victory for 
ltudem." 

The Hut will operate on a limited lunch 
ICheduie this qua .... No definite plans have 
been made for its subeequent Ule, but Montalvo 
aaid the extra student space, FeRuiated by the 
StwIed Cenler Board. will probably be UIed u a 

campus activities cenler at leasl lempolilrily. 
Twenty.five tahles and an expresso machine 

from the Hut will be tr ansferred 10 the new pub as 
one of the firsl visible signs of the compromise. 
The rest of the. Hul's equipmenl will eilher be 
moved to the pub laler or sold .by Housing and 
Food Services, to alleviale the Hut's debt, 
according 10 Montalvo. 

A percenlage of vending revenues not already 
allocated for IItudent use will also be used for thai 
purpose. 

Not all Coffee Hut conlenders are placaled by , 
the August agreement. HoUy Holmes, manager 
of the Hut for almosl a decade, said he "thinks it's 
a disgrace to close lhe place." 

According 10 ' Holmes, the Hut is a favorite 
food facility for students, faculty and 
administralors and Ihe victim of financial 
inequities. 

When Ihe Hut first opened, some food profit's 
were transferred to the Winzer snack bar 10 help 
gel the latter on its feet, he said. Pari of the Hut's 
deficit is the result of this loss, and while the 
deficit "can't go away over nighl, it can go down 
over time," Holmes said. 

Housing and Food Services and 'Montalvo, 
however, believe the Hut will continue to lose 
money and, if not IiOOn discontinued as a food 
facility, will be too expensive for the university to 
handle. 

Holmes charged that Montalvo "turned 180 
degrees left." Last spring, -his p1atfonn was that 
he was going to save the Coffee Hut," Holmes 
said of Montalvo's election campaign. "Carlos 
doesn't say that now." 

Montalvo, however, said Holmes "originally 
supported us because he didn't want the faculty 
to tum the Coffee Hut into a dub." Saying 
Holmes "cid a complete 180," Montalvo said 
the AS lost Holmes' support because ",he' .. now 
acting in hil own besl interests."

Enrollment Down at 
By John Hondros 

AlIOCiate News Editor 
Although UCSD's under. 

graduate population is expected 
to increase by about 80 this fall . 
the number of new students a t 
Third and Warren will drop 
from last year. 

About 8,600 undergradu. 
ates are enrolled at UCSD this 
fall , of which 2,875 are new 
students. UCSD ranks fifth in 
terms of undergraduat e 
enrollment in the University of 
California. 

Due to the "very few" 
redirections in the UC system. 
the amount of applications 
received at Third and Warren 
dec reased this qua rter, 
according to Ronald Bowker, 
UCSD registrar.admissions 
officer. Application. are 
redirected from a .tudent's first 
choice campus to an alternate 
when enrollment quotas have 
been filled. 

Robert Starkey showed that, 
al though there have been 
consistent increases in numbers 
of all minority categories at 
Third, these increases have not 
kept pace with the college's 
growth. 

Acco~ding. to Starkey ' s 
study , ethnic representation 
within Third College dropped 
from 60 percent to 37 percent 
between 1973 and 1978. 
, The changes made in Third's 
graduation requirements , such 
as turning the communications 
and urban/rural studies 
requirements into electives, 
may have "appealed to a group 
of students that didn't want to 
take these required courses," 
explained Starkey. 

The changes may have 
attracted more non· minority 
students to the college, he said.

Third, Warren 

GUllrd"n Photo by Md Oledt Last year. the bulk . of 
redirected applications went to 
Third and Warren because of 
the early enrollment closing 
dates at the other colleges, 
Bowker said. 

Third does not "solicit" 
students in order to increase its 
enrollment as in the past. 
according to a spokeswoman 
for the college. "We used to do a 
lot of visitations 10 high schools, 
but EOP claimed that it was a 
duplication of their service," she 
said. 

Marcuse Dies in Genllany at 81 
On the bright side, Bowker 

believes more of those 4ccepted 
will actually show up, 
because students who have 
been redirected are less likely 'to 
come to school. 

r"ot only is 'Third bringing in 
100 less new students than last 
year , but the percentage of 
minorities at that college has 
dropped as well, said Bowker. 

An enrollment study 
conducted early this year by 
A nalytical Studies Officer 

EOP is the Educational 
OppOrtunity Program. 

Warren Provost Lea Rudee 
isn' t complaining that the 
number of new students at that 
college is down 80 from the 
previous year. "Warren over. 
enrolled last year and, because 
of our staff size, couldn't afford 
to get larger ," he said. 

For this reason, Warren 
closed its enrollment doors 
eartier than usual, Rodee said.

movement should .. . not focus so 
much on so· called free 
universities outside the 
university but.. .try to radicalize 
the departments inside the 
university. " 

Marcuse stepped once again 
into public view when he openly 
supported black militant Angela 
Davis, who had been an 
undergraduate student of his at 
Brandeis and UCSD. ". can't 
overestimate the influence he 
has had on me as a scholar, 
teacher and human being," 

Davis said in a 1968 interview. 
After Davis was charged with 

complicity ill a shooting in a 
courthouse in Marin County, 
California in August 1970, 
Marcuse visited her in jail there. 

After his retirement in 1970, 
Marcuse retained his small 
office on the third floor of the H. 
L Building , taught lome 
seminars and delivered 
occasional lectures . " He was 
working until the very end," 
says Asmann, who typed his 
last book , The A esthetic 
Dimension. in 1978. "He came 

into his office every day and 
wrote or worked for at least five 
or six hours." 

Marcuse's last public lecture 
to the UCSD community on 
April 6 last spring, entitled 
"Negative Dialectics," was a 
memorial lecture on the work of 
Theodor Adorno. 

During Ihe 1978.79 
academic year at UCSD 
Marcuse conducted one tutorial 
and one graduate seminar.

UC Pay Increase 14% Oil Average. As 
Legislature Overrides Veto 
, UC employees received a boost in their 
taIaries for the 1979-80 fiacal year despite 
Governor Brown'. effort during the summer to 
halt the statewide increa.e, 

Academic •• taff and management employees 
will receive. on the average, a 14.5 percent 
aalary increue. according to Campus Budget 
Officer Robert Oakes. 

The ceNt,of living payroll adju.tment, effective 
July 1, rea~dted from state legislative action on 
July 20 .. ~ adju.tments were not reflected in 
UC 1MIY s until August because "the 
Je,illative process took too long," said Oakes. 

'11.e Governor vetoed the item, but the 
Jeaialatwe overrode," he said. 

According to a UC spokeswoman, ave· age 
salary increa.es over last year were allocated 81 
follows: Professors, 15.3 percent; associate 
professors, 13.3 percent; auistant professors, 
12,7 percent; deans and provo"', 13 percent. 

Academic personnel in categories that parallel 
faculty scales, such as professional researchers, 
received the same increa.es as faculty, the 
spokeswoman said. 

Horpi' , technicians, laboratory 

mechanicians, programmers and statisticians 
were the classes of .taff employees receiving 
more than the average 13 percent, while food 
services employees were allocated less, 

Before the range adju.bnents, staff salaries in 
the University trailed prevailing compensation 
by approximatel~ 15 percent, the spokeswoman 
said. 

Nurses at University Hospital received more 
than 13 percent because their salaries were 
"significantly below" the San Oiego county 
hospital average. according to Oakes, "lnere 
are all kinds of open (nursing) positions at 
University Hospital which they haven't been able 
to fill," he said, . 

An average salary adjustment of 13 percent 
will be allocated for management classes. 

"On the surla~e, it looks like a significant 
increase in salary for UC employees, but this 
increase is covering the equivalence of a two· 
year period," said Oakes. "Last year there was 
no cost of livin'g adjl,lstment because of

Chia-Wei WOO and 
'Chips' Drielanger " 

Two new coUege administra -
ton take up their tasks this 
quarter - Revelle'li ProVOlit 
Chia·Wei Woo and Muir's 
Dean Charles "Chips " 
Drielanger, 

Woo is no stranger to UCSD, 
havin!{ worked under Dr. Keilh 
Bruckner here from 1966 to 
1968. 

"My youngest daughter, De· 
Hwei (12), was born here and 
has always considered herself a 
Californian," the theoretical 
physicist said. "Of course she 
was only one (year old) when 
we left for Northwestern 
'(University in Evanston. III.)," 

Woo lell the chair of Physics 
and Astronomy at North-
western to return to La Jolla, 
where he'll be both administra· 
tor and faculty member. 

"I'm really excited to be 
here," the Shanghai native said. 
"I've been very impressed by 
the staff members, colleagues 
and chair-holders I've met so 
lar. I feel I have a lot to learn 
from them.'! 

Woo. who attended high 
school in Hong Kong before 
emigrating to the United States 
in 1955 at age 18. attended 
several American coUeges and 
universities before earning his 
Ph.D. in theoretical physics -
from Washington University 
(St. Louis) in 1966. 

"'Ihe t:ollege system here 
(UCSD) is Il b'l'eat experiment; 
it's unique ," he said. He said 
most olher "college syste m" 
universities have residential 
coUeges rather than academic 
coUega. each with its own 
philosophy and individual 
approach to higher education. 

"I believe this is the luture 
direction in higher education, 
and must be preserved. Of 
course, with a great university 
or a small college there are 
always good and bad points, " 

Woo said, "but I wmelimes 
think there 's too much of a 

cyni~al attitude - people 
concentrate too muc h on 
pointin!{ Ollt the negative and 
don 't pay attention to the 
positive as well. I think you need 
a balance of both," 

However, Woo said he 
currently has no partic ular 
programs to put forth . 

"I have to first learn what the 
job is," he said . " I want to learn 
about all the old ideas before 
creatinl-{ any new ideas." 

He said that currently he and 
his wife, Yvonne, arc looking 
for a home in the area in which 
to live with their son, De·Kai, 
1!l; two daughters , De-Yi, 14, 
and De-Hwei; and his parents. 
The three Woo offspring will 
attend San Diego public schools 
beginning this fall. . 

Muir's new dean, "Chips" 
Dreilanger recently arrived 
from Geneva, N.Y .• where he's 

~en Associate Dean of Hobart 
. College for six years. 

Before his work at Hobart, 
I)reilanger was employed in a 
number of positions including 
Ombudsman, Associate Dean 
of CO'mmunity Services. 
AliSistant Dean 01 Students, 
Assistant Registrar and 
Assistant to the Dean of the 
College at Ohio's Antioch 
College. 

Drielanger earned his 
master's degree in education 
and psychology from 
Claremont Graduate school 
after completing an under-
graduate degree in cultural 
geography at Antioch, 

The briel ' newslette r article 
said the new dean IS 
particularly interested in 
receiving 5ugge!ltions on 
additional ways in which (his 
office) can serve Muir 
students."

Student . -Gove~m~nt, 
15 Lively Years 

By Jeff Beresford Howe 
News Editor 

In 15 years, UCSD has had six different forms of student government. The 
longest lasting of these structures survived eight years, until its self· inflicted death in 
1972. One only lasted a quarter, by its own design , The current model is 
embarking on its third year. 
. B~oad generalizations about the downfall of student government here and the 
Inability of the school to produce a stable government are difficult to make; each 
government has had some particular flaw or crisis which led to its downfall. The 
deficiencies that existed in each previous government model are all burdens carried 
by the current government as it strives to avoid the mistakes of its predecessors and 
establish itself at UCSD. 
The first AS 

The first freshman class entered UCSD in the fall of 1964 but .before they 
attended their initial lecture, preparations for the fonn of student' government had 
been made. 

A group of students led by Larry Baker worked over the summer and 
fOI1T1~lated a. proposal by which an Associated Students (AS) Senate was 
consbtut~. Nine sen~tors, one of whom was elected President by the student body, 
were entirely responSIble for the conduct of governmental affairs. These students 
eventually came to be elected as representatives of their college but Revelle was 
then the only college operating. ' 

When Muir College appeared in the fall of 1968, the senators began their 
college representation, and very quickly Muir's dominance of the UCSD political 
scene, which lasted until last year, began. 

"J?e AS Senate Pn:sident elected in spring, 1968, Tom Shepard, transferred to 
MUIr College before It actually opened, and was joined by three of the senators 
elected that spring. 

. The A~ Senate survived until spring. of 1972, when it collapsed after being faced 
With a Withdrawal of student f~nds. m a referendum in winter of that year, the 
student b~y voted overwhelmmgly (70 percent) to make the Activity Fee (now 
the $6 p~d by students as part of their Registration Fees) voluntary. 

After It became apparent that the vast majority of students would balk at 
supporting the government with their fees, Chancellor McfJroy and the Dean of 
Student Affairs, George Murphy, dissolved the government;but not before some 
controversy over their action arose. , 

T\:te UC Regents re~uired that student elections have a 50 percent turnout 
rate In order to be conSidered legitimate by the administration. The election that 
resulted in the demise of the AS Senate produced a 40 percent turnout. After

Larry Baker, president 01 the 
- Senate from 1954 to 1966, 
predicted the death of the AS 

graduate and medicalltudents, 
and representatives from each 
of the various campus ethnic 

anizationa. ~ SUC, said Mc FJroy , 
would be an advilOry body to 
the administration, and its 
recommendationl would be 
"duly conlidered" in the 
administrative decilion·making 
procell. 

With the inception of the very

The 'Student Cooperative 
Union, TUSC's chosen 
SUCCeilOr, was unlike anything 
UCSD, or, for that matter, 
almost any university has ever 
leen. 

TUSC had decided to 
radically alter the traditional 
Prelident! Vice President! 
CounciV Ipring elections form 
or government. 

The Coop, as it was usually 
called, would never have any 

eerve al a representative to the 
budget committee, designed to 
disperse fWKia to the various 
student organizations. Joining 
these four Itudents were three 
lludents selected from the Coop 
regardesl of college affiliation . 

~jor budget decisions, as 
wdl as all decisionl of major 
consequence, were to be made 
by the whole Coop. 

As described by the Coop 
planning group, the Student 
Cooperative Union was 
designed to combine "a touch of 
anarchy , participatory 
democracy, meritocracy and 
socialism into one amorphous 
group. It is organized loosely, 
but only a loose organziation 
can allow itself to improvise with 
changing moods and adapt to 
new concerns." 

Stephanie Harris, SLiC 
member and TUSC chair. 
woman, resigned jUit before the 
Coop took office, siting a need 
to complete graduation 
requirements . JUit prior to the 
inception of the Coop in June, 
1974, she ruminated on the 
potential of the Coop in a 
Triton TImes interview.

"Students here aren't into 
ejecting people and establishing 
a heirarchy," Harris said, but 
she was concerned about the 
open nature of the Coop system. 
"Someone could bring in an 
interest group and jUit wipe out 
everything ... The Coop is only 
going to work if, there is a lot of 
publicity ." 

Harris' predictions were to 
prove prophetic. ~n the

would function as check. on 
eacl) other, each group striking 
down any group which 
threatened to become too 
powerful in the Coop. 

After preliminary meetings 
over the summer, the Coop held 
its first formal meeting in 
September of 1974, approving 
a list of TUSC appointed 
candidates to various campus 
committees. 

Meetings quickly became 
acromonious , primarily over 
bud'getary matters. The 
Budgetary Resource Group 
(BRG), which delegated funds 
to student organizations, was 
the scene of most of the power 
struggles. 

Radicals within the Coop, led 
by LiMandri and Montgomery 
Reed, wanted mandated 
minority and women ' s 
representation on the BRG. 
After much wrangling, the 
Coop threw up its hands an<:! 
eliminated the BRG. Later, the 
BRG was reconstituted (without 
quotas, but with direct ejection 
of college representatives by the 
student body), then expanded 
(to nine members, four from the 
colleges and five, including the 
chairman, from the Coop). All 
.of this maneuvering came 
within a two·month period. 

Some members of the Coop 
complained that Reed and 
LiMandri had manipulated the 
loosely applied rules, taking 
advantage of the lack of explicit 
discipline. maintaining devices 
in the Coop constitution, and 
also of trying to pack the Coop 
with sympathizers. 

The Coop survived the BRC 
controversy, and immediateJy

vote on their appointment 
almost all of whom allegedly left

Controversies of this sorl 
dogged the Coop. In addition to 
inlerest group domination and 
administration opposition. the 
C~p was accused of being 
radically unrepresentative of the 
student population as a whole 
by virtue of what critics claimed 
was a far left orientation. 

Others, such as Jeff Liefer 
later to be the first ASUCSD

Coop was irresponsible. that it

"Anything that takes over 90 
days to process is picked up in

Questions Stall Incinerator Plan 
Continued from page 4 lIally, lit! saJ(J. 

Another problem <.:oncerned 
the amount 01 gas burned per 
hour when the incinerator is in 
operation, said Micone. The 
study said that natural gas 
would be consumed at a rate 01 
1,600 cubic leet per hour on the 
average of 15 hours a week.

the options 01 building a smaller

"It wasn't until we 
'environmentalists' lound out 
two months alter (the initial 
study was prepared) that these 
things were questioned," said 
La!-ta . 

Responding to environmen· 
talist ' s questions concerning the 
project's energy consumption, 
Charles Micone, Irom the 
campus Environmental and 
Health Salety Ollice, 
commented that an incinerator 
"would not use as much energy 
as it takes to ship the wastes to 
Las Vegas. " 

Incineration is saler than 
other means of disposal, 
according to Micone. "When 
you ship the wastes to Nevada 
on a truck , the risk of something 
going wrong is greater than if 
the wastes are taken to an 
incinerator to be deactivated ," 
he said. 

China Visit Begins Exchange 

However, La~a ques tioned 
the lafety of "allowing 
radioilctive and 'potyvlnyl 
chloride emissions across the 
street from condom inium 

pi " com exes. 
The project faced a "major 

holdup" when the local Air 
Pollution Control District told 
the univerlity that the standard 
emiaaion control equipment 
would be required for the 
incinerator, explained Micone. 
ThUl, the initial eltimated

according to McElroy. 

Although the Chinese hosts 
financ' -c\ the delegation's stay, 
more than $20,000 was needed 
from the chancellor's 
opportunity lund to cover the 
academic delegates' traveling 
expenses to and from China, 
gifts and other extra costs, 
according to Herbenar. 

Included in.the..lill of $4,242

Med Dean to Run Military Health Affairs 
By Caitlin Horowitz 

Dr. John H. Moxley III Ie It for the Pentagon 
Sept. 9 on a one·year leave 01 absence to become 
assistant secretary 01 defense for health affairs. 

Presently dean of the School of Medicine and 
vice·chancellor for health services, he will report 
directly to Defense Secretary' Harold Brown, 
Moxley's secretary Margaret Jackson said. 

Temporarily replacing Moxley will be Acting 
Dean Marvin Dunne and Acting Vice 
Chancellor Dr. Elliott Lasser, a spokeswoman 
for the Chancellor's office said last week. 

"He's going to be in charge of a $4.5 billion 
budget governing all of the health care programs 
for the Armed Services. That includes 180 
military hospitals both here and abroad - it's 
quite a complicated position," Dunne said. 

Moxley will be responsible for a military 
medical school which provides education in 
return for military service, much like ROTC. He 
also w~1 be coordinating many drug and alcohol 
abuse prograrN within the uniformed services for 
both active and inactive members. 

Before leaving, Moxley confirmed that he 
expects to return in one year. He said he plans to 
rent a home in Alexandria, Va. and sublet his La 
Jolla residence while in Washington. 

When Moxley first carne to UCSD in 1973, he 
found, according to his former subordinate 
Dunne, a "leu than medical nrnar,.rn 

"The state had decided it could not· afford to 
build the kind of teaching facility we needed to 
train medical students," said Dunne. "University 
Hospital was to be no more than any other 
hospital; there were no lecture halls, there was no 
teaching equipment, it (the hospital) wasn't even 
on campus." 

According to Dunne, the presnt statuI of the 
medical center - with ita , auditoriums and 
dinicalteaching facilities - is largely a product 
of Moxley's persiltence. 

"He had to make a trade-off. Even though he 
knew the expanlion of the school might not be 
wdl received by the "acuity, he campaigned for 
increasing enrollment and ended up with 
government funding," said Dunne. 

"Another thing to Moxley's credit has got to 
be the Cancer Center (a c1inic·like facility for the 
treatment of cancer patients, including library 
and research facilities). From private 
contributions, he almost .inglehandedly raised 
$2.4 million," Dunne said. 

It was Moxley's superior ability as an 
administrator, laid Dunne, that interested 
Walhington. 

"He (Moxley) has always been good with 
government," including here, said Jackson, who .

Sturgeon to bring anything

Science Fiction 
Writer Speaks 

Continued rrem pa,e 38 
concept of the expanded 
family. 

"I find that I can't bring it 
up first, because if I do, 111 
never get away from it," he 
rem'arked. "People are 
expressing extraordinary 

, interest in a phenomenon 
that's already occurring 
throughout the country. " 

As a result, he warms the' 
auclence's curiosity up with 
other topics, such as The 
Strange HUman Proclivity to 
Stop, which is concerned 
with Man' s necessity for 
constant mobility. 

"Everything is in motion 
and people refuse to believe 
thi.," stated Sturgeon. "They 
want to build perma,nence, 
security, and stability. Thi. 
simply cannot be done. Man 
mu.t strive towards a 
dynamic instead of a static 
existence." 

Teaching courses in writing 
at . the college level is another 
.ide occupation. Howev~r, 
they usually last no more 
than a random semester. 

"I become too busy to do 
my. own work," he cited as a 
reason. 

On the subject of science 
fiction, Sturgeon said he 
considers the term itself as , 
"a misnomer." To him, ' 
"speculative fiction" or 
"constructive fantasy" are 
better word choices. 

Despite - "Sturgeon's Law" 
(" 90 percent of science 
fiction is crud, but then, 90 
percent of everything is 
crud" ) his' outlook on its 
progress through the years is 
optimistic. 

"Science fiction has been a 
~terary ghetto for the past 
forty years and is now 
emerging ," he replied. '''Aside 
from poetry. there is , no 
moore free' method of 
expression. It has no 
parameter • . " 

Sturgeon reacts with 
particular adnuration to the 
increase in women science-
fiction . writers, whom he 
regards as ~'darnn good." 

He allO thinks highly of 
the questions that fellow 
science fiction writer Isaac 
Aaimov tries to answer with 
his stories: "What if," "If 
only," and "If this goes on'=: 

Even without a name tag 
and speaker's ribbon, there is 
a reliable way to recognize 
him at first meeting. A 
medaHion, shaped like a Q 
pierced by an arrow, dangles 
around his neck. His dictum, 
"Ask the next question," 
provided the inspiration for 
the insignia. 

"This is the symbol of 
everything that Man has ever 
done ," he said . " It's 
important to continue to ask 
the next question, because 
when you stop, you die. It's 
the ultimate act of suicide."

cuts down her singing, saying 
that she struggles to keep up 
with the jazz tempos on the 
album, which, according to him, 
leave her "huffing and · 
quavering behind the jumpy 
beat." He then proceeds to 
quote the IimpJeat lyrics on the

context in order that he may 
deride their meaning. . 

atmospheric compositions. This 
is most noticeable on "The Dry 
Cleaner from Des Moines" -a 

"God," she e'mb~llishes her tuning and bending of her 
voice with some tasty and strings to describe the subject of Mingus was originally a 

coUaboration between lyricist 
Joni Mitchell and composer 
Charles Mingus, but Mingus 
died before the album's 
completion, thereby tuming it 
into Mitchell's memorial to 
Mingus as well 81 a 
colaboralion. 

Mingus is considered by 
many to ~ one of the greatest 
jazz composer. of our time. He 
played with jazz lliants like 
leiter YoWlS and great session 
men like Roland, ~k and 
Booker Ervin. Hia muiic could 
be called avant·garde big band 
jazz (though the term hardly 
describes the com~xity and 
variety of much of hi. music), 
and his album. Passions of a 
Man and Nostalgia In Times 
Square are classics. 

Over her last three albums, 
Joni Mitchell has been trying to 
make a successful tran.ition 
from popular music to jazz. 
Whether or not she hal been 
successful is a matter of debate 
amonl{ lOme critics. Critic Ariel 
Swartley in a recent Rolling 
Stone was harsh in his review of 
this album, calling her a "babe 
in bopperland" and belittling her 
knowledge of jazz music 
compared to Mingus'. He felt 
that she bit off more than she 
could chew, and that she had no 
business mingling with Mingus. 
But this kind of flack is only 
typical of critics who consider 
themselves to be jazz experts. 
They tend to fancy themselves 
as "purists", and dare not stoop 
to such "lower forms" of music 

He fails 10 take a few thing. 
into account, however. In the 
first place, it ia very hard to write 
lyrics to jazz composition. - in 
fact, there are 10 few jazz 
recording artists today who use 
lyrics that you can probably 
count them on one hand and 
one foot. And in that re.peel, if 
you want to count the number of 
Mitchell tunes which contain 
great lyrics (e.g., "Song for 
Sharon," "Free Man in Pari.," 
"Amelia," etc.), you will need to 
borrow the appendages of a few 
of your friend., as well as your 
own. 

In the second place, the 
Mingus collaboration was 
Charles Mingus' idea. He 
contacted her. He liked her 
stuff. 

Finally, Swartley failed to 
understand that the main fault 
with Mitchell's voice on this 
album ia not that she struggles 
to keep up with jazz, but rather 
that she just doesn't have the 
meat required to fiD in 'some of 
the gaps left in Mingus' 

, big band blues tune which for 
the most part relies on her voice ' 
to carry it through. The song 
has excellent lyric. and a nice 
hom arrangement by Jaco 
Pastorius, but generally faUs flat 
because MitcheU sort of cruises 
through it at too cool a pace. 
The sons would have been a 
success had Ihe belted out a few 
of the lines, perhapl sinai", • 
little more from her throat rather 
than the roof of her ~. 

On the other hand, "Sweet 
Sucker Dance," the first cut on 
the second aide, is a good 
example of what she can do with 
a jazz composition. Here, her 
voice weaves in and out of the 
.top 'n go rhythms of Pastorius' 
ball lines in a most appreciable 
manner. Aaon Hejira and some 
track. from Don Juan', 
Reckless Daughter, Mitchell 
and Pastorius work quite well 
together. The other musicians 
on the album are the members 
of Weather Report, with the 
exception of Joe Zawinul, who 
is replaced by Herbie Hancock. 
Their performance is adequate, 
even nice at time., but one will 
notice right off that there is no 
flashy riffing on this album, 
even though six noted ja_ whiz 
kids appear. 

Mitchell's guitar style on this 
album is unique, although it 
appears on only the two lOngS in 
which she wrote both the music 
and the lyric., "God Must Be A 
Boogie Man" and "The WOlf 
That Lives in lindleY. " In

ScrippS acientista have discovered an

Baja Califorrua, including a new colony 
of undersea animal., an ocean floor 
spoul of water with_ temperatures of up to 
400 degrees Cdsl~ (752 Fahrenheit) 
and a network of fissures and cracks in 
subterranean rocks, 

The .cientist., working with -
researchers from Woods Hole 
Oceanographic Institute in 
Massachuselta, explored 9 000 feet 
below the ocean's surface alter noting 
unusual thermal activity off the Baja 
coast. 

Similar activily had been noted in the 
Galapago~ IsI~ region, where two of 
the ~th s continental plates were 
spreading apart, allowing molten rock to 
be forced through a widening crack in 
the earth. 

Afler finding extraordinary life form.

UCSD Pair See Pioneer Results 
Physicists Get Answers From Saturn 

Magnetosphere 
Research Aided 

B Eric HupeU ~mat EdiIDr 
AI Pioneer 11 made ill closest 

approach to the planet Saturn earlier thil 
month, two UCSO phYlicilts at NASA'I 
AMES Research Center in Palo Alto 
poured' over the incoming data they had 
been awaiting for nearly a decade. 

Dr. Carl McFJwain and Dr. Walker 
F'lIius, together with thousands of 
NASA scientists, were on hand to 
analyze Pioneer'. Signall IerIt from near 
the planet Saturn, 960 million milea 

. away. . . 
Of primary interest to the two 

physicilts was data from their "trapped 
radiation detector," a 3.9,pound 
package built at UCSD and carried 
aboard the Ipace probe. "The 
instrument detects high energy particles 
trapped in the magnetosphere of the 
""t," saYI .-IIiUl. 

Data on the maanetoaphere, a 
. mqnetic field surrounding Saturn 
I which prevents pt amounts of 

. radiation from reaching the planet'l 
surface, wiD be carefully scrutinized by 
UCSD _Weberl aslhey try to.answer 
queetions about the origin of the 

m~~~ and of the radiation 
trapped there. 

4We weren't even sure Saturn had a 
mqnetic field previous to Pioneer," 
FIaaa saYI. _ 

A surface radiation level comparable 
to that of Earth's wu one ollhe ~se 
'indin,1 0' the misaion. OIThe 
magnetc»phere, and especially the 
ringl, lerVe to block radiation from 

.pace. The ring.," iays F'tlliUl, referring 
to the briliant bands of dUit and other 
particles encircling the planet," either 
trap the radiation completely, or else 
deOect and slow down the high energy 
particles 10 that they are absorbed 
before Ihe~ can enter Saturn's 
abnOlphere. "The radiation level Pioneer 
encountered on Saturn was the lowest 
since it left the lab on Earth." 

Another discovery of interest to 
astronomers was Pioneer's detection of 
a previously unknown moon orbiting 
. c1ose to the cloud tops of Saturn. 
Temporarily named 1979 5.1, the 
orbiting object was not clearly 
photographed by Pioneer, but its 
shadow was detected by the probe. 
Some scientists, however, are skeptical 
as to the existence of a "new moon." 

"The object Pioneer found could be 
Janus (a lIJlall, close orbiting moon of 
Saturn), or else it could be an alias of 
Janua - one of several amall moons 
mistakenly thought to be the same 
obiec:t,,, said .-dliUl. . 

F'.IIiUl was "doubtful" as to the 
poaaibility of life on either Saturn, or its 
large moon, Titan. "The temperature on 
Saturn it about 90 or 100 degrees 
Kelvin (minua 183 or 173 degrees 
centigrade), and Titan, the "habitable" 
outpost portrayed in several science 
fiction works, and object of lcientific

Heyer~~~l: Sewag~ 
-Threalens-OCeanS 

By Libby Bauett 
Thor Heyerdahl, the famed scientist 

and explorer who has sailed the world's 
ocean~ in balsa rafts and papyrus boats, 
be~eves that modem man's perception 
of the sea is often as primitive as the reed 
ship. 

"We think we are still on a flat earth," 
he says. "We act as if we can generate 
millions of tons of industrial and human 
waste, and then just sweep it away, 
dump it in the sewers and forget about it. 
If we place our pipes and sewers far 
enough away from the beaches, we feel 
that we can send everything off the edge 
of the planet." 

Heyerdahl, who has sailed many 
times to the horizon and beyond, knows 
there is no edge. The garbage that man 
dumps in the ocean stays in the ocean. 

Another strange notion we entertain, 
he says, is the belief that the oceans are 
endle.. and somehow different from 
other bodies of water, like lakes and 
rivers. No so, he says. "It just so 
happens that this planet is round, and 
you can sail in any direction and you'll 
hit land. The ocean is aland-locked Iake_ 
It is no saltier than some smaller lakes, 
no deeper, on the average, than many 
Asian lakes. It is simply larger." 

be no life here." 
Heyerdahl, who first brought 

attention to the pollution of the oceans 
with the expeditions of the Ra I and Ra II 
in 1969 and 1970, now believes that the 
ocean-going tankers which dump oil and 
sludge at sea are not the principle causes 
of ocean pollution . 

"The reaJ risk is not so much what the 
ships dump in," he says. "There are very 
few ships compared with cities in the 
world. We forget that all the sewers from 
all the cities go either directly into the 
ocean, or into a river and from there to 
t~ ocean. Very little is done to stop that 
kind of pollution." If something. is not 
done now, he says, life on the planet may 
end in the oceans, just as it began there. 

Heyerdahl, now 64, has studied the 
oceans for 40 years and knows them 
nearly as intimately as the fish that 

. inhabit them. When he first began 
studying the ocean currents on the 
Polynesian island of Fatu Hiva in 1937, 
he and his wife "spent one year on the 
beaches and in canoes and didn't see a 
single drift object that could be attributed 
to human activity."

Diabetes Test Found 
A new and highly successful test for 

detecting diabetes has been developed 
by researchers at the School of 
Medicine. 

The test combine. photography and 
computerized analysis. 

Conventional methods of 
diagnosing diabetes such as glucose 
tolerance tests and blood sugar levels 
have been criticized by many 
physicians as being unreliable. 

Developed under the direction of 
Benjamin W. Zweifach, UCSD 
professor of bioengineering, the new 
test focuses upon changes in the small 
blood vessels in the conjunctiva, or 
while of the eye. 

Changes in blood vessels are unique 
barometers of the progress of diabetea. 
In fact, most diabetics die of vascular 
disP.ases such as stroke, heart attack or

hypertension. . 
Computer techniquea developed by 

UCSO's Visibility Laboratory in 
Pasadena were Uled to scan eye 
photographs of 120 lubjects, 57 of 
whom were known to be diabetic and 
63 non-diabetic. 

The computer analYlis of the 
condition of blood vessels in the eye 
was 80 percent succellful in 
identifying diabetic patients and 68 
percent successful with the non. 
diabetics. 

At present, UC San Diego is the only 
center capable of performing the 
computer analysis, although Zweifach 
is confident that the service will 
eventually be available through 
computer centers throughout the 
country. 

As the IOlar wind nears Earth, high 
energy particles, IUch al gamma rays, 
are intercepted by the magnetOlphere 
and mUit circwnvent it, rather than 
passing through to the planet'l surface. 
A similar condition exists on Saturn, 
said F'dliUI, "accounting for the low level 
of auface radiation." 

The Pioneer probe will be succeeded 
by two Voyager probes. The first will 
reach Saturn in November 01 1980, 

~asling "very dOle" to Titan, said 
FiUiuI. Both Voyagerl will continue on 
past Saturn to the planet UranUl, well 
over a billion miles from Earth.

A s:: later, on the Ra II expedition,

SiAce that 1970 expedition an even

laYI. "On our laat voyage acroll ~

we sailed into a red belt - the color was 
exactly like the peel of an orange. It wal

for miles and miles like a red river in the

Heyerdahi believea that what he

fringe-the ocean, and those inland cities 
that dump both human and industrial 
waste into the rivers that flow to the-
ocean. This, much more than oil slickl, 
NYS Heyerdahl, poses the real risk to the 
oceans. 

"Most people don't realize it," he 
laments. "They say, 'Oh, the ocean has 
rec::eived pollution from rivers and so on 
for millions of years.' But that is not 
pollution. It's the wrong word. That is 
nourishment for the bacteria and the 
plankton that will be recycled. The 
problem is that in recent decades we 
have brought into existence 10 many 
new combinations of atoms that will not 
disintegrate, that will not recycle, that 
are perpetual. 

"It is impossible for anybody to be a 
prophet and say whether it will take 10 
years or 50 years before there is a 
disaster ," says Heyerdahl. "But yOu 
don't have to be a prophet to say that 
sooner or later even the ocean cannot 
ablOrb everything that we send into it." 

Heyerdahl contends that despite 
national IOvereignty over coastal 
waters, the time has past for narrow lelf-
interest in the sea. 

"There is no 'our waters'," he laYS. 
"The water is moving. The water 
belongs to the whole human familY. 

What is African water one week is 
American water some weeks laler. 
What is American water is then quickly 
converted into Asian water. The ocean 
is there one day and another place 
another day. 

"So I thi nk tha t this is reall y 
something that in the long run could 
unite all intelligent nations in a common 
effort to do IOmething that can give 
future generations a hope of surviving. 

"It's a matter of life and death for th-is 
planet," Heyerdahl says. "We cannot 
get away from the fact that in the 
beginning the only way for long-
breeding species to survive on this planet 
was that plankton in the ocean helped 
produce oxygen that created the first 
atmosphere. If we take away the 
plankton in the oceans, we take away 
the basis for life." 

Late last month in Geneva experts 
from 14 of the 18 Mediterranean 
governments reached agreement on the 
language of a new treaty to control land-
based pollution, factory . waste, 
municipal sewage, agricultural 
pesticides and fertilizer - in the 
Mediterranean. The treaty - expected 
to be signed next spring in Athens -
represenli the first such regional accord 
to lave the ieas in mankind's history.

By Jon Goetz 
Spor .. Editor 

The Athletic Department 
boasts that UCSD fields more 
intercollegiate teams than any 
other college in the U.S. 

Some of the 30-plus teams 
here play in some very non-
traditional competition sports, 
including waterskiing, 
racquetball, surfing and sailing. 

So it had to happen lOoner or 
later. 

UCSD and San Diego State 
formed the first horse race 
handicapping teams in the 
nation and matched up against 
each other in a special Del Mar 
race track promotion. 

The track billed Sept. 8 as 
"CoUege Day" and set up a 
handicapping contest between 
the two schools. Each four· 
person team started with al1 
imaginary $500 bCUlkroU, and 
could bet up to $50 on any 
combination of horses in the first 
seven races. The eighth race 
had no monetary ceiling on 
wagers. To avoid fluke 
bonanza., no exactaa or daily 
double bets were allowed. 

Neither team seemed an 
obvious favorite going into the 
contest. Each school had its 
expert. Bob Mulick, who 
researched bets for a gambler 
this summer, brought his 
experience to the Triton team. 
State coach Jim Buckalew used 
to teach a handicapping course 
at his school, and hal lOme 
experience around the track 
a11O. 

Because of lOme early bad 
bets, UCSD found itself playing 
catchup virtually the entire 
aftemoon. The Tritons fell 

. behind earlier when ita hofle 
In the first race took second in a 

close photo finish, and fell 
further behind when State won 
$70 on a bet in the fourth while 
UCSD lost ita entire wAfer. 
The Tritons ended up with 
$282 to State's $697. 

Still, when the eighth and 
final race came up, both teams

were still fighting for the win. 

In the UCSD viewing box, 
debate arose on how to 
overcome a $130 deficit. The 
consensus was that State would 
put a safe bet on Shamgo, the 
even-odcb favorite. 1he team 
figured only a winning bet on a 

Ioftglhot could win the contest. 
Mulick took ch8rge- of the 

discussion, as he had through 
much of the afternoon'. 
between-race deliberations. 
"Shamgo looks too good to be 
true," he said. Better to wager 
on two of the other horses listed 

at hil{her odds. So with over 
$300 remaining in it. 
bankroll, the-team -put $200 on 
I'D Stand Pat (5-1) to win, and 
$100 on Senorita's Policy (4-1) 
to place. 

In the San Diego State booth, 
the team members were 
concerned about Ioaing their 
lead. "Yeah, we were worried," 
said one after the race. They 
decided to risk $250 of their 
nearly $500 reserve on the 
heavy-favorite. 

"It really became a 
psychological thing," aaid a 
State handicapper. "We 
thought if we lost that race, that 
was it for us." 

When the race be~n, I'D 
Stand Pat challenged 0 
for the lead, but faded after 
dubhoule turn. But Senorita's 
Policy came from back in the 
pack to challenge Shamgo,

finish. San Diego State won the 
$1000 scholarship first prize for 
hitting the race exactly right. 
Had Senorita's Policy run first, 
UCSD would have won the 
prize. Instead, it took home a 
$250 check for second place. 

Look for thil contest to 
become an aMual fixture at Del 
Mar. Puclicity Director Dan 
Smith, the originator of the 
match up, hopes to expand it 
into a North-South contest by 
inviting teams from UCLA and 
USC during the ]980 racing 
leason. . 

Both San Diego teams 
indicated that they will return 
next year, if invited. "It was a lot 
of fun when you don't have to 
lose your own money," said 
Hipp. The UCSD coach made 
out well in his own right, 
however, picking up $50 on a 
$5 exacta.

will begin with a ,study of Locke's theory of the state 
and Marx's critique of it. We will then investigate 
three contemporary philosophies of the just state: the 

libertar~an theory of Nozick, the liberal welfare-state 
theory of Rayvls, and the radlcaf sociaHst theory of 
Macpherson. ' 

Pbfioeop1ly lee - 'l'h8 ~ of 
8oo1al Bokmoe (KW1P 12-12:60) 

This course will deal with a set of interrelated 
problems that confront all who seek to understand 
social behavior: Is It possible to gain a "scientific" 
explanation of human action and institutional life? 
Can the members of one society achieve a truly , 
unbiased" objective understanding of some past 
society, an alien culture, or some future possible 
society? Are the theories developed in social 
science politically "neutral," or do they necessarily 
express certain practical interests and ideological 
positions within a SOCiety? When theories in social. 
science sharply disagree, are there universally valid 
methods, concepts, or standards available to resolve 
such conflicts? What are they? 

We will study the theories of Hempel, Kuhn, Marx, 
Skinner, Winch, Gellner, Macintyre, Taylor, etc. to 
gain a perspective on these issues. 

Both oourses wm be taught by 
Prof~r Gera.ld D. Doppelt.

'Anisotrop-ic Shielders' Flourish 

Administrator Also Runs Football Team 
By Jon Goetz 

Sports Editor 
Chemistry department 

adminiltrator Dr. Paul Croft's 
office looks like any other 
adminiltrator'. office. ·A 
computer terminal sits behind 
his desk. Rows of noteboo~1 
and chemistry texts .tand on 
wall shelves. 

Yet on hi. m-awing board, 
where one might expect 
chemical equationl or 
management strategies, ~re 
are flag football plays and 
game tactics. For besidel 
being number two administra· 
tor in the massive chemistry 
department, Croft doubles al 
player/coach. of the two-time 
coed champion Anisotropic 
Shieldera. 

If you're wondering what 
anisotropic shields are, . they 
have something to do with 
the configuration of electrons 
around the nudeus. ('It's a 
very esoteric term," said 
Croft. 

This bearded ex.professor 
invents the plays, calls the 
plays, and shares quarter· 
backing duties for the team. 
Yet he is reluctant to talk 
about his role with the 
Shielderl. "My contribution is 
just the organization and the 
beer (for after the games)," 
he plainly admits. 

True, the team does have 
some of the bee t talent in the 
school, mo.tly drawn from 
chemi.try graduate students. 
Diminutive Arlene Garst, 
among the top wome,n 
softball player. at UCSD, 

We carry posters, 
rugs, and 

paraphernalia ... 
gifts from 

around the world 

plays right end for the 
Shielders. Intercollegiate 
rugby Player Connie Parker 
brings her experie,nce in that 
football-like sport to the 
team. And quarterback Carol 
Post is acknowledged as one 
of the finest women at her 
position at the school. 

Several other male grads, 
including Jeff Bolin, start for 
the team a111O. The women, 
however, are the key to the 
Shielders' success in its 
first three seasons together, 
according to Croft. 

He has adapted his game 
strategy to the rules, and has 
come out on top in coed 
competition. "The rules are 
really thought out to 
neutralize the sex differences 
and to just have fun . 
Women are the strong point 
in the game," explained 
Croft. 

To utilize his women, and 
his men, most effectively, the 
player/ coach devised a 
system to minimize confusion 
and maximize participation. 
Croft carries eight to ten 
note cards in the huddle with 
him with all his basic plays 
diagrammed on them. 
Instead of telling the other 
players their assignments, 
which IIOmetimes jumbles up 
the play, he simply picks out 
a play card and lets the 
players read what their 
responsibilities are. The 
Shielders are probably the only 
coed team to use this simple 
idea in its game. 

Some cardl, no matter 

how basic the plays they 
contain, survive from year to 
year, while others get 
scrapped. Two plays still 
being usee!, in fact, are 
copies of plays Croft used as 
a grad student player at 
Berkeley in the early 1960's. 

Since brute force is pretty 
much eliminated by the 

. UCSD-tailored rules, decep-
tion is the key ingredient in 
many of hi. plays. 

Croft, the chemist, 

scientifically seekl for a way 
to neutralize his opponents 
through carefully-thouRht-out 
formulas. . 

And Croft, the administra-
tor, has nearly perfected the 
organization of the Shielder •• 
The no-hallie note cards, 
team practices, and lengthy 
strategy sessions between he 
and co-quarterback POlt 
make for a winning team. 

But just because his team 
finished its season in the 

coed finals the lut three 
years, winning the past two, 
doesn't mean t~ will 
continue to roll over 
opponents. 

At least not according to 
Croft. "We're not a 
dynasty," he .ay •. "We only 
won the final. by two poinII 
in the last two yean ... Better 
Handa Than Last Year (the 
team they qed both yean) 
might give you the argument 
that we were lucky 81 bell." 

Flag Teams Back for More ' 
Intramural teams tend to fade' 

in and f<lde out, change names 
and change players. Yet a few 
teams survive the passing of a 
year. Some of last year's best 
men's football squads return in 
the next few weeks for another 
shot at invitations to the Animal 
Bowl (AAA finals), Banana 
Bowl (AA finals) and Cadaver 
Bowl (A finals). A few of these 
teams and some of their 
probable starters are listed here: 

Chocolate City, armed with 
razzle-dazzle tailback Marlin 
"The Magician" Moore, loves 
to keep the ball on the ground. 
Moore was the top-rated 
running back in the 1978 AAA 
season. Quarterback Dexter 
McMichael, center William 
McDaniel, wide receiver Chris 
Washington and Moore led the 
team to the Animal Bowl Ialt 
year. when it fell to · Raw 
Meat in overtime, 27-26. 

Black Death will take,to the 
air again this year after a 5·2 . 

third piace finish in · 1978. 
Quarterback Anthony F'der, 
thought to be the best passer at 
UCSD, should connect often to 
wide receivers · John Cox and 
Ricky Robinson and tight end 
Kevin Douglas. Filer can rocket 
70·yard passes straight down 
the line. 

Rocky Mountain Qy.tera, 
an intramural tearn (or all 
seasons, hal a good shot at 
closing down the high sco"", 
offensive teams. Last year It 
set a new intramural record for 
winl, with ten victoriel in the 
AA division. Don Harris.1>ou5l

Vancouver in the Soccer Bowl. 
During the regular season the 

.econd.year San Diego team 
managed only a 15.15 record 
but were ikclared champions of 
the Western Division of the 
American Con erence over the 
California Surf on a difference in 

go~ scoring. The Surf had an 

production was not very high 
until the last few 'games of the 
season when they began 
winning by scores ~ke 5·2 and 
9·2. 

In the first round 01 the 
playoffs they swept the Surf with 
forward Hugo Sanchez scoring 

Although missing the 
championship game by one 
goal, the San . Diego .Sodlers 
surpassed al~expectation8 when 
they ended their season in 
September. The Sockers 10lt a 
"mini-game," ro, to Tampa 
Bay in the North American 
Soccer League semi·finals. 
Tampa Bay had won the 
regulation game 3-2 earlier in 
the evening to even the two 
teams' series at one win apiece, 
Forcing a 30-minute deciding 
match.

In the first game of the series, 
before 20,267 fans in San

edged the Rowdies, 2-1. Had 
the Sackers won the following 
game in Tampa Bay, they 
would have gone to face

A 'Rough Day, 
At The Cove 

The annual La Jolla Rough Water Swim was held earlier this 
month with more than 1,100 contestants competing. An estimated 
crowd of over 15,000 lined the area around the La Jolla Cove to 
watch the swimmer, vie on a one·miIe course. 

Jeff Holshevinkoff, a San Diego State student, was the overaU 
winner in the one-mile race. Kay Lundy, a y. Jolla . High 
sophomore, won the AAU sanctioned Three-Mile Open Water 
race for the national women', championship. 

In the photos, from right clockwise, women line up for their race 
as the men wait on stairway; hvo competitors stagger toward the 
finish line; swimmers head out in 3-mile race; men at start line for 
the one-mile race.
