SACRAMENTO - Despite 

Gov. Brown's belt· tightening 
predictions. the University of 
Califomia's proposed $972.4 ' 
million budget for 1980·81 
emerged from the Department of 
Finance in relatively good shape. 

In the budget Brown will 
propose to the legislature this 
morning, UC was aUoted $959.7 
million, a 5.9 percent increase' 
over this year's budget. 

The university originally 
requested a b~get representing a 
7.5 percent mcrease over the 
1979·80 budget. 

Neither the Regenta or Brown 
included talary adjustmenta in 
their proposals. 

This was particularly welcome 
news after the scare last 
November because when the 
Department of F'mance requested 
a list of Iow·priority programs 
equal to 10 percent of the amount 

....()f money UC receives from the 
state, or $90 miUion. 

Although he has not yet seen 
the Governor's budget, UC 
President David Saxon said 

yesterday the proposed spending 
plan "meeta some of our 
im~rtant spending needs." 

Saxon cited in particular the 
money allocated for instructional 
equipement, additional teaching 
assistanta and 100 percent state 
financing of the Student 
Affirmative Action Program. 

The biggest losers in Brown's 
budget were the $4 million 
faculty enrichment program, the 
$4.7 million reimbursement of 
post Prop.13 cuts and the 52.7 
million student financial aid 
programs. 

While the Governors budget 
providea for an addition of 92 
undergraduate teaching 
a.sistanta in the .,stem, the full 
amount requested by the 
university, no fWlding was set 
aside to restor the student/faculty 
ratio from the current 17.5 to I to 
the 1970 ratio of 16.5 to I. 

The Governor also proposes 
$2 million for the .tudent 
affirmative action program which 
is presently being financed by 
student fees. 

This means that in addition to 

a $200,000 increase in the 
program, that the state will 
underwrite it. 

The new graduate affinnatiw 
action program, however, was 
totally ipored. 

The Educational Opportunity 
project(EOP), which also uked 
the state for compleate fundint. 
did not receive a ~my of their 

~sted $2.7 million. 
The EOP cUrrendy is funded 

by education lees. 
Noticeably ab.ent from the 

governor's budpt wu the I

department. ' last year u a 
consequence of Proposition 1;1. 

But neither UC nor any odw, 
state agenc), received a 
restoration of the budaet control 
section .. cutt made since' 
pro-.J)OlItion 13. 

The restoration of these cuts 
was scratched in the eleventh

Iranian Students in 
INS Deportation Push 

S.urvey Shows Used Record Store 
Wanted in Student Center Vacancy 

By John Klock 
F 0, five Iranian studenta in the area who have been 

ordered to leave the country, and for any others who 
failed to register with the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service in December, the only hope of 
avoiding deportation is a legal challenge now being 
pursued in Washington. 

Last month a District Court judge in Washington 
declared that singling out Iranians for the spet:ial 
check of their status was illegal a~ granted an 
injunction against the campaign, but an Appeals 
Court lifted the injunction only days later and 
eventually overruled the lower court decision. 

Moves have been made to have the case heard by 
the fuD Appeals Court or by the Supreme Court. It is 
still poaible the judge's order might be reinstated, 
having the effect of suppressing any evidence 
gathered in the special registration of Iranian 
studenta.

The AS furthered ita plans last 
night to launch two new student· 
managed businesses on campus 
this quarter. 

Resulta of a survey questioning 
studenta on what they woulci like 
to see fill the space vacated by the 
Daily Cuardian in the Student 
Center were discusses and 
proposals for the type of food 
service intended for the partly. 
empty Coffee Hut were presented 
at last night's AS Council 
meeting. 

200 out of 1000 surveys sent 
to studenta were returned to 
Student Center Board Chairman 
of Co-ops and Enterprises Scott 

Kessler, who said last night that 
used records, sundry items, 
plants and "drugs," in that order, 
were the top choices for 
merchandise in the proposed. 
store. 10% of students who 
returned surveys indicated they 
would like to see other businesses 
fill the space. But the AS does 
"not have enough money to open 
a full·scale store," AS Vice 
President Nancy Laga said. 
Therefore, "r.ecords or planta 
seem to be the extent of what the 
AS can afford." 

Phil Low, who is working out 
the budget for the future store, 
countered that the AS would 
"need twice the amount of moner, 
we now have for a record .tore. ' 

Used records, however, are 
considerably cheaper to market, 
and the additional possibility of 
ac~iring "cut albums" through 
KSDT is being considered. 

Another Council member was 
not so· optimistic. He said he saw 
"three record stores in the Bay 
Area recently go out of 
b"liness." P/eaN 111m to page 4 

Scripps Professor,'Says. A--Test 'Safe' 
By Mania Gieben 

A sharp rise in San Diego 
area radiation level. 25 years 
ago was not caused by an 
undersea A·bomb test in 
which Scrippa Institute of 
Oceanography participated, 
but rather by an above Found 
test in Nevada, a Scripps 
scientist is saying in response 
to the claims of a local 
environmentalist. 

A few weeks ago. 
environmentalist Tony 
Hod ,e. approached San 
Dietro Mayor Pete Wilson 
with doc:umenIa claiminl that 
the IOUn:e of the excessive

contacted authorities on 
radioactive fallout and 
initiated a scientific evaluation 
of Hodge's fallout data. 

Scripps nuclear ~hysicist 
and oceanographer Dr. Ted 
Folsom, who wu a participant 
in the Wigwam tests, was one 
of those called in to evaluate 
the charges. 

The bomb was a bit larger 
than that exploded over 
Hiroshima, and equivalent to 
30 kilotons of TNT. 

Scripps, which was' invited 
to help designate the site for 
the test, chose one that was 
considered the Hdesert of the' 
ocean," far enough offshore to 
prevent harm to the mainland. 

He adds, "They didn't 
expect much of the radiation to 
come to the surface, and not 
much did." 

Accordins to Folsom, air 
samplinj devices in down· 
town San Diego supplied 
scientists with data that 
eventually aided them 
in calculating the half·

were able to estimate

enouth recorda ,to bow

After evaluating the 

radiation level present during 
the peak day in San Diego, 
scientists concluded that 
Wigwam was not the only test 
that could have been the cause 
of radiation in the San Diego 
area during tJ:tat day, Folsom 
said. 

Folsom explains that 
around the same time that the 
Wigwam bomb went off, some 
other test bombs of almost the 
same strength were tested in 
the ~n air on hiP towers at 
the Nevada Teat @te.

Soviets I~tend To 
Stay in Afghlanistan 

WASHINGTON - Soviet President Leonid l. Brezhnev 
told President Carter that RUilian troop. will not be withdrawn 
from ~ihaniatan until they "have completed their work," a 

. senior White House official Mid ,yesterday. 
The official, ukina not to be identified by name, said the 

Soviet leader'. response came when Carter complained oyer the 
"hotline" to Moscow about the Soviet m1itary movement into 
Afllhanistan. 

fie said the conversation took place on Dec. 29, two day. 
after a Soviet·backed coup took place in Afllhanistan.; 

"You can characterize that .tatement by Brezhnev as 'the 
Soviets will withdraw the troops when they have completed their 
work,' the official said. . . 

The White House official aIao indicated that brief 
c~.tiOn had been liven to military force to respond to the 
maNive Soviet military int.rvention . 
, But the official left the impression that aach a reIpOOIe was not 
liven extenaive review. .

During the meeting, the first of at least four IUch aesaions, 
Carter won what the White House official said was "bipartisan 
support for both a firm reI~mse to the Soviet invasion in the 
short term and support for the Iong·term .tepa that may be

Poor MlD'derer. 'The gr~t 
innovativene.. and broad 
imagination of the Czechoslo-
vakian playwright came to life

story entitled Mild by Leonid 
N. Andreev, the play i. set

to the unrequited love for his

Poor Murderer place. a 
heavy reliance on Shake-

of paralleli.m for Anton. Like 
hi. 380-year-old model, he is 
swept into a web of rebellious

tragedy. Kohout takes hi.

The acting in Poor 

Murderer is one of the play's 
many strengths. John David 
Castellanos undertakes the 
ambitious role of Anton with 
the same wholeheartedness 
and total commitment that the 
protagonist gives to his own 
parts, It marks an impressive 
Old Globe Theatre debut for 
the Grossmont College and 
San Diego State University 
aJumnus.· 

& 
Karl W. Hesser adds this 

playas a change of'pace from 
his repertoire of straight 
Shakespearean endea vors 
that include A Midsummer 
Night's Dream, As You Like 
II, Julius - Caesar, Macbelh, 
Othello, The Comedy of 
Errors, and T wellth Night. He 
brings out both the 
lighthearted and serious sides 
01 his character of A1exey in 
an _exquisite perfonnance. 

I John David Castellano, in ," playa an actor 
committed to a mental institution after playing Hamlet. 

Students at Kearny High 
know Jack R. Win8lll beat as 
the head 01 the school'. drama 
department. He continues in 
the great tradition of the 
theater from Jhe other aide of 

the stage via a stirring 
portrayal of the practical and 
logic-bounded Professor 
Drahembiuky. . 

Cornelia . Hancu Eulert 
lends continentaJ flair to the 
role of Tatyana Nilolayevna 
with her Romanian accent and 
dark beauty. Also an Old

equals in excellence. 

Consisting of N ic holas 
Genovese, Doug Hinkston, 
Robert ' Paneco, Deborah 
Mathews, and Betsy Smith, 
their abi~ties to shift from one
