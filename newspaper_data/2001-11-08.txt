UC faces likely funding cuts 
State agencies told to prepare for decreases 
By EVAN McLAUGHUN 
Staff Writer 

The University of California 
will likely face "financial chal-
lenges" when making upcoming 
budget appropriations for the 
2002-2003 fiscal year, according 
to a statement released by 
Chancellor Robert C. Dynes on 
Nov. I. 

Dynes' statement came just a 
week after Gov. G ray Davis issued 
executive orders requiring state 
agencies to freeze the hiring of 
employees and to prepare for bud-
get cuts of between $8 billion and 
$14 billion in the upcoming year. 

"Currently, all of the campuses 
are reviewing their budgets," said 
UC Office of the President 
spokesman Paul Schwartz. "They 
will see how they can best accom-
modate the governor 's request 

without undercutting the quality 
at the University of California." 

The Oct. 23 executive order 
does not directly require the 
University of California to freeze 
hiring because it is not an official 
state agency - the UC Board of 
Regents governs the UC system. 
However, both the California 
State University and California 
community college systems report 
directly to state legislature, so the 
policy directly applies to them. 

Still, UC President Richard C. 
Atkinson has requested that UC 
chancellors comply with the exec-
utive orders by using caution 
when engaging in upcoming 
financial commitments. Dynes 
indicated that he is heeding 
Atkinson 's advice. 

"[The UCs] have always coop-
erated with the state when it has 
faced a budget downturn, and we

certainly expect to do so again," 
Dynes stated. "It behooves us now 
to do whatever we can do to slow 
spending. I have asked each vice 
chancellor to begin developing ... 
tactics to generate savings and 
budget reductions." 

Margaret F. Pryatel , assistant 
vice chancellor of resource man-
agement at UCSD, said state offi-
cials saw that California was on 
the verge of an economic decline 
based on last year's drop in capital 
gains and stock options - income 
sources that have accounted for up 
to 25 percent of the annual rev-
enue of the state's general fund . 

This summer, Davis requested 
that all state agencies prepare sce-
narios that would account for bud-
get slashes of 3 percent, 5 percen t 
and 10 percent. In October, the

State orders audit 
of UC spending 
Probe investigates how the 
university used state fund 
By ED WU 
Senior Staff Writer 

The California Bureau of tate 
Audits began a six-month process 
last week to determine whether 
funding provided by the state legis-
lature last year has been used in 
accordance wi th restrictions placed 
on the money's use. 

T he audi t was requested by 
Assemblywoman Jenny Oropeza, 0 -
Long Beach, at a time when the state 
budget continues to tighten. The 
agreement to provide more fundi ng 
for the UC system remains in place 
through fiscal year 2002-2003 . 

"In spite o f the university's 
agreement to increase the quality 
of undergraduate education, one of 
its fastest-rising costs is academic 
administration, " Oropeza said. 
"We need to ensure that the uni-
versity's priorities are in the right 
place.- on edup ting students." 

Oropeza's request ta rgets the 
UC system in light of an annual 5 
percent increase in the university's 
budget contingent on the universi-
ty's commitment to use the money 
to improve undergraduate educa-
tion. T he money was supposed to 

fund measures !>uch as implemcnt-
ing a state-supported sumll1cr ,es-
sian program at the sallie per-tUl1I 
cost and quality as cour cs offered 
during the regular school year. 

IIowever, a report released hy 
legislative budget analysts for the 
sta te of California stated that 4 per-
cent of that 5 percent base increa>c 
was not designated for specific pur-
poses. According to the analysIS, 
the University of California indi-
cated that most of the funds would 
go to salary increase, while the 
remaining I percent would go 
specifica ll y to long- term necds 
such as bui lding maintenance and 
library materials. 

The audit looks to use data 
from UC accounting to compare 
current per student funding to that 
o f prio r years. Speci ficall y, the 
audi t will examine how much 
money per student goes toward 
administra ti on, resea rch and 
instruction, and whether the ratio 
of admi nistrative to instructional 
costs has been increasing despite 
the additiona l funding earmarked 
for undergraduate education.

Krispy Kreme arrives 
Espresso Roma sells the popular 
doughnuts at 75 cents each 
By KIRSTEN HUBBARD 
Contributing Writer 

Krispy Kreme doughnuts, made 
by the popular bakery chain, are 
now available at Espresso Roma in 
the Price Center. 

"Krispy Kremes are an orgasm 
in a doughnut," said Warren senior 
Fady Mikhael as he purchased his 
first doughnut of the school year 
from the cafe . "That's what I always 
say." 

It was this populari ty tha t 

inspired Gary Radcliffe, director of 
the University Centers, to invite 
Krispy Kreme to the Price Center. 

Krispy Kremes arrived on cam-
pus the morning of Monday, ov. 5 
when free doughnuts were distrib-
uted to faCility and staff. Now 12 
diffe rent kinds of doughnuts can be 
found in a white case nen to 
Espresso Roma's own food cases.

BRIEFLY 
UCSD scientist granted 2nd M.E.R.I. T. award 

UCSD School of Medicine researcher and pro-
fessor Jerrold Olefsky received his second Method 
to Extend Research in Time award from the 
National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive Kidney 
Diseases for his studies on insulin and the body's 
resistance to it as a leading cause of diabetes. 

The grant, which is rarely ~iven to the same 
researcher twice, is for $2.6 million and will be paid 
over five years. Olefsky's first M.E.R.IJ. award expired 
in 1997. 

M.E.R.l.T. awards are designed to pro'Vlde 
researchers with the opportunity for long-term, stable 
support to enhance their continued scientific creativ-
ity and decrease the administrative burdens that 
grant applications can entail. 

Olefskv's current work focuses on the insulin-sig-
naling pathway that leads to the stimulation of glu-
cose support In diabetic patients, the body does not 
produce enough insulin, which is crucial for glucose 
conversion and leading an active life. 

In addition to his work through UCSD, Olefsky is 
the scientific director of the Wlittier Institute for 
Diabetes in La Jolla. He helped develop insulin-sen-
sitizing drugs that are now standard for Type II dia-
betes, and he helped define the intracellular path-
ways for insulin and growth factor action. 

UCSD researchers find chemical 
that blocks build-up in cells 

UCSD School of Medicine researchers have 
found beta-synucleins that halt the excessive build-
up of Lewy bodies found in the dying cells of 
Parkinson's disease patients. 

Eliezer Masl iah, professor of neurosciences and 
pathology, led the investigation. According to 
Masliah, the naturally occurring b-synucleins inhib-
ited the Lewy body-producing activity of alpha-
sy'nuclein in mice. A-synuc\ein, a cousin of its pos-
Sible halting agent, has been linked to Parkinson's 
patients. 

The mechanism by which b-synudein works is 
still unknown. 

Other members of the UCSD research team ' 
included Makoto Hashimoto, Edward Rockenstein, 
Michael Mante and Margaret MallolY. 

The funding for the research was provided by 
grants from the National Institute of Health and 
the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's 
Research. 

UCSD summer session office 
requests suggestions for 2002 

Suggestions for more summer courses are being 
requested by the UCSD Summer Session Program 
before Dec. 3. 

The program hopes to expand the number and 
range of summer courses offered by forwarding 
the list of suggestions to the planning committee. 
According to results from the course evaluation 
catalog. the majority of students want more upper-
division classes, but the program also intends to 
offer as many general education classes as possi-
ble. . 

There are about 300 courses now scheduled for 
this summer. 

Input can be submitted bye-mail to 
summer@ucsd.edu. 

The summer session course catalog will be avail-
able in mid-April 2002. 

San Diego hospitals included 
in new blood research network 

San Diego patients will soon benefit -from 
improvements in the safety and effectiveness of 
bone-marrow and blood transplantation, thanks to 
the new Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical 
Research Network. 

Recent discoveries in blood and bone-marrow 
treatments include gene therapy, "mini-transplants" 
that don't completely abate the bone marrow, use of 
unrelated donors, and the use of stem cell technolo-
'1:{. 

The national BMT network was formed by the 
National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute and the 
National Cancer Institute. 

The new network is comprised of the 
UCSD/Sharp BMT Program, the Scripps Research 
Institute, the Scripps Health BMT Program and 13 
other clinical centers nationwide.

however, was the henna tattoo 
booth. 

At the lectures, many of the 
speakers were confronted with 
pointed questions regarding per-
ceived inconsistencies between the 
doctrine and behavior of Muslims, 
and on the conflict in Mghanistan. 

Mohammad Kotob, lecturer for 
"The Concept of Allah," often 
mentioned Islam's tolerance, 
respect and peacefulness toward 
other religions in his replies to 
q~estions ranging from the holiness 

of Allah to Islam's treattnent of 
Moses and Jesus Christ. 

Mohammad Nasser, president of 
the Muslim American Society in San 
Diego, responded during Monday 
night's "Jihad vs. Terrorism" lecture 
to questions about the Taliban's 
actions. He dismissed arguments

condemning the Mghan government 
for not turning ' over Osama bin

"I came in more peaceful than I

See, referring to Nasser's explanation

of the Wlderlying causes of conflict 
between Muslim nations and the 
Western world. "I'm so agitated I 
JUSt want to wear red, white and blue 
for the rest of the month." 

Most students seemed to be 
attentive to the speakers. 

"I came here to understand 
more about Islam," said senior John 
Quenzer. "As a Christian it is 
important to understand other reli-
gions. I have a better Wlderstanding 
of how Muslims view Allah." 

Alcil of the hip-hop group 
Jurassic 5 .performed several ra p 
songs at noon in the Price Center. 
After his performance he spoke 
about how being Muslim has posi-
tively affected his life. He also led a 
short prayer.

MSA concludes Islam Awareness 
Week with an open prayer session

be delivered freshly baked to the 
Price Center at 4:30 a.m. daily. 

According to Roma employees, 
the word was out even before the 
doughnuts arrived. Considering the 
well-known popularity of Krispy 
Kreme doughnuts, Espresso Roma 
employees said it was no surprise 
when they were bombarded with 
Krispy Kreme-related interroga-
tions throughout the past week. 

Monday morning, the lines at 
the cafe were twice as long as 
usual The first shipment of Krispy 
Kremes was nearly exhausted by 
the afternoon. 

Some students said they are 
happy with the development. 

"I've only recently been 
exposed to the Krispy Kremes 
delicacy," said Muir freshman 
Shaza Hanafy, biting into her 
glazed doughnut. "I've only tried 
one doughnut so far and I love it." 

Other students, however, do 
not share in Hanafy's enthusiasm 
for the pastries. 

"Students are already a . high-
stress group," said Muir senior Joey 
Campbell. "An institution they pay 

. so much money to attend should be 
looking out for their health. Price 
Center has the opportunity to sup-
port a variety of smaller businesses, 
providing a variety of healthier 
foods. The last thing we need is 
more big corporations that students 
have no choice but to suppon. " 

Rob Barnes, a Roosevelt junior, 
was more passionate about his dis-
taste. 

"We definitely don't need any-
more bloodsucking capitalist busi-
nesses in the 'Overprice' Center 
sucking up students' money," he 
said. 

Probe: 
Audit is expected to 
cost the state $200,000 
Continued from IMP 1 

UC Office of the President 
spokesman Paul Schwartz said 
that the audit itself would require 
a large expenditure of UC 
resources. 

"The audit, estimated to cost 
the state over $200,000 and con-
sume 3,000 hours, is requiring the 
time and attention of about a 
dozen senior staff at UCOP," 
SchW1lrtz said. "It will also require 
the involvement of a handful of 
senior staff at each campus. 
Naturally, there's a cost to the 
[University of California] associ-
ated with that kind of involve-
ment - exactly how much 
remains to be seen." 

Schwartz also said that the 
University of California already 
provides the state legislature with 
a variety of accoWltability and

governor again requested that the 
agencies hypothesize how a 15 
percent reduction in budget fund-
ing would affect them. Days later, 
he delivered the executive orders. 

The University of California 
received 21 percent of its revenue 
from state funding last year. 
Because it is such a significant rev-
enue source, there is speculation 
that a combination of program cuts 
and registration fee increases will 
be made. In the past, the state has 

reports on undergraduate educa-
tion we already submit and the 
fact that UC continues to meet 
its enrollment figures, this audit 
may represent some redundan-
cy," Schwanz said. 

Officials from the state audit 
office said that the audit is still in 
its infancy. 

"This is one of our larger 
audits," said Chief Deputy State 
Auditor Steve Hendrickson. 
"We've just started at the very 
beginning, and we're not even a 
week into it." 
. Hendrickson said that the 

estimated 2,990 hours of man-
power needed for the audit would 
take about six months to con-
clude. There is no specified 
requested completion date. 

The California State Auditor is 
a nonpartisan, independent agency 
within the executive branch of 
California's government. The 
Joint Auditing Committee, which 
includes members of the State 
Senate and the State Assembly, 
agreed in late September to grant 
Oropeza's request for an audit of 
the system. 

subsidized student fee hikes. 
Pryatel said UC Vice 

President of Budget Lawrence C. 
Hershman has had a discussion 
with the UC Regents about fund-
ing for the next fiscal year. 

"The strategy he has suggested 
is to cut the programs that are not 
part of our core mission," she said. 

The UC Board of Regents will 
meet Nov. 14 and Nov. 15 in San 
Francisco. The response to the 
budget si tua tion is one of the top-
ics on the agenda. 

UCOP is working with the 
State Departtnent of Finance to 
solve the budgeting problem. 
Eleven percent of the state's gen-

Sony, not Guardian, 
responsible for 
content in ads 

In the November-December issue of its 
newsletter, the UCSD Women's Center ran an 
article titled, "Controversy Over Sony Ads In 
The UCSD GUIlT'dian." This headline refers to 
the Sept. 24 issue of the Guardian, in which 
Sony Screen blast purchased four advertise-
ments. 

Three of the Sony advertisements 
described by the Women's Center were pho-
tographs of young women, and one por-
trayed a young man. Overlaid onto each ad's 
photograph was one of Sony's slogans: "Use 
me," "Share me," Enter me" and 
"Manipulate me." 

In the weeks following the circulation of 
these advertisements, the Guardian received 
letters to the editor that criticized these ads' 
sexual overtones and the Guardian's publica-
tion of such material. . 

The Women's Center newsletter notes this 
and states that it has scheduled a presentation 
and discussion in response to readers' reac-
tions. The forum is intended to address ques-
tions such as, "How do media images affect 
our view [sic] of women?" and "What is the 
line between advertising and pornography, 
between criticism of the media and censor-
ship?" 

These questions, and their relative answers, 
are interesting, thought-provoking and cer-
tainly deserving of scrutiny. However, the 
Gum'dian should not be held responsible for 
the content or the implied messages that 
advertisers choose to rely on when marketing 
their products. Advertisers throughout many 
generations have perpetually relied on selling 
sex in order to sell products, and criticism of 
Sony's advertisements is best directed not at 
the Guardian but at Sony, the creator of the 
images and slogans that some have found 
offensive. 

Admittedly, it is apparent that the Women's ' 
Center newsletter does not necessarily intend 
to hold the Guardian solely responsible for 
these ads' content. 

Still, concerns regarding the overt $exual-
ity of advertising should not have been 
prompted by these ads alone; any individual 
who regularly accesses the Internet, televi-
sion, magazines, billboards or major news-
papers is constantly exposed to sexuilly 
based advertising techniques. That such 
techniques happened to appear in the 
Guardian may have served as a wake-up call 
for groups concerned with these issues, but 
this instance is in no way a unique one and 
should hardly be the catalyst for an analysis 
of the power and nature of advertising. That 
power is expressed daily in much larger ways 
and on much grander scales - even on this 
campus. 

Furthennore, the Guordian believes that 
many of its readers, especially as students, pos-
sess a honed and powerful ability to critically 
analyze anything put before them. Although it 
may be argued that advertising can ,be power: 
ful enough, in some cases, to "contribute to 
violence against women," we presume that 
readers are capable of detecting the covert, 
money-driven purpose of advertisements such 
as those recently criticized, and that our audi-
ence can intelligently interpret such ads for 
what they are worth. , . 

It seems from some students' responses to 
Sony's advertisements, however, that we can 
only be hopeful that in making this assump-
tion, we have not engaged in a leap of faith.

A stable, secure Palestine 
holds the key to peace 

The United States and the United Nations must 
bear responsibility for finding a solution 

By MAnHEW LEPOII 
Contributing Writer 

The United States and the world 
should give attention to Palestine, not 
Afghanistan. 

This troubled and decimated region 
in the Middle East is the key to our 
conflicts with terrorism. The impor-
tance of finding Osama bin Laden 
pales in comparison to building a stable 
Palestinian region. 

The Israeli and Palestinian govern-
ments recently brokered a dear to 
remove Israeli troops from two impor-
tant towns in the region: Bethlehem 
and BeitJala. 

The Israelis inserted one clause into 
the agreement: Violence in the two 
cities must end. But when fighting 
broke out again a week ago the Israeli 
government decided to leave its troops 
and tanks in these cities as "peacekeep-
ers." 

What seemed like a promising 
beginning to 3 truce resulted in more 
gunfire and violence. 

The Palestinian and Israeli sides 
resorted to finger-pointing ·after the 
incident. 

An Israeli security source informed 
Reuters, "If Palestinians keep the calm 
and their commitments, Israel will re-
examine its decision." 

Chief Pale.stinian negotiator Saeb 
Erakat responded by stating, "Once 
again, we have had an agreement, and 
the Israeli side is violating it." 

Both sides have been playing this 
blame game for years . 

A never-ending circle of violence is 
the result. Retaliations occur, such as 
t,he Oct. 17 assassination of Israeli cab-
inet minister Rehavam Zeevi, which 
prompted Israel to send forces into 
Palestinian territories and attack posi-
tions there. 

This cycle should be familiar to any 
western viewer of the enduring con-
flict. 

The sides have signed peace settle-
ments over and over, such as the 

famous Wye River agreement of 
October 1998. 

It was intended to create a stable 
and calm Palestine, yet after months of 
delays in installing the agreement, 
Israeli officials withdrew from the plan. 
Violence resulted and has continued 
nearly unabated to this day. 

The deal, broke red by former U.S. 
president Bill Clinton, highlights the 
problem with the way the U.S. govern-

The recent terrorist 
attacks on the United 

; States have been a direct 
result of U.S. support for 

Israel and its violence 
toward Muslims. Some of 

the Israeli-enacted 
bloodshed has been 

justified, some has not. 
Either way, Arabs in the 

area see such acts of 
aggression toward 

Palestinians as sanctioned 
and supported by the 

United States. 

ment has handled its relations in the 
area. 

The reason for this plan's fail ure is 
lack of enforcement. 

The United States is not willing to 
send troops into the region as peace-
keepers or to enforce any agreement. 
This is an understandable but unfortu-
nate sentiment when one considers 
that peace in Palestine is vital to U.S. 
national security. 

The recent terrorist attacks on the 
United States have been a direct result 
of U.S. support for Israel and its vio-

lence toward Muslims. 
Some of the Israeli-enacted blood-

shed has been justified, some has not. 
Either way, Arabs in the area' see such 
acts of aggression toward Palestinians 
as sanctioned and supported by the 
United States. 

Bin Laden said, "Those who live in 
America will never taste security and 
safety unless we feel security and safety 
in our land and in Palestine." 

The terrorist activity in America 
and elsewh~re is a direct result of 
instability in the region. Palestine must 
be made secure. 

If the United States is not willing to 
step up to the plate' to enforce the secu-
rity in the region, who will? 

The United Nations can. An inter-
nationally backed accord is necessary 
for the region ' to realize hopes for 
peace. 

As cited repeatedly by the U.S. 
government, the reason our war 
against the Taliban will prove success-
fullies in the support the United States 
has received from the world. The same 
is true for Palestine. 

The United States needs to begin 
building a U.N.-sanctioned peace plan, 
including U.N . military enforcement 
for such a plan. 

The time is over for idle talk of 
"needing to restore talks" or "getting 
both sides back to the bargaining 
table." 

Both sides nee a to be brought 
before the United Nations to settle the 
problem. 

Only a world-backed plan will suc-
ceed where others have failed . 

Average Americans can help by 
writing to their congressmen and 
demonstrating support for the idea. 

Put your voice to work and convince 
the government of the necessity for 
action in Palestine. Americans must 
realize the importance of peace in the 
Middle East and how it directly affects 
national security. 

Then we can make such a realiza-
tion public - loudly.

Bombs are not an effective solution 
Military campaign is killing iIll)ocent Mghani civilians 
IyTAHAGAYA 
Contributing Writer 

There is no question' that the 
bombing campaign against 
Afghanistan is effective. 

It is effectively killing civilians, 
hampering humanitarian aid and 
recreating the desperate situation 
that provided the impetus for the 
rise of the Taliban. 

As citizens of the United States, 
we 'must recognize this, for in this 
great democratic na.tion of ours, we 
are given a voice and can be held 
accountable for our nation's 
actions. 

. Are we ready to take responsi-
bility for 3-year-old Rahmat Bibi, 
her legs broken and her head ban-
daged, crying aloud while asking to 
be taken to her dead mother, a vic-
tim of air strikes? 

Are we ready to take responsi-
bility for I-year-old Jan Bibi and 
her 3-year-old brother Gul Khan, 
lying in the same hospital bed, 
unaware, that they have been 
orphaned? 
_ I am not ready to take this 
reSpOnsibility. 

Bombing Afghanistan is killing 
innocent civilians and is taking us 
further from our stated objective of 
bringing down the Taliban. 

When the Taliban first rose to 
power in Afghanistan, the people 
welcomed it as a unifying force, a 
government that would bring a 
small mcasure of peace tO' a country 
ruled by tyrannical local despots 
and engulfed in civil war. The 
bombing campaign has once again' 
reduced Afghanistan to this base 
state. 

Who will the people look to to 
take them out of their misery? To 
America, whose bombs have fallen 

on hospitals, mosques and villages, 
or to the Taliban? 

Prior to the bombing, the 
Taliban was faced with mounting 
dissatisfaction with its application 
of religious law, but even this was 
better than a bombing campaign 
that disrupted humanitarian aid 
and rained death upon everyone. 

It is this bombing that has lent a 
new legitimacy to the Taliban, 
cementing its authority as the pro-
tector of the Afghan people. 
Afghans see trails of wounded civil-
ians left behind screaming jets jUJ[-
taposed against Taliban fighters 
malUling anti-aircraft guns. 

The people draw a simple con-
clusion: 'llris is a war not against 
Islam or the Taliban, but against 
themselves, the ordinary people of 
Afghanistan. 

"Why has America attacked 
us?," an elderly Afghan man asked. 
"We are civilians. We thought 
America was our friend. Please tell 
them to stop bombing us." 

While civilian casualties are an 
unavoidable byproduct of any air 
campaign - hence the military's 
anesthetic term "collateral damage" 
- there have been inexcusable 
instances of it, such as the bombing 
of Red Cross warehouses. 

On Oct. 26, U.S. Navy fighters 
and B-52 bombers mistakenly 
bombed six warehouses used by the 
International Committee of the 
Red Cross, destroying vital stocks 
of food. Not only is this the second 
time ICRC buildings have been hit 
since U.S. air strikes began on Oct. 
7, but two of the warehouses hit 
this time were struck the last time 
as well. And this was after the Red 
Cross met with American military 
officials and pinpointed locations to 
ensure that it wO,u1d not happen 

again. 
These are "smart" bombs. 

These are the pilots and planes 
and systems we ~pend billions of 
dollars on to ensure this sort of 
thing will not occur. What hap-
pened? 

Sept. 11 happened. The bomb-
ing campaign is the' reflex of a peo-
ple who have suffered though a 
great tragedy and are understand-
ably frightened and angry. 

But we must not let our anger 
occlude our judgment ahd pre-
clude justice. Bombing 
Afghanistan is not a solution but a 
worsening of the fundamental 
problem - and that is the gener-
ations of Afghans who have 
known nothing but war. . 

An Amnesty International 
report states, "War violates' every 
right of a child: the right t9 be with 
family and community, the right to 
health, the right to development of 
personality and the right to be nur-
tured and protected." We must give 
these children peace and their 
rights. 

The United States needs to halt 
its bombing calJlpaign, help to for-
mulate an acceptable multi-ethnic, 
broad-based Afghan government, 
resume humanitarian aid and seek a 
political solution to this problem. 

In the words of Taliban ambas-
sador Abdul Salaam Zaeef: "The 
way of solving a problem is negoti-
ation, understanding and dia-
logue." 

We must use this method 
because, as President George W. 
Bush said, "In our anger, we must 
never forget that we are a compas-
sionate people. While we firmJy 
and strongly oppose the Taliban 
regime, we are friends with the 
Afghan people."

Path to sainthood is 
replete with obstacles 
By DIVYA IUNCHAL 
Opinion Editor 

Everyone who knows me can 
attest to the fact that I am no 
Mother Teresa. In fact, some 
would argue that I am the biggest 
brat on the planet. Yet, recently, 
I've been struck by the "wave of 
kindness" that has swept the nation 
following the Sept. II attacks and 
been inspired to become a better 
human being. 

Some might argue this is sham-
less opportunitism at its best. They 
are correct. But I figure it's proba-
bly better to redeem myself now, 
just in case we're all obliterated by 
nuclear war in the future. 

Becoming a saint, though, is 
not as easy as I thought. In fact, it 
requires <ledication, discipline and 
an extremeley good heart (qualities 
I have very little of). I've tried to 
balance schoolwork with good 
works, but frankly, its quite diffi-
cult to meditate on global peace 
when I have a IO-page paper due 
the next day. 

I've even considered dropping 
out of school, "borrowing" thou-
sands of dollars from my parents 
and escaping to an impoverished 
country where I can feed thou-
sands of hungry people, personally 
install an irrigation system so 
everyone has acceess to clean 
water, and perform miracles in my 
free time. 

However, with the very real 
possibility of my parents hunting 
me down and subjecting me to var-
ious forms of torture, I've decided 
against it. So, although my goals 
are big, I've had to limit myself to 
smaller deeds of kindness that will 
put me in a better position for can-

onization by the pope. 
For one thing, I've resolved to 

never have "road rage" again. 
Now, if someone cuts me off, 
instead of flipping them off, I've 
simply mouthed, "that's not very 
nice" to the offending driver. I'm 
hoping that my example of "grace 
under pressure" will be used in the 
next DMV manual so that drivers 
everywhere can boost their kanna 
by a couple hWldred points. 

In addition, instead of reading 
the Nati01/ll/ ETUJui"(r front to back 
like I used to before Sept. II , I 
only read the horoscope section so 
that my mind is not tainted by the 
negative attitudes of some spoiled 
celebrities and the size 'of ).Lo's 
butt. After all, a saint has to have a 
pure mind if she wants to end 
poverty, violence and all the other 
vices this world offers. 

Furthermore, instead of calling 
my family and friends 10 times ;1 
day to air my worries about the fate 
of the world, my ample cellulite 
and a cavity on my left molar, I 
leave messages on their answering 
machines insread (thar way they 
can easily delete them). If thats not 
angelic, I don't know what is. 

I have to admit that becoming a 
better human being is a difficult 
task, especially if you're a UCSD 
student. It's easy to get sucked into 
the hellish world of academics and 
escape to the library when your ser-
vices could be better used feeding 
empty meters and tutoring slackers 
in the art of time management. 

Of course, all of you dear read-
ers (yes, you too, Ben Boychuk) 
can emulate my style if you wish to 
be a better human being. But don't 
expect to become a saint. Leave 
tha t task to me.

"War Makes It Worse." That's 

what one of the signs said behind the 
podium at the Pro-America rally on 
Oct. 23, which me GWlrditm report-
ed on in a couple of arncles. In fact, 
the most recent article concerning 
"Fighting for War and Peace" (Oct. 
29) made a nice point of that. 

However, I have yet to see any-
one propose a reasonable alternative 
to war as a means for achieving 
peace. You portrayed the speakers at 
the rally as fighting for war, and fur-
thennore, that the reasoning behind 
our beliefs was a sort of blind devo-
tion to the president and me 
Republican Party. Nothing could be 
further from the truth. 

Do you think anyone wants to see 
a war? Do you think that we got into 
World War n because we wanted to 
lose thousands of American lives? 
This situation is more analogous to 
that great war than it is to Vietnam, 
yet it seems that a minority of college

students (yes, a minority) are seeking 
to appear intdligent and "forward- . 
thinlcing" by opposing war, as many 
of our parents did during Vietnam. 

But this is not Vietnam. We are 
not attempting to depose a democra-
tically elected goverrunent. We are 
attempting to help Afghans depose 
their despots, the Taliban.

ize that as long as there are regimes

Coast. Perhaps if the terrorists had 
flown a plane into Telegraph 
Avenue, Berkeley would be singing 
a different tune. 

In any event, it seems that there is 
a lack of understanding of reality on 
the part of these peace protesters. 

FoDowing the rally, Roger 
Hedgecock broadcast his radio talk 
show live from the Price Center. 
The first peace pcotester to come on 
suggested an interesting "alterna-
tive" to war: Demilitarize the Middle 
East. That sounds like a great idea, 
but we are actually more likely to see 
Osama in Playboy than to see a 
peaceful denlilitarization of the 
world's most volatile region. 

Others have suggested simply 
changing U.S. foreign policy, and 
this view seems to have the most 
support. In particular, protesters 
suggest we should stop suppoiting 
Israel and stop sanctions on Iraq. 

WeD, other than the fact that 
Israel is the one democracy in the 
Middle East and that Saddam 
Hussein is selling millions of barrels 
of oil per year - but the profits go to 
his military, as usual - and that he is 
trying to ~uild weapons of mass 
destruction, there is the fact that such 
actions would not help end terrorism. 

Removing the Western presence 
in Islamic nations is not a solution. 
After all, cutting off ties between the 
wealthy and me poor is no way to 
improve the lot of the poor, and that 
is the situation we are dealing with. 
It is sad that so many Americans, 
including most peace protesters, 
malce it abundantly clear that they 
are not willing to sacrifice anything 
for the bettennent of the lives of 
people outside this COWl try. 

Until the people of the Middle 
East have enough education and 
economic stability not to see turning 
to Bin Laden's gross distortion of 
Islam as the only way to find mean-
ing in life, we will have the threat of 
terrorism against the United States 
and all that it represents: education, 
women's rights, religious freedom, a 
free press and democracy. 

To all you protesters against this 
battle for freedom: Remember all 
those Americans that fought during 
Vietnam to stop an unjust war, the 
ones that you so desperately want 
to be like? Well, in their old age 
they still believe Vietnam was 
unjust, but the overwhelnling 
majority of them support this war. 

Why? Because they actually had 
to be original baCk then to think of 
protesting an American war, which 
means they were the intelligent 
ones of the time. 

All I aSk is that before you blind-
ly follow what in the wake of 
Vietnam seems like the correct 
path, use the resources available to 
you here in me United States and 
educate yourself. 

War is not pretty, but in my own 
educated opinion, we have no other 
option to ensure our safety, our 
freedom and' our America.

I wish to speak to the recent 
assernons and accusations made by 
The &414 Editor in Chief George 
Liddle in a recent letter to the 
GUllrdia71 and on several other 
occasions. 

Liddle's criticism of Alpha 
Epsilon Pi circulates around the 
concerns brought by AEPi, the 
Union of Jewish Students and the 
Student Affirmative Action 
Committee regarding the latest . 
publication of The Koala, in which 
several racist and anti-Semitic jokes 
were printed. 

Contrary to the thoughts of The 
Koala, Alpha Epsilon Pi is not a 
racist or hateful organization. 
Furthermore, I resent Liddle 's 
efforts to steer the focus away from 
The Koala by blaming those who 
would stand up against his hatred. 

The &41a would have people 
believe that AEPi is a racist organiza-
tion because it has only taken offense 
to printings offensive to Jews. The 
ICotIIa has argued that AEPi is inher-
ently racist because it attempts to rein-
force the definitions between Jewish 

THURSDAY. NOVEMBER 8,2001 

people and the rest of campus. 
While I tHe to heart Liddle's 

suggestion that we should be more 
mindful of hate toward all conununi-
ties, the question of whether AEPi is 
racist has little to do with our past 
political stances. Would Liddle con-
demn all organizations that become 
increasingly sensitive to words that 
were specifically hateful toward their 
own? Simply because AEPi should 
have stood up to hateful speech in 
the past doesn't make the speech in 
the latest issue of The &41a any less 
abOminable. 

Further, I am surprised that The 
Koala woul" name a Jewish fraterni-
ty as an inherendy racist organiza-
tion simply because it attempts to 
tHe pride in a common heritage and 
culture. While Liddle would like to 
preach about a large campus com-
munity disrupted by the divisions of 
selective groups such as AEPi, per-
haps the reminder that anti-
Semitism is still vety much a reality 
reinforces these "communal bound-
aries." It is the hate found in The 
Koala that pushes people even fur-
ther toward their respective commu-
nities. 

I would also like to add that in the 
last year, AEPi donated over 100 
hours of commwuty service and over 
S3,000 toward philanthropic causes 
aimed at helping people throughout 
the world, regardless of heritage. 
What has the Koala done in the way 
of helping this "larger commwlity" 
that Liddle is so fond of referring to? 

The &41a is right in pointing to 
the issue as one of free speech. The 
question is not whether it has the 
right to print hateful content, 
because that is undoubtedly not in 
dispute. The real question is one of 
free speech for the studen ts of 
UCSD, because it is we as students 
who are forced to put our support 
behind these printings in the form of 
our money. 

As a Student whose money is allo-
cated by the A.S. Council, I am out-
raged dtat my money has funded 
such despicable content. Because The 
Koala is paid for by students, it is, in 
effect, an expression of our speech. 
Should the students of UCSD be 
compelled to find representation in a 
publication that plays upon racial 
injuries by the use of such words as 
"Kike"? There is a distinct difference 
between funding a newspaper, the 
content of which students nlight not 
agree with and funding speech that 
serves no greater purpose than to 
injure its targets. 

It is unfortwlate that Liddle uses 
the fact that he is Jewish to excuse 
me content of his paper. It is disap-
pointing that someone who appar-
endy identifies himself as aJew com-
mands such little knowledge of his 
heritage that he would not find the 
word "Kike" offensive. 

The id~ that the cr~tor of an 
anti-Semitic jOke is a member of that 
targeted group is irrelevant. The 
responsibility of editors is not to 
compel others to wonder who wrote 
the content and what it means to 
them, but to anticipate what its 
impact wiD be on readers. It is sad 
that Liddle has yet to learn this les-
son, and that he uses the fact that he 
is Jewish to excuse his actions. 

I would also like to add that 
AEPi has never pretended to 
oppose the very existence or sup-
port of The Koala. I hope it is clear 
that while we have taken offense to 
some of its printings, we have made 
no efforts to remove funding for 
The KDaia. 

As the president of AEPi, I am 
proud that issues-have been raised 
surrounding the latest publication 
of The Koala . If nothing else, UCSD 
has had a chance to take a second 
lOOk at its own representation and 
the issues surrowlding the publica-
tions that students fund . 

I am almost thankful to Liddle for 
being so inflexible with our original 
concerns because he has made this a 
much bigger issue than I ever intend-
ed. Regardless of his efforts to per-
sonally attack my chapter, it remain 
important to focus on the issues, not 
the people discussing them

Poll: College students support war 
Nationwide survey also shows little activism 

PROVIDENCE, R.I. 
College students in general 
strongly support U.S. military 
efforts in Afghanistan, according 
to a recent survey by the Institute 
of Politics at Harvard University, 
but students across the CoWl try 
are also involved in peace move-
ments on their campuses. 

Seventy-nine percent of col-
lege students nationwide support 
U.S.-led air strikes on Afghanistan 
and nearly two-thirds back using 
U.S. ground troops in the war, 
according to the poll of 1,200 ran-
domly selected undergraduates 
across the country. 

Seventy-one percent of male 
undergraduates said they would 
scm: if the draft were reinstated 
and they were selected, while 26 
percent said they would seek other 
options. 

"This year's survey of under-
graduates is critical because the 
bulk of the soldiers called to serve 
are young people," said former 
Arkansas Sen. David Pryor, direc-
tor of the Institute of Politics. 

The students polled between 
Oct. 17 and Oct. 25 also expressed 
strong approval of the federal gov-
ernment. Sixty percent of under-
graduates said they trust the gov-
ernment to "do the right thing," 
compared to 36 percent in 2000. 
Seventy-five percent trust the mil-
itary, while 69 percent trust the 
president and 62 percent trust 
Congress. 

The survey indicated a low 
political involvement among stu-
dents, as 72 percent said they did 
not participate in any govern-
ment, political or issues-oriented 
organization. 

However, 71 percent of the 
students said they have donated 
blood, given money or volun-
teered in relief efforts stemming 
from the Sept. 11 attacks. 

The poll, part of an annual 
study of college students' attitudes 
toward public service and govern-
ment, had a 2.8 percent margin of 
error. 

These ' numbers are low com-
pared to the 92 percent of the 
general population that supports 
the U.S.-led air strikes, according 
to an October ABC News survey. 

"The fact that student support 
for the war is so high is signifi-
cant," said Erin Ashwell, a 
Harvard senior who co-authored 
the report and developed the 
questions with the Boston-based 
opinion research firm 
SWRlDella Volpe. 

The sample is reflective of the 
general population of students at 
four-year colleges across the 
country, she said. 

Some students who are critical 
of the war said the results of the 
survey did not reflect the senti-
ments of students on their cam-
puses. 

Mary Jirmanus, a Harvard 
freshman and member of the 
Harvard Initiative for Peace and 
Justice, said she thinks a larger 
number of Harvard students are 
apathetic or against the war effort. 

"I would say there are a lot 
more people who are opposed to 
the use of military intervention 
than are doing stuff about it, " she 
said. "My friends would say they 
don't think what we are doing is 
right and would bring up the same 
arguments as I would, but they

Jirmanus said HIPJ's first rally 
attracted 800 students and the 
group has a mailing list of 200 stu-
dents, of which approximately 60 
to 70 are active organizers and 
parncipants. 

Jirmanus, who is also involved 
in the Boston Campus Anti-War 
Coalition, which represents the 
efforts of concerned students at 
colleges and universities in the 
greater Boston area, said the 
group is holding a regional cam-
pus conference against war and 
racism this weekend and expects 
300 students. 

Cornell University senior 
Dana Brown said she was sur-
prised by the survey's results. She 
said the opinions of Cornell stu-
dents on the issue of war are as 
diverse as the student body. 

As a coordinator of Students 
for Peaceful Justice, a group fear-
ful of war and organized as a 
response to Sept. 11, she said the 
group has a large number of par-
ticipants, many of whom are "not 
the usual suspects" one would 
expect in the peace movement. 

"I've been impressed with how 
large the numbers are that are 
opposed to war," Brown said. 
"Numerous students are wearing 
the white ribbons we handed out 
or signs that say 'Stop the injus-
tice,'" 

At Cornell, where three vigils 
are held each week, at least 100 
students are invoJved in helping in 
some way, she said.

Many frat houses 
banning alcohol 
Liability concerns prompt many 
Northwestern frats to go dry 

EVANSTON, Ill. - When 
Matthew Levin arrived on 
Northwestern University'S campus 
in 1991, he said the Greek scene 
was like something out of a bad 
movie. 

"We had all types of alcohol, all 
the time, all over campus," said 
Levin, former NU Interfraternity 
Council president. "There were 
kegs in the houses every day and 
parties all the time. We even used 
to have specific parties for specific 
types of drinks. " 

But since Levin's time, the 
Greek system has dried up and 
calmed down, as wet fraternities 
leave campus and dry chapters 
come back. 

Although fraternities are as 
strong in number as ever, some say 
the push toward a substance-free 
system has changed students' per-
spectives on fraternities and endan-
gers students by forcing them to go 
to unsupervised off-campus parties. 

In the past seven years, five wet 
fraternity chapters have left NU. In 
the past four years, five dry frater-
nities have recolonized or estab-
lished chapters in their places. The 
most recendy colonized fraternity 
allowing alcohol in its house, 
Sigma Phi Epsilon, came to cam-
pus in 1990. 

That trend likely will continue 
because of a university policy that 
gives preference to fraternities that 
want to establish substance-free 
housing, Vice President for 
Student Affairs William Banis said. 

Beta Theta Pi and Pi Kappa 
Alpha both left campus as wet 
houses and went dry upon their 
returns. Chapters that currently 
are suspended, Stich as Sigma Chi 
and Delta Kappa Epsilon, probably 
will have to come back to ,l:ampus 
with substance-free housing as 
well, Banis said. 

"I think in all probability that 
would be our preference, especially 
[considering) the histOry of some 
of them and how they closed tl,cir 
chapters at Normwestern," Banis 
said. 

In addition, seven wet chapters 
have gone dry in the past three 
years, leaving only five fraternities 
at NU that allow alcohol in their 
houses. One of these chapters, 
Delta Tau Delta, is currently on 
probation. 

For the university, part of the 
motivation behind substance-free 
housing is to prevent lawsuits 
stemming from alcohol-related 
incidents. 

Sean Thomas, associate direc-
tor of Greek affairs, said fraternity 
insurance costs have skyrocketed in 
recent years. Sorority insurance 
runs about S25 per member, while 
fraternity insurance costs about 
SIOO per member, Thomas said. 

Zeta Beta Tau President Frank 
Newell said fraternities can remain 
wet and safe as long as they plan 
their events responsibly.

Classic jazzman 
Dave Brubeck 
jams in San 
Diego 
The Dave Brubeck: 
Quartet will be 
accompanied by the 
San Diego Symphony 
By JOSEPH LEE 
Hiatus Editor 

Dave Brubeck is an American music icon. . The life of Brubeck is a long and 
amazing journey. As a teenager in the 
1930s, Brubeck started to play profes-
siona ll y in small dance clubs. While in 
college, he abandoned the idea of 
becoming a veterinarian and pursued 
music. Brubeck served under Genera l 
Patton in World War II, and after he 
was discharged in 1946, he continued 
his musical journey. 

He formed his trio with Cal Tjader 
and Ron Crotty in 1949 and then 
added saxophonist Paul Demond in 
1951. This was the beginning of an 
IIlcredible musical partnership with 
Desmond that yielded dozens of hits 
that are classics today. 

Brubeck and Desmond stepped 
away from common 4/4 time and 
dived into deeper waters with 9/8 rime 
signatures and influences from African 
folk music and even Turkish folk 
rhythms. 

With Desmond came the hit 
"Take Five," which is a familiar song 
that has made appearances in televi-
sion commercials and has been a con-
stant standard in jazz clubs around 
town. 

Brubeck also toured with the likes 
of Stan Getz, Duke Ellington, Charlie 
Parker and Dizzy Gillespie. As a 
musical innovator, Brubeck also per-
formed and recorded with Leonard 
Bernstein and the New York 
Philharmonic. 

Brubeck is also socially progressive. 
I Ie was insistent on add ing an African-
American bassist Eugene Wright to 
the band in the early 19605, which cost 
hllll shows in the South. 

The president of one college 
refused to let the baml play in the 
midst of students demanding that they 
perform. \Vith an intervention by the 
governor, the band was allowed to play 
if Wright was hidden backstage. But 
Brubeck told Wright that his mic was 
broken and when Wright's fea ture solo 
came up, Brubeck had instructed 
Wright to play at the very front with 
Brubeck's speaking mic. 

Brubeck is now graced with a 
Lifetime Achievement Award by the 
National Academy of Recording Arts 
and Sciences. In 1999, he was named a 
J azz Master by the National 
Endowment for the Arts (NEA). In 
1994, he was honored with the 

ational Medal of the Arts from the 
I EA in a \Vhite House ceremony. He 
has also been awarded a Grammy 
Lifetime Achievement Award. 

Even in his mid-70s, Brubeck keeps 
himself busy. He still composes, 
records and embarks on international 
tours. Perhaps there is a fountain of 
youth hidden within the beautiful 
rhythms of jazz. 

Dave Brubeck and the Dave Brubeck 
Quartet will be at the Copley Symphony 
Hall as a part of the Winter Pops Series on 
Nov. 9 and 10. Look to the Hiatus Calendar 
on pg. 12 for details on the show.

Interview with the director of 'Dracula' 
A talk wi!h Tony Award-winning director Des McAnuff on the musical 'Dracula' 
By JESSICA LONG 
Contributing Writer 

The sights and sounds of Halloween have passed, but there is sti ll plenty of terror 
at the La J olla Playhouse as the 
first performances of "Dracula" 
continue to sell out night after 
night. This newest take on an old 
tale is directed by two-time Tony 
Awa rd -winning director Des 
McAnuff, who has done exten-
sive work in theater and in fi lm. 

There arc many things that 
make this production of 
"Dracula" unique. One of them is 
all the special effects. 

"[The use of special effects] 
allows you to dream on a larger 
scalc," McAnuff said. " It allows 
me to develop image chains and 

- ideas that I would not be able to 
do without this techno logy." 

"Just to get through a techni-
cal rehearsal is painful," McAnuff 
admi ts, however, and of course, 
there were things that just could 
not be managed. 

McAnuff said he had original-
ly wanted:a curtain of fog of mist 
- so that on the whole front of 
the stage, the fog just pours like 
Niagara Falls to the stage floor." 

However, he said that this 
could not be accomplished. 

"The air currents in this the-
ater - and I speak from years of 

Des 
McAnuff

La Jolla Playhouse 

experience with that stage - are 
just terrible," he said. 

McAnuff has other things on 
his mind: H e is also the artistic 
director for the La Jolla Playhouse. 
This means that he is in charge of 
picking out the Playhouse's plays 
for the next few years. 

"We have a lot of commissions 
out ... so we have a lot of work in 
development," he said. "You'll see 
a lot of new work in the coming 

years, that's for sure. We'll contin-
ue to do stupidly big musicals like 
this one, I'm sure, even though 
they may not be good for us." 

According to McAnuff, this 
new work should be interesting 
because of the influence of the 
events of Sept. 1 I. 

"I think two things will hap-
pen," he said. "I think we'll see a 
rise in what you might refer to as 
'escapist theater,' because it is 
important for people to use the 
theater in that fashion when it is 
suitable, or when it is applicable. 

"And then I think there will be 
a reaction on the completely oppo-
site [side]," he said. "1 think during 
war times, serious times, there 
tends to be serious writing, too. 
During times of connict and stress, 
there are always issues to debate 
and discuss, and the theater is the 
oldest social, moral and political 
platform in Western civilization." 

McAnuff said he would really 
love to do "Shakespeares whole 
tetrology from 'Richard II' to 
'Henry V' .. . because r think 

Shakespeare managed to witness 
these shifts in history that actual-
ly apply to all ages. 

"I would love for you to come 
and see all four productions over a 
long weekend," he said, "so you 
could see what that whole thing 
was about." 

He said that he hopes that 
UCSD students will come to see it. 

"It's sad when I walk around 
campus thinking... tbat some of 
these students are never actually 
going to see a play at the La Jolla 
Playhouse," he said. "It 's just sad. 
I think it should be a part of your 
career here." 

"[Dracula is] sexy, passionate, 
scary, smart," McAnuff said. "I 
think it definitely has appeal on 
all kinds of levels. It's a great story 
... it's about a group of young peo-
ple banding together to fight ' a 
dark, overwhelming force ... it's 
very much about a young genera-
tion kind of finding itself."

19505: 
Pop culture takes a 
stronghold during the '50s 
Continued from JMP 8 
NAACP and massive movements like 
the Montgomery bus boycott of 1956. 

At the same time, Mexicans were 
being rounded up and forced to 
return to Mexico with Operation 
Wetbaclc. This program, meant to 
send Mexicans back who came here 
illegally after the Bracero program 
brought many over as agricultural 
workers, was also used to force many 
Spanish-speaking people to return 
to Mexico despite their legal status. 

Irish, Italian and Jewish people 
were also excluded from Protestant-
run housing and country clubs, as 
recounted by UCSD literature pro-
fessor Winnie Woodhull . 

Woodhull says that Italians and 
Irish often occupied poorer urban 
areas, while the Jewish, who were 
able to "infiltrate" the white suburbs, 
were still discriminated against. 
Essentially, anyone not of White 
Anglo-Saxon Protestant descent was 
not welcome in the 1950s. 

Many times, when we look back 
on the J 950s, this infonnation is 
largely ignored while the positive 
aspects like movies and music that 
came out . of it are exemplified as 
being indicative of that time peri-
od. Although many could not par-
ticipate, the dominant culture teUs 
a lot about the people of the time 
and their ideals. 

Genesis of 1V Classics 
Of all technological inventions, 

the most marvelous must be the 
television. 

The first '"practical" television 
system was made in the 1940s, and 
by the early 1950s, many middle 
class white families had one. 

But television back then was not 
like it is now. All programs were in 
black and white, and there were no 
remote controls (gasp!), and shows 
were only on in the evenings and 
afternoons. Yet despite this small 
amount of programming, the popu-
larity of television grew dramatical-
ly; people soon gathered around the 
windows of shops hoping to see this 
nifty new marvel. 

While radio had been the main 
form of mass communication in pre-
ceding decades, television displaced 
the importance of radio, as can be 
seen by looking at the move of radio 
shows to television such as "I Love 
Lucy" and "Amos and Andy." 

With the appearance of televi-
sion, a whole new lineup of enter-
tainment genres also popped up 
including sitcoms, westerns, quiz 
shows and dramas. 

The most popular sitcoms of the 
1950s were the family shows that 
appealed to white audiences - shows 
such as "The Honeymooners," "I 
Love Lucy," "Dennis the Menace, " 
"Make Room for Daddy" and many 
others that we still remember today. 
Although slighdy different, these 
shows portrayed relatively stable 
families with working fathers, com-
placent stay-at-home wives and mis-
chievous children. 

There was controversy over 
television shows, however, that 
upset the television viewing public. 
When "Amos and Andy" was a 
radio show, it had two white men 
portraying two African-American 
men: actors Freeman Gosden and 
Charles Correll. When the show 
moved to television, the characters 
were portrayed by two black men: 
actors Alvin Childress and Spencer 
Williams. But the characters were 
offensive, .and with the help of the 
NAACP, CBS cancelled the show 
in '53 . The times were changing, 
and this type of degrading enter-
tainment was no longer accepted. 

And who doesn 't love game 
shows? III the '50s, game shows 
were int\!nsely popular. Each 
Sunday, thousands would tune in to 
watch "The $64,000 Question." 
New quiz shows like "The Price is 
Right," "What's My Line?" and 
"Twenty-One" were immensely

'Dracula, The Musical' surpasses conventions 'Heist' fails to' steal the show 
due to unnecessary dialogue Unique production leaves audience thirsting for more 

By SABRI NA MORRIS 
Staff Writer 

YoU will no t find a better show in town than " Dracul a: T he Musical." Although the name 
" Dracula" conjures rhe cl ass ic 
Image of a man bedecked in a 
black, collared cape, fangs drip-
ping with blood and a wily stare, 
this particular La Jolla Playhouse 
production magically steers clear 
of such cliches. And although we 
hear the word "musical" and auto-
matically think of a corny story 
with happy, dancing people, 
"Dracula" also avoids that particu-
lar cliche. 

"Dracula" succeeds at side-
stepping any corniness and cre-
atc a play that closely follows the 
original story, enhanced by the 
score . 

\Vithout a doubt, this play has 
the breedi ng of Broadway with its 
solid performances, meticulous set 
desif,'11 and exquisi te visua l effects. 
Created by the " Dracula" dream 
team includi ng two-time Tony 
Award-winning director and 
writer Des McAnuff, with book 
and lyrics by Academy Award- and 
Tony Award-winners Don Black 
and Christopher I lampton, and 
music by veteran composer Frank 
\vildhorn, this is a play that 
proves to be this season' s crown 
Jewel at rhe La J olla Playhouse. 

or only does Dracula , played 
by 10 m Hewitt, rise to the occa-
sion (from the undead) by provid-
ing a larger-than-life perfor-

Theater 
REVIEW 

some scenes, on specific devices of 
the set design. Frequently, the 
actors are transported to and fro 
across the stage by these devices, 
rendering an even eerier feel to 
the play. 

Standard heist film adds nothing ne':J to the 
tried-and-true con-artist formula 

When asked what UCSD stu-
dents might enjoy most about 
this production, Hewitt replied, 
"It is the closest adaptation to 
Bram Stoker's novel and the 
script retains that eerie, creepy 
poetry that appeals to a lot of 
people." 

Augmenting the actors' perfor-
mances, such as that of lead female 
and lust-object Mina aenn Morse) 
is a striking set design. In fact, the 
set alone is a reason to go see this 
play. Operated by hydraulics and 
an ingenious inlay of contraptions, 
the actors are able to fly offstage, 
drop down chutes, float through 
scenes, and even becolne a part of 
the set. 

The very first scene, for 
instance, is quite stunning with its 
mechanized horse-drawn carriage 
and arrestingly black-clad vam-
pire, who later disappears vertical: 
Iy off the stage in a split second 
without a sound. 

By not having stage hands 
moving and shi~ting the set, the 
various scenes have more free-
dom to play out the story without 
the difficulties of timing and 
what is known in theater as 
"blocki ng." 

Also, the members of the audi-
ence really lose themselves in the 
tory by not having to sit through 

set shifting. The staging revolves 
around the main actors rather 
than the other waJl around. The 
secondary actors then become a 
part of the scenery as they hang, in 

The costumes also play a 
toothsome role in the musical. As 
actors dangle from the swift 
motion of the set pieces, some of 
their costumes contribute to the 
phantasmal design that never 
ceases to enthra ll the audience 
throughout the performance. 

The costuming also delivers 
Count Dracula from that odious 
realm of tasteless cliche as he is 
first introduced to us in a white 
wig and trailing Victorian house-
coat. 

The lighting and music syn-
chronize to give the actors a 
tremendous appearance and an 
appropriately placed sense of 
drama and horror. The musical 
score itself is fastidiously carried 
out with each scene and the visual 
results of the lighting reinforce 
the unsettling effect. 

"Dracula: T he Musical" has all 
the key rngredients for a delicious 
theater experience. It holds the 
power to attract all , even non-
playgoers. 

The poetical script will appeal 
to literary audiences while the 
special effects and gore will appeal 
to those more inclined to violent, 
action-packed entertainment. 

T he music will appeal to the 
sensitive while the drama will 
appeal to sensationalists, and even 
for those just after " hot 
chicks, "this play will appeal to 
them. 

No matter what, this is not a 
play to be missed.

" Joe Moore is so cold, when he 
sleeps, sheep count him." So 
goes tile description of Gene 

Hackman's character in his latest 
fi lm "Heist." 

Problem is, our appreciation for 
"Heist" is as cold as its own stylistic 
world of thieves. 

When Moore's face is caught on 
camera during a robbery, he and his 
band of merry men, Bobby Blane 
(Delroy Lindo) and Pinky Pincus 
(Don Pincus), plan to leave their 
life of crime. But when Moore's 
shady employer, Bergman (Danny 
DeVito), refuses to pay up and 
insists on another job, Moore and 
his men must comply with the 
added and unwanted manpower of 
Bergman's nephew. 

Why not just walk away? 
Because according to Moore, 
"Love makes the world go ' round: 
love of gold." 

"Heist" seems timeless.

terned shirts, Lindo's Coke-bottle 
glasses and the monochromatic 
visual tone of the film, one begins 
to wonder what era the cast is in 

. and whether the characters are sim-
ply living in a time warp. 

Whi le the monochro matic 
ambiance does take our focus away 
from the film's surroundings, it 
draws our attention to the convo-
luted dialogue of the characters.

REVIEW 

Stylistically, the banter 
between individuals is unique, yet 
the effect is more of an middle-
aged thieve's jargon that is hard to 
understand. 

Despite the difficult dialogue, 
the physical interaction between 
the characters adds 'to the sense of 
a well -oiled theft operation. [t 
turns out that experience does in 
fact come with age. Unfortunately, 
an audience that is too inexperi-
enced with tile art of robbery will 
be unable to fully appreciate the 
lingo. 

Surprisingly, "Heist" lacks many 
of the formulaic con movie must-
haves. There is no car chase, but 
they do manage to blow something 
up - twice. 

"Anybody can get the goods. 
Hard part is getting out," Moore 
quips . While "Heist" delivers a 
interesting modification to the 
standard con movie, the goods are 
hardly worth leaving with.

THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 8, 2001 THE UCSD GUARDIAN HIATU II 

Page is SO's incarnation of Bob Dylan 
Gregory Page is an integral part of the SO scene 
By UNDSAY BOYD 
Staff Writer 

When one thinks of folk singers, Leonard Cohen, Bob Dylan or J ames Taylor may come to mind - a lone, guitar-
toting songster with a quiet sensitivity, a mys-
terious darkness and a fierce independence. 

By that definition. Gregory Page is a folk 
singer. 

His beautiful melodies and poignant lyrics 
have been an indispensable part of San 
Diego's music scene since the release of his 
first album, "The Romantic Adventures of 
Harry" in 1994. Since then, he has penned 
five albums of unrequited love songs and bit-
tersweet stories that have been devoured by 
San Diego music fa ns. While Page may 
cringe at the idea of being categorized as a 
folkie - for his music transcends many gen-
res - the romantic adventures of Page are as 
good as folk-singer stories come. 

Born in London, Page has music in his 
blood. 

"I grew up in a musical fami ly," he 
explained over a cup of coffee at a cafe in 
Normal Heights. "My grandfather played the 
Irish pipes ... so I always grew up with Irish 
lusic around. My mom played in a band that 

opened for the Beatles in 1965 in Spain." 
However, it was not until he moved to San 

Diego in 1976 that he says he discovered 
songwriters like Dylan and Neil Young 
through a friend . 

In 1989, Page met up with another song-
writer who would inspire him while playing 

cover songs at a bar called The Packing 
House. 

"I wasn't writing yet ... I was just playing 
all the songs I loved to learn." 

That other songwriter is another favorite 
of the San D iego music scene, Steve Poltz. 

"I met Poltz, and watching him and being 
friends with him inspired me to write and I 
wrote my first album, 'The Romantic 
Adventures of Harry,' after the bartender at 
this bar fina lly left me," Page said. 

On 1994\; "Harry," Page found the inti -
mate style that he would come to be known for. 

"The first song that I wrote that I felt was 
really worth a shit was a song called 'My 
Revelation,'" he said. "Then I wrote 'Please 
Remember' ... That kind of gave me the con-
fidence to feel like I could tell people I'm a 
musician without having to stutter." 

Next, Page left his stint playing bass with 
San Diego band The Rugburns to record an 
album with former bass-player John Doe, 
which included the songs "Fare Thee Well," 
"Blue" and "Cocktails and Cold Hearts." 
There would be three more albums to follow: 
"And I look up," "Music for Mortals" and 
"Grace In Arms" - all of which are on Page's 
own Bed Pan recording label, which he runs 
out of his home. 

While his body of work is substantial, 
Page does not consider himself particularly 
prolific. 

"You can always find reasons not to write," 
Page said. "The times I feel like I'm ready to

'Amelie' playfully enchants the audience 
French film touches on humor, kindness of humanity 
By ANNE CONG-HUYEN 
Staff Writer 

The romantic French film "Amelie," by the director ot "Alien Resurrection," Jean-Pierre Jeunet, traces the life of the 
independent young Parisian Amclie Poulain 
as she goes about changing the lives of those 
around her: some for the better, some for the 
worse. As she enchantingly and humorously 
sets her universe in motion, Amelie realizes 
that she is incredibly brave and scheming 
when it comes to the lives of others, but when 
it comes to her own, she is painfully shy. 

Noticing that his past films are mostly dark, 
Jeunet set out to produce this "truly positive 
film." Casting a fairyta le-like enchanmlent on 
Paris as he films Amelie\; humorous antics, 
Jeunet captures a realistic heroine, played to 
perfection by Audrey Tautou, and purposeful-
ly evokes emotion through his 'innovative use 
of the camera and a perfect amount of com-
puter animation. Both add even more magic to 
this already charming movie. 

From the very beginning, Jeunet brings 
the audience into the film by di rectly 
addressing them and informing them of the 
"likes" and "dislikes" of each person . 
Although they seem random, whimsically 
humorous preferences, they make each char-
acte r more real. Throughout the film,

REVIEW 

Amelie continues to talk to the audience to 
keep tIlem following the plotline. 

Mathieu Kassovitz (the mugger from "The 
Fifth Element") plays Amelie's equally quirky 
love interest. Although he doesn't meet the 
American ideal of "hul}k." the audience can-
not help but fal l in love with him. 

Al though some of the characters are 
sometimes too annoying to be liked (such as 
Serge Merl in's character, J oseph) they sti ll 
add to the rea listic atmosphere of the fi lm. 

This is the best movie to appear in quite a 
while, so don't discriminate against it because 
it's foreign, because it wi ll leave you feeling 
thoroughly satisfied (even if you're a guy).

You have to love the guys 
that grab British-pop sensibility 
and toss in some American fla· 
voring to give it a kick. You get 
that sound with Pete Yorn on 
songs such as "Life on a Chain." 
Yorn also has a fantastic support-
Ing cast. Remy Zero has been

Spacing out with SO local

Hip-hop and jazz quartet prove that jazz is 
alive and well in San Diego 
By JOSEPH LEE 
Hiatus Editor 

Tommy is circling the street desperately looki n g for an elusive Paci fic Beach parking 
spot. Clay and I are engaged in 
some small talle and I am getting 
hints about Ivan's sexual escapades. 

· We're trying to sleep our way 
to the top, but Ivan is gettin g damn 
ti red," laughs C lay. 

This is Spaceman Spiff. Four 
20-somethin g San D iego guys 
looking to make it big in the music 
industry. They work hard and play 
hard. They play gigs at coffee 
shops, bars, weddings and parties 
for pretty much anyone who will 
take them. 

But this is not some indie-
pu nle-rock - th ree-chord - th rash-
trash band trying to learn its Blinlc-
182 covers so it can get a li ttle 
booty. These guys are a bona fide 
jazz combo and they are damn 
good at what they do. Playing 

everything from straight-ahead 
jazz standards to their original 
work, which consists of a sweeter, 
fu nkier sound, they are traveling 
San Diego and beyond to malee 
themselves lcnown. 

Clay is the man on the horns. 
With a degree in jazz performance 
from San Diego State University, 
Clay constantly switches between 
the sax and the flute and also helps 
out on the vocals. Tommy is the 
rocle-steady guitar player comple-
mented by Mikey, the drummer 
who can easi ly splice together some 
basic jazz rhythms with complex 
hip-hop grooves. Ivan is the lady 
killer with his funky bass-playing 
and his sultry vocals, not to men-
tion a degree from the California 
Institute for the Arts.

popular, despite the fact that some 
of the gal . were rigged. 

While :: e trusting public had 
been rooting for contestants they 
thought should win, behind the 
scenes, favorable contestants were 
given the answers beforehand. On 
the show "twenty-One," Charles 
Van Doren won $1 29,000 with the 
help of producers. On "The $64,000 
Q ues tion," however, Dr. Joyce 
Brothers proved the television gods 
wrong when she won $64,000 after 
being preselected to lose. 

And who ca n forget Walt 
Disney? 

. As the pioneer in children's and 
family entertainment, Disney pro-
duced numerous family films - ani -
mated and live action - from "Snow 
White" to "Old Yeller."Jn the 1950s, 
with the invention of television, 
Disney produced "The Wonderful 
World of Disney," and probably the 
most historic of these shows was 
"The Mickey Mouse Club." 

Interestingly enough, in "The 
Mickey Mouse Club," all of the 
kids were homogeneously Anglo-

Ameri c~ n , as po inted out by

An epic DVO 
that 
compliments 
an epic film 
lOr. Zhivago' is 

bro~ght back to life 
36 years after its 
original release 
By CHARLIE TRAN 
Hiatus Editor 

Epic films requ ire more than a gripping, adventurous plot. An epic requires close identifica-
tion with the cen t ral character, 
brea thtaking cinematography and 
expansive plotlines. Such is the case 
wi th not only the 1965 fil m 
"Doctor Zhivago," 'but also its 
long-awaited DVD debut, which is 
of grea t quality and loaded with 
extra information. 

Based on Bori s Pasternak 's 
novel, the story is based on the 

@f--REV-~:-: 
odyssey of Dr. Z h ivago (Omar 
Sharif) during the Russian 
Revolution. The movie chronicles 
Zhivago's anempt to raise a family 
wi th the aristocratic Tonya 
(Geraldine Chaplin) but also main-
ta in his love for a nurse named Lara 
Qulie Christie). Zhivago not only 
has to deal with war but also the 
love he has for the two ladies in his 
life. 

What separates this two-DVD 
set fro m others is not only the 
amount of the supplementals pro-
vided, but al so the quality of the 
restoration of the old film. 

Shown in widescreen , the 
v.ideo quality is superb and very 
good considering its age. This 
fi lm is 36 years old , and with the 
touch-up work done, it almost 
looks fresh out of the theater. The 
richness of the colors are apparent 
throughout the film, especially

who changed his name to Don 
Grady. 

Other successful themed pro-
grams were "Fantasy Land," 
"Frontier Land" and "Tomorrow 
Land" (Are these starting to sound 
fami liar?). 

T here were also many other 
programs that helped define the 
'50s, such as "American 
Bandstand," "Superman," "Zorro" 
and don 't forget boxing. But films, 
which had been waning with the 
introduction of television, were 
also a major part of the 1950s. 
The Silver Screen 

Woodhull recalled that in the 
'50s, young children were often 
given two quarters to see the pic-
tures on the weekends - one for 
the movie and one for a snack. Oh, 
the good 01' days. 

The movies then were sur-
rounded by an ambience of magic 
and wonder that accompanied the 
scene of children and teens seeing 
new movies and experiencing new 
technology like 3 -D pictures and 
drive-ins. 

The starlets and the heartthrobs 
of the 1950s caught the attention of 
people across the country, especially 
those of teens. With the introduc-
tion of Elvis, Mari lyn Monroe and 
other teen magnets, teens suddenly 
emerged as a sociological category. 

Rebellion and sex became appeal-
ing as stars like Marlon Brando,James 

T HE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Dean and Paul Newman appeared in 
Hollywood. Films like "Rebel 
Without a Cause" or "East of Eden" 
portrayed the rebellion and con flier 
that existed. The growing importance 
of teens can also be seen in literary 
works that came out of the '50s like 
J.D. Salinger's "Catcher in the Ryc" 
and Jacle Kerouacs "On The Road." 

Alfred Hitchcock perfected the 
genre of horror films during the

1950s. How can anyone forget his 
class ic movies like "Psycho," 
"Vertigo" or " Rear Window"? 
Although Hitchcock was falllous for 
these types of films, we musrn't for-
get h is great romantic thrille rs or 
adventures like "To Catch a T hief," 
"Suspicion" and "Strangers on a 
Trai n." It 's these films that cement-

ed the careers and populari ty of 
Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman. 

The alluring Elizabeth Taylor, a 
definitive star by the 1950s, had 
several groundbreaking perfor-
mances during this decade in films 
such as "Giant" (with J ames Dean) 
and "Cat on a Hot tin Roor ' (oppo-
site Paul Newman). But her perfor-
mances nO! only ensured her posi-
tion as an inva luable actress, they 
also established the career of writer 
Tennessee Wi ll iams, who wrote 
many dramas that took place in the 
South. His most famous works 
include "A Streetcar Named 
Desire," "Cat on a Hot Tin Roor' 
and "The Glass Menagerie." 

Will iams' "A Streetcar Named 
Desire," starring Marlon Brando, 
was directed by Elia Kazan. One of 
the most respected di rectors 01 his 
time, Kazan also direc ted the 
equa lly powerfu l and gripping films 
"East of Eden" and "On the 
Waterfront." T hese fi lms present-
ed very strong messages about 
ocial classes, family structure, age 

diffe rences and the postwar era. 
To accomplish this he took big 

risks by employing very powerful, 
young actors like Dean and Brando. 
Despite his accompl ishments in 
fi lm, his name later became marred 
during the McCarthy trials. 

And we can't overlook the 
romances that defin ed this era : 
romances starri ng Audrey 
Il epburn, Gregory Peck, James

Stewart, Katherine Hepburn, CJI)' 
Grant and many others. This was 
when romance stories were still new 
and when movies actually had,plots. 
In addi tion to romances, comedies 
were also very prominent, making 
comedians such as Jerry Lewis cul-
tura l icons. Although there arc

ological category and force for 
change, advancements in film 
were made, television debuted, 
and rock 'n' roll and R&B began 
their ascent. Although there were 
many more cultural aspects of the 
'50s, we start to sense the grow-
ing wave of rebellion of teens in 
the television shows, movies and 
music of the time that would 
eventually grow into the full 
counterculture movement of the 
I 960s.

"Our son Todd told us about Tobin and we immediately called him 
to help us find a place. We were extremely pleased with his vast 
knowledge of the area and his care for safety. We sent Tobin out 
with Todd to find a place, and Tobin did an awesome job. He has 
been extremely helpful, and is always there for you! We trusted him 
to find a place for our son and so should you."

Page: 
Gregory' Page: Music to slit 
you r wnsts by. 
Continued from page 11 
write would be the times I'm bored 

is different for everybody. 
Somebody like Steve, he writes all 
the time, constantly writing. 1 think 
I write maybe 10 songs a year." 

Prolific or not, Page has a new 
album coming out this year, which 
he says will not be the traditional 
Page music to slit your wrists by-
even though it is tentatively titled 
"Unhappy Hour." 

"It's the most up-tempo, happy 
album," Page sa id. "This is a 
reprieve. Everybody gets a chance 
to sit back and maybe bop their 
heads. 1 love the way it sounds." 

Recorded in El Cajon, Los 
Angeles and his home studio, this 
album has a more produced texture 
than past Page albums. 

"1 try to get that feeling of flight 
in music," he said. This is why Page 
originally considered calling his 
new album "Fell to Earth." 

These days, Page says he's con-
tent with where his adventures have 
led him. 

"I feel successful that 1 have 
enough friends to come out and see 
me play that I don 't have to have a 
job, and that is success to me." 

Lately, he's been more involved 
producing (he just finished the new 
Jason Mraz album) than playing in 
public. He plays a weekly gig with 
his band, the Hatchet Brothers, and 
is a regular atJava Joe's, which has 
long been a haven for San Diego 
folkies. 

"It's the most famous coffee shop 
in, probably, the world." Page said. 

AtJavaJoe's, with the faint sound 
of coffee cups clanking, Page's music 
can be truly appreciated. The peo-
ple who fill the seats at a Page show 
know every word to every song. His 
songs have provided many people 
with a soundtrack to their own 
romantic adventures. 

To order any of Page's CDs, go 
to Java joe's online store at 
wwwJIlVlltS.org. To get his new 
album, check out his CD release 
party at Java Joe's on Dec. 15.

1M VOLLEYBALL RANKINGS 
HIT THE STREETS! 

As we move into the month of November, you get the feel that sports are back 

~ again in America. As we stand guard and ever vigilant about the goings on around us, we still can't seem to give up our sports, can we? And for heaven's sake, that's gotta be OK, doesn't it? We need stress-busters now like we need fresh air to breathe. Don't we? , And sports seem to fill the bill for many of us. Whether it's the big-time scene .. . The World Series, the new NBA season, the BCS dilemma with college football, or 
NFL parity ... or the local college stuff at UCSD with the success of our women's soc-

cer and volleyball intercollegiate programs .... it's all good isn't it? Of course. 
But let's not stop there. After all , more of you are playing your own favorite sports through our intramu-

ral sports program, than ~ II of that other stuff put together. So let's get some of that hype going in your 
direction too!

this week, are the initial 1M Men's and Women's Volleyball Rankings. We are four weeks in , with two

Comment. 

Top rated, but definitely has the capacity to self destruct 
Big time team speed, but stepping up in class 
Best team in easy league, untested 
They play on emotion with league leading sideline support 

Only 1 loss and that was to highly rated Fallen (see Men's MA) 
Retro, 80s offense led 1M's in scoring - look out! 
Was team-to-beat until personnel changes - ???? 
Rock solid 0 , hungry to lace 'em up and play after some forfeits 

Grind it out Big-10 style wears down opponents 
Lone loss was a close one, has a nose for the finish line 
Ducked game with Da Kine, hard to tell how they'll stack up 
Black and silver edgy attitude only pisses off refs 

Top scoring team has it figured out 
Not spending nearly enough time in the oppositions offensive backfield 
Class of the field if they show up, FLAKES! 
Lost by 1 in a thriller against BTY - could get a second chance 

THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 8, 2001 

Kosong Villagers put on an 
incredible performance 
Colorful production shows anger, seduction 
and comedy, satirizing the upf)er class 
Iy HEATHEI CUlK 
Staff Writer 

The Nov. 4 Mandeville Auditorium production of "Kosong Okwangedae," a 
masked dance of the Kosong vil-
lage of South Korea, sounded like 
it would be another sleeper, but 
turned out to be incredible enter-
tainment. 

Featuring distjnctive form of 
dance that originated in the 10th 
century and became more broadly 
established in the 18th century, this 
show is a historical part of the 
Kosong society that still has impact 
with its strong emotion and politi-

Broken into five parts including

fall between the cracks with their

But they keep working. 
"[Playing gigs is) all we're 

doing right now," Clay says. "I 
mean, we all kind of have back-up 
plans, but this is, like, do-or-die

Ivan, who credits Stevie 
Wonder, Prince and Bob Marley as 
his influences, does not hide his 
ambition. 

"I want to be a rock star, make 
lots of money and sell lots of 
records." 

Their sound is a combination of 
jazz, reggae and hip-hop. Light 
horns are complimented by a funk-
driven bass line and Ivan's voice. 
The smooth guitar sound and the 
energetic, syncopated rhythm of 
the drums round out the entire 
Spiff sonic experience. It is slow 
and mellow enough to have a 
romantic moment and fast and 
melodic enough to get the feet 
moving. 

"What we do is have some 
improvisation and some freedom 
with being creative," Mikey says. 
"It's about creating something new

Not only is there a feature-length 
commentary by Sharif and Rod 
Steiger, but there is also a music-
only track. Unlike many commen-
taries, this one is not only relevant 
to the understanding of the. film, 
but also has many anecdotes. 

Although the sound is in Dolby

old to be salvaged according to 
today's standard. However, 

The performers, farmers from 
the village of Kosong, are traveling 
in the off-season, using the move-

farming to create a dance full of 
the emotion of the common peo-

With rhythms inspired by the 
breathing of a worker, and move-
ments inspired by the act of farm-

some of the audience drove down 
all the way from San Francisco to 
see this show. 

Full of humor, scenes from the 
play include a monk being seduced 
and an aristocrat caught by his

his pregnant mistress.

asked about their favorite place to

respond, almost unison, "The 
Onyx Room." 

Spaceman Spiff has always had 
success at The Onyx Room with an 
audience that understands and also 
loves them. And the club is happy 
because Spiff regularly packs the 
joint. 

"We own that place," Clay 
said. "We're gonna start playing 
[The Onyx Room) every other 
week. See, that's the big thing 
with us, it's the clubs. The rock 
clubs don't work for us, but The 
Onyx Room is so conducive to 
what we do. It makes sense to nur-
ture that and build our own 
scene." 

The Spaceman Spiff sound will 
energize the heart and soul of any-
one who cares to listen. Their pas-
sion and dedication to the music is 
clearly marked on the musicians' 
faces. 

As Clay said, "Spiff doesn't 
know how to do anything else." 

Jam on. 

MauriceJarre's bittersweet, memo-
rable score makes up the differ-

It has been i long wait to see

"Dr, Zhivago" has a DVD that 
matches the grand scope of the

Iy IOSH ClOUSE 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD men's water polo 
team dropped a tough nonconfer-
ence match against seventh-ranked 
UC Irvine on Sunday afternoon at 
the Anteater Aquatics Complex in 
Irvine, Calif. 

The Tritons fell to 18-5 on the 
season with the 11-9 loss, while the 
Anteaters improved to 5 - 10 overall , 

The two teams ended the first 
quarter tied at two before Kellan

Selig should consider 
the loss of fans 
Continued from page 20 

The owners of the two baseball 
teams that get the ax will profit as 
well by being able to unload money-
losing franchises for the nice sum of 
$250 million. To put this in perspec-
tive, the Expos generated about $)6 
lnillion last season compared to the 
Yankees' $200 million income. Tell 
me that the Yanks haven't bought the 
World Series. 

Obviously, this decision would 
affect the players as well because 
they would have to be distributed 
to other teams - causi ng another 
debate on how to assign players 
fai rly - which would subsequently 
force some of the players already 
on the team down to the minor 
leagues. 

But the benefit of this - assum-
ing that the players can be distrib-

Hori scored to give UCSD a 3-2 
lead with 6: 18 remaining in the sec-
ond quarter. UC Irvine answered 
with a pair of goals from Chris 
Kirchwehm and a single score from 
freshman Dreason Barry to give the 
Anteaters the 5-4 halftime lead. 

The Tritons kept it close in the 
third quarter and headed into the 
fourth down by only a single goal. 
UC Irvine put UCSD away with 
four goals in the final quarter to 
preserve the slim two-goal victory. 

The Anteaters ' were led by 

uted fairly - is that the talent level 
in the league will increase. If some 
sort of lottery system based on the 
worst record were installed, the 
teams at the bottom ranks of Major 
League Baseball would be able to 
gain some of the talent they sorely 
need in order to compete with the 
rest of the league. 

The overall benefits for the 
league would be that the gap 
between the league's elite and the 
bottom-feeders would decrease, 
competition would get a little more 
intense and perhaps there would be 
fewer teams that are all but elimi-
nated by the All-Star break. 

This is definitely a benefit to 
baseball . While I doubt the league 
will ever truly be 'equal when the 
Yankees bring in over 12 times the 
Expos' revenue, this would be a big 
step toward equality. 

However, there is one reason I 
cannot support the decision: I do 
not believe it is fair to the fa ns of 
the MinnesOI> 1\vins for their team 
to get canned. 

Garrett Gentry's five goals. 
Kirchwehm added four goals while 
Barry pitched in with a pair. Junior 
goalie Doug Finfrock also helped 
out, making 13 saves in the winning 
effort. 

Vladimir Djapic led the Tritons 
with three goals. Jon Samuels had 
two goals while Hori, Brandon 
Borso, Jon Hopkins and Kevin 
Smoker each had a single score. 
Goalie Lance Onken had five saves 
for UCSD, which entered the game 
ranked No. 9 in the nation. 

The Twins have been around for 
years and, unlike the Montreal 
Expos, have built a definite fa!1 base 
and history. Sure, no one went to 
their games this year, but their sta-
dium was packed in the late 1980s 
and early 1990s when the Twins 
were con'sisteratly in the playoffs. In 
the last 15 years, only the Yankees 
have won more World 
Championships than the Twins. 

There are also the legendary 
players of the Twins. Kirby 
Puckett, Rod Carew and Harmon 
Killebrew set incredible records in 
Minnesota. T hey brought throngs 
of fans to the stadium. T hey built 
legends there. All that could be 
gone with the stroke of a pen. 

TIle more changes that baseball 
commissioner Bud Selig and the 
owners make to this game, which 
prides itself on durability and tradi-
tion, the more fans they lose. 

f think f can speak for fans 
across the nation when I say to the 
owners and Bud Selig: Shut up and 
just let the players play.

Women's soccer repeats as CCAA champs 
Tritons defeat Cal Poly Pomon~ for second-straight title 
By COREY HOLMAN 
Staff Writer 

The U CSD women's soccer 
tealll faced a familiar foe in the 
Californi a C ollegiate Athletic 
Associa tion championship game 
Sunday afte rnoon and came away 
with its second-consecutive con-
ference ritle . In its third meeting 
of the yea r, UCSD convincingly 
defeated Cal Poly Pomona 2-0 at 
TTlton Soccer Stadium. 

With the win, UCSD ·ensured 
a berth in [he 200 I NCAA 
DIvision fI Women 's Soccer 
' Iburnamenr, while inc reasing Its 
number of consecuti ve tourna -
mcnt appea rances to 16. 

Every match be twee n the e 
twO CCM powers has helped to 
fostc r a g rowing rivalry. Earlier 
In the season, UCSD pi cked up a 
crucia l 1- 0 away win when 
Anne-Ala r ie Mikl os scored with 
less than a 'econd le ft in the 
gamc. The Broncos returned the 
favor at Triton Soccer Stadium 
when LI sa Araujo scored the 
lone goa l, evening the season 
se ri es. 

While the first two games were 
hard-fought battles, the Tritons 
clearly dominated this contest. 

UCSD got on the board in the 
30th minute when Bronco defend-
er Kim Ackman deflected Julia 
Cuder's corner kick into her own 
net . Cuder's in-swinging cross 
fooled Ackman and the ball 
glanced off the side of Ackman's 
head past helpless Pomona goalie 
Katie Kreps. 

Kira Ackman nearly made up 
for her sister's mistake late in the 
first half. After a defensive scram-
ble in the box, the ball fell to an 
unmark'ed Kira Ackman inside the 
6-yard box. The resulting shot 
was goal-bound with Triton goalie 
Kami Poma tied up, but defender 
Molly Carlson was in the right 
position at the right time and 
cleared the ball off the line. 

UCSD started slowly in the 
second half and almost paid the 
price when Araujo's header in the 
S I st minute sailed inches over the 
crossbar. 

The near equalizer woke up 
the Triton offense, resulting in the 
game's second goal in the 72nd 

minute. Christine Wensel started 
the bui ldup when she made a run 
on the right flank. Kristen 
Conahan centered the ball, find-
ing Erika Alfredson .unmarked at 
the back post. Alfredson's initial 
header hit the post but she man-
aged to push the rebound into the 
net. 

UCSD held on during the last 
15 minutes of the game, securing 
the win. 

While the Triton offense 
deserves its share of the credit 
for the win, the defense and mid-
field were the reasons UCSD 
dominated this game so thor-
oughly. Pomona came into the 
CCAA tournament with CCAA 
South Division leading scorer 
Michelle McConnell and CCAA 
Freshman of the year Araujo 
leading its attack. UCSD's 
defense stepped up to the chal-
lenge, effectively shutting down 
the two most dangerous Pomona 
players. 

Carlson, in particular, did well 
to limit McConnell to one errant 
shot late in the second half. 
Furthermore, the Triton midfield

Davis last Friday that earned the Tritons a spot in Sunday's championship match. 

effectively controlled the flow of 
play for most of the game and lim-
ited the amount of work for the 
Triton backJine. 

UCSD heads into the NCAA 
Tournament as the No. 1 seed in 
the Far West region, receiving a 

bye in the first round of the 24-
team tournament. Up next for the 
Tritons will be either Cal State 
Dominguez Hills or Cal Poly 
Pomona. The game will be at 
Triton Soccer Stadium either 
Nov. 10 or Nov. 11.

The UCSD women's volley-
ball team picked the right time of 
yea r to catch fire . The Tritons, 
winning e ight of their last 10 
matche , continued their stellar 
pl ay with a 3-0 spanking of 20th-
ra nked C alifornia State 
Unive rsity Bakersfield on 
Tuesday afte rnoon at RIMAC 
Arena. 

The ga me was a crucial 
Ca li fo rn ia Collegiate Athletic 
Associarion march and made up 
for a ga me originally scheduled for 
Sept. 14 but postponed after the 
Sept. II tragedy. 

UCSD head coach Duncan 
McFarland was very pleased with 
the victory. . 

"This was a very big win for 
us," McFarland said. "This win 
does a lot for our confidence." 

UCSD, which improved to IS-
4 in the CCAA and 20-6 overall , 
ca me out blazing and set the tone 
of the match early. The Tritons 
laid the smack down on the 
'Runners with a convi ncing 30-20 
win in the opening game. 

Cal State Bakersfield, which 
fell to IS -S in the CCAA and 18-8 
overall, struggled throughout the 
match, allowing UCSD to falter in 
the second and third games but 
still prevail. 

"[The 'Runners] were off of 
thei r ga me," McFarland saId. 
"They made a lot morc errors than 
they typ ica lly do. It is usually 
[they] who are playi ng good vol-
leyba ll and putti ng pressure on 
other tca m~. " 

T he Tritons kept it togelher 
and fini shcd off the sweep with 30-
24 and 30-28 wins in the fin al two 
ga me, of thc match.

having trouble, we had problems 
maintaining our intensity," 
McFarland said . "We struggled in 
games two and three, but we were 
able to finish them off. That is a 
big confidence-booster for us to 
know that we can win against a 
good team even when we are not 
playing our best." 

UCSD freshman Stacy 
Dunsmore led tile team with a 
match-high 14 kills to go along 
with a tcam-high II digs. 

"[Dunsmore] has been playing 
very steady since our match 
against G rand Canyon," 
McFarland said. "She has been 
very solid." 

Teresa Ohta added a match-
high 39 assists in the win . 
Kathleen Hentz and Katie Hogan 
each had nine kills for the 
Tritons. 

Cal State Bakersfield was led by 
Jessica Slayton'S II kills and Lisa 
North's 3S assists. 

The win was crucial for 
UCSD's playoff future. The 
Tritons are attempting to continue 
their hot play and secure the sec-
ond seed in the regional tourna-
ment, which would give the team a 
first-round bye. 

" It looks like everyone on the 
team is starting to peak at the 
right time," McFarland said. "It's 
been a long season for us, but we 
are playing very well heading into 
the playoffs. I hope that we can 
keep this momentum into the 
playoffs. " 

UCSD's final games of the 
season will be home matches 
against UC Davis and Chico 
State. The Tritons will square off 
against the Aggies on ,Friday at 7 
p.m. before hosting the Wildcats

M ajor League Baseba II own-
ers convened 
Tuesday to discuss 
two baseball teams. 

The owners agreed that there 
needed to be changes with two 
teams - most likely beginning 
next season. Neither of these two 
teams are named the Yankees or the 
Diamondbacks. 

The two teams under scrutiny 
aren't the ones that bought the 
World Series this year, or the team 
that has bought it the past three 
years. The two teams the baseball 
owners talked about are the 
Montreal Expos and the Minnesota 
Twins. 

There has been much debate in 
the past year on eliminating two 
Major League Baseball teams, and 
last year the owners gave their offi-
cial agreement to do so before the 
2002 season. While no teams have 
officially been named, the consen-
sus is that the Twins and the Expos 
will get the boot. 

I must admit I'm of two minds 
about this proposed execution of 
two franchi ses. 

As a fan, I'm natura lly distrust-
ful of any move the owners agree 
to. I believe they are only con-
cerned with profit and that they 
would agree to something that was-
n't in the best interest of baseball if 
it would give them more money. 
This decision will do that. 

The revenue and broadcasting 
rights the two teams earn will go 
toward other teams to help them 
pay for new ballparks, new conces-
sions and new players.
