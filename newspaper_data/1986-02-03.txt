Reed students occupy office over divestment 
By NONIE GANAKIS 

O NE-TENTH OF THE student body o f Reed College in Portland , 
Oregon , blockadrd the collegc's 
mai n ad ministra tive complex on 
Jan. 25 as a protest against the 
College Board of Trustees' 
deCIsion nor to divest in 
companies wi th ties to South 
Africa. talements of support arc 
hei ng sought by mc "Occupants" 
lrom prominent organtzauons. 

At 5 pm on that day, Paul 
Bragdon, president of Reed 
College, announced to a room 
full of press members and 
spectators In Vollumm College 
Center, that the trustees would 
nm dive t. ChriS Phelps. a 
member o[ the campus anti -
apartheId group, the outh 
African Concerns Commmec 
( C), expressed dlcontent 
with the statement and declared , 
"I'm gOIng to Elhot Hall (th e 
admimstranon huikltng) and you 
are all tnv\(ed to JOin me," 
accordIng to Malt Carlson , a 
member of the SACC. "One 
hundred students filed into the 
hall and chains went on the 
doors," he sa id . 

The students prevented the 
admmlstra tl on trom entering the 
complex until Wednesday at 
10:30 when negotiations were 
fi nali zed . 

An estimated $6 to $8 million 
of Reed's investments are 
incorpo rated in companies that 
have Signed the Sullivan 
Principles I, but not Princi ples n, 

which call s fo r increased 
standard of good corporatc 
cit ize nsh ip, accord ing to a press 
release. 

SuppOrt and le tt ers of 
solidarity were received from 

supporters. Shokal said . Andy 
Howard , a member or the UCSD 
Free South Arnca Coali tion , 
responded to the Occupams ca ll 
fo r support by stating in a ietter. 
"Reed's Board of Trustees have 

In the months since the anti -
apal1hcid demonstrauon of 
spring 1985, an esumated 30 
universities across the country 
arc protesting by occupying 
structures on rhelr campuses. 

Students Jrom un iversities across the country demonstrate their support Jo r divestment Jrom South AJrica. 

UCSD, UCSB, UCB, as well as 
many prominent Ivy league 
univers ities, added Shokat. State 
representa tives, se nato rs , 
AFL/CIO and the American 
Committee o f South Africa were 
among the many prestigious 

made a conscious choice to 
support apan heid through 
continued investment 111 South 
Africa, and your vigorous 
respo nse to this c riminal act is 
" n Inspi ration to people of 
conscience everywhere." 

ThIS new awareness has evoked 
an influx of an estlmated 100 
new members to the UCSD 
Coalition , thought to be a result 
of Bishop Tutu's speech at UCSD 
on Jan . 23, said Howard. 

The protestors reae hed a 

compromise with Bragdon at 
10:30 am on Wednesday, lan, 
29, after 12 hours of night-long 
negotiations, said Shokat. 

"We now end the occupauon , 
confident that we arc closer to 
our fundamental goal of full 
dlvestmem," Shokar said, quoting 
from a press release that the 
SACC issued after the protest 
had terminated . 

Presidem Bragdo n expressed 
dlscontenr WIth the outcome of 
the protest in hIS official 
statement to the press. "During

The political vulnerability of the mass media 
By GALE DICK 

"The real threat to our. .. onstltutional system IS on 
our TV s reens evety evening and in the from pages of 
our newspapers ever morning." Senator Jesse Helms, 
apparently with grave sincerity, Issued this warning [0 
a Conservative Pohtical ACtIon Conferen e earlier last 
year. The ourcl! of this menace, he comended, "is 
men and women who, II the), don 't hate Amencan 
virtues, cenainly have a smug concept for Amencan 
Ideals and principles ." 

Helms was speaking, of our e, about the U news 
establishment, the perennial scapegoat of pollucal and 
bUSiness leaders soured by probing Journalism. But 
these folks needn't worry toO much any more ; like the 
rest of the nation, the press IS undergoing shifts In its 
political orientation. What Helms sees as a rabidly 
unpatriotic , leftist press is actually, ac ording to many 
media analyst , the nation 's seeing eye dog, toothless 
and nearsighted , loping happily off to the right after its 
new corporate and White House masters. 

"If you can find a liberal press in this countty, you 
deserve a obel pnze ," says Osborne Elliot, dean of 
Columbia University's journali sm depanmem and 
publisher of the Columbia journalism Rmcw. Recently, 
Elliot lamented the waning of "responSible, cmical, and 
compassionate journalIsm" and the adoption of a 
" are-free , countty club mentalIty" since the election of 
Ronald Reagan. A cording to Senior Ediwr of the New 
Republic Fred Barnes, the press' new ta k is largely a 
reOectlon of the mood of the natIOn. He said that 
Reagan 's Immense popularity was "bound to Infect the 
press eventually." ThiS "Zeitgeist," he said, shaped the 
"dramatic potential shifts" underway In the news 
media . 

The most oft- Ited example of the media dnft -
whal Barnes called "the press's new honeymoon with 
Reagan" - IS the increaSingly sympalhetlc coverage of 
Reagan's Central Amen an poliCies. Ben Bagdlklan, 
professor of Journalism at UC Berkeley said there has 
been an "enonnous acceptance of Reagan , as 
eVIdenced by the great reluctance towards cntl ai , 
Independent dlggmg on the pan of reporters covering 
Central Amenca." 

As a result, the White House has been able to shape 
the pOint of view reaching the public. Unquahfied 
reference to the Sandinistas in Nicaragua and the 
Salvadoran rebels as "communIst" or -Marxist-LeninIst" 
are now ommonplace. Todd Gitlin , a writer for The 
Na!lon magazine and professor of SOCiology at UC 
Berkeley said that parroting the administration rhetoric 
also filled media coverage of various recent Central 
American elections. When Reagan applauded EI 
Salvador's elections as "free" and denounced 
NICaragua's as "fraudulent," Gitlin said "reporters filed 
their stories like lemmIngs, Ignonng the fact that lIn EI 
Salvador] Il was illegal not to vote ." 

WhIle lar lrom Universal, the rightward march has 
included what were on e regarded a the standard 
bearers of the "IIheral" press. Both Gitlin and Barnes 
refer to the j ew Yorl! Times' emerging "neo-
conservatism" under executive editor Abraham 
Rosenthal. 'The paper's foreign news," said Barnes in a 
recent Nt'lv Rcpublic, "Often takes an anti-communist 
tack." In 1982, the TIII1CS withdrew Central American 
correspondent Raymond Bonner from the region . He 
had been strongly critical of the Reagan 
administration's POIiCICS, and the move was welcomed 
b)' both the admInistration and right-wing media 
critic 

Another example - much closer to home - is the 
TlIllcs' coverage of the student anti-apanheid 
movement at the Umversity 01 California. Gitlin said 
that Rosenthal "hates movements," and was only 
persuaded to cover the divestment sit-ins a month 
after they began. When the swty did appear, it 
focused on the "yuppification" of Berkeley's radical 
tradition , rather than what Gitlin sees as the 
movement's "broad coalition basis ." 

Ironically, Barnes' New Republic has also joined the 
fray. The magazine's cover for their "media 
realignment" issue depicted ABC, the Timcs, and other 
media giants as automobiles recklessly tUrning right, 
while the New RepubliC zoomed straight ahead. But 
even Barnes admits the graphic is misleading. The 
once progressive weeKly has gone me way ot me peers 
Il so readily ndicules. "I'm pretty conservative myself," 
Barnes said after applauding the ebb of the "knee-jerk 
liberal," "gloom and doom," "snobbish press 
establishment." 

But the so-called Reagan "revolution" IS not the only 
force behind the scenes of US news sources. The rise 
of the media as a lucrative cooperative business and 
shifting patterns of press ownershi p have also played 
their pan in the indusuy's ideological remodeling. 
mall , family-owned newspapers are vety rare these 

days Most have long since opened to the public as 
corporauons and have been purchased by one of the 
many huge press conglomerates such as Hearst, 

ewhouse and Gannen. In 1984, the 20 largest 
companies owned more than half of the nation's daily 
circulation , and the pace was quickening. The same 
trends - and many of the same com panies - have 
dominated the ownership of local teleVision stations. 

In addition to becommg more centralized, the media 
industry IS increasingly the territory of the cream of 
the US corporate elite . In 1979, ~ter Dreier and Steve 
Weinberg publIshed the results of a year-long study of 
press ownership in the Columbia Journalism Re\~ew. 
"The largest 25 newspapers," they wrote, "have well 
over 250 Interlocks (In which a director sits on twO or 
more boards of directors) with the Fortune 1300" -

an anuual listing of the nation's biggesl wrpora tions. 
This group, they continued, "is ovetwhelmlllgly white 
and male. and drawn from among the most pnvlledged 
members of sociery." 

Hodding Carter, columnist and erstwhile small-town 
paper owner, pointed out in a recent Wall Sireci journal 
that "editors, anchonnen Isic/. reporters, and 
publishers ... are the people who have made it in 
modern America - ostentatiously, gloriously, anu 
rewardingly - and they are not about to pla)1 Samson 
in the temple ." 

These trends are not new, nor IS therc any one-to-
one relalionship between corporate elite ownership 
and right-Wing news coverage. Both publishers and 
editors insist that they keep ownership and news 
strictly separate and with few exceptions this seems to 
be the case. "Newspapers and television stations have 
always been owned by people with large amounts of 
money," said Geoffrey Stokes, press columnist for the 
Village Voice. "There is no basis for the false historical 
romanticism surrounding the progressive press of days 
gone by," Stokes said . 

What is new is the accelerated pace and huge 
financial sums of recent mergers, and the visible 
rightward swing of both young and old news sources. 
This year has already seen a trebling of stock prices 
throughout the industty and the biggest deals in media 
histoty. In JanualY, Gannett Corporation - the 
publisher of USA Today - stunned the competition by 
paying $200 million for tlle highly regarded Des 
Moines, Iowa Register. Capital Cities Communications, 
In the biggest non-oil merger ever, paid $3.5 billion for 
ABC In March. 

In the same two-week period as the Capital Cities 
maneuver, Atlanta media maverick Ted Turner 
announced his Ill-fated $5.4 billion bid for CB , and 
Rupert Murdoch made the first of twO big fordYs into 
the teleVision industry by purchasing a 50 percent 
share of Twentieth Centuty Fox. Murdoch's second 
move came early in May, when at $2.8 billion he took 
over Metromedia, Inc., the nation'S largerst owner of 
independent Tv stations. 

Murdoch is an Australian citizen currently seeking 
US citizenship in order to carty OUt his dreams of a 
US media empire . He already owns 80 newspapers -
including the Chicago Sun-Times, the New York Post , 
and the Boston Herald - a handful of magazines and 
news syndicates, and a direct satellite broadcasting 
company. Famous for his personal views and tastes, 
Murdoch gears his papers towards the sensationalistic, 
popular appeal so prevalent in the New York Post and

Alcohol policy: a license for drunk driving 
By JANICE HAYWARD 

I T IS FRIDAY NIGHT ON the UCSD campus. Classes are finished until Monday 
and the students are ready for a 
weekend of socializing and 
relaxation. One would expect the 
campus to be alive with activity; 
however, this campus is baSically 
deserted . A few residents are 
spending a quiet evening 
watching Miami Vice, but the 
majority of the residents have 
Oed the campus. They have gone 
in search of a party with the 
presence of alcohol. Who is to 
guarantee that all of these 
students will return home safely? 

The newly instated alcohol 
policy prohibits the possession 
or comsumption of alcohol on 
campus. For obvious reasons, 
most students are outraged at 
this new restriction . However, 
the lack of campus parties and 
SOCializing is the least of my 
worries. This new policy has 
contributed to one very serious 
problem: drunk driving. 

The administration must 
realize that college students will 
be college students. An alcohol 
policy will not eliminate college 
students' desire for alcohol. 
Attending panies at the home of 
off-campus residents or on the 
an Diego State campus has 

become the new trend. 
Additionally, more and more 
students are caravanning down 
to Tijuana to drink, dance and 
release the week's tensions. 
Tijuana is at least a 4O-m~nute 
drive from UCSD, and after a 
couple of extremely potent 

drinks, few oeople , if any, leave 
Tijuana sober. A fatality due to 
drunk driving seems inevitable. 

Many students will drive to 
Tijuana or off-campus panies 
with or without an alcohol 
policy, but allowing alcohol on 
campus would definitely increase 
the attraction of socializing on-
campus. Sadly enough, Sludents 
are going to where the alcohol is 
present. 

One rather odd twist to this 
stringent alcohol policy, is the 
continued serving of alcohol at 
the Triton Pub and the TGIF 
parties. Many students who visit 
the pub or the TGIF parties are 
commuter students, as these 
locations oITer the only real 
means of socializing outside of 
the classroom. These students 
then drive themselves home -
intoxicated. Students who attend 
on-campus parties on Friday and 
Saturday nights tend to live on 
campus and merely have to walk 
back to their apartment or dorm. 
Drunk driving is infinitely more 
dangerous than drunk walking. 

Simply suggest ing that the 
alcohol policy be eliminated is a 
rather foolish solution. Drunk 
driVing would still be a problem, 
and the alcohol related problems 
that the university is ttying to 
eliminate would once again be 
present. The one solution which 
appears to be feasible requires a 
compromise. First of all, alcohol 
should be removed from the pub 
and TGIF parries. This action in 
itself would eliminate many 
"happy hour" drivers. Many

students will oppose this action; 
however, after livi ng on an 
otherwise "dry" campus, I think 
the com plaint will be minimal. 
Students would rather drink 
whenever or wherever they 
please as opposed to being 
confined to two locations. 

The alcohol policy, to a certain 
extent, should be cast aside; 
however, some new rules should 
be instated . If a resident desires 
to host a parry, he or she must 
get the consenr of the dean. This 
consent would be easy to acquire 
as long as they did not have any 
previous Ollenses relaleo to a 
party (damage to a dorm or 
other campus property). If such 
an incident occurred, the 
resident would be forbidden to 
host a party for the remainder of 
thf> Quarter. A second violation 
would result in a serious 
reprimand, such as loss of his or 

her housing contract. Once 
again, students may protest this 
restriction , yet I am sure they 
would be willing to abide by it if 
it meant they could serve alcohol 
at their party. 

Donn parties, in which the 
entire Ooor or hall is involved, 
would also need to be approved 
by the dean. A couple of security 
officers could patrol the area 
around the dorm building in 
order to prevent propeny 
damage or other disturbances. 
These security officers would not 
be concerned with noise or (he 
presence of alcohol. 

Now for the problem of drunk 
driving. I sugge:;t that UCSD hire 
additional security officers to 
patrol the parkmg lots on the 
wef'kends. ThiS add ilion or 
employees could be funded by 
the money saved from bu)ing 
beer for the TGIF parries dna 

from staffing the Triton Pub. 
When the students return to 
their cars, intoxicated , the 
security officers would offer them 
the ultimatum of receiving a 
drunk driving violation or 
finding a sober friend to 
tra,nsport them home. Cars 
leavi ng the campus on Friday 
dud Saturday nights would be 
under close surveillance. Students 
may argue (hat this is an 
invasion of privacy; however, 
with the present also hoi policy, 
the resident dean can enter a 
dorm or apartment with the 
suspicion that alcohol is present. 
This such action seems to be a 
more severe form of invasion of 
privacy. 

I realize the univeristy created 
the alcohol policy for the 
students' protection, and I am 
sure we have a much more 
"controlled" campus than we 
have had in past years. 
Unfortunately, alcohol 
consumption IS always going to 
be a problem, but prohibiting 
alcohol completely only causes 
the students to r2bel. Alcohol on 
campus may lead to some 
disruptive problems, but alcohol 
off-campus may lead to InJunes, 
even fatalities, due to drunk 
drivmg. 

There is no guarantee that the 
students will not rebel against my 
proposal. However, the students 
at UCSD are so strongly opposed 
to the present alcohol policy that 
I am sure they would be willing 
to work with the administration 
in this compromlSC. ~

they have caminued to allow

shown no signs of end1l1g their 
practices of torture, kidnapping 
and committing Other atrocities 

Beyond these facts , thiS would 
be a panicularly 1I10pportune 
time to increase the level of 
co nflict in Central America. On 
January 11 and l2 of thiS year, 
the foreign mintster~ of the

the problems of Central America 
They issued as statemem which 
called for, among other request , 
"a tennination of external 
support to thc irregular for es 
operating in the region ." This is 
a dear referrnce to the need for 
the Ul1Ited tates to drop its 
support for the contras. The 
Contadora Group is madc up of 
eight major Latin American 
democracies which we consider

Thc cndorsemcnt of the

development 111 the search for 
peace In Central America. To' 
increase mihmT}' aid at a time 
when these nations are working 
for a peaceful solution would be 
an insult to their effons. 

I propose that the $100 
million which the Adm1l1istratlon 
intends to spend on military aid 
to destabilize the Nicaraguan 
government could be much more 
effectively spent in Central 
America. At a time when we are 
cutting spending on some of our 
most constructive efforts in Latin 
America, we should not increase 
funding for military aid to the 
contr.ts. One hundred million 
dollars co uld very wisely and 
effectively be spent on 
development programs that are 
necessary to the survival of our

I request that you review your

The responsibility of the 
publisher, as Murdoch sces it, is 
"not only to inform but to make 
the newspaper so attractive that 
it appeals to as many people as 
pOSSible," he told the Chmlian 
Science Monitor last year. 
Appealing or not, Murdoch's 
approach - except In the case 
of the Post - is cenainly 
profimble; most of his 
publications reap large profits 
and extend their circulation. But 
it has also earned him some 
enemies. Behind his status as 
media monarch lies a trail of 
embittered fonner staff members, 
such as well-known columnist 
Mike Royko, fonnerly of thc 
Chicago Sun· Times, who resigned 
when Murdoch took over the 
paper last year. 

While Murdoch, along with 
William Randolf Hearst and S.l. 
Newhouse, typifies the old guard 
media magnate - imposing and 
individualistic - the latest 
round of mergers have 
introduced a whole new cast of 
characters with a variety of roles 
and motives. Witness Jesse 
Helms and his organization 
Fairness in Media (FIM) urging 
conservatives - amid laments of 
patriotism and charges that CBS 
is "the most anti-Reagan 
network" - to buy stock 111 the 
corporation in order "to become 
Dan Rather'S boss." 

What irks Helms, according to 
Bagdikian, is the fact that CBS is 
"the most professional ne(Work 

news organization," and "the 
only one wilhng to go beyond 
the White House rhetoric in its 
coverage." It was, in fact, CBS's 
prestige which attracted Ted 
Turner, owner of Cable News 
Network and Turner 
Broadcasting systems. Helms and 
Turner met to discuss options for 
a takeover JUSt before Turner 
announced his bid for CBS. 
While it is unclear how closely 
linked their efforts are, it is 
certain that both would like to 
see a substantial right-ward turn 
in CBS' news programs. 

Neither effort ever worned 
CBS managcrs too much. Helms 
has been blocked by CBS' refusal 
to release a list of stockholders to 
be suhje ted to FlM's 10bbyll1g. 
Turner, meanwhile, appears 
never to have had the cash now 
to win the ne(Work and mainmin 
it. 
Nevertheless, the possiblity ot 
someone else taking over CBS is 
still very much alive . "Whenever 
a company is mentioned as for 
sale," StOkes said, "it eventually 
gets bought." CBS is apparently 
soliciting candidates such as 
General Electric for a "friendly 
takeover" similar to the Capital 
Cities/ ABC merger. 

Not everyone views the 
changes at the top of ABC as 
entirely friendly, however. 
Capital Cities is on the AFL-
CIO's "Dishonor Role of Labor

corporation's board of directors , 
and stiH owns one to (Wo 
percent of its shares. If tI1e 
takeover is unlikely to strongly 
alTect the network's political 
orientations, it is only because 
ABC is already, in Barnes' words, 
"the straightest and most myopic 
conservative network." The lone 
comentator on the evening news 
program, for example, is hard-
line rightist George F. Will , who 
boasted on the air in March that 
he is "the only person regularly 
on network television who voted 
for Barry Goldwater in 1964 . 

Rivaling ABC for the right-
wing title may be Turner's CNN, 

Barnes characterizes the 
network's emphaSiS on economic 
issues as "supponive of 
unfettered capitalism." 

Thus far, CNN's formula seems 
to be a success. Created in 1980 
it now brings 24-hour news to 
29 million subscribers. CNN's 
growth stems from its appeal to 
an increasingly conservative 
public and from the nation 's 
growing reliance on television as 
its sole news source. In reference 
to these trends, StOkes pOinted 
out that teleVIsion coverage is 
generally less In depth and more 
easily limited to the White 
House's preferred Visual Images 

the newsviewing public has also 
rubbed off OntO newspaper 
fonnats, such as Gannert's USA 
Today. On the front page of its 
first issue , USA Today -
derisively as "USA Okay," 
"McPaper," or "the nation's 
nicepaper" - described an 
airline accident in its headline as 
"Mira le -327 survive , 55 die." 

ews appears in its briefest and 
brightest form , and the paper's 
coverage is strongly patriotic and 
supportive of Reagan 's foreign 
and economic policies. During 
the summcr Olympics, the paper 
openly cheered for US athletes 
competing for gold medals . In 
spi te of continuous operating 
losses and early skeptiCism of 
the paper's chances for survival, 
USA Today has managed to boost 
circulation to 1.4 millIOn daily 
readers in Just three years -
largely wirh the help of vending 
boxes designed to look like 
television sets. 

The paper's success contains 
all the elements of tI1e press' 
rightward drift in recent years. 
USA Today epitomizes both the 
"country club mentality" of a 
lucrative business catering to a 
conservative population, and the 
unquestioning projection of 
Reagan's world-view ontO news 
coverage by a right wing media. 
If the trend continues, as it 
shows every sign of doing, the 
burden of viewing world events 
critically and responsibly will 
shift enmely to the consumers 
ratber than the producers of 
news. ~

and Tokens" and "Attention and 
Perception ." 

In Attention and Perception, 
reaction time is measured as the 
subject attempts to push the 
right buttons to the right 
response on a computer 
keyboard. Dave Krajicek is a 
teacher's assistant running part 
of the experiment for Dr. Jeff 
Miller. Krajicek finds that 
ahhough a subject can get more 
out of it than class credll, "We 
try and debrief them to make 
sure they've learned somethll1g." 
Graduate student Lehman 
Benson adds that many students 
"get thel r hour in and leave as 
soon as it's over. But most of 
them do want to know what it 's 
all about." 

What the less caring subjects 
m.ss is that their parti ipatior 
v.iU be part of a final study to be 
published to prove or disprove a 
hypothesis. At the very least Ihey 
are hitting buttons on a 
keyboard. At the most they are 
involved in changing a current of 
psychological thought and 
theory. And getting credit for it. 

Benson and Krajicek agree 
that taking an active interest in 
an experiment is to the benefit 
of the subject. They cite an 
example of an experiment 
(which did not occur at UCSD) 
that on closer examination was 
an attempt to suppOrt a theory 
claiming inferioriry in the 
intelligence of blacks. It 's 
mandatory at UCSD that all 
subjects be told what the 
hypothesis of the experiment is .~ these tiny ads on bullenn boards

approxiamtely 1500 ongoing

about 125 involve the social

another, from the buying of a

a new drug on a cancer patient 
at the VA Hospital. No matter

The bearded face looming 

from the video monitor was 
Orson Welles, all right, but the 
voice .didn't quite ring true as he 
introduced 'The Case Against 
Rick Lacher, Intern " Among 
Olher crimes, Welles accused Rick 
of "bad jokes." He backed up the 
accusations by showing clips or 
Rick playing a suspicious-looking 
character In a skit on The Larry 
Himmel Show, followed by a 
taped segment of "San Diego at 
Large" cast members doing a 
joke written by Lacher then later, 
with a scene from "Elmo Lincoln, 
Space Cadet," an independently 
produced series made by Lacher 
and a friend . Even Nancy Reagan 
got imo the act - condemning 
Lacher in a voice thai: sounded 
like Donald Duck Rick La her 
was found gUIlty of his CrImes 

The tongue -In-cheek videotape 
was pan of a project genCr'ltC0 
by La her's Intemship With "San 
Diego at ulrge" - The Larry 
Himmel Show, a comedy show 
on KFMB. La her, a media 
productions major, interned with 
the show last fall and is 

continuing there this quarter, 
through the Academic Internship 
Program (AlP). 

AlP and the other campus 
internship office, Associated 
Studems Internship Office 
(ASIO), offer UCSD students the 
opportunity to do supervised 
professional work in a wide 
variety of fields out in "the real 
world," as many of the interns 
PUt it. 

As the name implies, AlP 
offers academic credit toward 
upper division electives for 
internships arranged through 
that office . Applicants must have 
at least a 2.5 GPA and a 
minimum of 90 units. ASIO, the 
student-run internship office, 
docs not offer credIt and has no 
prerequlsHies for applicauons; 
any UCSD student may apply, 
although ce rtain internships may 
have more stringent 
reqUIrements. 

No matter which office they 
choo e, most studems sayan 
Internship is a real chaUenge.

il'ith wlde-rangll1g problems on 
thc Job - problcms from 
procuring a pair of whoopll1g 
mmes to dealing diplomatically 
with a potentially embarrassing 
conrrontation WIth human 
excrement. If there were any 
bori ng moments, these have 
been buried beneath the 
enthusiasm with which the 
II1terns talk about their jobs. 

An internship is what you 
make it, according to many of 
the students who've been 
through the process. Adam 
Grant, national program director 
of the ASIO says, "A lot depends 
on the intern. If they take it 
upon themselves that this is their 
chance - show initiative, ask 
que tions - they'll have a good 
experience." Grant thmks doing 
an internship "says something 
about a person who's willing to 
work without pay - r(.'.it they 
realize the rewards are nOt all 
monetary, that there 's somethll1g 
II1trinslcally valuable In the 
experience." 

Cynthia Collins, who interned 
at the Gaslamp Quarter Council 
through AlP, says she was 
pleased wllh the level of 
professionaUsm in the work ·she 
did there . But she says she can 
see how someone might get 
stuck doing work they didn't 
want to be doing. In that case, 
she suggests, you might have to 
assert yourself. She says, "The 
AlP office is clear about saying 
that this is professional 
experience, that you're not there 
to do clerical work." And she 
adds that AlP makes it evident 
they would not hesitate to back 
people up who are having those 
kinds of problems. Betty Fraser. 
program representative of AlP 
confirms this, saying that while 
some clerical work mIght be an 
unavoidable pan of the Job, It 
should be only a very small part. 

Far from being treated as a hired 
hand , Maria Gonzales, a pre-law 
student who interned with the 
Defenders Program of San DIego, 
Inc., had the opposite 
experience: she was treated as a 
peer by the anorneys in her 
office, and even by a courtroom 
judge once. "I was very 
professional," she says, "I wore 
suits , I carried a briefcase. I really 
got into it, right down to 
sneering at the prosecution ." 
One day in the courtroom, the 
judge addressed Gonzales with a 
question about the client. She 
says the whole courtroom started 
laughing when she replied, "Are 
you talking to me?" the judge 
said , "Yes, you are the counselor 
for thIS defendant?" And Maria 
answered, "Oh, no, ma'am. I'm 
just a law clerk." 

Maria is 32, about 10 years 
older than the rypical student 
imcrn , and she reels this was an 
advantage in her internship. 
Also, because the attorney she 
worked with is both visually 
impaired and extremely busy ( a 
small case load there is haVing 
about 25 cases going on at the 
same time), she "was asked to do 
a lot of things that an at/omey 
would normally do," such as 
interviewing clients and assisting 
in the courtroom. She says the 
office asked her to come back, 
and she wams to do so. "I know 
people now; I met some Judges 
and made a lot of contacts, so it 
would be easy for me to work 
there again ." 

While many students choosc 
internships directly related (0 
t1lC1r majors, others may decide 
to explore a completely differem 
field , or find a Job doing Ihe 

writing, editing and mher PR-
typc Ihmgs." 

Others, like Rick Lacher and 
Cynthia Collins, cxtend their 
internships past the first quarter. 
Lachcr says, "I'm interested in 
humor In all liS different forms. 
and (the "San Diego at Large" 
show) IS prctty mu h thc only 

finge rs. "LJi<t' that." 
And, aftcr spending two 

quarters With the Gaslamp 
Quarter Council , Collins has 
another proposal before them 
now - this time to do paid 
work. Although she also did 
other staff work, her maIn

him confidence that he could do

to the theory involved in

another intern hip, he says he 
would choose another field -
perhaps computer graphics. 

leA lot depends on the intern. If they 
take it upon themselves that this is their 
chance-show initiative, ask questions-
they'll have a good experience." 

For Adam Grant, "there's no 
replacement for actually getting 
on the bike and riding." Gram, a 
political science major, interned 
through ASIO last summer in the

Conrinued from page 11 
internship in the Washington 
office of Rep. Mac Sweeney (D-
Texas). She says, "I felt like I 
went to Texas instead of to 
Washington , because I became 
totally immersed in a completely 
di fferent part of the United 
States." When the Texans teased 
her about being a southern 
Californ ia girl, Eagle started 

mimicki n~ their accents . Then it 
was explici tly encouraged by 
the congressman, she says. He 
thought that whethe r they talked 
to a "yankee" or a Texan made a 
difference to constituents who 
phoned the office. Eagle quickly 
took on considerable 
responSibility in the office; she 
became head intern in her third 
week on the JOb, a d Uty mat 
meant keeping track of all the 
other interns. 

One of her most unusual 
accomplishments was getting a 
pai r of whooping cranes for the 
zoo in Victoria, Texas. The zoo 
had been trying to get some 
special exhibits to attract more 
people, and they thought 
whooping cranes might do the 
trick. Only about 90 of the long-
legged birds still exist, located in 
the United States Whooping 
Crane Reserve in Aransas Pass, 
Texas. But the zoo tried working 
directly through the reserve 
without success, so they called 
the ongressman's offIce. 
Through a complicated process 
of phone calls and favors owed, 
Eagle and another i ntem 
managed to get an extended loan 
of a pair of cranes. 

An ~xciting part of Cynthia 
Collins' job was giving tours of 
the Gaslamp Quarter to special 
groups, such as the State Historic 
Research Committee or local 
univerSity groups. he enjoyed 
"explam i ng the process of 
redevelopment in the Gaslamp to 
people who were not famihar 
with it, but who had a baSIC 
interest in historic preservation 
- wat hing their Interest grow, 
while I helped that happen ." 

On such a tour, one day she 
had Just finished a diSCUSSion 
about the homeless downtown 
- how It IS a problem [or which 
the people of San Diego arc 
reaUy reaching for solutions. She 
had the key to one of the 
refurbished historic buildings, 
and as she approached the door 
With key in hand , she looked 
straIght down. There , right in 
front of her, was evidence that 
someone had defecated on the 
sidewalk. Faced with a SItuation 
that would have nustered most 
people, Colhns remained poised 
and III control. he calmly turned 
around to face her group and 
said , "ThiS is a really good lime 
to talk about the location of 
public restrooms downtown. It's 
been:l o ntroversial issue, and I 
Just want to S.IY, thiS IS reahty -
thiS I, what's happening on the 
streets." 

Cynthia atlilbutes much of the 
confidence and pOise she 
exh ibited on lhe Job to her

I W T TO KNOW who was the fIrSt to deCide thar shoes should be a fashion itrnl . In 
{,lei, I want to know who was the 
firsl to deCide that shoes should 
be an Item at all. 

Lame deci IOn . 
Lalely I've been around a lot of 

people who are having foot 
problems. Bad foot problems. 
Let's-go-see-the-doctor kind of 
foot problems. They spend eight 
to 16 hours a day on their feet. 
and they pay for it dearly - and 
so does anyone within ten 
meters of them when they take 
those shoes off at the end of the 
day. Why do these people 
subject L~emselves to this? Why 
do these people subject others to 
this? Why don't they JUSt take 
their damn shoes off and go 
naturalle? 

Why indeed. I'll tell you why. 
Because it's un cool. Ours is a 
cool society. Don't be uncool. 

I just read an article that 
mentioned a study that found 
that the one billion people in the 
world from primitive cultures 
where foorwear isn't worn have 
very few foor problems at aU, 
rocks and sticks and broken 
coke bottles norwithstanding. Of 
course , we know these people 
are barbarians. Being the 
cultured , sophisticated, 
intellectually superior citizenry 
we know we are, we realize that 
the only rational thing to do is to 
go through each day in agony by 
surrounding our feet with 
peculiar objects that either cut 
off all circulation and ventilation 
or else hopelessly eonton the 
natural shape of the foor that 
God in HIS or Her or Its Infinite 
wisdom decided looked pretty 
on us. 

The people who suffer the 

thg wrifgr'g 0 

The shoe: friend or foe? 
most from our cultural superiority 
are women. Men don't have it so 
bad. Their shoes are fairly 
uncomplicated. and fairly 
standard. Men can get athletic 
shoes, dress shoes. or semi-
dress-but-nOl-reaUy shoes. Those 
are the options. I like tennis 
shoes. Tennis shoes are always 
comfortable .. Righl now I have 
my first pair of Converse All 
Stars on . Nice shoes (on sale for 
$26 at Sears during December -
you may have heard about 
them), except JUSt now I took 
one off because the rim was 
digging into my ankle and 
plssing me off. Did I say all 
tennis shoes are comfortable? 

All in all, men have it easy. 
Women, though , are a different

subject. BUI most of you knew 
thaI already. 

First of all , most women know 
that their shoes were invented by 
men, are designed almost 
exclusively by men. and are worn 
almost exclusively by women. 
This was man's way of 
subjugating his woman - give 
them something ludicrou~ to put 
on their feet and teU them. 
'Those are so attractive and they 
look so darlIng on you dear and 
yes, please please keep wearing 
them, don't ever take them off." 

For some reason women put 
up with that crap. Beats me why. 

Let's be honest. Women's 
shoes arc garbage. Ol [he tennis 
shoes - those are copies of [he 
men's shoes, and they're just 

fine. But when you start getting 
into heels, you're in trouble. How 
do you women walk with your 
feet pointed downward at angles 
up to 70"? Amazing! Also, what 
the hell is the point of skinny 
shoes? Do designers believe that 
all women wear size 6 Jouble-A? 
Some people - and I'm not 
ashamed to admil this - do 
have wide feet. Even some 
women! Yes! It'S true! And why 
do women's shoes come to a 
point? Do you have pointed feet] 
Does the person on your left 
have pointed feet? How about on 
your right? 

So most women pm their 
geneticaUy ~ealthy leet into 
pieces of leather or vinyl that 
completely mangle them.

FEATURES 

Remember hearing a salesperson 
say that, even though the shoes 
didn't seem comfortable now, 
wait a while and they'd feel just 
fme? "JUSt let them 'break in' for 
a while, you'll see ." Problem is, 
It'S your feet, nor the shoes, that 
do the "breaking in ." Sure, shoes 
do become a little less stiff. but 
that article I mentioned noted 
that if a shoe Isn't comfortable to 
start with, it isn't going to get 
any more comfortable later; your 
foot does all the adjusti ng, and 
you're going to end up paying 
for it m the long run , buddy. 

Also, I don 't know how you 
women pick your shoes. Women 
have 30 times the options of 
men, which makes buying shoes 
30 times the already-considerable 
nightmare that men have to deal 
with. "No, that doesn't quite feel 
right, can I try that one in a size 
7? . . , No, that color looks wrong 
on me; do you have this one in 
black? .. 0 , that stiU isn't right 
- how about that grey number 
in the window in a 7? . . No, 
sorry, well, thanks for your time 
Yes, I know you work on a 
commission. Of course I know 
your nme is valuable. Yes, I do 
know it's hard to make a living 
watching people stick their 
smelly feet into 300 pairs of 
shoes each day. You should have 
thought of that when you 
applied for this Job. ow Will you 
please get the hell off of me?" 

Despite aU the hassles, there 
are plenty of women out there 
with closets full of shoes, the 
results of hundreds of hours of 
shopping and even more time 
spent hanng life while standing 
m their selections. 
Congratulations, ladies, and for 
your sake I hope you're aU 
remcarnated as African 
Bushmen. I hope I am , too. ~

Men upset Westmont 
By GUSTAVO SANTOYO, Conmbutmg Eduor 

I T WAS THE KIND OF H01 [hat gives coaches carchac arrest. But when it went m, 
UCSO coach Tom Marshall did 
not need CPR. 

"Boy, did we need [hat," 
exclaimed a relieved Marshall 
after freshman for.vard Mark 
Sutherlin's whirlybird bank shot 
with six seconds left in overtime 
gave the Tntons a 68-66 upset 
vICtory over We [mont College 
before a small, but vociferous 
crowd at Triton PaVIllion . "A wm 
like th is IS important because it 
was agamst a team we weren 't 
supposed to beat, so maybe It'll 
give us some creedence and get 
us invlted to the eM 
tournament this year" saId 
Marshall. 

Sutherlin's shot was the 
crowning moment in a game that 
had more ups and downs than a 
an FranCIS 0 surface street. The 

full coun press employed by 
UCSO forced Westmont into a 
panic, which boo ted the Tmons 
to a 42-32 lead . But pinpoint 
outside hooting and a 
breakdown I the UC D press 
allowed the Hoyas to tie the 
score at 56. 

UC D guard Greg Kamansky 
put on a shoon ng c1i n I , 
shooting bombs from different 
area codes and tallymg a game 
high, 28 points. "He was 
unconscious," said Marshall , "it 
kept us in the game." With 
Westmont leading 60-58, Andy 
jedynak, almost stepping Out of 

bounds to grab a rebound , pased 
off to Kamansky who blew by the 
Westmont defense 10 tic the 
score. UCSD had one last chance 
10 win , but Hoya cemer Shawn 
turdeman blocked BIll Reese's 

baseline shot at the buzzer to 
force the game IntO ove rtime . 

The key pia}' In overtime was 
UCSO'~ smothering defense 
forci ng a nve-second caU. It gave 
the TritOns the ball and led to 
utherlin 's herOICS. 
Westmom coach Chet 

Kammerer was sull VIsibly up et 
with his team after the game. 
"UC 0 JUSt plain out hustled , 
outclassed and outsmarted us 
toJ1\ght. They were a lot hungrier 
than we were." @) 

Power brigade brings boollling 
bats to plate in 1986 
By GUSTAVO SANTOYO. Contributing Editor 
, Baseball becol1le~ dull only to dull thrashll1!(. 
minds." "We don't want to play 

-Red Snlllh anymore," the bullies would 
Once upon a mne, 111 the 

mounta1l1ous recesses beyond 
Warren College, there was a 
saawrl) , unhealth) baseball tcam. 

Every once 111 a w/llle, the) 
would che OUf a wm; nut more 
oftcn than 110t, bIg, bullYlllg JWlwr 
colleges and DIVISIon III Ichonls 
would go mer and sltamejully beat 
them up. 

"Har, Har, Har.'" the bulltes 
would roar. "You call YO llrselves a 
colleguue baseball team? Hah! 
There 's better competItIOn In the 
Amencan LegIOn." 

It was not a pretty SIght . Slch 
and tIred of the taunts and Jeers, 
the weak team was detemllned to 
get beuer. 

A nice coach from Oregon came 
over LO help out. "Work hard, be 
palienl, and things will get berrer," 
he told lhe team . 

They worned very hard. They 
practiced hitting. fielding and 
pitching. Some new players )Dilled 
the learn to help out . They ran and 
lifted weIghts. After a couple of 
years, that scrawny lillie team was 
now healthy and robust. 

"LeI's get those bullies!" the 
Lc:alll would yell, and lhey would 
proceed 10 gIve the bu/hes a sound 

whimper as they s umed bacll LO 
thm tmy little colleges. "We 'll go 
bear up on Cal Tech .. 

T HIS RAGS-TO-R1CHES fable may be a shgh t overslmphficatlon of 
the UCSD baseball saga, but not 
by much The talent on the 1986 
Tmons has Illsplred ~u h fear III 
some OI\'lson III schools that 
Lyle Yates, the nice coach from 
Oregon , has had to face some 
scheduling dIfficulties. 
Nevertheless, It'S only a shght 
blemish on what Yates forsees as 
a potennally successful team 

-ThiS is beyond a doubt the 
best team we ha\'e eve r put on 
the field ." 

After looking at the lIneup, 
one could do little to argue. 
Consider the facts: 

- Seven our of the eIght set 
fielding posltions are returning 
starters, and first baseman Brian 
Rude is an all-league transfer 
from Westmont College. A total 
of 12 players are returning from 
last year's squad . 

- Three team MVP's - Dan 
Peterse n ( J 983), Bob Natal 
(1984) and David Stano"lch 
(1985) are all in the starling 

lineup. 
atal, Petersen and third 

baseman Derek A1konis were all 
district ballplayers when UCSD 
was a member of the AlA. Rude 
was an all-district player thaI 
same year for Westmont 

Add 10 these ImpressIve 
credennals a deep pHchlllg staff 
and it's no wonder Cal Tech 
refuses [Q play the Tritons. 

"We have several qualIty 
players who -:an play va rious 
poslllons." sa id Yates. "so we 
never have a gaping hole in our 
hneup. We're just a real good 
veteran ball lub." 

You won 't see Gene Mauch 
"Lmleball" on this team. This hall 
club features an elemem thaI 
may have opposi ng pitchers 
running lor the dugout: Power. 

"Our strenghth IS in our 
offense ," said Yatwes. "We have 
the capability of scoring runs III 
bunches. There arc a lot of guys 
on our team that can hun you 
wilh one swing." 

Leading the power bngade is 
Bob Natal , a junior catcher who 
holds the UCSD career home run 
record with 20 roundtrippers -
an impressive feat considering 
that the dimenSIons of UCSO's 
ballpark, Olsen FIl'ld . are bigger 
than those of many malor league

Women maim Mills, 
lose by 2 to CSUSB 
By FLIP HARRISON, Sraff Wrire, 

GOOD NEWS CAME TO the Triton women's basketball team in 
their th rashing of Mills College Fri-
day night by a score of 82-26. The 
bad news came the next night, 
however, whe n UCSD lost a 
tough game to CSU San 
Bernardino 58-56. 

In the Mills College game, the 
Tritons never looked back after 
scoring the fi rs t bucket of the 
game. By hal ft ime the team was 
leading by 36 and Mills College 
was ready to head for the bus. 
Mills made the mistake of 
m ming back for the second hall , 
however and ended up losing by 
56. 

UCSD was led 111 sconng by 
HeIdI jungltng's 20 pomts. 111

I J .Ind had 12 rebounds while 
Kim tonel'lpher hit for 8 .lI1d .

The game wa~ not expected to 
be d barn burner. "We knew we

short by 2 at the sound of the

tra iling by as many as 10 in the 
early pan of the game, the team 
made San Bernardino work for 
their Vtctory. ' We never quit , we 
were fighting until the end ,"said 
coach Malone, "and any coach 
likes to see their team do that." 

The Tritons' poor shooting is 
what COSt them the game. Shelli 
Velie and Sand y Keaton had 
l.mc harac teristieaily bad nights 
wi th 2 fo r 13 and 2 for 11 
shooling performances, 
respectively As a team UCSD 
shot 26 percent in the firs t hair. 
31 perce nt for the game. 

Highpoims in the game came 
from team star HeidI jungli ng 
who had l-t pOlms and 12 
rebounds. A good cfTort also 
came from Chris McCallum whe 
popped for l2 and had eight 
boards. In addi llon , Lynne

Unfortunately for the U D

competing with them this year as 
preparation for the Olympics will 
force Ron to take time off from 
his college career. Last year, Ron 
and fellow sailor Ken Redler led 
UC D to a second place finish 
In the Douglas Cup in Long

represents the U. . ollegiate
