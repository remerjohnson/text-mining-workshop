effective spring 2003, student fees 
had not been raised since 1994. 

One-third of the increase will 
be funneled directly to financial 
.lId, UC spokesperson Brad 
Ilayward said . The Board of 
RegelHs insttruted the policy of 
returning one-third of all fee 
increases to financial aid in the 
early 1990 , when California uf-
fe red another economic down-
nlrn . Hayward said the money 
allocated to financial aid should 
allow studems from all finanCial 
backgrounds to attend the univer-
sity in light of the fee hikes. 

"I t~ obviously very IInporrant 
for the university to remain acces-
sible to lower-income srude,ptS," 
Hayward aid. "Between the 
increased financial aid offered by 
UC and the governor's proposal t~ 
increase funding to Cal-Grants, 

studentS getting financial3ld grants 
should es entially be covered." 

According to the univerSity, 
Davis' new budget proposal fur-
thers the University of California's 
funding shortfa ll to almost $1 bil-
lion, where over $500 billion has 
been slashed from funding and 
another $400 million-plus in 
tate-university partnership fund-

ing of staff and faculty pay increas-
es has been forgone since 200 1-
02. Budget analysts for thc 
Univer ity of California say the 
fee increase will net an extra 179 
million this year and next, cover-
mg less than 19 percent of the uni-
versity's tOtal budget shortfall. 

Other departments affected by 
Davis' most recent round of cuts 
include a $36.5 million reduCtlon

New approach helps find 
water pollution causes 
An innovative approach for beach side 

communities to pinpoint the causes of 
water pollution has been provided by a UC 
Irvme-Ied study. 

The study reveals that It's pOSSible to 
Identify and track the speCifiC sources of 
water pollution by combining badena sam-
pling With geiletlC testing. The research 
team used thiS technique while studYing 
the causes of beach pollution In Avalon, 
Catalina Island - a popular tourist destina-
tion for s\NImmlng and recreational boating. 
By combining these methods, the 
researche rs found Ihal decaYing sewage 
pipes In he downtown area adjacent 10 
Avalon Bay had been lea Ing human waste 
Into he shoreline wa er. 

As a result of thiS research, Avalon offi-
CIals shplined he CI 's sewer lines to seal 
he leaks and are currently investigating 

conne Ing pipeS from pnva e bUSinesses 
and homes for urther lea age. Their work 
has already decreased bac ena levels along 
he shoreline by more han 50 percent, and 

beach closures declined froIT" 3 1 In 2001 0

en IStS have advanced ne e ort olden Ify 
the genes Involved In human male Infert ili-

and may prOVide a pOSSible target for a

In heir stud of the fly, he researchers 
focused on a gene named boule that regu-
lates meiOSIS, a ey ~tep In the creation of 
sper and egg In all animals, Including 
humans In ne male fly, loss of he gene 
leads 0 meiotiC arres and hence Infertility. 
'Nn the SCientiSts Inseneo a normal copy

defe ive files, developmen 0 the fly 
sperm also resumed 

The new finding strongly suggests hat 
he human boule gene regula es meiOSIS In 
human sperm developmen . This IS slgnlfl-
can because about .30 percen of inferti le

Runoff voting 
system would 

improve UCSD 
At the Jan. meeting of the A.~. 

Council, the council voted 14-1 to create 
an ad hoc committee to review current vot-
mg procedures for A. . elections while 
exploring other methvJs that could possi-
bly improve the elections process. 

One type of voting system that ha been 
di cussed by councilmembers i the imple-
mentation of an instant runoff system. In an 
election conducted with the instant runoff 
wstem, \'oter rank the candidates in order 
(if preference. If one c;lI1didate recei\'es a 
tll<ljontv of the votes cast in his favor, he or 
she \Vlris the election. If a majority is nor 
reached 111 iria II\', the least-\·oted-for candl-
d,lte b eliminated from contention and his 
or her voters have their vote!> changed to 
the cmdidate who is preferred next. Thl 
process I~ repe,lted until one candidate g-ar-
nen 50 percent of the popular vote. ~ 

The instant runoff voting system allow 
\·oters to cast their choice for an ideal can .. 
didate while being assured that their vote 
will count when it matters mo t. A nation-
al campaign to implement instant runoff 
has been It:d by the Green Party - an 
orgJnization that ha drawn fire from 
Democratic loyalists who feel that the p ty 
has \\ cakened the American left by tapping 
into the liberal voter pool , thereby weaken-

in~ their overall chance at electing a liberal 
ca ndidate. Greens contend that if there had 
been an instant runoff intact during the 
2000 presidential election, Ralph Nader 
would not have been blamed for former 
\'ice President A1 Gore'~ lms of Florida's 
crucial electoral votes. 

Critics of the system cite that converting 
to the new format would be too costly ana 
too confusing. At the campus level, con-
verting to instant runoff would only require 
<l11 alteration in computer code considering 
;111 A.S. elections arc conducted via 
·tudentLink. The instant runoff system is 

no more confusing than choosing another 
ICC cream flavor upon learning that the 
store is out of rocky road. 

The (;/lfl1'ditl11 believe th<lt a candidate 
should only be elected if he or she is pre-
ferred by the majority of the voters, and 
that the AS Council has taken a progres-
sive step toward ensuring that future elec-
tions are conducted effiCiently by initiating 
such a study.

Bush dividend tax cut bears bad tidings 
Tax relief riddled with perk for the wealthy 
By EVAN McLAUGHLIN 

Semor Staff Writer 

I lavcn't we cen thIs god-awful 
movie before? 

Our tory IS usually set in the west 
somewhere, ,\,hen a cowboy runs for 
p'r SId vows ro bolster the economy 
6y cuto ng taxes or the nch folks who 
\·oted for rum so that they will, III 
return, ,pend the billions they receIve 
back on American goods and erVICC, 
trlcklmg down - no - flooding down 
to thc mIddle and worlung clas es 
fa,ter than a pIstol draw m a Texas 
duel. 

nfortunately for Americans, dur-
Ing the Ia t mOVIe, the cowboy wanted 
to ;pend an unprecedented amount of 
money dUring ~peacetlme" (although 
that terlll IS debatable) on wcapom and 
defense to scare off the 'oviet while 
holding true to maintaming tax cuts to 
(he wealthy. 111e money didn't trickle 
down, either; It ooz.ed more slowly 
than a chuck of lIlol~ e ' on a cold day. 
By the end of hIS term, taxe, for the 
upper clas; had been decreased from 
70 to 28 percent, and the federal deficit 
had ,I. .. yrod:eted from $1 tnllton to 
$3 .5 tnllion. 

You can't have your guns al/d but-
ter, as the ~tory goe - there' just 
not enough to go around. Whde 

ccretary of Defense Donald 
RUlllsfeld spouted off on Chri tmas 
Eve that the United States could win 
handily in both Iraq and North 
Korea, saying that "we are cap~ble of 
winning decisively in one and swiftly 
defea ting in the case of the other ... 
Let there be no doubt about It," 
George Jr. and friends were back at 
the ranch pUltll1g the finishll1g touch-
es on an economic packllge where 
taxes on stocK dIvidend would be 
eilininated. According to Bmh, the 
plan, which the White I louse con-
ceded wdl COSt over $600 bllhon o~er 
tllC next decade, "provide tax reltef 
to the workJllg CllIz.cns It IS a plan 
that I, a very faIr plan ."

that much money tied up in stocks 
that they are going to save oodles of 
money on thi plan? Bush officials 
estimate that a family of four in a 
$42,000 household will save $1,083 
annually. 

But is the dividend tax cut going to 
be the overriding factor in the thou -
and-plu dollars they are aving? By 

Vlrtue of being a family of four, there 
are two chi ldren, each worth an extra 
$400 111 the new plan. 

So how Illuch of the remaining 
$283 that Bush promises will thc typI-

both paid out an even 2 percent in (Ii,,-
idends from tile amount invested. For 
that typIcal American household with a 
net worth of $47,000, that's an annuJI 
average return of $79. 

So how much of that $79 i, taxed 
today? According to Stuart Rittcr, a 
certified financial planner at T Rowe 
Price securities, stock dividend, arc 
currently taxed at the same rate a~ onc', 
income. For the married couple hring-
ing home $42,000 annually, the tax rate 
is 15 percenr. 

So that American famdy of four 
with a 15 perc<:nt tax ratc and thc 
median net worth of $47,000 will I)c

$11.85 . 

Eleven eighty-five ? Many pcople 
can't buy a 12-pack of their favorite

o why the gripe if a middle-clm 
American family of four is still savIng 
over $1,000 annually? The gripe does-
n't stem from the money necessarily as 
it does front the means of the product. 

'11e overwhelming bulk of the sav-

Conventional courtesy lost today 
Politeness increasingly uncommon 

By EVELYN HSIEH 
Staff Writer 

In the modern age, we 've seen 
many things go the way of the 
dinosaur. Dot matrix printers. 
Audio and video cassettes. The 
Pets.com dog puppet. Manners. 

Perhaps the demise of that last 
archaic trait is the m ost unfortu-
nate. T he decline of courtesy is 
more apparent than ever, marking 
a sad trend in old values. 

We've all heard it before. 
Everyone probably has :1 s tory to 
tcll about a rude ccll phone inci-
dent by now; otlleone yakking 
away on their Nokia while the 
movie is playing - nobody can 
hear Leonardo DiCaprio' voice 
bur they now know that hirley 
wIll meet \Viii at Il p.m at 
Starbucks. 

Unfortunnely, the noticeable 
lack of manners· is not restricted 
Illerely to the mobile-device 
rcalm. Even though college-age 

~tudents arc not exactly noted for 
theIr etiquette, the depths of 
rudcness proba bl y would 
. I ~to und evcn theJackass folks, or 
,It le,l!>t Adam andler. 

i\ rypical lecture serves as an 
Idcal example. tudents who 
Jrr"c early it on the fringes of 
the rows of seats as if Peterson 
10 i ;1 Boeing 747. No window 
;cats here, so the late-arriving 
students who don't want to be 
fire hazards shove themselves 
towards the middle of the rows. 
Butll rypes of students contribute 
to an annoyingly disruptive 
atmosphere. The late students 

COMMENTARY 
have a way of briskly pushing 
themselves into the rows without 
apology. The ea rly s tudents 
attach themselves to the edge so 
as to holt as fast as they can after 
the last word is spoken. 

A worse crime is kicking and 
putting feet on chairs. It IS not a 
hard concept: If a person is it-
ting In a seat, they will not 
appreciate theIr backs being bar-
raged . I or wtll they appreciate 
seelllg chipped pedicures pro-
truding out of dirty nip-flops 
three inches from his or her face . 
In addi ti on, Illany students u e 
lecture time as social hour. I, toO, 
am often guilry of whispering to 
my neighbor instead of jotting 
down notes. 

The worst offense, however, 
has to be totally disregarding the 
professor. Students pack up as 
early as half an hour before the 
end of class as soon as they hear 
the words "next" or "later." As 

soon as a couple of students pack 
up their papers, the whole class 
sees it as cue to join the sympho-
ny of rustling, bustling and hus-
tling. 

A sadder example often occurs 
during lOth week. Last time I 
checked , it was customary to 
applaud after the last lecture. Not 
only do some whole classes bypass 
acknowledging the professor 
through applause, but they also 
walk out while the professor is still 
talking. T, too, want to sample the 
sweet sunshine before fina ls week, 
but can't it wai t? Even the most 
monotone-voiced, mundane-dis-
poscd professors deserve some 
sort of recognition. 

Other crimes include blowing 
smoke in people' faces and walk-
ing painstakingly slow down or up 
the Price Center stairs. If I want 
carcinogens floating into my facial 
Orifices, I'll suck a car exhaust 
pipe, thank you very much . 

Road rage is another clas ic 
example of complete paucity of 
courtesy. It'd be surprising to 
find anyone who has not experi-
enced or conveyed that sense of 
autOmobile-driven contempt. 
Getting cut off, tailed or honked 
at can aggravate even the most 
placid of temperaments. Once 
this born b has detona ted, the 
manners book is thrown out the 
window. 

Road rage channels a smor-
gasboard of typical symptOms of 
rudeness - cussing, gestures and 
even physical aggression.

Collection of random 
objects gives life worth 
stop 
that! 
Bertrand Fan 

O oe thing I've always partic-ularly enjoyed is owning a lot of crap. I refer not to the 
literal meaning of the word - I 
leave that hobby to one of my 
roommates but to the 
metaphorical meaning that I 
believe is deeper and more com-
plex, like people who usc Macs with 
"Free Tibet" stickers on them . 

To give yOIl a good example, III 
the living room we have a 6-foot-
long crayon, cardboard cut-outs of 
Boba Fett and atalie Portman, a 
magneuc dartboard, a hamster that 
si ngs "I'm Too Sexy For ,\;1y Shirt," 
a chandelier made of plastic bowl-
ing pins, a mobile advertising Air's 
Moon Safari, a glao;s head with a 
broken Coca-Cola bottle Itght 
underneath It, a posnnodern wind-
up toy, and a talking Iialloween 
bowl that I bought at RIte-Aid for 
75 percent off. And that 's IU t the 
stuff my glrlfriend lets me keep In 
there, although the Natalte 
Portman cut-out is sort of an ongo-
ing debate. On the patio, I have 
patriOtiC rope lights, an II1formalJ\e 
di play on how a car's brake ystem 
works, a et of golf clubs, an inflat-
able Monopoly set, an innatable 
Mr. Pibb display, and many, many 
improperly and Illegally used 
Priority Mail boxes filled to the 
brim with crap that just gets trans-
ported every time I move. 

The only thing I enjoy more 

than owning and buying crap is the 
impression that I'm getting .1 good 
deal when I'm buying crap. That's 
why, recently, I've been going to 
swap meets. There's one at SportS 
Arena every Saturday and Sunday 
near the wonderful strip cluh Les 
Girls, which I highly recommend 
because it is complete with pews so 
it's similar to a really dark funeral 
ceremony with naked chicks. 

Anyways, the swap meet is (julte 
large . There a re two kinds of 
booths available: personal crap .1Ilel 
retail crap. I try to avoid the retail 
crap tables; if I wanted a good pncc

her Jan. 9 commentary abom the 
dangers, both physical and envi-
ronmental, of sport utiliry vehi-

Ms. Linson, who are willing to 
voice their disbrust, automakers 
are dcveloping cleaner and more 
economical vehicles, as reported 
in the Jan. 6 onlinc edition of the

General Motors Corp.

Lethal vivisection of purpose-bred dogs is not necessary to teach pharmacology or 
physiology. These labs persist despite the fact that 95% of US medical schools kill 

no animal , let alone dogs, in pharmacology. And 82% kill no animals, let alone dogs, 
in phy iology. They persist despite opposition from hundreds of an Diego physicians 
who igned a petition urging that they cease. They persi t de pite the fact that they 

are not nece ary for re earch or surgery practice. They persist de pite animal use 
guideline urging replacement of lethal lab when alternatives are available. They 
per i t becau e the UCSD Animal ubject ommittee concludes that lethal dog 

vivisection labs involve "no animal welfare i sues." octors again t dog lab urge all 
MSI who feel inclined towards com pas ion and mercy to opt out of th e up oming 
lab before the Feb. J Deadlin . We also urge the UCSD ommunity to contact the 
Animal Subjects ommittee at iacuc@ucsd ,edu and expre s opposition to continued 

dog labs. You can learn more about phYSician opposition to UCSD Dog Labs by

Stop: Haggling an essential part of swap meets Letters: Stipends are a 
necessity for fairness continued from page 5 a swap meet, it is always appropriate 

to haggle. I love haggling. I'm not 
very good at it, but I havc somc fu n 
with it. Thc general rule of thumb 
is: Start at ha lf of what you want to 
pay for something because chances 
arc you' ll ultima tely end up at that 
number. I don't rcally follow tha t 
rule. First, if it isn't marked, I ask 
them the price. Then I for m a 
shocked cxpression on my face, 
carefully place the item down, and 
then start walking toward the next 
booth. Almost always, they'll drop 
their price. Then I'll subtract just a 
little bit more from that to make it 
worth my while, and buy it. This 
doesn't always work. 

Some peoplc think their sruff is 
such hot shit that they're doing you a 
favor by selling it to you. I was talk-
ing to this guy with a huge swastika 
flag behind his booth about his R2-
D2 cup. He wa convinced that it 
was worth, at the very least, $15. I 
offered him $2 for it , and he got a tad 
insulted. People tend to assign weird 
factors like nostalgia and how much 
they paid for it, which they try to 
apply toward the salc. If you piss 
thesc people off, they won't sell any-
thing to you at any COSt. I avoid buy-
ing from these people just Ollt of 
principle, just like they refuse to sell 
to me out of principle. 

On my la t trip, I got separated 
frum the person that drove me 
there, which is a dangerous spot to 
be in. I walked around for a good 
hour and decided to bite the bullet 
,111(1 visit the snack bar. Whoever 
inventcd the snack bar back in the 
day ~ure was an asshole. [ imaginc 
the conversation went like this:

I paid something like $4 for 

some fries, but was so pissed about 
getting financially raped that I 
refused to get the Coke. Thirty 
minutes later, I was thirsty. Really 
thirsty. Crawling-in-the-Sahara-
desert thirsty. Some old lady 
offered me a Coke from her cooler 
for SO. 7 S. "That's funny, you don't 
look like a vending machi ne," I 
thought. r rcfused Out of principle, 
and no less than 100 feet later, some 
b'1.ly propositions me, "I ley, buddy? 
\Vant a nice free drink? All YOll got 
to do IS watch part of 'Ball !Joys 2' 
,md tell us what yuu think:J 

I fi gured, what the hell . Why 
not' So thcn thl ' Ieu]y pull, me in \" \h 

back and interrogates me. Asks me 
questions like if I've seen "Men in 
Black II" and how I feel about 
Martin Lawrence. It was the fir t 
time in my life anybody had ever 
asked me how I felt about Martin 
Lawrence. Then we watched the 
preview, and she said, "What do 
you remember from that?" 

"Umm ... there were explosions 
and sruff." 

"Here, watch it again." 
Before I could refuse, she had 

already started it again. 1 made a 
mental note to remember some-
thing, just to stop the thing from 
repeating itself. 

"Well, what do you remember?" 
"Uhhh ... I remember this tree, 

and then it said, 'produced by Jerry 
Bruckheimer,' and explosions and 
stuff. It was a lot like every movie 
produced by Jerry Bruckheimer." 

"What would you say the movie 
was about?" 

"You know, I really couldn't tell 
you." 

She proceeded with a long list of 
questions while I tried to explain to 
her that there was no way in hell I 
was going to s(!e this movie, no 
matter what the preview was, unless 
it was a preview for a different 
movie, like "The Bare 'vVench 
Project 3." After the interrogation 
was over, she told me I could go to 
the cooler and pick out a dri nk. 

I open the cooler, and I'll be 
damned if it wasn't all Simply Soda, 
which is halfway between Triametic 
and liquid shi t. I'm not going to lie, 
I drank it, but let this be a lesson for 
you. There are free cheeseburgers 
at Cheetah at lunchtime.

contin~d from page 6 
The UCSA Board has long 

talked about providing a sti pend 
to the chair and vice chair because 
these positions require a tremen-
dous amount of dedica tion to the 
organization and long working 
hours. The chair manages not 
only the full-time executive direc-
tor, but also sets meeting agendas, 
coordi nates UCSA committee 
chairs and speaks with reporters 
about UCSA objectives whenever 
they call. The chair is also often 
out of town attending several 
meetings, including Regents 
meetings, UCOP meetings, state 
legislative meetings and other 
organization mectings that 
involve our allies. The Board's 
rationale behind offering the 
sti pend was to increase the num-
ber of candidates who are able to 
run for the chair and vice chai r 
positions. 

Without a tipend, many snl-
dents would not have the "luxury" 
of running for these positions. 
[n tead, highly qualified srudent 
might have to choose paid 
employment to make ends meet. 
[t is not feasible that a srudent 
take four classes, dedicate an 
additional 20-30 hours per week 
as UCSA's chair, and then work a 
paying job. Additionally, the 
move to offer stipends is not 
unprecedented; several student 
associations offer stipends 
($1 ,200 per month at some 
Universities of Califorlll a) to 
their officers. Still other associa-
tions, such as the U.S. tudent 
AsSOCIation, require that their 
officers to take a year off from 
a ademi work because of the 

long hours involved . Our of these 
considerations and more, the 
Board unanimously approved a 
monthly $350 stipend for thc 
chair and $250 stipend for the 
vice chair. 

Finally, the st<Jte of CalifornIa 
and the UC system are facing a 
tough year of budget cuts. For 
instance, in the govcrnor\ hud-
get, proposed student fee 
incrca es are set at 29 percent for 
undergraduates, 32 percent for 
grad ua tCS and 35 percent for 
professional students. As ,uch, 
UCSA wanted to ensure that the 
chair and vice chair could invc, t 

a~ much tllne as possible advo-
cating against thcse prop'hcti 
tuition increases, rJther than hc 
forced to take gamful employ-
ment during thesc tOugh eco-
nomic times. The UCSA \Yeh 
site (bttP://WWW.llfJO.Olg) " cur-
rently being given an overhaul, 
but will be up and running short-
ly. Students are welcome to con-
tact their external affairs officers

not a crime, but unreported inci-
dents can cscalatc to a crime. This 
is the first phase - not liking

here, it could become a phYSical 
fight or arrack." 

Urrccho del Ca~tillo also said 
rllat plum c1othes-wcaring C:!lllpUS

"It is a planning project, and the

and will not serve the arcas that 
need traffic relief thc most. 

Peters, whose di trict lI1c1udes

and Sorrento Vallc)" said that more 
creative solutions need 10 be 
explored, given the high cost of 
bringing light rail to his district. 

"I just hatc to sec liS burning up 
so much pubhc money to cover so 
little ground," he said. "I thll1k if 
we looked at some odler technolo-
gies, we could gct everyrhll1g the

the bus rapid transit system could

THURSDAY. JANUARY 16. 200) 

Hours: Philosophical plot 
will hold your attention 

continmd from page 9 
obvious that Brown does not fully 
fit into her domestic position as 
homemaker and wife. Throughout 
her day - during which she tries 
to make a cake for her husband's 
birthday, considers ending her life 
and talks about motherhood with a 
friend - her discontentlnent and 
disconnect.ion with what is going 
on around her is very apparent. 
With subtle facial movements, 
Moore ideally latches on to the 
character's longing. and her ulti -
mate. desperate decision. 

The most poignant sequences. 
and probably the most difficult for 
Moore (who has three children of 
her own), are the interactions 
betwee n Brown and her son 
Richi e Oack Rovello). 

The more Ri chie, who senses 
that there is something wrong 
with his mother. questions her 
love for him and tries to star with 
her. the more she pushes him 
away while vocally trying to com-
fort him . These moments are 
quite disturbing. but at the same 
time brilliantly executed. 

The third woman is Clari s a 
Vaughan (Meryl Streep). a modem 
version of WooIrs character. Mrs. 
Dalloway, who lives in ew York in 
2001. Vaughan is furiously working 
to prepare a party for her friend 
Richard (Ed Harris). a great and 
difficult poet who is dying of AlDS. 
Vaughan also struggles with finding 
meaning in her life while he goes 
to purchase flowers; shares an inti-
mate and tense conver ation with 
Richard and Richard ' ex-
boyfriend. Loui Water Qeff 
Daniels); and interacts with her 
live-in girlfriend. Sally Lester 
(Allison Janney). and her daughter. 
J uJia (Claire Danes). 

Through Vaughan. Streep is 

able to create yet another varied 
character who is also questioning 
her life. During her long. strenuous 
day. the character suffers two over-
the-top but understandable emo-
rional breakdowns. which Streep 
displays with ease and makes COIl1 -
pletely titting for the nervous. 
upright persona she portrays. 

Harri stands out with nis per-
formance as a destructive. hard-to-
deal-with genius poet who is him-
self struggling with inner demons 
while the end of his Jife nears. The 
actor seems to have found a niche 
playing brilliant. difficult artists (he 
also got rave reviews as the strug-
gling painter Jackson Pollock in 
"Pollock"). 

The conn ections between the 
three women are made clear in 
well-edited and flowing transition 
sequences. as well as during a mar-
ve lous revelatory sequence toward 
the end of the film when the c ha r-
acters sOl1lewhat come to terms 
with their yearnings. 

Overall. the film is a fantastic 
enterprise that is worth seeing 
because of the interesting philo-
sophical questions that it raises. 
the powerful and moving way in 
which the dramati c issues are 
probed and explored. and the 
amazing cast that bring such intel-
ligence. complcxiry and depth to 
their character that it is COIll -
pelling to watch them undergo 
their inner struggles.

If this is 'A Guy Thing,' then 
you can call me Suzy 

The newest offering from Jason Lee is poor schlock 
By DAVID BYNUM 

Senior Staff Writer 

The aptly named "A Guy Thing" fai ls to commit. and it drinks stra ight from the canon on its way to boring its viewers. 
While the weight of the film rested on Jason 
Lec's shoulders. not even Arnold could have 
borne the weight of this ridiculously trite 
excursion in combining ideas from other bad 
films. From the "Dead Man on Campus" 
typecast maniac to Lee' character, nearly 
cverytning in this mm had been done before. 
and done better. Even a number of Lee's fan-
ta sy sequence scenes fe lt like rip-offs from 
the Be 's "Scrubs." 

"A G uy Thing" draws most of its comedy 
from the interesting differences between 
men and women. As a wedding date fast 
approaches. catastrophe ensues. Instead of 
making intelligent observations about the 
differences between the sexes. it takes steps 
backwards, repeating lines that everyone has 
heard from men before. such as "it's natural. 
we are hunters." Meanwhile. the womenfolk 
are ba ically unable to do anything but worry 
about the wedding amidst believing the bar-
rage of snlpid lies told to them by their sig-
nificant other . 

The real question that the film asks the 
viewer is: Who is hotter. Selma Blair or Juli a 
Sti les' Viewers were given nearly two hours 
to ponder a question that most guys can 
answer in less than five seconds. T he prob-
lem is that by the end of the film. it is diffi-

~ REVIEW 

cult to feel anything but indifferent about the 
question due to the number of times that 
their characters cause dry heaving. In this 
classic battle between the rese.rved brunette 
and the buxom blonde. there are no winners 
- just losers and a lot of bad acting. 

The film earns its one and a half stars by 
delivering olle line that got the entire audience 
laughing. wh.ich just happens to be the film's 
title. A background of semi-comedic suppon-
ing roles fails to white out the fact that there 
are no other redeeming qualities in t11 is film . 
While the film fails to be romantic or funny. 
the fact that "A Guy thing" was released dur-
ing awards season makes this misdemeanor a 
felony. While it is difficult to imagine a time of 
year when this film could do well. the long list 
of excellent films in theatres right now makes it 
easy to make the statement: There is no reason 
to see this film.

offers a different aspect of Koite's

If the wide press coverage of 
Koite's past U.S. tour is any-
thing to go by, the artist and his

great live act, interacting wi th

East Coast native Ari Hest to 
bring acoustic rock to lwiggs 

Alternative singer, songwriter will perform at 
the small North Park stage Jan, 21 
By NEHA SINGH 

Staff Writer 

After a long, crazy weekend, what 
could be better than unwinding with 
a fabulous acoustic singer/song-
writer at a local coffee shop' East-
Coast native Ari Hest is cOllting to 
Twigg's on Jan. 2 1, and if the show is 
anything like his other ones, it wi ll 
be amazing. 

Music runs strong in Hest's fa nti-
Iy: His father is a college music pro-
fessor and his mother is a profession-
al singer. His father had him inging 
at the young age of 7, but it wasn't 
until the later days of high school 
that he began to use music as his 
refuge. He was il15pired by bands 
like Pearl Jam and Smashing 
Pumpkins, along with arti rs like 
Dave Matthews and Jeff Buckley. 
These influences are evident in his 
own songs, and can be heard when 
he does covers at shows. 

With a voice reminiscent of 
James Taylor and Peter Gabriel, 
Hesr has gone from being a college 
student playing out his hobby for 

other students to being a career 
musician. He recorded his first LP, 
"Incomplete," while in his sopho-
more year at NYU, and soon fol -
lowed it up with his second aibulll, 
"Come Home." After a lot of COIll-
posing and tollring, he released his 
latest album, "Story After Story." 

Si nce fa ll of 200 I, Il est has 
played more than 200 shows at clubs 
and campuses, and all this experience 
has given him a reputation as an out-
standing live performer. With beau-
tiful songs like "Caught Up In Your 
Love" and "Didn't Want to Say 
Goodbye," Hest has been picking up 
fal15 all over the country. His honest, 
easy voice and rare talent for good 
songwriting doesn't hurt him either. 

Hcst's enthusiasm for every show 
he plays is almost a brllarantec for a 
good show on the 21st. With an 
adjoining Green Room, 1\vigg's also 
prontises to be a good vcnue for his 
acoustic talent, ans thc noise 01 peo-
ple and e presso machines. But hey, 
if you're one of those rare people 
who can't tand the mu ic, at least 
you can get decent cup of coffee.

Bjork Scam: Icelander never scheduled 
Pop icon falsely billed to play at The Flame; can artist steals show 

By JESSICA KRUSKAMP 
Senior Staff Writer 

Look up the word "hoax" in any 
dictionary and you will see picnlres 
of the Loch e Monster, Bigfoot 
.1Ilt! our pi.xie-faced friend from thc 
icy north, Bjork. 

No, Bjork really is a singer from 
Iceland, but her name has been 
mixed up in what shall be hence-
forth cllled "The Great San Diego 
Bjork I loax." 

The Icelandic star was suppos-
edly scheduled to play a sma ll 
I lillcresr c1\1b, The Flame, on)3n. 
15. Tickets were old and fans 
were excited. A concert of such 
proportions - huge Star meets 
tiny club - was a once-in-a-life-
lime show. 

The Flame's plans were 
snuffed out when Alex onate, 
the Illan who was to bring Bjork 
to tOwn, allegedly fled with

he knew Bjork from producing the 
lcdJndic version of her albul11, 
"llol11ogcnic." 

Thollgh Pollard reportedly 
found no Icelandic version of 
hlIomogenic" online or in record 
stores, he trusted Conate enough to 
let him stay at his home for a month 
and coordinate a concert. Pollard 
received e-mails from "Bjork" 
detailing her arrival for the show.

Sheep: Taking a look at who

continued from page 12 
American pllblic rcally have to go 
through the motions of pretending 
that Pink is a brilliant artist worthy 
of an award? This is a person who 
sings other peopl es !>onf,'S about not 
being Britney Without undcr~tal1ll­
ing that she is something much 
worse, namely the media's knee-Jerk 
reaction to Brimey. I'm not ~ure If 
she realizes that she could ncver 
have existed if Britney hadn't existed 
first. Maybe we will all find out if 
she wins. Dllring her acceptance 
speech, perhaps amidst thanking all 
of the people that wrote her songs, 
she can thank Britney for not being 
Pink. 

What is NARAS anyway? Well , 
ARAS is compri ed essentially of 

I ,000 elf-i nterested producers, 
musicians and music indu try 
moguls. These people make these 
nominations to try to sell more of 
thcse albums. There rcally i~n 't .lIIY 
money to be made in finding an 
IIndcr-appreciated artist and nOIllI-
natlng them for an award. Th.lt "

N \HAS would be a worthless II1Sti-
tution whose ole purpose \Va to 
promote an mdustry that is COIll-
prised completely of its own mem-
bers. No, ARAS has a traveling 
middle school education program to 
help children become more II1terest-
ed in the musical arrs. What does 
this program do' Maybe it teaches 
the children how to wear a wifebeat-
er, wear a loose tie around the neck, 
die their hair pink, put a Band-Aid 

on their face, and sing songs about 
either how they hate their mothcr or 
how to dump their skater boyfnend,
