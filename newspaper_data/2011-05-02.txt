Full Sun God lineup Announced

By Laira Martin
Associate News Editor

Nearly a month after revealing that Wiz Khalifa will be headlining the Sun God Festival, A.S. Concerts and Events Media Liaison Oliver 
Zhang disclosed the remainder of the lineup just two 
weeks before the May 13 festival. 

“We had to wait for contracts and finalizing [event 
details],” Zhang said. “We wanted to announce this in 
one big wave.”

Rapper Big Sean, who has toured with Wiz Khalifa, 
will be performing on the main stage in between 
Mike Posner and Crystal Castles. Other main stage 
performances include Best Coast, Jimmy Eat World and 
Battle of the Bands Winner Kera and the Lesbians.

This year, the dance tent will now be a much larger 
enclosed dance stage.

“The dance stage will have a club feel to it,” Zhang 
said. “It will be much larger, there won’t really be a 
particular capacity. It will be more like a second main 
stage.”

New dance stage acts will include performances 
from electronic artists LA Riots, Kill the Noise and 
Ocelot. DJ Battle Winner DJ Philly and DJ Battle 
Finalists NOLD and the Dream Team will perform on 
the dance stage.

Midway stage acts include the Australian comedy 
group Axis of Awesome, circus performance group 
Cirque Berzerk and comedians Dan Gurewitch and 
Streeter Seidel from www.collegehumor.com.

San Diego beverage store D’lush — the official 
beverage sponsor for this year’s event — will be serving 
iced drinks in a 3,200 square-foot lounge with couches 
and a large seating area. 

“There will be several bars serving various mixed 
drinks,” Zhang said. “There will be plasma screens with 
live feeds from the [festival].”

In an effort at making the festival greener, 
sustainability projects will be initiated this year. 
Students with reusable water bottles will be given free 
cold water, while those without bottles can purchase

UCSD DelayS 
Opening new 
Heart Center
By Sarah Kang
Staff Writer

UCSD delayed the opening of its Sulpizio 
Cardiovascular Center — San Diego’s first dedicated 
heart center — due to care issues within existing 
emergency rooms. The center, scheduled to open in 
April 4, is now planned to open later this month.

UCSD Health System donors and community 
leaders held a ribbon-cutting ceremony on March 4 
in front of SCVC, which is located next to Thornton 
Hospital.  Six years since Richard and Gaby Sulpizio 
donated $10 million to help build the center, and over 
two years after the construction began, administrators 
postponed the opening of the four-story center in 
order to address two recent incidents in existing 
emergency rooms at Thornton Hospital.  

In February, Elizabeth Maher — an 89-year-old 
nursing home patient who attempted suicide after 
being diagnosed with liver cancer — was admitted to 
Thornton Hospital. A state public health department 
report said a psychologist placed Maher under suicide 
watch. But a nurse assumed the watch was lifted 
and left her unattended, during which the patient 
strangled herself with an oxygen tube. 

The other incident, which took place March 24, 
involved a woman who went to Hillcrest Medical 
Center’s ER for a burn on the roof of her mouth and 
refused to leave after treatment. The report revealed 
that she had a history of breathing problems and 
had visited the hospital four times before. Security 
guards, a charge nurse and a technician carried her to 
a sidewalk and lay her face down. Later, the ER nurse 
manager warned that lying face-down could impair 
breathing. The patient, when turned over, underwent 
respiratory and cardiac arrest. The report cited the 
hospital’s failure to provide proper medical care as 
well as its breach of respect for the patient.

The state issued a 62-page “Statement of 
Deficiencies” report to the university and ordered it 
to fix the two hospitals’ emergency departments so 
that such incidents will not reoccur. 

“It is important to note that this delay is not 
related to our cardiovascular care nor to the physical 
readiness of the SCVC building,” UCSD spokesperson 
Jacqueline Carr said. 

The hospital’s clinical teams and regulatory affairs 
conducted an in-depth review of the two incidents in 
order to improve the hospital’s care system. 

“We have responded by rapidly implementing 
a comprehensive plan of correction which 
includes improved communication, new systems 
for re-evaluating patients, careful monitoring 
of compliance with our established policies and 
procedures and appropriate disciplinary action,” Carr 
said.

Investigators attributed the incidents to a severe 
lack of communication between hospital personnel. 
According to a San Diego Union-Tribune article titled, 
“State orders fixes at 2 UCSD emergency rooms,” one 
of the corrections will be that doctors will be required 
to re-assess any patients reluctant to be discharged.

UCSD submitted a correction plan to the 
California Department of Public Health. Details of 
the plan cannot be revealed until approved by CDPH. 
Pending the plan’s approval, UCSD will request a 
final inspection — which, if passed, will result in the 
issuance of a license and the center’s opening.

According to Carr, the new center will be will have 
54 in-patient beds, four cardiovascular operating 
rooms, four cardiac catheterization laboratories, a 
non-invasive cardiovascular laboratory, outpatient 
clinics and an expanded emergency department.

Scripps researchers track radioactive Debris From Japan
scieNce and techNoLoGY

By Anqi Chen
Staff Writer

Researchers from the Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography are 
tracking and modeling radioactive 
debris released from Japanese nuclear 
power plants to determine when they 
will reach U.S coasts.

Associate Project Scientist and 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration Global Drifter 
Program Principal Investigator 
Luca Centurioni will look at ocean 
currents in the Pacific Ocean to 
predict movement of the debris 
caused by the March 11 earthquake 
that hit Japan.

Working with Woods Hole 
Oceanographic Institute and 
University of Hawaii’s International 
Pacific Research Center, researchers 
predict that it will take two to three 
years for the debris to reach Hawaii 
and the West Coast.

To see how much radioactive 
debris entered the ocean and where it 

is heading, researchers will deploy 60 
drifters — buoy devices that measure 
ocean currents and are capable of 
transmitting data  — from U.S. Coast 
Guard aircraft this summer

“These drifters will be placed off 
the coast of Japan in the Northeast 
Pacific, as close to concentrated piles 
of debris as possible,” Centurioni said. 

According to Centurioni, 
researchers are not using satellite 
tracking because the surface debris 
are too small and current models of 
ocean circulation will not accurately 
show where it’s heading. 

Centurioni said tracking nuclear 
debris will not be an easy task. In 
the months since the earthquake, 
satellite evidence has shown patches 
of concentrated debris dispersed 
because of wind and ocean currents.

“The dispersion effect is great,” 
Centurioni said. “At first, the debris 
collected in patches, but now a lot 
of the material — and I’m not sure 
how much — has been broken up by 
the waves. Plastic, for example, can 

be degraded by UV radiation and 
broken into small pieces by waves.”

Along with other 900 drifters 
worldwide, Centurioni also deployed 
some fake debris to help better 
observe and model the movement of 
ocean pollution. Researchers plan to 
coordinate debris sightings with ships 
crossing the ocean.

Centurioni does not believe that 
frequent beachgoers and surfers 
should worry about the radioactivity.

“We should be worried in the 
sense that it is a large amount of 
pollution that is not good for the 
ocean and has an impact on the 
environment,” Centurioni said. “But 
people should not be any more 
worried than they currently are about 
the pollution in the ocean.”

Currently, Centurioni is trying to 
work with the Japanese government 
and funding agencies to raise funds 
for the planes needed to deploy 
drifters. 

“We are trying to work with 
Japan, but it is difficult because of the 

different policies,” Centurioni said. 
“When instruments involve satellites, 
we need permits and have to pay for 
permit fees.”

When the debris hits, it is expected 
to enter a swirling ocean current 
called the “Great Pacific Garbage 
Patch,” which rotates and sometimes 
dumps floating trash onto beaches in 
Hawaii and the northwest coast.

Decreased Security 
at SG Festival
compostable cups for $1 to discourage 
waste. Styrofoam cups will be banned.

CarbonGuard — a San Diego-
based environmental organization 
focused on preventing waste — will 
be working with ASCE to offset the 
carbon emissions produced by event.

“We tell them how many people 
drive [and] fly to Sun God, attendance 
and how much energy is used and they 
calculate the carbon emissions and 
then offset it,” Zhang said.

Twenty-two different student 
organizations will have booths at 
the festival along with professional 
vendors selling food and drinks along 
Hopkins Drive — which is renamed 
“Sun God Avenue” for the day of the 
event.

Other changes include a guest 
ticket price increase from $41 to $50. 
ASCE sold 3,500 guest tickets last year 
but reduced the amount to 3,000 this 
year. Guest tickets sold out in four 
days, according to Zhang. 

Wristbands will be distributed 
to undergraduates with student 
identification on Marshall Field on 
May 12 and 13.

Security costs decreased compared 
to last year due to a shorter festival 
time. Past festivals ran from 12 p.m. to 
midnight but gates will not open until 
2 p.m. this year. 

Coordinators are focusing on 
logistical issues for the next two weeks.

“With the event quickly 
approaching, what we have left to do 
is continue to finalize the logistics 
of the event,” Festivals Coordinator 
Melissa McCoy said. “We are working 
on staffing and prepping for overall 
day-of production needs.   These sort 
of logistical aspects are what build this 
event, and make it what it is.”

Yes.

Every high school had them: those couples that would start dating at the very end of 
senior year, embrace summer love 
and then, optimistically — and a 
little naively — tell each other they 
would stay together, even though 
they were going to college thou-
sands of miles apart. Fast forward 
to winter break and you’d be lucky 
if you could find one pair that was 
still together.

For as long as I can remember, 
I’ve thought long-distance relation-
ships are for hopeless romantics 
(i.e., schmucks). I swore I would 
never be one of “those” people. 

Two years later, I’m in a rela-
tionship with a navy boy and 
— dare I say it — the “L” word is 
in the air. When we first started 
dating, he wasn’t scheduled to be 
deployed anytime in the next year. 
Unfortunately, a few months later, 
he got a call from his chief officer: 
In a month, he would be sent on a 
six-month deployment. 

Like high-school sweethearts, 
we made the most of that month: 
camping, rollerblading in PB and 
spending as much time together as 
possible. Then we were faced with 
decision of what we’d do after he 
left. 

Every couple thinks that they’re 
“different” and they can make it 
through the long distance. We 
believed the name.

What was different, though, and 
more difficult, for us was that while 
most long-distance relationships 
stay connected via Skype, Facebook 
and phone calls, we have no such 
luck while he’s 5,000 miles away in 
the middle of the ocean. 

Technology is no longer an 
option. Instead, our communication 
is limited to that of a World-War-
II-era couple: hand-written letters, 
care packages and photos that take 
weeks to arrive is the best we’ve got. 

As much as you can try to men-
tally and emotionally prepare your-
self for not seeing someone you love 
for six months, there’s really not 
much you can do other than con-
stantly repeat that it’ll work out. 

At first, every little thing 
reminded me of him. I assumed 
that all those little memory trig-
gers would eventually fade and 
life would return to the way it was 
before. But a month later, that’s still 
not the case. 

I’d be lying if I said it was easy 
and I never had doubts. What’s 
important is remembering to stay 
positive and trusting.

While missed birthdays and 
holidays are hard, the cliché “things 
could be worse” has proven true. 
Instead of being deployed or off 
at college in some faraway state, 
he could be a musician on tour of 
every college town in America, with 
skanky co-eds throwing themselves 
at him at every last pit stop. 

Another thing to remember 
is to keep the negative people — 
people like the former me — at bay. 
While they may be your friends or 
coworkers, unless they’ve been in 
your situation, their opinion doesn’t 
hold much weight. People like them 
only cause unnecessary doubt; all 
you really need is a little extra post-
age and faith.

A Change of 
Pace

For Fall 2011, the UC campuses — with the exception of UC Merced and UCLA — will con-
tinue a systemwide waitlist program 
for freshmen applicants that began 
last year. 

Davis and UCSD will extend their 
waitlist offers to transfer applicants 
as well; this system will give greater 
numbers of students a better chance 
of attending a UC school and, more 
importantly, will mollify the prob-
lem of over-enrollment, making it 
a worthwhile 
program that 
benefits both 
the administra-
tion and the 
students. 

This 
upcoming 
academic year 
marks the 
second year 
that a system-
wide waitlist 
program has 
been in effect. 
During the admissions period, 
134,029 students applied to the UC 
system, a 12-percent increase over 
Fall 2009 when there was no wait-
list. In the past few years, a high 
admissions yield rate has led to over-
enrollment. 

Across the entire UC system, 
overenrollment —or the number of 
extra students not accounted for by 
state funding — tops 11,000. When 
the new waitlist system was enacted 
last year, administrators like Debora 
Obley, associate vice president for 
budget operations in the UC Office 
of the President, hoped it would 
prevent the problem of over-crowded 
classes and housing while ensuring 
that all possible spots are filled. 

According to a release from the 
news office of the University of 
California, over 11,000 waitlist places 
were extended across all of the UC 
campuses last year — though only 
UC Davis and UC Santa Barbara 

actually admitted students from their 
respective waitlists. 

The other campuses reached tar-
get enrollments, according to Frank 
Wada, executive director of under-
graduate admissions in UC Davis, 
without needing to dip into their 
waitlist to fill spots up. 

UCSD, for its part, offered 2,756 
students an opportunity to partici-
pate in the waitlist process — only 
27.8 percent accepted a waitlist spot. 
This yield rate will be an important 

indicator in the coming 
years to determine how 
many UCSD hopefuls will 
actually want to get on the 
waitlist — and eventually 
into the school. 

According to a March 
30 article in UCSB’s Daily 
Nexus entitled “UCs Offer 
Enrollment Waitlisting,” 
UCSB took 17,744 — 45.5 
percent — of its 42,542 
freshmen applicants and 
6,049 — 54.1 percent — 
of its 11,178 prospective 

transfer students in Fall 2010 from its 
waitlist. UC Davis offered admission 
to 600 students.

This year, UCSD and UC Davis 
will be the only universities of the 
UC system to enact a transfer wait-
list. UC Davis plans to have a waitlist 
of 800 students. These students are 
guaranteed housing and orientation 
if admitted. The details for the UCSD 
transfer waitlist are, however, unclear. 

UC spokesperson Ricardo 
Vasquez stressed that the UC system 
views a waitlist as an “enrollment 
management tool” to ensure that 
students have the greatest chance 
possible to potentially attend a UC 
campus. Although only two universi-
ties actually accepted applicants from 
their waitlists, the system is benefi-
cial to the universities themselves. 
UC Irvine and UC Santa Cruz are 
currently considering offering trans-

Waiting in the Wings
After giving waitlists a trial run last year, the UC system needs to look back and see how they can be 

improved and applied to transfer students. 

Dear Editor,
Students for Justice in Palestine 

recently proposed a resolution 
about divesting from corporations 
that profit off violent conflict. The 
response from certain groups on 
campus, in my opinion, has been 
disproportionate to the content of 
this proposal.

The document, which can be 
found on SJP’s website, advocates 
for corporate responsibility from 
companies that benefit from violence 
in the Palestine/Israel territories. 
As a consumer in this capitalism-
based country, I am again and again 
appalled by the immoral acts of 
companies. From Forever 21 buy-
ing out a community garden, to 
Walmart building on burial grounds 
in Hawaii, corporations that have 
little regard for human life enjoy big 
returns in their business.

The companies outlined in 
SJP’s resolution are not any dif-
ferent. Human Rights Watch and 
Amnesty International both cite 
Apache helicopters as causing civil-
ian deaths, helicopters that use parts 
produced by GE and Northrop 
Grumman.  These companies do 
not care that innocent people die as 
a result of their work. Nor do they 
care if Palestinians, Israelis or any-
one from any other country are put 
in harm’s way. Corporations exist to 
generate profit.  The only ones that 
reap reward from violence in the 
area are these corporations.

Furthermore, corporate respon-
sibility is a precedence that UCSD 
has set time and time again, no 
matter what the political climate. 
When UCSD recommended divest-
ing from Nestle due to harmful baby 
powder, the act was not seen as 
delegitimizing Switzerland. Rather, 
it sent the message that this com-
pany should not make a profit by 
taking advantage of people. GE and 

Northrop Grumman should, also, 
not take advantage of tensions in the 
Palestinian/Israeli area to generate 
profit. All of our institutions and 
corporations should act morally, and 
perpetuating ongoing violent con-
flict is not the way to do it.

The campus community should 
be disappointed in the way certain 
groups portrayed corporate respon-
sibility as something to be disliked 
or even feared. Though everyone is 
welcome to have whatever opinion 
they want about world events, we as 
UCSD students and the future lead-
ers of this country should uphold 
moral values — including corporate 
responsibility. Furthermore, I am 
embarrassed that my college council 
at TMC advised its A.S. representa-
tives to vote against the bill. It seems 
as though us Marshall students have 
forgotten that are college was created 
to stand for “public service, social 
equality and justice.”

I hope that the larger campus 
community continues to support the 

tenets and principles of this univer-
sity by divesting from GE, Northrop 
Grumman and any other company 
that profit from violence in the 
world. As a student at this institu-
tion whose presence and tuition go 
to supporting UCSD, not divesting 
would mean that I effectively am 
perpetuating conflicts that cause 
harm to others. I would not like to 
have that on my conscience, and I 
doubt anyone else would.

As scary as the thought of Apple tracking its customers’ whereabouts may be, consumers need not fear — Apple 
is merely using this location data to improve user experiences.

The iPhone and iPad both obtain anonymous, encrypted 
location data. 

Not only is it impossible to pinpoint the exact real-time 
locations of users after the fact; the data cannot be traced back 
to specific users. 

While many allegations have emerged about police forces 
using the data, in accordance to the Fourth Amendment, they 
cannot obtain data without a search warrant. 

The Cupertino-based company maintains that the iPhone 
merely keeps track of Wi-Fi hotspots and nearby cell tower 
locations (which can be picked up more than 100 miles away). 
This allows the device to estimate the location of the user 
through GPS applications. The data is used not to keep tabs 
on consumers, but to power popular iPhone functions like 
driving directions. 

For those who are still not convinced, a free software 
update that will prevent the local cache from storing data over 
seven days old will be released within the next few weeks. This 
update will allow users to turn location services off, entirely 
removing the stored cache. 

This option is also found on smartphones designed by 
Google, Microsoft and Nokia — none of whom have seen 
harm in storing location data. According to Apple, the next 
version of the iOS 4.3.3 or 4.4 mobile operating system will 
even be designed to encrypt each device’s cache.

C’mon, There’s No Conspiracy Here

QUICKTAKES  Apple iPhone and iPad Tracking Controversy 

Be careful — your beloved iPhone may well be the source of your next few trips to the courthouse. Security 
researchers have recently discovered a disturing hidden fea-
ture in Apple’s iPhone and iPad. 

Not only does it keep track of where its users go (a neces-
sary feature for apps like Maps), but it saves every detail of 
their location down to the latitude and longitude. 

When your iPhone is synched up to a computer, that data’s 
transferred over — a feature Apple users never signed up for 
when they dropped $300 on the latest and greatest.

While other mobile operating systems such as Android 
require their users to specifically make their data available, the 
iPhone records the data regardless of user consent. 

Other concerns are swirling around the possibility that the 
police can obtain user data to use against them in a court of 
law. 

Under the Regulation of Investigatory Power Act, a search 
warrant is required before such data can be obtained — but if 
all of the data was not saved in the first place, there wouldn’t 
be such a threat to privacy. 

Another major issue is that anybody — from a jealous 
significant other to a random thief — could steal your iPhone 
or iPad, and have instant access to your whereabouts for the 
last year. 

Though Apple is claiming that this is just a bug, there is 
simply no need for iPhones to store that much data. Though 
this may be the Information Age, there are just some things 
that people want to keep to themselves.

—Margaret Yau
Opinion Editor 

Investigations into the surveillance capability of iPhones and iPads are unsettling many consumers. 
Devices running iOS, Apple’s mobile operating system, 

routinely track the user’s location using Wi-Fi hotspots and 
cell towers. These positions are stored locally for easy retriev-
al by apps and the file is covertly sent to Apple when synced 
to a computer — an action that has raised cries of privacy 
invasion. 

 These files, however, are nothing new. Other technology 
giants have been collecting this data for years.

These problems are a symptom of a new technological 
shift, and Apple isn’t the only company with these prob-
lems. 

This event calls to mind Google’s misstep last year. 
Controversy surrounded Google for its “accidental” accumu-
lation of unencrypted wireless data while taking snapshots for 
its Street View feature. 

Apple has found itself in a similar position —      users are 
suing Apple over the alleged tracking, claiming that is violat-
ing privacy and the law. Apple is listening to user concerns 
and will, in a few weeks, offer a free software update that will 
only allow iOS devices to store data for one week.

This isn’t necessarily a Big Brother situation, but it isn’t 
something that users should brush off, either. Consumers 
need to be aware of what information their personal electron-
ics store. Technology giants will continue to push the bound-
aries; it’s up to their customers to question their practices and 
let the industry know when it’s gone too far.

fer students waitlisting for the 2012 
application period. 

One benefit of the current wait-
list system is that it doesn’t leave 
low-income families in the lurch 
when it comes to financial aid. The 
UC Blue and Gold program guar-
antees funding for tuition and fees 
to qualified students with a family 
income less than $70,000. When a 
waitlist offer is extended to a pro-
spective student by a particular UC 
campus, so is a preliminary financial 
aid package. 

So one of the major benefits of 
the waitlist program is that it doesn’t 
shortchange students in terms of 
financial aid or housing — as long 
as students turn in their information 
on time, they won’t be far behind if 
they are admitted. 

Students can get off the waitlist 
as late as July — and then have to 
make a quick decision on whether 
to attend the university. According 
to UC Davis, the student has only 
three days to make her decision to 
attend the school and reject all other 
offers. 

This is not enough time to look 
at financial-aid options and make 
the most informed decision regard-
ing something as important as 
college matriculation. UCSB gives 
students one week, which is better, 
but also makes for a rushed deci-
sion. The California State University 
system, on the other hand, gives two 
weeks for a transfer decision.

Overall, the implementation of a 
waitlist system has both its benefits 
and problems. The waitlist system 
for both freshmen and transfers is 
important to manage enrollment. 
For the University of California, it 
is profitable to have every open spot 
filled with students from the waitlist 
system. 

For incoming freshman and 
transfers, it provides hope of get-
ting into a school they would have 
otherwise been rejected from. While 
the waitlist system adds stress to the 
admissions process that students 
have to face, this “second chance” at 
enrollment is well worth the extra 
work it will entail.

Neurologist Jacopo Annese’s dissected 
brains could not only help scientists solve 
some of  the most stumping mysteries of  
consciousness, but could also provide a 
whole new outlook on anatomy’s most 

“hushed-away” field of  study. 

By Mina Nilchian 
Associate Focus Editor

T he connection between who we are as people and how our brains are wired has stumped neuroscientists for decades. It’s that elusive connection that Dr. 
Jacopo Annese, a neurologist at UCSD’s Brain 
Observatory hopes to learn more about  with 
the help of his team and around a thousand 
donated brains. He wants to know how some-
one’s individual attributes can be explained by 
the unique mechanics of their brain.

“Everybody’s intrigued by the humanistic 
aspect,” Annese said. “These are not just speci-
mens. There’s an emphasis I want to place on 
the person.”

Dr. Annese said his field of study, with its 
dependence on donors who have passed away 
and its Frankenstein associations, has been 
considered “ghoulish,” 

In a previous Guardian interview (“Mind 
Matters,” Feb. 28, 2011), Annese spoke of his 
newest endeavor, a project called “The Brain 
Library,” which aims to collect brains of one 
thousand local donors in the next 10 years in 
order to get a better idea of what each brain 
tells about the person who donated it. 

In the project, each donor’s brain will be cut 
into thin slices, placed on glass slides and pho-
tographed individually using advanced micro-
scopic technology. The pictures are turned 
into a 3-D image, then put into a database that

W arren College senior Maclen Zilber has an impressive resume.In addition to wrapping up a dual 
degree in political science and economics (he’s 
projected to graduate in a couple quarters), Zilber’s 
a current Warren College A.S. Senator, has served 
as undergraduate representative on the UCSD 
Academic Senate’s Program Review Committee, is 
a trustee on the UCSD Student Foundation and is 
rush adviser for honor fraternity Phi Sigma Pi.

Zilber is also 18 years old.
“There was a couple reasons [why I left high 

school early],” Zilber, who left high 
school at age 15 for community col-
lege, said. “One was that I thought 
it would save a lot of time and 
money, the other reasons was that 
my mom had been diagnosed with 
Lou Gehrig’s disease, which is a 
terminal illness, so I wanted to be 
able to spend more time with her 
and also to have a chance of gradu-
ating from college while she was 
still alive.”

Zilber’s tenacious drive came to 
the attention of UCSD when the 
precocious coed was singled out 
by former President Bill Clinton 
for the “initiative” — or project — 
he conceived during last month’s 
Clinton Global Initiative University 
conference.

Zilber’s idea, called “Incentives for Opportunity,” 
would work to raise awareness of the 2009 American 
Opportunity Tax Credit, which allows students a 
$2,500 annual tax credit for books, tuition, supplies 

and other school necessities. 
“It was something that sort of randomly came 

to me out of the blue,” Zilber said. “I was putting 
together my tax information and I realized that I 
was going to have to pay in the neighborhood of a 
month’s rent of taxes — and I realized that this Tax 
Credit was available and it was going to offset my 
entire tax burden. And I looked it up and I realized 
that it was being utilized at a far lower rate than was 
expected. So, I thought it seemed like a good sort of 
minor initiative to change things up at the margins.”

Since the IRS wasn’t exactly making strides to 
reach out to college students, the East Bay 
native took it upon himself to spread the 
word. But Zilber never planned to advance 
to the second round at the CGIU confer-
ence; in fact, he applied to CGIU on a whim.

“To be honest, filling out applications to 
CGIU was never a big part of the process,” 
Zilber said. “I truthfully assumed that I 
wouldn’t be accepted into CGIU, let alone 
have it be recognized the way it was. I decid-
ed to submit it because I wanted to get ideas 
from a bunch of other policy-minded young 
leaders, and I think in that regard CGIU was 
very helpful.”

Still, the former president was impressed.
“Mac Zilber’s from right here at UC San 

Diego,” Clinton said at the CGIU conference 
on April 1. “Now, this is probably one of 
those projects that’s going to be copied after 
you leave here, which is the whole point of 

this, by the way. Anyway, here’s what Mac Zilber’s 
going to do — he’s come up with creative ways to

POWWOW

, 
INFOCUS grad NIght

The Alumni Association threw a party for 2011 UCSD grads this past Tuesday, April 26. The evening (which lasted from 6:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m.) included a raffle 
(prizes ranged from a Contiki tour to a mix of eight chocolate 
bars from Chuao Chocolatier) and opportunities for students to 
discuss post-grad options, sign a 2011 class plaque and stock up 
on graduation gear. 
   Hundreds of students were greeted by an orchestra at the 
entryway, as they walked down the red carpet into the UCSD 
bookstore, where the festivities were held. Inside, ravenous 
students crowded around the food (that was, unfortunately, all 
placed on one table rather than spread out over numerous loca-

tions in the bookstore). 
        Fortunately, the variety of food made up for the inconve-
nience — treats included an assortment of cheeses, fruits, cook-
ies, brownies, quesadillas, spinach puffs and other bite-sized 
snacks. The stairway leading downstairs was decorated with 
columns of blue and yellow balloons, where students could 
participate in a book signing and drop off their 11 raffle tickets.

fOCUS MONDAY, MAY 2, 2011 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 9 

Annese calls “the Library of Congress for Brains”. 
Since then, Annese’s brainchild has grown, 

with the goal of collecting a thousand donors in 
the next 10 years becoming more and more fea-
sible. And the library is also home to one of the 
most famous brains in history: H.M., who was 
known by neurologists around for the world for 
a rare condition that made him unable to retain 
short-term memory. The project also plans 
to study the brains of an actress who played 
a flying monkey in “The Wizard of Oz,” and 
another famed neurological patient, S.M., who 
is renowned for her inability to feel fear. 

The Brain Library is distinguished from 
its predecessors by its personal approach. As 
opposed to the traditional brain bank, which 
normally only notes the gender and age of a 
donor, the Brain Library aims to get a compre-
hensive biography behind every donor’s brain 
in order to determine the connection between 
the brain’s anatomical structure and its owner’s 
personality.

“Brain library is a much better term than 
brain bank. It has connotations and prerogatives 
that I don’t agree with,” Annese said, stating 
that in the past, the nature of brain research has 
given the field a more “hush-hush” element.

High-profile donors and recent media atten-
tion has also put the Brain Library in the spot-
light. One particular reason for all the attention 
is Dr. Annese’s April 20 interview in Bloomberg 
Businessweek, a business and finance publica-
tion that boldly claimed that Dr. Annese “wants 
Donald Trump’s brain.”

“The cases that will be informative will be 
[those] whose lives are documented very well,” 
Annese said. He cited Donald Trump, business 
mogul and recent politician, as a prime example 
of the type of brain he wants to profile because of 
the publication of his recent biography. 

“But we’re not in the lab waiting for him,” he 
added. “It was sensationalized.”

While Annese believes the article didn’t cor-
rectly capture the project’s goal (Annese prefers 
to be approached by donors rather than to ask for 
them), the media eruption has helped the project 
grow.

“We got 2,000 responses last week from the 

ABC article,” said Annese, whose project aims 
to collect brains mainly from the San Diego 
area. “There is overwhelming interest, considering 
we’ve not really put out a campaign. It’s based on 
word of mouth.”

With the attention his project is getting, 
Annese believes that it could become a global 
undertaking, but he’s still looking for interested 
volunteers in San Diego.

“The work is intense; we’re 
always looking for smart, 
hardworking volunteers,” 
said Annese, noting that half 
of the paid assistants in the 
Brain Library were once vol-
unteers. “They’ve always been 
a very good source of fresh 
ideas.”

  The response to the proj-
ect has been positive from 
both the general public and 
the scientific community, and 
Annese is currently working 
a paper regarding his findings 
on H.M.’s brain. 

But beyond its widespread 
public success, Annese says 
that his work in pathology 
has affected him personally, 

as he’s begun to change his own outlook on his 
work.

“As an anatomist, I’m not biased,” he said. “In 
a way, it’s almost like an empathy that I’ve devel-
oped. When a person donates their brain, they’re 
interesting in their own right, whether they’re 
Democrat or Republican, or what views they agree 
on.”

Annese appreciates what he considers a “shift-
ing paradigm” in the field of pathology. The recent 
media coverage of his project has helped lend a 
certain allure to Annese’s field.

“When you’re talking about anatomy and 
pathology, it is harder to make it seem ‘sexy,’” 
Annesse said. “I’m glad that beauty prevailed. 
With the glass slides and images, people appreciate 
the beauty of this work.”

educate his fellow students about changes in 
the American Federal Tax Credit.”

Since CGIU, Zilber has been working 
to release a survey about the American 
Opportunity for Tax Credit to the student 
body.

“It’s going to be a multi-step process,” 
Zilber said. “The first step is data gathering, 
a scientific survey to let us know where we’re 
starting from — how many students use the 
credit, how many students file their own 
taxes, what’s their income, year, demograph-
ics and all that so we know exactly where 
to target.”

Zilber hopes to release the survey in the 
coming weeks so that students will have 
enough time to respond before finals week. 
Eventually, he hopes the movement will gain 
enough ground to spread to other university 
campuses.

“The project is going to run at the very 
least through the next year and if the sec-
ond survey shows that it’s worked and it’s 
increased the Tax Credit by some large 
amount of money then, at that point, the 
initiative would probably continue to other 
schools,” Zilber said.

Zilber plans to attend law school, after 
taking a few years off to, you know, age.

“I’m probably going to go to law school, 
though I won’t do it right away because I 
think being 19 or 20 and starting law school 
would be a little intense,” Zilber said. “So, I 
think I’m going to spend a few years working 
either working in Teach for America or D.C. 
or something before I go to law school.”

Not that Zilber plans on abandoning the 
project altogether post-graduation.

“In terms of after I graduate, if the 
project has done well, or if I’m at the point 
where it can be scaled, I’ll probably keep 
some oversight of it while also giving off a 
lot of control to the now-presidents of the 
various colonies that there will, hopefully, 
be at other schools,” he said.

SPORTS MONDAY, MAY 2, 2011 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 11 

13-10 and 14-11. After a very slow first quarter, the Tritons 
trailed 2-1, but junior hole set Kirsten Bates and freshman utility 
Sarah Lizotte scored back-to-back goals with 2:18 left in the sec-
ond quarter to take the lead, which the Tritons would never give 
back. The Roadrunners scored on their next possession due to an 
ejection, but Lizotte came back right afterward to reestablish the 
one goal lead heading into halftime.

The speed of the second quarter carried into the third quar-
ter, as the Tritons scored three unanswered goals early in the 
quarter before Bakersfield had an opportunity to respond. But 
Bakersfield scored to bring the score to 7-4 with one minute left 
in the quarter, and made a desperation shot in the closing sec-
onds of the quarter to pull within two. 

Lizotte and Crowell scored on the first two possessions of the 
quarter for the Tritons to take a 9-5 lead. The teams traded goals 
and Lizotte notched her seventh consecutive hat trick, bringing 
the Tritons an 11-7 victory.

“I was excited when I saw we were going to be facing 
Bakersfield and Santa Clara because we had already beaten those 
teams,” Kreutzkamp said, “and we could do it again.”

On Saturday, the Tritons faced off against Santa Clara in the 
semifinal round. The Tritons had beaten Santa Clara 12-10 ear-
lier in the season, but their most recent matchup was a 9-8 double 
overtime nail-biter where the Tritons squeezed out a victory after 
overcoming a first-half deficit. 

The Tritons scored first, but then they slowed down consid-
erably, allowing the Broncos to take a lead and drag it out to 4-2 
midway through the fourth quarter. 

“I give credit to Santa Clara and Bakerfield,” Kreutzkamp said. 
“They knew they had to come out strong against us and they did.”

But just under halfway through the quarter, senior Felicia 
Orozco scored to ignite the Triton offense and Bates added anoth-
er goal with under a minute to play, tying the game at halftime. 

Bates scored first in the third quarter to give UCSD the lead 
for the first time since the opening minute of the match, but the 
Broncos were prepared for the Tritons’ speed game and pulled 
the score to a tie at 6-6 to start the fourth.  Bates again responded 
as she scored on a 6-on-5 to open the fourth quarter, and junior 
driver Katherine Biehl scored next to reestablish the two-goal 
lead. Though Santa Clara did score to bring the game within one 
point with two minutes to play, Lizotte scored her fifth goal of the 
tournament as insurance to seal the 9-7 victory. The win put the 
Tritons into the title game for the second straight year.

“It’s kind of a relief, but we are the second seed,” Kreutzkamp 
said. “We’re supposed to be here. But it still feels good to get back 
to the championship game.”

Crowell was named MVP of the tournament. She was joined 
by Bates and Lizotte on the All-Tournament First Team, while 
Natalie Peng made the Second Team.

honors — retired the next six batters. 
Gaito allowed the Toros only two hits in 
the game.

Mya Romero — the CCAA Freshman 
of the Year — hit a triple in the third and 
was brought home by a single by freshman 
Caitlin Brown, putting the Tritons up 2-0.

With the win, the Tritons advanced to 
the winner’s bracket of the CCAA tourna-
ment.

Sonoma State 5, UCSD 2
The Tritons’ second game of the 

CCAA tournament pitted the conference’s 
top two pitchers against each other: Gaito 
(26-3) and Sonoma’s Lippard (24-8).  

In just her third loss of the season, 
Gaito went the distance but allowed 14 
hits.  Conversely, Lippard allowed only 
three hits while also striking out four 
Tritons.

The two pitchers kept the game score-
less until the fourth inning when Ali 
Palermo homered to left field to put the 
Seawolves up 1-0.

 UCSD responded in their next at bat. 
With two outs, senior Rhiannon Ousley 
doubled to right field to bring Brown in to 
score. Ousley advanced to third on a wild 
pitch, and was brought home by a single 

from Taylor Sepulveda.
The Tritons would only record one hit 

in their remaining at bats, while Sonoma 
would tack on four more runs to take the 
win.

UCSD 6, CSU Dominguez Hills 2
After dropping the game against 

Sonoma State, the Tritons fell into the 
elimination game for a rematch against 
Cal State Dominguez Hills.  

The Tritons took the early lead against 
the Toros. In the second inning, UCSD 
took advantage of a pair of Toro errors 
to go up 4-0. With Lyndsay Gaylord — 
pinch-running for Brown — on third and 
Woofter on first, Taylor Sepulveda bunted.  
All three Tritons made their way home off 
throwing errors made by the Toro catcher 
and second baseman.  

Dominguez was able to recover two 
runs to put the game at 5-2 in the fifth 
inning. But UCSD wrapped up the game 
with a solo home run from Woofter in 
the seventh.

Freshman pitcher Jennifer Manuel 
(3-4) allowed only four hits in her 4.2 
innings.

“We scored early and did what we 
needed to on the field,” assistant coach 
Jessica Millsap said.  [Manuel] gave us 

a strong start and Gaito closed it down. 
It was a great game, the team looked 
great against Dominguez. We had a rough 
loss against Sonoma, but the girls really 
showed their character and heart in the 
elimination game.”

Sonoma State 1, UCSD 0
In a rematch between aces Gaito and 

Lippard, one swing of the bat decided the 
conference champion as the Seawolves’ 
Rochelle Vanyi launched a second-inning 
home run that proved to be decisive.

Both pitchers went the distance, and 
both turned in sparkling performances. 
Lippard pitched a complete-game no-hit-
ter, although she did allow six walks and 
hit two batters. Gaito allowed five hits, but 
it was the deep ball that counted and gave 
Sonoma the title.

With a 22-10 conference record--
the best in the program’s history — the 
Tritons captured the regular season title. 
UCSD also had four Tritons named to the 
All-Conference team — Gaito, Romero, 
Lesovsky and Woofter.  

The Tritons are ranked first in the 
West Region, and are likely to receive an 
at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament. 
Sonoma receives an automatic bid for 
winning the CCAA title.  

with a mammoth nine-run second inning. 
UCSD batted around plus three batters, 
and five Tritons had RBI, including a three-
run home run from Tagmyer.

“Tag [Tagmyer] is special, he flat-out 
competes for every day and that’s what 
makes him a leader and a winner,” head 
coach Dan O’Brien said.

But the Wildcats slowly chipped away at 
the lead, plating a run in the fourth inning 
and three more in the fifth. Triton starter 
Jeff Rauh was knocked out of the game 
after giving up seven runs on nine hits in 
4 1/3 innings. With the score 9-7, neither 
team could score until the Tritons added 

two more runs in the top of the eighth 
inning thanks to a two-RBI single by short-
stop Garrett Tuck. Chico responded with 
a run in their half of the inning, and the 
Tritons did not score in the top of the ninth, 
leading both teams into the final frame 
with the score 11-8. 

Triton reliever Tuma allowed the first 
two batters to reach base, and was removed 
for Simmons. The Wildcats scored on an 
RBI single and sacrifice fly, but Simmons 
struck out the final batter with the tying 
run on second base. 

“I can’t say enough about how our 
guys competed all weekend,” O’Brien said. 
“Today wasn’t pretty, but we found a way to 

finish, and that’s all that matters.”
The Tritons are now 34-12 overall, and 

25-12 in conference play. The Wildcats 
dropped to 27-14 and 21-13. UCSD has 
won its last 13 games, while Chico has 
dropped five straight. 

The No. 7 Tritons took sole possession 
of first place in the CCAA with the sweep.

“The guys deserved the reward of 
first place, considering what they’ve been 
through and how they responded to a lot of 
early-season adversity,” O’Brien said.

The Tritons return to action this week 
with a home-and-home series with Cal 
State San Bernardino to wrap up the regu-
lar season.

Championship weekend

Coming into the WWPA Championship game with No. 8 Loyola Marymount on Sunday, the Tritons’ record against ranked opponents this 
season was an abysmal — 0-14. The Tritons bucked 
history in a big way, scoring a stunning six goals in the 
fourth quarter to get a come-from-behind victory to 
take home their first WWPA Championship since water 
polo became an NCAA sport.

The Tritons traveled north to Hayward this week-
end to participate in the three-day Western Water Polo 
Association conference championship tournament at 
Chabot Community College.

The Tritons lost to Loyola Marymount University 
13-7 at home during the regular season and hadn’t 
beaten a ranked team all season, but were hoping for the 
best on the final day of the tournament.

“Just because you haven’t done it yet, doesn’t 
mean you won’t do it eventually,” head coach Brad 
Kreutzkamp said. “We just got to get a fast start and put 
them against the wall.”

Instead, the Tritons found themselves against the 
wall, trailing 9-7 and 10-8 early in the fourth quarter. 
Jessica Tran scored her first goal of the game with 6:32 
remaining to make the score 9-8, although Loyola 
responded with a goal of its own less than 30 seconds 

later. Tran scored again and senior utility Hanalei 
Crowell added another goal, tying the score at 10.  Tran 
then put in her third goal of the quarter with 2:35 left 
to give the Tritons the lead. Loyola once again tied the 
game, but goals from Crowell and Katherine Biehle in 
the final two minutes sealed the win for the Tritons. 

“I haven’t seen more one-sided officiating in a game 
like this,” Kruetzkamp said.  “We had our top three play-
ers major, so we pulled people off the bench, but they 
came through.”

The Tritons earned an automatic bid to the 
2011 National Collegiate Women’s Water Polo 
Championships hosted by the University of Michigan 
in Ann Arbor, Mich., May 13-15. The Tritons also 
snapped Loyola’s 37-game conference winning streak.

“I’m on cloud nine, this feels great,” Kruetzkamp 
said. “We were down two going into the fourth quarter, 
but we scored six points and shut them down.”

In getting to the championship game, the Tritons 
had to face familiar foes. On Friday afternoon, the sec-
ond-seeded Tritons were matched up against seventh 
seed Cal State Bakersfield, a team whom the Tritons 
played and beat twice in the regular season by scores of

TrITONS GO TOP WITh ChICO STATE SWEEP

By Rachel Uda
Senior Staff Writer

SOFTBALL —While UCSD had 
the best pitcher in the conference 
in Camille Gaito, Sonoma State had 
arguably the second best in Samantha 
Lippard. Even with the regular sea-
son title under their belt, the confer-
ence tournament was never going 
to be easy for the No. 8 Tritons, and 
two duels between the aces narrowly 
tipped in favor of the Seawolves as 
the Tritons finished as runner-ups in 
the CCAA Championships.

UCSD 2, CSU Dominguez Hills 0
The top-seeded Tritons faced 

fourth-seeded Cal State Dominguez 

Hills in their first game of the CCAA 
championships.  

Senior Kris Lesovsky put the 
Tritons up in their first at bat, with 
a leadoff solo home run to left field.

Leading 1-0, the Tritons held 
Dominguez Hills, ending the first 
inning with a double play started by 
senior third baseman Sarah Woofter. 
Woofter caught the Toro runner at 
second, where senior second base-
man Jennifer De Fazio threw to first 
to make the out.

conference pitcher of the week for 
the fourth time this season, while

NolaN THomas/Guardian File

Only a home run seperated the Tritons and Sonoma State as the Seawolves took the conference title.

UCSD water polo wins its first conference title 
since 2000 in dramatic fashion, while Triton 

softball narrowly falls in the title game. 

gaMe 1
UCSD 9, Chico 3

Center fielder Danny Susdorf went four-for-six with 
two RBI, and third baseman Evan Kehoe and catcher 
Kellen Lee had two RBI apiece as the Tritons piled on the 
offense to take the opening game of the four-game series. 

Triton ace Tim Shibuya (9-3) pitched 7 2/3 innings, 
giving up three runs on five hits while striking out nine 
batters and surrendering just one walk. 

The Tritons had a 3-0 lead in the top of the fifth after 
a two-run single from Lee, but the Wildcats responded 
by plating two of their own in the bottom half of the 
inning. From there, the Tritons put the game out of 
reach by scoring in each of the final four innings. Justin 
Burns and Daniel Simmons did not allow a hit in 1 1/3 
innings of relief.

gaMe 2
UCSD 9, Chico 1

Triton starter Guido Knudson pitched a complete-
game gem, and the Tritons used a five-run second inning 
to take the first half of Saturday’s doubleheader.

Knudson (7-3) gave up one run on five hits, struck 
out four and didn’t allow a walk while going the distance. 
The right-hander has now picked up the win in his last 
four starts. 

First baseman Blake Tagmyer led off the second 
with a double, one of six for the Tritons in the game. 
Lee brought him home with a single to left field, and 
shortstop Garrett Tuck, left fielder Aaron Bauman and 
designated hitter Nick La Face all had RBI in the inning.

Chico did not score until the bottom of the eighth 
inning, when the game was already out of reach.

gaMe 3
UCSD 6, Chico 5

The Tritons squeaked by Chico in the second half 
of the doubleheader to guarantee they would take the 
conference lead back home with them.

Triton starter Taylor Austin lasted just 2 2/3 innings 
after giving up three runs in the second inning, but 
Chico’s Jordan Lindebaum was worse after giving up 
four runs 3 2/3 innings. UCSD first took the lead in 
the fourth inning, thanks to a solo shot from Lee that 
brought the score to 4-3. The Tritons tacked on two more 
in the fifth and sixth, scoring on an error and a hit batter, 
respectively. 

The Tritons got themselves into a jam in the sixth 
inning with score 6-3, when reliever Justin Burns 
allowed the first two Wildcat batters to reach base. Elias 
Tuma came into relieve, and had a forgettable outing 
as he allowed the runners to score and load the bases. 
Simmons came in to dispel the danger, and forced a 
groundout to strand all three runners. He put down the 
side in order in the seventh inning — the last of the game 
— to pick up his first save of the season. 

Despite a shaky outing, Burns (2-1) picked up the 
win for the Tritons.

The Tritons outlasted the Wildcats to sweep the series 
in a wild finale.

tom of the first, but the Tritons responded right away
